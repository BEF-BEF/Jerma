1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,580
Ah yes, the the return of the dentist. I almost just said happy Halloween. Hey, happy Halloween

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:24,780
everybody. That whole month has just been deleted in my brain. Quick, slime them. See what you guys

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,929
don't know is I have all those actions still. I might just turn a stream on one day and if I

4
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:42,219
do though something happens. I have those forever. I get to keep those. But uh yeah, we're starting

5
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,299
a little bit or I almost said early too. First happy Halloween then hey we're starting early.

6
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:54,219
Now we're starting late because it's Thanksgiving and I wanted to give some time to not just

7
00:00:54,219 --> 00:01:01,450
start streaming at one two o'clock pacific. I figured it's probably better this way. So

8
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,019
we're gonna continue the Outer Worlds. This is gonna be the last stream you see from me for

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,819
a little bit. I'll be gone for about three or four days because I have a procedure I have to do

10
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:23,379
and it requires some annoying fasting as of tomorrow and then I have to do it

11
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:33,700
and then I have to be on drugs. So you won't see me for a three or four days. So after today

12
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,579
this is just gonna be we're gonna end the Outer Worlds tonight. Even if I don't get to the end,

13
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,049
I'll probably just finish it off stream. It depends on how close we get because I really

14
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:52,010
don't know if this stream is gonna be more than five or six hours. I don't know. It might be five,

15
00:01:52,010 --> 00:02:02,260
it might be four, it might be six, this might be eight. But happy Thanksgiving if you're celebrating

16
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,540
it or if you've not celebrated it yet. If you just got this notification and you're at the dinner

17
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:14,180
table, then put me on as loud as it goes, put me on speaker and sit me on the table.

18
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:30,710
Yeah, can I get the um, can you get, can I, can I get the peas? Thank you. The turkey is absolutely

19
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,509
delicious by the way. It's one of the best turkeys I've ever had and I really am not, I know I say

20
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:41,990
that every single year. I know I say that, listen mom, I know I say that every year, every time you've

21
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:49,159
ever made a turkey, I say it's the best turkey I've ever had. But this one is for real. Damn,

22
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:57,580
that's good. Oh, sorry, I mean darn, sorry about that. All right, now turn me off because I'm gonna

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,569
start swearing and I know like your grandfather's not gonna like it. Am I off? All right, good.

24
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:12,840
Anyways, let's play the Outer Worlds. All of a sudden, grandpa's like, Outer Worlds?

25
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,490
No, no, keep that on, keep that on. Hey, anything to take me away from your family like arguing

26
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:27,860
about politics? We can argue about like the fake politics that are in the Outer Worlds,

27
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:37,419
right? You don't need, you don't need, listen grandpa, we don't need to argue anymore.

28
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:54,250
Just listen to me. All right, let's get going. I like this song. I wish it was not just the

29
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:04,379
level up screen. What about those emails? Well, I've read tons of emails on computers already.

30
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:12,900
I've read a lot of emails. Yeah, we'll see how this goes. Just gonna keep playing it. If you

31
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,539
don't know, you probably, if this is the first stream you've been to and you're like, why is

32
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:23,019
you, what does this have to do with dentists? That is a 15 plus hour long build up for the joke

33
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:29,300
and there's not much I could say. It would take me 15 hours to explain it to you.

34
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:45,800
So let's go. I just love dental health, yeah. All right, let the game load. Hold on. All right,

35
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,220
so the last thing we did was, I remember I was like really tired last night. I didn't listen

36
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,589
to a single thing this person said. I think I specifically said this guy's born the fuck

37
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:59,829
out of me and then like I turned off the stream. So I did what, I don't remember what this was.

38
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,600
Then I killed him. No, he's still alive. All right, here we go. This is, we have to go back to

39
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,259
the information broker promised to find the location of the chemicals needed

40
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:21,180
by Phineas. Problem is he hasn't delivered the intel on time and hasn't provided an explanation.

41
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,740
Travel to Monarch, find him and obtain the data. Okay, this is where I am now.

42
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,459
The broker can't deliver the location of the chemicals until you stop the Iconoclasts and MSI

43
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:39,500
transmissions that are interfering with the tower. Okay, so Sanjar leads MSI out of Stellar Bay

44
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,139
and Graham Bryant leads the Iconoclasts out of Amber Heights. Earning their favor might

45
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,600
convince them to stop transmitting. Complete the quest, bolt with his name for Sanjar to start

46
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,370
earning MSI's trust. All right, so what do I want to do here?

47
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:11,420
Should I just go just take a chainsaw and just cut the tower down? Well, let's go to,

48
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:21,350
Sanjar needs a bolt 52 cartridge. I remember this part. All right, let's get into the good graces

49
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:29,379
of Sanjar. So we need to get into the arms building. Now, where the hell is that? Oh,

50
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,540
fuck. Sorry, I forgot. Yeah, I forgot. I forgot I was going to shoot that guy in the head right

51
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,939
when the stream started. Oops, I forgot. Yeah, I was like actually planning on doing that too.

52
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:51,899
That's all right. Damn it. Oh, I was too busy like thinking about Thanksgiving. Oh,

53
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:58,139
that was going to be fun too. Damn it. I really like was going to do that. I was going to actually

54
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:07,939
do that. Begin Broadway. I can start. I can turn the stream button on. Authorized broadcaster,

55
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,540
don't even try to pretend you're unaware that all broadcasting is currently locked down.

56
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,139
Please return to milling about the break room and lamenting that internship and corporate

57
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,899
arbitration that you never finished. Or to override the lock on recording, simply enter your admin

58
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:27,939
username and password in the command line. Oh, you can't maybe you should have been nicer to Val.

59
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:37,769
That's not good. All right, let's go. Wow, where is this? Is this on the other planet?

60
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:56,089
Time to turn on the webcam. Not time to turn on the webcam. All right, now where is this thing?

61
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:12,740
That's very far away, but it's not far away from here. Show us those teeth. Hurry up and do

62
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:28,759
something funny. Hurry. Hurry, quick. You'll get used to it. Hurry, quick, quick. Rush a joke so

63
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,519
I can do minus two because it wasn't funny because you didn't take the time to prepare

64
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:57,899
something interesting. Quick, hurry. Are you all right? My investment.

65
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:11,370
Shoot that rat with some knockback. You pull out of the archive here and start saying like

66
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:23,450
words that you like. When in doubt, say a word that everybody likes. Automatic comedy increase.

67
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:50,779
You're good. Game's too loud. I got you. Solved. I don't want to find all these stupid monsters,

68
00:09:51,419 --> 00:10:06,730
but I guess I kind of have to. God damn it. All right, user special. Don't call them stupid.

69
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,440
Well, they are stupid. I mean, their intelligence level is not very high.

70
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:23,909
That doesn't mean I don't. Neither is my character. Yeah, that's okay. Call me stupid.

71
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,830
This character is stupid, but so is that animal that's right there. This animal is also stupid.

72
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:43,909
Why did I shoot the Colossus? I probably should not have shot the Colossus. That was stupid.

73
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:52,730
You are absolutely inclined to call me fucking stupid for that. Time to run. Wait, it's in here.

74
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:05,720
Holy shit. He just almost insta-killed me. Oh, I can't even open this door. Oh, he still sees me.

75
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:15,289
I'm dead. Heal. How do I heal? I don't have any heals left. Oh, okay. Well, that's a disaster.

76
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:31,049
How do I not have any heals left? God damn it. I'm just gonna go the other way.

77
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:43,620
I only have one heal. Who took them all? Wait, hold on a minute. I gotta go to Stellar Bay.

78
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:56,440
I gotta buy some heals. What happened to Sam and Max? They're still on the ship.

79
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:11,740
I was just trying two other dentists. Oh, yeah. Okay, well, that's still there. You guys,

80
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:22,120
that's true. All right. I need just a vending machine or something. All right, do you sell stuff?

81
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:41,220
Not the stuff I want. There we go. Buy them. Okay. What is this? Baked beans? No. Oh, fuck me.

82
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:53,299
Really? That's the same goddamn syringe. I bought the wrong thing. All right, where's the medic?

83
00:12:53,299 --> 00:13:07,620
Where's the person that sells medicine? There you are. I would like to buy something.

84
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:16,179
Oh, god damn it. Why can I not buy anything from you? Aren't you the town medic? What?

85
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,210
Steal? I can't even steal. I already took everything from our house. Is there a vending

86
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:34,649
machine in there or do I have to go find the vending machine? You don't sell, do you?

87
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,169
If it isn't the famous hacker enjoying Stellar Bay, what can I do for you?

88
00:13:42,679 --> 00:14:01,799
Nothing. Vending machine. Vendor. Okay. The yacht club vendor. Can I not see what these are? Vending

89
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,159
machine. Like, I can't. It's just there? All right. Well, it's just there apparently.

90
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:17,580
Go buy a yacht. Wasn't this the one I was just using? Maybe not. Okay. What's in here?

91
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:27,350
There's no heels here. Don't tell me I have to travel to like another galaxy to buy heels.

92
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:43,480
That's not going to happen, right? Where's this other one? In here? What was I just? Okay. So

93
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,799
where's this one? All right. Time to get in a spaceship and travel across the galaxy to buy

94
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:58,730
stim packs. Well, well. What? Isn't often we see new folk in Stellar Bay? First drink some.

95
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,879
I'm sure I'll take a drink. Enjoy. If you're keeping Neoka company, you'll need a few to

96
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,120
keep up with her. Sure. Do you have any heels? I need a person on this planet who can keep up with me.

97
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Wait, we are talking about a drinking contest, right? Now what can I do for you?

98
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:26,700
No, you just have booze. All right. Well, what is the, what's my, what's my actual ship?

99
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:37,850
This is a heel, right? Injectable healing enhancer. Heals 20. Okay. My goodness.

100
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:59,289
There we go. Good. All right. I got enough. Oh, where is it? There it is. All right. I got 39

101
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:07,610
and I got this, uh, what do I want to use? Critical damage plus 15%. Yeah. Let's like use this shit.

102
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:13,669
How about the wrong thing? No, it's not. Heals 25% health over two seconds.

103
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:32,679
Isn't that just like a quick heal? You're going to get addicted to drugs. That's all right. He's

104
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:40,440
already addicted. No, I've been breathing in all kinds of gases and my character's fine. No,

105
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:55,350
the only thing that's happened to me this whole game is I'm afraid of monsters. That's it. It's

106
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:05,859
given me a, it gives you a choice if you want to be afraid of monsters or not. Okay. Let's go.

107
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:12,599
It's like, you know, you've seen quite a few monsters. Are you scared of them? Yes. No. Okay.

108
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,440
But if you were scared of them, we would give you a point to put in. Ooh, I'm scared of monsters.

109
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:28,140
They terrify me. I'm just like lying on a fucking job interview. It's like, all right, let's just

110
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:47,480
move. Don't attack the Colossus. Oh, for the love of God, I'm just running. I don't even have it

111
00:17:47,480 --> 00:18:00,819
selected. Yes, I do. I get into the arms building. I can't even, I have to like find a key card or

112
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:13,380
something. I can't even lock, pick this fucking door. It's so dead. There's a whole entire town

113
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:26,460
of monsters is chasing at us. Why are you using that? Good. The big one can't even get in. Just

114
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:45,609
feed them in here. Okay. Uh, how am I supposed to get in that building? The bolt 52 is an abandoned

115
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,849
building north of stellar Bay. So I need a key card to get into there, but I don't have one. Or

116
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:54,900
I have to get up. I need one of those lock pickers. You guys just, you're doing fine out there.

117
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:27,349
Oh my God. I need one mag lock. Is that seriously the only way I can get in this building?

118
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:40,390
I almost just shot you. It has to be another way. Where's the big guy? All the way down there. Good.

119
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:51,640
All right. So front door. I needed one of those, uh, lockpick things. This doesn't work or a key

120
00:19:51,640 --> 00:20:09,369
card, but where the hell would the key card be? I can't jump up or anything. No, I have to go in

121
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:19,109
the door. There's no way for me to climb, right? All right. Well, let's try to find the, one of

122
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:35,269
those door openers. I can't seriously be the only way you can get in that building. Let's try to

123
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:47,769
find one. That's a good question. What about here? Can I open up like a panel in the back?

124
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,319
Let's find a door opener. I just need to find one of those, uh, not the stunts, like the, the mag

125
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:21,910
picks. Evicted. Can't go in. Uh, nothing was in here. What about in here? Over here? Well, all

126
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:46,390
right. We're going to keep looking. Blue bodies. Monsters will have a door open, a pick on them.

127
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:57,420
I don't think so. Only monsters live in this whole galaxy here. This whole planet is just these

128
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,700
aliens. I don't think they're picking locks. I think they're eating people and knocking doors

129
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:31,460
down with their tails. Give me in here. Come on. No, shit. I think I've seen more weapon mods than

130
00:22:31,460 --> 00:23:03,779
I have mag picks. Just meat. Everybody's evicted. I'm just like going back to the town now. What

131
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:11,299
did I do for Thanksgiving? I did not do very much because, uh, at this household we did the

132
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:20,170
Thanksgiving a little early because I, as of yesterday, could not eat a lot of the stuff

133
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:30,390
that is served at Thanksgiving. So no peas, no corn, no nuts. No. So I was kind of like,

134
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:47,460
let's just do it early. So we did it a little early. Okay. Am I about to literally just bust

135
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:59,140
a door down with my fucking face? How do I get up there? There's a ladder there, but can I jump

136
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:21,210
from here? I can't jump from here to there. You can. I mean, maybe I can. Oh my God.

137
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:45,559
I wonder, can I get off of this planet? This planet sucks. I have to like de-aggro the gigantic

138
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:58,359
guy. What's the aggro range? All right. Well I de-aggro him, but I have to cross the fucking

139
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:18,839
mode again. I can't kill it. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn

140
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:34,619
around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Good. Keep eating. Keep eating Ellie. All right.

141
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:54,019
Now turn around. He's going to see me. Maybe not. Okay. So can I jump from here to there to there?

142
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,140
I like guys saying that there's a ladder. I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about.

143
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:15,269
I see that one, but not over here. Is it a ladder on the other building? If I have to kill one more

144
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:29,400
of these Warcraft monsters, I swear to God, anytime I like go up here and then cross from the top.

145
00:26:29,400 --> 00:27:02,170
Okay. I see. I mean it's a ladder in another game. I didn't realize this was here. All right. I made

146
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:26,200
it. Let me in, child. Let me in. Sorry. Couldn't help it. Who's there? Why don't you keep that

147
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:39,339
going? That would be hilarious. This person would think that you were a conscious, thought-thinking

148
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,900
raptidon. I ran in here and now the door's locked. Help. You got locked in? Well, I need to get in

149
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,019
that room. I need to get in there, but maybe I'll let you starve first. That's terrible.

150
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:28,730
Open the door. I'll just go in. Don't worry. I'll get in there. 50. 40. That's a lot. All right. Can

151
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:36,470
I go up? Do I go up and around? Oh, there's the mag pack. That's what I was looking for.

152
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:54,569
View executive reviews. Loading last access document. Sandra has a bad habit of padding

153
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:59,529
his reports with numbers and statistics. Not very good with slogans, jingles, and or taglines.

154
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:04,539
Presentations tend to be dry and lacking in emotional appeal and funny references.

155
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:13,460
Like the first 20 minutes of this stream. And it's really pissing people up. Sandra also displays

156
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,700
a noted tendency to complete work rather than delegating at a trend unbecoming in upper management.

157
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,460
All in all, Sandra's work habits suggest a preoccupation with details and a startling

158
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,720
lack of vision. Needs improvement. Okay. Screenshot it. Screenshot it. Hack. Wait. What?

159
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:42,250
Accessing restricted file. Spoof login credentials. Ooh. Graham's understanding of product messaging

160
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,130
and branding is impressive, especially for a relatively low-level editor. Has a knock,

161
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:51,930
is a knack for memorable slogans and taglines. However, Graham has issues with brevity and

162
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:57,049
shows consistent disregard for prescribed fonts and formats. Some of his work has been flagged

163
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:04,099
for subversive under... What do I care? Just delete all their emails. Fuck it. I don't care.

164
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:15,109
Oh wait. That was... I was supposed to... I was supposed to do that. Force is...

165
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:28,740
Well, looks like we're going the black hat route because I just did the thing that the bad guy

166
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,059
just wanted me to do because I was too annoyed to go through the email so I just deleted them.

167
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:49,380
All right. Well, let's keep going. I'm getting in that room. I know you can hear me talking right

168
00:30:49,380 --> 00:31:28,519
now. I'm coming in that room. I'll be there real soon. 75. Fuck. I gotta go find the rat that ate

169
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,140
him. Seeing as you're trapped, you might as well answer me a few things. We don't... Fuck it. Let's

170
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:42,650
go get it. Uh, arms key. Mm-hmm. Right. It's in the... It's in the colossus's stomach.

171
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:52,630
Well, we're safe up here. That was so easy. How did I not be... Why did I say I couldn't do that?

172
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,289
That was simple. That was the easiest fucking enemy in the whole game.

173
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:04,009
Why did I think that that was scary? I was actually scared of the monster and it's

174
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:22,789
built into my character's DNA. I could have just got that like 15 minutes ago. God damn it.

175
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:32,140
I was... I'm going in. Hi.

176
00:32:47,539 --> 00:33:03,539
Uh, normally when you help someone, they give you something for the trouble.

177
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,980
With the trouble you caused me, you're dying here. Normally when you help somebody, you get something.

178
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,160
By being saved by me, you entered into a non-negotiable contract. You now owe me.

179
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,059
Give me something or I'm stuffing you back in here.

180
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:32,460
Agreed to be saved if I'd known that. All right, here.

181
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,569
Okay. Thank you. 600 bits. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Beat it. You sure you're okay? I don't care.

182
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:56,279
Beat it. Yes, sir. If Max were here, that would have ended a lot differently.

183
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:14,380
I learned this in prison! Max is... Oh, wait. Can we do this? Let's do this together. You go over here

184
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:21,900
and let's talk through the wall together. Whatever. Thing sucks. Let's go. All right,

185
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:34,579
I did it. All right, I have a criticism of the game. This whole game has... It's almost like I

186
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:38,980
just got out of a pool. You know, when you look at shit, when you get out of a like a chlorine

187
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:48,179
filled pool, they have the chlorine pool filter on this whole game. Uh, I have too much stuff.

188
00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:04,460
Security blade. Get rid of it. Break it down. Uh, side is cool. Uh, the Furman. What is that?

189
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:20,969
I need to look at this stuff. What am I at? 148. What's this dude talking about? I'm talking

190
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:29,239
about when you when you're in the pool for way too long and you have you have a ton of like wrinkly

191
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:37,909
ass skin and when you everything has like a haze that you can't get rid of for like 45 minutes.

192
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:54,469
Have you guys never been in a pool? What? What? You guys don't know the pool eyes?

193
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:01,989
You did no way. You guys have to know. You have to know this. I'm not going to get I'm not going

194
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:10,500
to get fucking fibbed on here. Wait, I have options. Let me see. Return the bolt to Sanjar.

195
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,619
Uh, Sanjar leads the MSI so I got to complete the bold quest and maybe he'll like me.

196
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:26,309
What are you talking about?

197
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:38,460
You know when you just when things have are so normal to you and you talk about how these

198
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,260
doing these normal ass things and a shitload of people tell you that that is not normal.

199
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,559
If you go into a pool with chlorine in it and you like are going underwater and you're like opening

200
00:36:49,559 --> 00:37:00,170
your eyes underwater you get the like haze around lights and what are you talking about? Don't do

201
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:07,269
that. That's not what? Why are you opening your eyes in a chlorine pool? No one opens their eyes

202
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:15,699
in the chlorine pool. What are you talking about? Don't open your eyes. You guys didn't used to try

203
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:21,539
to see really hard. You'd go underwater and you'd rip your eyes open and be like look around and I

204
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:27,829
want to be able to see underwater like Aquaman. You guys didn't do that? I know for a fact at

205
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:37,820
least half of you did. You touch your eyes you like eat oh please don't even give me this like

206
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,900
he's chlorine's getting in the in his blood. You get out of the pool and you like grab the

207
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,900
sandwich and you take a bite out of your ham and cheese sandwich by next to the pool with the

208
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,860
at the cooler with your mom. Well you didn't wash your hands did you? You got chlorine in your mouth

209
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:05,320
now. You're forever contaminated. Who eats with wet hands? I don't know 10 year olds. You guys were 10

210
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:17,099
once. You had a sobering effect. Sir please stop. Forgive me Celia. I couldn't help myself.

211
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:23,780
Anyway what can I do for you? Okay hold on this is important. Pay attention everybody.

212
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,619
Found your view on a terminal in the arms building. I need MSI to stop broadcasting your jamming

213
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:41,750
devil's peak station. Found the cartridge and deleted that data for you. Look at this smug look.

214
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:55,510
Hmm I found that cartridge and accidentally deleted that data for you.

215
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:01,500
Oh yes I'm going to be up all night with this. All those blanks waiting to be filled. Boxes

216
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,380
waiting to be ticked. Try to control yourself sir. Have you any idea how powerful this is?

217
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:18,550
Corporations have been toppled with less. Oh okay. How exactly is data cartridge going to help? You

218
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,710
made it sound like you were sending me after a weapon. I don't think this will fit in any

219
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:32,360
of my guns. See Celia he gets it. I told you he would. So you did sir. The world isn't changed

220
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,920
with guns and speeches much as Graham and his followers would like to think but rather with

221
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:48,920
meticulous documentation. Chlorine. Hey by the way all of you health nuts in the chat right now.

222
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:55,099
When was the last time you drank water? You know what they put in the water right Chlorine?

223
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:01,750
If you ever drink water out of the tap you're drinking Chlorine unless you got yourself a

224
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:14,340
Berkey unit then it clears it out. Use a filter. I do. I use a full Berkey water filtration system.

225
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:29,429
Pool water and tap water are the same.

226
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,809
You've ingested Chlorine in your life and you know you have.

227
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:45,449
And you're sitting there now going you're doing the cartoon like Bugs Bunny. You got your nails.

228
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:51,929
Both your hands are up in your mouth and you're like ear of corn on your nails going wait a minute

229
00:40:51,929 --> 00:41:05,940
he's right. Spare me the details of what comes next. Corporate espionage. How was that Celia?

230
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,389
Did I sell it? Fast delivery yet sir. Do you filter your shower water? No I don't shower.

231
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:25,860
Wait well you guys you guys shower in 2020. I just wait till it rains and then I go out there

232
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:35,380
with a bar of soap. That's a true natural way to bathe. It kind of spoils the effect if you

233
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,900
have to ask. Promise me that once I've helped you with this MSI will stop broadcasting.

234
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah you killed it. Celia? Already noted for your review sir. Go into the pool

235
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,329
with a bar of soap. Imagine if you were at like a community pool and you're just sitting there

236
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:02,789
like with like soap and you're all suds'd up. I'd be like I'm out of here. I'm not going in this pool.

237
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,869
What's what's the plan? I have reason to believe that one of the other corporations is operating

238
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:18,389
on Monarch illegally and in secret. Those bastards leave us to our perils then come back just to

239
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:25,190
reap what they can. If we can find proof I can use that as leverage to encourage certain powers

240
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:33,579
that be to accept our Bolt 52 and reinstate us on the board. Now what does that mean for me? If

241
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:38,780
someone is operating here then Catherine's almost certainly supplying them out of Fallbrook. Perhaps

242
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,340
she could be convinced to tell you where they are. I remember me and Kim one time went to a community

243
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:52,019
pool and we walked in and nobody was in the pool. We were like what's going on here? Why is nobody

244
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,659
in the pool? There was a bunch of people there. They're all sitting around the sides and we're

245
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:02,179
like this is all right cool we got like the we could just go in and Kim went to go in and she

246
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:09,269
put you know she got it maybe to her shins and there was one of the lifeguards get out out out

247
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:16,980
oh what's what's going on oh somebody threw up in the pool so they have to shock it it takes like

248
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:23,820
an hour before anyone can go back in and is it weird for me to say not only do I not want to

249
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:30,679
go in that pool but I never want to go in that pool ever again is that like somebody threw up

250
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:39,130
in that pool and it's just mixed in there forever you just don't just dump chemicals in it and then

251
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:45,449
I got me thinking how many times has this happened because they were very nonchalant about the whole

252
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:50,489
thing it was just like not not yeah no just an hour or so yeah take about an hour whatever

253
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:56,460
that happens like five times a day how many times has somebody thrown up in the community pool

254
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,579
or like shitting it or whatever I don't know I don't does that make me does it make me like

255
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:10,710
a weirdo if I'm not wanting to go in a community pool it's a shitload of chemicals a ton of

256
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:19,610
chemicals to counteract a ton of puke and pee and shit this probably maybe 40 percent actual

257
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:31,750
water in that pool the rest is like made of gel with all these chemicals and human pee 99

258
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:40,730
people pee in pools that's what I'm saying and then people well what about the ocean but the ocean

259
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:48,250
is huge I feel like diluted human pee in the ocean you know you're talking about like 30

260
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:54,409
decimal points to the right for a while what actual human pee is in the ocean that pool is

261
00:44:54,409 --> 00:45:07,510
a concentrated small area but as much as I love your can-do attitude and dangerous gravitas would

262
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:13,510
you rather have those chemicals or brown yellow water if you could leave her in one I don't know

263
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:22,889
what's worse how you people put it it's both they both suck what is he saying leave her in peace

264
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,510
what the fuck are you talking about of course I didn't mean to make assumptions

265
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:35,190
once you uh subtly work out whether centrist bring back proof of its operation maybe some nice

266
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,630
leather head you gotta pick you gotta pick pee somebody peeing in the pool versus chemicals in

267
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:55,800
the pool oh what a fucking centrist how about the pool is just normal I think now this would be

268
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,460
interesting if you had to sign a waiver before you got in the pool that said hey uh if I piss

269
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:12,409
shit or puke in this pool I have to give everybody else at the pool 20 bucks I yeah I probably sign

270
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:21,019
it because everybody has to get out of the pool and you like ruin everybody's day if you like

271
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:25,099
diarrhea in a pool you should have I mean come on like this should be a waiver you signed before you

for another 10 minutes remember when everybody was talking shit to me about peeing in the shower

294
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:48,260
every there's a lot of people in here that seem to think that peeing in their bathtub is is okay

295
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:55,340
but increase your bathtub size by a thousand percent and then let a bunch of other people

296
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:09,989
in your bathtub while you piss in it but that's okay so you so then you piss in the bathtub

297
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:14,840
and then invite all your friends over and say let's get in let's get in the pool

298
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:27,019
I got I got fucking people went and people went on me hard for the like pee in the shower bit

299
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:41,130
and a bunch of you could talk about how you pee in pools I cannot believe it peeing in the shower

300
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:50,789
is fine peeing in the bathtub is not correct why would you pee in the bathtub you're lying there

301
00:50:50,789 --> 00:51:01,159
just that would be disgusting wouldn't it because you're surrounded by it give me a break I piss in

the pool from the outside well I hope you got arrested because that's crazy listen listen to me

303
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:31,909
that's crazy right if you were to just piss into a pool from the outside like a giant urinal that

304
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:36,630
would be the most fucked up thing you could ever do in public in a scenario where you're at the

305
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:42,389
pool but why is it when you go under the water that it's now okay for you to do the same thing

306
00:51:47,769 --> 00:52:07,670
you're just getting caught in one of those scenarios because no one else sees it yeah that's

307
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:22,099
that's crazy all right time to reset reset we have he's just been listening to this the whole time

do you have evidence against UDL or not oh all right here you go I knew there was something

439
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:21,060
going on this is exactly the proof we need the board will have to welcome us back now

440
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:27,539
I'll transmit this data along with the completed bolt 52 right away cool sit back and quietly wait

441
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,140
MSI elite armor no more broadcast from us

01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:22,170
got this new cool handgun get it to 60 armor penetration is up and then let's do a little

447
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:46,100
bit more into hacking lockpicking yeah new perk okay uh carrying capacity dialogue skills

448
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:56,340
interactable highlight range what's that mean consumable weight consumable okay shut up

449
01:16:56,899 --> 01:17:09,930
50 less weight okay uh what do I want to do fast travel wow no that's stupid you just this perk

450
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:14,890
is I think the that just should delete it and replace it with anything else it's so easy just

451
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:19,319
to break down anything to just be able to fast travel and sell everything why would you ever

452
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:35,739
use this this is 100 useless turn off the face cam not staying on uh science weapon this is not

453
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,630
this is not bad six bit movement penalty to accuracy that's not that's pretty good too

454
01:17:50,279 --> 01:18:01,100
I'll do this one all right you guys have points too tier three companion ability damage

455
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:08,060

495
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:31,270
stop using devil's peak let's get right out to it and just jump right on the issue at hand

496
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:38,699
stop no spreading the truth is the only way to combat the board's poisonous campaign of

497
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:44,310
propaganda against their people your broadcasts aren't working nobody's listening

498
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:48,550
you know the board is going to let its citizens listen to your propaganda

499
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:53,750
and nobody's listening to your broadcasts I realize the board has blockaded our efforts but

500
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:58,789
devil's peak is an interplanetary radio tower surely somebody is listening

501
01:25:59,829 --> 01:26:08,100
no surely sorry uh you're only transmitting on a single radio frequency and very few people

502
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:14,340
can actually receive it this is not even a lie this is a science I'm just telling this guy the

503
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:22,260
truth gram we should be focusing on survival anyway food ammo and medicine maybe now is the

504
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:31,289
time to pivot pivot if radio isn't working we might try another way it seems the captain's

505
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:37,130
time let me try another way serendipitous it must be fate I've had my sights on an old printing

506
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:42,409
press for some time the board uses magazines and advertisements to subtly focus the colony's

507
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:50,970
is to use app no those are all things you should not ever be doing that's all terrible advice

508
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:59,270
don't do that bucket of a radio tower hey here's how you get his attention do all these things that

509
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:10,149
like you shouldn't be doing and do them all in a row what no don't do those things help me clear

510
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:18,710
out and repair the press and I'll have no need for that rust bucket of a tower um that's too

511
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:25,159
much work I'll just kill you now and be done with it if you want to get his attention just

512
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:30,600
use the fish emoji that's that's cool that's pretty true that's pretty close hold on you're

513
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,239
saying you want to print propaganda in their magazines actually have better reach people read

514
01:27:35,239 --> 01:27:41,590
that stuff all over the system even in Byzantium you see citizens of halcyon are glued to their

515
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:47,989
periodicals even I find myself occasionally distracted by their fish propaganda quality

516
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:53,430
of editing and unacceptable disregard for grammatical structure my literary prowess

517
01:27:53,430 --> 01:28:00,470
will hook them and the eternal truth will reel them in what's into me I'm starting to sound like

705
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:15,500
being let us cease our activities on the tower lest we bring premature attention upon us

706
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:21,739
I have much to do articles to write sermons to ponder we live in such an exciting time

707

726
02:09:48,170 --> 02:10:01,029
front door don't be a fool it's the blessed sound of radio silence which leads me to believe you

727
02:10:01,029 --> 02:10:09,270
have sweet sweet news for me I do MSI and the iconoclast are no longer transmitting is the data

728
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:18,149
ready yes indeed I am back in business but before we get down to it might I ask how you handled

729
02:10:18,149 --> 02:10:24,470
the problem none of your business does it matter job's done thank you I couldn't have said it better

730
02:10:24,470 --> 02:10:31,930
myself I hope to both MSI and the iconoclast get what they wanted you're an information broker if

731
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:38,729
I want if you want to know it'll cost you oh I believe it will the price I pay won't be to you

732
02:10:38,729 --> 02:10:44,380
no we've a bigger deal to settle I don't doubt that you are working with Phineas but my contract

733
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:49,180
specifies I relay any acquired information to the purchaser and to the purchaser alone

734
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:55,180
however if you send the data I will need your assistance in cycling the antennas

735
02:10:55,180 --> 02:11:03,899
everyone always needs you to do something like okay how do you hook up with you

736
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:08,699
tell me how to fix it and I bet I have a whole new checklist of crap to do before it works right

737
02:11:09,579 --> 02:11:15,180
do it yourself first I never leave the tower no exceptions well you will be in a body bag

738
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:20,220
in about 10 minutes you don't do here to key in the sequence to the tower system when it resets

739
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:25,659
or the calibration will fail normally I'd beg Neoka to do the honors but it appears she's

740
02:11:25,659 --> 02:11:31,340
following your lead now it's simple truly I merely need you to waltz outside and throw

741
02:11:31,340 --> 02:11:36,300
the lever to cycle the power I'll key in the numerical adjustments if that is not what I

742
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:51,460
have to do if that's not it then this guy's gonna die just press the lever outside that's it someone

743
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:57,699
has trust issues though I can't hardly feign surprise yes that is all no I am not mocking you

744
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:05,770
much just step outside lock the door on me the switch depart forever understood good marvelous

745
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:10,170
we're in agreement this is why I stopped helping out I'm gonna close the door and lock it it's

746
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:15,210
always throw this lever shoot that marauder save my life just one thing after another with you

747
02:12:20,569 --> 02:12:29,430
don't burst a blood vessel I'll give whatever terrific I'll be here waiting with bated breath

748
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:37,899
give a shout if the panel electrocutes you it's hard to not do it all right just press the button

749
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:47,479
you don't know that I have time travel mechanics see right now I just put a time travel spot right

750
02:12:47,479 --> 02:12:52,199
here because if you close the door and lock it on me I'm just gonna time travel back and kill you

751
02:12:58,789 --> 02:13:05,319
all right let's see what happens here that's cheating that's not cheating that's holding

752
02:13:05,319 --> 02:13:08,680
your hand in the choose your own adventure book with your finger in between the pages

753
02:13:09,319 --> 02:13:27,560
testing one check check but that's it I was gonna start saying all kinds of

754
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:42,260
fucked up stuff oh and I also dispatched Vinny as his data it'll make me come back in there

755
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:47,880
there's no need to assert your dominance I doubt I could make you do anything you don't wish

756
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:53,399
look I am well aware that at times I may have the tiniest iota of a prickly exterior

757
02:13:53,399 --> 02:14:01,590
but I must admit I have grown rather fond of you as Neoka can attest I do not form attachments

758
02:14:02,949 --> 02:14:08,149
do take care why he told us to leave without flinging insults at our purses

759
02:14:08,710 --> 02:14:18,739
he really does like you captain well I don't like him we blasted hell is that told you no

760
02:14:18,739 --> 02:14:36,819
somebody just like somebody just crashed what was that whose ship was that

761
02:14:37,699 --> 02:14:49,079
it's one of the board's blockade oh whatever oh maybe they'll be all right I agree

762
02:14:49,079 --> 02:15:01,560
they're like invading each other's channels

763
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:18,600
10 over here 10 over here 10 over here everybody gets some time on the radio

764
02:15:18,600 --> 02:15:22,100
you can't hog the game oh it's a reunion

765
02:15:43,029 --> 02:15:46,039
uh you're acting like children

766
02:15:46,439 --> 02:15:57,560
half of the course really while you still could use its targeting module

767
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:59,399
imagine turning on the radio and hearing this

768
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:32,729
private channel guys can I say something over the internet broadcast we did it I did it see

769
02:16:32,729 --> 02:16:51,659
where the ship looks I don't care captain hi return time is within 14 percent of the expected

770
02:16:52,139 --> 02:16:53,180
I want to talk to Phineas

771
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:09,350
it's the first time I've been here too this is new area new content

772
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:15,450
all right let's go back to the original dentist crew

773
02:17:27,129 --> 02:17:35,959
hello can you hear me does this work damn it blasted I'm just securing my ongoing experiments

774
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:40,700
get off the radio you're on the same wavelength

775
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:49,049
visitors since in fact I've never had a visitor I have now

776
02:17:54,469 --> 02:17:57,909
shrink ray science weapons are unique weapons that have strange and powerful

777
02:17:57,909 --> 02:18:01,750
effects science weapon damage and the strength of their effects both increases your science skill

778
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:28,629
increases did they get a funny voice that's all I care about max you know what to do

779
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:38,920
remind the wall of bulletproof glass I don't know how you did it

780
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:46,200
but Hiram Blythe just sent me everything I needed nice I did it according to Hiram's message

781
02:18:46,200 --> 02:19:02,700
minister Clark has ordered a suspended time of scarcity once I have those chemicals we can

782
02:19:02,700 --> 02:19:10,139
revive the hopes colonists and put some decent people in charge so good news you're going to

783
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:20,020
seriously those chemicals exciting okay what's so important about these chemicals

784
02:19:20,899 --> 02:19:38,059
that is the reason you're essential to reviving the hopes colonists okay I need you to steal as

785
02:19:38,059 --> 02:19:50,020
much as you possibly can imagine getting along better will stop the board from destroying this

786
02:19:50,020 --> 02:19:58,600
colony all right so what's the plan ah yes the detail I'm not about to ask you to rampage

787
02:19:58,600 --> 02:20:03,620
through presenting bullets with the board's agents we'll have to resort to subterfuge

788
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:33,670
thankfully I don't have to drop ten thousand dollars to get it find Carmen

789
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:57,500
steel chemicals got it you're lucky you behind the glass tested if it's bulletproof

790
02:20:58,790 --> 02:21:03,860
I know it's bulletproof turn the shrink ray on yourself

791
02:21:04,500 --> 02:21:13,979
you can't do that I will try it though I mean it's like a funny laugh out loud weapon right

792
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:33,979
how many what is it 1300 ammo yes there what happened

793
02:21:40,729 --> 02:21:41,850
what is going on

794
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:56,489
stop stop it

795
02:22:13,290 --> 02:22:21,719
no I don't I'm about to walk by a companion quest no I don't fine since when Byzantium there's

796
02:22:21,719 --> 02:22:27,719
something I've been meaning to do no we're not doing it anything else

797
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:41,350
you know I'm in a bad mood today you got in my way and you're trying to talk to me

798
02:22:41,350 --> 02:23:01,989
really I think we I think I think we should part ways let's go never mind dentists this is

799
02:23:01,989 --> 02:23:06,149
further than I got in the game good night well see you later hope you have fun with the rest of the

800
02:23:06,149 --> 02:23:16,200
game massive spoiler coming up this is the part of the game when Phineas actually rips off a

801
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:24,229
rubber mask and he's the bad guy the whole time hey Carmen do you mind I'm needing someone

802
02:23:24,950 --> 02:23:33,979
I'm sorry we're gonna have to part ways uh what a coincidence me too I oh oh you mean I'm supposed

803
02:23:33,979 --> 02:23:40,889
to be meeting you all right let's keep this moving yeah you're looking to make contact with minister

804
02:23:42,170 --> 02:23:49,209
magpie right I guess it won't be easy he spends most of his time in this estate which is heavily

805
02:23:49,209 --> 02:23:55,219
guarded so has it got to be a way to catch the minister someplace less protected can you get me

806
02:23:55,219 --> 02:23:59,059
into the minister's estate how exactly did you get involved in all this there's got to be a way

807
02:23:59,059 --> 02:24:03,700
to catch him somewhere afraid not he almost never leaves his home and his guards never leave him

808
02:24:04,659 --> 02:24:11,510
can you get me in there whoa I'm not one of your bne specialists I just provide intelligence

809
02:24:14,899 --> 02:24:27,579
vulgar eater birds are kind of my specialty code names too but I can give you some information

810
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:32,299
some of the guards hang around Billingsley's house of inebriation between shifts

811
02:24:32,299 --> 02:24:36,540
okay so they get drunk maybe you could do some reconnaissance there you know swipe a key while

812
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:44,790
nobody's looking a booger and a booger and eating specialist thanks for the tip just remember you

813
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:56,120
didn't hear it from me okay it's just me is there everything and everything feel big out here

814
02:24:57,399 --> 02:25:11,979
you don't feel this I didn't even do anything I just made you small for a second I mean that

815
02:25:11,979 --> 02:25:27,190
would have probably hurt a lot it would have like crushed all your bones then why does it not last

816

on the secret working so tell me not your cuckoo long elevator ride something exciting happened

824
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:46,260

839
02:29:41,510 --> 02:30:06,649
let's go FPS city all cleaning jobs have been in FPS city be a fool I'd have to request a

840
02:30:06,649 --> 02:30:13,209
counter waiver and you know how dreadful the paperwork is don't I ever my dear fellow why

841
02:30:13,209 --> 02:30:18,569
I spent three hours filing a discussion authorization just to commence our little

842
02:30:19,049 --> 02:30:32,899
test how we suffer in the name of commerce no I don't know what accent this is but it's in every

843
02:30:32,899 --> 02:30:42,459
single thing that is referencing older potentially wealthy people what is that accent oh my dear boy

844
02:30:42,459 --> 02:30:49,020
this is not English or American it's something strange in between it's as if you took a record

845
02:30:49,020 --> 02:31:06,100
and held your finger on it while you try to play it back normally it's the monopoly man accent

846
02:31:09,180 --> 02:31:20,299
that's a warped there's a warped record it's about that accent is the mid-atlantic accent

847
02:31:20,299 --> 02:31:25,100
it's a cultivated accent of English blending together prestigious American and British English

848
02:31:25,819 --> 02:31:30,540
ways of speaking adopted in the early 20th century by mostly by American aristocrats and actors

849
02:31:30,540 --> 02:31:38,180
there's not native vernacular or regional American accent wait they were doing that on purpose

850
02:31:42,969 --> 02:32:01,540
that's a fake accent really it was Americans larping as British

851
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:12,280
so that was just Americans doing a poor bad British accent role-playing

852
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:26,620
wow all right let's go time for my audition British people do it too what why do British

to enemies within 2.5 meters damn you can attack after killing an enemy your next attack that's

859
02:34:10,200 --> 02:34:15,780

1000
03:02:58,360 --> 03:03:06,280
drugs you should try a vending machine or a purveyor of curative goods what is this system

1001
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:12,920
coming to when even the earth minister is disillusioned beyond hope will that be all

1002
03:03:12,920 --> 03:03:19,479
there why do you keep talking like that they're getting denser by the day

1003
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:32,760
I shall endeavor to speak more slowly is this better slower and louder into my good ear what

1004
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:40,340
was that a joke sarcasm even oh this is such a relief you've no idea how long it's been since

1005
03:03:40,340 --> 03:03:47,020
I spoke with someone intelligent enough for irony great so how about you tell me about those

1006
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:54,340
chemicals this again I really don't know about any chemicals process of elimination the only other

1007
03:03:54,340 --> 03:04:02,340
person with access of course of course it's Rockwell again who else and I thought he was

1008
03:04:02,340 --> 03:04:10,389
only holding me here to keep me out of the way what I mean you're locked up here you are a quick

1009
03:04:10,389 --> 03:04:17,100
study indeed I've long suspected Rockwell of transacting business in my name but this proves

1010
03:04:17,100 --> 03:04:22,379
it he's attempting to game the system but he won't be able to get away with it forever

1011
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:29,739
eventually Rockwell's house of cards will topple I dearly hope so and you might be part of the

1012
03:04:29,739 --> 03:04:37,979
equation okay one dart you hear Rockwell through the window just into his neck

1013
03:04:39,860 --> 03:04:45,780
and that fucking syringe is full of salicylic acid it'll kill him less than five minutes

1014
03:04:46,579 --> 03:04:53,190
why would he go through all this trouble should I know I've been under house arrest for years

1015
03:04:54,069 --> 03:05:00,360
but there is a way to find out and perhaps to set things right whatever Rockwell's doing

1016
03:05:00,360 --> 03:05:06,120
he'll be doing it from the HHC headquarters your best lead is to look for details in his office

1017
03:05:07,370 --> 03:05:12,090
captain we must investigate Rockwell an injustice like this cannot go unchecked

1018
03:05:12,729 --> 03:05:20,409
I trust max it cannot I can't trust the urgency of the matter if it's dirty it's a job for Sam

1019
03:05:21,049 --> 03:05:28,180
it's filthy indeed my mechanical friend rife with the worst sort of corruption why this is

1020
03:05:28,180 --> 03:05:38,329
starting to sound like an issue of dissident hunter we're discussing you're too excited

1021
03:05:38,329 --> 03:05:45,530
espionage legal redress a possible salvation of halcyon is this not exhilarating

1022
03:05:46,889 --> 03:05:51,129
also this is the longest conversation I've had with someone else in quite some time

1023
03:05:53,059 --> 03:05:59,979
uh if you're the best we have to offer we're screwed I assure you I didn't ask to be locked

1024
03:05:59,979 --> 03:06:06,459
up and made to perform like a trained animal but I'm attempting to make the best of an opportunity

1025
03:06:06,459 --> 03:06:12,860
I only hope you can do the same now we've got to get into the HHC that's in the Acropolis district

1026
03:06:12,860 --> 03:06:18,360
along with the other major corporate and government facilities but only board employees

1027
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:23,719
corporations government government corporation guarded checkpoint just down the street the board

1028
03:06:23,719 --> 03:06:28,680
there might be a route through the maintenance tunnels but I'm afraid I don't know specifics

1029
03:06:28,680 --> 03:06:37,260
most people avoid the area for obvious reasons a few guards don't scare me that's good because

1030
03:06:37,260 --> 03:06:43,100
there are sure to be more at headquarters when you reach the HHC building this access card should

1031
03:06:43,100 --> 03:06:47,579
get you up to the executive suites where the chairman's office and what used to be my office

1032
03:06:47,579 --> 03:06:56,540
are how did you hold on to your access car keys are none too bright I simply claimed I'd lost it

1033
03:06:56,540 --> 03:07:02,120
and hid it somewhere no one would think to look government corporations corporate government

1034
03:07:04,409 --> 03:07:10,250
all right I should get going wait rockwell has one of the only terminals capable of transmitting

1035

1036
03:07:17,049 --> 03:07:22,889
his office rockwell hasn't given me any messages from earth for years he's desperate to keep me

1037
03:07:22,889 --> 03:07:27,370
out of contact with the earth directorate but they need to know what's happening here

1038
03:07:30,299 --> 03:07:35,180
all right you can count on me is in dire need of someone like you

1039
03:07:40,920 --> 03:07:48,149

1043
03:09:04,860 --> 03:09:13,899
that's freaking me out how do you read that book that's a magician's book yeah there's like

1044
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:30,760
look at all this weird stuff here all right so get access to this person's office and

1045
03:09:30,760 --> 03:09:48,200
yell at them and scream at them down there the chairman's office pizza is the shape of

1046
03:09:48,200 --> 03:10:03,379
a triangle so press triangle if it were only that easy oh there right there can't you just

1047
03:10:03,459 --> 03:10:09,670
see the stench of impropriety radiating off of him for the last time access to

1048
03:10:09,670 --> 03:10:16,819
besant him is impossible without a proper analogy now if you'll excuse me i need to be

1049
03:10:18,260 --> 03:10:31,260
somewhere else how much have you ever lost on a coin toss how about i don't understand it's a

1050
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:43,899
simple question how much i don't know maybe i can't reckon i'd say you can sir how splendid

1051
03:10:43,899 --> 03:10:49,420
another rung leech wandering through the streets of besantium why just this morning i thought to

1052
03:10:49,420 --> 03:10:54,540
myself as lovely as the gardens are what they really need is more greasy vagrants

1053
03:10:54,540 --> 03:11:06,090
frolicking through them and here you are frolicking gracefully might i add what a

1054
03:11:06,090 --> 03:11:09,290
coincidence just now i thought i'd really like to sock this lady in the face

1055
03:11:15,799 --> 03:11:21,559
how utterly expected you must be one of those violent vagrants i've heard tell of wandering

1056
03:11:21,559 --> 03:11:26,600
the system in search of brutality honestly what is the board thinking letting so many of your

1057
03:11:26,600 --> 03:11:36,870
ilk into the city proper it's madness if the board isn't supposed to let people into the city how did

1058
03:11:36,870 --> 03:11:43,430
you get here i earned my place here just like everyone else my grandfather was the cio at tile

1059
03:11:43,430 --> 03:11:52,979
you see cio chief idea officer he came up with all the best ideas for their products you know

1060
03:11:52,979 --> 03:11:57,780
the font they use for stogie slits that was him so you mean the guy that showed up to work

1061
03:11:57,780 --> 03:12:05,700
once a month their font development team in socks and sandals a blazer it was a very long list

1062
03:12:09,500 --> 03:12:15,340
oh what did he come up with let's see he picked the colors they included in rainbow chips no one

1063
03:12:15,340 --> 03:12:22,059
else wanted purple but he insisted everyone loves the purple ones and you know how the cosmic smokes

1064
03:12:22,059 --> 03:12:26,780
logo has an eye in the middle of a heptagon he said that one came to him in a dream

1065
03:12:27,979 --> 03:12:31,899
he was a true visionary so far ahead of his time

1066
03:12:34,950 --> 03:12:40,309
wait but what did you do i just told you my grandfather made millions of bits as cio

1067
03:12:40,309 --> 03:12:58,420
and i earned them from him so you came into it you married into it of course it is wealth is

1068
03:12:58,420 --> 03:13:04,340
the most visible objective measure of success and success isn't given to you it's earned my

1069
03:13:04,340 --> 03:13:09,459
grandfather taught me that if you have wealth you're successful and if you're successful you

1070
03:13:09,459 --> 03:13:14,579
must have earned it what time do you close it's a simple concept no what time what time do you close

1071
03:13:17,370 --> 03:13:20,729
i had darker darkness not the time what time do you close

1072
03:13:26,489 --> 03:13:31,610
you're welcome now do we have any further business or are you just here for the repartee

1073
03:13:34,920 --> 03:13:39,559
what's wrong with people what's wrong with you it erodes the very pillars of our society

1074
03:13:39,559 --> 03:13:48,040
merit decorum personal hygiene this city is meant for us the system's finest we earned its luxuries

1075
03:13:48,760 --> 03:13:53,959
but now we are overrun with the unworthy and the ungrateful and this early retirement nonsense is

1076
03:13:53,959 --> 03:14:00,040
making it even worse and that's terrible attitude you shouldn't look down on people like that

1077
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:05,750
early retirement what are you talking about the worst thing to happen to halcyon

1078
03:14:05,750 --> 03:14:11,350
a contest that gives even the lowliest to most inefficient workers a chance to live in Byzantium

1079
03:14:11,989 --> 03:14:17,270
by simply winning a lottery those early retirees get an exclusive district of Byzantium to

1080
03:14:17,270 --> 03:14:28,649
themselves no one else is even allowed to go there tell me how is that fair life's not fair

1081
03:14:28,729 --> 03:14:35,129
well it should be if you pay enough it's not right i deserve to see any district i please

1082
03:14:35,690 --> 03:14:42,250
why if it weren't guarded i'd hmm you know you look like you've been shot at before

1083
03:14:42,250 --> 03:14:48,969
what say i hire you to investigate this travesty you want to hire me to do so oh we get paid this

1084
03:14:48,969 --> 03:14:58,329
time i like this plan yes listen to your your friend what is that person doesn't seem like you

1085
03:14:58,329 --> 03:15:03,049
have very many are they your secretary personal masseuse or do you just keep them around as a

1086
03:15:03,049 --> 03:15:08,969
mobile armrest well it doesn't matter what's important is that you think this is a fabulous

1087
03:15:08,969 --> 03:15:17,620
arrangement and you'd be thrilled to lend me your services aren't you why would i ever help you

1088
03:15:17,620 --> 03:15:21,299
with something like this did you miss the part where i said i'd pay you that's all the reasons

1089
03:15:21,299 --> 03:15:29,930
someone like you should require i mean it's not i like money but give me something better than that

1090
03:15:29,930 --> 03:15:38,069
better than money let's see there's no the thrill of discovery like in an aetherwave adventure

1091
03:15:38,069 --> 03:15:42,469
people love those right don't you want to see what the retirement district is like

1092
03:15:47,260 --> 03:15:56,250
fine i'll do it but not for the money fantastic consider yourself employed vagrant i hear the

1093
03:15:56,250 --> 03:16:01,209
chosen retirees all enter the retirement district via the port landing pad but it's completely

1094
03:16:01,209 --> 03:16:07,129
locked down you'd never get in that way unless of course you had a wealthy beautiful benefactor

1095
03:16:07,129 --> 03:16:12,090
of impeccable social pedigree which you do not i'm not gonna let her not gonna let her have that

1096
03:16:12,090 --> 03:16:16,170
over me guys these codes will get you past the lockdown you'll encounter security afterward

1097
03:16:16,170 --> 03:16:19,930
that's her power that's what her power comes that's what that's where her power comes from

1098
03:16:21,370 --> 03:16:28,020
how did you get these access the same way anyone gets anything here of course i made friends with

1099
03:16:28,020 --> 03:16:33,139
the right people bits might earn you a place in Byzantium but that means everyone here has

1100
03:16:33,139 --> 03:16:37,860
little need for more of them you're being paid with exposure like this you need to spend

1101
03:16:39,139 --> 03:16:46,500
let's call it social capital social capital that yeah that actually is paying with exposure

1102
03:16:48,739 --> 03:17:21,690

1296
04:00:33,299 --> 04:00:42,659
experiment i could go on he was made to me wells is a dangerous man you're going to endanger

1297
04:00:42,659 --> 04:00:47,540
everyone in health yarn he's an obsessive psychopath he stole a bunch of chemicals

1298
04:00:47,540 --> 04:00:54,979
so now you're in contact with wells i want you to send us a tracing signal from his communication

1299
04:00:54,979 --> 04:01:05,500
terminal cut her off aida thanks can you believe the nerve on that psychopath you know i can still

1300
04:01:05,500 --> 04:01:12,920
hear you right adjutant akande's call has been terminated will there be anything else captain

1301
04:01:14,620 --> 04:01:20,219
uh let's get the fuck out of trace that call and send a virus to your computer please

1302
04:01:33,579 --> 04:01:38,299
if you don't mind my saying captain minister clark is lucky to have you on his side

1303
04:01:42,020 --> 04:02:07,659
don't go rogue on me now i can't i'm afraid of sam all right what densest are we bringing

1304
04:02:10,469 --> 04:02:30,309
i need sam i don't need sam your entire ship is a robot i've got chemicals i've got chemicals

1305
04:02:31,190 --> 04:02:34,629
doctor i've got chemicals i'm bringing them to you i've got them here they are

1306
04:02:35,350 --> 04:02:55,500
install them breathe them experiment on them hey good forget about the chemicals for a second

1307
04:02:55,500 --> 04:02:58,459
the colonies on the verge of collapse i found your chemicals in the ministry the board was

1308
04:02:58,459 --> 04:03:13,850
testing them on human subjects uh i had to let the test subjects die but i brought back

1309
04:03:13,850 --> 04:03:17,290
all the chemicals i put them out of their misery here's your canister of chemicals by the way

1310
04:03:18,090 --> 04:03:27,819
these are both awful um you've brought me enough chemicals to get started at least

1311
04:03:27,899 --> 04:03:38,540
but all of them i'm just sorry they came at the cost of human life to accomplish

1312
04:03:40,100 --> 04:03:44,659
um something about repeatedly melting frozen people there are a lot of big words you know

1313
04:03:44,659 --> 04:04:22,920
how food goes stale if you freeze it too much like that but with people dumb science 40 uh the

1314
04:04:22,920 --> 04:04:36,500
colonies on the verge of collapse the board's been trying to cover it up i know i'm suspect

1315
04:04:36,500 --> 04:04:40,979
what do we do the board's mismanagement put our colony on the road to collapse if we don't put

1316
04:04:41,059 --> 04:04:48,620
a stop to them some of colonists are going to die what do we what do we do it gets worse the

1317
04:04:48,620 --> 04:04:56,299
chairman's planning on freezing every worker in halcyon it's pretty fucked up

1318
04:04:59,020 --> 04:05:05,799
yep and the chairman's plan to save all of us yeah i always knew halcyon was heading

1319
04:05:05,799 --> 04:05:12,229
toward this cause for let's just let's go to chili's and order everything off the menu might as well

1320
04:05:21,500 --> 04:05:36,459
then i'll stop it the board's going to kill them all we need to think about this there has to be

1321
04:05:36,459 --> 04:05:39,180
something we can do that's it we just give up all the trouble went through for another

1322
04:05:39,180 --> 04:05:42,540
this colony's a mess i'll be glad to put it behind me as soon as i get a chance whoa

1323
04:05:43,340 --> 04:06:12,489
we got to be something we can do let's go cut them off we need to get to those colonists

1324
04:06:20,360 --> 04:06:23,399
would have been a lot easier if you just set up your lab next to the hope

1325
04:06:28,280 --> 04:06:45,000
yeah i like it just wait until you hear the details i haven't been this energized since

1326
04:06:45,000 --> 04:07:00,809
the time i injected myself with raw cap and all if we skip the entire third act of the game

1327
04:07:00,809 --> 04:07:05,610
and that's going to work and get to the yelling us in the process i thought interest system

1328
04:07:05,610 --> 04:07:22,579
micro jumps were prohibited for a reason experimental methods for killing noxious

1329
04:07:22,579 --> 04:07:27,299
life forms are not covered under this unit's limited liability agreement

1330
04:07:27,860 --> 04:07:34,819
well said whatever you are hey you'll need to switch auxiliary power using the unreliable

1331
04:07:34,819 --> 04:07:54,739
then head to the bridge i can't wait for the germa rumble 2019 or 20

1332
04:07:55,620 --> 04:08:02,299
when it's the dentist versus somebody else in the tag match interesting i think let's do it

1333
04:08:02,299 --> 04:08:07,399
i know you're wondering why i'm doing all this the people on the hope are the answer to the

1334
04:08:07,399 --> 04:08:38,360
cost problems hope is carrying some of humanity okay by the way why are you hiding behind bullet

1335
04:08:38,360 --> 04:08:45,850
proof glass it took me this long what being frozen into your brain that is bullshit that's

1336
04:08:45,850 --> 04:08:51,450
why i don't desire to end up like that's an absolute that's regardless it's quite comfortable

1337
04:08:51,450 --> 04:09:01,100
you know i have my beans have my caffeinoids plenty of toilet paper all right level 20 i

1338
04:09:01,100 --> 04:09:12,309
thought this was a big brain oh what's wrong with me all right i'm standing next to something i'm

1339
04:09:12,309 --> 04:09:26,309
terrified of 12 13 to 9 26 okay you gotta go you gotta go you're out of here i'm sorry i need a new

1340
04:09:26,309 --> 04:09:47,930
dentist let's just make it work let's get to like a hundred like 80 reduce damage from area

1341
04:09:47,930 --> 04:10:02,549
thickened plasma more carrying capacity this one's not terrible more damage with low health that's

1342
04:10:02,549 --> 04:10:21,340
pretty good yeah i'll do it and you show time damage plus 25 increases the damage dealt by

1343
04:10:21,340 --> 04:10:39,129
this companion after performing show time yeah sam it's been fun see you later goodbye you can

1344
04:10:39,129 --> 04:10:58,090
stay on the ship and there's a pig over here oh wow it's an omega pig i don't think those things

1345
04:10:58,090 --> 04:11:07,100
existed all right let's go let's let's do it let's actually do this let's let's do this

1346
04:11:07,659 --> 04:11:31,299
let's go for it keep sam no sam scares me hope talking i hope dr wells has not

1347
04:11:31,299 --> 04:11:37,299
dragged you into one of his irrational schemes again my diagnosis of his mental stability is

1348
04:11:38,020 --> 04:11:48,469
not flattering you want to be ceo hope let's go to the hope

1349
04:11:52,489 --> 04:11:58,010
we have arrived at the hope i need you to reroute power from our ship to the hopes auxiliary

1350
04:11:58,010 --> 04:12:03,450
generator you'll have to connect me to the hopes comm system so i can convince her central computer

1351
04:12:03,450 --> 04:12:09,500
to enable the skip drive we're gonna get a robot fight an ai fight what's gonna happen if i skip

1352
04:12:09,500 --> 04:12:15,100
the hope your calculations are even slightly off you could crash the entire colony ship into terra

1353
04:12:15,100 --> 04:12:21,049
two for the sun oh good thing i'm great at math i know all the best numbers

1354
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:26,409
i must recommend you leave the calculations up to me captain there's so many numbers so

1355
04:12:26,409 --> 04:12:32,309
many big numbers you have the best numbers in brackets trump

1356
04:12:37,500 --> 04:12:43,209
all right that's all for now well talk to that computer and let us know how it goes

1357
04:12:52,469 --> 04:13:14,700
i like your special move breathe down my neck why don't you okay hope power hope comes

1358
04:13:23,000 --> 04:13:32,489
packs yeah power is now being ruled from the docking bay patch ada into the hopes communication

1359
04:13:32,489 --> 04:13:45,350
system status power cool maintenance looks good hibernation storage seems all right logs cool

1360
04:13:49,579 --> 04:13:58,620
ship puts me on edge captain you know what you're doing i don't who are you i hear someone snuck

1361
04:13:58,620 --> 04:14:14,069
into the repository who the hell is this all right coms oh we have to talk to oh quincy duncan you

1362
04:14:14,069 --> 04:14:19,750
know when they posted us here i told him there wasn't any point nobody would be so stupid as

1363
04:14:19,750 --> 04:14:26,409
to fly to the ass end of the colony for this derelict shows how much i know you've got about

1364
04:14:26,409 --> 04:14:30,250
five seconds to tell me what you're doing here before i make you take a walk outside

1365
04:14:33,139 --> 04:14:37,979
uh i was sent to repair the reactor so it doesn't explode and take out the colony

1366
04:14:39,020 --> 04:14:42,780
they sent me to extract a few samples from your uh frozen cargo it's gross

1367
04:14:43,659 --> 04:14:53,049
an engineer life explode holy shit all right you'll want a uniform so my staff doesn't shoot you on

1368
04:14:53,850 --> 04:14:58,969
they're dangerous it makes a board and trigger happy we've got a few extra in the old badge

1375
04:16:26,170 --> 04:16:36,549

1379
04:17:01,620 --> 04:17:14,540
for you you don't have two handed guns keep the tactical shotgun you use the flamethrower

1380
04:17:14,540 --> 04:17:34,920
where'd it go and the stun baton now we're ready let's do uh harmful status effects all right

1381
04:17:40,229 --> 04:17:46,809

1384
04:18:01,100 --> 04:18:51,659
guys excuse me i'm almost out of juice out of juice i can't lie to a robot robot communications

1385
04:19:01,420 --> 04:19:07,979
wait wait it wants to talk to me it wanted it said it wanted to talk to me it said it wanted to talk

1386
04:19:08,780 --> 04:19:16,229

1387
04:19:20,200 --> 04:19:45,690
i took too long what oh i i i no i didn't say i i i i said i i i

1388
04:20:06,620 --> 04:20:12,379
can you hear me captain i have successfully integrated myself into the hopes con systems

1389
04:20:12,379 --> 04:20:19,270
and i'm attempting to establish contact with the hopes more primitive processor now would you

1390
04:20:19,270 --> 04:20:25,909
like me to play a mood suitable music selection while you travel to the bridge oh sorry file not

1391
04:20:25,909 --> 04:20:35,260
found i'm currently trying to not get spotted by these monsters i need some i need okay i need to

1392
04:20:35,260 --> 04:21:11,100
talk to somebody i need somebody to see me that's not a robot well that was a good little skip

1393
04:21:18,440 --> 04:21:41,030
wait can i is this correct is taking me home i think so oh there we go have a nice day

1394
04:21:41,030 --> 04:21:52,120
okay that's the hopes computer up ahead i'll admit i am curious to wake him i hope you guys

1395
04:21:53,750 --> 04:22:00,790
work it out patch ada through i am speaking to you through the hopes computer system

1396
04:22:00,790 --> 04:22:10,860
it's a rather cramped feeling but it'll do i'm ready to skip hope tell me am i really doing

1397
04:22:10,860 --> 04:22:17,420
the right thing i don't want no i'm ready to skip hope are you sure that is extremely dangerous

1398
04:22:17,899 --> 04:22:24,440
skipping the hope will void the warranty on the skip drive and also potentially kill an entire

1399
04:22:24,440 --> 04:22:35,159
planet how is my humor now captain improved skip jump starting the skip drive destination set to

1400
04:22:35,159 --> 04:22:47,209
the rings of terra 2 jumping destination okay do it if we're meant to make it we will no use worrying

1401
04:22:47,209 --> 04:22:57,209
otherwise doing it i mean affirmative skipping the hope in three two one ada does your captain

1402
04:22:57,209 --> 04:23:03,370
seriously intend to do a micro jump in system with engines that haven't been powered in 70 years

1403
04:23:03,370 --> 04:23:11,610
on a derelict ship that's what my captain intends yes but that is a gross misuse of the skip drive

1404
04:23:11,610 --> 04:23:16,569

1471
04:36:25,139 --> 04:36:29,860
i'm not going to go begging the board for forgiveness i always suspected this would happen

1472
04:36:29,860 --> 04:36:33,779
the board finally discovered what i'd done and sent their head hunters to track me down but

1479
04:37:10,549 --> 04:37:14,950

04:40:44,220 --> 04:40:55,720
board stooges with bullets does sound like a ride and a half to extract the scientist you will need

1493
04:40:55,720 --> 04:41:01,479
to infiltrate the labyrinth but that course of action is likely to be quite dangerous captain

1494
04:41:01,479 --> 04:41:08,310
it's because he took off your dentist outfit what's so bad about the labyrinth we can't abandon

1495

1559
04:54:12,330 --> 04:54:22,090
mind taking a swing at yours and you know most people once they're out of prison don't seem keen

on returning oh i would go anywhere to see you fall sir when you go off and get yourself shot

1561

try to avoid taking one to the face i'll want it recognizable to show to my citizens

1562
04:54:38,700 --> 04:54:45,299
uh chairman rockwell i presume my word you correctly identified the most recognizable

1563
04:54:45,299 --> 04:54:49,860
man in the colony remarkable i just want to make sure because when they find your teeth lying around

1564
04:54:49,860 --> 04:54:55,939
they'll be able to identify you then again he's an insane person thankfully he's our insane person

1565
04:54:55,939 --> 04:55:08,229
now a proper company man i'll see if he's please phoenix would rather die than cooperate yes he is

1566
04:55:08,229 --> 04:55:14,599
an extraordinarily obstinate fellow isn't he he isn't working for us per se semantics he'll come

1567
04:55:14,599 --> 04:55:21,080
around but that's between us as far as my adoring citizens will know we've turned a dangerous

1568
04:55:21,080 --> 04:55:28,619
crackpot into a working-class man it's a miracle is this the i feel like i haven't had enough time to

1569
04:55:28,619 --> 04:55:34,599
care that this guy's a villain it was just like this guy's chairman rockwell and here's a video

1570
04:55:35,240 --> 04:55:48,180
and i'll hate this guy it was like it was like 30 minutes ago all right um that's a lie it's pr

1571
04:55:48,180 --> 04:55:53,060
it's for the best really believe me the good people of Byzantium don't want to know what

1572
04:55:53,060 --> 04:55:59,659
goes on here i know halcyon's in rough shape but riots are the last thing anybody needs right now

1573
04:56:00,779 --> 04:56:05,979
another thing captain have you at any point why we're tight not fucking up our entire society

1574
04:56:06,779 --> 04:56:13,340
i believe we could ask you the same i'm making actual progress towards stabilization and recovery

1575
04:56:13,340 --> 04:56:20,040
you're just getting in the way you'd rather you prefer to keep writing this down as far

1576
04:56:20,040 --> 04:56:26,840
i can fix this place i can do it if i and my people can write it out in luxury and happiness

1577
04:56:26,840 --> 04:56:33,159
yes yes i would i don't know if you've noticed captain but halcyon's pretty much a lost cause

1578
04:56:33,159 --> 04:56:40,900
oh well the problem is i've already rallied all of Byzantium against you

1579
04:56:41,619 --> 04:56:48,709
they're outside waiting and they're angry you you have is that what you were doing at the ministry

1580
04:56:49,349 --> 04:56:56,020
i'm not an unreasonable man if you manage to storm the castle as it were and make it out of here

1581
04:56:56,020 --> 04:57:04,599
with phineas alive i can't exactly afford more havoc than you've already caused fine if you survive

1582
04:57:05,240 --> 04:57:10,119
you'll need someone to sell the rest of the board on your plan right because it'll be me

1583
04:57:11,319 --> 04:57:23,479
uh you're damn right right you just wait here for my orders hey and tell your tell your dog to stop

1584
04:57:27,939 --> 04:57:45,479
that was easy just stay there phineas shoot him no no no not yet not yet wait patience

1585
04:57:46,119 --> 04:58:13,979
one of your runs he won't

1586
04:58:24,500 --> 04:58:33,290
wait that's the person i hung up on captain you have an uncanny i hung up on this lady

1587
04:58:35,419 --> 04:58:42,729
you've disrupted the balance of power you've upset the natural order of things you've introduced

1588
04:58:42,729 --> 04:58:46,729
uncertainty and there is nothing i despise more than uncertainty

1589
04:58:48,889 --> 04:58:54,490
it's over sophia stand down we are liberating halcyon and there's not a damn thing you can do

1590
04:58:54,490 --> 04:59:00,250
to stop us wow when you put it that way i sound pretty awesome typical running your mouth in the

1591
04:59:00,250 --> 04:59:08,009
middle of a crisis it's almost as if you delighted chaos my report said you were simple constant

1592
04:59:08,009 --> 04:59:11,930
i simply never imagined you'd be stupid enough to throw the entire system

1593
04:59:11,930 --> 04:59:19,930
into chaos i should have dealt with you a long time ago you were always too dangerous to leave

1594
04:59:19,930 --> 04:59:27,990
unchecked okay i got a colony safe stop you're making me blush uh can we hurry this up i've got

1595
04:59:27,990 --> 04:59:35,029
an entire colony to save leaving you alive was my greatest mistake but it is a mistake i intend

1596
04:59:35,029 --> 04:59:41,750
to correct i have dr wells in my custody i don't care kill him once i've secured his cooperation

1597
04:59:42,310 --> 04:59:49,430
i can move forward with the program i can repair the damage you've done i can set things right

1598
04:59:50,860 --> 04:59:57,639
i don't whatever don't you don't understand finish is my friend i'm not living without him

1599
04:59:57,639 --> 05:00:00,599

1600
05:00:00,599 --> 05:00:09,540
been enough violence already uh don't test me sophia it's bad for your health i'm aware of

1601
05:00:09,540 --> 05:00:16,340
your propensity for violence halcyon is a bloodier place because of you i wish you'd simply cooperated

1602
05:00:16,340 --> 05:00:29,139
with me you're the finest marksman in halcyon you could have been my gun okay um let's talk

1603
05:00:29,939 --> 05:00:34,180
fair enough i'm giving you exactly one chance to parlay with me

1604
05:00:34,419 --> 05:00:35,220
uh-huh

1605
05:00:41,540 --> 05:00:53,349

1606
05:00:53,349 --> 05:01:05,139
gonna be a big bloody mess okay charm i don't want to fight you sophia you're one of the only

1607
05:01:05,139 --> 05:01:11,540
rational people left anyone with eyes can see that you're talented captain i only wish you used your

1608
05:01:11,619 --> 05:01:16,900
talents for good yeah you wander the system doing as you please answering to no one

1609
05:01:17,540 --> 05:01:25,740
your mere existence throws halcyon into chaos i simply can't have that uh halcyon is changing

1610
05:01:25,740 --> 05:01:29,500
and there's nothing you can do to stop it's time to let go i'm not throwing halcyon into chaos the

1611
05:01:29,500 --> 05:01:35,740
board's doing that all by themselves the board is the only power left in halcyon we're the only

1612
05:01:35,740 --> 05:01:42,060
ones keeping this colony from dissolving into ruin you had so much potential i would have put

1613
05:01:42,060 --> 05:01:48,380
your talents to good use i would have made you wealthy beyond belief was this the matrix

1614
05:01:49,340 --> 05:02:09,049
okay great cool story agent smith uh yeah that ship's been skipped i still can't believe you

1615

even know who this is am i supposed to know who this is oh you could no funny you should say that

1619
05:02:43,450 --> 05:02:48,889

1620
05:02:49,849 --> 05:03:06,810
no ruined ruined ruined the ultimate lie the ultimate lie your plan's never gonna work

1621
05:03:06,810 --> 05:03:12,569
i'm quite aware of your brazen act of corporate vandalism by the way those test subjects you killed

1622
05:03:12,569 --> 05:03:18,490

1629
05:04:28,779 --> 05:04:36,060
have done so many things you should know who i am i you should know from maybe the first few hours

1630
05:04:36,060 --> 05:04:43,430
of the game i could have been a character i don't who the fuck is this i hung up on you maybe 40

1631
05:04:43,430 --> 05:04:49,319
minutes ago in the game these last two major antagonist characters that they've introduced

1632
05:04:50,040 --> 05:05:00,549
i don't even know who these people are i met them like an hour ago this is did i fuck it up

1633

what did i skip all right i got a colony save i have dr well right uh let's talk about this

1634
05:05:14,419 --> 05:05:20,279

1635
05:05:20,279 --> 05:05:26,919
can see that you're you wander the system i do um i'm not throwing alice on the chaos the boards

1636
05:05:26,919 --> 05:05:35,180
doing that all by themselves the board you had so much potential okay uh yeah that ship's been

1637
05:05:35,180 --> 05:05:42,700
skipped i still can't believe you skipped the hope to terror too i know you were always well here's

1638
05:05:42,700 --> 05:05:47,419
the thing funny you should say that because the chairman was just telling me that this is all your

1639
05:05:47,419 --> 05:05:58,360
fault rockwell said that chairman rockwell that's absurd you're lying this is another one of your

1640
05:05:58,360 --> 05:06:03,560
tricks i've been the chairman's most reliable associate good we got we got that info at the

1641
05:06:03,560 --> 05:06:11,159
end of the game uh sophie's been overstepping her bounds his words not mine i've already recruited

1642
05:06:11,159 --> 05:06:14,680
the chairman to my side he's done working with you you let the situation get out of hand rockwell

1643
05:06:14,680 --> 05:06:23,860
once you've gone that's ridiculous halcyon is collapsing the labyrinth is riding you're

1644
05:06:23,860 --> 05:06:29,619
running wild through the colony and i let the situation get out of hand i have given

1645
05:06:29,619 --> 05:06:35,459
that's what he said nothing less than a lifetime of loyal honorable service and this is how he

1646
05:06:35,459 --> 05:06:43,209
repays me by leaving me twisting in the wind everyone's disposable to the board sophie

1647
05:06:44,009 --> 05:06:52,740
even you enough i'm not going to stand here bickering with you i was expecting the chairman's

1648
05:06:52,740 --> 05:06:58,619
support but i'll have to do without he also said i dare you to come trying to shoot me on the program

1649
05:06:58,619 --> 05:07:06,470
yet you've caused some complications but i can improvise i can fix this he said i haven't lost

1650
05:07:06,470 --> 05:07:12,389
control of the lab i bet she can't open the door and fire within a second operational i can still

1651
05:07:12,389 --> 05:07:17,659
put a stop to you no

1652
05:07:20,380 --> 05:07:25,659
i'm sorry i was taking over a security system in the process i'm not a hacker i can't get

1653
05:07:25,659 --> 05:07:32,819
even i can't get to 80 hack i can't get to 80 hack i don't have it no i can't

1654
05:07:36,490 --> 05:07:45,979
game sucks i can't do it i haven't lost control elaborate our security uh i destroyed your

1655
05:07:45,979 --> 05:07:51,340
experiments in the ministry your plan's never gonna work yes i'm quite aware of your brazen

1656
05:07:51,340 --> 05:07:57,659
act of corporate vandalism by the way those test subjects you killed they died in agony

1657
05:07:59,159 --> 05:08:04,840
my scientists assure me they can recover the data you've destroyed you've succeeded in temporarily

1658
05:08:04,840 --> 05:08:12,630
delaying our research nothing more phineas tells me your scientists are hopelessly lost all your

1659
05:08:12,630 --> 05:08:18,150
research is wrong your scientists are lying to you their research is critically flawed your

1660
05:08:18,229 --> 05:08:24,389
scientists are lying i wrecked that data that experiment was badly engineered i'm gonna talk

1661
05:08:24,389 --> 05:08:30,700
about lies we're gonna keep the lies going your scientists are lying to you their research is

1662
05:08:30,700 --> 05:08:40,380
critically flawed i mean it's the research isn't it was terrible it was awful that isn't true

1663
05:08:41,180 --> 05:08:49,990
it can't be you're trying to manipulate me that experiment was absolutely essential to the program

1664
05:08:50,630 --> 05:08:54,709
my scientists assured me they were close to a breakthrough sure you're not surrounded by

1665
05:08:54,709 --> 05:09:03,700
liars gave me their word uh you took the word of a bunch of corporate lab coats and people say

1666
05:09:03,700 --> 05:09:11,299
i'm slow i don't know what pains me more realizing that i've been lied to or hearing the truth from

1667
05:09:11,299 --> 05:09:17,619
an idiot like you we're going to have to start all over again all that research all those

1668
05:09:17,700 --> 05:09:25,080
experiments you've sent us back decades i don't see any reason to continue arguing with you

1669
05:09:26,119 --> 05:09:30,599
i know when i'm beaten the only thing left to do she's surrendering

1670

1682
05:11:50,279 --> 05:11:58,900
whatever they want to you just have to everyone's so gullible i could tell everybody in this game

1683
05:11:58,900 --> 05:12:05,619
that the sky was not blue that it was green and they wouldn't even look up to confirm it they

1684
05:12:05,619 --> 05:12:11,779
would just go green you say wow that's interesting really green damn i thought it was blue anyways

1685
05:12:11,779 --> 05:12:25,529
here's the key card uh oh yeah the board never stood a chance against me you know i wouldn't

1686
05:12:25,529 --> 05:12:29,450
let anything happen to you vinius do you have any idea how much trouble i went to save you what

1687
05:12:29,450 --> 05:12:35,529
break into the most heavily guarded facility in the most hostile world in halcyon no i have

1688
05:12:35,529 --> 05:12:42,569
absolutely no idea how you did it you're a goddamn miracle worker you've broken the board's

1689
05:12:42,569 --> 05:12:48,409
stranglehold on this colony and you saved my life but there's still so much we have yet to

1690
05:12:48,409 --> 05:12:55,689
accomplish you and i are going to have to work harder than ever to save halcyon i'm afraid the

1691
05:12:55,689 --> 05:13:04,009
situation is far worse than any of us ever anticipated uh i was just about to pop open

1692
05:13:04,009 --> 05:13:08,810
some drinks to celebrate i would like nothing more than to celebrate this victory but we have

1693
05:13:08,810 --> 05:13:14,979
a serious problem on our hands earth has gone you literally walked through everything received a

1694
05:13:14,979 --> 05:13:21,619
single message in three years there's been no communication no signals nothing two years ago

1695
05:13:21,619 --> 05:13:26,259
the earth's directorate's frigate disappeared on their way back to earth we don't know what they

1696
05:13:26,259 --> 05:13:32,259
discovered when they arrived or if they arrived at all they haven't exactly been hands-on around

1697
05:13:32,259 --> 05:13:38,580
here anyway so there's one less rubber stamp to worry about earth is humanity's home planet

1698
05:13:39,540 --> 05:13:44,020
the psychological effects of losing our original home will be devastating

1699
05:13:45,060 --> 05:13:52,259
i got a master liar now this that's it i'm done there is no plan just random

1700
05:13:52,259 --> 05:13:58,819
chaos you're experiencing a crisis of faith preacher don't worry that just means you're

1701
05:13:58,819 --> 05:14:05,060
paying attention we're in serious trouble my friend do you know what this means for halcyon

1702
05:14:05,060 --> 05:14:11,060
we can't rely on earth for support anymore we've been cut loose we're entirely on our own

1703
05:14:14,229 --> 05:14:20,520
we have a lot of work ahead of us we better get started yes we do you've done a marvelous thing

1704
05:14:20,520 --> 05:14:26,680
you've succeeded where anyone else would have failed including me we must begin the revival

1705
05:14:26,680 --> 05:14:31,560
process immediately starting with the hopes of brightest minds and then we're going to fix this

1706
05:14:31,560 --> 05:14:36,520
damn colony one problem at a time wait what do you mean starting we're going to need a leader

1707
05:14:36,520 --> 05:14:42,599
and i can't imagine a better person for the job than you what do you say old friend will you help

1708
05:14:42,599 --> 05:14:49,299
us well you want to be ceo i've got plans with the chairman in my pocket no one's going to know i'm

1709
05:14:49,299 --> 05:14:53,860
running the colony i'm going to run this colony myself i've already convinced the chairman to take

1710
05:14:53,860 --> 05:15:01,319
my side you can count on me i'll help you revive the other colonists i'm going to do what i've

1711
05:15:01,319 --> 05:15:06,919
always done whatever i want all the time huh oh sorry i wasn't listening i was thinking

1712
05:15:06,919 --> 05:15:13,860
about getting some ice cream i see well you've certainly earned a treat for yourself

1713
05:15:15,400 --> 05:15:20,279
i'll just uh get on with reviving the other colonists and saving halcyon then

1714
05:15:20,279 --> 05:15:32,779
okay enjoy your uh creamed ice or whatever you call it chocolate the osi teaches that everything

1715
05:15:32,779 --> 05:15:39,020
in the universe happens according to the grand plan but the stranger that arrived in halcyon

1716
05:15:39,020 --> 05:15:45,750
was an unplanned variable from the moment he landed in emerald vale his actions altered the

1717
05:15:45,750 --> 05:15:50,709
course of history the events on tartarus brought about the end of the board's authority

1718
05:15:51,509 --> 05:15:58,099
but the board's mistakes would haunt the colony for decades to come the damage they left behind

1719
05:15:58,099 --> 05:16:04,979
would require the work of a generation to repair dr finneas wells began reviving a handful of the

1720
05:16:04,979 --> 05:16:12,259
hopes colonists engineers scientists technicians and intellectuals they were among the brightest

1721
05:16:12,259 --> 05:16:18,099
minds the earth had ever sent out into the stars the hope scientists and engineers woke up in a

1722
05:16:18,099 --> 05:16:26,009
colony descending headlong into total collapse with no way to return to earth they had no choice

1723
05:16:26,009 --> 05:16:32,569
but to band together and devote themselves to the cause of saving halcyon did we do it the people

1724
05:16:32,569 --> 05:16:38,650
of halcyon were nothing if not hardy in the absence of the board's authority many of the

1725
05:16:38,650 --> 05:16:45,689
colony settlements and why are we getting a ps4 dashboard add-on for the end of the game was

1726
05:16:45,689 --> 05:16:51,720
especially hard in the years to come some towns dissolved by attrition and starvation

1727
05:16:52,680 --> 05:16:59,560
but most of them found a way to carry on in the years to come halcyon was forced to reckon with

1728
05:16:59,560 --> 05:17:07,080
its newfound freedom the board was gone and for better or worse the colony was responsible for

1729
05:17:07,080 --> 05:17:14,569
its own destiny left unchecked the war on monarch consumed both msi and the iconoclasts

1730
05:17:15,290 --> 05:17:20,409
and when the sulfur clouds settled only stragglers from both factions remained

1731
05:17:21,610 --> 05:17:27,610
some found their way to who is that person who is that person and some lived their final years

1732
05:17:27,610 --> 05:17:36,009
fighting for food in the wilderness in the end only the beasts remained made mcdevitt replaced

1733
05:17:36,009 --> 05:17:42,970
reed tobson as the leader of edgewater she and her followers transformed edgewater in their image

1734
05:17:43,930 --> 05:17:50,889
anyone was pressured into leaving town and those who stayed behind are they omitting stuff from

1735
05:17:50,889 --> 05:17:58,169
history i murdered them transform the old cannery into a new garden the nearby edgewater cemetery

1736
05:17:58,169 --> 05:18:04,490
provided a convenient source of fertilizer it was said that the first corpse that fed her garden

1737
05:18:04,490 --> 05:18:11,849
belonged to reed tobson under the leadership of junley tennyson this is what it is corporate

1738
05:18:11,849 --> 05:18:17,209
influence the ship's mechanical stability gave junley the time to educate a promising

1739
05:18:17,209 --> 05:18:22,810
generation re writing the history schooled in her family so on it's the ultimate line the future of

1740
05:18:22,810 --> 05:18:29,580
the groundbreaker books i'm just this is more line of the hope and the abandonment of the lifetime

1741
05:18:29,580 --> 05:18:36,139
employment program forced byzantium to come to terms with some uncomfortable realities about the

1742
05:18:36,139 --> 05:18:42,619
state of halcyon while byzantines were reluctant to surrender the luxuries they'd grown accustomed to

1743
05:18:42,700 --> 05:18:48,500
the board's diminished authority gave them little choice in the matter no pepe hands nearly everyone

1744
05:18:48,500 --> 05:18:53,619
had to learn to make do with land oh not pepe hands uh no is that pepe hands even had to get

1745
05:18:53,619 --> 05:19:03,479
jobs it was a dark time indeed we savored her adventures on the unreliable once they were done

1746
05:19:04,040 --> 05:19:10,759
she returned to life as usual running missions of dubious legality shunning respectable work

1747
05:19:11,319 --> 05:19:15,959
and living life to the fullest wait we don't we don't talk anymore

1748
05:19:17,560 --> 05:19:24,680
but she was always bad okay after all he'd seen and heard adventuring with you

1749
05:19:25,400 --> 05:19:31,880
the vicar maximilian de soto renounced his faith and joined the effort to rebuild the colony

1750
05:19:31,880 --> 05:19:36,919
ironically he finally found the joy that had eluded him over the course of his life

1751
05:19:37,560 --> 05:19:42,680
and realized that perhaps he was always meant to you made him give up god laborer after all

1752
05:19:43,560 --> 05:19:49,639
he quickly dismissed the idea he ruined his life he left the crew of the unreliable little was

1753
05:19:49,639 --> 05:19:56,520
hurt from her again she exchanged occasional messages with ada but they were light on details

1754
05:19:56,520 --> 05:20:02,919
and grew increasingly infrequent months later her name appeared on the manifest of a research

1755
05:20:02,919 --> 05:20:09,479
vessel that vanished during an unexpected solar storm as hard as she tried to drink them away

1756
05:20:11,159 --> 05:20:18,119
eventually overcame her traveling with a crew served as a that was everybody's favorite character

1757
05:20:18,119 --> 05:20:23,319
i oh you found my favorite character i made her leave within 20 minutes and now she's dead most

1758
05:20:23,319 --> 05:20:31,819
comfortable the deep end of a bottle and the far end of a trail few have seen her since the travelers

1759
05:20:31,900 --> 05:20:38,779
often swear they hear her and her machine gun in the night screaming swears and spitting bullets

1760
05:20:39,659 --> 05:20:45,419
the sam unit that accompanied you spread awareness of the product line superior sanitation and

1761
05:20:45,419 --> 05:20:52,220
maintenance capabilities across what was left of the colony this led to a boost sam's doing okay

1762
05:20:53,580 --> 05:20:59,500
did you know that sam units are the longest lasting toughest acting cleaning solution in alcyon

1763
05:21:00,459 --> 05:21:06,060
minister clark was released from house arrest and his contact with you gave him a sense of renewed

1764
05:21:06,060 --> 05:21:11,500
purpose and figure once it became clear that no help would be coming from earth he threw his

1765
05:21:11,500 --> 05:21:16,459
considerable efforts and talents into helping house yon manage the crisis would just get like

1766
05:21:16,459 --> 05:21:21,979
this epilogue of every person we've ever come across sofia akande was the true power behind

1767
05:21:21,979 --> 05:21:28,680
chairman rockwell however after the riots on tartarus she was never again seen in the colony

1768
05:21:29,979 --> 05:21:35,979
various theories circulated after her fate some believe she boarded an interstellar ship

1769
05:21:35,979 --> 05:21:42,220
capable of journeying to a distant colony others believe she died trying to escape tartarus

1770
05:21:43,419 --> 05:21:48,939
some few suggest she fled to monarch where she continued to live among a small band of loyalists

1771
05:21:48,939 --> 05:21:53,659
and then there's me there is another fear the narrator of this story that sophia's encounter

1772
05:21:54,060 --> 05:21:58,860
and here's uh it's me talking deliberately retreated from public view but continued

1773
05:21:58,860 --> 05:22:04,939
supporting the colony in secret when dr wells began reviving the hopes colonists he found

1774
05:22:04,939 --> 05:22:10,700
himself with a sudden windfall of additional supplies and resources courtesy of an anonymous

1775
05:22:10,700 --> 05:22:20,650
donor if world knew who it's bugleberry never chairman rockwell also for the changes in house

1776
05:22:20,970 --> 05:22:27,689
to come whenever you needed strings pulled or a voice to sell a policy change rockwell was only

1777
05:22:27,689 --> 05:22:33,450
too happy to oblige they should have killed him as for dr phineas wells he spent his remaining

1778
05:22:33,450 --> 05:22:41,000
years in his orbital lab he did by the failures of his past um he was determined to make things

1779
05:22:41,000 --> 05:22:47,000
right by building toward what happens if you kill everybody do you even get an end of the game

1780
05:22:47,720 --> 05:22:52,919
engineers than he first expected thanks to the additional batch of chemicals you stole from the

1781
05:22:52,919 --> 05:22:59,000
ministry wells never forgot about the human lives that were lost in acquiring these chemicals does

1782
05:22:59,000 --> 05:23:07,639
it just get to the end here it just goes the end despite limited resources over half the hopes

1783
05:23:07,639 --> 05:23:14,119
colonists were successfully revived even after wells passed away the hopes scientists and

1784
05:23:14,119 --> 05:23:21,240
engineers worked night and day to pull halcyon from the brink of collapse their efforts continued

1785
05:23:21,240 --> 05:23:27,750
to this day which may be reason enough for optimism dr wells laid the groundwork for

1786
05:23:27,750 --> 05:23:32,310
the project to save the colony but he would never live to see the fruits of his labor

1787
05:23:33,110 --> 05:23:39,029
he passed away a few years later his work was carried on by the scientists and engineers he

1788
05:23:39,029 --> 05:23:45,750
revived life will never be the same in halcyon it is widely agreed that the colony has a chance

1789
05:23:45,750 --> 05:23:51,349
of stabilizing within a generation owing to the hard work and determination of the surviving

1790
05:23:51,349 --> 05:23:59,819
colonists recovery is a distant goal and the path is long and uncertain but the people of halcyon

1791
05:23:59,819 --> 05:24:07,740
carry on determined as ever and what about you the unplanned variable in the history of what happened

1792
05:24:07,740 --> 05:24:14,939
to me you brought an end to the chaos on trotter and left dr wells to save halcyon on his own

1793
05:24:15,750 --> 05:24:22,900
you had more pressing matters to attend to as you tasted your first scoop of risos partially

1794
05:24:22,900 --> 05:24:31,459
emulsified semi-frozen milk like dessert you realized something all your troubles all your

1795
05:24:31,459 --> 05:24:40,840
adventures all your struggles and choices they had all led to this single moment and it was all

1796
05:24:40,840 --> 05:24:46,619
worth it there's a nice touch i like that what happened to earth and no one knows what the

1797
05:24:46,619 --> 05:24:54,299
future has in store for halcyon all we know for certain is this the name of the unreliable and

1798
05:24:54,299 --> 05:25:00,700
that of its intrepid captain will remain the subject of countless stories for years to come

1799
05:25:04,779 --> 05:25:17,990
no now it's the end that moral of story oh why be violent when you just lie

1800
05:25:19,270 --> 05:25:43,319
and make everybody believe things that aren't true and save the world ice cream game give final

1801
05:25:43,319 --> 05:25:55,450
score now um i feel like all right the game was fun i thought it was an interesting game i thought

1802
05:25:55,450 --> 05:26:07,380
it was a fun game i do i think it was good but the that main campaign how many main story missions

1803
05:26:07,380 --> 05:26:20,299
even were there like eight i don't they weren't more than like seven or eight main story missions

1804
05:26:20,299 --> 05:26:35,270
in the game maybe ten five and the fact that the the the main sort of antagonist of the entire

1805
05:26:35,270 --> 05:26:41,240
video game they just sort of appear and almost like pretend like you should know who they are

1806
05:26:41,959 --> 05:26:54,470
one of which you only get to see on screen twice you could have gone on a date with pivardi

1807
05:26:54,470 --> 05:27:13,319
oh that's too bad there's a 12 minute speed run if you go evil and corporate you meet them earlier

1808
05:27:13,319 --> 05:27:23,400
wasn't i corporate i wasn't i doing stuff for corporate including the optional quest he didn't

1809
05:27:23,400 --> 05:27:34,180
really miss much 10 to everybody msi is not part of the board all right all right i'm sure there's

1810
05:27:34,180 --> 05:27:42,330
plenty of stuff that i didn't do i did two runs of the game and it's barely a difference and there's

1811
05:27:42,330 --> 05:27:54,490
like three board quests but even still though i feel like them if you if you just oh i'm gonna

1812
05:27:54,490 --> 05:28:00,619
do the main i didn't i didn't i felt like i dilly dally a lot was this three i was streaming two

1813
05:28:00,619 --> 05:28:10,889
hours before the internet went down so let's say let's say just under six hours today and then

1814
05:28:10,889 --> 05:28:18,950
seven six or seven hours yesterday and then four so like 16 17 hours in the game 15 hours in game

1815
05:28:23,990 --> 05:28:28,630
now i guess that's still that's still pretty good if for but i still i feel like i did other stuff

1816
05:28:28,630 --> 05:28:42,009
too i wasn't just doing story missions 15 to 25 is the average yeah took me about 30 hours to do

1817
05:28:42,009 --> 05:29:01,479
everything okay i did skip an optional planet yeah that's probably true but it's hard to place it

1818
05:29:01,479 --> 05:29:23,659
it was it was like a it was like a seven three seven two something like that it got maybe point

1819
05:29:23,659 --> 05:29:35,689
two point three base points there because the ice cream ending it was good i i look i wouldn't have

1820
05:29:35,689 --> 05:29:44,340
played it and stream the whole thing if i didn't think it was any fun maybe like a c like a seven

1821
05:29:44,340 --> 05:29:56,709
seven one there you go i wasn't a fan of the ending but i was a liar so like i like lied

1822
05:29:56,709 --> 05:30:04,619
to myself about of you know in the first place i said the same thing yesterday too it's it was

1823
05:30:04,619 --> 05:30:08,540
i had an enjoyable experience in the video game and not every video game has to be the best game

1824
05:30:08,540 --> 05:30:23,779
you ever played so there's that too i lie to myself every day would it have been as funny if

1825
05:30:23,779 --> 05:30:33,049
you didn't go down the liar route maybe not but you know how i mean everybody that plays this game

1826
05:30:33,049 --> 05:30:45,880
is gonna play it a little differently new vegas now or whoa i've ruined new vegas for myself i

1827
05:30:45,880 --> 05:30:52,180
can't play it i was being chased by like a hundred easy peets i would i had the time gun

1828
05:30:53,220 --> 05:31:07,159
i can't play new vegas again i can't do it i stepped way out of i i like pulled myself out

1829
05:31:07,159 --> 05:31:20,729
of the universe and just made it a shit show but new vegas is overrated i didn't i didn't say that

1830
05:31:20,729 --> 05:31:26,090
i thought it was good for the two about full streams i played it until i cheated this is where

1831
05:31:26,090 --> 05:31:31,639
it went very very very wrong there was a point in new vegas when i couldn't open the door i

1832
05:31:31,639 --> 05:31:37,959
remember explicitly where it was it was in that bar with the um there was a show going on behind

1833
05:31:37,959 --> 05:31:41,319
the door and i didn't feel like going to get the key so i just no clip through the door

1834
05:31:42,729 --> 05:31:46,490
and that was it it was over over at that point because i and then now you've ruined everything

1835
05:31:46,490 --> 05:32:03,099
and you can do that everywhere and then i but it don't matter anyways thank you for watching

1836
05:32:03,740 --> 05:32:08,220
that's going to be the end of the stream well i know it looks like it's been a three and a

1837
05:32:08,220 --> 05:32:13,979
half hour stream but it's actually been about six because of uh the internet crashing halfway through

1838
05:32:14,700 --> 05:32:21,639
but thanks for watching i'll see you guys in like three or four days probably on

1839
05:32:24,139 --> 05:32:30,549
either monday or tuesday and we're probably going to just start halo because that's when it comes

1840
05:32:30,549 --> 05:32:36,939
out right i have those of you that don't know i have a procedure coming up here i have to do

1841
05:32:36,939 --> 05:32:41,020
another endoscopy and it's gonna put me on drugs it's gonna fuck me up for a day or two and i have

1842
05:32:41,020 --> 05:32:44,139
to fast the night before so there's gonna be like two or three days when i'm just gonna kind of be

1843
05:32:44,139 --> 05:32:55,750
out of it so i have to do that hope you had a happy thanksgiving everybody that celebrates it

1844
05:32:55,750 --> 05:33:03,479
i will see you guys at the latest probably tuesday either monday or tuesday is when you'll

1845
05:33:03,479 --> 05:33:11,880
probably see me depends on how i feel after everything's done he's kind of being drugged

1846
05:33:15,189 --> 05:33:22,360
see you soon we'll do the bits we'll hang out for a little bit and sorry about the whole thing

1847
05:33:22,360 --> 05:33:28,700
crashing earlier it was very strange it's like the internet went down but it didn't it was very

1848
05:33:28,700 --> 05:33:56,630
weird but yeah see you soon let's transition over here maybe it was a twitch ingest problem

1849
05:33:56,630 --> 05:34:09,450
maybe that's very possible this is still broken it always is yeah it don't matter it seems to reset

1850
05:34:09,450 --> 05:34:16,099
itself after about two or three weeks it then decides to pull from a stream from two weeks ago

1851
05:34:18,540 --> 05:34:24,310
don't ask me why hey shitty viewbot thanks for the 500 bits i was just wondering if you

1852
05:34:24,310 --> 05:34:29,750
ever played any of the serious sam games you seem to have a lot of fun with dusk and the two games

1853
05:34:29,750 --> 05:34:40,139
seem quite similar i had a vision a few years ago where there's a weird dream that i had when

1854
05:34:40,139 --> 05:34:47,849
me and star played it the whole thing so i made a video on it i've had this strange dream about it

1855
05:34:52,220 --> 05:34:58,069
something about that we were getting chased by crabs and stuff it was really really it was

1856
05:34:58,069 --> 05:35:10,970
fun though i remember playing the whole thing was fun but um yeah i thought about it serious sam is

1857
05:35:10,970 --> 05:35:17,299
interesting serious sam is a game that i always have glossed over i don't know why just because

1858
05:35:17,299 --> 05:35:27,419
it seems too chaotic but it's not like i'm against ever playing it 20 to 30 uploads in the future

1859
05:35:36,470 --> 05:35:45,849
uh it has come across my desk a few times and i just go maybe uh thank you dark soul for the 250

1886
05:39:49,049 --> 05:39:53,209
thanks for the 250 happy thanksgiving germa turkey i'm extremely thankful for all the

1887
05:39:53,209 --> 05:39:58,250
outstanding content you've consistently put out over the years as your career as an internet

1888
05:39:58,250 --> 05:40:09,080
comedian superstar and millionaire thank you appreciate that thanks for the 250 bits uh sign

1889
05:40:09,080 --> 05:40:15,419
up with facebook thanks for the 250 uh hey germa why is it that you don't that you have donations

1890
05:40:15,419 --> 05:40:20,220
disabled and only bits turned on you'll get the full money from cash donations unlike bits where

1891
05:40:20,220 --> 05:40:26,380
it splits with twitch i'm sure some people would prefer to donate cash also like that you'd be one

1892
05:40:26,380 --> 05:40:33,610
step closer to becoming bill germates a long time ago i decided against having something like a

1893
05:40:33,610 --> 05:40:41,209
paypal setup because paypal is sort of weird and they will i remember hearing horror stories of

1894
05:40:41,209 --> 05:40:48,459
people sending a bunch of money and then they can charge it back and if you've already transferred

1895
05:40:48,459 --> 05:40:53,340
that money or accepted it or spent it or something then it's like wait you have to give that money

1896
05:40:53,340 --> 05:40:58,700
back and it's like wait what and it goes into like an appeal process i don't know people that still

1897
05:40:58,700 --> 05:41:04,939
do it and well just don't touch the money for 90 days and it's like well okay well just let it sit

1898
05:41:04,939 --> 05:41:10,619
should just have like an a big open pit of a paypal account where i just don't touch it ever and then

1899
05:41:10,619 --> 05:41:17,560
i look at it every like four months to see what's in there so it's just something if i was ever

1900
05:41:17,560 --> 05:41:29,779
going to do anything like that i don't i just don't think i would just it's it's kind of too

1901
05:41:29,779 --> 05:41:44,979
much for me to have to think about spoken like a true crypto backer you just said a contradiction

1902
05:41:44,979 --> 05:41:53,659
what was it what did i not convey the thought did i go off what did i do i said i've charged back

1903
05:41:53,659 --> 05:41:58,540
and people sending money and then like four months later they can take it back it's interesting stuff

1904
05:41:59,500 --> 05:42:05,099
right that's why that's why i don't do it if i ever did that i wouldn't oh right but

1905
05:42:06,299 --> 05:42:10,220
that's me mid-thought changing gears and saying i'm not gonna do it

1906
05:42:10,220 --> 05:42:23,110
there was talk a long time ago of a patreon but a patreon is just subs but on a different website

1907
05:42:24,709 --> 05:42:31,689
you know hey sign up for my patreon hey you you subscribe but there's a different website where

1908
05:42:31,689 --> 05:42:38,409
you can subscribe again it just didn't feel right it felt sort of like didn't feel didn't click

1909
05:42:39,049 --> 05:42:50,439
but you'll get more money yeah but i would rather take a sponsorship or something than

1910
05:42:50,439 --> 05:42:57,529
try to double dip you guys you know what i mean like hey give me five dollars a month on twitch

1911
05:42:57,529 --> 05:43:01,290
all right cool thanks a lot hey you know i got a patreon five dollars a month over there too

1912
05:43:03,159 --> 05:43:13,270
like but you all right i guess but you already you already are doing that just make it as a

1913
05:43:13,270 --> 05:43:23,669
tip jar maybe i just have no goals or reward tiers or anything i guess maybe it would just be there

1914
05:43:28,470 --> 05:43:35,110
it's are a tip jar yeah i know but i'm just saying having bits and subs and then having a patreon is

1915
05:43:35,110 --> 05:43:40,900
like you're asking the same people that are potentially giving money already to do it again

1916
05:43:43,770 --> 05:43:51,049
which i would rather instead of tapping into you guys again for a separate website to pay money

1917
05:43:51,849 --> 05:44:09,099
to i would rather just i would do a sponsorship before that he hates taking our money pepe hands

1918
05:44:12,659 --> 05:44:24,180
you need at least 10 different sources of revenue no i don't need 10 sources of revenue

1919
05:44:28,310 --> 05:44:41,159
but yeah i guess that's a long answer to why i don't have a donation set up i don't know that's

1920
05:44:41,159 --> 05:44:45,959
kind of the thought process but thank you for the 250 sign up with facebook i appreciate it

1921

1924
05:45:20,869 --> 05:45:30,220

1925
05:45:30,220 --> 05:45:33,500
strange but also that would mean that people could reach through and strangle me

1926
05:45:34,380 --> 05:45:51,049
so i'm i'm glad that's not a capable technology at the moment thanks for the 500 bits let's get

1939
05:48:14,299 --> 05:48:19,900

1946
05:49:37,590 --> 05:49:41,349
that person just has to like copy and paste a bunch of commands they might have saved

1947
05:49:41,349 --> 05:49:50,470
and delete everything i've ever worked on they could like delete every nightbot command they
