1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:12,169
Hey, oh, I almost just fell down through my ground. How you doing? Welcome back to the stream, everybody.

2
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:38,549
MakaS, what? Uh, hold on, is there something wrong? What's wrong? No, not again. Hold on, what's

3
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:53,579
wrong? Hello? Why is this doing this? This is- there's no- there's no sound effects on. There's no-

4
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,380
Okay, this- I- I don't know what just happened. I don't know why there was- I don't know- I

5
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,710
don't know what happened. What I do know is now it's gone, and...

6
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:17,379
On the GoXLR, there's an effects button. You can press it, and I didn't press it. It shouldn't

7
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:27,379
be doing that at all. That button was not pressed. We sound- we're good now? We sound fine? We're good,

8
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:35,900
right? This is a good audible level. I think we sound fine. Let me turn this off. Okay. Where's

9
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,299
the shoe? Yeah, I know. I know. Let me- I can address the shoe situation in just a moment. Just

10
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,980
wait for people- people have to trickle in for it. Uh, whatever. I'm just gonna talk about it right

11
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:58,870
now. You can link to this if you want. The shoe eating stream had to be postponed because there-

12
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:05,459
There's been, obviously, a lot of, um, panic in the grocery stores. There's been a lot of,

13
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,900
like, the national emergency being called, countries being locked down. It- it was actually

14
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,610
kind of not on the priority list at the last, like, three or four days. It actually was probably

15
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:25,189
gonna be pretty hard to get somebody to make a comedy shoe. So, because, like, the bakery that

16
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:31,020
I was gonna use was not really, uh- it's kind of hard to do that the last two or three days.

17
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,509
I was gonna have a fucking comedy shoecake made, all right? That's the joke. And now it's- I-

18
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:50,949
what am I supposed to do? I have to tell you the joke. What it is. Now you have to eat a real shoe.

19
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,539
I'm not eating a real shoe. You could make 15 accounts if you want. Dermal lied about eating

20
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:04,180
a real shoe. And plus, it was a me costume, by the way. I don't have to eat a real shoe. I- I

21
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:15,400
could eat, like, a fucking Ring Pop if I want. Eat shoe. Eat shoe. I'm not gonna eat a real shoe.

22
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,439
Why would I ever eat a real shoe? Think about this. I- you guys have to process this information.

23
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:35,879
Imagine eating a shoe. You can't eat a fucking shoe. You said. Yeah, I- how many fucked up things

24
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,900
have I said on this stream? You can't eat a shoe. I'll- I will have to go to- I'll have to go to,

25
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,539
like, the hospital if I eat a shoe. I'll die if I eat a shoe. If you eat a shoe, you die. Right?

26
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:53,419
Like, you can't just eat a shoe. Leather is edible. You want me to go buy, like,

27
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,020
leather shoe? I'm not- no, leather- no, no, no, no. I'm not- why do I- I'm getting a little

28
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:05,979
worked up now. I'm- yeah, I gotta calm down. I'm not eating a fucking real shoe. I'm not eating a

29
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:11,719
fucking shoe. I had, like, a comedy routine planned out and it kind of fell through.

30
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,579
Doesn't mean I'm not gonna do it. I'll- okay, I will eat a comedy shoe within the next two weeks.

31
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm not gonna eat a real one. I'm not spending any more time on, on, like, eat the fucking shoe.

32
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm not gonna spend any more time on this. Don't- don't talk about- why are people talking about

33
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:44,980
that? That's pre-stream chat spoilers. Come on. Just have them make- you can eat leather shoes

34
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:59,129
if you boil them. No, you can't. No, you can't. No, you can't. You can't eat shoes. No, you can't.

35
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:08,790
I'm not eating a fucking shoe. Okay, here you go, guys. I will eat a shoe if there- if- no,

36
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,550
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not fucking going over this. I'm not gonna boil a pair of

37
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:23,720
leather shoes. I love the- I love- the best response to this is, in all capitals, look it up.

38
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:30,620
Yeah, um, I could eat the t-shirt that's on me right now, probably, if I boil it and, like,

39
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,060
remove the ink. Do I- am I gonna do that? No, it's very bad for you. It's probably not- it's

40
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:47,319
not- it's probably so bad for you. Eat a shoe, you poser. Um, you can't call somebody a poser

41
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,860
for something that literally no one has done on stream. I- I wouldn't be the poser. I'd be

42
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,350
the first guy that's fucking ever done it. That's not a poser. I'd be the first guy.

43
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:18,490
Okay, TLDR. He read it. He's a Reddit user. TLDR. Um, some of the purchases I would have wanted to

44
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:26,009
make and the coronavirus has caused a lot of widespread kind of panic and people buying a

45
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:30,970
bunch of shit. Grocery stores locked down. Places are, like, you know, it's not- it wasn't on the

46
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,370
priority list the last two or three days. It's been difficult. We're trying to get through this shit.

47
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:47,220
That's an excuse. It's not, though. Preparing for, like, a- all right, let me give you a list of

48
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:55,899
things. Uh, preparing to eat a comedy shoe versus prepare for a global pandemic. Which one of those

49
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:02,980
two things is more important, do you think? I mean, we gotta get some priorities somewhere.

50
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:24,279
It's just- all right. We're gonna play Binding Advising. This doesn't mean that I'm not gonna

51
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,920
eat the comedy shoe, okay? Just pretend that we just gotta- you gotta give me some time.

52
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:45,000
All right, I'm gonna go over something real quick. Uh, real quick. Uh, so there are lines out the door.

53
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,480
All the grocery stores and all the bakeries and stuff. But I say I- I lump bakeries into the

54
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,399
grocery store because I'm a fucking liar. Uh, but there are literally lines out the door for the

55
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,160
grocery store. People are freaking out, buying, like, water, buying, like, thousands of dollars

56
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,819
in groceries. And I was gonna have this bakery in the grocery store. Make- make this. Imagine the guy

57
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,139
walking in there. It's like, oh my god, we gotta get toilet paper. We gotta get water. We gotta get

58
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,019
fucking, um, we could just buy a bunch of frozen foods. There's hundreds of- hundreds of people,

59
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:15,459
thousands of people in these grocery stores. And I'm the guy that walks up to the- to the

60
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:20,310
bakery counter and is like, hey, can you make me a fake funny comedy shoe?

61
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:30,300
Excuse me, sir. Uh, this, like, I gotta- I gotta deal with something over here. Uh,

62
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:42,470
can you make me a funny shoe cake? Uh, sir? Can you look around? Yeah. Sir, this is a fucking

63
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:51,580
global emergency. I need you to make me a funny cake today. Anyways, welcome to the stream.

64
00:08:51,659 --> 00:09:00,250
Take care of yourselves. Be careful. Uh, actually- actually be careful, right? Do your own due

65
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,129
diligence. Take care of your friends and family members, especially the older ones. Because,

66
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,889
you know, but this is- this is- this is the real deal. You know, you can't fuck around.

67
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:25,500
Just be careful. If you have shoes in your house, eat them. All right, we're over the she- we're over

68
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,240
the eating shoes thing now. I'm excited for this because I haven't played Binding Visage in a long

69
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:42,299
time. Uh, this is Anti-Birth. Uh, we talked about this last week. A lot. And, uh, I- you know,

70
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:49,899
when- when you get something in my brain, shit becomes- I can't get it out. My mic is going

71
00:09:49,899 --> 00:10:05,529
in and out? What is wrong with this fucking thing? What? Hello? Hello? All right, here we go.

72
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:13,740
Shouldn't be doing that. That was a one-guy moment? All right, fine. Anyways, um, we're gonna play

73
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,779
Binding Visage. But this is gonna be a gamer stream. I haven't- haven't been in one of these in a long

74
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:25,580
time. But what was the last- Jeremy plays a video game and, like, does- doesn't, like, fucking walk

75
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:36,779
into walls and stuff? How- when- how long ago was that? It hasn't happened. Mario? Two streams ago?

76
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:46,889
Was it? Sekiro? Oh, it was all right. I mean, Mario was okay. But it was probably Sekiro. This is the

77
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:54,440
first time. All right. When does the official- now, here you go. You- people- I know, go ahead and

78
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,570
laugh. Like, make fun of me. This is- this is an old save file. Yes, okay. Hadn't even beaten the

79
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:07,000
game on Hard with Eve yet. I know. You can laugh. But I- this is, like, an old rebirth file. I just

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,309
want to make sure that I didn't have to beat Mom's heart, like, ten times. This is- I had to- this is

81
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:29,769
an old rebirth save file that got pulled. I don't even know who these two are. Minus five. Yeah, but

82
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:36,019
when you play Binding Visage, you just- if you don't- by, like, the third floor, if you're like,

83
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:47,139
nah, nah, this ain't working. You just quit. Ah, why did I say that? People are gonna make fun of me.

84
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,200
What? You- you gotta go all in. Fine, y'all. We'll go all in. All right, who do I want to play with?

85
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:58,950

86
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,840
Let us pick. We'll do in Kane. This is the anti-birth mod, by the way, and soon it's going to be

135
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,380
gonna die and then when i don't die it's like oh nice he didn't die i use that same tactic when

136
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:39,460
i'm by myself too instantly take all pills i know and i just what's the point of even hold it and

137
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,180
what's the point of holding um the trinket now the trinket's just i want to see my stats should

148
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:12,789
he's already playing hard mode you geniuses wait is that supposed to change it to hard mode i'm

149
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:22,470
already in hard mode oh they added the stats in afterbirth right and you can't do them both at

150
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,589
the same time all right do i what is the club is clubs bombs clubs is bombs right there's hearts

155
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:37,369
this is usually really really good third rock you make you mark rock yeah i i knew what i i

156
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:42,099
should have known what i was getting into and i was like i'm gonna play isaac today if you say

157
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:46,259
you're gonna play the binding of isaac what you actually are trying to tell your chat is scream in

158
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:57,160
all capitals missed rock every time you see one i can't get in here no i'm not oh don't get mad

159
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:11,380
where's this missed rock nice nice eyes how did you see that and not me i don't doesn't make i

160
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:20,460
don't it's because you i'm i'm playing the game you're not playing the game no damage up items

161
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,109
it's like really actually is bad there's another one i can't promise to blow it up i don't have

162
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:44,089
anything missing rocks i can't blow them up all right so i brought this up like a few streams

163
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:53,180
ago and i didn't really give it much thought until very recently and maybe even today is this one of

164
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,359
my most favorite games ever made is this like on the on the list somewhere i think it is i think

165
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:07,690
it has to be i i keep coming back to him playing this game like hundreds of times i don't do it

166
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,690
with anything else i used to do that with like team fortress and like that's it how could this

167
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:23,319
not be on that list maybe oh we've got a devil don't go in there oh this build is really bad

168
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:38,869
range up you hate to see that wait what you really hate to see that uh and these are all awful

169
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:48,599
we got a familiar that shoots with me spectral tears or die it that item is i'm not why would i

170
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:59,109
get that that item is just guaranteeing you're gonna die eight times i'm not taking that take

171
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:05,210
guppy why would i take that you get one heart and it's just i'm gonna die nine times and then

172
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,970
going to have to reset not if you're a gamer guppy transformation yeah but that's not guaranteed

173
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:34,420
wrong order idiot what are you talking about i mean wrong order why would i get it i don't know

174
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,619
because this this all right this build sucks so this is like a who gives a shit build you could

175
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:46,650
have taken all three i don't know why i'm gonna hold what do you mean take all three press f6 or

176
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:56,119
f7 for stats somebody confirmed that before i press it i'm gonna just kill me i don't know

177
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:10,759
what that does oh shit okay that just freaked me out i googled it that's our in options no they're

178
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:27,130
not old r i know what that does it doesn't work like the original flash isaac wait what we're

179
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:34,460
going for guppy because that's the only way that this works out what are these um well these like

180
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:42,619
little like white things on the ground are these like collectibles not supposed to be making any

181
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:49,670
jokes that was a mistake this is no joke stream that was not even funny what are these i was

182
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,630
trying to think of what looks like this i was gonna say marshmallows and then i just said

183
00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:00,569
collectibles holy shit that was very bad oh you know these collectibles that was bad that was

184
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:04,779
desperate oh what are these things through the ground i think if something looks that small and

185
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:15,609
white something small and white uh collectibles i don't have seen these guys before either these

186
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:26,099
things are crazy what was that laugh i don't use pictures of fucked up is it where i die

187
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,369
don't when you see like three or four champions in a room you just you just accept that you're

188
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:44,069
gonna die but i guess i didn't all right remind me to blow this up when i get uh bob's brain back

189
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:56,329
f7 all right on sub i'm not gonna press f7 it's gonna kill me that's probably like the

190
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:02,539
suicide button or something right like items that you have you can like die and then maybe

191
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:11,819
is there a die button in isaac i think there is f7 i'm not gonna press f7

192
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:19,380
there's no stats in this one because it's tied to rebirth but this i'm on a mod right now guys

193
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:49,480
what the fuck really yeah they're going yeah just press it they added it to anti-birth f7

194
00:30:49,480 --> 00:31:05,579
no that's not what i want i don't care about that i care about the stats f6 all right let's go

195
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:19,529
whoop that rock okay i'm gonna get two bombs and one key oh well shit and it's the worst thing is

196
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:26,819
it this the poison tears aren't they tied it's tied to luck how often it procs right yeah that's

197
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:41,109
fantastic oh there's a a demon heart watch out for these these ah well this runs egg fucking stupid

198
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:56,809
this run sucks hey well at least i can die 10 fucking times wait a second i have the ankh too

199
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,839
so i have the ankh and i can die 10 times

200
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:15,130
that's so dumb oh boy i don't know what these guys do when they die some of them explode oh

201
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:27,589
they just do the oil okay no you also shoot what the fuck one of them was a bomb

202
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:41,740
what oh that was a heal it scares the shit out of me sometimes how come how come greed modes

203
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,500
not in this because it has an anti-birth thing i talked about this in the pre-stream chat and

204
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,859
i'm the only person in the world that likes greed mode apparently i thought it was like fun

205
00:32:51,500 --> 00:33:00,819
i was like oh man maybe she should maybe uh pog greed mode and everyone's like no fuck you greed

206
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:07,619
mode sucks greed mode fuck greed mode i'm like oh my god i thought i was gonna get like oh pog

207
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:15,619
greed mode no lay not fucking up but i'm about dumb mode sucks delete it oh fuck okay sorry

208
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:36,460
open look at my damage 420 that's it i'm gonna get this up is it chat hates greed mode yeah why

209
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:48,619
what's wrong with it laughing my ass off it's so funny it's so funny oh so that means

210
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,609
the statistics this that's statistically impossible that's not to blow up where i wanted to do

211
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:04,740
that's statistically not even possible it was like 5000 pixels of space but where that could blow up

212
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:23,219
your luck is down that doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything what is this oh okay yeah i know

213
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,980
people are going to be telling me not to do that and shit but it doesn't matter i take every pill

214
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,340
instantly no matter what it is i don't care what it is if i see question marks it's being taken

215
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:46,469
immediately there's no strategy here oh what's that glasses is this double shot oh yes it is

216
00:34:47,030 --> 00:35:08,940
yes okay run save run actually saved i need some hp up though hold r to save run answers vision

217
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,230
does this open up the secret room so i i don't remember what these do oh i hate these guys

218
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:27,269
i'm thinking of a different enemy actually this is not bad at all i'm thinking of the ones that

219
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:36,329
get up and they spit like forward if i hate those guys still this damage really actually suck all

220
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:47,340
right uh what does answers do it was the entire map yeah let's go no wait i should probably save

221
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:53,880
this i should say this is like when i go in the next round yeah next floor all right so where's

222
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,639
the secret room let's see uh secret room is either up here down there no it's definitely over here

223
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:07,800
it's definitely that that that middle section right has to be like right here right this is

224
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:32,760
correct not damn okay so what so then it's over uh up up here bottom left by the boss room no no

225
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:47,429
what a fucking idiot i'm gonna say here god damn it secret room has to be surrounded by at least

226
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:53,260
two these are these are these guesses are perfectly fine these these are perfectly normal

227
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:01,929
this is how you decide grab the hearts i can't pick up hearts i have no heart containers that

228
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:05,929
was perfectly reasonable for me to think it was in the middle or up here it's very reasonable

229
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:23,860
give this double shot dude look at this fucking double shot oh and there's poison on it too give

230
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:30,280
me my luck back give me give me my luck back give me damage up and we got and we're talking this no

231
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:39,610
no i mean i can hurt people with this i've gotten such shitty boss room item

232
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:51,989
it's all right do the challenge room i don't do those the bandage is is insane

233
00:37:53,130 --> 00:38:01,000
oh hold on does this can i use this and will it give me the site will it remove the curse no

234
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:08,789
will it not come on i hate this i hate this because i lose track especially when you get

235
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:24,679
later on in the game so we're going down first remember we went down what's the question mark

236
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,769
under the question mark on the top right what's that little red question mark in the box like the

237
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:44,949
melted box what is that is that the curse are we going right watch out for that oh oh oh oh

238
00:38:44,949 --> 00:39:04,300
what am i watching like a fucking sports game oh oh oh oh oh just take this whole entire like

239
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:11,829
however long this bot is just put it up next to like the red sock no no no no no oh come on

240
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:20,329
come on ref that this has got to be like a referee in this game at some point like a referee enemy

241
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:30,809
uh this thing's dumb come on ump there is okay i've seen a lot of minus twos on this i think

242
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:34,420
that's actually kind of a funny one i think that's actually i think that's kind of funny

243
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:42,019
i think that's funny all right i can walk i'm just no i'll lose i'll forget where this is whatever

244
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:50,900
i'm gonna i might i'm gonna need to cross um uh oh here we go all right do i go in here with the

245
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,460
two keys or do i use the two keys on the item room we're going we're going all in and it was

246
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:08,260
a fucking the right call two hearts stupid worthless see in my mind they can't all be

247
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:17,429
fucking bad in a row they can't but apparently they can uh two hearts don't need it hang man's

248
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:36,599
fine this tier is down getting real close to resetting what was what i just beat the game

249
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,969
on hard with pain right that's the thing i had that's not a long there's not over here he's

250
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:53,340
gonna be reset randy no i'm not not today i know what you guys do i've played this game sometimes

251
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:03,539
all right is it weird for me to actually say that when you get tears down from the pills that is

252
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:10,329
almost an immediate restart no matter where you are in the game right that's like that's like an

253
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:18,840
instant fucking just restart immediately instantly but i'm not going to i'm not going to um i think

254
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:28,539
i am gonna do this though because i need no i'm not a child maneuver is that me being a child

255
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:38,380
or is it me being realistic all right we gotta go we went down right i gotta go up wait did we go

256
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:53,449
left now we gotta go up i might come on i might use the uh hangman over there get the fires or

257
00:41:53,449 --> 00:42:00,869
something i forgot how much i liked this game i mean i don't get me wrong i played this a ton

258
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:07,429
on my switch like in bed but you know i just forget just how much you fucking like something

259
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:16,119
didn't get hit one time by the way you know a lot of you thought that room was going to be

260
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:29,909
impossible to not get hit shit i tried to sneak by i got stuck on the rock in tears down and the

261
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:42,329
guy would have been dead already what's that mean what's that little what was that little like

262
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:56,380
insurance commercial jangle mean that does that does i see something to find something why is

263
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:08,570
it i don't i don't play i've never played anybody he doesn't know i actually don't know tears down

264
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:18,789
let me take it i got extra i know what the blast damage is but that's just that's pretty good

265
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:23,780
that's wait does that count for my active right now that counts for the active right

266
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:36,139
that's a that's blast damage technically right or is it only bomb well we're gonna get some free

267
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:50,010
bombs i forgot it's okay i forgot how huge okay we're good oh what is that thing all right i have

268
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,690
enough money for this what is it what is this thing all right i gotta i gotta look this up on

287
00:47:46,010 --> 00:48:01,510

293
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,019
on isaac you can these guys can eat the bombs but i feel like if anyone's played this game for more

294
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:25,989
than an hour they'd know that already oh we use that hangman right here huh it has to be greed

295
00:49:25,989 --> 00:49:40,969
of course it does oh shit minions somebody get the alts that's actually really that's really good

296
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:51,130
i got a steam sale from that everything 50 off what's this who cares take it instantly speed up

297
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,699

301
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:05,420
that's not cheating guys i can die nine more times i'll be all right the way this is going

302
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,139
to be a problem is if i don't have more than like two or three hearts going into like womb two

303
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:24,710
oh jeez i don't know i don't know the tech i don't know the tech on these guys

309
00:52:45,769 --> 00:52:51,780
would say this game reminds me more of star tropics than it does of zelda in fact it's

310
00:52:51,780 --> 00:53:01,690
almost the exact same video game those who don't know what that is i'm seeing a lot of question

460
01:27:34,569 --> 01:27:40,890
what i say by this is remember back in 2012 when somebody would make a let's play of a game

461
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:47,850
and it would be 12 minutes and you'd make a new video every 12 fucking minutes that's why i never

462
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:52,010
played these games i never did let's plays could you imagine if i only streamed for 12 minutes a

463
01:27:52,010 --> 01:28:04,939
day anyways i'm playing with uh this is cain and i see you guys in uh 12 or 15 separate youtube

467
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:55,579
whole game until his phase three he becomes the second easiest boss in the game but for some

468
01:28:55,579 --> 01:29:02,619
reason i have so much trouble with the third phase because my brain um is made out of eggs

535
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:48,300
what it does what does this look like oh what's it called oculus rift fire tears now have a chance

536
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:53,260
to summon a rift when they land on the ground the spawned rift sucks in enemies projectiles

537
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:59,420
and pickups and deals damage to enemies caught inside that sounds so much fun but i can't touch

it it sucks it's not good item suck suck suck oh does it oh okay well just it's stuck what's the

539
01:44:15,939 --> 01:44:23,500
left one that's the contract right contract from below doubles your pickup drops including chests

540
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:28,840
soul hearts and other consumables which spawn at the end of a room but i'll only have one heart

629
02:05:44,890 --> 02:06:01,739
it's not even funny but it is why is that funny it is all right let's go to the keynote i mean if

630
02:06:01,739 --> 02:06:06,779
i had like a million dollars right now i would just keep having like halving halving halving

631
02:06:06,779 --> 02:06:31,800
halving my tier delay until it was like 0.2 he's malding where do you get that idea there's a hard

632
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:37,800
cap of five tiers well although technically true you can go under the cap if you have things that

633
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:48,250
half your tier delay even if you have a tier delay item it'll work that is that is actually

634
02:06:48,649 --> 02:07:07,109
she's called me a nerd for knowing that all right okay well how you want to respond to that one

635
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:19,300
i should what should i say no i'm not go in curse room if i have extra health to work with i will

636
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:26,180
i don't uh i'm not gonna do this either if i had like four or five full hearts i'd probably do this

637
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:37,770
and you need like a i'm not doing it use door on key what are you talking about get rid of the

638
02:07:37,770 --> 02:08:03,079
carters everyone's got a wedgie i actually kind of do that i i do actually it's been bothering

639
02:08:03,079 --> 02:08:17,220
me for like the last 15 straight minutes so the person's not wrong what's this brain worm

640
02:08:17,220 --> 02:08:34,340
ding brain worm let's look it up brain worm mist tears will redirect themselves and travel

641
02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:57,560
sideways towards enemies holy shit this is unbelievably good that's very very good the

642
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:05,180
amount of times that you miss by one or two pixels in this game is that corrected completely this is

643
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:12,359
awesome well maybe not quite that kind of wow this is great okay now all i need is a shit load

644
02:09:12,359 --> 02:09:30,470
of tears up and like plus 10 damage and 10 more hearts and i should i'll beat the game seeing the

645
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:38,439
beam is like i'm about to hold r it's just but it's just such a waste of an item oh she's gonna

646
02:09:38,439 --> 02:09:43,720
be looking to do sad face the bean he doesn't like to be no nobody does nobody thinks that item is

647
02:09:43,720 --> 02:10:08,899

02:10:08,899 --> 02:10:14,010
don't spam like i know what the fuck i'm even talking about don't listen to a word i say

i'd rather just dodge them than have to worry about them spinning around in random circles

946
03:31:07,450 --> 03:31:15,940
because after the rift is over it fucking throws like that see i thought that was a portal for a

1041
03:53:51,399 --> 03:54:06,379
look at them all that's really what this game is just throw a hundred dice in the air and count

1476
05:51:48,729 --> 05:52:14,790
whatever the game continue right it's crashed continue continue please what the fuck is this

1477
05:52:20,150 --> 05:52:29,700

1480
05:52:44,740 --> 05:52:49,459
let's go quickly is there anything else i need to

1481
05:52:49,459 --> 05:52:56,069
remember here there was the sun card i should do it all again at least the run isn't over yeah

1482
05:52:56,069 --> 05:53:05,529
that would have been really disappointing it's gonna be really annoying all right don't get like

05:53:51,139 --> 05:54:16,200
keep track of those rocks this time use the diamond card again rocks the rng manipulation

1487
05:54:16,200 --> 05:54:20,680
that's actually going to be kind of a big deal though is that possible that we'll get something

1488
05:54:20,680 --> 05:54:36,459
different items no it's the same seed right oh what just hit me what just happened what did

thanks for the thousand bits ten bucks hey durham i'm trying to make my voice sound deeper because

1878
07:45:48,119 --> 07:45:52,840
i'm a trans guy as a voice actor do you have any good tips for deepening your voice when you talk

1879
07:45:52,919 --> 07:46:05,720
something more masculine um not not necessarily because your vocal cords are your vocal cords

1880
07:46:06,360 --> 07:46:12,259
there's not much you can do about changing your vocal cords or the way that like sound comes

1881
07:46:12,259 --> 07:46:21,080
through them you can manipulate right like i i can go as this is as deep as i can go

1882
07:46:21,880 --> 07:46:30,889
i can't go much deeper than this right but there are people on this earth that for some reason

1883
07:46:30,889 --> 07:46:38,279
their vocal cords and their and their trachea have been able to go even deeper than to the point

1884
07:46:38,279 --> 07:46:49,029
where they are people there's some people that have insanely booming deep voices i don't know

1885
07:46:49,029 --> 07:46:57,180
is that the physiologically how that all really works just smoke a lot that's not gonna worry

1886
07:46:57,180 --> 07:47:04,729
don't make it sound like this it's bugleberry with other markiplier yeah markiplier has one

1887
07:47:04,729 --> 07:47:11,189

07:47:11,189 --> 07:47:23,900
markiplier's voice they really do his the way he speaks is so clear and so it's so radio like

1889
07:47:23,900 --> 07:47:32,919

hello everybody everybody my name is that sound better that sound better why is it this

1892
07:47:49,799 --> 07:47:56,889

1893
07:47:56,889 --> 07:48:03,880
is to it it's an echo i don't know why the echo is on here the echo is not even turned on there's

1894
07:48:03,880 --> 07:48:14,860
a button to turn it on but somebody mentioned speak from the chest which it's hard to describe

1895
07:48:14,860 --> 07:48:23,450
but speaking from the chest and using your entire diaphragm that's what singers do

1906
07:50:15,720 --> 07:50:19,159
i have seen it though it's when his audio just keeps looping over and over again

1907
07:50:19,159 --> 07:50:22,680
and he doesn't know and he's just playing and it's just his he has his own stream open or

07:50:39,479 --> 07:50:58,439
be even worse than this to be honest with you like i think it needs to be like this is good like it's

support to beat some blood-borne bosses jokes aside please accept this meager donation what

07:52:24,470 --> 07:52:28,869
you do is invaluable to your watchers especially in times like these thank you and may everyone

1921
07:52:28,869 --> 07:52:35,110
be well uh the tourist shop ps why didn't you record or stream your first blood-borne playthrough

1922
07:52:35,110 --> 07:52:41,509
you've robbed us you absolute biscuit well that's a very easy answer because i wasn't a streamer

1923
07:52:42,790 --> 07:52:46,709
back when blood-borne came out and i played it three or four times in a row

1924
07:52:47,830 --> 07:52:54,389
it was i had a twitch account i streamed maybe once every four or five months maybe twice a year

1925
07:52:54,389 --> 07:53:01,860
or something it wasn't really until like 2015 2016 that i really started actually streaming

1926
07:53:02,819 --> 07:53:09,990
and spending more than three four plus kind of days a week doing it uh it's before twitch

1927
07:53:10,549 --> 07:53:21,240
before i started using it time for another one maybe maybe uh thank you hall of one zombie for

1928
07:53:21,240 --> 07:53:25,319
the 250 did you ever play out of this world i'd imagine you'd enjoyed it old school platformer

1929
07:53:25,319 --> 07:53:31,479
but really memorable i have played i have played it but another world that is what they made for

1930
07:53:31,479 --> 07:53:39,560
some reason uh they changed the title i don't know why another world out of this world the

1931
07:53:39,560 --> 07:53:49,159
same game dude what he did scream it but what wasn't i shit faced or something wait i did

1932
07:53:49,159 --> 07:54:01,340
stream it for like an hour right i was like drunk i was like shit faced right shit was i drunk when

1933
07:54:01,340 --> 07:54:15,000
i did this there was a i remember what the going the transition from boston to vegas i got trashed

1934
07:54:15,000 --> 07:54:24,580
one night and played like 10 games in a row like minecraft and was that part of that the fake

1935
07:54:24,580 --> 07:54:38,299
stream no no i think this actually happened that was the best worst stream ever this was in 2016

1936
07:54:38,299 --> 07:54:47,610
this was a 2016 stream i don't wow i guess maybe i did it once but i have played out of this world

1937
07:54:47,610 --> 07:54:54,330
and it is very interesting uh fun story about out of this world or another world uh the person that

1938
07:54:54,409 --> 07:55:01,270
did that that is responsible for making that game i'm gonna make sure i get this correct because

1939
07:55:01,270 --> 07:55:05,909
it's pretty cool it's pretty cool piece of information i believe it's the same person that

1940
07:55:05,909 --> 07:55:11,259
did the heart of darkness game is that a complete lie i don't think it is remember the heart of

1941
07:55:11,259 --> 07:55:20,819
darkness game that's not a lie right that's true that's that's that's correct right yeah i just

1942
07:55:20,819 --> 07:55:25,540
want to make something sometimes you you have this knowledge but you don't remember if it's real or

1943
07:55:25,540 --> 07:55:32,229
not is that ever happened to you guys uh that game is also fun i streamed that game i never

1944
07:55:32,229 --> 07:55:37,610
beat it though because it's very hard and very frustrating but i have streamed heart of darkness

1945
07:55:37,610 --> 07:55:51,720
it's very fun wait did i beat it i might have hey spoons for self-defense thanks for 15

1946
07:55:51,720 --> 07:55:57,080
dollars 1500 bits thanks a lot for that hey germa i don't mean to alarm you or anything

1947
07:55:57,080 --> 07:56:00,360
but i hacked your web camera and i've been recording you for the past four months

1948
07:56:00,360 --> 07:56:04,200
i want to talk about your abnormal behavior behavior off stream but if you turn the stream

1949
07:56:04,200 --> 07:56:07,560
off you just sit there motionless unblinking without emotion until it's time to turn the

1950
07:56:07,560 --> 07:56:18,659
stream back on what's the deal with that um this is what all streamers do i thought that was common

1951
07:56:18,659 --> 07:56:26,139
knowledge by now thanks a lot for the 15 dollars bow and jackal thanks to three bucks the toilet

1952
07:56:26,139 --> 07:56:29,819
paper shortage has hit us really hard so it looks like i'll be switching over to diapers soon

1953
07:56:29,819 --> 07:56:35,590
what brand would you recommend for someone who has long gaming streaming sessions well i would

1954
07:56:35,590 --> 07:56:42,709
recommend the uh toilet because a diaper is not going to help you because even if you like shit

1955
07:56:43,189 --> 07:56:49,880
you still have to clean yourself up so that's not going to do very much for you if you piss in a

1956
07:56:49,880 --> 07:56:57,060
diaper you're just making yourself dirty you just pee into the bowl in the toilet so that's not

1957
07:56:57,060 --> 07:57:07,669

2000
08:02:58,090 --> 08:03:04,090
irresponsible to hold a 5 000 person gathering like this uh with the virus going around what

08:03:21,770 --> 08:03:32,180
say shpee none of these are gonna happen i'm going to be really honest say shpee instant drew

2005
08:03:32,180 --> 08:03:40,090
which i'm assuming is having nancy drew game ready to play and tell the shit stain story so

2006
08:03:40,090 --> 08:03:46,069
you want me to have channel points to tell the same story over and over again so like a hundred

2007
08:03:46,069 --> 08:03:52,009
thousand channel points is to tell the shit stain story but if it's only one story so somebody has

2008
08:03:52,009 --> 08:04:01,610
to do that one time and then nobody has to buy it again if none of the no none of those are going

2009
08:04:01,610 --> 08:04:28,979
to happen no no no no that's so funny oh i'll put something there there's no shit i didn't

2010
08:04:28,979 --> 08:04:33,779
