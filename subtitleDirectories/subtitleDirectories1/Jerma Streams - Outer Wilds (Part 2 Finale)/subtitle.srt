1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,129
Hello, good afternoon, good morning, good evening, good afternoon, how, wherever you are.

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,369
Hey, in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:19,820
He took so long to TP back. Uh, a lot of people are not gonna know what you're talking about by that.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,460
We had an extensive pre-stream chat earlier, talking extensively about the idea of, uh,

5
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,700
of having a teleport power. This is why you don't want to miss the pre-stream chats.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:49,350
You're gonna wink? Already? Right now? All right, hold on. Redeem that in just a second. I'm not ready.

7
00:00:50,310 --> 00:01:02,280
Hold on, I'm actually not ready to do that. That wasn't scammed. I just did it.

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,469
Keep your cam on. I love, love, love, love your haircut. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

9
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,340
Does it really have to be 75,000 Pepehands? Well, yeah, otherwise the whole stream would be

10
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,739
winks and I'm like, I don't want to do that. I might just, oh, god damn it, I bumped you.

11
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,560
I might get rid of winks in like a month or two. I don't know. I might like delete winks

12
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,510
and we might change it to something else. Hello? There's always going to be a 75,000 point tier,

13
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,230
but I might change it to like something. I don't know. We got to freshen it up a little bit.

14
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:02,260
I'm saving it for the net. We'll just save it then. I don't know. Every few months,

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,459
we'll make the 75,000 point thing be something different. That's the idea. Anyways, we're going

16
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:14,870
to try to finish Out of Wilds today. If you missed it, we just, I started it yesterday. It's

17
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:20,629
got me interested. It's a really fun, interesting game. And I think it's, I think we got another

18
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:29,349
like six to seven hours in the game. We should be able to do it. And I was here. I was going to

19
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:36,229
start in like 45 minutes, but I'm here and I'm ready. I've eaten. I had two, that's right,

20
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:44,729
two baby food pouches. That's not a lie. Those of you that want advice. Hey, I got any advice to

21
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:50,009
like, how do you get like streaming advice, right? Hey, I'm starting a channel. What's, what, what,

22
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:59,050
what do I do? Baby food pouches. I'm serious. It's incredibly fast. It keeps you going. It's

23
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,729
a quick snack you can have in the middle. Like I go downstairs and pee. And during those breaks,

24
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:10,090
sometimes I'll just grab one of those little baby food like on the go packs and just there it goes.

25
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,990
It's like apple, bananas and strawberries. It's got like a little bit of protein. That's

26
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:25,240
that's not bad. Here's your streamer advice. Like, man, when I want to do like these five,

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:32,340
six, seven plus hour long broadcasts, I did. There you go. Get baby food packets and eat them

28
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:41,460
when you take a break. That's not that weird. It's just a, that's a, that's like one of those

29
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,620
secret tips that no streamers will tell you. All streamers eat baby food. They just don't want you

30
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:59,580
to know. Okay. Let's be clear. You're regressing a little, but we're going to finish Outer Wilds

31
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:08,060
tonight or try to. And then tomorrow I will probably have my Xbox 360 hard drive. We're

32
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:16,649
going to do Tony Hawk's underground. And the next day Diablo two hardcore and maybe Assur's

33
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:29,529
wrath DLC. Maybe it depends on how much I play Diablo two. I also have trying this. I've got this

34
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:38,220
thing on today. I've got this back and rib and stomach brace on today. Trying to take it. It

35
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,050
feels pretty good. Actually. I actually feel pretty good. It's wrapped around. Show it. I mean,

36
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:50,389
I don't think I really can. Hold on. Can you see it's like wrapped around my shoulders?

37
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,990
I have to like, I guess it's probably worth addressing right now because people are just

38
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:03,509
going to think I'm wearing a backpack. You see, dude, why are you wearing a backpack right now?

39
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:12,120
Uh, because I'm going to school. Okay. There you go. It's on here. It wraps around. It pulls me

40
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,339
back. It, there's one, there's like a thing that goes around my stomach too. He's an, an omega

41
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:32,089
gamer. Why do you look like a different guy? What? Why do you look like a different guy?

42
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:47,379
Hold on. What do you mean? I look like a different guy? No, I don't. Why do you look like a different

43
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:54,470
guy? It's, it's me, right? Is this me? No, it's because like the light and the shadows and stuff.

44
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,990
This, this eye over here is like fully in shadow and it's like fucking up your vision.

45
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:10,230
Why do you look like a different guy? Hold on. Let me, let, hold on. Let me, let me quell your

46
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:19,459
fears here. Okay. Here you go. This is what you were used to. Am I, am I a different guy today?

47
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,579
That's better. That's better. Okay. That's better. Now you're, now you're the guy that was here

48
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:32,579
yesterday. The colors in your room changed. It could be anybody. I got a lot of looks too,

49
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:36,819
by the way. People that say, oh man, you look different today. I got like, I, I could probably

50
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:54,600
be like four or five different people. I really could. Anyways, out of wilds. Let's go. What's

51
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:10,199
the last thing we did? You're, this, this streamer is delusional. What, what, how, how am I delusional?

52
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:25,430
What did I say? Dude, quick comet jump joke. No. Oh, okay. I was unraveling the mystery.

53
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,389
This is the best fucking game, mate. Best fucking game. I mean, it's pretty good. It's really, I,

54
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,550
I have to hold, I don't, I, I'm interested in the story. Okay. Those of you that didn't see

55
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,149
yesterday and you liked this game and you're like, well, what the hell has he done so far?

56
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:46,629
This, this is what I've done so far. Uh, I was going to go, where was I going to go first?

57
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:54,680
A hanging city. No. Found a cave with an anglerfish fossil inside, but the opening is only big enough

58
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,639
for my scout. All right. This part of the escape pods and shit, the comet. No, no, no, no. I want

59
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:09,980
to do this. The, the Nomai crafted warp cores at the black hole forge. All right. Where's the black

60
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:21,339
hole forge? Is it in the black hole? We also didn't even find this person. Al says Gabro went to

61
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,939
Giants deep to try to learn more about the Nomai statue. All right. I kind of have to, this is

62
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:29,819
like a tutorial quest. I kind of have to do that. All right. We're going to go try to find that guy

63
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:41,700
on Giants deep. You going to work? See you in four hours. See you in four hours. Hopefully you

64
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:57,620
don't miss the first sun joke of the night. Don't worry. You won't. Okay. Let's go up Giants deep.

65
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,179
I want, wait, is he going to miss the first joke or the first sun joke? Well, he's going to miss

66
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:23,019
the first room of the evening and that's more arguably way more important. Oh, sun crash joke

67
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:31,990
incoming. Here it comes. All right. Slow down. Slow down. This, I get my, this is what people

68
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,950
were saying last time. They're like, dude, please don't fly 300 meters a second into planets.

69
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:46,679
I know, but I just, I know, but look, it's not even moving. Space doesn't make any sense. Look,

70
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:56,259
I'm not even moving right now. You're going too slow. What, what, okay. What would you guys say

71
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:03,399
is a safe speed to go towards a planet? 150, 200 meters. Well, what, what is like the, what's like

72
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,059
the, I could get a speeding ticket. What's the, don't go over like sex 65 70s. You're going to

73
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:21,000
get into speeding ticket. What would it be? 300 250. All right. So this is a safe speed. Yeah.

74
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,460
That's that. This, this seems normal. Let's try to find this guy. Speeding ticket is 800 meters a

75
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:38,120
second near constellation. Okay. Well that's good to know. That's my skincare routine. Uh, hold on.

76
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:52,759
I even, okay, we're good. Uh, my skincare routine is in shower, close eyes, push face into running

77
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:01,100
water from shower head and squint and close my eyes and then rub my face. And then when I get out,

78
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,659
more importantly, I moisturize every day. That's the thing. That's a problem. A lot of people have,

79
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,860
they'll say like, Hey, I got any skincare tips. Yeah. Moisturize your face. Moisturize your face

80
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:28,200
every day. What is over here? Have I been over here? Yeah, I did this already. All right. I did

81
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:41,299
that already. Is there another spot to go? What's this one? Uh, did I do this yet? I think I did.

82
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:45,779
Yep. I climbed up there. That's where the, where else have I not been on this island?

83
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:59,590
Oops. Gabbro. Hold on. Wait, what is this? In the water? Is he in the water? I think he might be in

84
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:10,440
the water. Can the ship go in the water? Yeah, I can. All right. The ship can go in the water.

85
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:35,350
Uh, am I going forward? Am I in the water? Okay. That was weird. I don't think I can move in the

86
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,860
water. All right. Gabbro is definitely down here somewhere. I'm just going to skim the water and

87
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,240
find him. He's playing some kind of flute or something. Wait, there we go. There he is.

88
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:55,269
Hold on. Did you buy this on the Epic store? Uh, I think that's the only place you can get it.

89
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:01,240
There he is. All right. Found him. All right. I'm going to do this tutorial quest.

90
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,600
Oh fuck. Slow down. Oh my God. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt. Tilt.

91
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:13,750
You ever place a land up here? Imagine looking over like up over your shoulder right now.

92
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,500
All right. Is there, there's no landing pad here. Oh wait, I can go this way.

93
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:37,700
All right. There's a spot I can climb up there. All right. Fuck it. Let's go.

94
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:55,879
We're safe. Kind of. Here we go. Unidentified signal nearby.

95
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,200
Is he up? There's ghost and shit in here. That's the ghost. Yep. All right. Hold on.

96
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:16,500
Wait, he was right there. I didn't know that that was somebody in that. I didn't know somebody was

97
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,669
in that. I didn't have my flashlight on and the water was on my face. All right. Let's go.

98
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,899
Nice. It's you. Good to see you made it in here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy,

99
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,620
isn't it? They don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep like dying repeatedly. I don't wait.

100
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:42,340
You're dying too? You're, you're dying too. What about you? Have you died lately? No, it's me too.

101
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,559
We're in a time loop. Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, time loop makes sense.

102
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:55,269
Cool. You're taking this pretty well. Right back at you. Personally, I like the new experiences

103
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,350
and I've never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don't think I've been in a time loop

104
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,789
for this one. It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time's gone all weird.

105
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:09,990
I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they died too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.

106
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,139
He's not as concerned about this as he could be. What if he's going to land and smash his head on

107
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,029
a rock? He's going to land and smash his head on this rock. Or should I tell him to stop playing

108
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:46,019
the flute? Have you ever watched a cyclone for so long it started to hypnotize you? I'm telling you,

109
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:53,000
they'll put you in a trance if you stare at them too long. How's space treating you? I found

110
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,350
something. What'd you find? I reached inside the Statue Island. So the Nomai created those head

111
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:05,860
statues to record memories, huh? Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure for what for,

112
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,659
but it seems like their sort of thing. You think the statues are recording our memories? I'm just

113
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:16,179
holding my eyes open underwater too. My eye's probably burning. You think the statues are

114
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:21,379
recording our memories then, because I remember that one on the bleach beach looked at me funny.

115
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:35,590
That must be my memory friend. I found something. I found what happened to the orbital probe cannon.

116
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,029
That's the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop, for real?

117
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:45,990
Did you figure out why? Too much power. Kind of scary how much that sounds like something

118
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,389
Slate or Feldspar would do. I'm pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke.

119
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:55,429
Come to think of it, broke might be the wrong word, because it looks like the orbital probe

120
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:03,179
cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each loop. So why just you and I

121
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,589
are having a time loop? All right, well give me a tip. Something you might like. At the start of

122
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,789
every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must

123
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,740
be happening up there in orbit around the planet. What else? What else? Have you been to the Statue

124
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,420
Island? That's what I've been calling it. Seeing as it's the island where I found the glowing

125
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,740
Nomai statue. Get it? I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened.

126
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,059
By the way, it's a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid seven out of ten

127
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:40,309
on the Gabriel relaxation skill. If you like checking out Statue Island, it's the one with

128
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:47,740
two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Pretty good, isn't it? Well, mostly connected,

129
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:55,660
isn't it? The way you'll see. Your ship. Definitely on this planet somewhere. I mean,

130
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,619
unless a cyclone came by, toss it into space. That would be pretty nuts.

131
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:07,380
Hope it's not a lone one. We kind of already had that info, but at least I found Gabro.

132
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:22,200
Hold on. I have to adjust my fucking body belt. There we go. That's better. All right, cool.

133
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:33,029
Geo incoming. All right, so I know. Let me go put this in just to have it done.

134
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:48,700
Here we are. Get this away. We've completed it. So Gabro goes this way and this goes. All right,

135
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:59,099
cool. So this has been completed now. We have a full connection to this brain, but this is

136
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:04,440
almost all done. This whole side is almost done. Unless there's something, nothing's connecting

137
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:16,730
from here. This is almost completed over here. Okay. What have I not found over here? Sixth

138
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:27,220
location. Right. I remember I was all fucked up on that. I don't know. Does he have any more info

139
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:41,160
for me? What do you got? What are you doing out here? Well, what are any of us doing? Really?

140
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,279
No, I'm just kidding. I'm out here exploring the solar system. I'll tell you what. Really

141
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:54,890
room to think. It's a quiet and peaceful out here. My ADHD is satisfied. He's usually quiet.

142
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,250
Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my island. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How's space treating you? Where

143
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:07,130
should I explore? What's up with this planet? I know, right? That was just Yoshi. Oh, you mean

144
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,170
like tell you more about it. I got you. Well, Giants Deep is a massive, mostly water. No surprises

145
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,490
there. There's a strong current a ways beneath the surface. Oh, I got to go into the surface. I

146
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,869
got to go into the... All right. I know where I'm going. I tried everything I could think to get

147
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:35,339
past that current and neither idea worked. The land masses I've found. All right. Cool. I didn't

148
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:45,769
skip the lore. It skipped it for me. It deleted me from the conversation. Trying to like take his

149
00:20:45,769 --> 00:21:02,940
spot. Screen. Okay. Oh, what's up with this planet? Let's see it again. Let's try everything. As for

150
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,660
land masses. Yeah. Yeah. You've seen the cyclones. Yeah. They're hard to miss. They'll toss up

151
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,740
everything in path. Islands included. You get picked up trying to land in water. It's not going

152
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:25,109
to kill you. Okay. Beautiful. The ships don't fucking... I have to get this out of the water.

153
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:36,569
What did that do for me? But there was... Oh, yep. Okay. The ocean depths. The Nomai on the construction

154
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:42,569
here saw something sink beneath the underwater current. All right. I'm going for it. Let's see

155
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:50,710
if I can go down there. There's something under the water. Exit ship to repair. Oh, wait. Hold on.

156
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,970
Is this one of those shards in here? Remember? Like here. Look. There's a quantum fluctuation

157
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:07,140
down in the middle of the earth here. In earth. You know what I'm talking about. This way.

158
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:18,569
There it is. Okay. It's inside the center. Can I just try to swim? All right. I'm going. You know,

159
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:24,630
I'm going for it. I'm just going to go for it. You know, you got to... What the hell is that?

160
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,890
You got to go for it. I'm just going to... I'm going for it. You know what I'm saying?

161
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:43,299
Why am I stuck? Okay. Do I have a fuel? Look. I'm dead anyways. Okay. Here we go.

162
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:58,170
Sink to the bottom. Okay. So this is the current. Wait. I was inside of this thing.

163
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,369
I was inside of that. Remember like the electricity? I was inside of this.

164
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:20,420
I was in there. I was inside of that. Okay. Hold on. How do I get in there? What's up here?

165
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:35,430
Ship's gone. It's all right. I get a new one every day. Is this in the cyclone?

166
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:48,359
Dude, this thing is inside the cyclone. Oh, in? I don't think I can get in here.

167
00:23:49,079 --> 00:24:03,160
The current's too strong. I'm trying to go underneath it. I can't like push my body down.

168
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:16,150
Let's see. Why the shipment? I couldn't... The ship sunk all the way to the bottom of the ocean. So

169
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:26,099
why the shipment? I can't move the ship down under water. I thought. I tried to do that earlier.

170
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:46,500
Did it not? I thought it didn't work. Let's go get the ship. Wait. Am I just sinking?

171
00:24:48,779 --> 00:25:03,289
It's so hard to tell even if I'm moving or not. I guess I'm going down. Am I? What? This is going

172
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:22,660
further away. I'm going to go... I'm going to try to get the ship. Check the tornadoes. Yeah. I mean I

173
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,309
I know. I know. I'm just saying like it's besides that lower left indicator. It's like kind of

174
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:48,220
hard to know even what direction I'm facing. Where the fuck is this thing going? Can I like

175
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:57,480
turn this thing off? That's probably what's doing it. The ship is just gone. It just keeps going

176
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:14,410
further and further away. The ship is now leaving. It's like trying to get away from me. The sun's

177
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:24,200
about to explode. All I did was talk to the fucking guy on the beach. Which way is the

178
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:45,690
current going? Where is it going? Hard to see. This way? Forward? Am I moving with the current

179
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:59,589
right now? I don't know. I guess. I mean I look at the globe. I'm moving. I guess I'm moving.

180
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,859
Well, whatever. I'm going to see if I can go in there with the ship.

181
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:30,809
The sun's about to explode, so it doesn't matter. Hello? Where the hell? Where did I just go?

182
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:41,369
Through one of the tornadoes, I guess? And then out of the planet? This is a black hole?

183
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:50,359
That was weird. Well, I'm just going to try this again. The ship is now leaving.

184
00:27:50,359 --> 00:28:21,160
Well, the only new info I got was that I got to go into the bottom of that planet.

185
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,720
Dude, please stop the supernova joke. I can't, man. It gets laughs every time.

186
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:50,170
You guys, if something's working, you got to keep doing it. Okay. Let me see if there's

187
00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:00,650
anything else I could do. Black hole forge. I still haven't done the sun station, which was

188
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:07,740
in... Remember I freaked out yesterday? The high energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twins equator.

189
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:17,779
I still haven't done that. White hole station. Strange warp dog just... Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then

190
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:33,289
high energy lab in the canyon at the Ember Twins equator. I feel like I've tried to go find that

191
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:38,250
five times and every time I get distracted and go, what's this over there? I'm going to try that.

192
00:29:38,250 --> 00:30:00,819
In the canyon. There's a lab in the canyon. I'm going to try that. It's the moon. Let's

193
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:09,799
make progress now. Progress, progress, progress, progress. You have to remember the rule of the

194
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:15,000
sixth location. I don't even know what the rule is. I don't think I figured that out yet.

195
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:43,859
All right. Don't get a speeding ticket. In the canyon. There's a lab in the canyon.

196
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:51,900
Okay. Where like the cream and the cookie goes, that's the canyon, right? Make sure I like,

197
00:30:51,900 --> 00:31:15,430
I get this figured out. Apparently going too fast again. I'm fine. So it's... Just get out.

198
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:34,170
Hello? What's going on? Where am I? Why do I only see white spots? I couldn't move. I couldn't

199
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:40,730
fucking move. Did I get out right when the dust storm landed on top of the ship? Hold on. I got

200
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,049
out of the... I got out of the tank when the sand was touching across the ship.

201
00:31:53,369 --> 00:32:03,640
Got buried in sand like Minecraft. Okay. Again, I went too fast. You know what my biggest problem

202
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:11,380
with me in this game is? Traveling to each... Like traveling from here to a... Like where's my

203
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:18,299
teleport? I can only teleport to die and teleport back here. Why can I not die and teleport back

204
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:25,109
somewhere else? Where's my memory stone? Like I just want to go where I want to go and not fly.

205
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:58,730
Space. What is this? A space game? Immersion. What is this? Space or something? Let's try this again.

206
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:19,880
All right. I'm going to coast in, captain. Right into the fucking creamy center. That's where all

207
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:43,779
the good stuff is. What are you going to wink? That was fake? Fuck. Whatever. I don't see

208
00:33:44,660 --> 00:34:00,259
what could be a lab. You know what I'm saying? Like what's this secret lab? Oh fuck. Watch it.

209
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:03,619
Watch it. Watch it. Watch out. Watch out for the giant death Minecraft trap.

210
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:17,349
I'm just gonna land and I'll figure it out. Okay. I got turned around there

211
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:29,449
because down is up and up is down right now. Let's see if we can get out. Okay. Here we are.

212
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:44,489
The canyon. Lab. Secret lab in the canyon. I've been in here. It's not there though.

213
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,460
This is... Is it... Did I just find it? Did I just find it? I think I just found it.

214
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:13,900
This is like a weird staircase. I think I found it. This is it?

215
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:25,369
Secret lab? No. I've already been here. I think. Right? Haven't I?

216
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:34,710
Holy fucking pog stairs. I think I've been here already. There's this weird thing here.

217
00:35:35,429 --> 00:36:02,329
It seems like I could teleport from that. What's that? Okay. There's like a little bridge here.

218
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:10,550
All right. Wait. Wait for the Minecraft reefer to get the fuck out of the way.

219
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:21,849
What's this? Have I been in here? No, I haven't. Found the secret lab.

220
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:29,019
This door will need to remain closed for some time. I and I are running an experiment based

221
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:35,659
on the extraordinary findings from the white hole station. Remy and I will be running this

222
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:40,699
experiment until one of us, specifically me, can prove the other wrong. So although it's inconvenient,

223
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,619
the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the sunless city.

224
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,329
The lab can only be accessed by the path from the sunless city. Inviting sand inside would

225
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:57,289
disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. If you realize this, it's an

226
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:04,630
extremely... But the door must remain closed. An update. The high energy lab is now being

227
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,269
used to design the Ash Twin project. If you're here to help or even just to observe, be sure

228
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:20,820
to use the sunless city path to the lab. Info. Bingo. High energy lab. Bingo. There's our dark

229
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:27,300
souls shortcut that we can open eventually. All right. Sunless city. Where's that? I gotta

230
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,139
go look that. I gotta go look that up on my little thing. And I gotta get in there. All right. Sunless

231
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:40,739
city. I need my ship. I don't know where I am. I've been there once, but I don't know where that is.

232
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:57,769
Ow. I just broke my teeth. Wait. Ow. I need one of those little block things. Is there one of

233
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:12,090
those lying around? I don't see one. Slapstick in space. I don't see one lying... I have to carry

234
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:19,579
one over here? All right. Well, I got that info. I love getting fucking info. This is a space game.

235
00:38:22,599 --> 00:39:00,630
Dumb. Wait, what? Sunless city. Oh shit. This is the sunless city. You live right here. Ghost.

236
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:09,420
I just broke... What did I just do? What? No, I wanted to read that. What did that sign say?

237
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:25,610
Read it quick. Well, I can still can. Crash site caves. Uh, I can't go in here. Sunless city. How

238
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:37,190
do I get in here? How do you clear out a ghost? How do you clear a ghost? I have to go in here.

239
00:39:37,909 --> 00:40:07,030
There's like 10 in here. Okay, that looks like it's going down, not up. How do I go this way?

240
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:27,369
And like the other side? I've been in the sunless city before. Yeah, but not this direction.

241
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:43,110
It seems like a way I can get in from here. You were in the sunless city before. Yeah, I just

242
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:50,840
don't remember where or how I got in there. Uh, I'm gonna die if I don't go to my ship.

243
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,300
It's hard to remember every location I've been to when all you do in this game is

244
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:22,699
find new locations. It was fine. How do I repair the ship from outside? Do I have to be outside the

245
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:30,730
ship? Do I have to do anything? Do I have to repair it? Or is it just repair it?

246
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:41,429
My reactor core is like broken, isn't it? All right, let me go back over there.

247
00:41:42,070 --> 00:42:08,710
Let me just take... Let me browse. I just want to browse this canyon. It's just window shopping.

248
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:17,639
Is there anything else I didn't do here? Like, what the hell is this? It's like that bridge.

249
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:42,869
What's happening? Did I get stuck on? All right, hold on. Tilt this way. Was this where I was before?

250
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,800
It's inside. You're gonna navigate inside the caves and shit, right? I think it is in here.

251
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:14,710
Get out. If I remember, this is one of the ways to get in here. We got... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,

252
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:29,530
I remember this. So is it up? Is it up or maybe... I don't know. Let me try going up.

253
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:46,250
Have I been here? This is where... Okay, this is the quantum cactus place. I think I've been here

254
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:53,130
already. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen this before. There's a rock in the cave here. Like, bed cave.

255
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,210
Yeah, I've seen this already. This is like, please, if you can help. My... Somebody's missing. Yep.

256
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:26,920
All right. Hi. Can I go down here? I mean, that's like a Mortal Kombat stage. I don't... No,

257
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:56,500
that's death. I can't go down there. But this bridge, it's back there. Let me just check if

258
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:02,940
nothing is over there. No, no, no. I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go deeper into the cave.

259
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:29,860
I might be out of time, though. Sand is coming. Sand is arising. All right. Okay, bring it back.

260
00:45:30,420 --> 00:46:01,420
Come on, quantum. It wasn't this one. It was one more. In. Oh, one more. I gotta find this entrance

261
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:08,039
from here. How much boxes do I have? Yeah, friends find any sign. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's go.

262
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:15,929
So, now I'm in the cave system. It's just a question of where the hell do I get through

263
00:46:15,929 --> 00:46:35,400
the Sunless City? What is this? No. Damn it. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. The nougat.

264
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:59,289
All right. I missed. Okay, good. Let's go up. Looking for... Before the music starts to play

265
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:05,909
and I run out of oxygen, I have to find this entrance to the Sunless City. It's not here.

266
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:36,739
I don't think it's here. Damn it. I'm reading chat. Let me try this one more time.

267
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:50,150
I'm in the rock. Oh, crack. Crack. Crack. Dude, I'm just browsing around Twitch and I'm

268
00:47:51,030 --> 00:48:00,250
looking for a guy that's on crack every day. Am I in the right place? Yep. Yeah, I've already

269
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:07,099
been in here. This rock only goes to three places. We've already done this part. Unless it's like I

270
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:29,349
can't get out of here, right? Is this... I was here already. This is the place with the text,

271
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:45,420
the original one. One, two, three, one. Wait. How curious. This rock took me to a new location.

272
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,389
I wonder why this happened. Curious but also alarming. This new cave appears to lack an

273
00:48:50,389 --> 00:49:04,409
entrance or exit. Wait, no. I was already here. I already did this. How many locations are there

274
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:29,000
actually? Okay, come on. Quantum. Come on. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum. Quantum. Quick. Quantum. Quick.

275
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:57,780
Quantum. Quick. Quantum. Quick. Quantum. I'm going out on my own terms. I'm just going to open one

276
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:23,670
eye and just wait and look straight in the air. This is just an old 80s movie. I can see the

277
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:32,579
laser beam coming. Is it going to kill me? Right in the eye. Where do I die from first? Oxygen or

278
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:51,480
crushed head? What do I do? Tyler wants to interview you. What do you mean interview?

279
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:59,539
All right, let's go. What do you want to know? What do you want to know? What do you got?

280
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:10,360
It all started when I was eight. I saw a movie for the first time and I was like,

281
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:15,659
that's what I want to do. That's what I'm thinking of. It was Ghostbusters 1.

282
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:31,239
That's the Valve, the Valve News Network. Oh, shit. Oh, I don't know why for a second I thought you

283
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:39,369
talked about like somebody in chat named Tyler wanted to interview me right now. Like, hey,

284
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:48,010
I want to interview you. Okay. Yeah, when you want to. Yeah, let's do it. That sounds fun.

285
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:54,460
What do you want to interview me about? Please have it be what my favorite fucking restaurant

286
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:07,429
in Vegas is. Yeah, I'll do that. Sounds fun. Just really important though. I only do 22

287
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:27,420
minute interviews. I'm a very busy man. Ego fucking maniac. No, I do whatever. Hit me up on a.

288
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,340
All right, you know what? Here, hit up one of the mods so I can get your like contact info

289
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:46,469
through like discord and we'll talk. No, no shitty jokes aside. Sounds like fun. I still

290
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:56,389
can't fucking do this. All right. This is more to explore in the ash twin towers.

291
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:03,900
All right, I'm gonna. But I already know that this is somewhere

292
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,579
half from the sunless city. I need to get to the sunless city. I don't know how to get to the sunless

293
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:19,610
city. Sun station. No, I'm not going for sun station again. That's an embarrassment.

294
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,860
You will be embarrassed for me. You know, people go like, oh, what's that thing when you're like

295
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,139
embarrassed for somebody else? It's not you doing it. That's what you're going to have.

296
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:37,219
I don't want to do that. What's it called? Like shot? What's it called? No, no, no. It's called

297
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:47,079
something. It actually has like, it has like a scientific name. Schadenfreude. Schadenfreude.

298
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:56,650
Yes, but that's not it. That's laughing at somebody else's expense. No, that's wrong. It has,

299
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:11,800
it has a name. It's Franscham. Franscham. Yeah, there you go. Somebody got it. It's like, it's

300
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:19,909
like Franscham, right? Franscham. Franscham. How do I say? No, that's, that's actually correct.

301
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:27,820
You actually have that correct. It's like Franscham. Yes. People are spelling it. However

302
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:35,340
you say it. That's, that's actually what it's called. I didn't make that up. I didn't make that

303
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:44,309
up. That's the term. I knew there was a term for it. I don't know how to pronounce it. It's German.

304
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:53,110
Yeah. I think I said it kind of close. Made it up. I'm going a thousand miles per hour.

305
00:54:53,989 --> 00:55:01,300
This happens when I'm arguing about something and I'm holding the left stick up.

306
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:18,260
It's not Imperial. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all I know. Okay. You can make fun of me all

307
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:24,409
you want, but it's, it's what I know. I'm going to drive into the sun. First sun joke of the night.

308
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:29,929
Here it comes. Everyone's been waiting for it. Here it is. The first laugh out loud. He went

309
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:46,889
into the sun joke to explore the tower on the ashtray. First dark wood trap. Yeah. Coming up.

310
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:53,210
Okay. There's more to explore on this like right here, for instance,

311
00:55:53,849 --> 00:56:04,019
but in hot 25 meters per second, five meters per second landing activated. Perfect landing.

312
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:14,460
Get out, get out. You stupid. All right. What do we got? We have this big power. I was going

313
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,699
to say 5g, but it's very easy joke to make and people would probably not think it was funny. So

314
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:29,429
somebody else is going to say it in the chat. I know they are. Get on top of it. Well, uh, okay.

315
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:52,019
Oh, quantum reading. Wait, this church cave shard, distress beacon. Wait, escape pod two.

316
00:56:52,659 --> 00:57:04,010
I already did that. Okay. Whatever. Can I get anywhere else here looking for, I need to explore

317
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:12,380
this tower again while this time. Watch out. This is how it's made, how they make a Snickers bar.

318
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:32,730
Yep. Don't minus two that one. That was a solid reference to like 20 minutes ago. How,

319
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,730
I can't believe I'm getting minused here. I can't fucking believe it.

320
00:57:45,929 --> 00:58:02,179
I got a tough, tough crowd tonight. I need to, I need a reader reader. I need one of those wall

321
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:22,920
readers. There's a wall reader. I need a wall reader. Wait, is there a reader in here?

322
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:39,699
I think this door is sealed up. It is. I gotta get here another way. What about the bottom here?

323
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:51,639
All right, here we go. I have a reader here. Have I read this one? Sometimes,

324
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:55,400
past, since I checked in with you, Pi, how are you an idea of progressing at the sun station?

325
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,360
So, my plan will either fail explosively or succeed explosively.

326
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,519
Why, you know, I don't find that funny. Hypothesis time spent away from the station

327
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:12,070
would be beneficial to you both. I'm immensely interested in testing your hypothesis. Yeah,

328
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:22,179
that at least we can agree on. I'm curious. Remy thinks I'm Remy thinks I'm a gas.

329
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:25,300
I don't recall requesting that you monitor this conversation.

330
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:41,719
Why is this so loud? Why is the sand so loud in this room in particular? I don't see what state

331
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:46,199
of matter you're you are has to do with this. And I don't recall supporting the sun station's

332
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:52,860
construction. But here we are. I did have some new info there. All right, with my take this out.

333
00:59:53,659 --> 01:00:04,539
See what this one says. All right, what's this? Friends visiting from the hanging city. We are

334
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:09,579
planning the ash twin project at the high energy lab on Ember twins equator. Yes.

335
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:15,800
I became lost on Ember twin. My gratitude that Remy found me but the high energy lab is the

336
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,440
building with the large solar panels. I'm surprised I didn't see it. I already went in it though.

337
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,639
Imagine our otherwise immensely clever Konoi would lose his own head if it weren't for

338
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:35,530
automatically impossible. I already went into the higher energy lab didn't I? Two large solar panels.

339
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:46,260
Wait a minute. Are these quantum cactuses? All right, is this like a flappy bird experiment here?

340
01:00:46,260 --> 01:01:05,719
Can I get in here? Can I float in there? Oh, fuck it is. It actually is. It actually is.

341
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:12,360
No, no, no. Patch it. Patch it. Patch it. Come on. No. I thought you guys are bullshitting me.

342
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:21,820
Oh, come on. I can't believe that you actually can do that. Wow. All right. I didn't I didn't

343
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:31,000
know it was that far. Shit. Okay. What is up there? Now I need to know what's up there.

344
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:42,280
Now I need to know what's up there. Damn it. I can't believe I didn't get up there.

345
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:49,320
Oh, that's so sad. What's inside that? I don't know. That's what I need to know. I'm going back.

346
01:01:50,199 --> 01:02:15,059
Shit. Why did Omega Low get removed? Did it? What do you mean Omega Low? Oh, you're doing the thing

347
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:21,219
where everyone now has to write it because that's so stupid. Everyone's gonna write it now. Wait,

348
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:24,340
why did Omega Low get removed? And everyone's like, wait, did it? Let me check.

349
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:42,949
I gotta check. That's the oldest trick in the book, too. Where am I going? Just use autopilot.

350
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:51,989
It's the safest way as long as there's no sun. Autopilot's going a little fast.

351
01:02:52,869 --> 01:03:16,119
I'm not doing this. Let me get back. Let's go. Come on. Oh, what the fuck?

352
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:48,550
Good branding. Did I miss anything else on this? What? Oh, shit. Is there nothing else on this

353
01:03:48,550 --> 01:04:06,489
planet that I can't see? Sweat check? Not at all, actually. Zero. I'm good to go. I went,

354
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:18,199
remember I did this and I went, oh. And then I went this way. Something over here. What is this?

355
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:35,559
Is this like buried? This is probably a ship or something. It's coming out. Oh, the more the sand

356
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:50,340
drops, the surface goes down right. Okay, that's interesting. I didn't know that was happening.

357
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,219
It took him 10 hours to notice that. That's like the second time I've been on this planet.

358
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:28,789
Yeah, it took me 10 hours to notice. I've been here twice. I'm almost out of fuel.

359
01:05:30,889 --> 01:06:03,019
Uh, give me, give me, I'm give, watch out, don't get in there. Now it's on the other planet. Fuck,

360
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:14,059
come on, man. Come back to me. Why does it happen to me all the time? Oh, well. Just don't use that

361
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:24,059
much fuel. Jump over to it. No. There ain't shit on this whole planet. Look at all the ground I've

362
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:50,820
covered on the map. There's nothing even here. It's because, it's because I have to wait, so I

363
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:56,179
can't, I should, I shouldn't, I should never come here immediately. Because the sand is too high.

364
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:10,489
I can't do anything. Let's just ski around the planet. But not too far. Okay, here we go.

365
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:25,860
Going over here. Okay, here we are again. Back at the North Pole. All right, let's go this way.

366
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:46,789
Save the fuel. Well, I mean, this, this whole run is just a wash anyways. Not if you're good.

367
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,250
All right, here we go. So right in the equator is where this is.

368
01:07:53,639 --> 01:08:12,570
Is this where the cactus trap is? What is this? Oh, this shit's getting revealed now too. Wait,

369
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:18,630
can I, can I go in this window? I can. All right, so is there anything up here that I need to

370
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:30,039
look at? What's up here? Have I been up here? No, I've been here, yeah. This is where that is.

371
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:40,359
Fuel's almost gone. All right, so how long have I been walking around on this planet?

372
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:45,029
So don't ever come here unless it's been at least like five to ten minutes.

373
01:08:45,989 --> 01:09:02,340
All right, here's the cactus room. No fuel for the cactus room. Well, where is this on the map?

374
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:09,560
I know that there's no fuel here. Somebody left it in the corner. Oh, we're dead. So it might as

375
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:28,649
well just end it. All right, that's right in the equator. I'm going to land the ship there after

376
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:32,729
I do something else in like 10 minutes because that's how long it takes for that building to

377
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:58,899
show. I'm going to go back to what I was doing before. Back into the canyon. Try to find this

378
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:11,220
sunless city. Sunless city. Yes, the Ashtron project was planned at the high energy lab,

379
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,579
a building with large solar panels on Emperor Twin's equator. Yes,

380
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:32,229
it can only be accessed by a path from the sunless city. Do a third cactus in a row. Let's go. No,

381
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:38,649
I'm not going to do that. I've been to the city once already. I just don't remember. It was just

382
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:43,779
in game time. I just don't remember. I had there was that sign that I saw to

383
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:24,699
mark it on the map. Rhinoceros beetle brain. That's a very, that's incredibly specific animal.

384
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:43,739
Why a rhinoceros beetle? That's very specific. Let's go. So I'm looking for,

385
01:11:44,699 --> 01:12:04,939
what am I looking for again? Not there. Up here, right? Is that staircase?

386
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:28,569
That's there. No, please put me back in. Put me back in quick. Put me back in quick. Put me back

387
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:39,819
in quick. Put me back in. Oh my God. No. Why couldn't I go back in? Oh my fuck. I'm so mad

388
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:49,850
right now. You have no idea. You have no idea. I'm so fucking mad. Why couldn't I come back? Why

389
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:58,380
wouldn't it put me back in? Why wouldn't it put me back in? Fuck. I'm so mad. I can't believe it.

390
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:14,060
No suit. No suit. One. Cactus two. Sun zero. We're on a roll tonight. We're on a roll,

391
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:18,460
ladies and gentlemen. A roll, I tell you. God damn it. What a pain in the ass.

392
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:29,159
Put the suit on. Why can't I just permanently be in the suit? And I tried, I instantly fucking knew

393
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:33,800
and I tried. Instantly. Instantly. Within an instant to get back in. It didn't work.

394
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:59,460
I can't, apparently you have to have the suit on to get beamed up. God. Sun zero. Oh, I'm so mad.

395
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,939
All right. Settle down. Settle down. I'm just gonna go back to that thing. I'm so angry.

396
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:16,260
Like, I'm not even, I'm not comedy angry right now. I'm like, pissed off angry. You know, there's

397
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:24,489
like comedy angry and there's like fucking, I'm like mad. I think I crossed the comedy

398
01:14:24,489 --> 01:14:34,329
anger threshold right now. Okay. Put your stupid suit on. I love how I could, I have to put the

399
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:40,170
suit on, but I can't take the suit off. Like in space. Just, why can't I just rip the helmet off?

400
01:14:41,210 --> 01:15:02,699
I got it on. So this is, this is the lab, right? Can I get anywhere from here? I don't know. Did

401
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:11,340
I fully explore this place? Eight pod two. Yeah. Let's get pod three. We already looked at this.

402
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:32,069
We did already see this. Just making sure I don't miss anything. We've already seen this. Okay.

403
01:15:33,289 --> 01:15:46,789
Ah, enormous cavern. Yup. Long shelter. Wait, hold on. Shelter site. Where's the big scary thing?

404
01:15:47,350 --> 01:16:07,510
I have to investigate that. It was this way. No, this is the oxygen place. Wait, do I have

405
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:22,340
to go through this again? Where's the monster? Okay. It's this one, right? Yeah. Right. Okay.

406
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:49,640
This can be investigated more. I can drop down from somewhere into here. All right. Let's go.

407
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:11,930
Found a shortcut hole. I already did. Did I find the shortcut hole already? Wait, very early on.

408
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:21,079
I did. What? You found a shortcut yesterday out here. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Yeah. Out

409
01:17:21,079 --> 01:17:28,810
here. You are. No, you're right. I did out. Yeah. I think I know what that is. I think it's out

410
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:41,180
around here, isn't it? It's somewhere like out here. Didn't I, I poked my head out or something.

411
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:52,659
It's like, it was like digging up in Minecraft. Where was it? I distinctly remember that happening

412
01:17:52,659 --> 01:18:18,489
for some reason. I don't remember where it was though. Oh, what the hell was that? I don't

413
01:18:18,489 --> 01:18:22,010
remember. I just really don't. There's so much information in this game. I have no idea where

414
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:39,510
that is. Let me refuel. Ugh. I do remember though, like poking my head out somewhere

415
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:51,779
or being like, oh, here I am. I think it's not like right around here or something, right?

416
01:18:52,659 --> 01:19:18,329
I don't, I have no idea. Not a single clue. It's like a shortcut. I don't know. I don't know.

417
01:19:26,579 --> 01:20:13,289
I don't know. Don't look at the VOD. Okay. It's right there.

418
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:26,119
But where do I go from? I'm going to pull my fucking. I can't wait. This is, didn't I open this?

419
01:20:27,079 --> 01:20:42,939
This is not it. That's not it. I didn't open that. No. Damn it. Let me try going this way.

420
01:20:43,899 --> 01:21:11,770
Be down here. What's that? Where's the sand? No. Wait. Big bits came in. Oh shit. They did.

421
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:21,909
Daddy Umbra gave 10,000 bits. Thanks for the a hundred dollars. And is this like a,

422
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:26,229
what is it? E-mode? What is this E-mode? PJ salt. I thought that was a toilet.

423
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:36,729
Uh, thanks for the 10,000 bits, dude. Uh, they say my socks were hard to put on today. Thanks a lot,

424
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:40,869
Jeremy. Did you just get out of the shower and then try to put your socks on? What a mistake that

425
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:51,180
was. That was the biggest mistake. You gotta be more careful. But thanks for the a hundred dollars.

426
01:21:51,899 --> 01:22:01,079
That's a shitload of money. Thanks for the fucking massive, massive money drop.

427
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:12,789
Putting on socks while your feet are wet is impossible. And then we just had five community

428
01:22:12,789 --> 01:22:15,670
subs too from Super Bruce. Thank you, Super Bruce. I've no idea. Tell me where to go. I don't care.

429
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,939
Like literally tell me where to go. I'm never going to find this. You know I won't.

430
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:38,890
I will never find this. He doesn't care. I mean, I'm not, I'm not going to find,

431
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:46,199
I'm not going to remember where this is. You got like 10 planets, 60 locations on each planet.

432
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:52,520
That's 600 locations. And then you got like on each 600 locations, you got 20 dialogue options.

433
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:56,039
We're talking about like 12,000 places in my brain. I don't know where they are.

434
01:22:56,439 --> 01:23:16,600
Okay. Go to the gravity cannon. Is that even on this planet? Is the gravity cannon even on this

435
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:29,939
planet? Let me go with my ship. Let me go to the ship. Let me go to the ship. You're already out

436
01:23:29,939 --> 01:23:53,300
of time. So it's the gravity cannon. Where's that fucking gravity cannon? That's the thing.

437
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:58,039
That's like the broken thing. Yeah. I think I know what it looks like. I just don't know where it is.

438
01:23:58,039 --> 01:24:10,260
Okay. There it is. So this, this, this, the Dark Souls shortcut was here.

439
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:15,460
The shortcut was here. I never would have found this. No way. Not in a thousand years.

440
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:27,399
I never would have remembered it. You just saved like at least an hour or two of this stream.

441
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,720
Thank you guys. Another hundred dollars from Daddy Umbra. 10,000 more bits.

442
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:42,680
$200 total down in bits from Daddy Umbra. Jerma, make a joke or I'll send more.

443
01:24:44,760 --> 01:25:01,579
What? Make a joke or I'll send more. Why don't I just be quiet? You just told

444
01:25:01,579 --> 01:25:05,739
me if I don't say anything that's worth it, then you'll have more money.

445
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:17,699
Well, make it so you don't spend any more money. I don't even have a joke right now.

446
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:22,020
I don't have anything to say. I'm desperately trying to find this city.

447
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:44,100
What's this? This is the, okay, I remember this is the quantum cactus.

448
01:25:44,979 --> 01:26:03,909
No quantum cactus here. Wait, can I close this? Damn it. Is it further down? Is it all the way down?

449
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:34,060
No, this dude is crazy. Above the door. Like, you mean up there? Like not even going in the cannon?

450
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:51,189
It's above the door to like up here. I never would have found this. Never. Never would have found it.

451
01:26:52,420 --> 01:27:05,260
Never would have found it. All right, remember where this is. How do I mark this? Found it last

452
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:16,220
stream. Yeah, and that's fine. But I've also found a lot of other things last stream. Yeah,

453
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:21,859
I need like a team of 10 people to be all have a different planet in their brain. I got to hire

454
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:29,539
people to remember what happened on each planet. You're the Brittle Hollow Guy. Oh, wait, hold on.

455
01:27:29,539 --> 01:27:49,210
This is important. There's no ghost over there. Ghost right there though. Okay, I'm going to go

456
01:27:49,210 --> 01:28:20,229
that way. What? All right, now let's go there. Okay, made it. Yeah, this fills with sand.

457
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:25,029
This is already filling with sand. Just remember what that was. Big cannon right above the door.

458
01:28:36,739 --> 01:28:43,609
Yeah, okay, I can come here later. I'm gonna come here immediately, go right to the cannon,

459
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:53,619
go right in. You got to get here insanely fast. Yeah, I will. Now I remember where this is.

460
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:59,380
It's not gonna take me 100 years to get here. Just I'm gonna break my fucking neck on the ceiling.

461
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:28,119
The sand and the neck breaking is the loudest sounds in the whole game. Daddy Umbra again,

462
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:41,859
you're at $250 worth of bits. 25,000 bits. Derma, do you love us? I love the end. I love this whole

463
01:29:41,859 --> 01:29:51,350
community. I think everybody's great. Well, I love each individual, every single individual one of

464
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:57,989
you. Now that I cannot say. I don't know you individually. I know you collectively as a group.

465
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:10,390
I don't know. It could be a serial killer watching right now. You know, I can't make that kind of

466
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:27,899
statement. All right, let's do it. I got the suit on. I know where I'm going. One of you could be

467
01:30:27,899 --> 01:30:33,739
embezzling millions of dollars into like offshore bank accounts or something. Like I can't say that

468
01:30:44,729 --> 01:31:04,659
through donations. All right, let's get in there quick. But no, I love this community.

469
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:08,739
I love this place. I love this space here. I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's great.

470
01:31:09,539 --> 01:31:30,859
All right. Where's that cannon? Where's that cannon? Where's the cannon? Cannon, cannon,

471
01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:36,619
cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon, where's that cannon?

472
01:31:37,579 --> 01:32:19,689
What's that? I've ever seen that. No, focus. Here we go. Nice. Nice, dude. Nice. Okay, let's go.

473
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:25,289
Gee, I'm so fucking nervous right now. God. Shake, shake around a little bit.

474
01:32:26,489 --> 01:32:35,609
Move. Ah, fuck. Okay. No, fuck. I'm okay. Go down here. Ah, okay. Slow down. All right,

475
01:32:35,609 --> 01:32:45,109
we got we have some info anglerfish overlook district stepping stone district high energy

476
01:32:45,109 --> 01:32:58,119
lab trailhead eye shrine district knowledge should we build the sun station to power the astron

477
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:04,859
project are there other ways to generate this level of power theoretically yes practically

478
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:09,659
no i can't imagine discovering them in our lifetimes i understand this proposal is unsettling

479
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:15,579
but the sun station must be built we have to complete the project i almost can't comprehend

480
01:33:15,579 --> 01:33:20,380
this is being suggested seriously the purpose of the sun station goes against every standard

481
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:24,460
we hold ourselves to and everything we believe in as a species i know what happens in the game

482
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:29,739
i figured out the story unsurprisingly i disagree we're pushing a possible new technology further

483
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:37,699
than ever before they tap into the sun with the sun station and they do this fucking weird they're

484
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:41,859
trying to make a new energy source or they're trying to go forward in time or backwards in

485
01:33:41,859 --> 01:33:45,220
time and they use the power from the sun which makes the sun supernova putting into a time

486
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:50,340
that's the sun explodes because they tapped into it i get it if we fail and probably the

487
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:59,529
we would question destroy ourselves in our life here potential annihilation of an entire star

488
01:33:59,529 --> 01:34:03,850
system is too severe we shouldn't build the sun station but if you were going to build one where

489
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:09,210
would it be your failure is a poor reason not to try i believe if we're cautious the sun station

490
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:15,689
will work look i'm deeply honored i comprehend your position if we aren't all but certain

491
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:19,210
it will not cause destruction once we built it then i won't support the station's use

492
01:34:20,409 --> 01:34:32,260
all right now what these are oh wait what's down here

493
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:56,140
high energy lab yeah all right hold on all right sand's coming sand's coming sand's coming let's

494
01:34:56,140 --> 01:35:10,819
go i can teleport okay i'm gonna come back here every day what else is in here i follow the trail

495
01:35:10,819 --> 01:35:40,699
i guess i guess we're gonna follow this um okay can't do that um can i was i too did i take too

496
01:35:40,699 --> 01:36:03,960
long is there a place i can jump through oh shit hold on wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i might

497
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:16,010
die is gonna crush my head this is gonna crush my head can i actually do this i'm gonna try all right

498
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:33,500
if it's a failure don't matter i'm gonna teleport back anyways come on hurry up does this actually

499
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:51,130
go over the lip what ceiling is far away okay now i'm gonna go one two three go really really

500
01:36:52,729 --> 01:37:18,729
really keep going what what no what hold on wait go this way oh no go go go quick oh

501
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:39,739
oh i thought i did it where the hell am i oh my goodness where am i going uh keep following this

502
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:53,800
trail oh wait what's over here don't go in it yet three minutes till oxygen explodes what but

503
01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:17,930
this stuff over here is there anything over here all right not worth it i'm going up huh what where

504
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:46,279
am i going where am i going um oh oh go go go why into that oh all right i did it i think i did it

505
01:38:46,279 --> 01:38:53,340
or something oh shit i did it okay i made it what do i do what's this thing what's that do

506
01:38:54,340 --> 01:39:04,140
what are these are these special these special buttons warp core warp core warp core how many

507
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:10,100
different warp cores are there is there a secret this gotta be like a hold on this is probably

508
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:14,939
gonna be like i open a door or something come on like this guy i've got i have to be able to open

509
01:39:14,939 --> 01:39:21,460
a door break this glass can i shatter the glass read record show nomai arriving at the warp

510
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:26,920
receiver umbrella hollow very slightly poor departing on the white house station i mean

511
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:33,659
i are devising an experiment to test if this is real phenomena or simply machine error initial

512
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:39,340
things first our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white

513
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:51,430
hole core to mimic the setup on the white hole station clown brain setup will first pair a small

514
01:39:51,430 --> 01:40:00,220
black hole with a small white hole it is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering

515
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:07,539
the corresponding black hole in theory what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount

516
01:40:07,539 --> 01:40:12,899
of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its

517
01:40:12,899 --> 01:40:27,930
destination what the fuck are you talking about man an update our experiment here reproduced the

518
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:35,609
anomaly in arrival and departure times but pi is unconvinced but it's more than an equipment error

519
01:40:35,609 --> 01:40:44,010
i hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes for that end we

520
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:48,970
decided to try adding more energy i imagine the sunless city's energy supply should prove sufficient

521
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:59,720
all available energy has been rerouted from the way to have room to our experiment rami and i are

522
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:08,779
about to run a new test hypothesis confirmed hypothesis confirmed i saw it i saw it hypothesis

523
01:41:08,779 --> 01:41:20,520
confirmed is this a germa stream we just said the same thing four times in a row this is beyond

524
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:25,239
extraordinary this changes everything what a beautiful day for the intersection of abstract

525
01:41:25,239 --> 01:41:34,500
theory and practical application of note rami yarrow requests that we let him know before we

526
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:45,210
reroute energy to the experiment hypothesis train i'd hate to leave him in the dark new info okay

527
01:41:45,210 --> 01:42:08,340
now the question is oh there's a press this button what did i just do we're at full power

528
01:42:08,979 --> 01:42:17,180
oh man there's more the southern observatory is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is

529
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:23,340
possible that is to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the

530
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:36,380
warp that's just enough time for germa to do an interview we've learned the negative interval

531
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:40,699
of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core

532
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:47,479
problematically the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate

533
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:53,659
creating a 22 minute long interval is possible but we can't are currently unable to generate

534
01:42:53,659 --> 01:43:03,939
the necessary energy the energy is currently unavailable you say you're a gas pie i mean i

535
01:43:03,939 --> 01:43:08,899
believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy a thrilling but enormous

536
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:12,659
undertaking we would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy

537
01:43:13,779 --> 01:43:23,319
anyway we're getting we're getting to you know you watch the first six episodes of the anime

538
01:43:23,319 --> 01:43:27,720
and you go wow this is actually pretty interesting shit i this is cool and then you're at like the

539
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:33,100
middle 10 episodes of the anime and it just kind of goes off the rails in your head and they add a

540
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:44,329
bunch of shit and i don't like season two turns it upside down oh wait hold on i said the word anime

541
01:43:44,329 --> 01:43:56,619
i forgot sorry about that my pun was unintended ramiya so i believe it's you who's uh error form

542
01:43:57,180 --> 01:44:02,739
all right don't ever say the word anime someone will be very angry with you

543
01:44:03,699 --> 01:44:14,920
it's like it's like just an automatic reaction you could be eating a bowl of macaroni and cheese

544
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:28,680
and if you hear the word anime some of you guys it's like how dare you the ashtron project will

545
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,989
be one of our biggest undertakings metaphorically and physically to build it we need a way to travel

546
01:44:33,989 --> 01:44:46,340
quickly between ash twin and each location that holds crucial project materials you just got

547
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:59,180
punched in the stomach uh i can't laugh that hard because it's hurting me but that's funny

548
01:44:59,739 --> 01:45:10,300
give that guy a fucking goal i wish i could give gold stars twitch has the vip system but that's

549
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:16,460
like kind of too much i just i want like a temporary a temporary like that i can put on someone

550
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:24,069
that only lasts like 30 minutes because if you vip somebody's like oh that's a very important

551
01:45:24,069 --> 01:45:29,590
person for the stream you don't like remove the vip i want a system where i can like place a

552
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:35,350
dunce cap on them raya and be like you just you said i like what you said it's like a 10 minute

553
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:46,340
thing dunce cap and then their text is kind of is lit up for like five minutes that would be kind

554
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:56,649
of fun that's like what channel points is but without me giving it to you the time is frozen

555
01:45:56,649 --> 01:46:01,430
right yeah the ashtron project will be one of our biggest undertakings yeah we need to travel

556
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:06,489
quickly between ash twin and each location that holds crucial project materials this is the sixth

557
01:46:06,489 --> 01:46:11,609
location what if we used warp towers like the one we have on the white hole station to connect each

558
01:46:11,609 --> 01:46:19,479
planet directly to ash twin folk root and i can begin work on this immediately in the black hole

559
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:29,350
forge where is it each tower on ash twin will warp to a different planet each tower on ash twin will

560
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:34,810
warp to a different planet we can design each tower to visually reflect its warp destination

561
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:45,979
okay the giant's deep tower for instance could resemble a cyclone and we could add trees to the

562
01:46:45,979 --> 01:46:55,979
timber hearth tower yeah so it's like a sham it's their towers they're not even they're not planets

563
01:46:55,979 --> 01:47:06,340
they're towers you don't get you don't travel to the fucking i mean they add they added trees in it

564
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:24,229
to make you think that wait did i do this one yet oh wait wait wait what is this six here one two

565
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:41,880
three four five hell all right i just opened it this better be open from now on this door will need

566
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:49,699
to remain closed for some time behind you lab is now being used to design the twa or project

567
01:47:51,560 --> 01:48:03,420
your area you use the sound of the city we got it yeah we got it now what am i supposed to do in

568
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:07,819
here wait where is this on the map so i don't i can actually remember where the hell this is

569
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:17,460
it's okay it's where the big tower is the big um like paper mache tower kind of up uh

570
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:35,590
uh right above the equator and the northern side okay let's go down here so uh what we got

571
01:48:35,590 --> 01:49:16,569
what can i do turn this on okay black hole white hole black hole white hole oh black hole white

572
01:49:16,569 --> 01:49:47,939
hole okay close it up wait what's that what we're looking at okay that's what all right that was

573
01:49:47,939 --> 01:50:14,260
weird what about uh two black holes about white hole black hole what does it do okay so what about

574
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:38,779
black hole and nothing black hole nothing is there what am i supposed to do so if you go into a

575
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:48,170
black hole you come out of the white hole what do two white holes do anything okay do i is this do

576
01:50:48,170 --> 01:51:09,539
i need to do anything about this yeah okay so you go in you come out right okay is there anything

577
01:51:09,539 --> 01:51:28,039
i'm supposed to do in here put it back in put it back in put it back in put it back in

578
01:51:39,960 --> 01:52:13,989
you destroyed the fabric of spacetime this is a joe credit sequence right you got the kazoo ending

579
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:27,210
no i don't want the kazoo ending i want the real one the one that people talk about that's

580
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:44,390
i don't want the kazoo ending no i can load it right i can load the save and do it

581
01:52:44,390 --> 01:53:20,359
what the fuck did that just say load previous save thank god did i learn all that info what's

582
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:32,539
what's the previous i didn't learn anything no i did okay i saved it high energy lab and then ash

583
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:45,140
wind tower designs ash twin tower designs okay so that's now that connects to here

584
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:51,479
statue island connects to here high energy lab connects to here black hole forge don't know where

585
01:53:51,479 --> 01:54:05,029
it is we've almost what is this probe tracking module what the fuck looks like the modules

586
01:54:05,029 --> 01:54:13,590
underwater oh the thing that shoots out of that ship in the very beginning is the tracking module

587
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:25,800
which lands on giants deep which is what's in the center of giants deep interesting

588
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:34,649
what else have i not done here southern observatory i signal locator on brittle hollow

589
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:41,399
hole there is a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory the trailhead starts

590
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:47,539
at brittle hollow's equator bribeck says you can't get into the observatory from the surface

591
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:51,939
but there's probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere there's a door to the

592
01:54:51,939 --> 01:55:01,939
observatory on the surface but it's broken brittle hollow path in the equator let's go boys and girls

593
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:27,239
let's go i can't believe i got the kazoo ending brittle hollow equator brittle hollow into the

594
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:47,590
equator let's go bye please can we get hyped i turned off hype trains that don't exist anymore

595
01:55:47,590 --> 01:56:06,100
on this channel dude you ready to get scammed i can't even turn it on i think this i think

596
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:15,380
the broadcast has to be off before i can turn it on all right we need to get to the equator

597
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:24,619
there's a path leading to this observatory going a little too fast all right let's land

598
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:39,989
walk out there i only don't it because i want to see hype trains i want to refund

599
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:45,350
look we could just pretend that it's on right now okay so there's a path on this equator okay

600
01:56:45,350 --> 01:57:08,310
ready train stop i'm not seeing i'm not seeing any hype you know we're not even at level zero

601
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:23,319
all right well two people just got banned so uh that's like that's like two dollars

602
01:57:23,319 --> 01:57:34,710
all right two people got banned so that's all right hype it up freeze detected is this it

603
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:46,390
now this is the uh no this is it this is it the trees are moving the trees are moving the tree

604
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:53,369
everything's moving yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep need to go to the equator gotta go

605
01:57:53,369 --> 01:57:58,170
to the equator go to the equator equator equator when you find a path on the equator

606
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:05,960
here wait a minute can i get in from here the door is broken right is the door even down here

607
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:25,350
all right hold on this goes this i remember this part confused me this was very confusing to me

608
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:43,850
up let's try and see what's up here dude what do you give me a break i might be going this fast

609
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:17,579
there's uh what's his name over there bribeck for sure wait he welcomed in this place above

610
01:59:17,579 --> 01:59:23,579
you stands the tower quantum knowledge if you are making your first pilgrimage to the quantum

611
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:27,819
moon ascend these stairs and obtain the last of the knowledge you need for your journey

612
01:59:29,880 --> 02:00:27,699
really the final clue the final hint no no that didn't do shit i'm trying to willy wonka my way

613
02:00:27,699 --> 02:00:41,829
over there hold on what does this say crossroads all right turn it on all right look at this look

614
02:00:41,829 --> 02:00:47,109
at this sonic the hedgehog level three map give me a break i'm not gonna how am i gonna figure this

615
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:58,220
out i'm just whatever i'm just gonna go in hang on left bring it right bring it we're going left

616
02:00:58,939 --> 02:01:14,409
oh we're oh oh what happened hello move i just got hit in the head by a rock

617
02:01:18,569 --> 02:02:05,770
oh no what did i get hit in the head what the fuck is that what is that grab it what

618
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:12,140
i'm so confused what is that why is this what's this floating here for

619
02:02:12,939 --> 02:02:49,109
oh no this is okay this is the thing this is the thing yeah this is this place oh shit

620
02:02:58,819 --> 02:03:16,659
yeah yeah turn it on how do i turn this thing on dude stop doing quantum crack how do i turn

621
02:03:16,659 --> 02:03:23,720
this on you like press a and it you put you where is it something i have to do

622
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:34,600
yep yep you stand on the war platform on the floor and wait until the tower aligns with its

623
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:46,789
corresponding astro body brittle hollow look up while the station's rotating you see the

624
02:03:46,789 --> 02:04:04,979
alignment happens when the astro body's directly ahead yeah didn't i oh right i forgot i need to

625
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:37,050
do this like turn the damn thing on let's go all right where's my ship quantum crack quantum crack

626
02:04:38,920 --> 02:05:08,539
oh crack that may or may not exist oh i felt that one okay let's go try this shit again

627
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:24,069
um don't do that please game all right where is that special place to go down

628
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:28,470
sounds gonna explode yeah i know it is i learned some more stuff though didn't i

629
02:05:29,029 --> 02:06:12,520
this way can i wait can i that's too dangerous what is this have i been over this way before

630
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:24,979
yep this is that rock that disappearing rock i feel like i don't want to go do all this because

631
02:06:24,979 --> 02:06:40,060
i'm gonna run out of time i'm just gonna run out of time this has to be so dark whatever let's go

632
02:06:51,189 --> 02:06:58,060
pick something and stick with it i already i did i picked it i'm trying to figure out how to get

633
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:23,340
to this place in brittle hollow all right give me this thing check this out this doesn't want

634
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:44,729
move now this thing's not quantum i thought it was i can't take a photo of it because i'm observing

635
02:07:44,729 --> 02:08:10,489
it when it's on the photo oh whatever this is where i was last time i don't know where the hell

636
02:08:10,489 --> 02:08:21,460
am i even trying to get to down there all right no falling rock right not this time good all right

637
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:34,119
no gigantic falling crater good i have a minute but where am i going down there and then to the

638
02:08:34,119 --> 02:08:57,100
left back where power no this is just wrapped around and i kind of yeah no i'm above the black

639
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:25,979
hole there he is all right switch this up a little bit where am i trying to get to um to the left

640
02:09:25,979 --> 02:09:47,460
right now what uh what is what is this even for i have to be all right wait hey whoa it's falling

641
02:09:47,460 --> 02:10:13,340
all the way in i go with it all right well then his higher side is gone now do i have to be flying

642
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:32,340
with that thing when what about down there what is that uh this shit's upside down i don't know

643
02:10:32,899 --> 02:11:09,560
i really don't know can i flip this thing somehow and turn it upside down i gotta turn this whole

644
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:32,390
thing upside down how do i turn this upside down i'm gonna turn this upside down does this exist

645
02:11:32,949 --> 02:11:41,829
over here too let me observe all right hold on a second hold on a second that thing's moving

646
02:11:41,829 --> 02:12:05,100
no i'm moving now it's me that's moving it's me that's moving what hold on this whole thing

647
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:21,529
came apart can i stand on this okay wait now wait what's this doing here what is this thing doing

648
02:12:21,529 --> 02:12:29,529
here hold on wait wait wait hold on wait wait wait wait wait turn off the light turn lights off turn

649
02:12:29,529 --> 02:12:47,850
lights off turn lights off wait wait what does it say beneath your feet lies the tower of knowledge

650
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:55,220
can i go into this wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

651
02:12:55,220 --> 02:13:14,680
wait wait is this stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop slow down um

652
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:21,720
okay this is wait a minute that's the tower right there this is the tower of knowledge i was when i

653
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:31,319
already up there wait i this is the tower of knowledge this is the tower hold on can i go and

654
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:45,130
how much fuel do i have holy shit you gotta be fucking kidding me get up there it is it's the it's

655
02:13:45,130 --> 02:13:55,430
the this is the actual tower it's the thing all right i get it i get it i get it no i'm so bad at

656
02:13:55,430 --> 02:14:09,180
controlling flying around how high do i have to go all the way what's that over there no no no no go

657
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:34,979
all the way to the top pre-detected the fucking sun's gonna blow up let's just do quick read

658
02:14:34,979 --> 02:14:43,260
something read welcome so your arrival here means you've completed your profession as even you're

659
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:47,539
ready to try quantum moon on your pilgrimage quantum moon will carry you just as it carried

660
02:14:47,539 --> 02:14:50,819
me and many of my clan before me in the moon's sixth and most secret location and where is it

661
02:14:51,829 --> 02:14:55,909
you'll be aided in your pilgrimage by the shrine our clan built in the quantum moon but remember

662
02:14:55,909 --> 02:14:58,949
this is the final route to explore the sixth location the shrine must be on the moon's north

663
02:14:58,949 --> 02:15:16,869
pole be curious on your journey what about this one what do i do with this the north pole has to

664
02:15:16,869 --> 02:15:46,439
be on the north pole i already read this is there another one okay so wait what's this one i didn't

665
02:15:46,439 --> 02:16:10,180
read one piece of text just one piece of text one piece of text let's say if you're here then

666
02:16:10,180 --> 02:16:24,149
you mean that you made it too close oh shit all right the sixth location is you found the secret

667
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:43,020
of the sixth location the north pole of the quantum moon helps if you use at least two

668
02:16:43,020 --> 02:16:55,100
percent of your brain this is a game about not knowing a single fucking thing about anything

669
02:16:55,100 --> 02:17:06,629
just use your brain it's a mystery where you wake up every 20 minutes we've already determined

670
02:17:06,629 --> 02:17:29,690
there's like 1200 different locations if that guy had dunce cap i really want how do i get twitch to

671
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:36,139
like make a dunce cap and that's not a bad thing that's a good thing that's that's like a term of

672
02:17:36,139 --> 02:17:44,659
like that's for us that's we like that here power of quantum knowledge the sixth location

673
02:17:45,459 --> 02:17:53,100
okay the quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location many

674
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:57,020
know my went on a pilgrimage during which the quantum mood carried them to its sixth and most

675
02:17:57,020 --> 02:18:03,979
secret location to explore the sixth location the shrine on the moon must be on the moon's north

676
02:18:04,540 --> 02:18:24,780
pole let's go let's get to the moon hey it had a job interview and i got the job nice

677
02:18:25,739 --> 02:18:42,360
there's good work oh yeah you do that job as best as you can make that fucking money all right

678
02:18:42,360 --> 02:19:00,540
quantum flow where's the quantum what do you call that oh it disappeared make those bits make those

679
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:13,780
bits here was the singing moon come on so am i am i about to get to the here's the secret of the game

680
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:29,930
well that'd be interesting it is ready there literally right there dude come on it says i'm

681
02:19:29,930 --> 02:19:58,700
going to the secret location i'm going very fast but it's very far away so we just got to

682
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:03,739
get this thing on the moon on the north pole so i have to make it disappear and reappear till

683
02:20:03,739 --> 02:20:33,620
it's on the north pole and then open up the fucking elevator he doesn't understand velocity no i just

684
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:55,659
want to get there i just want to go to this location as fast as possible okay moon i'm ready

685
02:20:55,659 --> 02:22:08,870
onto moon secret got to take a damn photo autopilot i can't autopilot to a thing that

686
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:41,079
doesn't exist okay here we are i first i i killed that guy again keep killing this guy all right

687
02:22:41,079 --> 02:23:00,739
north pole let's get it on the north pole i'm floating i'm floating so much all right is it

688
02:23:00,739 --> 02:23:09,909
on the north pole where is this thing it's okay it's on the south pole north pole there it is

689
02:23:10,790 --> 02:24:07,909
okay it is now on the north is that the north pole watch this shit close that fucking door north

690
02:24:07,909 --> 02:24:31,690
pole okay now i'm gonna take a picture of this all right close it okay here we go

691
02:24:33,559 --> 02:25:33,639
sixth location ah what's going on secret sixth location here it is oh fuck it's gone um uh what's

692
02:25:33,639 --> 02:25:48,059
even here uh that looks like a that's a suction cup is this like it is a suction cup over here

693
02:25:48,940 --> 02:26:14,379
there's a person why am i getting um castle griffin steed vibes right now okay hello

694
02:26:15,399 --> 02:26:35,540
soleno who are you we don't i can't do that i don't know what that means pick up identity stone

695
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:46,920
pick up you stone pick up eye of the universe stone pick up quantum moon stone pick up me stone

696
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:59,319
pick up explain stone how many powers do i get all right i want uh explain stone

697
02:27:08,459 --> 02:27:31,129
insert explain stone oh explain uh explain me i imagine your purpose here is the same as mine

698
02:27:31,129 --> 02:27:39,959
to learn about and to find the eye of the universe i'm unsure how you arrived here however perhaps

699
02:27:39,959 --> 02:27:47,290
you came from another star system as my clan originally did that wasn't very good explanation

700
02:27:49,299 --> 02:27:55,049
uh do do i have like three wishes or something how long do i get to do this for

701
02:27:55,049 --> 02:28:09,459
explain uh explain the eye of the universe please there is fundamental uncertainty throughout the

702
02:28:09,459 --> 02:28:15,059
universe normally this uncertainty is only observable on a very small scale as one approaches

703
02:28:15,059 --> 02:28:24,200
the eye however that uncertainty grows enormously the quantum moon probably exhibits macroscopic

704
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:29,559
quantum behavior because of its proximity to the eye shards that broke off from the quantum moon

705
02:28:29,559 --> 02:28:35,559
have a similar effect as i imagine you've seen elsewhere in this star system yeah i've seen them

706
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:41,239
conscious observation forces a quantum object to collapse to a single possibility

707
02:28:42,040 --> 02:28:49,239
but what would happen if a conscious observer somehow entered the eye itself over time this

708
02:28:49,239 --> 02:29:00,700
has become my clan's greatest question all right uh more more more stuff explain um explain you

709
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:14,389
explain you i need nine i need to explain you i am on my first pilgrimage to the quantum moon

710
02:29:14,389 --> 02:29:22,020
all know my and my clan make this journey when we come of age even though the eye cannot be reached

711
02:29:22,020 --> 02:29:26,260
from here the quantum moon remains special to us as it carries us nearer to the eye than any other

712
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:34,569
place we know i've journeyed here to be close to the eye while the eye is obscured from our site

713
02:29:34,569 --> 02:29:50,889
we can see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye in the sky above us all right and explain

714
02:29:51,450 --> 02:30:01,750
uh explain the quantum moon too let's get all info we can he keeps taking a selfie of us

715
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:09,819
all right have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet the shard looks the same as

716
02:30:09,819 --> 02:30:16,299
the quantum moon surface does now while at the eye from this we can reasonably infer the quantum

717
02:30:16,299 --> 02:30:23,350
moon's natural status as we see it now and that the eye is its primary location even the quantum

718
02:30:23,350 --> 02:30:29,190
moon is the eye's moon it's likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also

719
02:30:29,270 --> 02:30:33,590
exhibited by the eye itself quantum moon and its shards for instance are quantum

720
02:30:33,590 --> 02:30:39,989
thus the eye is likely also quantum quantum eyes quantum moon's eyes the eye of the quantum moon

721
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:44,469
quantum existence in fact this moon is probably quantum because its proximity to the eye made it

722
02:30:44,469 --> 02:30:48,469
quantum the same way the areas surrounding quantum shards that landed on other planets

723
02:30:48,469 --> 02:31:02,020
eventually became quantum so many quantum so the eye is making this quantum okay quantum within a

724
02:31:02,020 --> 02:31:16,200
quantum got it shards that land on other planets eventually became quantum too okay identify we

725
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:31,379
have explained everything so now let's identify me who the hell am i i've never met one of your

726
02:31:31,379 --> 02:31:38,040
kind before it's an honor to speak with you i particularly admire your four eyes okay there

727
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:42,120
are many questions i would ask if i could comprehend your language you have my gratitude for understanding

728
02:31:42,120 --> 02:32:01,879
mine chip log update i have four eyes but i don't know uh on a moon this is the quantum moon

729
02:32:01,879 --> 02:32:07,559
where we both are standing despite also orbiting other celestial bodies the quantum moon is the eye

730
02:32:07,559 --> 02:32:21,379
of the universe's moon all right identify identify identify you like what's your name oh you already

731
02:32:21,459 --> 02:32:31,879
told me i am solenum anomai my clan arrived in this star system before my birth and we now call

732
02:32:31,879 --> 02:32:43,260
it home what about identify the eye of the universe he's gonna be like i don't know what that is

733
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:56,090
because well that's what i'm looking for we are orbiting the eye of the universe now although we

734
02:32:56,090 --> 02:33:02,010
cannot see it only the quantum moon's reflection of it the eye is older than the universe itself

735
02:33:02,010 --> 02:33:17,510
and my clan believes it dwells in an extremely distant orbit around this star system wait i can

736
02:33:18,309 --> 02:33:31,850
watch you and eye of universe

737
02:33:37,450 --> 02:33:41,930
many of my clan have believed the eye called to us for a particular purpose i gotta keep track of

738
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:51,379
these when i was a child i used to believe the eye was maleficent they have lured my clan to the

739
02:33:51,379 --> 02:33:58,659
star system only to vanish from them so completely but i don't fear the eye anymore in fact it became

740
02:33:58,659 --> 02:34:03,860
my fondest hope to see the eye itself someday but i fear this may be beyond my reach you may

741
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:08,739
think i'm strange but i have a hypothesis that i may not be entirely alive perhaps my journey has

742
02:34:08,739 --> 02:34:25,770
reached its end you and okay we're doing you's now you and quantum moon like many of my clan

743
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:28,569
before me i journeyed here to see the quantum moon's reflection of the eye this is the closest

744
02:34:28,569 --> 02:34:34,809
to any of us have come to seeing the eye itself you and me you may think i'm strange but i have

745
02:34:34,809 --> 02:34:44,579
a hypothesis that be oh yes we already know that you are you and me want to go to dinner later

746
02:34:45,459 --> 02:34:59,479
what do you think you and me we do not have much connection you and i oh okay that's all right

747
02:34:59,479 --> 02:35:03,399
still this encounter feels special i hope you won't mind if i think you as a friend

748
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:20,149
that's okay all right yeah fine that's all right okay you and moon quantum friend zone

749
02:35:22,629 --> 02:35:29,190
you did i do them all you and explain no i did i did them all you and me you and the eye did i do

750
02:35:29,190 --> 02:35:36,870
them all this guy's probably so sick of writing this shit he's like all right man like how many

751
02:35:36,870 --> 02:35:58,700
times you want to write the same thing okay now let's do me okay me and i suppose you could reach

752
02:35:58,700 --> 02:36:04,229
the eye of the universe would you try to enter it what do you imagine the effects of a conscious

753
02:36:04,229 --> 02:36:16,360
observer might be um i don't know i just feel like whoa quantum moon and me is this your first

754
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:21,479
time on the quantum moon it's my first time if you've come here looking for answers i hope you

755
02:36:21,479 --> 02:36:31,209
find them okay me and you me and moon me and i didn't okay what else have you not done moon and

756
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:51,719
i right moon identify explain these are the two tenets of nomai philosophy to seek out and to

757
02:36:51,719 --> 02:37:06,440
understand is our way of living now we got to do uh moon and we got have i done them all

758
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:24,809
moon and i i've done them all i think yeah i've done them all oh all right now how do i tell

759
02:37:24,809 --> 02:38:03,959
this person like goodbye now what do we do uh i just walk by him all right what is there what

760
02:38:03,959 --> 02:38:07,159
else shall i explore a little bit more i think i should explore a little

761
02:38:07,159 --> 02:38:08,520
bit

762
02:38:18,579 --> 02:38:46,569
is that the was that the guy wait didn't i you killed him i took a photo of him i took a photo

763
02:38:46,569 --> 02:38:58,680
of him and killed him all right now this is here but i quantum murdered him he wasn't supposed to

764
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:14,040
be alive in this universe is her oh i quantum killed her should i go i think i got to go back

765
02:39:14,040 --> 02:39:24,329
and process this in the ship i need to process this info we didn't learn anything yes we did we

766
02:39:24,329 --> 02:39:41,139
learned that the moon is the eyes moon and it's an eye to go in where's that ship come on where's

767
02:39:41,139 --> 02:39:56,309
the ship spawn the ship already i've been here before watching these guys i'm about to stand

768
02:39:56,309 --> 02:40:15,739
on the clock wait this is maybe oh this is your ship this is your ship i found your ship i'm ready

769
02:40:15,739 --> 02:41:25,819
to leave what what is that it sucked into the black hole i um what's over here hold on there's

770
02:41:25,819 --> 02:41:34,790
something over i don't think i've been over here what is this the big bits came in daddy umbra

771
02:41:34,790 --> 02:41:45,379
another hundred dollars from daddy umbra thank you daddy umbra again for your insane contributions

772
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:59,670
you're fucking hundreds of dollars wait did i just quantum lock myself in wait i have some

773
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:06,569
shit here they say but seriously want to give back for all the years of entertainment

774
02:42:06,569 --> 02:42:10,389
and happiness you've given me and so many others keep being you you're an amazing person

775
02:42:13,670 --> 02:42:29,340
thank you daddy umbra happy you think that way thanks daddy because i said daddy umbra

776
02:42:30,459 --> 02:42:43,879
all right sun's coming in let me uh no but just fly to the sun who cares the sun hungers yeah i

777
02:42:43,879 --> 02:43:05,450
got a lot of info that i have to process it's probably the sun the eye of the universe is

778
02:43:05,450 --> 02:43:18,379
probably just the sun right that's probably what it is if i were to take a wild guess

779
02:43:19,420 --> 02:43:39,079
i'd say this this quantum moon is the sun's moon suns don't have moons this is a video game though

780
02:43:39,719 --> 02:44:02,090
it could okay so i i've learned too much and now a threat to the cosmic balance of the world right

781
02:44:03,209 --> 02:44:30,069
how do i use this info one of these times i'm not going to wake up

782
02:44:38,540 --> 02:45:07,059
all right ship time let's dump some knowledge all right sixth location is it quantum moon is the

783
02:45:07,059 --> 02:45:11,940
eye of the universe's moon at this location the quantum moon becomes a reflection of the eye

784
02:45:12,979 --> 02:45:17,620
the eye is likely the source of all macroscopic quantum phenomena in the solar system

785
02:45:18,739 --> 02:45:32,489
i still have a quantum signal on giant steve it's at the bottom of the ocean though i can't get in

786
02:45:32,489 --> 02:45:38,469
there the ash twin the nomai plan to construct technology capable of producing a 22 minute

787
02:45:38,469 --> 02:45:46,680
negative time interval on ash twin i gotta get in here black hole forward i don't know how to

788
02:45:46,680 --> 02:46:19,319
get in there either on ash twin still i don't know what that is ocean depths nomai on construction

789
02:46:19,319 --> 02:46:24,280
yard saw something sink beneath the underwater current which they previously thought was

790
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:36,860
impossible something sunk beneath the current what the hell was it this huge nomai city just

791
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:44,790
north of bribex campsite subsurface energy readings the shuttle's equipment heard strange

792
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:48,950
energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface two of the nomai located a fissure

793
02:46:48,950 --> 02:47:02,659
in the ice on the interloper sunward side they descended inside to investigate fissure in the ice

794
02:47:03,379 --> 02:47:28,899
on the interloper sunward side let's go sounds like a lead hey look it's coming over now

795
02:47:29,459 --> 02:47:53,530
fissure in the ice on the sun side that would be this side right side i'm currently going to

796
02:48:11,909 --> 02:48:19,479
we gotta go down is that it right there is that it right in the middle right in the middle of the

797
02:48:19,479 --> 02:48:48,809
ice cream cone what i thought the sun was farther away than that you and me both

798
02:48:49,930 --> 02:49:01,780
we both thought that exact same thing classic sun joke ah i love this streamer

799
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:12,250
i had autopilot on too as far as anything i was gonna be

800
02:49:27,639 --> 02:49:41,030
fucking bionic boomer adjustment that's complete what

801
02:49:46,469 --> 02:50:02,700
sitting here adjusting my like back brace and shit oh no i didn't do that whatever i

802
02:50:03,100 --> 02:50:12,979
uh i didn't even have the fucking controller in my hand you could even hear the straps moving

803
02:50:12,979 --> 02:51:04,889
with two hands fucking autopilot i'm just gonna do it myself suicidal autopilot

804
02:51:17,879 --> 02:51:34,440
okay let's coast bring it down like 300 don't plot a course through the sun

805
02:51:35,239 --> 02:51:42,969
i have okay if you use google maps to drive somewhere it doesn't drive you in a straight

806
02:51:42,969 --> 02:51:48,860
line through buildings why would it not the gps not be that sophisticated with space traveling

807
02:51:49,579 --> 02:52:01,670
all right right there right it's the one right in the middle it's right there up in there

808
02:52:02,229 --> 02:52:44,020
all right let's get on it where is this fissure in the ice how are we doing it's a maze it's

809
02:52:44,020 --> 02:53:07,620
not really a maze but it might need to melt okay here we go it's gonna melt the fuck was that

810
02:53:07,620 --> 02:53:13,739
what was that what was that what is that what was that was that like was that a snot bubble

811
02:53:13,739 --> 02:53:59,239
coming out of my mouth what was that what are these things melt here it comes shit easy ghost

812
02:53:59,239 --> 02:54:20,979
matter ghost matter there i can't go down this tunnel there's ghost shit in there oh man ghost

813
02:54:20,979 --> 02:54:38,040
nearby where i'm receiving much stronger energy readings now that we're beneath the crust

814
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:43,319
whatever it must whatever it is it must lie somewhere below closer to the comet center

815
02:54:43,879 --> 02:54:46,120
i'm starting to think it's more dangerous than we realized

816
02:54:47,319 --> 02:54:52,620
all right can you hear us yes but your voices are faint i fear we will lose communication entirely

817
02:54:52,620 --> 02:54:58,870
if you continue any deeper keep the shuttle warm for us clary will return the moment we

818
02:54:58,870 --> 02:55:02,889
identify the source of the energy readings i understand but be cautious both of you

819
02:55:03,850 --> 02:55:31,500
i think it's a ghost maze back up back up can i go just blow right through it

820
02:55:35,059 --> 02:56:06,940
i was sliding i couldn't go anywhere i couldn't even go back i was sliding forward well i couldn't

821
02:56:06,940 --> 02:56:22,010
just shot the probe but instead i don't know why i was panicking with the auto mode okay let's do

822
02:56:22,010 --> 02:56:44,459
that again she's got to be that far away now don't do autopilot i'm gonna drive right into the sun

823
02:56:49,639 --> 02:57:27,530
like why was i not i thought i was controlling it safe no get up first links

824
02:57:28,969 --> 02:57:50,360
i've got to cut it off you're already about to cross the sun here i want to be on the other side

825
02:57:50,360 --> 02:58:06,889
though autopilot what are you doing it's traveling kind of too fast i need to get in closer

826
02:58:06,889 --> 02:58:15,719
there why slow down what the fuck is going on slow down slow the fuck down autopilot just

827
02:58:15,719 --> 02:58:54,340
fucking almost screwed me what are you doing landed all right get in get in the fissure

828
02:58:54,899 --> 02:59:05,350
let's do this again all right cool this time i'm gonna try to not get killed by the ghost matter

829
02:59:06,389 --> 02:59:53,959
hola yo soy auto germa auto hello okay so i'm just curious what is it what else is down here

830
03:00:00,729 --> 03:00:16,549
launch mode interesting that just dumps you out there that doesn't do anything this one is bogus

831
03:00:16,549 --> 03:00:58,540
too what about this one okay what about this one yeah okay what about this one correct that one

832
03:00:58,540 --> 03:01:09,829
is correct is that a curiosity what about this one the one i already did okay it's this one this

833
03:01:09,829 --> 03:01:30,780
is the right one hey what's going on all right here we go there's two ways to go okay right

834
03:01:30,780 --> 03:02:07,379
right we're good okay that's a that's a big cave with it's still going it was like hovering down

835
03:02:07,379 --> 03:02:57,290
there how do i get down here up there oh be careful all right we got two what's this one go

836
03:02:57,290 --> 03:03:38,979
there um um ghost detected nearby where is this all right it's the don't go down the left oh my

837
03:03:38,979 --> 03:03:51,510
god are you fucking kidding me you're telling me that i have to do i have to shoot and let me

838
03:03:51,510 --> 03:03:57,079
just do hold on wait this this might not be as which one was it was right right then left

839
03:03:58,229 --> 03:04:11,270
and right oh oh it's already moving right that right then left and right i can't slow down

840
03:04:11,829 --> 03:04:30,709
oh yes i can i'm good and left it's left it's left right and then hold on is it left

841
03:04:30,709 --> 03:05:10,059
a good view what the fuck i go up oh my god i don't know which way which one of these

842
03:05:10,059 --> 03:05:28,680
not this one not this one is it this one which one is it and then right then left

843
03:05:29,399 --> 03:06:10,260
this is backwards i don't know where the fuck this is even going up there did i make it um

844
03:06:10,260 --> 03:06:31,319
i'm still the dead person down here holy shit wait i need my i need my thing i need i need to take

845
03:06:31,319 --> 03:06:47,819
photos can i read this the spirit the spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the

846
03:06:47,819 --> 03:06:51,579
energy readings no rather the source of what's within the stone i'm detecting some form exotic

847
03:06:51,659 --> 03:06:58,819
matter there's a lot to read for floating around the stone is muting our energy readings they

848
03:06:58,819 --> 03:07:06,579
should be 10 times what we're seeing at least hi i don't think we want this matter interacting

849
03:07:06,579 --> 03:07:10,659
with us as far as i can tell direct contact with it would almost be fatal don't touch it

850
03:07:11,620 --> 03:07:17,000
i've never encountered anything like this casing but it's all that's protecting us from what's

851
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:21,799
inside we're still of this matter is disturbingly volatile hi whatever the matter inside this stone

852
03:07:21,799 --> 03:07:26,920
casing is it's more than just profoundly unstable it's under tons of pressure look at this density

853
03:07:26,920 --> 03:07:33,819
scan i've never seen anything this is tightly compacted before this is orders of magnitude

854
03:07:33,819 --> 03:07:38,620
worse than i'd imagined if this stone were to rupture the lethal matter within would rapidly

855
03:07:38,620 --> 03:07:44,739
expand completely blanketing the star system almost instantaneously and the pressure is still

856
03:07:44,739 --> 03:07:53,479
building as the comet approaches this star system return to the shuttle right now the rest of our

857
03:07:53,479 --> 03:07:59,780
friends need to know they're in terrible danger leave your equipment and run what are you doing

858
03:07:59,780 --> 03:08:04,819
pie the more we know about this alien matter the better our chances of survival i will learn what

859
03:08:04,819 --> 03:08:16,950
i can hear go warn the others maybe they can construct shelter somehow now go don't touch it

860
03:08:16,950 --> 03:08:52,840
but that's death so i've made it there's nothing else down here touch it touch it touch i'm gonna

861
03:08:52,840 --> 03:09:32,260
touch it what's going on what's happening uh this doesn't do anything okay it's inside of this

862
03:09:33,459 --> 03:10:01,079
i can't i'm i'm dead this is causing the ghosts what the fuck is this that's where i came from

863
03:10:03,159 --> 03:10:18,090
okay well let's put it in the computer so that's the that's the source of the ghost matter i'm

864
03:10:18,889 --> 03:10:45,049
it's green is that what's causing the explosion is that i don't know put it in the computer

865
03:10:47,350 --> 03:10:54,040
ruptured core found two missing members of the nomai shuttle crewed near a large ruptured stone

866
03:10:54,040 --> 03:10:59,000
looks like it exploded from the inside nomai traced the storage strange energy readings to

867
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:04,680
a spherical stone casing filled with some form of exotic matter they determined the exotic matter

868
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:10,200
was both lethal and under extreme pressure if the stone were to rupture the exotic matter within

869
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:14,120
would rapidly expand completely blanketing the solar system almost so this is the explosion

870
03:11:15,319 --> 03:11:33,239
this is what's blowing up but the sun blows up that's not what happens okay yeah we well this

871
03:11:33,239 --> 03:11:50,659
is completed kind of it already blew up yeah so all right still have to do this still need to do

872
03:11:50,659 --> 03:12:12,059
this 22 minute course point sir for the ash twin finish reading what this this

873
03:12:14,840 --> 03:12:17,879
there are three nomai aboard the shuttle one of them stayed behind to keep the shuttle warm

874
03:12:17,879 --> 03:12:24,409
while the other two explored the interloper sorry the nomai who stayed behind lost contact with

875
03:12:24,409 --> 03:12:31,510
the other two after they descended below the interloper's surface okay yeah i pulled the

876
03:12:31,510 --> 03:12:41,159
their their ship nomai landed on the interloper not long after its arrival in the solar system

877
03:12:47,420 --> 03:12:52,059
all right i'm gonna i'm gonna head back to ash twin and see if i can figure out how to do any

878
03:12:52,059 --> 03:13:29,350
of this shit at ash twin give it a go now the question is what do i do that's the ultimate

879
03:13:29,350 --> 03:13:47,620
question of the game ash twin it's the sand one felt to figure out that that sun station right

880
03:13:47,620 --> 03:13:54,899
there how do i gotta get on that i have to get on the sun station too somehow i don't know how

881
03:13:54,899 --> 03:14:16,709
would i do so i need to find this thing on ash twin this usb storage tower thing remember

882
03:14:23,899 --> 03:14:58,860
how do i get in there you just go i know right i had it in me all along i just had to go

883
03:15:05,909 --> 03:15:25,579
why are you guys doing rhythm heaven all right see if i can find something to do here

884
03:15:46,360 --> 03:16:07,479
land okay find something to do here there's a tower the place to go i don't really have much

885
03:16:07,479 --> 03:16:34,340
info besides one of the poles maybe there's this big tower here now i wonder the more the sand

886
03:16:34,340 --> 03:16:47,639
drops is there going to be something else under here i don't think i've waited to see it's still

887
03:16:47,639 --> 03:17:07,590
dropping yeah i'm just gonna wait this is gonna reveal some giant satellite

888
03:17:26,180 --> 03:17:37,479
i didn't do it again did i where did it even go why does it have to keep happening i don't get it

889
03:17:39,260 --> 03:17:47,750
don't you have suction cups on the bottom of your fucking ship by now okay so this is that but here

890
03:17:47,750 --> 03:18:05,100
is okay here we go i've never waited this long what else is on is it keep going is there more

891
03:18:13,379 --> 03:18:31,559
is that it no it's still going it is still going jesus how big is this thing like this

892
03:18:31,559 --> 03:18:41,829
probably way it's something i can get in the middle or something let's see i'm gonna wait this out

893
03:18:42,549 --> 03:19:27,909
hold on let me just let auto out bear back yeah he wanted to leave the room so how much further

894
03:19:28,950 --> 03:19:34,950
like i have a question a question does does the planet run out of sand to a point where it's

895
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:48,950
just a core and there's nothing here i've never waited that long this just jumps all

896
03:19:48,950 --> 03:20:11,159
sand over here and then this becomes empty oh this is a giant 22 minute hourglass

897
03:20:21,780 --> 03:20:39,239
oh it takes 22 minutes and it's just it's just a timer but they called it the hourglass twins

898
03:20:39,239 --> 03:20:48,040
before yeah but i didn't realize that it was dumping all the sand and it was a 22 minute

899
03:20:48,040 --> 03:20:56,569
the 20 you die in 22 minutes why is it 22 minutes i knew that it was like oh the sand goes from here

900
03:20:56,569 --> 03:21:04,309
to there but but what's the point of why is this why is this 22 minutes of sand i'm gonna die out

901
03:21:04,309 --> 03:21:32,739
here with my ship oh right it's fucking gone this thing is huge i wonder if this is an entrance is

902
03:21:32,739 --> 03:21:59,719
it just an entrance what else has been revealed and this shit is getting bigger i've already seen

903
03:21:59,719 --> 03:22:15,510
this i can't really see now i've already been up there and over here there's one on both sides

904
03:22:16,549 --> 03:22:26,309
there's one on a north and a south pole they're just huge antennas is it oxygen in here

905
03:22:27,030 --> 03:23:09,190
yeah can i walk in it or anything is there oxygen in here somewhere hmm i'm really i want to see

906
03:23:09,190 --> 03:23:42,379
what's at the very bottom your ship is right over there it's not it's over there what else before i

907
03:23:42,379 --> 03:23:50,069
die coming like rocky oh fuck wait a minute what's this what is that what's this what's this what's

908
03:23:50,069 --> 03:24:36,489
this oh i thought that was part of the uh never mind the oxygen here oxygen oxygen wake up

909
03:24:40,219 --> 03:25:03,579
so all right every memory recorded by a nomai statue is translated to a corresponding storage

910
03:25:03,579 --> 03:25:11,500
version within ash twin okay ash twin you can't do anything on it until like 15 minutes have gone

911
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:24,540
by to go in the towers that hold those masks i could do this i still haven't figured this out

912
03:25:24,540 --> 03:25:36,489
either i'm gonna do the hanging city or i'm gonna try to go to the bottom of the ocean i have this

913
03:25:36,489 --> 03:25:51,639
as well i was trying to get here but i got to the fucking quantum moon thing ocean depths nomai

914
03:25:51,639 --> 03:25:55,159
on the construction you saw something sink beneath the underwater current which they previous

915
03:25:55,159 --> 03:26:01,459
thought was impossible well what's sunk there try just dive in going 5 000 miles per hour

916
03:26:13,350 --> 03:26:22,520
i'm just gonna drive straight to the planet as fast as i can and go and go into the water

917
03:26:24,069 --> 03:26:30,620
or should i try to drop something in there i wonder if i should i drop something dump something in

918
03:26:30,620 --> 03:26:54,420
there throw something in there i don't know tornado the tornado throws everything in the air but

919
03:26:54,420 --> 03:27:14,840
well i don't know if it'll throw the center in the air i wonder if i can tell i remember seeing

920
03:27:14,840 --> 03:27:43,879
inside of that room from one of those disk things i don't think i can go in there with the ship and

921
03:27:43,879 --> 03:27:52,709
dive that far i don't think it's gonna work i'm just gonna end up dying and have to redo flying

922
03:27:52,709 --> 03:28:31,319
across the galaxy again okay what else is even here that i've seen done that all right i have

923
03:28:31,319 --> 03:28:51,139
a question i have a question can i fly into the super tornado okay what if i fly straight down

924
03:28:51,139 --> 03:29:21,899
into the super tornado where is it let's do it i just did it i just did it i just did it i'm in

925
03:29:21,899 --> 03:29:47,850
the fucking middle of tornado i did it i can't believe that worked i actually cannot believe

926
03:29:47,930 --> 03:30:19,879
that that just worked found it this is like an elevator

927
03:30:29,510 --> 03:30:54,250
okay i can't fly up there the shard is inside of that though it's gotta be something i can

928
03:30:54,250 --> 03:31:01,110
clearly go and walk it just walk it don't even who cares about an elevator let's go

929
03:31:02,069 --> 03:31:34,969
now this is the last shard right pieces he welcomed in this place this tower shares with

930
03:31:34,969 --> 03:31:38,489
all who asked the knowledge needed to make his or her first quantum journey

931
03:31:39,690 --> 03:31:48,489
i feel like i'm coming here a little late this would be my probably 30th quantum journey so far

932
03:31:52,540 --> 03:32:20,040
oh let's go up enter this place without friends however these are lessons to learn for yourself

933
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:46,309
okay keep going up oh can i keep going up i should i'm going in the middle just want to make sure i

934
03:32:46,309 --> 03:33:08,010
don't miss anything all right i'm gonna go down this is gonna kill me seek the wandering arch i

935
03:33:08,010 --> 03:33:20,469
know this shit all right before we get into this what we're gonna i gotta pee i gotta pee real bad

936
03:33:21,670 --> 03:36:06,620
i will take our actual first real break of the night i'll be right back pee time all right i

937
03:36:06,620 --> 03:36:31,899
feel refreshed ow all right follow the wandering arch it's a quantum arch guaranteed

938
03:36:35,190 --> 03:36:57,180
it is all right so i gotta take a photo of it oh you can't see sorry all the wandering arch so

939
03:36:57,180 --> 03:37:22,840
i should just take a picture of it right okay go in my mic is not muted i'm right here i'm just

940
03:37:22,840 --> 03:37:56,920
gonna go in uh unidentified signal i found you where are you going from here there it is all

941
03:37:56,920 --> 03:38:09,450
right so what does this do for me in the grand scheme of things it just completes the story or

942
03:38:09,530 --> 03:38:27,690
something i guess what's this observing a quantum object observe an image of a quantum object these

943
03:38:27,690 --> 03:38:35,860
are the same observing a quantum object observing an image of a coin yes this is this is teaching

944
03:38:35,860 --> 03:38:42,579
us the thing that i accidentally figured out because of the moon this is where you're supposed

945
03:38:42,579 --> 03:39:01,579
to learn this that's fucking funny oh there it is i i figured it out i did it good thing i learned

946
03:39:01,579 --> 03:39:26,440
how to do this what is that oh i can walk on this wall hold on i gotta take a photo of it

947
03:39:27,239 --> 03:39:45,219
all right read the tutorial stones i mean i i kind of already know how this works the arch

948
03:39:45,219 --> 03:40:31,129
and the crystal do not naturally meet i'll just get it on there and then freeze it hey hey quantum

949
03:40:31,129 --> 03:40:44,920
quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum this is the last one but we made it harder

950
03:40:45,559 --> 03:41:12,069
oh shit i don't know what i'm gonna do about this i have to rock climb with this okay i didn't mean

951
03:41:12,069 --> 03:41:46,659
to do that did i just die build the quantum helicopter sounds coming wait what is going on

952
03:41:47,540 --> 03:41:59,379
why are these not moving now i don't want this one to move now i want this one to move

953
03:41:59,379 --> 03:42:16,020
right all the cameras watching them both there we go okay now you stay there now you stay here

954
03:42:16,899 --> 03:42:44,569
okay bring it up this way there you go you stay here and uh that's it congratulations

955
03:42:44,569 --> 03:42:54,489
you've been given the power tutorial we offer our congratulations you've learned the rule of

956
03:42:54,489 --> 03:42:59,639
quantum imaging take this knowledge with you on the remainder of your quantum pilgrimage

957
03:43:00,899 --> 03:43:12,780
remember the other quantum shards have other lessons to teach oh oh the shards are tutorials

958
03:43:18,899 --> 03:43:29,690
right the shards are just tutorials that's the purpose our curiosity goes with are you on

959
03:43:29,690 --> 03:43:33,370
your journey you walk in the footsteps of those who come before you and your path guides you those

960
03:43:33,370 --> 03:43:44,840
will follow later sure thanks a lot at least we completed it and that's how we fall down

961
03:43:47,260 --> 03:43:52,090
congrats on beating the tutorial thanks well let me go put this in the ship because

962
03:43:54,649 --> 03:44:07,639
now i gotta figure out how to go to the bottom of the ocean get it in the computer

963
03:44:08,440 --> 03:44:19,700
uh all tutorials have been completed actually all right this is done

964
03:44:20,659 --> 03:44:31,260
pilgrimage to the quantum moon was a deeply significant journey for the nomai

965
03:44:32,139 --> 03:44:36,520
they built a shrine on the moon to aid in the pilgrimage to its sixth location remember this

966
03:44:36,520 --> 03:44:49,909
final rule yeah yeah yeah so he did all this so what remains these two uh this one's pretty much

967
03:44:49,909 --> 03:44:57,690
done this over here but i don't need this i don't think do i because the big ticket is right here

968
03:44:58,489 --> 03:45:16,329
i could do the ocean depth thing but i signal locator probe tracking one of the orbital probe

969
03:45:16,329 --> 03:45:22,260
cannons three modules the probe tracking nodule is receiving data from the launched probe any

970
03:45:22,260 --> 03:45:27,620
nomai onboard the probe tracking nodule will be the first to see the coordinates of the eye of the

971
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:34,739
universe a nomai computer reports the probe tracking module is missing i saw the probe tracking

972
03:45:34,739 --> 03:45:39,780
module through a nomai projection pool it looks like the module is underwater

973
03:45:40,340 --> 03:46:13,000
i can see purple electricity outside that's down here how do i get down there let's get up here

974
03:46:16,469 --> 03:46:35,100
i think what do i want to go what the hell is that what is this what is that where's the

975
03:46:35,100 --> 03:46:47,420
observatory where's the observatory southern observatory and the ocean current discovery

976
03:46:48,379 --> 03:46:56,600
brittle hollows south pole the path beneath the surface at least i tried to do this before and

977
03:46:56,600 --> 03:47:01,479
no i did this but then i got turned we did the moon thing we met that god that the

978
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:11,350
there was somebody there brittle hollow brittle hollows equator i got distracted okay brittle

979
03:47:11,350 --> 03:47:24,329
hollows equator i feel like i'm getting close i feel like i'm getting what wait what is i what

980
03:47:24,329 --> 03:47:53,180
is this i need i what is this what is that what is this thing have i even gone over here yet

981
03:47:53,979 --> 03:48:13,670
it's white oh that's the white hole station all right let's go uh the sun's gonna blow up i did

982
03:48:13,670 --> 03:48:35,579
all that i might as well just die yeah this sun's going yeah i'm running to the sun i i i have

983
03:48:35,579 --> 03:49:07,479
probably like five minutes it's not enough time i can't even drive into the sun correctly hourglass

984
03:49:07,479 --> 03:49:22,020
planet oh shit you are absolutely right you could that's true by this point it's it's gonna be like

985
03:49:22,020 --> 03:49:42,899
yeah there'd be nothing there let's go no but we might no no it's over there's no way i'm gonna

986
03:49:42,899 --> 03:49:51,129
get that fast enough just burn up with the sun who cares it's kind of cool though just die

987
03:49:56,389 --> 03:50:00,149
i don't think being able to land and get out and do anything in 30 seconds is gonna work

988
03:50:02,709 --> 03:50:13,239
looks cool all right brittle hollow equator

989
03:50:43,989 --> 03:50:58,360
you don't know the ship has a landing mode i've used it like 100 times

990
03:51:08,069 --> 03:51:24,649
all right brittle hollow behind me turn is it behind me

991
03:51:26,170 --> 03:51:38,549
yeah what wait what the hell is it behind sun where is brutal hollow

992
03:51:45,909 --> 03:51:48,870
i'm getting so turned around it's right there what what's going on

993
03:51:48,870 --> 03:51:58,329
sun why can i not see it i'm gonna go in the sun i'm gonna go into the sun

994
03:51:59,370 --> 03:52:04,889
no no no i refuse i fucking refuse i refuse to go into the sun i refuse to do it for like a 10th

995
03:52:04,889 --> 03:52:35,780
time i refuse i refuse to do it no can't fuck out of here why can i not see this thing am i

996
03:52:35,780 --> 03:52:54,250
losing my goddamn mind what am i going backwards what direction am i facing where are the planets

997
03:52:54,250 --> 03:53:03,100
where are any planets what where did i go oh my god it out here i don't even know how i got this

998
03:53:03,100 --> 03:53:27,049
way i'm but i went out into the skybox i think i was so don't fly into the sun please do not

999
03:53:27,049 --> 03:54:00,889
autopilot sun me god waiter there's also a hanging city thing here too which is right above where

1000
03:54:00,889 --> 03:54:40,250
that guy rybeck is figure it out i guess okay now we attempt to find the thing i was trying to find

1001
03:54:40,250 --> 03:54:54,020
before is that cannon oh come on the hell is that holy shit wait i've never seen this before i've

1002
03:54:54,020 --> 03:54:59,850
never seen this before i've never seen this before what is this thing activate the gravity

1003
03:54:59,850 --> 03:55:05,379
cannon have i been here i've never been here before shuttle is currently rusting at the quantum

1004
03:55:05,780 --> 03:55:25,239
no i have yes i have wait it was it there's like three of these if it's like there's a couple of

1005
03:55:25,239 --> 03:55:35,700
these have i been to this one in particular though all right i'm gonna fire the cannon

1006
03:55:38,899 --> 03:55:54,329
bye i don't know i'm not sure where you're gonna go but hold on a minute wait at the very beginning

1007
03:55:54,329 --> 03:56:02,600
of the game the very beginning of the game somebody gets fired out on one of these cannons

1008
03:56:03,239 --> 03:56:21,610
what ship is it okay well bring it back cool all right shoot it again interesting

1009
03:56:21,770 --> 03:56:46,809
the crossroads yeah they've been over there where does this go southern observatory all right i

1010
03:56:46,809 --> 03:56:57,909
can't get in here can i and i get into the southern observatory from here that image is

1011
03:56:57,909 --> 03:57:05,159
psychological warfare i i'm not gonna click a link right now i'm busy i can't i have you have a

1012
03:57:05,159 --> 03:57:15,579
controller in my hand i'm gonna i'm just let's see what's over here i guess am i gonna make it

1013
03:57:15,979 --> 03:57:38,809
am i gonna make it across this is putting me where's this putting me why am i this is back

1014
03:57:38,809 --> 03:57:47,690
over here oh this is so confusing um i don't even know what i'm what i'm even looking for right now

1015
03:57:48,940 --> 03:58:37,739
actual wink southern observatory i can't even switch this now there's only one way i can go i

1016
03:58:37,739 --> 03:58:47,590
guess over here come from platform to platform wait what's that have i been over there

1017
03:58:48,229 --> 03:58:56,260
wait a minute hold on wait wait wait wait wait try jump i don't know if i can make that

1018
03:59:02,329 --> 03:59:05,690
black hole is there but can i make that that jump and then go into this

1019
03:59:06,409 --> 03:59:29,979
okay then this leads into this weird blue thing wait is that it i think that's it don't you fucking

1020
03:59:29,979 --> 03:59:50,889
dare kill me don't you dare kill me it almost did it almost just dropped on my head i need oxygen

1021
03:59:50,889 --> 04:00:21,420
but now where i don't know where to go why i can't even i like to squint to see actually

1022
04:00:21,420 --> 04:00:53,510
i'm like having trouble i can't i can't do this i can't do it i can't do it puke inducing i don't

1023
04:00:53,510 --> 04:01:12,260
think i can do it i can't do this i can't do it you can you can yes you can i can't i can't do it

1024
04:01:12,260 --> 04:01:43,030
jump okay one two and then to there i just i don't i don't i don't know what direction i'm supposed to

1025
04:01:43,510 --> 04:01:54,920
i'm just gonna try i don't know where i'm going but i'm gonna try and then jump into there

1026
04:01:55,879 --> 04:02:10,340
i made it this is inside the fucking circle i made it inside the bubble don't watch that

1027
04:02:10,340 --> 04:02:15,930
don't that's it looks like a fall hold on slow down what's in here a lot of info in here

1028
04:02:16,809 --> 04:02:26,489
lots of info when my dad and i were lifting orbital probe cannon components into orbit for

1029
04:02:26,489 --> 04:02:34,340
assembly and one somehow sank down beneath the current savva convinced me not to try to recreate

1030
04:02:34,340 --> 04:02:39,940
the phenomenon myself using the other cannon parts we're very curious to know what happened how could

1031
04:02:39,940 --> 04:02:46,389
something pass through the current my gratitude for your interesting question this is exciting

1032
04:02:46,389 --> 04:02:51,350
spire constructed a model of giants deep here at the brittle hollow southern observatory

1033
04:02:52,709 --> 04:03:00,790
and it reveals how an object might sink below the current you know i'm unable to grasp the

1034
04:03:00,870 --> 04:03:06,069
answer by looking through the projection pool if i visit the observatory would you kindly explain

1035
04:03:07,030 --> 04:03:13,860
you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole i'd be delighted to see you

1036
04:03:13,860 --> 04:03:20,139
the trailhead starts at brittle hollows equator right no you should have seen it we thought it

1037
04:03:20,139 --> 04:03:24,059
was impossible for any canon components to sink even partial below current but i sank straight

1038
04:03:24,059 --> 04:03:49,959
to the core all right i've seen this already this is the construction yard scam wink now i know i

1039
04:03:49,959 --> 04:04:07,190
can smell a scam from a mile away don't worry okay let's just keep going put tongue in there

1040
04:04:07,190 --> 04:04:14,139
stick tongue out savva's construction yard has been using the cyclones on giants deep to lift

1041
04:04:14,139 --> 04:04:20,620
orbitable probe cannon parts into orbit one component was pushed down past the current that

1042
04:04:20,620 --> 04:04:26,120
usually prevents anything from sinking by and are crafting a model to determine why this happened

1043
04:04:27,000 --> 04:04:30,040
an update it's now clear there are two different types of cyclone

1044
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:36,739
one most cyclones on giants deep rotate clockwise these are the cyclones to savva typically use it

1045
04:04:36,739 --> 04:04:43,350
to send components into orbit there also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite

1046
04:04:43,350 --> 04:04:51,190
direction pushes objects beneath the water and below the current my gratitude spire can always

1047
04:04:51,190 --> 04:04:56,629
showing me your handy work i'm intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone but was it really

1048
04:04:56,629 --> 04:05:03,319
necessary to build a model to tell me that the model will be useful as we continue monitoring

1049
04:05:03,319 --> 04:05:11,799
giants deep also i very much wanted to make a model for different kinds of cyclones one pushes

1050
04:05:11,799 --> 04:05:30,860
you down sit on your nose oh yeah where go up here and see if there's anything else

1051
04:05:32,059 --> 04:05:49,940
there's a lot of shit up here what is this uh teleporters let's see what have we learned

1052
04:05:49,940 --> 04:05:55,270
thus far in our search for the eye of the universe suppose the eye doesn't wish to be found

1053
04:05:56,229 --> 04:06:01,559
savva how can you suggest that the eye's signal called out to summon us to this star system

1054
04:06:02,120 --> 04:06:09,000
i'm aware i grew up hearing the eye's story if we're no closer to finding it than you were

1055
04:06:09,000 --> 04:06:14,969
when you first arrived here those of us on the vessel originally followed the eye's signal to

1056
04:06:14,969 --> 04:06:21,829
this star system but we were unable to warp to the eye itself the locator we built on the atl rock

1057
04:06:21,829 --> 04:06:27,989
and the new more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the eye's

1058
04:06:27,989 --> 04:06:37,209
signal the eye has stopped emitting its signal it's an impersonator based on our knowledge of

1059
04:06:37,209 --> 04:06:43,530
the quantum moon we believe the eye is in orbit around this star system's sun this would mean

1060
04:06:43,530 --> 04:07:08,649
the eye is located within a finite range what is all this how should our methods change as we

1061
04:07:08,649 --> 04:07:14,100
continue our search for the eye of the universe we know what the eye looks like thanks to the

1062
04:07:14,100 --> 04:07:18,180
quantum moon so what if we try to find the eye visually instead let's send out a probe

1063
04:07:19,139 --> 04:07:24,940
alo's idea is covered but we have no idea where the eye is in relation to here the probability

1064
04:07:24,940 --> 04:07:31,059
of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small i believe i have a solution

1065
04:07:31,059 --> 04:07:34,659
for that problem have you spoken with rami and pi about the technology they're developing

1066
04:07:36,260 --> 04:07:41,909
we need to build a probe launching mechanism to cover those long distances quickly and in an

1067
04:07:41,909 --> 04:07:48,280
orbit around a celestial body would circumvent the need to escape gravity's pull giant steve

1068
04:07:48,280 --> 04:07:53,319
would be a good choice it's furthest from the sun so we'll provide the best angles for launch

1069
04:07:53,319 --> 04:07:59,159
and it's moonless except when the quantum moon is visiting yes let's build the cannon in orbit

1070
04:07:59,159 --> 04:08:03,479
around giant steve we couldn't find the eye signal using two different devices built for

1071
04:08:03,479 --> 04:08:10,569
this exact purpose we should discontinue this search method couldn't figure it out

1072
04:08:18,680 --> 04:08:22,840
this whole this whole thing is all fucked up we're gonna zoom out we're gonna be like inside of a

1073
04:08:22,840 --> 04:08:27,559
pupil of a baby you know what i mean it's probably something like that whatever what does this do

1074
04:08:28,680 --> 04:09:02,500
this do okay well that's where all the that's where everything is so that one is all right

1075
04:09:02,500 --> 04:09:15,139
let's get the whole thing out oh it's an atom i figured it out this is the quantum moons location

1076
04:09:15,139 --> 04:09:25,770
it could be anywhere it could be anywhere look at all these different orbiting paths

1077
04:09:30,739 --> 04:09:37,770
all right i've done it i've did everything in the observatory now i have to go down a

1078
04:09:37,770 --> 04:09:55,659
cyclone down to the bottom of the ocean what's down here can i go in there no where does this

1079
04:09:55,659 --> 04:10:06,360
lead mary i did it to put the ship down yeah we already saw this and he was like i don't know why

1080
04:10:06,360 --> 04:10:18,139
i can't get in here all right that's done i wish that was my ship god damn it it's not

1081
04:10:18,139 --> 04:10:33,370
not now we got to go to don't die um maybe i should just die

1082
04:10:42,280 --> 04:11:03,829
yeah just die i know where to go now yeah it's going to be a baby's eyes are going to open and

1083
04:11:03,829 --> 04:11:11,290
it's not it's not going to be a video game it's going to zoom out of a in real life video of an

1084
04:11:11,850 --> 04:11:16,889
actual baby it's going to zoom out of their closed eye and they're going to open their eye and it's

1085
04:11:16,889 --> 04:11:20,969
going to be right when they were born and inside of their eye you can see all the planets and shit

1086
04:11:21,770 --> 04:11:46,420
loaded into the computer tornado situation southern observatory so this is um this is complete

1087
04:11:46,420 --> 04:11:50,340
the only thing that's missing is the ocean depths which i now know how to do

1088
04:11:51,540 --> 04:11:58,180
i just have to this looks pretty clean there's only really the ash twin project is the main thing

1089
04:11:59,299 --> 04:12:05,059
and this probe i'm sure i'll unlock these two and then we only have a few things down here and

1090
04:12:05,059 --> 04:12:25,590
that's it isn't it okay all right guys deep let's get sucked into a an actual tornado

1091
04:12:26,149 --> 04:12:40,069
time to get sucked in i pay left he's on the tutorial galaxy

1092
04:12:59,239 --> 04:13:08,309
all right find me one of these things okay they all spin in one direction one's not

1093
04:13:08,309 --> 04:13:17,299
spinning in the same direction see if we can find it now should i go in there with the ship

1094
04:13:17,299 --> 04:13:33,129
i think i'm gonna go in there with the ship so what direction you're both spinning

1095
04:13:34,170 --> 04:13:45,659
you're both going that's going the other direction which one of these is going the

1096
04:13:45,659 --> 04:14:08,180
other direction found it in the back there you are you're not going in the same direction

1097
04:14:09,139 --> 04:14:41,590
go ahead and throw us down sir here we go okay we oh there it is now now what i don't want to

1098
04:14:41,590 --> 04:14:51,989
touch this i feel like i shouldn't touch this it's electricity in water why would i want to touch it

1099
04:14:52,709 --> 04:15:24,120
i'm going in you can't i can't go in um wait hold on i remember i remember i remember inside

1100
04:15:24,120 --> 04:15:31,079
of a jellyfish you are protected from electricity one of the only fucking things i remember

1101
04:15:34,149 --> 04:15:42,920
all right i need a jellyfish is that the only one that's here or is there one closer in here

1102
04:15:42,920 --> 04:15:55,739
this one over there can i get this thing to have to kill it all right i'm gonna drive into it and

1103
04:15:55,739 --> 04:16:16,809
kill it okay is it dead i think i killed it it's still electrified how do you kill it inside of

1104
04:16:16,809 --> 04:16:34,489
this if you're inside of a jellyfish you won't get electrocuted how do i get in there what the

1105
04:16:34,489 --> 04:16:43,370
fuck oh my chest you can explode underwater what i don't like my ship exploded underwater

1106
04:16:49,799 --> 04:17:15,129
i can't touch the jellyfish how do i get inside the jellyfish then what did that guy say he said

1107
04:17:15,129 --> 04:17:24,840
oh yeah it tastes horrible but what was his actual okay yeah i found that but he had like

1108
04:17:24,840 --> 04:17:39,299
where's like the log i see something i don't know view entries no no it's the other one

1109
04:17:39,299 --> 04:18:10,139
this one okay it doesn't help me i'll try it again if i climb in it though won't that just

1110
04:18:10,139 --> 04:18:27,850
electrocute me when i touch it see what happens they'll haven't done anything really bad

1111
04:18:29,530 --> 04:18:44,260
let's go yeah it in my brain do i have to hit the jellyfish in the head

1112
04:18:45,219 --> 04:19:07,139
where there's no electricity or get out of the ship and stand on its head i'll try climbing in

1113
04:19:08,340 --> 04:19:16,469
i'll get out of the ship and i'll try to climb inside but there's nothing to climb in it's closed

1114
04:19:16,469 --> 04:20:03,819
it's like closed up there's nothing like i can go in where is it i can't climb electricity no you can't

1115
04:20:05,899 --> 04:20:13,100
i'm gonna take another look down there i'm gonna go to the bottom

1116
04:20:14,059 --> 04:20:23,770
let's see the fish let's go all the way to the bottom i don't think this ship is gonna

1117
04:20:23,770 --> 04:20:35,670
explode or anything but is there is there a bottom just this is not just sitting on the

1118
04:20:35,670 --> 04:20:42,260
bottom of the ocean it's down here okay i don't let me see all right we got jellyfish jellyfish

1119
04:20:42,260 --> 04:21:02,139
going in jellyfish going in that one goes in oh he's going in for a dunk all right uh wait

1120
04:21:04,700 --> 04:21:33,270
i swim through that that's me can i swim into that when he's done why is it it's leaving that

1121
04:21:33,270 --> 04:21:45,940
trail it's leaving that red spot it has to be can't be for no reason this i think the ship is too big

1122
04:21:45,940 --> 04:22:06,680
to do that isn't it let me get full fuel and oxygen everything i got 20 minutes don't worry

1123
04:22:07,479 --> 04:22:31,979
i should be able to swim through that after they go in hold on i got an idea why do i think i can't

1124
04:22:31,979 --> 04:22:38,469
touch the jellyfish because i if they're electrified and i bounced off i'm trying

1125
04:22:38,469 --> 04:23:00,979
this even if it doesn't work i don't care i'm just trying to why don't you just touch the jellyfish

1126
04:23:01,540 --> 04:23:23,219
what's wrong with you why can't what do you why do you think you can't that didn't fucking work

1127
04:23:36,899 --> 04:24:16,739
damn it now the ship got all the way back to the surface why all right we're gonna try to swim

1128
04:24:17,459 --> 04:24:53,059
inside am i in it am i in all right i'll give you one reason why this is i don't like this

1129
04:24:53,860 --> 04:25:02,739
because how is this this is not electrified is everything else is but like in under here isn't

1130
04:25:13,620 --> 04:25:37,780
we in i can't see anything are we in i don't even know if we're in oh we're in we're in right all

1131
04:25:37,780 --> 04:25:47,750
right get out holy shit okay i'm in what's up and what's down my flashlight doesn't work in here

1132
04:25:47,750 --> 04:26:17,500
what is that thing that's an eye and i go in it why my flashlight not work what's this this is

1133
04:26:17,500 --> 04:26:38,950
the can okay this is i'm gonna go in this way it's the eye of the universe holy shit i'm flying

1134
04:26:38,950 --> 04:27:42,149
around all right hold on i don't want it wants to come in my room i gotta get out hold on okay

1135
04:27:43,190 --> 04:28:04,440
hello dog hello i tell he's good he's on his pillow he's chilling on his pillow

1136
04:28:04,440 --> 04:28:29,500
well whatever but how do i do this i have no audio all right so here we are new content new content

1137
04:28:29,500 --> 04:28:55,399
is this the probe so wait a minute is this anything in here no i know you're reading show

1138
04:28:55,399 --> 04:29:02,200
auto i i can't the camera's like to i'll show them later i promise i gotta get through this

1139
04:29:02,200 --> 04:29:08,360
i have exciting news the ash twin project is always prepared to receive the probe data

1140
04:29:08,360 --> 04:29:19,219
from the orbital probe cannon liar oh no i can't i got like documents all over the ground

1141
04:29:19,860 --> 04:29:25,459
i got hold on i've got hold on i've got documents all over the ground i swear to god

1142
04:29:25,459 --> 04:29:35,100
there's documents everywhere and i have like insanely personal info i got so many

1143
04:29:35,100 --> 04:29:51,879
fucking documents everywhere they're surrounding me what is this another document

1144
04:29:56,620 --> 04:30:09,959
fancy desk with documents on the floor you don't understand my my fancy desk in quotes for what

1145
04:30:09,959 --> 04:30:17,510
you're saying is there's three monitors okay i'm gonna show i don't wait i'm gonna get he's all

1146
04:30:17,510 --> 04:30:24,729
he's all the way across the room hold on fucking documents everywhere i accidentally show one of

1147
04:30:24,729 --> 04:30:30,649
these documents i'm gonna be so mad no we got more documents over here i can't

1148
04:30:33,059 --> 04:30:43,510
i think the room's covered in documents i swear god i think i think i've cleared the room of all

1149
04:30:43,510 --> 04:30:59,989
documents ready for your close-up auto here we go

1150
04:31:02,780 --> 04:31:25,180
hard decision to do this hold on wait i see a stray document

1151
04:31:25,819 --> 04:32:13,030
documents we're good i was looking at me like what the hell are you doing i was you can't see

1152
04:32:13,590 --> 04:32:43,420
i can see a document guys i can't fucking move because one inch to your right is a bank document

1153
04:32:44,379 --> 04:32:53,860
i'm good there you go that's my special dog i saw it no you didn't clean your room i just it's just

1154
04:32:53,860 --> 04:33:29,209
a bank document i'm good there you go that's my special dog i saw it no you didn't clean your room

1155
04:33:29,209 --> 04:33:36,950
clean your room it's just documents it's not like it's like shitty diapers or something it's fine

1156
04:33:37,990 --> 04:33:50,330
all right here we go i'm exciting news the astron project is almost prepared to receive the probe

1157
04:33:51,130 --> 04:33:57,500
remy is adding some finishing touches here but she'll be finished soon are you are you in the

1158
04:33:57,500 --> 04:34:06,009
orbital probe cannon well we are the probe tracking module is ready to record each launches flight

1159
04:34:06,009 --> 04:34:13,990
trajectory and will automatically transmit all relevant data to you on other appendage i'm now

1160
04:34:13,990 --> 04:34:19,619
worried about this canon structural integrity and its cruise moral integrity once the probe

1161
04:34:19,619 --> 04:34:23,540
determines the location of the eye of the universe i'll send an alert directly to you and remy

1162
04:34:24,180 --> 04:34:49,029
we already saw this but let's do this let's go into the quicksand and okay this is the eye of

1163
04:34:49,029 --> 04:35:14,150
the universe like whatever this is this is the eye of the universe what else is in here imagine

1164
04:35:14,150 --> 04:35:18,150
privet the probe tracking module will be the first to know the coordinates of the eye of the universe

1165
04:35:18,950 --> 04:35:26,139
you'll be the first to see them i am honored and terrified you won't ask the orbit of a

1166
04:35:26,139 --> 04:35:31,700
probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks will you fret not my nervous friend we only need

1167
04:35:31,700 --> 04:35:36,819
to fire the probe once who minds if it compromises the canon structural integrity i think we read

1168
04:35:36,819 --> 04:35:42,680
this one i would mind malo i would mind because we won't be capable of receiving our probes data if

1169
04:35:42,680 --> 04:36:08,860
the probe tracking module is destroyed so where's the data where's the data is that very explodes

1170
04:36:09,419 --> 04:36:37,270
oh whoa whoa no no no no this way where you going over here okay so here comes the data spear

1171
04:36:45,900 --> 04:36:59,590
uh day pot has redeemed bernie sanders okay the 34 000 points okay retrieving data from probe 9406

1172
04:37:00,310 --> 04:37:44,869
visualizing current trajectory of probe 9406 with data all right that's what the sixth location

1173
04:37:44,869 --> 04:37:54,759
looks like retrieving previous launch data from ash twin for probes launch 9406

1174
04:37:55,639 --> 04:37:59,240
deep space anomaly matching all known criteria for the eye of the universe

1175
04:37:59,240 --> 04:38:22,619
bird of universe found by probe 9354 somebody found it retrieving stored coordinates from ash twin

1176
04:38:23,500 --> 04:38:49,139
displaying coordinates for the eye of the universe screenshot it okay it's c or like an l

1177
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:59,740
uh l a well what was that just blew by whatever i'll know i guess somebody will remember it

1178
04:38:59,740 --> 04:39:03,930
oops okay so i got i got the i got the coordinates for the eye of the universe

1179
04:39:04,490 --> 04:39:22,119
i have the coordinates for the eye of the universe i got it it's i did it let's go all right can you

1180
04:39:22,119 --> 04:39:47,509
stop doing that for me all right if you could stop doing that it'd be very nice okay all right

1181
04:39:48,229 --> 04:39:58,069
i i know the location of the eye of the universe anything else down here that i need to look at or

1182
04:39:58,069 --> 04:40:47,430
see i don't think there's anything else in here the tree i think i think i got everything i needed

1183
04:40:48,069 --> 04:40:58,889
i'm not sure there's anything else to do it's just this weird tree core all right let's go

1184
04:40:59,529 --> 04:41:17,060
let's just get electrocuted to death i could have swam through the whole time

1185
04:41:17,060 --> 04:41:54,759
i already tried that yeah okay out is okay i guess all right where's my ship

1186
04:42:05,450 --> 04:42:06,169
doing over here

1187
04:42:19,130 --> 04:42:26,740
all right let's deposit this data let's see we get probe tracking module all this has been

1188
04:42:27,459 --> 04:42:39,450
revealed i have the coordinates of the eye of the universe there's only one or two real outliers

1189
04:42:39,450 --> 04:42:47,080
here and it's this shit at ash twin project and black hole forge and then the hanging city and

1190
04:42:47,080 --> 04:43:15,240
then this anglerfish fossil you don't have any more info on this go to ash twin by this point

1191
04:43:16,200 --> 04:43:33,720
most of the sand will be gone right so i can kind of explore hold on a second

1192
04:43:54,549 --> 04:43:59,110
oh i forgot the big gravity in this after that i forgot the gravity the huge gravity in this planet

1193
04:44:00,549 --> 04:44:16,580
yeah i can't get the ship i can't get back in the ship now no longer have access to the

1194
04:44:17,459 --> 04:45:01,930
getting sucked away by the current i'm trying to jump i'm trying to fucking die

1195
04:45:01,930 --> 04:45:24,520
i can't even die correctly just throw me in the air and let me just go die somewhere

1196
04:45:26,840 --> 04:45:46,419
thank god the fucking sun's about to explode i can't even go forward please just throw me here

1197
04:45:47,459 --> 04:45:52,099
why are you not throwing what i'm standing inside of this tornado why am i not going up

1198
04:45:52,099 --> 04:46:08,200
you can't suck me up that's the down that's the own that's the down one it's the down one of

1199
04:46:08,200 --> 04:46:26,330
course it is blow up so i can please i wish i could delete that water effect

1200
04:46:47,990 --> 04:47:02,060
we need a good view i don't know if there is a good view there's kind of a view there it comes

1201
04:47:02,060 --> 04:48:01,180
been a while to get here well i did learn a lot so that's good progress when you're gonna do nancy

1202
04:48:01,180 --> 04:48:13,319
drew i don't do like an hour please note do not hold any of these terms accountable for germa

1203
04:48:13,319 --> 04:48:40,069
he's not going to do these things okay i want to go to the ash twin yep i think that's what i would

1204
04:48:40,069 --> 04:48:49,180
like to do i still haven't figured out what this thing even does or why it exists i just know it's

1205
04:48:49,180 --> 04:49:27,049
here you lied about fl studio yeah i did i'll take that one i did eye of the universe the twin

1206
04:49:27,689 --> 04:50:12,549
project thing land on it let's go all right now i'm just gonna make sure that i have enough

1207
04:50:13,270 --> 04:50:22,389
remember you still as confused as me about this game i have a very basic understanding of what's

1208
04:50:22,389 --> 04:50:32,200
going on but an incredibly basic understanding of what's going on there's this group of alien

1209
04:50:32,200 --> 04:50:41,299
people who wanted to find the eye of the universe and it wiped them out and they may have wiped out

1210
04:50:41,299 --> 04:50:50,139
everything here which also wiped us out the ship oh no the ship's gonna get grabbed no the ship's

1211
04:50:50,139 --> 04:51:01,180
gonna get grabbed by this this happens to me every time oh come on why i'm going for it

1212
04:51:01,900 --> 04:51:37,240
we're going so fast just get on the beam okay we're good okay good heel

1213
04:51:37,240 --> 04:52:15,299
okay good very good very good excellent hey we burnt some time hey i wonder if that

1214
04:52:15,299 --> 04:52:23,619
uh sand plant it's a little lower than it was before this time make sure it's not in the

1215
04:52:23,619 --> 04:52:49,860
trajectory of the sand it'd be very nice if you did that and get over there oh i'm not gonna land

1216
04:52:49,860 --> 04:53:30,759
on the equator again i'm not gonna land on the equator waiting for it to come by this is where

1217
04:53:30,759 --> 04:53:44,700
i want to be i don't care just crash don't land on a fucking equator okay right here is good

1218
04:53:45,099 --> 04:54:06,700
let's see what happens two on either side of this planet when this goes to zero it triggers the

1219
04:54:06,700 --> 04:54:13,819
event when all the sand is gone it triggers the event to bring me back to life with the cactus

1220
04:54:13,819 --> 04:54:35,299
jump no you're not dead i will be this whole this is where the masks are stored which is where i

1221
04:54:35,299 --> 04:54:50,040
you store the memories of the last person just control my breathing just hang out for a little

1222
04:54:50,040 --> 04:55:05,020
bit do i try cactus jump all right i'll try cactus jump no no i'm not gonna do that

1223
04:55:22,299 --> 04:55:47,860
there's this which i still don't know exactly what this is for let's get a look at it

1224
04:55:48,500 --> 04:56:23,619
i know some some ancient town i don't know cactus was this person here before is it cactus

1225
04:56:44,360 --> 04:56:50,840
all right i gotta be careful this is in the trajectory this is in the trajectory of

1226
04:56:51,799 --> 04:57:01,659
i can't get in no yeah i gotta put the ship all right it's starting to let me get in the ship

1227
04:57:05,560 --> 04:57:23,779
get the hell out of here here it comes all right what this has got to be some entrance

1228
04:57:25,819 --> 04:57:32,470
pumpkin smasher pumpkin smasher just gave a hundred dollars another ten thousand bit donation to

1229
04:57:32,470 --> 04:57:40,040
stream ridiculous you guys are crazy giving that much money but holy fuck thank you

1230
04:57:41,159 --> 04:57:47,000
10 000 bits huge bits they say hey jerma show your beautiful face for the rest of the stream

1231
04:57:49,880 --> 04:57:53,720
and i'm not gonna do that i don't do face game unless i'm playing a horror game or i'm

i explore i haven't left this lake bed have you seen the old shipwreck on ember's twin southern

1267
05:07:13,720 --> 05:07:20,919
hemisphere oh yeah i think i've already done that i don't have time for this i found something i

1268
05:07:20,919 --> 05:07:24,520
found uh the quantum moon everyone loves a good mystery all right i don't have time for this i

1269
05:07:24,520 --> 05:07:56,790
literally don't have time to talk to you bye goodbye all right i'm going back but i looked

1270
05:07:56,790 --> 05:07:59,669
over and saw that the satellite part had barely even gotten uh breached

1271
05:08:00,630 --> 05:08:24,729
so here we go so there is all kinds of shit in here now which one what do i go to this or here

1272
05:08:25,849 --> 05:08:44,139
i'm not sure what i should do first what are you doing

1273
05:08:46,380 --> 05:08:55,720
okay what do i do what should i do first something over with the satellite things

1274
05:08:56,680 --> 05:09:20,090
it's still going but one of those other buildings to go in what under here look anything under here

1275
05:09:20,090 --> 05:10:01,080
yet really this tower anything else on the surface level on this one it's still going though

1276
05:10:05,099 --> 05:10:34,439
dark don't please stop stop stop look at all this shit but this there's nothing down here

1277
05:10:40,020 --> 05:11:08,340
um just i just wanted to see what was beneath the sand okay i think this is stop

1278
05:11:09,540 --> 05:11:20,700
still going not still going i can go in here the door opened in here

1279
05:11:21,419 --> 05:11:28,540
there's an opening who cares this brings me to the top where i have no idea where it was before

1280
05:11:29,340 --> 05:11:49,849
i've already been up here this is the bridge this shit is coming in it's coming in right now it's

1281
05:11:49,849 --> 05:12:07,880
gonna it's gonna do the same thing i did last time does this eventually get something at the base

1282
05:12:08,599 --> 05:12:36,200
something deep buried in here no idea i've already been up top here we go yeah i've been up top

1283
05:12:36,200 --> 05:13:07,959
before here's the entrance is dropping anymore it still is is there anything else in the bottom of

1284
05:13:07,959 --> 05:13:13,740
this chip is gone well i mean we have like three minutes before it ends i'm not leaving this planet

1285
05:13:15,450 --> 05:13:22,009
all right so this is now what happens if i is there only and i have to go up the middle

1286
05:13:22,889 --> 05:13:34,169
but haven't i already been up here yeah i've already been up here

1287
05:13:34,729 --> 05:13:46,470
this doesn't do anything for me well now i'm gonna be able to see everything

1288
05:13:47,110 --> 05:13:55,369
what the fuck is down there all right it's just like the meatball i'm just i'm this is the meatball

1289
05:13:55,369 --> 05:14:22,599
core okay right in here i already went in here i have absolutely no idea what's going on

1290
05:14:23,880 --> 05:14:38,250
like the sun's about to explode gotta go in the cactus tower there's no more sand before

1291
05:14:41,479 --> 05:14:57,319
in here right in here and walk up this now i can walk down this done this already though

1292
05:14:57,319 --> 05:15:03,060
what the fuck is this what is this bro what is that hey hey hey hey no no what have i

1293
05:15:11,659 --> 05:15:24,330
get in there here's the first delivery warp fresh from the black hole forge

1294
05:15:25,209 --> 05:15:39,750
ash 209 i've been here before i think once yeah i've been here once you go to meet at the station

1295
05:15:40,389 --> 05:16:11,880
i've been here once yeah i didn't learn anything so there's other buildings that are on that equator

1296
05:16:12,520 --> 05:16:38,950
how many more there keep going with the same ones everything just kind of blends together

1297
05:16:40,069 --> 05:17:13,220
let me look at the notes all right uh yes they did they want to know if a 22 minute negative

1298
05:17:13,220 --> 05:17:26,580
time and if it was possible they can clue yeah yeah yeah yeah designs for each of the towers

1299
05:17:26,580 --> 05:17:30,659
and ashton's equator each tower warps through a different planet these towers are done to

1300
05:17:30,659 --> 05:17:46,340
visually reflect its warp destination yeah but all right i'm gonna go back and i'm just gonna

1301
05:17:46,340 --> 05:18:10,409
ride the equator right cactus tower again maybe all right so you know the problem is is this planet

1302
05:18:10,409 --> 05:18:18,500
always starts just just a circle so it's it it's not like everything gradually comes out of the

1303
05:18:18,500 --> 05:18:40,900
ground let me try to get to the cat i don't remember where the cactus from is is it one of

1304
05:18:40,900 --> 05:19:01,450
the equator ones it was part of the equator wasn't it so it's both the poles of these giant

1305
05:19:02,729 --> 05:19:36,459
huge satellite things i'm not on the equator right good all right so where what where's that

1306
05:19:36,459 --> 05:20:10,310
cactus where's the cactus one on the equator too fast this is all right let's go get in all right

1307
05:20:10,310 --> 05:20:14,229
this is literally right in the middle on the equator and okay i know what it looks like it's

1308
05:20:14,229 --> 05:20:23,560
good it's a weird like star shape i can't get in there yet i need an entrance besides the entrance

1309
05:20:23,560 --> 05:20:57,770
gonna be on cactus run hard mode there it is open come on hurry up is it broken this fucking thing's

1310
05:20:57,770 --> 05:21:44,220
broken i can't it's right here that's not it's gonna cross over on me all right it is immediately

1311
05:21:44,220 --> 05:22:15,659
to the right cactus room go through the cactuses be careful go oh shit wait what's that do i didn't

1312
05:22:15,659 --> 05:22:39,659
do anything what's this what's that what's this somebody said look up at the ground

1313
05:22:41,180 --> 05:23:03,299
how do you look up at the ground i knew we were gonna fucking pour it into the sun station i knew

1314
05:23:03,299 --> 05:23:13,369
it i told you i told you guys i knew it but when i freaked out and started screaming about this game

1315
05:23:13,369 --> 05:23:17,209
and i was like there's no fucking way i have to do this there's no way i have to fucking port i knew

1316
05:23:17,209 --> 05:23:27,830
it 81 000 years ago no user commands received for 10 minutes all systems entering sleep six

1317
05:23:27,830 --> 05:23:31,909
minutes 40 seconds increased solar activity detected sun station hull integrity approaching

1318
05:23:31,909 --> 05:23:53,259
critical levels closing emergency doors opens the emergency door um i didn't want to do that

1319

1375
05:36:16,599 --> 05:36:58,150
straight out this is way harder than it looks that's i can't climb up i have to jump press

1376
05:36:58,150 --> 05:37:04,680
left left triggers to go down is the right trigger is the one that's for a and right

1377
05:37:04,680 --> 05:37:25,900
trigger is the thrusters just say you hate this game already oh that's so funny

1378
05:37:30,939 --> 05:37:37,029
i messed up like a tricky sequence twice oh so it's like dude just like admit you

1379
05:37:37,029 --> 05:38:03,909
fucking hate this game like i mean come on man slow down i'm so close to the end of the game

1380
05:38:03,909 --> 05:38:10,709
like seriously it's in the sun station you pick up a block of wood and you stick it in your mouth

1381
05:38:10,709 --> 05:38:42,540
and read it all right i can't go full tilt here if only he knew how to control no it's not that

1382
05:38:43,340 --> 05:38:48,299
all right and i had like two minutes of oxygen remaining too so like all this stuff is going in

1383
05:38:48,299 --> 05:38:53,029
my if i don't get it this time it's not gonna happen i'm just gonna be i'm gonna be completely

1384
05:38:53,029 --> 05:39:05,340
completely honest with you he flew the off no i jumped i jumped out and my character started

1385
05:39:05,340 --> 05:39:11,340
turning i didn't press any buttons he just started going like this i didn't press anything it just

1386
05:39:11,340 --> 05:39:35,990
started moving on its own that's the point just don't touch anything so just just walk out and

1387
05:39:35,990 --> 05:39:46,200
don't even just put the controller down is that for real skip time yeah i'm going to the other

1388
05:39:46,200 --> 05:40:02,700
planet no no why would i that's a that's a one guy comment why would i listen to that all right

1400
05:43:28,409 --> 05:43:50,250
get the fuck out of here that's not impressive i know it's not impressive all right do i listen

1401
05:43:50,250 --> 05:44:00,299
to the one guy and just hold a while i go forward and that's it walk off and don't move oh don't say

1402
05:44:00,299 --> 05:44:12,380
that just hold a walk out and hold a don't press anything match velocity station can't be targeted

1403
05:44:12,380 --> 05:44:22,939
just don't press any buttons i'm not gonna press anything but what about you were wrong you were

1404
05:44:22,939 --> 05:44:46,630
wrong no i got it okay i got it okay i made it mission science compels us to explore the sun

1405
05:44:51,020 --> 05:44:54,700
can't we change this i don't enjoy working in view of such a morbid mission statement

1406
05:44:55,419 --> 05:45:03,419
but it's accurate we're going to create a supernova for the purpose of scientific progress

1407
05:45:03,419 --> 05:45:08,860
that's our mission the mission is to decide if such an irresponsible feat is even possible so

1408
05:45:08,860 --> 05:45:16,090
they did it here's a better one mission determine if it's possible to prompt the sun to explode why

1409
05:45:16,330 --> 05:45:23,880
why do they want the sun to why are you doing this you lack a sense of humor at least i don't

1410
05:45:23,880 --> 05:45:30,330
lack a sense of ethics kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the sun does

1411
05:45:33,930 --> 05:45:56,500
oh you're dead why the masks little go-karts wait are they like bugs is this like a person lying

1412
05:45:56,500 --> 05:46:02,020
down with like weird beetle people or is that just like a storage unit i don't know i don't know i

1413
05:46:02,020 --> 05:46:08,619
saw a guy wearing one of these all right let's go let's go in i could go up but let's go down

1414
05:46:08,619 --> 05:46:15,580
first wait that's the sun is down there sun's down there the sun is in there let's go up

1415
05:46:39,990 --> 05:47:15,319
uh this happened to me what is going on what i didn't run out of time

1416
05:47:16,279 --> 05:47:25,990
ran out of time the supernova didn't happen the sun was expand well i'm trying to like explore

1417
05:47:27,939 --> 05:47:33,139
okay on the back of the game's cereal box it's like explore everything and look at stuff and read

1418
05:47:33,139 --> 05:47:46,299
stuff i had to go down well how am i okay how am i supposed to know i was supposed to go down

1419
05:47:47,259 --> 05:47:59,750
first i want there was a way to go up all right i don't have that info we're gonna do it again

1420
05:48:00,310 --> 05:48:08,580
there's a setting that pauses time while reading why is that not enabled automatically

1421
05:48:11,560 --> 05:48:37,369
it is it is it is it's on all right let me do this again i just i i i turned around like five

1422
05:48:37,369 --> 05:48:46,459
fucking times where the hell am i going i have to do this should we use the you i go i'm gonna use

1423
05:48:46,459 --> 05:49:00,759
the fire yeah what was that don't do that don't do what are you talking about wait what are you

1426
05:49:44,020 --> 05:49:56,950
okay we're on the equator i'm on the equator every time am i yes i am move it out of the way

1427
05:49:56,950 --> 05:50:06,380
right here should be good like right here please would stop rolling the fuck around

1428
05:50:19,849 --> 05:50:26,090
use the campfire at the start yo signal boost this shit yeah retweet it everybody retweet it

1429
05:50:46,889 --> 05:51:04,060
where is it retweet at the campfire how's it not popped up yet all right you guys see any good

1430
05:51:04,060 --> 05:51:28,310
movies stand here no i have to go into the sun i have to float over there again and you saw how

1431
05:51:28,310 --> 05:51:33,750
horrendous that was i have to do that again i was so hoping i was never gonna have to do that ever

1432
05:51:33,750 --> 05:51:54,180
fucking again and i have to do it again match velocity i can't because you have to have something

1433
05:51:54,180 --> 05:51:57,939
to target to match the velocity i will match the velocity of the sun and fly right into it

1434
05:51:59,220 --> 05:52:18,970
okay here we go passes through and then we go don't touch anything that's what i did last time

1435
05:52:18,970 --> 05:53:07,369
it was a disaster and i ended up just freaking out and fixing it let's go okay one two three

1436
05:53:07,369 --> 05:53:16,810
three that's bullshit you're right that's ridiculous just just ridiculous just ridiculous

1437
05:53:18,169 --> 05:53:41,369
oh i have to do the jump all right i'll get it you're gonna be falling to the sun for fun

1438
05:53:41,369 --> 05:54:08,630
elbert said stop saying that um i'm gonna say why did it not work okay left trigger right trigger

1439
05:54:09,189 --> 05:54:53,830
right trigger left trigger right trigger and then go down here we go go down what's in here

1440
05:54:54,889 --> 05:55:03,939
uh read star has reached out end of natural life cycle now approaching red giant stage warning

1441
05:55:03,939 --> 05:55:11,270
evacuate sun station approximate time until sun station is destroyed by expanding star four

1442
05:55:11,270 --> 05:55:30,869
minutes nine seconds approximate time until star's death 15 minutes and 39 seconds i need a disc what

1443
05:55:30,950 --> 05:55:37,060
happened to the sun station not fire it fired yarrow but it failed the sun barely responded

1444
05:55:37,060 --> 05:55:42,740
there were infinitesimally small surface level changes but they were barely visible even to the

1445
05:55:42,740 --> 05:55:51,750
third eye the sun station is useless it will never and could never cause the sun to explode

1446
05:55:52,630 --> 05:55:58,020
i don't know what comes next my friends i suppose we must start over but i'm unsure how to start

1447
05:55:58,020 --> 05:56:06,090
over don't i do it uh return to ash twin first my friend perhaps a change of task would help

1448
05:56:06,090 --> 05:56:10,009
aspire notice to comet approaching this star system that we'd like to investigate

1449
05:56:11,930 --> 05:56:19,930
hi i hurt for you my friends we all know how hard you both work i can only offer my compassion how

1450
05:56:19,930 --> 05:56:27,290
are you how is it idea we're well yarrow or as well as can be expected given the circumstances

1451
05:56:27,290 --> 05:56:32,330
though disappointed may have disagreed with exploding the sun but i never wish the device

1452
05:56:32,330 --> 05:56:56,840
would fail and hope their terrible work was finished i mean that wait hold on these are all

1453
05:56:56,840 --> 05:57:02,139
people standing around me these are all people standing around a circle and they're all standing

1454
05:57:02,139 --> 05:57:25,500
around me is that it is there anything else i can do in here uh we're gonna die run run

1455
05:58:19,340 --> 05:58:30,549
what did they even do for me i just they tried to explode the sun with the sun station and then

1456
05:58:31,349 --> 05:58:42,840
the comet they wanted to use the comet instead so the comet is what's making the sun explode

1457
05:58:42,840 --> 05:59:01,060
but why how the sun station done the sun was designed the sun station is going to make the

1458
05:59:01,060 --> 05:59:06,180
sun go supernova the nomai fired the sun station but it had no effect on the sun they concluded

1459
05:59:06,180 --> 05:59:11,380
the sun station can never cause the sun to go supernova the failure of the sun station the nomai

1460
05:59:11,380 --> 05:59:16,099
took a break to investigate the newly arrived comet according to a nomai computer our sun has

1461
05:59:16,099 --> 05:59:40,139
reached the end of its natural life cycle okay i still don't get what i do how what do i do about

1462
05:59:40,139 --> 05:59:50,310
this ash twin project all the memories are recorded through a storage unit within ash twin

1463
05:59:51,270 --> 06:00:12,060
there's also this coal forge in the hanging city what course the black hole forage there's a huge

1464
06:00:12,060 --> 06:00:20,619
nomai city just the north all right i'm gonna try this i'm gonna do this so this is right above

1465
06:00:20,619 --> 06:00:25,020
ribex campsite i'm gonna find ribex we're gonna do this tomorrow let's just crash and die

1466
06:00:51,180 --> 06:01:17,880
try to get out you're gonna fall into the fun for son elbertson

1470
06:02:07,700 --> 06:02:23,020
know this in act five um yeah i know that too i have to beat diablo though i have to kill diablo

1471
06:02:23,020 --> 06:02:42,819
first tomorrow's tony hawke underground the xbox 360 hard drive has come in and it's saturday's

1481
06:04:07,479 --> 06:04:49,099
there's a spot i can sneak in there it is all right let's go down almighty god in chat

1482
06:04:50,680 --> 06:05:03,689
good god human dev in chat cool hey dude um why did uh not we can ask questions about the game

why did you give us fingernails what was the point of that he's over there i can't just how

1484
06:05:16,950 --> 06:05:22,889
do i get over there reliably how do i get over there reliably without just jumping and dying

1485
06:05:23,529 --> 06:05:34,700
i could go down here but how far does it bring me i'm not gonna jump where does this bring me

1486
06:05:35,259 --> 06:05:52,020
he's right there right there all right i think i can actually jump from here and land in there

1487
06:05:52,740 --> 06:06:14,250
no i don't ah okay it's above ryback right so ryback is there the hanging city is here like up

1488
06:06:14,250 --> 06:06:42,150
here i'm gonna okay i'm gonna turn up here so what like this way like up there or right there

1489
06:06:42,790 --> 06:07:13,189
how do i get over there how do i get the ridge like go that way i know i'm looking at the funnel

06:08:00,229 --> 06:08:13,020
just more huge bits hayden clip fell 10 000 in kxc 50 at the same exact time have fun space cowboy

1492
06:08:13,580 --> 06:08:26,889
thank you guys both of you god that's a shitload of money thank you all of you that's too much

1493
06:08:27,689 --> 06:08:37,639
hanging city co-op bits something like that oh well that was deeply unpleasant i made it this

1494
06:08:37,639 --> 06:08:41,720
far though i guess that's the part to focus on and not how i'll eventually have to get back up that

1495
06:08:41,720 --> 06:08:47,080
path wow this place sure is something looks like the hanging city is north from here and east is

1496
06:08:47,080 --> 06:08:52,729
a gravity cannon i definitely want to see that another thing i'm detecting oxygen from somewhere

1497
06:08:52,729 --> 06:08:57,450
below which is good since i uh used up a lot of my supply screaming during the trip from the surface

1498
06:08:58,250 --> 06:09:02,619
as i stop driving heaving i'm gonna head further down below so i can refill my tank

1499
06:09:03,419 --> 06:09:20,659
what's this say gravity cannon yep let's check it out let's check it out hanging city

1500
06:09:21,380 --> 06:09:54,310
i don't want to use any fuel or anything i'm scared to use fuel i'm not gonna get hit in the

1501
06:09:54,310 --> 06:10:19,900
head with that boulder am i school district melt water district eye shrine district

1502
06:10:21,880 --> 06:10:48,299
black hole forge district i need air i'm what black hole forge i need air somewhere

1503
06:10:48,299 --> 06:10:49,419
we're gonna get it there you go

1504
06:10:50,220 --> 06:10:56,229
oh

1505
06:11:23,290 --> 06:11:53,580
okay i guess i plugged it in hold on this text here the ashtron project requires a powerful

1506
06:11:53,580 --> 06:12:18,099
highly advanced warp core how should we obtain it we could craft a new advanced warp core inspired

1507
06:12:18,099 --> 06:12:24,680
by the vessel's warp core abandoning the vessel's warp core and its casing means losing valuable

1508
06:12:24,680 --> 06:12:29,880
knowledge this is true however its knowledge we have little hope for covering it would be best

1509
06:12:29,880 --> 06:12:36,060
to relearn i think i'd very much like to craft such a powerful core more relevantly i believe

1510
06:12:36,060 --> 06:12:43,130
the black hole forge crew and i could recreate the basic design is the safest path for our plan

1511
06:12:44,090 --> 06:12:49,750
is the safest path the best best one or our goal is worth the risk is it though we've tried for so

1512
06:12:49,750 --> 06:12:55,750
long to find something that i and others now believe might be possible to find what are they

1513
06:12:55,750 --> 06:13:04,740
doing here now can i just be honest what the hell are they doing here i can find the eye we

1514
06:13:04,740 --> 06:13:12,139
would find the eye why because we have to why do you have to because that's what we do why

1515
06:13:13,830 --> 06:13:25,139
that's what we do if we do that's what i've been yeah the greatest challenge here i think is we

1516
06:13:25,139 --> 06:13:28,580
don't have to design for such a powerful core or any of the original craft is the vessel's core

1517
06:13:30,229 --> 06:13:35,750
no but what was apprentice to annona who created the original design and a black hole forge is

1518
06:13:35,750 --> 06:13:41,029
adept at crafting simpler cores i believe i can be of use here the vessel's warp core was created

1519
06:13:41,029 --> 06:13:49,659
before my time but unknown explained many of his designs to me but didn't we we got it right from

1520
06:13:49,659 --> 06:13:56,549
the horse's mouth already we talked to one of these people and i was like what are you doing

1521
06:13:56,549 --> 06:14:09,560
you just do okay why do you want to find the eye because we do i want to know why i need to know

1522
06:14:09,720 --> 06:14:16,200
why i can't wait to know why it's i'm gonna be told why and it's gonna be a huge like wow

1523
06:14:16,200 --> 06:14:28,020
i can't wait you've already they already told you yeah because they just wanted they just wanted

1524
06:14:28,020 --> 06:14:33,299
know as much as they possibly can they just they strive for knowledge right that's all it was

1525
06:14:35,930 --> 06:14:46,979
they're just curious you heard the term don't fly too close to the sun it seems like they did like

1526
06:14:46,979 --> 06:14:54,869
a hundred times this would require a return to dark bramble loom my father said many good know

1527
06:14:54,869 --> 06:15:01,720
my perished there retrieve the warp core from the vessel retrieve the warp core from dark bramble

1528
06:15:05,819 --> 06:15:10,220
my mentor and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on ember twin

1529
06:15:11,180 --> 06:15:20,459
i saw that once i studied an anglerfish fossil using that knowledge we could avoid the anglerfish

1530
06:15:20,459 --> 06:15:28,150
entirely i remember that anglerfish fossil we used to play in fossil fossil fish cave when we were

1531
06:15:28,150 --> 06:15:36,630
children that's that's fossil let's say that five times fast fossil fish cave fossil fish cave

1532
06:15:40,619 --> 06:15:44,139
what meloria and i have learned is that and that fossil would theoretically help us evade the

1533
06:15:44,139 --> 06:15:51,849
anglerfish but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen vessels warp core is broken

1534
06:15:51,849 --> 06:15:57,380
at best we call those present when the vessel crash said it was it's the same lethal injuries

1535
06:15:57,380 --> 06:16:02,889
there's no guaranteed reward for the risk perhaps we could still repair it my grandmother my

1536
06:16:03,290 --> 06:16:06,810
my grandmother told me there was a little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage

1537
06:16:10,139 --> 06:16:17,290
guys that's a liar even if it no longer functions the old core could be a valuable blueprint

1538
06:16:17,290 --> 06:16:35,930
provided we're able to transport it back here all right how often do i who cares let's keep going

1539
06:16:35,930 --> 06:16:49,819
up any more of those uh any more of those memory sticks for some reason you can't walk over that

1540
06:16:54,340 --> 06:16:58,900
i feel strange trying to recreate and known as warp core without him at times it still feels

1541
06:16:58,900 --> 06:17:05,590
strange to no longer be his very young apprentice for the black hole forge to be in my care and not

1542
06:17:05,590 --> 06:17:12,250
his this will always feel strange even though my time with him was short i miss my old mentor

1543
06:17:12,970 --> 06:17:22,939
the chance to try to have the chance to try is thrilling but i don't want to disappoint everyone

1544
06:17:22,939 --> 06:17:27,020
i think i can do this probably but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my

1545
06:17:27,020 --> 06:17:33,400
own abilities was i wrong and volunteering to build it i was born in the star system and

1546
06:17:33,400 --> 06:17:40,340
never saw and known as warp core with my own three eyes i only know what he taught me they have three

1547
06:17:40,340 --> 06:17:49,020
eyes what if i've bitten off a larger portion than i can consume still all i can give is my best and

1548
06:17:49,020 --> 06:17:54,220
as anona would say should my best prove insufficient and we will find another way to achieve what's

1549
06:17:54,220 --> 06:18:15,130
needed i have clary and rude in the forge and i have my clan i'm not alone on the button to turn

1550
06:18:15,130 --> 06:18:46,310
on going up we are up very high mother fucker there's a distress beacon down there i'll have

1551
06:18:46,310 --> 06:18:59,659
to read that out later all right we made it to this kind of snowy area to go that way but wait is

1552
06:18:59,659 --> 06:19:30,340
there anything over here not really almost out of fuel which is not good running water all right

1553
06:19:30,340 --> 06:19:36,180
remember where this is this is right to the right south of the north pole and it's a little river

1554
06:19:36,180 --> 06:19:44,150
that you can go in all right cool a little shortcut um i'm gonna go back in here though

1555
06:19:52,569 --> 06:20:11,500
wait go all the way back down all right let me see let me find where's that distress beacon

1556
06:20:12,790 --> 06:20:16,409
down there there's more stuff i could do over here wasn't there

1557
06:20:17,529 --> 06:20:29,400
fortune controls uh yeah they go up and around up on like this surface let's go

1558
06:20:30,279 --> 06:20:34,169
there was like two other there were two or three other places to go

1559
06:20:41,779 --> 06:20:52,740
can i just go this way i guess i mean i i'd use the black hole thing

1560
06:20:53,860 --> 06:21:02,340
where's the black hole district isn't that just in it i'm going this way whatever i'm just gonna

1561
06:21:02,340 --> 06:21:22,869
explore uh i don't i don't seem to lead anywhere what does this go keep going not really what is

1562
06:21:22,869 --> 06:21:31,689
over here the sun's gonna blow up any second we have probably three minutes before the things

1563
06:21:31,689 --> 06:21:55,209
gonna start doing them on the music everybody is dead you're all dead everyone's dead everybody

1564
06:21:55,209 --> 06:22:25,020
did they supernova themselves oh yeah they commented themselves i get info to read yeah

1565
06:22:25,020 --> 06:22:30,810
some somebody uh somebody touched this thing that they weren't supposed to touch let's just see what

1566
06:22:30,810 --> 06:22:39,270
this is he welcomed in this place this shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to the star

1567
06:22:39,270 --> 06:22:44,790
system to signal from the eye we observe the eye signal in our travels and followed it here to

1568
06:22:44,790 --> 06:22:50,569
find its source what we know is this the source of the signal which we have chosen to call the

1569
06:22:50,569 --> 06:22:59,450
eye of the universe is older than the universe itself the rest we have yet to learn enter and

1570
06:22:59,450 --> 06:23:11,619
open your mind to its possibilities what is the eye of the universe here we go it's gonna tell us

1571
06:23:12,779 --> 06:23:18,060
the eye is the source of the signal that brought us here suppose the eye is a more advanced being

1572
06:23:18,779 --> 06:23:24,860
pose the eye is older than this universe so imagine how much it could teach us perhaps it

1573
06:23:24,860 --> 06:23:38,659
is a cosmic library what is the eye's signal suppose the eye wishes to communicate the signal

1574
06:23:38,659 --> 06:23:43,779
is the eye's voice it speaks a language we don't yet know or maybe the signal is the eyes attempted

1575
06:23:43,779 --> 06:23:50,259
expressing itself the signal is a call where we the intended where were the intended audience

1576
06:23:51,220 --> 06:24:04,299
from the signal we were able to determine the eyes approximate age for lack of age and how can

1577
06:24:04,299 --> 06:24:09,639
the eye be older than the universe itself suppose it's a relic from a previous universe

1578
06:24:10,599 --> 06:24:15,159
the early universe was unimaginably hot and dense if anything existed before it would have been

1579
06:24:15,159 --> 06:24:31,560
destroyed suppose the universe is older than previously assumed okay uh universe old eye

1580
06:24:31,560 --> 06:25:08,889
knowledge good work guys what is this thing let's go up a little forward on something

1581
06:25:12,060 --> 06:25:17,419
what do you have to say i no longer believe as i did as a child on ember twin that the eye of the

1582
06:25:17,419 --> 06:25:28,150
universe wishes to harm us but it may not want to be found either what else do you have to say

1583
06:25:28,709 --> 06:25:32,549
the terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that circumstance

1584
06:25:33,349 --> 06:25:40,869
we saw her earlier i suspect imagining we are special to the eye in some ways wishful thinking

1585
06:25:40,869 --> 06:25:47,590
the eye might have called out to any sentient species or it might not have been calling out

1586
06:25:47,590 --> 06:25:55,580
at all and that my ancestors heard the eye's signal holds no great meaning this wouldn't be

1587
06:25:55,580 --> 06:26:01,080
so bad in fact the eye may not have wishes at all we have no evidence supporting this

1588
06:26:01,639 --> 06:26:14,759
it didn't call out to chat it didn't call out to you guys no sorry it wasn't calling to you

1589
06:26:15,400 --> 06:26:21,990
all right have we learned most of what we've learned so far have we learned everything we

1590
06:26:21,990 --> 06:26:51,619
need to know here hey asshole with the eye okay let's go back i think i've read most of the

1591
06:26:51,619 --> 06:26:57,700
things i can read here i missed please grab the ledge grab i'm going to the fucking black hole

1592
06:26:58,259 --> 06:27:01,299
i'm going to the black hole i'm going to the fucking black hole i tried to skip it i just

1593
06:27:01,299 --> 06:27:24,520
wanted to go so i wanted to go and get out and wait what the hell are you doing out here

1594
06:27:25,479 --> 06:27:38,939
wait what the hell are you doing out here this is a scripted part of the movie why are you doing

1595
06:27:38,939 --> 06:27:56,299
this hanging city the vessel oh the vessels warp core broke when the ship crashed in dark bramble

1596
06:27:57,180 --> 06:28:16,220
the vessel where we almost completed this one escape pod two warp core broke when the ship

1597
06:28:16,299 --> 06:28:25,849
crashed in dark bramble to dark bramble we go it sounds about to blow up but you know

1598
06:28:26,729 --> 06:28:55,580
these things things about to blow up i want to see the supernova it's gonna take too long no let's go

1599
06:28:59,830 --> 06:29:25,880
we did learn a lot but where i have to get into that ash twin database thing i have the key

1600
06:29:27,000 --> 06:29:30,520
i have the coordinates for the eye of the universe what am i what do i do with them

1601
06:29:31,319 --> 06:29:59,110
go to the vessel did just open up vessel no i debated how to obtain the powerful highly

1602
06:29:59,110 --> 06:30:03,830
advanced warp core when i traveled to the solar system in pursuit of a signal from something

1603
06:30:03,830 --> 06:30:13,930
older than the universe itself the vessel so we need to go to dark bramble and find this vessel

1604
06:30:18,819 --> 06:30:33,400
anglerfish no mine learned how to evade anglerfish by studying an anglerfish fossil they found on

1605
06:30:33,400 --> 06:31:00,939
ember twin let's go for it dark bramble it's been a while since i've been here actually

1606
06:31:06,119 --> 06:31:29,459
it's been it's been probably eight seven or eight in-game hours since i've been here dark

1607
06:31:29,459 --> 06:32:09,799
bramble and we're looking for a vessel a ship ship ship ship some kind of ship i'm gonna say

1608
06:32:09,799 --> 06:32:46,310
distress beacon yep yep yep there it is good impression of storage wars no that would that

1609
06:32:46,310 --> 06:33:36,020
would be a little different that would be yeah what the fuck is that it's a signal there it is

1610
06:33:36,020 --> 06:33:53,799
all right how do i get in there reliably right there there it is all right get in on the ship

1611
06:33:54,360 --> 06:34:22,970
all right fuck it let's get in there all right just get out i can swim right our escape pod

1612
06:34:23,049 --> 06:34:27,770
crashed as we tried to flee this place destroying our movement and communication capabilities in

1613
06:34:27,770 --> 06:34:33,459
the process we've held out as long as we could here but this pod supply of breathable air is

1614
06:34:33,459 --> 06:34:38,740
nearly depleted and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently the best chance at survival

1615
06:34:38,740 --> 06:34:46,889
is to return to the vessel to either repair the damage or more probably wait rescue second is

1616
06:34:46,889 --> 06:34:52,259
the message finished the vessel's beacon is already growing fainter it'll be gone in a matter of

1617
06:34:52,259 --> 06:35:03,259
hours we need to leave here isn't this is not the vessel all right escape pod three

1618
06:35:13,290 --> 06:35:19,189
this shit ain't the vessel well maybe i'll get some info where the hell it is

1619
06:35:24,169 --> 06:35:28,569
escape pod three vessel has been mortally injured emergency sequence activated awaiting departure

1620
06:35:28,569 --> 06:35:36,180
from vessel now launching escape pod three multiple collisions have altered pods trajectory

1621
06:35:36,180 --> 06:35:42,360
significant damage to pod detected navigation error life support error propulsion error

1622
06:35:42,360 --> 06:35:51,610
error scanning external environment scan complete gravity not detected breathable

1623
06:35:51,610 --> 06:35:59,659
air not detected multiple life forms detected do not exit pod i know what the vessel is the

1624
06:35:59,659 --> 06:36:15,220
vessel okay the vessel is the thing that explodes when you wake up there's a new problem our

1625
06:36:15,220 --> 06:36:21,930
equipment is detecting two distinct beacons from the vessel but it's impossible for the vessel to

1626
06:36:21,930 --> 06:36:28,580
be in two different locations at the same time i agree but the beacons are exactly identical to

1627
06:36:28,580 --> 06:36:33,540
each other perhaps if i had more time we're nearly out of time already din the vessel's

1628
06:36:33,540 --> 06:36:39,340
beacon is quickly fading soon will be gone and we'll be lost we will follow the beacon whose

1629
06:36:39,340 --> 06:36:45,610
source is nearest to us suppose that beacon is false we likely don't have enough air to reach

1630
06:36:45,610 --> 06:36:51,459
the farther of the two beacons did the decision is made for us we'll leave a trail of lights as

1631
06:36:51,459 --> 06:37:01,509
we go there's still a chance someone could hear our escape pods distress signal okay don't open

1632
06:37:01,509 --> 06:37:18,099
this yet i want to read this emergency escape hatch wait no we gotta go we gotta follow these

1633
06:37:18,099 --> 06:37:43,689
lights give me the ship give me in the ship okay all the lights going that way i'm just

1634
06:37:43,689 --> 06:38:02,220
into the computer escape pod three escape pod three survivors another beacon didn't say there

1635
06:38:02,220 --> 06:38:29,610
was another beacon that's what is this is this a ship holy fuck they're all dead okay hold on

1636
06:38:30,409 --> 06:38:50,380
what are they what are they doing over here ready who come here searching for us we followed one of

1637
06:38:50,380 --> 06:38:58,200
the two beacons from the vessel to this place but now can go no further it's almost too faint to

1638
06:38:58,200 --> 06:39:04,520
hear now but the vessel's beacon is still faintly emitting from within this thorny seed yet the

1639
06:39:04,520 --> 06:39:08,759
opening is too small for even a single gnomai to fit through it so our escape pod couldn't have

1640
06:39:08,759 --> 06:39:16,709
flown through here i don't understand how this could be possible but this gruesome place seems

1641
06:39:16,709 --> 06:39:23,180
able to manipulate space itself maybe this was our undoing so to be close to the location of the

1642
06:39:23,180 --> 06:39:30,459
vessel and still go so far is difficult worse the vessel's beacon is dying soon we'll be unable to

1643
06:39:30,459 --> 06:39:35,459
hear it there's nothing we can do now but try to perhaps find a way inside or at least attempt to

1644
06:39:35,459 --> 06:39:41,299
comprehend why this happened my dearest hope is that the other escape pods were able to reach

1645
06:39:41,299 --> 06:40:00,580
relative sits the fucking thing that's on the home planet that's the thing that's on the home

1646
06:40:00,580 --> 06:40:08,360
planet the vessel is the thing on the home planet box box thanks for the raid just i missed it sorry

1647

1648
06:40:15,689 --> 06:40:20,659

1652
06:41:07,419 --> 06:41:19,029
anything else here go back in the ship let's get the hell out here follow that beacon follow that

1653
06:41:19,029 --> 06:42:39,400
beacon right red duplicate signal it's in the red oh hi guys okay go go go faster

1654
06:42:41,669 --> 06:43:12,020
will he smash his head on something uh so two of them show up i'm not sure uh we have to get by

1655
06:43:12,020 --> 06:43:32,169
them is there a way i can kill them or something i learned a lot fossils they turn into fossils but

1656
06:43:32,169 --> 06:43:53,130
how okay my grave survivors from escape pod three follow one of the two vessel beacons to a small

1657
06:43:53,130 --> 06:43:58,569
dark bramble seed but they could go no further they could hear the vessels beacon from i'm sorry

1658
06:43:59,369 --> 06:44:30,229
stupid fucking mike the opening was too small yeah yeah yeah studying an angler fish fossil

1659
06:44:30,229 --> 06:44:49,610
they found on ember twin shit ah i gotta go to the ember twin thing to find out how to evade them

1660
06:44:51,049 --> 06:45:16,090
is it like just is it light is an angler fish fossil on ember twin go to ember twin and find it

1661
06:45:16,729 --> 06:45:53,930
ember twin let's go there's a fossil of one of these on ember twin hopefully it's on the surface

1662
06:45:54,729 --> 06:46:20,259
but didn't i know i've seen it it's in that cave how do i get in that cave i never found out a guy

1663
06:46:20,259 --> 06:46:46,099
is it was way to like drop down is way to drop i think i can drop somewhere i just don't remember

1664
06:46:46,099 --> 06:46:52,700
i know it's in that like that cave system i gotta go down there and look but i can't get there from

1665
06:46:52,700 --> 06:47:34,340
there it's over here above the door where the cannon is here it is all right so theoretically

1666
06:47:34,340 --> 06:47:49,979
here get out of this thing here right no no no no where is it it's like in the rocks up here

1667
06:47:50,939 --> 06:47:58,860
why does it have to be so fucking dark why is it to be so dark unbelievable this is a space game

1668
06:48:00,380 --> 06:48:18,279
okay this is where it is not here what the fuck excuse me i was holding a

1669
06:48:19,240 --> 06:48:38,819
okay now how do i get there from here it's gotta be away wait i i didn't even touch this shit

1670
06:48:39,619 --> 06:49:18,220
i didn't even touch this stuff did i angler fish oh huh angler fish observation tarot deck

1671
06:49:19,799 --> 06:49:28,340
yeah how does this no wait very old specimen what we might learn if we could examine it

1672
06:49:29,060 --> 06:49:32,500
for both grades and luckily this dry plant is hard yeah i don't know i've already looked in here

1673
06:49:35,930 --> 06:49:39,610
i need to get like in i want to get in the observation deck i want to get in the room

1674
06:49:40,169 --> 06:49:52,069
i need to get inside of there clearly this hole is too small for it to have fit through

1675
06:49:52,069 --> 06:49:56,150
there's another entrance to this cave if there is coleus and i will find it we can't leave valley

1676
06:49:56,150 --> 06:50:01,060
below of course there is okay now why can there never be just a front door in this game

1677
06:50:02,549 --> 06:50:09,080
every door is blocked you have to go in a back cave door we need to find a way inside quickly

1678
06:50:09,639 --> 06:50:13,080
because when i returned here there was uh children playing in the specimen

1679
06:50:14,040 --> 06:50:39,000
there's another way in whatever gotta go here comes sand that was too fast

1680
06:50:40,919 --> 06:50:50,220
what's this one stepping stone district there's so much shit here turn them all on

1681
06:50:50,220 --> 06:51:04,259
um high energy lab trailhead what's this one eye shrine district over there let's do one

1682
06:51:04,259 --> 06:51:13,340
at a time here can you give me like a three second window before it becomes available to touch again

1683
06:51:26,779 --> 06:51:31,139
running out of time

1684
06:51:39,900 --> 06:51:45,619
we're meeting in the fossil fish cave to play the game if you're too big to climb through the

1685
06:51:45,619 --> 06:51:53,529
angler fish overlook hole you'll have to go the long way but it isn't far go to the stepping

1686
06:51:53,529 --> 06:52:02,540
stone cave and then up and into the fossil fish cave i tried to get to the fossil fish through the

1687
06:52:02,540 --> 06:52:09,720
stepping stone cave but i couldn't find the entrance where is it remember to feed the fossil

1688
06:52:09,720 --> 06:52:14,599
fish first if you go to the angler fish overlook and throw a light into his mouth he'll show you

1689
06:52:14,599 --> 06:52:19,689
the way what rocket can't fit through the angler fish overlook hole anymore because they grew

1690
06:52:19,689 --> 06:52:29,779
bigger he's taller than levi now who cares it's still i'm still the tallest i'm gonna do one final

1691
06:52:29,779 --> 06:52:36,040
break i'm gonna take auto out and pee and we'll do our last break and hopefully i can get this

1692
06:52:36,040 --> 06:57:17,619
game done in the next hour or so i'll be right back what are you guys fighting why are you guys

1693
06:57:17,619 --> 06:57:37,270
fighting why is everybody fighting hey no food fights no food fights please all right stepping

1694
06:57:37,270 --> 06:57:54,520
stone cave the entrance is feed the fossil fish from light into his mouth stepping stone cave

1695
06:57:59,369 --> 06:58:14,700
okay well the sand is filling up i gotta gotta what is this stepping stone cave i keep having

1696
06:58:14,700 --> 06:58:24,979
these eureka reveal moments in my brain and i say them as i see them although i didn't put the light

1697
06:58:24,979 --> 06:58:43,049
down wait did i shit is it still there all right thank god thank god my my idiot brain actually

1698
06:58:43,049 --> 06:59:20,619
just left it there oh children doing this why were children doing this sand sand am i supposed

1699
06:59:20,619 --> 06:59:33,509
to use the sand how much higher can i go that's not correct that's not correct it's not correct

1700
06:59:33,509 --> 07:00:12,740
it's okay it's just sand how do i get up here the fuck do i just i mean the light he has the

1701
07:00:12,740 --> 07:00:24,779
light going your way the stairs i just was on the stairs all this wasn't i just on them oh i was

1702
07:00:24,779 --> 07:00:40,119
following the scout thing over there i only have three minutes of air what the hell is all this

1703
07:00:41,000 --> 07:00:46,119
are we playing the fossil fish game tonight i fed the fossil fish a new lantern if you go to the

1704
07:00:46,119 --> 07:00:52,150
stepping stone cave the entrance to the fossil fish cave is easy to see now gratitude solenum

1705
07:00:53,159 --> 07:00:57,400
good to see you're small enough to climb in through the hole at the angler fish overlook

1706
07:00:58,360 --> 07:01:04,459
i'm still small enough you won't be for long mom and dad are tall so you and i will be tall too

1707
07:01:06,869 --> 07:01:37,430
must be nice uh i just keep going keep going all the stairs no this is not right that's not right

1708
07:01:38,779 --> 07:01:52,409
stepping stone cave i was i think it's over uh all right it's we're like filled up we're like

1709
07:01:52,409 --> 07:02:01,509
filled up with sand at this point do i have time to do it do i actually have time to do it

1710
07:02:02,630 --> 07:02:08,310
i have time okay well what is it up here i don't remember the doors every single door here is it's

1711
07:02:08,310 --> 07:02:12,709
all the same it's blending together in my brain it's all the same architecture where's it's right

1712
07:02:12,709 --> 07:02:29,799
there i i this is broken there it's in here it's not i don't have any oxygen either i'm dead how

1713
07:02:29,799 --> 07:02:56,520
to die yeah well now i'm gonna go here exactly immediately did i just better get it no uh i'm

1714
07:02:56,520 --> 07:03:08,119
gonna do this i'm just so disoriented down here the cave is just like the same color on either

1715
07:03:08,119 --> 07:03:13,240
side and this like it's just everything melts together in the same pot of same exact image in

1716
07:03:13,240 --> 07:03:20,250
my brain i have this one light in the middle and like the same color on either side of my brain

1717
07:03:21,209 --> 07:03:39,419
right there oh quickly quickly learn the secret learn the secret quickly whoever was

1718
07:03:39,419 --> 07:03:44,779
whoever was it when we ended last time is the anglerfish pickle rule change the anglerfish

1719
07:03:44,779 --> 07:03:54,009
now has to wear a blindfold the rest of us line up against one wall when the anglerfish says go

1720
07:03:54,009 --> 07:04:01,529
the little fish sneak across to the other side the anglerfish catches you you're eaten last little

1721
07:04:01,610 --> 07:04:06,520
fish to be caught is the new anglerfish the old anglerfish gives the new anglerfish the blindfold

1722
07:04:06,520 --> 07:04:11,590
and becomes a little fish why are we changing it it's too hard if you can't see anything

1723
07:04:13,080 --> 07:04:18,759
aunt pie says real anglerfish are blind but you have to wear a blindfold the rule stands

1724
07:04:20,119 --> 07:04:23,189
it's okay if younger kids don't wear the blindfold when they're at it

1725
07:04:23,830 --> 07:04:27,340
the rest of us will still wear it for scientific accuracy and make the game even

1726
07:04:28,299 --> 07:04:44,580
all right so the blind so that what just to go quietly is there anything while i'm still frozen

1727
07:04:44,580 --> 07:04:50,259
here is it any those kids dead holy shit okay what about what's up something up here

1728
07:04:56,060 --> 07:05:11,990
i made it what oh come on really okay i got i learned what i wanted to learn anglerfish are

1729
07:05:11,990 --> 07:05:18,259
blind so i'm assuming i just have to be very quiet when they show up

1730
07:05:18,259 --> 07:05:43,619
so we'll just just turn off the engine just don't move like if they're blind then they

1731
07:05:43,619 --> 07:05:48,659
can hear so they they're gonna i just have to just not move don't make any sounds when

1732
07:05:48,659 --> 07:06:09,270
they're around okay so let's test that hypothesis and let's head back to the bramble to that ship

1733
07:06:09,990 --> 07:06:19,159
for that uh beacon see if we can kind of coast slowly by them

1734
07:06:19,159 --> 07:07:06,470
um okay go in the sun if i keep this trajectory all right take up the stress beacon escape pod

1735
07:07:06,470 --> 07:07:15,580
three and we go that correct all right this should be i'm gonna be quiet is there any is

1736
07:07:15,580 --> 07:07:19,740
how do i be quiet in this thing it's like a big ship with fire and um how do i be quiet

1737
07:07:20,380 --> 07:07:42,619
i wonder if i just if i just don't move but then how do i kind of turn the ship

1738
07:07:43,580 --> 07:07:50,759
it's at the i wonder what's the range of them being able to see or hear me

1739
07:07:51,959 --> 07:08:25,590
okay uh is it just the red one should i just go towards the red one that's just it right

1740
07:08:26,549 --> 07:09:00,459
i don't have to do this whole thing all over again do i all right somebody's hears me i'm just i'm

1741
07:09:00,459 --> 07:09:10,060
not moving where's he go to the left okay he's right next to me is there one right next to me

1742
07:09:10,060 --> 07:09:16,099
to the right all right there he is can i move oh my god i don't know what i don't know the timing

1743
07:09:18,619 --> 07:09:42,599
he was still i thought he was past me the booster is low enough for one bar they won't hear you

1744
07:09:43,560 --> 07:09:54,040
can i look around hold on let me i could like get out hold on this took me like five or six

1745
07:09:54,040 --> 07:10:25,689
five tries i believe i don't know i'm trying to figure it out this is where i gave up

1746
07:10:25,689 --> 07:10:52,409
oh really damn i feel like i want to go fast though like tiptoeing around okay that one

1747
07:10:53,290 --> 07:10:58,490
when you go in the red dot and there's two of them and they go hey don't move there right but i feel

1748
07:10:58,490 --> 07:11:06,939
i feel like if i the slower i am like i'd rather just go in quicker and and i'm looking at chat and

1749
07:11:06,939 --> 07:11:10,060
talking and i'm gonna crash into this and we're gonna have to do the whole fucking thing over again

1750
07:11:10,779 --> 07:11:39,240
a philosophy joke let's be supportive for a change germa you got this don't fuck it up

1751
07:11:40,040 --> 07:11:47,340
it's not really supportive that's more like putting pressure on me you should have said hey you got

1752
07:11:47,340 --> 07:12:37,139
this no not don't fuck it up i wonder where it is i'm just gonna go fast the faster i went last time

1753
07:12:37,139 --> 07:12:57,540
i got through two like just go the last two times i've made it through here i've gone fast is there

1754
07:12:57,540 --> 07:13:06,150
a way to how do i look do i have to unbuckle see like i'm just i just got the fuck in here

1755
07:13:13,029 --> 07:13:21,990
and now is when i just don't fucking move um but wait wait wait wait wait hold on a second

1756
07:13:22,869 --> 07:13:40,330
so how do i i'm gonna bump into his his tendril i'm gonna touch him i'm gonna touch him you can

1757
07:13:40,330 --> 07:13:49,029
direct it wait i have to go don't boost i can move i'm gonna touch him i'm gonna touch him

1758
07:13:49,669 --> 07:14:25,959
oh how did i not touch him i i'm shocked and i can't believe i didn't touch him

1759
07:14:27,560 --> 07:14:57,669
okay almost there floor it i'm not gonna floor it wait okay what is it is it another thing to go in

1760
07:14:57,669 --> 07:15:10,229
is another bramble or is it a vessel is it the vessel i can't see what that is what is that

1761
07:15:10,790 --> 07:15:31,130
it just flew by me what is this i'm not gonna floor it i'm not gonna floor it no flooring it

1762
07:15:31,770 --> 07:15:43,639
there's a bunch of eggs am i the sperm i'm the sperm i knew it this is about making a baby the

1763
07:15:43,639 --> 07:16:03,900
baby's eyes are gonna open it's gonna be a baby okay so what is this what am i doing with this

1764
07:16:04,779 --> 07:17:06,860
am i gonna crash into this what is this eggs what i did i did i pass something hold on do i have a

1765
07:17:06,860 --> 07:17:52,790
beacon i can't break them he didn't scout the vessel pick a hole and go omega lull

1766
07:17:53,669 --> 07:18:26,919
you see people saying i missed a person here i don't see anything that's really weird whatever

1767
07:18:26,919 --> 07:18:39,049
it is like a dna strand so where the vessel is go find that all right it's gonna pick a hole

1768
07:18:43,139 --> 07:18:53,689
wait what are you talking about what are you guys talking about i don't have the scout anywhere

1769
07:18:54,250 --> 07:19:04,540
guys i shot the scout at that i i that that's not i shot the scout onto this

1770
07:19:05,750 --> 07:19:12,220
that's i didn't do the thing i did before the scout i didn't have the scout i didn't do the

1771
07:19:12,220 --> 07:19:19,159
thing i didn't go back and shoot it through the thing you did a hole now just one of these

1772
07:19:19,159 --> 07:19:29,020
fucking things just shoot it into one of these i think i think it has hit i think i just hit

1773
07:19:29,020 --> 07:19:40,700
i think i just hit a fish well wake up if you want to wake already what about right here

1774
07:19:41,340 --> 07:20:21,240
not on that one it's not that one so what i had to have gone back to where they all were dead and

1775
07:20:21,240 --> 07:20:36,900
shot it in there to be able to find where the vessel is i can still find it i mean good luck

1776
07:20:36,900 --> 07:21:01,020
i have to just pick the random one that's correct i'm gonna hit this damn it so so this was so this

1777
07:21:01,020 --> 07:21:17,029
was the fake signal right then they said there was two signals i think i just have to die then

1778
07:21:17,029 --> 07:21:22,919
don't i i have to just like floor it and just die because i don't know i have no idea which

1779
07:21:22,919 --> 07:21:32,099
one's the right one just like this like it doesn't mean he's not there let's have to leave

1780
07:21:34,900 --> 07:21:41,209
there's no distress beacon in here i'm just gonna go in one

1781
07:21:41,930 --> 07:21:55,779
whatever i don't have the the signal like i have to go get the signal and shoot it into the thing

1782
07:21:55,779 --> 07:22:13,659
so i know where it is i might be screwed here yeah i should have done that first i just for some

1783
07:22:13,659 --> 07:22:18,380
reason i thought because i don't know i thought i listened to one guy in chat that said just fly

1784
07:22:18,380 --> 07:22:37,000
to the red light you're fine you can't even get me somebody said you don't have to do that just

1785
07:22:37,000 --> 07:23:05,619
fly to the red light and i was like oh okay you must know what you're talking about all right go

1786
07:23:05,619 --> 07:23:25,529
to escape pod three shoot into the thing go follow the beacon follow the scout that's where i need to

1787
07:23:25,529 --> 07:24:17,740
go now it's time for hard mode no let's go go to the grave fire the thing in sneak past all the

1788
07:24:17,740 --> 07:24:25,450
guards and follow the right beacon should have done that i was gonna do that too i was going to

1789
07:24:26,090 --> 07:24:48,090
i'm actually glad it's an emote only but i can't get fake advice i wonder what seriously the

1790
07:24:48,090 --> 07:24:57,259
percentage of actual real advice is in twitch chats or if people are just saying just typing

1791
07:24:57,259 --> 07:25:00,540
random shit they're just like i don't fucking tell them i'm just gonna see if i can get them to do

1792
07:25:00,540 --> 07:25:12,860
this hey yeah dude uh you you press a three times when you get to the when you get to the grave is

1793
07:25:12,860 --> 07:25:19,849
he gonna do that and they hear they hear this and they're like oh my god what a fucking idiot

1794
07:25:19,849 --> 07:25:30,659
let's go fast i know everyone hates this and so do i but i have to go fast i have to

1795
07:25:31,299 --> 07:26:18,330
grave i thought that was a fish it's just a log it's just a strange looking log okay here we go

1796
07:26:32,310 --> 07:26:54,069
is that a fish or is that a log okay here we go there it is hire the scout in and then follow

1797
07:26:54,069 --> 07:27:32,970
the lights god you're gonna make me fucking throw up what are you it won't go in it won't this shit

1798
07:27:32,970 --> 07:28:40,200
won't follow the lights i did wait no i just have to go to the no i already have it it's already

1799
07:28:40,200 --> 07:28:44,919
there why why did they say all the lights oh no that was we did that already okay yeah i got

1800
07:28:44,919 --> 07:29:02,139
the yeah yeah that was like that i did it in reverse duplicate signal let's go here we go

1801
07:29:02,139 --> 07:29:06,779
just get me in get out of this okay can we get like the star trek ship to get the fuck out of

1802
07:29:06,779 --> 07:29:27,020
my way it's not that way it's down there i'm gonna bump this right have we that's be very

1803
07:29:27,020 --> 07:29:44,619
clear that i'm not gonna bump this shit all right there's the scout wait where's the error duplicate

1804
07:29:44,619 --> 07:30:23,979
scout is that is this still good we're good right i'm going so slow but i can't press a button

1805
07:30:31,610 --> 07:30:35,689
there are the frog eggs there are all the new tadpoles that are going to come out that's fine

1806
07:30:35,689 --> 07:31:02,220
we just go past it is it safe to use thrusters right now is it safe to use thrusters

1807
07:31:03,259 --> 07:31:23,689
no i can hear somebody i just did it a little bit okay don't do it anymore

1808
07:31:28,700 --> 07:31:33,909
oh sorry just floor it try floor it try floor it

1809
07:31:44,939 --> 07:32:14,810
oh all right so we've got 600 meters we're almost there this is the vessel are those things still

1810
07:32:14,810 --> 07:32:47,529
here what do i do get out and fly in it with my body is there a broken entrance or something

1811
07:32:53,500 --> 07:33:05,740
their window broken like over here okay get in here entrance over here this looks like torn up

1812
07:33:05,740 --> 07:33:26,939
can i go in there underneath because the door this is just like a underneath and underneath dude

1813
07:33:27,580 --> 07:33:40,409
what kind of fucked up ship do you fly here what is this fucking thing this this is a lawnmower

1814
07:33:40,409 --> 07:33:53,479
this is not even a ship where how do i get in here you're fucking weed whack a ship i well how

1815
07:33:53,479 --> 07:34:24,259
where do i go take it off emote only give me the answer i don't care get out of this thing before

1816
07:34:24,259 --> 07:34:52,650
it explodes no what at the very top my god this is so disorienting i want to throw up

1817
07:34:58,970 --> 07:35:18,549
right here this gameplay makes me want to puke in fact i probably should go puke wait it's not

1818
07:35:18,549 --> 07:35:55,720
right here there's a giant hole right here oh you dickhead game it was this the whole time this is

1819
07:35:55,720 --> 07:36:03,369
no entrance here this is nothing here to go in oh you gotta be fucking kidding me it's that

1820
07:36:03,369 --> 07:36:24,409
white ass background i was gonna go there first but i was like oh no there's like there's nothing

1821
07:36:24,409 --> 07:36:53,740
there all right what do you got in here what can i read in here turn this on power it up this thing

1822
07:36:54,459 --> 07:37:18,310
all right we're gonna put power somewhere i don't know what that did i guess i don't know i'm gonna

1823
07:37:18,310 --> 07:37:26,360
go travel up here although there's a button to press over there but i'm not gonna press it yet

1824
07:37:26,360 --> 07:37:38,009
it's probably info up here there is why can i just chew on fucking like gravity gum like they do in

1825
07:37:38,009 --> 07:37:44,330
mars attacks this is escal's vessel something went badly wrong during our warp and our vessel

1826
07:37:44,330 --> 07:37:51,459
is mortally wounded we needed help as quickly as possible our vessel appears to have has it

1827
07:37:51,459 --> 07:37:57,830
fused with the local environment somehow there are vines that are now part of the vessel it's

1828
07:37:57,830 --> 07:38:04,389
been torn apart from the inside itself we're abandoning our vessel any nomai clans or space

1829
07:38:04,389 --> 07:38:08,709
flight capable species receiving this message i employ you we need your help well you're all

1830
07:38:08,709 --> 07:38:15,430
dead is this broken can anyone hear me hello our vessel's dying sorry i only have 20 minutes to

1831
07:38:15,430 --> 07:38:43,020
figure this out any nomai clans is best i can hear this message clear the universe is dying

1832
07:38:43,020 --> 07:38:47,740
there are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now so my clan and i believe

1833
07:38:47,740 --> 07:38:55,080
the best option is for all our clans to stay together if you can reach the glooming galaxy

1834
07:38:55,959 --> 07:39:02,360
we found that black rocks suns are fairly stable and life in this star system is thriving we live

1835
07:39:02,360 --> 07:39:10,860
in relative safety well if you prefer you to continue exploring alone know you will be on

1836
07:39:10,860 --> 07:39:18,580
your own hannah we're making our way to you there's a lot of writing on this one they took

1837
07:39:18,580 --> 07:39:23,939
the whole board it's good to hear from you romey we'll watch your vessel we'll watch for your

1838
07:39:23,939 --> 07:39:31,060
vessel has anyone heard from neem his clan was on its way to our vessel but they never arrived and

1839
07:39:31,060 --> 07:39:37,959
he hasn't sent any messages i'm beginning to worry that is unsettling it reminds me of that old myth

1840
07:39:37,959 --> 07:39:47,000
my grandfather used to tell the disappearance of escal remember hearing that story as a child

1841
07:39:47,959 --> 07:39:52,119
one day escal's vessel simply stopped responding the other clan searched and searched but found

1842
07:39:52,119 --> 07:39:58,340
no trace it was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence that's no myth friends

1843
07:39:58,340 --> 07:40:04,819
escal's clan existed and their story was real what a curious event to have passed into myth our

1844
07:40:04,819 --> 07:40:09,380
ancestors ancestors were told that story when they were young are you sure it's true

1845
07:40:15,770 --> 07:40:22,090
fucking goddamn gravity man i swear to god it was a very long time ago but yes my clan's ancestors

1846
07:40:22,090 --> 07:40:35,270
searched for escal's clan for a long time but in the end none of them were none of them were ever

1847
07:40:35,270 --> 07:40:47,029
seen again i hope you aren't comparing escal's story to my clan's vessel all right wrap it off

1848
07:40:47,029 --> 07:40:56,580
guys it got much more board space time to wrap it up neem my friend we feared you were gone

1849
07:40:57,299 --> 07:41:02,470
people gonna start writing on the edge like a little bit like oh fuck i can't fit it

1850
07:41:04,939 --> 07:41:09,500
not yet we aren't but nearly we found trouble during our warp see blame this idiot

1851
07:41:09,819 --> 07:41:14,950
that took this much space right like two or three people took up way too much space here

1852
07:41:18,020 --> 07:41:22,419
we found trouble during our warp the triple suns of the bright spark star system exploded

1853
07:41:22,419 --> 07:41:30,310
and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren't caught in the blast we'll meet you soon

1854
07:41:30,310 --> 07:41:36,340
i'm relieved your clan is safe neem it's good to hear your words any vessels nearby remember

1855
07:41:36,340 --> 07:41:43,259
to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars because yeah blame the guy with the big

1856
07:41:43,259 --> 07:42:24,630
bald ass handwriting you didn't have to have a board this big i press the button warp core

1857
07:42:24,630 --> 07:43:12,040
uh i don't think this thing's broken what the hell is this i have to turn on all the the karen

1858
07:43:12,040 --> 07:43:17,799
stones i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the word i know the

1859
07:43:17,799 --> 07:43:26,979
word i know the word i know the word i have to spell out the coordinates okay it's it's like an l

1860
07:43:26,979 --> 07:44:17,319
right just stop moving like this it's like a weird l sit still i'm holding a this is definitely how

1861
07:44:17,319 --> 07:44:25,240
you spell out those coordinates it's gonna be really hard to do um i don't i don't know what

1862
07:44:25,240 --> 07:44:34,119
they are it's like c yeah i don't i don't know exactly what it looks like warp core is broken

1863
07:44:34,119 --> 07:44:40,340
well is this a warp am i am i warping right now i don't even i probably know this could be the

1864
07:44:40,340 --> 07:44:58,869
fucking microwave i don't have that info i'm not gonna be able to do this regardless but this is

1865
07:44:58,869 --> 07:45:16,459
i get this is where i have to put that in yes the three it's three one two okay i mean can i

1866
07:45:16,459 --> 07:45:22,180
can i place it in here is that like what i'm supposed to do yeah i'm dead anyways all right

1867
07:45:22,180 --> 07:45:29,610
well i found it is there anything else i can see before i die warp core has to go here i don't have

1868
07:45:29,610 --> 07:45:43,049
a warp core i have a broken warp core can i take my ship's warp core do i have a warp core

1869
07:45:43,849 --> 07:45:51,220
oh time's up anyways is there anything else like over here i just dead person there

1870
07:45:51,939 --> 07:46:20,229
i'm going down the hallways i'm all closed goodbye just die i have zero health zero h02 whatever

1871
07:46:21,110 --> 07:46:26,229
okay so i found the vessel there's a broken warp core and that's where you input the coordinates

1872
07:46:27,270 --> 07:46:58,819
i need a warp core i have to go back there with a warp core see what i learned he's definitely not

1873
07:46:58,819 --> 07:47:10,700
gonna finish this tonight really is that much more to do i have the core i just really no way

1874
07:47:13,580 --> 07:47:33,849
you're really close no way though oh here we go there's the vessel activated reset

1875
07:47:33,849 --> 07:47:36,729
pillar on the vessel's bridge there appears to be some sort of input device

1876
07:47:38,090 --> 07:47:41,369
they tried to call for help but the vessel's outgoing message did you know there's a problem

1877
07:47:41,369 --> 07:47:45,930
there the vessel can still hear incoming messages from other nomi vessels the remaining nomi

1878
07:47:45,930 --> 07:48:03,189
clans are regrouping in response to the impending death of the universe right how am i still not

1879
07:48:03,189 --> 07:48:22,409
done black hole forge found a switch in the meldwater district that raises and lowers the

1880
07:48:22,409 --> 07:48:25,290
forge the black hole forge district is the highest district in the hanging city

1881
07:48:26,250 --> 07:48:32,409
no my name poke plan to create a new advanced warp core in the black hole forge no my crafted

1882
07:48:32,409 --> 07:48:37,529
warp cores of black hole forge before delivering them to ash twin that's where we're gonna get one

1883
07:48:44,779 --> 07:48:59,479
all right let's mark it i need where is it it's the brittle brittle bramble whatever it's called

1884
07:49:05,290 --> 07:49:14,500
shard uh black hole forge all right can i um i mark this spend it below the hand i

1885
07:49:14,500 --> 07:49:27,400
had to go to the hanging city i guess i can mark the hanging city let's go have i been to the

1886
07:49:27,400 --> 07:49:36,709
sixth location yes i did that a very very long time ago i did that a long long time like four

1887
07:49:36,709 --> 07:49:47,240
or five hours ago yeah remember that shortcut to the hanging city you know what yep where is it

1888
07:49:47,240 --> 07:49:53,130
i don't remember just tell me i'm your friend you can tell me these things just tell me i'm

1889
07:49:53,130 --> 07:50:01,639
your friend i'm your friend near the north pole we're friends here and it was the river water

1890
07:50:01,639 --> 07:50:19,939
right you and i you and i friend you can tell me where that shortcut north pole river you never

1891
07:50:19,939 --> 07:50:26,380
been to any of my birthday parties yes i have i was in a costume i didn't want to give away my

1892
07:50:26,380 --> 07:50:44,069
identity so i was i came in a costume all right we need the north pole uh it's like the place

1893
07:50:44,069 --> 07:50:57,020
so there's a river flowing through it where is it over here where's that river right here somewhere

1894
07:50:57,020 --> 07:51:14,860
i think let's get out this is the south pole opposite side um oh you were the stripper

1895
07:51:15,740 --> 07:51:21,500
so you ordering a costumed stripper how does that make any sense

1896
07:51:37,720 --> 07:51:39,860
close enough

1897
07:51:49,430 --> 07:52:01,740
okay it's like right here right there's water right here somewhere

1898
07:52:10,250 --> 07:52:28,439
there's that water there it is okay let's go back down let's go to the that city i think

1899
07:52:28,439 --> 07:52:40,979
i just blew up right behind me is that hole

1900
07:52:40,979 --> 07:52:51,500
where the hell is it is it on the it's not on the other side is it the whole other side completely

1901
07:52:53,819 --> 07:53:16,900
isn't a lot of fuel for this shit too okay all right now we need to go to the forge which is

1902
07:53:21,830 --> 07:53:38,659
actually sure to be honest it's up isn't it city the top most level i already read all this

1903
07:53:49,990 --> 07:53:59,909
is there an elevator or something i can fly i can get on over here all the way up there

1904
07:53:59,909 --> 07:54:15,400
can i get up there i gotta do the controls first oh wait yeah those are down here aren't there

1905
07:54:16,840 --> 07:54:42,180
all right press the button there it goes i get on that while moving i'm not gonna use any more

1906
07:54:42,180 --> 07:54:50,919
fuel so now i have to go up up here up up up all the way up can i let me try this one first

1907
07:54:51,720 --> 07:55:01,580
this way maybe i go all the way up up up up up that's as far as i can go

1908
07:55:02,380 --> 07:55:30,099
i'll be even further from here to there another way to get here this way yes this looks right

1909
07:55:30,099 --> 07:55:31,060
this looks kind of correct

1910
07:55:35,830 --> 07:56:26,569
you'll know how do i it is wrong but oh there's what is that thing

1911
07:56:27,529 --> 07:56:44,040
that's a teleporter isn't it where was there a teleporter

1912
07:56:46,409 --> 07:56:57,750
wait i think maybe i can jump and look at it where was the teleporter that goes to here

1913
07:56:58,470 --> 07:57:13,509
it's this white and purple looking place is it over here there's a thing here

1914
07:57:14,630 --> 07:57:25,290
what the hell is a teleporter is it on a different planet there's a couple of teleporters

1915
07:57:26,009 --> 07:57:49,610
do i actually have to go and teleport from a different planet to here why can't i just fly

1916
07:57:50,810 --> 07:58:15,509
hey uh i've been streaming for too long for this what is that what is up here there's something

1917
07:58:15,509 --> 07:58:37,959
else i did everything here where have i seen that cube before i remember standing on it and

1918
07:58:37,959 --> 07:58:49,110
and where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it i'm searching my brain right

1919
07:58:49,110 --> 07:58:57,209
now where is that platform i have to look at brittle ramble when it comes by where is it

1920
07:58:58,169 --> 07:59:21,459
ash twin we're gonna go to ash

1921
07:59:34,630 --> 08:00:01,139
are you going to ash twin yeah that's true how is this not exploded i was trying to just delete

1922
08:00:01,139 --> 08:00:09,669
this and do it again and sleep in a campfire why are you still here explode already

1923
08:00:14,819 --> 08:00:25,369
explode thank you what just get out and repair it

1924
08:00:31,880 --> 08:00:42,279
no no i'm starting over i'm starting over again i think i'm stuck what do you mean isn't it where's

1925
08:00:42,279 --> 08:01:08,150
the eject button there's no eject button i'm almost out now if this thing is stuck back here

1926
08:01:08,150 --> 08:01:34,540
i'm gonna burn myself to death in the fire i don't know i don't know what the campfire is

1927
08:01:35,259 --> 08:01:58,409
i have no idea this will kill me don't worry why is it so hard to die i'm trying to die

1928
08:01:59,209 --> 08:02:39,959
what's in there here comes kazoo ending too all right how long what like a minute two minutes

1929
08:02:40,520 --> 08:02:49,459
how long is too long for me to get to the planet one minute two minutes probably two

1930
08:02:49,939 --> 08:03:34,680
i'm gonna say like two i'm gonna take about three minutes or so to get there okay we are going to

1931
08:03:37,459 --> 08:03:46,150
ash twin we're going to desperately try to find the teleporter to that place teleport to it

1932
08:04:09,689 --> 08:04:16,970
he didn't do the black hole forge thing i'm not i'm gonna be out of time then like i shouldn't

1933
08:04:16,970 --> 08:04:30,150
have slept in the fucking campfire then why did i sleep at the campfire let me just see if this

1934
08:04:30,150 --> 08:05:08,950
works i'm gonna go into the sun i just need a warp core and i can end the what do you

1935
08:05:10,389 --> 08:05:20,200
that almost seems impossible that was that was impossible what just happened i have no idea what

1936
08:05:20,200 --> 08:05:43,049
i don't know use autopilot autopilot flies you into the sun it just puts you in a straight line

1937
08:05:43,049 --> 08:05:57,479
to wherever you're going and just goes straight into the sun all right i'm gonna how fast can i

1938
08:05:57,479 --> 08:06:29,909
do this north pole do the controls teleport these are the real gaming hours

1939
08:06:30,549 --> 08:07:02,569
why is the atmosphere yet sir am i allowed to turn sir this is a wendy's

1940
08:07:16,630 --> 08:07:23,720
so we need to be in north pole i don't is this the north pole it's not we need the north pole

1941
08:07:23,720 --> 08:07:58,860
so here it is this side of the other side it's the other side it's the other side

1942
08:07:59,819 --> 08:08:14,250
side other side is it right there is it right there it's right there that's right okay

1943
08:08:14,970 --> 08:08:25,580
turn on the controls and then come back up here all right so how how do i reliably get back up here

1944
08:08:26,139 --> 08:08:44,439
just go back up that way how hard is it this way this way this way okay then down here

1945
08:08:44,439 --> 08:08:57,299
all right right here turn this shit on going up right okay controls are on let's get back up here

1946
08:09:00,840 --> 08:09:41,060
back up right let's go now we head to the ash quinn find that teleporter stand on

1947
08:09:41,060 --> 08:10:03,659
one let's go move let's go all right it's on the equator but which one it's on the equator it's

1948
08:10:03,659 --> 08:10:38,040
one of those towers on the equator just gotta find the one that has the at white background

1949
08:10:38,040 --> 08:10:47,400
so this is i'm on the this is the equator here i don't see any towers yet don't get hit by the

1950
08:10:49,220 --> 08:11:09,860
thing here all right this one here is it this one here it's here somewhere

1951
08:11:11,540 --> 08:11:24,619
oh looks like a sun all right not this one what about another one what about this

1952
08:11:24,619 --> 08:12:08,360
way what's this one what's this one's shape like does it even have one in it wait this is the

1953
08:12:09,319 --> 08:12:19,880
it's not this one it's not this one it's not this one this is the um this is this plan wait no this

1954
08:12:19,880 --> 08:12:47,520
this is this planet right cuz this is the two pillars let me see now this ain't it

1955
08:12:47,520 --> 08:13:02,819
watch the ground you're gonna see the ground it's not white wrong it needs to be white

1956
08:13:02,819 --> 08:13:26,400
another one okay here it looks like it's coming for me sun shaped tower that's this tower

1957
08:13:26,400 --> 08:13:49,200
then there's this five towers right what's this one that shape like a circle might be

1958
08:13:49,200 --> 08:14:11,840
this one they all teleport to a different place arm of three well there's oxygen here

1959
08:14:11,840 --> 08:14:31,709
thank god there's don't get too cocky here was the last one it's here there should be

1960
08:14:31,709 --> 08:14:39,279
two more one here wait just wait for this to go by so I can have but I can uninterrupt

1961
08:14:39,520 --> 08:15:08,009
yeah here's another one this is another tower hey what's this one this one is this is just a

1962
08:15:08,009 --> 08:15:23,790
spot but wait a minute that's uh this is we need the sand to go down this is not brutal hollow

1963
08:15:23,790 --> 08:15:45,130
though this is like the spike shit it's got to be this one it has to be this one is the sun again

1964
08:15:45,130 --> 08:16:12,799
now this is the Sun I did a full circle were there only four towers did I miss one

1965
08:16:12,799 --> 08:16:31,340
now the sands come in here isn't it I'll drop it that fucking sand

1966
08:16:54,970 --> 08:17:26,619
all right let's go okay brutal hollow wasn't it that's not brutal hollow

1967
08:17:27,580 --> 08:17:49,799
oh here's our first delivery one warp core fresh and black hole core

1968
08:17:51,000 --> 08:18:40,299
sands going up I'm upside down right all right this is it I gotta wait for I gotta wait brutal

1969
08:18:40,299 --> 08:19:17,209
hollow has to be in view hey look at what happened departure time 800 time arrival 800 with a little

1970
08:19:17,209 --> 08:19:30,830
one return warp status charged step onto warp platform when ready black hole forge

1971
08:19:31,959 --> 08:19:56,349
oh okay there it is all right give me my warp core let's just get in here whoops any just

1972
08:19:56,349 --> 08:20:26,909
looking for writing let's go back there's the thing I plugged in it's two I want how much time

1973
08:20:26,909 --> 08:20:56,509
do I have I'm not sure I have enough time Larry and rude kindly tune the alignments on each black

1974
08:20:56,509 --> 08:21:01,150
hole core as I finish them schematic on the floor shows which warp tower aligns with which astro

1975
08:21:01,150 --> 08:21:07,369
body right speed future deliveries to ash twin I've tuned the first black hole core to activate

1976
08:21:07,369 --> 08:21:12,889
when it's a warp tower aligns with brutal hollow before anyone comments yes I am aware this reduces

1977
08:21:12,889 --> 08:21:18,860
the distance between yarrow and me schematic shows the six towers on ash twin are being tuned

1978
08:21:18,860 --> 08:21:25,400
only five alignments a mistake no that's correct for these alignments we've decided to treat the

1979
08:21:25,400 --> 08:21:33,229
hourglass twins as a single astral body right if it helps you can imagine the hourglass twins

1980
08:21:33,229 --> 08:21:38,250
is aligning with themselves have you seen flox's tower designs in the high energy lab on in between

1981
08:21:38,250 --> 08:21:44,029
they clarify each tower is a warp destination yeah we gotta figure that out all right we need

1982
08:21:44,029 --> 08:22:07,439
a warp core projection stone alignment one the sun alignment two hourglass yep alignment three

1983
08:22:07,439 --> 08:22:23,209
timber hearth yeah yep mm-hmm alignment five giants deep alignment for brittle hollow so

1984
08:22:23,209 --> 08:22:33,720
yeah they just correspond yep yep yep okay a little bit more writing here where am I taking

1985
08:22:33,720 --> 08:22:37,799
this first black hole core and where am I taking the remaining cores once they're ready

1986
08:22:39,630 --> 08:22:44,110
all the warp towers are being constructed on ash twins black hole cores will go there

1987
08:22:45,310 --> 08:22:50,119
my gratitude in that case poke larry I'm leaving for delivery I'll send yarrow your regards

1988
08:22:51,000 --> 08:22:55,450
look I returned to the ford shortly I'm going to catch up to root and help them deliver the

1989
08:22:55,450 --> 08:23:03,200
first core to ash twin just make sure yarrow receives it of course the white hole cores are

1990
08:23:03,200 --> 08:23:07,599
for the six warp receivers each warp tower leads to a different planet so that will be a greater

1991
08:23:07,599 --> 08:23:22,270
pain in your cervical spine that was on ash twin so it's just on ash twin somewhere delivered

1992
08:23:23,799 --> 08:23:47,470
someplace I need to find okay let's use the stone and go read I have good news yarrow the advanced

1993
08:23:47,470 --> 08:23:56,810
warp core is ready to be installed at the heart of the ash twin project I'm intrigued love everyone

1994
08:23:56,810 --> 08:24:07,639
on ash twin is excited to see it no it isn't is everything well at the forge don't worry love

1995
08:24:07,639 --> 08:24:11,799
poke is only nervous core is extraordinary and her design work is beautifully clever

1996
08:24:12,439 --> 08:24:17,400
the core's durability could still be improved I need more time ignore her yarrow the core is

1997
08:24:17,400 --> 08:24:22,319
finished and if my sister tells you otherwise then she will be finished as well killing your sister

1998
08:24:22,319 --> 08:24:48,169
what again this thing they're one looking at me why do they why are there two heads

1999
08:25:05,930 --> 08:25:47,439
um okay so now I know that the core is on ash twin I need teleport to ash twin

2000
08:26:15,340 --> 08:26:22,729
but I think I did everything I needed to do up there it's okay there was nothing else for me

2001
08:26:22,729 --> 08:26:29,049
to do up there there's no core up there it was it was on ash twin yeah I could have been way

2002
08:26:29,049 --> 08:26:33,290
more upset about that all right now let's break our legs and our spine

2003
08:26:35,369 --> 08:26:55,549
I'm trying to like scrape my face on that come on just die come on let me catch one of these

2004
08:26:55,549 --> 08:27:36,799
how have I not been hit by any straight power or something okay got a bunch of new info what have

2005
08:27:36,799 --> 08:27:44,479
I not done I don't have very many more connections ash twin is one of the only things that's a

2006
08:27:44,479 --> 08:28:22,720
question mark let's see where we're at now I call forge ash twin that leads to here ash twin

2007
08:28:23,279 --> 08:28:40,270
our designs yeah it's just ash twin so far the vessel has something to explore the ash twin as

2008
08:28:40,270 --> 08:28:46,400
well an advanced warp core was successfully forged and for installation at the heart of

2009
08:28:46,400 --> 08:28:53,040
the ash twin project like in the heart inside of ash twin at the very very middle

2010
08:28:54,000 --> 08:28:59,599
but just have to wait till the thing goes to zero and just go in the middle

2011
08:29:21,470 --> 08:29:49,880
let's try it I'm just I'm gonna just explore and see if I can ash twin I gotta get to the

2012
08:29:49,880 --> 08:30:07,770
heart of the ash twin too fast already I think I saved it how do I get to the heart of the ash

2013
08:30:07,770 --> 08:31:07,439
twin mine the equator yep always on equator okay so I have to get to the core of this

2014
08:31:08,400 --> 08:31:26,509
how is this still aligned I just flew 5 000 feet to the left it's not we're gonna rank

2015
08:31:26,509 --> 08:31:42,599
wink redemption um do I just wait till it gets to the very bottom the sand and just stay here

2016
08:31:43,479 --> 08:31:47,319
and just try to go right to the core right to where like the tootsie roll pop thing is

2017
08:32:13,900 --> 08:32:22,909
that's real this is real wait this is real wait this is real there's only one

2018
08:32:22,909 --> 08:32:37,900
for there's only one warp I know what I have to do there's one warp of both of these planets

2019
08:32:38,779 --> 08:32:49,919
I gotta warp from that one this one or vice versa I gotta work from this one into that one

2020
08:32:49,919 --> 08:33:12,119
let me give that a try I work in I work into myself so if there's the two tower one and I

2021
08:33:12,119 --> 08:33:21,229
warp into it like the fucking name of the goddamn game is called the two tower project of course

2022
08:33:21,229 --> 08:33:28,880
it's going to be the one that's the two the twin the twin tower one go into the twin tower one

2023
08:33:28,880 --> 08:34:06,650
teleport and there it is the ash twin project you'll see let me let me look let me see let me go

2024
08:34:06,650 --> 08:34:17,119
read it while we wait for this the sand to get out of here look ash twin ash twin towers design

2025
08:34:17,680 --> 08:34:55,849
now I got it that's I'm gonna teleport to myself wait for the sand all right there's the sun

2026
08:34:56,810 --> 08:34:59,369
looking for the is it this way or the other way let's see

2027
08:35:01,450 --> 08:35:31,900
there's the sun behind me tribes of scent where are they is it still taking too much time

2028
08:35:32,779 --> 08:35:58,509
where these are the towers come on here we go there are the two towers now I need to wait for

2029
08:35:58,509 --> 08:36:07,840
the sand to get down here and I'm going to teleport look at this there's a teleport thing here

2030
08:36:12,509 --> 08:36:29,520
and there is not one here I gotta stand right here I'm gonna wait until the sand goes over me

2031
08:36:29,520 --> 08:36:32,080
and I'm gonna teleport through into the sand in the yellow

2032
08:36:38,409 --> 08:36:46,720
oh not here I'm talking about one down under the glass speaking of which I gotta get the

2033
08:36:46,720 --> 08:37:29,930
fuck out of the way enough now for me to go okay so wait there's another one there's two

2034
08:37:30,889 --> 08:38:38,909
but this is broken wait is it gonna line am I gonna see it am I gonna see it I might see it

2035
08:38:38,909 --> 08:39:33,340
when is it gonna happen that it hasn't happened the ship is gone now wait here it comes here it

2036
08:39:33,340 --> 08:40:13,209
comes here it is I ow what these are all the faces 10 minutes 40 seconds receive data from previous

2037
08:40:13,209 --> 08:40:20,279
cycles masks receiving data from probe tracking module giant steep memory statue timber hearth

2038
08:40:20,279 --> 08:40:53,000
memory statue 12 minutes until end of cycle transmission I need a thing today we finished

2039
08:40:53,000 --> 08:40:59,240
the excavation of the ash twin here in this space we carved we will craft our most ambitious

2040
08:40:59,240 --> 08:41:10,139
project yet the ash twin project powerful enough to send information back in time how far we've

2041
08:41:10,139 --> 08:41:15,819
come since our experiments at the high energy lab I still can hardly believe Ramy's hypothesis was

2042
08:41:15,819 --> 08:41:23,470
true we've also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging

2043
08:41:24,430 --> 08:41:28,220
we'll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we've altered the environment here

2044
08:41:29,259 --> 08:41:40,400
oak just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the black hole forge now ash twin can

2045
08:41:40,400 --> 08:41:47,659
be connected with giants deep the cassava is working with havens to craft the orbital probe

2046
08:41:47,659 --> 08:41:55,419
cannon and with blocks of sculpting the memory statues hypothesis it was not by accident the

2047
08:41:55,500 --> 08:42:02,919
core of our warp tower was the last to be forged cores could have been forged faster

2048
08:42:03,639 --> 08:42:09,880
saba had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates the important point is we are

2049
08:42:09,880 --> 08:42:17,479
all connected through the ash twin now we made the internet is what they're saying and also that

2050
08:42:17,479 --> 08:42:34,990
i'm no longer needed for mediating your disagreements our friends on giant steep tested the orbital probe

2051
08:42:34,990 --> 08:42:41,310
cannon today malo tells me the cannon is doing well and that havens advocates more launch power

2052
08:42:41,310 --> 08:42:49,319
if anyone can coax the maximum power from a device havens can then if anyone can go to device into

2053
08:42:49,319 --> 08:42:54,200
exploding that too is likely havens perhaps i should check in with the oracle probe cannon crew

2054
08:42:54,200 --> 08:43:01,720
in the interest of safety would help to remind havens that malo his love will be one of the

2055
08:43:01,799 --> 08:43:04,840
nomi on board the cannon or is malo part of the problem

2056
08:43:08,220 --> 08:43:11,500
fox and dad's finished the memory statues today and they are truly remarkable

2057
08:43:12,459 --> 08:43:16,860
when the ash twin project succeeds or in the event that it fails the memory statues will activate

2058
08:43:17,900 --> 08:43:20,779
allowing us to gather more data before we shut down the project

2059
08:43:25,049 --> 08:43:31,610
high-end idea i've worked hard on the sun station and it is at last is complete everything goes as

2060
08:43:31,610 --> 08:43:36,970
planned the structure will prompt the sun's explosion which will in turn supply the power

2061
08:43:36,970 --> 08:43:53,340
the ash twin project requires my boomer belt activated okay when i press by their mental

2062
08:43:53,340 --> 08:44:02,080
fortitude this was the project's most difficult task in more ways than one we're nearly ready

2063
08:44:02,080 --> 08:44:06,959
to activate the ash twin project here is what will happen first the sun station will receive

2064
08:44:06,959 --> 08:44:12,750
the order to fire at the sun prompting it to explode using the energy from the resulting

2065
08:44:13,389 --> 08:44:17,709
ash twin project will send the order for the orbital probe cannon to fire back in time by

2066
08:44:17,709 --> 08:44:24,169
22 minutes exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received the sun station will again trigger

2067
08:44:24,169 --> 08:44:36,029
the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon's launch back in time in total each

2068
08:44:36,029 --> 08:44:40,830
cycle created by the ash twin project will last precisely 22 minutes we can end this cycle it

2069
08:44:40,830 --> 08:44:53,819
will these words are difficult to write the sun station did not work suppose we redesign the sun

2070
08:44:53,819 --> 08:44:59,099
station to generate power of that magnitude a supernova is still our only viable option

2071
08:45:00,139 --> 08:45:08,240
this is easier expressed than accomplished you can wait for the sun to explode on its natural

2072
08:45:08,240 --> 08:45:13,279
timeline if you prefer idea but you'll need to find some way to halt our aging process

2073
08:45:14,560 --> 08:45:19,369
i believe we can still find a way to create a supernova my friend don't lose hope

2074
08:45:20,409 --> 08:45:24,889
however this is the closest we have ever been the ash twin projects theoretically sound

2075
08:45:25,610 --> 08:45:35,599
we were only unable to power it perhaps there is another way final drawing we are halting our

2076
08:45:35,599 --> 08:45:42,479
research into creating a supernova for this moment comet has newly arrived in this solar system we're

2077
08:45:42,479 --> 08:45:46,959
anxious to explore it it's been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new

2078
08:45:49,500 --> 08:45:53,419
so we're excited to welcome this comet imagine what knowledge might be gained there

2079
08:45:54,220 --> 08:46:10,169
oh my god there's a lot of stones install the masks inside the ash twin project blocks

2080
08:46:10,169 --> 08:46:17,340
they look beautiful although i feel like i'm being observed it's comforting to know the statues will

2081
08:46:17,340 --> 08:46:22,619
not pair until the project succeeds otherwise i imagine the experience would be hard to endure

2082
08:46:22,619 --> 08:46:28,349
i read this already daily they only need to activate once the project succeeds as a safety

2083
08:46:28,349 --> 08:46:34,509
measure however the statues will also activate in the event of equipment failure they will why is

2084
08:46:34,509 --> 08:46:39,790
that if anything goes wrong with the astron the statues and the mass will make us aware of the

2085
08:46:39,790 --> 08:46:44,029
situation and enable us to fix it otherwise it would be possible for us to remain permanently

2086
08:46:44,029 --> 08:46:47,630
unaware of the problem i hadn't thought of that what a profoundly hurtful fate

2087
08:46:50,360 --> 08:47:06,200
we're trying to be trying to fix it okay it's just it's it's the total recap this ore should

2088
08:47:06,200 --> 08:47:11,000
be the last we'll need for the ash twin project it's exciting news can i offer an extra set of

2089
08:47:11,240 --> 08:47:17,080
this final check delighted to help be grateful if you would the more eyes the better

2090
08:47:18,680 --> 08:47:24,250
once we finish the shell that seals off the core we'll check to ensure there are no longer any

2091
08:47:24,250 --> 08:47:30,220
physical entrances ramie and i will be checking the interior and then the exterior for cracks our

2092
08:47:30,220 --> 08:47:53,020
final safety check mr lore wall where i think i've seen the rest of these almost prepared to

2093
08:47:53,020 --> 08:48:04,520
receive the probe data yeah we've seen these yep yep yep i'm looking for the eye of the universe

2094
08:48:04,520 --> 08:48:20,240
like i got these old i have good news the advanced warp core is ready to be installed

2095
08:48:20,240 --> 08:48:26,159
to the heart of the ash twin project is where i am no it isn't yes it is everything well to forge

2096
08:48:26,159 --> 08:48:42,520
don't worry yeah we read this like five minutes ago okay we're good artificial gravity control

2097
08:48:46,569 --> 08:49:23,919
um wonderful i activate first wait that's what hold on this is the teleporter to over there

2098
08:49:27,229 --> 08:50:04,169
turn on this wait we're flying around you're about to access the core while the ash twin

2099
08:50:04,169 --> 08:50:30,639
project is active removing the core will disable the ash twin project what there it is i got it

2100
08:50:31,200 --> 08:51:20,299
okay now we have to we gotta leave now i have the core i've got it i've got the core to power the

2101
08:51:20,299 --> 08:51:48,169
ship let's go where's the ship i gotta go put this in the core i don't know where to put it

2102
08:51:49,209 --> 08:52:13,880
i don't know where to put it in my ship all right it's going in my ship i can't i can't get to where

2103
08:52:13,880 --> 08:52:29,709
this needs to go fast enough i can't get to where it needs to go fast enough but wait hold on wait

2104
08:52:29,709 --> 08:52:43,130
the project isn't going buckle up there's no supernova don't fly into the fucking sun don't

2105
08:52:43,130 --> 08:52:58,729
fly into the fucking sun the fuck just hit me okay now i gotta go um um i have to fly to dark

2106
08:52:58,729 --> 08:53:20,189
ramble wait why is everything getting sucked into the sun throw it into the sun no what throw

2107
08:53:20,189 --> 08:54:11,770
the core into the sun where's dark ramble this music is driving me crazy okay i need to shoot

2108
08:54:12,569 --> 08:54:24,360
the um i need to shoot the thing into the beacon to get to the vessel so i can get there right

2109
08:54:25,159 --> 08:54:37,180
i have to shoot the beacon into the thing i'm going 15 trillion miles per hour

2110
08:54:37,740 --> 08:55:07,630
oh my god oh my god just don't get in no okay i need to mark the distress signal on my

2111
08:55:07,630 --> 08:55:17,930
on my i'm gonna mark the distress signal on my thing yep where's the vessel uh the the this here

2112
08:55:18,889 --> 08:55:42,060
okay all right we're good wait no i don't i found it already i already found it i found it already

2113
08:55:42,060 --> 08:56:14,700
uh the fish are still here though so i can still die from a fish if i die from a fish

2114
08:56:15,419 --> 08:56:22,200
i'm gonna be really mad if i crash into something and explode i'm gonna be really mad

2115
08:56:23,000 --> 08:56:40,220
what are the symbols i gotta look at my notes but here's the thing i have all the time in the world

2116
08:56:46,590 --> 08:57:05,119
i could just coast for like three hours that's what i'm gonna do oh you motherfucker

2117
08:57:05,840 --> 08:58:25,240
what's going on did i hear something why did it explode i disabled the project yeah so it

2118
08:58:25,240 --> 08:58:47,400
couldn't blow up let's just go get it and let's get the fuck let's go do i have it what if i still

2119
08:58:47,400 --> 08:59:21,439
had it in my inventory all right let's get it so we get it we get the hell out of here get in the

2120
08:59:21,439 --> 08:59:29,229
ship go go go go speaking of go all right we're gonna try this one again fucking just crash into

2121
08:59:29,229 --> 08:59:41,479
it you dumbass i have to time i have to i have to speed up time anyways so you know what just

2122
08:59:42,279 --> 08:59:45,740
just do it i fucking have to speed up sleep

2123
09:00:03,290 --> 09:00:07,599
what it takes to fucking destroy a goddamn ship i won't i'll never know

2124
09:00:09,419 --> 09:00:20,880
i have to make i have to sit at the fire the fireplace like three four minutes i gotta sit

2125
09:00:20,880 --> 09:00:30,439
at the fireplace so that i don't stand around for five minutes ten minutes i thought i had all the

2126
09:00:31,400 --> 09:01:04,090
world emote only we can't help him but we can't hurt him either i'm gonna do four minutes i also

2127
09:01:04,090 --> 09:01:16,360
want to look at what the symbols are because i'm not gonna have very much time i didn't do

2128
09:01:16,360 --> 09:01:39,520
anything a zit just popped on my forehead i didn't do anything i didn't touch it one more for all

2129
09:01:39,520 --> 09:02:11,419
time's sake no no i wanted a marshmallow get me out of here what are the symbols no fuck it no all

2130
09:02:11,419 --> 09:02:35,279
right just just go to the planet we could just look up teleport to that weird place grab the

2131
09:02:35,279 --> 09:02:44,959
core park the ship in a safe spot get the hell to the bramble and go by the way there were two

2132
09:02:44,959 --> 09:02:51,180
errors there was an error in error it's it's the red one then the white one right you can help me

2133
09:02:51,180 --> 09:03:24,959
out on this i don't care help me please i'm so close there's a wink all right this is not the

2134
09:03:24,959 --> 09:04:21,119
right one oh get me in there this is a blindfold run um yeah pretty tough it's the broken one

2135
09:04:22,000 --> 09:04:30,459
come on get me in before the whole cycle goes through i've got to grab this

2136
09:04:31,259 --> 09:04:35,069
okay here we go got to grab that warp port

2137
09:05:04,970 --> 09:05:26,759
why is it not happening this time um why did it not happen

2138
09:05:30,360 --> 09:05:59,279
why did it not happen i didn't jump i didn't jump i got what what okay sir but honest to god

2139
09:05:59,279 --> 09:06:05,770
what happened to myself do i have to bump my head and then fall back down

2140
09:06:15,360 --> 09:06:19,199
sand pulled you off of it well how are you supposed to stay on this how are you supposed

2141
09:06:19,199 --> 09:06:41,260
to stand still sand's gonna do this every time i even reach it from here

2142
09:06:41,260 --> 09:06:50,970
i like to throw myself into space it's kind of but it's not gonna help

2143
09:06:52,569 --> 09:07:30,779
please just do this okay that's i missed the cycle i'm losing a lot of time here too though

2144
09:07:30,779 --> 09:07:36,379
and now i have to wait oh god damn it i have to reset the whole thing can i get in there and do

2145
09:07:36,379 --> 09:08:05,389
it right now just the sand went up more well here we go so i i have to stand in this here so i don't

2146
09:08:05,389 --> 09:08:18,300
get sucked up and then go just go like this wait under the lip here that's that's come on

2147
09:08:19,529 --> 09:09:02,830
that that is a like dot dot dot come dot dot dot on you know like come on this is gonna stop me

2148
09:09:03,629 --> 09:09:57,129
am i in the right spot stand on the blue i no stand under the thing okay here we go

2149
09:09:57,129 --> 09:10:36,430
one two three are you sure you want to proceed yes windows fucking authorization bullshit

2150
09:10:37,870 --> 09:11:04,889
okay okay okay

2151
09:11:30,720 --> 09:12:05,870
what the fuck is happening i turned on autopilot started reading a book let's go wait wait wait

2152
09:12:05,870 --> 09:12:18,989
what hold on can i teleport to dark dark teleport dark bramble try teleport dark bramble no okay

2153
09:12:18,989 --> 09:12:47,919
and we've confirmed we've confirmed it's red first and then white right just red no white then red

2154
09:12:48,239 --> 09:12:54,160
my god i'm going really fast i'm sorry i have to fucking look at chat i tell you it's that's

2155
09:12:54,160 --> 09:13:00,489
fucking stressful is it red white then red please tell me the truth please tell me the truth don't

2156
09:13:00,489 --> 09:13:08,730
lie to me i'm not now all the marker that's what i'm saying there's two markers red okay i'm going

2157
09:13:08,730 --> 09:13:46,480
to listen to fucking six of you no why is the end of the game like this

2158
09:13:47,440 --> 09:14:11,690
uh i can't even go fast in there because the angler fish are in there and now i have to do

2159
09:14:11,690 --> 09:14:25,239
this all over again i can't i got a checkpoint with this fucking stupid thing in my hand

2160
09:14:25,879 --> 09:15:15,709
i didn't use a campfire thank god germa doesn't have a real job why because it's late yes oh

2161
09:15:17,069 --> 09:15:24,110
let me go over here let me assess you as a person so it is in the video game out of wild it seems

2162
09:15:24,110 --> 09:15:28,669
that you have you didn't go quickly to the red dot fast enough for me to i'm sorry gonna have

2163
09:15:28,669 --> 09:15:33,709
to dock you a few points a second restaurant waiter i can't believe it yeah i just i couldn't

2164
09:15:33,709 --> 09:15:53,610
i couldn't believe it yeah no no no i was going over your i was going over your resume guy that

2165
09:15:53,610 --> 09:16:01,529
drives a bus and uh how come you didn't see the there was more writing that was on the wall there

2166
09:16:01,610 --> 09:16:08,410
that you didn't you didn't look at i'm upset by this therefore you can no longer drive a bus

2167
09:16:08,410 --> 09:16:33,690
oh yeah wrong fucking planet i can't even drive a bus all right i'm gonna try this one more time

2168
09:16:33,690 --> 09:16:49,099
and i'm gonna youtube the ending it's been almost nine and a half hours don't you dare what does it

2169
09:16:49,099 --> 09:16:57,290
really matter if i youtube the last eight minutes of the game i'm gonna i'm youtubeing it i'm gonna

2170
09:16:57,290 --> 09:17:04,510
youtube it i can't believe i have to fly through bramble place again i'm youtubeing it i'm gonna

2171
09:17:04,510 --> 09:17:15,930
youtube.com slash fucking no you know i'm just gonna open up the wikipedia page of this game and

2172
09:17:15,930 --> 09:17:40,000
just read the end and one sentence am i still on the equator yes oh my god i just want to be done

2173
09:17:53,610 --> 09:17:54,730
this is is it far enough

2174
09:18:35,050 --> 09:18:43,529
please man i just can i fucking just shut the warp core i can't even go wait no god exists god

2175
09:18:43,529 --> 09:19:09,099
exists it's gonna fall back down to us where am i fuck me man i have i need that ship to fly to the

2176
09:19:09,099 --> 09:19:23,900
bramble place you still didn't watch like a deer in headlights yeah because i'm at the end of the

2177
09:19:23,900 --> 09:19:31,709
tunnel and the tunnel has no oxygen in it and i have to go through it and hold my breath and

2178
09:19:31,709 --> 09:19:55,980
fucking just try i'm trying it one more time just read game boomers instead i'm at the final part

2179
09:19:55,980 --> 09:20:07,309
of the game this is actually the end of the whole game this is the it i just have to do this i just

2180
09:20:07,309 --> 09:20:21,709
have to wait for the stupid fucking god damn it i'm going to bed somebody said that they didn't

2181
09:20:21,709 --> 09:20:37,500
have campfires before a patch how many times have they patched the end of this game three times

2182
09:20:37,500 --> 09:21:06,000
they've patched this game four times for the end of the game this is gonna be the one

2183
09:21:37,879 --> 09:21:45,480
he hates us he hates this game he hates everything no it's just it's just having to

2184
09:21:45,480 --> 09:22:12,959
fly through the bramble place again and get eaten by a fucking monster kind of sucks you're not

2185
09:22:12,959 --> 09:22:37,279
gonna actually kill me again all right is autopilot gonna kill me here autopilot was going really

2186
09:22:37,279 --> 09:22:47,040
really fast and it was gonna go right into the sun all right can i not make it like 30 for 30

2187
09:22:47,040 --> 09:23:14,330
landing right on the equator that would be great if i that would be fantastic get me the fuck out

2188
09:23:14,330 --> 09:23:45,480
of this boat all right now i got another minute or two it's the one after the sun

2189
09:23:58,809 --> 09:24:25,400
uh who's your favorite girl from what love lied i don't i don't know what that is i'm gonna say

2190
09:24:25,400 --> 09:24:36,959
i'm gonna just say um all right let's get it first try let's get the hell out of this

2191
09:24:37,680 --> 09:24:56,669
and then put this thing in and then i also need to type in the code so what's the code

2192
09:24:57,389 --> 09:25:13,129
don't worry about the code i have to write this code down don't i which one's broken come on

2193
09:25:17,760 --> 09:25:21,360
where's the mechanic where i can smash my fucking head into the wall and have

2194
09:25:21,360 --> 09:26:33,180
10 minutes go by okay let's go so have we confirmed red then white then red or white then red then

2195
09:26:33,180 --> 09:27:01,879
white because there's two fake ones yes i know put it on all right come on let's go technically

2196
09:27:01,879 --> 09:27:35,690
either will work the white one avoids the fish okay here we go where's my ship where is it

2197
09:27:36,650 --> 09:27:59,069
far away right here okay coordinates set them set them here we go this is the one

2198
09:27:59,949 --> 09:28:37,529
we're going white first and then i'm going to try to float gracefully into red going too slow

2199
09:28:37,529 --> 09:28:42,879
the one time that i'm going too slow we're going red first and then we're going to gracefully

2200
09:28:42,879 --> 09:28:47,400
float into you guys told me let's go just i'm not looking at chat no more chatting no more

2201
09:28:47,400 --> 09:28:54,540
chatting no more chatting no more chatting no more chat for me oh my fucking god i gotta make

2202
09:28:54,540 --> 09:29:04,760
it a good shot red but there's a fucking there could be a fish right there there's a fish

2203
09:29:04,760 --> 09:29:28,160
next to me or something there's a fish i can't move there's a fish don't pump them i have to

2204
09:29:28,160 --> 09:29:40,589
bump anybody don't pump anybody okay there's the vessel 1.2 kilometers that way don't fucking

2205
09:29:40,589 --> 09:29:47,419
floor it no how much time do i have anybody have any ideas like 10 seconds 30 like 10 minutes

2206
09:29:47,419 --> 09:29:53,419
one minute five minutes floor it i can't floor it i can't floor i can't flour it there's everywhere

2207
09:29:53,419 --> 09:30:02,480
i don't know where to go i can't floor it i'm going too slow i can't floor it i can't

2208
09:30:02,480 --> 09:30:15,819
or you're a coward floor it i motherfuck i can't floor it you're gonna run out of time i'm gonna

2209
09:30:16,699 --> 09:30:56,440
i have to move a little bit is it safe here fish here fish here fish pull the fish here nope

2210
09:30:56,440 --> 09:31:09,019
No fish here, there's no fish here.

2211
09:31:09,019 --> 09:31:10,059
Floor it, floor it, floor it.

2212
09:31:10,059 --> 09:31:12,779
Get in, get in, and just go and type in the code.

2213
09:31:12,779 --> 09:31:13,660
What's the code?

2214
09:31:23,660 --> 09:31:24,819
Am I in it?

2215
09:31:24,819 --> 09:31:28,160
I'm like tilted.

2216
09:31:28,160 --> 09:31:35,150
Am I in it?

2217
09:31:35,150 --> 09:31:39,989
No, no, no, no, wrong way, wrong way.

2218
09:31:39,989 --> 09:31:42,569
There it is, there it is.

2219
09:31:42,569 --> 09:31:43,769
Ah!

2220
09:31:43,769 --> 09:31:45,510
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2221
09:31:45,510 --> 09:31:47,430
Put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in,

2222
09:31:47,430 --> 09:31:49,190
put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in,

2223
09:31:49,190 --> 09:31:50,669
put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in, put it in.

2224
09:31:50,669 --> 09:31:54,389
Okay, slow down, whoa, Betsy.

2225
09:31:54,389 --> 09:31:58,169
Slow down, put it in.

2226
09:31:58,489 --> 09:32:06,080
I can't see you.

2227
09:32:06,080 --> 09:32:10,550
Now is not the time for the, you would have to,

2228
09:32:10,550 --> 09:32:12,830
what the fuck is going on right now?

2229
09:32:12,830 --> 09:32:13,669
Is there any?

2230
09:32:19,919 --> 09:32:21,000
Quartets.

2231
09:32:21,000 --> 09:32:22,040
Okay, quartets, R.

2232
09:32:32,129 --> 09:32:32,970
Is that it?

2233
09:32:32,970 --> 09:32:33,790
That's it, right?

2234
09:32:33,790 --> 09:32:39,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

2235
09:32:39,800 --> 09:32:40,919
How do I say yes?

2236
09:32:40,919 --> 09:32:52,339
How do I accept?

2237
09:32:52,339 --> 09:32:53,459
Put it in the bottom left.

2238
09:32:53,459 --> 09:33:00,750
Go down to the, then to the right.

2239
09:33:00,750 --> 09:33:06,050
This next one is, oh my God, here, here, here, here.

2240
09:33:06,610 --> 09:33:09,769
Here, confirm.

2241
09:33:09,769 --> 09:33:11,250
Last one is all fucked up.

2242
09:33:11,250 --> 09:33:12,849
Last one's all fucked up.

2243
09:33:12,849 --> 09:33:14,809
Let me get it right.

2244
09:33:14,809 --> 09:33:20,620
Bottom left corner, bottom left corner.

2245
09:33:20,620 --> 09:34:01,480
Up, around the whole thing, down.

2246
09:34:01,480 --> 09:34:08,120
Looks like we made it, excellent job.

2247
09:34:08,120 --> 09:34:10,040
You finally found the core,

2248
09:34:10,040 --> 09:34:14,400
meaning the eye of the universe.

2249
09:34:14,400 --> 09:34:24,500
I might not have time, I don't care about jokes.

2250
09:34:24,500 --> 09:34:32,639
I might actually not have time for this.

2251
09:34:32,639 --> 09:34:33,480
How are this?

2252
09:35:29,080 --> 09:35:37,589
What is that?

2253
09:35:37,589 --> 09:35:54,959
That's the sun.

2254
09:35:54,959 --> 09:36:13,919
Oh, it's those rocks, it's the quantum rocks.

2255
09:36:13,919 --> 09:36:27,290
Why is this thing making human noises?

2256
09:36:27,290 --> 09:36:31,440
What are you doing?

2257
09:36:31,440 --> 09:36:54,459
Oxygen refueling.

2258
09:36:54,459 --> 09:36:59,839
Ah, I'm doing that, you're trying to block me.

2259
09:36:59,839 --> 09:37:02,279
Okay, there's an opening up here.

2260
09:37:27,410 --> 09:37:29,000
What?

2261
09:37:29,000 --> 09:37:29,839
Go down the toilet?

2262
09:37:43,319 --> 09:37:58,940
Can I stand on this?

2263
09:37:58,940 --> 09:38:00,000
Connection lost.

2264
09:38:19,110 --> 09:38:36,250
Um, fuck.

2265
09:38:42,000 --> 09:38:42,919
I just jump in it?

2266
09:38:45,919 --> 09:38:51,989
Wait.

2267
09:39:04,839 --> 09:39:12,319
Imagine if I died.

2268
09:39:12,319 --> 09:39:17,480
I would fucking laugh so hard.

2269
09:39:17,480 --> 09:39:23,010
I think I can climb that.

2270
09:39:23,010 --> 09:39:33,760
Hold on, I can get there from here.

2271
09:39:33,760 --> 09:39:35,580
Oh, oh, it goes upside down.

2272
09:39:42,589 --> 09:39:45,230
Me and my custom switch remote.

2273
09:39:45,230 --> 09:39:48,190
One of my Joy-Cons, the right Joy-Con.

2274
09:39:48,190 --> 09:40:01,559
Brought it this far.

2275
09:40:01,559 --> 09:40:04,239
Wink, we're literally at the fucking big reveals.

2276
09:40:13,680 --> 09:40:31,099
Child's Adventures was founded by Feldspar,

2277
09:40:31,099 --> 09:40:32,620
Goss and Slade and Hornfels to explore

2278
09:40:32,620 --> 09:40:49,769
the solar system at the end of the universe.

2279
09:40:49,769 --> 09:40:51,610
The Nomai never got to see it for themselves,

2280
09:40:51,610 --> 09:40:53,730
but thanks to their efforts and technology,

2281
09:40:53,730 --> 09:41:15,419
a hearthene was able to reach the eye of the universe.

2282
09:41:15,419 --> 09:41:16,339
At the end of its lifespan,

2283
09:41:16,339 --> 09:41:18,099
our sun collapsed on its own gravity

2284
09:41:18,099 --> 09:41:24,400
and then exploded in a violent supernova.

2285
09:41:24,400 --> 09:41:52,849
You're really fucking ruining this ending, aren't you?

2286
09:41:52,849 --> 09:41:54,330
The Nomai who came to our solar system

2287
09:41:54,330 --> 09:41:57,089
were following a signal from the eye of the universe.

2288
09:41:57,089 --> 09:41:59,449
It perished when the interloper arrived,

2289
09:41:59,449 --> 09:42:00,889
bringing with it the deadly substance

2290
09:42:00,889 --> 09:42:02,930
we call the ghost matter

2291
09:42:02,930 --> 09:42:04,650
that flooded the entire solar system

2292
09:42:04,650 --> 09:42:34,290
almost instantly and without warning.

2293
09:42:34,290 --> 09:42:46,220
Missed the plaque.

2294
09:42:46,220 --> 09:42:48,040
Of all the life forms who will perish

2295
09:42:48,040 --> 09:42:49,720
in the oncoming death of the universe,

2296
09:42:49,720 --> 09:42:58,209
we will miss the anglerfish the least.

2297
09:42:58,209 --> 09:43:17,160
I mean, fairly rude.

2298
09:43:17,160 --> 09:43:18,839
Hornfels observations.

2299
09:43:18,839 --> 09:43:19,680
This is incredible.

2300
09:43:19,680 --> 09:43:20,680
At first I thought the points of light

2301
09:43:20,680 --> 09:43:22,279
in this image were stars, but they're not.

2302
09:43:22,279 --> 09:43:24,120
They're galaxies.

2303
09:43:24,120 --> 09:43:26,239
And this image covers just a tiny patch of the whole sky,

2304
09:43:26,239 --> 09:43:27,480
which means the universe contains

2305
09:43:27,480 --> 09:43:29,239
at least a thousand times more galaxies

2306
09:43:29,239 --> 09:43:31,279
than we previously thought.

2307
09:43:31,440 --> 09:43:34,069
I think I need to sit down.

2308
09:43:34,069 --> 09:43:34,910
This is odd.

2309
09:43:34,910 --> 09:43:36,989
According to my redshift calculations,

2310
09:43:36,989 --> 09:43:40,510
every single galaxy in this image is moving away from us.

2311
09:43:40,510 --> 09:43:41,949
In fact, the farther away a galaxy is,

2312
09:43:41,949 --> 09:43:44,470
the faster it appears to be moving away.

2313
09:43:44,470 --> 09:43:47,669
Almost as if the entire universe is expanding.

2314
09:43:47,669 --> 09:43:48,949
But that's true.

2315
09:43:48,949 --> 09:43:51,069
Was everything closer together in the past?

2316
09:43:51,069 --> 09:43:52,910
And how far back can we extrapolate?

2317
09:43:52,910 --> 09:43:54,669
Did the universe have a beginning?

2318
09:44:52,050 --> 09:44:52,889
Ow!

2319
09:45:04,519 --> 09:45:24,059
I'm just in a forest now.

2320
09:45:24,099 --> 09:45:34,819
That's pretty, yeah.

2321
09:45:34,819 --> 09:45:36,379
I was planning, I hear somebody playing something.

2322
09:45:36,379 --> 09:45:38,279
What's over there?

2323
09:45:38,279 --> 09:46:06,279
It's a blue.

2324
09:46:06,279 --> 09:46:11,750
When do I get to go home?

2325
09:46:11,750 --> 09:47:05,319
This is a dinosaur track.

2326
09:47:05,319 --> 09:47:36,540
A quantum campfire?

2327
09:47:36,540 --> 09:48:03,389
Did I just spit that into my helmet?

2328
09:48:03,389 --> 09:48:05,550
Hi, Phil, whatever your name is.

2329
09:48:05,550 --> 09:48:18,089
Esker, do you hear music?

2330
09:48:18,089 --> 09:48:54,500
Did I be hearing music?

2331
09:48:54,500 --> 09:49:47,339
Is somebody in here?

2332
09:49:47,339 --> 09:50:03,620
Gather, I have a banjo.

2333
09:50:03,620 --> 09:50:09,800
I guess I'm gonna bring it back to you.

2334
09:50:09,800 --> 09:50:19,150
You can have this.

2335
09:50:19,150 --> 09:50:21,910
You're here.

2336
09:50:21,910 --> 09:50:23,510
It's not quite time yet.

2337
09:50:23,510 --> 09:50:25,669
I'm pretty sure we'll need the others for this next part.

2338
09:50:25,669 --> 09:50:27,709
We'll need, you know, everyone.

2339
09:50:27,709 --> 09:50:28,870
Don't rush, take your time.

2340
09:50:28,870 --> 09:50:30,709
It might not even exist here.

2341
09:50:37,459 --> 09:50:38,900
All right, I'm gonna fucking quantum yeet

2342
09:50:38,900 --> 09:50:40,339
these motherfuckers out of here in a second.

2343
09:50:40,339 --> 09:51:11,319
Here we go.

2344
09:51:11,319 --> 09:51:13,669
Hi, can I die here?

2345
09:51:13,669 --> 09:51:37,239
Can I die here?

2346
09:51:37,239 --> 09:51:38,080
I don't get it.

2347
09:51:38,080 --> 09:51:44,559
Why am I gathering all these random people?

2348
09:51:44,559 --> 09:51:45,959
Feldspar, Hatchling, you found me.

2349
09:51:45,959 --> 09:51:47,559
Nice to have company around a campfire, isn't it?

2350
09:51:47,559 --> 09:51:48,400
Go on, get the others.

2351
09:51:48,400 --> 09:51:49,239
Wouldn't you want them?

2352
09:51:49,239 --> 09:51:50,720
I wouldn't want them to miss it out.

2353
09:52:25,489 --> 09:52:29,680
What the fuck did I just get?

2354
09:52:29,680 --> 09:52:31,080
It was Santa Claus.

2355
09:52:31,080 --> 09:52:34,040
Stars are beautiful, weren't they?

2356
09:52:34,040 --> 09:52:45,540
Even if our star is what ultimately killed us.

2357
09:52:45,540 --> 09:52:54,989
I'll wait here, remember them while you gather everybody.

2358
09:52:54,989 --> 09:52:56,750
What are you guys looking at?

2359
09:52:56,750 --> 09:52:59,629
Okay, you're building a skeleton ladder.

2360
09:52:59,629 --> 09:53:21,519
What did you gather?

2361
09:53:21,519 --> 09:53:50,220
Mask, zoo.

2362
09:53:50,220 --> 09:54:52,150
Hypothesis, everyone must be here.

2363
09:54:52,150 --> 09:54:54,489
Once they arrive, I believe we'll be ready.

2364
09:54:54,489 --> 09:55:11,290
I'm gonna go to the other side of the ladder.

2365
09:55:11,290 --> 09:55:14,010
I'm gonna go to the other side of the ladder.

2366
09:55:14,250 --> 09:55:16,010
Once they arrive, I believe we'll be ready.

2367
09:55:16,010 --> 09:55:17,169
Glad you remembered me.

2368
09:55:19,510 --> 09:55:22,440
Collecting all my friends.

2369
09:55:22,440 --> 09:55:42,889
Quiet shade across old bark in the ancient glade.

2370
09:55:47,599 --> 09:56:11,250
It's always dark.

2371
09:56:11,250 --> 09:56:15,360
Okay, is that everybody?

2372
09:56:15,360 --> 09:56:19,839
That's everybody.

2373
09:56:19,839 --> 09:56:26,629
There ain't nobody else.

2374
09:56:26,629 --> 09:56:27,870
What do you say, time buddy?

2375
09:56:27,870 --> 09:56:29,879
Ready to start the music?

2376
09:56:29,879 --> 09:56:42,250
Yeah, this should be cool.

2377
09:56:42,250 --> 09:56:57,720
Get it going, play.

2378
09:56:57,720 --> 09:56:59,000
Conscious observers enter the eye.

2379
09:56:59,000 --> 09:57:00,559
I wonder what happens now.

2380
09:57:00,559 --> 09:57:01,400
Is it time to find out?

2381
09:57:01,480 --> 09:57:19,790
Not yet.

2382
09:57:19,790 --> 09:57:22,410
They all play together.

2383
09:57:22,410 --> 09:57:24,610
They've been playing the same songs in random places,

2384
09:57:24,610 --> 09:57:26,050
but it all matches up.

2385
09:57:29,260 --> 09:57:50,860
Into the fire.

2386
09:57:50,860 --> 09:57:57,519
Really burning.

2387
09:57:57,519 --> 09:57:58,919
Let's find out.

2388
09:57:58,919 --> 09:58:37,269
This song is new to me, but I'm honored to be a part of it.

2389
09:58:37,269 --> 09:58:40,279
You made a fucking party balloon.

2390
09:58:40,279 --> 09:58:41,879
I believe we've reached the end of our journey.

2391
09:58:41,879 --> 09:58:43,279
All that remains is to collapse

2392
09:58:43,279 --> 09:58:50,589
the innumerable possibilities before us.

2393
09:58:50,589 --> 09:59:05,199
Your curiosity friend, let's find out.

2394
09:59:05,199 --> 09:59:06,559
Cut a little close, don't you think?

2395
09:59:06,559 --> 09:59:08,279
Well, it worked out all right in the end, I suppose.

2396
09:59:08,519 --> 09:59:13,879
I hope there are beasties in the next one.

2397
09:59:13,879 --> 09:59:15,360
How long has it been since I got to make music

2398
09:59:15,360 --> 09:59:16,480
with everyone around Campfire?

2399
09:59:16,480 --> 09:59:20,680
I'm really happy we're all here.

2400
09:59:20,680 --> 09:59:22,199
Yet if it's over now, I had a good time learning,

2401
09:59:22,199 --> 09:59:25,120
but I think the rules are about to change.

2402
09:59:25,120 --> 09:59:26,959
I learned a lot by the end of everything.

2403
09:59:26,959 --> 09:59:29,879
Past is the past now, but that's okay.

2404
09:59:29,879 --> 09:59:31,599
It's never really gone completely.

2405
09:59:31,599 --> 09:59:32,839
Future is always built on the past,

2406
09:59:32,839 --> 09:59:35,279
even if we won't get to see it.

2407
09:59:35,279 --> 09:59:39,650
Still, it's time for something new.

2408
09:59:39,650 --> 09:59:40,809
Time for something new.

2409
10:00:16,529 --> 10:00:51,099
We're just going into the light, apparently.

2410
10:00:51,099 --> 10:00:57,730
Okay, so we went, we blew up,

2411
10:01:03,709 --> 10:01:10,569
restarted the universe, rebirthed the whole universe.

2412
10:01:20,959 --> 10:01:23,319
We just made a new, yeah, just make a new one.

2413
10:01:32,040 --> 10:01:34,919
That was pretty crazy ending sequence.

2414
10:01:34,919 --> 10:01:36,680
That was kind of all over the place.

2415
10:01:43,430 --> 10:01:49,650
That was really good.

2416
10:01:49,650 --> 10:01:50,889
You wanted to YouTube it.

2417
10:01:52,519 --> 10:01:57,580
No, I just didn't wanna fucking keep failing.

2418
10:02:00,400 --> 10:02:01,959
How would I have ever YouTubed that?

2419
10:02:01,959 --> 10:02:10,440
We would have watched somebody else stream the game.

2420
10:02:10,440 --> 10:02:12,000
What are your first impressions?

2421
10:02:16,440 --> 10:02:17,839
I love time travel.

2422
10:02:17,839 --> 10:02:20,599
That's a really cool concept.

2423
10:02:20,599 --> 10:02:21,480
I feel like this is one of those games

2424
10:02:21,480 --> 10:02:27,319
that I'm gonna wanna go read the Reddit or the Wikipedia

2425
10:02:27,319 --> 10:02:29,160
and just kind of reprocess everything

2426
10:02:29,160 --> 10:02:31,400
and have people tell me how cool everything is.

2427
10:02:43,500 --> 10:02:53,480
There's still things I didn't do, yeah.

2428
10:02:53,480 --> 10:02:56,120
I can see why people say this is one

2429
10:02:56,120 --> 10:02:57,319
of their favorite games last year.

2430
10:02:57,319 --> 10:02:58,599
I can understand it.

2431
10:02:59,599 --> 10:03:00,440
Makes sense.

2432
10:03:01,279 --> 10:03:15,230
Pretty unique.

2433
10:03:15,230 --> 10:03:19,809
No, I only got frustrated at like two parts.

2434
10:03:19,809 --> 10:03:23,970
The sand taking a long time was always,

2435
10:03:23,970 --> 10:03:35,139
no, that started frustrating me a little bit.

2436
10:03:35,139 --> 10:03:36,099
Hates the sand.

2437
10:03:37,410 --> 10:03:40,860
This was a college project.

2438
10:03:40,860 --> 10:03:43,260
Was this actually a college project?

2439
10:03:43,260 --> 10:03:44,860
Wait, what?

2440
10:03:44,860 --> 10:03:48,750
No, there's like 500 people on this game.

2441
10:03:48,750 --> 10:03:50,230
It's not a college.

2442
10:03:50,230 --> 10:03:54,470
I thought like, wait, did an entire college make this?

2443
10:03:59,550 --> 10:04:11,839
Every student apparently had something to do with it.

2444
10:04:11,839 --> 10:04:13,400
Started as a college project.

2445
10:04:18,199 --> 10:04:20,080
That was really, really cool.

2446
10:04:20,080 --> 10:04:23,620
I'm glad I experienced it.

2447
10:04:23,620 --> 10:04:27,230
You were so angry, you had a zit pop on its own.

2448
10:04:27,230 --> 10:04:28,870
Explain the story.

2449
10:04:28,870 --> 10:04:29,709
Sure.

2450
10:04:30,879 --> 10:04:33,559
There was this civilization of people

2451
10:04:33,559 --> 10:04:37,839
that wanted to find as much knowledge as they possibly could.

2452
10:04:38,760 --> 10:04:41,400
They came, well, while they were doing research

2453
10:04:41,400 --> 10:04:43,800
and they ended up on this galaxy,

2454
10:04:43,800 --> 10:04:47,480
they figured out that, uh-oh, this sun's going to explode.

2455
10:04:49,069 --> 10:04:51,269
This sun's gonna supernova and we're all dead.

2456
10:04:51,269 --> 10:04:52,269
We gotta find a way to try to,

2457
10:04:52,269 --> 10:04:54,269
we gotta make a way to stop it.

2458
10:04:54,269 --> 10:04:59,269
So they get together and they have a bunch of people

2459
10:04:59,269 --> 10:05:01,629
that are working on projects.

2460
10:05:01,629 --> 10:05:03,510
And then one of those people figures out,

2461
10:05:03,510 --> 10:05:05,949
dude, there's a comet here that's killing everybody.

2462
10:05:05,949 --> 10:05:07,589
And they all die from the comet.

2463
10:05:08,889 --> 10:05:14,319
And then you come in and you have to pick up the pieces

2464
10:05:14,839 --> 10:05:18,300
and solve the mystery that they left behind

2465
10:05:18,300 --> 10:05:41,319
as to why this super omega wrong.

2466
10:05:41,319 --> 10:05:44,730
Well, here's why this game's kind of hard to understand.

2467
10:05:44,730 --> 10:05:48,050
Because there's no one, two, three, four, or five

2468
10:05:48,050 --> 10:05:50,809
sequences or anything like that,

2469
10:05:50,809 --> 10:05:56,120
you can get this game's story like two, six, one, three, five.

2470
10:05:57,480 --> 10:06:27,919
So you can, wait, 14.3 billion years later.

2471
10:06:27,919 --> 10:06:29,760
I mean, you're also telling me to explain

2472
10:06:29,760 --> 10:06:32,239
an incredibly complicated, complex,

2473
10:06:32,239 --> 10:06:35,959
intertwining time travel story after 10 plus hours

2474
10:06:35,959 --> 10:06:48,760
sitting on a live stream talking to you guys.

2475
10:06:48,760 --> 10:06:50,360
I'm a little fried.

2476
10:06:50,360 --> 10:06:58,120
What was that that flew by?

2477
10:06:58,120 --> 10:07:00,040
That's you overshooting the planet.

2478
10:07:10,440 --> 10:07:12,199
That was the best joke of the whole night

2479
10:07:12,199 --> 10:07:16,800
and I had nothing to do with it.

2480
10:07:16,800 --> 10:07:18,000
All right, that's it.

2481
10:07:18,000 --> 10:07:19,959
Out of Wilds in the books in the bag.

2482
10:07:33,919 --> 10:07:36,900
All right, let's give it a letter grade.

2483
10:07:36,900 --> 10:07:44,720
Think here, this is gonna be tricky.

2484
10:07:44,720 --> 10:07:47,220
It's gonna be tricky.

2485
10:07:47,220 --> 10:07:48,620
I don't think this is an A plus.

2486
10:07:48,620 --> 10:07:58,819
Nope, I don't think so.

2487
10:07:58,819 --> 10:08:03,080
I'm not sure this is an A either.

2488
10:08:03,080 --> 10:08:10,419
I don't think this is a, I don't think this is a B.

2489
10:08:10,419 --> 10:08:15,300
A plus, I don't think so.

2490
10:08:15,300 --> 10:08:17,099
No, no, I'm not talking about going down.

2491
10:08:17,099 --> 10:08:19,220
Like, oh, I don't think there's just a C.

2492
10:08:19,220 --> 10:08:21,379
It's a C minus, no, no, no.

2493
10:08:21,379 --> 10:08:24,099
That's not, I'm saying I don't,

2494
10:08:24,099 --> 10:08:31,610
you're misconstruing what I'm saying.

2495
10:08:32,010 --> 10:08:34,639
I'm gonna give it a B plus.

2496
10:08:34,639 --> 10:08:39,290
I'm gonna give this an 89.

2497
10:08:39,290 --> 10:08:45,029
I'm gonna give this an 89.

2498
10:08:45,029 --> 10:09:02,099
Could've been a 90, could've been 89.

2499
10:09:02,099 --> 10:09:03,540
What would I dock points for?

2500
10:09:12,080 --> 10:09:13,199
You don't have to care what other things.

2501
10:09:13,199 --> 10:09:19,489
Give us your own score, 89.

2502
10:09:19,489 --> 10:09:20,849
What am I comparing it to?

2503
10:09:24,879 --> 10:09:28,519
I don't know.

2504
10:09:28,519 --> 10:09:31,120
Well, if you have a 10, you have a 10 point skill.

2505
10:09:31,120 --> 10:09:34,739
10 is the best game I've ever played in my life.

2506
10:09:34,739 --> 10:09:38,379
10 is the best thing you've ever done in your life.

2507
10:09:38,379 --> 10:09:48,639
A 10 out of 10.

2508
10:09:48,639 --> 10:09:50,559
Metacritic gave this an 85.

2509
10:09:50,559 --> 10:09:53,239
Yeah, but that's from a million different places.

2510
10:09:59,470 --> 10:10:01,669
89 out of 100 is,

2511
10:10:01,669 --> 10:10:03,910
I tell everybody I know that this was worth playing

2512
10:10:03,910 --> 10:10:06,699
and you should play it and it was great.

2513
10:10:06,699 --> 10:10:10,940
But for me, when you climb into like the 90s,

2514
10:10:10,940 --> 10:10:13,180
like 90, 91, 92, 93,

2515
10:10:14,669 --> 10:10:16,389
like for instance, last year,

2516
10:10:16,389 --> 10:10:17,709
this came out last year.

2517
10:10:17,709 --> 10:10:19,910
Resident Evil 2 for me was like a 95.

2518
10:10:20,589 --> 10:10:33,040
So an 89, that's very close.

2519
10:10:33,559 --> 10:10:48,250
Being my favorite game that came out last year.

2520
10:10:48,250 --> 10:10:50,010
Imagine being so dumb that you compare this

2521
10:10:50,010 --> 10:10:51,010
to Resident Evil 2.

2522
10:10:51,010 --> 10:10:51,849
What?

2523
10:10:51,849 --> 10:10:52,889
I didn't, wait, when did I say,

2524
10:10:52,889 --> 10:10:55,489
you know my favorite part is the zombies?

2525
10:10:55,489 --> 10:10:57,849
I said Resident Evil 2 was a 95 for me

2526
10:10:57,849 --> 10:10:59,809
and that was my favorite game of last year.

2527
10:10:59,809 --> 10:11:02,370
So a game that came out last year as well that's an 89

2528
10:11:02,370 --> 10:11:03,889
is pretty damn close to my favorite game

2529
10:11:03,889 --> 10:11:16,339
that came out last year is what I'm trying to say.

2530
10:11:16,339 --> 10:11:17,620
What's a 10 out of 10?

2531
10:11:17,620 --> 10:11:20,230
Team Fortress 2.

2532
10:11:20,910 --> 10:11:24,559
And this game was not as good as TF2.

2533
10:11:24,559 --> 10:11:28,080
Oh, fuck.

2534
10:11:28,080 --> 10:11:30,239
Okay, I can only be a dick for so long

2535
10:11:30,239 --> 10:11:33,199
before I have to fucking stop.

2536
10:11:33,199 --> 10:11:38,040
All right, so that was very, very good.

2537
10:11:38,040 --> 10:11:40,120
I am happy I played it.

2538
10:11:40,120 --> 10:11:41,519
It was a great recommendation.

2539
10:11:41,519 --> 10:11:42,360
I'm glad I played it.

2540
10:11:42,360 --> 10:11:54,489
It was very good.

2541
10:11:54,489 --> 10:11:57,040
Where's Bloodborne on that scale?

2542
10:11:57,040 --> 10:11:58,790
98.

2543
10:11:58,790 --> 10:12:00,430
Bloodborne is in 98.

2544
10:12:00,430 --> 10:12:02,110
It's only two basis points,

2545
10:12:02,110 --> 10:12:05,290
two points are taken off because it's 30 FPS.

2546
10:12:05,290 --> 10:12:13,410
If that game is 60 FPS, it's 100.

2547
10:12:13,410 --> 10:12:14,970
All right, we're gonna be doing Tony Hawk tomorrow,

2548
10:12:14,970 --> 10:12:17,919
Tony Hawk Underground.

2549
10:12:17,919 --> 10:12:20,339
Should be a lot of fun.

2550
10:12:20,339 --> 10:12:21,540
That was Outer Wilds.

2551
10:12:21,540 --> 10:12:24,379
It was a very, very nice game.

2552
10:12:24,379 --> 10:12:26,379
So good in fact that it was an 89.

2553
10:12:26,379 --> 10:12:28,779
It was a B plus slash A minus.

2554
10:12:30,169 --> 10:12:42,400
That means it was very fucking good.

2555
10:12:42,400 --> 10:12:44,360
Don't even try it, Jeremy.

2556
10:12:44,360 --> 10:12:45,680
You can't do that.

2557
10:12:51,220 --> 10:12:53,540
What would you give Simpsons hit and run?

2558
10:12:53,540 --> 10:12:54,900
Oh, that's easy.

2559
10:12:54,900 --> 10:13:02,790
Probably a four or five.

2560
10:13:02,790 --> 10:13:12,610
Somewhere like a 4.8 out of 100.

2561
10:13:12,610 --> 10:13:13,449
No, out of 10.

2562
10:13:14,730 --> 10:13:18,150
No, 48 out of 100.

2563
10:13:25,169 --> 10:13:26,769
Ooh, the vibrations.

2564
10:13:28,739 --> 10:13:31,400
You guys are killing me.

2565
10:13:31,400 --> 10:13:33,680
What would I give Jump King?

2566
10:13:33,680 --> 10:13:37,190
I don't think you can even rate Jump King.

2567
10:13:37,190 --> 10:13:39,989
Jump King is like going and riding a ride at Disneyland.

2568
10:13:39,989 --> 10:13:41,029
You know what I mean?

2569
10:13:41,029 --> 10:13:49,279
It's not like I feel like I can't even rate that game.

2570
10:13:49,279 --> 10:13:51,000
Like you ride a ride at Disney and you're like,

2571
10:13:51,000 --> 10:13:52,680
oh, I've rid that ride.

2572
10:13:52,959 --> 10:13:57,069
I guess cool.

2573
10:13:57,069 --> 10:13:58,750
I can't score that game.

2574
10:13:58,750 --> 10:14:00,870
You just jump into walls and scream.

2575
10:14:00,870 --> 10:14:07,849
Like I can't even score it.

2576
10:14:07,849 --> 10:14:09,250
That was an experience.

2577
10:14:09,250 --> 10:14:11,650
It wasn't really a video game that I'm going to play.

2578
10:14:11,650 --> 10:14:17,040
I experienced that game.

2579
10:14:17,040 --> 10:14:18,800
I wouldn't even call it a video game.

2580
10:14:18,800 --> 10:14:20,440
I would call it just like a simulation

2581
10:14:20,440 --> 10:14:22,000
for your brain to get angry.

2582
10:14:22,000 --> 10:14:24,120
It's not even a game.

2583
10:14:24,120 --> 10:14:25,199
What would I give Mario Tennis?

2584
10:14:25,199 --> 10:14:43,660
A six.

2585
10:14:43,660 --> 10:14:51,500
What do I give Cuphead?

2586
10:14:51,500 --> 10:15:05,639
87, too short.

2587
10:15:05,639 --> 10:15:11,959
Kana zero.

2588
10:15:11,959 --> 10:15:21,839
70, 80, no.

2589
10:15:21,839 --> 10:15:26,800
79, too short.

2590
10:15:26,800 --> 10:15:33,959
Any more?

2591
10:15:33,959 --> 10:15:36,209
No more heroes.

2592
10:15:36,209 --> 10:15:45,599
No more heroes on Wii or no more heroes the way I played it.

2593
10:15:45,599 --> 10:15:47,519
The way I played it on both.

2594
10:15:47,519 --> 10:15:52,919
A Wii, it's like a seven one or like a six eight

2595
10:15:52,919 --> 10:15:56,459
because the game runs like shit.

2596
10:15:56,459 --> 10:16:01,459
It's like a solid like 78 or like 79 the way that I played it.

2597
10:16:06,870 --> 10:16:07,910
I would give it, I would give it up now.

2598
10:16:07,910 --> 10:16:08,870
No, it deserves an 80.

2599
10:16:08,870 --> 10:16:09,709
It does.

2600
10:16:09,709 --> 10:16:13,889
It deserves like an 80s flat, just like a B minus.

2601
10:16:13,889 --> 10:16:16,800
Nancy Drew.

2602
10:16:16,800 --> 10:16:17,639
All right, we're done.

2603
10:16:17,639 --> 10:16:18,480
We're not doing this anymore.

2604
10:16:18,480 --> 10:16:21,110
I'm going, I'm going to leave.

2605
10:16:21,110 --> 10:16:29,360
But if I had to give Nancy Drew a score, 95, 94?

2606
10:16:29,360 --> 10:16:31,769
Yeah, 94.

2607
10:16:31,769 --> 10:16:33,750
And then, okay, good night.

2608
10:16:33,750 --> 10:16:36,589
All the Drew crew, good night.

2609
10:16:36,589 --> 10:16:42,629
We'll see you later.

2610
10:16:42,629 --> 10:16:44,430
Okay, now that they probably clicked the X

2611
10:16:44,430 --> 10:16:46,550
because a lot of them just definitely were leaving.

2612
10:16:46,550 --> 10:16:48,110
It's like a six.

2613
10:16:48,110 --> 10:17:04,720
No, it's like a four and a half.

2614
10:17:04,720 --> 10:17:06,639
We got to keep the Drew crew going though.

2615
10:17:06,639 --> 10:17:08,360
We can't just tell them that there's the game

2616
10:17:08,360 --> 10:17:13,610
that they love is a six.

2617
10:17:13,610 --> 10:17:17,139
Although, yes, you can.

2618
10:17:18,099 --> 10:17:20,139
Yes, you can, Jeremy.

2619
10:17:21,279 --> 10:17:22,800
I do it all the time.

2620
10:17:27,550 --> 10:17:29,519
Rating stuff.

2621
10:17:29,519 --> 10:17:33,040
I give it a nine.

2622
10:17:33,040 --> 10:17:34,720
All right, let's do the bits.

2623
10:17:34,720 --> 10:17:38,029
See you tomorrow for Tony Hawk if you're leaving.

2624
10:17:38,029 --> 10:17:42,110
Let's get through this.

2625
10:17:42,110 --> 10:17:44,430
Bob Boy, thanks for the 1500 bits.

2626
10:17:44,430 --> 10:17:45,269
Thank you, Bob Boy.

2627
10:17:45,269 --> 10:17:48,309
Half-Life series free until the release of Half-Life Alex.

2628
10:17:48,309 --> 10:17:50,750
And you claim to play Half-Life Alex the day it comes out.

2629
10:17:50,750 --> 10:17:52,669
Plus the developers of Half-Life Alex

2630
10:17:52,669 --> 10:17:54,750
recommending you play Half-Life series

2631
10:17:54,750 --> 10:17:55,629
to get a grip on the story.

2632
10:17:55,629 --> 10:17:56,949
Will you play the Half-Life series?

2633
10:17:56,949 --> 10:18:04,199
I've played Half-Life one already.

2634
10:18:04,199 --> 10:18:05,120
I've played Half-Life two.

2635
10:18:05,120 --> 10:18:08,319
I know the story.

2636
10:18:08,319 --> 10:18:20,550
I already know this stuff.

2637
10:18:20,550 --> 10:18:23,709
Tell us the story.

2638
10:18:23,709 --> 10:18:26,470
No, I'm not gonna rifle off all the story beats

2639
10:18:26,470 --> 10:18:27,669
for Half-Life one and two.

2640
10:18:27,669 --> 10:18:36,330
Somebody might not have played it yet.

2641
10:18:36,330 --> 10:18:37,919
Doesn't know.

2642
10:18:37,959 --> 10:18:40,519
You're a scientist and you push a crystal into,

2643
10:18:40,519 --> 10:18:44,199
you're working on a project.

2644
10:18:44,199 --> 10:18:46,400
You're a scientist working on a project

2645
10:18:46,400 --> 10:18:50,199
and you're trying to reach to find out as much as you can

2646
10:18:50,199 --> 10:18:51,919
because you're curious.

2647
10:18:51,919 --> 10:18:56,069
And something about the sun is gonna explode.

2648
10:18:56,069 --> 10:18:57,550
The sun is gonna explode.

2649
10:18:57,550 --> 10:19:00,839
In Half-Life, that's what they know for certain.

2650
10:19:00,839 --> 10:19:03,040
So Gordon and a few others get together

2651
10:19:03,040 --> 10:19:03,879
and they try to figure out a way

2652
10:19:03,879 --> 10:19:09,550
to make the supernova not happen.

2653
10:19:09,550 --> 10:19:11,529
They end up dying.

2654
10:19:11,529 --> 10:19:15,569
And then you play as the gameplay character

2655
10:19:15,569 --> 10:19:18,160
who they named the G-Man.

2656
10:19:18,160 --> 10:19:19,680
You walk around, you get a stick,

2657
10:19:19,680 --> 10:19:21,279
you get a red crowbar.

2658
10:19:21,279 --> 10:19:28,800
It's a great, it's a really great game.

2659
10:19:28,800 --> 10:19:29,680
And then there are these bugs

2660
10:19:29,680 --> 10:19:32,319
that fucking drink your brain and shit.

2661
10:19:32,319 --> 10:19:34,279
I know what they are.

2662
10:19:34,279 --> 10:19:35,120
They called, what are they called?

2663
10:19:35,120 --> 10:19:39,339
The ambassadors or something.

2664
10:19:39,339 --> 10:19:54,980
They, I know what I'm talking about.

2665
10:19:54,980 --> 10:20:00,309
What a great story.

2666
10:20:00,309 --> 10:20:02,989
Dude, just like, just explain the story to me.

2667
10:20:02,989 --> 10:20:05,150
All right, let's keep going.

2668
10:20:05,150 --> 10:20:06,830
No, I'm not gonna play Half-Life on stream.

2669
10:20:06,830 --> 10:20:07,669
I'm not gonna do it.

2670
10:20:07,669 --> 10:20:08,510
I'm not gonna do it.

2671
10:20:08,510 --> 10:20:09,349
I'm not gonna do it.

2672
10:20:09,349 --> 10:20:10,389
LMMan, thanks for the thousand bits.

2673
10:20:10,389 --> 10:20:17,099
Dermot, you are the son of sons.

2674
10:20:17,099 --> 10:20:17,940
Thank you.

2675
10:20:17,940 --> 10:20:19,720
Thanks for the thousand bits.

2676
10:20:19,720 --> 10:20:21,800
LMMan again, Dermot, you're the best.

2677
10:20:21,800 --> 10:20:22,959
You're the only streamer I donate to.

2678
10:20:22,959 --> 10:20:24,360
I hope these bits will feed your rats.

2679
10:20:24,360 --> 10:20:28,459
Thanks for the 500 bits and the thousand bits.

2680
10:20:28,459 --> 10:20:33,089
I will feed my rats that I eventually might own.

2681
10:20:33,089 --> 10:20:33,930
Thank you though.

2682
10:20:33,930 --> 10:20:35,129
Thank you SuperBruce for the five community subs

2683
10:20:35,129 --> 10:20:36,970
fitting 300 bits.

2684
10:20:36,970 --> 10:20:38,449
I just remembered you said you were gonna rename

2685
10:20:38,449 --> 10:20:41,010
phylactery lich to phylactery 50.

2686
10:20:41,010 --> 10:20:48,610
How the fuck did you not think of phylactery rich?

2687
10:20:48,610 --> 10:20:51,120
That's pretty good too.

2688
10:20:51,120 --> 10:20:56,089
That's also pretty good too.

2689
10:20:56,089 --> 10:20:59,480
Attack of the Hank, thanks for five subs.

2690
10:20:59,480 --> 10:21:03,440
Daddy Umbra gave 350 plus dollars tonight in bits.

2691
10:21:03,440 --> 10:21:04,519
35,000 bits.

2692
10:21:04,519 --> 10:21:05,360
Thank you, Daddy Umbra.

2693
10:21:05,360 --> 10:21:09,980
Ridiculous, insane amounts of money.

2694
10:21:09,980 --> 10:21:11,220
Kazzy, five community subs.

2695
10:21:11,220 --> 10:21:14,529
Thank you, Kazzy.

2696
10:21:14,529 --> 10:21:15,809
Taylix, thanks for the 500 bits.

2697
10:21:15,809 --> 10:21:17,129
I dropped out of college a few months ago

2698
10:21:17,129 --> 10:21:18,330
and I feel like shit.

2699
10:21:18,330 --> 10:21:20,449
Can I get some words of encouragement?

2700
10:21:20,449 --> 10:21:22,730
He is the founder of this game's development team.

2701
10:21:23,489 --> 10:21:27,089
Masioka was an actor for the TV show Heroes.

2702
10:21:27,089 --> 10:21:32,099
It's fucking awesome.

2703
10:21:32,099 --> 10:21:38,279
Well, the only thing I can really say to you is

2704
10:21:38,279 --> 10:21:41,209
college is not for everybody.

2705
10:21:41,209 --> 10:21:44,839
And hopefully, it seems that you may have

2706
10:21:44,839 --> 10:21:46,760
figured out that already.

2707
10:21:46,760 --> 10:21:51,959
But you don't necessarily have to.

2708
10:21:51,959 --> 10:21:54,029
You don't have to do that.

2709
10:21:54,029 --> 10:21:55,430
And I know a lot of people think that college

2710
10:21:55,430 --> 10:21:56,989
is kind of like the end of the world,

2711
10:21:56,989 --> 10:21:59,750
like the end all be all, like you have to do this.

2712
10:21:59,750 --> 10:22:01,349
But there's a lot of different things you can try.

2713
10:22:01,349 --> 10:22:02,949
You can do trades.

2714
10:22:02,949 --> 10:22:03,790
You can...

2715
10:22:05,709 --> 10:22:08,470
I know like some people study foreign languages

2716
10:22:08,470 --> 10:22:10,589
and they teach, they teach English.

2717
10:22:10,589 --> 10:22:15,110
You can do that.

2718
10:22:15,110 --> 10:22:19,080
Trades pay a lot of fucking money.

2719
10:22:19,080 --> 10:22:20,440
They really do.

2720
10:22:20,440 --> 10:22:22,480
Some of my closest friends in my whole life

2721
10:22:22,480 --> 10:22:23,940
are in the trades.

2722
10:22:23,940 --> 10:22:33,139
And they do really, really, really fucking well.

2723
10:22:33,139 --> 10:22:35,019
So I really hope you don't think that

2724
10:22:35,019 --> 10:22:37,860
potentially being out of college is

2725
10:22:38,540 --> 10:22:42,900
something that should be a huge, huge, huge problem.

2726
10:22:42,900 --> 10:22:43,860
It's just not for everybody.

2727
10:22:43,860 --> 10:22:58,389
It just isn't.

2728
10:22:58,389 --> 10:22:59,790
Go to streamer school.

2729
10:23:00,830 --> 10:23:07,029
Well, that's not real.

2730
10:23:07,029 --> 10:23:10,510
Yeah, it's about finding something that works for you.

2731
10:23:10,510 --> 10:23:13,110
Find something that works for you.

2732
10:23:13,110 --> 10:23:15,309
You might not need to go to school for it.

2733
10:23:15,309 --> 10:23:19,690
Well, I mean, a typical four year college.

2734
10:23:19,690 --> 10:23:21,209
So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

2735
10:23:21,209 --> 10:23:25,000
Plus, you can always try again later.

2736
10:23:25,000 --> 10:23:27,120
If you really want to study something in college,

2737
10:23:27,120 --> 10:23:30,519
you can try it again another time.

2738
10:23:30,519 --> 10:23:33,040
I don't know how old you are, but if you're still young,

2739
10:23:33,040 --> 10:23:34,040
some people, it doesn't matter.

2740
10:23:34,040 --> 10:23:36,839
Some people go to college in their 30s.

2741
10:23:36,839 --> 10:23:38,279
And that's fine.

2742
10:23:38,279 --> 10:23:46,239
That's all right.

2743
10:23:46,239 --> 10:23:49,680
I wish you the best though.

2744
10:23:49,680 --> 10:23:52,870
Thanks for the 500 bits.

2745
10:23:52,870 --> 10:23:54,230
If you're a raw host, thanks for the 500 bits.

2746
10:23:54,230 --> 10:23:55,669
Hey German, I just want to thank you for being there for me.

2747
10:23:55,669 --> 10:23:58,989
I've been watching you for over seven years now.

2748
10:23:58,989 --> 10:24:01,069
Since then I finished two schools,

2749
10:24:01,069 --> 10:24:05,120
got through a lot of stuff and with all your help.

2750
10:24:05,120 --> 10:24:07,519
Right now I'm being challenged more than ever.

2751
10:24:07,559 --> 10:24:10,199
So here I am seeking happiness with you.

2752
10:24:10,199 --> 10:24:14,379
Thank you for everything you have done for me over the years.

2753
10:24:14,379 --> 10:24:18,169
It's a very long time to be watching this channel.

2754
10:24:18,169 --> 10:24:20,809
I sometimes I assume people will watch it

2755
10:24:20,809 --> 10:24:23,169
and kind of get bored after a few months or like a year

2756
10:24:23,169 --> 10:24:25,529
and then be like, all right, that was cool for a while.

2757
10:24:25,529 --> 10:24:26,569
But some of you guys have stuck around

2758
10:24:26,569 --> 10:24:29,169
for a insanely long time,

2759
10:24:29,169 --> 10:24:32,610
almost 10 years for a lot of you guys.

2760
10:24:32,610 --> 10:24:33,849
And that's crazy.

2761
10:24:33,849 --> 10:24:35,690
I'm shocked, I'm happy.

2762
10:24:35,690 --> 10:24:39,610
And I can't even tell you how I'm glad you still think

2763
10:24:39,769 --> 10:24:46,599
this is a fun place to still be.

2764
10:24:46,599 --> 10:24:48,120
And any of your challenges going on right now,

2765
10:24:48,120 --> 10:24:53,279
Veraus, I hope you get through them.

2766
10:24:53,279 --> 10:25:00,160
Take it slow, stay focused, and do you.

2767
10:25:00,160 --> 10:25:01,120
Help, I'm stuck here.

2768
10:25:01,120 --> 10:25:06,180
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

2769
10:25:06,180 --> 10:25:10,419
Unmod, demod, purge, ban, remove founder.

2770
10:25:19,470 --> 10:25:21,809
Can I be a mod?

2771
10:25:21,809 --> 10:25:23,370
Nah, sorry.

2772
10:25:25,760 --> 10:25:28,040
We also had Squishington, thanks for the 300 bits.

2773
10:25:28,040 --> 10:25:29,680
Love you, German, thanks for always making my day better.

2774
10:25:29,680 --> 10:25:30,720
Thanks for making my day better

2775
10:25:30,720 --> 10:25:33,319
because you hanging out here allows me

2776
10:25:33,319 --> 10:25:35,239
to continue to do this and allows me

2777
10:25:35,239 --> 10:25:38,400
to make enough monetary compensation

2778
10:25:38,400 --> 10:25:42,800
to do something like this for a living, which is ridiculous.

2779
10:25:42,800 --> 10:25:47,589
So thank you for sitting here and watching this

2780
10:25:47,589 --> 10:25:55,559
because you're making my day better, immensely.

2781
10:25:55,559 --> 10:25:57,319
He's in it for the fucking money.

2782
10:25:59,599 --> 10:26:00,440
That's true.

2783
10:26:01,480 --> 10:26:07,379
Without people watching, without people here,

2784
10:26:07,379 --> 10:26:09,339
and I don't know, I don't, who knows how long

2785
10:26:09,339 --> 10:26:13,870
I would have been able to do it.

2786
10:26:13,870 --> 10:26:16,389
Remember, I'm starting to get a little older

2787
10:26:16,389 --> 10:26:18,230
and I'm not so sure, you know,

2788
10:26:18,230 --> 10:26:22,279
let's say rewind the clock 10 years.

2789
10:26:22,279 --> 10:26:25,000
If my YouTube channel didn't really start gaining viewership

2790
10:26:25,000 --> 10:26:28,360
when it did, I'm not sure I would have spent

2791
10:26:28,360 --> 10:26:31,769
too much more time on it.

2792
10:26:31,769 --> 10:26:33,089
Maybe after like a couple of years,

2793
10:26:33,089 --> 10:26:34,730
like two or three, four years, maybe it'd be like,

2794
10:26:34,730 --> 10:26:36,849
all right, I'm getting, I'm starting to be,

2795
10:26:36,849 --> 10:26:40,190
I'm gonna be 30, so I'm gonna try to figure something out.

2796
10:26:40,190 --> 10:26:41,029
You know what I'm saying?

2797
10:26:41,029 --> 10:26:42,190
So people being here, people watching,

2798
10:26:42,230 --> 10:26:45,949
and the views and the subscriptions on YouTube, I mean,

2799
10:26:45,949 --> 10:26:49,489
and into Twitch, that's,

2800
10:26:49,489 --> 10:26:51,889
you've allowed me to continue to do this.

2801
10:26:51,889 --> 10:26:59,010
You've allowed me to make fun what I do for work.

2802
10:26:59,010 --> 10:26:59,889
You know what I mean?

2803
10:26:59,889 --> 10:27:02,610
Trying to just have as much fun as I can

2804
10:27:02,610 --> 10:27:05,089
with as many people as possible.

2805
10:27:05,089 --> 10:27:09,769
You've done, that's what you have done.

2806
10:27:09,769 --> 10:27:27,879
Don't ever forget that.

2807
10:27:27,879 --> 10:27:30,639
It's like I said, the closer that I was moving

2808
10:27:30,639 --> 10:27:32,879
into like my early 30s, it's, you know,

2809
10:27:32,919 --> 10:27:36,120
I'm like, all right, what do I wanna do now?

2810
10:27:36,120 --> 10:27:37,919
And that still might happen.

2811
10:27:37,919 --> 10:27:39,040
I don't have a crystal ball.

2812
10:27:39,040 --> 10:27:44,389
I don't know how long Twitch and being

2813
10:27:44,430 --> 10:27:48,250
an online content creator or in quotes,

2814
10:27:48,250 --> 10:27:52,410
an online entertainment influencer in any quote.

2815
10:27:52,410 --> 10:27:53,250
I don't know.

2816
10:27:53,250 --> 10:27:54,730
I don't know what the future holds.

2817
10:27:54,730 --> 10:27:57,290
So I'm trying to keep an open mind about it

2818
10:27:57,290 --> 10:28:02,870
and just kind of go with the flow and see what happens.

2819
10:28:02,910 --> 10:28:07,370
Somebody was saying, hey, about the college thing.

2820
10:28:07,370 --> 10:28:10,150
Like Taylix said about the college thing.

2821
10:28:10,150 --> 10:28:12,949
I mean, I might be in my early 40s and be like,

2822
10:28:12,949 --> 10:28:17,650
all right, now what am I doing now?

2823
10:28:17,650 --> 10:28:21,519
You got plenty of time.

2824
10:28:21,519 --> 10:28:26,860
Produces, I screwed up your name again.

2825
10:28:26,860 --> 10:28:30,089
And I'm probably gonna get corrected for it.

2826
10:28:30,089 --> 10:28:33,410
But it was Produces Asen and I know it's wrong.

2827
10:28:33,410 --> 10:28:34,569
I already know it's wrong.

2828
10:28:34,569 --> 10:28:39,620
Thanks for the six community subs a little earlier.

2829
10:28:39,620 --> 10:28:43,620
Hawkwing, thanks for 500 bits, Producesen, there it is.

2830
10:28:46,129 --> 10:28:47,449
Thank you Hawkwing for the 500 bits.

2831
10:28:47,449 --> 10:28:48,529
Jerma, why do you hate this game?

2832
10:28:48,529 --> 10:28:49,889
It makes me sad, it's my favorite game.

2833
10:28:49,889 --> 10:28:50,730
Why do you hate me?

2834
10:28:50,730 --> 10:28:53,559
What?

2835
10:28:53,559 --> 10:28:54,639
Jerma, why do you hate this game?

2836
10:28:54,639 --> 10:28:56,080
It makes me sad, it's my favorite game.

2837
10:28:56,080 --> 10:29:00,089
Why do you hate me?

2838
10:29:00,089 --> 10:29:04,110
When did I say I hate this game?

2839
10:29:04,110 --> 10:29:16,919
I just gave it an 89.

2840
10:29:16,919 --> 10:29:18,720
That's a hater grade.

2841
10:29:18,720 --> 10:29:20,120
Wait, hold on.

2842
10:29:20,120 --> 10:29:23,199
Am I under the assumption that any game that's under a 90

2843
10:29:23,199 --> 10:29:24,959
is a game that the person hated?

2844
10:29:28,519 --> 10:29:34,040
Isn't that reserved for a three?

2845
10:29:34,040 --> 10:29:37,620
I would give The Surge a three.

2846
10:29:37,620 --> 10:29:43,480
I would give, I mean, that's,

2847
10:29:43,480 --> 10:29:57,309
so you're talking about going from a three to an 8.9.

2848
10:29:57,309 --> 10:29:59,269
Giving The Surge a three is generous.

2849
10:30:09,040 --> 10:30:10,519
Future Gamer, thanks for the 250.

2850
10:30:10,519 --> 10:30:12,599
Will you also be doing the Get Well Soon card

2851
10:30:12,599 --> 10:30:14,160
during the Diablo stream?

2852
10:30:14,160 --> 10:30:18,400
I talked about it earlier, yesterday I think,

2853
10:30:18,400 --> 10:30:19,480
and in the pre-stream chat as well,

2854
10:30:19,480 --> 10:30:23,180
but I'm gonna do the card alone.

2855
10:30:23,180 --> 10:30:24,819
I'd rather experience that by myself.

2856
10:30:24,819 --> 10:30:33,019
I feel like that's more appropriate for me.

2857
10:30:33,059 --> 10:30:40,610
It lets me sit there and take it in by myself.

2858
10:30:40,610 --> 10:30:45,199
So I will not be doing it on stream.

2859
10:30:45,199 --> 10:30:46,239
Almost midnight Pacific.

2860
10:30:46,239 --> 10:30:47,199
Yeah, I mean, this is a long one.

2861
10:30:47,199 --> 10:30:49,870
I knew I wanted to get it done tonight.

2862
10:30:49,870 --> 10:30:56,739
We'll be back tomorrow afternoon, Tony Hawk.

2863
10:30:56,739 --> 10:30:58,019
Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.

2864
10:30:58,019 --> 10:31:01,059
Any anticipated VR stuff or is that still off the table?

2865
10:31:01,059 --> 10:31:04,540
I also now get why you only did four to five hour streams

2866
10:31:04,540 --> 10:31:07,019
because boy, does this motion sickness just lie inside you

2867
10:31:07,019 --> 10:31:08,199
and come on instantly.

2868
10:31:09,849 --> 10:31:14,300
Yeah, being in that VR headset

2869
10:31:14,300 --> 10:31:23,180
and broadcasting is, it just, it takes a lot out of you.

2870
10:31:23,540 --> 10:31:25,550
Any VR stuff?

2871
10:31:25,550 --> 10:31:27,639
Kinda, yeah.

2872
10:31:27,639 --> 10:31:32,879
Besides Half-Life Alex, obviously.

2873
10:31:32,879 --> 10:31:34,559
It's not that Walking Dead game came out.

2874
10:31:34,559 --> 10:31:35,599
It kinda looks cool.

2875
10:31:37,480 --> 10:31:39,319
Boneworks looks awesome.

2876
10:31:39,319 --> 10:31:44,459
I really wanna play it.

2877
10:31:44,459 --> 10:31:45,940
There's at least two or three titles that I know

2878
10:31:45,940 --> 10:31:50,250
that I wanna play.

2879
10:31:50,250 --> 10:31:52,809
Tarisov, thanks for the 400 bits.

2880
10:31:52,809 --> 10:31:56,190
Appreciate it.

2881
10:31:56,190 --> 10:31:59,220
Let's get the credits rolling.

2882
10:31:59,220 --> 10:32:04,819
We're nearing the end here.

2883
10:32:04,819 --> 10:32:15,870
We'll bump you, just make sure.

2884
10:32:15,870 --> 10:32:25,260
We hand that guy.

2885
10:32:25,260 --> 10:32:26,779
Hold on, let me just get it on the screen.

2886
10:32:26,779 --> 10:32:27,779
It should be there.

2887
10:32:29,260 --> 10:32:31,779
In three, two, one.

2888
10:32:35,010 --> 10:32:36,730
There it is.

2889
10:32:36,730 --> 10:32:39,309
Thanks to all the subs.

2890
10:32:39,309 --> 10:32:47,220
The oil that continues to move the machine.

2891
10:32:47,220 --> 10:32:49,620
Appreciate it.

2892
10:32:49,620 --> 10:32:52,680
Thank you guys for letting me do what I do.

2893
10:32:56,580 --> 10:32:59,739
I know maybe not every stream is your favorite.

2894
10:32:59,739 --> 10:33:04,559
Maybe not every stream is my favorite, right?

2895
10:33:04,559 --> 10:33:06,160
Some streams are my favorite thing in the world.

2896
10:33:06,160 --> 10:33:08,980
Some streams are your favorite things in the world.

2897
10:33:08,980 --> 10:33:14,040
But at the end of the day, thanks for letting me do this.

2898
10:33:14,040 --> 10:33:15,239
No, not this one.

2899
10:33:15,239 --> 10:33:16,160
Not this one.

2900
10:33:16,160 --> 10:33:17,319
This was fun.

2901
10:33:17,319 --> 10:33:18,319
These last two streams,

2902
10:33:18,319 --> 10:33:21,199
I've had a lot of fun playing this fucking game.

2903
10:33:21,199 --> 10:33:22,919
I'm just saying in general.

2904
10:33:22,919 --> 10:33:23,760
In general.

2905
10:33:28,500 --> 10:33:30,760
We have a game in 89.

2906
10:33:30,760 --> 10:33:40,819
But all of a sudden, he's talking about Asura's wrath.

2907
10:33:44,699 --> 10:33:48,190
God damn it.

2908
10:33:48,190 --> 10:33:49,589
All right, let me be real with you.

2909
10:33:49,589 --> 10:33:51,150
This is the end of the stream.

2910
10:33:51,150 --> 10:33:52,750
Half the audience is gone.

2911
10:33:52,750 --> 10:33:54,430
Let me just be real with you guys.

2912
10:33:54,430 --> 10:33:56,309
People fucking did not like that game.

2913
10:33:57,349 --> 10:33:59,269
Can we be completely real here?

2914
10:33:59,269 --> 10:34:02,690
People were not happy that I was playing that game.

2915
10:34:02,690 --> 10:34:13,569
People were like, like losing their minds.

2916
10:34:13,569 --> 10:34:17,830
But we're probably gonna finish it.

2917
10:34:17,830 --> 10:34:32,220
If this time after Diablo II, I'm gonna try to play it.

2918
10:34:32,220 --> 10:34:35,180
So again, you know, some of your streams

2919
10:34:35,180 --> 10:34:38,180
might not be your favorite streams or your favorite games.

2920
10:34:38,180 --> 10:34:40,220
But thanks for continuing to come back

2921
10:34:40,220 --> 10:34:42,180
and continuing to talk and continuing to hang out

2922
10:34:42,180 --> 10:34:44,930
and still having fun as I am.

2923
10:34:47,830 --> 10:34:50,629
We had a box box raid earlier for a shitload of people.

2924
10:34:50,629 --> 10:34:51,709
I don't know if you're still here.

2925
10:34:51,709 --> 10:34:54,819
Some of you guys might still be here.

2926
10:34:54,819 --> 10:34:57,349
Thanks box box.

2927
10:34:57,349 --> 10:34:58,269
You're awesome.

2928
10:34:58,269 --> 10:35:04,029
Thank you.

2929
10:35:04,029 --> 10:35:06,580
Really appreciate that.

2930
10:35:06,580 --> 10:35:10,089
Big Applewood, 500 bits.

2931
10:35:10,089 --> 10:35:12,389
No message.

2932
10:35:12,389 --> 10:35:15,150
A Skedongler gave a thousand bits, $10.

2933
10:35:15,150 --> 10:35:16,709
Today we were all told to write down the name

2934
10:35:16,709 --> 10:35:18,389
of someone who we look up to

2935
10:35:18,389 --> 10:35:20,830
and put it up on the board at my school.

2936
10:35:20,830 --> 10:35:22,069
I racked my brain for a while

2937
10:35:22,069 --> 10:35:24,550
and you always ended up on the top of my list.

2938
10:35:24,589 --> 10:35:26,790
We were then told to find a way to thank that person.

2939
10:35:26,790 --> 10:35:28,430
So here I am.

2940
10:35:28,430 --> 10:35:31,949
I honestly think you're the most selfless human being.

2941
10:35:31,949 --> 10:35:33,910
I want to grow up to be as humble and kind as you.

2942
10:35:33,910 --> 10:35:35,150
You're such an inspiring dude.

2943
10:35:35,150 --> 10:35:36,660
Hope you know.

2944
10:35:36,660 --> 10:35:38,540
Love you, Jare Bear.

2945
10:35:38,540 --> 10:35:45,300
We tease you because we love you.

2946
10:35:45,300 --> 10:35:47,500
That's something I never thought I would ever hear

2947
10:35:47,500 --> 10:35:53,110
anybody say when I was, you know, like 16.

2948
10:35:53,110 --> 10:35:57,559
Knowing that that happened is just,

2949
10:35:57,559 --> 10:36:00,279
I hope you being influenced positively.

2950
10:36:00,279 --> 10:36:06,809
Regardless of talking shit, fucking around, making jokes.

2951
10:36:06,809 --> 10:36:10,660
However you view these streams,

2952
10:36:10,660 --> 10:36:13,699
I really hope that you take something good from here.

2953
10:36:13,699 --> 10:36:17,459
Something.

2954
10:36:17,459 --> 10:36:20,099
And not everything has to be super duper positive

2955
10:36:20,099 --> 10:36:22,940
and perfect and fantastic and oh my God, it's so good.

2956
10:36:22,940 --> 10:36:25,190
Everything's perfect, everything's positive.

2957
10:36:25,190 --> 10:36:26,029
But at the end of the day,

2958
10:36:26,029 --> 10:36:27,750
I really hope you look back on this and you go like,

2959
10:36:27,750 --> 10:36:30,389
oh, that was like actually a really kind of fun time.

2960
10:36:33,470 --> 10:36:35,389
I met some people, met some friends.

2961
10:36:35,389 --> 10:36:36,510
It was a place to hang out.

2962
10:36:36,510 --> 10:36:40,870
It was something to watch, something to think was fun, right?

2963
10:36:40,870 --> 10:36:44,209
Like I hope at the end of the day, you do think that.

2964
10:36:44,209 --> 10:36:45,849
I never want to be somebody you look back on

2965
10:36:45,849 --> 10:36:48,250
and be like, yeah, that sucked.

2966
10:36:48,250 --> 10:36:49,250
That guy sucks.

2967
10:36:49,250 --> 10:36:51,910
That community was dumb.

2968
10:36:51,910 --> 10:36:54,309
So I'm happy that people are not doing that.

2969
10:36:54,309 --> 10:37:01,050
And they're sharing stories like this.

2970
10:37:01,050 --> 10:37:05,400
Thank you so much for the $10.

2971
10:37:05,400 --> 10:37:13,680
Means a lot, it really does.

2972
10:37:13,680 --> 10:37:16,239
Hey, Greco Twitch, thanks for a thousand bits.

2973
10:37:16,239 --> 10:37:17,680
No message, just a thousand bits.

2974
10:37:17,720 --> 10:37:24,629
Just $10 deposited into my twitch.tv bank account.

2975
10:37:24,629 --> 10:37:26,269
Bonjour Tristan, thanks for the 500 bits.

2976
10:37:26,269 --> 10:37:27,669
Hey Jerma, I just wanted to share an idea.

2977
10:37:27,669 --> 10:37:30,589
I often watch your streams and VODs while cooking.

2978
10:37:30,589 --> 10:37:31,430
I'm thinking it'd be funny

2979
10:37:31,430 --> 10:37:33,910
if you did a follow along cooking vid

2980
10:37:33,910 --> 10:37:35,430
for a really hard dish.

2981
10:37:35,430 --> 10:37:37,029
Then we could all share our results together

2982
10:37:37,029 --> 10:37:38,750
in the sub or something.

2983
10:37:38,750 --> 10:37:41,309
Anyways, just a thought and thanks for the streams.

2984
10:37:44,610 --> 10:37:46,889
Whenever I watch your videos, I pog my pants.

2985
10:37:46,889 --> 10:37:51,500
Oh, that's, thank you.

2986
10:37:51,500 --> 10:37:54,139
There's cooking stuff that's starting to be worked on.

2987
10:37:54,739 --> 10:37:56,220
It's just kind of weird.

2988
10:37:57,620 --> 10:38:04,419
We'll see.

2989
10:38:04,419 --> 10:38:06,059
Zero giblets, thanks for the 500 bits.

2990
10:38:06,059 --> 10:38:08,019
Hey Jerma, I haven't given anything in a while,

2991
10:38:08,019 --> 10:38:10,220
so I figured I should show some love.

2992
10:38:10,220 --> 10:38:11,059
Keep on keeping on.

2993
10:38:11,059 --> 10:38:13,019
Oh, and when you address my message in chat,

2994
10:38:13,019 --> 10:38:14,620
among the many others,

2995
10:38:14,620 --> 10:38:16,419
it's like the lucky maiden in the crowd

2996
10:38:16,419 --> 10:38:18,099
whose favor the night chooses.

2997
10:38:18,099 --> 10:38:27,080
Thanks.

2998
10:38:27,080 --> 10:38:28,339
Thank you.

2999
10:38:28,339 --> 10:38:30,580
I appreciate it.

3000
10:38:30,580 --> 10:38:32,260
Hey Gondolaine, thanks for the 250.

3001
10:38:32,260 --> 10:38:33,580
Hey Jerbo, it's been a year

3002
10:38:33,580 --> 10:38:36,339
since your famous 700,000 game stream.

3003
10:38:36,419 --> 10:38:38,819
I think it's about time you give us a prequel stream,

3004
10:38:38,819 --> 10:38:41,510
where you stream the games that started it all.

3005
10:38:41,510 --> 10:38:43,870
These are a collection of really shitty games

3006
10:38:43,870 --> 10:38:46,269
and these are unique,

3007
10:38:46,269 --> 10:38:49,949
unlike the 700,000 games by Viva Media.

3008
10:38:49,949 --> 10:38:54,300
It'd be worthy for a fuckface shovelware stream.

3009
10:38:54,300 --> 10:38:58,379
This is called 555 Games, XP Championship Edition.

3010
10:39:02,230 --> 10:39:03,870
All right, fine, yeah, I'll buy it.

3011
10:39:03,870 --> 10:39:05,879
I'll buy it right now.

3012
10:39:05,879 --> 10:39:11,360
All right, yeah, sounds good.

3013
10:39:11,360 --> 10:39:15,209
Hopefully there's a super frog in it.

3014
10:39:15,209 --> 10:39:19,199
I'll see you guys tomorrow for Tony Hawk.

3015
10:39:19,199 --> 10:39:21,120
Take care, buddy.

3016
10:39:21,120 --> 10:39:22,680
Two more bits to do.

3017
10:39:22,680 --> 10:39:24,400
I know it's another late one.

3018
10:39:24,400 --> 10:39:26,639
We've done a few late long streams this week,

3019
10:39:26,639 --> 10:39:28,319
but remember, I'm not gonna be here

3020
10:39:28,319 --> 10:39:31,080
for almost a full week next week.

3021
10:39:31,080 --> 10:39:34,919
So I'm happy to do four or five

3022
10:39:34,919 --> 10:39:36,519
of these long streams in a row.

3023
10:39:38,730 --> 10:39:40,569
Cornflake, thanks for the 500 bits.

3024
10:39:40,569 --> 10:39:42,370
Small brain streamer, you just don't get it.

3025
10:39:42,370 --> 10:39:43,209
I get it.

3026
10:39:43,209 --> 10:39:46,610
I have read countless explanations on Reddit.

3027
10:39:46,610 --> 10:39:50,410
I am, that's it, they trailed off.

3028
10:39:50,410 --> 10:39:53,169
There's nothing there.

3029
10:39:53,169 --> 10:39:54,889
Hey, all the chemists, thanks for the 500 bits.

3030
10:39:54,889 --> 10:39:57,129
I dare you to read the Reddit summary on stream.

3031
10:39:57,129 --> 10:39:58,410
No, no, no, no, no, no.

3032
10:39:58,410 --> 10:39:59,690
Somebody might have clicked on the stream

3033
10:39:59,690 --> 10:40:02,410
and not played the game and they just get like a TLDR

3034
10:40:02,410 --> 10:40:03,809
and the whole game's ruined.

3035
10:40:06,150 --> 10:40:09,150
Cap'n spurt dick, thanks for the 500 bits.

3036
10:40:09,150 --> 10:40:12,830
I said the dick part of that, so emphasized.

3037
10:40:12,830 --> 10:40:14,550
It's been almost 11 hours.

3038
10:40:14,550 --> 10:40:16,790
Give me just a little slack.

3039
10:40:16,790 --> 10:40:20,319
They just say Jeremy.

3040
10:40:21,040 --> 10:40:22,120
Jeremy who?

3041
10:40:22,120 --> 10:40:23,120
Jeremy me?

3042
10:40:23,120 --> 10:40:25,319
Or Jeremy you?

3043
10:40:25,319 --> 10:40:29,120
See you guys tomorrow, have a good night.

3044
10:40:29,120 --> 10:40:34,660
Tony Hawk's Underground tomorrow, have a good night.
