1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:12,230
What? Oh, right. Look, I cannot be responsible if you're going to bet on this shit.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:20,170
Uh, hello. How are you? Good to see everybody. Where's my coaster? I have a coaster or something.

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:31,589
There we go. He is responsible. Hope you're doing well, everybody. Let me tweet this.

4
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:53,000
Let me get this frog out of my throat. Okay, so today we're going to complete Pikmin 2.

5
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,939
I'm going to finish it. We're going to go over a few things. Some very important things.

6
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:05,620
3.6 million points. Half of you guys are going to be rich and half of you are going to be broke

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:17,609
in channel points. If this keeps going on the way that it is. 22,000 points. Omega low.

8
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:30,969
But anyways, we've got a lot of things to talk about. Streams are going to be a little different.

9
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:35,700
Not anything major. Just something a little different. So for the next...

10
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:47,079
It's today. It is the 12th. For the next three weeks, streams are going to be shorter.

11
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:56,840
We're going to pull back the streams a little. Because on March 6th, it's going to be a very

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:06,260
major stream. I can confirm with 100% certainty, with absolute certainty, the archaeology stream

13
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:20,629
will be happening on Saturday, the 6th of March, at 1 p.m. Pacific time. That's true. Yes, the

14
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:25,530
archaeology stream is happening before the Catboy stream. You don't have a date for that one. I'm

15
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,610
not giving you a date for that one. You're just going to have to be watching, okay?

16
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:42,409
That is not a Catboy stream. I'm going to make that very clear. It's not a Catboy. No Catboy

17
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:50,840
Archaeologist. No, that's not happening. That's a separate stream. So there's a lot of stuff that

18
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,419
we're doing. There's a lot of work that we're doing on this. It should be a lot of fun. I hope

19
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:03,930
it is. But got to put time into it. So I'm still going to be streaming, but just not the same

20
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:14,020
amount of time. We'd rather... What were you saying? We'd rather longer streams than four hours of one

21
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:21,860
gimmick stream every six months. That's what you want. What about what I want? Is this your channel?

22
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:32,169
Do you run the show here? Do I give you the keys? You want the keys to the house?

23
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:43,669
I'll give them to you. You want them? Here, take them. Run it. Man, you ain't getting these

24
00:03:43,669 --> 00:04:07,159
fucking keys. They're mine. It's going to be a lot of fun. You have several billion dollars in debt.

25
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,759
I think we own this. No, no, no, no, no, no. The collateral for that debt was not the channel.

26
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,009
It was my Funko Pop collection. That was my collateral. And when I went in and got the loan,

27
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:38,420
I told you. You got just $62 in collateral for your $5 billion. How's that? No, but in all honesty,

28
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:47,189
yeah, I'm going to do what I want to do. That's the way it is. That's the way it's always been.

29
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:55,689
You might be a new viewer. That's the way that this has been for almost a decade. Not sure how

30
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:04,279
long you've been watching, but that's how we do it. I was going to scream. Let's go as loud as I

31
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:25,560
could. Let's go. This guy spent almost $100 on Funkos. Oh, God. Can you imagine? He wants to be

32
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:37,639
a cat boy. All right, you ready to go? Are we ready to play? I'm not doing this on camera ever

33
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:47,589
again. I promise you that. All right, let's get it over. Whoa, I almost turned the stream off.

34
00:05:47,589 --> 00:06:02,089
That would have been bad. It was not on, right? All right, where are we going? Where were we off

35
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:15,319
to? It was on. No, it wasn't. Shirtless Andy. How close am I to the end of the game? Am I almost

36
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:31,850
done? A few hours or something, right? I drained that pool the last time, right? I'm not putting

37
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:40,019
the face game on. No, I don't care. You're not getting that. There's a whole post-game area? Oh,

38
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:49,800
cool. All right. All right, so I want to go to that pool that we drained. I'm going on an adventure

39
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,240
with blue because somebody said that it's all blue, right? Blocking the goddamn Wiimote sensor bar

40
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:09,370
with a cup of coffee. You look less handsome today, Jerma. No, I look great today. You know

41
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,339
how I know? Because I got one of those apps that scans your face and tells you how hot you are.

42
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:32,439
I got an 8.5. I'm going to go on a grind mission today. I downloaded this app called

43
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:39,319
Are You Ugly or Not? It scans your face. You hold it up to your friend and it goes

44
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,680
across the forward-facing camera and then it says you're ugly confirmed. They look at the camera

45
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,839
and they're like, what? It takes a screenshot of their reaction. It's fucking hilarious. Okay,

46
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:14,040
where am I going? And then they go, what's this app? Is this a prank? Where am I going? All right,

47
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:21,399
shower room. Is that a spoiler? I need to kill stuff. I need to grind to pick up some blue guys.

48
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:39,139
That's a good place to grind to get blues. Anybody know? Just kill animals, right? All right,

49
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:47,669
pull back. Blue, put it to blue. You're going blue, right? I want blue. Not here and it's not

50
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:55,210
a good place to do it. Grind? They all live? Yeah, what do you mean? They're fine. What are you

51
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:07,029
talking about? All right, I want blue on there. How many blues should I get to go into the shower

52
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:16,580
room? Does it matter? No, I want the good red. A little Pikmin chant noise has been what?

53
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:31,100
5k Andy. Shut up. Whatever. The fact that that person voted oh, megalul after that. It's like,

54
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:41,210
come on, dude. It's like, look, I'm going to be really honest. I think that's funny every time.

55
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:50,539
I don't know why. It's like rude. That's wicked rude, isn't it? I got only five. I don't know. I

56
00:09:50,539 --> 00:10:04,230
don't know. I think it's funny. The submerged castle in the shower room. All right, well, hold

57
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:12,710
on. Let me. I need to get all blue, right? That's what you guys told me. You told me that you need

58
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:29,159
a blue for that one. 5k Andy. That's wicked funny, dude. Oh, shit. Maybe 6k Andy. Castle is blue,

59
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,169
not shower. Okay. So the shower, I can just go with whatever I want. Well, I got some blues.

60
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:42,090
That's good. I need a different team then. Who the fuck is Andy? Well, look, you got like five

61
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:49,610
straight years of like Twitch dialogue that you have to go through. I'm not going to tell you all

62
00:10:49,610 --> 00:11:02,419
about that. I'm going to take 25 blues. I can't wait till 50 years in the future go by. And there

63
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:06,570
are historians that are going to have to be like memeologists. That won't be like a weird thing to

64
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:19,289
say. 30 red. How many yellows do I want? Some of you guys are going to be fucking 80 years old

65
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:24,740
on like the history channel talking about like Kappa and like explaining what it is.

66
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:49,480
It's called a historian. Well, yeah, but like that's not what you'd be called. It is. It's not,

67
00:11:49,480 --> 00:12:00,919
though. You're a memeologist. You're a meme historian. Yeah, whatever. Okay. I want to go

68
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:19,820
to that shower. It's over here on the right, right? Yeah. Wait, isn't there... I saw eggs.

69
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:29,990
Fuck it. Who cares? We'll get those later. 98. What do you mean 98? Get over here. Get over here.

70
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,500
Meme historian. Yeah. Okay. Meme historian Andy. Yep. So you'd be like Jeffrey Anderson and

71
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,549
underneath it would say meme historian Andy. All right. Nobody's going to die from this, right?

72
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,700
Okay. This is... I should be good. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What do you mean 63 out of 100 entering?

73
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:12,809
What are you talking about? Get over here. Why do they stop? Why do they stop? What are you guys

74
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:23,480
doing? Get over here. 90 out of 100. What? Guys, why are they detaching from me?

75
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:40,259
Come here. Oh my god, you idiot. 85. What are they doing? What do you mean 84? What are you

76
00:13:40,259 --> 00:14:01,129
talking about? What? Why did I just lose another... What the hell is going on? What happened to the

77
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:10,899
other ones? I'm so confused right now. I don't understand. I had 100. Where the fuck did they

78
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:29,240
go? Okay. They're just buried into the corner? That was really bizarre. They're just stuck in

79
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:39,620
this corner, deep buried into here. Oh, fuck off game. Give me a break. Yeah, of course. There

80
00:14:39,620 --> 00:15:07,350
you go. It was a bunch of small blue Andes. Okay. Whatever. Sorry. All right. So this is the shower

81
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:21,779
level. I'm looking forward to this. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Whoa. Back up. All right. I got to...

82
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:32,570
All right. We need... That's fire, right? Whoa. I'm resetting. I'm resetting. I'm going to reset.

83
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,889
I'm going to reset. That was fucking bullshit. He killed almost every blue Pikmin. I'm resetting.

84
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:40,649
Okay. I'm resetting. We're resetting. That's a reset. I'm just going to turn the console off

85
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:50,179
and we'll come back. God damn it. Hold on. Just here. There's some cool... Look at this artwork.

86
00:15:50,740 --> 00:16:11,669
Look at this artwork. God damn it. Really? The first thing I do... All right. If he didn't kill

87
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:17,750
almost every single blue Pikmin, I wouldn't have cared. But like that was... He wasn't... The guy

88
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,950
wasn't even on screen. He was off screen when he did that. That's fucking horseshit. No, I'm not

89
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:40,309
living with that one. I don't care. It's dumb. How come my Wii pointer's not working? The hell?

90
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:50,220
The Wii pointer doesn't work anymore. What the fuck is happening? I actually cannot... The pointer's

91
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:57,129
not on the screen anymore. God, how much was this thing selling for when it came out? I hope it was

92
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:05,799
like 50 bucks. Not like 500. How much fucking was this console? What the... Hold on. Let me pick up

93
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:17,339
my brick over here with a screen on it. Let me go over... Hold on. One sec. Wii sensor bar settings.

94
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:28,940
Give me the... Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. How's the sensitivity? Why did this thing change sensitivity

95
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:37,690
randomly? This doesn't make any sense. What the fuck is happening? Oh, the ooey gooey. This doesn't...

96
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:49,349
I don't... I have no idea what's going on. Why is it doing this? My Wiimote doesn't even work anymore.

97
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,380
I'm not even kidding. I swear to God. The Wiimote's not even showing up on the screen.

98
00:17:54,019 --> 00:18:05,509
What the... Where's the Wiimote? It thinks I'm holding the Wiimote upside down.

99
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:14,039
What the hell are you talking about? This thing better have been fucking less than 40 dollars

100
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:24,329
when it came out. This is a 40 dollar machine. At most, by the way. At most. The Wiimote upside down?

101
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:38,250
No! What the fuck is it doing this for? I'm gonna take the batteries out. There's usually... The two

102
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:46,630
dots are side by side. Why is it... So I'm tilting the controller. It's 30, 40 degrees sideways now.

103
00:18:46,630 --> 00:19:00,869
I'm gonna just... There's supposed to be two dots right next to each other. I just did this before

104
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:05,670
I turned the stream on. Like, I literally just did this before the stream turned on 20 minutes ago.

105
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:20,339
Fucking 40 dollar machine. Look at some artwork. I'll be right back. Sensor bar below TV.

106
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:31,500
Repair this fucking thing. I don't understand. Why is it doing this? Because I turned the console off?

107
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:42,200
Check the TV for more information. Some explanations can be scrolled using this. No,

108
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:55,220
I don't have any info on the TV. I think this Wiimote just broke. Dude, this Wiimote just is

109
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:08,039
bricked. It's not even turning on anymore. What? Why? How? What? What? No, it's not. All right,

110
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:23,180
hold on. I've just received the batteries. What the fuck is going on? Dude, it's... This thing is broken

111
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:36,890
as hell. This shit's broken. I don't know what to do. What do I do? Let me try to read. This is

112
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,690
ridiculous. I have no idea what's going on. I seriously have no idea. I don't know why it's

113
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,000
doing this. It's not like Cheeto dust on the front of the camera or something, right?

114
00:20:45,720 --> 00:21:05,500
Put in new batteries? It was at like 60%. Let me see if it works. It won't even show up on the

115
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:20,630
screen. I'm sorry. This is just bizarre. A $40 console. This is the longest fail bit ever. I wish

116
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,549
this was a joke. It's a... No, it's not a joke. It's a $40 at most console. Would they sell this for

117
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:42,220
fucking 500 bucks? The Wiimote's broken. It's actually broken. I can't use it. I actually

118
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,640
cannot even point at the screen anymore. Whatever. Me turning the console off and turning it back on

119
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:55,690
bricked the Wiimote. Let me get new batteries. Give me one second. This is stupid. I'll be right

120
00:21:55,690 --> 00:24:43,259
back. Okay. So I did the tried and true method. The tried and true method is I smacked it like

121
00:24:43,259 --> 00:25:09,420
three or four times and now I have two dots. I don't know why. For some reason, I thought

122
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,460
it was a really dark camera and you could see me. I was naked in front of this or something.

123
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:35,019
All right. Let's go. I didn't want to cancel that. Three nipples? What? Get out of here.

124
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:52,170
Those are my nipples. Okay. That's best one guy. That's best one guy moment of the week at least.

125
00:25:52,170 --> 00:26:10,119
All right. Let's go. Just moving around. Oh my fucking god. This fucking console. I swear to

126
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:17,099
god. What is it doing? Leave me alone. I don't want to log back in. Go to the Miiverse? No. Go

127
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:32,789
to hell. How does that sound? I don't want to go to the fucking Miiverse. Get out of here. Okay.

128
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,529
So, hey everybody. Welcome to the stream. Today, we're going to be playing Pikmin 2. I'm going to

129
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,450
be jumping back into Pikmin 2. I'm going to finish the game tonight, get to at least a place where

130
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,500
I get to the end game, mess around for a little bit. Oh yeah, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

348
01:03:16,469 --> 01:03:23,760
that because they're all so damn slow they're all so slow it's unbelievable I

349
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:37,840
got rocket boots and they don't have rocket boots run oh my god this room

01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:59,559
sucks get up here run run run run run run all right well he's in the other

351
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:12,559
room I was our opportunity to kill these guys one by one okay honestly I'm in

352
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,360
with the Wiimote seriously like it's okay you know like this console aiming

353
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:24,079
like analog aiming like console aiming this is like a next level version of

354
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,880
console aiming it's because my brain knows exactly where it wants to go and

355
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,119
it's kind of like a mouse the code control is kind of good but it's almost

356
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:37,159
like there's like a person in my brain and in my arm like holding my hands back

357
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:43,860
and my stick again it's getting a putting a wall up in my brain it's such

358
01:04:43,860 --> 01:05:04,800
like a horrible in between of like console aiming and mouse I'm pretty

359
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:13,400
fine we're not running out of purples am I I let them bait it out go ahead all

360
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:21,090
right get in I had purple selected I like like is there a way that I can make

361
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:24,329
it so it does not select another pick but I can lock this shit in it's so

362
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:28,130
annoying I don't even care if I don't have enough I know it's because they're

363
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:39,000
not behind me but I don't want to select another one and throw it get to the

364
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:58,420
don't miss the first row I feel like I'm cleaning somebody else's teeth okay

365
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:01,940
that's how I've always felt using a Wiimote with a game that requires this

366
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:19,099
I'm like a fucking dentist holding my hand up like aiming leaning forward with

367
01:06:19,099 --> 01:06:24,219
a little device have to be very careful very intricate lean forward move twist

368
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:29,739
small wrist movements and I can't put it on I can't rest my arm see this is a

369
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,820
mouse if I could have like have it on the ground and moving around like why

370
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:37,760
can't I why can't it be mouse mode the Wiimote should have a mouse mode convince

371
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:55,219
me that I'm wrong they would have sold billions you're just doing a Trump voice

372
01:06:55,219 --> 01:07:20,300
why was was I I don't I wasn't even aware of it kind of was I literally no

373
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:41,719
oh but that was good go this way no I is there a dig I feel like there's

374
01:07:41,719 --> 01:08:02,980
something on the ground here yeah there is right no all right up there get over

408
01:13:49,420 --> 01:14:02,750

409
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:14,880
Redemption so what why what a specific thing to say that's oh like what like

410
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:22,289
you're a good boy you murdered that guy in Red Dead Redemption um I guess like I

411
01:14:22,289 --> 01:14:27,529
may have like killed like a civilian in Red Dead Redemption and you've got even

412
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:34,649
on that even stuck on that for like a year two years you think you're such a

413
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:40,130
good boy what about that time that you shot that guy in Red Dead Redemption I

414
01:14:40,130 --> 01:14:45,170
haven't forgotten you have oh yeah when you were playing Grand Theft Auto that

415
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,569
time and you drove on the sidewalk accidentally and you hit that

416
01:14:47,569 --> 01:15:06,550
pedestrian don't act like you're so good mr. Albertson we know okay you're

417
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:12,760
gonna do a personality test on stream uh we did that not that long ago we did a

418
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:28,880
whole bunch of quizzes and tests um few months ago I mean do more I want to do

419
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,979
more tea I love tier lists I've done so many tier lists but I think there's so

420
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:51,119
much more things to rank you know saying I love doing those it's so much fun just

421
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:57,569
white flower okay the Pikmin tier list okay sure I don't need a tier list for

422
01:15:57,569 --> 01:16:04,119
that I can just tell you right now um I kind of need a look at them any good

423
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:19,979
look purple s purple s yellow a red and blue B and then white like C or D tear

424
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:41,029

01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,600
you get hit in the face of the purple then it's just knocks you out for a

456
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,380
sec you have to actually land them like on top of their butt not like on their

457

471
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:19,800
minutes hey that's not a bad one to do okay let's go what are you willing to bet

472
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:26,119

475
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:36,470
emotion for 10 minutes no it's no jokey voices for 10 minutes define a funny

476
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:45,050
voice okay a funny voice is defined as one that is very very far away from my

477
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:49,960
speaking voice one that is so detached from my normal speaking voice like this

478
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,029
like okay yo I was stupid although the Wiimote sucks it's not we want a piece

479
01:26:55,029 --> 01:26:59,649
of shit that's like normal right I'm talking about like by the way this

480
01:26:59,649 --> 01:27:06,850
hasn't started yet I'm talking about like and I said that the infrared

481
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:10,250
technology was the best and they were wrong they were completely wrong so like

482
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:13,930
that would be a jokey voice right I guess if I was gonna do like an impression of

483
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:21,479
that no it hasn't started no no I said it hasn't started yet it starts when I

484

485
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:38,220
that's that's very detached from the way I'm speaking normally okay we're gonna

486
01:27:38,739 --> 01:27:42,420
begin this after the betting starts by the way what I'm not gonna do this till

is it this hard to do but all weird right it might not be a funny voice not

572
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:34,649
all funny voices are screams but all screams are funny sounds which all

573
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:39,039
screams are funny voices what I'm so confused you guys obviously can't figure

574
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:54,220
this out either I'm having trouble too 51 49 I gotta keep it open okay this is

575
01:42:54,220 --> 01:43:00,640
getting close I'm gonna give it to you again if you haven't voted you have a

576
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:07,279
very this is important it's separated by like 15 votes funny sound does not

577
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:13,979
equal a funny voice interesting theory that's right but the shme shaping my

578
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:19,489
vocal cords to make that funny sound is me making funny sounds with my voice so

579
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:32,029
therefore it could be a funny voice I have no idea it's tricky are you guys

580
01:43:32,029 --> 01:43:36,760
deciding are you getting close all right I've given you the reasons for and the

581
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:53,130
reasons for not that's noise does not equal best impression good point okay

582
01:43:53,130 --> 01:44:01,010
it's he's tricking us no I'm just telling you what people would say about

583
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:09,010
it all right okay okay I'm about to close this poll there's your last chance

584
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:21,279
I'm gonna give you I'm gonna be a 10 20 seconds last chance does it count does

585
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:40,470
this is a weird funny scream a funny voice damn it it's so it's too close it

586
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:53,880
wouldn't let me vote I I can't close the poll until it's very clear what the

587
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:03,350
fuck close it I can't close it look at it look at this it's separated by like 10

588
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:17,899
people it's never gonna be clear this sucks I'm I'm trying to be democratic

589
01:45:17,899 --> 01:45:28,399
about this but what the hell I should have just flipped a coin okay all right

590
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:43,590
I'm in 10 seconds I'm closing it 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 it counts it counts all

591
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:48,229
right it did counts that's when I closed it it counts a funny weird scream counts

592
01:45:48,229 --> 01:45:52,109
as like making a funny voice okay at least for this particular stream let's

593
01:45:52,109 --> 01:46:10,180
go do it again I should just flip the coin by the way this does not start

594
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:19,670
until the betting is over yeah to be clear okay I almost just leaned into the

595
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:28,300
mic and did Obama the you know let me let me be clear right I almost just did

596
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:31,300
that I was leaning into dinner I was leaning to do an Obama impression I

597
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:47,699
almost did that and but it wouldn't even counted it hasn't counted yet so I can

598
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:57,869
until the vote until they're all in all right let's go just don't talk all right

844
02:27:03,549 --> 02:27:07,530

851
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:12,079
much as I can it's very difficult to do this and still play the video game at

852
02:28:12,079 --> 02:28:17,579
the same time I'll tell you it's not easy all of my concentration is

853
02:28:17,579 --> 02:28:22,819
completely just front-loaded into the top of my head to only talk in a weird

854
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:31,760
way I don't I have no idea I've got my time and trouble playing the game it's

855
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:41,479
already halfway through the day so I can't get that treasure but I can do

856
02:28:41,479 --> 02:28:50,590
what else is left to do so I can turn around and go the other way which I can

857
02:28:50,590 --> 02:29:08,129

891
02:35:39,579 --> 02:35:46,979
don't care I just I'm trying to keep my normal speaking voice from coming out at

this is Bernie this is Bernie if it Bernie is morphing into a bunch of

899
02:36:52,780 --> 02:37:00,129
things but it's morphing into German guy again Bernie is morphing into guy that

900
02:37:00,129 --> 02:37:06,709
speaks like this I'm getting close to losing I am that was not asleep that was

901

906
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:04,159
desperation looks like cuz every time I try to do this and try to shave off the

907
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:10,680
debt it never works and I always look like a fucking asshole every single time

908
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:22,829
I just look like a fucking idiot it makes me look really stupid I want to go

909

919
02:40:26,659 --> 02:40:39,450
clear I could and I did I did it well what are you talking about not a slip

920
02:40:39,450 --> 02:40:48,940
this is non-slip this is rockabama that's not a slip not sound sort of like

921
02:40:48,940 --> 02:41:32,979
the way that I kind of talk a little but now I know you make me go I'm gonna be

922
02:41:32,979 --> 02:41:38,040
in debt forever um let me explain what happened I started to do Barack Obama

923
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:43,629
started doing Barack Obama everyone said slipped slip slip slip slip slip slip

924
02:41:43,629 --> 02:41:46,670
slip and then I struck and then I started to make Barack Obama's voice

925
02:41:46,670 --> 02:41:50,510
sounds fucking horrible so I didn't want to make it sound like I was doing a

926
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:53,590
really shitty Barack Obama so I was correct I was telling you guys that oh

927
02:41:53,590 --> 02:42:07,889
look at how bad my Barack Obama sounds now no slip what do you mean I won I did

928
02:42:07,889 --> 02:42:27,309
it did I actually do it watch the clip and pull it all right let's watch the

929
02:42:27,309 --> 02:42:48,799
clip I'm slipping I think a lot of you guys just fucking feel bad let me hear

930
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:54,090
it let's say I'm gonna I want to hear it where is it

931
02:42:54,090 --> 02:43:13,659
we said Obama slips let's see no and I did let me be perfectly clear I could

932
02:43:13,659 --> 02:43:25,010
and I did I did it well what are you talking about not a slip this is

933
02:43:25,010 --> 02:43:34,430
not slip this is Barack Obama that's not slip my sound sort of lack the way that I

934
02:43:34,430 --> 02:43:40,719
kind of talk a little but now I know you make me go I was Bernie Sanders into

935
02:43:40,719 --> 02:43:48,659
Mario getting his ass lit on fire I kind of talk a little but now I know now

936
02:43:48,659 --> 02:43:55,209
night and not now I yeah that was Bernie Sanders then turning into Mario getting

937
02:43:55,209 --> 02:43:59,370
his ass lit on fire go I know you make me go I but now I know you make me go

938
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:05,370
now you make now you make me go on now you make me go on that's not a slip

939
02:44:05,370 --> 02:44:18,739
that's Bernie Sanders I think we're good but now I know you make me go so in

940
02:44:18,739 --> 02:44:37,700
question is was that a slip fucking stupid thing I've ever done let me give

941
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:40,899
you let me give it to you again so you understand what you know what you're

942
02:44:40,899 --> 02:44:54,090
doing here but now I know you make me go on the slip was that Bernie Sanders

943
02:44:54,090 --> 02:45:10,520
just just seamlessly going into a loud funny like Ren and Stimpy scream it was

944
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:20,670
seamless it was seamless Bernie Sanders now you make me go loud equals funny

945
02:45:20,670 --> 02:45:40,350
exactly absolutely you're right absolutely loud equals funny 1 billion

946
02:45:40,350 --> 02:45:55,149
1.5 billion compromise I'm sick yeah we got a vote this is a no-slip by the way

947
02:45:55,149 --> 02:46:01,379
alright that's a 1.5 billion compromise I'll take 500 we'll take 500 million off

948
02:46:01,379 --> 02:46:08,479
the debt for me maybe maybe an awkward transition between Bernie going into

949
02:46:08,479 --> 02:46:17,059
Mario lighting his ass on fire alright deal deal deal alright let's go I'm

950
02:46:17,059 --> 02:46:27,940
gonna play the game now I'm getting a fucking face cam it was so painful that

951
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:42,510
sucked that was the worst that's oh yeah is it worth like the potentially okay

952
02:46:42,510 --> 02:46:48,670
yeah I get that compromise is it worth you'd shave 500 million off that one

953
02:46:48,670 --> 02:46:51,750
point five billion compromise that's fine you know how many people left the

954
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:54,979
stream because they couldn't take it anymore and they probably won't come

955
02:46:54,979 --> 02:47:06,750
back I just lost out on people gained viewers yeah but how many did we lose

956
02:47:06,750 --> 02:47:21,430
getting to viewers all right let me get a where is where we at

957
02:47:21,430 --> 02:47:33,799
bang go this way now you're gonna lose viewers yeah that's probably oh well

958
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:49,309
okay 83 how many do I have now double or nothing absolutely not I absolutely not

959

addicting by the way I just want to make it really clear I'm not I don't hate

1210
03:43:28,790 --> 03:43:35,180
Pokemon Pokemon school it's an interesting concept I think the show was

1211
03:43:35,180 --> 03:43:37,899
interesting I like I thought it was interesting that was cool it was a cool

1212
03:43:37,899 --> 03:43:43,700
show it was worth watching I would say I want to make sure I go back to that

1213
03:43:43,700 --> 03:43:46,659
because people were pretty probably upset about that I don't mean that I

1214
03:43:47,299 --> 03:43:58,510
do that sometimes that's what we do they make up fake scenarios oh yeah oh yeah my

1215
03:43:58,510 --> 03:44:04,629
allowance doubled and it's all thanks to my papa after all he's a great captain

1216
03:44:04,629 --> 03:44:15,479

1217
03:44:15,479 --> 03:44:32,040
all right I want that thing both they're buried up it's probably worth a hundred

1218
03:44:32,040 --> 03:44:43,190
two hundred bucks it's worth it so he's gonna go dig it I need some

1219
03:44:43,190 --> 03:44:46,229
white I only have six white Pikmin that's horrible

1220
03:44:46,229 --> 03:44:56,760
Pikmin's cooler than Jerma I mean there's some facets of Pikmin that are

1221
03:44:56,760 --> 03:45:01,530
cooler than me I still think I had my coolness factor is a little bit higher

1222
03:45:01,530 --> 03:45:25,690
than Pikmin by just a small amount I think so I'm more red coolness factor

1223
03:45:25,690 --> 03:45:34,829
all right not wasting time let's just get over there and do it don't lose

1378
04:24:58,409 --> 04:25:04,209
should just make the ground concrete in this game like it's so ugly just kidding

1379
04:25:04,209 --> 04:25:39,100
I'm sorry oops all I'm saying is it should have been a cartoon like what

1380
04:25:39,100 --> 04:25:45,079
would it come on this is a perfect cartoon Hickman 1, Hickman 2, Hickman 3

04:26:46,250 --> 04:26:53,549
don't know if I can I'm kind of scared to do that am I is it really gotten to

1386
04:26:53,549 --> 04:26:56,069
the point where I'm afraid to like watch a YouTube video of like a show or

1387
04:26:56,069 --> 04:27:23,500
something it is technically Nintendo video right Nintendo doesn't fuck around

1388
04:27:23,500 --> 04:27:35,370
anymore no entertainment is illegal didn't you know that yeah well I know

1389
04:27:35,370 --> 04:27:39,350
people saying what about Bionicle yeah Bionicle is free to watch on YouTube

1390
04:27:39,350 --> 04:27:45,020
that does not mean it is free for me to distribute on my stream there's a thought

1391
04:27:45,059 --> 04:27:58,989
of legality there oh my god I need that pinecone I do not have the broadcasting

1392
04:27:58,989 --> 04:28:03,250
rights to the Bionicle movie it's how this works just because something is

1393
04:28:03,250 --> 04:28:08,219
free does not mean that I can just do whatever I want with it just hold up a

1394
04:28:08,219 --> 04:28:11,219
controller and pretend it's a video game didn't somebody do that at one point for

1395
04:28:11,219 --> 04:28:22,430
like a Super Bowl kill kill kill kill kill kill kill hurry hurry up please

1396
04:28:22,430 --> 04:28:30,340
we're good it was UFC that's so stupid that's

1397
04:28:30,379 --> 04:28:41,659
unbelievable but now I I cannot just stream the Bionicle movie I do not have

1398
04:28:41,659 --> 04:28:46,700
the rights to I don't have the broadcasting rights to Bionicle which I

1399
04:28:46,700 --> 04:28:56,629
need to be able to show that on stream and is it correct me if I'm wrong here

1400
04:28:56,629 --> 04:29:04,690
but Bionicle is Disney is it not I don't think that's gonna happen isn't that

1401
04:29:04,690 --> 04:29:31,540
underneath the Disney umbrella it's a Lego hold on Bionicle Bionicle who owns

1402
04:29:31,540 --> 04:29:41,440
Bionicle Lego would never be able to watch it it's Lego wait Lego is

1403
04:29:41,440 --> 04:29:50,260
Bionicle but isn't who owns Lego is Lego just Lego and somebody own Lego is a

1404
04:29:50,260 --> 04:29:56,579
Warner Lego just is Lego but who has like who has like the rights to like the

1405
04:29:56,579 --> 04:30:16,190
Lego movies and stuff and Lego media TV shows and stuff John Lego I thought it

1406
04:30:16,190 --> 04:30:20,219
was Disney I thought Disney had like the broadcasting rights to like Bionicle or

1407
04:30:20,219 --> 04:30:22,659
something I don't know why I thought that I know where I got that from what I

1408
04:30:22,659 --> 04:30:35,430
get that from they do okay so I was right this present be extremely careful

1409
04:30:35,430 --> 04:30:46,180
all the more your job is to protect his life at all costs

1410
04:30:46,180 --> 04:30:54,620
hello it's me mr. Bionicle Jerva go right ahead thank you mr. Bionicle I

1411
04:30:54,620 --> 04:31:04,350
really appreciate that okay I got treasures over here but where is it oh

1412
04:31:04,350 --> 04:31:29,500
fuck run away holy shit there's too many things over here yeah the Lego group is

1413
04:31:29,500 --> 04:31:33,139
owned by a certain company but the dish the distribution rights to the Bionicle

1414
04:31:33,139 --> 04:31:48,250
movies I don't think is Lego so I'm trying to say run run run run run run I

1415
04:31:48,250 --> 04:31:57,719
think I'm just dead here it is Disney people saying no it is I think it is

1416
04:31:57,719 --> 04:32:04,059
though I actually do think it is it's distributed by Buena Vista which is

1417
04:32:04,059 --> 04:32:30,170
Disney right yeah I had it right there's so many enemies here it's just just a

1418
04:32:30,170 --> 04:32:46,850
mess this is a mess right now didn't I drain this water already I thought I

1419
04:32:46,850 --> 04:33:09,080
already drained this oh whatever this place is cool but not really I mean

1420
04:33:09,080 --> 04:33:17,130
Disney does not have rights okay regardless if it's Disney or Warner or

1421
04:33:17,130 --> 04:33:23,490
Buena Vista or paramount whatever it doesn't matter it's not me I don't own

1422
04:33:23,490 --> 04:33:41,750
the right can't stream it buy out Windows Vista no Buena Vista okay I'll

1423
04:33:41,750 --> 04:33:52,500
add I'll see you guys tomorrow buy them you millionaire listen even if I let's

1424
04:33:52,500 --> 04:33:55,459
just say I had let's just say I was right let's just say it was a millionaire

1425
04:33:55,500 --> 04:33:58,619
you know how much it's gonna cost to buy Bionicle probably like more that yeah

1426
04:33:58,619 --> 04:34:08,479
gotta probably add a zero or two it's probably quite a few zeros to buy

1427
04:34:08,479 --> 04:34:16,689
Bionicle to stream it the one movie I guarantee it's least it's at least 10

1428
04:34:16,689 --> 04:34:33,459
million to buy the rights to Bionicle and that would be a steal I got some

1429
04:34:33,459 --> 04:34:41,560
treasure though ask them nicely you know I did who knows I we that we I've

1430
04:34:41,560 --> 04:34:48,630
reached out yeah I got a guy working on it we'll see probably not though don't

1431
04:34:48,630 --> 04:34:58,150
get your hopes up okay if I do if I ended up ever getting the rights to

1432
04:34:58,150 --> 04:35:01,750
actually broadcast that on stream you do understand that to be able to do that I

1433
04:35:01,750 --> 04:35:05,189
probably have to sign an agreement that means I cannot I probably can't like say

1434
04:35:05,189 --> 04:35:10,599
like dog shit on stream anymore that would have to be a very I think family

1435
04:35:10,599 --> 04:35:13,959
friendly stream if I was given the rights by whatever group owns it to

1436
04:35:13,959 --> 04:35:23,400
distribute it on when watch it on stream okay we're back and I'm back to this

1437
04:35:23,400 --> 04:35:38,529
bridge will stay but wait sorry whatever I'll see you guys tomorrow I got a new

1438
04:35:38,529 --> 04:35:51,360
cave but now yeah that's it that's it we'll see you tomorrow signed off it's

1439
04:35:51,360 --> 04:35:57,259
still playing no no no no I got my fun out of it I have my fun in Pikmin so the

1440
04:35:57,259 --> 04:36:00,779
amount of times that I said I hate this controller versus this was a really fun

1441
04:36:00,779 --> 04:36:08,779
game that was a cool thing I just saw what's the ratio there four to one five

1442
04:36:08,779 --> 04:36:17,060
to one it's at least like five to one right I give Pikmin to a 76 and then in

1443
04:36:17,060 --> 04:36:32,959

1451
04:37:25,459 --> 04:37:32,419
2 I now have access to a Wii U so if there's something that is worth playing

1452
04:37:32,419 --> 04:37:37,139
on the Wii U and I do have it and I don't think I've ever really streamed

1453
04:37:37,139 --> 04:37:43,459
anything on the Wii U I did a bunch of Wii stuff but I don't think I've ever

1454
04:37:43,459 --> 04:37:53,340
really done a Wii U game do Pikmin 3 I don't know it's a literally only Pikmin

1455
04:37:53,340 --> 04:38:03,169
3 is the only one we'll see I'll give it a look all right here come the subs

1456
04:38:03,169 --> 04:38:12,819
thanks everybody it's insane how many people have subbed to this channel still

1457
04:38:12,819 --> 04:38:17,180
I don't I sometimes I just I just wonder why stare at the ceiling and I'm like

1458
04:38:17,180 --> 04:38:19,659
how can this many people want to give me five dollars a month I don't understand

1459
04:38:19,819 --> 04:38:28,029
but thanks I really appreciate it nonetheless it's a Plants vs. Zombies HD

1460
04:38:28,029 --> 04:38:41,459
they really kind of ruined that franchise didn't they that's weird that

1461
04:38:41,459 --> 04:38:46,790
went completely 180 real quickly didn't it I went from one of them was most

1462
04:38:46,790 --> 04:38:54,549
beloved everyone at PAX has the funny mask on and the cone on their head to

1463
04:38:54,549 --> 04:39:00,779
this is the most disgusting awful shitty game shitty practice ever by a company

1464
04:39:00,779 --> 04:39:06,639
ever and no one cares about pick I was at portal to Pikmin 2 what plans for

1465
04:39:06,639 --> 04:39:15,080
zombies 2 if you want to see a total 180 of community engagement versus

1466
04:39:15,080 --> 04:39:20,209
hatred of an entire franchise look no further than plants for a zombie 2 I

1467
04:39:20,209 --> 04:39:28,580
remember playing plants for zombies 2 and I was my base melted off

1468
04:39:28,580 --> 04:39:31,700
essentially with how I could not understand and I was just flabbergasted

1469
04:39:31,700 --> 04:39:37,669
what you needed to pay fucking money to like do well in that game that's all I

1470
04:39:37,669 --> 04:39:44,599
remembered I remember it was I got like 20 30 levels in or something oh this is

1471
04:39:44,599 --> 04:39:48,360
kind of fun but then it was like you like you're getting overwhelmed unless

1472
04:39:48,360 --> 04:39:53,279
you like use the super electrocution devices and stuff so what ended up

1473
04:39:53,279 --> 04:39:56,880
happening is I just ended up having a bunch of the electrocution like super

1474
04:39:56,880 --> 04:39:59,720
killed all that just wiped the screen things and I didn't play the game

1475
04:39:59,720 --> 04:40:04,770
anymore I just opened a level waited for enough stuff was to be loaded onto the

1476
04:40:04,770 --> 04:40:10,240
screen and then kill everything with the electricity I didn't even play the game

1477
04:40:10,240 --> 04:40:15,639
it was horrendous that was one of the worst games I've ever played and I'd

1478
04:40:15,639 --> 04:40:18,040
really mean that that was like one of the most that was one of the stupidest

1479
04:40:18,040 --> 04:40:25,990
things I've ever played I've ever played it's insane how bad they fucked up that

1480
04:40:25,990 --> 04:40:29,470
first game is unironically fantastic oh yeah well a lot of the pop cap stuff

1481
04:40:29,470 --> 04:40:37,720
was unironically fantastic it was just egregious horrendous business practices

1482
04:40:37,720 --> 04:40:44,119
and notice how you did they even talk about plans for zombies they have that

1483
04:40:44,119 --> 04:40:49,400
garden warfare game but I'll be honest I don't I don't care at all about that I

1484
04:40:49,400 --> 04:40:53,400
doesn't I wanted like a plans for zombies 2 or plans for zombies 3 or

1485
04:40:53,400 --> 04:40:57,919
something I've actually heard that it's not bad I've heard that garden warfare

1486
04:40:57,919 --> 04:41:04,470
is actually pretty fun that's to me to me that's the that's the side series

1487
04:41:04,470 --> 04:41:08,430
right that's the that's not the main series they've got plans for zombies

1488
04:41:08,430 --> 04:41:11,790
plans for zombies 2 plans for somebody's garden warfare cool it's a really kind

1489
04:41:11,790 --> 04:41:15,189
of fun an FPS game go check it out maybe but I want it I want like a main
