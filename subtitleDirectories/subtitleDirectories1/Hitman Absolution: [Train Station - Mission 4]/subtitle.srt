1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,570
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,570
This is the remaining footage I had before the holiday rush, which is why you haven't seen very much Hitman on this channel lately.

3
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,570
And I want to tell you what I'm planning on doing with this series.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,809
To make this go a little faster and a little more smoothly, I'm going to livestream the rest of this game.

5
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,810
You will know there will be plenty of announcements. I'll put it on Twitter and on my Steam group, on YouTube.

6
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,810
There will be an announcement saying I'm streaming Hitman.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:43,810
And what I'm going to do with that footage, the footage that I get from the livestream, is going to come over here in full unedited onto YouTube.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:51,810
So you might see an episode of Hitman Absolution that is like an hour and 45 minutes long, but it will be like five or six missions in a row.

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,810
And I feel like that's a better way to do this, because a lot of you guys want to see episodes more frequently, and I feel like this is the best way to do it.

10
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:05,810
So rather than have you guys have to wait like four or five days for another 15 minute episode, I can throw up a super episode.

11
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,810
And then you guys can dictate when you want to watch it, how long you want to watch it, do you want to watch like 20 minutes of it here,

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,810
and then wait like till later tonight, later tomorrow, whatever, to watch the rest of it.

13
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,810
I can dictate that up to you guys. And there will be no ads during the middle of it.

14
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,810
There's just going to be one ad in the beginning and one ad in the end.

15
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,810
I'm not going to throw like 10 ads in the middle of the video, so don't worry about that.

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,810
I just feel like this is a better way for me to be able to get this series out to you guys quicker.

17
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,049
And as always, please let me know what you think in the comments section if you like this idea.

18
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,049
And I'm going to let the live commentary play out now.

19
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:41,049
This is, like I said, just the tail end of the last remaining footage I had before I decided to do this change.

20
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,049
So I'll see you guys all soon. Take care, everybody, and enjoy the show.

21
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:56,250
Are they going to run away or what? Go secure the top floor like you were just asked to.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:13,580
Let's go out here and make it out of the crowd. Oh, I'm in the crowd, baby.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:22,050
Stand still to hide in the crowd. All right. Use control to see the crowd that's hiding you.

24
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, it's this crowd. Okay. Let's keep going. Where's the exit over here?

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,180
Walk my way over through this crowd. I'm standing this one.

26
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Police officer over there. I think I can make it to this one, maybe. That's going to be tough.

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,909
Hey, guys, how are you? We're all waiting for the train together. That's a fast train.

28
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,979
That thing just went 5,000 miles per hour over here.

29
00:02:53,979 --> 00:03:11,539
Let me play the video game. That's good. There's a cop over there.

30
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,740
That's all right. And there's a cop over on that side.

31
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:33,689
Got to go up. How am I supposed to go up? I can go in here, but there's a cop in here.

32
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:44,500
Is something going to happen here? Is this guy going to come out?

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,550
What does that say? What does that say? I want to see what it says.

34
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,550
This might provide a safe access to the control room.

35
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:02,270
You tell me all these people aren't going to see me do this? That's kind of suspicious.

36
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,900
Holy...

37
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,650
Right.

38
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,599
I'll pass the window for one second here.

39
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:21,160
Get in. A ladder right there. Let's make it out.

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:35,819
Climb the ladder. Another checkpoint. Perfect.

41
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:49,040
Checkpoint. Got to activate this train. Let's do it. He's busy.

42
00:04:49,040 --> 00:05:01,670
Objective complete. Go to platform B and wait for the next train. Let's do it, then.

43
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,379
Ooh, hold on, hold on, hold on. There's a dude right here.

44
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:14,220
Is he going to come in this room? Wow. No, he's just hanging out over there. I should be fine.

45
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:21,540
Don't want to go that way. Let's head back out the way I came in.

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:30,149
Keep off tracks. Electric current. You will die.

47
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:35,379
Nobody there. All right, I'm back.

48
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,379
Hi, people. Looks like blending in with the crowd.

49
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,139
Wait a minute. I got to go over on that side.

50
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:50,610
How do I get over there? Is there a way to get over there?

51
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,610
There has to be a way to get over there from over here, maybe. I don't know.

52
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,980
I probably should have stayed up there.

53
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:01,889
Let's just check over here first to make sure.

54
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,579
There's not a way to go over there.

55
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:10,079
I'm not seeing any points of interest.

56
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:16,259
I wonder if I can just walk by these officers.

57
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,259
It's going to be risky, but I can try it.

58
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,259
I got a checkpoint up there in case this goes wrong.

59
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,920
Let's go for it.

60
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Hey, how are you, officer? There's another one right here, too.

61
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,779
Oh, boy. This ain't going to work.

62
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,779
Oh, this ain't going to work. Oh, this ain't going to work.

63
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:43,120
Wow.

64
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,029
I'm standing in the crowd.

65
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,360
One cop there. I don't have any instinct left.

66
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
This is going to be difficult.

67
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,970
That guy's not paying attention. Neither is this guy.

68
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,189
So let's keep moving.

69
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,189
I wonder if I can just play this game and this guy won't do anything.

70
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,009
Let's see.

71
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,009
Perfect. I'm covered in mud.

72
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:16,319
Get out of here, man.

73
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,350
All right, turn. Let's go.

74
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,180
Oh, this guy's coming back this way now.

75
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,860
This guy's coming back. This guy's coming back.

76
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,620
Made it.

77
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,220
Beautiful. Beautiful.

78
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,220
Platform B is under close surveillance. Timing is crucial.

79
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,490
Good to know. So where's that train?

80
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,009
Where is that freaking train?

81
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,259
Waiting for the train.

82
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:02,740
Do I have to go down there for the train to come?

83
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,180
Where's the train? Come on, train. Let's go.

84
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,939
I don't got all day.

85
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,079
I'm going to have to do it.

86
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:21,649
Right when these two turn.

87
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,649
When these two guys turn around, I'm going down there.

88
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,980
This is going to be really hard.

89
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,689
Holy crap.

90
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:33,629
Time to go.

91
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:39,330
Time to go. Time to go.

92
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,330
The train will arrive in 60 seconds.

93
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,230
60 seconds. I got to wait here.

94
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,230
Oh, this is going to be so hard.

95
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,730
This is going to be so hard.

96
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,950
Oh, man. Come on, train. Let's go.

97
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,299
45 seconds.

98
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:02,779
I'm going to make this a little bit more difficult.

99
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,519
I'm going to get in this crowd right here.

100
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,509
Come on. 30 seconds. Come on.

101
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:16,669
Come on, train.

102
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:22,049
Come on, train.

103
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,269
This is okay. This is okay.

104
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:28,960
Cops are nowhere to be found.

105
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
I can just chill out. Perfect.

106
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,039
15 seconds.

107
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,039
Start the countdown. Come on. Let's go, train.

108
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,909
Nope. Nobody coming.

109
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,909
Oh, I'm out of here. I'm in the clear right now, guys.

110
00:09:44,909 --> 00:09:49,460
This is it. Beautiful.

111
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,909
Get that train in here.

112
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:58,100
Oh, boy. He's coming back. Crap.

113
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,659
Come on. Before this guy gets over here, let's go.

114
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,580
Get on the train.

115
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
What? What? What?

116
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,700
Oh, boy.

117
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,009
Hello.

118
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,009
How are you? Let me just get in the train.

119
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,940
I'm just getting

120
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
in the train. Oh, no.

121
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,779
Let me in the train.

122
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,210
Let me in the train. Open the doors.

123
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:32,350
I made it in the train. I made it in the train.

124
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,590
Yes.

125
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,940
All righty. Here it is,

126
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,759
ladies and gentlemen. That was a

127
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,759
long mission. That took a long time.

128
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,279
I only had one restart.

129
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
Dual welding expertise, cool.

130
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Pure instinct, cool.

131
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,299
Hand-to-hand, cool.

132
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,820
Okay, let's take a look here. Burning Hotel, the library,

133
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Xing Riya train station.

134
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,500
35,000 points.

135
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,679
This one, this

136
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,679
Xing Riya one got screwed up.

137
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,679
Because I had to kill like five people.

138
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,679
Well, actually one person, but you know, you get the idea.
