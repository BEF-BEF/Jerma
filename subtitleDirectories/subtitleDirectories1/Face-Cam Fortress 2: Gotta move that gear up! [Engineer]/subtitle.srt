00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:20,420
Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing on Gullywash with the Frontier Justice, the Mini Sentry, and the Pistol.

2
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:26,390
The D-whoa! Hi Heavy! I can't believe you didn't kill me.

3
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,390
Gullywash is a map that I don't normally play on, and it's not because I don't like the map, it's because you don't really see it in the server browser too often.

4
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,020
But it's a five control point map, it's pretty interesting, and we are getting pretty much rolled right now.

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:51,159
Oh, get planted! Get pla-what? How did I-come here! Get over here! Oh! Give me that! Yeah! Yeah!

6
00:00:51,159 --> 00:01:06,650
Oh, I was so pumped up right there, I almost just got like, aww, is this milk? It's milk! It's not Dr. Papa. What magician put that in front of me?

7
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:17,629
Milk is good though, I suggest you drink it. If you do not drink milk, does the body good? It's good to have every so often. I drink it usually once a day, maybe give or take.

8
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:23,629
Why am I not putting down-I should have put down my own stuff right there. I'm sitting there waiting for a teleporter and I'm an engineer.

9
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:29,879
Let's go for some more punches. Get that thing out of here!

10
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:43,450
Getting kills, getting kills, getting kills. Come on. Give me some more kills. Nice. Mini Sentry for the win, hell yeah. Hell freaking yeah.

11
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:50,840
That means if it dies, I'm gonna get the mini-I thought the mini-I almost said mini crits. Full crits, baby. What are you talking about, Jerma?

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:59,540
I still didn't put-I'm putting Dispenser in here. Forget that. Dispenser is going up in this room.

13
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,019
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Let's see what's out here.

14
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:15,979
We're still pushed back here? We're gonna move up. No, no, you good? Now I'm gonna do it. Here we go, baby. Let's plant it on some more people. Get some-oh!

15
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:32,750
Come on, come out here, Pyro. Come here. Come here, you. Come here, you. I didn't kill that guy. Bananas. Oh, that guy's got crits!

16
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,889
And a Pyro! Noooo!

17
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:49,719
Damn it. All right, I'm gonna build that guy's-oh, I am so stupid. I've had an opportunity to build that guy's teleporter up and I haven't done it yet.

18
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:59,460
I need to drink some more milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk. All right, here you go.

19
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,599
Now that it's there, it has level three. I'm gonna build one, too. Don't worry. So we're gonna have two there.

20
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:16,580
Jerma, being a bad engineer. Let's just go. Gotta get out the front lines. They are going to cap this, or are they?

21
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:26,789
Good, I'll take that. I'll take that. Get mine up here so we can get more people at the front lines, baby.

22
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:33,000
What the hell is going on? What? What just happened?

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,560
Scare. Nice, like, scary ghost heavy jumping around the corner.

24
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,620
Damn. I gotta put my game face on here, guys, because they're gonna cap this right now, probably.

25
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:51,150
Get your game face on. Or build up at the last point because they're coming in.

26
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,539
No, Pyro's gonna cap it if we're not careful. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? You son of a bitch.

27
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:09,830
Oh my god, it's the same heavy! Dude, that heavy has popped around a corner and, like, boo, scared me and killed me, like, three times in a row now.

28
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,830
And that's gonna be it! Somebody get on the-

29
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:23,689
Oh well. I wanna watch that back. I wanna see that heavy jump around the corner and, like, spoke me.

30
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:31,790
Get that built. Teams just scrambled, so that's a good thing, I think.

31
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,360
Maybe not. Maybe it scrambled in the same teams. Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!

32
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:48,870
Got my teleporter. This is gonna be my last run here, this last life. I'm gonna give myself one more life.

33
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:55,110
And we'll see if I can't pull something out here and not just die 50,000 times. Hey, are you a real spy? Yes, you are.

34
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:05,800
Yes, you are. This one's gonna go over here. Right over this corner. Right, no, right here.

35
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,379
Gotta watch that back area. That's a bad place to be.

36
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:18,790
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

37
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:26,810
Let's go, Jag! You gotta shine here, Jag. Get that spy too! Woohoo!

38
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:36,660
This is what I'm talking about. Oh no! Oh no! Uber, Uber and a scout. I can't do much right here. I gotta wait till that's gone.

39
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,310
No, no, get it up, get it up, come on, come on, get it up!

40
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,600
I don't care if it goes down. It's worth it. Nice. Nice job

41
00:05:48,399 --> 00:06:01,899
Keep them off on here. Don't want to completely run out of metal here. You are a scout a real one

42
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:17,220
Making bacon teams pushing up. I think I think so moving up. Do I dare move this is the question here

43
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:24,939
You get some full metal. I'm moving up. I'm gonna do it. I had this my last life

44
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:25,600
I'm gonna do it

45
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,420
You know if I get myself killed I get myself killed but I'm going for like this room right in here

46
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:41,589
Like right here. This is probably a really bad spot, but it's all good. We got we got a capped

47
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:47,550
We got a capped move it up. Oh boy. Oh boy. Come on. Get it up. Get it up

48
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,000
Get it up before this guy comes around the corner. We're good

49
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,879
Oh

50
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:01,439
Wish I had the Wrangler cuz that's not close enough one century man. This thing has been alive

51
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:15,089
I can't believe no one's taking this thing down and push up damn. Oh man. I need it

52
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:23,439
You know, where's the teleporter exit right there? Go hurry get out of here. Oh, no

53
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:32,660
Let's move this thing up again. Let's move it like into like right here when they turn this corner

54
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:40,740
It is going to unload on these guys. There we go. I got the backup here. I get the backup

55
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:49,610
You know what? I gotta destroy this and I don't have enough metal, but I'm gonna build a dispenser up here for the crew

56
00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:00,579
Where's the metal? There it is. Go go go jump up

57
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:08,790
Well, this one life has lasted fairly long time. Don't worry when he walks out this door watch this. Hey heavy

58
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh

59
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,790

Bastard. Oh, I gotta pick this up. I was lucky

62
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:36,659
This thing has stayed alive since so many times when it should go down. It's just a complete stalemate

63
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:48,080
Hey scout, you're not gonna get this buddy. I'll plant it on you and I got a century kill. Hell

64
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,379
Yeah, and I lived longer this one life that I said I was doing one life than the whole damn time
