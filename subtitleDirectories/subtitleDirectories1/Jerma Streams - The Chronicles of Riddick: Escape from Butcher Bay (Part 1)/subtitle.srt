00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:18,660
Good morning, what's up? Welcome to another stream. Today, we're gonna play the Chronicles of Riddick

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,890
Assault on Dark Athena. But actually, it's the Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher's Bay,

3
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:34,700
which is Assault on Dark Athena, is the game. It's a remake of Butcher's Bay that added a

4
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:45,369
campaign on top. Some weird development issues happened. This game is a remake of the last game

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:57,990
with a small campaign added on top, so we're playing the remake. This is bullshit. Dark Athena

6
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:05,689
is the sequel. Dark Athena is the sequel, but it has a remade Butcher's Bay in it. Go look it up.

7
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:10,569
There's some, there's a lot of things with how assets were being sold during, I believe, was it

8
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:15,290
was a THQ? I don't want to make this up. Let's see. I think it was something to do with that,

9
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:22,939
right? Saw waiting room? Well, don't worry. Saw 2 is going to be really soon. Uh, yeah, we're

10
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:29,799
gonna play. I have a confession to make though. I have never seen any of the Riddick movies at all.

11
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,040
I have no idea what this is. I don't know. All I know is that the character wears sunglasses. I

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,239
have no idea what's going on. I remember watching the trailer list for this movie back in the day.

13
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,780
There's like four of them or three of them or something and it's, and they were pretty

14
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:51,560
people liked them. From my understanding, this game is not just a movie game. This is a completely

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,680
new campaign that Vin Diesel himself oversaw. Am I getting that right? So this is not just a

16
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:08,729
movie tie-in. Vin Diesel made this game. Like he made it happen. He's in it. He voices it. He

17
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,810
wrote all the dialogue and he programmed all the encounters. So can we give it up for Vin Diesel

18
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:33,479
for just a moment, please? All right. Are you guys ready? I'm, I'm ready to go. I've been ready for

19
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:39,580
about 25 minutes. It just, I have no references to make for the Chronicles of Riddick. So making a

20
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,879
title was impossible. So I just reached into the YouTuber handbook and I got a good one.

21
00:02:45,879 --> 00:03:04,120
Okay. Here we go. This is Escape from Butcher's Bay, but it's Dark Athena. See? See? See, I told

22
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:17,080
you. There were people in chat going, you idiot. Oh, who's the idiot? Huh? It ain't me. Literally,

23
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,069
no one did that. I'm making up somebody to be angry at. No one did that. Not one person. I'm

24
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,030
just making everybody think that there's some, some person in the chat room that I'm angry at.

25
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,159
This did not happen. I just want to make sure that's pretty clear. All right, let's go. This

26
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:52,900
is from 2004, by the way. Oh, we got to test the audio. One, two. We synced up. Sounds good to me.

27
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:12,469
Slightly off. It's delayed. My voice is early. Hold on. This is really important to do this.

28
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:16,180
Otherwise it's going to be fucked up the whole stream. All right, hold on.

29
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:36,569
One, one, two. Here we go. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

30
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:52,519
One, two. Butcher's Bay. I'm going to play on normal. I don't want to fuck this up. 2004 hard,

31
00:04:52,519 --> 00:05:05,769
guys, is not the same as 2020 hard. 2004 hard is you get shot once and die. I'm not doing it.

32
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:14,579
No, this is 2004. This is Escape from Butcher's Bay. What even is this bit? What bit? I'm picking

33
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:27,579
a difficulty. I don't understand this joke. I mean, what, what is this? Is this like pick a door and

34
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:34,629
one of the doors is going to have like something funny behind it? Difficulty bit. All right. I'm

35
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:38,310
going to just pick normal. I don't care. Make fun of me. You can make fun of me all stream if you

36
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:58,019
want. All right. It's already done. It's that's too late. I can't go back. All right. Quiet. We're

37
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:07,850
moving again. They just transmitted a safe route through the minefield. You think Huxley's memory

38
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,250
is that Hannibal Lecter? What's going on? Look at you, Riddick and all is forgiven.

39
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:21,220
And I think you're bounding plus 50 plus 50. Greed is an ugly thing. You're in no position to

40
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:35,540
negotiate, Riddick. I'm excited. This is a very highly requested game. I'm excited to play this

41
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,300
one. Oh yeah. I forgot you don't like this part. Statistically landings are the most dangerous.

42
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,300
You got nothing left to live for, Riddick. I do. I shut up with you. You're already counting it,

43
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,939
aren't you? I said shut up. I feel like he could just like duck down and slip out of this.

44
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:16,779
He could just go underneath the bottom bar. All right. Here we go. One person. You're right. One

45
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:22,139
person requested this game. They're going to be really happy. Hey, hold it. You go where I say

46
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:37,910
when I say. What happened? Oh, this game sucks though. You don't know that. Who told you that?

47
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:45,420
You know, how do you have any idea? Walk up to a character and press Y to initiate dialogue mode.

48
00:07:45,420 --> 00:08:10,819
Press Y to speak after selecting your response. Why did that happen? Did I game too hard?

49
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:19,240
Okay. Walk up and initiate conversation. Hey, don't fucking move. What about the guy behind

50
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,300
you? He's moving. Johns know he should cool down. Scare Johns about being ripped off. Scare him.

51
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:35,750
Today, Johns, you get fucked. You don't move until I say so. Hey, hey, hold it. You go where I say

52
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,990
when I say. He just stepped on his head. I just wanted to look around. Wait, am I not supposed to

53
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:56,360
move? Why? It's because I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why. I know why.

54
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,850
This is kind of loose. That's not good. I got to tape this. I don't know about you guys,

55
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,730
but seriously, I'm like a fucking animal when I have a controller and I have to tap a button.

56
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:11,850
When I tap right trigger, I'm actually pressing every button and I'm squeezing really hard.

57
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,220
The thing that's holding the battery on is going to fall off. Don't fucking move.

58
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:29,580
Today, Johns, you get fucked. You don't move until I say so. Hey, hey, hold it. You go where I say

59
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,299
when I say. I just wanted to look around. This is red light, green light.

60
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:48,309
Yeah. Wait, what? You didn't hear me? How do you not hear him? Info, sneak up behind Johns and

61
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:54,309
grab him by pressing left trigger to silently break his neck. You can also perform a faster

62
00:09:54,309 --> 00:10:03,340
but louder neck break by pressing right trigger. Break his neck. I don't want to. Why don't you do

63
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:20,919
it? Oh, it should break his neck. DNA protection learns the hard way. We should get moving.

64
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:36,870
How do I get in? Where am I? Get in. Get in here quick. Oh shit, I got fucking killed.

65
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:50,059
What? Jump. It goes into third person. That's awesome. Oh, and you got a Dark Souls drag

66
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:57,190
down. Are you kidding me? Cigarettes. That's a pat. Yep. Extra content. Butcher Bay is now

67
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:06,169
available in the extra content menu. I think it's too dark. Did I make the brightness a little bit

68
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:21,269
higher? I'm not a boss. How? Make it a little bit higher. A little bit higher. 55. It's a little

69
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:34,440
better, I think. OK, so now now what do we do? Inmate on the run. Wait, you can fight hand to

70
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,679
hand with enemies. Press RT to punch and LT to block. Try to move in different directions and

71
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:59,990
punch at the same time to perform different strikes. Unauthorized. My god. OK, I think he's

72
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:07,639
dead. How can you be unauthorized to pick up a gun? I don't understand. Oh, security card.

73
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:21,480
They just showed you that they're locked. Yeah, well, I'm what do you want to do? They already

74
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,639
explained it. Yeah, but I someone said my controller was like falling out and I was I'm trying to be

75
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:39,639
very, very careful with the controller right now. Anything over here? No. On stealth mode,

76
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,480
press X for stealth. You sneak silently. A blue screen effect indicates that no one can see you.

77
00:12:46,120 --> 00:13:04,620
Well, he can't see me. It's just me in the shower, man. Drop him. Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:16,629
Hide the body. It's completely dark. Hold the left bumper down and move left, right or forward

79
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:26,330
and lean in that direction. Releasing you will lean, do lean mode. Drag a body, stand close to

80
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:37,019
the body and press Y. Press Y again. You must be in stealth mode to do this. OK, there are probably

81
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,460
other guards around. Hide this body in the dark or his friends will be alerted when they find him.

82
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:52,100
It's like Hitman. Wait, me being invisible, does that make him invisible too? What am I supposed to

83
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:12,360
do with this guy? Air. Maybe a vent. Throw him in the vent? Leave him in the dark. To climb up

84
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:20,500
something, press Y. OK, well, I'll leave him over here. This is dark. You can tell when it's dark

85
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:36,740
because it gets blue. Yeah, he's good. The third person is, I love that. It's so funny. My games

86
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:47,100
stopped doing that, didn't they? How do I climb up? Use a hang rail. Look at it and press Y or

87
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,549
jump onto it for pressing A. There's a hang rail above you. Drop him a hang rail, press Y. OK.

88
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:58,250
Hang rail. What else you got? You can drop down on enemies that are far below to kill them and

89
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:05,100
break your fall to your best. That's so clumsy. I thought it was going to be like,

90
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,340
use your intuition to throw a batarang. No, no, no, no. Just fall on people and kill them.

91
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:51,830
I mean, I can't even see. All right, I got to hide this guy. OK, we're good. I mean, it's very,

92
00:15:51,830 --> 00:16:02,980
you're going to obviously see that, dude, but whatever. Scan my eyes. What does he want me to

93
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:18,200
do now? Can I open this door? On the vent? He came out of here, right? Have something on you?

94
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:36,279
You like a key card? Let's climb it again. I'm sorry. This whole game looks like this,

95
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:52,789
like a layer of cooking oil put on it. PS3. No, no, no, no. You got it wrong. You got it wrong.

96
00:16:52,789 --> 00:17:04,440
This is the Xbox 360. It's a much better console than PS3. No, shut up. PS3 is better. No, idiot.

97
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:21,690
Rating. Med station. Takes away the hurt, leaves the pain. It's like Half-Life style med stations.

98
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,299
I don't feel like I'm really small. This nano med health unit is empty. In order to refill it,

99
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,299
you need to find a refill cartridge and then replace the empty one in the nano med unit by

100
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:45,059
pressing Y. OK, what do I have? Two chunks. You can use this refill cartridge to restore an empty

101
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:58,700
nano med health unit. That's why it doesn't do the Half-Life sounds. I wouldn't want to use this.

102
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:06,299
Don't you think you'd like to have like a bruised elbow? Don't you think you just want to let it

103
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:13,960
heal in like a few days? All right, does this thing? OK, that's ready to go. That's horrifying.

104
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:26,660
All right, we got to be ready. We got to lean. Disarm our guard. Press right trigger when he

105
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:43,190
tries to hit you. It was a parry? Just take the gun. Got it. Shoot. Wow, you have a gun with no

106
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:51,690
bullets? What the hell are you doing? Is this just for show? Hold down right bumper and move around

107
00:18:51,690 --> 00:19:01,700
to select a weapon. Oh, he did. No, that's a pack of cigarettes. He's got too many bullets.

108
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:17,059
Tools? He was on break? So? All right, let's go. Dude, I don't care if somebody finds him.

109
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:23,990
What does that even matter? While hanging, you can move sideways. Oh, no, somebody's going to

110
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:40,069
find him. I don't care. What are Riddick's superpowers? Press right stick to initiate

111
00:19:40,069 --> 00:19:55,220
weapon melee attack. Oh, he's cool. Oh, he can see in the dark. All right.

112
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:18,460
OK, there's one. Is there only one there? Let's see. There's one. This guy's just talking about

113
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,980
how bad his day was. Just the same shit that I do when I'm in like a car and there's nobody with me.

114
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:42,470
I just like go off. Go off, dude. Let's see it. Let's do that forever. No, break his neck. Break

115
00:20:42,470 --> 00:21:03,769
his neck. Put this gun away. Break his neck. Left trigger. Good. He's talking about this guy. All

116
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:10,069
right. I've gotten right. Oh, there's 47 bullets now. We went from zero to this guy has way too

117
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:42,950
many. Let's go on the sewers. Where's the way down? Sewers. Jump down. Cool. Oh, the gunplay. Oh,

118
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:56,579
the gunplay. You know what I mean? It's actually kind of terrible. Well, not my favorite. Do you

119
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:03,859
have a flashlight for those of us that can't see in the dark, Riddick? Yes, you do. Thank you. The

120
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:13,319
flashlight attached to shotguns can be used by person. Well, why does he need this? What are you

121
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:38,599
doing down here? OK, sewer guards. We got to make sure we guard the sewers. Wait, did I shoot him

122
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:56,460
or did he hit his head on the ceiling jumping? I don't know. Is he dead? Yeah, you do. You've got

123
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:10,579
to turn the flashlight off. Don't worry. He'll eventually turn this corner. That's Jake the dog.

124
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:40,700
Yes, it is. Wait. Shit. He turned the light on when he killed me. Why did I die instantly?

125
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,609
I was trying to put the body right next to him. How did I die instantly? I don't understand.

126
00:23:45,609 --> 00:24:06,980
He killed me instantly. I had four health blocks. What did he say? I'm going to die, dude. This is

127
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:19,259
game. OK, something else exploded. Why is it dying right down here? I don't remember this happening

128
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:31,380
in the movies. All right. I'm fucking going for it now. I'm not going to fuck around. I need to see.

129
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:49,930
All right. I don't care if the game's about not seeing. Oh, my God. Are they dead? Wait, what is

130
00:24:49,930 --> 00:25:03,339
that? I just got. What did I pick up? Like a hologram? How do you reload? You know, I can't

131
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:10,700
think of something in a more stupid idea than to put exploding fucking barrels down under the

132
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:36,390
gas lines of the town. Rising. Oh, yeah. Hey, boss, where should we put the sixth exploding barrel?

133
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:43,750
I don't know. Put it over the corner. I was asleep the whole time.

134
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,700
I'll act like you're asleep. You're going to be some money.

135
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,049
Is this like the evil asshole final enemy?

136
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,970
They already did this. Now play nice so we can get this over with quickly.

137
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,079
It's already over, John. Secure your weapon, Johns.

138
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:28,440
Good to see you too, warden. So the famous Mr. Riddick. The Hawks. Finally come to stay.

139
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:29,640
Is this a prison?

140
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,440
Vin Diesel does this thing where he like purr talks. He's like purring like a kitten.

141
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,329
Right, Hoxie? I think Riddick about covers what you owe me, Johns.

142
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,009
There's plenty other slams I can take Riddick to if you can't afford. Vin Diesel should play

143
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:19,450
a cool cat in an animated movie. All right. All right. Can't you see him? Cool cat with sunglasses

144
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:25,609
on. Extra. No, Riddick stays at Butcher Bay. Period. Full stop. Let's get him processed.

145
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:37,880
Yes, sir. I like that one. Johns. Better luck next time. Okay, so we're doing this again.

146
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:50,819
Pay attention, punk. You are now Butcher Bay prisoner 542. As to remember your number.

147
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:59,589
Can he just run? Oh, come on. Listen, outside. I feel like this is what the new Star Wars

148
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:03,109
experience at Disney World is going to be like. Oh, it's me. I'm the prisoner.

149
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,380
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where are we going? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Lock me up. Oh, wow. Look.

150
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:18,569
Hey, I better be. I better watch out for those guards, right?

151
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:26,730
Just wait till they start doing this shit. I can't wait for that, by the way, that like Star Wars

152
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:31,049
experience where like you get like arrested and you have to like fight Kylo Ren. That's like a

153
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:55,430
$4,000 experience that I'm absolutely going to have. Look at that. Look at that actor.

154
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:12,490
On his resume said he could spin guns and shit. This is I love this. Come on. Give me shit. I hear

155
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:27,430
a large crowd. Why do I hear a crowd? This is going to turn into Arkham Asylum, isn't it?

156
00:29:43,259 --> 00:30:01,900
That was a pretty sick walk. Hey, what are you bringing to me? Things his shit don't stick.

157
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:07,980
Well, I mean, I have been taking probiotics that's supposed to help with that. But whatever,

158
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,819
I won't correct it. Really? I'm barber. Come talk to me after the lousy. Okay.

159
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:22,259
This is your home. It's time for us to do lousy filthy ass. Don't breathe. And by the way,

160
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:29,099
the menu was on the table on the right. It's happy hour right now, by the way. Get in there,

161
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:53,539
scumbag. Oh, okay. Nobody likes the nobody likes the like Disney World experience restaurant. Oh,

162
00:30:53,539 --> 00:31:07,829
okay. Cleansing routines. Wait. Dignity of slam life. Let some mercs think they're in charge.

163
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:17,269
Oh, I have to put my hands in the toilet. What is it? Okay. Flush toilet is I open the menu.

164
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,789
Arbor outside your cell might help you locate the weak spot of this slam. Remember that security

165
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:37,319
will notice and take action if you have weapons. I was crouching that whole time. Okay, we're

166
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:43,000
going to get why is the door open? Hey, come talk to me for a second. Will you? I thought I was

167
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,890
supposed to be locked in here. You're really right. But it's a guy named medicine talking

168
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:54,250
like he knows you. He's in the courtyard just by the pit. Okay. Thanks a lot, dude.

169
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:15,079
Wait, did he do that? Uh, that's, I, you can't, I love games that let me do that.

170
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,480
You know that if your video game allows me, even if there's a stupid little cut scene where you

171
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,720
have to run away, if I could just punch a guy and get like in trouble for it, like that's,

172
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,240
I like that. That's good that they did that. A lot of games don't care. I don't know what

173
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,089
Maxin wants with you, but I go check it out. If I were you, I can't break his neck though. Right.

174
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,240
All right. I promise I'm done. I'm probably I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I just want to see if

175
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:49,960
I could break his neck. Cause you know, you do realize that if I could break his neck,

176
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,519
I would have ran around and broke everybody's neck and the whole fucking entire floor.

177
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,119
He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. He's just like, maybe if I don't look at him,

178
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:06,470
I feel like I have been unfriended. Okay. Who are you? It's the Kozak brother,

179
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,910
AKA the torture twins locked down yesterday. Managed to get hold of some poor side, obviously.

180
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:23,960
Okay. Hey, my advice, do like all the other fish line up. I can't, I have to,

181
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,119
I have to just take my hand off right trigger. I can't help it. You see this face,

182
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:39,579
all things to Molina waste him when they open his cell. Oh, I'll make it worth your while.

183
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:45,480
When they open his cell, what is he going to do for me though? I don't, I mean,

184
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,960
I'm not sure if I want to agree to this because this, this guy's going to be my companion or

185
00:33:49,960 --> 00:34:05,180
something. It looks like he gets his ass kicked all the time. Uh, yeah, I'll do it. Maybe. Okay.

186
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,840
What was the guy's name? What cell is his? Hey, what cell is Molina's.

187
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:18,070
You won't ever walk into the infirmary punk. Maybe we'll drag you in when rust is finished

188
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:29,539
with you. Now piss off. Okay. When they open his cell, kill him. All right. Now I gotta go,

189
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:36,250
I gotta do this way. This game's pretty cool. I, I had some of this game. I like this game. This

190
00:34:36,250 --> 00:35:00,070
is cool. All right. Let's go over here. Who's in here? All right. I'm the toilet guy. That's,

191
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:11,260
that's how people know me. That's how you'll remember me. Is it Arnold? All right. I gotta

192
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,539
find this, this, I gotta find this way to get out of here. Here we go. Yeah.

193
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:27,460
You didn't pay your damn long man in the first place. You got that right. You should see Haley.

194
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,619
He can help you out. You're going to get in trouble with the Aquila measures. I'll tell you.

195
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,500
Look, go on and talk to Haley. He's the wise man. He used to be a guard, but he turned over to the

196
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:52,739
good side. Okay. Everyone has a name. Oh, this Haley is red. I'm looking for the,

197
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:01,059
it looks like a way. We got a link here. There's some link spam here.

198
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:13,239
You're streaming the Chronicles of British ass. I mean, that's not that funny. That's not that

199
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:17,639
funny. If I'm, if I'm going to get a minus two for my Disney world restaurant bit, then that's a

200
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:29,000
minus two for like the word ass is in the title. Bugger. You got a problem, huh? Go fuck yourself.

201
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:34,619
I got him. I actually hit him. I didn't think that was even, nobody even saw.

202
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:53,429
Nobody saw me do that. Shit. Wait, they thought he did it. He did it. That guy did it. Take him

203
00:36:53,429 --> 00:37:09,429
back to his cell. Yeah. Come on, dude. Give it a rest. Oh, I'm about to impress everybody

204
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:29,030
at the prison right now. You ever seen anybody do that for your whole life? No. Oh yeah. No,

205
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:33,480
no, no. I mean, I heard you were coming. You're going to want to ship and I can get you one.

206
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:40,019
Check my bunk and you'll find one. It's yours. I want this guy fired for heaven.

207
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Trying to do a voice like mine. I'm the only one that has a low gravelly voice.

208
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:52,679
Get rid of that guy. What do you want me to do? What's, what's with the links today? Dick ass

209
00:37:52,679 --> 00:38:05,449
gameplay. Cool. Yeah. You cropped it. Listen, Riddick rust pulls all the strings in this block.

210
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,179
Personally, I don't much care for that. He's a thorn on my side.

211
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,289
Child humor. Remove the thorn, get rust. All right. So I have to,

212
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:31,460
you give me a list of people I have to. Wait, they electrocuted him and it electrocuted me.

213
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:42,280
I was standing on his body. I was a conductor. All right, let's go. Open it. Who did he say to

214
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:50,570
kill? Oh, and even listening. Yes, I was. Okay. Promise. Mattson promised he'd put a ship for you

215
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:57,690
in his bunk. Go to sell a 40 and get the ship. Don't give me a knife. Don't give me a knife.

216
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,969
Don't do that. I'll never get out of the tutorial. It's not going to happen. If you give it,

217
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:06,940
if I get a knife, I'm not going to be able to leave. Don't give me this in the toilet.

218
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,420
Hey, what? Oh, you guys want to fight. Do you, or is this like a dialogue thing?

219
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:26,250
No, what do you want to talk about? Uh, or I'll do it too. I'm new here and, uh,

220
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:56,420
I think they want to fight. Do they? I don't, maybe. Whoa, I just parried that guy. Okay. Okay.

221
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,260
Watch it. I'm going to flush him. I'm going to try to flush him.

222
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,510
He's too big. I can't flush him. All right. Where's the knife?

223
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:27,340
Supposed to be a knife in here. Oh no, he lied to me. There's no knife in here. He lied to me.

224
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,940
He said there was a knife in here. So I could come in and get beat up and potentially fucking

225
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:40,420
killed. Hmm. Mm hmm. Go see what he has to say about it. All right, let's go get him.

226
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:57,780
Where are you? Is that in the courtyard? Is there sprint? It's barber. That's Jimbo.

227
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:24,519
This is shabby. This is Michael's. Okay. Minus two joke, ignoring the link. I'm in the middle of

228
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:34,389
something. Where? No, not Jack. He's up here. He's the writer, isn't he? No, that's red.

229
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:47,030
Yeah. He let me explain. It was rust. He forced me to, but, but I knew those goons were no match

230
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:53,510
for you. I'll get you a shift. Just have things right. You have my word. I want it now. Cross me

231
00:41:53,510 --> 00:42:01,219
again and I'll have your life. Talk. I don't know anything. Not compared to Haley. This one guy's

232
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:09,239
just like, I'm going to hear everything. Used to be a guard. Let me set things straight. I'll bring

233
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,800
that shift to your cell. Just kill. Just go there and wait. Are there three guys here? This?

234
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,630
Yeah. Yeah. That's what's happening. Haley. It's all right. I got, I'm still going to do the thing

235
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:27,480
for you. Get rust and I'll help you. Go to your cell and wait for me. That'd not be lying to me.

236
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:36,940
Remember this is the last time. All right. I was the last link of this link. Cool down is going

237
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:44,599
into effect. After I clicked this, it's just Homer Simpson, like shoes is Homer Simpson, like mask,

238
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,000
sock feet things. Right. And that like the kiosk at the mall, they have like goofy

239
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:01,699
fucking slippers to put on. That's cool. I'll go back to my cell, which cell is mine. I don't

240
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:05,860
even remember. I don't know which cell is mine. This is a bad prison. If I don't even know where

241
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:11,860
I go, I don't know what cell is mine. I forget eight 34. This one. All right. Where is he?

242
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:22,699
I got the ship you wanted. Really? What do you think you're doing? You deal in without my

243
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:33,130
approval. You're in my cell. You need a blade. You come to me. I said my cell. What wrong?

244
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:38,730
All these cells belong to the Achilles. Include this one. Now you ain't paid me for that shank.

245
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:46,760
So it ain't yours. Come take it. You got a hearing problem. I said everything I see belongs to me.

246
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:53,880
I see this. It belongs to me. Release him, British.

247
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:13,429
Who's this? And I will personally bring hell down on you. Oh, it's one of the guards. Let's do

248
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:17,750
something like Tony Hawk create a character outfit. I thought you were the big dog, Russ.

249
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:30,199
Maybe he's more yourself. Yes, sir. Mr. Rabbit. Hey, that's my friend. You are messing with the

250
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,159
natural order. What did he just do? Why did blood come out of him? Well, as you can see,

251
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:40,659
people can get that was a ketchup packet that he spread on the wall. This is actors. I'm telling

252
00:44:40,659 --> 00:44:52,309
you. And we don't want that. Speak for yourself. This better not be one of your killing boys.

253
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,670
I've been here responding to not very good guard work. This is that we could have had like three

254
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,190
or four opportunities just to grab the gun out of his hand. Like, come on, you can't get that

255
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:18,630
close. All right. Get out of my get out of my wall. Get away from me.

256
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,820
Rust is waiting for you in the killers block. He won't stop till you're dead. So you better find

257
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:37,610
a weapon woman can help. Okay. I this is just go around and find the one person that's actually

258
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:46,699
going to help me. Okay. Get a weapon. I Haley won't talk to me unless I get rid of rust.

259
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:53,820
And then Molina seems to have messed up shabby up a real bad client and kill Molina. All right,

260
00:45:53,820 --> 00:46:26,119
let's just go to the I need a weapon. Oh, wait, what if he doubles the money? I don't know what

261
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:32,280
you're after. Okay. But Haley knows how things work here. Check the courtyard. Now he didn't say

262
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,800
like, wait, I'll double the money that you were going to get from that guy. No, sorry. You didn't

263
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:54,980
do the double the money meme. How do I do this without getting attention trope cliche? Yeah,

264
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:54,860
whatever. That gallop can pick his body up. Hey, hit him one more time. I didn't want to do it in

265
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:04,409
the open. Wait, is he gonna remember that? He crawled out of myself. He crawled in that much

266
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:10,869
time to hear somebody get this guy some medicine. Wait, is he going to be there? He's not going to

267
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:15,909
still be here, right? Does he remember that I did that? Does this game have like memories? What?

268
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:29,800
He's dead? All right, where's um, where's the guy that I have to turn this into?

269
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:41,739
Who who wanted me to do this? Oh, it was shabby. Oh, now Molina is gone. Go and get your Oh,

270
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:56,650
all right. What's up? Thanks for wasting Molina. This is for you. What is it? What is it? You didn't

271
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:02,219
give me anything. What did it mean? This is for you. You didn't give me anything. Thanks for wasting

272
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:11,829
Molina man. See, wait, the unofficial and universal currency. You currently have five UD secret code.

273
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:17,050
This is a four digit security code. It opens a locked door somewhere probably inside the infirmary.

274
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:32,039
All right. Take care. Thanks, dude. All right, now let's go into the yard here. I'm gonna laugh my

275
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:40,039
ass off if in like 40 minutes this guy's up here on the ground still. Russ will kill you unless

276
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:56,360
you join him. I'd like to see him try Jimbo. I'd like to see him try a new fish in the tank.

277
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:06,489
How do you like it here? I don't. Name's red. Tell me. How did it feel when you killed your

278
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:11,610
first? Oh, you mean Molina? That's between me and him in butcher bay. You know, I did kind of was

279
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:20,889
some men can get very much pleasure. You know, there are worse reasons. Some like rust. I'd be

280
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:27,059
happy to see you go. Alright, so red wants rust gone. Rust wants Haley gone. Haley wants Molina

281
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:40,230
gone. Molina wants rust gone. This is like a long math problem. Unlike my SATs. Okay, rust is waiting

282
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:47,210
for you in Aquila territory. I don't have a weapon yet though. Haley won't talk unless you get rid

283
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:55,769
of rust. Where is he? Get rust. And I'll help. All right. Well, where is he? Which one is he?

284
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:04,019
That's booger. I'm watching you. Well, I punched him. I climbed this. Can I like grab onto this?

285
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:22,090
We're gonna go this way. Wow, man. Okay. Yeah, let's see if we can find somebody.

286
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:31,340
Oh, here we go. This is this is the territory. Wait, is it don't come here until I had a weapon?

287
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:47,190
All right. Yeah. Wait, I don't want to be here. Do I? You got two weapons lefty and righty.

288
00:51:49,750 --> 00:52:02,219
All right, we're looking for wah man. Red, Haley, Jack.

289
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:10,250
He's waiting. Everyone just keeps tipping me off on this. Do you think this guy's just sitting there

290
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,929
with a knife just holding it standing around the alley and everyone has told me that he's going to

291
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:26,840
try to kill me? I think it's time for a new strategy. I killed him. So.

292
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:38,150
All right. No extra content. Large alien is now available in the extra content menu.

293
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:53,579
Take it easy. Wait, wait, wait. Is this a weapon? Knuckle duster. Okay, that's a weapon.

294
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:07,699
Thanks. All right, let's go. All right, we're gonna go. Rust is waiting for me. He's gonna kill me.

295
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:15,340
I know this now. I'm gonna go to this territory. I'm gonna find out what's going on over here.

296
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:32,889
Okay, let's get it. He's here.

297
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:55,849
Walk it. Walk it. There it is. All right, you let's go. Was that who? Which one of you is rust?

298
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:26,699
Smash his head in. Good. Was that money? Oh, I got two knuckle dusters and cigarettes.

299
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:34,469
The Riddick team unlocked. Cool. Is it a healing station?

300
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:46,599
That shit is dangerously close to the eyes. Wait, wait, wait. I probably should hide these guys,

301
00:54:46,599 --> 00:55:12,860
right? Whatever. No, I wanted to. Okay. That was a little scary, but it didn't do anything.

302
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:21,820
Don't you think if you were this guy, you'd probably be like, oh shit, it didn't work.

303
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:31,500
It was supposed to explode, Riddick. I'm sorry. I want that knife. Walk it.

304
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:55,719
There we go. This is a mistake. Oh, this is green sludge on the ground. That's probably acid.

305
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,360
I'm gonna snap your head off and piss down your neck.

306
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:17,780
Oh shit. That was, I just like slashed him. I don't know how I stabbed him.

307
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:29,400
Oh, I thought I killed him. Damn it. I thought he died from that. Oh, you want to have an old

308
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:45,340
fashioned knife fight, do you? Come on. Oh, sorry about that. Can I have two knives? Oh no.

309
00:56:45,340 --> 00:57:05,320
This one's cooler. I wish you could do a weld. Somebody there. Wait, I know this guy. This guy

310
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:30,230
was in a cut scene. I can't believe that worked. Where is the principal? Where's the guard?

311
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:39,289
I'm dead. Where's the warden? Where's the warden?

312
00:57:46,630 --> 00:58:07,829
Get ready to die. Come on, do it. I'm trying to parry him. I'm trying. It's harder than he thinks.

313
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:26,489
Get away from me. I cannot parry this guy. I don't think I can parry him. Where's he? Where is he?

314
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:35,239
You can't parry him. He's a boss fight. Oh, well then I'll just kill him.

315
00:58:40,460 --> 00:59:07,110
Get ready. So fucking glad I'm not playing this on hard. Where you going? What's he doing?

316
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:51,449
Switching it up. I'm in my menu and he knows he's coming at me. He's so good. Why is he so good?

317
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:05,849
Why do I only have one stab? Just spam. He's going to kill me. Why do I only have this one

318
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:10,170
like lunging stab? All right, I'm just going to fucking spam. All right, I'll do it. Fine.

319
01:00:10,889 --> 01:01:00,699
It's taking so long. So this is the beast of Butchabay, huh? Head of the killing gang.

320
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,650
Hey, just out of curiosity, Riddick, how many tries did that take you?

321
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:14,019
Looks like I need a new rooster. Let's say four. They respect you now, Riddick. I can make things

322
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:25,500
easier. Say something and take that as a no. Saying no to me is not the kind of mistake you

323
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:33,030
want to make. Oh, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on right now? Am I supposed to be

324
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:43,139
hiding from these? But they have laser eyes. I don't know what we do. By the way,

325
01:01:43,139 --> 01:02:07,849
this is my kill. I wish you could throw. Shit, he fucking looked at me. I was trying to break

326
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:15,110
his neck and run. I hate when games give me freedom because I can die. I just don't stop.

327
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:29,219
All right, I'm just leaving. Fine. Here we go. Goodbye. Hey, what? Oh, stay the fuck away from

328
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:58,599
me. He gave me cigarettes. Am I a bad guy now? Do people think I'm bad? Okay, where do I go?

329
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:06,409
Rust is gone. You should go talk to Haley. Okay.

330
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:37,510
Dude, I think you got him. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh,

331
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:50,019
no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I gotta go. That was something, man.

332
01:03:50,019 --> 01:04:00,969
Hey, thanks. No, don't break everybody's neck. I need NPCs. It's gonna be like Dark Souls where

333
01:04:00,969 --> 01:04:11,190
if you kill all the NPCs, like the game sucks. I'm done. Get the gun. I can't get the gun. The guy

334
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:28,489
electrocuted my... It said unauthorized access. I can't get the gun. It's locked. Break this guy's

335
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:48,730
neck. No, I can't kill everybody. I'm sorry. I can't. I didn't do that. Right? I didn't do that.

336
01:04:48,730 --> 01:05:00,659
You did. I did not do that. He forgot. He blacked out and did it. All right. Where's my reward?

337
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:11,400
Where are you? Hey. I heard you rejected Abbott. That's integrity. So I'll keep my word. What do

338
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:21,300
you want to know about? Pit. Looks like a way out. Way out? Sure. Raise some hell. Raise some hell and

339
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:27,880
they throw you down. If you manage to stay alive, there's supposed to be a way into Pigsville from

340
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:36,360
down there. But it's never been done. I like a challenge. Well, then Pigsville's your place.

341
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,519
The space board hangers. This looks like space, doesn't it?

342
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,059
Because that's why I've been dying. Okay.

343
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,619
If you want to get through the infirmary gates, there's this hack names Boulder.

344
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:27,260
He owes me 150. Talk to him. What about you? No, I almost did it. All right. Talk to Boulder to get

345
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:37,739
into the infirmary. I have to start to remember names. Boulder. It was booger. Where's Boulder?

346
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:57,690
Boulder. I don't know where I can find Boulder. Do the Vin Diesel voice. Funny man. You must

347
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:07,619
have just, I've done it like five times. Fine. That's Snape. Let me change it. I can't do it

348
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:15,139
anymore. It's Snape again. I can't do it. It's always going to be Snape. I have to delete that

349
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:22,099
from my mind. No, it's I will see you in an hour. Just stay for an hour. You'll figure it out.

350
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:44,489
I can't. All right. Where's Boulder? Hey, Haley says you owe him. You should get that money from

351
01:07:44,489 --> 01:07:48,730
you. Riddick. You screwed my bet on rush when you figure it out. Yeah. I don't know what that

352
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:56,489
means yourself, but betting against me now. It looks like a thumb and you look like how I

353
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:19,500
feel like shit. Okay. Go on through. Hurry up. Thanks dude. Appreciate it. Open. All right. Now

354
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,619
what do I have to go? I have to find a necklace that's going to give me powers. What do I do?

355
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:36,100
I don't, I'm not going to do it. What's going on in here? Uh-oh. Just wait here for the doctor.

356
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:42,539
Don't you fucking dare move. That sounds like a guy that never gets to say swears in his

357
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:53,109
parents' house. Hey, I'm still, I'm waiting for the doctor. What the fuck is wrong with you?

358
01:08:54,260 --> 01:09:00,359
For all you know, I could be the doctor. Okay. Get out of here. What's going on with this guy?

359
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:22,140
Stomach cramps. Take care of that. Jesus Christ. He just lit that guy up. He lit that guy up. All

360
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:31,619
right. I feel bad now. I feel bad now. That guy ate all the bullets. I feel terrible. That guy

361
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:39,350
inhaled all of them. Okay. Hey, just wait here for the doctor. Don't you fucking dare move.

362
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:48,890
Okay. I have to, I have to address this. Somebody went snap fingers, snap fingers. Hey, funny guy,

363
01:09:48,890 --> 01:10:15,460
do the funny voices like, get out of here. No, where's this doctor? Don't come over here. You

364
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:38,170
saw me do that, but I, you're, wait, what? I have the code. I think the door came down and crushed

365
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:46,340
me. Just wait here for the doctor. Don't you fucking. All right. I need to obviously distract

366
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:50,100
them somehow. The doctor's never coming. Or am I just so impatient that I can't do this?

367
01:10:50,739 --> 01:11:03,140
What does, what does the doctor look like? Well, this guy, this guy doesn't have a gun.

368
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:08,970
Is this the doctor? All right. Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the door. Don't

369
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,770
break the doctor's neck when he opens the door. Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the

370
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:57,699
door. He's going to write it on the chalkboard a thousand times. I mean, this is dark. I'm in the

371
01:11:57,699 --> 01:12:14,010
dark. He can't see anything. What's going on? What is happening? I think that guy's stuck in the door.

372
01:12:14,010 --> 01:13:04,380
Okay. All right. Now you can't pick these up. Oh damn. Security code. Put them down. Put them

373
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:34,359
down. Put them down. All right. I got the security code. That means I can leave. Got it. What?

374
01:13:35,619 --> 01:14:00,579
What are you just standing there? Die. Die. Oh, you have a code on you. That was the doctor. I see.

375
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:17,699
Okay. What's in here? Some type of weird laboratory machine. I use it. Use health station. Oh,

376
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,420
this looks like that thing at Dave and Buster's that you ride the roller coaster.

377
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,729
Why is that still in Dave and Buster's by the way? That shit was really, really interesting.

378
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:35,529
Probably 15 years ago that like that was this VR. Now you don't have to watch like a TV screen

379
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:52,859
while your seat moves. I don't even need the help. I should be sneaking around way more often. Can

380
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:58,180
I pick this up? This looks like an exploding barrel. He's going to turn the corner and shoot

381
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:08,520
the exploding barrel. Isn't it? And now I'm up top. All right. So is there anybody up here?

382
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:32,359
Oh, oh shit. Okay. Wait for him to walk by permanent health upgrade. Are you serious?

383
01:15:32,920 --> 01:16:02,979
How do I use it? Oh, all right. Do I want to pick skiing roller coaster or I'm in an airplane?

384
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:27,350
That was all right. You're way too close. You're too close. Yeah. Don't do that again.

385
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:41,880
Don't do that again or you're going to be real sorry. All right. This is a safe point. So I can

386
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:49,560
doesn't matter service hatch, but wait. Oh, done. Done. I can't pick up the gun. The DNA.

387
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:59,689
Look, look guys. Look, ready? Look, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I cannot pick up the

388
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:18,649
gun. I don't have the DNA qualification, whatever the hell it is. Look, look at, look, stay. I love

389
01:17:18,649 --> 01:17:42,010
it. Is he going to climb in the hatch? Are they looking for me? Like, can I just jump on people?

390
01:17:44,500 --> 01:18:16,600
Where is this guy? All right. Keep going. Right. Going on. All right. Give me up there. I'm going

391
01:18:20,569 --> 01:18:43,560
right, right, right. Going on, I guess. Hey, I'm just didn't even. Oh, I'll smart it again.

392
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:56,149
Oh, that's me. That's my cue, right? That's where I want to go.

393
01:18:57,109 --> 01:19:31,720
Security code. Wait, I dump them down there. No. Okay. Well, I can stand up now. Where's the key

394
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:49,020
code? Grab the gun. You can't get the gun. There's no gun. Um, and who's killed me?

395
01:19:50,060 --> 01:20:11,029
Got to stay in the dark. Security code. All right. I think somebody walked by. We'll wait for them.

396
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:31,479
Where is he? All right. Now, wait, no, no. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

397
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:39,529
Somebody comes from the other angle. Yep. Who's that? Somebody's pointing at me. Wait,

398
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:54,380
that's a spotlight. It's on me. All right. This guy have tranquilizer darts. I'm dead again

399
01:20:54,380 --> 01:21:04,359
instantly. All right. You know what? Fuck it. Got to stay in the dark. No, I get it. This is a

400
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:13,449
stealth part of the mission where you can, you instantly die. I get it. I stay in the dark.

401
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:32,819
Why did he turn around? What? Okay. Can, does the spotlight move? Why is the spotlight move?

402
01:21:32,819 --> 01:22:05,380
It just stays right there. All right. But eat, eat what? I don't have anything to eat.

403
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:28,039
I'm going to eat. I made it. I'm good. Eat a McDLT. I would right now. The main frame.

404
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:41,180
Security will be tight. Sure. Like a challenge. That's the kind of voice that you use when it's

405
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:45,770
like one o'clock in the morning and you're talking to like a significant other or like,

406
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:50,250
you know, a person of interest. Like we get laid at night and you just like talking like that.

407
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:56,250
Like what's up? Yeah. Just hanging out. Just chilling. I don't know why we people do that.

408
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:01,609
It's just, it's just sound like sexy. I don't, I don't know what it means. Why do we do that?

409
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:07,819
Like I very clearly could just put my head up and be like, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:20,229
I don't think I'm supposed to be down here. How does this guy happen? Give me the DNA sample.

411
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:32,359
Wait, he didn't have it on him. What was this random engineer with like a staff?

412
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:45,800
Oh, give me that. I want your staff. Hold on. I can use guns now. Oh yeah, they do.

413
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:14,420
I never had any gun training in my life. I lost the CQC training though. God. I'm so stupid.

414
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:27,420
Now things get interesting. All right. Well, I didn't know they were going to pour in here.

415
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:54,939
All right. Bring it on. Okay. Give me all the ammo. How do I reload the gun?

416
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:34,710
Wait, gun. Oh, cool. I got gun. Gun. What? Oh, I'm dead. Didn't come in. What are they? Oh,

417
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:55,239
that's, it's supposed to blow up a wall. Oh, health station. Debris. Oh, was he going to burn me?

418
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:13,130
I can't even see me down here, dude. You can't. He didn't see me down there. That's ridiculous.

419
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:16,970
You get a key code on it. Shotgun. Better. I'll take the shotgun over anything else.

420
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:28,739
My favorite weapon. Wait, was this a, oh, I thought this was a vent to go into.

421
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:33,380
Do I have to destroy this? I'm like trying to crawl in it. What do I have to do with this?

422
01:26:49,140 --> 01:27:12,810
Did I miss something? Oh, use the screwdriver. I'm just going to climb. I guess. Yeah. Okay. Climb.

423
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:16,539
I just said open service panel. I didn't know what it was supposed to mean.

424
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:26,460
Oh, Cindy's. I'll get it back up there. Wait, I might be able to jump on top of people. This

425
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:38,380
might be fun to go that way. But wait, can I jump on somebody's head? No. All right. We're

426
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:53,300
going to just go from here to there. Who's taking a look? Hmm. Nothing here. Oh, he's right there.

427
01:27:53,300 --> 01:28:05,380
Okay. Headshot. No, I can't see in here. Keep looking. Don't even, don't even do it. Just go.

428
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:12,180
Wait, it's my opportunity. I noticed something. I want to check who's there.

429
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,060
This is my opportunity to do it. Yeah, not here, but I know he's around.

430
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:33,319
Hmm. What? Why didn't that work? Didn't it say you could jump on people's heads?

431
01:28:36,779 --> 01:29:01,619
I feel like I was lied to. Turn back. How do you have, there's no fucking way you have more

432
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:13,270
reaction time than me on that one. Wait, I get to try this again.

433
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:34,069
Melee weapon. All right. Walk down here. Come on, man. Let's go.

434
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:51,859
And I heard something. Go walk over here. Both of you idiots. He's being body blocked. He wants

435
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:58,260
going on here. He's so badly wants to go home. He desperately wants to keep looking, but this guy

436
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:04,180
keeps getting in his way. Just let him do an investigation. Someone's here. I didn't mean to

437
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:26,890
jump through. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm dead. God damn it. Well, they wouldn't walk.

438
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:35,640
They couldn't get the guy to move. All right. There's a heel right there. Just got to kill this

439
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:50,569
guy. One, two. What? I hear another guy shooting. I'm going to have to prefire. Where is he? Oh,

440
01:30:50,569 --> 01:30:54,569
did I get him? I don't know. Did I get him? I still hear the Metal Gear Solid music.

441
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:19,590
He's up. I don't know. Where is he? I don't know where he is. He's right. Okay. I see him,

442
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:39,130
but how the fuck am I going to aim over there? I have an idea. How are they seeing me? What?

443
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:59,100
Where am I? Where? He should have been through the, he tried to shoot me through the grate.

444
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:03,369
He's trying to shoot me through the grate. I got to take it fast. What would, what would Riddick do?

445
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:24,579
What a shitty movie. This is how I used to play paintball when I was a kid. I was so scared. I

446
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:29,460
didn't want to have so badly. Didn't want to get hit at the whole game. I would just stay in one

447
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:46,710
spot and just kind of peek out and go and then just immediately get back in. Am I dead? Okay.

448
01:32:46,710 --> 01:33:14,260
You can connect again, please. Thank you. Okay. I can't shoot him through the grate, but he can

449
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:23,380
shoot me through the grate. I'm done with this bullshit. I'm just fucking lighten up. I'm just

450
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:40,600
lighten them up. You know what I mean? I fell through the grate. Come on, let's go. Get it.

451
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:59,479
Show it. Go on. Go on. Dude, I'm supposed to be able to see in the dark. Okay. But how's this,

452
01:33:59,479 --> 01:34:20,310
does it make any sense? Riddick's supposed to be able to see in the dark. Not yet. Who said that?

453
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:25,939
That guy was blending into the environment. That guy was actually not a person. He was like a wall.

454
01:34:35,369 --> 01:35:13,460
Uh oh. Gas. That was easy. Did you do that for fun or I don't... Okay. Wait, there's a little more gas

455
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:27,180
over here. This is not open. Can I... I can't go that way. Oh, is there a way to make the wall

456
01:35:27,180 --> 01:36:07,979
explode? I get it. D-pad? No. I gotta get... I have to go down. I have eight bullets. What? Where did

457
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:28,020
that guy go? Give me a checkpoint. Can we go back to like punching inmates and like laughing at

458
01:36:28,020 --> 01:37:02,550
toilets? All right. This looks like a boss area. All right. I'm gonna use gun. Okay. Thanks. Oh,

459
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:08,069
nice dodging. Oh, why am I the boss? You know what I mean? Like that's how you would dodge the boss.

460
01:37:08,069 --> 01:37:29,689
I'm the boss and he just, he's the one that's playing the game. Why did he explode? Can I leave?

461
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:42,460
Hello? Everybody gone? Oh, shit. This one guy. Oh my god. He's right here. Oh my god. He's gonna

462
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:57,460
hit me once. I'm gonna die. Where are you? Where? There's another guy. Where's the other guy?

463
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:27,619
There's a... There's another guy? Oh, no. It's the space marine. This is so lame.

464
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:56,020
Hold on. Wait. Let me reload. Why am I holding the gun like this? Oh, come on. I have to shoot him in

465
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:08,340
the back? Oh. I have to get in a spot. There's the grenade. All right. I'm going over here.

466
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:32,939
I'm already almost dead. Give me the... Oh, I got him in the head. Okay. I got him.

467
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:49,880
Stand still for a second. All right. Nice. Now, is there a... Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait,

468
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:56,939
wait. Is that... Can I get the health back? He goes, hey. Oh, no. Where do I hide? I'm gonna

469
01:39:56,939 --> 01:40:14,329
hide over here. Do I hide over here? Am I technically in the dark? I'm in the dark

470
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:30,869
right now. Okay. He can't see me. He's getting... Is he getting closer or further away? Destroy the

471
01:40:30,869 --> 01:41:03,500
lights? Oh, shit. Where... Oh, there he is. He can't see me, right? I'm invisible. I thought I was

472
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:23,430
invisible, man. Just anything. I got him. Holy shit. He's so easy. Oh, you just have to shoot

473
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:30,920
him in the back once. Oh, okay. I think he's still in there. That would not have killed him. I think

474
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:40,619
he's still in there. I think he's... Can I drag the body? I need a heal thing. Check the bodies.

475
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:58,680
Get weapons. Get ammo. Set that thing up because it's annoying. Oh, you can. All right. I got ammo.

476
01:42:00,199 --> 01:42:29,460
Good. Let's go. Lights off. Isn't there still a riot going on? Yeah, I can hear it. Hey, Xbox off.

477
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:34,819
It's not an Xbox one. They weren't smart enough back then. Special task forces are now entering

478
01:42:34,819 --> 01:42:47,460
the cell block. Stay low and do not move. What did that say? What did that say? I had like a prompt.

479
01:42:47,460 --> 01:43:25,609
What was it? You guys saw that, right? Why am I turning on? What did I do? All right. Let's go.

480
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:48,810
All right. There's some... Okay. Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.

481
01:43:50,010 --> 01:44:05,479
Oh, that's a turret shooting at me. Where is it? That's just a big bright light. I don't even know

482
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:34,060
where it is. Is that a turret? There was a guy hiding in the shadows, too. I'm telling you,

483
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:39,180
more and more every day, I feel like an NPC playing the game with the protagonist fighting me.

484
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,630
Yeah. Turn this on. I don't know if this does, but it does something.

485
01:44:43,270 --> 01:45:10,090
Let your big brother help you. No. I want to play. Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to

486
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:28,600
lethal. Turret down. Where's another turret? Is that a turret right there? Yep. Turn off the light.

487
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:37,449
Where's the guy that's here? Oh, he's dead. All right. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead.

488
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:45,449
Where am I supposed to be going? Turn off all the lights. I need them, though,

489
01:45:45,449 --> 01:45:52,520
because I can't see shit either. I'm just making the game harder for myself. I can't see in the

490
01:45:52,520 --> 01:46:31,319
dark. Is that a good guy? That's a turret! Whoa. Who's who? Take your sunglasses off.

491
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:59,300
Hello? Holy shit. It's behind me. What? Where is it? Is that it? I'm so confused. I was

492
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:55,220
getting shot from behind. That's a shadow. Fuck. I got him. I need tape. Where is it?

493
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:12,149
Where? I don't know where it is. Why is it super dark now? What happened? Where the fuck am I?

494
01:48:13,109 --> 01:48:26,020
Did I turn off the lights on my stream? Who is it? I don't understand what's going on.

495
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:33,189
How did I get over here? Wasn't somebody over here? It was a guy here. Where's my gun? What

496
01:48:33,189 --> 01:49:02,460
happened? Did I do it? Oh, shit. Get that light off. Get this light off. Turn that light off. Oh,

497
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:26,100
wait. That's outside. You can't do that. Turn this one off. Who's the fucking turret? Of course it

498
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:35,939
was. Of course it was. All right. Did I get the heal? I have the heal. All right. Let's go. Wait.

499
01:49:35,939 --> 01:49:48,649
Turn the valve. I still don't even know what this does. I don't instantly lose three bars.

500
01:49:50,779 --> 01:49:51,899
I didn't do anything.

501
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:49,819
Oh, it's dead. Okay. I got full health. Good. Fuck you. Okay. I got it. Look at my health,

502
01:50:49,819 --> 01:51:00,279
man. Oh my God. You guys are already playing on hard. No. I shot that guy like four times.

503
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:19,609
I still can't figure out what's happening to that guy.

504
01:51:20,569 --> 01:51:25,739
Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.

505
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:50,659
This dude just explodes. Where is it? Right here? Oh, I got it. Good job. All right. Don't let this

506
01:51:50,659 --> 01:52:23,350
guy kill me. He doesn't even know where I am. Holy shit. Wait. That's a speaker. It's over here.

507
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:43,560
Oh, why did I just panic? All right. I don't want to visit. Where's the turret? I know there's one

508
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:54,979
over here somewhere. Isn't there? Wait. There's a guy. All right. Hold on. Wait for the guy. Wait.

509
01:52:54,979 --> 01:53:04,010
It's an explosive. Is that an explosive? It's not an explosive. Shit. I thought it was a barrel.

510
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:20,939
Those bullets came from behind me. Why? Where is that? They hit something behind me.

511
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:46,020
It ricocheted. Oh, dude. Fuck this. Okay. Good. Where is it? Is that it? Yep. Okay. There's another

512
01:53:46,020 --> 01:54:05,189
one. That's not it. All right. I'm going to get the safety of the bathroom. I wish there was a

513
01:54:05,189 --> 01:54:08,710
heal in the bathroom. I don't know what that is, but I'm going to take it. What is that?

514
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:46,069
Nanomed cartridge. Did I not even? You can't be fucked. How is it still hitting me? Oh, God damn

515
01:54:46,069 --> 01:55:13,560
it. I'm just using the light. I don't care. I can't see anything. I'm using the light. It makes it

516
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:19,880
worse. Nevermind. Oh shit. He's coming down the hall. He's coming down the hall. He's coming down

517
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:37,350
the hall. Where is it? He's coming down the hall. Just wait for him. Why is this guy can see me?

518
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:53,560
That just actually hurt my chest. That just scared the shit out of me. Go back and heal. Oh,

519
01:56:00,039 --> 01:56:04,039
all right. I'm going. I'm just fucking going fast. I know where they are. I'm

520
01:56:20,489 --> 01:56:23,210
switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.

521
01:56:26,010 --> 01:56:52,420
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yep. Okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Okay. I'm not. Let's go.

522
01:56:53,220 --> 01:57:12,250
Where is it? What do I hear? Like a ticking sound. The turret on my right. Oh, thank you.

523
01:57:20,810 --> 01:57:38,810
The game has an auto. I can turn the auto aim off. That's the problem. Where is it? Where is it?

524
01:57:38,810 --> 01:58:22,500
Where is it? Okay. Now go heal. Where is she? All right. I feel more calm. Did I get a permanent

525
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:41,609
health upgrade? Where'd it go? I don't have a permanent health upgrade. Oh, it only had one

526
01:58:41,609 --> 01:58:44,890
charge. Okay. All right. Not going to let this guy kill me this time. Not going to blow it.

527
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:59,670
He's just waiting. I didn't get him in the head. All right. Hold on. He's dead. But now is I think

528
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:33,819
a turret over here. All right. Let's fucking go. Con the hacks into opening it. What? Who's the

529
01:59:33,819 --> 01:59:49,319
hacks? Are you a hack? I think I needed that guy. Are you alive? Get up. Do you have a thing on you?

530
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:56,069
Does that guy have a thing on him? I need you to come with me and open this door over here.

531
01:59:59,829 --> 02:00:28,170
My one hacker. You. This is so hard to control. Where's the other one? He's right over there.

532
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:41,130
Come on. Where? I need a hacker. Hacker. Wait, he just opened the door. Holy shit. He opened the

533
02:00:41,130 --> 02:01:30,760
door. I got in. All right. Now that door is open or something, right? God damn it. Give me a

534
02:01:30,760 --> 02:02:04,920
checkpoint. I couldn't. I tried. Okay. I got you. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Yes. What?

535
02:02:07,479 --> 02:02:21,239
I would love it if the credits just rolled. It was a slow close up to Vin Diesel's face. His eyes

536
02:02:21,239 --> 02:02:38,390
are wide open and he's just fucking dead. I do have an, would that actually work?

537
02:02:39,189 --> 02:02:45,739
If there was a person underneath you and you fell and you landed right on them, would they die?

538
02:02:46,699 --> 02:02:52,279
Okay. What if it was like five people? I'm talking like you have one, two, three, four, five,

539
02:02:52,279 --> 02:02:57,029
and you're like, you're like the sixth person. Still no.

540
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:28,069
This is a timed mission. What is it? Gollum? What was that? Oh shit. Oh my God. It really is.

541
02:03:36,729 --> 02:03:44,460
Oh my goodness. This just turned into a completely different video game in the last 30 seconds.

542
02:03:47,399 --> 02:04:03,180
I feel like I'm playing killing floor. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Oh no.

543
02:04:04,539 --> 02:04:31,979
Okay. What do I, I don't know what the goal is. Open this door. Why don't bullets work anymore

544
02:04:31,979 --> 02:04:48,279
on these explosive barrels? Okay. I think it's scripted. It's not actually five minutes.

545
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:20,819
See, we're good. We're good. Don't waste ammo. Yeah. You're right. Make way for the messenger.

546
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:39,819
Justice and vengeance. Is this guy talking? Wait, was there a guy over here?

547
02:05:56,789 --> 02:06:27,899
I don't know. I don't even know where to go. I think I got it. Did I get it? This looks new.

548
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:58,119
I think this is new. This is new. No, wait, which are you kidding me? This estimated time to failure,

549
02:06:58,119 --> 02:07:23,670
two minutes. Get away from me. I found it. I found it. I found it. Oh my God. I have no,

550
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:34,220
where am I supposed to go? Was I not supposed to go down? Keep turning left. You will get there.

551
02:07:42,010 --> 02:08:00,199
That's going to put me in a circle. There was a find the exit from the pit. Estimated time to

552
02:08:00,199 --> 02:08:07,529
failure. Well, this is not good. Okay. So if this goes over here, I can go up, but that just leads

553
02:08:07,529 --> 02:08:14,229
me back up anyways, right? Or should I go this way? Is it broken? No, that just leads me back up.

554
02:08:14,869 --> 02:08:21,850
Wasn't somebody was just talking to me over here? Is there more than one ways to go?

555
02:08:22,649 --> 02:08:34,310
There was a guy over here that was talking. Okay. Right here. So what's going on here? Can I jump

556
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:58,010
up? Can I like blast through this? Can I open this? The hole. Okay. I'm sorry, but no, no, no,

557
02:08:58,489 --> 02:09:07,939
no, no. You're talking about this hole right here. This hole here. That's not, I don't fit through

558
02:09:07,939 --> 02:09:24,250
there. I already bullets. I can't fit through this hole. You have to squeeze through. I definitely

559
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:50,649
cannot make it through there. There's a way up through the top. Is there? I don't see anything.

560
02:09:51,210 --> 02:10:02,090
It's the longest one minute I think I've ever seen. Stop going down here in the first place.

561
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:30,520
Explore the first floor. I don't even have a flashlight. Okay. This is the first floor.

562
02:10:39,579 --> 02:10:49,720
Please play. I have no idea what it felt. I have to jump up on one of like the banisters.

563
02:10:49,720 --> 02:11:06,359
Okay. I found it. I went every single place, but here it's come on. Give me a break. I don't have

564
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:20,069
any bullets. I'm sorry. This is, I'm, I'm in a lot of trouble. Leave us be sinners. This lamb is

565
02:11:20,069 --> 02:11:32,300
special. You need fighting. I'm fighting somebody in the dark. The lights could turn on. This could

566
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:47,239
end up being like a little kid. I can't, maybe it'll reload me with actual bullets and shit.

567
02:11:48,039 --> 02:11:53,619
Yeah. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

568
02:11:55,060 --> 02:12:03,060
I know where to go. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Uh huh. Uh huh. Sure. Sure. Sure.

569
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:07,939
Give me the lore. Give me the story. I don't, I don't care about any of that. I just want to,

570
02:12:07,939 --> 02:12:28,420
hold on. It's over here. It's over here. Hey, you open that up. Make way for the messenger.

571
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:43,659
I am the light, justice and vengeance of the universe. Okay. At least I have two bullets.

572
02:12:43,659 --> 02:12:53,640
I have 50. Nevermind. I'm good to go. Okay. Good. We, we've done it. Leave us be sinners.

573
02:12:54,649 --> 02:13:04,380
This lamb is special. That's not explosive. Five minutes. All right. What does he want?

574
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:35,079
Wait, did he just do the suicide squad Joker? You know, he is, he's going, ah, ah, ah.

575
02:13:35,079 --> 02:13:47,659
Yeah. Aim better. You won't survive long dripping blood. The dwellers will

576
02:13:48,460 --> 02:14:07,819
smell. He told me, he told me you would come. Come. We must travel up here. I live above.

577
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:23,109
Am I still crouching? No. You need that gaze that shows right from wrong and reveals the door.

578
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:48,310
Oh, what's this? Flares. What can you do with a flare? He spoke to me,

579
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:59,720
but how do I know you're not a simple imposter? Can you stitch me or not? Yes. Yes. But first,

580
02:15:00,520 --> 02:15:07,260
get me back my blessing. Boys box, a dangerous task made more so by the dwellers.

581
02:15:07,979 --> 02:15:16,420
It would prove that you are what he told me. I don't the boss box and I would tend to your wounds.

582
02:15:17,140 --> 02:15:22,899
The flails in that box will provide the light you need. God, not another one of these.

583
02:15:25,670 --> 02:15:32,220
How many do I have? How do they work? And they do anything special.

584
02:16:03,779 --> 02:16:09,029
They don't last very long. I can get more than seven. How many can I have?

585
02:16:09,029 --> 02:16:32,020
Oh, okay. Get my blessing. I think I ended up with a broken elbow after that one.

586
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:39,260
All right, let's go. You cured my, you cured my hangover, but you gave me a broken arm.

587
02:16:39,260 --> 02:17:02,819
All right. You want us to leave lights, press the light button. I can't turn my flashlight off.

588
02:17:02,819 --> 02:17:12,729
All right. So what does he want me to do? Pope Joe's seems to be able to help you. If you can

589
02:17:12,729 --> 02:17:35,059
find his blessed voice box. Do we have to go down? It's a radio. All right. So I have 12

590
02:17:35,059 --> 02:17:58,329
flares. So what the hell am I supposed to do? Oh, find his voice box. Just find it. Okay.

591
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:10,170
I'm gonna see if I can find it. This is what the flares are for. God damn it.

592
02:18:10,809 --> 02:18:16,579
You know how awesome this game must have been to develop. Imagine being a game designer and a world

593
02:18:16,579 --> 02:18:24,090
designer and you only have to make a walkway right here. Nothing else matters. Everything

594
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:30,250
else doesn't need to be rendered. You could hide so much shit in the darkness. Speaking of the

595
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:56,979
darkness. Somebody somebody right in front of me. Okay. I picked them back up. No. Shit. How many

596
02:18:56,979 --> 02:19:11,579
people are in front of me? All right. I know there's a door there. Got it. Where is it? I can hear it.

597
02:19:13,690 --> 02:19:40,409
I hear this damn thing. Thank you. Let's go out. What is this guy gonna help me do? Um,

598
02:19:41,049 --> 02:20:12,540
shit. I don't know. I don't. Where's the exit? All right. Let's go. This is gonna he's gonna

599
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:16,540
give me night vision. Wait, is he gonna give me the thing that I can actually see in the dark?

600
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:36,780
That would be awesome. Here you go. Bring all blessings ready. Have everything prepared inside.

601
02:20:37,739 --> 02:20:38,819
Nice.

602
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:42,100
Somebody got it. Thanks. Why am I thanking you for getting a reference to a game

603
02:21:42,180 --> 02:22:00,100
here? Do not trust all that you see. At least not yet. Your destiny lies elsewhere. I really feel

604
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:03,940
like the only way you can talk like this is seriously if you lie down in bed with your chin

605
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:09,860
down, you have to have just woken up. You have to just open your eyes and put the bike in front of

606
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:53,930
you. I sound like this sometimes in the morning. So wait, I'm now it's very bright and I can see in

607
02:22:53,930 --> 02:23:10,340
the dark. Now I can't look at lights. I only said auto voice. With your new shined eyes,

608
02:23:10,340 --> 02:23:18,629
you can see in the dark. Press up to toggle night vision on and off. That's not very good.

609
02:23:19,909 --> 02:23:30,299
Uh, why don't I just get night vision goggles? I wouldn't have to completely ruin my body and

610
02:23:30,299 --> 02:23:33,579
have a weird surgery and shit. Just put on night vision goggles. They're better than this.

611
02:23:34,139 --> 02:23:51,590
What year does this take place? Night vision goggles have to exist, right? This is 2020,

612
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:57,899
2020, 2203. It's going to be a real pain in the ass once we go up 100.

613
02:23:59,639 --> 02:24:10,120
Like how do you say to like, okay, the year 2106, 2106, 2106, 216. So how do you,

614
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:25,219
how are you going to say that? Yeah, once it gets to like 200, like 2645, 2645. Yeah, I guess it's

615
02:24:25,219 --> 02:24:38,149
not that hard. I really don't like this. This just reminds me of putting on 3d glasses and looking at

616
02:24:38,149 --> 02:25:04,840
the regular world and not the screen. Can't talk. Turn up the gamma. I could. Does the character

617
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:12,520
even have a goal? Do I just have night vision? Find the exit into Pigsville. He's just like,

618
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:19,500
all right, get out of here. Ready? Go have some fun with your new 3d glasses. Okay. This is fun.

619
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:35,059
And what was it? What do I do? What's the point of this whole universe this way?

620
02:25:36,649 --> 02:25:47,290
Wait, I came from this way. Fucking mazes. I just spit all over the monitor right now.

621
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:53,370
Whatever. This doesn't even help. This doesn't help. This doesn't help me. I would rather have

622
02:25:53,370 --> 02:26:36,680
the flashlight on. I earn the gamma up. I will. I will. I will. I feel like that's cheating.

623
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:50,280
Oh my God. A ladder. Thank you. Go. That's an old link. Everybody's like, I'm going to get them.

624
02:26:50,360 --> 02:27:06,180
I'm going to get them. Oh, light. Thank God. Turn up the gamma, you sardine.

625
02:27:11,430 --> 02:27:29,479
Oh, that hurts. Don't use that up here. Did I have a gun? I'm still technically in the prison,

626
02:27:29,479 --> 02:27:43,530
right? Something's going on here. I'm going to take a look. Wasn't that guy just really

627
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:51,540
came out of like the bathroom? The lights on? No. How could he see in the dark? Does everybody

628
02:27:51,540 --> 02:28:19,989
have the Riddick 3d glasses power? Wait, he was actually in the bathroom. Don't turn those lights

629
02:28:19,989 --> 02:28:40,420
on. Keep them off. Oh, but wait, I can open all. Oh, I can open all the lockers. Oh, money. What

630
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:57,739
do you even spend the money on? Well, you know, this actually really reminds me of this. I feel

631
02:28:57,739 --> 02:29:10,200
like I'm really drunk looking from my hotel room. This one is two or one. No, I find it is up here.

632
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:22,180
Oh, there's a rifle in there. I mean, they close one eye and get really, really close.

633
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:42,920
Two and two. That's not it. Move. I want to open this one. There's going to be a secret in these.

634
02:29:42,920 --> 02:30:00,709
Yep. Civilian outfit now. I don't even need to do this. I can just walk around, right?

635
02:30:00,709 --> 02:30:20,780
Can't even shoot that shit. Stupid. I am now dressed as him. See? All right. Cool. I mean,

636
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:29,110
I know you. What's the point of having these clothes on if I don't wear a mask?

637
02:30:31,479 --> 02:30:47,079
I'm very recognizable. This is why I need to get a whatever. Get a fake beard. These guys recognize

638
02:30:47,079 --> 02:31:03,540
me. What is this one? Two. All right. That hurts my eyes. The gun. I don't have a gun anymore. I'm

639
02:31:03,540 --> 02:31:15,860
fine. Six, 12, 17. Okay. You're a celebrity. I don't have anything on me. Look, I don't like

640
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:30,950
this guy's walking at me. Six, 12, 17. Can I talk? How are you doing? How are you doing?

641
02:31:33,959 --> 02:31:43,350
I'm all right. Can we go in here? Whose room is that? Okay. Let's go over here.

642
02:31:43,829 --> 02:31:59,989
Get me out of here. Can I get him? Hey, you're an inmate. He's an inmate. Get him.

643
02:32:11,180 --> 02:32:35,379
The guy go behind him T-pose and die. What? Somebody's fucking with me. He's like,

644
02:32:36,979 --> 02:33:02,840
don't get too close. That's how they see through you. I'm just being annoying. I'm just ringing

645
02:33:02,840 --> 02:33:14,090
everybody's doorbells and then running away. All right. He's practicing his speech. Cool.

646
02:33:14,809 --> 02:33:34,629
2012. All right. Get you go that way. Don't look at me. You'll recognize me as Riddick. Wait,

647
02:33:34,629 --> 02:33:45,829
talk to who? What's up? Hey, can I do anything? No, you can't. What's up? How come this guy

648
02:33:45,829 --> 02:34:08,860
instantly right? Because I had a gun in my hand. How are you doing? Oh, okay. Nine, seven, 12.

649
02:34:10,219 --> 02:34:19,850
Oh, are you going to open the door? No. What would the somebody get? Have you heard anything

650
02:34:19,850 --> 02:34:29,270
about that Riddick? No. Okay. See you. No, I haven't heard anything.

651
02:34:35,110 --> 02:34:41,909
So if wouldn't everybody know that I have a really low voice, how does Vin Diesel do a higher voice

652
02:34:41,909 --> 02:34:45,510
if he doesn't want people, you know, how does he do like the, how does it go like this? Can he

653
02:34:47,110 --> 02:35:04,549
feel like Vin Diesel? I don't think he'd be able to do it. Hey, if you see, what am I doing?

654
02:35:04,549 --> 02:35:13,209
Just get out, right? I just have to leave. Have you heard anything about that Riddick?

655
02:35:13,209 --> 02:35:35,670
What are you doing? Can't open this. This is the find a way out. Does something to do with the

656
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:53,879
codes that I'm seeing like the hamburger codes? I feel like it is. It's a hole. Have you heard

657
02:35:53,879 --> 02:36:03,930
anything? Oh, I'm saying hole, hole, hole, hole. Where, where, where? I don't see a hole.

658
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:28,329
Really? What the fuck? Dude, come on. I was just trying to show off on Instagram. Leave me alone.

659
02:36:28,889 --> 02:36:34,629
We have a really boring fucking job. We walk in circles. I'm trying to spice it up a little.

660
02:36:34,629 --> 02:37:05,590
Have you heard anything about that Riddick? It's definitely something to do with like the ham.

661
02:37:07,299 --> 02:37:28,969
What? Why did I just do that? All right. Don't be weird. They'll kill you Hank. Okay. So where

662
02:37:28,969 --> 02:37:38,010
am I supposed to go? And one of these were the computers. How are you doing? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

663
02:37:38,010 --> 02:38:01,000
Okay. I forgot about this part. Get you out of there. 6, 12, 17. One of these doorbells is

664
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:12,250
going to do something. I know it. Six, nine, seven, 12. I'm just going to ring until somebody

665
02:38:12,250 --> 02:38:49,590
answers. I'll find the right NPC when I ring every doorbell. What's happening? I found it.

666
02:38:49,590 --> 02:39:12,280
Hey. Hey. Hey there. Hi. No, not the probe. No, no. Uh, okay. Are you, you all right, man?

667
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:33,559
I'm having a lot of butt head reactions. I'm noticing today. Uh, okay, man. Bye. See you later.

668
02:39:33,559 --> 02:39:53,350
Uh, okay. An elation hatch. I can't touch it. I can't open it. Why is that locked up? Why? Why?

669
02:39:53,350 --> 02:40:13,059
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I need a tool. Shit. I need a tool. Where do you guys has a tool

670
02:40:13,059 --> 02:40:30,250
on you? You have a tool. Hi there. This is not going to work. Why would I do this? Hey man.

671
02:40:30,969 --> 02:40:43,959
I'm going to need some eyes. Okay. I need to find Abbott. Wait, can I use his head? Wait,

672
02:40:44,600 --> 02:41:12,709
I need hit. Hey man. Okay. Give me a break. I need to get Abbott's eyes, but how am I going

673
02:41:12,709 --> 02:41:18,010
to bring them over there? I'm not going to be able to bring them over here. Are you serious? I'm

674
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:27,530
going to drag them through the whole level where I'm looking for Abbott. So you tell me I have to

675
02:41:27,530 --> 02:41:48,940
kill Abbott, bring him over, scan his face. Hi there. Take his head. Am I a sicko? What do you,

676
02:41:48,940 --> 02:42:06,680
you want me to take the guy's head off? There's lucky. Yo, I'm going to get that guy's eyes over

677
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:12,739
there. Remember German nine eight five me. I'm the sicko. Right. I'm the fucking weird guy.

678
02:42:13,299 --> 02:42:30,459
He just like cut his head off and bring it with you. Okay. Where is he? Brad low. You didn't see

679
02:42:30,459 --> 02:42:41,299
this. Okay. As far as you're concerned, this never happens. Okay. Where is Abbott? How you doing?

680
02:42:41,299 --> 02:42:59,350
Where are you? I need your head. Abbott. Is that you? What's up? Abbott. How are you doing? Nope.

681
02:42:59,350 --> 02:43:07,379
That's Wakefield. Wait a minute. What about his? What about Abbott's room? Can I go take a pair

682
02:43:07,379 --> 02:43:12,219
of his glasses? Can I take a pic? Wait, there's got to be like a picture of Abbott smiling with

683
02:43:12,219 --> 02:43:24,540
like his son or daughter or something, right? Just take the photo and scan the eyes in the photo.

684
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:45,579
He has to have his own locker room thing, right? Up top. No, Abbott. No, that's Kispert. Have you

685
02:43:45,579 --> 02:43:49,139
heard anything about that? No. Have you heard? We have. Have you heard anything about Abbott?

686
02:43:49,139 --> 02:43:57,260
Do you know where he is? Hey, Connor. Tell him to calm down. Where is he? Hey, if you see Abbott,

687
02:44:02,260 --> 02:44:08,469
well, shit, man. I don't know where he is. I can't relay that message unless I know where he is.

688
02:44:09,979 --> 02:44:16,540
He's the guy behind the wait. It's the guy that's stuck in the door. He's the stuck guy. Oh,

689
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:33,459
well, how do I? Don't do that. They think it's weird and they'll kill you. Okay. He's the guy,

690
02:44:33,459 --> 02:44:40,280
the door stuck guy. All right. All right. All right. I'll go to the door stuck guy to kill all

691
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:47,610
these people. No, I do not have to kill all these people. He's door. Okay. Where was door stuck guy?

692
02:44:47,610 --> 02:45:08,340
This is he's down here, right? No, I don't know. Wrong way. He's down this way. I have to set the

693
02:45:08,340 --> 02:45:19,260
I have to do the alarm first. Are we certain he's in there? Wait, so I have to actually do the alarm

694
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:26,620
first? Why would I? Why would that happen? I'm going to fight my way through everybody. You have

695
02:45:26,620 --> 02:46:08,329
to just start killing people. Okay. All right. I'm going to just do it. God damn it. What's that on

696
02:46:08,329 --> 02:46:49,420
my head? Take the lights out. There we go. All right. Riddick mode. Wait, this is open now.

697
02:46:50,420 --> 02:47:03,590
Oh, this is open. I did it. Did I need to open? I don't even need his eyes.

698
02:47:03,590 --> 02:47:23,459
All the same. First, they tell you how much they need. You didn't even need it when you look away.

699
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:37,159
Anyway, you can take this. Did you get me? Audible is 750 milliliters of cheap alcohol.

700
02:47:37,159 --> 02:47:42,840
I could probably. Hey, man. Long time no see. Leave me alone, man. I'm on duty.

701
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:52,409
You can talk to Jenkins, but you can't talk to me. That's not fair. What's going on? Hey, Bondo. Hey,

702
02:47:52,409 --> 02:47:59,299
where's Abbott? Abbott? Well, he's got the fancy place up there. He's not keen on visitors. Abbott

703
02:47:59,299 --> 02:48:04,819
only answers for his delivery. Whose delivery? What deliveries? Mostly guns. Shipments come

704
02:48:04,819 --> 02:48:19,350
pretty regular like. Okay. He needs, he wants guns. What can I do for you, sir? What do you have to

705
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:24,790
sell? What are you selling? I have only the essentials. Cigarettes and ammunition. Plus I

706
02:48:24,790 --> 02:48:32,299
have a light. I'm a uniform. It's regular. Do I get the uniform? Oh,

707
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:51,610
shotgun. I don't want anything. I'm cool. Okay. Have a good day, sir. Buy the smokes. Buy the

708
02:48:51,610 --> 02:48:58,340
smokes. I don't want cigarettes. Leave me alone, man. I'm on duty. But you're just really falling

709
02:48:58,340 --> 02:49:09,690
apart. No one cares. I, I guess we're going. He hates cigarettes. Yeah. I don't want to buy

710
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:21,129
cigarettes. I don't smoke cigarettes. We're looking for Abbott and we need to deliver some

711
02:49:21,690 --> 02:49:37,000
guns to him. What's happening? Leave me alone. I'm on duty. You have some liquor, huh? I'll give you

712
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:47,940
50 UDs. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Hair of the dog. Should I do that? This whole damn plan just sweats the

713
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:55,860
life out of you. In the last 10 days, four inmates hang themselves on my watch compared to butchers.

714
02:49:55,860 --> 02:50:06,020
The end of a rope. Don't look so bad. Oh, he's personal guard. That's 50 bucks though. That's a

715
02:50:06,020 --> 02:50:23,299
lot. Hey, hey. All right. So let's go over here. He said his door was up here, right?

716
02:50:27,059 --> 02:50:32,100
I've got a hellish shift. 60 hours in the straight. Wipe that smile off your face

717
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:52,309
and leave me alone. Will you? I'm just trying to get information, man. Hey, man. What's going on

718
02:50:52,309 --> 02:51:25,979
in here? Obviously not because he answered the door. Can somebody talk to me? Somebody open the

719
02:51:25,979 --> 02:51:34,340
door. I just want a friend, anybody. I want anyone to open the fucking door. Just give me anything,

720
02:51:34,340 --> 02:51:49,319
please. People must have cameras because they know I'm coming and they just don't like me.

721
02:52:04,979 --> 02:52:11,620
Seems inevitable. They drop one by one. Nobody likes me. At least the bottle doesn't talk back.

722
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:20,389
Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Why would we went up to one on the Australian

723
02:52:20,389 --> 02:52:39,430
floor? Oh, I don't understand. Why are they saying good day? Who butchers? You seen him?

724
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:47,540
No, I just heard what he looks like. Kind of like that guy. Right. Okay. Leave me alone. I'm on duty.

725
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:57,909
Hi there. Kind of like that guy. Okay, that was fun. I guess I'll pick up the weapon case.

726
02:52:59,319 --> 02:53:23,459
I'm on duty. Abbott. Oh, okay. I gotta be ready. I got a package. The door before a door.

727
02:53:24,020 --> 02:53:40,059
Can you believe this guy? Who the fuck's in my apartment? Me. I just, I just buzzed in, man.

728
02:53:41,020 --> 02:53:48,020
Hey, look, I have a package of rifles for you. You just opened the door for me, man.

729
02:53:50,180 --> 02:54:27,540
The person? No. He knows who I am. Okay. Who else is in here? It was a person. I told you it was a

730
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:34,329
person. He's not, he was the clothes.

731
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:51,239
You and I are leaving Butcher Bay. Yeah, what happened to the uniform? Not bad, Johns. Someday

732
02:54:51,239 --> 02:54:57,799
you might just learn how to do this for a living. Going somewhere with my prisoner, Johns?

733
02:54:59,239 --> 02:55:14,100
Oh no, the double, double cross. Well, now what? I should just have him put slugs in both your

734
02:55:14,100 --> 02:55:23,690
heads right now. Thanks, Carmen. It was just a matter of time and I was gonna bring Riddick back to you.

735
02:55:24,409 --> 02:55:35,290
About our agreement, Johns, I'm willing to give you 20% on Riddick. Oh, I'm going to have to fight him in like the pit, right?

736
02:55:36,250 --> 02:55:43,590
Let him answer. Or should we keep negotiating? He's punching him in the fucking stomach. I think he wants to hold up.

737
02:55:46,569 --> 02:55:58,809
22%. I'll take it. What do you say? 22%. Nobody steals my property from my house, Johns.

738
02:55:59,610 --> 02:56:23,959
I'll get them. My slam, Gary. What? Can I get his 22%? I bet on myself. I've got entire regions rioting.

739
02:56:23,959 --> 02:56:31,159
My slam has become a damn war zone. I'm losing men faster than I can replace them and all of this

740
02:56:31,159 --> 02:56:37,000
unrest. Well, it began soon after you arrived, Riddick. 22% of what, by the way? I don't know.

741
02:56:37,079 --> 02:56:45,030
What? It would be a coincidence. Oh, don't sell yourself short. I can see why you

742
02:56:45,030 --> 02:56:52,200
earned your rep. Most killed my second-in-command today. The treasure. Just working my way to the top.

743
02:56:54,860 --> 02:57:05,579
Even more reason for me to bury you deep. I'm sending you to the mine, Riddick. I don't understand

744
02:57:05,579 --> 02:57:13,020
why I let him go. Just shoot him. You'll be the target of every comm, looking to make his bones

745
02:57:13,020 --> 02:57:28,700
with the Achilles. I expect things could get ugly. I'll be disappointed. You're gonna do the

746
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:34,979
rifle in the head, right? And then I'm gonna wake up? No? Wow. They didn't do that. Shit,

747
02:57:34,979 --> 02:57:43,979
that's in every single thing ever made. I'm surprised. I just got a slight push in the

748
02:57:43,979 --> 02:58:21,180
shoulder. I thought it was gonna be, eat this bastard. And you wake up here. Have me? Oh,

749
02:58:21,180 --> 02:59:14,620
fucking Riddick. A different voice actor? Why didn't you run? Riddick's dead. No, there I am.

750
02:59:15,260 --> 02:59:39,459
Always needs transportation, so do I. I'm still alive. Hey, there's the fall joke. He finally

751
02:59:39,459 --> 02:59:49,860
did it. It took him two and a half, three hours. All right, here's the question. Can I get this guy

752
02:59:49,860 --> 03:00:05,860
absolutely riddled with bullets? But they're everywhere. Get inside. I can do this. Wait,

753
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:16,540
we have to all go in here? Shit. Brian, this is really good mime in here. Quiet. Let's watch the

754
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:30,620
show. It didn't give me fucking opportunity to make my YouTube joke. Oh shit, there is no talking.

755
03:00:31,540 --> 03:00:48,420
Oh, I wanted this was gonna just turn and talk. Not now. We'll talk later. Talk to me. Not now.

756
03:00:48,420 --> 03:01:06,780
I'm getting the fuck out of here. You think you can contain Riddick? Big fucking mistake.

757
03:01:07,579 --> 03:01:21,459
What happened to that guy? What are you doing? I don't know. Okay, I have no idea. I have a

758
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:27,239
horrible, horrible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That means if there's

759
03:01:27,239 --> 03:01:34,229
not constant action and constant conflict, I go. I lose my mind. I know some things you'd want to

760
03:01:34,229 --> 03:01:40,329
know. Let's talk in here. Getting out of Max is one thing. After you show above ground, some even

761
03:01:40,329 --> 03:01:46,489
think you're gonna push Jagger Valance down. But double Max is quite another. People are watching

762
03:01:47,049 --> 03:01:53,110
They never see me coming. Tell us too late. Jagger is the one down here.

763
03:01:54,389 --> 03:02:01,700
So far. Point is, this is a super prison underneath the prison. Your double Max home

764
03:02:01,700 --> 03:02:07,860
ends with this hall. Unless you step into the circle and defeat a blue skin. Centurion arranges

765
03:02:07,860 --> 03:02:13,940
all the fights. Talk to him and talk to dog bone. He might help you get down to like a third or

766
03:02:13,940 --> 03:02:32,680
fourth layer. We're gonna get to see the Dante's Inferno of prison structure. Who's this guy?

767
03:02:33,579 --> 03:02:41,079
Centurion. Hey Riddick, let's go. Time to get into the ring. What? Why? Set it up. Sure. A fight

768
03:02:41,079 --> 03:02:48,040
will cost you five UDs. But I'll let you in free. Try not to disappoint. Just send me a victim.

769
03:02:48,040 --> 03:02:55,379
I can't initiate any fights. Slam rules. So you have to find a victim, as you say. I suggest

770
03:02:55,379 --> 03:03:06,360
Herman the blue skin at the gate. How about you? You. You. You. You. You. It's hard to say you.

771
03:03:08,360 --> 03:03:18,870
I don't want any trouble. Stay away. Like that. Like that guy. He's that bad newcomer.

772
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:24,469
It's my dream to work in the mines and meet Jagger Valance.

773
03:03:27,989 --> 03:03:32,229
Hey man, how's it going? Got a med station back here. I'll let you use it if you pay me.

774
03:03:32,229 --> 03:03:42,040
Have to fight this guy? No. No need. Why would I need that? All right, you. Kill you. I get past.

775
03:03:43,559 --> 03:03:50,120
He's always a deeper voice. Let Centurion know. I'm ready to beat the shit out of you.

776
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:53,719
This feels bad. This guy sounds like he's old. Why would I pick the oldest,

777
03:03:53,719 --> 03:04:04,069
weakest, frailest guy in here? They stand better than you.

778
03:04:04,069 --> 03:04:10,020
Great. You have a challenger. Prepare to fight, Riddick. All right, we have a fight.

779
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:12,819
We have a fight. The infamous Riddick against Herman.

780
03:04:17,219 --> 03:04:21,059
The infamous Riddick versus this other guy. Who cares? He's dead.

781
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:26,120
Nobody cares about him. He's fucking guaranteed to die.

782
03:04:41,450 --> 03:04:55,909
Infamous Riddick. The infamous Riddick. Mr. Riddick. What happened? Did I just lose to Herman?

783
03:04:57,879 --> 03:05:11,690
Next time, come ready to fight. I can't. I have to fucking focus.

784
03:05:16,299 --> 03:05:24,250
You can fight again if you want. For free? But don't make me feel sorry for you, Riddick.

785
03:05:24,250 --> 03:05:28,969
Great. You have a challenger. Prepare to fight, Riddick. Why does he keep telling me to fuck off?

786
03:05:28,969 --> 03:05:33,639
All right, we have a fight. We have a fight. The infamous Riddick against Herman.

787
03:05:33,639 --> 03:05:41,209
All bets are off. And remember, 5% goes to Jagger Bell.

788
03:05:41,209 --> 03:05:49,290
Do not step out of the circle. Yeah. Rule two, stay in the circle until one of you is dead.

789
03:05:49,290 --> 03:05:54,329
Hey, rule three, she rule one and two. Where's the fucking comedy? You had an opportunity.

790
03:06:05,049 --> 03:06:15,799
Out of the circle. He went out of the circle. You may have survived this time, Riddick,

791
03:06:15,799 --> 03:06:19,559
but to get somewhere, you're gonna have to fight and win.

792
03:06:19,559 --> 03:06:35,670
I did win. Oh, he's dead. He's dead. So, what, I just keep killing people down here?

793
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:42,489
Five bucks, and I'll suggest a new fighter. You win the show, you're 20 bucks richer.

794
03:06:42,489 --> 03:06:48,329
Yeah. Bring me the next one. Next is Basim. You'll find him in the courtyard.

795
03:07:11,639 --> 03:07:24,090
I am? I didn't do anything. What, I can't like wave my fucking arms around? What if I-

796
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:30,649
I'm gonna get so sick of this shit. Don't wave your arms around in front of the cameras.

797
03:07:34,229 --> 03:07:49,420
Feed ward. No fucking in recreation area? What? What is that? There's like a fucking bug in here.

798
03:07:50,059 --> 03:08:13,350
Come here. I'm trying to catch the fucking bugs. Just hide for a second. Okay, we're good.

799
03:08:18,860 --> 03:08:23,829
Listen, Cricket's got the best sheaves you can buy. Okay, thanks.

800
03:08:24,469 --> 03:08:31,059
I got a custom-made bloody sharp sheave. Cuts through a belly like a soft-boiled egg.

801
03:08:31,860 --> 03:08:40,379
30 bucks? I'll take it. I'll take it. Here, take care, man. I'll see. Take the cash and

802
03:08:40,379 --> 03:08:47,270
hide it in the usual place. Nice. Okay, don't take that out. Somebody will see it.

803
03:08:50,579 --> 03:09:02,420
Where's this person I'm supposed to be? I didn't do anything. Wait, am I about-

804
03:09:06,940 --> 03:09:13,850
He's clean. How? Where is it? Get out of here. Where is the ship?

805
03:09:15,510 --> 03:09:21,030
That's the question that you need to ask. Where is the ship?

806
03:09:24,229 --> 03:09:42,360
No, don't do it again. Look here. He's not gonna find it this time, right? He's clean. Get out of

807
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:49,959
here. I so badly want to take it out and just be like, haha, you missed it. Where's this guy?

808
03:09:49,959 --> 03:09:57,260
There's a person here I'm supposed to be fighting. Didn't he say he was out in the

809
03:09:58,299 --> 03:10:14,329
courtyard or something? I didn't see anybody. Aha, you missed it. Yeah. Hey, when does the

810
03:10:14,329 --> 03:10:29,139
prison level end? After about 10 to 12 hours, I think. Hey, guys. Look what I smuggled in here.

811
03:10:47,239 --> 03:10:51,319
Hey, I swear on my mother. Look what he's gonna fucking punch the bullets out of the air.

812
03:10:52,520 --> 03:10:58,360
I ain't bullshitting, Trico. I promise it's true. Wait, which one of you guys wants to fight me?

813
03:10:58,360 --> 03:11:04,840
You got a problem, huh? Hey, I do. So, Reno's blessings don't come free. $20? We gotta release

814
03:11:04,840 --> 03:11:10,760
from the guard with the names of some snitches. Let some asshole grab them. Okay. I want to know

815
03:11:10,760 --> 03:11:21,879
who. And I want that. Oh, boy. Okay. I'm like pants down. Also, he discovered the mind.

816
03:11:22,360 --> 03:11:29,479
This is like fucking pants are down. Sure, I'll do it. I'll find anything. I'll let you know.

817
03:11:29,479 --> 03:11:35,639
I'm trying to explain. Relax. Sorry, Holmes. Anyway, this guy, he like discovered the mind.

818
03:11:35,639 --> 03:11:40,760
Who would I define somebody that stole the list? Toto Cuellas is in charge here.

819
03:11:40,760 --> 03:11:44,680
Get out of here, maestro. Cuellas is our man. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.

820
03:11:44,680 --> 03:11:48,600
Get out of here, maestro. Toto Cuellas is our man. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.

821
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:51,719
Toto Cuellas is in charge here. They talk to Cuellas, all right? He runs the show.

822
03:11:51,719 --> 03:12:10,629
Um, everything is to talk to you. Okay. I guess I gotta go over here. Talk to Cuellas.

823
03:12:15,180 --> 03:12:20,469
Hey. All right. Where is this guy? I want to fight the dude. Wait, do you have a secret list?

824
03:12:21,190 --> 03:12:23,829
Stay away from me. I got the important stuff.

825
03:12:28,139 --> 03:12:31,020
Who has the list? Do you have a list on you? I need a list.

826
03:12:34,899 --> 03:12:44,680
I want you to talk. Hey, guys. Hey, man. You want to buy a few smokes?

827
03:12:44,680 --> 03:12:47,690
I can sell you a pack of smokes. Sure, I'll take a pack of smokes.

828
03:12:47,690 --> 03:12:49,690
Or maybe you need some info on them. For free.

829
03:12:53,129 --> 03:12:56,680
What do you know? What do you know I know now?

830
03:12:56,680 --> 03:13:00,920
There's a big mining area underneath us, right? It's off limits to everyone.

831
03:13:00,920 --> 03:13:07,079
But Jagger Valance is down there, so I hear. Section D is an entrance, if you want to take a

832
03:13:07,079 --> 03:13:14,200
look. And if you want something other than smokes, say hello to Monster in the diner.

833
03:13:14,200 --> 03:13:17,479
Good link. And about, yeah, it's been 20 minutes.

834
03:13:22,629 --> 03:13:27,379
This is not even me, though. You know what I mean? This is not even me.

835
03:13:28,020 --> 03:13:59,190
This is just, it's just Riddick holding these. All right. Yeah, who knows what's going on here?

836
03:14:00,149 --> 03:14:02,549
Okay, who knows? You know, I can kill it.

837
03:14:03,989 --> 03:14:07,690
Why did I miss it? Stop, I'm not. Wait, this is the guy.

838
03:14:07,690 --> 03:14:12,100
So you want to fight me? That's good, because I can use the prize money.

839
03:14:13,139 --> 03:14:16,180
See you in the ring, punk. Can I stab this guy in the ring?

840
03:14:17,139 --> 03:14:22,489
All right, I'm ready. I see you in the ring.

841
03:14:22,489 --> 03:14:34,940
Okay, stay back. I need to get him, but there's no way

842
03:14:34,940 --> 03:14:38,139
I can get the ship through. There's an old trick you can use.

843
03:14:38,860 --> 03:14:42,139
You have an old style filter smoke and a lighter.

844
03:14:42,139 --> 03:14:46,139
I'm going to smoke the bitch to death? No, you dumb fuck.

845
03:14:47,819 --> 03:14:51,659
You burn the filter and work it into a needle. It's kind of fragile,

846
03:14:51,659 --> 03:14:55,579
so you don't want to work it too much. Stab him in the neck and he's done, man.

847
03:14:56,379 --> 03:15:06,180
Shit, I heard of that thing, of course. That's what I'm going to do.

848
03:15:06,180 --> 03:15:16,629
Kind of like that. I did it wrong. I didn't even do it right.

849
03:15:16,629 --> 03:15:18,870
I was supposed to stab him in the neck and I stabbed him in the ass.

850
03:15:18,870 --> 03:15:21,989
I need to get him, but there's no way I can get the ship through.

851
03:15:21,989 --> 03:15:24,840
There's an old- I've never seen you before.

852
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:30,870
Want to make an impression? There are two PPE members in section A of the courtyard.

853
03:15:30,870 --> 03:15:35,350
Two PPE members? Those bastards stole the red tube that they

854
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:40,389
really need. Find out where they stashed it and bring it to me.

855
03:15:40,389 --> 03:15:43,670
Okay, I'll pay you. Okay.

856
03:15:44,950 --> 03:15:50,040
I'll check it out. All right, I have way too many quests.

857
03:15:51,989 --> 03:15:54,469
Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice? Yes.

858
03:15:56,180 --> 03:16:02,549
Bet five on two, bet five- where's bet 50? Pay off 16 to one.

859
03:16:02,549 --> 03:16:06,229
All right, bet five UDs on 11. 16 to one.

860
03:16:06,229 --> 03:16:09,270
Give me the yellow. Okay, let's roll the dice.

861
03:16:14,200 --> 03:16:22,520
It's high llama. Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice?

862
03:16:22,520 --> 03:16:29,700
Yes. Two or 12. On aces and boxcars.

863
03:16:30,260 --> 03:16:34,680
Okay, let's roll the dice. Here comes a 12 right there, double sixes.

864
03:16:37,110 --> 03:16:43,450
Is any craps or ace deuce? You lose, man.

865
03:16:43,450 --> 03:16:52,459
Hey man, want to try your luck with the dice? Take the ace deuce.

866
03:16:52,459 --> 03:16:54,780
16. Okay, let's roll the dice.

867
03:16:58,760 --> 03:17:03,879
Bingo. Bingo! Bingo! Bingo!

868
03:17:05,959 --> 03:17:14,680
What? I didn't pick 12?

869
03:17:22,920 --> 03:17:27,079
You're Riddick, yeah? Heard you pulled off some stunts in the circle.

870
03:17:27,799 --> 03:17:31,479
Say, you got a mining job? Nobody wants me to do something for them.

871
03:17:31,479 --> 03:17:33,719
Need one. Impossible.

872
03:17:33,719 --> 03:17:38,940
Unless you get assigned by the warden. Reason I ask is because I want to know if

873
03:17:38,940 --> 03:17:44,139
Jagger Balance is still around. I almost feel like that every single

874
03:17:44,139 --> 03:17:47,739
character in this game is doing a Vin Diesel impression.

875
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:53,270
They were told that in the voice acting booth.

876
03:17:58,090 --> 03:18:01,209
If that's true, that's awesome. That's hysterical. I hope that's the case.

877
03:18:06,250 --> 03:18:10,969
Hey man, how about you help me collect some debts and I'll lend you money.

878
03:18:11,610 --> 03:18:15,819
I heard you're a pretty good fighter. Who owes you?

879
03:18:16,620 --> 03:18:22,219
Binks. One of the K3 guys in the diner. But you can't do him with muscles.

880
03:18:22,219 --> 03:18:24,379
I'm running. I have so many missions to do.

881
03:18:24,379 --> 03:18:26,379
Drop it in Binks food. But don't kill him.

882
03:18:26,379 --> 03:18:29,180
Get some poison? I'm the sender of that message.

883
03:18:29,500 --> 03:18:33,180
All right. So I have to put poison in somebody's food.

884
03:18:33,180 --> 03:18:36,299
Fight a guy. How many missions do I have? Okay.

885
03:18:37,260 --> 03:18:42,389
Go talk to Dogbone. Go beat up the fighter.

886
03:18:43,770 --> 03:18:47,049
Find out who took the list. Find the red tube.

887
03:18:48,250 --> 03:18:52,579
Where Jagger Balance is. And poison a guy.

888
03:18:54,819 --> 03:18:58,020
Okay. Uh, I'm going to go over here. Bye.

889
03:18:58,979 --> 03:19:02,649
You know the vents go all over this place.

890
03:19:03,719 --> 03:19:08,040
There's one that goes from the dying hall over to Zoda's land in tower 19.

891
03:19:09,239 --> 03:19:13,319
Anyway, Padilla, the crazy mother. Hey, do you want anything?

892
03:19:14,040 --> 03:19:18,459
The mines. Tell me everything you know.

893
03:19:18,459 --> 03:19:21,739
You really want to go down there? Like Jagger Balance?

894
03:19:22,299 --> 03:19:26,219
That's why I asked. There's a door beside the work pass

895
03:19:26,219 --> 03:19:30,700
checkpoint. This guy locked. The only ones that have a key are the guards.

896
03:19:30,700 --> 03:19:34,379
The all-ranking ones. Traffic. If you can manage a one-on-one with an officer.

897
03:19:35,340 --> 03:19:40,219
One-on-one with an officer. And this Jagger Balance, he a problem?

898
03:19:40,219 --> 03:19:46,860
Why is Riddick Brooks so small? He kind of does. He actually kind of does look pretty little.

899
03:19:46,860 --> 03:19:50,059
You're right. I haven't even noticed that the whole time.

900
03:19:54,860 --> 03:20:00,299
Hey, homie. You want to trade drugs? All right. Do me a favor.

901
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:03,350
Okay. Tell me more.

902
03:20:03,350 --> 03:20:08,790
Okay. I need your help on two things, man. First, I need my injector back from the PPPs.

903
03:20:08,790 --> 03:20:11,989
Look, Gulag has some history with him. He'll tell you more.

904
03:20:11,989 --> 03:20:17,430
Second, Basim is really bumming me out. So I need you to waste him in the ring for me.

905
03:20:17,430 --> 03:20:19,030
What are you going to do? How about it, man?

906
03:20:19,030 --> 03:20:23,180
Let's go. I can do it. I'm already going to do that.

907
03:20:23,180 --> 03:20:26,379
What? You want to front me? I am Sorrenos.

908
03:20:26,379 --> 03:20:29,500
You want to see the PPPs? Check the A section.

909
03:20:30,459 --> 03:20:42,819
All right. PPPs. I think I have enough stuff to do. Work? What's this? Work pass?

910
03:20:43,459 --> 03:20:56,840
I have to go to the diner, don't I? Wait, I actually have to do work?

911
03:20:57,639 --> 03:21:01,850
I'm not going to help you get down to the mines, if that's what you want.

912
03:21:02,649 --> 03:21:06,170
It's impossible. The mines. I need to get to them.

913
03:21:07,049 --> 03:21:11,049
You should talk to Flores in the courtyard. I just worked on it.

914
03:21:11,129 --> 03:21:12,969
I didn't just say you can't do anything?

915
03:21:12,969 --> 03:21:15,530
Just go off my glass and I'll be damned if I didn't forget my glasses.

916
03:21:15,530 --> 03:21:20,809
If you're going down there, could you check around the big elevator in Upper Mines?

917
03:21:22,090 --> 03:21:24,010
Sure, let's just do everything.

918
03:21:27,530 --> 03:21:35,340
You have a quest? Oh! I just want to see if this guy has a mission to do. My God.

919
03:21:47,930 --> 03:21:52,709
I don't know the code. I'm supposed to know every code.

920
03:21:56,090 --> 03:21:58,250
I'm so bad they want to stab this thing in the back.

921
03:21:58,729 --> 03:22:08,219
Do I know the code for this door? Okay, I'm not fucking around with this guy.

922
03:22:09,260 --> 03:22:16,569
I have so many missions, I have no idea what they are.

923
03:22:16,569 --> 03:22:19,290
I'm just going to walk around and aimlessly try to figure out one of them.

924
03:22:20,090 --> 03:22:28,299
We have to go to the dining hall. I have to fight the guy in the circle,

925
03:22:28,299 --> 03:22:33,959
go to the dining hall, poison a guy, get the red vial, talk to Gulag.

926
03:22:36,229 --> 03:22:40,780
Where's Gulag? I don't even know.

927
03:22:41,899 --> 03:22:43,500
Three people want me to kill two people.

928
03:22:46,780 --> 03:22:50,840
I don't know where they stashed it, but maybe you can find a way to get it.

929
03:22:52,200 --> 03:22:53,399
Okay, right. Now...

930
03:22:55,260 --> 03:22:57,020
Hey man, want to try your luck with...

931
03:22:57,659 --> 03:23:02,790
Give me the yellow.

932
03:23:03,510 --> 03:23:05,270
Okay, let's roll the dice.

933
03:23:05,989 --> 03:23:10,280
Let's go.

934
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:12,200
It's 11 or high limelight.

935
03:23:12,200 --> 03:23:14,200
That's fucking, that's 16 to 1.

936
03:23:14,200 --> 03:23:14,700
You win.

937
03:23:15,799 --> 03:23:19,159
How much money does this guy's got? What, it's 5 bucks? 16 to 1?

938
03:23:20,180 --> 03:23:22,420
I just made it all back. And then some. See you later.

939
03:23:23,379 --> 03:23:30,870
All right, I could fight that guy. I got to go back this way.

940
03:23:31,590 --> 03:23:38,620
I want to go to the dining hall, but I want to fight somebody in the circle.

941
03:23:38,620 --> 03:23:39,819
Where is this? Here he is.

942
03:23:39,819 --> 03:23:40,780
All right, let's go. I'm ready.

943
03:23:41,659 --> 03:23:42,379
No, it's not you.

944
03:23:49,690 --> 03:23:51,129
Gamble more feed ward.

945
03:23:51,129 --> 03:23:52,969
All right, wait, wait, wait. I want to go here.

946
03:23:52,969 --> 03:24:02,340
Fight the dude? I will. I just want to see in here.

947
03:24:02,340 --> 03:24:08,100
All right, how do I like actually go in the feed ward?

948
03:24:08,100 --> 03:24:08,600
Here we go.

949
03:24:09,299 --> 03:24:17,979
All right.

950
03:24:21,219 --> 03:24:24,409
Who the fuck is this guy?

951
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:35,899
Does he have to kill him?

952
03:24:36,700 --> 03:24:45,100
Okay, nobody cares, right?

953
03:24:45,659 --> 03:24:47,799
Oh, I got poison.

954
03:24:50,180 --> 03:24:51,700
Poison is food. Poison is food.

955
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:53,059
Poison is food. Poison is food.

956
03:24:55,610 --> 03:24:56,409
Is that the guy?

957
03:24:56,409 --> 03:24:57,450
Whose food do I poison?

958
03:24:58,010 --> 03:25:02,459
Is this guy?

959
03:25:15,180 --> 03:25:15,680
Okay.

960
03:25:20,899 --> 03:25:23,059
Hey, by the way, can I tell you?

961
03:25:23,059 --> 03:25:28,860
The slop is delicious today.

962
03:25:28,860 --> 03:25:31,290
Fuck off, man. We're busy.

963
03:25:31,290 --> 03:25:32,649
Fuck off, man. We're busy.

964
03:25:43,260 --> 03:25:44,379
He's still, he's gone.

965
03:25:46,260 --> 03:25:48,659
Hey, look, this is your food right over here.

966
03:25:48,659 --> 03:25:49,379
It's so good.

967
03:26:02,409 --> 03:26:04,489
This is eat. This is your food over here.

968
03:26:06,500 --> 03:26:09,299
Eat, eat, eat, eat.

969
03:26:09,299 --> 03:26:10,979
Fuck off, man. We're busy.

970
03:26:10,979 --> 03:26:11,479
Eat.

971
03:26:24,280 --> 03:26:25,319
He's so busy.

972
03:26:25,319 --> 03:26:27,799
He's practicing whatever moonwalking.

973
03:26:27,799 --> 03:26:28,600
I don't know what he's doing.

974
03:26:29,819 --> 03:26:30,780
He'll eventually get there.

975
03:26:30,780 --> 03:26:31,659
Well, can I talk to anybody else?

976
03:26:31,659 --> 03:26:32,540
Hey, get lost.

977
03:26:32,540 --> 03:26:33,659
Nobody likes me, right?

978
03:26:33,659 --> 03:26:35,340
You want some free advice, buddy?

979
03:26:35,340 --> 03:26:37,899
If you're carrying something, stay away from the guards in the yard.

980
03:26:37,899 --> 03:26:39,260
They'll set you without a second thought.

981
03:26:39,260 --> 03:26:42,139
Oh, he's eating the wrong food.

982
03:26:50,569 --> 03:26:52,709
He's ate somebody else's food.

983
03:26:58,139 --> 03:26:59,340
That's not even the poison one.

984
03:26:59,340 --> 03:27:00,860
I think this guy just feels bad.

985
03:27:12,649 --> 03:27:16,780
Tell him, tell him I'll pay back his debt.

986
03:27:16,780 --> 03:27:17,899
Quest completed.

987
03:27:21,459 --> 03:27:24,420
Dinah's closed, but life could be worse.

988
03:27:25,379 --> 03:27:26,659
What's on your mind?

989
03:27:26,659 --> 03:27:30,420
What are you trading?

990
03:27:30,420 --> 03:27:31,700
Not much today.

991
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:34,100
I got a vent tool, a club, and a shiv.

992
03:27:34,739 --> 03:27:35,540
All custom made.

993
03:27:35,540 --> 03:27:36,500
I'll take a vent tool.

994
03:27:37,459 --> 03:27:39,290
A vent tool.

995
03:27:39,290 --> 03:27:40,250
Use it well.

996
03:27:40,250 --> 03:27:41,209
I'll also take...

997
03:27:41,209 --> 03:27:42,329
I only have a shiv.

998
03:27:42,329 --> 03:27:43,049
I'll take a club.

999
03:27:43,049 --> 03:27:44,090
And a club.

1000
03:27:44,090 --> 03:27:44,809
A club?

1001
03:27:46,409 --> 03:27:47,370
I'll take the club.

1002
03:27:47,370 --> 03:27:47,930
It's 50 bucks.

1003
03:27:47,930 --> 03:27:48,889
Here it is.

1004
03:27:48,889 --> 03:27:50,649
I'm gonna use my gambling winnings on something.

1005
03:27:52,520 --> 03:27:53,959
Oh, dude, I got a fucking club.

1006
03:27:58,260 --> 03:28:01,620
I just wanted to look at it.

1007
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:06,420
How do we do that transaction is what I want to know.

1008
03:28:07,299 --> 03:28:09,299
So I can't look at it, but he can hand it to me.

1009
03:28:11,239 --> 03:28:12,280
Oh, god damn it.

1010
03:28:12,920 --> 03:28:34,549
This is for killing Harman.

1011
03:28:36,920 --> 03:28:38,229
Yeah, but I have a knife.

1012
03:28:39,110 --> 03:28:39,670
Big mistake.

1013
03:28:41,190 --> 03:28:48,569
How come there are no cameras over here?

1014
03:28:50,250 --> 03:28:57,299
Stop following me.

1015
03:28:57,299 --> 03:28:59,139
I got important stuff to stop.

1016
03:29:03,379 --> 03:29:04,819
Holy shit, that's a lot of money.

1017
03:29:05,909 --> 03:29:06,790
Wait, the...

1018
03:29:06,790 --> 03:29:07,670
This is the...

1019
03:29:07,670 --> 03:29:08,389
I got the...

1020
03:29:08,389 --> 03:29:09,350
I got the map.

1021
03:29:09,350 --> 03:29:09,909
All right, let's go.

1022
03:29:25,909 --> 03:29:30,950
Hey, get lost.

1023
03:29:30,950 --> 03:29:32,629
You want some free advice, buddy?

1024
03:29:32,629 --> 03:29:34,469
If you're carrying something, stay away from the guards

1025
03:29:34,469 --> 03:29:35,190
in the yard.

1026
03:29:35,190 --> 03:29:36,629
They'll set you without a second thought.

1027
03:29:36,629 --> 03:29:37,350
I can blast it.

1028
03:29:38,569 --> 03:29:40,489
Hey, I'm from fucking Boston.

1029
03:29:40,489 --> 03:29:41,290
God, gods.

1030
03:29:42,170 --> 03:29:43,290
Get those gods out of the yard.

1031
03:29:47,899 --> 03:29:49,579
All right, now I'm not gonna bother him or anything.

1032
03:29:49,579 --> 03:29:50,700
He'll just go right for it, right?

1033
03:29:54,659 --> 03:29:55,700
All right, here we go.

1034
03:29:58,969 --> 03:30:00,010
It's gonna be so hard.

1035
03:30:01,290 --> 03:30:02,729
Never mind, let's go.

1036
03:30:02,729 --> 03:30:05,579
Just get away.

1037
03:30:05,579 --> 03:30:06,059
He'll do it.

1038
03:30:06,059 --> 03:30:06,620
Turn your back.

1039
03:30:06,620 --> 03:30:09,899
He'll do it in one, two, three.

1040
03:30:09,899 --> 03:30:10,399
No.

1041
03:30:12,870 --> 03:30:13,370
What?

1042
03:30:13,370 --> 03:30:15,340
What detected?

1043
03:30:15,979 --> 03:30:25,590
Out of here.

1044
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:27,190
Motherfucker.

1045
03:30:27,190 --> 03:30:27,989
Who's saying that?

1046
03:30:27,989 --> 03:30:30,149
All right, sit down and eat, please, so I can move on.

1047
03:30:36,010 --> 03:30:37,290
Eat your food.

1048
03:30:38,649 --> 03:30:39,450
Fuck off, man.

1049
03:30:39,450 --> 03:30:40,010
We're busy.

1050
03:31:42,219 --> 03:31:44,219
Eat the fucking breakfast, man.

1051
03:31:45,319 --> 03:31:46,680
Sit down and eat, please.

1052
03:31:46,680 --> 03:31:47,399
Fuck off, man.

1053
03:31:47,399 --> 03:31:47,959
We're busy.

1054
03:31:47,959 --> 03:31:48,440
Eat this.

1055
03:31:48,440 --> 03:31:48,840
Sit down.

1056
03:31:48,840 --> 03:31:50,360
Wait, somebody else is eating his food.

1057
03:31:50,360 --> 03:31:51,319
Hey, get lost.

1058
03:31:58,420 --> 03:32:01,299
That's where they take you if they don't want witnesses.

1059
03:32:01,299 --> 03:32:03,219
No surveillance there, man.

1060
03:32:03,219 --> 03:32:03,700
Nothing.

1061
03:32:03,700 --> 03:32:04,659
For you, watching...

1062
03:32:04,659 --> 03:32:05,459
No surveillance.

1063
03:32:05,459 --> 03:32:05,959
Hmm.

1064
03:32:21,399 --> 03:32:26,120
I don't even know who this guy is.

1065
03:32:30,250 --> 03:32:30,729
No.

1066
03:32:30,729 --> 03:32:37,530
Hey, sit down and fucking eat before I get bored and start killing everybody in here, man.

1067
03:32:40,170 --> 03:32:43,129
Dinah's closed, but life could be worse.

1068
03:32:44,090 --> 03:32:45,909
What's on your mind?

1069
03:32:45,909 --> 03:32:47,909
I would like, uh, love if I could have...

1070
03:32:47,909 --> 03:32:48,870
Not much today.

1071
03:32:48,870 --> 03:32:49,190
Event tool.

1072
03:32:49,190 --> 03:32:51,510
I got event tool, a club, and a shiv.

1073
03:32:52,149 --> 03:32:53,110
All custom made.

1074
03:32:53,670 --> 03:32:56,170
Event tool.

1075
03:32:56,170 --> 03:32:58,170
What did you say about killing all the NPCs?

1076
03:32:58,170 --> 03:32:58,889
I know.

1077
03:32:58,889 --> 03:32:59,690
I know.

1078
03:32:59,690 --> 03:33:01,930
I only have a shiv and a club.

1079
03:33:05,559 --> 03:33:06,600
He's soft locked.

1080
03:33:09,620 --> 03:33:10,420
I don't think he is.

1081
03:33:11,219 --> 03:33:21,059
Is he soft locked for real?

1082
03:33:22,940 --> 03:33:23,739
Fuck off, man.

1083
03:33:23,739 --> 03:33:24,299
We're busy.

1084
03:33:25,899 --> 03:33:26,700
Fuck off, man.

1085
03:33:26,700 --> 03:33:27,500
We're busy.

1086
03:33:27,500 --> 03:33:28,540
I can't club him.

1087
03:33:29,979 --> 03:33:39,270
How did two people die back here?

1088
03:33:39,270 --> 03:33:40,549
I didn't kill two people, did I?

1089
03:33:41,750 --> 03:33:42,309
Want a trade?

1090
03:33:42,950 --> 03:33:45,510
Me and Monster run the trade market in Butcher Bay.

1091
03:33:45,510 --> 03:33:46,389
He's got the goods.

1092
03:33:46,950 --> 03:33:47,909
I gots the smokes.

1093
03:33:50,659 --> 03:33:51,940
Tell me about Monster.

1094
03:33:52,500 --> 03:33:54,979
Yeah, he's running goods from his spot in the diner.

1095
03:33:54,979 --> 03:33:56,260
He's probably in there with Chang.

1096
03:33:57,670 --> 03:33:58,790
So, what do you say?

1097
03:33:58,790 --> 03:33:59,590
How about some smoke?

1098
03:33:59,590 --> 03:34:01,270
Yeah, I'm like...

1099
03:34:01,270 --> 03:34:02,309
Give me the smokes.

1100
03:34:02,870 --> 03:34:04,149
Okay, here you go.

1101
03:34:05,190 --> 03:34:09,129
Ooh, good trade.

1102
03:34:40,459 --> 03:34:43,020
Come back when you have the whole snitch list.

1103
03:34:43,020 --> 03:34:43,579
I've got it.

1104
03:34:44,540 --> 03:34:48,940
Don't I have the snitch list?

1105
03:34:52,059 --> 03:34:52,620
Map.

1106
03:34:52,620 --> 03:34:55,420
This map shows the location of the secret stash

1107
03:34:55,420 --> 03:34:57,819
far back of the feed board behind a loose panel.

1108
03:34:58,620 --> 03:34:58,940
Really?

1109
03:35:13,670 --> 03:35:14,389
Loose panel?

1110
03:35:22,040 --> 03:35:23,959
Far back behind a loose panel.

1111
03:35:27,219 --> 03:35:30,659
Ah, and there it is.

1112
03:35:31,459 --> 03:35:36,579
And I've got a protractor and I got fake Halloween blood.

1113
03:35:37,299 --> 03:35:38,459
What is this stuff?

1114
03:35:39,989 --> 03:35:41,989
The tube that was stolen from Gulag.

1115
03:35:41,989 --> 03:35:42,950
Injector.

1116
03:35:42,950 --> 03:35:45,190
A syringe used by some drug addict.

1117
03:35:51,979 --> 03:35:52,700
He's not gonna eat.

1118
03:35:53,340 --> 03:35:55,879
Step away, okay?

1119
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:58,569
I've done my rounds anyway.

1120
03:35:58,569 --> 03:36:02,950
I feel like get him out of his animation loop he's in.

1121
03:36:03,750 --> 03:36:04,469
I can't punch him.

1122
03:36:04,469 --> 03:36:05,190
I'm gonna get attacked.

1123
03:36:05,909 --> 03:36:07,319
I'm gonna reload the area.

1124
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:17,879
Hey, look what I got.

1125
03:36:17,879 --> 03:36:20,440
Come back when you have the whole snitch list.

1126
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:27,739
All right, I'm gonna come back.

1127
03:36:27,739 --> 03:36:47,690
You want me to actually softlock.

1128
03:36:47,690 --> 03:36:49,209
Your entire game is gonna be ruined.

1129
03:36:49,209 --> 03:36:49,709
What?

1130
03:36:52,010 --> 03:36:52,649
Where?

1131
03:36:52,649 --> 03:36:53,770
Fisher too?

1132
03:36:53,770 --> 03:36:54,270
Don't know.

1133
03:36:55,209 --> 03:37:02,659
No, these guys are all still dead.

1134
03:37:04,069 --> 03:37:05,670
No, he's just not gonna sit down and eat.

1135
03:37:08,469 --> 03:37:09,270
Fuck off, man.

1136
03:37:09,270 --> 03:37:09,829
We're busy.

1137
03:37:16,729 --> 03:37:17,690
Wait, he's moving.

1138
03:37:18,649 --> 03:37:19,659
Okay, hold on.

1139
03:37:19,659 --> 03:37:20,139
He turned.

1140
03:37:20,700 --> 03:37:26,780
Go talk to the nurse.

1141
03:37:29,799 --> 03:37:30,760
Hey, get lost.

1142
03:37:31,559 --> 03:37:36,739
Just kill him?

1143
03:37:36,739 --> 03:37:37,139
I can't.

1144
03:37:37,780 --> 03:37:38,500
I can't kill him.

1145
03:37:39,299 --> 03:37:42,360
All right, well, I'm gonna go turn in this shit.

1146
03:37:42,360 --> 03:37:42,680
Whatever.

1147
03:37:42,680 --> 03:37:44,440
If I can't do all the quests, who cares?

1148
03:37:45,159 --> 03:37:49,540
I can come back.

1149
03:37:49,540 --> 03:37:55,260
So I have the...

1150
03:37:55,260 --> 03:37:56,540
I gotta go talk to Gulag.

1151
03:37:57,260 --> 03:38:01,590
All right, what we got?

1152
03:38:01,590 --> 03:38:02,790
I got at least a few items.

1153
03:38:03,670 --> 03:38:06,500
I've got the PPP stash.

1154
03:38:07,850 --> 03:38:08,350
Got.

1155
03:38:11,590 --> 03:38:12,309
All right, who do I...

1156
03:38:12,309 --> 03:38:12,629
Who...

1157
03:38:12,629 --> 03:38:13,190
Where are you?

1158
03:38:15,459 --> 03:38:15,959
You?

1159
03:38:16,920 --> 03:38:17,559
Hey, Riddick.

1160
03:38:17,559 --> 03:38:18,520
You wanna buy smokes?

1161
03:38:19,260 --> 03:38:20,219
If not, I can't.

1162
03:38:21,100 --> 03:38:23,450
No.

1163
03:38:23,450 --> 03:38:24,170
Get lost.

1164
03:38:24,170 --> 03:38:24,670
Where is he?

1165
03:38:25,899 --> 03:38:28,620
Show me some proof that all the blue skins are gone

1166
03:38:28,620 --> 03:38:29,979
and I'll give you a reward.

1167
03:38:29,979 --> 03:38:30,479
Um...

1168
03:38:31,260 --> 03:38:31,760
Okay.

1169
03:38:36,280 --> 03:38:37,719
I see you in the rain.

1170
03:38:40,520 --> 03:38:41,020
Okay.

1171
03:38:44,649 --> 03:38:45,610
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1172
03:38:45,610 --> 03:38:46,809
You just made my day.

1173
03:38:47,530 --> 03:38:48,889
Here, take this.

1174
03:38:50,010 --> 03:38:52,489
Ooh, a whole lot of nothing.

1175
03:38:54,540 --> 03:38:55,040
Hey, man.

1176
03:38:59,690 --> 03:39:00,329
Good work.

1177
03:39:00,329 --> 03:39:01,850
I got the money back from Binks.

1178
03:39:02,409 --> 03:39:03,530
Hey, here's a little bonus.

1179
03:39:04,170 --> 03:39:05,209
Now, if you need...

1180
03:39:05,209 --> 03:39:05,850
I don't want any.

1181
03:39:05,850 --> 03:39:06,569
I want money.

1182
03:39:06,569 --> 03:39:08,090
Feel free to ask any time.

1183
03:39:08,090 --> 03:39:09,370
I'll loan you interest free.

1184
03:39:11,129 --> 03:39:14,360
If you need money, feel free to ask any time.

1185
03:39:14,360 --> 03:39:15,319
I'll loan you interest free.

1186
03:39:15,319 --> 03:39:16,600
How about I just don't pay it back?

1187
03:39:17,829 --> 03:39:20,709
Got more than 10, so I don't borrow anything.

1188
03:39:23,899 --> 03:39:25,020
Not interested.

1189
03:39:25,819 --> 03:39:28,790
Okay.

1190
03:39:28,790 --> 03:39:29,350
Well, that's quite...

1191
03:39:29,350 --> 03:39:30,229
What else do I have to turn in?

1192
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:34,569
Okay.

1193
03:39:34,569 --> 03:39:35,690
Speak to Dogbone.

1194
03:39:36,649 --> 03:39:39,590
Go back to Centurion and he'll start the fight.

1195
03:39:40,469 --> 03:39:42,950
A list from a guard.

1196
03:39:42,950 --> 03:39:43,450
Okay.

1197
03:39:45,909 --> 03:39:46,629
That's that.

1198
03:39:46,629 --> 03:39:47,430
Get drug.

1199
03:39:47,430 --> 03:39:48,069
Okay.

1200
03:39:48,069 --> 03:39:50,469
Two-Tong won't deal unless you do two things for him.

1201
03:39:50,469 --> 03:39:53,110
Get his injector back and defeat the guy in the ring.

1202
03:39:53,110 --> 03:39:54,149
All right, we have the injector.

1203
03:39:55,270 --> 03:39:56,149
Where's Two-Tong?

1204
03:39:58,520 --> 03:39:59,020
I'm good.

1205
03:39:59,719 --> 03:40:00,219
You?

1206
03:40:02,040 --> 03:40:06,500
Two-Tong.

1207
03:40:06,500 --> 03:40:07,379
He's in here, isn't he?

1208
03:40:08,940 --> 03:40:09,440
Hey, look.

1209
03:40:10,620 --> 03:40:11,420
Thanks, dude.

1210
03:40:12,219 --> 03:40:15,180
You don't know how much I needed this.

1211
03:40:15,180 --> 03:40:16,540
Now beat the guy up.

1212
03:40:16,540 --> 03:40:19,420
Now I just need Basim host and we'll have smooth sailing.

1213
03:40:20,139 --> 03:40:23,180
Hey, waste him in the ring for me, would you?

1214
03:40:24,860 --> 03:40:25,739
Oh, shit.

1215
03:40:27,129 --> 03:40:28,250
What, you want to front me?

1216
03:40:28,889 --> 03:40:29,770
I am so ready.

1217
03:40:29,770 --> 03:40:31,690
You want to see the PPPs?

1218
03:40:33,209 --> 03:40:34,729
All right, now I want to fight.

1219
03:40:35,370 --> 03:40:36,889
I want to go back to Centurion.

1220
03:40:37,850 --> 03:40:41,690
It's like I'm seeing the same thing over and over again.

1221
03:40:42,329 --> 03:40:46,059
All right, not this way.

1222
03:40:46,059 --> 03:40:47,739
All right, we got to go back to the tower, right?

1223
03:40:50,040 --> 03:40:50,680
Start the fight.

1224
03:40:50,680 --> 03:40:53,079
I just want to complete all the all the quests.

1225
03:40:53,719 --> 03:41:10,020
All right, not you.

1226
03:41:10,020 --> 03:41:11,299
It's like that first area, right?

1227
03:41:12,020 --> 03:41:17,590
All right, where is he?

1228
03:41:18,229 --> 03:41:19,690
Hour 17.

1229
03:41:21,049 --> 03:41:22,569
Well, he's like, isn't he right here somewhere?

1230
03:41:23,290 --> 03:41:24,809
Where's this guy?

1231
03:41:25,450 --> 03:41:35,239
I think it's this way.

1232
03:41:35,239 --> 03:41:36,760
Say something, cute streamer.

1233
03:41:41,350 --> 03:41:46,700
I'm ready.

1234
03:41:56,840 --> 03:41:57,340
Let's go.

1235
03:42:10,870 --> 03:42:11,989
I know the rules.

1236
03:42:23,340 --> 03:42:29,020
You didn't tell me I couldn't bring a weapon to fight, did you?

1237
03:42:31,059 --> 03:42:34,180
There was no rule that said I couldn't bring a spiked club.

1238
03:42:35,159 --> 03:42:36,680
Redo your rules.

1239
03:42:36,680 --> 03:42:37,559
I'm here to help you.

1240
03:42:43,899 --> 03:42:47,000
Five bucks, and I'll suggest a new fighter.

1241
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,399
You win the show, you're 20 bucks richer.

1242
03:42:49,399 --> 03:42:52,059
Bring me the next one.

1243
03:42:52,059 --> 03:42:54,469
I got a K3 bastard for you to fight next.

1244
03:42:55,030 --> 03:42:56,149
He's called Sawtooth.

1245
03:42:56,149 --> 03:42:57,350
Well, let's go kill this guy.

1246
03:42:57,350 --> 03:42:58,229
Find him in the diner.

1247
03:42:58,229 --> 03:42:59,270
Yeah, let's go kill this guy.

1248
03:42:59,270 --> 03:43:00,229
Yeah, I know who that guy is.

1249
03:43:00,790 --> 03:43:03,110
That guy talked a lot of shit, but he didn't even read the rule book.

1250
03:43:04,729 --> 03:43:06,969
Wait, you mean I could have brought a gun?

1251
03:43:07,690 --> 03:43:09,049
Yep, you're stupid.

1252
03:43:09,690 --> 03:43:31,180
I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to finish it with a parody, too.

1253
03:43:31,819 --> 03:43:33,979
I want to try to I want to bury this thing in his head.

1254
03:43:45,299 --> 03:43:46,739
They still haven't picked that guy up.

1255
03:44:03,780 --> 03:44:04,340
Yep.

1256
03:44:04,340 --> 03:44:04,979
Okay.

1257
03:44:04,979 --> 03:44:07,860
And you I'll see you in the ring.

1258
03:44:08,500 --> 03:44:10,899
So you're really they talk about.

1259
03:44:12,059 --> 03:44:16,180
Yeah, you got yourself a fight.

1260
03:44:16,899 --> 03:44:18,020
You'll see you in the ring.

1261
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:20,920
Nice.

1262
03:44:22,040 --> 03:44:22,760
All right, let's go.

1263
03:44:27,180 --> 03:44:29,909
It's just Vince McMahon.

1264
03:44:30,950 --> 03:44:32,469
You're gonna rot.

1265
03:44:34,260 --> 03:44:38,180
And by the way, you're far.

1266
03:44:38,180 --> 03:45:03,909
Local streamer stuns the entire McMahon family.

1267
03:45:11,180 --> 03:45:12,540
Okay, bring him on.

1268
03:45:12,540 --> 03:45:13,979
I'm going to just make a bunch of money.

1269
03:45:13,979 --> 03:45:16,219
I'll kill everybody in this prison if I have to.

1270
03:45:19,370 --> 03:45:19,930
All right.

1271
03:45:21,209 --> 03:45:22,889
Keep making them stronger and stronger.

1272
03:45:25,129 --> 03:45:27,290
Nobody knows that they can bring a weapon.

1273
03:45:28,010 --> 03:45:29,610
And there's 16 kills in the circle.

1274
03:45:29,610 --> 03:45:30,569
This guy has a weapon.

1275
03:45:32,020 --> 03:45:32,659
Oh, fuck.

1276
03:45:32,659 --> 03:45:34,420
This guy broke the rules.

1277
03:45:34,420 --> 03:45:47,260
That K three at one.

1278
03:45:47,899 --> 03:45:49,100
I'd have lost money.

1279
03:45:49,100 --> 03:45:51,030
So I believe I owe you one.

1280
03:45:57,190 --> 03:45:58,950
Oh, no, they're getting smarter.

1281
03:46:02,309 --> 03:46:02,870
Like three.

1282
03:46:02,870 --> 03:46:03,350
Wait, give me that.

1283
03:46:03,350 --> 03:46:03,909
Can I pick this up?

1284
03:46:03,909 --> 03:46:04,469
Is it illegal?

1285
03:46:05,190 --> 03:46:06,040
I got it.

1286
03:46:06,040 --> 03:46:06,280
Cool.

1287
03:46:06,840 --> 03:46:08,709
Wait, mine's cooler.

1288
03:46:08,709 --> 03:46:09,750
I like mine.

1289
03:46:09,750 --> 03:46:12,739
Yeah, I like mine.

1290
03:46:12,739 --> 03:46:14,100
Mine looks like a counterstrike knife.

1291
03:46:14,659 --> 03:46:17,299
It looks like I spent a lot of money on that.

1292
03:46:17,299 --> 03:46:18,420
Five bucks.

1293
03:46:18,500 --> 03:46:20,420
And I'll suggest a new fight.

1294
03:46:20,420 --> 03:46:21,379
You win the show.

1295
03:46:21,379 --> 03:46:22,420
You're 20 bucks richer.

1296
03:46:24,059 --> 03:46:25,500
Bring me the next one.

1297
03:46:25,500 --> 03:46:27,270
The competition's getting thin now.

1298
03:46:27,270 --> 03:46:28,149
Ready?

1299
03:46:28,149 --> 03:46:29,190
Only Kusa is left.

1300
03:46:29,190 --> 03:46:29,909
Oh, no.

1301
03:46:29,909 --> 03:46:32,250
And I doubt you're going to be able to take him.

1302
03:46:32,250 --> 03:46:34,569
But if you want to try, he's in the courtyard.

1303
03:46:34,569 --> 03:46:35,290
All right.

1304
03:46:35,290 --> 03:46:35,930
I'll take him.

1305
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:40,840
Love him.

1306
03:46:40,840 --> 03:46:42,440
You don't think I'm going to club the next guy?

1307
03:46:46,090 --> 03:46:46,809
Don't go near that guy.

1308
03:46:46,809 --> 03:46:47,530
He's going to search me.

1309
03:47:03,030 --> 03:47:03,719
All right.

1310
03:47:03,719 --> 03:47:04,200
What's his name?

1311
03:47:04,920 --> 03:47:05,399
Uso?

1312
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:07,479
Uso.

1313
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:12,219
Hey, Kuso.

1314
03:47:12,860 --> 03:47:13,659
I'll see you in the ring.

1315
03:47:14,459 --> 03:47:15,100
Hey, Kuso.

1316
03:47:15,100 --> 03:47:15,899
I'll see you in the ring.

1317
03:47:16,780 --> 03:47:18,059
Hey, Kuso.

1318
03:47:18,780 --> 03:47:23,559
Hey, Kuso.

1319
03:47:24,200 --> 03:47:24,950
I'll...

1320
03:47:24,950 --> 03:47:25,110
Hey.

1321
03:47:25,989 --> 03:47:26,229
Hey.

1322
03:47:27,700 --> 03:47:28,500
Hey, Kuso.

1323
03:47:30,100 --> 03:47:30,340
Wait.

1324
03:47:30,899 --> 03:47:34,520
If you need money, feel free to ask anytime.

1325
03:47:34,520 --> 03:47:35,799
I'll loan you interest free.

1326
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:41,110
Wait, isn't this the guy that wanted me to complete the quest?

1327
03:47:41,750 --> 03:47:45,290
Hey, Kuso.

1328
03:47:46,950 --> 03:47:47,989
Uso.

1329
03:47:47,989 --> 03:47:48,469
You.

1330
03:47:48,469 --> 03:47:49,270
Are you Kuso?

1331
03:47:49,829 --> 03:47:50,069
No.

1332
03:47:50,709 --> 03:47:51,030
Nice.

1333
03:47:51,829 --> 03:47:54,090
Here's a little thank you from me to you.

1334
03:47:55,049 --> 03:47:57,290
But I do really need a moth, man.

1335
03:47:57,850 --> 03:47:58,889
Can you help me out?

1336
03:47:58,889 --> 03:47:59,370
A moth?

1337
03:47:59,370 --> 03:47:59,770
Please?

1338
03:48:00,569 --> 03:48:01,450
I'll trade with you.

1339
03:48:02,489 --> 03:48:03,930
What does he want me to do?

1340
03:48:03,930 --> 03:48:05,530
Get a moth.

1341
03:48:05,530 --> 03:48:08,489
Just bring me one of those moths and I'll trade with you.

1342
03:48:08,489 --> 03:48:10,260
I actually have to collect one of the bugs?

1343
03:48:10,260 --> 03:48:11,299
I thought I was illegal.

1344
03:48:12,340 --> 03:48:14,809
Hey, you want anything?

1345
03:48:14,809 --> 03:48:16,139
How do you get a bug?

1346
03:48:16,780 --> 03:48:17,420
No.

1347
03:48:17,420 --> 03:48:19,979
Hey, Kuso.

1348
03:48:20,620 --> 03:48:21,020
Ah.

1349
03:48:21,659 --> 03:48:22,860
You want to fight me, huh?

1350
03:48:23,420 --> 03:48:25,479
I'm going to crack your fucking skull.

1351
03:48:25,479 --> 03:48:27,159
Now go back to Centurion.

1352
03:48:27,159 --> 03:48:28,280
I'll see you in the ring.

1353
03:48:29,079 --> 03:48:29,959
Okay.

1354
03:48:29,959 --> 03:48:30,360
Okay.

1355
03:48:31,319 --> 03:48:32,440
Look out for you.

1356
03:48:32,440 --> 03:48:33,319
You're so strong.

1357
03:48:36,149 --> 03:48:36,389
Yeah.

1358
03:48:36,389 --> 03:48:37,430
Oh, look out.

1359
03:48:37,430 --> 03:48:38,709
He's so strong.

1360
03:48:38,709 --> 03:48:40,229
That's what I would be doing right now.

1361
03:48:40,229 --> 03:48:41,430
You'd piss him off so much.

1362
03:48:42,309 --> 03:48:49,620
Wait, put your both hands in the air with your palms facing out

1363
03:48:49,620 --> 03:48:52,579
and kind of shake them back and forth while you lean your shoulders.

1364
03:48:52,579 --> 03:48:53,780
Oh, yeah.

1365
03:48:53,780 --> 03:48:54,979
People fucking hate that.

1366
03:48:57,620 --> 03:48:58,340
Moth, moth.

1367
03:48:58,340 --> 03:48:59,540
Where am I supposed to get one?

1368
03:48:59,540 --> 03:49:00,739
I can't get a moth.

1369
03:49:01,540 --> 03:49:18,760
I'm in violation.

1370
03:49:18,760 --> 03:49:20,120
You see what's happening here?

1371
03:49:20,120 --> 03:49:20,760
I can't do it.

1372
03:49:21,479 --> 03:49:31,829
You have to press Y.

1373
03:49:54,940 --> 03:49:55,579
What?

1374
03:49:55,579 --> 03:49:58,090
What happened?

1375
03:49:59,299 --> 03:49:59,940
I have one.

1376
03:49:59,940 --> 03:50:00,180
I got one.

1377
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:00,979
How did I get one?

1378
03:50:00,979 --> 03:50:01,860
I didn't even do anything.

1379
03:50:02,739 --> 03:50:05,129
Where is that?

1380
03:50:05,129 --> 03:50:05,610
Where is he?

1381
03:50:08,540 --> 03:50:09,659
It's two tongue, right?

1382
03:50:14,329 --> 03:50:14,889
Two tongue?

1383
03:50:15,940 --> 03:50:16,659
Two tongue.

1384
03:50:18,969 --> 03:50:19,610
Baby.

1385
03:50:20,569 --> 03:50:22,250
That's a fine specimen.

1386
03:50:23,129 --> 03:50:24,649
He's going to smoke a moth.

1387
03:50:24,649 --> 03:50:25,290
Check it out.

1388
03:50:26,010 --> 03:50:27,450
This is what I got for you.

1389
03:50:27,450 --> 03:50:28,010
Something good.

1390
03:50:28,969 --> 03:50:30,889
Buy one bottle of poison.

1391
03:50:31,450 --> 03:50:33,450
Buy three grams of G-Smack.

1392
03:50:34,940 --> 03:50:36,059
Somebody's going to fly.

1393
03:50:36,620 --> 03:50:37,100
I'll take it.

1394
03:50:37,100 --> 03:50:37,579
I'll take it.

1395
03:50:37,579 --> 03:50:38,139
I don't even know what it is.

1396
03:50:38,139 --> 03:50:38,940
Yeah.

1397
03:50:38,940 --> 03:50:40,379
It's the heavy stuff, man.

1398
03:50:40,940 --> 03:50:43,579
Listen, just don't flash it in front of the axe, though.

1399
03:50:44,299 --> 03:50:45,459
All right.

1400
03:50:46,260 --> 03:50:46,979
Check it out.

1401
03:50:47,620 --> 03:50:49,379
This is what I got for you.

1402
03:50:49,379 --> 03:50:50,500
I want poison, too.

1403
03:50:51,139 --> 03:50:52,180
Give me the poison.

1404
03:50:52,739 --> 03:50:53,299
Here you go.

1405
03:50:54,020 --> 03:50:55,459
But I don't ever want to know.

1406
03:50:56,260 --> 03:50:57,219
And I also want...

1407
03:50:57,379 --> 03:50:58,260
I don't have any money.

1408
03:50:58,260 --> 03:50:59,510
Wait.

1409
03:50:59,510 --> 03:51:00,950
Where's the guy that loans money?

1410
03:51:00,950 --> 03:51:01,510
I want...

1411
03:51:05,510 --> 03:51:06,069
Wait.

1412
03:51:10,549 --> 03:51:12,069
Oh, he's doing the thing that says, like,

1413
03:51:12,069 --> 03:51:13,909
hey, man, the game's about to progress.

1414
03:51:15,270 --> 03:51:17,829
You're about to progress in the game, man.

1415
03:51:17,829 --> 03:51:18,629
Get ready.

1416
03:51:19,989 --> 03:51:29,719
Are you sure that you want to move on to the final chapter?

1417
03:51:30,600 --> 03:51:31,000
Club?

1418
03:51:31,000 --> 03:51:46,379
Yeah, I'm going to club him.

1419
03:51:46,940 --> 03:51:52,440
This guy thinks he's going to bring a knife to a crime scene.

1420
03:51:52,440 --> 03:51:53,879
Bring a knife to a club fight.

1421
03:51:55,270 --> 03:51:57,510
Or he might be the reason why he's the strongest opponent

1422
03:51:57,510 --> 03:51:58,950
is because he has a club himself.

1423
03:51:59,829 --> 03:52:00,840
We'll find out.

1424
03:52:10,139 --> 03:52:11,180
So you got your challenge.

1425
03:52:11,819 --> 03:52:13,739
You win, you get 20 UDs.

1426
03:52:13,739 --> 03:52:15,100
Get into the ring, Mr. Riddick.

1427
03:52:16,809 --> 03:52:18,889
Today, we have a fight to remember.

1428
03:52:18,889 --> 03:52:19,389
Okay.

1429
03:52:19,770 --> 03:52:23,530
The unstoppable Riddick against Cusa, the meat grinder.

1430
03:52:23,530 --> 03:52:25,930
Ooh, he's got his own little nickname.

1431
03:52:40,969 --> 03:52:42,569
So you've killed all the best fighters.

1432
03:52:42,569 --> 03:52:43,770
Nobody can beat me.

1433
03:52:44,489 --> 03:52:45,610
Now, there's only one remaining.

1434
03:52:45,610 --> 03:52:46,409
Only one?

1435
03:52:46,409 --> 03:52:47,209
And that's Bam.

1436
03:52:47,690 --> 03:52:49,340
And he's one dangerous-

1437
03:52:50,379 --> 03:52:51,340
What do you mean Bam?

1438
03:52:52,299 --> 03:52:53,100
Where is-

1439
03:52:53,100 --> 03:52:53,500
Where is he?

1440
03:52:53,500 --> 03:52:54,139
Is he down here?

1441
03:52:54,780 --> 03:53:00,569
Where do I find Bam?

1442
03:53:05,239 --> 03:53:07,379
I got a message from Bam.

1443
03:53:07,379 --> 03:53:08,940
He'll fight.

1444
03:53:08,940 --> 03:53:10,860
Problem for me is that you might win.

1445
03:53:11,420 --> 03:53:13,590
And Hoxie ain't going to like that.

1446
03:53:13,590 --> 03:53:15,750
Your problem isn't the Hox.

1447
03:53:16,309 --> 03:53:17,610
It's me.

1448
03:53:18,329 --> 03:53:19,930
Yes, you are a problem.

1449
03:53:19,930 --> 03:53:20,809
I'm a problem.

1450
03:53:20,809 --> 03:53:22,649
Hoxie will probably send Abbott down for you.

1451
03:53:23,290 --> 03:53:24,170
That is, if you win.

1452
03:53:24,969 --> 03:53:25,690
Will he now?

1453
03:53:25,690 --> 03:53:26,409
Abbott and me.

1454
03:53:27,370 --> 03:53:28,809
We have unfinished business.

1455
03:53:28,809 --> 03:53:29,690
Isn't he dead?

1456
03:53:29,690 --> 03:53:30,809
So what's the deal, Riddick?

1457
03:53:31,370 --> 03:53:32,329
You gonna fight or not?

1458
03:53:33,129 --> 03:53:33,690
It's five-

1459
03:53:33,690 --> 03:53:36,489
Didn't I shoot him in the face with a shotgun like ten times?

1460
03:53:37,290 --> 03:53:38,010
I'll fight.

1461
03:53:38,010 --> 03:53:38,409
Let's go.

1462
03:53:39,370 --> 03:53:46,020
Wait, they have to bring this guy down from upper management?

1463
03:53:46,819 --> 03:53:50,149
Does he realize he's about to get fucking clubbed?

1464
03:53:50,149 --> 03:53:50,469
All right, all right, all right.

1465
03:53:50,469 --> 03:53:52,709
I bet this is what you've all been expecting, huh?

1466
03:53:52,709 --> 03:53:55,100
Riddick versus Bam.

1467
03:53:55,100 --> 03:53:56,219
Need I say more?

1468
03:53:56,860 --> 03:53:59,860
You all fight to death!

1469
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:03,739
Give me the club!

1470
03:54:29,590 --> 03:54:32,149
Okay, it's like-

1471
03:54:32,149 --> 03:54:36,149
That's the shit that you try to avoid at a kid's birthday party.

1472
03:54:36,149 --> 03:54:38,790
When you put the blindfold on him, you give him a big stick and it's like,

1473
03:54:38,790 --> 03:54:39,989
All right, spin him around!

1474
03:54:39,989 --> 03:54:42,709
And the kid just starts fucking swinging.

1475
03:54:43,590 --> 03:54:44,229
Oh, look out!

1476
03:54:45,270 --> 03:54:46,629
He's gonna hit one of the other kids!

1477
03:54:47,350 --> 03:54:50,040
I got a message from Bam.

1478
03:54:50,040 --> 03:54:52,379
He'll fight.

1479
03:54:52,379 --> 03:54:54,299
Problem for me is that you might win.

1480
03:54:55,020 --> 03:54:55,819
Did I win?

1481
03:54:55,819 --> 03:54:56,700
Hoxie ain't gonna like that.

1482
03:54:56,700 --> 03:54:57,100
I know.

1483
03:54:57,100 --> 03:54:58,620
Your problem isn't the Hox.

1484
03:54:58,620 --> 03:54:59,500
Hold on, I gotta settle that.

1485
03:55:00,459 --> 03:55:01,340
It's me.

1486
03:55:01,340 --> 03:55:02,940
I knocked him out of the circle.

1487
03:55:02,940 --> 03:55:04,059
You are a problem.

1488
03:55:04,059 --> 03:55:06,139
Hoxie will probably send Abbott down for you.

1489
03:55:06,780 --> 03:55:07,659
That is, if you win.

1490
03:55:08,860 --> 03:55:10,379
I did knock him out of the circle, though.

1491
03:55:10,379 --> 03:55:10,940
That's true.

1492
03:55:10,940 --> 03:55:12,620
We have unfinished business.

1493
03:55:12,620 --> 03:55:14,139
What's the deal, Riddick?

1494
03:55:14,139 --> 03:55:15,100
You gonna fight or not?

1495
03:55:16,250 --> 03:55:17,450
Of course I'm gonna fight.

1496
03:55:20,329 --> 03:55:21,209
Wait, the turrets-

1497
03:55:23,829 --> 03:55:25,510
I can't handle this much right now.

1498
03:55:25,510 --> 03:55:27,350
All right, the turrets shot him to death.

1499
03:55:30,409 --> 03:55:31,610
All right, let's go club!

1500
03:55:43,350 --> 03:55:44,389
Holy shit, this guy's good.

1501
03:55:51,750 --> 03:55:53,829
He's gonna beat me and have a weapon.

1502
03:55:53,829 --> 03:55:54,469
Don't let him win.

1503
03:55:55,110 --> 03:56:07,670
This guy-

1504
03:56:07,670 --> 03:56:09,110
Well, I feel like this guy should've talked.

1505
03:56:10,409 --> 03:56:11,129
What's happening?

1506
03:56:12,809 --> 03:56:13,610
What's going on?

1507
03:56:16,010 --> 03:56:17,290
Why did that guy not speak?

1508
03:56:18,250 --> 03:56:20,090
They dragged him out here like fucking-

1509
03:56:22,329 --> 03:56:23,690
What's the guy's name from Rocky?

1510
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:25,579
Drogo?

1511
03:56:26,299 --> 03:56:28,899
He didn't even get to say anything.

1512
03:56:31,700 --> 03:56:32,819
Call Drogo, right?

1513
03:56:32,819 --> 03:56:33,379
No, what was his-

1514
03:56:33,379 --> 03:56:33,940
What's his name?

1515
03:56:34,739 --> 03:56:37,399
Talk to me.

1516
03:56:37,959 --> 03:56:38,760
Ivan Dro-

1517
03:56:38,760 --> 03:56:40,280
Oh, yes, Ivan Drogo.

1518
03:56:43,850 --> 03:56:45,129
Oh shit, a club.

1519
03:56:45,129 --> 03:56:46,010
I know what that is.

1520
03:56:46,010 --> 03:56:47,290
You're not still mad at me.

1521
03:56:47,290 --> 03:56:49,930
Let's see.

1522
03:56:49,930 --> 03:56:57,829
Am I still mad at-

1523
03:56:57,829 --> 03:56:59,670
Ooh.

1524
03:56:59,670 --> 03:57:00,709
No.

1525
03:57:00,709 --> 03:57:02,870
In fact, I'm feeling much better.

1526
03:57:19,540 --> 03:57:20,899
You're a hard ass, Riddick.

1527
03:57:21,459 --> 03:57:22,979
But we're about to soften you up.

1528
03:57:22,979 --> 03:57:24,659
God damn it, this is the nerf one.

1529
03:57:24,659 --> 03:57:27,139
Give me the real one, you fucking asshole.

1530
03:57:27,139 --> 03:57:27,780
Nice prank.

1531
03:57:28,420 --> 03:57:30,579
That is right, Riddick.

1532
03:57:30,579 --> 03:57:31,540
They don't know.

1533
03:57:31,540 --> 03:57:35,610
But you are going to show them.

1534
03:57:35,610 --> 03:57:37,930
There is a fury within you, Riddick.

1535
03:57:40,219 --> 03:57:41,020
Set it free.

1536
03:57:46,940 --> 03:57:47,440
What?

1537
03:57:48,219 --> 03:57:54,700
Okay, he does have superpowers.

1538
03:57:54,700 --> 03:57:55,500
You guys lied to me.

1539
03:57:55,500 --> 03:57:57,340
I thought you guys just said he could see in the dark.

1540
03:57:58,379 --> 03:58:17,590
Why does he look green screened?

1541
03:58:17,590 --> 03:58:18,709
Oh shit, club fight.

1542
03:58:19,670 --> 03:58:37,610
I have to-

1543
03:58:37,610 --> 03:58:42,280
Come on, I need to parry.

1544
03:58:42,920 --> 03:58:45,510
Wait, you can't parry bosses.

1545
03:58:51,770 --> 03:59:04,120
I-

1546
03:59:04,120 --> 03:59:04,620
I win.

1547
03:59:05,159 --> 03:59:09,860
No surveillance means it never happened.

1548
03:59:09,860 --> 03:59:11,780
Wait, do I want my club or his club?

1549
03:59:19,739 --> 03:59:21,239
My club.

1550
03:59:26,020 --> 03:59:26,739
The door is open.

1551
03:59:28,329 --> 03:59:29,049
The door-

1552
03:59:29,049 --> 03:59:30,090
It's an open door.

1553
03:59:31,450 --> 03:59:32,729
What was the point of that?

1554
03:59:33,290 --> 03:59:43,219
This guy keeps coming back.

1555
03:59:44,379 --> 03:59:45,100
Wait, there's a gun.

1556
03:59:45,659 --> 03:59:50,100
There's a gun.

1557
03:59:50,100 --> 03:59:52,489
I saw this-

1558
03:59:52,489 --> 03:59:53,290
No, that was a club.

1559
03:59:53,290 --> 03:59:54,409
All right, this guy keeps coming back.

1560
03:59:54,409 --> 03:59:55,290
So we're going to take him with us.

1561
03:59:56,170 --> 04:00:00,299
I'm not going to let this guy come back for like a third time.

1562
04:00:01,100 --> 04:00:13,479
Come on, get up here.

1563
04:00:14,200 --> 04:00:22,700
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1564
04:00:22,700 --> 04:00:23,500
There's a ride.

1565
04:00:23,500 --> 04:00:24,299
There's a ride over here.

1566
04:00:24,860 --> 04:00:27,959
There's a ride.

1567
04:00:41,670 --> 04:00:42,870
Whoever is editing this-

1568
04:00:42,870 --> 04:00:43,750
I want you to take a second.

1569
04:00:43,750 --> 04:00:45,350
Whoever is editing this video,

1570
04:00:45,430 --> 04:00:48,149
make sure you put in like a roller coaster going down

1571
04:00:48,149 --> 04:00:55,739
with a bunch of people screaming in happiness right there.

1572
04:00:55,739 --> 04:00:56,540
Very important.

1573
04:00:56,540 --> 04:00:58,659
What happened to this guy?

1574
04:00:58,659 --> 04:00:59,860
Oh, wait, this is where I-

1575
04:00:59,860 --> 04:01:00,360
All right.

1576
04:01:19,510 --> 04:01:20,010
Whoa!

1577
04:01:32,680 --> 04:01:33,079
Yes.

1578
04:01:33,079 --> 04:01:33,879
All right, he's still-

1579
04:01:33,879 --> 04:01:34,379
Whatever.

1580
04:01:34,840 --> 04:01:37,459
Because I had this stupid club out.

1581
04:01:39,979 --> 04:01:40,379
Club.

1582
04:01:40,379 --> 04:01:41,420
No club allowed.

1583
04:01:41,979 --> 04:01:42,940
Okay, but what about-

1584
04:01:42,940 --> 04:01:44,219
This is the ultimate test.

1585
04:01:45,239 --> 04:01:46,360
I can't bring my club in there,

1586
04:01:46,360 --> 04:01:48,200
but can I bring this dead body through?

1587
04:01:55,899 --> 04:01:56,219
Nope.

1588
04:01:56,219 --> 04:01:57,100
No clubs allowed.

1589
04:01:57,819 --> 04:01:59,780
Damn it.

1590
04:01:59,780 --> 04:02:01,139
I really thought it was going to happen.

1591
04:02:01,700 --> 04:02:08,760
Your head-

1592
04:02:08,760 --> 04:02:09,239
This isn't-

1593
04:02:12,569 --> 04:02:14,170
No bodies allowed either.

1594
04:02:14,170 --> 04:02:14,969
I have the-

1595
04:02:14,969 --> 04:02:15,690
Put the club away.

1596
04:02:16,409 --> 04:02:19,069
We're good.

1597
04:02:26,459 --> 04:02:26,959
All right.

1598
04:02:29,340 --> 04:02:30,139
All right, well, I'm back-

1599
04:02:30,139 --> 04:02:31,020
I'm just back here.

1600
04:02:31,020 --> 04:02:31,659
I couldn't escape.

1601
04:02:34,149 --> 04:02:35,270
What am I doing back in the prison?

1602
04:02:35,270 --> 04:02:36,149
You know, I just-

1603
04:02:36,149 --> 04:02:37,030
What am I doing back here?

1604
04:02:37,829 --> 04:02:42,229
I could have just got the hell out of here.

1605
04:02:42,870 --> 04:02:44,760
All right, hold on.

1606
04:02:44,760 --> 04:02:47,959
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1607
04:02:47,959 --> 04:02:49,479
Lost his glasses in the mines.

1608
04:02:49,479 --> 04:02:50,760
They might be in the upper mines.

1609
04:02:50,760 --> 04:02:51,260
Okay.

1610
04:02:52,440 --> 04:02:54,440
Let's see all the blue skins dead.

1611
04:02:54,440 --> 04:02:54,940
Okay.

1612
04:02:56,040 --> 04:02:57,819
I have to go down to the mines.

1613
04:02:57,819 --> 04:02:59,500
You've got a special key card from Abbott.

1614
04:02:59,500 --> 04:03:00,620
It ought to open some door

1615
04:03:00,620 --> 04:03:01,979
probably near the work pass.

1616
04:03:01,979 --> 04:03:02,479
Whoa.

1617
04:03:06,600 --> 04:03:07,100
All right.

1618
04:03:07,719 --> 04:03:15,680
I'm seeing a lot of German dot dot dots.

1619
04:03:16,399 --> 04:03:17,659
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1620
04:03:17,659 --> 04:03:18,940
I was supposed to delete channel points.

1621
04:03:18,940 --> 04:03:19,659
I forgot.

1622
04:03:19,659 --> 04:03:20,540
Thanks for reminding me.

1623
04:03:21,340 --> 04:03:25,899
I need to go to the-

1624
04:03:26,540 --> 04:03:27,579
There's a new guy over there.

1625
04:03:28,379 --> 04:03:33,520
I'm not going over there.

1626
04:03:42,590 --> 04:03:43,229
Hey, Riddick.

1627
04:03:43,229 --> 04:03:44,750
You want to buy smokes?

1628
04:03:44,750 --> 04:03:45,950
You want to buy smokes?

1629
04:03:46,590 --> 04:03:47,069
No.

1630
04:03:47,069 --> 04:03:47,950
I like this guy's voice.

1631
04:03:48,510 --> 04:03:54,409
Oh, well, I see that-

1632
04:03:54,409 --> 04:03:56,809
I see that they have successfully ruined the chat room.

1633
04:03:58,299 --> 04:03:58,860
It's on-

1634
04:03:58,860 --> 04:03:59,899
It's nothing there now.

1635
04:03:59,899 --> 04:04:01,739
It's just unreadable purple text.

1636
04:04:04,030 --> 04:04:04,750
Okay.

1637
04:04:05,629 --> 04:04:09,520
I really wanted to have a nice chat room,

1638
04:04:10,159 --> 04:04:13,790
but I guess that's just not going to be the case.

1639
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:15,500
Okay.

1640
04:04:16,040 --> 04:04:24,459
Here's the key card.

1641
04:04:24,940 --> 04:04:26,600
Does this guy have anything?

1642
04:04:26,600 --> 04:04:28,040
If you find my glasses-

1643
04:04:28,040 --> 04:04:29,000
Okay, find glasses.

1644
04:04:30,440 --> 04:04:30,940
Go.

1645
04:04:34,799 --> 04:04:38,879
Who is surrendering?

1646
04:04:54,219 --> 04:04:55,899
I don't want that guy to be dead.

1647
04:04:55,899 --> 04:04:57,100
No, I did the Dark Souls.

1648
04:04:57,100 --> 04:04:58,059
It killed me so I can do-

1649
04:04:58,940 --> 04:05:00,940
Just kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.

1650
04:05:00,940 --> 04:05:02,219
I don't want that guy to die.

1651
04:05:02,219 --> 04:05:03,979
I was going to break his neck, but it didn't work.

1652
04:05:04,780 --> 04:05:08,700
So what happened?

1653
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:10,540
Access granted, and then he came after me.

1654
04:05:15,760 --> 04:05:16,239
Over here?

1655
04:05:30,620 --> 04:05:31,260
Dude, I just-

1656
04:05:36,510 --> 04:05:37,389
Touch the reactor.

1657
04:05:47,819 --> 04:05:48,299
Okay.

1658
04:05:48,299 --> 04:05:49,899
So, two doors.

1659
04:05:49,899 --> 04:05:51,819
They both have bad guys in them.

1660
04:05:51,819 --> 04:05:53,790
I have to get down to the mines somehow.

1661
04:05:56,120 --> 04:05:57,799
If I open this door, this guy freaks out,

1662
04:05:57,799 --> 04:05:59,000
so I have to go in this one.

1663
04:05:59,000 --> 04:05:59,500
I have to.

1664
04:06:00,040 --> 04:06:06,350
I still have poison.

1665
04:06:06,350 --> 04:06:07,870
I guarantee the people that have them.

1666
04:06:07,870 --> 04:06:08,750
And there's people that-

1667
04:06:09,469 --> 04:06:11,309
There's probably people that have-

1668
04:06:11,309 --> 04:06:12,110
Why is that hard to say?

1669
04:06:13,069 --> 04:06:14,780
That guy's hot.

1670
04:06:14,780 --> 04:06:16,139
You actually saw me through the wall.

1671
04:06:23,920 --> 04:06:26,879
If you find my glasses, give them to me,

1672
04:06:26,879 --> 04:06:28,559
and I will help you in return.

1673
04:06:33,440 --> 04:06:36,399
If you find my glasses, give them to me,

1674
04:06:36,399 --> 04:06:38,079
and I will help you in return.

1675
04:06:38,799 --> 04:06:42,670
Did we fuck it up?

1676
04:06:42,670 --> 04:06:43,629
Are we safe?

1677
04:06:43,629 --> 04:06:44,350
I think we're safe.

1678
04:06:45,069 --> 04:06:51,040
Yeah, are you gonna punch him?

1679
04:06:53,180 --> 04:06:54,540
He's not gonna throw a punch, is he?

1680
04:06:56,879 --> 04:06:58,000
This fucking reset.

1681
04:06:58,639 --> 04:07:07,840
Okay.

1682
04:07:07,840 --> 04:07:11,209
So, should I just run through the door?

1683
04:07:11,770 --> 04:07:13,049
I think who cares?

1684
04:07:13,770 --> 04:07:19,500
I have to stealth.

1685
04:07:25,819 --> 04:07:26,700
Stealth.

1686
04:07:26,700 --> 04:07:27,500
Look, I just-

1687
04:07:27,500 --> 04:07:28,940
I open the door and the guy goes,

1688
04:07:28,940 --> 04:07:30,059
Here's the boxes.

1689
04:07:30,700 --> 04:07:31,879
Where'd he watch?

1690
04:07:33,069 --> 04:07:34,030
I found him.

1691
04:07:34,030 --> 04:07:53,920
Why do these guys all have laser sights on him?

1692
04:07:55,440 --> 04:07:56,479
Do I have to go over here?

1693
04:07:57,360 --> 04:08:01,559
Like, I'm gonna climb up.

1694
04:08:01,559 --> 04:08:02,360
Someone's here.

1695
04:08:03,079 --> 04:08:04,520
How would you even know that?

1696
04:08:04,520 --> 04:08:05,159
How would you know that?

1697
04:08:05,159 --> 04:08:06,120
There's no way you could have known that.

1698
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:06,680
I didn't do anything.

1699
04:08:12,940 --> 04:08:13,739
Nothing here.

1700
04:08:28,000 --> 04:08:29,280
You're gonna die!

1701
04:08:29,280 --> 04:08:31,799
Wait, give me the gun.

1702
04:08:31,799 --> 04:08:35,879
Give me the gun.

1703
04:08:35,879 --> 04:08:38,159
Use Riddick mode.

1704
04:08:46,479 --> 04:08:46,719
What?

1705
04:08:46,719 --> 04:08:47,920
Didn't I get the DNA for this?

1706
04:08:48,479 --> 04:09:03,719
Wait, vent tool, right?

1707
04:09:04,799 --> 04:09:05,760
I don't know.

1708
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:07,549
A real Wink?

1709
04:09:07,549 --> 04:09:08,430
It's been disabled.

1710
04:09:08,430 --> 04:09:08,989
It's not there.

1711
04:09:18,270 --> 04:09:19,229
You can't trick me.

1712
04:09:19,229 --> 04:09:20,510
That shit's been disabled.

1713
04:09:21,870 --> 04:09:22,190
Months.

1714
04:09:22,829 --> 04:09:35,260
Wait, why am I on an elevator?

1715
04:09:36,059 --> 04:09:37,610
Oh.

1716
04:09:37,610 --> 04:09:38,569
Did I make it to the mines?

1717
04:09:39,129 --> 04:09:41,260
No, no Winks.

1718
04:09:41,260 --> 04:09:42,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1719
04:09:43,260 --> 04:09:45,559
Through the mines.

1720
04:09:46,909 --> 04:09:47,870
Jagger balance.

1721
04:09:48,590 --> 04:09:50,510
Straight to the spaceport.

1722
04:09:50,510 --> 04:09:51,950
I don't have any clothes on.

1723
04:09:51,950 --> 04:09:52,909
I cannot do what you ask.

1724
04:09:57,739 --> 04:09:58,299
Did I get him?

1725
04:09:59,579 --> 04:10:03,129
Holy shit, I got him.

1726
04:10:04,409 --> 04:10:05,770
Ooh, that hurt.

1727
04:10:06,569 --> 04:10:19,159
I need the DNA.

1728
04:10:19,959 --> 04:10:22,780
Okay, this is the Harry Potter ride.

1729
04:10:23,420 --> 04:10:27,180
The exact image of when Voldemort's sitting on the rock

1730
04:10:27,180 --> 04:10:28,299
and there's two or three people.

1731
04:10:28,299 --> 04:10:29,659
It's that ride at Universal.

1732
04:10:30,379 --> 04:10:31,180
You end up coming down.

1733
04:10:31,180 --> 04:10:32,940
You eavesdrop on a conversation they have.

1734
04:10:34,030 --> 04:10:34,430
Right here.

1735
04:10:34,989 --> 04:10:35,950
This exact spot.

1736
04:10:47,129 --> 04:10:48,010
I'm not making a joke.

1737
04:10:48,010 --> 04:10:49,770
That's just a reality.

1738
04:10:49,770 --> 04:10:51,209
I just had to say it because that's what I saw.

1739
04:10:55,340 --> 04:10:56,379
I'm just telling you.

1740
04:10:56,379 --> 04:10:56,940
That's what it is.

1741
04:10:56,940 --> 04:10:57,899
When you go there, you're going to be like,

1742
04:10:57,899 --> 04:10:58,700
oh shit, that's right.

1743
04:11:02,139 --> 04:11:03,739
Okay, I'll enter the correct code.

1744
04:11:04,299 --> 04:11:05,209
Minus two.

1745
04:11:05,209 --> 04:11:06,329
I've never been to Universal.

1746
04:11:07,129 --> 04:11:08,670
All right.

1747
04:11:09,309 --> 04:11:18,250
I was just looking at the fan.

1748
04:11:28,270 --> 04:11:34,000
Come on, stop it.

1749
04:11:36,559 --> 04:11:51,049
I didn't get him.

1750
04:11:51,690 --> 04:11:54,379
I didn't get it.

1751
04:11:54,379 --> 04:11:55,420
Close it, close it, close it.

1752
04:11:55,420 --> 04:11:56,139
Move out of the way.

1753
04:11:59,799 --> 04:12:00,040
What?

1754
04:12:04,569 --> 04:12:06,159
Why is the door closed?

1755
04:12:11,520 --> 04:12:12,639
They forgot I was in here.

1756
04:12:13,770 --> 04:12:14,649
Oh my lord.

1757
04:12:15,530 --> 04:12:24,120
I'm not soft-locked.

1758
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:24,520
I got it.

1759
04:12:24,520 --> 04:12:25,799
I'll get it right now.

1760
04:12:25,799 --> 04:12:27,799
I don't understand why I can't pick up the rifle.

1761
04:12:27,799 --> 04:12:31,209
You rode the mines through Jagger Balance

1762
04:12:31,930 --> 04:12:33,370
straight to the spaceport.

1763
04:12:46,360 --> 04:12:50,059
Oh, that was pretty cool.

1764
04:12:50,059 --> 04:12:50,620
Let's dump him.

1765
04:12:51,420 --> 04:13:06,889
I don't want me to fall

1766
04:13:06,889 --> 04:13:09,530
and I know everyone thinks that everyone's waiting for...

1767
04:13:09,530 --> 04:13:11,049
I know everyone's waiting for it to happen.

1768
04:13:11,930 --> 04:13:15,389
So I'm just going to stop

1769
04:13:15,389 --> 04:13:17,229
because I know everyone thinks that's what I'm doing

1770
04:13:17,229 --> 04:13:18,270
and I'm not going to give you that.

1771
04:13:18,270 --> 04:13:18,909
I'm not doing it.

1772
04:13:19,469 --> 04:13:20,350
I'm not going to fall off.

1773
04:13:20,350 --> 04:13:21,469
No, that's not what I'm doing.

1774
04:13:22,110 --> 04:13:38,030
What's the point of this?

1775
04:13:38,030 --> 04:13:45,260
Why can't I get up here?

1776
04:13:45,260 --> 04:14:03,319
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1777
04:14:07,610 --> 04:14:20,969
Climb, climb.

1778
04:14:20,969 --> 04:14:22,250
Climb where though?

1779
04:14:22,250 --> 04:14:24,829
On the...

1780
04:14:24,829 --> 04:14:25,709
There's a gun on the bridge.

1781
04:14:25,709 --> 04:14:26,270
I can't pick it up.

1782
04:14:26,989 --> 04:14:30,200
Climb up there?

1783
04:14:32,250 --> 04:14:42,649
No, at least you can.

1784
04:14:43,209 --> 04:14:48,270
There's a door by the lift.

1785
04:14:48,909 --> 04:14:49,790
Is this a door?

1786
04:14:50,590 --> 04:14:52,319
No, this is not what you think it is.

1787
04:14:52,959 --> 04:14:57,129
Can't make that thing go up.

1788
04:14:57,690 --> 04:15:04,600
Just dodge the bullets.

1789
04:15:11,239 --> 04:15:14,170
Grab the gun.

1790
04:15:14,170 --> 04:15:15,209
I can't grab the gun.

1791
04:15:15,209 --> 04:15:15,930
I already tried it.

1792
04:15:16,569 --> 04:15:20,040
There has to be something with this, right?

1793
04:15:20,760 --> 04:15:22,200
I just don't know the code, but...

1794
04:15:23,239 --> 04:15:24,200
Can these be moved?

1795
04:15:27,549 --> 04:15:28,670
Why would they be here like this?

1796
04:15:29,229 --> 04:15:39,790
Can I go up here?

1797
04:15:40,350 --> 04:15:48,270
Flare the guard with some noises?

1798
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:56,399
I'm just going to go fight them.

1799
04:15:57,120 --> 04:16:00,079
I'm just going to go fight them.

1800
04:16:14,250 --> 04:16:16,649
Give me that gun.

1801
04:16:18,299 --> 04:16:19,260
All right, good.

1802
04:16:19,340 --> 04:16:21,260
Did I really actually have to do that?

1803
04:16:21,260 --> 04:16:22,059
Hey, watch.

1804
04:16:22,059 --> 04:16:22,620
Can't touch it.

1805
04:16:23,180 --> 04:16:29,790
Security checkpoint.

1806
04:16:30,909 --> 04:16:42,459
I really do feel like I should have a gun at this point.

1807
04:16:43,260 --> 04:17:08,590
Is there one of those big things right here?

1808
04:17:08,590 --> 04:17:10,200
There is.

1809
04:17:10,200 --> 04:17:26,239
Dude, why are people saying piss and cock?

1810
04:17:26,239 --> 04:17:26,799
I don't know.

1811
04:17:26,799 --> 04:17:27,920
Why don't you ask them?

1812
04:17:27,920 --> 04:17:31,799
I'm sure you'll get a detailed write-up of why they're doing that.

1813
04:17:31,799 --> 04:17:33,739
All right, so I...

1814
04:17:34,299 --> 04:17:35,680
What am I missing here?

1815
04:17:35,680 --> 04:17:37,120
I can't take any of the lights out.

1816
04:17:54,829 --> 04:17:56,110
Wait, you're talking about me?

1817
04:18:07,020 --> 04:18:09,819
Can we go over to some other block and see if they'll let us in?

1818
04:18:09,819 --> 04:18:10,860
That makes sense.

1819
04:18:10,860 --> 04:18:13,020
Let's meet in the square half an hour after the shift ends.

1820
04:18:16,409 --> 04:18:17,209
All right, now you move.

1821
04:18:24,250 --> 04:18:24,969
Well, he looked at me.

1822
04:18:25,690 --> 04:18:26,250
What was that?

1823
04:18:26,889 --> 04:18:39,500
Okay, well, I'm obviously supposed to be here, but now what?

1824
04:18:46,399 --> 04:18:47,120
Kylo Ren?

1825
04:19:02,280 --> 04:19:02,600
What?

1826
04:19:02,600 --> 04:19:10,409
I feel like Spaghet right now.

1827
04:19:10,409 --> 04:19:11,690
Nothing here.

1828
04:19:11,690 --> 04:19:12,809
Okay, I'm just...

1829
04:19:13,530 --> 04:19:16,620
I can go through there.

1830
04:19:16,620 --> 04:19:17,899
Wait, climb this.

1831
04:19:28,959 --> 04:19:30,239
Is there a light switch in here?

1832
04:19:30,239 --> 04:19:36,700
There has to be, right?

1833
04:19:36,700 --> 04:19:38,620
Where's the light switch?

1834
04:19:38,620 --> 04:19:41,280
Please be behind me.

1835
04:19:41,280 --> 04:19:42,479
Is there a light switch?

1836
04:19:43,040 --> 04:19:50,319
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1837
04:19:50,319 --> 04:19:50,479
I'm...

1838
04:19:51,280 --> 04:19:52,079
All right, I'm good, I'm good.

1839
04:19:55,020 --> 04:19:57,100
All right, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

1840
04:19:57,100 --> 04:19:58,190
I'm going this way.

1841
04:20:00,909 --> 04:20:04,190
Oh, shit, I can back-snipe this guy.

1842
04:20:11,440 --> 04:20:12,319
Oh, my God.

1843
04:20:12,319 --> 04:20:12,959
I need his body.

1844
04:20:14,399 --> 04:20:15,920
No, his body.

1845
04:20:15,920 --> 04:20:16,719
His body.

1846
04:20:37,739 --> 04:20:39,709
One, two, three.

1847
04:20:45,149 --> 04:20:46,110
I would have had it.

1848
04:20:46,110 --> 04:20:46,430
All right.

1849
04:20:49,399 --> 04:20:50,040
I would have had it.

1850
04:20:50,040 --> 04:20:55,129
It would have had it.

1851
04:20:55,129 --> 04:20:56,170
Something quicker, the shift.

1852
04:20:56,729 --> 04:21:17,979
Why would you kick him forward?

1853
04:21:18,700 --> 04:21:20,299
Oh, my God, Riddick.

1854
04:21:21,659 --> 04:21:22,219
That's the...

1855
04:21:22,219 --> 04:21:23,579
Oh, he's stealthy, huh?

1856
04:21:23,579 --> 04:21:25,979
Why would you boot him towards the people?

1857
04:21:27,399 --> 04:21:29,399
That's the stupidest thing you could do.

1858
04:21:30,360 --> 04:21:44,360
So, we're going to not do any weapon.

1859
04:21:44,360 --> 04:21:46,280
We're going to just break his neck with our bare hands.

1860
04:21:50,600 --> 04:21:51,799
Oh, shit.

1861
04:21:51,799 --> 04:21:52,920
No, no, fine.

1862
04:21:52,920 --> 04:21:58,680
Just kill me.

1863
04:21:58,680 --> 04:21:59,399
Kill me.

1864
04:21:59,399 --> 04:22:00,360
Kill me.

1865
04:22:00,360 --> 04:22:01,319
Kill me.

1866
04:22:01,319 --> 04:22:01,799
Kill me.

1867
04:22:02,520 --> 04:22:03,079
Just do it.

1868
04:22:03,879 --> 04:22:10,909
I can't believe it.

1869
04:22:10,909 --> 04:22:30,889
It is kind of Kylo Ren, isn't it?

1870
04:22:31,450 --> 04:22:36,649
Wait, climb up, somebody said?

1871
04:22:37,290 --> 04:22:39,760
Holy shit.

1872
04:22:39,760 --> 04:22:40,479
Climb up.

1873
04:22:40,479 --> 04:22:41,200
It's still dark.

1874
04:22:42,319 --> 04:22:42,719
Nice.

1875
04:22:42,719 --> 04:22:43,600
It's dark over here.

1876
04:22:44,809 --> 04:22:45,290
Now what?

1877
04:22:45,930 --> 04:22:48,360
Now what?

1878
04:22:51,200 --> 04:22:51,600
Can I jump?

1879
04:22:51,600 --> 04:22:52,239
Can I get there?

1880
04:22:53,200 --> 04:22:57,309
Can I grab that?

1881
04:22:58,030 --> 04:23:08,030
The bars.

1882
04:23:08,030 --> 04:23:09,549
Yeah, that's what I was trying to grab.

1883
04:23:09,549 --> 04:23:10,959
I'm going to wait until he turns around.

1884
04:23:10,959 --> 04:23:11,280
Wait, hold on.

1885
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:11,680
Can I...

1886
04:23:11,680 --> 04:23:13,979
Well, keep looking.

1887
04:23:32,170 --> 04:23:33,770
Trying to do the Batman attack.

1888
04:23:37,850 --> 04:23:39,209
Am I actually supposed to do that?

1889
04:23:53,260 --> 04:23:54,139
Grab the bars.

1890
04:23:57,440 --> 04:23:58,479
There's no prompt, though.

1891
04:23:58,479 --> 04:23:58,799
All right.

1892
04:24:00,030 --> 04:24:01,549
No more hubris.

1893
04:24:01,549 --> 04:24:02,750
No more fucking around.

1894
04:24:02,750 --> 04:24:03,790
No more hubris.

1895
04:24:05,420 --> 04:24:07,500
Just go on the bars.

1896
04:24:16,920 --> 04:24:18,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1897
04:24:18,760 --> 04:24:19,239
The pit.

1898
04:24:19,239 --> 04:24:19,559
I know.

1899
04:24:20,299 --> 04:24:21,659
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1900
04:24:21,659 --> 04:24:22,379
It's wild.

1901
04:24:22,379 --> 04:24:23,739
Can you believe what this guy Riddick did?

1902
04:24:24,700 --> 04:24:26,219
Yeah, I heard if he takes his glasses off,

1903
04:24:26,219 --> 04:24:28,620
there's a big red ray that shoots out of his eyes.

1904
04:24:47,180 --> 04:24:47,420
What?

1905
04:24:49,229 --> 04:24:49,389
What?

1906
04:24:49,870 --> 04:24:50,430
Wow, what?

1907
04:24:51,229 --> 04:24:53,639
Did I drop?

1908
04:24:55,879 --> 04:24:57,079
Oh my god.

1909
04:25:04,590 --> 04:25:06,430
Everything was so blurry.

1910
04:25:08,399 --> 04:25:10,159
I tried to keep going and he turned around.

1911
04:25:25,680 --> 04:25:27,120
He has to be pretending.

1912
04:25:28,969 --> 04:25:30,569
Adjust your TV screen.

1913
04:25:44,190 --> 04:25:44,829
What happened?

1914
04:25:57,850 --> 04:26:00,409
Oh, who even shot at me?

1915
04:26:00,409 --> 04:26:01,129
I don't...

1916
04:26:01,129 --> 04:26:01,690
This guy?

1917
04:26:02,569 --> 04:26:08,000
Dude, he just ripped through one of his teammates.

1918
04:26:08,000 --> 04:26:09,360
He didn't even give a shit.

1919
04:26:10,079 --> 04:26:11,440
He blew that guy away.

1920
04:26:11,440 --> 04:26:12,799
He fucking murdered him.

1921
04:26:34,680 --> 04:26:50,559
Oh, did he forget?

1922
04:26:50,559 --> 04:26:51,920
Okay, now where?

1923
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:55,440
Dude, okay.

1924
04:26:55,440 --> 04:26:58,139
I don't understand why it's doing this.

1925
04:27:01,520 --> 04:27:02,479
Press left.

1926
04:27:02,479 --> 04:27:02,799
Left.

1927
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:04,000
Left.

1928
04:27:04,959 --> 04:27:06,559
I'm forward?

1929
04:27:06,559 --> 04:27:08,000
Okay, that's real dumb.

1930
04:27:08,719 --> 04:27:09,520
Why would they do that?

1931
04:27:13,319 --> 04:27:14,040
It's not left.

1932
04:27:14,040 --> 04:27:15,159
You have to hold up.

1933
04:27:15,159 --> 04:27:20,250
Where the hell am I now?

1934
04:27:23,229 --> 04:27:25,549
Oh no, but what if I cannot see where I'm going?

1935
04:27:25,549 --> 04:27:26,670
I've landed in a vault.

1936
04:27:27,229 --> 04:27:29,469
I get to bring that one back from like 2017.

1937
04:27:29,469 --> 04:27:33,950
But where am I actually though?

1938
04:27:33,950 --> 04:27:48,620
But I could go up, right?

1939
04:27:48,620 --> 04:27:55,100
I'm going to see me up here.

1940
04:27:55,739 --> 04:28:07,440
Is this...

1941
04:28:07,440 --> 04:28:08,399
Oh my god.

1942
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:26,159
Oh, don't fall in there.

1943
04:28:26,159 --> 04:28:33,930
Was that hard?

1944
04:28:33,930 --> 04:28:34,809
Yeah, it was.

1945
04:28:34,809 --> 04:28:37,370
Because I was trying to press the up.

1946
04:28:37,370 --> 04:28:39,629
You have to press up instead of the left.

1947
04:28:39,629 --> 04:28:41,149
And the whole thing gets blurry.

1948
04:28:41,149 --> 04:28:50,159
Hey, look, this game was made in 2004, okay?

1949
04:28:50,159 --> 04:28:52,959
It doesn't have the same quality of life improvements

1950
04:28:52,959 --> 04:28:54,319
that we have in like 2020.

1951
04:29:13,120 --> 04:29:14,639
You can see me in here?

1952
04:29:14,639 --> 04:29:24,239
There's two.

1953
04:29:24,940 --> 04:29:25,979
Oh, they're not...

1954
04:29:25,979 --> 04:29:39,770
There's a guy in front of me too.

1955
04:29:39,770 --> 04:29:47,500
There's a guy straight ahead.

1956
04:29:47,500 --> 04:29:47,899
Fuck it.

1957
04:29:47,899 --> 04:29:48,540
You know what I mean?

1958
04:29:48,540 --> 04:29:49,340
Just go.

1959
04:29:49,340 --> 04:29:57,180
All right, guy up ahead.

1960
04:29:57,180 --> 04:30:01,200
I need a repair kit thing.

1961
04:30:01,200 --> 04:30:04,090
Should I jump?

1962
04:30:04,090 --> 04:30:04,729
Oh shit.

1963
04:30:07,520 --> 04:30:08,879
Oh my goodness.

1964
04:30:08,879 --> 04:30:19,309
Should I wait for him to...

1965
04:30:19,309 --> 04:30:21,229
All right, I'm going to try to go kill this guy.

1966
04:30:21,229 --> 04:30:22,430
Should I jump down and break his neck?

1967
04:30:23,930 --> 04:30:25,209
He might be the only one on there.

1968
04:30:25,209 --> 04:30:27,340
I think he's the only one down here.

1969
04:30:27,340 --> 04:30:34,809
I thought that was a person.

1970
04:30:35,370 --> 04:30:36,569
Wait, should I go now?

1971
04:30:36,569 --> 04:30:37,530
Should I just go now?

1972
04:30:38,090 --> 04:30:38,989
I don't think I can.

1973
04:30:39,549 --> 04:30:39,870
No, no, no.

1974
04:30:39,870 --> 04:30:41,149
I'm going to wait till he turns.

1975
04:30:41,149 --> 04:30:44,329
This is the loser's point of view.

1976
04:30:45,129 --> 04:30:45,930
What'd you notice?

1977
04:30:45,930 --> 04:30:47,049
You didn't notice anything.

1978
04:30:47,049 --> 04:30:48,809
What the fuck are you talking about?

1979
04:30:48,809 --> 04:30:49,930
You noticed what?

1980
04:30:50,729 --> 04:30:56,520
All right, motherfucker.

1981
04:30:56,520 --> 04:30:57,159
I'm done with you.

1982
04:30:57,879 --> 04:30:58,760
I've had it.

1983
04:31:19,280 --> 04:31:20,079
Don't keep looking.

1984
04:31:20,079 --> 04:31:20,719
Okay, there he is.

1985
04:31:28,700 --> 04:31:29,340
Just go?

1986
04:31:29,340 --> 04:31:30,540
You can't just go.

1987
04:31:31,930 --> 04:31:32,729
Do you see?

1988
04:31:32,729 --> 04:31:33,209
What?

1989
04:31:33,209 --> 04:31:33,770
Just go?

1990
04:31:34,489 --> 04:31:35,370
Just go.

1991
04:31:35,370 --> 04:31:36,569
All right, ban that guy for life.

1992
04:31:52,379 --> 04:31:53,819
I can run faster than the bullets.

1993
04:31:53,819 --> 04:31:54,219
Fuck it.

1994
04:32:09,370 --> 04:32:11,129
He's going to ban him for life.

1995
04:32:14,520 --> 04:32:16,840
Hey, don't shine it on my fucking face.

1996
04:32:16,840 --> 04:32:17,559
All right, this guy.

1997
04:32:17,559 --> 04:32:18,360
I got to...

1998
04:32:18,360 --> 04:32:19,129
Holy shit.

1999
04:32:19,129 --> 04:32:20,329
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

2000
04:32:20,329 --> 04:32:21,850
Get through, get through, get through, get through, get through.

2001
04:32:29,850 --> 04:32:30,250
This is...

2002
04:32:31,450 --> 04:32:32,569
You got to go.

2003
04:32:32,569 --> 04:32:33,370
Are you serious?

2004
04:32:38,030 --> 04:32:38,989
You can do it?

2005
04:32:38,989 --> 04:32:41,469
Well, I need a healing location.

2006
04:32:42,110 --> 04:33:03,879
All right, so there's a guy here.

2007
04:33:03,879 --> 04:33:04,759
There's a guy here.

2008
04:33:07,439 --> 04:33:09,759
This dude right here is a pain in my ass.

2009
04:33:09,759 --> 04:33:12,240
And I can't get out here without him hearing me.

2010
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:13,919
So, I've got to be very quick about it.

2011
04:33:13,919 --> 04:33:15,520
And I've got to Batman kill this guy.

2012
04:33:15,520 --> 04:33:16,080
Are you ready?

2013
04:33:21,389 --> 04:33:21,869
What?

2014
04:33:34,060 --> 04:33:39,819
That was a tuber reaction.

2015
04:33:39,819 --> 04:33:40,700
No, that was a...

2016
04:33:40,700 --> 04:33:41,419
Sure.

2017
04:33:41,419 --> 04:33:44,080
I was really annoying.

2018
04:33:44,080 --> 04:33:44,799
Whatever it was.

2019
04:33:47,580 --> 04:33:48,380
Oh, fuck.

2020
04:33:54,080 --> 04:33:55,360
Why would you climb that?

2021
04:33:56,000 --> 04:34:02,200
You guys want me to play this on hard.

2022
04:34:02,200 --> 04:34:03,880
Oh, no fucking way.

2023
04:34:04,520 --> 04:34:27,630
Maybe I'm going to go...

2024
04:34:27,630 --> 04:34:28,909
I'm going to make sure I go the other way.

2025
04:34:39,900 --> 04:34:40,139
Okay.

2026
04:34:42,319 --> 04:34:44,159
Am I lit up like a Christmas tree?

2027
04:34:44,720 --> 04:34:45,419
Am I just...

2028
04:34:46,060 --> 04:34:46,860
Am I...

2029
04:34:46,860 --> 04:34:47,900
Can they see my eyes?

2030
04:34:48,299 --> 04:34:51,450
Why can they see me from so far away?

2031
04:34:51,450 --> 04:35:01,360
What's the game plan here?

2032
04:35:01,360 --> 04:35:05,610
Do I have to get out of the window or something?

2033
04:35:18,270 --> 04:35:18,909
Just go.

2034
04:35:19,709 --> 04:35:20,189
Don't...

2035
04:35:20,189 --> 04:35:21,630
Don't listen to them.

2036
04:35:21,630 --> 04:35:25,180
All right.

2037
04:35:25,180 --> 04:35:25,979
Where is this dude?

2038
04:35:25,979 --> 04:35:26,459
There he is.

2039
04:35:26,459 --> 04:35:27,180
Okay.

2040
04:35:27,180 --> 04:35:29,930
I wish I could quietly jump out a fucking window.

2041
04:35:30,490 --> 04:35:47,529
The goal is to get to the other side over here.

2042
04:35:47,529 --> 04:35:49,150
Is he still there?

2043
04:35:50,110 --> 04:35:50,430
Okay.

2044
04:35:50,430 --> 04:35:51,950
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2045
04:35:51,950 --> 04:35:53,790
What the fuck was that turn?

2046
04:35:56,599 --> 04:35:58,200
That was an instant turn.

2047
04:36:05,610 --> 04:36:06,330
I'm ready.

2048
04:36:06,330 --> 04:36:06,729
Hold on.

2049
04:36:07,290 --> 04:36:08,590
I'm currently invisible.

2050
04:36:09,150 --> 04:36:11,119
But is he still there?

2051
04:36:12,000 --> 04:36:12,720
Oh my...

2052
04:36:13,759 --> 04:36:14,959
The other guy is here now.

2053
04:36:14,959 --> 04:36:15,200
All right.

2054
04:36:15,200 --> 04:36:16,400
This is my opportunity to go.

2055
04:36:16,400 --> 04:36:16,639
Right?

2056
04:36:26,810 --> 04:36:27,290
Fuck off.

2057
04:36:35,040 --> 04:36:37,279
Oh.

2058
04:36:37,279 --> 04:36:40,040
Oh.

2059
04:36:40,040 --> 04:36:42,409
Oh.

2060
04:36:42,409 --> 04:36:43,130
Oh.

2061
04:36:43,130 --> 04:36:43,689
Oh.

2062
04:36:52,000 --> 04:36:52,959
Is that guy facing...

2063
04:36:52,959 --> 04:36:54,479
What direction is he facing?

2064
04:36:54,479 --> 04:36:57,930
Did I save him?

2065
04:36:58,569 --> 04:37:02,400
All right.

2066
04:37:02,400 --> 04:37:02,880
I saved him.

2067
04:37:17,180 --> 04:37:27,020
Okay.

2068
04:37:27,020 --> 04:37:27,340
Thanks.

2069
04:37:32,479 --> 04:37:33,200
Sharpshooter.

2070
04:37:38,200 --> 04:37:38,759
All right.

2071
04:37:38,759 --> 04:37:40,439
There's a sharpshooter guard over here.

2072
04:37:47,819 --> 04:37:48,779
Is that the guy?

2073
04:37:55,959 --> 04:37:56,200
Okay.

2074
04:37:57,000 --> 04:37:58,759
I have to make it past this without dying.

2075
04:38:00,279 --> 04:38:00,759
Wait.

2076
04:38:00,759 --> 04:38:01,400
I don't know what this is.

2077
04:38:01,400 --> 04:38:01,720
Turn it.

2078
04:38:02,840 --> 04:38:03,159
Gas.

2079
04:38:03,959 --> 04:38:07,020
I don't know what I'm gassing.

2080
04:38:07,740 --> 04:38:10,029
I got the card.

2081
04:38:10,029 --> 04:38:10,270
Okay.

2082
04:38:10,270 --> 04:38:10,509
Bye.

2083
04:38:11,819 --> 04:38:12,060
Hey.

2084
04:38:12,060 --> 04:38:12,380
Hey!

2085
04:38:12,380 --> 04:38:12,619
Hey!

2086
04:38:13,740 --> 04:38:14,380
What are you doing?

2087
04:38:15,099 --> 04:38:17,659
What's he fighting me for?

2088
04:38:17,659 --> 04:38:18,860
I didn't do anything.

2089
04:38:18,860 --> 04:38:36,240
What do you mean I aggroed him?

2090
04:38:36,240 --> 04:38:37,200
What are you talking about?

2091
04:38:49,819 --> 04:38:50,139
Wait.

2092
04:38:50,139 --> 04:38:52,299
Didn't I have to club out when I talked to him the first time?

2093
04:38:53,180 --> 04:39:04,860
Okay.

2094
04:39:04,860 --> 04:39:05,340
Cool.

2095
04:39:05,340 --> 04:39:05,740
Now what?

2096
04:39:06,619 --> 04:39:14,299
All right.

2097
04:39:14,299 --> 04:39:14,939
Place your bets.

2098
04:39:14,939 --> 04:39:17,099
Is it going to crush me on the ceiling if I get on this?

2099
04:39:17,819 --> 04:39:50,139
I just had to be sure about it.

2100
04:39:50,700 --> 04:39:54,270
All right.

2101
04:39:54,270 --> 04:39:54,990
I don't think this...

2102
04:39:54,990 --> 04:39:56,830
I really don't think this fall damage in this game.

2103
04:39:56,830 --> 04:39:57,470
I don't think there is.

2104
04:40:07,259 --> 04:40:07,900
Just a little.

2105
04:40:07,900 --> 04:40:08,139
Okay.

2106
04:40:08,139 --> 04:40:09,020
So now from here...

2107
04:40:17,500 --> 04:40:19,680
Lord...

2108
04:40:19,680 --> 04:40:19,919
Oh.

2109
04:40:20,700 --> 04:40:21,259
Right.

2110
04:40:21,259 --> 04:40:21,580
Okay.

2111
04:40:34,540 --> 04:40:35,099
Third floor.

2112
04:40:35,740 --> 04:40:45,740
What's that?

2113
04:40:45,740 --> 04:40:49,369
It can go up even higher.

2114
04:40:50,009 --> 04:40:52,909
Is there anything up here?

2115
04:40:52,909 --> 04:41:01,610
Is it just here for no reason?

2116
04:41:01,610 --> 04:41:03,759
Okay.

2117
04:41:03,759 --> 04:41:04,400
Well, that's dumb.

2118
04:41:06,250 --> 04:41:07,130
Mine entrance.

2119
04:41:17,819 --> 04:41:23,849
Ventilation hatch.

2120
04:41:29,020 --> 04:41:30,220
I think I just used the tool, right?

2121
04:41:32,729 --> 04:41:33,290
Sick.

2122
04:41:33,290 --> 04:41:40,970
What are my thoughts on duck meat?

2123
04:41:40,970 --> 04:41:42,330
I don't really eat it.

2124
04:41:42,330 --> 04:41:48,509
I'm not a big fan.

2125
04:41:58,759 --> 04:42:05,200
What the hell is this for?

2126
04:42:19,389 --> 04:42:32,000
It looks like a half-life map.

2127
04:42:37,290 --> 04:42:45,080
Now where the hell am I?

2128
04:42:45,479 --> 04:42:45,799
All right.

2129
04:42:45,799 --> 04:42:46,040
I'm...

2130
04:42:47,000 --> 04:42:49,790
Is it an elevator?

2131
04:42:52,060 --> 04:42:52,779
Am I getting this?

2132
04:43:00,330 --> 04:43:19,479
Okay.

2133
04:43:19,479 --> 04:43:21,720
Deeper down to the mining core.

2134
04:43:21,720 --> 04:43:25,500
This is not the mining core.

2135
04:43:26,060 --> 04:43:33,529
So why did I go in this vent?

2136
04:43:33,529 --> 04:43:34,729
What the hell did I go in the vent for?

2137
04:43:35,529 --> 04:43:41,470
Is that like a shortcut to get back?

2138
04:43:59,150 --> 04:44:00,909
He could have skipped all of that.

2139
04:44:03,130 --> 04:44:03,689
Hey, James.

2140
04:44:03,689 --> 04:44:05,130
Thanks for the 10 community subs.

2141
04:44:05,130 --> 04:44:11,740
Appreciate it.

2142
04:44:11,740 --> 04:44:12,299
Thank you.

2143
04:44:12,299 --> 04:44:16,970
Well, it saved it again.

2144
04:44:18,860 --> 04:44:19,180
Great.

2145
04:44:20,830 --> 04:44:21,069
Wait.

2146
04:44:21,069 --> 04:44:22,270
There's a person out here.

2147
04:44:22,270 --> 04:44:23,229
Did they not see that?

2148
04:44:23,229 --> 04:44:25,389
He's gonna just fire a gun in the vent at me.

2149
04:44:26,189 --> 04:44:26,590
God.

2150
04:44:27,470 --> 04:44:34,590
This is the worst possible place to be right now.

2151
04:44:35,790 --> 04:44:36,909
I can't get out there.

2152
04:44:39,130 --> 04:44:40,250
This is sitting duck.

2153
04:44:40,250 --> 04:44:41,209
This is the worst.

2154
04:44:48,250 --> 04:44:49,209
I can't even run.

2155
04:44:50,009 --> 04:45:00,250
Okay.

2156
04:45:00,250 --> 04:45:00,970
Well, now I...

2157
04:45:01,529 --> 04:45:02,970
There's a guy here.

2158
04:45:02,970 --> 04:45:04,939
Let's wait for the guy to go by

2159
04:45:04,939 --> 04:45:07,099
so I don't kick the grate in front of him.

2160
04:45:07,099 --> 04:45:10,979
He...

2161
04:45:11,439 --> 04:45:12,319
He heard it.

2162
04:45:14,409 --> 04:45:15,610
He doesn't care.

2163
04:45:15,610 --> 04:45:15,849
All right.

2164
04:45:15,849 --> 04:45:16,250
Where am I?

2165
04:45:16,250 --> 04:45:16,650
Where am I?

2166
04:45:16,650 --> 04:45:16,970
Where am I?

2167
04:45:16,970 --> 04:45:17,290
Where am I?

2168
04:45:17,290 --> 04:45:17,689
Where am I?

2169
04:45:17,689 --> 04:45:18,409
I don't know where I am.

2170
04:45:18,409 --> 04:45:18,970
Where am I?

2171
04:45:19,529 --> 04:45:20,430
Where am I?

2172
04:45:20,430 --> 04:45:20,750
Wait.

2173
04:45:21,470 --> 04:45:32,700
Give me a key card on you.

2174
04:45:35,759 --> 04:45:35,919
I...

2175
04:45:35,919 --> 04:45:40,959
This is new.

2176
04:45:41,759 --> 04:45:51,389
Oh, this sucks.

2177
04:45:51,389 --> 04:45:51,630
Wait.

2178
04:45:51,630 --> 04:45:51,869
There's a...

2179
04:46:00,880 --> 04:46:02,720
Through like another dream tunnel.

2180
04:46:02,720 --> 04:46:10,110
Hell am I going?

2181
04:46:10,110 --> 04:46:23,560
Nothing here.

2182
04:46:23,560 --> 04:46:26,220
Keep looking.

2183
04:46:26,220 --> 04:46:26,540
What?

2184
04:46:30,459 --> 04:46:31,419
I don't know where he is.

2185
04:46:31,419 --> 04:46:31,900
Found him.

2186
04:46:32,540 --> 04:46:33,259
He's up there.

2187
04:46:34,560 --> 04:46:35,119
Oh, I...

2188
04:46:35,680 --> 04:46:36,639
I'm leaning is...

2189
04:46:38,009 --> 04:46:38,330
All right.

2190
04:46:38,330 --> 04:46:38,810
You know what?

2191
04:46:38,810 --> 04:46:39,130
Fuck it.

2192
04:46:39,130 --> 04:46:40,009
I'm going this way.

2193
04:46:43,639 --> 04:46:44,040
Okay.

2194
04:46:46,349 --> 04:46:46,830
What's up?

2195
04:47:03,069 --> 04:47:03,790
Holy shit.

2196
04:47:03,790 --> 04:47:05,869
I ground that guy up.

2197
04:47:05,869 --> 04:47:06,750
I gotta turn the fan off.

2198
04:47:07,310 --> 04:47:07,549
Wait.

2199
04:47:07,549 --> 04:47:08,029
The fan's off.

2200
04:47:08,029 --> 04:47:09,069
There's a body in it.

2201
04:47:09,069 --> 04:47:17,020
Should I go in?

2202
04:47:17,020 --> 04:47:18,009
Okay.

2203
04:47:18,009 --> 04:47:18,889
I'm going in.

2204
04:47:18,889 --> 04:47:44,200
I did it.

2205
04:47:44,200 --> 04:47:49,470
Wait a minute.

2206
04:47:49,470 --> 04:47:56,540
Wait.

2207
04:47:56,540 --> 04:47:58,880
This is the fan the guy was looking...

2208
04:47:58,880 --> 04:48:00,080
Why did that matter?

2209
04:48:00,080 --> 04:48:03,279
Why did that matter?

2210
04:48:03,279 --> 04:48:08,040
I want to turn that fan off.

2211
04:48:08,040 --> 04:48:09,159
Like go in the fan.

2212
04:48:09,159 --> 04:48:10,040
What happened?

2213
04:48:10,040 --> 04:48:18,169
Security check.

2214
04:48:18,169 --> 04:48:18,490
Wait.

2215
04:48:18,490 --> 04:48:19,369
I was already in here.

2216
04:48:19,930 --> 04:48:34,560
Am I fucked?

2217
04:48:34,560 --> 04:48:34,799
Yeah.

2218
04:48:34,799 --> 04:48:39,119
I think I am.

2219
04:48:39,119 --> 04:48:39,759
Just run?

2220
04:48:41,470 --> 04:48:42,110
Wait.

2221
04:48:42,110 --> 04:48:42,430
Did I...

2222
04:48:42,430 --> 04:48:44,189
I went through the entire...

2223
04:48:44,189 --> 04:48:45,549
Was that like the exit?

2224
04:48:45,549 --> 04:48:47,310
You leave and when you're done?

2225
04:48:47,310 --> 04:49:00,159
I can't just go.

2226
04:49:00,159 --> 04:49:01,599
I can't just go.

2227
04:49:01,680 --> 04:49:02,240
I can't.

2228
04:49:05,599 --> 04:49:06,880
Go back to the elevator.

2229
04:49:06,880 --> 04:49:07,680
Okay.

2230
04:49:07,680 --> 04:49:17,000
So go back to the elevator?

2231
04:49:17,000 --> 04:49:17,799
God damn it.

2232
04:49:22,509 --> 04:49:23,869
Where's the elevator from here?

2233
04:49:25,549 --> 04:49:29,319
What the hell am I even doing in the mines in the first place?

2234
04:49:29,319 --> 04:49:30,599
What the hell am I doing here?

2235
04:49:31,240 --> 04:49:36,939
Do I have a code for this?

2236
04:49:37,500 --> 04:49:42,250
Oh fuck you.

2237
04:49:45,290 --> 04:49:46,330
Can I get up there?

2238
04:49:46,970 --> 04:49:49,500
Is there a way I can get up there?

2239
04:49:49,500 --> 04:49:50,299
Like jump up there?

2240
04:49:50,860 --> 04:49:52,779
Because I want to be up there.

2241
04:50:13,319 --> 04:50:14,840
I'm fucking confused as hell.

2242
04:50:15,639 --> 04:50:22,279
It also doesn't feel like that I have...

2243
04:50:22,279 --> 04:50:24,119
It also doesn't help that I feel like I have a concussion.

2244
04:50:24,119 --> 04:50:24,919
When I'm playing this game.

2245
04:50:42,669 --> 04:50:44,830
Star's D&D campaign was cancelled today.

2246
04:50:44,830 --> 04:50:46,750
So I'm going to peel off the sunburn and eat it.

2247
04:50:47,470 --> 04:50:48,799
It's pretty gross dude.

2248
04:50:51,680 --> 04:50:52,319
All right.

2249
04:50:52,319 --> 04:50:53,040
We're back here.

2250
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:53,520
We're good.

2251
04:50:56,220 --> 04:50:57,099
Didn't I kill this guy?

2252
04:50:57,819 --> 04:51:06,880
Apparently not.

2253
04:51:08,509 --> 04:51:08,750
All right.

2254
04:51:08,750 --> 04:51:09,470
We're back here.

2255
04:51:10,520 --> 04:51:12,200
So now I went up.

2256
04:51:12,200 --> 04:51:13,639
I'm not going to go up in that vent.

2257
04:51:14,360 --> 04:51:15,159
What is over here?

2258
04:51:15,720 --> 04:51:20,959
First thing I need...

2259
04:51:24,299 --> 04:51:25,819
I have to go deeper into the mine.

2260
04:51:25,819 --> 04:51:27,340
Not climb around in vents.

2261
04:51:28,060 --> 04:51:34,990
Go the other way in the vent.

2262
04:51:38,560 --> 04:51:40,400
Yeah people must think I'm really really stupid.

2263
04:51:40,799 --> 04:51:42,560
Because I'm not touching the guns but I can't.

2264
04:51:43,119 --> 04:51:43,360
Okay.

2265
04:51:43,360 --> 04:51:43,840
So that's...

2266
04:51:43,840 --> 04:51:45,119
We're going this way?

2267
04:51:45,840 --> 04:51:54,939
That's just the door.

2268
04:51:57,020 --> 04:52:00,060
I went in that vent right there.

2269
04:52:00,060 --> 04:52:01,180
No this is not right.

2270
04:52:14,509 --> 04:52:15,310
Okay.

2271
04:52:15,310 --> 04:52:20,319
So here we are again.

2272
04:52:20,319 --> 04:52:21,599
Is there another vent?

2273
04:52:21,599 --> 04:52:22,799
Can I climb anything?

2274
04:52:25,419 --> 04:52:26,380
Because there's nothing here.

2275
04:52:26,939 --> 04:52:30,200
There's a tunnel in between the vents.

2276
04:52:30,200 --> 04:52:30,439
Wait.

2277
04:52:31,400 --> 04:52:31,720
Hold on.

2278
04:52:31,720 --> 04:52:32,599
Let me just check this.

2279
04:52:33,319 --> 04:52:34,759
Because I just jumped right in after this.

2280
04:52:34,759 --> 04:52:35,720
Surface panel?

2281
04:52:35,720 --> 04:52:37,000
Oh come on now.

2282
04:52:37,959 --> 04:52:38,840
Come on now.

2283
04:52:39,479 --> 04:52:57,919
I turned off the fan and now he is pretending.

2284
04:52:58,959 --> 04:53:02,349
I don't know how you would like know what to do here.

2285
04:53:03,229 --> 04:53:11,639
Jump up fan?

2286
04:53:13,549 --> 04:53:14,029
No.

2287
04:53:14,029 --> 04:53:17,549
Down the fan.

2288
04:53:17,549 --> 04:53:20,430
No I went down the fan last time and it was a big mistake.

2289
04:53:20,430 --> 04:53:22,000
There's nothing on...

2290
04:53:22,880 --> 04:53:25,200
Wait is there like a vent in the middle of fans or something?

2291
04:53:25,840 --> 04:53:31,819
Is there another way to go up here?

2292
04:53:35,360 --> 04:53:36,319
Use the panel again.

2293
04:53:36,880 --> 04:53:48,439
Go back in the vent.

2294
04:53:49,080 --> 04:53:53,130
Is there another vent that I can go in that's not this one?

2295
04:53:55,049 --> 04:53:55,930
Back through the vent.

2296
04:53:56,650 --> 04:54:02,220
Okay.

2297
04:54:02,220 --> 04:54:02,619
This is...

2298
04:54:03,419 --> 04:54:06,360
There's no other way to go.

2299
04:54:07,080 --> 04:54:11,000
I mean remember I kicked this and I freaked out?

2300
04:54:11,639 --> 04:54:12,619
Wait there's another...

2301
04:54:14,840 --> 04:54:15,080
Wait.

2302
04:54:15,639 --> 04:54:16,040
This is...

2303
04:54:21,880 --> 04:54:22,919
Vent Andy?

2304
04:54:23,639 --> 04:54:39,880
What?

2305
04:54:39,880 --> 04:54:41,450
No this is just...

2306
04:54:41,450 --> 04:54:41,689
I'm...

2307
04:54:42,250 --> 04:54:44,220
This is just where I was.

2308
04:54:44,220 --> 04:54:45,419
I have no idea where to go.

2309
04:54:45,419 --> 04:54:46,729
I don't know what to do.

2310
04:54:46,729 --> 04:54:58,509
You can use the service panel to turn the lights off so you can get past the robot.

2311
04:54:59,959 --> 04:55:00,919
Didn't I just do that?

2312
04:55:00,919 --> 04:55:01,959
I just did that though right?

2313
04:55:02,520 --> 04:55:05,520
Hold on.

2314
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:06,400
I just did that right?

2315
04:55:07,040 --> 04:55:08,799
So technically...

2316
04:55:09,279 --> 04:55:09,520
I...

2317
04:55:09,520 --> 04:55:10,560
Wait that's a lie.

2318
04:55:10,560 --> 04:55:10,799
Okay.

2319
04:55:13,549 --> 04:55:14,189
Sides dot...

2320
04:55:14,189 --> 04:55:14,990
Hold on there's a guide.

2321
04:55:14,990 --> 04:55:15,549
What does it say?

2322
04:55:16,110 --> 04:55:17,709
Has this been nothing like a screamer or something?

2323
04:55:17,709 --> 04:55:18,509
I'm gonna be pissed if it is.

2324
04:55:23,200 --> 04:55:23,599
Okay.

2325
04:55:23,599 --> 04:55:24,080
Once you're...

2326
04:55:25,040 --> 04:55:27,119
Yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay okay.

2327
04:55:27,919 --> 04:55:31,389
Ignore the door at the end of this hall.

2328
04:55:31,389 --> 04:55:32,430
Go back to the junction.

2329
04:55:33,310 --> 04:55:35,790
Once the guard has been taken care of talk to the inmate.

2330
04:55:35,790 --> 04:55:38,270
Mosley will tell you about a possible way to get into the mines.

2331
04:55:38,270 --> 04:55:39,069
You probably know this by now.

2332
04:55:39,069 --> 04:55:40,349
He's one of the blue skins.

2333
04:55:40,349 --> 04:55:43,069
As a result kill him when you end the conversation.

2334
04:55:43,069 --> 04:55:45,310
This can be done easily by standing behind him and killing him.

2335
04:55:45,389 --> 04:55:47,549
Go back to the junction and choose a door to your left.

2336
04:55:47,549 --> 04:55:48,669
You'll have to be extremely careful here.

2337
04:55:48,669 --> 04:55:50,669
Because his entire court is being controlled by one of the guards.

2338
04:55:52,569 --> 04:55:52,810
Okay.

2339
04:55:54,240 --> 04:55:54,799
Check his body.

2340
04:55:54,799 --> 04:55:56,799
There's a key card on his body.

2341
04:55:56,799 --> 04:55:58,220
All right we're gonna go find Mosley.

2342
04:55:58,220 --> 04:56:00,299
We're gonna go to the door on the left and find the key card.

2343
04:56:00,299 --> 04:56:01,099
Wait I already did that.

2344
04:56:03,979 --> 04:56:05,259
Explore the upper balcony.

2345
04:56:12,959 --> 04:56:15,360
Just watch the ending on YouTube.

2346
04:56:15,360 --> 04:56:15,599
No!

2347
04:56:16,319 --> 04:56:17,720
Where was that guy?

2348
04:56:18,360 --> 04:56:24,880
This doesn't sound anywhere near where I am.

2349
04:56:25,599 --> 04:56:33,020
I'm not gonna watch the ending on YouTube.

2350
04:56:33,020 --> 04:56:33,979
Why would I do that?

2351
04:56:35,610 --> 04:56:36,729
I'm going in the...

2352
04:56:36,729 --> 04:56:36,970
Wait.

2353
04:56:37,529 --> 04:56:38,250
What's this?

2354
04:56:38,970 --> 04:56:39,450
What's that?

2355
04:56:40,250 --> 04:56:40,650
This is...

2356
04:56:40,650 --> 04:56:41,930
I think this is like a vent I can go in.

2357
04:56:41,930 --> 04:56:42,330
Look at this.

2358
04:56:42,889 --> 04:56:46,430
There's two vents?

2359
04:56:46,430 --> 04:56:46,669
No.

2360
04:56:48,700 --> 04:56:50,299
The link was two or three pages.

2361
04:56:50,299 --> 04:56:50,779
Wait, wait, wait.

2362
04:56:50,779 --> 04:56:51,099
Hold on.

2363
04:56:51,819 --> 04:56:54,279
Okay.

2364
04:56:54,279 --> 04:56:54,680
Hold on.

2365
04:56:54,680 --> 04:56:54,919
Okay.

2366
04:56:54,919 --> 04:56:55,720
There's the elevator.

2367
04:57:05,610 --> 04:57:06,409
Oh Jesus.

2368
04:57:07,310 --> 04:57:07,630
This is...

2369
04:57:08,270 --> 04:57:09,310
This is not right.

2370
04:57:09,950 --> 04:57:14,700
Turn around and stand in front of the right elevator shaft.

2371
04:57:14,700 --> 04:57:17,419
Wait for a small platform to appear above you and jump on it when it's close enough.

2372
04:57:17,419 --> 04:57:19,259
You must now wait to be transported to a lower...

2373
04:57:24,189 --> 04:57:24,509
Okay.

2374
04:57:25,439 --> 04:57:26,880
We gotta go back to the elevator.

2375
04:57:26,880 --> 04:57:27,520
I...

2376
04:57:27,520 --> 04:57:28,319
This is all wrong.

2377
04:57:30,080 --> 04:57:33,360
Back to that elevator and go down instead of up.

2378
04:57:33,360 --> 04:57:39,470
All right.

2379
04:57:39,470 --> 04:57:41,069
Where the hell is that elevator from here?

2380
04:57:45,450 --> 04:57:47,709
Power, security, work...

2381
04:57:47,709 --> 04:57:48,270
I don't know.

2382
04:57:48,909 --> 04:57:51,560
Where's that fucking elevator?

2383
04:57:51,560 --> 04:57:53,159
I have no clue where that elevator is.

2384
04:58:02,009 --> 04:58:02,810
Nice map.

2385
04:58:02,810 --> 04:58:03,689
Should I just start over?

2386
04:58:04,330 --> 04:58:09,520
He doesn't know.

2387
04:58:11,470 --> 04:58:12,990
Dump down the fan and go to the elevator.

2388
04:58:14,299 --> 04:58:15,020
All right.

2389
04:58:15,020 --> 04:58:34,880
Are the elevators right here?

2390
04:58:34,880 --> 04:58:35,840
I just have to do this, right?

2391
04:58:39,529 --> 04:58:40,409
What do you...

2392
04:58:40,409 --> 04:58:40,650
What?

2393
04:58:41,209 --> 04:58:49,119
Wait, no, no.

2394
04:58:49,119 --> 04:58:50,720
I have to go this to the...

2395
04:58:50,720 --> 04:58:51,439
Right.

2396
04:58:51,439 --> 04:58:51,759
No.

2397
04:58:51,759 --> 04:58:52,240
Okay, okay.

2398
04:58:52,240 --> 04:58:52,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2399
04:58:52,720 --> 04:58:54,400
But wait, does this take me to where I want to go?

2400
04:58:54,799 --> 04:58:58,889
Through the elevator thing?

2401
04:58:59,450 --> 04:59:01,549
This map is kind of a mess.

2402
04:59:15,279 --> 04:59:15,919
Okay.

2403
04:59:15,919 --> 04:59:19,979
Should I use it or should I climb up through the vents?

2404
04:59:21,290 --> 04:59:21,849
You missed it.

2405
04:59:21,849 --> 04:59:22,729
You're going backwards?

2406
04:59:23,290 --> 04:59:26,400
Wait, what?

2407
04:59:26,400 --> 04:59:27,279
Wrong elevator.

2408
04:59:27,840 --> 04:59:30,639
This is the bridge you couldn't get the gun on.

2409
04:59:30,639 --> 04:59:31,520
You were already here.

2410
04:59:32,080 --> 04:59:33,279
I walked past it.

2411
04:59:33,279 --> 04:59:33,840
What do you mean?

2412
04:59:33,840 --> 04:59:34,080
How?

2413
04:59:34,880 --> 04:59:41,340
I can't use this thing.

2414
04:59:41,979 --> 04:59:52,560
You need to go to the elevator that you got squished in.

2415
04:59:52,560 --> 04:59:53,439
Yeah, isn't it...

2416
04:59:53,439 --> 04:59:56,639
Don't I have to go through here though and like stealth to the left and climb up that thing?

2417
05:00:03,200 --> 05:00:03,919
Yeah, that's what I...

2418
05:00:04,639 --> 05:00:05,279
No.

2419
05:00:05,279 --> 05:00:05,840
Yes.

2420
05:00:05,840 --> 05:00:06,080
No.

2421
05:00:07,360 --> 05:00:08,240
He genuinely...

2422
05:00:08,240 --> 05:00:09,439
I have no idea.

2423
05:00:15,130 --> 05:00:19,529
Dude, I'm half blind and every vent is the same vent.

2424
05:00:20,650 --> 05:00:23,770
And if I open this door, this guy instantly kills me.

2425
05:00:32,009 --> 05:00:33,290
No one knows.

2426
05:00:33,290 --> 05:00:39,439
Go up the elevator.

2427
05:00:39,439 --> 05:00:39,919
Go up the...

2428
05:00:40,799 --> 05:00:44,909
Well, this game is really fun until right now.

2429
05:00:45,470 --> 05:00:51,560
So climb up this shit again?

2430
05:01:10,799 --> 05:01:11,520
No, don't.

2431
05:01:11,520 --> 05:01:12,880
You're going the wrong way.

2432
05:01:14,490 --> 05:01:16,169
No, it's just the right way, right?

2433
05:01:21,979 --> 05:01:23,099
Don't go in the vent.

2434
05:01:32,860 --> 05:01:33,819
Just go up.

2435
05:01:33,819 --> 05:01:42,540
Go talk to vent Andy and give him the pack of smokes.

2436
05:01:42,540 --> 05:01:43,659
He gives you a map.

2437
05:01:44,459 --> 05:01:56,270
Go talk to vent Andy.

2438
05:01:56,990 --> 05:02:02,080
This has been such like a mess of going in circles.

2439
05:02:02,080 --> 05:02:04,080
I don't even know where that elevator...

2440
05:02:04,080 --> 05:02:06,479
That one that I jumped on that test squishing his self.

2441
05:02:06,479 --> 05:02:17,930
I don't know where it is.

2442
05:02:17,930 --> 05:02:18,169
Bring...

2443
05:02:21,639 --> 05:02:22,040
All right.

2444
05:02:22,040 --> 05:02:22,439
If it's...

2445
05:02:24,200 --> 05:02:24,520
Why?

2446
05:02:25,319 --> 05:02:37,319
I'm going to go over here and then watch the video of how to beat this.

2447
05:02:50,169 --> 05:02:53,049
Rick roll, but with a different link so people can't memorize it.

2448
05:02:53,049 --> 05:02:53,849
That's hysterical.

2449
05:02:53,849 --> 05:02:54,169
Thank you.

2450
05:03:15,759 --> 05:03:16,720
Turn around?

2451
05:03:17,360 --> 05:03:37,400
No, no, no, no, no.

2452
05:03:37,400 --> 05:03:38,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2453
05:03:38,360 --> 05:03:39,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2454
05:03:39,240 --> 05:03:40,040
Where am I?

2455
05:03:40,040 --> 05:03:44,509
Okay.

2456
05:03:44,509 --> 05:03:44,830
All right.

2457
05:03:44,830 --> 05:03:45,310
All right, all right.

2458
05:03:45,310 --> 05:03:46,110
All right, all right, all right.

2459
05:03:46,110 --> 05:03:47,150
Everybody calm down.

2460
05:03:47,150 --> 05:03:54,000
How am I going to get into this vent?

2461
05:03:54,000 --> 05:04:00,009
Go up behind you.

2462
05:04:00,009 --> 05:04:00,810
How am I going to do that?

2463
05:04:01,529 --> 05:04:05,790
Go to the right end of it.

2464
05:04:05,790 --> 05:04:36,650
Oh my God.

2465
05:04:40,380 --> 05:04:42,599
Did I do that on purpose?

2466
05:04:42,599 --> 05:04:44,119
No, I did not.

2467
05:04:44,119 --> 05:04:47,000
I was trying to get the prompt to say to climb in the vent.

2468
05:04:47,000 --> 05:04:47,720
And it wouldn't happen.

2469
05:04:47,720 --> 05:04:49,959
And I can't jump in the fucking thing.

2470
05:04:50,439 --> 05:04:51,479
Oh my God.

2471
05:04:52,680 --> 05:05:25,979
Oh, he's not going to beat the game.

2472
05:05:28,540 --> 05:05:30,360
Well, all right.

2473
05:05:30,360 --> 05:05:33,720
In a game that's about being not able to see anything,

2474
05:05:33,720 --> 05:05:35,400
don't you think you'd want everything to be pretty clear?

2475
05:05:36,119 --> 05:05:37,639
No, shit.

2476
05:05:37,639 --> 05:05:40,520
That's completely the opposite of what we're talking about.

2477
05:05:40,520 --> 05:05:41,959
In a game where you can't see anything.

2478
05:05:41,959 --> 05:05:42,680
Oh, whatever.

2479
05:05:42,680 --> 05:05:43,560
I, it doesn't matter.

2480
05:05:44,119 --> 05:05:55,040
I don't think I can even get over here.

2481
05:05:57,119 --> 05:05:58,880
I'm really not sure I can get over to this.

2482
05:05:59,439 --> 05:06:01,639
Do I have to, can I press like a button?

2483
05:06:03,240 --> 05:06:04,200
You have to jump.

2484
05:06:04,840 --> 05:06:05,639
No, I don't.

2485
05:06:05,639 --> 05:06:08,889
Please tell me you're fucking lying to me.

2486
05:06:08,889 --> 05:06:09,610
You're lying to me.

2487
05:06:09,610 --> 05:06:10,409
I can't believe it.

2488
05:06:10,409 --> 05:06:11,130
I can't do it.

2489
05:06:11,130 --> 05:06:12,009
I can't get in there.

2490
05:06:12,009 --> 05:06:13,369
I'm fucking screwed.

2491
05:06:17,209 --> 05:06:20,169
I have to go through that door where the big guy is

2492
05:06:20,169 --> 05:06:20,970
and sneak over.

2493
05:06:20,970 --> 05:06:23,290
But the guy just has a gun pointed at me.

2494
05:06:38,650 --> 05:06:39,290
You know what?

2495
05:06:39,290 --> 05:06:56,400
Just, just go.

2496
05:06:56,400 --> 05:06:56,959
Holy shit.

2497
05:06:56,959 --> 05:06:59,119
He's finally not, don't turn.

2498
05:06:59,119 --> 05:07:07,439
Don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, don't turn.

2499
05:07:07,439 --> 05:07:08,080
Yeah, that's right.

2500
05:07:09,680 --> 05:07:15,340
Come on over here.

2501
05:07:15,340 --> 05:07:15,819
Come on.

2502
05:07:15,819 --> 05:07:23,959
Why don't you come over here and say that to my face.

2503
05:07:42,250 --> 05:07:42,490
Sick.

2504
05:07:43,209 --> 05:07:45,880
Okay.

2505
05:07:45,880 --> 05:07:47,159
Good, good, good.

2506
05:07:47,159 --> 05:07:49,020
I'm going to finally get there.

2507
05:07:49,020 --> 05:07:49,900
I'm going to finally get there.

2508
05:07:49,900 --> 05:07:51,020
I'm not going to be soft locked anymore.

2509
05:08:04,700 --> 05:08:09,740
Oh, go, go, go forward.

2510
05:08:21,450 --> 05:08:21,689
Okay.

2511
05:08:21,689 --> 05:09:02,189
All right, I did it they do have indecent impression

2512
05:09:02,810 --> 05:09:14,099
Wait, no, there's this part too. Oh, no, remember this part

2513
05:09:14,099 --> 05:09:22,700
How much I hated this shit at least one of these guys has to be they're just in the same spot waiting for me

2514
05:09:38,180 --> 05:09:44,259
Damn it. He's still here. I know you've left probably for a while and I know I progressed but then I

2515
05:09:44,979 --> 05:09:54,580
Soft-locked myself then I had to come back here. Oh, this is gonna be impossible, isn't it? There's two guys just here

2516
05:09:55,020 --> 05:09:58,909
Okay, okay, okay

2517
05:09:59,349 --> 05:10:02,590
Impossible to when they're right there. I can Batman both of them

2518
05:10:03,229 --> 05:10:15,770
They just saw me instantly

2519
05:10:16,490 --> 05:10:22,729
Riddick is the easiest guy to see apparently. It's just really easy to see

2520
05:10:23,290 --> 05:10:38,860
Don't know how he didn't see that that apparently you didn't see me do that

2521
05:10:39,500 --> 05:10:41,500
Shot his own friend in the head

2522
05:10:42,020 --> 05:11:01,040
Thank God. Can you please come over here so I can just melee parry attack you?

2523
05:11:01,040 --> 05:11:07,759
I want to get out of this zone so bad. I can't run for it. He'll kill me

2524
05:11:08,279 --> 05:11:16,000
Now he's running the fuck away. Where is he? It's my opportunity

2525
05:11:17,159 --> 05:11:35,209
Go here. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Finally. Give me

2526
05:11:35,849 --> 05:11:38,270
Yes. Oh, yes. Thank God

Thank God. Yeah, there he had member this guy. This is the guy remember Mosley. Oh

2528
05:11:46,400 --> 05:12:06,819
Yes, okay, and then this cargo transport for the love of goodness

2529
05:12:07,560 --> 05:12:09,560
Okay, we have to go down now

2530
05:12:11,849 --> 05:12:14,270
Time for progress game progress game progress

2531
05:12:21,900 --> 05:12:23,099
Jump down

2532
05:12:23,099 --> 05:12:25,659
There's not a whole lot of fall damage, but I don't want to just die

2533
05:12:26,220 --> 05:12:43,720
Oh, I can jump on that bad guy a good guy

2534
05:12:47,049 --> 05:12:49,049
Dolan stay off my heart

2535
05:12:49,869 --> 05:12:52,029
What the hell happened to you?

2536
05:12:52,029 --> 05:12:53,549
Hey

2537
05:12:53,549 --> 05:12:55,950
He had a fucking train gun. All right

2538
05:12:57,450 --> 05:12:59,450
Do you want to buy the gun? Yeah

2539
05:12:59,849 --> 05:13:04,090
I will take the tranquilizer gun 30. Uh, I was just saying 30 quid

2540
05:13:05,049 --> 05:13:08,669
Here you go

2541
05:13:08,669 --> 05:13:13,549
Tranquilizer gun can be used to electroshock enemies. They will recover fairly quickly unless you neutralize them representing right trigger

2542
05:13:16,430 --> 05:13:19,229
Nice. Okay, cool. Now, what the hell does this matter?

2543
05:13:25,580 --> 05:13:27,819
Mining core finally my god

2544
05:13:28,459 --> 05:13:42,840
The air is thick smells of oil machines crushed rock

2545
05:13:43,959 --> 05:13:45,959
Something else

2546
05:13:46,680 --> 05:13:51,419
Yeah, we finally got some progress

2547
05:14:02,040 --> 05:14:09,130
There

2548
05:14:09,130 --> 05:14:17,259
He's screaming he's dead

2549
05:14:17,819 --> 05:14:27,290
Can I get a headshot from down here?

2550
05:14:30,970 --> 05:14:32,409
Oh, I can

2551
05:14:32,409 --> 05:14:37,020
Can I tranquilize the guy in the suit?

2552
05:14:37,819 --> 05:14:41,180
No, I can't

2553
05:14:41,180 --> 05:14:44,759
I can get the gun

2554
05:14:45,450 --> 05:14:47,049
No, you can't

2555
05:14:47,049 --> 05:15:01,319
Why is this guy walking over here? He's walking over here. Why why?

2556
05:15:02,040 --> 05:15:34,860
What do we do about this, dude?

2557
05:15:37,419 --> 05:15:42,680
I can't like smash the thing on his back. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn off the lights turn off the lights

2558
05:15:44,250 --> 05:15:48,409
I thought that just trying to see if I could like smash the thing on his back because it took one shot last time

2559
05:16:07,689 --> 05:16:10,169
Yeah, yep. Yeah body detected

2560
05:16:12,810 --> 05:16:14,680
Yeah

2561
05:16:14,680 --> 05:16:20,319
Yeah

2562
05:16:24,720 --> 05:16:28,159
He's actually moving get the fuck away from me, dude

2563
05:16:53,520 --> 05:17:09,770
Okay and go

2564
05:17:12,639 --> 05:17:33,049
Thank you, all right, we're good pretty good progress end to andy

2565
05:17:34,810 --> 05:17:37,439
Hey, I can't even you guys are too much

2566
05:17:38,080 --> 05:17:41,520
All right. So we got a ladder that way, but what's down here?

2567
05:17:58,520 --> 05:18:00,520
Super hard boss time

2568
05:18:00,680 --> 05:18:04,319
upper mine

2569
05:18:04,319 --> 05:18:05,580
No

2570
05:18:05,580 --> 05:18:13,400
Hold on. Did I just wait? Did I just go back up?

2571
05:18:16,810 --> 05:18:20,860
I don't want to do that. This is the air. Yeah, this is the same area from last time

2572
05:18:32,700 --> 05:18:37,099
Not using guns no this game does this fun thing that makes it so it electrocutes you if you pick one up

2573
05:18:39,159 --> 05:18:55,000
So what should I go up?

2574
05:18:55,000 --> 05:19:00,110
I was already up here

2575
05:19:00,110 --> 05:19:17,340
No, no, no, no, no, no, no the way that the big mech guy is walking is where I have to go

2576
05:19:27,450 --> 05:19:29,450
big mac

2577
05:19:30,330 --> 05:19:32,330
I didn't say that I said big mac

2578
05:19:40,110 --> 05:19:49,240
Big mac I do anything like that. He's not even looking over here

2579
05:19:57,740 --> 05:19:59,580
What was deactivated?

2580
05:19:59,580 --> 05:20:19,709
I'm gonna hide in this thing in here that my life support

2581
05:20:20,349 --> 05:20:34,590
Where is this guy going? Is this technically in the dark?

2582
05:20:36,590 --> 05:21:04,040
Okay, just stay right here don't fucking move

2583
05:21:17,720 --> 05:21:23,240
You have to be that I didn't do anything

2584
05:21:24,569 --> 05:21:26,569
I just didn't do anything

2585
05:21:27,290 --> 05:21:29,290
I stayed completely still

2586
05:21:33,520 --> 05:21:35,520
You didn't I was crouching. Yes. I was

2587
05:21:40,560 --> 05:21:42,560
What was that explosion?

2588
05:21:54,080 --> 05:21:56,080
What what did I touch?

2589
05:22:01,389 --> 05:22:06,959
It's there was a valve so I pressed the

2590
05:22:09,229 --> 05:22:11,229
Why is everything an explosion?

2591
05:22:12,639 --> 05:22:22,110
That doesn't make any sense

2592
05:22:22,189 --> 05:22:24,349
Is there a tripwire that i'm crossing?

2593
05:22:44,200 --> 05:22:47,319
Valve what the fuck I don't get it

2594
05:23:01,529 --> 05:23:03,290
Why is that there?

2595
05:23:03,290 --> 05:23:05,290
What is it there for?

2596
05:23:08,169 --> 05:23:10,169
You're still alive

2597
05:23:11,159 --> 05:23:13,159
That's just impossible

2598
05:23:14,009 --> 05:23:16,009
All right, i'm fucking out of here

2599
05:23:16,569 --> 05:23:18,569
Oh, no, i'm not

2600
05:23:54,970 --> 05:23:57,290
Okay, okay, I wasn't even close

2601
05:23:59,639 --> 05:24:01,400
Okay

2602
05:24:01,400 --> 05:24:05,889
Um, I can't open I can't do anything with the panel. I don't have a screwdriver

2603
05:24:07,340 --> 05:24:08,459
watch

2604
05:24:08,459 --> 05:24:12,540
Look look look everyone's screaming at me to open the panel. It doesn't do anything

2605
05:24:13,599 --> 05:24:16,319
Shoot the lights with a tranquilizer gun. It's not gonna do anything

2606
05:24:17,599 --> 05:24:19,840
Why is it electricity turn the lights off?

2607
05:24:22,439 --> 05:24:24,360
Okay, watch

2608
05:24:24,360 --> 05:24:26,880
See

2609
05:24:26,880 --> 05:24:30,159
It doesn't do anything. It just turns off the real defense and I got lied to again. It's okay

2610
05:24:37,200 --> 05:24:49,709
No, I want to deactivate it. Can I climb that?

2611
05:24:50,349 --> 05:25:01,360
Wait a minute. Wait explode them explode them. Good idea

2612
05:25:02,299 --> 05:25:11,709
Great idea got it. He's alive

2613
05:25:35,450 --> 05:25:39,290
Okay, i'm gonna do it. I blew them both up. I thought

2614
05:25:40,169 --> 05:25:42,330
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right

2615
05:25:42,650 --> 05:25:45,209
All right, right, right, right

2616
05:25:45,209 --> 05:25:51,290
Listen listen, I know I tried to blow them up because I thought the explosion was gonna fucking kill

2617
05:25:52,169 --> 05:25:59,049
I figured that an explosion was going to kill people. It doesn't kill anybody but me i'm the only one it targets

2618
05:25:59,849 --> 05:26:04,169
Even if that guy's standing next to it doesn't do anything. Shut up. I'm talking to people leave me

2619
05:26:05,369 --> 05:26:39,959
Shoot the lights who cares? Let's go. Who's body?

2620
05:26:40,599 --> 05:26:43,159
Wait, who the fuck is this?

2621
05:26:43,479 --> 05:26:45,479
Get off of me. Uh, what?

2622
05:27:05,979 --> 05:27:07,659
I'm gonna take a look

2623
05:27:07,659 --> 05:27:24,970
nothing here

2624
05:27:24,970 --> 05:27:30,599
Where that's really awkward how they just kind of dump you and put it where like where the hell am I?

2625
05:27:31,159 --> 05:27:43,360
Do I have to go up there?

2626
05:27:43,360 --> 05:27:48,439
Okay. Wait, should I blow it up? I can blow it up. I can blow it up. I can blow it up. I should do it

2627
05:27:49,080 --> 05:27:56,189
Not yet. Where's the big guy?

2628
05:27:56,590 --> 05:27:58,810
Where's the huge guy?

2629
05:27:58,810 --> 05:28:18,619
Where's the huge guy?

2630
05:28:18,619 --> 05:28:21,979
I'm sorry. This is like top 10 ugliest games i've ever played

2631
05:28:22,959 --> 05:28:24,560
I'm sorry

2632
05:28:24,560 --> 05:28:50,409
Hey, do you see that thing in front of you? I'm gonna take a look i'm gonna climb this shit

2633
05:29:00,569 --> 05:29:14,970
I'm not no don't tell me to go touch the valve. I'm not touching the valve. I can't climb this. All right

2634
05:29:15,049 --> 05:29:35,130
I'm just gonna go i'm good. I'm good friend of foe friend or foe friend or foe

2635
05:29:37,290 --> 05:29:45,000

2636
05:29:45,000 --> 05:30:05,389

You don't want to get what I can give jagger. Is that paper?

2641
05:30:31,529 --> 05:30:37,259
I suspect you're right. I did this to him

2642
05:30:38,060 --> 05:30:42,939
There's a sealed off area at the end of this corridor inside is a package that I need

2643
05:30:43,819 --> 05:30:46,000
But the area is filled with gas

2644
05:30:47,200 --> 05:30:52,299
Hmm

2678
05:38:58,500 --> 05:39:01,500
Where are you?

2679
05:39:01,500 --> 05:39:05,580
Hey, all right. Now give me the security code. You are as advertised ridic

2680
05:39:06,689 --> 05:39:09,330
Did you notice anything about the spot where you found the package?

2681
05:39:10,290 --> 05:39:13,650
That small cave is actually right above the home of a breed of creatures

2682
05:39:14,610 --> 05:39:16,610
Large and vicious ones

2683
05:39:17,169 --> 05:39:21,979
There'd be chaos if something were to open up a hole. I'm probably gonna call it here. I'll need a bomb

2684
05:39:25,060 --> 05:39:26,900
If you take me with you

2685
05:39:26,900 --> 05:39:29,840
No, nothing slows me down

2686
05:39:31,439 --> 05:39:33,439
Score ridic

2687
05:39:35,169 --> 05:39:38,930
See, I kind of want to play this zone. He's connected and can get you a bomb

2688
05:39:42,479 --> 05:39:48,080
Here's my good faith. I don't know why I want to keep playing codes. You'll need to reach him. I'll meet you at the space port

2689
05:39:48,799 --> 05:39:51,490
All right, you got it

2690
05:39:51,569 --> 05:39:54,959
Is there no fast way to get the hell out of here?

2691
05:39:55,439 --> 05:40:01,840
Get to tower 19 and get a bomb

2692
05:40:01,919 --> 05:40:07,360
Get to tower 19 head back from the mining core to the mine entrance then use the code to activate the elevator and go back

2693
05:40:07,360 --> 05:40:08,880
Up to the work pass

2694
05:40:08,880 --> 05:40:11,060
Oh, I have to go all the way back

2695
05:40:14,259 --> 05:40:20,290
Yeah, all right. So here's what's gonna happen. You're so close to finishing one hour max. Wait, is that for real?

2696
05:40:23,099 --> 05:40:24,939
In fact, no, that's not accurate

2697
05:40:24,939 --> 05:40:34,000
Is it true?

2698
05:40:34,000 --> 05:40:36,240
Like maybe 45 minutes 20 minutes

2699
05:40:37,459 --> 05:40:39,939
Is it actually true? Am I getting one guy because i'll just finish it now

2700
05:40:45,939 --> 05:40:51,220
You may be like halfway through. Okay. I'm not gonna lay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, uh, we'll do this tomorrow

2701
05:40:52,020 --> 05:40:54,020
I'm good to go for three days in a row. I think

2702
05:40:54,180 --> 05:41:00,990
I'll be good for three days in a row. We'll do this again tomorrow

2703
05:41:04,290 --> 05:41:06,529
I I think this game is actually pretty fun

2704
05:41:07,490 --> 05:41:08,290
as

2705
05:41:08,290 --> 05:41:10,290
the juke as

2706
05:41:10,290 --> 05:41:11,490
goofy

2707
05:41:11,490 --> 05:41:14,689
That's why can I not say the word goofy?

2708
05:41:15,330 --> 05:41:24,880
What about saw? Uh saw two is gonna be played

2709
05:41:28,319 --> 05:41:30,619
But yeah, we'll do three days in a row

2710
05:41:30,619 --> 05:41:34,380
Well, if I beat this within like a couple of hours tomorrow, then we'll just i'll do something else for the time being

2711
05:41:34,939 --> 05:41:46,860
According to how long to beat you've got about two hours left. All right. Well, we'll we'll just do this tomorrow finish it up and

2712
05:41:47,580 --> 05:41:49,580
Maybe we'll do something else and just chill for like an hour or two

2713
05:41:50,459 --> 05:41:54,450
but for now

2714
05:41:54,450 --> 05:41:56,610
That's gonna be it

2715
05:41:56,610 --> 05:42:04,209
It's stupid. I gotta figure out I gotta tape this shit back. You won't beat this tomorrow dark athena. Oh, that's right

2716
05:42:05,500 --> 05:42:07,979
Well, let's at least get to the end of butcher's bay

2717
05:42:10,080 --> 05:42:13,599
Salt on dark athena sucks. Well, we don't have to play it

2718
05:42:14,240 --> 05:42:19,040
But yeah, i'll see you guys tomorrow

2719
05:42:19,040 --> 05:42:21,279
We'll finish this up. We'll maybe do something else

2720
05:42:21,919 --> 05:42:27,009
I'll see you soon

2721
05:42:27,009 --> 05:42:30,849
Hey, look if i'm still failing it tomorrow if I get to the end of butcher's bay tomorrow and it's like yeah

2722
05:42:31,490 --> 05:42:33,090
Maybe i'll just keep going

2723
05:42:33,090 --> 05:42:39,569
But that is the end of today

It's nothing to do with reddit. My fucking chest hurts from laughing at this shit

2754
05:45:12,400 --> 05:45:17,200
