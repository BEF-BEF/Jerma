00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,439
Hey, welcome back ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hitman Absolution.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,390
Currently evading a helicopter right now. So, uh, hi welcome to the show and welcome. Let's go. Just helicopter BEE!

3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,940
How can this thing see me? Oh my word!

4
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,560
This thing is just lighting up the room.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,210
Just stop like just jumping around. Just go, go man.

6
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,729
Go, just sprint. It's over, go.

7
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,909
I'm getting taken hits here.

8
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,820
Get me the hell.

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:02,820
I didn't do that. That was not the animation I was doing. Is there still a guard up here?

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:19,189
I thought I was done. There's more. All right, this guy's right here. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:29,620
Damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:47,980
Where's the copper? The chopper? The chopper? Where's the chopper? Go, go hide from the helicopter.

13
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,609
Two cops, three cops over there, it looks like.

14
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,250
Damn, man, how on earth do you expect me to get by?

15
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:12,900
Go! Where's the helicopter? No, it's coming back, coming back.

16
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,039
Ex-military.

17
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,949
Can't go anywhere right now.

18
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:42,069
Hello, where you going? Where's your route? You don't have a route. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Both have a route.

19
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:53,139
Oh, get out of here, man. No, I'm gonna have to go back this way.

20
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:59,740
No, I'm not. Perfect. Copper, get out. Get out of here, chopper. You're blowing my moves. Get out of here.

21
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:10,979
Good. The back, it looks like, maybe. What about that guy's all the way down there?

22
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,129
I should have made a move.

23
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:31,509
Should have made my move. Should have made my freaking move. It's time to make my move. Here we go.

24
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,710
Let's go. Make the move, make the move, make the move, make the move.

25
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:45,810
The helicopter can see me. This guy's gonna make his way back this way, and then I'm home free. That's the door right there.

26
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,500
Wait until the car, the chopper is... Oh, shoot.

27
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,180
Get out of my way.

28
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:06,960
Damn it. You prick. If I still had that hammer, I would have thrown it by now.

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,979
I'm going for a run. Right when this guy goes back the other way, I'm going for a run.

30
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm just running the other way into the, I'm just gonna run.

31
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,529
Here we go. In three, two,

32
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,569
one.

33
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:36,420
It's action time. Oh, it's action time. Yes. There's more. There's more. Oh, there's even more.

34
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:49,779
Can I just walk through here? Yeah, these guys, these guys, I'm a police officer to these guys. They have no idea.

35
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,509
Get out of my way.

36
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,829
Wow. No, those are cops. Those are cops. Those are cops. Those are cops.

37
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:05,670
Evade the police? This guy's like flushing. What? This guy's flooding the bathroom. Dear Lord, give me the knife.

38
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:20,079
Thank you very much. I'll take that. It's the police. I can't remain undetected for long. The elevator is my exit point.

39
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,269
All right, let's go.

40
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:32,930
Keep low and keep quiet. This is ridiculous. I'm in like plants. I'm in like marijuana leaves.

41
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,870
Shit.

42
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,310
These guys are getting arrested over there.

43
00:05:48,949 --> 00:06:00,500
Don't do drugs. Once this guy moves. I got a chance. There we go. Let's keep moving.

44
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,560
Let's keep moving. That's a bad place to be.

45
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,290
Where am I?

46
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,009
No, sit down. Sit down. What are you doing? What am I doing?

47
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:26,959
What'd I stand up for? My guy is like stood up. Hey, it worked. All right, whatever. That's good. Okay.

48
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,970
Fields of joy.

49
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,129
Activate checkpoint. I absolutely will.

50
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,689
Activate checkpoint. Hell freaking yeah. All right. Can I go out the window?

51
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:46,970
I don't think so. Anything in here. Point of interest. Anything I can do. This is gonna cause a fire, bro.

52
00:06:47,329 --> 00:07:02,290
Two cops in here. They are currently busy. It seems like. No. I might have to try a different route.

53
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:08,899
I might have to try a different route. Or I could be able to sneak by them, but I have to walk right by them.

54
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:15,430
I don't know if that's gonna work. No, I don't think it is.

55
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,470
Holy crap.

56
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,920
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna walk by these two. I'm gonna try and just be like I'm an officer.

57
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,529
See you later. Here we go.

58
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,620
Maybe not.

59
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,980
Anything else? Anything else?

60
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:49,290
Nope. I'm just gonna keep following these guys. I'm gonna follow these cops. They're making their way out.

61
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,160
Hopefully those beads don't make a whole lot of noise.

62
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:05,660
There is my exit point. Get me the hell out of here. Oh, I should be careful.

63
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,980
This is a bad idea just walking straight over here, but you know what? I don't really have another option.

64
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,810
Oh, this room is full of people.

65
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,610
Distraction.

66
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:31,370
In this room. Oh crap.

67
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:45,059
I don't want to kill this guy. No, it's not somebody you know. Just go back to your business.

68
00:08:48,919 --> 00:09:00,860
What's what distraction do I need? I really don't want to like push. I'm gonna have to like drown this dude, aren't I?

69
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:14,929
Oh boy. Wait, why did he die from that? What the hell is this stuff? Is this like acid?

70
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:23,970
Why did he just die from that? Whatever. Not that way.

71
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:35,289
What kind of weirdo has like all these messed up bathtubs? Prices. Half hour $15, regular $20. Mud bath.

72
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:41,940
Hey, I don't want to alarm you or anything dude, but your mud bath kills people instantly when they touch it.

73
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,779
Just wanted to throw that out there for you. In case you weren't aware. There's a point of interest back here.

74
00:09:48,860 --> 00:10:02,549
Put the knife away. Here's a bottle. I will absolutely take the bottle. Gonna have to throw that. Guaranteed.

75
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:09,100
This situation requires a distraction. Damn it.

76
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,889
Hmm.

77
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:27,629
This son of a bitch just hanging out in there. I got to get rid of that guy. These guys aren't paying that much attention.

78
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:34,159
Probably just sneak behind him. Evidence. Give me the evidence.

79
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,659
Maybe not. Maybe not, guys. I think I might have to just... No, no. What are you doing?

80
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:55,220
Alright, that's fine. You're good. Who is this guy in this room? This guy just might... I'm just freaking me out.

81
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:06,970
Damn it. I have an idea. This is... this is crazy, and I'm probably going to...

82
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,639
Probably going to regret doing this, but this is really the only thing I can think of, and we're going to try it right now. Here we go.

83
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:29,860
Okay. That should have distracted at least one of these guys. Let me in this room. Let me in this room. Let me in this room.

84
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:40,639
Point of interest in here. Anything? There is a... a bong.

85
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:49,840
Alright. Insert tape into the tape recorder. This will surely compromise with my position. Okay. I know what I got to do.

86
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:58,179
I know what I got to do. I've got to put a tape in here, and then see where the hell they come from.

87
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:06,070
Nice dance music. Here they come. Here they come. They're all coming in from this way.

88
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:16,519
Oh boy, I just... I just screwed myself over right here. I just completely screwed myself right here.

89
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:25,570
This... this asshole would get out of the freaking way over here. I want to just throw a knife at this guy's head.

90
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:36,259
I'm like holding a bong. It's time to go. It's time to just walk straight out. Get out of the way.

91
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:41,259
Oh, get out of the way, you piece of crap. Move out of the way! Move out of the way!

92
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,899
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

93
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:58,320
Get in the elevator. Get in the elevator. Oh crap. That's bad. That's real bad. That's real bad. That's real bad.

94
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh, can I go this way? Come on. I got to find a hiding place right now. Right now.

95
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,360
Oh, get me in the tub. Get me one of the damn tubs. I need to get in like in a tub.

96
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:22,519
I can hide in there. Let me hide in this tub. The one that I killed the dude, and I don't care.

97
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:30,620
I'll hide in the tub. You think it bothers me? What's going on with that guy?

98
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:48,230
Is that guy dead? Man. Damn it. Give me the screwdriver. Now I need a new disguise. This is bad.

99
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:56,220
If that guy wasn't just in the goddamn way, this would have been over by now. Piece of crap.

100
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,539
Good. Maybe you'll come hunting for me, and I'll be able to just sneak around. Son of a bitch.

101
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:20,789
Wow. Get me out of this room. There should be nobody at this door now. Oh, thank heavens. Thank heavens.

102
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:29,019
What? You gotta be kidding me. Oh, no. Oh, you know what? I'm so sick and tired of this.

103
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:38,679
Get out of my face. No ammo? That was the end right there. You gotta be kidding me.

104
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:43,639
Oh, I'm so pissed off right now. Oh. Alright, I made it back here.

105
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:50,970
I got minus 1,400 though on the way somehow. I don't know how the hell that happened.

106
00:14:53,159 --> 00:15:02,200
So I'm gonna make sure I kill this guy. I am going to murder the guy that's in this room right now.

107
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,519
Do I have a horrible way for him to die? Whoa, speaking of dying, there's a guy coming my way

108
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,769
right now. And a guy coming the other way, I think. Damn. Just walk right by me, dude.

109
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:19,500
Don't worry about a thing. Just keep going. You don't see anything. Go. Alright. I'm gonna

110
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:26,179
think of the worst way to kill this guy because he ruined my good game over here. Alright, I'm going

111
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:35,610
in. Alright, where is this guy? Hey, you know what? You are dead. I don't even care. This guy

112
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:43,690
ruined everything. Get over here. I don't care if I get minus 50 million points. You ruined

113
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,570
everything, you son of a bitch. I should just shoot you in the face too. Alright, let's keep

114
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:54,039
going. Now I'm gonna play the music and the cops are gonna come out. I had a really good score

115
00:15:54,039 --> 00:16:00,019
going too, I think. Let's go. Come on in, boys. Let me finish this.

116
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:19,590
I'm sure they're coming in. Only two? Where's the other ones? Alright. Now start arguing.

117
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:30,600
Let's go. That's all it took. I just had to, like, kill the dude. Here we go. Call the elevator.

118
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:38,580
Beautiful. And that's gonna wrap up the video, guys. The episode. Thank you all so much for

119
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,899
watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys in the next episode trying to evade the

120
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:49,299
police even more. And let me know in the comment section, guys, if you want to see this series

121
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:56,019
continue in its current form or if you would rather see something like crazy mission parts or juicy

122
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,940
rage moments or something like that. Funny little highlight clips of this game because I'm willing

123
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,059
to do both. But just let me know. I might do both. I might try a change a little bit up a little bit

124
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,579
here in the next couple episodes. We will see. But thank you so much for watching. I really do

125
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,940
appreciate it again, guys. And I'll see y'all soon. Take care, everybody.
