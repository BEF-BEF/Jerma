1
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,700
Anybody notice the name of the stream and the game of the stream?

2
00:00:53,189 --> 00:01:15,140
Nose pimple? Let me turn this up. Nose pimple? Where? I don't see a nose pimple. What are we talking about?

3
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:30,840
No, we're good. Turn to the side. I got nothing there. You guys are lying.

4
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:40,519
All right, let's play Rain World for a little bit. By the way, I'm going into this

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,079
upset. Let's see if it makes me happy. I'm going to this upset. Let's see if it like,

6
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,120
if you guys were right. And I am not going to hold back any criticisms of this game.

7
00:01:55,129 --> 00:02:06,700
I'm going to criticize it if I don't like it because it was your choice. Five of you. Is this

8
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:29,560
a controller game or what? Controller? Yep. Look at him. Fucking hell. All right, here you think?

9
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,319
I'm not lying to you. I'm not lying. It's actually opening. It's opening right now.

10
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:41,240
I swear to God, people think I'm making it up that, oh, he's just, no, he didn't. Yeah, I did.

11
00:02:49,349 --> 00:03:27,849
Uh, hold on. All right, here it comes. I have an Xbox controller. Don't swim. Actual Rain World.

12
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:52,219
We played him like a fiddle. I want to know. Rain World. The monk. Weak of body but strong of

13
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,900
spirit, in tune with the mysteries of the world and empathetic to its creatures, your journey will

14
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:04,199
be a significantly more peaceful one. The survivor. A nimble omnivore, both predator and prey,

15
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:08,599
lost in a harsh and indifferent land, you must make your way your own way with wit and caution as

16
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:16,569
your greatest asset. The hunter. Strong and quick with a fierce metabolism requiring a steady diet

17
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:22,250
of meat. The stomach won't be your only concern as the path of the hunter is one of extreme peril.

18
00:04:35,259 --> 00:05:13,980
Meat and plants. That sounds good. And this is where we fall to F4.

19
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:21,829
Don't ever tell me to fucking play a game. Don't ever force me to quit a game ever again.

20
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:14,379
Ah, the clap. Wait, so what happened? Oh no, I'm falling. How does this game play?

21
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:29,670
Was there an actual wink? There was. Yeah, there was. Move this down. Just keep it on.

22
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:46,300
All right, we have a map. Eat, throw, and jump. Eat, pick up, and eat. This is the map. Okay.

23
00:06:46,300 --> 00:07:03,100
This is pause. All right. And there's also a throw. Okay. Any climb? Can I climb up on stuff?

24
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:16,569
You are hungry, find food. What do I eat? Play Elderborn or I am leaving. You bastard.

25
00:07:21,079 --> 00:08:02,420
Can I eat that? What is it doing? It's just following me around. I can't eat it. I can't

26
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:29,110
eat that. Oh, this is the tutorial. I'm trying to eat the tutorial friend. Catch and eat them.

27
00:08:29,110 --> 00:09:08,220
Oh, eat it. And it's X to eat. Okay. Eat. Four is enough to hibernate. Hibernate. How do you

28
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:31,899
hibernate? My character's pretty cute. Do you evolve or something? Jump and grab them. They're

29
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:40,309
delicious. I thought I said I was already full. Additional food above four is kept for later.

30
00:09:41,029 --> 00:10:02,120
Kept for later. Okay. You are full. I can't eat any more food. I can't hear anything.

31
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:25,460
I'll fix that. Okay. Let's go. Elderborn waiting room. Nope. This is what you're getting.

32
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:57,110
Leap the gap. That didn't work. This game is terrifying. And then hold A. Okay. Down,

33
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:16,620
down A. What the fuck are you trying to tell me to do? Okay. Briefly tap down to crouch.

34
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,779
That's what I just did. When crouching, hold the jump button without giving other input.

35
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:32,549
And then let it go and move in a direction. Okay. That was not very clear. Rain is coming.

36
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:51,210
Find shelter. Does this count as shelter? Run. What do you mean run? This place is safe. Stay

37
00:11:51,210 --> 00:12:14,710
here to hibernate. Continue? Should I go? I evolve. I think I'm a new creature.

38
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:33,909
Go explore. There is food and shelter to be found, but beware of predators.

39
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:42,149
All right. Oh my God. This is a big map. All right. So I'm going to go up, up this way.

40
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,809
Game's kind of rad. We'll see. We'll see. Objects can be picked up, carried, and tossed.

41
00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:03,429
Wow. Why would I want to do this though? What am I throwing it at?

42
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:18,309
I mean, that's definitely to fight off shit. All right. Let's eat all this food. Eat the food.

43
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:42,419
I can't eat two at the same time. Why not? Okay. Two more. What happens if I'm out in the rain?

44
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,820
Will I get, you die? Is that like the death scenario? All right. Well, I've eaten.

45
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:24,440
I can make that. Maybe I can't. I can just climb it. Well, there's nothing even over here.

46
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:46,330
Oops. What? Oh, I didn't know you could do that. Okay. Okay. Well, now you know.

47
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:07,190
That really do very much. Uh, I guess I could go that way. I climb up. Let's go over here.

48
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:15,450
When we sit with any smilers, what is that? What do you mean? Any smilers?

49
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:43,370
I need a stick to throw over there. Enable smile on BTTV. Should I?

50
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:56,899
All right. I can't get in here yet. I go from here up. I think I need to throw a stick over there.

51
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:13,429
What about down here? Oh, I got it. This is a stick right here. All right. Climb this.

52
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:29,929
What's in my hand? It's a rock. Okay. Can't find this. There we go. All right. And then

53
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:53,100
can I climb from here? I guess I'm just going to go this way. There was some life support.

54
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:00,470
I'm trying to like go up there. I mean, I know this exists. I was trying to see if I could do

55
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:37,349
this first. Can I kill it? Here is a strange energy. All right. Hold on. I'm going way too far.

56
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:54,660
I'm going way too fast. I eat this thing. Eat the weird flower. All right. Pick up the rock.

57
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:16,500
In case that lizard comes back and I'll throw it right in his head. Okay. I should leave.

58
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:30,630
This is probably a bad idea. Whoa. Am I prey? Am I prey to this guy? I might be prey. All right.

59
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm going to say, what do the blue circles mean? Does that mean like, hey, go here. You got to go

60
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:48,569
here. I'm going to go right. You're prey to everything. All right. Where am I now? Maybe

61
00:18:48,569 --> 00:19:13,259
I should go up. Should I go from here? I'm going to go up, I guess. And then I got a stick.

62
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:33,099
I'm bringing a stick over here. Courage the cowardly dog. OST. Why does it have to be an OST?

63
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:50,819
All right. So now I have a stick. Now let up. I go up here. Okay. And then again,

64
00:19:51,539 --> 00:20:22,740
this is a shelter. I don't understand what this is doing.

65
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:46,940
Is it a wink? No, this doesn't. Hold on. My eyes are getting flooded. Okay. I need to eat more

66
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,180
food. I'm going to go down. I'm going to go to the left. Down and left. Still have my stick? I do.

67
00:20:55,349 --> 00:21:07,000
It's crying. What do you want? Oh, it's saying food, food down here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:21,940
There's food over here. I'm going to keep going left. Can I eat those? Can I eat the plants?

69
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:53,779
Can I eat these? Can I like tear something off and eat it? Who wins? Can I come in there

70
00:21:54,099 --> 00:22:20,009
clean up and eat it? No, they're still alive. I don't think I can. I guess I'm going to go over here.

71
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:32,920
Food that way. Can I go up? All right. I'm going to sneak around here. Why am I going this way?

72
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:58,630
This seems like a really bad idea. Food. I don't think it should be doing this.

73
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:17,880
They're going to come back and kill me or something. Oh, he's dead. All right. Now throw

74
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:42,500
this spear in the back of his head. All right. I'm going to get scraps. Bring him back to my cave.

75
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:53,990
This is food for a week. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh. Do you know I'm here?

76
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:14,039
Eat this. Why can I eat it? Eat it. Eat it. Eat it. Why won't he eat it? Why won't he eat it?

77
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:51,319
I was thinking maybe that would work. What is this in here?

78
00:24:52,630 --> 00:25:08,619
Gee. All right. Give me, give me a bat. I need to eat something.

79
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:46,019
Uh, I don't think it should be able to open like this. Oh my God.

80
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:56,250
Eat that plant. Eat this plant. Quick. Eat it. All right. Eat. Why can I eat this? Eat.

81
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:10,150
It's X, right? Eat. How do I eat this plant? It's not food. Everything is food in the goddamn wild.

82
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:35,210
Come here. Oh, fuck. I think I just. Oh, okay.

83
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:53,220
Are you stupid? Oh my God. They're finding me. In that hole.

84
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:32,230
Wait. Oh, the rain's coming. What's a shelter look like? What's a shelter look like? I don't,

85
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:44,180
I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know what a shelter looks like on the

86
00:27:44,180 --> 00:28:49,140
minimap. Am I safe in here? Oh my God. Holy shit. Where do I go? But that's it. That's it. No,

87
00:28:49,140 --> 00:29:02,490
it's not. I'm right here. Okay. What is, what is it? What does it actually look like? That sphere.

88
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:14,220
Hold on. But they have, they, they have that like a circle. It's a square. Okay. This is pretty cool

89
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:23,750
actually. So let me remember where this is. So right there is, so we're going to go right this time.

90
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:29,930
We'll go down to the left. That was right again. I don't love it. I think it was all,

91
00:29:29,930 --> 00:30:04,599
I think it's all right. What? I'm going to go right. All right. Any food? Will you leave me

92
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:17,480
alone, dude? All right. So left and then up. So up here is a shelter. You got to remember that.

93
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:30,940
Holy shit. Oh, fuck. But I've just, we just went by each other. We just called each other at the

94
00:30:30,940 --> 00:31:10,259
same time. There's still a way to go over this way. Can I get in? Like once we're here? Wait,

95
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:24,809
bats. Eat. Eat a bat. All right. Good. All right. Better than last time. I'm, I got,

96
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:36,660
I got a full stomach. I'm going to go underneath. Now I'm going to go Harbinate, but I want,

97
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,440
I want more food. I want even more food than this. I know I got like a bad nerd neck and I don't,

98
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:52,410
trust me. I'm aware of it. All right. Now we're good. Now we go back to, is that spikes?

99
00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:05,829
All right. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Wait, there's a shelter right here.

100
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:42,099
It was saying shelter, shelter right here. Shelter. I can't reach that. Come on. I can't.

101
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:58,500
Am I down? Where am I? We're both in the same tunnel. Get out of my way. All right. I'm fucking

102
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,380
at it. I'm just going. Just go, go, go. Just get out. Get the fuck out of here. Get out.

103
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:07,589
Just go. Get me out. Give me the fuck out. Give me the fuck out. I'm just going to the other

104
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:15,960
shelter I was in before. Give me the fuck out. What is that? Why is there so much shit over here?

105
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:59,220
Okay. Let's go left. Left again. And then there's a shelter right in here. Right. It's right.

106
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:12,139
Left and then up. Okay. Cool. Oh, right. My stream title is still that. Only streaming

107
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:31,940
for 20 minutes. Oh man. It really does say that. Whatever. All right. Let's hibernate.

108
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:44,889
This is my house. Get out of here. You can't come up here Kenny.

109
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,590
All right. So now we level up again. What is this? I thought you were going to play Wayne's World.

110
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:08,710
I tried to play another game and I got annoyed by it. Everyone was jumping on.

111
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,150
Five people told me to play this and I was like, all right, this game's kind of cool. And then,

112
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,260
uh, and then you can't hear me right. Cause I don't know why this game is so loud.

113
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:27,619
Why is it so loud and then so quiet? All right. Let's keep going. Where do I go from here?

114
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:44,780
Anywhere, right? It doesn't matter. Do I keep going right? I feel like there's something over

115
00:35:44,780 --> 00:36:01,880
there, but there's food down here. Get over here. Did I get it? Nice. Eat it. This is a pack of

116
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:26,360
cigarettes. What the fuck is that? What? Holy shit. There's a lot of food over here. We're going to

117
00:36:26,360 --> 00:37:11,380
get back over here this way. You are also food. Oh, exhibit a cycle three outskirts cycle three.

118
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:31,750
You are also food. Yes, I am. Let's go eat it. Fill up. You don't want to, you don't want to bat.

119
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:46,019
Let's fill up. And then we're going right back to fucking bed again. Eat it. Watch out for that

120
00:37:46,019 --> 00:38:04,360
weird lizard snake thing. Don't wake him up. This is like, I feel like I'm playing Oddworld.

121
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:25,699
All right. Back to bed. All right. Where's the shelter? It's down. I guess I go back up and

122
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:34,489
I could go all the way down. No, just, you know, down into the left. That's like a far away though.

123
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:42,579
Let's go right and then up or avoid eating enough food. All right. Let's just, let's just go back.

124
00:38:43,219 --> 00:39:02,309
No, let's go down, down, down, down, down, down. I stayed a little, I've been up here for a long time.

125
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:19,909
Let's go down again. Yeah, we're going to go down and then when I come out, I'm going to go right

126
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:47,320
and then down. I'm fully fed. All right. Let's go sleep. Close my door. Close the window. Wait,

127
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:25,500
what? Evolve? Okay. So I'm going to go all the way right. There's no evolving. Slug cat is a

128
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:35,769
perfect being. All right. Where do I want to go? I want to go down this way. So we're going to go

129
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:44,739
up, right, and then down. Why is this bigger? Wait, what are you doing? Why is he showing me

130
00:40:44,739 --> 00:41:02,250
like a movie? He's still going. Yeah. I said today was going to be longer. Can I go down from here?

131
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:40,440
I guess I can't go down. What does this take me if I go up? Can't go down. Shit. Okay. I'll keep

132
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:49,059
going right. I got, I got stuffed last time. Right. And then right again. And then Ray,

133
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:59,420
I was going to go right, right until I can't go right anymore. But don't get killed by. Oh,

134
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:20,019
fuck. Just run away. Why are there two of them now? The game is really quiet. Yeah. It's unfortunate

135
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:38,059
because the game is really quiet. And then when I get bit, it goes to 5 million decibels. Okay.

136
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:41,340
This is where I ended up last time. And I freaked out because there was, there was like a giant

137
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:53,639
mosquito over here last time. Yeah. We're going to go right. And then up. So here we go.

138
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:03,800
And I eventually eat the giant mosquito. I got to go where he is. He doesn't know where I am,

139
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:16,789
right? Like, how do I get in there? Actually anything we'll do in here. Um, I have a stick.

140
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:37,239
I got to get this stick to stick on there. And I, I'm going to kill him. I'm going to throw this.

141
00:43:37,239 --> 00:44:03,670
Should I throw it at him? Can I get this to stick right here? If I jump? No, I want to try to get it.

142
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:14,230
I'm not going to happen. Cause I can't like get up here. Wait, how did you do that? Wait, how do you

143
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:40,150
do that? Hey, thanks for the tip. And let's get in here. Okay. This is new. Now this is how you get

144
00:44:40,150 --> 00:45:10,309
up here. And then I'm going to go up. Can't grab this. No. Wait, can I go in here? Oh, all right.

145
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:26,570
This goes all the way up. Um, get in there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:37,530
I'm going to do. Is there even a way to go? No, this is like the top of the world. There's nothing

147
00:45:37,530 --> 00:46:02,019
even over here. Like there's nothing in here, right? No, there's nothing here. No, I can't do

148
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:19,269
anything about this. I got to go. Like let's go right now. Okay. Go, go with that. Uh, I need to

149
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:24,409
find the shelter for the rain now. I haven't even eaten. I haven't even fucking eaten anything.

150
00:46:25,690 --> 00:47:15,000
Fucking animals are in here. Wait, wait. I should eat one. Is there any? I gotta, I gotta go. I gotta

151
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:28,460
go. Nice. Oh, I made it back. I made it back to where I. All right, cool. Let's go. I need to eat

152
00:47:28,460 --> 00:48:28,820
something though. Right now. I mean, you little shit. Get over here. Eat. Oh, okay. Now I actually

153
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:36,059
have to eat a ton of stuff. So this is what is the final point where before I go in the way,

154
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:46,980
the survivor, right? I got to go to thought I was in uncharted territory, but apparently not.

155
00:48:47,860 --> 00:49:03,449
Where do I go? All the way left, all the way down. I'm going to say left. I need to eat food

156
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:12,730
all the way there though. Before it's a disaster. Nothing. No bugs or anything I can eat. All right.

157
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,190
Left. Uh, okay. I haven't been all the way down. All right. We're going to just go left all the

158
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:35,449
way left, left, left, left, left, left. Bottom left. Get away from me. Get away from me. Get away

159
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:55,849
from me. What? Okay. That just stunned him. All right. Move. Is he going up or down or around?

160
00:49:55,849 --> 00:50:15,400
He's going. What's he doing? Oh fuck. I'm going to do that too. Hello. What? What do I have in my

161
00:50:15,400 --> 00:52:03,610
hand? Give me another kid. Where the fuck am I? Where am I? Oh, can I die? Okay. In the vent.

162
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:09,670
Can that thing kill me in a vent? I feel like it could have. That's why I was freaking out.

163
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:27,179
Yes. Yes, it can. Okay. Yeah. Of course it can. All right. Same deal. That's a cool move. Let's go.

164
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:51,079
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I went two screens. I eat those weird mushrooms.

165
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:58,789
All right. Where am I? Something over there on the left. What's, what's this? Is it food over here?

166
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:25,320
I eat this. Wait, what? What's, what's the food that's right here? Bones or something. I don't

167
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:34,420
understand. What is here? Uh, what's, what's the, what does the bones mean?

168
00:53:35,059 --> 00:54:23,050
Is food on the floor? I don't see anything. You died here. Oh, okay. Wait, that's in here.

169
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:35,860
Double bat snack. Nice. Okay. I just need one more. Uh, this, I don't know what this G thing is. Let's go

170
00:54:36,739 --> 00:55:38,699
all the way up and left. What is that indicator for? I can't get in. My hands hurt.

171
00:55:42,219 --> 00:55:57,659
And this doesn't do anything. I can't eat this either. Right. Is that one, there's one spot to go

172
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:32,889
over here. Can I go anywhere else from here? I think I already did. I'll just eat. I have eaten

173
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:57,130
completely. Maybe it was just sleep. I missed one to the left, but down. Eat and then sleep.

174
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:14,360
Eat and then sleep. Uh, is this just a shelter writer? Well, um, God, this Barry's over there,

175
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:28,860
though. Where the hell am I going? Um, what is, what is that? It's like a, like a villain vine.

176
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:43,400
Don't touch that. That's like an evil vine. Don't eat it. Can I, can I buy it? It's like,

177
00:57:44,599 --> 00:58:45,139
right or something. Eat, eat. Uh, this is a dead end. What's this one? Also a dead end.

178
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:54,300
You gotta hurry. Oh fuck. All right. This is, I know there's something down here though. All

179
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:01,500
right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Um, but is that thing gonna, is this thing alive?

180
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:14,010
This thing looks, it's alive, isn't it? Get out of the fucking way, man. Get out of the fucking way.

181
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:24,840
Go get, fight each other or something. Go down there and start getting attacked and run away.

182
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:46,550
Run. Out. Out. Out. Get out of the way. Oh, come on. Get out of the way. What? I grabbed it.

183
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:54,500
I grabbed it before and it didn't do anything. I just lost fucking points for that.

184
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:08,389
I was, can I get off of that? Yeah, that was horrible. All right. Let's do, let's do it again.

185
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:14,809
Same place. I want to go to the same place. That fucking stupid lizard didn't go like this way,

186
01:00:14,809 --> 01:00:18,409
that way, this way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way. I would have been fine.

187
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,599
He was scared of the vine. He eventually did it.

188
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:47,300
Uh-uh. Auto, just wait that way. That was, that's very cute. What a cute dog.

189
01:00:49,179 --> 01:01:01,530
All right. Again, all the way to the left. And then we go down. Just wait that way. Just wait

190
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:21,900
that way. Just wait that way. Can't get into G. All right. It's tempting, but don't do it.

191
01:01:22,460 --> 01:02:10,980
Just got to go down. Very. Eat, stand up and eat. What are you doing? Eat. Where's the other one?

192
01:02:13,110 --> 01:03:09,340
Over there. All right. Give me, uh, give me a couple of bats. Hey, but wait, I'm good. I could

193
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:30,599
explore. I need, want to eat a couple of bats. Come here. Just wait. They'll come back out.

194
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:34,119
I wouldn't even ready for it. I wouldn't even ready for the bat when it came out. I wouldn't

195
01:03:34,119 --> 01:04:31,929
even ready. Did I let you go? What am I fishing? Oh, fuck. He got it. You. All right. Let's get

196
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:57,909
back. What is this thing? Is this evil? That looks like an evil plant. It is. It is evil.

197
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:17,800
I'm going to bed. Get me out. So I got to go. It was down. Where was it? Down to the right.

198
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:35,059
Watch out. He's all right. Get me in here. Delta. Nice. Delta. Watch out for the vine.

199
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:40,329
All right. Well, now at least I get to go back up where it was.

200
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:58,380
Hold on. I have to like crack my chest. What do I think of this game? It's pretty, it's fun. It's

201
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:15,590
good. It's very, very interesting. It's very fun. All right. Now I want to go. I want to go down.

202
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:30,409
Wait. Somebody said there was an evil vine down here. Oh my God. It was this one. I want to go

203
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:40,099
down. Can I go down from here? I don't think I can go down from here. Oh, I hate this thing.

204
01:06:40,659 --> 01:07:00,059
Can I go down here? No, no, no, no. Don't. Don't even. Come on. Really? Really? You're going to

205
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:08,840
dump through two alligators on me. I got to go through this. Okay. There's berries here.

206
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:46,360
What is that thing? What the hell is that? Why are they doing this? A snake? I'm going down.

207
01:07:46,360 --> 01:08:02,099
Uh, is we're beetle coming over here. All right. I got full, uh, I got full food.

208
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:16,840
Where is this? I'm going to go down. It's just water. It's fine.

209
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:38,039
Sandbox item unlocked. Sandbox item. New arenas unlocked. Hello? What was that? Open the door.

210
01:09:38,039 --> 01:10:13,460
Open. Open the door. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. Rainage system. Wink.

211
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:37,319
Wink. Why am I going over here to swim with this guy? Hold on. I hear Otto. I think I have to go

212
01:10:37,319 --> 01:10:50,119
talk to Otto. Otto is like, okay, let me go get Otto. Am I dead? Why can I not go in there anymore?

213
01:10:51,720 --> 01:11:32,710
Wait, what? I hold on. I can let me go get Otto. I'll be right back. So you can drown. You can

214
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:49,079
drown. I guess I am an animal. It makes sense. Show Otto. Hey. Hey, you. You want to be on camera?

215
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:57,750
Please read important to sewers. Uh, you're going the wrong way. This is not the way you

216
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:11,109
would have gone wrong way. It's an optional hard area. Otto, you want to go out on camera?

217
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:42,100
Uh, he doesn't want to be on camera. He wants, he wants to go outside.

218
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,579
He's like, oh, I didn't want to come in here, dude. He's like, I want you to take me out.

219
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:54,869
He's like, get me out of here. Get me out of here.

220
01:12:54,869 --> 01:17:06,819
He wants to go outside. I'll be right back. He also wanted some food. I gave him some food.

221
01:17:07,619 --> 01:17:14,380
He's just down there having a good time with Otto. I just drowned too, didn't I?

222
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:38,979
Did I, did I devolve again? I did, didn't I? On a scale of one. Just wait. That way. Just wait.

223
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:44,819
Oh my fucking God. And that concludes the super stream. I'm done.

224
01:17:45,699 --> 01:18:03,739
Oh, that's evolved again. Fuck. Oh, come on. That was the best 20 minutes ever.

225
01:18:05,659 --> 01:18:26,939
Fuck no. One. All right. One more try. What are you doing here? Get out of here. This is,

226
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:31,779
Oh, we both did the same thing. Are we both streaming the same time?

227
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:36,420
What are you afraid of me? He's afraid of me. Wait, he's afraid of me. He's afraid of me. Can I kill

228
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:45,079
him? He's afraid of me. All right. No, no, no. Wait, no. Eat. Eat him. No, wait. Do you want him?

229
01:18:45,880 --> 01:19:01,319
Wait, eat him. You have him. You can have him here. You can have him. What? Oh shit. Don't move.

230
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:29,380
Can you see me if I don't move? Get over here. Idiot. I want to touch that thing, right?

231
01:19:33,819 --> 01:19:54,779
Act for safe. Face cam. Okay. Same deal. I want to go back down, but this time don't go into the

232
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:59,430
sewer. Am I going into the sewer? Is there, there's nowhere else to go from here, right?

233
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:10,920
I can go up. Can I eat these bugs? The sewer is a big no. Okay.

234
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:20,819
Fuck. Come on. Do it. All right. Okay. Let's try to, let's try to crack my ribs.

235
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:39,960
God damn it. Why does my rib cage have to suck? What's wrong with him? I'm trying to,

236
01:21:39,960 --> 01:22:22,550
I'm trying to like push my rib cage. So I go, hold on. Ah, auto step on it. It's not going to work.

237
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:33,609
Okay. All right. So those of you that don't know what's happening. So I have costochondritis.

238
01:22:34,939 --> 01:22:41,460
And sometimes it's fucking really, really hurts like in here and like back here. So if I.

239
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:58,729
Okay. We're good. Yeah. It's a pain in the ass. It's a real pain in the ass. You just got

240
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:05,979
diagnosed with that too. Are you serious? It sucks. It's a real, it's a, I'm not touching the flower.

241
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:19,770
What do I want to go from here? Can I go up from this way?

242
01:23:31,909 --> 01:23:49,000
Oh, I'm going to call it. I'm going to call it here. Yeah. It's probably a good idea.

243
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:57,750
So I can stretch it and move around and probably take a bath. Yeah. I don't want to push it. You

244
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:06,680
know, it's from, if I'm sitting down, you want to do stretch stretching with German. There we go.

245
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:31,140
Ready? Oh, okay. Okay. That feels good. Sweaty yoga. If I push my chest out like this, it feels

246
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:42,520
better. I felt pretty good. Did that feel good for you guys chat? You will full screen. No,

247
01:24:42,520 --> 01:25:04,779
I'm so disgusting right now. All right. Ready? You know, what actually feels really great

248
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:24,359
is if I bear hug myself and like squeeze pimple on nose. Oh, I'm, I'm hugging you guys.

249
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Come over here. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I got as much as I want to stick around for another hour or so.

250
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:46,170
I'm going to call it here. I'll call it here. I'll call. I got to take care of my body. Drink plenty

251
01:25:46,170 --> 01:26:00,840
of water. Yeah. I think it's, you know what it is. Maybe it's the way I'm like, I don't have my

252
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:14,220
boomer brace on idiot. I'm not wearing my boomer brace and I'm sitting here for eight and a half

253
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:21,289
hours. What the fuck am I thinking? Actual idiot rookie mistake. Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll slow

254
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:28,020
it down here. We'll call it here. I'll be live tomorrow with, uh, either mega man legends or

255
01:26:29,659 --> 01:26:46,409
Nintendo Wii. Last stream ever. That's not true. Uh, no more heroes is on the table,

256
01:26:50,489 --> 01:26:57,050
but I kind of want to play the bachelor. I could keep playing this too tomorrow.

257
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:03,420
Maybe we could start with this or start with a Wii or something because this game is actually

258
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:28,899
pretty fun. Rain world and then the bachelor two quality games. All right. I'll see you guys

259
01:27:28,899 --> 01:27:35,079
tomorrow. Uh, tomorrow we're going to start at the normal time. So we're not starting at

260
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:42,010
noon tomorrow. We'll be starting around two. Thanks for sticking around. I'm glad at least

261
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,649
I got to sit here for at least eight and a half hours, a little more because we're doing the end

262
01:27:44,649 --> 01:27:50,869
of the stream. So I'll see you guys tomorrow. I'm going to say this would be nine hours,

263
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:59,859
nine hours. Have a great night guys. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves.

264
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:08,729
I can stretch and wear a boomer brace if you need to. Nine hour streams of fun. Yeah. I just,

265
01:28:08,729 --> 01:28:12,329
I really should have been wearing this. It really crept up on me. The last like 40 minutes

266
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:19,050
it was okay, but it really just, no, it just fucking crept up on me pretty hard here in the

267
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:27,859
last like 20 minutes. Don't know why. What's this called? It's called costochondritis inflammation

268
01:28:27,859 --> 01:28:33,939
in my rib cage that connects where my sternum connects in my chest and on my spine. It's a

269
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:45,829
beauty, but I was, I was getting to the end anyways. That probably wasn't going to stream

270
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:52,220
for more than another 30, 40 minutes in that game. So it's all good. I'm good to go. All right. What

271
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:58,380
do you say? Let's do the bits and the subs and all that great stuff. All the support you guys give

272
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:14,250
the stream. Thank you guys. Uh, do I, where's my stream? Let's go open it up, but we'll see

273
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:22,920
tomorrow. I'm going to go take a nice hot bath and then an immediate cold bath. That'd be awesome.

274
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:31,800
Freak.

275
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:48,869
That sounds like hell. Cold plunge. Dual welding bath. He's tempering himself.

276
01:29:50,779 --> 01:29:58,300
Hey, I'm a pain. Thanks for the 250. Hot wheels. Thanks for the thousand bits. Dermot, I've been

277
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:02,779
lurking for years, but finally subbed for two months. Two months ago. Thank you for that.

278
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:07,539
And I wanted to give you some bits and tell you that you've been a significant part of my teenage

279
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:13,699
years. On Friday, I had an interview at Universal Studios to work with the film studio. It's the job

280
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:19,380
of my dreams. I find out if I get the job next week and I just wanted you to know that you got

281
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:24,869
me through some of the hardest moments in my life. Thanks, Dermot. That's pretty awesome. Hot wheels.

282
01:30:24,869 --> 01:30:36,810
That sounds like an awesome job. Hopefully you get it. Good luck to you. We got a movie star coming

283
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:45,239
up potentially here. Seriously though, I wish you the best of luck. Thanks for the thousand bits.

284
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:52,659
Autumn Dragons. Thanks for the 250. Hi, Dermot. I'm getting back into the Mega Man series after

285
01:30:52,659 --> 01:30:56,739
nearly a decade and I can't wait to watch you stream Mega Man Legends, be it tomorrow

286
01:30:56,739 --> 01:31:04,260
or today. And now a question for you. Okay. All right. How much of the many Mega Man series are

287
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:11,609
you into? Mega Man X is the only one I really actually played, if I'm going to be completely

288
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:18,569
honest. Mega Man X is really... Mega Man X and Mega Man X 2. The ones for Super Nintendo.

289
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:23,930
The only ones that I really cared about. I played the original one or two or three of them

290
01:31:24,569 --> 01:31:32,340
for the regular Nintendo. But once I got past two or three, I was just done. I was just like,

291
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:41,319
ah, that was fun. And then Mega Man X came out. I really got into that. I played Mega Man Legends

292
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:53,909
too as well. Regular Nintendo versus the Super Nintendo. That's right. Yeah. Not aware I left

293
01:31:53,909 --> 01:32:01,590
them. Wembley. Thanks for the 250, Dermot. I've been playing the 500 sub video before working out

294
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:08,409
to get me pumped up for lifting. It's a good video to do too. Any good tips for working out?

295
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:15,770
Not anymore. And I feel like people probably have so much better stuff to say about lifting

296
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:20,649
than I do now because I just haven't done it in so long. I've been out of that for like seven

297
01:32:20,649 --> 01:32:27,899
plus years at this point, truly. So I don't really have any advice for it anymore.

298
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:38,310
Just eat balanced food. Eat a balanced diet. And don't eat tahini paste every day like I did.

299
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:43,239
It's not good for you. I mean, it is good for you, but not in a high amount of quantities.

300
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:52,840
Thank you, though. Good luck on your workout journey. Curr Bumble. Thanks for the 500 bits.

301
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,810
Will you be able to give any kind of heads up for the GameCube stream? I really want to make

302
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:00,970
sure I don't miss you playing Gotcha Force. And I still can't believe you even know that exists.

303
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:06,579
Oh, yeah, that's I will make it very clear that what I'm going to be playing

304
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:12,760
because I want a chibi robo and Gotcha Force are going to be back to back probably.

305
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:25,850
And then of course, I got Super Mario Sunshine too. That is the case. I can't wait for chibi

306
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:32,390
robo, man. That's going to be so much fun. I don't even know if I'm going to like that game,

307
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:41,479
but I'm going to play it. And it was a ton of money. We'll see. But yeah, I'll definitely let

308
01:33:41,479 --> 01:33:45,079
you guys know when I'm going to be doing the GameCube streams. It'll probably be

309
01:33:48,649 --> 01:33:55,859
probably either next weekend or the week after that. But like the week of that, like the 24th,

310
01:33:55,859 --> 01:33:59,859
25th, maybe because it's still I have a couple things planned for the next few days.

311
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:07,640
We'll see all of one zombie. Thanks to the 250 you ever considered instead of a wink,

312
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:12,760
you could read popsicle stick caliber jokes that wouldn't require the webcam. I'd buy a joke book

313
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:19,130
so you don't die of a heart attack after three months. Somebody also suggested you read a line

314
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:33,539
from a children's book. Just have jokes open. Well, yeah, that's pretty good idea. But then

315
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:39,109
I'm going to get a shitload of minus two. It's the shit I didn't even say. If I read popsicle

316
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:45,399
stick jokes, people are going to minus two every time it happens. See, they're already doing it.

317
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:52,819
I didn't even do anything. Well, that's the joke. Ah, fine. I'll get it. I'll do some research on

318
01:34:52,819 --> 01:35:00,279
that. And be farming minus two is yeah. Apple shift. Thanks for the 250. Hey, what's your

319
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:04,939
favorite accent to hear and favorite accent to do? Favorite accent to hear is

320
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:15,689
Irish and favorite accent to do is Irish. Done. Also, happy, happy late Valentine's Day. Thank

321
01:35:15,689 --> 01:35:24,420
you. Apple shift. I appreciate it. Happy Valentine's Day to you too. It's too bad you suck at it.

322
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:32,949
I really don't. Sometimes I do. But like, for instance, right now, it's, it's not very bad.

323
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:39,689
It is pretty bad. But it's been eight and a half hours. Almost nine hours. That's not even bad.

324
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:47,720
That's fine. That's not even bad. That's not bad. That's not very bad. That was good. That sounded

325
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:56,340
like I came right from Ireland. Hey, nondescript civilian. Thanks for the thousand bits. Bravely

326
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:19,239
default OST, please. Maybe next time. Ireland, Missouri. What the fuck? Gnarly. Thanks for the

327
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:23,399
250. I hope one of the 20 games you bought is Bowser's Inside Story. Sorry to tell you it's not.

328
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:28,390
In all seriousness, though, have you ever, you ever going to stream an RPG in the future?

329
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:37,159
I have Chrono Trigger installed. You remember for three or four months ago, I talked about how

330
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:42,060
I wanted to play that. I remember after Mario RPG was like, what would you do next? And I was like,

331
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:48,520
well, Chrono Trigger is one of my favorite games ever made. And then I saw Vinny was playing it.

332
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:55,460
And I was like, well, great minds fucking think alike. Great minds have 500 IQ together. Remember

333
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:58,260
when I was playing Diablo 2 and he came over, he was like, oh, this is like my favorite game ever.

334
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:18,810
Well, yeah, like brilliant fucking incredible minds think alike. You like Chrono Trigger,

335
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:25,350
but not Final Fantasy. Great minds also click 13.8 clicks per second. Yeah.

336
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:37,819
Oh, you motherfuckers. I forgot about that. It's been a long stream. It's been like kind of a long

337
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:44,869
day. I've like forgot that that happened. That was if I, I was going against somebody streaming

338
01:37:45,829 --> 01:37:49,989
my face and shit and, and I, they were beating me and oh, that was wild.

339
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:57,350
Hey, whole of one zombie. Thanks for the 250. I tried eating some raw tahini. It tastes like

340
01:37:57,350 --> 01:38:06,149
sand. You think the beach tastes like hummus? How would you eat raw tahini? Unless you were trying

341
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:15,770
to do the dumb thing I was doing, which is not smart and you shouldn't do it. Derma 13. Thanks

342
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:22,489
for the 250 bits. Uh, nine eight five. We've got a problem. The old warehouse has been reactivated

343
01:38:22,489 --> 01:38:28,409
presumably by a malicious actor and the defective models have gone missing. Commissioner Derma 3

344
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:33,529
wants to see you in for some questions by Wednesday. And yes, this likely means that Derma 65

345
01:38:33,529 --> 01:38:44,819
is back online and is already planning his next move. That doesn't sound good. That does not

346
01:38:44,819 --> 01:39:01,050
sound good. It's okay though. I am the 905th, 985th iteration of this thing. I've got fucking all

347
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:05,210
kinds of like, I've got laser fingers and shit. He doesn't have that. I'll be fine.

348
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:14,340
He had programmed him with one eye. So I got two of those. I'll be okay. We're going to be fine.

349
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:20,100
Don't worry. Derma 13 again. Thanks for the 250. Uh, additionally, we have reason to believe that

350
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:24,500
model 65 has been retrofitted with the experimental Jax module that was designed for you. Well, now

351
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:28,659
you've got me a little bit concerned and is now posing an even more serious threat. We need to

352
01:39:28,659 --> 01:39:36,359
act fast. Hope we can rely on your help. 13 out. Well, why did, why did you guys let this happen?

353
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:50,329
What the fuck are you guys doing over there? Good luck. Hey Reaper, thanks for the 250. Hey

354
01:39:50,329 --> 01:39:54,649
Derma, this paperclip game is too boring that I actually fell asleep for an hour. I just woke

355
01:39:54,649 --> 01:40:01,939
up and I can see that I missed nothing. You missed me. Come on. Thank you. Hey Peaceful

356
01:40:01,939 --> 01:40:09,510
Haley, thanks for the 250. Derma got some good news. I got affiliate. Sick. It only took me a

357
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:14,630
month or so. And yesterday when you didn't stream, I did. And I got nine fucking subs

358
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:19,779
first day on affiliate. Fuck yeah. I want to say thanks to the chat members who supported me. You

359
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:23,859
guys are awesome. And thank you. Derma as well for inspiring me. Who knows? I may rival you someday.

360
01:40:23,859 --> 01:40:36,949
Well, let's fucking go. Bring it on. Okay. I can't yell anymore. That like hurt the O and on just

361
01:40:36,949 --> 01:40:45,460
like hurt my back. I'm all right. I just want, you know, sometimes, you know, sometimes I just

362
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:50,020
want to just go into the dryer and turn it on. You know what I mean? Like maybe I'll feel better

363
01:40:50,020 --> 01:41:01,979
when I get out. Like just like, I feel good. That was a good dryer therapy. But good luck Haley.

364
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:13,079
That's, that's pretty sick. Nice work. RNG physical therapy. Yeah. I got another appointment to go to.

365
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:26,140
I have another appointment to go to. I'm doing PT twice a week now. So yeah, let's hope it works.

366
01:41:26,779 --> 01:41:41,859
Thank you Haley for the 250. Thank you Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250. If you always wanted,

367
01:41:41,859 --> 01:41:49,779
you can go into a money exchange and ask for the Iranian rile, the Venezuelan sovereign boulevard

368
01:41:49,779 --> 01:41:56,949
and remember to get a few wheelbarrows to take the money home. I don't like they have those just

369
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:08,729
in your local bank. Do they? Cause I'm not even sure they carry Canadian. If some of them do maybe.

370
01:42:10,329 --> 01:42:13,529
Hey, Peter, thanks for the, oh, the inflation thing. Right. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

371
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:18,250
Hey, Peter, thanks for the 300 bits. They say cool guy. Back at it again. Cool guy. Thank you,

372
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:26,260
Peter. Uh, itachi. Thanks for the 300 bits. No message, just 300 bits. Five community subs from

373
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:32,710
Peter. Thanks for the subs, Peter. 20 community subs. We caught it earlier from Morkus Borkus.

374
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:41,739
Thank you, Morkus. Thousand bits from Mr. Him. Thanks for the 10 bucks, Mr. Him. Money from my

375
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:52,310
favorite e-clan. Love you, Jerma. Thank you. Thanks for the thousand bits. Jujojrotter.

376
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:57,029
Thanks for the 500 bits. They say hi. Thanks for the five dollars. Hi, back to you.

377
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:12,859
Jujrotter. Jujrotter. All right. Mr. Him gave five dollars on top of the 10 dollars. Thank you,

378
01:43:12,859 --> 01:43:24,840
Mr. Him. Appreciate that. Hey, many rabbits. Thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it, many rabbits.

379
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:30,699
My best friend from college was sent back to Brazil after I graduated. We got into contact

380
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:36,380
again three years later. In our first conversation after three years, we found out we both were on

381
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:41,739
your stream together for months without knowing it. One of the most surreal and happy coincidences

382
01:43:41,739 --> 01:43:45,819
I've experienced in my life. Thank you for so many hours of pure joy. Holy shit, that's awesome.

383
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:51,779
It's given me the capability of changing my life for the better since then. You're a great

384
01:43:51,779 --> 01:43:58,680
entertainer and a wonderful person. That's really, really, that's really awesome. That's so weird. I

385
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:05,800
can't imagine how fucking weird that would be. Imagine just like, that's pretty cool. Thanks,

386
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:21,029
many rabbits, and go where your friend is. Thanks to them too. Appreciate it. Gooberry Juice. Thanks

387
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:30,010
for the 250. Jeremy, here the score is currently of people racing you. Oh, I've, I already won.

388
01:44:30,569 --> 01:44:38,659
Well, did I win? How many of you guys were playing this when I was playing it? Poseidon Shadow has

389
01:44:38,659 --> 01:44:44,500
about 50 million beat that person. If he's best, he wasn't racing you. He was figuring out Windows

390
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:52,010
2000. Okay. Fluffy Dragon would have beaten you, but his computer froze. He still might beat you.

391
01:44:53,020 --> 01:45:00,359
Hexerman, about 20 million and going. You got this. Roju, 150 quadrillion. Pog,

392
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:15,619
Redski, 300,000. Don't give up. Hey, Tangy, thanks for the 250. Last month, Cheez-It was finally

393
01:45:15,619 --> 01:45:19,979
brought to Canada. What, you just didn't have Cheez-Its? So I bought a box to try them and they

394
01:45:19,979 --> 01:45:23,829
were better than I expected. I always thought that you were over-exaggerating, but they really

395
01:45:23,829 --> 01:45:37,210
are better than any cheese flavored cracker. Yeah. Welcome to the dark side. They never were in

396
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:45,399
Canada. That's weird. That is really weird. Why? I feel like they should be. I feel like they would

397
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:55,720
be. Hey, Jules, thanks for the 250, Jules. And they say, Hey, Germa, my brother said that while

398
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:59,239
he was watching one of your streams a long time ago, you said your name originated from you not

399
01:45:59,239 --> 01:46:04,199
washing your hands after using the toilet. The toilet handle and your privates are full of germs.

400
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:19,029
Hence the name Germa. Please tell me this isn't true. Typical tip was older brother. Is it an

401
01:46:19,029 --> 01:46:24,380
older brother? Typical older brother. Don't listen to a goddamn word that he has to say.

402
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:47,560
Older brother. Real wink. Hold on. Oh my God. Teyon, thanks for the 250 bits. I was racing you

403
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:55,000
I beat you by the way, but to be honest, I had no idea what I was doing 90% of the time.

404
01:46:55,720 --> 01:47:04,300
That was, it was a fun game. I had a lot of fun. We could just sit there and talk and just hang

405
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:20,340
out. Stretch. I might need to like, I might actually, I might take a little walk. I'm going

406
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:28,619
to take like a lubricated walk. I don't know what that means, but I feel like I do. Hey, Bitslave,

407
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:35,989
thanks for the 300 bits. Appreciate it Bitslave. Germa, it's me Bitslave again. And it would mean

408
01:47:35,989 --> 01:47:39,350
the world to me. You didn't say that. It would mean a lot to me if you checked out my video on

409
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:44,500
the gamer drink of the day. Thanks for buying with wonderful and gaming drink of the day.

410
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:59,609
This is like, this is like, this is alcohol. So how is this? Why is this a gamer drink?

411
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:11,670
Maker's Mark, Kentucky. Why is this? Why is this a gamer drink? Maker's Mark,

412
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:20,119
Kentucky bourbon whiskey. It's handmade. It's distilled, aged and bottled by the Maker's

413
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:26,600
Mark distillery incorporated in Star Hill Farm, Loretto, Kentucky, USA. All right.

414
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:40,220
Let's get this started. What are you doing? Are you going to drink it? You didn't like it.

415
01:48:40,220 --> 01:49:01,880
You didn't like it. You clicked on an ad. You clicked on an ad. Shit. Let's get this started.

416
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:11,939
Well, I'm a Johnny Walker guy myself, but you know, ads are getting out of control.

417
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:18,039
Thank you Bitslave for the review. But it wasn't even a review. You just drank it and went,

418
01:49:18,039 --> 01:49:28,340
ow. Will you marry me? Don't get me wrong. It'll be in name only. After we're married,

419
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:32,500
you'd still be free. You can date anyone you want. I mean, you can sleep with anyone you like. I don't

420
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:35,619
mean to be rude, but I'm not physically attracted to you. I'm sorry. What it means is I'm not

421
01:49:35,619 --> 01:49:40,100
attracted to any streamer. All my relationships are with real men. I won't touch you. We'll go

422
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,939
to a hospital, have artifice. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for the grant. Thanks for the five dollars.

423
01:49:44,899 --> 01:49:51,380
Chris Bach. Thanks for the five dollars and 10 cents. Thanks for letting me shut off my brain

424
01:49:51,380 --> 01:50:00,409
for 20 minutes watching your stream. You're welcome. It's news and comfort. Thanks for the

425
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:04,170
400 bits. I don't know if it's funny or sad, but all the recent times you've played a game,

426
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:09,130
I recommended. Chat hated it. Anyway, next time you play music on stream, can you finally play

427
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:14,329
the Yonoid 2 into the Void OST? Write it down somewhere. I've been wanting you to play that

428
01:50:14,329 --> 01:50:21,380
for ages. All right. I'm going to keep it in a tab right now. We'll play it tomorrow. Also,

429
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:32,329
you can play the game too, to be honest. Yonoid 2. Wasn't there like a coffee

430
01:50:32,329 --> 01:50:40,310
pasta about that like seven hours ago? I got it open. We're going to play it tomorrow.

431
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:42,710
Spliceable Spleen. Thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.

432
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:47,189
For real though, thanks for the 300 bits. Since you recently said your favorite 40k

433
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:52,470
faction was the communist space anime fish. I mean the Tao. What? I was thinking you should

434
01:50:52,470 --> 01:51:11,420
play 40k game like Fire Warrior. Baby. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey, let's get the credits

435
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:27,109
rolling. All right, it's rolling. I lean side to side. Let's build a gamer birdhouse. I already

436
01:51:27,109 --> 01:51:31,829
did that and everybody hated it. And like a thousand people, it's a favorite stream and

437
01:51:31,829 --> 01:51:36,890
like people like, I get gas lit saying that it was everyone loved it. Thanks for stopping guys.

438
01:51:37,609 --> 01:51:48,020
I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. See? I unironically loved that birdhouse. All right.

439
01:51:49,479 --> 01:51:59,220
See? Wasn't it nine hours long? No, it was not. How long was that stream? That was a nine hour

440
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:20,489
long stream. 12 hours? No, it wasn't. Why would it be that long? But here's all the subs from

441
01:52:20,489 --> 01:52:27,350
tonight. Thank you guys. We'll see you tomorrow. Still about four or five bits to do. We'll take

442
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:33,829
off. It was 14 hours combined. No, no, it was not. The longest stream I've ever done was like 13 and

443
01:52:33,829 --> 01:52:40,180
a half. Hey, Black Bear CJ. Thanks for the 300 bits. Have you tried putting your hands in the

444
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:43,699
prayer position behind your back or doing the over the shoulder behind your back,

445
01:52:43,699 --> 01:52:48,659
grabbing your hand, stretch to crack or unsolicited advice. I just have fibromyalgia

446
01:52:48,659 --> 01:52:51,939
and those two things. And those are two things that are always good for me.

447
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:59,350
Good to go for me to crack everything in my torso. You know, I have this foam roller

448
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:06,229
that if I lean back on and kind of roll back and stretch my arch, my back a little bit,

449
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:11,050
it just relieves so much pressure. And like, I feel like I have to go do that for like five

450
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:16,329
minutes or so. I don't really want to crack it. So, you know, I mean, that was just me

451
01:53:16,329 --> 01:53:21,210
venting frustration, but it's more so just stretching it and opening up the rib cage a

452
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:26,659
little bit. The worst part about something like costochondritis or what I've been told

453
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:33,619
is sometimes it just fucking disappears if it's just gone. You can have it for two months. You

454
01:53:33,619 --> 01:53:39,859
can have it for 10 years and it might just disappear forever one day gone and you'll never

455
01:53:39,859 --> 01:53:58,810
have it ever again. What the fuck? Foam rollers are Gucci. They're great. You just got to be

456
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:02,329
careful with the foam roller. You don't want to do it too low. If you do a foam roller low,

457
01:54:02,329 --> 01:54:06,170
it's really not that great for you when, you know, there's nothing to support it.

458
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:22,659
Costochondritis. Yeah, that is the term of what I have been diagnosed with. It's a pain in the

459
01:54:23,220 --> 01:54:30,739
ass. Costochondritis. Hey, it's Boo. Thanks for the 250. Hey, my birthday's next week and I'm

460
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:43,130
heading to Hash House. Not. What? Why would you say not? What are you trying to do here?

461
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:52,140
How many are there? At the link since I live in Summerlin. Going to the one on Sahara again,

462
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:58,380
but it was still awesome. What are your favorite meals? How many links are there in Vegas?

463
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:14,710
Not links. How many? No. At the link? What? At the link. If you're not going to... I thought

464
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:27,140
there were two? Three? I know there's two. There are three. Where's the third one? Where the fuck is

465
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:32,920
the third Hash House? Wait, hold on. I need to see this. I know the one that I go to all the fucking

466
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:42,300
time, but hold on. Hash House Go Go. Where is it? There are three? What's this fucking secret location

467
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:55,979
that I don't know about? There's like six. One, two, three, four, five. There are five Hash House

468
01:55:55,979 --> 01:56:04,329
Go Go's in Vegas. Holy fuck. I go to this one. One of the links is the best one. I refuse to

469
01:56:04,329 --> 01:56:11,050
think any of the other ones are any good. Go to the one at the link. You know, the thing that I sent

470
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:22,470
you. Business is booming since you mentioned it. Business is going to be booming all the time. It's

471
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:31,510
a 24-hour diner on the Las Vegas Strip. I think it's going to be just fine without me. What time

472
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:41,029
is the spring tomorrow? 2 p.m. Pacific. Hey, Shadow is one disciple. Thanks for the 250.

473
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:45,689
Oh, what am I? What are my favorite meals? The blue cheeseburger is the best thing on the menu.

474
01:56:45,689 --> 01:56:50,409
And then they have an awesome fried chicken. Blue cheese. All their burgers are the best.

475
01:56:50,409 --> 01:56:54,489
Blue cheeseburger is the fucking most incredible thing there. They have like a meatloaf sandwich

476
01:56:54,489 --> 01:57:03,060
is thousand out of 10. Shadow is one disciple though. Thanks for the 250. Hello, Jeremy.

477
01:57:03,699 --> 01:57:06,899
When you're in the process of reading this bit message, I will redeem the German wink.

478
01:57:08,949 --> 01:57:13,590
All right. Whether you eliminate the German wink TM or raise it to an exorbitant amount of channel

479
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:20,699
points, it is likely that you will never German wink at my behest ever again. Thus, my request is,

480
01:57:20,699 --> 01:57:26,260
even though I know you hate performing the German wink TM, that you may enjoy this particular wink

481
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:49,739
and cherish it. Wow, you really did do it. Cherished it. Thank you, Shadow is one disciple.

482
01:57:50,380 --> 01:58:03,850
And that's the end of the stream. I will see you guys. Have a great rest of your night. Take care,

483
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:09,529
guys. I'm going to go walk in a circle, stretch my legs, stretch my back. Let me take a bath.

484
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:17,829
I'm going to be wearing my boomer brace tomorrow. That's for sure. Thanks for watching. See you

485
01:58:17,829 --> 01:58:24,359
tomorrow. And we have a couple more. Reaper just came in 250. Okay, Jeremy, just admit the real

486
01:58:24,359 --> 01:58:28,039
reason you stopped YouTube is because you forgot your password. That's the reason why you never

487
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:32,119
did an I'm streaming now or a goodbye vid. I should let you know that YouTube can get your

488
01:58:32,119 --> 01:58:36,199
password back so you can start uploading again. I did the I'm streaming now video.

489
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,779
But one of my my last video is talking about how I'm going to be streaming like three or

490
01:58:41,779 --> 01:58:47,699
four times a week with a schedule. I made that video. I didn't make a goodbye forever. I'm never

491
01:58:47,699 --> 01:58:57,979
going to make a video again video I did. I'm streaming video. I talk about like Tuesday,

492
01:58:57,979 --> 01:59:02,220
Thursday and Friday. We're going to be streaming on twitch.tv. I made that video.

493
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:13,720
I remember saying those words. I didn't need my mic down here. Nile Orion. Thanks for 300 bits.

494
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:17,239
I had a dream that I started a Pro League of Legends team and you are our top laner.

495
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:22,920
But we would have lost every game. Hopefully we won games in your dream,

496
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:29,829
because that would not happen in reality. Hey, I'm geese. Thanks for the 250. Hi,

497
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:34,390
Jerma. Every time my friend comes into chat, she says I'm Jeremy Wormy and you never say hi back.

498
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:44,069
Hi, Jeremy Wormy. Hi, Jeremy Wormy. You never say hi back. There's like 7000 people here today.

499
01:59:45,029 --> 02:00:01,449
I'm sorry. What is making that sound? Do you guys hear this? I'm sorry. I'll try to catch it next

500
02:00:01,449 --> 02:00:08,779
time. I'm sorry. Hey, future gamer. Thanks for the 250. PSA to cure hiccups. Take a big breath in

501
02:00:08,779 --> 02:00:15,720
and swallow twice. I've gone many days suffering hiccups without this knowledge. All right,

502
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:23,260
I'll remember that the next time. That face when Jeremy Wormy doesn't reply to all your messages.

503
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:30,489
Don't do that. You'll shit your pants. I'm not a doctor. This person's not a doctor and you're

504
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:34,569
not a doctor. That was three doctors that just said things that doctors don't say.

505
02:00:35,449 --> 02:00:41,460
So take all this advice of the grain of salt. All right, see you tomorrow, guys. Goodbye.

506
02:00:41,460 --> 02:00:48,649
Just crossed nine hours. I'm glad I could do a longer one. Sorry, I had to stop, but it was

507
02:00:48,649 --> 02:00:56,069
probably going to stop around this time anyway. So I'm going to go foam roll for a little bit and

508
02:00:56,069 --> 02:01:00,010
I'll see you guys tomorrow at two o'clock Pacific. I've got a lot of things to play

509
02:01:00,729 --> 02:01:19,510
and there's a wink right there. Don't worry. I'm not going to miss it. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

510
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:33,829
I'll see you tomorrow. Where's the Vinny raid? Vinny raid, Vinny raid, Vinny raid, raid, raid,

511
02:01:33,829 --> 02:01:37,109
raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid, raid. Who's streaming

512
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:58,659
right now? Let's see. What's Vinny doing? Chrono Trigger. He's playing Chrono Trigger of this game

513
02:01:59,609 --> 02:02:07,859
and this is the finale. The finale of Chrono Trigger. Here comes spoilers for Chrono Trigger.

514
02:02:08,579 --> 02:02:17,180
Chrono Trigger, end of the game spoilers, but this is like my favorite game. I have to.

515
02:02:18,939 --> 02:02:30,060
In the middle of my playthrough. He's played it so many times.

516
02:02:36,869 --> 02:02:40,789
Let's say hi to Taleks. Let's say hi to him. What, he's playing Rimworld? All right, let's say hi to

517
02:02:40,789 --> 02:02:52,090
Taleks. Yeah, that's too much spoilers. No spoilers. Let's say hello.

518
02:02:54,090 --> 02:03:02,100
Oh, I'm German high five. Yeah, if he's at the very, very, very end of the game. Yeah.

519
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:29,289
All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.
