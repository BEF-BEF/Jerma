1
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:16,329
What's up? How's it going?

2
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,299
What's happening?

3
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,769
No fucking way.

4
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:27,420
What do you mean? Like no way that I'm here?

5
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,019
No way. No way.

6
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,170
What? What's going on here?

7
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,030
Are you that shocked that I'm streaming?

8
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,590
I can't believe this dude's actually streaming.

9
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,629
What the fuck?

10
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:46,739
Who the heck has he been?

11
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:54,950
All right, let me tweet this in one sec.

12
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,620
There we go.

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,599
My Twitter analytics must be absolute dogshit.

14
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,319
All of my tweets are either sponsored tweets or they're go live tweets.

15
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,280
And then sometimes, like once a year,

16
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,599
I'll have a tweet that has like five million views

17
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,319
and everything else is just way, way, way under that.

18
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,879
My analytics must be awful.

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,650
Must be like the shittiest analytics of any Twitter account.

20
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,229
Whatever. Who cares?

21
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,430
Did you tweet something funny?

22
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,580
That's, I guess, up to you.

23
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,740
Oh, I did have a fake Mario movie tweet that is...

24
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,370
I could read a draft or two. Why not?

25
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,139
Let's see what this one is.

26
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:59,599
Did I tell... Did I talk about this one?

27
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,479
All right, I'll read it.

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,610
Well, should I wait till people come in?

29
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:13,620
I actually like this one.

30
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,379
Chat faked an entire stream.

31
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:23,569
Yeah, I heard about that.

32
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,189
We'll get a chill.

33
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:26,030
Yeah, we're going to play...

34
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
All right, here's the plan.

35
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,229
I want to go over the weekend.

36
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:34,629
Yes, the plan is to be live today, tomorrow, and Sunday.

37
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,689
Today, we're going to play Papa's Freezeria.

38
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,050
Was it Freezeria?

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,050
Freezeria.

40
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,169
What the fuck?

41
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,169
I'm just realizing right now.

42
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:46,229
It's Freezeria.

43
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,110
Freezeria is what I thought it was.

44
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,389
For five, ten years.

45
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:55,150
Ten years ago, I called it Freezeria.

46
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,430
Why would I do that?

47
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm just... Why?

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,870
That's weird.

49
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,939
Anyways, you can't read?

50
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,639
I can read.

51
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,740
Freezeria isn't a word.

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Oh, wait, if you look up Freezeria in the dictionary,

53
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,939
is Papa's face there?

54
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:27,430
Is it better me?

55
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,750
All right, anyways, we're going to play this today.

56
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,029
We have Papa's Freezeria.

57
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,750
This is the deluxe version.

58
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,430
The deluxe version is on Steam now, apparently.

59
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:38,790
I don't know what that means.

60
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,129
I'm just going to chill and play it.

61
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:42,529
Tomorrow, we might play something else.

62
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:47,269
It depends on how long this one goes for.

63
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:51,610
Also, tomorrow, the plan is to do 90s ads.

64
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,170
Watch some old 90s ads.

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,480
It'll be fun.

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,480
And then Sunday, I want to do the House Flipper Farm DLC.

67
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:10,019
Looks like a pretty extensive update to that game.

68
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,670
But there's your weekend plan.

69
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,470
I think you can build your own house now

70
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,670
in House Flipper, right?

71
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,620
It looks like you can build a whole house from scratch.

72
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,459
I don't know why I made that sound

73
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:29,600
like it was a chocolate pudding recipe.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,439
All right, anyways, let's read this tweet,

75
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,050
this giraffe-ed tweet.

76
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,329
By the way, I want to make it really clear.

77
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,889
I have not seen the Mario movie,

78
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,329
so I don't even, we're just going to read this.

79
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,149
I've not seen the Mario movie.

80
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,550
I just watched the Mario movie

81
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,029
and was getting really fidgety and visibly annoyed.

82
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,839
They took way too long for the first Yahoo.

83
00:05:51,839 --> 00:06:01,220
It was all right.

84
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,819
Is it great? Send it.

85
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,220
I'm just imagining somebody sitting there

86
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,180
just fucking pissed, like fidgeting around,

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,100
like, where is it?

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,939
Come on.

89
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,009
Fucking God damn it.

90
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,569
And Holly said something funny.

91
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,769
She's like, we haven't seen this movie.

92
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:23,769
What if Mario does a Yahoo in the first like 10 seconds?

93
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,420
Like, wow, that really sounds fucked up, doesn't it?

94
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,180
Does it happen in the first 10 seconds?

95
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,879
Oh, they took way too long for the first Yahoo.

96
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,120
And if it happens in the first five minutes of the movie,

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,199
I don't know.

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,040
I thought that made it funnier.

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,589
He literally does.

100
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,879
He Yahoo's really quickly.

101
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,199
But that's the only reason he went to go to see the movie.

102
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:00,149
It's his first word in the movie?

103
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:07,100
Who cares?

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,860
It's literally the first word in the movie

105
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,370
and it's in the trailer.

106
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,550
Oh, they took way too fucking long for the first Yahoo.

107
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:24,639
I was fidgeting and annoyed in my seat.

108
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,360
All right.

109
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,819
Well, that's, there it is.

110
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,069
This movie is fired though.

111
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,670
Oh, we're definitely gonna see it.

112
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:42,209
Need to find some time to see it.

113
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,220
Okay.

114
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,550
So we're gonna play Papa's Freez-Area.

115
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,310
I'm a, I don't wanna say I'm a huge fan of the Papa games.

116
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,730
I've played them a few times.

117
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,089
Relax.

118
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,610
Pull up a chair.

119
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,860
If you're already sitting, then good.

120
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,899
I guess if you're already sitting down.

121
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,699
I actually don't even know how you play these.

122
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,170
They're kind of like Diner Dash, right?

123
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,009
They operate similarly.

124
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,410
If they like serve customers and they get mad

125
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,779
if you take too long, right?

126
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:19,759
No.

127
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,920
Oh, wait.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,180
Oh, that is how it is, isn't it?

129
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,019
Okay.

130
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,300
Well, let's go.

131
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,139
Here is Papa's Freez-Area.

132
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:34,980
Hey, there we go.

133
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,059
Okay.

134
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,980
Let's get started.

135
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,580
We'll do this one.

136
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,779
Create a custom worker.

137
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,580
I mean, we kind of have to do that, don't we?

138
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,519
Custom worker?

139
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,960
Yeah, this is, this is deluxe.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,580
I don't know what the deluxe means.

141
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,730
Okay.

142
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,690
Wait, you can change the position of your head?

143
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,509
Okay.

144
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:17,419
I can't, I'm all right with this.

145
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:26,809
You can do gamer neck or normal.

146
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,500
Oh, this is actually a lot.

147
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,230
How are there more hair options in Papa's Freez-Area

148
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,389
than half of the AAA games I've ever played?

149
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:45,639
Doesn't that kind of make you a little annoyed?

150
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,169
And I'm talking way more.

151
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,990
Okay, how about that?

152
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,539
Is there hair color?

153
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,860
It's 2D.

154
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,940
It's 2D.

155
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,460
Yeah.

156
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,799
Yeah, that's true.

157
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,100
Let's be fair.

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,230
We're definitely, we're going with the mustache 100%.

159
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,620
I could, hold on.

160
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Where's Bald?

161
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:43,559
I kind of want to make the Pringles guy.

162
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:53,610
What does the Pringles guy look like?

163
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,830
What does the Pringles guy look like?

164
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,179
Can I change the eyes?

165
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,600
Okay.

166
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
What does the Pringles,

167
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,149
the Pringles guy doesn't really have a mouth.

168
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,970
No, it's not like that.

169
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:20,370
The mustache covers the mouth.

170
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,929
The Pringles guy has hair.

171
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:22,769
He does?

172
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:28,549
Oh shit, he does.

173
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:29,909
He does have hair.

174
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:30,950
He has hair.

175
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,830
Why do I think he doesn't have hair?

176
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,789
I'm telling you right now,

177
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,909
the Pringles guy just did not have hair until right now.

178
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:44,350
Until you just all said it.

179
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,070
It's a middle part, isn't it?

180
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:57,889
It's like this, right?

181
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:58,889
Oh, let me look this up.

182
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,750
Pringles guy.

183
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,149
Pringles guy.

184
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,399
What does he look like?

185
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,450
He does have hair.

186
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,529
I'm thinking of the Monopoly man.

187
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,929
The Monopoly man has the mustache and is bald.

188
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:19,299
The Pringles guy has a middle part and a mustache.

189
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,809
Okay.

190
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, now I know.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,980
It's kind of this mustache as well.

192
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,340
Monopoly man has a top hat.

193
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:41,779
Yeah, he's still bald.

194
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:47,019
That looks pretty good.

195
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:47,860
This looks good.

196
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:54,259
I think this is fine.

197
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,220
Ooh, eyebrows.

198
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,120
Wait, should we get rid of the hair

199
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,610
and just do eyebrows for hair?

200
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,639
Kind of like that, isn't it?

201
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,090
Ah, that's too much work.

202
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,409
I don't think the eyebrows can be big enough

203
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:12,259
for that to make sense.

204
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,259
What's the biggest eyebrows?

205
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,370
These ones?

206
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't make these bigger.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,059
No brows.

208
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:41,389
He has no eyebrows.

209
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,259
All right, what was it?

210
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:53,299
It's the middle part or is it right here somewhere?

211
00:13:53,299 --> 00:14:04,909
Should we get, no eyebrows he's saying?

212
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,139
Okay, I think that's good.

213
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:13,049
What about glasses?

214
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:19,220
This feels like they updated the Pringles guy, right?

215
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,259
Doesn't it feel like, oh yeah, no, no,

216
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,500
we took the Pringles guy.

217
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,960
We wanted to update his look a little.

218
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:35,379
I don't like the updated Pringles guy.

219
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,059
Hey, we gave the Pringles guy glasses.

220
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:44,259
Oh, okay.

221
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:51,559
Hipster.

222
00:14:51,559 --> 00:15:00,129
I'm gonna keep it like this.

223
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,330
What do you mean no?

224
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,490
Hey guys, is that, my character's done.

225
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,610
No, it's not.

226
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,889
Yeah, it is, it's done.

227
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:11,309
I'm done, my character's done.

228
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:14,519
I'm keeping it like this.

229
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:25,509
I love the no.

230
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,429
All right, your chef's name.

231
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,389
What's my chef's name?

232
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,500
I don't know.

233
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,059
Oh, is the window too small?

234
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,620
No, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

235
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,659
Oh, wait.

236
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, shit, wait.

237
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
There we go, okay.

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,600
Name.

239
00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:01,129
How about just, Peter Pringle.

240
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,820
Melvin?

241
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,340
I like Melvin.

242
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,460
Melvin's kinda nice.

243
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,190
Yeah, I'll do Melvin.

244
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,720
Just Melvin.

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,960
All right, Melvin.

246
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,379
I'm ready.

247
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,549
Melvin's new job.

248
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,759
Let's go.

249
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,980
Worker's guide.

250
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,179
Calypso Island population.

251
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:31,409
Isn't there like 12 people that live here?

252
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,970
12 people on this whole island?

253
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,460
All right, hold on.

254
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,299
I was trying to make Papa.

255
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,059
Why have I combined every one of these characters?

256
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,139
I just look like a dickhead.

257
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:50,120
I look like I'm showing up to work pretending to be him.

258
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,659
I was trying to make him the whole time.

259
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:59,639
All right.

260
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,400
He really does look like the Pringles guy.

261
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,690
He can look like that, but I can't.

262
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,420
Okay, day one.

263
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,339
Welcome to Papa's Freezeria.

264
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,269
Let's get started with training, okay.

265
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:20,549
You'll copy down each customer's order

266
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,569
onto an order ticket.

267
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,410
Garlic on your,

268
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,759
what kind of person wants garlic on their ice cream?

269
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,680
Switch to the build station

270
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,920
and start preparing ice cream and ingredients, okay.

271
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,680
Watch the meter on the ice cream machine.

272
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,700
Wait until it's centered, then press the pour button.

273
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,259
Good.

274
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,339
All right, and now we need a mixable

275
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,119
from the mixable machine.

276
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,490
They want strawberries.

277
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,819
That was not very good.

278
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:56,960
They want strawberry syrup.

279
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,849
That's a little too many strawberries, don't you think?

280
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:02,170
Okay.

281
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,849
And then drag the cup onto the blender.

282
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:09,539
I've always wanted to see how this worked.

283
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,059
Watch the blend meter on the blender

284
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,579
and wait till it looks like what they ordered on the ticket.

285
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,259
Huh?

286
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:24,009
How long does this take?

287
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:24,849
Okay.

288
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:25,690
It's blended.

289
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,250
Ooh, it looks pretty good.

290
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,720
Now they want, oh, it's whipped cream.

291
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,559
Okay.

292
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,799
Well, I didn't know that when I,

293
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,009
I thought I had to click it.

294
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,529
It just goes?

295
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:45,539
It just starts going when I let go of the button.

296
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,049
I didn't press to do that.

297
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,730
Tap the shakers button.

298
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,569
What's your type of shakers?

299
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,140
This is too elaborate.

300
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,299
Okay.

301
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,410
Okay, and then drops.

302
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,359
Free cherries.

303
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,200
The sundae is finished.

304
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,359
Drag this over here.

305
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,440
All right, here you go.

306
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,420
What do you think?

307
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,259
It was awful.

308
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,819
Wait, the whipped cream was next to it.

309
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,339
Yeah, I thought you ordered it on the side.

310
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:29,069
It's like salad dressing.

311
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,309
All right, you want a medium blended Reese's

312
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,990
with chocolate, chocolate whipped cream,

313
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,269
double chocolate Oreos.

314
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:41,589
And then, okay.

315
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:45,150
I'm gonna do Reese's.

316
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,990
Reese's in there.

317
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,839
Chocolate, looks good.

318
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,279
Blend that up.

319
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,700
Needs to get to this consistency.

320
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,869
Medium rare ice cream.

321
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:07,710
Good.

322
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,019
All right, get it over here.

323
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:16,640
Next, I need a chocolate, chocolate whipped cream.

324
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,160
How do I stop it from doing that?

325
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,279
All right.

326
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,220
I go middle, I go middle out.

327
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,059
Do you guys do that?

328
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:24,900
How do you guys do it?

329
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,539
Do you guys go around the rim

330
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,380
and do a big swirl into the middle?

331
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,259
Or do you go middle?

332
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:33,500
So it goes and fills kind of out.

333
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,900
I like doing it like that, actually.

334
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,420
I think you get a good top from doing that.

335
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,869
You do a swirl.

336
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:46,539
All right, let's put some of this on.

337
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,380
Okay.

338
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,960
And then you want Oreos like this,

339
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,980
right in the middle, like this.

340
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,190
Let's go.

341
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,289
I gotta stop that from happening.

342
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:14,380
$5 tip, nice.

343
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:27,539
Not bad, not bad.

344
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,420
Took you a whole day to do two orders.

345
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,019
Well, that's because over the course of the whole day,

346
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,119
only two customers came in.

347
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,369
Gotcha.

348
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:36,410
Mini game show?

349
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,769
Use the game tickets you earned to play

350
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:42,089
in Fudini's daily mini game show.

351
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:45,140
What is this?

352
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,660
10 baddies.

353
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,319
What the?

354
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,779
Are these baddies?

355
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:51,619
What costume?

356
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,460
What is a baddie?

357
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,579
I don't get it.

358
00:21:53,579 --> 00:22:00,240
Am I winning?

359
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,079
Okay.

360
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,200
Ooh, I got a new shirt.

361
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,329
Let's do it again.

362
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:07,690
I've hit 11 baddies.

363
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,329
Does this keep going up?

364
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:13,569
Do I have unlimited ammo?

365
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:33,099
Is this the only thing I can do with this?

366
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:34,420
I feel like I'm playing the Resident Evil mini game

367
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,890
all over again.

368
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,430
Let's go.

369
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,549
Ooh, I got a table.

370
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:47,109
Decoration?

371
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:49,529
Okay.

372
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:51,029
Cool.

373
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:52,349
New clothes?

374
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:58,359
Yup.

375
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,890
What's that mean?

376
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:06,410
What's that mean?

377
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,529
Okay.

378
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:08,369
New.

379
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:09,750
Ooh, I can decorate my lobby.

380
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,390
Tap the open button to view and choose items

381
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,269
you purchased in the shop.

382
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:13,109
All right.

383
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:16,640
Here's the table.

384
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,119
First items that can be dragged to the front

385
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,119
or back areas of the floor.

386
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,359
Drag furniture to the red x-ray

387
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,000
to remove from the lobby.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,140
I think it's fine there.

389
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:38,480
Stickers?

390
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,410
Do I have any stickers?

391
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,200
I don't think I have any.

392
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,240
These are achievements.

393
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,200
Okay, they added achievements.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,339
What's this?

395
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:49,200
Start a parade.

396
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,779
Does this cost money?

397
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:59,539
That cost money?

398
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,069
I'll do it later.

399
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:01,910
All right, let's go.

400
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,420
I get it.

401
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,609
New customer.

402
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,609
Pink lemonade syrup.

403
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:11,309
Okay.

404
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:19,859
Sugar plum topping.

405
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,700
All right.

406
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,170
What do you got?

407
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,089
Medium.

408
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:25,930
Blended.

409
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,549
Strawberry.

410
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,009
Lemonade.

411
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,460
Whipped cream.

412
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,700
Magical.

413
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,150
Whatever fruit that is.

414
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,990
Okay, let's go.

415
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,920
I got it.

416
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:46,259
Let's do this quick.

417
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:47,099
Okay.

418
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:47,920
Go, blend it.

419
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,660
Anybody else?

420
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,500
Just you?

421
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,140
All right, good.

422
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,390
Oops.

423
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,880
Why is this taking so long?

424
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,720
Why is this taking so long?

425
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,619
This machine sucks.

426
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:06,460
Medium.

427
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,049
Blend.

428
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:08,869
Reese's banana.

429
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:09,880
Chocolate.

430
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,960
Chocolate.

431
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,779
Banana.

432
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:12,619
Banana.

433
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:14,089
Banana.

434
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:14,910
You got it.

435
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,750
All right.

436
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,589
Take us to the line.

437
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:18,859
Organize them.

438
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,700
Okay.

439
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,539
This thing's still going.

440
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:24,420
All right, all right, all right.

441
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,259
Keep going.

442
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,099
I want to get a good view of this.

443
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,569
How do I get a good view of this?

444
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,500
How do I get a good view of that?

445
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,019
There it is.

446
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:34,859
Okay.

447
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:37,460
Is this thing done?

448
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,299
All right.

449
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,319
What do you want?

450
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,140
You want Reese's.

451
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
You want banana.

452
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,329
And then.

453
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:45,430
Okay, good.

454
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,269
Put that on.

455
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:49,829
Take this one off.

456
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:57,349
You wanted whipped cream.

457
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:58,190
Okay.

458
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,839
And then you also wanted.

459
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,680
Is it plum?

460
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,109
Oops.

461
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:04,930
Okay.

462
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,769
That actually looks pretty good.

463
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:11,740
And then you want three cherries.

464
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,579
All right.

465
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,039
Let's go.

466
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:22,019
Take that.

467
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,289
All right.

468
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,130
I got to hurry up.

469
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,950
Anybody else?

470
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,079
Oh, shit.

471
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,920
Okay.

472
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,779
Is it a brownie?

473
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:30,619
Brownie.

474
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,420
What is that?

475
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,119
Okay.

476
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,029
Okay.

477
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,180
Brownie chunks.

478
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,019
What is this?

479
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:50,519
What is this moon?

480
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,359
All right.

481
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,779
You wanted chocolate with cream.

482
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,359
Coconut.

483
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,200
Coconut.

484
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,039
Where is it?

485
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,740
And then one Oreo.

486
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,700
Is this the right order?

487
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,539
Fuck.

488
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,819
This is the wrong order.

489
00:27:07,819 --> 00:27:08,660
Oh, shit.

490
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,500
How do I change this?

491
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:15,029
I fucked it up.

492
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:15,950
It's okay.

493
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,789
It's all right.

494
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:19,900
I fucked it up.

495
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,740
It's okay.

496
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,539
You still liked it.

497
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:24,539
You still gave me three dollar tip.

498
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,880
This one's wrong too then.

499
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,380
I got to throw this away.

500
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,220
All right.

501
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,970
Reese's.

502
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,809
And then.

503
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:46,970
Nana.

504
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,069
This customer is a closer.

505
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,269
They're very picky about their food.

506
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,549
They'll be tougher when grading.

507
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,420
I can handle it.

508
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,259
You're going to get fired?

509
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,079
I am.

510
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm going to be fine.

511
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,240
All right.

512
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,619
Really picky about their order.

513
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:06,779
How's that not perfect?

514
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,130
This one's still going.

515
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,430
Anybody else?

516
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,269
No, that's it.

517
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:16,619
All right.

518
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:17,460
So this one's coming off first.

519
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,640
So don't be stupid about this.

520
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,599
And this one is chocolate with cream.

521
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,940
Chocolate rocks.

522
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,039
And then three bananas.

523
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,940
Chocolate, chocolate, banana.

524
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,740
Banana.

525
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,039
Make one for yourself.

526
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:41,779
Cost money?

527
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:47,849
Does that cost money though?

528
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:48,690
All right.

529
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,220
Here we go.

530
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:55,200
Good.

531
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,640
They wanted these.

532
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,559
Chocolate.

533
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,400
Whatever.

534
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,240
What are these?

535
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,750
Chocolate.

536
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,589
Whatever there.

537
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:02,930
And then you wanted bananas.

538
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,549
Good.

539
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:08,390
Go.

540
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,210
There you are.

541
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,750
Sorry for the wait.

542
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,430
Let's get a ticket.

543
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,269
All right.

544
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:18,799
I see.

545
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,619
Oh shit.

546
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:20,460
Take that off.

547
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,299
All right.

548
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,140
This person's very picky about this.

549
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:28,380
So we want to make this perfect.

550
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,329
That's, it was close.

551
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:32,170
All right.

552
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:38,819
Then you want peanuts?

553
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:39,660
Shit!

554
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,119
How do I clean?

555
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,930
I would hate to hear that.

556
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,049
I would hate to hear that from the back.

557
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:46,890
Shit!

558
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:58,319
When they, you know they're working on your order.

559
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,430
What do you think?

560
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,250
Not bad.

561
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:14,099
All right.

562
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,200
I mean, we could have done better on the building.

563
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,630
That's for sure.

564
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,470
I got money though.

565
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm doing all right.

566
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:38,230
Rank two.

567
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,269
Chili works.

568
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:42,289
Okay.

569
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:43,650
Yeah.

570
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,470
Hold on.

571
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,309
Give me one second.

572
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,609
I have a very important thing

573
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:49,549
that I have to take care of very quickly.

574
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:50,390
Give me one second.

575
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,380
I'll be back in literally two minutes.

576
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,890
Quick BRB.

577
00:30:54,890 --> 00:33:43,940
Give me two seconds.

578
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,779
Okay.

579
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,539
Sorry.

580
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,339
Just had to do something very, very quickly.

581
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:52,230
We're good.

582
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,049
I told you I'm right back.

583
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:53,890
I'm right back.

584
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:59,069
We didn't go anywhere.

585
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:00,599
All right.

586
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,420
Here we go.

587
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:07,569
So this is Rico's Chili Works.

588
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,829
How does this one work?

589
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:10,670
Oh, great.

590
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,510
Okay.

591
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,559
Just connect everything and then do what?

592
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,400
Okay.

593
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,909
I got this.

594
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,750
Yeah.

595
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,789
Everyone's going to, oh, know me on this one.

596
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:28,750
But I, when they're not that difficult, I can get them.

597
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,730
Like this is not that bad.

598
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:37,280
I can handle this.

599
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,119
I can handle it.

600
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:48,519
Let's see.

601
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,110
Hold on.

602
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,639
Hold on.

603
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,860
Look.

604
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:02,780
See?

605
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,019
Payday in four days.

606
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,480
I get a hundred bucks.

607
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,269
Okay.

608
00:35:10,269 --> 00:35:12,230
I'm just going to put on every new piece of tire

609
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,920
that comes in.

610
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,530
Top and trim.

611
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,889
Countertop and wall trim.

612
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,480
Okay.

613
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,769
Oh, that's my counter.

614
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:38,909
I need, I need German 985 green.

615
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:46,840
There you go.

616
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:54,000
That's not green, but I support you.

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,840
What do you mean?

618
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:02,559
This is teal, like aqua, kind of green, coral, spearmint.

619
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,469
I don't know.

620
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,889
Yeah.

621
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:09,710
That's fine.

622
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,550
Should I do parade?

623
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,489
No, it probably costs money.

624
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:15,469
What is this shop?

625
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:19,090
Is that actual money or no?

626
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,599
New customer.

627
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,619
It's definitely not green.

628
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:33,260
That's definitely green.

629
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,079
All right.

630
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,280
Let's go.

631
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,340
What do you want?

632
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,000
Medium, blended, blueberry.

633
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,989
What flavor is this?

634
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,670
All right.

635
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,159
What is that flavor?

636
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,360
Moon flavor.

637
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,199
Yeah.

638
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:01,360
Well, what is moon flavor?

639
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,199
Wait, don't get me wrong.

640
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,019
It looks awesome.

641
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:05,829
I'd want to try it.

642
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,670
All right.

643
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,730
Just you.

644
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,570
That's good.

645
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,909
Want me to make one for myself?

646
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:12,230
I'll make one for myself.

647
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,070
All right.

648
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,889
If it were me right now,

649
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:17,239
I'm doing an Oreo cookie

650
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,320
and I don't know whatever this is.

651
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:30,190
I'm going to cream.

652
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,199
I'm going to get fired.

653
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,829
All right.

654
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,269
Oh, yep.

655
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,210
Special recipe.

656
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,590
They'll be tougher when grading their order,

657
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,929
but you can earn a new recipe to serve.

658
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,750
It's a tough recipe.

659
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,429
Why is this so tough?

660
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:50,269
Okay.

661
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,329
What do you want?

662
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:52,170
Shit.

663
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:52,989
Okay.

664
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:53,829
It's fine.

665
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:56,000
How is this so different?

666
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,940
Banana?

667
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,210
Come on.

668
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,030
That up.

669
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,929
This went off.

670
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:06,829
Perfect.

671
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:07,670
All right.

672
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,670
This looks good.

673
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,070
Good.

674
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,889
Okay.

675
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:15,730
And you also want,

676
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,969
you want blueberry sauce?

677
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,969
Oh, white chocolate.

678
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,730
Oh, you've ruined everything now.

679
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,329
This is ruined.

680
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:26,630
This is ruined.

681
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:34,559
Wait, what is that?

682
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,610
Okay.

683
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,449
Why did I make that?

684
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:42,570
I don't even want to give that to anybody.

685
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,329
I just made it for fun.

686
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:45,170
All right.

687
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,590
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

688
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,829
This one goes in the middle.

689
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,309
And then two of these.

690
00:38:54,659 --> 00:39:00,659
Go.

691
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,739
I like very plain ice cream orders.

692
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:04,579
I know that there's a lot of,

693
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,400
donut places.

694
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,940
Have you seen the donut places do this too?

695
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,780
I don't know.

696
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,599
I'm not in,

697
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,969
I just want it to be like,

698
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,849
give me like Oreo cookies in it,

699
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:15,530
or give me chocolate,

700
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,449
give me vanilla,

701
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:18,679
give me like banana.

702
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,500
I don't,

703
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,449
too many things in each order.

704
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:22,289
I like,

705
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:23,130
if you give me an ice cream,

706
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:33,480
I want it just to be that one thing that I want to taste.

707
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,679
That's pretty perfect.

708
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:39,360
Peanuts?

709
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,880
I don't like peanuts on anything really either.

710
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,929
I like eating peanuts by themselves.

711
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:54,840
Here you go.

712
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,309
Strawberry brownie.

713
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:07,250
Oh shit.

714
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,570
Is that an eggplant?

715
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,010
What is that?

716
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:19,599
You can get eggplant on ice cream?

717
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,519
All right, let's go.

718
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,500
Hurry up.

719
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,840
Strawberry.

720
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,780
Strawberry.

721
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,599
Get that on there.

722
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,280
Another one.

723
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,500
This one is,

724
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,480
cake and moon.

725
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:39,329
And moon.

726
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,570
Good.

727
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,409
Line that up.

728
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,239
Is that it?

729
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,079
Anybody else?

730
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:45,920
Yep.

731
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,760
All right.

732
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,579
This is,

733
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,409
this person's angry.

734
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:52,250
And I want sprinkles on it.

735
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,289
And I want cherries on it.

736
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:54,449
And I want cookies on it.

737
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,250
It's like, all right, come on.

738
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Relax.

739
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,880
I don't know how you order this angry.

740
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,719
Yeah.

741
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:09,639
And I'll take a large blended ice cream please.

742
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,920
And I want strawberry sprinkles on it.

743
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,159
And I want whipped cream on it.

744
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:12,980
And I want that,

745
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,239
the fancy little cookie thing on it too.

746
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,590
How do you order that angrily?

747
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,389
I feel like you can't order that angry.

748
00:41:21,389 --> 00:41:22,230
All right.

749
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,050
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

750
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,550
Stop talking and play the game.

751
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,750
Oh shit.

752
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,590
No, no, no, no, no.

753
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,409
I got time.

754
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:28,250
I got time.

755
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,090
What do you want?

756
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,750
Strawberries?

757
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,570
Shit.

758
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,260
Okay.

759
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,099
All right.

760
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,179
This is this one.

761
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:41,099
Uh-oh.

762
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:41,940
What do you want?

763
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,760
What do you want?

764
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,599
What do you want?

765
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,599
What do you want?

766
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,409
Chocolate?

767
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,250
Hey.

768
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,409
Quiet.

769
00:41:55,409 --> 00:42:06,920
Everybody stop talking.

770
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,760
All right.

771
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,579
Thank you.

772
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:09,420
I appreciate it.

773
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,260
I gotta go.

774
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,079
I have to take this one off now.

775
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:11,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

776
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,170
I gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

777
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,010
This one's overblended.

778
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,760
Fuck.

779
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,460
Overblended.

780
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,539
Ruined it.

781
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,380
Okay.

782
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,170
You want a coconut?

783
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,719
And then you wanted,

784
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,559
you want this other,

785
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,400
what is this?

786
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:41,650
Like Lucky Charms or something?

787
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:46,639
Go.

788
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,039
What is that a 60?

789
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,199
Oh, cause I overblended it.

790
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,039
All right.

791
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,349
This one has to be perfect.

792
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:06,380
And then this one is sprinkles.

793
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:14,530
Nice distribution.

794
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:20,599
There you go.

795
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,679
Overblended a little.

796
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,429
Oh no.

797
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:26,269
Well, I mean,

798
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:30,789
what is that purple thing?

799
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:31,630
Please help.

800
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,500
I don't know.

801
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:43,320
I thought it was an eggplant.

802
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,389
You're done.

803
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:48,469
Hop us raceway.

804
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,380
Sure.

805
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,199
Win the race.

806
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,420
Collect points to go faster.

807
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,199
How do you drive?

808
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,039
How do I drive?

809
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,480
I thought I was the person,

810
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,440
I thought I was the person at the bottom.

811
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,480
I don't know why I was,

812
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,840
I thought I was the person at the very bottom.

813
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,980
I would love to restart this.

814
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,820
All right.

815
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,659
Let me do that again.

816
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:21,960
Also, the frame rate of this game kind of hurts my head.

817
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,590
I gotta be very honest.

818
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:35,840
The road is kind of making my head hurt.

819
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,519
How am I supposed to collect the coins?

820
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:43,840
If they're in the way.

821
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,679
There we go.

822
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:55,489
All right.

823
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:56,309
We're good.

824
00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:07,570
I got new pants.

825
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:08,650
That's pretty cool.

826
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,469
All right.

827
00:45:09,469 --> 00:45:18,289
Good.

828
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:25,960
It's all mine now.

829
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
How was he playing this?

830
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,090
This is now on Steam.

831
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,730
This is the deluxe version of the game.

832
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,090
It's on Steam right now.

833
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,769
I guess they made some changes to it.

834
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:40,610
I don't know what they are.

835
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,429
I don't know.

836
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:42,269
I have no idea.

837
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:43,110
I can make a special.

838
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,280
Ooh, strawberry brownie.

839
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:52,159
Look at that.

840
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:53,000
Looks elaborate.

841
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,039
Okay.

842
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,039
I got some new stuff.

843
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,809
Did I get some?

844
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,610
What about shop?

845
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:09,230
I got 61 bucks.

846
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,309
Doorbell.

847
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,739
You'll hear when new customers enter.

848
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:17,199
Oh, that's helpful.

849
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:18,280
Customer coupon.

850
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,969
Send one to a specific customer to get them to visit again.

851
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:29,750
Lender booster?

852
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,429
Really?

853
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,269
Okay.

854
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,820
Well, I don't think I need any of these.

855
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,659
What about some of this?

856
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:40,230
I mean, this table is a must have.

857
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:47,320
Look at how tacky this is.

858
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,239
You know how annoying this would be to clean?

859
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,079
Because all the food,

860
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,719
all the syrup would just get in the crevices.

861
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:55,820
It'd be so annoying.

862
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,639
Ooh.

863
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:02,199
Hold on.

864
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,039
Get the doorbell.

865
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,280
The doorbell's way more important.

866
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,230
I guess it is only $4.

867
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,369
Thanksgiving.

868
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:17,380
Oh, look at this.

869
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,659
It's got marshmallows on it.

870
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:24,190
Midnight freeze.

871
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:27,869
Okay.

872
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:34,070
How do I do it?

873
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:39,889
Oh, that's good.

874
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:50,860
This gives me points, right?

875
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,780
Now, we gotta make sure the kids can see.

876
00:47:52,780 --> 00:48:04,559
We gotta make sure the kids can see.

877
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,900
Let's go.

878
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:12,389
I got my special selected.

879
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,659
Marshmallows are now available.

880
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,239
Mint syrup is now available for one person to order

881
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,929
every three days or every week.

882
00:48:23,929 --> 00:48:32,969
Can we hold in that bottle till expiration?

883
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:34,969
And I love, I like mint too.

884
00:48:34,969 --> 00:48:36,289
I like mint chocolate chip.

885
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,969
I like that flavor.

886
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:46,389
I'm just telling you.

887
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:51,150
Marshmallow, mint?

888
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,559
Marshmallow, mint.

889
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:02,880
I kind of feel like this is gonna be kind of good.

890
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,570
That sounds actually awesome.

891
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,639
Can I help you?

892
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:14,099
I want a strawberry brownie.

893
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:16,860
Okay.

894
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,159
What?

895
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:19,980
Oh, shit.

896
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,960
Okay.

897
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,880
Well, it's ice cream.

898
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,719
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

899
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:25,559
Okay, I got time.

900
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,039
What the hell's in this?

901
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:35,110
Chocolate, strawberries.

902
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,869
And then it's a bunch of other shit later.

903
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:43,260
Okay.

904
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:49,199
This is where I would just, I would start dancing.

905
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,119
Just kind of with my hands, moving back and forth,

906
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,500
smiling.

907
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,659
And then when they take their phone up,

908
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,380
no, no, no, no, no, no video or no photography at all.

909
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:06,809
Allowed.

910
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:07,650
Okay, okay, okay.

911
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:08,489
Okay, okay, go, go, go, go, go.

912
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,489
What am I doing?

913
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:19,380
I'm waiting.

914
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:37,349
Coconut and a cherry.

915
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:38,190
This is still good.

916
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,010
We're still good.

917
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:45,909
We're good, good, good, good, good.

918
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:46,809
He's talking about dancing behind

919
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:48,969
an imaginary ice cream counter.

920
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:50,070
I'm good.

921
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,530
A little bit overblended, but it's all right.

922
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,650
It's the special.

923
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,409
All right, then now we need

924
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:05,510
chocolate whipped cream, chocolate sauce.

925
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:12,039
Okay, now strawberry sauce.

926
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,119
Okay.

927
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,210
And then chocolate chips and cherries.

928
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,050
How many cherries?

929
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:29,679
Three.

930
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:38,380
73?

931
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:44,869
All right, I gotta do these quick.

932
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:45,909
This one's kind of elaborate.

933
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:50,039
I'm gonna do this one last.

934
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:52,000
Thank you for your patience, by the way.

935
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:01,829
We appreciate it.

936
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:04,320
What do you want?

937
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,760
Medium blueberry with whipped cream,

938
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,480
strawberry sauce, coconut, sprinkles.

939
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,320
This is kind of, oh, this is like too much.

940
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,559
That's a little too much.

941
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,179
I gotta put three of these up.

942
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:22,309
Blueberry, strawberry.

943
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,630
Blend that up.

944
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,960
Keep going.

945
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,119
Oh my God, I forget everything.

946
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,460
I forget everything that everybody ordered.

947
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,800
Which one have I not done?

948
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,079
This is blueberry, strawberry.

949
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,719
This one is blueberry, strawberry.

950
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,920
I haven't done this one.

951
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:40,769
Did I just do this one?

952
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:45,920
Did I just do that one?

953
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,679
I just did that one?

954
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,590
What's the one I haven't done?

955
00:52:51,590 --> 00:53:00,000
Blueberry and moon, okay.

956
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,480
Who's is this?

957
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,400
Oh shit, who's was that?

958
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,739
Is this one right?

959
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:07,980
Is this one right?

960
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:22,440
Yep.

961
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,239
Plant, cookie, banana.

962
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:29,389
Get it out.

963
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:30,710
This is a kids' game.

964
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:33,070
Papa's games are not kids' games.

965
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,469
They're incredibly stressful games

966
00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:38,070
that require a ton of work and time and work and thoughts.

967
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:41,090
Oh, this one's just sitting here.

968
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,889
Which one is this one?

969
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,570
This one is strawberry and this one, okay.

970
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,789
Somebody's gonna be pissed, but whatever.

971
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:53,599
It's all right, I fucked it up.

972
00:53:53,599 --> 00:54:03,329
It's all right, I fucked it up.

973
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:07,190
I gotta go, this looks like it melted

974
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,500
for like a half an hour.

975
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,820
This is why I always wanna eat one of these before,

976
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,900
you pull over, you park and you eat this.

977
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,019
Because if you just let it sit in the fucking tray,

978
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:19,579
in the cup holder, it turns into this

979
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:23,829
by the time you get back.

980
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:27,760
You pull over and you park and you eat it.

981
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,599
Serve it already.

982
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,590
I'm going as fast as I wanna go.

983
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:40,420
But fine, is it?

984
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,469
Oh, this is actually really long.

985
00:54:45,469 --> 00:54:47,170
You were here first.

986
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:56,199
Oh, fuck.

987
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,440
What are your thoughts on Horton, Here's a Who?

988
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,480
I don't think I ever saw that movie.

989
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,280
Just checking to see if you're still here.

990
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,119
It's a book.

991
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:17,960
Yeah, I know.

992
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,280
Promise that one is yours.

993
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,679
You can hear it right now.

994
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,159
I wanted to make sure it was fresh for you.

995
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:44,420
I wanted to make it fresh.

996
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:48,289
Working on it right now.

997
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:59,119
Hey, I just opened a fresh can of white chocolate for you.

998
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:00,519
These sprinkles?

999
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:03,039
Oh, these sprinkles, I don't wanna serve these to you.

1000
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:16,400
Let me open up a new thing of sprinkles for you.

1001
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,679
All right.

1002
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:27,059
Hey, by the way, thanks.

1003
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:36,030
That wasn't that bad.

1004
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,489
I will allow one comedy.

1005
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:41,079
I'm gonna allow one comedy order

1006
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:45,829
where we just give a person a cup of cherries or something.

1007
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:46,670
That's fine for me.

1008
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,510
We'll do it.

1009
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,349
Why am I?

1010
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:49,349
Why am I?

1011
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:58,400
Okay, I was like, what the hell?

1012
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,039
You guys ever want the actual tactic to do that?

1013
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:07,199
So always keep your mouse cursor right in the middle

1014
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,159
and don't shoot at any of the discs that come out

1015
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,380
until kind of close to the end.

1016
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,420
Don't do this.

1017
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,260
Stay right here.

1018
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,380
They're gonna cross the middle plane.

1019
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,579
You won't have to move very far from here

1020
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,309
to get most of them.

1021
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:33,820
You know what I'm saying?

1022
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,099
Why did you instinctively point that?

1023
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:35,940
I don't know.

1024
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,929
I just was like, shoot this thing.

1025
00:57:40,929 --> 00:57:42,369
Always make sure you come right back to the middle

1026
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:45,480
after every shot.

1027
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,239
I was distracted by you.

1028
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,429
Ooh, nutty buttercups.

1029
00:57:55,429 --> 00:58:02,650
All right.

1030
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,119
What is this?

1031
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:07,519
A carnival table?

1032
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,159
Should I make a bunch of obstacles

1033
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:12,570
so it takes them longer to get to the window?

1034
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:14,050
See, I think that's a big mistake.

1035
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:18,039
A lot of businesses that have lines,

1036
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:24,420
there should be a handful of those mall toy stands

1037
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,309
that have like the back flipping dog and shit.

1038
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:30,349
Just give people just shit to do.

1039
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:33,920
And put like kinetic sand samples over here.

1040
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,070
You know what I'm saying?

1041
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:47,230
And make that part of the line.

1042
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,599
Time to hire some help.

1043
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,800
Customers can now call to place orders for delivery.

1044
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,400
You need to hire a driver to deliver the food.

1045
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:32,130
All right, they can get delivery.

1046
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,050
Should we give them hair?

1047
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:38,010
Make Miku.

1048
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,570
Why do you guys want me to put Miku

1049
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,900
in every single video game?

1050
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:49,139
Do you understand?

1051
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,579
What does Miku's hair look like?

1052
00:59:50,579 --> 01:00:04,329
Why am I even entertaining this?

1053
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:11,429
Where is it?

1054
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:12,639
Like that?

1055
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,619
No, it's like that.

1056
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:16,579
Like that?

1057
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:25,079
Like that, I don't, like this?

1058
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,139
Like that?

1059
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:30,840
This one?

1060
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,670
This one.

1061
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:39,429
Oh, wait.

1062
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:44,480
What about the front?

1063
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,139
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1064
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:55,719
I got it, I got it.

1065
01:00:55,719 --> 01:01:02,730
This is close enough.

1066
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:34,780
Okay, and we need, okay, I guess.

1067
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:43,829
Correct, right?

1068
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:51,050
That looks fine.

1069
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,090
Can you change the eyebrow color?

1070
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:54,909
I don't think so.

1071
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:59,440
Different color, different color.

1072
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,360
Like that?

1073
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,199
What is closer?

1074
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,320
It's this one then, isn't it?

1075
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,159
Is it though?

1076
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:05,730
I feel like it's not.

1077
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,219
I don't, I feel like that's not correct.

1078
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:14,739
No, that's too green.

1079
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:18,679
Yeah, that's way too green.

1080
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:22,429
This one's definitely closer.

1081
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:26,349
Although maybe, it's between these two.

1082
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:27,989
This one's too blue and this one's too green,

1083
01:02:27,989 --> 01:02:31,719
but we have to live with one of these.

1084
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:39,039
I'm gonna keep this one.

1085
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:43,570
Pull up an image, I got one right here.

1086
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,250
In the mod chat, I got some help.

1087
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,960
Okay, this is fine.

1088
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:58,159
What about the neck?

1089
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:08,159
That's not correct either.

1090
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:16,130
Okay, it looks pretty good.

1091
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:27,599
Longer neck, longer neck.

1092
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,280
This is fine, this is fine.

1093
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
This is fine, this is fine.

1094
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:39,469
Okay, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.

1095
01:03:39,469 --> 01:03:43,190
Nevada, okay.

1096
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:56,519
Strawberry wafer, all right, let's go.

1097
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:01,710
Medium blended, blueberry, strawberry, strawberry.

1098
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,670
I have to keep, okay, I'm putting these in a line

1099
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,360
so I know that the first thing that I do is this one,

1100
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,710
every time.

1101
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:19,139
This is one in this descending order, strawberry.

1102
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:25,730
All right, who's next?

1103
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,679
I'm just gonna get one ready.

1104
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,210
Should I pre-make?

1105
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,789
Oh, hold on, hold on, telephone.

1106
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:35,110
Your driver will take orders from customers

1107
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:35,949
who call on the phone.

1108
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:38,840
They'll also deliver the food to their home when it's ready.

1109
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,280
Okay, you got it?

1110
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:51,800
Marshmallow mint, go.

1111
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,679
All right, this is the second order.

1112
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:54,880
Two is in this slot.

1113
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,639
Pico's working really hard.

1114
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:06,159
Yeah, no, we're good.

1115
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:08,639
All right, first one, I know I should do it the other way.

1116
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:10,519
Other way around.

1117
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:13,110
That's the plan.

1118
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:21,210
That's way more efficient, that helps way more.

1119
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,320
Let's go.

1120
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:28,760
All right, we need strawberry whipped cream.

1121
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:34,050
Coconut syrup.

1122
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:41,570
These, the strawberry wafers, that.

1123
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:54,280
This actually looks kind of good, just 100%.

1124
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,389
All right, come on, hurry up.

1125
01:05:57,389 --> 01:05:59,110
I actually would much prefer you just scream this to me

1126
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:08,400
when I'm in the back.

1127
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,239
Where's Marshmallow's?

1128
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:17,849
Oh, I got it, I got it.

1129
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,630
Hurry up, I'm gonna get that phone.

1130
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:24,809
Somebody get that phone.

1131
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:27,829
Somebody get that phone.

1132
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:32,110
You want to, okay.

1133
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,309
What the hell are you ordering?

1134
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:41,869
What was this?

1135
01:06:41,869 --> 01:06:49,280
You just walk in here in the sun?

1136
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,090
All right, I gotta hurry up.

1137
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,130
Get this off the screen, I can't see.

1138
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:58,050
Stop telling me that I'm playing poorly

1139
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,280
and just get off the screen.

1140
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,670
Get off the screen.

1141
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:10,110
Get off the screen.

1142
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:17,400
I don't want the help page.

1143
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,480
Throw this away.

1144
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,400
All right, what, I was in the middle of something.

1145
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,239
It's this one here, okay.

1146
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:30,630
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1147
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,769
What am I missing?

1148
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:45,010
Strawberry lemonade bullshit, all right.

1149
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,079
All right, sounds good.

1150
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,599
This one spinning, this one is this one.

1151
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,980
I need the strawberry brownie quickly.

1152
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,820
I don't even know how to make it,

1153
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:02,599
so I'm gonna do this one first.

1154
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:03,440
This one here.

1155
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,820
All right, strawberry brownie is brownie.

1156
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,000
No shit.

1157
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,289
Who would have thought?

1158
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:20,760
And then strawberry, shit, all right.

1159
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:28,859
All right, we're good.

1160
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:38,470
This is coming off first.

1161
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:46,270
Okay, we need this.

1162
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,670
I know people are mad that I didn't give anybody

1163
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:57,779
the strawberry syrup, but I know.

1164
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:03,880
Pretty happy.

1165
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,720
This is, which one is this?

1166
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,680
This one?

1167
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,800
All right, go, go, go, go, go, quick.

1168
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,199
I'll get all these out at the same time.

1169
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:15,229
Peanuts and then a cherry.

1170
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:16,270
Very easy order.

1171
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:23,060
Very easy, good.

1172
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:29,869
Almost perfect.

1173
01:09:29,869 --> 01:09:33,350
All right, now this is chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup.

1174
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,689
Wait, what's going on?

1175
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:49,119
Yep, good.

1176
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,640
Now the last bits are chocolate chips

1177
01:09:53,640 --> 01:10:04,310
and three cherries, perfectly placed.

1178
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,390
This is so much sugar.

1179
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:25,600
Yeah, this is like 4,000 calories.

1180
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,069
That's a lot of calories.

1181
01:10:29,069 --> 01:10:34,909
Marshmallow Pro, blender ball.

1182
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:35,949
There's a lot of these little mini games.

1183
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:43,060
I like these.

1184
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:47,159
Am I at max power?

1185
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:52,300
I just won the game.

1186
01:10:52,300 --> 01:11:11,770
Okay, what?

1187
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:19,729
Food truck free play.

1188
01:11:19,729 --> 01:11:31,369
Looks good.

1189
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:40,369
Is that the parade?

1190
01:11:40,369 --> 01:11:41,289
The food truck is the best shit

1191
01:11:41,289 --> 01:11:44,060
in the most recent mobile game.

1192
01:11:44,060 --> 01:12:00,310
I'll check it out.

1193
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,710
I left the parade.

1194
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:09,279
I got work to do.

1195
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:10,239
I haven't seen any stickers.

1196
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,210
All right, let's go.

1197
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:22,960
Oh, I wanted to do the free play.

1198
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,409
Wally.

1199
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,649
I'll take a medium blended blueberry

1200
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:29,890
with some strawberries,

1201
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:32,649
some whipped cream with the blue in it

1202
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:36,569
and then also would like some plum and some peanuts please.

1203
01:12:36,569 --> 01:12:51,939
Thank you.

1204
01:12:51,939 --> 01:13:00,000
That's it?

1205
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,649
I can sit right here.

1206
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:06,319
I look like I'm in a costume.

1207
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:07,920
Some days your dining room will be open

1208
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,760
and your driver will take orders from customers

1209
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,359
who are dining instead of delivering orders.

1210
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:14,600
Oh, they actually come sit down.

1211
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,500
Okay.

1212
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,340
Do you want Oreo cookie?

1213
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,380
All right, Oreos.

1214
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,029
How blended is this?

1215
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:24,890
I think we're good.

1216
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:27,460
Chocolate.

1217
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,470
Put that up there.

1218
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:31,069
How we doing?

1219
01:13:31,069 --> 01:13:37,720
Good.

1220
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,560
That one actually sounds pretty good.

1221
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:53,520
It does, yeah.

1222
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,079
Yeah, I'm taking it.

1223
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:02,420
Okay.

1224
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,020
This is still blending.

1225
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:04,859
Get this out of the way.

1226
01:14:04,859 --> 01:14:07,680
This one is the one I need to be focusing on.

1227
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
So we need...

1228
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,479
God damn it.

1229
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,729
Whatever, fine.

1230
01:14:15,729 --> 01:14:19,170
This looks good too.

1231
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,729
I can't remember the last time I actually had

1232
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:26,239
a wacky, wild-ass ice cream.

1233
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,689
I would consider this to be a wacky-ass ice cream.

1234
01:14:29,689 --> 01:14:31,409
There's a ton of different flavors and toppings

1235
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:40,930
and it's been a very long time.

1236
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:47,909
Things are definitely done by now.

1237
01:14:47,909 --> 01:14:52,380
All right, you wanted this.

1238
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:56,270
Chocolate.

1239
01:14:56,270 --> 01:15:00,430
White chocolate does get a pretty bad rap, doesn't it?

1240
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,909
I think it makes sense in some places,

1241
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:05,100
but I really just don't like it in a lot of places.

1242
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,460
How did I backtrack that before you guys

1243
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,220
even yelled at me about it?

1244
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,380
That was interesting.

1245
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:33,050
87% cake.

1246
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,909
All right, the hardest thing to make

1247
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:35,750
in the whole restaurant.

1248
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,670
Okay, let's go.

1249
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:39,510
I gotta memorize this.

1250
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,109
And then it's brownie, strawberry.

1251
01:15:46,649 --> 01:15:47,529
Another person just came in.

1252
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,409
All right, it's strawberry.

1253
01:15:49,409 --> 01:15:50,810
All right, all right, all right.

1254
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:54,520
What do you want?

1255
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,170
White chocolate is usually good for two bites.

1256
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:01,760
Yeah, it's fine.

1257
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:12,119
It's fine.

1258
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:22,760
All right, the system is working.

1259
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,720
Please make a funny drink.

1260
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,949
Okay, I'll make a funny one.

1261
01:16:29,949 --> 01:16:31,710
I wanna at least make enough money.

1262
01:16:44,119 --> 01:16:47,750
Cherry, and we're good.

1263
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:55,470
Now get out of here.

1264
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,609
Tropical treat?

1265
01:16:57,609 --> 01:16:59,050
Well, you took me too long

1266
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:02,470
for telling me about my new tropical treat.

1267
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:04,329
All right, what the hell is on this?

1268
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:07,439
It's this, too late.

1269
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,920
Then it's three brownie.

1270
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:24,399
Ah, it's even more bullshit.

1271
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:35,800
Come on, we're good.

1272
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,529
Take it off.

1273
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:42,739
Is there really a complaint though?

1274
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:45,500
My blended ice cream was blended too much.

1275
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:48,539
Doesn't it hit a point

1276
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,930
where it doesn't blend at all anymore?

1277
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:55,369
How would you even tell that?

1278
01:17:55,369 --> 01:18:03,090
It's just because it gets soupy?

1279
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:06,210
31%, you did one really unhappy.

1280
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:24,939
It's really soupy.

1281
01:18:24,939 --> 01:18:29,609
Don't overmix.

1282
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:31,770
I like these mini games.

1283
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:35,119
Slider escape, okay.

1284
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,680
Slide the burger slider towards the goal.

1285
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,680
Oh, it's one of these.

1286
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:46,170
If only it has to move the whole way into the wall.

1287
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:03,359
Got it.

1288
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:04,819
He's not gonna make it?

1289
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:20,159
Well, I already did.

1290
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:24,319
I got it.

1291
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,470
All right, I'm rank five.

1292
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,310
New special.

1293
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:30,319
All right, I wanna do the tropical treat.

1294
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:36,079
I would probably like this.

1295
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,890
Yeah, just put a bunch of shit everywhere.

1296
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:43,510
Stickers.

1297
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,989
You can now send your driver out in a food truck

1298
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:55,520
between work days to make any food you choose, okay?

1299
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,199
Customers won't place any orders at the food truck.

1300
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:01,390
Just make whatever you like and see who shows up to buy it.

1301
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,069
Oh, all right, let's go.

1302
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,430
I'm gonna make my favorite.

1303
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,789
This is exactly what I would be doing.

1304
01:20:06,829 --> 01:20:10,720
All right, bingo.

1305
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:26,859
Oreo, moon, not blended at all.

1306
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:28,939
Look at that, lightly blended.

1307
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:34,359
Still tons of chunks.

1308
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:37,600
And if it were me, I'm topping this

1309
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,319
with a little bit of regular whipped cream,

1310
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:41,270
just a tiny bit.

1311
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:45,829
Well, nevermind.

1312
01:20:45,829 --> 01:20:55,680
And then a little bit of chocolate at the end

1313
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,640
and really give him something to take a picture of.

1314
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,310
You know what I mean?

1315
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,189
Yeah, I'm the only guy in town

1316
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:09,430
that gives you a whole sleeve of Oreos as part of it.

1317
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:29,659
By the way, this shit's only fucking $4.

1318
01:21:29,699 --> 01:21:36,420
Holy shit, it's awesome.

1319
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:40,520
Okay, hold on.

1320
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:44,239
Can I change the flavor of ice cream?

1321
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,029
No, how about just plain?

1322
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:54,489
Oh, can I just do plain soft serve?

1323
01:21:54,489 --> 01:22:02,149
Marshmallow, marshmallow, banana, blend that.

1324
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:03,109
And you know what?

1325
01:22:03,109 --> 01:22:04,229
Check this out.

1326
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:08,520
Blend the fuck out of that.

1327
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,960
Oh, my mouth is already salivating.

1328
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:24,439
My mouth is watering.

1329
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:43,279
I wouldn't do anything else to this.

1330
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:48,909
Look at that.

1331
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:53,890
That was 100%.

1332
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,489
Don't have to make ice cream again.

1333
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:01,220
That would be amazing.

1334
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,579
All right, we have to make a Miku shake.

1335
01:23:02,579 --> 01:23:04,970
All right, we're gonna do blueberry.

1336
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:08,130
And then the moon sauce.

1337
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:14,579
We're gonna go right in the middle here.

1338
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:20,680
This Miku, whatever, Miku branded, okay.

1339
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:35,500
And then this, and then this.

1340
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,399
Look at that.

1341
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:48,859
And that's it.

1342
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:51,159
That's a full 100.

1343
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:53,260
Cool.

1344
01:23:53,260 --> 01:24:02,189
Okay, now let's do something dumb.

1345
01:24:02,189 --> 01:24:15,760
Cake, lemonade, lightly blended.

1346
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:22,880
And then strawberry whipped cream.

1347
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,800
I can't add any more strawberry, wait, I can.

1348
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,640
All right, no, I can't.

1349
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:36,109
And sprinkles.

1350
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:47,359
And this has to be a joke how much sprinkles are on it.

1351
01:24:47,359 --> 01:25:00,960
How many can you actually put?

1352
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:05,800
A lot?

1353
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:17,420
How much is a lot?

1354
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,359
Skip two hours?

1355
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:25,779
Vod watchers?

1356
01:25:25,779 --> 01:25:45,130
It's unlimited?

1357
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:45,970
I don't think this is,

1358
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:56,239
I think it's replacing them at some point.

1359
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:57,079
I don't even think it's,

1360
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:16,189
I think it's just kind of coloring over them.

1361
01:26:16,189 --> 01:26:21,359
What do you think?

1362
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:28,039
A little too much on the toppings, but that's all right.

1363
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:28,880
All right, last one.

1364
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:43,840
This is gonna be called the triple strawberry.

1365
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,539
Oh guys, we're making a triple strawberry.

1366
01:26:47,539 --> 01:27:25,180
Look.

1367
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,300
Okay, I need to,

1368
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:31,779
there needs to be like ace, king, king, ace, two.

1369
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:45,569
I want it to be like card themed or something.

1370
01:27:45,569 --> 01:27:49,659
That's fun.

1371
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:54,250
That would be a goofy ass shake.

1372
01:27:54,250 --> 01:28:00,170
Cool.

1373
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:02,069
It's payday.

1374
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:06,409
Go.

1375
01:28:06,409 --> 01:28:11,680
Large cup has been at, oh.

1376
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,590
That's my favorite dessert ever.

1377
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:19,170
People sleep on s'mores so much and it's infuriating to me.

1378
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,130
Like that is the greatest kind of dessert.

1379
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,289
It is, people just sleep on it.

1380
01:28:22,289 --> 01:28:30,149
It's like so hard to, you know, it's annoying to me.

1381
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:34,039
Okay, this is a large.

1382
01:28:34,039 --> 01:28:36,920
This is a large s'mores.

1383
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:50,220
Ooh, that's probably so good.

1384
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:53,069
S'mores are amazing.

1385
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:53,909
I mean, I get it.

1386
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:56,800
S'mores are a pain in the ass to make.

1387
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,250
They're kind of messy and they're kind of annoying,

1388
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,170
but I think they're the best dessert.

1389
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,359
One of the best at least.

1390
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,369
Especially fresh.

1391
01:29:07,369 --> 01:29:23,500
That is a medium.

1392
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:28,640
I made s'mores in my dorm room with a candle.

1393
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,119
Dude, you gotta be careful, man.

1394
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:32,239
With a candle?

1395
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:35,989
Come on.

1396
01:29:35,989 --> 01:29:37,270
Why?

1397
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:38,550
All right, wait, don't distract me.

1398
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,119
This is important.

1399
01:29:42,119 --> 01:29:43,000
I'll take your order in a second.

1400
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:53,800
We gotta do this one.

1401
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,640
Peanuts, all right, you lost me with the peanuts.

1402
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:14,520
Everything else here is perfect.

1403
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,359
S'mores.

1404
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:18,479
I gotta take an order here in a second,

1405
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,880
but I don't want it to overblend.

1406
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:27,050
Go ahead and do this.

1407
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:30,109
No, no, I honestly, peanuts.

1408
01:30:30,109 --> 01:30:32,189
I feel like that's very divided.

1409
01:30:32,189 --> 01:30:34,909
I think a lot of people really don't like

1410
01:30:34,909 --> 01:30:47,119
nuts on their dessert.

1411
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:48,119
You want a tropical treat.

1412
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,000
You want the hard shit.

1413
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,239
All right, hold on, I gotta,

1414
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,930
and this got all screwed up.

1415
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:59,270
Why did you move this?

1416
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:01,380
Blueberries?

1417
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,479
This looks kinda good.

1418
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:12,229
Blueberry cream is really good.

1419
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:14,630
Pecans are literally the only S tier ice cream topping.

1420
01:31:14,630 --> 01:31:27,479
I, no, no, I disagree.

1421
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:28,880
All right, what is this tropical treat?

1422
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,800
It's blueberry lemonade.

1423
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,319
Is this a large or a small?

1424
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:35,489
Medium.

1425
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:42,939
Blueberry lemonade.

1426
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:44,579
That thing up there, this is the tropical,

1427
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:49,439
I'm gonna separate these.

1428
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:57,250
Any nuts, really, I don't really like on ice cream.

1429
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:01,770
All right, this is a medium,

1430
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:11,239
rubber banana, good combo.

1431
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:13,199
I kinda did these two close to each other, I think,

1432
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,439
because I'm gonna mess it up.

1433
01:32:14,439 --> 01:32:21,970
But we'll try to get this one fast.

1434
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:30,470
So I need blue whipped cream, blue sauce,

1435
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:33,630
blue whipped cream, sauce,

1436
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:39,789
wait, wrong one, coconut sprinkles.

1437
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:47,630
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1438
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:59,460
So much shit on this one.

1439
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,810
All right, hurry up, hurry up.

1440
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:03,930
I'm wasting time.

1441
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:10,289
Uh-oh, um, uh-oh.

1442
01:33:10,289 --> 01:33:13,920
Oh shit, how do I, what just happened?

1443
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,399
Where's the other one?

1444
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:17,000
Which one is this?

1445
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Okay, I need this.

1446
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,779
Which one is this one?

1447
01:33:22,779 --> 01:33:29,880
What just happened?

1448
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:48,850
Okay, it's in the queue, all right, good.

1449
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:58,529
Pretty bad, but it's all right.

1450
01:33:58,529 --> 01:34:02,859
Good, it was an easy one.

1451
01:34:02,859 --> 01:34:10,359
Placement's pretty dog shit on that, but it's all right.

1452
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:13,399
What's my favorite topping?

1453
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:14,520
Is it weird that I can't answer that

1454
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,479
because I haven't had an ice cream like this

1455
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:18,970
in a very long time?

1456
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,220
I forgot what all this tastes like.

1457
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,600
I like blended up Oreo cookie.

1458
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,399
Cookies and cream is one of my favorites,

1459
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:33,729
but that's not really a topping.

1460
01:34:33,729 --> 01:34:38,039
Customer cravings, I got six tickets.

1461
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:39,920
What is it?

1462
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,430
I don't know, I think it's this one.

1463
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:46,470
I have to remember orders.

1464
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:52,699
Marty Grave.

1465
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:59,180
I don't know, we haven't even served him.

1466
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:06,760
This is a new item.

1467
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:16,680
Oh, I got a new flooring.

1468
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,699
It's Mitch Grave.

1469
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:23,250
I'm pretty sure it's this one.

1470
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:26,609
I think Mitch orders the blue whipped cream.

1471
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:32,880
I believe this is s'mores over here

1472
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,079
and this is Oreo cookie over here.

1473
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:44,279
I got this, okay.

1474
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,789
Yep, this is you like this and you want this.

1475
01:35:53,399 --> 01:35:56,899
There's usually a ton of stuff on, he's cheating?

1476
01:35:56,899 --> 01:35:58,699
There's not even enough time for you to tell me who did it.

1477
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:01,079
There's a delay on this to the stream.

1478
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:07,590
All right, you, it's, wait, who is this one?

1479
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:08,670
You want one of these.

1480
01:36:08,670 --> 01:36:10,069
I think it's this one here.

1481
01:36:12,409 --> 01:36:13,569
So I missed one.

1482
01:36:13,569 --> 01:36:52,130
Oh no, I got a bunch of new furniture.

1483
01:36:52,130 --> 01:37:07,149
This place fucking sucks.

1484
01:37:07,149 --> 01:37:29,010
I get points for these being here though.

1485
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,979
That's not as horrible.

1486
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,750
This thing is so ugly.

1487
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:37,359
I don't even know what to do with this.

1488
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:39,319
Maybe put this in the very beginning.

1489
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:41,439
It's like, oh look, checkpoint, you've made it into the,

1490
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,520
yeah, I could do some really, yeah.

1491
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,359
Oh, checkpoint, you made it into the restaurant.

1492
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:48,119
So here you are, you've made it.

1493
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:49,399
I think that's like a funny little cute thing

1494
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:53,770
to have at the front door.

1495
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:56,800
Checkpoint.

1496
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:04,359
They walk by it and it goes like,

1497
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:06,500
that should tide them over a little bit

1498
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,069
when they get to like the 50 person line

1499
01:38:09,069 --> 01:38:11,829
and they forget to have looked at the Yelp score

1500
01:38:11,829 --> 01:38:16,590
for this restaurant and it's like a two out of fucking five.

1501
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:18,350
Bring, bring, look, come on in.

1502
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:36,079
Why are you so patronizing?

1503
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:51,130
And why did I just go like this?

1504
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,529
I'm definitely getting older.

1505
01:38:52,529 --> 01:39:01,350
I just, and you know, I can just tell.

1506
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:03,350
I'm kind of getting old guy voice.

1507
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:04,189
I'm getting old.

1508
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:05,750
My voice is turning into an old guy voice.

1509
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,420
It just is.

1510
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:08,260
And I'm okay with it.

1511
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:10,760
I don't really don't care.

1512
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:23,800
Strawberry, where's, nope.

1513
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:28,920
Got permanent milk voice, kind of.

1514
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,239
Hi, you want medium?

1515
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:44,159
I am gonna wait to put this up here.

1516
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:49,760
Actually looks kinda good.

1517
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:58,699
Okay, now, now I'll put it up.

1518
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:01,319
Come on in.

1519
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:03,840
Why are you so patronizing?

1520
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,800
Bring, oh, welcome.

1521
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,560
Patronizing, who?

1522
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,520
There is a, who am I patronizing with that?

1523
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:16,840
I've never seen a like Mario checkpoint flag

1524
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,279
at the beginning of any restaurant.

1525
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:20,239
This is not a real place.

1526
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,279
All right, hold on.

1527
01:40:22,279 --> 01:40:23,119
What was it?

1528
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:28,069
This is large.

1529
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:29,810
Check the blend.

1530
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:31,489
This is why I fucking always gotta check

1531
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:33,890
the goddamn blend first before I do anything.

1532
01:40:51,909 --> 01:40:54,600
Hey, go, go, go, go, go.

1533
01:40:54,600 --> 01:41:01,680
No, that was wrong.

1534
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,220
You need a blend alarm.

1535
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,539
I need to focus.

1536
01:41:08,409 --> 01:41:12,340
I didn't even, why did I just do that?

1537
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:16,239
Take it off.

1538
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:21,430
What the hell do you want?

1539
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:29,739
Okay, and this.

1540
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:32,020
I gotta start styling it up a little more like that.

1541
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:34,859
That's like cool.

1542
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:37,010
Peanuts on the left.

1543
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:53,279
Dunk, I just blended a little too much.

1544
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:59,479
All right, this is a large and you wanted Reese's chocolate.

1545
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:02,930
Get this on a blender.

1546
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:04,329
We need a tropical treat.

1547
01:42:04,329 --> 01:42:07,010
Tropical treat, I believe is medium, right?

1548
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:09,949
Yep.

1549
01:42:09,949 --> 01:42:13,949
Food critic has arrived.

1550
01:42:13,949 --> 01:42:20,529
Okay, I don't care about anybody else's order.

1551
01:42:20,529 --> 01:42:21,369
This is a medium.

1552
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:27,229
No, wait, this is a test.

1553
01:42:27,229 --> 01:42:32,680
Sorry, sir, you're gonna have to wait.

1554
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,520
Oh, he waited.

1555
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,800
He's making me, there's another customer.

1556
01:42:37,939 --> 01:42:38,779
Strawberry.

1557
01:42:44,439 --> 01:42:47,670
Is this the critics?

1558
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:48,630
I'm gonna wait till this is ready,

1559
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:49,909
although I'll start to blend on this one.

1560
01:42:49,909 --> 01:42:53,760
It's a medium.

1561
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,260
Cake and chocolate.

1562
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:00,199
Perfect.

1563
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:01,529
Perfect.

1564
01:43:01,529 --> 01:43:04,630
Put it up there.

1565
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:15,500
Good.

1566
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,899
It's cookie, cherry, cookie.

1567
01:43:27,329 --> 01:43:28,479
Good.

1568
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:31,800
All right.

1569
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,319
All right, we still got plenty of time.

1570
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:38,840
First up is whipped cream, coconut sauce, sprinkles.

1571
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:46,020
Whipped cream, coconut sauce, lucky charms.

1572
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:48,970
Coconut sauce, lucky charms,

1573
01:43:48,970 --> 01:44:02,800
and then there's something else on it.

1574
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,640
Go.

1575
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:09,079
All right, perfect timing.

1576
01:44:09,079 --> 01:44:12,399
Good, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1577
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:13,239
No!

1578
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:20,699
Hey, hey, can you come back tomorrow?

1579
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:22,939
No, honestly, at this point, I'm sorry.

1580
01:44:22,939 --> 01:44:25,739
At this point, I have a stuffed squirrel in the back,

1581
01:44:25,739 --> 01:44:27,359
like a stuffed animal squirrel,

1582
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,119
and I just run out, holding it against my neck,

1583
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:33,399
like, God, just give me the squirrel,

1584
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:35,119
and I pump like fucking squirrel,

1585
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:39,800
like yippee, yippee, the sound effects through the PA.

1586
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:44,710
I'm sorry, you're gonna come back tomorrow.

1587
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,510
Gym carrier routine.

1588
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:48,789
Yeah, but I mean, at some point,

1589
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:52,970
I gotta check the business here.

1590
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:53,810
Make another one?

1591
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:55,130
He's been waiting for too long already.

1592
01:44:55,130 --> 01:45:07,289
No, I can't.

1593
01:45:07,289 --> 01:45:08,130
This is fine.

1594
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:13,060
It's a little blended, but who cares?

1595
01:45:13,060 --> 01:45:16,399
We got the blue ribbon, we're fine.

1596
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:18,000
But there would be a squirrel in your restaurant.

1597
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,010
Wouldn't that be worse?

1598
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:25,329
No, dude, you have to plan it.

1599
01:45:25,329 --> 01:45:27,050
So I have to come out to the,

1600
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:30,170
all right, I've gotta come out to the lobby,

1601
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:31,689
be like, oh, I'm just checking to make sure

1602
01:45:31,689 --> 01:45:33,409
everyone's doing all right.

1603
01:45:33,409 --> 01:45:35,689
God, it's a little stuffy in here.

1604
01:45:35,689 --> 01:45:37,970
And I open up one of the windows,

1605
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:41,319
like, and I have somebody throw

1606
01:45:41,319 --> 01:45:43,159
the stuffed animal squirrel through the window,

1607
01:45:43,159 --> 01:45:45,279
and I grab it, holding my neck with it,

1608
01:45:45,279 --> 01:46:05,550
and start running around the circle.

1609
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:19,770
Oh, let me 100% this real quick.

1610
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:21,810
That sounds like a Disney Channel sitcom.

1611
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:33,000
Are we sure that didn't happen on like Sweet Life on Deck?

1612
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,960
That may have, that may have happened.

1613
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:49,779
That actually might be a plot from that show.

1614
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:59,479
Shit, God damn, this is hard.

1615
01:46:59,479 --> 01:47:03,210
Ooh, I got a sticker.

1616
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:24,470
Ooh, did I actually get one?

1617
01:47:24,470 --> 01:47:26,390
All right, chunky alarm.

1618
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:33,060
Set this alarm for when Sundays are blended to chunky.

1619
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,939
Hold down the booster to blend Sundays faster.

1620
01:47:35,939 --> 01:47:39,569
That's kind of good.

1621
01:47:39,569 --> 01:47:40,890
I feel like it's this one,

1622
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:49,140
because most of them are coming through like this.

1623
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:53,170
Okay, and then maybe the first level of this,

1624
01:47:53,170 --> 01:48:01,430
I can speed it up, and then send one

1625
01:48:01,430 --> 01:48:08,560
to a specific customer to get them to visit again.

1626
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:16,670
Um, I'll get these two, why not?

1627
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:23,590
So I'm imagining those are just installed, right?

1628
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:27,260
Now celebrating Starlight Jubilee.

1629
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:37,529
New customer, boomer, pomegranate, mulberry medley?

1630
01:48:44,579 --> 01:48:46,060
You earned a blue ribbon for the next three days,

1631
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,380
customers will give better tips.

1632
01:48:47,380 --> 01:49:00,310
Ooh, all right, what even is that?

1633
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:02,279
This is medium.

1634
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:12,159
That's bad, throw it away quick.

1635
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:22,399
What if it's this thing?

1636
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:31,359
Hold down to boost button.

1637
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:32,840
Oreo cookie, strawberry, chocolate.

1638
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:42,279
That's, I guess it's not that bad.

1639
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:52,670
I have the alarm set, right?

1640
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,409
Tap a blend alarm, okay, yeah, there's the alarm.

1641
01:49:55,409 --> 01:50:11,560
Speed this up.

1642
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:14,199
All right, good.

1643
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:21,520
What is the max level in this game anyways?

1644
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,720
And then pomegranate shakes?

1645
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,159
Those pomegranate seeds?

1646
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,319
I would, on ice cream?

1647
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:42,760
I feel like that'd be kind of annoying.

1648
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:55,149
I can do it quick.

1649
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:59,680
Okay, you wanted this.

1650
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:07,600
Syrup on there, this on there.

1651
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:13,930
Chocolate chips, and then almost good.

1652
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:22,100
Max level's 100.

1653
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:27,100
They give extra tips today.

1654
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:31,279
It's almost 10 bucks.

1655
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:32,560
Do I have anything blending yet?

1656
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,399
What did you want?

1657
01:51:33,399 --> 01:51:37,050
All right, all right, we got two mediums.

1658
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:39,010
Get them up there.

1659
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:44,189
Want these, I don't even know what these are supposed to be.

1660
01:51:44,189 --> 01:51:55,859
Those are supposed to be like Mike and Ikes.

1661
01:51:55,859 --> 01:52:07,319
This is blueberry, strawberry.

1662
01:52:07,319 --> 01:52:08,600
Where's my comedy milkshake?

1663
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:17,260
Oh, you missed it, I did it in the food truck.

1664
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:20,279
The wrong syrup.

1665
01:52:20,279 --> 01:52:39,630
What, wrong?

1666
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:46,060
Yeah, I know, hold on.

1667
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:50,180
It's lemonade, not strawberry.

1668
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,779
Pink pomegranate, okay, cool.

1669
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:58,930
A large Reese's chocolate.

1670
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:04,920
This is not a bad one, this is easy.

1671
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,720
Okay, that's a tropical treat.

1672
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:07,560
I gotta hurry up with this one.

1673
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:15,909
So it's, oh, right, I screwed it up, it's fine.

1674
01:53:15,909 --> 01:53:21,079
Again, large.

1675
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:22,680
It's Reese's, it's Reese's.

1676
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:45,170
Oh, all right, banana cake.

1677
01:53:45,170 --> 01:53:50,779
Banana cake, strawberry.

1678
01:53:50,779 --> 01:53:55,960
How's that not perfect?

1679
01:53:55,960 --> 01:54:00,680
This is the tropical one, right?

1680
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,520
All right, what is this?

1681
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,600
Okay, it's whipped cream, coconut syrup,

1682
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:06,720
and then sprinkles.

1683
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,170
Good.

1684
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:23,819
They had to wait a long time, but it's all right.

1685
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:27,229
We should be fine.

1686
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:48,920
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

1687
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:54,640
Close as this one, all right, just get it off.

1688
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:55,479
Who's been waiting longer?

1689
01:54:55,479 --> 01:55:03,090
You have, okay, let's go.

1690
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:13,159
Oreo, carry Oreo.

1691
01:55:13,159 --> 01:55:16,340
That was a tuber reaction?

1692
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:27,220
Yeah, that's true.

1693
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:29,750
Nothing but just toppings, all right.

1694
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,409
Toppings, I hate that word.

1695
01:55:33,409 --> 01:55:38,039
Ooh, toppings, something about it.

1696
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:39,079
I just don't like it.

1697
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:03,149
Toppings.

1698
01:56:03,149 --> 01:56:04,350
Hey, those of you criticizing

1699
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:05,470
that I'm not playing the game right,

1700
01:56:05,470 --> 01:56:09,289
I've got a 98% service quality right now.

1701
01:56:09,810 --> 01:56:30,739
I'm doing pretty fine right now.

1702
01:56:30,739 --> 01:56:33,689
What's going on here?

1703
01:56:33,689 --> 01:56:34,930
What's going on here?

1704
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:37,470
Wait, I don't have to use them all?

1705
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:39,539
What's going on here?

1706
01:56:39,539 --> 01:56:55,159
I thought I had to use all the pieces.

1707
01:56:55,159 --> 01:56:56,600
What is actually going on right now?

1708
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:00,060
I'm confused, what does it want me to do?

1709
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:14,579
I don't understand.

1710
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:16,920
Wait, really?

1711
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:20,979
Wait, what's going on right now?

1712
01:57:20,979 --> 01:57:32,479
I have to, what the hell was that?

1713
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:33,720
Performance IQ.

1714
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,199
No, I didn't know what,

1715
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:37,720
they don't give you very much time to be like,

1716
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:41,539
oh, by the way, you have to connect everything.

1717
01:57:41,539 --> 01:57:47,659
Good luck.

1718
01:57:47,699 --> 01:57:50,560
Red clothing that matches the holiday.

1719
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,640
This dude is stoned.

1720
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,840
I am not stoned right now.

1721
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,890
I am fucking fine.

1722
01:57:56,890 --> 01:57:59,609
Oh, fucking, I'm gonna, no more swearing.

1723
01:57:59,609 --> 01:58:07,800
Check this out.

1724
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:10,119
Oh, there's this popsicle.

1725
01:58:10,119 --> 01:58:29,079
Oh, that's gross.

1726
01:58:29,079 --> 01:58:30,430
Medium.

1727
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:32,880
Wait, are we wearing the right clothes?

1728
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:38,420
Can we change?

1729
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:48,930
I can't change.

1730
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:55,649
And then go like this.

1731
01:58:55,649 --> 01:59:03,130
There, I just want a smoothie now.

1732
01:59:03,130 --> 01:59:12,960
Yeah, me too.

1733
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:18,180
This game just makes me want to go to Sonic.

1734
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:38,510
I feel like that's where you get stuff like this nowadays.

1735
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:40,109
All right, this one's almost there,

1736
01:59:40,109 --> 01:59:44,000
but I can take one order.

1737
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,840
Come on.

1738
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:51,039
Second order is wrong.

1739
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:51,880
What?

1740
01:59:51,880 --> 02:00:00,840
What's wrong with it?

1741
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:10,170
How did I do that?

1742
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:11,010
This thing is huge.

1743
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:16,460
S'mores, strawberry.

1744
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,439
This person's gonna shit their pants.

1745
02:00:18,439 --> 02:00:20,199
I'm not supposed to be swearing.

1746
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,439
Who cares?

1747
02:00:22,439 --> 02:00:30,539
What am I talking about?

1748
02:00:30,539 --> 02:00:34,050
All right, let me get back to this.

1749
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:36,529
This one is this one.

1750
02:00:36,529 --> 02:00:39,329
This one is, no, this one's this one.

1751
02:00:39,329 --> 02:00:42,130
This one, this one, this one.

1752
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:44,840
This has to speed up before I put anything else on.

1753
02:00:44,840 --> 02:01:00,119
Ow.

1754
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:02,899
Okay.

1755
02:01:02,899 --> 02:01:08,750
Blueberry.

1756
02:01:08,750 --> 02:01:10,819
Cookie.

1757
02:01:10,819 --> 02:01:19,949
Ooh.

1758
02:01:19,949 --> 02:01:20,789
Do a poll.

1759
02:01:20,789 --> 02:01:24,079
We should bet to see if you won't square for 30 minutes.

1760
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:25,279
Um, you can bet if you want.

1761
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:26,119
I'll try.

1762
02:01:26,119 --> 02:01:36,100
I actually will try.

1763
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,619
All right, should I make sure to tell this guy

1764
02:01:37,619 --> 02:01:39,279
that there's no returns?

1765
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:40,640
You know what I mean?

1766
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,720
Okay, I want you to want to understand

1767
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,560
you know what you're ordering.

1768
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,520
There are no returns or anything, right, dude?

1769
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:57,600
Like, just make sure this person's well aware of this.

1770
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,479
Look, this guy doesn't walk back in here in five minutes

1771
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:03,310
and go, hey, this thing was gross.

1772
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:05,859
Yeah, I know.

1773
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:17,590
This person's been waiting.

1774
02:02:17,590 --> 02:02:21,369
Just try to get the worst score ever.

1775
02:02:21,369 --> 02:02:22,210
Hold on.

1776
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:29,619
I gotta unlock stuff first before I do anything stupid.

1777
02:02:29,619 --> 02:02:32,779
This one is large.

1778
02:02:32,779 --> 02:02:36,310
Oh, throw it away.

1779
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:38,539
Throw it away.

1780
02:02:38,539 --> 02:02:53,800
Wasting time here.

1781
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:55,520
Oh, we got a Charborg raid.

1782
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,439
Charborg, thanks for the raid.

1783
02:02:57,439 --> 02:02:59,829
Welcome, everybody.

1784
02:02:59,829 --> 02:03:03,250
Charborg raid.

1785
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,689
Hold on.

1786
02:03:04,689 --> 02:03:06,449
Which one was this one?

1787
02:03:06,449 --> 02:03:07,369
I don't remember.

1788
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,520
This is this one.

1789
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,640
This is this one.

1790
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,760
And then this, I haven't done this one yet.

1791
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:19,989
All right, hold on, give me a second.

1792
02:03:19,989 --> 02:03:20,829
Hey, hey.

1793
02:03:20,829 --> 02:03:22,350
When Charborg plays this.

1794
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:24,350
Hey, we'll check and see how they do.

1795
02:03:24,350 --> 02:03:25,899
You know what I'm saying?

1796
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:29,149
Check and see how he does.

1797
02:03:29,149 --> 02:03:32,199
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

1798
02:03:32,199 --> 02:03:42,170
What is this one?

1799
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:46,399
Okay, good.

1800
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:47,479
I didn't swear.

1801
02:03:47,479 --> 02:03:49,449
No, I didn't.

1802
02:03:49,449 --> 02:03:50,289
What's happening?

1803
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:51,109
Oh my God.

1804
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,949
I thought that was the phone.

1805
02:03:51,949 --> 02:03:52,789
Oh shit.

1806
02:03:52,789 --> 02:03:56,810
All right, I have to pay attention right now.

1807
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:59,670
I already did that.

1808
02:03:59,670 --> 02:04:15,199
What is it?

1809
02:04:15,199 --> 02:04:16,039
What?

1810
02:04:16,039 --> 02:04:17,760
What did I do?

1811
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,319
Did I say something?

1812
02:04:19,319 --> 02:04:20,159
What?

1813
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:23,270
What did I say?

1814
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:27,090
Did I say something?

1815
02:04:27,090 --> 02:04:28,529
What did I say?

1816
02:04:28,529 --> 02:04:32,100
I don't even remember.

1817
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,500
Oops.

1818
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:42,439
Why would you ever trust me?

1819
02:04:42,439 --> 02:04:49,050
All right, you can trust me now.

1820
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:50,500
You can trust me.

1821
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:54,760
As of right now, for 30 minutes, I won't.

1822
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:58,489
I don't even know what this person ordered.

1823
02:04:58,489 --> 02:05:09,109
How is that not perfect?

1824
02:05:09,109 --> 02:05:25,569
I am hand cranky.

1825
02:05:25,569 --> 02:05:28,590
Oh hey, I'm gonna get the stuffed animal squirrel.

1826
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:38,199
I might need it in a second.

1827
02:05:38,199 --> 02:05:52,649
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave.

1828
02:05:52,649 --> 02:05:54,729
I just found that so, all right.

1829
02:05:54,729 --> 02:06:04,920
Wait, wrong.

1830
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,229
Not a bad day.

1831
02:06:07,229 --> 02:06:11,149
All right, timer starts now.

1832
02:06:11,149 --> 02:06:11,989
30 minutes from now.

1833
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:14,399
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

1834
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:17,960
There's not very many people that believe in me,

1835
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:21,890
but we'll just prove them all wrong right now.

1836
02:06:21,890 --> 02:06:23,930
I know that those of you that lost everything

1837
02:06:23,930 --> 02:06:26,989
on shrine bets in Breath of the Wild,

1838
02:06:26,989 --> 02:06:30,029
now is the time for you to make it all back.

1839
02:06:30,029 --> 02:06:31,869
I would have gone all in on yes,

1840
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:34,550
that I can not swear for 30 minutes.

1841
02:06:34,550 --> 02:06:37,479
I would have gone all in.

1842
02:06:37,479 --> 02:06:38,720
Believe in me this time.

1843
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,239
I have a question with the committee here

1844
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,760
that's gonna be judging this.

1845
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:58,359
If it's allowed on regular TV, is that allowed?

1846
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:06,390
No.

1847
02:07:08,829 --> 02:07:11,670
So, okay, where's the line then?

1848
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:15,779
Where's the line?

1849
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:20,319
If I were to say, oh, like a children's birthday party?

1850
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:21,239
Okay.

1851
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:22,079
So, what?

1852
02:07:22,079 --> 02:07:23,880
Oh, what the heck?

1853
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:25,479
Oh, dang it.

1854
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:31,840
That's okay, right?

1855
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,539
Those are okay.

1856
02:07:34,539 --> 02:07:36,619
Okay, so just pretend that I'm at

1857
02:07:36,619 --> 02:07:38,260
a children's birthday party.

1858
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:48,369
Okay.

1859
02:07:48,369 --> 02:07:50,289
It's almost similar right there.

1860
02:07:50,729 --> 02:08:03,119
Why did you get to be in the front?

1861
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:11,210
It's dangerous too.

1862
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:13,399
You have one dollar?

1863
02:08:13,399 --> 02:08:24,189
All right, I'm being it now.

1864
02:08:24,189 --> 02:08:33,289
We all can't collect the same coin.

1865
02:08:33,289 --> 02:08:34,130
Yeah, there it is.

1866
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:40,760
All right, we're good.

1867
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:44,989
Finally.

1868
02:08:44,989 --> 02:08:52,880
Ooh, what was that?

1869
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:53,720
Oh, cool.

1870
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:58,750
All right, keep that.

1871
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:03,130
Oh, don't I have to dress up as,

1872
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:05,409
we have to dress it in a certain outfit, don't we?

1873
02:09:05,409 --> 02:09:22,090
Does that matter?

1874
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:27,119
I don't think that matters.

1875
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:28,119
Is this a Facebook game?

1876
02:09:28,119 --> 02:09:32,539
This is a game on Steam.

1877
02:09:32,579 --> 02:09:34,180
You need to be the family-friendly version

1878
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:35,979
of Die Hard that airs on ABC.

1879
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:44,239
Okay, I can handle that.

1880
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:45,479
I mean, we've already talked about it,

1881
02:09:45,479 --> 02:09:52,369
but when they did that joke in Mr. Show,

1882
02:09:52,369 --> 02:09:53,689
Bob Odenkirk and,

1883
02:09:56,739 --> 02:09:59,520
why can I not think of his name?

1884
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:01,359
They were a comedy duo.

1885
02:10:01,359 --> 02:10:04,289
David Cross, yeah, there it is.

1886
02:10:04,289 --> 02:10:05,930
I'm gonna pause this because it's important.

1887
02:10:05,930 --> 02:10:08,489
They did that bit where it was kind of like

1888
02:10:08,489 --> 02:10:12,170
a Sopranos-like that was airing on regular,

1889
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:14,520
kind of just cable television.

1890
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:17,079
And it was, oh, whatever, the Sopranos parody,

1891
02:10:17,079 --> 02:10:20,319
whatever it is, brought to you with lots of,

1892
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:27,359
what, it's not paused?

1893
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:28,359
They need to do a bunch of edits,

1894
02:10:28,359 --> 02:10:30,640
so it was edited for television.

1895
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,689
And it's just so funny.

1896
02:10:32,689 --> 02:10:34,329
There's only like two minutes of footage

1897
02:10:34,329 --> 02:10:37,130
in like a 30-minute episode.

1898
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:39,090
Was it Mr. Show or Mad TV?

1899
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:40,170
That was Mad TV.

1900
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:41,750
That was Mr. Show?

1901
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:45,560
That was Mr. Show as well.

1902
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:46,600
Mad, it was Mr. Show.

1903
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,800
It was on Mr. Show first.

1904
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:54,609
Just wanna make sure you understand that.

1905
02:10:54,609 --> 02:10:56,130
Just in case, we just make sure this is really clear.

1906
02:10:56,130 --> 02:10:57,930
It was on Mr. Show first.

1907
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:01,119
Let's clear the air here.

1908
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:06,510
Oops.

1909
02:11:06,510 --> 02:11:07,390
They are waiting.

1910
02:11:07,390 --> 02:11:08,229
Cool, dude.

1911
02:11:08,229 --> 02:11:10,699
Whatever, cool story.

1912
02:11:10,699 --> 02:11:13,020
You're trying to get me to say a bad word

1913
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:30,640
and it's not gonna happen.

1914
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:31,800
These are both mediums, right?

1915
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:39,840
This is the large, did I get this right?

1916
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:41,800
Okay, this is the large.

1917
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,460
We've got two mediums.

1918
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:56,930
This one is Oreo and strawberry.

1919
02:11:56,930 --> 02:12:02,079
Same as well.

1920
02:12:02,079 --> 02:12:07,779
Holy smokes.

1921
02:12:07,779 --> 02:12:08,619
You're not winning.

1922
02:12:08,619 --> 02:12:10,060
I just wanna make sure you're aware of that.

1923
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:17,300
You're not going to win.

1924
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:18,140
I'm gonna make you,

1925
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:19,460
I'm gonna put you on the edge of your seat

1926
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:25,560
the whole entire 30 minutes.

1927
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:33,060
Strawberry, plum, pomegranate, whatever.

1928
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:34,220
I almost just got angry.

1929
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:36,140
I just have to not be mad at random stuff

1930
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:47,149
and I'll be fine.

1931
02:12:47,149 --> 02:12:49,409
Somebody at the counter.

1932
02:12:49,409 --> 02:13:04,189
I got it.

1933
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:05,880
Do I even have that?

1934
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:13,449
There's rocket whipped cream now?

1935
02:13:13,449 --> 02:13:15,850
There's rocket whipped cream?

1936
02:13:15,850 --> 02:13:34,960
What does this taste like?

1937
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:39,260
You got that wrong?

1938
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:42,460
You put so much stuff in there,

1939
02:13:42,460 --> 02:13:45,569
how would you even tell the difference?

1940
02:13:45,729 --> 02:13:49,340
I would like a tropical treat, please.

1941
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:52,500
All right, this is medium, medium, medium.

1942
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:57,260
The three mediums immediately.

1943
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:58,739
How long have you been listening to the same

1944
02:13:58,739 --> 02:14:03,500
Poppist Freezeria music?

1945
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:04,340
I mean, what are you?

1946
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:06,420
Are you telling me to turn this down

1947
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:10,539
and put on the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack?

1948
02:14:10,539 --> 02:14:11,380
Is that what you're asking?

1949
02:14:11,380 --> 02:14:22,640
Because that's what it sounds like.

1950
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,159
And then this is strawberry.

1951
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:32,920
Is that gross?

1952
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:34,000
That's kind of gross, isn't it?

1953
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:43,520
I don't care.

1954
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,909
Dude, do you even GAF?

1955
02:14:46,909 --> 02:14:50,630
Do I give, do I give a,

1956
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:54,039
is that what you're saying?

1957
02:14:54,039 --> 02:14:56,420
The medium.

1958
02:14:56,420 --> 02:14:57,659
And it is,

1959
02:15:06,979 --> 02:15:08,300
this one's not even on here yet.

1960
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:09,539
I gotta speed this up.

1961
02:15:09,539 --> 02:15:11,460
We'll do this one.

1962
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:13,220
And okay, this is medium.

1963
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:15,220
What is in this stuff?

1964
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:21,380
Oh, which one is this one?

1965
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:23,739
I'm, I'm, I'm actually,

1966
02:15:23,739 --> 02:15:26,500
I'm actually really messed up right now.

1967
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,460
I gotta slow down.

1968
02:15:27,460 --> 02:15:31,539
Just wait till these are put these in queue.

1969
02:15:31,539 --> 02:15:33,020
Do this one first.

1970
02:15:33,020 --> 02:15:34,659
That's not even right.

1971
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:38,449
What's even in here?

1972
02:15:38,449 --> 02:15:39,289
Is this this one?

1973
02:15:40,289 --> 02:15:44,279
I don't know which one this is.

1974
02:15:44,279 --> 02:15:46,170
I think this is the right one.

1975
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:47,010
No, what?

1976
02:15:47,010 --> 02:15:48,229
No, it's this one.

1977
02:15:48,229 --> 02:15:49,069
Whose is this?

1978
02:15:49,069 --> 02:15:49,909
This isn't, this isn't,

1979
02:15:49,909 --> 02:15:55,300
what is this?

1980
02:15:55,300 --> 02:16:02,550
I think it's this one.

1981
02:16:02,550 --> 02:16:11,800
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1982
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:17,319
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1983
02:16:17,319 --> 02:16:18,159
I just got, look,

1984
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:26,039
I have to just pay way more attention than I am right now.

1985
02:16:26,039 --> 02:16:28,640
It's this one.

1986
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:31,680
Somebody's been waiting for that tropical treat

1987
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,639
for a whole day.

1988
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:37,440
Okay, I got it.

1989
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:39,799
It's a medium, right?

1990
02:16:39,799 --> 02:16:40,639
Medium.

1991
02:16:40,639 --> 02:16:53,290
I have to get this going.

1992
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:58,250
Peanuts, chocolate chips.

1993
02:16:58,250 --> 02:17:00,370
There's so much stuff on here.

1994
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:04,510
You're not even gonna taste half of this.

1995
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:06,590
And you want a cookie,

1996
02:17:06,590 --> 02:17:07,709
and you want a cookie,

1997
02:17:07,709 --> 02:17:08,549
and you want to,

1998
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:16,000
you want all cookies.

1999
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:24,319
You want every cookie we have.

2000
02:17:24,319 --> 02:17:37,479
Strawberry, sprinkles,

2001
02:17:37,479 --> 02:17:38,319
and then,

2002
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:51,930
all right, I think we're fine.

2003
02:17:51,930 --> 02:17:52,770
Zero tip.

2004
02:17:52,770 --> 02:18:02,250
All right, I apologize.

2005
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:06,399
And then it's coconut, sprinkles.

2006
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:09,530
This one looks kind of good.

2007
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:18,739
It was going so well, too.

2008
02:18:18,739 --> 02:18:21,139
That really annoys me.

2009
02:18:31,409 --> 02:18:35,209
How is that wrong?

2010
02:18:35,209 --> 02:18:36,049
It was wrong?

2011
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:57,399
Okay, give me a sec.

2012
02:18:57,399 --> 02:19:03,120
Making a quick change here on the soundtrack.

2013
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,559
Get that Twinsons Odyssey up there.

2014
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:06,079
Why not?

2015
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:07,200
Let's live a little.

2016
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:22,500
42.

2017
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,739
What about Doom OST?

2018
02:19:25,600 --> 02:19:27,520
You're gonna have to wait.

2019
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:42,270
Let me get through this first.

2020
02:19:42,270 --> 02:19:47,030
Fingerless gloves?

2021
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:48,790
That feels, I don't know,

2022
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:53,069
fingerless gloves at a restaurant,

2023
02:19:53,069 --> 02:19:55,459
to me would almost be,

2024
02:19:55,459 --> 02:19:56,299
I don't know,

2025
02:19:56,299 --> 02:19:57,700
I saw someone with fingerless gloves.

2026
02:19:57,700 --> 02:19:58,540
They'd be like,

2027
02:19:58,540 --> 02:20:01,110
why are you wearing gloves in the first place?

2028
02:20:01,110 --> 02:20:06,100
Just don't even wear them.

2029
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:06,940
Right?

2030
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:24,030
I mean, the lore?

2031
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:31,159
It's about the look.

2032
02:20:31,159 --> 02:20:32,319
What does this mean?

2033
02:20:32,319 --> 02:20:36,739
You're built like the bottom of a table in Chili's.

2034
02:20:36,739 --> 02:20:37,780
I don't know what that means,

2035
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:40,139
but I don't know if that was like an insult or,

2036
02:20:40,139 --> 02:20:41,350
could have been.

2037
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:47,809
But what does that mean?

2038
02:20:47,809 --> 02:20:49,049
Oh my God, he is.

2039
02:20:49,450 --> 02:20:54,819
I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

2040
02:20:54,819 --> 02:21:01,120
Oh right, I was gonna do this.

2041
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:02,520
Get our own music in here.

2042
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:08,440
Not that the pop is music is bad or anything.

2043
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,280
Let's go.

2044
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:22,909
Let's go.

2045
02:21:22,909 --> 02:21:27,709
Should I buy something?

2046
02:21:27,709 --> 02:21:29,110
Pizza tower OST?

2047
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:29,950
We'll do that next.

2048
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:36,559
That sounds good to me.

2049
02:21:36,559 --> 02:21:42,319
Booster two?

2050
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:43,959
This is pretty good anti-swear music.

2051
02:21:43,959 --> 02:21:49,700
Yes, it is.

2052
02:21:49,700 --> 02:22:11,520
Why would I swear to this?

2053
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:17,719
Medium.

2054
02:22:17,719 --> 02:22:18,959
Hey, it's my birthday in a few months.

2055
02:22:18,959 --> 02:22:21,799
Can you swear right now for it?

2056
02:22:21,799 --> 02:22:26,299
You don't ask for a birthday present that far out.

2057
02:22:26,299 --> 02:22:35,090
That's a little too far out, I think.

2058
02:22:35,090 --> 02:22:58,250
I think within 30 days is reasonable though.

2059
02:22:58,250 --> 02:22:59,090
All right.

2060
02:22:59,090 --> 02:23:00,850
No more birthday stuff.

2061
02:23:00,850 --> 02:23:03,290
How much time do I have before I can speak?

2062
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:04,129
14 minutes?

2063
02:23:04,129 --> 02:23:07,840
Okay.

2064
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:08,659
I'm running right now.

2065
02:23:08,659 --> 02:23:09,500
All right.

2066
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:11,629
Let me get this out pretty quickly.

2067
02:23:11,629 --> 02:23:12,670
This is this one.

2068
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:34,479
Medium fudge brownie moon.

2069
02:23:34,479 --> 02:24:01,639
Ooh, this looks good.

2070
02:24:01,639 --> 02:24:02,479
All right.

2071
02:24:02,479 --> 02:24:05,610
Where's this ice cream that's gone?

2072
02:24:05,610 --> 02:24:09,030
Where's this ice cream?

2073
02:24:09,030 --> 02:24:10,709
What happened to the ice cream?

2074
02:24:10,709 --> 02:24:19,870
Oh, thank you.

2075
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:44,590
Goodness, it's easy.

2076
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:48,040
This one's pretty easy.

2077
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,559
Ah, now we slow it down a little bit.

2078
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:58,540
I like this part.

2079
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:02,079
You play with such a little urgency, it infuriates me.

2080
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:16,299
Um, how is this not urgency?

2081
02:25:16,299 --> 02:25:17,299
I'm being very urgent.

2082
02:25:17,299 --> 02:25:33,329
I'm just not effective.

2083
02:25:33,329 --> 02:25:36,010
Calypso Island coconuts.

2084
02:25:36,010 --> 02:25:46,760
What was that?

2085
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,469
That's a medium.

2086
02:25:51,469 --> 02:25:52,290
That's a volume.

2087
02:25:52,290 --> 02:25:54,200
Volume good?

2088
02:25:54,200 --> 02:25:56,379
See if I can do this one by just memory.

2089
02:25:56,379 --> 02:25:57,219
I believe it is.

2090
02:25:57,219 --> 02:25:58,040
I don't know.

2091
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:13,840
I can't do it.

2092
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:14,680
Okay.

2093
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:21,299
Lots of mediums.

2094
02:26:21,299 --> 02:26:22,120
Okay.

2095
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,200
Let's go.

2096
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,020
Medium.

2097
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:30,159
This is Oreo chocolate.

2098
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,059
Good.

2099
02:26:32,059 --> 02:26:32,899
Get it up there.

2100
02:26:32,899 --> 02:26:40,700
Alarm.

2101
02:26:40,700 --> 02:26:41,520
Good.

2102
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:42,360
Avoiding speaking is cheating.

2103
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:47,360
I've been talking this whole time.

2104
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:48,200
Okay.

2105
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:49,559
I need that.

2106
02:26:49,559 --> 02:26:50,399
What?

2107
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:59,090
What's going on?

2108
02:26:59,090 --> 02:27:07,190
Coconut syrup.

2109
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:14,100
How much time do I have?

2110
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:23,739
Music is ominous.

2111
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:32,180
Sorry.

2112
02:27:32,180 --> 02:27:55,709
Uh, um, okay.

2113
02:27:55,709 --> 02:27:58,680
Ooh.

2114
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:14,829
This one is white chocolate syrup and peanuts and cherry.

2115
02:28:16,989 --> 02:28:24,319
And then get the heck out of here.

2116
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:26,319
The music is too loud.

2117
02:28:35,959 --> 02:28:41,110
Peanuts.

2118
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:41,950
I can see this one.

2119
02:28:41,950 --> 02:28:54,120
This one looks pretty good.

2120
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:56,510
You should play Peglin.

2121
02:28:56,510 --> 02:29:02,309
That's actually been on the list for a long time.

2122
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:03,930
Peglin's been on the list.

2123
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:15,920
Just haven't played it.

2124
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:16,760
Blender ball.

2125
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:17,579
All right.

2126
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:23,139
Let me get this one right.

2127
02:29:23,139 --> 02:29:25,120
Is that not high enough?

2128
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:27,719
No, I got it.

2129
02:29:27,719 --> 02:29:39,969
The shoes.

2130
02:29:39,969 --> 02:29:40,809
Ooh.

2131
02:29:40,809 --> 02:29:41,629
Gold tile.

2132
02:29:41,629 --> 02:29:49,299
Let's check it out.

2133
02:29:49,299 --> 02:30:00,889
I almost just said a bad word.

2134
02:30:00,889 --> 02:30:07,219
Cool.

2135
02:30:07,219 --> 02:30:11,180
I like that.

2136
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:17,280
Everything's a little too ugly at the moment.

2137
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:21,920
That looks a lot better.

2138
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:27,239
Buying some money with replay.

2139
02:30:27,239 --> 02:30:29,950
Oh, let me change this.

2140
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:34,559
Let me change the special.

2141
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:35,399
Pink pomegranate.

2142
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:38,190
Let's try that.

2143
02:30:38,190 --> 02:30:39,030
Oh, what about this one?

2144
02:30:39,030 --> 02:30:46,889
This one's much less complicated.

2145
02:30:46,889 --> 02:30:54,440
Time, six minutes left.

2146
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:55,680
Star sprinkles.

2147
02:31:01,569 --> 02:31:03,250
What's the next infomercial stream?

2148
02:31:03,250 --> 02:31:05,250
Well, tomorrow we are watching 90s ads.

2149
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:15,799
So I think that's part of, kind of fills that, doesn't it?

2150
02:31:15,799 --> 02:31:16,920
Large, let's go.

2151
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:29,500
Strawberry chocolate.

2152
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:36,180
And then this is whipped cream plum star sprinkles.

2153
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:38,079
And the auto carrot is well tomorrow.

2154
02:31:38,120 --> 02:31:46,979
That's right.

2155
02:31:46,979 --> 02:31:49,659
It's more strawberry.

2156
02:31:49,659 --> 02:31:59,159
Large.

2157
02:31:59,159 --> 02:32:01,850
No, it's more first, right?

2158
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:03,659
Doesn't matter.

2159
02:32:03,659 --> 02:32:15,500
It does.

2160
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:16,319
This is the right one, right?

2161
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:26,040
Yeah.

2162
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:34,719
Those are cool.

2163
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:35,559
Okay.

2164
02:32:35,559 --> 02:32:36,379
How are we doing?

2165
02:32:36,379 --> 02:32:47,860
Did you swear or no, I didn't?

2166
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:52,020
When?

2167
02:32:52,020 --> 02:32:56,200
You're full of baloney.

2168
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:57,760
This one goes hard, by the way.

2169
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:17,020
I didn't say anything bad.

2170
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:17,860
What?

2171
02:33:20,219 --> 02:33:29,020
When did I say this word?

2172
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:35,969
You, I said, what?

2173
02:33:35,969 --> 02:33:36,809
We need a clip.

2174
02:33:36,809 --> 02:33:37,629
We need a clip.

2175
02:33:37,629 --> 02:33:42,520
I need a clip.

2176
02:33:42,520 --> 02:33:44,799
You're trying to get me to say that in chat.

2177
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:46,840
Cause you're trying to make me believe I already said it

2178
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:51,770
and I already lost.

2179
02:33:51,809 --> 02:33:53,209
Wait, you're confusing me.

2180
02:33:53,209 --> 02:33:54,370
Hold on.

2181
02:33:54,370 --> 02:33:56,920
Maybe two mediums.

2182
02:33:56,920 --> 02:34:13,059
That's large.

2183
02:34:13,059 --> 02:34:25,469
Cake and moon.

2184
02:34:25,469 --> 02:34:26,290
All right.

2185
02:34:26,290 --> 02:34:31,170
So what's happening here?

2186
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:32,190
90 seconds left.

2187
02:34:32,190 --> 02:34:33,030
Yeah.

2188
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:33,930
You, you made it up.

2189
02:34:33,930 --> 02:34:37,440
I don't say, hey, I don't see a single clip.

2190
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:38,520
I have not received the clip.

2191
02:34:38,520 --> 02:34:41,040
I have not received a single confirmation of this.

2192
02:34:53,299 --> 02:34:54,139
Oops.

2193
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:08,790
Don't replace what I was doing.

2194
02:35:18,659 --> 02:35:22,340
Somebody said, someone do something.

2195
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:26,920
I told you to believe you didn't want to.

2196
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:42,959
Someone do something.

2197
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:43,799
Okay.

2198
02:35:43,799 --> 02:35:47,000
Now where's this clip of me magically saying a bad word?

2199
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,549
Let me see it.

2200
02:35:49,549 --> 02:35:53,309
You got two waters left, huh?

2201
02:35:53,309 --> 02:35:54,149
10 seconds.

2202
02:35:59,190 --> 02:36:02,469
How do I make this?

2203
02:36:02,469 --> 02:36:03,790
This is, is it a medium?

2204
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:13,979
This is a medium, strawberry and two mediums anyways.

2205
02:36:13,979 --> 02:36:16,020
Well, I, I don't want to, I don't want to lose.

2206
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:29,579
I can't pause the game.

2207
02:36:29,579 --> 02:36:30,860
Cake and chocolate.

2208
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:32,930
Let's go.

2209
02:36:32,930 --> 02:36:33,770
All right.

2210
02:36:33,770 --> 02:36:34,590
So what, what is this?

2211
02:36:34,590 --> 02:36:35,530
This is the clip they keep linking,

2212
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:36,729
but I don't hear anything.

2213
02:36:36,729 --> 02:36:47,229
You only say baloney.

2214
02:36:47,229 --> 02:36:51,700
You're full of baloney.

2215
02:36:51,700 --> 02:36:54,200
This one goes hard by the way.

2216
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:56,600
I didn't say anything.

2217
02:36:56,600 --> 02:36:59,139
I think you guys are, I think you just a little salty

2218
02:36:59,139 --> 02:37:04,569
that you actually lost.

2219
02:37:04,569 --> 02:37:05,569
Believers win.

2220
02:37:05,569 --> 02:37:12,979
I think there's no hard evidence here.

2221
02:37:12,979 --> 02:37:13,819
Jermis's bad word.

2222
02:37:13,819 --> 02:37:21,659
Jermis's bad word.

2223
02:37:21,659 --> 02:37:24,620
No, there's no spurs.

2224
02:37:24,620 --> 02:37:29,159
We're good.

2225
02:37:29,159 --> 02:37:31,860
Wait, you're doing it again?

2226
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:37,819
Double or nothing?

2227
02:37:37,819 --> 02:37:38,780
No, I don't want to just,

2228
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:46,799
I don't want to not be able to say a swear for an hour.

2229
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:55,420
That's actually annoying.

2230
02:37:55,420 --> 02:38:00,290
And then it's pomegranate.

2231
02:38:00,290 --> 02:38:03,250
This one looks kind of tasty.

2232
02:38:03,250 --> 02:38:17,100
And then it's wafer cherry wafer.

2233
02:38:17,100 --> 02:38:21,899
Cool.

2234
02:38:21,899 --> 02:38:26,479
Right away.

2235
02:38:26,479 --> 02:38:43,309
How come there's no alarm on that one?

2236
02:38:43,309 --> 02:38:44,750
How come you can't swear for an hour?

2237
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:48,870
Are you five?

2238
02:38:48,870 --> 02:39:10,739
It was just a fucking experiment.

2239
02:39:10,739 --> 02:39:11,579
I was reading chat.

2240
02:39:11,579 --> 02:39:15,340
How did I, whatever.

2241
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:20,420
You're a paraffin charlatan.

2242
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:21,260
Delete your Twitch.

2243
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:40,170
What?

2244
02:39:40,170 --> 02:39:42,600
Here you go.

2245
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:52,840
What's coming up next on the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack?

2246
02:39:52,840 --> 02:40:16,629
Oh, good one.

2247
02:40:16,629 --> 02:40:23,079
Almost level nine?

2248
02:40:23,079 --> 02:40:50,909
Oh, yeah.

2249
02:40:50,909 --> 02:40:52,790
No, no, you're supposed to be bad at these.

2250
02:40:52,790 --> 02:41:20,969
You're supposed to be bad at these.

2251
02:41:20,969 --> 02:41:58,940
No, you're supposed to be bad at these.

2252
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:25,659
Just wear the same outfit.

2253
02:42:25,659 --> 02:42:26,500
What's the music?

2254
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:28,100
It's Twinsons Odyssey.

2255
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:35,450
Little Big Adventure 2.

2256
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:41,040
This is the longest I've ever played a Poppa's game for.

2257
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:51,069
Without a doubt.

2258
02:42:51,069 --> 02:42:52,639
That looks pretty good.

2259
02:42:52,639 --> 02:43:13,559
Get rid of the toppings and you got a believer out of me.

2260
02:43:13,559 --> 02:43:20,340
Can you play Ghostbusters, like the Ghostbusters music?

2261
02:43:20,340 --> 02:43:22,819
You know what I used to do all the time?

2262
02:43:22,819 --> 02:43:26,899
I used to listen to Ghostbusters theme song remixes.

2263
02:43:26,899 --> 02:43:27,940
It was like one of my favorite things.

2264
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:30,930
I would just listen to them.

2265
02:43:30,930 --> 02:43:32,739
If there's one thing,

2266
02:43:32,739 --> 02:43:36,180
the Ghostbusters theme song has like thousands

2267
02:43:36,180 --> 02:43:50,399
of unbelievable remixes.

2268
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:53,110
Oh fuck.

2269
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:55,950
Good thing nobody cares that I just said that.

2270
02:44:06,659 --> 02:44:26,500
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

2271
02:44:26,500 --> 02:44:27,340
What did I just do?

2272
02:44:27,340 --> 02:44:28,610
All right, we're fine.

2273
02:44:28,610 --> 02:44:29,750
Oh, should I put one on?

2274
02:44:29,750 --> 02:44:34,379
I think I'm gonna go find one.

2275
02:44:34,379 --> 02:44:43,870
How about Ghostbusters remix?

2276
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:45,270
This one's probably good.

2277
02:44:45,270 --> 02:44:55,500
Find out.

2278
02:44:55,500 --> 02:45:03,370
Oh, whoa, let's go.

2279
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:04,370
Did you fly us down?

2280
02:45:04,370 --> 02:45:19,959
What?

2281
02:45:19,959 --> 02:45:33,579
Whoa.

2282
02:45:33,579 --> 02:45:35,379
I'm saying, if there's a DJ doing this on stage,

2283
02:45:35,379 --> 02:45:37,299
I'm trying to take an order.

2284
02:45:37,299 --> 02:45:39,860
If a DJ was doing this on stage, I would be screaming.

2285
02:45:39,860 --> 02:45:42,940
I would be fucking screaming at this guy.

2286
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:44,420
Like, yeah!

2287
02:45:44,459 --> 02:45:46,700
Yeah, you're the fucking man!

2288
02:45:46,700 --> 02:45:47,899
Yeah!

2289
02:45:47,899 --> 02:45:49,180
Yes!

2290
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:50,020
Yes!

2291
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:58,739
I would be so pumped up about this.

2292
02:45:58,739 --> 02:46:09,149
You'd be able to hear me over the entire club.

2293
02:46:09,149 --> 02:46:11,069
This is wrong.

2294
02:46:11,069 --> 02:46:16,100
Good thing you, I don't even care.

2295
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:19,700
Wait, which one is this?

2296
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:33,059
Shit, sorry.

2297
02:46:33,059 --> 02:46:35,379
Dude, I'm gonna be dancing.

2298
02:46:35,379 --> 02:46:47,850
This is so bad.

2299
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:48,850
All right, that was pretty sick.

2300
02:46:48,850 --> 02:46:50,639
All right, so what else we got?

2301
02:46:50,639 --> 02:46:55,559
There's a ton of these.

2302
02:46:55,559 --> 02:47:00,600
What is this one?

2303
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:10,459
Ooh, sorry, I'm busy.

2304
02:47:10,459 --> 02:47:17,299
You guys need something?

2305
02:47:17,340 --> 02:47:58,629
Maybe don't even go faster.

2306
02:47:58,629 --> 02:47:59,469
Oh, that was cool.

2307
02:47:59,469 --> 02:48:01,319
What about another one?

2308
02:48:01,319 --> 02:48:02,399
Wait, let me finish this.

2309
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:09,899
This and then that.

2310
02:48:09,899 --> 02:48:13,059
Okay, the medium.

2311
02:48:13,059 --> 02:48:32,440
And pink pomegranate is strawberry and this sauce.

2312
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:45,149
Shoot, hold on, hold on.

2313
02:48:45,149 --> 02:48:46,510
People are begging for this.

2314
02:48:46,510 --> 02:48:47,950
Please, please, please.

2315
02:48:47,950 --> 02:48:49,229
We're begging, we're begging, we're begging,

2316
02:48:49,229 --> 02:48:52,540
we're begging, we're begging.

2317
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:53,459
Well, you're gonna have to wait a second

2318
02:48:53,459 --> 02:49:01,860
because we're way overdue on this.

2319
02:49:01,860 --> 02:49:05,270
I'll play it, just wait.

2320
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:06,750
I can't pause the workday.

2321
02:49:11,139 --> 02:49:14,559
Okay, this one is pink pomegranate.

2322
02:49:14,559 --> 02:49:16,959
This one, wait, what's going on?

2323
02:49:16,959 --> 02:49:18,280
Oh, it's this one.

2324
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:24,430
Okay, I just wanna smell this stuff.

2325
02:49:24,430 --> 02:49:35,840
I don't even wanna eat it.

2326
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:37,479
God damn it.

2327
02:49:37,479 --> 02:49:55,290
Okay, okay.

2328
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:58,739
I'm gonna play this for like a minute.

2329
02:49:58,739 --> 02:50:10,500
This whole stream's gonna get copyright claimed.

2330
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:27,319
Okay, this is classic.

2331
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:49,879
Can you please draw a butt with the sauce?

2332
02:50:49,879 --> 02:50:51,319
Oh, you're in a sea of people

2333
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:53,120
who are, you know what?

2334
02:50:53,120 --> 02:51:08,520
I'm gonna listen to that request.

2335
02:51:08,520 --> 02:51:52,049
This is the last one of the day, right?

2336
02:51:52,049 --> 02:52:03,040
Damn it.

2337
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:09,549
Oh, there's another layer?

2338
02:52:09,549 --> 02:52:10,750
Oh, I didn't draw a butt.

2339
02:52:14,860 --> 02:52:18,159
How do I do this?

2340
02:52:18,159 --> 02:52:19,159
I can't draw.

2341
02:52:22,559 --> 02:52:23,959
Whatever, they got extra sauce.

2342
02:52:23,959 --> 02:52:26,040
I can't even, you can't draw a butt, guys.

2343
02:52:32,049 --> 02:52:48,659
I can't, let's, all right, let's go.

2344
02:52:48,659 --> 02:52:54,579
How about, oh, how about Just Dance 2014?

2345
02:52:54,620 --> 02:52:57,139
Ghostbusters.

2346
02:52:57,979 --> 02:53:06,979
There's so many versions of this song.

2347
02:53:06,979 --> 02:53:16,459
This isn't Just Dance.

2348
02:53:16,459 --> 02:53:26,659
I think this is, oh, this is just a regular one.

2349
02:53:26,659 --> 02:53:30,879
Here's a dubstep remix.

2350
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:43,920
This one could be really good.

2351
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:57,559
I don't remember.

2352
02:53:57,559 --> 02:54:16,659
I think it's this, oops.

2353
02:54:16,659 --> 02:54:42,159
Oh, oh, hell yeah.

2354
02:54:42,159 --> 02:55:00,520
What is he like?

2355
02:55:00,520 --> 02:55:03,899
Awesome.

2356
02:55:03,899 --> 02:55:10,290
How about the epic version?

2357
02:55:10,290 --> 02:55:14,420
Ooh, epic version, like Joel's?

2358
02:55:14,420 --> 02:55:33,680
Okay, after the epic version.

2359
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:49,059
Dude, these are, they're all so different.

2360
02:55:49,059 --> 02:56:04,790
Here's another one.

2361
02:56:04,790 --> 02:56:12,000
The ghost, I ain't afraid of no ghost.

2362
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:22,889
He no afraid, I ain't afraid of the ghost.

2363
02:56:22,889 --> 02:56:30,639
There's more?

2364
02:56:30,639 --> 02:56:33,559
This one is pretty, this one fucking slaps.

2365
02:56:33,559 --> 02:56:46,540
There is no main fridge.

2366
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:47,899
Yeah, that was Joel.

2367
02:56:47,899 --> 02:56:50,040
That was Joel's version.

2368
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:54,239
There's no milk in my fridge, so I get pissed?

2369
02:56:54,239 --> 02:56:58,379
Ghostbusters.

2370
02:56:58,379 --> 02:57:13,260
What was this one?

2371
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:16,010
The game's frozen, right?

2372
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:17,860
That was fucking awesome.

2373
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:25,100
How about one more Ghostbusters theme remix,

2374
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:27,040
and I swear, have we done?

2375
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:30,469
I thought this video had over a billion views.

2376
02:57:30,469 --> 02:57:33,229
I was like, holy shit, I told you this was popular.

2377
02:57:33,229 --> 02:57:35,909
I thought this is over one billion views.

2378
02:57:35,909 --> 02:57:42,049
I was gonna say, some of those are me.

2379
02:57:42,049 --> 02:57:46,760
A billion.

2380
02:57:46,760 --> 02:57:51,420
Luigi's Mansion theme remix?

2381
02:57:51,420 --> 02:58:15,629
Woo, hold on.

2382
02:58:15,629 --> 02:58:23,389
Nice.

2383
02:58:23,389 --> 02:58:26,090
Ooh, new toppings.

2384
02:58:26,090 --> 02:58:30,100
Cupcake, is that like red velvet?

2385
02:58:30,100 --> 02:58:49,870
Oh, you only want a little spin.

2386
02:58:49,870 --> 02:58:51,149
Imagine calling an order here,

2387
02:58:51,149 --> 02:58:55,239
and you're hearing that in the background.

2388
02:58:55,239 --> 02:58:56,520
All right, I need to focus.

2389
02:59:19,540 --> 02:59:26,379
Ghostbusters theme on eight floppy drives.

2390
02:59:29,860 --> 02:59:44,780
Are you kidding me?

2391
02:59:44,780 --> 03:00:00,760
This is actually impressive, this is really impressive.

2392
03:00:00,760 --> 03:00:02,319
Someone explain to me how this person's room

2393
03:00:02,319 --> 03:00:06,659
is not smoking right now.

2394
03:00:06,659 --> 03:00:08,100
This one's large.

2395
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,780
Wait, can I still, I didn't even put this one to order.

2396
03:00:10,819 --> 03:00:13,700
This person's an order.

2397
03:00:13,700 --> 03:00:14,940
Whatever, let's do this.

2398
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:22,620
You want it regular, okay.

2399
03:00:22,620 --> 03:00:33,510
And what do you want, regular?

2400
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:38,110
Good, this is, they bolt this way, good, okay.

2401
03:00:38,110 --> 03:00:43,899
What do you want?

2402
03:00:43,899 --> 03:00:52,520
That's pretty cool.

2403
03:00:52,520 --> 03:00:57,059
Okay, I need to remember which one's which.

2404
03:00:57,059 --> 03:00:58,899
This one is this one, this one is that one,

2405
03:00:58,899 --> 03:01:01,270
and this one has not been done yet.

2406
03:01:01,270 --> 03:01:05,010
This one's a medium, let's go ahead and get that started.

2407
03:01:05,010 --> 03:01:10,409
Doesn't matter, it does matter, throw it away.

2408
03:01:10,409 --> 03:01:19,840
They have an envelope, and this one is medium as well.

2409
03:01:19,840 --> 03:01:26,420
All right, let's go.

2410
03:01:27,260 --> 03:01:30,520
Chocolate whipped cream, this game's fun.

2411
03:01:30,520 --> 03:01:32,440
I mean, it's the same kind of stuff over and over again,

2412
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:44,860
but it's fun.

2413
03:01:44,860 --> 03:01:48,690
Be overblended, not by very much.

2414
03:01:48,690 --> 03:01:50,149
All right, I gotta hurry up.

2415
03:01:50,149 --> 03:01:52,370
This thing's gonna be overblended.

2416
03:01:52,370 --> 03:01:53,409
No, we're good.

2417
03:01:53,409 --> 03:01:55,809
Okay, this one is this one, let's go.

2418
03:01:59,319 --> 03:02:16,180
Good, good, hurry up, hurry up.

2419
03:02:16,180 --> 03:02:19,180
Stop putting this shit in front of my order.

2420
03:02:19,180 --> 03:02:22,700
You idiots, I'm the only person that works here.

2421
03:02:22,739 --> 03:02:45,840
Okay, this is a medium, and this looks good.

2422
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:50,879
Some pomegranate on there, cool.

2423
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:55,809
All right, it matters where you put the cookies

2424
03:02:55,809 --> 03:03:03,889
and the fruit, yeah, I know, but I've very, ooh.

2425
03:03:05,799 --> 03:03:07,590
Is that spinning?

2426
03:03:07,590 --> 03:03:19,430
Wait, this is a critic, this has to be good.

2427
03:03:19,430 --> 03:03:27,540
Let's get this one out first, that's right, right?

2428
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:33,000
Yep, all right, it was a large, good.

2429
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,440
Brownie, everything has to be perfect.

2430
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:39,760
I'm gonna try as hard as I can on this one, good.

2431
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:42,780
Throw it away, no, throw it away, it's not good enough.

2432
03:03:42,819 --> 03:03:44,540
Gordon Ramsay is here right now.

2433
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:48,040
That wasn't perfect, throw it away.

2434
03:03:48,040 --> 03:03:59,209
Why is it not perfect?

2435
03:03:59,209 --> 03:04:06,489
Okay, you wanna blend it all the way?

2436
03:04:06,489 --> 03:04:17,340
Play two trucks, oh my God, hold on, hold on a second.

2437
03:04:17,340 --> 03:04:32,180
Is strawberry whipped cream, strawberry sauce, pomegranate.

2438
03:04:32,180 --> 03:04:53,219
Pomegranate, and then it's wafer, cherry wafer, yep.

2439
03:04:53,219 --> 03:04:56,540
That was a good one.

2440
03:04:56,540 --> 03:05:01,819
This one has to be perfect, remember?

2441
03:05:01,819 --> 03:05:16,020
All right, let's go, that's pretty close to being perfect.

2442
03:05:16,020 --> 03:05:41,110
Fuck, actually, that was really loud, I'm sorry.

2443
03:05:41,110 --> 03:05:47,250
That's good enough.

2444
03:05:48,209 --> 03:05:51,850
Oh yeah, pizza tower.

2445
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:53,549
Yeah!

2446
03:05:53,549 --> 03:06:06,360
Pizza tower, OST.

2447
03:06:06,360 --> 03:06:09,639
Yeah!

2448
03:06:09,639 --> 03:06:16,989
Two trucks, two trucks, you're good.

2449
03:06:16,989 --> 03:06:20,610
I'll do it after this.

2450
03:06:20,610 --> 03:06:24,219
I've been playing this game for three hours, how?

2451
03:06:24,219 --> 03:06:57,059
I'm just gonna chill in this school, all right.

2452
03:06:57,059 --> 03:07:03,260
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

2453
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:19,110
Ooh, lime.

2454
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:23,899
Yeah!

2455
03:07:23,899 --> 03:07:40,940
Ooh, a cat, can I get them all?

2456
03:07:40,940 --> 03:07:51,350
Yes!

2457
03:07:51,350 --> 03:08:07,559
All right, this outfit's gotta go, okay.

2458
03:08:07,559 --> 03:08:19,370
Jacket or no jacket?

2459
03:08:19,370 --> 03:08:27,239
Gum balls, chocolate syrup balls?

2460
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:31,290
This matches the holiday, double points, ooh.

2461
03:08:31,290 --> 03:08:38,770
Really?

2462
03:08:38,770 --> 03:08:40,530
You ever gonna P-rank any of these levels?

2463
03:08:40,530 --> 03:08:42,870
No, no way.

2464
03:08:42,870 --> 03:08:45,989
I can just enjoy the fact that I loved this game.

2465
03:08:45,989 --> 03:08:51,139
It was very good, and that's it.

2466
03:08:51,139 --> 03:08:53,979
All right, I get double points.

2467
03:08:53,979 --> 03:08:59,010
Do two trucks, all right, I will, what, two trucks.

2468
03:08:59,010 --> 03:09:14,500
I will play your song, Two Trucks.

2469
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:20,149
Two Trucks is about two trucks having sex.

2470
03:09:20,149 --> 03:09:26,309
Oh, is it not?

2471
03:09:26,309 --> 03:09:28,389
Two trucks having sex.

2472
03:09:28,389 --> 03:09:30,149
Two trucks having sex.

2473
03:09:30,149 --> 03:09:30,989
It is.

2474
03:09:30,989 --> 03:09:34,709
My muscles, my muscles involuntarily flex.

2475
03:09:34,709 --> 03:09:36,790
Two trucks having sex.

2476
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:38,870
Two trucks having sex.

2477
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:43,110
My muscles, my muscles involuntarily flex.

2478
03:09:43,110 --> 03:09:49,420
Two bigger trucks making love.

2479
03:09:49,420 --> 03:10:04,250
I screwed this up, hold on.

2480
03:10:04,250 --> 03:10:11,139
Anybody else?

2481
03:10:11,139 --> 03:10:18,680
That's pretty fucking sick.

2482
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:19,639
We're back on?

2483
03:10:19,639 --> 03:10:25,239
We're just jumping around, we're shuffling around.

2484
03:10:25,959 --> 03:10:26,799
Two huge trucks.

2485
03:10:30,159 --> 03:10:31,920
Finish that song now.

2486
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:39,780
Two trucks having sex.

2487
03:10:39,780 --> 03:10:58,559
I'm wasting time, okay.

2488
03:10:58,559 --> 03:11:09,639
Nope, any more?

2489
03:11:09,639 --> 03:11:10,840
Nope, beat this one up.

2490
03:11:24,059 --> 03:11:39,540
This one's very easy, it's a pretty good drizzle.

2491
03:11:39,540 --> 03:11:48,500
Nice.

2492
03:11:48,500 --> 03:11:50,260
Welcome new viewers.

2493
03:11:50,260 --> 03:11:51,100
Yeah, hi.

2494
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:53,979
Are there new viewers here?

2495
03:11:53,979 --> 03:11:56,940
Two trucks.

2496
03:11:56,940 --> 03:11:59,059
The weird thing is that I'm a new viewer too.

2497
03:11:59,059 --> 03:12:01,100
Two trucks having sex.

2498
03:12:01,100 --> 03:12:01,940
Whatever.

2499
03:12:01,940 --> 03:12:05,280
Two trucks having sex.

2500
03:12:06,280 --> 03:12:07,360
This is a large, right?

2501
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:16,889
Yeah.

2502
03:12:16,889 --> 03:12:20,790
Peanuts.

2503
03:12:20,790 --> 03:12:28,319
Good drizzle, good drizzle.

2504
03:12:28,319 --> 03:12:33,530
Pretty damn good drizzle.

2505
03:12:33,530 --> 03:12:34,450
That's a perfect.

2506
03:12:46,709 --> 03:12:48,420
Sick, all right.

2507
03:12:48,420 --> 03:12:52,860
That's a funny song.

2508
03:12:52,860 --> 03:12:57,620
It's a classic.

2509
03:12:57,620 --> 03:13:01,450
I want the pizza tower time song.

2510
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:13,020
Where is it?

2511
03:13:13,020 --> 03:13:17,430
What's it called?

2512
03:13:17,430 --> 03:13:27,979
This is it, right?

2513
03:13:27,979 --> 03:14:01,530
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

2514
03:14:01,530 --> 03:14:05,829
This is one of the best soundtracks I think I've ever heard.

2515
03:14:05,829 --> 03:14:07,270
I think it just is.

2516
03:14:07,270 --> 03:14:08,989
I really think this is probably one of the best soundtracks

2517
03:14:08,989 --> 03:14:11,270
in any video game that's ever released.

2518
03:14:11,270 --> 03:14:12,110
That's true.

2519
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:16,559
Every single song is fantastic.

2520
03:14:16,559 --> 03:14:23,770
I don't think this one's not good.

2521
03:14:23,770 --> 03:14:25,209
I got these flips by the way.

2522
03:14:51,989 --> 03:14:53,909
Is this, this is a different version though.

2523
03:14:53,909 --> 03:14:56,979
Where's the other version?

2524
03:14:56,979 --> 03:15:07,930
Where does it go into that version?

2525
03:15:07,930 --> 03:15:13,049
You got the other one in mod chat?

2526
03:15:13,049 --> 03:15:14,010
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

2527
03:15:14,010 --> 03:15:15,090
This is it, this is it, let's go.

2528
03:15:15,090 --> 03:15:27,229
This is the one.

2529
03:15:27,229 --> 03:15:37,079
All right, we're gonna do this one here.

2530
03:15:37,079 --> 03:15:40,780
Medium.

2531
03:15:40,780 --> 03:15:48,090
Go faster, I'm trying.

2532
03:15:48,090 --> 03:15:50,049
Is this making me need to poop?

2533
03:15:50,049 --> 03:15:52,959
Well, that's, is that a bad thing?

2534
03:15:52,959 --> 03:15:55,479
It might be, it's making you more regular?

2535
03:15:55,479 --> 03:15:56,319
I don't know.

2536
03:15:56,319 --> 03:16:32,450
It's a medium, right?

2537
03:16:32,450 --> 03:16:46,440
Both chunky.

2538
03:16:46,440 --> 03:16:49,670
Go.

2539
03:16:49,670 --> 03:16:56,420
That placement was awful.

2540
03:16:56,420 --> 03:16:59,659
Did I get the order wrong?

2541
03:16:59,659 --> 03:17:12,870
No, I didn't.

2542
03:17:12,870 --> 03:17:29,969
Shoot.

2543
03:17:29,969 --> 03:17:34,350
Uh-oh.

2544
03:17:34,350 --> 03:17:36,069
Go, go, go, hurry up.

2545
03:17:36,069 --> 03:17:40,600
What?

2546
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:41,440
What is this?

2547
03:17:41,440 --> 03:17:45,959
This is the wrong, why is there another one?

2548
03:17:45,959 --> 03:17:47,280
Who is this?

2549
03:17:47,280 --> 03:18:00,639
I'm going too fast.

2550
03:18:00,639 --> 03:18:14,219
Hurry, hurry before he, I'm going, I'm going.

2551
03:18:14,219 --> 03:18:52,360
Ah!

2552
03:18:52,360 --> 03:19:11,579
Okay.

2553
03:19:11,579 --> 03:19:17,030
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.

2554
03:19:17,030 --> 03:19:18,620
Sorry.

2555
03:19:20,620 --> 03:19:35,459
I'm a fucking porky pig over here.

2556
03:19:35,459 --> 03:19:38,450
But you just don't have to use any of this shit.

2557
03:19:38,450 --> 03:19:40,909
No!

2558
03:19:40,909 --> 03:19:55,889
I don't like these, it's fine.

2559
03:19:55,889 --> 03:19:59,100
Is that gonna do it?

2560
03:19:59,100 --> 03:20:01,700
I had it and it was gone, it was there.

2561
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,540
And I just, I, you know what?

2562
03:20:03,540 --> 03:20:21,549
Let's fucking get funky.

2563
03:20:21,549 --> 03:20:23,340
What's this one?

2564
03:20:24,340 --> 03:20:27,670
That's a good one too.

2565
03:20:38,309 --> 03:20:43,700
That's a good one.

2566
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:46,290
All right, after this order, after this day,

2567
03:20:46,290 --> 03:20:49,739
I'm gonna take a quick VRB.

2568
03:20:49,739 --> 03:20:54,319
We'll come back and we'll decide what's gonna happen then.

2569
03:20:54,319 --> 03:20:57,659
I'm kind of just enjoying hanging out and playing this.

2570
03:20:57,659 --> 03:21:04,459
I got another game I could move to, but we'll see.

2571
03:21:04,459 --> 03:21:07,020
I will tell you the time tomorrow.

2572
03:21:07,020 --> 03:21:11,579
The 90s commercials stream is going to be tomorrow afternoon.

2573
03:21:11,579 --> 03:21:14,280
It's not gonna be six o'clock.

2574
03:21:14,280 --> 03:21:18,379
I'm gonna start a little bit earlier.

2575
03:21:18,379 --> 03:21:24,590
Cause I know that, okay.

2576
03:21:24,590 --> 03:21:26,870
So do you use a grand charm that adds 11 to defense?

2577
03:21:26,870 --> 03:21:28,110
Oh no, not throw that away.

2578
03:21:28,110 --> 03:21:30,100
Sell that immediately.

2579
03:21:30,100 --> 03:21:31,299
Grand charm, 11 defense?

2580
03:21:31,299 --> 03:21:39,319
That's, no, that's not good.

2581
03:21:39,319 --> 03:21:42,799
You're looking for plus skills or resistance small charms

2582
03:21:42,799 --> 03:21:46,430
or plus a bunch to life small charms?

2583
03:21:46,430 --> 03:21:53,420
Just trying to help somebody out.

2584
03:21:53,420 --> 03:21:55,409
These are both largest, okay.

2585
03:21:55,409 --> 03:21:58,500
And what is in this one?

2586
03:21:58,500 --> 03:21:59,340
That's that one.

2587
03:21:59,340 --> 03:22:00,700
All right, this one is this.

2588
03:22:15,659 --> 03:22:17,340
What time tomorrow?

2589
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:20,620
Probably around, somewhere around three or four Pacific.

2590
03:22:20,620 --> 03:22:22,870
Not six.

2591
03:22:22,870 --> 03:22:26,409
I'm gonna shoot for 4 p.m. Pacific.

2592
03:22:26,409 --> 03:22:28,610
I forgot everything that was just going on.

2593
03:22:28,610 --> 03:22:29,850
I'm talking.

2594
03:22:29,850 --> 03:22:31,620
I can't be talking.

2595
03:22:31,620 --> 03:22:38,000
I didn't even put the strawberry in this.

2596
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:41,260
Okay, this is this one here.

2597
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:45,819
This one is already over here.

2598
03:22:45,819 --> 03:22:48,719
New topping, whatever that is.

2599
03:22:48,719 --> 03:23:01,430
Atoms, electrons, like what the hell is this?

2600
03:23:01,430 --> 03:23:09,940
Nerds, okay.

2601
03:23:09,940 --> 03:23:12,809
Good, okay.

2602
03:23:12,850 --> 03:23:18,020
I need a medium with Mike and Ike's

2603
03:23:18,020 --> 03:23:23,549
and just another, whatever the vanilla I think it is.

2604
03:23:23,549 --> 03:23:25,219
Put that up there.

2605
03:23:25,219 --> 03:23:27,340
Banana butter is a medium.

2606
03:23:27,340 --> 03:23:39,430
Banana and, yep.

2607
03:23:39,430 --> 03:23:52,920
Okay, whipped cream, let's go.

2608
03:23:52,920 --> 03:24:08,319
I feel like I would really like the taste of these sauces.

2609
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:10,399
I went to a 100 gecks concert and before the show

2610
03:24:10,399 --> 03:24:12,399
someone was playing your breath of the wild stream

2611
03:24:12,399 --> 03:24:13,239
on their phone.

2612
03:24:13,239 --> 03:24:20,719
What?

2613
03:24:20,719 --> 03:24:22,530
I didn't even select this.

2614
03:24:22,530 --> 03:24:30,700
Isn't that what I wanted?

2615
03:24:30,700 --> 03:24:32,260
It's banana and Reese's.

2616
03:24:42,409 --> 03:24:43,690
Invite some streamer friends over

2617
03:24:43,690 --> 03:24:47,690
and make smoothies like this for them.

2618
03:24:50,379 --> 03:24:51,219
What?

2619
03:24:51,219 --> 03:24:52,059
What's happening?

2620
03:24:52,059 --> 03:24:52,899
Okay, what is this?

2621
03:24:52,899 --> 03:24:54,569
This was this one?

2622
03:24:54,569 --> 03:24:56,000
What is this one?

2623
03:24:56,000 --> 03:25:08,979
This one here, okay.

2624
03:25:08,979 --> 03:25:10,959
Go on, hurry please.

2625
03:25:10,959 --> 03:25:15,500
Hurry up.

2626
03:25:15,500 --> 03:25:21,129
There we go.

2627
03:25:21,129 --> 03:25:25,209
That was $294, $22 tip.

2628
03:25:25,209 --> 03:25:28,719
What?

2629
03:25:28,719 --> 03:25:38,440
Okay.

2630
03:25:38,440 --> 03:25:42,709
I was impressed by your ability to not cuss.

2631
03:25:42,709 --> 03:25:43,549
Still in there.

2632
03:25:51,239 --> 03:25:52,159
Pop there.

2633
03:25:52,159 --> 03:25:54,979
Oh boy, that's a lot.

2634
03:25:54,979 --> 03:25:56,819
Okay.

2635
03:25:56,819 --> 03:25:59,219
This is whipped cream, chocolate and nuts.

2636
03:25:59,219 --> 03:26:06,530
What kind of whipped cream are?

2637
03:26:06,530 --> 03:26:08,180
It was nuts, right?

2638
03:26:08,180 --> 03:26:15,809
Yeah, of course, it's peanuts.

2639
03:26:15,809 --> 03:26:23,600
Free bananas.

2640
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:25,000
Hey, can you play Cod Zombies with me?

2641
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:26,559
I have to go to bed soon.

2642
03:26:26,559 --> 03:26:37,219
Sorry, I did medium.

2643
03:26:39,139 --> 03:26:50,680
Strawberry and pop.

2644
03:26:50,680 --> 03:26:56,239
Go off.

2645
03:26:56,239 --> 03:26:57,909
Why does this look incorrect?

2646
03:26:57,909 --> 03:27:10,930
Because it is.

2647
03:27:10,930 --> 03:27:12,139
Was it?

2648
03:27:12,139 --> 03:27:15,469
Was that wrong?

2649
03:27:15,469 --> 03:27:23,979
Wait, what's happening?

2650
03:27:23,979 --> 03:27:28,309
Was it correct?

2651
03:27:28,309 --> 03:27:32,170
Hey dude, can you shout out the New York Mets?

2652
03:27:32,170 --> 03:27:34,299
The New York Mets.

2653
03:27:34,299 --> 03:27:36,979
Let's hope that they do a good job this year.

2654
03:27:36,979 --> 03:27:40,979
Let's see some winning games.

2655
03:27:40,979 --> 03:27:42,379
You guys got it in ya.

2656
03:27:42,379 --> 03:28:04,510
Let's go New York Mets.

2657
03:28:04,510 --> 03:28:05,590
That was really sweet.

2658
03:28:17,209 --> 03:28:19,610
92.

2659
03:28:19,610 --> 03:28:22,090
Can you shout out the Yankees for me real quick?

2660
03:28:23,930 --> 03:28:25,569
Nah, that's not happening.

2661
03:28:26,850 --> 03:28:28,700
That's not happening.

2662
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:30,420
I don't think so.

2663
03:28:30,420 --> 03:28:31,260
I don't think so.

2664
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:36,420
Ban that guy, actually.

2665
03:28:36,420 --> 03:28:38,340
Nah, nah, sorry.

2666
03:28:38,340 --> 03:28:57,020
That's not happening here.

2667
03:28:57,020 --> 03:29:07,250
Nice.

2668
03:29:07,250 --> 03:29:08,090
What about the Phillies?

2669
03:29:08,090 --> 03:29:11,139
Yeah, let's go Phillies.

2670
03:29:11,139 --> 03:29:13,659
Come on, Phillies.

2671
03:29:13,659 --> 03:29:20,979
Let's have like 10 games over 500 this year.

2672
03:29:20,979 --> 03:29:22,219
Here we go, Phillies.

2673
03:29:22,219 --> 03:29:24,069
Here we go.

2674
03:29:24,069 --> 03:29:32,190
Oh yeah.

2675
03:29:32,190 --> 03:29:34,110
What about the Minnesota Twins?

2676
03:29:34,110 --> 03:29:37,530
Let's go Twins.

2677
03:29:37,530 --> 03:29:41,100
Minnesota Twins.

2678
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:42,940
All strikes, all strikes.

2679
03:29:42,940 --> 03:29:45,420
Let's go, go, go.

2680
03:29:45,420 --> 03:29:46,260
Strike them out here.

2681
03:29:46,260 --> 03:29:47,909
Strike them out here.

2682
03:29:47,909 --> 03:29:55,250
Nice, let's go Twins.

2683
03:29:55,250 --> 03:29:58,659
What about the Yankees?

2684
03:29:58,659 --> 03:30:00,180
Yeah, okay.

2685
03:30:01,540 --> 03:30:02,379
Yankees.

2686
03:30:06,379 --> 03:30:07,780
Fuck out of here.

2687
03:30:07,780 --> 03:30:08,620
Get out of here.

2688
03:30:13,469 --> 03:30:14,309
What about the Cubs?

2689
03:30:14,309 --> 03:30:16,959
Oh, my Cubs.

2690
03:30:16,959 --> 03:30:19,040
Of course.

2691
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:20,440
Of course I will.

2692
03:30:35,510 --> 03:30:37,069
Don't ever say that again.

2693
03:30:55,739 --> 03:31:02,610
They're driving crazily, I'm not.

2694
03:31:02,610 --> 03:31:03,569
This person's trying to kill me.

2695
03:31:03,569 --> 03:31:09,350
Hey, don't forget who makes your Sundays.

2696
03:31:09,350 --> 03:31:10,389
Yeah.

2697
03:31:10,389 --> 03:31:13,110
Rick, whatever your name is.

2698
03:31:13,110 --> 03:31:15,870
You come in every day and get a Sunday.

2699
03:31:15,870 --> 03:31:22,079
You take me out, that's not gonna be a good idea.

2700
03:31:22,120 --> 03:31:38,899
Ooh, I like these.

2701
03:31:38,899 --> 03:31:51,379
I need more holiday spirit, right?

2702
03:31:51,379 --> 03:31:53,100
What holiday is this?

2703
03:31:56,100 --> 03:32:06,799
What holiday am I dressing up for?

2704
03:32:06,799 --> 03:32:07,959
It's the Fourth of July?

2705
03:32:07,959 --> 03:32:09,319
Wait, how did we already get back

2706
03:32:09,319 --> 03:32:15,030
to the Fourth of July again?

2707
03:32:15,030 --> 03:32:19,649
It's been a year?

2708
03:32:19,649 --> 03:32:28,510
It's been like 12 days.

2709
03:32:28,510 --> 03:32:39,510
Hell yeah.

2710
03:32:39,510 --> 03:32:43,709
I don't think I've ever had four on it one time,

2711
03:32:43,709 --> 03:32:53,930
but I'm gonna get it.

2712
03:32:53,930 --> 03:32:56,770
It's the other Fourth of July, oh.

2713
03:32:56,770 --> 03:33:12,610
This town is very patriotic.

2714
03:33:12,610 --> 03:33:15,809
All right, I'm gonna take a beer break.

2715
03:33:15,809 --> 03:33:20,629
We'll do a, I'll come back chilling.

2716
03:33:20,629 --> 03:33:22,299
See you guys in a minute.

2717
03:33:22,299 --> 03:33:23,579
I'm gonna go refill this drink.

2718
03:33:23,579 --> 03:33:25,299
I'm gonna go pee.

2719
03:33:25,299 --> 03:40:13,510
I'll be right back.

2720
03:40:14,510 --> 03:40:19,250
Hello.

2721
03:40:19,250 --> 03:40:27,579
How's it going?

2722
03:40:27,579 --> 03:40:32,149
So I think I might just stick with this.

2723
03:40:32,149 --> 03:40:34,379
There was something else that I was gonna play,

2724
03:40:34,379 --> 03:40:49,399
but I'm just, I'm having a good time.

2725
03:40:49,399 --> 03:40:52,180
We got House Flipper this weekend,

2726
03:40:52,180 --> 03:41:00,530
which I'm really looking forward to playing that.

2727
03:41:00,530 --> 03:41:04,829
90s ads tomorrow.

2728
03:41:04,829 --> 03:41:11,520
And I didn't realize I was streaming for four hours already.

2729
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:20,729
We'll keep going.

2730
03:41:20,729 --> 03:41:30,329
Without music, this is ominous.

2731
03:41:30,329 --> 03:41:31,819
Did I do this?

2732
03:41:31,819 --> 03:41:38,270
No, I have a lot of upgrades now.

2733
03:41:38,270 --> 03:41:44,899
New customer.

2734
03:41:45,260 --> 03:41:47,059
Did I put on Club Penguin?

2735
03:41:47,059 --> 03:41:49,719
Club Penguin like music?

2736
03:41:49,719 --> 03:41:54,229
Did Club Penguin have a good OST?

2737
03:41:54,229 --> 03:42:00,819
I never played Club Penguin at all.

2738
03:42:00,819 --> 03:42:07,440
70 tracks of Club Penguin.

2739
03:42:07,440 --> 03:42:13,700
This is kind of nice.

2740
03:42:13,700 --> 03:42:18,659
Yeah, I've never played this.

2741
03:42:18,659 --> 03:42:22,600
This kind of fits this game too.

2742
03:42:22,600 --> 03:42:28,430
Oh, that's really cool.

2743
03:42:28,430 --> 03:42:47,180
I don't have to forward anymore.

2744
03:42:47,180 --> 03:42:48,020
Hello.

2745
03:42:56,260 --> 03:42:58,840
Okay, what came out first?

2746
03:42:58,840 --> 03:43:03,809
Club Penguin or World of Warcraft?

2747
03:43:03,809 --> 03:43:10,059
What came out first?

2748
03:43:10,059 --> 03:43:12,250
Did WoW come out first?

2749
03:43:12,250 --> 03:43:19,149
Interesting.

2750
03:43:19,149 --> 03:43:20,229
This is medium.

2751
03:43:20,229 --> 03:43:22,190
Do I have time?

2752
03:43:22,190 --> 03:43:33,700
Oh, no, I don't.

2753
03:43:33,700 --> 03:43:37,149
It's just toppings.

2754
03:43:37,149 --> 03:43:42,760
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2755
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:45,700
Get it out the door.

2756
03:43:45,700 --> 03:43:48,340
Was it a year before Club Penguin was 2005?

2757
03:43:48,340 --> 03:43:49,899
Yeah, cause WoW was 2004?

2758
03:43:51,100 --> 03:43:52,059
2003?

2759
03:43:52,059 --> 03:43:57,850
When was WoW?

2760
03:43:57,850 --> 03:43:59,729
Wait, there was a very early Club Penguin version

2761
03:43:59,729 --> 03:44:01,170
that might've been first.

2762
03:44:01,170 --> 03:44:03,090
I'm just trying to figure out if it was the...

2763
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:06,290
I mean, EverQuest was a really popular MMO,

2764
03:44:06,290 --> 03:44:10,090
but was Club Penguin the first popular MMO?

2765
03:44:10,090 --> 03:44:25,370
How much more popular was Club Penguin than EverQuest?

2766
03:44:25,370 --> 03:44:28,350
I need a large.

2767
03:44:28,350 --> 03:44:30,030
Ultima Online was the first one,

2768
03:44:30,030 --> 03:44:32,590
but I mean like really popular.

2769
03:44:32,590 --> 03:44:34,469
World of Warcraft popped off.

2770
03:44:34,469 --> 03:44:39,739
I feel like Club Penguin popped off big time.

2771
03:44:39,739 --> 03:44:42,700
I'm talking to more than a million concurrent players.

2772
03:44:42,700 --> 03:44:44,459
Was EverQuest more than a million concurrent?

2773
03:44:44,459 --> 03:44:48,950
More than five million concurrent?

2774
03:44:48,950 --> 03:44:49,790
Probably RuneScape?

2775
03:44:49,790 --> 03:44:52,940
Oh, probably RuneScape, yeah.

2776
03:44:52,940 --> 03:44:55,440
All right, hold on.

2777
03:44:55,479 --> 03:44:57,040
This is this one.

2778
03:44:57,040 --> 03:45:18,719
I need that large cup, and then I need a medium.

2779
03:45:18,719 --> 03:45:21,399
Okay, beat this up, let's go.

2780
03:45:21,399 --> 03:45:22,639
Somebody at the door, right?

2781
03:45:22,639 --> 03:45:29,899
Okay, good.

2782
03:45:29,899 --> 03:45:34,629
Coconut, come on, hurry up.

2783
03:45:34,629 --> 03:45:44,010
That's good.

2784
03:45:44,010 --> 03:45:46,850
RuneScape always seemed like a really fun game,

2785
03:45:46,850 --> 03:45:47,690
but for some reason,

2786
03:45:47,690 --> 03:45:52,219
I always felt like it was a lot to take in.

2787
03:45:52,219 --> 03:45:53,540
I feel the same way about RuneScape

2788
03:45:53,540 --> 03:45:57,379
that I do about Path of Exile.

2789
03:45:57,379 --> 03:45:59,659
I see clips of it, I see people playing it,

2790
03:45:59,659 --> 03:46:01,819
and I see the UI, and I see all this shit going on.

2791
03:46:01,860 --> 03:46:04,969
I'm like, hey, this looks kind of,

2792
03:46:04,969 --> 03:46:05,809
is this complicated?

2793
03:46:05,809 --> 03:46:19,590
I don't know, I can't tell.

2794
03:46:19,590 --> 03:46:30,590
I know, I know.

2795
03:46:30,590 --> 03:46:33,209
Try to play RuneScape without the nostalgia.

2796
03:46:33,209 --> 03:46:41,940
RuneScape is pretty simple.

2797
03:46:41,940 --> 03:46:42,940
Does it remind you of Diablo?

2798
03:46:42,940 --> 03:46:46,299
That's why you want to play it?

2799
03:46:46,299 --> 03:46:50,860
No, it just always seemed kind of interesting.

2800
03:46:50,860 --> 03:46:55,239
Okay, we're closed.

2801
03:46:55,239 --> 03:47:06,049
Large, this is strawberry chocolate.

2802
03:47:06,049 --> 03:47:09,540
It's pretty scuffed, but it's all right.

2803
03:47:09,540 --> 03:47:25,180
It's medium.

2804
03:47:25,180 --> 03:47:29,930
Dude, do you even like video games?

2805
03:47:29,930 --> 03:47:43,010
I think so.

2806
03:47:43,010 --> 03:47:44,010
Prove that you do.

2807
03:47:45,299 --> 03:47:52,290
Um, hey, I got 150 kills in a row in the mercenary mode.

2808
03:47:52,290 --> 03:47:56,100
What is, that means I kind of like

2809
03:47:56,100 --> 03:48:02,860
playing video games, doesn't it?

2810
03:48:02,860 --> 03:48:16,659
I like some video games.

2811
03:48:16,659 --> 03:48:17,500
Beat Hades?

2812
03:48:17,500 --> 03:48:36,319
Yeah, whipped cream chocolate.

2813
03:48:36,319 --> 03:48:39,270
Play OSU.

2814
03:48:39,270 --> 03:48:44,079
I feel like I'd be really bad at that game.

2815
03:48:44,079 --> 03:48:47,680
I'm, that's a rhythm game, right?

2816
03:48:47,680 --> 03:48:49,719
Rhythm games I do very well,

2817
03:48:49,719 --> 03:49:05,270
but not if I have to go very, very, very fast.

2818
03:49:05,270 --> 03:49:11,079
Didn't even know this person was here.

2819
03:49:11,079 --> 03:49:12,520
Being good or bad is not the point.

2820
03:49:12,520 --> 03:49:15,989
It's about having fun.

2821
03:49:15,989 --> 03:49:41,430
That's right, I agree.

2822
03:49:41,430 --> 03:49:47,940
It's better if you're good.

2823
03:49:47,940 --> 03:49:53,610
Uh, it depends on the game.

2824
03:49:53,610 --> 03:49:56,459
But yeah, if you play Dark Souls

2825
03:49:56,459 --> 03:49:59,420
and you lose to the first four enemies 100 times,

2826
03:49:59,420 --> 03:50:14,120
then it can get kind of frustrating.

2827
03:50:14,120 --> 03:50:26,059
Like you, I did not, you are changing the record.

2828
03:50:26,059 --> 03:50:49,530
I thought I did a pretty good job on stream.

2829
03:50:49,530 --> 03:50:50,889
How many people do you think actually think

2830
03:50:50,889 --> 03:50:53,229
you died to Pinwheel?

2831
03:50:53,229 --> 03:50:55,690
Probably everybody, because why even,

2832
03:50:55,690 --> 03:50:56,969
well, why would you even argue that?

2833
03:50:56,969 --> 03:51:01,969
Why are we dressed exactly the same?

2834
03:51:01,969 --> 03:51:04,219
That's a weird thing to have to argue.

2835
03:51:04,420 --> 03:51:06,420
Oh, hey, dude, he died at Pinwheel.

2836
03:51:06,420 --> 03:51:07,260
He did?

2837
03:51:07,260 --> 03:51:08,280
Yeah.

2838
03:51:08,280 --> 03:51:10,510
Oh, let me research that.

2839
03:51:10,510 --> 03:51:11,750
No, you're probably just gonna go,

2840
03:51:11,750 --> 03:51:13,149
oh, he sucks, that's funny.

2841
03:51:28,549 --> 03:51:53,129
Actually watch the VOD, the collateral, it's propaganda.

2842
03:51:53,129 --> 03:52:08,879
He did actually die to Pinwheel.

2843
03:52:08,879 --> 03:52:16,739
Better get a new t-shirt for that one.

2844
03:52:16,739 --> 03:52:26,530
Nice.

2845
03:52:26,530 --> 03:52:28,250
Banana butter, berry blast.

2846
03:52:28,250 --> 03:52:41,280
Yep.

2847
03:52:41,280 --> 03:52:42,299
I just took a picture of my sandwich

2848
03:52:42,299 --> 03:52:44,360
because it looked so good.

2849
03:52:44,360 --> 03:52:48,340
Oh, that's cool.

2850
03:52:48,340 --> 03:52:51,899
That's cool.

2851
03:52:51,899 --> 03:52:55,379
Hazelnut swizzle?

2852
03:52:55,379 --> 03:52:56,219
Tiramisu?

2853
03:53:01,739 --> 03:53:11,600
I can surf tiramisu now.

2854
03:53:11,600 --> 03:53:19,180
You want a tiramisu in your, wait, what?

2855
03:53:19,180 --> 03:53:22,069
It seems kind of amazing.

2856
03:53:22,069 --> 03:53:29,299
Tiramisu, vanilla paste, whipped cream, and hazelnut.

2857
03:53:29,299 --> 03:53:31,870
That sounds awesome.

2858
03:53:31,870 --> 03:53:41,659
That sounds really good.

2859
03:53:41,659 --> 03:53:43,459
Still gonna do the courthouse stream?

2860
03:53:43,459 --> 03:53:49,020
No, that's a long, long time away from, that's gone.

2861
03:54:00,860 --> 03:54:01,860
Tiramisu?

2862
03:54:01,860 --> 03:54:06,379
That's how you say it, right?

2863
03:54:06,379 --> 03:54:14,530
I'm saying it, right?

2864
03:54:14,530 --> 03:54:20,260
This one's easy.

2865
03:54:20,260 --> 03:54:21,579
Where are you playing these now?

2866
03:54:21,579 --> 03:54:27,409
There is only one available on Steam at the moment.

2867
03:54:27,409 --> 03:54:30,489
This is Poppa's Freezeria Deluxe.

2868
03:54:30,489 --> 03:54:31,940
It's on Steam.

2869
03:54:31,940 --> 03:54:33,860
I don't know what their plans are for the other ones.

2870
03:54:33,860 --> 03:54:35,540
If they do have any plans, I don't know.

2871
03:54:35,540 --> 03:54:46,899
But this one is on Steam.

2872
03:54:46,899 --> 03:54:53,149
Got it perfect, yeah?

2873
03:54:53,149 --> 03:55:01,479
This one's gonna be done in a second.

2874
03:55:01,479 --> 03:55:09,610
All right, let's go.

2875
03:55:09,610 --> 03:55:12,870
Chocolate whipped cream.

2876
03:55:12,870 --> 03:55:15,180
You know what other games really,

2877
03:55:15,180 --> 03:55:16,979
here's another banger of a game.

2878
03:55:16,979 --> 03:55:22,329
Do you guys remember Hand of Fate?

2879
03:55:22,329 --> 03:55:28,020
That game is awesome.

2880
03:55:28,059 --> 03:55:31,100
I forgot how unbelievably good that game was.

2881
03:55:31,100 --> 03:55:36,989
I feel bad I didn't play it way more.

2882
03:55:36,989 --> 03:55:38,549
There's a second one, yeah.

2883
03:55:38,549 --> 03:55:39,389
This too?

2884
03:55:48,690 --> 03:55:51,049
All right, I don't know how to make a berry blast,

2885
03:55:51,049 --> 03:55:54,819
but we're gonna try in a second here.

2886
03:55:54,819 --> 03:56:01,360
Medium and it's blueberry, strawberry.

2887
03:56:01,360 --> 03:56:02,200
It was amazing.

2888
03:56:02,200 --> 03:56:07,639
I think the developers went out of business, really?

2889
03:56:07,639 --> 03:56:09,819
Did they really?

2890
03:56:09,819 --> 03:56:25,020
That's such a unique game.

2891
03:56:25,020 --> 03:56:35,309
That's a cookie, right?

2892
03:56:35,309 --> 03:56:37,750
I'd like to see you do a RuneScape stream one day.

2893
03:56:37,750 --> 03:56:40,229
Is RuneScape the kind of game where I would open it

2894
03:56:40,950 --> 03:56:42,829
and then like 1,000 people would follow me around

2895
03:56:42,829 --> 03:56:46,100
and kill me for like the two logs that I have?

2896
03:56:46,100 --> 03:56:49,020
Is that gonna happen?

2897
03:56:49,020 --> 03:56:53,469
Probably.

2898
03:56:53,469 --> 03:56:59,309
This is a strawberry, right?

2899
03:56:59,309 --> 03:57:06,250
Yep.

2900
03:57:06,250 --> 03:57:09,879
You would be protected.

2901
03:57:09,879 --> 03:57:21,469
They can't kill you, but they will follow you.

2902
03:57:21,469 --> 03:57:36,260
This is, what is this one?

2903
03:57:36,260 --> 03:57:38,190
Oh, okay, we're good.

2904
03:57:38,190 --> 03:57:39,430
That's berry blast.

2905
03:57:39,430 --> 03:57:49,229
This is tiramisu red velvet.

2906
03:57:49,229 --> 03:57:52,270
I made a character on RuneScape named Jerma Walken

2907
03:57:52,270 --> 03:57:54,190
and made it look like you a year ago.

2908
03:58:01,030 --> 03:58:13,639
This is a nice song.

2909
03:58:13,639 --> 03:58:14,680
This one's coming up.

2910
03:58:18,270 --> 03:58:19,829
Which one's easier?

2911
03:58:19,829 --> 03:58:20,950
Probably this one.

2912
03:58:20,950 --> 03:58:21,790
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2913
03:58:21,790 --> 03:58:23,569
This one's harder because I don't know.

2914
03:58:23,569 --> 03:58:24,409
It's all right.

2915
03:58:29,129 --> 03:58:31,159
Cream, cream, cream.

2916
03:58:31,159 --> 03:58:32,000
What was it?

2917
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:38,959
Cream, cream, cream, cream.

2918
03:58:38,959 --> 03:58:40,399
Cream, cream, cream, cream.

2919
03:58:40,399 --> 03:58:50,780
And it was just cream, cream.

2920
03:58:50,780 --> 03:58:57,909
And then nerds.

2921
03:58:57,909 --> 03:59:01,989
And then the wafer, cherry wafer.

2922
03:59:06,459 --> 03:59:10,739
It was the wrong cream.

2923
03:59:18,340 --> 03:59:21,149
This one.

2924
03:59:21,149 --> 03:59:27,250
I got it right.

2925
03:59:27,250 --> 03:59:30,620
Peanuts.

2926
03:59:30,620 --> 03:59:47,579
And then a cinnamon stick.

2927
03:59:47,579 --> 03:59:54,909
This is whipped cream, peanuts.

2928
03:59:54,909 --> 03:59:59,600
And then a cinnamon stick.

2929
03:59:59,600 --> 04:00:10,989
And a cherry, a coffee.

2930
04:00:10,989 --> 04:00:14,120
Are you ever gonna play Pirates of the Caribbean online?

2931
04:00:14,120 --> 04:00:16,750
Years ago, we did an MMO night

2932
04:00:16,750 --> 04:00:19,909
where we played a bunch of free MMOs.

2933
04:00:19,909 --> 04:00:24,180
And it was kind of a disaster.

2934
04:00:24,180 --> 04:00:33,219
It was like five years ago, a long time ago.

2935
04:00:34,059 --> 04:00:35,260
This many years later,

2936
04:00:35,260 --> 04:00:37,700
I wanna say that it would be way harder

2937
04:00:37,700 --> 04:00:44,399
to do a free MMO stream or free to play MMO stream.

2938
04:00:44,399 --> 04:00:46,840
I think back like five years ago or so,

2939
04:00:46,840 --> 04:00:48,440
or whatever it was,

2940
04:00:48,440 --> 04:00:51,440
I think there were like two or 3000 concurrent viewers here

2941
04:00:51,440 --> 04:00:53,659
and that it was already hard.

2942
04:00:53,659 --> 04:00:58,360
If I did that right now, I don't know if that would work.

2943
04:00:58,360 --> 04:01:02,659
It might be hard to do that now.

2944
04:01:02,659 --> 04:01:13,260
It was already hard to do that back then.

2945
04:01:13,260 --> 04:01:15,620
Shit.

2946
04:01:15,620 --> 04:01:22,659
Hold fast, hold fast was a lot of fun.

2947
04:01:22,659 --> 04:01:24,540
Sire, we must do something.

2948
04:01:24,540 --> 04:01:28,430
The enemy is playing copyrighted music at us.

2949
04:01:28,430 --> 04:01:33,020
That's a classic.

2950
04:01:33,020 --> 04:01:45,309
Really, how is that not going in?

2951
04:01:45,309 --> 04:01:51,299
Pizzel?

2952
04:01:51,299 --> 04:02:05,209
They're clowns?

2953
04:02:05,209 --> 04:02:08,540
You're gonna play Project Diva again?

2954
04:02:08,540 --> 04:02:11,139
I think I really got most of what I...

2955
04:02:11,139 --> 04:02:13,049
Played the hell out of that.

2956
04:02:13,049 --> 04:02:28,370
I did like every song three times.

2957
04:02:28,370 --> 04:02:31,409
What's your favorite Minecraft Steve copy?

2958
04:02:31,409 --> 04:02:34,129
Oh my God.

2959
04:02:41,659 --> 04:02:45,670
My brain only works in one fucking direction.

2960
04:02:45,670 --> 04:02:48,190
That person asked me what my favorite ice cream flavor

2961
04:02:48,190 --> 04:02:49,030
and topping was,

2962
04:02:49,030 --> 04:02:51,909
and then they did an emote of Minecraft Steve.

2963
04:02:51,909 --> 04:02:55,069
That's the only thing that I could see.

2964
04:02:55,069 --> 04:03:00,379
Whatever.

2965
04:03:04,579 --> 04:03:13,969
Dude, come on.

2966
04:03:13,969 --> 04:03:16,250
Why did I just do this twice?

2967
04:03:16,250 --> 04:03:17,129
Throw it away.

2968
04:03:17,129 --> 04:03:31,290
Throw this in the trash.

2969
04:03:31,290 --> 04:03:32,879
Shit.

2970
04:03:33,879 --> 04:03:50,059
It made me sound so strange.

2971
04:03:50,059 --> 04:03:51,020
Ooh, it's one of those cookies.

2972
04:03:51,020 --> 04:03:56,100
I like these.

2973
04:03:56,100 --> 04:04:00,260
Have you watched the new Resident Evil movie trailer?

2974
04:04:00,260 --> 04:04:03,579
No, because correct me if I'm wrong here,

2975
04:04:03,579 --> 04:04:07,719
but every Resident Evil movie,

2976
04:04:07,719 --> 04:04:08,959
all of them,

2977
04:04:08,959 --> 04:04:11,319
I feel like have been just,

2978
04:04:11,319 --> 04:04:15,110
like they're not even Resident Evil movies.

2979
04:04:15,110 --> 04:04:17,309
It's like an AI came up with the story

2980
04:04:17,309 --> 04:04:20,010
for what a Resident Evil movie might be.

2981
04:04:20,010 --> 04:04:20,850
And I'm not even,

2982
04:04:20,850 --> 04:04:22,569
I'm not talking like chat GPT three or four.

2983
04:04:22,569 --> 04:04:26,940
I'm talking like chat GPT one.

2984
04:04:26,940 --> 04:04:33,229
Whatever that technology was.

2985
04:04:33,229 --> 04:04:35,670
I have not paid attention to Resident Evil's movies

2986
04:04:35,670 --> 04:04:38,309
in at least a decade or two,

2987
04:04:38,309 --> 04:04:53,799
because they're all seem like kind of weird.

2988
04:04:53,799 --> 04:04:57,270
All right, there's people waiting.

2989
04:04:57,270 --> 04:04:59,049
Need a berry blast.

2990
04:04:59,049 --> 04:05:06,760
That's blueberry and strawberry.

2991
04:05:06,760 --> 04:05:10,739
They are fun garbage.

2992
04:05:10,739 --> 04:05:11,739
I just, I haven't even said,

2993
04:05:11,739 --> 04:05:17,270
I haven't had any interest in them at all.

2994
04:05:17,270 --> 04:05:20,649
Should I watch them?

2995
04:05:20,649 --> 04:05:21,850
I don't really have a,

2996
04:05:21,850 --> 04:05:22,690
I don't really,

2997
04:05:22,690 --> 04:05:24,329
there's a lot of movies I think that are gonna come

2998
04:05:24,329 --> 04:05:26,299
in front of that first,

2999
04:05:26,299 --> 04:05:33,690
if I'm honest.

3000
04:05:33,690 --> 04:05:35,409
Watch the CG movies,

3001
04:05:35,409 --> 04:05:49,690
not the live action ones.

3002
04:05:49,690 --> 04:05:53,069
Come on.

3003
04:05:53,069 --> 04:06:03,379
Perfect timing on this one.

3004
04:06:03,379 --> 04:06:05,020
On some of these,

3005
04:06:05,020 --> 04:06:07,340
I've got like a paragraph complaint here.

3006
04:06:07,340 --> 04:06:08,180
Mr. Elberson,

3007
04:06:08,180 --> 04:06:10,260
if you continue to anger the Steve Jackson

3008
04:06:10,260 --> 04:06:12,420
sorcery enjoyers high council,

3009
04:06:12,420 --> 04:06:16,260
your continuing animosity for sorcery angers us.

3010
04:06:16,260 --> 04:06:17,100
Do not comply,

3011
04:06:17,100 --> 04:06:17,979
there will be dire consequences.

3012
04:06:17,979 --> 04:06:19,340
You have two months, Mr. Elberson,

3013
04:06:19,340 --> 04:06:21,579
to do another stream of the hit adaptation

3014
04:06:21,579 --> 04:06:22,659
of the Choose Your Own Adventure book,

3015
04:06:22,659 --> 04:06:24,379
Steve Jackson's Sorcery,

3016
04:06:24,379 --> 04:06:26,299
created by Inkle Studios.

3017
04:06:26,299 --> 04:06:28,579
The consequences will be severe if you do not comply.

3018
04:06:28,579 --> 04:06:31,379
Sincerely, Steve Jackson sorcery enjoyer high council.

3019
04:06:33,899 --> 04:06:34,819
That's enough time.

3020
04:06:34,819 --> 04:06:49,120
I got two months.

3021
04:06:49,120 --> 04:06:57,659
Here.

3022
04:06:57,659 --> 04:06:59,750
It's not berry.

3023
04:07:00,829 --> 04:07:02,959
Oh, it's this one.

3024
04:07:02,959 --> 04:07:09,879
Oh.

3025
04:07:09,879 --> 04:07:11,440
What about Tears of the Kingdom?

3026
04:07:14,530 --> 04:07:16,809
I have to finish Breath of the Wild.

3027
04:07:16,809 --> 04:07:20,409
There's no world where I just start playing Tears

3028
04:07:20,409 --> 04:07:22,329
of the Kingdom when I have one more Guardian

3029
04:07:22,329 --> 04:07:24,340
to beat in Breath of the Wild.

3030
04:07:24,340 --> 04:07:26,489
You guys would never let me do that.

3031
04:07:26,489 --> 04:07:38,809
I would never let me do that.

3032
04:07:38,809 --> 04:07:42,590
Do you don't get to the last hour

3033
04:07:42,590 --> 04:07:44,979
of a movie that you've been watching?

3034
04:07:44,979 --> 04:07:57,059
Turn the movie off and just play the sequel instead.

3035
04:07:57,100 --> 04:08:10,590
Okay, this is pink, blue, red.

3036
04:08:10,590 --> 04:08:12,790
I haven't had a cotton candy flavored thing

3037
04:08:12,790 --> 04:08:13,709
in a very long time.

3038
04:08:13,709 --> 04:08:15,069
And I know exactly what it tastes like,

3039
04:08:15,069 --> 04:08:21,110
but I forget everything about it.

3040
04:08:21,110 --> 04:08:22,229
Anybody else here get like that?

3041
04:08:22,229 --> 04:08:23,750
Where you almost just want to be reminded

3042
04:08:23,750 --> 04:08:24,870
of a very specific flavor,

3043
04:08:24,870 --> 04:08:26,709
because cotton candy flavoring,

3044
04:08:26,709 --> 04:08:30,899
nothing else is like it on earth.

3045
04:08:30,899 --> 04:08:33,500
I don't know what concoction of weird chemicals it is,

3046
04:08:33,500 --> 04:08:36,579
but it is nothing on earth that it tastes like.

3047
04:08:36,579 --> 04:08:43,309
Only cotton candy flavoring.

3048
04:08:43,309 --> 04:08:53,219
Is it wrong?

3049
04:08:53,219 --> 04:08:54,059
Like sugar?

3050
04:08:54,059 --> 04:08:57,219
No, no, I'm talking cotton candy flavoring.

3051
04:08:57,219 --> 04:08:58,260
The fake cotton candy,

3052
04:08:58,260 --> 04:08:59,659
just like how there's fake banana

3053
04:08:59,659 --> 04:09:12,430
and it does not taste like a banana.

3054
04:09:12,430 --> 04:09:14,739
Bubblegum flavor, yep.

3055
04:09:14,739 --> 04:09:33,709
Now you guys get it.

3056
04:09:33,709 --> 04:09:34,629
I do like banana.

3057
04:09:34,629 --> 04:09:36,069
Banana cream pie is my favorite.

3058
04:09:36,069 --> 04:09:38,270
Oh, somebody wanted to ask what my favorite dessert was.

3059
04:09:38,270 --> 04:09:39,110
Did you?

3060
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:40,350
I don't know, whatever.

3061
04:09:40,350 --> 04:09:41,670
Banana cream pie.

3062
04:09:41,670 --> 04:09:45,629
S'mores are probably one, two, and three.

3063
04:09:45,629 --> 04:09:50,700
What's the third one?

3064
04:09:50,700 --> 04:09:58,559
Banana cream pie.

3065
04:09:58,559 --> 04:10:02,860
I just tasted artificial cotton candy flavoring right now.

3066
04:10:02,860 --> 04:10:05,510
My brain just made me taste it.

3067
04:10:05,510 --> 04:10:07,250
Interesting.

3068
04:10:07,250 --> 04:10:09,489
Yeah, yep, that's exactly what it tastes like.

3069
04:10:09,489 --> 04:10:13,620
I can taste it right now.

3070
04:10:13,620 --> 04:10:16,299
My brain had to go file a bunch of hard drive stuff

3071
04:10:16,299 --> 04:10:28,860
and find it, but I can taste it.

3072
04:10:28,860 --> 04:10:34,989
Weirdly enough, I can taste the slush version.

3073
04:10:34,989 --> 04:10:38,069
Right now I can taste the slush version

3074
04:10:38,069 --> 04:10:47,819
of a cotton candy slush.

3075
04:10:47,819 --> 04:10:57,270
That's gross.

3076
04:10:57,270 --> 04:10:58,790
Why are you still playing this?

3077
04:10:58,790 --> 04:11:12,229
I don't know, we're just hanging out.

3078
04:11:12,229 --> 04:11:29,940
All right, I messed this one up last time.

3079
04:11:29,979 --> 04:11:31,940
Oh, wait, I can't bump into it from here.

3080
04:11:31,940 --> 04:11:35,709
I thought I could.

3081
04:11:35,709 --> 04:12:40,819
Oops, got it.

3082
04:12:40,819 --> 04:12:41,819
I didn't want to do that.

3083
04:12:41,819 --> 04:12:48,920
There you go.

3084
04:12:48,920 --> 04:12:55,500
I believe his lies, don't forget.

3085
04:12:55,500 --> 04:13:07,069
What are you doing?

3086
04:13:07,069 --> 04:13:10,219
I will play, I will play it.

3087
04:13:10,219 --> 04:13:11,420
I'll play sorcery.

3088
04:13:14,750 --> 04:13:20,989
Okay, you want this chunky.

3089
04:13:20,989 --> 04:13:22,649
Little too much chocolate though.

3090
04:13:22,649 --> 04:13:26,819
I need something to break that up.

3091
04:13:26,819 --> 04:13:37,620
Way too much.

3092
04:13:37,620 --> 04:13:47,139
Get this out quick.

3093
04:13:47,139 --> 04:13:48,500
Play Mega Man Legends 2.

3094
04:13:50,719 --> 04:13:51,879
Is this done?

3095
04:13:51,879 --> 04:13:54,540
It's not, what's, okay, why isn't it?

3096
04:13:54,540 --> 04:13:57,149
It is done.

3097
04:13:57,149 --> 04:14:13,280
I wonder why I didn't answer the phone.

3098
04:14:14,120 --> 04:14:33,739
I have not seen the Mario movie,

3099
04:14:33,739 --> 04:14:51,750
although I very much anticipate seeing it.

3100
04:14:51,750 --> 04:15:19,110
Berry Blast, I watched it today, it was epic.

3101
04:15:19,110 --> 04:15:22,280
You could be a bug, which one would you be?

3102
04:15:26,100 --> 04:15:28,100
What bug lives the longest?

3103
04:15:28,100 --> 04:15:29,340
Because any bug you pick is like,

3104
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:42,979
you're dead in like fucking four days.

3105
04:15:42,979 --> 04:15:58,149
A cockroach that lives for, how long do they live for?

3106
04:15:58,149 --> 04:16:00,719
They live forever.

3107
04:16:00,719 --> 04:16:14,819
I don't think that's true.

3108
04:16:14,819 --> 04:16:16,180
He's so bad at this.

3109
04:16:16,180 --> 04:16:20,940
I have not had a single bad order in maybe three,

3110
04:16:21,780 --> 04:16:22,989
in four and a half hours.

3111
04:16:22,989 --> 04:16:35,879
I've had three bad orders across 200 or 300 orders.

3112
04:16:36,000 --> 04:17:00,659
You don't know what you're talking about.

3113
04:17:00,659 --> 04:17:10,299
Termite queens live 25 to 50 years.

3114
04:17:10,299 --> 04:17:15,219
Beetle grubs live in the ground for like 16 years.

3115
04:17:15,219 --> 04:17:18,010
Splendor beetle, one of the longest living insects

3116
04:17:18,010 --> 04:17:19,149
in the world.

3117
04:17:19,149 --> 04:17:22,709
An impressive lifespan that averages 31 years.

3118
04:17:22,709 --> 04:17:25,950
With the longest recorded lifespan reaching 51 years,

3119
04:17:25,950 --> 04:17:40,360
I would want to be a Splendor beetle.

3120
04:17:40,360 --> 04:17:42,639
Isn't red velvet just a made up flavor?

3121
04:17:42,639 --> 04:17:54,909
It's not actually anything.

3122
04:17:54,909 --> 04:18:01,569
It's just chocolate right now.

3123
04:18:01,569 --> 04:18:06,950
All right, I gotta go place these.

3124
04:18:06,950 --> 04:18:10,739
It's just beets and chocolate.

3125
04:18:10,739 --> 04:18:13,059
It's supposed to be a cake.

3126
04:18:13,059 --> 04:18:14,500
Yeah, all right, this one's large.

3127
04:18:14,500 --> 04:18:16,780
This one's the medium.

3128
04:18:16,780 --> 04:18:20,420
Okay, so now you need medium.

3129
04:18:20,420 --> 04:18:30,360
This is strawberry banana.

3130
04:18:30,360 --> 04:18:31,200
They're all medium.

3131
04:18:31,200 --> 04:18:34,139
All right, let's go.

3132
04:18:34,139 --> 04:18:49,350
Hold this one off.

3133
04:18:49,350 --> 04:18:56,569
Okay, what is that little thing here?

3134
04:18:56,569 --> 04:19:03,840
A mango or something?

3135
04:19:03,840 --> 04:19:04,680
Oh, come on.

3136
04:19:11,819 --> 04:19:15,389
Shit.

3137
04:19:15,389 --> 04:19:29,260
Oh, that was sloppy.

3138
04:19:29,260 --> 04:19:34,069
Everybody here is ordering these like it's a subway.

3139
04:19:34,069 --> 04:19:35,069
All right, what do you want on it?

3140
04:19:35,069 --> 04:19:37,430
I guess I'll take a banana peppers,

3141
04:19:38,590 --> 04:19:39,989
fucking an oregano.

3142
04:19:39,989 --> 04:19:42,309
I'll give him some oil, maybe some vinegar.

3143
04:19:42,309 --> 04:19:43,790
And maybe, you know what?

3144
04:19:43,790 --> 04:19:45,909
Put like extra lettuce on it, a tomato.

3145
04:19:47,350 --> 04:19:55,479
These orders are all fucked up.

3146
04:19:55,479 --> 04:19:57,649
What kind of cheese do you got?

3147
04:19:57,649 --> 04:19:58,530
Oh, no, I don't care.

3148
04:19:58,530 --> 04:20:00,620
Just put all of them on.

3149
04:20:00,620 --> 04:20:06,899
Just do one slice of every cheese.

3150
04:20:06,899 --> 04:20:07,739
What do I got?

3151
04:20:07,739 --> 04:20:08,559
Cherries?

3152
04:20:08,559 --> 04:20:09,399
Yeah, put one on.

3153
04:20:09,399 --> 04:20:10,780
Cookies too?

3154
04:20:10,780 --> 04:20:11,930
Yeah, fucking.

3155
04:20:11,930 --> 04:20:12,770
What are those things?

3156
04:20:12,770 --> 04:20:28,819
Put it on.

3157
04:20:28,819 --> 04:20:32,770
Banana peppers and ice cream.

3158
04:20:32,770 --> 04:20:34,290
I love banana peppers.

3159
04:20:34,290 --> 04:20:40,629
They're so good.

3160
04:20:40,629 --> 04:20:43,659
You thinking of Quiznos?

3161
04:20:43,659 --> 04:20:44,860
Quiznos.

3162
04:20:44,860 --> 04:20:53,190
Man, I heard sad tale about Quiznos.

3163
04:20:53,190 --> 04:20:56,590
Just, it's just unfortunate.

3164
04:20:56,590 --> 04:21:00,860
That place was unbelievably good.

3165
04:21:00,860 --> 04:21:02,819
Unbelievably good.

3166
04:21:02,819 --> 04:21:05,329
What the hell happened?

3167
04:21:05,329 --> 04:21:07,829
They made the best sandwiches.

3168
04:21:07,829 --> 04:21:09,829
No one can even come close.

3169
04:21:09,829 --> 04:21:13,979
Every other chain sub shop that I've ever been to,

3170
04:21:13,979 --> 04:21:15,739
it was so far behind.

3171
04:21:15,979 --> 04:21:22,340
Literally D and Cs to Quiznos' S.

3172
04:21:22,340 --> 04:21:23,340
No one even comes close.

3173
04:21:23,340 --> 04:21:24,559
I don't wanna hear anybody else.

3174
04:21:24,559 --> 04:21:27,200
I don't wanna hear any of the other restaurants.

3175
04:21:27,200 --> 04:21:30,639
Nope, they don't even come close.

3176
04:21:30,639 --> 04:21:33,360
Honey Bacon Club is the single best chain sandwich

3177
04:21:33,360 --> 04:21:34,959
I've ever had in my life.

3178
04:21:34,959 --> 04:21:39,739
And it's S plus and nothing is even on A.

3179
04:21:39,739 --> 04:21:43,319
There's nothing is even on A.

3180
04:21:43,319 --> 04:21:45,069
Some stuff is on B.

3181
04:21:45,069 --> 04:21:46,709
There's a lot of Bs.

3182
04:21:46,709 --> 04:21:53,180
B pluses, maybe some A minuses, but no.

3183
04:21:53,180 --> 04:21:54,639
You are capping out of your mind.

3184
04:21:54,639 --> 04:21:56,500
It was just as bad as Subway.

3185
04:21:56,500 --> 04:21:58,020
No, no, it was not.

3186
04:21:58,020 --> 04:22:01,940
No way, no way.

3187
04:22:01,940 --> 04:22:08,790
Quiznos was so good.

3188
04:22:08,790 --> 04:22:11,709
I'm just guessing.

3189
04:22:11,709 --> 04:22:13,409
It was barely different.

3190
04:22:13,409 --> 04:22:15,209
You didn't, no, no, you didn't even eat it.

3191
04:22:15,209 --> 04:22:17,440
I don't think you ate it.

3192
04:22:17,440 --> 04:22:19,450
You probably saw it being,

3193
04:22:19,450 --> 04:22:22,500
you probably saw like somebody walking around with it,

3194
04:22:22,500 --> 04:22:23,340
eating it.

3195
04:22:23,340 --> 04:22:24,159
You know what I mean?

3196
04:22:24,159 --> 04:22:25,000
Like the big tube.

3197
04:22:25,000 --> 04:22:25,940
You probably saw somebody eating a tube

3198
04:22:25,940 --> 04:22:27,420
and you're like, I don't know about that.

3199
04:22:27,420 --> 04:22:29,930
You didn't eat it.

3200
04:22:29,930 --> 04:22:30,770
Did you eat it?

3201
04:22:30,770 --> 04:22:32,790
I don't think you did.

3202
04:22:32,790 --> 04:22:40,780
Did you eat it?

3203
04:22:40,780 --> 04:22:41,620
Did you eat it?

3204
04:22:42,680 --> 04:22:44,590
I'm serious.

3205
04:22:44,590 --> 04:22:49,379
I feel like I love Quiznos and I don't love Subway.

3206
04:22:49,379 --> 04:22:56,049
They're very, very distinct for me.

3207
04:22:56,049 --> 04:23:00,700
Corporate fucked over all the ingredient providers.

3208
04:23:00,700 --> 04:23:02,940
Come on.

3209
04:23:02,940 --> 04:23:14,829
Really?

3210
04:23:14,829 --> 04:23:17,590
Double points?

3211
04:23:17,590 --> 04:23:19,229
I promise you I ate it.

3212
04:23:19,229 --> 04:23:20,069
Okay, all right.

3213
04:23:20,069 --> 04:23:22,350
I believe you.

3214
04:23:22,350 --> 04:23:32,200
I believe you.

3215
04:23:32,200 --> 04:23:33,639
They jacked up prices and forced stores

3216
04:23:33,639 --> 04:23:37,010
to buy from the suppliers.

3217
04:23:37,010 --> 04:23:39,250
Can't we just have good yummy sandwiches?

3218
04:23:39,250 --> 04:23:45,590
Like, you know what I'm saying?

3219
04:23:45,590 --> 04:24:02,459
Why can't we just have just delicious sandwiches?

3220
04:24:02,459 --> 04:24:06,549
Just buy a toaster oven, make them at home.

3221
04:24:06,549 --> 04:24:07,670
It's different though.

3222
04:24:07,670 --> 04:24:09,290
I am gonna make a statement here

3223
04:24:09,290 --> 04:24:13,829
and I know a lot of people agree with this.

3224
04:24:13,829 --> 04:24:15,780
It does not matter what the food is.

3225
04:24:15,780 --> 04:24:17,059
It doesn't matter how much I spend on it

3226
04:24:17,059 --> 04:24:19,459
and how much time I spend, how quality the,

3227
04:24:19,459 --> 04:24:23,809
I could buy the highest quality ingredients in the world.

3228
04:24:23,809 --> 04:24:27,850
I could go and get, oh, like delicious Wagyu beef.

3229
04:24:27,850 --> 04:24:32,180
Make a Wagyu beef burger on the grill at your house.

3230
04:24:32,180 --> 04:24:35,680
It is never as good as if somebody else makes it for me.

3231
04:24:35,680 --> 04:24:36,500
Always.

3232
04:24:36,500 --> 04:24:38,659
It is never as good.

3233
04:24:38,659 --> 04:24:42,379
I could follow a recipe to a tea, take a bite out of it

3234
04:24:42,379 --> 04:24:43,989
and go, this sucks.

3235
04:24:43,989 --> 04:24:45,899
I did something wrong.

3236
04:24:45,899 --> 04:24:47,420
When somebody else does the same thing

3237
04:24:47,420 --> 04:24:49,020
and makes it for me, right?

3238
04:24:49,020 --> 04:24:52,489
Whether it's a restaurant, it's always better.

3239
04:24:52,489 --> 04:24:56,299
It just always is better than me, way better than me.

3240
04:24:56,299 --> 04:24:59,469
And I've come to accept that.

3241
04:24:59,469 --> 04:25:00,590
Like you're just doing this way.

3242
04:25:00,590 --> 04:25:04,190
You just, you're doing something way better than I am.

3243
04:25:04,190 --> 04:25:24,219
So yeah, let's get this out.

3244
04:25:24,219 --> 04:25:26,959
I think it's because you're afraid of ovens.

3245
04:25:26,959 --> 04:25:39,680
You still cook with an oven.

3246
04:25:39,680 --> 04:25:43,409
I bet you like unsalted butter.

3247
04:25:43,409 --> 04:25:45,649
And it's appropriate places to use it.

3248
04:25:45,649 --> 04:25:52,110
It should be used.

3249
04:25:52,110 --> 04:25:52,950
How's this?

3250
04:25:52,950 --> 04:25:54,600
This is a weird combo.

3251
04:25:56,559 --> 04:26:17,180
All right, I still haven't made this large.

3252
04:26:17,180 --> 04:26:25,760
None of these are, okay, this one's done.

3253
04:26:25,760 --> 04:26:27,120
Is this the right one?

3254
04:26:27,120 --> 04:26:36,120
Oh, shut up.

3255
04:26:36,120 --> 04:26:39,180
We ran out of pink whipped cream.

3256
04:26:39,180 --> 04:26:51,399
Sorry.

3257
04:26:51,399 --> 04:26:52,680
Is there something wrong with unsalted butter?

3258
04:26:52,680 --> 04:26:56,239
I don't know what the hell, what's the deal?

3259
04:26:56,239 --> 04:26:59,280
Uh-oh, I'm starting to lose control here.

3260
04:26:59,280 --> 04:27:06,860
This is this one, I'm losing control.

3261
04:27:06,860 --> 04:27:08,780
Oh my goodness, I've lost control.

3262
04:27:12,360 --> 04:27:22,059
Strawberries, okay, hurry up.

3263
04:27:22,059 --> 04:27:29,129
Okay, hurry up.

3264
04:27:29,170 --> 04:27:50,610
Really not even that bad for having the wrong whipped cream.

3265
04:27:50,610 --> 04:27:54,510
I love food though.

3266
04:27:54,510 --> 04:27:56,940
I could be having a really bad day

3267
04:27:56,940 --> 04:28:00,459
and just a nice delicious meal.

3268
04:28:00,459 --> 04:28:12,790
Just changes everything, it really does.

3269
04:28:12,790 --> 04:28:13,629
Are you a good cook?

3270
04:28:13,629 --> 04:28:15,860
No.

3271
04:28:15,860 --> 04:28:18,180
I know how to make a few things.

3272
04:28:18,180 --> 04:28:25,899
That's it.

3273
04:28:25,899 --> 04:28:27,700
I can make a good fish.

3274
04:28:27,700 --> 04:28:29,700
I can make a good salmon in the oven.

3275
04:28:29,700 --> 04:28:42,729
I can make a good cod in the pan.

3276
04:28:42,729 --> 04:28:45,020
I like fish.

3277
04:28:45,020 --> 04:28:57,520
Fish sandwiches, pretty easy.

3278
04:28:57,520 --> 04:29:00,719
Egg salad, egg salad's not necessarily cooking

3279
04:29:00,719 --> 04:29:03,159
as much as it's putting something together.

3280
04:29:04,040 --> 04:29:07,040
I mean, I guess technically you are cooking something.

3281
04:29:07,040 --> 04:29:08,819
You cook the eggs.

3282
04:29:08,819 --> 04:29:09,659
You know what, I'm gonna own that.

3283
04:29:09,659 --> 04:29:11,020
Yeah, it's good.

3284
04:29:11,020 --> 04:29:13,170
My recipe is phenomenal.

3285
04:29:13,170 --> 04:29:23,850
Yeah, I'm gonna own that because it's good, it's true.

3286
04:29:23,850 --> 04:29:26,420
What is this thing?

3287
04:29:26,420 --> 04:29:27,579
Okay, I need sprinkles.

3288
04:29:31,219 --> 04:29:38,850
There's not been one bad review of that recipe, by the way.

3289
04:29:38,850 --> 04:29:54,549
Coconut, and there's been zero reviews.

3290
04:29:54,549 --> 04:30:00,049
There's been at least five or 10.

3291
04:30:00,049 --> 04:30:15,180
There's been at least five or 10.

3292
04:30:15,219 --> 04:30:30,819
Peanuts and then double stick curry.

3293
04:30:30,819 --> 04:30:32,950
What's wrong with this?

3294
04:30:32,950 --> 04:30:41,700
Blend it too much?

3295
04:30:41,700 --> 04:30:43,379
Oh my God, scared of it.

3296
04:30:43,379 --> 04:30:45,739
What is this one?

3297
04:30:45,739 --> 04:30:47,690
This one doesn't, I don't even know what that,

3298
04:30:47,690 --> 04:31:03,579
okay, let's make two more.

3299
04:31:03,579 --> 04:31:20,200
This is banana.

3300
04:31:20,200 --> 04:31:24,760
Please try.

3301
04:31:24,760 --> 04:31:26,920
Did you get permission to leak the family egg recipe

3302
04:31:26,920 --> 04:31:30,250
or was it a Prometheus?

3303
04:31:30,250 --> 04:31:34,530
What's that reference to?

3304
04:31:34,530 --> 04:31:49,469
I don't know what that means.

3305
04:31:49,469 --> 04:31:59,680
There we go.

3306
04:31:59,680 --> 04:32:02,870
The reference to the Bible.

3307
04:32:02,909 --> 04:32:07,110
Sorry, I have not kept up with my Bible studies.

3308
04:32:07,110 --> 04:32:16,559
What is, it's a Prometheus is stole fire from the gods

3309
04:32:17,079 --> 04:32:18,879
and gave it to man.

3310
04:32:18,879 --> 04:32:19,799
He got punished for it.

3311
04:32:19,799 --> 04:32:21,239
I think he had to have his liver eaten

3312
04:32:21,239 --> 04:32:22,600
by a raven every day.

3313
04:32:29,620 --> 04:32:35,149
Well, that didn't happen.

3314
04:32:35,149 --> 04:32:37,870
Do you mean am I getting a lot of flack

3315
04:32:37,870 --> 04:32:40,629
from my family for leaking the recipe?

3316
04:32:40,629 --> 04:32:57,299
I think that's where you're going with that, right?

3317
04:32:57,299 --> 04:33:06,560
Ooh, that's a good one.

3318
04:33:06,560 --> 04:33:09,759
Hey, you do know that a secret family recipe

3319
04:33:09,759 --> 04:33:14,139
can start at any generation.

3320
04:33:14,139 --> 04:33:18,689
Who's to say it didn't start with me?

3321
04:33:18,689 --> 04:33:21,770
You think there's some great dear old great grandma

3322
04:33:21,770 --> 04:33:24,669
or grandpa that I got that from?

3323
04:33:24,669 --> 04:33:25,869
Who'd be starting here?

3324
04:33:25,869 --> 04:33:28,610
I am the great grandpa.

3325
04:33:28,610 --> 04:33:37,549
I am the secret recipe, you understand?

3326
04:33:37,549 --> 04:33:45,580
Gotta leave something, right?

3327
04:33:45,580 --> 04:33:50,009
I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures of me in chef outfits

3328
04:33:50,009 --> 04:33:51,610
just to make sure that this, you know,

3329
04:33:51,650 --> 04:33:52,450
they can look back and be like,

3330
04:33:52,450 --> 04:33:55,650
oh, great, great, great, great grandpa Jerma.

3331
04:33:55,650 --> 04:33:58,209
I mean, there's a lot of pictures of him in chef hats.

3332
04:33:58,209 --> 04:34:00,450
He must have been a chef of some kind.

3333
04:34:00,450 --> 04:34:08,740
Why would he take photos like this?

3334
04:34:08,740 --> 04:34:09,740
That's hard.

3335
04:34:09,740 --> 04:34:18,340
That one was really, really hard.

3336
04:34:18,340 --> 04:34:21,529
There's a ton of green screen footage of you.

3337
04:34:21,529 --> 04:34:22,770
That's fine.

3338
04:34:22,770 --> 04:34:25,779
That was in my younger years.

3339
04:34:25,779 --> 04:34:29,750
I'm gonna take these photos when I'm like 60.

3340
04:34:29,750 --> 04:34:41,139
Oh my goodness, what a disaster.

3341
04:34:41,139 --> 04:35:00,479
That was a nice song.

3342
04:35:00,479 --> 04:35:02,799
If I walked in and this is all here,

3343
04:35:02,799 --> 04:35:04,520
don't you think that the people that were working here

3344
04:35:04,520 --> 04:35:08,619
were moving?

3345
04:35:08,619 --> 04:35:15,849
They're like, oh, it's like this because they're moving soon.

3346
04:35:15,849 --> 04:35:17,369
This is pretty good Kickstarter music.

3347
04:35:17,369 --> 04:35:38,549
What do you mean?

3348
04:35:38,549 --> 04:35:40,150
Mr. Elberson, this is Steve Jackson's

3349
04:35:40,150 --> 04:35:41,950
Sorcery Enjoyers High Council.

3350
04:35:41,950 --> 04:35:44,669
That thing got removed in a second.

3351
04:35:44,669 --> 04:35:46,509
You can't post that more than once.

3352
04:35:46,509 --> 04:35:51,919
Although that doesn't get posted more than once.

3353
04:35:51,919 --> 04:35:57,650
I'm only gonna read that once.

3354
04:35:57,650 --> 04:35:58,729
It was different?

3355
04:35:58,729 --> 04:36:08,430
No, oh well.

3356
04:36:08,430 --> 04:36:10,029
You've asked this question like 30 times.

3357
04:36:10,029 --> 04:36:13,630
Do I eat sludge?

3358
04:36:13,630 --> 04:36:16,830
Well, that depends on your definition.

3359
04:36:16,830 --> 04:36:20,169
Is oatmeal sludge?

3360
04:36:20,209 --> 04:36:31,500
Let's break this down and talk about this.

3361
04:36:31,500 --> 04:36:53,470
And the answer is yes, then.

3362
04:36:53,470 --> 04:36:59,009
All right, speed this one up.

3363
04:36:59,009 --> 04:36:59,930
What about slop?

3364
04:37:02,180 --> 04:37:03,540
If sludge is oatmeal,

3365
04:37:03,540 --> 04:37:07,500
we're considering that oatmeal is like thicker.

3366
04:37:07,500 --> 04:37:09,619
Sludge to me is a little thicker.

3367
04:37:09,619 --> 04:37:11,709
Slop is runny.

3368
04:37:11,709 --> 04:37:18,590
What would be runny?

3369
04:37:18,590 --> 04:37:19,430
Chili?

3370
04:37:21,029 --> 04:37:28,240
Chili might fall more into the sludge category, I think.

3371
04:37:28,240 --> 04:37:37,430
I need this one.

3372
04:37:37,430 --> 04:37:38,869
And then three cones.

3373
04:37:38,869 --> 04:37:40,229
At least cones are like waffle.

3374
04:37:40,229 --> 04:37:53,279
What is this?

3375
04:37:54,979 --> 04:37:57,139
Chowder is kind of slop.

3376
04:37:57,139 --> 04:37:59,060
I could see that.

3377
04:37:59,060 --> 04:38:02,090
I could see how that, you could see that.

3378
04:38:02,090 --> 04:38:12,360
Cannoli?

3379
04:38:12,360 --> 04:38:18,540
There we are.

3380
04:38:18,540 --> 04:38:23,220
The oatmeal depends on consistency, yeah.

3381
04:38:23,220 --> 04:38:25,099
You know what I haven't had in a long time?

3382
04:38:25,099 --> 04:38:27,139
It's a good fish chowder.

3383
04:38:27,139 --> 04:38:29,419
Clam chowder, F.

3384
04:38:29,419 --> 04:38:32,180
Fish chowder, A+.

3385
04:38:32,180 --> 04:38:35,669
Corn chowder, B.

3386
04:38:35,669 --> 04:38:37,880
Clam chowder is an F for me.

3387
04:38:37,880 --> 04:38:39,520
Fish chowder is an S.

3388
04:38:39,520 --> 04:38:45,900
It's an A+.

3389
04:38:45,900 --> 04:38:49,319
I don't like clams.

3390
04:38:49,319 --> 04:38:51,040
I never was a fan of clams or oysters.

3391
04:38:51,040 --> 04:39:01,400
Anything in the shell, really, besides maybe crab.

3392
04:39:01,400 --> 04:39:02,799
Clams are too rubbery.

3393
04:39:02,799 --> 04:39:05,360
Yeah, I feel like, I don't like it.

3394
04:39:05,360 --> 04:39:12,549
It's too weird.

3395
04:39:12,549 --> 04:39:14,029
Clams are rubbery.

3396
04:39:14,029 --> 04:39:16,790
I don't, no, I don't like squid either, or octopus.

3397
04:39:16,790 --> 04:39:20,430
No, thanks.

3398
04:39:20,430 --> 04:39:21,790
If you're one of those people that goes,

3399
04:39:21,790 --> 04:39:26,299
hey, let's get a calamari for the table.

3400
04:39:26,299 --> 04:39:27,979
I always kind of feel like, fuck,

3401
04:39:27,979 --> 04:39:29,020
I'm not gonna eat any of that.

3402
04:39:29,020 --> 04:39:30,700
And people are gonna be, you're gonna be looking over,

3403
04:39:30,700 --> 04:39:33,459
hey, you want those, you want any pieces?

3404
04:39:33,459 --> 04:39:35,979
There's like five or six pieces of calamari left.

3405
04:39:35,979 --> 04:39:37,779
Like, no, you can eat it.

3406
04:39:37,779 --> 04:39:39,700
Well, I already had like seven or eight pieces.

3407
04:39:39,700 --> 04:39:43,099
I'm not, I wanna leave room for my entree.

3408
04:39:43,099 --> 04:40:01,119
Like, oh, oops.

3409
04:40:01,119 --> 04:40:03,299
I have eaten calamari before.

3410
04:40:03,299 --> 04:40:06,580
That was very, very, very, very good.

3411
04:40:06,580 --> 04:40:08,259
It was perfect.

3412
04:40:08,259 --> 04:40:10,380
But I've also eaten calamari before.

3413
04:40:10,380 --> 04:40:12,139
That made me want to never eat it ever again

3414
04:40:12,139 --> 04:40:13,380
for the rest of my life.

3415
04:40:13,380 --> 04:40:18,540
So I'm sorry, that's too much of a range for me.

3416
04:40:18,540 --> 04:40:35,580
It's just too much of a range.

3417
04:40:35,580 --> 04:40:36,419
Hey, hold on.

3418
04:40:40,020 --> 04:40:42,220
Dude, your stream really is a food podcast.

3419
04:40:42,220 --> 04:40:46,909
I could talk about food all day.

3420
04:40:46,909 --> 04:40:50,229
Don't be surprised if I like fucking retire

3421
04:40:50,229 --> 04:40:53,909
and I have like an old man food podcast.

3422
04:40:53,909 --> 04:40:57,909
Today, where I go and I tried this restaurant today

3423
04:40:57,909 --> 04:41:02,430
and it was called Spaghetti for Two or whatever.

3424
04:41:02,430 --> 04:41:03,349
And it was delicious.

3425
04:41:03,349 --> 04:41:06,180
And let me tell you what I ordered.

3426
04:41:06,180 --> 04:41:07,419
Would you watch that?

3427
04:41:07,419 --> 04:41:13,000
Would you listen to it?

3428
04:41:13,000 --> 04:41:15,759
I will say I was not a huge fan

3429
04:41:15,799 --> 04:41:17,919
of the crust of the bread.

3430
04:41:17,919 --> 04:41:20,159
The crust of the bread to me needs to be brown

3431
04:41:20,159 --> 04:41:22,520
on the underneath, but soft on the top.

3432
04:41:22,520 --> 04:41:26,119
And it was fucking disgusting that they didn't do that.

3433
04:41:26,119 --> 04:41:29,830
And I will never go back to this place ever again.

3434
04:41:29,830 --> 04:41:32,389
The tomato sauce was high quality.

3435
04:41:33,869 --> 04:41:36,110
Server didn't remember my name.

3436
04:41:36,110 --> 04:41:38,990
So they are obviously, I'm gonna have to give minus

3437
04:41:38,990 --> 04:41:50,389
a full star for that one.

3438
04:41:50,389 --> 04:41:53,900
Wait, that's wrong.

3439
04:41:53,900 --> 04:42:05,810
It's done.

3440
04:42:05,810 --> 04:42:11,849
What, it wasn't mixed enough?

3441
04:42:11,849 --> 04:42:14,810
Angry grumpy spoiled old man rants about food

3442
04:42:14,810 --> 04:42:19,040
and dies of a heart attack in the middle of the podcast.

3443
04:42:19,040 --> 04:42:20,080
That's like sad.

3444
04:42:20,080 --> 04:42:22,479
I don't wanna think about that.

3445
04:42:22,479 --> 04:42:32,659
I don't wanna have that thought in my head.

3446
04:42:32,659 --> 04:42:35,680
And when I went there, you don't understand.

3447
04:42:35,680 --> 04:42:38,900
I dropped my napkin on the ground

3448
04:42:38,900 --> 04:42:42,860
and it wasn't replaced within one minute.

3449
04:42:47,319 --> 04:42:49,040
I don't think I wanna live that life, right?

3450
04:42:49,040 --> 04:42:56,849
No, I don't know.

3451
04:42:56,849 --> 04:43:03,250
This person's wanted this Calypso coconut thing.

3452
04:43:03,290 --> 04:43:04,290
Should I go out there and just say,

3453
04:43:04,290 --> 04:43:05,729
hey, listen, I'm sorry.

3454
04:43:05,729 --> 04:43:08,000
I don't know how to make that.

3455
04:43:08,000 --> 04:43:12,119
I know you saw some like TikTok video of the secret menu,

3456
04:43:12,119 --> 04:43:19,259
but I don't know what the fuck this is.

3457
04:43:19,259 --> 04:43:34,740
Okay, I think I do know what it is.

3458
04:43:34,740 --> 04:43:35,580
There we go.

3459
04:43:46,209 --> 04:43:47,970
Remember you use TikTok?

3460
04:43:47,970 --> 04:43:52,319
No, I just pretend to to fit in.

3461
04:43:52,319 --> 04:43:53,880
I have to be like aware of it.

3462
04:43:53,880 --> 04:44:05,259
Come on.

3463
04:44:05,259 --> 04:44:06,139
Anybody else in line?

3464
04:44:06,139 --> 04:44:08,580
No.

3465
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:14,540
All right, so it's blue coconut, blue sprinkles.

3466
04:44:14,540 --> 04:44:15,979
This thing does look really good though.

3467
04:44:15,979 --> 04:44:35,740
I would eat this one.

3468
04:44:35,900 --> 04:44:38,060
I've been really too timid with that.

3469
04:44:38,060 --> 04:44:46,360
That was almost a perfect four.

3470
04:44:46,360 --> 04:44:56,700
This one looks really good.

3471
04:44:56,700 --> 04:45:09,740
That's my best one yet, I think.

3472
04:45:09,740 --> 04:45:12,630
What about deep dish pizza?

3473
04:45:12,630 --> 04:45:14,700
I like a thinner crust.

3474
04:45:14,700 --> 04:45:19,939
Deep dish pizza to me is a lasagna.

3475
04:45:19,939 --> 04:45:21,779
Lasagna is delicious.

3476
04:45:21,779 --> 04:45:24,799
Deep dish pizza is delicious,

3477
04:45:24,799 --> 04:45:31,819
but I prefer a thinner crust.

3478
04:45:31,819 --> 04:45:33,860
If you could preserve any existing food menu items

3479
04:45:33,860 --> 04:45:35,299
so that it would be available forever,

3480
04:45:35,299 --> 04:45:36,139
what would you pick?

3481
04:45:36,139 --> 04:45:38,229
Cheese agridita crunch from Taco Bell.

3482
04:45:38,229 --> 04:46:00,540
The aliens would have to eat that at some point.

3483
04:46:00,540 --> 04:46:04,220
You know how a lot of times I'm a little bit older

3484
04:46:04,220 --> 04:46:07,139
and maybe some of you are also in this after 30

3485
04:46:07,180 --> 04:46:09,909
or even if you're in your mid to late 20s.

3486
04:46:09,909 --> 04:46:12,349
You know there's that food item that you look back,

3487
04:46:12,349 --> 04:46:14,669
oh my God, all the nostalgia videos of,

3488
04:46:14,669 --> 04:46:16,720
imagine if this was still a thing.

3489
04:46:16,720 --> 04:46:19,180
I am so glad that the cheesy agridita crunch

3490
04:46:19,180 --> 04:46:22,740
from when I was like 13 to all the way to now,

3491
04:46:22,740 --> 04:46:24,470
it's been the exact same.

3492
04:46:24,470 --> 04:46:25,709
I'm so happy that I don't have to think

3493
04:46:25,709 --> 04:46:29,369
about where that went.

3494
04:46:29,369 --> 04:46:30,569
That is one of those items

3495
04:46:30,569 --> 04:46:32,770
that if it was gone 10 years ago,

3496
04:46:32,770 --> 04:46:34,169
I would be desperately talking

3497
04:46:34,169 --> 04:46:39,189
about how much I wish I could eat one,

3498
04:46:39,189 --> 04:46:40,549
but I don't have to think like that

3499
04:46:40,549 --> 04:46:45,279
because it's available and I'm gonna fail this one.

3500
04:46:45,279 --> 04:47:00,509
Good luck, excuse me.

3501
04:47:00,509 --> 04:47:16,819
I almost have it, come on man.

3502
04:47:16,819 --> 04:47:23,200
There's not enough fucking time to do this.

3503
04:47:23,200 --> 04:47:28,840
I got it, okay good.

3504
04:47:28,840 --> 04:47:31,759
Calm down with the come on mans.

3505
04:47:31,759 --> 04:47:36,580
Am I doing that a lot?

3506
04:47:36,580 --> 04:47:52,520
Do I say come on man a lot?

3507
04:47:52,520 --> 04:48:03,610
A and B button.

3508
04:48:03,610 --> 04:48:06,349
Oh, this is all the customers.

3509
04:48:06,349 --> 04:48:18,180
Who have I served the most?

3510
04:48:18,180 --> 04:48:24,590
I feel like I've served way more than this.

3511
04:48:24,590 --> 04:48:40,319
Maybe not, okay.

3512
04:48:40,319 --> 04:48:49,830
I wanna get this hat off.

3513
04:48:49,830 --> 04:48:53,099
Willy Wonka chocolate factory.

3514
04:48:53,099 --> 04:49:21,689
Willy Wonka wear purple.

3515
04:49:21,689 --> 04:49:24,049
The Willy Wonka stream is something else

3516
04:49:24,049 --> 04:49:26,790
I really wish I was able to do at some point.

3517
04:49:26,790 --> 04:49:44,569
It would have been so much fun.

3518
04:49:44,569 --> 04:49:47,819
There's still time.

3519
04:49:47,860 --> 04:49:51,700
Yeah, but I really, you know,

3520
04:49:51,700 --> 04:49:55,939
you're talking like you can't do it now.

3521
04:49:55,939 --> 04:50:22,709
No, but no.

3522
04:50:22,709 --> 04:50:36,009
Did I do this one right?

3523
04:50:36,009 --> 04:50:39,860
What a health and safety nightmare.

3524
04:50:39,860 --> 04:50:41,259
Well, all right, let me,

3525
04:50:41,259 --> 04:50:43,819
okay, let me be realistic.

3526
04:50:43,819 --> 04:50:46,580
A lot of times I'll come up with something that I wanna do

3527
04:50:46,580 --> 04:50:47,979
and then realize to do it right

3528
04:50:47,979 --> 04:50:52,729
will be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

3529
04:50:52,729 --> 04:50:55,650
So I go, oh, okay, that sounds fun.

3530
04:50:55,650 --> 04:50:57,419
How do I do that?

3531
04:50:57,419 --> 04:50:58,939
How do I be able to like afford that

3532
04:50:58,939 --> 04:51:00,419
and not lose everything?

3533
04:51:14,299 --> 04:51:34,450
Oh, and also stuff like that.

3534
04:51:34,450 --> 04:51:39,279
I think the reason why a lot of you like the kind of show

3535
04:51:39,279 --> 04:51:42,740
in quote streams or the event type streams

3536
04:51:42,740 --> 04:51:45,619
is because I'm doing those when I really want to.

3537
04:51:45,619 --> 04:51:46,900
And it's like, I am super excited.

3538
04:51:46,900 --> 04:51:47,860
I'm super passionate about it.

3539
04:51:47,860 --> 04:51:50,849
I wanna go for it as hard as I can.

3540
04:51:50,849 --> 04:51:52,250
I think that's probably why

3541
04:51:52,250 --> 04:51:54,770
is they don't have to happen all the time.

3542
04:51:54,770 --> 04:51:57,889
It's not something, oh, wow, I can't like every 30 days,

3543
04:51:57,889 --> 04:52:01,240
there's gotta be something fucking crazy.

3544
04:52:01,240 --> 04:52:05,259
I wanna steer away from that

3545
04:52:05,299 --> 04:52:08,220
because I feel like over the last year,

3546
04:52:08,220 --> 04:52:17,720
I've really tried to do that.

3547
04:52:17,720 --> 04:52:21,810
And you're watching right now,

3548
04:52:21,810 --> 04:52:28,720
I think part of the stream that I was maybe missing

3549
04:52:28,720 --> 04:52:52,240
for me at least.

3550
04:52:52,240 --> 04:52:57,130
Just make the smoothies, man, it's all right.

3551
04:52:57,130 --> 04:52:59,049
You should do whatever makes you happy.

3552
04:52:59,049 --> 04:53:05,450
This makes me happy right now.

3553
04:53:05,450 --> 04:53:06,970
And who knows, I don't know.

3554
04:53:06,970 --> 04:53:08,569
There are other things that are making me really happy.

3555
04:53:08,569 --> 04:53:12,490
Obviously the Grotto Beast project is a lot of work

3556
04:53:12,490 --> 04:53:14,090
and a lot of time went into that.

3557
04:53:14,090 --> 04:53:16,049
There's a lot of things to still show.

3558
04:53:17,689 --> 04:53:18,970
So that's really exciting.

3559
04:53:20,500 --> 04:53:27,139
But I gotta be all in, I have to be all in.

3560
04:53:27,139 --> 04:53:34,090
And I definitely think it's best to pull back.

3561
04:53:34,090 --> 04:53:35,409
This is correct, right?

3562
04:53:35,409 --> 04:53:45,439
No, it's not, throw it away.

3563
04:53:45,439 --> 04:53:47,439
I didn't even start that, wait, what is this one?

3564
04:53:47,439 --> 04:53:55,270
Oh shit, hold on, this one's easy.

3565
04:53:55,270 --> 04:53:58,110
Really like these no cam chill streams.

3566
04:53:58,110 --> 04:54:01,200
Yeah, so do I.

3567
04:54:01,200 --> 04:54:09,830
So do I.

3568
04:54:09,830 --> 04:54:14,849
We have elementary school dork taste in games.

3569
04:54:14,849 --> 04:54:17,610
This is, isn't this like half of everybody in this chat's

3570
04:54:17,650 --> 04:54:22,439
like favorite, one of like favorite Flash series?

3571
04:54:22,439 --> 04:54:28,590
I thought I was being a pleaser today.

3572
04:54:28,590 --> 04:54:31,340
Okay, is this one?

3573
04:54:42,259 --> 04:54:45,479
This is still Club Penguin, this is great.

3574
04:54:45,479 --> 04:54:47,560
This is very inoffensive music.

3575
04:54:47,560 --> 04:54:52,919
It just feels good to play it.

3576
04:54:52,919 --> 04:54:59,689
Just hanging out in the background.

3577
04:54:59,689 --> 04:55:03,130
All right, I need two mediums.

3578
04:55:03,130 --> 04:55:10,590
Strawberry and then strawberry lemonade.

3579
04:55:10,590 --> 04:55:14,220
This is Wii Sports music, it kind of is.

3580
04:55:14,220 --> 04:55:24,310
All right, it's cake, cake and blue.

3581
04:55:24,349 --> 04:55:26,970
You thought about doing some more small scale stuff?

3582
04:55:26,970 --> 04:55:31,599
Yes, you'll see.

3583
04:55:31,599 --> 04:55:52,220
The answer to that question is yes.

3584
04:55:52,220 --> 04:55:58,490
Cause I gotta be careful.

3585
04:55:58,490 --> 04:56:00,650
I can get really, really into stuff

3586
04:56:00,650 --> 04:56:04,639
and then be like, wow, I just only wanna do that.

3587
04:56:04,639 --> 04:56:07,779
And then I could get myself into a lot of trouble

3588
04:56:07,779 --> 04:56:14,610
if I don't be careful with that.

3589
04:56:14,610 --> 04:56:23,500
There we go.

3590
04:56:23,500 --> 04:56:26,299
But when I say trouble, I mean,

3591
04:56:26,299 --> 04:56:28,979
doing a bunch of streams that are big, big, big, bigger,

3592
04:56:28,979 --> 04:56:30,500
it's gotta be bigger, it's gotta be crazier,

3593
04:56:30,500 --> 04:56:33,459
it's gotta be even more ridiculous.

3594
04:56:33,459 --> 04:56:37,139
I mean, I'll just start blowing money left and right.

3595
04:56:37,139 --> 04:56:43,979
And sponsors can help, but it's never,

3596
04:56:43,979 --> 04:56:47,060
I obviously wanna make sure that,

3597
04:56:47,060 --> 04:56:48,779
is this the, did I do this wrong?

3598
04:56:48,779 --> 04:56:59,090
No, this is correct.

3599
04:56:59,090 --> 04:57:01,290
Have you lost passion over the years for streaming?

3600
04:57:01,290 --> 04:57:07,299
No, I don't think that's true.

3601
04:57:07,299 --> 04:57:10,380
I think, cause I've been doing it for long enough

3602
04:57:10,380 --> 04:57:15,479
that I can kind of cyclically go through different phases

3603
04:57:15,479 --> 04:57:18,319
and keep myself interested.

3604
04:57:18,319 --> 04:57:20,599
So that, I mean, that's really important.

3605
04:57:20,639 --> 04:57:52,860
What, oh, sprinkles, coconut, and then that.

3606
04:57:52,860 --> 04:57:54,819
This dude can't remember a color from more than two seconds.

3607
04:57:54,819 --> 04:58:13,060
No, I can't, it's true.

3608
04:58:13,060 --> 04:58:17,470
Level 13, yes.

3609
04:58:17,470 --> 04:58:19,119
What about Toontown?

3610
04:58:19,119 --> 04:58:22,990
I was gonna play Toontown a while ago, just never did.

3611
04:58:28,099 --> 04:58:42,619
There was a reason why it didn't, I forget what it was.

3612
04:58:42,619 --> 04:58:55,299
No, you would crash Toontown so bad.

3613
04:58:55,299 --> 04:59:02,900
Maybe the end, maybe that is what happened.

3614
04:59:02,900 --> 04:59:04,459
Do you ever get burnt out?

3615
04:59:04,459 --> 04:59:09,560
Um, yeah.

3616
04:59:09,560 --> 04:59:11,970
That's a hard one to answer because I,

3617
04:59:12,009 --> 04:59:15,110
I know the joke here is that I don't stream that often,

3618
04:59:15,110 --> 04:59:16,630
but that's very specifically to make sure

3619
04:59:16,630 --> 04:59:27,500
that does not happen.

3620
04:59:27,500 --> 04:59:31,830
What was that?

3621
04:59:31,830 --> 04:59:33,349
Like I, sometimes I might just disappear

3622
04:59:33,349 --> 04:59:35,110
for like four or five straight days.

3623
04:59:35,110 --> 04:59:44,830
That happens pretty frequently here.

3624
04:59:44,830 --> 04:59:45,990
Get out of the way.

3625
04:59:45,990 --> 04:59:46,810
How is this fair?

3626
04:59:46,810 --> 04:59:48,909
There's been no coins on the bottom or top

3627
04:59:48,909 --> 05:00:05,180
and they've been hogging the middle.

3628
05:00:05,180 --> 05:00:11,900
When are you gonna finally retire?

3629
05:00:11,900 --> 05:00:15,900
I will tell you, retirement on this channel

3630
05:00:15,900 --> 05:00:17,340
is gonna be soft.

3631
05:00:17,340 --> 05:00:29,750
It would be a soft retirement.

3632
05:00:29,750 --> 05:00:31,349
And what does that mean by soft retirement?

3633
05:00:31,349 --> 05:00:35,549
That means I'm not gonna stop.

3634
05:00:35,549 --> 05:00:42,919
I don't think I ever will be able to.

3635
05:00:42,919 --> 05:00:45,689
Cryptic Andy?

3636
05:00:45,689 --> 05:00:46,549
No, I'm just saying like,

3637
05:00:46,549 --> 05:00:47,970
it's not gonna be a case where it's like,

3638
05:00:47,970 --> 05:00:50,979
oh, by the way, I am retired.

3639
05:00:50,979 --> 05:00:52,299
Twitch is deleted, YouTube is deleted,

3640
05:00:52,299 --> 05:00:54,180
and my Twitter's gone and you never hear,

3641
05:00:54,180 --> 05:01:10,319
I literally never, you don't hear from me ever again.

3642
05:01:10,319 --> 05:01:17,880
You should transition to Battletoads.

3643
05:01:17,880 --> 05:01:18,799
Battletoads is sick.

3644
05:01:18,799 --> 05:01:34,560
That's not a bad idea.

3645
05:01:34,560 --> 05:01:36,970
No, I'm such a fucking clown.

3646
05:01:36,970 --> 05:01:38,930
It would be embarrassing

3647
05:01:38,930 --> 05:01:41,459
because I would be like, oh, I'm retired.

3648
05:01:41,459 --> 05:01:42,540
And then like a month later,

3649
05:01:42,540 --> 05:01:46,340
Durba is coming out of retirement to do this.

3650
05:01:46,340 --> 05:02:01,340
No, we'll call it a soft retirement whenever that is.

3651
05:02:01,340 --> 05:02:03,180
I gotta have my food podcast eventually.

3652
05:02:03,180 --> 05:02:17,540
Come on.

3653
05:02:17,540 --> 05:02:18,619
Did I do this one wrong?

3654
05:02:18,619 --> 05:02:20,240
Is it the wrong size?

3655
05:02:20,240 --> 05:02:27,509
No, that's good.

3656
05:02:27,509 --> 05:02:30,569
Will we know when the soft retirement has started?

3657
05:02:30,569 --> 05:02:33,279
Oh yeah, absolutely.

3658
05:02:33,279 --> 05:02:35,159
I wouldn't keep you guys completely in the dark over that.

3659
05:02:35,159 --> 05:02:44,029
That'd be weird.

3660
05:02:44,029 --> 05:02:44,869
We got a new ingredient.

3661
05:02:44,869 --> 05:02:45,709
Oh, Pog.

3662
05:02:49,549 --> 05:02:57,720
It's crispy dots, whatever they are.

3663
05:02:57,720 --> 05:02:59,159
Monthly retirement conversation?

3664
05:02:59,200 --> 05:03:00,439
That's not true.

3665
05:03:00,439 --> 05:03:02,000
That's not true.

3666
05:03:02,000 --> 05:03:02,840
We have not talked about this

3667
05:03:02,840 --> 05:03:05,319
in probably at least four to six months.

3668
05:03:05,319 --> 05:03:21,860
That's not true.

3669
05:03:21,860 --> 05:03:24,020
Thoughts on Dippin' Dots ice cream of the future.

3670
05:03:24,020 --> 05:03:26,500
S plus.

3671
05:03:26,500 --> 05:03:31,259
The first time I ate Dippin' Dots, I was a kid,

3672
05:03:31,259 --> 05:03:34,409
and I think my eyes were gonna bug out of my head.

3673
05:03:34,409 --> 05:03:40,909
It was one of the greatest experiences of my entire life.

3674
05:03:40,909 --> 05:03:45,540
If there was a video camera back then,

3675
05:03:45,540 --> 05:03:46,979
and like my mother took,

3676
05:03:46,979 --> 05:03:48,659
or like my parents took a video of me

3677
05:03:48,659 --> 05:03:50,709
eating Dippin' Dots for the first time,

3678
05:03:50,709 --> 05:03:53,400
it probably would be a meme right now.

3679
05:03:53,720 --> 05:03:57,880
A decade, two decades, three decades later.

3680
05:03:57,880 --> 05:03:58,720
It'd be one of those like,

3681
05:03:58,720 --> 05:04:04,060
look at this little kid does something really funny.

3682
05:04:04,060 --> 05:04:18,319
Okay, I need a large and medium.

3683
05:04:18,319 --> 05:04:21,040
Chocolate.

3684
05:04:21,040 --> 05:04:23,319
You lied about watching Mob Psycho 100.

3685
05:04:23,319 --> 05:04:25,360
Oh shit, somebody actually remembered that.

3686
05:04:27,830 --> 05:04:52,299
When's your birthday?

3687
05:04:52,299 --> 05:04:57,819
The Dippin' Dots kid finally plays Papa's Freezeria.

3688
05:04:57,819 --> 05:05:05,229
That's me.

3689
05:05:05,229 --> 05:05:12,060
The Dippin' Dots kid.

3690
05:05:12,060 --> 05:05:16,619
All of my merchandise would have to be like that picture

3691
05:05:16,619 --> 05:05:24,349
or that screenshot of my reaction to eating the Dippin' Dots

3692
05:05:24,349 --> 05:05:25,189
at all the conventions

3693
05:05:25,189 --> 05:05:28,509
that everyone would want me to do the face.

3694
05:05:28,509 --> 05:05:30,150
Like do the brain freeze face.

3695
05:05:40,860 --> 05:05:43,369
Dippin' Dots tier list.

3696
05:05:43,369 --> 05:05:45,250
I don't, can you even buy Dippin' Dots?

3697
05:05:45,250 --> 05:05:46,500
Do they even?

3698
05:05:46,500 --> 05:05:49,619
To me, Dippin' Dots are in a machine in a mall.

3699
05:05:49,619 --> 05:06:00,209
There's no story, where do you get them?

3700
05:06:00,209 --> 05:06:02,130
All right, what do I gotta say?

3701
05:06:02,130 --> 05:06:06,860
What's this?

3702
05:06:06,860 --> 05:06:10,500
This one here.

3703
05:06:10,500 --> 05:06:14,389
Get them online and deliver them?

3704
05:06:14,389 --> 05:06:17,310
How do they, is it packaged in like a freezer?

3705
05:06:17,310 --> 05:06:18,830
How do they make sure it gets there?

3706
05:06:18,869 --> 05:06:23,860
It's still being perfect.

3707
05:06:23,860 --> 05:06:25,299
But yeah, this is not just something you get

3708
05:06:25,299 --> 05:06:35,930
on an amusement park or at a mall.

3709
05:06:35,930 --> 05:06:38,720
They ship with dry ice.

3710
05:06:38,720 --> 05:06:47,349
Really?

3711
05:06:47,349 --> 05:06:48,189
They have a system.

3712
05:06:48,189 --> 05:06:51,020
You think they're amateurs or something?

3713
05:06:51,020 --> 05:06:52,659
I mean, you don't create ice cream like that

3714
05:06:52,659 --> 05:07:01,200
and not know kind of what's going on.

3715
05:07:01,200 --> 05:07:03,500
The Dippin' Dots CEO could run for president.

3716
05:07:03,500 --> 05:07:04,979
And I'd be like, all right.

3717
05:07:04,979 --> 05:07:06,810
All right, I think he understands.

3718
05:07:06,810 --> 05:07:14,099
I think he understands.

3719
05:07:14,099 --> 05:07:22,049
This guy can lead us or whoever they are.

3720
05:07:22,049 --> 05:07:24,889
Dippin' Dots C, weekly Dippin' Dots rant.

3721
05:07:25,250 --> 05:07:43,779
This is the first time I've ever spoke about this.

3722
05:07:43,779 --> 05:07:45,259
You're delusional, dude.

3723
05:07:51,139 --> 05:07:53,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3724
05:07:53,500 --> 05:07:57,060
When you tell him to use the gumball machine?

3725
05:07:57,060 --> 05:08:07,869
Oh, fuck, I have to play.

3726
05:08:07,869 --> 05:08:09,110
The best thing about Dippin' Dots

3727
05:08:09,110 --> 05:08:12,740
was being at an amusement park, it was.

3728
05:08:12,740 --> 05:08:15,919
And you could just see the air coming off of it.

3729
05:08:15,919 --> 05:08:17,799
Whatever it was, CO2, nitrogen.

3730
05:08:17,799 --> 05:08:19,119
I don't even know what it is.

3731
05:08:19,119 --> 05:08:21,880
But when they take that shit out of the container,

3732
05:08:21,880 --> 05:08:23,639
they do the big scoop, big scoop,

3733
05:08:23,639 --> 05:08:24,479
and they hand it to you.

3734
05:08:24,479 --> 05:08:27,830
And this thing is smoking.

3735
05:08:27,830 --> 05:08:31,779
Ah, you can't replace that.

3736
05:08:31,819 --> 05:08:35,689
Join me for another amazing afternoon

3737
05:08:35,689 --> 05:08:41,029
called Grandpa Jeremy's Sweets and Treats.

3738
05:08:41,029 --> 05:08:43,189
This episode, we're gonna be talking about ice cream

3739
05:08:43,189 --> 05:08:44,430
and how delicious it is.

3740
05:08:44,430 --> 05:08:48,860
And when I was younger, different experiences I had.

3741
05:08:48,860 --> 05:08:50,779
One time I wanted.

3742
05:08:50,779 --> 05:08:55,029
Yeah, it's gonna happen eventually.

3743
05:08:55,029 --> 05:09:04,610
This is fun.

3744
05:09:04,610 --> 05:09:05,569
You got two orders.

3745
05:09:05,569 --> 05:09:25,950
I know, I'm going.

3746
05:09:25,950 --> 05:09:30,830
And make sure to get my cookbook.

3747
05:09:30,830 --> 05:09:33,479
Eggs and such.

3748
05:09:33,479 --> 05:09:36,060
It's four pages long.

3749
05:09:36,060 --> 05:09:37,619
It's my secret recipe for,

3750
05:09:40,599 --> 05:09:42,979
I don't fucking remember.

3751
05:09:42,979 --> 05:09:45,659
And then there's a big forward by me telling you

3752
05:09:45,659 --> 05:09:50,029
that they're really happy that you downloaded their book.

3753
05:09:50,029 --> 05:09:56,169
And then my favorite songs are on the last one.

3754
05:09:56,169 --> 05:10:03,799
Only two recipes in the book.

3755
05:10:03,799 --> 05:10:07,000
We're gonna try egg flavored Dippin' Dots today.

3756
05:10:07,000 --> 05:10:12,529
And they are fucking disgusting.

3757
05:10:12,529 --> 05:10:13,369
Oh no, I better be careful.

3758
05:10:13,369 --> 05:10:14,970
Then that channel turns into like,

3759
05:10:14,970 --> 05:10:17,569
like cinnamon challenges and stuff.

3760
05:10:17,569 --> 05:10:19,419
Uh oh.

3761
05:10:19,419 --> 05:10:22,979
Today on Food Sweet Treats with Grandpa.

3762
05:10:22,979 --> 05:10:30,020
I'm gonna eat the one chip hot fucking chip challenge today.

3763
05:10:30,099 --> 05:10:43,369
Oh, oh no.

3764
05:10:43,369 --> 05:10:45,090
Somebody said, bro, why are people tipping you

3765
05:10:45,090 --> 05:10:46,169
this much for ice cream?

3766
05:10:46,169 --> 05:10:48,009
I don't know, they're being like generous.

3767
05:10:48,009 --> 05:10:52,610
I don't know.

3768
05:10:52,610 --> 05:10:53,569
How much are they tipping?

3769
05:10:53,569 --> 05:11:02,770
It's like a few bucks, five bucks.

3770
05:11:02,770 --> 05:11:05,009
You're doing body language with the camera off, aren't you?

3771
05:11:05,009 --> 05:11:06,450
I mean, yeah, cause I'm talking

3772
05:11:06,450 --> 05:11:19,369
and people talk and they move their arms.

3773
05:11:19,369 --> 05:11:24,599
$13 tip, that's a pretty, that's a pretty good tip.

3774
05:11:24,639 --> 05:11:26,270
$13 bucks.

3775
05:11:26,270 --> 05:11:43,869
How much are you, what are we selling these for?

3776
05:11:43,869 --> 05:12:01,750
That guy loves ice cream.

3777
05:12:01,750 --> 05:12:05,299
Nice.

3778
05:12:05,299 --> 05:12:07,330
Have you played this for five hours?

3779
05:12:07,330 --> 05:12:09,470
This game's a classic.

3780
05:12:09,470 --> 05:12:12,310
And I don't know, we've just been talking,

3781
05:12:12,310 --> 05:12:13,310
chilling out, talking.

3782
05:12:13,310 --> 05:12:14,509
Well, I've been talking.

3783
05:12:14,509 --> 05:12:17,139
You've been listening.

3784
05:12:17,139 --> 05:12:19,740
Don't ever mistake that.

3785
05:12:19,740 --> 05:12:29,369
Don't ever mistake that.

3786
05:12:29,369 --> 05:12:30,209
Why did I do that?

3787
05:12:30,209 --> 05:12:47,759
I was like aiming over there.

3788
05:12:47,759 --> 05:13:09,130
There's way too much stuff in this restaurant.

3789
05:13:09,130 --> 05:13:12,259
All right, let's do one more night, one more day.

3790
05:13:12,259 --> 05:13:13,779
And then I'll probably call it there.

3791
05:13:13,779 --> 05:13:15,849
I wanna get some food.

3792
05:13:15,849 --> 05:13:29,060
Ooh, new topping.

3793
05:13:29,060 --> 05:13:30,340
I'll be back tomorrow, don't worry.

3794
05:13:30,340 --> 05:13:45,639
We're starting earlier tomorrow anyways.

3795
05:13:45,639 --> 05:13:53,250
It's good.

3796
05:13:53,250 --> 05:13:54,090
What are we doing tomorrow?

3797
05:13:54,090 --> 05:14:00,689
We are watching old 90s commercials.

3798
05:14:00,689 --> 05:14:04,569
And then on Sunday,

3799
05:14:04,569 --> 05:14:25,900
we're gonna play the House Flipper DLC, Farm DLC.

3800
05:14:25,900 --> 05:14:32,229
Very interested.

3801
05:14:32,229 --> 05:14:43,459
Yeah, we got some fun stuff to do.

3802
05:14:43,459 --> 05:15:01,930
Chocolate and cherry.

3803
05:15:01,930 --> 05:15:04,340
Can you see how tall the whipped cream can go?

3804
05:15:04,340 --> 05:15:07,680
Yeah, before I, I'll go and mess around in the other boat.

3805
05:15:07,680 --> 05:15:18,750
I have plenty more ingredients now.

3806
05:15:18,750 --> 05:15:19,830
This is, ready?

3807
05:15:19,830 --> 05:15:29,340
Oh, almost.

3808
05:15:29,340 --> 05:15:31,880
What is this stuff here?

3809
05:15:31,880 --> 05:15:48,430
Cherry sauce or something?

3810
05:15:48,430 --> 05:15:51,029
Blood.

3811
05:15:51,509 --> 05:15:55,000
There's a five-star customer now.

3812
05:15:55,000 --> 05:15:59,610
I've got at least three or four five-star customers.

3813
05:15:59,610 --> 05:16:00,650
Can you do a doy doy doy?

3814
05:16:00,650 --> 05:16:02,740
We've been good, yep.

3815
05:16:02,740 --> 05:16:05,919
Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.

3816
05:16:05,919 --> 05:16:07,119
I can't do it anymore.

3817
05:16:07,119 --> 05:16:09,119
Doy, doy, doy, doy, doy, doy.

3818
05:16:09,119 --> 05:16:26,119
I can do it a little bit.

3819
05:16:26,119 --> 05:16:37,479
I used to be disgusting at the doy doy doy.

3820
05:16:37,479 --> 05:16:40,470
Other people have tried to match me doing it,

3821
05:16:40,470 --> 05:17:02,299
but it's just, no one could even come close back in the day.

3822
05:17:02,299 --> 05:17:09,580
That's probably what I'm most known for.

3823
05:17:09,580 --> 05:17:11,819
Oh no, I'm definitely most known for burp puking

3824
05:17:11,819 --> 05:17:14,080
and swallowing it.

3825
05:17:14,080 --> 05:17:19,479
That was like my claim to fame from like five years ago.

3826
05:17:19,479 --> 05:17:34,490
Okay, this shit is not even right.

3827
05:17:34,490 --> 05:17:50,029
Oh, I remember when I got called out so bad.

3828
05:17:50,029 --> 05:17:53,110
There was a point a few years ago where somebody said,

3829
05:17:53,110 --> 05:17:55,270
hey dude, you know you keep doing the like,

3830
05:17:55,270 --> 05:17:56,869
I'm gonna puke and then swallow it thing?

3831
05:17:56,869 --> 05:17:58,790
And I was like, no way.

3832
05:17:58,790 --> 05:18:00,189
I've done it once.

3833
05:18:00,189 --> 05:18:01,990
And I think they came with receipts

3834
05:18:01,990 --> 05:18:03,750
and they were like five different times that I did it

3835
05:18:03,750 --> 05:18:07,430
over the course of like six months.

3836
05:18:07,430 --> 05:18:17,130
It was a thing that I did all the time, apparently.

3837
05:18:17,169 --> 05:18:31,299
Hey, I was pretty good at it.

3838
05:18:31,299 --> 05:18:47,639
Coconut, still another order.

3839
05:18:47,639 --> 05:19:04,849
I was mixed for way too long.

3840
05:19:04,849 --> 05:19:11,110
Hey, how often do you actually puke?

3841
05:19:11,110 --> 05:19:14,310
I haven't, I mean, this is kind of a gross conversation,

3842
05:19:14,310 --> 05:19:16,159
throw that away.

3843
05:19:17,400 --> 05:19:18,240
It's been a pretty long time.

3844
05:19:18,240 --> 05:19:30,659
I actually don't remember.

3845
05:19:30,659 --> 05:19:31,939
Well, that's not true.

3846
05:19:31,939 --> 05:19:35,479
I remember Holly and I went out one night

3847
05:19:35,479 --> 05:19:38,319
and we ate a bunch of pizza.

3848
05:19:38,319 --> 05:19:42,740
This is recent and we got an Uber home.

3849
05:19:45,919 --> 05:19:47,599
It was like, I feel like it was the way

3850
05:19:47,599 --> 05:19:48,639
that the pizza was settled

3851
05:19:48,639 --> 05:19:50,560
and the way the car was being driven.

3852
05:19:50,560 --> 05:19:51,799
And I was like, I don't feel good.

3853
05:19:51,799 --> 05:19:53,700
And I puked.

3854
05:19:53,700 --> 05:20:02,689
Yeah, no, that happened.

3855
05:20:02,689 --> 05:20:04,209
No, no, not in, no, no, no.

3856
05:20:04,209 --> 05:20:06,369
This is like well after like,

3857
05:20:06,369 --> 05:20:09,630
this is well after being out of the car.

3858
05:20:09,630 --> 05:20:14,369
Not in the car, no, well after,

3859
05:20:14,369 --> 05:20:26,189
at least I'd say at least 15 to 20 minutes later.

3860
05:20:26,189 --> 05:20:28,750
It was like the pizza just was sitting so strangely

3861
05:20:28,750 --> 05:20:32,639
and I don't know, something about being,

3862
05:20:32,639 --> 05:20:36,610
maybe I got like a little car sick or something.

3863
05:20:36,610 --> 05:20:40,189
Is that, that can happen to me sometimes

3864
05:20:40,189 --> 05:20:50,680
depending on where I am in the car.

3865
05:20:50,680 --> 05:20:52,720
No, I didn't puke in an Uber.

3866
05:20:52,720 --> 05:20:56,959
Guys, what are you talking about?

3867
05:20:56,959 --> 05:21:08,639
I puked like an hour later after being out of the car.

3868
05:21:08,639 --> 05:21:16,729
Before that, it was probably like 10 to 15 years.

3869
05:21:16,729 --> 05:21:21,919
Dude, what the, I'm not gonna let you tell me.

3870
05:21:21,919 --> 05:21:23,119
Didn't you say 20 minutes?

3871
05:21:23,119 --> 05:21:25,459
I don't know how fucking long it was.

3872
05:21:25,459 --> 05:21:32,139
It was at least 20 minutes.

3873
05:21:32,139 --> 05:21:33,340
Where are the customers?

3874
05:21:33,459 --> 05:21:38,110
Wait, hold on, whose order do I have?

3875
05:21:38,110 --> 05:21:41,990
Whose order is this?

3876
05:21:41,990 --> 05:21:47,369
There ain't nobody here.

3877
05:21:47,369 --> 05:21:48,970
Who am I making this for, me?

3878
05:22:23,880 --> 05:22:29,189
I gotta hurry this up, they've been gone.

3879
05:22:29,189 --> 05:22:31,790
No one wants to eat your moldy ice cream.

3880
05:22:31,790 --> 05:22:35,259
I don't know, I don't know how many times I've puked, okay?

3881
05:22:35,259 --> 05:22:38,169
Hey, probably a few in the last 10 years.

3882
05:22:38,169 --> 05:22:42,200
Maybe like three.

3883
05:22:42,200 --> 05:22:44,279
Hey, how about this, how many times have you puked?

3884
05:22:44,279 --> 05:22:46,630
What was the last time you puked, huh?

3885
05:22:46,630 --> 05:22:48,950
How many times have you puked in the last year?

3886
05:22:48,950 --> 05:22:52,819
Two years, five years.

3887
05:22:52,860 --> 05:22:56,490
I'm gonna flip it on you now.

3888
05:22:56,490 --> 05:22:57,849
Sometimes you just kind of feel like shit,

3889
05:22:57,849 --> 05:23:08,419
and sometimes you puke, whatever.

3890
05:23:08,419 --> 05:23:10,939
Hey, maybe every few years or something.

3891
05:23:10,939 --> 05:23:29,990
Something like that happens that often.

3892
05:23:29,990 --> 05:23:34,069
Couple of months ago I did, I ate a full pizza.

3893
05:23:34,069 --> 05:23:35,509
That's what I'm saying, I had like pizza

3894
05:23:35,509 --> 05:23:37,430
and it was like settling wrong with me.

3895
05:23:37,430 --> 05:23:54,950
Settled wrong.

3896
05:23:54,950 --> 05:24:02,849
Oh shit, well that's 75 points.

3897
05:24:02,849 --> 05:24:04,490
I actually like this comment a lot.

3898
05:24:04,490 --> 05:24:08,169
Imagine throwing up, wait, I gotta read it.

3899
05:24:08,169 --> 05:24:09,970
It was like about like being adult or something,

3900
05:24:09,970 --> 05:24:11,909
hold on, it was funny.

3901
05:24:11,909 --> 05:24:16,000
Where is it?

3902
05:24:16,000 --> 05:24:19,470
Where is it, it was funny.

3903
05:24:19,470 --> 05:24:30,029
Come on, I can't find it.

3904
05:24:30,029 --> 05:24:32,430
I don't know what the message was.

3905
05:24:32,430 --> 05:24:34,189
It was like, oh, imagine you throwing up,

3906
05:24:34,189 --> 05:24:36,319
like being an adult.

3907
05:24:36,319 --> 05:24:38,520
Yeah, imagine throwing up, you're an adult.

3908
05:24:42,959 --> 05:24:45,000
All right, if that's a true statement,

3909
05:24:45,000 --> 05:24:46,840
this is coming from somebody that's probably never had

3910
05:24:46,840 --> 05:24:48,639
one of those 24 hour bugs,

3911
05:24:48,639 --> 05:24:51,430
where you are puking and shitting every 15 minutes.

3912
05:24:51,430 --> 05:24:54,590
And I'm sorry, but I'm actually really happy

3913
05:24:54,590 --> 05:24:58,040
that you've never had to experience that before.

3914
05:24:58,040 --> 05:24:59,080
I'm actually really glad

3915
05:24:59,080 --> 05:25:00,479
that you've never had to deal with that.

3916
05:25:00,479 --> 05:25:01,919
That's actually great.

3917
05:25:01,919 --> 05:25:04,580
I hope you never have to.

3918
05:25:04,580 --> 05:25:10,630
I have had to deal with that before and it is not fun.

3919
05:25:10,630 --> 05:25:17,000
You're an adult, I love that.

3920
05:25:17,000 --> 05:25:18,959
I don't eat poisonous food.

3921
05:25:23,209 --> 05:25:24,970
You don't know what you, what?

3922
05:25:24,970 --> 05:25:35,599
It's not, they're jealous, dude.

3923
05:25:35,599 --> 05:25:38,159
I don't know if you'd be jealous of somebody throwing up

3924
05:25:38,159 --> 05:25:41,180
and like shitting their pants.

3925
05:25:41,180 --> 05:25:51,630
I didn't shit my pants.

3926
05:25:51,630 --> 05:25:52,750
All right, I'll see you guys later.

3927
05:25:52,750 --> 05:26:00,740
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3928
05:26:00,740 --> 05:26:02,900
So you shit your pants in an Uber.

3929
05:26:02,939 --> 05:26:11,400
You guys, I swear to God.

3930
05:26:11,400 --> 05:26:12,759
Imagine walking into a restaurant

3931
05:26:12,759 --> 05:26:14,560
and the cashier is just straight up rambling

3932
05:26:14,560 --> 05:26:16,040
about all the times he puked.

3933
05:26:28,220 --> 05:26:32,029
I'm gonna shit your pants.

3934
05:26:32,029 --> 05:26:32,869
All right, I feel like we should,

3935
05:26:32,869 --> 05:26:34,229
all right, I feel like you should time that person

3936
05:26:34,229 --> 05:26:37,729
out for five minutes.

3937
05:26:37,729 --> 05:26:39,569
Right, that's like five minutes, right?

3938
05:26:39,569 --> 05:26:49,069
I guess you should be timed up for two minutes.

3939
05:26:49,069 --> 05:26:52,189
You're gonna puke in your Uber.

3940
05:26:52,189 --> 05:27:00,349
Oh my God.

3941
05:27:00,349 --> 05:27:05,240
Hey, how about, don't be an asshole to Uber drivers.

3942
05:27:05,240 --> 05:27:18,840
They gotta deal with enough bullshit as it is.

3943
05:27:18,880 --> 05:27:20,599
Am I the asshole?

3944
05:27:20,599 --> 05:27:27,810
Am I the asshole?

3945
05:27:27,810 --> 05:27:31,080
Please don't shit in my pants.

3946
05:27:31,080 --> 05:27:43,240
All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3947
05:27:43,240 --> 05:27:44,080
This is fun.

3948
05:27:44,080 --> 05:27:44,919
I like this.

3949
05:27:44,919 --> 05:27:47,240
This is a good time.

3950
05:27:47,240 --> 05:27:50,889
I'm gonna watch some ads tomorrow.

3951
05:27:50,889 --> 05:27:52,930
That's the plan.

3952
05:27:52,930 --> 05:27:55,930
Starting somewhere around 4 p.m. Pacific,

3953
05:27:55,930 --> 05:28:01,930
a couple hours earlier.

3954
05:28:01,930 --> 05:28:05,150
Tomorrow, probably not gonna be a long one tomorrow.

3955
05:28:05,150 --> 05:28:06,799
Maybe a few hours.

3956
05:28:06,799 --> 05:28:07,959
I feel like there's only a certain amount

3957
05:28:07,959 --> 05:28:12,919
of those videos that we can handle.

3958
05:28:12,919 --> 05:28:16,200
But Sunday we will do a big meaty one

3959
05:28:16,200 --> 05:28:23,799
because of House Flipper.

3960
05:28:24,000 --> 05:28:26,229
We'll see you tomorrow.

3961
05:28:26,229 --> 05:28:30,349
Take care of yourselves.

3962
05:28:30,349 --> 05:28:34,659
Club Penguin Sound Effects has been going for two hours

3963
05:28:34,659 --> 05:28:39,119
and I'm not even upset about it.

3964
05:28:39,119 --> 05:28:40,400
Is this saved?

3965
05:28:40,400 --> 05:28:46,090
I think so, right?

3966
05:28:46,090 --> 05:28:48,840
Yep.

3967
05:28:48,840 --> 05:28:51,470
Thanks for sticking around.

3968
05:28:51,470 --> 05:28:52,569
See you tomorrow.

3969
05:28:52,569 --> 05:28:54,490
If you're gonna show up tomorrow,

3970
05:28:54,490 --> 05:28:57,770
I would highly suggest you do if you have time.

3971
05:28:57,770 --> 05:29:00,090
I feel like tomorrow will be a really fun stream.

3972
05:29:00,090 --> 05:29:09,750
Those ad streams are really actually some of my favorites.

3973
05:29:09,750 --> 05:29:10,590
What time tomorrow?

3974
05:29:10,590 --> 05:29:18,029
4 p.m. Pacific is when I'm gonna start.

3975
05:29:18,029 --> 05:29:26,369
We'll get some decent compilations going.

3976
05:29:26,369 --> 05:29:32,360
See you soon.

3977
05:29:32,360 --> 05:29:35,169
Can you do a sober stream tomorrow?

3978
05:29:36,599 --> 05:29:51,409
Yes.

3979
05:29:51,409 --> 05:29:52,939
But yeah, take care.

3980
05:29:52,939 --> 05:29:55,040
Call your mother.

3981
05:29:55,040 --> 05:29:55,880
Have a great evening.

3982
05:29:55,880 --> 05:29:59,169
It's really late for a lot of you.

3983
05:29:59,169 --> 05:30:03,310
Late night, Andy.

3984
05:30:03,310 --> 05:30:08,229
See you soon.

3985
05:30:08,229 --> 05:31:03,959
Ta ta.
