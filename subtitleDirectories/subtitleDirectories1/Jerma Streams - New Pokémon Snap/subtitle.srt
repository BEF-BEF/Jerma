1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:13,289
Hello, when you call me early? I don't think I'm early. I think I'm right on time.

2
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:24,120
Hey, by the way, since doing the new schedule, once a week, Andy, I don't think I've been late

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,920
at all. I think I've started at exactly 12 to 12.01. Wait, no, that was the one, there was one time

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,689
where my computer was freaking out. Binding of Isaac was freaking out.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,140
But for the most part, like 80% of the time, it's been exactly at 12 PM.

6
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:55,829
How you doing? How was how was your week? Is it good? Well, I'm Andy. Today, we're gonna be playing

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,079
a new game. I know everyone did. Oh, you don't want to hear that. We're playing Pokemon Snap

8
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:10,120
Switch Edition. I do have a problem with the title. I don't know. I don't know what is with

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,409
Nintendo in this shit. They're the only people that do this. Nintendo is the only company besides

10
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:25,370
some furniture cleaning companies and like Lysol spray type companies that put new in front of

11
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:34,489
stuff. And has made a new product. New OxiClean. New Pokemon Snap. New Super Mario Brothers.

12
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,129
The only company that is one of four kind of companies that do this.

13
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:45,659
Like Pokemon Snap. You can't come up with a better name than New Pokemon Snap.

14
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:54,260
That was a pre-written joke. Oh, you better believe it was. It wasn't. I came up with that

15
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:01,219
right now. I'm just sitting here like I got a notepad with a bunch of potential intro jokes.

16
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,180
And I'm going to use them. Like I wrote them down. I'm a comedian. I know comedy.

17
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:16,550
I know it. Tell me I don't. This game suck. I don't know. It has a camera and you take pictures of

18
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,889
different Pokemons. Oh, I'm kind of excited. It's a camera. The game with a camera.

19
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:34,949
You have a plan B. No. Well, hold on. I had a plan A. This is the plan B. If you must know.

20
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:45,110
So I had plan A. Plan A was I downloaded, I don't know, maybe 30 to 40 dog shit iPad games.

21
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:53,219
And was going to do a dog shit iPad game stream. And what happened was started to kind of vet them

22
00:02:53,219 --> 00:03:00,180
a little bit. And none of them were fun or funny. So I have to kind of go back to the drawing board

23
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,560
on that one. Like they would just like I start I like opened them and realized they would just

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,889
kind of like take over my iPad and shit. It like wasn't even worth doing. So like six made it out

25
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,370
of like the 40 that I found. So it's gonna have to happen is over the next probably week or two.

26
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,469
I'm going to compile more and do that at some point. That was the plan A. This is the plan B.

27
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:35,800
The virus stream. So you downloaded viruses willingly. Yes. They're not viruses. They're just

28
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:45,449
bad. All right. You know what like probably the worst insult to like a game designer is?

29
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:54,060
Like a game developer. Is if you call their game a virus game. Because that just means that holy

30
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,699
shit this was so bad. That like I think it may have infected my computer. That's bottom. Absolute

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:09,349
bottom of the barrel to be to have you to say that about somebody's game. I just like I just

32
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:15,740
made that game for fun. I just was like playing around in like unity. This is a virus game. Oh,

33
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:28,279
would you at least have said cereal box? All right. You guys ready? I'm ready to play this.

34
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:34,060
By the way, this is the first Pokemon game I've played on the channel. You count the the TV one

35
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:43,750
like watch TV with Pikachu. I guess that's that count. Does this game count? Is this non-canon?

36
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:56,569
I don't know. What did you say? Oh my god. I'm so tired of this schedule. I'd rather you stream

37
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:02,810
one minute a day per week. I would have. All right. I would have been gone five minutes ago.

38
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,889
That would be the shittiest content. Can you imagine if I just showed up for a minute and then left?

39
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,860
That's just enough time to remind a bunch of people that their sub is running out.

40
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:27,639
Yeah, I'm not going to do that. All right. Let's go. Leave now. All right. English. Please select

41
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:37,990
your appearance. You can't change your appearance. This kind of looks like me. Which one? I have blue

42
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:50,980
eyes. This is me. Jeremy. Sure. I'm just going to be. I guess I'm just going to be Jeremy.

43
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:02,490
That's me. I'm not being a character today. It's just me. What do you mean today? I'm not being a

44
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:11,100
character today. Like do I normally? Am I normally a fucking character? What am I talking about?

45
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:18,709
No, I'm going to be me today. Why does the snap look so blown up and like awful looking?

46
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:34,569
Is that a Pokemon? Get Pikachu out of here. They only put him in here for fucking nostalgia.

47
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:41,779
I want the new Pokemon. I don't care about Pikachu. He's in. He's only in here for nostalgia.

48
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:51,800
Greetings. True. Hi there. I'm glad you made it. Who's the professor that everyone was pissed

49
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,600
off that I didn't know who it was? It's not Professor Mirror, right? It was Professor Oak.

50
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,490
It's the one that I didn't know and everyone freaked out. Welcome to the Laboratory of

51
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:10,490
Ecology and Natural Sciences or LENS for short. My name is Mirror. Yeah, I didn't know who Professor

52
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,209
Oak was. I'm researching Pokemon and their natural environment here on Florio Island.

53
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,519
Yeah, and that's not all. The professor is going to study every single island here in the Lental

54
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:29,930
region. No one's ever done an ecological survey like this before. It's going to be amazing.

55
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:38,680
No one? Aren't you forgetting a certain explorer? Are Pokemons considered wild animals?

56
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,629
Is that- what are- are they- are they- yes, they are, yeah. I don't know if they were like-

57
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,379
they're supposed to be like cartoons or something. I'm gonna keep going.

58
00:07:52,629 --> 00:08:01,430
It's a good point. You've read the stories of Captain Vince. I don't know anything about- I

59
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,790
don't know anything about Pokemon. This is the worst channel you could watch right now that's

60
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,170
playing this. I'm just going to criticize and annoy you if you're a fan of this universe.

61
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,889
This is the game you play if you're a fan of the universe. This is like the side

62
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:18,810
I'm a fan of the universe game. I'm not a fan of the universe and here I am.

63
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:30,629
I just like cameras in video games. Well, thanks. This is Rita. Her parents are good friends of mine.

64
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,019
She's here on vacation while her school's on break. I'm not just here to goof off, Professor.

65
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,179
I'm your research assistant. Ah yes, that's right, and I appreciate the help.

66
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,120
Now before we go over what you'll be doing in this program, why don't we step into the lab

67
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:54,820
and get settled? Right, you are, Professor. I'll lead the way. Camera Andy. Yeah, it's fun.

68
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,309
I see you got yourself a fucking gamer chair over there. All right, let me- allow me to explain.

69
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:09,740
Yeah, these are wild animals in this person's house. That's what I was talking about. Like,

70
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,019
these wild animals just run around in this house? The lentil region is absolutely teeming with

71
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:21,379
Pokemon. Photographing those Pokemon helps us learn more about them and their ecosystem.

72
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:29,350
They can be tamed. Yeah, all right, I understand. You've watched the one YouTube video.

73
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:36,230
Of the guy that has like the alligator as a pet. And it has like 1.6 million views. And we've all

74
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,509
seen it. And we're like, holy shit, that's fucking crazy. But you don't actually have an alligator

75
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:50,700
in your house. You're not going to. It's like three people on earth. A fatal frame. And now you might

76
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,850
even get to see glowing Pokemon. They're really- really. Now without further ado, here's your

77
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,659
research camera. Oh, there- that's pretty- that's pretty shitty for a camera that I'm gonna get.

78
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:05,179
It looks like a Walmart disposable camera. You- you couldn't have ponied up a little bit more

79
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:11,370
research money and get me a fucking DSLR? I've got the same one. We can use them to communicate

80
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,110
with each other and the rest of the team too. That's right. It's more than just a camera. It

81
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,419
lets you keep in touch and analyze data on the fly. So it's an iPhone. Yep. Yep. It'll also serve

82
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:32,779
as a sort of an ID badge for you here. So take good care of it. Wait, it's an ID? Now remember,

83
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,789
son, there's only 25 photos on there. And what you're going to do is you're going to take that

84
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:42,549
to a wedding. You're going to take nine pictures. There's going to be 21 more photos on it. It's

85
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:47,289
going to sit in your closet for 16 years. You're going to take it out. You're going to take 10 more

86
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:52,070
pictures on it. You're going to put it back in your closet. Two more years go by. You're going

87
00:10:52,070 --> 00:11:01,779
to throw it in the trash and never get the photos developed. Awesome, right? The professor invented

88
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:08,620
it. Can I explain how to use it, professor? You're projecting again. I mean, I've done that like

89
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:17,429
probably four or five times. Who's ever developed photos from one of those cameras? Can I explain

90
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:22,490
how to use it, professor? Everything, Rita. Assist away. I'll go take care of some other

91
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,899
preparations. All right, come on. Let's go outside. I can't wait to take my first photo

92
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,100
as a photo Pokemon journalist. Tutorials are based on the default button layouts. Yeah. All right.

93
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:45,190
Perfect timing. Let me shoot it. All right. Press A to take a photo. I can't move the camera.

94
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:58,919
It was a bad picture. All right. That's A. Okay. And it's shaped like a Pokeball.

95
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:11,240
Okay. Oh, I see. All right. So we've got to get the house in the frame too.

96
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,049
You can point the camera all the way around.

97
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:19,860
Imagine needing to tell somebody how to use a camera. You can use a camera too.

98
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:28,279
Am I a caveman? Why do they have to teach me this? Oh, look. Here comes a Pikachu.

99
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:39,850
Oh, what's the zoom button? You're a small child. No, I'm not. How old is this kid? Like fucking 12?

100
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:50,409
That's old enough to know how to use a camera. First move so it's lined up with Pikachu. Okay.

101
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,610
Yeah, but who does a center shot? Amateur? It needs to be like over here. And I know

102
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,289
someone's going to go, rule of thirds is bullshit. Don't use it. I use it. I think it looks good.

103
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:22,379
I did. Okay. So there's like a face recognition. I always turn that off. I hate that. Got it. You're

104
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:32,220
using it wrong. I don't even have control of the camera right now. It's called zooming in.

105
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:47,019
Oh, ZL. Okay. Nice and big. Oh my God. Okay. Got it. See how much bigger it looked?

106
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,460
Do you want your subject's whole body in the middle of the frame? No, you don't.

107
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,100
Nice and big. Okay. Controls are setting me. Pause menu. All right.

108
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:18,820
Oh, you taught him how to use a camera. Great. Now let's teach him how to pour cereal into a bowl.

109
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:29,269
How to flush the toilet. And the very hard task of making your bed. How was that? I hope you're

110
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:40,309
getting the hang of your research camera. Do you mind choosing one shot of each Pokemon you've

111
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:45,340
photographed? I'll rate them using my special scoring system. Pick whichever shots you think

112
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:55,539
are the best. I only took like two pictures. Like the Pikachu folder. I have folders? Okay.

113
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:59,620
You can choose a photo by moving the pointer. Press A when you've decided which one to show me.

114
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,299
That one. All right. How about the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

115
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:21,289
the. Okay. I only took one picture. Press or select show professor. Show him.

116
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:34,309
Okay. What does he think? Starting with photo number one. It's beautiful. Oh, it's Pikachu.

117
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:39,799
This is the first time you've gotten it as your subject. Pose, size, direction placement, other

118
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:47,620
Pokemon background from one to four stars. I came up with a system to help us understand and

119
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:55,639
categorize how pokemon behave photos of pokemon in an ordinary state get fewer stars more unusual

120
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,639
behavior means more stars all right he's gotta get him doing weird cool stuff be clear the number

121
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:08,360
of a star a photo receives doesn't affect its score every category is important by the way the

122
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,320
camera keeps logs of what was happening when you took each photo that data helps me categorize your

123
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:38,809
what does that mean hold on let me get auto auto you want to come up let's hear that i have

124
00:16:39,860 --> 00:17:05,480
hold on i was clearing out my closet hey show auto oh you didn't think what you put excuse

125
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,819
me you didn't think that you were going to be able to see something important you were going to see

126
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:34,970
a mustache shit lord it's not really there we go oh my pants my pants are unzipped are they

127
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:43,450
my pants are unzipped oh my god i think my pants are unzipped no they're not okay holy shit that

128
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:51,660
was just the most terrifying thing i've ever done in my life i think like that was like in my mind

129
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,069
my career ended i'll be honest with you what going through my brain was my career is over

130
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:04,230
it's it's over i like my like there's my like my it's open that's my biggest fucking fear

131
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:26,220
but in what what what's the matter he's got a problem i pull out a lightsaber like oh this is

132
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,470
like it's like dick is out that's like i'm gone forever but i mean that would be like really

133
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,740
really funny way to go out that would be like fucking crazy like what i would live forever

134
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,329
that would be like that would be an image or a video that would be shared forever like i would

135
00:18:46,329 --> 00:19:02,099
be i would live forever anyways by the way the camera keeps logs of what was happening what was

136
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:15,319
i doing okay let's move on to the scoring i'll evaluate the subject's pose snapping your photo

137
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:21,779
at just the right moment is key to getting a high pose score i didn't show auto i did not i was i

138
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:30,119
hold on i'll show him like in a few weeks okay so it's pose the larger your subject is in the photo

139
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:37,750
the better and there's the direction the pokemon is facing so you want to be big facing you doing

140
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:47,980
a cool pose center of the frame bonus of this other pokemon in the photo all right i just take

141
00:19:47,980 --> 00:20:01,130
good photos whatever so why is it right in the center that's not usually good pictures it's

142
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:08,920
hard to believe you're a beginner all right well i don't want to save this that photo i don't want

143
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:19,779
it in my album but that one's not as good okay good pose bad direction though how is direction

144
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:37,109
better than size which one is a pokemon they're all pokemon they're not supposed to be artistic

145
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:43,940
photos well i'm gonna take some liberty and do that i'm gonna have some artistic photos

146
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:56,119
but i'm supposed to just zoom in and take a picture of their face i'm an artist i should be

147
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:06,299
treated as such this is for scientific research look at this pod it'll carry you on your photography

148
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:15,450
expeditions it's called the neo one it's the best it can teleport to far off places in no time

149
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,019
flat you all know i like that word and every time i get a chance to say it i love saying it i finally

150
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:27,269
put the finishing touches on it not long ago with a little help from someone i know see it makes use

151
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:33,859
of energy hotspots scattered throughout the lentil region come on professor the details can wait

152
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:42,140
all right let's let's go climb on in and touch your camera to the console what like the switch

153
00:21:42,140 --> 00:22:04,299
calls oh he has to do it i'm like fucking 12 they just put me in an experimental like traveling pod

154
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:09,299
i don't have a license what they were just concerned about me not knowing how to use a

155
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:20,869
camera they're gonna make me go drive a car oh here we go here we go all right oh beautiful

159
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:23,829

160
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:38,339
artistic photo it's above the the weeds what's that thing this is this is like too easy isn't it

161
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,750
this is easy this is a ride this is just a ride at disney world what this is not hard

162
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:56,519
it is all right here to take a picture of and it's moving for me this is a kid's game what

163
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,160
i just ride around and take pictures i thought this is going to be like hard to do this or

164
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:15,769
something i don't know this is so many pictures you're a child how many how many pokemons are

165
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:32,200
in the game ready got it perfect that's a perfect photo okay uh here we go you guys ready if you

166
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,200
were i got it if you were to offer me a million dollars right now for me to name these as they

167
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,460
come on screen i wouldn't be able to do it i wouldn't be able to get one let's see if i can

168
00:24:44,460 --> 00:25:03,849
get one uh it just showed me and i don't i don't remember i'm flying above what's that is it

169
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:28,740
what is a hoot hoot come here that was a bee doof right into the camera turn right is he gonna stay

170
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:37,579
i gotta get him flying by he's gonna fly right here and i'm gonna get it oh my god that was

171
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:54,299
this guy just wants me to take a picture of him whoa get that these are pokemons what the

172
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:00,200
fuck are these things all right they ran out of ideas they ran out of ideas this is like it's like

173
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:17,980
a friendship bracelet that's not even a pokemon what is that what's that basically it's the end

174
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:33,529
of the course okay so in conclusion it's this so basically it's this in theory it's this

175
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:40,710
anime does that a lot doesn't it a character will be talking and then they'll go

176
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:49,690
in conclusion i think that this this this this in theory this this this this therefore

177
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:59,670
this this this this okay i took 39 photos now just like before it's time to show me some photos you

178
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:14,220

00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:27,660
okay dodrio i only took two pictures of this guy that i mean it's that one this one's cooler

180
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:40,579

186
00:28:46,970 --> 00:29:01,079

187
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:08,859
hoot hoot what about the what about the this the bird that flew by

188
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:23,319
there's no subject all right that's it i'm doing it wait what about this one that's pretty good

189
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:42,230
it's that one all right here we go what do you think about my tutorial moves okay the villain

190
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:54,339
wow those are big numbers nice and big would you like to keep this new photo or the one in

191
00:29:54,339 --> 00:30:06,279
the photo decks i'll keep the new one it's way better that's one star all right dodrio position

192
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:17,099
size direction placement it's not bad it's a gold star yeah it's one to four stars

193
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:30,259
that one's not good but it's still it conveys a lot of emotion i think that conveys a lot less

194
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:42,759
than a thousand right now too that's fine it conveys sadness keychu that one's bad too but

195
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:54,250
he wasn't he was i couldn't get a good photo of him he was like far away it was the first

196
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:08,490
tutorial zone great timing oh other pokemon the sus guy is bad at photography do not call me the

197
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,730
sus guy okay that's not what i go by that's not what i go by my name is germa this is the

201
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:52,009
metal that is that was good too it's cute size direction placement other pokemon that's a gold

202
00:31:52,009 --> 00:32:08,200
star well it's not my fault they won't get boring photos that's a i mean if that if this game is

203
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,920
just take a photo of something close what's in the middle of the frame that's the best you're

204
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:27,049
gonna get size direction placement yeah that's a five thousand dollar play here comes the sus fans

205
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:36,099
same with this one i gotta get other other animals i'm gonna call them animals i'm not

206
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:39,940
calling them pokemons i want i'm gonna say animals it's way easier for me to say

207
00:32:46,539 --> 00:33:05,299
oh i refuse to say pokemons i'm gonna say animals is that is that its butt do i get um

208
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:12,259
they're getting upgrades research oh here we go i need 40 000 points to get a research level too

209
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:25,660
holy shit i'm almost there bus guy doesn't like pokemon hey went thanks for the 20 community subs

210
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,660
20 subs from went thank you thank you though that's a lot once that level goes up you may

211
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,740
see pokemon behave in ways you haven't seen before the key to raising your research level is to

212
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,980
observe all types of animal behavior that means getting photographs of them in every category

213
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:52,950
from one to four so in short fill up that photo that animal photo library keep that in mind and

214
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,589
you'll be on the right track but get out there and snap lots of photos and cherish the encounters

215
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:02,950
with the animals you have along the way way easier i'd never have guessed it was your first trip out

216
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:10,579
there keep up the good work is this do an ipad present there's an ipad present i didn't but i

217
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,059
had to touch the screen for that to be an ipad present you researched lorio nature park for the

218
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:20,780
first time you got a score of a thousand points or more in the direction category during a photo

219
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:28,539
evaluation you got a score of a thousand in the placement category yep save the photos you took

220
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:36,550
to your album um yes after your research trips you can choose photos to save to your album which

221
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:42,500
is in your space in the lab you can also choose re-snap to make some changes to the photos before

222
00:34:42,500 --> 00:35:02,019
you save them okay i want where i want this one look at that re-snap wow this is awesome okay

223
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:23,190

238
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:44,440
you go let me tell you one more thing you can do with your research camera you can run a scan

239
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,829
that'll give you a thesis about your surroundings cool tells you about nearby animals and points

240
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:57,210
out anything unusual what counts as unusual you've never given me a solid answer it's why is it gonna

241

243
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:19,900
go check this out well i guess that's all the detail we're gonna get those are lab goggles

244
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:31,699
are they they look kind of huge why does he need what what do you okay what does he need them for

245

she doesn't have them i don't have them why does he have those what are they for

246
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,590

better all right let's go oh i have to do from every folder and none of these none of these are

292
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:21,820
worth pulling in i mean that one's kind of cool no these are like they suck not better but more

293
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:37,579
special okay pose is worse size is worse everything is worse but placement well i'm not keeping this

294
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:49,900
one the old one that's the same picture i took before what's the difference i want to know what

295
00:49:49,900 --> 00:50:05,400
the difference is the only difference is two of their eyes are closed it's a worse photo okay the

296
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:23,239
pose is probably better i could work on size all right now this is a three star three star pose

297
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:29,989
size direction placement that's not that's three gold stars that's gonna be worth a lot

298
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:40,440
oh is this one okay i did you guys hear that did you did you hear that did that pick up on the mic

that was the lightsaber i didn't touch it it just like turned on i didn't do anything this one's

301
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:09,000
bad too but it's probably fine all right i'll be at research research level um two right we got

302
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:19,530
another 10 you know how we say it here stay with me another 10 community subs from wenty lair

303
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:28,460
all right let's step forward for our research i bet i bet animals in the area are getting

304
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:34,579
comfortable with you by the way thanks to the progress you've made in your research i've got

305
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:39,500
something to report i feel even once your photos are squared away i think you'll be pleased to hear

306
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:47,539
this all right should i save any of these no none of these did it for me except for maybe this one

307
00:51:48,260 --> 00:52:14,619
i'm relating to like the bird photos these are awful how are these filters these are terrible

308
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:26,969
i was i was thinking of like snapchat instagram filters like iphone filters

309
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:38,199
you get better ones later oh all right then we'll fuck this i'm out none of these weren't any good

310
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:53,000
wait that one's kind of cool saving that one how does this boomer know what snapchat is

311
00:52:53,719 --> 00:53:02,699
like you're not you're telling me that you dive you've never downloaded snapchat and put like

312
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,820
trump's face on your face just like recorded yourself going let me tell you listen no believe

313
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:18,250
every single one of us did that like there's not one person i don't think in the world that

314
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:32,500
didn't do that for like 10 minutes only boomers do that that was when face swapping was first

315
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:39,320
introduced i've never done that and i don't intend to i i'm just telling you like that's

316
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:57,000
what people did yeah many times i put on from game of thrones putting on like different characters

317
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:12,949
faces and just doing their monologues snl humor that's me putting like a face on my face i'm not

318
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:18,230
sharing this with the public by the way i was just doing it in the comfort of my privacy of my own

319
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:32,219
living room you're the one who discovered how that glow happens it's even weirder that is not

320
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:38,409
weirder how many of you sing in the shower i want to know how many people's here sing in the shower

321
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:48,789
some of you i know at least some of you do actually me me me me me okay is that an

322
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:54,150
is that insane are you insane for doing that i don't sing in the shower i do like celebrity

323
00:54:54,150 --> 00:55:03,179
impressions in the shower what's the difference you are imitating a song that you heard i'm

324
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:18,809
imitating a person i've heard how's that different it's the same thing there's a big difference no

325
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:27,050
it's not you singing firework in your shower is not is the exact same thing as me just putting

326
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,730
my hands up looking left and right with the water hitting me in the face going imitate excuse me

327
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:37,130
believe me it's the same thing it's the exact same thing it's just you happen to have a tone

328
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:52,949
while you're doing it why do you sing in the shower what's it for is armin a celebrity

329
00:55:53,510 --> 00:56:05,590
i mean kinda yeah i mean is he probably i mean yeah maybe the actor is like an actor i'm imitating

330
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:26,949
the i'm imitating an actor okay that's really funny he is he's doing voices while touching

331
00:56:26,949 --> 00:56:36,170
himself in the shower you can't just add shit onto this missing the plot there's animals you

332
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:48,940
take photos of who cares for now enjoy your nighttime outing okay sometimes you wonder

333
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:55,349
if i'm a lab experiment what you should be wondering is how did i get out

334
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:10,820
at night you might be able to see the illumina phenomenon at the nature park observe your

335
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:18,980
surroundings carefully you got there's currently a poll 51 percent of you sing in the shower

336
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:30,570
and i'm weird for doing like celebrity impressions in the shower i'm the weird guy but when you are

337
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:38,730
singing you are imitating the voice the cadence and the tone of the singer who sings the song

338
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:49,619
you're crazy you're the weird sus guy

339
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:03,619

372
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:46,380

373
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:54,409
you really it's only gonna burn your skin for you to know it's working that's a good photo

374
01:05:55,050 --> 01:06:06,650
yeah a lot of uh antiperspirants use aluminum dioxide yeah that doesn't sound good four stars

375
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:17,059
but it's bronze oh well that's the first four star um i'm just painting can't sweat if your

376
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:32,789
skin has melted off um is that true discovery no deodorant's fine deodorant just makes it so

377
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:48,760
you don't smell it just like makes you smell nice an antiperspirant and here's the thing

378
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,159
about antiperspirant i'm about to let you guys in on a very very very strong held not a secret

379
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:57,320
this is literally you can just google this in five seconds figure this out um if you wear

380
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:05,860
antiperspirant it makes you sweat more in my case i used to put this on i would put on just like a

381
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:11,619
standard just deodorant antiperspirant and i would just i would be soaking through my shirt and my

382
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:23,880
underarms since i have stopped wearing this is this is absolutely true this is completely true

383
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:32,099
since i have stopped using an antiperspirant over time i don't have you guys remember how i

384
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:39,030
lift up my shirt and i'd be like oh sweat check yeah i don't have like big wet marks on my arms

388
01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:35,050
there was nothing there what do you remember how huge it was before you remember how gigantic it

389
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:43,060

390
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:47,539
hot here even with like air conditioning i'm sitting down getting really heated streaming

391
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:53,460
in like a hot streamer room this is that's that's you should you should have seen how it was like

392
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:59,699
a few years ago do you remember how fucking revolting it was it was revolting three or four

393
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:04,260
years ago i would lift it up it would be like somebody it was a joke like somebody poured water

394
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:28,779
on me i i want to know how good this one is that's okay good that's diamond it looks sad i don't like

395
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:48,600
this picture maybe you just have a better diet no i don't think so it's because i was wearing

396
01:09:49,159 --> 01:10:09,029
i don't wear it anymore i just wear like a gentle deodorant it was the mayo sweats all right level

397
01:10:09,029 --> 01:10:27,909
one going on to level two almost perky sweats your sweat backing up is causing your back pain

398
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:40,199
what if that would be that would be quite a discovery okay uh crystal bloom by the way

399
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,520
thanks to the progress you've made in your research i've got something to report

400
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,760
i'll fill you in once your photos are squared away i think you'll be pleased to hear this

401
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:58,649
i don't want to save any of this sponsored viewer this game is awesome pogchamp you can save your

402
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:15,189
photos to the nintendo switch album no what is this something in credit what's what happened

403
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:26,810
that looks bad here's the thing what's the point of that cutscene it's like was just animated and

404
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:33,479
like cg and stuff when you get near that field of flowers i picked up an incredibly strong energy

405
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:39,909
reading also its source seemed to be moving too if only slightly which suggests that we've

406
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:50,149
got here is an illumina pokemon we can't be sure yet but i suspect so i wonder why it showed up

407
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:56,869
did you do anything special i also doubt that it appeared when it did by chance but i think you

408
01:11:56,869 --> 01:12:02,329
should be the one to investigate the area where that reading is coming from oh i want to go see

409
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:08,899
you can watch the monitor with me it's gonna be real dangerous it's gonna be full of radiation

410
01:12:08,899 --> 01:12:26,199
why do you think we're sending the fucking new guy anyways kid have fun sending a kid

431
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:25,479
that you've had a new stage in your research keep an eye out for changes so i have to go back there

432
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:38,520
and take a picture when the animal does something different and does a new pose you need to go take

440
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:46,279
ahem moving on there's no doubt about it that meganium was an illumina pokemon they all

441

450
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:49,689
i really thought this is a career ending stream i thought that like my fly was down and that like

451
01:22:49,689 --> 01:22:58,170
i was in deep deep shit there's probably a frame grab you could take of me looking down and having

452
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:05,539
like that half second of like panic on camera you could it's i stream at 60 fps you could probably

453
01:23:05,539 --> 01:23:16,739
find one frame where it's just like oh my god he thinks he's naked i've been preparing to launch

454
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:24,340
an ecological survey spanning the entire lentil region no sooner had you arrived than we suddenly

455
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:32,260
found in right dog i think there's a connection professor i can't be sure yet but fascinating

456
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:40,119
things are bound to happen if you come with us really oh you know maybe for a scientist

457
01:23:40,119 --> 01:23:50,460
you sure can be vague sometimes professional i think it's a good idea i'll be way more fun

458
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:57,420
it'll be way more fun with you along right ready to officially join our research team

459
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:09,979

463
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:53,699
next time you're headed out to do some research sounded like deku from my hero academia you did

464
01:24:55,989 --> 01:25:00,390
oh it's really wild well i wonder who's gonna win this tournament is that that's not no it's not

465
01:25:00,949 --> 01:25:12,220
you officially joined the lentil region officially joined the lentil region research team

466
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:25,590
all right let's go i'm talking about anime you guys are talking about it i just said

467
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:30,380
literally one word now that you're a full-fledged team member i have something for you that'll come

468
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:44,039
in handy food on your trips enough feeding me these guys get one apple oh by the way

469
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:50,899
i forgot i haven't been feeding either of you here's an apple it's been four days is just me

470
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:56,010
or have you been getting me to do a lot more of the work lately professor well time to explain

471
01:25:56,010 --> 01:26:01,189
like the great assistant i am he's gone what happened to him what happened to him is he all

472
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:10,810
right this is a this is a fluff fruit they grow here it's an apple why can't you just say apple

473
01:26:11,369 --> 01:26:17,239
this is my problem with this whole universe why can't you just say apple this is a fluff fruit

474
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:22,279
they grow here in the lentil region they're sweet and tasty it's like they're like afraid to get

475
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:28,579
copyright infringement on apple and like pears and grapes and stuff i don't understand they're

476
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:33,539
sweet and tasty and they make a great snack for a pokemon they may look just like regular apples

477
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:41,369
but they're way lighter and softer oh so oh so they're a macintosh my favorite you probably

478
01:26:41,369 --> 01:26:54,520
make a pokemon's day if you toss it one of these let's get you some practice macintosh is the best

479
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,619

486
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:18,140
they're kind of heavy you should try testing out fluff root and taking some more photos in the

487
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:24,569
meantime professor says there are all kinds of ways to use it finished explaining ic thanks

you honestly telling me this is not at least two stars that's an incredible photo how is this photo

539
01:39:46,659 --> 01:40:12,010
better than this one star is pose rarity i think this is the one right here yeah what the hell is

540
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:23,579
this i mean that's a this one's perfect right here let's get a good like just front right in the front

541
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:40,310
ours is what pose they're in there's nothing to do with quality i can't even see the pokemon here

542
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:46,789
i like how he reads comments but doesn't process what they say at all and then proceeds to not

543
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:53,000
understand welcome to every single day of my life in high school like does reading comprehension i

544
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:00,520
would just read and i could read very well but the text every paragraph i would go down the

545
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:06,939
paragraph before it was invisible ink and would just disappear i would only be able to comprehend

546
01:41:06,939 --> 01:41:12,779
like the current like one paragraph i was in and it just it was disappearing the book was

547
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:29,930
disappearing behind it i can do better than that that's a really good photo direction placement

548
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:36,979
that's yeah diamond there we go there we go all right i got i gotta get diamond one star diamond

01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:34,420
with all that data first you can check your photo dex that's the encyclopedic record you're building

587
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:41,029
with the photos you're taking isn't it cool getting to put together your very own photo dex

Wake up?

619
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:43,260
Yawn?

620
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,829
There it is.

621
01:55:44,829 --> 01:55:51,420
I got it.

622
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:55,180
You want to do it one more time?

623
01:55:55,180 --> 01:55:58,350
Oh, fine, I got it.

624
01:55:58,350 --> 01:56:10,140
What else, what else did I have to do?

625
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:13,770
You like apples?

626
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:15,979
That's going to be kind of cool.

627
01:56:18,819 --> 01:56:42,100
Whoa, this is the cutest thing ever.

628
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:44,189
Is it mad?

629
01:56:44,189 --> 01:56:50,920
Hey, I got to, we got to get an apple here.

630
01:56:50,920 --> 01:57:11,239
Erin, it was rude.

631
01:57:11,239 --> 01:57:16,289
What?

632
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:20,479
Ooh, this is cute.

633
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:21,619
This is very cute.

634
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:28,529
I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to wake him up.

635
01:57:28,529 --> 01:57:31,069
It's cool, this is very cute.

636
01:57:31,069 --> 01:57:38,279
I mean like super cute.

637
01:57:38,279 --> 01:57:45,569
Got it.

638
01:57:45,569 --> 01:57:47,550
Zooming Andy.

639
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:57,380
Yes, I want my subjects to be in frame.

640
01:57:57,380 --> 01:58:03,899
What we got?

641
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,310
One star.

642
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:12,949
And that's a better picture, you can see everything.

643
01:58:12,949 --> 01:58:16,619
All right, which one of these is the best?

644
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:20,130
Probably one of these.

645
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,899
I like that one.

646
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:25,640
Or this one, he's on the ground just creeping.

647
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:27,439
I like that one too, he's thinking.

648
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:28,920
We need to have one star.

649
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:40,020
We'll do this one, that one.

650
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:44,550
First one I have is much better.

651
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:49,500
All right, where's the yawning one?

652
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:52,460
That's yawning, that's yawning, right?

653
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:56,539
I love that one.

654
01:58:56,539 --> 01:58:57,699
This is him yawning.

655
01:58:57,699 --> 01:59:07,130
I need this one.

656
01:59:07,130 --> 01:59:09,130
Let's get it in the, get it in the book.

657
01:59:15,779 --> 01:59:20,000
I don't know, should I do?

658
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:29,899
Probably, probably one?

659
01:59:29,899 --> 01:59:32,899
Hey, that's, is this one better than the other one?

660
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:35,220
Probably not.

661
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:50,050
I need a two star, that one's fine.

662
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,229
This is a really good picture, come on.

663
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:54,270
His eyes, placement.

664
01:59:54,270 --> 01:59:59,029
Yeah, there it is.

665
01:59:59,029 --> 01:59:59,869
He's pogging.

666
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:08,170
I feel like this is probably a better photo.

667
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:09,380
No?

668
02:00:09,380 --> 02:00:11,239
No, I guess not.

669
02:00:11,239 --> 02:00:12,800
I think that's much better.

670
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:22,289
It's his eyes and face.

671
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:27,460
Oh, that's it.

672
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:33,380
Is there a Caterpie in this video?

673
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:37,869
Apparently there is.

674
02:00:37,869 --> 02:00:44,810
All right, this is the big ticket item here.

675
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:51,800
That's a golden, four star diamond.

676
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:57,619
Ain't gonna find a photo like that ever again.

677
02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:01,750
Place it in there.

678
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:07,109
I like this hoot hoot photo.

679
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:08,710
Bold, mm-hmm.

680
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:17,520
Just gotta get it in the book.

681
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,520
Digimon digital monsters.

682
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:24,699
Digimon digital monsters, digital monsters.

683
02:01:24,699 --> 02:01:30,460
Research level two.

684
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:31,859
I thought they were animals.

685
02:01:32,539 --> 02:01:40,340
They are.

686
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,180
Okay, what are the,

687
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:47,060
I have to go back to the boss monster thing.

688
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:49,100
The love of entertainment stopped zooming in.

689
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:51,460
No, I'm gonna, look, I'm gonna take my photos away.

690
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:52,300
I'm gonna take them.

691
02:01:52,300 --> 02:02:01,800
And they're good.

692
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:03,600
Wait, is that, that looks like a dog?

693
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:08,960
That was a regular dog.

694
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:17,170
I told you it was a dog.

695
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:19,819
This is Todd.

696
02:02:19,819 --> 02:02:22,340
He's a professional Pokemon photographer.

697
02:02:22,340 --> 02:02:25,989
His work takes him all over the world.

698
02:02:25,989 --> 02:02:27,430
Are you the one they caught?

699
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:29,590
Hey, bright dog on camera, way to go.

700
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:32,430
That's a big deal.

701
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:34,630
Todd, did you bring what I asked you to?

702
02:02:34,630 --> 02:02:36,170
Sure did.

703
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:37,170
You're a lifesaver.

704
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:40,939
Now we'll finally be able to set out.

705
02:02:40,939 --> 02:02:43,300
Is this guy a friend of yours, Professor?

706
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:46,710
An old travel companion, to be precise.

707
02:02:46,710 --> 02:02:50,810
He's been helping me plan our big survey of Lentil too.

708
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:53,609
No kidding.

709
02:02:53,609 --> 02:02:55,449
Oh, is that the new pod you put together?

710
02:02:55,449 --> 02:02:58,619
Reminds me of the good old days.

711
02:02:58,619 --> 02:03:04,050
But hey, let me see those Illumina Pokemon photos.

712
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:16,789
A kid, get your own mentor.

713
02:03:16,789 --> 02:03:27,220
What the fuck is this?

714
02:03:27,220 --> 02:03:29,380
So you're the new teammate, huh?

715
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:32,420
I'm Phil, Todd's number one student.

716
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:35,180
Easy there, Phil.

717
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:38,420
I'm tempted to take part in this big ecological survey

718
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:42,069
myself, but I have another idea.

719
02:03:42,069 --> 02:03:45,859
How about I send Phil with you instead?

720
02:03:45,859 --> 02:03:49,340
I'm fine with that if you are, Todd.

721
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,380
Yes, awesome.

722
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:53,779
You can be my stand-in for now.

723
02:03:53,779 --> 02:03:57,949
But don't forget, I'll need that badge back eventually.

724
02:03:57,989 --> 02:04:00,229
Well, fine, but if I take a super cool photo,

725
02:04:00,229 --> 02:04:03,300
I get to keep the badge.

726
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,060
Please stop this shit, Todd voice.

727
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:07,310
Why, does it make you, you don't like it?

728
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:12,649
Making you feel a certain way?

729
02:04:12,649 --> 02:04:14,329
That's what he sounds like.

730
02:04:14,329 --> 02:04:19,899
That's what he sounds like.

731
02:04:19,899 --> 02:04:20,979
What is that?

732
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:26,100
I don't know, I thought that was chin armor.

733
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:40,850
I thought he was wearing a fucking necklace.

734
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:42,619
Ooh, cool.

735
02:04:42,619 --> 02:04:43,699
That's not, I'm just pretending.

736
02:04:43,699 --> 02:04:45,500
Okay, I thought it was a new area,

737
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:47,300
but it's our camp and I wasn't paying attention,

738
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:48,340
so I just wanted to make you think

739
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:50,140
that I thought it was cool.

740
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,659
Is that I wasn't paying any attention.

741
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:58,319
They're talking about this is where we are right now.

742
02:04:58,319 --> 02:04:59,479
This would be our first destination.

743
02:04:59,479 --> 02:05:02,220
Ooh.

744
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:06,500
Why are we starting there?

745
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:09,140
I've detected a spot there with high energy readings.

746
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:13,779
The Neo One should be able to teleport to it.

747
02:05:13,779 --> 02:05:17,300
This island showed up in the travel log, right?

748
02:05:17,300 --> 02:05:18,420
Certainly did.

749
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:21,060
Captain Vince wrote that he saw a glowing Pokemon

750
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:23,600
there too, in fact.

751
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,739
Come on already, let's get this survey started.

752
02:05:26,739 --> 02:05:28,260
Fair enough.

753
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:30,260
Enjoy your first in a century adventure

754
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:37,359
into the wilds of Lental.

755
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:38,880
All right, what else?

756
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,920
Hoot Hoot's hidden foot.

757
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,920
Have you ever seen Hoot Hoot's other foot?

758
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:53,220
You should try to get a photo of it.

759
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:54,060
Not now.

760
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:57,420
New area unlocked.

761
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:58,779
Don't make a Warcraft reference.

762
02:05:58,779 --> 02:06:01,100
Don't make a, do not make a Warcraft reference.

763
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:05,100
Do not say, open up your M in World of Warcraft

764
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:08,909
and right click, right click, right click, right click.

765
02:06:08,909 --> 02:06:10,829
You have to right click like six times

766
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:13,909
to see the world in World of Warcraft.

767
02:06:13,909 --> 02:06:16,390
It's like zones inside of zones, inside of zones,

768
02:06:16,390 --> 02:06:20,300
inside of countries, inside of countries now.

769
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:33,340
I'm, look, I'm a Warcraft streamer.

770
02:06:33,340 --> 02:06:37,810
I've already talked about this.

771
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:40,329
It doesn't matter that I've not played WoW

772
02:06:40,329 --> 02:06:43,500
in a very, very long time.

773
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:48,100
All that matters is I dedicated like two plus years

774
02:06:48,100 --> 02:06:50,460
in front of the screen.

775
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,710
Like 500 days played in WoW.

776
02:06:54,710 --> 02:07:04,819
It's part of my life, like permanently.

777
02:07:04,819 --> 02:07:11,130
We got, we got, they have faces?

778
02:07:11,130 --> 02:07:12,970
I don't know.

779
02:07:12,970 --> 02:07:26,340
Whoa, there's a Woody the Woodpecker.

780
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:27,659
Whoa, what is that guy?

781
02:07:28,859 --> 02:07:30,100
That's Peter Griffin.

782
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:33,170
That's, hey!

783
02:07:33,170 --> 02:07:34,449
That's Peter Griffin in a costume.

784
02:07:34,449 --> 02:07:49,810
That's, I don't, it is.

785
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:51,960
Animal up there?

786
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,979
I'm gonna scan.

787
02:07:53,979 --> 02:07:55,619
Crystal Bloom, a crystal bloom that grows

788
02:07:55,619 --> 02:08:02,340
on Bilselvia Island.

789
02:08:02,340 --> 02:08:06,710
What are you gonna do?

790
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:16,210
What are you gonna do?

791
02:08:16,210 --> 02:08:23,489
Throw shit at him.

792
02:08:23,489 --> 02:08:31,590
That also could be Peter Griffin in a costume.

793
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:35,539
That's my favorite Pokemon.

794
02:08:35,539 --> 02:08:37,100
His name's Quagmire.

795
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:38,659
This is my favorite Pokemon.

796
02:08:38,659 --> 02:08:40,100
Is this one cool?

797
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:40,939
I like this one.

798
02:08:40,939 --> 02:08:54,010
That's actually my favorite Pokemon.

799
02:08:54,010 --> 02:09:00,460
Ah, eggs.

800
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:11,090
Ready to come eat those eggs.

801
02:09:11,090 --> 02:09:12,210
That wasn't even a good picture.

802
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:19,079
That was terrible.

803
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:22,699
Where is it?

804
02:09:22,699 --> 02:09:24,300
These ancient ruins are being engulfed

805
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:28,189
by an enormous tree.

806
02:09:28,189 --> 02:09:35,500
Shit.

807
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:42,270
I like this zone, this zone's cool.

808
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:44,090
Into the water?

809
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:46,369
This is gonna be like a, a, a, a, a,

810
02:09:46,369 --> 02:09:47,489
this is gonna, whatever.

811
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:52,420
This is gonna be something in here.

812
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:53,619
Come on, go for it.

813
02:09:53,619 --> 02:10:02,479
He's right there.

814
02:10:02,479 --> 02:10:06,020
I get it.

815
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:06,859
Jump out of the water.

816
02:10:06,859 --> 02:10:10,439
Whoa, you're asleep.

817
02:10:10,439 --> 02:10:20,619
Oh shit, I didn't even look.

818
02:10:20,619 --> 02:10:24,680
Missed the yawn.

819
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:29,359
That was a cool cat.

820
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:32,779
Those are french fries.

821
02:10:32,779 --> 02:10:35,659
Ha ha ha ha.

822
02:10:35,659 --> 02:10:42,819
Good picture, I liked it.

823
02:10:42,819 --> 02:10:51,460
Anybody want any fruits?

824
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:59,699
That Pokemon is the definition of a no thoughts head empty.

825
02:10:59,699 --> 02:11:01,420
They do just kind of sit there with their mouths open,

826
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:02,939
don't they?

827
02:11:02,939 --> 02:11:07,989
You like apples?

828
02:11:07,989 --> 02:11:11,199
Don't like apples.

829
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:16,060
Ha ha ha.

830
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:30,020
Come on, give me something through the trees here.

831
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:32,609
Oh well.

832
02:11:32,609 --> 02:11:42,560
Shit, come on, really?

833
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,340
What is that emote?

834
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,920
What is that?

835
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:54,819
Like a pizza, it's a Megalo pizza?

836
02:11:54,819 --> 02:12:02,430
What is that?

837
02:12:02,430 --> 02:12:07,260
It's the only one I have, so take it.

838
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:10,189
I mean, that's just better.

839
02:12:10,189 --> 02:12:13,210
Which one of these is the best?

840
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:17,489
Probably this one.

841
02:12:17,489 --> 02:12:20,090
Aw.

842
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,739
Ha ha ha.

843
02:12:21,739 --> 02:12:25,100
Wait, this one has another Pokemon in it though.

844
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:31,800
There's probably more points.

845
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:37,619
Aw, it's probably that one.

846
02:12:37,619 --> 02:12:41,210
Yeah, that one.

847
02:12:41,210 --> 02:12:47,680
That one, nope, that one.

848
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:50,670
Should I go for the four star?

849
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:58,930
I think so, if I have an opportunity, why not?

850
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:02,210
It's good to me.

851
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,210
One stars are easy to forget, that's true.

852
02:13:13,989 --> 02:13:20,369
Yeah, it's gonna be dog shit, I know, it don't matter.

853
02:13:20,369 --> 02:13:22,869
Why am I still playing this?

854
02:13:22,869 --> 02:13:31,710
Well, it's a very simple answer for you.

855
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:43,789
Because I'm having fun.

856
02:13:43,789 --> 02:13:47,539
Stop having fun, I'm not allowed.

857
02:13:47,539 --> 02:13:51,539
I'm having fun!

858
02:13:51,539 --> 02:13:52,380
Who cares?

859
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,460
You need to entertain us.

860
02:13:53,460 --> 02:14:10,970
I'm having fun, and I'm having fun.

861
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:12,649
Jatt hates games.

862
02:14:12,649 --> 02:14:17,079
Ha ha ha.

863
02:14:17,079 --> 02:14:18,319
I have, okay.

864
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:21,520
Is there a game that collectively everybody here liked?

865
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,449
I don't know if it's, I don't think so.

866
02:14:24,449 --> 02:14:25,770
Has there ever been a video game

867
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:31,340
that everyone here collectively actually enjoyed?

868
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:37,810
I'm not sure it's ever happened.

869
02:14:37,810 --> 02:14:39,960
Simpsons Hit and Run?

870
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:42,359
I don't think anybody liked that particular game

871
02:14:42,359 --> 02:14:47,989
as much as they liked people being angry at it.

872
02:14:47,989 --> 02:14:48,909
House Flipper?

873
02:14:48,909 --> 02:14:51,109
You know what, that's true.

874
02:14:51,109 --> 02:14:53,979
House Flipper is the one.

875
02:14:53,979 --> 02:14:55,020
People saying TF2?

876
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:56,939
Yeah, I haven't streamed TF2.

877
02:14:59,399 --> 02:15:09,920
I think I streamed TF2 like twice, like four years ago.

878
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:11,319
I love House Flipper.

879
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:16,199
What a great game.

880
02:15:16,199 --> 02:15:19,039
We all collectively hated Watch Dogs 3.

881
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:21,310
Oh yeah, so did I.

882
02:15:21,310 --> 02:15:29,029
That's probably the worst game I've ever played.

883
02:15:29,029 --> 02:15:32,149
Wait, can there be a category of worst games

884
02:15:32,149 --> 02:15:46,100
I've ever played that costed like $100 million to make?

885
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:54,050
Ooh, requests, what is it?

886
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:58,970
Most expensive disappointments.

887
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:01,390
What do we got?

888
02:16:01,390 --> 02:16:03,350
There's a Pokemon that's nowhere to be seen most of the time,

889
02:16:03,350 --> 02:16:05,750
but at night it sleeps beside Torterra.

890
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:07,590
Can you see if you can find it?

891
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:10,289
I already got that one, didn't I?

892
02:16:10,289 --> 02:16:15,020
An afternoon meal?

893
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:20,850
Wait, I have to get a photo of that?

894
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,289
No, that's just you sending me pictures.

895
02:16:22,289 --> 02:16:24,020
I don't want them.

896
02:16:24,020 --> 02:16:25,539
Hard one, happiness.

897
02:16:25,539 --> 02:16:27,939
Pidgeotto's cool, but it's kind of distant.

898
02:16:27,939 --> 02:16:31,310
Think it'd warm up to you for a fluff root?

899
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:37,649
Okay, did you get a picture of the Hoot Hoot foot?

900
02:16:37,649 --> 02:16:39,370
And then there's a Pokemon that sleeps in this area.

901
02:16:39,409 --> 02:16:41,129
Perhaps it would show itself where,

902
02:16:41,129 --> 02:16:47,049
if there were other Pokemon nearby, okay.

903
02:16:47,049 --> 02:16:58,659
I want to go to that jungle at night.

904
02:16:58,659 --> 02:16:59,620
Can I do it at night?

905
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,559
During the day.

906
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:03,520
All right, chow time.

907
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:08,610
Making a splash.

908
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:12,110
Yeah, I already did that one.

909
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:15,620
I'm a beginner, chow time.

910
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:17,620
Wait, who is this?

911
02:17:17,620 --> 02:17:20,049
How am I getting this?

912
02:17:20,049 --> 02:17:24,079
Oh, this is somebody's picture.

913
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:26,700
Oh, that was pretty cool.

914
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:32,370
Sweet, make some Reddit gold.

915
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:37,389
All right, I got to get a picture of him splashing.

916
02:17:37,389 --> 02:17:38,229
Report it.

917
02:17:38,229 --> 02:17:41,139
Why would there be a report function?

918
02:17:41,139 --> 02:17:43,590
It's on rails.

919
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:56,549
What would you possibly be doing to report a photo?

920
02:17:56,549 --> 02:18:11,620
Okay, zoom, zoom Andy, zoom Andy, zoom Andy, I know.

921
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:23,079
Somebody will find a way.

922
02:18:23,079 --> 02:18:25,959
Zoom.

923
02:18:25,959 --> 02:18:29,629
Oh, spider, is this a spider?

924
02:18:29,629 --> 02:18:34,799
Is this a spider Pokemon?

925
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:36,840
I need Peter Griffin's attention.

926
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:45,809
Get out of the way.

927
02:18:45,809 --> 02:18:49,100
It didn't work.

928
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:53,000
There are like three spider Pokemon, really?

929
02:18:53,760 --> 02:19:00,090
There's four of them, are there really?

930
02:19:00,090 --> 02:19:03,360
Wait, what's that?

931
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:04,959
Move out of the way, there's something over there.

932
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:08,319
Holy shit, it's a snake.

933
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:17,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

934
02:19:17,239 --> 02:19:18,360
Whoa, it eats the apples.

935
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:20,079
All right, hold on, come over here.

936
02:19:20,079 --> 02:19:26,170
Do it over here.

937
02:19:26,170 --> 02:19:32,959
Oh, that's a good one.

938
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:35,260
He's huge, he really is.

939
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:41,920
Ooh, good pose.

940
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:43,479
He posed right for the camera too.

941
02:19:43,479 --> 02:19:50,090
That's gonna be a good one.

942
02:19:50,090 --> 02:20:01,670
I need one of these guys jumping into the pool.

943
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:07,579
That snake was huge.

944
02:20:07,579 --> 02:20:16,000
All right, was that guy jump?

945
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:22,620
I should have scanned, my own fault.

946
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:23,739
Whoa, cool.

947
02:20:23,739 --> 02:20:32,079
All right, where's the, I need the lake.

948
02:20:32,079 --> 02:20:33,479
Something over here.

949
02:20:33,479 --> 02:20:40,940
Something nest over here.

950
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:41,780
What does it say?

951
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:51,989
Sega does what Nintendon't, right?

952
02:20:51,989 --> 02:21:11,729
Look over here.

953
02:21:11,729 --> 02:21:15,790
Sega does what Nintendon't.

954
02:21:15,790 --> 02:21:18,469
Genesis was fucking absolute dog shit

955
02:21:18,469 --> 02:21:21,100
compared to the Super Nintendo.

956
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:25,479
It was absolute dog shit in comparison.

957
02:21:25,479 --> 02:21:26,600
Hey guys, hey, hey, hey, it's me.

958
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,159
It's me, a Sega game.

959
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:33,159
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

960
02:21:33,639 --> 02:21:37,180
They all sounded like that.

961
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:47,340
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

962
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Super Nintendo had the cleaner audio

963
02:21:52,000 --> 02:22:05,819
and audio is half the way.

964
02:22:05,819 --> 02:22:12,780
What's over there?

965
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:15,870
What's my favorite smell?

966
02:22:15,870 --> 02:22:17,170
I don't know.

967
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:20,540
Favorite smell.

968
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:30,969
Um, come on, do something.

969
02:22:30,969 --> 02:22:38,260
Um, favorite smell.

970
02:22:38,260 --> 02:22:42,459
I'll tell you what my non-favorite smells are.

971
02:22:42,459 --> 02:22:43,979
Cinnamon apple.

972
02:22:43,979 --> 02:22:46,579
Cinnamon apple candles.

973
02:22:46,579 --> 02:22:51,340
Meh.

974
02:22:51,340 --> 02:22:53,379
Like apple pie candle.

975
02:22:53,379 --> 02:22:57,729
I don't like it.

976
02:22:57,729 --> 02:22:59,370
It's perfect, look at that one.

977
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:15,540
These both are actually really good.

978
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:18,500
It's the size.

979
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:23,879
All Walmart candles smell the same.

980
02:23:23,879 --> 02:23:26,709
Ooh, I like that one.

981
02:23:26,709 --> 02:23:31,319
That one, I like this one too.

982
02:23:31,319 --> 02:23:43,549
It's probably that one.

983
02:23:43,549 --> 02:23:45,229
So cute.

984
02:23:45,229 --> 02:23:46,510
Yeah, I like that one a lot.

985
02:23:46,549 --> 02:23:48,940
And this one.

986
02:23:48,940 --> 02:23:56,489
Perfect.

987
02:23:56,489 --> 02:24:00,049
And jumping into the water, which is the one that, um,

988
02:24:00,049 --> 02:24:01,170
is it this one here?

989
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:05,389
That's the one he wants, right?

990
02:24:05,389 --> 02:24:15,260
Or does he want the actual splash?

991
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:16,100
Sandalwood?

992
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:19,500
I'm gonna do you one up here.

993
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:22,270
Oud.

994
02:24:22,270 --> 02:24:25,389
Oud is one of my favorite scents.

995
02:24:25,389 --> 02:24:32,799
It was O-U-D, oud.

996
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,379
If you've never smelled oud before, O-U-D,

997
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:39,540
it's so, it's so wonderful.

998
02:24:39,540 --> 02:24:51,899
It's a wonderful scent.

999
02:24:51,899 --> 02:24:53,459
Perfume, the perfume,

1000
02:24:53,500 --> 02:24:54,659
I can't even say this.

1001
02:24:54,659 --> 02:24:57,700
The perfume, the perfume you have

1002
02:24:57,700 --> 02:25:01,579
is oud, vanilla, and wood?

1003
02:25:01,579 --> 02:25:05,700
That, you, I mean, that's fantastic.

1004
02:25:05,700 --> 02:25:09,870
I love the smell of wood too.

1005
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:12,860
I love the smell of wood.

1006
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:19,780
Not like a tree, like a wooden table.

1007
02:25:19,780 --> 02:25:23,940
All right, there are these dog treats.

1008
02:25:23,940 --> 02:25:26,940
They're these dog bones that they have this,

1009
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:28,059
they're made out of wood.

1010
02:25:28,059 --> 02:25:30,399
They have this wood smell.

1011
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:31,840
They smell incredible.

1012
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,850
They smell unbelievable.

1013
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:38,930
They're like these wood sticks for dogs,

1014
02:25:38,930 --> 02:25:42,270
and I just wanna smell them.

1015
02:25:42,270 --> 02:25:50,100
They smell incredible.

1016
02:25:50,100 --> 02:26:03,510
Better than the last one.

1017
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:06,399
Good photo, good pose, good size,

1018
02:26:06,399 --> 02:26:08,000
good direction, good placement.

1019
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I'll take a bronze.

1020
02:26:19,659 --> 02:26:21,340
Oh, not savory dog smell.

1021
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:22,860
I'm talking about, there's a,

1022
02:26:22,860 --> 02:26:26,850
it's like a wooden dog chew thing.

1023
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,010
I don't think it's actually made out of wood.

1024
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:32,899
It just smells like wood.

1025
02:26:32,899 --> 02:26:36,799
This is weird, fake, chemical wood smell.

1026
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:38,940
That's a great photo.

1027
02:26:38,940 --> 02:26:40,540
I've got two diamonds for the cat.

1028
02:27:01,299 --> 02:27:02,700
I'm not gonna say it.

1029
02:27:02,700 --> 02:27:04,139
It's fucking insane.

1030
02:27:04,139 --> 02:27:05,299
I can't say it.

1031
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:10,530
It's ridiculous.

1032
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:11,530
Which one's better?

1033
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:12,370
I like this one.

1034
02:27:21,059 --> 02:27:21,899
You sniff.

1035
02:27:30,219 --> 02:27:32,379
You're fucking driving me crazy.

1036
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:47,989
What do you got to report, Professor Mirror?

1037
02:27:47,989 --> 02:27:50,940
I'm not gonna say it.

1038
02:27:50,940 --> 02:27:53,100
I'm not gonna say it because it's fucked up

1039
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:54,579
and I'm not going to say it.

1040
02:28:01,420 --> 02:28:03,819
Say it or we leave.

1041
02:28:03,819 --> 02:28:05,100
No, I'm not gonna say it.

1042
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:11,780
I said the first part and it was something about wood.

1043
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:16,770
I'm not gonna say the whole thing together.

1044
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:17,729
Go to the jungle during the night

1045
02:28:17,729 --> 02:28:25,829
and photograph a crystal bloom glowing in the dark.

1046
02:28:25,829 --> 02:28:27,069
Get out of here.

1047
02:28:32,959 --> 02:28:36,139
You imagine like, this is,

1048
02:28:36,139 --> 02:28:37,299
look at this chat right now.

1049
02:28:37,299 --> 02:28:40,709
Look at this chat room.

1050
02:28:40,709 --> 02:28:43,100
What the hell is happening?

1051
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:47,020
You guys are gonna get me in trouble.

1052
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,299
No, I'm not, I'm not imagining.

1053
02:28:48,979 --> 02:28:51,379
I'm stop saying that.

1054
02:28:51,379 --> 02:28:53,219
I need to get this out of here.

1055
02:28:53,219 --> 02:28:54,059
I gotta get it out of here.

1056
02:28:54,059 --> 02:28:55,620
Okay, what do I say?

1057
02:28:55,620 --> 02:29:00,979
Shpee or coffee, Cheetos, chicken, shpee, shpee.

1058
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:12,090
Get it out, get it out, get it out.

1059
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:16,790
Probably the type we're after.

1060
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:22,090
We'll call it the bright state.

1061
02:29:22,090 --> 02:29:24,459
Do we need to do anything special if we find one?

1062
02:29:24,459 --> 02:29:27,059
Not particularly, just snap a photo of it.

1063
02:29:27,059 --> 02:29:31,979
Your camera can analyze it for you.

1064
02:29:31,979 --> 02:29:38,420
Enjoy the nighttime jungle.

1065
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:42,649
Ron.

1066
02:29:42,649 --> 02:29:44,290
In the comfort and safety of its own territory,

1067
02:29:44,290 --> 02:29:47,010
even the warriest Pokemon will let its guard down

1068
02:29:47,010 --> 02:29:49,370
to eat a tasty fruit.

1069
02:29:49,370 --> 02:29:54,899
Wow.

1070
02:29:54,899 --> 02:29:56,059
Oh, cool.

1071
02:29:56,059 --> 02:30:01,000
Whoa, how'd you get that?

1072
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,940
I am so pro gamer.

1073
02:30:06,940 --> 02:30:13,889
I took this photo.

1074
02:30:13,889 --> 02:30:17,610
How'd you get that?

1075
02:30:17,610 --> 02:30:18,530
How'd you do this?

1076
02:30:36,479 --> 02:30:38,879
Okay, what are we doing at night?

1077
02:30:38,879 --> 02:30:39,719
I don't know.

1078
02:30:51,319 --> 02:30:52,479
So fucked up.

1079
02:30:54,700 --> 02:31:08,790
Shit, that was awful.

1080
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:10,469
We're glowing?

1081
02:31:10,469 --> 02:31:15,239
Where's the bloom?

1082
02:31:15,239 --> 02:31:17,379
We, you started it.

1083
02:31:17,379 --> 02:31:18,459
I did not start it.

1084
02:31:18,459 --> 02:31:22,260
I just told you that I like the smell of my dog's toys.

1085
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:29,299
I like the smell of my dog's wooden toy.

1086
02:31:29,299 --> 02:31:31,139
He has a toy that's wooden.

1087
02:31:31,139 --> 02:31:32,420
It smells like wood.

1088
02:31:32,420 --> 02:31:37,260
I hate this.

1089
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:49,889
My dog has a toy.

1090
02:31:49,889 --> 02:31:51,649
It's a stick.

1091
02:31:51,649 --> 02:31:55,049
It came in a package and you open up the package

1092
02:31:55,049 --> 02:31:57,729
and it's made out of like tree, like wood.

1093
02:31:57,729 --> 02:31:58,569
It's wood.

1094
02:31:58,569 --> 02:32:01,700
There's the spider.

1095
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:09,819
Spider's like apples.

1096
02:32:09,819 --> 02:32:12,350
Get a photo of a crystal bloom, right?

1097
02:32:12,350 --> 02:32:17,110
That's a crystal bloom right there.

1098
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:35,190
Oh, oh, it has to be glowing.

1099
02:32:35,190 --> 02:32:45,020
Cute, snoozing in the tree.

1100
02:32:45,020 --> 02:32:52,000
It's like an invader's zim.

1101
02:32:52,000 --> 02:33:00,159
Turn and look, turn and look, oh.

1102
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:01,000
He eat apples?

1103
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,020
Oh, he's eating.

1104
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,979
Show the toy, show the toy.

1105
02:33:05,979 --> 02:33:17,590
I will, I will show it.

1106
02:33:18,229 --> 02:33:26,139
I need a glowing crystal.

1107
02:33:26,139 --> 02:33:32,149
Wrong button.

1108
02:33:32,149 --> 02:33:35,170
Ooh, that's cool.

1109
02:33:35,170 --> 02:33:42,920
Can I get them to move?

1110
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:48,950
That was cute.

1111
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:54,239
Pato, oh, Pato, oh, there's Pato.

1112
02:33:54,239 --> 02:33:56,659
I was not even paying attention.

1113
02:33:56,659 --> 02:34:05,149
Could have got a cool action photo.

1114
02:34:05,149 --> 02:34:13,020
All right, crystal.

1115
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:19,590
I hear something flapping, something flapping.

1116
02:34:19,590 --> 02:34:22,409
Good photo.

1117
02:34:22,409 --> 02:34:23,889
Oh, there's this one.

1118
02:34:23,889 --> 02:34:26,379
All right, throw an apple at it.

1119
02:34:26,379 --> 02:34:32,860
That didn't do anything.

1120
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:44,860
Wow, wow, wow.

1121
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:46,600
That's not doing anything.

1122
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:49,520
Is there one glowing over here?

1123
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:54,020
There's one glowing over there.

1124
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:55,649
Move out of the way.

1125
02:34:55,649 --> 02:35:06,799
Move out of the way, move out of the way.

1126
02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:17,930
I want to go in his mouth with a photo.

1127
02:35:17,930 --> 02:35:21,879
Turn, you guys like apples?

1128
02:35:21,879 --> 02:35:34,850
You like apples?

1129
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:41,319
One of those will work.

1130
02:35:41,319 --> 02:35:43,479
Just make the armpit fart noise already.

1131
02:35:43,479 --> 02:35:47,430
All right, fine.

1132
02:35:47,430 --> 02:36:04,579
That hurt, I can't do it.

1133
02:36:04,579 --> 02:36:07,719
I already have one of these, this one's way worse.

1134
02:36:07,719 --> 02:36:09,239
Do I have any, did you hear my mouth?

1135
02:36:09,239 --> 02:36:11,340
It was like.

1136
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:14,170
Nothing's gonna compare with that one.

1137
02:36:14,170 --> 02:36:17,590
I mean, the sleeping one's cool, but no.

1138
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:23,860
All right, this is four in the same shot.

1139
02:36:23,860 --> 02:36:27,260
That's probably what they want.

1140
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:31,709
This is cuter, but this one is probably more points.

1141
02:36:31,709 --> 02:36:42,809
All right, I don't have any pictures of this.

1142
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:47,020
That one's good.

1143
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:52,059
This is a picture of him.

1144
02:36:52,059 --> 02:36:55,180
Oh, that one's cute.

1145
02:36:55,180 --> 02:36:56,889
I like this one.

1146
02:36:56,889 --> 02:37:03,219
Looks like he's balancing it on his nose.

1147
02:37:03,219 --> 02:37:07,739
It's this one.

1148
02:37:07,739 --> 02:37:11,129
I got a couple of really good ones here.

1149
02:37:11,129 --> 02:37:16,719
That one, that one, that one.

1150
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:20,680
I'm gonna go with this one.

1151
02:37:20,680 --> 02:37:35,100
And a still bloom, glowing, got it.

1152
02:37:35,180 --> 02:37:37,559
Graphics kinda suck.

1153
02:37:37,559 --> 02:37:40,989
Um, I mean, it's the switch though.

1154
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,440
Guys, don't you know,

1155
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:48,319
Nintendo still bases their graphical power

1156
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:51,200
on being like two and a half times more powerful

1157
02:37:51,200 --> 02:38:00,010
than the GameCube.

1158
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:11,940
That's a good picture.

1159
02:38:11,940 --> 02:38:15,559
It looks better than sword and shield.

1160
02:38:15,559 --> 02:38:19,079
People didn't like that, did they?

1161
02:38:19,079 --> 02:38:20,959
I've not heard very good things about that.

1162
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:25,139
I heard people really didn't like it.

1163
02:38:25,139 --> 02:38:25,979
All right, this is the big one here.

1164
02:38:25,979 --> 02:38:31,479
This is gonna be, that's gonna be gold or diamond.

1165
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:33,040
Oh, silver.

1166
02:38:37,020 --> 02:38:41,620
Every gen past three is shit.

1167
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:46,350
I don't even know what gen three is.

1168
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:49,069
All I know is that I got Pokemon Diamond

1169
02:38:49,069 --> 02:38:50,870
for the Nintendo DS.

1170
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:53,190
I don't know why it came out

1171
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:54,510
and I just, for some reason, bought it.

1172
02:38:54,510 --> 02:38:58,420
I'd never played a Pokemon game ever before.

1173
02:38:58,420 --> 02:38:59,979
And I played it for about an hour

1174
02:38:59,979 --> 02:39:08,299
and then I just never played it ever again.

1175
02:39:08,299 --> 02:39:10,329
That's gen three.

1176
02:39:10,329 --> 02:39:13,969
I heard Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were the,

1177
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,959
those, that's like the best one, right?

1178
02:39:16,959 --> 02:39:17,799
Everybody loves that.

1179
02:39:17,799 --> 02:39:19,159
Isn't that everybody's favorite?

1180
02:39:19,159 --> 02:39:24,239
Besides like green leaf and red, whatever.

1181
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:28,100
That's everybody's favorite, I thought.

1182
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:32,809
That's the first 5K I think I've gotten.

1183
02:39:32,809 --> 02:39:39,590
Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum are all gen four.

1184
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:44,100
Gen two is the best.

1185
02:39:44,100 --> 02:39:49,379
That's gen four.

1186
02:39:49,379 --> 02:39:54,819
I simp for two and three, but four is objectively better.

1187
02:39:54,819 --> 02:40:09,530
All right, Pokemon sucks.

1188
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:15,989
That's just in there in the sea of comments.

1189
02:40:16,030 --> 02:40:23,209
Ooh, you registered seven bugs.

1190
02:40:23,209 --> 02:40:26,899
Best Pokemon game is the one you played as a kid.

1191
02:40:26,899 --> 02:40:28,889
Now that, you get it.

1192
02:40:28,889 --> 02:40:40,430
You get it.

1193
02:40:40,430 --> 02:40:43,700
So what was the problem with Sword and Shield?

1194
02:40:44,579 --> 02:40:47,260
So every time they do a new Pokemon game,

1195
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:57,979
they add another like 150 Pokemon, right?

1196
02:40:57,979 --> 02:40:59,739
True, what did I do, what did I say?

1197
02:40:59,739 --> 02:41:01,420
Nothing, it's perfectly fine.

1198
02:41:07,670 --> 02:41:14,049
They didn't advance the series, there was no effort.

1199
02:41:14,049 --> 02:41:16,489
Nothing bad, just literally nothing new.

1200
02:41:16,489 --> 02:41:20,649
Sword and Shield removed a lot of core features.

1201
02:41:20,649 --> 02:41:30,700
They cut half the Pokemon, it was boring.

1202
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:32,620
Those orb thingies you've been working on, Professor,

1203
02:41:32,620 --> 02:41:34,079
that's those.

1204
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:36,360
Ugly, stupid, stinky game.

1205
02:41:36,360 --> 02:41:42,440
Whatever, now I got you guys talking.

1206
02:41:42,440 --> 02:41:44,850
Now I got you guys interested.

1207
02:41:44,850 --> 02:41:47,969
All I had to say was, what's your favorite Pokemon, Gen?

1208
02:41:47,969 --> 02:41:53,750
And all of you woke up at the same time.

1209
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:56,389
Somebody asked what my favorite Pokemon was?

1210
02:41:56,389 --> 02:41:58,750
It's very easy, it's Mewtwo.

1211
02:41:58,750 --> 02:42:01,350
He's the only one that can talk besides Meowth,

1212
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:04,819
and he's just stronger and cooler than Meowth.

1213
02:42:04,819 --> 02:42:16,649
It's Mewtwo, it's the best Pokemon.

1214
02:42:16,649 --> 02:42:18,489
Lucario can talk.

1215
02:42:18,489 --> 02:42:21,260
No, he can't.

1216
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:22,780
I suspect it's because different areas of Lentil

1217
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:27,639
have distinct types of energy flowing through them.

1218
02:42:27,639 --> 02:42:28,959
For now, I want to see the fruits of your,

1219
02:42:28,959 --> 02:42:30,719
oh wait, he can talk.

1220
02:42:30,719 --> 02:42:32,799
What does he say, he says like,

1221
02:42:32,799 --> 02:42:36,840
no, not, not, not, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.

1222
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:39,079
Chaos, what, no, what is it?

1223
02:42:39,079 --> 02:42:44,459
He says something.

1224
02:42:44,459 --> 02:42:51,329
What does Lucario say when he does something?

1225
02:42:51,329 --> 02:42:54,020
All of them can talk.

1226
02:42:54,059 --> 02:42:56,659
Chaos control, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.

1227
02:42:56,659 --> 02:43:02,370
Lucario says something when he does like a power.

1228
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:03,770
He just says Lucario.

1229
02:43:05,770 --> 02:43:09,370
No, he talks, doesn't he?

1230
02:43:09,370 --> 02:43:11,610
Lucario says chaos control, what?

1231
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:29,940
No, that's Shadow the Hedgehog.

1232
02:43:29,940 --> 02:43:31,700
Am I gaslighting myself?

1233
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:36,920
What is, it's Shadow the Hedgehog, right?

1234
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:39,209
Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.

1235
02:43:39,209 --> 02:43:41,770
Wow, Lentil's very own light show.

1236
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:44,069
What did you call it again?

1237
02:43:44,069 --> 02:43:47,340
The Illumina Phenomenon?

1238
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,420
It's interesting how it can occur

1239
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:52,719
in both Pokemon and planets.

1240
02:43:52,719 --> 02:43:55,040
You can use these orbs to send Pokemon and Crystal Blooms

1241
02:43:55,040 --> 02:44:02,559
into the Illumina state for a while.

1242
02:44:02,559 --> 02:44:07,059
When you do, watch for changes in their surroundings.

1243
02:44:07,059 --> 02:44:09,020
You're gaslighting yourself, I,

1244
02:44:09,020 --> 02:44:11,399
but you guys are like helping me.

1245
02:44:11,399 --> 02:44:13,399
I have a blindfold on,

1246
02:44:13,399 --> 02:44:18,340
and you guys are guiding me around to gaslight myself.

1247
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:20,899
This is pinned, this is like,

1248
02:44:20,899 --> 02:44:27,200
what's that, like, there's like a pinata hanging down.

1249
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,799
And you guys, I have a blindfold on,

1250
02:44:28,799 --> 02:44:30,959
and like as a joke, you like turned me around

1251
02:44:30,959 --> 02:44:34,459
and like moved me down like the driveway.

1252
02:44:34,459 --> 02:44:38,219
And you're like, hey, your pinata's right in front of you.

1253
02:44:38,219 --> 02:44:40,420
And I'm like, swinging and just missing,

1254
02:44:40,420 --> 02:44:46,139
and I don't understand, and everyone's laughing.

1255
02:44:46,139 --> 02:44:48,860
And it's really funny until I take out the light post

1256
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:50,260
and fucking down the driveway.

1257
02:44:50,260 --> 02:44:52,059
And it's real funny now, isn't it?

1258
02:44:52,059 --> 02:44:54,239
Do I have to pay for that?

1259
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:55,940
Do I pay for that?

1260
02:44:55,979 --> 02:44:57,260
When I take the blindfold off

1261
02:44:57,260 --> 02:44:58,979
and I fucking hit your mailbox,

1262
02:44:58,979 --> 02:45:01,020
do I have to pay for that?

1263
02:45:01,020 --> 02:45:07,579
I don't believe I do, I don't think so.

1264
02:45:07,579 --> 02:45:18,290
All right, so now I can turn on those lights.

1265
02:45:18,290 --> 02:45:19,690
Please record yourself doing that

1266
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:21,010
on a part of a green screen.

1267
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:23,010
What, with like a blindfold saying like,

1268
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:24,170
oh, where's the pinata?

1269
02:45:27,889 --> 02:45:29,889
Oh, I'm sad that doesn't already exist.

1270
02:45:40,229 --> 02:45:42,850
Okay, dinner time.

1271
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:47,739
Sir McFluff loves Fluffies.

1272
02:45:47,739 --> 02:45:52,899
How come this is so cool, I like these.

1273
02:45:52,899 --> 02:45:57,459
Dinner time, as everybody has them eating the apples.

1274
02:45:57,459 --> 02:46:00,399
That's the meta right now.

1275
02:46:00,399 --> 02:46:04,260
This game is so new that the Pokemon eating apples

1276
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:17,110
is the current most upvoted meta.

1277
02:46:17,110 --> 02:46:19,389
I'm gonna take a picture of a Pokemon

1278
02:46:19,389 --> 02:46:22,250
with an apple in front of them.

1279
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:23,889
And I'm gonna try to get them biting into it.

1280
02:46:23,889 --> 02:46:25,329
And I'm gonna zoom in,

1281
02:46:25,329 --> 02:46:30,430
and I'm gonna put like snackies underneath it or something.

1282
02:46:30,430 --> 02:46:32,870
And I bet you that's the highest upvoted thing I have.

1283
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:42,049
Stop meta gaming, why not?

1284
02:46:42,049 --> 02:46:44,500
All right, what are the requests here?

1285
02:46:44,500 --> 02:46:46,020
I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering,

1286
02:46:46,059 --> 02:46:48,500
do you think Arbok ever falls out of its tree

1287
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:51,500
while it's sleeping?

1288
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:52,340
Should I try to get a picture?

1289
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:53,750
Okay.

1290
02:46:53,750 --> 02:46:55,540
Whoa, Toucans.

1291
02:46:55,540 --> 02:47:00,700
I haven't seen Hickey Peck flying near Toucanon's nest.

1292
02:47:00,700 --> 02:47:04,909
What do you suppose they're up to?

1293
02:47:04,909 --> 02:47:07,219
That's just a Toucan.

1294
02:47:07,219 --> 02:47:08,620
I understand that Pokemons are supposed to be

1295
02:47:08,620 --> 02:47:10,680
kind of like animals and stuff,

1296
02:47:10,680 --> 02:47:14,659
but that's a Toucan, that's not Toucanon.

1297
02:47:14,659 --> 02:47:18,950
That's just a Toucan.

1298
02:47:18,950 --> 02:47:24,729
Why can't you just say it's near the Toucan's nest?

1299
02:47:24,729 --> 02:47:28,260
It has a gun, it has a cannon.

1300
02:47:28,659 --> 02:47:29,899
They're getting lazy.

1301
02:47:31,959 --> 02:47:35,360
It's just a couple, like a golden retriever runs by.

1302
02:47:35,360 --> 02:47:40,000
Oh, that's Goldidio, Goldidio.

1303
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:47,100
That's the one right there.

1304
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:48,799
All right, I'll go for it.

1305
02:47:48,799 --> 02:47:49,920
Let's go back during the day.

1306
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:55,780
I wanna try to get the Toucan.

1307
02:47:55,780 --> 02:48:01,250
There's a Corgi.

1308
02:48:01,250 --> 02:48:05,260
Well, here, you have to give a little bit of credit though.

1309
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:08,700
Do you really, how hard do you think it is eventually here

1310
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:12,659
to create Pokemon for like the 15th generation

1311
02:48:14,139 --> 02:48:14,979
or whatever?

1312
02:48:14,979 --> 02:48:17,299
Oh shit, okay, we're gonna have like a little monkey.

1313
02:48:17,299 --> 02:48:18,659
We already have like five of those,

1314
02:48:18,659 --> 02:48:21,649
but have him have like a weird tail this time.

1315
02:48:21,649 --> 02:48:33,020
We have like 30 moths, but make this moth sing.

1316
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:41,030
All right, where's this Toucan nest?

1317
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:42,190
I think that guy's awake.

1318
02:48:42,190 --> 02:48:43,829
What the hell is that thing?

1319
02:48:43,829 --> 02:48:44,670
What is that thing?

1320
02:48:44,670 --> 02:48:45,489
What is that?

1321
02:48:45,489 --> 02:48:46,889
That's a rare.

1322
02:48:46,889 --> 02:48:57,450
That was a rare and I just didn't even get a picture of it.

1323
02:48:57,450 --> 02:48:58,489
Look at this guy.

1324
02:48:58,489 --> 02:49:01,209
What the hell is that thing?

1325
02:49:01,209 --> 02:49:03,379
That's a sock.

1326
02:49:03,379 --> 02:49:05,500
Oh, that's not its face.

1327
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:06,540
That's not its face.

1328
02:49:06,579 --> 02:49:18,319
I thought it was like a big sock puppet.

1329
02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:21,139
Holy shit, he's right next to me.

1330
02:49:21,139 --> 02:49:28,209
Don't be concerned.

1331
02:49:28,209 --> 02:49:32,620
What's that?

1332
02:49:32,620 --> 02:49:33,440
That's the one they were giving away.

1333
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:37,260
This is the one they were giving away for free, right?

1334
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:47,549
During the, what was it, not E3.

1335
02:49:47,549 --> 02:49:51,000
That's a Wooper watch right there, yeah.

1336
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:57,420
Okay, where's this Toucan?

1337
02:49:57,420 --> 02:50:01,379
I almost hit him.

1338
02:50:01,379 --> 02:50:04,790
Where's the Toucan nest?

1339
02:50:04,790 --> 02:50:11,950
Hey, go look at the Toucan nest.

1340
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:20,729
Hmm, I don't see a Toucan nest.

1341
02:50:20,729 --> 02:50:25,270
Wait, okay, there's the Toucan.

1342
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:30,920
What was I supposed to be filming here?

1343
02:50:30,959 --> 02:50:33,920
Whoa, can I get you jumping?

1344
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:37,459
I wanna get you jumping off this.

1345
02:50:37,459 --> 02:50:39,870
He's gonna do a jump.

1346
02:50:39,870 --> 02:50:40,950
Jump?

1347
02:50:40,950 --> 02:50:54,170
Holy shit, did I get it?

1348
02:50:54,170 --> 02:51:01,479
What photo am I trying to get here?

1349
02:51:01,479 --> 02:51:06,620
What was I trying to get?

1350
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:21,489
Oh, Snacky's right.

1351
02:51:21,489 --> 02:51:22,329
It is just a Toucan.

1352
02:51:22,329 --> 02:51:24,030
Yeah, it is.

1353
02:51:24,030 --> 02:51:25,629
You can have other animals in the universe.

1354
02:51:25,629 --> 02:51:34,040
I don't know why they all have to be Pokemon.

1355
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:36,040
All right, Germamites, it's that time of the stream again.

1356
02:51:36,040 --> 02:51:38,719
Can we get a Wubba Lubba Dub Dub in the chat right now?

1357
02:51:38,719 --> 02:51:41,270
I hope so.

1358
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:43,430
Yeah, because people are gonna really think you're funny

1359
02:51:43,430 --> 02:51:45,709
or you just got blocked.

1360
02:51:46,629 --> 02:51:57,670
I like 10,000 people.

1361
02:51:57,670 --> 02:51:59,559
Come on, Snacky's.

1362
02:51:59,559 --> 02:52:03,700
Come on, let me give me a Snacky's.

1363
02:52:03,700 --> 02:52:04,540
What about you?

1364
02:52:04,540 --> 02:52:08,549
Will you do a Snacky's?

1365
02:52:08,549 --> 02:52:09,629
Give me a Snacky's.

1366
02:52:09,629 --> 02:52:12,200
Here it comes, come on.

1367
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:14,719
Oh, that's perfect, Snacky's.

1368
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:15,680
That's gonna be perfect.

1369
02:52:15,680 --> 02:52:29,200
I want that one.

1370
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:30,639
I still don't understand how this works.

1371
02:52:30,639 --> 02:52:44,780
Probably should have paid attention.

1372
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:46,879
Eat?

1373
02:52:46,879 --> 02:52:47,719
What do you think?

1374
02:52:47,719 --> 02:52:48,930
Apple?

1375
02:52:48,930 --> 02:52:51,549
I don't get it.

1376
02:52:51,549 --> 02:52:54,110
Cats not like apples?

1377
02:52:54,110 --> 02:53:03,790
I guess not.

1378
02:53:03,790 --> 02:53:05,469
People forget that these Pokemon attack

1379
02:53:05,469 --> 02:53:09,540
could kill each other out in the wild.

1380
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:10,379
That's what I was saying.

1381
02:53:10,379 --> 02:53:11,360
They're like cartoons.

1382
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:23,809
They're not even animals.

1383
02:53:23,809 --> 02:53:24,930
Okay, what am I missing?

1384
02:53:24,930 --> 02:53:27,489
I'm not gonna replace that one.

1385
02:53:27,489 --> 02:53:31,590
I mean, that one's kind of funny.

1386
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:34,120
This one even has the right animal.

1387
02:53:34,120 --> 02:53:39,100
That one's better, but yeah, we'll do this one.

1388
02:53:39,100 --> 02:53:42,000
Eh, how could that be possibly better?

1389
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,340
I got the jumping one.

1390
02:53:44,340 --> 02:53:50,010
Oh, what?

1391
02:53:50,010 --> 02:53:55,290
That's not a three star?

1392
02:53:55,290 --> 02:53:59,780
I really thought, I really thought it was that.

1393
02:53:59,780 --> 02:54:01,860
Oh, it fooled me.

1394
02:54:01,860 --> 02:54:05,739
I'm a stupid animal.

1395
02:54:05,739 --> 02:54:07,260
That's what that thing is there for.

1396
02:54:07,299 --> 02:54:10,299
It's to scare other animals.

1397
02:54:10,299 --> 02:54:18,129
I fell for it, yeah.

1398
02:54:18,129 --> 02:54:26,100
None of these are as good.

1399
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:29,719
That's a good one right there.

1400
02:54:29,719 --> 02:54:31,639
How's that one?

1401
02:54:31,639 --> 02:54:33,000
I'm gonna have to go with the good one though.

1402
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,600
Actually, this one might be, this one's far better.

1403
02:54:35,600 --> 02:54:36,799
This is a three star, but it's not,

1404
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:37,639
it's kind of off center.

1405
02:54:37,639 --> 02:54:39,969
This one's perfect.

1406
02:54:39,969 --> 02:54:44,129
We'll go with the, we'll go with the two.

1407
02:54:45,329 --> 02:54:47,680
No, it's not better.

1408
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:48,520
Here we go.

1409
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:49,420
Snackies!

1410
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:50,819
Oh my God, perfect.

1411
02:54:50,819 --> 02:54:51,659
This is the one.

1412
02:54:51,659 --> 02:55:05,639
This is the one that's gonna get a thousand upvotes.

1413
02:55:05,639 --> 02:55:06,479
That one's good.

1414
02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:08,420
That one's better.

1415
02:55:09,100 --> 02:55:13,469
Okay, what did he want?

1416
02:55:13,469 --> 02:55:20,909
What was the actual, I don't know what he's,

1417
02:55:20,909 --> 02:55:25,079
what did he want?

1418
02:55:25,079 --> 02:55:29,610
He wanted this one, okay?

1419
02:55:29,610 --> 02:55:33,159
And then a crystal bloom.

1420
02:55:33,159 --> 02:55:44,520
Cool.

1421
02:55:44,520 --> 02:55:45,799
Cooking tacos while watching this?

1422
02:55:45,799 --> 02:55:47,239
How hot are they?

1423
02:55:47,239 --> 02:55:48,440
Are they gonna be hot?

1424
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:51,020
Are they gonna be mild?

1425
02:55:51,020 --> 02:55:53,100
That determines if you get banned from the channel or not.

1426
02:55:53,100 --> 02:56:02,549
Let's find out.

1427
02:56:02,549 --> 02:56:05,120
That second photo's perfect.

1428
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:06,799
They're gonna be fucking hot.

1429
02:56:06,799 --> 02:56:16,280
All right, good game.

1430
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:25,399
Okay, two diamonds.

1431
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:27,920
All right, here we go.

1432
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:29,120
Is this one better?

1433
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:29,959
Yes, it is.

1434
02:56:29,959 --> 02:56:32,069
Way better.

1435
02:56:32,069 --> 02:56:35,430
Yeah, and we're keeping this one.

1436
02:56:35,430 --> 02:56:36,590
And I mean permanently,

1437
02:56:36,590 --> 02:56:47,829
because that's the ultimate snackies photo.

1438
02:56:47,829 --> 02:56:54,569
Is that the one he wanted?

1439
02:56:54,569 --> 02:57:00,510
Didn't fulfill the request?

1440
02:57:00,510 --> 02:57:01,350
Level three.

1441
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:15,430
You registered 10 species of normal type.

1442
02:57:15,430 --> 02:57:18,430
Okay, save photos to album.

1443
02:57:18,430 --> 02:57:19,270
It's in this one.

1444
02:57:19,270 --> 02:57:21,500
Where is it?

1445
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:23,170
There it is.

1446
02:57:23,170 --> 02:57:24,010
Perfect.

1447
02:57:24,010 --> 02:57:24,850
Resnap.

1448
02:57:26,270 --> 02:57:31,219
Okay, what do I have of filters?

1449
02:57:31,219 --> 02:57:39,719
What the hell?

1450
02:57:45,340 --> 02:57:50,719
Can't improve perfection.

1451
02:57:50,719 --> 02:58:01,079
But you can.

1452
02:58:01,079 --> 02:58:02,639
I wanna put filters on it.

1453
02:58:02,639 --> 02:58:08,149
Maximum blur.

1454
02:58:08,149 --> 02:58:17,620
That like just hurts my head looking at this.

1455
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:23,139
This hurts my head.

1456
02:58:23,139 --> 02:58:26,680
Too much blur, I don't like it.

1457
02:58:26,680 --> 02:58:27,760
Raid song.

1458
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:30,000
Sing the raid song?

1459
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,510
What happened?

1460
02:58:33,510 --> 02:58:39,030
I think there's a desktop background.

1461
02:58:39,030 --> 02:58:39,870
They get raided?

1462
02:58:39,870 --> 02:58:40,709
Who raided?

1463
02:58:40,709 --> 02:58:43,959
Where?

1464
02:58:43,959 --> 02:58:49,700
What are my last updates from seven days ago?

1465
02:58:49,700 --> 02:58:52,629
Where's the raid?

1466
02:58:52,629 --> 02:58:55,120
I can't see.

1467
02:58:55,120 --> 02:58:56,489
Who raided?

1468
02:58:56,489 --> 02:58:58,319
You get a raid?

1469
02:58:58,319 --> 02:58:59,159
Thank you.

1470
02:58:59,799 --> 02:59:00,639
Thank you for the raid.

1471
02:59:00,639 --> 02:59:01,479
Whoever it was, I can't see.

1472
02:59:01,479 --> 02:59:06,360
Why can I not see this?

1473
02:59:06,360 --> 02:59:07,780
I'm gonna go pee.

1474
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:10,000
First break of the day.

1475
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:13,010
I'm being trolled, okay.

1476
02:59:13,010 --> 02:59:14,049
All right, I'll be right back.

1477
02:59:14,049 --> 02:59:16,399
I'm gonna pee.

1478
02:59:16,399 --> 02:59:19,579
When I come back, we're gonna complete Snackies.

1479
02:59:19,579 --> 02:59:24,069
I'm gonna be the most famous Pokemon Snap Guy.

1480
02:59:24,069 --> 03:04:11,840
I'll be right back.

1481
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:14,639
Okay, hello.

1482
03:04:14,639 --> 03:04:24,819
I have returned.

1483
03:04:24,819 --> 03:04:29,069
Let's come back.

1484
03:04:29,069 --> 03:04:33,170
Is it working?

1485
03:04:33,170 --> 03:04:35,920
Why can't I switch?

1486
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:37,239
There we go, okay.

1487
03:04:37,239 --> 03:04:39,040
All right, I got that saved.

1488
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:41,540
I have Snackies saved.

1489
03:04:41,579 --> 03:04:49,600
I'll be uploading that later.

1490
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:51,559
Pissed off a 2K raid.

1491
03:04:51,559 --> 03:04:54,159
I didn't see anything.

1492
03:04:54,159 --> 03:04:58,379
I, who was it?

1493
03:04:58,379 --> 03:05:02,719
You missed the raid for real.

1494
03:05:02,719 --> 03:05:03,719
No, you're liars.

1495
03:05:03,719 --> 03:05:10,799
Nobody, there's nobody here.

1496
03:05:10,799 --> 03:05:12,440
Wait, was it actually a raid?

1497
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:16,209
Are you guys fucking with me the whole time?

1498
03:05:16,209 --> 03:05:23,280
Hold on, I need to check.

1499
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:28,010
Hold on, I gotta switch my inputs.

1500
03:05:28,010 --> 03:05:33,760
Let me see.

1501
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:38,840
Are you guys messing with me here?

1502
03:05:38,840 --> 03:05:40,159
Oh my God, that was a raid.

1503
03:05:40,159 --> 03:05:41,120
It was a big one.

1504
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:42,159
It was a big one.

1505
03:05:42,159 --> 03:05:44,280
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1506
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:47,079
I'm so sorry, oh my God.

1507
03:05:47,079 --> 03:05:49,399
I thought everyone was fucking around.

1508
03:05:49,399 --> 03:05:52,100
It didn't pop up on my dashboard.

1509
03:05:52,100 --> 03:05:54,100
This is from Jess, Jess, Jessu.

1510
03:05:54,100 --> 03:06:00,079
Thank you for the 2,600 person raid.

1511
03:06:00,079 --> 03:06:02,200
If you still, I like went BRB.

1512
03:06:02,200 --> 03:06:04,079
I was just like, oh, you guys are full of shit.

1513
03:06:04,079 --> 03:06:05,559
And I took off.

1514
03:06:05,559 --> 03:06:10,780
Oh my God, that's, I'm sorry.

1515
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:12,059
Well, thank you so much.

1516
03:06:13,559 --> 03:06:18,260
And Frans too, I got, I had a raid from Frans.

1517
03:06:18,260 --> 03:06:19,780
Thank you, I'm really sorry.

1518
03:06:19,780 --> 03:06:21,860
I thought I, people do that sometimes.

1519
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:24,579
They're like, oh, hey raid, a raid's coming in.

1520
03:06:24,579 --> 03:06:26,139
You're getting raided.

1521
03:06:26,139 --> 03:06:28,620
Joe Biden raid, Joe Biden's raiding.

1522
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:35,090
And I'm like, I've tuned it out by this point.

1523
03:06:35,090 --> 03:06:36,569
But thank you, welcome if you're still here

1524
03:06:36,569 --> 03:06:39,049
or if you just left, cause like I'm an asshole

1525
03:06:39,049 --> 03:06:42,450
and a raid came in and I just fucking said, nice joke.

1526
03:06:42,450 --> 03:06:44,969
Nobody raided and then went to the bathroom.

1527
03:06:44,969 --> 03:06:46,329
I look awful right now.

1528
03:06:46,329 --> 03:06:49,209
Can we just make, hey Mike, can I apologize

1529
03:06:49,209 --> 03:06:52,049
to the Jess, the Jess community?

1530
03:06:52,090 --> 03:06:53,209
Please, I'm sorry.

1531
03:06:53,209 --> 03:07:00,469
I did not mean to do that.

1532
03:07:00,469 --> 03:07:01,510
Anyways, welcome, how you doing?

1533
03:07:01,510 --> 03:07:08,680
Hope you had a good stream Jess.

1534
03:07:08,680 --> 03:07:10,159
I feel like awful right now.

1535
03:07:10,159 --> 03:07:12,280
I feel awful.

1536
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:14,399
Okay, let's go back to it.

1537
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:21,200
Taking pictures of money animals.

1538
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:23,760
I know a lot of you here are waiting for Pac-Man

1539
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:27,360
and I'm going to stall for a very long time.

1540
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:36,090
Be aware of that.

1541
03:07:36,090 --> 03:07:38,809
What else was there?

1542
03:07:38,809 --> 03:07:43,680
In the tall grass, okay.

1543
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:45,520
I think I heard a Pokemon crying around here,

1544
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:47,120
but where is it coming from?

1545
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:50,239
Okay, somewhere in with all of the flowers.

1546
03:07:50,239 --> 03:07:51,079
In the day, right?

1547
03:07:51,079 --> 03:07:54,229
Yeah.

1548
03:07:54,229 --> 03:07:55,909
Upload the Snackies picture.

1549
03:07:55,909 --> 03:08:10,639
I will.

1550
03:08:10,639 --> 03:08:12,280
Apology song or it's over.

1551
03:08:13,200 --> 03:08:24,479
What's over?

1552
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:30,489
Apology song.

1553
03:08:30,489 --> 03:08:31,649
I'm sorry.

1554
03:08:31,649 --> 03:08:34,680
I'm sorry.

1555
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:38,690
At your bottom dollar that I'm sorry.

1556
03:08:38,690 --> 03:08:39,530
Will be.

1557
03:08:44,209 --> 03:08:47,129
The sun will come out tomorrow.

1558
03:08:47,129 --> 03:08:54,600
At your bottom dollar that tomorrow.

1559
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:56,559
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

1560
03:08:56,559 --> 03:08:57,399
Smile at me.

1561
03:08:57,399 --> 03:08:58,239
Tomorrow.

1562
03:08:59,079 --> 03:09:07,430
You're only a day away.

1563
03:09:07,430 --> 03:09:08,270
That wasn't even a,

1564
03:09:08,270 --> 03:09:09,469
that wasn't a modern apology song.

1565
03:09:09,469 --> 03:09:14,120
I just sang you a song from Annie.

1566
03:09:14,120 --> 03:09:16,040
No, no, don't do it.

1567
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:16,879
Don't do it.

1568
03:09:16,879 --> 03:09:19,270
Oh my God, I'm going to do it.

1569
03:09:19,270 --> 03:09:20,110
Ew.

1570
03:09:20,110 --> 03:09:21,120
Ew.

1571
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:21,959
Ew.

1572
03:09:21,959 --> 03:09:23,920
Ew.

1573
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:24,760
No.

1574
03:09:24,760 --> 03:09:25,600
Ew.

1575
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:26,440
Don't do it.

1576
03:09:26,440 --> 03:09:27,280
I don't know.

1577
03:09:27,280 --> 03:09:36,500
Just go back to what I was doing.

1578
03:09:36,500 --> 03:09:45,069
I went that tall grass.

1579
03:09:45,069 --> 03:09:47,959
There was kind of a lightsaber in that room.

1580
03:09:47,959 --> 03:09:49,840
Yeah, I do got a lightsaber in this room.

1581
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:53,040
You want to fuck with me?

1582
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:54,319
Huh?

1583
03:09:54,319 --> 03:09:55,520
Oh, what's that?

1584
03:09:55,520 --> 03:10:05,719
Oh, excuse me.

1585
03:10:05,719 --> 03:10:06,559
Oh, what's that?

1586
03:10:06,559 --> 03:10:09,559
He's got a lightsaber in his room, don't he?

1587
03:10:09,559 --> 03:10:20,399
Don't fuck with me.

1588
03:10:20,399 --> 03:10:22,319
I'm supposed to, I gotta take a picture of something.

1589
03:10:22,319 --> 03:10:36,000
Holy shit, I look like I fucking live under the bridge.

1590
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,280
Put this down.

1591
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:41,799
Get that fucking saber out of here.

1592
03:10:41,799 --> 03:10:49,440
All right, where's that tall grass?

1593
03:10:49,440 --> 03:10:57,520
There's something crying, it said.

1594
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:59,600
All right, here's the tall grass.

1595
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:02,649
There's something crying over here.

1596
03:11:02,690 --> 03:11:07,159
Anybody hear anything crying?

1597
03:11:07,159 --> 03:11:09,959
Ah, it's you.

1598
03:11:09,959 --> 03:11:10,799
No, it's not.

1599
03:11:10,799 --> 03:11:13,760
Who's crying?

1600
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:18,290
Tall grass, something crying right here.

1601
03:11:18,290 --> 03:11:24,079
Who's crying?

1602
03:11:24,079 --> 03:11:26,020
You?

1603
03:11:26,020 --> 03:11:28,770
Are you crying?

1604
03:11:28,770 --> 03:11:34,110
I don't think that bird is crying.

1605
03:11:34,110 --> 03:11:44,790
Who's crying?

1606
03:11:44,790 --> 03:11:46,469
No, please, why, why, why?

1607
03:11:46,469 --> 03:11:47,950
What happened?

1608
03:11:47,950 --> 03:11:49,750
Whoa, I can throw that?

1609
03:11:49,750 --> 03:12:03,920
I didn't know I could do that.

1610
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:06,920
I got it.

1611
03:12:06,920 --> 03:12:07,760
I heard.

1612
03:12:17,709 --> 03:12:29,139
What was crying?

1613
03:12:29,139 --> 03:12:32,219
Somebody said, you look like Dumb and Dumber together.

1614
03:12:32,219 --> 03:12:42,280
Like fused together.

1615
03:12:42,280 --> 03:13:14,590
Like Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey.

1616
03:13:14,590 --> 03:13:22,319
You look like a weatherman.

1617
03:13:22,319 --> 03:13:23,760
Okay, I gotta stop it.

1618
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:27,520
Hey, I know there are plenty of,

1619
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:35,760
there are plenty of very handsome weathermen.

1620
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:41,610
I like that one, it's cute.

1621
03:13:41,610 --> 03:13:46,430
You look like a Dutch Renaissance artist.

1622
03:13:46,430 --> 03:13:48,700
Roll out the mustache.

1623
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:53,879
You know, I only, I only have this

1624
03:13:53,879 --> 03:13:55,360
because I wanted to turn the webcam on

1625
03:13:55,360 --> 03:13:57,319
and scare everybody.

1626
03:13:57,319 --> 03:14:11,319
Everybody likes it, but keep it?

1627
03:14:11,319 --> 03:14:12,440
Keep it.

1628
03:14:13,280 --> 03:14:14,120
I hate it.

1629
03:14:14,120 --> 03:14:14,959
I don't like it.

1630
03:14:14,959 --> 03:14:15,920
Keep it, yes.

1631
03:14:15,920 --> 03:14:19,409
Go a whole month doing it.

1632
03:14:19,409 --> 03:14:32,579
You went from looking 25 to 65.

1633
03:14:32,579 --> 03:14:38,120
Keep it, keep it.

1634
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:40,159
All right, well, I apparently messed up.

1635
03:14:48,020 --> 03:14:53,920
It's a disgustingly handsome mustache.

1636
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:56,190
Okay, so let me,

1637
03:14:56,190 --> 03:15:02,229
I just repeated what she just said, but still.

1638
03:15:02,229 --> 03:15:04,069
Stick thieves caught on cam.

1639
03:15:04,069 --> 03:15:11,850
Shit, the meta is changing very quickly,

1640
03:15:11,850 --> 03:15:13,930
hourly, on an hourly basis.

1641
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:16,530
It was snacks.

1642
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:18,969
Now it's LOL.

1643
03:15:18,969 --> 03:15:22,149
Look what my ring camera picked up.

1644
03:15:22,149 --> 03:15:23,469
I'm falling behind.

1645
03:15:23,469 --> 03:15:24,989
I'm falling behind.

1646
03:15:24,989 --> 03:15:26,190
I need to be on top of this shit.

1647
03:15:26,190 --> 03:15:28,469
I need to make a new trend.

1648
03:15:30,540 --> 03:15:42,920
This one's cool too, this one's awesome.

1649
03:15:42,920 --> 03:15:52,030
I'm running off of old meta.

1650
03:15:52,030 --> 03:16:03,500
Okay, photo decks.

1651
03:16:03,500 --> 03:16:04,420
No, where is it?

1652
03:16:04,420 --> 03:16:14,659
It's my folder, right?

1653
03:16:14,659 --> 03:16:16,940
I'm literally about to bite somebody.

1654
03:16:16,940 --> 03:16:18,700
Settle down, sit down.

1655
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:25,030
What's wrong with you?

1656
03:16:25,030 --> 03:16:31,690
Album, okay.

1657
03:16:31,690 --> 03:16:32,850
Maybe you can view photos you've saved

1658
03:16:32,850 --> 03:16:33,690
after your research trips,

1659
03:16:33,690 --> 03:16:36,190
including edited photos and re-snaps.

1660
03:16:36,190 --> 03:16:38,500
All right, there's Snackies.

1661
03:16:38,500 --> 03:16:40,420
Snackies.

1662
03:16:40,420 --> 03:16:42,360
And now I upload this.

1663
03:16:42,360 --> 03:16:43,200
All right, does this like,

1664
03:16:43,200 --> 03:16:45,780
this doesn't like,

1665
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:47,860
what do you see like my fucking like,

1666
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:48,700
I don't know.

1667
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:55,190
I don't even see my account name.

1668
03:16:55,190 --> 03:16:59,590
Read the precautions from the internet.

1669
03:16:59,590 --> 03:17:00,430
What are you talking about?

1670
03:17:00,430 --> 03:17:06,549
Read the internet precautions.

What's going on?

1676
03:17:23,809 --> 03:17:25,819
All right, I wanna,

1677
03:17:25,819 --> 03:17:27,620
yeah, I'm really glad I didn't show this

1678
03:17:27,620 --> 03:17:29,059
because it shows like my fucking,

1679
03:17:29,059 --> 03:17:30,739
like my friend code up here.

1680
03:17:30,739 --> 03:17:40,159
I don't want people to have that.

1681
03:17:40,159 --> 03:17:50,579
There, Snackies.

1682
03:17:50,579 --> 03:17:51,659
Okay, I did it.

1683
03:17:51,659 --> 03:17:52,899
I got it.

1684
03:17:52,899 --> 03:18:00,819
It's there.

1685
03:18:00,819 --> 03:18:04,930
He doesn't want us as friends.

1686
03:18:04,930 --> 03:18:08,389
No, I don't.

1687
03:18:08,389 --> 03:18:10,590
I don't.

1688
03:18:10,590 --> 03:18:14,950
I don't want to be incessantly spammed

1689
03:18:14,950 --> 03:18:16,790
with 5,000 friend requests

1690
03:18:16,790 --> 03:18:20,760
every time I turn on my fucking Nintendo Switch.

1691
03:18:20,760 --> 03:18:22,200
I'm sorry, but that's the fact.

1692
03:18:22,200 --> 03:18:31,709
That's the truth.

1693
03:18:31,709 --> 03:18:34,719
Mustache changed you.

1694
03:18:34,719 --> 03:18:41,569
What the fuck do you know about anything?

1695
03:18:41,569 --> 03:18:52,889
Excuse me.

1696
03:18:52,889 --> 03:18:58,879
Uh-oh, here comes the evil arc.

1697
03:18:58,879 --> 03:19:01,940
You know what happens when somebody has a mustache.

1698
03:19:01,940 --> 03:19:06,159
Turn fucking evil.

1699
03:19:06,159 --> 03:19:07,079
All right, in the tall grass,

1700
03:19:07,079 --> 03:19:13,120
I'm gonna get this one.

1701
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:15,399
The mask comes off, huh?

1702
03:19:15,399 --> 03:19:23,389
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

1703
03:19:23,389 --> 03:19:34,500
He was sus before and now he's evil.

1704
03:19:34,500 --> 03:19:36,940
Is it weird that I have these strange,

1705
03:19:36,940 --> 03:19:43,030
nightmarish type dreams being invited

1706
03:19:43,030 --> 03:19:45,309
to a Twitch panel of some kind?

1707
03:19:45,309 --> 03:19:51,719
Or an e-clown thing where I'm one of the panelists

1708
03:19:51,719 --> 03:19:55,120
and underneath my nameplate, it says Jerma985

1709
03:19:55,120 --> 03:19:57,520
and then there's a lower thirds graphics come up

1710
03:19:57,520 --> 03:20:01,420
that says the sus guy and it has like that face.

1711
03:20:01,420 --> 03:20:16,700
That's like why I got invited.

1712
03:20:16,700 --> 03:20:20,760
And I have to, I have a microphone in front of me

1713
03:20:20,760 --> 03:20:26,209
and five to 10 times during the Q&A section,

1714
03:20:26,209 --> 03:20:28,690
somebody comes up to like ask a question.

1715
03:20:28,690 --> 03:20:31,129
They go, this one's for Jerma.

1716
03:20:31,129 --> 03:20:33,399
I lean in, yeah, what's up, man?

1717
03:20:33,399 --> 03:20:39,079
Hey, what do you think about this like red trash can?

1718
03:20:39,079 --> 03:20:42,459
Don't you think it looks a little sus?

1719
03:20:42,459 --> 03:20:44,459
And then I like have to smile and go.

1720
03:20:46,950 --> 03:20:56,110
And everybody in the audience like claps and shit and laughs.

1721
03:20:56,110 --> 03:21:03,110
I don't want that to happen to me.

1722
03:21:03,950 --> 03:21:13,860
Grass is coming up.

1723
03:21:13,860 --> 03:21:19,600
That's too late, it's inevitable.

1724
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:22,450
Whoa, that was cool, do that again.

1725
03:21:22,450 --> 03:21:28,959
Hello, do that again.

1726
03:21:28,959 --> 03:21:39,680
How about do it again?

1727
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:42,920
What did I get wrong here?

1728
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:49,219
I'm over the two cannon, right?

1729
03:21:49,219 --> 03:22:02,610
All grass, I feel bad for Jerma in that regard.

1730
03:22:02,610 --> 03:22:10,579
Wait, shiny, all right, here we go again.

1731
03:22:10,579 --> 03:22:11,940
So there's something crying.

1732
03:22:11,940 --> 03:22:14,299
I need to like activate this thing

1733
03:22:14,299 --> 03:22:19,719
and find the thing that's crying.

1734
03:22:19,719 --> 03:22:22,809
It's like bullet drop with this shit, come on.

1735
03:22:22,850 --> 03:22:24,010
Somebody's crying here.

1736
03:22:29,309 --> 03:22:34,100
Who's crying?

1737
03:22:34,100 --> 03:22:42,319
I don't see anybody crying in the tree.

1738
03:22:42,319 --> 03:22:58,059
I don't, hello, somebody crying?

1739
03:22:58,059 --> 03:23:13,479
Nobody here, what the hell?

1740
03:23:13,479 --> 03:23:14,799
In the tall grass, yeah,

1741
03:23:14,799 --> 03:23:20,139
but isn't this where the photo was?

1742
03:23:20,139 --> 03:23:28,079
It's one of these peaky pecks, it has to be.

1743
03:23:28,079 --> 03:23:29,159
Well, I'm just gonna skip this one

1744
03:23:29,159 --> 03:23:39,040
because I don't get it.

1745
03:23:39,040 --> 03:24:00,379
We are all crying, crying, call us.

1746
03:24:00,379 --> 03:24:02,100
None of these are bad, I just, no.

1747
03:24:02,100 --> 03:24:06,000
I'm not showing any photos.

1748
03:24:06,959 --> 03:24:12,389
It's a kid's game, how do you not get it?

1749
03:24:12,389 --> 03:24:16,149
Yeah, and Tic-Tac-Toe is also a kid's game.

1750
03:24:16,149 --> 03:24:17,829
And you get your ass kicked in that one too,

1751
03:24:17,829 --> 03:24:33,700
don't you, all the time.

1752
03:24:33,700 --> 03:24:35,420
You gotta use the zoom function.

1753
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:39,670
No, don't, thank you, the one chatter.

1754
03:24:39,670 --> 03:24:41,819
Sudden movement, okay.

1755
03:24:41,819 --> 03:24:46,549
I saw tan growth suddenly move in the most amazing way.

1756
03:24:46,549 --> 03:24:47,750
I already have one of these pictures.

1757
03:24:47,750 --> 03:24:49,629
All right, we're going to take that photo.

1758
03:24:49,629 --> 03:25:09,020
Tan growth is a solution to never lose Tic-Tac-Toe.

1759
03:25:09,020 --> 03:25:10,379
Yeah, but then that makes you,

1760
03:25:10,379 --> 03:25:15,379
that makes you, oh, yeah, shush, shush, shush, shush.

1761
03:25:15,420 --> 03:25:17,579
That makes you an asshole.

1762
03:25:17,579 --> 03:25:18,420
No one wants to play Tic-Tac-Toe with you

1763
03:25:18,420 --> 03:25:25,420
if you're gonna do that.

1764
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:33,229
Those are cool.

1765
03:25:33,229 --> 03:25:35,500
Okay, there it is.

1766
03:25:35,500 --> 03:25:39,989
Now wake up and do the thing.

1767
03:25:39,989 --> 03:25:46,219
Did I miss it?

1768
03:25:46,219 --> 03:26:07,559
Jump, jump, jump, jump.

1769
03:26:07,559 --> 03:26:13,319
Did I get it?

1770
03:26:13,319 --> 03:26:15,329
I think I got it.

1771
03:26:15,329 --> 03:26:22,950
Oh, there was something else too.

1772
03:26:22,950 --> 03:26:27,340
That's a good one.

1773
03:26:27,340 --> 03:26:30,540
And that's new.

1774
03:26:30,540 --> 03:26:31,379
No, it's not.

1775
03:26:31,379 --> 03:26:36,139
All right, let's activate this.

1776
03:26:37,059 --> 03:26:46,479
Wake up.

1777
03:26:46,479 --> 03:26:47,319
You're losing viewers.

1778
03:26:47,319 --> 03:26:50,340
What are you gonna do to make people stay?

1779
03:26:50,340 --> 03:26:53,590
I don't know.

1780
03:26:53,590 --> 03:26:58,049
Nothing.

1781
03:26:58,049 --> 03:26:59,170
All right, there's somebody sleeping over here

1782
03:26:59,170 --> 03:27:08,760
that's not supposed to be sleeping over here, right?

1783
03:27:08,760 --> 03:27:10,440
Wait, there's the Dorito.

1784
03:27:10,440 --> 03:27:12,540
There's the Dorito bird.

1785
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:13,379
That was really cool.

1786
03:27:13,379 --> 03:27:14,659
I wish I took a picture of it.

1787
03:27:14,659 --> 03:27:17,299
Wait, what do I have to do with the Pidgeotto?

1788
03:27:17,299 --> 03:27:21,040
What do I do?

1789
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:22,079
Oh, feet, apples.

1790
03:27:22,079 --> 03:27:27,489
He likes to eat.

1791
03:27:27,489 --> 03:27:34,610
He's gonna warm up to me, right?

1792
03:27:34,610 --> 03:27:42,899
Look this way and be happy.

1793
03:27:42,899 --> 03:27:48,200
I sort of meow.

1794
03:27:48,200 --> 03:27:49,280
What was that?

1795
03:27:49,680 --> 03:28:01,610
The Magikarp's dying.

1796
03:28:01,610 --> 03:28:05,170
Looks like the Beedoof have finished building their dam.

1797
03:28:05,170 --> 03:28:11,409
Oh my God, that's so cute.

1798
03:28:11,409 --> 03:28:12,610
It's you.

1799
03:28:12,610 --> 03:28:13,809
You're the one that's not supposed to,

1800
03:28:13,809 --> 03:28:19,440
you're the cute one that's not sleeping, right?

1801
03:28:19,440 --> 03:28:36,450
Holy shit, that's a rare Pokemon.

1802
03:28:36,450 --> 03:28:45,159
Oh, this is where we get the bird foot.

1803
03:28:45,159 --> 03:28:46,750
Get it.

1804
03:28:46,750 --> 03:28:50,450
Why is my arm so weak?

1805
03:28:50,450 --> 03:28:51,329
Got it, right?

1806
03:28:51,329 --> 03:28:53,500
That's what I needed, right?

1807
03:28:53,500 --> 03:28:54,340
What's that thing?

1808
03:28:54,340 --> 03:28:57,799
What's that thing?

1809
03:28:57,799 --> 03:29:13,170
Oh, where do I go?

1810
03:29:13,170 --> 03:29:13,989
What was that?

1811
03:29:13,989 --> 03:29:15,690
Something's moving in the flowers.

1812
03:29:15,690 --> 03:29:21,389
Holy shit.

1813
03:29:21,389 --> 03:29:24,370
That's perfect shot.

1814
03:29:25,250 --> 03:29:32,879
These things are so dull.

1815
03:29:32,879 --> 03:29:33,760
They don't like do anything.

1816
03:29:33,760 --> 03:29:34,639
They don't move.

1817
03:29:34,639 --> 03:29:35,479
Like come here.

1818
03:29:35,479 --> 03:29:48,520
You guys are kind of dull.

1819
03:29:48,520 --> 03:29:50,559
They're just bees.

1820
03:29:50,559 --> 03:30:00,010
They're kind of a dull Pokemon.

1821
03:30:00,010 --> 03:30:01,090
Dull.

1822
03:30:01,090 --> 03:30:01,930
Oh, nice.

1823
03:30:01,930 --> 03:30:09,780
Okay, I got the Smash Brothers side bee.

1824
03:30:09,819 --> 03:30:10,860
Which one's the best?

1825
03:30:10,860 --> 03:30:15,459
Probably that one.

1826
03:30:15,459 --> 03:30:26,299
Two or yeah, that one.

1827
03:30:26,299 --> 03:30:27,139
I didn't get it.

1828
03:30:27,139 --> 03:30:28,719
I missed it somehow.

1829
03:30:28,719 --> 03:30:29,879
I don't know how I missed it.

1830
03:30:29,879 --> 03:30:30,719
Don't ask me.

1831
03:30:32,420 --> 03:30:34,139
This is so stupid.

1832
03:30:35,100 --> 03:30:42,680
I'm gonna do this one.

1833
03:30:42,680 --> 03:30:46,000
That looks like the battle bus.

1834
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:46,840
Battle.

1835
03:30:46,840 --> 03:30:48,040
Oh no, you said battle pass.

1836
03:30:48,040 --> 03:31:02,809
I was like, what's a battle bus?

1837
03:31:02,809 --> 03:31:06,280
All right, what's the one that I need?

1838
03:31:06,280 --> 03:31:08,079
That one?

1839
03:31:08,079 --> 03:31:15,170
I think it's this one, right?

1840
03:31:15,170 --> 03:31:18,700
You literally know what the battle bus is.

1841
03:31:18,700 --> 03:31:20,760
Ooh.

1842
03:31:20,760 --> 03:31:21,600
Which one?

1843
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:32,680
Probably that one.

1844
03:31:32,680 --> 03:31:35,360
Shit.

1845
03:31:35,360 --> 03:31:45,709
I kind of have to go with this one.

1846
03:31:45,709 --> 03:31:46,790
This is the foot one.

1847
03:31:55,729 --> 03:31:56,649
Do I have twos?

1848
03:31:56,690 --> 03:31:57,889
I have twos and I have a one.

1849
03:31:57,889 --> 03:31:59,889
All right, this is a three and a four.

1850
03:31:59,889 --> 03:32:01,290
This one, definitely.

1851
03:32:01,290 --> 03:32:07,479
Without a doubt.

1852
03:32:07,479 --> 03:32:09,889
I like this one better.

1853
03:32:09,889 --> 03:32:10,729
Who was sleeping?

1854
03:32:10,729 --> 03:32:11,569
Did I get the one?

1855
03:32:11,569 --> 03:32:12,569
All right.

1856
03:32:12,569 --> 03:32:15,840
This one's sleeping.

1857
03:32:15,840 --> 03:32:23,209
Let's go.

1858
03:32:23,209 --> 03:32:28,790
Oh, Pac-Man, he's crying.

1859
03:32:28,790 --> 03:32:32,770
Well, he can cry until I play the game.

1860
03:32:32,770 --> 03:32:35,159
It's coming up soon, I don't know.

1861
03:32:35,159 --> 03:32:38,840
That's all, I'm just hanging out.

1862
03:32:38,840 --> 03:32:45,680
Stop taking photos, you peeked at snackies.

1863
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:51,969
I don't think, yeah, I didn't get the thing.

1864
03:32:51,969 --> 03:32:56,059
Nice.

1865
03:32:56,059 --> 03:32:56,940
Nice work.

1866
03:32:56,940 --> 03:33:02,680
That's pretty good.

1867
03:33:03,639 --> 03:33:19,340
This is a bad picture, but I think it's what he wanted.

1868
03:33:19,340 --> 03:33:20,989
That's a good one.

1869
03:33:20,989 --> 03:33:22,920
This should be diamond, right?

1870
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:26,889
Yep.

1871
03:33:26,889 --> 03:33:29,930
Your photos are swag.

1872
03:33:29,930 --> 03:33:32,079
Thanks.

1873
03:33:32,079 --> 03:33:36,000
I'll get a Pokemon bonus for this.

1874
03:33:36,000 --> 03:33:36,840
What's with the placement?

1875
03:33:36,840 --> 03:33:46,319
Why was that so good?

1876
03:33:46,319 --> 03:33:48,930
This is a better picture though.

1877
03:33:48,930 --> 03:33:49,770
Whatever.

1878
03:33:54,479 --> 03:33:57,819
That's gonna be really good.

1879
03:33:57,819 --> 03:33:59,020
Placement is perfect.

1880
03:33:59,020 --> 03:33:59,940
That's diamond.

1881
03:33:59,940 --> 03:34:02,079
No.

1882
03:34:02,079 --> 03:34:09,479
Whatever.

1883
03:34:09,479 --> 03:34:11,250
Better than what I had.

1884
03:34:11,250 --> 03:34:12,559
What?

1885
03:34:12,600 --> 03:34:21,639
Well, I have to keep this one because he wants this one.

1886
03:34:21,639 --> 03:34:25,120
Why do I not have one single photo of this guy?

1887
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:30,040
For one star.

1888
03:34:30,040 --> 03:34:38,319
I feel like I take 30 pictures of that guy.

1889
03:34:38,319 --> 03:34:51,059
Oh shit.

1890
03:34:51,059 --> 03:34:52,020
I love this one on the right.

1891
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:53,139
The guy going, yes.

1892
03:35:06,159 --> 03:35:09,719
Why do you play baby games?

1893
03:35:09,719 --> 03:35:11,239
Because they're really easy

1894
03:35:11,239 --> 03:35:13,719
and I don't have to think too hard.

1895
03:35:13,719 --> 03:35:16,459
That's why.

1896
03:35:16,459 --> 03:35:17,899
Well, because it's really simple

1897
03:35:17,899 --> 03:35:20,469
and I don't have to think that much.

1898
03:35:20,469 --> 03:35:21,629
That's a professor's favorite.

1899
03:35:21,629 --> 03:35:22,469
What a great photo.

1900
03:35:22,469 --> 03:35:24,110
I'll go ahead and upload it as my new favorite.

1901
03:35:24,110 --> 03:35:26,850
What do you mean you gotta upload that?

1902
03:35:26,850 --> 03:35:27,889
No, that's my photo.

1903
03:35:27,889 --> 03:35:32,120
You're not gonna take it and upload it on your account?

1904
03:35:32,120 --> 03:35:34,879
I'm, that's, and you put like your signature on it.

1905
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:39,440
He stamped it as his.

1906
03:35:39,440 --> 03:35:40,680
All right, I've uploaded the photo.

1907
03:35:40,680 --> 03:35:42,079
Go to the internet and check your page.

1908
03:35:42,079 --> 03:35:42,920
What?

1909
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:53,850
I didn't want you to do that.

1910
03:35:53,850 --> 03:35:58,870
Reddit him.

1911
03:35:58,870 --> 03:36:00,750
He's gonna sell it as an NFT.

1912
03:36:07,299 --> 03:36:09,579
You got a total of one sweet medal.

1913
03:36:09,579 --> 03:36:11,170
Oh!

1914
03:36:11,170 --> 03:36:21,680
Somebody sweeted my picture.

1915
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:24,719
Combi are very devoted to Vespiquen.

1916
03:36:24,719 --> 03:36:25,719
If you observe them closely,

1917
03:36:25,719 --> 03:36:29,040
you see that these Pokemon do more than just gather nectar.

1918
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:40,370
It all happened here.

1919
03:36:40,370 --> 03:36:41,889
This is, I want this.

1920
03:36:41,889 --> 03:36:43,450
Why can't I, I want these filters.

1921
03:36:43,450 --> 03:36:44,850
I want this filter.

1922
03:36:47,469 --> 03:36:48,750
I want that.

1923
03:36:48,750 --> 03:36:50,389
How come I don't have those?

1924
03:36:50,389 --> 03:36:59,600
I would do so much better work.

1925
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,450
All right, I can go here at night.

1926
03:37:01,450 --> 03:37:03,819
That's a hit.

1927
03:37:03,819 --> 03:37:07,280
Wait, didn't I take this picture?

1928
03:37:07,280 --> 03:37:11,940
I took this photo.

1929
03:37:11,940 --> 03:37:18,479
I took that photo.

1930
03:37:18,479 --> 03:37:20,440
I heard a really loud noise and it got me wondering,

1931
03:37:20,440 --> 03:37:22,760
do you think Arbok ever falls out of its tree

1932
03:37:22,760 --> 03:37:23,600
while it's sleeping?

1933
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:24,840
I have to pay attention to that.

1934
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:29,739
All right, what was this one?

1935
03:37:29,739 --> 03:37:30,659
I already, I took this picture.

1936
03:37:30,659 --> 03:37:32,180
Didn't I get this?

1937
03:37:32,180 --> 03:37:36,420
I see Pic, I see Pikipek flying near Toucanon's nest.

1938
03:37:36,420 --> 03:37:37,540
What do you suppose they're up to?

1939
03:37:37,540 --> 03:37:40,639
I didn't I get, I already got a photo of this.

1940
03:37:40,639 --> 03:37:41,760
All right, we're looking for the big snake

1941
03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:45,450
falling out of the tree.

1942
03:37:45,450 --> 03:37:46,409
What time of day is that?

1943
03:37:46,409 --> 03:37:47,530
Day, it's daytime.

1944
03:37:47,530 --> 03:37:48,569
All right, we're looking for the snake

1945
03:37:48,569 --> 03:38:01,989
falling out of the tree.

1946
03:38:01,989 --> 03:38:05,229
Snake falling out of the tree.

1947
03:38:05,229 --> 03:38:09,639
I don't care about anybody else, just the snake.

1948
03:38:09,639 --> 03:38:17,430
Where is he?

1949
03:38:17,430 --> 03:38:22,110
Where is he?

1950
03:38:22,110 --> 03:38:22,989
All's out of the tree.

1951
03:38:22,989 --> 03:38:25,899
All right, that he's right there.

1952
03:38:25,899 --> 03:38:26,780
He didn't fall out of a tree.

1953
03:38:26,780 --> 03:38:32,870
He's literally right here.

1954
03:38:32,870 --> 03:38:46,530
That was a nighttime mission.

1955
03:38:46,530 --> 03:38:47,889
He's so baked.

1956
03:38:59,309 --> 03:39:00,270
I don't know, somebody,

1957
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:02,149
somebody pasted something and it was gone instantly.

1958
03:39:02,149 --> 03:39:11,799
I have no idea what you said.

1959
03:39:11,799 --> 03:39:22,409
It was probably a copy pasta.

1960
03:39:22,409 --> 03:39:24,370
Jungle at night, looking for the snake

1961
03:39:24,370 --> 03:39:31,399
falling out of the tree.

1962
03:39:31,399 --> 03:39:35,280
Go check Professor Mirror's hard drive.

1963
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:36,120
Why?

1964
03:39:50,520 --> 03:39:52,379
Apple?

1965
03:39:52,379 --> 03:39:54,139
All right, where is he?

1966
03:39:54,139 --> 03:39:56,319
Oh, there he is.

1967
03:39:56,319 --> 03:40:18,559
Does he fall out of the tree?

1968
03:40:18,600 --> 03:40:26,739
I don't think, he does not fall out of the tree.

1969
03:40:26,739 --> 03:40:46,100
Okay, come on, bun sweets.

1970
03:40:46,100 --> 03:40:47,420
I have painful stinging blisters

1971
03:40:47,420 --> 03:40:53,239
from walking four miles in flip-flops today.

1972
03:40:53,239 --> 03:40:54,079
What are you thinking?

1973
03:40:54,079 --> 03:40:58,670
What were you thinking?

1974
03:40:58,670 --> 03:41:01,110
You know the maximum amount of walking time

1975
03:41:01,110 --> 03:41:02,870
you should do with flip-flops

1976
03:41:02,870 --> 03:41:05,430
is either slipping them on and off

1977
03:41:05,430 --> 03:41:07,549
to go to where the sand is at the beach

1978
03:41:07,549 --> 03:41:11,840
and maybe walk up on the boardwalk somewhere for a little bit

1979
03:41:11,840 --> 03:41:13,479
or in the amount of time it takes

1980
03:41:13,479 --> 03:41:15,600
to go get your mail from the mailbox.

1981
03:41:15,600 --> 03:41:17,239
How would you do that for four hours?

1982
03:41:33,739 --> 03:41:34,819
I'm surprised, you know what?

1983
03:41:34,819 --> 03:41:40,079
Frankly, I'm surprised you're still alive.

1984
03:41:40,079 --> 03:41:48,209
Someone's sleeping down here, too.

1985
03:41:48,209 --> 03:41:50,129
What if it was a really long driveway?

1986
03:41:54,739 --> 03:41:56,340
All right, why is it missing something else here?

1987
03:41:56,340 --> 03:42:09,909
I got it, I got the snake.

1988
03:42:09,909 --> 03:42:12,110
Something's gonna come out of that ruined door.

1989
03:42:12,110 --> 03:42:15,920
Right, it has to be.

1990
03:42:15,920 --> 03:42:21,299
Something in there.

1991
03:42:21,299 --> 03:42:22,420
An electric eel is gonna come out

1992
03:42:22,420 --> 03:42:27,500
when I put something in there, right?

1993
03:42:27,500 --> 03:42:29,579
You know when an electric eel puts its head out

1994
03:42:29,579 --> 03:42:32,510
and has that weird like, bleh.

1995
03:42:32,510 --> 03:42:35,680
They always come out of holes like that.

1996
03:42:35,680 --> 03:42:42,430
Where is everybody?

1997
03:42:42,430 --> 03:42:47,069
Where's that sound?

1998
03:42:47,110 --> 03:42:54,799
I miss that every time.

1999
03:42:54,799 --> 03:43:13,639
Oh, that's that guy's photo.

2000
03:43:13,639 --> 03:43:15,989
Wait, what's this?

2001
03:43:15,989 --> 03:43:18,010
Who is that?

2002
03:43:18,010 --> 03:43:19,780
Somebody over there.

2003
03:43:19,780 --> 03:43:23,379
Who's acting?

2004
03:43:23,379 --> 03:43:26,120
Oh, it's a woofer.

2005
03:43:26,120 --> 03:43:30,840
You like apples?

2006
03:43:30,840 --> 03:43:36,479
No, he doesn't like me anymore.

2007
03:43:36,479 --> 03:43:37,319
He's pissed.

2008
03:43:44,229 --> 03:44:03,290
What are you still doing awake, woofer?

2009
03:44:03,290 --> 03:44:09,569
All right, I think I got the photo I needed here.

2010
03:44:09,569 --> 03:44:18,559
Family guy waiting room.

2011
03:44:18,559 --> 03:44:20,239
Stop zooming in.

2012
03:44:20,239 --> 03:44:25,590
I get the tool tip that says zoom in more frequently.

2013
03:44:25,590 --> 03:44:35,049
I'm doing what the game is telling me to do.

2014
03:44:35,049 --> 03:44:38,159
What Pokemon would taste the best?

2015
03:44:38,159 --> 03:44:40,889
I don't know, one of the birds?

2016
03:44:40,889 --> 03:44:53,579
Whatever the one is the closest resembling a chicken.

2017
03:44:53,579 --> 03:44:58,920
How do I get these guys to be two?

2018
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:04,440
I think we'll compare to that photo.

2019
03:45:04,440 --> 03:45:07,309
What the hell?

2020
03:45:07,309 --> 03:45:09,670
I mean, that's clearly what he was looking for.

2021
03:45:17,760 --> 03:45:26,799
This isn't better, no.

2022
03:45:26,799 --> 03:45:30,530
You have to knock him out of the tree.

2023
03:45:30,530 --> 03:45:34,520
I threw a few apples at him, it didn't do anything.

2024
03:45:34,520 --> 03:45:36,940
Ah, this is a woofer.

2025
03:45:36,940 --> 03:45:38,139
That's a good photo, but wait a minute.

2026
03:45:38,139 --> 03:45:40,399
Look at this one.

2027
03:45:40,399 --> 03:45:43,879
Oh, it's this one.

2028
03:45:43,879 --> 03:45:48,250
Throw more apples.

2029
03:45:48,250 --> 03:45:54,319
Ancient ruins.

2030
03:45:54,319 --> 03:45:56,120
Code on your profile is for this game,

2031
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:58,399
not your Switch friend code, you adult.

2032
03:45:58,399 --> 03:46:09,799
Oh, well.

2033
03:46:09,799 --> 03:46:13,020
I always wanted to eat a Pokemon, why?

2034
03:46:13,020 --> 03:46:30,770
Oh, I don't understand why.

2035
03:46:30,770 --> 03:46:36,819
I didn't see my message, I saw that one.

2036
03:46:36,819 --> 03:46:40,000
Let us see the profile so we can upvote everything.

2037
03:46:40,000 --> 03:46:42,520
No, I'm not gonna game the system

2038
03:46:42,520 --> 03:46:47,590
and have my stuff get upvoted.

2039
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:51,409
That's, you're probably gonna get my account banned.

2040
03:46:51,409 --> 03:46:53,729
You wanna like brigade my profile?

2041
03:46:53,729 --> 03:47:12,379
You're gonna get me thrown off of the Pokemon Snap forums.

2042
03:47:12,379 --> 03:47:15,940
How am I still level one here?

2043
03:47:15,940 --> 03:47:17,760
All right, there we go, present.

2044
03:47:17,760 --> 03:47:25,950
Snapped a total of 500 photos.

2045
03:47:25,950 --> 03:47:27,389
Am I insane or is he just replaying

2046
03:47:27,389 --> 03:47:28,709
two levels over and over?

2047
03:47:28,709 --> 03:47:32,020
I mean, that's what I have unlocked now.

2048
03:47:54,159 --> 03:47:56,840
Be too popular to play games publicly.

2049
03:47:57,969 --> 03:48:00,770
No, I'm not.

2050
03:48:00,770 --> 03:48:03,450
Okay, who needs wings?

2051
03:48:03,450 --> 03:48:07,110
I just heard Dodrio can fly, never seen one.

2052
03:48:07,149 --> 03:48:12,450
Okay, that's near the end where the owl is.

2053
03:48:13,409 --> 03:48:20,120
And then go find what motivates the combies to work.

2054
03:48:23,489 --> 03:48:25,049
That's all the requests I have for here?

2055
03:48:25,049 --> 03:48:29,250
Oh, what about complete?

2056
03:48:29,250 --> 03:48:38,620
I haven't even been completing quests.

2057
03:48:38,620 --> 03:48:44,979
Are you kidding me?

2058
03:48:44,979 --> 03:48:46,659
Design 13.

2059
03:48:46,659 --> 03:48:53,840
Oh, that's how you get, all right, I get it.

2060
03:48:53,840 --> 03:49:02,530
Completed, what else do I get?

2061
03:49:02,530 --> 03:49:03,850
Ooh, it's an effect.

2062
03:49:03,850 --> 03:49:07,969
Now I can start actually making cool things.

2063
03:49:08,930 --> 03:49:13,549
Complete, making a splash.

2064
03:49:13,549 --> 03:49:15,870
Oh, I forgot the wooden dog toy, that's right.

2065
03:49:15,870 --> 03:49:25,620
I'll go get it after, before I play Pac-Man.

2066
03:49:25,620 --> 03:49:28,239
All right, is this all I have during the night?

2067
03:49:28,239 --> 03:49:45,250
All right, we gotta take a picture of the Dodrio flying.

2068
03:49:45,250 --> 03:49:46,930
Remember, look at the joke tracker right now.

2069
03:49:46,930 --> 03:49:54,079
Market's closed.

2070
03:49:54,079 --> 03:50:01,239
Whoa, oh right, I gotta get him doing this.

2071
03:50:01,239 --> 03:50:06,610
Gotta get him jumping in the air.

2072
03:50:06,610 --> 03:50:11,409
He goes, whoa, and he jumps up.

2073
03:50:11,409 --> 03:50:15,649
Hey, what?

2074
03:50:15,649 --> 03:50:22,100
What the hell was that?

2075
03:50:22,100 --> 03:50:23,899
That was bizarre, that was weird.

2076
03:50:23,899 --> 03:50:29,090
Why did he do that?

2077
03:50:29,129 --> 03:50:35,520
Can he jump again?

2078
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:45,250
Jump, fine, whatever.

2079
03:50:45,250 --> 03:50:56,600
All right, I need the Dodrio flying right into the owl.

2080
03:50:56,680 --> 03:51:00,110
A lot of them, what was that?

2081
03:51:00,110 --> 03:51:01,590
That's like a weird planet or something.

2082
03:51:01,590 --> 03:51:02,430
What is that?

2083
03:51:02,430 --> 03:51:05,690
It's a person on a parachute.

2084
03:51:05,690 --> 03:51:10,430
That's somebody on a parachute.

2085
03:51:10,430 --> 03:51:11,549
What is that?

2086
03:51:11,549 --> 03:51:18,579
This pink thing, see that?

2087
03:51:18,579 --> 03:51:19,500
Did I miss him flying?

2088
03:51:19,500 --> 03:51:24,040
I think I did.

2089
03:51:24,040 --> 03:51:24,879
Does that count?

2090
03:51:24,879 --> 03:51:35,520
I think does that count as flying?

2091
03:51:35,520 --> 03:51:39,520
How did the stream reach negative 5,000?

2092
03:51:39,520 --> 03:51:47,500
Because people are just spamming it.

2093
03:51:53,030 --> 03:52:02,670
Let me eat these, let me eat these.

2094
03:52:02,670 --> 03:52:11,409
That was good, that was good too.

2095
03:52:11,409 --> 03:52:12,370
He's gonna fly right over here

2096
03:52:12,370 --> 03:52:16,870
and I'm gonna get it, one, two, three.

2097
03:52:25,829 --> 03:52:32,360
All right, Dodrio flying, here he comes.

2098
03:52:32,360 --> 03:52:33,639
What's the best Star Wars?

2099
03:52:36,170 --> 03:52:39,399
Empire Strikes Back.

2100
03:52:39,399 --> 03:52:45,840
I'm actually returning the Jedi guy.

2101
03:52:45,840 --> 03:52:47,079
My favorite of all the movies

2102
03:52:47,079 --> 03:52:49,680
because Mark Hamill looks like a stage hand

2103
03:52:49,680 --> 03:52:59,190
to the whole movie, my favorite.

2104
03:52:59,190 --> 03:53:04,850
When does he fly?

2105
03:53:04,850 --> 03:53:06,569
This is it, ready?

2106
03:53:06,850 --> 03:53:10,899
Shit, where is he?

2107
03:53:10,899 --> 03:53:25,559
There he is, I got it, right?

2108
03:53:25,559 --> 03:53:32,180
Light it up, something is motivating them.

2109
03:53:32,180 --> 03:53:35,870
What's motivating them?

2110
03:53:35,870 --> 03:53:50,760
You, you fly at the end?

2111
03:53:50,760 --> 03:54:00,959
I think I got it.

2112
03:54:00,959 --> 03:54:02,200
Jumping counts, good.

2113
03:54:02,200 --> 03:54:07,860
All right, I got it then.

2114
03:54:07,860 --> 03:54:12,559
I think I completed like three quests here.

2115
03:54:12,559 --> 03:54:17,290
Stupid, stupid.

2116
03:54:17,290 --> 03:54:19,409
I think this, I mean, it just looks weird.

2117
03:54:28,600 --> 03:54:33,250
I don't know, I guess this one's better.

2118
03:54:33,250 --> 03:54:38,270
Cell, cell, that's a good one here.

2119
03:54:38,270 --> 03:54:45,159
Okay, Dodrio flying.

2120
03:54:45,200 --> 03:54:51,399
This one is, it's probably this one.

2121
03:54:51,399 --> 03:54:58,200
Is he Yoto?

2122
03:54:58,200 --> 03:55:03,040
Which one did he, which one did he want?

2123
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:05,979
I think it's this one, right?

2124
03:55:05,979 --> 03:55:20,659
That one, it's this one.

2125
03:55:20,659 --> 03:55:25,000
Swanna, Sir?

2126
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:30,659
Okay, Kombi, sure, that one.

2127
03:55:30,659 --> 03:55:36,190
I guess I'll take that one.

2128
03:55:36,190 --> 03:55:37,629
Somebody said pick pictures every time,

2129
03:55:37,629 --> 03:55:39,760
even if you don't need them.

2130
03:55:39,760 --> 03:55:43,649
Because I'm losing out on experience.

2131
03:55:43,649 --> 03:55:50,079
Just as free EXP.

2132
03:55:50,079 --> 03:55:51,360
Do an ASMR of you telling us

2133
03:55:51,360 --> 03:55:53,760
comforting things like I'm proud of you, okay?

2134
03:55:55,590 --> 03:56:01,059
Ahem.

2135
03:56:01,059 --> 03:56:06,420
I am so goddamn proud of you.

2136
03:56:06,420 --> 03:56:08,149
Look what you've done.

2137
03:56:08,149 --> 03:56:12,250
Look what you've been able to accomplish.

2138
03:56:12,250 --> 03:56:14,020
Take a look outside.

2139
03:56:14,020 --> 03:56:16,040
See that sun up there?

2140
03:56:16,040 --> 03:56:18,319
It's shining down on you.

2141
03:56:18,319 --> 03:56:19,909
Go for it.

2142
03:56:19,909 --> 03:56:22,200
Do it.

2143
03:56:22,200 --> 03:56:26,379
You know you can.

2144
03:56:26,379 --> 03:56:28,870
Good luck.

2145
03:56:28,870 --> 03:56:29,950
I almost just leaned in and went.

2146
03:56:29,950 --> 03:56:34,319
That would have been really bad.

2147
03:56:34,319 --> 03:56:37,709
There you go, there you go.

2148
03:56:37,709 --> 03:56:40,559
Where's my money?

2149
03:56:40,559 --> 03:56:46,569
All right, Buffle Ant, that's a good Buffle Ant.

2150
03:56:46,569 --> 03:56:48,290
That was a sarcastic voice.

2151
03:56:50,989 --> 03:56:58,340
Wasn't?

2152
03:56:58,340 --> 03:56:59,180
There's the request.

2153
03:56:59,180 --> 03:57:01,620
Ooh, I've completed his page.

2154
03:57:01,620 --> 03:57:11,399
What's that mean?

2155
03:57:11,399 --> 03:57:14,870
3,500.

2156
03:57:14,870 --> 03:57:16,659
It's new.

2157
03:57:16,659 --> 03:57:19,649
Get it in there.

2158
03:57:19,649 --> 03:57:25,930
Okay, there's the flying Dodrio.

2159
03:57:25,930 --> 03:57:29,780
Dodrio's now complete.

2160
03:57:29,780 --> 03:57:38,319
Plus two JRM to the moon.

2161
03:57:38,319 --> 03:57:51,350
Better photo.

2162
03:57:51,350 --> 03:57:52,670
Why, what the fuck?

2163
03:57:52,670 --> 03:57:55,809
Why is that one so much better?

2164
03:57:55,809 --> 03:57:58,549
What?

2165
03:57:58,549 --> 03:58:10,629
Because I guess he's powering up.

2166
03:58:10,629 --> 03:58:13,110
Mom said it's my turn on the Xbox.

2167
03:58:13,110 --> 03:58:13,989
Go play it.

2168
03:58:13,989 --> 03:58:14,829
It's in the other room.

2169
03:58:14,829 --> 03:58:17,850
I'm on the Switch.

2170
03:58:17,850 --> 03:58:20,290
Can you not differentiate the two consoles?

2171
03:58:20,290 --> 03:58:26,469
I can't help you, little bro.

2172
03:58:26,469 --> 03:58:33,690
It's a better picture.

2173
03:58:33,690 --> 03:58:35,809
This chat is omega fucked right now.

2174
03:58:47,959 --> 03:58:56,510
Okay, now let me get my presents.

2175
03:58:56,510 --> 03:58:58,270
Hey, little bro.

2176
03:59:03,979 --> 03:59:04,819
A movement?

2177
03:59:04,819 --> 03:59:07,190
That's a really bad picture.

2178
03:59:07,190 --> 03:59:09,629
This is more Apple than it is guy jumping.

2179
03:59:10,920 --> 03:59:20,969
Ooh, hey, this one.

2180
03:59:20,969 --> 03:59:24,600
Awesome.

2181
03:59:24,600 --> 03:59:34,780
You got a profile icon, Rita.

2182
03:59:34,780 --> 03:59:36,579
I gotta go back here, right?

2183
03:59:39,409 --> 03:59:44,110
Okay, when, what was his name, Magnum?

2184
03:59:44,110 --> 03:59:46,030
When Magnum gets to the spot,

2185
03:59:46,030 --> 03:59:48,110
starts looking around restlessly.

2186
03:59:48,110 --> 03:59:59,010
Okay, that tree is looking for a friend.

2187
03:59:59,010 --> 03:59:59,850
That's cool.

2188
04:00:07,809 --> 04:00:09,090
Magnum.

2189
04:00:09,090 --> 04:00:14,090
Oh, I dropped my Magnum condom for my monster dong.

2190
04:00:21,909 --> 04:00:24,549
Or is it the other way around?

2191
04:00:24,549 --> 04:00:28,989
Oh, I dropped my monster condom for my Magnum dong.

2192
04:00:28,989 --> 04:00:29,829
It's that one.

2193
04:00:29,829 --> 04:00:38,690
I did it the wrong way.

2194
04:00:38,690 --> 04:00:45,840
Okay, I need to get this big dragon thing.

2195
04:00:45,840 --> 04:00:57,760
I said, I did it the wrong?

2196
04:00:57,760 --> 04:01:00,559
What's that?

2197
04:01:00,559 --> 04:01:02,559
Oh my God, it's an Eevee.

2198
04:01:04,959 --> 04:01:05,799
Whoa.

2199
04:01:16,690 --> 04:01:17,530
Oh.

2200
04:01:40,389 --> 04:01:42,430
I can't believe I just got a picture of an Eevee.

2201
04:01:42,430 --> 04:01:46,479
It's, it's, it's.

2202
04:01:46,479 --> 04:01:48,190
Everyone's.

2203
04:01:48,190 --> 04:01:50,469
Oh my God, I can't believe I got a picture of Eevee.

2204
04:01:50,469 --> 04:01:52,030
That's my- Everyone's.

2205
04:01:52,030 --> 04:02:03,979
Favorite Pokemon.

2206
04:02:03,979 --> 04:02:05,500
Okay, so hold on now.

2207
04:02:05,500 --> 04:02:16,239
When he gets to this tree, he's looking for a friend.

2208
04:02:16,920 --> 04:02:24,149
Did it do anything else?

2209
04:02:24,149 --> 04:02:26,840
Eevee is God tier.

2210
04:02:26,840 --> 04:02:32,100
Always have an Eevee in your party.

2211
04:02:32,100 --> 04:02:39,590
Eevee is, Eevee is air type, water type, ground type,

2212
04:02:39,590 --> 04:02:52,399
and has two earth attacks.

2213
04:02:52,399 --> 04:02:59,600
Okay, so where's the friend?

2214
04:02:59,600 --> 04:03:01,889
Here comes a friend.

2215
04:03:01,889 --> 04:03:09,840
We're looking for the friend.

2216
04:03:09,840 --> 04:03:14,200
Okay, where's the friend?

2217
04:03:14,200 --> 04:03:15,040
You see a friend?

2218
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:18,479
He's waiting for a friend right here.

2219
04:03:18,479 --> 04:03:20,040
He's looking for a friend right here,

2220
04:03:20,040 --> 04:03:28,319
in front of this tree, behind you.

2221
04:03:28,319 --> 04:03:30,200
No, no, no, no.

2222
04:03:30,200 --> 04:03:35,290
They came from behind.

2223
04:03:35,290 --> 04:03:37,750
All right, let's go attack.

2224
04:03:37,750 --> 04:03:39,909
Oh, there go all of my helicopters.

2225
04:03:39,909 --> 04:03:42,750
They came from, they came from,

2226
04:03:42,750 --> 04:03:51,620
they came, they came from, they came from behind.

2227
04:03:51,620 --> 04:03:55,120
I think it was Eevee, I got it.

2228
04:03:55,120 --> 04:03:59,850
They came from, they came from, from behind, behind.

2229
04:03:59,850 --> 04:04:11,440
They came from-

2230
04:04:11,440 --> 04:04:16,030
Remember, your high is fucked today.

2231
04:04:16,030 --> 04:04:17,510
Go, go complain about it.

2232
04:04:17,510 --> 04:04:19,799
Go complain about it then.

2233
04:04:19,799 --> 04:04:25,120
Go complain about it.

2234
04:04:25,200 --> 04:04:26,040
Sorry, I'm sorry.

2235
04:04:26,040 --> 04:04:28,040
That was the mustache talking.

2236
04:04:28,040 --> 04:04:34,479
That's the mustache is taking it out, is making me do that.

2237
04:04:34,479 --> 04:04:35,600
It's probably just be, which one?

2238
04:04:35,600 --> 04:04:36,440
This one?

2239
04:04:49,159 --> 04:04:50,319
I don't know which one is the best one.

2240
04:04:50,319 --> 04:04:59,440
Probably the jumping one.

2241
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:04,760
Probably this one.

2242
04:05:04,760 --> 04:05:06,680
I can't replace that one.

2243
04:05:06,680 --> 04:05:12,030
That one's too good.

2244
04:05:12,030 --> 04:05:14,420
Oh, wait, okay, here we go.

2245
04:05:14,420 --> 04:05:15,659
Ooh, perfect, that one's better.

2246
04:05:15,659 --> 04:05:18,639
This one's good.

2247
04:05:18,639 --> 04:05:28,559
This one right here.

2248
04:05:28,559 --> 04:05:36,059
Why is your shot composition so shitty?

2249
04:05:36,059 --> 04:05:40,340
I didn't know I was in film school.

2250
04:05:40,340 --> 04:05:48,649
Nice work.

2251
04:05:48,649 --> 04:05:50,170
This is good EXP.

2252
04:05:50,170 --> 04:05:53,250
It's 5,400.

2253
04:05:53,250 --> 04:05:58,559
Sustache.

2254
04:05:58,559 --> 04:06:03,280
Funny, Jeremy used to be a wedding photographer.

2255
04:06:03,280 --> 04:06:05,520
Um, I'm sorry.

2256
04:06:05,520 --> 04:06:07,559
I think there's something a little different

2257
04:06:07,559 --> 04:06:11,040
with holding a camera and filming people

2258
04:06:11,040 --> 04:06:15,340
than holding two Joy-Con switch controllers

2259
04:06:15,340 --> 04:06:17,860
that don't, you don't have any manual zoom.

2260
04:06:17,860 --> 04:06:19,020
I don't have an ISO.

2261
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:21,129
I don't have an f-stop.

2262
04:06:21,129 --> 04:06:25,209
And taking pictures of like cartoon animals

2263
04:06:25,209 --> 04:06:28,670
that jump out behind trees and shit.

2264
04:06:28,670 --> 04:06:29,950
This is a little different.

2265
04:06:29,950 --> 04:06:35,469
I guarantee you, if you gave this game to Martin Scorsese,

2266
04:06:35,469 --> 04:06:37,430
he would take like four of these like shitty pictures

2267
04:06:37,430 --> 04:06:38,469
and be like, what the fuck is this?

2268
04:06:38,469 --> 04:06:39,309
What is this game?

2269
04:06:39,309 --> 04:06:40,510
This is cute.

2270
04:06:40,510 --> 04:06:42,430
I'm gonna go on to make million dollar pictures.

2271
04:06:42,430 --> 04:06:46,209
I get to enjoy it.

2272
04:06:46,209 --> 04:06:59,280
Now, you think he'd care?

2273
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:02,209
Somebody just said, just say it's too hard.

2274
04:07:02,209 --> 04:07:06,350
It's too hard.

2275
04:07:06,350 --> 04:07:10,969
I didn't get anything.

2276
04:07:10,969 --> 04:07:19,459
How is that not the friend?

2277
04:07:19,459 --> 04:07:26,920
I don't understand.

2278
04:07:26,920 --> 04:07:30,569
Do I not get it?

2279
04:07:30,569 --> 04:07:33,079
Yeah.

2280
04:07:33,079 --> 04:07:34,959
When Magnum gets to the spot,

2281
04:07:34,959 --> 04:07:36,639
it starts looking around kind of restlessly.

2282
04:07:36,639 --> 04:07:39,770
Do you think it's looking for one of its friends?

2283
04:07:39,770 --> 04:07:56,069
Isn't Eevee just running around?

2284
04:07:56,069 --> 04:07:57,030
Otto's wood toy.

2285
04:07:57,030 --> 04:07:59,309
I know, I'm gonna get it before I play Pac-Man.

2286
04:07:59,309 --> 04:08:00,590
I'm gonna get it.

2287
04:08:00,590 --> 04:08:05,069
You'll see it, don't worry.

2288
04:08:05,069 --> 04:08:14,520
Good luck.

2289
04:08:14,520 --> 04:08:22,239
Let's go.

2290
04:08:22,239 --> 04:08:25,819
Okay, now wait till he gets here.

2291
04:08:25,819 --> 04:08:33,559
Does the Plato dinosaur like apples?

2292
04:08:36,270 --> 04:08:44,620
No, not really.

2293
04:08:44,620 --> 04:08:47,110
Let's fucking go.

2294
04:08:47,110 --> 04:08:48,829
Viewers are gonna drop if you switch to Pac-Man.

2295
04:08:48,829 --> 04:08:50,069
Remember that.

2296
04:08:50,069 --> 04:09:00,079
Whatever.

2297
04:09:00,079 --> 04:09:03,829
Whoa, look, look.

2298
04:09:03,829 --> 04:09:04,870
I got them.

2299
04:09:04,870 --> 04:09:12,639
That's what he was looking for.

2300
04:09:12,639 --> 04:09:16,159
Dude, I am getting way too excited over

2301
04:09:16,159 --> 04:09:19,370
the back of a cereal box.

2302
04:09:19,370 --> 04:09:20,209
You know what I mean?

2303
04:09:20,209 --> 04:09:21,530
I'm getting way too excited about this.

2304
04:09:21,530 --> 04:09:28,350
I turned 36 this year.

2305
04:09:28,350 --> 04:09:30,260
He's looking.

2306
04:09:30,260 --> 04:09:37,139
What's he looking for?

2307
04:09:37,139 --> 04:09:41,360
It's all eyes on him.

2308
04:09:41,360 --> 04:09:42,639
As long as you're having fun, it's all right.

2309
04:09:42,639 --> 04:09:51,750
Yeah, I know.

2310
04:09:51,750 --> 04:09:53,629
That's too excited.

2311
04:09:53,629 --> 04:09:54,829
Okay, here we go.

2312
04:09:54,829 --> 04:09:59,680
Where is this friend that's apparently over here?

2313
04:09:59,719 --> 04:10:00,559
Is he gonna get here?

2314
04:10:00,559 --> 04:10:03,969
Is he gonna look around?

2315
04:10:03,969 --> 04:10:08,290
I don't see anybody.

2316
04:10:08,290 --> 04:10:15,090
There's nobody here.

2317
04:10:15,090 --> 04:10:40,520
There's nobody here.

2318
04:10:40,520 --> 04:10:41,360
You missed it?

2319
04:10:41,360 --> 04:10:42,440
It's this tree right here.

2320
04:10:42,440 --> 04:10:43,440
It's this one.

2321
04:10:43,440 --> 04:10:44,440
There's nothing here.

2322
04:10:53,899 --> 04:10:56,200
How do I like my steak cooked?

2323
04:10:56,200 --> 04:10:57,639
I like my steak cooked.

2324
04:10:57,639 --> 04:11:01,659
However, the chef wants to prepare it.

2325
04:11:01,659 --> 04:11:04,829
Unless, of course, that's medium rare.

2326
04:11:04,829 --> 04:11:06,270
I listen for it.

2327
04:11:06,270 --> 04:11:08,350
I usually say, oh, however the chef likes it.

2328
04:11:08,350 --> 04:11:09,389
And they go, oh, medium rare?

2329
04:11:09,389 --> 04:11:10,590
And I go, no, no, thank you.

2330
04:11:10,590 --> 04:11:27,959
Medium, please, medium well.

2331
04:11:27,959 --> 04:11:29,959
I'm gonna tell you guys something.

2332
04:11:29,959 --> 04:11:33,030
A lot of you don't wanna hear this.

2333
04:11:33,030 --> 04:11:35,389
Yeah, you guys talk like, okay, boomer,

2334
04:11:35,389 --> 04:11:37,469
like you're a boomer, boomer shit.

2335
04:11:37,469 --> 04:11:42,219
Caring about how cooked your steak is

2336
04:11:42,219 --> 04:11:49,120
is such a boomer thing to care about.

2337
04:11:49,120 --> 04:11:54,870
That's quite a boomer thing to care about.

2338
04:11:54,870 --> 04:11:58,040
Whoa, why is this four?

2339
04:11:58,040 --> 04:12:05,649
I'm gonna use this one.

2340
04:12:05,649 --> 04:12:06,729
I like that.

2341
04:12:08,129 --> 04:12:10,010
Which one, one or two?

2342
04:12:10,010 --> 04:12:11,729
One or two.

2343
04:12:11,729 --> 04:12:12,569
Probably two.

2344
04:12:17,479 --> 04:12:19,799
Caring that somebody likes their steak medium

2345
04:12:20,639 --> 04:12:21,989
versus medium rare.

2346
04:12:21,989 --> 04:12:25,670
I could see like a big fat boomer guy at a grill

2347
04:12:25,670 --> 04:12:29,309
scoffing at the fact that I said that.

2348
04:12:29,309 --> 04:12:32,350
Hey, how do you want your burger?

2349
04:12:32,350 --> 04:12:33,190
Medium, please.

2350
04:12:33,190 --> 04:12:36,129
Okay, you fucking young millennial.

2351
04:12:36,129 --> 04:12:38,530
Oh, I love medium, medium well.

2352
04:12:38,530 --> 04:12:41,670
Sure thing, you want avocado on it too?

2353
04:12:41,670 --> 04:12:49,290
That's a boomer thing to care about.

2354
04:12:49,290 --> 04:13:00,739
That's cute, I like that one.

2355
04:13:00,739 --> 04:13:02,459
The boomers were right.

2356
04:13:08,809 --> 04:13:13,760
I have two of the same picture.

2357
04:13:14,319 --> 04:13:19,370
Different versions of that emo.

2358
04:13:19,370 --> 04:13:31,649
Am I gonna have them all be this?

2359
04:13:31,649 --> 04:13:46,190
This one's better, there's more friends.

2360
04:13:46,190 --> 04:13:47,430
You mean judging someone?

2361
04:13:47,430 --> 04:13:49,670
No, judging somebody on their,

2362
04:13:49,670 --> 04:13:52,200
how they eat their hamburger

2363
04:13:52,200 --> 04:14:06,010
on the temperature of the meat.

2364
04:14:06,010 --> 04:14:13,610
And I don't want to get any foodborne illnesses.

2365
04:14:13,610 --> 04:14:17,430
You know what happens if you don't cook fucking red meat

2366
04:14:17,430 --> 04:14:19,450
all the way through?

2367
04:14:19,450 --> 04:14:21,049
You like your bloody steak,

2368
04:14:21,049 --> 04:14:22,569
you like your bloody hamburger

2369
04:14:22,569 --> 04:14:27,549
with fucking red blood coming out of it?

2370
04:14:27,549 --> 04:14:51,170
Be careful, you're a weakling.

2371
04:14:51,170 --> 04:14:54,920
Myoglobulin, not blood.

2372
04:14:54,920 --> 04:15:09,440
Okay, look, I can make up a Pokemon name for stuff too.

2373
04:15:09,440 --> 04:15:12,239
Mods, please help, Grandpa's shouting at me again.

2374
04:15:13,200 --> 04:15:14,840
I have to get this one, this is one of,

2375
04:15:14,840 --> 04:15:22,579
I have to get a new zone, what's happening?

2376
04:15:22,579 --> 04:15:23,899
I need to get to level two, okay,

2377
04:15:23,899 --> 04:15:28,000
I'll get to level two right here.

2378
04:15:28,000 --> 04:15:34,370
Level two night, let's go.

2379
04:15:34,370 --> 04:15:37,010
Caring about steak is Joe Rogan shit.

2380
04:15:48,350 --> 04:15:49,629
I don't even know what you mean by that,

2381
04:15:49,629 --> 04:15:50,790
but I don't know, somehow I do.

2382
04:15:50,790 --> 04:15:52,549
I don't know what that even means,

2383
04:15:52,549 --> 04:15:54,829
but I kind of knew it, I know what it means.

2384
04:15:54,829 --> 04:15:55,989
It's weird, right?

2385
04:15:55,989 --> 04:16:05,329
I don't really even know what that means.

2386
04:16:05,329 --> 04:16:11,540
You've had elk meat, no, I have not.

2387
04:16:11,540 --> 04:16:24,360
I've not had venison, I've not had elk.

2388
04:16:24,360 --> 04:16:27,440
I keep, I don't want to take any pictures of the spider.

2389
04:16:27,440 --> 04:16:29,959
What was that?

2390
04:16:29,959 --> 04:16:31,600
All right, get a bunch of good photos.

2391
04:16:31,600 --> 04:16:37,000
I just need to level up.

2392
04:16:37,000 --> 04:17:09,360
How do you want your Fortnite burger?

2393
04:17:09,360 --> 04:17:11,159
Are you a juicy or dry kind of guy?

2394
04:17:12,989 --> 04:17:18,559
I'd say probably more in the juicy department.

2395
04:17:18,559 --> 04:17:19,959
I don't like it wet though,

2396
04:17:19,959 --> 04:17:21,600
because then it ruins the bun.

2397
04:17:21,600 --> 04:17:24,079
Everybody that wants like a bloody hamburger,

2398
04:17:24,079 --> 04:17:25,239
it ruins the bun.

2399
04:17:25,239 --> 04:17:29,520
The bun gets seeped in with this pink liquid

2400
04:17:29,520 --> 04:17:50,469
that turns it, it's soppy and gross.

2401
04:17:50,469 --> 04:17:51,309
I really mean this,

2402
04:17:51,309 --> 04:17:54,670
and I might gross somebody out here, but whatever.

2403
04:17:54,670 --> 04:17:59,100
I would prefer if you were to,

2404
04:17:59,100 --> 04:18:01,379
let me just get a photo here.

2405
04:18:01,379 --> 04:18:06,139
I would prefer it if you were to burn my hamburger.

2406
04:18:06,139 --> 04:18:09,770
I mean, like unrecognizable.

2407
04:18:09,770 --> 04:18:12,569
It's like char, it's not even meat anymore,

2408
04:18:12,569 --> 04:18:14,850
than eat a rare hamburger.

2409
04:18:14,850 --> 04:18:19,030
I would rather you leave it on to a point where like,

2410
04:18:19,030 --> 04:18:22,110
you could, like we're talking about burn,

2411
04:18:22,110 --> 04:18:24,909
like light it on fire and let it sit there.

2412
04:18:24,909 --> 04:18:28,750
I'm talking about like the skin on the marshmallow

2413
04:18:28,750 --> 04:18:30,549
when you let it just go in there

2414
04:18:30,549 --> 04:18:32,829
and let this just sit in the campfire.

2415
04:18:32,829 --> 04:18:34,149
And that's what I'm talking about.

2416
04:18:34,190 --> 04:18:44,059
I'd rather eat that than a rare steak.

2417
04:18:44,059 --> 04:18:45,260
I have not taken any pictures.

2418
04:18:45,260 --> 04:18:54,059
I'm supposed to take photos.

2419
04:18:54,059 --> 04:18:55,100
Burger, yes, steak, no.

2420
04:18:55,100 --> 04:18:59,309
Nope, both.

2421
04:18:59,309 --> 04:19:00,670
If you brought a rare steak to me,

2422
04:19:00,670 --> 04:19:04,690
I don't care how nice of a restaurant it is.

2423
04:19:04,690 --> 04:19:08,049
This could be like a $300 plate.

2424
04:19:08,049 --> 04:19:10,489
The finest cut of meat, rare.

2425
04:19:10,489 --> 04:19:14,489
I would order something from the kids menu.

2426
04:19:14,489 --> 04:19:16,549
I'd be like, can I just get like the fucking hot dog,

2427
04:19:16,549 --> 04:19:19,170
the mac and cheese and corn?

2428
04:19:19,170 --> 04:19:21,700
I don't want that.

2429
04:19:21,700 --> 04:19:37,059
I would not eat a rare steak.

2430
04:19:37,059 --> 04:19:41,979
I just don't like it.

2431
04:19:41,979 --> 04:19:46,979
I will eat sushi sometimes on very rare occasions,

2432
04:19:50,149 --> 04:19:54,950
but there's something about that raw red meat.

2433
04:19:54,950 --> 04:19:59,250
I cannot do it.

2434
04:19:59,250 --> 04:20:02,329
Unbased as fuck, my dude, just for your information.

2435
04:20:10,799 --> 04:20:13,610
Heresites are a myth.

2436
04:20:13,610 --> 04:20:22,959
What?

2437
04:20:22,959 --> 04:20:24,239
Would you ever go vegetarian?

2438
04:20:24,239 --> 04:20:32,100
No, I like the taste of chicken too much.

2439
04:20:35,979 --> 04:20:39,719
I love a good steak and cheese sandwich.

2440
04:20:39,719 --> 04:20:41,340
I could never give it up.

2441
04:20:41,340 --> 04:20:42,540
Not in a hundred million years.

2442
04:20:42,540 --> 04:20:44,620
I couldn't, I just couldn't do it.

2443
04:20:44,620 --> 04:20:48,059
Now, they're getting close.

2444
04:20:48,059 --> 04:20:49,299
They're getting close.

2445
04:20:49,299 --> 04:20:52,420
Like the Beyond meat stuff, the Impossible Burger stuff,

2446
04:20:52,420 --> 04:20:54,819
I think Beyond tastes a little better.

2447
04:20:54,819 --> 04:20:56,440
I think Beyond's a better product,

2448
04:20:56,440 --> 04:21:00,340
if I have to be honest with you.

2449
04:21:00,340 --> 04:21:02,899
They might get there soon.

2450
04:21:02,899 --> 04:21:08,100
Like I'm gonna give it probably like 10 years.

2451
04:21:08,100 --> 04:21:10,750
10 more years, I think they're gonna get it.

2452
04:21:10,790 --> 04:21:12,709
They'll figure out the chemical composition

2453
04:21:12,709 --> 04:21:14,309
to make it so you're eating meat,

2454
04:21:14,309 --> 04:21:15,829
but you're not even eating it.

2455
04:21:15,829 --> 04:21:16,670
They'll get it.

2456
04:21:16,670 --> 04:21:31,899
Maybe like 10, maybe 20.

2457
04:21:31,899 --> 04:21:34,879
This one is probably the best.

2458
04:21:34,879 --> 04:21:44,920
I'm just looking for experience.

2459
04:21:44,920 --> 04:21:48,860
I did not just say that I think that Beyond burgers

2460
04:21:48,860 --> 04:21:50,100
are better than real meat.

2461
04:21:50,100 --> 04:21:51,360
I didn't say that.

2462
04:21:51,360 --> 04:21:52,479
I said they're getting close

2463
04:21:52,479 --> 04:21:54,200
and they might be there in 10 to 20 years,

2464
04:21:54,200 --> 04:22:07,620
which they probably will be.

2465
04:22:07,620 --> 04:22:12,090
I mean that experience.

2466
04:22:12,090 --> 04:22:15,500
Did you say that Beyond was better than Impossible?

2467
04:22:15,500 --> 04:22:24,930
Yes.

2468
04:22:24,930 --> 04:22:27,489
And do you know that I'm not making this up?

2469
04:22:27,489 --> 04:22:30,420
You know that I'm telling you the truth

2470
04:22:30,420 --> 04:22:33,360
because I lost a shitload of money

2471
04:22:33,360 --> 04:22:35,879
buying puts on Beyond Meat,

2472
04:22:35,879 --> 04:22:37,959
like four and a half years ago

2473
04:22:37,959 --> 04:22:40,899
when they went into like IPO.

2474
04:22:40,899 --> 04:22:47,610
You know that I'm not bullshitting you here.

2475
04:22:47,610 --> 04:22:48,809
We all know that story.

2476
04:22:48,809 --> 04:23:01,139
So like I think it's a better product than Impossible.

2477
04:23:01,139 --> 04:23:02,299
Buying puts, Omega Low.

2478
04:23:02,299 --> 04:23:04,180
This was like four years ago.

2479
04:23:04,180 --> 04:23:12,129
This wasn't like last weekend.

2480
04:23:12,129 --> 04:23:13,510
I just didn't think that Beyond Meat

2481
04:23:13,510 --> 04:23:16,930
should have the valuation of like all the airlines

2482
04:23:16,930 --> 04:23:18,930
and every car company in America.

2483
04:23:18,930 --> 04:23:19,770
I'm sorry.

2484
04:23:19,770 --> 04:23:20,610
I just, it was crazy.

2485
04:23:20,610 --> 04:23:29,420
It was insane.

2486
04:23:29,420 --> 04:23:31,059
He shorted Beyond Meat, Omega.

2487
04:23:31,059 --> 04:23:31,899
Yeah, I did.

2488
04:23:31,899 --> 04:23:33,459
I, I, you know that.

2489
04:23:33,459 --> 04:23:39,120
I've been very transparent about that.

2490
04:23:39,120 --> 04:23:40,520
Back when it first came out,

2491
04:23:40,520 --> 04:23:43,639
it went up to like almost $300 a share.

2492
04:23:43,639 --> 04:23:56,020
And I was like, this is, what the hell is this?

2493
04:23:56,020 --> 04:23:57,719
And I got burned real bad.

2494
04:23:57,719 --> 04:24:00,959
And I, you know what they say?

2495
04:24:00,959 --> 04:24:08,510
You may have learned your lesson.

2496
04:24:08,510 --> 04:24:09,950
Remember you're wasting our sub money.

2497
04:24:09,950 --> 04:24:12,860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

2498
04:24:12,860 --> 04:24:15,909
That was actually YouTube money.

2499
04:24:15,909 --> 04:24:19,590
That was before I made anything on Twitch.

2500
04:24:19,590 --> 04:24:21,790
That was back in like 2015, 2016.

2501
04:24:21,790 --> 04:24:22,629
That wasn't Twitch money.

2502
04:24:22,629 --> 04:24:28,190
That was YouTube money.

2503
04:24:28,190 --> 04:24:36,959
Wasn't your, that wasn't what you guys, come on.

2504
04:24:36,959 --> 04:24:39,639
Six years ago.

2505
04:24:39,639 --> 04:24:43,260
Whatever it was, I don't know.

2506
04:24:43,260 --> 04:24:53,040
Yeah.

2507
04:24:56,459 --> 04:24:58,819
It also was not very much.

2508
04:24:58,819 --> 04:25:02,239
A lot of you guys are somehow assuming that I put like,

2509
04:25:03,120 --> 04:25:08,120
like $500 million on like a short on Beyond Meat.

2510
04:25:08,879 --> 04:25:11,479
No, that's, I wasn't, it was not even,

2511
04:25:11,479 --> 04:25:22,899
it was not, I was not very much money at all.

2512
04:25:22,899 --> 04:25:23,979
How do you like your eggs?

2513
04:25:23,979 --> 04:25:26,399
I like them over medium.

2514
04:25:26,399 --> 04:25:27,239
Not over easy.

2515
04:25:27,239 --> 04:25:28,120
They get all over the plate

2516
04:25:28,120 --> 04:25:30,399
and it ruins everything else that's on the plate.

2517
04:25:30,399 --> 04:25:34,340
If you have bacon, toast, ash browns, eggs,

2518
04:25:34,340 --> 04:25:37,559
and they're over easy, it just gets everywhere.

2519
04:25:37,559 --> 04:25:38,840
And then it gets all over your bacon,

2520
04:25:38,840 --> 04:25:41,020
all over your toast, all over your potatoes.

2521
04:25:41,020 --> 04:25:45,450
I want it to be separated.

2522
04:25:45,450 --> 04:25:47,430
I like a jammy yolk.

2523
04:25:47,430 --> 04:25:49,809
Doesn't get everywhere and it's good.

2524
04:25:49,809 --> 04:25:50,649
It's absolutely false.

2525
04:25:50,649 --> 04:25:51,729
No, it's not.

2526
04:25:51,729 --> 04:25:58,840
All right, I want, let me just beat this.

2527
04:25:58,840 --> 04:26:16,780
Over medium.

2528
04:26:16,780 --> 04:26:19,540
I want good pictures.

2529
04:26:19,540 --> 04:26:22,450
You don't even eat.

2530
04:26:22,450 --> 04:26:23,329
That's the whole point.

2531
04:26:23,329 --> 04:26:24,329
Yeah, maybe for you,

2532
04:26:24,329 --> 04:26:27,959
I like to have all my stuff separated.

2533
04:26:27,959 --> 04:26:31,579
There's one, I will make one exception.

2534
04:26:31,579 --> 04:26:33,620
What's that?

2535
04:26:33,620 --> 04:26:35,079
Is that a spider?

2536
04:26:35,079 --> 04:26:39,229
Ooh, that is a spider.

2537
04:26:39,229 --> 04:26:46,549
The only exception I make is corned beef hash.

2538
04:26:46,549 --> 04:26:50,170
So if you have corned beef hash

2539
04:26:50,170 --> 04:26:52,170
and you drop an over easy egg on top of it,

2540
04:26:52,170 --> 04:26:56,239
you let it sit on top and you break the yolk,

2541
04:26:56,239 --> 04:26:57,379
it gets really kind of,

2542
04:26:57,379 --> 04:27:01,260
you have to lay the egg right on top of the corned beef hash.

2543
04:27:01,260 --> 04:27:04,579
That's the only exception where I'll have an over easy egg.

2544
04:27:04,579 --> 04:27:07,500
And then it gets in there, but that's the point.

2545
04:27:07,500 --> 04:27:08,979
That was done intentionally.

2546
04:27:08,979 --> 04:27:12,239
It was done intentionally.

2547
04:27:12,239 --> 04:27:13,819
Having just regular over easy eggs,

2548
04:27:13,819 --> 04:27:15,420
unintentionally you get your shit everywhere.

2549
04:27:15,420 --> 04:27:20,930
I don't like that.

2550
04:27:21,690 --> 04:27:22,850
I need somebody to do something else.

2551
04:27:22,850 --> 04:27:24,739
I need an animal to do something.

2552
04:27:24,739 --> 04:27:26,040
These things are cute, I guess,

2553
04:27:26,040 --> 04:27:40,309
but I need you to do something cool.

2554
04:27:40,309 --> 04:27:49,180
Eat, eat that.

2555
04:27:49,180 --> 04:27:53,209
Good one, that's a good pick.

2556
04:27:53,209 --> 04:27:54,329
What's your favorite rom-com?

2557
04:27:54,329 --> 04:28:12,469
Is it you've got mail?

2558
04:28:12,469 --> 04:28:17,069
Got it.

2559
04:28:17,069 --> 04:28:19,690
You can do a little dance if you take pictures of me.

2560
04:28:19,690 --> 04:28:27,170
Okay.

2561
04:28:27,170 --> 04:28:29,889
I keep fucking missing those toucans.

2562
04:28:29,889 --> 04:28:31,809
I know, I was waiting for it to go.

2563
04:28:31,809 --> 04:28:41,280
I'm gonna restart.

2564
04:28:41,280 --> 04:28:42,280
You like Among Us?

2565
04:28:42,280 --> 04:28:52,370
No, no, I don't.

2566
04:28:52,370 --> 04:28:54,610
You know why I don't like Among Us?

2567
04:28:54,610 --> 04:28:56,209
Because I can't give you an opinion

2568
04:28:56,209 --> 04:28:58,250
if I do or don't like it.

2569
04:28:58,250 --> 04:29:02,239
I can't tell you because I've never played it.

2570
04:29:02,239 --> 04:29:03,479
Wait for the jump.

2571
04:29:03,479 --> 04:29:25,170
Got it.

2572
04:29:25,170 --> 04:29:25,989
Next game, please.

2573
04:29:25,989 --> 04:29:27,329
You've been playing the same level.

2574
04:29:27,329 --> 04:29:28,569
Yeah, that's Pokemon Snap.

2575
04:29:28,569 --> 04:29:30,889
I'm playing Pac-Man and like, I don't know.

2576
04:29:41,840 --> 04:29:48,180
I wanna take a picture of the woofer.

2577
04:29:48,180 --> 04:29:50,899
Eat that woofer, come on.

2578
04:29:50,899 --> 04:29:51,739
Eat it, please.

2579
04:29:51,739 --> 04:30:03,989
No, he's gonna be mad at me.

2580
04:30:03,989 --> 04:30:05,309
Pokemon Snap in real life.

2581
04:30:05,309 --> 04:30:17,030
I wanna do a bird watching stream if that counts.

2582
04:30:17,030 --> 04:30:19,700
That's a pretty cute photo.

2583
04:30:20,579 --> 04:30:21,420
I'm like eating the apple.

2584
04:30:21,420 --> 04:30:31,139
The apple's in his mouth.

2585
04:30:31,139 --> 04:30:34,020
And I wanted to have binoculars that had cameras in them.

2586
04:30:34,020 --> 04:30:36,420
So you could see what I see when I hold binoculars up.

2587
04:30:36,420 --> 04:30:49,459
It's like two, it's two cameras.

2588
04:30:49,459 --> 04:31:07,159
Go to a petting zoo.

2589
04:31:07,159 --> 04:31:08,000
What was it?

2590
04:31:10,010 --> 04:31:10,850
You're sweet.

2591
04:31:10,850 --> 04:31:12,290
Hope you have a good bird watching stream.

2592
04:31:12,290 --> 04:31:14,420
Oh, thank you.

2593
04:31:14,420 --> 04:31:15,940
That's a really nice of you to say.

2594
04:31:15,940 --> 04:31:25,040
Thank you.

2595
04:31:25,040 --> 04:31:26,680
All right, I got a three here.

2596
04:31:26,680 --> 04:31:28,479
Which is the best one in the, probably that one?

2597
04:31:28,479 --> 04:31:31,340
No, I mean, this is a horrible picture,

2598
04:31:31,340 --> 04:31:42,649
but it's definitely gonna be this one.

2599
04:31:45,420 --> 04:31:46,819
This is also a three.

2600
04:31:46,819 --> 04:31:48,780
The one I took originally is so much better,

2601
04:31:48,780 --> 04:31:50,260
but we'll do that one.

2602
04:31:52,909 --> 04:31:54,940
I have a new woofer.

2603
04:31:54,940 --> 04:31:57,219
I do, really?

2604
04:31:57,219 --> 04:32:00,579
Hmm.

2605
04:32:00,579 --> 04:32:09,469
Okay, that one's good.

2606
04:32:09,469 --> 04:32:18,280
All right, this should bring me to another level.

2607
04:32:18,280 --> 04:32:20,120
I urge people to dress up in bird costumes

2608
04:32:20,120 --> 04:32:22,200
and climb up the trees and act like they're real.

2609
04:32:22,200 --> 04:32:28,659
Nice work.

2610
04:32:28,659 --> 04:32:31,569
I mean, that's really funny.

2611
04:32:31,569 --> 04:32:35,899
But I would be putting somebody's life in danger

2612
04:32:35,940 --> 04:32:37,899
by having them have to go up in a really tall,

2613
04:32:37,899 --> 04:32:41,260
like 150 foot tall tree.

2614
04:32:41,260 --> 04:32:43,459
The thought is funny,

2615
04:32:43,459 --> 04:32:45,780
but I don't think anyone's gonna do that.

2616
04:32:45,780 --> 04:32:51,729
Nice work.

2617
04:32:51,729 --> 04:33:00,370
All right, did I finally level up?

2618
04:33:00,370 --> 04:33:10,110
Finally.

2619
04:33:10,110 --> 04:33:11,069
Yeah, this is definitely a level up.

2620
04:33:11,069 --> 04:33:21,729
It has to be.

2621
04:33:21,729 --> 04:33:26,240
That's a new one.

2622
04:33:26,240 --> 04:33:31,409
This is worse than Pokemon Go?

2623
04:33:31,409 --> 04:33:32,849
Well, I mean, the whole point of,

2624
04:33:34,250 --> 04:33:36,369
you don't battle, oh, I love snackies.

2625
04:33:42,419 --> 04:33:45,889
Level two, come on.

2626
04:33:45,889 --> 04:33:46,729
There we go.

2627
04:33:46,729 --> 04:33:47,889
All right, level two.

2628
04:33:49,150 --> 04:33:54,389
Open up a new zone.

2629
04:33:54,389 --> 04:33:56,509
By the way, thanks to the progress you made,

2630
04:33:56,509 --> 04:33:58,700
I've got something to report.

2631
04:33:58,700 --> 04:34:10,639
Here we are.

2632
04:34:10,639 --> 04:34:12,599
This game is good, if not greater than Pokemon Go.

2633
04:34:12,599 --> 04:34:20,180
People have been waiting, hold on.

2634
04:34:20,180 --> 04:34:22,279
Ha ha.

2635
04:34:22,279 --> 04:34:23,119
I can do it too.

2636
04:34:34,810 --> 04:34:43,189
Yeah, we got new islands.

2637
04:34:43,189 --> 04:34:45,270
One on this long, narrow island

2638
04:34:45,270 --> 04:34:49,659
and another offshore in the middle of the water.

2639
04:34:49,659 --> 04:34:52,459
What happened?

2640
04:34:52,459 --> 04:34:54,819
Never got to that spot offshore, did he?

2641
04:34:54,819 --> 04:34:56,869
This is gonna be amazing.

2642
04:34:56,869 --> 04:34:58,709
I'll let you decide what order you want to visit them in,

2643
04:34:58,709 --> 04:35:03,790
keep up the good work.

2644
04:35:03,790 --> 04:35:08,279
Why are you such a food snob, but you drink Huel, Omega Lo?

2645
04:35:08,279 --> 04:35:12,250
I'm not ordering Huel at a restaurant.

2646
04:35:12,250 --> 04:35:18,279
It would be very bizarre, now wouldn't it?

2647
04:35:18,279 --> 04:35:21,560
Free-dwelling Pokemon.

2648
04:35:21,560 --> 04:35:22,759
When that huge tree lit up,

2649
04:35:22,759 --> 04:35:24,319
I saw a bunch of Pokemon fly out of it,

2650
04:35:24,319 --> 04:35:31,950
but I couldn't tell what kind of Pokemon they were.

2651
04:35:31,950 --> 04:35:32,950
I took that one too.

2652
04:35:35,700 --> 04:35:36,860
Did I take this one?

2653
04:35:36,860 --> 04:35:40,299
No, that's not even mine.

2654
04:35:40,299 --> 04:35:44,689
All right, new zone.

2655
04:35:44,689 --> 04:35:45,529
How's it going?

2656
04:35:45,529 --> 04:35:47,610
Enjoying your research jaunts?

2657
04:35:47,610 --> 04:35:48,569
Listen, I've got to tell you something.

2658
04:35:48,569 --> 04:35:49,889
There's a feature I originally forgot

2659
04:35:49,889 --> 04:35:51,939
to suggest to the professor.

2660
04:35:51,979 --> 04:35:56,490
But I got him to add it to your research camera.

2661
04:35:56,490 --> 04:35:58,889
It's a melody player.

2662
04:35:58,889 --> 04:36:03,020
It lets your camera play a little tune.

2663
04:36:03,020 --> 04:36:06,939
A little magical tune can prompt Pokemon

2664
04:36:06,939 --> 04:36:10,250
to show you whole new sides of themselves.

2665
04:36:10,250 --> 04:36:11,490
Sounds awesome.

2666
04:36:11,490 --> 04:36:14,419
Could you fill in the details?

2667
04:36:14,419 --> 04:36:15,500
Sure thing.

2668
04:36:15,500 --> 04:36:19,380
If you press R, a melody will play.

2669
04:36:19,380 --> 04:36:21,139
Medium well Huel.

2670
04:36:21,139 --> 04:36:23,240
I left it in the sun for an hour.

2671
04:36:23,240 --> 04:36:26,060
While it's playing, you can press R again to make it stop.

2672
04:36:26,060 --> 04:36:27,939
A little music could wake up sleeping Pokemon.

2673
04:36:27,939 --> 04:36:29,779
Ooh, the Peter Griffin character.

2674
04:36:29,779 --> 04:36:31,060
I want to go use it on.

2675
04:36:31,060 --> 04:36:33,220
Or make some Pokemon get up and dance.

2676
04:36:33,220 --> 04:36:34,340
I haven't had a chance to try it though,

2677
04:36:34,340 --> 04:36:36,659
so I'm no expert yet.

2678
04:36:36,659 --> 04:36:43,720
Next, let's give it a whirl.

2679
04:36:43,720 --> 04:36:45,119
The game just opened wide up.

2680
04:36:51,000 --> 04:36:52,439
First, let me go use this on Peter Griffin.

2681
04:36:52,439 --> 04:36:54,150
Where was he?

2682
04:36:54,150 --> 04:36:55,150
Where was Peter Griffin?

2683
04:36:55,150 --> 04:36:58,599
Jungle?

2684
04:36:58,599 --> 04:37:00,560
Where was Peter Griffin here?

2685
04:37:00,560 --> 04:37:17,590
What was the jungle during the day?

2686
04:37:17,590 --> 04:37:29,750
See if we can get him to dance.

2687
04:37:29,750 --> 04:37:38,860
Oh, play the tune.

2688
04:37:38,860 --> 04:37:49,880
Dance, I want to dance.

2689
04:37:49,880 --> 04:37:57,360
This better work on Peter Griffin.

2690
04:37:57,360 --> 04:38:03,930
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

2691
04:38:03,930 --> 04:38:07,389
He hates it.

2692
04:38:07,389 --> 04:38:08,790
Okay.

2693
04:38:08,790 --> 04:38:16,090
All right, Peter, get up.

2694
04:38:16,090 --> 04:38:20,139
Really?

2695
04:38:20,139 --> 04:38:23,139
What?

2696
04:38:23,139 --> 04:38:30,279
That's stupid, why does he not get up?

2697
04:38:30,279 --> 04:38:37,220
I hear Bugleberry.

2698
04:38:37,220 --> 04:38:52,720
He's scared of the snake.

2699
04:38:52,720 --> 04:39:04,090
Ooh, you gonna dance?

2700
04:39:04,090 --> 04:39:18,310
I think this is a prank.

2701
04:39:18,310 --> 04:39:23,479
He's dancing?

2702
04:39:23,479 --> 04:39:25,560
He just looked like Stuart Griffin.

2703
04:39:25,560 --> 04:39:26,479
He just did.

2704
04:39:26,479 --> 04:39:33,610
It looks like it's Stuart Griffin in a costume.

2705
04:39:33,610 --> 04:39:38,299
It sounds like an ice cream truck, it kind of does.

2706
04:39:38,340 --> 04:39:39,779
Wooden dog toy now.

2707
04:39:39,779 --> 04:39:46,810
Just wait until I go to Pac-Man.

2708
04:39:46,810 --> 04:39:47,650
Did I get it?

2709
04:39:47,650 --> 04:39:54,970
That was cool.

2710
04:39:54,970 --> 04:39:56,209
Oh, hold on.

2711
04:39:56,209 --> 04:40:06,740
I need to do this.

2712
04:40:06,740 --> 04:40:11,209
Come on, I have to get it.

2713
04:40:11,209 --> 04:40:12,580
Did I get him?

2714
04:40:12,580 --> 04:40:15,419
I got it.

2715
04:40:15,419 --> 04:40:19,790
Hold on, does he come back?

2716
04:40:19,790 --> 04:40:27,990
Did I get it?

2717
04:40:27,990 --> 04:40:28,830
Oh, what's he got?

2718
04:40:28,830 --> 04:40:29,979
He's got something.

2719
04:40:29,979 --> 04:40:34,959
That little guy had something, what was that?

2720
04:40:34,959 --> 04:40:54,689
He had like a little sack.

2721
04:40:54,689 --> 04:41:04,580
I don't think this does anything.

2722
04:41:04,580 --> 04:41:14,220
Oh brother, this guy stinks.

2723
04:41:14,220 --> 04:41:19,990
Wait, look at them walking together.

2724
04:41:20,029 --> 04:41:22,380
Did I get him jumping?

2725
04:41:22,380 --> 04:41:23,220
That was cool.

2726
04:41:23,220 --> 04:41:32,770
Okay, he's gonna do his jump now.

2727
04:41:32,770 --> 04:41:50,029
Oh, snackies.

2728
04:41:50,029 --> 04:41:59,020
Okay, I think I got it.

2729
04:41:59,020 --> 04:42:00,380
I wanna go to the new area

2730
04:42:00,380 --> 04:42:03,209
and then I'll play Pac-Man, I promise.

2731
04:42:03,209 --> 04:42:05,209
I wanna see the new two new areas

2732
04:42:05,209 --> 04:42:09,919
and then I'm gonna play, get a few photos of each area.

2733
04:42:09,919 --> 04:42:12,740
Then I'm going to go,

2734
04:42:12,740 --> 04:42:15,619
go get the wooden toy to smell it in front of you.

2735
04:42:15,619 --> 04:42:27,020
Then I'm gonna play Pac-Man 99.

2736
04:42:27,020 --> 04:42:27,939
This is awful.

2737
04:42:27,939 --> 04:42:33,290
I hated every second of it.

2738
04:42:33,290 --> 04:42:35,770
Oh, that's new when he's rolling around, okay.

2739
04:42:35,770 --> 04:42:37,580
What's the best one?

2740
04:42:38,459 --> 04:42:45,090
It's the only one you can see.

2741
04:42:45,090 --> 04:42:45,930
I like the angry one.

2742
04:42:45,930 --> 04:43:00,060
God damn it, I want Peter Griffin to turn around so bad.

2743
04:43:00,060 --> 04:43:02,860
This one's cute.

2744
04:43:02,860 --> 04:43:03,700
Yeah, look at that.

2745
04:43:03,700 --> 04:43:04,540
That's so cute.

2746
04:43:07,299 --> 04:43:13,200
I like that one.

2747
04:43:13,200 --> 04:43:18,540
I like that one.

2748
04:43:18,540 --> 04:43:28,729
I like, I like this one over here.

2749
04:43:28,729 --> 04:43:30,819
Oh, these are awful.

2750
04:43:30,819 --> 04:43:45,069
This one.

2751
04:43:45,069 --> 04:43:49,330
And that one.

2752
04:43:49,330 --> 04:43:53,209
And that one.

2753
04:43:53,209 --> 04:43:57,060
Analyze it, please.

2754
04:43:57,060 --> 04:44:00,569
I'm gonna do a three hour BRB.

2755
04:44:00,569 --> 04:44:14,360
How would I go BRB for three hours, I'm sorry about that.

2756
04:44:16,509 --> 04:44:24,549
I'm sorry, I didn't mean when I said you stink.

2757
04:44:24,549 --> 04:44:29,299
Hold, diamond.

2758
04:44:29,299 --> 04:44:34,380
Do a coloring stream?

2759
04:44:34,380 --> 04:44:35,619
Like a coloring book.

2760
04:44:35,619 --> 04:44:37,209
I already did that.

2761
04:44:37,209 --> 04:44:38,209
Didn't everybody hate that?

2762
04:44:38,209 --> 04:44:39,569
I did like a coloring book stream

2763
04:44:39,569 --> 04:44:41,450
and everybody hated it, did I?

2764
04:44:41,450 --> 04:44:43,049
No, that was, no, no, no, no, I didn't.

2765
04:44:43,049 --> 04:44:44,529
I did like the,

2766
04:44:44,529 --> 04:44:49,599
no, everybody loved the highlights stream.

2767
04:44:49,599 --> 04:44:52,360
I didn't do a coloring book, I did like an activity book.

2768
04:44:52,360 --> 04:45:02,580
Everybody loved that stream, that was a lot of fun.

2769
04:45:02,580 --> 04:45:04,459
Now that was the card game stream.

2770
04:45:04,459 --> 04:45:07,470
That's the worst stream I've ever done.

2771
04:45:07,470 --> 04:45:11,110
The unlocked stream is the worst stream I've ever done.

2772
04:45:11,110 --> 04:45:18,840
I would argue that you could not convince me otherwise.

2773
04:45:18,840 --> 04:45:20,680
You couldn't even read the text.

2774
04:45:20,680 --> 04:45:23,319
My webcam is so bad.

2775
04:45:23,319 --> 04:45:25,159
And it was just not even interesting at all.

2776
04:45:25,159 --> 04:45:28,979
It was very painfully uninteresting.

2777
04:45:28,979 --> 04:45:31,060
Karazhan stream, at least the Karazhan stream was funny

2778
04:45:31,060 --> 04:45:36,099
because I was getting shit on for like 12 hours.

2779
04:45:36,099 --> 04:45:41,099
The unlock card stream was not funny.

2780
04:45:41,779 --> 04:45:43,950
It was awful.

2781
04:45:43,950 --> 04:45:45,229
No, the wow stream was not worse

2782
04:45:45,229 --> 04:45:49,619
than the unlock card game stream.

2783
04:45:49,619 --> 04:45:50,659
After force was the worst.

2784
04:45:50,659 --> 04:45:51,500
No, it was not.

2785
04:45:51,500 --> 04:45:52,459
I had a lot of fun on that stream.

2786
04:45:52,459 --> 04:45:53,979
I love that game.

2787
04:45:53,979 --> 04:46:00,759
I disagree.

2788
04:46:00,759 --> 04:46:11,569
All right, new zone.

2789
04:46:11,569 --> 04:46:16,139
I get to level three, almost.

2790
04:46:16,139 --> 04:46:24,400
All right, I want to see the new zone.

2791
04:46:24,400 --> 04:46:29,299
More of the rocks was weird.

2792
04:46:29,299 --> 04:46:32,950
It was, wasn't it?

2793
04:46:32,950 --> 04:46:34,470
First stream yet.

2794
04:46:34,470 --> 04:46:37,029
Ooh, this is in the desert.

2795
04:46:37,029 --> 04:46:38,799
Check this place out.

2796
04:46:38,799 --> 04:46:40,360
I just want to check out the two new zones

2797
04:46:40,360 --> 04:46:41,439
and then I'm going to go take a break.

2798
04:46:41,520 --> 04:46:54,869
Get the wood and then we'll play Pac-Man 99 for a while.

2799
04:46:54,869 --> 04:46:59,919
We got new shit.

2800
04:46:59,919 --> 04:47:07,139
Do you not like that?

2801
04:47:07,139 --> 04:47:08,259
There's just new stuff everywhere.

2802
04:47:08,259 --> 04:47:17,430
This is awesome.

2803
04:47:17,430 --> 04:47:22,380
Some tracks left by a small Pokemon.

2804
04:47:22,380 --> 04:47:25,090
What is that?

2805
04:47:25,090 --> 04:47:29,799
You eat?

2806
04:47:29,799 --> 04:47:37,639
Whoa, what are you doing, dude?

2807
04:47:37,639 --> 04:47:38,860
Come here.

2808
04:47:38,860 --> 04:47:45,549
You dance?

2809
04:47:45,549 --> 04:47:46,709
That's a good picture.

2810
04:47:46,709 --> 04:47:48,709
Shit, why would I take the camera away?

2811
04:47:48,709 --> 04:47:56,259
What am I, stupid?

2812
04:47:56,259 --> 04:48:02,529
That was cool.

2813
04:48:02,529 --> 04:48:03,490
Okay, I'll be honest.

2814
04:48:03,490 --> 04:48:07,290
I feel like I'm playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

2815
04:48:08,130 --> 04:48:09,250
I feel like I'm just changing and I have to do this.

2816
04:48:09,250 --> 04:48:10,529
I have to wind up the toy.

2817
04:48:10,529 --> 04:48:25,990
I have to go over here, take a photo, go to this one.

2818
04:48:25,990 --> 04:48:26,830
That was cool.

2819
04:48:26,830 --> 04:48:31,549
That was a good one.

2820
04:48:31,549 --> 04:48:34,700
I don't know, I can't.

2821
04:48:34,700 --> 04:48:40,779
Remember, you need to reload the gun.

2822
04:48:40,779 --> 04:48:42,060
This place is really open.

2823
04:48:42,060 --> 04:48:44,299
There's not a lot of places to hide.

2824
04:48:44,299 --> 04:48:47,220
Am I going up in a tornado?

2825
04:48:47,220 --> 04:48:48,259
Oh, no, no, no, okay.

2826
04:48:48,259 --> 04:48:54,000
I thought I was getting sucked up.

2827
04:48:54,000 --> 04:48:55,720
So cute.

2828
04:48:55,720 --> 04:49:09,580
So cute.

2829
04:49:09,580 --> 04:49:10,540
Did I get it?

2830
04:49:10,540 --> 04:49:18,540
I think so.

2831
04:49:18,540 --> 04:49:19,380
You want to eat?

2832
04:49:19,380 --> 04:49:24,869
Eat that.

2833
04:49:24,869 --> 04:49:35,159
Whoa, he burns it.

2834
04:49:35,159 --> 04:49:37,919
Ice cream truck.

2835
04:49:37,959 --> 04:49:41,990
You know, I watched a video not that long ago

2836
04:49:41,990 --> 04:49:45,819
of an ice cream truck dog compilation

2837
04:49:45,819 --> 04:49:48,459
with dogs just get in line

2838
04:49:48,459 --> 04:49:52,779
and like eat ice cream with the ice cream truck.

2839
04:49:52,779 --> 04:50:01,720
It was really cute.

2840
04:50:01,720 --> 04:50:02,560
Link it.

2841
04:50:02,560 --> 04:50:03,400
I can't link it.

2842
04:50:03,400 --> 04:50:10,259
I don't know where it even is.

2843
04:50:10,259 --> 04:50:13,060
How sad is your life that you'll watch that?

2844
04:50:13,060 --> 04:50:14,419
What?

2845
04:50:14,419 --> 04:50:16,060
It's just a cute video.

2846
04:50:16,060 --> 04:50:18,360
What the fuck?

2847
04:50:18,360 --> 04:50:25,279
What are you talking about?

2848
04:50:25,279 --> 04:50:26,119
I felt like, what?

2849
04:50:26,119 --> 04:50:28,720
If I'm like in a doctor's office waiting room or something,

2850
04:50:29,200 --> 04:50:33,319
I don't stay away from those like dog ice cream videos.

2851
04:50:33,319 --> 04:50:38,540
He's pissed.

2852
04:50:38,540 --> 04:50:39,740
Oh, he's going to eat.

2853
04:50:39,740 --> 04:50:52,900
You're not too mad to like not eat.

2854
04:50:52,900 --> 04:50:55,459
You can turn quickly with the D pad.

2855
04:50:55,459 --> 04:50:59,180
Oh, well, that's about five hours worth of gameplay

2856
04:50:59,180 --> 04:51:01,220
that I did not play correctly.

2857
04:51:21,020 --> 04:51:21,860
That was cool.

2858
04:51:21,860 --> 04:51:26,810
I like that area.

2859
04:51:26,810 --> 04:51:30,849
This is probably the best one.

2860
04:51:36,139 --> 04:51:40,700
Pacing the apple, eating the apple.

2861
04:51:40,700 --> 04:51:42,060
No, definitely the happy one.

2862
04:51:42,060 --> 04:51:46,169
I like that one.

2863
04:51:46,250 --> 04:51:56,419
There's one where he's right in the camera.

2864
04:51:56,419 --> 04:52:03,279
Hmm, that one.

2865
04:52:03,279 --> 04:52:05,240
Oh, this is a Vivillon.

2866
04:52:05,240 --> 04:52:11,720
It's a different version.

2867
04:52:11,720 --> 04:52:17,259
I didn't get a picture of it.

2868
04:52:17,259 --> 04:52:24,220
Ooh, that one.

2869
04:52:24,220 --> 04:52:29,439
And the one when he's opening the mouth.

2870
04:52:29,439 --> 04:52:33,919
That one's good too though.

2871
04:52:33,919 --> 04:52:40,340
I don't know, that one looks like Bowser.

2872
04:52:40,340 --> 04:52:42,659
I'm going to say this one.

2873
04:52:42,659 --> 04:52:47,169
No, this one.

2874
04:52:47,169 --> 04:52:57,209
All right, go.

2875
04:52:57,209 --> 04:52:59,409
I wish I could see high resolution versions of them

2876
04:52:59,409 --> 04:53:00,939
before I pick them.

2877
04:53:00,939 --> 04:53:02,180
You pick kind of like a shitty version

2878
04:53:02,180 --> 04:53:11,950
before you get to see what it actually looks like.

2879
04:53:11,950 --> 04:53:16,810
I like that one.

2880
04:53:17,650 --> 04:53:19,049
What's a perfect score?

2881
04:53:19,049 --> 04:53:28,439
What do you know?

2882
04:53:28,439 --> 04:53:34,180
6,000, 7,000?

2883
04:53:34,180 --> 04:53:36,720
Like 1,000, toilet, thank you.

2884
04:53:36,720 --> 04:53:37,639
No, it's not.

2885
04:53:37,639 --> 04:53:38,479
That was wrong.

2886
04:53:38,479 --> 04:53:47,220
It's like 6,000.

2887
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:48,220
6K is perfect.

2888
04:53:53,099 --> 04:53:54,099
I hate the original.

2889
04:54:02,169 --> 04:54:03,250
This is a boring baby game.

2890
04:54:03,250 --> 04:54:07,240
Please play Escape from Tarkov.

2891
04:54:07,240 --> 04:54:09,119
I would rather eat a rare steak

2892
04:54:09,119 --> 04:54:25,950
than play Escape from Tarkov.

2893
04:54:25,950 --> 04:54:28,990
You guys, who were the naysayers that said

2894
04:54:28,990 --> 04:54:30,590
that this was not a good photo?

2895
04:54:30,590 --> 04:54:35,240
That's a, I got diamonds.

2896
04:54:35,240 --> 04:54:44,830
Poor chick.

2897
04:54:44,830 --> 04:54:46,990
What's wrong with Escape from Tarkov?

2898
04:54:46,990 --> 04:54:48,340
Nothing.

2899
04:54:48,340 --> 04:54:50,500
Just don't want to play it.

2900
04:54:50,500 --> 04:54:52,299
If you presented me two options,

2901
04:54:52,299 --> 04:54:54,139
you have to either play Tarkov for an hour

2902
04:54:54,139 --> 04:54:55,299
or eat a rare steak.

2903
04:54:55,299 --> 04:54:58,000
I would eat the steak on camera right now.

2904
04:54:58,000 --> 04:54:59,000
I have nothing against Tarkov.

2905
04:54:59,000 --> 04:55:01,200
I just don't, I just do not want to play that.

2906
04:55:01,200 --> 04:55:08,369
I don't want to play that right now.

2907
04:55:08,369 --> 04:55:24,939
All right, what's the other place?

2908
04:55:24,939 --> 04:55:29,880
I think you're a really bad streamer.

2909
04:55:29,880 --> 04:55:30,700
You're terrible.

2910
04:55:30,700 --> 04:55:31,540
I hate you.

2911
04:55:31,540 --> 04:55:33,000
You're boring and lame and dumb and bad.

2912
04:55:33,000 --> 04:55:33,840
Not funny.

2913
04:55:33,840 --> 04:55:34,720
I went to middle school with you.

2914
04:55:34,720 --> 04:55:37,040
You were cool then, but not now.

2915
04:55:37,040 --> 04:55:40,909
I peaked at middle school.

2916
04:55:44,650 --> 04:55:47,990
How do you peak in middle school?

2917
04:55:47,990 --> 04:55:48,830
I don't understand that.

2918
04:55:48,830 --> 04:56:01,900
This is the beach.

2919
04:56:01,900 --> 04:56:07,060
Ooh, I like this place.

2920
04:56:07,060 --> 04:56:13,290
Ooh, I really like this place.

2921
04:56:13,290 --> 04:56:15,919
Like apples?

2922
04:56:15,919 --> 04:56:23,240
He's got boxing gloves.

2923
04:56:23,240 --> 04:56:35,459
Do something weird.

2924
04:56:35,459 --> 04:56:40,259
I don't know why that,

2925
04:56:40,259 --> 04:56:45,639
this looks like Patrick on drugs.

2926
04:56:45,639 --> 04:56:47,799
This is like crack Patrick.

2927
04:56:47,799 --> 04:56:48,840
I don't know why I think that.

2928
04:56:48,840 --> 04:56:50,439
I don't know why I'm seeing that.

2929
04:56:50,439 --> 04:56:53,540
What is that?

2930
04:56:53,540 --> 04:57:00,970
What the hell is that thing?

2931
04:57:00,970 --> 04:57:03,720
Whoa.

2932
04:57:09,000 --> 04:57:30,799
Oh my God.

2933
04:57:30,799 --> 04:57:33,000
Sounds like you're the one that's on crack.

2934
04:57:38,700 --> 04:57:40,340
I can do it if I try hard enough.

2935
04:57:51,080 --> 04:58:03,220
It's kind of moving.

2936
04:58:03,220 --> 04:58:06,279
You don't have that much depth.

2937
04:58:06,279 --> 04:58:17,299
What are you talking about?

2938
04:58:17,299 --> 04:58:21,630
I never do that again?

2939
04:58:21,630 --> 04:58:24,029
I'm going to at least a hundred more times

2940
04:58:24,029 --> 04:58:29,009
before my career ends.

2941
04:58:29,009 --> 04:58:30,610
Hey, if my career ends tomorrow,

2942
04:58:30,610 --> 04:58:32,290
if my career ended tomorrow,

2943
04:58:32,290 --> 04:58:33,369
I would upload a Twitter video

2944
04:58:33,369 --> 04:58:36,119
of me doing that a hundred times.

2945
04:58:36,119 --> 04:58:44,479
He's holding up middle fingers.

2946
04:58:44,479 --> 04:58:48,689
These things are cute.

2947
04:58:48,689 --> 04:58:49,529
How do you say this?

2948
04:58:49,529 --> 04:58:52,500
Piu-ku, Piu-ku-mu-ku.

2949
04:58:52,500 --> 04:58:59,770
Piu-ku-mu-ku?

2950
04:58:59,770 --> 04:59:00,729
You're going to fight over the,

2951
04:59:00,729 --> 04:59:05,099
what the hell?

2952
04:59:05,099 --> 04:59:16,880
That was weird.

2953
04:59:16,880 --> 04:59:23,400
That wasn't bad.

2954
04:59:23,400 --> 04:59:27,009
Or Sola?

2955
04:59:27,009 --> 04:59:32,520
You like apples.

2956
04:59:32,520 --> 04:59:33,360
All right.

2957
04:59:33,360 --> 04:59:44,259
Now you're going to do a funny little dance.

2958
04:59:44,259 --> 04:59:55,340
I don't know why I feel like it's going to take off.

2959
04:59:55,340 --> 04:59:56,180
What the?

2960
04:59:56,180 --> 04:59:57,139
What is that thing?

2961
04:59:57,139 --> 04:59:57,979
That's a Pokemon?

2962
04:59:57,979 --> 05:00:11,560
I thought that was an NPC.

2963
05:00:11,560 --> 05:00:17,590
I want to eat that apple.

2964
05:00:17,590 --> 05:00:19,619
No.

2965
05:00:19,619 --> 05:00:24,279
He's gone.

2966
05:00:24,279 --> 05:00:27,529
Pikachu, turn around here.

2967
05:00:27,529 --> 05:00:29,639
Pikachu.

2968
05:00:29,639 --> 05:00:30,479
Pikachu, look over here.

2969
05:00:30,479 --> 05:00:33,389
Look.

2970
05:00:33,389 --> 05:00:42,169
Pikachu, look.

2971
05:00:42,169 --> 05:00:46,959
Okay.

2972
05:00:46,959 --> 05:00:48,819
Dance.

2973
05:00:48,819 --> 05:00:54,880
You like to dance?

2974
05:00:54,880 --> 05:01:00,389
That was a Chad raw steak eater.

2975
05:01:00,389 --> 05:01:11,439
Chad real diarrhea haver.

2976
05:01:11,439 --> 05:01:17,400
These guys eat apples or anything?

2977
05:01:17,400 --> 05:01:25,049
That's cool.

2978
05:01:25,049 --> 05:01:26,830
I only have seven photos left.

2979
05:01:26,830 --> 05:01:36,889
Oh, well I'm done anyways, okay.

2980
05:01:36,889 --> 05:01:40,569
At somebody, you told me this guy was funny.

2981
05:01:40,569 --> 05:01:43,439
Oh no.

2982
05:01:43,439 --> 05:01:48,680
Oh no.

2983
05:01:48,680 --> 05:01:52,930
Did I just ruin a friend circle?

2984
05:01:52,930 --> 05:01:53,930
Used to be.

2985
05:01:53,930 --> 05:01:54,930
Get out of here.

2986
05:01:54,930 --> 05:01:55,770
I'm still funny.

2987
05:01:55,770 --> 05:01:59,430
I still got it.

2988
05:01:59,430 --> 05:02:01,189
Hey, dude, you told me this guy was funny.

2989
05:02:01,189 --> 05:02:06,119
What the fuck, dude?

2990
05:02:06,119 --> 05:02:10,279
Cartoon steam just came out of that guy's fucking neck

2991
05:02:10,279 --> 05:02:13,930
underneath his shirt.

2992
05:02:13,930 --> 05:02:14,770
I like that one.

2993
05:02:14,770 --> 05:02:18,159
There's a better one though.

2994
05:02:18,159 --> 05:02:19,000
How was it?

2995
05:02:19,000 --> 05:02:26,560
I guess I'll take it.

2996
05:02:26,560 --> 05:02:32,380
That one.

2997
05:02:32,380 --> 05:02:35,319
Guess I got a picture of that.

2998
05:02:35,319 --> 05:02:36,919
Definitely the one with the hand.

2999
05:02:36,919 --> 05:02:45,319
Definitely the one with the big flop.

3000
05:02:45,319 --> 05:02:49,099
Are we this one?

3001
05:02:49,099 --> 05:03:10,520
I got him from far away.

3002
05:03:10,520 --> 05:03:11,520
That's a good one.

3003
05:03:17,200 --> 05:03:18,080
All right, I'm gonna take a break.

3004
05:03:18,080 --> 05:03:20,680
I'm gonna go get the wood.

3005
05:03:20,680 --> 05:03:21,880
I'm gonna come back.

3006
05:03:21,880 --> 05:03:26,959
I'm gonna play Pac-Man 99 for a little while.

3007
05:03:26,959 --> 05:03:28,799
And then I will say goodbye.

3008
05:03:28,799 --> 05:03:34,919
I will say farewell.

3009
05:03:34,919 --> 05:03:36,759
I will play a lot of Pac-Man 99.

3010
05:03:36,759 --> 05:03:40,750
I'll try to get at least in the top 10.

3011
05:03:40,750 --> 05:03:44,159
And we'll look at the wood.

3012
05:03:44,159 --> 05:03:50,119
Okay, you want my review of Pokemon Snap?

3013
05:03:50,119 --> 05:03:51,740
It's cute.

3014
05:03:51,740 --> 05:03:57,220
That was a cute game.

3015
05:03:57,220 --> 05:04:00,340
Looks like there's a lot to do.

3016
05:04:00,340 --> 05:04:02,099
Looks like there's a lot of things to see.

3017
05:04:02,139 --> 05:04:05,639
A lot of completionists will love it

3018
05:04:05,639 --> 05:04:11,939
if they like Pokemon.

3019
05:04:11,939 --> 05:04:13,180
I enjoyed it.

3020
05:04:13,180 --> 05:04:15,529
I thought it was very fun.

3021
05:04:15,529 --> 05:04:18,419
But I don't know who any of these people are.

3022
05:04:18,419 --> 05:04:21,900
I'm your friend that came over in the middle of the season

3023
05:04:21,900 --> 05:04:22,939
that has not seen the show,

3024
05:04:22,939 --> 05:04:25,159
but just said, I don't care.

3025
05:04:25,159 --> 05:04:26,560
And you're like, oh, okay.

3026
05:04:26,560 --> 05:04:29,880
This is like episode eight of like middle of the season,

3027
05:04:29,880 --> 05:04:31,680
like the only 12 episodes.

3028
05:04:31,680 --> 05:04:34,000
Like I don't care.

3029
05:04:34,000 --> 05:04:36,360
So for that being that person,

3030
05:04:36,360 --> 05:04:45,799
I thought it was pretty good.

3031
05:04:45,799 --> 05:04:48,959
So let's play Pac-Man.

3032
05:04:48,959 --> 05:04:52,240
I will return in about two minutes.

3033
05:04:52,240 --> 05:04:57,650
And we'll play Pac-Man 99.

3034
05:04:57,650 --> 05:04:58,490
What did I get for present?

3035
05:04:58,490 --> 05:04:59,759
Hold on.

3036
05:04:59,759 --> 05:05:02,639
Oh no, nevermind.

3037
05:05:02,639 --> 05:05:03,639
Hey, look at that.

3038
05:05:03,639 --> 05:05:10,580
50 Pokemon species.

3039
05:05:10,580 --> 05:05:11,740
Fighting type.

3040
05:05:11,740 --> 05:05:13,419
Oh, that's cool.

3041
05:05:13,419 --> 05:05:14,630
All right.

3042
05:05:14,630 --> 05:05:15,549
Let me make sure this saves

3043
05:05:15,549 --> 05:05:19,659
in case I want to play it again.

3044
05:05:19,659 --> 05:05:21,060
Five hours, 50 Pokemon.

3045
05:05:21,060 --> 05:05:22,680
That's true.

3046
05:05:22,680 --> 05:05:23,880
All right, I'll be right back.

3047
05:05:23,880 --> 05:05:25,040
See you guys in a minute.
