1
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,859
Going on, you know, a lot of happy birthdays. Appreciate that. Thanks for the birthday wishes.

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:59,979
33. It's good to be 33. I'm not almost 40. You know what I mean? So today I've got a few things

3
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:06,760
to talk about. Let's go over some things. I might sound a little different. That's okay.

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,019
I have changed setups. You're not going to believe where I am right now. I could tell you where I am

5
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:23,379
but you wouldn't believe me, but I don't have the camera set up to prove what's going on.

6
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:35,189
I am lying on the ground right now. Isn't that interesting? I got like a beanbag chair.

7
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,510
I'm like lying on the ground. I've got a set. I'm like lying down and playing today.

8
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:50,250
This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be so cool. I can't wait. Is he zonked? No,

9
00:01:51,530 --> 00:02:01,859
I am absolutely sober, but I'm going into full relaxation mode today. Can you show us? I'll

10
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,659
probably set a camera up here and then I don't know if this is permanent. So this could be

11
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,180
pretty temporary, but I, you know, I just felt like today I'm like, you know what?

12
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,020
I want to like lie down and just, well, I'm not lying on my back. Let's be really honest and clear

13
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,300
here. I'm sitting up, but I'm sitting in like a beanbag chair. It's a, it's not a beanbag chair.

14
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:38,759
I keep making that up, but I am reclined. He's in a hospital bed. I have really retired. Yeah.

15
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:47,139
I'm screaming from the, you know, retirement home. Don't fall asleep. No, if anything,

16
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:53,319
this is going to be, I feel like this is going to be better to stream from. I can just sit back now.

17
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,810
All right. Let's, let's do real talk for a second. I actually have a lot of trouble,

18
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,530
which I've been realizing lately, the last like, I want to say two or three years.

19
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,919
I know it has a lot to do with the chest and back problem, but sitting up,

20
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,610
does anybody else hate sitting up in a chair? Sitting straight up with like my arms up is,

21
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,129
it causes a lot of pain in, especially nowadays. So I was like, you know what? I'm going to try it.

22
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,650
I'm going to try just lying down, like sitting down, sitting back, reclining.

23
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:34,199
This is a trial run. Let's see how it goes. Yeah. It's going to be back. You can play CS2. I don't

24
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:44,620
think so. It's way better. Well, if you're sitting up, you want your posture to be good,

25
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:53,099
but if you're leaning back a little and put my knees up, I bet you in an hour, I talk about how

26
00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:00,169
much I hate this. I'm going to be leaning back like this with, and I'm just going to be like,

27
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:06,740
I hate this. All right. Give me one second. Let me, I just want to grab a drink. Be right back.

28
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:42,540
Okay. I got my drink. So is this game any good? I saw this game being played. It looked really fun.

29
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:50,459
Is it fun? It looks good. What are you drinking? Something really weird.

30
00:05:51,019 --> 00:06:04,069
It's a sun-kissed berry lemonade. We're going full recline streamer mode now. It's all right.

31
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:19,370
It's pretty good. Going complete food mode. All right. So what, let's go. All right. So what,

32
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,829
what's the best character? Who should I play as? Do they have stats or is it just, they're just

33
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:33,189
characters? What about Resident Evil 4 DLC? Oh yeah. A hundred percent. Maybe not, not today.

34
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:46,699
Do the otter? I just burped wicked loud. I really am retired. Did that come through the mic?

35
00:06:46,699 --> 00:07:00,500
That was like, do otter? They're all really cute. They are. I'm going to go. No, no, no.

36
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:24,569
Ooh, ooh. Maybe royalty-free Garfield. Should I be royalty-free Garfield or all right. We're

37
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:37,500
going to go with Lloyd. Do I have this stuff? No, I don't. All right. Well, we'll go Lloyd.

38
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:46,870
So now we just do quick match, right? Is that how this works? You should do dark Lloyd. I can do

39
00:07:46,870 --> 00:08:02,420
dark Lloyd. Oh, I don't have enough money. Okay. Well, let's go do the tutorial. All right. Time

40
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:18,019
to play. Do you dye your hair still? It's completely natural. Okay. Left and right.

41
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:27,060
Move on to the next room when you're ready. Let's go. You see that wee thingy that just

42
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,379
popped out? It's pretty sloppy. That is the stamina bar. You need stamina to run,

43
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,460
attack, climb, or carry things around. Okay, there's the stamina bar. Better keep good

44
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,740
track of it at all times. I'm like choking myself. A little run up lets you jump further.

45
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,389
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. So run up. Wait, what did I miss? Easy. All right.

46
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,559
You can grab everything in the game. Pick up the green cube thing.

47
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,600
Oh, I like lying down and screaming. This is awesome. I'm starting a new trend. Yes,

48
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,919
yes. Just like that. Calling it right now. Now, put the cube thing onto the metal pressure

49
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:15,000
sensor to unlock the door. Chop, chop. Right here. Easy. This is maximum chill. That's right.

50
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:26,120
Did I not get it? You didn't invent lying down, but I invented lying down and screaming at the

51
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:40,539
same time. No, I didn't. Okay. All right. All right. What do I do? Hold X to charge

52
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:52,299
and then release. That didn't really work. What do you think invented means?

53
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,460
You are the first person to do something. You invented it and then you patented it. See,

54
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:12,200
the problem is I didn't patent this yet. That's what I need to do. Close enough. Yeah.

55
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,299
See that punching bag? Time to learn a couple of moves. Yeah, well, there's a punch in the game.

56
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:25,669
A couple of jabs for a start. It automatically just got a full letter grid. Quite a sizable

57
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:36,149
hedge you've got there, don't you? Headbutt. B. Where's Lloyd? This is the tutorial. I don't

58
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:43,940
think Lloyd is in the tutorial. Sorry. Forgot to mention, you can get knocked out by your own

59
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,419
attacks from time to time. I won't forget again. It'll be a 10 if there are cars in this game. If

60
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:59,190
there are cars in the game, it's a 10.0. While running? Press X while running. Oh, you mean like

61
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:13,799
this? I feel like this is like a toddler having a tantrum. Those are tantrum arms. Okay. Jump.

62
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:26,600
Wait. I missed. Oh my God. I'm bad at this. All right. Turn this way and do it.

63
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,669
Just me, or is there a nice lollipop in the presentation box? Lollipop? Let's break it out.

64
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,750
Give me it. Give me this thing. To pick up, wait to align your hands with the handle.

65
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,490
All right. Now we... I'm going to like this a lot, I think. All right. How do I use it?

66
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,070
To correctly pick the weapon up. Correctly. Like this? This is like this. Okay. Oh, and you can't

67
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:02,980
let go of the grab button. Hit the punching bag with the lollipop. Oh, I'm going to bash somebody's

68
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,850
head in with this thing. That's what you're supposed to do, right? I'm going full violence

69
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:22,789
mode and I don't even know if that's what the goal of the game. Double press it. Okay. Hold Y

70
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:34,679
while grabbing the net. Okay. Hold Y. Oh, we have to grab it. Right. Okay. I don't do anything else

71
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:46,200
because it's... Oh, it's automatic. Okay. Let's go. Dodge roll. Are there iframes in this game?

72
00:12:46,200 --> 00:13:00,659
Because that would be really funny if there were. Okay. Well, I missed. No. Okay. No. All right.

73
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:13,750
Wait. That was good. Clap for me. Clap. Beat the crocodile. Oh my God. All right. So...

74
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:28,460
Throw him off. What the fuck? I win.

75
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,960
That was not too bad at all. Next room. All right. Cool. Whenever you're ready.

76
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:46,299
I got one star. That's pretty good. Except it's not. Why would you want... You're going to give

77
00:13:46,299 --> 00:14:05,990
me stars in a tutorial? All right. Quick match. Let's go. I don't have any friends.

78
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:21,429
How come I'm... Where's my... Where's the other character? Am I the dog? Don't ever do that slurp

79
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:29,049
again. Well, now I'm going to do it because you just said not to. Three, two, one.

80
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:48,279
Okay. Choose the map you want to play. How about this one? Does it matter? Don't get carried away

81
00:14:48,279 --> 00:15:03,029
by water and stay alive. Oh. Why are you really goofy today? I think that's just who I am, man.

82
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:21,960
That's the worst sound of the year. No, not even close. No way. Oh, here we go. All right. I want

83
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,899
to be... I want to be somebody that nobody else is though. Oh, I have streamer mode on. Is that

84
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:43,139
a good thing? Probably. I'll be the duck. So it's all about just beat the shit out of each other.

85
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:51,350
I think that's a great title for a game. Don't you think that's a huge grabber for a title?

86
00:15:51,909 --> 00:16:01,529
Beat the shit out of each other. Oh my god. I wasn't even looking. Am I already dead? All right.

87
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:12,230
I'm ready. Okay. That was bad. That was very bad. I'm all right. Am I all right? Get back up here.

88
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:23,659
How do I climb? What? Oh, this is all wear on teams. All right. Enough with that. Give me these.

89
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:30,980
Give me the nunchucks. Oh, now you're in trouble. I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come over here and...

90
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:45,080
What is wrong with me? What is wrong with my character? Get over here. Get back. Get back. Get back.

91
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:59,269
I didn't let go of items? All right. Get rid of them. Shit. We can do it. We can do it. We're fine.

92
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,769
We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. What is this?

93
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,069
Headbutt. Headbutt, right? Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. We have to climb.

94
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,599
Get off of me. All right. Now, I'll get a step on his fingers when he gets up here.

95
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:38,440
Oh, shit. That's bad. No. Wait. I'm all right. I'm all right. Everything's fine. I'm still alive.

96
00:17:43,380 --> 00:18:01,400
Oh my god. It's... I'm still holding on. Am I still alive? We won. We did it. All right. We're good.

97
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:21,829
Smash somebody with a frying pan. This is not how you pick that up. Yeah. Get out of here. Get away

98
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:56,180
from me. All right. I have... I have the fry... Oh my god. Get up. Get up. Whoa. Okay. I need to...

99
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,500
Okay. Should you grab them when they're still alive? Oh, wait. Oh my god. I have an opportunity right now.

100
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:12,039
Didn't work. Oh my god. I'm gonna crush him. He's gonna get squished like the juicer. Whatever this

101
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:27,400
thing is. He's in like the meat grinder. Oh god. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Oh, I'm unconscious right now.

102
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:51,029
Do not hit me with that, please. All right. We're good. Get up. Pick him up with both hands. Yes. I got it.

103
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,960
All right. Just hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna hold on for... I'm absolutely gonna hold on.

104
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:11,140
Who is throwing stuff at my head? We're all wedged into this hole. How did we all get in? No.

105
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:19,779
No. No. Grab it. He's holding my head under the water. That's illegal. You can't do that.

106
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:39,160
That's illegal. Oh, boy. There's no more boat. Oh. All right. I get it now. Let's go. Oh, shit. My

107
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:47,140
headphones fell out. Sorry. They're not paying attention. Should you always go for like running

108
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,349
kicks or what? Baseball bat. Give it to me. No. What am I doing? Just get up there now.

109
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:07,259
Shouldn't I climb to the very top right now? You piece of shit. Don't get eliminated immediately,

110
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:27,700
really. What just happened to me? What was that? What just happened? Oh. I only had three. I had

111
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:42,309
two. Did I spend all my coins? All right. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm gonna throw a coin at this guy.

112
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:57,160
Oh, I just missed. Oh, they're in trouble now. All right. Okay. Here we go. Ready?

113
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,740
That's not where I just aimed. Why did it go all the way up here? My crosshair was right here.

114
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:22,440
Garfield's on your team. Oh, whoops. Here we go. Nice. Very, very nice. Ah, shit. Garfield's got it.

115
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:49,299
Don't let him take you in there. Right in the face. I don't want to throw this. I'm afraid I'll hurt

116
00:22:49,299 --> 00:23:11,079
him. Dude, that was like a snipe, bro. Nevermind. Damn it. I'm so bad at this. Take the shot. That

117
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:22,920
was really close though, you have to admit. Where are they? All right. Did we win? All right. No.

118
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,079
All right. Let's go. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. Ready. Garfield, we're gonna get this right now.

119
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:40,970
Check this out. I got a gun now. Pick it up with both hands. Start whacking people.

120
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:57,579
Get over here. All right. At least I scared him. I almost just walked into the fucking like,

121
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:15,220
hold on. Oh, how do I pick them up? How do you pick people up? How do you pick people? How do

122
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,099
I let go of the bat? Isn't it right? Oh, it's double tap right trigger. That's why I was just

123
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:37,720
tapping right trigger. Just get up. I'm going up right now. Forget about anything else. Yeah. This

124
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,880
is all that matters. It's just whoever's at the highest point. So who cares? I'm just gonna stand

125
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:54,970
at the very top of this thing. Why would you do anything else? Just hold on right here. Don't move.

126
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:13,140
Oh, you idiot. No, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on tight. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold

127
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:23,960
on. Hold on. Oh, that's bad. I'm good. All right. Just me and you. Ooh, somebody missed big time.

128
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:42,099
And no, please get a shot. Beautiful. Unbelievable shot. All right. Just hold,

129
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:53,220
hold right here. All right. Am I safe? Yeah, there we go. All right. That's a win. We're good.

130
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:03,500
All right. This is it. This is, this is for all the marbles right here. Do not put me into the

131
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:14,539
fucking juice machine. I'll put you in there though. Let's go. Oh, it's a rocket comes out.

132
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,900
I thought it was the thing that opens and just crushes whoever's in there. Oh, it does both.

133
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:37,829
Okay. That's whatever. Ooh. See you later. Get over here. Why would a submarine have that? I

134
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:50,019
don't know. It's a goofy cartoon game. As long as I, I'm doing the same strat I did last time.

135
00:26:51,319 --> 00:27:15,180
Seriously. Why is he going so slow? He's so, why did I do that? No, don't even think about it.

136
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:29,049
What did you just threw it to me? And I pick, I, I, what? I caught it. Put it down. Why did I pick,

137
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:44,650
I caught it out of the air. I didn't mean to do that. I think it just ran into the pole. Oh my

138
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:53,019
God. What am I doing? Why did I do that? Honestly, if as long as blue doesn't win, that was bad.

139
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh, that's not good. It's very bad. Well, as long as blue doesn't win, we're good. All right. I

140
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:25,940
gotta help. Hey, we did it. Nice. Is that, that's worth, is that worth something? Nice job,

141
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:37,529
Garfield. You did it. I don't know why. I just, I don't know. That, that character, that character

142
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:43,339
had a punchable face. That character had a punchable face. That just went right. By the way,

143
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:49,900
what is up with that? Have you guys ever noticed that like, oh, that, oh yeah, that guy has a

144
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:57,509
wicked punchable face. Why is like your first impression of somebody to physically assault

145
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:12,460
them? What, what's up with that? Oh, it took a picture. I see. Your face is punchable.

146
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,299
But you know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, yeah. That guy's got a wicked punchable face.

147
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,450
You're already like having a fantasy of beating this person up. You don't even know who this

148
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:42,279
person is. You just said it though. I was setting up the joke. I was going to bring that up like

149
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:55,099
two weeks ago. All right. What's up? What's the fun one? Winter is, oh, well I guess we don't

150
00:29:55,099 --> 00:30:11,109
even have a choice. Is anybody, is people saying play with other people? Is that, I know this is

151
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:16,069
like a multiplayer game and everything, but I kind of just wanted to try it. I don't know how

152
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:21,269
long I'm going to play this game for. So I don't, I mean, I know I might be here for playing this

153
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,910
game for like an hour or two or three, but I don't know if I want to be like, Hey everybody,

154
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:33,559
let's do it. And then like 20 minutes later, I'm like, yeah, I'm kind of done. All right. This is

155
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:54,630
really fun though. I like it. All right. So we just have to stay alive. Wait, wait. Oh, it's not

156
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:01,380
stay alive. It's okay. I was being it. Okay. It's not stay alive. It's, I didn't pay attention at

157
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:09,160
all. All right. So you have to score a goal in a circle. Sorry. All right. I get it now. It's

158
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,880
the first time I've played it. Okay. I'm going to go. Don't wait. You'll never be the first person

159
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:24,599
that runs for the dodge ball. All right. That's fine. What is, what goal is ours? Because that's

160
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:32,099
incredibly embarrassing if I don't do it the right way. What goal is ours? What team am I on?

161
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:55,430
What team am I on? Blue team. All right. Good. Oh, right. It's right up over our heads.

162
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:07,640
Okay. So we want to score on that goal in front of us. I'm really upset that Garfield's not there.

163
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:16,359
Oh, it's okay. Yeah. The whole time that it was explaining, I was looking over here,

164
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:28,250
talking about the punchable face thing. I wasn't even looking. I'm scoring a goal. Get off me.

165
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:41,190
How long did you stay down for? All right. I'm good. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got the ball. I

166
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,150
got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball. I got the ball.

167
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:08,789
Shit. I tried to drop kick. I like the gorilla. The gorilla's cool. You can move the camera. Oh,

168
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:22,490
shit. Right stick, I guess. I just tried to do the same thing and I got hit. Really? We just

169
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:36,789
got annihilated. Is it actually five to nothing? What is happening right now? I'm going, I'm jumping

170
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,190
in and drop kicking immediately. I'm going to do the same thing they just did to me.

171
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:47,900
I pressed B instead of A. Let go of me. How do you get somebody to let go of you?

172
00:33:56,009 --> 00:34:07,559
Okay. How do I stop this guy from doing this? Somebody help. Good. Good. Good. Good.

173
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:35,300
Clear shot. Clear shot. Yes. We got one goal. They disconnected. Did they? Do not. Oh my god,

174
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:48,010
how? All right. That one needs a little more practice. This gorilla scored, I think,

175
00:34:48,010 --> 00:35:14,630
all of their goals. No, I want to be right in the middle. What the hell? Is he biting me? He's

176
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:38,519
biting me. Did you see Destiny 2's DLC? No. All right. All right. Let's go. Do you like frosty

177
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,519
flakes? Yeah. Frosted flakes, but it was too long of a name, so I had to get rid of the E and D.

178
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:51,800
The name was too long. What about sorcery? We'll go back to sorcery probably in this coming week,

179
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,400
next week maybe. All right. I want to do beat up bridge 100%. That looks like the absolute best

180
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:18,869
one. Stay on the bridge and stay alive. You got it. I think the problem was I wanted to be the

181
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:29,300
goose and I was playing as the duck. I think that was, I think that was the mistake. Your

182
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,900
shout out for frozen red grapes literally changed my life. Thank you. Honest to God. I'm glad to

183
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:42,250
hear that. I'm seeing a lot of sames right now. I'm seeing a lot of sames. That's great.

184
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:51,460
They hurt my teeth. All right. Let me, let me give you a little bit of a tip. You, this is

185
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,820
very important. A lot of people that do frozen grapes, they fuck the whole thing up. So listen

186
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:06,409
closely. Okay. The grapes, they need to be in the freezer for at least a whole day. This takes a

187
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:11,690
whole day. It takes like six plus hours to get, they need to be frozen solid, frozen solid.

188
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:21,780
Take them out. And then once they're out, you, I lost. Um, that was okay. Uh, anyways. So what

189
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:31,369
were we talking about? Okay. Frozen grapes. Did I actually just lose? Okay. So put them in the

190
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:36,570
freezer for at least six to eight hours. If you've frozen solid, when you take them out of the

191
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,769
freezer, don't just eat them right away. I know it's like, Oh, here they are frozen grapes. Let

192
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:48,170
them sit out for 15 to 20 minutes, maybe like 10 minutes. They'll be a little bit softer,

193
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:53,369
but still frozen and chewy on the inside. I, it is the greatest snack ever invented.

194
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:04,250
I invented it. I just want to make sure that we all can attribute it to me. Did I miss with the

195
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:16,599
bomb? Yeah. You invented it. Uh, also somebody said frozen blueberries. And I said, Oh, intriguing.

196
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:39,449
I had them. They're wonderful. Why the fuck did I just do that? Okay. Yeah. I will reiterate this

197
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:49,449
one more time. Regular grapes. They're not as good to me. And the thought of eating a handful

198
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:54,889
of grapes is like, Hmm, that's okay. I cannot get enough of these frozen grapes. I can't get enough

199
00:38:54,889 --> 00:39:03,349
of them. I have, let me tell you something. I've been to the grocery store three different times

200
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:11,110
to get another big container of grapes. The last time before this, that I got a container of grapes,

201
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:17,179
I didn't even eat half of them. I don't think. And it's like, Oh shit. I don't like doing that.

202
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:21,900
Right. So you buy like the smaller container to make sure I'm buying the big ass container

203
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,139
and I'm freezing them all. And I'm eating the whole fucking thing. Not in one sitting,

204
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:49,909
obviously, but I can do some head butts. Wait, that's not a bad idea. Get away from the bomb.

205
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:58,409
He's trying to like put it in my mouth. Why there's so many of these.

206
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:24,309
Holy shit. I just did it. And I was unconscious when it happened. Cool. We did it again. No,

207
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:50,300
get off me. Thank you so much. You just saved my life. Not good. Oh my God. Why? I just went

208
00:40:50,300 --> 00:41:05,239
flying. It'll hit somebody, whatever. I'm just dumped my entire drink on me. Yeah. Frozen

209
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:10,920
blueberries are awesome, but frozen grapes. Oh my goodness. It just changes everything.

210
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:21,539
Speaking of somebody that actually finds it kind of difficult to put fruits into his diet. I can

211
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:27,380
do vegetables, right? But there's something about a fruit, like eating an orange or an apple or,

212
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:33,340
yeah, I'm going to eat a bunch of melon today. That kind of just doesn't happen. This thing is

213
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:40,199
vertical. Bananas are great. I like to blend bananas in a smoothie, but if you're having

214
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:46,519
trouble getting fruits in your diet, is it no jokes around? It's a great way to do it.

215
00:41:46,519 --> 00:42:06,539
Damn it. You should talk about tuna fish again. Okay. So what about the Silent Hill 2 remake?

216
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:21,500
Is it out? Remember, you're not even playing the game. I was playing. Watch this. I just,

217
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:40,650
he tripped on it. You should try eating a cold orange in the shower. I've had a can of Coke in

218
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:51,880
the shower and that was kind of cool. It's been a very long time. I've had a freezing cold,

219
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,500
like a really ice cold can of Coke. There's something about it. I don't know. I don't

220
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,530
recommend you do this, but I remember just slurping it down and I didn't even care if

221
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,449
it got all over me. I didn't even care. It was like, oh yeah, I'm going to slam this.

222
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:21,429
I want to pick up the right way. No, you know, I didn't pick it up the right way.

223
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:40,360
Why didn't I do that? How come he didn't use his other hand? Yep. Okay. See ya.

224
00:43:41,079 --> 00:44:07,659
Oh, the tables have turned. Give me the gun. Gun. It's like woke me up.

225
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:26,500
Put that down. That's one. Holy shit. We did it. That's another win. That's a,

226
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:34,090
that's a W right there. You can call it a cleanup job if you want, but that was still,

227
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:45,610
hold on. I just spilt this shit. I'm an idiot. Did I a little bit? Whatever. I'm in the picture. I

228
00:44:45,610 --> 00:45:09,239
don't care. Play this with Vinny. Thank you so much. She's rescuing me. Yeah, I got it. It's

229
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:17,239
good. It's just in my, it's just on my hand. I got to get used to that. I got, I'm a, I'm a,

230
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:39,989
I'm a reclined streamer now. Gator Valley. Do this one. Show us the setup. Uh, I didn't really

231
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:45,239
have time to put the webcam in, but you'll see it. And you're all going to think I'm

232
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:53,429
out of my fucking mind, but it's all right. Cause I'm comfortable here. And who cares people? Uh,

233
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:58,869
yeah. My stream set up. I've got all these like lights and I've got like a green screen and I've

234
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:03,179
got like stuff. I have like that Reddit shelf, right? Like, Oh, I'm going to put stuff on it.

235
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,820
I'm everything's on the ground right now. I'm literally on the ground and I kind of like it

236
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,820
here. I kind of like it just sitting here against like with a beanbag chair. That's not a beanbag

237
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:23,849
chair. I don't think I don't, I don't even care. It's fun. I like it. Uh, I'm going to stay with

238
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:34,699
the goose. There's nothing quite like being on the floor streamer. Yeah. And God damn it. I wasn't

239
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:45,400
even looking. All right. I think we're teams, right? Yeah. It's like a candy factory. Oh,

240
00:46:45,400 --> 00:47:05,619
we eat the candy, bro. Get off me. Oh, wait, are we taking the, I didn't pay any attention.

241
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:11,320
Are we taking the candy back to our base? And in one sentence, what's the goal?

242
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:41,670
Steal the candy. Okay. I'm just going to be the muscle.

243
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,780
Ooh, that was a big one. All right. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

244
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:20,250
I am clobbering this dude. Oh my God. I killed him. You can kill people. All right. It's only

245
00:48:20,250 --> 00:49:03,849
us here. We should be fine. Are we winning? Shit. I'm I'm I helped quite a bit. Actually.

246
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:31,480
I, that was, I helped quite a bit. Where am I? Damn it. I got an egg coin. Cool. The rabbits

247
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:42,219
are holding hands. Are they kind of remarkable? They actually could go up there is gambling.

248
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:54,550
Ooh, really? Okay. Don't tell them about that. Well, it's too late. I already did. Oh man,

249
00:49:54,550 --> 00:50:03,719
this one looks kind of crazy. Frozen grapes are great, but if you hold on, let me see what you

250
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:10,489
said. Combine them with whipped cream. Hold on. I need to know that strat. It looks like somebody

251
00:50:10,489 --> 00:50:19,079
has a frozen grape strategy. Have you tried carbonating them in a whipped cream dispenser?

252
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:29,420
Huh? Carbonated grapes? I don't, I don't even know what that means, but it sounds kind of

253
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:35,510
intriguing. You mean like you mash them up and whip them up with a, and then you put them in

254
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,070
like heavy cream and put them in a dispenser? That actually sounds kind of cool. You can do

255
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:47,989
that with like any kind of fruit, right? All right. I got to pay attention. That was,

256
00:50:48,550 --> 00:51:00,840
I hope that was not a teammate. I don't, it might've been. Ooh, get out of here. Get out of

257
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:14,039
here. No. Oh, I freaked out. Oh, that was a victory right there. I freaked out. We still won.

258
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:34,599
Oh, I didn't. Oh, that hurt a lot. What if I just stay on the ground? Will anyone come get me? Um,

259
00:51:34,599 --> 00:52:02,440
who has the electricity? Don't ever give me a weapon. I'm going to stand over here. Oh,

260
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:18,150
is there a taunt button? I hope there is. Oh, what is going on? Get off me. There's tasers.

261
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:45,159
Can I have some? Pick him up. Pick him up. Oh my God. You have to be fucking kidding me.

262
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:48,280
I'm trying to grab him and he just holds on with one hand. Like he's,

263
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:12,570
has a fucking little kid's wagon behind him. A whole wagon? Like those little kid wagons that

264
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:28,389
you drag. All right, let's stay back here together. Oh, okay. I'm not very good at this.

265
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:45,349
I went for a super move and it didn't do anything. Oh man. Oh man. I just wanted to

266
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:54,730
punch that guy in the face so bad. There was so much power in that punch. If it hit anybody,

267
00:53:54,730 --> 00:54:10,170
it would have gotten annihilated. It's getting intense though. Ooh, big kick.

268
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:26,630
I mean, we got a 10 out of 10 cameraman here and saw the whole thing. This is a formal request for

269
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:33,030
you to play Baldur's Gate. Holly and I have actually been playing it off screen. Not a

270
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:45,619
whole lot though. Where am I? Just barely got into it. Oh, hold on. Actually, let me go see

271
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:58,019
the other stuff. I can do, I have money now, right? I have like coins or something. Okay,

272
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:14,360
level up. I got 1500 cookies and a bacon avatar. Okay, cool. So where are these eggs?

273
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:29,050
How do you like it so far? It's really, really, really cool. I like that it's kind of, you just

274
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:33,369
can sort of go wherever you want really. There's that, you know, there's a ton of

275
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,820
main mission storyline stuff, but you can kind of just walk in a direction and just kind of

276
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:54,679
do whatever you want. Okay. Surprise eggs. How many do I have? One? Okay. I can do one egg.

277
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:57,880
Let's go. Is it worth doing it like this? Or I think this, no, that's end game currency.

278
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:16,409
All right. What do we get? Character. I'm playing a, a gnome sorcerer focusing on lightning. Pink

279
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:45,860
hammer. Ooh, okay. That's right. Laughing my ass off. That's you. Of course it's always sorcery.

280
00:56:45,860 --> 00:57:04,280
Well, sorcery is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm going to compare it to sorcery. No,

281
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:17,269
I don't want to do this one again. This one was too hard. Can you review the game immediately?

282
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:24,170
That might take a long time. I have a feeling that's going to take a little bit.

283
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:34,409
I feel like I've seen the amount of the game that amounts to the first preview at the movie

284
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:49,960
theater. Well, you're gonna have to give me a little bit. Oh my God. Hell yeah. Did you win

285
00:57:49,960 --> 00:58:03,510
any F-Zero games? Holly and I have been obsessed with F-Zero 99. I've come in third place overall

286
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:15,579
one time. I took a screenshot to prove it just in case anyone didn't believe it. There's a lie.

287
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:24,059
Well, it's no, it isn't. It's for real. But realistically at this point I can get into the

288
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:30,869
top, like top 15, top 20. Very, very much consistently. Pretty much every time.

289
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:48,949
I like this character a lot. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're way stronger. Why?

290
00:58:52,389 --> 00:58:58,789
Let me up. Pull me up. Pull me up. Come on. Up, up, up, up. Pull us up. Pull us up, dude. Come on. Pull us up.

291
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:20,679
Pull us up, dude. Please pull us up. I was trying to let him go, but okay. It's all right. Can I get in the

292
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:46,869
cockpit? What the hell was that? Dude, he hit me in the hands and I shot the gun straight in the air.

293
00:59:54,219 --> 01:00:21,449
Yes. Wait. Yes. Do not get eliminated first. Come on. Thank you, whoever did that. Thank you.

294
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:26,539
Actually, thank you very much. I'm a hammerhead. I should be hitting people with the head.

295
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:44,409
Get out of here. Oh, I'm on your team. I'm, hey, what are you doing? Why did you do that?

296
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:49,050
Why? He just saw red. He just saw red. He didn't even know. I don't think he even knew.

297
01:00:49,929 --> 01:01:03,110
All right. We're kind of just fucking this guy up. That was revenge. Did I shoot him before? No.

298
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,219
Revenge? Why are you saying? Wait, really? Oh, no. That's not good. All right. I deserved it.

299
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:29,559
That's very, dude, I'm getting carried so hard. You tased him. But all right. But here's the thing.

300
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:35,239
I didn't mean to. He meant to punch me in the face and throw me off the ship.

301
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:53,130
The person just rolled off. That's a cool skin or whatever it is. What kind of animal is that?

302
01:01:53,769 --> 01:02:09,380
I want to see. All right. As long as blue doesn't win, we're good. Ori and the Blind Forest. Oh,

303
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:24,199
okay. That's cool. I want to pick these up. How do you pick up the things on the ground?

304
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:35,380
What are you doing? I made one mistake and you're going to eliminate me twice?

305
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:41,579
What the hell? I tased you once and you're going to throw me off the ship two times?

306
01:02:44,699 --> 01:03:06,599
Come on, man. Bro is holding a grudge. Yeah. Well, I still, I want you to win because I get the win

307
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:20,900
too. Oh, he hates you. He does. He hates me. I'm going to stay away from him. I'm going to,

308
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,579
I can stay on the other side of the map because he sees the hammerhead and he's like,

309
01:03:24,579 --> 01:04:03,510
I'm going to kill that guy. Good backflip. Give me, give me. Oops. Sorry. That was kind of loud.

310
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:12,949
No, no, no, no. Get away. Get away. Get away. Get away. See ya. All right. I got,

311
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:24,599
I got to clutch this up right now. What are you doing? Oh my God. I freaked out. What I,

312
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:34,059
I didn't. Okay. Let me explain. Let me explain. Everyone listened for one second. I thought the

313
01:04:34,059 --> 01:04:44,469
ship was two or three. I thought it was longer. No, I want to get up there and get my picture

314
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:54,059
taken. You're so bad. I thought the ship was a little bit longer. I was, that guy freaked me

315
01:04:54,059 --> 01:05:01,219
out. I thought he was coming to get me. We still win. That's all right. It's a win. He looked like

316
01:05:01,219 --> 01:05:16,889
a mole rat. Why did you move? I don't know. What famous animal would you add to this game? An

317
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:32,900
armadillo? It might even be in the game already. Oh, what is this one? Carry candies back. Oh,

318
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:42,579
okay. Carry candies back to base to earn points. I'm going just straight up defense. Octopus.

319
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:50,630
Octopus will be cool. Squid. Octopus. Is there a whale? Is there like a lobster or crab or

320
01:05:50,630 --> 01:06:03,530
something? That'd be a great addition. Play Counter-Strike 2 in your off time. It's a great

321
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:13,739
game. It's really fun. I remember playing the original Counter-Strike 1.6. I was terrible at

322
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:23,289
it, but I played it. I tried CSGO. There's a video on my YouTube channel where I talk about

323
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:28,010
like, oh yeah, man, going to be playing a lot of CSGO. I think I played it one time and never played

324
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:33,000
it ever again. And I think there's a video of me playing it. And it's like, oh yeah, like it's a

325
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,699
big deal. And I just, I just, it just wasn't for me at all. People are, people are too good at that

326
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:52,019
game. Where's our base? Where do we turn this in? Oh, right here. You can't fall down that, can you?

327
01:06:52,579 --> 01:07:19,460
I'm going to start just transferring. Give me that. All right. Deposit those and we'll win.

328
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:55,050
Did I help? Am I dead? Dead? Am I dead? Dead? I'm here. I'm good. Nice job. Duck. All right.

329
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:04,019
We're doing all right. No shit. I'm sorry. Make sure you bring them all back. Come on,

330
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:18,970
we got to work together. Get with that shit. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

331
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:23,340
Just take it back. Take it back. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Go, go, go, go,

332
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:37,500
up, up, up, up, up. We got it. We got it. We got it. Where are you going? Where are you going?

333
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,380
Where are they going with that? I just stomped all over that guy's face.

334
01:08:48,579 --> 01:08:59,000
Don't let him drop it. Don't let him. Close this shit. No, don't open it again. Close it. Did I

335
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:19,000
close it or did I open it? Give me this. Give me this. I'm going to drop you into the fucking

336
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:36,199
freezer. Damn it. We can hear you mashing buttons. You can hear me like gripping the controller.

337
01:09:46,819 --> 01:10:10,649
Shit. This game is fun. I like it. Don't eat the controller. It's going to hurt to poop.

338
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:26,789
What about Dark and Darker? Um, not in the immediate future. What about football? What

339
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:37,479
is it? Stay away from the poison cloud and stay alive. Uh, I get it. Browser games? We'll do

340
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:43,430
browser games the next time I stream. Or maybe I'll play the Resident Evil DLC. That sounds fun

341
01:10:43,430 --> 01:11:08,789
too. Resident Evil 4? I also have to finish Sorcery. He's just going to play Binding of Isaac

342
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:30,340
for four hours. Waste. All right. Stay out of the poison. I have a new strategy. It's called just

343
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:49,590
stay on the ground. It's playing dead. Nobody pays attention really. This is where I get up and

344
01:11:49,590 --> 01:12:07,109
throw you. I'm going to throw you in. Oh, nevermind. God damn it. How do I get out of here? Oh shit.

345
01:12:17,779 --> 01:12:26,920
All right. I had a choice. I knew that was going to blow up in half a second. I was trying to

346
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,840
throw it at somebody. Just, you got to try. You have to go for it. Otherwise I would have blown

347
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:48,779
right back. Yeah, but why? Okay. I was climbing up here and there were three bombs here. I climbed

348
01:12:48,779 --> 01:13:05,180
up here. Boom. Blinking red. At some point you have to just go for it. Your teammate is so good.

349
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:14,569
Yeah. They're so good. In fact, that I'm on the menu too. As long as we win, I'll take the three

350
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:40,789
eggs. Whatever. Oh, I think we actually, no he's dead. Oh, it gets closer. Oh, he shot him in the

351
01:13:40,789 --> 01:14:01,939
head. What the fuck? That guy, he's done that to me twice. Thank you so much. Damn it. I want those

352
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:23,819
nunchucks. Why is this guy glowing? I don't know how to fix this. How do I fix this? Oh, okay.

353
01:14:23,819 --> 01:14:42,869
Give me. Hold it the right way. Oh shit. Sorry. I'm sorry. I did not mean to hit you in the head

354
01:14:42,869 --> 01:15:00,739
with that, but it just happened. Second, I get a melee weapon. It's over for everybody. I'm trying

355
01:15:00,739 --> 01:15:43,930
to plant this on somebody. Damn it. Hold it the right way. No. Oh, come on. Fuck. Dude, Miku has

356
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:49,930
been waiting for birthday wishes for you from a month. I said, happy birthday, Miku. You just

357
01:15:49,930 --> 01:16:13,909
weren't here. I said it. Yes, I did. Oh my God. This guy's going to kill me. You can't see who

358
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:27,220
did that, right? This person has no idea I did that. I should save the coins. Do they carry over?

359
01:16:30,409 --> 01:17:02,380
I imagine probably so. I'm going right for the boomerang. I need to get away from everybody.

360
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:24,810
Damn it. Watch out, please. You hit, hit. I have to get away from the guy with the frying pan.

361
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:32,819
That was a risky move, but you know what? Fuck it. I'm in the face of the fucking cinder block.

362
01:17:36,699 --> 01:18:15,189
Who is dude? What? Watch out. Uh, we need some, we need some more teamwork.

363
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:30,659
Just give it to me. Don't. This is such a bad place to be. Why am I still on the ground?

364
01:18:53,750 --> 01:19:23,560
I screamed a lot today. They call me. Okay. Get the brick. Did I not? I didn't. How did I not

365
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:57,050
hit you with the brick? I dropped on his head. I got him. He's not getting up for a long time.

366
01:19:57,050 --> 01:20:14,310
Oh, thank goodness. We're all hurt. This guy just won't leave me alone. No. What? Wait,

367
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:31,720
what just happened? Oh, the gas was everywhere. Come on. We got to get in the picture together.

368
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:57,270
Right when the picture gets taken. Can't wait for Hylics 2. How long is Hylics 2?

369
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:16,420
Because I know Hylics 1 was four, five hours? Three, four? It's like five to 10. There's a

370
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:26,380
lot of game modes. What is wind tunnel? Eh, we'll do this one. Beat the hockey into opponent's

371
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:45,539
gate to earn points. Beat the hockey into opponent's gate. Trevor, can you do another

372
01:21:45,539 --> 01:21:51,750
sponsored stream? Oh, all right. Okay. I mean, that's a request. That's a request. Somebody

373
01:21:51,750 --> 01:22:11,539
just requested one. One guy, one guy moment. You know what I mean? Nobody said. Nobody said

374
01:22:11,539 --> 01:22:28,409
you make me sick. Oh, settle down. Industry plant. All right. So we have to score goals.

375
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:44,899
Oh, it's this thing. It's a huge puck. We're not going to score on our own goal, right?

376
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:54,649
It's a whole, there's a whole team of gorillas. Oh, no, it's not.

377
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:22,439
Dude, I want to, I want to watch this version of hockey. Oh, I'm on your team. Give me this thing.

378
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:48,579
I got it. I got it. I'm just going to play defense. He's just holding his arm out and

379
01:23:48,579 --> 01:23:59,420
has his palm on the top of my head and I am swinging while he holds me back. We just get a

380
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:17,420
goal. Okay, let's go. All right. We got to be aggressive now. Aggressive, aggressive, aggressive.

381
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:37,289
Good, good, good, good, good, good. One more. There it is. Nice job. That was the most tired

382
01:24:37,289 --> 01:25:01,619
let's go ever. Let's go. This thing probably pushes it pretty far, right? I'm going to play

383
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:12,439
goalie. I actually think that's a smart use of my time right now. All right, get it out of here.

384
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:32,039
Yeah, this is offsides. You're going to get a fucking red card. Where am I? Yeah, try getting

385
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:54,020
it by me. Oh shit. Don't please. Okay. And the goalie is coming out of his goal and he's going

386
01:25:54,020 --> 01:26:00,939
all the way down. We've never seen anything like this before in giant puck ice hockey.

387
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:33,829
I helped. Defense. Let me handle this. Had my shield. Oh, deflected. Parried. Oh, parried again.

388
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:55,720
Come on. You're just, I mean, you're getting parried. You guys got it. Stay forward. Face forward.

389
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:18,550
Get out of here. Oh my god. That, my head spun 360 degrees. Oh, that's sad. Look at where I was.

390
01:27:18,869 --> 01:27:39,289
This game is fun. All right. You want to fight? I'll give you a fight. I blocked it with my body

391
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:51,609
and my face and my head and my brain and the concussion that I now have. I don't know. It

392
01:27:51,609 --> 01:28:09,210
looks so good. I just got up from a concussion, dude. Really? Unsportsmanlike conduct. Got it.

393
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:33,300
They're dinosaurs. That's cool. If you come over here, I am going to make your life a living hell.

394
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:49,859
Nice. Tell the Oreo puke story. Okay. When I was

395
01:28:53,340 --> 01:29:36,649
college, what did I just do? There's a puck. This is my chance. It's my chance. No, we can do it.

396
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:46,489
Come on. Stay in the back a little. If it flies back here, I'm going to be ready to get it.

397
01:29:46,489 --> 01:30:21,989
Everybody just stay on the goal. I just have to body block. Oh, this is so embarrassing.

398
01:30:22,069 --> 01:30:34,630
This is really embarrassing. It's like I took an extra five seconds to know I was still playing

399
01:30:34,630 --> 01:31:03,560
the game. Oh my God. Get out of here. Oh shit. Oh shit. You stood there like a kid in the little

400
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:25,140
league. Yeah. Come on. It's right there. We won. Wasn't it a tie? Oh no, we did win.

401
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:48,739
I just want to get in front of this guy and ruin the picture. Your character looks like you.

402
01:31:49,300 --> 01:32:13,260
I don't think. What do you mean? Explain. Explain. He does. Explain. It's the eyes.

403
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:34,920
You guys think my eyes are that far apart? My eyes are not that far apart. Your eyes are close

404
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:54,420
together. I think my eyes are very normal distance. We should compare. Looks like we struck

405
01:32:54,420 --> 01:33:02,420
a nerve. I don't care. I don't like, I don't fucking care at all. It's just annoying. I don't

406
01:33:02,899 --> 01:33:08,500
give a shit. I don't care. I don't give a fuck about that. I don't know. It's annoying to me.

407
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:25,380
I don't care though. What are you talking about? I think I'm good right here. Nice try. No,

408
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:35,130
no, you're not going to get me off it. I'll pull it this way. I don't care as long as I'm behind

409
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:55,850
the wind. Dude, everybody just stop grabbing at it. Oh, I'm going to fuck this up so bad.

410
01:33:56,729 --> 01:34:23,640
Oh, actually not bad. Oh, well, sacrifice yourself. Blue team wins, right? You need to

411
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:38,489
do a bunch of wind compensation there. Is somebody else alive? No. Dude, I'm on your team.

412
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:53,689
Get up. We've got to pull, all right, we have to pull a lever. Somebody, we're all going to go,

413
01:34:53,689 --> 01:35:17,560
we're all going to die. That's what I want. I want chaos. Hit him instead. Oh fuck. All right,

414
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:41,140
that's really strong. Yeah, go the long way. Everybody comes over to me. You're getting shot.

415
01:35:48,760 --> 01:36:12,279
Oh fuck. I need to live too. Oh shit. No. Oh shit. It's two v one. This is not good. Oh,

416
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:36,199
oh, I got him. Can you not climb this? What's going on here? Why are you not doing this?

417
01:36:38,439 --> 01:37:00,979
Climb up this. Why can't I? Why couldn't I climb? He had to go around. It was convex. Oh shit.

418
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:23,180
Stick out by my guys up there. Take somebody off from red because they're going to sacrifice

419
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:38,060
themselves. This is very, very low. Is he going to get blown off? What's going on with this guy?

420
01:37:38,060 --> 01:38:08,739
Trying to get the head butt in. All right, the goal is to stay all the way to the left.

421
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:33,670
Everyone's going to just, as we need stuff up now, hold on. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't

422
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:57,779
let go. I'm holding the thing down. At least the wind's not here. Fine, fine, fine. Take that one.

423
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:15,220
I don't care. We can all have one. Let me know. This is how we survive. What the fuck? I was

424
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:34,390
what? What was that? Well, I got annihilated. What was that all about? No, don't. No, don't. Please.

425
01:39:52,390 --> 01:40:27,270
I got it. Don't worry. All right. Good luck. All right. Lower profile. And him. Oh man,

426
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:39,369
that was pretty good. That's fine, I don't care. Just stuff over here. Oh, don't ever jump here.

427
01:40:39,369 --> 01:41:05,479
Ever. Oh my. God damn it. Bring back grandpa. Hey, it's me. Grandpa. Okay, bye. Hey, oh,

428
01:41:05,479 --> 01:41:22,100
Grant, you just missed him. You didn't even get a crown. I got a crown my first game,

429
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:36,140
and the second game, and the third game. Are you playing against bots? No, it's a streamer

430
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:44,920
zone. I just saw it was a thing I could click, and I said, if they have it, something to enable,

431
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:49,239
there's a reason why they want you to enable it. That's my philosophy on the whole thing.

432
01:41:50,310 --> 01:42:27,560
Oh, everybody loves this one. These are bots. I need to get some new skins. You should roll for

433
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:39,159
10 skins. You have to get a high enough MMR to matchmake. Oh, is that for real? I kind of feel

434
01:42:39,399 --> 01:43:27,859
like I've been talking shit this whole time. Nice try. Oh, double tap. Oh, triple. No, you don't.

435
01:43:27,859 --> 01:43:41,590
It's just 2v2. We got it. Come on, duck. You just pushed me off. You dope. You dope. You jumped off.

436
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:49,079
Well, I jumped, but then he gave me the extra momentum to fly off. I would have landed perfectly

437
01:43:49,079 --> 01:44:17,529
fine. I'm perfectly safe. Okay, come on. Does this thing hurt, or is it just bounce? Yeah,

438
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:31,739
I think it's just a bouncer. Swing at him. Why am I not swinging it anymore?

439
01:44:43,189 --> 01:45:03,350
Oh, that's my friend. Sorry. No. Oh, shit. That hurt. I'm using an inflatable toy.

440
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:26,890
Good start. I tried to save him. Don't even think about it. Was that a hat? Oh, it's a banana.

441
01:45:45,340 --> 01:46:03,079
Get that bomb away from me. Oh my god. I have the weapon, and I'm scared. No, give me back. Give

442
01:46:03,079 --> 01:46:32,489
me the weapon back. Yeah. I'm just not capable of doing that advanced technique, and I just tried.

443
01:46:32,489 --> 01:46:38,619
I went for the advanced technique. It was just immediately run, jump, kick, and it was a problem.

444
01:46:48,409 --> 01:47:19,850
Why is Yoshi driving? I don't know. Yoshi, you can do it. I know you can. You have super power.

445
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:33,560
Don't do the dive jump. It's bad. Not a good idea right now. Good. Finish it off. Finish it.

446
01:47:33,560 --> 01:48:04,550
Good finish. Nice work. God damn it. Don't shoot me. Okay, I'm good. Get away from me.

447
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:10,649
Oh, he's got me with the plunger. No, I'm plunged right now.

448
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:38,140
Where is it? What the fuck was that? What was I doing? The fact that he was pulling his arms

449
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:48,899
behind his back trying to... Oh, that was cartoonish. That was fucking wedged.

450
01:48:49,619 --> 01:48:58,380
Jeez. Okay, as long as green doesn't win, we're good. I don't even know who... I don't know who won.

451
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:16,220
They both fell off at the same time. That was fun. All right, now I'm gonna get some skins.

452
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:44,069
I'm like whispering a secret to him. Where'd they get... That's a pumpkin head. That's kind of cool.

453
01:49:44,069 --> 01:49:57,289
All right, let me go back and do some... Let's see. 1,500 cookies and some money. I got 200 bucks.

454
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:05,050
All right, what can I do? This one's 22,000. 12,000. This is what people are spending their

455
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:36,439
money on, I guess. Okay, yeah, that's cool. I like blue. Should I do it with money? Why not, right?

456
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:52,760
And I got blue. I wanted blue and now I have blue blue. Nice. Do I need to have blue to do blue blue?

457
01:50:53,479 --> 01:51:09,619
You should roll for 10. Do you have to buy the money? No, okay. Let's do it. I'm gonna do one

458
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:16,060
more and then I'm gonna go take a quick break and come back and do this one. You get money on level

459
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:48,180
ups, yeah. Is he tired already? No, I'm lounging. Show the beanbag chair. Uh, you will see it

460
01:51:48,180 --> 01:52:02,520
eventually. This is the one that we have not seen. You should wear a giant yellow raincoat on stream.

461
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:36,010
Intriguing. Cool. All right, Lulu. And get a big yellow hat and adopt a monkey. What did the man

462
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:47,979
in the yellow hat do for a living? What did he do? He's an archaeologist. He was a researcher.

463
01:52:47,979 --> 01:53:00,229
He was a zookeeper. I was like, what a fit that is. A long brimmed yellow hat and just a yellow

464
01:53:00,949 --> 01:53:13,850
jacket, yellow pants. That is an awesome look. Then you showed up to work and your boss was in the

465
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:25,899
the man, the curious George dad fit. He'd be like, holy shit, I really hate to do this. I'm really

466
01:53:25,899 --> 01:53:32,550
sorry. What just happened? What just happened to my head? What did he just do? Did I just hit my

467
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:53,319
head on his head? What just happened? Yes, come on. Oh, I would say I deserved it, but it's a free

468
01:53:53,319 --> 01:54:08,890
for, no it's not. What hit me? The gorilla is popular. Look at this. I kind of want the gorilla

469
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:30,180
now. I feel like my gaming skill would increase by at least 25% if I was the gorilla. Got him on

470
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:58,649
the backswing. Oh, my team, I'm on green. Okay. Hi, I want you to win. You can do it. Did I help?

471
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:25,930
I'm not sure. You can do it. Let them fight each other. Ooh, big punch. Almost got it. Watch out

472
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:34,229
behind you though. I'm not in a discord with anybody, but they can't hear me. Seems to lose, right?

473
01:55:35,029 --> 01:56:19,000
Did we win? Okay, good. I want to stick this on somebody. Come here. Got you. Okay, let go. Shit.

474
01:56:29,659 --> 01:56:43,930
Okay, come here. I threw him far too. Good. I punched him in the face. In your arms. Nice work.

475
01:56:44,010 --> 01:57:34,500
Come on, get up. Dude, you overshoot it every time. Fuck you. Oh, that's bad. Actually kind of good. Come

476
01:57:34,500 --> 01:58:05,260
on. Shoot. All right, two gorillas. One with a nunchuck. Who wins? He just knocked himself out

477
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:25,350
with a nunchuck. That'd be so funny if he lost. Pretty even. You're AFK. I'm going to help you here.

478
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:45,270
See? I didn't kill you. You're AFK. Remember that for when you try to get me. How is it going through

479
01:58:45,270 --> 01:59:08,170
the gap between their two heads? That's what I want to know. Oh, don't even think about it. Shit.

480
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:19,779
The poor cat is over there, still lying down. I need to rescue the cat. I'm rescuing the cat.

481
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:33,720
I think it's too late. Oh, come on. The cat. The cat's going down. Cat's going down.

482
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:51,420
Iceberg melting. Oh, I feel bad. That was my fault. I'm going to get up first and we're going to win.

483
01:59:57,289 --> 02:00:08,060
Get. Come on. What? Oh, give me a break. I was grabbing onto the ledge and then my left arm

484
02:00:08,060 --> 02:00:14,300
grabbed onto his head and then pushed his head down. I just saw blood and I just had to just

485
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:27,050
continue. No. Why didn't you climb up? Whatever. Oh, this is going to be fun. Oh, I was going to

486
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:40,460
try to have like 10 plungers in his head. I'm staying. No. I want to stay over here with the cat.

487
02:00:41,100 --> 02:01:44,569
Oh, shit. This is big for me. No. Excuse me. Get me the fuck away from that. Wait. You idiot.

488
02:01:44,569 --> 02:01:53,739
The two red team is still here. All right. I'm going to hang out for a second.

489
02:02:05,689 --> 02:02:29,000
Get away from me. I don't know what to do. Oh, conductivity. I forgot about conductivity.

490
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:49,380
Sorry, I'm still alive. Run. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why are you having so much trouble

491
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:58,220
getting up? Come on, dude. Get up. Do it. Get up. Why is he not getting up? Why is he not getting

492
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:10,359
up? Did I win? No stamina. Oh, I think we still won. All right. One more. This might be a win

493
02:03:10,359 --> 02:03:37,880
right here. I just knocked somebody out with my body weight. Jesus. What happened? What happened?

494
02:03:47,140 --> 02:04:05,619
Get out of here. Come on. Who wants to fuck around? Who wants to fuck around? Get that thing

495
02:04:05,619 --> 02:04:15,930
away from me. This is it. This is a win right here. If I get it, if I get it. I got it. I got

496
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:39,829
it. I got it. This is a win. This is a guaranteed win. I thought everybody was dead. I thought

497
02:04:39,829 --> 02:04:46,739
everybody was dead, but they were just on a different part of the map. That dude's probably

498
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:52,699
pissed. That's the first time that person's got that power up and they get hit with a coin.

499
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:09,000
Uh, okay. We're still in it as long as, uh, yeah, there's no green. Unfortunately,

500
02:05:12,649 --> 02:05:27,210
yellow can win. That's fine. Good. Blue winning here would be huge. So we're going to try to

501
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:39,689
put our thumb on the scale here. Nice job. You're green. Yeah. I don't want yellow to win.

502
02:05:42,699 --> 02:05:46,779
Okay. Oh, blue had one win too. Shit. All right. This is, this is it. This is the one here. Let

503
02:05:46,779 --> 02:05:59,300
me try as hard as I can. One, two, three, go. Yup. Wow. Oh, please tell me I eliminated five

504
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:23,689
people. We don't want blue to win. Blue or yellow has to lose. Where's my teammate? Do I have a

505
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:50,630
teammate? No, I need that pen. Oh my God. It hit me right in the face. It hit me right in the face.

506
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:58,539
That's so frustrating. You can do it. I know you can get up there. I'll be careful though.

507
02:06:59,579 --> 02:07:38,539
But, but, but, but get off me. Get off me. What did I just do? No, I had an opportunity,

508
02:07:38,539 --> 02:08:01,899
but I missed it. Holy shit. Whoever did that, you just saved everything. Shit. No, right to him.

509
02:08:03,130 --> 02:08:10,619
Don't. Oh my God. Why is he so super powered? Why does this guy have super powers? How do you get,

510
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:21,609
how do you get the super power? You have to eat a biscuit or a drink. Oh,

511
02:08:27,079 --> 02:08:35,930
damn it. Did I even have a teammate? I feel like I didn't have a teammate that whole time.

512
02:08:47,609 --> 02:09:02,890
There's a whole gorillas. You killed him with the bomb. Oh, that seems to be a theme.

513
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:08,500
Where's my teammate? What happened? Oh, you killed him in the first five seconds. Oh, right.

514
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:17,750
Makes sense. Right. Sure. He was AFK the whole time. I think we did pretty good for AFK teammate.

515
02:09:23,449 --> 02:09:50,859
Can we bully Jerma? No, but you lighten up a little bit. Bullies you. Stop. It's not his

516
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:56,500
birthday anymore. We don't have to be nice to him. It's my birthday month. Hey, if Grimace gets to do

517
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:39,750
that, I do too. You gotta follow the same rules. Where's your weird milkshake? All right. This is

518
02:10:39,750 --> 02:11:06,949
a goofy one. Is it lit? Oh, that's not good. Saved by the bomb. What do I do with it? There was no

519
02:11:06,949 --> 02:11:32,649
way to put it. All right. Good job, blue team. No, it's my bomb. Oh, I got him. I got him. He

520
02:11:32,649 --> 02:11:49,180
bailed on the bomb and it was the mistake. He bailed on the bomb. What the fuck? I'm all right.

521
02:11:49,180 --> 02:12:17,270
I got a hand on the, uh, on it. Oh, this is one of those laughing games. You know what I mean?

522
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:27,210
I kind of threw pretty hard right there. I'm not gonna lie. That was really dumb.

523
02:12:27,930 --> 02:12:40,760
I threw completely. I actually just, I just threw. Where's my teammate? Oh, there you go. Well,

524
02:12:41,399 --> 02:13:00,310
we'll get him next time. Right in the head. Oh, you're gonna get kicked from the clan for that

525
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:20,939
one. That's so rough when it does that. I get so impatient here because I just want to throw

526
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:48,020
rocks at him. I don't want to. The bomb is awesome, but anybody's game. Ouch. That was a

527
02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:59,850
really good throw too. Oh, unfortunate. That was a great throw. Perfect placement. All right. Let

528
02:13:59,850 --> 02:14:17,130
me see if I can drop bomb. Got it. I just threw it right there. Decent placement. Lots of damage

529
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:40,739
on blue. We don't want blue to win. No. Oh, that's too bad. That's if you can get this thing,

530
02:14:40,739 --> 02:14:53,380
it's game over. No, I need to buy the handle. No, no, nobody can use it. Shit. Come on.

531
02:14:54,340 --> 02:15:09,720
Your teammate's AFK, is he? Not like it really matters that much. You have five feet of space

532
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:26,550
next to you. People just ramming into each other anyways. Floating dead in the river right now.

533
02:15:28,789 --> 02:15:45,220
Nobody's won yet. We're doing all right. That, I didn't even see that. Am I the only one that

534
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:55,210
died from that? I'm the only person that died. Okay. Well, blue, I got it. This has got to be

535
02:15:55,210 --> 02:16:02,949
a good bomb here. Right there. Perfect. Oh, that's going to be great. Watch this.

536
02:16:04,069 --> 02:16:13,770
Oh, I thought they were going to get launched over to it. Blue cannot win. Come on, cat. You got it.

537
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:47,340
Nice throw. There we go. Don't be. Okay. You guys can do that all you want. Whoa. Wow.

538
02:16:47,500 --> 02:17:15,459
What happened to that guy? Hey, we did it. He hit himself. Oh, okay. Wait, I got to drink that,

539
02:17:15,459 --> 02:17:31,780
right? I plunged him. Watch out for that bomb. It's going to eliminate every single person.

540
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:46,549
This is going to be awesome. Nobody wants to pick it up. Dude, really? Really? Everyone's like

541
02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:50,469
running around the bomb. No, I would have picked it up. I would have been the first person to pick

542
02:17:50,469 --> 02:18:28,020
it up. Oh, red one. I need to win another one. Oh, game's addicting. Damn it. Okay. One more.

543
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:35,350
And then I'm going to actually go to the bathroom. Get blue death feigning beetles?

544
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:45,159
No, we want them. We just want to be in a position where we can take care of them.

545
02:18:45,799 --> 02:18:55,590
It's all like the traveling, lots of stuff going on. I would say probably like in the,

546
02:18:55,590 --> 02:19:01,219
in the new year, we'll probably get them. I want to make sure we can really,

547
02:19:01,219 --> 02:19:07,530
like truly pay attention to them. Everything. Oh, what is this? I've never seen this one.

548
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:29,510
Oh, let's play the new one. They're very easy to take care of. That's what we have heard. Hey,

549
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:41,049
they love grapes, right? I love grapes. It was just meant to be. Did you get a pet lobster?

550
02:19:43,639 --> 02:19:53,049
That's cool. I love fish. I love aquatic life. I love marine life, but I don't, taking care of

551
02:19:53,049 --> 02:19:59,659
aquatic life. There's a lot of maintenance, like cleaning the tank and making sure that the

552
02:19:59,659 --> 02:20:10,819
levels are good, right? Like you can't just like, oh, there's my lobster. I mean, I've heard it's

553
02:20:10,819 --> 02:20:19,159
very fulfilling and it's really cool to have like a bunch of fish in a fish tank or lobsters or

554
02:20:19,159 --> 02:20:47,239
crabs or whatever people do. I'm going to score my first goal ever. Hey, why are you so mean to me?

555
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:33,190
That's the inside of that. How are you that good to be able to do that? Also the play is probably

556
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:57,000
just a standstill while everybody just runs into each other. There you go. Nice. Are you excited

557
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:03,030
for the FNAF movie? Yeah, I'll watch that one on times four speed instead of times six speed.

558
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:25,180
So yeah, I mean, I'm very, I'm going to tell him very excited for it. What's Saw X? Yeah, I don't,

559
02:22:25,180 --> 02:22:41,430
I want to see Saw X, but I don't want to go to the theater to see Saw X. Although they're making

560
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:53,639
this one a big deal. This one's a big deal. And we all know how much of a fan I am of the

561
02:22:53,639 --> 02:23:12,120
Saw movies. Although I can't say I remember what happened between five and 10. Oh my God. I, wow.

562
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:24,899
I jumped in the air and he hit me right in the chin. Come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go. It's

563
02:23:24,899 --> 02:23:49,030
right there. Stop him from doing this. How did we not stop him from doing that? Marathon them.

564
02:23:59,899 --> 02:24:05,340
I still do want to do that thing I talked about. It might just, it might just be a video. I think

565
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:19,879
it's funnier as a video. Yeah. So watch along. Wait, did I, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's

566
02:24:19,879 --> 02:24:24,200
happened? I forgot what, I forgot what team I was on. Am I going, is this correct? Is this bad?

567
02:24:45,860 --> 02:25:03,850
That got everybody. That wiped out the whole crew. Oh my. This has been a big talking stream,

568
02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:12,579
more than a gaming stream. It can be both. But a game like this is pretty much just kind of goofy

569
02:25:12,579 --> 02:25:33,129
and fun to sit here and play it. Pulling his hair. Oh shit. I forgot I was going to go. All

570
02:25:33,129 --> 02:25:40,200
right. One more. How's the mystery video? Well, there are two videos that I want to do. The one

571
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:48,940
I was just talking about. And then this one, the mystery one. I'm only making the mystery video

572
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:55,860
for me. It's not for anybody else. So when you see this, just, it was not, I didn't make it for

573
02:25:55,860 --> 02:26:14,329
anybody else, but it could get 10 views and I wouldn't even care. Everyone wants to play them.

574
02:26:14,329 --> 02:26:23,129
I'm bad at these ones. I don't like these ones. Okay. I won't watch it. That's all right. It

575
02:26:23,129 --> 02:26:28,709
actually is fine because the video is not going to be any good. This video is going to overstay its

576
02:26:28,709 --> 02:26:35,780
welcome in the first 30 seconds. And it's going to be like a seven minute video or more. It could

577
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:59,319
be longer. I don't know. I am actually going to play goalie this time. All right. Good, good,

578
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:11,510
good. Go. Nice. Somebody else is playing goalie. Watch this. I'm going to go fuck this guy up.

579
02:27:16,709 --> 02:27:39,829
Yeah. I'm talking to you. What the fuck? I see. I'm distracting him. This is bad for him.

580
02:27:40,469 --> 02:27:52,229
All right. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. All right. All right. I'm done.

581
02:27:52,950 --> 02:28:10,010
I'm a good spot right here. Give me a spot right now. Watch this. I got a line right to the goal.

582
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:26,500
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Here we go. Three, two, one. Dude, get it out of here.

583
02:28:27,059 --> 02:29:10,729
Okay. We're good. What'd you say? Get over there. Oh, I get credit for that one. I do.

584
02:29:10,729 --> 02:29:28,069
I get credit for that one. Perfect bounce. I like that little guy. He's funny. The shark. Yeah.

585
02:29:28,069 --> 02:29:54,360
I'm going to be the last one to get up. I would have been there, but I was so late to get up. Hey,

586
02:29:54,360 --> 02:30:02,059
good night, Jerma. You should have played fall guys instead. I don't want to play fall guys.

587
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:37,940
I want to play party animals. I'm getting in the goal. This is dangerous. Imagine seeing a goalie

588
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:53,899
come out and do that. The other team scores on their goal. Oh, he's not on the goal. He's not

589
02:30:54,700 --> 02:31:08,420
on the goal. Uh-oh. Not on the goal. Hey, hey, hey, bro, bro. Get your head in the game.

590
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:30,620
Who else wasn't in the goal? Yeah, but I belly to belly suplex that guy. It's worth something.

591
02:31:41,239 --> 02:32:00,860
That cat's eyes. Holy shit. That cat. That cat like hot boxed his room for an hour. All right.

592
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:09,260
I'll be right back. Just going to get another, get some water. Use the bathroom. Back in two

593
02:32:09,260 --> 02:36:10,620
minutes. Three minutes. I am back. I want to do something. Check this out. Ready? Turn the game

594
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:31,319
down. Have you guys ever done this before? The brainstorm or green needle viral video? Somebody

595
02:36:31,319 --> 02:36:48,940
have. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. It's really, it's weird. Okay. So there's this toy that when you

596
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:58,920
press a button on it, it plays an audio file and the audio file that it plays, it goes brainstorm,

597
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:06,729
brainstorm, but you can make your brain. You can make you, you can make yourself hear something

598
02:37:06,729 --> 02:37:11,579
else. Let's do the experiment. It's been like five years. Hey, I just found it. So whatever.

599
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:33,690
I'm 40 and I'm retired. Okay. We find things a little later. I want to do it, uh, brainstorm

600
02:37:33,690 --> 02:37:44,069
because sometimes it'll say both at the same time and it's freaky. All right, here we go. Ready?

601
02:37:44,069 --> 02:38:13,500
What do you hear? Do you hear brainstorm or do you hear green needle? Brainstorm.

602
02:38:17,219 --> 02:38:35,079
Brainstorm. Right? Brainstorm. Okay. Green needle. Green needle. Green needle. Brainstorm.

603
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:44,620
Who the fuck is hearing green needle? It's going to happen. You know, that image of,

604
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:48,940
I think it's like a spinning ballerina that if you watch it long enough, it spins the other

605
02:38:48,940 --> 02:39:05,399
way. It's like that. Just give it a second. Green needle. Buzzfeed Andy. Green needle.

606
02:39:09,399 --> 02:39:27,909
Isn't that cool? Isn't that interesting? Isn't that cool? I heard radio static. Huh? Getting

607
02:39:27,909 --> 02:39:37,020
real 78 year old grandmothers showing something on the computer vibes. Do Yanny and, oh yeah,

608
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:52,790
this one too. Let's try this one. All right. What do you hear on this one? What do you hear?

609
02:39:52,950 --> 02:40:03,209
Mary. Laurel. Mary. Laurel. Mary. Mary. It's hard for me to get it to do the other one.

610
02:40:04,600 --> 02:40:07,559
Mary. Mary. Cause it goes like,

611
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:18,180
I can't get it to say, I can't get it to say Yanny.

612
02:40:19,209 --> 02:40:30,659
Mary. Yanny. No, I can't get it to do Yanny now. Mary. Mary. Shit. Mary. It's Laurel only.

613
02:40:30,979 --> 02:40:42,340
Mary. Say, say. Mary. Yanny. Mary. Shit. Mary. Mary. Okay. So the parts, the, the kind of the,

614
02:40:42,340 --> 02:40:55,100
the like the vibrato of the, the voice, it's like, it goes like Yanny. Yanny. But I can't get

615
02:40:55,100 --> 02:41:12,250
him to do it now. Mary. Mary. Shit. Mary. Mary. Mary. Damn it. Mary. Mary. Yeah. Sometimes it

616
02:41:12,250 --> 02:41:30,870
goes Laurel. Yanny. Yanny. Mary. I can't get him to do it now. All right. What do you, uh,

617
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:39,540
there's a couple more interesting ones too. Mary. I can't get them to do it. Mary. I'm

618
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:48,459
gonna try it one more time. Yanny. Say it. Mary. Mary. Mary. There's a couple more cool ones.

619
02:41:50,780 --> 02:42:02,680
Let's try this one. All right. Do you hear this one? This one tripped me up big time. Do you hear

620
02:42:03,399 --> 02:42:10,540
a burp or a fart? Which one? It's, it's hard for me to find, to decipher it. What do you guys hear?

621
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:41,659
What'd you hear? See, I can't get it to burp now. No, still. What are you guys hearing? You hear

622
02:42:41,659 --> 02:42:49,219
both? Let me try it one more time. So I'm saying if you slow them down, you can hear different

623
02:42:49,219 --> 02:43:10,969
things. Really? Hey, I, uh, like I'm, I'm hearing Laurel. That's interesting. I hear brainstorm

624
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:22,940
minus 3 million. Well, unfortunately you can't take that many points away. There's only a hundred

625
02:43:22,940 --> 02:43:35,299
points. So I still get an F. You could have said you minus 50 points and I still get an F. Dude,

626
02:43:35,299 --> 02:43:57,239
you're embarrassing me. All right, let's keep playing this one. Yanny. Yanny. Yanny. Okay.

627
02:43:57,239 --> 02:44:00,680
If you take what I just did and mess with it, can you make it say Laurel? That's what I'm,

628
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:22,420
that's my question. Is it going to haunt me in my sleep? Um, just like,

629
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:38,010
like a couple of blueberries. It'd be all right. All righty. Let's do it. Did I get any new stuff?

630
02:44:38,569 --> 02:45:01,059
Did I get any new things? Refreshes in three days. Oh, is it a burp or a fart? It's so funny.

631
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:30,360
Kind of with the cat. I'm buying the cat. Uh, hold on. I need to, this is, we're not,

632
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:37,000
we're not going anywhere. Somebody said this sounds like the DVD menu for the mask.

633
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:50,500
And we need, is it available to see if that's the, hold on a second. Oh, we, we stall a lot here.

634
02:45:50,500 --> 02:46:02,260
Sorry. I'm curious. The mask DVD menu. It's right. It is here. All right. So this is the,

635
02:46:02,260 --> 02:46:24,899
this is the mask DVD menu song. Okay. He's like spinning around. Okay. This is not even close.

636
02:46:30,940 --> 02:46:43,379
Wait, they were thinking Austin powers. Oh, were they thinking Austin powers?

637
02:46:43,379 --> 02:46:47,379
Oh, we have to, we have to ban that guy. Yeah. You gotta get, you gotta ban for at

638
02:46:47,379 --> 02:46:50,809
least a couple of days. I mean, I stream like once a week now, but like, you know,

639
02:46:50,809 --> 02:47:01,370
you're banned for a day. Austin. Yeah. This is just, this is kind of scary.

640
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:26,760
Austin powers DVD menu. Okay. I mean, not, I mean, not really. This is wrong too. What

641
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:50,920
does it sound like? No, not, not really. Well, wait a minute. Hold on. Wait. Unban that person.

642
02:47:50,920 --> 02:48:05,959
Unban that person. And I'll tell you why this is the mask, the animated series intro.

643
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:09,819
This is what they thought of.

644
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:33,350
Wow.

645
02:48:37,979 --> 02:48:39,420
Okay. Hold on.

646
02:48:42,709 --> 02:48:56,120
Yeah. I tried to save you. It's, it's the same genre of music. There's two or three of the same

647
02:48:56,120 --> 02:49:10,420
instruments. What about, hold on. No, I can't. I'm sorry. I can't save you, but you know,

648
02:49:10,420 --> 02:49:19,190
what's cool though. I, it could be, it really could be, this could be the mask DVD menu.

649
02:49:19,190 --> 02:49:23,850
You could have convinced everybody. In fact, I, it should be all right. What's going on? Oh,

650
02:49:23,850 --> 02:49:43,020
I'm in an activity. Change outfit. Ah, wait. Surprise egg. Do I have enough? No. All right.

651
02:49:43,020 --> 02:50:05,690
Let's play. Olive garden music. I remember that. That was great. That was a really fun night.

652
02:50:14,620 --> 02:50:36,739
Jackbox. It could be jackbox. All right. I want to play this one. No, no one wants to play the

653
02:50:36,739 --> 02:50:56,020
safe back to base to earn points. All right, let's go. So to grab onto it. Have you ever

654
02:50:56,020 --> 02:51:05,559
done a jackbox stream? Oh yeah. Lots of times. Lots of times. Oh, let's see if my mouse is

655
02:51:05,559 --> 02:51:17,459
moving. Okay. It's been a very long time. I think the reason why I don't do jackbox streams anymore

656
02:51:17,459 --> 02:51:25,909
is because, uh, all the answers. Oh, okay. Everybody. So what do you think is the answer?

657
02:51:26,709 --> 02:51:34,229
Is it German? Nine, eight, five. Jerma sucks. Jerma pooped his pants or Jerma sucks.

658
02:51:34,870 --> 02:51:43,930
Which one of those is it? I was just like, well, these are all kind of the same answer.

659
02:51:44,010 --> 02:51:54,180
Aren't they somehow? Who am I holding onto? I'm sorry. I apologize. Can I apologize?

660
02:51:54,899 --> 02:52:27,590
I apologize to that person. Hey. All right. I've, I've had you in chokehold. I don't know who has

661
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:36,059
who here. He's stuffing me into a locker. I can't get out of here. What the hell?

662
02:52:37,020 --> 02:53:31,350
Get off me. Just start bite, bite his neck. Bite him. Not right here. Shit. Yeah. Got him.

663
02:53:31,989 --> 02:53:49,079
Let's make this way easier for us. Uh, I have, I don't know what, how this one works. This thing

664
02:53:49,079 --> 02:53:57,270
floats around and we have to like put it over here. We got it. All right. Press the button.

665
02:53:58,069 --> 02:54:44,569
I think we got it. Yeah, we do. There we go. We need to get the actual thing. Oh,

666
02:54:44,569 --> 02:54:49,959
everyone's holding onto it. All right. Where we need to bring it. Where? I don't really know

667
02:54:49,959 --> 02:55:12,569
what's happening, but we're having fun. We just got it again. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got

668
02:55:12,569 --> 02:55:27,799
it. I got it. I got it right there. Right there. No. Knock it up. The first victory in an hour

669
02:55:27,799 --> 02:56:07,659
and a half. That was a really bad picture. It's beautiful. Is it? It's September 27th already.

670
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:29,530
I blinked and we went from May to September. Icebreaker is a lot of fun. It's probably one

671
02:56:29,530 --> 02:56:56,860
of the best maps. Retirement does too. I'm very active. I have 0.99. I wanna do that. When's the

672
02:56:56,860 --> 02:57:00,889
update? Isn't there a big update coming really soon? Because I'll definitely play it when the

673
02:57:00,889 --> 02:57:23,319
update comes out. Somewhere in October, right? Yes, I did try to punch my teammate and yes,

674
02:57:23,319 --> 02:57:34,899
I'm sorry about it. Okay, okay, okay. You heard me. I went Super Saiyan. Am I actually gonna fall

675
02:57:34,899 --> 02:57:51,399
down here at Super Saiyan? I'm gonna ruin this for everybody. This is gonna be great. Let's do this.

676
02:58:00,780 --> 02:58:08,040
That should count for a win for me. I should get points for that. I should get every point for that

677
02:58:08,040 --> 02:58:28,549
one. Oh, that was great. I'm so sorry, but you definitely lost. Why are we all on one of them?

678
02:58:29,110 --> 02:58:31,750
There's more than one. Oh boy, that's not good.

679
02:58:51,430 --> 02:59:00,940
Come on, what the hell? It's like he did that for dramatic effect. All right, let's see.

680
02:59:05,510 --> 02:59:14,739
Yeah, see you later. I'm gonna put it right in the middle. Oh, that's bad for you. That whatever

681
02:59:14,739 --> 02:59:33,100
the pig guy. The wind actually helped. You're terrible at this game. I know you are, but what

682
02:59:33,100 --> 02:59:52,170
am I? The pig is on my team. For some reason, I always just think I'm on green team. Just to

683
02:59:52,170 --> 03:00:29,020
be green. It's like, yeah, green versus red. I'm always on green team. That bunny is pissed

684
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:42,010
because of what I did last. You can hear the button pressing. Somebody turn it on. I got you.

685
03:00:43,340 --> 03:01:22,899
Don't let go. I'm still here. I'll stay over here. Fuck all of you. Hey, hey, you're weighing

686
03:01:22,899 --> 03:01:28,379
it down. He's weighing it down. He just weighed it down. He sat on top of the N64 cartridge and

687
03:01:28,379 --> 03:01:42,379
just went right in. All right, I gotta make something happen here. I'm just like hitting

688
03:01:42,379 --> 03:02:29,909
nothing. Oh, fuck. Oh, there's another one. Get up. Try to get away from the bomb. Headbutt with

689
03:02:29,909 --> 03:02:41,420
that glorious head of yours. I'm gonna wait for the win. Actually, you know what? Oh, never mind.

690
03:02:41,500 --> 03:03:02,549
Yellow team is the team to beat. Oh, he's gonna slurp down there. Yep. Oh, he didn't even know.

691
03:03:02,549 --> 03:03:25,659
He didn't even know. I have to hold on to my friend. Oh, shit. Big move right there. Okay,

692
03:03:25,659 --> 03:03:36,579
we win. We win. We win. We win. We win. We win. We win. No! I just hit him in the head with that.

693
03:03:39,459 --> 03:03:54,180
I'm so sorry. Are you still alive? You can do it, man. I know you can. You can do it.

694
03:03:59,370 --> 03:04:20,889
Where is he? Where is he? Where was he that whole time? My control is in my lap right now.

695
03:04:25,059 --> 03:04:37,819
Whatever. Good luck, everybody. Oh, that's not good for the person. No, that's my friend,

696
03:04:37,819 --> 03:05:01,879
but I gave him a bomb and he's gonna utilize it. Nice throw. All right, I have confidence in the

697
03:05:01,879 --> 03:05:17,979
dog. You got this. Nice job. Stay alive. I'm gonna wait for a bomb. My team is green.

698
03:05:18,620 --> 03:05:54,020
Unless they're... I might wait for the last one. Nah, let's do it now. You're okay.

699
03:05:59,420 --> 03:06:29,899
Jess gets his head electrocuted. That's not cool. That's not cool. He's gone. See, to me,

700
03:06:29,899 --> 03:06:34,760
you pick the bomb up when it's 2v2 and you just run at the other guy. You drop it and turn around

701
03:06:34,760 --> 03:06:59,299
last second jump. Oh, you're both going down. You gotta get something up. Oh, I don't... Who was it?

702
03:06:59,860 --> 03:07:47,540
Okay, good. Is the game fun? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's really fun. Oh, this cat. Can I pull the cat

703
03:07:47,540 --> 03:08:28,549
through? Okay. Big moves. Big moves. Got two of us here. Clawing under his head. No, we're all

704
03:08:28,549 --> 03:08:40,760
going. Oh, and that one guy that's stuck right there. That's so annoying. Oh, we should have

705
03:08:40,760 --> 03:08:56,139
spread out. That was my fault. I should have went the other way. That's the best one of the whole

706
03:08:56,139 --> 03:09:21,370
night. It's a really good one. How do I add it? I want it. It's a great one. Do you think there'll

707
03:09:21,370 --> 03:09:40,489
ever be one of these where everyone just behaves? Just stands in line? I'd like to see that. Do you

708
03:09:40,489 --> 03:09:52,360
do your own laundry or do you have a butler? I have six butlers. One for the left arm,

709
03:09:52,360 --> 03:09:59,370
one for the right arm, one for my head through, and one to feed me while I'm doing it. The other

710
03:09:59,370 --> 03:10:07,139
two tie my shoes. And then the other one reads me the daily briefing of the day that I need to hear.

711
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:22,920
Number seven brushes my teeth. Number eight has already... I don't know. Number eight can just do

712
03:10:22,920 --> 03:10:50,440
whatever he wants. They asked you if you did your own laundry. Oh, uh, yes. Screw that. I'm going

713
03:10:50,440 --> 03:11:01,700
over here. Why fight when you can guarantee you'll be in the top four if you just smoker?

714
03:11:08,620 --> 03:11:33,129
Oh my god. That was not... I just laid this person out so hard. It's like off the top rope. Excuse

715
03:11:33,129 --> 03:11:50,809
me. Why did we both just do that? That was very odd. I'm not coming up here yet. You can stay up

716
03:11:50,809 --> 03:12:06,790
there and taunt all you want. Look at these clowns over here. Okay, good. Very good. That's exactly

717
03:12:06,790 --> 03:12:20,920
what I was wanting to see. I'm just gonna hold on. I'm just gonna hold on to this pole. Am I

718
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:37,989
still holding on to it? Somebody saved my life. This is like... I had quite a few cocktails. I'm

719
03:12:37,989 --> 03:12:54,840
just gonna lie in here. I am the king of the mountain. I think I won. I did, right? Yeah.

720
03:12:55,399 --> 03:13:28,760
They've been in the water for way longer than I have. Okay, I was gonna say, geez. Oh, it worked.

721
03:13:28,760 --> 03:14:09,190
It worked, but I got hurt. I think I'm gonna be all right. I... I'm gonna be all right. I'm all right.

722
03:14:09,190 --> 03:14:35,610
I can do it. I'm going for another win. All right, who wants to fuck around? That was a big mistake.

723
03:14:36,329 --> 03:14:55,860
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Fine. I'll... It's all right. I still have my teammate here, right?

724
03:14:55,860 --> 03:15:05,180
Pretty sure the teammate... Yeah, teammate's still there, right? Oh, too bad. You can grab right here.

725
03:15:16,950 --> 03:15:53,559
Shit. Well, it looks like it's the... the tower bolt. Let go. Really? That's dirty. That was really dirty.

726
03:16:02,860 --> 03:16:09,260
Dirty. Really dirty. All right, you're playing dirty. That's fine. That's all right. Got my sights on you now.

727
03:16:09,819 --> 03:16:30,739
You're gonna play dirty? Okay. All right. That's fine. You're gonna play dirty? I need to have a chance to get off.

728
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:47,479
Uh, I'm dead. Um, that guy just... All right. Well, now... Now you're dead. My buddy's up there now.

729
03:16:47,479 --> 03:17:01,180
Hey, wait. You want a coin right to the head? Oh, I may have made a mistake. I am bad.

730
03:17:02,059 --> 03:17:12,860
It's okay, though. It's okay. As long as you don't win. Oh, man. I gotta aim much lower than that.

731
03:17:23,139 --> 03:17:29,719
Okay, I gotta hit this. This is make or break. I have to hit this. Who's in first? Who's in first?

732
03:17:31,909 --> 03:17:33,110
Oh, would you look at that?

733
03:17:35,299 --> 03:18:07,989
That's not my stamina though, duckhead. Don't do that. Really?

734
03:18:25,209 --> 03:18:45,750
Say hi to fucking Satan for me. Oh, the rocket went off. Easy. Look at him. That is... That is like

735
03:18:45,750 --> 03:19:10,020
rabid. What? How does he hit me like that? There's no way. I still got my buddy over here. Are you good?

736
03:19:11,239 --> 03:19:17,829
Hey, I'm not going up there. That's a stupid idea. Let's... Hey, hang out down here. Yeah,

737
03:19:17,829 --> 03:19:33,459
let him do that. No room up there. I... I'm gonna uninstall the game. I'm so fucking bad.

738
03:19:39,290 --> 03:19:47,000
I tried to hit it. It's okay. I'm still here. And I'm still a fine... I'm still... No, I'm not. It's

739
03:19:47,000 --> 03:20:01,420
over. Oh my god. I feel so bad. Use me. Use... Just use me. Use me. Use me as a raft. Use me...

740
03:20:01,500 --> 03:20:10,379
Use me as a raft. Use me as a raft. Use me as a raft. Oh, whatever. Oh. Oh, I punched him right in

741
03:20:10,379 --> 03:20:25,219
the nose like it couldn't have been cleaner. Right in the face. Yeah. Yeah. This guy. Yeah.

742
03:20:30,709 --> 03:20:57,799
Get in that racket. I'm gonna smash your head over there. Get out of here. We both need to

743
03:20:57,799 --> 03:21:50,629
have weapons and we got this in the clear. Oh god. No. He's just beating the shit out of my face.

744
03:21:51,350 --> 03:22:40,180
Don't ever suspect anything. Oh, my head's underwater. No. Oh, shit. It depends on who has

745
03:22:40,180 --> 03:22:42,899
the most... How do I... Okay, just... I'm just gonna just explode. Just float. Float. Float. Float.

746
03:22:42,899 --> 03:23:12,659
Float. Float. I'm just gonna float. I'm gonna conserve all my energy. Why'd I die? Oh, I

747
03:23:12,659 --> 03:23:33,190
couldn't turn around fast enough. That's a good one. That's a good one. To throw them off the

748
03:23:33,190 --> 03:23:45,190
submarine. I threw that guy off the submarine three or four times. It's a shame corner. Yeah.

749
03:23:54,459 --> 03:24:02,629
Late night stream. Uh, kind of, yeah. I was around like eight. I was around like about 430. I

750
03:24:02,629 --> 03:24:16,200
probably will do more later streams like late night. I know EU does not want to hear that but

751
03:24:16,200 --> 03:24:38,329
I don't want to start too, too late but around this time is alright. I'm between like four and

752
03:24:38,329 --> 03:25:03,190
seven, four and six Pacific. How long is the Resident Evil 4 DLC? It's football? Oh, this is

753
03:25:03,190 --> 03:25:12,250
so... Can we pass it? You have to get a touchdown? This is so cool. Alright, I probably should be

754
03:25:12,250 --> 03:25:53,659
playing baseball. I wonder if that didn't connect. I got it. Good. What? I got it. I have it. I have

755
03:25:53,659 --> 03:26:28,760
the ball. I have the ball. There we go. About five to six hours. Okay. Oh, this is free.

756
03:26:28,840 --> 03:27:01,379
How have you got so much faster than me? Good, good, good, good, good, good throw, good throw.

757
03:27:02,540 --> 03:27:43,959
Oh. Oh, no stamina. No. Good hit. Yo. Oh, it's not. Wow. Huh? What just happened?

758
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:28,500
They better not. They won't do it. Do goals not work anymore? You have to be holding the ball.

759
03:28:31,579 --> 03:29:11,850
Shoot. I got it. Dang it. Patriots fan. Alright, the same... The Yoshi character just takes it

760
03:29:11,850 --> 03:29:18,329
every time. That Yoshi character just picks it up and runs every... Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

761
03:29:25,829 --> 03:29:38,069
This Gumby character. Put it in there. Is his name Prickle? Yeah. Uh-huh. Let me get through

762
03:29:38,069 --> 03:30:37,940
my defense. Where's, where's, where's... Pass it. Alright, somebody just touch it. Give me this ball.

763
03:30:40,120 --> 03:31:15,159
No, no, no, no. Oh, he's gonna run away with it. Okay, that's a good attempt. Nice try. Your

764
03:31:15,159 --> 03:31:34,329
teammate knocks you out like six times. Yeah, this is the way it is. It's fine. Alright, good, good, good.

765
03:31:35,049 --> 03:31:55,020
Don't let it roll down. Nice. Okay, we're in the game. Chad is helping somebody with their math

766
03:31:55,100 --> 03:32:10,409
homework. I would don't... I do not... I would not take math homework advice from Chad. You're gonna end up...

767
03:32:11,049 --> 03:32:31,799
You're gonna end up like on a different continent. Alright, we're back in this. If you throw it, I'll

768
03:32:31,799 --> 03:33:05,780
get it. I just want to get it down. My Gummy. Did I hit the shark out of 15 people? How did I hit him

769
03:33:05,780 --> 03:33:27,979
right in the forehead? You're still in it. You get that ball down here and I'm gonna run away with it.

770
03:33:27,979 --> 03:33:45,110
Somebody just toss it down here and I got it. Get it down here. You can do it. That's their MVP

771
03:33:45,110 --> 03:34:18,709
right there. I want to get in the picture. I'm always lying down in the pictures. The F-Zero

772
03:34:18,709 --> 03:34:46,790
update came out right now. I feel like that's a lie. It's true. I was trying so hard doing the

773
03:34:46,790 --> 03:34:54,780
practice game. I want to do this. Please, somebody vote for this. No one's doing it. Everybody

774
03:34:54,780 --> 03:35:12,600
picks the soccer or football ones. It looks like trivia. Is it some kind of trivia? I want to see

775
03:35:12,600 --> 03:35:51,540
it. Alright, we need a new hit here. How is Otto? Otto's doing good. He needs to get his teeth

776
03:35:51,540 --> 03:36:06,120
cleaned for that. He needs a dental appointment. The game's a little loud. It is kind of loud.

777
03:36:07,879 --> 03:36:38,420
You're right. Oh, I hit the wrong person. You're quiet too. That might be... I'm leaning back

778
03:36:38,420 --> 03:36:45,500
quite a bit. That's probably why. This new setup, I'll make sure I... I got to get it a little bit

779
03:36:45,500 --> 03:37:14,440
more. The word I'm looking for is complete. I'm getting rolled. This is not good. Who even has...

780
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:27,430
Oh, you have the ball. Alright. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Nice. Wait, did you score on our own goal?

781
03:37:28,649 --> 03:37:42,899
Wait, I'm confused. What just happened? You're red.

782
03:37:43,860 --> 03:38:02,329
You're not very good at this. I'm staying all the way back because they just keep barreling

783
03:38:02,329 --> 03:38:16,280
through everybody and just... Okay, I'm staying back here. Yeah, I know this bullshit. I know

784
03:38:16,280 --> 03:38:44,840
this bullshit tactic. Get out of here. I tried. What back brace were you using for your VR streams?

785
03:38:46,120 --> 03:38:53,819
Um, I kind of flip-flopped between just an abdominal band that I would wear.

786
03:38:54,780 --> 03:39:00,979
Kind of on the upper part of my abdomen. I don't remember the brand though. I think it was just

787
03:39:00,979 --> 03:39:14,219
like an abdominal band. Not tight. Just kind of there. Are you making shit up? Nope. Uh, the VR

788
03:39:14,219 --> 03:39:22,739
streams, I have like a jet pack on on some of them. I used to wear a brace for my chest. It was

789
03:39:22,739 --> 03:39:30,899
like a intercostal pain chest piece. It was okay, but it became pretty clear that it was putting a

790
03:39:30,899 --> 03:39:37,479
little too much pressure on my body and wearing something like that for three, four, five, six,

791
03:39:37,479 --> 03:39:45,559
seven hours sometimes was like, uh, this, I should not be doing this. No, no, I'm, I'm quitting. I'm

792
03:39:45,559 --> 03:40:10,280
rage quitting. I don't want to play soccer again. How are you doing now? It's still there. Eh,

793
03:40:10,280 --> 03:40:34,899
it's all right. Pick a map from the main menu. Maybe stretch before. Yeah. So not to get into

794
03:40:34,899 --> 03:40:44,139
it again for the millionth time, but I just realistically have to go just, just do hernia

795
03:40:44,139 --> 03:40:49,110
surgery. I think that's really what it is. And I, I said that like a year or two ago and I just

796
03:40:49,110 --> 03:40:59,219
never did it, but that might not even be the problem. The last doctor I went to that I had a,

797
03:40:59,219 --> 03:41:03,780
an upper endoscopy, they were like, yeah, you have a idle hernia, but it really shouldn't be

798
03:41:03,780 --> 03:41:14,090
causing those problems. Like, oh, oh shit. And then you kind of start convincing yourself. No,

799
03:41:14,090 --> 03:41:32,090
it has to be that. No, it has to be. It's not, it's nothing else. Get in there. But I'm good.

800
03:41:32,090 --> 03:41:36,920
I'm good. I would tell you if I wasn't, I was pretty transparent about it a few years ago,

801
03:41:41,350 --> 03:41:47,430
just managing it. And then maybe I'll just go in and get surgery done to see if it does anything.

802
03:41:49,799 --> 03:42:00,250
It was officially costochondritis, but I don't know. I don't know if I agree with that. I don't

803
03:42:00,250 --> 03:42:20,229
know. Yeah. I don't want to play. I want to hit people with shovels. I don't want to play soccer.

804
03:42:20,950 --> 03:42:42,760
This has 100% less shovel gameplay. Would it be you're just old baby? I mean, that would be kind

805
03:42:42,760 --> 03:42:51,739
of weird because this started and it's been a while. It's been a long time now. I remember

806
03:42:51,739 --> 03:42:56,260
telling doctors being like, oh yeah, it's been going on for like two or three years now. And

807
03:42:56,260 --> 03:43:05,620
that was 2019, 2020. Right. It's weird how you kind of just get used to something and then just

808
03:43:05,620 --> 03:43:13,959
try to not let it dominate your entire life. And don't get me wrong. I am fine. Like this is not

809
03:43:13,959 --> 03:43:22,010
like debilitating at all. It's just there. It can get a little rough sometimes if I'm,

810
03:43:22,010 --> 03:43:25,530
if I said a certain way or I kind of stand up for too long or sit for too long.

811
03:43:26,329 --> 03:43:38,940
Just had hernia surgery three weeks ago. I hope it fixes whatever is going on with you. No,

812
03:43:39,899 --> 03:44:09,620
don't do it. This dude eats goat cheese. Definitely. I do. I like the bear that right

813
03:44:09,620 --> 03:44:43,319
to the left. I love that. I want one of those. I wish there was a dance. Oh no. You had to eat a

814
03:44:43,319 --> 03:44:54,379
whole frozen stick of butter in 30 minutes. How would you do it? Uh, I wouldn't, but if I had to,

815
03:44:55,829 --> 03:45:05,260
if I had to probably just melt it down and drink it. That seems the least awful way.

816
03:45:08,920 --> 03:45:13,319
What's the stipulation here? Do I have to eat it whole or can I put it in something? But I just

817
03:45:13,319 --> 03:45:19,079
have a wicked gross fettuccine Alfredo that has like a ton of butter in it. Fettuccine Alfredo

818
03:45:19,079 --> 03:45:24,620
already has a stick of butter in it. So I'll just eat some fettuccine Alfredo. I think I've

819
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:43,850
solved your conundrum. I feel like I'm not doing anything, but I also feel like I'm doing a lot.

820
03:45:44,409 --> 03:46:08,569
Just by being a presence back here. See, we won. I did not play. Prove you can make

821
03:46:08,569 --> 03:46:13,430
fettuccine Alfredo. I don't need, I don't know how to make fettuccine Alfredo. I don't know,

822
03:46:13,430 --> 03:46:22,340
butter, shredded cheese, flour, uh, water. I don't even know what's in fettuccine Alfredo.

823
03:46:22,979 --> 03:46:43,370
I know it's like cream, cream, butter, salt, garlic, a little bit of au jus. You know what I

824
03:46:43,370 --> 03:46:51,219
had? Oh man. So my mother made this for me. If you didn't know, I was visiting with my mother

825
03:46:52,389 --> 03:47:01,420
all the way around. And my mother made, it's great to see her by the way. It's been a while.

826
03:47:01,420 --> 03:47:10,219
She tries to make the trip every year or two, but it was wonderful. She taught me how to make

827
03:47:10,219 --> 03:47:16,649
a poached egg because I've tried a million times and I can't do it. But a poached egg on a piece

828
03:47:16,649 --> 03:47:30,809
of toast, jammy in the middle, forget about it. That's the worst egg. Oh no, no. You just haven't

829
03:47:30,809 --> 03:47:39,370
had it made right. Trust me. I've had poached eggs that were just disgusting boogers. I get it. But

830
03:47:39,370 --> 03:47:45,100
a good poached egg, I think is probably the best kind of egg, but they're just so annoying to make.

831
03:47:45,659 --> 03:47:55,450
It's really easy to mess them up. All right, we're going gorilla. Take a piece of toast

832
03:47:55,450 --> 03:48:05,829
or two, two pieces of toast, butter the toast. Nice and buttery. Drop that egg, that poached egg

833
03:48:05,829 --> 03:48:14,170
right on top and just start carving it out with a fork and knife and eating it like steak. So,

834
03:48:14,889 --> 03:48:51,829
so good. I'm putting these in the right side, right? This is not the wrong way, is it?

835
03:48:51,829 --> 03:48:55,750
Yeah, I've heard, uh, my mother talked about the, uh, vinegar, the, I can't say the word,

836
03:48:55,750 --> 03:49:02,569
the vinegar trick. Yeah, poached eggs get really stringy, but if you add vinegar to the water

837
03:49:03,930 --> 03:49:17,319
just a tiny bit, it makes it so it doesn't get so stringy. I'm trying, trying to get him up here.

838
03:49:22,100 --> 03:49:30,659
He's faking his accent. What? What accent? He's faking his accent? What am I doing?

839
03:49:31,219 --> 03:49:35,829
What am I doing? I, I'm not aware of it, whatever it is. What did I do? What did I say?

840
03:49:41,190 --> 03:49:46,840
Am I faking it? I don't know. I don't, I'm not even aware of the word. He just got exposed. I

841
03:49:46,840 --> 03:49:53,659
don't even know what you mean. What word did I say? Mother. Oh, but that's just how you say it.

842
03:50:00,899 --> 03:50:09,159
He just went down. Oh, are you referring to what I just said? Forget about it.

843
03:50:10,120 --> 03:50:40,780
Yeah, that was a little weird. I agree. Oh, look at that pig. You do feel more powerful when you're

844
03:50:40,780 --> 03:51:00,579
the gorilla. Confirmed. Where are you taking it? Get it through the door. Get that pig.

845
03:51:03,750 --> 03:51:26,940
I gotta get this pig. Oh my goodness. Oh my god, I ruined everything. Whoa, we are moving with this

846
03:51:26,940 --> 03:51:54,440
now. Holy shit. We're on point. Pull it. Here we go. Nice. We moved. We went so quick. Oh,

847
03:51:54,440 --> 03:52:17,909
I almost had 11 cookies. That pig was a bat. Oh, a watching bacon and cookies. 12,000. I don't

848
03:52:17,909 --> 03:52:28,739
really want this stuff though. This one's kind of cool. Yeah, I'll get this one. You're not saying

849
03:52:28,739 --> 03:52:57,190
it in the right voice. Yeah, true. Cookies. There you go. Oh, did you mean the Mario version?

850
03:53:00,250 --> 03:53:16,069
Cookies. Well, you got both. I've already dunked your cookie in milk. I've never seen this one.

851
03:53:16,069 --> 03:53:30,090
I thought that said butthole lab. Uh, stay away from the black hole and stay alive. So you take

852
03:53:30,090 --> 03:53:35,719
the cookie if it's an Oreo or if it's a chocolate chip, doesn't matter. You just dunk it halfway.

853
03:53:36,979 --> 03:53:58,469
Count to 10. Take it out. Tap, tap. Bite. Yeah, that's a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Pull it

854
03:53:58,469 --> 03:54:08,790
out. I want it soft, but I don't want it to be mushy. How incompetent do you think we are? No,

855
03:54:09,750 --> 03:54:15,139
that's not what I said. Somebody asked how I dip my cookies in milk. I didn't say every single

856
03:54:15,139 --> 03:54:32,899
person needs to do it like this or you're stupid, but you are if you don't. One omega lull in a sea

857
03:54:32,899 --> 03:54:41,399
of D faces. Hey, hey, hey, hey, you and me get it. Hey, you and me get it. You know what I mean?

858
03:54:41,399 --> 03:55:31,379
This is a cool skin. I like it. All right, don't go in the black hole. Am I doing it right? I think

859
03:55:31,379 --> 03:55:47,829
I just broke my neck. Is he all right? Uh-oh. I think I might be wedged in this. Don't tell him.

860
03:55:47,829 --> 03:56:04,700
I think I just automatically won the game. I think I'm stuck in here. Am I? Something is wedged here

861
03:56:04,700 --> 03:56:10,180
and I can't really figure it out. Oh, I was stuck in the, no, maybe I wasn't. That was weird. I

862
03:56:10,180 --> 03:56:35,479
couldn't move. Oh, that's what just happened. Everybody's a gorilla. Oh, that was an amazing

863
03:56:35,479 --> 03:57:03,260
shot. It's midair. I mean, strategy is obviously grab the cane. They feel about just straight up

864
03:57:03,260 --> 03:57:11,799
milk. Sometimes people treat me like I'm the devil for drinking milk. You do whatever you want. You

865
03:57:11,799 --> 03:57:17,780
you should do eat. You should you should care about whatever you want to care about. Like

866
03:57:17,780 --> 03:57:28,040
things you like. Somebody says it's gross that you drink, uh, you drank, um, like almond milk

867
03:57:28,040 --> 03:57:49,610
or something or regular milk or oat milk. Okay. Every time I talk about the milk that I like,

868
03:57:50,170 --> 03:57:56,649
it's almost like I like almond milk. Well, almond milk is bad. Oh, regular milk. Regular milk is

869
03:57:56,649 --> 03:58:03,770
bad too. Oh, what about, um, oat milk? Oat milk sucks. It's bad. It's really bad. Everything's bad.

870
03:58:04,729 --> 03:58:35,159
Uh, uh, rice, milk, soy milk. I just want my coffee to taste a little creamier. I've somehow

871
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:41,780
made it all the way. Oh, milk is good, but it depends on the brand. Yeah. I like oat milk right

872
03:58:41,780 --> 03:58:55,430
now. I think oatmeal tastes the best out of all of them. I was just missed and went over. That

873
03:58:55,430 --> 03:59:06,540
would have been so funny. Where's the chain? It's over here, isn't it? That's bad. I didn't even get

874
03:59:06,540 --> 03:59:30,219
anything. I got this guy though. All right. We're good. No, that's my friend. It's just a cat and

875
03:59:30,219 --> 03:59:44,180
three gorillas. Why do I feel like they're on the same team even though they're not? No, get away.

876
03:59:44,180 --> 03:59:53,770
It's mine. Fine. He just knocked me out. You better hold onto me. You'd better hold onto me

877
03:59:53,770 --> 04:00:20,010
this whole time. Dude, you killed us both. I love matcha. I just wanted to call him a freak. Matcha

878
04:00:20,010 --> 04:00:36,620
is great too. Ooh. Well, we have to even the odds. Is that going to hit him? It skimmed right over

879
04:00:36,620 --> 04:00:56,139
his head. How long have we gone without talking about milk? Don't you guys feel like it's sometimes

880
04:00:56,139 --> 04:01:10,520
it's like once every two weeks, bro. You just absolute. You know what? Yeah. There you go.

881
04:01:11,159 --> 04:01:22,440
There you go. Yep. I'm going to hit somebody right in the head. What team am I on? Okay. I'm on yellow.

882
04:01:26,520 --> 04:01:31,739
Well, you stream once every two weeks, so yeah. We just talk about milk every single time I'm live.

883
04:01:32,379 --> 04:01:50,549
So you say, oh, milk, but almond milk. I'm going to be such a bastard here. All right. I want to

884
04:01:50,549 --> 04:02:18,579
avoid hitting you. Oh, that's going to be so sad. Is it going to get anybody? No. Stop engaging in

885
04:02:18,579 --> 04:02:25,379
the conversation. I like that conversation. It's fun, but also to something to keep in mind.

886
04:02:25,459 --> 04:02:32,540
How many people here? It's very possible that there's like 11,000, like 10,000 very much.

887
04:02:32,540 --> 04:02:36,059
Oh shit. I just clicked back into the window and threw the bomb into the trash.

888
04:02:37,420 --> 04:02:41,500
All right. So if this 10,000 people here, it's very possible that this 10,000 people

889
04:02:42,139 --> 04:02:47,819
is a different 10,000 people next time. And the time after that, it could be like another

890
04:02:47,819 --> 04:02:56,889
10,000 different people. Everyone's not all here at the same exact time at the same exact stream.

891
04:03:06,440 --> 04:03:13,190
So if we talk about, uh, oat milk, we might be talking to a completely different group of people.

892
04:03:13,829 --> 04:03:57,690
I still got it. It's okay. Oh, what? No, give it to me. Aha. That's a win right there. At least

893
04:03:57,690 --> 04:04:23,879
it should be. Pick them up already. Why did that explode? Okay. Are you high? No, I'm just chilling

894
04:04:23,879 --> 04:04:46,680
man. Hey, I've done that a million times before. I know how it feels. Dude, don't. You're doing it

895
04:04:46,680 --> 04:05:09,770
on purpose. Of course they are. How would it be on accident? You're just dropping people left and

896
04:05:09,770 --> 04:05:28,780
right. This. Why am I, am I holding it? He's holding it with one hand. Why? Put both hands

897
04:05:28,780 --> 04:06:19,079
on it, please. Oh, you're getting dunked. Hey, we did it. On the ground again. Milk and Pepsi.

898
04:06:19,079 --> 04:06:28,170
I drank the, the pilk on stream. Weird, but it was okay. I would never drink it again, but

899
04:06:28,170 --> 04:06:44,329
I wouldn't spit it out. I love pilk. Hashtag pilk fan. If we have an opportunity, please vote for

900
04:06:44,329 --> 04:06:51,610
that one. One person voted for that. One person voted for it and we're going there. Two of us

901
04:06:51,610 --> 04:07:05,620
voted on the right one. Everybody wants to play sports. I just want to beat people up with shovels.

902
04:07:05,620 --> 04:07:38,299
I need to read this because I, I don't even know what it is. Oh no, I don't. Okay, never mind. What just hit me?

903
04:07:38,299 --> 04:07:57,739
Oh, it was the puck. All right. And there it is. No, there's a cow. I love that. I want that.

904
04:07:58,379 --> 04:08:46,100
That's the best skin in the whole game. It's just so perfect. Big fat orange cat is cool too.

905
04:08:46,100 --> 04:09:03,219
God, that was a good block. That was good. Damn it. I wasn't, if I was lined up right there,

906
04:09:03,940 --> 04:09:19,500
it was just a little to the left. Okay. Oh, it's perfect. Somebody to get it. It's right there.

907
04:09:19,500 --> 04:10:01,780
Look. Set me up. Set me up. Damn it. I think I'm going to get an opportunity right. Get it out of

908
04:10:01,780 --> 04:11:12,579
the corner. Ouch. Do not. Wow. I thought that went in. Is it in? This is a pretty good game so far.

909
04:11:12,579 --> 04:11:37,780
Sorry. Sorry. Not sorry. Racist. Do something about racist. Mean Geno. I'm trying. I had it first.

910
04:11:37,780 --> 04:11:43,299
Macho Man is a voice that if you can do it, you can sometimes do it for like three seconds and

911
04:11:43,299 --> 04:12:04,569
then it just turns into something else. Yeah. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. Let me. Macho Man.

912
04:12:04,569 --> 04:12:26,840
Randy Savage. I'm trying to do a voice. Don't punch me. Cream of the crop. They'll just never

913
04:12:26,840 --> 04:12:31,479
be another Macho Man. Randy Savage. There's a lot of those guys that just, they'll never be another

914
04:12:31,479 --> 04:12:50,819
one ever again. Ever. All right. I want to get lined up. This cow is a good goalie. We got to

915
04:12:50,819 --> 04:13:07,319
get that shield away from you. Right now. A lot of you might not know this, but you know the way

916
04:13:07,319 --> 04:13:12,860
that I talk sometimes where I talk like this. Emphasizing a lot of the W's. That's Mean Gene

917
04:13:12,860 --> 04:13:20,459
Oakland. Mean Gene Oakland was a huge, huge influence on like voice stuff. He had this

918
04:13:20,459 --> 04:13:29,879
incredibly particular way of talking. He was a master at it. You just did it in your own goal?

919
04:13:29,879 --> 04:14:05,780
Oh, sorry. Oops. I'll make up for it right now. Get up. What? Oh, I thought we got a goal because

920
04:14:05,780 --> 04:14:17,180
he put the shield in his own goal. That's weird. Set me up. Set me up. Set me up. Set me up. Set

921
04:14:17,180 --> 04:14:49,879
me up. I'll be goalie. That's fine. I keep getting clocked by this thing every time. That's a

922
04:14:49,879 --> 04:15:05,899
beautiful setup. Oh yes. There we go. I haven't seen him contribute in any way. You must have

923
04:15:05,899 --> 04:15:09,340
just came to the stream because I'm the one that got the first goal and it was a beautiful shot.

924
04:15:11,020 --> 04:15:28,020
Like this. Good tie. Oh no, we won. He was the team's clown. Yeah, I have to entertain everybody.

925
04:15:28,899 --> 04:15:54,540
The goal. I finally got my face in a picture. No more sports. More shovel. Yeah, that's what I'm

926
04:15:54,540 --> 04:16:13,180
saying. You always feel the compulsive need to entertain everybody. I think that just comes

927
04:16:13,180 --> 04:16:20,790
with not being able to sit still. So talking a lot is a way to expel a lot of energy.

928
04:16:26,020 --> 04:16:34,120
Which I usually have a lot of. Maybe not so much anymore, but I still do. 10 years ago, 15 years ago,

929
04:16:34,120 --> 04:16:39,079
I was just a ball of just energy that had to constantly be doing something or talking or

930
04:16:39,079 --> 04:16:46,309
moving. I've definitely mellowed out a lot in the last five years, I'd say. Without a doubt.

931
04:16:46,309 --> 04:17:22,920
You're a mellow yellow. Do I? Wait a minute. That's soda, right? It's a drink. Just block them all.

932
04:17:23,559 --> 04:17:29,190
That's a great strategy. Make it so they can't get over here.

933
04:17:29,750 --> 04:17:47,610
I don't have stamina. How are we holding hands backwards behind? That was very strange.

934
04:17:49,700 --> 04:18:02,889
God damn it. Is Mountain Dew for boring people? I didn't even mean to do that and I hit my own

935
04:18:02,889 --> 04:18:14,540
teammate. No, I didn't. OK, I'm on green this time. Mellow yellow is boring? I feel like that's the

936
04:18:14,540 --> 04:18:18,139
opposite because wouldn't Mountain Dew be the default and that's just the one to get because

937
04:18:18,139 --> 04:18:23,479
it's Mountain Dew because it's everywhere and it's the popular one? Mellow yellow to me is no,

938
04:18:23,479 --> 04:18:29,079
we don't got Mountain Dew. We got mellow yellow. It's like, whoa, interesting. You've got,

939
04:18:29,079 --> 04:18:38,020
I haven't seen that in a while. That's like having squirt in your fridge. It's like,

940
04:18:38,020 --> 04:18:45,049
oh shit, you've got, you've got squirt? I would have thought it would have been a Sprite.

941
04:19:01,270 --> 04:19:09,030
Oh, whatever. I don't care. I don't even care. I don't care. Oh shit.

942
04:19:19,579 --> 04:19:34,940
Oh, that was very embarrassing, but it's OK. I just forgot to hold right trigger to grab onto

943
04:19:34,940 --> 04:20:08,440
the ledge and just hit my teeth off the ledge. Squirt is a good soda. One of the best. Not

944
04:20:08,440 --> 04:20:32,739
messing around this time. Wow, nice. Ooh, tiger skin. There are a lot more models in this game

945
04:20:32,739 --> 04:20:44,840
than I thought there were going to be. Highlord Tyrion Fordring needs you, champion. The Lich

946
04:20:44,840 --> 04:20:57,459
King must be stopped. Yeah, I also can sit in Dalaran for 60 minutes a day and hear that

947
04:20:58,500 --> 04:21:20,950
two or three times. One shot, one shot, one shot to get up. Please get up. One shot. You're going

948
04:21:20,950 --> 04:21:35,209
to get us both killed. You're going to get us both killed. Who's your favorite Dragonball Z

949
04:21:35,209 --> 04:21:52,729
character? Who's the one that goes like this? Boo. That's right. That's the one. I'm alive,

950
04:21:52,729 --> 04:22:13,719
right? I'm holding it. Not Mr. Satan. No, it's not Boo. I don't give a shit about Boo

951
04:22:13,719 --> 04:22:28,950
at all. I just thought it'd be funny to do that for five seconds. It's Mr. Satan. It's not Mr.

952
04:22:28,950 --> 04:22:33,030
Satan. I just like that voice. So I say it's my favorite character, but it's actually Beerus.

953
04:22:33,829 --> 04:22:52,649
Fuck that guy. It's Goku. You know what I mean? And that's how you tell everybody

954
04:22:53,370 --> 04:23:03,770
your top four favorite DBZ character. He's on the wiki looking at them all.

955
04:23:05,209 --> 04:23:10,170
In the beginning of the stream, I told you I was lying down. I don't have Wikipedia over here.

956
04:23:10,889 --> 04:23:21,260
I'm lying in one of those beanbag chair, upright chair things on the ground. I don't

957
04:23:21,260 --> 04:23:41,000
got Wikipedia. You lost viewers for that? Oh, they weren't strong enough. I thought

958
04:23:41,000 --> 04:23:48,360
you were going to punch me, but you didn't. So I'm not going to punch you. Look at that tiger.

959
04:23:49,159 --> 04:23:59,770
That's so sad. That's so sad. He made it? What? I just knocked myself out?

960
04:24:08,520 --> 04:24:13,260
I was trying to. Okay. I did not know that could happen.

961
04:24:17,850 --> 04:24:48,649
You got styled on. I did. You're right. We still got a shot. Oh, now you're all in trouble.

962
04:24:49,450 --> 04:25:18,229
That was my friend, but it's okay. It's not here yet. Please lift that up. Don't leave me hanging.

963
04:25:19,319 --> 04:25:43,510
Keep it up. Thank you. Oh, we got a 2v1 scenario, don't we? No. Did I die?

964
04:25:46,379 --> 04:26:09,190
I'm dead. I didn't even know that was possible. That alligator is so fucked up right now.

965
04:26:13,540 --> 04:26:49,370
Stop. Somebody has to pull the lever. I'll do it. What's this? Is this a helmet?

966
04:26:54,420 --> 04:27:29,510
My buddy's still here. Oh, shit. Don't. What? It broke. It broke. Why am I getting the three

967
04:27:29,510 --> 04:27:48,920
stooges shit happening to me all the time? All right. That's not a bad photo. Preferred

968
04:27:48,920 --> 04:27:58,059
brand vacuum cleaner. A stick vacuum. I don't have to plug it in. I'm a mover. I'm like a

969
04:27:58,059 --> 04:28:04,100
cellar spider when I vacuum. I'm just up all over the place. I'll start in the corner in one room.

970
04:28:04,100 --> 04:28:09,299
I'll just walk to the other room and just go in the other room. In the bedroom. One, two, three.

971
04:28:09,299 --> 04:28:18,840
Just walk across the fucking hall. Just go across to the other room. In the bathroom. Just zooming

972
04:28:18,840 --> 04:28:27,399
around with a stick vacuum. Because when you don't have a stick vacuum, you end up having

973
04:28:27,399 --> 04:28:32,059
you're tethered to the plug. Vacuum a whole room with a plug in the wall and all of a sudden it's

974
04:28:32,059 --> 04:28:37,819
like, yeah, I got to unplug this. Pick this up. It's kind of heavy. I got a bag. I got to move to

975
04:28:37,819 --> 04:28:44,090
another room. Where's an outlet? Am I going to have the problem where I vacuum too far where

976
04:28:44,090 --> 04:28:49,750
the outlet can't reach and there's just one strip that is just never done because I just don't care

977
04:28:49,750 --> 04:29:05,319
about the vacuum can't go that far? Stick vacuum. Add coal into the furnace to speed up your train.

978
04:29:05,319 --> 04:29:20,180
Okay. Bro, what's the brand? We don't want to rant. Um, I had a Dyson stick vacuum,

979
04:29:20,819 --> 04:29:30,950
but I broke it. I have it. A Dyson is like, it's like a Cadillac. I just, I, I don't want to get

980
04:29:30,950 --> 04:29:40,469
another one. Cause what if I break that one? And they're very expensive. One of my friends came

981
04:29:40,469 --> 04:29:47,049
over one time and they thought I had one of those standing hand sanitizers in the corner of the

982
04:29:47,049 --> 04:29:53,430
room. Like they were like, why do you have a big hand sanitizer? I was like, that's not what that

983
04:29:53,510 --> 04:30:03,639
is. Cause it does kind of look like one. It looks like a big standing hand sanitizer. He was like,

984
04:30:03,639 --> 04:30:06,920
I was going to go over and put my hand underneath it. I thought you were a weirdo for a second,

985
04:30:06,920 --> 04:30:46,200
but it's a vacuum. What train am I putting this? I never played this one before. Holy

986
04:30:46,200 --> 04:31:26,620
shit. Drop it. That was a big one too. Let's go put them in the furnace. Oh, that was a bad idea.

987
04:31:40,020 --> 04:31:45,159
Damn it. All right. They're ahead of us. Forget about that guy. He's just going to troll us.

988
04:32:00,459 --> 04:32:30,280
Okay. What does this do? Is it the gas? I didn't know if you had to heat it up.

989
04:32:30,840 --> 04:32:45,850
Why would you break? Oh, but why? Oh, I get it. I was saying, why is there a lever on? I get it.

990
04:32:45,850 --> 04:32:55,700
I get it. I get it. All right. We're going to, we'll be fine. Oh my God. You are shit face.

991
04:32:55,700 --> 04:33:33,720
Just get it in. I'm so sad. I'm an anchor right now. Misjudge the jump just a little.

992
04:33:34,439 --> 04:34:05,610
Steal this too. Oh, give me the shovel. We're winning. I was such an annoying distraction.

993
04:34:05,610 --> 04:34:43,380
We won. My head. Fuck you. We did it. Oops. Yeah. They're not halfway there. We've

994
04:34:44,020 --> 04:35:16,040
been by a mile. I got it. Yes. I want that one. I got it. I did not think I was going to be playing

995
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:31,029
this for almost five hours, but it's really fun. How do you feel about boiled peanuts?

996
04:35:32,360 --> 04:35:38,700
I don't know if I've ever had them. I don't really know. I ate them. What are they in?

997
04:35:39,419 --> 04:36:07,509
You just eat them by themselves. I don't think I've ever had it before. So do you take the

998
04:36:07,509 --> 04:36:18,279
peanuts out of the shells or is it in the shells? And then you take them out in the shells. Okay.

999
04:36:18,279 --> 04:36:31,029
You know what? You take them out. How long do you boil them in the shells for in water?

1000
04:36:35,560 --> 04:36:49,770
They're so good. Seven hours. You do it for a couple of what you boil them for hours.

1001
04:36:55,060 --> 04:37:04,490
I kind of am interested in this though. So not you just talking about like on the stovetop.

1002
04:37:04,490 --> 04:37:26,040
I feel like that would be kind of crazy. Rock pot will do it. Yeah. On low heat. Let me take

1003
04:37:26,040 --> 04:37:37,159
care of this guy. This person just had a bunch of groceries in their hands. That was so sad.

1004
04:37:37,159 --> 04:37:46,099
This is one of those games where you just giggle. Wait, you mean I can smash somebody's head with

1005
04:37:46,099 --> 04:38:09,849
this? We got to go. You got it. We got to shove it in. Just kick it in. Kick it. Punch it. How

1006
04:38:09,849 --> 04:38:13,529
do you do emotes? There we go. That was weird. It was like I was trying to press left stick,

1007
04:38:13,529 --> 04:38:22,060
right stick. That was so lucky that we got this immediate spawn. If the team is AFK. Oh,

1008
04:38:22,060 --> 04:38:55,979
that's sad. All right. Good job. You didn't have to go in too. We can let them get one gumdrop.

1009
04:38:55,979 --> 04:39:14,779
Right? We can't just take them all. We got the perfect placement on this too. This is the way

1010
04:39:14,779 --> 04:39:41,689
to do it. And they were AFK. Oh, I just won a quick match without being knocked out. I don't

1011
04:39:41,770 --> 04:40:14,099
know where I am. Oh, I got money. Let's open up one of those surprise eggs. 200. So if I

1012
04:40:14,740 --> 04:40:37,000
1080, I feel like that's going to take a while. Yeah. I want one now. It's green. What is it?

1013
04:40:37,000 --> 04:41:06,520
Is that like epic or something? Cute. Pink sparky. Uncommon. Dark ancient underbite.

1014
04:41:06,520 --> 04:41:41,450
Don't I already have this? I want to see those ones. What were those? Dark ooga. Okay. But could

1015
04:41:41,450 --> 04:42:04,790
you beat Goku though? Yes. I 100%. I 100% could beat Goku at rock, paper, scissors. Maybe spend

1016
04:42:04,790 --> 04:42:30,470
five grand on skins. No. Can you even use real money? You can. All right. I got some cool stuff.

1017
04:42:30,470 --> 04:42:45,990
What'd I get? I got a melon hat. How do I change outfit? Oh, there we go. Melon hat or do that one.

1018
04:42:45,990 --> 04:42:59,029
I mean, maybe I get a little, like a little bit of the in-game currency, but I'm going to spend

1019
04:42:59,029 --> 04:43:19,909
$5,000. That's too much. How did we fuck that up? How did we screw that up? I was going to say that

1020
04:43:19,909 --> 04:43:40,709
was three knuckleheads. Yeah. I think the game's definitely worth it. Especially if you have a

1021
04:43:40,709 --> 04:43:51,849
group of friends. This is one of those ultimate party games and the varieties there. I thought

1022
04:43:51,849 --> 04:44:09,540
this was going to be four maps or so. I was completely wrong. And yeah, it's on. I thought

1023
04:44:09,540 --> 04:44:21,430
that was one of my teammates pissed that I kept trying to grab the ball. Can somebody get it in

1024
04:44:21,430 --> 04:44:30,009
there? It's on Game Pass. That's right. Ace Attorney is coming to Game Pass. You have no excuse now.

1025
04:44:30,009 --> 04:45:08,069
Okay. True. That's true. Trying to run away with it here. Don't tease me like that. I'll play. I'm

1026
04:45:08,069 --> 04:45:16,229
definitely not going to play the whole series. I'm not going to do all of them. I'll try one or two

1027
04:45:16,229 --> 04:45:35,299
cases because I don't know how much I like those games. Genuinely. I've never played one. I have

1028
04:45:35,299 --> 04:45:43,159
downloaded them on four separate devices over the course of 10 years, but I haven't played it.

1029
04:45:44,439 --> 04:45:57,450
I know. It's weird. I've gotten it on iPad, on Steam, on what was the like, like a PS4.

1030
04:45:59,880 --> 04:46:04,360
I've just, I buy it every single console generation with the intent that I'm going to play it.

1031
04:46:04,439 --> 04:46:23,700
And I just don't. They're not great stream games. Yeah. But I mean, I got a new philosophy anyways,

1032
04:46:23,700 --> 04:46:29,639
right? Doesn't everything doesn't have to be, oh, it's going to be really high energy and

1033
04:46:30,200 --> 04:46:36,419
tons of interaction. And maybe it's just fun to do one day just to hang out and play it.

1034
04:46:39,080 --> 04:46:41,319
A lot of reading out loud. Well, I do sorcery. Sorcery is fun.

1035
04:46:42,119 --> 04:46:59,860
Kind of the same thing, right? Yeah. I've said a thousand year door. That's the one where Luigi

1036
04:46:59,860 --> 04:47:27,849
goes. I'll give it a try. That was a great walk down there by player 244. I'll tell you what I'm

1037
04:47:27,849 --> 04:47:37,369
the most excited for besides Elden Rings DLC. WarioWare. They're going back to the basics

1038
04:47:37,369 --> 04:47:53,000
on WarioWare. That is, I'm going to play the absolute hell out of that game. I'm going,

1039
04:47:53,000 --> 04:48:05,700
I'm going to try to 100% that game. I hope it's good. You can swear, you know, right?

1040
04:48:07,419 --> 04:48:18,490
Yeah. But my mother was just here and I'm kind of used to being a little more, a little more tame.

1041
04:48:19,590 --> 04:48:22,790
All right, everybody, if you're in the game right now, dude, oh, we're doing icebreaker.

1042
04:48:22,790 --> 04:48:34,229
I want to, what is that one? But you're almost 40. It doesn't matter how, if you're 30, 40, 50,

1043
04:48:34,229 --> 04:48:38,950
nobody wants to be like, oh, fuck this. Fuck you. And fuck that and fucking whatever.

1044
04:48:38,950 --> 04:49:02,549
It's my mother. You're going to come on. My mom cusses a lot. Yeah. My mother swears too a lot.

1045
04:49:03,189 --> 04:49:13,430
My mother and father both swear. It was never like weird, but I tone it down. You tone it down

1046
04:49:13,430 --> 04:49:36,340
a little bit. You don't want to, you just don't want to overdo it in front of ma and dad. My mom

1047
04:49:36,340 --> 04:49:52,069
is here. How come you're not playing this? I'm sure your mother would think this was fun. I'm

1048
04:49:52,069 --> 04:50:06,869
sure your mother would love this game. Why you guys should play it. Family friendly streamer.

1049
04:50:06,869 --> 04:50:21,400
Stay tuned. Coming up next. We got, can't think of anything funny. Just imagine I was pretending

1050
04:50:21,400 --> 04:50:44,599
to be a like G rated person. Okay. So how do we feel about that? I somehow got the W on that one.

1051
04:50:44,599 --> 04:51:13,020
And I don't know how. You're watching the Disney channel. Oh, that's also a dinosaur.

1052
04:51:27,590 --> 04:51:55,590
Ooh. Oh, that shut the whole crowd up. I just slipped on the banana field. All right. We're

1053
04:51:55,590 --> 04:52:21,849
good. Sorry, mom. They were Yoshis before. Yeah, that's true. They can stay Yoshis. My shovel.

1054
04:52:26,060 --> 04:52:48,790
I did not hit my head on the shovel. Right. We can all agree on that. Shit. Oh, that's not good.

1055
04:52:51,560 --> 04:53:07,159
That's bad. Not good. I'm going to die. I'm so greedy. I want it so bad. And now I'm dead.

1056
04:53:08,869 --> 04:53:38,060
Now I think I'm dead. I'm so sorry. I forgot you were on my team. Get me away from the edge.

1057
04:53:54,439 --> 04:54:08,549
Damn it. Oh, that's so sad. That's very sad. I couldn't get him with the, I still have a

1058
04:54:08,549 --> 04:54:38,630
teammate in here, right? Not anymore. Too slippery. Is this a bit? Uh, no, it's just when the changing

1059
04:54:38,630 --> 04:54:46,299
teams like one round, you're on green one game. You're on blue one. You're on red. Oh my God.

1060
04:54:46,299 --> 04:55:28,919
That was a great shot. Oh, I hit him. I had this exact same idea and we both missed. You leave him,

1061
04:55:28,919 --> 04:55:47,299
but leave him alone. Leave him alone. This is my friend. That was a dangerous move, but it was

1062
04:55:47,299 --> 04:56:28,500
worth it. Oh, I took his head off. Just jumped over it. Let go of the shovel and get up, bro.

1063
04:56:29,220 --> 04:56:37,380
What are you doing? I couldn't drop the shovel. I couldn't drop the shovel.

1064
04:56:37,939 --> 04:56:50,299
It was just still in my hands. Oh, I got you. I got you. I got you. You got it. I know you got

1065
04:56:50,299 --> 04:57:11,669
this. Roman, Roman, Roman. That's teamwork right there. You can do it. No, it was a good try.

1066
04:57:12,229 --> 04:57:43,819
Nice try. Anybody's game. I, I, I have no defense on that. I don't have a defense on what just

1067
04:57:43,819 --> 04:57:51,340
happened. Dude, you're going to kill yourself too. You're going to die down here too. It's not worth

1068
04:57:51,340 --> 04:58:07,909
it. You, you, it's not worth it. Trust me. Just get up there. See, forget about the bat. No,

1069
04:58:08,709 --> 04:58:32,169
you okay? Don't get on this. I'm dead. I was just way too far away. I wouldn't have made it.

1070
04:58:32,729 --> 04:59:05,319
Is my buddy still here? No. He doesn't see it. You're a bad teammate. I accidentally hit him.

1071
04:59:05,319 --> 04:59:10,060
I protected him at least two or three times, but it was the one time that I hit him in the head

1072
04:59:10,060 --> 04:59:28,439
with the shovel. You guys are going to keep going back to a lot of stuff. All right. Deny yellow at

1073
04:59:28,439 --> 05:00:22,759
all costs. That was the plan. Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up. All right. Dunk him. As long

1074
05:00:22,759 --> 05:00:47,930
as I don't go in the water, I don't care. Shit. That's bad. Oh, thank God. I just can't catch a

1075
05:00:47,930 --> 05:01:07,319
break. Get me up. Oh, what? How am I still here? Time for you to go for a fucking swim.

1076
05:01:26,709 --> 05:01:39,939
Oh shit. Shovel versus pan. Oh shit. Oh, I thought I had an extra half second. No,

1077
05:01:42,470 --> 05:01:54,819
he got me with the very, very end of it. It was like the tip of the top of it. He had the length.

1078
05:01:54,819 --> 05:02:01,189
Yeah. I was always going to be hard. He had a full foot on me and what he could be able to swing

1079
05:02:01,189 --> 05:02:28,299
with. I made it in the picture. All right. Last one. Last one. And then I am going to go eat some

1080
05:02:28,299 --> 05:02:42,259
dinner and I'm going to go chill. What's the other game I said I wanted to play? Oh,

1081
05:02:42,259 --> 05:02:58,599
Resident Evil 4 DLC. Uh, we got to close it on a typhoon. It's the best one. F 0 99 and the DLC

1082
05:02:58,599 --> 05:03:19,669
for Resident Evil 4. He's addicted to the funny animal game. Oh, it's great. It's great. Let me

1083
05:03:19,669 --> 05:03:37,479
think of some good. Let me look at the calendar. Maybe Sunday, Sunday or Monday. All right. I got

1084
05:03:37,479 --> 05:03:58,340
to go out big. So my best games were with the cat. When are you going to stream? Uh, either Sunday

1085
05:03:58,340 --> 05:04:04,650
or Monday or this week? Likely Monday. Monday makes the most sense for me. Schedule wise.

1086
05:04:05,369 --> 05:04:38,840
It's going to be annoying over here. No, you don't understand. It's the boat. That's the problem.

1087
05:04:38,840 --> 05:04:51,459
It's the boat. That's the problem. We need to fight the boat. You guys don't get it. They want

1088
05:04:51,459 --> 05:05:09,610
us to fucking kill each other and then they'll get all the snacks. Oh God. Watch out. I'm just

1089
05:05:09,610 --> 05:05:24,490
climbing up. If there's ever a game that I wish the floss was in, it's this one because I would

1090
05:05:24,490 --> 05:05:59,080
just do it right here. Welcome. What the hell was that? I don't think a bird shit on me. Oh,

1091
05:05:59,880 --> 05:06:08,380
I don't think any of us are going to get out of here. Yeah, there's, there's no getting up.

1092
05:06:10,180 --> 05:06:37,659
Okay. Now there is, this is a victory for sure. Come on, come on. I had more health than you did.

1093
05:06:39,900 --> 05:07:09,029
I had more health than you. Didn't I? Oh, but cracked out right now. Hey, what's up? You piece

1094
05:07:09,029 --> 05:07:23,720
of shit. Oh, that's my friend. So fucking sorry. I'm so sorry. He's AFK. Whatever. It doesn't matter.

1095
05:07:23,720 --> 05:07:40,729
It's not like he was playing anyways. Oh boy. I might be in trouble. I don't think I have enough

1096
05:07:40,729 --> 05:08:24,330
stamina to get up all the way. Oh, it's going to be close. Okay. You dummy. Oh no, my friend. Oh,

1097
05:08:29,819 --> 05:08:47,349
stay up back into the cockpit again. I was going to spam the head butt button and see what happens.

1098
05:08:56,599 --> 05:09:00,680
He was just left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right to my face

1099
05:09:00,680 --> 05:09:27,419
and killed me. Come on, man. Yeah, that was all wind up in the face. Right hand,

1100
05:09:27,979 --> 05:09:35,750
elbow up, back, left hand in the face. Repeat 10 times. I was not going to get up from that.

1101
05:09:36,310 --> 05:10:08,389
I'm going off the stop rope. Oh, the rocket came out. I just got rocked. Come on. It's right there.

1102
05:10:08,389 --> 05:10:22,340
Grab it. It's right here. Put somebody in the missile silo. I got somebody in the very beginning

1103
05:10:22,340 --> 05:10:29,639
of the stream. Dammit. Well, let's see if I can blow somebody up. Is my teammate still here?

1104
05:10:30,439 --> 05:10:46,060
Oh no, they're AFK now. Good placement. Yes. Holy shit. That was diabolical, dude.

1105
05:10:46,779 --> 05:10:53,509
You already had the wind. You froze him and then just kicked his dead, lifeless body into the

1106
05:10:53,509 --> 05:11:05,930
water. That was terrible. What are you looking at? Whoops. I'm going to get him right in the head.

1107
05:11:07,639 --> 05:11:42,619
No. Fuck. How much higher? Of course. We want yellow to win, but looks a little hairy right now.

1108
05:11:43,340 --> 05:12:20,740
Oh, maybe. Okay. We need a crown too. Yeah. Let's get this. Let's get this party going.

1109
05:12:20,740 --> 05:12:28,729
I'm underneath this and I can't get up. What the fuck? Am I underneath the boat?

1110
05:12:35,180 --> 05:13:15,639
Oh, that rocket's coming out. Blast him. This is going to be so scary for this guy.

1111
05:13:28,340 --> 05:13:56,759
Nice try. Fuck that. You thought you could get rid of me? Not yet. That's not fair. They shouldn't

1112
05:13:56,759 --> 05:14:02,700
be able to throw things from the stands. You shouldn't be able to throw things from the

1113
05:14:02,700 --> 05:14:33,770
stands. That's just not... That's very dangerous. I just hit with the ground. Oh, all right. I went

1114
05:14:33,770 --> 05:14:41,590
for the punch. Is there a reason why I was just electrocuted for a hundred million years?

1115
05:14:42,150 --> 05:15:09,110
Why me? Why me? Anybody else? Leave me alone. Somebody help me. Oh,

1116
05:15:10,069 --> 05:15:15,619
now the tables have turned. Looks like you're in a little bit of a pickle, aren't you?

1117
05:15:16,500 --> 05:15:43,930
Be careful down there. Oh, you're alive I see. Hello, Captain. I thought I was friendly.

1118
05:15:44,569 --> 05:15:52,919
I was not. It always happens like this. And then someone's going to drop a brick on my head and

1119
05:15:52,919 --> 05:16:05,720
they're going to throw me overboard. This gorilla... Yeah, see? Somebody stop him. Stop him.

1120
05:16:05,720 --> 05:16:15,990
Gorilla, help me. It's 2v2 with one on each team. 2v2. That's fine. I'll just climb to the top.

1121
05:16:22,630 --> 05:17:10,090
Ow. Let go. I should have won that. This didn't have enough health. Watch out. Why am I not

1122
05:17:10,090 --> 05:17:29,000
swinging it? Damn it. You want to put me in the fucking juice machine, huh? You want to put me

1123
05:17:29,000 --> 05:17:36,009
in the juicer? I think you're gonna put me in the fucking meat grinder, don't you? Well, now we're

1124
05:17:36,009 --> 05:18:02,439
both dead. I hope you're happy. I gotta go. Oh my god. That was the strongest headbutt I have ever

1125
05:18:02,439 --> 05:18:15,540
seen. That was... I just got sent to outer space. You can definitely get there. Are you kidding me?

1126
05:18:16,340 --> 05:18:53,419
Sitting there. I'm holding Y and right trigger and this won't do it. I have to try. Too much lasagna?

1127
05:18:54,380 --> 05:19:11,959
That was a crazy headbutt. Is it green? It wasn't blue. All right, one more. I want to do one more.

1128
05:19:11,959 --> 05:19:48,709
Actually, one more. I mean it. I just went out really badly. Rude. Rude. Still looked the coolest

1129
05:19:48,709 --> 05:20:00,490
though. There's some pretty cool cats here. This game seems rage-inducing. You would think so,

1130
05:20:00,490 --> 05:20:17,400
but everything is so goofily presented that you can't be. Please play as Melon Dog. I don't think

1131
05:20:17,400 --> 05:20:53,080
I can. Don't pull the brake this time. Yeah, I'll try. I'll be Melon Dog. Should I actually

1132
05:20:53,080 --> 05:21:12,340
try winning this time? It's not about winning. It's about... Whoa. Is that a moose? That's cool.

1133
05:21:12,340 --> 05:21:25,830
What an insane animal a moose is. Sometimes you forget just how unbelievably massive a moose

1134
05:21:25,830 --> 05:21:38,409
really is. They're like elephants. They're gigantic. They're such a majestic... Are those antlers too?

1135
05:22:02,419 --> 05:22:05,540
What? Was it the sign? Did I get hit in the face by the sign?

1136
05:22:06,409 --> 05:22:27,560
Oh. All right. I'm gonna go fuck with the other team. It's just like looking into the abyss.

1137
05:22:28,540 --> 05:22:43,500
I have... I just... I need to go over here. All right. Well, they let me help them. Let's see.

1138
05:22:50,310 --> 05:23:11,400
Stop. I'm on your team. Holy shit. It's a mess over here. I want to play too. Actually, you know,

1139
05:23:11,400 --> 05:23:28,979
while that's happening, let's load this shit up. Forget about this. All right. Forget about the

1140
05:23:29,779 --> 05:23:39,860
moose. Just put the coal in. He's doing it on purpose to mess with us. It's such a great strategy

1141
05:23:40,419 --> 05:23:45,900
because it's just like I have to get this moose. He's just... We have to kill him. And then you

1142
05:23:45,900 --> 05:23:58,659
can just get distracted the whole time. All right. Somebody kill the moose. No. No. Get me out of the

1143
05:23:58,659 --> 05:24:41,779
fire. Whoa. Easy. I think we can still do it. Okay. I've had just about enough of this. Get out of

1144
05:24:41,779 --> 05:25:16,040
here. Hey. Okay. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

1145
05:25:16,040 --> 05:25:22,139
I think we're going to lose. It wasn't my fault though. I just jumped off the edge like five

1146
05:25:22,139 --> 05:25:35,619
times accidentally and then accidentally killed the teammate and a little bros running around

1147
05:25:35,619 --> 05:25:41,270
here with a tennis racket right now. He's no regard for anything. He's just hitting every...

1148
05:25:41,270 --> 05:25:45,990
It doesn't matter who it... He doesn't care what letters or colors or... He's just hitting

1149
05:25:45,990 --> 05:26:04,939
everybody it doesn't matter who it is this this gator needs to be stopped immediately he still

1150
05:26:04,939 --> 05:26:20,490
has it somebody stop him stop this fucking gator you're watching too much tiktok i don't have i

1151
05:26:20,490 --> 05:26:32,659
don't have tiktok guys i'm not even signed into youtube i watch youtube shorts until i fuck up

1152
05:26:32,659 --> 05:26:38,900
my entire algorithm to to the point where it's just just wacky wacko shit and then i have to

1153
05:26:38,900 --> 05:26:44,740
clear all my search history and all my fucking browser history on it so i reset the algorithm

1154
05:26:44,740 --> 05:26:54,540
again and then it gets all fucked up again in like 20 minutes yeah and it's even worse when

1155
05:26:54,540 --> 05:27:04,299
you reset the algorithm it's even worse for like 10 minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes and then you go

1156
05:27:04,299 --> 05:27:08,860
through one of these youtube shorts it's just like oh shit this was like a fucking goofy one

1157
05:27:09,580 --> 05:27:15,099
and i could have just skipped it but i was on it from the whole time i watched the whole thing

1158
05:27:15,099 --> 05:27:25,240
so now i fucked up the algorithm again one too many roll the glass down the stairs videos and

1159
05:27:25,240 --> 05:27:33,319
it's just like oh i want to see what happens and it's like oh shit ah damn it now i gotta go clear

1160
05:27:33,319 --> 05:27:45,799
the watch history again and i watch him every time i watch him the whole way through i don't watch

1161
05:27:45,799 --> 05:27:53,909
very much youtube shorts though i feel like they literally burn a hole in your brain i i i seriously

1162
05:28:08,950 --> 05:28:16,020
all right now that was supposed to be the last one oh wait and i want to do a sports one they're

1163
05:28:16,020 --> 05:28:27,990
fun wait is this football or soccer yeah no i i gotta go i want to eat something it's been a

1164
05:28:27,990 --> 05:28:38,709
little while since i've had some food is it bad is it bm if i leave now that's all bots anyways

1165
05:28:38,709 --> 05:29:20,459
you get um if you leave it's bm you have to play okay fine let's make this quick all right we got

1166
05:29:20,459 --> 05:29:44,340
we have the advantage here i'm not gonna let otter take the ball from us are we get it downfield

1167
05:29:44,979 --> 05:30:02,630
how did i not grab it what am i doing why would he oh my stamina bar is low and somehow i managed

1168
05:30:02,630 --> 05:30:29,880
to get out with that they were just pulling me in two different directions that was good

1169
05:30:29,880 --> 05:31:06,119
all right get it downfield down down down down no okay good it's all right i'm gonna rip his head

1170
05:31:12,790 --> 05:31:38,819
that's a lot of people all holding the ball like help me get that shit out of here now this is

1171
05:31:38,900 --> 05:31:52,099
interesting um i don't think the ball is technically on the ground or i don't know

1172
05:31:52,099 --> 05:32:08,900
where it is all right if we actually score after that that's gonna be awesome come on we can do it

1173
05:32:08,900 --> 05:32:18,020
that's so clutch if we do get it bunny oh so clutch get it in there you didn't think i was

1174
05:32:18,020 --> 05:32:21,220
ready for that you didn't think i was ready to catch you didn't think i was ready to catch that

1175
05:32:21,220 --> 05:32:26,020
is that what you thought did you think that oh no get it funny right there come on get it in there

1176
05:32:26,740 --> 05:32:47,430
that's a huge that's a huge deal that's one for the history books for sure how come that didn't

1177
05:32:47,430 --> 05:32:52,650
count before i think because the ball was on top of so many people that it technically was like out

1178
05:32:52,650 --> 05:33:14,979
of bounds that's my best guess oh they're pissed off now all right yeah they are not happy about

1179
05:33:14,979 --> 05:33:33,000
that stay back here right through his head no we can't just let him run away with it like this

1180
05:33:53,430 --> 05:34:29,939
yeah yep yep yep yep yeah let's go but one more two more uh that's gonna be a goal all right well

1181
05:34:30,500 --> 05:35:01,479
the game now and that is big so is this if i stop you big run it in yeah nice i like this one way

1182
05:35:01,479 --> 05:35:23,130
more than the soccer one or the hockey one all right we're all here we're all here just let

1183
05:35:23,130 --> 05:35:49,299
let somebody let somebody grab it everybody wants to be the hero of the game i'm running the stamina

1184
05:35:49,299 --> 05:35:59,380
somebody grab it we could win it right here there you go wow the juke that was unbelievable

1185
05:36:03,080 --> 05:36:12,869
he went a little too far over his head i just he knows he's coming wow that was well played

1186
05:36:12,869 --> 05:36:17,959
on both of them that was a great play for both of them it just one of them did it a little better

1187
05:36:32,040 --> 05:36:58,819

1199
05:39:44,259 --> 05:39:57,270

to do sorcery on monday uh i want to do the resident evil 4 dlc so we'll do that that if

1201
05:40:03,979 --> 05:40:18,229
that takes three or four hours maybe but that's the plan for monday i hope you start making youtube

1202
05:40:18,229 --> 05:40:27,139
shorts i want to do a youtube short where i just have a podcast microphone in front of me it's like

1203
05:40:27,139 --> 05:40:32,599
a podcast room and i'm just talking to somebody who also has like a podcast mic in front of them

1204
05:40:32,599 --> 05:40:50,119
as if this is like episode 400 i find that to be kind of funny just upload a shitload of them

1205
05:40:57,450 --> 05:41:07,380
i've seen people do that that's funny i don't have very i really don't have any plans for youtube

1206
05:41:07,380 --> 05:41:16,540
shorts maybe i remember talking to stir about how interesting the concept was and he's talked

1207
05:41:16,540 --> 05:41:28,389
about it a lot too but a youtube short for me i would want it to be i there's two kind of schools

1208
05:41:28,389 --> 05:41:34,069
of thought it's like highlight interesting things that happen on a stream but also or that's

1209
05:41:34,069 --> 05:41:44,759
something that's happened in a video but also a completely just original 30 second short video

1210
05:41:44,759 --> 05:41:49,459
then i feel like you go kind of down the rabbit hole with that and i don't know exactly how much

1211
05:41:49,459 --> 05:41:56,229
time i want to put into something like youtube shorts not really much time at all if i'm honest

1212
05:41:56,229 --> 05:42:12,970

1213
05:42:12,970 --> 05:42:21,259

1214
05:42:21,259 --> 05:42:31,750
three stages to be able to kind of not be sitting so upright when i stream and i feel pretty good i

1215
05:42:31,750 --> 05:42:37,669
feel okay usually after about six hours i kind of start to lock up a little and feel like but

1216
05:42:37,669 --> 05:42:49,220

1217
05:42:49,220 --> 05:42:56,650
i'm just sitting back into a more comfortable kind of pillowy chair and it is on the ground

1218
05:42:57,450 --> 05:43:12,700
