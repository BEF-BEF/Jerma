1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:28,039
Let me just check and see. I should have it ready to go. Alright, so this is, like I said, a compilation of videos that have been submitted, and they have been viewed, and they have been not bought by me.

2
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:42,570
So it's still a surprise, so don't worry. There are 55 videos. We're gonna watch them all. I'm gonna change the title to just green screen.

3
00:00:43,570 --> 00:01:04,280
Hopefully Cox behaves, because it looks like it's trying to not behave. Let me go like this. Alright, I believe we are ready. Here comes a Windows sound.

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:25,310
Alright, so are you ready? 55 downloads. Welcome to the green screen Encore movie experience. It should take us about an hour to an hour and a half maybe plus to get through all these.

5
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:44,420
Go to like the just chatting section, because that's kind of just what we're doing. We're just hanging out. And here we go. This first one is called Slap Tales. Slap Tales.

6
00:01:44,420 --> 00:02:06,609
Let me make sure you can hear it. Yes, you can. Let's turn this shit up though. Slap Tales. How's that sound? Good volume? Sounds like it's pretty good.

7
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:16,509
Oh boy, it is. Here we go. Slap Tales. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight? Don't fucking come at me. Don't.

8
00:02:16,509 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. That was fucking crazy. This one clip that I like was so scared that this people were gonna like continue to watch this.

9
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,860
Put on a face cam? No, no, no. Not for this. I want to see this one again. I'm sorry.

10
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:49,810
Turn it up. Okay. Here comes the next one. It's called Bathroom Battles.

11
00:03:49,810 --> 00:04:06,629
Chef Ramsay went into the men's bathroom. Can't believe it. He saw something he would never see in his entire life. You have bleach inside of the sink.

12
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,629
How will the blue team be able to recover from this? Will the red team capitalize in the women's bathroom?

13
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:24,129
I just, I couldn't believe it. She actually was trying to hurt me. There's a shotgun in the fucking bathroom. Let's tune in next time.

14
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:29,889
What the fuck is happening? Bathroom battle with Gordon Ramsay.

15
00:04:29,889 --> 00:05:21,000
Activate windows. You're using like a bootleg copy of windows? At least 10.

16
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:55,839
The bigger they are, the harder they fall. It's a second dream.

17
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,870
What the fuck?

18
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,879
What do I have to say about this? See, this is bullshit.

19
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:55,860
Guys, I don't think pineapple belongs on pizza.

20
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Tiny Dancer.

21
00:07:25,639 --> 00:08:08,259
Okay, I need a second after that. That was fucking crazy. You elongated my chin and my nose. New emote? I'm cross-eyed. What's going on here?

22
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,750
Did you do this to me or did I actually look like this?

23
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:24,610
One eye is going this way, the other eye is going the complete opposite direction. Oh man, that was fucking hilarious.

24
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:37,059
Alright, moving on. Here comes the next one. Harder, better, faster German.

25
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,629
It's just a song.

26
00:09:29,629 --> 00:10:00,830
Harder, better, faster, stronger. Never, ever, after, work is over. Make it, do it, make sense.

27
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,710
Harder, better, faster, stronger.

28
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,740
Harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

29
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Stronger, make sense.

30
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:35,110
Stronger, never, ever, work is never over.

31
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,110
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

32
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,110
Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.

33
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,110
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

34
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,110
Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.

35
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,110
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

36
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,110
Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.

37
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,110
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

38
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,110
Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.

39
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,110
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster, make sense.

40
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,110
Stronger, never, ever, after, work is never over.

41
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,110
Never over, but it is.

42
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:45,179
It's gonna be burned in my brain.

43
00:11:50,179 --> 00:12:16,940
I'm gonna see these images in my head.

44
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,039
That's a great song.

45
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,460
It's easy for you to say, you're an evil sith.

46
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,269
It's hard, but you're not.

47
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:41,639
You are my brother, Anakin. I love you.

48
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,639
I fucking hate you.

49
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:08,440
Okay, that was German Wars Episode 3.

50
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
I wanna see that.

51
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:17,429
It's easy for you to say, you're an evil sith.

52
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,860
It's hard, but you're not.

53
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:31,000
You are my brother, Anakin. I love you.

54
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I fucking hate you.

55
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,139
This is called It Streams.

56
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:47,679
I didn't wanna move here.

57
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,679
We couldn't afford to live in the old house anymore.

58
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,679
Plus the new story I'm writing is here.

59
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,679
Is the story a good one this time?

60
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,679
I'm gonna write the best book that anybody's ever read.

61
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,370
I got a really good feeling about this.

62
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:07,779
You gotta be kidding me.

63
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,779
Family hanging out.

64
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,779
Barbecue 79.

65
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:27,389
You think these are serial murders?

66
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:28,389
I don't know.

67
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,450
The first one I found dates back to the 60s.

68
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,460
The link between all these cases is the symbol.

69
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,460
The symbol is associated with a pagan deity named Baguul.

70
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:47,230
He consumes the souls of human children.

71
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,710
What does something this big before?

72
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:58,000
Christians believe that Baguul actually lived in the images themselves,

73
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and that they were gateways into his realm.

74
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
What's the matter? What's happened?

75
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
Get the kids. Pack the car.

76
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
We have to leave here now.

77
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:37,220
This is fucking...

78
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,019
That was great.

79
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:48,019
They're all waiting for the stream to start.

80
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,370
That's my favorite part.

81
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,370
This next one is called PlayerUnknown's Casino Royale Battle Royale.

82
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,870
Okay? Okay.

83
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:40,049
I didn't even fit it.

84
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,289
Just get the shit out of me.

85
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,589
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

86
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:13,329
Auto with the bonk helmet on.

87
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:21,059
That was pretty good.

88
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,299
That was pretty good.

89
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,299
This one's called Jerma's Got That.

90
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,430
Jerma's Got That.

91
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Fuck!

92
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,309
Hold on. I want to see that one.

93
00:18:54,309 --> 00:19:00,809
Hands up, man. I hear a boom.

94
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:20,579
It's that easy.

95
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:38,970
Space Channel 985.

96
00:19:38,970 --> 00:20:15,640
Walking around.

97
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,490
The walk. You got the walk.

98
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:06,339
Meow.

99
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:21,680
That was fucking awesome.

100
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:36,430
Meow.

101
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,430
How long did it take you to find...

102
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,670
How long did it take you to find me saying meow?

103
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:52,220
I wonder. I don't remember the last time I even said that word.

104
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
That was fucking great. Thank you.

105
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,079
Well, I just said it right now.

106
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,769
All right. Coming up next, we have...

107
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:05,650
I'm not sure. The Germanator.

108
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,630
I'm fucking killing both of you motherfuckers right now.

109
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:28,579
Surprise, motherfucker!

110
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:55,839
Oh, look it.

111
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:04,849
Give me that.

112
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:08,369
Come here.

113
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:23,250
Get out of the way.

114
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,740
That was just so fun.

115
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,089
That was fucking great.

116
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:43,130
This one's called Rat Groove.

117
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,710
Rat Groove.

118
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:24,079
This is pretty good.

119
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,380
Hold on.

120
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Everyone talk shit.

121
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,819
This is pretty fucking good.

122
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,180
This is legit good shit.

123
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,180
Take a look at this.

124
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,180
No, not that.

125
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,549
Not that. This.

126
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,569
This one right here.

127
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:51,579
That right there.

128
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:53,579
I took dance class.

129
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,579
And I was like, I don't know, 12.

130
00:25:55,579 --> 00:26:03,440
Oh, fuck.

131
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
God damn it.

132
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,099
No, no, no. Stop.

133
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,400
All right. This one is called Rat Heaven Karate German.

134
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:17,349
Ow, my butthole.

135
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,660
Okay.

136
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,839
Next one.

137
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,839
It's called Jerma Goes to the Museum.

138
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:55,180
Going to the museum today.

139
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,819
This is terrible.

140
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:01,769
Absolutely terrible.

141
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,769
Nothing about this is good.

142
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,660
Not one thing.

143
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,839
This is the thing I'm talking about right here.

144
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,720
I've told you guys this before.

145
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Absolute perfection.

146
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
No ifs, ands, or buts.

147
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
This right here.

148
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Is absolute perfection.

149
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:31,259
This is what it looks like up close.

150
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:38,940
From back there, this is perfect.

151
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
It's exactly what I was talking about.

152
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,140
Oh, no.

153
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,500
Oh, my God.

154
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:53,660
Fucking, what a gamer.

155
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,180
God, seriously.

156
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,490
Why would you walk around a museum like this?

157
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,240
You're like the weirdo.

158
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:18,619
Turn it up.

159
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:21,299
You have to shut this off. Shut them all off.

160
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,299
Turn your lights in your house off too.

161
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:41,079
Yes.

162
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,470
That's it.

163
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:58,869
What did you say?

164
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
Toilet water.

165
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Why do I have an ad for the second channel?

166
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:26,470
Oh, my God.

167
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,740
Coming up next is Jerma

168
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
versus Jerma.

169
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:39,609
Looks like in Smash Brothers.

170
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:46,069
I don't want to bite you.

171
00:30:46,069 --> 00:31:01,930
I don't want to.

172
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,900
What the fuck is that?

173
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
It's time for you to pay.

174
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:51,900
That was fucking hilarious.

175
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I just want to see one.

176
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Hold on.

177
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
I just want to see this right here.

178
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
What the fuck is that?

179
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
It's a recovery move.

180
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
It's fucking brilliant.

181
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,380
What the fuck is that?

182
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,380
It's time for you to pay.

183
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Everybody uses

184
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,380
the end of the stomach

185
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,380
puke sound thing.

186
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,519
Jerma Theft Auto

187
00:32:34,519 --> 00:33:10,099
is coming up next.

188
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,589
This is my house.

189
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:16,860
This is what he's here for.

190
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
He's here for money.

191
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
And he knows.

192
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,860
I got fucking 700 million bits.

193
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
He knows I have it.

194
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:47,320
What the fuck was that?

195
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,690
Hold on.

196
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,690
Wait a second.

197
00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:04,789
Jerma and Odd Michael

198
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:06,789
at the water park.

199
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,789
Why did you do this?

200
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,309
I can't.

201
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:29,530
I'm not trying to replay it.

202
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,530
I'm trying to pause.

203
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:37,670
I'm trying to pause.

204
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,739
Coming up next.

205
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:48,739
I gave special

206
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:51,050
permission

207
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,050
to somebody to make

208
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,989
a longer video.

209
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:00,809
One person has special permission.

210
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,750
You've known a lot of their videos.

211
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,750
They do a lot of great content.

212
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,750
Special permission for this next coming up.

213
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,139
I have no idea what this is.

214
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:15,139
This is nine minutes.

215
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,139
It's called compact.

216
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:24,179
It's a short film.

217
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,059
If you want to know

218
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,369
who this is, it is

219
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,989
Trust No One.

220
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,639
Trust No One. We've seen at least

221
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,639
a half dozen hilarious videos

222
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,639
from Trust No One.

223
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:43,989
You guys get the popcorn ready.

224
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:46,300
Here we go.

225
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,300
We'll probably take a pee break after this.

226
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,789
We'll see where we are.

227
00:36:50,789 --> 00:37:11,380
That was me.

228
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:47,800
Get out of the fucking way.

229
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:00,019
I killed like ten birds with one stone.

230
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:04,019
My pants almost ripped in half.

231
00:38:31,050 --> 00:39:00,090
Fucking idiot.

232
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,150
You want to fight?

233
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,460
Don't come at me.

234
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:36,360
I hate it.

235
00:40:43,929 --> 00:41:13,050
It doesn't even work.

236
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,860
Oh my god.

237
00:41:17,860 --> 00:42:00,219
Made it to the top.

238
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:13,130
Fuck you.

239
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:20,940
What?

240
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:30,599
Come on, you can do it.

241
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:55,050
You can do it.

242
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:04,579
Oh shit.

243
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:06,579
Who's your daddy?

244
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:21,239
Constant conflict.

245
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:28,280
Constant conflict.

246
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,280
Nobody use that.

247
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:45,300
You'll be in big trouble.

248
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:57,320
Holy shit.

249
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:07,110
Nobody use that.

250
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,679
What the fuck is that?

251
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:43,050
Really?

252
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:50,329
Did I make it?

253
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:08,019
I'm 30.

254
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,019
You don't get any taller?

255
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:13,159
Alright, first of all

256
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,159
that was fucking insane.

257
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,159
That was absolutely fucking unbelievable.

258
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:23,429
Thank you, trust no one

259
00:46:23,429 --> 00:46:25,429
for your full on

260
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:27,429
ten minute short film.

261
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:39,260
That was so good.

262
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
Academy Award nominee for short film

263
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,760
in 2019.

264
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,760
In the literal sense too.

265
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:55,929
Alright, let me see something real quick.

266
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:58,170
I want to see where we are in the

267
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,170
playlist.

268
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,920
I don't want any spoilers here.

269
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,920
We're almost

270
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,289
at halfway.

271
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,289
We'll do another five or six more and

272
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:12,300
we'll go pee.

273
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,300
There's probably a couple more.

274
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,469
We'll be almost at the halfway mark.

275
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:20,940
This next one is called

276
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,940
Germ of the Celery Man.

277
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:34,059
Good morning, Paul.

278
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,059
What will your first sequence of the day be?

279
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,059
Computer load up Celery Man, please.

280
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,059
Yes, Paul.

281
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:53,239
Could you

282
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,239
kick up the 43...

283
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,239
D3...

284
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,039
Alright.

285
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:12,039
Here comes the Germba 95 anime

286
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:14,280
opening?

287
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:38,460
Here we go.

288
00:48:38,460 --> 00:49:48,500
Not even my real name.

289
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,269
Why do we...

290
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:15,269
What is this?

291
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:17,269
You still don't seem to get it, so maybe I just need to spell it out for you more clearly.

292
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:19,269
See, you have no chances

293
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,269
of beating me. None whatsoever.

294
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,269
Zip, zilch, serum.

295
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:25,269
No matter how hard you try, there's simply no

296
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:27,269
version of this fight where you come out on top.

297
00:50:27,269 --> 00:50:29,269
Sorry, no dice.

298
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,269
You sure are talking a lot. Oh, look at me.

299
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:33,269
You know that? No, I didn't do it right.

300
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:49,400
Who would have ever thought

301
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,400
it'd be this ridiculously easy

302
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
for me to make a fool out of myself?

303
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:24,119
What?

304
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,119
Did you really think something like that was going to work on me?

305
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,119
This is a move made up by a little kid.

306
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,119
You're getting pretty desperate if that's the best you've got.

307
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,119
I just shit my pants.

308
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:34,119
I can't do it anymore.

309
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,119
So what to do now?

310
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:46,539
Hmm.

311
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:48,539
What are you waiting for? Get your act together already.

312
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,539
Ten seconds.

313
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:52,539
I'll give you that long to say your prayers.

314
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,539
Or whatever it is you need to do, then I'll blast you to hell.

315
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:56,539
Okay.

316
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:59,159
Here I go.

317
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:05,369
I can't just do it.

318
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:07,369
I can't just do it.

319
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:09,369
You are into a corner, there's only one thing to do.

320
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:11,369
So just do it.

321
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,369
Interesting thought process.

322
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,369
Not my head!

323
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:42,519
You're the one who should be saved.

324
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:52,219
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:54,219
This is really important.

326
00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:56,219
You need to understand something.

327
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,219
This is a doctored image.

328
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:00,460
This is not even my head.

329
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:07,159
This is not my head.

330
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,159
Where is it?

331
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:12,679
Interesting thought process.

332
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:14,980
That's not my head.

333
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,440
That's not the top of my head.

334
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,809
That's a Photoshop job.

335
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:26,699
Look.

336
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:35,579
Where am I?

337
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,219
That's not the top of my head.

338
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:42,809
You understand?

339
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:54,650
Don't believe the lies.

340
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,039
Nice wig.

341
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:00,539
Okay, break.

342
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:03,800
Coming up next is...

343
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,800
Bizarre Adventure.

344
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:15,320
Here we go!

345
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:00,489
No!

346
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:34,460
That was really good.

347
00:55:34,460 --> 00:56:07,610
That was really good.

348
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,610
Hold on.

349
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,610
We don't want to get any spoilers.

350
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,610
I keep fucking going to this.

351
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,420
I don't want any spoilers.

352
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,690
Alright.

353
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,820
Let's take a quick pee break.

354
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:28,440
I'll see you guys in like two minutes.

355
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
We're at pretty much the halfway point.

356
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
There is more to see.

357
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,539
I gotta get some water or something.

358
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:39,539
My face is starting to hurt.

359
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:41,539
See you guys in like two minutes, three minutes.

360
00:56:44,039 --> 00:59:46,619
I'm back.

361
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,619
So far these have been fucking fantastic.

362
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:57,960
He's back, he's back.

363
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,960
Yeah, I'm back.

364
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,960
Alright, so coming up next, this one is called

365
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,500
Hyperdimension Germania.

366
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,659
Elbertson Breaker.

367
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:18,949
Sounds good to me.

368
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,639
Already got an interesting start.

369
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:25,860
You ready?

370
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:31,179
Three, two, one, here we go.

371
01:00:31,179 --> 01:00:33,179
Life is paint.

372
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:40,659
You're dead.

373
01:00:40,659 --> 01:01:02,039
I hate...

374
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:12,090
Jesus!

375
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:15,159
Oh no!

376
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:17,159
Please! Oh my god!

377
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:25,079
Yes!

378
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,079
Dry thunder for clean machine.

379
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:29,079
Vroom vroom!

380
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:31,079
Where's your teeth going?

381
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:49,260
Who the fuck is that guy?

382
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:56,469
What?

383
01:01:56,469 --> 01:02:06,969
I gotta say this one again.

384
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:11,900
Who the fuck is that guy?

385
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,929
This is...

386
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:22,309
I love this one.

387
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:24,309
This one is called

388
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:26,309
Images of German 985

389
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,309
Real.

390
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:31,000
Do not watch at night.

391
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Hopefully it's not night, wherever any of you are.

392
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:29,219
Which?

393
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:31,219
German Beat Undertale.

394
01:03:31,219 --> 01:04:04,440
Come here.

395
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Come here.

396
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Come here.

397
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
I'm gonna push you and you all

398
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
watch this dog shit.

399
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,440
Just get in there.

400
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:20,260
Oh Jesus!

401
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,260
Oh no!

402
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,300
I don't know!

403
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,300
What?

404
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,300
Okay.

405
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:51,750
Wait, is this a new video?

406
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:53,750
What?

407
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:08,760
I saved the world right here.

408
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:16,250
I just saved the world.

409
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,250
What?

410
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,250
Why was I in Minecraft?

411
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:27,420
Oh by the way,

412
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,420
in any of these videos

413
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:31,420
there could be some television show

414
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,420
or animated show

415
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,420
or cartoon

416
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,420
or they might just yell out

417
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,420
a spoiler for your favorite show.

418
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,420
Somebody may have been watching that

419
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,420
in the middle of that game.

420
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,420
Just be aware that if you see a show

421
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,420
that you've been watching or that you will watch

422
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,719
just go to the bathroom or something

423
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:55,460
and come back.

424
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,460
Germando.

425
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:10,329
This is a 2018 trailer for Germando.

426
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:21,769
I want your kid back.

427
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,769
Then you gotta cooperate.

428
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:25,769
Right? Wrong.

429
01:06:25,769 --> 01:06:27,769
Now

430
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:29,769
somewhere

431
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:31,769
somehow

432
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:33,769
someone's gonna pay.

433
01:06:33,769 --> 01:06:43,030
Do you think that he is going

434
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,030
to give us any problems?

435
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,030
Move up in smoke!

436
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:49,030
Do exactly as he's told.

437
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,030
Hasta luego, fellas.

438
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,030
You're free, guys.

439
01:06:53,030 --> 01:06:55,030
I'm going to kill you last.

440
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,030
Are you going to tell me what's going on or what?

441
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,030
No.

442
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,030
He's dead. He's gone.

443
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:03,030
But it was not informed about this.

444
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:05,340
Are you trying to do this all by yourself?

445
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,340
I think you know what I'm going to do probably.

446
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:14,010
Do you eat ass?

447
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,010
The answer is no.

448
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:18,010
I do not eat ass.

449
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:27,610
Why?

450
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:35,929
It's a mission

451
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,929
no man can survive.

452
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,929
I'm sorry.

453
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:44,340
Schwarzenegger here with a Team Fortress 2

454
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,340
gameplay commentary.

455
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:21,369
I'm the captain now.

456
01:08:21,369 --> 01:08:23,670
Interesting thought process.

457
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,670
Look at me! Look at me!

458
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,510
That's what you sound like.

459
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:31,510
Roger, stop the tow.

460
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,350
Loot get!

461
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,350
He's blind to the watch!

462
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,350
What?

463
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:12,140
I'm seeing stars.

464
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,439
Hold on.

465
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:17,579
If you've never seen

466
01:09:17,579 --> 01:09:19,579
that movie

467
01:09:19,579 --> 01:09:21,579
just be aware

468
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:23,579
that you might

469
01:09:23,579 --> 01:09:25,579
have seen the whole thing.

470
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:29,930
God damn it.

471
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:39,909
What the fuck?

472
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,909
There was so much going on there.

473
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:43,909
There was so much stupid shit

474
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:49,289
that he'd put...

475
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,289
I need a minute.

476
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:53,289
I was literally seeing white specks

477
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,779
in my vision.

478
01:09:55,779 --> 01:10:06,979
That was fucked.

479
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:08,979
No, it's because I was out of air.

480
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:10,979
I was laughing

481
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,979
a lot.

482
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:14,979
The face with my...

483
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:16,979
It was too much for my brain.

484
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,260
German is the captain now

485
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,760
and now we're gonna move on to

486
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,060
Sonic the Hedgehog

487
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,369
live action Sonic the Hedgehog

488
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:37,369
official reveal or something.

489
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:49,340
That's what you sound like.

490
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,390
Ow.

491
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:12,670
That's what you sound like.

492
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:34,500
Ooh, up in smoke.

493
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:57,090
Oh shit, another witness.

494
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:59,090
This is a pretty good beach party.

495
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,090
What's that guy doing?

496
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh no, they're killing each other.

497
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:08,029
Give me that shotgun.

498
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:10,029
Shoot him with the shotgun.

499
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,140
Get out of the fucking way.

500
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:28,439
That's a new subject.

501
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:31,510
We need to take up the back.

502
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,510
We need to send in our music first.

503
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,510
We need to send in the pipes first.

504
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,119
This is the best part right here.

505
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,119
Okay, we are clear.

506
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,470
Houston, we have list off.

507
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:30,819
Watch out for that asshole.

508
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:35,869
I knew it was coming too and it scared me.

509
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:41,380
That was fucking awesome.

510
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:46,050
That was fucking great.

511
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:51,960
You guys are fucking awesome.

512
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,960
Alright, Jerva gets into a fight.

513
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,220
Let's see how this one plays out.

514
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:58,260
My favorite part is

515
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,260
like I said before

516
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:02,260
into the stomach puke.

517
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,260
I got hit during

518
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,260
that green screen when I was

519
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,819
in front of it. I took like

520
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:10,819
in the shoulder, in the back

521
01:17:10,819 --> 01:17:12,819
the ten different injuries into the stomach.

522
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:15,960
But everybody

523
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,960
just uses the puke and I think that's

524
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,199
I love that because there's so many other

525
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:23,340
options. Do we always

526
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,340
see this one? I don't remember.

527
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,340
This Jerva's in the kitchen.

528
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:47,180
Well, I'm something of a scientist myself.

529
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:53,060
What?

530
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,060
Wait, hold on.

531
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:03,939
Got faded.

532
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:05,939
That was not one we have seen.

533
01:18:05,939 --> 01:18:08,699
This is called Late Night Weatherman

534
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,699
Jerva 985 Green Screen Movie Night.

535
01:18:10,699 --> 01:18:15,050
Here we go.

536
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:35,579
That's just a big old soap

537
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:38,069
if you know what I'm saying.

538
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:40,069
Fuck this Jerva.

539
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:42,069
You know typically I bring you the weather

540
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:44,069
but today I want to show you something

541
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:46,069
different. I want to show you

542
01:18:46,069 --> 01:18:48,069
something that I care about.

543
01:18:48,069 --> 01:18:50,069
Something that I want to show.

544
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:52,069
That I haven't been having on. I had no opportunity to do it till now.

545
01:18:52,069 --> 01:18:58,899
Diane

546
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:00,899
that's my son. I just wanted to show

547
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:04,619
her. I don't know.

548
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:17,399
And Diane go fuck show business.

549
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:20,220
That was fucking awesome.

550
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:38,010
This is part one

551
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:53,500
coming up. Wait,

552
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
hold on. Did you guys hear me? Was I muted?

553
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,859
Oh, I'm sorry. I was muted.

554
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,859
I said this might be a, if you've never

555
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:02,359
seen a television show, just, I don't know.

556
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:11,050
Get spoiled.

557
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,930
Go fuck yourself.

558
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:40,520
Now that's funny.

559
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,520
That doesn't make any sense.

560
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,520
It's funny because it's Jero-Jero.

561
01:20:56,229 --> 01:21:05,829
I don't have very much to say

562
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:07,829
right now. Besides, here comes

563
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,710
Jerva Blanca.

564
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:19,609
Fuck you.

565
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:42,779
Fuck you.

566
01:21:42,779 --> 01:22:04,460
What?

567
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,210
What is that? What just happened?

568
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:12,460
Why?

569
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,460
Why? What?

570
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,460
Don't forget about me. The newest turtle.

571
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,460
Socrates. I may be small

572
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:20,460
but I sure got lots of power.

573
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:23,399
I trust you correctly. I slash

574
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:25,399
those buddies like nobody's business.

575
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,399
Check me out.

576
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:29,399
You'll see a little bit of footage right here.

577
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:52,119
Don't touch it.

578
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:57,430
Don't touch it.

579
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:02,939
Don't touch it.

580
01:23:02,939 --> 01:23:11,899
Spoilers

581
01:23:11,899 --> 01:23:13,899
for every movie

582
01:23:13,899 --> 01:23:17,159
ever made.

583
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:19,159
The climax of every movie.

584
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:25,369
In case you were wondering.

585
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:43,140
What a god

586
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,140
of a gamer, seriously.

587
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:49,619
Slow go-

588
01:23:49,619 --> 01:23:51,930
Knock, knock. Who's there?

589
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:56,149
Hi. Hi. Hi.

590
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:59,739
Hi.

591
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:23,979
You're a scientist.

592
01:24:23,979 --> 01:25:00,460
Relaxing or like I'm being

593
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,460
tortured in a dungeon.

594
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:08,090
It could be both. I think it works

595
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:28,380
for both.

596
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:38,550
That was pretty good though.

597
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:41,109
Next meme.

598
01:25:41,109 --> 01:25:44,180
That's true.

599
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,180
Jerva plays- Jerva plays

600
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:50,340
Lobotomy Corporation.

601
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:52,899
I never did this.

602
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:55,270
This is the chat. Jerva went

603
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,899
and he actually went live.

604
01:25:57,899 --> 01:26:02,180
What? I'm actually

605
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:04,180
really, really, really curious about this one.

606
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:41,100
Let's go.

607
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:43,100
I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it.

608
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,800
What a reference. What a

609
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,420
callback.

610
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,180
Here's the Nintendo Direct.

611
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:29,020
Did you make this?

612
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:36,119
Why is this here? Fortnite.

613
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:44,250
The gates to the burning

614
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,250
walls will open on Nintendo Switch.

615
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,739
Of course, we're talking

616
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:50,739
about Diablo 3.

617
01:27:50,739 --> 01:27:52,739
The dark fantasy adventure that may just

618
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:54,739
consume your life both inside and

619
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:56,739
outside the game world.

620
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,739
Play as a demon hunter, barbarian,

621
01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:00,739
crusader, necromancer,

622
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:02,739
witch doctor, monk

623
01:28:02,739 --> 01:28:04,739
or wizard. Diablo 3

624
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:06,739
Eternal Collection invades

625
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,739
Nintendo Switch on November 2.

626
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:12,649
We're making this

627
01:28:12,649 --> 01:28:18,279
party super.

628
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:20,279
Wait, I can catch that in midair? Are you kidding me?

629
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:22,279
That's going to be a fucking highlight reel. Watch this.

630
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:25,479
Alright. I'm ready.

631
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:27,479
Okay. I'm going to catch

632
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:36,250
it in my mouth. What is that?

633
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:55,029
Here it comes.

634
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:59,369
You got me. You got me.

635
01:28:59,369 --> 01:29:01,369
You got me.

636
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:07,079
We have to be getting... No, don't sleep on the

637
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:09,079
turnbuckle again.

638
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:12,010
No.

639
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:14,010
I fucking hated this so much.

640
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:17,079
When that crashed...

641
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:19,079
That was the worst thing ever when it happened.

642
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,770
Official Blu-ray 2019

643
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,770
trailer HD2108P

644
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,770
IMDB... What's the title of this?

645
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:42,390
Does this have a title?

646
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:44,390
I died like 25 years

647
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:51,029
ago and I'm just in the house.

648
01:29:51,029 --> 01:29:53,029
I wish I had the time and money to be able to go

649
01:29:53,029 --> 01:29:55,029
anywhere I wanted to go.

650
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:06,359
And I've been going crazy, guys.

651
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,239
I've been losing my mind.

652
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:27,479
What the hell is going on?

653
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:30,739
We don't fucking choose sides.

654
01:30:30,739 --> 01:30:32,739
25 non-smoker. When am I going to...

655
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:34,739
What's my death clock here?

656
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:36,739
Friday, July 4th, 2019.

657
01:30:36,739 --> 01:31:00,939
Is this what you fucking

658
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:04,579
wanted?

659
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:07,140
The best thing

660
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,699
about this is

661
01:31:09,699 --> 01:31:12,460
that could seriously have been

662
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,890
any trailer

663
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,890
in the last 5 to 10 years.

664
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:23,029
It was perfect. Comes out today.

665
01:31:23,029 --> 01:31:25,270
Well, there you go.

666
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:30,649
Hope it's good.

667
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:34,039
The best thing about

668
01:31:34,039 --> 01:31:36,039
going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.

669
01:31:36,039 --> 01:31:40,840
Wait till he lands.

670
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,210
Interesting

671
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,210
thought process. Look at me!

672
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:47,210
Look at me! That's what you sound like.

673
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:54,300
Look at me!

674
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,300
What does that say?

675
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,300
This stream sucks.

676
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,300
Hey, fellas!

677
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:05,989
Ooh, up in smoke!

678
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:12,010
You're right on time, detectives.

679
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:14,010
It appears that the victim

680
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:16,010
was burned alive after

681
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:18,010
flying into the suspect's office

682
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,010
last night. We haven't located

683
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,010
any witnesses and there doesn't seem

684
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:24,010
to be any source coin for the fire.

685
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,010
Almost as if they suddenly

686
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:28,010
combusted it.

687
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:30,010
Well, you know what they say.

688
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,010
Smoke him if he got him.

689
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:43,979
Why? There's been two of those.

690
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:51,590
I love this.

691
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:54,020
Alright, coming up next.

692
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,020
We have Jerma's fantastic

693
01:32:56,020 --> 01:33:01,000
journey.

694
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Looks like we've got a potential balloon

695
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,840
video here.

696
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:52,939
That was

697
01:33:52,939 --> 01:33:54,939
cute. That was cute.

698
01:33:54,939 --> 01:33:56,939
That was really cute. I like that one.

699
01:33:56,939 --> 01:33:58,939
This is the best TV news

700
01:33:58,939 --> 01:34:00,939
blooper fails. I think

701
01:34:00,939 --> 01:34:02,939
this is an encore of an encore

702
01:34:02,939 --> 01:34:04,939
just in case people didn't see this one because

703
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,939
this is great. I believe

704
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:08,939
this is another one that we have seen before, maybe?

705
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:13,399
Here we go.

706
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:17,399
An occupational hazard while shooting a story can be

707
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:19,399
he was standing beside a skate ramp

708
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:21,399
when this happened.

709
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:29,399
Just take eight double

710
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:31,399
stuffed Oreos and put them in a glass.

711
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:33,399
Fill it up with milk and eat it with a spoon.

712
01:34:33,399 --> 01:34:35,399
The Ninja Turtle, Michelangelo,

713
01:34:35,399 --> 01:34:37,399
made an appearance

714
01:34:37,399 --> 01:34:39,399
in July.

715
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:41,399
To draw attention

716
01:34:41,399 --> 01:34:43,399
to our collection of Burke

717
01:34:43,399 --> 01:34:46,600
Oreos.

718
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,600
Come on now.

719
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:00,470
I mean, come on.

720
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:02,470
Look at him.

721
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:05,159
He looks

722
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:07,159
really pleased to be there.

723
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:09,159
Wow, that was really dramatic.

724
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:11,159
There's a reason they call these people

725
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:13,159
heroes. I mean,

726
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:15,159
they were going at a really good clip there.

727
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:17,159
We've had some hot weather, I guess.

728
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:19,159
Yes.

729
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:21,159
That's right.

730
01:35:21,159 --> 01:35:23,159
Send something, please.

731
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:25,159
Baltimore Ravens running back.

732
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:27,159
Ray Rice breaks his silence today, apologizing

733
01:35:27,159 --> 01:35:29,159
to his wife and his fans for the allegations

734
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:31,159
that he attacked his wife, knocking her

735
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:33,159
unconscious in a casino

736
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:35,529
elevator this last February.

737
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:37,529
They're trading back and forth. Blue

738
01:35:37,529 --> 01:35:39,529
men and German. Blue men and German.

739
01:35:39,529 --> 01:35:41,529
Wait a minute. That is not the right

740
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:43,529
video, but Rice has been

741
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:45,529
suspended.

742
01:35:47,529 --> 01:35:49,529
Scandals happen all the time.

743
01:35:49,529 --> 01:35:51,529
The question is how do democracies respond

744
01:35:51,529 --> 01:35:53,529
to those scandals?

745
01:35:53,529 --> 01:35:55,529
And what will it mean for

746
01:35:55,529 --> 01:35:57,529
the wider region? I think one of your

747
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:59,529
children has just walked in. I mean, shifting

748
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:01,529
sands in the region. Do you think

749
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:03,529
relations with the north may change?

750
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:05,529
I would be surprised if they do.

751
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,600
Pardon me.

752
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,600
I love this one.

753
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,600
My apologies.

754
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,970
My apologies.

755
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,640
Derva opens the door.

756
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:06,659
That was sick.

757
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:29,430
Here's what I have to say about

758
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,430
this. Don't do it.

759
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,670
Don't do it.

760
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,789
Holy shit.

761
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:53,539
How it feels to chew

762
01:37:53,539 --> 01:37:55,539
five gum.

763
01:37:55,539 --> 01:37:58,359
Stimulate your

764
01:37:58,359 --> 01:38:02,840
senses.

765
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:07,960
You want to fight?

766
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:09,960
Don't come at me.

767
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:12,840
You did it.

768
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,840
You did it.

769
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,840
I got a bucket of chicken.

770
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:26,550
Don't come at me.

771
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:28,550
Don't come at me.

772
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:44,140
That's three.

773
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:50,520
That's strike three.

774
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,520
This is called

775
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,520
unfinished

776
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,520
bad coffee Cheetos chicken.

777
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:01,060
Looks pretty cool.

778
01:39:01,060 --> 01:40:21,510
Here we go.

779
01:40:43,609 --> 01:40:47,829
Let's go.

780
01:40:47,829 --> 01:41:19,130
Hey, man! Welcome to the stream!

781
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:24,489
All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. So that was pretty well done. That was pretty well done.

782
01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:30,810
This is also 8 minutes and 41 seconds, you're noticing. This is Kewo's. I believe these are

783
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:37,880
Kewo's edits. For those of you that don't know Kewo, she's hilarious, really talented, really

784
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:43,750
funny person, and obviously wanted to show these. We did watch them before,

785
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:48,260
like maybe a couple months back. I'm not sure we watched them all, though.

786
01:41:50,149 --> 01:41:59,699
So a couple people get some extra time, but I did want to show these, so here we go.

787
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:05,560
My name's Jerma, nice to meet you. Right there, bingo! Right there, that's the follow button.

788
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:08,979
If you click that, every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming.

789
01:42:09,619 --> 01:42:12,979
And I do lots of fun things on this stream, like...

790
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:19,109
Wait, what? I just get like an ad. That's the first ad I see.

791
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:26,550
I thought that was in the video for a second. I was like, I don't remember that being in

792
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:33,609
the video. All right, let's go again. Welcome to the stream. My name's Jerma,

793
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:37,050
nice to meet you. Right there, bingo! Right there, that's the follow button. If you click that,

794
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:42,810
every so often you're getting notified that I'm streaming. And I do lots of fun things on this

795
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:51,479
stream, like playing Hitman. We played that last night. That's it, it's right there.

796
01:42:53,880 --> 01:43:12,779
You should have acted. They're already here. The Elder Scrolls told of their return.

797
01:43:15,699 --> 01:43:23,130
Their defeat was merely a delay for the time after Oblivion opened,

798
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,779
when the Sons of Skyrim would spill their own blood.

799
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:45,739
No one wanted to believe, believe they even existed. And when the truth finally dawned,

800
01:43:46,300 --> 01:44:04,149
it dawned in fire. But one that in their tongue is Dovahkiin, Dragonborn.

801
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:12,409
What's happening to our city, Yuri? I don't know.

802
01:44:12,409 --> 01:44:15,399
Feels like the end of the world. Maybe it is.

803
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:23,560
Peter Parker, how the hell are- Absolutely terrible.

804
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:28,439
The city is in danger. We need our help. All of our help.

805
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:35,000
Fuck you. Gang of costume nutjobs is taking the city apart piece by piece.

806
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,159
Eat your vegetables and fruits too.

807
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:47,899
This is opportunity knocking. You know the closer you get to them, the more you become a-

808
01:44:49,659 --> 01:44:52,359
Closer I get, the better chance we have to stop them.

809
01:44:52,359 --> 01:44:53,720
You're a scientist.

810
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:57,159
I've ordered Silver Sable and her team to shoot you on sight.

811
01:44:58,039 --> 01:45:01,029
Hey, Yuri!

812
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:03,029
This city's had enough of your vigilante-

813
01:45:06,069 --> 01:45:06,569
Cool.

814
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:25,100
I'm something of a scientist myself.

815
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,180
It's time for you to pay!

816
01:45:27,899 --> 01:45:28,779
Oh my god.

817
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:47,340
So why do you question for a real honest me?

818
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,140
Yeah!

819
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,000
Yeah!

820
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:22,779
Mom, I see it!

821
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,159
I'm gonna die.

822
01:46:38,539 --> 01:46:46,539
Me getting killed.

823
01:47:07,949 --> 01:47:11,149
It's like not being that bad of a lightsaber, you die instantly.

824
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:13,229
You wouldn't even get out of the academy.

825
01:47:29,739 --> 01:47:30,239
Oh no.

826
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:55,420
Shit screams hack.

827
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:55,920
Yeah!

828
01:48:39,789 --> 01:48:40,750
Kingdom Hearts.

829
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:24,039
With the steering wheel.

830
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:41,840
Fire?

831
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:49,010
Water.

832
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,300
Fire.

833
01:49:57,210 --> 01:50:00,409
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

834
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:04,409
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

835
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:38,649
What? What the fuck is that?

836
01:50:41,689 --> 01:50:42,689
Great.

837
01:50:44,729 --> 01:50:54,039
Oh, the emotes!

838
01:50:54,039 --> 01:51:06,619
That's cool.

839
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:17,229
So, that was all QWO, by the way.

840
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:19,550
Until we just got to the next one here.

841
01:51:23,789 --> 01:51:28,270
I'm trying not to just like be a cackling psycho over these, so muting sometimes.

842
01:51:30,779 --> 01:51:31,500
Oh man.

843
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:33,739
I think we're getting close to the end though.

844
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:40,170
Don't mute. Don't mute.

845
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:41,369
Well, I haven't been muting that much.

846
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:49,000
But yeah, that was all QWO.

847
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,640
So, I think we only have maybe a handful more.

848
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:53,159
Like five or six more, maybe?

849
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:53,640
I'm not sure.

850
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:57,020
But here we go.

851
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:59,500
This is Ultra Compact Dream Streamer.

852
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:24,890
This is really good.

853
01:52:25,609 --> 01:52:26,489
This is really good.

854
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:39,020
This is New York.

855
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:43,180
Peter in New York City, but 50% of its population is germos.

856
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:45,229
Oh god.

857
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,479
Peter, I hear you.

858
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:53,199
Why designs it?

859
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,199
Well, I have something in the socks.

860
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:03,100
I got it right there.

861
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:19,020
Crying.

862
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:42,260
Asshole.

863
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:48,350
My face!

864
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:51,760
Why are we all psychos?

865
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,479
Why are we all like fucking NPCs with like our aggression turned up to 100?

866
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:05,149
Oh, I need to see this one again.

867
01:54:06,109 --> 01:54:09,069
Why? Like there's one of them hiding behind the taxi?

868
01:54:09,949 --> 01:54:10,670
Holy shit.

869
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:11,630
That was fucking funny.

870
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,279
Again.

871
01:54:17,529 --> 01:54:20,880
Peter, I hear you.

872
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,680
Why designs it?

873
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:23,680
Well, I have something in the socks.

874
01:54:29,149 --> 01:54:31,550
I got it right there.

875
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:33,550
That's my guy right there.

876
01:54:34,350 --> 01:54:34,850
Yeah.

877
01:54:46,119 --> 01:54:47,800
We're all so like fucked up.

878
01:55:06,569 --> 01:55:08,010
I didn't want to knock you up.

879
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,439
Why would they be in a fight?

880
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:16,640
There's no reason.

881
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:17,760
They didn't do anything.

882
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:31,840
Hold on.

883
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,079
Jesus Christ.

884
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,680
My fucking head is killing me right now.

885
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:48,640
Hold on.

886
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,800
Give me one second.

887
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:15,770
Okay.

888
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:16,170
I'm back.

889
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:18,810
Holy shit.

890
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:22,220
It's just...

891
01:56:25,579 --> 01:56:26,300
This is perfect.

892
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,489
I think we're at the end.

893
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:32,319
Here comes the...

894
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,600
I think this is the last video on the list.

895
01:56:39,869 --> 01:56:41,229
End of the movie night voice.

896
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:49,600
Oh, this is number 56 or 57, I think.

897
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:52,829
So here we go.

898
01:56:56,859 --> 01:56:59,399
Happy eighth anniversary.

899
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:03,050
It's been eight years.

900
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:10,590
What Evo is that?

901
01:58:10,590 --> 01:58:11,229
Oh, that's...

902
01:58:11,229 --> 01:58:11,949
Is that Mars?

903
01:58:11,949 --> 01:58:12,109
No.

904
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:38,300
Oh, look.

905
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:39,180
Viva Los Reyes.

906
01:58:53,479 --> 01:58:56,270
Thank you for that.

907
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:56,989
Oh my god.

908
01:58:57,789 --> 01:59:02,329
It's my pleasure.

909
01:59:02,329 --> 01:59:05,279
It's been an eventful eight years.

910
01:59:09,180 --> 01:59:12,510
And that is going to take us to the end.

911
01:59:13,069 --> 01:59:16,279
We're getting a shitload of community subs are coming in.

912
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,859
Bingo Sunshine, thanks for five.

913
01:59:18,859 --> 01:59:21,420
Great Canadian Frick Club, thanks for ten.

914
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,460
Gnarly, thanks for five.

915
01:59:25,609 --> 01:59:26,810
Oh, man.

916
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:38,840
That was the encore presentation of green screen footage.

917
01:59:42,859 --> 01:59:43,420
Oh, man.

918
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,039
I'm like a broken record now.

919
01:59:46,039 --> 01:59:46,600
Oh, man.

920
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:47,319
Oh, jeez.

921
01:59:47,319 --> 01:59:47,720
Oh, man.

922
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:51,770
My head is fucking flying around in circles right now.

923
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,770
Kazzy, thanks for the five community subs.

924
01:59:57,770 --> 02:00:01,210
And yeah, it actually, like last week or something,

925
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:04,250
was eight years on Twitch and YouTube combined.

926
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:06,520
It's been a long time.

927
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:10,039
I want to just thank everybody for all the awesome shit that they made.

928
02:00:10,039 --> 02:00:11,560
If your video didn't make it through,

929
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,760
that doesn't mean it wasn't any good.

930
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,720
I just wanted to condense this down to like a couple hours.

931
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,239
Like one to two hours.

932
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:25,079
So the playlist, I think, let me make sure there's that.

933
02:00:25,079 --> 02:00:25,800
There might be one.

934
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:26,760
There might be another one.

935
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:27,640
Let me see.

936
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:32,640
Let's just check the playlist to see just in case something was added.

937
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:33,199
No, that's it.

938
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:36,750
So I got the playlist.

939
02:00:38,489 --> 02:00:39,770
It will be publiced.

940
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:41,210
It's not going to be unlisted.

941
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:45,229
Grump is publishing this right now.

942
02:00:45,229 --> 02:00:48,510
Here is the playlist if you'd like to watch everything that was there.

943
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:55,199
You guys surprise me every single day with your creativity

944
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:58,239
and how fucking funny and interesting the shit you put together is.

945
02:01:01,369 --> 02:01:04,649
All I could do this stream is just enjoy it.

946
02:01:04,649 --> 02:01:09,500
So thank you for all these awesome videos and thanks for participating.

947
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,020
Here is a link to the playlist.

948
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:17,550
That is the current playlist.

949
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:18,510
55 videos.

950
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:20,109
It's about an hour and 20 minutes.

951
02:01:20,109 --> 02:01:21,470
Hour and 10 minutes or so.

952
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:32,090
So I am going to, I'm probably going to call it early

953
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:34,890
because I have seriously like slapped myself

954
02:01:34,890 --> 02:01:39,770
into like an even worse headache than I had like an hour ago.

955
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:43,760
So I'm probably going to have to call it early.

956
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,720
But what's today?

957
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:52,220
Today is Saturday that I will see you guys.

958
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:55,319
Let me see here.

959
02:01:55,319 --> 02:01:59,689
Today is Saturday.

960
02:02:00,569 --> 02:02:02,170
I got some work to do on the carnival.

961
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:03,609
So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

962
02:02:03,609 --> 02:02:04,409
We'll do Tuesday.

963
02:02:07,069 --> 02:02:10,109
I am like, my like sensory overload here is

964
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,489
that last New York City one.

965
02:02:14,489 --> 02:02:15,050
Holy shit.

966
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:17,850
I almost died.

967
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:18,250
The what?

968
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:21,600
Oh, if you don't know, I'll be talking about it a lot more

969
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:22,880
over the next few weeks.

970
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:26,170
But there's going to be a Twitch controlled robot carnival stream

971
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:29,869
that is going to be on the stream within the next couple of months.

972
02:02:29,869 --> 02:02:32,270
And I kind of have to dial back streams to work on it.

973
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:35,819
So it should be a lot of fun.

974
02:02:35,819 --> 02:02:37,399
So I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

975
02:02:37,399 --> 02:02:38,439
I'm going to just take a quick break.

976
02:02:38,439 --> 02:02:41,159
I'm going to grab a water and we'll come back

977
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,159
and do the bits and the subs and everything.

978
02:02:43,159 --> 02:02:47,390
But thank you so much for being part of this community.

979
02:02:47,390 --> 02:02:51,470
And if you just watch, if you make this kind of shit, thank you.

980
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:52,670
I love every second of it.

981
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:56,960
So I will be right back.

982
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,329
I'm going to like throw some water in my face

983
02:03:00,329 --> 02:03:03,210
and we'll continue for another like probably 20, 30 minutes.

984
02:03:03,210 --> 02:04:51,899
I'll be right back.

985
02:04:51,899 --> 02:04:53,659
Okay, I am back.

986
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:00,960
Let us get to the end here.

987
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,100
Stream is over.

988
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,539
Well, kind of.

989
02:05:08,539 --> 02:05:11,180
Let's do the bits.

990
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:12,699
I also want to do the credits too.

991
02:05:13,869 --> 02:05:16,029
We had a shitload of community subs tonight.

992
02:05:16,029 --> 02:05:17,949
Oh, like so many.

993
02:05:17,949 --> 02:05:19,550
Like more than at least a few hundred probably.

994
02:05:20,909 --> 02:05:22,590
At least two to three hundred subs tonight.

995
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:28,270
So that's a fucking entire like baseball stadium full of people.

996
02:05:29,310 --> 02:05:30,430
Well, I mean, not really.

997
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:32,989
If there was 200 people at a baseball game, it'd probably be.

998
02:05:34,029 --> 02:05:34,510
Well, whatever.

999
02:05:34,510 --> 02:05:35,789
It's our baseball stadium.

1000
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:43,609
It's a little league stadium.

1001
02:05:43,609 --> 02:05:47,050
Yeah, 250 people showed up to a little league game.

1002
02:05:47,689 --> 02:05:48,010
Wow.

1003
02:05:48,010 --> 02:05:49,050
That's a, that's huge.

1004
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:55,659
But thanks again, regardless, everybody.

1005
02:05:55,659 --> 02:05:56,539
All the community subs.

1006
02:05:56,539 --> 02:05:59,100
Let's go back to earlier today.

1007
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:05,149
We had trust no one gave two dollars and fifty cents.

1008
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:09,930
Awesome, awesome job.

1009
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:10,489
Trust no one.

1010
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:14,170
It was a hell of a job.

1011
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:16,649
They say the movie night is finally over.

1012
02:06:16,729 --> 02:06:20,090
But my green screen videos playlist is not.

1013
02:06:20,090 --> 02:06:23,369
After a rich dinner, let's have some sweet desserts.

1014
02:06:23,369 --> 02:06:25,210
It will last less than 10 minutes.

1015
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:25,850
Don't worry.

1016
02:06:26,649 --> 02:06:27,850
Love to you, dad.

1017
02:06:27,850 --> 02:06:28,569
Love to chat.

1018
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:33,520
Green screen movie encore night desserts.

1019
02:06:39,979 --> 02:06:41,020
We got desserts.

1020
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:48,649
Oh man, we've got some desserts.

1021
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:52,520
Okay.

1022
02:06:53,239 --> 02:07:04,729
This is trust no one.

1023
02:07:06,029 --> 02:07:10,829
Made of that insanely awesome nine minute full short movie.

1024
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:16,270
We're going to get the after credit scene here then.

1025
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:21,289
Why not?

1026
02:07:21,289 --> 02:07:21,529
Right?

1027
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:24,079
I'm going to get it on the screen.

1028
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:26,939
Here are the desserts.

1029
02:07:27,739 --> 02:07:31,720
These are all by trust no one.

1030
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:33,000
Less than 10 minutes or so here.

1031
02:07:35,529 --> 02:07:38,729
We will continue with the bits after this, but this is truly like me.

1032
02:07:38,729 --> 02:07:40,170
If we're here, let's do it.

1033
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:51,579
I just need to make this bigger.

1034
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:56,220
Here we go.

1035
02:07:57,079 --> 02:07:58,119
This is chat.

1036
02:07:58,119 --> 02:07:59,640
Jermis chat during a stream.

1037
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:04,590
I will link this playlist as well.

1038
02:08:22,859 --> 02:08:24,460
These were the final levels.

1039
02:08:28,109 --> 02:08:28,590
Oh, what?

1040
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:32,319
Good.

1041
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,930
Kill him.

1042
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:39,119
Kill him now.

1043
02:08:39,119 --> 02:08:42,300
What the fuck?

1044
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,180
Do it.

1045
02:08:43,180 --> 02:08:55,000
Please welcome the guy who will finally be Team 71 on screen.

1046
02:08:56,039 --> 02:09:09,680
That's true.

1047
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:10,720
Life is pain.

1048
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,500
Jermis tie issue.

1049
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:20,279
I don't fucking care about this tie.

1050
02:09:21,079 --> 02:09:36,779
You are Superman, aren't you?

1051
02:09:36,779 --> 02:09:38,140
And now you have to go fuck yourself.

1052
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:42,039
Oh, my head.

1053
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:22,840
Zap.

1054
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,069
Wait, this is spoiler.

1055
02:10:41,069 --> 02:10:42,670
This is spoiler incoming.

1056
02:10:43,229 --> 02:10:45,560
This possible spoiler alert.

1057
02:10:46,199 --> 02:10:48,409
For I don't know what movie.

1058
02:10:48,409 --> 02:10:50,489
They've made like 16 of these.

1059
02:10:50,489 --> 02:10:52,479
I don't know which one.

1060
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:53,520
Just be ready.

1061
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,439
Bugs Bungie Special.

1062
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:27,920
You really fucking watching this shit?

1063
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:34,199
Oh, please.

1064
02:11:35,899 --> 02:11:37,260
Oh, my God.

1065
02:11:46,909 --> 02:11:47,470
Fuck you.

1066
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,840
Wait, this is interview.

1067
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,079
German.

1068
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:19,760
German 2019 interviewing German 2017.

1069
02:12:23,449 --> 02:12:24,010
What is this?

1070
02:12:31,899 --> 02:12:32,380
Excuse me.

1071
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:34,300
I'll excuse me like Walgreens.

1072
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:38,029
Are you here for the interview?

1073
02:12:38,029 --> 02:12:38,829
No, just sit down.

1074
02:12:38,829 --> 02:12:39,310
Sit down.

1075
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:39,869
Sit down.

1076
02:12:39,869 --> 02:12:40,750
Absolutely.

1077
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:42,140
What's your name?

1078
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:43,390
German 985.

1079
02:12:44,109 --> 02:12:45,550
Oh, I was looking at your resume.

1080
02:12:46,109 --> 02:12:47,470
I have a good resume.

1081
02:12:48,109 --> 02:12:50,029
It looks like you've got some.

1082
02:12:50,029 --> 02:12:51,789
Content creator on YouTube dot com

1083
02:12:51,789 --> 02:12:54,350
with over six, seven hundred thousand subscribers

1084
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:56,189
and over a thousand videos made.

1085
02:12:57,310 --> 02:12:58,109
Unbelievable.

1086
02:12:58,109 --> 02:12:59,229
That's really, really great.

1087
02:12:59,229 --> 02:12:59,789
Well, you know.

1088
02:13:01,319 --> 02:13:01,720
Okay.

1089
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:02,039
All right.

1090
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,840
So what is it about this company

1091
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:06,039
that you think that you can add,

1092
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:09,470
you know, some worth to?

1093
02:13:10,539 --> 02:13:11,260
I can do this.

1094
02:13:13,659 --> 02:13:14,220
I can do this.

1095
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:17,359
Do this.

1096
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:27,279
Okay.

1097
02:13:27,279 --> 02:13:28,000
Okay.

1098
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,279
Well, we're going to need a lot of that.

1099
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:31,920
So it's really, really important that you understand.

1100
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,609
I need valuable team members and.

1101
02:13:35,609 --> 02:13:36,890
Well, I can do this.

1102
02:13:36,890 --> 02:13:37,369
What's that?

1103
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:39,130
I can count to ten.

1104
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:45,119
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1105
02:13:49,689 --> 02:13:50,409
Okay.

1106
02:13:50,409 --> 02:13:52,970
Well, I don't think the position is for you.

1107
02:13:52,970 --> 02:13:54,810
The position already has been filled.

1108
02:13:54,810 --> 02:13:56,810
So what can you do?

1109
02:13:57,850 --> 02:13:59,210
Just so you know who you're dealing with.

1110
02:14:05,390 --> 02:14:06,909
Nobody used any of that.

1111
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:10,880
That's the only one that used guy at desk.

1112
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:12,800
Interviewing somebody.

1113
02:14:17,869 --> 02:14:22,270
I sat there in January 1st and I did like five of those.

1114
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:28,319
This is back to formula.

1115
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:45,770
Who is this?

1116
02:14:46,569 --> 02:14:47,050
Is this me?

1117
02:14:50,250 --> 02:15:07,960
This out.

1118
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:10,600
Why don't you do the other filming for us while I run the brand?

1119
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:12,359
I'm going to give you this camera.

1120
02:15:12,359 --> 02:15:13,159
But first, let me just say.

1121
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:16,039
Number one, don't talk.

1122
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:17,880
I'm getting the hang of it.

1123
02:15:21,359 --> 02:15:22,560
Like this guy sucks.

1124
02:15:30,359 --> 02:15:32,680
Hey, it's time to play Dark Souls Remastered.

1125
02:15:33,159 --> 02:15:33,960
What do you guys say?

1126
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,159
You ready?

1127
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:41,960
No, no, no, no.

1128
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:43,640
Damn it.

1129
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:44,119
There it is.

1130
02:15:45,239 --> 02:15:46,600
Oh, I'm fucking dead.

1131
02:15:46,600 --> 02:15:47,399
Oh, my God.

1132
02:15:47,399 --> 02:15:48,680
This guy is horrible.

1133
02:15:54,859 --> 02:15:58,109
What about peppers and cheese?

1134
02:15:58,909 --> 02:16:01,069
Is that going to work?

1135
02:16:04,359 --> 02:16:05,720
Absolutely terrible.

1136
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:08,460
Nothing about this is good.

1137
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:09,180
Not one thing.

1138
02:16:10,409 --> 02:16:11,449
God, I hate this.

1139
02:16:11,449 --> 02:16:12,329
I hate this.

1140
02:16:12,329 --> 02:16:13,050
This is terrible.

1141
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:56,409
I'm going to beat this little shit.

1142
02:16:57,049 --> 02:16:58,489
Oh, fuck.

1143
02:17:01,049 --> 02:17:01,690
Now that's a.

1144
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:04,879
Oh, oh, boy.

1145
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:07,360
It is time to say those eight magic words.

1146
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:14,110
I am not smarter than a fifth grader.

1147
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:23,559
Hey, it's Jerma from Jerma.85 and you're watching.

1148
02:17:41,639 --> 02:17:47,790
Wait, is this a point that like my channel sucks?

1149
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:54,750
Hi, squash.

1150
02:17:55,309 --> 02:17:55,709
Oh, hi.

1151
02:17:57,239 --> 02:17:58,040
What are you playing as?

1152
02:17:58,680 --> 02:17:59,719
I'm playing as.

1153
02:17:59,719 --> 02:18:00,360
What are you playing?

1154
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,159
I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as.

1155
02:18:06,190 --> 02:18:14,959
Oh, but I like that.

1156
02:18:19,319 --> 02:18:19,639
What?

1157
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:32,889
I don't what?

1158
02:18:33,530 --> 02:18:43,690
Why do I have to delete system 32?

1159
02:18:44,329 --> 02:18:50,329
Well, that was trust no one's playlist of desserts.

1160
02:18:51,049 --> 02:18:53,180
Those are fucking great.

1161
02:18:53,180 --> 02:18:59,639
No, I know that that was a watcher watching me.

1162
02:18:59,639 --> 02:19:00,360
That was a chatter.

1163
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:03,790
But like, I'm pretending to be that channel.

1164
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:04,590
Like, why would I delete?

1165
02:19:04,590 --> 02:19:05,709
Why would I need to do that?

1166
02:19:05,709 --> 02:19:07,950
It's my motivation of being a chatter in the channel.

1167
02:19:11,549 --> 02:19:14,440
But let's go back to saying good night.

1168
02:19:15,399 --> 02:19:16,120
Trust no one.

1169
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:17,879
Again, great shit.

1170
02:19:17,879 --> 02:19:18,280
Awesome.

1171
02:19:20,030 --> 02:19:21,069
You knocked it out of the park.

1172
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:27,020
Oh, I feel like I've exhaled.

1173
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:33,399
Like 30 to 40 times tonight.

1174
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:42,000
I've done the get.

1175
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:46,479
I've been seated for so long as a 75 year old man.

1176
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:51,209
And that's the noise that you make when you get up after about an hour of sitting done.

1177
02:19:52,969 --> 02:19:56,639
Ah, that was fucking awesome.

1178
02:19:57,360 --> 02:20:02,040
But let's get back to the bits.

1179
02:20:03,979 --> 02:20:05,340
Good shit as always.

1180
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:12,620
We also had too many community subs to even count.

1181
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:14,430
Like I said earlier.

1182
02:20:15,709 --> 02:20:16,590
Thank you, everybody.

1183
02:20:17,879 --> 02:20:20,360
Marvash Magali, thanks for the 250.

1184
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:23,559
I swear, Jeremy, if there's a single Jojo dance meme in the playlist,

1185
02:20:23,559 --> 02:20:25,559
I will unsub and sue you.

1186
02:20:25,559 --> 02:20:26,760
Also, can you show Otto?

1187
02:20:27,399 --> 02:20:28,600
Otto is currently downstairs.

1188
02:20:31,709 --> 02:20:34,670
But they're I'm sorry that you have to unsubscribe.

1189
02:20:35,309 --> 02:20:36,750
I'm really sorry about that.

1190
02:20:36,750 --> 02:20:39,870
But there was at least one Jojo dance clip.

1191
02:20:47,690 --> 02:20:49,610
Thank you, peaceful Haley for the 250.

1192
02:20:50,409 --> 02:20:53,770
Hey, Jeremy, I don't really watch your streams that much anymore.

1193
02:20:53,770 --> 02:20:54,729
I'm sorry.

1194
02:20:54,729 --> 02:20:56,969
I'd like to stop in from time to time to donate.

1195
02:20:56,969 --> 02:20:59,209
And finally, I got some voice over gigs.

1196
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:03,129
It's nothing fancy just reading articles and something for e-learning.

1197
02:21:03,129 --> 02:21:05,370
But I'm so happy I finally got something.

1198
02:21:05,370 --> 02:21:07,370
And there's even more gigs to come.

1199
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:08,729
Can't wait for whatever is in store.

1200
02:21:09,610 --> 02:21:11,850
Anyways, hope you enjoy playing this baby game.

1201
02:21:11,850 --> 02:21:13,049
Mario, is it not a baby game?

1202
02:21:13,049 --> 02:21:14,010
Is it a game for adults?

1203
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:14,889
It's a game for an adult.

1204
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,159
But that's good to hear.

1205
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:18,479
Awesome.

1206
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,059
Keep chipping at it.

1207
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:25,719
Thank you so much for the 250s.

1208
02:21:25,719 --> 02:21:26,920
And I think thanks for stopping by.

1209
02:21:27,639 --> 02:21:33,500
Happy to have you whenever you end up dropping by to say hello.

1210
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:35,229
And good luck.

1211
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:37,239
Hopefully you get some more stuff going on.

1212
02:21:41,549 --> 02:21:43,870
Mr. Comcast gave $5 earlier.

1213
02:21:43,870 --> 02:21:45,629
Hey, Jeremy, John, Comcast here.

1214
02:21:46,270 --> 02:21:48,989
I've been sitting alone in my shitty ripoff version of the Batcave.

1215
02:21:48,989 --> 02:21:52,190
The calm cave, you know, because I'm rich.

1216
02:21:52,909 --> 02:21:54,670
But I've been very lonely without you.

1217
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:55,629
Going away for a week.

1218
02:21:55,629 --> 02:21:56,350
Disgraceful.

1219
02:21:56,909 --> 02:22:00,989
Anyway, I filled that time with writing short stories about you.

1220
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:03,680
I hope you enjoy.

1221
02:22:10,110 --> 02:22:11,790
This is like three pages long.

1222
02:22:12,430 --> 02:22:15,159
Yeah, I used to know German on 8-5.

1223
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:17,319
We go way back further than I can remember.

1224
02:22:17,319 --> 02:22:20,760
Back in those days, he was a somewhat normal functioning member of society.

1225
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:24,920
We'd hang around bingo halls, giving high fives to old ladies as they left.

1226
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:27,879
We'd go to see movies and eat food at places that sell food.

1227
02:22:27,879 --> 02:22:30,280
Sometimes we'd even go and eat food at the movies.

1228
02:22:30,280 --> 02:22:31,959
Life was great, tranquil, perfect.

1229
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:33,399
It didn't last.

1230
02:22:33,399 --> 02:22:34,600
Nothing good lasts forever.

1231
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:38,280
I noticed the change somewhere around 2010.

1232
02:22:39,479 --> 02:22:42,329
Instead of hanging out, he'd want to stay in.

1233
02:22:42,329 --> 02:22:43,850
We grew distant around that time.

1234
02:22:44,409 --> 02:22:47,049
If I only knew back then what I know now,

1235
02:22:47,049 --> 02:22:50,409
I'd have to try harder to get him to talk to save him.

1236
02:22:50,409 --> 02:22:51,690
But I was foolish.

1237
02:22:51,690 --> 02:22:53,770
Hanging out with Jerma became stranger.

1238
02:22:53,770 --> 02:22:55,530
It started somewhat innocent.

1239
02:22:55,530 --> 02:22:58,409
He'd go up to people, put on dumb voices, say dumb things.

1240
02:22:58,409 --> 02:23:00,409
But that was mostly the extent of it.

1241
02:23:00,409 --> 02:23:02,010
It got worse as time went on, though.

1242
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:05,850
He went from putting on voices to actually being the characters of the voices he did.

1243
02:23:07,129 --> 02:23:11,049
He'd hide in my closet, pretending to be a crazy old grandpa,

1244
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:13,610
mocking me for being bad at Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1245
02:23:15,309 --> 02:23:17,790
His words hurt, but not long after his fist did.

1246
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:36,170
Thank you for the five dollars, Mr. Comcast,

1247
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:41,129
and thanks for the story, this creative writing assignment that you've given yourself.

1248
02:23:42,010 --> 02:23:58,000
Okay, if you'd like to read more, you can read more at your own pace.

1249
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:03,129
Did I cut off my own mic?

1250
02:24:03,129 --> 02:24:04,809
No, I cut off my own throat.

1251
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:06,409
I mean, I cut off my own...

1252
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:09,049
I silenced myself.

1253
02:24:09,690 --> 02:24:17,760
I stopped talking is what I...

1254
02:24:25,049 --> 02:24:28,010
Thank you, oh my god, Teyon, for the 250.

1255
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:29,209
Great stream today, Jerma.

1256
02:24:29,209 --> 02:24:32,569
Can't wait for the 20-second Switch Block Blast stream tomorrow.

1257
02:24:35,799 --> 02:24:37,959
Fourth consecutive line, thanks for the five bucks.

1258
02:24:37,959 --> 02:24:40,520
It's okay, Jerma, you're the world record holder in our hearts.

1259
02:24:41,399 --> 02:24:42,440
Oh, hey, thank you.

1260
02:24:44,139 --> 02:24:44,620
Thank you.

1261
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:49,690
That means a lot.

1262
02:24:51,530 --> 02:24:52,649
Sirok, thanks for the 250.

1263
02:24:52,649 --> 02:24:54,170
Hey, Jerma, it's me, your agent.

1264
02:24:54,170 --> 02:24:56,889
After that embarrassing series of losses for the world record,

1265
02:24:56,889 --> 02:24:58,250
you're done as a gamer.

1266
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:00,649
But don't worry, I have another gig lined up for you.

1267
02:25:00,649 --> 02:25:03,209
They're in the Las Vegas area and they even have a website.

1268
02:25:03,209 --> 02:25:03,850
You can check it out.

1269
02:25:04,809 --> 02:25:05,850
Las Vegas...

1270
02:25:05,850 --> 02:25:07,049
I'm not even gonna read that out loud.

1271
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:10,989
But thank you for the 250.

1272
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:13,440
We appreciate it.

1273
02:25:14,909 --> 02:25:15,709
Thank you, Sirok.

1274
02:25:17,899 --> 02:25:20,780
Also, Drew Word, thanks for the three dollars and ten cents.

1275
02:25:21,739 --> 02:25:24,299
Nice driving world record in my book.

1276
02:25:28,299 --> 02:25:28,700
Thank you.

1277
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:35,850
Thank you, Drew.

1278
02:25:35,850 --> 02:25:37,370
We also had...

1279
02:25:37,370 --> 02:25:42,010
Not that long ago, we had Twitch Chat Main gave five dollars.

1280
02:25:42,809 --> 02:25:46,250
Pogchamped all over my pants.

1281
02:25:46,969 --> 02:25:51,149
You shit your pants?

1282
02:25:51,149 --> 02:25:51,790
What's that mean?

1283
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:57,799
But thank you.

1284
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:01,239
I hope he cleaned up.

1285
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:05,879
Seize of the Roman, thanks to the five dollars.

1286
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,280
Any gifters in chat?

1287
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:09,319
Any oil princes?

1288
02:26:09,319 --> 02:26:10,680
Any hedge fund managers?

1289
02:26:11,239 --> 02:26:12,360
Any tiger owners?

1290
02:26:13,159 --> 02:26:15,229
Any oil princes?

1291
02:26:15,870 --> 02:26:19,920
Oh, this is during the insane sub blast that we got.

1292
02:26:20,959 --> 02:26:21,840
Me, me, me.

1293
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:30,219
Thank you to AveryDroppedDead for the ten dollars.

1294
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:34,239
Drew, I've been watching you for years and I've finally been able to donate.

1295
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:37,520
I know it's not much, but I just want to show support to my favorite streamer.

1296
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:37,920
Thank you.

1297
02:26:38,479 --> 02:26:41,309
You got me out of a rough place a couple years ago in the laughs.

1298
02:26:41,309 --> 02:26:42,350
You gave me a priceless...

1299
02:26:43,229 --> 02:26:45,629
Thank you for being your wonderful self.

1300
02:26:46,510 --> 02:26:48,270
I love you and trans rights.

1301
02:26:49,069 --> 02:26:49,870
Transgender pride.

1302
02:26:50,430 --> 02:26:52,059
Thank you so much, Avery.

1303
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:53,659
Thank you for ten bucks.

1304
02:26:54,379 --> 02:26:59,260
And I am more than happy to be your favorite streamer.

1305
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:04,459
I...

1306
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:07,659
PeacefulHaley just came in with five community subs right now.

1307
02:27:13,549 --> 02:27:18,639
Thank you, PeacefulHaley, on top of your donation from earlier.

1308
02:27:18,639 --> 02:27:19,120
Thanks a lot.

1309
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:22,860
You're my favorite streamer.

1310
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:25,629
Thanks, guys.

1311
02:27:25,629 --> 02:27:27,870
Hey, Drew, I'm a hedge fund manager here.

1312
02:27:27,870 --> 02:27:29,950
I'd like to donate a hundred thousand dollars to you,

1313
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:32,350
but I can only do so if you give me your Twitch username and password

1314
02:27:32,350 --> 02:27:34,590
so I can deposit it in your account directly.

1315
02:27:34,590 --> 02:27:35,549
I await your response.

1316
02:27:36,750 --> 02:27:36,989
Oh.

1317
02:27:37,709 --> 02:27:38,190
Yeah, okay.

1318
02:27:39,389 --> 02:27:43,850
I mean, that makes sense because, I mean, how else would you be able to...

1319
02:27:43,850 --> 02:27:44,969
How much would you do that, right?

1320
02:27:45,850 --> 02:27:47,159
I think I get it.

1321
02:27:47,719 --> 02:27:52,430
Because that's like a large amount of money I get.

1322
02:27:52,430 --> 02:27:53,069
No, that makes sense.

1323
02:27:55,290 --> 02:27:57,930
My username is obviously German985.

1324
02:27:57,930 --> 02:27:59,290
That's my username is what it is.

1325
02:28:00,829 --> 02:28:15,000
And my password is 24.

1326
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,399
So did my stream cut out?

1327
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:18,440
I got a long password.

1328
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:19,479
It's like 600 characters.

1329
02:28:19,479 --> 02:28:19,799
I did that.

1330
02:28:19,799 --> 02:28:20,440
I think I got it all.

1331
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:23,579
What happened to the internet?

1332
02:28:24,299 --> 02:28:25,149
No, I'm here.

1333
02:28:25,870 --> 02:28:26,430
Did you get it?

1334
02:28:27,229 --> 02:28:34,719
Yeah, it's like a 600 character password.

1335
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:36,239
I'll just, I'll send it to you.

1336
02:28:39,389 --> 02:28:39,950
Thanks though.

1337
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:41,950
When should I expect the money?

1338
02:28:52,139 --> 02:28:56,059
Just German98524.

1339
02:28:56,059 --> 02:28:57,579
224.

1340
02:28:58,459 --> 02:29:00,379
German98524?

1341
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,040
I can't believe it.

1342
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:12,649
Hey, thank you too.

1343
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:15,600
Honey chain for the three bucks.

1344
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:16,719
German, you have beautiful hair.

1345
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:17,200
Thank you.

1346
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:18,399
I take very good care of it.

1347
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:25,000
I wash it and I condition it and I comb it and I brush it

1348
02:29:25,639 --> 02:29:27,239
and I eat lots of vitamin E

1349
02:29:27,239 --> 02:29:30,680
and I eat lots of high fatty omega threes

1350
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,879
to make sure it's luscious.

1351
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:33,639
I take care of it.

1352
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:35,399
I don't want to lose it.

1353
02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:44,329
But thank you for the three dollars.

1354
02:29:46,139 --> 02:29:47,500
Another hungry hedgehog.

1355
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:48,379
Thanks for the three dollars.

1356
02:29:48,379 --> 02:29:50,219
I can't stress enough how much I needed this tonight.

1357
02:29:50,219 --> 02:29:50,540
Thanks.

1358
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:55,950
I'm glad you enjoyed it because it's always a blast.

1359
02:29:55,950 --> 02:29:56,510
It's always awesome.

1360
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:59,069
I just wanted to make sure, you know, months ago

1361
02:29:59,069 --> 02:30:00,270
when I talked about doing this,

1362
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,600
I wanted to have like enough time to go by

1363
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:08,799
because this kind of shit is really overstimulating.

1364
02:30:10,569 --> 02:30:15,399
So I don't usually like to do the same thing twice.

1365
02:30:18,319 --> 02:30:20,079
And if it's something that a lot of people really want

1366
02:30:20,079 --> 02:30:21,040
and enough time goes by,

1367
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,399
then we can kind of do it again.

1368
02:30:24,920 --> 02:30:26,440
So definitely worth doing for sure.

1369
02:30:27,159 --> 02:30:29,959
Cyanide Zero coming in with 10 community subs.

1370
02:30:29,959 --> 02:30:30,760
Thank you Cyanide.

1371
02:30:31,559 --> 02:30:32,920
Lots of subs tonight.

1372
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:34,440
Wait till you see the credits roll by.

1373
02:30:38,489 --> 02:30:39,450
It's like 300.

1374
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:43,840
But thank you.

1375
02:30:45,159 --> 02:30:45,959
Really appreciate that.

1376
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:48,840
There was so...

1377
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:50,280
I think I missed community substitute

1378
02:30:50,280 --> 02:30:51,639
just because there was so many in a row.

1379
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:55,479
But whoever you are, however much you gave.

1380
02:30:57,209 --> 02:30:57,930
Thanks.

1381
02:30:57,930 --> 02:30:58,250
Really.

1382
02:31:03,469 --> 02:31:04,350
Eee half note.

1383
02:31:04,350 --> 02:31:05,469
Thanks for the five dollars.

1384
02:31:05,469 --> 02:31:05,950
Feel better.

1385
02:31:05,950 --> 02:31:06,750
Thanks for the laughs.

1386
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:08,569
Yeah, I'll be all right.

1387
02:31:08,569 --> 02:31:09,930
I just, I had a headache last night

1388
02:31:10,569 --> 02:31:11,770
and woke up with a migraine.

1389
02:31:13,979 --> 02:31:15,500
And I knew that this was going to happen tonight.

1390
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,819
So I kind of was preparing for this to be a thing.

1391
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:24,299
But for sure.

1392
02:31:24,299 --> 02:31:25,180
Yeah.

1393
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:29,370
Also, I missed from earlier.

1394
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:31,049
Never Trust a Purple gave 50 dollars.

1395
02:31:33,370 --> 02:31:34,569
Thank you for the 50 bucks.

1396
02:31:34,569 --> 02:31:36,569
There was a huge amount of big donations

1397
02:31:36,569 --> 02:31:37,930
that came in about 20 minutes ago.

1398
02:31:42,510 --> 02:31:44,190
But Never Trust a Purple gave 50 bucks.

1399
02:31:44,190 --> 02:31:45,709
Thank you so much, Purple.

1400
02:31:45,709 --> 02:31:47,389
Been here for longer than I can remember, man.

1401
02:31:47,950 --> 02:31:50,270
You've always had such a positive impact on my life

1402
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:51,549
and so many others.

1403
02:31:51,549 --> 02:31:53,309
Eight years of laughs and positivity.

1404
02:31:53,309 --> 02:31:54,270
Keep it on, keep it on.

1405
02:31:56,879 --> 02:31:57,440
I'm gonna try.

1406
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:01,209
There's lots of stuff that I still want to do

1407
02:32:01,209 --> 02:32:03,290
and I'm still trying to keep myself interested.

1408
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:07,469
So we'll see at 10 years.

1409
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:10,809
That's gonna be so weird.

1410
02:32:17,530 --> 02:32:21,840
10 straight years is coming up.

1411
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:23,760
I mean, it's gonna take like two years to do it,

1412
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:27,069
but still never thought I would be doing

1413
02:32:27,069 --> 02:32:28,030
something like this for that long.

1414
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:30,120
So thank you guys.

1415
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:30,840
Thanks for watching.

1416
02:32:31,639 --> 02:32:35,100
But thank you, Purple, for the 50 bucks.

1417
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,780
Thank you, Snooze and Cofter, for the 250.

1418
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:38,860
Wonderful second movie night.

1419
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:41,020
Love the talent and creativity this community offers.

1420
02:32:41,659 --> 02:32:43,739
Even though it's a bunch of bad jokes sometimes.

1421
02:32:44,299 --> 02:32:45,260
I always think about all the things

1422
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:46,780
I want to write in a bit message,

1423
02:32:46,780 --> 02:32:48,940
but I end up not saying or asking any of the things

1424
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:49,579
I thought about.

1425
02:32:50,219 --> 02:32:53,739
Anyway, do you plan on playing viewer levels

1426
02:32:53,739 --> 02:32:55,100
in Mario Maker?

1427
02:32:55,100 --> 02:32:55,899
Because I made some.

1428
02:32:56,540 --> 02:33:03,469
Yes, I will actually do a proper Mario Maker stream.

1429
02:33:04,569 --> 02:33:05,930
I just wanted to give some time

1430
02:33:05,930 --> 02:33:08,809
a couple hours before the movie night.

1431
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:11,870
So we will do one.

1432
02:33:12,510 --> 02:33:17,120
It'll be proper.

1433
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:19,850
Hopefully he didn't burn out

1434
02:33:19,850 --> 02:33:21,129
by playing the expert levels.

1435
02:33:21,129 --> 02:33:22,010
No, no, I was just,

1436
02:33:22,649 --> 02:33:24,170
I was just tilting myself.

1437
02:33:24,889 --> 02:33:25,850
So don't worry.

1438
02:33:26,649 --> 02:33:28,010
We will return to Mario Maker 2.

1439
02:33:29,659 --> 02:33:30,780
Let's go, actually, let's think about,

1440
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:31,739
let's think about next week here.

1441
02:33:31,739 --> 02:33:36,809
So Tuesday, I probably, you know what?

1442
02:33:36,809 --> 02:33:38,250
Tuesday is probably a good day to do it

1443
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:39,850
because Wednesday and Thursday

1444
02:33:40,489 --> 02:33:42,090
I want to do Dark Souls Randomizer.

1445
02:33:42,809 --> 02:33:44,329
At least on Wednesday.

1446
02:33:44,329 --> 02:33:46,649
So Tuesday will be Mario Maker 2.

1447
02:33:48,639 --> 02:33:51,120
Actual online levels, viewer levels.

1448
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:54,520
Wednesday will be Dark Souls Randomizer.

1449
02:33:56,090 --> 02:33:58,250
Thursday, depending on how much fun

1450
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:00,090
I'm having in either one of those things,

1451
02:34:00,809 --> 02:34:03,370
we might return to Cook, Serve, Delicious,

1452
02:34:04,010 --> 02:34:05,610
or that item shop game.

1453
02:34:06,569 --> 02:34:08,969
That's kind of the plan

1454
02:34:08,969 --> 02:34:10,409
for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

1455
02:34:11,209 --> 02:34:11,610
We'll see.

1456
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:19,200
That item shop game.

1457
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:20,799
Yeah, I don't, I can't say it.

1458
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:24,360
It's like recetteer or something.

1459
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:26,510
We'll see.

1460
02:34:30,159 --> 02:34:32,559
Thank you Cripple Crusader for the $5.

1461
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:33,520
It's been eight years.

1462
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,120
The time really flies when you're having fun.

1463
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:37,120
You've helped me in more ways than you know.

1464
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:38,399
Thanks for the years of content.

1465
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:42,250
Thanks for the five bucks.

1466
02:34:42,809 --> 02:34:44,750
That is how you say it.

1467
02:34:44,750 --> 02:34:45,870
Oh, that's good.

1468
02:34:45,870 --> 02:34:48,350
I got it right.

1469
02:34:50,510 --> 02:34:51,469
Yeah, time does fly.

1470
02:34:52,110 --> 02:34:52,989
As I get older,

1471
02:34:53,870 --> 02:34:55,870
the clock seems to be in times two speed.

1472
02:34:56,590 --> 02:35:03,500
But I'm having a great time.

1473
02:35:06,569 --> 02:35:09,209
So cherish, I cherish every moment here.

1474
02:35:11,530 --> 02:35:15,530
Great Canadian Frick Club gave $100.

1475
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:20,280
It was a ton of money dropped tonight.

1476
02:35:21,950 --> 02:35:24,430
100 bucks from Great Canadian Frick Club.

1477
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:25,870
I did a big laugh tonight.

1478
02:35:25,870 --> 02:35:26,590
Thanks, Jerma.

1479
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:37,450
Well, thank all the people that made the great videos that you watched.

1480
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:43,159
Thanks to all of you.

1481
02:35:45,549 --> 02:35:47,229
Thank you for the 100 bucks.

1482
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:51,549
DeusMorte, thanks for the $250.

1483
02:35:51,549 --> 02:35:52,750
I don't know who leaked this video,

1484
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:54,430
but I'm looking forward to the Carnival stream.

1485
02:35:54,430 --> 02:35:55,549
Who leaked this video?

1486
02:36:01,319 --> 02:36:01,799
Leaked what?

1487
02:36:09,639 --> 02:36:11,319
Well, I mean, we kind of have to watch this.

1488
02:36:44,559 --> 02:36:45,920
It's going to be fucking crazy.

1489
02:36:48,510 --> 02:36:52,430
That much I can at least promise you is it's going to be wild.

1490
02:36:52,430 --> 02:36:56,299
Prepare yourself for that stream.

1491
02:36:57,260 --> 02:37:00,360
But thank you DeusMorte for the $250.

1492
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:11,799
Chat's going to be impossible.

1493
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:13,959
No, there's a lot.

1494
02:37:14,520 --> 02:37:16,270
There's a lot of stuff we can do.

1495
02:37:23,709 --> 02:37:30,090
But thank you DeusMorte.

1496
02:37:30,090 --> 02:37:32,969
Feroidian weapon, thanks for the 10 bucks, Feroidian.

1497
02:37:33,610 --> 02:37:36,190
Can't really think of anything I haven't said already.

1498
02:37:36,909 --> 02:37:38,110
Jerma Hart, love all that you do

1499
02:37:38,110 --> 02:37:39,790
and glad you could get some laughs tonight.

1500
02:37:40,350 --> 02:37:41,389
I got a lot of them.

1501
02:37:43,959 --> 02:37:46,440
At least 10 to 20 of those videos, at least,

1502
02:37:47,079 --> 02:37:50,040
had me absolutely rolling.

1503
02:37:50,040 --> 02:37:51,500
So it was great.

1504
02:37:52,059 --> 02:37:57,530
Thank you Feroidian weapon for the 10 bucks.

1505
02:37:58,889 --> 02:38:05,819
I also want to get the subs rolling here.

1506
02:38:07,819 --> 02:38:09,899
This is going to be crazy.

1507
02:38:09,899 --> 02:38:10,700
Watch this, ready?

1508
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:13,879
Here are all the subs and resubs tonight.

1509
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:17,069
Here it goes.

1510
02:38:17,629 --> 02:38:32,190
It's going to be 200 or so people, 300.

1511
02:38:33,709 --> 02:38:36,379
Much love to y'all.

1512
02:38:36,379 --> 02:38:39,440
Try reading the names for old times sake.

1513
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:43,680
16824810765.

1514
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:44,639
Nope, not going to happen.

1515
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:53,229
What name is that?

1516
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:06,959
But thank you to Razlik Corgan for the five dollars.

1517
02:39:06,959 --> 02:39:08,159
Thank you for the amazing eight years

1518
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:09,360
of wonderful videos and stream.

1519
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,479
Hope for many more to come.

1520
02:39:12,479 --> 02:39:12,959
Much love.

1521
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,680
Thank you Razlik for your five dollars.

1522
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,770
And the really nice, nice words.

1523
02:39:20,329 --> 02:39:22,750
Look at that image, what image.

1524
02:39:23,389 --> 02:39:29,180
That's scary.

1525
02:39:32,219 --> 02:39:33,500
That is a creepy face.

1526
02:39:43,610 --> 02:39:44,569
Jerma Grin.

1527
02:39:46,799 --> 02:39:48,079
That is a shit-eating grin.

1528
02:39:59,069 --> 02:40:00,190
Maybe we'll add it to the list.

1529
02:40:04,219 --> 02:40:05,739
Hey Tingy, thanks for the 250.

1530
02:40:06,379 --> 02:40:07,659
Streams like these are so much fun.

1531
02:40:07,659 --> 02:40:09,020
There are so many talented people in chat.

1532
02:40:09,020 --> 02:40:09,899
It's incredible.

1533
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:10,860
Cheers to you, chat.

1534
02:40:12,090 --> 02:40:12,969
Cheers to chat.

1535
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:15,819
Cheers to chat.

1536
02:40:15,819 --> 02:40:16,540
Cheers to everybody.

1537
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:17,340
Cheers to the viewers.

1538
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:18,459
Cheers to you.

1539
02:40:19,899 --> 02:40:24,860
That's right, you, for making this possible.

1540
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:25,979
Never Trust a Purple.

1541
02:40:25,979 --> 02:40:27,340
15 more dollars.

1542
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:28,059
Thank you, Purple.

1543
02:40:29,979 --> 02:40:31,420
Three years here with you, man.

1544
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:32,219
Three years.

1545
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:34,860
You've changed my life more than I could ever describe.

1546
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:35,659
Three years.

1547
02:40:35,659 --> 02:40:36,620
I'll be here for 30.

1548
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:38,559
Never stop.

1549
02:40:38,559 --> 02:40:41,760
Best content creator on the internet in modern history.

1550
02:40:42,639 --> 02:40:46,639
That's incredibly flattering that you think that

1551
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:51,360
you've been around for a long time, Purple.

1552
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,520
So thank you.

1553
02:40:56,879 --> 02:40:58,000
Let's keep going, right?

1554
02:40:58,559 --> 02:40:59,760
Let's keep trying new things.

1555
02:41:00,399 --> 02:41:03,440
A couple more.

1556
02:41:03,440 --> 02:41:05,760
Here we have Nickname Jack for the 250.

1557
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:06,639
Amazing encore.

1558
02:41:06,639 --> 02:41:07,600
Thanks for the laughs tonight.

1559
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:10,159
So many talents in chat.

1560
02:41:10,159 --> 02:41:10,639
Love you all.

1561
02:41:17,239 --> 02:41:18,760
Thank you, Nickname Jack.

1562
02:41:21,879 --> 02:41:22,680
Really appreciate it.

1563
02:41:23,239 --> 02:41:26,190
Thank you Sir Black Mage for the 250.

1564
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:28,190
Jermbo, EU pleb here.

1565
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:31,790
It's 4 a.m. in Austria and I'm falling asleep at my desk.

1566
02:41:32,350 --> 02:41:34,829
But it was worth staying up for this hysterical stream.

1567
02:41:34,829 --> 02:41:38,190
Also been watching you since 2004 or something.

1568
02:41:40,989 --> 02:41:43,819
That's a long fucking time.

1569
02:41:47,020 --> 02:41:48,860
Back in 20... 2004.

1570
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:53,469
I don't think you noticed.

1571
02:41:53,469 --> 02:41:56,620
Well, however long...

1572
02:41:56,620 --> 02:41:57,500
That's a long time.

1573
02:42:00,719 --> 02:42:02,000
Back in 1985.

1574
02:42:04,639 --> 02:42:07,440
But hopefully you didn't have to stay up too late for this.

1575
02:42:08,239 --> 02:42:09,840
Sir Black Mage, thanks for the 250.

1576
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:11,600
Glad you enjoyed it.

1577
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:13,760
And thanks for watching for so damn long.

1578
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:14,639
That's a long time.

1579
02:42:17,469 --> 02:42:17,870
Thank you.

1580
02:42:18,430 --> 02:42:24,920
And then at the very end here, Nico Cat gave 10 bucks right at the very end.

1581
02:42:25,639 --> 02:42:27,629
Hey Jerma, always enjoyed your stream.

1582
02:42:27,629 --> 02:42:30,030
You're one of the best most genuine streamers on the site.

1583
02:42:30,030 --> 02:42:31,309
Gotta ask though.

1584
02:42:31,309 --> 02:42:33,870
Did you ever think you'd play Cave Story on stream?

1585
02:42:34,909 --> 02:42:35,870
Interestingly enough.

1586
02:42:35,870 --> 02:42:36,670
First of all, thank you.

1587
02:42:37,629 --> 02:42:41,450
And secondly, I did.

1588
02:42:42,729 --> 02:42:48,010
Anyone remember the old YouTube streams from 2012?

1589
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:48,809
2013?

1590
02:42:49,690 --> 02:42:53,069
I streamed Cave Story a few times.

1591
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:00,600
Those old YouTube streams from 2004.

1592
02:43:01,239 --> 02:43:05,209
You did YouTube streams?

1593
02:43:05,209 --> 02:43:06,569
Yeah, I did YouTube streams.

1594
02:43:07,899 --> 02:43:09,899
But this is before YouTube gaming.

1595
02:43:09,899 --> 02:43:11,420
This is years before that.

1596
02:43:13,530 --> 02:43:13,930
YouTube...

1597
02:43:13,930 --> 02:43:18,649
Yeah, I streamed like Diablo 3 and a few other things.

1598
02:43:18,649 --> 02:43:19,370
10 million.

1599
02:43:19,370 --> 02:43:20,170
I remember those streams.

1600
02:43:20,170 --> 02:43:21,370
I remember my power going up.

1601
02:43:22,090 --> 02:43:26,250
I remember the lightning struck a mile away from my house and turned off like my entire

1602
02:43:26,250 --> 02:43:26,969
street's power.

1603
02:43:27,850 --> 02:43:35,799
I remember I didn't watch the TF2 streams because I was like gross live.

1604
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:39,340
Well, streaming wasn't really that popular back then either.

1605
02:43:40,219 --> 02:43:46,159
Didn't really catch on until somewhere in 2013?

1606
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:46,959
2012?

1607
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:52,399
But that's my time.

1608
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:53,520
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

1609
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:56,350
We will do some fun stuff.

1610
02:43:57,709 --> 02:43:59,469
Have a wonderful rest of your weekend.

1611
02:43:59,469 --> 02:44:01,069
Hope you enjoyed the encore.

1612
02:44:01,069 --> 02:44:04,510
Thank you again to all the incredibly talented fucking people that made great shit.

1613
02:44:05,229 --> 02:44:06,829
And thanks for sticking around and watching it.

1614
02:44:07,549 --> 02:44:11,930
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

1615
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:19,290
Good evening.

1616
02:44:19,290 --> 02:44:20,010
Good evening.

1617
02:44:20,649 --> 02:44:34,090
Why is my stuff broken?

1618
02:44:36,219 --> 02:44:43,309
Nova, we got talent.

1619
02:44:43,309 --> 02:44:44,030
What's Nova doing?

1620
02:44:45,899 --> 02:44:47,659
All right, Nova's playing Mario Maker 2.

1621
02:44:49,959 --> 02:44:50,520
Go see.

1622
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:56,840
I want you guys to prepare for my stream for Mario Maker 2.

1623
02:44:57,479 --> 02:45:05,950
It's been a long time since we've said hello to James.

1624
02:45:08,909 --> 02:45:10,350
Like more than a few months.

1625
02:45:11,069 --> 02:45:16,159
And he's playing Mario Maker 2 so it's pretty relevant right now.

1626
02:45:16,159 --> 02:45:25,979
Go say hello.

1627
02:45:38,059 --> 02:45:39,180
What's our battle cry?

1628
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:43,260
Um sup.

1629
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:46,879
Say sup.

1630
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:51,360
And I want you to pay attention to how good Nova is at this game

1631
02:45:51,360 --> 02:45:52,639
because you need to be ready to watch me.

1632
02:45:54,920 --> 02:45:56,680
He ain't going to get a world record on a speedrun.

1633
02:45:57,319 --> 02:46:00,120
Here we go.

1634
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:13,120
Are we ready?

1635
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:16,440
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

1636
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:16,840
Take care.

1637
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:41,979
Much love to you.
