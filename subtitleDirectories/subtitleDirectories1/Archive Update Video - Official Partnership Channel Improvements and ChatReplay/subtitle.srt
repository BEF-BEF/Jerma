00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,509
Hello everyone, my name is Bacon and welcome to the German Stream Archive.

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,070
Today I have a long overdue update video for you all where we'll be talking about some important

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,980
things. It's been a long time since the last update video and because of that there's a lot

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,320
that needs to be talked about. There are timestamps in the description and the comments for each

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,570
section you might find important. You can also make use of the YouTube chapter feature to skip

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,530
around to find the info you're looking for. There's this section which is the introduction.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,530
Here we'll be talking a little bit about who we are, what we do in the channel, and where we came

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,520
from. After that we need to talk about the channel being officially partnered with Germa

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,060
and monetization. Next we'll be talking about changes and improvements to how we archive

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:50,039
streams. After that we'll be talking about chat replay which is a new way to watch back chat on

11
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,009
our uploads. If that interests you then you don't want to miss that section. Finally I'll be ending

12
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:01,500
with a Q&A answering some questions that we keep getting asked. As I mentioned before it's been a

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,189
long time since the last update video. Between the last update video and now both Germa and this

14
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:13,579
channel have grown tenfold so I felt it's worth reintroducing Starkiller and I. My name is Bacon.

15
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:19,180
I own and run this channel alongside Starkiller. I started the Sturr Stream Archive more than five

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,939
years ago around late 2016 and added Germa to the archive shortly after to make it the Sturr

17
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:31,640
slash Germa Stream Archive. In late 2018 we split the channel into two, the Sturr Stream Archive

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,170
and the Germa Stream Archive. Since then Germa has only grown exponentially in popularity until

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,379
we get where we are today. My role in this channel is to download the video from Twitch

20
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,260
and re-upload them to YouTube. I also handle most of the business management and community

21
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,140
affairs of this channel like this update video. Starkiller is my friend who's been helping me

22
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,480
run this channel since near the start. Starkiller has his own channel where he used to archive

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,439
Germa streams until he noticed my channel getting more views and having the official name

24
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,039
Sturr slash Germa Stream Archive so he messaged me one day asking if he should stop uploading on

25
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,280
his channel. Instead of telling him to stop I actually decided to invite him to work on

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,460
the archive channel with me and he's been helping me since. His role in the channel is making the

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,419
thumbnail, putting the title, the description, end cards, and the rest of what makes a video a video.

28
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:29,000
He used to handle the downloading and uploading of VODs as well before I got my fiber internet.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,879
If for some reason I can't download a VOD he's usually my backup and he comes in the clutch

30
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,860
because of that. Now that you know this a little bit better let's talk more about the partnership

31
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,379
and monetization I mentioned before. You guys heard me right, partnership. I've been talking

32
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,460
to Community Jake and Germa and they've asked us to come work for them officially and make the

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,020
channel an official archive channel as well as be a part of Germa's umbrella of channels.

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,259
For the most part things will be run the same except for a few changes we'll talk about later

35
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:02,539
in this video. It's just that now we're official and we'll be getting paid for it. After the last

36
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:07,659
time I mentioned monetization or donations I've decided to be careful about money on this channel.

37
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,500
The last time still giving me nightmares for even daring to mention monetization.

38
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,849
Before I felt it wasn't fair to enable ads without Germa's permission or without working

39
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,680
something out with him first. Now since we're officially working for Germa we'll be enabling

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,650
monetization on streams. I know people don't like ads so Community Jake and I decided on a decent

41
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,330
spacing of ads that won't be too intrusive for you guys. I really hope you guys don't get too

42
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,610
angry at us this time because honestly this opportunity Community Jake and Germa have given

43
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,419
us is like a ray of light in the dark for us here at the archive. If you feel this monetization is

44
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,909
unfair towards Germa then don't worry. Part of this ad revenue will go straight back to Germa

45
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,219
and funding his big shows. As for the money that is coming to us at the archive we will do our

46
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:00,840
best to earn our keep which leads us to the next section I want to talk about upcoming changes

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,250
and improvements we plan on making to the channel. A while back I made a survey about the volume of

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,159
Germa streams. In that survey I asked if there were any changes that you wanted to see made to

49
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,550
the channel. I wanted to thank everyone who left a suggestion even if you made a suggestion for a

50
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,149
change that was denied. I really appreciate all the comments. The suggestions have been read

51
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:28,139
through and considered. Changes that are rejected will be explained as to why afterwards.

52
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,779
It's important to understand that we're trying to balance the channel being an archive and the

53
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,279
channel being viewer friendly. For example splitting the streams up by game versus not

54
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,720
splitting up the streams up at all versus splitting an eight hour stream into shorter sections of four

55
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,120
hours each. Inevitably I can't make everyone happy but I can do my best by making a few improvements.

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,500
With that being said let's first start with changes not to be made. Many of these stem from

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,180
not having enough time or just not being very feasible. The first thing is having playlists for

58
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,740
many different types of streams or even just a playlist for different periods and arcs of

59
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,420
Germa's life and the reason I don't want to do this is because having too many playlists makes

60
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,120
it hard to sort through and also it's just too many playlists to kind of sort things into so

61
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,100
that'll be a little bit too much. The next one is more detailed timestamps and chapters.

62
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,699
For example timestamping highlights or skipping to a specific point in the VOD or timestamping

63
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,980
the beginning of him playing. For this one I'd say just have a little bit more patience. It takes

64
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,860
too much time to timestamp everything. We do like however seeing some people timestamp different

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,339
bits in the video and we may occasionally heart some of those comments if you timestamp the video

66
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,629
so thank you if you do that. The next one is kind of similar in that it's editing out BRB sections

67
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,800
and trimming streams down. This one takes a little bit too much work for not much return.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,199
If you don't like the BRB sections try watching some long edits of the streams like Skye's

69
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:03,220
long edits or Chelsea's stream recaps or if those are too long watch the second Germa videos which

70
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,339
are also very very good with some talented editors. On top of all that we're a stream

71
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,699
archive so it doesn't make much sense to edit the streams down. The next one on the list is

72
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:18,709
having the date in the title. Now this one kind of clutches the title too much. In the past we

73
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:24,790
used to put the title in the the date in the title but we decided to take it off. It's nicer and

74
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,939
cleaner not having the date and the date is already in the description. This next one is speeding up

75
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:35,399
VOD uploads. This one I kind of don't really understand because usually I like to have the

76
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:41,480
videos uploaded the night of the stream and have it go up the next morning. It takes a little bit

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,079
of extra time to get all the bits ready especially if it's closer to midnight when he ends the stream

78
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,680
or if it's a bigger stream like the latest Elden Ring streams. So if it takes any longer it's

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,079
usually due to copyright or having to edit the video for some other reason or it's a big stream

80
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:03,220
that I'm waiting for Community Jake to send a copy of the studio recording. If for some reason

81
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,699
it takes a little longer than I expect I usually try to announce it in the archive discord so if

82
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,699
you want some more news about when a video is going to come out late go ahead and join the

83
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:19,180
archive discord. This next one is kind of similar to what we talked about before splitting the videos

84
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,860
up into parts for example splitting Elden Ring part one into two four-hour videos. This one's not

85
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,579
really feasible for the same reason as not trimming it down. It takes more time to do for not much

86
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,540
return more time to upload and it wouldn't be a very good viewing experience for the majority of

87
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,629
people. YouTube does a really good job of saving your place or you can just leave a comment with

88
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:46,920
the timestamp that you left off. I prefer to have one eight-hour video than two four-hour videos

89
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,399
and this also means less ads in general. This next one is on the other spectrum of splitting

90
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:57,079
streams and that is not splitting streams that have two games in it. This one we like to do at

91
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:02,500
the archive because it makes it easier for a couple reasons. One if a stream gets blocked or a game

92
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,779
gets blocked for whatever reason the audio the music in the game it makes it easier to split the

93
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,860
game up so that the other game that he streams doesn't get blocked. Another reason we like doing

94
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,100
this is because it helps people find the game they want to see Jerma playing without having

95
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,730
them skim through a bunch of different streams to try to find it. It also makes things easier to

96
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,290
place them in the playlist for organization's sake and also for people wanting to binge watch

97
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,000
a specific game. This next one relates to what we talked about earlier with monetization and that

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,629
is to reduce the amount of ads in videos. Now I want to make clear that if any video gets any

99
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:42,549
amount of copyright claims more times than not there tends to be an insane amount of ads and we

100
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:47,769
can't do anything about it to reduce the amount of ads. For example the Laugh You Lose video got

101
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:53,850
claimed and has so many ads in such a short amount of time. I've heard reports of about one every 10

102
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,590
seconds. For the videos that we can control ads on I do my best to make sure to minimize ads while

103
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,820
still keeping him there. When I talked to community Jake about it I told him that I like to keep ads

104
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:11,179
to a relative minimum and he agreed so we agreed on a good ad spacing for us both. This next one

105
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:16,059
asks us to put the hour a stream starts into the description. Now for this one I kind of want to

106
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:22,059
ask why. Also I don't really know how to find that without keeping track of the time he starts

107
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:28,299
because oftentimes he starts at different times and he's just late. This one asks us to announce

108
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:33,750
when VODs will come out. Now for this one as I mentioned before VODs usually come out within

109
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:39,029
the next day or two of the original stream. If it takes any longer I'll announce it in the community

110
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,220
tab or I'll announce it in our discord. A few of you have asked us to place VODs into a non-youtube

111
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:52,039
place for example mega, dropbox, google drive, etc. This is something that I've actually kind of

112
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,600
wanted to do but I'm not even sure how to do it without an insane additional cost for the amount

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,960
of streams and data that are going to be archived the extra time it'll take to upload them. It's

114
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,779
something I'm interested in but it's just not very feasible at the moment. This next one is one that

115
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,019
gets requested fairly often and that is to put the twitch VOD link in the description. After a couple

116
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,059
months the original VOD gets deleted meaning the link is only valid for those 60 days that the VOD

117
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:22,419
is available. While I could delete the link after 60 days I'm not really looking to track every VOD

118
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,620
for 60 days for the rest of the time German streams so yeah sorry about that. After around

119
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,659
germans resident evil village streams this is one that gets requested fairly often and that is to

120
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:39,860
upscale the videos into 1080p uploads instead of letting youtube downscale to 720p. Now there's

121
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,620
a little bit of technicality stuff going on here but to kind of put it simply it's a little bit

122
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,259
more work to put into 1080p. This is something that I actually kind of want to see and look into

123
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,220
and experiment but if it ends up being too hard to do too much overhead we might not end up doing

124
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,259
it so there's a chance that we'll do this but don't really count on it too much at the moment.

125
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,370
This next one is one that gets requested very often and that is to put chat on screen. The

126
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,289
reason I don't want to do this is because I don't want chat to become mandatory for people who

127
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:14,730
dislike chat. I know a good portion actually a majority of people don't like having chat on

128
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,649
screen. In the past I did a poll and a majority of the people said that they didn't like chat and

129
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,970
didn't want chat on screen so because of this I don't want to make it mandatory for people who

130
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:31,879
don't want it. Now I understand that having chat is what makes a stream well a stream but I can't

131
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:35,960
admit that chat can be distracting at times and sometimes you just want to see a full screen of

132
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,200
germa focus on germa. Now this last denied change I want to talk about is anything that relates to

133
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:49,080
changes on germa's side for example putting chat on stream or having more facecam time or doing

134
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:55,399
specific kind of stream because for the simple fact that I am not germa. Well that was a little

135
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,200
bit long and I hope you guys weren't getting too bored but now it's time for the exciting part

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,490
which is talking about the upcoming changes and improvements that I want to implement.

137
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,289
Starting off we'll be talking about one change that's on germa's side. The main purpose of the

138
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:14,889
VOD volume survey was to determine if it was a minority a majority of people who were experiencing

139
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:20,009
audio issues with germa streams. I showed the results of the VOD volume survey to Community

140
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:24,730
Jake and both Germa and Community Jake agreed that something needs to be changed so they'll be

141
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,690
looking into making some changes soon. Frankly I'm actually really happy that I was able to do

142
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,610
something that helps improve the stream for everyone else. Now for the first change that

143
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,649
we'll be making on the channel is we'll be starting to mark the start and end of the BRB

144
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:44,090
segments to make it its own BRB segment in the chapters. Additionally we'll also be time stamping

145
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,870
where we pull the thumbnail from. Big streams are important for Germa right now so I want to make

146
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,309
sure that his archive of that stream is as good a quality as we can get it. So because of that

147
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,490
Community Jake will be sending us recordings of those big production streams to upload.

148
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,610
If for whatever reason he can't send it then we'll be uploading the twitch version instead.

149
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,279
This next one is something that's been requested fairly often and that is having community made

150
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,600
subtitles. We'll be looking a little bit into having these community made subtitles. Now

151
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,720
obviously this change relies more on the community so it's not for sure if this change will be made

152
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
for certain but if anybody's interested in helping write eight hour long subtitles for

153
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,600
fans of hard hearing please let me know message me on discord my discord will be in the description.

154
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,840
At the very least if anybody's interested in helping subtitle some of Germa's bigger streams

155
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,000
I'd be very grateful for that. This next change and the change after that are some changes that

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,559
we've already made to the archive channel. The first change slash improvement being uploading

157
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:45,080
and recovering older lost vods or blocked streams that have been blocked worldwide or for

158
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,879
certain people. As some of you keen-eyed viewers may have seen we've already re-uploaded Germa's

159
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:56,460
Jump King part 2 stream which is uploaded with some parts muted while keeping Germa's voice intact.

160
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,019
Big thanks to Sky for helping out with the audio for that stream. If you guys haven't already please

161
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,879
go to his channel and give him some love. He's been very kind and helpful to me. I wanted to

162
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:09,960
start bringing back more of those long lost blocked streams or even some of the very old

163
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,539
streams that were thought to be lost to time if possible. I'll be making a community post in the

164
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:19,980
near future asking for suggestions on what videos you want to see returned next for the next change

165
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,460
we've already made. For streams that we have separated by game like a recent stream where he

166
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,740
streamed Mario Golf, Picross, Big Brand Academy, and Elden Ring we'll be linking the other games

167
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,620
within that same stream but you'll be able to click the link to it in the comments of the video

168
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,820
to other parts within that same stream. Getting down to the last couple changes the next one is

169
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,470
having detailed thumbnails for example part numbers within the thumbnail. We're going to

170
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,370
start trying to put a little bit more detail into the thumbnails mostly just putting part

171
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,110
numbers on the thumbnail if applicable but we'll see what else we can do. Finally the last thing

172
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,179
I want to talk about is something that has been requested over and over again. In the past I've

173
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:04,659
said I wanted a way to add chat to these VODs while at the same time making them optional for

174
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:10,309
people that don't want them or don't like having the chat alongside the video. I'm pleased to

175
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,429
announce that I finally have a solution that's available for you guys. What I have for you guys

176
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:22,019
is a website called Chat Replay. Well what is it you may be asking? This website will allow you to

177
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,320
watch archived drama streams with a replay of twitch chat alongside the video. This means you

178
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,919
get to see your favorite one guy moments live in chat or see twitch chat say hi to the VOD watchers.

179
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:38,759
That's you guys. Chat Replay will not only let you watch archived drama streams with chat but also

180
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,389
many other participating channels. That's not all though. If you prefer to stay on YouTube to watch

181
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:49,750
streams then you can take advantage of the Chat Replay extension to have chat embedded right on

182
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,990
the YouTube page right next to the video. The extension will add a button below the YouTube

183
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,690
player that will allow you to embed chat into the YouTube page, pop chat out to put wherever you

184
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:06,440
please, or open a twitch-like theater mode for you to view just like you're on Twitch.

185
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,909
The extension is available now on Chrome and Firefox. If you're on a browser that doesn't

186
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:17,620
support the extension or you're on mobile, you can still make use of the Chat Replay website.

187
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,100
If you guys know a YouTube channel that uploads a copy of Twitch streams to YouTube

188
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,019
and you want to see Chat Replay on that channel, ask them to message me or Restorn on Discord.

189
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,179
My Discord will be in the description and Restorn's Discord can be found on the top

190
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:38,279
of the Chat Replay website if you click the Join button. I just want to remind you guys that when

191
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,519
you're asking your favorite channels to implement Chat Replay, please do so politely. Don't spam them

192
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,259
asking them to join your Chat Replay and keep it civilized, please. You can link them to this video

193
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,659
with a timestamp to the start of this section or just link them to the Chat Replay website.

194
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:59,980
The link to the website and the download pages for the extension will be in the description.

195
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,779
Bringing you guys Chat wouldn't be possible without the help of community member Restorn.

196
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,779
He's the one who created and maintains Chat Replay in the background, so please give him

197
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:13,740
some of your guys' thanks. In addition, if you guys run into any problems, please let him know

198
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,029
directly. Please don't leave any comments somewhere else and expect a problem to be fixed.

199
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:23,910
If you guys like Chat Replay, please feel free to toss Restorn a couple dollars using the Donate

200
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,069
button on the top right of the website. You guys have been asking for Chat for a long time. It's

201
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:35,849
a question that has been asked for years. Can you please add Chat to the videos? So I'm glad to have

202
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,650
finally gotten a good solution to that question. There are more things you guys have been asking,

203
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,390
so I feel like it's time to move into the Q&A section of this video. These questions are picked

204
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,319
out from the Bod Volume Survey, as well as a couple from the community post I made recently.

205
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,200
Again, big thank you for your questions, even if I didn't pick yours to be answered. If you have a

206
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,960
question that you'd like to have answered but isn't in this section of the video, you can go

207
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,680
ahead and ask in the comments and I'll do my best to answer as many as I can. The questions can be

208
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,519
about anything like Chat Replay, the partner slash monetization, the channel, or anything else.

209
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,740
Just please try to keep the questions somewhat related to Germa or this channel. This section

210
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,730
might be fairly long, so I'll try to get through it as quick as possible. But if you're not interested

211
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:26,359
in listening to me answer some questions, feel free to skip to the timestamp on screen. Or you

212
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,019
can exit the video now because this is the last section of the update video. If you decide to

213
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,980
leave, thanks for stopping by and listening. I hope you had a great day. For those of you still

214
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,900
here, let's get into those questions. Question one asks us how much work goes into uploading

215
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,299
a video from Twitch to YouTube. Generally, the stream takes about two hours for me to download

216
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,819
the VOD, make sure it's ready for upload, and upload it. I'm able to upload it quickly with

217
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,339
gigabit fiber internet. While it uploads, I link chat using Chat Replay so it'll be available as

218
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:02,819
soon as it's live. Once it's uploaded and processed, it's in Starkiller's hands where

219
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:07,539
he skims through the video to find a suitable thumbnail, writes the title, description, puts

220
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:13,779
playlists, end cards, and finally sets up the video to go up at 7am PST. On to question two,

221
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:18,819
what's our relationship to Germa and did we have to get special permission to upload VODs?

222
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:23,720
Up until about the time Germa moved to Vegas, we didn't have direct contact with him. I think he

223
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,440
was a little cautious of us up until then, but since then he's been talking to us more,

224
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,000
and I even got a chance to show him the sunflowers that I was growing while not knowing at all that

225
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,279
he was also growing some too. While we didn't have to get special permission, I made sure early on

226
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,680
in the channel's life to get explicit permission from both Stirr and Germa before I continued

227
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,119
archiving for the public. I still uploaded streams for my personal use though. Question three,

228
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,500
how long do you plan on doing this channel? Currently, the plan is to upload as long as

229
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,180
Germa is streaming. If for some reason we have to stop uploading, I'll do my absolute best

230
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,200
to find a replacement so that the archive stays updated. Question four asks, do we edit any VODs

231
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,910
or they re-upload from Twitch? We tend to try to keep the VODs as close to a source as possible.

232
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,390
The only edits we do are cutting the empty spaces of not talking at the beginning of the streams,

233
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,230
or when we split up the streams by games he plays, or in the rare instances of copyright blocking a

234
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,829
stream, we try to edit out any of the copyrighted content. On the topic of copyright content,

235
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:31,109
question five asks, how do you deal with copyright claims that block streams? If he's playing a

236
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:37,029
random, somewhat unimportant game like House Flipper or Fart Simulator 2023, then it's easier to just

237
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,490
mute the section that gets claimed. But for big streams like Dollhouse, Game Awards, or other

238
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,049
streams where sound is important, we determine if we have a case to file a dispute against that

239
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:51,450
It has to be almost clear that we'll win the dispute, because with too many strikes,

240
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:57,049
the channel will get deleted and that's no good. Question six asks, what would you do if a seagull

241
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:04,069
crashed into your room? Question seven asks, what are your favorite content creators aside from

242
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:09,940
Jerma? At the cost of my pride, I'll reveal some of the people I've been watching lately. I have

243
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,500
been watching a lot of VTubers lately, but more specifically, I've been watching some Nijisanji

244
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:20,920
members like Salen, Pomu, or Finana. It's only a few streams here and there from a few members

245
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,960
of Nijien, depending on if they play a game I want to watch. Aside from that, I've been

246
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,039
enjoying many of True Nerd's Fallout YOLO runs, Ray Navey's Jr. streams, and very occasionally

247
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,759
Soviet Womble and Russian Badger whenever they upload. Starkiller, on the other hand, enjoys

248
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:44,519
watching Vinny Vinesauce, Kitboga, SimpleFlips, Many True Nerd as well, Windigoon, and JimmyIsHere.

249
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,869
There's a few more that he likes to watch, but those are the ones he's been watching lately.

250
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:53,589
Since I had out myself watching VTubers, I'll hint at Starkiller's favorite VTuber.

251
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,259
You'll see it on screen now. Now that I look at it, most of the questions that are left are about us,

252
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,660
so if you guys aren't interested in that, then also you can skip to the timestamp. Question eight

253
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,799
asks, what is our favorite Jerma stream? Mine is Chibi-Robo because it was my favorite GameCube game,

254
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,880
but no one else seems to like it for some reason. Either that or Rhythm Heaven Fever.

255
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,650
Starkiller's favorite Jerma stream is either the Long Drive or Talk to Transformers since

256
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:24,599
he's seen the highlights for many times. That or the Sorcery streams. Question nine asks,

257
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,119
pineapple on pizza or no? If I have a choice, no, but I'll eat it if that's what gets ordered

258
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:36,230
because I prefer not starving. Still on the topic of foods, what is our favorite food?

259
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:42,230
Quesadillas. I love Quesadillas so much, but mostly only the ones that I make myself. That's mostly

260
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,210
because the ones from the fast food chains taste like fake cheese. Starkiller, on the other hand,

261
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,140
had a hard time deciding, but settled on pizza and Chinese food. Question 11 asks, how many

262
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:59,779
Burger King burgers have you eaten? Wouldn't you like to know McDonald's spy? Now on to the last

263
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:05,539
question, question 12. Is this channel a labor of love? A lot of time and effort goes into this

264
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,680
channel that there's worried of us getting burned out. Years ago when I first started this channel,

265
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,160
it started off as a personal storage of VODs that I wanted to watch later that I didn't want to

266
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,359
save before Twitch deleted them. As I started to see more people make use of the Archive channel

267
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,359
and as I got better internet and storage space, the channel started becoming a better way to

268
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,319
serve the community and for me to personally give back to Jerma since at the time I didn't have

269
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:34,779
money to sub or give bits. Nowadays, as Starkiller and I become busy in our personal lives,

270
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:39,819
update the channel each Jerma stream is something we have less time for, but seeing how many people

271
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:45,660
we help just by uploading this funny man makes it all worth it for us. So with that last question,

272
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,269
that brings this video to a close. There was a lot that was talked about here with the partnership,

273
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:56,099
upcoming changes, and chat replay, so I hope it wasn't too boring to watch.

274
00:23:56,099 --> 00:24:00,019
Like I mentioned at the beginning of the Q&A section, if you have a question about anything

275
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:03,940
I talked about here today, please feel free to leave it at the comment section below and I'll

276
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,660
try to answer as many as I can. In addition to that, if you want more news about the Archive,

277
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,779
want to stay updated with why Abad might be out later than usual, or just want a place to hang out,

278
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:18,920
come join our Discord. In there, it's always time for some juicy franks.

279
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,829
One final thing before I end the video, I wanted to thank you all for your support from the bottom

280
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:28,619
of my heart. If you excuse a quick tangent for me to share a little more about myself,

281
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:33,670
I had always dreamed to be a YouTube star as many kids do. Growing older, I realized I don't exactly

282
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,710
have the personality or the voice to make good content. Even while doing this line, I had to

283
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,670
retake it several times. However, this channel has allowed me to live vicariously, feeling the

284
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:48,710
support of the community. I know most of you guys' support goes to Jerma, but I read every comment

285
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,029
that you guys leave thanking us for the Archive, and it always makes me glad that I get to be a

286
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:58,650
part of something so cool and useful to so many people, including Jerma himself. We here at the

287
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,130
Archive want to thank you once again for your support, and we will do our best to keep providing

288
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,670
the Jerma content you know and love. Thank you all, and see you next time.
