Gemma985 is filmed in front of a live studio audience.

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:26,179
Okay, let me get things all settled here. Got my microphone, I got everything set, got the gameplay, ready to record.

3
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,679
Alright, let's do it.

4
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,679
Ahem, ahem.

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,739
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermi-

6
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,240
Oh, making a commentary?

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:42,820
Well, I was trying to until I was rudely interrupted.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,670
No, but seriously, man, you look stressed. What's, uh, what's wrong?

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:55,670
Ah, yeah, just got back from the grocery store. The lines were really long, but I managed to pick up some fruits and vegetables on the way home.

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,670
Oh, I'm gonna be making some of my famous chicken pot pie.

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,310
Oh boy, looks like we're doing takeout again tonight.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,150
Why wasn't I invited in the shindig?

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,439
Boon, I didn't know you were coming over. God, I had so many interruptions. I'm never gonna get this commentary.

14
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,439
Um, guys, this isn't part of the video right now. I just got a phone call.

15
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:29,379
Um, everybody I've ever met in my life is in the hospital right now. I have to go.

16
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:35,640
Pizza? I didn't think we were gonna get pizza. Hang on, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get my wallet.

17
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:47,269
Let's, uh, let's do this commentary now. I can sit down, I can actually do this freaking thing. I don't have to keep getting interrupted by people, so-

18
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,269
Hey, motherfucker! It's me, Grandpa!

19
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:55,370
What are you doing?

20
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,609
Um, working on a commentary, actually.

21
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,109
Oh yeah, working on a commentary. Look at me! My name is Gerber! Working on a commentary! Look at how smart I am!

22
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:11,819
Yeah, that's- I'm trying to get it done, so I would appreciate it if you just took off for a little while, Grandpa.

23
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,819
That's okay, I'll leave you to your work.

24
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,340
Cause I- I'll just leave you to your work. I'm gonna make sure-

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,800
Don't- I- Tonight can you hear me talk? I didn't even say anything funny! Shut the fuck up!

26
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,610
I forgot my line. They really just screwed me over right there.

27
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,110
You know what I'm saying? Thank you! Thank you, studio audience! You really fucked it all up for me!

28
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:44,539
Yeah, you know what that is? That's the double middle finger. You can laugh all you want, I don't give a shit. I'm outta here.

29
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,539
Alright, well, see you later.

30
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,539
Can I finally get this thing done? For Pete's sake, here we go.

31
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:57,169
Hey, what is going on everybody? Gerber here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

32
00:02:57,169 --> 00:03:01,169
And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with me, and that's it!
