1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:09,529
Look who's back. Back again. Jerma's back. Tell all your friends and tell them to subscribe to me too.

2
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:33,079
Hey guys. Dad is home. It's been a while. This coffee is old. That's what you get. I'm gonna make

3
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:59,350
a tweet. I'll be right back. See ya. Somebody just said you can go offline at any time.

4
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:12,359
It's true. I don't think I would hold an audience for very long if I just turned my stream off

5
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:20,230
in 20 minutes. Hey, thanks for watching everybody. Yeah, I'm gone. Bye. I'll just turn it off. We've

6
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:27,159
been here for like 15-20 minutes or so. I do that every day. Nobody would watch this channel.

7
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:39,430
We wouldn't even get anything started. Okay, what are we doing? We're doing Dreams tonight.

8
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,530
This is Dreams Early Access. And those of you that know the Dreams is one of my most

9
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:56,390
anticipated video games of 2019. I want to play it. Please turn off the stream.

10
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,849
No, I know. Look, I know a lot. Here's the thing. I know a bunch of people say,

11
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,650
nah man, you could like paint a fence and I'd watch it. That's like the meme. That's the

12
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:14,870
joke, right? But imagine if I painted a fence every day. Eventually, after three or four full

13
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,710
houses in the neighborhood done, you'd start asking about something else. Ah, cool. You got

14
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,650
another painted fence in the neighborhood. That's cool. You're gonna play Devil May

15
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:36,139
Cry at any point? No, we're gonna do this like the next six months. Oh, um, all right, man,

16
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:45,750
like looking forward to it. Yeah, what if I built a birdhouse every stream? I mean, maybe

17
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,669
I would say at least 50% of people would be gone after the fifth birdhouse stream in a

18
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:56,870
row. All right, I haven't streamed in a while, so how do I do a tweet? Oh, like this.

19
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:14,680
Dreams and a couple of Zs. That sounds good to me. Zzz. That looks good. But yeah,

20
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:23,590
um, my time off was great. It was well spent with family. It was a great, relaxing time. It was

21
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:31,270
great to see everybody too. So I'm completely satisfied and I am ready to go back into the

22
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:39,319
virtual internet world of broadcasting. So what do you say we do that now? I'm gonna change

23
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:50,020
it over and here comes dreams. Let's load it. Why don't you stream with your mom? My mom

24
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:59,340
doesn't want to be on the screen. So again, this is dreams. This is a mix of I haven't played

25
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,949
it yet, so I can tell you maybe a little bit of a preface to this whole thing. I believe

26
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:13,379
that this is sort of a combination of 3D movie maker and tilt brush. That's kind of what I

27
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,459
gathered. All right, welcome intrepid creators. Before you get your hands on the creator

28
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,699
early access, we'd like to remind you of the following. Oh, we have a warning sign.

29
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,490
This is early access software. That means it's not the finished product. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,779
During early access, we may modify the software without I didn't get a chance to read it.

31
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:46,709
What? I want to read that. I want to go back and read that. Hey, do you want to allow your

32
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:52,040
pro? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Do you want to allow your user profile

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,069
and creations to be public on the web at in dreams.me? You can change this anytime in the

34
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:04,660
I mean, I guess. Yeah, we believe in giving credit where it's due, but we need your

35
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,779
explicit permission to do this. Would you like us to display your online ID alongside your

36
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:16,899
creations in any promotional videos or live streams? Well, my online ID isn't is not

37
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,970
me. It's like a made up name. So okay, let's just say that I create something here and it's

38
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,129
like the best thing that anyone's ever seen. It's gonna be my like fucked up shitty

39
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,769
PlayStation four name. It's not gonna be me. I'm giving credit to my stage name.

40
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:48,019
Um, but okay, who cares though, right? Because I know I did it and you all know that I did it.

41
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:59,240
So if it pops up anywhere that everyone will just know that doesn't matter. No,

42
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:12,180
I don't want to use my goddamn name. We're gonna get the intro video. Hello. Bonjour. Hola.

43
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:19,480
Ciao. Hello. This took the fill in too many people. Stop spawning people. You're gonna

44
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:31,529
crash the fucking server. Hello. I just got a hundred dollars. I haven't even been back

45
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:42,389
for five minutes. Uh, thank you to German wide about ace attorney. No, I didn't. All right.

46
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:50,579
Let me, I need to address that. I think this is like a big tutorial coming up here. Hold on.

47
00:06:51,139 --> 00:07:11,399
No movement, no sound, pleat emptiness. Then big band, a speck, an idea. The idea could be

48
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:21,300
anything. It could be, it could even be everything. No, not loud and coming. We're good.

49
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:30,779
Fight. Monochrome.

50
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,680
Any matter.

51
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,620
Silence. And most exciting of all.

52
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:59,100
Death. That's not, that's actually not exciting. Everyone can conduct this power.

53
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:08,180
Everyone has an imp. Imps are the tall guy. Wait, I can't, I'm not doing this anymore.

54
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,060
Teams with their energy, waiting for you to choose your very own. I have to make my own imp.

55
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:24,839
Choose your imp. Wait, hold on. Is this just a color? All right. Well, first of all, hold on.

56
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,279
I need to address something really important because I don't want to get flack for this

57
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,439
because people are going to be very upset with me and they're going to talk shit about

58
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,799
me on the internet forums. And I have no way to defend myself. I can only defend myself

59
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,210
when this stream is turned on. Think about that. Anyone says anything about me,

60
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,649
I have to, you have to wait till like my next live stream for me to repeat it and say,

61
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,129
and try to fight for my case. Germa lied about Ace Attorney gave a hundred dollars.

62
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,809
Thank you with a hundred bucks. That's an insane amount of money, but more importantly,

63
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,450
didn't lie about that. Told you I was going to play it off stream and decide if I wanted

64
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,690
to play it or not because I thought it was a different video game than what was initially

65
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,090
told to me by friends and family. But glad you had a great time with the family,

66
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,009
Germa. Even if you did lie, I'm happy to see you back and barely on time. Still on time.

67
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:12,299
That's why I have the window. Thank you. What do you think? Which TV? No,

68
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,580
what's my favorite color? Green. My favorite color is like in between here and here.

69
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:31,399
Probably green. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Some of you guys might not know

70
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,769
this. Maybe you do. I've been waiting for this game to come up for a fucking century.

71
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:41,850
Actually, that's almost hold the options button and your impulse snapped the center

72
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:50,820
of the screen. Okay. Yes. Great. Your imp responds to the smallest movements of your

73
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,899
wireless control. The sound of your voice. That's because it's attached to the

74
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,220
controller's motion sensor. Oh God, no. You only need to move the controller

75
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,379
a teeny tiny amount to get your imp to respond. Okay. Go on. Move your imp around

76
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:11,580
a bit. Think of the light bulb on the front of the controller as a flashlight beam

77
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,240
conducting your imp. I hope hopefully I can turn this off. You see that little cluster

78
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:25,850
of creativity. The creativity clusters. To touch it. I gotta like rest my hands down

79
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,409
on my brachial area. That's it. I don't want to drive a car. I don't know why

80
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,450
people like this. Those two clusters at the top and bottom. I don't like holding my hands

81
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,370
out like I'm driving a car. But when you drive a car, the wheel is big so you can rest

82
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:48,970
your forearms on it. This is like driving. Look, look, look. Motion controls are

83
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:56,250
cool. Motion controls are interesting. But I don't like driving a car for more

84
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:19,740
than four hours. I got it in one second. Watch this. Ready? I'm pretty good at it

85
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,100
though. I'm pretty good at it. Let's see if I can get like all the donuts in one swoop.

86
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:38,299
Ready? It's a symphony. What if this was the whole early access? See how your imp can affect

87
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:45,259
everything it touches. Welcome to dreams. Playing through the wilds of your imagination.

88
00:11:46,059 --> 00:12:01,720
Easy. You're wonderful. You're a dream, sir. Play this game on iPad. Sweet. Excellent.

89
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,240
Groovy. You found the wall of doubt. Don't worry. Everyone doubts themselves in the beginning.

90
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,759
I wasn't doubting myself. I was completely confident. Try using the pointy tip of your

91
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:22,980
imp to grab hold of it. How do you grab? R2. That was pretty, that was pretty ingenuitive.

92
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:32,789
That doesn't feel bad. Look at that brick. Who does it think it is? Get rid of it.

93
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:47,909
Did we do it? Your idea's getting away. Chase it down. Your idea. No, not my idea.

94
00:12:50,570 --> 00:13:00,179
Ah, shit. My idea was it was a jack in the box apparently. Is it gonna, is it a loot box?

95
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:11,460
No, it's not. Do I have to pay for ideas? It should be in here somewhere. The second we

96
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:18,019
start paying for our imaginations, that's when, that's when like the Illuminati government

97
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:31,399
control this one. I'm just gonna be clear about that. This is cute though. This is cute. Don't,

98
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:40,019
don't talk shit about this. Why did I pick green? I'm an idiot. Green is the symbol of

99
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:54,409
intelligence. It's the color of intelligence. The only source of energy is you. What can you

100
00:13:54,409 --> 00:14:00,490
do? It's not the color of idiots. Go take color theory and you tell me. You can possess.

101
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:10,870
Yellow is like anger. Red and like passion. Red is rage. Green is intelligence. Blue is

102
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:26,009
calmness. Look it up. I just like smash the light bulb. Three. Dream.

103
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:35,340
We have light. A good start. If only we had a way of exploring this place.

104
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,220
Let's see. Oh, I get to be a new character. Now we're really getting somewhere.

105
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,980
It's the X jumps. I don't, I'm confused. Oh, I get it. I get it guys. I get it.

106
00:14:53,539 --> 00:15:00,980
Listen to me. Listen. Quiet. Stop talking. Stop talking. Listen. So this whole thing

107
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,659
was made in dreams. Yeah. Everything you're seeing here was made in this game.

108
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay. Yeah. Brad. Brad. You and Mike have detention later. Okay. After school. My office.

109
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,549
And assholes. There must be some way to get out there. This whole thing was made

110
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,950
in dreams. I know it says that in the lower right headquarter. I know it does.

111
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:42,179
So it was a springboard. You got it. Great work. We're so close. I can't wait to make

112
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:53,370
my own video game. Oh, look at that seedling. The dream of us loves to help things grow.

113
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,490
Cool. Okay. So circle is to interact. Well, the circle is to get out. So how do I get in

114
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:07,799
there? All right. I have to use my hands. And then look at how shaky I am. Those of you

115
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,320
think I'm like making this shit up. Like how fucking weird I am and how fucked up I am.

116
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Like look at my hands.

117
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:36,279
All right. That's a rumble feature. Pretty good song though. How is he moving?

118
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:47,379
Oh, I need to pretend to jump too. Do I make more music?

119
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:58,419
Here at last. Dreams. Your vast, vibrant, sublime universe of possibilities. Let's start.

120
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:06,619
You know, 2020 hindsight, I should have brought a bed in here. And right when this turned on

121
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:17,559
here, it said dreams. Let's start. I should just got into bed on camera. How long? Ah,

122
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:26,039
this is your very own home space. Home space. Okay. You'll always start dreaming from here.

123
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:39,539
Interesting. All right. So where do we go? What's this? A prize bubble.

124
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:50,660
I have to collect the prize bubble. I could find more. Okay. You've got the difficulty of a

125
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,200
four-year-old Easter egg hunt here. I think I'll get them all. That was a staircase.

126
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:17,059
Loot bubbles. What is that? Tic-tac-toe? How do I get that one? Of course it's got a name

127
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:26,339
like the Dreamiverse. Okay. Where is it? Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Give me one second.

128
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,180
Maybe I unlock a bigger jump. Like a super jump or something. Or a double jump. I don't

129
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,849
think I get anymore. I think those are the predetermined ones that I'm allowed to get.

130
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:53,690
All right. Main menu. Dream surfing? Okay. Dream shaping or dream surfing? Should we check

131
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:03,779
out what people have made first? Let's see what's possible. Let's do some dream surfing. I

132
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,900
didn't get a chance to read that. Was that a disclaimer about it being like nudity or something

133
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:15,799
or like R rated material? I didn't get to see it. Dream surfing. Here we can explore the wilds

134
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:22,869
of the Dreamiverse. Slipping and sliding through the strangest and most wonderful ideas and

135
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:28,069
creations. I can't wait. This is going to be so cool. Lose yourself in the kaleidoscope of

136
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:34,869
games, animations, music videos. You can do anything. And all sorts of worlds and experiences

137
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:43,130
made by dreamers just like you. Dream surfing is a never ending, ever changing stream of

138
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:49,190
dreamers imaginations. Let's try it out. I can't wait. I think some of you are underestimating

139
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:56,519
how cool this game possibly could be. Final version art and voiceover added to the fun.

140
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:03,900
Okay. Oh, I thought that. All right. So this is just the version 1.01. All right. Let's go.

141
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:10,740
Okay. Dreams. Auto-surf. Play through a randomly selected taster of the Dreamiverse.

142
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:23,559
Um, what are you looking for? Game? Story? Showcase? Let's just do auto-surf. Get the

143
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:39,380
fastest time possible. It's a race? What the fuck? What? I don't understand what I'm supposed

144
00:20:39,380 --> 00:21:07,180
to do. This is really fast. Oh, no! It's like Super Mario Odyssey. Somebody's going to

145
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:15,579
make the entire Super Mario Odyssey in this game. Watch out. All right. I got crushed.

146
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:28,650
This is so cool. I won't make anything this cool. Shortcut. Mario Kart taught me this.

147
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:46,140
Oh, wait. Can you imagine when talented people actually play this game? What? What

148
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,700
I was wondering? Oh, I went right to the middle. I thought I could go in there. See,

149
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:58,339
I should be doing this like a speed run. How is that possible? That's not even possible

150
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:08,970
to do what I just did. That's not even possible. Oh, my God. I'm still trying to do it like a

151
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:34,019
speed runner. Turn on the edge. I did it. All right. That was cool. This is called Dreamiverse

152
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:40,180
Dad. I don't think that there are any created actual created things here. Thumbs up or

153
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:48,059
thumbs down? Rewind or skip? Uh, that was cute. I'll give it a thumbs up and then let's

154
00:22:48,059 --> 00:23:01,420
go. Skip, right? What? Follow for update. OK, so this is a first person shooter. Aim. Shoot.

155
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:32,549
Swap weapon. Reload. Crouch. Jump. Free aim. Uh, OK. Is he dead? Why does he look alive?

156
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,650
I don't know. But I'm going to keep going. What's the goal?

157
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:56,579
Is somebody hurting me? What is hurting me? Oh, Jesus. It's this guy. OK, he is

158
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:10,380
homing bullets. Same game made both of these. I can't wait to make my own. I'm going to spend

159
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,059
six months making my own thing. Remember I made the joke about painting the fences in

160
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:34,009
the beginning of the stream? Uh, hope you're ready for a fresh coat tomorrow. He's dead?

161
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:56,099
All right, I was going to run by. This is so weird. This is so weird. I think I died.

162
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,500
All right, I want to see more. Watch out the gap in the door. It's a separate reality. The only

163
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,220
me is you. Are you sure the only you is you? What's that from? That's from something in

164
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:23,210
particular. This is P.T. Somebody remade P.T.? No, they did not. No, that was it? Hold on,

165
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:31,210
that was the end? I didn't get to do it? I didn't get to play P.T. It was just the first

166
00:25:31,210 --> 00:26:00,569
door. Please hug me, this is called. This is called curiosity. Curiosity?

167
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:25,059
Uh, when everything is over, curiosity continues. Reach destination. Stay creative

168
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:38,549
and explore the unknown. Thank you Media Molecule for this game. This is fucking unbelievable.

169
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:56,809
I wonder how hard it is to use. It's a never-ending compilation of whatever anyone

170
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:12,650
wants it to be. Holy shit. I can run? Can I? I don't think I can run. I think I just have to get

171
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:27,079
there. Oops. So it's like a game engine that anyone can use. Yeah, but you don't have to make

172
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:33,930
a game. You can do anything. You can paint a picture. You can make an animation. You can make

173
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,769
a little cartoon. You can make a 2D cartoon. I'm pretty sure there's no limit to it

174
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:53,160
have to be a video game. I think I ran into an invisible wall. Uh, this one doesn't seem to be

175
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:04,150
done. Uh, I have to go. Wait, did I do the wrong thing? Should I have gone around another way?

176
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:16,359
Supposed to go up the mountain? Maybe. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR thanks to the five

177
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:24,259
community subs. Thank you. Appreciate it. Five more from Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Am I

178
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:32,680
gonna run into another wall here? Keep lying. It's how most of us stay subscribed.

179
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,390
But what happens when I get here? I gotta see the whole thing through, right?

180
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,349
I can't just go this far without touching the beam. I'll never be able to stay.

181
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:56,069
All right, you ready for my dramatic cry moment? I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna

182
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,470
power off before I touch it. I ran out of battery or something. That's what I would have

183
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:25,019
done. Made it. The journey is never completed. Ah, shit. Well, I didn't have to do that whole

184
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:36,470
thing. Well, that's the end of that one. All right, let's go loop one. Wait, why is it? Why?

185
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:46,839
Is this a different screen? We got the rope. Was that part of the same game?

186
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,039
This is a PT playlist and it just happens to be looping them in here.

187
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,039
This is fucking crazy. No way is this possible.

188
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,039
Kids game. I don't know if it's a kids game. It's an anything game.

189
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:41,349
The off-road lands. Chapter one. We're getting a bunch of random things. We should be getting them.

190
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,589
This is overwhelming how cool this is.

191
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:58,230
Oh, it's me. Well, let me get some of the letter grid because this car is... Oh my god,

192
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:05,049
I'm gonna make a car game. I can't wait to make a car game. It's coming through.

193
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:24,259
All right, somebody just flushed a toilet. I can't wait to make something.

194
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,380
But I don't want to jump into it yet. I'm gonna see more creation.

195
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:44,200
Uh, I went. Factor Majora's Menu. Galactic Adventures. Press X to start.

196
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,789
No, what's happening is it's giving me random...

197
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,509
There can't be that many to pull from right now because it's only gonna be a week.

198
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,470
His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom,

199
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,390
but reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.

200
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:37,750
Touch that dial now. We're just getting started because here comes the off-road lands.

201
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:48,900
Chapter two. So this is chapter two. So each level has to be its own loading area.

202
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,029
I can't wait to see how this connects to the PT universe.

203
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:38,789
The game is way too loud. I'll fix that. Am I just rolling down the hill? What the fuck?

204
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:54,650
I don't think that was supposed to happen. How do I just get out of here? Oh, I beat it.

205
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,450
Space pilot dogfight is this one. Oh shit. Cockpit you take off.

206
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:20,650
What? Wow, this is unbelievable. All right, quick. Somebody make Star Fox 2.

207
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:37,420
How do I lock on? What does it lock on? What does it circle?

208
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:46,940
What does enemy lock on? Who the hell has it locked on to? I want this one.

209
00:34:46,940 --> 00:35:18,809
How do I do like a flip roll? Too late. Doesn't she show up?

210
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,469
Don't you have to zoom in and look at stuff? I hear them calling to me from...

211
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:36,230
When his ten-year-old son came to investigate the commotion, the father shot him too.

212
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,909
The window is cut off. His six-year-old daughter had the good sense to hide in the bathroom.

213
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:44,230
Reports suggest he lured her out by telling her it was just a game.

214
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,389
The girl was found shot once in the chest from point-blank range.

215
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,230
The mother, who he shot in the stomach, was pregnant at the time.

216
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:58,469
Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car

217
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:02,230
listening to the radio. Several days before the murders...

218
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,750
Yeah, didn't she hang out in the corner or something?

219
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,469
...repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice.

220
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,230
They said it was like he was chanting some strange spell.

221
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,530
I think somebody made the whole game here.

222
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:18,250
Hey, here we go. Let's go to the new chapter three of The Off-Road Lens.

223
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:26,679
Mine's gonna be up here. I'm gonna make like the Teflon of the Lost Ark or something.

224
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:46,460
What? Oh, okay. Giant sword. Look at this shit.

225
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,780
This can't be that difficult to do, though, because that was the whole purpose of this

226
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:10,460
game. They spent a decade trying to make this game completely accessible and incredibly deep

227
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:19,719
at the same time. Watch us go there. It is insanely hard to use. No, no way.

228
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:24,059
So easy. A streamer could do it. That's true.

229
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,760
Hammer Panic. Two-player minigame.

230
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:38,380
Hammer Panic? What is this? Okay, so you're a little hammer guy.

231
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:41,429
Didn't this look like a TV show or a cartoon?

232
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,860
Hit objects and your opponent's colored light bulbs to score points.

233
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:09,480
And you can jump in this, too. Hit the objects into your opponent's backboard.

234
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:18,539
Okay, so it's like a game of soccer. I can't even win with nobody fighting me.

235
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:28,650
Ah, I see. They have weight, too. The graphics are beautiful, too. The graphics are really nice.

236
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:43,269
Make your opponent fall off. Oh, I haven't played this in Minecraft.

237
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:49,079
What's this called in Minecraft? It's called, like, Quip Blower or something. What's it called?

238
00:38:52,699 --> 00:39:13,820
That's Quiplash. Final results. Winner! End game. So you can make a little Mario party.

239
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:40,889
Here comes the bathroom loop. God damn it. I didn't want to play a horror game right now.

240
00:39:49,980 --> 00:40:25,780
Wait, what? I'm not doing this one. No.

241
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:37,320
And final chapter of the off-road lands. Yeah, it's truly off-road. It's off the cliff.

242
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:59,210
Well, this is not a boat. This is a car. Car is still running. I'm gonna make a city.

243
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:25,050
I'm gonna make GTA 6. What is... That's pretty scary.

244
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:46,230
What is that implying? What? No fucking way! They're gonna get sued.

245
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:56,469
So many people are gonna get sued. Don't sue me, though. I didn't do it.

246
00:41:57,269 --> 00:42:02,010
I'm just showcasing it. You can't get sued for, like, reporting the news, right? Like,

247
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:11,099
I'm just reporting the news. What do you mean wrong? Get the one up.

248
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,829
That guy hasn't played Mario 1.1 since that was, like, seven. Which one is it?

249
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,559
It's under here, right? Where is it? It's right here? I know it's right here somewhere.

250
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:39,539
Where is it? No, they didn't put that in here. They didn't program that in.

251
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:59,670
I can't run fast? No, it's going down. Oh, fuck. Oh, well. I'll get the...

252
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:13,059
There's gonna be... There's gonna be a one. I don't think it knows what to do.

253
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:27,500
Oh, Super Mario 1.1 was really fun. This is, like, look behind glitch.

254
00:43:52,539 --> 00:44:05,050
I did. Dark Souls inspired Dark Dungeon. Inspired by Dark Souls. So this is not a game.

255
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:39,190
This is gonna be just a piece of video. I can't wait for Jeremy to die to Pinwheel later in

256
00:44:39,190 --> 00:45:02,280
this game. This is called Main Menu. Press X to rock. So each screen is its own piece of

257
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:12,789
video. I want to rock so bad. Colored Notes will approach. This is Guitar Hero.

258
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:25,590
All right, let's play it. Don't touch that dial now. We're just getting started. Let's play Rock

259
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:35,099
On! What? Release the game for free and find someone who matches this... What the fuck was

260
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:50,059
that? That was a messed up loading screen. That was actually kind of scary. Is this a skateboard?

261
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,519
Holy shit. How do I steer it? I don't think I can steer this.

262
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:35,219
Oh god. It's too hard to stay on. I can't stay on this. Where's the camera? I don't know if I'm

263
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:48,420
still on it. Am I still on it? Yes, I still am. That was pretty cool. I need to make a

264
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,030
roller coaster or something. There are too many ideas flying around in my head at the same time.

265
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:19,670
Oh no. Holy shit, I actually got back on. I did it. Is there more? Is the whole level

266
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:29,139
coming down? I can't go off. I'm going off sideways. This is not how a skateboard works.

267
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:41,050
Just drifting off. Song list. I need to get out of here and do an actual play.

268
00:47:41,050 --> 00:48:03,239
Newsletter blues. Taking sizable sips from the creek of anguish. Yes. A Life Took Lemons game.

269
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:09,880
Slayer scrolls. Scene 0.5. Title card. You are a slayer. You take on contracts called scrolls

270
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:17,079
to slay men or beasts in exchange for gold. You have journeyed to the quaint stonewall town.

271
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:22,119
You enter the dwarf inn. The innkeeper here is specially adept at finding the best scrolls

272
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:54,119
offering the most gold. Slayer scrolls. I want to go do that. Am I getting booed?

273
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:17,179
I forget what it is. It's not even the real game and it's still scary.

274
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:26,980
This is not even the right one. This is a pretend version and it's still just as bad.

275
00:49:26,980 --> 00:50:07,429
Here we go. Slide. Is L1? Am I fucking Grover? Oh yes. I think I will take two scrolls.

276
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:20,619
Welcome to the dwarf inn, slayer. Do you have a scroll for me?

277
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:26,969
Always do, but before we get started, you should know there is an assassin here for you.

278
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:35,260
An assassin? Why did you let him in? He's got gold for ale, just like anyone else.

279
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,780
But a dead slayer in my inn is not good for business. I'll take care of it. Which one is

280
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:47,980
he? He's the fat one, hard to miss the lad. Remember slayer, no weapons in my inn. And keep

281
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:57,210
it quiet. A bar fighter's not good for business. I know I did mention the word Grover. That's the

282
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:03,340
guy that Grover always pisses off. That's the guy that goes to all of Grover's restaurants

283
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:10,570
and he fucks up his order every time. No, I wanted to have a slice of pizza. It's that guy.

284
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:21,510
No, I wanted, I didn't want spaghetti and meatballs. I wanted a pizza. Oh, I'm so sorry.

285
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:31,880
Where's the fat one? Oh, that guy, that's the fat one I think.

286
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:46,260
Is the guy fat or is he just a pear? Fill the assassin's drink with something deadly.

287
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,619
Another prompt. Dead? What is it saying? I can't read that.

288
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:16,980
Fill the, does it say dead? Why would they have a bucket of poison in here? Dip in sludge.

289
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:31,219
Here you go. Wait, there's two fat guys. No, it's not. Okay, here he is. Here you go.

290
00:52:46,900 --> 00:53:05,579
He's asleep. Okay, I did it, right? Do I win? Quick work, slayer. That was no assassin.

291
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:11,099
What scroll do you have for me? This scroll comes from the Lord of Frostburg. A dragon

292
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:17,420
plagues the northern mountains. The Lord's knights have burned, have burned alive by

293
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:23,510
its fiery breath. Slay the dragon, bring the dragon's tooth. I can't wait to do that

294
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:47,829
after we get jumpscared again by PT. I think I just leave. Leave Dwarf Inn. Oh, god damn it.

295
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:22,630
Thank god we got the slayer scrolls seen too. This is actually really, really cool looking.

296
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:33,139
I think they had to sculpt these people too. So I have to go fight the dragon?

297
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:47,610
Is there a sprint? Yeah, right here. Giant snowman. I don't have a sword, though. Swing

298
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:58,250
sword. I don't have one. I can't wait for the 3D undertale to be made in this, you know what

299
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:12,460
I'm saying? Let's go out the door. It already exists? You gotta be kidding me. I think there

300
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:26,489
already is one. Well, great. Will they let me out? Where do I get one of those?

301
00:55:27,449 --> 00:56:21,579
Oh, no. I should get this one. This one should be pretty easy. Fuck! How does one even make this

302
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:50,099
in this game, though? What do I want to make? We're gonna go with like three or four dog shit

303
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:54,820
things, and then I'm gonna get the real idea that I'm gonna spend the next six months on.

304
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:08,280
Make the Grover pizza thing. You want to make the scene from Sesame Street

305
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,440
where Grover fucks up the Muppet's food. That's what you want me to do.

306
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:38,760
You want me to spend at least three to four streams on this. Do it. But without the voices,

307
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:50,980
it doesn't make- I have to do text. I'm gonna have to get a transcript of that scene from

308
00:57:50,980 --> 00:58:10,900
Sesame Street. This is a long song. How long does this last? 100,000 points. One, two,

309
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:17,579
three, four, five stars. Oh, that's all right. That's a restaurant worth going to on Yelp.

310
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:23,190
Yelp is fucking tough. It's really hard. How many times do I have to keep doing this one?

311
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:28,469
Did I not do the completion thing to do- to not have to do this one?

312
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:37,019
I think this is where the- whoever's making this, I think this is where they left off.

313
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:50,420
Slayer Scrolls scene 2.5. After days of journey, you arrive at the northern mountains.

314
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,500
As you climb the mountain, you reach a clearing. A dwarf waits here,

315
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:01,750
a axe in his hand, and a slain man below him. I don't want to do any more of these songs.

316
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:22,789
Okay, listen up, and don't you move. Need to take a piss? Hold it. I've got just 60 seconds

317
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:29,639
to go. I gotta mess all you folks out there in radio land. So sit tight and bend an ear.

318
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:35,400
Now's the time for action. Our society is rotten to the core. I'm talking to all the fine

319
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,039
upstanding folks got their wet hair cut. Southern jobs pulled out from under us.

320
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:44,920
Yeah, you. You know what to do. Now's the time. Do it.

321
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,679
Imagine what we actually got for this game.

322
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:11,059
There we go. Wait, is that- that's my sword? My sword is very clearly a leg.

323
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:18,230
I just do a sidewards kick.

324
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:57,000
Here it all started when I was nine. Lost my parents in a mining accident. Growing up on

325
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,199
the streets of Dwarf Hold made me an angry man and a deadly one. Well, thanks for listening

326
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:09,909
to this dwarf's tale. Go on your way now and let me ponder my ways. What did I get? Why

327
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:55,739
am I red now? You're dead? Let's go. Fight the dragon. No. I gotta make something fucking

328
01:01:55,739 --> 01:02:23,349
wild. Skip it? No, I can't skip it yet. Oh god. Wait. What? Wait, it didn't even give me a chance.

329
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:52,340
Oh god damn it. Do I have to actually do something here? Is it with the clock?

330
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:06,039
Hello. Yeah, R3 doesn't zoom in anymore.

331
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:39,989
Don't. Don't press X. I think I did it. No, I didn't. What other shit do I have to press?

332
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:52,019
Don't you have to find like photos? Yeah, I'm-

333
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:16,550
Shot once in the chest from point blank range. The mother who he shot in the stomach was pregnant

334
01:04:16,550 --> 01:04:22,860
at the time. Police arriving on scene after neighbors called 911 found the father in his car

335
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:28,219
listening to the radio. Several days before the murders, neighbors say they heard the

336
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:33,900
father repeating a sequence of numbers in a loud voice. They said it was like he was chanting

337
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:48,230
some strange spell. You reach a valley on the mountainside, the smell of smoke and ash fills

338
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:54,360
your lungs. The presence of fire would be comfort for your cold hands if it did not signal that

339
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,300
a dragon is stirring. Piercing screech of a dragon causes you to slip off a cliff and

340
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:18,170
drop your sword. What the fuck? Boy, what you looking at is the name of this. Oh,

341
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:29,050
it's the gyro to lean. This is stupid.

342
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,980
The following is an early visual concept created on Dreams.

343
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:56,619
Metro. Cinematic camera. Real-time footage running on the bubble bath engine.

344
01:05:57,659 --> 01:06:11,929
That's what this is called. Bubble bath engine. I don't think there's anything else here.

345
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:20,230
I think it's just a little concept. Follow more. Follow for more content. I'm not following

346
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:26,900
anybody. I cannot move. This is just a static representation of what they're developing at

347
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:44,699
the moment. Boy, you. What you looking at? What you looking at? All right. Well, that's cool.

348
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:56,789
Here we go. Dragon boss fight. This is the holy shit. Oh my God. I can't wait.

349
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:10,599
This is the ending of Slayer Scrolls. You know when you're watching TV on the couch

350
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,360
and there's three or four shows on at the same time that you want to watch?

351
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,539
This is just channel surfing back and forth between those channels.

352
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,820
It's like, oh, I really want to see who gets chopped next, but I also want to see what happens

353
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:32,409
to Garfield. This goes to commercial and you change to the other show. What down to the

354
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:50,760
Patriots right now? Let's go find out. What was that? Take apple. Oh, he's going to burn

355
01:07:50,760 --> 01:08:12,039
the forest down. What do I do? How do I kill him? I only have a sword. He's got a thousand health.

356
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:39,420
I got him. Where are you going? What am I going? What is he doing?

357
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:49,350
I got it. Take the dragon tooth. I completed the game.

358
01:08:58,069 --> 01:09:09,689
Ah, this is the... Are you kidding me? Look at this sculpting job. This is so cool.

359
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:46,090
This really is a dream version of this level. Anything else I can do? Can I open any doors? I

360
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:54,020
think these are all different ways to go and we'll do a new screen. Book of the dragon.

361
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:33,689
Dude, this is so cool. What needs to be connected here? Alba blue.

362
01:10:33,689 --> 01:11:06,340
That's it, right? No, something's wrong there. I can't read this. What does it say?

363
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:16,649
You've carried the dragon's tooth and made... Was that part of the book of dragons?

364
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:23,430
When you arrive the gates don't open for you like usual. Guards come outside to confront you.

365
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:38,970
They don't look too pleased to see you. The portal demo? Face direction of portal.

366
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:42,970
Maintain current direction. Uncap velocity. Cap velocity.

367
01:11:51,899 --> 01:12:09,050
Is it supposed to be a portal gun? Oh, okay. R1. So it works. It technically works.

368
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:31,289
It's these little pancakes. Okay, so let's go like this. I'm not sure there is a win

369
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:54,380
condition here. It looks like a test. Do a loop. All right, I'll do a loop. No, no,

370
01:12:54,460 --> 01:13:10,460
get in there. Oh wait, I can do it. Right, it's portal. You can just do a loop like this.

371
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:33,050
Wait, what? Can I now do a loop? Yeah, I can't do it on the ceiling. I'm trying just to fall

372
01:13:33,050 --> 01:14:02,020
through. No, I... Oh, oh. I'm not sure this is gonna work. That's enough of that.

373
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:22,739
PlayStation Home Studio. Side table? Sit. Didn't they turn PlayStation Home off

374
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:37,479
completely forever? This is cool. You can just make this. Oh, you can actually move

375
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:46,979
things around. Interesting. I feel like you can make your own little apartment. Cool.

376
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:51,220
All right, we'll do a few... finish Slayer Scrolls.

377
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,579
You're no longer allowed inside Stonewall Town. What foolishness is this? I've been

378
01:14:55,579 --> 01:15:00,619
traveling to Stonewall for ages. A fortnight ago, a slayer burned Icevale Village to the

379
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:06,140
ground. Every man, woman, and child was slain. Slayers are no longer allowed in Stonewall.

380
01:15:11,739 --> 01:15:15,260
Stonewall is a beautiful village. I would never bring harm to it. I'm not a slayer.

381
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:22,500
You can't judge me on the actions of others. You are right. You have done good by this town

382
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:33,800
in the past. I will let you in, but make it quick. I think every option worked. Cuphead.

383
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:53,350
Dreams Edition. What? Are you serious? How do I shoot? Get... press while moving to get going.

384
01:15:53,350 --> 01:16:01,050
Hold L2 to focus in and use R2 to give him hell. Press L3 to pop a squat for

385
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:42,359
the blueberries. What does that mean? Kill it! Kill them! It takes a lot of hits. Die!

386
01:16:46,069 --> 01:17:06,170
All right, I need to get the coins. You can dash. You can jump and dash, right? Anybody else?

387
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:28,819
Oh, it's the tutorial level. Die! There's too many hits! I'm shooting them a million

388
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:59,850
times! All right, where's the end? I see a heart over there. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

389
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:07,699
Oh, there it is. He's too short. I can't hit him. Oh, this is bad.

390
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:25,859
Oh, shit. Too many. Pop the squat. Yeah, that's right.

391
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:34,460
Do I have to collect all the coins? Oh, did you actually just hit me?

392
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:51,369
All right, I don't know if there's an end. This is really, really cool though.

393
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,420
I think I might have to just collect everything. That's awesome. You know,

394
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:04,890
get that one a thumbs up. They didn't make Cuphead. This is called the encounter.

395
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,760
Disclaim it. The following level is a demo for an upcoming project planned for

396
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,319
production after the release of Dreams. Currently being worked on so you might

397
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:32,310
experience minor bugs or glitches. Enjoy. Okay. Bigsurf77 presents chapter one, The

398
01:19:32,310 --> 01:20:03,720
Encounter. That looks like a space station base of some sort, right? Guns or anything?

399
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:13,930
I don't think so. Oh, there you are. Yeah, I think it's time to finally leave this space station.

400
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:23,109
Oh, that's nice. Oh, fuck, I forgot it's a robot in a video game after the 2012.

401
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:44,920
There's something weird is going on and we better hurry. Hold on, I'll open the door for

402
01:20:44,920 --> 01:21:02,550
you. The password was Olympic Banana. What a weird password. So it's just me and you, huh?

403
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:08,789
He was doing hunt and peck. What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that.

404
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:30,819
Open it manually in the control room. Control room's on the left. Okay, what about over here?

405
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:53,380
Anything? This is pretty well made. Can I do this? There we are, the control room.

406
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:07,979
I don't remember that there were that many buttons. So press the button that activates

407
01:22:07,979 --> 01:22:15,220
what? This? Let's see. It can't be that difficult, right? Oh, well, is this a job

408
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:31,350
for you or a job for me? Who does this? This is your sub sound. It kind of is. All right,

409
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:44,340
we'll press it. Well, it's my fault. There's going to be a monster right here when he turns

410
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,220
the lights on. It's going to be scary. Watch this. I told you. Lights go on.

411
01:22:53,640 --> 01:23:02,890
No, unfortunately. At least the door is open now, I guess. Anyway, let's hurry.

412
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,869
Okay, let me ask you guys a question. How much money do you think I could make

413
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:20,920
if I just did that? Like this. If I was cute robot in horror game, do you think I'd make

414
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:30,100
some money? Do you think I would get if anyone would want that? I mean, it would

415
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:46,569
clearly just be a guy going like, but would it be cute? It might be. This is open. Can I

416
01:23:46,569 --> 01:24:11,210
look through there? Between four and fifteen dollars. That's not very much. Here we go. That's

417
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:21,670
the ship. Let us get out of here. Well, it's not called the encounter because nothing.

418
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:30,039
The playable demo ends here, but I would be updated soon. Oh, it is. So that is the end.

419
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:41,859
Carrot7, thanks for the five community subs. Thank you, Carrot7. So this is just a demo of

420
01:24:41,859 --> 01:24:52,149
what's coming. I mean, this is a pretty well made space station. It really was. You know,

421
01:24:52,149 --> 01:25:07,539
come on. I gotta rate these. Hello? Why can I not move? That was good. Here we go. Slayer

422
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,300
scenes. There's so many of these. Eat apple swing sword.

423
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:23,539
Dwarf orders no slayers allowed in the inn. Everyone is afraid of slayers ever since that

424
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:30,979
lunatic burned an entire village. The dwarf says having you inside his inn is not good for

425
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:39,000
business. Well, what do I do now? I have a scroll to complete. If you ask me, you should

426
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,960
win back the favor of this town. There's plenty of people here who could use your help.

427
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,920
If the people like you, the dwarf would have no reason to keep you out. I have a feeling that

428
01:25:52,920 --> 01:26:05,079
this is very long. This one is a real passionate person that has 40 or 50 different screens here.

429
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:19,510
Town favor zero out of five. Can I talk to townspeople? Oh, they have quest markers.

430
01:26:20,069 --> 01:26:32,439
That's the how to train the dragon guy. All right, I've never seen how to train the dragon

431
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:38,279
before. Any of the movies. But every trailer I ever watched, I was always curious. And

432
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:41,640
somebody explain to me maybe if it makes sense or not. I don't know. I just, I didn't get it.

433
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Why is the main, why does the main character talk like this? Is there a reason for that? I

434
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,220
don't know. The rest of the cast is like this. And they're talking. Oh, my friend,

435
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:00,300
you can't be you can't be serious. Well, you know, it's just me, the main character.

436
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:07,289
Is there a reason why that is? I just I didn't know. I thought it was there some reason for

437
01:27:07,289 --> 01:27:25,909
it is to make him out of place. Oh, yeah, I just didn't know if he was like from a different

438
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:35,369
land or something. Because he's a pathetic weak dweeb like you. What? I don't talk like I

439
01:27:35,369 --> 01:27:45,180
don't talk like that. Do I talk like this? No, I talk like this. I have a strong voice,

440
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:50,779
a powerful voice, a voice that commands a voice that demands. You know what I'm saying?

441
01:27:52,069 --> 01:28:00,409
My voice is strong. Hey there, Mr. Slayer Slayers are brave, aren't they? Yes, we are.

442
01:28:06,729 --> 01:28:13,859
I wish I was brave. But since you are, can you help me do something brave? Get on with

443
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:19,109
it. I don't have all day. I'm ready to help. Sure. What do you need? I want you to tell

444
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:29,819
this girl that I like her. She's easy to find. She's the prettiest of them all. How is this?

445
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:36,680
I'll tell her but you have to be more specific. Fine. But all you peasants dress the same

446
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:43,720
and look the same to me. You have to be more specific. She's playing by the other snowman.

447
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:54,060
All right. Okay, Toothless. Let's go find ourselves an adventure to go on, Toothless.

448
01:28:54,859 --> 01:29:14,010
Where's the other snowman? That's not her, right? Where's the other snowman? No,

449
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:16,729
do you have a quest marker? There's too many quest markers. I need to focus.

450
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:33,699
Other snowman. The lady with the pretzel? The lady with the yogurt dip pretzel? No, I don't

451
01:29:33,699 --> 01:30:01,220
think so. Where's the other snowman? Skip this one. No, it was a gunshot. Someone just shot a rifle.

452
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:14,600
This is going to take forever. Just hold on. Just wait, wait, wait. There it is. There,

453
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:21,590
there, there, there, there. You haven't even completed one out of five. They're all going to

454
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:37,859
be very quick. Oh, I like him too. Thank you for telling me. You have another mission to do?

455
01:30:38,420 --> 01:31:05,909
Was she going over there? This feels really weird being a fucking adult here.

456
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:15,319
You know what? I don't want to be over here. All right, I'm going to go this way.

457
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:26,100
Oh, you two like each other? That's cool. I'm just going to sit here and just watch.

458
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:34,569
Get out of here, dude. Fuck off. What's this guy? Hey there, buddy. You look like someone

459
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:40,729
who can help me. I left a valuable on the roof of my house. Can you grab it?

460
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:47,500
You got it up there, you can get it down. How do I get up there?

461
01:31:50,680 --> 01:32:04,380
I appreciate your help, slayer. Is this your house? Yeah, I just- that's right, that's right.

462
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:11,460
I just killed a dragon and instead of being led into the village, I have to play matchmaker

463
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:23,500
for like eight-year-olds and get a frisbee off of a roof. Can't make this? Oh, right

464
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:38,500
here. I can't skip this one, guys. Don't you understand? I can't. Shit. How do I crouch?

465
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:57,300
What is wrong with your house? God damn it. Why would you build it like this? Why would this guy

466
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:10,140
have his house like this? Is it gonna take an hour? No, it's not. This is a really well-made

467
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:17,859
experience, but this guy's house definitely shouldn't be built like this. He has just like

468
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:28,569
a weird stairway to the top of his house. Take- it's actually a bottle boot. All right,

469
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:34,390
well here you go. I'm gonna- I'm gonna jump and press fucking R1 and hope I fucking slash

470
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:54,020
him. Thank you, Slayer. Please don't tell my wife. No, I'm not Mr. Meeseeks. I'm gonna get this

471
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:58,949
one done. How did that get on the roof? Yeah, he just grabbed it by the handle and like

472
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:15,100
he threw it as hard as he could up there. Look at me. God damn it. Look at me.

473
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:26,060
I've been chasing my dog for hours. Could you help me catch him? Usually I kill wild

474
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:32,229
beasts like your dog. Why would you say that? He's fast. I have gone dizzy running in circles.

475
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:53,020
He's right behind you. Where'd he go? Just grab him. He's right next to you. Grab him.

476
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:09,819
He just hit his head on the wall. Come here. I'm just gonna wait in his path.

477
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:25,619
His AI path goes this way. I'm just gonna wait there. Get him? Thank you. I'll make

478
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:37,260
sure he behaves. All right, only two more. You put- I tripped him. Yeah, I stuck my leg out.

479
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:49,510
I did like a Tom and Jerry. I can't go- no, that's where I need to go.

480
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:11,579
Drink the snow. You can't drink the snow. Where's the last two quests? There was one

481
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:19,750
up here, right? I know. This is not supposed to be a Slayer Scrolls stream. I'm aware of

482
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:30,380
that but that's what it's turning into but I just have to know what happened. It's the

483
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,619
dwarf, right? Did I kill this guy?

484
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:51,829
Yes, I killed him. Yeah, so there was a dragon up there. Maybe that got him.

485
01:36:51,829 --> 01:36:55,510
Yes, I think he regretted his life of crime and left for a new life. You are the first

486
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:08,039
dwarf I've seen in years. There was a dragon up there. I think the dragon may have got him.

487
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:15,079
So he really is dead. I always knew his life of crime will end this way. I'll miss him

488
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:22,520
but I'm glad you told me. I needed closure. Without him, I've decided to use my axe for

489
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:35,210
honest work instead. Good. Look, I killed him. The dragon killed him. Somebody killed him.

490
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:52,630
That's all he needs to know, right? Doesn't matter if I killed him or not. He's been

491
01:37:52,630 --> 01:38:05,430
killed. Yes, it does. Yeah, but he was a criminal. He just, okay, he killed somebody.

492
01:38:06,069 --> 01:38:10,470
He literally robbed a guy and murdered him and I got vengeance for that person that he was

493
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:26,010
robbing and killing. Does it really matter if I got him or the dragon did? I heard you've

494
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:33,140
been helping the people of this town, Slayer. I need your help too. Oh, by the way, I'm a

495
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:41,300
Slayer. I'm not a negotiator. I'm a Slayer. It's in my name. It's in my first name.

496
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:54,810
Monsters have shown up in the crypt below town. The other guards have sealed it shut

497
01:38:55,449 --> 01:39:01,779
but I keep worrying what will happen if they get out. To be honest with you,

498
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:08,739
being the first woman of the town guard, I feel like I have to prove myself.

499
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:24,579
We're both going in. Yeah, let's both go in. Follow me. Do I have a weapon? I don't even

500
01:39:24,579 --> 01:39:44,579
have a weapon. Can I have a sword? We have to go down into the crypt. Oh, shit. Oh,

501
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:57,770
we have a new card now. Spring forest. This is where we went. This almost looks hand painted.

502
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:07,060
Gun blood. Point your gun in the air when ready. Aim. Fire. What? Wait, wait, wait,

503
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:28,250
wait, wait, wait, wait. Aim. Okay. So, aim. Enemy AI is activated. Connective. Was that just?

504
01:40:44,329 --> 01:41:05,640
What? Hey, you didn't give me a second. Oh my god.

505
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:41,100
Okay, come on, please. He's so much faster than I am. Did it. Okay, I won. Slayer scrolls.

506
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:44,779
Enter the crypt. This crypt is older than the town. It has been here for ages. Now,

507
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:49,260
all of a sudden, the dead in the crypt have risen. I can't imagine what will happen to

508
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:59,239
the town if they get out. We will clear the crypt of these monsters. Did she just get crushed?

509
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:33,989
Did we both die? No. A little place in outer space. Is that it? L1. This is trippy. What the

510
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:52,409
hell? Oh, I just have to activate all the objects? This really is Mario Galaxy. Yeah,

511
01:42:52,409 --> 01:42:56,220
this one, this one's really, really awesome. This is really cool, but it's gonna, I'm

512
01:42:56,220 --> 01:43:31,260
gonna throw up if I keep playing it. It's gonna go slow. What the fuck? Is that where I just,

513
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:37,699
whoa. Don't look up. Don't look up. Ever. They always say don't look down, but in these 3D

514
01:43:37,699 --> 01:43:55,449
spherical games, don't look up. Did I make it all the way back around? This is wild. Which

515
01:43:55,449 --> 01:44:05,800
way is up? I don't know. Ready to go home? Yes, I'm tired. Slayer scrolls, scene eight.

516
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:20,500
Crypt fight. We still live. All right, we ready? Where's, um, where's my companion?

517
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:50,550
Did she get crushed by the rocks? Holy shit. Oh, they're coming to life off the walls. Those

518
01:44:50,550 --> 01:45:26,619
eyes are terrifying. Where are you? Behind me? Shit. The music for this stuff is just baked in.

519
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:39,819
Wait, that's her. Where have you been? I was so scared. I hid over here. I am sorry,

520
01:45:39,819 --> 01:45:49,319
Slayer. I am just not strong enough to be a guard. The other guards left this threat under

521
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:54,600
the town. You are stronger than the rest to have come down here. If it helps, all you guards are

522
01:45:54,600 --> 01:46:11,800
puny cowards, not just you. That's so, well, yeah, that dialogue, that's just so mean and

523
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:17,420
rude. Okay, we've been nice the whole time. Let's see what the, what the rude path is.

524
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:45,930
Oh, I killed a monster. I can't wait to tell everyone. Crossing over. I can't wait to tell

525
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:59,800
all my friends I did it. I slayed a skeleton. Ultra realistic FPS prototype. Okay, ultra

526
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:16,250
realistic. Hold it. Inspect weapon. So this is ultra realistic. Eliminate the target at apartment

527
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:26,659
24 lane. You got it. The story continues after launch. Make sure you mark this one. 24 lane.

528
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:35,800
24 lane. There's an invisible wall here. I can't go any further. It's 24 lane. 24?

529
01:47:47,770 --> 01:48:06,300
I think that means that it's not done. 24 lane is not available yet. I can't, I don't

530
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:17,560
think I can shoot the gun. No, there's an invisible wall. Oh, just you wait. When this

531
01:48:17,560 --> 01:48:40,539
launches. Upstairs window. Oh, I can't even fire the gun. Window, window, window, what?

532
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:56,060
What do you mean window? Door, window, door, window. I can't shoot the gun. Whoa, whoa!

533
01:48:56,699 --> 01:49:02,680
That's a person's head, right? With their ears. He's looking out the window right

534
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:29,859
now. See his ears? Fucking controller aim. My god. Beautiful stone wall town. No, it can't

535
01:49:29,859 --> 01:49:37,020
be. Wait, they've burnt the town? Who burnt the town to the ground? This is really, really raging.

536
01:49:40,170 --> 01:50:04,069
It can't be. Don't walk through the fire. Um, what do we, how do we, what do we do? Um,

537
01:50:04,069 --> 01:50:22,140
do I have to jump it? Can we talk? Fight the fire. I don't, I don't even have a

538
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:33,460
sword anymore. Is that, is there another exit? Eat an apple. That didn't do anything.

539
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:45,859
Oh, it gave me extra health. Uh, I think we may have gotten to the end of this one.

540
01:50:46,500 --> 01:51:07,289
Didn't I kill the dragon? No. Right through her head.

541
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:14,600
I heard there might be a fellow slayer in stone wall. I expected more from you,

542
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:19,960
but thank you. Slaying a slayer always brings me great pleasure. Nice rhyme.

543
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:27,779
She sells slayers on the seashore. Slayers and pleasure. I want you to know slayer as

544
01:51:27,779 --> 01:51:32,739
much as joyous I get from this massacre. I do not think do die out to this for fun.

545
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:53,779
This was all written on a scroll. Holy shit. That's insane looking. What a twist. Yeah.

546
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:06,279
That's really, really awesome looking. Okay. I, uh, cone ball. I need to,

547
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,880
this is too much fun though. It's too interesting. We got to make something.

548
01:52:10,859 --> 01:52:18,149
Even if it's something stupid. Move, jump, charge. Released when charged to slam.

549
01:52:18,149 --> 01:52:28,310
Jump and slam down for extra power. Move, jump, and then charge. Okay. Goals to win.

550
01:52:28,869 --> 01:52:47,029
Here we go. Oh, fuck. Hold on. Slayer scrolls. By life took lemons. The saga has

551
01:52:47,029 --> 01:53:06,939
only begun. I can't wait for slayer scrolls 2 to come out. I have a cone ball. Let's go.

552
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:28,310
After credit screen. Three, two, one. Action. Oh, I'm red. I thought I was blue. Didn't I

553
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:48,100
select blue? I selected blue. This is just rocket league or soccer. Not everything is

554
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:53,300
rocket league. Rocket league is based off of playing soccer. So have I really become one

555
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:58,180
of those like millennials that doesn't even say the name of the thing that it is. I reference

556
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:06,229
to like, it's rocket league. This is not rocket league. It's football. God damn millennials.

557
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:20,359
Millennials calling shit when it's not supposed to be called. That doesn't,

558
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:25,079
that doesn't count. Look, if I, if I play basketball and I go under the hoop and I throw

559
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:33,539
it up, so it goes under the bottom of the net. It's not a basket. Fucking millennials.

560
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:51,079
What is this called? Polarity. Press X to start. I thought X jumped. Apparently not.

561
01:54:51,079 --> 01:55:09,720
X turns you blue. Press X to repel from blue platforms. Oh, press circle to repel from red

562
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:32,970
platforms. This is really interesting though. This is neat. I can't wait to make something

563
01:55:32,970 --> 01:56:05,300
neat like this. How do I get that? Nice. All right. This is going to be odd. Finish.

564
01:56:05,939 --> 01:56:21,930
Paddle extreme ultra DX. No way. This even pong. I'm not very, I'm not going to pong.

565
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:38,100
I told you. This is just rocket league. Oh cool, dude. You're playing pixel rocket league.

566
01:56:42,949 --> 01:56:45,989
No, no. You call it what it's supposed to be called and that's pong.

567
01:56:51,899 --> 01:56:56,220
It's not pong though. You're using the boomer rocket league terminology.

568
01:56:56,220 --> 01:57:01,739
I know. I'm aware of this. It's tennis, but we called it pong when I was 12.

569
01:57:02,539 --> 01:57:25,079
Just kidding. Can I just go once on this guy? You know, a friend of mine actually taught me

570
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:30,760
how to play pong well and it's hard to do, but actually it's pretty good tactic. You should

571
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:35,880
never look on the right side of the screen when you play pong. You should only be looking on your

572
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:40,520
side of the screen. That is what I was told to do and it actually is the way you're supposed

573
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:45,800
to play because it makes it so you can adjust very, very quickly. Never look at what the

574
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:49,960
ball's doing on their side of the screen, but you know, that's not, that's a great tip

575
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:59,270
actually. Somebody said that was a bad tip. No, it's not. This person that told me this by the way

576
01:58:00,789 --> 01:58:05,029
never lost one game of pong. They could go for like four hours. They had like one of those

577
01:58:05,029 --> 01:58:09,590
high scores where it was like a two to three hour long experience. This is all made up.

578
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:13,270
None of this is true, but take my word for it that you should be looking at your side

579
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:22,520
of the screen and it's okay. I'm just gonna go this way. Marvel us. Marvelous.

580
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:27,539
Oh, I get it. This one's called I.

581
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:47,449
All right. I like we're getting these terms of service. End user license agreements.

582
01:58:50,329 --> 01:59:07,140
Don't fade into the dark. Reach for the light. Created by disarmed. Move.

583
01:59:20,949 --> 01:59:32,170
Gun. Added to inventory. Inventory. Um, okay. Neural chip and weapon pistol.

584
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:39,380
R1 is flashlight. Wizz gun. Your health is represented by the health stability.

585
01:59:40,619 --> 01:59:44,060
Maintain this by using health objects you find. If it goes below red, you will die.

586
01:59:45,239 --> 02:00:10,619
Use your ammo wisely. Okay. New path unlocked. Environment. Green grass groove.

587
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:26,470
Oh no. But it's just a ball. Green grass groove. Sonic. It's just a sonic meatball.

588
02:00:38,069 --> 02:00:42,550
Pretty good job with the sounds though. And I like the terrain. Good job with the terrain too.

589
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:49,770
All right. It's a time to start to start to make something. I want to see what I just want

590
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:57,029
to check out the tools and it's time. We got to get pretty good taste. We'll do one more

591
02:00:57,029 --> 02:01:03,180
after this. Can I do any other moves like sonic moves? You know like the sonic dash and

592
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:14,979
shit on his chest. I need 15 coins to open this. What the hell is that? Wait, did I just

593
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:33,420
unlock that? I think I just actually that's mine now. All right. Let's take a look what we can do.

594
02:01:36,819 --> 02:01:55,220
Last one. This is called 2. So we need to see this. Find the code for the keypad. Hold L1

595
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:12,579
to sprint. I don't think I want to do that. That kind of hurts my head. This is so cool.

596
02:02:12,579 --> 02:02:28,439
This is even possible though. Do I have any bullets? Pain killers. Oh, I'm stable now.

597
02:02:30,729 --> 02:02:36,489
Can motion blur be turned off? Well, this is on PS4. I don't know if it can. Let's see. My

598
02:02:36,489 --> 02:02:52,039
preferences. Display. Visual feedback. Menu position prompts. Accessibility. Controls. No,

599
02:02:52,039 --> 02:03:01,770
it's PS4. As we all know, you cannot really change any graphical options on the PlayStation 4.

600
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:32,300
Or any console for that matter. It's just locked in. It is locked in. Where do I go here? What is

601
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:48,279
this? Power? Power to what? Well, it looks like we're going to follow this. Yeah, this is PS4

602
02:03:48,279 --> 02:04:05,800
only. Can I pull this chain? Can I just interact with the door? I can't interact with

603
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:28,869
the chain. Oh, the keypad. I don't have the key code. The game already exists on PC. It's

604
02:04:28,869 --> 02:04:37,979
called Unity. Yeah, but like, you'll see when we actually get to the creating aspect of it.

605
02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:46,359
It's not, I mean, it is a game engine, but it's not at the same time. It's also like an

606
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:56,229
art set. It's like painting and sculpting and I can't go over here. It's like a little big

607
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:59,350
planet 4. It's like they took a little big planet and said, you know what, let's make

608
02:04:59,350 --> 02:05:17,500
this 10 times more elaborate. Turn on. Well, new path unlocked. All right. Well, what the

609
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:40,229
hell is that? Connected. Is it like a monster now? All right. It's time. Oh, all right. Here we go.

610
02:05:40,229 --> 02:05:46,090
Perfect timing. Auto surf complete. You experienced 30 creations. Let us know what

611
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:52,979
you thought to help us with future surfing. Oh, okay. We can go through and rate them.

612
02:05:56,859 --> 02:06:00,699
I remember this. This is, we already had this one. What was this one? This one was pretty

613
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:10,869
cool. What does it say? This has been thumbed up 14,000 times. PT. I'm going to

614
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:19,300
give PT thumbs up, but not all the PTs. Please hug me. That was cool. Uh, curiosity. Curiosity

615
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:23,779
was really, really technically well done, but the game there was a little just, I don't know.

616
02:06:23,779 --> 02:06:34,600
I think I already rated this one. I forget what this one even was. Oh, this one. I like that

617
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:42,649
one. Yeah. Thumbs up that one. Super Mario got a thumbs that one up. Dark dungeon, dark soul.

618
02:06:42,649 --> 02:06:47,619
Yeah. Let me through the thumbs that one up. This is the guitar hero one. Yeah, that was

619
02:06:47,619 --> 02:06:55,619
good. Ramp 3D. I don't know. Yeah, no, it was good. Slayer scrolls. Absolutely thumbs up.

620
02:06:56,680 --> 02:07:03,500
Oi, what are you looking at? Thumbs up. Uh, I'm not going to rate it because it wouldn't,

621
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:07,100
it wasn't bad, but it wasn't, it was just kind of a little demo of the environment.

622
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:14,520
Is the Zelda forest book of the dragon working portal gun demo. I'm going to give

623
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:19,000
you a thumbs up just because PlayStation home. I don't, I didn't really, I'm not going to

624
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:23,899
down rate it, but thumbs this up. What did it? Oh, okay. I already have it rated.

625
02:07:24,819 --> 02:07:30,779
The encounter is well done. Art gallery. I don't need to rate it. Gun Blood is the,

626
02:07:32,699 --> 02:07:35,659
the duel. Here's Mario Odyssey. I'm not going to rate it, make me almost puke,

627
02:07:35,659 --> 02:07:41,640
but it was still cool. Uh, ultra realistic FPS prototype. I'm not going to rate it.

628
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:46,119
It wasn't anything really there. It was interesting environment though.

629
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:50,760
Cone ball. Yeah. Polarity was cute, but I don't know if I wanted to give it. I'm

630
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:54,760
going to give rocket league. Uh, I'm going to give 1980s rocket league a thumbs up.

631
02:07:54,760 --> 02:08:00,979
This is the Sonic one. And then this is the currently bugged version of visceral.

632
02:08:00,979 --> 02:08:09,779
All right. I think we're good. Very, very cool. All right. I leveled up.

633
02:08:09,779 --> 02:08:19,670
Innovation, audio, curation, design, play art. What did I do? You are level three.

634
02:08:19,670 --> 02:08:23,989
You're still finding your way in the dream. In verse. So we can't assign you a person

635
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:27,859
yet. We should have a better idea of who you are by level five.

636
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:44,939
Okay. Uh, it's my personality test. So we got, we did auto surf, haunted mansion with kitchen.

637
02:08:44,939 --> 02:08:55,130
All right. Let's just go back and actually do dream shaping. See what we can do.

638
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:09,800
I'm very, very ready. This is dream shaping. Here. You have the power to manifest anything

639
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:19,189
you can imagine. Music, a story, a piece of art, a whole game, even something there is

640
02:09:19,189 --> 02:09:25,960
no word for yet. I'm excited. Create things from scratch using the dream tools. Here

641
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:29,880
comes a 10 hour tutorial to remix something another dreamer has made.

642
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:37,319
Maybe not that long. I'll take you to the dreams workshop where my friend, the dreams

643
02:09:37,319 --> 02:09:42,119
architect will introduce you to the secrets of creation.

644
02:09:44,939 --> 02:09:48,779
How is that not porn on this yet? How, what are you talking about?

645
02:09:48,779 --> 02:09:51,899
Go on in. He won't bite. Promise.

646
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:59,859
It's been up for like four days. Relax. Or what? Like a week? Not even? No, no,

647
02:09:59,859 --> 02:10:07,239
no. Don't relax. Like relax as in it's not going to be here. Okay. Start dreaming

648
02:10:07,239 --> 02:10:15,079
one tutorial to unlock this feature. Wait, what? Okay. We have to do the dreams workshop.

649
02:10:16,659 --> 02:10:26,539
Master classes and techniques. I'm ready. I'm so excited for this.

650
02:10:26,539 --> 02:10:32,939
So you want to learn the ropes of dream shaping, but you don't know where the

651
02:10:32,939 --> 02:10:38,699
tools are on the shelf or how to use that intriguing gadget. Or you want to know what

652
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:46,539
that strange contraption over there does. Architect, assist us. I think it'd be easy.

653
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:56,329
Hello architect. Hello Queenie. Why am I a squirrel? Just a temporary physical form for you.

654
02:10:56,329 --> 02:11:01,689
I like it. It's cute. Well, thank you. It's better than the last one.

655
02:11:02,729 --> 02:11:09,130
Now show this dream shaper how to unleash their creative power. Done. Follow me,

656
02:11:09,130 --> 02:11:13,210
dreamer. Oh, it's so exciting that you're here. I have been really looking forward to

657
02:11:13,289 --> 02:11:19,529
this. There is so much to show you. Gameplay, animation, art. There's no limit to what's

658
02:11:19,529 --> 02:11:26,039
possible. Give me the tools. This is the dreams workshop. We got a lot of

659
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:39,819
so guys, we all I think can be comfortable knowing that this is going to look probably

660
02:11:39,819 --> 02:11:44,550
and do this for a while. Start dreaming, gain the power to make your own dreams come true

661
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:56,250
by first getting to know the basics. Two months of streams. Oh Jesus. Are you new

662
02:11:56,250 --> 02:12:00,409
to dream shaping? The start dreaming tutorials are your entry point to creating. Here you'll

663
02:12:00,409 --> 02:12:03,930
get to know the basics of edit mode, navigating scenes and the assembly tools.

664
02:12:03,930 --> 02:12:16,920
There are eight steps. Part one, step one of probably 50 to 100 parts. You're just

665
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:23,300
doing a labo. Going blind? You guys can't do that. And I physically can't do that

666
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:28,899
because I have to complete this first. No, I'm going to do this. I've been waiting

667
02:12:28,899 --> 02:12:34,380
a long time for this game. I've been waiting a decade for this game to come out. I've

668
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:39,270
been waiting longer for dreams than I probably have for the winds of winter. It's a long

669
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:49,619
time. So I'm going to start. Find quantities first. What's going on?

670
02:12:49,779 --> 02:12:57,109
I've got some spectacular tricks to show you and some that are just all right. Make

671
02:12:57,109 --> 02:13:01,109
sure you follow the steps carefully if you want to get the most out of this. I need

672
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:06,869
to start drinking. No, it's not just about getting to the end. It's the journey that

673
02:13:06,869 --> 02:13:13,189
counts. I'm going to start drinking. You'll be in edit mode, creating and editing your

674
02:13:13,829 --> 02:13:26,020
own scenes. First, I'm going to show you how to move around a scene. This is the scene.

675
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:30,340
I don't get it. I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. You can see that we're in edit

676
02:13:30,340 --> 02:13:36,020
mode because the assembly mode icon is in the top left of the screen. If you ever

677
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:41,220
need to remind yourself of the controls, select that icon with the X button. So we're

678
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:47,029
in assembly mode. And select it again to hide the controls. You can also see

679
02:13:47,029 --> 02:13:51,510
the assembly menu at the top of the screen. That's where you'll find all the

680
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:57,319
tools and modes you need to construct your scenes. The assembly menu is opened

681
02:13:57,319 --> 02:14:02,680
and closed by pressing the square button. You won't need it just yet, so go

682
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:08,520
ahead and close it with square. Okay. First, I'm going to show you how to

683
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:13,659
move around in edit mode, as it's a bit different from play mode. To give

684
02:14:13,739 --> 02:14:18,619
you something to do, I've hidden a puppet somewhere in the scene, which we'll need

685
02:14:18,619 --> 02:14:24,060
in later tutorials. I've left some clues to help you find it. It's probably

686
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:28,300
behind this. Before we search for the first clue, let's start by looking

687
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:33,539
around. Left stick. In front of you, you can see a floating island with some

688
02:14:33,539 --> 02:14:38,500
shapes on it. I can. If you move the right stick to the left and right,

689
02:14:38,500 --> 02:14:44,100
you can look around the scene. Is there an orange cone around here?

690
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:51,060
Um, um, you found it. No, I didn't. There's a blue cube around here

691
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:55,220
somewhere too. What? See if you can find it. Oh, they're talking about in the

692
02:14:55,220 --> 02:15:01,220
outer space. Now try looking up with the right stick to find the pink

693
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:10,069
pyramid. That's the one. Okay, let's turn back towards the shapes

694
02:15:10,069 --> 02:15:15,430
floating on the island. My first clue is hidden somewhere on this island.

695
02:15:15,510 --> 02:15:24,390
My first clue. Yeah, I looked at it already. This is your clue.

696
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:43,859
I already knew that. There's the clue. It's right here. Circle it.

697
02:15:46,979 --> 02:15:59,699
We're almost done.

698
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:18,840
Okay. That's what I'm gonna do.

699
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Maximize it to watch in instructions view. Maximize the video? In instructions view,

700
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,140
you can see more information about the steps.

701
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:33,459
Once the current step is finished, press the arrow button to move on to

702
02:16:33,459 --> 02:16:39,670
the next one. Three fifty two. Done. Second to do.

703
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:45,510
Did you find that clue? It was on the back of one of those shapes.

704
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:49,510
Looks a bit like a rocket. So this really, yeah, this really does

705
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:54,950
treat you like you're four.

706
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:59,829
Alright, anything related to rockets.

707
02:16:59,829 --> 02:17:03,909
Okay, island in the distance. Those shapes look a lot like the ones in the

708
02:17:03,909 --> 02:17:07,989
clue. They do.

709
02:17:08,629 --> 02:17:13,139
Remember, push up on the left stick to move forward

710
02:17:13,139 --> 02:17:17,299
and use the right stick to change direction. And don't forget,

711
02:17:17,299 --> 02:17:20,659
you can recalibrate your imp by holding the options button.

712
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:26,950
Yes, and make sure you do a loop. Two loops wrap around and pull

713
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:30,549
to keep your shoes on. Alright, what do I do now?

714
02:17:30,549 --> 02:17:34,870
Make sure you're looking right at the cylinder and the cone.

715
02:17:34,870 --> 02:17:38,709
When you're ready, move on to the next step. Oh fuck, that was all I had to do?

716
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:42,979
Well these steps are really easy though, so we're going to blow through this.

717
02:17:42,979 --> 02:17:49,829
Think back to the first clue. The cone was on top of the cylinder, right?

718
02:17:49,829 --> 02:17:54,010
How can you move them? Well in edit mode, you interact with

719
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:57,530
everything using your imp. The very tip of your imp's pointing mark.

720
02:17:57,530 --> 02:18:01,209
He's going to show us how to make a porn game.

721
02:18:01,209 --> 02:18:06,840
I don't believe that will. That shows you what tool the imp is using.

722
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:10,760
Right now, it's the arrow's icon, which means the imp is using the

723
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:15,129
move tool. That's the default tool in edit mode,

724
02:18:15,129 --> 02:18:19,719
because editing a scene means moving things around a lot.

725
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:24,040
Let's see the imp in action. First, grab the cone,

726
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:29,270
hover over it with your imp, and hold R2.

727
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:33,670
Now your imp has the cone. Use the controller's motion sensor function to

728
02:18:33,670 --> 02:18:37,659
move it around. Try to put it on top of the

729
02:18:37,659 --> 02:18:43,420
cylinder, just like in the clue. Use the left stick to move the cone

730
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:49,670
backwards and forwards. Objects in scenes can intersect and

731
02:18:49,670 --> 02:18:54,149
overlap, so it doesn't have to be perfect.

732
02:18:54,149 --> 02:18:59,510
Get it roughly into place, and I'll show you how to refine it later.

733
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:07,690
Once for done, you're ready for the next step.

734
02:19:07,690 --> 02:19:12,010
Now that looks pretty good, at least from this angle.

735
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:15,690
The 18 scenes in three-dimensional space

736
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:19,209
means that you should always look at your creations from different angles.

737
02:19:19,209 --> 02:19:22,809
That's such a shitty job. No, it's not. The easiest way to do that

738
02:19:22,809 --> 02:19:26,010
is with the grab cam. See, I didn't even know about that.

739
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:30,729
Instead of moving the objects you grab, grab cam moves your point of view

740
02:19:30,729 --> 02:19:37,989
around them. Try it out on the cone. Grab cam. Hover over it, then press

741
02:19:37,989 --> 02:19:43,430
and hold R1. Pushing the left and right

742
02:19:43,430 --> 02:19:46,629
sticks moves your point of view around the cone.

743
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:52,010
Easy. Okay. Now that you can get a proper look at it,

744
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:57,290
check that the cone is on straight, unlike mine.

745
02:19:57,290 --> 02:20:01,100
Let go of R1 to stop using the grab cam,

746
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:06,540
and use R2 to make any adjustments you need.

747
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:12,620
Here's a little secret called nudge. If you don't press R2 all the way down,

748
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:15,819
but just hold it lightly, you can move the cone

749
02:20:15,819 --> 02:20:22,920
slowly, giving you finer control. Perfect. Once you're happy the cone

750
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:26,920
is straight, you can move on to the next step. That's perfect. I'm done.

751
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:35,190
Hey, did you find the clue? Another clue.

752
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:41,659
It's a molecule. I know because I put it there. Just play along with it.

753
02:20:41,659 --> 02:20:44,540
Okay, there's the clue. What do you want me to do with it? Why don't you look

754
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:47,739
around with the right stick and see if you can find another

755
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:53,899
molecule? There's one over there by that island.

756
02:20:53,899 --> 02:20:57,420
You're hot on the trail. I didn't even look and he told me.

757
02:20:57,420 --> 02:21:00,940
It'll take forever to get there using the left stick.

758
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:05,340
Luckily, you can use the grab cam to get there faster.

759
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:11,899
Give it a try now. Hover your imp over that orange cube in the distance.

760
02:21:11,899 --> 02:21:15,819
Hold R1 to grab it with the grab cam.

761
02:21:15,819 --> 02:21:19,500
Then gently push up on the left stick to zoom right over.

762
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:24,979
I get it. Just keep holding R1 until you've made it all the way to

763
02:21:25,059 --> 02:21:30,979
the island. Come on, come on, come on, come on. See, told you it was quicker,

764
02:21:30,979 --> 02:21:35,190
but there's an even faster way to zip around scenes.

765
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:40,250
It's just like the grab cam, but you'll also need to hold L1.

766
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:43,770
You see, L1 is a very special button. Tell me more.

767
02:21:43,770 --> 02:21:47,209
You know the way that on a computer keyboard, holding down shift

768
02:21:47,209 --> 02:21:51,049
changes what some keys do? Well, it's a function key.

769
02:21:51,049 --> 02:21:55,639
Holding down L1 changes what the other buttons do.

770
02:21:55,639 --> 02:22:00,739
Maybe it's best if I show you. You see that rocket you built earlier?

771
02:22:00,739 --> 02:22:06,860
Hover your imp over it. Now hold L1 and then press R1, the grab cam

772
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:09,340
button. You don't have to hold it or use the

773
02:22:09,340 --> 02:22:13,420
stick this time. So you can just fly around.

774
02:22:13,420 --> 02:22:17,659
Just skip the shit out of them. Try it out again on the return journey.

775
02:22:17,659 --> 02:22:23,319
Hover your imp over the orange cube and hold L1.

776
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:34,409
Then press R1 to zoom right on over. No, fuck. I want to go forward 10

777
02:22:34,409 --> 02:22:38,309
seconds. Now, that looks like the initial space is with the grab cam.

778
02:22:38,309 --> 02:22:42,069
Just hold it lightly. You can move the cone slowly,

779
02:22:42,069 --> 02:22:47,659
giving you finer control. Wait, what? Oh, this is the wrong one.

780
02:22:47,659 --> 02:22:54,889
Hey, look at that. Find L1.

781
02:22:54,889 --> 02:22:59,610
Whoa! Hover your imp over it. Now that you know how to move around quickly,

782
02:22:59,610 --> 02:23:04,090
I gotta, okay, find the clue on the island. All right. Yeah.

783
02:23:04,090 --> 02:23:07,770
Remember to use the grab cam to look around the whole island.

784
02:23:07,770 --> 02:23:16,149
Once you've found the clue, you can move on.

785
02:23:16,149 --> 02:23:24,920
Underneath? You want to, is that, I found a trash can.

786
02:23:24,920 --> 02:23:31,139
Did you find the last clue? It was on the back of the orange cube.

787
02:23:31,139 --> 02:23:35,219
What on earth could it mean? Trash can. If I had eyes, I would wink at you

788
02:23:35,219 --> 02:23:39,219
right now. Hmm. I can't see any other green

789
02:23:39,299 --> 02:23:42,340
trash cans in edit mode using the triangle button.

790
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:45,700
Got it. Just hover your imp over the cube,

791
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:54,229
then press triangle, and it's gone. These tools are powerful. Delete the

792
02:23:54,229 --> 02:23:59,690
orange sphere next. If you change your mind or delete the

793
02:23:59,690 --> 02:24:03,049
wrong thing, you can press undo, which is the left

794
02:24:03,049 --> 02:24:07,159
directional button. How many undoes can you get?

795
02:24:07,159 --> 02:24:11,510
Just press the right directional button.

796
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:14,629
You can undo and redo pretty much anything,

797
02:24:14,629 --> 02:24:19,780
not just deletions. Oh look, there was a clue

798
02:24:19,780 --> 02:24:23,540
hidden in the cube. It means to go up. An arrow.

799
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:28,489
Nice. Hmm. Perhaps there's another one like it nearby.

800
02:24:28,489 --> 02:24:31,850
Look around with the right stick and see if you can spot it.

801
02:24:31,850 --> 02:24:37,370
Found it. Once you've found it, you can move on to the next step.

802
02:24:37,370 --> 02:24:46,280
Excellent. We're almost done. That was my final clue telling you where to go.

803
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:51,909
The island right above us. I know you're an expert in moving around with the

804
02:24:51,909 --> 02:24:56,069
left and right stick. You're an expert in moving with the

805
02:24:56,069 --> 02:25:00,420
left stick. Remember that holding L1 changes what

806
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:04,649
the grab cam does. It can also change what the left

807
02:25:04,649 --> 02:25:08,520
stick does. Sure. Normally it moves you backwards

808
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:11,479
and forwards in the direction you're facing,

809
02:25:11,479 --> 02:25:15,559
but if you hold L1 at the same time, the left stick will make you move

810
02:25:15,639 --> 02:25:22,600
up and down instead. That's good. Cool. Get up to the last island.

811
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:25,719
I'm on the last island. Position yourself so you're looking at the orange arrow

812
02:25:25,719 --> 02:25:32,010
which is pointing up. Oh. Now hold L1.

813
02:25:32,010 --> 02:25:35,049
When you're ready, move on to the next step.

814
02:25:35,049 --> 02:25:42,649
I will. Right. Here's the puppet I reserved for you.

815
02:25:42,649 --> 02:25:48,489
Almost done. Let's call her Connie because she looks like a cone.

816
02:25:48,489 --> 02:25:52,170
We need to help Connie walk through the door to complete this tutorial.

817
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:56,729
R2. To do that, we're gonna have to switch over to play mode.

818
02:25:56,729 --> 02:25:59,450
Finally we get some new info. Finally some new intel.

819
02:25:59,450 --> 02:26:05,159
You're in edit mode. This is where you create and edit your scenes.

820
02:26:05,159 --> 02:26:10,120
In play mode, you can experience the scene just like a player would if they found it in the

821
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:14,280
dreamiverse. You can't make any changes in

822
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:17,479
play mode, but you can take control of characters

823
02:26:17,559 --> 02:26:22,739
and try out what you've made. Switch over to play mode now.

824
02:26:22,739 --> 02:26:26,899
Just press the options button on your controller.

825
02:26:26,899 --> 02:26:31,139
Play mode. Hover over the controller icon with your imp.

826
02:26:31,139 --> 02:26:35,850
Then press X to select it. I just did that.

827
02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:40,569
To control a puppet in a scene, you first need to possess it with R2.

828
02:26:40,569 --> 02:26:46,069
Now I get to play the game with whatever characters are here.

829
02:26:46,069 --> 02:26:49,670
She's full of beans, isn't she? I gotta play something. I picked her just

830
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:53,190
for you. Walk her around a bit, then take her

831
02:26:53,190 --> 02:26:57,030
through the door to finish this tutorial. There's no stairs there.

832
02:26:57,030 --> 02:27:03,430
Oh, looks like the door's too high. Died in tutorial. Died in tutorial.

833
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:06,629
She might be able to reach it if you make her jump

834
02:27:06,629 --> 02:27:13,129
by pressing X. Wait, I just did that. Oops, I remember now. I'm like 20

835
02:27:13,129 --> 02:27:20,139
seconds ahead of them. Better head back into edit mode.

836
02:27:20,139 --> 02:27:23,899
To switch back to edit mode, just press options again.

837
02:27:23,899 --> 02:27:27,739
Then select the pencil icon. Tools. Modes.

838
02:27:27,739 --> 02:27:31,899
Animate. Gadgets. Did you see those stairs on the island below us?

839
02:27:31,899 --> 02:27:35,819
Those might come in handy now. Straight down to them with L1

840
02:27:35,819 --> 02:27:41,780
and the left stick. If you've deleted the stairs,

841
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:47,129
you can use undo by pressing the left directional button.

842
02:27:47,129 --> 02:27:52,409
Just keep pressing it until the stairs come back.

843
02:27:52,489 --> 02:28:00,139
Okay, press and hold R2 to grab them. Now, without letting go, hold L1 and use

844
02:28:00,139 --> 02:28:02,700
the left stick to strafe back up to Connie.

845
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:08,299
I'm already ahead of you. Place the stairs in front of the door

846
02:28:08,299 --> 02:28:13,700
and let go of R2. There, that should do it.

847
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:17,850
That's, it's a little shitty, but it doesn't matter. Back to play mode now.

848
02:28:17,850 --> 02:28:22,010
Remember, press options, then select the controller icon

849
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:26,809
with X. Tutorial one done. You'll be switching back and forth between

850
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:36,040
saving tutorial progress. Thank god. Don't have to do it again.

851
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:39,319
Start dreaming part one of four. Well done. You completed this tutorial. You'll be

852
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:41,719
able to return and replay any of the steps.

853
02:28:41,719 --> 02:28:52,950
Only a few more of these. Use reward. Continue tutorials. Imp quest complete.

854
02:28:52,950 --> 02:29:08,100
Use, what is this? Use reward? What do I get for this?

855
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:11,139
Home space editor? Is that what this is?

856
02:29:11,139 --> 02:29:16,100
Ah, the home space editor. A great place to start your creative journey.

857
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:19,459
We're still working on this right now. In time,

858
02:29:19,459 --> 02:29:22,420
you'll be able to put things you've made. So this is not done. So it feels

859
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:31,290
like your own. All right, so not done.

860
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:35,129
Look at all the wonderful things you found.

861
02:29:35,129 --> 02:29:38,649
There's lots more where these came from. Prizes. And look at the things

862
02:29:38,649 --> 02:29:45,350
the folks at Media Molecule left for you in MM style. MM

863
02:29:45,350 --> 02:29:48,950
characters. Collection of characters created by the MM team.

864
02:29:48,950 --> 02:29:58,180
Contraptions. Sculptures. Okay, what's this thing?

865
02:29:58,180 --> 02:30:04,149
Fancy. Where's nice for it to go? Definitely so I can get, I want to

866
02:30:04,149 --> 02:30:06,709
unlock this. I want to get this thing and put it over

867
02:30:06,709 --> 02:30:18,520
here. Like down here, right? So I can jump.

868
02:30:18,520 --> 02:30:22,020
Oh shit, I just placed two. All right, that's good.

869
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:35,020
Oh whoops. It's okay, I can fix it. All right, I can get that thing now. Let

870
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:50,780
me get this thing. Okay, give me over here. These have

871
02:30:50,780 --> 02:31:02,420
collision, right? I've got another toy. I might as well get

872
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:16,729
this too while I'm still here. Whoops. Wait, can I just pick you up?

873
02:31:16,729 --> 02:31:36,069
No. I'm gonna do the stairs. I might as well just do the stairs.

874
02:31:36,069 --> 02:31:41,159
I can't jump. Can I not jump up the stairs? That was weird.

875
02:31:41,159 --> 02:31:51,430
All right, back to tutorial. Dream shaping.

876
02:31:51,430 --> 02:32:02,870
Level four. What do you get for leveling up? He's still finding a way. We

877
02:32:02,870 --> 02:32:07,190
can't assign you persona. Level five. Now to explore the wider

878
02:32:07,190 --> 02:32:14,389
world of dream shaping. All right, I can browse and create. I

879
02:32:14,389 --> 02:32:19,540
feel like I need to know the other things.

880
02:32:19,540 --> 02:32:31,399
Let's just see what happens. Go in raw. In a moment,

881
02:32:31,399 --> 02:32:34,200
you'll be creating and editing your own scenes.

882
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:38,760
Recreate PT. Scenes are like levels in a game

883
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:41,959
or scenes in a movie. They're made up of

884
02:32:41,959 --> 02:32:48,120
elements. Elements are like props, sets, music, effects, and characters.

885
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:51,399
Hey, this is gonna be bizarre, can't we? Anything that you can build inside a

886
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:56,659
scene and save the dream of us. Scenes are connected together to form

887
02:32:56,659 --> 02:33:01,059
dreams. And these dreams can be found when

888
02:33:01,059 --> 02:33:06,729
you go dream surfing. Recreate the tutorial. That would be

889
02:33:06,729 --> 02:33:12,780
pretty hard. Scenes are like scenes. All right,

890
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:16,780
collection. Store, game scene, single player, co-op, puzzle, interactive

891
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:21,190
experiences. Features, shorts, visual novels, sit back

892
02:33:21,190 --> 02:33:26,389
and enjoy. Galleries, playlists, expos,

893
02:33:26,389 --> 02:33:32,389
characters, sculpture, contraption, music,

894
02:33:32,389 --> 02:33:44,219
sound effect, instrument, vehicle, animation, effect, dreams. Oh my god.

895
02:33:44,219 --> 02:34:03,610
I'm gonna pick instrument, I think. Soft piano, create.

896
02:34:03,610 --> 02:34:15,989
How do I- dreamers. Make a dating sim. Well, hold on, if I first-

897
02:34:15,989 --> 02:34:35,850
Sub sound? No. Strings. Very string playing techniques too from

898
02:34:35,850 --> 02:35:33,100
legato to coal. I'm viewing the music? Where is it? Is it up there?

899
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:50,629
Whoa, um, what? So you can do C, A, F, volume? Spice?

900
02:35:50,629 --> 02:37:09,850
Bend? This is why we need the tutorials. Holy shit. Okay, that's it. How does

901
02:37:09,850 --> 02:37:35,370
that sound? How do I play it? Rewind and pause and

902
02:37:35,370 --> 02:37:39,930
record. The perform tool. You're in sound mode.

903
02:37:39,930 --> 02:37:49,059
I need perform tool. Play mode? Because I can't select that.

904
02:37:49,059 --> 02:37:54,420
Perform tool? You know, if only there was some way to

905
02:37:54,420 --> 02:38:04,739
learn all this. Yeah, I know. I'm getting out of here. I can't even

906
02:38:04,739 --> 02:38:23,770
leave. Effect field? All this stuff. You can spend a thousand hours in this

907
02:38:23,770 --> 02:38:27,739
game and still be figuring out how to do it.

908
02:38:27,739 --> 02:38:43,700
Vehicle? Sound effects? Hold on. Underground catacombs? Air horn?

909
02:38:43,700 --> 02:39:00,899
Really? So you can just- so you can upload sounds then?

910
02:39:00,979 --> 02:39:05,719
Sports ball? Okay. You can make your own music.

911
02:39:05,719 --> 02:39:13,180
Contraptions? Sculpture? Character? Game scene? All right. I'm going- I'm doing

912
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:15,420
the tutorials. I'm just gonna do them. You know

913
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:19,479
what I mean? You have to. You cannot go into a game like this

914
02:39:19,479 --> 02:39:32,329
blind. It's not- it's just not possible. So here we go. Two out of four. Making

915
02:39:32,329 --> 02:39:39,829
things bigger and smaller. See you in 20 hours. It has to be

916
02:39:39,829 --> 02:39:45,510
done. I can't just not do this.

917
02:39:45,590 --> 02:39:48,870
Because Connie's friend Cuthbert fell asleep in the Dreamiverse

918
02:39:48,870 --> 02:39:53,750
and got stranded. Yes, he's a cube with legs.

919
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:57,750
Connie didn't choose her friends. I did.

920
02:39:57,750 --> 02:40:02,149
So we need to fix these platforms if she's gonna reach the flag

921
02:40:02,149 --> 02:40:07,930
and get to Cuthbert. Before we start, you can switch to play mode to see how

922
02:40:07,930 --> 02:40:12,600
a player would experience this scene. Yeah, it's already all screwed up.

923
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:16,920
You'll always need to test things out in play mode. I can't- I can't jump to

924
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:21,479
this. Bad design.

925
02:40:21,479 --> 02:40:27,079
Then select play mode with X. Its icon looks like a controller.

926
02:40:27,079 --> 02:40:34,920
I know. Once you're in play mode. Oh dear. Looks like it's too far for

927
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:39,319
Connie. Move that first platform closer. Yep.

928
02:40:39,319 --> 02:40:43,879
To do that, head back into edit mode.

929
02:40:43,959 --> 02:40:47,719
Pull this over here. Open the options menu and select the button with the

930
02:40:47,719 --> 02:40:51,959
pencil icon. Move this back. That looks good. Once

931
02:40:51,959 --> 02:40:55,639
you're in edit mode, move on to the next step. I can go

932
02:40:55,639 --> 02:41:02,579
like this. Rotate. Sit you back here. Is that good?

933
02:41:02,579 --> 02:41:09,110
Looks all right. Sort of. Yeah, that's fine.

934
02:41:09,110 --> 02:41:12,549
And then this one has to be grown. Look, I'm gonna see if I can figure

935
02:41:12,549 --> 02:41:16,870
it out on my own, right? And then, so for instance,

936
02:41:16,870 --> 02:41:35,159
resize. Makes sense. That. Okay. It's a little- it's a little

937
02:41:35,159 --> 02:41:39,079
tilted, but that's fine. All right. Now let's play this. I'm

938
02:41:39,079 --> 02:41:40,600
gonna play the video. We're gonna do it fast.

939
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:47,700
Ready? We have to do something about these platforms.

940
02:41:47,700 --> 02:41:51,139
Move your view side onto Connie and the first pink platform

941
02:41:51,139 --> 02:41:56,870
strafe up and down. The imp has this equipped by default.

942
02:41:56,870 --> 02:42:03,639
Move tool. Move it where you- I moved it. Over so it lines up with the pink. Yep. R2.

943
02:42:03,639 --> 02:42:07,319
Use the left stick to move the platform back. Yeah. By pressing the

944
02:42:07,559 --> 02:42:12,920
directional button. Okay. That's because their auto guide gadget.

945
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:19,239
Wait, wait, wait. Auto guide gadget. What is that?

946
02:42:19,239 --> 02:42:22,920
You may have noticed that objects move more freely here in edit mode than in

947
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:26,040
the home space. That's because their auto guide

948
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:29,159
gadgets are disabled by default in the guides menu.

949
02:42:29,159 --> 02:42:33,399
Okay, well fine. I'll explain more about this in another tutorial. But for

950
02:42:33,399 --> 02:42:35,959
now, you don't need to worry about it.

951
02:42:35,959 --> 02:42:39,479
It just means you have more freedom to dream shape.

952
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:47,799
when the platform is in the right spot you're ready for the next step okay and that next step is to

953
02:42:47,799 --> 02:42:58,709
play it now that the first platform's in position let's all right hold on hold on guys i'm gonna

954
02:42:58,709 --> 02:43:04,090
level with you here because i have to do these it's probably gonna take at least three it's

955
02:43:04,090 --> 02:43:08,250
probably gonna take at least two or three hours to do these tutorials right so here's the plan

956
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:13,610
okay here's what's gonna happen i am going to i'm going to do the tutorial off stream

957
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:27,739
because this is probably going to be a solid like two plus maybe three hours to do this all

958
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:38,219
so here's the here's the deal i'm gonna go p i'm gonna play this tomorrow we're gonna make

959
02:43:38,219 --> 02:43:43,559
something tomorrow when i turn the stream off tonight i'm gonna do all these i'm gonna spend

960
02:43:43,559 --> 02:43:47,559
like four whatever three four five plus hours doing it and then we're gonna make something

961
02:43:47,559 --> 02:43:56,920
and i'm gonna have all the knowledge i'm going to be prepared completely so tomorrow we will

962
02:43:57,559 --> 02:44:03,000
play the creation portion of dreams for the remainder of today because it's been about

963
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:23,559
three hours we can either go back and do some more dreams change over to sam and max finish

964
02:44:23,559 --> 02:44:34,120
that third episode but you will see a i'm going to be making stuff tomorrow okay i'll

965
02:44:34,120 --> 02:44:41,139
give you a poll because i can definitely foresee that this is going to take a large chunk of

966
02:44:41,139 --> 02:44:49,059
time and i know people don't really want to watch tutorials maybe you do but i'd rather just come

967
02:44:49,059 --> 02:44:54,180
and have a bunch of stuff to have for you tomorrow you know what i mean we'll see and may

968
02:44:54,180 --> 02:45:10,459
i could be wrong here so let's find out i'm gonna put a poll in the chat i'll give you

969
02:45:10,459 --> 02:45:30,500
some good options okay here we go i am extraordinarily excited for this game but i want to

970
02:45:30,500 --> 02:45:37,530
know what i'm doing there you go i am gonna just go p i'm gonna take my first break

971
02:45:38,250 --> 02:50:29,770
we'll see what you guys want to do i will be right back stay tuned all right hey how are we

972
02:50:29,770 --> 02:50:46,709
doing uh we are a bit too close to call right here 400 to within one percent

973
02:51:05,610 --> 02:51:12,549
goddamn tutorial voters three all right this is this i might have to just remove the tutorials

974
02:51:12,549 --> 02:51:28,069
one then but it's just the top two because if that this is within that this is within six

975
02:51:28,069 --> 02:51:37,559
this is within six votes maybe you'd be inclined to vote for sam and max or surfing if you didn't

976
02:51:37,559 --> 02:51:45,979
want me to do these tutorials i don't know all right let's eliminate the tutorials then

977
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:56,579
you guys you guys are always happy you guys always do this it's too close

978
02:51:58,649 --> 02:52:13,110
it's four like look at this 427 428 430 to 430 do you see how close this is every time

979
02:52:13,110 --> 02:52:19,030
look at this the division here all right new poll we're getting rid of tutorials

980
02:52:24,250 --> 02:52:33,559
and this is it i'm gonna call this i'm gonna call this dream surfing or salmon max you know

981
02:52:33,559 --> 02:52:57,129
what they are the title is required oh shit there you go this one's not gonna be as long

982
02:52:57,129 --> 02:53:07,159
this one's gonna be like less than two minutes germa lied about minecraft vr thanks for the

983
02:53:07,159 --> 02:53:22,760
five community subs thank you because right now if i go back i'm looking at the first poll

984
02:53:28,569 --> 02:53:44,040
the first poll has 42 to 41 percent not the tie i'm gonna i'm gonna finish sam and max episode

985
02:53:44,040 --> 02:53:58,090
three so don't worry i'm gonna do the whole season another five community subs for germa

986
02:53:58,090 --> 02:54:02,489
lied about ace attorney i don't these are a bunch of things that i haven't lied about

987
02:54:02,489 --> 02:54:11,190
why don't i just make sam and max in dreams all right i'm closing this in 10 seconds

988
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:19,579
it looks like by a very small amount we are going to stay in dreams we're going to dream

989
02:54:19,579 --> 02:54:29,159
surf for a little while longer going back to the first poll dream surfing did win this poll here

990
02:54:29,159 --> 02:54:35,479
it is currently sitting at 460 to 449 in favor of do more surfing so it looks like on both

991
02:54:35,479 --> 02:54:58,180
poles dream surfing has won even with the removal of the tutorials all right so we're

992
02:54:58,180 --> 02:55:16,280
gonna go dream surfing but i'm supposed to be almost by the same amount too it won both

993
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:25,700
poles by yeah all right let's back it up and those of you that really want to see sam and

994
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:34,790
max do not worry sam and max is going to it'll probably be the day after tomorrow i will probably

995
02:55:34,790 --> 02:55:43,739
do sam and max on wednesday it's just what you wanted to see right this second so let's do some

996
02:55:43,739 --> 02:55:59,739
more surfing people that wanted the tutorial also wanted dreams that's true but that dream

997
02:55:59,739 --> 02:56:07,739
surfing did technically win that first poll so it didn't really matter all right i'm gonna

998
02:56:07,739 --> 02:56:22,389
get out of here let's go back and let's dream surf this time i'm gonna actually look at some

999
02:56:22,389 --> 02:56:34,950
of these because they're instead of doing the auto one battle tops haunted mansion so this is

1000
02:56:34,950 --> 02:56:42,440
an entire story with the thing in the top right mean how many scenes it has and what does that

1001
02:56:42,440 --> 02:57:03,719

1070
03:12:33,510 --> 03:12:38,309
with such data internet internet is awful across the entire country of the united states the

1071
03:12:38,309 --> 03:12:44,090
united states has just shitty it doesn't matter where you go everybody complains about it

1072
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:51,530
internet's terrible everywhere there's like four internet companies in america all of them suck

1073
03:12:52,090 --> 03:12:59,979
they're all terrible there's cox spectrum comcast and like century link there's like four

1074
03:12:59,979 --> 03:13:06,899
companies in the whole entire country pick which one they're all awful it doesn't matter where

1075
03:13:06,899 --> 03:13:15,379
you go this and there's like google fiber in like four places or verizon verizon files in

1076
03:13:15,379 --> 03:13:30,760
like three places but that's the thing about internet right here so let's let's do the

1077
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:35,020
internet rant here i sometimes you see people that say what are you talking about my internet's

1078
03:13:35,020 --> 03:13:40,379
fine i mean you but you're probably not noticing it right so what you get to see when you watch

1079
03:13:40,379 --> 03:13:48,700
like a stream is a live feed of how bad their internet is it's just a consistent online feed

1080
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:54,579
of that person's internet there's no way to tell how bad or slow your internet could be

1081
03:13:54,579 --> 03:14:00,340
running sometimes because i mean my internet's still on i could go to a website right now

1082
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:09,379
just fine but the way that it goes through the cables and to the plant and out to the nodes

1083
03:14:09,940 --> 03:14:28,809
and i think i think i'm off i think i think it turned off so it's it's not how do i jump

1084
03:14:32,680 --> 03:14:44,540
what's okay l1 is jump i'm going as fast as i can possibly go i can only go 10 i can't go

1085
03:14:44,540 --> 03:15:18,260
higher than 10 does this end i did it eight penalties that's not bad like speed does not

1086
03:15:18,260 --> 03:15:23,379
mean stability and that's the problem american internet it's actually you know fairly fast

1087
03:15:24,260 --> 03:15:31,209
but it's not stable really anywhere you go some people luck out some people get really

1088
03:15:31,209 --> 03:15:40,729
really really stable internet most people have at some point issues with stability

1089
03:15:40,729 --> 03:16:02,360

04:38:38,599 --> 04:38:44,119
i start out fine and everything's just dandy and i'm having a good time and i will i will go

1432
04:38:44,119 --> 04:38:54,069
over i will get like 12 strokes on one hole and want to leave i will bowl and i will

1433
04:38:54,069 --> 04:38:56,869
gutter ball twice or something or three times in a row and i'll just be like i don't even

1434
04:38:56,869 --> 04:39:08,459
fucking want to be here i hate this something about it i don't know what it is mini golf and

1435
04:39:08,459 --> 04:39:13,099
bowling both really pissed me off i think you know with bowling i think it's like the real time

1436
04:39:13,099 --> 04:39:19,240
score that's up on the screen so people will know how bad you are i used to like it back

1437
04:39:19,240 --> 04:39:24,840
in the day they had the thing on the table it wasn't up on a big screen people can walk

1438
04:39:24,840 --> 04:39:30,200
by and look at your screen and see oh like the funny name you put up like hot dog right

1439
04:39:32,040 --> 04:39:41,830
has like 34 points it's embarrassing by the way the only reason why i said the word hot dog

1440
04:39:42,389 --> 04:39:49,349
is because we were just a hot dog on the screen what do you mean no one looks at that i do

1441
04:39:50,069 --> 04:39:57,180
when i walk by i and i always hate when they put you next to the fucking good bowlers

1442
04:39:57,900 --> 04:40:05,990
i walk around i i request a lane i walk up and down i look okay there's two here

1443
04:40:06,790 --> 04:40:10,950
there's one in between two other uh parties bowling and you look at their screen they're

1444
04:40:10,950 --> 04:40:17,509
at like 180 200 average i don't want to be next to that person it'll be that would embarrass me

1445
04:40:18,409 --> 04:40:22,520
i will gutter ball three times in a row and watch them hit strikes and it's just like move

1446
04:40:22,520 --> 04:40:37,930
me i don't want to be there 200 isn't good what what are you what planet are you talking

1447
04:40:37,930 --> 04:40:48,540
about 200 is great imagine being insecure about bowling no it's just bowling in mini golf

1448
04:40:48,540 --> 04:40:51,979
because mini golf the same thing happens somebody two people will go in front of you

1449
04:40:52,860 --> 04:40:59,020
and they're they'll get like a birdie it's like a birdie sick man oh nice man my turn oh cool my

1450
04:40:59,020 --> 04:41:06,729
turn everyone watch me now i i thought i missed it's okay i can i get it in i can get it enough

1451
04:41:07,619 --> 04:41:13,939
now i went over a lot in way too much like it was terrible hold on i can still get parts okay

1452
04:41:14,819 --> 04:41:18,680
everyone's sitting there with their arms crossed waiting for you to finish you knock

1453
04:41:18,680 --> 04:41:23,560
it back you miss again and once you get to four or five strokes you start to do the thing where

1454
04:41:23,560 --> 04:41:28,119
you drag the fucking ball around and just drag it into the hole angry just because people want

1455
04:41:28,119 --> 04:41:48,740
to play speaking of which why am i still here that was fun if you don't like people seeing

1456
04:41:48,740 --> 04:41:58,779
how bad you are then why are you a streamer what do you mean i'm not i'm not bad did you beat

1458
04:42:07,380 --> 04:42:11,459

1461
04:42:24,619 --> 04:42:48,650
what does that mean look at how cute this is what i have to do secure is not even that

1462
04:42:48,650 --> 04:42:54,500
hard i mean yo look you you can say that if you want but secure started like a massive

1463
04:42:54,500 --> 04:43:17,930
debate about how hard video games are somebody tuned the piano for the love of god somebody

1464

1469
04:44:07,029 --> 04:44:11,669

1470
04:44:12,310 --> 04:44:18,150
and it would be like like it's getting so taught it's gonna snap and it's gonna hurt them

1471
04:44:18,150 --> 04:44:34,540
i had to get up and leave speaking of leaving i would see them just sitting on the couch and

1472
04:44:34,540 --> 04:44:45,509
it'd be like and that's when i get up and like i think it's gonna break it's gonna hurt them

1473
04:44:45,509 --> 04:44:54,549
same thing with the piano it's just really tight strings tight wait didn't we already do

1477
04:45:29,080 --> 04:45:41,220

1483
04:46:22,310 --> 04:46:34,279
this is the story of bald wizard his only goal in life to grow some hair he has tried

1484
04:46:34,279 --> 04:46:43,580
everything he can done vast amounts of research read many books but he could not find a way

1485
04:46:43,580 --> 04:46:53,849
to get his hair to grow that is until he found out about the gem of hair a magical stone said

1486
04:46:53,849 --> 04:47:02,250
to grow hair anywhere one desires the only problem is the bald wizard has no idea where

1487
04:47:02,250 --> 04:47:11,479
it is located he makes his way to a village he's never been to before he decides the best

1488
04:47:11,479 --> 04:47:18,119
place to find answers would be in a tavern so he makes his way towards the tavern

1489
04:47:19,159 --> 04:47:27,159
as he gets ready to begin his journey in search of the magical stone that will help him achieve

1490
04:47:27,159 --> 04:47:37,689
the one goal he has in life to grow some hair this is the beginning of a long journey

1491
04:47:38,169 --> 04:47:54,380
so okay we're in the bald wizard things don't scare me like haunted houses scary things don't

1492
04:47:54,380 --> 04:48:04,009
scare me a clown could be in a dark room my lights in my bedroom could be off and

1493
04:48:04,009 --> 04:48:09,819
there could be a clown in there with a huge long face blood coming out of his eyes and

1494
04:48:09,819 --> 04:48:13,180
two knives in his hands and he walks up and goes right in my face while i'm dead asleep and

1495
04:48:13,180 --> 04:48:24,869
goes like and i would go whoa hey what the fuck man whoa get out of here dude what the

1496
04:48:24,869 --> 04:48:42,459

1503
04:49:43,430 --> 04:50:05,720

1504
04:50:05,720 --> 04:50:09,639

1506
04:50:19,319 --> 04:50:24,180
putting his mouth and tying it with his teeth and like i hate that sound i don't like it

1507
04:50:24,819 --> 04:50:38,220
and it always it's right before it's about to explode it has nothing to do with the damage

1508
04:50:38,220 --> 04:50:54,389
inflicted how am i supposed to do about this because okay if a balloon pops in your face

1509
04:50:54,389 --> 04:51:03,900
it's just going to be weird bring that over here it's not going to really hurt you i don't

1510
04:51:03,900 --> 04:51:09,590
know why i have this weird image of a balloon popping near somebody's face

1511
04:51:10,790 --> 04:51:15,750
and it like daffy duck cartoon fucking exploding cigars in their face i don't know why i think

1512
04:51:15,750 --> 04:51:23,220
of that i just do can i make this jump i don't think i can do i have to drag that all the

1513
04:51:23,220 --> 04:51:41,259
way across why why is this not moving can't bring it over here because i definitely don't

1514
04:51:41,419 --> 04:52:03,900
make this no well there you go i'm like a snake if i was an animal i would be a snake

1515
04:52:04,700 --> 04:52:09,740
i would well well i thought you're gonna be a rat no i'd be a snake because snakes aren't

1516
04:52:09,740 --> 04:52:15,799
afraid of anything except if you make a loud noise really quickly or if you tune a guitar

1578
05:09:09,340 --> 05:09:16,950

1612
05:20:46,740 --> 05:20:59,909
the camera's in the same spot something's following me that's that's the something is

1613
05:20:59,909 --> 05:21:06,380
waiting and looking and trying to find out well no never mind this is called chinese

05:21:30,139 --> 05:21:58,009
this is this is beautiful fireworks go off that's cool treasure hunt collect all this

1616
05:21:58,009 --> 05:22:08,630
is probably a pretty oh i thought that was ice what i was gonna say is this is probably a template

1617
05:22:09,849 --> 05:22:16,330
that a lot of people do for their first game maybe it's just easy to do the run around and

1618
05:22:16,330 --> 05:22:31,049
collect stuff how do i get unlock more coins yeah i'm gonna put time into this i'm gonna

1619
05:22:31,049 --> 05:22:42,599
give it at least one real shot we're gonna have a giant viewing experience those of you that also

1620
05:22:42,599 --> 05:22:48,630
have dreams and you want to make something and maybe we'll play it tomorrow because tomorrow

1621
05:22:48,630 --> 05:22:53,500
is the creation day this was just stick around and see people have made maybe we'll make a

1622
05:22:53,500 --> 05:22:59,979
certain tag that you can put on the your creation right like the edges like germa dash

1623
05:22:59,979 --> 05:23:05,639
something or story of whatever it is it'd probably be easier to do it that way so i can

1624
05:23:05,639 --> 05:23:27,860
just search for germa right this is a neon part two is it gonna have vr support it's only 2.4 gigs

1625
05:23:30,939 --> 05:23:43,590
yeah they really condensed it down what give people time to build stuff well look uh okay

1626
05:23:43,590 --> 05:23:50,299
let me be completely honest and not joke around here uh i'm gonna do a bunch of

1627
05:23:50,299 --> 05:23:57,689
shit tonight and i'm gonna try to show something tomorrow but if it's very clear that it takes a

1628
05:23:57,689 --> 05:24:04,009
very long time to do anything then maybe i will just say hey in like a week we're gonna do like a

1629
05:24:04,009 --> 05:24:18,779
green screen part two green screen movie night part two but it's dreams and give a tag yeah

1630
05:24:18,779 --> 05:24:23,500
i would just do it just a hashtag germa or have germa being your title or something

1631
05:24:24,299 --> 05:24:51,529
what the hell is a roller coaster that's cool there's no more track is this the end

1632
05:24:51,529 --> 05:25:14,169
do we just fall off neon part three whoa what the hell oh i i revealed the cool game mechanic

1633
05:25:14,169 --> 05:25:44,900
before i was supposed to what is this can i pick this up i'm not exactly sure what i'm looking

1634
05:25:44,900 --> 05:25:54,360
for here but maybe i'll find it i guess not portrait i'm gonna draw a bunch of shit too

1635
05:25:54,360 --> 05:26:08,810
i think we already saw this one yeah wait we already did this another roller coaster

1636
05:26:17,619 --> 05:26:19,220
this has to be by the same person right

1637
05:26:29,029 --> 05:26:54,500
oh okay that was pretty cool wow neon part four is that me that's me doing what i did earlier

1638
05:26:55,220 --> 05:27:17,979
anything else i can do can i go through the window we could have watched all the tutorials

1639
05:27:17,979 --> 05:27:25,639
by now no way and plus here's the thing there's a diff well this is there's a

1640
05:27:25,639 --> 05:27:29,560
difference between watching tutorials for three hours and enjoying a content that people have

1641
05:27:29,560 --> 05:27:36,979
made also these tutorials are pretty in-depth and i'm going to assume it's probably gonna

1642
05:27:36,979 --> 05:27:42,700
take about three hours to do most of them i also want to understand them too somebody made a good

1643
05:27:42,700 --> 05:27:47,959
point where this is really cool uh somebody made a really good point that if i do tutorials

1644
05:27:47,959 --> 05:27:53,959
on stream it's kind of just i sit there quiet while i focus on how to play the game for

1645
05:27:53,959 --> 05:28:03,529
three or four hours so i'm just gonna do it off stream purple pants beta celebration dance

1646
05:28:04,330 --> 05:28:50,840
who is god i would call this unsettling that was it that's the whole thing time corruption

1647
05:28:51,639 --> 05:28:57,500
time has been stopped to prevent further damage agent intervention required one find the time

1648
05:28:57,500 --> 05:29:03,419
control bracelet activate the power nodes enter into the powered singularity to restart the time

1649
05:29:04,540 --> 05:29:19,819
take control of the agent maybe there'll be checkpoints right next what are these checkpoints

1650
05:29:19,819 --> 05:29:47,000
for not tron i like the design of the floors it's almost like made of chalk found the time

1651
05:29:47,000 --> 05:30:05,560
bracelet forward in time oh okay let's see what it's doing very cool oh never mind all right

1652
05:30:07,659 --> 05:30:37,209
wait what's this so close them up okay back here flip them hey look at that in this one

1653
05:30:38,009 --> 05:30:44,060
i wonder when you actually know how to do everything and use the tools correctly i wonder

1654
05:30:44,060 --> 05:30:50,599
how long it takes to make something i guess it really depends on what you want to do you can

1655
05:30:50,599 --> 05:31:00,970
probably do dancing uh disco diaper guy oh god damn it you probably do that in like 30 or 40

1656
05:31:00,970 --> 05:31:23,380
minutes a day of work yeah let's see what i can do oh god how many more of these are there

1657
05:31:37,270 --> 05:31:38,630
i'm not controlling this

1658
05:31:39,349 --> 05:31:55,189
okay lovecraftian horror intro the most merciful thing in the world is the inability

1659
05:31:55,189 --> 05:32:12,580
of the human mind to correlate all its contents as by hp lovecraft that's it that was the intro

1660
05:32:12,580 --> 05:32:19,419
it's a nice snow scene i'm gonna get addicted to this game and want to make all kinds of

1661
05:32:19,419 --> 05:32:24,139
crazy shit i know i will i can already tell something that i'm gonna want to do just sit on

1662
05:32:24,139 --> 05:32:41,419
the couch and make shit for like five straight hours paris purple rain he's back again please

1663
05:32:41,419 --> 05:32:48,310
don't just play little big planet why would i do that when this is their new game this is little

1664
05:32:48,310 --> 05:32:55,669
big planet with like 10 000 times more content you can make everything you can make in little

1665
05:32:55,669 --> 05:32:59,830
big planets

1666
05:33:03,400 --> 05:33:34,889
fuck anybody said i'm not sure i can go anywhere i believe this is a tech demo in the building i

1667
05:33:34,889 --> 05:33:58,779
guess so well maybe we'll see what it is it's like clay but not clay it's a clay and wood

1668
05:33:58,779 --> 05:34:27,349
together whoa here's the outro small glimpse of what's to come follow if you wish to discover

1683
05:39:11,450 --> 05:39:31,159
however it needs to be like this that's pretty cool it's not a bad mechanic that's fun

1684
05:39:32,520 --> 05:39:48,889
is that from 3d world make it on top no i don't think i need to

1685

1689
05:41:17,779 --> 05:41:27,080
this but i want to learn i want to learn how to do everything what's the goal the blue

1690
05:41:31,529 --> 05:41:46,040
double jump of that up again go up come on go now what oh fuck okay this is well made

1691
05:41:48,790 --> 05:42:09,189
now i have to go over here when we get to there oh shit okay and then uh oh hey that's it

1692
05:42:10,340 --> 05:42:19,560
i did it oh i felt like that was gonna happen i knew that was gonna happen i don't know why i

1693
05:42:19,560 --> 05:42:35,130
knew that was gonna happen i knew it i could just feel it for some reason whatever it's fine not

1694
05:42:35,130 --> 05:42:48,259
gonna happen again almost happened again this is a camera was it all just to take a picture

1695
05:42:48,259 --> 05:43:03,159
of myself it was that's cool well i gotta give a thumbs up no i gotta go wait wait wait

1696
05:43:03,720 --> 05:43:27,529
i want a thumbs up oh that's too bad how much this costs 30 bucks 29.99 for what is potential

1697
05:43:27,529 --> 05:43:38,470
to come that's a steal okay this is the grape escape level one jump and double jump press

1698
05:43:38,470 --> 05:43:54,900
and hold r1 for guided line oh it just really i could just i just cheated there's only one

1699
05:43:54,900 --> 05:44:09,619
way to go and i pressed it wait what happened what happened to the link costume is this a

1700
05:44:09,619 --> 05:44:31,779
different kukiri forest there's two of them there's more than one well no link model in this one

1701
05:44:31,779 --> 05:44:52,490
though shops and stuff what about here does it work no i think i need work this is so cool

1702
05:44:53,369 --> 05:45:17,909
this is really well made can i go down here no the deku tree it's been a long time since

1703
05:45:17,909 --> 05:45:30,409
i've played zelda i don't really i don't know where where that is sit up there see

1704
05:45:30,409 --> 05:45:43,159
the other side it's down here right you go through the little forest hallway you're supposed to

1705
05:45:43,159 --> 05:46:10,869
instantly know that wow how do you even make this let me in yeah let me in that's

1706
05:46:10,869 --> 05:46:23,720
sure i can get in oh this is beautiful job well done thumbs that one up it's still like

1707
05:46:23,720 --> 05:46:43,099
the paint tools i have to assume that you can probably use the move controllers right it's

1708
05:46:43,099 --> 05:46:46,459
probably easier to use the move controllers with a lot of this stuff maybe i'll charge

1709

1768
06:03:55,130 --> 06:03:59,990
room guess he doesn't want anyone opening the lock to 211 more of his obsession to make sure

1769
06:03:59,990 --> 06:04:04,150
no one destroys his little experiment i'm over at the stench permeating for this place's foul

1770
06:04:05,029 --> 06:04:07,909

1778
06:06:58,790 --> 06:07:22,490

1779
06:07:22,490 --> 06:07:47,619

1780
06:07:47,619 --> 06:08:11,139
lot of errors press play on the movie we're watching it so wait hold on i think that may

1781
06:08:11,139 --> 06:08:28,630
that may have been it gone rogue maybe there's more is it just playing again i think it's repeating

1782
06:08:32,619 --> 06:08:39,240
we're watching it again all right we're gonna that was cool i think we already saw spring

06:15:16,220 --> 06:15:23,340
activities you can become a specialist at one aspect of dreams what or dabble in every area

1812
06:15:23,340 --> 06:15:29,500
as you like i have to pick a specialization so you can combine your talents and make something

1813
06:15:29,500 --> 06:15:50,470
amazing together oh no what am i going to specialize in level eight yeah but i only

1814
06:15:52,119 --> 06:15:56,040
you like to play you're an explorer of digital worlds you may not spend all your time

1815
06:15:56,040 --> 06:16:01,139

1854
06:26:54,970 --> 06:27:00,569
important realization i love you germa every day you were gone was painful and agonizing

1855
06:27:00,569 --> 06:27:04,169
can't imagine my life without you thought about this long and hard and i could only

1856

think of one solution so here i go jeremy elbertson will you marry me no pressure

1857

or anything but if you say no i'll be very sad uh well i'm gonna have to respectfully decline

1858
06:27:18,580 --> 06:27:25,770
because i um i i don't marry people i don't know it's probably not a good idea

1859

1883
06:31:46,900 --> 06:31:54,259
50 earlier i missed it but thank you for the 50 bucks it's a lot of money they say hey germa

1884
06:31:54,259 --> 06:32:01,700
donated a month ago during securo but somebody one guy got mad at my name and reported me

1885
06:32:02,340 --> 06:32:08,889
so i got banned for 30 days here's some bits back keep up the great stream

1886
06:32:11,400 --> 06:32:14,919
wait hold on if you got banned for 30 days how do you still have the name

1887
06:32:17,700 --> 06:32:29,959
they've banned you for 30 days but they let you keep the name that seems a little odd

1888
06:32:31,909 --> 06:32:42,580
well uh that doesn't make that doesn't make very much sense but thank you for the 50 dollars it's

1889
06:32:42,580 --> 06:32:57,080
a lot of money and you got refunded for the bits maybe he's still banned i don't think so

1890
06:32:59,459 --> 06:33:06,900
but thank you so much for the money that's a lot of money where's the donate option

1891

vinnie had complimented you and it seemed like you hadn't seen the clip so here you go it's

1894

1895
06:33:38,340 --> 06:33:43,529
this one vinnie i'm sure someone already told you but one of his favorite streamers

1896
06:33:44,569 --> 06:33:50,919
i hear germa's doing an ama at the moment so i want to pay back the compliment i don't

1897
06:33:51,000 --> 06:33:54,599
watch a lot of live streams i watch more youtube videos these days

1898
06:33:55,720 --> 06:34:02,840
but germa is one of my favorite people i've ever met that does what i do and he's also

1899
06:34:02,840 --> 06:34:06,919
one of my favorite streamers he's also drunk okay he probably won't mean that

1900
06:34:08,439 --> 06:34:09,639
no i do i did

1901
06:34:12,119 --> 06:34:20,950

1902
06:34:20,950 --> 06:34:26,950
oh he's drunk though i was genuinely upset when germa was not at pax this year as stupid as that

1903
06:34:26,950 --> 06:34:30,790
may sound but he's a really good dude we get along it's a new york boston thing i think

1904
06:34:31,509 --> 06:34:40,020
no i think he's great now how come i because i had a few drinks all of a sudden that negates

1905
06:34:40,020 --> 06:34:54,520
literally everything i said now i stand by it i mean i meant it you've ruined his pax

1906

1919
06:36:41,779 --> 06:36:48,709
with colitis any tips for her thanks big guy you'll always be the best streamer i'm really

1920
06:36:48,709 --> 06:36:55,099
sorry to hear that it's a really really annoying illness uh the best advice i could

1921
06:36:55,099 --> 06:37:03,259
give to somebody that gets diagnosed with colitis is to have a a more basic diet for a little while

1922
06:37:04,299 --> 06:37:12,299
and kind of start introducing foods again to see what kind of throws you off what

1923
06:37:13,020 --> 06:37:16,939
makes you feel better it's hard to tell if you just kind of keep eating the same things

1924
06:37:16,939 --> 06:37:31,220
you normally eat but they've come uh they've come pretty far with the whole colitis and

1925
06:37:31,220 --> 06:37:40,360
medicine and there are things that can really keep people in remission for a while i'm sorry

1926
06:37:40,360 --> 06:37:53,990
to hear that though hopefully hopefully um she can manage it thanks to the 250 i missed another

1927
06:37:53,990 --> 06:37:59,029

1938
06:39:17,909 --> 06:39:21,270
