1
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,969
God damn it, I- really? Why was that turned on? I've been talking for t- okay. I was like,

2
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:42,980
why is nobody sympathizing with me right now? Okay, so listen. Wow, I've been talking for like

3
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,420
five straight minutes, like th- I've been talking for three straight minutes. Anyways,

4
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:57,099
I made a little bit of an oopsie. Uh, I um, I- I kind of was moving a table around,

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,400
because I had to put a table in this room, and I sort of maybe may have fell down and the table

6
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,300
like punched me right in the chest and throat. And it's actually kind of funny because I just

7
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,300
told this story, and I looked over in chat and I saw somebody say liar in all capitals. So I

8
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,020
thought I was unmuted. So I was like, no no no no no, excuse me buddy. I was talking to somebody

9
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,229
in chat. Somebody said liar right after I said this whole story two minutes ago. So I just went

10
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:35,750
off on a rant about that guy. And here's what I was about to say. You- if I was lying, if it was

11
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,270
like, oh I fell down, I oh have I smashed my chest. It would be 2 40 when I start the stream.

12
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,789
It would be an excuse. I'm five minutes early. That's how you know it's not bullshit. Think about

13
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:53,349
that. It would be like, oh 2 45 and I'm just getting started. I fell down. That's why I'm late.

14
00:02:53,349 --> 00:03:02,139
I'm five minutes early. But anyways, uh, yeah that sucked. It like hit me right in the fucking

15
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:08,460
collarbone. It was bad. But I'm a little sore. I'm all right. Don't worry. We've got quite a day.

16
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:17,900
Oh, I hope you're okay. Give me sympathy. Give me sympathy. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Thank you.

17
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,740
Uh anyways, I'm looking over here and I'm just getting real. You know what? We're going back

18
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,780
to- we're going back to 2017 streamer Andy. Those of you that remember that have been around for a

19
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:48,250
while. I've got a stack of PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games. There are about 27 of them.

20
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,889
And I may have gone a little overboard. I'm going to give you a spoiler. I'm going to just tell you

21
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,699
what one or two of them are. Of course, we're starting with Driver. Driver 1 for the PlayStation

22
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:08,219
1. Right after that, I'm just going to give you just what's coming up next. I'm not going to tell

23
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,370
you anything else. We have the Land Before Time Racing Adventure. I feel like a lot of you are

24
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,129
going to be really, really happy about that one. So that's the first two. I'm not going to tell you

25
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:36,810
what the other ones are. Boomer game seems lame. Ban that person for an hour. You better fucking

26
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:48,709
have Crash Team Racing. I'm still stuffed here. No, I don't. No, I do have- no, no spoilers. Why

27
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,910
would I spoil it? I'm going to show it to you. You know what? Fine. Here's your last spoiler.

28
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,589
There are like 30 plus games here. I'm going to tell you one of them. And you need to trust me

29
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,870
on this one because people go like, oh, well, he doesn't have Crash Team Racing. What a fucking

30
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,629
idiot. Am I? Because I got the Bionicle PS2 game. You sitting down now? Are you going to be quiet

31
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:20,519
now? Are you going to quiet down now? Okay. Are you going to quiet down now? Well, I mean,

32
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:28,470
get excited about that, but quiet down after that. He knows his audience. All right. You guys ready?

33
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:39,689
Driver 1 is already ready to go. It's already here. My fucking chest hurts. Holy shit. Bionicle PS2

34
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,000
game. I might not be able to watch the Bionicle movie, but we can play the Bionicle game and

35
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,019
pretend we're watching the movie. Is that okay with you guys? Are you guys ready? Are you guys

36
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,410
ready? We need to do something very first and foremost. I want to make sure because capturing

37
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,920
old- because this is original hardware, by the way. This is original hardware. Capturing old

38
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,370
consoles. It's kind of hard. So we need to do a test. I know it's desynced. We're going to do a test.

39
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:24,360
How badly desynced am I? If I go like this, go, go, go, go, go. How was that? Your voice is

40
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:42,360
desynced. Okay. Hold on. Let's go for that. It should be lined up. How about this? Okay. So that

41
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:50,579
you tell me that's not lined up. Are you hearing me first or is my mouth moving and then you're

42
00:06:50,579 --> 00:07:04,360
hearing me or are you hearing me and then my mouth moving? Which one? We hear you first. Okay. How's

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:15,019
this? How is that? Is that any better? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

44
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:26,089
Is it better? Still bad. It's worse. How does that make any sense? You hear me first? That's

45
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:39,420
impossible. Okay. Hold on. Hello. My name is Jerma. It's really good to see you. How are you doing

46
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:47,579
today? Now it's like two seconds. Wait. People are saying better. People are saying closer. Still bad.

47
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:54,310
Okay. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Better, but still delayed. This is very confusing because here's

48
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,350
how this works for those of you that, you know, those of you that, you know, don't know that that

49
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,709
much about tech like I do. So I, because I'm capturing this console through a capture card,

50
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:10,550
the actual video is delayed. Like the video, the actual video game is delayed by about one full

51
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,750
second. So what I have to do is I have to delay my webcam and delay my voice by the same amount

52
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,579
of time that the video is delayed. And I thought I had it correct, but apparently not because they

53
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:30,089
should match up perfectly. So give me a second. That's weird. So why is that happening? This,

54
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:36,090
we do this now. So I don't have a meltdown in the middle of driver one. You know what I'm saying?

55
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,549
This should not be happening. So is this okay? So you still, are you hearing me first still?

56
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,840
What if I do this? Hi everybody. It's me, Jerma. How's everybody doing? You're doing good.

57
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:55,240
What's what's happening? How are you? But here's the problem. This is why this is going to get

58
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:12,809
weird. Cause watch this one. That's off one, two, three. Now that's delayed. It's two or three

59
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:19,340
seconds off voices. What is it? I don't, I've never had this problem before. I'm, I'm, I'm

60
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:29,059
delaying the video by 500 milliseconds and I'm delaying the audio by 500 milliseconds.

61
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:40,019
So what's happening here? I'm very confused. Is this, how is this? Hold on. Why is this so

62
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,649
fucked up? Okay. So now I'm delaying it again and now it should, it's here we go. One, two,

63
00:09:46,649 --> 00:10:00,070
three, four. It should be synced. No. All right. What? Okay. This is the only time this has ever

64
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,149
happened. So I'm delaying my audio by 500 milliseconds and I'm delaying my video by 500

65
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:13,059
milliseconds. Why are they not matched up? That doesn't make any sense. I'm delaying the audio

66
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:22,100
by 500 and I'm delaying the video by 500. What's going on? What the fuck's happening? The video is

67
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:30,179
slower. Why the fuck is that happening? Hold on. I think I know why. All webcams are trash. That's

68
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:42,710
why. Hold on. All webcams are garbage. Don't believe any of the lies. Hold on. The webcam is slower.

69
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:50,580
I don't get it. Hold on a second. He's reading off of a script. All right. What if I do this?

70
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:13,509
Is it better? One, two, three, four, five. No. What the hell is going on? All right. So let me delay.

71
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,659
We're getting these bugs out of the way first because I cannot tell you why this is happening.

72
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:24,759
Every time you've ever seen a console game, I've done it like this and it's been fine.

73
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:35,370
So what about this? Hi. How are you? Just delay the audio to match the cam. That's what I did.

74
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:47,320
They were both at 500. How is it worse? The webcam is still too late. I've done it like this literally

75
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,700
every single time I've ever delayed the webcam. I don't get it. What happened? What changed? I've

76
00:11:51,700 --> 00:12:00,419
got the PS1. Worst bit. This is not a bit. I swear to God. It doesn't make any fucking sense.

77
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:07,320
How is it getting worse? I don't know because technology is stupid. My webcam is delayed by

78
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,399
500 milliseconds. My audio is delayed by 500 milliseconds. Where are the scientists to

79
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:22,379
explain to me what's going on? Delay the audio by longer. It's going to fuck up how I capture it.

80
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:35,370
Hold on. This is a mess. It's all right. Let's try this. Why would that make any sense? So I'm

81
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:41,129
delaying my audio by 750 and I'm delaying the camera by 500. Excuse me? What's going on here?

82
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:50,870
Hello? Hi. How does that make? How does that make any fucking sense? How does that make any sense?

83
00:12:53,259 --> 00:13:00,340
I need an audio engineer. How does that make any sense? Better? All right. But what about this

84
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:12,950
though? One, two, one, two, one. I got to match the video. The latency difference is malady.

85
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:22,120
Delay the audio by a little bit more. Why? What the fuck thousand times? I've never had to do this

86
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:32,220
before. One, two, one, two, one, two, one. Hi. Hello there. My name is Jerma985. I am ready to stream.

87
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,700
We're getting rid of the technical problems before we start. Am I lip syncing correctly?

88
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:52,460
Yeah. Good enough. Close enough. I don't understand this. All right. Let's go. Are you ready?

89
00:13:53,019 --> 00:14:03,129
I'm closing the lid. That means we got to go. It's serviceable. The camera is like 50 mil. Wait,

90
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,009
hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to get this right. We got, I got like, I'm going to be here

91
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:16,139
all night like this. How's that? Hello, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jerma985. I'm here to stream

92
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:25,539
some PlayStation 1 video games and I am here to describe to you what it feels like to have this

93
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:41,240
controller in my hand. It's still bad. It's not good enough. You overcorrected. What the fuck?

94
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:49,139
I've never had this experience before. No, it's food. Audio is now delayed. Wait, hold on. Let's

95
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:58,870
see if we can get the Goldilocks here. The stream hasn't even started yet. Welcome everyone to a

96
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:19,580
live stream on Twitch.tv. I'm Jerma985. Hi everybody. Welcome. My name is Jerma985.

97
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:30,659
It's a very beautiful day out today. It's a sunny, shining day. Good. It's so close. Clap, clap,

98
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:44,980
clap, clap, clap. Okay. Wait, one, two, one, two. Is that synced? Are we good? Good. Absolutely

99
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:52,789
perfect. Stop over pronouncing words. All right. Don't touch anything. The video might be delayed

100
00:15:52,789 --> 00:16:02,500
slightly. Don't tell me that. Make it, okay. We've been in a nightmare for 10 minutes. People just

101
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,059
showed up. Look, I don't have an intro screen. You just watched it. It was 17 minutes.

102
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:16,899
It's slightly off. Don't tell him it's slightly off. Do head movements to match. Down, up, down,

103
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:43,879
up, down. Are we good? What'd you say? Get a movie clapper. Good. It's actually perfect. Play the

104
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:48,620
game. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Welcome everybody to a PlayStation 1 game.

105
00:16:48,620 --> 00:17:01,139
Let's close the lid. I'm ready. Are you ready? Welcome to PlayStation 1 Grab Bag Night. We're

106
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:11,319
starting with Driver 1. There's somebody on Twitter that has been asking me to play this

107
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:21,849
for, I believe it's been three straight years. Just to let that person know I'm here doing it.

108
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,369
So you're probably going to have to, you're probably going to have to

109
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:34,920
stop doing that Twitter. Why are you so sweaty already? All right. This is GT Interactive

110
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:47,700
Software Presents. This is Driver 1. This is a very important one. Is it going to be too loud?

111
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,660
I got memory cards. I was prepared for this, except for the fact that I had to change my,

112
00:17:50,660 --> 00:18:18,839
whatever. Why did you turn your head that many times? What are you looking for?

113
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:48,099
That was just to prove that this was a 3D game. Am I stealing this car?

114
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:31,690
Is this my car? You've got your parking space. I just imagine the person that ran that Twitter

115
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,049
is sprinting into this room. It's just like, oh, I'm not ready. I didn't know he was even

116
00:19:37,049 --> 00:20:18,299
doing this today. Why is it so loud? Though he was stealing it. Who was that?

117
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:38,700
Have we been just driving around in a circle the whole time? Driver, you are the wheel man.

118
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:51,369
Going back to these old games and seeing these old cut scenes, it's crazy what's been able to

119
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:59,980
happen here. That reminded me of an old GTA machinima, right? Turn the graphics up.

120
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:11,420
Audio is behind. The game audio is behind now. Don't even get started on that. All right. So

121
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:18,740
what do I do? No, no, it's fine. It's fine. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's fine. Just stop,

122
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,700
stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop it. One guy. Okay. So what do I want to do? Undercover car chases,

123
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:42,460
training, cheats. What do I do? Training, right? Car park. Okay. So this is the tutorial.

124
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,019
Somebody said I would not finish this. They said you're never going to finish the tutorial.

125
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:49,980
I think it was like a guarantee you won't beat the first level in Lord of the Rings, right?

126
00:21:49,980 --> 00:22:14,200
What is it trying to show me? Demonstration. Oh, I have to do all those things. Okay.

127
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:30,549
Will you beat the tutorial in 30 minutes? What? You will not beat this.

128
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:48,839
Do a lap. It's no, it's not analog. What? Oh, it's not. Okay. It's not an analog game, right?

129
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:18,740
All right. Let's go. Show us what you got. All right. Did it burn out? So what's handbrake?

130
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:30,329
Oh, this way. This is reverse. Go away. I gotta go fast. What's brake? Okay. Handbrake is what?

131
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:54,809
I think it's L1. Ooh, I got it. 360. Oh, you can only do it four times before it's over.

132
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:11,019
All right. Hold on. Okay. Here we go. What's brake? Okay. Give me the controls.

133
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:24,920
Whoa. I just did it. Okay. Hold on. Reverse 180. So like, is that, how is that not a reverse 180?

134
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:40,900
Reverse 180. It's way, you're doing way to go faster. Who the fuck is this other person up here?

135
00:24:40,900 --> 00:25:04,089
They're annoying me. I'm turning too slow. All right. What's handbrake L1? Wait, this is timed?

136
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:26,539
It's on a timer? No, it's not. Maybe I'll give you a call if I need a ride to the grocery store.

137
00:25:27,339 --> 00:26:10,890
Oh, okay. I don't even understand it. Can I skip this? Okay. I have an idea. This is impossible.

138
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:30,339
What am I even? Lap? What do you mean do a lap? Watch the tutorial again. Okay. Hold on. I thought

139
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:39,180
it was just showing me the buttons. Let me watch it again. Do I even need to beat the tutorial?

140
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:49,190
Okay. Let's watch it. Let me try. Read the instructions. There are no instructions.

141
00:26:49,190 --> 00:27:05,819
It's just like a hand cam of a streamer. That's way better than me. You didn't even get it. He's

142
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:28,410
not even unlocking anything. What? What the fuck? Okay. Here it comes to reverse. I did that. What

143
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:44,380
about speed? How fast can you go here? Okay. So he drives straight into the wall and lap is imagining

144
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:53,339
just a lap around the whole thing. Okay. All right. I get it. Let's go. Ready? Three, two,

145
00:27:53,339 --> 00:28:32,980
one, go. I'll get the speed first. Lap. All right. Wait. What the fuck? Wait. Turn around.

146
00:28:33,859 --> 00:29:11,619
That's not it? I have to weave through these, right? Why is it not doing the 180? No, I'll get

147
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:16,710
it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.

148
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:28,329
I'll get it. I'll get it. Don't worry. I got it. I got it. Speed first. Okay. Now we're going to

149
00:29:28,329 --> 00:30:00,630
do reverse. How is that too slow? How is it too slow? You're turning too early. I don't understand.

150
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:35,900
Just tap the handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Dude, this, I don't, why can I not do a 180?

151
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,579
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Use the steering wheel. I'm doing, I'm using,

152
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:05,849
follow the ghost car. I thought you said that was my ghost car. Why would I follow this shitty

153
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:13,509
ghost car that I, it's not me. Wait, that's not me. I, oh, I thought that was me.

154
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:48,339
Like Mario Kart style. All right. Come on. Come on. I don't get the reverse 180. I can't do it.

155
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:14,710
I don't, I don't understand. I can't get it to work. How is that not a reverse 180?

156
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:23,539
I'm only doing this for five minutes. This is why everybody wanted me to play it. All right.

157
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:34,470
Play driver one. Don't tell them. Yeah. Cause this tutorial is stupid. Yeah. I remember reading

158
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,750
the reviews on this. Yeah. Like, I don't understand. Like I guess can't beat the tutorial. Like,

159
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,869
I don't know. What were they thinking? What were they thinking? You know what I mean? That's,

160
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:55,529
that's what I, that's where I am right now. I give up. I don't even care. I'm just gonna play

161
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:04,490
the game. I'm just, I think I'm just playing the game. You can't bail on the tutorial game

162
00:33:04,490 --> 00:34:06,410
journalist. Don't, I'll get it right now. Five minutes. Ah, how was that not a reverse 180?

163
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:45,159
That's exactly what I just did. Escape sucks. I'm done. I'm not playing it anymore. It's, it,

164
00:34:45,159 --> 00:35:09,980
it handles like a wet sock. Everybody was waiting for me to play this. You guys were all just like,

165
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,380
I can't wait. Here we go. Guaranteed fucking meltdown scream. No, it's not.

166
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:55,030
I'll give you a fucking meltdown right here. Get out of here. What do you got? Come on. Come on.

167
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,940
I'm not going to lose the tutorial and driver. Uh-uh. That should be about even 30 minutes.

168
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:16,070
How long does that take? How long does it take? That was less than 30 minutes. Who do you think

169
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:32,940
you are? Oh, who do you think you are? I am. All right. I did it. All right. Let's play driver one.

170
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:44,119
All right. So we got undercover new game. Truth is Tanner, three years on the department and you're

171
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,769
still the best driver I got. We don't get too many ex-racing boys in here. Lowlife rumble in Miami

172
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:57,800
is there's a hunt on for a guy who can pump the gas. Big getaway, big job, maybe even some kind

173
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:06,170
of hit. Some hood by the name of Rufus is in the picture. We need a line on it. Coffee? Yeah. Black,

174
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:16,440
right? Guys upstairs were asking for you in person. Look, we need you to go under, but no one's going

175
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:24,019
to know except me. If I bring anyone else in very wanted, by the way, why do they need your badge?

176
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:44,280
Any questions? Wait, I'm a police officer undercover. Remember this game is old. Yeah.

177
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:54,440
What is this? I just did this. I just did this. Why do I have to do this? I just did it.

178
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:40,489
Why do I have to do this again? What the fuck? No, I don't have to do this again. Do I? That was

179
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:48,949
the training. That was not the tutorial. Okay. Why did you let me do that? Why weren't you guys

180
00:38:48,949 --> 00:38:54,150
screaming at the top of your lungs for me not to do training to get right into the new game?

181
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:27,059
Shit. Why am I doing this? I should have already did it. Why weren't you screaming at me?

182
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:55,219
We're going to do lap first. Give me that fucking 180. I didn't. Okay. The slalom slalom slalom.

183
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,780
Oh, fuck. No, you have to start with that. You have to start with slalom.

184
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:23,690
Do you have to start with that? There's no way you have to start with that. It's literally

185
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:30,650
impossible if you don't. I can't believe I'm doing this twice. I cannot fucking believe it. I can't

186
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,889
believe it. I forget how to start. I forget where you start it. You go like this way, right?

187
00:40:37,429 --> 00:40:59,659
Do I start left or right? I already did it. I don't remember where to start

188
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,050
because you have to do the slalom fucking perfectly or it doesn't register. Oh my God. I

189
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:33,719
hate this game. How the fuck does that not count already? Now is that not a 180? What

190
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:51,940
fucking crack is this game smoking? How did I not just do the stupid giving up empty parking garage?

191
00:41:52,659 --> 00:42:28,119
All right, let's go off with this. Turn faster.

192
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:37,079
Guys, it's a PlayStation one game. There's no pressure sensitive turning. It's either held

193
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:58,659
right or don't at all. How is that not a fucking 180? I just I'm doing a reverse 180.

194
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,280
What are you speaking of? What are you speaking of? How is that not a reverse 180?

195
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:53,690
What are you speaking of? We've got a job only you can handle. We need you to go on your cover and

196
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,650
go find those criminals. And by the way, can you slalom around these 10 times while I watch?

197
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:00,570
No, fuck you, buddy.

198
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:46,420
How do I burn out? How do I burn out? How do I burn out? How do I burn out?

199
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,300
How do I burn out? Tell me. Somebody tell me quick. How do I burn out? Quick.

200
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:10,039
Maybe I'll give you a call when I need a ride. How do I burn out? Circle. Oh my. You're a whiny

201
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:19,719
baby. It's a specific button to burn out. You tell me there's a burnout button on this fucking

202
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:27,690
computer video game. There's a circle is burnout. It's not handbrake and gas, right? It's not break

203
00:45:27,690 --> 00:46:40,409
and get right. Like, okay. Okay. It's a button. Oh, I got it. Wait, save the game. I'm not doing

204
00:46:40,409 --> 00:47:08,389
that ever again. I don't care. Just eat. Did I do it? All right. Thank God. Okay. Wait. Oh,

205
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:14,570
there it is. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Very good. Very good. All right. We're good.

206
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,929
It's been 45 minutes. Well, technically it didn't start and it's been about 25 minutes. We're good.

207
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:42,059
We're ready. Why is it a different menu? Options? Get a new job. Why am I crawling around on the

208
00:47:42,059 --> 00:48:04,599
floor? Okay. New job. You have one new message. Okay. We want to use you to be real sleepy.

209
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:25,340
You want it? Um, do I have to call them back? Oh, okay. Let's go. It's Charlie and Frank's

210
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:38,460
apartment from Always Sunny. It's bright. Bellany? Wait, why do I have one? We have one minute to

211
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,340
rob a bank. Why are we doing this in the amount of time it takes to watch a YouTube short? What's

212
00:48:45,340 --> 00:49:03,380
fucking, what are we talking about? Where is it? One minute? Wait, up here? Is this a bank?

213
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:23,880
That's not a bank. What is the bank over here? Where is this bank? Bro, this is somebody's house.

214
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:49,619
Oh, there's like a big thing over here on the mini-map. Is it that way? Is it right there?

215
00:49:50,340 --> 00:50:17,849
It's right there. Yeah! What? It's right, what? We're right here. What are you talking about?

216
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:47,739
What? Nice Target t-shirt. Wait, oh, you can, oh. Nope. I don't even know what the mini-map was

217
00:50:47,739 --> 00:51:05,420
trying to tell me before. This is it. We're good. We're good. I got it. I thought there was a side

218
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:12,329
street I could cut through. I did the same exact thing. Move your fat head. I can't see.

219
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:47,539
My god, get out of the fucking way. What did I drive? Directly in, I was trying so desperately

220
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:53,380
to avoid that pole, and I drove directly into its square. Exactly, directly dead center of the car.

221
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,019
I was so obsessed with trying to avoid that. That's why I did what I just did.

222
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:35,349
Excuse me. Please don't fall off. All right, I got it. I'm right here. Too early? What do you

223
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:57,829
mean it's too early? What? Why are we picking up a Star Trek crew? Why did Captain Kirk just come

224
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:37,349
out? What was that? Where are we going? Where do we go? Fuck. Okay. Why is time going up? Wait,

225
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:51,539
am I gaining time or losing time? I'm so confused. What? Am I gaining time or was I, the time counted

226
00:53:51,539 --> 00:54:06,579
down and then it was counting up? The game is so loud. Okay, this is a stopwatch. So I have to be

227
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:12,170
here within 10 seconds and then I have to, I thought I was up against the clock. I wasn't.

228
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:18,539
I kept looking up and seeing, oh, 20 seconds left, 30 seconds left, 40 seconds left. I was like,

229
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:24,489
how am I, am I running over little like watches or something? All right, I got it right now.

230
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:58,949
Wait, I took the wrong turn again. Okay, it doesn't matter because I have to be here within

231
00:54:58,949 --> 00:55:13,639
10 seconds anyways. I'm here too early half the time. Nobody said it's still way too loud.

232
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:42,260
That was a 3D movie maker effect. Okay, here we are. Don't show up too early. Okay, now we go.

233
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:52,889
Pick everybody up. Here comes the whole, okay, now we get out of here. But I don't, I don't have to

234
00:55:52,889 --> 00:56:31,159
freak out here. I want to go up this main highway. All right, let's go. There's way too many people

235
00:56:31,239 --> 00:57:12,179
on the road here. Oh, what the fuck? Go, go, go, go, go, go. Okay. I think I was weaving around and

236
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:55,000
the police officer ran into somebody. No, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Let's go.

237
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:13,219
Minute 45. What's wrong with that? This game is kind of fun. Oh, by the way, for those of you that

238
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:18,869
are wondering every 30 to 40 minutes, we switch games. It's been an hour and I haven't switched

239
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:35,289
too bad. And the intro was 20 minutes. That's true. We didn't really get into this until about

240
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:46,039
20 minutes ago. I still got about 20 minutes. There's so many games behind me. It is a daunting

241
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:51,860
amount of video games in CDs that are right here. I look back and it's like, oh my goodness. Okay,

242
00:58:51,860 --> 00:59:00,980
we've got a lot to do. 20 plus 20 is 30. Well, 30 to 45 usually is the dealer. All right,

243
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:08,570
what about another job? Show them? No, I don't want to give any spoilers.

244
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:40,389
Who's censoring my calls for me? Was he doing that on his end?

245
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:58,150
Name's Deco. Which one should I do? That's it? He definitely left another message and just said,

246
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:12,380
it's me. Oh no, I skipped it. Which one should I do? The first one? All right, we'll do one more

247
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:30,760
and see how I feel. And then we're going to move on to this next one. Hide the evidence. Okay.

248
01:00:33,159 --> 01:01:16,710
Take it to the breakers. New car. This car handles a lot differently. This dude is relentless. Get

249
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:23,510
away from me. Oh wait, his car got fucked up. All right, you can't hit anybody. Stop telling me to.

250
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:48,889
We're going to do this again. When is the driver? I know. What? I thought you said driver two.

251
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:21,960
Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. I get it. Good. Stop. Who cares? Just go. Why do I care so much about

252
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:50,789
doing that? It's like just burning in the back of my head. Shit. What? There's a roadblock.

253
01:02:51,510 --> 01:03:31,019
Okay. We're not going that way. We're going a different way. Where's the cop? Okay. Great.

254
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:52,469
And left and then right. I tried to hit every single object on the way over here. Okay.

255
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:25,429
Got no cops right now. That's good. I got to do the Mario Kart technique. How have you not

256
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:37,380
crashed already? Everybody does. If you do that in front of somebody, they freak out because they

257
01:04:37,380 --> 01:05:01,429
don't want to hit you while they're passing you. And then you'll make them spin out. How have you

258
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:36,940
not crashed into somebody? Let's go. This place is far away. Oh, that jump did nothing for me at all

259
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:42,309
and ruined everything actually. I was supposed to go off that way faster. That was very lame.

260
01:05:45,849 --> 01:06:11,769
I was supposed to go off that five times faster. That was lame. We're good. We're good. We're good.

261
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:37,400
We're good. One more. Blow right by this cop right here. 180. I love when cars harmonize in

262
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:59,099
video games, don't you? You know, like we're harmonizing. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop.

263
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:34,619
We're good. Nice. You should stick to TikTok. Dude, I've never opened the app TikTok once.

264
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:50,619
Whenever I tell you guys about watching TikTok, it's like going to TikTok.com and using getting

265
01:07:50,619 --> 01:08:03,980
a link that somebody sent. I've never opened it. Or I look at TikTok compilation videos.

266
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:08,949
That's the same thing. Is it? I don't have like a TikTok account. Somebody's like, oh, look at this

267
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:15,639
TikTok video I found. I just opened it on like a website. I go, oh, that was okay. I don't care.

268
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:28,359
You're addicted. I don't watch TikTok. I don't. Stop it. That's worse. What do you mean? How is

269
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:40,539
that worse? All right. We'll do one more mission and then we'll move on. We want to talk to you.

270
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:47,960
We want to talk to you. That's it? The marino. Oh. We'll just hang loose till you get your ass

271
01:08:47,960 --> 01:09:03,689
round here. Okay. Am I going to get double crossed? You need to do driver one all stream. No.

272
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:10,390
No, that's not happening. It's like, it's like 500 games behind me.

273
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:28,939
All right. I'm actually timed for this one. Go meet them. Is that, are they on the map right there?

274
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:34,539
Where is, where is, where are they? What am I? I don't know. Where am I supposed to be going?

275
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:53,289
Like over here? Hey, driver crawled so GTA could walk. Okay. All you haters in the chat right now.

276
01:09:54,010 --> 01:10:20,659
What'd I do? GTA one came out probably like five years before this game. Do I have to bring the

277
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:36,659
cops? What did you say? Play it. Driver was made for aliens so they wouldn't get attached to earth.

278
01:10:41,560 --> 01:11:12,069
What does that even mean? Where's this? Where's the road? So the frame rate drops to like zero

279
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:28,420
right there. Look at this. Why is it chugging so hard? Which road should I go on? This one or the

280
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:59,750
big one? All right. I just bounced. Oh, come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go, punch, punch, punch, punch.

281
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:18,939
This is so far away still. There's no way I do this one. One more try and that's it. That's it.

282
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:23,189
One last try and then I'm going to put in a different game. Final one last try. One try.

283
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:52,550
That was, that one didn't count. That one didn't count. Okay. Go. I'm going to, I'm not going to

284
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:59,369
go right. I'm going to go straight here. Right. And then go down this road up here.

285
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:09,130
This one right here. Yep. Yep. Okay. Go, go, go, go. Down this main highway right here.

286
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,380
Why was I speeding? Why am I in trouble? I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.

287
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:32,939
Did I do it? Did I fuck it up? I went down the wrong thing, didn't I?

288
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:40,600
No, I'm okay. I'm all right. Can I go down this way? I can't tell from the map.

289
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:51,829
Dude, I can't, I can't tell from the map. Oh, come on. Doesn't it look like I can drive down there?

290
01:13:52,869 --> 01:14:03,220
What even is that? I'm doing this one more time. I swear to God. You did the same mistake. All

291
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:06,819
right. I'm not making that mistake again. This is the last try and then I'm putting in a,

292
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:18,949
I'm putting in the land before time racing adventure. I'm not making that same mistake

293
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:33,130
every time. I'm going left. You're going to think it's crazy, but I'm doing it.

294
01:14:36,949 --> 01:15:03,750
Now we're going to go right up here and then I'm going to go straight and then we're going to go

295
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:40,819
right up here and straight. Go. Just stay straight the whole time. There we go. Okay. We're good.

296
01:15:40,819 --> 01:16:04,489
All right. There's a roadblock up here. I feel through very slowly.

297
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:40,550
That fucking idiot wasn't in the way. This is fine. All right. I think he crashed.

298
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:59,159
Where's the entrance? Where's the entrance? Isn't there a bigger entrance?

299
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:14,789
What? I thought there was a, I thought there was a bigger entrance. I went way too far. All right.

300
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:18,149
This is it right here. If I don't get it right here, I'm literally turning off the console and

301
01:18:18,149 --> 01:19:02,680
pulling up this. Sorry. Where's the road I can go down? Is it this one here? I don't know. The

302
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:48,060
big shadow is taking up the whole mini map. I don't, I can't see. Why are my eyes so watery?

303
01:19:56,729 --> 01:20:02,970
No, no, no. It was the wrong road. Oh my God. It's the wrong fucking road.

304
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:30,250
There's one road to get over there. There's one road and it's check it out. This is it right here.

305
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:50,970
I swear to God. I swear to God. This is it. I got it right here. I got it. It was a perfect,

306
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:55,529
there was no avoiding that car crash. They were coming from every piece,

307
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:01,449
every angle. There was no escaping. Everyone was driving to stop me from completing this mission.

308
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:27,100
Stop driving into me. All right. Here it is. This one right here. Go.

309
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:52,739
Making good time. Good time. Nope. It's not the wrong road. Look,

310
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:55,619
I was up to the one to the right, the road to the right. That's when I was up before.

311
01:21:55,619 --> 01:23:00,100
I'm on the right one. There's a block here. Save. Stop talking. I got it for sure. Yes.

312
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:17,340
Need you to make an exchange. This case for a locker key. It's a sweet deal.

313
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:23,579
Cash for a key in and out. Wham, bam, boom. Meet them at the marina. Get the key or stay out of town.

314
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:31,989
This message is crazy. I just slammed my head so hard against the top of my door frame, putting up

315
01:23:31,989 --> 01:23:37,800
lights. And all I could hear was the obscenely loud sirens playing from the game on my laptop.

316
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:46,439
For a second, I truly believed I fucking died to a germistream. Oh no. You all right?

317
01:23:48,119 --> 01:23:58,300
Wait, what's this? All right, we're doing it. Last one, I promise. The last thing you hear

318
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:07,260
is like, I don't understand. I don't get it. No, I hit the brake button. I hit the brake button.

319
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:19,500
I hit the brake. Whoa, that's a weird thing. I don't know about that one. That's terrifying.

320
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:53,930
Go over the jump. I'm so angry at myself for missing that. Very annoyed at myself. I think

321
01:24:54,010 --> 01:26:05,739
I got it. I'm almost there. I'm almost there. That was driver one and it was a good one.

322
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:12,630
We played that for a little while. It was fun. Worth the wait, I think. But coming up next,

323
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:22,199
we've got the land before time racing adventure. This is going to be crazy, I think. This is going

324
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:32,260
to be crazy. Oops. Wait, what? Oh, wait, I want to do this. No, I got it. Why did that just happen?

325
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:38,539
All right. Finally, it's time for a real game. I mean, driver one is a very popular real game.

326
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:47,109
Here we go. Yeah, for the game that I'm playing. Yeah, just leave it as retro. There's no reason

327
01:26:47,109 --> 01:26:51,670
to change it. They'll be cycling so much. It's not worth it. All right, here we go. Land before time.

328
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:08,649
Yeah, I'm on a PS2 right now. PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1. You have a PS2. At least the slim

329
01:27:08,649 --> 01:27:14,279
model. I don't know. At least the slim model, whatever that means. Is that the one that's

330
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:25,930
backwards compatible? Because if you have a PS2 slim, you can play PS1 games in it.

331
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,779
Are they all backwards compatible? Okay.

332
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:59,449
That was wild. Okay. If you gave me a million dollars, I wouldn't be able to name one character.

333
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:24,890
This is infomercial music when they're showing off the grill. And introducing the new wave oven.

334
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:42,329
Cook. Clean. Store. You need at least one free block in the memory card in slot one. Okay.

335
01:28:43,449 --> 01:28:52,630
Reading memory card. Land before time. Great balancing adventure. What do I do? Obstacle

336
01:28:52,630 --> 01:29:08,090
courses. Pick an obstacle course. Free star dash. Rolling hills dash. Dino dash. Stone den dash.

337
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:54,979
Right. Ducky. How about either Ducky or Spike? All right, here we go. We're just going. Holy

338
01:29:54,979 --> 01:29:59,779
shit. This game is awesome. This is like the iPhone run games before they were popular.

339
01:30:03,449 --> 01:30:38,090
Oops. Oh, I didn't jump. Okay. I'm good. Sorry. Oh my God. Whoa. You can. Okay. You can swim on

340
01:30:38,090 --> 01:31:12,250
that. What's the time I need to beat? There we go. Ooh. Got it. I think you go faster if you collect

341
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:51,500
flowers. I don't know how you do that reliably. I don't understand. Not bad. That wasn't that bad.

342
01:31:51,500 --> 01:32:04,680
This looks like you if you were nice. Oh, I didn't do it. I think I could do. All right. What about

343
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:12,199
this one? What Dino dash? Let's try this one. We'll do Ducky. Maybe they all have different traits.

344
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:30,119
140 is what I need. Okay. Well, now I understand what kind of game it is. I didn't know what it

345
01:32:30,119 --> 01:33:01,430
was before. It's like an auto run game. I don't know. I jumped over it. I think you have to go

346
01:33:01,430 --> 01:34:18,579
through the middle of those. Yeah. You can't jump over those. I got it. All right. 140. There's more.

347
01:34:18,579 --> 01:34:38,199
I'm so sorry. I love that harsh audio clipping that you hear. It's like reading memory card. You

348
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:51,050
hear that just noise. Oh, okay. I got my unlocked more. All right. Let me get this one then. We'll

349
01:34:51,050 --> 01:35:08,409
do Sarah. After this, we'll do a race. Can you please drink from a hamster water bottle? No.

350
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:29,609
We already went over why that stream would be bad. Why? Because it would be stupid.

351
01:35:33,619 --> 01:35:37,699
Anytime I ever think of something that we fund or interesting to do on stream for like a show or an

352
01:35:37,699 --> 01:35:44,020
event, I think about the one thing I think is funny. And then I go, all right, can it be built

353
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:49,779
off of that one thing I think is funny? And yeah, me drinking out of a hamster bottle is funny.

354
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:55,399
But then imagine the panic I would have to have to fill like three or four hours of a stream

355
01:35:56,869 --> 01:36:06,060
doing what exactly that's like, I would be in like a hamster costume. I would do the funny. Look,

356
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:13,020
I'm drinking out of the thing. And then I'd have a panic attack internally going. What else does

357
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:21,960
there do now? Oh my God, this how much does this cost? I would just be like, there's nothing else

358
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:30,630
to do. There's nothing else funny. What else is funny that could happen right now? This is bullshit.

359
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:41,270
Just walk across it, babe. It would be a one minute stream. It would just be you running in

360
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:57,930
the hamster. I would sprint on that hamster wheel and I would trip and I would go. I would fall and

361
01:36:57,930 --> 01:37:02,939
just kind of be spinning in it. I would just puke. And then the stream would have to turn off and I'd

362
01:37:02,939 --> 01:37:22,250
get banned for a week. What a fucking terrible stream. All right. How about a windy ridge race?

363
01:37:23,609 --> 01:38:04,789
Ducky hamster wheel subathon. Oh, no way. Oh my God. I was trying to cut the corner. Get it.

364
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:14,789
Why do I? Why is this? Why can I? What song is this?

365
01:38:21,189 --> 01:38:32,409
What song is this? What is that? This is a real song. Turn around.

366
01:38:33,369 --> 01:38:40,380
Turn around. Yeah, that's what it is. Okay. Turn around every now and again. I get a little bit

367
01:38:40,380 --> 01:39:10,090
closer. Turn around. No, it's different now. Play that song. Hold on. He's going to pass me.

368
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:15,449
He's going to lap me. Turn around every now and then I get a little bit closer.

369
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:41,829
Turn around every now and then I get a little bit more. Is this it?

370
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:05,939
That's the joke version? What? What do you mean joke version?

371
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:22,300
Why did you link me the joke version? There's a parody version of this song. I linked both.

372
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:27,500
Yeah, the first one doesn't work. It says video content unavailable. It's been blocked by display

373
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:45,239
on this website. Turn around every now and then I get a little. Just click the link itself. What?

374
01:40:45,239 --> 01:41:15,899
Is this it? I can't hear it. Yes. When does it say turn around?

375
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:27,560
I feel like I feel like there hasn't even been any singing yet.

376
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:37,239
It just happened. They're doing it now. Oh, I can't hear it. It's been said three times now.

377
01:41:37,239 --> 01:41:45,850
All right. Well, whatever. I can't hear it. My headphones are not plugged into my computer.

378
01:41:45,850 --> 01:42:00,579
They're plugged into the game. All right. Well, I fucking lost. Who cares? Like,

379
01:42:00,579 --> 01:42:05,819
I'm not going to finish it out. All right. One more. That entire song is him saying,

380
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:26,569
turn around a billion times. All right. Let's go. All right. One more. I'm going to win.

381
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:51,399
Why are you taking the lead? I did everything perfectly. No, I did everything perfectly.

382
01:42:51,399 --> 01:43:17,670
It makes no sense. Why are you so fast? What is happening? He's blown by me completely.

383
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:39,930
There's a sprint button. There is now that I know that I'll try it again. You suck. I didn't even

384
01:43:39,930 --> 01:43:50,699
know what the buttons were. OK, 30 minutes. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.

385
01:43:51,260 --> 01:44:55,430
Read the manual. There is no manual. Let's go. You stupid. Oh, my God. One little mistake and

386
01:44:55,430 --> 01:46:38,619
he's so far ahead already. How have I not gotten any ground on it? I have to beat this motherfucker

387
01:46:38,619 --> 01:46:45,560
so bad. I have to beat this guy. I have to beat him. I have to beat this. I have to beat him.

388
01:46:45,560 --> 01:47:03,079
I can't move on until I beat him. I'm curious. You look different. Have you had plastic surgery?

389
01:47:03,079 --> 01:47:11,899
I've not had plastic surgery. No, I've just aged like 12 years. No, I haven't. I haven't gotten

390
01:47:11,899 --> 01:47:44,699
plastic surgery. Why are you asking that? You took that. I needed it. All right. Stop. He's so far

391
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:51,720
ahead already. He didn't even collect any of the flowers. This is horseshit. Oh, my God. I can do

392
01:47:51,720 --> 01:48:04,739
it. I can do it. I'm going to quiet down. Quiet. We're at a joint. It's been flipping hamburgers

393
01:48:04,739 --> 01:48:43,239
since 1910. This is Guy Fury music. You know, I come here for the atmosphere. It's always fresh,

394
01:48:43,239 --> 01:48:54,699
always awesome. Great atmosphere back in the kitchen. Like, I quit. I quit. I need to restart

395
01:48:54,699 --> 01:49:11,479
it. Craggy cave. I can do it. You got plastic surgery. I'm not going to get plastic surgery.

396
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:15,909
I'm not going to get plastic. The only time I've ever thought about getting plastic surgery

397
01:49:15,909 --> 01:49:20,630
is like maybe fixing my turkey neck eventually. But I don't know. I don't think I'm going to do

398
01:49:20,630 --> 01:50:40,250
that. I don't have a reason to. Oh, you just got destroyed. Why are you so much faster? Stop.

399
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:51,159
I quit. One more time. If you played this music in a room with two people, they would kill each

400
01:50:51,159 --> 01:51:03,510
other. Why? No, I wouldn't. I actually wouldn't do that. I would go, this music's kind of weird.

401
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:09,300
Yeah, I'd like to leave the room now. Who cares?

402
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:41,609
This game is fucking impossible. I would have cried if I was a kid playing this.

403
01:51:44,409 --> 01:52:33,399
I would have cried playing this. Don't pick that up. I want that. How are you right up my ass

404
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:53,159
already? How are you this close to me still? Don't lose right now because the music is so funny.

405
01:52:54,500 --> 01:53:20,859
Go. He's right there. Please die. No, no, I didn't. I didn't say die. I said doi.

406
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:43,239
I said doi. Don't touch that. It's mine. Got it. Yes. Oh, thank God. Thank God. I don't have to do

407
01:53:43,239 --> 01:54:09,880
it again. Thank goodness. That was fun game. How you guys feel? One more. All right. What do we

408
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,880
got next? Oh, this one's going to be, I feel like I'm going to be in this one for a long time.

409
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:27,000
Do I pull that out now? Okay. I'm going to give you guys a choice. We might be in this one for

410
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:42,699
a little while. Would you rather see mods make a poll? Oh, okay. The options are

411
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:55,909
Hey guys. Damn. Countdown. Countdown vampires or the golden nugget video game. It's a casino game.

412
01:54:56,869 --> 01:55:04,840
And there's apparently 30 minutes of live action. Adam West video. I don't know what that means. I

413
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:12,600
just know that it's in the game. I don't know what that means. I mean, we're going to play in

414
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:27,060
both, but which one do you want first? I don't think it's even close. Golden nugget casino game

415
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:38,100
or countdown vampires. All right. It's not even remotely close. That was fun. That was actually

416
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:53,560
really cute. It was land before time adventure racing. I think this is two discs. Yeah. Two

417
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:58,119
discs. I'm going to have to put discs in to load up cut scenes. I bet it's going to be a disaster.

418
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:19,619
Let's try. Here comes the golden nugget video game. 81%. Oh my God. That's a lot. That's actually an

419
01:56:19,619 --> 01:56:56,520
unbelievable number. Okay. Let's go. No casino game will ever be like Vegas steaks. Sure about

420
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:55,420
that. Okay. Is that me in the limo? Going to Las Vegas. The window going to roll down. Is it

421
01:57:55,420 --> 01:58:44,500
going to be Adam West? Pull it up to the golden nugget. Is it one person? Okay. Let's go. It looks

422
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:51,779
like chocolate. Start or options? I mean, what could the options be? Background, sound effects,

423
01:58:51,779 --> 01:58:57,449
computer players on card animation. I guess we're just keeping it the way it is. Okay. Let's go.

424
01:58:58,010 --> 01:59:22,619
Let's do it. Welcome to the fabulous golden nugget. Visit the registration desk. Do I have to? Oh,

425
01:59:22,619 --> 01:59:29,000
no. If you haven't saved your game yet, your current game will be lost. Steve. What's my name?

426
01:59:29,000 --> 02:00:08,250
Steve Killsberg. Steve Killsberg. Killsberg. What do? Okay. I need a new name. How much money do I

427
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:22,300
have? Where's my money? What is that thing? What is it? What did I just click on? Oh shit. Maximum

428
02:00:22,300 --> 02:00:29,619
bit of thousand. How much money do I have? 50, 20, 10. I have like 200 bucks. How much money do I

429
02:00:29,619 --> 02:00:45,609
have? Go forward. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. You know, all right. Blackjack. Let's start with Blackjack.

430
02:00:45,609 --> 02:00:51,689
Go all in. Okay. I'll go all in on the first hand. I don't even know what, do I have to put a dollar

431
02:00:51,689 --> 02:01:11,819
up? Okay. How much did I just bet? Stand. Did I say that? What do I have here? 13 is four. Stand.

432
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:35,060
All right. How much money did I just bet? How much money am I betting? Oh shit. There we go. Okay.

433
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:43,779
Nine versus king. Oh, hit. I'm busted. Sorry. Sorry to hear that. I'll take a card. That's not good.

434
02:01:43,779 --> 02:01:57,340
Stand. All right. Hey, look at that. Is that 500? What just happened? Wait, what's going on here?

435
02:01:57,340 --> 02:02:09,239
What just happened? What's going on? What's happening? Oh shit. That was 500. All right.

436
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:25,210
I got it. I got it. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. All right. Jack. Oh, 13 versus an eight.

437
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:35,960
16 versus eight. I have to take another card. 22. Hit. Hit me. I'm busted. All right. That's all

438
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:44,039
right. Sorry. I lose anyways. I would have lost anyways. All right. One more. How much money do I

439
02:02:44,039 --> 02:02:52,939
have? All right. I have to stop after this. Let's see an ace right there. Perfect. Perfect. Blackjack.

440
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:10,489
Nice. What? Oh, that's fucking stupid. I have no money left. It's over.

441
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:23,350
Let's not stand. We're in. Stand. 15. There it is. We're back. How to pronounce stand in English.

442
02:03:25,189 --> 02:03:52,250
Stand. Why do I have zero dollars? Okay. And here's the question. Stand. Yes.

443
02:03:54,890 --> 02:04:04,039
Stand. Is that I win, right? Did I win? What is that? How much did I win? Seven. 14.

444
02:04:05,399 --> 02:04:17,430
You fucking piece of shit game. What? A 21 again? What happens if I have no money? Oh, I have

445
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:28,539
special. I have markers. Okay. All right. Cool. That bet is over the table maximum.

446
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:49,500
I guess I'll do 5,000 then. I only won twice. Whatever. It's okay. It's all right. It's all

447
02:04:49,500 --> 02:05:00,710
right. What do we got here? Roulette. Slots. All right. Slots. We'll just do slots. We'll do

448
02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:07,260
slots. We'll go to Eureka. Where is Adam West? I don't know. It says this is like an hour of

449
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:20,789
footage. All right. This is one dollar. Okay. How do I, how do I, I don't want to bet $5,000.

450
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:39,289
How do I get rid of that? How do I do this? I can't click spin. I can't click bet.

451
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:47,560
I can't hit. Oh, okay. Well, there we go. All right. Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Oh.

452
02:05:49,159 --> 02:06:12,310
How much money am I putting in? Okay. Let's do a hundred. I hope Adam West like bumps into me.

453
02:06:12,310 --> 02:06:25,529
It just dumps a drink on me or something. Okay. So that's about $500. Why are there dynamite?

454
02:06:25,529 --> 02:06:33,979
Why is it spinning again? Why is it doing this? What's happening? Why is it doing this? I'm not

455
02:06:33,979 --> 02:07:04,659
doing this. What's going on? Why is it doing this? I have a hundred credits still. Why? I didn't say

456
02:07:04,659 --> 02:07:27,670
I'm spending money. That was one spin. I'm so confused. I don't know what just happened.

457
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:47,979
All right. Come on. Come on. Was that food and scrambled eggs? Gold, gold. Oh, five. I'll take

458
02:07:47,979 --> 02:08:17,590
it. Three. Oh, that's when we leave. All right. Take it out. 6,125. Let's go. All right. Nice. Okay.

459
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:25,180
That's good. Look at that. I have one hundred. That's it. I feel like I've spent a lot. Play

460
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:53,060
story mode. Isn't, am I not doing story mode? This is story mode. How do I do story mode? I think,

461
02:08:53,060 --> 02:09:06,340
I think we're okay. That's one guy. All right. How about, how about roulette? Where's roulette?

462
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:18,789
Right here. You didn't tweet your stream on. Oh, shit. Sorry. Okay. Let me show you my roulette

463
02:09:18,789 --> 02:09:29,460
strategy. I don't want that much. How do I get rid of that? All right. So was it, I'm doing a hundred,

464
02:09:29,460 --> 02:09:36,489
I'm doing two hundred bucks. Not this much, but you know what I mean. Two hundred dollars is going

465
02:09:36,489 --> 02:09:42,020
where I would do in a corner bet right here. But this is four hundred bucks, right? So I need 11,

466
02:09:42,020 --> 02:10:00,260
12, 14, 15, 17, 18. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. I'm ready. Spin it. All right. Go. Okay.

467
02:10:02,199 --> 02:10:18,779
I came to see what it is. Eleven. How much is that? How much did I just win? That was

468
02:10:18,779 --> 02:10:24,779
two hundred. That's two hundred times. That's a lot. That's two hundred, eight, four to one,

469
02:10:24,779 --> 02:10:47,449
eight to one. Look at that. That bet is over the table. Oh, you don't know who I am. All right.

470
02:10:47,449 --> 02:11:02,069
A thousand on red. Go. Where's Adam West? He's going to show up. You need to do story mode.

471
02:11:02,069 --> 02:11:21,670
Story mode is the other disc. Winner. What? Golden Nugget features a mystery themed story mode.

472
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:27,670
What? This is disc one. Wait, are you serious? How do I do that? I want to do that right now.

473
02:11:36,010 --> 02:11:46,199
There's another disc here. I want to play the mystery mode. Start a new file and select mystery

474
02:11:46,199 --> 02:12:01,800
mode. You didn't even say that. There's a murder mystery or something. I need to do it. We have

475
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:19,420
that. We have to do this. Where's the lobby? No, I don't want to play crap. PlayStation version

476
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:27,539
was released on two separate discs with one containing the game story mode. So maybe maybe

477
02:12:27,539 --> 02:12:38,649
that's accurate. Maybe it is on the other disc. OK, let's try that. Registration new. Let's see

478
02:12:38,649 --> 02:12:48,699
if it does it here. Did you get a coupon in here? I don't think so. New. Oh, cause chaos

479
02:12:48,699 --> 02:13:02,619
mystery. Chaos mystery mode. Are you kidding me? This is chaos mode. Let's go. This is it.

480
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:19,449
Chaos theory and you.

481
02:13:39,579 --> 02:13:46,619
We see the formation of a cloud, the clustering of stars. Mountains aren't cones.

482
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:54,060
Clouds aren't spheres. The world is made of zigs and zags, random,

483
02:13:54,060 --> 02:14:04,649
radical yet deep inside the chaos looks an even eerier order. And the key to this world exists.

484
02:14:05,609 --> 02:14:13,500
Now the chaos chip, the chaos chip proper interface. This new microprocessor will

485
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:23,560
compute outcomes using data compiled sheerly from nature's weather patterns, life expectancy.

486
02:14:25,159 --> 02:14:35,189
What role of a die turn? We could just play cards to, you know, what happened?

487
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:39,850
Well, at best guess, I'd say this computer your company makes has a bit of a bad motivator.

488
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:45,689
No big words, but they'll fund you. I'm sure they will after the card tricks.

489
02:14:47,449 --> 02:14:51,449
He exposed tomorrow. It's not like I have time to predict the presidential election.

490
02:14:52,649 --> 02:14:58,729
Maybe try walking on hot coals. That was last year. Not gonna answer the door. Somebody's

491
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:05,210
at the door, sweetie. Can I see any few? You expecting company? I haven't spoken to Steven

492
02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:08,810
in six years. I had no idea he was going to be here at the same time.

493
02:15:12,489 --> 02:15:18,140
You know, that's him at your little poker rondeley tomorrow. Won't you?

494
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:44,810
It's an invitational. First off, chaos indeed. Chaos. What is up? Oh, Dr. Harkness, I presume

495
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:55,609
shock or quick movements, please. Just the chip now. Chip the chaos one, the one you designed its

496
02:15:55,609 --> 02:16:07,449
location. Who are you? Call me Shirako, but quietly. We don't want to wake the neighbors. Get it. I

497
02:16:07,449 --> 02:16:34,899
actually don't. Get him to him. Where is it? I thought I hit her right in the head. I thought

498
02:16:34,899 --> 02:16:42,420
I hit her directly in the head. It was like, holy shit. What is this? This is just a spray painted

499
02:16:42,420 --> 02:17:06,420
shoe box. He's gone. So where is the mystery chip? I have a theory. I'll tell you in a minute. Steven,

500
02:17:06,979 --> 02:17:13,159
it's me. Look, don't say anything. I know that it's been forever and we didn't part on the

501
02:17:13,159 --> 02:17:20,680
greatest of terms, but I need your help. I'm in a real mess. I'm here to write the golden nugget.

502
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:29,319
I hope your poker skills are intact. Just listen, I don't have much time. Someone stole something

503
02:17:29,319 --> 02:17:34,579
very important from my hotel room. It's a microchip. It's a processor that.

504
02:17:35,379 --> 02:17:40,260
Trust me. I puke up cards. Am I like a monster like person? Why am I puke? Why am I throwing

505
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:45,379
a card? They left something behind in my hotel room. It's a registration form for the poker

506
02:17:45,379 --> 02:17:52,020
tournament. So writing on the back, I can't quite make out. Anyway, whoever it is might still play.

507
02:17:52,020 --> 02:18:00,250
And if you could just, I don't know. Don't leave it there. Ben's around here somewhere.

508
02:18:01,479 --> 02:18:06,309
Maybe you could find my friend, Melanie. Why can't you just give it to me? Sorry, I'm still so high

509
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:33,129
maintenance, Stevie. I'll talk to you when I can. Okay. Sexy scientist super invention stolen. But

510
02:18:33,209 --> 02:18:43,540
wait, wait, wait, you will need to have $20,000 to enter the poker team. Why does that headline

511
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:54,709
have to say sexy? That's bizarre. What the fuck is the point of that? Okay. I have a theory.

512
02:18:54,709 --> 02:19:02,840
The theory that I have is that the golden nugget, I mean, these casinos rake in billions.

513
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:06,680
And I'm imagining that they probably had a hundred million dollar budget for this game.

514
02:19:07,739 --> 02:19:13,500
And the developers and coders were like, okay, we made Blackjack, we made Keno, and we did poker,

515
02:19:14,059 --> 02:19:18,629
or we're done. What do you mean you're done? Yeah, we're done. We finished the game. It's just like

516
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:23,209
Blackjack and shit. There's like a million of these apps. There are 100 million of these on the app

517
02:19:23,209 --> 02:19:29,059
store on disk. There's so many of them. Oh, well, just take the other 98 million and make a movie

518
02:19:29,059 --> 02:19:38,739
with Adam West. Why? That sounds like a bad idea. Just do it. Do it. Just spend the other like 75

519
02:19:38,739 --> 02:19:46,360
million. It's just that. All right. I'm in. I'm in long term, by the way. I need $20,000.

520
02:19:47,909 --> 02:19:55,209
Got to make this happen. The apps are in the nineties. All right. We got to get to 20K. How

521
02:19:55,209 --> 02:20:11,399
much do I have right now? I have 10,000. We need to go register. I need to save the game. All right.

522
02:20:11,399 --> 02:20:25,750
Save it right there. I'm ready. SpongeBob music. Go 10K. Put it all on black. All right. Let's see

523
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:36,620
if I can do it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me go to Blackjack. Come on. All right.

524
02:20:40,010 --> 02:20:46,729
I know I don't want to do a $5 bet. No, I want to do more than that. Hit stand.

525
02:20:47,530 --> 02:20:57,020
Not up. Hey, we're good. Hit me. Hit. I'm busted. I would have won that too.

526
02:20:57,979 --> 02:21:10,040
I actually annoying. All right. How about 2252? How about 500 per hand? You guys are okay with

527
02:21:10,040 --> 02:21:22,760
that? 500 per hand. I lost 500. That's, that's a terrible start. Stand versus four. Stand. Stand.

528
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:42,950
17 versus the king. I hate this. I don't want to. I don't, I hate hitting this. I don't want to hit

529
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:53,319
this. Stand on 13 versus four. Yeah. Sometimes I have to do it. 21. Oh my God. Hit me. I'm busted.

530
02:21:54,040 --> 02:22:08,659
We're good. What is making that sound? You hear that? Okay. We got to go for it.

531
02:22:08,659 --> 02:22:23,370
Thousand. Can we, this person gets Blackjack. Hit. Can we switch seats? Stand. Shit. A 16.

02:22:27,340 --> 02:23:01,780
You're over Blackjack. Hit me. 15 versus nine. This sucks. You're over. Fuck you. Come on. Stand.

533
02:23:03,159 --> 02:23:13,909

534
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:26,729
There it is. Hit. Hit me. Hit me. I'm busted. Dude, what are you doing? Hit me. Stand.

535
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:32,790
Let's take a Blackjack. All right. We're up. We're up. 500.

536
02:23:33,350 --> 02:23:42,579
Okay. We're on a streak. Let's go. Can I split? Stand. Can I split? Do you wish to split?

537
02:23:43,379 --> 02:23:50,360
Against a nine. That's a terrible idea. Should I do it? Or split? Split eights every time. No. No.

538
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:56,860
No. It's terrible. It's horrible. It's a terrible idea. Versus a nine. You're trying to lose twice?

539
02:23:57,819 --> 02:24:03,899
Always split. Are you trying to lose twice? Always split eights. You're trying to lose twice?

540
02:24:08,059 --> 02:24:36,100
That's fucking awful. Hit it again. No. Hit me. I'm busted. Hey, guy. Hey, you know what I say.

541
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:48,469
Always split eights. Always split eights. See, that's what I say. All right. One more and I'm out.

542
02:24:52,540 --> 02:25:02,760
Stand. Get out of here. Hit me. Stand. Oh, sorry. Somebody busted. And that's now I'm at.

543
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:25,799
I'm getting close to 13K. 13K. I want to. Should I stay? It's a hot table. Hit. Stand. It's versus

544
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:29,799
seven, but I'm going for the double. Let's go. This is double down right here. 11. Let's go.

545
02:25:29,799 --> 02:25:41,620
Give me a 10. Stand. Yes. I had to count for a second. There it is. Come on. 15. We're almost

546
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:45,909
there. You're addicted. I'm not addicted. I'm playing the story mode. I have to figure out

547
02:25:45,909 --> 02:26:03,659
what the chaos chip is and I need 20,000 for it. Stand. Good. Hit. Stand. Yes. All right. I have

548
02:26:03,659 --> 02:26:17,909
to be close. I'm at 16. I'm getting up. I'm getting up. That's a $6,500 profit right now.

549
02:26:17,909 --> 02:26:29,190
All right. Now don't lose it. Roulette. No, maybe sit down and back her up. You need to be a VIP

550
02:26:29,190 --> 02:26:37,590
club member before you can visit a high limit area. You have at least $50,000. What? No,

551
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:45,129
maybe play back her up. Go save it. How do you even play Kino? I don't know how you play.

552
02:26:50,729 --> 02:27:13,670
Big six. Save the game. I will after this. What is this? How do you play big six? Put it on 10?

553
02:27:14,549 --> 02:27:25,270
No more bets. What is this? Oh, it's the big, it's the scam wheel.

554
02:27:26,389 --> 02:27:40,950
Yeah, that's the worst thing to play in the whole casino. All right. I need to go to the lobby. I

555
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:58,010
got to save it. We're so close. Where's the lobby? All right. Save the game. We're good. 15, nine.

556
02:28:00,809 --> 02:28:10,489
Okay. I need 20 K and then after 20, yeah, you need 20 K to enter the first poker tournament.

557
02:28:10,489 --> 02:28:15,340
I don't, I don't, I'm not good at poker. I like to play it sometimes.

558
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:21,000
Dude, this game came out on the app store and I'm not even kidding. It's so awesome.

559
02:28:21,879 --> 02:28:26,040
Uh, what's it called? I'm, I'm seriously go get it right now. If you think like

560
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:34,809
poker is fun, it's a poker slash Yahtzee combo. It's Yahtzee, but poker and you deal your own

561
02:28:34,809 --> 02:28:39,450
hands and you got to make this the it's like Yahtzee. It's really cool. It's what is it called?

562
02:28:40,090 --> 02:28:48,790
What's it called? It's called, um, what's it called? It's what is it called? It's called, um,

563
02:28:51,739 --> 02:28:54,459
no, it literally just came out like the other day. What's it called? Um,

564
02:28:55,340 --> 02:29:05,209
poker. It's called something. It's got a name. It's like a pit or something like something pit.

565
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:26,149
It's called, what's it called? Oh, I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it right now. I'll get it

02:29:26,149 --> 02:29:37,370
right now. What's it called? It's called something. I got it. I got it. The game is called. I got it.

567
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:59,579

568
02:29:59,579 --> 02:30:12,700
Yeah. Pizza. What the fuck? Hold on. I'm just going to yell the number. I'm going to mute.

569
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:39,180
I'm going to yell the number. Can you hear me? My, I think my iPad might be in the. All right.

570
02:30:39,180 --> 02:31:17,750
What's the name of the game? What's it called? You can't close. Okay. It's called

571
02:31:18,629 --> 02:31:25,639
pine tar is the name of the game. Pine tar. It's fucking awesome. The name of the game is pine

572
02:31:25,639 --> 02:31:47,819
tar. It's sick. Oh, pine tar. And the game is phenomenal by the way. You're sick. Oh, stop it.

573
02:31:47,819 --> 02:32:02,940
Okay. Let's go. Wait, where am I? All right. Pine tar. The game's like three or four bucks.

574
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:07,670
It's addicting. It's fun. It's just like a solo, just poker game. You play with your,

575
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:13,899
you play with yourself and it's like Yahtzee. It's like four bucks. That's it. All right. Let's go.

576
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:29,299
Roulette. The audio is fucked up. Spell it like pine tar. P I N E space T A R pine tar.

577
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:42,709
All right. We're going to go, uh, here's the strategy. We're going 500, 500. What do you think?

578
02:32:42,709 --> 02:32:50,389
I think I'm going like in here, 20, like in here and then right here, thousand bucks, 22,

579
02:32:50,389 --> 02:32:54,069
three, 25 right in this area here. Eight to one, by the way, if you hit any of these.

580
02:32:55,030 --> 02:33:22,899
No more bets, please. What is it? Winner. Yes. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. I'm almost there.

581
02:33:22,899 --> 02:33:28,840
That's eight to one. I only need to win one more time. I'm going to do 500 on black.

582
02:33:29,559 --> 02:33:44,059
I just need 500 and like 25 on black. This is it. Go. That was a huge win by the way.

583
02:33:44,059 --> 02:33:50,100
No more bets, please. Pine tar is just poker. It's poker and Yahtzee combined.

584
02:33:50,180 --> 02:34:10,299
You didn't even download it. You didn't even download it. Nine red shit. All right. Come on.

585
02:34:10,299 --> 02:34:16,620
These are easy bets. No more bets, please. Thousand on black. Come on. It's not a scam.

586
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:25,739
No, the game's actually fucking relaxing and awesome. Did I win? Yes. Winner. 20 black. Okay.

587
02:34:26,379 --> 02:34:36,389
What do I need now? All right. I just need a hundred bucks. A hundred on. We'll go red.

588
02:34:37,110 --> 02:34:48,620
100 on red before. No more bets, please. You're one of those four reviews. If you just played it,

589
02:34:48,620 --> 02:35:27,239
you would enjoy it. 29 black. Red. No more bets, please. 13 black. No more bets, please. Red.

590
02:35:34,489 --> 02:35:59,260
What the fuck? Black again. 28 black. Red. No more bets, please. Red. Let's go. Winner. 23

591
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:05,540
red. All right. I have. You've made it into the first poker tournament. There's no time to waste.

592
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:18,299
So hurry to the poker suite before they start without you. Let's go. Welcome Mr. Kills Bird.

593
02:36:18,299 --> 02:36:25,879
I'm glad you could make it. My dear sir, there simply are no vacancies. I find no record of

594
02:36:25,879 --> 02:36:32,920
your reservation whatsoever. Look, I'll pay you anything reasonable. Come on. What do you say?

595
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:37,239
Is this the poker room? Look, may as well let the white shirt in. Do Shelley's late anyway.

596
02:36:37,239 --> 02:36:44,120
Give him Henry's spot. Too late. It's already mine. If I may be of assistance,

597
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:56,569
Mr. Swain. Mr. Farland may have my seat for the first just. It seems I have business elsewhere.

598
02:36:56,569 --> 02:37:04,180
There you go. Well, well. Who are we? Kills Bird. Shelley's told me so much about you. My name's

599
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:10,579
Swain, but anybody who knows me from Adam calls me Hugh. I gathered from your body language that

600
02:37:10,579 --> 02:37:17,139
you're a left-handed card player. A little disconcerting since I see that you've neglected

601
02:37:17,139 --> 02:37:23,940
the laces on your right shoe. A stress level that could only be related to the jitters before

602
02:37:25,059 --> 02:37:31,459
a high stakes game of chance or to the comments I overheard this morning from a young woman

603
02:37:31,459 --> 02:37:37,299
at the pay phones downstairs since she called her speaker, Stevie. This is fucking awesome.

604
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:50,500
It can only be assumed that you're he and here for her. Or one of us has become vaguely confused.

605
02:37:52,069 --> 02:37:57,930
Though my suspicions perhaps sound deranged to the common ear, I think there's more to this

606
02:37:57,930 --> 02:38:04,090
friendly game of chance than meets the eye. You keep that eye on your opponents. Mr. Garth's not

607
02:38:04,090 --> 02:38:11,180
lit. I'll be in touch. It's your turn at that. Mr. Mr. Slane, I'm just the pizza guy.

608
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:15,500
Can you sign for this or? I don't know what you're talking about.

609
02:38:17,059 --> 02:38:21,860
Gentlemen, ladies, welcome to the Golden Nugget and this year's preliminary poker

610
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:26,579
invitational. Beginning on my right, please state the names by which you wish to be known.

611
02:38:27,219 --> 02:38:32,899
I'm Joanna Kurtz. Hello, everyone. Ben Farland. Great to be surrounded by all of you,

612
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:40,020
especially the famous Mr. Kilzberg, who needs no introduction. You're a weird guy. Mr. Farland,

613
02:38:40,659 --> 02:38:45,459
Mr. Kilzberg, welcome. Wait, we can't introduce ourselves? Short for Tracy.

614
02:38:46,180 --> 02:38:54,180
Serako, if anything. Sheila Warwick. Call me whatever you like, within reason. Thank you all.

615
02:38:55,479 --> 02:39:02,659
Let's get started. All right, here we go. I can't fuck this up. This is a big poker tournament.

616
02:39:02,979 --> 02:39:16,459
Oh, this is not high. What? Oh, everybody, it's time for the billionaires to play with $25 a hand.

617
02:39:16,459 --> 02:39:37,000
What the fuck is this? How do you play poker? What kind of poker is this? I don't know what

618
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,120
we're playing. What kind of poker is this? What's that mean? I raise. I don't know what's going on.

619
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:49,350
I call. I'm out. I don't know what's happening. You may vote, call or raise. I got queen high.

620
02:39:50,229 --> 02:39:53,909
What kind of poker is this? Is it Texas Hold'em? Five card draw?

621
02:39:54,870 --> 02:40:03,559
Because I mean queen high, that's pretty good, right? I will raise. I call. I'm out. I call.

622
02:40:03,559 --> 02:40:18,520
I call. I call. Can we see other cards? Okay, so now what? I check. You may check or bet. I

623
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:25,479
don't know what that means. This is a pretty good hand. It's a pretty good hand. It's five

624
02:40:25,479 --> 02:40:36,420
card stud. Okay. I got queen ten suited. Pretty good. Check. I bet. I call. I call. I call. I raise.

625
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:46,170
You may vote, call or raise. I call. I call. I call. I call. You got a pair of sevens?

626
02:40:46,170 --> 02:40:55,959
It has nothing to do with my fucking royal flush. You may vote, call or raise. I need a queen under

627
02:40:55,959 --> 02:41:15,370
there. I need a queen under here, right? I raise. I raise. I call. I call. You may vote,

628
02:41:15,370 --> 02:41:29,959
call or raise. I call. I'm gonna have a queen under here. Whip him. Whip him. You may vote,

629
02:41:29,959 --> 02:41:36,729
call or raise. Why so many cards? One, two, three, four, five. I have six cards now.

630
02:41:37,370 --> 02:41:51,159
Is it seven card stud? Uh oh. I raise. I think I got a queen under there. I call. I call. You may

631
02:41:51,159 --> 02:41:58,360
vote, call or raise. I call. I've got a queen. Flip that queen. I'm gonna flip a queen. Watch this.

632
02:41:59,750 --> 02:42:10,409
Flipping a queen. Boom. You may vote, call or raise. I raise. I raise. I call. I call. You may vote,

633
02:42:10,409 --> 02:42:20,950
call or raise. I call. Flipping a queen. I win. I'm getting too close to this guy's cards.

634
02:42:21,510 --> 02:42:37,559
What are my cards? Where are my cards? I don't get to show my cards? Where are they?

635
02:42:38,120 --> 02:42:49,270
You had nothing. You ate them. You dropped your hand on the ground.

636
02:42:52,069 --> 02:43:07,559
Deal. I guess I lost but I didn't even see what I had for a hand. Okay. I'm out. Already?

637
02:43:08,649 --> 02:43:13,930
I raise. I'm out. Why? You can't even see what you have. You have a queen high. I'm out. What are

638
02:43:13,930 --> 02:43:20,950
they doing? You may vote, call or raise. It's just me and the guy with the king. Let's go. Raise. I call.

639
02:43:20,950 --> 02:43:34,760
I call. I call. Give me a jack. Oh. I check. Okay. I check. Not bad. You may check or bet.

640
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:43,239
Let's check. I check. All right. Now we raise. Now we raise. I raise. Come on. I raise. You got it.

641
02:43:43,239 --> 02:43:59,190
I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. All I care about is the two queens. I raise. I raise.

642
02:43:59,270 --> 02:44:11,579
I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. All right. Is that? You may check or bet.

I raise. I raise. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. I call. I call. We got...

644
02:44:27,639 --> 02:44:52,170
What do I have? Two queens. I'm out. You fucking have aces under there. What? I want to go see

645
02:44:52,170 --> 02:45:02,090
Adam West again. I call. I'm out. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I mean everybody kind of

646
02:45:02,090 --> 02:45:21,100
has a shitty hand so I might as well. I call. I'm out. I call. I call. I check. I check. You would.

647
02:45:21,739 --> 02:45:36,120
You may check or bet. The hearts. I check. I can't believe we're doing $25 hand. You may vote,

648
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:42,700
call or raise. This is awful. What? I mean five, six, seven. I could. I raise. You could get a

649
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:57,770
straight call. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. You may vote, call or raise.

650
02:45:58,409 --> 02:46:10,010
God, look at this bullshit. You sure you can't look at the flipped cards?

651
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:22,500
I don't think so. I think that's how this works. I call. I call. I'm out. You may vote, call or

652
02:46:22,500 --> 02:46:30,340
raise. I raise. I call. I call. I raise. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. I raise every

653
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:45,190
time. I call. I call. I call. I call. Eventually. Will I liquidate myself? Ooh. I check. All right.

654
02:46:45,989 --> 02:46:52,540
I check. We got Queen Jack. I check. Not suited. I check. It's all right. You may check or bet.

655
02:46:52,540 --> 02:47:00,299
I call. I raise. I raise. I call. I call. You may vote, call or raise. I call. I call.

656
02:47:02,659 --> 02:47:07,780
Look, it's kind of quiet. Look over, like Adam West just sleeping on that couch.

657
02:47:10,340 --> 02:47:15,059
Yeah, he had all that shit to say and he's kind of taking a nap. I raise. I raise. You may vote,

658
02:47:15,059 --> 02:47:26,469
call or raise. Well, the King Queen Jack, that's, I can't beat that. What the fuck is that? I call.

659
02:47:26,469 --> 02:47:44,149
I call. I call. I call. I call. How long do you sit here for to do this? I raise. I raise. I call.

660
02:47:44,149 --> 02:47:51,290
I call. I have Jack, Queen, 10. Is that a 9? Dude, I'm close. Is that a 6? No, it's a, wait, shit.

661
02:47:51,290 --> 02:48:05,459
Is that a 9 or is it a 6? I call. I call. I call. I call. I call. Let's go. Come on. Let me,

662
02:48:05,459 --> 02:48:18,379
let me get this big pot here to nine, nine, 10, come on. Give me straight. I raise. I raise. I call.

663
02:48:18,379 --> 02:48:25,020
I call. I call. You have one pair. You may vote, call, or raise. I call. I call. I call. I call.

664
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:28,409
This is a big pot. Give it to me.

665
02:48:28,409 --> 02:48:30,780
Give me the straight.

666
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:33,379
Do it. Come on.

667
02:48:33,379 --> 02:48:35,819
I'm out.

668
02:48:35,819 --> 02:48:37,819
Five, six, what is it?

669
02:48:37,819 --> 02:48:40,760
I'm out. What do I have?

670
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:44,219
I'm out.

671
02:48:44,219 --> 02:48:48,760
Did I win?

672
02:48:48,760 --> 02:48:50,760
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a brief intermission.

673
02:48:50,760 --> 02:49:01,959
Did I win?

674
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:06,100
Excuse me.

675
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:08,100
It would seem the waters run deeper than I feared.

676
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,100
Perhaps I should elaborate in our last conversation.

677
02:49:10,100 --> 02:49:12,100
No doubt you found it

678
02:49:12,100 --> 02:49:14,469
Puzzling.

679
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:16,469
You see, I was unwinding at the tables earlier.

680
02:49:16,469 --> 02:49:18,469
His cigar is bigger.

681
02:49:18,469 --> 02:49:20,469
His cigar grows when he tells a lie.

682
02:49:20,469 --> 02:49:22,469
As always, when in a large room

683
02:49:22,469 --> 02:49:24,469
filled with a symphony of hundreds of people

684
02:49:24,469 --> 02:49:26,469
engaged in hypnotic entertainment,

685
02:49:26,469 --> 02:49:28,469
I found myself lip reading.

686
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:30,780
Immediately I recognized

687
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:32,780
the renowned chaos theorist

688
02:49:32,780 --> 02:49:34,780
from today's front page.

689
02:49:34,780 --> 02:49:36,780
Yet though wracked with guilt

690
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:38,780
for my invasion of her privacy,

691
02:49:38,780 --> 02:49:40,780
I soon noticed I wasn't the only one

692
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:42,780
paying attention to a beautiful celebrity

693
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:44,780
on the verge of collapse.

694
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:53,290
Ed, Edd and Eddie?

695
02:49:53,290 --> 02:49:55,290
It's Ed, Edd and Eddie music.

696
02:49:55,290 --> 02:50:06,170
Until that moment,

697
02:50:06,170 --> 02:50:08,170
my main reason for visiting the Golden Nugget

698
02:50:08,170 --> 02:50:10,170
had been the hope of winning enough to...

699
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:12,170
Well, let's just say I drive a guzzler

700
02:50:12,170 --> 02:50:14,170
and have a charming collection of pads.

701
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:18,170
But suddenly I knew a storm was gathering

702
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:20,790
and this scrap of paper

703
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:22,790
began to look like the

704
02:50:22,790 --> 02:50:25,219
only umbrella

705
02:50:25,219 --> 02:50:27,459
of the entire western state

706
02:50:27,459 --> 02:50:30,219
since we last spoke.

707
02:50:30,219 --> 02:50:33,350
I examined this

708
02:50:33,350 --> 02:50:35,350
telltale tatter using

709
02:50:35,350 --> 02:50:37,350
what few items in my crime lab

710
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:39,350
I had time to pack in my duct tape.

711
02:50:39,350 --> 02:50:41,350
Although encrypted

712
02:50:41,350 --> 02:50:43,350
in pig latin,

713
02:50:43,350 --> 02:50:45,590
I deciphered this curious phrase

714
02:50:45,590 --> 02:50:47,590
written on the back in fresh black ink.

715
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:49,590
Why was six

716
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:51,590
afraid of seven?

717
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:53,590
Signed, bullets over kings.

718
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:55,590
He's making stuff.

719
02:50:55,590 --> 02:50:57,590
I'll run this through the computer, you keep an eye out here.

720
02:50:57,590 --> 02:50:59,590
The fiend who taunts us with these

721
02:50:59,590 --> 02:51:01,590
dastardly rib ticklers.

722
02:51:01,590 --> 02:51:03,590
This guy's a weirdo.

723
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:05,590
That's a CVS receipt for one coconut water.

724
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:09,590
Keep them clueless, casually.

725
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:11,959
No, save your questions

726
02:51:11,959 --> 02:51:13,959
till later. I'm in motion.

727
02:51:13,959 --> 02:51:21,770
Can we get you anything,

728
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:23,770
Mr. Kilzberg?

729
02:51:23,770 --> 02:51:26,069
Yes. I would like.

730
02:51:26,069 --> 02:51:28,069
Wasn't Mr. Swain with you

731
02:51:28,069 --> 02:51:30,069
a moment ago?

732
02:51:30,069 --> 02:51:38,260
No, no, it was a different guy.

733
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:40,260
That was a different guy.

734
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:42,260
Alright, here we go. I gotta keep this going.

735
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:47,959
I gotta keep it going. I can't just go to zero.

736
02:51:47,959 --> 02:51:57,879
We gotta see how this plays out.

737
02:51:57,879 --> 02:51:59,879
You may vote, call, or raise.

738
02:51:59,879 --> 02:52:06,659
Hmm.

739
02:52:06,659 --> 02:52:08,659
Yeah, two jacks, two eights, two pair, no way.

740
02:52:08,659 --> 02:52:11,670
I would've lost.

741
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:15,639
Resident sleeper gameplay.

742
02:52:15,639 --> 02:52:21,270
Get back to the cut scene.

743
02:52:21,270 --> 02:52:23,270
I raise. I call.

744
02:52:23,270 --> 02:52:25,270
Everybody's got good shit to start.

745
02:52:25,270 --> 02:52:27,270
I call.

746
02:52:27,270 --> 02:52:29,899
I'm out.

747
02:52:29,899 --> 02:52:31,899
Ask for the beer plus milk.

748
02:52:31,899 --> 02:52:35,860
I call.

749
02:52:35,860 --> 02:52:37,860
It's been six hours. It hadn't even been three.

750
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:43,299
Alright.

751
02:52:43,299 --> 02:52:45,299
I check.

752
02:52:45,299 --> 02:52:47,479
You may check or bet.

753
02:52:47,479 --> 02:52:49,479
Uh, whatever.

754
02:52:49,479 --> 02:52:51,479
I call.

755
02:52:51,479 --> 02:52:53,479
I raise.

756
02:52:53,479 --> 02:52:55,479
Just watch the cut scenes on YouTube.

757
02:52:55,479 --> 02:52:57,479
No, I need to earn it.

758
02:52:57,479 --> 02:53:00,299
I call.

759
02:53:00,299 --> 02:53:02,299
I call.

760
02:53:02,299 --> 02:53:12,860
That's not bad.

761
02:53:12,860 --> 02:53:14,860
You may vote, call, or raise.

762
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:16,860
I call.

763
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:18,860
I call.

764
02:53:18,860 --> 02:53:21,100
Please, we want to see Spyro.

765
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:23,100
What makes you think I have Spyro here right now?

766
02:53:23,100 --> 02:53:28,090
I don't have Spyro.

767
02:53:28,090 --> 02:53:30,090
I raise.

768
02:53:30,090 --> 02:53:32,090
You may vote, call, or raise.

769
02:53:32,090 --> 02:53:34,090
I call.

770
02:53:34,090 --> 02:53:36,389
I call.

771
02:53:36,389 --> 02:53:38,389
I think I played Spyro already.

772
02:53:38,389 --> 02:53:45,739
A long time ago.

773
02:53:45,739 --> 02:53:47,739
I raise.

774
02:53:47,739 --> 02:53:49,739
You may vote, call, or raise.

775
02:53:49,739 --> 02:53:51,739
I call.

776
02:53:51,739 --> 02:53:53,739
Just cancel the stream. There's no Spyro.

777
02:53:53,739 --> 02:53:58,010
Alright, flip it.

778
02:53:58,010 --> 02:54:00,010
I'm out.

779
02:54:00,010 --> 02:54:02,010
I'm out.

780
02:54:02,010 --> 02:54:04,010
I'm out.

781
02:54:04,010 --> 02:54:06,010
I'm out.

782
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:09,270
I'm out.

783
02:54:09,270 --> 02:54:17,399
You better play Bionicle.

784
02:54:17,399 --> 02:54:19,399
We're not in a rush.

785
02:54:19,399 --> 02:54:21,399
You may vote, call, or raise.

786
02:54:21,399 --> 02:54:24,409
We're not in a rush.

787
02:54:24,409 --> 02:54:26,409
I call.

788
02:54:26,409 --> 02:54:30,120
I'm out.

789
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,700
I raise.

790
02:54:33,700 --> 02:54:35,700
I call.

791
02:54:35,700 --> 02:54:37,700
I call.

792
02:54:37,700 --> 02:54:39,879
I call.

793
02:54:39,879 --> 02:54:41,879
I got surgery in an hour, dude.

794
02:54:41,879 --> 02:54:43,879
Are you talking from the hospital bed?

795
02:54:43,879 --> 02:54:46,120
What do you mean?

796
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:48,420
I have knee surgery in an hour, dude.

797
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:50,420
Go get prepped for surgery.

798
02:54:50,420 --> 02:54:52,420
What are you doing here?

799
02:54:52,420 --> 02:54:54,729
What are you talking about?

800
02:54:54,729 --> 02:54:56,729
Are you lying down in the hospital bed?

801
02:54:56,729 --> 02:54:59,540
That's a great hand, by the way.

802
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:01,540
I raise.

803
02:55:01,540 --> 02:55:03,540
I call.

804
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:05,540
You may vote, call, or raise.

805
02:55:05,540 --> 02:55:07,540
I call.

806
02:55:07,540 --> 02:55:13,559
I call.

807
02:55:13,559 --> 02:55:18,540
He is the surgeon.

808
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:20,540
I raise.

809
02:55:20,540 --> 02:55:22,540
You may vote, call, or raise.

810
02:55:22,540 --> 02:55:24,540
I call.

811
02:55:24,540 --> 02:55:34,780
He's postponing the surgery.

812
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:36,780
I check.

813
02:55:36,780 --> 02:55:38,780
Ace, jack, queen, king.

814
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:40,780
I raise.

815
02:55:40,780 --> 02:55:42,780
Call, or raise.

816
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:44,780
I call.

817
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:46,780
I call.

818
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:53,180
I call.

819
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:55,180
I call.

820
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:57,420
I raise.

821
02:55:57,420 --> 02:55:59,719
I raise.

822
02:55:59,719 --> 02:56:01,719
You may vote, call, or raise.

He's in town to unveil his new Adam's smash for tomorrow's expo

833
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:21,479
Personally, I've never understood any of the stuff his company makes

834
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Ram wrong

835
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:28,200
It's all geek to me. So he gave me a little pocket change

836
02:57:28,200 --> 02:57:30,200
And

837
02:57:30,840 --> 02:57:32,840

That

843
02:57:57,420 --> 02:57:59,420
Girl's father used to work for me

844
02:58:00,059 --> 02:58:05,739
But the cool thing about the backstab is you only need that one good

845
02:58:06,020 --> 02:58:15,659
You didn't save her spot and it's open and now Max Chilton owns my old company and I'm Girl Friday for an obnoxious

954
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:13,690

03:12:29,879 --> 03:12:46,680
Just not fit this game. This doesn't fit the game at all

958
03:12:47,040 --> 03:13:00,440
This feels like back in YouTube when something got DMCA content ID and a default regular ass YouTube song had to be played over

959
03:13:00,440 --> 03:13:01,600

03:18:09,739 --> 03:18:34,659
Nothing on this earth. How do I get out of here get up the stairs? Oh

980
03:18:41,959 --> 03:18:50,379
God, okay, that security card died. Wait, is it wait the beginning?

981
03:18:59,780 --> 03:19:07,180
Like I made it

982
03:19:15,290 --> 03:19:29,559
Am I remembering what he said, okay or some white water on them

983
03:19:32,319 --> 03:19:40,409
What do you want me to I didn't even have a second

984
03:19:48,389 --> 03:20:24,790
Yeah, where's my menu about to pull it out of the drink

985
03:20:55,489 --> 03:20:59,309
No, I don't wait, it's alright, it's okay. I don't wanna go one more

986
03:21:02,149 --> 03:21:06,030
Okay, so I I'm sorry and I'm gonna make a lot of people really upset about this probably

987
03:21:06,549 --> 03:21:11,329
You're probably gonna be like dude. What the fuck fuck you right? But just let me this is my opinion about video games

988
03:21:11,350 --> 03:21:17,030
This is my personal video game opinion. And all I have to say is I don't like the old Resident Evil games

989
03:21:17,030 --> 03:21:22,819
I think they're awful and I thought that when they came out as they came out during a period where I that was like a new

990
03:21:22,819 --> 03:21:23,860
thing

991
03:21:23,860 --> 03:21:27,409
Like when the Resident Evil games were a big deal

992
03:21:27,610 --> 03:21:32,170
They were just barely releasing and I was part of that group that thought

993
03:21:32,930 --> 03:21:42,350
And I do I did not like them and those are like the best of the best in this genre of tank controlled games

994
03:21:42,389 --> 03:21:46,030
I don't think I'm gonna like this one very much at all

995
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:57,350
Resident Evil 4 is this does not count. I'm talking about Resident Evil 1 Resident Evil 2

996
03:21:57,829 --> 03:22:02,469
Although I did I did enjoy them. I did play them. I did

997
03:22:03,030 --> 03:22:05,870
Eventually, but I never was a fan of the

998
03:22:07,430 --> 03:22:09,930
Okay, let me figure that I'm gonna figure this out

999
03:22:10,170 --> 03:22:16,809
That's a zoomer opinion. No, it's not. I just don't like tank control games. It's driving crazy

1000
03:22:17,170 --> 03:22:23,059
All right anesthetic stun gun and after they're on to pour some water on them and I don't do I have white water

1001
03:22:25,090 --> 03:22:27,450
stun globe anesthetic dart I

1002
03:22:28,569 --> 03:22:40,909
Don't have white weight white water is in the corner. How do I use it? How do I use them? How do I use the water?

1003
03:22:54,430 --> 03:23:31,040
How do I pour the water on them doesn't help what action

1004
03:23:32,459 --> 03:23:35,270
Change weapon

1005
03:23:35,430 --> 03:23:40,040
Wait, what's that?

1006
03:23:46,729 --> 03:23:53,899
Like how do you pour water on them?

1007
03:24:03,559 --> 03:24:41,350
Ready are you though?

1008
03:24:41,510 --> 03:24:48,360
Bionicles going in ps2 Bionicle for ps2 going in now

1009
03:24:48,360 --> 03:24:56,889
I mean that was worth playing just to get that opening cutscene. That was great

1010
03:25:01,860 --> 03:25:22,659
Eidos really

1011
03:25:22,659 --> 03:25:33,600
This looks fucking awesome

1012
03:25:33,600 --> 03:26:16,700
But her that was a very long intro take two ice the movie starting everybody quiet

1013
03:27:00,479 --> 03:27:02,479
And

1014
03:27:03,079 --> 03:27:10,680
It's transformed all the islands inhabitants into all kinds of strange spiteful creatures

1015
03:27:14,680 --> 03:27:24,469
You must track that beat the Piraka to return boy, and we to peace

1016
03:27:25,870 --> 03:27:31,030
Use the powers that the masks will grant you to say boy, and we

1017
03:27:31,030 --> 03:27:33,030
I

1018
03:27:46,350 --> 03:27:48,350
Onicle heroes, I'm ready

1019
03:27:49,309 --> 03:28:08,350
I'm prepared. It's travelers tales. They make the Lego games really this still this still kicking, huh? That's pretty cool

1020
03:28:08,590 --> 03:28:36,149
All right, I'm ready. I know a lot of people were looking forward to this. Oh the bloom is

1021
03:28:36,950 --> 03:28:39,600
unbelievable

1022
03:28:39,600 --> 03:29:03,739
The whole game is a bloom filter enter shop. Whoa, what is all this? All right, I gotta go do a mission zone select

1023
03:29:14,100 --> 03:29:24,670
There's ox coastline. I think that's the only one I can do right. Let's go. You need 3d glasses

1024
03:29:25,190 --> 03:29:38,489
It really is like the Lego games, isn't it? I could turn scan lines on it might help

1025
03:29:43,389 --> 03:30:05,659
That's right. I'm gonna try scan lines. See hold on. I don't want you to see my I'm not wearing any clothes

1026
03:30:06,180 --> 03:30:11,170
All right, I'm gonna try you tell me which one

1027
03:30:26,139 --> 03:31:04,260
Does that look better it's too dark hold on how's that it feels like I'm playing this game

1028
03:31:04,500 --> 03:31:09,620
Dream, it feels like I'm playing this game in a dream. I had not even playing it right now

1029
03:31:09,620 --> 03:31:13,129
I'm dreaming that I'm playing this

1030
03:31:14,090 --> 03:31:22,670
2006 YouTube I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna go back. I'm going back. Just hold on

1031
03:31:36,899 --> 03:31:41,760
It does look like I'm holding it in front of a TV

1032
03:31:42,360 --> 03:32:03,319
Yeah, it looks like I'm pointing a camera at the TV the brightness down. How's that? I think that looks all right

1033
03:32:03,319 --> 03:32:48,590
That's actually not that bad. Let's go. Whoa. I have a lot of money. Is there like a dash? Whoa

1034
03:32:49,209 --> 03:32:50,889
I can change character

1035
03:32:50,889 --> 03:33:04,010
All right, that's pretty sick. I got another character but bloom on your webcam

1036
03:33:05,049 --> 03:33:13,600
This is a quo. I think it has killed that

1037
03:33:14,299 --> 03:33:19,860
cool

1038
03:33:19,860 --> 03:33:23,000
This game is actually really good

1039
03:33:23,440 --> 03:33:28,739
But bloom on you. I don't think I know I can't I don't know how to do that

1040
03:33:40,829 --> 03:33:51,260
5,000 another character

1041
03:33:51,459 --> 03:33:53,219
Was this person do?

1042
03:33:53,219 --> 03:33:57,739
grenades I could see how this would this would be

1043
03:33:58,420 --> 03:34:00,100
absolutely phenomenal

1044
03:34:00,100 --> 03:34:05,409
Like this is a great game

1045
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:13,180
I have to collect them or something. Are they just worth money?

1046
03:34:16,409 --> 03:34:22,420
Bionicle series literally saved Lego from bankruptcy. It was the Holy Grail for them. It's pretty sick

1047
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:34,500
You need your green

1048
03:34:36,479 --> 03:34:40,780
Gustability here. Is it Balta? I don't have this ability

1049
03:34:41,459 --> 03:34:44,399
So I do I have to leave

1050
03:34:56,809 --> 03:34:59,559
Bionicles were dope. I

1051
03:34:59,920 --> 03:35:04,879
Bionicle kind of passed by me. They weren't quite my generation. It was just barely

1052
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:24,989
You're very old. Yeah

1053
03:35:25,190 --> 03:35:36,629
So when I feel that thing up at the top that means I've got maximum amount of money from this level

1054
03:35:37,350 --> 03:35:56,319
Hero mode increases weapon power and allows you to trigger gold

1055
03:35:57,399 --> 03:35:58,760
Constructions

1056
03:35:58,760 --> 03:36:16,059
What's that mean? What's that mean? Just go it's kind of hard though, doesn't it?

1057
03:36:43,780 --> 03:37:26,510
Was this whoa build the boat be kidding me. Holy shit, that was cool. What do I do the boat?

1058
03:37:37,840 --> 03:38:11,549
Is it on rails? I think it's on rails doesn't look that bad anymore. Looks all right be worse

1059
03:38:11,950 --> 03:38:16,579
Whoa, hold on. Holy shit. Oh

1060
03:38:20,610 --> 03:38:32,680
Open this geez, I'm gonna die. I'm dead

1061
03:38:40,459 --> 03:38:41,700
Jesus

1062
03:38:41,700 --> 03:39:42,219
I got the masks here. I'm all let's go. This game looks like the disk is rusted. It's not

1063
03:39:42,780 --> 03:39:46,809
the disc rusted dude

1064
03:39:47,290 --> 03:40:13,770
This is just what video games looks like like 20 years ago. It's still a boss over here. Oh, no, it's a mask. All right

1065
03:40:14,409 --> 03:40:34,469
I think I like this guy the best like the fire and I not I don't have that ability yet

1066
03:40:34,950 --> 03:40:51,020
Shit, I think your screen is dirty

1067
03:40:51,600 --> 03:41:12,219
Games really cool. But can we go back to Adam West? No to go back to Adam West

1068
03:41:12,219 --> 03:41:20,899
We have to play seven card stud which nobody wants to do that or seven card to whatever it is

1069
03:41:27,129 --> 03:41:33,020
I had a prompt for something. What was that?

1070
03:41:33,379 --> 03:42:07,600
Yeah, this is bionicle. I had a lot of people with that. That's a lot of money. Give me I like the building stuff

1071
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:39,079
It's fun about to go hero mode. I need health. This is literally a cooler Lego game. I mean, it's pretty cool

1072
03:42:39,079 --> 03:42:48,190
I think it's fun. I need a mask. I need a mask

1073
03:42:49,030 --> 03:42:51,049
stop

1074
03:42:51,049 --> 03:43:12,680
This dude imagine a remade remastered version of this game would be amazing

1075
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:34,799
Did they ever make one of these again or no never again? What am I doing? Oh, I can climb this

1076
03:43:35,520 --> 03:43:38,399
Never again, really?

1077
03:43:39,739 --> 03:44:20,340
Unfortunate that bounce I'm going this way and I go down there gamer Andy

1078
03:44:26,639 --> 03:44:31,489
Where is it? Where is that?

1079
03:44:31,690 --> 03:44:36,059
Stop, where's the thing?

1080
03:44:36,059 --> 03:45:03,149
Why can't I do it? Come on, do it fuck. I can't do anything with this. I actually can't do anything. I

1081
03:45:09,059 --> 03:45:11,940
Can't make it. I don't have the ability. I

1082
03:45:16,829 --> 03:45:26,360
Apparently can't do anything. You wasted the hero mode. No, I got it. Oh, okay

1083
03:45:26,559 --> 03:45:28,479
I need new abilities

1084
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:38,079
Cool. This is cool. What is I want to sweat a cool game

1085
03:45:38,219 --> 03:45:43,340
If you get this for Christmas, you know, I mean you would be absolutely thrilled

1086
03:45:43,979 --> 03:46:04,129
So I don't have that character. I can't open this

1087
03:46:04,770 --> 03:46:32,370
Looks like it's behind me. Whatever. I want to go buy stuff. Look at much money I have

1088
03:46:46,690 --> 03:47:02,420
Here mode, oh

1089
03:47:03,260 --> 03:47:04,899
I

1090
03:47:04,899 --> 03:47:12,770
Need to get here a mode. This is a boss. I

1091
03:47:13,209 --> 03:47:51,940
Gotta get around. I can't fight this guy. Wait, hold on. I need god mode or whatever it is

1092
03:47:52,459 --> 03:48:37,420
Can't how do I activate here a mode? I don't have enough activated. I I can't almost there. Oh

1093

It's alright I have money

1097
03:50:57,479 --> 03:52:05,629
Joe Biden left. I'm trying to find Joe Biden talking. What would it would it be under Joe Biden?

1098
03:52:06,389 --> 03:52:30,180
Hanging out. I don't think that exists Joe Biden voice lines. Yeah, but he's not like a fucking cartoon character

1099
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:59,930
Like a voice lines Joe Biden Joe Biden's supercut. I can't I don't I don't know what this even sounds like

1100
03:53:00,290 --> 03:53:07,799
Okay, this is not even gonna be funny like at all

1101
03:53:27,680 --> 03:53:36,829
I

1102
03:53:43,579 --> 03:53:45,579
Told you it wasn't gonna be funny

1103
03:53:50,600 --> 03:53:52,600
Sounds like he's part of the game

1104
03:53:53,200 --> 03:53:59,270
He's in the game

1105
03:53:59,270 --> 03:54:30,379
New character how many it's a lot of characters. Is it all right? So now I can upgrade and unlock items

1106
03:54:30,659 --> 03:54:37,520
This is what I care about more than anything. I don't want to go in there

1107
03:54:38,000 --> 03:54:50,379
No, how do I get out of here? There you go. How much money do I actually have the question?

1108
03:54:50,620 --> 03:54:55,350
You can now visit the creature chambers

03:54:57,079 --> 03:55:01,049
You can now visit the trophy room

1110
03:55:06,459 --> 03:55:08,059
canister locator

03:55:08,059 --> 03:55:10,489
Diving board. This is all so expensive

1112
03:55:10,969 --> 03:55:23,659

Okay. All right. All right. Now I'm excited because look at this

1118
03:57:04,620 --> 03:57:07,760
this guy's cracked out now, I

1119
03:57:28,059 --> 03:57:31,389
I would have put

1120
03:57:31,389 --> 03:57:49,459
Thousand hours into this game when I was like 12 without a doubt did that go to the ice level box mountain

1121
03:57:49,620 --> 03:58:12,590
What about sly Cooper? Um, you'll see it eventually. I got a lot of games dude. You're an adult

1122
03:58:12,590 --> 03:58:15,790
You can put ten a thousand hours into this. Yeah, but I don't want to do that

1123
03:58:25,940 --> 03:58:45,500
Making somebody did you suck? You're that upgraded torch? Oh, it's just absolutely

1124
03:58:46,139 --> 03:58:48,340
Melts people it just melts people

1125
03:58:49,180 --> 03:59:26,620
I'm not why would I switch to another hero unless I have to move something shit. I don't have that person

1126
03:59:34,129 --> 03:59:56,200
Almost psycho. There you go. There you go. Ooh

1127
04:00:02,850 --> 04:00:04,329
Can I open this?

1128
04:00:04,329 --> 04:00:29,440
Shit, I really didn't think I was gonna like this. I thought this was gonna be crap

1129
04:00:29,559 --> 04:00:36,170
So yeah, this is like this is gonna be dumb

1130
04:00:52,969 --> 04:01:11,770
Bionicle is based. Yeah, I know pretty like I'm doing here. What's this? Oh

1131
04:01:13,659 --> 04:01:33,229
We chirp build Bionicle on screen

1132
04:01:34,110 --> 04:01:53,840
Why am I dying? Why am I dying? Why am I what happened? Why am I dying? What did I do? Can't be in the water. Oh

1133
04:02:03,909 --> 04:02:08,020
That's bad, I can't walk across water now

1134
04:02:08,540 --> 04:02:33,870
Take another battery do this for six hours. Um, I'll do this for a little while

1135
04:02:34,610 --> 04:02:54,729
Yep, this is Bionicle. This is Bionicle for the PlayStation 2. Okay

1136
04:02:55,610 --> 04:03:08,180
Pop that I need to collect more of this shit. I'm out of money. I need way more money

1137
04:03:08,180 --> 04:03:35,290
I have heard of this thing so many times. It's kind of nice. I don't want to turn on the hero mode yet

1138
04:03:35,809 --> 04:03:49,649
Not yet. Ooh, what's this beat this game or watch the Bionicle movies? It's your choice

1139
04:03:50,290 --> 04:03:55,670
Well, one of those things is illegal. So I think I'll choose this for a little while

1140
04:03:56,309 --> 04:04:16,629
You both all right. I got here a boat. It seems legal

1141
04:04:17,229 --> 04:04:51,860
Alright, where's the where's the big guy? Come on. Where is he? Do it. It's been a towel rack

1142
04:04:52,379 --> 04:05:53,270
Come on. Where's the how do I make the big guy? There we go. There's a lot of people

1143
04:05:53,829 --> 04:06:33,229
Do it climb toll. It's worth a lot. The Lego games do this too. You'd have to touch everything

1144
04:06:33,750 --> 04:06:51,399
I buy it. I buy it was cool. Would you guys all leave a Bionicle stream if I made one?

1145
04:06:53,629 --> 04:07:32,139
I've never I've done I never even played with them ever never even seen him before I would leave. Okay one more money

1146
04:07:33,899 --> 04:07:36,770
Nice

1147
04:07:36,770 --> 04:07:40,799
It's so satisfying

1148
04:07:40,879 --> 04:07:46,600
This game is great. I like it a lot. It's really cool

1149
04:07:47,200 --> 04:08:10,520
Do a pole pole pole pole for what you keep playing this? Oh to make a Bionicle

1150
04:08:10,520 --> 04:08:14,879
All right, should I make a Bionicle like next week on stream?

1151
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:18,899
It has to be at least 80%

1152
04:08:48,940 --> 04:08:57,420
Gotta be a lot

1153
04:08:57,420 --> 04:09:35,190
40,000 shit. I want that. Did I get turned around? Oh my god. Okay, please

1154
04:09:36,030 --> 04:09:50,059
You guys like Bionicle and don't have it. Do you look like a Bionicle? That's

1155
04:09:50,979 --> 04:10:25,840
Incredibly handsome and I didn't see them. Well, how do I get across money?

1156
04:10:26,479 --> 04:10:28,049
money

1157
04:10:28,049 --> 04:10:49,049
You've gone go. Who wasn't here. Will you eat the Bionicle?

1158
04:10:49,489 --> 04:10:53,459
No, I will display it on my reddit shell

1159
04:11:19,959 --> 04:11:57,680
Alright, I'm kind of just like vibing out right now. This is fun. Build it praying mantis. Oh

1160
04:12:04,139 --> 04:12:08,100
It's cutting the alright. I'll finish the job. Come on

1161
04:12:08,739 --> 04:12:12,920
Finish the job. Where'd you go? Oh

1162
04:12:37,719 --> 04:13:36,700
Boy, that's a lot. I'm hurt really bad. Come on do it. No, I don't want to lose that guy

1163
04:13:37,260 --> 04:14:06,360
That should be it, right? Do it. Come on punk

1164
04:14:27,610 --> 04:14:40,149
That's shield off. No

1165
04:14:42,489 --> 04:14:45,030
No

1166
04:14:45,030 --> 04:14:47,030
Uh-oh. Okay. Get up. I guess it up

1167
04:15:15,260 --> 04:15:38,739
Get this fucking shield off

1168
04:15:39,559 --> 04:16:09,049
Ah

1169
04:16:09,049 --> 04:16:12,299
Ah

1170
04:16:12,299 --> 04:16:41,159
shit

1171
04:16:41,159 --> 04:16:54,260
There it is. Damn

1172
04:16:54,659 --> 04:17:02,809
56,000 I was yeah, I was just vibing this game's fun

1173
04:17:13,770 --> 04:17:37,159
Remask andy. It's all right. I got one gold canister and I got corak. Ooh, what else I get

1174
04:17:41,829 --> 04:17:58,219
All right upgrade wait, it's a permanent 50 discount permanently. Should I wait for that?

1175
04:17:58,299 --> 04:18:41,049
How would you wait for that? Because it's 50 off everything maximum damage. You're gonna play more games tonight

1176
04:18:41,129 --> 04:19:15,620
Yeah, you upgraded his ability not his gun. Isn't that the torch is the no, this is the launcher. I think it's upgraded

1177
04:19:17,979 --> 04:19:19,979
Yeah, look at this maximum look see

1178
04:19:21,139 --> 04:19:25,719
All right. How about this?

1179
04:19:25,719 --> 04:19:30,329
One more level. Let's let's take a break. It's been four and a half hours. No break

1180
04:19:31,129 --> 04:19:37,049
Take a break go pee come back one more level and then we'll play something else. This is very good though

1181
04:19:37,610 --> 04:19:40,520
I'm very happy with this one

1182
04:19:40,520 --> 04:19:46,950
Only four percent game progress. How long is this game? Wow. All right, I brought back go pee

1183
04:19:47,510 --> 04:23:49,659
Grab a snack or something back in like two minutes. Okay

1184
04:23:50,299 --> 04:24:16,569
These things are so good. I could eat these until I puked. I really could these pretzel rods

1185
04:24:18,250 --> 04:24:35,750
These things I could eat these until I threw up. It's got to be the rods though

1186
04:24:37,670 --> 04:24:49,209
You know what I mean, you need to get a hundred percent progress that's not going to happen tonight honey mustard

1187
04:24:50,600 --> 04:24:53,850
A lot of people are going to think i'm gross for this, but I really do mean this

1188
04:24:53,850 --> 04:25:09,559
I think I've probably talked about this before trust me you dan's game that I didn't even say anything you see ready

1189
04:25:12,309 --> 04:25:15,959
Pretzel rods. I didn't even say you you didn't I didn't even say anything yet

1190
04:25:20,500 --> 04:25:24,459
You make tuna fish, you know, like as if you were going to make a tuna fish sandwich

1191
04:25:25,430 --> 04:25:31,159
Lose the bread bowl of tuna fish, you know with the mayo like as if you're going to put it in a sandwich

1192
04:25:31,659 --> 04:25:39,610
Don't even get the bread out of the out of the container pretzel rods tuna fish dip bite get a good amount

1193
04:25:39,610 --> 04:25:52,010
Good paste of the tuna on there. I just stabbed myself in the fucking lip and i'm pissed at all of you. It's so good

1194
04:25:56,899 --> 04:26:24,120
It is so good. No spices. Just tuna mayo. So don't act like you don't do that when you have a pretzel rod

1195
04:26:24,440 --> 04:26:30,280
You don't like squish it up here and like squish it back here and put it down here and over here

1196
04:26:30,940 --> 04:26:34,840
You

1197
04:26:38,520 --> 04:26:46,409
Tuna is cat food. I burnt my screen in I burnt my screen and I burnt my screen and I burnt my screen and

1198
04:26:48,100 --> 04:26:50,389
I burnt my screen in

1199
04:26:50,389 --> 04:26:54,389
It's my my screen's ruined. I you can't see this. My screen is burnt in

1200
04:26:56,700 --> 04:26:58,569
What?

1201
04:26:58,569 --> 04:27:04,309
No, no, this is really bad. This is really bad. Hold on

1202
04:27:08,180 --> 04:27:17,180
What the fuck?

1203
04:27:17,180 --> 04:27:21,399
Why is my why is it burnt in?

1204
04:27:21,399 --> 04:27:34,260
Hold on. I gotta take a picture of this. You have to see this it's burnt into the capture card. I have no idea

1205
04:27:40,090 --> 04:27:55,879
Yeah, this is not going away. It's okay. I gotta get this into discord. You can make out the letters

1206
04:27:57,319 --> 04:28:04,870
It says like reset start. Oh my god. Let me just see what happens

1207
04:28:04,870 --> 04:28:15,930
Yeah, because when I was paused here, it says yeah resume it's burnt into the capture card. Hold on. This is so stupid

1208
04:28:16,809 --> 04:28:35,180
You can see resume options and quit. Hold on. Let me get this so I can put it on the stream. Well done

1209
04:28:35,579 --> 04:28:39,190
Okay

1210
04:28:39,190 --> 04:28:56,379
Okay, got it. All right. This is what I see right now and I i'm gonna have to probably restart everything

1211
04:29:12,360 --> 04:29:30,700
So let me know when you can see it. You see that this sucks

1212
04:29:32,059 --> 04:29:35,639
I'm gonna I have to restart the capture card probably but that's what I see

1213
04:29:44,790 --> 04:29:57,399
Resume options and quit and then game progress is right there. You're making it worse. Can you guys make it out?

1214
04:29:59,940 --> 04:30:06,979
That says resume. I am i'm

1215
04:30:07,600 --> 04:30:17,000
Flabbergasted right now. I don't know what to do. Uh, what do I what should I do about this? This is unbearable

1216
04:30:20,549 --> 04:30:24,950
It's your screen. Not your card. Hold on

1217
04:30:26,260 --> 04:30:28,260
Fuck my screen

1218
04:30:28,340 --> 04:30:34,739
Hold on a second. I'm gonna laugh my ass off if I switch to my actual monitor and is it still there?

1219
04:30:36,020 --> 04:30:46,899
Thank god. It's not okay. Wait a minute. Is it it actually might still be here? No, it can't no. No, no

1220
04:30:47,299 --> 04:30:48,979
I'm seeing things

1221
04:30:48,979 --> 04:31:02,299
It's burnt into my capture card. Um, why would you not be seeing it though? Hold on. Fuck. It's still there

1222
04:31:09,940 --> 04:31:14,659
Oh, I didn't save the game. I didn't save the game. I didn't save the game. I'm so fucking annoyed right now

1223
04:31:15,139 --> 04:31:20,360
I didn't save the game. Did I it's still there?

1224
04:31:25,930 --> 04:31:40,360
It's on the actual oh no, it's it's over reset your monitor. Hold on. Let me see if it's still here

1225
04:31:45,829 --> 04:31:47,829
Yeah, it's burnt into the fucking capture card

1226
04:31:53,430 --> 04:31:56,069
I have to take another picture. You guys need to see it

1227
04:32:03,860 --> 04:32:05,860
It's so stupid

1228
04:32:11,260 --> 04:32:17,909
What are you our savior? I wonder if I can fix it somehow

1229
04:32:20,840 --> 04:32:29,690
It's 100. No, it's not the screen because I just changed over to my different. Um, I changed over to my other input

1230
04:32:30,090 --> 04:32:39,479
Let me reset the card. It's definitely still there

1231
04:32:42,809 --> 04:32:53,540
God damn it. Give me a second. Show us again. Hold on. I wasn't even gone for that long

1232
04:32:56,680 --> 04:32:59,879
Honestly, I was I was only gone for like five minutes. Not even two minutes

1233
04:33:04,040 --> 04:33:07,560
Here. Look, here's the other one just to prove that it's a different screenshot

1234
04:33:13,849 --> 04:33:25,139
If I could get it on there, that'd be great. Here's the next one

1235
04:33:28,900 --> 04:33:30,900
This one you can see it a lot better

1236
04:33:31,349 --> 04:33:33,369
there

1237
04:33:33,369 --> 04:33:39,369
Reset your monitor. It's image retention interlacing makes that happen. Sometimes our cycle you monitor. It's 100% not burning. Okay

1238
04:33:40,250 --> 04:33:49,400
So you're saying I should not be concerned about like this for instance, right?

1239
04:33:50,040 --> 04:34:02,139
Like I shouldn't be concerned about this

1240
04:34:14,869 --> 04:34:17,909
All right. I'm gonna reset the monitor and see if that fixes it

1241
04:34:21,340 --> 04:34:32,729
okay, resetting it coming back and

1242
04:34:36,200 --> 04:34:44,330
It's still kind of there

1243
04:34:44,330 --> 04:34:57,159
Wait, I think it's better the more you play the quicker it will go away. I feel like it's very faintly there still

1244
04:34:57,240 --> 04:35:08,759
All right. Well good. Let's just go. All right. Well, sorry about that. It was weird time to replace the monitor

1245
04:35:09,240 --> 04:35:16,520
No, i'm good. It would have been funny if your face was burned in

1246
04:35:24,330 --> 04:35:33,560
You have nine more days to play smite and get the 10 year anniversary rewards. I don't I don't what what are you talking about?

1247
04:35:36,540 --> 04:35:47,979
It's still there. I'm just gonna play and see if it fixes itself. I reset the monitor. I'm just gonna play

1248
04:35:49,819 --> 04:36:09,430
That's very very annoying. What's the last place I was here? No, what opened up? Nothing. Oh, okay

1249
04:36:13,590 --> 04:36:25,639
Our cycle not reset. Are you serious? Hold on like unplug it

1250
04:36:46,889 --> 04:37:02,060
Which one of these is the power cable? Oh my god, don't spill. All right. The monitor is unplugged. Oh shit

1251
04:37:02,060 --> 04:37:10,419
What just happened with my stream? All right. I'm good. All right coming back

1252
04:37:25,509 --> 04:37:30,939
I would I would pay extra dude. I would pay extra to be able to have them on the top

1253
04:37:31,259 --> 04:37:40,150
It's still there still there. I just unplugged it and plugged it back in it's there

1254
04:37:40,229 --> 04:37:55,659
I think it might be there forever. This is actually that kind of sucks. I'll just have to deal with it

1255
04:37:59,590 --> 04:38:01,590
Yeah, I can still see resume on my screen

1256
04:38:09,189 --> 04:38:35,860
Well, the pretzel rod is worth it. What's that sound? What's that sound? What's the why do I hear like crushing water?

1257
04:38:36,340 --> 04:39:18,169
You guys don't hear this you don't hold on. Can you hear this? Can you guys hear that?

1258
04:39:21,860 --> 04:39:24,900
It's so loud. Why what's happening to my fucking computer?

1259
04:39:25,299 --> 04:39:35,529
This is a disaster because I got up to piss with my mouse

1260
04:39:42,520 --> 04:39:49,319
My everything is backwards because I unplugged the monitor and it automatically corrected it to put the monitors in the wrong place

1261
04:39:53,740 --> 04:40:12,250
You guys cannot fucking hear this. I don't know how you can't you can you guys hear the rushing water?

1262
04:40:12,490 --> 04:40:47,509
I'm trying to make it so you can hear some cables unplugged or something. I don't know how what is going on right now, huh?

1263
04:40:47,990 --> 04:41:12,459
What's what just happened? Hello. Can everybody hear me? I have no more control over obs

1264
04:41:16,169 --> 04:41:28,580
It am I even on camera? This has been an insane last 15 minutes. Um, I can't even see my other monitor

1265
04:41:44,680 --> 04:41:46,840
Yeah, I all right. Well, let's just let's just go

1266
04:41:49,669 --> 04:41:52,150
I I can't I I don't have another monitor. It's gone

1267
04:41:53,849 --> 04:41:55,849
Burn this one in this one doesn't work

1268
04:42:23,000 --> 04:42:25,000
Yeah, so what why did that happen?

1269
04:42:25,770 --> 04:42:30,169
Why would I have a bad burn in for five? It wasn't even five minutes

1270
04:42:30,650 --> 04:42:34,889
Doesn't it take like hours or days to burn into your fucking screen?

1271
04:42:35,849 --> 04:42:41,990
And then all I heard was like

1272
04:42:42,150 --> 04:43:32,650
Through my headphones. All right, I gotta get in there. This thing does a lot of damage now

1273
04:43:33,290 --> 04:43:55,020
Let's go. What did that do? Oh

1274
04:43:55,819 --> 04:44:15,619
On the ground. He's so into it. I kind of am it's just fun to shoot stuff and collect everything. It's fun

1275
04:44:17,529 --> 04:44:21,860
We'll move on after this level though. There's a bunch more stuff. I want to do tonight

1276
04:44:22,580 --> 04:44:39,610
We're gonna go long

1277
04:44:39,610 --> 04:44:58,490
Probably a 24 hour stream. No, not that long, but we'll go longer than like five for sure

1278
04:45:21,270 --> 04:45:26,569
We're gonna do a new longest stream ever. I doubt I doubt that I would say no

1279
04:45:38,090 --> 04:45:40,330
But I know I could be wrong. I could be wrong

1280
04:45:41,419 --> 04:45:45,610
I doubt it, but I could be wrong

1281
04:45:45,610 --> 04:45:47,689
I'm gonna say i'm shooting for like

1282
04:45:48,409 --> 04:45:49,750
I don't know

1283
04:45:49,750 --> 04:45:52,150
I don't have a time limit

1284
04:45:52,150 --> 04:46:08,939
It's until i'm done

1285
04:46:08,939 --> 04:46:25,669
Ooh, oh, I don't have that character ball fondler wants you to play. Wow

1286
04:46:26,069 --> 04:46:29,990
I'm pretty sure ball fondler has a bot that just writes in this channel

1287
04:46:30,569 --> 04:46:42,180
Every like three days telling me to play world of warcraft. I would not be surprised

1288
04:46:52,779 --> 04:46:53,740
Nice

1289
04:46:53,740 --> 04:47:03,299
I would uh, I would definitely stay tuned though because coming up right after this

1290
04:47:04,020 --> 04:47:11,400
I don't know. Should I see what your reaction is? I feel like people are going to be to be very upset or very happy

1291
04:47:20,500 --> 04:47:22,500
Uh, can I not get over this?

1292
04:47:22,659 --> 04:47:38,169
Apparently not I love the music. It's great

1293
04:47:44,250 --> 04:47:46,250
The music I honestly is what's keeping me here

1294
04:47:46,650 --> 04:48:12,279
So much bloom in that room

1295
04:48:12,279 --> 04:48:14,279
All right. Don't I have this ability though?

1296
04:48:14,599 --> 04:48:21,430
See it's like oh be this character. I am this character and I don't do I have how do I do that move?

1297
04:48:30,979 --> 04:48:40,200
Burn it. It was a prompt

1298
04:48:40,360 --> 04:48:53,639
Okay

1299
04:48:53,639 --> 04:48:55,259
triangle

1300
04:48:55,259 --> 04:48:57,020
Triangle switch character

1301
04:48:57,020 --> 04:49:09,000
Okay, it wants me to be this character, but then doesn't really tell me what to do after that

1302
04:49:10,360 --> 04:49:12,759
Oh, it just lets you cross the lava. Okay

1303
04:49:13,479 --> 04:49:49,349
Did you get a snack from the gas station? Yeah, why not?

1304
04:49:56,040 --> 04:50:05,159
Yeah, go get a snack. You know, it's actually pretty good. I hate pepsi

1305
04:50:05,979 --> 04:50:08,619
but the that nitro pepsi is actually

1306
04:50:09,750 --> 04:50:12,069
Like at least at least an eight or nine out of ten

1307
04:50:17,849 --> 04:50:19,849
Nitro pepsi is actually pretty good

1308
04:50:27,669 --> 04:50:32,549
I can only really drink one of those every so often because they I feel like they're so much sweeter

1309
04:50:33,349 --> 04:50:34,709
They're really good

1310
04:50:34,709 --> 04:50:40,659
I don't believe that's real. No, it is check it out. Good

1311
04:50:54,380 --> 04:50:55,979
milk pepsi

1312
04:50:55,979 --> 04:50:57,979
No, no, no, no nitro pepsi

1313
04:50:58,700 --> 04:51:13,159
It's good

1314
04:51:13,159 --> 04:51:16,889
Hilt, you know, i've actually heard that term before

1315
04:51:17,529 --> 04:51:19,529
I've never tried it but

1316
04:51:19,610 --> 04:51:23,259
It probably that honestly doesn't even sound that bad

1317
04:51:25,319 --> 04:51:29,959
People do ice cream floats and stuff. Isn't that just kind of a float without it being frozen?

1318
04:51:31,450 --> 04:51:38,439
Kind of

1319
04:51:38,439 --> 04:51:45,099

But then cherry coke really took it over

1356
04:57:17,720 --> 04:57:24,099

Hold on. Wait, you guys aren't getting that. No, you're not. Okay. All right, let's keep going

I know let's make them a tunnel

1402
05:03:07,130 --> 05:03:11,930
I was to leave the wildlife along over a piece of pipe using the directional buttons

1403
05:03:12,409 --> 05:03:17,880
And pick it up using the x button move the pipe over the hole you think it should go in

1404
05:03:18,279 --> 05:03:20,599
Then press the x button to drop it in

Move the bowl around the screen using the directional buttons until pilchard snores get louder

1420
05:04:40,540 --> 05:04:42,860

This is a glitchless

1599
05:38:33,720 --> 05:38:35,959
Speed run glitchless any percent speed run

1600
05:38:37,299 --> 05:38:44,279
all mini games

1601
05:38:44,680 --> 05:38:46,680
I want to reset so bad

1602
05:38:47,000 --> 05:38:49,000
I have to reset one more time. I swear to god i'm not gonna do it again

1603
05:38:51,659 --> 05:38:58,330
Hold on. This is this is a glitchless any percent speed run. I promise i'm not gonna reset ever again

1604
05:38:58,729 --> 05:39:02,819
One, two, three go Travis's race. I promise

1605
05:39:05,000 --> 05:39:14,700
Last one for real scoop on your marks get set go

1606
05:39:17,159 --> 05:39:19,639
Scoop has Travis watch out scoop

1607
05:39:32,250 --> 05:39:34,250
lap two

1608
05:39:35,139 --> 05:39:37,139
Watch out scoop

1609
05:39:37,380 --> 05:39:51,240
lap three

1610
05:39:51,240 --> 05:39:57,900
Watch out scoop

1611
05:40:04,180 --> 05:40:14,650
I'm not gonna restart. No, i'm going scoop

1612
05:40:26,119 --> 05:40:33,700
I'm not resetting. I just need sub 12 and i'll move on. I promise on your marks get set up 12. I swear to god

1613
05:40:34,659 --> 05:40:37,540
dizzy past Travis

1614
05:40:51,349 --> 05:41:09,400
lap two lap three

1615
05:41:10,200 --> 05:41:29,430
Watch out that was shit placement and you all know it good job dizzy

1616
05:41:31,830 --> 05:41:33,830
All right, that's the worst part of the whole run

1617
05:41:37,830 --> 05:41:42,310
That's the shittiest part of the run plumbing puzzle

1618
05:41:45,860 --> 05:41:58,810
Can I move faster here crow is the worst one?

1619
05:41:59,450 --> 05:42:30,169
That was clean clean good timing

1620
05:42:32,409 --> 05:42:39,689
Think is bad bad rng. I think it gets up 12

1621
05:42:42,740 --> 05:42:58,470
Just can't mess up the crow part. It's not there. Don't be fooled

1622
05:42:59,029 --> 05:43:01,029
Lots of other runners get fooled by that

1623
05:43:01,270 --> 05:43:19,509
I don't think I could do this one any better if I wanted to

1624
05:43:48,840 --> 05:43:55,290
god like rng

1625
05:43:55,290 --> 05:44:00,330
Absolutely god like rng great holy shit all done pray for that kind of fucking rng

1626
05:44:10,939 --> 05:44:33,159
Can we build a job loppy?

1627
05:44:40,229 --> 05:44:42,229
Great good job loppy

1628
05:44:46,740 --> 05:44:48,740
Good job loppy

1629
05:44:54,360 --> 05:44:57,560
Great good job. Come on. Keep going keep going keep going

1630
05:45:14,180 --> 05:45:18,360
Do it right. Can you get the next section now?

1631
05:45:19,479 --> 05:45:20,599
Yes

1632
05:45:20,599 --> 05:45:22,040
Good work

1633
05:45:22,040 --> 05:45:24,040
We can build it

1634
05:45:38,150 --> 05:45:40,150
Where can she be

1635
05:45:41,779 --> 05:45:42,819
Good

1636
05:45:42,819 --> 05:45:52,650
I'm definitely gonna get sub 12. No doubt porcupine rest

1637
05:45:58,900 --> 05:46:04,180
This one's really really tricky. If you don't get a good rng, then i'm just gonna stop saying that word because like I don't know

1638
05:46:04,180 --> 05:46:08,150
What the fuck i'm talking about

1639
05:46:08,150 --> 05:46:10,150
That's it loppy

1640
05:46:10,150 --> 05:46:14,439
I couldn't press it. I couldn't press it. It wouldn't let me

1641
05:46:16,340 --> 05:46:17,860
That's it loppy

1642
05:46:17,860 --> 05:46:32,099
That's it loppy. Yes. That's great. The porcupines will be safe now. That wasn't a joke

1643
05:46:32,740 --> 05:46:47,400
Where can she be

1644
05:46:48,459 --> 05:46:51,340
Definitely way better than last time

1645
05:46:59,909 --> 05:47:01,669
Scary easy

1646
05:47:01,669 --> 05:47:42,630
Making sure it's on easy. This one sucks. This is making this is gonna make a break the whole run get out what?

1647
05:47:59,029 --> 05:48:01,349
Get the fuck out of here. All right, that was

1648
05:48:02,490 --> 05:48:04,090
They gotta land

1649
05:48:04,090 --> 05:48:06,729
No, you want them not to land so they eat your crops

1650
05:48:09,340 --> 05:48:23,799
i'm fine

1651
05:48:23,799 --> 05:48:32,299
There's not much left. We have dance party. We have what's left

1652
05:48:35,290 --> 05:48:47,290
Wendy's birthday when his fucking birthday. Just okay. Here we go. Do I need to use all the ingredients?

1653
05:48:47,610 --> 05:48:51,750
Do I have to use all the ingredients finished?

1654
05:48:52,779 --> 05:48:57,020
Wendy i've got a surprise for you. No, I don't. Okay. All right. Good. Good. Good

1655
05:49:29,430 --> 05:49:38,099
This is it. This is it coming up. He's doing the cubrics there. Is it time after this?

1656
05:49:41,529 --> 05:49:51,479
Is that it what about your time time when right?

1657
05:49:51,479 --> 05:49:53,880
Yeah

1658
05:49:53,880 --> 05:50:08,729
Bubble trouble. Oh fuck. Oops. Oh no. Oh no

1659
05:50:09,209 --> 05:50:20,409
Why is wendy's birthday in front of bubble trouble?

1660
05:50:23,540 --> 05:50:27,540
Uh, it was so I was probably gonna be sub 12 probably probably even sub like 11 30

1661
05:50:34,950 --> 05:51:05,509
Well, let's just let's just see what would happen. Let's just see what if I did this so clean last time

1662
05:51:06,310 --> 05:51:09,000
Yeah, so now I uh

1663
05:51:09,560 --> 05:51:11,560
That sucks. It would have been sub 12

1664
05:51:12,040 --> 05:51:17,220
I know it's i'm not it's an illegal run. I'm not saying it's legal. Okay. Can I do this one more time?

1665
05:51:19,979 --> 05:51:24,700
Move the bowl around the screen. A lot of people don't want me to do this, but like can I do it one more time?

1666
05:51:25,500 --> 05:51:27,340
Where can she be?

1667
05:51:27,340 --> 05:51:30,939
Because there's that's a sub 12 run right there. When do I hit the stop?

1668
05:51:30,939 --> 05:51:44,150
When do I write when the cutscene ends, please? No viewers are gonna plug it. It's only 10 minutes

1669
05:51:44,709 --> 05:51:47,639
It's the last input

1670
05:51:47,639 --> 05:52:02,779
It's only 10 minutes dude. My six-year-old has never been more interested in you. Can I have one more attempt?

1671
05:52:04,220 --> 05:52:05,740
I promise I

1672
05:52:05,740 --> 05:52:12,459
This is the last time and no resets either and I promise like my head's not like shaped

1673
05:52:13,930 --> 05:52:18,860
Like I had my head's not made of clay. I promise. I don't know what this I don't know

1674
05:52:18,860 --> 05:52:23,740
What's going on back here, but I promise it's I didn't it's not what it's normal. It's not as abnormal

1675
05:52:26,340 --> 05:52:31,349
Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right, right. You should watch the world record

1676
05:52:31,430 --> 05:52:33,430
No, no, I don't want to I don't want to get anything in my head

1677
05:52:39,159 --> 05:52:42,409
This is it

1678
05:52:42,409 --> 05:52:45,159
Does it matter what I start with?

1679
05:52:45,799 --> 05:52:47,799
Could I start with bubble trouble?

1680
05:52:55,099 --> 05:52:55,979
No

1681
05:52:55,979 --> 05:53:02,700
Why not if you don't get sub-12 you have to drink pilk. Okay

1682
05:53:10,419 --> 05:53:15,990
Okay, if I get if I don't get sub-12 i'll drink a glass of pilk on stream in like 20 minutes

1683
05:53:17,189 --> 05:53:20,069
All right. This is it. This is this is one i'm gonna start with bubble trouble. Is that illegal?

1684
05:53:20,310 --> 05:53:25,369
Can I actually start on this or is that illegal read the mod chat?

1685
05:53:37,000 --> 05:53:40,599
World record video stops the timer when the final loading screen pops up

1686
05:53:40,840 --> 05:53:45,720
The world record starts with the radiators and the crows since they have the most rng

1687
05:53:51,029 --> 05:53:56,630
All right, so we're starting with radiator. No, we're gonna do it my way starting with bubble trouble

1688
05:53:57,750 --> 05:54:05,400
No resets no bullshit. This is it. I'm trying when we sub-12 illegal i'm gonna get a it's gonna be legal

1689
05:54:07,130 --> 05:54:13,240
I'm not gonna pause then unpause and no, this is just really going crows only count if they land first. Okay

1690
05:54:13,319 --> 05:54:15,880
All right. I'm ready. I'm ready to get sub-12

1691
05:54:15,959 --> 05:54:19,099
And i'm gonna do my strap

1692
05:54:19,979 --> 05:54:23,340
All right, i'm gonna start because I want wendy's birthday to be the end of the run

1693
05:54:26,099 --> 05:54:32,919
Bubbled trouble. I did it out of order. It's uh, what can I do it out of order? Is that okay? What the fuck happened back?

1694
05:54:33,639 --> 05:55:04,250
Bubbled trouble not bad not bad

1695
05:55:19,259 --> 05:55:31,349
I almost fucked that up

1696
05:55:32,310 --> 05:55:35,700
No travis's race day

You put that shit right there it's hard you can't avoid that. Okay, don't die a godly bubble run

1700
05:56:26,779 --> 05:56:44,819
Don't blow it here

1701
05:56:45,900 --> 05:56:47,900
Why are you doing the cringe face to me? What?

1702
05:56:47,979 --> 05:56:49,979
Why'd you do that scoop is

1703
05:56:58,680 --> 05:57:08,409
Don't throw I won't if I can get through this in three minutes. I'll be good marks get set go

1704
05:57:09,380 --> 05:57:11,619

I'm gonna stop pay attention. You're not like, you know, just like you're not streaming right now

You're fucking getting a sub 12. Um, don't look look at chat and start talking give us a good. Uh, good run here. Come on

1714
05:59:44,790 --> 05:59:46,950

A week there. Sorry not bad. I think i'm on pace. Can we

Good job lofty

1722

Let's build a new bridge. That's actually a massive time save

1723
06:00:59,080 --> 06:01:16,200
Right. Can you get the next section now?

1724
06:01:18,099 --> 06:01:19,220
Yes

1725
06:01:19,220 --> 06:01:22,419

Shit rng on this one. I'm serious

Because I have to go all the way back

1730
06:02:22,119 --> 06:02:24,709
It has to bounce

1731
06:02:24,709 --> 06:02:26,709
Absolutely, just terrible terrible

06:02:52,659 --> 06:02:54,659
Where can she be?

1735
06:02:56,340 --> 06:03:06,549
Almost there

1736
06:03:06,549 --> 06:03:14,790
Scaries

1737
06:03:14,790 --> 06:03:21,830
All right, let him land let him land right let him land. Let him land

1738
06:03:30,419 --> 06:03:32,020
Let them all land

1739
06:03:32,020 --> 06:04:02,540
Is that all right?

1740
06:04:02,540 --> 06:04:19,819
Where can she be?

1741
06:04:23,450 --> 06:04:31,130
Just the birthday party and we're done

1742
06:04:31,529 --> 06:04:44,459
Wendy's birthday finished

1743
06:04:45,560 --> 06:05:03,450
Wendy i've got a surprise for you. Thank you, bob. You missed one

1744
06:05:03,689 --> 06:05:05,689
What did I skip? What did I do?

1745
06:05:06,470 --> 06:05:13,689
No, no, I didn't i'm good. It's gonna be close. So at the loading screen, right?

1746
06:05:21,459 --> 06:05:23,459
Give me that sub 11. Let's go. Come on

1747
06:05:35,930 --> 06:05:47,189
Come on

1748
06:05:47,189 --> 06:05:51,779
1102 back

1749
06:05:53,799 --> 06:05:57,880
1102 that's a big I could do more than that. I could get probably sub 10

1750
06:05:59,509 --> 06:06:11,939
Don't please don't do it again. Hey, I got the sub 12. That's all I care about that's seventh place. What's

1751
06:06:12,419 --> 06:06:16,500
What's fifth place

1752
06:06:16,500 --> 06:06:26,520
Tell me what fifth place is. I just want to know 10 16 is fifth place

1753
06:06:26,599 --> 06:06:32,090
I don't know if i'll get top five 10 16

1754
06:06:39,110 --> 06:06:40,229
Just so we're all on the same page

1755
06:06:40,229 --> 06:06:45,509
You speed ran bob the builder for an hour before you even considered purchasing a spiral game for the ps1

1756
06:06:49,779 --> 06:06:51,959
Sounds about right. I think

1757
06:06:53,560 --> 06:06:58,900

Okay, don't stay on these for too long. Why do you let it go?

1902

There's a laugh track in there. There's a laugh track in the game when you do something funny

1914
06:25:44,200 --> 06:25:46,200

Ah

1998
06:42:50,779 --> 06:42:56,520
The vibration is on the controller. Did you hear that? It's doing it still

Okay, here you go. I've got here is the milk right here it is. So now we take the coca cola

2002
06:43:26,970 --> 06:43:29,770
I thought something just bad happened. I thought like my ceiling caved in

2003
06:43:31,560 --> 06:43:32,520
Okay

2004
06:43:32,520 --> 06:43:44,119
Here we go

2005
06:43:44,119 --> 06:43:45,560
People drink this

2006
06:43:45,560 --> 06:44:05,279
Do I need to stir it? She needs to that's so much. That is so much. I didn't realize I just made it a lot

2007
06:44:06,040 --> 06:44:10,759
I just made it as if I love this and i'm gonna drink it all the time every day. That's a full glass

2008
06:44:11,799 --> 06:44:14,599
I'm gonna fucking break it get away from me. Stop

2009
06:44:15,819 --> 06:44:17,790
That's a lot

2010
06:44:17,790 --> 06:44:19,790
Oh, I have to drink this. Okay. Here we go

2011
06:44:43,759 --> 06:44:48,279
Okay, it tastes like

2012
06:44:48,279 --> 06:44:49,880
you know when you have a

2013
06:44:49,880 --> 06:44:52,040
Float like a root beer float or a coke float

2014
06:44:52,840 --> 06:44:56,599
And you get to the very very bottom but there's nothing left in the glass

2015
06:44:57,240 --> 06:45:01,479
But there's a little bit of this weird foam fluid down there

2016
06:45:03,360 --> 06:45:10,720
That's what this tastes like

2017
06:45:10,799 --> 06:45:12,799
I mean, it's not that good

2018
06:45:13,720 --> 06:45:15,720
But I wouldn't consider this to be bad

2019
06:45:18,349 --> 06:45:21,209
I wouldn't say this is bad

2020
06:45:21,209 --> 06:45:23,209
This does not this does not taste bad

2021
06:45:28,889 --> 06:45:33,369
You guys are gonna get me so fucked up now i'm gonna just wait i'm gonna drink this like tomorrow and the next day

2022
06:45:33,369 --> 06:45:35,369
And the next day i'll be like, yeah, i'm just doing it ironically

2023
06:45:35,930 --> 06:45:37,529
Same shit's gonna happen to me

2024
06:45:37,529 --> 06:45:39,520
But like takis

2025
06:45:39,520 --> 06:45:44,880
I bought takis. I tried them. I told you guys they were the world most disgusting vile snack i've ever eaten

2026
06:45:45,919 --> 06:45:47,919
And now I can't stop eating them

2027
06:45:52,090 --> 06:45:54,250
I seriously thought takis were a zero

2028
06:45:56,009 --> 06:45:58,779
zero

2029
06:45:58,779 --> 06:45:59,900
and

2030
06:45:59,900 --> 06:46:04,540
I just was like, oh, haha. I think me and holly were literally at the grocery store. It's like oh

2031
06:46:05,180 --> 06:46:07,180
Let's get those. Isn't that funny?

2032
06:46:07,180 --> 06:46:10,220
Yeah, they're gross. They suck. I haven't had them in a while. You wanna try one?

2033
06:46:11,099 --> 06:46:13,099
and then we both go like

2034
06:46:15,819 --> 06:46:17,819
That lime's kind of good though

2035
06:46:18,380 --> 06:46:21,500
Gross I hate you hate them too. I hate them too

2036
06:46:22,799 --> 06:46:25,240
and then

2037
06:46:25,240 --> 06:46:27,240
Ever since I bought them every time

2038
06:46:28,119 --> 06:46:32,279
I've ever gone to the grocery store since it's not an ironic funny joke anymore

2039
06:46:33,479 --> 06:46:35,479
Just doing it and I just enjoy it and I like it

2040
06:46:36,200 --> 06:46:49,290
What's wrong with me?

2041
06:46:49,290 --> 06:46:51,450
It's not good. Like I just it's not good

2042
06:46:52,090 --> 06:46:56,750
But it's definitely not the reaction. I think a lot of people thought was gonna happen where i'm like

2043
06:46:57,549 --> 06:46:59,549
Like spitting it. No, it's like fine

2044
06:47:00,200 --> 06:47:02,200
It tastes like fizzy milk

2045
06:47:03,180 --> 06:47:05,180
It tastes like carbonated milk

2046
06:47:05,580 --> 06:47:07,020
But sweet

2047
06:47:07,020 --> 06:47:11,659
It's like the bottom of a root beer float. It's just like whatever you have serious problems

2048
06:47:16,409 --> 06:47:20,060
You're gaslighting yourself

2049
06:47:20,060 --> 06:47:22,779
Yeah, it's the bottom of a root beer float. You if you know if you know, you know

2050
06:47:23,419 --> 06:47:27,500
I would not recommend drinking this for any reason unless it's like somebody bet you and they're like, oh dude drink

2051
06:47:27,580 --> 06:47:32,590
It'll be funny. This shit is fucking cold though

2052
06:47:33,229 --> 06:47:36,909
This shit is gold

2053
06:47:36,909 --> 06:47:39,150
This is the good shit. I'm telling you. This is the good shit

2054
06:47:40,759 --> 06:47:44,439
You want you want do you want to drink gold milk? Get it telling you this is the good shit

2055
06:47:46,299 --> 06:47:49,340
This that this is a it's a delicacy in this household

2056
06:47:50,060 --> 06:47:55,659
All right. Let me let me bring this back. I don't want to put it in the fridge

2057
06:49:11,119 --> 06:49:13,119
Let's see what we do gonna get burnt into this

2058
06:49:13,840 --> 06:49:20,430
And i'm done look at this why is it vibrating show what on the screen is happening for it to be vibrating show me

2059
06:49:23,159 --> 06:49:26,360
What is going on on screen to have to have a vibrate the controller that hard?

2060
06:49:28,779 --> 06:49:32,939
God, I need a break

2061
06:49:32,939 --> 06:49:34,939
That's a good break

2062
06:49:35,740 --> 06:49:45,020
It's scooby scratching

2063
06:49:45,020 --> 06:49:54,360
All right. So what can I do with the double jump?

2064
06:50:01,599 --> 06:50:07,529
Sue's drunk on pill

2065
06:50:07,529 --> 06:50:09,529
Jump off the boat with a double jump

2066
06:50:20,939 --> 06:50:26,270
Thank you for playing these even if you had to skip vampire countdown. I mean

2067
06:50:27,529 --> 06:50:30,729

06:50:33,290 --> 06:50:35,930
These these place these old kind of grab bag

2069
06:50:37,450 --> 06:50:42,669
You never know what you're gonna get if you be anything we could get absolute dog shit or we get a fucking legendary

2070
06:50:42,729 --> 06:50:44,729
Bionicle game, you know what I mean?

2071
06:50:45,229 --> 06:50:53,799
Can I not go this way?

2072
06:50:53,799 --> 06:51:00,669
Oh, I thought that was it. All right, so let's go in the boat and somebody's a jump off the boat

2073
06:51:15,369 --> 06:51:17,450
All right, there was something I couldn't reach before right

2074
06:51:18,569 --> 06:51:22,250
Happy always told me you plant where should I go?

2075
06:51:24,009 --> 06:51:36,799

And it's not reach i'm touching it

2077
06:51:46,409 --> 06:51:49,849
What does scooby do his favorite food do we know is it a scooby snack

2078
06:51:55,040 --> 06:51:56,799
Has it actually ever been?

2079
06:51:56,799 --> 06:51:59,880
Decided what it is

2080
06:51:59,880 --> 06:52:02,680
Is it scooby snacks? I feel like that's so I feel like that's easy though

2081
06:52:03,400 --> 06:52:05,799
Oh, it's like a crunchy like dog treat

06:54:58,720 --> 06:55:03,130
Do you think they would win here food doesn't grow on trees

Do you think that they would actually win?

2096
06:55:06,349 --> 06:55:10,250
What if they had like good policy?

2097
06:55:10,250 --> 06:55:12,810
I feel like it'd be kind of funny

2098
06:55:12,889 --> 06:55:32,220

Mm-hmm. It was a little more than that. I have the double jump I can jump across

06:57:37,900 --> 06:57:39,099
Worth it

2109
06:57:39,099 --> 06:57:46,270
It was worth it

2110
06:57:54,880 --> 06:57:58,009
I got a token

2111
06:57:58,919 --> 06:58:00,919

2115
06:58:58,560 --> 06:59:02,139
Holy shit, that was pretty good. All right under the chandelier

2117
06:59:04,409 --> 06:59:16,319
How do I get up there? What do you do with the token? The tokens just sit in your inventory?

2118
06:59:17,200 --> 06:59:22,619

2123
07:00:32,779 --> 07:00:47,900

2124
07:00:48,619 --> 07:01:38,040
Okay, somebody said I can jump to a key that's somewhere out here. Where is it the playground? There's a gap in the mansion

2125
07:01:42,200 --> 07:01:47,840
I don't think there's anything over here

2126
07:01:47,840 --> 07:01:51,290
Gap in the mansion

2127
07:01:51,369 --> 07:01:55,849

2130
07:02:20,459 --> 07:02:35,959
Gap in the mansion

2131
07:02:35,959 --> 07:02:37,400
All right, we're moving on

2132
07:02:37,400 --> 07:02:39,080

07:20:04,860 --> 07:20:08,220
Let me show you how to use objects walk up to the button and press x

2247
07:20:09,020 --> 07:20:20,909
That was I just punched

2248
07:20:43,200 --> 07:20:48,779
I don't know. I don't know how to do it press the button

2249
07:20:53,900 --> 07:20:55,500
No

2250
07:20:55,500 --> 07:20:58,299
Good. Remember to use any object press x button

2251
07:20:59,159 --> 07:21:01,159
Unfortunately, this button seems to be broken

2252
07:21:01,400 --> 07:21:04,119
We don't have the time to wait to get it fixed so you'll have to do it yourself

2253
07:21:05,240 --> 07:21:06,279
what

2254
07:21:06,279 --> 07:21:11,060
Try this toolkit pick it up. Just walk over it and then try pressing x button on the switch again

2255
07:21:14,310 --> 07:21:17,110
Why do I walk a waddle around like I made it a fucking clay?

2256
07:21:18,150 --> 07:21:23,830
Okay, I got a toolkit

2257
07:21:23,830 --> 07:21:30,740
Pick up the toolkit by walk. I just did it

2258
07:21:31,060 --> 07:21:33,619
Did you not just watch me do that?

2259
07:21:34,580 --> 07:21:38,099
Very good. You're learning fast to see what objects you have in your possession press select

2260
07:21:38,740 --> 07:21:40,900
Okay

2261
07:21:40,900 --> 07:21:42,659
Cool bare hands

2262
07:21:50,580 --> 07:21:54,419
Sometimes you'll have to search other objects to get them this door needs a security car to open it

2263
07:21:54,419 --> 07:22:16,470
There's one in that desk. Did you just cut me off when I was in the middle of doing it?

2264
07:22:18,540 --> 07:22:29,349
I was doing it

2265
07:22:30,619 --> 07:22:33,080
What

2266
07:22:33,080 --> 07:22:44,340
Fuck out of here

2267
07:22:44,340 --> 07:22:48,150
I'm just kidding with you. I'm just messing around

2268
07:22:57,849 --> 07:22:59,979
Hey, you locked me out

2269
07:22:59,979 --> 07:23:01,979
Make your way around the side. I'll see you later

2270
07:23:08,310 --> 07:23:10,310
Don't get stuck in this game

2271
07:23:11,349 --> 07:23:17,369
Climb over any obstacle

2272
07:23:17,369 --> 07:23:19,959
Good to know I would have I never would have figured that out

2273
07:23:24,180 --> 07:23:26,180
You want to watch out for the

2274
07:23:26,240 --> 07:23:31,939
Excavation run up to it and then jump over it using triangle. Don't miss though. It's a long way down

2275
07:23:39,979 --> 07:23:44,500
oops

2276
07:23:44,580 --> 07:23:52,099
Mid-jump you gotta I think I can fucking make it

2277
07:23:54,090 --> 07:23:56,810
I can I can make it I can I can I can I can I can

2278
07:23:59,909 --> 07:24:03,990
I've got a prediction. I think this might be the gem of the night. I'm just saying

2279
07:24:05,639 --> 07:24:08,040
I'm just saying I think this has got

2280
07:24:09,139 --> 07:24:11,880
Unbelievable potential and I mean unbelievable potential

2281
07:24:17,540 --> 07:24:31,319
The versus has a nine on their back. What is that?

2282
07:24:32,119 --> 07:24:36,979
Practice punching and kicking. There's a kick

2283
07:24:37,619 --> 07:24:43,799
Oh, that is not a kick that it that is a like

2284
07:24:44,439 --> 07:24:46,439
a post-op

2285
07:24:46,439 --> 07:24:56,740
Oh, I can't wait to play this

2286
07:24:56,819 --> 07:25:00,340
Okay, you will find blocking to be very useful in any fights you get into

2287
07:25:02,900 --> 07:25:04,900
I think I okay block

2288
07:25:05,459 --> 07:25:21,619
Will you do something?

2289
07:25:21,619 --> 07:25:23,299
He's not fighting

2290
07:25:23,299 --> 07:25:24,659
He's not

2291
07:25:24,659 --> 07:25:36,599
Kick his ass. I'm supposed to be blocking a punch. He just won't punch punch me, please

2292
07:25:42,840 --> 07:25:43,959
What

2293
07:25:43,959 --> 07:25:50,549
How do I stop looking at this guy?

2294
07:26:00,419 --> 07:26:10,099
Wait, I go the wrong way

2295
07:26:10,099 --> 07:26:11,220
Where

2296
07:26:11,220 --> 07:26:13,220
Where are we right now?

2297
07:26:13,619 --> 07:26:16,259
Where are we? This is a strange what?

2298
07:26:16,979 --> 07:26:19,540
It's like dirt wood concrete

2299
07:26:23,020 --> 07:26:24,380
What is going on?

2300
07:26:24,380 --> 07:26:26,869
It's a construction site

2301
07:26:28,409 --> 07:26:31,130
This looks just weird. It's just a weird place

2302
07:26:31,770 --> 07:26:39,849
How do I get the hell out of here? He said follow me follow you to follow you where?

2303
07:26:47,479 --> 07:26:49,319
Can you open this open the door?

2304
07:26:49,319 --> 07:26:53,900
to the ring

2305
07:26:53,900 --> 07:26:59,060
his foot ring

2306
07:26:59,060 --> 07:27:05,180
Down the ramp

2307
07:27:05,180 --> 07:27:09,979
I physically could not walk down there a minute ago. I was running into invisible wall

2308
07:27:15,380 --> 07:27:16,580
combos

2309
07:27:16,580 --> 07:27:20,659
With his back to you as joe teach you how to knock guards unconscious

2310
07:27:21,220 --> 07:27:24,500
Further away is Morgan with whom you can try out everything you've learned

2311
07:27:31,479 --> 07:27:33,479
You won't kill a guard with this move

2312
07:27:34,220 --> 07:27:36,220
Good. That's not my style. Anyway

2313
07:27:36,709 --> 07:27:38,869
I know however, he'll be out cold for a while

2314
07:27:39,830 --> 07:27:42,229
So I don't need to worry about him waking up while i'm still around

2315
07:27:43,110 --> 07:27:47,830
Correct one more thing if you're going to pull this move off the guard has to be totally unaware of your presence

2316
07:27:48,549 --> 07:27:56,740
Okay

2317
07:27:56,740 --> 07:28:00,150
combo

2318
07:28:00,150 --> 07:28:14,119
Yeah, all right 100 of this. All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. I'm ready

2319
07:28:14,840 --> 07:28:19,189
And try out all the skills you've learned

2320
07:28:20,060 --> 07:28:22,740
He's not going to show any mercy

2321
07:28:42,759 --> 07:28:50,069
All right, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay

2322
07:28:50,790 --> 07:28:53,959
Sneak into the factory

2323
07:28:53,959 --> 07:28:58,599
No, i'm not nearly as stealthy as you. I got the blueprints the details the pro route

2324
07:29:00,169 --> 07:29:51,500
All right, fuck off. Is there a heel? Okay. Hold down r1 to sneak use the brain wave monitor

2325
07:29:51,819 --> 07:30:20,389
This guard isn't looking in your directions. He's sneakers

2326
07:30:27,259 --> 07:30:35,340
Okay

2327
07:30:35,340 --> 07:30:37,979
You can peer around corners by holding l2

2328
07:30:38,619 --> 07:30:40,619
And use the controls, okay

2329
07:30:40,700 --> 07:31:26,090
Okay, so what's okay crouches r1?

2330
07:31:41,139 --> 07:32:06,150
Is he looking over here? Where can I leave?

2331
07:32:07,110 --> 07:32:16,169
What are you talking? No, no game over not game over that the guy's looking this way and this way

2332
07:32:16,490 --> 07:32:18,490
He's looking this way and this way. He's looking the same direction

2333
07:32:22,200 --> 07:32:28,869
The fuck is this guy?

2334
07:32:28,869 --> 07:32:30,869
Oh my god. All right. All right. All right

2335
07:32:31,029 --> 07:32:38,869
This might be causing the crackling the disk speed thing. Oh, is it spinning too fast?

2336
07:32:55,049 --> 07:33:21,540
Here's this guy

2337
07:33:21,619 --> 07:33:23,060
Whoa, okay

2338
07:33:23,060 --> 07:33:32,919
Don't peek your head out like that. Stop. All right. So how can I tell when this guy can it can see me?

2339
07:33:33,000 --> 07:33:35,080
He's looking like this and then he's looking like this

2340
07:33:45,720 --> 07:33:53,270
What direction is he looking?

2341
07:33:56,740 --> 07:34:04,310
Because to on to me he's looking in the same direction. Oh my god. He's looking at me. Oh my god

2342
07:34:18,340 --> 07:34:21,770
Is this a sex game fan that person for like 10 minutes?

2343
07:34:38,150 --> 07:34:57,580
Shadows are your friend. Okay, you can hide in them. Where is this person?

2344
07:35:04,020 --> 07:35:31,669
Yeah, I quit I let me play I let me find one of the stealth shit let me play the game

2345
07:35:32,470 --> 07:35:39,400
Wait, I think I fucked the game up. I'm good

2346
07:35:41,880 --> 07:35:43,639
I yeah, I messed it up

2347
07:35:43,639 --> 07:36:01,049
Okay, they beep at regular intervals. What just happened? That was very wait

2348
07:36:04,599 --> 07:36:06,840
Uh something got messed up here

2349
07:37:35,700 --> 07:37:44,740
What why was he right behind me? I don't need to do the training anymore. I'm done. I know I know

2350
07:37:45,939 --> 07:37:48,919
I know how to play the game. Okay, I don't need to do this anymore

2351
07:38:32,330 --> 07:38:38,729
Fuck oh, okay. What happened?

2352
07:38:39,610 --> 07:38:48,970
The shocking scene before you is that of the appalling situation that has developed at the opening of the w chemical factory here in venezuela

2353
07:38:49,669 --> 07:38:55,430
The south american redemption have taken over the building but insists their intentions are peaceful

2354
07:38:57,529 --> 07:39:04,970
I can see now the head of the w group lago winch being escorted alongside our very own tanio conocova

2355
07:39:05,130 --> 07:39:08,090
Who was sent to interview lago winch earlier today?

2356
07:39:08,569 --> 07:39:15,529
This is an important development if they release the head of the w corporation it shows they definitely are peaceful

2357
07:39:16,729 --> 07:39:18,490
So what do I have to do?

2358
07:39:18,490 --> 07:39:22,650
This is an ai voice

2359
07:39:25,220 --> 07:39:30,580
Another shocking development it appears a lago and tanio are being held hostage

2360
07:39:33,540 --> 07:39:34,659
What

2361
07:39:34,659 --> 07:39:43,110
What wait, okay. I saw I gotta get in there lago lago. Come on

2362
07:39:43,669 --> 07:39:45,659
What's wrong joy?

2363
07:39:45,659 --> 07:39:52,819
Simon lago has been kidnapped by operatives from the south american redemption. He'll be okay joy

2364
07:39:52,819 --> 07:39:56,180
He's been in situations like this before if anyone can escape lago can

2365
07:39:56,900 --> 07:39:59,909
I hope you're right find out

2366
07:40:03,319 --> 07:40:23,819
Okay, this is where the game begins. I'm ready. What oh can I

2367
07:40:24,459 --> 07:40:28,540
I'll get you out of here. Can I untie?

2368
07:40:30,220 --> 07:40:31,099
No

2369
07:40:31,099 --> 07:40:33,099
Is there no I probably need like a thing

2370
07:40:36,340 --> 07:40:47,799
I must find a way to get the power back on in here the fuse missing my tool kit

2371
07:40:50,229 --> 07:40:58,619
No punch the ropes. I swear i'll figure it out. Wait, maybe I can go inside this car

2372
07:40:59,259 --> 07:41:02,740
Maybe I'll get a car battery

2373
07:41:02,740 --> 07:41:13,349
Yeah, I think I can okay elevator should work

2374
07:41:22,979 --> 07:41:27,830
I don't know how to get out of here

2375
07:41:27,830 --> 07:41:30,229
I thought I didn't think that was an elevator. I have to be honest

2376
07:41:30,790 --> 07:41:50,500
Why would I just leave that person gone? That's a gun. Oh, it's a radio

2377
07:41:54,549 --> 07:41:59,349
They're not peaceful at all. They planted a bomb inside the main building somewhere. You have to find it and defuse it

2378
07:42:02,060 --> 07:42:22,869
Do I have to who am I gonna stop these people?

2379
07:42:28,729 --> 07:42:35,959
I think you got too much coffee

2380
07:42:36,439 --> 07:42:38,439
I have no idea what he said

2381
07:42:39,080 --> 07:42:44,709
What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

2382
07:42:58,279 --> 07:42:59,880
Oh shit

2383
07:42:59,880 --> 07:43:06,279
Turn around and face him

2384
07:43:10,970 --> 07:43:20,680
Fuck christ. We're good. Go. Nope

2385
07:43:21,400 --> 07:43:46,840
I'll go they've got the main doors locked down. There's no way through find another way around. Okay. Well, thanks for the info

2386
07:43:55,060 --> 07:44:01,020
Here he spent four hundred dollars on this. No, this one was seven bucks

2387
07:44:07,459 --> 07:44:09,459
Don't fucking knock me out, please

2388
07:44:40,939 --> 07:44:42,939
What the fuck are you talking about?

2389
07:44:46,060 --> 07:45:09,770
No, I need i'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Okay, I can't go in the main door. Where the hell is this other door?

2390
07:45:10,090 --> 07:45:14,520
I'm gonna stop these people

2391
07:45:14,520 --> 07:45:23,299
Classic, you know what? No, fuck this

2392
07:45:23,860 --> 07:45:25,979
Just run

2393
07:45:25,979 --> 07:45:28,790
Why would I fight anybody?

2394
07:45:29,029 --> 07:45:31,029
This guy nobody has a gun

2395
07:45:40,279 --> 07:46:03,419
How do I get out of here?

2396
07:46:09,479 --> 07:46:13,689
What's the where where is this person going the window?

2397
07:46:30,119 --> 07:46:31,400
Oh shit

2398
07:46:31,400 --> 07:46:33,240
They were doing that on purpose

2399
07:46:33,240 --> 07:46:40,490
He was npc walking and the other guy wasn't gonna ambush me get up there get up there

2400
07:46:44,150 --> 07:46:48,220
Shit, I can go up there. I can get up there. I can get up there. I can get up there

2401
07:46:48,220 --> 07:46:51,369
I can get up. I can get up there. I'm just gonna i'm just running

2402
07:46:53,770 --> 07:46:58,009
This game is terrible. I mean, it's it's I it's charming to me

2403
07:46:59,319 --> 07:47:02,599
I am very charmed by this. I have no we're not doing not next game. Not yet

2404
07:47:03,930 --> 07:47:12,250
No, not yet

2405
07:47:12,250 --> 07:47:18,169
I am not changing games until I get a like two by four or like a gun or something. You know what I mean?

2406
07:47:18,250 --> 07:47:19,610
I ain't just gonna

2407
07:47:19,610 --> 07:47:22,459
We're not just moving on not yet. Not worth it

2408
07:47:23,020 --> 07:47:26,979

08:05:55,959 --> 08:05:59,159
I'm not doing that with a camera on I would rather show my penis on stream

2514
08:06:11,900 --> 08:06:22,439
I wouldn't actually not at all. I would rather do that on camera. Oh they got him

2515
08:06:42,009 --> 08:06:44,009
Why did you say that I don't know

2516

Why am I so concerned? Well, i'm less concerned about like people spreading that

2521
08:07:31,159 --> 08:07:36,200
Why would I be less concerned? Well, I don't know my the logic. I don't have any logic for you. I don't know why

2522
08:07:36,919 --> 08:07:38,919
I have no idea what logic that was

2523
08:07:40,150 --> 08:07:43,430
No, they'll spread it because I have a funny face and they'll make like memes about it

2524
08:07:47,380 --> 08:07:51,220
What do you think would happen if you did the other thing? What do you think is going to happen?

2525
08:07:51,779 --> 08:08:03,819
How do I do that?
