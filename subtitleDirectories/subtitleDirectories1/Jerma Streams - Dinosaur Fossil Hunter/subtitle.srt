1
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:13,400
How you doing? I'm here. I'm here. I'm just finishing up something.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,500
Come on, don't don't dot dot dot me in a minute after starting the stream. I'm here. Trust me,

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:42,810
I'm here. I also had a dream about the stream, by the way, which is very important. I forgot,

4
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:50,390
I don't remember what the context was. I don't remember what it was. Something really embarrassing

5
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,509
happened. I don't, I was in, I was on camera and I was sitting here playing a game or something

6
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,759
and the first part is gone. But the second part is I remember I was so embarrassed by something,

7
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:06,650
like a really like, like not funny joke or something like that. And I like, I like went,

8
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:11,609
like pretended to think something on stream was funny. Like, oh shit, that joke didn't go well.

9
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,769
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, or something like that. And I just, I went like, oh my God,

10
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:22,489
what do I do? What do I do? So I like pretended to like fall forward and go like, oh, whoops,

11
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:28,010
I fell. And I was like on camera. You could see like in the monitor, like I was like down,

12
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:36,250
like I wasn't, I was off camera and I was like, oh guys, I fell down down here. Yeah. Oh man,

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:43,459
I'm gonna have to turn the stream off. I like fell down and everyone said I was full of shit.

14
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:52,019
Like the chat was like, liar, like full of shit. Get back on cam, liar, liar. And I thought,

15
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,420
I thought I did a pretty good job of like selling it. That like, oh, I fell down,

16
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,659
but like in my mind, I was like, this didn't, they didn't buy it. So now I did something that

17
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,459
people didn't like, but like I told a joke that people thought wasn't funny. So I tried to like

18
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:14,020
run away from the stream by pretending to fall down and like get hurt. And that was a disaster

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,780
because everyone here was like, no fucking way, liar. So that was a double embarrassment. And I

20
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,050
was like, what do I do now? Like, what am I, what am I even supposed to do right now? And then I

21
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:33,400
woke up. Imagine if like, I made a joke that was so bad that I pretended to fall out of the chair.

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,409
Oh yeah, guys, I fell down out of the chair. Like I'm hurt. I have to leave.

23
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:53,020
Anyways, he's going to do that this stream. No, it's funny because I have fallen out of the chair

24
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:02,009
like two or three years ago. I fell down on stream on the New Year's Eve stream from two years ago.

25
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,020
And it's not like, oh, I have to turn the stream off. I was, I was, I was fine.

26
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,580
Anyways, I was going to stream yesterday, but I kind of felt like shit. I'm honest.

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,259
I still kind of have a headache. I had a bad like migraine like headache yesterday.

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,419
And I didn't want to turn the stream on. And then in an hour, just be like,

29
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,539
sorry guys, I got to go. Cause that's happened before. So I figured why not just go today.

30
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,300
I feel better. I do feel, I feel better. I don't want to overdo it though.

31
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:48,219
So we'll see how I feel in a few hours. So I'm imagining we'll, we'll, we'll take a look,

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:57,430
see how I'm doing in like three to fourish hours right now. So I'll give you the plan.

33
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:06,710
The plan is as follows. Take notes day one today, this week. Well, it's technically the weekend,

34
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,349
but you know, whatever this seven day period of, you know, I haven't streamed in two or three days.

35
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:17,980
That's what we start our new period, our new streaming period. Today we're going to do

36
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:25,750
dinosaur fossil hunter for as long as I think it's fun. It looks pretty good. Actually,

37
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,740
it actually looks fun. Uh, after that, some point in the next couple of days,

38
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:40,259
we're going to play later alligator kind of a point and click puzzle game. Cute. Looks really

39
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,040
cute. It's really fun. Looks really interesting at some point, somewhere in the middle there,

40
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,439
or on that stream. I don't know. I'm going to play the house of the dead remake. That game

41
00:04:52,439 --> 00:05:00,730
is literally like 40 minutes, so I could probably do that at any point that I feel like it. And then

42
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,610
at some point this weekend, we're going to do some horror stuff. More of those little

43
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:13,560
short one to two hour horror games. I got blood wash and murder house. That's going to be this

44
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:28,839
weekend. There's your plan for the week. Excellent. Are you going to finish inscription? I am not

45
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,939
going to finish inscription on stream. I've got to, I've got to tell you something. I've done

46
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:44,889
something. I've, I played it off stream already. Yep. I already did. Sorry guys. I did. I did get

47
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:55,050
to the, I got to the third part. I have not continued since then without us. Yeah. Well,

48
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,589
some games, some games I would rather do off stream. I already, I talked about this for a little

49
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:07,910
bit, but let's go over it again. A lot of games that require a lot of focus and paying attention

50
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,670
and do, don't fuck up this hand because you're going to have to start over.

51
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,819
I really don't do well with those games on stream. My brain is just too, I can't, I'm just too

52
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,740
scattered talking to chat, looking over here, looking over there, looking over here. And then

53
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm like, oh shit, there's a guy that I'm playing a game. I have a lot of trouble with that. So I

54
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,860
would rather just play those kinds of games off stream. And by the way, I've, it was, it was,

55
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,410
it was pretty cool. It was pretty cool. I haven't beat the whole thing, but I got to the third part

56
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,250
and at the, okay, I'll be honest though. I got to give you my honest, what happened.

57
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:52,870
I got to the third part of inscription and kind of went, this is fucking cool, but I don't,

58
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,509
I don't know if, I don't know. I like, don't want to do it again. Does that, does that make sense?

59
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,850
Does anybody, does that make sense? When I say that, when I say like, I don't want to do it again,

60
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:15,209
I don't mean like the game. I mean like, I don't want to like do it again. Right. It's really cool

61
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:28,500
though. And when I say do it again, like, yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to, the games,

62
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,220
the game is crazy. I don't want to like spoil anything when anybody hasn't played it,

63
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,339
but I'm going to finish it. I'm more, I'm, I'm assumed that's the last or third part of the game.

64
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,240
I don't know if there's a fourth or fifth part of the game, but I know that I'm at like a third

65
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,910
portion of it. I don't want to do it again. You know what I mean? I don't want to do it again.

66
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,389
That's all you need to know. Anyway, so that, okay, that's your plan for the week. Oh, also

67
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,970
something important that I want to make sure everyone is aware of this too. So if you ever go

68
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,189
to an arcade, there's one real, we were talking in pre-stream about this, by the way, if you don't,

69
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:13,910
if you don't know, if you don't know anything about this stream, I show up to my stream 10

70
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:20,310
to 20 minutes late every single time, but I'm chatting in the pre-stream chat 20 to 30 minutes

71
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,790
before the stream starts every time. So I kind of, I kind of fuck myself over in a way because like,

72
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,629
I will hang out in chat for like 20 minutes before the stream and then I'll go get ready and I'll

73
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:37,110
those 20 to 30 minutes is how, where the stream starts. Right? So anyways, we were talking about

74
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,870
arcades and something that I think is really important for you to understand is that there's

75
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,110
only one way for you to understand if you're in a real arcade or not. Forget about like, oh,

76
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,470
what do you mean an arcade? No, just listen. If the arcade has the point blank arcade cabinet,

77
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,820
rest assured, you're in a real arcade. You can be like, all right, I'm in a real arcade.

78
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:14,679
That is the only way to tell, by the way, if they serve high strength alcohol, that what?

79
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:25,639
That's my, that's my determination, determine if I'm in a real arcade or not. You're gatekeeping

80
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:30,919
arcades. No, I'm just, everybody has their own version of what they consider to be like, all

81
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,679
right, I know this is, I'm in a place where I'm going to enjoy myself. This is a real arcade for

82
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:42,379
me. For me, it's point blank. For you, it might also be the X-Men arcade machine with six slots

83
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:50,730
that have the six slots on it. And it's two TVs, two big TVs are connected in the middle to each

84
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,250
other. And one of them is way fucking brighter than the other one and has way more contrast

85
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:06,330
and looks wicked fucked up. I know that's probably your indicator, but I have my own indicator.

86
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:17,129
That's my way to tell full story, bro. And don't even tell me, Oh dude, no, if it has an air hockey

87
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:23,720
machine. Oh my God, that's please. An air hockey machine is how an arcade wants you to think

88
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,799
they're a real arcade, right? They put that in there like, yeah, dude, we got air hockey here.

89
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:40,009
No, excuse me. That's like the way to make you think that it's a real arcade. What about house

90
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,649
of the dead? Oh, that's right. I'm going to play house of the dead as well. Wait, I already said

91
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:54,679
that. Air hockey hater. Okay. Casino Andy. Point blank is a light gun machine from like 20 years

92
00:10:54,679 --> 00:11:03,059
ago. It's not a slot machine. I would understand that argument. If I just told you, dude, you know

93
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:09,460
what I really love in the arcades? Just throwing dice in the air and hoping that I get a money

94
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:19,000
after I do it. Huh? I said a point blank. It's a light gun game. If there's a bowling alley there,

95
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,399
you know what bowling up a bowling alley? I think is Adam. Not a fan of that. We could spend a lot

96
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,279
of time doing this. I don't want to spend that much time doing this, but bowling alley being

97
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:40,659
in your arcade. That's just less room for arcade machines. In my opinion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

98
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:47,450
That's just how I personally feel. If you've got a, if you've got like 20 lanes of bowling

99
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,049
and it's like two thirds of your entire floor and the rest is an arcade. Oh man. You could have had,

100
00:11:55,049 --> 00:12:09,110
you could have had point blank one, two and three 20. I don't know. What about a roller rink? What

101
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,590
about a go-kart track? Remember you're gaslighting a lot of people. I'm not, I'm just telling you my

102
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:24,259
opinions. Okay. I didn't say you have to believe this too. I just said, I think I personally,

103
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:35,669
what I believe. What about a wrestling ring? That would be ridiculous. By the way, this is this,

104
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:41,529
this is the music I've been listening to this whole time. I think that's why I'm so ready to

105
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:54,860
tell you this. This has been blasting in both of my ears. What about laser tag? Look laser tag is

106
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,820
fine. Bowling alleys are fine. But if I go to the website and I look at the pictures of your

107
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,629
floor that you have and you do this, a bunch of like real estate angles to try to make the bathroom

108
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,190
look bigger than it looks, right? Like, oh, here's our arcade section. And it's like, whoa, look at

109
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:20,940
how big that looks. But there's like fucking eight machines there. No, like, okay. If you have enough

110
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,820
cabinets where it's like, all right, you've got enough arcade machines. Sure. Throw a bowling

111
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,980
alley in there if you want to. But if you call yourself an arcade and you got like fucking eight

112
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:42,549
arcade cabinets, I think that has to be a threshold. I'm sorry. This is the weirdest rant. It's not.

113
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:50,809
This is the German on eight five fucking whatever podcasts, but we just kind of talk about whatever

114
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:02,379
and it like zooms in on like the iTunes store that zooms in on like, like 40 reviews.

115
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:08,759
And, and I've got like two and a half stars and the podcast is like a hundred bucks,

116
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:26,019
but whatever podcast and the first like the most highly rated review or whatever is just like,

117
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,940
this guy didn't even talk about anything important. He got to the section where he was talking about

118
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,179
like how many arcade cabinets you have to have to be like the threshold to be allowed to be an arcade.

119
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:46,899
And I stopped listening and I requested a refund. Anyways, put the face cam on. All you face cam

120
00:14:46,899 --> 00:15:03,720
Andes. I didn't even tweet this. Did I? Did I tweet this? I thought I did. I guess not. Okay.

121
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:14,620
Well, there you go. Tweet. Tweet done. I got to use my Twitter more. It's so bad. It really is.

122
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,519
I need to do more tweets rather than I'm live.

123
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,559
But like, I don't want to, okay. I have a huge draft of tweets. I just write tweets and I don't

124
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:42,600
do, I just think that people are going to think I'm an idiot. This is, I'm going to read you every

125
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:53,190
few months we do this. I'm going to read you my drafts. Okay. No, no, no. Stop it. What, what you

126
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:00,710
doing my Wellington? No. What? Stop it. Stop. You donkey. What you doing? No. What you, my Wellington.

127
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:07,399
That's the last thing I wrote down. And then I don't know what this one is. This one says

128
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,929
wrestling referees are video game AI. I think you can probably break that one down.

129
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,100
Um, and then the next one is, I guess, I guess this one lost arc came out.

130
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,259
The only arc I care about is Noah's arc. Get out of my mentions and into a Bible.

131
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:39,370
I don't know what that one was about. Sometimes I just read, I don't know. Sometimes I just write

132
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:49,590
these down, but then like I only publish like going live at 6 PM. If it makes you feel better,

133
00:16:49,590 --> 00:17:01,289
everyone already thinks you're an idiot. Read that now. That lost arc came out like five months

134
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:12,579
ago. It's not going to be relevant at all. Maybe when there's DLC, I'll do it. Who cares?

135
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:19,539
The game came. I'm not. Okay. That would be like making it. It's so irrelevant. I can't.

136
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:31,210
It's too irrelevant. Next game. I haven't even started playing. By the way, I, for a second,

137
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,289
I thought this was like a roast beef. I forgot what game this was. I was like, oh,

138
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:41,940
this guy's got like a whole pot roast here. All right. Stop it. Let's go. You guys ready?

139
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,680
I'll turn, I'm going to turn it off if you're good. Only if you guys are good.

140
00:17:47,319 --> 00:18:03,000
Okay. So this is a game where you go. I was going to say you hunt dinosaurs,

141
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,099
but that's not what you do. Here with games presents dinosaur fossil hunter. Okay.

142
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,140
It's fully voice acted. By the way, the wind is fucking crazy right now. Can you hear that?

143
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:28,099
Wild right now. It's crazy here right now. All right. I already did some of these controls, but

144
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:34,410
here it's fucked up. It actually sounds like, it actually sounds like I'm going to like get blown

145
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,549
over. Oh, happy mother's day to all the mothers out there. Oh, by the way, call your mother,

146
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:48,680
please call your mother. Is that good? I got to put both headphones in. I might want to turn it

147
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,529
up. Art Andy and that guy permanently. I never want to see his fucking name ever again for a

148
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:10,490
minute. Okay. Let's go. All right. So this is my, is this my museum? Okay. Controls, tip panels,

149
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:18,380
prestige roadmap. What is the prestige road? I can't even open it. Okay. Left and right. Okay.

150
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:26,730
Your museum sucks. No, it doesn't actually. Is it T-Rex? I thought the T-Rex was way bigger than

151
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:46,619
this. And this here is like 50 feet tall. Cool. It's 50 feet tall. Okay. So I think this is where

152
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:55,259
I gotta go. Museum workshop. Okay. I think this is probably a tutorial. Platinum patron of science,

153
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:05,079
Kendra. Gold patron of science, Jack Renshaw. This is, all right. We're slowly running out

154
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:15,990
of space in the museum. Oh, I thought I had to do this. I'd love to draw dinosaurs. I was like,

155
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:23,670
this is not the game I thought it was going to be. Oh, I do have to do this. All right. Let's go for

156
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:59,210
it. Give me the pencil. Oh shit. Honestly, I'm telling you right now, this is, this is, this is,

157
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:07,220
this kid's ready for upper management. It's just like, oh yeah. It's just like these, these little

158
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:26,779
dot to dot puzzles just to bore, bore your child. Okay. Is that good? I got it. Is that it? Oh,

159
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:37,700
that's it. Okay. Next drawing. You missed the front leg. I just was, I was just coloring it in. Okay.

160
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:54,410
Next drawing. New draw. Oh no, I have to, I'm doing it. I have to do it again. E? Okay. Oh wait. I

161
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:46,180
can, oh, next one. All right. So let me do it right. Let me actually do it right. Why do I feel

162
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:56,039
like kids in school, like probably do this stuff? You know, like sometimes you just look over and

163
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,579
you see like, Hey, come sub to my Twitch. Like, Hey, you can find me over here at Twitch. I feel

164
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:16,539
like, I feel like kids probably do this. Oh, like they're like Twitter. What kid has a Twitter?

165
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:26,059
Do kids have Twitter? They shouldn't. They shouldn't. Do they? No, they don't. Do they?

166
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,750
Kids don't, kids don't have Twitter. I hope they don't. I missed these dots. So I'll get it.

167
00:23:33,750 --> 00:24:03,720
All right. Continue. What the fuck am I doing out here? Oh, there's a sprint. Wait, I'm supposed to

168
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:21,400
be eight years old right now. Where, where's the, where's my supervision? Okay. Right. Left mouse

169
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:30,859
button. Pick up and inspect. Right is drop or hold to throw. All right. I found my first fossil here.

170
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:42,150
What are all the car sounds? Okay. I'm just in my backyard, right? And I'm in, I'm just like,

171
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:56,329
it's imagination time. I'm imagining all of this. Okay. Holy shit. That's why we're like

172
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:06,680
$50,000. Okay. So this is, I can rotate it. I can rotate it. Oh, no, I can't. I lost it half a year

173
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:13,160
later. I mean lost it. At the age of 14, nearly all I could think about was putting together and painting

174
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:20,250
dinosaur models. I was getting better at it. All right. That kid, this kid got into the wood stain

175
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,500
and did this. Like, I, excuse me. Like, where'd you get the stain to do that? This one comes with

176
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:32,329
the manual. It's dead simple. It comes with the manual. All right. Hold on. Let me do a little bit of,

177
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:53,480
let me do a little grease action here. 14. All right. So here we go. So I get to do this.

178
00:25:54,279 --> 00:26:02,470
Oh, this is cool. Rotate, pick up part, drop part. Okay. So I just have to go this way. All right.

179
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:13,930
So here we go. I got like a, this is easy. No, pick it up. That's a great sound effect by the way.

180
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:43,049
Why is my nose so itchy? Ooh. All right. So I got a brontosaurus. This one's tough. Oh, fuck. Okay.

181
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:51,240
Can I like spin this around? All right. Well, very obviously this is here. What if I don't have the

182
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:16,579
drawing? Yeah. Easy. Easy. Do I get to paint it too? Why does this 10 year old have a voice like this?

183
00:27:16,579 --> 00:27:29,000
He's remembering. He's reminiscing. Okay. Well, this is definitely where the head goes.

184
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:39,640
Oh, that I can rotate it. All right. So this is where the head goes. These are the arms,

185
00:27:39,640 --> 00:28:00,759
the tail. All right. This is the big part of the tail. Yep. No, that didn't work. Let me

186
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:16,250
just do all the stuff. I know where it goes first. Hey, this is a leg. That's like, there's like a

187
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:33,900
thigh wrong way. I know these are, this is tough. I don't know. Like this. Yep. Okay. Keep going.

188
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:55,000
It's like a life is strange soundtrack. Is that right? Yeah, I got it. I'm good. Maybe I could

189
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,970
use more practice and build one of them again. That's difficulty level. I don't need to do that.

190
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:10,250
I know what I'm doing. A couple of years later, the money I had received as a reward in that

191
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:19,480
competition turned out to be of an invaluable help. I mean, I got some money. Adventure of a

192
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:27,289
lifetime in your twenties. I think it's possible. I was exactly 20 years old when I found an article

193
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:32,329
about a paleontological group in a newspaper. It turned out they needed volunteers who were

194
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:36,650
willing to work in the north of the country. It was a long shot, but I didn't want to miss

195
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,049
such a great opportunity. Oh, for some reason, I thought dinosaurs like existed in this world.

196
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,599
See like the front page, like front page of the news, man, like the T-Rex is back.

197
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:58,140
Stay in your house. What would, what would people do if there was a front page on like number one

198
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:05,910
on Reddit, like top of Reddit, top of every news website, CNN, Fox news, ABC. If it was like T-Rex

199
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:14,549
is a back, what would happen? And it was like a big roaring T-Rex. Like that's like the pictures

200
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:25,450
of it on Reddit. I don't know. Okay. Gameplay basics. What would, would you like leave your

201
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:33,829
house? Like front, the top front page of Reddit, over 50 T-Rexes have been spotted in various

202
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:39,720
cities across America. Are you going to leave? Are you going to like leave? What do you do?

203
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:48,599
I think I'd be scared. Okay. Gameplay tips, important interactive objects. Let's just go

204
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:55,380
over this real quick. You know, it's a video. I'm going to give the dev plus one full letter grade.

205
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:03,829
You just show me, show me what, show me. Don't tell me, show me. Yep. Gameplay tips up a right

206
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:11,269
corner. Read them on the tablet. Okay. F1. Got it. Look at this. Absolutely perfect tutorial.

207
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:20,220
What about this one? Important object display description in the lower left corner. Okay.

208
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,099
Look at this. I honestly, like, I'm not kidding. This is like a perfect tutorial.

209
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:29,319
Okay. Third hint will be in the color of the pointer. Okay. So yeah, just like this

210
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:35,609
information on the bottom. Easy. Icons on the compass hide with growing distance.

211
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:40,859
Okay. Just like that on the map on your tablet, you can select an object or place that where you

212
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:48,730
want to go. All right. This would have taken a AAA game, like three hours to tell me this stuff.

213
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,730
Okay. Then when you unlock new locations, use the travel tab on your tablet to move to another

214
00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:01,450
location. Good. Okay. So it's like right there. I'm a day in the trip. You can select the time

215
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,130
of day car. You want to make your cars are in this game. You just got two full letter

216
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:11,559
grades in one minute. If all of you said this game was like a C, it just became an A minus

217
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:22,630
just because of the last 15 seconds. Okay. So cool. Let's go. So I can drive, I drive around.

218
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:30,009
I got my tablet. Welcome to the mining area. A few weeks ago, miners came across something that

219
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:34,410
appears to be dinosaur remains. We managed to get the mine closed until the matter is dealt with

220
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:38,329
as neither the workers nor the board of directors is happy about the lockdown.

221
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:45,019
Okay. We got to act fast. Your job is relatively easy. Head to the area marked on your map and

222
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:49,099
leave no stone unturned. The area is marked on your radar as well, so you shouldn't have any

223
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:53,339
problems finding it. The off-road car parked nearby is fueled and ready. We hope your work

224
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:58,140
will be fruitful. With your help, we should be able to finally complete the full skeleton

225
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:02,059
for our new museum. That's a fun one to say when you do like the radio voice

226
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:08,859
of the missing bones that we're looking for our hip bone, right arm bone, and a vertebra.

227
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:13,880
All right, let's go. Let's go. Turn it up a little bit. It's not that loud.

228
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:21,460
Okay. So we've got two tools. This is my flashlight. I've got a drone.

229
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:47,240
Does this have gas? How do I get out of here? Okay, let's go. So I need to go where on the map?

230
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:59,160
Two by four, four by four. Why do I have like a bunch of moving stuff? All right. Use the horn.

231
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:10,070
Nice. This is the music. Okay. So where am I going? Where's the map? Okay. I got to go

232
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:21,699
over there on the right. All right. So turn around. They have like a street. All right.

233
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:32,340
You can go kind of fast. Uh-oh. It's like, wait, don't go so fast. Hold on. Removing obstacles.

234
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,780
Remove lying tree trunks with a chainsaw and use sledgehammer to break rocks. Note the color

235
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,940
of the interactive cursor when using tools. When it is green, you can work. Ooh, can I find stuff

236
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,190
in there? If you find stuff in a place you can't get out of, use R to reset your character. I think

237
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:55,559
I'm about to be in that part. There's an excavation equipment in your car. After using it to secure

238
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:00,730
the excavation area, you'll need to get another set of equipment from the hub. Don't forget about

239
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,969
this when you go on your next fossil site search. In hard to reach and muddy terrain, use the four

240
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:15,269
by four drive. You can reset the car by pressing R2. All right. Just hit like it is dead.

241
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:27,780
Like I'm dead. Like I'm, it's over. That's it. All right. I got to do this, right?

242
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:41,239
Like I missed the sledgehammer. Cool. All right. So how do I get this? How do I get this out of the

243
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:51,110
way? Just going to pick it up. I have to keep cutting it. How many, how many pieces do I need?

244
00:35:51,750 --> 00:36:17,159
Can I just drive over it? How do I pick it up? Oh, there we go. Nobody else works here, right?

245
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:32,389
That's why I shouted the windshield. I don't do that with any bones. That would be bad, right?

246
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:40,860
This, I love this music. It's so like epic. Okay. So I got to go that way. There's the dig site.

247
00:36:41,500 --> 00:37:12,099
I put it in four by four. Yeah. Four wheel drive. All right. I can't go that way. Maybe I can. You

248
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:15,539
see, they never show this in the car commercials because this is what happens if you were to do

249
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:47,610
this. That didn't do anything. Okay. There we go. Four wheel drive. Get through the mud.

250
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:55,300
I don't want to push the car. I'm fine. All right. Back into two wheel drive.

251
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:08,420
Let's go. Use a hammer. All right. Our need to have all wheels grounded to get. Oh, I thought

252
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:23,829
the other wheels were all gone. This is a big cheese. It kind of is like a big piece of cheese,

253
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:30,949
isn't it? How strong is this guy? Oh no fucking way. Hercules couldn't even do that in the movie.

254
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:44,150
That would be so funny if there was sound effects. It was like, I definitely cannot pick this one up.

255
00:38:44,150 --> 00:39:01,179
You big? Make your own sounds. I can, okay. I don't, I can get out of this. Is there any

256
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:16,570
valuables here too? Like with it, can I like sift for gold? Okay. Here we go. We're here.

257
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:33,210
Now I got to get out and I've got to do some excavation. Oh, it's this way. Okay. Is it near

258
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:44,869
the tree? All right. It's somewhere over here. Bring your car. Oh, this is just like Minecraft.

259
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:54,469
Not really. This is dinosaur poop simulator. I don't think you did. The dinosaur poo didn't

260
00:39:54,469 --> 00:40:17,590
fossilize. Wasn't it absorbed into the fucking ground? Did it? Okay. Here we go. So what? Oh,

261
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:40,119
I have to fuck that. Secure the area. Oh, it's just doing it. This is funny. Where's he going?

262
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:48,460
Oh, just, should I skip it? Dude, I'm sorry. This game blows. You know, it's, I can tell you,

263
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:55,659
I can tell you about these like, these are like five minute Andes. Okay. It's so it's been like

264
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:12,440
15 minutes. You should play a different. No, stop. Oh, wait. How big is this area? Oh, okay.

265
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:29,590
Play checkers. No checkers sucks. Okay. Here we go. It does check. Okay. Checkers. Look,

266
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:36,500
I don't like chess either. I'm going to, it's not like, I think I look checkers is not a bad game,

267
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:45,860
but checkers chess, any game where I have to sit down like across somebody and move little pieces

268
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,900
on like a game board and go against somebody else. I don't care. I'm, it bores the absolute

269
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,139
fuck out of me. I would rather like just go like roll down a hill. You know what I mean?

270
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:02,039
I don't want to look, I don't want to play chess. I want to like roll down the hill.

271
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,679
I don't like want to play chess. I, but Hey, let's play chess, dude. Oh, just like,

272
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,869
please. Like I want to do anything else. Anything but chess, anything, but checkers or chess.

273
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:14,949
I don't know. There's some like really like high brain people that they get a lot of enjoyment

274
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:19,610
from that shit. You're really analytical and you like problem solving and stuff. And that's

275
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,210
awesome. That's really cool. I'm glad you have the capability to do that. I just want to roll

276
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:34,460
down a hill. I don't, I've always tried. My brother was into chess and he really wanted somebody to

277
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,469
play with and he would just checkmate me every fucking 10 seconds. Like he was just trying to

278
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:45,579
find someone to play with and he'd be like, Hey man, let's, you want to play chess? I was like,

279
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,920
yeah. And I would just sit there and I would just, I only, the only thing I knew what to do in chess

280
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,019
was move the pawns. I didn't know how to do anything else. So he would just, I would move

281
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:05,030
my pawns up sometimes two spaces, sometimes one for no reason. And they would like and checkmate

282
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:12,280
me in like five minutes. This happened to every time. I've got to feel bad looking back because

283
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:18,599
he really did just really want to play and like the internet didn't exist. Right. So you couldn't

284
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:23,880
just like, Oh, go play chess against like a computer. You can just right now you losing

285
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:33,690
viewers. Good. Right now you can open up any app, any website. You can literally go play chess right

286
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:39,719
now in literally on five seconds from right now. I kind of feel bad for the people that really

287
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:48,579
wanted to do that kind of stuff, but they just have no, you didn't have any access to it.

288
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:55,139
All right. There's your story. In the excavation area, use the GPR to find the stones hidden

289
00:43:55,139 --> 00:44:04,789
underground. Ooh. Okay. Dig in the soil and sand with a shovel. Pay attention to the color of the

290
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:10,489
cursor that indicates where you can use the tool. All right. So you got to find the rock, dig,

291
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,500
use the pickaxe to search the rocky ground. Pay attention to the color of the cursor that indicates

292
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,860
where you can use the tool. Sick. Visual inspection at this stage will help you identify stones of

293
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:33,159
other geologic periods. You can remove them quickly. Let's go. I love stories, people happy.

294
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:46,789
Losing viewers equals spinning out the week. Did you hear that noise? That was like, oh,

295
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:58,090
okay. Grab a palette. What do I do with this? Oh, there's no fossils in here. Okay. I get it.

296
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:10,820
All right. Here we go. Now we got to open up the machine. That is this thing here. All right. Find

297
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:18,780
a good place for exploration and scan it. All right. Scanning. Is it on the map? No, just somewhere

298
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:34,010
here. Scanning. This is a bunch of bullshit. What's going to happen is that somebody told

299
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:40,070
me to come out here and do this. There's nothing. There's not going to be anything here. This is

300
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:46,579
like this way. Somebody wanted to get rid of me for a few hours. All of a sudden, like all

301
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:53,530
the sprinkler system is going to turn on and just get me like soaking wet. And I'm going to be like,

302
00:45:54,659 --> 00:46:04,739
fucking pieces of shit. This is not right. Yeah, Dave, go there and go look for dinosaur bones.

303
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:18,260
Where? There's nothing here. How do I scan? I just go out here. There's nothing in this place.

304
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:39,000
Place, place flag. Where is this place? Go to the dirt mound. Oh my God. What? There everything's

305
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,099
this whole thing is a dirt mound. Oh, you mean this, you mean the fresh dirt. All right. Whatever.

306
00:46:48,099 --> 00:47:21,190
That looks pretty good. Oh, all right. Mark these two spots. Mark it here. Right here. Okay.

307
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:41,219
There's a lot of fossils here. What about there? No. What's your guys favorite dinosaur? Mine's

308
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:59,429
the chicken. Look it up. All right. I think I got enough. So now I got to dig at these spots.

309
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:29,699
How far down do I go? Oh, I got it. Oh shit. I can't move. I'm going to get rid of this crap.

310
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:38,699
All right. I, okay. Be careful. I get, I got to dig that out. How do I, is it, can I get it?

311
00:48:38,699 --> 00:48:59,829
Can I just pull it out? Put the chainsaw away. How do I get this out? Dude, there's probably like

312
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:17,750
10 dinosaur bones in here. Okay. I get it. I pick it up. Find first. Inspect the stone.

313
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:31,369
How do I inspect it? Dude, stop digging. Hold on. How do I inspect this?

314
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:37,099
Inspect the stone. How do I do that? Pick up, use, inspect. Right? That's what I'm trying to do.

315
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:53,510
I need to do more pickaxe. Oh shit. All right. Here we go. Fossils emit small amounts of radiation.

316
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:00,809
That was a bad one. That wasn't, that was not a funny one. No, I didn't. I'll do it again. I'll

317
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:08,059
do it better. That one was not as good either. I'll try it one more time. Oh, this, wait,

318
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:12,780
radiation? That was a good one. Use that one instead. That one, that was actually a pretty

319
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,019
good one. The first two were fucking cringe and awful. All right. This allows us to use the

320
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:22,329
Geiger counter to search for them. It will be indicated. All right. Cool. None of those.

321
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:30,039
That third one was fine. Use a towel to remove mud from the stone. Okay. And then we can identify

322
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:44,099
the species. This is cool. This is cool. All right. Let's go. I said bunker ass the first time.

323
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:58,309
Cringe. There's no bones in this rock? Oh, I can't get out of here. Hold on. What do you mean

324
00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:07,019
there's no bones in this rock? Oh, there are fossils in that little one. You need boneless

325
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:19,239
rocks. You don't want to have, you want boneless buffalo rocks? That's so stupid. I love it.

326
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:26,139
Okay. Prepare for transport. Use plaster to protect fragile fossils. This is so much, this is,

327
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:36,940
this is cool. You have to pack it into a, place the plaster stone in a shipping crate.

328
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:45,610
Okay. And then you put it into a crate. You're going to bring the necessary amount of crates

329
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,659
and then place the boxes with the fossils in your car and transport them to the hub.

330
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:58,809
Transport. That small chest can be transported by passenger cars. For large, you need a truck. Okay.

331
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:20,900
Park your vehicle. Okay. I got it. Big money. I can't move though. I can't get, I'm stuck. I

332
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:47,880
can't move. It's R, right? I can't get unstuck. R. Get me the fuck out of here. All right. I'm

333
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:55,909
good. But I want, I need to check the other ones too. Why did I not bring a stepladder?

334
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:10,260
Okay. I got to make a path. What'd I put with that? Let me, let me do the thing with this,

335
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:22,119
this one right here, right? All right. This is it. So let's look at it. Okay. Yep. There's bones in

336
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:41,739
there. Plaster it up. Make sure we keep it safe. Okay. I got a message. Evacuation. Oh, nevermind.

337
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:52,119
Yeah. The, been secured. Yep. Transport it. Okay. Yep. Okay. And now I got to put this in a box

338
00:53:52,119 --> 00:54:06,219
over here. Why are you putting a cast on it? Okay. Yes. Okay. Unknown species, unknown bone.

339
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:16,940
How many can I fit in here? Oh my God. That, what the hell was that sound? Let's get this shit out

340
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:38,170
of me. Okay. Wait, there's more of stones. I can fit one more in there. All right. This is fun. I

341
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:47,619
want to do this more. In my, uh, this thing. Can I eventually get a bigger car? Where are all my

342
00:54:47,619 --> 00:55:11,639
markers? Oh, did you just hit that Yonki Splonky? You got it, man. All right. Let me clear this out

343
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:20,329
because I don't want to get stuck like I just did. Dude, we missed you. I haven't gone anywhere

344
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:28,010
because I haven't hit the Yonki Splonky in like seven months. You know, there's other dances

345
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:31,369
besides the Yonki Splonky, right? You know that there's other things to, there's other movements

346
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:41,400
you can do with your body. You know that, right? Is that a fossil? I don't know. Okay. There was

347
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:55,539
another one here. Where is it? Let me check these. Does this have any fossils in it? That's passive

348
00:55:55,539 --> 00:56:06,250
aggressive Andy right there. Oh, that's fine. Oh, you said it's fine. Oh, you said it's fine.

349
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:21,449
That's fine. That's okay. Sure. Oh, that's fine. Whatever you say. No dinosaur bones in there.

350
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:43,449
Oh, whatever. All right. Let me, there's other ones here and this one, the guy flies an avatar.

351
00:56:43,449 --> 00:57:07,800
All right. Let's identify these. Take that up. There's gotta be one in here, right? That out of

352
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:21,429
here. Excuse me. This out of here. I don't want to confuse you with another one. He's gone. They

353
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:45,670
look at the CCTV footage. Why did he do that? Why would he do that? What was he doing? All right.

354
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:55,699
Let's take a look. Nope. Nope. Three in a row. What about this one?

355
00:57:57,269 --> 00:58:13,860
In go. All right. Get this out of here. Break this one up. Good. Get rid of it. See you later.

356
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:25,289
All right. So what's in here? We got two stones now. All right. I have to be honest with you.

357
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:30,199
Turn off the music. Not yet. Not until I'm sick of it. The first like 20 minutes of this game,

358
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:36,360
I thought we're going to be just like, like a piece of shit. Um, I am over the last like 30

359
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,659
minutes have slowly been going. This is actually going to be probably pretty cool. This is actually

360
00:58:40,659 --> 00:58:45,590
going to be kind of fun. Like I was like, this could be, I don't know if I'm going to like this.

361
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:50,039
I think I'm actually going to really like this, especially when you start like painting the

362
00:58:50,039 --> 00:59:12,820
dinosaur bones and stuff. This looks like cornbread and I wait, I can do three. I can put one on top

363
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:21,400
too. All right. I'm going to get another one. One can go up top. All right. Let's keep this one area

364
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:44,699
here. Oh, we got it. Please turn the music off. I'll just wait. You know, this is making me like

365
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:49,880
into it for a minute. I'll get bored of it in like 15 more minutes. Trust me. Don't worry.

366
00:59:49,880 --> 01:00:07,780
Can I get rid of this? There's some shit right here. This one, what does it even down here?

367
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:23,449
This one here. All right. Let's see. Any of these have anything in it? Get that out of here.

368
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:36,760
Nothing? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh, there's nothing here at all. I did this.

369
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:52,940
Okay. I'm an idiot. Where's the, over there. There's nothing there. How come you like boring

370
01:00:52,940 --> 01:01:06,500
games? Not everything has to have like machine gunfire. Okay. Not every game needs to have

371
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:18,980
machine gunfire. Okay. Every video game does not have to have, it doesn't have to have it

372
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:42,949
be an enjoyable experience. Plus I'm a boring fucking person. So there is your answer. Dude,

373
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:47,989
those are the, uh, dude. Oh wow. Like I wonder what his life is like when he's not streaming.

374
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:57,500
I am a boring fucking guy. Okay. Um, I think it was last night. I fell asleep. I had my iPad

375
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,260
and I fell asleep too. This is like kind of crazy. This is why I had like a nightmare.

376
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,199
I was watching a showcase, like a Halloween convention showcase where they show all like the

377
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:12,199
animatronics and shit. And I fell asleep to it and it autoplayed like five years of their convention.

378
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:21,210
Like if you scroll through these videos, it's like, oh, that was the biggest Halloween

379
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:26,409
convention or something. And it's like a huge thing. And they showcase all the new

380
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:37,659
animatronics and Halloween scary stuff. Right. And I just sitting there, dude, like this, just like,

381
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:43,210
I'm not doing anything else. Right. But if you scroll through, it was like five straight years

382
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:50,550
of their convention and people going to it, like hours of videos. And I shit you not almost every

383
01:02:50,550 --> 01:03:01,909
10 to 15 seconds. You hear. It's like this, this like fucking face peeled off zombie going like this.

384
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:14,519
It was literally the whole video. And I was, I felt I slept to that.

385
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:33,210
Was anything in here? They all do that too. When do you, okay. The, I, all those like crazy

386
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:41,130
animatronics, they all do that like really strange like movements. It's just so unsettling. It's so

387
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:50,570
scary. And I make this reference to you too. Animatronics, like the Halloween ones where it's

388
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:55,130
like the ghoul that like moves and just kind of goes at you. It reminds me of like Dark Souls

389
01:03:55,130 --> 01:04:02,119
enemies. They're just these mindless, brainless things that just, I'm getting you now. Like here

390
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:08,019
I come. That's why Dark Souls is so scary. We talked about that when I was playing Elden Ring,

391
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:16,139
but all the From Software AI, it's just, I'm killing you. I'm killing you. I don't care about

392
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:20,699
anything else. I don't give a shit about anything else. I, my programming is just get that fucking

393
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:26,840
guy right now. It doesn't, there is no like, oh, he's running back off a little. Nope. It's just

394
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:35,909
until I get you. It's horrifying. It's like a nightmare. It's a dream. That's why those

395
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:43,219
things are so scary. They just don't stop. That's why Michael Myers was scary. Michael Myers didn't

396
01:04:43,219 --> 01:04:49,219
do anything. Like I could probably sprint, punch Michael Myers in the face and knock him out and

397
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:54,019
he'd be dead. You know what I mean? Like I could probably like full sprint, fucking smash him in

398
01:04:54,019 --> 01:05:01,780
the head. Like right here. He'd just be like, but it would take one punch and it's right here.

399
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,500
And he would, his head would explode. I'm telling you his head would explode,

400
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:12,860
but no, because he's just like, just walks forward and has no emotion. He just has like an AI that's

401
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:17,750
like, go get that person. Just walk at them. That's why it was just, holy shit. What the

402
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:29,929
fuck is this terrifying thing in this one? All right. Where was I digging? I completely forgot.

403
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:34,250
We started talking about Halloween stuff, but yeah, I was sleeping to that. It is every 15 seconds.

404
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:40,489
You just hear screaming. No wonder I had a fucking nightmare. I could have turned auto play off, man.

405
01:05:40,489 --> 01:05:52,119
It's seriously, but I always just forget to cause I'm logged in. How many pieces of furniture do you

406
01:05:52,119 --> 01:06:02,460
have? I don't know. Like I have a chair, two chairs, I think table. I don't know. I got five

407
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:20,469
pieces of furniture, maybe. Fuck. I said, this is going to be a chill stream. I say that every time

408
01:06:20,469 --> 01:06:25,670
and then I've, I don't know. I'm like fucked up. I'm going to give myself another headache.

409
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:36,059
Like I had yesterday. All right. Let's get this sealed up. You need to inspect it first. Oh shit.

410
01:06:36,059 --> 01:06:49,829
I'm not inspecting it. That's right. Perform a visual inspection. Oh fuck. I like plastered

411
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:59,320
those without knowing what it was. Oh shit. Well, Jerry, you, this is great. You found these fossils,

412
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:09,559
but you like mummified them and we're never going to know what they are. Thanks. Okay. Well,

413
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:15,130
I know what it is. Are there any more? All right. I get it now. Next time I'll be out there. So this

414
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:36,650
is a head, like a skull. What's this music? This is, this song is called the river doth flow.

415
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:58,500
I forget the artist, but it's the river. Oops. The river, the river doth flow. I have no idea.

416
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:02,760
Okay. So I did it. Now I got to get out of here. I got to go back to the

417
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,989
campsite. I probably should actually be careful. You can probably dump this.

418
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:15,429
I'm going to do the right thing. There's no way in fuck, you know, what the word doth means. It

419
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:41,539
means does or do. How's that wrong? Yeah. Like, oh, whether thou doth go or not, whether you will go

420
01:08:41,539 --> 01:09:09,369
or do or not to be or not to be, thou doth the question. Don't crash into a rock. What does it

421
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:13,130
actually mean then? How's that wrong? But what does it actually mean? What does doth mean?

422
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,729
Does it mean like to do, like to go, like doth, like to do, does?

423
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:26,180
It does. Yeah. What are you talking about? Don't make me seem like I'm an idiot.

424
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:40,260
Listen to this music. This music got cooler. Can I put this down and open it up and see what's in

425
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:59,380
there? All right. Open this. I can't open it. Unknown species. Just throw it over there? No,

426
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:04,779
I can't. All right. Open tablet to leave this area and transport the findings to your museum.

427
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:19,590
OK, I can hire a worker. OK, so I can go back to the museum. How do I?

428
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:30,630
Do you want to send the crates? Yes. Yes, I do. What does doth mean? Tell me or I'll turn the

429
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:33,750
stream off right now. I'm going to turn my stream off. I'm going to hit end stream. I'm

430
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:42,250
meant to hovering over it right now. What does doth mean? Three, two, one means do. Thank you

431
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,930
for saving the stream. Lucky, lucky, lucky.

432
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:55,609
Preoccupied with collecting and preparing dinosaur bones.

433
01:10:56,409 --> 01:11:01,859
When I arrived at the museum's lab, it was time to start cleaning what I had found.

434
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:06,500
It was a fascinating experience. It required a lot of time and attention.

435
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:19,460
The results always worth the effort. There's a lot in this game. It's fun. OK,

436
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:26,789
moving the crates around with box cleaning station. That's it. It's so visual. That's why

437
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:32,420
I've been able to blow through this tutorial. Look at this. Remove plaster and extract fossil

438
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:40,949
from the stone using the available tools. I almost said avalanche. Oh, after extracting

439
01:11:40,949 --> 01:11:45,109
the fossil, make a decision who should clean this set of bones, you or the museum employee.

440
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:53,880
Somebody else is going to do it. If you clean the bones by hand, pay attention to the game

441
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,159
controls in the upper left corner. Here you'll find some useful features such as focus mode

442
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:06,329
and highlighting of uncleaned areas. Oh, that just scared the shit out of me.

443
01:12:06,329 --> 01:12:25,159
I thought there was a monster in here. What is this thing? Why am I skiing? OK, cool. Get off.

444
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:38,699
All right, what do we got in here? Unknown bone, unknown species. Let's take a look.

445
01:12:40,550 --> 01:13:14,979
All right, let's clean it. Where do I get this off? It's a loot box.

446
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:30,840
Do I just carve it this way? Oh, there we go. OK, so now I'm looking for the where was the fossil?

447
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:39,369
Right there. Watch out. Don't break it. Don't break it. Can I break it if I'm not careful?

448
01:13:45,720 --> 01:14:00,649
I'll clean it. I want to do it. Clean it. Whoa. Oh, shit, I broke it. I think I broke it. Did I

449
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:35,109
break it? Cleaning scope. Oh, wait, you can see magnified. That's funny. I need to rotate this.

450
01:14:35,109 --> 01:15:15,720
All right. So what is that? Remember, remember that one? OK, this is going to take too long.

451
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:29,510
These just look like the dinosaur chicken nuggets. Well, they are based in reality.

452
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:47,500
Send fossil to preparation room. Based, based. Pod watchers skip. Pod watchers don't listen to

453
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,619
don't you got to let somebody dictate what you should do. You know, listen to one person dictate

454
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:59,340
what you should do with like what you do with your time. Think about that. I let somebody tell

455
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:16,010
you how to dictate your time, right? Stay. Listen to that guy. All right. Just painting some barbecue

456
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:30,229
sauce on these. Is it ready? Now what? Whoa. Am I supposed to do this?

457
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:41,800
There's so much going into this. What is going on? Look at how much is going into this.

458
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:50,300
There's something kind of like therapeutic about doing what I'm doing, though. This is kind of I

459
01:16:50,300 --> 01:17:14,729
like this and I upgrade the tools. Are there upgrades in this game? You're ruining them.

460
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:37,979
Dinosaur ribs. Those aren't done. That's not done. All right. What's the next step?

461
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:50,840
When I drop them into the hot vegetable oil, we got a joint cooking up dinosaur bones like

462
01:17:50,840 --> 01:18:02,949
you wouldn't believe full of flavor. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

463
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:13,460
I've been coming here for 25 years. That's Don Stevenson. He got the joint from his granddad.

464
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:25,529
So what made you want to eat dinosaur bones? Well, my grandfather was a paleontologist and

465
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:30,550
one day he's out there decided to take a little taste snack on some of the bones he had found

466
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:35,079
and realized that there was still some pretty delicious marrow in there and some meat still

467
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:44,600
there. Well, he opened up this place and I've been taking it all over ever since. He said among us.

468
01:18:45,560 --> 01:19:25,369
All right. Spin it around. This. Oh my God. This is what it takes to do this.

469
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:42,680
Just spray paint them. Whoa. Remember you'd make a bad dentist. It's really simplified, dude.

470
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:51,850
Millions of year old fossils. So what you got cooking in here? Well, these are T-Rex legs.

471
01:19:54,359 --> 01:20:07,260
Only eight of these exist on earth. Oh wow. So you marinate those? Yeah. Water. Water from the sink.

472
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:10,619
He goes, he's like goes and dips his finger in the water from the sink in the bucket and goes,

473
01:20:13,779 --> 01:20:24,300
buddy. Whoa. It's like, that's just, that's just sink water. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.

474
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:30,600
Take it from this, put it on this into the skeleton or store it in the museum store room.

475
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:39,539
After cleaning and collecting and connecting the skeleton pieces, you can proceed to complete the

476
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:44,340
entire dinosaur. When the knowledge tab on your tablet becomes available, you look in the ability

477
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:58,039
to manage dinosaur skeletons. Really? And you can move it into an exhibit. That's crazy. Okay.

478
01:20:58,039 --> 01:21:08,500
Design mode. Oh shit. I don't know where this goes. I don't know where this is supposed to go.

479
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:39,079
Oh, now I guess I do. Do I have the whole thing? I do. What the hell is this? Um, I'll take it.

480
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:46,500
Don't drop it. Oh, look, it's right here. Oh, whoa. Okay. So I, I'm assuming the other stuff

481
01:21:46,500 --> 01:22:06,739
is the head and the legs. Drop it and it just shatters. Oh, it's a, it's Bob's dino grill calling.

482
01:22:06,739 --> 01:22:09,699
I heard you dropped a dinosaur bone and shattered on the ground.

483
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:42,220
Mind if I come, come take that for you for like $40. I've been eating here for 25 years. Yeah. So

484
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:48,619
you got a statistic for us, don't you? Don't you, Bob? Yes, I do. Yes. Every single person that's

485
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:53,340
ever eaten here has gotten sick. Every single one, every single one, every single one guy.

486
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:11,829
I think this is the Virta, the vertebrae, but I have to manually clean this. Don't I? All right.

487
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:36,819
We're going to do the speed run. Somebody said it'd be a bad dentist. Did you see what I just did?

488
01:23:37,460 --> 01:24:04,390
I got to get a worker. I need a worker. Why's your face cam shaking? Um, because the wind,

489
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:22,550
it's really windy here in Vegas. I told you guys. Jesus. No, it's because my mouse is on my desk

490
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:26,949
and my desk is connected to the monitor. The monitor is sitting here and the webcam is on

491
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:41,460
the monitor. So when I go like this, I shake the whole thing and I'm like shaking right now here.

492
01:24:41,460 --> 01:25:06,390
I really probably should put this somewhere else, shouldn't I? These ones are so small. I hate it.

493
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:29,260
They're too small. These little meatballs. Oh, I hate it. I just have to do like, they hate them.

494
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:35,500
You got, okay. This for those new viewers out there, I hate needing to like hold left mouse

495
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:41,579
button down and like trace like really small, tiny little areas really consistently. Oh,

496
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:47,369
it just makes me want to scream. It makes me want to scream like, I just want to like just

497
01:25:47,369 --> 01:25:52,310
get up and run in a fucking circle. I just had like my arm. I hate it. Like it feels fucking,

498
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:56,039
I hate it. Oh, funka ass.

499
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:14,119
You only got to spray this once. Like don't spray this too much in the bathroom. You know what I

500
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:18,520
mean? I know people like, I know if you go to the bathroom, you really don't want anyone to know

501
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,279
you went to the bathroom. You're doing that. Don't fucking do this. Just literally like this.

502
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:30,869
This is all you need. Ready? That's it. And then fucking stop and then just leave. Relax.

503
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:49,510
Why can't I? Right on the rotisserie. I love it.

504
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:08,810
I'm serious. I would be a horrible dentist. You're right.

505
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:15,609
You're like, turn it with your mouth open. The dentist is like really leaning in and slowly

506
01:27:15,609 --> 01:27:26,329
cleaning each tooth and then goes like, what's he doing? No, sorry, man. I just like, I just

507
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:32,010
hate like being like doing tiny little movements. My arm gets lost. I feel weird. I would think

508
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:57,079
there was a spider in my mouth. It was the other day. Stop shaking your webcam. Stop shaking your

509
01:27:57,079 --> 01:28:03,859
webcam. Stop shaking your webcam. I'll put it somewhere else later. I'll like glue it to the

510
01:28:03,859 --> 01:28:08,310
fucking wall or something. I don't know. Where are you supposed to put a webcam? To like prevent

511
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:14,789
that from happening. I don't, you know what I mean? What am I supposed to put a webcam to make this

512
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:36,920
not happen? You're the streamer. I mean like you'll use a DSLR with a stand. I'm not using a DSLR.

513
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:53,560
No fucking thanks. Nope. I don't want, I don't want you guys to see every individual pore on my face.

514
01:28:53,640 --> 01:29:08,710
Sorry, not happening. Not, not pushing 40. Not pushing 40. That's not happening. You, we want

515
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:13,109
to see you in 4k. I don't want to see me in 4k. So why would I want you to see me in 4k?

516
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:24,550
What an insecure millionaire.

517
01:29:30,550 --> 01:29:36,789
Huh?

518
01:29:47,909 --> 01:30:01,130
Let's go. This dude's not, what are you saying? We want to see, we want to see your beautiful face.

519
01:30:04,489 --> 01:30:09,130
You're looking at it, literally looking at it right now. Donate your teeth. What, what do you,

520
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:34,500
no shut up. In a nice way, right? Like shut up in a nice way. These bones are so little. All right,

521
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:40,310
so I can have somebody do this and I can do like the digging part, right? Do I have to make money

522
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:50,779
or something? Or do I have to do these few because it's like that tutorial. This is kind of relaxing

523
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:54,279
though. I can see this just kind of hanging out and just doing this. I know exactly what I'm doing

524
01:30:54,279 --> 01:31:13,159
right now. That other one's definitely the head. No way it's not. It is. This is a big one. Okay,

525
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:25,770
so now can I just have somebody do it? Shut up in a respectful way. It's the whole skeleton.

526
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:53,930
Can I live in your pores? That is fucking weird. Find that person out. Oh my God, look at this.

527
01:31:53,930 --> 01:32:10,710
Tons of little things in here. Okay, also preparation room. What happens if I do that?

528
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:25,479
Where is it? Does somebody else do it? Do I have to go get it? Oh, okay. Somebody's just doing it.

529
01:32:25,479 --> 01:32:35,579
Oh, this is way better. Can it be fire? Yeah, I could have had one going while I did the other one.

530
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:48,949
They're way faster than you. I just started working here. What is this prestige road map?

531
01:32:48,949 --> 01:33:01,210
It's almost done. I thought you were being attacked by a serious scam. I can't even say

532
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:15,159
serious Sam enemy. This IRL takes about five years. Oh my God, that's so much better.

533
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:25,369
So with this, I can put, I can display this. Holy shit, that wind. I feel like my fucking,

534
01:33:26,489 --> 01:33:48,279
that's scary. They had like, look at these eye bones. Okay. All right, I have a full dinosaur.

535
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:55,050
What kind of dinosaur is it? The museum I was doing my internship in was getting ready for

536
01:33:55,050 --> 01:34:01,619
renovation. I was afraid my classes were about to be cut because of that. I wouldn't have been

537
01:34:01,619 --> 01:34:07,380
more wrong about this one. Turns out the exhibition hall was being revamped. I was asked to participate

538
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:12,819
in the redecoration, but that's not all of it. We were also given a second complete skeleton

539
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:18,579
of orthothomimus. Orthothomimus. To turn dinosaurs for one display. Well, let's just say all the

540
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:32,020
pictures of dinosaurs. Jesus. This wind is fucking scary, man. All right, put it, let's

541
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:50,760
jack it up. I don't even, can you guys hear it? It's violent. Oh my goodness. What the fuck.

542
01:34:50,760 --> 01:35:02,300
I don't even know you can hear it, but that's fucking insane. Okay, we'll unload. Interior design.

543
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:31,430
Tab. Wait, wait up here. Okay, here we go. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off with this. Holy shit.

544
01:35:32,229 --> 01:35:47,050
Off with this. This wind is scary. I don't know if you guys can hear it. I'm trying to see if you

545
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:54,819
can hear it. All right, setting up skeleton. Whoa, you can make it like a habitat. Wow. Okay.

546
01:35:55,460 --> 01:36:02,810
You can change the skeleton's pose, the grass and stuff. That's cool. Look at the decoration

547
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:24,119
symbols. Decorations and shit. This is fun. Rotate and scaling. What? Okay. Okay. Next pose. I can

548
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:37,829
pose it. Wait, what? This is cool. All right, hold on. I need to, how do I rotate it? Right there.

549
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:53,130
And I want to do a pose. That one's kind of cool. Yep. That's where it's going. Okay. Now. Grass.

550
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:13,640
Jesus Christ. Grab, I like the grass or the sand. That's kind of cool too. Turn off the noise gate.

551
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:20,380
Oh my God, guys. Okay. I'm going to turn the noise gate off. This is what it sounds like without the

552
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:40,229
noise gate. Are you ready? Hold on. Just wait. I mean, you can hear it a little bit, but wait

553
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:53,289
till the huge one happens. I just want to catch a big one. I feel like we're like storm watching

554
01:37:53,289 --> 01:38:00,979
right now. He's going to do a joke, isn't he? No, it's not a joke. It's fucking crazy. Sometimes Vegas

555
01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:16,489
gets 70 plus mile per hour wins. No, I want a big one to happen before I continue.

556
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:25,960
When a big one happens, when every time I go, Jesus, that's what you, that's what I'm reacting

557
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:43,659
to. Now it's not going to do it because I'm like waiting for it to happen. No, he's going to just

558
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:54,579
do a huge fart. I'm like, okay guys, wait for it. And I just go like, that would be really funny.

559
01:38:54,579 --> 01:39:02,739
It would be like, that would piss a lot of you off, but all right, I'm going to give this like

560
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:33,590
20 or 30 more seconds. 10 more seconds. Viewers dropping. It's, I don't care. 10 seconds. Come

561
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:47,319
on, just do it so I can stop doing this. Viewers rising. I don't care. That was a mini one. 10

562
01:39:47,319 --> 01:40:16,810
seconds. Every time I talk, it happens. It doesn't want to do it now. Whatever. Okay. Just know that

563
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:44,279
it's really crazy. You know what I mean? What does that sound like? I just fucking screamed into the

564
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:57,220
mic. Can you hear it? Okay. Let's get back to what we were doing. That's unfortunate. I really want,

565
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:07,770
I want you guys to hear it. Okay. So it's like you're trapped in a box of frosted flakes.

566
01:41:11,319 --> 01:41:24,140
Hello. Is that what it sounded like? I'm going to go with the stones. A huge one just happened

567
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:37,399
and I get right when I turn it off. I only have one plant. Big plants. No, we'll get rid of that.

568
01:41:37,399 --> 01:42:09,020
Freeze. Grass. All right. That's fine. That looks good. Perfect. Looks good to me. Wait a minute.

569
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:20,250
Take out. Oh shit. I need, I need more room. I guess get fit here. Uh, how do I move this back

570
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:36,260
again? That's okay. Um, this, I need to, can I, what should I sell this? Like the stupid fucking

571
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:42,359
Zamboni machines in the way. How do I get rid of that? Back, back up. I have to get, move this

572
01:42:42,359 --> 01:43:08,010
thing. Ooh, this is pretty fucking cool. I like that. That's, that's pretty museum like. I like

573
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:15,739
this one. All right. Walls. Ooh, I like that. I like this one. I like this one. No, I don't.

574
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:23,050
This one's good. All right. Decorations. We need a bench here so people can sit and look at them,

575
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:37,210
fighting each other. I want to plant over here. No, a little bigger than that. Paintings. Stacker

576
01:43:37,210 --> 01:44:02,020
them. Stacker them. Cool. I found that. That doesn't look bad. All right. Now I need to,

577
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:20,899
I got to, can I move this over? I got to move this here. It's kind of in the way though,

578
01:44:20,899 --> 01:44:37,800
isn't it? Wait, what's that mean? Oh, I, I, this thing's, how do I make it so I can fit it?

579
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:47,960
Paintings suck. Make it one big exhibit. Yeah. How do I do that? Can I put them both in here?

580
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:59,180
I could make it just one huge exhibit, right? And then put the other one in. I can. All right.

581
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:12,819
Nice. Nice. Nice. This is perfect. Okay. So I want to put this one here, rotate it. It's too big.

582
01:45:12,819 --> 01:45:27,399
That's not bad. If it right there. All right. I want to pose him though. That's all right.

583
01:45:27,399 --> 01:45:37,340
That looks fine. We need some more plants and shit though. Move this over here. This looks pretty

584
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:50,579
good. That looks fine. Okay. Now we need, um, there's a little like bird nest for this. All

585
01:45:50,579 --> 01:46:04,489
right. That's good. We got it. Look. Beautiful. Stunning. Close these fucking windows. I don't

586
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:13,979
want people looking in here for free. Cut these up. Ooh. Oh. Ooh. Ooh. What's that dinosaur claw?

587
01:46:13,979 --> 01:46:23,460
Whoa. I'm in a weird mood tonight and I'm really sorry. That was the last day of a

588
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:36,520
too symmetrical adventure. Just believe it's a weird phone. The director called to ask me to stay

589
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:42,260
and help the museum build a bigger skeleton. There was a vacant position because one of the

590
01:46:42,260 --> 01:46:50,250
workers got sick. I felt bad for the guy, but I was so glad there was a chance to work in the museum

591
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:58,500
for longer. The decision was a no brainer. I went to the museum the next day. Although the place

592
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:04,020
wasn't new to me, this particular moment felt different. It was the first time I was asked to

593
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:09,859
enter the museum's workshop with my heart pounding and my hands sweating. I walked towards the door.

594
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:29,220
Okay. Just in case I got to shake somebody's hand. Oh wow. This is a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

595
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:36,140
I've got to admit, bigger skeleton the director was talking about was indeed a huge one. I was

596
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:42,539
dumbstruck when I was faced with the legendary Tyrannosaurus. Even in my dreams, I would never

597
01:47:42,539 --> 01:48:05,670
fathom that our museum was in possession of such a treasure. Complete the T-Rex. You got it. Oh.

598
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:34,420
Oh. Collectively, everybody in the room. Oh. Oh. This is tongue. Never mind. Shut up, please.

599
01:48:36,100 --> 01:49:05,270
Okay. I'll shut up. How am I supposed to get those up here? I have to walk. I can throw. I can't. I

600
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:14,520
have to walk individually. No, I don't. So I could have decorated this place too. When do we stop

601
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:43,189
making money? What I want to know. I want to go dig some more. That was really fun. Oh, I did it.

602
01:49:43,189 --> 01:50:01,699
The hidden skeleton of Tyrannosaurus looked majestic and I had the honor to contribute to it.

603
01:50:01,699 --> 01:50:05,779
Yet another beautiful moment that has been etched in my memory. Open your window? No.

604
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:16,329
It sounds like Interstellar. It does. It does. If I saw the movie, which I haven't. I don't know.

605
01:50:16,329 --> 01:50:20,090
It's pretty amped up. I've never seen that movie. Just pretended to know what you meant.

606
01:50:20,090 --> 01:50:26,409
Finding a job, but that was about to change soon. For the first six months after graduation,

607
01:50:26,409 --> 01:50:31,289
my focus was to find a job in the field of paleontology, or at least something that

608
01:50:31,289 --> 01:50:36,170
relates to it. I submitted my resume for every paleontologist job I could find. But didn't I

609
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:41,529
get a job already? Jobs were either already taken or I lacked the experience. After six months,

610
01:50:41,529 --> 01:50:47,609
I started looking for any job, but that also didn't come easily. I was trying hard, but to

611
01:50:47,609 --> 01:50:52,810
no avail. Not a good movie, but everyone saw it. I didn't see it. One year after graduation,

612
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:57,529
things finally started to turn around. Although it wasn't exactly how I had imagined it.

613
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:08,420
Did I give my Spider-Man take yet? Did I give my new Spider-Man movie take yet?

614
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:16,390
Okay. I didn't. Okay. Let me give you my Spider-Man. Just real quick. The second half

615
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:22,539
of the Spider-Man No Way Home movie felt like a college humor video.

616
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:31,689
Is it? That's the take I'm going to have. That's the only take I'm going to give you.

617
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:50,069
It felt like an old college humor video from like 2011, 2008. Did I think it was a bad movie?

618
01:51:50,069 --> 01:52:01,640
No. It was very enjoyable. It was very enjoyable. I almost kind of felt like

619
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:08,949
the second, like third of the movie. I was expecting actors to look into the camera and smile

620
01:52:09,829 --> 01:52:16,260
after saying anything. Like, oh yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what I was expecting.

621
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:27,699
After every three or four lines. I thought it was good. I liked it. I liked it, but I felt like I

622
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:34,010
was just watching a movie. You know what I mean? It was like a movie. It was like, hey, we're making

623
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:39,050
a movie right now. Do you know there's a movie on the screen? It was like, hey, I just want to let

624
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:45,500
you know that you're watching a movie right now. Hey, this is a movie. You like movies, don't you?

625
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,779
You've seen movies, haven't you? You're a big fan of movies. I like movies too.

626
01:52:52,939 --> 01:53:04,199
Am I, is this my house? Hey, let me, I'm going to be very honest with you. Spider-Man is my

627
01:53:04,199 --> 01:53:09,960
favorite character in everything. It's not Batman. It's not Captain America. It's Spider-Man. Spider-Man

628
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:15,560
is my favorite character. And I think the trilogy was the best Spider-Man trilogy, the best Spider-Man

629
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:22,180
movies that they've ever made. Oh, but what about Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie? All right, get out,

630
01:53:22,180 --> 01:53:29,399
let go of me. Yeah, they're great. But I think they, I think this trilogy was great. I think they were

631
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:37,029
great. Like Homecoming, it's fucking amazing. Far From Home, I loved it. This one, I liked it.

632
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:51,340
I really liked it. I liked it. I liked it a lot. That's it. Venom, be careful. How do I go in my

633
01:53:51,340 --> 01:54:01,659
house? Where are my keys? But a part of me almost felt like in some of the scenes in the new Spider-Man

634
01:54:01,659 --> 01:54:07,340
movie, like the director was just going to start walking around on the set with like a fucking stone

635
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:11,500
in his hand, with like the thing in his hand, like just be like, this looks good. Okay. Just like

636
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:21,819
walking around in the background. All right, how do I, select drone? No, I want to go, how do I go

637
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:36,260
into my house? What was the objective? 35 year old man complains about comic book movies. I'm not

638
01:54:36,260 --> 01:54:43,960
complaining. That's not a complaint. That was a very, very mild observation. It was mild. It was

639
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:52,279
very, very mild. Okay. How do I go in my house? Holy shit. I get every channel on every from every

640
01:54:52,279 --> 01:54:59,060
country that literally every country on earth. I get all their TV stations. I'd love to get in here.

641
01:54:59,619 --> 01:55:06,869
That was a mild take. Okay. Come on. Oh my God. What is this? Why is there a car made out of

642
01:55:06,869 --> 01:55:16,899
ground beef in my house? How do I get in here? What's going on? How do I get in the house?

643
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:21,750
I have to go in the garage? Why can't I go in my front door?

644
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:36,279
Oh, watch out for the red barrels. Dude, I'm sorry. I'm not going in there if there's red

645
01:55:36,279 --> 01:55:41,220
barrels. Like bright red barrels is like, those explode. I'm not going in there.

646
01:55:54,729 --> 01:55:59,369
His body didn't catch up with his spirit and he had to pass on his little project.

647
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:07,060
I decided to clean up the workshop for him. Yeah, dude. I don't know. You've like bright

648
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:12,819
red barrels with like the flame sign on them. We are slowly getting these out of the house.

649
01:56:12,819 --> 01:56:27,109
We're removing these. Okay. What am I doing? Can I just like, no, I can't. What does this happen?

650
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:36,069
What the fuck, dude? What is going on in here? Yeah. My grandfather collected exploding barrels

651
01:56:36,069 --> 01:56:40,970
and he kept them all in his garage for some fucking reason. I don't know why. I don't know why.

652
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:55,300
Do I have to fix the car? What the fuck was in there? Wash your hands. Wash your hands.

653
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:59,859
Grandpa was shitting into a box. Wash your hands immediately. Go wash your hands right now.

654
01:56:59,859 --> 01:57:09,699
I lost fossil piece that I found during the school trip. Despite it being over 15 years ago,

655
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:14,899
I felt the exact same mix of excitement and joy that I'd felt on that beach years ago.

656
01:57:14,899 --> 01:57:26,460
The desire to search for fossils has become immediately obvious with full force. All my

657
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:31,739
problems. This game is cool. I actually think this is fun and game. I just had to put it

658
01:57:31,739 --> 01:57:37,000
into action. I started implementing my plan by acquiring a set of excavation tools.

659
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:43,619
This was possible thanks to a garage sale. Wait, now we're not going to glaze over the fact that

660
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:50,550
grandpa has a bunch of like fucking gas tanks in his garage? I thought those were like guns.

661
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:59,500
Like oh my like rifle collection. Okay. Look at your desk from time to time. You may find a pale

662
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:03,420
intelligent dude. There's a lot of content in this game. I'm not going to let the negative Andes

663
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:07,819
here tell me. There's a lot of interesting content. This is cool. I think this is actually pretty

664
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:22,840
cool. I do. Okay. Like you can paint. Wait, I can mess with the car? In the next room in the garage,

665
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:28,170
the museum, you can see a map on the wall. It will show available locations that you can travel to.

666
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:37,850
Can I go to Nevada? If Nevada is in this game and I can go to like Las Vegas, this is a B plus. This

667
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:47,609
game is a B. You can also find here collectible items discovered during research expeditions.

668
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:59,350
This is like my house. This is cool. Okay. So what's on the news?

669
01:58:59,989 --> 01:59:17,239
Dinosaur skeletons are waiting to be discovered. There's a toy. Hard difficulty.

670
01:59:18,039 --> 02:01:24,500
Don't get me. I don't want to do that. All right. Let's um, let's go. Okay. Those elbows are a little

671
02:01:24,500 --> 02:02:07,909
fucked up. He's supposed to be going like this, like with his arms, like on his side. He's like a

672
02:02:07,909 --> 02:02:48,869
muscle shirt button up on. All right. Now I need one more finishing touch. Those teeth are kind of

673
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:56,760
fucked up. Um, this is just like somebody drawing like their boss. You know what I mean? Like, oh,

674
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:14,939
there he is. That motherfucker. Like, oh, this is the boss. You're gonna get fired. This is too much

675
02:03:14,939 --> 02:03:25,739
empty space up here. There's too much empty space up here. I'm not happy with this piece.

676
02:03:25,739 --> 02:03:31,989
I ain't happy with this. Get back to work. Yeah. I crumpled it up before the boss gets over.

677
02:03:31,989 --> 02:03:40,170
I'm like, what you working on over there? That's just, uh, just like, you know, stats and shit.

678
02:03:40,899 --> 02:03:47,720
I was drawing the boss. There's too much empty space here. I'm not happy with this. I'm going

679
02:03:47,720 --> 02:04:08,500
to throw it all away. Put sunglasses on them. No, no, I'm not happy with this. How about like a house

680
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:17,340
in the background, right? We got to have like some, some, uh, focal point, right? Yeah. He's

681
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:24,539
in the foreground. Don't adjust your fucking TV, man. Don't adjust your screen. This is perspective

682
02:04:24,539 --> 02:05:33,960
here. He's in the foreground. Don't be alarmed. This guy's scary. The house shouldn't be like alive.

683
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:43,800
He's focusing. I feel like this is okay. Don't they do those things where it's like the way you

684
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:50,539
draw a house, the way you draw a person, the way you draw a son. Isn't this like, you can determine

685
02:05:50,539 --> 02:05:54,300
the kind of like personality, like psychology that I have or something, right? I feel like I just did

686
02:05:54,300 --> 02:06:05,770
all of those. So there you go. All right. Now what do I, how do I, what do I do with this?

687
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:14,149
It's just going to be there. Can I hang this up? I definitely did not draw these. I did not,

688
02:06:14,149 --> 02:06:29,000
the same person did not draw those at all. What the fuck? Dinosaurs on Mars. Okay. So now what do

689
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:39,460
I do? I get, I'm trapped in here. Get me out of here. All right. I'm fine. Holy shit. What did you

690
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:54,659
get a military vehicle? Why do I have a military truck? I'm sorry, guys. They both have to be

691
02:06:54,659 --> 02:07:31,909
Jurassic park theme trucks. Okay. Oh, you've, you've really leaning into that here. That's good. Okay.

692
02:07:31,909 --> 02:07:59,180
I'm ready. Make it bright pink. It's like a big bubble gum car. All right. That's good. Oh,

693
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:09,720
Jerma. Oh, I know. Hey, Jerma. All right. Now what do I do? That was my blue though. I need blue.

694
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:17,460
I need to, okay. I need a third car. And that third car has to be like an aqua, like a teal.

695
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:27,159
Nice Thanos truck. It's not the Thanos truck. It's literally bubble gum pink. What kind of

696
02:08:27,159 --> 02:08:32,119
insane person puts their lawnmower on a shelf like this? Am I weird for not ever doing that?

697
02:08:32,119 --> 02:08:55,899
What do I do with this stuff? These are all locked. It's all locked. Am I insane for not

698
02:08:55,899 --> 02:09:01,930
doing? How do you just get it down? Like how do you pull it down? There's a lot of tools.

699
02:09:01,930 --> 02:09:10,520
Okay. Where's my, what do I have to do? Messages. Travel. I think I just go, right? I just go

700
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:24,819
somewhere else. Knowledge. Management. Whoa. Oh, I have no points. Workers. How do I get out of here?

701
02:09:24,819 --> 02:09:45,529
What do I do? How do I like get out of here? Travel. I have no destinations. I got no destinations.

702
02:09:45,529 --> 02:10:03,340
I have to read the newspaper. Play Fortnite instead. I would never mind. How do I get out of here?

703
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:14,710
You should dig here. Oh, there we go. Okay. All right. We're going up to Canada. Canada.

704
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:27,800
We're going to be taking the grandpa truck into Canada. I need some more of this. I need some

705
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:34,680
more of my drink. Can we take a quick break? Right. So can I can go fill up my drink again?

706
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:43,289
I'm gonna fill my drink up. I'll be right back. I want more of a drink. It's green tea. Relax.

707
02:10:43,289 --> 02:10:53,289
I'll be right back. Well, it's green tea with vitamins. With vitamins. All right,

708
02:10:53,289 --> 02:15:22,699
baby. Boys and girls, I have a treat for you. I have a treat for you. I completely forgot about

709
02:15:22,699 --> 02:15:35,350
this until I just was reminded. So the Vata Science Center, if you guys remember, this past year,

710
02:15:37,380 --> 02:15:45,510
we did that kind of all the raising the money and stuff. And the community was able to give

711
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:58,090
them $10,000, if you remember. Pretty cool shit. They sent, they sent some really cool shit.

712
02:15:58,729 --> 02:16:01,770
I don't even know what half of it is, but let's, you want to examine it? It's like,

713
02:16:01,770 --> 02:16:10,680
they sent literally fossils. Actual fossils here. You really want to take a look? Let's take a look.

714
02:16:11,399 --> 02:16:19,750
I don't know what a lot of this stuff is, but we'll find out, right? The game can wait for

715
02:16:19,750 --> 02:16:40,760
just a sec. Oh my God. I look crazed. Okay. So let's take a look at some of this stuff.

716
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:49,719
They're in these little bags. I think this is, I don't know what this is, but it's some type of

717
02:16:49,719 --> 02:16:57,940
fossilized like pyrite. There's a bunch of these. There's like at least four or five of these. It's

718
02:16:57,940 --> 02:17:07,420
in this cute little bag. I think this is for fools gold. Yeah. Hey, that's cool. You see? Very cool.

719
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:15,270
But that's not necessarily a fossil, right? This is. Be careful. I don't like break this. I think

720
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:22,500
this is like a tooth. I think they explained what they were. I just don't remember. Take a look at

721
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:29,780
this thing. This is crazy looking. Yeah. Look at this. This is like, this is, look at this thing.

722
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:41,020
This is like a tooth. What is this? Isn't that crazy looking? This is like a dinosaur tooth or

723
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:49,299
like a shark tooth. It's moving on the other side, right? But over here, it's really tiny fossilized

724
02:17:49,299 --> 02:17:59,770
like shark tooth or fossilized dinosaur tooth. That one's really cool. Is it a plant? It looks

725
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:09,819
like a tooth. That's a crustacean, you idiot. No, this is a crustacean, you idiot. Oh my God. This

726
02:18:09,819 --> 02:18:18,780
is kind of delicate. This is like a, whoa. I don't even remember seeing this one. This is a

727
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:29,239
fossilized cinnamon bun roll. Fossilized cinnamon bun roll. That's like a shell. It's like a seashell.

728
02:18:29,239 --> 02:18:45,610
Look at that. Let me get a better view here. It's pretty detailed. You can't really see maybe,

729
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:56,969
but it's really detailed. It's like a nautilus or something, right? There's another one here too.

730
02:18:56,969 --> 02:19:10,940
What's this one? Whoa. This one feels weird. What the fuck is this? Whoa. This one's crazy.

731
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:16,780
Oh my God. It's like a, it's a fucking skeleton. This is actually a skeleton. Are you ready for

732
02:19:16,780 --> 02:19:37,379
the reveal? Check this out. It's like a rib cage or something. Look at that. It's like a,

733
02:19:37,379 --> 02:19:49,209
of like an animal's rib cage. It's like embedded in there. It's crazy looking. It's like a big

734
02:19:49,209 --> 02:20:00,649
fossilized bug or something, whatever it is. What's it called? It's trilobite. It's an ancient pill

735
02:20:00,649 --> 02:20:12,920
bug. All of a sudden, like six legs break out from the sides and like, like crawls in my mouth.

736
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:21,350
What is, what is that? Extinct marine anthropods that form one of the earliest known groups of

737
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:29,510
anthropods. The first appearance. So this is a legit fucking real animal here. Whoa. Whoa. It's

738
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:41,059
weird. It's like, you can see its tail. I didn't show you this part. See, see like that ridge in

739
02:20:41,059 --> 02:20:49,670
the middle there. That's like its tail. Whoa. This is weird. Whoa. Cool. All right. It's going

740
02:20:49,670 --> 02:21:03,959
back in the bag. That's what they looked like? Dude, it moved. I want to look at this one again.

741
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:10,299
You guys saying this is not a tooth. This is like a leaf. I know for a fact that they described them

742
02:21:10,299 --> 02:21:15,030
when they sent them. I just kind of forget. It's been a while. Yeah. Look at the pattern on that.

743
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:34,889
That's insane looking. Look at it. It's like a, is it a leaf? It's wild looking. Some kind of shell.

744
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:40,329
Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Well, what a perfect time to do that. I'm probably going to wash my hands.

745
02:21:40,329 --> 02:21:47,030
I think. I don't know. I feel like if you touch like a 5 million year old animal, I feel like

746
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:51,780
I don't want to like put my hands on my face. Is that weird? Like, I feel like I should wash my hands.

747
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:56,020
Shouldn't I? All right. I'll be right back. I'm going to wash my hands. Give me one second.

748
02:22:40,409 --> 02:22:49,270
Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I don't want to have like some 10 million year old bacteria

749
02:22:49,270 --> 02:23:03,799
get into my body or something. All right. Let's go. It's a rock. It doesn't matter.

750
02:23:03,799 --> 02:23:08,139
Remember it's a rock. I don't know. It could be something. It could be embedded. Some kind

751
02:23:08,139 --> 02:23:14,229
of bacteria or something. Who eats rocks? I'm not going to put like my hands on a rock and

752
02:23:14,229 --> 02:23:30,579
put my hands in my mouth. I put my hands in my face all the time. You did. You eat rocks.

753
02:23:30,579 --> 02:23:38,260
That was, that was for research purposes, not for to eat for pleasure, right? That wasn't for me.

754
02:23:38,260 --> 02:23:43,059
I wasn't hungry. That was for research purposes to determine where, how old that rock could have

755
02:23:43,059 --> 02:23:58,790
been. That was for research purposes. That was for me to determine how old the rock was. I think he's

756
02:23:58,790 --> 02:24:13,750
on meth. That was cool. They look like face huggers. Yeah they do.

757
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:40,600
Look up isopods. They're like dinosaur bugs. Yeah that's, they're scary. They're scary. Okay.

758
02:24:41,799 --> 02:24:53,370
Back to the game. Oh I'm in like, this is a bigger open world now. All right. So we're going to go

759
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:58,889
through the same thing. What's the map look like? Where's the dig site? There is none. I just have

760
02:24:58,889 --> 02:25:15,590
to go find it. Let's go. Mouse sensitivity has got to go down, like way down. There we go. Do I have

761
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:23,930
enough boxes? I need boxes. I need my excavation equipment to be loaded. Changing cars and fast

762
02:25:23,930 --> 02:25:30,260
travel. Yeah you can change cars and travel around. Off-road. An important part of the hub

763
02:25:30,260 --> 02:25:35,559
is the laptop workstation. Change the car if you feel like it. Okay. Fuel tanks are used to refill

764
02:25:35,559 --> 02:25:41,100
gas canisters. I feel like that's not going to be too important but it might be later. On the hub

765
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:44,780
you'll find the equipment necessary to set up your excavation as well as empty boxes for transporting

766
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:49,750
fossils. Put the crates with the fossils that you want to transport to the museum in the highlighted

767
02:25:49,750 --> 02:26:01,159
area. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Let's go. Press E. Okay I want a few of these right?

768
02:26:01,719 --> 02:26:10,459
Car managing station. Car switching and fast travel. Once you have hired the right employees

769
02:26:10,459 --> 02:26:15,500
to be able to use the fast travel tab. Yeah you need to hire employees to fast travel. That's

770
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:26,579
good to know. And I can just switch cars with the laptop. Okay. Hack digging tools. Car trunk

771
02:26:26,579 --> 02:26:47,719
is full. With what? What's in the trunk? What do you mean it's full? Pick up canister. Canister

772
02:26:47,719 --> 02:27:01,770
into the car. Okay. All right so we're good right? These simple crates can be packed only into the

773
02:27:01,770 --> 02:27:07,979
back of the trunk which is occupied at the moment. So why? Can I not bring these? Are they? I think

774
02:27:07,979 --> 02:27:21,989
there's already a couple already in there. I don't know. I need to make two trips. What about over

775
02:27:21,989 --> 02:27:41,290
here? Can I like go over there? Is it my free to explore now? What should I set up? What about

776
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:49,159
like right here? Being in the mine. Dumbledore's voice? Notice the excavation area in its lowest

777
02:27:49,159 --> 02:27:54,120
part. This is where I was to start my search. When have I ever done a Dumbledore impression? Strong

778
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:59,239
wind to destroy the excavation equipment. So my first job was to clean up the exploration area

779
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:06,389
and set up a new fence. I've never done a Dumbledore impression. Well okay I'll try. Oh Harry

780
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:14,040
as you know the three houses must come together in harmony Harry. Like that? Is that good?

781
02:28:19,659 --> 02:28:39,610
So much shit everywhere. Hold on. That was Voldemort. That was Harry Potter Dumbledore.

782
02:29:01,959 --> 02:29:10,059
Oh yes his full name. Harry Potter Dumbledore. No I said name of the series colon name of the

783
02:29:10,059 --> 02:29:30,139
character. Hey there's so much. Okay I do have to clear the whole road of this bullshit.

784
02:29:30,940 --> 02:29:44,500
I'm not doing it. I'm just clearing this part to drive over it. Do your classic Cookie Monster

785
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:50,549
voice. Cookie Monsters like Tasmanian Devil. You have to go all in or it's not going to work.

786
02:29:53,959 --> 02:29:58,120
You can't do a Cookie Monster impression by just going like oh it's me. No no no you have to go

787
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:14,329
all in please. All right four-wheel drive come on. I don't want to clear this whole thing. I just

788
02:30:14,329 --> 02:30:27,860
want to go. Maybe it'll unstuck me on the other side. You just put me on top of these. Wait no

789
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:45,819
it worked. Oh my god come on unstuck it again. I'm already over the thing. I'm already there.

790
02:30:45,819 --> 02:30:51,420
There we go. All right we're good. So where do I want to set up shop here?

791
02:30:56,649 --> 02:31:00,389
Do a Cookie Monster impression now. I forget what Cookie Monster sounds like.

792
02:31:03,209 --> 02:31:12,549
It's like it's like you need like almost like a voice changer with it. Hold on.

793
02:31:12,549 --> 02:31:19,350
What does Cookie Monster sound like? It's like um what does it sound like? It's kind of like

794
02:31:25,930 --> 02:31:32,459
cookies. I love cookies right? Something like that. I don't know it's something like that.

795
02:31:37,610 --> 02:31:41,299
The problem is that I didn't I didn't go all in. Let me try to let me go all in with it and see

796
02:31:41,299 --> 02:31:52,520
what happens. This cookie is delicious. I love cookies. Oh yes cookies. That's not that's not

797
02:31:52,520 --> 02:32:00,729
really not that good but I mean it's how do you even do it? It's so gravely that it kind of hurts.

798
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:11,850
That's just an orc. Done building ship. Done building ship.

799
02:32:12,489 --> 02:32:19,670
We need more gold. I'm done doing that. I'm not doing it ever fucking again for the rest

800
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:35,350
of my life. None of you are going to hear that ever again. I promise. You notice it's the ow.

801
02:32:36,420 --> 02:32:44,520
It's the dob dob dob part. I fucking hate that. Don't you? Like the dob dob dob nom nom right?

802
02:32:44,520 --> 02:33:03,500
It's like shut up. I hate it. That's the worst impression. No it's not. It's not even close.

803
02:33:06,420 --> 02:33:20,520
All right I gotta secure the area. Secure it. Left mouse button. I need to secure this area.

804
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:36,170
Let's go. Secure it. Secure it. Secure it. I can't. I'm clicking. Secure it. Secure the area. Oh there

805
02:33:36,170 --> 02:33:41,909
we go. All right we can skip this. I'm excited now. Now we get to actually do the the fun part.

806
02:33:44,069 --> 02:33:59,940
Why would I drop down to the sky? Okay use your laptop to transport crates by drones.

807
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:06,360
Oh I can call it? Really? Well let's just let's do this. Let's get started here. Other tool

808
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:21,370
information. What about the other tools? Underwater fossil searching. Okay turn it on. Suck out all the

809
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:31,899
water. All right diving. Dry the area. Suck out all the water. Shallow water that blocks digging

810
02:34:31,899 --> 02:34:35,500
must be pumped out with a diesel water pump. Place it in the highlighted spot. Turn it on and wait

811
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:40,889
until the water is completely pumped out. And then connect the lamp in case it gets dark out.

812
02:34:40,889 --> 02:34:48,780
And then you got a generator just in case it gets some new electricity. All right other tools. All

813
02:34:48,780 --> 02:35:06,899
right let's go. Uh let's pump it up. Wait I need my uh device right? These have fossils in them?

814
02:35:10,649 --> 02:35:25,350
I'm fucking drowning. Okay okay you can die. All right I need my um this is a death mechanic. You

815
02:35:25,350 --> 02:35:47,370
almost became a fossil. I need um my thing. Uh where's the the little ghost buster tool? Did

816
02:35:47,370 --> 02:36:02,649
I bring my ghost buster tool? There it is. I'm just gonna go clean them up and throw them over

817
02:36:02,649 --> 02:36:24,680
here. Just remember that's where those are. All right let's do an inspection here. Anything? Nope

818
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:33,370
what about the one I threw over here? Nope nope okay. I have to take them out and throw them.

819
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:40,870
There's a giant gold nugget. What would that be worth? A gold nugget this big would be worth

820
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:56,739
how much? Like a few million? Isn't this some asteroid or something that's worth like 50

821
02:36:56,739 --> 02:37:09,559
trillion dollars in gold or something? Yes there is. There is right? Am I just making that up?

822
02:37:09,559 --> 02:37:26,659
All right I gotta check on these ones. My uncle has that asteroid. Are you serious?

823
02:37:27,219 --> 02:37:54,549
You're not even you're not subscribed. What he's these guys this this guy's got a net worth of

824
02:37:54,549 --> 02:38:13,079
like 50 trillion dollars. All right let me check these. But what if he doesn't like your stream?

825
02:38:13,079 --> 02:38:24,520
What if he does though? There's nothing in any of these shitty rocks. Something's moving in this

826
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:43,020
one. This one's gonna hatch. Okay I don't want to get confused because I'll- my uncle learned how

827
02:38:43,020 --> 02:38:56,819
to do a kick flip last week. You're not subscribed either but you didn't celebrate your uncle's kick

828
02:38:56,819 --> 02:39:07,540
flip and subscribe here? Really? I don't think there's anything even down here. I'm just doing

829
02:39:07,540 --> 02:39:21,450
this for no reason. So uncool. Yeah I mean that's like not cool. I don't want to have to keep

830
02:39:21,450 --> 02:39:32,780
coming down here throwing rocks. Can I just suck up all the water? One of these has to have something

831
02:39:32,780 --> 02:40:07,459
right? Yeah! What is it? I can't identify it. Oh he's he's he's having a monologue here.

832
02:40:15,559 --> 02:40:19,770
What's huge? What is it? What did you find?

833
02:40:25,719 --> 02:40:35,719
All right is it gold? No it's something something actually pretty important I think. I think it's

834
02:40:35,719 --> 02:40:42,149
important. General Macerous Albertensis.

835
02:40:48,229 --> 02:40:55,590
Oh shit my power might go up. Did you see that? Uh oh.

836
02:41:01,459 --> 02:41:10,729
Uh did it blink? Did you guys see the power like that the lights just like uh okay well

837
02:41:10,729 --> 02:41:25,379
oh power doesn't go up. There's probably more in here. It's probably the whole dinosaur for

838
02:41:25,379 --> 02:41:31,780
god's sake. I'm gonna have to do this. Okay just bear with me. It's gonna be the whole

839
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:34,899
dinosaur down here. Yeah of course it is. All right the whole dinosaur is down here.

840
02:41:48,329 --> 02:42:05,370
That's such an excuse to end the stream early. Bro my power just flickered. What?

841
02:42:07,299 --> 02:42:14,069
Like you could just see the lights flick. I I said oh man uh power's gonna go off probably

842
02:42:14,069 --> 02:42:17,750
guys sorry stream's probably uh what are you talking about? You just you just watched it.

843
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:48,100
Save the game? I got an autosave. Junk. Wait what happened to the one I just was looking at?

844
02:42:48,100 --> 02:42:55,590
Where is it? Okay that's the tail. Yeah this is the same one. Tail set two. Back right limb.

845
02:42:55,590 --> 02:43:00,379
All right send this back to the um I gotta send these back all right send these back.

846
02:43:00,379 --> 02:43:10,420
20 fingers am I holding up? Zero. You're typing in a chat room. All right small crate. Delivery

847
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:24,520
of crates called drone. Do I not have it? I can't do it? Did I not upgrade it? Nothing here right?

848
02:43:25,319 --> 02:43:33,959
There's definitely at least one or two. The head has to be in here. The whole thing's in here.

849
02:43:33,959 --> 02:43:40,500
Bro just carry them. I don't want to carry them. What are you talking about? That's so far.

850
02:43:41,139 --> 02:43:50,860
Can I throw these out? No. I'll do three at a time. That's probably easiest.

851
02:43:51,420 --> 02:44:16,379
Bingo. Oh two here. Okay let's break it up. This game I like this game. I'm skipping class

852
02:44:16,379 --> 02:44:23,110
for the stream. You need to be funny. No you need to go to class and turn off your phone or your

853
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:28,219
laptop whatever it is and not be watching the stream. What are you doing?

854
02:44:31,180 --> 02:44:32,780
You need to be focusing on class right now.

855
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:49,819
Okay so this is plastered up. Can these fit in with more than one thing? You're learning

856
02:44:49,819 --> 02:45:05,450
archaeology right now. Do your fucking homework. Do your homework. All right that's a left limb. I

857
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:13,540
don't have enough space. I need more crates. Um all right well I have to I gotta what do I do

858
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:36,120
with this? I can't hold on. You're such a teacher. I need to have a drone come pick it up. Wait can

859
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:49,020
I just do it? How come you're so catty tonight? I don't know. What do you what does that mean?

860
02:45:49,020 --> 02:46:01,379
Why am I so catty? Am I catty tonight? Name the field of research. This is paleontology.

861
02:46:12,739 --> 02:46:16,819
Okay well I can at least store the other ones. Have to come back and upgrade or something.

862
02:46:16,819 --> 02:46:26,729
Can I put this on the roof? Dude I can't even store this on the roof. Are you shitting me?

863
02:46:26,729 --> 02:46:46,520
I need to put it in the storage area for the drone. I can't. Shit. Oh well I think I can at least

864
02:46:46,520 --> 02:47:01,860
store this one. Um okay so where do I get another pallet right here? Small crate three to six.

865
02:47:01,860 --> 02:47:07,750
Large crates. I can't. I don't think I can pick these up. I think I actually have to drive that back.

866
02:47:08,469 --> 02:47:25,909
All the drone. Yeah I can't. I don't think I have it like unlocked. I don't think I have it unlocked.

867
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:33,940
My uncle is skipping work to watch the stream. These aren't. You're in a

868
02:47:33,940 --> 02:47:41,770
set stop. The laptop. Yeah look look look look. I just. What? Laptop. Management station. E.

869
02:47:41,770 --> 02:47:49,610
I can't do anything. Pallet two. Small crate full. I can't. I think I have to upgrade this.

870
02:47:49,610 --> 02:48:01,299
I think I have to buy it or something. E. E. Cancel. Yeah I need to upgrade it. I'm using

871
02:48:01,299 --> 02:48:17,989
this stream to de-stress. Nice. Hope you hope it works. Hope it's good. All right I don't know.

872
02:48:17,989 --> 02:48:23,290
I don't know. I don't get it. I think it's because I have small crates and not large crates here.

873
02:48:23,290 --> 02:48:31,940
This game was fun. This is a cool game. I like this game. This was cool. But now I'm gonna play

874
02:48:31,940 --> 02:48:46,860
House of the Dead. This was fun. Oh my god. Jesus. Okay we're good. This was fun. I had a good time.

875
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:52,920
Played it for like three hours. That was fun. It was cool to hang out. Let's play House of the Dead.

876
02:48:52,920 --> 02:49:02,379
I've been looking. I wanted to play that. It was a good time to play it. Jesus Christ. Is everything

877
02:49:02,379 --> 02:49:08,819
gonna be all right? The stream might just get turned off. All right give me one sec.
