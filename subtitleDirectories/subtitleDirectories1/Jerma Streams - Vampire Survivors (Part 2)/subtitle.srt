1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:10,699
Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna play. Okay, I have to admit something to you. I played Vampire Survivors off stream. I know, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:19,500
Uh, we're gonna play a little bit though. I unlocked some stuff. I know, people are gonna be mad. Like, played without us. Played without us, yeah.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:34,759
Alright, give me one second, I'm just gonna switch. That was creepy. That was creepy.

4
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:40,549
Maybe I'll do like one or two rounds, just to kind of, uh, pallet cleanse that weird experience, right?

5
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:56,310
Did you like it? I mean, you can't, how, how do you like that experience, right? It's kind of awful.

6
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,909
But it did, like, it did what it was trying to do, and like kind of freak you out and make you feel awful.

7
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:11,670
You know what I mean? It's like, ah dude, didn't you love that? No, like, I hated that. It sucked.

8
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:23,079
But that's like exactly what they were going for, right? So, I mean, yeah, it got, it did what it was doing, what it was trying to do. So yeah.

9
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:41,609
Alright, uh, Vampire Survivors coming up. Cool. Yeah, we need a little bit of a detox here, yeah.

10
00:01:41,609 --> 00:02:04,810
Ooh, that's loud. What's the title right now? Haunted Coffee Shop. Winding down with some vampire survivors.

11
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:13,610
That's pretty accurate. So yeah, I unlocked a few more weapons. Uh, Holly and I were playing it.

12
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:23,400
Because I kind of couldn't get enough, so, you know. Your titles went from amazing to dog shit.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:42,740
Yeah, but dog, I mean, I've, whatever. So, the last thing that I did, I can turn it up a little bit, that's too low.

14
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,439
Oh, I want to go over this too, because this is something that is very new.

15
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,919
So, I'm going to talk to Ludwig, but we might need to move a few things around.

16
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:04,060
Because we planned on Friday for being that kind of PvP night, but I think we need a little bit more time. We'll see.

17
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,050
Um, on Friday, I'm going to do something that I've never done before.

18
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:13,990
This is something that's brand new to the channel, and some of you in pre-stream already know what I'm talking about.

19
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:20,729
I'm doing my first ever sponsored game stream. That's for real, not a joke.

20
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:29,849
Uh, there's been, I remember a few months ago when I signed with Evolved, and they were going to start doing sponsorships.

21
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:36,360
And some of the bigger streams will have more sponsors, and I'll be able to try to make some extra money to be able to do some more of these things.

22
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:45,979
Uh, there's been quite a few things that I could have done already, and I said no, but I'm very selective.

23
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:53,939
Uh, the thing that's happening on Friday, the game looks fun. I actually went in and played the demo, and I was like, oh, this actually seems pretty cool.

24
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:04,889
The game is The Serpent Rogue. It actually looks really fun. Uh, it's something that looks pretty interesting.

25
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:15,960
It's all about the money, isn't it? I thought it was going to be a different game.

26
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:29,129
No, and, uh, okay, let me be really clear with this. Sponsors on this stream, I'm going to be pretty selective on, right?

27
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:37,689
If something looks like it's something I'd be interested in, something that I think would be cool, or that I think would be, oh, this looks like it might be fun to play,

28
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:46,730
then yeah. If there's an opportunity, then yeah. But I'm not just going to do something just because, just to do it. That's just not going to happen.

29
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:55,449
Um, so I would rather have those things happen naturally than just, oh yeah, sure, I'll do anything.

30
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:02,490
Um, so I can at least try to tell you that anything that's a sponsor on this stream is something that I have, like, used before,

31
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:09,050
something that I thought was interesting, or that I thought, like, actually that makes sense. I could kind of gel with the community, right?

32
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:17,029
So, I mean, every sponsor is going to be, yes, I'm sponsored to play it, yes, I'm sponsored to show it,

33
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:25,720
but I have the opportunity to be able to say yes or no, every time. Um, so, we should run ads as well.

34
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,389
Mmm, I, let's not, let's not talk, let's not get there yet. Let's not, uh, let's not get there yet.

35
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:40,149
I don't, I don't think so. I don't think that's going to have to happen, for any reason.

36
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,230
Yeah, The Serpent Row, it looks fun. It looks actually really cool. It's a game where it's like you, like an action adventure where you make potions and shit.

37
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,689
I actually looked, I was looking, you know, play the demo. Seems pretty good.

38
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:58,680
Yet, no. Can you monetize your breath yet?

39
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,560
Alright, I unlocked some people. I want to show you who they are because they're cool.

40
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:13,620
Uh, I unlocked this guy, Ramba. This, oh soul. This was pretty cool, this dog. I'm excited, you deserve the opportunities.

41
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:34,149
But I don't, I don't want to just do it just to do it, right? And, I mean, eventually, some of the idea behind some of this stuff is, okay, subs and bits don't, like, you guys don't, like, need to do that, right?

42
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:43,500
If I get to a point where I'm making more money through sponsorships, then subs, do you guys, I can, you can just fucking watch, you know what I mean?

43
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,230
Um, and you don't have to worry about that. And even now, even right now, you don't have to worry about that.

44
00:06:50,230 --> 00:07:01,370
So, I'm trying to make a reasonable balance. And, obviously, obviously, I'm trying to make some money too.

45
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:11,139
Because, not just for the big shows, right? Because big shows really are expensive. And some of these shows are half, kind of, paid for, but not really.

46
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:22,620
And then, we have to figure out how to get the rest. Uh, but some of these opportunities, some of these projects, I mean, they're, they're potentially in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Hundreds of thousands.

47
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:33,750
So, I want to make sure that I'm going to be able to pay for them and, like, not have to worry about it, right? So, that's the long and short of it.

48
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:53,079
I want to try to be transparent. This greedy motherfucker. Don't worry about it, bro. Yeah, I, but I've never done it before. Ever.

49
00:07:53,079 --> 00:08:06,329
And it's something that I always said if I was going to ever do it, that I would want to make sure I was, kind of, on my own terms, right?

50
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:21,240
I unlock these too, yeah. All right, let's do XP. A lot of XP. Cool Down, Area, and Speed, and Magnet.

51
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:33,269
And, and don't, don't get me wrong, like I said, there, there's been at least a few opportunities that I've just been, like, uh, uh-uh. No, I don't think so.

52
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,960
Just straight up. And that's going to continue to happen, all right? I'm going to, that's going to keep happening.

53
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:52,629
Okay, so I need to survive on green acres. This is going to be hard. Random enemy waves from normal stages and enemy health plus 50%. This is going to be fucking hard.

54
00:08:52,629 --> 00:09:14,039
All right, let's go for it. Enjoy your bitrate. So, uh, this dog spits out these flowers that shoot up behind you. They're pretty cool. This music is pretty good, too.

55
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:20,519
160p. That was a good title. What was wrong with that one? Oh, I unlocked this too. This is, uh, these are guns.

56
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:44,809
Fires quickly in four fixed directions. See if I can get both. Why are you fighting the Woj, Soy Wojak? This is 50% more health than random enemies. I haven't even tried this one.

57
00:09:44,809 --> 00:10:01,029
Uh, I mean, I love lightning. Lightning Rod is like the best. But that's Friday, and Friday we were thinking of doing the Elden Ring PvP stuff, but I gotta, I gotta talk to Ludwig because we gotta figure out how that's going to play out.

58
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:29,899
I think we need a little bit more time. Oh God. Yeah, we'll chill for a little bit. I'll play around to see if I can beat the game at least once. They have way more health. This actually is kind of hard.

59
00:10:29,899 --> 00:11:02,139
So the next stream will be on Friday. That's what I'm planning on. Okay. Damage? What do I have? I need the Duplicator Ring, the other gun. I need Tiramisu. I don't think the flower has an evolve. I think I'm just going to finish. Just damage.

60
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:26,570
Use the knife, oh God. But to cap the sponsor thing, there's like a few streams this year that I really want to do, and I need to be able to pay for them. Stuff that I've always wanted to do, stuff that I've like, that I really care about.

61
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:46,840
And I've said this to you guys before, and I have to reiterate it sometimes. The stuff that keeps me interested is what keeps me in this chair. And that stuff, doing those shows, doing the big stuff, is what is keeping me interested. That's what keeps me interested.

62
00:11:46,919 --> 00:12:33,370
So, I want to try to do the things that I want to try to do. Turn up the game audio? Oh, I don't even know what I just bought. What was it? What happened? What did I just buy? I think it was another level of something? What was it? I'm crashing again. He's gone. Oh, actually gone.

63
00:12:33,370 --> 00:13:11,539
Hello? Oh no, he left the chair. He took the money and ran. He left the chair. I really hope you guys understand that the last 10 to 15 seconds is probably the most important.

64
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:45,580
Thing I've ever said in my entire life on stream. Ever. I really just hope you guys understand. The last probably 15 seconds is the most important. Ever. Glad you got to hear it. Oh, I like the- Oh, these guys respawn. Oh my god, I'm gonna die. I need some help.

65
00:13:45,659 --> 00:14:27,340
You know what I mean? That is so important to me. That is so important to me. That is like the most important thing. It's so important to me that you guys, that I can talk to you like this.

66
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:51,000
At the last minute, I've never said anything like that. Ever. To anybody, let alone people on a stream. I'm really glad that you got to hear it. The last 20 to 30 seconds again, I've never talked like that to anybody. I'm so glad that I could say it to you.

67
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,690
Oh, I'm so happy I could get it off my chest.

68
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,769
I think my internet's like fucked up right now. It's like 10 o'clock at night. What's happening here?

69
00:15:17,769 --> 00:16:05,129
Ooh, I'll take the fire wand. Sorry, I'm kind of playing like shit. I'm just making sure my stream is still up.

70
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:18,460
Are we good? All right. I gotta pay attention because I have this fucking random shit.

71
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:51,220
You're stuck? Well, refresh. Yeah, refresh. We're good.

72
00:16:51,220 --> 00:17:08,819
All right. There we go. Level two. Good chest. No.

73
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,829
Hey dude, erectile dysfunction is rare. You're not alone.

74
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:35,140
All right. Stop looking at your chat. Yeah, I know. I'm just like looking at the bitrate. I'm just concerned.

75
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:42,640
All right. There we go. All right. I can evolve this now.

76
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,140
The tiramisu is a revive, but it also evolves the gun.

77
00:17:49,140 --> 00:18:20,940
Why is everybody omega lowing? Why is everybody omega lowing? Omega lowing?

78
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:56,299
Why is everybody omega lowing? Whatever. It's art.

79
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:03,700
I think if you have, if I get at least two more of these, I think I'll be fine.

80
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,079
I hope so. Yeah. I mean, why is there omega low?

81
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,940
Chest. Nice.

82
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:32,670
Ooh, actually, I got the upgrade. That's cool. That's pretty cool.

83
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:42,640
I might have to restart the run. This is not a great one.

84
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,250
I got hit. I don't know why. Why is my chat being weird?

85
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,109
Why can I not see the chat anymore? This is weird.

86
00:19:51,109 --> 00:20:19,170
He's back. What? Oh, chat back up, please.

87
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:42,779
That was so emotional. Sorry, mods. I apologize.

88
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:50,529
I think I can salvage this, actually. Yeah, I'm dead.

89
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:59,420
Oh, I have a revive. That's right. Oops.

90
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,980
Sorry, I was too busy looking over. Is that a joke?

91
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,890
Um, I don't know what it looked like.

92
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:21,789
I'm trying to see what it looked like.

93
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:31,980
You suck at this. No, I'm just not paying that much attention.

94
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,730
Wait, did it, was I in the chair?

95
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:46,039
There was a point when I was not in the chair, right?

96
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:57,410
Have I been, wait, have I been in the chair the whole time?

97
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,930
Like, I have been sitting in this chair the whole time.

98
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:11,210
You were always in the chair. Really?

99
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:19,210
I, I killed the internet and like got out of frame and it came back.

100
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,980
And it was live for like 30 seconds.

101
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,980
And then I turned the internet, I could switch the internet again.

102
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,480
I turned it back on and I was sitting in the chair again.

103
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,779
But it didn't work.

104
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,299
I never left the chair.

105
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,299
How? That makes no sense.

106
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:44,230
Dude, I was live with the chair for at least a minute, at least.

107
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:50,569
Like, I was not in the chair.

108
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,569
And I crawled around the bottom.

109
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:56,569
I wonder if it's, if it's here, like on my OBS.

110
00:22:56,569 --> 00:22:58,569
Because I will show you.

111
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,569
I will, oh, it got eaten by the buffer.

112
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:15,569
But no, if I did that once, the other like 15 times, it would not have killed me.

113
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:25,990
I did it one time because I was like, whatever, it's happening every fucking 30 seconds anyway.

114
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:37,509
All of them were legitimate.

115
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,509
Like, my internet just fucked up right now.

116
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:43,579
Except for the one that I tried to go away from the chair.

117
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:49,599
Yeah, these are real.

118
00:23:49,599 --> 00:24:05,920
Let me try to salvage this one.

119
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
I can.

120
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:15,369
Let's get some health and I should be alright.

121
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:37,960
Nevada is a wasteland.

122
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,500
Okay.

123
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,990
I died on purpose because I want to do a real one.

124
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:49,700
Let's go.

125
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,640
New title?

126
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,160
We lost like 5k viewers from that.

127
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Well, I mean, I get, I mean, it's like a 10 o'clock at night Pacific.

128
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,160
My internet's being a piece of shit.

129
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,910
Oh, I'm telling, I swear only one of those was a joke.

130
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,910
The other 15 were real.

131
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,910
So I figured it was like, alright, this is just happening anyways.

132
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,910
I just want to try to do something funny with it.

133
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,890
Alright, perfect.

134
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,890
Let's go.

135
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:26,019
This is the real one.

136
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:28,779
This is the one I'm going to win.

137
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:29,779
Alright, good, good, good, good, good.

138
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,819
Good, good, good.

139
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:31,819
I want the whip.

140
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:53,460
It feels like every time there's an Elden Ring stream there's bandwidth problems.

141
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
That is fucking weird.

142
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Sorry, I'm just swearing.

143
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,160
That is very, that's odd.

144
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Why is that?

145
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Right?

146
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
That's very strange.

147
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:12,660
Okay, definitely want, I'll take the sand and water.

148
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:26,950
Give me these.

149
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,829
There we go.

150
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,829
Duplicator.

151
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:30,829
Hell yeah.

152
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:45,589
Evolve that into the super lightning and we'll be good to go.

153
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,589
Circular motions are really good with this because they spread around.

154
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:51,930
Just gives you like a little defense.

155
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,470
I think so.

156
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:57,710
Good.

157
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,950
Upgraded Santa Destroy into water, whatever.

158
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,950
More heroes.

159
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:08,180
Also, keep in mind I'm playing on the hard mode where the enemies have 50% more health.

160
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:16,650
I gotta try to survive 30 minutes.

161
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:30,109
I want that.

162
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,109
Alright.

163
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,670
Uhh, definitely that one.

164
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,980
Upgraded dusting.

165
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,470
Looks much better.

166
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:55,819
Uhh, more dusting.

167
00:27:55,819 --> 00:28:06,910
This is not bad.

168
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:16,049
Ooh, nice.

169
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:17,049
Even more projectiles.

170
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,930
Very, oh, that's okay.

171
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,930
Okay, okay, that's okay.

172
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,930
Very good.

173
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:41,279
Very good.

174
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
This is to do the song of mana, right?

175
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,349
Is this part simulator?

176
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,589
Uhh, no, this is better.

177
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:57,170
Bad, sorry.

178
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:04,779
Jerma does not read his chat.

179
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,779
Every time you see me go like this, I'm looking at chat.

180
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,779
Like here is like the top of the chat.

181
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,410
Here is the bottom of chat.

182
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,410
This is me looking at me.

183
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,900
What's going on, dude?

184
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
How you doing?

185
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,079
Doing pretty good.

186
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,730
Here I am.

187
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:41,740
More.

188
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Pass through more enemies.

189
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,180
Alright, this is looking like it's gonna play out pretty well.

190
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,390
I'm happy with this.

191
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,640
More dusting.

192
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,839
Dusting kind of sucks early, but it's really great later.

193
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,940
I just did.

194
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:14,400
Ooh, alright, okay, okay, okay.

195
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,369
I want the other gun, because now I'm gonna shoot double.

196
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:25,549
And now I need the tiramisu and this thing can get upgraded again.

197
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:43,019
I can't put my finger, but Jerma looks weird tonight.

198
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:46,019
Looks like he's got facial reconstruction surgery.

199
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,700
What the fuck, man?

200
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
What the fuck?

201
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,329
What the hell?

202
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:57,329
Dude, what the fuck?

203
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:03,599
That's so fucking weird.

204
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,910
I see it.

205
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,740
It's the fucking hair.

206
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,789
I don't know what it is.

207
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,180
You guys are crazy.

208
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:29,740
My whip.

209
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:48,420
I didn't say it was bad.

210
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:58,890
Yeah, but that's kind of like implied that I got a bunch of surgery on my face.

211
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:07,309
You look like you're wearing somebody else's skin.

212
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:23,849
Look at the spam here.

213
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:24,849
This is awesome.

214
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:29,259
I need a couple evolutions now.

215
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:32,259
Otherwise, by 10 minutes, this is gonna be a disaster.

216
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,230
It's the...

217
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,230
Okay, you know what it is?

218
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:38,269
The fact that the light in the room is off.

219
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:40,269
The ring light is on.

220
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,450
And I haven't had a haircut.

221
00:32:42,450 --> 00:33:13,680
I just thought about that guy that said,

222
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,519
Oh, hey, dude, what's the baseball stream?

223
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,519
I'm like a new viewer.

224
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,890
And then Ball Fondler replied and said,

225
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,890
Oh, dude, at least he's gonna shove an entire baseball up his ass.

226
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,829
And more than I was thinking about this,

227
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,829
and me and Holly were talking about this,

228
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,829
we're laughing our asses off about this because it's like,

229
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:39,799
Why would I need four or five months of planning to do that?

230
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,799
Like, oh, here it is, guys, the big baseball stream.

231
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,799
And I shove a baseball up my ass.

232
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,940
Oh, guys, get hyped.

233
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,940
The baseball stream is in four months.

234
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,519
Why would it...

235
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,660
Why would I need to do that?

236
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Huh?

237
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:10,690
Oh, that's so fucking...

238
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:16,190
That's like so funny.

239
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,190
You have no idea.

240
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,650
And more than I think about that, it's just like,

241
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,690
Why?

242
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,989
Imagine me announcing that.

243
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,679
Guys, get hyped for the baseball stream.

244
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,679
Yo, baseball.

245
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,679
Yeah, what's gonna happen is I'm gonna be on camera

246
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,300
and I'm gonna shove a baseball up my ass.

247
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Fog, you fog champ, let's go.

248
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Uh, what?

249
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,250
I'm like hyping that up for months?

250
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:49,840
There's so many layers to why I think that that is really funny.

251
00:34:49,840 --> 00:35:01,269
And I'm like hyping it up for months.

252
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,269
And then I just get permanently banned in 10 seconds.

253
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,309
Like, what did I...

254
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,309
What do you think is going to happen?

255
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:11,130
Why would that ever be something that you get hyped about?

256
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,460
Insane.

257
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,369
There's so many layers.

258
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,369
I just can't...

259
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,369
That's such an onion...

260
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,369
Oh, it's a joke.

261
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,739
All right, I want the whip, yo.

262
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:46,820
Look at how good the gun is.

263
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
It's insane.

264
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
It's so good.

265
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Crazy stream this has been, huh?

266
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,769
This has been wild.

267
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:04,769
There's been a few wild ones over the last week or two here.

268
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:12,510
They're getting a little wild.

269
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:23,289
I want the chest in here because I want to know where it is.

270
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:26,329
When I get full levels, I want to be able to upgrade something.

271
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:27,820
Okay, here we go.

272
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:43,659
Yeah, don't die.

273
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:52,360
All right, I got to collect stuff for the weapon.

274
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:01,789
All right, I need four...

275
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:15,360
And I also think about this stuff, too.

276
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,500
The guy that wrote that.

277
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,139
Like, what are you up to right now?

278
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,139
Like, what do you...

279
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,139
Like, what does your day look like today?

280
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,510
Are you doing good?

281
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,510
Like, you're just hanging out?

282
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,510
Like, what is the Ball Fondler's, like, theme today?

283
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,510
You know what I mean?

284
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,510
I'm kind of curious.

285
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,480
Is this a cooldown game?

286
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,219
Yeah, it is.

287
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:43,340
All right, come on.

288
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,380
All right, come on.

289
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:52,219
I hope the Ball Fondler's, like, doing good, you know?

290
00:37:52,219 --> 00:38:16,349
Okay, hold on.

291
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:27,829
Please give it to me.

292
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,900
All right, level eight.

293
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,300
Dust is now a heal.

294
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,659
Very big deal.

295
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:38,889
Almost have this maximum.

296
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,889
All right, that's one max.

297
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:41,889
Do I have them both maxed out?

298
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:42,889
I need a little bit more.

299
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:43,889
Getting there.

300
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:57,019
The dust is now healing the shitload, so it's really, really good.

301
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,420
Jesus.

302
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:10,590
I need something to evolve right now.

303
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,820
We're very soon.

304
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
I'm going to get overwhelmed.

305
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:38,329
All right, here's another chest.

306
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,369
There's another chest.

307
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:46,300
No chest?

308
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
All right, go.

309
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,360
Collectathon.

310
00:39:51,360 --> 00:40:03,420
Lightning.

311
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,039
More cooldown.

312
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,039
I want that.

313
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I want Santa water.

314
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
Okay, getting there.

315
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,139
Seven.

316
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,139
Done.

317
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,139
I need one more and done.

318
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:20,380
And then this thing goes crazy.

319
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:33,530
Lightning Ring.

320
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,980
I have Duplicator.

321
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Yeah, I do.

322
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,980
More cooldown.

323
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:51,110
More lightning.

324
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,139
Almost there.

325
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,639
Come on.

326
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,639
I'm almost halfway there.

327
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:03,739
Way too dank.

328
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,780
Actually, it is kind of loud.

329
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:12,659
Thanks for letting me know.

330
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:25,579
There's so many chests.

331
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:27,980
Just give me a max thing already.

332
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,980
Come on.

333
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:46,690
And then we can just coast.

334
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:47,690
I could open one of them, maybe.

335
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
That might be not a bad idea.

336
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,469
Oh, shit.

337
00:42:11,469 --> 00:42:13,800
Oh, shit.

338
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,030
All right.

339
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:25,690
Oh, okay.

340
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,690
These bats are the worst.

341
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:36,949
I need chicken.

342
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:45,530
Okay, back this way.

343
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:54,699
More chicken.

344
00:42:54,699 --> 00:43:04,139
Get it.

345
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:05,139
If I had a vacuum, this would be amazing.

346
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:11,820
Level eight.

347
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
There we go.

348
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,230
Perfect.

349
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,670
Hell yeah.

350
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:21,710
All right.

351
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,550
Now I need those chests.

352
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:33,920
And watch this.

353
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,800
Super gun.

354
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,809
The Fear Raggy.

355
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:39,809
Scales with revivals.

356
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,550
Watch this.

357
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,550
Yep.

358
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,550
Now I have another room for another weapon, too.

359
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,949
Lightning Rod.

360
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:54,949
Eight.

361
00:43:54,949 --> 00:43:55,949
Hell yeah.

362
00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:03,210
Go with whip.

363
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,510
Thunder.

364
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,510
Thunder Loop.

365
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,900
Evolve lightning.

366
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,900
Strikes twice.

367
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:19,650
Now I'm more confident that I'll be fine.

368
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,650
Area of attack?

369
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,059
I think I want that.

370
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,059
I need...

371
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:26,429
What do I need for this?

372
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:28,119
Yeah.

373
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,119
Actually, no.

374
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,960
Not yet.

375
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:34,119
I have to figure out what other weapon I want.

376
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:40,800
Whip again.

377
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Whip again.

378
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:49,250
Ooh, yep.

379
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,250
I'll take it.

380
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:58,119
There's another one there, too.

381
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:09,579
I'm going to save that other one as well.

382
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:15,679
It's on.

383
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,679
Because of the cooldown, it's on permanently.

384
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:34,179
Kind of distracting.

385
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:37,179
Maybe I should just get area and forget about another upgrade.

386
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:38,670
Because area would be...

387
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,670
This would just keep spreading out.

388
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:50,739
Play Bloons?

389
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,010
I think I did it.

390
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,010
Didn't I do it before?

391
00:45:54,010 --> 00:46:06,219
Do the whip.

392
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:16,530
Okay, so now I need to get Santa water up.

393
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,530
Bloons is fun.

394
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,530
I would play it.

395
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:30,059
I've got to think what else I want to do on Friday if we don't do the Elden Ring thing.

396
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:32,880
Because I'm doing the sponsor thing.

397
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,409
But I want to do something else, too.

398
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:40,289
I'll take a look.

399
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,289
New Bloons.

400
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,449
Or Inscription.

401
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:52,320
Play the new Bloons game, man.

402
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,619
Good luck.

403
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:58,699
Okay, I need...

404
00:46:58,699 --> 00:46:59,699
Almost there.

405
00:46:59,699 --> 00:47:01,460
Inscription.

406
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:18,699
Hey, B.

407
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:27,340
I feel like I have too much of a P-brain to do the later parts of Inscription.

408
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,340
I'm sure it's going to keep getting harder.

409
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,099
I'm just picking one of these up.

410
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:37,730
Paladins?

411
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:48,480
I'm going to wait and take that at the very end.

412
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
It's going to be insane.

413
00:47:49,480 --> 00:48:00,909
I'm killing things so fast, all the coins are spreading out too much.

414
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:27,559
Ten more minutes and that's it.

415
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,360
I just take this.

416
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,119
Whatever.

417
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,119
Tiramisu plus two.

418
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:57,869
This thing scales with revival, so now I have two.

419
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:07,760
So much health on the ground.

420
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:15,079
Now let's get the chest for one of them.

421
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:17,079
So what do I want for another weapon?

422
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,079
What do I have as upgrades?

423
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,090
What does the book do?

424
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,030
The book Wand?

425
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:34,630
I know everybody hates Wand, right?

426
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:47,519
Everybody hates Wand.

427
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,519
I even embrace her.

428
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:56,539
Oh, I didn't want to pick that up.

429
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:01,019
Still alive after getting hit by this?

430
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:03,030
Axe?

431
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,030
Yeah, Axe is probably a good idea.

432
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,909
If I get the Axe, I'll do Axe and...

433
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:08,909
Ooh, but wait.

434
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:13,739
I kind of want this.

435
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:29,789
Now I need the curse item, which I have.

436
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:31,789
I'm probably going to be untouchable, by the way.

437
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:34,800
No one's going to be able to get over here.

438
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh god, here we go.

439
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,699
Just don't move.

440
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:52,699
Play Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

441
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:59,159
You know, I watched a comprehensive lore video on Five Nights at Freddy's the other day.

442
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,940
I just did.

443
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:11,889
You know, the comfiest thing for me at this point is to just be in bed with my iPad and

444
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:19,730
watch just like 50 minute long comprehensive lore dissection videos on franchises that

445
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:25,849
I don't care about at all.

446
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:26,849
It's interesting to me.

447
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:27,849
I don't know why.

448
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,900
All right.

449
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,900
Give me the...

450
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,900
Okay.

451
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,900
Well, whatever.

452
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,900
I need the curse item.

453
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:42,079
It's not the curse item.

454
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,079
I could banish some.

455
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:58,730
I'm going to banish some stuff now because I don't want to see it.

456
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,900
You know what I think is probably interesting to me?

457
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,380
Because I know that there's a ton of people that are really, really interested in this.

458
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:13,449
And I almost get to sit there and be an observer saying, oh, I wonder what they're going to

459
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:14,449
think about that.

460
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:21,699
Will the community agree?

461
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:24,059
Please explain Five Nights at Freddy's.

462
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,739
Okay.

463
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:32,619
William Afton was co-owner of Freddy Fazbear Pizza or a different company or something.

464
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:33,619
And he ended...

465
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:34,619
Is this a spoiler?

466
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,949
I just want...

467
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,190
I need to prove that I've been watching.

468
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:50,519
William Afton had a son, Michael Afton, who went on to do something else or something.

469
00:52:50,519 --> 00:53:00,099
It ended up being that William Afton was a pretty bad guy and ended up...

470
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,300
Essentially, he was a...

471
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,619
Well, it was a spoiler for Five Nights at Freddy's, by the way.

472
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:05,860
So he was a serial killer.

473
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,619
He killed people.

474
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:08,619
And he would...

475
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,260
He killed them at the Freddy Fazbear restaurant.

476
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:16,380
Eventually, people got sick and tired of it, of him killing people.

477
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,969
And somebody got figured it out and killed him.

478
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,929
And then they stuffed him into a rabbit suit.

479
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:24,929
And then he can't...

480
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:26,530
He keeps coming back.

481
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:40,860
And he got killed like five times now or something.

482
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:58,900
And then his daughter is the doll in the game that is called Sister Location.

483
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,340
You dreamed this.

484
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,619
I did not dream this.

485
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:03,619
This is for real.

486
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,760
This is what happened.

487
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:16,420
Look at all these chests.

488
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,659
And then Freddy Fazbear becomes Tony the Tiger in the new game.

489
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:22,760
And he's good and helps you.

490
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,639
He's like, oh, I'm going to help you.

491
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:34,809
And he talks about like nutritional food and stuff and wants you to be like healthy.

492
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:35,809
I need...

493
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:50,849
Where's the curse item?

494
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:54,820
But who is Freddy Fazbear?

495
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,820
Who is Freddy Fazbear?

496
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,820
That's what I want to know.

497
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,340
A...

498
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,519
I don't know.

499
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:01,519
Who is Freddy Fazbear?

500
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,559
Who is Freddy Fazbear?

501
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,909
Tomar Raid.

502
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:06,909
What's up, Tomar?

503
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:11,670
Thanks for the raid.

504
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:12,670
Welcome, Tomar.

505
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,489
Late night vampire survivors.

506
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:15,489
Thanks for the raid.

507
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:19,289
I looked at like...

508
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,909
I looked you directly in the eyes.

509
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:21,909
Hey, thanks for the raid.

510
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:22,909
Does that feel weird?

511
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:23,909
Like when I look directly into the camera and point and address you?

512
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:27,519
I need to banish something because this is not what I want.

513
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:28,519
I always figured that...

514
00:55:28,519 --> 00:55:29,519
Okay, wait.

515
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:30,519
Pay attention.

516
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:32,909
This thing's going to kill me.

517
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:33,909
I always don't like looking directly in the camera because I feel like it freaks people

518
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:43,090
out.

519
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:44,090
I like looking just kind of barely off the camera.

520
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,389
Like...

521
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:46,389
Okay, wait.

522
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:47,389
Pay attention.

523
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:51,449
This thing's going to kill me.

524
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:54,650
I always don't like looking directly in the camera because I feel like it freaks people

525
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,650
out.

526
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,650
I like looking just kind of barely off the camera.

527
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,650
Like...

528
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,650
Looking this way.

529
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:05,969
What's happening?

530
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:08,619
Is that like...

531
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:09,619
Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.

532
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:10,619
That usually means something bad.

533
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:16,019
All right.

534
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:17,980
I got five minutes left and I win.

535
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,980
On the hard level.

536
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:24,949
Die!

537
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:25,949
Whoa!

538
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,150
That claw's huge.

539
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,150
Die!

540
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,949
I want to die!

541
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:44,690
Still haven't seen...

542
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,690
I got to start banishing other stuff.

543
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:53,880
Okay, this is where I'm going to see it.

544
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,880
Banish.

545
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:04,940
Well, I'm not going to get the upgrade, but I'll at least be able to get the...

546
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,940
There's luck, I guess.

547
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,820
Oh well.

548
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,500
I think this is a win, though.

549
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
It's going to be fine.

550
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,260
This thing has a lot of health.

551
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,510
There we go.

552
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:35,440
Finally.

553
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,440
Wait, what?

554
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,440
What does the title say?

555
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,440
Is it, I'm doing a speed run?

556
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,539
Money.

557
00:57:44,539 --> 00:57:51,900
To all the fellow EU watchers, good morning.

558
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,900
Yeah, good morning.

559
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,539
The title's horrible.

560
00:57:57,539 --> 00:57:58,539
What is the title?

561
00:57:58,539 --> 00:57:59,539
I didn't do it.

562
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:00,539
What's the title?

563
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:03,250
Who fucking did this?

564
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,250
Why?

565
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,250
How long has it been like this for?

566
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,250
No hacks?

567
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,250
Who did this?

568
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
I'm deleting it.

569
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,250
Have the mods just been adding stuff to the title?

570
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,250
For like the last hour?

571
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,250
Bring that up.

572
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,090
No, that wasn't me.

573
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,090
I didn't do that.

574
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,090
That wasn't me.

575
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:22,320
You know, I'm so absent-minded.

576
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:37,059
The mods could probably just do that every stream, and I would not know if you didn't

577
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:38,059
tell me.

578
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:42,719
I gotta try to get to level like 100.

579
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,719
Level 99 with the dog.

580
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:44,719
I think I'm too far away, but I can try.

581
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:45,719
Gotta stand still.

582
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:46,719
Can I get to 99 in two, three minutes?

583
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:47,719
But it's just money.

584
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:48,719
Whatever.

585
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:49,719
That's cool though.

586
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:56,719
Money done.

587
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:57,719
Mods rioting.

588
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:58,719
Come on, I need to get to level 99.

589
00:58:58,719 --> 00:58:59,719
I won't get there.

590
00:58:59,719 --> 00:59:03,969
But at least I'll win.

591
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:05,969
I need to get to level 99.

592
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:12,710
I won't get there.

593
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:35,070
But at least I'll win.

594
00:59:35,070 --> 01:00:04,460
Alright, this is where it's going to happen.

595
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:42,909
I sneak up here.

596
01:00:42,909 --> 01:01:03,369
Okay, don't be stupid about it.

597
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:41,849
One minute. I got it. What do you unlock for doing this? Oh my god. This is gonna get actually kind of scary

598
01:01:41,849 --> 01:02:29,780
I'm gonna keep moving. Don't let him collapse it 30 seconds. All right. I'm good. I got it. Five four three two one good

599
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:40,239
Yeah, cool. I'm what's going on here. Why is it so slow?

600
01:02:40,980 --> 01:03:10,880
It spawns another one right if you every minute or something my faster

601
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:24,530
I don't have any movement speed or any slow down do I but I know of flowers doing that. Oh

602
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:34,670
Oh

603
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,650
All right. Yeah, you can't win anyways

604
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:58,130
Yeah, you can't win. Oh, I got skip another skip and that's it six point two million from the

605
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:02,070
quad guns

606
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:09,909
Very cool. All right. I'll see you guys later. I'll see you guys on Friday Friday. We'll do some fun stuff

607
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:15,090
There will be a sponsor segment on Friday. I gotta talk to Ludwig and see what the plan is

608
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:19,510
We might do it Friday. We might move it. I probably gonna say we need to have another few days

609
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:34,349
We'll do some fun stuff. We'll play much stuff Friday afternoon. I'll update you. What's the title say? No, let's title say

610
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,929
Let me see what the title is before I leave

611
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:54,750
One down mods writing gone among us higher pH value stream kill stream chaotic neutral vibes plus ratio

612
01:04:55,190 --> 01:05:04,639
Do one of the mods get hacked? All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching

613
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:11,659
Thanks to the mods for helping do the Elden Ring stuff earlier

614
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,309
Thanks for you. Obviously for sticking around. Have a great night. That was fun

615
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:24,610
I've you know, I've really really like bounce around streams where it's like, alright, we got this

616
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:28,650
This is like a two-hour thing. This is like a couple hours. This is like two or three hours

617
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:35,139
I I like this a lot. I like kind of bouncing around they don't all have to be like this, but I like doing this

618
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:47,070
It's a lot of variety. I like it that scare that horror game was really really off-putting really terrifying. It was cool

619
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:58,369
Crazy experience. Give me some more of those kind of games. Give me some more of those kind of short horror experiences

620
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:02,809
I've missed a lot over the years. It's been a long time

621
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:15,730
There's a solid half dozen or at least dozen or so of those two ish hour three ish hour

622
01:06:15,969 --> 01:06:25,050
Horror experiences that I'd like to play some more. They're interesting

623
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:30,960
I completely forgot about the barf drinker and juggles and all the other Elden Ring. That was so much fun

624
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,610
I'll see you guys on Friday

625
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:39,650
Keep an eye on the sus because I'll update what's gonna happen and keep an eye on the discord, too

626
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:56,579
I will converse with Ludwig. We'll see what's gonna happen. Your hair is fine, by the way

627
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:02,340
Don't let chat make you self-conscious. Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I know everyone's just walking around. I have to all right

628
01:07:02,659 --> 01:07:18,320
I'm good. I wonder what was going on with the internet. It's weird

629
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:24,269
I'd say once every two or three weeks

630
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:29,429
There'll be one night where I just randomly every hour will just start dropping frames for like a minute or two straight

631
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:33,480
It's completely rock solid the rest of the time though

632
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:42,929
I would imagine it probably has to do with a VPN because I stream with a VPN a lot of times

633
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:51,639
They're gonna do some more recruiting for the Elden Ring stuff. I want to it's probably gonna happen offline

634
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,750
Just because of how difficult it was to kind of manage

635
01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:02,690
The amount of people that we're trying to join so keep an eye on the discord. I'll keep you guys updated

636
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:16,630
Well, you know, I'll see you guys soon. Take care. See you Friday

637
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:25,479
Regardless of what we do. See you soon
