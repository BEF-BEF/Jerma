1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:26,539
And I have to... This beautiful kafamari. Can you see it? No, you can't. But why? Oh, there we go.

2
00:00:30,379 --> 00:01:00,219
I think it's working. Ears are be noticed. That's really loud, sorry. Hold on. Almost ready!

3
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,549
Make my audio delayed. Just watch the video.

4
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:24,569
My flash? No? You guys are gonna tell me it's in sync though. But I'm not gonna really tell.

5
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,299
It should be pretty close.

6
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:45,290
Be updated. All right, let's start.

7
00:01:45,849 --> 00:02:18,539
I'm sorry, I just skipped. I do have the DLC for this game too. Why? Because I just did. Painfully

8
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:41,050
low on data. There we go. The ball flew open away into the depths of the great cosmos,

9
00:02:41,050 --> 00:03:00,039
leaving a great hole in the sky. Oh dear. King made a black hole playing tennis. Consumed the

10
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:24,759
whole planet. All suffered the same fate. They all got sucked in. That's not good. Have I played this

11
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:34,650
one before? Maybe. I don't remember. I've just... I don't remember. I never played this game enough

12
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:46,699
to remember anything about it. Well, this is a pickle. Daikon, dill, and cabbage. Sorry.

13
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:59,430
Most of the stars in the cosmos are gone. This is where we come in. We always save the day.

14
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:15,060
Side by side, we'll save the cosmos. But you're the sidekick. Just so that's clear. Do you want to

15
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:27,209
cape bunny ears and wings? Anyhow, we want you to assist us with this one. By a stroke of luck,

16
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:41,209
Earth is still there. So go roll lots and lots of ginormous katamaris. We'll do the hard work

17
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:54,699
of turning them into stars. We'll take care of that pesky black hole too. Ready to turn out some

18
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:16,500
colossal katamaris? Okay, time to get going. The cosmos needs our help. Yeah, this is not the

19
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,579
remake. This is... This is like katamari three or four, isn't it? Maybe even five. What does this

20
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:32,810
sit in release? Three? Four? Four. Okay. Rolling practice. You know the basics. Yes, I actually do.

21
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:43,689
That's all right. We can teach you Wii moon brain. Roll! Katamari 101. Presenting the

22
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:48,889
astonishing katamari. Sleek! Roll it. Pick it up stuff. Grow bigger. Repeat. If you do well,

23
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:55,850
this katamari will become a moon. Profound, yes. We have that effect on everyone. Give it a spin

24
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:07,500
and pop it on top of that platform. You ready? Roll. Roll. Roll. Roll backwards. Roll sideways.

25
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:17,399
Roll up and over object. There we are. All right. Not hideous at all. Enjoy yourself.

26
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,000
And now there's a big mess of stuff all around. Such odd shapes they have downright disturbing.

27
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Anywho, roll them up with the katamari, please. The katamari will start to get bigger and bigger.

28
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:41,449
It's all very strangely satisfying. Who knew? Yes, I remember. It feels so wonderful.

29
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:59,420
This is as satisfying as pulling up chest hairs with a tweezer. Did I just say that out loud?

30
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:16,230
Holy hornbeam! That box you rolled up is a present. From us to you with love. We know you need a

31
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:24,620
treat. Thanks for the present. Picking up the puzzles now. Now we can start taking over this.

32
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:36,139
What 10 centimeters you say? Getting bigger. Do a dash. Quick turn is the middle portion of

33
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:45,029
the buttons. This is you can go really, really, really fast. There we are. Look. I can move around

34
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:52,740
with the royal look. Let's see what you look like. Cool. And then there's looking from the prince's

35
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:08,199
perspective. Apparently out the door. Got it. I want to get all the pink puzzles. All useful and

36
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:19,769
necessary. So practice, practice, practice. Oh, nice and big. That'll make a nice moon.

37
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:24,889
And now the finishing touch. Roll up Marcy. What have you seen? That's weird or not.

38
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,829
Marcy is just hiding somewhere as usual. My money is on that big ball thing. Difficult word.

39
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:52,620
Once you roll up Marcy, you're done with practice. Let's get Marcy. Marcy. Did I get you?

40
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,720
Got you. You're done with practice. Marcy is rolled up. Remember how to roll now,

41
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:18,820
come and practice anytime. Back to the prince-dom now. Royal rainbow. These games are so fun.

42
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:34,460
Welcome home. So we got you to roll this moon for practice. Was it crazy hard? Not so much. Ah,

43
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,179
hubris. Hey, this Katamari is regular size. It's the wrong one too. Boo. We ordered a large.

44
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:50,230
Envelope, please. Points total time. Let's see. 63 points. Such an ordinary score. Was that

45
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,429
Kalasari? It's okay. Normal is back in vogue. It's the new black. Inside sources reveal.

46
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:08,539
Prince has a penchant for weird things. Back up, we see. A present. An ambiguous accessory for you

47
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:15,320
to make your own. We'll keep it safe in the cake in the prince-dom. There should be lots more

48
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:25,690
accoutrements, so enjoy. A dazzle of color Marcy and none other. Lost again. The Pantone party is

49
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:37,289
in the prince-dom. Yay for a star. Uhuru. That one piece sticking out the top is annoying me.

50
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:54,870
That was barely worth it. Here's an idea you can do better. Are you the chat? That's a chat saying.

51
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:20,039
Okay, so I can walk around. Are we good?

52
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,840
Alrighty, here we are. This is the prince-dom. Your not-so-secret base. Are you thrilled? Dizzy?

53
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:34,519
It's okay to throw up. We made it just for you, a custom tailored star. It's small and precious,

54
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:41,000
just like you are to us. We'll keep adding to it more places to play. When your cousins come over,

55
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,279
they can live here. We made you houses too, so go inside each one, yes? Explore and play our little

56
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:56,570
prince. The prince-dom is where wishes come true. This just in. The prince-dom is now bigger. Check

57
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,850
out the new places. There's a photo album, presents, and other things. We also added a totally

58
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:08,730
fab place for you to play. We gave it the best name, the big tripper. Takes you on a voyage of

59
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:16,649
light and sound. See? Now you can make new stars again. Twinkle twinkle. Extra extra. A new area

60
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:23,100
has opened up in the prince-dom. A place of icy beauty called Sub-Zero. Watch your step, it's very

61
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,139
slippery. You can make new Katamaris there, so roll away. Attention shoppers! There's a new area

62
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:36,700
in the prince-dom. It's called the Tropic Quasar. So pretty and warm, just stuffed with flowers.

63
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,059
There's fun new things to play with too. It's the prince-dom 2.0. Go have a launch party.

64
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:51,269
Excuse us. Seems to be more colonies. Oh, did you go shopping Xbox Live Marketplace, yes?

65
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:56,629
Fabulous! Now you can make new stars again. Go pop into a colony and get a star maker.

66
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:02,789
Remember the present you rolled up just now? Those gifts you find are all in the presents.

67
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:08,950
It's that house shaped like a yummy cake. We'll pop all the presents in there from now on.

68
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:35,590
But right now you should try on your new gift. Let me try it on. How do I try it on? Does it

69
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:49,940
have to be like on a certain run? It says I have it, maybe it's just on. Is it on me? I got scammed.

70
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,019
Oh. All right, Xbox Live Marketplace. I already bought everything you can buy,

71
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,019
except for all the stupid shitty things. All right, save and load. Let's save it.

72
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:13,240
No, I'm not going to buy the cousins. They're like a dollar fifty each and they don't do anything.

73
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:26,779
Sound and vibration. Actually, turn off vibration. I hate vibration.

74
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:42,570
Collection. Oh man. Well, that's a lot of data. And then here is a photo album.

75
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:58,389
I don't have any photos. Wait, is that the camera? No. Unable to edit photo data. No great new photo

76
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:09,190
data. This music is freaking me out. I don't have any photos though. How do I take a photo? Pick up.

77
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:22,470
Maybe I have to take pictures. I love the giraffes. Okay, let's go. That's multiplayer.

78
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,669
And then this is online battle. I don't, that don't exist no more. What's this?

79
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:39,159
This is Fancy and Schmancies. Create a space station within the budget. This is DLC.

80
00:15:48,779 --> 00:16:00,039
Egg School. Learn the basic controls. No. Munchies Manor. Roll up food to make

81
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:08,440
Cetus. All right, so this is this is DLC. No. All right, so where's like the regular just game?

82
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,230
One of these little huts over here. Just go to the cosmos. Oh, okay.

83
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:26,840
Fly to the cosmos. Welcome to the cosmos is an existence delish. Here you can look at all the

84
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,879
stars you made. Use a left stick then a A button to look closer. You can look at all the leaderboards

85
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,159
The queen wrote us a note about it. So here we go.

86
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,759
Hello, darling king. Hello, sweet Marcy. Here's a quick sketch of the leaderboards for you. I don't

87
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:50,039
want to see the leaderboards. For each star you make, Katamarius gets the data. But only if you

88
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,799
have an online connection. Data from all over the world comes to Katamarius. So who made the

89
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:01,639
loveliest star of them all? The leaderboards will tell you. Close look at each star shows its score too.

90
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,799
Simple. Sure. She sends us kisses. Great. Play around with it. It's the best way to learn. Sure.

91
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:15,349
Oh, and press the B button to go back to Princeton. Sure. Okay. Moon. Everyone's Katamari.

92
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:39,400
What is this? Everyone's Katamari. Okay. What's that? That's like a password hash. I got like

93
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,509
scared for a second. I was like, does that make my personal identifier? Um, I don't think I have to

94
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:54,460
be here. Oh, right here. Dangerous colony. Roll up dangerous objects. No, that's DLC.

95
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:07,829
Is this not DLC? Lovers loom. Roll up fabric to make Vega. DLC? I don't know. I'm just gonna

96
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:23,880
go on this one. This is also DLC. Um, how do I play just the regular game? Go to the first island.

97
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:34,259
Hubble horoscope? Does it matter? Well, I think it's meant to be played after, right? This is

98
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:52,779
DLC? What is this? Mechanical colony. That's DLC. Am I gonna ever find this? The green island? This

99
00:18:52,779 --> 00:19:02,299
one here. It's all DLC. Delightful dribble next to egg skull is not DLC. Okay. All right, all right,

100
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:20,650
all right, all right, all right. Munchies manor. Here it is. Delightful dribble. Go. That's all

101
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:30,259
DLC, man. This is DLC. Oh, who cares? Welcome to the thrilling delightful dirigible. Roll a great

102
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:39,690
Katamari here and you get a satellite. We require lots of stuff that has to do with play, like toys

103
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,559
and dolls and games and balls. May as well make it a fun satellite. You have to go to Cosmos?

104
00:19:46,200 --> 00:20:00,740
This is fucking DLC. He's doing it out of order. That's why I didn't want to do the DLC.

105
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:16,539
This is not DLC. This one isn't DLC. I'm just gonna do this one. All right, roll time. Candy store

106
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:24,700
full of sweets and toys and everything. Delish. Maybe we'll get a treat. Yeah, this is the first

107
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,349
level. Okay, this, yeah, yeah. Oh, the Katamari. If you roll up this big in this much time in

108
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:36,789
20 centimeters in three minutes, then it's a lolly good job. Roll up playfully. Today's challenge is

109
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:51,079
to make a playful satellite. We'll be back if you need us. Be good and play nice. Let's go. 20

110
00:20:51,079 --> 00:21:03,029
centimeters. All right, get off the screen. One yen coin. Hmm, very encouraging. Yes.

111
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:27,130
I'm gonna try with the rats. I can pick up the crayons. Oh, I can't climb that yet. Oh, shit.

112
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:39,049
Come on, get me in this. I can't climb all the way in? Ooh, red crayon. Your inaugural crash

113
00:21:40,089 --> 00:22:22,569
from E20. I have like one minute to do this. Shit. Pick it all up. 10 centimeters. All the way up.

114
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:35,210
Come on, there's gotta be something up here. All right, here we go. Into the fridge. All right,

115
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:48,200
just get off. Get off this and just start rolling on the ground. Under one minute remaining.

116
00:22:52,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Get all the rats. Come on. Over to the toys. There we go. Hurry, hurry, hurry. I'm going.

117
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:30,730
I'm going. I only have like another one centimeter. Go. Oh, shit. I'm stuck. Oh, 18, 19. Come on.

118
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:48,779
No. No. I'm gonna lose. Go in there. Yes. Kind of fast. There's still time. Plump it up now.

119
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,539
This is like your first real achievement, yeah? The first time you met our size time request.

120
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,059
We are so proud. Maybe we'll bronze this one. You can return to the Princeton

121
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,109
by pressing start. From there, we'll make the Katamari into a slug.

122
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,309
You can also continue rolling to make even bigger Katamari. The choice is yours.

123
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:35,740
We're going back anyway. It's really soon here. Dang it, chat. What is this dang it, chat? Oh,

124
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:52,460
whatever. Hello again. Sputter Nick. Feeling orbital. Is the satellite a go? Did you get a

125
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:59,700
lot of play things like we asked? Space toys, you know. Got a Katamari to show us? Bring it out.

126
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,420
This is 20 centimeters and eight millimeters. Here's what's in there.

127
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:14,019
Playtime, snacks, and rich. The top ingredients are play things. Yes, looks like you managed to

128
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:21,190
get some stuff. So we asked you to roll a playful sort of stuff. Hello. There's no play in there.

129
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:28,099
All work. Playtime is number one and snacks is number two. Let me see with dull boy, doesn't it?

130
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:36,619
Were you even listening? Such a killjoy. Now for a bonus bean count. Well, let's see.

131
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,559
14 points. Is this on purpose? Like for a documentary? If you don't shape up,

132
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:50,470
we'll ask Prince for help instead. Is this for a documentary? What a dick.

133
00:25:52,380 --> 00:26:13,509
Doesn't take up that much space. You're a party pooper. Learn to roll better. All right, that one's

134
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:20,019
done. What about over here? Nothing else over here?

135
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:43,640
The tea kettle? Oasis Cafe. All right, roll up drinks to make mercury. Welcome to Oasis Cafe,

136
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,579
a rest for the wicked. For you, more work. Help us make mercury. We need lots and lots of things to

137
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:54,619
drink. Like water, juice, tea, milk. Mercury should be plump and juicy.

138
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:07,529
Like peeled grapes. Mmm. What skin tastes weird. Off to Earth. See you later. Now connecting to

139
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:26,380
Seoul, Beijing. I didn't even see the last one. They did surgery on a grape. Time to roll. We're

140
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,900
in a candy store. Love mom and pop places. They're yummy and cheap. Are you going to eat that because

141
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,099
if you aren't? Oh yeah, right. The Katamari. If you're old to be this big, 50 centimeters

142
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:45,049
in five minutes. A little juice. Lots of drinks. Water, tea, juice. Don't drink too much. There's

143
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:56,220
no bathroom. All right, let's get every piece up here. Or at least 50, 60 percent of them.

144
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:16,059
It's a really good early game. Turn the music up. I don't know. Nobody even said that, but I assume

145
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:41,259
they did. All right, I need drinks. Okay, what about over here? That's a good start. Except

146
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:46,789
there's weird, there's like animals up here. What the hell is this thing? Frogs?

147
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:13,700
Present. Let's make our way down. It's a present. So what's in it? Do we know? I gotta get all those

148
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:28,599
drinks. 15 plus. All right, there we go. Can I get in there? That's a chunk.

149
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:46,789
I got like four minutes. You can relax. Bigger Katamari means you can leave the shop.

150
00:29:48,569 --> 00:30:00,869
Does, but not yet. Not big enough to get that. Of course not. I need drinks. I gotta pick up

151
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:17,700
every pallet of drink. All right, let's get up. We asked you to bake. All right, King, can you like

152
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:27,589
fucking come through like the PlayStation 4 controller speaker? Not big enough. Loading eggs

153
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:40,339
give you. I need more drinks. Back in the store. Or at least over here. Does that really even matter?

154
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:58,920
I don't think it does. Water. Nope. All right, back in the store. Wait, there's like a grocery store

155
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:23,259
right here. Holy shit, that's a lot. Up on the shelf. Get it. I'm almost there. Am I on the grill?

156
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:37,750
Yeah, I'm rolling over the grill. Back outside. I'm gonna go back in here. No.

157
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:54,599
50. All right, all right. Back in the store. I want to get back in here. Can I get in there anymore?

158
00:31:54,599 --> 00:32:10,809
I'm not sure I can even go in here. Ah, whatever. Not a strike. Reset the whole thing.

159
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:35,099
Eat the kid. You can't. I'm not big enough. All the candy apples. Check this out. Come on, I need those.

160
00:32:37,690 --> 00:33:10,440
Yeah. 65. Your Katamari is as big as 6,000 squids. Let me do you a favor here. Turn the volume up.

161
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:21,190
You need that mercury. You managed to get lots of things to drink.

162
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,089
Mercury fluid. A quick silver planet. Got a Katamari to show us.

163
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:34,069
Oh, bring it out. This is the Katamari. A mere 65 centimeters. Snacks, drinks, food.

164
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:42,970
Top ingredients are snacks. Looks like you managed to get some stuff. Hardly any drinks.

165
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:53,319
I'm gonna do this on purpose. 10 minutes.

166
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:12,599
A trace of earnestness. Aha, master of puni hero. All packed and labeled for a trip to the

167
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:19,380
prince. Yay for a star. Uhuru. I think that's kind of cool, isn't it?

168
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:34,730
Your party pooper learned to roll better. Two for ten gold.

169
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,579
All right, where's that other, where's the weirdo? I know they're called cousins,

170
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:55,590
but I just, I'm going to reference some of the weirdos. That's bad. New place?

171
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:08,949
Okay, so that's on. Looks pretty cool.

172
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:20,550
Game is so loud. Sorry. All right, where's the next, what's progression?

173
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:27,670
Is it that? Oh, this is Cafe. It's this one. This is DLC.

174
00:35:39,769 --> 00:36:00,760
Ain't nothing over here. Maybe the outside? Oops, noob.

175
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:20,489
Lady Luck Casino. There we go. This is DLC. I don't think it is. Doesn't it have a planet if it's DLC?

176
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:27,369
Roll a winning catamari and planet Venus arises. For that we need a lot of expensive stuff.

177
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:33,349
Metals, jewels, money. Are we right or are we not?

178
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:59,269
Yeah, the Saturn icon is DLC. Yeah, that's true. These games are just so relaxing.

179
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:11,429
Dead Rising 2 end game to this is like, there's one extreme to another. I'm just chilling right

180
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:21,510
now. It has a glam vibe. It's totally simpatico with us. Oh yes, the catamari. If you roll this

181
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:32,789
big 60 and 50. Let's go. Five minutes. Going straight for the cards, what do you think? Yeah.

182
00:37:32,789 --> 00:38:11,400
Hmm, almost there. I felt that one in my chest.

183
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,340
Can I get the scraperies? Yeah.

184
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,340
Wait, ship. Yep, I can get them.

185
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:57,989
When you run to something and you go, can I get that, can I get that, can I get that,

186
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:01,989
the answer is yes. It takes a whole day and a day.

187
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:21,079
Wait, the game's allowed? Did he say something? There, I got you.

188
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:38,309
Is this guy talking? I can't hear him. He's kind of behind.

189
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:09,099
A bigger catamari means you go outside now. I don't think I want to do that yet. Maybe I have to.

190
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,710
Yeah, I'm gonna go outside.

191
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,449
Is this technically outside? No, this is just a weirder wind inside.

192
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:43,309
Shit.

193
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,050
Uh oh, I gotta make something happen really, really, really soon here.

194
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:08,900
Oh, crap.

195
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:24,840
This is so itchy. I can't pick up the bearded dragon.

196
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:37,860
One minute. I'm almost, actually, that's just...

197
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:44,630
Going back in the house.

198
00:41:44,630 --> 00:42:00,650
Right here. Holy shit. Wow. Well, uh, I found a way to make that happen immediately.

199
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,219
Oh, go up the stairs quick. Go up the stairs. Look at that thing. I can't get it.

200
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,829
Oh, get upstairs. Look at all the stuff.

201
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,630
Yes!

202
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:33,800
And this shit just run in the direction and you'll get something. Oh, stuck.

203
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:52,280
Nice. Now you know why the game is so satisfying? Yeah, because you can go from

204
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:03,159
40 centimeters to like 100 in 12 seconds. Well, there's the expensive thing you wanted.

205
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:20,199
Gold bars, right? All right, this is from Venus. 90 centimeters. What do you got?

206
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:27,050
Games, rich, and snacks. Games. Yes, looks like you made it to get some stuff.

207
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,050
Hardly any expensive stuff. I just, that's like 50 million dollars worth of gold in there, man.

208
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:42,630
43 points. Stop pretending.

209
00:43:51,639 --> 00:44:02,969
That's nothing to a king. Doesn't take up much space. First cheat code Venus. Cheat code.

210
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:28,940
All right. Sunrise Castle. I'm making a comet now. If you roll the right, the cosmos gets a comet.

211
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:36,860
But you need a lots of Japanese things. Ninja, sushi, sukiyaki, bullet trains, and kimonos.

212
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:42,940
They have a fancy for a classic kind of comet. Give us Katamari to write home about, please.

213
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:52,360
After the Rugrats. Yeah, there is a Rugrats vibe from that music.

214
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:13,579
Hold on. I need to hear it. Rugrats bop music. Rugrats. What are they called?

215
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:27,670
Rugrats weird music. Rugrats theme. No, no, no, no, no. It's, it's like, it's not just the theme.

216
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:36,920
The theme doesn't do it. No, that's not, that happens during episodes when they're walking

217
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:49,940
around. What you're referring to is that like happens way more often like this in the episodes.

218
00:45:50,579 --> 00:46:03,210
Like Tommy will get up and start walking and it'll be like bop bop bop bop bop bop bop. Here we go.

219
00:46:04,789 --> 00:46:17,260
And we need that chocolate.

220
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:30,940
I know I'm going slow, but sometimes you have to. I gotta get all the chocolates.

221
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,550
Got the tops and I can move back this way. Let's clear this whole rack. What do you say?

222
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:55,800
Am I already big enough to pick this up?

223
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:07,610
These things? Yep. I got a decent amount of time too.

224
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:24,409
Cookie dough. I can't feel like this is just gonna get to the grocery store.

225
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:31,980
He's like, I want that. I give me that too. I want that. I want all that. Let's get four cookie doughs.

226
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:37,369
We don't really, I think we need one cookie dough. No, we should get four.

227
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:47,860
Why? Because we're gonna, we'll make like, we'll make like 80 cookies.

228
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:55,909
I did the same shit when I ordered pizza. How many of you guys have ever ordered pizza before?

229
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,590
And you're sitting there going, all right, pizza. Anybody want pizza? No, I don't want one.

230
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,309
Do you want any pizza? You other person that's here? No. Okay, well I'm going to get two large

231
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:13,179
pizzas and eat like four or five slices and that's it. And then it goes in the fridge.

232
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:19,769
You can reheat pizza? Yeah, but it's never the same. I know some people love it, but

233
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:30,730
did I miss a present? Was I talking? Cold pizza? Yeah, but the grease like solidifies

234
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:38,739
and it turns into this weird blanket. I mean, I'm not saying I won't heat it up and eat it.

235
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:49,510
I also feel the same way about, for instance, like a steak and cheese sub.

236
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:56,070
It does not matter what the circumstances. I've tried a million times. There's no way.

237
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,429
And I think I brought this up like maybe a week or two ago. Someone brought up like eating and

238
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:05,909
eating one meal a day or whatever. If there's a steak and cheese in front of me, it's going to

239
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:13,940
be gone. I'm not going to have any leftovers. This thing could be like 16 inches long and it's,

240
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,900
I'm going to eat the whole thing. I never have a leftover when I have a

241
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:31,000
hero or like a grinder. Ever. It's never happened. Come on, get up there. Come on,

242
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,889
get the stuff on the top. Come on, look at how much stuff there is up here.

243
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,559
Come on, climb it. Don't look here as you go. I'm going outside.

244
00:49:41,559 --> 00:50:00,469
Didn't you eat a grinder from your car a while back?

245
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:07,369
All right. You're making that sound like I opened up the hood and cooked it on the engine.

246
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:20,309
Technically, no. It was, I bought it and left it in the car and it was a turkey sandwich.

247
00:50:20,869 --> 00:50:26,260
And I, it wasn't very good. I did not eat it.

248
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:36,500
Hey, don't do that. Disgusting. Yes, it was. That's why I didn't want to eat it.

249
00:50:46,139 --> 00:51:00,250
You did it. You're a liar. You're fucking with my image, right?

250
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:28,599
It's been one minute. How big is it going to be? Back in the house. Is it going to be 100?

251
00:51:38,789 --> 00:52:04,389
It's got to be 200. No, it does not. 200. Oh, this ain't happening. I'm going to do it again.

252
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:16,579
Nope. Wasted too much time inside. I messed around too much in the shop. Can someone please

253
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:22,179
explain this to us? Why do we always get our heart broken? What is with Kunihiro? Two little

254
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:27,780
self-esteem too much. We hear that common entitlement. Wait, we get it. It's a slacker

255
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,940
thing. What next? Video store clerk? Screenwriter? Whatever it is, we are not paying for it. Poor

256
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:42,280
Poro stuck with a loser. But if you make it big, we want the swag. This game is fucking crazy.

257
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,420
All right. Let's do it again. Yeah, I didn't, I spent too much time dicking around in the shop.

258
00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:08,199
All right. Uh-huh. Two meters. I'm just going right down. Started me in a different spot.

259
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:28,340
Can't climb over that? I guess I can. Let's go. A wall up against a wall. Get them all. Can I pick

260
00:53:28,340 --> 00:54:05,460
up those things? They're killing me right now. Milk bottles. Can't get a cookie dough. I still

261
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:19,190
can't. Go this way. I gotta get outside ASAP. Get to two meters. That's not gonna happen

262
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:41,289
unless I get the hell out of here. That was a good grab, but not enough. Let's get out there.

263
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:53,289
Wait. Not yet. I know. Stop dicking around the shop. I know. I know. But look at all this.

264
00:54:54,090 --> 00:55:20,179
I don't even need to do that. I can't get the flowers. I can't get that. I can't get that either.

265
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:31,579
I can't get any of this shit. I gotta grow now.

266
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:52,219
There we go. Can I actually pick up these? Oh, this stuff takes so spread out.

267
00:55:52,699 --> 00:56:01,139
Cars.

268
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:20,389
Move, pro. Please. Not stuck in a wall.

269
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:47,699
Get it. Go around the city. Yes. I know, but I want the cake. Ugh. Okay, city, city, city, city, city.

270
00:56:48,659 --> 00:57:12,940
Two meters. I gotta, I got two, three minutes to do it. Faster, faster, faster, faster. I'm trying.

271
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:40,940
I don't wanna go in the water. Okay. Here we go. It's so slow. Move. Ah. I'm not gonna make it.

272
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:52,539
Guess I hit the people. I'm too small. I need to be a little bit, like, even for the kids.

273
00:57:53,179 --> 00:58:05,880
All right, I'm at one meter. This is where, this is where it's steam rolls.

274
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:35,159
All right, big enough for people. Get it. 40 seconds. Come here. 1.5. What am I running into?

275
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:43,909
Consume. I'm not big enough. I'm gonna fail it again, I think. It's gonna be tough. No, it's not.

276
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:53,500
I can steam roll right now. Just go pick up everything. Get all these TVs. 1.8. No! People!

277
00:58:53,500 --> 00:59:14,630
1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8, 1.8. All these kids. Oh. That was close. Off to Princeton.

278
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:28,619
I want Derma to be my sleep paralysis demon. You don't want any sleep paralysis demon.

279
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:45,190
It's scary. Do we get a little Japanese stuff? Two meters. Hey, Japan.

280
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:49,719
Ingredients are Japanese things. Yes, looks like you managed to get it.

281
00:59:50,679 --> 01:00:19,019
What about our big Japanese wish list? I think he just is mean to you every time. That's bad.

282
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:41,190
Comet. All right, Japan unlocked two for 10G. That pasta sucks. I can't even read it.

283
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:53,400
Okay, where to? How about? Do I want to do presents? What about this train?

284
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,000
Hey, look at a new place.

285
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:11,320
Cloud nine forest. Roll up plants to make Jupiter. Let's see it.

286
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:28,070
This is your chance at a majestic Jupiter. King has never been more right in his life.

287
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:36,489
It's all Jupiter's bottoms. Yeah, what's going on here? I've seen like one.

288
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:57,500
This is unbelievable. Can you guys get one? Almost. No. No. Oh, it's not going to happen.

289
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:12,150
Some of you guys have usernames that are way too long that you're pushing them. I've seen some

290
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:26,739
sloppy Jupiters. I've not seen a complete true Jupiter though. Can't do it because of slow mode.

291
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:33,880
That means you have to work together harder. There we go. It pretty much happens. Yeah.

292
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:43,400
All right, we may be the glitziest star in the sky, but this is so yes. Five meters

293
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:51,860
in six minutes. This is a big one. I got to pay attention for this one.

294
01:02:51,860 --> 01:03:10,250
Can I get cheating? Get them all. What are we? Candy corn? We are not speaking to you.

295
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:34,679
What? I don't even know what's happening. Why do you guys get so angry? Look out. Ayaya. Ayaya.

296
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:51,340
Why are we doing ayaya? Get that shit out of here. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

297
01:03:51,340 --> 01:04:10,630
I'm kidding. It was a joke. You can say ayaya if you want. He was serious.

298
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,239
All right, I got to pay attention. I think it was six meters. I'm not even close.

299
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:33,670
The whole, like, rabbit seance.

300
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:56,820
All right, I gotta go. Six meters. That's not gonna happen.

301
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:17,289
All those crabs. Ooh, Ashley. You got the cat? I did.

302
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,110
Ooh.

303
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:37,909
I can't break the glass and get the angel hair pasta with a sprinkle of olive oil and salt?

304
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:55,820
That's right. That's what's in there. Who sung this? I don't know. I think it says it in the beginning.

305
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:07,110
Rewind. This person just destroyed me. I got roped over five times by that same person. All

306
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:21,130
right, three minutes. Get rid of all the radishes. Strawberry plant, actually. Cool.

307
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:30,500
My favorite Ed Sheeran song. That's not even how you say it. Okay.

308
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:50,469
Can I get the bikes? Not yet. Get all the fruit. I think it was inside of this person's restaurant.

309
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:15,659
Two meters. I just ruined somebody's party. Can I get the little frogs? Yep, I can get those now.

310
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:28,380
All right, I need to steamroll this now. Here we go.

311
01:07:38,469 --> 01:07:47,260
Almost in one minute. Banger right. I got the... Is it a clown?

312
01:07:48,219 --> 01:08:14,280
I can get to the roof. I'm going to the roof. Get up there!

313
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:43,270
No! I'm not big enough. I'm not big enough.

314
01:08:45,189 --> 01:09:08,810
Yes, restarted. Oh, four. I need six. Well, can someone please explain this to us?

315
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:14,649
Why do we always get our heart broken? What's with this guy? Too much is titled slacker,

316
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:23,689
loser, idiot, stupid. Is this more or less stressful than Dead Rising?

317
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:40,500
They may as well just be the same game. You're right. I know. More clocks to worry about.

318
01:09:42,470 --> 01:10:04,859
Crap? No. That kind of started me out in a weird spot here. Oh no, here's this song again.

319
01:10:13,529 --> 01:10:34,920
One in chat if you hate this song. Two in chat if you love it. I gotta hurry up. Go!

320
01:10:39,670 --> 01:11:16,840
All right, end. Oh, oh, shit. The bunnies. They keep forever to turn on.

321
01:11:40,409 --> 01:12:02,970
He passed. I passed? What do you mean I passed? What's with those bricks?

322
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:24,970
All right, I gotta pay attention. Good, good, good, good. I got a cousin!

323
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:47,979
I gotta get out of here. Please, just get me out of here. Congratulations.

324
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,510
I'm trying to get the pitch right. I'm stuck in a fucking wall.

325
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:32,420
All right, I have... Oh, this is hard. All the shocks. All right, get all these in a row.

326
01:13:37,319 --> 01:14:06,970
Better than last time. Let me in, let me in, let me in. Oh, come on, I'm mostly free!

327
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:31,640
Turn around. Up. No, no, no! Oh, I'm so... In the water. I'm so fucking angry right now.

328
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:55,619
We're gonna lose again. We're gonna lose again. How do I get to the fucking city center?

329
01:14:56,579 --> 01:15:13,829
I lose. This again. There's not enough time. I feel like I need like extra time. What? It's like

330
01:15:13,829 --> 01:16:07,829
too long. It's possible. Hold on. It's possible. Fucking giraffe. Stop. I don't care. I have to

331
01:16:07,829 --> 01:17:00,659
get out of this world. Old face to itch. Oh, all right. Just go outside already. I'm not going to

332
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:52,699
sing it again. If there's anyone that's curious. Move out of my fucking way. Those trophies.

333
01:17:53,739 --> 01:18:23,689
Watching you do this actually aggravates me. You literally go pick up the smallest stuff where you,

334
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:27,529
German, NA5. Watching you do this actually aggravates me. You literally go pick up the

335
01:18:27,529 --> 01:18:31,210
smallest stuff to where you could be getting larger. Try harder, German, the Cosmos, Daddy,

336
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:48,170
plus Spanky. Good thing I read that whole thing. Stop distracting me! All right, I'm distracted.

337
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:59,909
That's not good. All right, it's already, you've already fucked it all up. Oh, you've fucked it

338
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:15,189
all up already. There's lots of gold back there. All right, out. Two centimeters. I need to get,

339
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:31,750
just not much more. I've got three minutes. Get out of there. All the stuff with the water.

340
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:49,539
I'm going up.

341
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:18,010
Yes, I know. All right, three minutes. Two minutes. Bye. All right, now I gotta go up here.

342
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:46,439
What do I keep hitting? The umbrellas? Fuck off. You're gonna make me mad. Watch out for the

343
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:54,310
umbrellas. I swear. I thought that was a breakdown for the song. I was about to start singing.

344
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:36,550
Go! Get up. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog. Pog to the chat. Pog to the chat. Pog to the chat.

345
01:21:49,750 --> 01:22:07,109
Down the road. Pick up everybody. Every car. Every truck. Ducks. Might as well. Q.

346
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:52,279
Oh yeah. Game's pretty sick. You guys are so mean. Let me do this. Daddy's gonna be mad at you.

347
01:22:53,159 --> 01:23:08,409
I want to hear this song again. I can't. I'm not gonna do it. Plants, flowers, aquarium. That's

348
01:23:08,409 --> 01:23:23,140
what you wanted. There are hardly any plants in here. It's all of them. But there is a present

349
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:37,640
accessory. A little flower. Never good enough daddy. All right, that's enough. That's enough.

350
01:23:38,199 --> 01:24:24,329
Spaghetti, aglio e olio. It's the essence of Italy. In case anyone was wondering.

351
01:24:25,689 --> 01:24:47,100
Oh, fuck. Oh, my chest. Okay, that hurt. Okay.

352
01:24:49,340 --> 01:25:00,619
Were you here like an hour ago? Oh, fire. Looks like fireman.

353
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:21,529
Welcome to the red hot roller coaster. Out of this crystal will rise the new planet Mars.

354
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:29,930
You can guess what you need. Hot, hot, hot stuff. Heaters. Kotatsu. Campfires. Cork buns.

355
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:33,930
The red planet should be piping hot. Freshly baked. Be warm. Be generous. And roll a big

356
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:56,939
Katamari up. This thing's probably going to be like 10 meters. We've come to roll in this store.

357
01:25:56,939 --> 01:26:03,180
Kind of hot. Yes. Ew. Someone remind us why exactly we're here. Oh, yes. Katamari. We need

358
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:07,979
a nice hot Katamari. For that, you need to roll up the piping hot stuff.

359
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:13,300
We'll time you until the Katamari is 10,000 degrees Celsius.

360
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:20,100
What? It's not about size. Cold things will lower your temperature.

361
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:40,970
All right. Sausage. Bowl of soup. This one is the Katamari song with dogs and cats. All right,

362
01:26:41,050 --> 01:27:03,100
this is all hot. We'll get the sodas. Baby milk. Why is baby milk so hot? I mean, maybe warm. Oh,

363
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:16,630
shit. I think 10,000 degrees. Hot soup. Oh, slow down. Hot buns. Hot coffee.

364
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:30,840
Hot tea. I can't see what the hell I'm getting. Okay. Bags of hot. I don't even know what they are.

365
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:41,020
Salmon. Does it hold? There's like steak dinner and shit over there. Something warm. It's miso.

366
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:55,260
We asked you to go feed the star ponies. The king is hungry. Every day. Let's go outside.

367
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:16,649
What's with the screen? Is it a roast pig? No, that's cold. Of course, they put the pig right here

368
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:40,520
next to all the freezer shit. Pizzas, cheeses, pizzas. Watch out. Is it dervishes? Yep.

369
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:56,260
Pairns. Fire extinguisher. Don't touch. Let me get the pig now. Forget about the pig.

370
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:21,500
Those are sodas. Don't go in the water. What are you thinking? Don't go in the fucking water.

371
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:47,590
5,000. Halfway there. What that is. This shit is absolutely real fire coming out. All right,

372
01:29:47,590 --> 01:30:06,729
present. Slow down. That's ice cream. Don't touch it. Is that snowmen? This

373
01:30:06,729 --> 01:30:20,460
sheep in the background is fucking with my head. Pick up the flames. All right, 10,000.

374
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:36,390
Nobody can listen to that. All right, I'm gonna go across the water just for a second.

375
01:30:54,470 --> 01:31:00,439
I'm gonna pick up. Shit, it's so hard to see what I'm picking up. I just dropped.

376
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:21,460
Dropping fucking viewers, man. Dropping viewers like crazy. Dude, turkeys and shit. Oh, look at

377
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:34,569
this. It's done. It's over. 9,000 degrees. 97, 98, 99. Viewers increasing. Oh, shit. Viewers

378
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:59,380
decreasing. I won. I won. Imagine a viewer count was that volatile. I mean, maybe if it was

379
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:16,890
ants or something. The amount of ants that tuned in. He sees this as ants. No, I'm talking about

380
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:23,880
like just ants. I don't know, man. I have to stop laughing at my fucking side.

381
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:32,970
You don't just roll, Mars. You broil and braise it.

382
01:32:33,689 --> 01:33:02,460
It's big from far away. Let's see. Food, cooking drinks. Lollipop. Nice. And a new, is it just the

383
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:25,590
same person I am with clothes on? 57 is not a passing grade. That's enough. Anything under 60

384
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:35,590
is a failing grade. Unless they've changed schools in the last 20 years, which they may have.

385
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:56,810
Have they? I'm gonna save. Should I get the lollipop? No, I don't want to get on the fucking train.

386
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:10,699
Get out of here. Oh, it's just in my mouth. That's sort of strange.

387
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:42,859
Under 65 unless it's a purge. What? No way. Anything new down here? DLC. What is dentist in my mouth?

388
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:55,989
Oh, I miss someone. Maybe to the right.

389
01:35:05,609 --> 01:35:09,130
Go, go, go, go. Yes, there is.

390
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:27,579
Seadome. This is to make Neptune. The Tide Palace. Roll with distinction and the cosmos gets a new

391
01:35:27,579 --> 01:35:33,500
Neptune. What you need are things from the big blue sea. Yachts, boats, fishies, maelstroms.

392
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:38,779
Neptune should be briny and wild and free. Yes, make a big catamaran and surf with the tribe.

393
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:47,319
For classes in your discipline you need to have usually 80 or higher or in an equal of credits to

394
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:52,279
offset a grade under 70. You usually can do that for like eight credits. What have they done to

395
01:35:52,279 --> 01:36:13,739
our schools? What have they done to us? I don't know. Whoever is in charge. What do they do? In

396
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:23,590
my college everybody would, there would be no grades. There'd be no attendance record and there'd

397
01:36:23,590 --> 01:36:32,970
be no grading. Everybody gets a B. People just show up and there's zero students in class.

398
01:36:33,689 --> 01:36:51,939
All right, how big is it after 25 meters? No, but once a week I would have like a weird like

399
01:36:51,939 --> 01:37:00,819
minute to win a contest for grading. I'm just describing. There's like a TV show on ABC that

400
01:37:00,819 --> 01:37:05,619
is that right now. It's AP Bio with Glenn Howard. Yeah, like that's like what I'm describing.

401
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:22,489
Oh my god. It's a TV show. The guy that, Dennis from Always Sunny. Do I have to explain this or

402
01:37:22,489 --> 01:37:36,420
am I about to get livid that you guys don't know who that is? This thing's gonna be huge.

403
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:51,989
Watches TV. Oh megalal. Well you don't think you watch TV? That's interesting. Everybody

404
01:37:51,989 --> 01:37:57,029
has said they do not watch TV. I can get you with a got you right now. Would you like to hear it?

405
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:11,270
Where do you consume the Olympics? You know, the Olympics.

406
01:38:15,989 --> 01:38:21,880
That's the Star Wars theme, but it's it's almost exactly the same.

407
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:39,560
The Olympics theme is almost the exact same as that Star Wars song. See, I just had to think

408
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:53,350
about it for a second. It's just the same song for a long time. The Olympics app is free.

409
01:39:02,279 --> 01:39:23,819
They have like a table subscription. Here's about sports. I don't know. We'll see. It's

410
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:34,920
gonna be interesting because the the younger crowd, with me included, I'm the one. We're

411
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,640
not watching as much sports I don't think as our older relatives are.

412
01:39:49,020 --> 01:40:15,939
Am I making this up? No, I don't think I am. Having like sports attendance

413
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:24,229
like the last five years or something. I can't be making this up. There's no way this is wrong.

414
01:40:24,789 --> 01:40:45,800
My sources, there's just some drunk guy at a bar one time. NFL viewership is rising. Okay, I've

415
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:59,899
been hit by every car that came down the road. Am I going to be clear about that? I'm just gonna

416
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:17,750
get some houses here. You only put one in the road. If you hit one more car, I'm gonna leave.

417
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:36,229
Does it count if I crush it? That's what happened. Oh, look at this.

418
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:55,979
Almost there. That last one was so much harder. The islands. Go to the circus.

419
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:21,880
Pick it up. No, this is where it gets crazy here. All the cars. Yep. Out of the way.

420
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:38,779
Something round. You got Marnie. Yes. Am I big enough for the boats? We'll find out.

421
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:50,300
Not quite the boats, but big ducks. These ducks are huge.

422
01:42:51,100 --> 01:43:03,510
And yes, they're boats. I know. Oh, almost. One more and I can pick up all the buildings.

423
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:20,949
13. I don't want 13.

424
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:47,670
Biggest one yet. The RVs up there. You can't get up there. I can get some of the houses.

425
01:43:47,670 --> 01:44:48,470
Not all of them. I go back around. Come on and get the dog. It's stuck and over. But wait,

426
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:53,100
there's more over there. Stop picking up small things. Don't pick up small things. Stop, stop,

427
01:44:53,100 --> 01:45:14,340
stop, stop, stop. You want to know how I read that coffee pasta? Watching you do this is so

428
01:45:15,060 --> 01:45:24,279
aggravating. You continue to pick up small items and it's not. What's the king doing?

429
01:45:26,899 --> 01:45:48,649
Resignation? Put that silly ball down and come over here. Oh, I failed? What did I need? It was 25.

430
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:58,489
I thought it was, oh, I thought it was 20. That's why. I was picking up the small items.

431
01:45:59,449 --> 01:46:19,880
It was 25? Oh, that's not good. Well, I thought it was 20. Shit. I would have taken that a lot more

432
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:27,300
seriously. Damn it. Eight minutes. All right. No fucking around. Let's go.

433
01:46:41,619 --> 01:46:50,229
Anyone notice this? I really like when Jerma like starts to understand like he has to really try

434
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:55,829
and go get through to the game. I always think it's so like inspiring when he just like starts

435
01:46:55,829 --> 01:47:06,729
to do so well because he knows he has to win. First comment. Me too. I love that when he really

436
01:47:06,729 --> 01:47:10,329
needs to get to the end of that. I actually have beaten Dead Rising 2 a bunch of times

437
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:17,140
and I can't believe he didn't restart. He played through just one and done. That's pretty,

438
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:25,000
that's pretty remarkable, if I would say so. New thread. Anyone just fucking loves him?

439
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:43,590
Okay, that's a wide, I thought he was like, is that a urinal? What is he riding?

440
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:55,100
All right. Okay. Let's put the image of him pissing himself.

441
01:47:55,579 --> 01:48:08,970
Fuck. Bad timing here. I'm just doing so poorly.

442
01:48:35,979 --> 01:49:00,630
Hello? Over here. I can't pick him up. Now I gotta actually really pay attention.

443
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,680
Now that I can get pretty much all this stuff in one time.

444
01:49:07,399 --> 01:49:12,090
Greasy. Not there yet.

445
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:31,109
Holy moly. What? What happened? I gotta turn?

446
01:49:31,989 --> 01:49:51,449
Let's get all the people sitting over here and then I'm gonna go over the ledge.

447
01:49:52,729 --> 01:50:05,590
What am I listening to? That's pretty big Katamari. I know, I just said Katamari. I know.

448
01:50:08,579 --> 01:51:01,460
Stay here. No. Now I gotta really string it together. Every road. Every car.

449
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:13,100
Traffic right here. I gotta go one more up. Up one more. Up one more. Oh, maybe do it again.

450
01:51:14,729 --> 01:51:32,680
25, right? All this shit over here. Yes.

451
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:47,909
We're turning around. We're going back the same way. Ready? Buses. Can I not get the buses?

452
01:51:48,789 --> 01:51:49,979
No, not yet.

453
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:22,949
That's really possible, actually. It's very possible.

454
01:52:44,859 --> 01:53:02,520
Freeze. Help. I don't have to leave here.

455
01:53:03,479 --> 01:53:32,439
18. Come on. Give me the big ones. Give me the big red ones. I'm stuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

456
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:38,329
Give me the whales. I got them all.

457
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:02,810
There's a lot of concentrated shit over here.

458
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:20,329
No, not choking. No choke this time. That's for another time.

459
01:54:20,489 --> 01:54:59,800
Move steady. Oh, save. Jerma, you're huge. I don't know. Ocean. Plants. Yay.

460
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:19,029
I would love to see King of Cosmos and Smash Brothers. That'd be pretty great, actually.

461
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:39,720
He's too big. He's too big. Too big. That's the, that's the Ridley argument. Yay for a star.

462
01:55:44,470 --> 01:56:22,060
Neptune. He's planet size. Something of a stage. There's a rainbow. Oh, it goes nowhere. What's the next level?

463
01:56:25,659 --> 01:56:38,699
Egg school. I see one. I see two, actually. Interesting. Cool house. Maybe I have to go here.

464
01:56:39,420 --> 01:57:27,560
Well, this one is just like the hot one is the cold one. Pluto. Honey, there are lots of cold, cold things like snow, ice, icebergs, fridges, and a cold Pluto for what we need to cool off. A wet washcloth planet, a dark room of a star. Anywho, slip, shy, can, can. Look at all those Xbox controllers. Oh, this place again.

465
01:57:28,819 --> 01:57:55,060
Kunihiro. Remember this place. Yes, we have been here many times before. That's right. It's the money dimension. We understand that money can't buy everything, but it's nice to have a lot. Yes. So, anywho. One meter in three minutes. That seems hard.

466
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:16,489
One of the best controllers ever made. Picking it up right now. Can I get the ice creams that are on the...

467
01:58:17,369 --> 01:58:24,789
What's going on? Hey, give me those. You dick. What?

468
01:58:34,539 --> 01:58:41,020
Look at all these Xboxes. Oh, so this is where they keep all the ones at red rank.

469
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:48,069
I mean, that's an average household amount of Xboxes that you had to send back.

470
01:58:48,069 --> 01:59:42,250
Alright. No, here's the sponsoring stage. I get to roll up cool things. The Xbox. That's really cool, huh? Can I get the Xboxes? Not yet.

471
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:54,310
I'm going to have to punch into this, because... I'm going to get to one meter. Here. Kunihiro.

472
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:40,920
Xbox, for death. Got an Xbox. I got multiple Xboxes. Did it! Lost. I got to get most of these.

473
02:00:42,039 --> 02:01:06,100
Should I go back to the red ring room? It's too late. The Xbox 360. I mean, the hardware was dog shit.

474
02:01:07,619 --> 02:01:24,760
But it was a good console. You must be freezing from rolling all the icy bits.

475
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:44,170
And I just got the Xboxes. It was cold? Weird. I wonder what I would actually say is the worst console

476
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:52,890
of the last three generations to count this one. You know, so like Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox.

477
02:01:53,850 --> 02:02:10,149
It's probably the Wii U. Yeah. The Wii U was terrible. It's funny because

478
02:02:11,029 --> 02:02:19,420
immediately after that, they have one of the best consoles they've ever made. The Switch is awesome.

479
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:40,470
Saturn. I don't even know the Ouya. The Ouya does not even count.

480
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:56,390
I don't. It doesn't. No, that's not. I think you only count as a console in a generation

481
02:02:56,390 --> 02:03:05,500
if more than 200 people owned you. Because I could probably make a box that played like one shitty

482
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:23,689
game and it would probably have more people that owned it than the Ouya. I remember seeing them on

483
02:03:23,689 --> 02:03:29,529
shelves and it was like dust was on top of them because none of them had been taken. You could

484
02:03:29,529 --> 02:03:43,420
run your finger across the top of the 25 they had stacked. This is a stylish city. Lots of

485
02:03:43,420 --> 02:03:49,779
pretty people here. Lots to see and do. This Katamari has a special rule. Go collect lots of

486
02:03:49,779 --> 02:03:59,050
ring-shaped stuff. You have this much time to collect lots of rings. Bicycle wheels, car wheels.

487
02:04:03,939 --> 02:04:11,220
Okay. How many do I need? It's not about size, but don't be tiny.

488
02:04:25,350 --> 02:04:45,159
Are you mad at me? Pires, skateboards, before rings.

489
02:04:49,210 --> 02:04:59,260
Power place. You guys like this one? Donut, score. Oh, it's Van Van.

490
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:15,260
We asked you to put the cozy on. Oh, that's a new character. I like that one. Get the bike.

491
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:30,500
Get people around. Cars. Yes.

492
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:56,250
I'm vibing with this one. How does that pick up all those people?

493
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:12,220
That counts. Dropping carts. What does that mean? Vibing. I see it all the time. At least day

494
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:33,079
of the day. Fun fact, this track is written by Avril Lavigne. What are these strange things and

495
02:06:33,079 --> 02:07:10,039
why? You know what I want to do? Does the thing exist to keep your vocabulary up? You know those

496
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:19,510
things? Brain games. Brain age. Is there one where I can do vocabulary? I need to have my

497
02:07:19,670 --> 02:07:32,470
vocabulary checked out. I'm talking about a little game I can play in bed. It has to be a game I can

498
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:48,340
play on my iPad or I refuse to download. No, no, no. Not a book. I don't want a story. I want a game

499
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:57,699
that I can play that gives me a word. For instance, let's say the word is fast and it has like five

500
02:07:57,699 --> 02:08:01,699
other words that mean fast and you have to say which one is the right one and it tells you if

501
02:08:01,699 --> 02:08:17,350
you're correct. Were it a crossword? No, no, a crossword is a thesaurus. A thesaurus game.

502
02:08:18,149 --> 02:08:50,460
How do we gamify this? I need a thousand rings or I'm going to quit live streaming.

503
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:55,340
I'll go on camera and I'll say, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last one.

504
02:08:55,340 --> 02:09:36,920
Thanks for everything. We're all the rings. We're just a bunch of like dead animals.

505
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:51,659
Like, no, no. Okay. I got to do this. These circles? These aren't rings.

506
02:09:57,159 --> 02:10:07,539
Guys, guys, this is bad. How will anybody ever trust a single thing I say ever again?

507
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:32,500
I know his career is over. His career is over. His career is actually over.

508
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:45,670
What did I say? 800? Hold on. Hold on. What did I say? 800?

509
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:38,470
It's okay. Within five. If you're within five, that means you did it.

510
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:42,810
If you're within five miles per hour for the speed limit, you know, if you give the speed

511
02:11:42,810 --> 02:12:03,479
limits 30 and you go like 31 or 28, 32, you're fine. You rounded up. Guys, I say that like,

512
02:12:04,119 --> 02:12:10,199
I say that like five times a month. No, I don't. Not that much. I say that like three times a year.

513
02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:22,170
I say that a lot. I believe in you from the beginning. Hey, it's been really good.

514
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:32,899
You've done that four times this stream. You know, you're right. I can't keep getting away

515
02:12:32,899 --> 02:12:45,430
with that. How could I ever trust him again? I know. Seriously, you can't trust me anymore.

516
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:58,899
I'm definitely going to be the donut person. Make a montage of every time I've lied. I've actually

517
02:12:58,899 --> 02:13:06,520
asked for that. That would take a long time though. Not because I lie all the time, but because

518
02:13:07,159 --> 02:13:10,680
just think about the amount of time you need to go through and find every time that I lied

519
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:17,159
in at least the last five years. That's probably hundreds of times.

520
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:38,390
This is not possible. The video would be hours long. Oh, I would just, that video would be so

521
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:42,470
long that I would have to just play that video and mute my microphone and just sit there silently.

522
02:13:43,829 --> 02:13:55,619
All right, I want to be the donut. Come here. All right, I'm going to be Ban Ban.

523
02:13:56,579 --> 02:14:01,909
And I want to try the new clothes. With the camera on, yep. Just shaking my head.

524
02:14:03,909 --> 02:14:19,699
Is the game audio too loud? I'm sorry. Yep, the horn and a backpack.

525
02:14:27,289 --> 02:14:34,810
All right, we'll do, we'll do one more and we'll finish it up tomorrow.

526
02:14:35,609 --> 02:14:46,140
See, we're on this trend the last couple streams of beating a game, getting halfway through another

527
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:50,140
one and you need to start at the next stream, beating that game, starting something else.

528
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:15,029
Always half a game behind, yeah. Is there a new one? I don't see anything new. Did I miss one?

529
02:15:16,149 --> 02:15:22,170
When am I going to do NGU Idol? You're going to have to fight through a sea of people

530
02:15:23,130 --> 02:15:26,090
who will do anything it takes to not see that on stream again.

531
02:15:27,050 --> 02:15:33,100
So I don't have, I, what am I going to do about that? Roll up energy to make the sun.

532
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:55,060
Actually, this is a good one to stop on, I think. Dinaville. No, I can't do NGU anymore.

533
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:07,020
The game is cool. I love those little games like that. They're not stressful. They're just,

534
02:16:07,739 --> 02:16:18,569
they're just there. Oh, also, I know that the feature sucks and it's a stupid shitty feature

535
02:16:18,569 --> 02:16:26,329
right now, but I was thinking about just putting on a random TV show to watch with the Amazon

536
02:16:26,329 --> 02:16:41,209
watch party when it comes out. Those of you that don't know, you can't talk and I just have to

537
02:16:41,209 --> 02:16:51,670
type in chat. This thing, it has to be huge, by the way. That's enormous. I have 10 minutes to do

538
02:16:51,670 --> 02:17:02,180
this. Why don't I do my own Amazon watch party where I go get royalty-free old movies and we

539
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:07,370
just watch one. Stuff that's just in public domain. That doesn't even matter.

540
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:23,100
Can you do that? Can I just watch like a shitty public domain movie from like the 30s?

541
02:17:30,780 --> 02:17:34,139
That would either be a really funny fun stream or a terrible stream.

542
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:46,180
We both. Maybe we'll try it. What do you guys, all right, what do you guys,

543
02:17:49,299 --> 02:17:55,299
the problem is, here's my problem. You gotta commit to that because if halfway, if like,

544
02:17:55,459 --> 02:18:00,899
after like 20 minutes of that movie, I'm just like, I, this sucks. I don't want to do this anymore.

545
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:24,329
You can't, I can't leave. What am I gonna pause, cut the movie off after like 45 minutes? If it

546
02:18:24,329 --> 02:18:38,969
sucks, just play Fortnite on your phone or something. Something about watching a kind of

547
02:18:38,969 --> 02:18:46,659
current TV show though, it actually might be kind of fun to just sit in chat and just be one of you,

548
02:18:46,659 --> 02:19:01,500
you know what I mean? Just experience it with you guys. We'll have to see. How does it work?

549
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:10,709
I don't think I even have access to it. It's like a beta right now, right?

550
02:19:19,770 --> 02:19:32,149
Just recreate a public domain movie. That would take a lot of work. Can we do that right now? I

551
02:19:32,149 --> 02:19:36,709
don't think I have access to it. Like a beta right now. I could probably request access to it.

552
02:19:38,149 --> 02:19:42,659
But I would, I really wish I could at least talk over the movie.

553
02:19:45,819 --> 02:19:52,469
I, okay, I understand that. I understand that that, oh, it's like a thing with copyright and

554
02:19:52,469 --> 02:19:58,700
they don't want to have like the movie be shown or replicated again with it. What, what, how,

555
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:05,030
why does that matter? You guys ever watched a movie with your mother? My mother talks over every movie.

556
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:16,629
Why is that bad? What, I think people don't talk during movies? When you go to the movie

557
02:20:16,629 --> 02:20:20,549
in the movie theater, there's somebody talking. They're like having a full-on conversation.

558
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:30,010
What's the difference? I mean, the face cam thing, maybe. All right. Okay. So because you're,

559
02:20:30,649 --> 02:20:33,690
you're like not in the movie. You're not, you're not supposed to be part of the movie.

560
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:38,010
It's licensed out. It's the movie. You're not in it, but just talking.

561
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:56,870
You can't even talk over the movie. No, from my understanding, you cannot talk.

562
02:20:58,149 --> 02:21:15,799
Like there's no microphone and you can't be on camera and ever whoever is viewing needs

563
02:21:15,799 --> 02:21:26,969
to have Amazon Prime. Yeah, that's true. Broadcast the show to your channel or the movie. I mean,

564
02:21:26,969 --> 02:21:30,170
that, that isn't that the quickest way for me to get like my channels suspended.

565
02:21:31,450 --> 02:22:00,379
Now what do we need? Like 500 meters. Can I get houses yet? I get it. If they ban you,

566
02:22:00,379 --> 02:22:16,659
just ban them back. Uh, that didn't work. All right. I only have like four more minutes to do this.

567
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:36,600
I'm not going up there yet. Let me get all this shit first. You're going to get banned

568
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:47,379
and then imagine that. Oh, why'd you get banned? Uh, well, I streamed the nutty professor

569
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:52,340
to my chat and we hung out and watched it and now I can't stream ever again.

570
02:22:58,899 --> 02:23:14,440
That's too bad. It was fun though. All right, we're getting there straight ahead. Super fast

571
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:28,040
motion. Hit the plane. Copyrights only last 75 years. Yeah. Ain't Mickey Mouse going to be

572
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:39,100
up for a copyright soon. That's going to be really, really crazy. Imagine your local car

573
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:45,290
dealership having Mickey Mouse in the commercial and the guy that owns the dealership is doing

574
02:23:45,290 --> 02:23:56,139
the voice. You're going to have to deal with that. Oh, come on down to Paul's, Paul's uh,

575
02:23:56,139 --> 02:24:01,979
employee of all of land vehicles. Oh yes, it's me, Mickey Mouse. Come on down and just save

576
02:24:01,979 --> 02:24:11,959
20% on the neck on your first purchase. That's going to be horrendous. Oh, welcome to Michael's

577
02:24:11,959 --> 02:24:17,000
furniture store. Oh, it's me, Mickey Mouse. Thanks for joining us and I have you come in

578
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:36,379
by a sectional. You guys ready for that? I don't think you are. Oh jeez Rick. And some of them

579
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:41,290
aren't even going to give a shit. They're not even going to try. Mickey Mouse will be on screen

580
02:24:42,170 --> 02:25:03,959
animated. That's right. With two purchases, you get the third one for free. Tell them Bob sent you.

581
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:31,079
All right. I need to, I need to get to 500 meters. I'm going to lose. It's going to be a

582
02:25:31,079 --> 02:25:38,649
15 second pause. There might be. This is some cool shit though. Too bad we're never, too bad

583
02:25:38,649 --> 02:25:55,850
we're not going to be able to see very much of it. It's still kind of possible. Maelstrom.

584
02:25:56,489 --> 02:26:07,829
Not big enough for the maelstrom. What the fuck is going on in my chest?

585
02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:53,270
Come on. I spent too much time talking about Mickey Mouse. 230, 220, 230. Halfway there.

586
02:26:54,969 --> 02:27:18,420
I fucking lost. I swear. Didn't even make it halfway. Yeah. How the fuck did I do that?

587
02:27:19,059 --> 02:27:26,440
This is Matthew from the other streaming platform team. We're reaching out to you for a rat pack.

588
02:27:27,159 --> 02:27:35,450
We're reaching out to your rat pack. We're fans. I can't even read this. We're prepared to offer you

589
02:27:35,450 --> 02:27:47,379
$5,000 a sleeve full of Oreos in a backpack. Free present. Am I not big enough to get this?

590
02:27:48,659 --> 02:27:54,739
This is terrible. Bad RNG. What a bad place to start.

591
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:05,420
Backpack. Imagine changing platforms for a backpack.

592
02:28:06,139 --> 02:28:28,840
I'll tell you, that thing better be made out of gold. Imagine selling backpacks.

593
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:46,899
What a bad idea. Did you guys buy a backpack? No, by the way, there's $79.99. Dude is right.

594
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:09,780
Sell a briefcase? Dude, you know what I would, you know what I should sell? Fucking not. Hey,

595
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:32,549
luggage. Everybody needs luggage. Yes, other cities. I know.

596
02:29:33,430 --> 02:29:41,110
Let's go get the stuff that I didn't get over here. We're out. Which way is it? Straight left?

597
02:29:43,510 --> 02:30:04,809
Like a lug? Yeah, like just like luggage. Luggage. Suitcase. Stuck. Where the hell am I going? I gotta

598
02:30:04,809 --> 02:30:16,899
go this way. You don't get it. Just suitcase. You know what you can take on an airplane or on a bus?

599
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:58,010
Nice spot where I can probably do this.

600
02:31:07,430 --> 02:31:23,579
Why is he not talking? I mean, I am. I'm just trying to focus. I think I have to get

601
02:31:23,579 --> 02:31:26,459
500 beaters in seven and a half minutes. Six and a half minutes.

602
02:31:26,620 --> 02:31:46,250
I'm still not big enough to get these. Mike is not muted.

603
02:32:09,559 --> 02:32:22,680
Don't be cool. My girlfriend is watching. I got you. Does anybody know when, um, I think

604
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:29,860
as long as I go up this, I can't fake a voice crack. So I'm fucking cool, man. So I'm gonna tell you.

605
02:32:49,690 --> 02:33:01,899
All right. 48, five minutes remain. Holy, holy, a present.

606
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:51,479
Okay. Better spot than I was the last time. Let's go get this city. Okay. Now where?

607
02:33:56,969 --> 02:34:16,809
Really? I can't get any of those? What? 100. All right. Start picking up everything.

608
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:22,299
You listen carefully. You can hear him scream. Or you can hear the dust scream.

609
02:34:23,819 --> 02:35:05,030
What was that? Am I big enough to start picking up islands? I'll be there in a second.

610
02:35:05,829 --> 02:35:58,440
All right. Islands. To the mountain. Oh, this way. Dinosaurs. Here. 250. I'm fucking close.

611
02:35:59,879 --> 02:36:13,610
Okay. What are you doing?

612
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:19,860
Maybe at 300. This will stop to. All right. Now the islands.

613
02:36:20,979 --> 02:36:39,690
I can start picking up most things now. Just move. Flag. It's so hard to turn it. I can't even

614
02:36:39,690 --> 02:37:13,829
control it. Oh, no. I don't want to be this way. Why would you move? I'm just moving. Get to a

615
02:37:13,829 --> 02:37:25,559
thousand. Get the giant dragon. Dragon. No. If I don't get to a thousand, I will quit screaming.

616
02:37:26,600 --> 02:38:12,010
Here's your new thousand. Career saved yet again. C-A-R-E-O-M-E-G-A-L-L. No, there's no O.

617
02:38:12,729 --> 02:38:24,360
It's not career or. You want fries with that? Career. I'm kidding. I know how to spell career.

618
02:38:25,079 --> 02:38:59,139
I'm not like from the fourth grade. Energy. Present. Pancakes. Sandwiches. Another cousin.

619
02:38:59,139 --> 02:39:31,340
Another cousin. Peso. The sun. That's a new one, though, for a lot of people is,

620
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:44,139
are you pretending to be bad for a documentary? Cool. All right. I think it's a good time to call

621
02:39:44,139 --> 02:39:54,840
it. Just under the seven hour mark. We will. I'll ride the train. We'll see you tomorrow.

622
02:39:56,489 --> 02:40:02,739
I'll finish this tomorrow. We'll do the DLC levels and then, I don't know,

623
02:40:02,739 --> 02:40:20,899
fucking mystery stream. We'll find out tomorrow. The Nutty Professor. We're not going to be watching

624
02:40:20,899 --> 02:40:33,340
The Nutty Professor, unfortunately. Thanks for coming out, guys. See you tomorrow. Let us go

625
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:43,110
to bits and hopefully the sub credits thing is fixed. It was screwed up before. Remember the

626
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:47,139
credits from last time? They just didn't get pulled through. Maybe they fixed it. We'll find

627
02:40:47,139 --> 02:41:28,549
out. Let's go over here. Might as well check it. It was worth a check. Dermavurb noun. Immortalized

628
02:41:28,549 --> 02:41:40,360
in the bits and the insane gifted subs. Yeah, pretty much. But special thanks to Dark Soul.

629
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:48,180
Thanks to the 250, they say. I hope you're getting to the bottom of your doctor stuff and feel top

630
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:53,299
soon. You haven't even said your famous catchphrase. Have a Jerma 985 day in a while.

631
02:41:53,940 --> 02:42:04,739
Get well soon. Yeah, I'm going to have, I'm going to know, I think, what's going on soon here. It's

632
02:42:04,739 --> 02:42:12,379
been a real pain in the ass, but, you know, do what you got to do. We'll see. But thank you,

633
02:42:12,379 --> 02:42:17,399
Dark Soul. Appreciate that. For real, though, thanks to the 250, Jerma, have you ever considered

634
02:42:17,399 --> 02:42:22,200
to do a one-off stream of a Paradox game like Stellaris? I know they can be hard to fully

635
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:30,790
grasp, but I think they'd be some good RP and bit opportunities. Probably not. Games like that,

636
02:42:31,430 --> 02:42:36,149
they sort of, they require, correct me if I'm wrong, don't they require a pretty large time

637
02:42:36,149 --> 02:42:42,709
commitment before you can really get into the game and care about it? And you all know me when it

638
02:42:42,709 --> 02:42:54,440
comes to reading. I get distracted and I lose interest really quickly with stuff like that.

639
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:10,899
Not just on stream, just in general, too. No books. I'm more of a run zombie over with car.

640
02:43:12,389 --> 02:43:31,260
Kind of guy, you know? He's our illiterate streamer. That was a pretty good time rumor. Yeah.

641
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:39,129
But no, probably not. The last time I played, I mean, I don't, Mountain Blade is one of those

642
02:43:39,129 --> 02:43:42,329
games that you have to kind of sit down and actually care about and play and learn and

643
02:43:42,329 --> 02:43:48,360
there's a learning curve to it. And that kind of didn't turn out. That was all right. It was fun

644
02:43:49,000 --> 02:44:00,729
for a while. It gets good $500 in. I'm sure it is. Just not really for me.

645
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:12,180
But thanks. Thank you, Doc, for the, whoa, almost just read one under the threshold. That's my bad.

646
02:44:12,819 --> 02:44:20,709
If you don't know, we have, there's a threshold on the channel. Anything above 250 bits

647
02:44:22,120 --> 02:44:34,889
is the ones that are read. And I fucked it up right there. I'm going to let this one slide,

648
02:44:34,889 --> 02:44:45,610
though. This is from we ran or why ran. Thanks for the 249 bits. But hold on. I'm a dummy and

649
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:56,920
I used one bit to talk in sub mode chat. So that's okay. Whatever. That's like funny to me. So I'm

650
02:44:56,920 --> 02:45:03,959
going to read this. Anyways, any plans of playing the MCC halo games or any other rhythm games?

651
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:16,549
I have Buster group. That's kind of waiting in the wings for some random day. But halo,

652
02:45:18,389 --> 02:45:26,360
we're going to have to, we will enjoy the halo games together. I have never played a halo game.

653
02:45:27,079 --> 02:45:33,299
I have only played halo to multiplayer, just sitting in a room with some friends.

654
02:45:34,100 --> 02:45:38,260
I have never played halo ones campaign, never played halo to never played halo. I don't,

655
02:45:38,260 --> 02:45:50,540
I've never played them. So I have the string of that series. Whenever I feel like doing it,

656
02:45:51,260 --> 02:46:04,620
we'll see. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you. MGS fan for the $30 3000 bits. No message.

657
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:17,350
There's a lot of money. Thank you. MGS fan. Appreciate it. Hydra. Thanks for the 500 bits.

658
02:46:17,909 --> 02:46:37,209
Please watch Joel's 3d movie maker movie. No link. You don't have a link here. How long is it?

659
02:46:37,930 --> 02:47:01,270
It's 26 minutes long. There's a full episode of TV. We're going to set like a whole day to

660
02:47:01,270 --> 02:47:08,870
watch this one. It's like 30 minutes. Well, there's your TV show. Maybe we'll watch that.

661
02:47:09,860 --> 02:47:17,989
Not right now. I thought you many made like a little bar that I have to check. I wonder how

662
02:47:17,989 --> 02:47:27,049
those are you that will anybody watch? Anybody watch his 3d movie maker streams? Did he have

663
02:47:27,049 --> 02:47:41,370
fun playing in a 800 by 600 window in the middle of his desktop? It took him 60 hours to make it.

664
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:50,600
Yeah, my game takes time. Halfway through his files. Yeah, you have to mod it. Otherwise,

665
02:47:50,600 --> 02:48:00,040
it's unbearable. I'm not even sure you can play it without the new tools. It's been a long time

666
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:05,370
since I've really gone in there and played with it. Talk about 3d movie maker.

667
02:48:08,409 --> 02:48:25,450
Well, maybe we'll watch it one day. We'll have to watch it in chunks. It's legendary. Yeah,

668
02:48:25,450 --> 02:48:32,600
rat movie two took like three weeks to make. And it was like nine minutes. There's like at least

669
02:48:32,600 --> 02:48:37,000
two or three weeks to like it sit down and do it for a few hours didn't to get away from it. Sit

670
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,239
down for like three, four hours to long fucking time. That program is not meant to make stuff

671
02:48:41,239 --> 02:48:53,979
like that. So I can imagine a 30 minute short movie. It had it had to have taken like months

672
02:48:54,780 --> 02:49:04,440
of actually sitting down and like sitting working on it. But that's really cool.

673
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:11,139
I knew that they were I knew he was he was doing it. I know he was doing 3d movie maker at one

674
02:49:11,139 --> 02:49:19,819
point. But I'm glad other people know that that exists and use it. Because it's a untapped gold

675
02:49:19,899 --> 02:49:30,379
mine. It's good to see people playing with it. But that was from that was the

676
02:49:32,229 --> 02:49:37,750
that was just a chat. That wasn't even a bit message. No, it was it was Hydra. Hydra 500

677
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:44,299
bits. Thank you Hydra 725. Dino pulse thanks for the 500 bits. Just the thought I'd ask what's

678
02:49:44,299 --> 02:49:50,600
your experience been with Street Fighter accidentally putting 50 cents into the machine in the arcade

679
02:49:51,799 --> 02:50:00,950
losing so badly that I've never played ever again. I don't I don't do fighting games.

680
02:50:03,659 --> 02:50:11,159
You know when I just get really angry when a zombie grabs me in Dead Rising. That's the feeling

681
02:50:11,159 --> 02:50:17,000
that I feel every time somebody gets a combo off on me. It's like God fucking damn it. No,

682
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:32,540
stupid. No games fucking not even that happens every match. Stupid fucking idiot fucking down

683
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:41,379
fucking idiot. Those games can be kind of fun. When you just have a few drinks and you just act

684
02:50:41,379 --> 02:50:45,829
like a dickhead with some of your friends. But you always end up with the one friend that actually

685
02:50:45,829 --> 02:50:54,389
knows how to do everything. And nobody wants to play against them. Because you gotta you gotta

686
02:50:54,389 --> 02:51:00,579
room for four or five people. Four of you have no idea what you're doing. You've learned one move

687
02:51:00,579 --> 02:51:06,659
and trying one small combo. And this this other this other dude can do like a 40 hit combo with

688
02:51:06,659 --> 02:51:17,420
smoke. By the way I'm talking about me. That was me. Mortal Kombat 3. I decimated with smoke.

689
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:33,610
Cyborg smoke. That's the one. I love being the guy that knows the stuff. That's actually kind of fun

690
02:51:33,610 --> 02:51:37,340
because you can tell everybody what to do. And then they look at their controller and they look

691
02:51:37,340 --> 02:51:41,579
at their hands. And they slowly do the move you just told them to do. And they did it so wrong

692
02:51:42,139 --> 02:51:47,739
that you're just mad in the chat. Because the streamer didn't go the way that you told them to.

693
02:51:47,739 --> 02:51:50,940
And you just can't believe that they would miss the thing that they missed.

694
02:51:51,659 --> 02:51:54,950
And then you do you watch as they crumble.

695
02:52:04,090 --> 02:52:07,690
We struck a nerve. I'm sorry what were we talking about Street Fighter?

696
02:52:10,010 --> 02:52:21,780
I respect those games but I can't play them. You played you played Divekick. Yeah but that's

697
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:32,659
it was just me and Star just dicking around. I respect them I can't play them. They're fun to

698
02:52:32,659 --> 02:52:38,969
watch. VictionIshius thanks for the 300 bits. After this can you do a Simpsons hit and run

699
02:52:38,969 --> 02:52:46,629
speed run? I would probably never play that game again. It's in the vault. I've closed the door.

700
02:52:48,309 --> 02:52:55,610
I put Simpsons hit and run in the bank vault. I closed it spun the thing and then when it said

701
02:52:55,610 --> 02:53:00,969
please create a password I just smushed my fucking hand all over the keypad. I don't even know what

702
02:53:00,969 --> 02:53:16,620
the password is. Don't ever let me open that door. But thank you for the 300 bits. Hole of one zombie

703
02:53:16,620 --> 02:53:20,940
thanks for the 500 bits. I think you mentioned some of your comedy influences before or perhaps

704
02:53:20,940 --> 02:53:25,659
it was a voice actor. Did growing up in Boston shape that at all? From what I heard there was

705
02:53:25,659 --> 02:53:31,020
a large stand-up comedy scene back in the day. Also what's up with Providence? Why if I ever

706
02:53:31,020 --> 02:53:35,819
watch a film set in Boston is there a scene where some guy's brother coming down from Providence?

707
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:40,780
Like it's Mickey he's coming down from Providence. Maybe I'm just a lunatic thanks for the streams.

708
02:53:42,139 --> 02:53:53,190
Because Providence is in Rhode Island and it's really close. It's just a state away. It's just

709
02:53:53,190 --> 02:53:58,440
like another state for them to say you know you know when you go and watch a movie and they say

710
02:53:58,440 --> 02:54:06,340
the name of your city it's for that's why. And you sit in the chair and you're like oh and you look

711
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:10,020
back up back to the people that are with you and you're like that's they said the name of the city

712
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:16,840
that we live in. Did you hear you guys heard that all of us heard that. Cool cool they said the name

713
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:30,629
of a town. I guys I do that now even with Vegas. Anytime I oh yeah yo uh give him a call yeah he's

714
02:54:30,629 --> 02:54:43,030
down in Vegas. Oh I that's me that's where I live. I just watched the hangover movie and I'm

715
02:54:43,030 --> 02:54:50,100
constantly going oh fuck I know what that is. Hold on where's that camera pin I yep yep I've been

716
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:59,000
there I've been there I stood there. Cool oh you guys see this I do it with my city yeah everybody

717
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:08,139
does. I don't know why I guess it's just cool to see it in like 35 millimeter film. It's all digital

718
02:55:08,139 --> 02:55:25,340
now. German lied about 35 millimeter being films. It's still cool though. But um I'm not sure if

719
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:31,579
being around Boston is what shaped. I just watched a lot of cartoons and a lot of tv.

720
02:55:32,620 --> 02:55:43,739
I was just a huge fan of just weird cartoons. I was a huge Jim Carrey fan. They're just animated

721
02:55:43,739 --> 02:55:54,700
fun interesting people. But with the weird cartoons running stimpy pretty much anything on

722
02:55:54,700 --> 02:56:06,459
Nickelodeon from 1992 to 1996. Thoughts on Jim Carrey in the Sonic movie? Um I don't I don't know

723
02:56:06,459 --> 02:56:13,500
I've just seen like the trailer. He's getting older too. You know you see he's like he's something

724
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:22,709
he's like almost what he's 60. He's old. He's getting older. Yeah he's pretty old. Let's see

725
02:56:22,709 --> 02:56:40,469
how old is Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey is he's 57. I mean he's still doing what he's still able to do

726
02:56:40,469 --> 02:56:52,489
right. But yeah I just a lot of Saturday morning cartoon stuff. A lot of Nicktoon stuff. There are

727
02:56:52,489 --> 02:56:58,440
others that I could definitely think of that have just shaped the way that I think things are funny

728
02:56:58,440 --> 02:57:04,219
or interesting. There's probably I could probably go rifle off a bunch if I sat here and thought

729
02:57:04,219 --> 02:57:19,159
about it. But yeah there you go. Thanks for the message. Thank you uh Lights Noton for the 250.

730
02:57:19,159 --> 02:57:24,280
Hey Jerma love the Dead Rising streams. I really commend you on the all-in-one-go approach. Keep up

731
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:31,180
the great work. You're a treasure. Turn cam on. Turn the streams over. Turn cam on. Don't work.

732
02:57:31,739 --> 02:57:36,700
Yeah I told you I get I get the the the Boy Scout badge that says I did it in one go.

733
02:57:37,879 --> 02:57:42,120
You may have restarted. I didn't. I get that the stapler comes over and just

734
02:57:42,680 --> 02:57:53,030
onto my chest. It says you did Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 true endings in one go without

735
02:57:53,030 --> 02:58:00,840
restarting the game. And it hurts a lot. And then I turned it and you're sitting there behind me.

736
02:58:00,840 --> 02:58:04,120
You're about to get your badge but your badge is not that. I turned you and I just go

737
02:58:04,680 --> 02:58:09,459
I stick my tongue out. Quick enough where the adults don't see me do it.

738
02:58:11,190 --> 02:58:34,549
And I turn back. Oh yeah thank you. There's that Nicktoons influence. Dexter's lab. Yeah that was

739
02:58:34,549 --> 02:58:41,590
the same kind of era. Early 2000s, late 90s. I know it's so easy to be like ooh 90s.

740
02:58:41,750 --> 02:58:47,979
I'm a 90s kid. Oh 90s. But there were some really great great

741
02:58:48,780 --> 02:59:02,219
cartoons and pieces of media and actors and comedians. It was awesome. So many incredible

742
02:59:02,219 --> 02:59:12,549
shows and and were just airing during that period. I know everybody looks fondly down

743
02:59:12,549 --> 02:59:16,549
on when they grew up when they were a kid and everything and I don't know some of you guys that

744
02:59:16,549 --> 02:59:22,309
might be a decade younger than me right now in this chat probably have those same fond memories

745
02:59:22,950 --> 02:59:31,079
of something. I'm trying to think of something that was like Minecraft. Think about that for

746
02:59:31,079 --> 02:59:38,860
a second right. Imagine if you imagine if you were like 12, 13, 14 when Minecraft released.

747
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:47,719
Dad it's kind of a that's a huge thing. That was a really really cool thing. If you were younger

748
02:59:49,159 --> 02:59:54,280
imagine 10 years go by and you look back on everything that's me talking about running

749
02:59:54,280 --> 03:00:13,219
Stimpy. So everybody looks fondly back on the cool shit that they had. I was in my 20s in my

750
03:00:13,219 --> 03:00:20,979
late 20s and I thought that Minecraft was one of that first alpha. I remember specifically saying

751
03:00:20,979 --> 03:00:29,780
holy shit if I was a kid right now if I was 10, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old

752
03:00:33,159 --> 03:00:38,520
that would have been with me. This multiplayer you can build your own communities and houses and go

753
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:44,229
on adventures with your friends. I cannot even possibly imagine what it was like for some of

754
03:00:44,229 --> 03:00:54,709
you guys to be able to do that when it came out and you tried to cash in with grandpa.

755
03:00:55,270 --> 03:01:06,120
I used to carry a copy of Minecraft on a USB stick so I could play it at school.

756
03:01:07,340 --> 03:01:14,819
That's so ridiculous. But then you think about what's the what's the new thing? What's everybody

757
03:01:14,819 --> 03:01:21,930
going to get into now? If you look back fondly on how awesome Minecraft was for the years that

758
03:01:21,930 --> 03:01:30,180
you played it when you were a kid. What is that now? Is it Fortnite? Is it? I don't think it is.

759
03:01:30,180 --> 03:01:45,190
You know why? Because Fortnite is a battle royale game. Fortnite is not Minecraft. It's really,

760
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:51,020
really popular. But if the Fortnite if Fortnite is the Minecraft for the kids right now

761
03:01:51,579 --> 03:02:04,090
and is the Ren and Stimpy for me. I don't I'm not so sure I like that. It's just a BR is not

762
03:02:08,969 --> 03:02:15,530
need to wait a few more years. I wonder what the next big thing will be. Once BRs are done and gone

763
03:02:15,530 --> 03:02:22,860
it was mobis for a little while. What's it gonna be next? Maybe the next iteration of VR

764
03:02:23,579 --> 03:02:32,149
might actually do it. Because imagine you picking up a VR headset that's like a Vive 3 or whatever

765
03:02:32,149 --> 03:02:37,350
the hell it would be. And you put it on you're like holy shit this is insane. This is this is

766
03:02:37,350 --> 03:02:42,149
way better than the original vibe. This is like genre defining. And there's like a 12 to 13 year

767
03:02:42,149 --> 03:02:54,360
old that's putting it on for the first time. We'll see. Just wait for Minecraft 2. Didn't

768
03:02:54,360 --> 03:03:00,329
it already come out? It's Minecraft in real life right? I actually was gonna download it. I couldn't

769
03:03:00,329 --> 03:03:12,860
all of my devices aren't good enough. I tried. Yeah Minecraft Earth. My iPad's not good enough

770
03:03:12,860 --> 03:03:18,139
and my iPhone. They're both not good enough to run the game. I can't even download it. It

771
03:03:18,139 --> 03:03:33,370
won't let me. I was a little disappointed. Yeah I have an iPhone 6. I want. You ready for me to

772
03:03:33,370 --> 03:03:38,409
explode right now? Have I ever talked about this? It's the end of the stream. Who cares?

773
03:03:39,129 --> 03:03:49,620
Have I talked about the iPhone SE? You ever heard me go off on that before? I don't think so. No.

774
03:03:49,620 --> 03:04:03,879
This is fresh. Why is the only phone that's not a gigantic brick not only discontinued

775
03:04:03,959 --> 03:04:12,420
but they're never gonna make one ever again. That iPhone 4 case, the iPhone SE was this iPhone

776
03:04:12,420 --> 03:04:20,409
special edition. It was small. It was that iPhone 4 chassis. Small enough to fit in your hand.

777
03:04:20,409 --> 03:04:29,270
Easy to go in your pocket. And they deleted them. They discontinued the SE. Why? And apparently the

778
03:04:29,270 --> 03:04:37,340
rumors that the SE 2 is gonna be as big as a regular iPhone. Nobody make, they're all huge.

779
03:04:37,340 --> 03:04:45,079
Nobody makes a phone anymore that's a 4 to 6 inch screen. That iPhone 4 size, everyone's just

780
03:04:45,079 --> 03:04:55,270
making huge ass phones. Nobody, nobody is making a fucking phone that is a, I'm gonna say it,

781
03:04:55,909 --> 03:05:05,159
but you know, I'm gonna say it. Compact. It's compact phone. I don't want a huge phone. I want

782
03:05:05,159 --> 03:05:11,190
a small phone that I can easily get in my pocket and get out and put, I don't like this big phones.

783
03:05:11,190 --> 03:05:18,299
And the SE was perfect. I am not kidding. Kim can literally corroborate this story.

784
03:05:18,299 --> 03:05:28,500
I was going to get an SE and they discontinued it two days before I went in to go buy one.

785
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:34,059
We actually went into the iPhone store. I was like, oh, let's get an SE. Oh, we don't have those

786
03:05:34,059 --> 03:05:40,040
anymore. And it was because I was like, I got on stage once every fucking seven months and goes,

787
03:05:40,040 --> 03:05:47,260
hey, we're putting out new phones now that are all 1500 bucks each. And we're deleting

788
03:05:47,260 --> 03:05:59,299
the last generation. Why do they have to delete, what is this, Hearthstone? Why do I have to go

789
03:05:59,299 --> 03:06:08,969
back like two generations and delete them? Well, that's not in our standard decks anymore. The

790
03:06:08,969 --> 03:06:12,250
SE was so different that I don't know why they didn't keep them around and everybody loves them.

791
03:06:12,250 --> 03:06:18,409
It's not like I'm some weirdo that's making a big stink about the SE. If you type in like SE,

792
03:06:18,489 --> 03:06:27,379
new SE, please God new, you get threads. People fucking want it so bad, but no, please scan my

793
03:06:27,379 --> 03:06:37,420
face with the fucking 17 inch screen on my phone. I want my camera to be as good as like a film

794
03:06:37,420 --> 03:06:46,969
camera. I don't give a shit. I want to be able to take my phone out of my pocket and it's so huge

795
03:06:46,969 --> 03:06:51,610
and heavy and it makes a loud noise and I drop it on my desk. So everybody has to hear it and look

796
03:06:51,610 --> 03:07:07,399
over here and they see my cool case. If you could kill somebody with your phone, it's too big. Just

797
03:07:07,399 --> 03:07:18,440
saying. I don't know why they don't make him anymore. And I looked up other companies too.

798
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:26,139
There's a, uh, there's the, the, the, the razor, right? The Motorola, Motorola razor,

799
03:07:26,139 --> 03:07:30,840
but there's a new razor coming out. It's a, it folds. It's a foldable phone. Well, that's really

800
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:35,559
cool. What's his, what is, what, what did you say? What did you say about that? You said that it was,

801
03:07:35,559 --> 03:07:52,819
it was more than 15, $1,600 for that phone. Oh, okay. The iPhone SE was like 300 bucks.

802
03:07:54,500 --> 03:08:14,010
I don't want a like $1,700 phone, but it folds. Is that worth 1,500 bucks? Sooner or later,

803
03:08:14,010 --> 03:08:16,809
they're going to, you're going to have to start financing your phone like a car.

804
03:08:20,170 --> 03:08:25,530
Now I got, yeah, I got a great interest rate on my phone. How much was it? It was 8,100 bucks,

805
03:08:26,090 --> 03:08:32,090
but I found financing it over 40 years. Yeah. I have a 12% annual interest rate on it. It's,

806
03:08:32,090 --> 03:08:35,450
it's pretty good. Pretty good. It would have been 15. Good thing my credit's so good.

807
03:08:36,170 --> 03:08:51,659
I just want a goddamn telephone that can text and can play Minecraft Earth. You could buy a

808
03:08:51,659 --> 03:09:01,620
trash phone to say, but I don't want a trash phone. I don't want a trash phone. I want a small

809
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:09,909
screen that has like apps, like small, doesn't have a big process, a long battery. I don't want

810
03:09:09,909 --> 03:09:17,979
to go into Walmart and buy the $39 like poo poo wireless, whatever the hell the things are,

811
03:09:20,540 --> 03:09:27,100
like prepaid, like $30 phone that is made. It's like a toy. It's like a baby phone.

812
03:09:27,100 --> 03:09:38,120
I know it sucks even worse. Rip the whole, rip the covers off this conversation.

813
03:09:39,059 --> 03:09:47,450
Rip the covers off. You know that they still make the SE, but it's for prepaid phones. So if you

814
03:09:47,450 --> 03:09:55,399
want a SE, you got to go to get one of these prepaid fucking poo poo wireless phones and you

815
03:09:55,399 --> 03:10:03,799
can't unlock them. They don't, you can't use them on another carrier. Just give me the phone and

816
03:10:03,799 --> 03:10:17,540
just unlock it. Stop doing my best buys filing for bankruptcy. Well, give me my phone and maybe

817
03:10:17,540 --> 03:10:30,219
we'll see. But like I'm going to help them. And then it has to be off of the right carrier.

818
03:10:30,219 --> 03:10:34,379
Well, that, if you, that would, if you unlock that one, well, hold on a second here. That one only

819
03:10:34,379 --> 03:10:43,340
works on the, uh, the Verizon and AT&T networks. That's not going to work on T-Mobile. Why? Uh,

820
03:10:43,340 --> 03:10:52,969
because this is the way that I don't know. I can't tell you either, sir. And then you got the people

821
03:10:52,969 --> 03:11:01,350
that bought a bunch of SEs. They went to, I just wanted to, I just wanted an SE. They went to the

822
03:11:01,350 --> 03:11:07,510
Apple store when they heard about the discontinuation and they bought 10 of them and they keep them in

823
03:11:07,510 --> 03:11:16,629
the seal. And then they sell them for like 500, 600 bucks, 700 bucks. It's sealed. I just want the

824
03:11:16,629 --> 03:11:26,059
SE. It should be one per customer in the store. But then they buy them all. I don't even, where

825
03:11:26,059 --> 03:11:32,760
do they even get these? Okay. Welcome to the, welcome to Apple store. How can I help you, sir?

826
03:11:32,760 --> 03:11:49,319
I'd like to buy 15 iPhone SEs. Sure. Right this way. The 200 bucks new on eBay. That's a lie.

827
03:11:50,040 --> 03:11:55,420
Those, those have like tracking devices in them. The person opened it up and like put a bunch of

828
03:11:55,420 --> 03:12:05,319
viruses on them and they closed it back up. You wouldn't complain if they were buying 15 of your

829
03:12:05,319 --> 03:12:29,850
shirts. You don't need my shirt to make a phone call. And my shirts also aren't $300. My carrier

830
03:12:29,850 --> 03:12:35,510
is glue. All right, let's get out of here. Just so you know, where the fuck is the SE2? If the SE2

831
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:46,260
comes out and it's not a compact phone, I will leave Apple. Oh, wait, I don't care. I don't give

832
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:55,209
a shit what phone I have. I know that's like a way to pull. I'm going to take that seriously.

833
03:12:55,770 --> 03:13:04,329
Jeremy, your phone is a tracking device. Yeah, I know my phone is a tracking device, but it's not,

834
03:13:04,329 --> 03:13:28,360
it doesn't have a direct bug to like Larry's apartment. The guy that put it on there. It's

835
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:31,399
constantly recording. How do you think voice activation works? I don't have any of that stuff

836
03:13:31,399 --> 03:13:54,920
turned on. Siri off, tracking off. They don't know where I am. All right. I just,

837
03:13:55,879 --> 03:14:03,700
I'm just thinking of somebody turning off Siri and then being like, all right,

838
03:14:03,700 --> 03:14:24,979
now I can go to Pornhub. Siri's off. It's the greatest surveillance device that the police

839
03:14:24,979 --> 03:14:38,969
state could have wished for. Not if you turn off Siri. Don't you have to actively go into

840
03:14:38,969 --> 03:14:42,090
like Windows 10? I remember doing this when I first go Windows 10. Don't you have to go into

841
03:14:42,090 --> 03:15:04,889
Windows 10's settings and just click like, like, please leave me the fuck alone. It's crazy

842
03:15:04,889 --> 03:15:11,780
because as much as this is a joke, I don't like being in a room that has an Alexa in it.

843
03:15:11,780 --> 03:15:17,180
It's almost like I want to talk in a different room. It's like, Hey man, what'd you do yesterday?

844
03:15:17,180 --> 03:15:23,770
Well, you know what? Well, you have an Alexa. I mean, nothing I say is going to be bad.

845
03:15:24,329 --> 03:15:27,559
You're like, can we go, like, can we go in the other room? Like I just come up here,

846
03:15:27,559 --> 03:15:44,250
like when I whisper into your ear, you should choose your words more carefully.

847
03:15:44,250 --> 03:15:49,370
That's the freaks me out. I don't like Alexa. I don't like Siri. I don't like the Google

848
03:15:49,370 --> 03:16:01,290
Assistant. I don't like them. I don't want them. I don't want them. I'll tell you the convenience

849
03:16:01,290 --> 03:16:12,809
factor for being like, Hey, Alexa. Yes. Order 10 more cases of ocean spray pineapple juice.

850
03:16:13,860 --> 03:16:22,809
Okay. It'll be here tomorrow. Thank you. But I don't, I don't like them. They freak me out.

851
03:16:27,559 --> 03:16:37,700
Stop, Jerma. You just ordered that. Why are you scared to talk around Alexa when you tell us so

852
03:16:37,700 --> 03:16:42,659
much about, too much about your life on stream anyways? Yeah. But that's me choosing to tell you

853
03:16:43,479 --> 03:16:48,360
if I shit my pants, like I did three days ago and I was in my bed and I was like,

854
03:16:48,360 --> 03:17:05,979
I just shit my pants. I don't want Alexa to know that. I tell my Alexa everything you tell me.

855
03:17:11,079 --> 03:17:18,780
Anybody playing telephone? Oh, I shit my pants yesterday. Hey, Alexa. Yes, Roger.

856
03:17:18,780 --> 03:17:20,219
Jerma shit his pants yesterday.

857
03:17:24,379 --> 03:17:40,649
What is it? I don't get it. All right, we gotta get through this. No, it's different. When I like,

858
03:17:40,649 --> 03:17:45,690
when I'm in a conversation with somebody, here's the difference. I am broadcasting to you right

859
03:17:45,690 --> 03:17:52,950
now. I'm choosing to broadcast to you. If I go to dinner with Kim, that I'm not broadcasting the

860
03:17:52,950 --> 03:17:59,340
dinner to you guys. I'm not broadcasting the dinner to my mother. If I'm sitting at the dinner table

861
03:17:59,340 --> 03:18:04,899
and we're having a dinner conversation, that's not me doing a live stream. That's me and Kim

862
03:18:04,899 --> 03:18:16,360
eating dinner. I don't want Alexa to just fucking lean in and listen to me. But why not? I don't want

863
03:18:16,360 --> 03:18:23,350
somebody just like listening to me. If somebody opened my front door while I was eating dinner

864
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:28,760
and just sat in a chair and just that's what they did. They just sat there. Hey, who the fuck are

865
03:18:28,760 --> 03:18:37,739
you? My name is Alex. Oh, hi, Alex. Can I help you? No, I'm just listening to everything you say.

866
03:18:40,329 --> 03:18:46,170
Okay. And like Kim comes home from work and we just start to, you know, I don't want to have Kim,

867
03:18:46,170 --> 03:18:51,379
can we go another? This guy is sitting in the corner and he just has his hand put up cupped

868
03:18:51,379 --> 03:19:09,239
around his ear leaning forward. That's freaking me out. Can we go upstairs and talk? He hates Joel's

869
03:19:09,239 --> 03:19:15,850
movie. What? He's writing everything down. That's what I'm saying. I don't want anyone just to

870
03:19:15,850 --> 03:19:20,809
listen to me. People have like private conversations. I don't want like some random

871
03:19:20,809 --> 03:19:28,250
Alexa sitting there hounding me. And you can always tell because if you talk too loud around one of

872
03:19:28,250 --> 03:19:32,729
those things or if you like you're in the middle... Okay, let's say I was talking to the doctor. I'm

873
03:19:32,729 --> 03:19:38,389
on the phone with the doctor and we're going over some very sensitive information. Yeah, okay,

874
03:19:38,389 --> 03:19:42,469
that sounds good. So we're going to come in next week. I'll come in next week. We'll do that other

875
03:19:42,469 --> 03:19:45,989
test. Yeah, thanks for all the information. Thanks for all my medical records that we just talked

876
03:19:45,989 --> 03:19:55,959
about over the phone. Next week, adding to your calendar. What the fuck did you just do? No, no,

877
03:19:55,959 --> 03:20:04,020
what? Or, or... I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say? I wasn't talking to you. I'm

878
03:20:04,020 --> 03:20:18,809
plugging it from the wall. I'm not having one. Joke's on you. We're all Alexa. All right, how

879
03:20:18,809 --> 03:20:31,319
do we even get on Alexa? I don't know. I'm going to tell Google Home you're scared of them. Sooner

880
03:20:31,319 --> 03:20:42,149
or later, there's gonna be a service in the dystopian future where it is a it is a phone

881
03:20:42,149 --> 03:20:50,010
booth that is padded and you go in and it's called the monologue box and it's just a spot for you to

882
03:20:50,010 --> 03:20:57,000
go in and talk without anybody fucking being able to hear you. You go in there and vent,

883
03:20:57,000 --> 03:21:06,969
but then it comes out that the boxes were bugged and they were being sold to Facebook and that's

884
03:21:06,969 --> 03:21:16,500
how you're getting your targeted ads. Monologue box. That's my bathroom. Thank you. Thank you.

885
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:24,790
Thank you. Thank you. You're right. Thank you. I go off on full like theatrical monologues in front

886
03:21:24,790 --> 03:21:35,780
of my bathroom mirror or the shower. It sucks when you get caught doing that though. Well,

887
03:21:35,780 --> 03:21:43,459
this happened recently. A week ago, I was I was on like a full-on just like just like theatrical

888
03:21:43,459 --> 03:21:51,559
monologue just talking into the mirror in like a towel and I and Kim walked in the room and when

889
03:21:51,559 --> 03:21:59,209
you have that scenario with you're just monologuing somebody comes in the room you have you you have

890
03:21:59,209 --> 03:22:08,180
that one second panic ability where you either pretend you were talking to them pretend you were

891
03:22:08,180 --> 03:22:18,040
singing a song or pretend that you are on the phone pick one and it better be quick. I didn't

892
03:22:18,120 --> 03:22:24,819
have it. I just simply said you caught me just monologuing. Yeah, I got nothing and she's laughing

893
03:22:24,819 --> 03:22:31,139
so that I was she says like that you're a weirdo or pretend it just didn't know you can't pretend

894
03:22:31,139 --> 03:22:46,659
it didn't happen. I'm a talker though. I will tell you I am a monologuer. I even like go over like

895
03:22:46,659 --> 03:22:54,819
just just scenarios into the mirror that aren't even real. I have to constantly be in communication.

896
03:22:54,819 --> 03:22:59,299
Why do they got live live streaming so much? I just love just being in constant stream of

897
03:22:59,299 --> 03:23:08,920
conscious communication even when it's with a fake person that's just me in the mirror.

898
03:23:08,920 --> 03:23:14,860
Also fun tip if you if you want to get even weirder before you monologue into a mirror

899
03:23:14,860 --> 03:23:19,290
lean forward put your fingernail up and make sure that your fingernails aren't touching

900
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:23,209
because if they're touching that's a two-way mirror and you're monologuing to somebody behind

901
03:23:23,209 --> 03:23:45,129
there. Fun tip that's not true it is if you put your fingernail up to a mirror and your fingernails

902
03:23:45,129 --> 03:23:56,790
are touching each other touching no space in between it is a two-way mirror. Why do I know

903
03:23:56,790 --> 03:24:04,299
that? Because I don't know it wasn't like a book of fun facts. I don't know where I don't know.

904
03:24:04,299 --> 03:24:12,149
I don't know it wasn't like a book I read. It was a book I read called avoiding the government.

905
03:24:12,149 --> 03:24:27,219
It was from a reddit post probably. I don't know where do you do you guys remember every small

906
03:24:27,219 --> 03:24:32,549
little random tidbit of information you've ever been told in your life? You just you just know

907
03:24:33,270 --> 03:24:49,430
never monologue when there's a bird on your windowsill. That's a government surveillance drone.

908
03:24:49,430 --> 03:24:54,569
Birds are government surveillance drones now? That actually wouldn't surprise me.

909
03:24:58,069 --> 03:25:04,649
Birds are weird. Maybe they're just constantly just bugged out. It's just old technology that

910
03:25:04,649 --> 03:25:21,690
we don't even know about. Birds are not real. Birds are dinosaurs. Speaking of dinosaurs I

911
03:25:21,690 --> 03:25:33,260
can't wait to get my monitor lizard. I'm not getting a monitor they're huge they're too big.

912
03:25:35,100 --> 03:25:41,690
I can't no I can't. Although I have been doing a lot of research and it does seem like

913
03:25:42,250 --> 03:25:48,409
for a large lizard the the Argentine tegu is probably the best large lizard you could get

914
03:25:48,409 --> 03:25:58,420
in regards to how social and and just chill they are. If you're in the market for a very large

915
03:25:58,420 --> 03:26:07,719
lizard. What do you guys don't think what do you guys think I do when I lie in bed? I've watched

916
03:26:09,079 --> 03:26:19,940
like probably 50 reptile related videos just I'm looking at snakes and shit but I don't

917
03:26:19,940 --> 03:26:30,020
I don't want a snake. They're cool but I don't think I could do it. Clint's reptiles that's yeah

918
03:26:30,020 --> 03:26:51,799
yep I've seen some Clint's reptiles videos. I'm cultured. I'm gonna do it one day one day soon.

919
03:26:54,540 --> 03:27:02,389
I don't think I'm gonna get like a tegu. I'd probably get something small.

920
03:27:02,389 --> 03:27:08,149
I would never I would want to make sure I was prepared for that. What if your reptile doesn't

921
03:27:08,149 --> 03:27:14,700
vibe with Otto? Then they just they would be separated. They're not gonna be together.

922
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:27,350
Anyways we got a little bit more to go. Let's go. Thank you to where are we? Crispin3day thanks for

923
03:27:27,350 --> 03:27:39,000
the 400 bits. Jerma lied about not streaming for two months. Thank you daddy. How do you still have

924
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:46,309
this username? This this feels like a username that would get automatically declined when you

925
03:27:46,309 --> 03:27:59,690
make your warcraft character. How is this still here? Uh thanks for the 1500 bits. Dad they say

928
03:28:21,899 --> 03:28:37,159
Super epic that's talking about dead rising. We've got a video here. We have a video of ducks.

929
03:28:38,040 --> 03:28:46,170
This is from anonymous. Thanks for the 500 bits anonymous. Hey it's the animal rescue guy here.

930
03:28:46,170 --> 03:28:49,129
The duck you named and the duck italics named had some babies.

931
03:28:50,010 --> 03:28:53,770
Here's a short 30 second video of it. Feel free to share it with chat if you want.

932
03:28:55,079 --> 03:29:10,299
Oh yeah let's take a look. Baby ducks. Let's see. Uh they say also go back to

933
03:29:10,299 --> 03:29:14,459
Resident Evil 2. It was top in your discord poll of games people want you to revisit.

934
03:29:15,180 --> 03:29:24,360
What do the Claire storyline? Let me get this on screen. How am I going to get this on screen?

935
03:29:24,360 --> 03:29:36,180
Well we're going to move to here because we're almost done. Oh that's how. Okay can I get this

936
03:29:36,180 --> 03:29:51,190
on here? Let's go browser source. Nah fuck I have to do it in chrome. That's why I forgot.

937
03:29:53,270 --> 03:30:12,500
I have to do it in chromegalelome. Actually no I don't. Uh what the fuck is going on?

938
03:30:19,340 --> 03:30:30,360
Can you guys see this? I hate computers. You know I like toasted marshmallow jelly beans.

939
03:30:31,079 --> 03:30:36,309
Why can't this be more like a toasted marshmallow jelly bean? You know what I mean?

940
03:30:36,309 --> 03:31:02,659
Can just open please. Open. Is it this? Let me try this. Oh finally. It only took you like three

941
03:31:02,659 --> 03:31:17,610
years. It only took you three years. There we go. All right let's watch a baby duck hatch. What are

942
03:31:17,610 --> 03:31:26,120
you gonna say? Oh here we go. Oh my god that's what's happening right now. Oh there we go. It

943
03:31:26,120 --> 03:31:47,610
just got its fold job. Yeah. There we go. Hi. I did it. He's trying to keep his head up.

944
03:31:48,329 --> 03:31:57,129
The miracle of life. This is just like Jurassic Park. Did that fit you? Oh here we go. Oh my god

945
03:31:57,209 --> 03:32:05,319
that's what's happening right now. Oh there we go. It just got its fold job. Wow. That was awesome.

946
03:32:06,329 --> 03:32:14,729
Cool duck. Duck's name. The duck's name. What's the doctor's name from um

947
03:32:15,690 --> 03:32:21,049
Jurassic Park? Doctor what? Doctor starts with an H. Come on give it to me. I need it. That's the name

948
03:32:21,049 --> 03:32:27,319
of the duck. No not Dr. Schmikeson. It starts with an H. Uh the doctor from Jurassic Park. Dr. Ham.

949
03:32:27,319 --> 03:32:37,700
What's it called? Not Dr. Henry. Dr. Hammond. There you go. That duck's name is Hammond. Hammond?

950
03:32:37,700 --> 03:32:43,559
Little baby Hammond. Took you guys a long time to tell me that. You guys are usually quick.

951
03:32:45,620 --> 03:32:57,219
Hammond's the old guy. Yep sounds good. All right good. Yeah little Hammond. That's good

952
03:32:57,219 --> 03:33:10,790
shit though. Thanks for sharing that. Hey Kai. Thank you Kai for the 500 bits. A few months late

953
03:33:12,010 --> 03:33:16,170
but still glad the birthday card brightened your birthday. It was incredible to see the pages

954
03:33:16,170 --> 03:33:22,659
filled with art and messages from discord, reddit and chat in a week. It was insane. But I agree

955
03:33:22,659 --> 03:33:26,899
with your thoughts on birthdays. Becomes a number in another day. Spent yesterday just hanging out

956
03:33:26,899 --> 03:33:31,239
with friends and family but cheers to being 28. Hoping to continue drawing more stuff from this

957
03:33:31,239 --> 03:33:42,459
community. That makes me ask what the heck am I doing? Take it easy. Much love. Hell yeah. Anybody

958
03:33:42,459 --> 03:33:52,709
that contributed to that card. Thank you. It was overwhelming. And yeah yeah once you cross the

959
03:33:52,709 --> 03:34:00,620
you can rent a car and you can be in a hotel room. They just sort of keep happening every year. That

960
03:34:00,620 --> 03:34:10,680
doesn't mean you shouldn't celebrate it. At least in a nominal sense right? But thank you.

961
03:34:11,500 --> 03:34:14,700
Man boy thanks for the thousand bits. Hey Jerma just wanted to share that after a pretty long

962
03:34:14,700 --> 03:34:24,200
time of trying I finally found my first job in a theater. Theater? Like a movie theater or a

963
03:34:24,200 --> 03:34:33,370
theater? Like a theater production. The pay isn't the best but everyone here is nice and I couldn't

964
03:34:33,370 --> 03:34:38,120
ask for a better first job. It was pretty hard and my mental health wasn't the best for most of the

965
03:34:38,200 --> 03:34:41,719
time but your streams always gave me a reason to be happy and laugh thank you.

966
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:55,860
That's awesome. He's on the screen right now. What do you mean? Oh there he is.

967
03:34:58,760 --> 03:35:16,379
That's great though. First job. That's a pretty good first job to have. Nice work. Hope you make

968
03:35:16,379 --> 03:35:26,090
some cash. And thanks for the 10 bucks. Take care of yourself. My first job was at a bowling alley.

969
03:35:26,170 --> 03:35:44,299
That's a good first job. It sucked. Still though, it's still experience. Thank you Vilemi for the

970
03:35:44,299 --> 03:35:48,940
2000 bits. Jerma I still don't see Jerma Psycho. I'm beginning to suspect you have lied to us about

971
03:35:48,940 --> 03:35:57,239
it. I may have lied about it but it's gonna happen. I gotta find the right image. All right let's test

972
03:35:57,239 --> 03:36:04,420
the credits. Do they work? Please? They do finally. It got reconfigured. Thanks to all the subs,

973
03:36:04,420 --> 03:36:12,569
community subs, old subs, new subs, all of you. Thanks for being the oil and moves the stream

974
03:36:12,569 --> 03:36:24,229
forward. Thanks guys. And thank you Vilemi for the 2000 bits. And again with for 300 here. I can't

975
03:36:24,229 --> 03:36:28,469
believe Jerma is a weeb now. That was when I was singing the song. I wasn't singing the song. I was

976
03:36:28,469 --> 03:36:35,850
just getting the pitch right. I don't even know how the song goes. He's grinding us into oil.

977
03:36:42,120 --> 03:36:47,879
Hey Al Stora H2O thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma my birthday was last week but I finally have the

978
03:36:47,879 --> 03:37:00,010
cash to send a message. Could I possibly get a QRS for the occasion? Yep. Yep. Oh I can't.

979
03:37:00,729 --> 03:37:13,030
I can't do it. I have to be like shit faced. I got I gave you three Qs. I can only do that when I have

980
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:28,620
had like four glasses of wine. You got you got Q Q Q. Why do you back away from the mic so it doesn't

981
03:37:28,620 --> 03:37:45,450
hurt your ears? If I went like yeah it would be so harsh. I only unintentionally hurt your ears.

982
03:37:45,530 --> 03:37:55,659
Not intentionally. He backs away from the mic to breathe. Yep. But happy birthday Al Stora. Hope

983
03:37:55,659 --> 03:38:00,950
you had a good one. Enjoy those Qs. Stinky Beaver thanks for the 250. Unfortunately I had to work

984
03:38:00,950 --> 03:38:04,629
all night tonight and missed all of Dead Rising. I was feeling kind of bummed out until I saw you

985
03:38:04,629 --> 03:38:11,290
alive. Thanks for making my night better. Yeah we finished Dead Rising. It was great. I got a little

986
03:38:11,290 --> 03:38:14,489
angry at the end but that's how it happens in video games. You just sometimes you just get

987
03:38:14,489 --> 03:38:17,930
frustrated and it's all good. That's what I tell myself in the mirror when I monologue tomorrow

988
03:38:17,930 --> 03:38:30,459
morning. Thanks for sticking around. Avery dropped dead thanks to the 500 bits. Hi Jeremy

989
03:38:30,459 --> 03:38:34,059
I just got off from work and I'm happy to see you playing Katamari again. It's one of my favorites.

990
03:38:35,219 --> 03:38:39,860
It's very good. I don't know what to say in this message but I love you and your content spreading

991
03:38:39,860 --> 03:38:44,659
good vibes and much love to you and everyone in chat. Also can you say hi to my discord server

992
03:38:44,659 --> 03:39:04,870
who also watches you. They're called poop shitters. That better be real. Thank you. Thank you Keith

993
03:39:04,870 --> 03:39:07,989
King Crimson for the 250. Really happy that you're playing more Katamari. It's my favorite game

994
03:39:07,989 --> 03:39:13,110
series. Also if you do a public domain movie night you should set up a green screen face cam

995
03:39:13,670 --> 03:39:16,709
and a movie see graphic so it looks like mystery science theater.

996
03:39:22,760 --> 03:39:31,590
At the back of my head that would be so dumb. Or just I'm at the movie theater.

997
03:39:34,729 --> 03:39:41,659
Make it a whole bit about it. Like throw shit at the screen. Get angry. Stand up. Like cause like

998
03:39:41,659 --> 03:39:52,299
a problem. Yeah that sounds like fun. Maybe I'll do that. But thank you Keith. Hey hoops thanks for

999
03:39:52,299 --> 03:39:58,020
the 500 bits. Have you considered playing bombastic the dice puzzle game. Keep up the fun content by

1000
03:39:58,020 --> 03:40:09,260
the way. Love watching you. I don't know what that is. Bombastic. I'm not sure. Mostly lost.

1001
03:40:09,260 --> 03:40:11,819
Thanks for testing the bits. I'm not going to read your message but thanks for the test.

1002
03:40:12,540 --> 03:40:20,420
Test works. Apple shift thanks for the 250. Hey have you had any wild dreams lately? I have wild

1003
03:40:20,420 --> 03:40:24,920
dreams all the time. I just don't remember them and I always tell myself I'm going to make a

1004
03:40:24,920 --> 03:40:29,399
dream journal where I get up and just turn over and write. But the one or two times I've tried

1005
03:40:29,399 --> 03:40:36,090
to do that I've woken up from a dream and then immediately want. All right do you guys do this

1006
03:40:36,090 --> 03:40:42,809
too? Some of you have to. Right when a dream is over you go holy shit that was fucking crazy.

1007
03:40:43,370 --> 03:40:48,409
That was so weird and interesting. I'm gonna go back to sleep and rewind and go over everything

1008
03:40:48,409 --> 03:41:03,620
that happened. And then you fall back asleep. And then you get up and forget everything. Yeah

1009
03:41:03,860 --> 03:41:10,280
okay. So I do every time I do that I don't turn over and write. I want to I want to re-watch it.

1010
03:41:13,540 --> 03:41:20,579
So my first thought is not to pick up like a notebook or a iPhone or something and write

1011
03:41:20,579 --> 03:41:29,700
something. I have some really weird dreams too. It's too bad. But yeah I do. Hey Zeg heart thanks

1012
03:41:29,700 --> 03:41:34,250
for the 250. I recently discovered that my 14 year old cat is seriously ill and I'll probably

1013
03:41:34,250 --> 03:41:38,540
have to say goodbye to him soon. I've been feeling completely heartbroken so thank you for cheering

1014
03:41:38,540 --> 03:41:49,799
me up a bit with your streams. Sorry to hear that. 14 is a nice long life though. Always remember

1015
03:41:49,799 --> 03:42:03,459
that. Hopefully you still have a good amount of time left. I'm really sorry to hear that. Thanks

1016
03:42:03,459 --> 03:42:18,120
for hanging out. Remember the time that you did have. More than a decade is such a long time.

1017
03:42:18,680 --> 03:42:31,000
The memories don't matter. Thank you for sharing. Thanks for the 250. Gnarly thanks for the 250.

1018
03:42:32,010 --> 03:42:36,969
As much as I'd love to watch you revisit Dead Rising 3 after playing the first two,

1019
03:42:37,690 --> 03:42:41,370
what if you went back to that Rome game you abandoned that was the sort of inspiration

1020
03:42:41,370 --> 03:42:48,219
for Dead Rising with the green blood enabled because my mommy won't let me watch without it?

1021
03:42:51,190 --> 03:42:59,909
Probably not. It's good to see the inspirations but sometimes the inevitable end product is just

1022
03:42:59,909 --> 03:43:07,670
way better than the prototype I guess beforehand. This is kind of one of those scenarios where

1023
03:43:09,319 --> 03:43:13,879
I play Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2. I wouldn't want to go super super backwards

1024
03:43:13,879 --> 03:43:23,399
to play their original game there. Interesting thought though. The shadows of Rome is by the

1025
03:43:23,399 --> 03:43:29,670
same people that made Dead Rising. I think it's by the same group of big directors or something.

1026
03:43:31,700 --> 03:43:39,819
Something like that. But yeah. Thank you Gia Norv for the 500 bits. German my first stream here.

1027
03:43:41,190 --> 03:43:46,309
What's up? Been watching your stream highlights on YouTube more so. Glad I subscribed. Seen a

1028
03:43:46,309 --> 03:43:55,979
couple people ask but if you haven't answered are you gonna play Code Vein? I wanted to. It just ended

1029
03:43:55,979 --> 03:44:02,250
up being one of those things that I got it, I bought it, and then it just ran out of gas before

1030
03:44:02,250 --> 03:44:12,250
I even left the parking lot. I want to get in that car but I have to walk gas from the gas station

1031
03:44:12,250 --> 03:44:20,040
to that car. There's just so much stuff, so many games, so many things I would want to stream.

1032
03:44:21,690 --> 03:44:27,610
But there's going to be a lull in stuff that I don't ever think that a game will never show

1033
03:44:27,610 --> 03:44:34,059
up on this stream because once we hit those times where two, three, four months go by and

1034
03:44:34,059 --> 03:44:47,180
there's nothing new to do, stuff like this would make an appearance. I play everything on this

1035
03:44:47,180 --> 03:44:56,500
stream. There's not very many things that I would not do. Maybe like a full game of Civilization,

1036
03:44:57,219 --> 03:45:04,090
something you would never see on this stream. Or strategy games. But even still, I don't think

1037
03:45:04,090 --> 03:45:16,620
that's even true though. Joel's movie is another one that comes to mind. Yeah. But welcome to your

1038
03:45:16,620 --> 03:45:26,379
first stream. I hope you liked it. Heroes of Might and Magic 3. I know, but that's a little

1039
03:45:26,379 --> 03:45:38,059
different. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is like different than like FTL. It is. Or like Civilization.

1040
03:45:43,940 --> 03:46:01,819
Salty? He's fucking salty. What the fuck are you talking about? Fucking goddamn fucking thing. No,

1041
03:46:01,819 --> 03:46:08,020
I can't do that. Half of the people here right now may not have been here like eight hours ago.

1042
03:46:08,739 --> 03:46:13,670
I can't do like the stupid fucking dumb fucking dumb fucking stupid. I can't do that right now.

1043
03:46:14,229 --> 03:46:30,340
There's a huge amount of context to that. Not really though, but still. But thank you Geonov.

1044
03:46:31,370 --> 03:46:37,180
Geornov. Welcome to the stream. Hope you enjoyed it. Modest Narcissist, thanks for the 500 bits. Hey

1045
03:46:37,180 --> 03:46:41,260
Jerm, I'm trying to lose weight for my first attempt at cosplay in May for a convention.

1046
03:46:41,819 --> 03:46:45,190
I've already made some small progress, but I was wondering if you had any fitness or diet advice

1047
03:46:45,190 --> 03:46:54,540
that you could impart on to me? Thanks in advance and have a good night. First of all,

1048
03:46:57,209 --> 03:47:04,569
it's a great first step to try to lose a little bit of weight. Hopefully your cosplay in May

1049
03:47:04,569 --> 03:47:12,500
turns out great. In regards to losing weight, I unfortunately cannot give you much advice

1050
03:47:12,500 --> 03:47:19,079
because I've been the opposite. My whole life has been I need to try to gain as much as I can

1051
03:47:19,639 --> 03:47:26,680
and keep and maintain weight, not lose it. So I don't really have very much advice to give you

1052
03:47:26,680 --> 03:47:37,879
on the losing weight front. Do not eat tahini if you're trying to lose weight. Do not listen to

1053
03:47:37,879 --> 03:47:45,000
anybody in this chat. Tahini, if you weren't here, tahini paste is the most high dense caloric food

1054
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:54,819
in the world. Do not eat that. But the real easy shit is just don't drink. It's just liquids take

1055
03:47:54,819 --> 03:48:00,700
up so many calories people don't even understand. Even shit like drinking orange juice, juices,

1056
03:48:00,700 --> 03:48:06,870
sodas. If you just cut out sugary drinks, somebody already said it, but I'm going to

1057
03:48:06,870 --> 03:48:15,270
parrot it because this is the way it is. If you start replacing all your high sugar drinks with

1058
03:48:15,270 --> 03:48:19,909
water or tea or even coffee, if you drink coffee, that's fine. Just don't put a bunch of junk in it.

1059
03:48:21,750 --> 03:48:26,540
You know, you can get a coffee from like a Dunkin Donuts or even a brew to the house.

1060
03:48:27,260 --> 03:48:33,290
You can put a sugar in there. You can put like a flavor pump in there, but just don't overdo it.

1061
03:48:33,290 --> 03:48:42,870
Don't go like six pumps. Cutting out soda and only drinking something like water.

1062
03:48:46,219 --> 03:48:53,819
There are, that is hundreds and hundreds of calories a day that you're not taking in. Diet

1063
03:48:53,819 --> 03:48:59,899
soda. No, I don't drink diet soda. Diet soda may not have sugar, but it still causes an insulin

1064
03:48:59,899 --> 03:49:05,020
response. It's just as bad as normal soda. I don't, I don't, I don't know the science on all that,

1065
03:49:05,020 --> 03:49:13,290
but I just know that diet soda is, you know, you're not really doing anything for yourself.

1066
03:49:14,250 --> 03:49:18,409
If you're drinking diet soda because you want to lose weight or because you want to drop calories,

1067
03:49:19,860 --> 03:49:30,979
you're still drinking soda though. You're not like solving that problem. Diet soda

1068
03:49:30,979 --> 03:49:38,229
fucks up your system. Yeah, but, but more so you're still drinking soda and it's so easy to

1069
03:49:38,229 --> 03:49:44,229
just go back to drinking a regular soda because you still drink soda. It's like snorting coke,

1070
03:49:44,229 --> 03:49:52,500
but it's healthy. Coffee's terrible for dieting because the caffeine messes with your dietary

1071
03:49:52,500 --> 03:50:04,520
instincts and appetite and it triggers insulin. Yeah, drink tea, but that's, it's rough to say

1072
03:50:04,520 --> 03:50:14,700
that to somebody though, because coffee is so, I love coffee. I love coffee. And if somebody told

1073
03:50:14,700 --> 03:50:21,110
me, dude, you can't drink coffee anymore, I'd be like, you can fuck off. I'd be like, nope,

1074
03:50:24,780 --> 03:50:35,319
but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I just love coffee. And eventually here,

1075
03:50:35,319 --> 03:50:38,760
probably soon I'm going to have, I'm going to probably have to change my diet a lot

1076
03:50:38,760 --> 03:50:50,120
because I'm getting older. You can't just like pound coffees and fucking creamers. I don't drink

1077
03:50:50,120 --> 03:50:59,719
cream, but you know what I mean? It's like not good for you. If you drink a bunch of coffee,

1078
03:50:59,719 --> 03:51:04,360
it's just, I don't want to have like hypertension or something later on in life,

1079
03:51:09,690 --> 03:51:13,370
but unfortunately I can't give you that much besides general stuff like drink more water.

1080
03:51:13,370 --> 03:51:20,629
And that's so basic. You could find that on any blog post. I unfortunately can't help you with

1081
03:51:20,629 --> 03:51:24,950
weight loss. And I don't want to tell somebody, well, here's what you do to lose weight when I

1082
03:51:24,950 --> 03:51:32,379
have no idea. I can't do that, but I wish you luck. There's tons of great literature out there

1083
03:51:33,100 --> 03:51:45,850
for losing weight healthy. Good luck in your, for your convention cosplay. Hope it's a good one.

1084
03:51:45,850 --> 03:51:52,340
Thank you, modest narcissist. Reaper, thanks for the 250, Jerma. I have an old S E. Do you want

1085
03:51:52,340 --> 03:51:59,129
to buy it? Now you've bugged it. Nope. It doesn't matter. You could have that. I could have that

1086
03:51:59,129 --> 03:52:05,290
cleared by like a tech that it's not bugged. It's still bugged. You bugged it. Thanks for the offer

1087
03:52:05,290 --> 03:52:13,420
though. And then finally we have anonymous. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey Jerma meant to mention that

1088
03:52:13,420 --> 03:52:18,219
those baby ducks will be combating an invasive bug species that's arrived on the East coast.

1089
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:23,930
The duck you named will have thousands of offspring to help the environment.

1090
03:52:24,809 --> 03:52:28,489
Also, if you ever want to know a good reptile, ask me. I've owned everything and I have over

1091
03:52:28,969 --> 03:52:38,569
7,000 gallons in reptile enclosures alone. Holy shit. That's a pretty crazy couple of sentences.

1092
03:52:41,159 --> 03:52:49,110
Prepare the ducks for battle. Also, when's metal gear revengeance DLC?

1093
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:14,059
Well, to be fair though, did I ever say I was going to play? Yeah, I probably did,

1094
03:53:16,700 --> 03:53:20,780
but I don't know. Like, Hey, I just finished the game. Will you play DLC? Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

1095
03:53:21,500 --> 03:53:34,889
No, you can be floaty and aloof with DLC in my opinion. He promises too many things.

1096
03:53:39,379 --> 03:53:45,860
You don't have to complete DLC because it's added content. You can be floaty with it. You can.

1097
03:53:48,780 --> 03:53:58,139
He just hates video games. I think I did say that like three times during the Dead Rising stream.

1098
03:53:59,020 --> 03:54:08,469
Oh well. Just like Dead Rising 2. What's the plan for tomorrow? We're going to finish Katamari

1099
03:54:08,709 --> 03:54:15,739
Beautiful. And then after that, Mystery stream. We'll see. Got a few things we can do.

1100
03:54:21,750 --> 03:54:28,709
And I'll see you tomorrow. Same time, same place. Take care guys. Thanks for watching as always.

1101
03:54:28,709 --> 03:54:35,270
Thanks for sticking around. For someone who makes a lot of wild references, he sure doesn't want to

1102
03:54:35,270 --> 03:54:43,559
make the classic guild he promised us. Yeah, but I opened up Warcraft and I got to like level seven

1103
03:54:43,559 --> 03:54:49,670
and I said, fuck this game. I'm not doing this again. I just didn't want to do it and it was

1104
03:54:49,670 --> 03:55:01,190
like a lot and it takes a lot of time. It takes a huge amount of time. It's a fun idea. I tried and

1105
03:55:01,190 --> 03:55:13,459
then I said no. So that was a lie. No, that was an attempt. I downloaded WoW Classic. I paid for a

1106
03:55:13,459 --> 03:55:20,020
subscription. I opened the game and I had the intention to make a guild and I got to level

1107
03:55:20,020 --> 03:55:25,860
seven and I said, I'm not doing this. I didn't lie. I gave up. There's a difference.

1108
03:55:35,299 --> 03:55:44,840
Bring back the polygraph. Polygraph stream two. Giving up is worse than lying.

1109
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:56,440
Well, whatever. So what do you want me to do? You want me to force myself to play WoW Classic

1110
03:55:57,079 --> 03:56:03,850
to get to level 60? So I can open a guild bank and we can what? So we can just

1111
03:56:04,569 --> 03:56:13,750
put like 500 stacks of thorium in there? I'll get to 60 and I probably won't play the game anymore.

1112
03:56:16,700 --> 03:56:20,940
You know what would happen? I would have put a bunch of time in and got to level 60 in WoW.

1113
03:56:20,940 --> 03:56:25,260
All right, level 60. Let's go guild. And then I would have just fucking flaked and never

1114
03:56:25,260 --> 03:56:31,420
played the game anymore. I would have just quit. Is that worse than giving up at level seven?

1115
03:56:32,819 --> 03:56:43,459
I think so. You would have 5,000 people carry you through it on a golden carriage.

1116
03:56:45,219 --> 03:56:50,420
I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. That sounds like so not fun.

1117
03:56:51,139 --> 03:57:00,940
What do I do? Watch people kill mobs and like hand me items? I don't want to do that.

1118
03:57:01,659 --> 03:57:07,379
I would just be like, all right, guys, I got to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to log off.

1119
03:57:11,209 --> 03:57:20,280
Just carry him around. I wouldn't even want to stream that. Oh, that would be so.

1120
03:57:21,239 --> 03:57:30,579
What would I even do? What would I even talk about? We could just fan you with giant leaves

1121
03:57:32,180 --> 03:57:38,870
and feed you grapes. The highest bit donator gets to be the one you slash follow.

1122
03:57:39,829 --> 03:57:58,680
That would be the dumbest stream ever. It wouldn't even work because if I,

1123
03:58:01,620 --> 03:58:07,139
if there was a quest I was doing and there was like 100 people, 200 people around me,

1124
03:58:08,100 --> 03:58:11,860
I would never complete a quest. All the mobs would be dead and people would just be like

1125
03:58:11,860 --> 03:58:22,729
trolling and killing mobs. I would never complete a quest. Please just do a carry me around stream.

1126
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:29,159
Are there any other games where I could just be like carried around and just do nothing and

1127
03:58:29,159 --> 03:58:43,110
just get stuff? What other games exist that could do that? I just don't have to do anything.

1128
03:58:48,219 --> 03:58:51,659
The MMO streams. Yeah, they were a mess. They were fucking hilarious.

1129
03:58:53,459 --> 03:59:11,479
Rust. All right. Get in the Discord. Let's wrap our brains around this. If you can find me a game

1130
03:59:12,360 --> 03:59:21,739
where I can just be the sultan that just sits on a throne and just doesn't do anything and has the

1131
03:59:21,739 --> 03:59:44,389
game played for him and everything is given to me, everything, the title of that stream would

1132
03:59:44,389 --> 04:00:04,329
just be called the sultan. The title of the stream should just be called Lazy Fuck.

1133
04:00:17,559 --> 04:00:26,170
The Lazy Fuck. Does anyone really want to watch that stream? I know I'm sitting here laughing,

1134
04:00:27,129 --> 04:00:30,809
but I don't think very many people want to watch the Lazy Fuck stream.

1135
04:00:31,690 --> 04:00:43,139
And by the way, if I die, the stream ends. No bullshit. I will turn the stream off if I die.

1136
04:00:43,139 --> 04:01:03,290
If I have to even exert any fucking force. All right. Let's look into it. That sounds like fun.

1137
04:01:04,329 --> 04:01:12,700
We need a game where people could assassinate you. Okay. Somebody mentioned rust. If I buy

1138
04:01:12,700 --> 04:01:31,819
like a 500 person rust server, is that possible? No, this is so stupid. All right. Let me look into

1139
04:01:32,299 --> 04:01:47,290
this. Floats of my ideas in the discord. It could be Minecraft, Roblox. Yeah, I'm actually

1140
04:01:47,290 --> 04:01:53,370
going to look into it. Just do Dark Souls 3 with phantoms. No, I would want there to be at least

1141
04:01:53,370 --> 04:02:01,139
a hundred people on screen. All like just doing everything for me. I want people whose sole job

1142
04:02:01,139 --> 04:02:09,540
is to like chop wood and bring it to me. Even if they don't even need it. The Lazy, the fucking

1143
04:02:09,540 --> 04:02:24,760
Lazy Sultan stream. How many people can you have on Minecraft server? Can you have like

1144
04:02:24,760 --> 04:02:35,979
a thousand people on a Minecraft server? Okay. How much is a 1,000 slot Minecraft server?

1145
04:02:46,780 --> 04:03:10,489
It's like 300 bucks a month. It would be for one day. Oh my God. I need to

1146
04:03:10,489 --> 04:03:12,729
think about this a little more. This sounds really funny.

1147
04:03:15,479 --> 04:03:28,520
Multiple rounds. We could even do multiple games. Planet side too. No, I ain't doing that again.

1148
04:03:29,399 --> 04:03:34,120
If you die in the first 10 minutes, that would be such a waste.

1149
04:03:35,690 --> 04:03:41,129
And I'm not even saying bye. The second I die, the streams off. Like you killed me and like I'm dead

1150
04:03:41,129 --> 04:03:48,420
in real life. You guys need to work together to make sure that does not happen. The second that

1151
04:03:48,420 --> 04:04:06,299
my HP is zero. Oh, off. See you next time. He's going to jump in the lava for fuck's sake.

1152
04:04:07,659 --> 04:04:10,620
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Sleep on this idea. It's fun.

1153
04:04:11,579 --> 04:04:18,149
Yeah, no bits or no just the stream will be offline if I go to zero.

1154
04:04:20,170 --> 04:04:25,270
See you guys tomorrow. Have a nice sleep. Good night.
