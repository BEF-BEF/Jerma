00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:36,390
All right. Hello. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. I was in pre-stream chat talking for a

2
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:46,280
little too long. I didn't manage my time well and I'm technically 50 minutes late. Although,

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:55,030
I did update it and technically I'm 20 minutes late. It's all right. It was good talks. It was

4
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:06,010
a good talk. It was good talk. It was. Yeah. Hello. Welcome back. If you were here yesterday,

5
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,250
we're going to do the same thing we did yesterday. Going to keep going through Resident Evil 4.

6
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:19,900
I think I'm about halfway through the game. Seems like I'm about,

7
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:32,040
there's probably another 12 hours left. So after tonight's stream, if I stream for,

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:40,500
you know, five to seven hours tonight, there'll probably be maybe one more at some point midweek

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:52,659
next week. After I finish Resident Evil 4 remake, we're going to go back into Breath of the Wild.

10
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:01,939
I'm not going to promise that I'm going to complete Breath of the Wild in this time period next week,

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,900
but I'm going to continue progressing through it. Maybe one or two streams of Breath of the Wild

12
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,099
and we'll see. I don't want to rush through Breath of the Wild. I don't want to sprint as fast as I

13
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:20,710
can through it. I saw some concerns saying, hey dude, you're going to sprint as fast as you can

14
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:27,080
through that because you want to just be done with it, don't you? And I typed yes, but then I

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,479
deleted it and said, no, that's not going to happen. So I'm not, I don't want to do that.

16
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,840
No, I'm kidding. I'm going to take my time through it. Like I already have.

17
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:54,520
When does a new one come out? May? May, May 12th. I got plenty of time, but I'm not going to play.

18
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,629
I don't think I'm going to play the new Zelda game the day it launches. There's plenty of time

19
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,379
to play the new one. I don't know. Maybe I don't. Do I? We'll see. Breath of the Wild came out in

20
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:13,449
2016. It took me like seven years to play it. So I don't know. Well, I don't know. We'll see.

21
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,169
I'm already setting him up for disappointment. I'm already setting you guys up for disappointment.

22
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:27,129
Well, you know what? It took me six years to play the other one. Like what? Why wouldn't it take me

23
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:34,500
years to play the new one? There's a lot of sadges in chat, I think, after that one.

24
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:50,740
2017. Yeah. What about Hilux 2? Oh yeah. I don't care, bro. Actually, that's like kind of cool.

25
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,800
Yeah, that's like, that doesn't bother me. To me, you just said, hey, man, I don't even care.

26
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:05,270
Do whatever you want. All right, thanks. The one guy of the year. That's one guy of the year for me.

27
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:22,839
I care. I care. It's all right to care. Hey, I care too. Yeah, I'm already really late. So I

28
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:32,100
don't we're gonna we're just gonna go. What was the last thing I did? I'm already late. I stall for

29
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:48,089
20, 30 minutes every stream anyways. So let's go. I was in the castle. There he is. Yes, face cam.

30
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,300
Face cam. Yeah, I turn it on. This is the time to turn it on. I told you guys the 2023 philosophy.

31
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,329
I feel like turning it on. I'm going to turn it on. I feel like I felt like turning it on

32
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:14,779
the last couple of weeks. Going off real goddamn soon. All right, let me take a sip. Oh, okay.

33
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:23,029
So what was the last thing we did? Head for the ball. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just did the

34
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:33,459
shooting gallery shooting game thing. What is in here? Oh, it's none of these like square key

35
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:54,550
things. There's three of those. Thank you. Want a tip? If you want to do a good laugh,

36
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,319
a good kind of laugh like I just did. A lot of people think, oh, breathe in.

37
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,029
No, no, no, you do it. That's not correct. Get a little bit of air out first.

38
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,180
Because then it's literally just like your diaphragm doing the work. Don't go too hard,

39
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:31,990
though. Be careful. He's doing theater lessons. Yeah, theater lessons. Dude, your breath smells.

40
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,990
Yeah, so here's the difference, right? Listen to the difference.

41
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:59,589
Which one sounded better? The second one. Yeah, it's all about, you know, breathing control and

42
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:10,329
diaphragm control. Now that that does not mean go and like choke. It's all about just breathing and

43
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:22,100
diaphragm. I'm not expelling that much air when I do that. What is he talking about? I don't know.

44
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:31,060
Who got us on this? All right, we're going to go this way. Cool. Sweet. Turn it up for me. How's

45
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:45,829
the volume? Is it kind of low? Turn it up a little bit. You did. Sorry. All right. There's the head.

46
00:07:46,629 --> 00:08:03,139
Oh, it's one of those people. Oh, yeah. You almost started a new sandwich. I'm in a

47
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:31,209
fucked up mood tonight. I'm sorry. It's already starting. Where is he? Oh, you piece of shit.

48
00:08:31,209 --> 00:09:04,299
Whatever. I know where he is. No, stop backseat gaming, Ashley. Come on. Stop backseat. She's

49
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:38,139
backseating. Quick die. What is this head made out of? Fucking metal. What is? Oh, my God. This is

50
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,379
a bad start. This is off to a really fucking bad start. This is a bad start. Did he suplex me?

51
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:59,419
All right. That was a bad start. That was a bad start. It's a bad start. I was a bad start.

52
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:03,500
My arrows are bouncing off of his head. They were just bouncing off of his face.

53
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,610
All right. This time I'm not going to let him do that. We're not gaming tonight.

54
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:29,580
Nowhere. I gotta just get back in the swing of it. I'm taking this guy out immediately.

55
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:55,240
Eat this. No. Blow it up. How do I blow it up? How do I blow the mine up? Why doesn't

56
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,039
take the food out of the microwave? How do I do that? How do I blow it up?

57
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:13,379
How do you blow up the mine? How do I blow the mine up? It's a proximity mine. Oh,

58
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:27,220
it's a proximity mine. So what if I attach it to his body? Does that count as movement?

59
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:51,909
Yes. So I just have to aim better. Okay. Here we go. He's still alive. Oh, my God.

60
00:11:51,909 --> 00:12:19,029
Get up. I thought she said she was okay. She just dropped. Stop. Why is this so stressful?

61
00:12:29,139 --> 00:13:02,250
What? No. Are you dead? She keeps getting fucking suplexed. He's finally dead. Ow.

62
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:30,230
Must have slipped. That was so horrible. You hurt? I'm good. Thanks. You know that move

63
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,909
that they do in wrestling where they take your body flat and you're lying kind of down,

64
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:40,070
facing down and they press you up and they hold you there and it's like,

65
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:50,309
then they let you go. That happened to her like five times. They just like push you up and then

66
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:59,779
let you go after a while and you're just like pancake onto the mat. Yeah. It's called the

67
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:10,409
griddle press. Yeah. Wasn't that the ultimate warrior's finishing move? The ultimate warrior

68
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:16,059
would sprint. Oh, the ultimate warrior was ridiculous. The ultimate warrior, if you don't

69
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:25,940
know what his shtick was, he had like this superhero symbol was painted on him, whatever

70
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:33,340
it was. I don't know. I don't remember. He was in a speedo and his entrance music, he would sprint

71
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:42,009
as fast as he could into the ring. He never spent, I don't think it was ever more than three seconds

72
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,019
they took him to get to the ring. He would just sprint out there running as fast as he can and

73
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:54,500
then he would just be going like for 20 minutes in the beginning of the fight and he would grab

74
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,179
the ropes. He would grab the top ropes. You know, those three ropes. He would grab the top one and

75
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:08,070
fucking shake it like this like four or five times during the match. It was fucking crazy.

76
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,070
And that was that was his finishing move. He would press you in the air while doing the

77
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,980
and they would fucking let you go. That was enough to like kill you apparently, whatever it was.

78
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:40,659
Oh, old wrestling was just so out of control. This dude loves violence.

79
00:15:40,740 --> 00:16:12,059
He loves murder. Wrestling is, I mean, those guys, they put their bodies through hell. But to me,

80
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:20,009
I always loved wrestling because it was sort of like a series of real-life Looney Tunes gags.

81
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:25,799
Just kind of chained up together. There's a lot of athleticism that goes into being a wrestler.

82
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,340
I just loved the, it was like a cartoon. It was like a living cartoon with real superheroes.

83
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:52,539
It was great. All right. Is there anything else here? Well, 20 more of those are in here. All

84
00:16:52,539 --> 00:17:19,369
right. There's only two more. Did I miss any other items? Maybe. Did I already go up there?

85
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:25,940
This bullets I didn't get. Where is that? I think it's on the actual thing over here.

86
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:44,440
Yeah. Are you frozen? It shouldn't be. If I'm frozen on your screen, then I might need to refresh.

87
00:17:45,240 --> 00:18:07,460
All right. There's that one. What? It bounced off this guy. But this guy, honestly, it's the tank.

88
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,289
You know what? Yeah. You specked into tanking. You already have a tank behind you. You ruined

89
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:30,170
the party. And look what happened. The overzealous DPS ran in, took one hit, fucked everything up.

90
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,279
The tank went in front of the tank. Then the tank dies because there's no DPS. It's just,

91
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,799
just absolutely. They're probably swearing at each other in a discord call right now.

92
00:18:39,799 --> 00:19:04,309
We're talking real friend ending shit right there. Uh, let's go here. I got everything in it. I'm

93
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:12,579
going to go save it though. You could cosplay as Leon and pull it off. Uh, I would need to wear,

94
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:20,180
uh, tall shoes, I think. Isn't Leon like six, two or something? It feels like six, three.

95
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,059
Welcome. Where would it, what can I do you for a lot of money?

96
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:45,500
Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. Well, that's our choice to make.

97
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:53,740
He's five 11. He's five 10. Really? Next time then. Oh, maybe he is. That's all right.

98
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,019
I don't know. Like there's only like three inches that I need. I could do that.

99
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:25,240
All right. Let's go. I can't go that way down this way. Probably be five 11. Well, I'm five

100
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:50,549
seven, five eight with shoes. I love wearing dress shoes, dressing up for an event because those

101
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:56,839
things give you at least, at least like 0.8 inches, like at least one full inch. That's great. I walk

102
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:03,339
around like I'm fucking boss. I mean, I'm saying I wear dress shoes and I got that extra inch,

103
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,940
extra inch and a half. I walk around like I'll fucking own the place. You know what I'm saying?

104
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:33,029
Oh, a lot. Do I have enough to finish this right now? It's three square, three. I could put it all

105
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:45,990
in here and probably make a hundred grand. Should I do that? All right. What's better filling this

106
00:21:45,990 --> 00:22:00,680
with only reds or taking those over here and finishing it? It's just filling the crown up

107
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:09,589
and selling it. We're better than just putting all reds in here in red, all red, all red. If you have

108
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:17,339
all different colors, it's a hundred K. I don't know if I'll be able. Oh, wait a minute. I can do

109
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:28,059
that. I'm going back. Hold on. I can do that. I have enough to do that. Come on. I think I have

110
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:38,339
enough. I don't know. Yeah, I do. I have green, purple and red and then I have red and wait,

111
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:56,740
can I not do it? I need a blue gem. I wonder if he sells one. What does he sell? Okay. So we got

112
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:18,009
green, purple, red. Oh, then red. Wait, I can red yellow. So if I had a blue instead of this

113
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:29,019
red one, it would be worth a hundred thousand. What does he sell? All right. I'm going to hold

114
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:38,710
onto it then because that I don't think I've ever done that before. I need a blue gem. That's a

115
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:46,359
guaranteed hundred K if I can find a blue. Pretty sick. Pretty cool. Come on. No problem.

116
00:23:46,359 --> 00:24:03,220
It's an achievement as well. Oh, cool. We're here. Talk about a fox in space again. Yeah.

117
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:12,410
I had the privilege of cameoing in the second episode of Fox in Space. Can we get a link to

118
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,410
it? Give one of the mods, put it in the chat. It was really, really cool. I don't want to spoil

119
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:28,460
anything, but it's very quick. It's like 10 seconds, I think. So if you see it, you'll see

120
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:46,170
it. It's really, really cool to be any part of that at all. So there it is. Do more voice acting.

121
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:59,059
Yeah. I, over the years, so I had a lot of passion to like do like voices and stuff and make sound

122
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:06,089
effects. So you guys know that it's like 70% of every live stream. But I think my, my happiness

123
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:11,849
and my passions lie in kind of doing it here. Like I just have fun doing it in front of you guys,

124
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,210
rather than other characters or something. I think just fun to do it. I know three voice Andy,

125
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,970
three of four voices Andy. I know, but it's still fun to do it here. I have like more fun doing it

126
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,259
kind of here rather than like in a studio booth or, you know, under a recording session or I

127
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:50,180
actually have more fun doing it. Just walking around. I don't want to miss anything. Somebody

128
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,259
asked like how did I might be making this up and somebody to say like, how did you learn that you

129
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,910
could do that? Or how did you like want, how did you know you wanted to or something? Um, I've

130
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:05,190
always just been an incredible, incredibly high energy person. Even when I'm sitting around and

131
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:14,180
that's ADHD, right? That's part of it. But it was always, I just like had, I just had to expel

132
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,549
fucking energy. And that was kind of the way it did it. And that sort of led into my adult life,

133
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:28,250
which is kind of weird, but I just, I always just had a lot of energy and it was actually kind of

134
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:43,579
a problem when I was younger. It got me. Hold on. Oh, they're climbing. They're climbing. What just

135
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:58,710
happened? Put me out. Put me out. Do something. Put me out. Oh shit. Well, Ashley, what are you

136
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:46,460
like a grenade? No, no, this is auto-saved. Wait, I knew I heard it. Take that damn mask off of

137
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:59,740
Ashley. I, it's a unlockable. It's only been off for like two minutes. Why don't I

138
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:28,490
open this? Hey, stop that. All right. Come over here. Are you all right? Thanks. I got to go kill

139
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:36,039
the guy that makes all the blog. That's called come out of your head. I guess got to die now,

140
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:52,119
like immediately I'm sprinting right to that guy spread out and you know what? Stay back. Don't

141
00:28:52,119 --> 00:30:03,420
even come over here. Where is the mage or whatever it is? Where's the mage? With me.

142
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:11,940
Where's the mage? Oh, oh, you're dead. All right. Cool. I guess I accidentally killed that person

143
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:22,759
with a grenade. Finish the story. What was, what was I saying? Give me like one keyword and I'll

144
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:35,130
help figure it out. What was it? High energy as a kid. Oh, I mean, enemy, that kind of stuff gets

145
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:42,059
into trouble, right? Like trying to not be, not being able to be quiet and always having to like,

146
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,779
I needed to move around all the fucking time and it was kind of a detriment. So a lot of times,

147
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:59,400
but over the years I've obviously gotten a little better. I don't need to be down here.

148
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:23,000
I think I had high energy as a kid, but I was better at masking it. Yeah. I mean, everybody is,

149
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,700
everybody's different, right? So my situation versus your situation versus somebody else's

150
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,599
situation is always going to be different, but I had a lot of, you know, communication with,

151
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:41,769
you know, doctors and family and it was, uh, everybody's different. That's why it's kind of

152
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:47,769
a, usually a case by case basis a lot of times. All right. Where am I? I wonder if I need to go.

153
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:52,890
I'm going the complete wrong direction right now. How did I end up going back here?

154
00:31:53,529 --> 00:32:00,390
Why did I go back here? I mean, it was cool. I got some kills, right? But what was it? What am

155
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:13,940
I doing over here? I'm sitting here explaining how I've had, Oh, ADHD over the years. And I've,

156
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,319
as I've been walking fucking backwards the whole time, that's just par for the course. I think,

157
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:38,519
isn't it? I rode the train all the way back here. All right. That was actually a nice,

158
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,519
that was actually a lot of help. I appreciate that actually.

159
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,529
Forget how to parry. No, I just feel like people have been behind me the whole time.

160
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:03,059
All right. Let's just, we're going to wait. Let's go. Just go, just go do the suplex. Oh, I will.

161
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:23,539
I tried to parry that and you can't parry that. Get out of here. I'm getting money at least.

162
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:42,279
I am just, I could have taken the cart back. Yeah, it's all right. I'm walking through the

163
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:48,890
whole game again. This is just absolutely quintessential. I know where I'm going.

164
00:33:50,009 --> 00:34:05,900
No, you don't. I'm already in too deep though. I have to keep going. At least every door is open.

165
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,130
Hi. Are you all right? Yes. I seriously went so fucking far. I have to go through the whole

166
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:35,320
maze again. Should I just restart? No, I can go through here. No big deal. It's just a straight

167
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:54,460
path from here, is it? Is it a straight path from here? Through the left. Let's do a factory reset.

168
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:06,539
No, I'm just going to run. We're good. Glad I came back. It's 200 bucks.

169
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:25,860
Oh, I did not think that that was going to be here. Hey, we made it and I got the,

170
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:39,079
the uh, the goat head or whatever it is. This took us an extra five minutes to start.

171
00:35:44,360 --> 00:36:05,480
Ah, this shit is ice cold today. Perfect. Okay. So, uh, I was going the right way.

172
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:17,210
I went back here from the cart, which I did not want to do that. I need to go up this way.

173
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:34,099
For a reason stranger. You're here. Maybe this is locked. It's locked. Here we go. Rats have

174
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:41,030
infested a section of the castle and are gnawing away at all the precious books. Uh, get rid of

175
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:49,860
the rats in the grand hall library. Imagining that's in here. Yeah. I don't know. I really

176
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:55,300
don't like doing this, but I'm gonna really don't like it. I don't want to shoot these rats.

177
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:12,730
I don't like it. That's something sacrilege about what I'm doing. This is, I don't like this. I

178
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:32,630
really don't like it. I don't like it. Statue of some snakes. I don't like it. Betrayed. Betrayer.

179
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:45,829
Dining hall. Oh, here. No, thanks. Puzzle time. Okay. The stork is looking at that chair right

180
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,150
there and that chair is sitting across from these drapes. These drapes are spread open. That means

181
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:56,539
two, one and two on either side, which is these two, these two are exactly 15 feet apart, which

182
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:06,469
is 15. Count to 15. One, two, three. That counts as four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There

183
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:09,989
are only 10 seats. So subtract 10. So that means five. The answer to the door is five.

184
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:47,260
E is the fifth letter of the alphabet. All right. I'm done. It's like grandpa's birthday picture.

185
00:38:47,900 --> 00:39:27,909
Are they eating napkins? All right. Two knives, fork, spoon, three knives, two forks, spoon. Okay.

186
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:39,820
And it was, that's his. He had two knives, eating a napkin, two knives, fork, spoon.

187
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:49,110
No, no. This is it right here.

188
00:39:49,750 --> 00:40:29,610
Have a seat. No problem. Looks like we figured it out. Take it. Serpent head. The last one is over

189
00:40:29,610 --> 00:41:06,199
here. I probably unlock it somehow. What is this item? Oh, it's this. Put this back on. Looks like

190
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:28,760
we're still missing a piece. There's a symbol on the wall. You hear it ticking. All right. I need

191
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:50,039
the, uh, I need the last head and it was in line. All right. I need the lion head. How do I get this?

192
00:41:50,039 --> 00:42:11,369
Oh, should I miss an herb? What season are you? Uh, I like summer and winter both equally the same.

193
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:22,760
Where's this red herb? Oh, it's on the table. Summer and winter are my two favorite seasons.

194
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:31,079
Although if you're talking about smells, all smells the best. All has the best smell.

195
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:45,849
All has the best smell. Summer has the best body feel. Spring has the best visual and winter has

196
00:42:45,849 --> 00:43:03,050
the best togetherness. There you go. I had a big raid. We got a big raid came in. Linkus. Thanks

197
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:13,769
for the raid, Linkus. Appreciate the raid. Welcome everybody. Togetherness. Yeah. That means usually

198
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:20,099
you can't really, winter is a kind of an indoor, um, season. I mean, unless you're, you know,

199
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,900
going skiing or you're out, uh, you gotta really bundle up. To me, winter is more like I'm drinking

200
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,539
a hot coffee or hot cocoa or something and I'm inside and we're watching a movie. You know what

201
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:39,659
I'm saying? I think that's pretty accurate for me. Maybe it's not accurate for you. We're different

202
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:48,250
people. This dude's addicted to coffee. I mean, probably. All right. What am I? Where's this last

203
00:43:48,250 --> 00:44:19,260
head? We're here? Is there a door here? Oh, look, there might be a door there. They actually might

204
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:41,340
be. Yeah. Welcome, Raiders. There is a door there. Hey, Leon, there's some armor. Bet you could use

205
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:54,389
it like a bulletproof vest. Little old fashioned for my taste. Too bad. I'm pretty dashing. These

206
00:44:54,389 --> 00:45:02,570
are going to move. I don't, I don't remember what happens in here, but we'll see. There is one more

207
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:21,219
of those right here. What is making that sound? I lost all my channel points voting for a turtle

208
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:28,500
in pre-stream. Sad. I don't even know the context of what you're saying. What does that even mean?

209
00:45:30,360 --> 00:46:25,449
We were, where was there a turtle? There it is. What the hell? I need some yellow herbs. Ashley,

210
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:44,949
stay up there. Hey, be careful. These guys move. These guys move. There's no way these guys don't

211
00:46:44,949 --> 00:47:07,960
move. Get all the items first. That's Resident Evil 101. Welcome to class. When you touch the thing,

212
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:15,429
25 enemies are going to run after you. Collect everything first. Everything. That is Resident

213
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:33,260
Evil 101. Welcome to the lesson. We're clear. I'm ready to start the encounter. Can't be serious.

214
00:47:37,400 --> 00:48:18,179
That count? Oh, you can't parry that. That's not getting parried. Jesus. Oh shit. Oh shit.

215
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:58,280
Oh, you can parry it. What did you just do? What's going on?

216
00:49:24,019 --> 00:50:02,519
Dude, I'm out. I'm out. I'm going to have to switch over to this. Damn. I'm almost out of

217
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:12,889
everything. I got no ammo. I'm almost completely clean out of everything.

218
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:36,309
Is this where this weapon is going to really shine? Because I got nothing. Time to utilize the weapon

219
00:50:36,309 --> 00:51:02,619
that has infinite ammo if you're good. Stop minus twoing Leon. That's kind of rude. Yeah. Stop.

220
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:18,900
Oh, there it is. I got the cube. Hold on. I forgot to blink for like 45 minutes. Oh, damn.

221
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:51,989
Damn it. I need to save this ammo. There's one more somewhere in here.

222
00:51:52,869 --> 00:52:06,420
One more wrap. Hook up a shock collar to have minus two and plus two activated.

223
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:15,380
If it's really bad, I just get electrocuted. How would that work? If there's more than like

224
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:25,079
500 minus twos in chat, I get shocked. I don't think so. What happens if I get a bunch of

225
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:39,960
plus twos then? What's the reward that I get? You get candy. A cookie. A candy dispenser.

226
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:50,579
A candy dispenser? What kind of weird experiment is this? There's just like a device that's in the

227
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:54,420
corner over here that if I get enough plus twos, like a little candy comes out and I'm like,

228
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,820
oh, I run over there and I unwrap it. What the hell kind of, what is the stream that you're

229
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:31,019
referring to? That's the idea. Matilda. I don't like it. I don't like first fire.

230
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:45,019
I always land the first shot and the other two just miss. I'll hold on to them for now.

231
00:53:45,420 --> 00:54:00,920
I'll buy most anything. I don't always have this in stock stranger. Stocking up while you can.

232
00:54:44,730 --> 00:55:02,039
Say something. I'm fine. I need to do a big turn in here. I've got like $200,000 worth of

233
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:24,489
shit in my inventory. W A S D Q E. Okay. I need that on the bottom. Is that correct? Yeah, that's

234
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:45,510
it. Where's the, there's another one of those. Where is it? It's over here, isn't it? That's it

235
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:58,500
right there, right? All right. It's somebody, I don't even know what the fuck that person's saying.

236
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:05,510
All right. This, that's it. It's, it's, it's back there. I'm going to take the car because I want

237
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:11,820
to go do the other cube thing because I will forget and I will not do it. It also might be over here

238
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:41,619
too. Why not yourself? Okay. Time to go on the car. Just behind me. This way. Okay. What do you

239
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:54,150
say? It's a fancy car. I don't know. Melt that thing down and go rebuild a fucking school.

240
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:58,070
You know what I'm saying? Like this thing, that could be made out of wood. It could be made,

241
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:10,059
it could put some nice gold trimming on it. You know what I mean? Like does that gotta be a $10

242
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:21,340
million? It could be a $1 million card. Does it gotta be a $10 million card? All right. Where is

243
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:31,300
it? Or is it up or is it across? Is it across? I think it could be a $5 million card. That could

244
00:57:31,300 --> 00:58:09,300
be a $5 million card. All good. He's malding over golden pixels. I ate breakfast this morning. If

245
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:23,460
anyone's curious. No, he's supposed to fail. He's supposed to fail those puzzles for 20 fucking

246
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:51,159
minutes. I wasted my candy. Where's the candy dispense? Okay. But acting superior. Hey, this is

247
00:58:51,159 --> 00:59:09,719
it. Imagine if I ever have a Disneyland ride to go to the kitchen, pause the movie and go to the

248
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:14,679
kitchen to get the popcorn. You need to get on a Disneyland ride to get there? I don't know, man.

249
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:24,900
I think that's a little, I think that's a little much. I think that's a little much. I hate big

250
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:30,820
fucking spaces. They piss me off. I don't know why. I do know why. Cause I lose shit all the time.

251
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:43,110
I need just a few rooms. You know what I'm saying? Too many places for me to, I would get lost.

252
00:59:56,150 --> 01:00:01,909
Got to take Splash Mountain to get to your living room. I mean, that's like fucking funny.

253
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:16,460
That would be so annoying after a while. Okay. Well, what if, what if you do the Splash Mountain

254
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:23,820
ride to get to your, get to the kitchen and then you take like the, you know, the monorail back to

255
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,059
the living room and then you realize I left my fucking phone on the counter in the kitchen.

256
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:36,389
You have to ride Splash Mountain again. That would suck. You'd be like, I don't want to ride that

257
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:44,019
again. Or is it a case of you have so much money that you, there's a phone in every room?

258
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:56,389
You know what I always did want? This is back, um, back when cell phones really weren't a thing.

259
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:06,010
I always wanted one of those phones next to the toilet. I thought of, you know how much shit I

260
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:33,219
would be able to get done? I'd be able to get so much stuff done. This is loud. What are you getting

261
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:49,400
done? Meetings. That'd have to be a bunch of sound dampening. There's gotta be a bunch of sound

262
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:54,760
dampening in that room. In that room. I just said run because I'm about to run and my brain

263
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:21,429
replaced the word. Um, God, hold on. Ah, shine forward. That sounds like, um, like motivational

264
01:02:21,429 --> 01:03:13,159
speak. Shine forward. That rat was fast as fucking, oh my God. Is that a clock? Resting

265
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:19,480
forbearers answer to the chosen time. It is it. If it is the Lord's blessing you seek,

266
01:03:19,480 --> 01:04:09,980
have courage and fear. No darkness. Chosen time. What time is it? I got a watch. You know,

267
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:20,179
it's really, really interesting about all this. Are these real, are these real paintings from

268
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:28,969
or were these made specifically for the game? Think about the time and the effort that an

269
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:36,679
artist went into to do this. And it lives as this set piece to create this environment.

270
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:53,260
It's really cool. You just don't, you don't really even think about it, right? So as I walk through

271
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:59,579
these doors, somebody had to make all this. Somebody had to put all this here. That turtle

272
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:14,679
was placed here very particularly by somebody. I think we kind of forget that a lot. Sorry about

273
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:30,659
you losing all the, uh, all your money or whatever happened to you. Wait, why? I'm sorry. I just

274
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:41,769
ruined that whole moment I was having there. I hate that. I don't like when they're under that

275
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:23,800
hidden staircase, a secret room or something. Shit. I don't have that device. Bunch of keys.

276
01:06:26,869 --> 01:07:27,539
Break this. Ashley can't kick that. God damn it. It can't get in here, right?

277
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:44,760
Oh, my God. It's this one. Whoa. Close the door. Close the door. Close it. Close it. Close it.

278
01:08:44,760 --> 01:09:35,140
Close it. Close the door. Oh, shit. No. Leon, help. The key to getting out of this confounded

279
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:40,119
place is the Salazar family insignia. To find it, I must venture to where that cursed armor

280
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:48,069
awaits the underground mausoleum. Oh, merciful Lord, enact your righteous justice upon the wicked

281
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:55,050
surfer, the maniacal monster Ramon Salazar. May your blessed blue light protect your forever

282
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:13,180
faithful servant. Ooh, wait, what time is it? It is exactly almost four o'clock. Oh, wait,

283
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:28,489
do I know what this is? I mean, hold on. Let me, I don't open that yet.

284
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:55,899
1104. 1104 o'clock. I bet that works. I didn't use one of these keys,

285
01:10:55,899 --> 01:11:15,579
so I missed out on something, but whatever. One hundred thousand dollars. There it is.

286
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:47,449
Let me save it first. I don't think I did. All right. 1104 is right here. Give me a candy. Yeah,

287
01:11:47,449 --> 01:12:25,960
I got a blue gem. Give me a candy. All right. The other one is 1104. God damn it. The power

288
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:31,800
of the blinding light. I sentence you to hell. It works. Oh my God. It works. I forgot it worked.

289
01:12:31,800 --> 01:13:35,539
I thought I was making a stupid joke. 1104. 1104. Quickly. Am I good? Am I safe? This is the scream

290
01:13:35,539 --> 01:14:18,569
stream I've been waiting for. Well, just that section is just. Did they take that? Did they

291
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:22,489
take the elevator? Oh, I thought they took the elevator down. I was like, why do they have

292
01:14:22,489 --> 01:14:30,869
intelligence like that? All right. Don't press any buttons until I know what the hell's going on in

293
01:14:30,869 --> 01:15:05,909
here. OK, bird, moose, seahorse, snake, bird, moose, seahorse, snake, bird, bird, whatever, snake.

294
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:20,390
That's true. That's the best line of the whole game so far. This sucks.

295
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:41,670
Whoa. Oh my God. This doesn't close. That person. Wait, there was a gem in that eye.

296
01:15:42,390 --> 01:16:29,989
How do I get it? I don't know. I need the. I get it. I get it. This sucks. That was great delivery

297
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:46,420
too on that line. That was very. That was like 10 out of 10 delivery. Is that correct? I need to flip

298
01:16:46,420 --> 01:17:24,409
these. That was an insane puzzle. Oh, I don't even. I don't even have the thing. I don't even have

299
01:17:24,409 --> 01:18:08,260
the lantern. Did I? Did I fuck that up? Oh God. What am I? The only one I haven't used. I just

300
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:28,119
almost exited the game. Holy shit. What the hell? Come on, come on, come on. Oh, that sucked.

301
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:55,060
I wonder if that's harder on a professional or hardcore. It's not over yet. God damn it.

302
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:22,489
God damn it. OK. Oh shit. I don't know where to go. Dude, I don't know where to go. I have no idea

303
01:19:22,489 --> 01:20:09,060
where to go. Where do I go? Around this way? This is wrong. This is the wrong way. It's over here,

304
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:33,109
isn't it? Straight. No. Wait, it's not right here. Are you serious? No, I'm going the right way.

305
01:20:33,109 --> 01:21:19,449
Stairs with a diamond is the right way. Oh, I knew that. Go. Thank you. Thanks for the help.

306
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:52,649
Change the outfit. I will. That was terrifying. Elpers. Oh, you need to be really sure about that,

307
01:21:52,649 --> 01:22:24,500
bro. I can catch you. I think so. Oh yeah, there are the two weird predator enemies.

308
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:54,060
God, about that. That was a long chapter. That was all the hedge maze and everything. Time for

309
01:22:54,060 --> 01:23:10,859
break? No, not yet. Maybe like another half hour, 40 minutes. Maybe like an hour. Sorry, nothing yet.

310
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:19,350
But my little helper is creating quite the commotion. Everything will work out just fine.

311
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:26,779
As long as you can keep your dog under control. Seven minutes. He's a good boy. Predictable.

312
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:59,699
Fine. Change your mind yet? Aida. Assuming you haven't. I've got a tip for you. How about a

313
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:13,060
FaceTime call? Seems like something big is about to go. Babysitting is tough. Hey, Aida. Aida.

314
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:17,899
That's such a funny concept. Now you're getting FaceTimed by Aida in this situation. It's like,

315
01:24:17,899 --> 01:24:22,699
yeah, all right. Hey, you do the thing where you're like, hold on. Wait, I need to make

316
01:24:22,699 --> 01:24:31,880
the corner way bigger so I can see how ugly I am. Hey, Aida. You know what I mean? Like,

317
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:47,500
you gotta make sure I look all right. Okay. I have $100,000 waiting for me over here.

318
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:14,729
I'm about to do a cool thing. Here we go. So we've got, she has it. She has it in her inventory.

319
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:27,449
Oh, well. Welcome. Got some rare things on sale, stranger. Well, this is the ultimate shotgun.

320
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:47,770
Body armor is less expensive now. Yeah. Look at all this stuff I have. I have to sell something.

321
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:59,579
I'm MinMaxAndy right now. I gotta sell, I have to sell something.

322
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:14,810
She dropped it. They're on the ground. What? Is that for real? She dropped it.

323
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:25,380
Oh, I am so glad that you said that because I, she didn't do that. She didn't say,

324
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:32,020
hey, Leon, turn away a little sack over and else she threw us the key. All right. Well, good to know.

325
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:58,949
Let's do it. Green, purple, red, blue, yellow, 100,000. It's a full two times bonus. Yeah. I

326
01:26:58,949 --> 01:27:03,770
think this is the best possible thing you can do in the whole game, right?

327
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:16,220
Is there another five slotted item? All right. I could do this one too. I need, I want money.

328
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:27,270
I'm doing it. I want money. This can be filled in. You can do all red on this one,

329
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:43,880
which would be pretty cool. Look at this. Quad bonus. Oh yeah. That's, I don't think I've ever

330
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:50,970
seen that much money in the game. Here we go. 100,000, 60,000.

331
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:56,729
Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. I just got an achievement for that.

332
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:15,289
All right. Now we're going to make some decisions here. I'm going to sell this shotgun. It's

333
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:22,600
another 152. Wait, I'm going to put the thing on. Hey, brief 4k is three or 4k. You know what I'm

334
01:28:22,600 --> 01:29:00,439
saying? Three or 4k is three or 4k. I'm doing it. Oh yeah. All right. I have $292,000 to get this

335
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:11,239
thing to be ridiculous. Semi-automatic shotgun.

336
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:36,359
Oh, okay. Hold on. Oh my God. It's so expensive, but it's crazy.

337
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,520
I need some reload speed.

338
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:57,270
All right. This thing is disgusting right now.

339
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:11,109
This thing is filthy. You just emptied your whole account. Yeah. Into this.

340
01:30:14,649 --> 01:30:17,130
You don't have any ammo for it. Fix that right now.

341
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:32,489
Welcome stocking up while you can. I knew you too. Pleasant.

342
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:54,840
Wait, I want to put the shotgun ammo thing on shotgun shells. Craft bonus. Okay. Shotgun

343
01:30:54,840 --> 01:31:15,859
craft bonuses on six. This thing has 18 shots. Damn. All right. That's the, I can't wait to

344
01:31:15,859 --> 01:31:31,380
use that thing. That thing is disgusting. You can hold 25 and I still remember I still have

345
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:43,930
what? Like 20 shots in the revolver. I've got 20 shots. I am ready to kill any boss in like four

346
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:55,560
hits. All right. How are we looking? Got some decent heals. I got pretty bad on ammo, but that's

347
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:01,960
why I'm going to use this for a little while. I'm going to replace, let me put this in a better spot.

348
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:27,319
All right. Let's move outfit change after this next little bit here. So where to? I did that.

349
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:38,739
Now the idea is I have to go this way. Let's go in. I want to go into the library back this way

350
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:57,859
because I want to open, I want to get the cube thing and then it's open to the right, right?

351
01:32:57,859 --> 01:33:15,029
Right. Ashley is literally dead. Ashley is not dead. Wait, what's this? This is game progress

352
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:25,210
over there, but I don't want to do that yet. I seek a brave soul willing to dispose of that monstrosity

353
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:30,039
of a knight. Be warned is much stronger than the other as he cut down our best of the singles to

354
01:33:30,039 --> 01:33:52,250
defeat the strong threat in the mausoleum. I don't think I need it. I don't need it.

355
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:43,779
I don't even need it. That's done. Yes. I actually do need to do this because I need

356
01:34:43,779 --> 01:35:17,289
ammo and there's a lot of stuff to break down here. Let me turn this over. I missed every

357
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:22,119
single shot. Every, I should get an award for that. I should be given something for that.

358
01:36:01,979 --> 01:36:41,399
Hi. I'm trying to save ammo. Oh, right in the throat. All right. I'm missing a couple of

359
01:36:41,399 --> 01:37:03,670
arrows. Where are they? Am I missing arrows? Okay. So the thing is yellow diamond. Nice.

360
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:26,100
Not quite that way yet. I'm looking for that cube cube thing. I think it's actually upstairs.

361
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:37,850
They never break, but they can go out of reach. There it is. All right. What the hell's in here?

362
01:37:37,850 --> 01:38:18,460
Oh my goodness. CQBR assault rifle. Damn. This was free. He uses rifle ammo. I'm probably

363
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:27,100
going to sell this and just put it all into the striker. That's really cool though. All right.

364
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:36,630
What else we got? I'm going all in. Yeah. That's how I play it. I don't spread it out. No, no, no.

365
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:41,350
I take, I pick one weapon and I put a million dollars into it and it kills every enemy in one

366
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:48,680
shot. Yeah. I got to be careful. I got to aim the shots well, but it kills every boss in three hits.

367
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:53,500
Just put a million dollars into one weapon and you don't have to worry about using other weapons.

368
01:38:53,500 --> 01:39:04,180
Use other weapons. Why? Having 24 shotgun shots that deal 5 million damage. Why use the rifle?

369
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:14,470
I don't need to do that. All right. Let me go out this way. There's another one up here too.

370
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:37,020
It's in here. Yep. There it is. You can only kill 24 enemies. That's not accurate.

371
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:54,939
Golden links. Nice. Oh, the boss, a boss. It has a lot of help. I could finish this right

372
01:39:54,939 --> 01:40:05,800
now. Or I could finish this one too with the triple. I wonder what's worth more. I think that

373
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:19,880
does it. So now I'm going to go this way. That's the game progress route. You are so bad. Why?

374
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:47,239
What are we talking about? Oh, you don't want to have like an omega shotgun. All right. Triple

375
01:40:48,039 --> 01:41:16,630
37k. That's pretty good. 37, eight versus 40. All right. It's more economically viable to do this

376
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:39,189
one. It isn't 1.2 versus 1.4. This is going to affect the economy. It's fine. It's all right.

377
01:41:45,350 --> 01:42:11,779
It's fine. It's fine. This thing's worth 20k. What is it to make the shotgun ammo? I need the blue one.

378
01:42:20,489 --> 01:42:37,779
Thank you. Try that on for size. Let's go. 16.2 damage. Anything else I place in travel.

379
01:42:37,779 --> 01:42:45,720
This thing is disgusting. It's going to kill everything in one hit. Stryker is the weakest

380
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:57,609
shotgun by far. I'll be, you'll see. I'll be fine. You'll get it. I made a new save file just in case

381
01:42:57,609 --> 01:43:25,880
I completely fuck myself here. Magnum's already on and shotgun is already on, right? So we got

382
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:36,170
shotgun melee crit hit rate and Magnum crafting. The first shotgun has 25 points when maxed. Yeah,

383
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:41,960
but you can't go gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung and get the cut scene. You know what I'm saying?

384
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:49,189
Boss. I make the boss drop down to one knee. The Plagas comes out. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

385
01:43:49,189 --> 01:44:15,640
boom. Cutscene. I think I'm going to be all right. All right. Back to it. Here and then left. All

386
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:26,489
right. We'll see. Somebody said, all right, we'll see. I got to sit closer to my desk. I have to

387
01:44:26,489 --> 01:44:55,210
like reach over to get my drink. I'm too far away. The people want a new outfit. Oh shit.

388
01:45:04,810 --> 01:45:21,979
I'm saving ammo. Look, look at how good I'm being. Fucking monsters. You just chose the

389
01:45:21,979 --> 01:45:28,460
most controversial weapon in the Resident Evil community. How do you feel? Um, same as I did 10

390
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:40,810
minutes ago. What do you mean? Why is this? What do you mean controversial? Why is it so controversial?

391
01:45:56,739 --> 01:46:20,539
Ow. That was, oh, okay. That's fucked with me. That was a really long window. I did not think

392
01:46:20,539 --> 01:46:25,260
that window was going to be that long. I committed then I didn't commit and I committed and I didn't

393
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:59,510
commit. Lost an arrow. Take a shot in the ceiling. You must smell awful. I don't think so. Shotgun.

394
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:38,300
This thing doesn't even have a full slugs. Oh, good. I have a lot of health. All right. What's,

395
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:45,060
what, what's, what's controversial about what I did? Remember, try not to make every single

396
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:58,810
chat message as mean and referring to him challenge. Now, if one of these birds just went

397
01:47:59,529 --> 01:48:17,859
wham, that would be scary. Oh, purple herb. That's max health, max ammo, and a full heel.

398
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:27,220
I can't fucking believe I found one. All right. July 2 years since my awakening,

399
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:33,460
Master Ramon has bestowed upon me a truly righteous undertaking to improve upon the flaws of our human

400
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:41,270
form, to seek perfection as observed in our anthropodal siblings. This cause I shall willingly

401
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:49,079
devote my life. January 4 years since my awakening, my efforts to transfuse the black liquid into the

402
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:56,039
body are at a precipice of success. The womb is the key. If your soul proves to be a highly

403
01:48:56,039 --> 01:49:02,979
malleable and adaptive subject, and then a bunch of other bullshit that they did or something,

404
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:32,859
well, you can read it on your plate. It really was like another paragraph or two.

405
01:49:37,619 --> 01:49:45,979
All right. I promise I will read the notes from now on. I will read the notes. I promise from now

406
01:49:45,979 --> 01:51:10,630
on. Hey, oh my goodness. I didn't even fucking flinch. Where is this last one? Where is this?

407
01:51:19,899 --> 01:51:35,180
This gave me a headache. I have a fucking headache. Where even was he?

408
01:52:30,420 --> 01:53:04,859
Nice. Ow, my finger. How do I get over there? One, it's been like 15. I don't want you to die

409
01:53:04,859 --> 01:54:23,079
there because I won't be able to get the item. I don't think they stopped spawning. What the fuck?

410
01:54:23,079 --> 01:55:13,819
That thing was made out of stone. Get out of the fucking way. Get, get. Okay. There's still a

411
01:55:13,819 --> 01:55:28,359
treasure. Where's the treasure? Get away from, I'm trying to get the treasure. Fuck off. Oh my God,

412
01:55:28,359 --> 01:56:22,840
you're an annoying little shit, aren't you? Okay. How do I get out of here? That way. Oh wait,

413
01:56:22,840 --> 01:57:22,149
I want all the items, everything. Come on. I want everything. Give me everything. I feel like I've

414
01:57:22,149 --> 01:57:26,680
been walking around here for like an hour. How long have I been walking around this place?

415
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:40,220
Did that not wait? What did that just open? Did that not open this? Wait, what just happened?

416
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:57,500
I didn't, I didn't open that gate. There's one on the other side, isn't there? Feel you right behind

417
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:53,699
me that way. I have to fight up the ladder. I tried to parry it. I just suck. I'm getting so

418
01:58:53,699 --> 01:59:20,890
many blue sapphires. Finally. Pretty good, pretty good farm spot. Yeah, I'll take it.

419
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:48,869
Got a lot of handgun ammo. How come you skipped the night boss? Oh yeah, I did. I didn't mean to.

420
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:28,619
I forgot. Why is it painted? Oh, you're able to go back right now? I really don't want to run

421
02:00:28,619 --> 02:00:42,090
through all these bugs again. Are they, are they gone? No, they are not. I missed it. Sorry,

422
02:00:42,090 --> 02:01:27,609
I missed it. It's all there is to it. I missed it. It's okay. Another time. Oh shit. Oh shit,

423
02:01:27,609 --> 02:01:40,180
that's those. I was silent before. Now I'm not. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm not quiet anymore.

424
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:43,779
They just, they got up. They're out. They're out. All right. This is why I,

425
02:01:43,779 --> 02:02:09,239
this is the reason why I got this weapon. Just like I fucking planned. It's got to be the boom,

426
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,800
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom in the back. And I'm going to kill one in a second.

427
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:39,939
Ready? Here we go. Flashbang going out. What is this? What? What happened? I couldn't shoot him.

428
02:02:41,819 --> 02:02:50,460
It's not hitting him. What's going on? Is the armor on the back have to be taken care of?

429
02:02:52,119 --> 02:02:56,899
I think it's the armor on the back is not gone. I shot the wrong one.

430
02:02:56,899 --> 02:03:00,180
Whatever. All right. It's the point still stands. That would have been awesome.

431
02:03:02,119 --> 02:03:11,140
Okay. And dude, only use this. They can't hear this. It's silent.

432
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:16,539
Just wait till they come over here. Take them out one by one. Quietly.

433
02:03:19,130 --> 02:04:15,670
Only headshots. Only. I gotta go. Can I pull them out of his head? Quiet. We have been silent.

434
02:04:16,939 --> 02:05:44,300
We're very good. Extra bolts. I hate it. No way, dude. Somebody just threw something at me.

435
02:05:44,300 --> 02:06:09,779
I think they just spawn forever. They do. They just spawn forever. Okay. Well, you know what?

436
02:06:09,779 --> 02:06:36,380
Then come on then. Come on then. Come on. What? Why can he hear me?

437
02:06:56,060 --> 02:07:20,090
I don't want to use it. Oh my fucking God. Okay. All right. I got a fucking, I got a,

438
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:30,420
I got a flashbang. Nice shotgun. I haven't even had an opportunity to use it. Don't even give me

439
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:46,739
shit for that. I've got to make the floggers come out and then unload. I'm just going in.

440
02:07:46,739 --> 02:09:34,199
I'm going in. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was dead. I fucked it up. What the fuck just happened?

441
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:45,659
I'm made out of fucking. All right. I'm going to do it fucking. I'm going to do it for real now.

442
02:09:45,659 --> 02:10:21,300
I'm going to do it for real and not get shit. Push four. Why can I not press a

443
02:10:21,300 --> 02:11:00,310
button on my fucking keyboard? I always press like two accidentally. Get out of my fucking way.

444
02:11:34,069 --> 02:12:10,090
Yeah. I got a beer back. I shit my pants. All right. Two unicorn horns. That was so scary.

445
02:12:10,090 --> 02:12:17,979
Does anybody else have this problem where you got one, two, three, four on your keyboard

446
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:29,000
and from W going from W to three or two, I always end up going like this. I hit just like three of

447
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:54,229
them, but I just, I can't do it. It was worth it. I got to use the mines. No, I made this bed. I

448
02:12:54,229 --> 02:13:20,739
have to sleep in it. Remember the Magnum that you're never going to use. I will use it. I'll

449
02:13:20,739 --> 02:13:28,659
use the Magnum just wait. I just like stabbed myself in the eye with my fingernail. I was,

450
02:13:28,659 --> 02:13:33,699
that's so annoying. I so badly wanted to scratch my eye with my other hand when I

451
02:13:33,699 --> 02:13:47,109
could have just used the right, the actual, the left hand too busy gaming. No, we're good.

452
02:13:47,109 --> 02:13:58,010
What treats do you want? Um, I'm good right now. I think I got everything. All right. Let's go.

453
02:14:03,609 --> 02:14:09,020
I also didn't even have a working knife that whole time. Turn the lights off. They're already

454
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:46,550
actually.

455
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:16,279
Just kind of mask on this.

456
02:15:38,890 --> 02:15:39,609
Kennedy.

457
02:16:16,409 --> 02:16:48,229
Hang in there, Ashley. I'm coming for you. I'll be fine. Give up the ghost. Anything down here?

458
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:58,329
Oh, I remember this part is so scary. If I remember it's when, yep. Oh, I hate this part.

459
02:16:58,329 --> 02:17:16,280
This is the sewer, right? Oh, it's the worst. It actually is awful. Talk about sticking the landing.

460
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:54,010
Bugs. Get the fuck away from me. Where is that? Where this place? Lots of blue gems though.

461
02:18:54,010 --> 02:19:54,549
You guys weren't lying. Don't do that. Oh shit. Okay. They move so fast through the water. It

462
02:19:54,549 --> 02:20:33,860
sucks. Probably an item down here. It's going to run item. Run, run, item. Run. Really? Nothing,

463
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:53,620
nothing at all. I guess a little bit of these things heal for a hundred percent health.

464
02:20:53,620 --> 02:21:20,780
If I put that keychain on, maybe I should farm a couple here. There's another place to go.

465
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:37,940
Yeah, there's an item over here. Do this IRL. Twix or payday candy bar. The people need to know

466
02:21:37,940 --> 02:22:03,370
Twix every day. Twix all day every day. I can't get that. I really, really want that. Which,

467
02:22:03,370 --> 02:22:07,770
which, but left or right Twix. I open the package and close my eyes and just like spin it around

468
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:10,649
and spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin. And then I just take one. I can't decide.

469
02:22:11,290 --> 02:22:33,290
Probably drop down here. I'll read it. Another one dead. How long has it been since I was thrown

470
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:37,860
down here? The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are gone and they don't give us

471
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:43,190
anymore. The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable. Most have resorted to drinking

472
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:51,909
the black water. The first to turn was Herminio. He was so weak that he couldn't even walk,

473
02:22:51,909 --> 02:22:57,530
but then suddenly became mad. By the time his rampage ended, two were dead. I think we shouldn't

474
02:22:57,530 --> 02:23:06,579
drink that dark liquid. Dear Abelardo has passed, though he fought until the very end. The only thing

475
02:23:06,579 --> 02:23:12,389
I can do now is honor the bodies and pray that their souls find peace. Oh Lord, why do you test

476
02:23:12,389 --> 02:23:42,180
us so? Another crown. Another crown. I can do a triple in here. We'll see. Okay. I really do badly

477
02:23:42,180 --> 02:24:02,579
want that item down here and I'm going to get it. There we go. Okay. Finally. No, no, no, no, no, no,

478
02:24:02,819 --> 02:24:45,559
I already have one made. Cool. I need to repair this. This thing filled back up. Very nice. Give

479
02:24:45,559 --> 02:25:11,350
me a break. It's this part. I hate this part. I'm just going to warn everybody. I'm probably going

480
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:20,229
to scream at least five to 10 times during this part. Um, there's nothing I can do about it.

481
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:31,540
This is where the game turns into a granny like and it's a granny like on crack. Uh huh. It's

482
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:35,379
not going to be fun. Very much not looking forward to this is probably my least favorite

483
02:25:35,379 --> 02:26:02,170
part of the whole game is this next hour or so. Yeah, well I'll take a break. Let me just do this

484
02:26:02,170 --> 02:26:29,420
first. Oh, that's a lot of gunpowder. You have anything new? Let me take a look at this shit.

485
02:26:35,239 --> 02:26:45,700
Three blues will fit in here and I'll be just fine. Although is that going to be bad for later?

486
02:26:46,180 --> 02:27:04,819
25k. I think it's fine. 7,000. So let's do, let's just get these in here.

487
02:27:16,309 --> 02:27:23,510
But anytime welcome got a selection of good things on sales, a deal well struck.

488
02:27:26,329 --> 02:27:30,329
You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.

489
02:27:30,329 --> 02:27:35,610
If you're interested in something more, well, you catch my drift. Let's see.

490
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:41,850
Rolls are gross. All right. Here's the problem. It's 30 well tuned weapon can make up for a

491
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:49,780
this is going to have almost 50 shots in it. You don't even have the ammo to fill one magazine.

492
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:56,440
I'm all right. I still got money to put into this. See, everything's going to be fine.

493
02:28:02,139 --> 02:28:08,520
You're the worst resident evil four player. No, I'm using a gun you don't like.

494
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:16,920
Let's just get this. We're starting to get an idea of your taste.

495
02:28:25,450 --> 02:28:37,430
What you see is why I don't always. I use these so often. I'm just going to use it. You know what

496
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:54,840
I mean? Yourself killed now. Very cool. I could put the thing on and just use this and get a full

497
02:28:54,840 --> 02:29:22,889
heel. That's what I mean. Let's top myself off. I'm going to get topped off. Okay. I'm going to be our

498
02:29:22,889 --> 02:29:31,350
bee. I'll be right back. And from here, I'll put on a new costume and we'll be right back.

499
02:29:31,350 --> 02:29:35,190
Give me like two, three minutes, maybe five minutes or so in a minute.

500
02:35:05,670 --> 02:39:28,659
Okey dokey. How are you? Refilled my drink. Got a little bit of stretches out of the way.

501
02:39:28,899 --> 02:39:41,500
Move my legs a little. Preparing myself for this part coming up. I'm talking this up like crazy.

502
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:59,510
Watch this. Not even be a big deal. No, there's no way it's not. Okay. Hello. Can you see me?

503
02:39:59,510 --> 02:40:15,750
Not yet. You will be in a minute. Comfortable. Turn the gamma down on this. Is the lighting fine on

504
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:33,620
the? I'm a little orange. I mean, it kind of looks like that in here anyways. Whatever. I'm good.

505
02:40:33,620 --> 02:41:00,840
Let me know if the audio is not any good because I had to change it for the music.

506
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:04,520
How bad would you laugh if in 10 hours I can't beat the game because of the shotgun I have and

507
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:10,329
I have to go back and do this and get the rifle? I would laugh out loud. Oh my God. I would laugh

508
02:41:10,329 --> 02:41:43,670
out loud. Outfit change. You're right. You're right. Hero or villain? Villain in cut scenes,

509
02:41:43,670 --> 02:42:12,500
I think would be really funny. Let's do villain for now. I guess we'll do that for now. Bro,

510
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:26,940
take the glasses off. No, the glasses stay. The glasses stay. I look like I'm in the fucking

511
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:32,180
night's watch. This is going to be so distracting. I already know it. I can't wait to turn it off.

512
02:42:32,180 --> 02:42:49,639
I already hate it. Well, everything's good. Move. Look like a Bloodborne character. Yeah,

513
02:42:49,639 --> 02:43:09,989
the Bloodborne mod. What is? I hear it. Where is it? Here it is. Okay. No more stalling. It's time

514
02:43:09,989 --> 02:43:23,209
to go. But there's a treasure over here and I'm going to get it. Ooh, I think I can make a new

515
02:43:23,209 --> 02:43:51,379
thing. Oh, not even close. Chris Angel. Do you get partial credit for that little side quest or do

516
02:43:51,379 --> 02:44:08,280
you have to get all 16? Dude, you look like a buzzard. You got to get them all. Installation

517
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:11,479
of the liquid nitrogen showers that were requested last month have been completed.

518
02:44:12,200 --> 02:44:23,110
Caution. Liquid nitrogen is extremely hazardous. Yep. It's this part. I'm not going to scream.

519
02:44:46,569 --> 02:44:51,260
May, nine years since my awakening. Upon the release of this valve, black liquid shall enter

520
02:44:51,260 --> 02:45:00,680
my veins and circulate throughout my entire body. I expect this will be the most painful experience

521
02:45:00,680 --> 02:45:06,120
of my life. I await the trial with great anticipation. It is an honor to suffer through

522
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:12,309
the holy labor of rebirth. The next time I awaken, it will be as a true servant of master Ramon.

523
02:45:12,950 --> 02:45:20,969
I, Isidro Uriarte Talavera, make this vow. I will surpass the limitations of man and become

524
02:45:20,969 --> 02:45:27,450
a true servant of God. I will find the heretics and serve as their executioner. Their verdugo.

525
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:52,489
On powder. These people are not right. You have a long time to figure that out, Leon.

526
02:45:58,149 --> 02:46:12,149
Oh, a boot knife. Put that on. Put the boot knife on because I think I can use it to kick,

527
02:46:12,149 --> 02:46:19,030
right? Especially for this part. Hold on. There's more shit here.

528
02:46:21,989 --> 02:46:26,409
Out of service. To conserve electricity, the power has been turned off for some equipment,

529
02:46:26,409 --> 02:46:31,100
including the elevator. It can be restored by flipping the circuit breaker. Look at at the

530
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:57,340
very back of the laboratory. Great. Where is it? I can hear it. Oh, I'm looking right at it. Nice.

531
02:46:57,899 --> 02:47:18,920
Make sure I get everything. I think I've got everything. All right. I'm not going to scream.

532
02:47:19,479 --> 02:49:12,149
Oh, did I waste it? I can hear this motherfucker. Oh, it's at C. C is the worst place for that.

533
02:49:12,149 --> 02:49:36,069
I can't rely. If we press C, let me get all the items in here first. I know there's probably a

534
02:49:36,069 --> 02:50:41,270
couple. Let's go. What did I not do this? Why did I not do this earlier? Why did I not do this

535
02:50:41,270 --> 02:51:03,100
earlier? Why did I not do that earlier? Press the button. Press it, please.

536
02:51:32,569 --> 02:52:33,219
Oh, my God. My God. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Oh, my God. Press the button,

537
02:52:33,219 --> 02:53:30,760
please. You fucking dumbass. Press the button. Where's E? Oh, shit. It didn't work. Oh, my God.

538
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:36,520
Oh, my God. Fucking greedy. I'm so greedy.

539
02:54:17,420 --> 02:55:00,059
Fucking gross. All right. We're not leaving yet. Imagine that on a higher difficulty. Oh, yikes.

540
02:55:00,059 --> 02:55:09,850
Is my least favorite part about the whole game? Not because I don't like it, but because it's

541
02:55:09,850 --> 02:55:14,229
just so scary and so stressful. It's a granny-like disease just constantly running after you.

542
02:55:14,229 --> 02:55:26,739
Oh, yeah. There was one more nitrogen. I was panicking too much. It's not easy on hardcore.

543
02:55:26,739 --> 02:55:32,899
I do not envy people playing on hardcore or professional against this fight because it

544
02:55:32,899 --> 02:56:03,110
fucking sucks. I want to get in there. This door, right? Good. Oh, I'm really glad I came in here.

545
02:56:05,290 --> 02:56:12,729
You made that look pretty easy. The only reason why I did not lose probably three or four times

546
02:56:12,729 --> 02:56:18,229
there is just because I've done it before. I knew you had to do the nitrogen spray,

547
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:24,329
but it still kind of doesn't matter. It's still a big scary monster running after you.

548
02:56:32,469 --> 02:56:49,000
I should... How am I doing on items and stuff? Now, here's a little tidbit. You actually don't

549
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:57,819
have to kill that thing. I think most people's first playthroughs, they'll probably just get away.

550
02:56:58,620 --> 02:57:08,629
You actually don't have to kill it, but I wanted to. You can outweigh it. Yeah. You can just kind

551
02:57:08,629 --> 02:57:23,079
of run around in a circle. That's why I made all the flashbangs, by the way.

552
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:56,940
Salvation, as you wish.

553
02:58:05,239 --> 02:58:08,200
Coming back to that is just not... You're never prepared for it.

554
02:58:09,079 --> 02:58:27,379
I've already turned. My character has already turned. I've been completely infected at this

555
02:58:27,379 --> 02:58:40,809
point. Oh, you get points for actually killing it. That's cool. Pretty good score. That's pretty

556
02:58:40,809 --> 02:58:50,739
good. I'm not playing on hardcore, but I think that's pretty good. I'll take a 90. Second

557
02:58:50,739 --> 02:58:55,500
playthrough will be hardcore. I don't think I'll ever do professional, though. You need to be

558
02:58:55,500 --> 02:59:00,860
next level with your aim and awareness and... I think it's like you die in like one or two hits,

559
02:59:00,860 --> 02:59:19,239
right? There's no autosaves or anything? Can't you only save like five times or something in

560
02:59:19,239 --> 02:59:42,229
professional? Something awful? 15. This character does not belong here.

561
02:59:42,709 --> 02:59:45,510
Why help me, though? What's in it for you?

562
02:59:46,790 --> 02:59:50,069
No need to be suspicious. I said I'd help you, didn't I?

563
02:59:55,340 --> 03:00:15,299
Nice OC. I haven't got the red contacts in. Make your way to the surface. Everybody's so winded in

564
03:00:15,299 --> 03:00:34,379
the remake. October 11. Today was the worst day of my life. It's my daughter's fifth birthday,

565
03:00:34,379 --> 03:00:40,569
but here I am stuck on a mangy boat heading out to some backcountry dump. If it weren't for the

566
03:00:40,569 --> 03:00:47,180
pay, no one would be willing to work out in the middle of nowhere a week later. Those in the castle

567
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:52,059
are always reminding us to take care during the excavation, but a few workers collapsed after

568
03:00:52,059 --> 03:00:57,579
inhaling some dust. There's something going on here that they're not telling us. There are too

569
03:00:57,579 --> 03:01:04,629
many secrets. I've started coughing, too. I should sleep. Nothing's really wrong with me. I threw up

570
03:01:04,629 --> 03:01:09,780
blood three more times today, and I'm so weak I can barely move. Shit. I never should have come

571
03:01:09,780 --> 03:01:15,219
down here. I came for the money, but instead I'm the one paying the price. I'm a terrible father.

572
03:01:15,379 --> 03:01:23,590
I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You deserve better. Since morning my- Since morning head don't work.

573
03:01:23,590 --> 03:01:30,139
Why? More blood threw up. Many insects crawling. I hear a voice. This is what I'm talking about.

574
03:01:30,139 --> 03:01:36,489
This is what I wanted. New day. A fine day to work. Digging brings me so much joy. I am full

575
03:01:36,489 --> 03:01:42,780
of happiness. I offer it all to you. Everything for you. Do you know what I mean? This is the caveman

576
03:01:42,780 --> 03:01:47,860
kind of talk that I was looking for. The- Since morning head don't work. Okay, you're having-

577
03:01:48,020 --> 03:01:52,180
Something went wrong. Yeah, your head hurts. Why? You threw up blood. I puked. There's insects

578
03:01:52,180 --> 03:02:00,620
everywhere, and I hear things. We don't need all this. You know what I mean? Me like small word.

579
03:02:09,639 --> 03:02:21,459
Ooh. There's only one. It's limitless, though. Should I just piss off every single person here

580
03:02:21,459 --> 03:02:25,700
and just save for this and just get 50 rounds in this shotgun and that's how I end the playthrough

581
03:02:25,700 --> 03:02:33,479
is just have 50 bullets in the shotgun at the last boss. That's so stupid.

582
03:02:39,719 --> 03:02:45,799
It's 60,000 and that ticket. And I'll have 48 shots in this gun.

583
03:02:50,489 --> 03:02:56,569
Why not? It's stupid and fun. I might as well try it. It's 60,000. Oh, or the ticket.

584
03:02:57,450 --> 03:03:08,250
Oh, I thought it was needed both. I can make that happen. Look at that. 30,000.

585
03:03:11,049 --> 03:03:17,510
So if you kill that, um, that boss, you get 30k. That's pretty cool. Nice.

586
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:26,340
Ooh, I can make bullets.

587
03:03:36,620 --> 03:04:03,829
Grenades. Nah, I'm a flashbang kind of guy. These are close, although I should probably

588
03:04:03,829 --> 03:04:16,549
save it for here. What's the five, right? Five colors. So I would need to do green, purple,

589
03:04:18,870 --> 03:04:37,479
red. Okay. So take these out. I want another 100k. Green, purple. I need a purple. And then I could

590
03:04:37,479 --> 03:04:53,989
do blue. Yellow. I see a purple. We get another 100k. Be on the lookout for purple gem as I need

591
03:04:53,989 --> 03:05:12,569
one. All right. In the meantime, I think I'm going to save the money, although I might as well just

592
03:05:12,569 --> 03:05:16,409
keep one of the, I've been using this a lot more frequently. Have you noticed that? I think I'm

593
03:05:16,409 --> 03:05:38,329
going to use that. I've been using this a lot. Starting to see why this thing is really great.

594
03:05:44,409 --> 03:05:54,520
Is it worth 27,000? I could always sell it in the end. This could be the difference. This thing

595
03:05:54,520 --> 03:05:58,040
already has saved me at least two or three times with me being able to shoot and not worry about

596
03:05:58,040 --> 03:06:47,290
ammo. So I think it's all right. Oh no. Let's go. I already have enough. Ooh, okay. Nice red nine

597
03:06:47,290 --> 03:07:21,850
and then two handgun only. Try it out. I need to check. We got to check. I need to check this

598
03:07:21,850 --> 03:07:42,940
shit. They hide in the barrels sometimes with the skulls. I wonder if they're in the barrels.

599
03:07:42,940 --> 03:08:29,540
How many are there actually? Oh no, there are no hidden ones. Okay. Come on, dude. You fucked it

600
03:08:29,540 --> 03:09:14,440
up. That's it. No bonus round. Was it not fast enough? Wait for the fucking grenade guy.

601
03:10:03,940 --> 03:10:12,299
Where's the, that's all I fucking care about. Okay. Good. All right. I don't care about anything

602
03:10:12,299 --> 03:10:24,340
else. I don't care. I wanted the gold coin. There it is. We're good. Want the S and we want 100%.

603
03:10:24,340 --> 03:10:29,719
I need those gold coins. All right. I'm not sure. Is this the one that shoots?

604
03:10:33,290 --> 03:10:37,860
Whoa. What the hell? Wait, that's confusing. This thing shoots through people.

605
03:10:38,500 --> 03:11:14,170
You looking greasy? You don't think I know that? You don't think I, you don't think I'll be the

606
03:11:14,170 --> 03:11:30,250
first person to tell me that I'm a greasy motherfucker? Fuck. I got to wait a long,

607
03:11:30,250 --> 03:11:41,579
a lot longer than that. I got to wait longer. It's about piercing eight. There are eight of those.

608
03:11:41,579 --> 03:12:20,229
Holy shit. I don't think I'm doing that. Come on, man. Come on, man. What are you talking about?

609
03:12:20,229 --> 03:13:01,819
Right there. Wait for, you got to wait for four. You got, I got to wait a long time on this one

610
03:13:01,819 --> 03:13:07,579
when they line up. Ready? Right there. I mean, that's, that's how you do it.

611
03:13:09,319 --> 03:13:15,959
Kraken. Kraken. I was just gonna say Kraken. Your feet aren't glued to the floor.

612
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:25,959
I have, thanks Kraken. Welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid. Playing Resident Evil 5. It's four.

613
03:13:25,959 --> 03:13:54,100
I say, why do I keep saying five? But welcome everybody. I didn't wait again. I don't like this

614
03:13:54,100 --> 03:14:01,770
one. I'm not a fan. I don't like this one. I have to wait too long. I hate waiting. I hate waiting.

615
03:14:01,770 --> 03:14:27,059
I hate this one. Shoot. Give me the, I hate shoot. I hate waiting. I hate waiting. I hate this one.

616
03:14:27,059 --> 03:14:55,909
This is the machine gun one. Throw them away. No. Fucking can't. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.

617
03:15:14,219 --> 03:15:37,219
Get out of the fucking way. How do I get to the bonus round? Destroy all pirates

618
03:15:37,219 --> 03:16:58,120
in 10 shots or less. Oh, that sucks. One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh no. I didn't get them all.

619
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:15,209
Which one did I miss? Shit. I wonder which one I missed. I didn't see it. I'm one of the pirates.

620
03:17:15,209 --> 03:17:26,549
Wait, restart it. What's the condition on this one? 10 shots or less. Okay. Let's try it.

621
03:17:49,530 --> 03:18:10,979
Three, four, five. Oh, come on, dude. You got to be shitting me. That was bait. No, what are you

622
03:18:10,979 --> 03:18:28,440
doing? Now I'm just shooting. I fucking hate these. I'm going to eat my fucking microphone.

623
03:19:09,020 --> 03:19:19,079
How do I do that one? I guess it's bait. All right. So some of these are bait.

624
03:19:31,379 --> 03:19:54,549
Fuck. That's three, right? Four, five. What are you talking about, video game? Are you on fucking

625
03:19:54,549 --> 03:20:46,299
crack? I shot it directly in the face. Did it hit the ceiling? Perfect. Perfect. Put your head down.

626
03:20:46,299 --> 03:21:13,979
Put your head down. Get down. That's it, right? I got to have gotten it right there. That's eight,

627
03:21:13,979 --> 03:21:45,590
right? Yeah. Let's try this one more time. What the fuck? How did it hit the guy? It was the

628
03:21:45,590 --> 03:23:02,299
fucking triangle. Fuck. Just wait till they come over here. And that would have been 100%. It would

629
03:23:02,299 --> 03:23:40,969
have been every single fucking one. I'm done. Two, one. Or should I just go three? That's actually

630
03:23:40,969 --> 03:24:10,549
kind of good. I would have loved that earlier. Nothing kind of sucks. Another rare. 30% off body

631
03:24:10,549 --> 03:24:15,829
repairs. That's really good. But is it actually 30% or is it full of shit? The other one was bad.

632
03:24:15,829 --> 03:24:27,959
Dude, Ashley is dying and you're buying gumballs. I mean, I got to relax a little.

633
03:24:30,760 --> 03:24:54,069
Rare. 100% recovery item. Resale value. Like if I herbs and stuff, why would I sell herbs?

634
03:24:54,069 --> 03:25:06,659
Looks cool though. Feels cool. Nice. That's it, right? I forgot. He scared the shit out of me. I

635
03:25:06,659 --> 03:25:11,459
forgot he was here. I just saw a guy with a gun walking towards me and I was like, what is happening

636
03:25:11,459 --> 03:25:22,329
right now? I love the shooting range. I love it. I don't like that other gun though. Green, red,

637
03:25:22,329 --> 03:25:35,579
yellow herb combo sells for 20,000 with that trinket. What do you mean? Hold on. Where's the

638
03:25:35,579 --> 03:26:15,370
typewriter? Let's take a look. All right. Let's, I'm curious. Got a selection of good things on

639
03:26:15,370 --> 03:26:31,110
sale, stranger. I'll buy almost anything. So this is normally 2,000. All right. Let me take it off

640
03:26:31,110 --> 03:26:40,780
and see what it does. Uh, I think I, yeah, the gunpowder one's, I think the one I want.

641
03:26:41,940 --> 03:27:00,260
Melee. All right. Get this off. I'll keep the shotgun one on. I'll just keep the chicken one on,

642
03:27:00,819 --> 03:27:03,940
maybe. Yeah, just keep this. If I run into an egg, I run into an egg.

643
03:27:04,500 --> 03:27:13,260
Beetle, chicken, fish. Yeah, but there's no reason to keep, have this on right now if I'm

644
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:31,909
not going to be near the merchant. So now let's see. What does that sell for now? Yeah. So that's

645
03:27:31,909 --> 03:27:49,829
pretty cool. I think I'm good to go. Okay. Very, very fun. Very cool. What an exciting experience.

646
03:27:49,829 --> 03:28:01,940
Let's go. My faith in someone who used to work for Umbrella. So you heard, huh? Umbrella's done

647
03:28:01,940 --> 03:28:09,290
for. You don't need to worry about them anymore. You didn't answer my question. What are you after?

648
03:28:09,290 --> 03:28:16,329
I just want to feel good about myself, make amends or something like that. Ooh, stuff.

649
03:28:19,370 --> 03:28:37,000
Oh yeah, this is a mine shaft. Don't you actually ride a mine cart? I definitely shouldn't use this

650
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:49,100
then. I'll lose all the bolts. What are we doing on crafting? Can I craft anything? If I'm going to

651
03:28:49,100 --> 03:28:59,930
use it, I'm going to use it. Seeing the light on this one. Dynamite has been relocated to the M4

652
03:28:59,930 --> 03:29:21,850
store room. When using explosive, cave-ins are a frequent occurrence. Watch out. That's going to

653
03:29:21,850 --> 03:29:34,379
be a fun puzzle. Looking forward to it. Crossbow's been carrying these last few chapters. It actually

654
03:29:34,379 --> 03:29:52,489
kind of has. I've talked a lot of shit about it. Oh, we're going over. This looks really,

655
03:29:52,489 --> 03:30:01,739
really nice down here. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Time for this thing to shine. Are you ready?

656
03:30:03,049 --> 03:30:08,020
This is where this shines. Come on over here. Run over here. Do what you want to do. Watch this.

657
03:30:08,979 --> 03:30:27,639
Hello. It just clocked me in the head with the shovel. I would be out before I...

658
03:30:35,879 --> 03:30:53,270
What up? What's up now, huh? Ow. Stop. How many fucking bombs do you guys have?

659
03:30:54,229 --> 03:31:43,500
Put that down. Put it down. Put it down. Oh, she's just punching. What the fuck are you doing?

660
03:32:06,579 --> 03:32:32,379
I got to press a button or something, right? All right. Where's... There's got to be a lever

661
03:32:32,379 --> 03:33:05,590
or something. Another chainsaw? Why would you knock her out of that? The shotgun is

662
03:33:05,590 --> 03:33:22,979
fucking stacked. Stacked. All right. This way. Do we have to do, you know, throw them up there?

663
03:33:23,540 --> 03:34:31,110
Here we go. What's just happened? Edgar Allen. Oh, looking fast. Shit. Broken. Dynamite.

664
03:34:41,979 --> 03:34:56,790
He just... Sorry. Dynamite. All right. Let's go walk around. Jeremy, can you pause the stream?

665
03:34:56,790 --> 03:35:13,370
I got to go to bed. Um, is it good now? Okay. Time to walk around and make sure I didn't

666
03:35:13,370 --> 03:35:29,370
miss anything, which there's a bunch of shit. Yep. Very cool. Just screenshot the stream.

667
03:35:29,930 --> 03:35:49,059
All right. There are actually a couple of few things I missed. There. Okay. There's one over

668
03:35:49,059 --> 03:36:17,860
this way. Herb. Yep. There's my bolts back. I hear one of those things. Where is it? The other

669
03:36:17,860 --> 03:36:45,860
treasure is up there. All right. Let's get out of here. Just a legendary loot. Oh, I think I got

670
03:36:45,860 --> 03:37:19,670
everything. I have to go around and drop down. All right. Seen like an hour when they finished

671
03:37:19,670 --> 03:37:46,069
this. That's not a puzzle. That's not a puzzle. Jesus. Oh, I didn't know it was going to roll

672
03:37:46,069 --> 03:38:07,209
all the way. I thought it was going to cave in. Wait a minute. Why did it take arrows from me?

673
03:38:07,209 --> 03:38:15,530
I had 12 before. Okay. I just almost freaked out. I was going to say I don't have to do the whole

674
03:38:15,530 --> 03:38:28,500
thing over. Right. Okay. There we go. I got to get all the stuff again. This one and it's hanging

675
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:46,950
up here. That one. And there's one across there that way. Wait, is it? No, it's in that little

676
03:38:46,950 --> 03:39:05,829
quarter. It's my favorite tea. I really like green tea. Oh, no, I already did this. I like green. I

677
03:39:05,829 --> 03:39:29,500
like, um, I like white tea. Okay, let's go. I should black tea kind of has a very distinct

678
03:39:29,500 --> 03:39:34,790
kind of bitter flavor that I don't really love. I love it when it's here's the thing. I know a

679
03:39:34,790 --> 03:39:39,219
lot of you probably are going to agree with this and we're just going to talk about it for a second.

680
03:39:39,219 --> 03:39:46,729
If I make, if I brew black tea and I put sugar in it or I sweetened it somehow, I don't even,

681
03:39:46,729 --> 03:39:52,250
it doesn't, it's so it's different than if you were to buy an iced tea from the store and drink

682
03:39:52,250 --> 03:39:59,670
it in just a sweetened iced tea. It tastes way better to me and I can never figure out why.

683
03:39:59,670 --> 03:40:05,030
Brewing black tea and putting sugar in it still tastes kind of bitter with sugary sweetness flavor,

684
03:40:05,030 --> 03:40:09,290
but getting an iced tea like a brisk or like a Lipton iced tea or something. They don't,

685
03:40:09,290 --> 03:40:21,780
it tastes different. Is it just more sugar and just more lemon? I, green tea is my favorite

686
03:40:21,780 --> 03:40:43,799
though for sure. I love green tea. You handle yourself pretty well. You sure you're just a

687
03:40:43,799 --> 03:41:01,020
researcher? I'm just an average guy who... Give me the heal. I was like, where's my bass? I ate

688
03:41:01,020 --> 03:41:05,899
that two hours ago. Did I tell you guys it just kind of reminded me? I was like, where is it? I

689
03:41:05,899 --> 03:41:11,340
didn't, where's my bass? I want it. I was, what happened to my bass? Just unlocked a memory when

690
03:41:11,340 --> 03:41:22,379
I was younger. I want to say when I was like, maybe like late teens, I want to say. I remember

691
03:41:22,379 --> 03:41:27,100
I scratched a scratch ticket and one, I won a couple hundred dollars on a scratch ticket

692
03:41:27,659 --> 03:41:33,190
when I was like, I don't know, maybe it had to have been like 19 or something. And I was like,

693
03:41:33,190 --> 03:41:40,309
holy shit dude, fucking 300 bucks. And I kept looking for that money for like a year and later.

694
03:41:40,309 --> 03:41:43,750
I was like, no, wait, I got money. Cause I, I won that scratch, I scratched off that fucking

695
03:41:43,750 --> 03:41:52,299
300 bucks. I got money. And it was like, no, you don't, you don't. It's been spent. It was spent.

696
03:41:52,299 --> 03:42:04,069
It's been like two years, dude. You didn't, the money's not there anymore. You spent it all on

697
03:42:04,069 --> 03:42:34,250
Diablo too. I wasn't even looking and it scared me. I was reading chat. Oh shit. I forgot about

698
03:42:34,250 --> 03:42:41,159
this. This is going to be awful. I forget this is, there's a strategy here. This is an unfair tag

699
03:42:41,159 --> 03:43:46,600
team. I just, I'm dead, dude. I'm running around looting the fucking area. I get stomped. Pay

700
03:43:46,600 --> 03:43:57,059
attention, dude. I get my head bitten off. Oh yeah. I have to do that because I just, I'll forget to

701
03:43:57,059 --> 03:44:22,459
pick up this stuff. Let's go. What? Oh, dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Get

702
03:44:22,459 --> 03:45:14,729
them to chase. Get them to chase. Over here. Get over here. Come over here. Luis, get him over,

703
03:45:14,729 --> 03:46:25,700
come over this. What are you doing? Why does he keep moving? Oh, fuck you.

704
03:46:38,040 --> 03:47:09,670
Luis, out of the way. All right, there's one. This one. Get, get off. Where you going? Where is he?

705
03:47:09,670 --> 03:48:12,139
Where'd he go? That's a lot of dynamite, man. What do you want? Shoot it. Whoa. No, get off. Get off.

706
03:48:12,139 --> 03:48:22,979
Get off. Get off. Get off. What am I doing? Shit. I was supposed to drop them. I, it was a stupid

707
03:48:22,979 --> 03:48:38,870
indicator popped up on the screen. No, stop shooting him. Stop shooting him. Let him get

708
03:48:38,870 --> 03:49:02,940
into the, stop shooting him. Let him get into the middle. No, he's getting out again. Stop shooting.

709
03:49:02,940 --> 03:49:51,059
Stop shooting. Rip items. Rip items. I don't, I don't get anything for, well, here's the argument

710
03:49:51,059 --> 03:50:00,920
I'm going to make to you. I probably would have gone through a bunch of this ammo, right? So,

711
03:50:00,920 --> 03:50:16,969
technically I saved ammo, but I didn't get like 20, $30,000. Oh, well, it's all right. I actually

712
03:50:16,969 --> 03:51:00,280
have a ton of ammo now. Is that everything? That's everything. That's fun. They only drop rubies.

713
03:51:01,000 --> 03:51:08,489
That's kind of sad because I think I need a ruby. Purple gem. An amethyst doesn't drop from either

714
03:51:08,489 --> 03:51:19,819
one of those two, right? Cause that would actually be bad. I would actually restart for that. It's

715
03:51:19,819 --> 03:51:23,110
random.

716
03:51:42,069 --> 03:52:18,860
Saying that sentence winded him. You just fought two giants. Yeah, an hour ago. Time moves much

717
03:52:18,860 --> 03:52:24,059
differently in this game. I think we're, we're here for like six or seven days, aren't we? And

718
03:52:24,139 --> 03:52:34,180
it's just kind of at each chapter is like another day. I'm making all of that up. You're not

719
03:52:34,180 --> 03:53:10,920
suggesting we ride this thing. He hasn't pissed one time. Oh, you don't know that need a yellow herb.

720
03:53:10,920 --> 03:53:32,579
Very bad. Let's go. Give us a push. What were you calling something on this? It's moving.

721
03:53:33,219 --> 03:53:38,020
This should speed things up a bit. I can't believe I'm doing this. Hey, we're in a hurry, right?

722
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:56,059
By the way, what now? That was a little drop. Wasn't even scary. Oh, you have to lean.

723
03:53:57,190 --> 03:54:34,809
Why is it going to flip? Why are we going so far off the rails? Dude, dude, shot the gun out of his

724
03:54:34,809 --> 03:56:00,459
hand. Jesus, I'm on it. What was that guy doing? Why are we going so slow? Got it.

725
03:56:07,620 --> 03:57:12,100
That was fun. That was pretty sick. Hold on. I hear like a, Whoa, watch this. Don't ever hold

726
03:57:12,100 --> 03:57:16,100
your hand out like that. You should have, you should have been behind your back or something,

727
03:57:16,100 --> 03:57:49,899
man. Eggs in here. Is that it? There's something else over here. Besides this,

728
03:57:49,899 --> 03:58:01,780
there's something else, right? No, that way. Can I climb that? No. Very cool. I got all my

729
03:58:01,780 --> 03:58:28,709
arrows back. All right. Cart ride part two. Play Donkey Kong music actually would be kind of funny.

730
03:58:28,709 --> 03:58:49,579
I can't really all tap right now though. Do they die from that? Or is it? I don't know.

731
03:58:49,579 --> 03:59:32,739
I just want to see. They really just throw you right in, huh? What the fuck? Are you shitting me?

732
03:59:39,899 --> 03:59:42,860
I feel like that's another player playing Mario Kart or something.

733
04:00:24,870 --> 04:01:01,620
Fuck. What's wrong with Luke? What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him?

734
04:01:01,620 --> 04:02:08,389
Why is he just lifeless right now? We're good. That didn't work.

735
04:02:08,469 --> 04:02:33,850
Kitchen Nightmares sounds, it really kind of works. Kitchen Nightmares.

736
04:02:37,459 --> 04:03:00,489
That's so stupid. Wait a minute. There is a jewel over there. How do I get over there?

737
04:03:02,579 --> 04:03:12,760
How do I get over there? Shit. Did I miss it? Maybe from here? Oh well. Maybe it's under me.

738
04:03:12,760 --> 04:03:42,950
Shit. Did I miss it? Maybe from here? Oh well. Maybe it's under me.

739
04:03:45,290 --> 04:04:05,319
I didn't even see it. I missed. You know what? It's the sound effect for me. It's just the loud

740
04:04:05,319 --> 04:04:14,600
sound. Unexpected loud sound effects. Maybe I can get it. Wait a minute. What's down here?

741
04:04:14,600 --> 04:04:50,139
I definitely can get it from here. That's what I'm looking for. Destroy all the entrances to the

742
04:04:50,139 --> 04:04:57,579
hive. Too many have lost their lives in the never-ending swarm of insects. It's a plague.

743
04:04:57,579 --> 04:05:30,420
Destroy the entrances to their gigantic hive. You got it. All right. Entrances. That's an entrance

744
04:05:30,420 --> 04:05:47,610
right there. Is it not? Oh my god. No. Wait. Is it? That's it. Yeah, it is. That's it. Am I wasting

745
04:05:47,610 --> 04:06:52,149
ammo right now? Get more. Oh, sapphire. All right. Do we need to jump up this? Can we not jump up

746
04:06:52,149 --> 04:07:09,290
this together? Are you kidding me? What the duck is that? I don't know. Good question.

747
04:07:20,819 --> 04:07:59,219
What? That's gone now, dude. All right. There's only one more right here. Hooray. Mission

748
04:07:59,219 --> 04:08:09,379
accomplished. What happened to Ashley? It's a very, very good question. She was taken and then

749
04:08:10,899 --> 04:08:15,159
I kind of lost track after I started doing the gumball machine over and over again.

750
04:08:15,239 --> 04:08:44,579
But we'll be good. There is that over there. There's a gem or jewel over there somewhere.

751
04:08:45,219 --> 04:08:57,299
That was not very good. I could do that better. There's all kinds of gems, jewels. That one's

752
04:08:57,299 --> 04:09:17,879
better. Use that one. That's a weird place for that. I don't know why it's here. Maybe I have

753
04:09:17,879 --> 04:09:34,379
to run back with a bunch of things attacking me. Yes. Can I destroy the hive? Why am I still getting

754
04:09:34,379 --> 04:10:17,479
attacked? Oh, it's in here. Oh, you're welcome. Got a selection of good things on sale. I could

755
04:10:17,479 --> 04:10:33,770
buy a bunch of these. I have learned how many sapphires I have. Holy shit. I'll do two blue

756
04:10:33,770 --> 04:10:53,180
with the one green in here. Change clothes. I will in like six or seven days.

757
04:10:59,430 --> 04:11:11,700
Your fools won't do you much good in the gray. Stranger, I'll pay a pretty penny for that.

758
04:11:11,700 --> 04:11:21,700
Your weapons are in good hands, mate. I'll see you right. It doesn't get any better than that.

759
04:11:21,700 --> 04:11:27,459
It's a veritable work of art, mate. Will that come back any time?

760
04:11:28,340 --> 04:11:44,549
Now the quest to make a shitload of shotgun ammo begins. Okay, I want to make sure I have my

761
04:11:44,549 --> 04:12:16,299
shotgun thing on. Gunpowder is the case that I have on. Go for it. Come on. Come on. 21. The quest

762
04:12:16,299 --> 04:13:00,899
to get this to 50. Don't get yourself killed now. What can I interest you in?

763
04:13:03,770 --> 04:13:08,489
Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. Pleasure doing business with you.

764
04:13:09,770 --> 04:13:25,219
Come back any time. You're wearing a Zoolander outfit. Dude, just wait until I put

765
04:13:26,860 --> 04:13:33,670
48 rounds in this thing. I'm going to shoot 50 times in a row at the last boss and it's going

766
04:13:33,670 --> 04:13:47,209
to be fucking hilarious. I'm going for the comedy run at this point. Let me kill this. Can I not

767
04:13:47,209 --> 04:14:25,159
get up there? I don't think I can do it. Oh well. Oh well. Aren't you cheating at this game? I turn

768
04:14:25,159 --> 04:14:34,780
unlimited ammo on when I have trouble. It's like half the game. Unlimited ammo invincibility

769
04:14:34,940 --> 04:15:10,309
is turned on every few minutes or so. How'd he get the outfit? I paid an extra $10.

770
04:15:23,290 --> 04:15:28,649
We made it all this way. You know it means we're almost... Almost what?

771
04:15:34,409 --> 04:15:50,200
Luis! Long time no see, rookie. Major Krauser? What the hell? Why? Recovering stolen goods

772
04:15:52,729 --> 04:16:03,930
and killing a few rats along the way. Easy work. Ashley, it was you. Catch on quick.

773
04:16:05,559 --> 04:16:09,319
Didn't I teach you? Knives are faster.

774
04:16:11,639 --> 04:16:15,559
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Oh yeah. You fast enough for that?

775
04:16:43,459 --> 04:16:51,290
We are just getting started, rookie. Are you being controlled by that cult?

776
04:16:52,489 --> 04:16:56,489
This has nothing to do with them. I'm a free man who made a choice.

777
04:16:56,489 --> 04:17:19,319
Ow. Getting parried. Oh, you got parried five times in a row, man.

778
04:17:51,690 --> 04:17:52,969
This is a fun fight with a parry.

779
04:18:24,729 --> 04:18:29,819
Good day, my friend. And such a loss to the ladies of the world.

780
04:18:31,860 --> 04:18:42,549
Don't talk. Take this. The key to my laboratory. Go there and remove those damn parasites.

781
04:18:50,020 --> 04:19:01,940
No. I got it for you. I go, smoking is bad for you. Don't smoke. I don't do it.

782
04:19:01,940 --> 04:19:14,620
I lead a pretty shitty life. But now, hey, what do you think Leon can change, right?

783
04:19:32,629 --> 04:19:50,709
Shit. Crazy. A lot of points. Oh, the exclusive upgrade, right? Ooh,

784
04:19:50,709 --> 04:19:58,389
parry all of Jack Prowzer's five consecutive attacks. That's pretty good, too.

785
04:19:59,030 --> 04:20:08,329
I was wondering. I felt like I got those off pretty well.

786
04:20:23,190 --> 04:23:41,659
I gotta pee again. I'll be right back. I'm back. Do you guys like that I do that now?

787
04:23:43,129 --> 04:23:47,799
I give the little... That's not so crazy.

788
04:23:47,799 --> 04:23:53,989
I like somebody said he saw the cigarette and needed to have a smoke break.

789
04:23:53,989 --> 04:23:59,239
No, I just really had to pee. I drank a lot of water. Trying to stay hydrated.

790
04:23:59,239 --> 04:24:20,569
Well, not a lot. That's not necessarily true.

791
04:24:20,569 --> 04:24:22,969
You don't have to hide it. We know you want to cry.

792
04:24:28,469 --> 04:24:42,309
What do you mean cry? Oh, because of... Oh, I see what you said.

793
04:24:42,309 --> 04:25:11,639
Costume change? Yeah, I'll put here on. I just saved her, right? Give me a sec.

794
04:25:11,639 --> 04:25:18,659
Well, might as well just try them all.

795
04:25:18,659 --> 04:25:32,809
We haven't seen Ashley yet, so just make it normal. We had to see all the costumes.

796
04:25:32,809 --> 04:25:38,340
Oh, hold on. You can't see. We gotta see them all.

797
04:25:38,340 --> 04:25:55,420
It's not like we're not gonna do this. After we play this for like a chapter, I'll take it off.

798
04:25:55,420 --> 04:26:00,979
We'll go back to the... Actually, I like this one. This one's actually good.

799
04:26:00,979 --> 04:26:04,500
They're all good for different reasons. They're all fun.

800
04:26:04,500 --> 04:26:14,059
All right, let's go. Sunglasses are going to be taken off.

801
04:26:14,059 --> 04:26:41,899
I know. Shocking. No sound. Oh, shit. There you go.

802
04:26:41,899 --> 04:26:58,979
Don't get away with this, Krauser. Geez. I feel like I should have a sword.

803
04:26:58,979 --> 04:27:06,120
There's lots of... Actually, there... I gotta loot this whole area. This whole place.

804
04:27:13,059 --> 04:27:24,540
There's one other herb over here, right? Okay.

805
04:27:24,540 --> 04:27:28,790
You're a rogue with a crossbow and daggers. Actually, kind of true.

806
04:27:28,790 --> 04:27:32,200
I do have a crossbow. That's right. I am playing the part.

807
04:27:47,079 --> 04:27:50,100
Knight with a shotgun and a cell phone.

808
04:27:50,100 --> 04:27:52,739
Leon, there's only time to say this once, so listen up.

809
04:27:52,739 --> 04:27:58,969
They took your friend to... If you hurry, you might get there before she turns...

810
04:27:58,969 --> 04:28:02,889
So you aren't heartless after all. I guess I should be thankful.

811
04:28:04,149 --> 04:28:17,719
Turn on some fantasy music. What's jarring?

812
04:28:17,719 --> 04:28:23,819
Someone helped me recover a stolen jewel snatched by a thieving crow.

813
04:28:24,459 --> 04:28:30,729
I bet it can be found in the vile thing's nest. It's an heirloom. Okay.

814
04:28:37,270 --> 04:28:39,829
Even the very sight of his image makes my skin crawl.

815
04:28:39,829 --> 04:28:43,030
Do me a service and find some way to deface the portrait of him

816
04:28:43,590 --> 04:28:46,069
in the room shown in the photograph, will you?

817
04:28:46,069 --> 04:28:49,959
I'm not particular about how you do it. Hitting it with something might do the trick.

818
04:28:49,959 --> 04:29:06,489
Where is that? Throne room?

819
04:29:06,809 --> 04:29:25,190
That's your eye.

820
04:29:25,190 --> 04:29:29,799
Leon looks like he's got lost on his way to a renaissance fair.

821
04:29:29,799 --> 04:29:33,559
Welcome. Where would it? What can I do you for?

822
04:29:33,559 --> 04:29:35,110
Still can't do anything.

823
04:29:35,110 --> 04:29:37,590
Hmph. Suit yourself, stranger.

824
04:29:37,590 --> 04:29:43,530
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Did I get everything over there?

825
04:29:44,329 --> 04:29:46,489
Is there... Did I get everything over there?

826
04:29:47,049 --> 04:29:52,500
There's the clock tower. Hang in there.

827
04:29:52,500 --> 04:30:05,159
Shit. I'm going back. I look pissed.

828
04:30:05,799 --> 04:30:24,100
Sorry, Ashley. There's items.

829
04:30:31,860 --> 04:30:33,139
Okay. That was worth it.

830
04:30:33,780 --> 04:30:38,340
You know what I kind of want to do?

831
04:30:41,020 --> 04:30:49,030
Do you remember all the way back, like the very beginning of the game,

832
04:30:49,030 --> 04:30:51,270
where the... Where's the village?

833
04:30:51,270 --> 04:30:52,950
The actual village, village.

834
04:30:52,950 --> 04:31:01,659
I'm kind of very far away from it, aren't I?

835
04:31:01,659 --> 04:31:04,219
There's a couple of locked... It's gone.

836
04:31:04,219 --> 04:31:08,659
Has it gone forever? It's locked off? Shit.

837
04:31:08,659 --> 04:31:10,739
Because there's a couple of locked drawers

838
04:31:13,940 --> 04:31:16,920
that are in the very beginning of the game.

839
04:31:16,920 --> 04:31:19,319
And I was saying, oh, maybe I want to go back and get those.

840
04:31:19,959 --> 04:31:24,709
There are locked drawers back in the beginning.

841
04:31:25,350 --> 04:31:27,590
They probably just have gold bars in them, I'm assuming.

842
04:31:39,989 --> 04:31:41,190
Check your drawers.

843
04:31:59,139 --> 04:32:16,809
Okay. A lot of treasure in here.

844
04:32:16,809 --> 04:32:18,969
All the side missions are back in the castle.

845
04:32:18,969 --> 04:32:49,370
The painting one seems very easy, so why not?

846
04:32:49,370 --> 04:32:53,270
Sorry, Ashley. I'm going... I'm going back again.

847
04:32:53,270 --> 04:32:57,290
Sorry, Ashley. I keep having second thoughts.

848
04:32:58,010 --> 04:33:02,809
I'll do the painting one. The night one is cool, too.

849
04:33:11,060 --> 04:33:12,580
Don't skip the cigarette minigame.

850
04:33:33,349 --> 04:33:35,349
Not down here. Oh, fuck. I was...

851
04:33:35,349 --> 04:33:36,470
I just was on autopilot.

852
04:33:39,450 --> 04:33:42,250
There's an achievement for riding back and forth?

853
04:33:48,919 --> 04:33:52,840
I am really very indecisive ever since I put this fucking costume on.

854
04:33:52,840 --> 04:34:07,880
All right. So where are these requests?

855
04:34:07,880 --> 04:34:14,900
Jewel thief. I already did that.

856
04:34:14,900 --> 04:34:18,569
Defeat the strong threat, the knight.

857
04:34:18,569 --> 04:34:33,500
Maybe I'll do the knight and then this one, too.

858
04:34:33,500 --> 04:34:36,869
I'll do the knight and I'll do the painting one.

859
04:34:36,869 --> 04:34:43,290
Jewel thief takes like two minutes.

860
04:34:43,290 --> 04:34:48,490
How come I rode down and immediately rode back up?

861
04:34:48,490 --> 04:34:51,770
Well, that's because I was confused and I was not supposed to go down.

862
04:34:52,409 --> 04:34:54,360
I was supposed to go that way.

863
04:34:55,159 --> 04:34:58,200
Throne room one is a minute, too.

864
04:35:01,580 --> 04:35:02,299
We go this way.

865
04:35:03,099 --> 04:35:07,419
Can you stop being confused?

866
04:35:10,740 --> 04:35:16,419
That's hard considering that's baked into my personality.

867
04:35:17,139 --> 04:35:21,619
And I don't think there's ever going to be a time when I can stop that.

868
04:35:21,619 --> 04:35:24,889
It's kind of who I am at this point.

869
04:35:24,889 --> 04:35:26,650
So I think I have accepted that.

870
04:35:30,540 --> 04:35:31,419
Understandable. Yeah.

871
04:35:36,650 --> 04:35:38,009
All right. Where's the throne room?

872
04:35:40,759 --> 04:35:42,599
Courtyard, wine cellar.

873
04:35:42,599 --> 04:35:46,040
There's a lot of stuff here.

874
04:35:46,040 --> 04:35:48,439
Oh, yeah. I mean, this is all going to get locked off.

875
04:35:48,439 --> 04:35:49,799
So might as well just do a little bit.

876
04:35:49,799 --> 04:35:57,509
I have keys, treasury.

877
04:35:58,069 --> 04:36:05,110
So what's faster, taking the train back and going this way or just walking from here?

878
04:36:05,110 --> 04:36:22,779
All right. Looking for locked drawers.

879
04:36:23,500 --> 04:36:27,939
I know there's one or two over here.

880
04:36:27,939 --> 04:36:36,389
Okay. It's the grand hall.

881
04:36:36,950 --> 04:36:42,779
How did I not open this?

882
04:36:51,110 --> 04:36:54,150
All right. Courtyard is this one in the courtyard.

883
04:36:54,150 --> 04:37:03,290
Someone help me recover stolen jewel by thieving crow.

884
04:37:03,290 --> 04:37:04,729
There's a nest in the courtyard.

885
04:37:06,459 --> 04:37:07,979
I'm going to go to the courtyard first.

886
04:37:21,400 --> 04:37:24,759
Got it. Is that right?

887
04:37:25,080 --> 04:37:26,040
I just saw a huge bird.

888
04:37:26,680 --> 04:37:41,270
All right. Nest.

889
04:37:41,270 --> 04:37:43,990
There's apparently a nest here.

890
04:37:43,990 --> 04:37:52,939
Bro, get away from me. What?

891
04:37:52,939 --> 04:37:59,130
Oh, there it is.

892
04:38:05,750 --> 04:38:12,200
All right. Scratched emerald.

893
04:38:12,200 --> 04:38:12,919
That's that one.

894
04:38:14,099 --> 04:38:15,380
The knight is in the mausoleum.

895
04:38:21,430 --> 04:38:22,389
I failed that one.

896
04:38:22,389 --> 04:38:25,459
All right. So this one, where is this one?

897
04:38:25,459 --> 04:38:27,939
So mausoleum and then this weird throne room.

898
04:38:27,939 --> 04:38:32,069
Audience chamber.

899
04:38:37,990 --> 04:38:39,189
Audience chamber, right?

900
04:38:39,189 --> 04:38:53,110
Ooh, far right.

901
04:38:53,110 --> 04:38:59,020
It's over here.

902
04:38:59,020 --> 04:39:01,130
Hold on. I'm curious about this.

903
04:39:01,130 --> 04:39:05,130
A lot of shit over here.

904
04:39:05,130 --> 04:39:10,419
Yeah, there's a lot of shit over here.

905
04:39:10,419 --> 04:39:46,630
Okay. I want to check. I got to check.

906
04:39:46,630 --> 04:39:49,349
This way is open now.

907
04:39:49,349 --> 04:39:50,229
No, I need to.

908
04:39:50,869 --> 04:40:04,259
No, there's a bunch of shit in here.

909
04:40:04,259 --> 04:40:05,750
Let's go ahead and get it.

910
04:40:05,750 --> 04:40:14,259
100k. 100,000.

911
04:40:14,259 --> 04:41:00,759
It's already worth coming back here for the 100k.

912
04:41:00,759 --> 04:41:08,139
Whoa. All right.

913
04:41:11,110 --> 04:41:15,720
No, my bolt.

914
04:41:15,720 --> 04:41:19,540
Game is freaking legit.

915
04:41:19,540 --> 04:41:24,549
Yeah, it is.

916
04:41:24,549 --> 04:41:25,349
Nice.

917
04:41:25,349 --> 04:41:27,000
Extravagant clock.

918
04:41:27,000 --> 04:41:37,189
What else is in here?

919
04:41:37,189 --> 04:41:46,180
There it is. Nice.

920
04:41:46,180 --> 04:41:46,979
Big money coming up.

921
04:41:51,939 --> 04:41:54,099
The bolts are not real bolts.

922
04:41:54,099 --> 04:41:54,979
It's in the wall.

923
04:41:54,979 --> 04:41:56,259
Now down here.

924
04:41:56,259 --> 04:42:01,509
Ooh, all right.

925
04:42:01,509 --> 04:42:02,069
There's a bunch of...

926
04:42:02,069 --> 04:42:03,189
I'm just going to go through this.

927
04:42:03,189 --> 04:42:26,360
This game is busting.

928
04:42:26,360 --> 04:42:27,639
Nobody said that.

929
04:42:27,639 --> 04:42:28,200
Yeah, they did.

930
04:42:29,979 --> 04:42:30,700
Why would I...

931
04:42:30,700 --> 04:42:31,259
I just read it.

932
04:42:31,259 --> 04:42:32,060
Somebody said it.

933
04:42:32,060 --> 04:42:41,209
Is the knight down here?

934
04:42:41,209 --> 04:42:46,860
I'm going to run into the knight, aren't I?

935
04:43:18,970 --> 04:43:19,369
I'm good.

936
04:43:26,020 --> 04:43:33,939
Now from here, I could go this way.

937
04:43:33,939 --> 04:43:52,330
There's a treasure down here.

938
04:43:52,330 --> 04:43:54,540
Let me just see where it is.

939
04:43:54,540 --> 04:43:56,599
Is it up or down?

940
04:43:58,419 --> 04:43:59,459
Locked chest or something, maybe?

941
04:44:04,139 --> 04:44:15,540
All right.

942
04:44:15,540 --> 04:44:15,779
It's...

943
04:44:17,419 --> 04:44:20,860
He's totally baked doing side quests.

944
04:44:20,860 --> 04:44:21,419
Huh?

945
04:44:21,419 --> 04:44:49,909
Where's this treasure?

946
04:44:49,909 --> 04:44:54,779
I should never come down here.

947
04:44:54,779 --> 04:44:55,419
God damn it.

948
04:44:55,419 --> 04:44:55,659
All right.

949
04:44:55,659 --> 04:44:57,020
I need to go back or something

950
04:44:57,020 --> 04:44:58,459
because there's like a treasure here,

951
04:44:58,459 --> 04:45:13,580
but I'm just getting stuck.

952
04:45:13,580 --> 04:45:14,459
What was that?

953
04:45:14,459 --> 04:45:15,259
I shot you in the head.

954
04:45:15,900 --> 04:45:48,380
Where do I go?

955
04:45:57,479 --> 04:45:58,569
Okay.

956
04:45:58,569 --> 04:45:59,450
Is that it?

957
04:45:59,450 --> 04:46:02,229
I don't think so.

958
04:46:02,229 --> 04:46:23,000
Try to get a suplex.

959
04:46:31,110 --> 04:46:32,779
Got it.

960
04:46:32,779 --> 04:46:37,029
Finally.

961
04:46:37,029 --> 04:46:37,909
Get out of the way.

962
04:46:46,619 --> 04:46:48,380
It's up on...

963
04:46:49,669 --> 04:47:01,159
It's over here.

964
04:47:01,159 --> 04:47:02,500
And then up.

965
04:47:02,500 --> 04:47:07,540
What did that do?

966
04:47:44,630 --> 04:47:45,669
He can't aim.

967
04:47:45,669 --> 04:47:49,939
Yes, I can.

968
04:47:49,939 --> 04:47:50,419
Nice.

969
04:47:50,419 --> 04:47:51,779
Oh, it's worth it for sure.

970
04:48:07,189 --> 04:48:12,729
Absolutely worth it.

971
04:48:12,729 --> 04:48:13,959
Nice.

972
04:48:13,959 --> 04:48:14,599
I hear...

973
04:48:14,599 --> 04:48:15,240
Where is it?

974
04:48:15,240 --> 04:48:36,950
I don't think I'm going to get them all,

975
04:48:36,950 --> 04:48:45,720
but the germ of bussin'.

976
04:48:45,720 --> 04:48:47,049
All right.

977
04:48:47,049 --> 04:48:49,450
Now to make this...

978
04:48:51,540 --> 04:48:52,819
I think I'm just going to take it.

979
04:48:52,819 --> 04:48:55,099
I'm almost at max health.

980
04:48:55,099 --> 04:48:57,479
Stop saying that.

981
04:48:57,479 --> 04:49:01,939
I'm sorry.

982
04:49:01,939 --> 04:49:04,119
I'm sorry.

983
04:49:04,119 --> 04:49:09,689
I could probably take one more hit,

984
04:49:09,689 --> 04:49:10,569
so maybe not.

985
04:49:10,569 --> 04:49:12,009
All right.

986
04:49:12,009 --> 04:49:12,729
Now here's a good question.

987
04:49:12,729 --> 04:49:13,849
How do I get the hell out of here?

988
04:49:13,849 --> 04:49:14,409
And where do I need...

989
04:49:14,409 --> 04:49:15,610
What do I want to go from here?

990
04:49:15,610 --> 04:49:32,040
This way, right?

991
04:49:32,040 --> 04:49:39,580
Straight through here, right?

992
04:49:39,580 --> 04:49:40,220
Maybe.

993
04:49:40,220 --> 04:50:05,580
I haven't been this way.

994
04:50:05,580 --> 04:50:06,060
All right.

995
04:50:06,060 --> 04:50:06,939
Another treasure.

996
04:50:06,939 --> 04:50:14,259
Oh, there's a gunpowder.

997
04:50:14,259 --> 04:50:14,659
Nice.

998
04:50:14,659 --> 04:50:33,959
This is a windy out.

999
04:50:33,959 --> 04:50:35,720
What's going on here?

1000
04:50:35,720 --> 04:50:36,759
Is it windy?

1001
04:50:36,759 --> 04:50:48,979
This person has 100 million HP.

1002
04:51:07,220 --> 04:51:08,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1003
04:51:08,340 --> 04:51:09,459
I can't get that ammo back.

1004
04:51:09,459 --> 04:51:09,860
Why not?

1005
04:51:10,419 --> 04:51:19,340
Is that for real?

1006
04:51:19,340 --> 04:51:20,299
No, I can hit...

1007
04:51:20,299 --> 04:51:21,099
There's a thing, right?

1008
04:51:21,099 --> 04:51:22,490
I can shoot.

1009
04:51:22,490 --> 04:51:23,130
Usually there is.

1010
04:51:27,060 --> 04:51:27,619
Why would you...

1011
04:51:27,619 --> 04:51:28,020
Why would...

1012
04:51:28,740 --> 04:51:30,020
I can't get back up here now.

1013
04:51:30,020 --> 04:51:31,060
What are you doing?

1014
04:51:31,060 --> 04:51:44,330
What the hell is this thing?

1015
04:51:59,610 --> 04:51:59,930
Let's see.

1016
04:51:59,930 --> 04:52:00,569
Yeah.

1017
04:52:00,569 --> 04:52:07,209
It's a long way to go.

1018
04:52:19,450 --> 04:52:21,049
Oh, it's in there.

1019
04:52:21,049 --> 04:52:21,849
Okay, I know what to do.

1020
04:52:27,259 --> 04:52:29,419
They fall like the sims.

1021
04:52:29,419 --> 04:53:02,259
That is all the treasure here.

1022
04:53:02,259 --> 04:53:08,580
I should be able to get across, right?

1023
04:53:08,580 --> 04:53:20,950
This gets me all the way across.

1024
04:53:20,950 --> 04:53:23,610
And then back to here.

1025
04:53:24,169 --> 04:53:26,009
So where am I going now?

1026
04:53:26,009 --> 04:53:27,450
Where's the mausoleum?

1027
04:53:27,450 --> 04:53:34,900
Should I go across here and just up?

1028
04:53:35,540 --> 04:53:37,220
I can't make it across this, right?

1029
04:53:37,220 --> 04:53:39,720
It's a place where you were with Ashley.

1030
04:53:45,619 --> 04:53:46,419
Get the bolts.

1031
04:53:46,419 --> 04:53:47,220
Can I?

1032
04:53:47,220 --> 04:53:51,240
I don't think I can go up.

1033
04:53:51,240 --> 04:53:55,400
Could I have gone up?

1034
04:53:55,400 --> 04:53:56,200
Just didn't see it.

1035
04:53:56,200 --> 04:53:56,759
Okay, I can.

1036
04:54:01,209 --> 04:54:01,610
Thank you.

1037
04:54:20,419 --> 04:54:32,779
Uh, I think they actually are gone.

1038
04:54:40,569 --> 04:54:41,209
Shit.

1039
04:54:41,209 --> 04:54:47,740
I don't see one of those balls to drop either.

1040
04:54:47,740 --> 04:54:53,880
That's unfortunate.

1041
04:54:53,880 --> 04:54:56,360
I'm glad it took 12 arrows to kill that person.

1042
04:54:56,360 --> 04:55:17,689
Repeat that again.

1043
04:55:17,689 --> 04:55:26,889
You dropped the thing.

1044
04:55:26,889 --> 04:55:30,069
Fucked.

1045
04:55:30,069 --> 04:55:33,529
All right, we're back in here now.

1046
04:55:33,529 --> 04:55:37,029
Courtyard.

1047
04:55:37,029 --> 04:55:44,599
So from the courtyard, I need to go here, you're saying, right?

1048
04:55:44,599 --> 04:55:46,040
Down here in the wine cellar?

1049
04:55:46,040 --> 04:55:47,720
Is that correct?

1050
04:55:47,720 --> 04:56:11,900
I cleared all this from the three-headed mirror room.

1051
04:56:11,900 --> 04:56:15,819
So in here.

1052
04:56:15,819 --> 04:56:18,869
I don't even remember where the hell that was.

1053
04:56:18,869 --> 04:56:20,709
Oh, throne room is right here.

1054
04:56:20,709 --> 04:56:21,750
All right, hold on.

1055
04:56:21,750 --> 04:56:26,950
It was great.

1056
04:56:26,950 --> 04:56:27,509
It was right here.

1057
04:56:27,509 --> 04:56:28,470
It's the grand hall.

1058
04:56:28,470 --> 04:56:31,430
So grand hall to...

1059
04:56:32,150 --> 04:56:38,729
Can I get in this door now?

1060
04:56:38,729 --> 04:56:42,650
Oh, some rare things for sale.

1061
04:56:42,650 --> 04:57:00,680
It's the fastest way to get back there.

1062
04:57:00,680 --> 04:57:10,599
I got thrown to the courtyard.

1063
04:57:10,599 --> 04:57:26,709
Ah, I'm gonna go turn this in.

1064
04:57:39,400 --> 04:57:39,880
Thank you.

1065
04:57:42,119 --> 04:57:43,080
All right, how are we doing?

1066
04:57:43,080 --> 04:57:43,720
I have...

1067
04:57:44,520 --> 04:57:49,639
Let's go ahead and get that one hundred thousand dollars.

1068
04:57:51,849 --> 04:57:56,970
Boom.

1069
04:57:56,970 --> 04:57:58,409
Also, I can do this.

1070
04:58:00,900 --> 04:58:01,540
Sell this too.

1071
04:58:03,060 --> 04:58:03,459
Green.

1072
04:58:05,139 --> 04:58:06,819
And blue is the most expensive, right?

1073
04:58:07,560 --> 04:58:18,360
Or is it yellow?

1074
04:58:18,360 --> 04:58:18,680
Cool.

1075
04:58:19,319 --> 04:58:21,159
And then this one is still hanging around.

1076
04:58:23,159 --> 04:58:24,659
100k.

1077
04:58:25,479 --> 04:58:27,799
One hundred and twenty three thousand dollars.

1078
04:58:31,080 --> 04:58:31,560
Hell yeah.

1079
04:58:39,900 --> 04:59:21,259
I'm just gonna get rid of the laser sight.

1080
04:59:21,979 --> 04:59:25,689
Yeah, what's the point of having this?

1081
04:59:26,490 --> 04:59:27,930
I'm not gonna use it for anything.

1082
04:59:27,930 --> 04:59:29,610
I'm not using any of these weapons.

1083
04:59:32,299 --> 04:59:34,009
Let's max this thing out.

1084
04:59:37,130 --> 04:59:40,409
A hundred thousand to make this thing disgusting.

1085
04:59:41,369 --> 04:59:41,610
Or...

1086
04:59:51,450 --> 04:59:52,090
You get the ticket.

1087
04:59:56,650 --> 04:59:57,369
I can get the ticket.

1088
04:59:58,169 --> 04:59:59,049
I think that's the play.

1089
05:00:02,759 --> 05:00:04,360
I'll get that after beating the knight.

1090
05:00:05,319 --> 05:00:12,439
I need to make some herbs here.

1091
05:00:20,229 --> 05:00:22,330
Wait, I already...

1092
05:00:22,330 --> 05:00:28,619
Wait, what's going on?

1093
05:00:28,619 --> 05:00:30,299
What if I had a yellow?

1094
05:00:31,020 --> 05:00:39,349
I don't.

1095
05:00:39,349 --> 05:00:45,750
Give me the proc.

1096
05:00:45,750 --> 05:00:47,909
There's 30 shots in this.

1097
05:00:47,909 --> 05:00:48,630
Oh my god.

1098
05:00:51,560 --> 05:00:52,360
30.

1099
05:00:52,360 --> 05:00:53,400
We're getting there.

1100
05:00:53,400 --> 05:01:04,180
What about the broken butterfly?

1101
05:01:04,180 --> 05:01:05,540
Do the ticket on the broken butterfly?

1102
05:01:07,619 --> 05:01:10,500
I don't know if I'm gonna have enough money to upgrade the broken butterfly.

1103
05:01:11,459 --> 05:01:12,979
Maybe much later in the game.

1104
05:01:13,540 --> 05:01:15,930
All right, so we need to go this way.

1105
05:01:15,930 --> 05:01:28,740
I need to go right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,

1106
05:01:29,299 --> 05:01:58,939
and go right, right, right, okay, and straight.

1107
05:01:58,939 --> 05:02:08,810
Let's go.

1108
05:02:11,099 --> 05:02:12,220
Good luck.

1109
05:02:12,220 --> 05:02:25,459
These side quests are really, really fun.

1110
05:02:27,540 --> 05:02:30,500
It makes backtracking way more interesting.

1111
05:02:30,500 --> 05:02:45,540
Hey, hope all is well.

1112
05:02:45,540 --> 05:02:47,060
Hey, right back.

1113
05:02:47,060 --> 05:02:47,860
Right back at you.

1114
05:02:53,509 --> 05:02:54,549
That's the knight.

1115
05:02:54,549 --> 05:02:56,310
The golden knight.

1116
05:02:56,310 --> 05:03:19,740
I'm loading a fucking bomb on this thing.

1117
05:03:19,740 --> 05:03:20,240
Whoa.

1118
05:03:31,349 --> 05:03:32,790
Yeah, another one.

1119
05:03:56,119 --> 05:03:58,340
Oh, shit.

1120
05:03:58,340 --> 05:04:13,459
That hurt.

1121
05:04:13,459 --> 05:04:14,419
Pop it.

1122
05:04:14,419 --> 05:04:15,060
What's going on?

1123
05:04:17,349 --> 05:04:17,830
Blow up.

1124
05:04:17,830 --> 05:04:19,110
Why is it not blowing up?

1125
05:04:19,110 --> 05:04:20,250
What's going on?

1126
05:04:23,669 --> 05:04:24,630
It's on the ground.

1127
05:04:35,770 --> 05:04:36,270
Die.

1128
05:04:51,639 --> 05:04:52,040
Wow.

1129
05:04:52,599 --> 05:04:56,970
Jeez.

1130
05:04:56,970 --> 05:05:01,529
What do you get?

1131
05:05:01,529 --> 05:05:03,770
You get all three colors.

1132
05:05:03,770 --> 05:05:07,189
Stop yelling.

1133
05:05:07,189 --> 05:05:13,669
You're gonna wake my parents up.

1134
05:05:13,669 --> 05:05:14,310
Very cool.

1135
05:05:14,310 --> 05:05:16,229
All right, so that was really cool.

1136
05:05:16,229 --> 05:05:16,709
That was fun.

1137
05:05:16,709 --> 05:05:18,150
I like these little mini bosses.

1138
05:05:18,150 --> 05:05:19,909
That's so, what a cool addition.

1139
05:05:19,909 --> 05:05:24,439
Found a use for those.

1140
05:05:29,529 --> 05:05:30,810
The mines I think carried.

1141
05:05:30,810 --> 05:05:31,930
This thing is so good.

1142
05:05:31,930 --> 05:05:33,610
I talked way too much shit about this.

1143
05:05:37,099 --> 05:05:39,500
This new weapon, the bolt, crossbow thing.

1144
05:05:42,040 --> 05:05:43,319
Is really good.

1145
05:05:43,319 --> 05:05:44,040
It's really good.

1146
05:05:44,599 --> 05:05:46,229
I talked a lot of shit about it.

1147
05:05:50,220 --> 05:05:56,279
Nearly infinite ammo and has bombs on it.

1148
05:05:56,279 --> 05:05:57,720
Did I lose the arrows?

1149
05:05:57,720 --> 05:05:59,479
Did I shoot them into the ceiling or something?

1150
05:05:59,479 --> 05:06:01,959
I think I did.

1151
05:06:16,569 --> 05:06:19,000
Rock.

1152
05:06:19,000 --> 05:06:20,259
Finally.

1153
05:06:20,259 --> 05:06:31,500
There we go.

1154
05:06:31,500 --> 05:06:46,459
That's so, I can't wait to shoot this like 30, 40 times in a row.

1155
05:06:46,459 --> 05:06:48,919
Now the throne room and that's it.

1156
05:06:48,919 --> 05:06:50,759
We've done pretty much all the side things in the castle.

1157
05:06:53,110 --> 05:06:54,389
And then we're in the end game, Peter.

1158
05:06:54,389 --> 05:07:18,200
I just need to go out through here.

1159
05:07:18,200 --> 05:07:23,240
So straight, right, straight, straight.

1160
05:07:23,240 --> 05:07:49,529
Straight, right, straight, straight.

1161
05:07:49,529 --> 05:07:50,250
Again.

1162
05:07:50,250 --> 05:07:52,500
Did I unlock this door?

1163
05:07:52,500 --> 05:07:53,619
I hope I did.

1164
05:07:53,619 --> 05:07:54,979
Yeah, I did.

1165
05:07:54,979 --> 05:08:04,020
And then it's straight again.

1166
05:08:04,020 --> 05:08:04,659
What?

1167
05:08:04,659 --> 05:08:08,229
Oh, right, right, right.

1168
05:08:08,229 --> 05:08:08,790
It's fine.

1169
05:08:08,790 --> 05:08:18,919
Got everything here, right?

1170
05:08:18,919 --> 05:08:19,639
Yes.

1171
05:08:19,639 --> 05:08:22,919
Throne room time.

1172
05:08:22,919 --> 05:08:36,650
Did I, I left this place in a pretty sorry state, huh?

1173
05:08:36,650 --> 05:08:41,130
Oh my God.

1174
05:08:56,069 --> 05:08:57,110
Jesus.

1175
05:08:57,110 --> 05:08:58,279
Stop.

1176
05:08:58,279 --> 05:09:03,479
Stop running.

1177
05:09:03,479 --> 05:09:05,080
Oh my goodness.

1178
05:09:05,080 --> 05:09:15,159
Spurs don't even have a head.

1179
05:09:19,259 --> 05:09:24,680
Yeah, man.

1180
05:09:25,240 --> 05:09:40,709
I didn't have a head.

1181
05:09:40,790 --> 05:09:42,299
And he was still running at me.

1182
05:09:42,299 --> 05:10:07,299
I'm a mess.

1183
05:10:07,299 --> 05:10:08,659
Is something scary in here?

1184
05:10:08,659 --> 05:10:23,720
We're eight years since my awakening.

1185
05:10:23,720 --> 05:10:28,599
Alas, my noble pursuit progresses to its final stage, the fusion of human and insect.

1186
05:10:28,599 --> 05:10:32,090
The housekeeper has graciously volunteered herself for the experiment.

1187
05:10:32,090 --> 05:10:37,419
I shall pour my whole heart into this endeavor in order to transcend humanity and make

1188
05:10:37,419 --> 05:10:40,380
Master Ramon proud.

1189
05:10:40,380 --> 05:10:41,979
March, nine years since my awakening.

1190
05:10:41,979 --> 05:10:45,099
A glorious union has been made.

1191
05:10:45,099 --> 05:10:47,669
The housekeeper has endured much suffering.

1192
05:10:47,669 --> 05:10:48,860
Not for naught.

1193
05:10:48,860 --> 05:10:51,819
Behold, the fruits of our labor and all of its beauty.

1194
05:10:51,819 --> 05:10:57,259
I shall consecrate this perfect life form with the name U3, where three is the most

1195
05:10:57,259 --> 05:10:58,779
beautiful and complete number.

1196
05:10:58,779 --> 05:11:03,479
I think ten is.

1197
05:11:03,479 --> 05:11:10,439
I think ten is like a complete number.

1198
05:11:10,439 --> 05:11:12,040
April, nine years since my awakening.

1199
05:11:12,040 --> 05:11:18,869
U3, my dear hound, Pezenta, has been chosen to serve as the right hand of Master Ramon.

1200
05:11:18,869 --> 05:11:21,479
But is two not better than one?

1201
05:11:21,479 --> 05:11:24,040
Now it is my turn to demonstrate my loyalty.

1202
05:11:24,040 --> 05:11:28,360
His humble servant, Isidro Girarte Talavera.

1203
05:11:28,360 --> 05:11:32,709
The best things come in threes.

1204
05:11:35,220 --> 05:11:36,099
Like, one hundred, though.

1205
05:11:38,459 --> 05:11:40,520
Denominations of one hundred?

1206
05:11:40,520 --> 05:11:43,080
Like, one hundred, I think, is a complete number.

1207
05:11:45,659 --> 05:11:53,240
Ten, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, one million, ten million, a hundred million.

1208
05:12:01,909 --> 05:12:03,029
There are treasures here.

1209
05:12:03,590 --> 05:12:08,279
Why are there chickens everywhere?

1210
05:12:08,279 --> 05:12:10,549
How do I make them lay eggs?

1211
05:12:10,549 --> 05:12:12,389
Why are there chickens in here?

1212
05:12:12,389 --> 05:12:24,180
Why are they in here?

1213
05:12:24,180 --> 05:12:28,580
Oh, Master Ramon, with tomorrow's procedure, I shall finally surpass the limitations of

1214
05:12:28,580 --> 05:12:29,700
this mortal shell.

1215
05:12:30,099 --> 05:12:33,060
What's left of me now shall be gone soon.

1216
05:12:33,060 --> 05:12:35,060
Magnificent, the holy body is a wondrous miracle.

1217
05:12:35,619 --> 05:12:39,779
The fealty I've sworn to Master Ramon is the sole light that illuminates my path.

1218
05:12:39,779 --> 05:12:43,500
Our fates shall be entwined until the very end.

1219
05:12:43,500 --> 05:12:45,020
Have you ever known such loyalty?

1220
05:12:48,680 --> 05:13:03,930
That's a golden egg.

1221
05:13:03,930 --> 05:13:05,369
I'll be taking this.

1222
05:13:05,369 --> 05:13:27,240
I'll be taking that one.

1223
05:13:27,240 --> 05:13:30,439
Cool.

1224
05:13:30,439 --> 05:13:34,340
Now the painting.

1225
05:13:34,340 --> 05:13:36,659
I feel like my hair looks like that sometimes.

1226
05:13:36,659 --> 05:13:37,459
Where's the painting?

1227
05:13:38,020 --> 05:13:52,310
Are you laying eggs?

1228
05:13:52,310 --> 05:13:53,750
Where's the paint?

1229
05:13:53,750 --> 05:13:54,549
What am I looking for?

1230
05:13:55,029 --> 05:14:05,270
Got that one.

1231
05:14:05,270 --> 05:14:06,520
Got that one.

1232
05:14:06,520 --> 05:14:12,700
To face Ramon's portrait.

1233
05:14:15,419 --> 05:14:16,299
Oh, it's just...

1234
05:14:16,299 --> 05:14:17,259
Okay, I thought it was a dream.

1235
05:14:17,259 --> 05:14:18,060
So just destroy it.

1236
05:14:18,060 --> 05:14:19,580
Okay, I can do that.

1237
05:14:19,580 --> 05:14:23,529
That didn't work.

1238
05:14:23,529 --> 05:14:34,729
I need an egg?

1239
05:14:35,939 --> 05:14:37,220
Throw an egg at it.

1240
05:14:37,220 --> 05:14:43,180
That's a golden egg.

1241
05:14:45,779 --> 05:14:46,259
How do I...

1242
05:14:46,259 --> 05:14:47,299
I don't want to throw the golden egg.

1243
05:14:50,200 --> 05:14:50,919
Give me an egg.

1244
05:14:55,380 --> 05:15:00,040
Egg?

1245
05:15:00,040 --> 05:15:01,080
Just wait for the chickens.

1246
05:15:01,080 --> 05:15:36,580
Don't chase them.

1247
05:15:36,580 --> 05:15:37,619
There actually is.

1248
05:15:37,619 --> 05:15:45,689
I'm dressed in the right outfit too.

1249
05:15:45,689 --> 05:15:47,049
Elden Lord.

1250
05:15:47,049 --> 05:16:01,959
I need an egg.

1251
05:16:05,180 --> 05:16:20,090
Is this the right guy?

1252
05:16:28,099 --> 05:16:30,279
Lay an egg already.

1253
05:16:30,279 --> 05:16:31,000
I have an egg.

1254
05:16:31,000 --> 05:16:32,439
I don't want to throw a golden egg.

1255
05:16:32,439 --> 05:16:34,360
This thing is worth a lot of money.

1256
05:16:34,360 --> 05:16:37,459
It's worth like 10 grand.

1257
05:16:37,459 --> 05:16:38,580
Lay an egg yourself.

1258
05:16:38,580 --> 05:17:01,860
I'm just going to sit right here.

1259
05:17:01,860 --> 05:17:02,759
I'm not going to bother them.

1260
05:17:02,759 --> 05:17:15,639
I'm going to let them do their thing.

1261
05:17:15,639 --> 05:17:17,139
Shoot one?

1262
05:17:17,139 --> 05:17:18,580
No, I don't want to shoot one.

1263
05:17:18,580 --> 05:17:37,130
Shoot the air scare them.

1264
05:17:37,130 --> 05:17:38,090
They'll drop one.

1265
05:17:38,090 --> 05:17:55,400
This chicken does not give a shit.

1266
05:18:00,419 --> 05:18:01,299
They don't care.

1267
05:18:01,299 --> 05:18:14,860
The chicken?

1268
05:18:14,860 --> 05:18:15,500
You can't.

1269
05:18:15,500 --> 05:18:21,860
I feel like an egg is supposed to drop here,

1270
05:18:21,860 --> 05:18:26,330
but the game does not want to give me one.

1271
05:18:26,330 --> 05:18:28,330
Very clearly this chicken's in this room

1272
05:18:28,330 --> 05:18:32,439
because we're supposed to shoot it.

1273
05:18:32,439 --> 05:18:33,080
I don't...

1274
05:18:33,080 --> 05:18:34,840
What if I shoot it and shoot it?

1275
05:18:34,840 --> 05:18:38,580
They gave you one.

1276
05:18:38,580 --> 05:18:41,060
No, I had to get the puzzle box to get one.

1277
05:19:03,220 --> 05:19:04,500
You can actually even...

1278
05:19:04,500 --> 05:19:05,060
That's funny.

1279
05:19:05,060 --> 05:19:07,540
You can do that.

1280
05:19:07,540 --> 05:19:11,340
You can throw eggs at people.

1281
05:19:11,340 --> 05:19:14,200
Just wait until a few weeks go by

1282
05:19:14,200 --> 05:19:16,360
and somebody does a egg percent.

1283
05:19:16,360 --> 05:19:18,869
Or they just farm eggs, fill their inventory,

1284
05:19:18,869 --> 05:19:21,110
put on all the egg charms

1285
05:19:21,110 --> 05:19:23,590
and kill the last boss with eggs.

1286
05:19:23,590 --> 05:19:25,189
This is going to happen.

1287
05:19:25,189 --> 05:19:30,060
All right.

1288
05:19:30,060 --> 05:19:31,099
Thank you for the eggs.

1289
05:19:31,099 --> 05:19:32,220
I appreciate it.

1290
05:19:32,540 --> 05:19:34,779
Have a nice...

1291
05:19:34,779 --> 05:19:37,110
Get another one.

1292
05:19:37,110 --> 05:19:37,750
I got a better idea.

1293
05:19:37,750 --> 05:19:38,869
I'm just going to fucking...

1294
05:19:38,869 --> 05:20:02,060
I have a charm that heals me 100%.

1295
05:20:02,060 --> 05:20:03,189
Two is enough.

1296
05:20:03,189 --> 05:20:03,830
Two is enough.

1297
05:20:03,830 --> 05:20:04,950
You've worked...

1298
05:20:04,950 --> 05:20:05,509
You've done...

1299
05:20:05,509 --> 05:20:07,400
Good job.

1300
05:20:07,400 --> 05:20:08,439
Two is enough.

1301
05:20:08,439 --> 05:20:10,099
Three would be great.

1302
05:20:10,099 --> 05:20:10,740
Two is enough.

1303
05:20:11,299 --> 05:20:12,900
Three would be great.

1304
05:20:12,900 --> 05:20:15,779
Two is enough, though.

1305
05:20:15,779 --> 05:20:17,110
Two is enough.

1306
05:20:17,110 --> 05:20:19,029
Three would be fantastic.

1307
05:20:19,029 --> 05:20:19,830
Two is enough.

1308
05:20:19,830 --> 05:20:25,299
There you go.

1309
05:20:25,299 --> 05:20:26,569
All right.

1310
05:20:26,569 --> 05:20:32,700
I wish you very long chicken lives.

1311
05:20:32,700 --> 05:20:42,779
Good day.

1312
05:20:42,779 --> 05:20:45,400
Very nice.

1313
05:20:45,400 --> 05:20:47,479
So turn in

1314
05:20:47,479 --> 05:20:56,060
and then we're going to make our way that way.

1315
05:20:56,060 --> 05:20:56,779
Back to where we were.

1316
05:20:57,419 --> 05:21:08,790
Whatever.

1317
05:21:08,790 --> 05:21:09,990
I got work at 6 a.m.

1318
05:21:09,990 --> 05:21:10,549
Speed it up.

1319
05:21:12,119 --> 05:21:14,169
I can assure you

1320
05:21:14,729 --> 05:21:17,700
that I am at least...

1321
05:21:17,700 --> 05:21:18,340
At least

1322
05:21:19,299 --> 05:21:21,380
6 to 10 hours away from completing this game.

1323
05:21:22,919 --> 05:21:23,159
At...

1324
05:21:23,959 --> 05:21:24,599
At minimum.

1325
05:21:31,270 --> 05:21:32,950
Are you seriously going to do that right now?

1326
05:21:36,819 --> 05:21:38,580
You're not going to actually make me take this

1327
05:21:43,500 --> 05:21:44,299
bunch of shit.

1328
05:21:44,299 --> 05:21:45,740
I can't believe I actually had to do that.

1329
05:21:46,380 --> 05:22:09,590
Let me just go turn these in.

1330
05:22:10,540 --> 05:22:11,979
I'm going to upgrade this.

1331
05:22:12,540 --> 05:22:13,020
No, I'm not.

1332
05:22:13,020 --> 05:22:14,299
I'm going to get the ticket at least.

1333
05:22:19,500 --> 05:22:20,380
Eight spinals.

1334
05:22:21,259 --> 05:22:22,060
Four spinals.

1335
05:22:23,750 --> 05:22:24,069
All right.

1336
05:22:24,069 --> 05:22:25,029
I'm going to buy one of these.

1337
05:22:25,990 --> 05:22:26,950
So now I have it.

1338
05:22:29,830 --> 05:22:30,229
And then...

1339
05:22:32,229 --> 05:22:33,110
Wait a minute here.

1340
05:22:41,000 --> 05:22:42,680
Oh, yeah.

1341
05:22:43,240 --> 05:22:48,099
The ticket is pointless.

1342
05:22:49,080 --> 05:22:52,360
The ticket is not pointless because

1343
05:22:53,319 --> 05:22:58,040
I don't want to spend $100,000 on this.

1344
05:23:02,060 --> 05:23:05,580
Essentially, the ticket is worth $100,000.

1345
05:23:06,139 --> 05:23:10,229
So if I plan on upgrading this at all anymore

1346
05:23:10,229 --> 05:23:12,150
or the magnum,

1347
05:23:12,790 --> 05:23:15,659
that's $100,000 that I can actually upgrade a third weapon with.

1348
05:23:16,299 --> 05:23:20,840
So it's worth it, especially for the expensive stuff.

1349
05:23:21,560 --> 05:23:24,060
Essentially trading this for $100,000.

1350
05:23:29,290 --> 05:23:30,889
Okay.

1351
05:23:30,889 --> 05:23:33,580
Okay.

1352
05:23:33,580 --> 05:23:34,139
Very nice.

1353
05:23:38,439 --> 05:23:39,639
Let's continue.

1354
05:23:40,279 --> 05:23:43,459
Next place I'm going is just progress,

1355
05:23:44,180 --> 05:23:47,529
which is this way, right?

1356
05:23:51,700 --> 05:23:52,099
Yeah.

1357
05:23:54,330 --> 05:23:54,650
Yes.

1358
05:23:55,209 --> 05:23:57,369
Because I had to ride the trolley.

1359
05:23:57,369 --> 05:23:57,689
Okay.

1360
05:23:58,250 --> 05:23:59,779
Hang a right.

1361
05:23:59,779 --> 05:24:01,180
Hang a right.

1362
05:24:01,180 --> 05:24:02,310
Straight.

1363
05:24:02,310 --> 05:24:15,159
Upgrade.

1364
05:24:15,159 --> 05:24:16,490
You didn't use it.

1365
05:24:16,490 --> 05:24:17,209
Use the ticket.

1366
05:24:17,209 --> 05:24:17,689
What?

1367
05:24:17,689 --> 05:24:21,689
No, no, no.

1368
05:24:21,689 --> 05:24:22,490
I don't want to.

1369
05:24:22,490 --> 05:24:22,889
Not yet.

1370
05:24:24,700 --> 05:24:25,099
Not yet.

1371
05:24:25,659 --> 05:24:29,880
Oh, I walked in a circle.

1372
05:24:30,520 --> 05:24:31,880
Not yet because I want to know

1373
05:24:32,599 --> 05:24:33,880
if I upgrade the other stuff,

1374
05:24:33,880 --> 05:24:35,560
I want to make sure I have a ticket.

1375
05:24:35,560 --> 05:24:37,580
It's called hoarding.

1376
05:24:40,439 --> 05:24:41,479
I haven't made a decision.

1377
05:24:41,479 --> 05:24:43,799
What if I want to use the ticket on the revolver?

1378
05:24:43,799 --> 05:24:46,040
What if I want to use the ticket on the bolt gun?

1379
05:24:46,040 --> 05:24:48,840
You know what I mean?

1380
05:24:48,840 --> 05:24:50,439
It's called hoarding and it's called

1381
05:24:50,439 --> 05:24:53,639
having remorse for selling or whatever it is.

1382
05:24:54,200 --> 05:24:55,770
That makes no sense.

1383
05:24:55,770 --> 05:24:56,490
Yes, it does.

1384
05:24:56,490 --> 05:24:59,909
What do you mean?

1385
05:24:59,909 --> 05:25:03,540
Then it wouldn't be worth $100,000.

1386
05:25:03,540 --> 05:25:12,099
The tickets do not require it to be fully upgraded.

1387
05:25:12,099 --> 05:25:19,560
What do you mean?

1388
05:25:19,560 --> 05:25:21,720
No, you fully upgrade everything.

1389
05:25:21,720 --> 05:25:25,290
Spend $60,000 on the bolt gun.

1390
05:25:25,290 --> 05:25:26,569
I don't have $60,000.

1391
05:25:26,569 --> 05:25:27,720
I'm just going to hold it.

1392
05:25:28,279 --> 05:25:29,479
I'm going to hold.

1393
05:25:29,479 --> 05:25:30,279
I'm holding it.

1394
05:25:31,639 --> 05:25:33,799
You can use the ticket on any weapon without upgrading it.

1395
05:25:36,659 --> 05:25:36,979
What?

1396
05:25:38,060 --> 05:25:41,540
I thought it was either spend money or the ticket.

1397
05:25:41,540 --> 05:25:42,020
Hold on.

1398
05:25:42,020 --> 05:25:42,979
I'm confused now.

1399
05:25:43,459 --> 05:25:44,259
Now I got hit.

1400
05:26:02,459 --> 05:26:05,659
Just let me get back up here so I'm not as confused.

1401
05:26:05,659 --> 05:26:06,220
Give me a second.

1402
05:26:11,900 --> 05:26:13,580
Where the hell am I going?

1403
05:26:13,580 --> 05:26:19,259
Is it down and then?

1404
05:26:19,259 --> 05:26:20,299
Wait, where am I going here?

1405
05:26:20,299 --> 05:26:21,180
What the fuck is happening?

1406
05:26:33,110 --> 05:26:34,069
Why is that closed?

1407
05:26:35,189 --> 05:26:35,909
Where am I going?

1408
05:26:36,549 --> 05:26:44,299
Bro, where am I going right now?

1409
05:26:44,299 --> 05:26:45,900
Where am I going right now?

1410
05:26:46,860 --> 05:26:47,900
I'm like running back to the...

1411
05:26:48,540 --> 05:26:53,500
This room sucks.

1412
05:26:55,319 --> 05:26:56,759
They just never-endingly spawn.

1413
05:26:57,319 --> 05:27:02,709
Bro, where am I going?

1414
05:27:16,119 --> 05:27:16,360
All right.

1415
05:27:16,360 --> 05:27:17,479
Let me look at this one more time.

1416
05:27:17,479 --> 05:27:19,560
Welcome.

1417
05:27:19,560 --> 05:27:20,759
What can I do you?

1418
05:27:20,759 --> 05:27:28,409
You have a ticket, do you?

1419
05:27:28,409 --> 05:27:30,569
Choose a weapon, stranger.

1420
05:27:30,569 --> 05:27:34,229
And I'll make it seem.

1421
05:27:34,229 --> 05:27:35,750
So I don't have...

1422
05:27:37,029 --> 05:27:38,790
This will upgrade the whole thing.

1423
05:27:39,349 --> 05:27:42,250
Knife needs care, everyone.

1424
05:27:42,250 --> 05:27:44,330
So this will max the whole weapon out is what you're saying.

1425
05:27:45,209 --> 05:27:49,139
No, it only gives the exclusive.

1426
05:27:49,700 --> 05:27:52,599
So then what's the problem then?

1427
05:27:53,240 --> 05:28:03,740
There is no problem.

1428
05:28:03,740 --> 05:28:06,340
You don't need to max it out to get the exclusive.

1429
05:28:07,909 --> 05:28:10,150
Oh, okay.

1430
05:28:10,150 --> 05:28:12,069
Okay, I say sorry.

1431
05:28:12,069 --> 05:28:13,270
There's like music in my ears.

1432
05:28:15,000 --> 05:28:15,880
So it just...

1433
05:28:16,759 --> 05:28:18,279
You don't have to upgrade it all the way.

1434
05:28:18,279 --> 05:28:18,759
I get it.

1435
05:28:18,759 --> 05:28:19,400
But I don't...

1436
05:28:19,400 --> 05:28:23,099
Do I want to use this on the revolver?

1437
05:28:23,099 --> 05:28:24,860
There's three weapons that I want to get to max.

1438
05:28:25,419 --> 05:28:27,180
And I don't know what two of them there are.

1439
05:28:28,840 --> 05:28:29,799
There's this one.

1440
05:28:29,799 --> 05:28:30,439
There's this one.

1441
05:28:30,439 --> 05:28:31,319
And then there's a revolver.

1442
05:28:33,529 --> 05:28:34,009
I don't know.

1443
05:28:34,009 --> 05:28:36,490
Because I've got to figure out which one I want to do that to.

1444
05:28:37,209 --> 05:28:42,819
Do I want to do it to the bolt gun and the revolver?

1445
05:28:42,819 --> 05:28:45,139
Or the handgun and the revolver?

1446
05:28:45,139 --> 05:28:46,259
Or the handgun and the bolt gun?

1447
05:28:46,900 --> 05:28:52,389
This is the most logical decision.

1448
05:28:53,959 --> 05:28:55,159
So I guess we'll do this one.

1449
05:28:59,779 --> 05:29:02,500
But this thing is now amazing.

1450
05:29:05,110 --> 05:29:11,900
So now I'm going to focus all of my money into the revolver, I think.

1451
05:29:11,900 --> 05:29:16,299
If you want a fighting chance out there, you best tune up your kit.

1452
05:29:17,099 --> 05:29:24,520
Well, the magnum.

1453
05:29:24,520 --> 05:29:25,020
Whatever.

1454
05:29:27,479 --> 05:29:29,959
I should be able to do it to three of them.

1455
05:29:30,599 --> 05:29:39,560
Why is the third save point gone?

1456
05:29:39,560 --> 05:29:41,590
That's freaking me out.

1457
05:29:41,590 --> 05:29:44,069
All right.

1458
05:29:44,069 --> 05:29:46,869
I am ready to go and I want to make sure I get this the right way.

1459
05:29:46,869 --> 05:29:47,909
So it's...

1460
05:29:47,909 --> 05:29:49,619
How did I fuck this up?

1461
05:29:50,180 --> 05:29:53,849
It's out here, to the right, to the...

1462
05:29:53,849 --> 05:29:54,490
Okay.

1463
05:29:54,490 --> 05:29:55,610
Is it from the ballroom?

1464
05:29:56,250 --> 05:30:01,689
The autosave was the third...

1465
05:30:01,689 --> 05:30:02,490
Oh, okay.

1466
05:30:02,490 --> 05:30:05,509
It's north of the bug room.

1467
05:30:05,509 --> 05:30:08,250
I feel like I was going that way.

1468
05:30:08,810 --> 05:30:13,319
You were actually going the right direction.

1469
05:30:13,319 --> 05:30:13,959
Oh, shit.

1470
05:30:13,959 --> 05:30:14,680
I just freaked out.

1471
05:30:15,479 --> 05:30:20,180
So it's in the bug room, left.

1472
05:30:20,180 --> 05:30:29,139
Just don't go up the stairs.

1473
05:30:40,009 --> 05:30:40,569
All right.

1474
05:30:40,569 --> 05:30:42,169
You know, I thought this was blocked off.

1475
05:30:42,169 --> 05:30:42,889
That was my problem.

1476
05:30:54,220 --> 05:30:55,500
I thought it was blocked off.

1477
05:30:55,500 --> 05:30:56,060
All right.

1478
05:30:56,060 --> 05:30:57,580
Time to actually get game progress.

1479
05:30:58,299 --> 05:31:02,409
Probably not going to stream for that much longer.

1480
05:31:02,409 --> 05:31:04,810
Maybe to the end of this chapter, I would say.

1481
05:31:05,529 --> 05:31:06,250
Maybe the boss.

1482
05:31:06,250 --> 05:31:07,610
I think we're getting close to the boss.

1483
05:31:08,250 --> 05:31:19,580
Straight up here.

1484
05:31:21,740 --> 05:31:22,380
All right, Ashley.

1485
05:31:22,380 --> 05:31:23,099
I'm finally here.

1486
05:31:23,900 --> 05:31:24,220
Sorry.

1487
05:31:24,220 --> 05:31:26,459
I had to communicate with a bunch of people on upgrades.

1488
05:31:52,939 --> 05:31:54,060
You wish.

1489
05:31:54,060 --> 05:31:56,279
At the top of the tower.

1490
05:32:13,080 --> 05:32:13,880
Oh, it makes sure...

1491
05:32:13,880 --> 05:32:14,840
No one to run.

1492
05:32:14,840 --> 05:32:23,500
I wanted to suplex the guy

1493
05:32:23,500 --> 05:32:24,939
because everybody was yelling at me to do it.

1494
05:32:25,580 --> 05:32:46,250
Cool.

1495
05:32:46,250 --> 05:32:46,810
All right.

1496
05:32:46,810 --> 05:33:20,060
I am almost out of ammo.

1497
05:33:20,060 --> 05:33:21,340
God, I like this gun.

1498
05:33:21,340 --> 05:33:22,619
I picked wrong.

1499
05:33:22,619 --> 05:33:24,889
I have Settler's Remorse.

1500
05:33:24,889 --> 05:33:26,650
Fire's Remorse.

1501
05:33:26,650 --> 05:33:27,770
I should have upgraded this all the way.

1502
05:33:33,000 --> 05:33:34,279
I'm just going to restart the whole game.

1503
05:34:23,930 --> 05:34:24,250
Free!

1504
05:34:24,889 --> 05:34:51,060
Probably a treasure from that.

1505
05:34:52,549 --> 05:34:55,369
There's a treasure from that, right?

1506
05:34:55,369 --> 05:34:55,930
Right?

1507
05:34:55,930 --> 05:35:17,939
I don't want to miss everything.

1508
05:35:20,650 --> 05:35:20,889
Nice.

1509
05:35:21,529 --> 05:35:23,689
There's a lot of stuff in here.

1510
05:35:24,409 --> 05:35:37,180
There's a lot of stuff in here.

1511
05:35:37,180 --> 05:35:37,740
Right?

1512
05:35:37,740 --> 05:35:56,520
It's 10k right there.

1513
05:35:56,520 --> 05:35:57,080
Simple.

1514
05:35:57,080 --> 05:35:57,639
Easy.

1515
05:35:57,639 --> 05:36:08,939
I guess that big statue does not drop anything.

1516
05:36:22,439 --> 05:36:24,599
I know I'm being map Andy right now,

1517
05:36:24,599 --> 05:36:25,880
but I just want to...

1518
05:36:25,880 --> 05:36:37,180
You got to check it every so often.

1519
05:36:37,180 --> 05:36:50,180
No.

1520
05:36:50,180 --> 05:36:50,500
God.

1521
05:37:06,180 --> 05:37:11,029
Where's the ball?

1522
05:37:12,409 --> 05:37:13,529
That's a slow ball.

1523
05:37:16,680 --> 05:37:17,560
You're going to make it, aren't you?

1524
05:37:19,580 --> 05:37:20,540
You got to be kidding me.

1525
05:37:20,540 --> 05:37:22,139
You actually made that?

1526
05:37:22,139 --> 05:37:23,659
That's impressive, but fuck you.

1527
05:37:24,540 --> 05:38:06,259
Am I safe here?

1528
05:38:06,259 --> 05:38:07,060
Damn it.

1529
05:38:07,060 --> 05:38:14,889
All right.

1530
05:38:14,889 --> 05:38:17,299
There is a treasure somewhere here.

1531
05:39:20,729 --> 05:39:21,770
Looney Tunes.

1532
05:39:21,770 --> 05:39:26,950
This weapon is so much better now.

1533
05:39:26,950 --> 05:39:28,229
I'm glad I listened to you guys.

1534
05:39:28,229 --> 05:39:32,700
I like the bolt gun, but you know, it's okay.

1535
05:39:32,700 --> 05:39:33,180
It's all good.

1536
05:39:39,560 --> 05:39:52,540
Here's one.

1537
05:39:53,259 --> 05:39:58,919
Mirror with pearls and rubies.

1538
05:39:58,919 --> 05:39:59,240
Nice.

1539
05:39:59,799 --> 05:40:04,459
The other treasure is over there.

1540
05:40:04,540 --> 05:40:05,580
Or over there.

1541
05:40:05,580 --> 05:40:08,540
I think I can just go.

1542
05:40:20,520 --> 05:40:22,200
Nice.

1543
05:40:22,200 --> 05:40:24,490
Hey, I got to go to bed.

1544
05:40:24,490 --> 05:40:26,650
Hope you're enjoying Resident Evil 4 Remastered.

1545
05:40:26,650 --> 05:40:31,000
It is fantastic.

1546
05:40:31,000 --> 05:40:33,400
There's one more.

1547
05:40:33,400 --> 05:40:35,419
Oh, well.

1548
05:40:44,599 --> 05:40:52,939
Did he drop his staff?

1549
05:41:10,619 --> 05:42:24,380
Oh, whoa.

1550
05:42:24,380 --> 05:42:24,860
Don't fall.

1551
05:42:30,279 --> 05:42:31,479
Don't push me off, please.

1552
05:42:47,930 --> 05:43:13,110
Let's go.

1553
05:43:13,110 --> 05:43:35,380
Don't miss that.

1554
05:43:35,380 --> 05:43:37,659
Just a silver token.

1555
05:43:37,659 --> 05:43:38,299
That sucks.

1556
05:44:08,310 --> 05:44:09,110
Ashley.

1557
05:44:09,110 --> 05:44:09,750
I forgot.

1558
05:44:13,029 --> 05:44:13,509
It's just...

1559
05:44:14,150 --> 05:44:16,150
It's so out of place.

1560
05:44:16,150 --> 05:44:16,869
It really is.

1561
05:44:16,869 --> 05:44:37,299
I completely forgot that she was in that outfit.

1562
05:44:37,299 --> 05:45:13,080
Almost there.

1563
05:45:13,080 --> 05:45:14,520
Damn, a rifle would be pretty good here.

1564
05:45:14,520 --> 05:45:16,939
Ban that person for five minutes.

1565
05:45:16,939 --> 05:45:19,590
No, ban that person for six minutes.

1566
05:45:19,590 --> 05:45:21,560
We're going over.

1567
05:45:21,560 --> 05:45:51,860
We're going overboard.

1568
05:45:51,860 --> 05:45:52,419
Nice shot.

1569
05:46:11,259 --> 05:46:14,139
She's getting kicked out of the My Chemical Romance concert.

1570
05:46:23,900 --> 05:46:24,860
All right, I got another...

1571
05:46:26,139 --> 05:46:29,720
I think I'm at max health.

1572
05:46:29,720 --> 05:46:33,459
This should do it, right?

1573
05:46:33,459 --> 05:46:34,580
That little bit that's left.

1574
05:46:34,580 --> 05:46:36,580
That should give me 100% max HP.

1575
05:46:38,580 --> 05:46:43,000
Then we don't really care about yellow herbs anymore, which is interesting.

1576
05:46:43,000 --> 05:46:43,479
That's good.

1577
05:47:06,500 --> 05:47:07,939
Do I complete the clock?

1578
05:47:19,139 --> 05:47:21,299
Red is the shittiest, right?

1579
05:47:45,110 --> 05:47:45,590
Not quite.

1580
05:47:46,150 --> 05:47:48,439
We need a red or...

1581
05:47:48,439 --> 05:47:49,880
I could take the green out of this.

1582
05:47:49,880 --> 05:47:57,560
That'd be a poor color.

1583
05:47:57,560 --> 05:47:58,279
Yeah, that's good.

1584
05:47:58,279 --> 05:48:01,340
I still apparently have...

1585
05:48:01,340 --> 05:48:03,560
I didn't use all these keys.

1586
05:48:12,279 --> 05:48:15,349
I'll pay a pretty penny for that.

1587
05:48:15,349 --> 05:48:20,790
Okay, now the question becomes I have 100,000 gold.

1588
05:48:21,430 --> 05:48:25,900
I'm going to pull out the revolver.

1589
05:48:30,549 --> 05:48:31,349
What can we do here?

1590
05:48:31,909 --> 05:48:43,400
A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.

1591
05:48:52,549 --> 05:48:53,990
Try that on for size.

1592
05:48:53,990 --> 05:48:54,869
I've made my decision.

1593
05:48:55,509 --> 05:49:00,779
We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend.

1594
05:49:00,779 --> 05:49:03,099
This kind of work is about finesse.

1595
05:49:03,099 --> 05:49:03,900
I've made my choice.

1596
05:49:04,540 --> 05:49:06,700
A little bit goes a long way.

1597
05:49:07,419 --> 05:49:08,060
You'll see.

1598
05:49:08,860 --> 05:49:12,680
I'm going to max this out.

1599
05:49:13,400 --> 05:49:15,639
And I'm going to be so fucked up in the end.

1600
05:49:16,279 --> 05:49:18,040
Don't get yourself killed now.

1601
05:49:20,439 --> 05:49:21,639
I'm going to be so fucked up.

1602
05:49:22,520 --> 05:49:27,979
I'm going to have like 25 magnum shots and 50 shotgun shots

1603
05:49:27,979 --> 05:49:29,500
that are all going to come out in 10 seconds.

1604
05:49:30,060 --> 05:49:37,990
I could go up.

1605
05:49:37,990 --> 05:49:40,200
What is going up to?

1606
05:49:40,919 --> 05:49:42,330
What is...

1607
05:49:43,130 --> 05:49:43,770
What's up, Doug?

1608
05:49:44,330 --> 05:49:51,130
First aid spray.

1609
05:49:57,290 --> 05:49:58,250
What the fuck?

1610
05:49:58,250 --> 05:49:59,770
Oh, my God.

1611
05:50:00,250 --> 05:50:01,130
You got me.

1612
05:50:01,130 --> 05:50:01,770
Who got me?

1613
05:50:04,729 --> 05:50:07,909
Okay.

1614
05:50:07,909 --> 05:50:12,939
Actually, let me save it because I'll forget to do that again.

1615
05:50:12,939 --> 05:50:14,860
How's my eye twitching?

1616
05:50:22,069 --> 05:50:23,830
I have 15 saves.

1617
05:50:23,830 --> 05:50:24,869
I'm such a...

1618
05:50:24,869 --> 05:50:26,310
I save every two seconds.

1619
05:50:27,799 --> 05:50:29,080
No way I'd be able to ever do that.

1620
05:50:32,439 --> 05:50:33,880
This is dark Jerma today.

1621
05:50:33,880 --> 05:50:34,520
No, it's not.

1622
05:50:36,409 --> 05:50:37,930
I think this is pretty neutral.

1623
05:50:37,930 --> 05:50:38,650
No, I'm very...

1624
05:50:38,650 --> 05:50:39,130
This is...

1625
05:50:39,130 --> 05:50:39,849
I think this is...

1626
05:50:39,849 --> 05:50:41,209
This is definitely not dark Jerma.

1627
05:50:41,770 --> 05:50:44,150
No, you've seen dark Jerma before.

1628
05:51:00,500 --> 05:51:01,139
Here we go.

1629
05:51:02,360 --> 05:51:05,159
50 shots in this thing and they all come out in five seconds.

1630
05:51:07,049 --> 05:51:07,770
I got it.

1631
05:51:07,770 --> 05:51:10,090
48 shotgun bullets loaded.

1632
05:51:11,159 --> 05:51:12,759
And just because I want to know,

1633
05:51:13,400 --> 05:51:14,599
I want to know.

1634
05:51:14,599 --> 05:51:15,400
I want to see.

1635
05:51:18,630 --> 05:51:21,990
I want to time how long it takes to unload the whole thing.

1636
05:51:21,990 --> 05:51:22,790
I want to test it.

1637
05:51:23,430 --> 05:51:28,700
Okay.

1638
05:51:28,700 --> 05:51:29,340
Let's test it.

1639
05:51:39,020 --> 05:51:53,139
This thing is fucking crazy.

1640
05:52:01,939 --> 05:52:08,299
Oh, shit.

1641
05:52:08,299 --> 05:52:08,779
I'm out.

1642
05:52:09,340 --> 05:52:21,099
So I have to just open the...

1643
05:52:21,099 --> 05:52:23,419
You know, when like the eye opens or whatever,

1644
05:52:23,419 --> 05:52:26,939
just go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1645
05:52:26,939 --> 05:52:28,459
Do that like three times and I win.

1646
05:52:28,459 --> 05:52:34,139
Okay.

1647
05:52:34,139 --> 05:52:38,200
Let's go.

1648
05:52:38,200 --> 05:52:39,240
I want to...

1649
05:52:39,240 --> 05:52:41,639
Wait, let me load this because I upgraded it, didn't I?

1650
05:52:42,360 --> 05:52:51,799
You know what kind of stinks?

1651
05:52:52,599 --> 05:52:53,240
It's not a big deal.

1652
05:52:54,040 --> 05:52:57,080
I can't mouse scroll to the other weapon.

1653
05:52:57,080 --> 05:52:58,200
I have to press five.

1654
05:52:58,840 --> 05:53:04,569
Look at this thing.

1655
05:53:04,569 --> 05:53:09,369
20 shots in this thing.

1656
05:53:09,369 --> 05:53:10,250
It's middle click.

1657
05:53:15,240 --> 05:53:16,520
Oh, it is.

1658
05:53:17,240 --> 05:53:18,900
Okay.

1659
05:53:18,900 --> 05:53:19,299
Thank you.

1660
05:53:19,860 --> 05:53:23,459
Took me to the last third of the game to figure that out.

1661
05:53:33,900 --> 05:53:40,090
I've delivered the girl to you as promised.

1662
05:53:40,090 --> 05:53:46,729
Do tell our lord to not forget the loyalty of his servant, Ramon.

1663
05:53:46,729 --> 05:53:54,229
Ashley!

1664
05:53:59,720 --> 05:54:02,040
Such a fool, Mr. Genity.

1665
05:54:02,840 --> 05:54:05,880
To have been bestowed with lower subtleties.

1666
05:54:05,880 --> 05:54:06,840
You talk too much.

1667
05:54:06,840 --> 05:54:08,040
I get failed.

1668
05:54:09,959 --> 05:54:16,069
You vulgar, alien civilized mongrel.

1669
05:54:23,479 --> 05:54:26,119
Not the bubbling boss sound.

1670
05:54:28,340 --> 05:54:32,500
Not the bubbling sludge boss sound effect.

1671
05:55:11,799 --> 05:55:13,560
Hey, not fair RNG.

1672
05:55:13,560 --> 05:55:13,959
Look at that.

1673
05:55:28,490 --> 05:55:29,529
Just give me the go ahead.

1674
05:55:29,529 --> 05:55:31,450
Now I'm going to fucking unload on them.

1675
05:55:31,450 --> 05:55:34,979
Give me the go ahead.

1676
05:55:52,709 --> 05:55:53,430
Give me the green light.

1677
05:55:53,430 --> 05:55:54,150
Give me the green light.

1678
05:56:01,020 --> 05:56:01,520
Yeah.

1679
05:56:08,700 --> 05:56:10,220
What are you going to do, motherfucker?

1680
05:56:11,419 --> 05:56:12,779
What are you going to do about it?

1681
05:56:17,750 --> 05:56:21,000
Fucking go.

1682
05:56:21,639 --> 05:56:22,200
Let's go.

1683
05:56:24,919 --> 05:56:25,479
Let's go.

1684
05:56:26,580 --> 05:56:27,619
Cue the cut scene.

1685
05:56:28,180 --> 05:56:35,189
He didn't even get a chance to say half his lines.

1686
05:56:35,189 --> 05:56:47,900
And I still got half my bullets.

1687
05:56:47,900 --> 05:56:48,700
We're good.

1688
05:56:48,700 --> 05:56:54,490
It's so fucking stupid.

1689
05:56:54,490 --> 05:57:07,060
I made him come out of his shell like five times.

1690
05:57:07,060 --> 05:57:12,220
You just got clown makeup?

1691
05:57:12,220 --> 05:57:13,580
That was fucking fun.

1692
05:57:13,580 --> 05:57:14,939
I told you it was worth it.

1693
05:57:18,119 --> 05:57:19,220
All right.

1694
05:57:19,220 --> 05:57:22,220
That was fun.

1695
05:57:22,220 --> 05:57:23,259
I got everything in the room, right?

1696
05:57:23,259 --> 05:57:26,150
Let me just check.

1697
05:57:26,150 --> 05:57:26,790
No, I did not.

1698
05:57:26,790 --> 05:57:27,750
Just go around and look at this.

1699
05:57:27,750 --> 05:57:29,669
All these things that want to be to use.

1700
05:57:30,549 --> 05:57:31,349
What's in here?

1701
05:57:32,150 --> 05:57:33,189
Handgun ammo.

1702
05:57:33,189 --> 05:57:34,709
Oh, I ran out of ammo.

1703
05:57:34,709 --> 05:57:35,590
Craft.

1704
05:57:35,590 --> 05:57:35,990
What's this?

1705
05:57:37,020 --> 05:57:38,060
Oh, a bunch of gunpowder.

1706
05:57:38,619 --> 05:57:40,459
Make some more arrows.

1707
05:57:40,459 --> 05:57:41,659
Oh, I have to dodge that.

1708
05:57:41,659 --> 05:57:42,060
Shit.

1709
05:57:42,060 --> 05:57:54,970
Oh, I got hit.

1710
05:57:54,970 --> 05:57:59,880
Nice ego.

1711
05:57:59,880 --> 05:58:01,400
That was so funny.

1712
05:58:01,400 --> 05:58:03,000
I loved every second of that.

1713
05:58:03,000 --> 05:58:08,330
I think I cleared out everything.

1714
05:58:08,330 --> 05:58:08,810
Yep.

1715
05:58:08,810 --> 05:58:14,919
It probably would have been cheaper to buy an RPG

1716
05:58:14,919 --> 05:58:15,880
and just shoot him once.

1717
05:58:16,439 --> 05:58:19,990
It was the fun in that, though.

1718
05:58:20,549 --> 05:58:23,349
It is kind of fun, but you know.

1719
05:58:23,349 --> 05:58:25,720
Ashley, no time to lose.

1720
05:58:28,330 --> 05:58:34,549
Come on.

1721
05:58:34,549 --> 05:58:36,150
Let's start replenishing it.

1722
05:58:36,150 --> 05:58:47,299
Already almost there.

1723
05:58:47,860 --> 05:58:56,680
All right.

1724
05:58:56,680 --> 05:58:58,520
Next save point, I'm going to call it.

1725
05:58:58,520 --> 05:59:01,560
And then I'll give you the schedule for this coming week.

1726
05:59:08,500 --> 05:59:10,259
Still four chapters left.

1727
05:59:12,470 --> 05:59:24,169
Five chapters left.

1728
05:59:24,169 --> 05:59:24,569
16.

1729
05:59:24,569 --> 05:59:25,369
Wait, where are we?

1730
05:59:25,369 --> 05:59:26,970
Number 11 or 12.

1731
05:59:26,970 --> 05:59:28,090
We still have this Krauser.

1732
05:59:29,290 --> 05:59:31,610
There's at least two or three other encounters left.

1733
05:59:39,110 --> 05:59:39,669
First playthrough?

1734
05:59:39,669 --> 05:59:40,150
Nope.

1735
05:59:40,150 --> 05:59:41,830
This would be well of the remake.

1736
05:59:41,830 --> 05:59:46,569
Yeah, but this is probably the third or fourth time

1737
05:59:46,569 --> 05:59:48,009
I played through Resident Evil 4.

1738
05:59:48,729 --> 05:59:52,439
There is no.

1739
05:59:53,560 --> 05:59:58,439
Yeah, we still have the scary chapter or two.

1740
05:59:59,479 --> 06:00:01,560
There's at least two or three hours left still, at least.

1741
06:00:02,740 --> 06:00:03,779
Might even be like four.

1742
06:00:04,340 --> 06:00:06,069
So this would be another stream for sure.

1743
06:00:06,709 --> 06:00:08,099
Yeah, the lab.

1744
06:00:08,099 --> 06:00:10,340
Yeah, this is at least four plus hours.

1745
06:00:10,900 --> 06:00:33,529
Where is this hanging?

1746
06:00:33,529 --> 06:00:34,090
Did I miss it?

1747
06:00:34,090 --> 06:00:41,020
Yeah, still top 20.

1748
06:00:41,020 --> 06:00:41,900
Yeah, I would say.

1749
06:00:42,459 --> 06:00:48,700
I mean, the Resident Evil 4 video game is definitely top 20, top 25 games of all time.

1750
06:00:48,700 --> 06:00:52,569
I failed you, my lord.

1751
06:00:52,569 --> 06:00:54,490
I was unable to fulfill your final commandment

1752
06:00:54,490 --> 06:00:56,810
and keep the boy from the path of wickedness.

1753
06:00:56,810 --> 06:01:03,159
Got a glimpse of Master Ramon's evil temperament during his younger years.

1754
06:01:03,159 --> 06:01:06,950
When he discovered a servant mocked him by uttering,

1755
06:01:06,950 --> 06:01:09,110
Pull Garcito behind his back.

1756
06:01:09,110 --> 06:01:11,189
He summoned her to his private chambers.

1757
06:01:11,189 --> 06:01:13,049
After forcing her to kneel before him,

1758
06:01:13,049 --> 06:01:17,779
Ramon doused her face with a vial of vitriol he pulled out of his pocket.

1759
06:01:21,110 --> 06:01:25,750
The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed in agony as the skin melted

1760
06:01:25,750 --> 06:01:26,790
from her face.

1761
06:01:26,790 --> 06:01:29,270
His twisted grin still haunts my dreams to this day.

1762
06:01:29,270 --> 06:01:32,229
As time passed, Ramon's treachery only deepened

1763
06:01:32,229 --> 06:01:36,409
and that infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his vulnerable heart.

1764
06:01:36,409 --> 06:01:37,290
Curse the fiends!

1765
06:01:39,380 --> 06:01:42,419
They've manipulated Master Ramon and turned him into their puppet.

1766
06:01:42,419 --> 06:01:45,380
Worst of all, they've managed to use him to unleash his pagas

1767
06:01:45,380 --> 06:01:49,930
that the Salazar family has fought so long and hard to keep sealed away.

1768
06:01:49,930 --> 06:01:54,490
Lord Diego, first assured I intend to watch over Master Ramon until the very end.

1769
06:01:54,490 --> 06:01:56,650
Whatever fate may be foul us.

1770
06:01:56,650 --> 06:01:59,700
As a faithful servant of the Salazar family since birth,

1771
06:01:59,700 --> 06:02:01,779
it is my duty and my penance to you.

1772
06:02:15,450 --> 06:02:18,069
Perfect. Won't have to swim after all.

1773
06:02:18,069 --> 06:02:22,389
Yeah, next save point I'm gonna call it.

1774
06:02:23,110 --> 06:02:38,540
What's the worst feeling texture?

1775
06:02:40,150 --> 06:02:41,700
Damn it.

1776
06:02:41,700 --> 06:02:42,200
Chalkboard.

1777
06:02:43,939 --> 06:02:52,119
Yeah, there it is.

1778
06:02:52,119 --> 06:03:04,069
Okay, no thanks bro.

1779
06:03:04,630 --> 06:03:07,349
Defeat five enemies with the iron balls.

1780
06:03:08,150 --> 06:03:10,060
Increase your maximum health to the limit.

1781
06:03:10,060 --> 06:03:10,560
Cool.

1782
06:03:13,080 --> 06:03:15,419
And that is it.

1783
06:03:17,110 --> 06:03:17,830
Thanks for watching.

1784
06:03:18,970 --> 06:03:20,729
We are at chapter 13.

1785
06:03:22,069 --> 06:03:23,509
There are three chapters left.

1786
06:03:23,509 --> 06:03:25,990
Each of these will probably be about an hour and a half or so hour.

1787
06:03:27,049 --> 06:03:29,209
Sounds like this is about three or four hours plus.

1788
06:03:29,209 --> 06:03:30,490
It's about maybe one more stream.

1789
06:03:30,490 --> 06:03:31,689
Maybe do some more side content.

1790
06:03:32,889 --> 06:03:35,049
Also unlocking the other stuff after beating the game.

1791
06:03:35,909 --> 06:03:39,590
Which should be fun to play for like an hour or two.

1792
06:03:39,590 --> 06:03:40,229
So here's the deal.

1793
06:03:41,259 --> 06:03:44,180
The next time you'll see me live will probably be...

1794
06:03:44,819 --> 06:03:48,680
It's 1 a.m. Holy shit.

1795
06:03:48,680 --> 06:03:49,159
Let's see.

1796
06:03:50,119 --> 06:03:55,930
Probably Wednesday.

1797
06:03:55,930 --> 06:03:59,080
Maybe we'll do Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.

1798
06:03:59,400 --> 06:04:03,849
We'll finish Resident Evil 4 on Wednesday.

1799
06:04:03,849 --> 06:04:12,500
And then we will go to Breath of the Wild on Thursday or Friday.

1800
06:04:12,500 --> 06:04:14,630
Something like that.

1801
06:04:14,630 --> 06:04:20,340
So I'll see you in a couple days.

1802
06:04:20,340 --> 06:04:23,930
The games, like I said, last time, the last two streams.

1803
06:04:23,930 --> 06:04:24,650
It's great.

1804
06:04:24,650 --> 06:04:25,299
It's just great.

1805
06:04:25,299 --> 06:04:27,619
It's great to play this again and just pre-experience it.

1806
06:04:27,619 --> 06:04:29,720
It's fantastic.

1807
06:04:29,720 --> 06:04:40,139
I love it.

1808
06:04:40,139 --> 06:04:43,180
Thanks again.

1809
06:04:43,180 --> 06:04:44,540
Wednesday, probably around the same time.

1810
06:04:44,540 --> 06:04:46,220
Probably around six o'clock Pacific.

1811
06:04:46,220 --> 06:04:59,799
Let me just get out of here.

1812
06:04:59,799 --> 06:05:00,439
Okay.

1813
06:05:00,439 --> 06:05:03,580
I need to exit the game.

1814
06:05:03,580 --> 06:05:13,419
There we go.

1815
06:05:13,419 --> 06:05:14,060
There we are.

1816
06:05:14,060 --> 06:05:24,490
All right, because I gotta get the music on.

1817
06:05:24,490 --> 06:05:27,049
I'll give you a dollar if you keep playing.

1818
06:05:27,049 --> 06:05:29,209
Well, I'm gonna keep playing, just not tonight.

1819
06:05:29,209 --> 06:05:30,599
On Wednesday.

1820
06:05:30,599 --> 06:05:42,520
A couple days.

1821
06:05:42,520 --> 06:05:43,400
A dollar?

1822
06:05:43,400 --> 06:05:48,889
What about two dollars?

1823
06:05:48,889 --> 06:06:02,619
No, I'll give you a dollar oh one.

1824
06:06:02,619 --> 06:06:04,060
Keep slaying, Queens.

1825
06:06:05,180 --> 06:06:09,560
This man just scammed an innocent viewer.

1826
06:06:13,220 --> 06:06:14,900
That proposition was said to me.

1827
06:06:15,619 --> 06:06:17,860
And I said that I would be playing it again.

1828
06:06:18,659 --> 06:06:20,259
Hey, hey, watch out.

1829
06:06:20,259 --> 06:06:24,259
You gotta make sure you ask the right question.

1830
06:06:24,259 --> 06:06:24,819
He didn't say.

1831
06:06:25,909 --> 06:06:27,990
I'll give you a dollar to continue playing tonight.

1832
06:06:28,069 --> 06:06:29,110
Said continue playing.

1833
06:06:29,669 --> 06:06:37,290
I would choose your words more carefully next time.

1834
06:06:37,290 --> 06:06:37,770
Loki.

1835
06:06:43,590 --> 06:06:44,549
All right, good night.

1836
06:06:44,549 --> 06:06:45,430
See you later.

1837
06:06:45,430 --> 06:06:46,470
Call your mother.

1838
06:06:46,470 --> 06:06:47,990
Take care of yourselves.

1839
06:06:47,990 --> 06:06:49,110
Have a good rest of your,

1840
06:06:49,110 --> 06:06:51,110
what is left of your weekend, maybe some of you.

1841
06:06:53,619 --> 06:06:54,819
See you Wednesday.

1842
06:06:54,819 --> 06:06:57,419
Take it easy, guys.
