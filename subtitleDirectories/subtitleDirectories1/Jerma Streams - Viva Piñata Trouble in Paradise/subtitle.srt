00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,289
Hi. So I'm realizing the tweet that I just put out, uh, sounds kind of weird.

2
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:16,460
Relaxing for a bit with some stuffed animals. Like, am I just lying on my bed,

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,359
camera pointed at me, with like all of my stuffed animal friends?

4
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:28,140
Anyways, hi guys. Welcome back.

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:41,880
Kinda. Welcome back. Kinda. I am not moved. I mean, I'm in the process.

6
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,850
Uh, I actually haven't really had a moment to sit down until right now.

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:59,609
It was like the first time I've sat down, unless I was in bed sleeping in about six days, five days.

8
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,810
You can, hey, you can hear the rumor. That's how you know.

9
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:10,540
But I just sat in this room. It was all bullshit. I'm just, you know, I'm not going anywhere.

10
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:21,879
He lied about canceling streaming. Wait, what? I 100% guaranteed there'd be a stream today.

11
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:26,120
It was one. I mean, you cannot go back on a 100% guarantee.

12
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,000
Hey, you get yourself in some trouble. What do you mean you banned that guy?

13
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,010
Oh, right. I was supposed to ban somebody. That's right. I'm sorry. I've been all over the place.

14
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,209
Uh, these last five days, someone's going to get banned. They said, ban me if you do, right?

15
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:47,079
You remember their name? Yeah. They were like, there's no way you're streaming on Saturday.

16
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,840
I fucking guarantee it. Otherwise ban me, dickhead or something, right? So ban that person, I guess.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,920
Uh, turtle toenail just gave 5,000 bits. We haven't even started.

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,480
I wouldn't give me any money before I tell you what the plan is. You know what I'm saying?

19
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,379
Like, let me just be really honest with you. Uh, okay. Let me give you the plan first before

20
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,979
anybody's like, he's back. All right, let's there. There we go. He's back.

21
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:15,780
Let's talk about, let's go over the plan first. Uh, anyways, thanks for the huge money though.

22
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:25,960
Seriously. That's 5,000 bits. Appreciate it. I'm turtle toenail. They say, hey, you, you, do you,

23
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:35,340
hey, do you got a Mitch Hedberg? Oh, do I have a Mitch Hedberg impression? Oh, I was like, what?

24
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,819
Uh, it's kind of, Mitch Hedberg is kind of hard to do. He's fucking legendary comedian.

25
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:49,639
Um, Mitch Hedberg is kind of like this. He talks about, why the Pringles? No, I can't do it.

26
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:54,759
I got it. Maybe a little bit. Uh, the answer is no. Uh, he's a legendary fucking comedian.

27
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,120
Some of the funniest shit ever. I can't. I'll do an impression of Mitch Hedberg. I tried.

28
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,479
Look, if somebody's all right, I'm seeing a lot of minus twos. If somebody's going to give me

29
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:14,219
$50 to attempt an impression, what am I going to say? No. All right. Thanks for the $50. Uh,

30
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:22,680
you know, I don't think I feel like saying one sentence for $50. Come on, man. Come on, Gwen.

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:33,189
I can, I can, I see some, come on, wins here, please. You know what I mean? Why is nobody

32
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:37,349
doing it? Oh fuck. I forgot pre-stream chat is not every single person that watches this channel.

33
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:49,960
Sorry. I, I seriously like forget that. Anyways, uh, so here's the deal. Here's the deal. Uh,

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,580
there's been a lot of, it's been slow going. Let's just put it that way.

35
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,469
And it's going to take a lot longer than initially anticipated to actually move.

36
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,969
So because of all the coronavirus stuff and social distancing and all that shit, we're trying to do

37
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,210
this right. And we're trying to do it in a way that we're all comfortable and everything. So

38
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:21,990
we're not really ready yet, but we are, but we aren't. So, uh, streams for the next few days,

39
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,509
I'm going to be streaming, but they're only going to be three to four hours each for the next few

40
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,980
days. This is temporary until all this is kind of get where we need to be. You know what I mean?

41
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,569
So that's the way it is. So hold off on your, on your, on your $50 donations.

42
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,269
Fuck somebody already did it right. So we're going to do, we're going to relax. I haven't really had

43
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,189
a time to relax. I've been, I have, like I said, I haven't stopped moving. So we're going to play

44
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:53,750
Viva Piñata, uh, trouble in paradise is the one that everyone wanted me to play. Here comes the

45
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:09,290
hype train. Why don't you just try moving harder? It won't be that easy. But, uh, anyways, let's get

46
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,209
going. We're going to play Viva Piñata, trouble in paradise. Jerma sucks gave 10 community subs.

47
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:20,259
This guy sucks. Well, not you, me. Cause that's what you're referring to. So short streams over

48
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:27,779
the next few days. Um, we'll get back to normal here soon. I promise, but not immediately. Not

49
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:35,720
immediately. Here it is. So this is the good one, right? This is the one that everybody wanted me

50
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:50,300
to play. This is, this is the good one. You don't have an active gamer profile. Yeah, I do. What

51
00:05:50,379 --> 00:06:19,610
are you talking about? No, I don't care about Xbox live. When you change a gamer profile,

52
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,329
you be returned to the title screen. Enjoy your time with Viva Piñata. Trouble in paradise.

53
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:31,860
Like your message. I'm not going to fucking do that. I don't care. Cause I haven't like paid

54
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:45,100
for Xbox live in probably like nine months or something. I already did this. Oh no. I'm saying

55
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:51,819
I don't, I don't have it. I don't own Xbox live right now. I, I consolidated all my subscription

56
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:56,709
services. What does it give me a warning for? The auto save. Yeah. There's a big donut in the

57
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:06,040
middle. Another 5,000 bits just came in. Uh, you missed my pre-stream bits, but they're irrelevant

58
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:17,209
now due to the poll being closed. Thanks for the 5,000 fucking bits dude. Seriously. If you were,

59
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:22,329
I was here like three hours ago, just checking in. I'm not even going to say this because the

60
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:28,490
votes are over and I'm not going to cause a fight in chat. Long story short, Nancy Drew was on that

61
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:38,759
list and it had 6% of the whole vote and a lot of people were angry. How many times do I have to

62
00:07:38,759 --> 00:08:00,360
pick? Do I really care about this? Yes. I'm aware that that is a name of somebody that I've

63
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:10,230
potentially made up in the chat. Okay. I don't just, what the fuck do I care? Chat will never

64
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:18,810
forget. This is my, no, I'm changing it, but what if I, just be careful. What if like who's David?

65
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,199
I don't fucking know. I probably made that name when I was drunk or this is a used Xbox 360 console.

66
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,790
That could be like some other person's account or something. I don't know. I don't remember.

67
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:43,059
I don't remember. I don't know. Stolen. No, it's not. I made it or something. I don't know. I can't.

68
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:51,580
I have no idea. I cannot tell you the real reason why it's just there. All right. How do I, hold on.

69
00:08:51,580 --> 00:09:01,190
What should I name this? This is a stolen Xbox. I didn't fucking steal this Xbox.

70
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:09,539
It didn't steal it. I purchased it. God damn it. I purchased it. I purchased it.

71
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:17,210
Prove it. People, you want me to show you the receipt from when I bought this Xbox 360.

72
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:27,289
Guys, that receipt went into the trash. What do you want me to say? Do you think I held on to the

73
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:38,700
Xbox 360 refurbished receipt? This thing was like $44. No, I think this thing was like $38.

74
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:56,919
That's irresponsible. For tax purposes. I don't know. You want to write off the 360?

75
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,740
All right. Fine. I'll go get the receipt and I'll write off the 360 for you. Okay.

76
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:13,100
Look, I've got a CPA that takes care of this for me. Jeremy, did you itemize that fucking 360?

77
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,110
No, I don't care. Want me to throw it in the trash? I'll just open the trash. I've not dropped

78
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,659
the fucking thing into the trash. No, I wouldn't do that. I would fucking donate it. Stop. Anyways,

79
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:26,419
what's the name of the garden? What's the name of the garden? Anybody got a name for the garden?

80
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:50,809
David's garden. David's garden. Well, I don't, I don't. I've missed you guys. It's been like five

81
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:59,320
days. I've missed you guys. David, wait, where's the, where's the little symbol that shows possession?

82
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,980
Okay, there we go. Put it on the hard drive. Oh, finally we can get past the fucking main menu.

83
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,620
Great gardeners can make their piñatas candy-o-city meter full and piñatas at full

84
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,259
candy-o-city are much more valuable. So this, you say this one's much better than the last one.

85
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:43,370
Why? Why is this one better than the last one? Extra, extra sweet? It's the same fucking game.

86
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:52,549
Oh. I just love fireworks. Oh, get away. This is my moment.

87
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,139
Okay. It's been like five days since I said that.

88
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,350
No such thing as a simple hacking technique. It's all incredibly detailed code and shit.

89
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,269
I hate when people fucking say that, by the way. As a fucking coder myself,

90
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:34,200
that's so fucking irritating.

91
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:54,259
Is this a bit? Hold on. You can't tell if me saying that I'm a coder is real or not.

92
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,220
There's absolutely no way I know that's accurate.

93
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:11,350
Um, no, I don't know anything about code. In fact, I tried a long time ago and it was a

94
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,149
disaster. Seriously fucking impossible. It's like one of the most detailed,

95
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:28,179
most difficult skills in the world. Okay. Let's open up the menu. This is the garden. Oh,

96
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:33,940
it's just like the last one. We're gonna, here comes the same stream we did with different animals.

97
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:42,970
This is gonna be, we're gonna get introduced to all the weird bugs and

98
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,129
foxes. It's a rerun.

99
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,490
Hey, at least the garden is done. I don't have to like do any bullshit.

100
00:13:55,289 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh, you can take pictures in this one. Oh, wait, we already get a frog too? Holy shit.

101
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:16,149
Wow. Okay. What do you want me to do? Make a flower?

102
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:22,330
Okay, so if we read this, this is a bispati.

103
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:03,700
and lacquerate spots, and those eyelashes just don't naturally curl like that, you know.

104
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,710
Okay, must be a maximum candy-osity.

105
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,870
Okay, you can get your pinatas ready for their trip in a

106
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,389
cano, can, canonata by feeding them. This is a lot, this is not the same game.

107
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,840
Nobody said, feel good ink laugh.

108
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:05,860
Find the many ways that you can increase a pinata's candy-osity meter and then send it off to a party.

109
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,009
All right, how do we fill the candy, what, you have to like dress it up in clogs?

110
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:20,149
All right, we, we need a flower. That's what he wants, right?

111
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,789
Somebody make that? Yeah, I'm sure somebody will. Don't worry, give them like five minutes.

112
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:36,710
It's like the bug with your cursor. Information button. All right, we need a flower, right?

113
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:42,169
Have three poppies in the garden and that will bring a bispati in.

114
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:55,179
Move the cursor into the garden and open up the menu and put a flower.

115
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,259
All right, so where should I put these? I know people are gonna scream at me.

116
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,700
I'm gonna get screamed at for doing this wrong.

117
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,319
You have some lovely poppies. Somebody already made it.

118
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,599
If you put the cursor on a bispati and press Y, you can find out what it means to stay in your garden.

119
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,559
How the fuck have you already done this? You need at least like five minutes to upload

120
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:25,859
the video to YouTube. It's impossible. Are we doing animal crossing tonight? No, we are not

121
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:32,019
because during the process of the move and packing and getting bought, Kim has been playing animal

122
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:38,259
crossing each night because it's one thing that we can like do. So that is currently in the

123
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:46,980
occupation of Kim. They cannot play animal crossing. It's been commandeered. Oh, we have

124
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,420
lovely flowers. If you put the cursor on the bispati and press Y, you can find out what it needs.

125
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:03,420
So we need three of them, right? Oh, he's here. Okay, cool. So it wants three of these. Oops.

126
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:13,579
What did I just do? Wait, can I plant this? Wait, there are already three in here, aren't there?

127
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:21,720
There's one, two, only two. Do I have to buy this shit or can I plant this? Kim stream. Kim stream.

128
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:32,329
She's not here. This dude is a simp. What? Hold on. Let me get this straight. So because

129
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,029
my girlfriend is currently occupying the Nintendo Switch during the potential downtime of a move,

130
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:54,150
that makes me a simp. Is that what we're understanding here? I don't know what that

131
00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:06,299
word really means. Simp meme is already dead. Give it a rest. All right. Yeah. Give it a rest.

132
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,900
That's a dead meme according to that one guy. That's a one guy moment. All right. So how do

133
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:27,529
let's wait. What? Oh, fuck. There's another one. I remember these guys. Well done. You attracted

134
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:35,910
a world. Good soil. Oh shit. Here they come again. This is part two snakes and worms and bugs.

135
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:50,440
Okay. Some grass. All right. What do you need? You need

136
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,619
three poppies in the garden. All right. And I got to buy a poppy.

137
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:05,880
Shovel. So would you just dig a hole? Does it matter where? Hey, hey, hey, get away from there.

138
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:14,309
Get away from that. Don't eat that. I'll just. Can I put it on? How close can they be?

139
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:27,180
Just dig it. Just do it wherever. Let's do it right here. Okay. I'm going to put a poppy, right?

140
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:37,740
Oh, that's a poppy right there. Don't ignore the story. There is no story. It's invite a bunch of

141
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:46,980
fucking stuffed animals over your house for a few hours. That's the game. Menu. Now I can get the

142
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:59,799
watering can. You're missing the lore. You make up your own lore when it comes to stuffed animals.

143
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,000
As I used to sit in my bedroom with a dozen stuffed animals and make up TV shows with them.

144
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,200
That was my lore with them. I can do whatever I can say, whatever I want with these guys.

145
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,130
All right. That's good. So now it's going to grow and that will that guy will stay. So I have good

146
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,339
grass, right? What do you, what does this say? What do you need? How do you, how do I get you to be a

147
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:28,869
resident? Let's see. Okay. You have two square, uh, penometers of grass has eaten a mouse mallow.

148
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:36,920
All right. I need a mouse mallow. He wasn't a kid. That was last week. I mean, that's kind of accurate

149
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,450
if you think about it. All right. Get that poppy to grow. What are you? Are you, are you a resident

150
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:54,220
here? Romance has eaten one green flutterscotch. Okay. Wait for the bug to reside. But how long

151
00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:06,059
does the flower take? These things remind me of a toad. This is a fucking toad. I don't want these

152
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:17,849
things. Let them out. Well, I don't know. I'm not letting the frog out. This is my only friend.

153
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,609
I only have one friend and it's this toad. Max candy-osity hint. Okay.

154
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:50,490
Okay. This is a new thing. This is different. Candy-osity award for being a resident. What do

155
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,569

156
00:22:54,569 --> 00:23:05,670
candy-osity meter. New resident, new resident. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, look, it's kind of cool looking.

157
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:17,130
Okay. So and rename this potty. What should we rename this? Toad. I mean, I did just say it. So

158
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:37,430
why don't we just do it? It's 7 40 a.m. I don't know. Do you think I ever set the date and time

159
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:48,460
on this Xbox? Never. Wherever David lived is where this is probably set to. All right. This is the

160
00:23:48,460 --> 00:24:04,970
house, right? Cognata at full candy-osity. Okay. So now it's like you pack item. Wait, I'm packing

161
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:18,230
this? What am I doing? I just disintegrated them. Wait, where are you going? Am I harvesting this guy?

162
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:27,140
Congratulations. You've completed the first challenge by successful. All right. So we,

163
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:36,200
we gonzo the graded into where? That wasn't too hard, was it? Now let's try something a bit more

164
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:46,779
tricky. Oh, you. So is that the point of trouble in paradise? As you make them really happy and

165
00:24:46,779 --> 00:25:00,470
then you fire them out of a cannon to a party. You sent them to the glue factory. Oh my god.

166
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:12,230
You fucking psycho. All right. Anyways, candy. So we have to make them really happy and then send

167
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:25,130
them to the, to the party, to the party in quotes. God damn it. Oh, why did you have to say that?

168
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:33,690
Langston. Okay. Bring them back alive. I've got a request from someone having a beach party.

169
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,700
They want a sandy pinata. So I suggest you go to the desert area and trap a sweetle.

170
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:47,960
Follow the cursor and we'll soon have this one done. Ooh. Jeremy's garden. When you're here,

171
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:59,529
you're family. Okay. So we've got to get a, a sweetle. Oh, sorry. I just read that. That was,

172
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,849
that was not even my joke. Uh, that was a bit joke. I just read it. I just stole it. I'm going

173
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,890
to make sure I give credit. That was potion dwellers said that that was a stolen joke and

174
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:14,039
I want to make sure I give credit for it. Oh, and now everyone changes to plus two. That's really

175
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:23,900
funny. That's very, very interesting, by the way. When the sun goes down, look for a suitable

176
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:33,339
garden moth drop more. Oh, it's a pretz tail. I had a couple of these before they're hard to

177
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:46,500
manage though. They eat everybody. It's on his ear. The tag has appeared. They like to investigate

178
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,849
a garden in the dark. Okay. Here comes another one. All right. Select the desert. You can go to

179
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:58,680
multiple parks. All right. Where are we going? Is it the desert? The desert dessert, the dessert

180
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,630
desert. What? I don't know why it is red. Do you want to follow the shitpost to the desert?

181
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:20,119
Sure. I would not follow a shitpost map. You'd end up, you'd have been like fucking another country.

182
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:44,539
Oh, there it is. A sweetle, right? First sighting of a sweetle. How do I get them?

183
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:52,740
Yurt bag. Okay. Let's see. We have to bait, put bait down. Oh, again, selling traps is my

184
00:27:52,740 --> 00:28:05,430
sideline. And to help you along, you can have a freebie. Wait, he talks? Wait a minute. This is

185
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:25,960
one of the squid billies. Bucky feel. I can tell. It was the frog. Okay. Place the item. I have more

186
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,039
than one. This is kind of cool. I like this. I get to manage more than one right in the corner.

187
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:36,380
Make sure it's perfect or I'll delete my fucking whole account on Twitch. I use that too often.

188
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,910
You know what I mean? That carries no weight anymore. I say that like every four or five days.

189
00:28:41,910 --> 00:29:01,130
That doesn't carry any weight anymore. Bait trap. Have we been alert? Okay. How do we use it?

190
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:26,519
We need new material. I'm not sure I do. Think about it. All right. We've got to put bait on here.

191
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:38,170
Yams? How many yams do I have? Oh, you just buy one. Okay. That's good. Right. Wait for the

192
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,380
trap to catch the... All right. How do we... Is he just going to walk the whole perimeter?

193
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:54,279
I probably should have put this a lot closer. Not all the way across the whole thing.

194
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:13,609
Go get it. Why don't you go eat one of those yams? Come on. Make a trail of yams. Let's know. That's

195
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:21,130
a waste of money. This one's going for it. Here we go. Geki. I want one of these. I want one of these

196
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:36,940
so bad. You can only find the Geki in the desert. You can only find the Geki in the desert.

197
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:50,809
I'm just going to say that's an ugly piece of shit lizard. What is wrong with you? Look at him. He's

198
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:56,869
perfect. I want you. How do I get you? Okay. A Geki finds it hard to resist a delicate snow drop

199
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:12,390
flower. I want one. All right. We need a snow drop flower. How do I get one? I want it. I

200
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:21,750
want it now. I want that Geki. I will get you a golden goose when we get home there, darling.

201
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:41,579
I want that one, daddy. Mr. Wonka. How much for the golden Geki? It's not for sale. Come on. Will

202
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:57,029
somebody eat this? Somebody please. Not today, son. Do the whole movie. I can't do the whole movie.

203
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,000
Somebody eat this yam. Look at this party. Is this the party they were talking about? Look at how

204
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,470
much fun they're having. Oh, I need you. I need to have you forever. Somebody eat this.

205
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:35,430
Look at this party. They don't even need music. Hey. All right. Can I direct you over here?

206
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:54,329
You. Scared? No. Why do I feel like this is exactly, this is exactly the shit that happens

207
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:59,450
if you go to a doggy daycare. This is exactly how they all act. This is why I walked back and

208
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:07,480
forth like 10 times. I'm going to go around the edge of a whole building 50 times. Who's

209
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,609
that over there? I don't know. Who are you? Let me see. No. I'll go this way instead.

210
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,220
This is doggy daycare. And then there's usually one just chewing on a bone over in the corner

211
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:42,650
all day. Somebody eat this. All right. Do I have to make another one? Oh God. Okay. Move. Wait.

212
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:50,630
What are you doing? What are they doing? The party's over. Party's over. Apparently. What?

213
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,529
Everybody scram. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

214
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:09,880
God damn it. How did I fuck this up? What happened? This is free, right?

215
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:18,010
You scared them. All right. Where the fuck is one of these things?

216
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't know. So did I soft lock myself in the tutorial for a game for five year olds?

217
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:56,920
I think I did. I'm fucked. I think I really am. Please come back. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

218
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:24,869
I want one daddy. All right. All right. All right. All right. Put one down. Look. Go eat it.

219
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,400
Go get over here. Why are they not even coming inside the circle?

220
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:49,849
Only one is brave enough to come back after the party pooper. Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

221
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm sorry. I take back everything I said about doggy daycare. If that was, if that was like a,

222
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,079
if that was like a begging strip on the ground, a hundred dogs are running after that.

223
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:16,780
Like, come on. I was incorrect. Get it. Yes. You've eaten. Now you're with friends.

224
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,590
Oh, what I meant to say was, um, got you.

225
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:32,170
Return to the main garden and visit the post office to unpack your trap.

226
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:51,050
I have to send this animal through the mail and that wicked fucked up. You're evil. I'm not even

227
00:36:51,050 --> 00:37:12,070
evil. Oh, there's Fanny Franker. You know, passing stuff on, getting some goodies off other Xbox live

228
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:20,260
gardeners doesn't exist anymore. Sorry. All right. Ooh. The trap has triggered.

229
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,389
And now we have to put, just put it anywhere. It doesn't matter.

230
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:35,000
The post office. There's no Xbox live guys. Howdy sweet pea. Welcome to the post office.

231
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,199
I heard there was a new face in town. We can help you with crate sales, crate delivery,

232
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:46,900
messages, invites. You just holler when you've made up your mind. Anybody else like this is

233
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:53,059
a nightmare person. Like, don't you see in a nightmare, the flap going up and down

234
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,579

235
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:12,920
while it's fucking running after you. It's fucking terrifying. Deliver this crate to me.

236
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:22,500
Sleep around. So does it matter where I put this? Right in the corner. All right. If I then,

237
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:32,420
you know what I'm saying? Unpack. Move out of the crate. Ooh, there you go.

238
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:44,300
Why is that? Why is it saying my name up there? You have a new sweet old visitor. Congratulations

239
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:53,719

00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:59,239
fucking mothership flying over us right now? What is going on? What's the fucking, oh, okay.

241
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:11,800
It really is a mothership. You have one square penometer of sand or you need sand.

242
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,460
So I see you've got a sand critter. Might be just the right time to give you this

243
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,929
sand packet. It works just like the grass packets and you can find it in the same place on the menu.

244
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:30,679
So there should be no problem for you to use. Okay. Cool. Sand packet. So he just needs one

245
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:38,760
little meter of sand. Short grass sand. Okay. Let's do a right in the corner.

246
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:52,820
This is going to be your little house. What's the snail doing over here? Get out of here.

247
00:39:54,019 --> 00:40:03,559
Why does this guy always do shit in the corners? Cause you build out. Oh, okay. That was relax.

248
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:19,579
Relax. Um, okay. I need to change that. Um, no, no, I'm not going to do,

249
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:27,820
I am not going to do medical textbook penis for, no, I'm sorry. I'm not, it has to change.

That's better. Okay. Are you happy here? Fucking unfollowed. Okay. Sorry. All right. Select.

00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:12,550
Go over here. Look, he's my friend. Apologize. I'm sorry. I said it. I know that wasn't a real

252
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,789
fault. That was it. I'm sorry. I'm saying this because you're making me. I know. But look,

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Yes, I did. All right. Has eaten one turnip.

255
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,420
I have a sweet little house in the garden. Okay. This is bad. Romance. What does he want me to do?

256
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:55,699
Select and do what? What do you want me to do? Direct it to where? What do you want me to do?

257
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:10,679
He's blind. Am I blind? Oh, read the instructions.

258
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:28,889
Read. I'm trying to. Oh, so that he's done with the party. Okay. Cool. It's not enough to.

259
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:43,670
It's not. Now stop. Oh, didn't I already do this though? I thought I already did this. Oh,

mothership returns. All right. Now I can replace this, right? Eat. I need to build a house for you.

262
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:10,949
He's eaten one turnip. You need to eat turnips. No, I'm shipping this guy off.

263
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:38,460
It's ready to party. All right. It's time to party. Turnips have feelings.

264
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:00,949
It's like the future of Amazon package delivery.

265
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,179
All right. Time for a challenge. One more.

266
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,340
A bouncing baby piñata. There's going to be a baby shower. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

267
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,969
Romance two piñatas. I will do that. I remember how to do it. Do you still have to do the mini

268
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:39,110
game from like the last one? Okay. You've leveled up. You filled the petals around the clock,

which means you've taken a step closer to becoming a truly great gardener. He remembers.

270
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:50,230
All kinds of things happen when you become a better gardener. Costalot store has opened. You

271
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:56,869
can buy some paving, some fences, a couple of items to decorate your garden with, and some seeds.

272
00:44:56,869 --> 00:45:04,090
Oh, that guy. The guy that you hit with the shovel, right? New piñata spotted. Where?

273
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:11,860
All right. So these two need to, um, come here, come here, come here. Stop. What are you going?

274
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:20,500
Where are you going? I need, they need a house to have romance. Stop flying around.

275
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,699
He's like got a cursor underneath him. Like he's going to drop. Like what are you doing?

276
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:39,980
Is that your firing cursor? Well, there's a crab. It's not a giant crab. It's a regular sized crab.

277
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:52,659
Everybody relax. Beach party animals. I love what they want. They're beach party animals.

278
00:45:52,659 --> 00:46:04,860
So there is sand over here. Sand and sunshine. Okay. All right. Come here. You, you too.

279
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:10,659
Actually, no, I need to see what it takes. I need to eat a daisy and we need a bespotty

280
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:31,639
house in the garden to make a bespotty house. Oh, there he is. I see. Cool. All right. There's,

281
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:39,320
there's no reason ever any human ever on any fucking circumstance. He's obsessed with gathering

282
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,590
seeds. Go like this. Talking to him. This is, that's like the Nosferatu fucking Dracula like

283
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:50,789
hands. Like what, there's no reason to anyone do that. If you do this, that you, that the, I,

284
00:46:50,789 --> 00:47:00,739
I get away from me. Like that's universal. Like nobody fucking does that. You're in the same house.

285
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:16,969
Yeah. I told you. I'm not in a different place. It didn't move. It was all a ruse from day one.

286
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:25,420
All right. Let's talk to Acidos. That's pre-recorded. I can prove to you this is not

287
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:36,599
pre-recorded. Okay. Oh! Like would I be able to time that perfectly? Oh! No, no way. Today is,

288
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:42,840
it's, it's March 28th at 4 15 PM. March 28th, 4 15 PM. March 28th, 4 15 PM. That would have been

289
00:47:42,840 --> 00:48:06,199
really fucking hard for me to do that. Pull out a newspaper. Pull out a newspaper. You're assuming

290
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:15,769
that anybody has newspapers anymore. Oh, there he is. Acidos. I'm Acidos. Take a seat and don't

291
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:29,239
hit me with your spade. Oh man. I remember this guy. Oh, we have a worm resident. I wish I put

292
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:35,320
the sprayer. It's like there's already dirt here. It's perfect. No, I want the shovel.

293
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:45,980
You have improved again. Lottie has some new items in her store including only eight more

294
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:54,789
levels. That's kind of a long way to go. All right. Let's plant this like right here.

295
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:14,900
Let's get out of my way before you make me angry. What kind of plan is this? Attack him. I'm not

296
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:25,579
going to attack him. Oh, a sparrow mint. So how many, how many Pokemons are in this game?

297
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:37,289
How many like actually exist in the game? Oh, they can hear the worms. All right. I'm going to

298
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:46,099
start to, I'm going to start to do some builds here. Kill him. I'm not going to, you can't kill

299
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:52,409
anybody. Oh, there's another one. Let's plant this right next to each other. This is a daisy.

300
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:59,909
Somebody has to eat a daisy, don't they? You can't kill anybody, guys. Why does everything have to be

301
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:22,460
but like, kill him, kill him, kill. You're killing the animals. I'm not killing the animals. Oh,

302
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:31,139
what did that, what's that for? I'm not killing any animals. No, that's a lie. I don't believe

303
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:37,610
the people in here saying that. That's a lie. They're lying to you. Be on the lookout for people

304
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:43,610
with false information right now on this channel. They're lying to you. Oh, I didn't know it was

305
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:49,829
going to be overwatered that far. That's that far. I thought it was a little more. Can you suck that

306
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:55,179
up? You can just like suck it up or something. All right. Wait, there's another one of these.

307
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:03,610
Give me this thing. I don't like this pavement here. Why would you pave a huge square around

308
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:09,750
one flower? Are you stupid? Terrible design, awful craftsmanship,

309
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:24,179
and a lot of new animals. Oh, I thought that was his tail for a second.

310
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:32,389
Congratulations. You have attracted a sense of flowers. Okay, a taply. No, I don't want, I,

311
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:38,760
these things, these things remind me of Otto, but I don't want to. Remember we had too many

312
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,920
taplys before and everybody freaked out and told me, put tap, put taply in fire.

313
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:52,739
Put taply in fire becomes fire taply. It was a lot of, I didn't want to do that anymore.

314
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:58,039
All right. I got to, I want to get rid of this shit. How do I like delete an area?

315
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:20,789
Shovel. Like I was getting rid of this. This is so dumb. Sell it? What do you mean sell it?

316
00:52:20,789 --> 00:53:09,380
How do I sell it? No, I want to take a picture. Go on. Yes. Okay. What was I doing?

317
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:17,769
Yeah. How do I sell this? Can I do that? I don't think I can sell this stuff guys,

318
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:23,380
unless I can't select it or anything. I just delete. Can I just go to the store?

319
00:53:24,019 --> 00:53:41,269
Go to the store. There is no store. There's the post office. I have to unlock the shop. Okay.

320
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:49,349
No, just don't, don't slap that, the mouth up and down really quick and make a laughing noise.

321
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:59,619
Oh, this doesn't, this tutorial doesn't matter. Okay. Somebody said, please do a chocolate

322
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:11,380
factory stream. What would I even, how would I even do? Would you like, you want to do like a

323
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:29,769
travel channel? This is the chocolate factory. Show me how it all works. Yes. So you guys

324
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:40,219
unanimously want a chocolate factory tour. There's no jokes here. It's just, hey,

325
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:50,150
this was the chocolate factory. This is what you want. There's not going to be like any,

326
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:53,030
there's no clowns going to run by her and it's, it's going to be like, that's what it is.

327
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:02,179
Okay. Not a joke. Okay. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do. I'll see what I can do.

328
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:20,570
He, he, what he, he acts like he doesn't want a factory tour. I mean I do. That's kind of cool.

329
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:34,679
I do want that. Okay. I'm going to try it. All right. All right. Let's see what I can do.

330
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:49,030
He's going to tour a chocolate factory. Yeah. I don't think this is going to work.

331
00:55:53,050 --> 00:56:00,010
It's going to be, it's going to be working loud. You don't really hear anything. It's going to be

332
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:06,969
like, so what do you think? Like just, you want to feel it. It's going to be like a vacuum cleaner

333
00:56:06,969 --> 00:56:17,500
in the background constantly. I'm going to have to get like a shitty lapel mic that's going to be

334
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:26,710
like, I think that, yeah, that looks like the chocolate coming off the rack there.

335
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:46,840
It's going to be the worst dream. All right. Fine. Cut his lapel mic. Fine. Okay. I still

336
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:57,449
need to make a hole here with the jelly bean factory. Am I going to start doing like

337
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:04,659
candy factory tours? How do I explain this to one of these factories by the way?

338
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,239
Make a phone call, make a few phone calls, talk to them. Just so I'm just wanting to get in touch

339
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,960
with you with your like your PR, your marketing or your, you know, your tour department for being,

340
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,559
you know, on like on camera and do it for like a broadcast. What am I supposed to say? Oh, cool.

341
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:29,099
What industry do you work in? Well, I'm like, I'm an e-clown. Oh, so why do you want to do this?

342
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:35,420
Is this like a new food channel? No, no, no. I just, one person in my community said that it

343
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,820
would be a fun idea to do a chocolate factory tour. So that's why I'm here. One person told

344
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,920
me to do this. Oh, so there's literally, you know, this, that you don't have any reason to be here

345
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,920
besides this one person told you to do this. Yeah. That's it. And that's, that's pretty much all

346
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:59,130
that's going to happen. I'm not like a food blogger. Should I make a food blog in the meantime,

347
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:07,159
just to like have a website and just like having for like the next couple of weeks,

348
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:14,329
write about like fucking foods I eat and then just send them there and say, hey, I'm an e-clown,

349
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:17,769
but I also do have a good a food blog. I just started and really try to, this is like,

350
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:37,820
this is like when, like I make it till you make it. Don't eat that. You don't know where it's been.

351
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:50,329
Okay. First of all, okay. Fine. I'll do like fucking, I'm going to do my own like fucking

352
00:58:50,409 --> 00:59:05,559
restaurant guide streams. Like chocolate factories and restaurants. This one's called

353
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:12,489
take a bite with Jerma. Take a more than, ah, more than you can chew. Starring Jerma985.

354
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:24,980
Got it. Got it. Printed. Done. Welcome back to more than you can chew with Jerma985. I'm here at

355
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:31,460
this joint. Well, that's, that's literally just ripping off completely. Um, guy fairy. I can't do

356
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:36,889
that. I can't do, I can't do that. I can't talk like that. All right. I need to play this game.

357
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:49,590
First of all, why? Why? Why? You, you put an idea in my head and now it's like the only thing I care

358
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:57,960
about. All right. I'll make, I'm going to make this happen. No jokes. I had so many other things

359
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:09,110
like planned. This is stepping over all of them. All right. You guys need a house. You even need

360
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:16,460
a daisy. What the fuck? Don't eat a daisy. You eat a daisy, please. They're over here. Eat it.

361
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:28,699
Eat daisy. Go do it tonight. I, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't take a tour of a chocolate factory right

362
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:40,809
now. You guys, it's not, it's not possible. All right. You need to eat two of these. One more.

363
01:00:40,809 --> 01:00:48,699
Has eaten one daisy. What? You just ate it. That's not a daisy. Wait a minute. Did you just not eat

364
01:00:48,699 --> 01:01:15,480
a daisy? It was a daisy. He just crushed it. What are you doing? Remember you should get bangs before

365
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:28,010
showing us the chart. Why would I get bangs? Why do you want me to have bangs? Are you going to eat

366
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:37,900
this or what? There you go. All right. You got to eat one more of those. There we go. All right. Now

367
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:51,380
we can do it. Now we need a bespotty house in the garden. How do we do that? Uh, nay. Thank you. Nay

368
01:01:51,380 --> 01:02:04,739
means nay for the 11 community subs. Thanks to the fucking 11 sub drop. Well, I don't want,

369
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:11,929
why do you want me to keep doing this? There's something deeply wrong with your audience.

370
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:30,789
Okay. I'm sorry. All right, guys. Stop being so weird. You're scaring people off. Stop being so

371
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:46,219
weird. No, no. Yes. Uh, I am the ruler of the kingdom and the rule of the kingdom says to relax.

372
01:02:46,219 --> 01:03:02,699
I have a new visitor? Never. No. Fuck the king. Uh oh. What have I done? We are influenced by you,

373
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:10,619
weirdo. No, don't. Don't do that. Captain Crunchy, thanks for the five community subs.

374
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:22,619
Jerma sucks. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks both of you. Cool. Hey, cool. Thanks.

375
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:31,559
Finally, we can build a house. We need a, uh, build a house for the beskotties. A beskottie house.

376
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:37,639
There it is. How much does it cost? Zero. Good.

377
01:03:41,559 --> 01:04:01,139
Now what if? No. God damn it. Don't fucking do this. No, it's, I can't right now.

378
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:09,860
I can't do that right now. It's not possible. I can't do it. It's not possible. I can't.

379
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:21,289
I actually can't. I was gonna say instead of going to a real chocolate factory, just do a huge

380
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:28,250
fucking bit where they make a fake chocolate factory and go through a tour with like six

381
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:38,250
different people and they're all characters and like I'm in a costume and shit. It's just,

382
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:48,710
it's just Willy Wonka, but it's not. Oh, there's a lot of, that's a lot of money and I can't,

383
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:53,429
right? This is like all the, that's not possible right now. Maybe, maybe in the future.

384
01:04:53,429 --> 01:05:04,280
All right, I gotta put this down. You're a, I'm not a millionaire. I don't know if you'll get

385
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:18,010
this idea. I don't have, I don't have millions of dollars. This is, this is like, this is like

386
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:36,570
expensive. Making a fake chocolate factory is, that's extreme. You own two houses. Oh,

387
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:50,150
I don't own two houses. What are you talking about? He owns three. That was very, I'm kidding.

388
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,280
No, but for real, that's, I'll have to figure out how I want to do that. That'd be really fun.

389
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:07,219
He owns a Boston vacation house. I don't own that. Stop.

390
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:19,769
Tore, tore a sewage plant and pretend it's a chocolate factory. Holy shit.

391
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,820
And the whole time, the whole time I'm asking questions about like, so what do you wrap it

392
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:38,139
and everything? And they're just, they keep correcting me. This is not a chocolate factory.

393
01:06:38,139 --> 01:06:43,130
What's wrong with you? So I see up there, is that, is that where the, is that where the vanilla

394
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:51,429
paste is added? This is, this is shit up there. What's wrong with you? The whole time, I'm just

395
01:06:51,429 --> 01:07:05,579
so fucked up and so oblivious. I think that's where I am. This is very, oh, they have like a

396
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:25,110
nice little driveway. Just ask for money from your 985 relatives. I can't, okay. This is

397
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:35,909
fucked up and wicked fucking disgusting, but I can't even say it. Okay. So, oh, come on.

398
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:45,530
Do you know where it could go? I'm not going to, I can't, I can't even talk about this. We're

399
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:58,920
going to move on. I can't talk about that. It's too fucked up. It's too fucked up. It's too fucked up.

400
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:03,880
I can't, I can't, there's too many people here. There's 5,000 fucking people. I can't be on,

401
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,039
I can't record myself saying this in front of 5,000 people. My mother would be so ashamed of me.

402
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:26,170
All right, let's open it. Ta-da. Make bugleberry say it. It's not even you. Oh, that's not,

403
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:36,460
that's not how this works. I, I can't, I can't like plead insanity to my mother. Oh, it's okay.

404
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:47,100
No, it's okay. My mother's going to be very upset with me. I can't, I can't do that to my mother.

405
01:08:47,659 --> 01:09:01,180
Here, I'll say it. Just type it to me. I'll say it. No, no, no. Okay. I was just, I was going to say,

406
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:06,220
let's, let's just, okay, let's make these two bugs. Let's just, let's just let these two bugs

407
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:15,000
have sex with each other and maybe we'll, oh, don't hit them. Come here. You guys ready? Oh,

408
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:25,750
no, no, no, wrong. It's these two. And here we go. We're going to have some bespotty children.

409
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:41,350
I always go, okay. Welcome to the romancing mini game. Like this, no. You need to take

410
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:45,829
control of your pinata and try to reach your partner without hitting any loavers.

411
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:49,750
The loavers are creatures created by Professor Pester and they hate the pinata being happy.

412
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:58,149
It's so fucking messed up. I can't say it. But it's kind of funny. If you hit a loafer,

413
01:09:58,149 --> 01:10:02,149
you will lose a chance and waste some of your time. If you lose all of your time.

414
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:09,369
All right. So like the sewer water is coming down, right? Just like through like a pipe.

415
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:18,409
It's like, and I'm like, oh wow, cool, man. It's like a fountain. Like can I try it? I just like

416
01:10:18,409 --> 01:10:33,579
dip my head underneath it and like, and it's like, you know, when like a huge amount of water

417
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:41,460
in a very concentrated beam, like it hits a part of your body and it just like it fucking goes

418
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:56,090
everywhere. Imagine that like directly in the forehead. There you go. That's what I was thinking.

419
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,850
I didn't say anything. I just that's what that's what I was thinking and it's like ridiculous.

420
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:06,060
Okay. I said, I said the sewer. I said the water. I said the sewer water coming down

421
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:16,699
and say anything else. Okay. This is game over. How did I get a game over? Your mom is my mom.

422
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:24,729
No, mom. I know you, mom. I know you're watching. Just remember I almost ate a shoe on camera.

423
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:30,489
Okay. Like just, I don't know. We talked about that and it was like, don't do that, honey, please.

424
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:37,180
I was like, mom, I'm not gonna eat a shoe on camera. I'm not going to unless, unless in a

425
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:40,939
few days, maybe they get like a hundred million, like 10 million channel points will come in and

426
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:48,840
maybe I'll do it. Oh, the romancing mini game. Right. Okay. Let's go. The old saying goes,

427
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:55,029
you can't hurry love. And that's especially true on Pinata Island these days. You'll notice that

428
01:11:55,029 --> 01:12:00,869
the object of your affections will be none too pleased if you make your approach before proving

429
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:05,430
your feelings. To do this, you need to collect the required number of love hearts.

430
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:10,090
You'll do anything for money. Oh, stop. I won't do anything for money.

431
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:17,850
But I do like that word. I do like that word money. Any heart tokens you leave behind. No,

432
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:25,609
I won't. Okay. To do this, you need to collect the number of hearts and you get a bit of meter.

433
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:38,949
Okay. Let's go. Okay. All right. You've walked in the way. This is tricky. This actually is

434
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:46,470
tricky. This actually, this actually, this actually is actually, this actually is actually

435
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:57,960
tricky. Oh, fuck it. This time of it. Holy fuck. I was lost. Actually, it's actually, it was actually.

436
01:12:59,369 --> 01:13:09,449
Yep. Now you've completed the game. Your happy pinatas will go into their house

437
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:15,130
and do a romance dance. And this is, they do the dance, right? Do we get to,

438
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:19,430
I really don't want to say this part out loud, but do we, the last time in the last game,

439
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:25,770
do we get to, do we get to, um, in the last game, you can, they did a dance on camera.

440
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:34,699
Do we get to watch? I don't, okay. First thing I thought that was a dead snake. I was like,

441
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:47,670
holy shit. You want, no, they do like a dance and can't you see? Yeah. It does it automatically.

442
01:13:47,670 --> 01:14:31,750
Great. The storkos. Your pinatas have made an egg. Your pinatas have done the romance dance.

443
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,710
A new baby pinata is brought to the garden safely packed in a patterned egg.

444
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:44,550
Oh, so now we're gonna wait for that to hash. Level four already. What is level four? You really

445
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:56,140
seem to have taken a shine to this garden. New store items. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh, you,

446
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:01,539
I don't, uh, don't eat that. You know what? You can't eat that. Don't eat that. Your new

447
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:07,220
egg has been delivered safely. Don't eat that. Just, excuse me. You, you are encroaching on

448
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:19,739
my property. That's the only wormhole that I have. Just murdered him. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

449
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:28,619
All right. Now go back in and do it again. Go eat a daisy and do it again. Cause I need more

450
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:39,770
bespotties. Oh, he moved in. He ate one of my friends and decided to move in. Well, that's

451
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:51,590
great. Why is my frog in prison? Is he not? What do you mean prison? I mean, yeah, he kind of is.

452
01:15:51,590 --> 01:16:09,289
How do I free the frog? I didn't even know. Uh-oh. Apple, right? Sour shelly bean.

453
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:22,859
Seed feast. All right. Uh, this is, I feed, this is the same way in the last game. I feed it a, uh,

454
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:31,159
an apple seed and they become my friend, right? Do the Gary. Do Gary. No, I'm not gonna do Gary.

455
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:36,600
Do Gary. Do Gary. Oh man. I can't. No, I'm not gonna do Gary. All right. All right.

456
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:44,149
Ah, all right. You know, people are begging me. Have to. Every time a new pinata is hatched in

457
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:50,310
your garden, your label is fixed to it. You can change your label by using the label designer.

458
01:16:52,569 --> 01:17:07,020
Where does it ship these up? You want to get rid of? Pack. Are we going to fire them out of the can?

459
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:13,880
Wait, this is a baby. Hold on a second. Have I, did I just take their baby and I'm going to fire

460
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:33,100
the baby out of a cannon to a party? Congratulations on romancing your bespottis. You breezed through

461
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:45,369
that. Well, it looks like. That's crazy. That poor baby. Hey everyone. You should all know

462
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:51,369
my store is open again. I expect to see you in here very soon. Just bring lots of cash.

463
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:56,010
Nobody likes the taste of chocolate coins more than Lottie, I can tell you.

464
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:01,050
I love chocolate coins. I used to pretend they waste to play poker with them.

465
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:06,220
And then we would use them instead of money or chips. It was so much fun.

466
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:24,869
Okay, remove the fence. He's a child gambler. You guys didn't, when you were like a teenager,

467
01:18:24,869 --> 01:18:32,869
you didn't play like chocolate coin cards. You guys didn't play like Oreo poker.

468
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:50,779
Nobody in here played Oreo poker. You, what the fuck? That's like, you didn't play like

469
01:18:50,779 --> 01:19:00,039
war for like Oreos. The fuck is, what the fuck is going on? No, we play Fortnite.

470
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:23,140
We play, we play Fortnite for Oreos. All right, let's do, I need to get some seeds. I need to

471
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:32,140

472
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:37,270
alone. Leave him alone. He didn't do anything. You're like, you're just being annoying to the

473
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:53,850
frog. Okay. Let's go to the store. Don't play with your food. Well, then tell them to stop making

474
01:19:54,569 --> 01:19:58,729
chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs. Not my fault.

475
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:04,390
Or whether you're here to buy or sell, which will it be today? Highlight and select one

476
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:12,710
and let's get those coins flowing shopping. All right. Paving. But now I, I can select this

477
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:21,239
and I can sell all the shit that's over here. Right. You're buying, huh? Is there, how do I

478
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:30,710
just sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. Okay. This is the dino nuggets are good.

479
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:43,020
I know you don't think I know. No, no, no. Don't sell the toad.

480
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:51,829
Wait, how is it a toad? What is it? That's a toad. Oh no, your name is toad. Right. Okay.

481
01:20:51,829 --> 01:21:13,420
They're okay. I guess you can make my garden as I see fit. Yes. If not for spending, I'd spend,

482
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:24,090
surely can do. This game is so chill. Yeah, it is. Do I like fish sticks? Um, yes, I do. I do happen

483
01:21:24,329 --> 01:21:37,430

486
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:52,789
know. No one even asked him. I know. What do you got? What are you selling? What are you buying?

487
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:22,470
Stranger. What should I get? Fruits? Oh, paving. No, let's do, uh, no, I don't want anything. I

488
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:35,670
just want a regular round. Is there anything? Wait, let me check. Should I free the, uh, no.

489

490
01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:52,319
That's a hundred fucking dollars. There's no message. Just a hundred bucks in bits. Thank you. Seriously. That's a lot of fucking money and

491
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,600
It's just a bunch of money that you just gave me in bits right now

492
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,680
That's that's pretty much all there is to it. I can't fucking believe that you did that and there's no message. It's just

493
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:07,260
I'm fucking forever grateful. Thank you. Thanks a lot

494
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,140
Chocolate funds play Resident Evil 4

495
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:16,319
It's a huge money

496
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,819
Yeah, I actually here's the thing. I want to play Resident Evil 4 for the Wii

497
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:26,409
Because that's the best version and uh, but I know a lot of people gonna say PC play piece

498
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:31,810
No, the Resident Evil 4 for the Wii version is the best version. I'm not playing it PC

499
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:41,970
Resident Evil 4 for the Wii by streaming tomorrow. Yes, but we're gonna we're gonna continue to do these reduced

500
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:45,130
Stream hours for a little while until

501
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:49,329
Just to be up to be frank with you to be upfront with you

502
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,010
a

503
01:24:51,010 --> 01:24:55,890
Lot of services and a lot of stuff has slowed down a lot since all the corona virus stuff

504
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:59,829
But that's why it's taking a little bit more time. It's kind of get it all done

505
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:02,779
so that's why

506
01:25:02,779 --> 01:25:04,779
Didn't really get everything done that we wanted to

507
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:12,550
But that's just you know, that's the way it is right now, you know have to do we can right?

508
01:25:13,069 --> 01:25:16,970
So over the next week or so

509
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:23,880
We'll be doing these reduced streams for us to kind of get everything we need to get done get done

510
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:29,859
He's never gonna play Hulk. Well, that's funny you say that because Hulk is actually

511
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:33,880
Scheduled for two or three months from now. So you're right

512
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:43,699
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I just wanted people to go wall park. Here we go

513
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:47,170

01:25:57,470 --> 01:26:09,260
I need more flowers. Let's water this stuff. What do I just seriously ship them off?

516
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:16,470
He's never going to do a sir is wrath DLC. Ah

01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:24,390
I know I want to but I got I know we're gonna do DLC day

518
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:30,039
Okay, I'm gonna set up a thing where we do the DLC for every fucking game

519
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:36,890
I said I was gonna do DLC for at the same day whoo cocoon hatched where

520
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,560
Has emerged from a cocoon

521
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:56,449
From a light about no, I'm not no, no, no, it's just not not jump King you serious

522
01:26:56,449 --> 01:27:02,220
I'm not playing not no. No, where do you get the idea? I'm gonna do jump King

523
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:08,960
I'm not doing the jump King DLC you out of your mind. All right, let's eat. Let's do some more

524
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,739
Let's get some of his bodies. Come here. Eat a daisy. Can you eat this daisy? You need this one?

525
01:27:15,909 --> 01:27:24,659
No, I'm not. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not doing jumping DLC. No way

526
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:31,859
It's not gonna happen. Like I'm telling you just for being completely honest here. I'm not going to do that

527
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:37,659
Um, I got to like this the second the DLC ice level place up a little higher

528
01:27:38,949 --> 01:27:50,619
I'm not prepared for that. Oh, what about Odama? No, I'm not. No, well, why do people hold on?

529
01:27:50,619 --> 01:27:55,359
I've got a very important question. Why does everybody think I'm gonna play Odama again?

530
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:01,829
Do you not remember when that stream ended and I said and I quote without any paraphrasing

531
01:28:01,869 --> 01:28:07,590
I will never play this game ever again. I cannot wait to never see this game on my screen ever again

532
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:12,270
And what it's all of a sudden now, it's like I can't wait to leave place on Java again

533
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:16,510
I can't touch that once you're gonna play a Java again

534
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:27,319
No, no, no never I need a seed. I actually liked Odama

This is a pillar stream. No, it's not. This is a chill animal stream

616
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:32,920
No, that's not correct. It's not to who

All the time

621
01:40:47,979 --> 01:40:49,380

625
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:16,880
It's just chocolate flavored water. It tastes like metal though. You just said that I didn't

626
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,579
It doesn't taste like a metal

627
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:29,829
Alright, everybody everybody relax. We found one. Okay, a Gekki finds it hard resist a delicate snow drop flower

We say words like this leaning in to make them like more funny for no reason

665
01:47:20,779 --> 01:47:22,979
But they're not and that's just like a comedy thing to do

All right, let's go post office if you have a crate related problem

667
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:38,979
It's a comedy thing

668

What's wrong with this guy?

669
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:43,279
Not really that much. I'll be honest

670
01:47:46,899 --> 01:47:52,239
I'm fucking normal

671
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,000

Bugleberry cooking

701
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:46,979
If you know there's a bugleberry cooking stream, you know, there'll be at least a few. Oh, oh at least like one or two

702
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:57,140

703
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:02,689
So I need a here we go I need a uh, a lot of scotch population

704
01:51:03,649 --> 01:51:05,970
So then the geckos can live here

705
01:51:08,739 --> 01:51:18,600
If it's bugle it's not gonna be bugleberry, okay, let's get those daisies up so we can get some more flutter scotches

706
01:51:24,039 --> 01:51:26,560

01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:12,199
What are you what's your color scheme?

726
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:20,899
Pink and white. Okay. Okay now

727
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:24,020
We need these daisies to grow

728
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:35,680
How do I make his candy bar status go all the way up? He needs to eat flutters. We need more flutterscotch

729
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:43,560
All right, you two ready

730
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:49,220
All right need that they both need to eat a turnip. Do they? Yes, they do. I need more turnips

731
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:53,520
Let's make another. Okay, we're gonna put turnip this daisies. We're gonna do turnips this way

732
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:58,680
I'm getting so fucking pumped up

733
01:53:59,159 --> 01:54:05,640
Not actually though you lost 100 people since the bugleberry impression whatever

734
01:54:15,829 --> 01:54:23,970
Okay, get that away seed bag he doesn't give shit

735
01:54:27,159 --> 01:54:42,960
All right

736
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,640
water

737
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,439
Can I

738
01:54:45,439 --> 01:54:52,420
Can I upgrade the can or no? Is there even a reason to upgrade the watering can yet?

739
01:54:52,739 --> 01:54:58,500
Probably not how quickly could I lose every single viewer? It wouldn't take very much time

740
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:04,680
I would just play white noise as loud as I can possibly go and turn it up all the way to like plus 5000 db

741
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
You would just everybody would leave you have to

742
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:13,399
Like the people wouldn't stay for that as much as people like pretend like they would

743
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:21,279
All right, here we go

744
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:28,600
You want to experiment no, i'm i'm i'm playing uh, i'm playing viva piñata. I want to like just kill

745
01:55:29,239 --> 01:55:34,600
I don't want to blast white noise for 25 straight minutes. Why i'm not doing that right now

746
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
Or I know I mean, I know a way that it would

747
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:51,039
I could I would probably lose two or three thousand concurrent people that are here right now

748
01:55:51,859 --> 01:55:54,229
if I like switch to like

749
01:55:54,229 --> 01:55:56,069
like singing stream

750
01:55:56,069 --> 01:55:58,069
and like I was actually trying like

751
01:55:58,310 --> 01:56:03,350
Really really hard and it wasn't my I was really off key and shit and I was looking right in the camera

752
01:56:04,069 --> 01:56:06,760
If I was looking directly in the camera and singing

753
01:56:07,079 --> 01:56:09,640
I think at least three or four probably three thousand people would leave instantly

754
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,329
so

755
01:56:13,329 --> 01:56:17,090
And then i'm not like jokey like that. I got a feeling not not like that

756
01:56:17,170 --> 01:56:20,210
I'm talking like i'm looking in the camera and singing like add everybody here

757
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:25,350
I think it would take wouldn't take very long because i'm I can't i'm not like that great at singing

758
01:56:25,909 --> 01:56:30,069
And if I was like taking a dead serious, I feel like people would be like I gotta fucking get out of here, man

759
01:56:40,899 --> 01:56:43,140
Dude like

760
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:48,340
Really deep songs to not like rock and roll or like a beat or pop

761
01:56:48,979 --> 01:56:54,229
Like really like deep emotional song. I feel like people would be like, uh, i'm not really into this

762
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:04,479
You think you would say you would not

763
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:07,840
All right. We got turnips. We got daisies. I need to wear those. Uh,

764
01:57:11,329 --> 01:57:14,119

01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,680
A lot of daisies. Okay, where are those?

768
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,739

You eat a turnip immediately. I stayed for the whole city skyline stream. That was a fun stream

771
01:58:03,859 --> 01:58:12,439
It was a pretty cool town. I had and then I don't think you want to stay in guys. It would be like

772
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,760
You don't you don't understand

773
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:19,479
I would go all in on it and it'd be like

774
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:24,840
Like it would be like that for like 30 minutes

775
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,800
With like instrumental behind me

776
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:38,760
You'd hate that they can move in any direction and we'll try to chase you down and zap you with their pesky pest power

777
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:40,439

Remember when you pause the game. I have to go to the bathroom. Okay. Sure. I'll give you 10 seconds

Prowling at night and stalking at night

1212
02:47:29,059 --> 02:47:34,239

02:55:15,819 --> 02:55:17,739
That was so much fun

1270
02:55:17,739 --> 02:55:19,739
It really was just collecting hats

1275
02:56:23,139 --> 02:56:24,639

1276
02:56:24,639 --> 02:56:26,159

Oh shit. Okay, cool

1278
02:56:29,809 --> 02:56:32,239
Can I get a pumpkin seed out of this?

1279
02:56:41,790 --> 02:56:44,590
I've not been using right now. I haven't been using fertilizer because I want to oh

1280
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:55,229
Look come here

1281
02:56:55,389 --> 02:57:16,979
Finally my dream of having ducks and frogs and geckos is finally coming true. Yes plucky and

1282
02:57:18,020 --> 02:57:20,639
gaffey

1283

We're gonna have them all

1286
02:57:37,219 --> 02:57:41,329
Huey louie

1287
02:57:41,329 --> 02:57:45,329
gaffey

1288
02:57:45,329 --> 02:57:47,329
Get the crab. Um, I will

1289
02:57:47,889 --> 02:57:51,469
All right, they need to eat a crab

1290
02:57:51,629 --> 02:57:56,190
So we need crab food and crabs need a bunch of water and more sand. Let's put sand over here

1291
02:57:57,149 --> 02:58:00,270
This is such a chill ass game, you know what I mean

1292
02:58:01,569 --> 02:58:04,049
This is fun. Just to just do who cares, you know what I mean?

1293
02:58:04,049 --> 02:58:08,370
It's just fucking it's like animal crossing but I can't play animal crosser right now because this is not here

1294
02:58:09,329 --> 02:58:12,930
Kim has it and can explain animal crossing. She's probably a ton of fun, but i'm playing

1295
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:15,829
I've got my own version of animal crossing right now. You know what i'm saying?

1296
02:58:26,930 --> 02:58:31,649
I don't want to be too sandy because the ducks probably don't like that

1297
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:38,069
I would assume the ducks don't like sand do they?

1298
02:58:52,860 --> 02:58:54,940
That's fine, I'll just replant it somewhere else

1299
02:58:58,719 --> 02:59:00,719
Makes like sands, right?

1300
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:05,280
Okay, that's all right

1301
02:59:07,329 --> 02:59:20,610
I'll just pull this just sell it. Whatever. I see you. Wait, what is this?

1302
02:59:24,510 --> 02:59:36,180
Tower of sour base. Can we see one? Can we see a sour tower guys? Don't you dare touch this pumpkin?

1303
02:59:45,870 --> 02:59:47,549
There it is. Nice

1304
02:59:47,549 --> 02:59:50,899
Let's get sour tower. I like it. I'm into it

1305
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:55,340
I want someone to eat this pumpkin

1306
02:59:55,819 --> 02:59:59,280
Oh another snake

1307
02:59:59,280 --> 03:00:01,200
You need to eat a mouse, right?

1308
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:06,750
Come on down. There's another one here. There's a mouse right here

1309
03:00:08,979 --> 03:00:11,780
You do have complete this access to eating a mouse

1310
03:00:12,819 --> 03:00:20,049
Eat it. It's a snake. It's not a snake. It's a surya bent

1311
03:00:21,969 --> 03:00:24,959
Okay, sorry. Oh look another mouse

1312
03:00:26,399 --> 03:00:30,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, don't eat this yet. You get over here run away

1313
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:33,280
I need a mouse house to generate mice

1314
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:38,000
Because that um, what do you need to turn up?

1315
03:00:38,959 --> 03:00:40,959
I gotta turn up right here

1316
03:00:43,729 --> 03:00:46,129
Eat that turnip and become resident because I want to breed them

1317
03:00:46,770 --> 03:00:48,190
Don't eat them

1318
03:00:48,190 --> 03:00:50,370
mouse house

1319
03:00:50,610 --> 03:01:00,340
House of mouse

1320
03:01:12,270 --> 03:01:14,270
Just get it out there

1321
03:01:14,270 --> 03:01:16,270
Because then i'll have two

1322
03:01:16,270 --> 03:01:19,389
These they can romance they can have they can breed and then we can have a bunch of snakes

1323
03:01:20,190 --> 03:01:27,280
Come on in here. Come on. This is a turnip right here

1324
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:31,280
I know you want it. Don't eat it

1325
03:01:31,520 --> 03:01:42,799
Come on. I know you want to please come on

1326
03:01:43,360 --> 03:01:45,870

Just have the hunter bring you the mice. Yeah

1329
03:01:52,190 --> 03:01:54,190

1330
03:01:55,549 --> 03:02:05,840
Where's the seed dude I've heard

1331
03:02:06,959 --> 03:02:14,299

1538
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:07,600

1546
03:26:02,819 --> 03:26:07,760
Wait, and where's the other one? You're over here somewhere

1547
03:26:08,690 --> 03:26:10,899

1549
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:21,469
Yeah

1550
03:26:21,469 --> 03:26:23,549
Okay, now mate

1551
03:26:23,549 --> 03:26:25,170
Actually, not yet

1552
03:26:25,170 --> 03:26:26,850
I want at least like

1553
03:26:26,850 --> 03:26:28,850
five or six mice

1554
03:26:31,569 --> 03:26:39,010
What does it take to mate you two need oh shit he's eaten one roe bean

1555
03:26:41,790 --> 03:26:43,309
So

1556
03:26:43,309 --> 03:26:45,309
Why am I making all these mice

1557
03:26:49,409 --> 03:26:53,840
I'm making mice for no reason then for the cats, I guess

1558
03:26:56,479 --> 03:26:58,479
Well, then I don't want to have that many

1559
03:26:58,799 --> 03:27:01,620
All right. You guys ready to romance

1560
03:27:03,260 --> 03:27:05,260
You're afraid of frogs, too

1561
03:27:09,780 --> 03:27:11,780
You got you afraid of everything

1562
03:27:13,629 --> 03:27:15,790
You're afraid of frogs. You're afraid of snakes

1563
03:27:21,120 --> 03:27:23,440
I'm about to fucking launch these guys into a cannon. What do you think?

1564
03:27:24,079 --> 03:27:30,750
You're still not ready yet

1565
03:27:30,750 --> 03:27:34,700
All right, I can do more water and more sand because I just got this upgrade

1566
03:27:35,420 --> 03:27:37,420
Let's do some water over here

1567
03:27:42,979 --> 03:27:45,700
And you're scared of mice

1568
03:27:45,700 --> 03:27:51,540
The synergy here is not really that great. I've done kind of completely wrong, but it's okay

1569
03:27:52,180 --> 03:28:07,540
nice

1570
03:28:07,780 --> 03:28:11,440
It's all water i think you might have a problem

1571
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:27,819
And you're out of being hunted stop that did you just lick him leave him alone

1572
03:28:37,389 --> 03:28:45,219
You're oh you're right here here. Are you stuck in here? You're stuck, aren't you?

1573
03:28:47,299 --> 03:28:49,860
Oh you dumbass

1574
03:28:52,100 --> 03:28:54,700
Go on get out

1575
03:29:02,750 --> 03:29:04,750
Mouse island. Well, we just need enough to have

1576
03:29:05,629 --> 03:29:08,510
So there's another snake very

1577
03:29:10,899 --> 03:29:13,299
Good thing they are mating because here comes another one

1578
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:22,479
Every time I make a new mouse they just get eaten and killed by a snake that then becomes a resident

1579
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:25,739
Whatever. All right, let's go

1580
03:29:34,079 --> 03:29:40,530
Bad no, I can't

1581
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:41,889
I can get this one

1582
03:29:41,889 --> 03:29:55,170
Don't even fucking risk it. I'm just too terrible

1583
03:29:55,809 --> 03:30:12,399
All right new resident. So that means I have three there's a lot of snakes. Where do I get these raw beans?

1584
03:30:20,799 --> 03:30:27,180
Uh-oh, it's our sherbet. Can I get a um

1585
03:30:29,250 --> 03:30:44,290

1586
03:30:44,370 --> 03:30:45,860
Okay

1587
03:30:45,860 --> 03:30:50,079
You still not a resident?

1588
03:30:50,159 --> 03:30:52,159
No, you're you're a resident, right?

1589
03:30:53,469 --> 03:30:56,670
All right, where'd you drop the seeds?

1590
03:30:59,979 --> 03:31:02,610
I don't know planet

1591
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:14,129

1592
03:31:14,930 --> 03:31:17,100

03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:37,780
Cannon send him into the cannon, right?

1595
03:31:37,940 --> 03:31:58,620
Send him into the cannon rare. Where is he? Where is this? Where is he? There he is into the cannon

1596
03:32:08,319 --> 03:32:16,370
Kenyatta sent to party get a lot of experience with doing that, huh?

1597
03:32:17,010 --> 03:32:35,309
Almost a 60 of a whole level this is left two mice, right? Yeah. No, wait, it's only two left

1598
03:32:35,870 --> 03:32:54,479
The selector is kind of finicky. It's like almost like it doesn't want to attach the things that you're near

1599
03:32:54,639 --> 03:32:56,639
I'm just like goes by them

1600
03:32:57,520 --> 03:32:59,120
It's finicky

1601
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:05,329
Go to the tinkerer with a pumpkin

1602
03:33:07,379 --> 03:33:13,520
Uh, I think the pumpkin that pumpkin gone. Oh, there it is. Go to the tinkerer with a pumpkin

03:33:14,159 --> 03:33:24,239
Should I just throw it over there? How do I take how what do I do? Are you good to go?

1604
03:33:24,879 --> 03:33:33,059
Well, get up and eat that yam

1605
03:33:34,180 --> 03:33:39,620
Hmm, this is ladybug

1606
03:33:40,420 --> 03:33:43,680
Oh, no, it's just a toad

1607
03:33:46,930 --> 03:33:50,399
The hell what what is going on? What's wrong with you?

1608
03:33:52,059 --> 03:33:56,719
Wait, what what's wrong with this thing? Oh

1609
03:33:57,360 --> 03:34:00,159
Okay

1613
03:34:32,340 --> 03:34:47,920
This is so inefficient. It's unbelievable. It's like the most inefficient thing ever

1614
03:34:48,079 --> 03:35:03,860
I'm not even gonna get a coin bonus good

1615
03:35:05,520 --> 03:35:07,120
Fine, just leave

1616
03:35:07,120 --> 03:35:12,180
Don't worry. I'll be back tomorrow

1617
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:18,479
And the next day don't worry. I do want to I do want to do a few things though

1618
03:35:19,360 --> 03:35:20,559
I need

1619
03:35:20,559 --> 03:35:25,329
All right. I got three snakes two ducks one frog. Let's take inventory

Mate

1625
03:36:37,950 --> 03:36:41,229
Okay, that's it. I'm not doing any more mating with the mice

1626
03:36:43,020 --> 03:36:45,020
Now I just want to make sure that there's enough water

1627
03:36:53,219 --> 03:36:56,100
You're not going anywhere. Okay, what's the efficient way to do this?

1628
03:36:57,729 --> 03:37:01,149
It's to go

1629
03:37:01,149 --> 03:37:02,590
left side

1630
03:37:02,590 --> 03:37:10,190
I don't know like this

1631
03:37:43,139 --> 03:37:59,540
Who said I wasn't gonna get it? Who said I want to know who said it? This is a fucking yam. Let's see

1632
03:38:01,280 --> 03:38:03,280
Sell this yam too. I don't fucking want it

1633
03:38:06,379 --> 03:38:08,290
All right

1634
03:38:08,290 --> 03:38:10,590
Now let's get a couple seeds

1635
03:38:12,180 --> 03:38:13,940
Let's do some more water

1636
03:38:13,940 --> 03:38:18,020
Up there in the corner like I wanted and then let's do some water on the left for the ducks

1637
03:38:18,899 --> 03:38:20,899
What is this this thing fucked up looking?

1638
03:38:30,139 --> 03:38:32,579

03:38:48,780 --> 03:38:53,819
Hey, this guy's using that water. That's not that's not you can't use that water. You gotta live here

1643
03:38:54,700 --> 03:39:09,790
That's right. Get in here and live here. All right, we can send that mouse into a cannon move

1644
03:39:22,290 --> 03:39:26,479
Okay, that's all right. And then i'm gonna do the front of the duck house

Oh, that looks a little better. That's much better

Feels bad, man. It's a penis

1659

1677
03:43:21,569 --> 03:43:25,409
When would the uh gift or highest tip bit leader work? Never probably never

1678
03:43:29,790 --> 03:43:31,950
I hope your data gets corrupted. Holy shit

1679
03:43:34,850 --> 03:43:37,659
God, what the hell?

1680
03:43:37,819 --> 03:43:39,659
What the hell man?

1681
03:43:39,659 --> 03:43:41,180
Why?

1682
03:43:41,180 --> 03:43:45,659
Because then he can play doom

1683
03:43:45,659 --> 03:43:47,920
Hmm. I mean that's

1684
03:43:47,920 --> 03:43:51,760
Well, no what we would actually be playing no more heroes or a beautiful joe wouldn't go right to doom

1685
03:43:52,319 --> 03:43:59,819
All right, let's do the bits and the subs and everything only about four hours. So

1686
03:44:01,229 --> 03:44:03,229
Should go through this pretty quickly

1687
03:44:04,510 --> 03:44:07,629
We had ten dollars from lm man. Thanks for the ten buck germa

1688
03:44:07,629 --> 03:44:10,750
If you were if you were a pinata interview pinata, what kind of pinata would you be?

1689
03:44:12,030 --> 03:44:14,399
Um, I would just be one of the seeds

1690
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:17,600
You just plant me in the ground and just make sure I have enough water

1691
03:44:18,239 --> 03:44:20,989
And just sit there and i'll be fine

1692
03:44:23,940 --> 03:44:26,430
Uh, thanks for a thousand bits though

1693
03:44:26,510 --> 03:44:32,190

1695
03:44:35,950 --> 03:44:41,229
It is going uh lm man again. Thanks for the 500 bits kiss mary kill

1696
03:44:42,270 --> 03:44:43,149

1697
03:44:43,149 --> 03:44:45,389
Drew crew moo crew or the wink dinks

1698
03:44:58,180 --> 03:44:59,780
Uh, all right

1699
03:44:59,780 --> 03:45:03,940
I don't I flee the country

1700
03:45:03,940 --> 03:45:10,899

1703
03:45:25,250 --> 03:45:27,250
Uh, I would marry the drew crew

1704
03:45:27,489 --> 03:45:32,770
Because the drew crew is just so so incredibly passionate. They are so dedicated

1705
03:45:33,409 --> 03:45:35,809
They're incredibly loyal. So that makes sense

1706
03:45:36,829 --> 03:45:41,870
and I would go the wink dinks would be uh eliminated because it um

1707
03:45:47,620 --> 03:45:51,780
I I wouldn't they would just be I would not hang out with them anymore. It's okay

1708
03:45:54,139 --> 03:45:55,340
That's based

Thanks for 250 jeremy's garden when you're here your family that stole that from me

1712
03:46:05,219 --> 03:46:09,319
And I immediately gave you credit for it five seconds later. So it's not stealing. It was an attribution

1713
03:46:10,979 --> 03:46:13,219
Uh fire rossi. Thanks for the 600 bits

1714
03:46:14,020 --> 03:46:19,059

1715
03:46:19,700 --> 03:46:21,219

03:46:21,219 --> 03:46:25,379

Um, no, you're not a furry if you like no, excuse me. I gotta correct this

1718
03:46:33,149 --> 03:46:35,149
You're not a furry if you like

1719
03:46:35,709 --> 03:46:41,600
Uh vivi pinata because this is you taking care of animals. This is not you

1720
03:46:42,219 --> 03:46:47,469
Pretending to be the animals on screen. I'm taking care of these animals

1721
03:46:47,950 --> 03:46:50,430
I'm not pretending to be the animal on the screen. You know what i'm saying?

1722
03:46:51,149 --> 03:46:56,850
I mean wrong

1723
03:46:56,850 --> 03:47:00,610
Like if I was in the chair and I made that frog and that frog was supposed to be me

1724
03:47:01,090 --> 03:47:04,049
Then okay, that's like okay. I'm I'm that's me. That's my fursona, right?

1725
03:47:04,610 --> 03:47:11,250

Hey trance goat. Thanks for the 500 bits. Hey germa. Have you ever played graffiti kingdom?

You might like how wacky it is. Good luck with the rest of your move. Thanks a lot

1735
03:48:21,620 --> 03:48:23,620
Graffiti kingdom i've never played

1736
03:48:32,510 --> 03:48:34,510

It's pretty good

1741
03:48:47,540 --> 03:48:53,760
Do you read these or did I just waste 1200 bubble shirts?

1742
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:57,780
Um, I well that answers your question

1743
03:49:02,379 --> 03:49:06,219
You draw your own character. Okay. Well, that's all I need to know put it on the list

1744
03:49:08,059 --> 03:49:09,899

03:49:18,059 --> 03:49:23,389
Make that stream happen and I it will happen. I just can't say that'll happen now because obviously of

1748
03:49:24,270 --> 03:49:27,069
All the coronavirus stuff. I'm not sure that would be possible

1749
03:49:27,870 --> 03:49:31,700
We'll see though

1750
03:49:31,700 --> 03:49:35,139
Thank you apple shift for the 250. Hey, oh, when will the next community content night be?

2020

1760
03:50:20,860 --> 03:50:25,680
There you go. Hey peaceful hailey. Thanks for the 250. Hey germa. Hope all is well. Hope the move goes well

1761
03:50:25,680 --> 03:50:27,680
I know the world is in shit right now

1762
03:50:28,159 --> 03:50:33,440
And it makes it hard to do anything. Hope all this passes soon. Also i'm happy you're playing at viva people happy

1763
03:50:34,159 --> 03:50:36,459
Me too. It's a really fun chill game

1764
03:50:38,180 --> 03:50:46,860
Yeah, we're taking we're taking it slow and we need to kind of

1765
03:50:47,819 --> 03:50:50,299
Get to where we need to be

1766
03:50:50,299 --> 03:50:52,479
And do it slow

1767
03:50:52,479 --> 03:50:54,079
at a good pace

1768
03:50:54,079 --> 03:50:56,319
but slow enough where we can actually get stuff done and

1769
03:50:56,879 --> 03:50:58,879
To work around some of the companies that

1770
03:50:59,360 --> 03:51:14,819
Um have some coronavirus uh restrictions. So we're taking it slow, but thanks for the 250

1771
03:51:15,739 --> 03:51:18,579
Uh, stay safe

1772
03:51:18,579 --> 03:51:20,979
kill kilk run or kill

1773
03:51:21,700 --> 03:51:22,979
kilk run

1774
03:51:22,979 --> 03:51:26,020
Thanks for the threat. I don't know. I couldn't read that. Thanks for 300 bits germa

1775
03:51:26,020 --> 03:51:31,379
What about rain world? You completely forgot about it. Please play more. It's a good and slugcat is cute. Please play more

1776
03:51:31,379 --> 03:51:33,379
It's a good game pepe hands

1777
03:51:33,379 --> 03:51:41,469
What do I do now?

1778
03:51:41,469 --> 03:51:43,229
We cross the threshold

1779
03:51:43,229 --> 03:51:47,809
Those of you that don't know some of you new viewers don't know what the threshold is and that's a huge quote

1780
03:51:48,690 --> 03:51:50,690
The threshold is I play a game

1781
03:51:51,090 --> 03:51:53,170
And I say yeah, I might go back to this

1782
03:51:53,170 --> 03:51:57,329
Uh, maybe like uh, maybe next week or something. Uh, and two weeks go by

1783
03:51:58,190 --> 03:52:00,850
After the 14th day

1784
03:52:00,850 --> 03:52:05,649
You've passed the threshold on if i'm gonna go back and play it. So

1785
03:52:06,450 --> 03:52:12,350
We've passed it

1786
03:52:12,350 --> 03:52:16,770
holo night pepe hands

1787
03:52:21,180 --> 03:52:22,940
DOS games, no

1788
03:52:22,940 --> 03:52:24,940
Fucking pepe hands

1789
03:52:26,620 --> 03:52:29,979
Sir's wrath dlc. Oh pepe hands

1790
03:52:30,700 --> 03:52:40,180
He promised to play half-life alex

1791
03:52:40,420 --> 03:52:41,780
Well

1792
03:52:41,780 --> 03:52:46,399
Put your pepe hands down for a second on that one. I want to play that I want to play vr

1793
03:52:46,479 --> 03:52:50,479
There's like so many good vr games that just can't physically do it right now. That's not a pepe hand scenario

1794
03:52:50,959 --> 03:52:56,909
That's a you wait and see scenario. We didn't pass the threshold on that one. I'm still there

1795
03:53:02,319 --> 03:53:05,120
Sit down and play alex

1796
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:07,520
I think the the device on my head

1797
03:53:09,010 --> 03:53:13,899
Because it's kind of heavy and annoying. I feel like that's gonna put pressure down on me. I

1798
03:53:16,510 --> 03:53:21,229
Very soon here i'm gonna have some actual real answers for what i'm doing with my life

1799
03:53:22,030 --> 03:53:24,030
in regards to my medical stuff

1800
03:53:24,030 --> 03:53:25,489
so

1801
03:53:25,489 --> 03:53:37,280
We'll cross that bridge soon reason for the short stream. Yes, the next few streams will be like this

1802
03:53:38,159 --> 03:53:39,440
because

1803
03:53:39,440 --> 03:53:41,200
Right after I turn this off

1804
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:43,200
I'm going back to the moving process

1805
03:53:45,629 --> 03:53:48,350
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't not stream

1806
03:53:49,969 --> 03:53:52,850
potentially like a full week or two straight

1807
03:53:53,569 --> 03:53:57,889
Because I do want to stream I want to hang out and play games and just chill and dick around I love doing it

1808
03:53:58,690 --> 03:54:02,129
So anytime I can put some time in and do what I want to so

1809
03:54:02,850 --> 03:54:11,620
He just wants to eat a burrito. Shh

1810
03:54:12,739 --> 03:54:14,319
Say that

1811
03:54:14,319 --> 03:54:21,329
He's gonna move from his stream computer to his bed

1812
03:54:25,780 --> 03:54:29,780
He's just gonna sit in the chair till four pacific. Oh my god

1813
03:54:31,489 --> 03:54:33,649
Anyways dark soul, thanks for the 250 tonight

1814
03:54:33,649 --> 03:54:40,370
I learned that trying to fake vr with resident evil 2 first person and vore px makes you instantly sick

1815
03:54:40,930 --> 03:54:42,530
Never try that shit

1816
03:54:42,530 --> 03:54:46,670
Also, when are you going to collaborate with someone from hollow live? You've already said ayaya

1817
03:54:46,750 --> 03:54:49,309
So you may as well. I have no idea what that is

1818
03:54:50,270 --> 03:54:59,219
If you said I will give you a million dollars if you tell me what hollow live is

1819
03:55:00,579 --> 03:55:05,149
Um, I would not get the million dollars. I would cry and go home and be like how the fuck

1820
03:55:05,149 --> 03:55:06,670
I don't know what that is

1821
03:55:06,670 --> 03:55:09,420
No, and I said the word. Yeah, whatever

1822
03:55:11,489 --> 03:55:13,969
He said it get him obstinare wall lover

1823
03:55:14,530 --> 03:55:21,700
Thanks to the 278 bits. Do you prefer 2k 14 wwe or 2k 15 to 2k 20 creative?

1824
03:55:22,579 --> 03:55:24,579
He's doing emote contest

1825
03:55:24,739 --> 03:55:28,500
Uh, everything after 2k 14 is absolute absolute dog shit

1826
03:55:30,639 --> 03:55:35,840
They just pulled the rug out from underneath the creative process that that game had after 2k 14

1827
03:55:36,319 --> 03:55:41,979
2k 15 all the way to now it's just been utter dog shit just dog shit

1828
03:55:42,700 --> 03:55:48,620
They cared more about having a realistic fucking sports simulation than having fun characters fight each other in a ring

1829
03:55:48,780 --> 03:55:53,500
That's what happened. That is just what happened when the companies changed over the the new company that took it over was like

1830
03:55:53,500 --> 03:55:54,940
Let's make this a sports game

1831
03:55:54,940 --> 03:56:00,350
And it was the biggest mistake that they ever made and from my understanding now the last one they made

1832
03:56:00,670 --> 03:56:05,389
Was an absolute total fucking joke of a video game. It was riddled with just awful bugs

1833
03:56:05,870 --> 03:56:08,270
No new features. It was a piece of dog shit from what i've heard

1834
03:56:08,750 --> 03:56:15,149
Um, so it did it did it turned into it turned into like the like a madden or like an mlb 2k fucking 20

1835
03:56:15,389 --> 03:56:21,920
But they just release a roster update and uh tweak the fucking fighting mechanic. He's so passionate about this

1836
03:56:22,159 --> 03:56:27,920
Yeah, I am because that's one of my favorite things on earth was making characters

1837
03:56:28,379 --> 03:56:33,180
In wrestling games and making them fight each other. I've been doing this shit since I was like fucking 13

1838
03:56:34,000 --> 03:56:36,159
Oh, I mean I could we could sit here with I could sit up

1839
03:56:36,239 --> 03:56:38,719
Grab a fucking cup of coffee right now and sit here for two hours

1840
03:56:38,959 --> 03:56:42,159
And talk to you about how much of a how much of a fucking injustice this is

1841
03:56:42,479 --> 03:56:50,260
I would sit here for like an hour straight. Anyways, uh, it was a big mistake

1842
03:56:51,309 --> 03:56:54,000
And I don't know who was responsible for that

1843
03:56:54,000 --> 03:56:56,479
There's a lot of people a lot of moving parts in that

1844
03:56:57,040 --> 03:56:57,840
where

1845
03:56:57,840 --> 03:57:01,680
Making it a more realistic sports kind of game rather than

1846
03:57:02,590 --> 03:57:07,549
Look, you're making a bunch of crazy monsters and you're doing fighting and CPUs are fighting each other in the ring

1847
03:57:08,180 --> 03:57:12,500
I don't know, but they've been stripping pieces of it for the last five years

1848
03:57:16,670 --> 03:57:21,549
I would do 2k 14. I would play it and I would continue to make characters and do rumbles on it

1849
03:57:21,790 --> 03:57:24,030
But it's so old at this point

1850
03:57:24,030 --> 03:57:26,270
It takes forever to do fucking anything in that engine

1851
03:57:27,469 --> 03:57:33,870
If you have more than five ten fifteen layers five layers on a character and you're painting on their face with something

1852
03:57:34,450 --> 03:57:40,860
You'll you'll press the button to do a circle and wait four straight seconds for the game to load the circle

1853
03:57:41,790 --> 03:57:45,389
It's just it's just old at this point on old hardware is not

1854
03:57:45,709 --> 03:57:55,709
It's just I can't I could never go back into that again. Wait for that new aew game. We'll see we'll see what happens

1855
03:57:56,659 --> 03:57:58,659
I know that um, was it yukes?

1856
03:57:59,170 --> 03:58:05,790
Didn't yukes broke off completely and was like fuck this we want to make our own video game from my from my understanding

1857
03:58:05,870 --> 03:58:09,969
That's in big quotes yukes was like this is boring the fuck out of us

1858
03:58:10,450 --> 03:58:12,819
Uh, we need to creatively

1859
03:58:12,879 --> 03:58:16,819
Re-imagine the series a little bit for ourselves and we want to make another game. That's a wrestling game

1860
03:58:17,219 --> 03:58:20,719
That's what i've heard

1861
03:58:20,719 --> 03:58:24,159
That's very encouraging because let's hope that they actually make something fun

1862
03:58:26,829 --> 03:58:33,280
I wish them the absolute best of luck and all the support and I hope they're passionate and I hope they make something good

1863
03:58:33,520 --> 03:58:41,540
That's all I can do but moving on uh, thank you

1864
03:58:42,239 --> 03:58:48,370
Nv11 casting for the 250 remember yesterday was my 21st birthday and it was pretty stressful

1865
03:58:48,690 --> 03:58:54,059
I can think of no better birthday gift than my favorite streamer. This is in all capitals singing

1866
03:58:54,139 --> 03:59:03,620
Happy birthday as poorly as possible jokes. Oh, it's a joke. It was a joke

1867
03:59:03,940 --> 03:59:07,870
They say jokes aside, uh, you don't have to sing if you don't want to look at that

1868
03:59:08,110 --> 03:59:14,379
But i'd appreciate any beverage suggestions you might have thanks for the laughs. I got one for you

1869
03:59:16,110 --> 03:59:32,750
Uh sprite a little bit of cranberry juice squeeze the lime happy

1870
03:59:34,030 --> 03:59:37,569

1871
03:59:37,569 --> 03:59:42,180
Happy birthday. Hey trans scout. Thanks for the 500 bits. I'm playing

1872
03:59:42,340 --> 03:59:46,739
I'm planning on getting two rats next semester and i'm in the process coming up with names. Do you have any suggestions?

1873
03:59:47,520 --> 03:59:52,399
Um, yeah black and blue, you know

1874
03:59:52,479 --> 04:00:07,520
Like is that because they fucking pray at night and they fucking stalk at night those are shit names like they're bruisers

1875
04:00:07,520 --> 04:00:22,620
Yeah to the two bruisers you have to try try harder. I like those names try what do you mean?

1876
04:00:22,620 --> 04:00:30,530
Try harder spaghetti and meatballs. That's way worse than what I said

1877
04:00:30,850 --> 04:00:40,959
If you name don't name any of your animals fart fart. That's such a bad. What a terrible name

1878
04:00:41,120 --> 04:00:49,149
Don't know. I can't believe people are laughing at that like give me a frank guys

1879
04:00:50,659 --> 04:00:59,309
Really my well my my cat's name is art

1880
04:01:04,030 --> 04:01:06,030
Okay

1881
04:01:06,110 --> 04:01:07,549
You wouldn't think that was real

1882
04:01:07,549 --> 04:01:12,430
But if it was that's actually kind of funny that it is real because it's such a that's such a rotten

1883
04:01:12,989 --> 04:01:15,899
awful terrible name

1884
04:01:15,899 --> 04:01:21,659
That if you just saw like fart the cat lying down on the windowsill or something just sitting there with his eyes closed

1885
04:01:22,540 --> 04:01:24,540
Like holy shit, that is the cat's name

1886
04:01:32,850 --> 04:01:42,540
That's such a bad name don't name your cat art thanks for the 500 bits

1887
04:01:43,260 --> 04:01:48,940
Uh scruffle. Thanks for the 400 bits cough cough. I don't know. I don't understand. This is why you coughing

1888
04:01:50,299 --> 04:01:53,819
Did I say are you like trying to tell me something like hey, uh, excuse me

1889
04:01:54,620 --> 04:01:58,209
What did I do? What did I say?

1890
04:01:58,209 --> 04:02:04,850
Tar alacran, thanks for the 250 bits. I doubted that you would stream this weekend. I was gravely in error

1891
04:02:05,250 --> 04:02:10,610
However, i'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed and chat must have their ban

1892
04:02:11,409 --> 04:02:16,209
I throw myself at the mercy of you and chat and ask that you commute my sentence

1893
04:02:16,530 --> 04:02:23,409
From a lifetime lifetime ban to only a ban for a week. I swear. I will be a reform chatter who never doubts the streamer

1894
04:02:24,209 --> 04:02:51,549
Yes, man. No mercy thumbs down thumbs

1895
04:02:52,590 --> 04:02:56,940
What do you mean? I actually did it?

1896
04:02:57,260 --> 04:03:00,590
What do you mean?

1897
04:03:00,590 --> 04:03:08,100
We have to have justice. It's like oh sire. I'm so sorry

1898
04:03:08,500 --> 04:03:12,819
Yes, I threw a javelin through your window and skimmed your forehead

1899
04:03:13,979 --> 04:03:18,379
And was trying to kill you. I was trying to murder you sire

1900
04:03:18,860 --> 04:03:20,860
But please just know

1901
04:03:21,100 --> 04:03:27,739
That fuck you and I die hate you but I am willing for you to drop me into the pit of the lions

1902
04:03:28,219 --> 04:03:31,579
But just know that I only expect to be in there for a day

1903
04:03:32,059 --> 04:03:35,260
And if I can make it a day then I want you to release me

1904
04:03:38,819 --> 04:03:40,819
So you don't make the terms

1905
04:03:41,469 --> 04:03:43,469
It seems your terms

1906
04:03:44,340 --> 04:03:52,159
Are unacceptable that was a convoluted example

1907
04:03:57,600 --> 04:04:03,360
It'll be back in i'll i'll unban them tomorrow. It's fine. I'll put my hand down to the fucking lion pit

1908
04:04:04,860 --> 04:04:08,700
And i'll be like, i'm just kidding. It was a joke. Let me see your

1909
04:04:10,620 --> 04:04:12,620
And then my hand gets fucking ripped off

1910
04:04:14,299 --> 04:04:16,620
Ah, it turns out hubris is the real killer

1911
04:04:17,100 --> 04:04:26,829
Anyways, what what what what happened? I just banned somebody for like, yeah. Oh, okay. I'll unban them tomorrow. I'll probably forget

1912
04:04:27,309 --> 04:04:31,489
I probably guys i've like told you that I was playing a certain game like tomorrow and I don't play it

1913
04:04:31,729 --> 04:04:35,649
So if i'm gonna forget about what i'm even streaming tomorrow, you think i'm gonna remember unbanning this guy?

1914
04:04:36,049 --> 04:04:43,700
I'm gonna forget i'm gonna forget forever

1915
04:04:44,420 --> 04:04:50,979
Okay, one of the mods unban tara alecran as of tomorrow at 7 32 pm specific standard time

1916
04:04:51,620 --> 04:04:56,399
I have a ban log. Okay

1917
04:04:56,399 --> 04:05:00,020
And I did ban the right person. There was no misspelling there. I didn't like add it

1918
04:05:00,020 --> 04:05:06,579
I had like an extra c or something. Hey goo berry juice

1919
04:05:06,579 --> 04:05:09,860
Thanks to the 250 I doubted that you would stream this weekend. I was gravely in error

1920
04:05:09,940 --> 04:05:14,579
However, i'm a man of my word and gave you permission to ban me if you streamed chat must have their ban

1921
04:05:14,899 --> 04:05:32,579
I throw wait, why is another person saying this just banned that guy too

1922
04:05:41,739 --> 04:05:44,459
You just you killed that you banned the wrong guy

1923
04:05:45,180 --> 04:05:50,799
All right, that was goo berry juice

1924
04:05:50,799 --> 04:05:56,719
Okay, by the way, just i'll give you another convoluted fucked up messed up like go around in five circles example

1925
04:05:57,520 --> 04:05:59,520
If there's a guy in front of you

1926
04:05:59,520 --> 04:06:01,520
And he's robbed a bank

1927
04:06:01,600 --> 04:06:03,840
Okay, and he's got a bag of money

1928
04:06:04,739 --> 04:06:06,420
And he's like I gotta get out of here

1929
04:06:06,420 --> 04:06:11,860
I just robbed the fucking bank and like money is flying out of his the bag and he's running down the street and he's like

1930
04:06:13,059 --> 04:06:15,059
Cops everywhere. You're just watching this happen

1931
04:06:15,700 --> 04:06:18,340
Don't um, don't run after that guy

1932
04:06:19,260 --> 04:06:25,549
And chant that you're also robbing the bank at the same time like me too. I'm robbing the bank too

1933
04:06:26,110 --> 04:06:28,909
Yeah, we both together. We're both robbing the bank together

1934
04:06:30,100 --> 04:06:32,979
I don't think you should do that. You're gonna get you're gonna get arrested

1935
04:06:35,950 --> 04:06:42,819
Uh, because that's just what happened and i've got him i've got justice has to be served

1936
04:06:49,180 --> 04:06:51,340
You don't want to you don't want to participate in that

1937
04:06:52,700 --> 04:06:55,360
I'm just saying hey grave embrace. Thanks for 250

1938
04:06:56,290 --> 04:07:00,610
I streamed doom for 14 and a half hours. I would say it's pretty good, but look out for the glitches

1939
04:07:01,010 --> 04:07:06,930
Some bosses have invincibility mechanics that depend on range, but doesn't properly gauge the range other than that

1940
04:07:07,010 --> 04:07:11,889
It's a whoa. That sounds terrible. Can't wait to not play that terrible fucking game

1941
04:07:12,530 --> 04:07:17,889
Wow, maybe there's a bug. It's a small like glitch or something. Get that off my list

1942
04:07:17,969 --> 04:07:23,549
I want nothing to do with it. I am I am appalled

1943
04:07:24,190 --> 04:07:27,709
And and offended that it would be released in a state like that

1944
04:07:28,190 --> 04:07:31,950
I want nothing to do with that shot. Why would I stream it? Yeah, thank you

1945
04:07:32,030 --> 04:07:36,559
Why would I stream that game god if i'm yelling thinking i've been playing on my own time

1946
04:07:36,879 --> 04:07:46,459
So i'm i'm not gonna stream it. No. Hey goiki. Thanks for the 500 bits

1947
04:07:47,500 --> 04:07:53,819

1948
04:07:55,760 --> 04:07:58,190
Thanks. Why is he so mad?

1949
04:07:58,510 --> 04:08:06,290
I'm not i'm not even fucking mad. Oh shit. I gotta quickly quickly quick quick quick quick

1950

Oh, hey there they are let's roll the credits here come the subs. Thanks for the subs you guys all of you appreciate it

And you'll see me in little bits and pieces here over the next few days

1953
04:08:25,819 --> 04:08:27,819
While I continue to get this all done

1954
04:08:27,979 --> 04:08:30,989
I really appreciate it. Thank you for your patience

1955
04:08:32,299 --> 04:08:33,579
because

1956
04:08:33,579 --> 04:08:35,579
I know that a lot of people right now are

1957
04:08:36,219 --> 04:08:42,459
Kind of just in their houses looking for something to do and i'm kind of the same way

1958
04:08:43,329 --> 04:08:51,629
So I would love to be here just I have to get this done

Thanks for the support all of you

1962
04:09:06,659 --> 04:09:10,180
There's a piñata in the corner

1963
04:09:12,459 --> 04:09:14,940
It might be

1964
04:09:14,940 --> 04:09:21,200
Thanks for the subs. We have some bits to do left. There's still a little bit left. We have rtx 4 20 69 ti

1965
04:09:22,850 --> 04:09:26,690
Eventually, they'll have to have that number although just skip it because they're too embarrassed to have it

1966
04:09:28,819 --> 04:09:30,180
Uh, thanks for the 250. Hey germs

1967
04:09:30,180 --> 04:09:39,979
I went shopping recently and I realized that germa raptor is incorrect and inaccurate. I don't understand

1968
04:09:40,540 --> 04:09:43,299
Germa raptor is incorrect and inaccurate

1969
04:09:43,860 --> 04:09:50,209
Because you went shopping

1970
04:09:50,209 --> 04:09:52,209
I don't get it. He's a fake

1971
04:09:55,379 --> 04:10:01,219
Oh, and they say there's another here's another 250. Oops. I did my bits early. Here's what I meant to say germa raptor is inaccurate

1972
04:10:04,159 --> 04:10:10,739
Oh, I see

1973
04:10:10,979 --> 04:10:13,139
Okay, so that's the yeah. Well, what?

1974
04:10:13,940 --> 04:10:15,940
That's right, they look the same

1975
04:10:16,100 --> 04:10:18,100
Of raptor faces of whatever

1976
04:10:21,819 --> 04:10:31,389
It's not it's a diet. Uh, really gonna you're gonna throw me under the bus here. Look

1977
04:10:32,190 --> 04:10:35,420
That's a raptor. It's not a raptor. That's et

1978
04:10:36,590 --> 04:10:43,540
look at

1979
04:10:43,540 --> 04:10:47,700
Jurassic world tyrannosaurus rex. Jurassic world velociraptor mass

1980
04:10:48,420 --> 04:10:55,840

Why are there so many people getting the velociraptor one? The t-rex one has 10 reviews and the velociraptor one is 500

1986
04:11:25,149 --> 04:11:27,520
But what's with people don't want the t-rex one. Why?

1987
04:11:28,239 --> 04:11:32,139
Because it's a sans raptor

1988
04:11:33,260 --> 04:11:39,579
Okay, you and like 16 other people know what that is the people buying these toys don't care that this is a sans raptor

1989
04:11:44,059 --> 04:11:47,579
Why does everything have to be said? It's like and I see it too. Why is everything I

1990
04:11:52,780 --> 04:11:58,139
Hey reaper 500 thanks, but the 250 hey germ boy minister convinced chat to stop to shop

1991
04:11:59,379 --> 04:12:05,459
To stop asking you to show something if you use your germ powers to stop this

1992
04:12:06,000 --> 04:12:09,889
Endemic, I wish I could I would I would love to have this all go away

1993
04:12:12,430 --> 04:12:16,750
Uh, I i'm not gonna say the thing you want to be saying because that makes that means people will

1994
04:12:17,629 --> 04:12:19,629
Say it over and over again and never stop saying it

1995
04:12:20,110 --> 04:12:23,870
The more you talk about things like this the more the people go i'm gonna say let me say that

1996
04:12:24,430 --> 04:12:30,510
So, uh, no not blt. We're we've got we're over that already and I just said it. I just fucked it all up

1997
04:12:30,989 --> 04:12:39,299
Um, I had to tell okay gnarly. Thanks for the 250. Good luck on the move david. Thanks a lot. That is my name

1998
04:12:39,860 --> 04:12:42,829
It's david

1999
04:12:42,829 --> 04:12:48,319
Thank you for the 250 ruined blood line. Thanks to the 250 germa

2000
04:12:48,319 --> 04:12:51,120
Why are you hiding the fact is you're a furry?

2001
04:12:51,920 --> 04:12:53,920
And a sleeper agent for the dru crew

2002
04:12:57,629 --> 04:13:00,030
Uh, because I i've invested in the dru crew

2003
04:13:01,090 --> 04:13:03,569
I bought the fucking dru crew super pack

2004
04:13:04,129 --> 04:13:10,260
Which has like 35 games in it. I have a very vested interest

2005
04:13:16,450 --> 04:13:18,610
Play more of it then I know I buy

2006
04:13:20,209 --> 04:13:21,809
That's that's

2007
04:13:21,809 --> 04:13:27,250
That's like last resort streams. You have to you have to understand that's like

2008
04:13:27,889 --> 04:13:31,489
Oh, no, there is nothing left for me to do. That sounds bad

2009
04:13:35,940 --> 04:13:38,180
Those are great games to have when it's like

2010
04:13:38,500 --> 04:13:41,940
Oh the thing that we're doing turns out sucked or really wasn't fun at all

2011
04:13:42,260 --> 04:13:45,379
I have nothing else to do and I don't have any plan and I have nothing set up

2012
04:13:46,180 --> 04:13:48,180
I okay. Will it open up nancy dru?

2013
04:13:52,520 --> 04:13:55,469
Apocalypse stream. Yeah

2014
04:13:55,469 --> 04:13:57,469
Those are excuses as a last resort

2015
04:14:00,450 --> 04:14:03,409
Yeah, uh dru crew is not my first choice

2016
04:14:04,129 --> 04:14:07,250
For what I want to do on a day-to-day basis. It was

2017
04:14:07,969 --> 04:14:09,629
It was

2018
04:14:09,629 --> 04:14:13,379
I mean it was

2019
04:14:13,459 --> 04:14:15,459
Was it was

2020
04:14:20,190 --> 04:14:23,389
Those you yeah, you said you would marry them

2021
04:14:27,920 --> 04:14:29,920
Rain world is second to dru crew

2022
04:14:30,879 --> 04:14:35,680
What do you want me to tell you? What do you what do you what do you want from me? Hey, okay?

2023
04:14:36,719 --> 04:14:38,719
Uh, no, thank you. Oh kage

2024
04:14:39,680 --> 04:14:41,280
Oh kagesha

2025
04:14:41,280 --> 04:14:42,500
Doh

2026
04:14:42,500 --> 04:14:47,219
Oh, it's hard for me to read this name because it's all in lowercase and I don't have there it is okay

2027
04:14:47,379 --> 04:14:49,379
Okay, okay shadow king

2028
04:14:50,670 --> 04:14:54,110
Thanks for the 300 bits. I'm fucking stupid. Hi gerber. Really love your streams

2029
04:14:54,110 --> 04:14:57,149
They've been a good way to find happiness in the current hell. We are all in

2030
04:14:57,709 --> 04:15:14,219
Would you ever play a disgaea game? Probably not probably no. Yeah, where the wink thinkers at sad face

2031
04:15:15,100 --> 04:15:18,719
I don't think there are any there's not very many anymore

2032
04:15:19,520 --> 04:15:26,979
I don't think there's very many wink thinkers. I think they never was very many wink thinkers to begin with

2033
04:15:28,639 --> 04:15:33,120
You had some bandwagon wink thinkers that kind of jumped off after links went away and

2034
04:15:43,090 --> 04:15:45,090
I can't even read that. You're fucking crazy

2035
04:15:45,409 --> 04:15:48,690
Hey morning maple. Thanks for the 250. Hey gerber before I forget

2036
04:15:49,170 --> 04:15:52,129
There's a game you can get on the pc and switch and think you enjoy called

2037
04:15:53,579 --> 04:15:55,260
pico nico

2038
04:15:55,260 --> 04:16:00,940
It's a short physics based puzzle exploration game. I think it'd be worth streaming because it could be beaten in just one stream or two

2039
04:16:01,579 --> 04:16:04,100
If you play your cards, right?

2040
04:16:04,100 --> 04:16:09,379
The humor can be a bit lol. So random and there's a cringy meme or two in there

2041
04:16:09,379 --> 04:16:24,290
But the gameplay is consistently fun is the trailer. Good luck with the boob lol. So random. Okay, i'll give this trailer 10 seconds

2042
04:16:28,000 --> 04:16:45,620
It looks all right. It looks all right sour, please

2043
04:16:46,420 --> 04:16:49,149
floygan 2

2044
04:16:49,149 --> 04:16:51,409
Show us

2045
04:16:51,409 --> 04:16:52,930
I don't want to show you guys

2046
04:16:52,930 --> 04:16:56,860
I don't want you to see I don't want to wait you you want to see what like a stream could be

2047
04:16:57,180 --> 04:17:01,340
I want you to be surprised

2048
04:17:03,739 --> 04:17:07,260
He's too lazy to put the browser source on and resize the window to youtube

2049
04:17:07,819 --> 04:17:15,180
He's a toxic streamer. I'm not a fucking toxic streamer. What the fuck are you talking about?

2050
04:17:21,229 --> 04:17:23,229
And finally we have uh 250

2051
04:17:24,700 --> 04:17:27,170
From jason. Thank you jason

2052
04:17:27,170 --> 04:17:29,649
Here's the person you're supposed to ban for life. I already did

2053
04:17:34,659 --> 04:17:39,860
This is uh, this is tar tar alec for they've been banned. They did they says but they said they said

2054
04:17:40,420 --> 04:17:42,350
Here's this and I quote

2055
04:17:42,350 --> 04:17:49,069
The odds that germa manages to move to a new house set up internet properly find the motivation to stream is less than zero percent

2056
04:17:49,629 --> 04:17:54,989
If germa streams a real stream next saturday, I give him permission to personally ban me for life

2057
04:18:00,129 --> 04:18:02,129
That's the right guy. Yeah, it is. It's the right guy

2058
04:18:05,389 --> 04:18:07,389
You didn't move though

2059
04:18:07,549 --> 04:18:10,430
I mean, I mean look i'm in the process of moving

2060
04:18:10,989 --> 04:18:14,350
That's why I had I took the last like four or five days off

2061
04:18:16,930 --> 04:18:18,450
It's a process

2062
04:18:18,450 --> 04:18:25,120
What do you mean it doesn't count you didn't move and didn't stream a full stream

2063
04:18:26,620 --> 04:18:27,840
um

2064
04:18:27,840 --> 04:18:31,840
Four hours. All right, four four and a half hours. That's a stream

2065
04:18:32,559 --> 04:18:36,239
If this was like two hours, okay, I'd understand if this is like

2066
04:18:36,860 --> 04:18:38,879
2016 two-hour stream germa sure

2067
04:18:39,899 --> 04:18:43,819
Four four and a half five that's four and a half. That's a stream. All right, that's a stream

2068
04:18:43,979 --> 04:18:52,940
He still didn't move I bet assumed you'd be in a new place and you're not

2069
04:18:55,739 --> 04:18:57,739
They're only banned for one day. It's okay. It'll

2070
04:18:58,299 --> 04:19:01,440
What constitutes yeah, what what constitutes a full stream

2071
04:19:03,600 --> 04:19:05,840
What when it when it what is it? What is a full stream?

2072
04:19:06,559 --> 04:19:08,000
It has to be

2073
04:19:08,000 --> 04:19:10,700
six hours

2074
04:19:10,700 --> 04:19:13,219
eight hours

2075
04:19:13,219 --> 04:19:21,250
At least six hours six to eight hours at least 24

2076
04:19:22,290 --> 04:19:24,290
Six minimum six minimum

2077
04:19:24,690 --> 04:19:26,620
minimum

2078
04:19:26,620 --> 04:19:32,459
Six to eight. Yeah, six to eight is all right. That's a full stream. Yeah. All right. We're doing small condensed ones

2079
04:19:33,659 --> 04:19:35,819
I typically do six to eight. All right

2080
04:19:36,139 --> 04:19:37,520
Okay

2081
04:19:37,520 --> 04:19:39,680
All right. Yeah, you got you. All right. I didn't sorry

2082
04:19:39,680 --> 04:19:44,159
I didn't know everybody every single person in chat here is tar alacran's fucking lawyer

2083
04:19:45,870 --> 04:19:59,860
The ban will be removed just doing my civic duty

2084
04:20:04,780 --> 04:20:10,540
Oh, you see my client said full stream and germa 985 a typical full stream from germa

2085
04:20:10,540 --> 04:20:14,860
985 is presumably anywhere between six and eight hours sometimes even longer than that your honor

2086
04:20:15,420 --> 04:20:20,940
And you tell me this man comes in on a saturday after not streaming for four or five straight days

2087
04:20:22,370 --> 04:20:25,250
And only turns the stream on for about four to five hours

2088
04:20:26,239 --> 04:20:32,319
And says specifically in the beginning of said stream that this is not a real stream that these are going to be shorter

2089
04:20:32,719 --> 04:20:38,100
Streams that are not going to be typical your honor. You should throw the book at him

2090
04:20:39,540 --> 04:20:42,219
not at my client at germa and

2091
04:20:43,309 --> 04:20:51,040
And it's not aim for his chest aim for his shoulder. All right, let me see if I get

2092
04:20:53,219 --> 04:20:56,799
Uh, all right missed completely

2093
04:20:57,280 --> 04:21:03,200
I mean, I mean I hit the wall like 40 feet away. I look I i've i've thrown a fucking ball in a long time

2094
04:21:03,979 --> 04:21:09,739
Mr. Albertson. Yeah, sorry. I was there was a noise 40 feet over here. I know

2095
04:21:09,819 --> 04:21:11,899
Yeah, well i'm trying to do something funny for somebody

2096
04:21:12,459 --> 04:21:16,940
Mr. Albertson, you are hereby named guilty for

2097
04:21:18,200 --> 04:21:20,200
banning

04:21:21,180 --> 04:21:25,950
Let me see tar alacran for life

2099
04:21:26,670 --> 04:21:33,260
Uh, that ban will be removed will be reversed under the order of the court. Have a good day. I've made my decision

04:21:34,139 --> 04:21:41,020
What what the fuck are you fucking what the fuck you're kidding me. Oh, oh the fuck man. No, no

2101

What the we all leave the courtroom. What was the other guy's name? They've both been on bed

2102
04:22:07,420 --> 04:22:09,020
This is corruption

2103
04:22:09,020 --> 04:22:10,860
Move no move

2104
04:22:10,860 --> 04:22:17,329
