1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,299
This one goes out to all you watching the video right now.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,699
We're playing The Sims 3, baby, here we go!

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,380
What will I do?

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,380
The choices, they're true.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,219
Maybe I'll build a house.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,140
Maybe I'll make some food.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,980
I don't know, but it's time to begin The Sims.

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,420
Maybe we'll have some-

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,300
Oh, shit!

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,989
Don't pick-

12
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:28,870
Oh, God.

13
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,259
This is why you don't move your hands around when you sing a song.

14
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:35,500
I knocked over the fucking lamp that was on his desk.

15
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,590
Okay, let's take a look here.

16
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,990
Uh, I do not want this biker jacket.

17
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,670
Oh, by the way, for those of you who are interested,

18
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,549
this is exactly what I look like in real life.

19
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:50,619
Uh, I don't want this like jazz club waiter shirt.

20
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,140
Get rid of this fucking thing.

21
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,590
What else we got here?

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,689
We got like the snow vest.

23
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,850
We got, um, that weird looking thing.

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,460
We got Christopher Robin from Winnie the Pooh.

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,340
No, fuck that.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,299
No, thank you.

27
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,250
What else we got here?

28
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,049
Business man?

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,569
I think I could put the business-

30
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,180
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,060
This is perfect!

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,700
The smoking jacket with the green.

33
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,180
I wear this shit every single day.

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,469
I don't even wear pants.

35
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,629
Okay, so you can't have just underwear.

36
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:23,989
That's bullshit.

37
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,390
But anyways, let's make my name here.

38
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,390
Grandpa and last name.

39
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,430
What is my last name?

40
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:34,340
Yonko?

41
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,620
Yombo?

42
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,980
I do something like that.

43
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,099
Hey, Jeremy!

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,980
What is that?

45
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,840
What's our last name?

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,420
What?

47
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:45,930
What's your last name?

48
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,329
Why do you want to know?

49
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,209
Well, just say it.

50
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,370
My last name's different.

51
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,409
You're on mom's side, so-

52
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,409
I don't even know what my fucking first name is.

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,260
Now let's do it.

54
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Let's move into an empty lot.

55
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,140
And I'm going to build my dream house.

56
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,659
It's going to be so much fun.

57
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,900
Loading up the screen.

58
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,620
There he is.

59
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,340
There I am.

60
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,840
Grandpa.

61
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,020
So let's do the build tool here.

62
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Got to make my absolute dream home.

63
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,139
That will rival the celebrities of the world.

64
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:18,939
So let's go here.

65
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,969
We need some walls.

66
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:24,439
And I think I'm going to go up this left here.

67
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,120
Start with this little hallway.

68
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Let's start here.

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,599
Go all the freaking way.

70
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,039
Go all the way up here.

71
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,759
Up to stiff.

72
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,500
There you have $2,300.

73
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,129
Holy shit.

74
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,330
Build this over this way.

75
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,650
Make sure it's all the way to the right.

76
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,150
Okay.

77
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:42,669
That looks good.

78
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,080
Bring it all the way down like this.

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,919
There's my little room here.

80
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,560
What else do I need?

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,060
Oh.

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
Coming down this way.

83
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,240
Yes.

84
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,039
Yes, I did it.

85
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,080
This is a dream house.

86
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,039
Okay, let's do it.

87
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,240
Build the furniture now.

88
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,680
Let's put in-

89
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
Obviously, I want to-

90
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,159
Where's the toilets?

91
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,000
I need toilets.

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,729
Here they are.

93
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,729
Make sure we have at least a few of these.

94
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,530
Because I don't like to walk.

95
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,930
Because my legs are really not that great.

96
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,280
So I want at least, let's just say like seven or eight toilets in the house.

97
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,360
So wherever I am, I can always just sit down and take a shit if I need to.

98
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,310
And that'll be Dandy and Randy.

99
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,509
Now we need a-

100
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:30,830
What else is in a house?

101
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,669
Bed is lined up the way I want it.

102
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:33,949
Got my fridge.

103
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,550
Now I just need a TV.

104
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,710
Okay, let's put the stand here so I can watch my murder mysteries.

105
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,469
Click on the TV.

106
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,840
This TV looks pretty good.

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,409
Make sure it's lined up with the bed.

108
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,610
And it is.

109
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,789
My fridge is all set.

110
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:50,990
And I think that's it.

111
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,120
That's good.

112
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,560
This house is fucking great.

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,199
I wish I could live in this house for real.

114
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,159
It's got everything I could ever need.

115
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,240
Get over there.

116
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,960
Go see your new house.

117
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,879
Why am I talking to a mailbox?

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm not that stupid.

119
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,520
And apparently I have a stick up my ass by the way I'm running.

120
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,879
Yes, I love the bed.

121
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,439
We are agreeing on that together.

122
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,480
As one.

123
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,959
So what am I going to do?

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
What TV show am I going to watch first?

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
Maybe Murder, She Wrote?

126
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,279
What?

127
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,970
Why am I?

128
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,839
What is this?

129
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,079
Why am I just fucking puke?

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,480
Oh, so I just made Sherma.

131
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
He's on the left.

132
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,519
Jeremy is my grandson.

133
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,079
He's...

134
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,160
I think that looks just like him, but...

135
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,000
He's apparently being a real asshole.

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,279
There's nothing I can do about this.

137
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,519
Besides, tell him this is my house.

138
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,279
You're under my rules.

139
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,000
And you need to learn to be respectful.

140
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,319
And now he's pissing his pants.

141
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,240
I don't know why that's happening.

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,930
There's a toilet literally one inch to his left.

143
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay.

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,459
You know, I made way too many of these lights.

145
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,339
I probably should turn some of these off or delete them or something.

146
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,470
How do you turn that off?

147
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,509
Yes, go do it.

148
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,339
I'm supposed to be cooking dinner right now on the stove.

149
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,519
Please turn the damn light off.

150
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,160
Where's Sherma?

151
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,279
Can he turn it off?

152
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,680
Oh good, I think he's going to do it right now.

153
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,000
Go turn that off and we'll get going here.

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,639
You don't have to be...

155
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,660
Oh, no.

156
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,620
Oh, there's a fire.

157
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,259
There's a fire.

158
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,860
Somebody put that fire out.

159
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,180
Don't just stand there looking at it, you fucking idiot.

160
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,060
Put your fire out.

161
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,779
Use the fire extinguisher or call the goddamn police.

162
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh, he's running now.

163
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,259
Yeah, go ahead and run, you coward.

164
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,379
Where is he going?

165
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,899
Where are you running to?

166
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,720
Where do you think you're going to go?

167
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a small fire.

168
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,680
Grandpa will take care of this one.

169
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,480
I got this one.

170
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,959
Don't worry.

171
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,839
Extinguish the flames.

172
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,879
Who is that?

173
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,000
Who is this guy that just came to the house?

174
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,480
Who are all these people coming to the houses?

175
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,759
What the fuck is going on?

176
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,240
Yeah, I'm so glad you guys all ran over here to just scream at my fire.

177
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
Like, thank you.

178
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,879
Will somebody call the police?

179
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,079
Is that going to be a thing?

180
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,360
Can somebody do that, please?

181
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,639
Oh my god.

182
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
It's the fire spreading now.

183
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,860
Yeah, whatever.

184
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,220
Well, that's going to wrap up this video.

185
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,660
My whole freaking house is burning down and nothing I can really do about it.

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,740
But if you liked this video, then click on that like button

187
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,060
and show Grandpa some support, baby.

188
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,259
And that's going to be it.

189
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,420
So I'll see you all later.

190
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,120
And bye.

191
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,459
I'll tell you the next time I play this game,

192
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,579
I'm going to have your goddamn fire extinguisher ready to go.

193
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,220
And not only that, I'm going to have a fucking phone next time

194
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,100
so I can call the police and my friends and stuff.

195
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,699
You'll see next time it's going to be a lot different.

196
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,819
I will make sure of that.
