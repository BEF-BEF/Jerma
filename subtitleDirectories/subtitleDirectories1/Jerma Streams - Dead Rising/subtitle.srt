1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:06,500
I was thinking about waiting. That was a bad thing to start with. I should have done that

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,099
before. That's why I'm muted. I had an opportunity to do that before the stream turned on. I don't

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,969
know what... I shouldn't be in control of this button. I was gonna wait till 1 pm, but I'm here.

4
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:22,809
I'm ready. I'm just ready to go. I don't need to wait till... I've been sitting here for like

5
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:30,620
five minutes just going like, you know, okay, I'm here. Let's just go early. Not even that early.

6
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:36,820
But still, we're here. Good afternoon. If you joined us last night,

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,299
today, I talked about how Dead Rising 1 was gonna be the stream today.

8
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:49,299
And I also made a mistake talking about how... what was gonna happen over the next couple days.

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:53,859
I told you I had a doctor's appointment tomorrow. That's not true. It actually is the next day.

10
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:03,159
So, uh, I believe this game takes somewhere between 10 to 12 hours to do it. 13 hours.

11
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:10,060
So we're gonna do this today, and we're gonna do this tomorrow. I will then go to my doctor's

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:18,760
appointment. So we're gonna bang out Dead Rising the next two days in a row. This is a two-hour

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:30,700
game. No, it is not. This is not a two-hour game. Yeah, what I know about Dead Rising, at least the

14
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,879
original. In fact, all the Dead Rising, it doesn't matter which one it is. I've collectively played

15
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:46,379
maybe six and a half hours of all of them combined. Dead Rising 1, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 3.

16
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,329
So, I mean, I know how the game kind of works. I've played it off and on a couple of times,

17
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,890
randomly, 60% of the way through somebody else's playthrough on a couch.

18
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,109
Dude, take this! You guys, try Dead Rising. You can throw CDs at people, and it's like,

19
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:06,709
CDs? What are you talking about? I remember grabbing the CDs,

20
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:12,469
and the phrase being CDs at zombies. And I also remember having like, there's like a Lego set.

21
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:18,680
That's the only thing I know. And you have a camera. So we're gonna just, I'm gonna play the whole

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,699
thing. Seems like one of those games that I should have done a long time ago. Um, no, but I had this

23
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:35,349
two videos of Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3. Maybe I'll just do them all. Not back to back,

24
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:40,120
but should I just play Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 3 eventually? Just play them

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,199
all the way through? Don't do Dead, there's a, wait, there's Dead Rising 4. Did I play Dead

26
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:59,219
Rising 4? I didn't remember. Did I? What's the one where you had to get the phone app from Microsoft

27
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:11,770
to like, call in an airstrike? Which one was that? Was that three or four? Three. Yeah, there was a

28
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,090
phone companion app that you could get for Dead Rising 3 to call in an airstrike from your phone.

29
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:26,460
Well, we'll see. But that's what we're gonna do today into tomorrow. That's the plan. And I'm

30
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:48,060
almost ready to go here. Just give me one more second and we'll get started. I don't know where

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:57,479
my lip balm is. This is bad. I mean, this, this is a, this is a total diva moment. I know, but like,

32
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:06,620
I can't, I cannot stream without my lip balm. It's not gonna, it's not possible. It's not possible.

33
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:15,460
I can't do it. It's the only way I can live stream. Where is it? I always have two balms right next

34
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:25,529
to me at all times. Whatever. Stream is canceled. Now, fuck it. Whatever. Let's go. I'll be all

35
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,889
right. Okay. So the stream sucks today. It's cause I didn't have lip balm on at the very beginning.

36
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:35,660
Don't forget that. All right. So I got everything ready to go. Start game. This is just going to be

37
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,720
Dead Rising 1. Let's see how fun it is. I heard it's fun. 72 hour mode. New game, right? That's

38
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,079
what I want to do, right? That means I have 72. That's three streams, three full days.

39
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,319
That's the one, right? Is this the PC? This is the PC version. Is that a bad thing?

40
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:09,420
No, no. Okay. So I'm just 72 hour mode. That's the one, right? September 19th, 11 at 27.

41
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:21,459
It was PM AM. Haven't you played this game? It's like randomly, like on a friend's couch.

42
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:37,930
I've never played through the whole game. Have I played through this game on camera? No, I don't

43
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,290
even guys. I've played like 12,000 games on stream and on video. I don't know. I have no idea.

44
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,610
Say buddy. No, I didn't. You mentioned something about research for a story. That's right. Got a

45
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,209
tip that something big's happening in a nowhere little town like that. They sure didn't mention

46
00:05:55,209 --> 00:06:01,910
anything about it on TV. Yeah. Well, I'm freelance pal. I don't make my living waiting for the TV

47
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,550
to play for on the street. Yeah, I kind of remember that.

48
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:27,430
Not this one. Population 53500 characteristics. Jack shit.

49
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,730
The only thing to do in this town is kill time at the shopping mall.

50
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,939
All right, every quiet. Everybody said anything. I'm talking to myself.

51
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:52,019
Was that the army? Yeah, I took a sip out of my water over here. That's been here since last

52
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,459
night and it tastes like hamburger meat. I don't know why that's fucked up. I had to share that

53
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:01,379
because that's strange. I want to get shots of the whole town before the national guard finishes

54
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:12,600
roping it off. Take me over the main street. Cooked hamburger meat. All right, here we go.

55
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:21,189
Oh, I can take pictures. How do I take a picture? Zoom in. Should I take a photo? Oh,

56
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:28,899
okay. That's zoom in. X is shutter. Got it. Oh, you got you get points. You did points for things.

57
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:34,980
Okay, move camera. Zoom in. I didn't there's enough picture of nothing. How do we zoom out?

58
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:46,920
There we go. Okay, so zoom in and zoom out. This is Pokemon snap. I need more stuff going on. Here

59
00:07:46,920 --> 00:08:06,579
we go. Zoom in. Nice brutality. Oh, wait. Action shot. Got it right when it was about to happen.

60
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,920
Damn it. I almost had it. Save this guy? Like, how am I supposed to save this guy?

61
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:27,160
Are they on the playground? No, zoom in. I would laugh so hard if one went down the slide. Wait,

62
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:35,830
here we go. He's gonna do it. Come on. Damn it. He didn't let go under the tire.

63
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:48,330
Oh, they're killing this guy. If I was just stayed on this,

64
00:08:48,970 --> 00:09:00,919
I could have reduced the sensitivity on this camera too. Wait, no genre. This is genre for

65
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:11,029
the photos and everything. Should I get a picture of the skyline? That's not bad. Right here. Right

66
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:27,610
down like Main Street. Are they saving these photos by the way? Oh, I have 17 photos remaining. Is

67
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:36,740
that what that is? Should I wait? That's kind of interesting. I mean, that's not interesting.

68
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:48,230
This is just a guy standing on a roof. That's not that interesting. No, I gotta get better

69
00:09:48,230 --> 00:10:03,190
on that. Perfect. I gotta make sure I get a good angle. Whoa, no, I got it.

70
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:30,980
I just barely got it too. What else we got? We're going up. Okay. Take a picture of your face.

71
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:50,220
I can't. Here we go. Wait, wait, wait. Somebody fighting. Nice. She's gonna fall off. She's gonna

72
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:59,419
fall off. She's gonna fall off. She's gonna fall off. I'm ready. I'm ready for the photo. Come on.

73
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:25,049
I'm gonna get it right here. Come on. And come on. Got it. Wait, that wasn't her.

74
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:51,460
I got it too nice. Off the titan trunk. Why is everybody calling me fucked up? What? This is

75
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:04,980
part of the game. I need to take photos and stuff. I'm a psycho. I can't save them.

76
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:18,659
Can you get me on? You gotta be kidding me. Man, you are nuts. Not with that attitude.

77
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,179
No, not with any. I got a camera in my hand. Don't forget to come back. We don't have like

78
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:34,019
grenade launchers in here. It's Frank. Frank West. Remember that name because the whole world's

79
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:41,830
gonna know it in three days. When I get confirmed for Smash Brothers on the next Nintendo Direct.

80
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:53,190
Now there it goes. A lot of helicopters flying really close.

81
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:21,100
Am I gonna make it jump for it? Get a photo of that one. Can I take a picture of this?

82
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,919
Big Bits came in. After the cutscene.

83
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,559
Gonna turn this up.

84
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:59,720
Didn't you? What did you see from the sky? Well, if it were just a riot,

85
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,139
I doubt the military would quarantine the entire area. The moratorium on information getting out

86
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,909
is a little extreme in my opinion. Frank is so ugly. What are you talking about?

87
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:17,450
Something else I can't put my finger on. What are you talking about? Doesn't sound like civil

88
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:26,700
disobedience. It's too quiet. Almost as if everyone's already dead.

89
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:34,090
Yeah, he looks like he's squished. So why don't you just tell me already?

90
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,320
What? Nope. All right, just listen to the cutscene. I think you'd better see for yourself.

91
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:53,190
This, my friend, is hell. Let's bring the camera up and just take a picture right in his face

92
00:14:53,909 --> 00:15:01,429
so I can remember who this person is. I'd be taking pictures of everybody I came across.

93
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:10,740
Can you stand right here for a second? Let me take a photo. Frank must be on the heliport

94
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,659
at 12 p.m. on the 22nd or he will be left behind in the mall.

95
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:23,500
Okay. Pay careful attention to the time as you play. So the check... No, it's not tab. There it is.

96
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:34,549
All right, so check watch is left on the d-pad. So it is 12 o'clock on the 19th. Oh, that's fast.

97
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:53,610
Check watch. Why do I have like a world news ticker down here? Okay. Check watch. What about it?

98
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,279
I don't need to... Why do I... I checked the watch already. Looks like you're the only journalist

99
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,659
that made it out of here. Okay. I'm looking forward to some nice pictures. Oh, wait. Hold on. How do

100
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:30,950
I take a photo? Good. Okay. Security room. Why did it just want to tell me to check my watch five

101
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:36,299
times? You can save your progress at locations marked with S such as the sofa in the security

102
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,500
room or the mall's public restroom. Okay. I can save in the bathroom or in the security room.

103
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:49,720
So you can save your progress at locations marked with S. So just the sofa in the security room.

104
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:59,379
What's in here? Change clothes. All right. I guess I'm a golfer now. All right. What do I want to be

105
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:13,240
dressed as? All right. I don't know. I want the golf. All right. All right. Okay. So that's cool.

106
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,400
Am I sprinting or is there a sprint button? Is there crafting in this one? I remember playing

107
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,349
like the third and fourth one. You had to make stuff. All right. Um, hold on. What's over here?

108
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,930
All right. I don't want to like waste time because I don't really have any time. How much time? I've

109
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,289
been walking around for 20 minutes. All right. I bet. Just save the game. Where's the security

110
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:48,920
room? Which one of these is the security room? Straight ahead. This is the janitor's room.

111
00:17:49,559 --> 00:18:25,289
What is this? I'm just wasting more time. What? Okay. All right. So that zero killed. Well,

112
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:34,549
actually one is killed. Uh, staff. I know. Where's the where's the actual security room?

113
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:44,740
Is it back here? Is it up the stairs? Where's the where's the security room?

114
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:54,410
The one with the green sofa. Which one of these had a green sofa? It's it's right here. There's

115
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:01,640
no security. It's not security room. This is the security room. I thought I had to go in one of the

116
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:18,359
one of the rooms was a security room. No, it's the security sofa. Okay. All right. Is there a

117
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:31,990
ladder? No. So what the fuck am I supposed to do? Just leave? Uh, I guess I'm going this way.

118
00:19:47,500 --> 00:20:07,720
Entrance. I've never played Dead Rising 1. I told you. I had somebody handing me the controller

119
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:22,329
like 17 hours into the game to throw CDs. Who the fuck is this guy? Who are these people?

120
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,269
She's like, she just tackled me twice.

121
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:31,980
Without my precious little sweetie doggie. Oh, where is my my doggy shield? All right. Mission

122
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:51,640
one. Save dog. Hey, this is no time to ogle pretty girls, son. You're looking to get yourself

123
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,200
beaten alive by zombies. Holy shit. This guy's eyes. Did you just say zombies? Take a look out

124
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:10,019
there. If those ain't zombies, what would you call them? They're gonna get in. Why is everybody

125
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,660
getting so close to your face? Yeah. One is just jumping right into your face. Since last night.

126
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Now, they're all that's out there. Hey, look on the bright side. Zombies are stupid and slow.

127
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:34,730
We should be safe in here. All right, then feel like making yourself standing in my shot. Take

128
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:41,099
a look around the mall. Bring anything we can use for the barricade back here. This barricade sucks.

129
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:45,740
You just threw a bunch of benches in the way. Where's the car that's parked in every mall?

130
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:51,400
Back the car up here. There's got to be at least two of them, right? All right. Find something.

131
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,740
Find something to block. All right. I don't have time for this. I'm on the clock right now. It's

132
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:09,339
been an hour. All right. Find something to barricade. Okay. It's drama. That guy's a gun. All

133
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:22,569
right. Whatever. Let's go. But I have to take photos of people. Hold on. Nice. More drama.

134
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,089
How many photos do I have? I don't want to just take photos of random shit. What's this?

135
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:42,970
Over the shoulder. Nice drama. Okay. I think I found something. I'm running around like a shit

136
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:53,910
myself. I'm fine. You right there. Do you have any idea what you've done? Why did you summon me to

137
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,549
this place? What are you planning? Would you calm down? I don't even know what you're talking about.

138
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:26,339
Can you open the door? I think they got in. No. So, it's the lady saving her dog is what starts

139
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:54,940
the whole outbreak here. I think the dog's a zombie. Okay. Well, there's so many character

140
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:08,650
introductions. What do I do? To the stairs. All right. I'm going. But what about everybody else

141
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:16,759
down here? HDTV. All right. Different items perform different actions. Some weapons are capable of

142
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,400
special attacks performed by holding X for a moment. You can attack or you can hold right

143
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,380
trigger and X's throw. Multiple items can be held in stock simultaneously. The maximum stock number

144
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:33,859
can be raised by leveling up. You can change the bumpers. Throw an item down. Down. Unequipped is

145
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:37,059
up. Okay. Sounds pretty simple enough.

146
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:56,009
Oh, no. It's dead. Kathy. Kathy, hold on a second. I'm coming. I'm coming. Kathy.

147
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:09,980
Stand behind me. Kathy. Yep. These things are scripted. They're supposed to die. It's scripted.

148
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:20,460
It's scripted. It's okay. You can't save them. This is scripted. You can't. Barley, come here.

149
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:24,390
What are you doing? Smoking a cigarette? What are you doing? Come here.

150
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:41,779
No, no. Get. What the hell? All right. You know what? It's scripted. It's scripted, right?

151
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:52,630
Whoa. When grabbed by multiple zombies, an escape command will appear on the screen.

152
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,390
None of the commands is directed before the time runs out and you can escape the dangerous situation.

153
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:13,430
Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I tried. Barley and Willis is dead. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

154
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:34,089
Watch out. I made it. All this because grandma wanted the dog. Yeah. Oh, I made it out. No, I

155
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:44,700
didn't. Where are the others? Imagine like a zombie apocalypse happens and the first thing that you

156
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,579
do is you grab a bench and just throw it. They got away. Just into everybody. Why would you do

157
00:26:49,579 --> 00:27:00,759
something like that? Like come up with a plan. A quick one. Not grab heavy object and throw into

158
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:14,680
friends because those things are in the mall. We better not use this door. Well, what are you

159
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:23,430
doing? The air ducks. They'll get us back into the mall and apparently those things aren't

160
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,869
smart enough to use the ducks so they won't be a factor. Wait a minute. You want to get back in

161
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:50,359
there? What for? He's gonna get grabbed. Hey. Nice camera. Are you a photographer?

162
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,859
No, no, no. Never ask anybody if they have a camera. They're a photographer. They're gonna

163
00:27:55,859 --> 00:28:12,549
talk your ear off for like two hours. Show me some pictures, Frank. You really seem to know what

164
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,700
you're doing. Wow. This is terrible. Who are you guys anyway? Why did you take pictures of people

165
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:46,309
falling off of the building? I don't know. I've never taken this costume off.

166
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:08,779
She wiped your SD card. Oh 70. What? It's already been two hours or an hour and like 10 minutes?

167
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:20,980
Okay, security room. Wait, is there like... I know you don't eat food. You do, right? How do you eat

168
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:29,579
it? Okay, so I'm gonna take coffee creamer. I'm gonna take two coffee creamers. I can't answer.

169
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:39,849
Okay, I gotta... Okay, what's up? You're planning on going back down into the mall, are you? I

170
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:44,650
wouldn't do that if I were you, but you young... Well, if you're gonna do it, at least take this.

171
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,650
Transceiver with you. And you better take this. You obtained the mall map. You obtained the

172
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:56,900
transceiver. All right. You obtained the mall map. Okay, so how do I use it? Well, how do I...

173
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:04,569
Should I just go in? I'm going... Go in? Any quests or anything? I'm just going in. I didn't save the

174
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:26,309
game. Fuck. Whatever. I'll be fine. This is a timed game. I can't just like dilly dally. Okay,

175
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:38,299
I'm on the roof. Jeff! Jeff! Come here. You! Have you seen my wife, Natalie? She should still be

176
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:45,960
around here. Hey, hey, hey! I'll lend a hand. That's a pretty good weapon. Fellow golfer, I see.

177
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:54,019
The name's Jeff Mayer, by the way. I'm Frank. I'm telling you, that back nine here is killer.

178
00:30:56,089 --> 00:31:00,730
Escorting survivors. Survivors each behave differently depending on the circumstances

179
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:06,500
and their own varying personalities. It was a good idea to escort as many as possible to the

180
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,859
safety of the security room. Call survivor or set goal marker. Okay, so that's right triggered in

181
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:19,539
Y. So Y is to be like, come here. Okay. Okay, join. So... Follow me! All right, so follow me.

182
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:30,839
We're gonna find... gonna find your wife is around here somewhere. Follow me! Natalie,

183
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:41,220
found you. Come on, Jeff. I don't know how you guys even got separated. It's an open spot. It's an

184
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:55,079
open space. Wait, wait, hey, hey! Okay, let's go. I'll never let you go again. We have to go now.

185
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:02,089
It's not safe. I know a place. I'll take the security room. Once the number of photos taken

186
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:05,289
exceeds 30, they'll begin to be deleted in order automatically. You can save any photo from the

187
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,769
imminent deletion by switching to keep Y in the picture viewer. What? All right, let's go. Come

188
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:16,890
on. Come on. Let's go. PP prestige points are awarded for actions such as escorting survivors

189
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,650
to safety or defeating zombies, right? When the PP gauge becomes full, Frank levels up,

190
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:30,170
right? Attack power increases. Speed is running speed. Life is maximum. Health stock is item stock.

191
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:35,299
Throw is item throw distance. And new skill mastered is a new skill learner as it does it

192
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:43,960
automatically, I assume. All right, come on. Both of you, let's go. What are you doing? Come here.

193
00:32:43,960 --> 00:33:03,049
Hurry up. I'm on the clock right now. Please, hurry up. What are they doing? What? Why won't

194
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:15,769
they follow me? What's going on? Talk to them? I can't. Oh, I just fucking backhanded. Why can't

195
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:25,609
I talk to them? Okay, we're good. Hurry up. No, I let's go. All right, we're good. We're good.

196
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:38,859
I didn't even hit the punch button. All right, to safety. It's up here. Follow me this way. Come

197
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:49,849
on up. Can she make it? Come on, Natalie. Hurry up. All right, go in there. No, no, no, no, no, go.

198
00:33:50,980 --> 00:34:01,380
Just call me a bitch. No, get in here. Did they go in? Okay, good. I'm never going to the mall

199
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:08,570
again as long as I live. I've had about enough of this. Escort complete. Freddy Dread just gave

200
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:15,269
5,000 bits. All right, on time to go back out. Level up. No, no, no, no, no, no. Save the game.

201
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,940
Anything else in here? Through here? No message from Freddy Dread, just a shitload of money. Thank

202
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:41,699
you, Freddy Dread. Seriously. Okay, I'm good. Yes, overwrite. Mid to late game, hand to hand is nuts.

203
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:48,900
All right, hold on. Give me another apple. Okay, I have two coffee creamers, an apple, and a golf

204
00:34:48,900 --> 00:35:00,809
club. All right, let's go. All right, I saved the first two people. Go down the elevator.

205
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:15,860
I guess I'm going to go down. I learned jump kick. Nice. Somebody calling me? Hey, it's Otis,

206
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,460
back in the security room. Can you hear me, Frank? Let me give you a rundown of the mall's layout

207
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,110
so you know what you're doing. Right, on the other side of the warehouse, you'll find Paradise Plaza.

208
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,389
There's lots of shops. There are restaurants, sporting goods, books. It's a pretty big mall,

209
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:34,869
so you probably need to use the can now and then. Just check the... What was it, left? What was it?

210
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:43,769
Which button was it? I don't know. People are talking too fast. Stop. Frank, are you there?

211
00:35:43,769 --> 00:36:13,300
It's me, Otis the janitor. He just called me. Why did you have to hang up and call again? Hey.

212
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:28,150
It's probably just a sprain. Oh. You've got to help Brad, or he's done for. All right,

213
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:36,019
she's a zombie. Give me your gun. I'm the reason you just got hurt. Let me help. No, I can't let a

214
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:41,780
civilian do that. That's against regulations. Yeah, well, I don't think they had zombie-infested

215
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:48,900
malls in mind when they wrote those regulations, kid. You know how to use this? No idea. Absolutely

216
00:36:48,900 --> 00:37:04,949
not a clue at all. I've covered wars, you know. See, at this point when I hold it backwards and

217
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:08,630
aim with the handle forward and go, just use this thing, I don't know, and then you like

218
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:20,469
wink at the camera, and then you go, you scoff and you walk away. All right, case one. September

219
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:28,599
19th from 12 p.m. Case one, two. Okay. The case panels form a guide to solving the mystery behind

220
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,199
the incident. When you encounter a key event, a new case panel opens, taking you one step closer

221
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:43,480
to the truth. New development. The case. You've been handed a gun. You can take a look at the

222
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,880
current status of the case panels via the case file option on the pause menu, okay?

223
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:52,699
When all the case panels have been filled in, the truth behind the incident will be revealed.

224
00:37:54,679 --> 00:38:03,539
All right, so it's open right now. So this is like the story. Back up for Brad. Don't cut me off

225
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:07,539
like that. It's rude. Anyway, here's what I was going to say. There's some young guy wandering

226
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:13,190
around in Paradise Plaza. He's carrying a camera like you. I guess he must be a photographer too,

227
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:21,369
taking pictures at a time like this. You're both crazy. Scoop queue. The scoop queue provides a list

228
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:26,309
of current requests along with relevant information on survivors. If you're able to fulfill the

229
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:31,030
objective laid out in the scoop queue before time runs out, you can receive PP or learn more about

230
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:39,400
the incident. So if you look at your watch, backup for Brad has more than six hours. If it's yellow,

231
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,840
it means it's less than six hours. And if it's red, it means it's less than three hours.

232
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:51,349
And then if it's gray, there's no time limit at all. Okay, so by setting a guide arrow,

233
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:56,070
you'll be able to more easily navigate your way to a given goal. Guide arrows can be set via the

234
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:03,019
watch screen or the map screen. Access via the pause menu. Okay, so when you open your watch,

235
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:11,940
it'll tell you where to go. Interesting. Backup for Brad. So here we go. Backup for Brad is

236
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,900
currently selected. I can select. Cut from the same cloth. I got time to do Brad. All right,

237
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,420
cut from the same cloth is currently on. I can get rid of the coffee creamer. And all right,

238
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:34,949
here we go. I'm ready. Let's go. Backup for Brad. No, not backup for Brad. Cut from the same cloth.

239
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,019
All right, gotta go this way. We have six, less than six hours.

240
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:53,690
Holy fuck. I just ended that person. Okay. Is it up top? All right, I gotta go up. Is there an

241
00:39:53,690 --> 00:40:08,780
escalator stairs? That's fun. Going to the toy store? Oh, not yet. I only have six hours.

242
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,860
I have six hours to do this. I gotta find the photographer.

243
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:30,949
Got it. All right, this person's a gun. Hey you, you're in my way. Can't you see I'm hard at work?

244
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:35,619
I'm trying to take some pictures here. You've got a nice camera there yourself, but you know the

245
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:44,039
first thing about photography? Uh, yeah. Sorry about that. You know, I happen to be a pro too.

246
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:49,300
Maybe not as good as you, but you think you're professional, huh? All right, got you.

247
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:55,050
Do you really appreciate the way to the word professional carries? If you don't have the

248
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:04,389
talent, you can't just use that word like you own it. All right, so what do I do? Have to give him

249
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:12,519
like a good photo? Name's Frank Wesser. I got in way of your shot. I'll just get out of your hair

250
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:18,809
now. Okay, okay. Hang on a sec, buddy. Why don't I do you a favor? I'll have a look at your technique

251
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,960
and give you some pointers. Okay, don't be shy now, Frankie. Here, I'll even model for you.

252
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:29,639
Show me what you can do and I'll be the judge. What a great idea, huh? Sometimes I think I'm

253
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:36,920
a genius. Let's get started. Well, let's go. I'm on the clock right now. What? When taking photos,

254
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:43,079
note that the larger of the target marker, the more PP you will gain from that photo. Also,

255
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,760
if you manage to take a photo while attacking while being damaged or in some of the non-standard

256
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,599
status, the target marker will change to red, indicating an increase in potential PP. Okay,

257
00:41:54,969 --> 00:42:01,460
right. The color of the target marker indicates the genre of the photo. The

258
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,619
genre that nets the most PP will take precedence over other genres that could be included in said

259
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:13,619
photo. Sexually stimulating images, horrifying images, humorous images, emotionally stirring

260
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:21,219
and violent images. All right. So, okay, first I want you to take a picture of me while I show

261
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:32,860
off my photography skills. What are you doing? Do it. That was fucking quick.

262
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:43,780
You did it. Nice job. I took a damn good one. Next, I'll treat you my signature cool pose.

263
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:56,519
You get 200, 700 PPs. Okay, what do you say we change the look out? He's going to die. Wait,

264
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:03,300
was I? You kind of not give me, you give me like, what are you doing? You're going to get killed.

265
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:23,659
He's going to die. Holy shit. That dodge. Get a good one of me. Perfect. No, he's doing like a

266
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:39,019
fuck. He didn't get it. Hey, I'm not posing over here for no reason. You got to take it.

267
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:59,400
What is he doing? That was not cool. That was really uncool. Okay. No, do you pose? There it is.

268
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:07,500
That's not drama. Am I in the frame? Hey, I'm not posing over here. No, you got to take it right.

269
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:30,309
Let me take a photo of you, please. All right. That's not his pose. All right. For the love of

270
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:43,699
God, stop. Do the thing you want to do. What do you, what do you mean it's no good? I'm not

271
00:44:43,699 --> 00:45:10,949
posing over here. No, you got to take it. You got to time it right. I need to get 700. This

272
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:26,329
vision is wonky. I'm wasting so much fucking time. Stop. Come here. All right. Do your thing.

273
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:48,820
No, you're trying to avoid the photo. He's not going to hurt me. That's not 700p. Okay. I have

274
00:45:48,820 --> 00:46:06,630
to leave. That's not working. He's just going to keep doing this. I have no, no, stop taking a

275
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:19,449
photo of me and help me. Help me. Take a picture, man. Don't you even know how I'm going to die.

276
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:34,889
What was that? So, okay. What am I doing? What am I doing wrong?

277
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:42,940
It doesn't make any sense. So people, everyone told me this was a wonky mission, but I don't

278
00:46:42,940 --> 00:47:19,380
understand. I need zombies in the photo. Okay. I can't, I'm trying this one more time and I'm

279
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:56,760
fucking just going to leave. What the fuck is going on? I just leveled up. I took like 30

280
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:30,360
fucking pictures. Why won't this complete? Okay. So is this mission impossible? Dude, my camera's

281
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,300
out of battery. I did it. Okay. I took, I took, I took a photo of you fucking a hundred times.

282
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:51,210
Well, it's in focus and I'm out of battery. Uh huh. That ain't half bad. Okay. Here comes the next

283
00:48:51,210 --> 00:49:02,519
one, Frankie. But first feast your eyes on my work. Now this is my most emotionally moving shot.

284
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:16,340
Now this is my sexiest shot. Uh huh. Uh huh. I have to go to the camera store. Fuck.

285
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:38,300
This is my most violent shot. Check it out. I've had a battery battery. Okay. Okay. Here's the deal,

286
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,460
Frankie. You got to go out there and take even better pictures than the ones I just showed you.

287
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:57,500
You think you can handle that? Huh? Yeah. Okay. Did it. So I have no battery in my camera.

288
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:05,079
So where's the camera? Where's the battery store? Is it back here? Somebody said the battery store

289
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:13,849
was down this way. There's a camera shop. There's a bat, a battery store. It's the first floor. All

290
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:29,530
right. That's kids clothing store. Right. Okay. I know. And this is like the funny thing to do.

291
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:45,289
Okay. Uh, let me look at the map. Where's the battery store? Okay. Hold on.

292
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:55,019
Child's play, kids clothes, jewels, warehouse, shoes, cams, cameras. All right. It's literally

293
00:50:55,019 --> 00:51:10,329
the next store down to the left. Two stores done. This doesn't do anything. Just get rid of it.

294
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:20,619
All right. Here it is down here. Jewelry store, cams, cameras. All right. What do I need? Batteries,

295
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:37,719
film. Do I need it? What? How do I get it? Camera store, camera batteries. Were they right at the

296
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:45,610
front? No. Oh, to stop. Somebody's barricaded a women's clothing shop. All right. That's fine.

297
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:49,610
It's two people are hiding. All right. I'm trying to pick up batteries. Leave me alone. Oh God.

298
00:51:49,610 --> 00:52:06,869
Damn it, man. Okay. I got scooped. Okay. Please. Oh my fucking God. No, that's not a gun. How do I

299
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:17,099
aim the gun? Battery power is depleted. Please charge the batteries. What the fuck? Where are

300
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:28,969
the batteries? Batteries. I just was over here. I didn't have an indicator when I went over there

301
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:40,500
last time. All right. Let's go to any of my watch. All right. Barricade pair. Hey, let's go that way.

302
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:55,510
What are you doing? I hear noise. I need something else besides an apple. I need like a weapon.

303
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:05,300
All right. What's in here? Let me go this way. Okay. There's a support store. What about here?

304
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:14,469
Anything in here? Like suits? Return clothes. What do I mean by return? Did I just put on a

305
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:30,539
pair of socks? Okay. This is I need something to use as a weapon. Okay. A hanger. That works

306
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:41,699
this way. Toy store. Wait, people are going to scream at me if I don't go in here.

307
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:54,039
All right. What's in the toy store? A novelty mask. Oh, okay. No, I want to change clothes.

308
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:02,409
All right. Okay. So I'm gonna put the I'm gonna have this on. I mean, this is this is funny,

309
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:08,539
right? You know, I'm doing like the funny thing. Hoomerang. Good. All right. Toy laser sword.

310
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:17,639
Um, all right. Replace the coat hanger. I'm ready. This is awesome. It makes a cool noise too.

311
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:27,829
Actually, it works pretty well. All right. What's over here? Barricade pair.

312
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:41,110
The outside? Where the hell are they? 67 hours. All right. Barricade pair A.

313
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:59,110
Oh, wait. Just take a real thing. Use an actual rip. I want. No, it's fine. All right. Backup for

314
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:18,090
Brad is still on there. I need to can I go faster than this? Run faster. I know I can run faster

315
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:25,960
than this. I need to upgrade. I need to upgrade my speed. So this is another section of the mall.

316
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:36,139
Okay. I get it. I need to get more PP. Okay. I got you. Just hold my hand.

317
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:56,090
Don't get surrounded. Don't get surrounded. That's stupid. Come on. Wait. I see a lawnmower.

318
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:59,690
That's way more important right now. I can get extra PP. I think I'm gonna. Okay. Lawnmower time.

319
00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:12,469
How do I drive a lawnmower? Do you have to eat a fucking apple?

320
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:23,210
Fuck. Okay. I need. Oh, this is bad. This is really bad. Really bad. Who just threw somebody?

321
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:39,099
Somebody throw that? How do I drive it? Ah. Shit. Not good. All right. It's over. It's over. It's

322
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:55,190
over. Otis. I found somebody in a jewelry shop. Okay. Yeah. It's on. They're in the cutscenes. I

323
00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:21,849
know. I look like a fucking moron. By the way, how many drugs are you on?

324
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:26,230
Ah. Shit load, man. Way too many.

325
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:53,690
Stay out of trouble. Are you up to it? I feel like I got picked up at a rave.

326
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:06,309
But yeah, I'll give it a shot. All right. Next time he reloads, I'll lay down a suppressing fire.

327
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:17,980
Coachella. I'm counting on you. Make your way over there. Okay. One. Let's go. Two. Three.

328
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:42,969
Do I have a sneak? Otis. Don't cut me off, Mike. Yeah, it's rude. Nope. That's not gonna work.

329
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:50,840
Otis, leave me the fuck alone. Don't cut me off. Anyways, I was saying. I don't know. Whatever

330
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,559
you're saying. And then somebody in the jewelry store. I know. I found a woman in the jewelry

331
00:58:53,559 --> 00:59:24,780
shop. Not a good time. Okay. She's moving around an awful lot. All right. Great. Oh, oh, oh. Which

332
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:51,460
window? Which window? Where's he going? Which window? Same one. Don't use that many bullets.

333
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:59,300
I don't want to use them all. He's got half health. Oh, shit. Shit. Hide. How do I, how do I duck?

334
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:43,289
Oh, fuck. God damn it. How did none of those hit? What the fuck? Wait. Frank this. That's a grenade.

335
01:00:44,889 --> 01:01:09,500
Where'd he go? I'm gonna climb up. No, no, no, no, no. Bad idea. All right. He's almost dead.

336
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:23,059
Is he shooting himself? He's shooting himself with a gun. He's gonna kill himself with a grenade.

337
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:33,530
What the fuck? Oh, shit. It was a decoy. How many, how many grenades do you have?

338
01:01:34,250 --> 01:02:04,619
I'm gonna go this way. Wrap around. He's gonna come over here. Run this way. Come on. Over here.

339
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:27,750
Bait him out. What is this guy doing? He's burning his hands on the gun. I shot first. Bullshit.

340
01:02:31,929 --> 01:02:40,789
I, excuse me. I don't understand. Um, I'm in trouble now. I was literally shooting him with

341
01:02:40,789 --> 01:02:48,820
the gun. Now what the fuck do I do? I'm gonna try, okay, I'm gonna throw the grenade back up

342
01:02:48,820 --> 01:03:03,820
to him. It's risky, but I'm gonna try it. Is that possible? Throw anything up there?

343
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:21,659
Can I throw the cash register up there? Shit. Okay, I think I can do it. Oh, shit. Wait. Corn.

344
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:32,710
All right, I'm gonna throw the bottle of Tabasco sauce at him. Right in the skull.

345
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:45,940
Where is he? Where is he? Is he still hiding? Can I get up there? What if I could sneak around

346
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:55,000
behind him? Wait a minute. I'm going up there. Come on. I can't do it. Let me get up here.

347
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:08,760
There's no way for me to climb up this. There has to be, right? Can't reach this. Oh, what about all

348
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:20,250
the way around? Yeah, I can get on these boxes, but can I go from here? Can I pick up the boxes?

349
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:47,480
I guess I can. Well, I can't go this way. Where the fuck is he? Where did he go? He's gonna unload

350
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:56,250
a clip on me. Imagine how embarrassing this would be having a guy sneak up behind you.

351
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:25,940
He's not, where is he? Where'd he go? Did he come jump down? He's behind me

352
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:52,360
in the restaurant over here. Is he the pair of pants? Is the bare pants? I can't, you can't hit

353
01:05:52,360 --> 01:06:18,010
the bare pants. Wait, this is fucked up. No, I need a better picture than this. Okay. Just

354
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:23,130
leave and come back. Well, I'm going to try to throw a table at the pair of pants. Not the barrel

355
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:39,050
right here. All right. I'm going to, I'll just Donkey Kong this guy. How did they, I thought

356
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:49,659
I was going to roll it. Just because I say something's going to happen doesn't mean it's

357
01:06:49,659 --> 01:07:24,090
going to happen. Okay. Kill him. Murder these fucking pants. Oh Jesus. I can't do anything

358
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:33,820
about this. That's not the boss. What are you talking about? So is he another pair of pants?

359
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:56,550
Okay. I'm going to leave and come out. Can I even leave? Okay. I'm going to leave and then go back

360
01:07:56,550 --> 01:08:14,650
in. Go look for the angry pants. Okay. Now. All right. Barricade. There he is.

361
01:08:18,739 --> 01:08:23,260
All right. What? I don't even have a weapon. I got to get a chair up there.

362
01:08:24,140 --> 01:09:00,659
He just killed himself with a grenade. They've evolved. Wait, why am I still holding a chair?

363
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:10,300
What? This motherfucker is still up here. Okay. I've got a chair up there. Chair is up there. I'm

364
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:16,279
going to kill him with the fucking chair. I'm sneaking up behind him. I'm going to bash his

365
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:39,939
fucking brains in. Where is he? He's gone again. What? If this is a pair of pants down here,

366
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:58,250
I'm going to be so mad. Uh, what, what am I supposed to do? What's wrong with my game? I

367
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:05,109
don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I, this is the first time I've ever

368
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:41,060
played this. So I leave and come back again. I hear something over here. I've wasted so much time.

369
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:54,279
Is he back? Okay. I need to just go up there and punch the fucking shit out of him. Don't,

370
01:10:54,279 --> 01:11:04,500
don't disappear. Okay. I got to keep my eyes on him. Okay. He's still talking. Good. Good, good,

371
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,699
good, good, good, good, good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's still up there. He's still up there.

372
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:11,300
He's still up there. He's still up there. He's shooting. Good. Excellent. Okay. Great.

373
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:27,670
Get this up. Chair up top. God damn it. Did he blow the chair up? I'm just punching him in the face.

374
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:50,600
Fuck it. This is ridiculous. Oh, this is so much fucking time wasted. Yeah. He just reloaded too.

375
01:11:50,600 --> 01:12:14,199
Why did he have to turn into pants? Brad? Where's Brad? Brad? Brad? Brad? Brad? Where's Brad?

376
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:21,720
Brad? Food? No, no, no. Go. Food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food, food.

377
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:28,789
Brad? Wait, Brad's the pair of pants. Brad's the pants. Brad's the pants. I gotta hide. I gotta

378
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:34,550
get the fucking food in here right now. Quick. Am I eating flour? No, eat the corn. Quick.

379
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:57,460
What am I doing? No. Okay. I'm just taking like fucking five frying pan. I have to end this.

380
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:06,779
I ran out of bullets. This sucks. How am I going to do this? Can I get ammo from Brad?

381
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:20,010
Okay. I'm going to spend the next 72 hours here. I can get ammo from Brad, but he sees a pair of

382
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:37,579
pants. He can't even talk. Where is he? Brad? I can't even track him down. Where'd he go?

383
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:53,109
He's a fucking pair of pants. Okay. Come here. Out of ammo. Take this. God. Holy shit.

384
01:13:54,090 --> 01:14:12,859
Give me a break. That only took like two to four full hours.

385
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:36,069
Okay. Who was that anyway? Well, thanks for your help. The name's Brad. I'm Frank West,

386
01:14:36,069 --> 01:14:40,310
photojournalist. And right now I'd rather have an explanation than your thanks, Brad.

387
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:55,880
You have a gross dad bod. Sorry. I've got nothing to tell you. Look, I do have something to tell you

388
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:02,550
what Jesse told you. But as far as I'm concerned, we're through working together. So you cover your

389
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:16,329
zombie story and leave the rest to us. You guys are looking for someone here, aren't you? Who is

390
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:29,100
that? Where did you take it? You help me, I help you. The rat man. Phylactery lich, $50, 5,000 bits

391
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:38,380
from Phylactery. Thanks a lot. Huge money. Damn. Thank you again, Phylactery. You're one hell of

392
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,819
a journalist, aren't you, Frank? They say all the times I've played this, I've never seen Brad turn

393
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:45,659
into a pair of pants. By the way, get used to being on time crunch because you probably won't

394
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:49,979
be able to do everything. Nothing better to do than to invade people's privacy. Well, I'm already

395
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:58,199
like four hours behind already. I try. You got a point. But thank you for the 5,000 bits though,

396
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:14,789
seriously. You win, Frank. Let's work together. Jesse and I are DHS agents. And yes, we are looking

397
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:20,949
for the man in that picture. You're with Homeland Security. Is that guy a terrorist or something?

398
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:31,619
I took that picture in the entrance plaza. Right near the front door.

399
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:42,069
The entrance plaza. You're sure? Hey, I gotta save the picture. Do I have permission to cover this

400
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:59,399
story or not? Okay. Case one. All right. Case one three. Engaged. Psychopath defeated. Barricade

401
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:11,420
pair A is still live. New skill mastered. You mastered the zombie ride skill. Should I follow

402
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:22,250
Brad? Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Picture viewer. Keeping this one. Any

403
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:28,680
others that I want to keep? Okay. Just look at this. Look at how many times I did this.

404
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:37,510
Wrong. Let's go. I want to, you know what? Fuck it. I want, I want to see. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

405
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:47,960
Wrong, apparently. Wrong. No, they weren't. They were correct. This is the, where's the right one?

406
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:57,460
Okay. This is the correct one. This is the wrong one. No, this is the correct one. This one's

407
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:10,579
incorrect. I don't, I don't get it. Now let's go Brad. That's a great, I like how it stops.

408
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:22,550
All right. I'm going to barricade pair A. I still can do that. Nice shot. All right. This

409
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:35,500

01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:50,340
surrounded, man. Don't die. Brad. Okay. They're in here. They're right there. They're right there.

411
01:18:50,340 --> 01:19:00,170
Hey, let me in. Let me in. What? Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. Somebody help me.

412
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:10,600
Nice. Dammit. Just what I need. Another crazy person harassing me. No, no, no, no, no, no.

413
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:15,960
Oh, it's because of the mask. I have a mask on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

414
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:28,890
It's because of the mask. Hold on. All right. Stay away from me. I am fucking crazy. You know

Give me this. What am I doing? What? I have to carry this person?

437
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:26,979
Barry, please. You're blocking the way. He's alive. He's alive. He'll be okay.

438
01:24:29,779 --> 01:24:34,260
He's fine. He's good. I'm gonna give him some. I'm gonna give him the food. Where's the food?

439
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:46,039
Oh, it is. Hey, there's a space rider machine in Wonderland. It looks fun. Don't die.

440
01:24:48,069 --> 01:25:01,800
Fuck everybody. I'm out. Have you ever ridden a roller coaster? I'm gonna die. I can't. I can't.

441
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:17,340
You're dead. I don't care. I can't help you. Hang up the phone. Get over here. Get up. Up, up,

442
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:20,619
up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Otis, I don't care about anything you're saying right now.

01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:50,890
All right. Where's Brad? Brad. It's fucking over, man. There's too many of them. Hey, pick me up a

444
01:25:50,890 --> 01:26:13,449
large iced coffee on the way back, could you? Okay. Let's go. Are you gonna? Now what? Are you

445
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:42,170
gonna open the door? Why? I lost two people. I know. Unfortunate. I need to get down for a

446
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:46,970
second. Space rider machine in Wonderland Plaza looks like it's out of control. That's weird.

447
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:57,350
All right. I'm gonna bring it back. So where is the security room? It's somewhere over here,

448
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:05,670
isn't it? Oh my God. What the fuck do you want? I didn't even cut you off. You hung up first. You

449
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:19,430
hung up on me. You got Alzheimer's or something, man. Okay. Thanks for calling again. All right. I

450
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:28,250
need to bring you back. Where's the security room? All right. Look, I need the security room. Where

451
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:41,130
is it? Does it have like a different? This is the food court here. This is the warehouse. Okay. So

452
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:48,859
I need to go just down the hall and to the right. So down here and a little bit to the right. No,

453
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:53,579
my God. Why are we doing this? Sir, if you could just kindly come with us, we can wrap this whole

454
01:27:53,579 --> 01:28:00,310
thing up. No, I'm leaving until you can guarantee me safe passage. Just open this gate. Just open

455
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:04,390
this gate for your protection. I am not opening any gate. He's trying to see through the bottom of

456
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:20,279
the mask. Dr. Barnaby. Sir. Dr. Barnaby. Well, what happened? You can't just arrest him.

457
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:25,579
He turned down my offer to protect him, said he isn't going anywhere until I can guarantee

458
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:33,460
a secure route out of here. Jesse has a direct line to HQ. That's like the first thing we need

459
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:38,260
to do in anime. If they, if I was in a costume in anime and somebody said something, it would

460
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:42,020
zoom into the inside of the costume and I'd be like, oh my God, I'd have a bunch of reactions in

461
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:59,850
here. Somebody gave a 10,000 bits like 10 minutes ago. Oh, that was Gibbler. Thank you for the

462
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:07,130

463
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:11,210
The Thing again. Wait, I was mistaken. Sorry about that. Hope to see you play The Thing again soon.

464
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:18,520
That's thanks for the thing money. Appreciate it. Thank you, Gibbler, though. That thanks for the

465
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:24,279
there's been huge money drops today already. So thank you all of you. All right, case one,

466
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:30,380
we're almost done with case one. Frank, right now you're in the entrance plaza.

467
01:29:31,180 --> 01:29:34,939
Looks like you got the shutter open. If you want to change it to some fresh duds, just

468
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:55,899
hang up on you. What? What did he say? Fresh changes from fresh duds. Can I go up? What did

469
01:29:55,899 --> 01:30:04,260
he what is it? Was there like a out of control? A temporary agreement was almost done. You're

470
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:13,579
almost finished with the first part. Yeah. But so what did he say? Where can I go? I need to like

471
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:24,149
get back to the safe zone. Go to Paradise Plaza. Because I know I got to go this way and into the

472
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:32,060
right. Because I need to go to the warehouse. Yeah, I got to go to the warehouse. So is it

473
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:37,020
this way? Wait, no, it's not. Where the fuck am I going? Is it this way and into the right? Or is

474
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:48,220
it up the stairs? Everyone scream if I'm going the wrong way. Alright, everyone's screaming.

475
01:30:48,939 --> 01:30:53,930
Alright, so no, okay, let's turn around completely. And then it's to the right.

476
01:30:54,569 --> 01:31:04,310
Okay, so it's up that way. Everyone got timed out because he's going the wrong way.

477
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:18,340
So then this way. Can I even get in here? Does this even open? This shit don't even open. I have

478
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:27,479
to go up the stairs in that way. Okay. To go all the way back around. Oh shit. Okay. That's annoying.

479
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:31,399
Go to the arrow. Well, I'm not. I'm not trying to go to the arrow. I'm trying to go to the

480
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:44,340
safe zone. Is that gonna is that taking me to the safe zone? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

481
01:31:45,720 --> 01:32:00,140
Okay, so where's the from here? Where is it? So now I gotta go. Do I have to do this? Current

482
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:07,289
mission is back to the safe zone. So yes, he follows the arrow. Oh, but fuck it's right here.

483
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:15,750
So I follow the arrow. I keep getting fucking phone calls. Just go. Okay, I'm just gonna call

484
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:29,739
the arrow. The door is welded. It's a dead end. Alright, alright, alright, alright. So I have to

485
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:40,600
go back down. I'm getting confused here. Downstairs and then that way. That's the way I was going.

486
01:32:41,399 --> 01:33:11,979
I'm not gonna throw her off the ledge. What the fuck? Why so dark? Oh, it's because it's

487
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:20,229
nighttime. Holy shit. I have like no time left. All right, grandpa. If you but dial me one more

488
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:32,970
time, I swear to God. It's like, if I were to go and get my computer infected with a bunch of

489
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:37,689
viruses to make sure that I got scam phone calls. And I mean, I mean, go to every website and give

490
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:42,010
my phone number to every single website. That is like a scam site. I wouldn't get called this much.

491
01:33:42,970 --> 01:34:09,300
All right, almost there. Okay, I remember this. I have to go all the way. Wait, wasn't I back here

493
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,060
Where are they even going from here? Really? Oh, all right, I have to stop this.

494
01:34:46,859 --> 01:35:09,800
Do I still have my gun? It's scripted. I can't save him. Are they in the car?

495
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:19,239
Where's the car? All right, this is actually concerning. I don't have any heals or anything.

01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:49,479
of the game. Will load game? Just always load. Always load. This game is not easy. That's all

505
01:37:49,479 --> 01:37:54,550
right. If you restart, you keep your level. Oh, my God. This is like, I feel like I'm going to pick

506
01:37:54,550 --> 01:38:01,539
the wrong door here. Do not load. Load the game. Do not save it. Save the game. You idiot. Load it.

01:38:51,220 --> 01:39:00,789
beginning of the game. Oh, my God. Okay. So, speed run time. Holy shit.

511
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:21,020
Save the game every 15 minutes. Okay. Hey, welcome everybody. Hope you're having a good day.

512
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:44,460
Let's go. Is there a way I can turn the telephone off? I've already seen this. All

513
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:52,180
right. We're speed running this. Holy shit. I did not realize that it was this big of a deal.

514
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:56,340
There's no autosave or anything. There's no restart from like check. No, it's just,

515
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:59,779
it's just maybe this game's like 12 years old. All right. Again. All right. All right. Let's go.

516
01:39:59,779 --> 01:40:07,060
Let's go. Oh, my God. This is awful. This is really bad. I did. Okay. I didn't realize how awful this

517
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,579
was. This is, this is like a catastrophe, but it's not, I'm fine. Everything's gonna be fine.

518
01:40:10,579 --> 01:40:22,649
It wasn't that bad. I know exactly where I'm going. Back up for Brad. What? I can't get in here?

519
01:40:23,369 --> 01:40:32,939
No, I know there wasn't an autosave, but I didn't realize that like it, it wasn't,

520
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:37,340
it was kind of, oh, I don't know. I thought I could like potentially start at like where,

521
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:41,739
I have no idea. This game's hardcore. So we're going to treat it that way. How did you even

522
01:40:41,739 --> 01:40:47,300
grab me? That's right. What? I don't understand. Where'd you even come from? What? All right. Back

01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:53,770
up for Brad. Let's go. Photo guy. Photo quest. All right. I'll get, where was that? Up top?

524
01:40:54,489 --> 01:40:59,529
I don't remember. I'm so disjointed right now. I'm like right now, I am so miserably sad,

525
01:41:00,489 --> 01:41:04,569
but I'm bottling it up. I'm just, I just drank it. I just gulped it down. It's going to come out

526
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:07,689
as diarrhea in like fucking four hours, but we're good. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. We're good.

527
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:14,920
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Hey, what's going on, man? No, that's the wrong

528
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:22,199
one. Yeah. I can, I can take photos. I'm going to get it immediately. First try. Yeah. I'll do it.

529
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:35,689
Oh my God. I'm saving the game. Literally. I want everyone to scream in this chat.

530
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:54,539
Like I want it to only say, save the game every 20 minutes. All right, let's go. Okay.

531
01:41:55,779 --> 01:42:06,140
Photo time. Model for you. Yep. I'll be able to get through this very quickly.

532
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:15,189
Okay. Here we go. Take a photo. Look at all these cool things. Awesome. Huh? Show me your skills.

533
01:42:15,189 --> 01:42:24,310
Got it. Nice, huh? That's no good, man. Got you. Okay. Cool. Food. Give me some pies.

534
01:42:26,619 --> 01:42:35,189
What? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cool pose. Cool pose. Here it is. No, I fucking didn't,

535
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:43,800
I didn't mean to press X. All right. Here we go. One, two, three, take it. And I did it wrong.

536
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:48,439
It's gotta be right when he pumps his fist. Don't run away. No, I'm not reliving the same

537
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:52,779
thing that just happened. Please God. I don't want to do the whole thing again. I just want,

538
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:58,979
it's right when his fist goes down. We just did this like this whole stream.

539
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:35,100
Do it. What are you doing? I'm just reliving the same day. Take it.

540
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:42,439
That's not, it's a different, that was a different pose. Oh, you've got to be

541
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:47,800
fucking kidding me. This is fucking Groundhog Day. Give me a break. Okay. Please do it.

542
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:09,060
Got it.

543
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:35,699
Get the kick. Yeah. It's like, it's a half, it's like a tenth of a second.

544
01:44:36,659 --> 01:45:06,500
It's 3000 points. Okay. Good. See you later. Okay. Bye. Damn it, man. I, I already did this.

545
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:14,220
Why did I not? I'm gonna make a post-it note that says like, oh, no, no.

546
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:32,890
And I have to do this stupid ass mission again. What is, what the fuck? Why, man?

547
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:45,130
And that was perfect. He's covering his face. Cool. Good.

548
01:45:49,859 --> 01:45:58,039
Thanks. Save the game now. Where's our safe point? I want to say point now, right now.

549
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:17,939
There's not even one around me. There's a bathroom. Where's the bathroom? No bathroom here. Oh, what?

550
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:23,619
Why is that not the default? Oh God. It's not, it's first floor. Okay. First floor.

551
01:46:23,619 --> 01:46:29,779
Go down. Bathroom. First floor. Let's go. All right. Brad, you're gonna have to just wait a

552
01:46:29,779 --> 01:46:43,420
minute. I'm gonna do this correct. All right. Bathroom. Where's the, where's the bathroom?

553
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:55,560
Not that way. Not that way. Where is it? It's behind me. It's just behind me. And what, up the

554
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:11,579
stairs? It's all the way down. What do you mean blind? I couldn't see through here. What are you

555
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:32,119
talking about? All right. We're good. Give me this. Good. Change clothes. Who cares? All right. Here

556
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:42,779
we go, Brad. I'm ready. All right. So I gotta remember it's a cross from Bachman's Bookporium.

557
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:50,340
Oh, all right. That's the comedy thing. Didn't know that. All right. Let's go, Brad.

558
01:47:51,140 --> 01:48:07,779
God damn it. I'm so sad. I'm so sad. My words can't describe my sadness.

559
01:48:08,659 --> 01:48:15,140
I missed the katana. It's all right. I need to, I need to get to the point where I just was.

560
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:26,789
Any bosses yet? I think there's been two, but we've rewound an hour and 40 minutes. I blame,

561
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:35,689
I blame, what was her name? Lucy? I had two guys that had like weapons and then they both died

562
01:48:35,689 --> 01:48:46,500
because we were rescuing Lucy from the jewelry store. And then I got run over by a car. Did I

563
01:48:46,500 --> 01:49:02,260
beat the thing? Oh yeah. I'm going to be under leveled, under leveled. Wait, this is my opportunity.

564
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:07,539
This is a new timeline so I can try the, I always said flamethrower. New timeline. All right. How

565
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:24,310
do you work it? You have to hold X. Okay. Good. Okay. Good. I'll make it up for the lost PP that

566
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:49,539
I had. Where's the knife? I need that knife. All right. Let's go. All right. Get off. And

567
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:58,859
another one with the knife. Where's the knife? Right there. Just don't waste bullets. Just grab

568
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:16,550
the knife. All right. I'm up. It's only 67 hours left. Okay. I have some extra PP. Get through. Oh,

569
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:24,979
you fucker. Come on. No, don't. Food core. Here we go. All right. I'm ready.

570
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:34,329
Not going to screw this up. I'm just going to win. Don't just fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. I have

571
01:50:34,329 --> 01:50:50,779
two guns. You can't even hurt it. You can't even hit him. He's unhittable until he stands up.

572
01:50:50,779 --> 01:51:24,489
Where's he at? Fast. Just do it and I'll be almost there. Ammo. Where'd he go? He's over here, right?

573
01:51:26,970 --> 01:51:42,600
Rad ammo. Holy shit. Wait, that's fun. Hold on. That's fun. That's fun. I want to do that.

574
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:50,220
You know, this is actually going to be a good thing because I'll beat him quickly.

575
01:51:50,779 --> 01:52:45,659
Okay. I didn't hit him with any. Is he healing? What the fuck was that? Oh, almost dead. Almost

576
01:52:45,659 --> 01:52:49,220
dead. It's okay. It's all right. Don't worry. I would say. All right. All right. All right.

577
01:52:49,220 --> 01:53:07,140
Don't be fucking greedy and cocky here. Heal just in case. It's this. It's this. It's this. It's

578
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:24,659
the success ringing of the telephone. It's like, I just leave me alone. Why would I answer this

579
01:53:24,659 --> 01:53:53,560
phone call right now? Ammo please. Okay. Thanks for the tip. Right. I know. But scoops. Cool.

580
01:53:53,560 --> 01:54:13,720
Great. Can I have ammo? Thank you. Somebody just like tap. Okay. Somebody just muted by stream and

581
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:37,340
then unmuted it. This game is freaking me out. Okay. Go. Where's the safe point? Right here.

582
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:43,460
There are sanity effects in the game. That's not true. Okay. Safe point. Right here. Out.

583
01:54:43,460 --> 01:55:14,659
Bang of right. This is a place called flexing. You got it. Yeah. Flexing. Where is it? Okay. It's

584
01:55:14,659 --> 01:55:33,350
out. It's going to go this way straight and this is right. Flexing. There it is. How do I save it?

585
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:55,079
I have almost officially caught up with myself. Whoa. Okay. I have weapons. I'm going to try to

586
01:55:55,079 --> 01:56:16,920
save everybody now. I think I'm just going to leave Lucy. Watch it. Watch it. Okay. Where are

587
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:25,210
they at? Do I even have that data? I do. They're right here. Okay. All right guys. Come on out.

588
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:39,899
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Get. They're in a different store. They're in this store

589
01:56:39,899 --> 01:56:55,140

590
01:56:55,779 --> 01:57:21,819
Oh fuck. Okay. Let's go. Give me your food. Everyone's all good. Knock it off.

591
01:57:22,539 --> 01:57:39,479
Talk to me or kill me. Okay. All right. Aaron. Let's go. Good. Join the party. Bert Thompson

592
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:48,140

You take dumbbell. Okay. Give me the bat. No. You idiot. Why don't you eat those? Here. Take the.

594
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:03,619
Come here. You have to get out of the way. Those are my rice crispy treats.

595
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:13,479
All right, fellas. You ready? No. Give me that. You got it. No. You give me this.

596
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:40,569
I. Well, it doesn't matter. Let's go. Three Stooges episode. Bert. Aaron. Anytime now. Did you block

597
01:58:40,569 --> 01:58:51,050

600
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:10,890
No, that's. Is it food in here? It's a restaurant. There has to be food in here. Cooking oil.

601
02:00:12,630 --> 02:00:22,859
Nope. Here we go. Orange juice. Drink the cooking oil. I'm not going to drink it.

602
02:00:23,579 --> 02:00:58,489
Let's go. Good. We both made it. Here we are. Both here. Everyone here. Found somebody in the

603
02:00:58,489 --> 02:01:04,810
jewelry shop. Oh, did you? Oh, just missed it. So she's looking for somebody. Just missed it.

604
02:01:05,609 --> 02:02:07,350
What she called earlier. Let's go. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

605
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:26,180
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I know. I know. I know. You got separated from the kid. I know it's bad.

606
02:02:26,979 --> 02:02:30,260
Aaron. That's my baby. I know. Okay. Yep. Yes.

607
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:46,869
We'll help you. Come on. Aaron. They ate her. Okay. Yes. Oh, God. I know. Goodness.

608
02:02:50,539 --> 02:02:54,489
Good. Thank you. Stick around for a little bit. I don't have any more weapons.

609
02:02:55,050 --> 02:03:00,569
Okay. Sure. Come on. I'm not gonna let you die here. All right. And three, two, one. Action.

610
02:03:01,529 --> 02:03:19,800
How do I get out of here? You... Guys, how do you...

611
02:03:37,770 --> 02:03:50,069
Just trapped in here. He's just facepalming. Get away from the counter. Come on. Stop. I trapped

612
02:03:50,069 --> 02:04:23,060
him. I'm gonna scream. Does she not know how to climb? How do I get her out of here? Let's go.

613
02:04:23,779 --> 02:04:42,470
You guys are the ones that have the weapons. Fellas. Oh, my God. What are we doing here?

614
02:04:43,430 --> 02:05:09,829
Are they seriously stuck there? They are. Brad, I'm... I traded.

615
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:20,149
Fuck. No. Go... You go over there and stay over there?

616
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:53,770
I can get there in time. Where the hell are they? Where are they? Where are they?

617
02:06:07,319 --> 02:06:17,720
He's just falling. Let's go this way. Me? To me. To me. This is un-fucking-believable. I'm gonna

618
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:39,510
throw a sofa in there. I have to throw a chair or something at him. I'm gonna get trapped in here.

619
02:06:40,859 --> 02:07:09,239
Can I pick him up? Yes, I saw this already. Go that way. How do I just punch? That's why. Come

620
02:07:09,239 --> 02:07:20,500
this way. This AI. Holy shit. You guys are brainless. Finally, Brad. Bert, you got up.

621
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:23,909
I wonder... All right. Good. Nice work, everybody. Now move.

622
02:07:24,869 --> 02:07:31,579
Don't care. Go. Come on. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. Come on.

623
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:35,340
I got orange juice when you're done. Give me that weapon. Trade me.

624
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:45,210
Heal with the orange juice. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Out. Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

625
02:07:45,210 --> 02:07:51,609
Leia's being attacked. I swear to God, if I die here, I am going to fucking throw them. Throw them.

626
02:07:51,609 --> 02:08:05,350
What's wrong with me? He's got his hands on his fucking hips. This is un-fucking-believable.

627
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:31,319
Who cares? This is on. They won't listen to me. They got stuck behind the kiosk in the jewelry

628
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:36,119
store, and they wouldn't come out. Oh, no. The original timeline is happening now.

629
02:08:36,119 --> 02:08:49,560
They would have had full health. I don't care. Fucking idiots couldn't figure out how to walk

630
02:08:49,560 --> 02:09:01,479
over a jewelry counter. Should have just left you. You're supposed to drink the orange juice, Bart.

631
02:09:02,199 --> 02:09:26,630
Okay. Where's the bathroom? Save point is behind me. I think we just have to get through this.

632
02:09:34,899 --> 02:09:40,020
Reload? What, for somebody else to get stuck in a store and then two people die or one person dies?

633
02:09:44,970 --> 02:09:50,579
Sir, if you could just kindly come with this whole thing. I'm not doing another reset.

634
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:59,289
Until you can guarantee me. There we go. Here we are. Done. Temporary agreement. Let's talk.

635
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:03,399
I'm at entrance plaza. Yes, I am. We're safe for now.

636
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:12,340
Take what you need from the clothing store. You got it. All right. Here, Bert. Give me that.

637
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:19,590
Drink that. Give me this cooking oil. Okay, whatever. I don't know why my brain is like

638
02:10:19,590 --> 02:10:31,189
this. I thought that said one of seven killed in the corner. Okay, I am going to go and get

639
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:38,489
some fresh clothing. What is that? We have to go. We have to walk all the way around.

640
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:47,140
Save the game. But I don't even know what the save point is. I have to just go there.

641
02:10:47,779 --> 02:11:02,119
Just follow Brad. He doesn't know. If only there was a map. Yeah, but the save points are like,

642
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:12,939
here, look. Okay. So if I go up, I guess I could, I have to go this way. So no, I am going this way.

643
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:26,460
I can save. I'm saving the game. I can't even go this way. I'm going to piss my pants. Speaking

644
02:11:26,460 --> 02:11:35,449
of pissing. No, I, I, everyone was like, you got it. You have to just do the thing. You have

645
02:11:35,449 --> 02:11:51,399
to go the right to go this way. Go to the running guy icon on the map. What the fuck does that do?

646
02:11:51,399 --> 02:12:03,189
There's a safe point right here. Otto. Otto's in here with me. I don't have that. Why are

647
02:12:03,189 --> 02:12:17,819
you guys giving me bogus info? Okay. Where's the safe point? It's right here. All right.

648
02:12:17,819 --> 02:12:29,260
It's just flexing. Make it to flexing. Let's go. Move it. Did you just trip?

649
02:12:33,659 --> 02:12:39,770
No, you know what, Aaron? You come over here. Give me that bat. You're useless with that thing.

650
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:45,909
My God, you are so useless. Just go ahead and stand there.

651
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:55,210
Bat. These guys are so bad. Give me your bat. Give me the bat. You take the cooking oil.

652
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:02,550
Take your, take the cooking oil. I don't care what you do with it. Just fuck off.

653
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:38,710
All right. Where's flexing? Almost level six. All right. Flexing. Time to save the game.

654
02:13:47,560 --> 02:13:53,420
Guys, are they dead? No, they're standing around in circles, bumping into stuff. Look at,

655
02:13:53,420 --> 02:14:09,449
look at their icons. Just in case. All right. Where you guys at?

656
02:14:09,449 --> 02:14:47,289
What are you guys doing? What is he holding? There's only so much I can do.

657
02:14:48,170 --> 02:15:02,579
You guys are just walking into stuff. Like, do these guys just die? Like, why are they,

658
02:15:02,579 --> 02:15:18,060
why is this so difficult? Oh, fuck the both of you. What is going on right now?

659
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:26,869
Frank, I need help over here. Frank. Frank. Oh, I'm just walking into walls. Frank. Frank.

660
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:34,710
Frank, help me. Fuck you, Bert. A waste of time.

661
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:58,739
Damn it, man. It doesn't even make any fucking sense. Well, I, now I have no one. Before I had

662
02:15:58,739 --> 02:16:16,010
Leah. What is it? Frank, you're on the food court. Yeah. Okay. Try mixing different food in the

663
02:16:16,010 --> 02:16:30,630
blenders. What are you talking about? Mix the food in the blenders? I mean, this is still,

664
02:16:30,630 --> 02:16:47,989
where's the blender? Actually, a lot of wine here. Microwave? Oh, I can't even cook food? This is

665
02:16:47,989 --> 02:17:01,100
strange. Okay. I don't see a blender on the other side. I can't believe everybody's dead.

666
02:17:07,059 --> 02:17:21,190
Corn. Zucchini. Okay. Any blenders? Another store, maybe? I'll check another store.

667
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:32,729
Taco shop right here. I mean, a coffee shop would have a blender, wouldn't it?

668
02:17:35,219 --> 02:17:44,969
Oh, is it a blender? Okay. Um, examine. Juice power. Insert two food items into a mixer and

669
02:17:44,969 --> 02:17:49,610
you can create your own original juice concoction. Different color juices possess different properties

670
02:17:49,610 --> 02:18:04,809
and effects. So, um, I need to get different juice. What just came up? Juice. Quick step. What?

671
02:18:07,159 --> 02:18:30,840
Hold on. I'm cooking oil and wine. Pick it up. All right. So is this just temporary? This is just

672
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:39,659
temporary thing, right? That's cool. I'll figure out some stuff to do later. Mixed drinks will

673
02:18:39,659 --> 02:18:51,049
fully heal you. Okay. That's cool. That's super useful. Um, I'll have to figure that out later

674
02:18:51,049 --> 02:18:58,790
when I have more health. Put corn in there. Oh, wait. What's this? Yogurt. Okay. Yogurt.

675
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:18,920
Yogurt and ice pops. What'd I get? A quick step. Cool. Entire box. All right. I have, I need,

676
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:38,790
okay. What do I have for? All right. I'm good. Get off the counter. All right. I gotta go.

677
02:19:39,430 --> 02:19:44,809
Yeah, this is Frank. Space rider machine and wonderland pizza. Looks like it's out of control.

678
02:19:45,850 --> 02:20:01,559
Maybe there's somebody out there. Go there. I'm just going to let it talk.

679
02:20:02,659 --> 02:20:05,379
It's, I know it's a, I know. Let them talk about the phone.

680
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:24,500
Uh, using the dumbbell as a phone. Use the quick step. All right. I'll save Sophie. Maybe not.

681
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:31,979
Should I do the quick step? What does it do? I'm gonna see what it does. Holy shit. That's

682
02:20:31,979 --> 02:20:44,780
unbelievable. Oh my God. This is the best thing ever. Sophie, come here. Let's go. Come here.

683
02:20:45,819 --> 02:20:58,420
Can you run as fast as me? Take one. What? Oh, do I go faster? I can't just take holder and just

684
02:20:58,420 --> 02:21:06,100
drag and run. No, go this way. They're in the, they're in the thing where they're driving to.

685
02:21:06,659 --> 02:21:26,360
Can they shoot that far? All right. Ladies and gentlemen, we have made it to the portion where

686
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:52,629
I've had to rewind to now. All right. We're good. This way. People dance. This is kind of a people

687
02:21:52,629 --> 02:22:12,760
dance, isn't it? Just open the door. All right. Let's go. Come here. All right. Where's the save?

688
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:32,920
Save point is to the left and down the hall. Do I even have any weapons? Pretty good dodges.

689
02:22:51,579 --> 02:23:19,750
I don't have any fucking items. Oh, yes, I do. Come here. Um, just go to the whatever. I need

690
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:30,200
to close. Anything in the urinals? Come here. I don't even need to hold your hand. Why am I

691
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:56,760
doing that? Okay. We're good. Fucking itchy eyeball. Nice push. I have no weapons at all.

692
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:07,799
Bad. Give me that back. Let's go. All right. Now I got to go to the save, the safe zone,

693
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:18,950
which is hold her hand. She's hilarious. She'll be fine. All right. Safe zone is down this way.

694
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:37,020
Okay. I think that's just where we're going. Let's go. Nice hit. Wash my hands. There's no time for

695
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:44,250
that. I'm sorry, guys. But in a scenario like this, you're going to wash your hands.

696
02:24:46,229 --> 02:24:49,909
You're not going to go to the bathroom to pee. You're just going to go over there and just piss

697
02:24:49,909 --> 02:25:03,190
all over the wall as fast as you possibly can. You're still going to use the bathroom. Good.

698
02:25:03,190 --> 02:25:17,829
All right. This way. All right. There's the exit. Let's go. Damn. Not washing hands is exactly how

699
02:25:17,829 --> 02:25:23,799
a zombie apocalypse starts. But if it's already happening, then there's no it's already over.

700
02:25:24,600 --> 02:26:07,110
Oh shit. Got it. You killed them. Whoa. What a plot is developing right in front of us.

701
02:26:07,909 --> 02:26:13,690
There's a zombie playing host to a queen parasite in every large gathering of zombies.

702
02:26:13,690 --> 02:26:19,290
Defeat that zombie and get your hands on the queen to use it as an item. Queen infected zombie.

703
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:26,420
Capture the queen. So they're the ones with the red eyes. Found a couple of survivors in the

704
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:31,829
bookstore in Wonderland Plaza. What was that thing? They looked Japanese. Probably tourists.

705
02:26:31,829 --> 02:26:54,379
Okay. All right. Let's go. Follow me. I brought somebody. I got a survivor. Oh, queen. Get out

706
02:26:54,379 --> 02:27:11,340
of the way. This guy just puked in my mouth. Hold on. I want to get a good one of that. Turn

707
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:34,579
around and do a big shove and action. Turn around and shove the zombie. Go for it. She just pushed

708
02:27:34,579 --> 02:28:05,659
me. Every time I put the camera down. Give me the queen. Let's go. I'm taking this. All right. I have

709
02:28:05,659 --> 02:28:19,750
somebody to deliver. Oops. Do I get money if it's a fake person? What if it's just a mannequin?

710
02:28:21,299 --> 02:28:31,450
And then I can save the game. There we are. Let's go. Sophie Richards. I can't believe those maniacs

711
02:28:31,450 --> 02:28:36,940
killed him. I never got a chance to tell how I feel. Very good. Escort complete. Level seven

712
02:28:36,940 --> 02:28:47,739
reached. 24,000 pp. Extra life cube. Nice. All right. This is the next part of the game.

713
02:28:53,139 --> 02:28:59,829
So that's what Dr. Barnaby said, huh? The old coot's not dumb. He wants us to call for help first.

714
02:29:00,469 --> 02:29:12,940
We got to line out or what? The signal's being blocked. I can't even contact HQ on the emergency

715
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:17,579
line. Still in the same costume. I was right. We want to get our hands on Dr. Barnaby. We're

716
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:23,129
gonna have to secure a way out of here ourselves. All right. We've got to deal with the situation

717
02:29:23,129 --> 02:29:27,290
we've been handed. The boneheads back at HQ might be working on something, too.

718
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:34,889
There's a thing to save every single person, right? Can you imagine how annoying that would be?

719
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:45,139
At noon, it's my ride. Is your ride reliable? Absolutely. That's how I plan on getting out

720
02:29:45,139 --> 02:29:52,819
of here. All right, then. I'll see to it that the DHS picks up the charter fee. Can we take Dr.

721
02:29:52,819 --> 02:30:00,100
Barnaby as well? Sure. As long as you tell me what's going on. Okay. I'll tell you what you want to know.

722
02:30:00,979 --> 02:30:07,719
Later. We have more pressing business right now. All right. If we have to wait here for three days,

723
02:30:07,719 --> 02:30:13,959
we'll need supplies. Water, blankets, and the like. We'll get Dr. Barnaby here tomorrow morning.

724
02:30:13,959 --> 02:30:20,540
I want you to keep an eye on the monitors. How much money would it take me to save everybody?

725
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:28,180
It just wouldn't happen. All right. That's the first case completed. The next case will occur

726
02:30:28,180 --> 02:30:36,170
at 6 a.m. Oh, man. What time is it? Okay, so I got some time. All right. I need to save the game,

727
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:52,250
then I have to pee. Oh, it's out the other way. Why is my eye so itchy? I want like a new pair of eyes.

728
02:30:52,889 --> 02:31:07,850
Let's go pee on the wall quick. All right, we're good. Image in the monitor. Oh, right. All right.

729
02:31:07,850 --> 02:35:05,579
I'll be right back. I'm just gonna pee. I'll be a minute, two minutes. See you in a second. All right. Okay.

730
02:35:06,459 --> 02:35:23,420
Crisis averted. Where I was. Okay. All right. So I have some time. Should I go for it? Should I try?

731
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:29,739
No, you can't even do it. What about like food and shit? Don't they leave stuff lying around?

732
02:35:30,860 --> 02:35:42,600
Didn't wash hands? I didn't have time to do that. There's Jeff and Natalie. See, I'm saving people.

733
02:35:43,690 --> 02:35:52,540
I'm not doing terrible. I think I'm good. Yeah, there's nothing else. And this is where just they,

734
02:35:52,540 --> 02:35:58,540
all the survivors go. I get it. I have a queen. I have the drink and I need something

735
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:13,850
that Apple's probably better. It's good. It looks good. Time to go. Wait, image on the monitor,

736
02:36:14,569 --> 02:36:19,670
but the zombies going berserk like this. I don't, the press is going to go in. You know what I'm

737
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:23,590
saying? Sorry to get involved in all this, Frank. You might want to consider spending the night here.

738
02:36:27,190 --> 02:36:37,319
Image in the monitor. Kind of running out of time on this one. Image in the monitor. Where the hell

739
02:36:37,319 --> 02:36:51,579
are you trying to get me to go? Image in the monitor. Can't do it. Okay. Photo to out of

740
02:36:51,579 --> 02:37:08,360
control. All right, Japanese tourists. Let's go. I have time. Otis, stop calling me. Okay, let's go

741
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:33,879
back down. No, no, that's kind of, how can you guys still use the elevator? Kill, kill, kill them,

742
02:37:33,879 --> 02:37:49,670
kill them. I'm trying. How did they all get down here? I saw somebody in the North Plaza. He was

743
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:55,129
leaving the supermarket. Yep. He was in a real panic. Something must be happening. Don't hang

744
02:37:55,129 --> 02:38:21,590
up on me. Oh, just, I'm just Otis. Can you and I, can I just keep the line open? Just keep your

745
02:38:21,590 --> 02:38:33,049
phone turned on. I'll keep my phone turned on. You can just talk to me. Anyways, here's what I was

746
02:38:33,049 --> 02:38:39,270
saying. Go ahead. Say what you need to say. North Plaza, leaving the supermarket, right? He's in a

747
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:54,889
panic. I know. Something's after him. Good. Cool. Is this the shoes? I need, like, I need a new

748
02:38:54,889 --> 02:39:11,719
costume. I can't just have a pair of, like, sneakers. Dermot, you're Otis's only friend.

749
02:39:15,059 --> 02:39:21,620
Well, whatever. I can't be. I got stuff going on. I got stuff to do. I can't just take every one of

750
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:41,110
your phone calls. Eat that. Eat that, bro. Okay, give me the knife. Just tried to stab me. Almost

751
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:57,100
got it too. What's in here? Pant and barrels. New shirts. New anything. I need anything else besides

752
02:39:57,100 --> 02:40:09,129
this t-shirt. No, here we go. Sure. All right. What are we at? Let's see what we got going on here.

753
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:21,719
Uh, there, what's this question mark? What, what's that mean? Question mark. Does that mean the

754
02:40:21,719 --> 02:40:35,450
person's here? Why is there a question mark over here? Book. Engineering. The act of holding a book

755
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:39,129
is enough to activate its properties. Different books have different effects.

756
02:40:40,469 --> 02:40:45,110
PP gain from photography or defeating zombies is increased, and learn skateboarding or cycling

757
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:52,149
tricks or valuable skills that can make the escorting of survivors easier. Some books have

758
02:40:52,149 --> 02:40:55,750
an effect on other items in your possession. Items affected by these books are marked with

759
02:40:56,389 --> 02:41:03,139
a book icon. Restored power of food consumption is boosted with a heal plus. Multiple books can

760
02:41:03,139 --> 02:41:08,090
be held in tandem to further increase the bonus. Items covered in a book's contents

761
02:41:08,090 --> 02:41:15,110
experience an appreciable increase to the durability. Okay, so what? Engineering.

762
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:46,549
Engineering? What's the plus? Press X on the book. Hold on. Item plus. Hold on to tools and

763
02:41:46,549 --> 02:41:52,469
construction related items. Three, three times as long. Okay, so tools and construction items.

764
02:41:53,190 --> 02:42:03,860
What is that? What counts as a construction item? Wood. Is a knife, knife, a tool. Oh, great. These

765
02:42:03,860 --> 02:42:33,270
guys again. Quick step. Not a bad idea. It's actually kind of to the beat of the song.

766
02:42:33,270 --> 02:43:01,059
Holy shit. They came out of nowhere. No. Oh my god. Bad. Bad. Bad. Oh.

767
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:16,620
Fuck. Oh, that hurts. That hurts. No, come on. This is bullshit. This is actual bullshit.

768
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:39,000
Get it. Thank god. All right, get rid of the uh, get rid of the bat. I want more health.

769
02:43:39,719 --> 02:44:00,340
This is a tool, right? Okay, where are these tourists? This way. They'll be marked with a

770
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:20,790
purple book icon. Oh, that's cool. Hitbox. Okay, we're looking for the tour. Frank, you're in

771
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:28,299
Wonderland Plaza. The most popular attraction is the space rider roller coaster. The I can't move.

772
02:44:28,299 --> 02:44:50,200
I can't move. I can't move. I can't move. All right, who made the roller coaster tycoon ride

773
02:44:51,290 --> 02:45:05,750
where you can't get off of it? Is somebody on it? That's really fast. All right, where are the

774
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:22,170
tourists? Well, I need to get something from here. Run like the wind. Shoe store. Just a hat.

775
02:45:22,170 --> 02:45:39,799
What about new sneakers? Yeah, sure. I need a lot of shoe stores. I gotta get this shirt off.

776
02:45:39,799 --> 02:45:48,149
I've had the same shirt on the whole game. This is a default clothing. Bowling balls. I can't pick

777
02:45:48,149 --> 02:45:58,780
up the bowling balls. All right, sporting goods. Hanger. Worthless. Tennis racket. No. All right.

778
02:45:58,780 --> 02:46:18,219
Here we go. Right. Skateboard. Oh, a skateboard. I can use it. How do I use it? Okay, you just use

779
02:46:18,219 --> 02:46:40,340
the skateboard. This is awesome. That's all I can do. All right. Tourists. Here comes another one.

780
02:46:42,889 --> 02:46:51,930
Hello? Can you get... Hey, hey, easy. Talk? How do we... Can I talk? Oh, wait, what's this book?

781
02:46:52,569 --> 02:47:03,260
What does this one do? Learn to speak rudimentary Japanese. Hey, I can... Listen. Wait. I'm different.

782
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:14,729
Not one of them. Who are you? Frank, photograph taker, journalist. Are you go safe? What? Oh,

783
02:47:14,729 --> 02:47:26,340
shit. Hold on. How do I just attack without drinking? Can I use the ball? I need something to throw.

784
02:47:26,340 --> 02:47:34,579
I need something. Anything. This... Just apples. What is this? What does this do? Hold on to edged

785
02:47:34,579 --> 02:47:44,250
weapons three times as long. I need the Japanese one. All right. Give me the register. No, not this.

786
02:47:44,250 --> 02:47:54,870
Give me the register. Somebody's... He's gonna die. One zombie is gonna kill this guy. Move.

787
02:48:04,329 --> 02:48:16,979
Move. Think seriously first, friend. What kind of journalist would come here for a story? There's

788
02:48:16,979 --> 02:48:21,780
clearly something wrong with this man. Wait. I know Japanese. She'll hear you. I can... I know

789
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:27,059
Japanese. Don't worry. His Japanese sucks. He won't understand. We can't very well stay here by

790
02:48:27,059 --> 02:48:33,340
ourselves, can we? Let's just follow him for now but remain suspicious of his tricks. This is all

791
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:38,549
your fault. Of all the places to vacation, why were you so keen on this dump? What? The other

792
02:48:38,549 --> 02:48:47,639
one who said it would be a good time. Anybody want a drink? Anyone there? So you're gonna follow?

793
02:48:48,360 --> 02:48:55,450
Okay. What's this? What is this book? Skateboarding. Okay. I got a skateboarding book.

794
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:19,399
You coming? I need the Japanese book, don't I? Where is it? I have it already? No, I don't.

795
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:31,819
Skateboard. Is it... What's the... Talk more than once? I don't have an option to because I don't

796
02:49:31,819 --> 02:49:42,100
have the Japanese book on me anymore. I can't talk. Where the hell is the Japanese book? There it is.

797
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:51,719
Okay. Come here. There we go. Come. No. Come. Decide quickly, please.

798
02:49:52,680 --> 02:50:05,000
Fantastic. Pardon our rudeness. Here she'll go. Got it. All right. They both joined. I don't have

799
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:20,459
any weapons though. I got a new skill. Kick back skill. That's so easy to do that. To just

800
02:50:20,459 --> 02:50:33,540
accidentally drink the fucking thing. Health book. That guy's almost dead. Here, take some snacks.

801
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:46,870
How many sloths do you guys have? Come here. Drunk skateboarder. All right. You guys are good?

802
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:55,989
I need to get rid of this. Like, seriously. You know, I know what this does. By the way,

803
02:50:56,870 --> 02:51:01,059
I've been watching somebody play this like 10 years ago and I know what this does. It's like

804
02:51:01,059 --> 02:51:12,100
a grenade. All right. I gotta bring... Let's see. What time is it? 1 30. I have to 6 to do... I can

805
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:19,299
only do... What do I have here? Image in the monitor. We're gonna go back. I'm gonna take

806
02:51:19,299 --> 02:51:31,139
him back. It's time to save. Save. Yeah. Save the game. Anywhere I can do this. Where's the nearest

807
02:51:31,139 --> 02:51:40,620
save point? I have to go down and then behind. It's downstairs and then around. Oh, let's faster.

808
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:50,920
This way or that way? Probably this way. Learning Jap. Wait. There's a gun. Wait.

809
02:51:50,920 --> 02:52:02,069
Wait. I probably need to talk to him again. The one thing that's actually kind of hard for me

810
02:52:02,069 --> 02:52:07,829
to get used to is how left trigger is not aim gun. Left trigger is aim camera. Right trigger is aim

811
02:52:07,829 --> 02:52:28,299
gun. What the fuck did I just do? Good. All right. Are you guys still... Seriously?

812
02:52:31,750 --> 02:52:40,860
Coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Y'all just stare at him. Let's go.

813
02:52:41,100 --> 02:52:56,489
Come on. Give him a gun. Come on. You can make it. I know you can. Weapons. We can't use like shoes

814
02:52:56,489 --> 02:53:02,120
for weapons. How many shoe stores does this mall have? Like half of the stores are shoe stores.

815
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:42,329
Come here. No? Nothing? Here. You take the gun. You do it. He's got a knife. Give me the knife.

816
02:53:42,329 --> 02:54:06,139
Let's go. Player in a path. Here. You take this knife. Whatever. Just take... You guys. Anybody

817
02:54:06,139 --> 02:54:17,530
take a knife. Let's go. All right. Where's that save point? 200 zombies killed. PP bonus. Nice.

818
02:54:18,889 --> 02:54:34,790
He just shot me in the head. Thanks. Okay. Let's see. Where am I going here? Food court. And then

819
02:54:34,790 --> 02:54:44,680
there's the save point. And then I have to get back over here. So I can't... Okay. Roller coaster.

820
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:51,290
Roller coaster. I gotta save these two. They'll still be on the ride. Don't worry. Look at my

821
02:54:51,290 --> 02:55:00,469
watch. Out of control. There's still plenty of time. Where the roller coaster is a shortcut.

822
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:10,540
Well, I'm already almost there. Like I'm going to the save point over here. Crazy. This way,

823
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:26,940
right? Yes. This way to the right and the save point's right there. Here, right? You'll get

824
02:55:26,940 --> 02:55:30,620
grabbed really easily by these people. Just cover yourself in fucking butter. You'll be fine.

825
02:55:31,579 --> 02:55:41,079
Are they all right? I give you a gun and a knife and you guys can't even handle yourselves?

826
02:55:41,719 --> 02:56:10,100
Let's go. Now, where are we at? To the right. Not this way. This way. I just want to save it.

827
02:56:18,040 --> 02:56:33,860
Come on. Thank you. Shoot me again. I have no health. This is horrible. I need to go. I need

828
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:56,309
to go to a restaurant or something. The gym is right here. All right. Cool. I'm going to get

829
02:56:56,309 --> 02:57:03,670
this. You know what? Fuck it. I think I know what this does. Let's do it. That is what it does. I

830
02:57:03,670 --> 02:57:19,850
knew it. Now I have to. I'm dead. I'm dead. I gotta go back. I went the wrong way. I'm dead.

831
02:57:19,850 --> 02:58:02,760
Goodbye. Wasted the bees. I don't care. You guys not make it through. You guys are fucking useless.

832
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:23,879
You gotta let everybody die. Who cares? Is this even the right one? They just stand there and let

833
02:58:23,879 --> 02:58:33,930
the zombies hit them. Look at all this extra work I have to do. I have like a case to solve.

834
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:49,379
They're not going to get out of this. You know, the amount of times that you've cupped your hand

835
02:58:49,379 --> 02:59:08,920
to say, help me. You could have shot the gun five times. You guys have weapons. Use them.

836
02:59:11,459 --> 02:59:33,020
Let's go. Go, go, go, go. Over here. Are you close enough? Holy sheep shit. I'm dead.

837
02:59:35,159 --> 02:59:46,950
Why? What happened to my watch? Why is nothing selected? I have to clear a path for them to

838
02:59:46,950 --> 03:00:03,899
walk in a straight line. Oh, fuck the both of you. Come on. Here. I want you to have a drink.

839
03:00:04,860 --> 03:00:10,379
I'm certain I would do better in a zombie apocalypse than everybody in this game.

840
03:00:11,420 --> 03:00:24,819
Like one thousand percent. A million percent positive. Who cares? I don't even want you to

841
03:00:24,819 --> 03:00:49,579
have a weapon. Okay, let's go. You definitely wouldn't. You have no geography physics intuition

842
03:00:49,579 --> 03:00:55,819
whatsoever. Are you actually saying that in a video game when I'm walking around a mall

843
03:00:55,819 --> 03:00:59,819
that I don't know how to like drive my car around the city that I live in?

844
03:00:59,819 --> 03:01:18,100
What? Wait, where the fuck are we going right now? What is going on? Oh, it's out this way.

845
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:26,920
All right. I've got stuff like fucking fighting chat. I'm dead. Yeah, guys, during the zombie

846
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:32,040
apocalypse, I'm just going to get up and sprint as fast as I can and ram my body into the wall

847
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:36,600
and knock myself unconscious and die. That's what's going to happen. We'll let that be the

848
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:53,239
cannon. I'm so sick of babysitting these two. I'm multi-boxing on three accounts right now.

849
03:02:00,659 --> 03:02:20,840
My fucking god. What are you letting him do this for? Jesus Christ. Just run and call them.

850
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:47,909
That's what I was doing. No, not you. The guy. We're dead. We're fucking dead. Are you serious?

851
03:02:47,909 --> 03:02:55,780
I have to go through the. Oh, we're dead. We're dead. There's no way. Just run. Go. Go. Stop

852
03:02:55,780 --> 03:03:02,729
running into walls. You fucking. Holy shit. There's no way I'm going to make this back.

853
03:03:03,610 --> 03:03:07,850
There's no way. Not a chance at hell. They're both dead. What a waste of time this was.

854
03:03:11,899 --> 03:03:22,260
God, Jesus Christ. You gotta be kidding me. I need a shortcut. How do I log a short.

855
03:03:37,319 --> 03:03:55,059
Oh, my God. How the hell am I going to do this with these two? Do the roller coaster shortcut?

856
03:03:58,540 --> 03:04:31,620
God. So you're saying go back to the. I don't think this is humanly possible to get these guys

857
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:36,950
across with what I have right now. Go to the gun store and get a gun. So I have to leave these

858
03:04:36,950 --> 03:04:47,899
guys to die because they just stand around and die. Use the V. Everyone got mad at me when I

859
03:04:47,899 --> 03:05:04,729
used it last time. I'm going to use it. Well, he's dead. He's killing me so I can redo this.

860
03:05:06,739 --> 03:05:28,569
Oh, my God. It's such a mess. Help. Help me. Hey, you're still alive over there.

861
03:05:28,569 --> 03:05:31,530
Crossing the gym is Home Depot. All right, I'm going to go to Home Depot.

862
03:05:37,590 --> 03:05:50,329
Come this way. Get in here. Both of you. Go here. Take one of these. I can't get this to you.

863
03:05:50,329 --> 03:05:59,319
It's already broken. All right, that's why this way. This way. This way. This way. This way. This

864
03:05:59,319 --> 03:06:08,090
way. This way. My God, we're fucked. OK, I need to have weapons here. I've got skill up for this.

865
03:06:15,989 --> 03:06:31,610
I dropped it. Everything I have is fucking broken. OK, I need to fill up on shit. What

866
03:06:31,610 --> 03:06:40,389
do we have here? Toolbox, propane, two by four. I really, really need health.

867
03:06:44,979 --> 03:06:56,440
God knows what the hell that is. All right. At least it's not a total shit show right now.

868
03:06:57,399 --> 03:07:11,930
All right, what else do we got? Anywhere else? All right, we need to go.

869
03:07:12,729 --> 03:07:20,979
Let me look at the map. So there's a save point here. Everyone keeps telling me to go to the guy

870
03:07:20,979 --> 03:07:27,370
that's running. Go to the instant message logo. Aim logo. OK, I'll do it.

871
03:07:28,579 --> 03:07:31,379
It's like every time I look over here, everyone's yelling at me to do this.

872
03:07:32,020 --> 03:07:40,149
All right, here. You take this. How many are there anymore? Two by fours.

873
03:07:43,690 --> 03:07:53,340
Yeah, like lead pipe. Good lead pipe. Plenty of weapons here. You don't even knife. Here,

874
03:07:53,340 --> 03:08:10,120
take the lead pipe. It's much better. What else is in here? No, I don't want that. Sledgehammer.

875
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:23,319
There's a sledgehammer. Brake. Shovel. There's nothing. Oh, here it is. OK. OK, you ready?

876
03:08:30,409 --> 03:08:54,139
Let's go to the instant message logo. Bang a left and then bang a right. I need health to die.

877
03:08:55,979 --> 03:09:05,819
Fuck. God damn it. But the gun keeps shooting me. He shot me like five times.

878
03:09:22,250 --> 03:09:46,709
There are so many motherfuckers down here. There's so many people here. What? Don't even give me this

879
03:09:47,350 --> 03:10:18,010
bullshit trouble. OK, I have to go heal. Oh, boy, I'm in trouble. I don't remember this game being

880
03:10:18,010 --> 03:10:29,899
this difficult. Oh, please. Did they increase the amount of enemies on the screen in like the PC

881
03:10:29,899 --> 03:10:41,670
version? Maybe it's because I was throwing CDs at people. Well, they're just dead. There is no

882
03:10:41,670 --> 03:10:59,959
physical way I can save those people. Impossible. No way I could do that right there. Holy shit.

883
03:11:03,379 --> 03:11:11,209
Oh, I'm dead. So what have we learned? We've learned that this was a mistake to come this way,

884
03:11:11,209 --> 03:11:15,930
and I'm going to go the other way and go to the roller coaster. That's my only option at the

885
03:11:15,930 --> 03:11:34,069
moment. I don't even care if these guys die. I'm going to go get a weapon. Good luck. Good luck,

886
03:11:34,069 --> 03:11:44,120
you two. I think I'm wasting too much time trying to take care of every single person I come across

887
03:11:44,200 --> 03:12:02,489
when no fucking way. They just die. Who cares? Good luck. I wish you the best.

888
03:12:03,370 --> 03:12:12,500
I kind of want the gun back though. Give me the gun. Here, you can have this.

889
03:12:14,360 --> 03:12:48,659
No, where's the gun? Give me the gun. Give me the gun. I'm going to get healed. Holy shit.

890
03:12:52,309 --> 03:13:01,930
I'm not going to shoot this guy. I'm going to. I could have healed the other guy too. Is he dead?

891
03:13:09,850 --> 03:13:14,489
Well, the other guy was just standing and letting the zombies fucking punch him in the face.

892
03:13:14,489 --> 03:13:21,479
That's been what the survivors do this whole game. This please hurt me.

893
03:13:23,719 --> 03:14:20,979
Take him more. Let's go. You can do it. Wait. Good. Did he not make it? You gotta be fucking

894
03:14:20,979 --> 03:14:53,100
kidding me. I don't care. I'm not going to need that book anymore. Okay, here we go. Hey,

895
03:14:53,100 --> 03:15:30,299
I'm at the roller coaster. What's here? Rover? This is a shortcut on the roller coaster. I just

896
03:15:30,299 --> 03:15:34,299
want to make sure we understand. That's what everyone told me to do. I'm never listening to

897
03:15:34,299 --> 03:16:03,930
the chat ever again. Do I have to fight this guy? I don't. Jesus.

898
03:16:25,739 --> 03:16:30,549
I have to kill this guy. Whoa. I'm going to get. Okay, run him over. Run him over with the car.

899
03:16:30,549 --> 03:16:33,590
Run him over with the car. Got him. Already figured it out. I already know what to do. I win.

900
03:16:34,549 --> 03:17:04,979
What? I did it. Technically. Oh, shit. I'm all the way back here. Not good. Not good.

901
03:17:05,940 --> 03:17:11,399
This is not good. Oh, boy. This is going to be fun.

902
03:17:15,299 --> 03:17:21,860
With me, with me, with me. Both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both, both,

903
03:17:21,860 --> 03:17:33,239
both, both. Fuck the hardware store. Don't read the book. Nice shot. All right. I can keep you

904
03:17:33,319 --> 03:17:46,469
guys both around. Will they help me during this? Okay. Both of you. Come on. We got some drinking

905
03:17:46,469 --> 03:18:00,549
to do. Heals. Come here. Take this. Give me the gun. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.

906
03:18:00,549 --> 03:18:15,930
I'll take care of it. You idiot. Here. Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. You can do it.

907
03:18:16,569 --> 03:18:24,219
Here you are. All you have to do is walk up the stairs. It's really easy. Just walk up the stairs.

908
03:18:25,020 --> 03:18:36,379
You guys are just bait. Just drink the wine. Okay. Give me the knife. I need,

909
03:18:37,500 --> 03:19:09,430
um, I need to bring a hit. No, you die in one hit anyways from the clown. Here we go. Let's go.

910
03:19:09,430 --> 03:19:27,540
Nothing in the way. All right. Stay with me. This time. Don't get lost. Go on. Good. Go on. Good.

911
03:19:27,540 --> 03:19:32,340
Okay. Here we go. I need to get prepared for this though. Is there anything else down here?

912
03:19:32,340 --> 03:19:34,020
There's probably something I can take. Like a bigger, better,

913
03:19:35,860 --> 03:19:59,500
gotta be like a better weapon down here. This is, this died my hair. Okay. I'm looking for

914
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:07,299
something strong. It's a prop. It's not, is that two? No, it's not tuber here.

915
03:20:08,020 --> 03:20:24,149
Just cause you said that I have to change it back. Something else. All right. So how am I

916
03:20:24,149 --> 03:20:33,139
going to kill this guy? Save the game. Is there a safe spot down here? There is. Okay. Down all the

917
03:20:33,139 --> 03:20:53,899
way down here. We're going to save it. Trade that knife out. So good. Let's get the game saved.

918
03:21:06,229 --> 03:21:27,059
Good. Finally, you guys have a shred of intelligence. This can't open the maintenance

919
03:21:27,059 --> 03:21:36,540
key to open these. Fuck. Okay. Let's keep going and save the game. I'm in a much better position

920
03:21:36,540 --> 03:21:59,860
with this health though. Just take it slow. No reason to go fast. You're going to die in two hits.

921
03:21:59,940 --> 03:22:02,420
Yeah, I know. At least I'm going to die in two hits and not one.

922
03:22:06,819 --> 03:22:26,600
What? Oh, good. Swimming through this guy. So now the game is saved. Is it worth it? Should I?

923
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:38,569
Okay. I'm going up there. You can be the one that shoots. I'm just going to trail them around. Okay.

924
03:22:38,569 --> 03:23:04,500
Here we go. Throw some jewels at them. I think that's a great idea. Good. All right. Handgun.

925
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:19,879
Handgun. Handgun. Handgun. Okay. Cool. All right. All right. All right. Here we go. Wait.

926
03:23:19,879 --> 03:23:25,450
Everybody take a handgun. Take one. We're going to do this together. Look, if we light him up,

927
03:23:25,450 --> 03:23:33,690
he can't do anything. If we fire three guns at him at the same time, he's dead. Don't aim at me.

928
03:23:35,340 --> 03:23:46,620
Okay. You ready? Three guns. I don't care if you miss. You're at least a distraction.

929
03:23:48,219 --> 03:24:01,420
So where am I? I just have to run back here. I'm going to light them up. Good. This way.

930
03:24:04,940 --> 03:24:11,770
I want you guys right here. In here with me. So you can make sure. Here we go. Let's do it.

931
03:24:11,770 --> 03:24:33,540
Here we go. Shoot him. He's blocking. He's blocking everything. Wait. Is he coming?

932
03:24:36,340 --> 03:24:50,739
Shoot him. You can't shoot him. What's that? Oh, whoa. Whoa. What is that? What's that? What is

933
03:24:50,739 --> 03:25:04,790
that? Oh, I stunned him. What happened? Did you shoot the balloon? Follow me. Follow me. Follow

934
03:25:04,790 --> 03:25:17,860
me. Follow me. Follow me. Shoot the balloon. Oh, no. Shinji. Shoot the balloon. Shinji,

935
03:25:17,860 --> 03:25:37,739
don't you have a gun? Shinji, shoot something. Oh, sorry. Light him up. Give me your gun.

936
03:25:39,899 --> 03:25:45,940
Oh, balloon. Follow, follow. Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

937
03:25:46,739 --> 03:26:02,069
Balloon. Shoot him. Run. This way. No. Get out of the way. Kill him. Quick.

938
03:26:04,629 --> 03:26:24,739
Somebody hit him. He was going in with the dumbbell for the last hit. I freaked out. At

939
03:26:24,739 --> 03:26:36,520
least I got him. That was horrible. Hardest boss in the game. Psychopath defeated. Guys,

940
03:26:37,559 --> 03:26:51,459
no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't run away. Small chainsaw. You obtained the ID card. Okay.

941
03:26:53,129 --> 03:27:17,719
Excellent work. You two were worth saving and let's go home. Get on the ride. No, who's this?

942
03:27:19,399 --> 03:27:36,780
He just looks over and goes. Greg, any other survivors around? Yes, there are. The three of

943
03:27:36,780 --> 03:27:43,670
us. I'm sure everyone's in the security room. It's safe there. We got to go. Security room? I know

944
03:27:43,670 --> 03:27:51,799
a shortcut there. Where is it then? Greg, I'd love for you to show us. Small, how many small

945
03:27:51,799 --> 03:28:18,010
chainsaws can I have? This way. Come on. Which way? I was ahead of you. Holy shit, this weapon is

946
03:28:18,010 --> 03:28:41,770
incredible. Wait, I couldn't do a PP there. This is so much better. Imagine playing the game with

947
03:28:41,770 --> 03:29:07,989
anything but this. Wait, there's some sass there. Hold on. Come on. Will this instantly kill Greg?

948
03:29:09,819 --> 03:29:15,180
I'm so scared to accidentally kill somebody. I will instantly kill somebody if I hit them.

949
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:29,209
Don't walk into me, please. This way. I got four of you. Shinji, let's go. This thing's gonna break.

950
03:29:32,010 --> 03:29:53,620
It's gonna break. Do we have another one? Yeah, but should I save it? You guys good? Shinji. Uh-oh.

951
03:29:54,579 --> 03:30:26,090
Shinji. Shinji. Let's go. They respawned. Oh, fuck. All right. Get. Come on, you guys. Made it.

952
03:30:27,719 --> 03:30:32,409
Everybody? Do I have everybody? Just head through here and we're already at Paradise Plaza. Nice

953
03:30:32,409 --> 03:30:57,290
shortcut, huh? What do you mean head through here? Oh, oh shit. Okay. Bathroom. Okay. Let's

954
03:30:57,850 --> 03:31:12,059
go. How we doing? Image in the monitor. We're almost there, right? Now we down here. Bang it

955
03:31:12,059 --> 03:31:37,370
left. Let's go. You guys aren't all stuck in the hallway, are you? One at a time. Okay, it's fine.

956
03:31:38,010 --> 03:31:58,180
I got him with the end. No, somebody's caught. Who is it? Shinji again. Shinji. You're killing me,

957
03:31:58,180 --> 03:32:12,250
Shinji. You're killing me with this bullshit. It's always you. It's always you. Always. Be better.

958
03:32:12,969 --> 03:32:34,100
Okay, now is it up or is it to the... I think it's straight ahead, right? Yeah, it's just this way.

959
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:48,489
Stop running away from your problems. Okay. Just follow the arrow. Yeah, I know, but sometimes it

960
03:32:48,489 --> 03:33:17,930
can be upstairs. Oh my... Stop standing still. Get over here. You idiots. Oh, you're gonna get me

961
03:33:17,930 --> 03:33:40,149
killed. Let's go. Oh shit. Somebody get that. Go get it. I'm not doing this. I'm dead. They need to...

962
03:33:40,149 --> 03:33:55,540
They have to do... They have to take care of it. You guys are useless. Absolutely useless. Don't

963
03:33:55,540 --> 03:34:02,329
shoot me with the gun. In fact, give me the gun. Here, you take the knife. You take the dumbbell.

964
03:34:02,889 --> 03:34:35,899
Give me the gun. All right, I feel much safer now. Go in there. Come on. God, I just... I would move,

965
03:34:35,899 --> 03:34:55,209
but I just don't have any health. Come on. No. We good? I need all of you. What happened to Greg?

966
03:34:55,209 --> 03:35:15,340
Oh, he's not as... Okay. Somebody... Somebody get this guy. Get in there. Get in there. Get in

967
03:35:15,340 --> 03:35:17,899
there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in there. Get in

968
03:35:17,899 --> 03:35:42,680
there. Get in there. Just press the button. Oh my god. That was horrible. Get up here. Nice jump. I

969
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:50,389
got three survivors. I feel good about this. I did it. I'm honored that you helped me. Please accept

970
03:35:50,389 --> 03:36:07,370
my humble gratitude. Got them both. Escort complete. 90,000 pp. Hell yeah. Save. That's what I'm going

971
03:36:07,450 --> 03:36:22,659
for right now. Let's do it. Save game. That was... My whole body just hurt when that elevator opened.

972
03:36:26,229 --> 03:36:33,979
No more puny inventory. Oh, thank god. Okay. Start next mission. Image in the monitor.

973
03:36:34,940 --> 03:36:41,270
The zombies berserk like they tell the professor going anywhere until morning.

974
03:36:42,870 --> 03:36:58,860
Not this one. Might need to spend the night here. Yeah. No, no. Okay. What? Did I just do that

975
03:36:59,340 --> 03:37:01,180
with like 30 seconds remaining?

976
03:37:06,010 --> 03:37:09,639
Holy shit. Okay.

977
03:37:31,370 --> 03:37:34,010
Brad, it's just a screen. That's not really here.

978
03:37:38,440 --> 03:37:53,530
Case two. Yeah. Let's save it. All right. Rescue the professor. Okay. I gotta do this now.

979
03:37:55,180 --> 03:38:00,729
Look at this inventory. I feel so great. Oh my goodness. Look at that. It's so much better.

980
03:38:02,100 --> 03:38:23,340
All right. I gotta do this now. We gotta go. I can't even get rid of the book.

981
03:38:23,899 --> 03:38:29,989
I don't need this, right? Yeah. I can't even throw a book over a fucking fence.

982
03:38:38,229 --> 03:38:45,020
Okay. So let's do this. Rescue the professor. Shadow of the north of the plaza.

983
03:38:45,819 --> 03:38:53,909
Yeah. I bet that shit would happen to me when I first came in here.

984
03:38:55,590 --> 03:39:01,219
It's too late for that. Yeah, there's no one doing that. Oh, there's Otis calling.

985
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:25,940
Sorry, Otis. I'm running around. All right. So I've got photo challenge, wherever that is,

986
03:39:25,940 --> 03:39:31,780
and then now the professor one has to happen now. All right. Fine. Frank, looks like the

987
03:39:31,780 --> 03:39:36,340
shutter leading to the entrance plaza is open now. Maybe the guy dragging the old man around

988
03:39:36,340 --> 03:39:40,260
opened it. Anyway, you can get to the entrance plaza through paradise plaza now. Well, that's

989
03:39:40,260 --> 03:40:15,139
great. Look at that. Uh-oh. Don't be daydreaming out here. Sniper? You're gonna turn into a pair

990
03:40:15,139 --> 03:40:36,790
of pants or you're actually gonna help me this time? Frank, that's not a sniper rifle. Ah, shit.

991
03:40:36,790 --> 03:40:53,350
That's right. Hey, it's the professor. Look out! The professor's gonna end up zombie challenge.

992
03:40:53,350 --> 03:41:01,459
Oh, great. This is gonna be wonderful. I'm going for it. You just worry about staying alive. Got it?

993
03:41:01,459 --> 03:41:21,430
Good. That got chunks on my face. That's disgusting. Action shot. Okay. Stay alive.

994
03:41:22,500 --> 03:41:35,059
I think I can do that. Bag of chips. Uh, okay. I'm just gonna go this way. I'm coming to save you,

995
03:41:35,059 --> 03:41:51,110
Barnaby! Look, I'm blocking his vision. Good strategy. All right, Barnaby. I'm here.

996
03:41:51,670 --> 03:42:19,739
That didn't work. Here! Catch! Actually, I need those. I need those. Can I shoot them?

997
03:42:25,430 --> 03:42:46,520
Sorry. Can I shoot the rope? That was really, really, really bad. Can you get off? Thanks for

998
03:42:46,520 --> 03:43:13,430
the help, dude. Appreciate it. Nice work. Well, I'm dead. Um, it looks like I'm going up. Do I run

999
03:43:13,430 --> 03:43:26,790
faster like this? Imagine turning around as Brad and seeing this. You would have no time to even

1000
03:43:26,790 --> 03:43:32,069
react to this. You'd be like, what? What are you doing? No, stop it, man. What's wrong?

1001
03:43:33,030 --> 03:43:44,440
Holy shit, Brad. Why is he holding, like, a .50 caliber sniper rifle like this? Oh my god.

1002
03:43:44,440 --> 03:44:19,399
That's awful. Brad, just, Brad, just hit some coffee creamer. Brad! So, I need to just go up

1003
03:44:19,399 --> 03:44:34,840
there and kill, I guess. I guess. I don't know. You guys both suck. I ran over to the professor,

1004
03:44:34,840 --> 03:45:04,790
and I thought I had to, like, cut him loose. I might need it later, I don't care. Don't get

1005
03:45:04,790 --> 03:45:23,770
the chainsaws. Oh, lead pipe. Nice. I can't take that call right now. So, where was that shortcut?

1006
03:45:23,770 --> 03:45:29,450
The chainsaws respawn. That's kind of insane. So, is this the shortcut that takes me down

1007
03:45:30,010 --> 03:45:42,459
to here? Where's the red one? Can I now open these? All right, so I'll go there. Like,

1008
03:45:42,459 --> 03:45:58,729
can I do all those now, or do I have to have specific, like, keys to open them? So glad I

1009
03:45:58,729 --> 03:46:13,750
have more space. All right, so then now I go straight this way. This game's fun. All right,

1010
03:46:13,750 --> 03:46:26,760
go ahead and tell me what you want to tell me. All right, listen. Okay. Give me the gun. Oh,

1011
03:46:26,760 --> 03:46:46,729
no gun. Just a night stick. Well, shit. Grab the chainsaw. How am I going to use the chainsaw

1012
03:46:46,729 --> 03:47:10,260
against the guy with the sniper rifle? Don't. I think it's just to the right. It is. It's an

1013
03:47:10,260 --> 03:47:18,469
early 360 game. Of course it's janky. That's all right, though. The game came out, like,

1014
03:47:18,469 --> 03:47:34,729
12, what, 10, 12 years ago? More than that. Like, 14 years ago? Okay. Wonderland. Let's grab the

1015
03:47:34,729 --> 03:47:48,489
chainsaw. He's back this way, right? What was that roller coaster? That's the roller coaster, right?

1016
03:47:55,190 --> 03:48:28,860
Oh, did you guys just bounce off that guy's head? Are there two up here or just one? Oh, actually,

1017
03:48:28,860 --> 03:48:44,120
I'm one of the guys. I wasn't even trying to do that, and he's gonna kill me. A lot of motherfuckers

1018
03:48:44,120 --> 03:49:05,690
over here. Ah, for the love of God. I'm gonna have to use the chainsaw to even get out of here.

1019
03:49:06,409 --> 03:49:17,159
Bingo. All right, now let's go. I can cut through here, can't I? How much fall damage is there in

1020
03:49:17,159 --> 03:49:29,930
the game? A lot? How much is there? Barely any. Okay, now I want some more food.

1021
03:49:31,590 --> 03:49:48,819
That's such bullshit. I need food. I'm going through the food court. Ah, no, this thing sucks. I don't

1022
03:49:48,819 --> 03:50:05,559
want it. Let's get rid of this. All right, chainsaw and knife, and then I want a bunch of food. Okay.

1023
03:50:05,559 --> 03:50:09,479
There's about a two people holed up in one of the shoe stores in Wonderland Plaza. I can't do that

1024
03:50:09,479 --> 03:50:16,579
right now. I'm sorry. Must be a couple looks like something's wrong. Oh, that's not a whole lot of

1025
03:50:16,579 --> 03:50:27,030
time. Let's get three full heels. In fact, just eat this and get a bunch more. Okay, cool. All right,

1026
03:50:27,030 --> 03:50:38,840
I have four full heels, a knife, a gun, and a chainsaw. I'm ready. I got some scoop. Make some

1027
03:50:38,840 --> 03:50:55,670
quick step. Not a bad idea. Why do I keep getting the same ad for Nerf Ultra every single ad?

1028
03:50:55,829 --> 03:51:05,879
They still make Nerf guns? All right, we're gonna do yogurt and popsicle. We'll make like two of them.

1029
03:51:07,079 --> 03:51:19,979
Nerf or nothing? They still been using that same slogan too. Let's do ice pops again and yogurt.

1030
03:51:22,340 --> 03:51:27,479
What about milk? Milk and yogurt? That's like... All right, I'm running out of space here. Okay, I need...

1031
03:51:29,610 --> 03:51:53,510
Okay, I need... Come on. Come on. Just make it so it's not... Recommended. Nectar.

1032
03:51:54,739 --> 03:52:00,680
So sweet and irresistible. Even these can't resist this brew. What is it? Recommended beverage.

1033
03:52:00,680 --> 03:52:12,309
Nectar. All right, whatever the hell that means. I got two quick steps. Let's do wine and milk. Oh,

1034
03:52:12,309 --> 03:52:26,540
that would be disgusting. What is it? Quick step. Try does it only get quick steps and just use all

1035
03:52:26,540 --> 03:52:45,479
my wine. This is a full heel, isn't it? Pink Russian. Quick steps not gonna get you drunk.

1036
03:52:50,600 --> 03:53:07,909
Okay, don't accidentally drink these. All I have is a gun. Let's go. So now I take the shortcut back.

1037
03:53:09,530 --> 03:53:33,899
Wait, I need to save some of these. So bang, I can go up here, right?

1038
03:53:34,620 --> 03:53:57,159
Or should I save it? Save it and then go this way. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, so we've got to save.

1039
03:53:57,159 --> 03:54:05,430
We've got a place to go back up. Oh, I pressed it. I did. I was just holding the gun to my head.

1040
03:54:17,739 --> 03:54:28,729
I am now ready for the boss. Let's go. Go through the exit door, which is over here.

1041
03:54:29,450 --> 03:55:03,370
All right. Check it. Yes, it is. I don't have that. I hear people screaming. Who is screaming

1042
03:55:03,370 --> 03:55:27,180
right now? Here's the entrance plaza. What? This is holy shit. That's for real. I thought you guys

1043
03:55:27,180 --> 03:56:35,110
were fucking with me. There we go. Okay. One, two, fast and oozy. Hacker. Hacker. I just got like

1044
03:56:35,110 --> 03:57:11,030
pre-fired. Fucking shoot me. Just chugging protein shakes. Are you kidding me? I should

1045
03:57:11,030 --> 03:57:37,219
have a chainsaw in my hand. Pick up the sniper. He's unconscious, but alive. Damn. Is he all right?

1046
03:57:37,219 --> 03:57:52,940
Yeah, I'm not in any condition to carry him. You're gonna have to carry me and him. Just go.

1047
03:57:53,659 --> 03:58:15,290
Go to the bike store. I'll get on the pegs. That's not a good way to carry somebody. You

1048
03:58:15,290 --> 03:58:20,389
would pull his arms out of his socket. The sedatives take an effect. Carrying him by

1049
03:58:20,389 --> 03:58:38,600
both of his shoulders. I managed to stop the bleeding, but he's running a fever. He needs

1050
03:58:38,600 --> 03:58:59,739
medicine. A fever. Medicine, huh? Yeah, that's what I said. Case two. Case two, three. Met it. Oh god.

1051
03:58:59,739 --> 03:59:04,379
My mom's out of time. Holy shit. That's no time. No time. No time. No time. No time. I have to go

1052
03:59:04,379 --> 03:59:09,500
now. I need to save it. I'm gonna be all hopped up on protein drinks. Save it and go.

1053
03:59:17,430 --> 03:59:26,549
I would not hold your hand on the trigger and lie down on your chainsaw as a pillow. All right,

1054
03:59:27,350 --> 03:59:42,090
run. I have to hurry up. I'm not gonna drink this yet. Not until I get out there. Medicine, run.

1055
03:59:45,370 --> 04:00:27,989
You fucker. Get out of my way. How many heals? Drink it. No, it slows me down. No, it doesn't.

1056
04:00:35,270 --> 04:01:00,870
Get off the phone. God. Am I out of juice? All right, I think I'm all right. I have to go this way.

1057
04:01:01,430 --> 04:01:33,209
Do I really? I hate these guys. Time until helicopter arrives. Where am I going?

1058
04:01:35,989 --> 04:01:52,600
Frank, we made it to the north plaza. All right, I'm out. Tell me what you want.

1059
04:01:52,600 --> 04:02:03,260
Don't hang up on me. There's a supermarket there along with a gun shop, a cutlery shop, and a home

1060
04:02:03,260 --> 04:02:43,899
center. Every time Otis calls, take a shot. I would not suggest doing that. I need another weapon.

1061
04:02:47,340 --> 04:03:18,469
Fuck. All right, food store. I can heal, right? Just you're in the supermarket. I know.

1062
04:03:20,010 --> 04:03:23,610
You can get to the pharmacy through the door between the butcher counter and the seafood

1063
04:03:23,690 --> 04:03:38,969
counter. I couldn't know. Oh, this is fairly healthy. There's somebody inside the home and

1064
04:03:38,969 --> 04:03:42,809
garden shop in alfresco plaza. I didn't get to look at him, but I'm pretty sure it was a man.

1065
04:03:42,809 --> 04:03:57,940
Okay, he looks scared. Lettuce. Grapefruit. No, I need like apples. I think that heals the most.

1066
04:04:00,200 --> 04:04:07,860
I can make this into a smoothie, couldn't I? Okay, is there a save point?

1067
04:04:10,709 --> 04:04:14,149
There is outside back here. Okay, I'm gonna do that first because I have no idea what's

1068
04:04:14,149 --> 04:04:27,530
going on in here. Lettuce and cooking oil for a smoothie. I mean, what time is it?

1069
04:04:28,329 --> 04:05:04,409
2 15. What time is his end? 2 16. What are you talking about? Are you serious? Did I make it?

1070
04:05:42,659 --> 04:05:48,899
Okay, a person riding in grocery cart. Somebody pushing. We're gonna have to do like bumper cars.

1071
04:06:19,180 --> 04:06:21,100
Scream so loud he disconnected my ex-wife.

1072
04:06:34,739 --> 04:06:44,569
Bitch said when she came to vandalize my store, I don't take kindly to vandalism.

1073
04:06:44,569 --> 04:06:48,780
All right, so just throw a bunch of shit all over the place. Break everything in the store,

1074
04:06:48,780 --> 04:06:53,020
throw everything on the ground, and he'll get stunned. Do I got it right?

1075
04:06:55,659 --> 04:07:05,159
He looked like a puppet. Like somebody had the hand up his back.

1076
04:07:07,899 --> 04:07:37,399
Oh, he has a gun too. He has a gun too. All right, that doesn't work. It might. Holy shit,

1077
04:07:37,399 --> 04:08:06,709
that was. Don't vandalize, right? He hates this. He's in the corner. How do I get him out of the

1078
04:08:06,709 --> 04:08:26,840
corner? Shit. Sneak. Sneak. Snack. Is he going this way? All right, jump across and chainsaw.

1079
04:08:26,840 --> 04:08:34,469
Ready, three, two, one, go. Did I do good or did I do bad? I can't tell.

1080
04:09:10,459 --> 04:09:11,899
This guy's freaking me out.

1081
04:09:24,180 --> 04:09:25,459
Don't shoot yourself in the head.

1082
04:09:45,659 --> 04:10:01,620
I have to get a different clothes. I have the same shitty outfit on. Is my hair a different color?

1083
04:10:02,420 --> 04:10:20,329
One tough cookie. Can you stand? Look, I saw you at the entrance yesterday. You needed medicine too.

1084
04:10:20,329 --> 04:10:26,409
Maybe we should work together. I don't need any help. He's got a pretty sick bugleberry jacket

1085
04:10:26,409 --> 04:10:33,129
though, I would say. You're the one who caused this nightmare. You ruined Santa Cabeza and started

1086
04:10:33,129 --> 04:10:59,559
all this. Oh, a key. Wait, I still have to. I have to hurry up now. Medicine run.

1087
04:11:01,079 --> 04:11:09,190
How do I get in? A key? Use the key. Use the key? How do I get in this? How do I get inside? How do I

1088
04:11:09,190 --> 04:11:28,420
get in the medicine store? How do I get in there? How do I get in there? Come on. Use the pharmacy

1089
04:11:28,420 --> 04:11:44,489
key. First aid kit. I have to bring this back all the way in how much time? What do I need? Where's

1090
04:11:44,489 --> 04:11:58,309
it going? I don't know. Should I go up the stairs? Use the cart. Okay, grab the cart and where am I

1091
04:11:58,309 --> 04:12:10,420
going? Just follow the cart. Okay, I have no time for this shit. I have to go cart and just run.

1092
04:12:11,299 --> 04:12:20,219
You think I can make it? Okay. I didn't mean to do that. I was trying. No, I want to

1093
04:12:21,020 --> 04:12:34,090
I need to put this down. I can't leave with the cart. How do I leave with the cart?

1094
04:12:42,700 --> 04:13:24,889
What? No, don't go over jumps. You idiot. It's not worth spending the time. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1095
04:13:24,889 --> 04:13:47,479
Go. No, no jump. What? What? Do I have to pick this up? Pick it up. Pick the cart up. Wait,

1096
04:13:47,479 --> 04:14:07,129
did I miss this? Did I miss a shortcut? No. I was trying so hard to just get behind it.

1097
04:14:07,850 --> 04:14:18,069
It's over. I'm not going to be able to do it. I pick it up. Stand behind it. Pick it up.

1098
04:14:19,940 --> 04:14:27,100
Fuck. I'm so angry right now. I'm going to take the car. I'm going to kill him and take the car.

1099
04:14:27,739 --> 04:14:49,270
I can't believe it. That's what happens when you have the same button mapped to everything.

1100
04:14:52,040 --> 04:15:10,379
They've learned since then. Get the fuck away from me. Okay. Where is it?

1101
04:15:12,940 --> 04:15:28,469
Bang A left. No, just go straight. Is there anything else I can go faster with? I had that

1102
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:32,700
stupid shopping cart. I lost this shopping cart and that was a huge problem.

1103
04:16:41,719 --> 04:16:58,549
Okay. The next case will occur at 11 a.m. All right. The professor's passed, but that's

1104
04:16:58,549 --> 04:17:19,059
why is that so blocked out? Save it. Yep. Not that way. Not that way. Crap. Where am I going?

1105
04:17:19,780 --> 04:17:25,049
I'm coming down. You know when you're coming down after being really stressed out playing

1106
04:17:25,049 --> 04:17:40,979
something and then your brain sort of starts to try to unwind. All right. So I'm good. Free

1107
04:17:40,979 --> 04:17:50,709
roam time. I appreciate that. Thank you. Why don't you guys pose? I understand. Perfect.

1108
04:17:51,590 --> 04:18:02,139
No, I'm not. I'm not drugs. I'm talking about just when you don't matter. All right. Now look up.

1109
04:18:03,530 --> 04:18:30,920
Give me sad. Okay. What? No, turn back around. All right. I want a really good cinematic shot.

1110
04:18:31,719 --> 04:19:03,379
All right. Stop wasting photos. What happened? Free roam. Not enough time. He stabilized.

1111
04:19:04,020 --> 04:19:10,920
I had enough time to go to the bathroom. Are you all right? You have blood on you.

1112
04:19:11,879 --> 04:19:24,790
Huh? Yeah. Must be from that girl I saved. Girl? Was she hurt? I offered to help her, but

1113
04:19:24,790 --> 04:19:29,940
she took off. Must be from that bus full of children that I saved, you know.

1114
04:19:32,979 --> 04:19:39,530
Anyway, she was saying something about Santa Cabeza. Santa Cabeza? I think I...

1115
04:19:40,090 --> 04:19:47,100
Somebody turning? Dr. Barnaby, you're awake.

1116
04:19:47,819 --> 04:20:00,579
Santa Cabeza. I should have known. I thought Santa Cabeza was over and done with.

1117
04:20:01,979 --> 04:20:08,540
You plan to dispense justice now? Calm down, Dr. Barnaby. We're only following orders.

1118
04:20:09,180 --> 04:20:16,709
We have to protect you. Protect? More like imprison. Professor, if we're going to protect you,

1119
04:20:16,709 --> 04:20:23,110
we need to know the truth. I know who this is. All of it. Please. Who is this? Talk to us.

1120
04:20:23,989 --> 04:20:43,129
I take it you know what Santa Cabeza is. Am I right? All right. I have to get out of this

1121
04:20:44,010 --> 04:20:49,370
WWE 2k20 created character clothing in here. I'll just get my information somewhere else. Thank

1122
04:20:49,370 --> 04:21:03,670
you very much. Maybe if I can track down that woman again. All right. Let me see what I got.

1123
04:21:04,389 --> 04:21:10,819
Case number three coming up from 11 a.m. The next case will occur at 3 p.m. Oh, so I got

1124
04:21:10,819 --> 04:21:19,500
some free roam time. I actually really do. All right. I got some time. Is there anything else

1125
04:21:19,500 --> 04:21:40,309
I can do? The hatchet man and the coward. Coward. Say lovers A and B. I'm not gonna get there fast

1126
04:21:40,309 --> 04:22:05,399
enough. I'm the coward. Well, I'm not gonna get there fast enough. It's not all about doing the

1127
04:22:05,399 --> 04:22:11,260
missions. It's about I need I want to go and get some cool weapons and I want to change my clothes.

1128
04:22:17,770 --> 04:22:28,020
I want to press just press it up so I can throw further now. I think that's the last thing I

1129
04:22:28,020 --> 04:22:56,389
leveled up with. I sure did. Let's test it. Nice. Okay. Okay. Let's get some clothes. This is a

1130
04:22:56,389 --> 04:23:15,180
reading store. It's recharge the battery. I need a new weapon. They don't have anything. Oh wait.

1131
04:23:16,059 --> 04:23:27,270
Toy store. Fine. I'll put on like the joke outfit. Okay. Fine. Frisbee. That's actually pretty fun.

1132
04:23:28,069 --> 04:23:40,340
Check this out. Ready? Oops. Wrong button. Change clothes. All right. I can be the roblox guy.

1133
04:23:41,059 --> 04:23:59,940
What else can I do? Oh super soaker. Nice. Now this I remember this. This is what I remember.

1134
04:24:02,569 --> 04:24:05,610
I remember. Hey dude. I gotta go to the bathroom. Like you want to play for a minute?

1135
04:24:06,329 --> 04:24:14,059
Yeah sure man. And I did this for about 45 seconds. This is kind of fun game. Yeah. Yeah man.

1136
04:24:14,059 --> 04:24:31,139
Ready to go? Yeah. I'm ready to go. I'm not making this. This is not a joke. This is actually

1137
04:24:31,139 --> 04:24:50,629
happening with my time in Dead Rising 1. All right. What about over here? Kids clothing. Can I pick

1138
04:24:50,629 --> 04:25:04,680
the color shirt? No. I want a different outfit. I don't want just like the kids clothes. I was

1139
04:25:04,760 --> 04:25:13,579
already in this. There's no other style. It's only this. I have to be in like the man-child outfit.

1140
04:25:20,840 --> 04:25:28,329
Bowling ball. Nice. It's perfect for you. What about this? Oh wait. Hold on.

1141
04:25:29,049 --> 04:25:38,920
Oh no. I'm gonna Lefford. I'm gonna Lefford that myself. I think this is even worse.

1142
04:25:38,920 --> 04:25:47,000
Yeah. What about this? What's in here? There's two sides. Is it the same thing?

1143
04:25:47,479 --> 04:26:00,739
What the fuck just happened? All right. Can I? Is there a horse body that I can use?

1144
04:26:01,780 --> 04:26:18,389
Is it like a furry outfit? Is it like a furry suit? All right. Let's do the coward. What we got?

1145
04:26:18,389 --> 04:26:23,590
Weekly photo magazine. What does this do? Get a visual cue to indicate prime photo timing. That's

1146
04:26:23,590 --> 04:26:32,309
kind of cool. I'll use it for a while. I lost a scoop. Sports. Hold on to sporting goods three

1147
04:26:32,309 --> 04:26:42,540
times as long as usual. I'll use it for now. Hey Frankie. Did you get your homework done?

1148
04:26:42,540 --> 04:26:54,100
What? What's up? It's you again. I get it. We're all nervous when we're beginners.

1149
04:26:54,979 --> 04:27:05,020
Okay. Let me take a look. Show me your best shot. Uh oh. Am I gonna get judged? Get your

1150
04:27:05,020 --> 04:27:21,079
best erotica photo ready. I don't have any. This is just somebody sitting down. This one?

1151
04:27:21,799 --> 04:27:42,420
Beginner's luck. That's all. What? Did I just complete the mission? Just one more contest Frank.

1152
04:27:44,100 --> 04:27:54,139
Be here tomorrow at noon. We'll settle this. It's like an old medieval helmet. At noon tomorrow.

1153
04:28:06,040 --> 04:28:11,770
Cool. All right. So uh I have some of these. Okay wait. We're gonna go to the smoothie shop.

1154
04:28:13,180 --> 04:28:18,200
Pie. Can I? Is there a blender back here? Can I make a pie smoothie? That'd probably help.

1155
04:28:19,219 --> 04:28:29,350
Pamela. Wait. You'll be fine. Pamela. Pamela do you want a pie smoothie? I'm making two.

1156
04:28:29,350 --> 04:28:55,770
Wait. She's gonna die. No. Don't read. Fuck. I don't have any weapons.

1157
04:28:56,840 --> 04:29:09,190
I'm the worst help you could have asked for Pamela. Fuck. No. You brought the fucking sicko.

1158
04:29:09,909 --> 04:29:17,100
I need an actual weapon. Give me the cash register quick. Who the fuck are you? Heather.

1159
04:29:17,739 --> 04:29:37,989
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. You're in a weird spot. I mean I'm fashioner headed

1160
04:29:37,989 --> 04:29:47,319
but it's working. All right get up. Come on. Up here. You just please move your body up this way.

1161
04:29:48,200 --> 04:30:27,610
There's no more cash registers. There's no more cash registers. Oh my god. Nice job. I need that

1162
04:30:27,610 --> 04:30:35,620
book. What? Okay. Why can't I not just deselect? Like okay. If I have the book in my hand why can

1163
04:30:35,620 --> 04:30:39,860
I just select it? No unarmed. I want to keep the book but I don't want to have it in my hand to

1164
04:30:39,860 --> 04:31:06,389
read it. Why is it I cannot have unarmed? Follow me. Up on the d-pad. Take one of these.

1165
04:31:15,139 --> 04:31:25,989
Fuck you. I'm trying to help you. Stop that. You can't break...

1166
04:31:29,610 --> 04:31:39,850
I'm the worst guide. Okay so if I go this way I can go up right? No I don't need that. It's

1167
04:31:39,850 --> 04:31:56,440
right there. It's literally right here. This is very bad. This stuff sucks. I need... Okay I'm

1168
04:31:56,440 --> 04:32:03,850
gonna die. I'm not dying for this shit. Track this way. Follow me. Of course you guys are in

1169
04:32:03,850 --> 04:32:18,870
the toy store. Give me that book. Where? What are you doing over there? No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1170
04:32:18,870 --> 04:32:32,840
Yeah. This way. Okay. All right. All right. Nice work. Now I need to... All right. Jesus.

1171
04:32:35,579 --> 04:33:10,200
Straight up the way that I'm facing. Come here. Can I just... Let's open it again.

1172
04:33:10,200 --> 04:33:24,470
They'll give me an opportunity to try that again. I guess.

1173
04:33:25,909 --> 04:33:48,569
This is the one right? Where's the coward? Okay. All right. So now I'm going to...

1174
04:33:50,330 --> 04:33:57,669
I'm not going to be upset by that. I want some heals though. I don't know if there is any.

1175
04:33:58,310 --> 04:34:20,599
Is there any healing? What? I need a photo? Of what? Go take a... Wait I didn't take it?

1176
04:34:24,470 --> 04:34:46,979
All right. I'm just gonna take the same photo. I don't want to do this. I'm not... I didn't want

1177
04:34:46,979 --> 04:35:07,939
to zoom in on... I didn't... I just... Okay. I'm out. I have to be in this every single time.

1178
04:35:08,900 --> 04:35:19,180
It's just a nuisance to press the button in the elevator. All right. I'm gonna take some weapons.

1179
04:35:20,950 --> 04:35:26,470
So where was... Where's the photo contest? I think I kind of accidentally ran into it.

1180
04:35:28,700 --> 04:35:43,130
Second floor cafe. That's the one. Tell me what you want to tell me. Sandwich shop at Paradise

1181
04:35:43,130 --> 04:35:49,400
Plaza. I look pretty overweight from what I saw on the monitor. Okay. He's not going there to get

1182
04:35:49,400 --> 04:35:59,939
food. He's a restaurant man. We'll do restaurant man after coward. All right. Here we go. Camera

1183
04:35:59,939 --> 04:36:28,259
shop. Well I won't have time. Probably not. Upstairs cafe. Is it B? Oh it's a B. Nice. Cafe.

1184
04:36:28,259 --> 04:36:38,180
Which is over here. Remember we talked about the pie. Where is he? Was he over here or something? He

1185
04:36:38,180 --> 04:36:55,580
like ran into a... Where was this? Remember this is where I got the pie. I think it was another store.

1186
04:36:56,299 --> 04:37:16,360
He'll just come to you. Where are you at? Any clothes I can get in? Skateboard. That's good.

1187
04:37:16,360 --> 04:37:27,369
I'll take it. Golf club. I'll take it. Come back at 12. It's almost 12 right now. I'm gonna make some

1188
04:37:27,369 --> 04:37:54,470
smoothies. All right. So what we got? We have uh cans of drinks and uh pie. What do I get?

1189
04:37:55,189 --> 04:38:13,029
It's one pie. The ketchup or something I can dump in there. I ate the other pies. Why did I eat the

1190
04:38:13,029 --> 04:38:41,000
other pies? All right. Almost noon. I'm ready. Oh apples. I like apples and mangoes and shit.

1191
04:38:41,720 --> 04:39:03,720
All right. This is an apple pie. Different. Untouchable. I hear him. This is different too. What is this?

1192
04:39:03,720 --> 04:39:27,450
Nectar. All right. Hey. Where'd he go? I just heard him. Hey you are Frankie. Uh I just hurt my throat.

1193
04:39:28,009 --> 04:39:50,119
Beginner's luck. Come back tomorrow at noon. Beginner's luck. That's all. Here we go. And now I

1194
04:39:50,119 --> 04:39:56,259
have I have an actual weapon now. I have a skateboard and I have a pipe. Back to the

1195
04:39:56,259 --> 04:40:05,000
smoothie bar. And it's time to help her. Okay. I got I'm gonna make a double pie smoothie. Quickly.

1196
04:40:05,799 --> 04:40:19,479
Quickly. Quickly. Hurry up. Hurry up. Okay. Good. Let's go. I've got that. I've got a bug. I have a bug.

1197
04:40:20,279 --> 04:40:50,659
I'm gonna use it here. Bingo. You're safe. Picture first. Ah it's uh I fucked it up.

1198
04:40:50,659 --> 04:40:58,919
Thank you very much. Pamela Tomkins has joined. Okay. Let's follow me this way. And you.

1199
04:41:04,619 --> 04:41:17,340
Don't just let the thing attack you. I got both of you. All right. What should I give you guys?

1200
04:41:18,139 --> 04:41:32,779
How about um you guys got any boards? New skill. That one. I mean that was like a weird uh they were

1201
04:41:32,779 --> 04:41:35,979
doing like okay that was weird. Okay. New master the power push skill. How do I do that?

1202
04:41:41,830 --> 04:41:52,540
Here. Both of you take one of these. You can't give it to him? All right. Oh very important.

1203
04:41:53,180 --> 04:42:08,090
All right. Let's return. Let's go this way. It is the how do I get out of here? We're looking for

1204
04:42:08,090 --> 04:42:13,689
it's just this way into the left. Very easy. Just be able to get out quickly.

1205
04:42:17,979 --> 04:42:21,720
Don't have to hold both of their hands. I'm running out of time for the coward man.

1206
04:42:22,360 --> 04:42:48,060
What are you doing? Here. Why did you let go? Good. Hold on a minute. I got this.

1207
04:42:48,939 --> 04:43:13,130
Where's my weapon? Don't have a weapon? This way. Oh shit. Go. Go. Go. Go. Knife.

1208
04:43:14,759 --> 04:43:29,580
Seriously. This is bad. Nice push. Nice push. Nice push. Nice nice nice nice nice nice.

1209
04:43:30,470 --> 04:43:37,080
Made it. Stay with me. Stop. Don't cry. Don't cry. Come on.

1210
04:43:41,299 --> 04:43:55,180
Like yelling like their mother. Am I going the right way? I passed it. It's behind us.

1211
04:44:05,540 --> 04:44:28,500
Where are you going? Almost there. All right. We're safe. I might have to do restaurant man

1212
04:44:28,500 --> 04:44:49,450
though. Pamela. I know you can do it. There's no zombies. I'll take care of everything. Just

1213
04:44:49,450 --> 04:45:40,900
follow behind me. Let's go. I'm ready. In. Bingo. Pamela. Heather Tompkins. This place sucks. It's

1214
04:45:40,900 --> 04:45:51,049
dirty. It's cramped. Isn't there a shower around here? 60,000p. That's a lot of p.

1215
04:45:52,150 --> 04:45:57,610
Yeah. Speed up. Good. Speed increased. All right. I need to look at the move list.

1216
04:45:58,330 --> 04:46:03,220
Do I have enough time to do a coward? Okay. What about status?

1217
04:46:06,979 --> 04:46:13,349
Speed. Okay. Skills. Jump kick. I know that is zombie red. This skill allows you to climb on

1218
04:46:13,349 --> 04:46:17,990
unsuspecting zombies. You can even walk along the top of zombie crowds. Press A while pushing

1219
04:46:17,990 --> 04:46:25,159
left stick towards nearby standing zombies. I've done that. Kick back. When grabbed by a zombie,

1220
04:46:25,159 --> 04:46:30,299
repeatedly push left stick in the direction Frank is facing to deliver a kick to the attacker.

1221
04:46:30,299 --> 04:46:39,400
Repeatedly. Does that mean go? What does that mean? Just hold it. Okay. Flying dodge. Push

1222
04:46:39,400 --> 04:46:43,560
left stick in the same direction twice in rapid succession to throw yourself in that direction.

1223
04:46:43,560 --> 04:46:48,200
So it's a dodge. You are invincible at the beginning of this move, but the end will leave

1224
04:46:48,200 --> 04:46:53,029
you open for a moment. Okay. Avoid zombie attacks with this skill. When grabbed by a zombie,

1225
04:46:53,029 --> 04:46:58,389
repeatedly push left stick to the right or left to repel the attack and escape danger.

1226
04:46:59,189 --> 04:47:16,840
Save the game. Save it. Hurry. What am I holding? This is a really strange thing for me to say,

1227
04:47:16,840 --> 04:47:25,959
but that's inside computer shipping foam. That's exactly what that looks like at sleep.

1228
04:47:36,950 --> 04:47:41,450
If you buy a computer and you have it shipped to you, or if you make a computer for somebody

1229
04:47:41,450 --> 04:47:45,209
and you send it to somebody to protect the components inside, you put this weird foam

1230
04:47:45,209 --> 04:47:50,490
shit that you put it in it. Like it grows and it conforms to all the components. It's really

1231
04:47:50,490 --> 04:48:12,950
actually kind of an interesting thing. All right. I'm going for the coward. You are fucking demented.

1232
04:48:19,270 --> 04:48:26,299
No, people know what I'm talking about. I think I probably could do restaurant man too.

1233
04:48:30,119 --> 04:48:43,770
I just realized what character I am. I'm Rorschach from Watchmen. I'm going to keep this on.

1234
04:48:58,700 --> 04:49:13,459
Oh, the green mask. Rorschach's log. December 25th.

1235
04:49:16,020 --> 04:49:31,619
Stench of blood and foul things plague my nostrils. Hey, that was rough.

1236
04:49:47,580 --> 04:50:06,250
A camera. Oh no, he's going to put this on the internet.

1237
04:50:21,159 --> 04:50:30,220
Salvation. His blood must flow. He must be burned. Yeah. Why would you be filming that?

1238
04:50:30,220 --> 04:50:54,709
Why wouldn't you stop that? Yeah. Let's go. Hey, holy shit. He just charges forward.

1239
04:50:54,709 --> 04:51:13,939
And you guys coward. How about this one? Don't have a cow, man. That's not a heart

1240
04:51:13,939 --> 04:51:23,110
Simpson. What's wrong with me? Get off of me. Did I just end up in a box? Wait.

1241
04:51:30,259 --> 04:51:42,569
It's scripted. Some kind of old fashioned lock device. I need to enter a passcode.

1242
04:51:43,529 --> 04:52:03,720
That's your dad. That's it. Nice try. They all keep doing the same move.

1243
04:52:04,680 --> 04:52:09,909
I got to get it. I got to get it on camera. I've got to get it on camera. The three of them.

1244
04:52:09,909 --> 04:52:30,619
The charge. Come on. There's some Resident Evil shit here.

1245
04:52:32,060 --> 04:52:42,099
Resident Evil 4. It's the same dialogue. Holy fuck. He's running fast. I'm not going to put

1246
04:52:42,099 --> 04:53:07,849
you back in the box. Are you? How am I going to get through this? Oh, I thought I jumped over.

1247
04:53:11,130 --> 04:53:40,490
Give me a knife. Where's the knife? Give me a knife. Oh, I love crunching on their

1248
04:53:40,490 --> 04:54:01,020
Doritos is what gets their attention. That's a lot of PT, right?

1249
04:54:02,939 --> 04:54:05,740
Oh, fuck. That's so many people.

1250
04:54:10,060 --> 04:54:20,360
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not back in the box. That's it. How did none of these guys are dropping

1251
04:54:20,360 --> 04:55:10,840
knives? This is bad. I'm running out of time. Good step letter. I thought I died. Oh, fuck. Oh,

1252
04:55:16,459 --> 04:55:25,509
what? How do I get out of here? What is this? No, no, no. I need a better picture of that.

1253
04:55:25,509 --> 04:55:44,169
Better picture than that. Get fucking stuffed. Carve a box. I just like paper cut that guy's

1254
04:55:44,169 --> 04:56:01,909
face in half. You get the passcode. All right. Get rid of this thing. Did I already get it?

1255
04:56:08,860 --> 04:56:28,970
I already did it? I got it. Okay. Jennifer, are you all right? Why am I out here?

1256
04:56:39,909 --> 04:56:47,029
Oh, where's all my stuff? It's gone. Um, there's a wait a minute. Jill's sandwiches.

1257
04:56:49,029 --> 04:56:52,549
I don't know. I'm not gonna do either one of these. I didn't know where I am.

1258
04:56:53,349 --> 04:57:15,290
Where's their car? I'm not gonna be able to cover. I have to go back. I'm starving to death here.

1259
04:57:15,290 --> 04:57:26,709
What? Ronald? Ronald? Hey, you got some food, right? Split it with me. I'm dying here.

1260
04:57:35,979 --> 04:57:42,650
I don't have any food. I have to bring you food. Here, have some ketchup. Sorry, pal. Fresh out.

1261
04:57:43,450 --> 04:57:47,939
Trying to bowl guard it all for yourself, huh? You're just gonna eat every last morsel?

1262
04:57:48,819 --> 04:58:00,040
Okay. Well, I need to bring food then. There's nothing in this whole restaurant.

1263
04:58:00,759 --> 04:58:20,709
Well, okay. I found restaurant, man. What the fuck? Ronald! Now would be a good time.

1264
04:58:21,349 --> 04:58:34,979
Oh, this sucks. Um, I have to go back. Craft something? What do you mean craft something?

1265
04:58:35,139 --> 04:59:01,189
You craft something? Heat up a pan on the stove. I don't think I have time for this. Another...

1266
04:59:01,189 --> 04:59:09,110
I'm almost... This is almost done. Okay, and then it's on the frying pan. And now how do I...

1267
04:59:09,110 --> 04:59:26,099
What do I do? This is just a hot pan. I don't have any food. Flour? Uh, you're gonna have to stay there.

1268
04:59:26,099 --> 04:59:46,950
I have nothing. I have to go back. This is bad. I gotta go back to another source.

1269
04:59:47,029 --> 04:59:51,099
I gotta go back to another source. This is... This is just... My free-roam time is up.

1270
04:59:53,779 --> 05:00:00,540
Let me don't leave the map. Let's burn this... I bumped into his face.

1271
05:00:01,259 --> 05:00:11,669
All right, I have to go. I don't have food. I'm sorry. I'll go to the guitar shop.

1272
05:00:12,229 --> 05:00:34,459
Just take all the guitars. Food? Wait. No. Ronald, uh, you're dead. Goodbye.

1273
05:00:37,479 --> 05:00:53,270
I'm dead, too. I'm dead, too. I'm dead. I'm fine. All right, so where do I go from here?

1274
05:00:54,779 --> 05:01:01,099
We've got... Uh, I gotta go just down. I could save it. I'm gonna save it. Just because I die.

1275
05:01:03,700 --> 05:01:28,020
That was awesome. Now we just go back. Straight this way. And I end up right...

1276
05:01:28,819 --> 05:01:43,189
Straight ahead. Another source incoming. Why did I do this to myself? What do you want?

1277
05:01:52,060 --> 05:02:01,770
I just fucking breezed through that. That was stupid. What do you mean I'm soft-locked? Why?

1278
05:02:02,650 --> 05:02:55,580
Why would I be soft-locked? Oh shit, this is bad. Made it. Just in time. Motorcycle outside.

1279
05:02:56,459 --> 05:03:11,000
Okay, case four. There's a motorcycle now available. Girl hunting. Plug it back in.

1280
05:03:11,000 --> 05:03:17,060
All right, so I got plenty of time. Is the restaurant... Is he still alive, do you think?

1281
05:03:17,060 --> 05:03:35,590
Is the restaurant man still alive? He might be. Ah, he's dead.

1282
05:03:49,299 --> 05:03:59,049
I understand. Shit, I missed the... I missed the hands in the air. This is an intense conversation.

1283
05:04:01,930 --> 05:04:06,009
Wait, now I gotta get it from the side. Because they're doing the exact same thing. This is a

1284
05:04:06,009 --> 05:04:17,290
mirror. All right, wait till the... Wait till the big... The big one. Here it comes. One, two...

1285
05:04:26,169 --> 05:04:33,450
I haven't saved any pictures in a while. I'll make sure I save those ones.

1286
05:04:34,169 --> 05:05:04,569
Where's pants? There it is. Thank god. All right, I need to heal. Any more things to do?

1287
05:05:05,689 --> 05:05:12,540
Above the law. Okay, so let's do above the law. Do I have time to do them both? We'll find out.

1288
05:05:26,009 --> 05:05:47,669
Save one Ronald. It's the only mental we have of him. Got a little cocky on that one. Why don't I

1289
05:05:47,669 --> 05:06:03,319
heal? Because all I have is like fucking oil and hot sauce. Is there food here? Where is it?

1290
05:06:03,959 --> 05:06:10,869
Where is it? Is OJ here?

1291
05:06:25,509 --> 05:06:34,919
Where? I don't see any OJ. Does it respawn every time? I've already drank it.

1292
05:06:35,639 --> 05:06:53,830
I guess it only spawns once. Pepe hint. OJ. I'm not over here, right?

1293
05:07:00,419 --> 05:07:09,180
Okay. How was that? How's that a bronic? Oh, I just... Okay, I took it. That's my bad.

1294
05:07:20,009 --> 05:07:24,970
All right, let's do it again. Above the law. I think restaurant man is still alive. I think

1295
05:07:24,970 --> 05:07:36,360
Ronald's alive still. Let's see if I can get down there and eat something. I can get to bait him

1296
05:07:36,360 --> 05:07:46,180
out and throw the... Just throw shit at him. Now he is soft-locked. That's right. Yeah.

1297
05:07:46,340 --> 05:08:15,500
What? I understand. Go the other way. What do you mean other way? This is the only way I can go.

1298
05:08:16,380 --> 05:08:35,909
Like this way? Oh, a soccer ball. Oh, what's this? Did he fight the clown yet? Yeah, and I kicked his

1299
05:08:35,909 --> 05:09:01,700
ass. I died. Yeah, I died once. Yeah, I died one time. You got it. That's correct. There's some

1300
05:09:01,700 --> 05:09:20,340
good shit up here. No wine in there? All right, just tell me. There's a pretty big mall that you

1301
05:09:20,340 --> 05:09:29,509
probably need to use. Check the map. Otis, I know. All right, above the law. Let's do it.

1302
05:09:31,110 --> 05:09:40,700
Oh, let's get rid of the... Well, let's do something funny with the hot sauce first.

1303
05:09:40,700 --> 05:09:56,139
You know, throw it at somebody. Is that right? I missed. Does this explode? No, unless you do

1304
05:09:56,139 --> 05:10:04,040
something about it. All right, here we go. I just lost the only health that I picked up. Great. Nice

1305
05:10:04,119 --> 05:10:08,060
work, Jeremy. Everybody is cheering you on right now.

1306
05:10:15,159 --> 05:10:26,650
Restaurant. Restaurant is still up there. If I die again, I'm gonna fucking scream.

1307
05:10:27,450 --> 05:10:45,450
This... No, too many people. Cafe second floor? Is that now? That's today.

1308
05:10:47,979 --> 05:11:11,689
Ronald Shiner is dead. Food. Food. Gray hair. Nothing else I can wear?

1309
05:11:19,939 --> 05:11:30,619
All right, give me a suit or something. Why couldn't there be a suit store?

1310
05:11:33,029 --> 05:12:01,779
And no suit to wear. Yeah, yeah. That's not bad. I don't hate it. You just... I'm turning into the

1311
05:12:01,779 --> 05:12:13,819
Grand Theft Auto V cartridge. Nothing in here. Okay, sporting goods, energy drinks or something

1312
05:12:13,819 --> 05:12:23,209
I can take. I need healing right now. So badly. It's unbelievable to me.

1313
05:12:23,369 --> 05:12:41,830
Out of sight. Glasses? Cool. I'll take them. Let me look at the map. I gotta get used to hitting select.

1314
05:12:45,130 --> 05:12:52,419
So, there's a save point back here. Digital ladies space in the closet. Special gifts.

1315
05:12:53,060 --> 05:13:05,319
Men's apparel. Books. I need like a grocery store or something. Cosmetics. Boutique. I gotta go back

1316
05:13:05,319 --> 05:13:50,900
downstairs. Don't jump. Cheese. Burger cheese. Cheese tits. Cheese tits. I don't want to go that way.

1317
05:13:51,459 --> 05:14:00,459
That's dangerous out there. Food first. I've got plenty of time. We're gonna get something to eat.

1318
05:14:06,580 --> 05:14:29,979
Children's store. Grandma's kids. This thing's still burning? That's kind of unbelievable.

1319
05:14:30,060 --> 05:14:34,540
All right, where do I go? Where do I go for food? I'm not doing another big mission until I get

1320
05:14:34,540 --> 05:14:58,540
some food. Sports high. Gramen's space. Fashion. Apparel. Nothing back here. Uh, how about over here?

1321
05:14:58,540 --> 05:15:04,040
Hamburger fiefdom. Turn around and then take a left at the end of the junction.

1322
05:15:04,599 --> 05:15:22,220
But what did I say? What is it? Beef? Fife?

1323
05:15:23,180 --> 05:15:41,270
Yeah, that was very awkward. All right. Hamburger, uh, beef. Dome. Actually, this way?

1324
05:15:41,990 --> 05:15:55,049
Am I stupid? No, it is this way. Don't die here. Is it? I gotta get an opening.

1325
05:16:12,889 --> 05:16:29,979
Yeah. Hamburger. Fuck the closing in. Hamburger fiefdom. Found it. Please, we have to be food here.

1326
05:16:30,700 --> 05:16:43,529
Orange juice. Oh yeah. Perfect. Any other cans of beans or anything? Canned sauce. Can I eat this?

1327
05:16:49,400 --> 05:16:54,459
Can you actually cook? Or were you guys lying to me? You can't. I'm almost certain of that.

1328
05:17:01,220 --> 05:17:14,099
All right, I got orange juice. Good to go. Let's continue. We've got weapons. We've got health.

1329
05:17:14,659 --> 05:17:21,049
Got a pretty good spot here. Ah, all right. Listen to me. There's a woman taking over the

1330
05:17:21,049 --> 05:17:26,919
children's clothing shop in the entrance plaza. It looked pretty bleak. No more food. All right,

1331
05:17:26,919 --> 05:17:31,909
there is food here. There's milk. There's lots of milk. A woman. That woman who didn't make it.

1332
05:17:41,799 --> 05:17:54,470
Holy shit. That was unbelievable. I don't even know what to say. That was fucking insane.

1333
05:17:55,430 --> 05:18:06,250
It's a pinball machine. Okay, uh, get rid of the brown sugar. I want the milk.

1334
05:18:06,409 --> 05:18:14,360
The guitar sucks. Give me the other two things of milk. Did I already get them? I did. All right,

1335
05:18:14,360 --> 05:18:33,060
let's go. There's pies. I'll take both pies. Safe point. There's one right here. Blender. Ooh,

1336
05:18:34,180 --> 05:18:50,819
is there now? There is a blender over here. I didn't even see it. Milk and pie. It is a

1337
05:18:50,819 --> 05:19:08,020
zombate. Okay, pie and milk again. What does zombate do? Let's take a look. Spitfire.

1338
05:19:08,819 --> 05:19:23,110
Flushes harsh functions from your. All right, no more ingredients. There's two pies.

1339
05:19:27,419 --> 05:19:40,150
Can do double pie. Am I insane or was that like something that they did like glitch out or what?

1340
05:19:40,950 --> 05:20:15,130
It did. Okay, pie. I'm kind of, I need to, I'm running out of time here. Untouchable. Now I'm

1341
05:20:15,130 --> 05:20:23,540
good to go. Let's replace the guitar with the knife. I would say. Yeah. Save. Don't do that.

1342
05:20:23,540 --> 05:20:38,569
Select. Okay. Uh, banger right all the way down. Okay. All the way down. Save the game. Go this

1343
05:20:38,569 --> 05:21:13,669
way. Oh fuck, that's a lot of. Was that a mistake? Huh? Why did I just turn into a ball of like

1344
05:21:13,669 --> 05:21:43,029
bostura? These guys give a lot of experience points. It's worth it. Okay, that guy had

1345
05:21:43,830 --> 05:22:05,400
no hitbox. Oh, he's, he's exploding himself. I get it. Explode. All right. What's that safe point?

1346
05:22:06,040 --> 05:22:45,209
Bathroom. Slip right here. Dumbbell. Take two dumbbells. Save. All right. Out. Here we go.

1347
05:22:45,209 --> 05:22:56,819
So above the law is over here. Is it up or just down that way? Uh, is it in a restaurant or is

1348
05:22:56,819 --> 05:23:05,909
it just down the hall? It's just, it's in wonderland. Ooh, that if it's in wonderland, I can get a, uh,

1349
05:23:05,909 --> 05:23:25,799
a chainsaw. My special red wine shoot. Why is it going again? Sally? Uh, why is the thing moving

1350
05:23:25,799 --> 05:23:50,580
again? Help. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Stay right there. Don't move. Try just to kill them. Um,

1351
05:23:50,580 --> 05:24:06,939
this thing's supposed to break. No! Shit! Zombate. What does that do? Are they coming after me? Oh,

1352
05:24:06,939 --> 05:24:34,979
Nick! It baits the zombies. Well, come on over here, guys. Football tackle. Oh, shit. That was

1353
05:24:34,979 --> 05:24:46,229
a lot of people. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Keep going. Okay. Just a little bit further. How do I get them

1354
05:24:46,229 --> 05:24:58,419
down? Uh, I don't, I need, I need some more damage than this. They're not going to, I don't think I

1355
05:24:58,419 --> 05:25:19,459
can. This is too many. I'll be back. Hang on tight. I don't know what the hell I did that for,

1356
05:25:19,459 --> 05:25:55,860
but I think I missed. Wrong way. Fuck. I gotta go. Excuse me. Oh, God. Why? I just got up there,

1357
05:25:55,860 --> 05:26:15,369
too. They're okay. They're still hanging on. Watch me. Okay. Chainsaw. Now we have some fun.

1358
05:26:16,330 --> 05:27:11,419
Here I come. This is going to be ridiculous. It's already broken. Are you kidding me? Too

1359
05:27:11,419 --> 05:27:21,189
much effort from just one person here. I just like almost spit. When they fall, they land. I'm

1360
05:27:21,189 --> 05:27:37,830
going to take a picture of this. This is going to break too. Pick up the queen. I didn't get it.

1361
05:27:38,470 --> 05:27:57,529
There's so much shit all over the ground. Okay. Got a queen. Don't use it. Yes. Queen. Yes. Queen.

1362
05:27:57,529 --> 05:28:14,180
Yes. Queen. No, no queen. No queen. All right. Queen over here. Don't you dare. Queen it. Okay.

1363
05:28:14,180 --> 05:28:44,950
Um, fall. I got you. How do I get you down? How do I get you down from here? Jump. Can you walk?

1364
05:28:46,520 --> 05:28:54,779
I'm fine. It's nothing. All right. Sally Mills. Um, do you have anything? Do you like have anything?

1365
05:28:54,779 --> 05:29:33,779
I can. Thanks. Here. Take one of these. Take it. All right. Are you good? Nice dive, pal. You hurt?

1366
05:29:34,340 --> 05:29:49,959
I'm all right. Take me with you. Let's go. All right. Now above the law, I need something else.

1367
05:29:50,520 --> 05:30:00,709
This way. There's got to be like a store over here, right? Fashion house. Kelly and Lily.

1368
05:30:01,939 --> 05:30:04,900
There's too many people. They're throwing at me now. There's too many people.

1369
05:30:05,779 --> 05:30:23,560
I've got four people here. Beat up this cop so I can get the gun. Give me that. I swear to God,

1370
05:30:23,560 --> 05:30:47,860
you guys. Just fuck up the fucking stairs. Don't you dare do this to me. I don't care. What?

1371
05:31:06,979 --> 05:31:13,060
See just how shameless you are, you dirty little skank. Say hello to my new friend.

1372
05:31:14,259 --> 05:31:27,500
Not again. Help me. Officer. Officer. Can I talk to you for a minute? I mean,

1373
05:31:27,500 --> 05:31:31,849
uh, look, what did that woman do? Throw the camera.

1374
05:31:32,729 --> 05:31:44,700
Shut your pipe. If you interfere, official police business, start with you before I get to her.

1375
05:31:44,700 --> 05:32:12,860
Is this a boss? Where's my friends? Where are my friends? Are they in here? Here. Take the gun.

1376
05:32:13,740 --> 05:32:30,090
Use it. Use it. Shoot her. Somebody do something. Shoot her. Go and get her. Get her. I'll just do

1377
05:32:30,090 --> 05:32:39,750
this. I'll do this. You, you shoot. Oh fuck. He's going to die. Oh God. He's going to kill him. He's

1378
05:32:39,750 --> 05:32:51,740
going to kill him. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. What do I do? I need to throw a chair.

1379
05:32:57,049 --> 05:33:10,599
No, don't do something. Just keep getting in the way. I don't know. I'm scared.

1380
05:33:18,630 --> 05:33:37,990
Good job, Sally. Sally, good work. Stay right there. Sally, don't move.

1381
05:33:38,549 --> 05:33:41,750
No matter what you do, do not move at all. Stay right there.

1382
05:33:43,830 --> 05:33:50,409
What has he done? I spotted a guy in the cosmetic shop in the entrance closet.

1383
05:33:50,409 --> 05:33:59,689
I think he looks a little odd. You should check it out. I don't have any more weapons.

1384
05:33:59,689 --> 05:34:39,299
This might compromise Sally. Is he going to compromise Sally? I think. I don't know what to do.

1385
05:34:44,340 --> 05:34:47,860
Fuck. Look at all this blood. Gun? No.

1386
05:35:07,479 --> 05:35:19,799
I needed more guns. I needed more weapons. I had an interesting opportunity. Okay. I have

1387
05:35:19,799 --> 05:35:24,279
to save Nick again. I just thought that was another person and it was me and it freaked me

1388
05:35:24,279 --> 05:35:36,919
the fuck out. Okay. Above the law, I need guns. In fact, I've got a better idea. I'm getting

1389
05:35:36,919 --> 05:35:43,400
only chainsaws. Oh, I can't do that. Never mind. I'm just going up there with a chainsaw.

1390
05:35:47,590 --> 05:35:56,310
I just need a couple of distractions. I'm not going to use the chainsaw until I get there.

1391
05:35:57,270 --> 05:36:27,450
I'm ready. Let's go. Get rid of the dumbbell. That was a pretty good throw. It was. Okay. I also

1392
05:36:27,450 --> 05:36:31,689
am going to pick up the other chainsaw and I'm not going to use it for down here. I'm going to

1393
05:36:31,689 --> 05:36:41,380
kill a few people and then I'm going to get a bug. Understand? Do we understand? Mini chainsaw.

1394
05:36:42,020 --> 05:36:48,680
I'll come back. In fact, I could probably use this. Let's put this in place where I know it's

1395
05:36:48,680 --> 05:37:17,700
going to be. You know what? Fuck it. Let's go. Go get that chainsaw. Excellent. Don't use it.

1396
05:37:18,500 --> 05:37:29,000
Back over here. Here we go. I'm going to just, I'm going to get a queen.

1397
05:37:31,740 --> 05:37:45,000
Somebody's going to have a queen in here. Where's the queen? Somebody who's got red eyes.

1398
05:37:45,720 --> 05:37:53,209
Which one of you has red eyes? Show yourself, please. I appreciate it. Picture thought about

1399
05:37:53,209 --> 05:38:04,549
that. Let's get them both in the picture. What do you say? 5,000 points. Pretty good.

1400
05:38:05,189 --> 05:38:26,759
All right. Let me queen. Swing. Swing. What are you doing? You really just let that happen.

1401
05:38:27,560 --> 05:38:44,340
No queens yet. If I die right now, I will be so upset about this.

1402
05:38:45,700 --> 05:38:59,340
I don't want to use the chainsaw. Didn't the queen drop by this point? Man, this is bad.

1403
05:39:05,930 --> 05:39:29,689
I don't need to kill every zombie. No, I just need to kill one queen. Just farm chainsaws.

1404
05:39:30,250 --> 05:39:45,189
That's kind of cheating though, isn't it? Who cares? It's a gray area. Is that a queen? I think

1405
05:39:45,189 --> 05:39:53,139
I got one. That'll be huge if it is. You know what? I'm just going to use it a little bit.

1406
05:39:53,139 --> 05:40:07,619
Just a little bit. That's not a queen. Imagine not cheesing at dead rising.

1407
05:40:11,509 --> 05:40:31,509
Okay. Reading chat. Reading chat. Mistake number one was read chat. I just read it again. I just

1408
05:40:31,509 --> 05:40:58,139
read it again. What am I doing? Fuck it. Good luck. No, I'll come back. Here we go. Don't kill

1409
05:40:58,139 --> 05:41:22,380
her. Don't kill her. Don't kill her. I need a photo. No, that's not good enough. That's so good.

1410
05:41:22,380 --> 05:41:49,430
I'm saving that one. Wasn't centered. It's okay. I can't believe a worthless prick like you.

1411
05:41:49,430 --> 05:42:13,819
You killed me. What the hell? Oh my god. Okay. You obtained the handcuff key. Yeah. Stun gun?

1412
05:42:14,619 --> 05:42:26,360
Okay. So, let's... How do I unlock the keys? I have so... Wait. Stay here. Don't do this yet

1413
05:42:26,360 --> 05:42:42,659
because they're going to get attacked. Right? Oh, this is really bad. I need to... They're coming

1414
05:42:42,659 --> 05:42:49,029
in. They're coming in. I need... I have a queen, right? No, I don't. I still have some of this.

1415
05:42:55,959 --> 05:43:12,970
I didn't leave anybody, right? No, not hold hands. You're injured, but this is going to be really

1416
05:43:12,970 --> 05:43:49,909
bad. I'm going to sneeze. Anybody know? Is the chainsaw spawned? Stay there. Stay there.

1417
05:43:54,069 --> 05:44:20,709
Chainsaw respawned. I need a confirmation. Nice. Beautiful. All right. Now we're going to save

1418
05:44:20,709 --> 05:45:00,220
everybody. We're going to have six people coming. Stay up there. Are they okay? They're fine. They're

1419
05:45:00,220 --> 05:45:27,349
just hanging up. I need a queen. No queens. Finally. Took you long enough. All right. Get down.

1420
05:45:27,349 --> 05:45:47,080
Get down from there. Okay. I apologize in advance. All right. Let's go. Take me with you. We're going

1421
05:45:47,080 --> 05:46:04,889
to have so many people. Any more queens? Queen? Let's go. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me.

1422
05:46:04,889 --> 05:46:15,189
Talk to me. Where do you go? All right. Let's go. No, no, no, no. Nick, where are you going?

1423
05:46:16,360 --> 05:46:21,110
Nick, are you running up to like the girls up here? All right. Everybody follow me.

1424
05:46:22,009 --> 05:46:31,159
We're going to make this real quick. Oh, we went up to the marker. Okay. So this is important.

1425
05:46:31,159 --> 05:46:42,900
What's the fastest way to get over here? There's so many people. The shortcut. Right. Okay. And

1426
05:46:42,900 --> 05:46:52,790
that shortcut is over here. Right. That's the shortcut. Correct. Downstairs and over here.

1427
05:46:56,419 --> 05:47:08,889
Everybody listen to me. This is a shitload of people. One, two, three, four. Sally. I'm going

1428
05:47:08,889 --> 05:47:12,090
to give you guys some weapons or something. Even if it's a toy. I don't care. We need to like work

1429
05:47:12,090 --> 05:47:24,659
together. It's too many people. Let's go down. What can you guys carry? I don't know. This is

1430
05:47:24,659 --> 05:47:36,549
a lot of pressure right now. Which way is it? Up and to the left. Here. Take the gun.

1431
05:47:37,750 --> 05:48:04,549
Kelly, take the gun. Nick, take the gun. Nick, here. Take the gun. Let's go. He's so bad.

1432
05:48:05,110 --> 05:48:12,540
He's so bad at this. Okay. Keep going. Oh, why is he on top of me? Oh, shit.

1433
05:48:13,020 --> 05:48:14,080
Hey.

1434
05:48:15,659 --> 05:48:26,970
It's too many people. I'm fucking crumbling. I'm crumbling. Okay. Come on. Hurry up, Nick. Shoot

1435
05:48:26,970 --> 05:48:48,889
somebody. Let's go. To the left. Bang a left. That way. There it is. Sally, make it. We get six.

1436
05:48:48,889 --> 05:48:54,889
One, two, three, four, five, six. We do. Nice work. You know what, Nick? No. Fuck off, Nick. Give me

1437
05:48:54,889 --> 05:49:05,590
that gun. Here. Give me the gun. Janet. Oh, it was Kay. Nice work, Kay. You're way more useful.

1438
05:49:17,299 --> 05:49:21,540
That way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Wrong way. Bathroom?

1439
05:49:23,029 --> 05:49:38,279
Bathroom. All right. Let's go. Nick. Nick, give me the chainsaw back. How do I take it back?

1440
05:49:45,909 --> 05:50:01,450
Somebody hurt somebody. Use the chainsaw. Run. Run. Run. Uh-oh. Something's wrong. Sally,

1441
05:50:02,090 --> 05:50:27,159
give me the fucking chainsaw. No. No, Kay. Come on. Go. Let's go. We're so close. Good. Good. Good.

1442
05:50:27,159 --> 05:50:33,380
Good. All of you. All of you. All of you. All of you. All of you. Nice shot. Into the bathroom.

1443
05:50:36,900 --> 05:50:50,520
One. The only fucking reliable one, Kay. Only reliable person. You motherfucker. Get in.

1444
05:50:59,900 --> 05:51:06,119
Get out of the way. Sally's in trouble. No. Turn. Give me this chainsaw.

1445
05:51:06,919 --> 05:51:15,080
Get out of the fucking way. Stop pushing people. Oh, my God. I'm gonna run out of time.

1446
05:51:15,080 --> 05:51:19,799
All right. Get in the bathroom. Get in the bathroom.

1447
05:51:23,560 --> 05:51:40,549
In. Oh. Just press it. They're not gonna all make it. Don't they all have to be in here?

1448
05:51:40,549 --> 05:51:43,430
They all have to be in here, don't they? Is that gonna work?

1449
05:51:51,860 --> 05:51:56,740
None of them made it in. I just want to make that real clear. All you jokers in here.

1450
05:51:56,740 --> 05:52:10,380
Not only one person made it in. He's blocking the way. He's blocking the path. That's the problem.

1451
05:52:13,509 --> 05:52:48,250
Nick Evans defected. I'm gonna fucking throw up. Hello. I spotted somebody in the cosmetic shop.

1452
05:52:50,250 --> 05:52:54,520
Holy shit. That was awesome. What are we supposed to do?

1453
05:52:54,520 --> 05:53:09,299
Did she just shoot herself in the head? What happened?

1454
05:53:23,060 --> 05:53:26,659
I just heard like a gunfire and then a flat landing person.

1455
05:53:34,340 --> 05:53:40,020
Set the marker in the bathroom. Get in here. Oh, now they all. Now they all comprehend it.

1456
05:53:40,740 --> 05:53:44,500
You all get it now? Interesting. I didn't do anything. They all just went one, two, three,

1457
05:53:44,500 --> 05:53:54,680
four, five, six. Follow me. Okay. We all good? One, two, three. It's like wow nameplates. One,

1458
05:53:54,680 --> 05:54:08,889
two, three, four, five, six. We're good. Save it right here. Give me that fucking weapon.

1459
05:54:08,889 --> 05:54:18,069
I can't get it from them. Okay. Now from here, it's as easy as coming out this door,

1460
05:54:18,069 --> 05:54:42,970
taking a left, going in the elevator. Set a waypoint. One, two, three, four, five. One,

1461
05:54:42,970 --> 05:54:50,180
two, three, four, five. Let's go. Who's not in there? Who's not in there? This is so bad.

1462
05:54:50,180 --> 05:54:57,619
I need a weapon. I'm going to teleport. Hold on. Wait, what is that on the ground? I'm going to die

1463
05:54:57,619 --> 05:55:06,299
over here now. What happened? Trade. I don't even care. Just take this. I don't even care if you

1464
05:55:06,299 --> 05:55:19,180
heal. Can I give this to you? Take this, please. I need to use. I need that weapon. This is a fucking

1465
05:55:19,180 --> 05:55:30,099
mess. This is a mess. I just took the zombie bait. Oh, that's bad. Wait, everybody stay back.

1466
05:55:30,979 --> 05:55:42,279
Go that way. I'll be back in a minute. I just need a weapon. Books. Books. Books. Books. Books.

1467
05:55:42,279 --> 05:55:48,740
All there is is books. Books. Books. Books. Books. Books. Books. Books. T-shirts. Books. Books. T-shirts.

1468
05:55:49,299 --> 05:56:00,619
I just need a board. A piece of wood. A cash register. Anything. God damn it. Okay. Now I

1469
05:56:00,619 --> 05:56:22,340
got to get out of here. How did the glass not break? Okay. Move out of my way. Okay, everybody.

1470
05:56:22,340 --> 05:56:33,779
Which way do we go? This way. Make sure I'm facing the right direction. Straight ahead. Let's go.

1471
05:56:35,880 --> 05:56:59,799
Let's go. Wait, you have a gun. Let's go. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't

1472
05:56:59,799 --> 05:57:26,330
stop. We got to move now. Who's in trouble? Just make your way over there. Who's grabbed? Who died?

1473
05:57:26,330 --> 05:57:37,189
Kelly. Kelly, you're the smartest one. There. Go. No. Okay. No.

1474
05:57:48,599 --> 05:57:55,000
To swap weapons with Nick? I can't. I have to, like, I can't give him the cash register and

1475
05:57:55,000 --> 05:58:28,380
all there is is shoes. I'm gonna die. Um, Jesus Christ. What happened? This is fucking terrible.

1476
05:58:35,080 --> 05:58:44,009
Okay, everybody stay in the bathroom. Stay in the bathroom. In fact, I still have a heel. Okay,

1477
05:58:44,009 --> 05:58:57,380
this is fine. All of you do not fucking move. Stand in the corner. I need to get a bat in the

1478
05:58:57,380 --> 05:59:06,299
sports store. Where's the sporting goods store? You already fucked it up. Sporting goods store.

1479
05:59:06,299 --> 05:59:23,860
Where are you? Let me see. Toy box. Book store. Let me see the map. Optics. Clothing. Jewels.

1480
05:59:25,060 --> 05:59:36,520
Kids store. DVDs. Reading. Cameras. Shoes. Sandwiches. Toon makers. Where is this?

1481
05:59:40,139 --> 06:00:05,930
Bookporium. Oh, come on. We're the bats. I'll take a skateboard. Golf clubs. Got it.

1482
06:00:05,930 --> 06:00:08,729
Nice. Take just, like, three of them. Who cares? Everyone's gonna have a golf club.

1483
06:00:09,619 --> 06:00:14,819
At least four of us have to have golf clubs. And, you know, get rid of the fucking skateboard. Give

1484
06:00:14,819 --> 06:00:25,209
me that. No, all of us are gonna have bats. It don't matter. It don't matter. It don't matter.

1485
06:00:25,209 --> 06:00:53,340
It doesn't matter. Save it. Where the fuck did I just go? Okay. Hi, guys. How are you? Take a club.

1486
06:00:59,380 --> 06:01:21,819
Nick, take a club. Nick, you welcome. Why won't they take the golf club? I don't have time for this.

1487
06:01:25,540 --> 06:02:03,099
Oh, let's go. Okay. This way. Left. Down. How we doing? We're not doing that too bad.

1488
06:02:03,099 --> 06:02:05,819
We're getting a hairy situation. I have a little bit of chainsaw left.

1489
06:02:07,900 --> 06:02:36,630
Everybody good. Keep going. Don't you dare. Move. K, come on. We're so close. Come on.

1490
06:02:37,909 --> 06:02:54,409
Come on, K. Almost there. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Guys, just go,

1491
06:02:54,409 --> 06:03:01,720
go, go. Run, run, run. They're slow. They're really slow. Holy shit. The golf club sucks.

1492
06:03:02,439 --> 06:03:22,729
How do I leave? One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Get away from

1493
06:03:22,729 --> 06:03:36,970
my backswing. Lily, away from the backswing. No, don't fucking ruin this. Everybody go that way.

1494
06:03:37,209 --> 06:04:15,099
Go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Go. Who's dead? I got six turn-ins here.

1495
06:04:15,099 --> 06:04:30,220
Jerry. What was his name? Nick. That was not cool. Come on. Come on. Come on. I know. I know. I know.

1496
06:04:31,340 --> 06:04:42,360
Everybody, this is important. This is really, really important. I need you all

1497
06:04:43,240 --> 06:05:02,840
to just stand literally right there. Okay. Good. One, two, three, four, five, six.

1498
06:05:04,119 --> 06:05:20,069
I'm going to get like fucking 500 million points for this. Two, three, four, five, six. Come on.

1499
06:05:20,950 --> 06:05:31,939
You can do it. Nick, you take, you take up like the whole thing. Just somebody please go.

1500
06:05:32,819 --> 06:05:44,740
You just have to be in this right area. Guys, stop this nonsense. Get up.

1501
06:05:45,700 --> 06:06:13,580
Up. Up. Up. Go. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six. All of them. Did I level play? I still

1502
06:06:13,580 --> 06:06:27,139
have like three times. 240,000 people. Holy shit. That's a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, time. Oh, no, no, no,

1503
06:06:27,139 --> 06:06:43,720
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Where is this? I don't have to go. I have no time.

1504
06:06:44,439 --> 06:06:45,799
I have to save it, but I have no time to save.

1505
06:07:34,200 --> 06:07:37,000
All right. Help me out here, guys. Help me out here. Uh, is there a shortcut? Should I take a

1506
06:07:37,000 --> 06:07:49,720
shortcut? Well, help me out here. Or do I have to run? Just, I have to just run. Just run. Just run.

1507
06:07:50,439 --> 06:08:01,080
Grab a skateboard. Nice. Get off the. Oh, this I screwed up. You come in at the wrong fucking

1508
06:08:01,080 --> 06:08:27,340
times. I got, I can't, I gotta go. I gotta go. No, I don't. Movie land. How did I do three golf

1509
06:08:27,340 --> 06:08:43,130
clubs? That was so stupid. All right. Oh, you can talk to me now. Old man in the antique shop.

1510
06:08:44,299 --> 06:08:56,810
He seems weird. He's calm. No, I'm good. There's more. Spotted a guy at the cosmetic shop at the

1511
06:08:56,810 --> 06:09:05,259
entrance plaza. That's fine. I'm not going to go there. There's a sniper over there probably.

1512
06:09:05,259 --> 06:09:27,959
All this stuff. I was too busy saving six people. Okay. Give me this. Give me this. Get out of the

1513
06:09:27,959 --> 06:09:49,590
way, bitch. It was rude. But circumstance. It's not this way. It's not this way. Turn. Don't blow

1514
06:09:49,590 --> 06:10:05,900
that up. I'll get there. Big bits of rude streamer. Uh, thank you. Nits cat for the 5,000 bits.

1515
06:10:06,779 --> 06:10:13,020
Appreciate it. Thank you. I can't believe you got all six. Thanks for the laughs. Trying to round

1516
06:10:13,020 --> 06:10:24,279
them all up. Loving the stream. Keep it up. Am I going to try to chase this person? I have to beat

1517
06:10:24,279 --> 06:10:45,080
her before I run out of time. Oh, this is not good. This is bad. No. All right. Let's go.

1518
06:10:45,880 --> 06:11:15,159
Did she just crash? I didn't get a single hit. Well, at least I know I can get over there.

1519
06:11:15,159 --> 06:11:37,060
I can go to the gun store. Yeah. I'm going to go to the gun store. That's not a bad idea. All right.

1520
06:11:37,060 --> 06:11:46,150
Let's pull it up. Uh, there's probably a better save point I can do besides this. Just go get

1521
06:11:46,150 --> 06:11:50,860
the OP chainsaw. Let me see if I can do it without it. That's, I don't want to use that as a crutch.

1522
06:11:54,119 --> 06:11:58,169
I have plenty of time to get down here. The gun store is near the bus anyways. Okay.

1523
06:11:58,169 --> 06:12:09,500
Okay. Plus there's a shopping cart there so I can get there quickly.

1524
06:12:11,419 --> 06:12:14,220
I'm just going to get down there. I'm going to save the game in a bathroom that's over there.

1525
06:12:14,860 --> 06:12:32,939
I'm going to use the knife. Not bad. Wrong way. I don't really care about Otis. He's going to

1526
06:12:32,939 --> 06:12:37,500
say the same shit that he said in the Times already. Find the person. Yeah, I don't have time

1527
06:12:37,500 --> 06:12:59,049
for that. I took too long. Okay. Put some shoes on you freak. No, better traction. All right.

1528
06:12:59,130 --> 06:13:08,659
Big deal. I'll get this wall and then when I get in here I got to find a save point

1529
06:13:08,659 --> 06:13:33,700
so I can go right from here. There we go. Not bad. And then in here I'm going to do a little bit of

1530
06:13:34,500 --> 06:13:49,049
investigating. All right. Let me take a look. So in here we've got home and garden,

1531
06:13:49,049 --> 06:14:00,650
movie land. We've got, wait a minute, this is here. Hunting shack. So if I bang a left,

1532
06:14:01,369 --> 06:14:04,970
is there no save point? Okay. There is a save point, but I don't, I don't. Okay. So if I go

1533
06:14:04,970 --> 06:14:09,610
down here through the plaza and then bang a little right in here, there's a firearm shack.

1534
06:14:10,330 --> 06:14:42,759
Okay. You got it. This bullshit. Time for the shit. Okay. Let's go. And there's a save point

1535
06:14:42,759 --> 06:15:00,810
right down there too. I can't take a call and I'm driving. That's not safe. All right. Now wait.

1536
06:15:00,810 --> 06:15:15,099
It's behind me and in the little corner over here. This way. There it is. All the way down.

1537
06:15:15,740 --> 06:15:24,919
Okay. Leave that. Why is this like a cut scene? Who's this?

1538
06:15:41,099 --> 06:15:52,810
Okay. But they're dead. It was just a random person. Now they're dead.

1539
06:15:56,569 --> 06:15:57,450
This is a boss fight.

1540
06:16:06,180 --> 06:16:31,659
I didn't even, I'd missed completely. So there, is this blocking? I don't have any guns.

1541
06:16:32,299 --> 06:16:38,470
He's loading. He's loading. He drinks. Drinks. Drinking. Drinking. Drinking. He's drinking.

1542
06:16:38,470 --> 06:16:41,990
I'm dead. I'm gonna die. I'm dead. How many times have I been like, I'm dead. I'm dead.

1543
06:16:41,990 --> 06:17:11,099
I'm dead. I'm dead. No, that's it. I'm dead. It's bullshit. Oh, it's actual bullshit. Oh well.

1544
06:17:11,740 --> 06:17:46,099
Damn it. Go load up on baseball bats. No, I think I could kill her. It's going to take a little bit

1545
06:17:46,099 --> 06:18:07,049
of crutch bullshit, but I can do it. I also need to save some for tomorrow too.

1546
06:18:08,090 --> 06:18:14,860
Oh, whatever. It's been six hours. Yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I want to save it for tomorrow.

1547
06:18:15,580 --> 06:18:28,779
This game's long. Yeah, I'm having fun. No, no, let me just do this first.

1548
06:18:31,080 --> 06:18:35,689
You're only halfway through. That's what I mean. Because I'm streaming this tomorrow.

1549
06:18:36,569 --> 06:18:57,299
So I'd like to have another full stream tomorrow too. All right. This way and then

1550
06:18:58,180 --> 06:19:08,020
let me look at this. Once I get over here, I'm not gonna, how do you even get down that far?

1551
06:19:08,900 --> 06:19:16,470
It's like another six hours. Yeah, that's perfect. I'll, you know, I'll give this one more attempt

1552
06:19:17,029 --> 06:19:21,639
and then we'll call it. If I do it, I do it. And if I don't, I don't. We'll do it again. We'll do it

1553
06:19:21,639 --> 06:19:27,299
tomorrow. Because that will be a good six to seven hours then six to seven hours tomorrow.

1554
06:19:27,299 --> 06:19:45,590
And that lines up pretty perfectly. Don't run straight into nothing. The golf club's really

1555
06:19:45,590 --> 06:20:01,419
awful. Am I going to do death stranding? I don't think so. I don't. And not because I don't think

1556
06:20:01,419 --> 06:20:11,419
the game is going to be any good, but because I think it's going to be long and a lot of story,

1557
06:20:11,419 --> 06:20:18,020
which is good, but I'm not sure that's something I want to scream. No, why would you do that?

1558
06:20:19,060 --> 06:20:21,349
I have plenty of time. I don't have to freak out.

1559
06:20:21,349 --> 06:20:30,599
And now I'm going to try to save it over here. I'm sure it's going to be interesting.

1560
06:20:35,259 --> 06:20:42,279
Go all the way. Where's the safe point? Do I have to go all the way? Maybe I don't have to.

1561
06:20:43,080 --> 06:20:58,580
I'm going to save this in a different slot. Can I bang a right? Where the hell is this?

1562
06:20:59,909 --> 06:21:20,700
Right next to me? Easy. Different slot, just in case something horrible happens.

1563
06:21:22,500 --> 06:21:28,020
Okay. So regardless, I have a way. I'm going to beat it tomorrow because I'm stuck here.

1564
06:21:28,900 --> 06:21:46,360
It's either this or nothing. I have to do it. You were just off camera. Let's see if I can kill him.

1565
06:21:47,159 --> 06:22:13,240
There we go. Got that gun too. Any weapons up here? What's that? A nail gun. I fell off.

1566
06:22:14,520 --> 06:22:38,330
I don't have any heals either. No, I didn't get it. There's no time for this. Just kill her.

1567
06:22:38,889 --> 06:22:55,799
Where are you going? What? Wait, what? Is she coming back? I see a headlight. What the

1568
06:22:55,799 --> 06:23:00,200
fuck just happened? She's not going to come down. You've got to be kidding me.

1569
06:23:03,049 --> 06:23:17,770
All the way up. Am I safe? I'm safe in here. She's a fucking maniac. Have you ever

1570
06:23:17,770 --> 06:23:35,479
rode on a motorcycle before? I'm almost out of time. She just drove away again. I'm going

1571
06:23:35,479 --> 06:24:07,830
to try to crash into her. This is fucking outrageous. She turns so fast like on a dime.

1572
06:24:07,830 --> 06:24:24,150
What if I stay in the corner? She can't get me here. I lost. Okay. So I got to kill her quick.

1573
06:24:24,790 --> 06:24:35,029
I'll give it one more time. One more time. Maybe just hit her in the head with a board.

1574
06:24:35,029 --> 06:24:46,150
I don't know. I wonder how do I get, can I get it off of the, there's a sword shop next to her.

1575
06:24:46,869 --> 06:24:51,130
I don't even think the shopping cart's not doing anything for me right now.

1576
06:24:53,529 --> 06:25:00,409
Wait, is there? What is it? Sean's food, CD crazy, and then Ripper's blade is just straight ahead.

1577
06:25:01,529 --> 06:25:09,430
Try the bomb cart. I have to make it explode, don't I? That's a lot, asshole.

1578
06:25:10,470 --> 06:25:18,409
You don't have any time to do this. This is precious seconds I'm wasting.

1579
06:25:20,950 --> 06:25:23,509
Just for the love of God, this is fucking sacred. Get away from me.

1580
06:25:24,470 --> 06:25:43,000
Okay, let's try it. Can I just put it down in front of her? Um, it's gone. Just true.

1581
06:25:43,880 --> 06:25:54,810
They don't really give you even one tenth of a second, do they? I just want to see what's even

1582
06:25:54,810 --> 06:26:13,860
in the fucking room. What the hell is this encounter? It's because I'm not wearing shoes?

1583
06:26:14,659 --> 06:26:30,439
That's not real. What do you mean yes? I have a handicap because I don't have shoes on.

1584
06:26:30,759 --> 06:26:40,540
Don't tell me that's real. Is that real? All right, she's not going to come in here.

1585
06:26:40,540 --> 06:26:55,930
And if she does, then she's in trouble. Okay, what do we got? I can't even open the goddamn

1586
06:26:55,930 --> 06:27:04,919
case. Thanks for opening the case. Why are you even in here? Oh my God, I want to fucking bury you.

1587
06:27:06,279 --> 06:27:22,840
Katana. All right, all it takes is one good Katana swing. This is like the sloppiest fight ever.

1588
06:27:22,840 --> 06:28:03,669
I feel like I'm playing GTA right now. Jesus. She's stuck. She's moving around like a mouse.

1589
06:28:04,470 --> 06:28:21,560
Okay, got it. Got one hit on her. I have an idea. I'm gonna try to bait her into the shop

1590
06:28:21,560 --> 06:28:25,799
and have her stuff in the shop and get stuck in there. Let's see if it works.

1591
06:28:36,360 --> 06:28:58,069
You. Give me your gun. No gun? Didn't have a gun. Any more police? Here we go. She's in.

1592
06:28:58,630 --> 06:29:19,369
She's in. Come on. Get in. She was in. God damn it, she was in. I had her in. This is the most

1593
06:29:19,369 --> 06:29:36,790
absurd thing I've ever seen. Let's go. Now you're gonna use your gun. Get in, get in. In, in, in.

1594
06:29:36,790 --> 06:29:52,180
Is she in? Fuck. Wasn't the best. I'll take the sword. All right, time to slay the dragon.

1595
06:29:52,819 --> 06:30:28,790
Can I like queue it up? That's the play. That's the play. That's the only way this is going to

1596
06:30:28,790 --> 06:30:36,380
work. I have to do that like 10 times in a row. Well, she just gets. I don't even know what the

1597
06:30:36,380 --> 06:30:42,840
actual strategy here is. What are you actually supposed to do here? What's like the real way

1598
06:30:42,840 --> 06:30:55,220
to do this? You have to use a gun. What if I don't have a gun? I need food and guns. Well,

1599
06:30:55,220 --> 06:31:04,439
I don't have any time for that. I have to win. Is there any place over here? There's food over here

1600
06:31:05,159 --> 06:31:08,090
I could get a bunch of food, but I'm not going to do it in time.

1601
06:31:14,540 --> 06:31:26,150
Guns. I need a gun. Police. Come here. You got a gun. Give that to me.

1602
06:31:28,330 --> 06:31:39,240
Get the fuck out of here. All right, hold on. Give me the O2 tank. You've got two? No. All right,

1603
06:31:39,240 --> 06:31:55,110
I have a gun. You've got two? No. Okay. Where's that O2 tank? There it is. Don't shoot the O2

1604
06:31:55,110 --> 06:32:27,430
tank. Give me the tank. It fucking despawns. Oh my god. That's so stupid. You have no time.

1605
06:32:28,389 --> 06:33:05,500
I can't even go in the... Is there somebody else in here? What? Okay, so you can't go in there.

1606
06:33:06,139 --> 06:33:12,869
I have to shoot her with that gun. I have to shoot at the propane tank. It has to be more

1607
06:33:12,869 --> 06:33:20,220
perfect than landing a fucking triple axle in the Olympics. Where's the guy with the gun? Over here.

1608
06:33:20,540 --> 06:33:34,169
I've got three guns. I've got to save it right now. Get the fucking stupid NPC shitheads. Get away

1609
06:33:34,169 --> 06:33:40,970
from me. Get out of here. Is this three? Oh, I am so angry right now. You have no idea. This is so

1610
06:33:40,970 --> 06:34:17,209
stupid. Give me this. God damn it. Don't tell me it's because I don't have any shoes on.

1611
06:34:17,930 --> 06:34:41,189
Nice climb, Frank. Where are you? Where? This is fucking unbelievable.

1612
06:34:41,990 --> 06:34:50,299
How do you ever... Mouse and keyboard. How do I aim? How do I aim with mouse? What's like zoom in?

1613
06:34:50,299 --> 06:35:08,250
What's aim on mouse? It's not right click. W? Q? Get back here. Why would Q be... I'm so upset by that

1614
06:35:08,250 --> 06:35:21,939
one. Where did she go? This game makes no sense. What the hell is going on right now? What is going

1615
06:35:21,939 --> 06:36:01,509
on? This is fucking ridiculous. This is like I'm dead. Oh my god. Just throw katanas at her.

1616
06:36:02,619 --> 06:36:17,930
Strategy number two incoming. It just happens every fucking time. Keep using the gun. I can't

1617
06:36:17,930 --> 06:36:22,729
get a good shot. She rips around so much. Even when you shoot her, sometimes you hit her in the

1618
06:36:22,729 --> 06:36:34,950
motorcycle. I'm just going in here. Go ahead, spin around. Nice turning. Great programming on the

1619
06:36:34,950 --> 06:36:50,659
turning of the bike there. Who did that? It's bad. Give me the knives. Fuck out of here. Let's go.

1620
06:36:51,380 --> 06:37:25,220
She's spinning in circles now. No fucking way. It's possible, but can I even do this in time?

1621
06:37:46,139 --> 06:37:49,099
I don't know how much time I actually have left.

1622
06:37:49,099 --> 06:38:15,509
Okay, okay. No, man. No, no. I have to swing when she gets close. It's my easier set than done.

1623
06:38:17,740 --> 06:38:25,029
Just jump kick her. All right. Honest to god. I'm going to break this thing in half. Why does

1624
06:38:25,029 --> 06:38:42,470
this Xbox One control suck such asshole? I don't understand. She hasn't even run into me. It's

1625
06:38:42,549 --> 06:39:00,279
already over. My god, this thing sucks. You got to be fucking kidding me. What a piece of dog shit.

1626
06:39:01,740 --> 06:39:09,880
Why is it disconnected? What? She was waiting for me to be plugged back in. At least I appreciate

1627
06:39:09,880 --> 06:39:36,790
that. That's nice of you. I think I might just lose this. Hey, wait a minute. That jump scare is

1628
06:39:36,790 --> 06:39:41,700
out the window. Hi, guys. Yeah, we were just waiting for you. When you turn the corner,

1629
06:39:41,700 --> 06:39:54,950
we just all bite you at the same time. The thing doesn't even do anything. And the guns,

1630
06:39:54,950 --> 06:40:03,799
I feel like they do like a sliver of health. Throwing the katanas was doing more damage.

1631
06:40:04,360 --> 06:40:24,439
You had a bigger gun. Look at the time. I might have to go back to one of the other saves. It's

1632
06:40:24,439 --> 06:40:43,639
actually fucking broken. I'm going to mail this thing back to fucking Microsoft. This is so fucking

1633
06:40:43,639 --> 06:40:58,740
broken. No, she was just, she was just stuck right here.

1634
06:41:01,900 --> 06:41:22,599
This is unfucking believable. Just shoot her. Just shoot her. I can't even do enough damage to her.

1635
06:41:39,880 --> 06:41:44,119
All right. Is it like a chandelier that I can drop on her fucking head or something? Like,

1636
06:41:44,119 --> 06:42:01,849
seriously? This seems so outrageously stupid. Even with a gun. This isn't it, man. I just don't have

1637
06:42:01,849 --> 06:42:16,490
enough time. So I just lose. I'm just going to lose. Go get the gun from the fountain. I'd love

1638
06:42:16,490 --> 06:42:22,650
to play. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm done. Game over. I'm done. I have to,

1639
06:42:22,650 --> 06:42:26,569
I have to like fix this. I can't play with keyboard and mouse right now. I'm playing for like

1640
06:42:26,569 --> 06:42:41,880
seven hours with controller. I have to figure out why this keeps disconnected. We're going to do

1641
06:42:41,880 --> 06:42:49,990
it tomorrow. I'm going to figure it out tomorrow. I'm going to go to the fountain. You know, just

1642
06:42:49,990 --> 06:43:09,750
kill me. Here she comes. Oh, insult to injury ran over my head. You got to get shoot. All right.

1643
06:43:09,750 --> 06:43:20,299
Where was, I'm just curious. So this is, I have two saves here. Where is this one? It's all the way

1644
06:43:20,299 --> 06:43:36,470
back. All right. Fountain, Uzi. I don't even know how to use the map. Is it M? Okay. Where's that

1645
06:43:36,470 --> 06:43:44,340
fountain? I have no idea even how to control this fucking game with a keyboard. What is going on?

1646
06:43:50,439 --> 06:44:01,590
All right. There's the food court. Where's the fountain? Not up here. This game sucks laughing

1647
06:44:01,590 --> 06:44:16,520
my ass off. It doesn't though. It actually doesn't. All right. So it's here. Can I get here

1648
06:44:17,639 --> 06:44:24,650
and then up here? I'm going to have to just run over this way, grab a skateboard and skateboard

1649
06:44:24,650 --> 06:44:44,970
all the way around. Is that going to work? I don't know. Into the food court, grab some food.

1650
06:44:47,610 --> 06:44:53,860
Hold on. Do I even have like another plug I can try? I'm so irritated by this. What a cheap piece

1651
06:44:53,860 --> 06:45:02,259
of shit. Seriously. Yeah. Like coffee pays like fucking 500 million of these things and then

1652
06:45:02,259 --> 06:45:17,509
dump them up at 80 bucks. Give me a break. We'll go ahead and send that to our quality control

1653
06:45:17,509 --> 06:45:37,020
department and maybe they'll figure it out. Oops. All right. I'm done. All right. That's it. That's

1654
06:45:37,020 --> 06:45:39,740
it. I'm not going to search around. I'm done. We'll come back tomorrow.

1655
06:45:39,740 --> 06:45:51,020
This is the real anger time. Real anger hours. No, I'm having fun. It's just what the fuck is

1656
06:45:51,020 --> 06:45:56,299
going on here with this controller. Why are you doing this, man? Don't want to rant. All right.

1657
06:45:56,299 --> 06:46:03,500
I'll tell you. Let me tell you something about fucking Xbox. No. We'll go tomorrow. We'll go

1658
06:46:03,500 --> 06:46:08,200
tomorrow. Let me get like a new controller because here's what's going to happen. I'm telling you.

1659
06:46:08,840 --> 06:46:13,560
I am going to get to where I was with the keyboard and mouse and I'm not going to get the control

1660
06:46:13,560 --> 06:46:17,799
right and I'm going to like right click when I should have hit Q and it's going to be the make

1661
06:46:17,799 --> 06:46:21,319
or break the rest of the stream and I'm going to be very bad and I'm going to go back and I'm going

1662
06:46:21,319 --> 06:46:26,919
to talk about Microsoft again. I'm going to go on a huge rant about how I should have had the

1663
06:46:26,919 --> 06:46:38,139
controller and if I had a controller it's fucking stupid. We'll start tomorrow. Just rewind to

1664
06:46:38,139 --> 06:46:51,619
right click. That's so close. Damn it. Whatever. It's all good. We want a rant. No, it's all good.

1665
06:46:51,619 --> 06:46:56,150
It's all good. We're good. I'll see you guys tomorrow. We're going to finish this game

1666
06:46:56,150 --> 06:47:06,900
and hopefully by then I will have a controller that doesn't just disconnect for no reason.

1667
06:47:06,900 --> 06:47:12,900
No funny zoo game? Um, no, not until this is done and maybe not again. I don't know. We'll see.

1668
06:47:14,360 --> 06:47:21,750
We're just playing at zoo. I just played it yesterday. No, no, no, not. I don't know. We'll

1669
06:47:21,750 --> 06:47:26,139
find out. We're going to be stuck on the boss for the whole next stream. No, we won't

1670
06:47:27,319 --> 06:47:32,360
because I'm going to look up how to beat it by incredibly cheeseball dog shit strategy.

1671
06:47:33,299 --> 06:47:40,470
I'm just going to type in motorcycle lady cheeseball strategy and just look it up.

1672
06:47:40,470 --> 06:47:48,729
Whatever. Who cares? And we'll see what happens tomorrow. I had a lot of fun with this game,

1673
06:47:48,729 --> 06:47:51,930
though, besides the random like three or four times where I was just like,

1674
06:47:54,330 --> 06:48:03,959
so it's been fun. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Same time, same place. Did you hear the dog?

1675
06:48:03,959 --> 06:48:18,819
I think he's yelled at me. That was Dead Rising part run, guitar part run. Actually,

1676
06:48:18,819 --> 06:48:33,049
that was what I was doing the whole time. Let's do the bits. You know, sometimes I just check to

1677
06:48:33,049 --> 06:48:43,240
see if this works, but it doesn't. That's all right. That's going to be the YouTube title.

1678
06:48:43,959 --> 06:48:53,159
All right. So seven hours ago here we had a dog. Oh, good boy. Thanks to the 500 bits. Are you

1679
06:48:53,159 --> 06:48:58,979
going to attempt the seven day survival challenge after you beat the game? Uh, I don't even know

1680
06:48:58,979 --> 06:49:11,779
what that is. We'll have to see, uh, after what happens tomorrow. Thank you. The 500 bits judging

1681
06:49:11,779 --> 06:49:16,659
by how well I am able to manage, uh, most of the survivors. I don't think that's going to happen.

1682
06:49:16,659 --> 06:49:23,430
What is that? If you die once, you just, it's over. It's like hardcore mode. That would be so

1683
06:49:23,430 --> 06:49:30,630
horrible. Seven days is like hard mode. Yeah. Don't you have an appointment tomorrow? No,

1684
06:49:30,630 --> 06:49:36,700
I had it wrong. It's the next day. So we're streaming tomorrow. Sticks renegade. Thanks

1685
06:49:36,700 --> 06:49:42,380
for the 250. If memory serves me right, the best weapon is the mannequin torso. I remembered it.

1686
06:49:42,380 --> 06:49:52,459
One shot most zombies in this good durability. That's a good tip. I'll take it. It's seven real

1687
06:49:52,459 --> 06:50:09,000
days. A long time. It's a very long time. Uh, I'll try it out. I'll try it tomorrow.

1688
06:50:09,639 --> 06:50:13,349
Rock Esper. Thanks for the 250. Hey, Jeremy, you never talk about this sort of stuff.

1689
06:50:13,349 --> 06:50:20,389
The character, Jesse, the blonde girl. Do you find her attractive? Just say yes or no. I paid money

1690
06:50:20,389 --> 06:50:35,740
for this. I don't even know. I don't even remember what the hell that was. I have no idea. Is it a

1691
06:50:35,740 --> 06:50:49,459
character in this game? There's a lot of people that I've come across. All right. Good answer.

1692
06:50:50,099 --> 06:50:53,659
Okay. It's the only answer because I really don't even know who they're talking about.

1693
06:50:56,759 --> 06:51:00,680
But thank you for the 250. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bobo Durango for the 300 bits.

1694
06:51:01,240 --> 06:51:05,479
Jeremy, there's a secret Katana sword weapon on the awning. If you jump off the second floor,

1695
06:51:05,479 --> 06:51:11,319
food court real. Right. I look, okay. I know that there's like secret weapons and items.

1696
06:51:12,650 --> 06:51:19,270
I don't know. That's there. I have no idea. Jump off into the awning and grab the Katana.

1697
06:51:19,830 --> 06:51:26,380
That's meta gaming. He told you. Well, now I know it's there and that's cheating, but it's

1698
06:51:26,380 --> 06:51:32,459
okay. We're cheating now because I don't care. Tell me everything. Tell me where the bazooka is

1699
06:51:32,459 --> 06:51:52,099
so I can stuff it into that fucking girl on the bike's face. GTA hacker. But yeah, I'll start

1700
06:51:52,099 --> 06:52:04,860
picking it up. Thank you too. Kimono friend zone. Thanks for the 1500 bits. 15 bucks.

1701
06:52:05,580 --> 06:52:09,060
Jeremy, not even kidding. The mannequin torso is the most powerful weapon in the game.

1702
06:52:09,860 --> 06:52:23,610
He's like, I was like angry with me right now. Why? He just like, Hey, what is he doing? He's

1703
06:52:23,610 --> 06:52:27,990
like, let me out. Let me out. Where he's going. Let me see what he's doing. Let me just see what

1704
06:53:07,560 --> 06:53:16,229
my door going like, Hey, he's eating. He's been outside and now he's just hanging on. Okay. Well,

1705
06:53:16,310 --> 06:53:25,180
see what you want in just a few minutes. He talks. Yeah, but I'll try the mannequin torso tomorrow.

1706
06:53:25,180 --> 06:53:35,590
Maybe I can even kill her with a mannequin torso. Thank you. Dark soul for the 250. I feel like I

1707
06:53:35,590 --> 06:53:39,990
should leave a serious one. Thanks for all the streams and I hope you don't take our memes too

1708
06:53:39,990 --> 06:53:45,110
seriously. Don't worry. I do not. We only tease because we love our streamer. Jerma Hart also

1709
06:53:45,110 --> 06:53:49,669
chat. There's a burner cell phone taped underneath your chair. Go to the basement of Caesar's palace

1710
06:53:49,669 --> 06:54:05,610
and call the number. Jerma isn't who he says he is. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for the 250. Appreciate

1711
06:54:05,610 --> 06:54:12,939
it. Thank you. Al 2653 for the thousand bits. Jerma, let me give you a couple of basic tips

1712
06:54:12,939 --> 06:54:17,029
for the game. Always keep a couple of healing items on you. Arrange weapon and a couple of

1713
06:54:17,029 --> 06:54:21,830
good melee weapons at all times. Keep it out for save points too. Save anytime you enter a new area,

1714
06:54:21,830 --> 06:54:26,069
baby. And ultimately keep an eye on your main quest religiously. Keep it up, man. We all love

1715
06:54:26,069 --> 06:54:33,099
you. Even when you get, we get angry too. I mean, I was told that dead rising is an angry game.

1716
06:54:33,099 --> 06:54:39,509
Before I played dead rising, somebody told me, Hey, the bosses in that game are dog shit.

1717
06:54:40,229 --> 06:54:44,900
I was like, we talking about what? Yeah. You're going to get really annoyed with them.

1718
06:54:44,900 --> 06:54:59,450
I'm like, no, I'm dead rising. This is me in the mirror, by the way. Somebody, somebody just,

1719
06:54:59,450 --> 06:55:05,610
somebody just said that like 40 minutes ago. And then because somebody said it in chat, it was like,

1720
06:55:06,709 --> 06:55:07,669
I can say it now too.

1721
06:55:10,790 --> 06:55:14,340
I really like dead rising, but like the boss is really like fucking like dumb.

1722
06:55:15,139 --> 06:55:19,159
The boss is like dumb. The boss is a dumb. I didn't say it. The boss is a dumb.

1723
06:55:19,159 --> 06:55:25,610
And then I'd say people like, what are you talking about? Oh, somebody said that. Like somebody said

1724
06:55:25,610 --> 06:55:38,939
that in chat. I'm just like, I, yeah, that's, you think that too? Local comedians stealing

1725
06:55:38,939 --> 06:55:47,270
joke from the audience. I was saying that a boss is dumb, a joke. I'm not going to get on

1726
06:55:47,270 --> 06:55:57,159
Johnny Carson with that one guys. I never said it was funny. That's true. You know, you're right.

1727
06:56:03,880 --> 06:56:06,680
All right. Colusia. Thanks for the 250. Hey, let's put the credits up too.

1728
06:56:12,380 --> 06:56:15,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1729
06:56:15,500 --> 06:56:24,040
Colusia. Thanks for the 250. Hey, what's up? It's my birthday this Friday. So here's some

1730
06:56:24,040 --> 06:56:29,000
pre-birthday money. Also, do you think you could say my name Mia so I can edit it into the rat's

1731
06:56:29,000 --> 06:56:33,560
birthday mix tape? Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Jerma. Much love. You don't even need to edit it.

1732
06:56:34,279 --> 06:56:40,919
Happy birthday, Mia. Mia. It's your birthday today. Ice cream and shit is on the way.

1733
06:56:44,060 --> 06:56:58,979
Use that. Thanks everybody for your subs. You continued subscriptions. It's sorry. I just like

1734
06:56:58,979 --> 06:57:04,819
fucking completely blanked. I'm looking at my phone. I just like thanks for the subs and

1735
06:57:05,459 --> 06:57:13,080
what I said. Like I had a notification on my phone and my brain turned off. Okay, we're back.

1736
06:57:13,080 --> 06:57:18,150
No sirs. Thanks everybody for the subs and your extraordinary support of the channel.

1737
06:57:18,950 --> 06:57:24,330
It means a lot. He would rather look at his phone. No, no, no. I just it was like a like the

1738
06:57:24,330 --> 06:57:30,860
my light on my phone lit up and I have like the brain of a fucking squirrel or something

1739
06:57:30,860 --> 06:57:42,500
like a rat phone. Yeah, because I don't have notifications to sound on during a stream.

1740
06:57:43,220 --> 06:57:59,540
Otherwise, he would just be like, you guys don't want to hear that. But happy birthday to Mia.

1741
06:57:59,540 --> 06:58:04,259
Thank you. Sad Vega. Thanks for the 250. If there is ever a zombie apocalypse, you don't get to be

1742
06:58:04,259 --> 06:58:11,479
the leader. Yeah, people were like giving me shit about you'd be so bad. There's all the

1743
06:58:11,479 --> 06:58:16,860
apocalypse. You don't know where you are. Like as if I'm just blindfolded walking around my house.

1744
06:58:22,700 --> 06:58:27,900
You know, I don't need to know where I am. I just need to move my arms up and down left and right

1745
06:58:27,900 --> 06:58:38,950
real fast, really hard with a sword. I can do that really well. And a shitload of canned food.

1746
06:58:45,450 --> 06:58:53,000
Oh, okay. So I'm apparently doing it wrong. I'm just gonna have a go kart that's full

1747
06:58:53,560 --> 06:59:02,419
with like a train of wagons behind me that all has canned food in it. That's all gonna be covered

1748
06:59:02,419 --> 06:59:16,860
up. So nobody knows what it is. He's gonna starve within 24 hours. That face when you got to kill

1749
06:59:16,860 --> 06:59:47,590
zombie germ of Pepe hands. No, I am returning. It's not gonna happen. I'm too sneaky. But thank you.

1750
06:59:47,590 --> 06:59:53,830
Sad Vega. Gnarly. Thanks for the 250. Ever gonna do another system games collection stream like

1751
06:59:53,830 --> 06:59:58,060
you did with the dreamcast and PlayStation might be something might be fun with something like the

1752
06:59:58,060 --> 07:00:12,009
GameCube or DS. Um, not in the immediate future. I mean, the GameCube is really cool. But I would

1753
07:00:12,009 --> 07:00:24,779
need to, you know, I at one point, I was thinking about I wanted to do an Atari stream. Just get all

1754
07:00:24,779 --> 07:00:29,340
the old old Atari games and play them all. There's many as I could. And over the course of a day or

1755
07:00:29,340 --> 07:00:34,299
two, that stream would probably get really boring though, because every Atari game is almost the

1756
07:00:34,299 --> 07:00:45,080
same game. So after like 25 Atari games, it'd probably be like, okay, there's only so many

1757
07:00:45,080 --> 07:00:57,029
stick figure jumps across the lake that we can do in a row. But I think about it sometimes.

1758
07:01:00,220 --> 07:01:11,779
I guess the the progression PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Dreamcast, GameCube,

1759
07:01:11,779 --> 07:01:20,060
Nintendo 64. There's a lot of them. Are you ever gonna play code vein? I forgot about that. I bought

1760
07:01:20,060 --> 07:01:35,349
it to to stream it. I don't know. You said you were gonna play it. Yeah, I know. Well, I said I

1761
07:01:35,349 --> 07:01:43,130
wanted to. And then I put a vote up, I think. And like 12% of people clicked on code vein. It was

1762
07:01:43,130 --> 07:01:59,900
like, at least make a dumb character in it. That's because we had the thing. That's true.

1763
07:02:01,270 --> 07:02:05,590
Maybe I'll revisit it soon. I don't know. I can't get I don't want to get everybody's hopes up and

1764
07:02:05,590 --> 07:02:15,779
just be like, yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't really have a plan. But hey, errorless. Thanks

1765
07:02:15,779 --> 07:02:23,959
for the 250. Jerma Saturn. Cool. So underused emote, I think. Dr. Clay, thanks for the 250.

1766
07:02:23,959 --> 07:02:34,169
I haven't even I haven't seen you get that mad since Hotline Miami. When? Wait, what this what

1767
07:02:34,169 --> 07:02:45,380
just happened? When did when did I get mad? I mean, during the motorcycle part? Oh, absolutely.

1768
07:02:46,020 --> 07:02:51,779
This was that was seven minutes ago. So angry. Somebody already has a clip of this.

1769
07:02:52,740 --> 07:02:56,979
Yeah, I mean, well, come on. Like I'm getting like turned on a dime with a lady on a motorcycle.

1770
07:02:57,779 --> 07:03:05,860
That's like that's that's bullshit. She's driving through debris like it's nothing.

1771
07:03:13,560 --> 07:03:19,319
Stupid like NPC shitheads. Get away from me. Get out of here. This is three. Oh,

1772
07:03:19,319 --> 07:03:33,900
I am so angry right now. You have no idea. This is a stupid. Oh, I cooled off right there. That's

1773
07:03:33,979 --> 07:03:50,779
fine. It was a little bit. That's not Hotline Miami tear anger. It is not. Not. No, no, no. I

1774
07:03:50,779 --> 07:03:57,430
can tell you as the guy sitting in the chair, not even close. Not even close. Oh, Hotline Miami. I

1775
07:03:57,430 --> 07:04:04,779
was just I hated it. I like hated it. There was like three levels in a row there. I was just like,

1776
07:04:04,779 --> 07:04:14,180
oh, it was inconsolable. I hated that. He hates it. Hotline Miami. No, it was Hotline Miami 2.

1777
07:04:14,659 --> 07:04:22,279
That's probably the most upset I've ever been on stream like recorded. Hotline Miami 1. I don't

1778
07:04:22,279 --> 07:04:31,209
think I had a problem with it. It was two. Yeah. So if you got a level between like Hotline Miami 2

1779
07:04:31,209 --> 07:04:39,099
is up at the top and drinking while playing Nintendo Labo is at the bottom. That was probably

1780
07:04:39,099 --> 07:04:50,299
somewhere into like the thing stream number two when I was walking around that corridor for like

1781
07:04:50,299 --> 07:05:04,889
20 minutes. That's like maybe like two or three rungs below Hotline Miami 2. But that didn't even

1782
07:05:04,889 --> 07:05:12,099
last that long. And no, no, no. Yeah, that that clip right there was like the extent of me being

1783
07:05:12,099 --> 07:05:16,470
upset with Dead Rising. I was like, no, I was mad at the controller because my controller kept

1784
07:05:16,470 --> 07:05:27,939
fucking going crazy. I'm out of the game. I know that's incredibly that's a meme. I was mad at the

1785
07:05:27,939 --> 07:05:33,419
controller. My controller is fucked up. My controller is broken. It was. I didn't do it.

1786
07:05:33,419 --> 07:05:39,369
I didn't even need to prove that. Imagine if I was just unplugging it on purpose over and over

1787
07:05:39,369 --> 07:05:54,659
again and like pretending to be angry with it. That would be such a pain in the ass. That would

1788
07:05:54,659 --> 07:06:04,650
be a pain in the ass. But imagine now I said it and now it's in people's heads and you can never

1789
07:06:04,650 --> 07:06:09,930
take it back. Anyways, thank you to DrSteam for the 500 vids. Jerma, are you going to participate

1790
07:06:09,930 --> 07:06:18,220
in the big Minecraft streamer only event that takes place on a huge world map? No. Do you even

1791
07:06:18,220 --> 07:06:29,500
know about it? I do not and I probably I'm not going to be participating. Yo, that sounds pog.

1792
07:06:30,060 --> 07:06:44,169
I mean, that sounds pretty cool. We already signed you up. That's not how this works. You

1793
07:06:44,889 --> 07:06:52,599
you guys aren't like my parents making sure I do some extracurricular activities. So you

1794
07:06:52,599 --> 07:07:07,099
signed me up for like the French horn. That's not how this works. We said you would host it.

1795
07:07:07,099 --> 07:07:16,759
Oh wow, that would be ridiculous. No. Okay, I need to stop talking because let me be very clear

1796
07:07:16,759 --> 07:07:24,650
here. I am not going to participate in that event. I wish him luck. Sounds cool. I will not be

1797
07:07:24,650 --> 07:07:36,970
participating. There you go. Hey James aka Bath Bomb Boy. Thanks for the 250. Hey Jerma, MrBathBomb

1798
07:07:36,970 --> 07:07:48,439
here again. Changed your name. That was not the name before, was it? Hey Jerma, MrBathBomb here

1799
07:07:48,439 --> 07:07:57,669
again. I feel like it was a different name. I work at Lush making bath bombs. Well anyways,

1800
07:07:57,669 --> 07:08:04,389
most of the people are especially so when especially what is it? What English is two English

1801
07:08:04,389 --> 07:08:11,110
people are speaking English. What is it? What are you talking about? There are two. Most of the people

1802
07:08:11,110 --> 07:08:23,299
are ESL. Oh okay. You should have a career day stream where us fans can show you our unique jobs.

1803
07:08:23,380 --> 07:08:30,759
Well I'd love to chat more but it's uh but it but at his point it's cheaper to talk to a

1804
07:08:30,759 --> 07:08:38,810
sex hotline instead of giving you bits. All right BF Bugleberry could use a bath bomb. What the

1805
07:08:38,810 --> 07:08:57,509
fuck is going on here? BF Bugleberry could use a bath bomb. What are these comments? I mean I kind

1806
07:08:57,509 --> 07:09:03,049
of get the gist of it. Have a career day though? That's that would be like interesting I guess.

1807
07:09:03,049 --> 07:09:12,040
Oh what oh I didn't put up no turn that no no this one is worth it. Errorless at the final bit.

1808
07:09:12,520 --> 07:09:15,959
Thanks for the 250 and take care everybody. That's the final one you're right.

1809
07:09:17,560 --> 07:09:21,479
All right guys I'll see you tomorrow for the conclusion the second half of Dead Rising 1.

1810
07:09:25,720 --> 07:09:38,700
Thank you. See you soon. Have a great rest of your night. Join us tomorrow. I'll have a new

1811
07:09:38,700 --> 07:09:44,650
controller by then and I will be locked in and push that fucking lady off her bike.

1812
07:09:45,290 --> 07:09:57,319
You got it. Take care have a great night. A grace night. A great night. I could probably use

1813
07:09:58,119 --> 07:10:06,360
some peanut butter or something. Good night. See you tomorrow. I just have a cat falling out of

1814
07:10:06,360 --> 07:10:16,619
this tree. That has not left me in almost two days. All right good night. Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

1815
07:10:16,619 --> 07:10:17,500
Take care.
