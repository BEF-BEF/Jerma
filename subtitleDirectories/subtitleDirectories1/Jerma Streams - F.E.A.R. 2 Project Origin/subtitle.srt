1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,679
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the fuck is this? I have predict- people can predict stuff?

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,039
What is this? What- I didn't- when did this get activated? Did this just get activated like a

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:17,100
minute ago? I didn't even know I had this. What? Don't spend all your channel points on coin tosses.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,629
When did this come through? 1.8 million. Who- you guys doing millions of dollars?

5
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:30,940
You've been betting for an hour. Wait, stop. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

6
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,420
I- I- I don't- but I don't- the thing is I don't understand. How much are you gonna lose on a coin

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,259
toss? I don't know. I- I- I turned the stream on. I pressed start streaming and I saw that.

8
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:49,450
1.8 versus 2.3. Well, what the fuck is it gonna be? I- hold on. I go to my details. Introducing

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,850
channel points. Watch Terma 985. Wait a minute. I gotta go in my settings for a second. Holy shit.

10
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:05,049
You guys saying tails? I got- it's just gonna be coin tosses all day.

11
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,849
Prediction results is heads. Oh, but you guys- half you guys lost like two million dollars.

12
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,870
Holy shit. Hold on a minute. I- wait, give me a second while I figure this out.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:26,709
What? Panel points. Hold on. Manage rewards. Smart costs for- no. Where is it?

14
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:36,060
Community challenges. Where's predictions? How do I do this? 4.1 million goes to sticky brick.

15
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:45,019
Wait, what? Why did one person win? Why- is this like Mario Party? Did he get it first? Did he come

16
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:51,159
in first place and when you come in fourth place or over you get like two coins? I don't understand.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,359
All right, I don't even know how to turn this on or off. It's just gonna- it's just gonna have

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,519
to be like this, I think, for a while. Turn it off. I don't even know how to turn it on.

19
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:11,509
Okay, community challenges. Default rewards. Keep it on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. How to play.

20
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:20,580
Details. Point toss. Predictions. Manage rewards. Here we go. Okay, enable channel points.

21
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:28,039
I don't- there's no way to do anything. I can't- I don't think I can even turn it off. Manage

22
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:32,520
rewards and challenges. Customize points. Enable channel points. I don't have like a predictions

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:46,620
tab. Custom rewards. Default rewards. Community challenge. I can't even turn this off. Okay,

24
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,159
anyways. Hi guys, how you doing? It's tails and heads forever. That's the- welcome to the stream.

25
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:00,460
I lost 120k thousand channel- don't stop gambling until I- don't use this until I get something in

26
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,520
here. I want to- this is the oh shit game. This is oh shit game 2. Dermasucks just gave 20 community

27
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,490
subs. This took me way off guard. I was not prepared for this. Is there a place I can change this

28
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:27,909
stuff? I don't think I can. What about if I go here? Review recent raids. No, what? I can like

29
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:36,860
see who raided me? I didn't know you could do that. It's slash predictions. Slash predictions.

30
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:45,370
Flash predictions. Unrecognized command. That didn't do anything.

31
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,629
Why do people keep looking at so many subs right now? That was 20 community subs from

32
00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:01,240
Dermasucks and then 10 from Zurkda. Right in the browser. Oh, hold on. Good call. Sorry,

33
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,840
this is throwing off the whole beginning of the stream, but like I- I did not even know I had this

34
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,080
until- I didn't even know what it was. I'm looking at heads and tails. I'm like,

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,099
what the fuck are they doing? Okay, let me see if I can do it in the browser.

36
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:25,740
It's brand new. Yeah. How do I- I don't have a pro- prediction result is heads.

37
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:35,139
Wait, hold on. What the fuck, dude? I didn't even- don't lose all your money already.

38
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,100
Once- open a setup menu to create and manage predictions. Thank you. All right, let's go.

39
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:50,649
Okay. Manage predictions. Coin toss. Okay, start a prediction. Oh shit. All right, here we go.

40
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:57,879
Boys and girls, here we go. Um, how about this one? Possible outcome. I- I wish I knew I had this.

41
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,000
This is- uh, all right. This is gonna take me a little while. I have to set some stuff up for

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,439
this. Who wins? Derma Mars or Derma Merc? It's five minute period. What do you mean who wins?

43
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:28,259
Who wins? Okay, I'm gonna do who wins. Derma Mars or Derma Merc. Start prediction.

44
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,980
You or a mod will need to confirm the outcome within 24 hours at the end of the prediction

45
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,699
submissions. Once you start a prediction, you cannot change it except to delete it or close

46
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,939
submissions. If an outcome isn't selected or the prediction is deleted, all channel points will be

47
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:55,189
returned to participating viewers. Okay. Um, who wins? Derma Merc or Derma Mars? I don't even know

48
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:14,660
what that means. Who wins? But wins what? Do I have to decide who wins? Holy shit, Derma Mars is-

49
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:24,170
apparently you guys think Derma Mars is gonna win. But what are they- are they fighting? I have to

50
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:37,819
pick. What? No, I can't pick this. 6.4 million versus 2.1 million. Do I actually have this in

51
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:42,779
time to set this up for the rumble on New Year's Eve? Oh my god. All right, don't blow all your money.

52
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:49,500
Turn this off. Don't you- don't- nobody do this. All right, I'm gonna send channel points back. How

53
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:57,639
do I do that? It's too late? Oh, it's not too late. Cancel it. How do I cancel it? Cancel. Cancel. How

54
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:05,189
do I cancel this one? Did I do it? Did I cancel? How do I cancel it? You got rid of it?

55
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,810
Oh, all right. Good, good, good, good. Okay. So, wait, who is starting predictions then?

56
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,970
Is it mods? Are the mods just trying to get you guys to lose money? Wait, did everyone get scammed?

57
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:24,199
You should have got it back. Okay, so the mo- all right, so for a second I thought that you guys

58
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,519
were activating the coin toss. All right, you got it back. Good. All right, hold off on this.

59
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,639
We'll- I want to get some stuff done for this because now that I know I have it, I can't wait

60
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,720
to use it. I want- I've wanted a system like this for a long goddamn time and now it's here.

61
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,430
Just some normal guy, thanks to the five subs. Thanks to the five community subs.

62
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:51,269
What about all the coin tosses I lost? Yeah, sorry. You can't go into- you can't go into

63
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:57,110
a Vegas casino. Go play roulette for an hour. Lose a bunch of money and say, hey, I want a refund.

64
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:06,970
I didn't have- I want my money back. That wasn't fun. They don't give you a receipt

65
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,639
every time you make a bet at a Vegas table. Yes, I'll take five dollars on Blackjack, please. And

66
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,470
they're like- like print you out a big CVS receipt. Sir, you've busted. Oh, I didn't like

67
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,550
the outcome of that. I'd like to have Red Jack return that hand. Okay, yeah, hold on. Let's

68
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,509
process that. They have to take it to the back and somebody says a manager has to sign it and you

69
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:39,820
get a five dollar bill back. No, no, that would be impossible to play. All right, let's go. Today

70
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,059
we're gonna play Fear 2 and I've got some things to tell you. I've got a little thing to talk about.

71
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:53,419
Let's talk about some things. All right, listen. Listen up. So, I am going to- here we go. Take a

72
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:58,139
break, Andy. Here he comes. He's gonna say it. Going on break, Andy. Here he comes. Delay, Andy.

73
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:05,500
Delay stream, Andy. Okay, so we're gonna play Fear tonight. I'm gonna try to stream very early

74
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,429
tomorrow. I'm gonna try to get a good stream in tomorrow as well. I have a lot of things to take

75
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:16,309
care of. I've got a lot of things to do. I've got a lot of holiday stuff to do. I am going to be

76
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:22,470
disappearing for a week. I'm not gonna be around. Well, I'm gonna be working on stuff and doing

77
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:31,379
things and doing holiday things and- because the New Year's Eve stream is both a rumble and

78
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:37,620
the award show and I want to make sure I get that situated too. So, I'll be on break. Break, Andy.

79
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,860
Here he comes. Talking about going on like an eight or nine day break after tomorrow. So, with

80
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,379
that being said, I'm going to- tonight's gonna be a meaty one. Okay, we're gonna- I'm gonna be here

81
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:56,539
for- I'm not- this is not gonna be a four hour stream. I'll be- I can say- I'll be here for a

82
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:01,019
longer than that. I'll be here for- I'm not gonna be here for four hours. This is gonna be a little

83
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,879
longer. It's gonna be five hours. Fucking pug jam. You hear that one? That's right. Five hour stream

84
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:15,289
tonight. Can you believe it? But I will be back to get the festivities going for the end of the

85
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:23,210
year. But yeah, let's go. I- sorry that it's been 10 minutes to get started here. Year two is coming

86
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,360
up. I'm so glad I have that channel points thing though. It makes things so much more interesting.

87
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,590
It's not just like spend 1200 channel points to give an emote a mustache. Like this is- this is

88
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:49,960
real stakes now. Okay, let me- let me get started. Good link. They added a billion to the debt

89
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:57,460
counter. Why? For the impossible quiz and that's incorrect. I love how we have debt auditors that

90
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:04,149
are on the case. No, no, no. Excuse me. I've been- I've been an auditor. I've been looking at this.

91
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,500
All right, let me get the game open. Fear 2. Never played this before.

92
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Let's get started. New deal. Hold on. Okay, Otto's Adventure is outdated. Let's put this on stream.

93
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:39,879
Let's find out what you guys want. Let me see here. Okay, Otto's Adventure is outdated. Yeah?

94
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,000
Otto's Big Adventure, A Dog's Day Out, full movie.

95
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,659
Eight years ago, okay. Remake it for 2.5 billion off the debt. Otto's Pogtastic Adventure,

96
00:11:51,659 --> 00:12:06,980
A Dog's Day Out, remastered. Okay, deal. I agree. Deal. You got a deal. I will do a remastered

97
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:17,240
Otto's Pog Adventure. You ever gonna continue Hades? You quit at like the beginning of the game.

98
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,799
It'd be like quitting Binding of Isaac after four floors.

99
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:32,149
All right. Listen, I know. I've got a lot of things going on at the moment. It's a- I love

100
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,759
that game. It's a game of the year. Yes, I got four floors down in Binding of Isaac and said it was

101
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:44,120
the game of the year. Yes, but it's true. You know that. I know it. Everybody knows it. It has to go

102
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,740
on the main channel. Oh, you're gonna have to sweeten the deal there. No, no, I don't think

103
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,190
you can. I don't know about that. I don't know about that. That's gonna have to be much more.

104
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:03,450
To put that- to have that be the last upload on my main channel. You know how many people are gonna

105
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,009
just forget that I existed? That's gonna show up in their sub box and they're gonna think that I'm

106
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:16,139
on drugs and like I've gone like just over the edge. Like, oh, it's been like- it's been like

107
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,220
four and a half years since a German 95 upload. Oh, I remember this guy. It's Otto's Pogtastic

108
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:33,129
Adventure. I don't know about that. I feel like this is five billion- no, it's gotta be higher

109
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:48,309
than that. Higher than that. Ten- what is- okay, what's the debt at right now? Three billion if

110
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:55,450
you use that thumbnail. Is it at fifty? Did you- no, I thought I thought I got- we need some

111
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,019
auditors to take a look at this. Oh, yes, I'm interested. I'll do it. We gotta get the right

112
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:05,960
price though. Let's play Fear. Fear 2, actually. Sorry about that. Let me get that correct.

113
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:14,009
You guys will figure it out. You guys will figure it out. It'll- you guys- I have confidence you

114
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:25,210
guys will know what you're doing. Camera's not on, right? Okay, just making sure. Is this Fear? No,

115
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:35,720
don't do any coin tosses. Don't- do not humor them. Okay, so, all right, give me one- give me one

116
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,200
second. I just want to grab- I want to grab- hold on. I gotta grab something. I gotta- hold on. I'll be

117
00:14:40,200 --> 00:16:01,509
right back. I'm gonna sprint. Right back. And make sure you get in your- no, just getting nominations

118
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:07,769
are closed. Sorry. You had your chance. Uh, the voting for the New Year's Eve Awards, by the way,

119
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:17,990
will be up pretty soon. So, you're- the actual voting will be available probably by the end of

120
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:24,059
this weekend or by Monday, I would say. Somewhere around Monday. You need to do a face cam. I don't

121
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:29,769
have any clothes on. Okay, I promise if I get jump scared once, I will turn on a face cam. It's not

122
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:35,289
gonna happen. This is not a scary game. I'm not gonna get scared by this game because this game

123
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:44,299
came out back when Little Girl is Scary was huge. And holy shit, if a little girl is, like, on camera

124
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,840
and she's standing at the end of a hallway, she's fucking terrifying. That doesn't scare

125
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:59,059
me anymore. I've seen it a hundred times. Back in, like, 2008, 2007, whatever it was.

126
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:04,500
Why are you naked? I'm not naked. I just don't have clothes on. You can be- you can- you can have

127
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,859
clothes on and be naked. And you can have- not have clothes on and not be naked. I don't even know

128
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,009
what I'm saying. I put my headphones in and music started playing and I just- I got speech jammed.

129
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:19,589
All right, let's go. I got so sorry. I got speech jammed when I put on the headphones.

130
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,089
Let's-

131
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,079
Okay, let's go. Single player online play doesn't exist anymore. There's no way it does.

132
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:44,779
All right, campaign. Fear 2. Reborn. I don't know. It's doing normal difficulty. What's hard

133
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:53,640
or easy? It's three. This is halfway there. God almighty, he's so high. I'm not high. I'm on hard.

134
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm not putting on hard. I don't do hard anymore. Back in, like, 2012, I would have put it on hard.

135
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Not now. 35-year-old Jeremy does not play games on hard. He plays games for the story and for,

136
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,450
the comedic material. I don't play games to look cool and be good. I play games to laugh at people

137
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:22,650
like getting hit by a car. I don't care anymore. I'm playing on normal. You've been diverted from

138
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,099
an assignment to assist- I'm still good at games, by the way. You've seen me play recently. I'm still

139
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:32,519
cool. And I know that any time you have to say that you're still cool, it means you're not cool

140
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:42,009
anymore, but I know I still am. All right, Svod- Svod D. Mission in the Auburn Industrial District.

141
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:50,309
Your new orders are to proceed to the private residence of Genevieve Orestide of Aracham

142
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:55,430
Technology Corporation and take her into protective custody. She will instruct you

143
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:03,059
where to escort her. Is this a 90 FOV? I hope so. I didn't download any community mod patches

144
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:28,980
or anything. Is this a 90 FOV? Why is this so low? Volume? It's 65? No, it's not. I remember

145
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:42,710
optimizing my fear 2 experience. Uh oh. You need to optimize it? All right, fear 2.

146
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:52,980
What? What the heck, man? Scared. Oh my god. Little girl with a teddy bear. She must be scary.

147
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,059
Little girl with a teddy bear. There may have been some blood on the teddy bear. That

148
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:06,630
might be scary to me. This is dark. Hold on. Right off the bat, I already see a problem. Just

149
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:16,150
give me a second. Yeah, that's got to go down. All right, how about FOV? Video settings. You

150
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,470
know you're in trouble when the only video settings in game are brightness and a resolution. Okay,

151
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:33,779
what about um whatever. You should invert the aim. I want to name scary. Mac in 2012. That

152
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:43,480
was terrifying. That's still too high though. Hold on. It's got to go to like zero. Okay,

153
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:58,759
that scared me. Where did I go? All right, let's go. How does this still feel like too high of a

154
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:16,410
mouse sensitivity? Go in and not only that, but there's like scary music box music.

155
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,579
Got me. It got me. I gotta turn the cam on.

156
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,839
No, that didn't even get me. That didn't get me. It wasn't even that that got me. It was the fact

157
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:36,519
that I was looking at the music box and I sat down weird on my chair. There was a glass on it and it

158
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:44,119
hurt my bump. I don't have clothes on. Hold on. I can't. Hold on. It's gonna have to be in a minute.

159
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,599
Our job is to secure this. Where are we driving? Are we driving off road? I don't want any breakage

160
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,240
even if she resists. We're bumping around like we're like the tower of terror. She's directly

161
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,480
linked to the bloodbath at Armicam headquarters. It's like a Universal Studios ride. It's like

162
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,319
the back to the future ride. She's a high value target and we've been tasked to bring her in.

163
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:13,240
So that's what we're going to do. Put on a seatbelt. Lighten up, Tom. She's a suit. What

164
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,880
she gonna do? Send a nasty text message? She's not the problem. Okay, for a second I thought

165
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,039
that was my finger over there pointing at them like yes, no, you talk. Now what do you have to say?

166
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,720
Fox, you're with Stokes. Keegan, you're with me. Beckett, Red,

167
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,119
Manny will drop you off in front of the building. It's a lot of people. That's us.

168
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:41,539
Shit. Why do I get into a bucket? Let's move. These guns. Okay, the guns. They're kind of

169
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:44,019
pointing them and I don't like how they're pointing the guns at each other.

170
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:48,660
Some people trigger discipline. Our mission is to find Aristine, not Cabaret.

171
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:53,539
This pop is bullshit, man. What's so important about this chick that the cops can't pick her up?

172
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,700
Yeah, I don't know. Dude, do you want to start taking hits at that fire extinguisher? Like,

173
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,500
fuck it. What's just us here? That situation is getting out of control.

174
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:10,150
Nah, dude. Not at all. All right. I'm just kidding. All right, here we go. PDA,

175
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:24,970
gun. Okay, I can't even shoot at him. Really? Okay. Access PDA. Place Genevieve

176
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,400
Aristide in protective custody. Rendezvous with your team in the building lobby.

177
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,440
Facecam. Why a shift? Aim down sights. That's not going to happen. Let's go back here for a sec.

178
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,319
Wait a minute. I got to brush my teeth. I got to brush my teeth. All right,

179
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,039
I'll put a face cam on, but I got to brush my teeth first and I got to put clothes on.

180
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,160
God fucking dammit. I didn't want to put a face cam on today. All right,

181
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,759
I'm going to brush my teeth and I'm going to put clothes on.

182
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,990
Just wait a minute. I'll be right back. Hold on. Just hear some cool art for a little while.

183
00:23:53,990 --> 00:27:39,940
Let me just brush my teeth, put some clothes on. I'll be right back.

184
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,980
All right, guys. The lawn needed a little work too, so I wasn't prepared for the stream yet.

185
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,180
I haven't cut it in like six months. I'll be live in actually a few minutes. I'll be live soon.

186
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,539
All right. Am I ready? I'm going to get this ready.

187
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,779
Fucking face cam, man. God, scary games. I lost like a thousand viewers. What am I going to do now?

188
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:13,500
No one's even going to watch me anymore. All right, relax. You'll be fine.

189
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,299
Ooh, I'm the giant rat that makes all the rules. Of course you are.

190
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:33,079
All right, what do we look like? Let's see. How are we doing today? I told you I had to put

191
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,880
clothes on. I had to get like a shirt. I had to get like, I had to brush my fucking teeth.

192
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:48,549
I had to like go like this with my hair. I had to go like, how many boogers on my hands? No,

193
00:28:48,549 --> 00:29:01,819
we're good. Nice v-neck. I own a lot of v-necks actually, so. Okay, wait a second.

194
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:16,569
Wait a second. Nice villain hair today. The thing is, I think every day is villain hair,

195
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:23,700
if I'm honest, at this point. Okay, so this is where I'm going to be sitting, like this.

196
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:37,670
Am I going like this in my mind frame? How does that look? Do I look evil? How does it look with

197
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:50,420
the game up? Am I blocking like ammo and shit? I probably am. You want to get a real close look?

198
00:29:51,299 --> 00:30:01,880
I didn't frame my nose hairs yet, never mind. I ain't getting a close look today.

199
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:24,859
Okay, I think we're good. Face cam is in the wrong spot. There, now we're good. Okay, I'm ready.

200
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:33,460
Do it blue again. I can't just turn it, okay, let's go. What would I have to do? Can't shoot him.

201
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:43,500
All right, right, right, right, right. I told you this is gonna be a long one. Key bindings.

202
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,930
Where's my chapstick? Where's my chapstick? I can't, I cannot stream without, I cannot stream

203
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:57,769
without my chapstick. I gotta have my chapstick. I don't, I don't have my, I don't have my chapstick.

204
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:12,619
I'm actually furious about that. Okay, movement. It's uh, interaction. Shift. Mouse button two is

205
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:21,990
already assigned to melee. What kind of drugs make it, no. What? This needs to be sprint.

206
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:34,569
Or sprint. Is alt? Excuse me, it's not. Sprint, shift. Shift is already assigned to zoom. Yes,

207
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:42,859
that's, no. What are you doing? I don't want it to be alt. What are you doing? All right, zoom is

208
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:59,079
mouse two. Okay, let's go. Much better. Much better. Okay, I'm ready to play the game. No melee.

209
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:10,950
Don't get too close. They'll see your nose hairs. Hey, and by the way, I just shaved too.

210
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:16,630
What do you guys think of that? This is, this is like, I just literally shaved. Shaved my face.

211
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:22,710
Clean shaven. What do you think? I'm supposed to be playing a game. Like, who cares? Who cares

212
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:42,950
if I just shaved? What am I looking for? A reload? What did I do? I already forget it. What we were

213
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:55,660
just doing? Melee. Okay. Interaction. Melee is this button. What should I do? V? Mouse button? No,

214
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,619
no, no. I want mouse button four. All right, the game doesn't even know you have mouse buttons.

215
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:11,400
Middle mouse? V. V is assigned to thermal vision. Oh my fucking god. I don't know. I'd like,

216
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:18,250
what the fuck do you put it? Alt? Alt is already assigned to sprint. No, it's not. Who has alt for

217
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:28,730
a melee? Wait, what did, what did I just do that for? Why am I, why am I sliding? Is that a slide

218
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:47,539
tackle? Whatever, let's go. Okay, so we gotta go, where are we gonna go? Place? Yeah, yeah, rendezvous.

219
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:53,740
All right, so we can't go in the front door. The sensitivity is still too high. I don't even know

220
00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:14,039
how that's possible. It's at fucking zero. This is zero sensitivity, by the way. It's zero. Go through

221
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,440
the coffee shop? All right, well, I'm trying to figure out how to get to the coffee shop, dude.

222
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,550
Turn it up all the way. It's not gonna even do anything. All right, we're going that way.

223
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,869
Eat the chapstick. Hold on, I'm too busy trying to not have my brain explode out of my front

224
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:43,139
of my eyes because I can't turn the sensitivity down. DPI is up. Yeah, I can't even change it.

225
00:34:43,139 --> 00:35:00,730
Cool. No DPI button. Yeah, the thing that I complained about so much. You guys remember when

226
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:06,780
I used to sit here and talk a ton of shit about the DPI button. I was like, Razor, holy shit,

227
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,539
remove this. This button sucks. Fuck this button and fuck you, right? I've done it probably a

228
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:38,059
thousand times. Not there anymore and I need it right now. I thought he just screamed at me.

229
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:45,179
No, I don't. You're right. The gate's locked. All right, let's go this way. Move. Wait a minute.

230
00:35:45,179 --> 00:36:08,070
The door. Oh, this door. Okay, I got a flashlight. F. Okay, there's a Vindex. I'm gonna have to

231
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:26,019
turn the DPI down. This dude's pretty strong. Holy shit. Look out. Look out. The final offer

232
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:32,699
is circulating. Okay. What happened here? How many people are on this team?

233
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:41,980
This is a, but it's been locked down. Hold on. Let me get a look. Let me look at that PC.

234
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:57,099
Okay, doctor. Making fun of a man for his knowledge is a sign of insecurity.

235
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:02,360
We need to find our seed now. Agreed. Fox, secure the lobby.

236
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,719
Ray, take the stairwell. Rest of you, you and me. The stairs?

237
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,130
What the fuck? It's a thousand fucking stories. It is a thousand fucking stories.

238
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:32,340
Just making sure he was dead. What's with my hair? I'm sorry. That was my fault.

239
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:39,480
That was all my fault. I'm sitting here going like, oh, man. How do I look? Hey,

240
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:45,719
Sergeant, what do you think? This is for a hairstyle. It's like sniped. Oh, man.

241
00:37:50,260 --> 00:38:00,710
That was all my fucking fault. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Vanity got that guy killed.

242
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:22,679
Arsenal select. Well, how far are we going? Yeah, it's pretty cool. It looks pretty good.

243
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:42,420
Oh, man. Yeah. This guy must've been shot in the aorta. I was ready for that one.

244
00:38:42,980 --> 00:39:06,949
Got that one down. One more over here. Got him. Moving up. Oh, what? Hey.

245
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:29,400
Why did that guy explode? That guy just blew up. Oh, shit. Nice. Let me do that too.

246
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:49,769
Oh, is this health? Pick up Intel. Oh, all right. Okay. I'm at the vault now.

247
00:39:51,110 --> 00:40:02,760
And plan B is going well. I don't read anything in games. All right. I thought that was a pick.

248
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:12,619
I could pick that up. This guy was using Windex as a weapon. St. Dead Rising, man.

249
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:29,980
That's not going to help you. Blue Gatorade. It's a blue Gatorade. Sprint. Is this sprint or is this

250
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:46,199
Lich Hover? Oh, she's in here. Armor vest. Nice. Okay. Bad news. You got armor. Whatever. You missed

251
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:52,260
the... Don't tell me I'm going to miss an extinguisher. Are you fucking out of your mind?

252
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, there goes fucking $40 million worth of stuff. Sorry. What's that? 50 million.

253
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,460
Hold on. I got to... Slow down. I know you think it's funny, Jeremy, but slow down.

254
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:22,280
Slow down. Hold on. It looks like I got to use my two to travel to get extra speed.

255
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:40,550
I'm in. Sorry. I'll take a 50-50. I'll take a 50-50 on that one.

256
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:57,139
Health pack. Z is med kit. Okay. Let's go ahead. That is so funny, Jeremy. I'll make me fucking

257
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:17,030
ban you. Grenades. G is grenade. Okay. What? I feel like the game's in times two speed.

258
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:27,849
Anybody else feel like that? Why does it feel like it's in fast motion? It's because it's old?

259
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:36,179
I'm a boomer. Are you sure? I feel like I'm... Am I seeing the world in slow motion?

260
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:49,349
Probably because of your DPI. I don't know. The game's going too fast. It's because you're

261
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:59,829
stoned. No, that's not it. Can I kill the helicopter? Wait, there might be a secret out here.

262
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:23,530
What was that for? It just ruined a plant. That wasn't even funny. Don't deny being stoned. I'm

263
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:37,699
not stoned. I'm drinking a coffee. And... All right. Time to come clean. Time to come clean.

264
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:44,219
All right. Okay. I'm going to be drinking out of it. I'm going to be honest with you guys

265
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:51,210
because I've got a product here. This is not an endorsement. I mean, it kind of is.

266
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:59,449
It's not a truly. I'm not drinking coffee and fucking truly. This is a streamer endorsement.

267
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:06,179
I was not paid for this. I just thought it was an interesting idea and I did it. By the way,

268
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:10,579
I want to make sure I can tell you very... I know. Listen. There's no soy in this. There ain't no

269
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:16,010
fucking soy in here. So how dare you say what I think you're going to say. It's a heel. Don't

270
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:29,030
fucking say it. There ain't no soy in this. Don't say it. There's no soy product. It's not a soy

271
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:37,110
product. It's not a soy product. I'm just trying it. I'm just trying it to see if I like it.

272
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:43,619
It's a... I can't do this without sounding like I'm fucking... All right. Listen. Sometimes streamer

273
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,960
snacks, we talked about them and I was like, all right, so like you get baby food that works.

274
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,920
That's the, you know, that gives you some fruits and vegetables and shit. I do that. I still do.

275
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,730
Beef jerky. That's a good one. This is good too for me. It's just like a bunch of calories. It's

276
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:07,159
like protein and vitamins and shit and I like it. And nobody paid me to say that. I did. I paid

277
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:13,800
myself. I transferred. I transferred. Yeah, I transferred. I transferred $600 into my account

278
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:23,510
today. Paid myself for this one. No, all jokes aside, it really is like helpful. Whenever I

279
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:29,539
told you I was trying to put on weight, that helped. So all honesty aside, that's why I started

280
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:38,119
doing it and I put on a bunch of weight. All right, let's go. You're gonna see it. I know

281
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:47,030
people are gonna see it if I took sips out of it. It's not gruel. It all went to your ass.

282
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:58,440
It was already like that even when I was losing a little bit of weight. Gamer gruel. All honesty

283
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:10,199
aside, all right, I gotta play the game. Where was I going? And there's no soy. There's no soy in

284
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:26,280
None. So all of you that want to call me that word, sorry, you can't do it. Okay, fire mode.

285
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,929
B is burst fire. Oh, that's single shot actually. Play the game, you clown. I am. Just hold on. I

286
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:40,710
had to do my fucking heal endorsement. I really was not paid to do that. I just like it. So give

287
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:57,639
it a rest. All right, forget about new fire mode. I have to turn the D. Okay, next. When I go on

288
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:08,119
break, the DPI is going to like two. This guy's unstoppable. Are they talking about me? All right,

289
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,019
headshots only. I think I can do it. Single shots. Okay, headshots only if I don't get it.

290
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:28,019
Never mind. Just play. Uh, don't I have a health kit? Isn't it Z? Oh, I guess I can. Can I just

291
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:45,539
walk in this? It's gonna be something with the debt. No, it's not. Shotgun? Sick. Grenades? Sick.

292
00:47:45,539 --> 00:48:05,500
Fuck it. That's all. Pick up what? Orcs? Oh, you can't like throw spoons at people? Shit.

293
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:26,250
Well, um, turn the fucking DPI down. How do I do that? Somebody help me. How do I turn the

294
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:41,059
DPI down on my mouse? Like mouse settings, right? Stoned off. DPI plus four. F4. Razor Synapse. I'm

295
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:44,900
not downloading that fucking pro. I will not download that program. I would rather play like

296
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:53,110
this than download that. Um, how do I do it? Do I actually have to download that? No, I don't want

297
00:48:53,110 --> 00:49:00,219
it. Term of blue. What? You need to download and fix your game. I need to download a fix for the

298
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:18,090
game. Are you serious? Don't tell me that. That's a lie, right? PC gaming wiki. Fear 2 mouse fix.

299
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,409
What is this? This makes Fear 2 use raw mouse input and removes the game's dead zone and

300
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:38,300
sensitivity problems, right? Okay. Extract this. I gotta close the game. I need to- where's the-

301
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:45,530
where's the save point here? Exit to win- just watch some artwork. I'll be right back.

302
00:49:45,530 --> 00:52:29,239
We're gonna go long today, I promise. All right, let's see if it worked. That image. That image.

303
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:38,489
The image of me existed on the internet. That I hated. It was the worst photo ever. I was like,

304
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,329
I fucking hate that photo. I wish something would take it over. Something would be more

305
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:49,659
popular than that image of my face that I don't like. And then the monkey paw curled. And that

306
00:52:49,659 --> 00:53:05,880
image has just gone crazy. And it's just- you- be careful what you wish for, as they say. So,

307
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:15,739
you know. The monkey paw, yeah. Just be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.

308
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:25,900
Indebted. Hey, banana bros! All right, let's see if this worked. Hopefully this works. I

309
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:32,860
did all the instructions. Hopefully it worked. Fix your damn game. We're going long today. Don't

310
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,789
worry. I'm here for a while. It's gonna be more than a four hour stream. Don't you guys understand?

311
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:43,159
Watch this be like a virus or something that I just downloaded and I'm an idiot.

312
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:47,579
I looked on the first link in chat and all of a sudden, like, my computer gets compromised.

313
00:53:47,579 --> 00:54:10,039
Guys, I'm in his computer. There's a ton of porn. Okay. Come on, please work. Oh, look at that!

314
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:21,019
Did it work? Guys, it worked. Everything is perfect. We're ready to go. I'm ready to play

315
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:28,920
Fear 2. Are you ready to enjoy this journey with me? I hope you are. Let's come on back now.

316
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:47,099
Oh, shit. That's fucking incredible. Look at how good I looked. Oh, Genos and Smash. I already

317
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:58,380
read it. You can't make me sad anymore. I already read it. It's never gonna happen. He's just always

318
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:06,900
gonna be like a fucking sticker for the rest of his life. Oh, whatever. Who cares? Let's go.

319
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:20,570
Getting to count Olaf here today. I kind of like it. There we go. Look at that. It's a video game

320
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:43,610
now. There we go. It's a video game now. It's a video game. I can play the video game. God damn

321
00:55:43,610 --> 00:56:02,309
it. Whatever. I was trying to do something cool, but it failed. How do I crouch? Am I dead? Whoa,

322
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:09,590
what? No deal. No deal. Deanna is forced to sing the Jerma Raid song.

323
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:26,860
What are you guys doing to her? Okay, I'm good. You forced her to sing the raid song.

324
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:36,539
What is, why are you guys doing this? Hold on. I have to watch it. I'm playing a video game. I'll

325
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:50,179
watch it in a minute. That sounded like a character. I don't know what one. That wasn't Adam Sandler.

326
00:56:50,179 --> 00:57:03,980
No. That guy was waiting for me. Do I have any grades? No, I don't want to burst fire, dude. Give

327
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:11,260
me like the, okay, there it is. You always sound like Adam Sandler. I don't think always. Maybe

328
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:22,469
sometimes. All right, let's go. I need a health pack. I don't always sound like Adam Sandler.

329
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:35,050
By the way, I'm having some trouble with this game. What does that bar mean? Better. Is that

330
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:46,440
health or what? Is red? I don't understand what it means. I don't get it. It looks red, but there's

331
00:57:46,440 --> 00:58:01,579
no, it's not decreasing. Dude, please quit touching your hair. You're making it worse.

332
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:23,559
Don't you make fun of my hair. Okay, here we go. That was an actor. That was, that was a stunt man.

333
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:39,909
He even went. All right, watch it. I'll watch it. Hold on. Let's see. You know, this is forced to

334
00:58:39,909 --> 00:59:06,679
sing the raid song. Scream overreaction. That's not her. Let's see. Literally, you're a handsome

335
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:15,420
Jack. I don't have the things here. Why am I blue? Because it's because my screen is blue.

336
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:44,409
What do you think I am? Blue? All right, here it comes. That's pretty good. That's way better

337
00:59:44,409 --> 01:00:21,000
than what I do. That came out of nowhere. Clapping my ass right now. Get that off.

338
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:35,619
Hey, you get off. Don't right now. Don't. Don't actually. I have to hide right now. I have to,

339
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:49,179
I gotta hide. I gotta turn the camera off. I gotta hide. I'm back. Fucking cooler than ever.

340
01:00:49,900 --> 01:01:14,070
I'm not blue anymore. Clapping my ass. Why is it locked? All right, it's not gonna happen to me.

341
01:01:18,710 --> 01:02:12,940
All right, does this guy just fall off by himself? Come on. He does it every time.

342
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:24,940
All right, I want more health. Are you okay? I want more health. I wonder what, okay, if I,

343
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:47,000
what happens if I like go up, hold on. I'm not gonna kill him yet. Why did it not explode? Why

344
01:02:47,000 --> 01:03:23,059
did it not explode? All right, get me in this. I have to go in this. I have to go in there, right?

345
01:03:23,059 --> 01:04:10,809
Uh-oh. Kill it. Okay, whatever. Can I swim? So what? Hidden door. Remember, you look handsome.

346
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:39,579
How about now? I don't need more. Turn the cam off now. That's a lot of people.

347
01:04:40,139 --> 01:05:11,000
Is there a grenade? I still got it. I don't care about the lore.

348
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:23,960
Little girl scary. This is the whole game. Okay, what do I, I hurt my shoulder.

349
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:53,940
There's a piano. Hold on. Piano. Why does it just turn into like a cut oak tree?

350
01:05:53,940 --> 01:06:07,130
Okay, let's go. When do I get the superpowers? Do I get, do you get superpowers in this game?

351
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:18,619
When is, oh shit. I don't, I, that's all I care about. No, you don't, you thought you looked cool,

352
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:24,659
but it was kind of cool. But you should have just held the trigger down when you heard the

353
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:38,090
footsteps in front of the door. Scary girl. Where is she? Scary girl. She's around somewhere.

354
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:47,820
Why is my instinct to just shoot her? I can't, I feel like she's going to turn around and come

355
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:55,719
try to kill me. You know what I think it is? It's me just pre-firing the jumpscare because if she

356
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:59,480
turns around and screams, I'm already, like the gun's already screaming, so I'm already ready.

357
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:52,409
All right, secret. Hold on a second. Just hurt. It was hair. It was my hair though. It was,

358
01:07:52,409 --> 01:08:00,630
it was my hair. That was my hair. That was my hair. I remember, it definitely fell in

359
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,230
because it was long and it was, it was like blonde and brown. It was this long.

360
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:29,260
That was my hair. Or it might've been, I don't know. I think it was mine. That was shot out

361
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,739
into the screen if I didn't, I wasn't careful. I was about to just start cracking up with it

362
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:37,819
in my mouth. Don't ever drink when you, don't ever do that. That's a thick liquid too. Don't

363
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:44,090
laugh while you have a thick liquid. I'm like talking, I was like, oh yeah, you, man.

364
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:52,119
I swear to God that was my hair. I know it was. Trust me. I know what it looks like. I know what

365
01:08:52,119 --> 01:09:02,390
it looks like. I just want you to know the things I like, okay? It's a product I like.

366
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:23,350
Okay, I'm going to lose my mind. I have to relax. He's malfunctioning.

367
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:27,109
You and your squad are the only hope of stopping Ulma.

368
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:51,159
No, what do you have here? It's protein. Soy. Okay. There's no soy in this. Read my fucking bottle.

369
01:09:51,159 --> 01:10:01,930
My bottle doesn't have that word. Hey, what's that say right there? Can you read it? Soy free.

370
01:10:02,729 --> 01:10:15,140
Absolutely soy free. This is probably a different product. This is a, this is

371
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:25,350
bullshit and you're a liar. You can't, you can't put one over on my eyes. I have a game to play

372
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:32,859
and I haven't done anything. It's gluten. Hey, let's, let's read it. 27 vitamins and minerals.

373
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:40,569
Fucking POG. 20 grams of plant-based protein. POG, no soy. Omega-3 and omega-6. Six grams of

374
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,970
fiber in this fucking thing. Phytonutrients. I don't know what that word means, but it sounds

375
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:51,579
pretty scientific. Only five grams of sugar. None of this like fucking 40 grams of sugar.

376
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:57,460
Bullshit soda crap that you drink. Gluten free and soy free. So what the fuck's your problem,

377
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:03,130
man? It's good. I like it. I'm going to keep drinking it. Whether you like it or not.

378
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:21,399
Streamer loves hairy drink. It's my hair. That was my own fault. Water is superior.

379
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:31,699
Water is good too. I drink water too. Oh, we have to extract this person.

380
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:43,140
It's her. Stubborn son of a bitch probably just killed us all.

381
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:53,430
You got a new clip for me? Hold on. I'm busy. What the fuck just happened to you?

382
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:59,819
I'm playing a game. Is this some kind of, I'm like a simulation or something.

383
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:21,210
What do you want me to do? I guess I just leave? Shoot. Can't press any buttons or anything.

384
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:43,609
You're Hue-lucinating. I'm going to catch her. God damn it. I can't believe one of my fucking

385
01:12:43,689 --> 01:13:00,819
hairs fell in. Was that supposed to be on screen? I feel like that was supposed to be a little

386
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:21,500
bit more blurry. Did we just get nuked? What? Why did we get nuked? Oh, I got to make room for the

387
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:56,250
fuel. Oh, it's good shit. It really is. I swear to God. Like Agent Smith's or something? That was

388
01:13:56,250 --> 01:14:09,859
the ending to Fear 1. Was it? I don't remember any of that. What's this? You guys are spamming,

389
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:20,039
you guys are spamming me with a video. I'm getting spammed. You don't pay attention to

390
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:30,810
Laura. That's why. Guys, I played Fear 1 like three years ago. All right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

391
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:34,170
I'll listen to the video. I'll listen to the video. What do you guys want me to hear so bad?

392
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:47,050
Jerma is so nice. A piece of slime that's been scraped off of the bottom of a sewer. What?

393
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:55,029
And Jerma is like a piece of better slime that has been scraped off of the top of the sewer.

394
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:58,949
He's the top of the sewer and I'm the bottom. Wait, I didn't.

395
01:15:02,779 --> 01:15:12,970
Okay. Um, I think I'm fucking carved out of stone, if I'm honest with you. I think that

396
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:19,380
fucking God threw down lightning down and Saint Peter fucking carved me out of a goddamn slab of

397
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:32,279
stone. Zeus struck the lightning down. It turned into me. Exactly what somebody that is at the top

398
01:15:32,279 --> 01:15:43,739
of the slime would say. Oh, okay. Sure thing. Whatever. He's stoned. Okay, I did not expect

399
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:52,949
that guy to be there. Ego maniac. And use a gun. And if that don't work, use more guns.

400
01:15:53,510 --> 01:16:09,260
Grab it. What are they doing to me? He's alive. Holy shit, that's not how you have surgery done.

401
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:26,010
What are they fucking doing? Oh my God. Oh, we're gonna we have just as general appendix surgery.

402
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:27,449
Nothing that we have to be afraid of.

403
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,890
This is just two guys playing surgeon simulator on some asshole.

404
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:56,180
That was insane. This game is fucking crazy. I don't have any organs left.

405
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:15,689
I have no organs. Put your gamer glasses on. I don't have any. Google Glass. All right. Intel.

406
01:17:15,689 --> 01:17:34,649
Who cares? Find a weapon. I'm gonna okay. I've been I've swallowed so much air from laughing

407
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:42,039
at random stuff while trying to drink at the same time. So it's gonna happen. I try I'm gonna try

408
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:47,020
as hard as I can. This is why I don't put cameras on. I fucking hate webcams. I don't want a web

409
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:56,939
cam on me. I don't get it off. Turn it off right now. Is that toilet backwards? Isn't that supposed

410
01:17:56,939 --> 01:18:08,390
to be the other way? Why is that? That looks different to me. No, no. Right? No. Isn't that

411
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:13,960
like the lip is crooked? Yeah, I know. But like isn't the lip this the space is there? I guess

412
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:32,920
some toilets have the space. I need a weapon. It's not a weapon. Get out of this fucking place.

413
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:55,699
Oh, are you in terms of service? No, but I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Don't worry. Are you afraid?

414
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:59,140
I mean, I could be a little a little a little chilly right now. You know, I'm a little cold.

415
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:25,560
Uh, I'm not scared. You should be. Well, I'm not. Wait, okay. I thought that was a guy leaning back

416
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:31,960
with a gun. Like N64 style. Like he like he looked like Polygon. I thought he was like had a gun back

417
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,640
there. I was like what the fuck is this guy with a gun doing back here?

418
01:19:41,909 --> 01:19:54,619
Save the game? I think it's doing it. It's automatically doing it. Open. Open the door.

419
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:25,689
Why do these don't open? Okay. Oh, a professional doctor. Did it hurt me? Oh, it's for cover. I get

420
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:56,939
it. Blood. Blood. Smash or I don't know. Whatever. Oh no, more blood. Blood. Blood. What a weird

421
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:04,069
substance. It's so bizarre that we have like human oil that like makes us run. This is weird.

422
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:29,449
Uh, well, how do what am I supposed to do? Is there another way to go? Restricted area.

423
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:47,109
Uh, running in circles? No, I'm not. I'm here. Here's. How am I speed bagging this thing?

424
01:21:47,109 --> 01:21:53,979
Jerma, go read an analog clock. Give me one. Give me one. Give me a time. I'll do it right now. I'm

425
01:21:53,979 --> 01:22:06,390
not high. I've not had any CBD, any THC, none today. Zero. Read any analog clock you want.

426
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:18,859
Can I just go in? Whoa, it's control. Hold on. Is this something? I can't like get out of this.

427
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:48,180
Come on. What? Oh dude, this is really spooky. It kind of is. What was he holding? Is this a bottle

428
01:22:48,180 --> 01:23:21,779
of hydrogen peroxide? Where did he even come from? It's Pepto-Bismol. I need a gun, right?

429
01:23:21,779 --> 01:23:26,619
I'm getting more. There's more spam going on here. All right. After this, no more links.

430
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:40,600
Wait, are we going to do this thing? Hold on. I need to put like a different shirt and pretend

431
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:47,029
like I'm seeing this another day. Give me one. Give me a second. Hold on. I'm going to put like

432
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,909
another game in the background too. Hold on. Give me one. I'll be right back.

433
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:19,109
Oh, this is fine. I can just put this around my neck and stuff. This works. I have different

434
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:39,560
hair though. Look at all these cat boys. I'll change my background, right? I'm wearing like

435
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:49,699
a big elaborate sweater today. I'm not going to be blue. I'll be, I don't know, green. Yeah,

436
01:24:49,699 --> 01:25:09,579
it's like a different day. Yeah, it's really sunny up today. I just woke up in the morning

437
01:25:09,579 --> 01:25:22,649
and like this is like it's tomorrow. I'm going to be like, what the fuck is this?

438
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:41,189
Sounds like it was bright this morning. Okay. Well, I need the video. I'm going to be fucking

439
01:25:41,189 --> 01:26:05,640
mad that you guys linked this to me this early. What the fuck is this? It's too early for this,

440
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:14,380
dude. It's way too early for this. I just fucking got up and you guys are linking me this.

441
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:30,579
When was this? Yesterday? Whatever. I'm going back to bed. Fucking come out of here.

442
01:26:30,579 --> 01:26:56,949
I hate this. Just turn the stream off now. Turn off the stream now. Like I was never live.

443
01:26:57,909 --> 01:27:11,210
No, I have to play fucking Fear 2. I went to bed. It's tomorrow. Restart. You've ruined it. What?

444
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:23,529
What do you mean restart? Do it again? You choked in the end. You were fucked in the head. Oh,

445
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:34,409
I read that wrong. I'm not even at the tutorial. Too early for this. All right. I have to play

446
01:27:34,409 --> 01:27:51,659
the fucking game. Don't mind me. I'm here, but I'm Sansom. Fuck. It's just going to do

447
01:27:51,659 --> 01:28:01,319
what it's going to do and I don't care anymore. Yes, I do. Of course I do. All right. Can I please

448
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:35,020
play the game? It's been ages. I thought he said Colonel Sanders. Colonel Sanders, I've taken them

449
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:43,960
out. Oh, that's good. Now come back. We're a $5 fill-up box. We can't let them get away with

450
01:28:43,960 --> 01:29:03,619
their secret rash at me. I need a gun. You're a budget Anakin Skywalker. That's okay. Like,

451
01:29:03,619 --> 01:29:07,220
do you think that's going to make me mad or like pissed off or something? Why would that make me

452
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:14,180
angry? The most powerful fucking Jedi on earth. The coolest, most destructive, awesome force of

453
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:20,970
a person. Budget that. That's still fucking one of the best in the world. So I don't care. That's

454
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:28,789
fine.

455
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:42,710
THC lab. All right. I know. I know. I can't believe it. I can't.

456
01:29:44,180 --> 01:30:26,140
No? Okay. Gotta go to the THC lab. What's this face I'm doing? Ambush. I still need a weapon.

457
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:54,060
Slow-mo. He's dead? Look at that guy. What? Why did he explode? Was he made out of glass?

458
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,659
That's what it is. Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

459
01:31:10,890 --> 01:31:25,560
All right. I'm fine. I don't want to hear that. X marks the spot. Nope. And links. No more links.

460
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:42,149
I ain't looking at any links. No more links. I gotta get out of the tutorial first. Hey,

461
01:31:49,989 --> 01:32:20,710
you guys. What the fuck? Oh shit. Come on. We have bugleberry soldiers. I don't die.

462
01:32:21,430 --> 01:33:13,979
Oh, is he still shooting? It was rigor mortis. Oh, he's still alive? Okay. I'm coming to save you.

463
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:26,279
Open the door. I'm here to save you. I'm here to save you. I'm here to rescue you. Ma'am, open the

464
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:39,720
door. I'm here to save you. Open the door. I'm trying to get you out of here. Ma'am, I'm trying

465
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:59,369
to help you. Open the door. Any snacks in there? Watch this. Which one's going to be left or right?

466
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:37,029
Open, open, open, open. What? Is he dead before we hit the ground? No. Oh shit. Did they remove it?

467
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:55,689
That was like the best part of the first game. Anymore? Oh shit. Open the... I fucking missed it.

468
01:34:55,689 --> 01:35:12,149
That was supposed to be scary and I just turned around. The camera is out of sync.

469
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:47,529
No, it's not. It is. What the hell are you talking about? Oh, it isn't. You made that up. They did.

470
01:35:47,529 --> 01:36:06,020
Of course they did. I know they did. Can I get up there? Oh, go this way. Steam hurt? No, it better

471
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:16,420
not. I'd be pissed if it did. Locate a working elevator to the third floor. Melee. Okay, Melee.

472
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:35,060
Hey, don't look over here. No, redo that part. I want to kick him down the elevator.

473
01:36:35,699 --> 01:36:48,170
Redo that part. I want to sneak up behind him and kick him down the elevator.

474
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:57,529
Melee fans. Melee fans. Melee fans. What are you saying that for? All right, let's go. It's

475
01:36:57,529 --> 01:37:14,300
literally a half second behind. That's impossible. There's nothing on there that would... This is

476
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:25,060
impossible. It's impossible and I'm not even gonna give it any more thought. Okay, here we go.

477
01:37:35,819 --> 01:38:02,500
Just get down there already. Okay, we're good. Who's next? Got a grenade. I can't get in here.

478
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:09,399
Don't even need to be in there. Who cares? It's delayed. Listen to the people. The webcam is

479
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:37,000
delayed. I've had just about enough of this shit. How's that? Does that sound good? Fixed. Fixed.

480
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,760
Worse. Worse. Oh, that's really funny because I didn't do anything at all. I just clicked the

481
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:44,439
webcam on and off, pretended to change the setting, and then you guys pretended it got worse.

482
01:38:44,439 --> 01:39:08,579
I win. I like that blue. It's a nice blue. Stop smurfing, bro. What do you mean stop smurfing?

483
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:15,180
There's no levels in this game. All right, scratch the itchy face part of my face.

484
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:51,609
Got a key card. Based. You're based. Smurf. All right. Reflex injector. I mean, where am I?

485
01:39:51,609 --> 01:40:02,119
What just happened? Reflex injector? What does that mean? Urgent warning. No. Tab. Where is it?

486
01:40:03,829 --> 01:40:17,689
Why do I keep teleporting around? Somebody will help me. Whatever. I don't care. This door can

487
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:31,130
open. No, it can't. Can I go in another door? How about this one? Upgrades the slow-mo duration.

488
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:44,119
Oh, okay. Cool. Where else am I supposed to go? Did I get everything in here? I don't actually

489
01:40:44,119 --> 01:41:10,420
have to move this, right? You're so bad. Dude, the heal crash is real. The heal crash. Yeah,

490
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:34,409
because I had to go in here. I can't move this. Press E. I can't do anything. Use your brain. Use

491
01:41:34,409 --> 01:41:57,930
your mind. E. I don't think I am. Where am I supposed to go? I went down here. I've already

492
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:10,380
been in here. Was there another key card door to go in? Oh, okay. Over here. Why is everything

493
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:24,420
blocked off by boxes? I win. Did I miss another jump scare? What's the cam even on for if I'm

494
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:41,750
just going to miss these? Oh, that's a monk at TOS. I shot him. I stopped that. I very clearly

495
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:52,279
shot that before it happened. Come on. I played House of the Dead before. That's bullshit. I want

496
01:42:52,279 --> 01:43:30,140
my extra one health. They just explode. Damn. Damn. Oh, damn. Any more? Getting just blood splatters

497
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:33,659
in your face and having bullets hit you in the head is way more scary than the girl walking

498
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:46,899
slowly behind a glass door. Shotgun. Oh, hell yeah. Finally. It only took 100 million years to get

499
01:43:46,899 --> 01:44:17,000
this. Wait. It's still tutorial, right? Never mind. You already shot gun. What? This way. Getting

500
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:27,800
close to the lobby. There's some kind of activity. Check out the activity in the lobby. Got it. Oh,

501
01:44:27,800 --> 01:45:04,859
shit. I'm not that scared of this. All right. Which one is she in? We're going to unzip number

502
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:10,020
one. Unzip number... No. Which one are we unzipping? Who's going to come out of the morgue and who's

503
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:40,949
going to grab me? Hopefully this wasn't like a prank. All right. Going up. The entire game is

504
01:45:40,949 --> 01:46:04,489
a prank. Out of coffee. That's a problem. Now, how do I get it to move? Here we go. Get to the

505
01:46:04,489 --> 01:46:11,079
third floor. Third floor. This would be the second floor. Is this the third floor? What floor is this?

506
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:42,039
Why is it not moving anymore? Press and hold. I'm not soft-locked. I'm fine. Lots of body armor,

507
01:46:42,039 --> 01:46:48,630
which I think is awesome. All right. Something behind this door. Slow-mo through here. Nope.

508
01:46:48,630 --> 01:47:08,119
Can't go through here. Of course we can. Of course not. You're right. There's a million clocks on the

509
01:47:08,119 --> 01:47:22,409
wall. Oh, shit. Okay. It is exactly 3 p.m. Three o'clock. Done. See? I'll do another one. Wait,

510
01:47:22,409 --> 01:47:43,989
why would all the clocks be different times? Dude, the guys that explode. It's just... He wouldn't

511
01:47:43,989 --> 01:47:52,520
even aim it at me. Like I was playing VR. His gun was like bouncing all around. Like down, up, left,

512
01:47:52,520 --> 01:48:02,949
right. You got... Hey, you got... Sorry. Room's not big enough, dude. You got to do seated play. What

513
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:25,560
does that do? All right. Frag grenade. He slowly realized that that was not going to stop and

514
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:37,529
explosion from killing him. Oh, fuck. Pick it up and throw it back. Oh, jeez. Hold on.

515
01:48:55,609 --> 01:49:11,000
Look at his little... His little like shimmy. Oh, I'm on fucking fire. How do I get to...

516
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:22,489
Turn the sink on. Oh, you dick. This reminds me of the time that I had a wart on my finger. Me too.

517
01:49:23,449 --> 01:49:44,229
Wow. We're so alike, you and I. How did you miss that? There we go. That was creepy. What?

518
01:49:44,949 --> 01:50:02,659
No, that was like a, hey, you and me. We get it. That was creepy. You never been like, hey, hey, hey.

519
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:15,079
Hey, easy. Hey, you're an ego. You never been like, oh, yeah, hey, we're going to go over here.

520
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:31,850
Yeah, here we are. That's like a nudge. Like, hey, hey, you and me. We get it. You know,

521
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:45,100
ladies and gentlemen, fellas, I was begged to wink every day. Every single day of my life,

522
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:52,489
I was begged to wink to you. And now all of a sudden, when you don't have to pay for it,

523
01:50:53,050 --> 01:51:10,229
when it's free, you don't like it anymore. What is going on there? I don't know. I thought that

524
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:28,199
was a pineapple. Too bright. Don't like it. All right. Where are we going? Where are we going?

525
01:51:29,590 --> 01:52:14,859
Get to the THC lab. Let me get into the chamber. Oh, come on. Pay attention. This is like driving

526
01:52:14,859 --> 01:52:33,399
a car and looking over at somebody. Pay attention to the road. I can turn into a skeleton.

527
01:52:35,239 --> 01:52:50,869
I'm adjusting my VR headset. I tell you, this is a VR game. Honey? Honey, it's dad. Simpson's

528
01:52:50,869 --> 01:53:25,350
thing over there. Hold on. I wish I could slow it down. What the fuck was that? Was that a mole?

529
01:53:25,989 --> 01:53:32,229
Did I have somebody on the inside? Did he press the button and start firing at them?

530
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:45,260
The guy on the left. What was that? There it is. Finally. Finally, we got it. Finally, he says it.

531
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:56,729
Finally. It took two hours. Holy shit. Oh, I'm so glad we get to hear it again. I missed it so much.

532
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:17,159
You're just working the angle, Jerma. What does that mean? I changed the camera? So it doesn't

533
01:54:17,159 --> 01:54:27,590
look like I'm trying to work an angle? Should I put the camera somewhere else so I'm not trying

534
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:31,350
to make it look like I look good or something? What do you mean, working the angle? Like this

535
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:54,250
angle? What if I sit back here? You're working it. What do you mean? If only I was good at

536
01:54:54,250 --> 01:55:00,199
multiplayer games like this, I could get rid of people like this. Jerma, you're playing dense.

537
01:55:00,199 --> 01:55:10,979
I'm 35. I don't know any words on the internet. Guys, I haven't posted a selfie of myself or a

538
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:17,739
picture of myself to the internet like ever. The Twitter fucking Thanksgiving ham video was

539
01:55:17,739 --> 01:55:30,970
the last time I did it. I don't know what that means. Hey, Esoteris, thanks for the ten community

540
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:42,520
subs. Thanks a lot. So two weeks ago. Yeah. And then go back half to two weeks. How long has it been?

541
01:55:44,220 --> 01:56:05,979
Like years. Sing the sub song. Here you go. This is what you want. This is why everybody's here.

542
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:09,430
Don't fucking pretend like this is not the reason why you're here.

543
01:56:19,899 --> 01:56:27,819
Take it and run with it. That's why you're all here. Did that hurt?

544
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:42,600
Oh, we got out of the tutorial cutscene. Jerma keyboard font. I don't know what that means.

545
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:48,310
Wait, you want like a... I can't... I don't... What? You want me to make my own font?

546
01:56:48,310 --> 01:57:05,909
Next grenade type. Next grenade type? Incendiary grenades. Oh shit. Oh shit. This is very flammable.

547
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:26,390
I feel like he just set that up wrong, right? I feel like I didn't even do anything. Like,

548
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:42,439
I don't think that should have happened. He installed that incorrectly. The energy of your

549
01:57:42,439 --> 01:57:54,779
stream is off. What do you mean? Energy? What does that mean? The energy of your stream is off.

550
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:14,390
You're talking about like at my audio level? You need more vibe. Okay. This is for a vibe.

551
01:58:15,109 --> 01:58:27,579
I'm playing the game now. You're too loud. You just walk next to an explosive. Well,

552
01:58:27,579 --> 01:58:31,180
I'm not paying attention to the road right now. I'm looking... I'm talking to one of the passengers

553
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:39,399
in the car here. So like this is what I'm talking about. All right, hold on. Watch this. Ready?

554
01:58:39,399 --> 01:59:11,159
Do you know... All right, so somebody was just like, you know what? I'm gonna kill both of them

555
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:20,539
because like this is the chance I got and he's standing there still. So I'm gonna go for it.

556
01:59:20,539 --> 01:59:25,420
Harry, I'm sorry, but this is the guy and I'm just going for it. He's standing still.

557
01:59:25,420 --> 02:00:04,939
Why am I shaking? I love it so much. The whole stream is a prank. I don't think so. What do you

558
02:00:04,939 --> 02:00:26,760
mean? That was a default. Holy shit. Why can I pick this up? How the... Okay. How can I pick

559
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:37,180
that grenade up? Different grenade type? Yeah. Wasn't I holding five? Your vibes are better.

560
02:00:37,180 --> 02:00:53,619
You could get it. What's this crack that I'm seeing? Oh, fuck. Got him. Okay, we're good.

561
02:01:04,729 --> 02:01:14,899
Wait. How did he burn? What is he doing? What the fuck? He looked at it and it made him catch

562
02:01:14,899 --> 02:01:41,239
on fire. Why? Whatever. Hey, look, we got good vibes now. Where should I go? In here? I heard

563
02:01:41,239 --> 02:02:01,909
grenade. Why did that last so long? Good vibes and chill. Yeah, that's true. That's what I'm

564
02:02:01,909 --> 02:02:14,340
talking about. Boom. Yeah, we're just chilling out. What are you guys talking about? Oh, my...

565
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:21,539
I gotta use my shotgun for a little while. Hold on, wait. Live, laugh, love.

566
02:02:21,939 --> 02:02:33,180
Hard mode. This is too easy, please. No, I'm just vibing, right? We're just hanging out.

567
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:54,659
I say it and everybody gets mad. Nice. Thank God. I was gonna be so mad if I couldn't hit

568
02:02:54,659 --> 02:03:13,079
that phone off the wall. Okay, where? Beers? Hold on, wait. Did he just respond to that by saying

569
02:03:13,079 --> 02:03:36,649
shit? What the fuck is going on? Oh, he didn't throw it very far. Back up. Back up.

570
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:56,229
There's a lot of smoke. The smoke just everywhere. Okay, hold on. Give me the shotgun again.

571
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:32,539
What was that? Did I shoot myself in the chin? What? What the hell was that? It was the fire...

572
02:04:32,539 --> 02:04:43,659
Wait, those explode that far? That's crazy. That's not what it was. No, guys, that was not what it

573
02:04:43,659 --> 02:04:56,729
was. I want to check that out. All right, hold on. That's a huge explosion. It was what it was. Okay.

574
02:04:57,609 --> 02:05:09,979
I did not think that was gonna happen. Nothing? Okay, down here. How the fuck do you do that? I

575
02:05:09,979 --> 02:05:39,220
don't know. Somebody said, it's okay. Vibes stable. Thank God. I thought that was a clown.

576
02:05:39,220 --> 02:05:54,020
I'm gonna be honest. I thought that was a clown. Whoops. What's he doing? What's he reaching for?

577
02:05:54,020 --> 02:06:32,869
What are you doing? What the fuck is this guy? Die! Okay, give me that thing. Oh shit, nice.

578
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:50,789
Let's do a spy check. He's doing the thing the stuntman does in every movie.

579
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:58,859
This thing. When they're on fire and they just go like this, they're engulfed in fucking flames

580
02:06:58,859 --> 02:07:08,359
and they just do the... And they just slowly are taking one or two little steps at a time

581
02:07:08,359 --> 02:07:15,899
because it's like, holy shit, this is a real dude and he's really on fire. So you have to be really

582
02:07:15,899 --> 02:07:25,659
careful. Imagine being in that suit though and just knowing like, holy shit, I am completely

583
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:35,029
engulfed in fire. Everything from head to toe. I am a golem from... I'm a golem. I'm the fire

584
02:07:35,029 --> 02:07:42,260
golem from Diablo 2. Not a golem. A golem. That's what I was trying to say. Golem from Diablo 2.

585
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:46,779
Fire golem. It would have been... You would have understood if I said it faster without stopping

586
02:07:46,779 --> 02:08:08,810
and going... And then blocking it in my brain. Delay's getting even worse. Okay, sure thing.

587
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:20,779
Fix it, idiot. I don't know how. Fucking idiot streamer. Can't do anything.

588
02:08:26,170 --> 02:09:04,979
Fucking idiot. All right. Shotgun. Take it. Shotgun. Got it. Oh no, vibe levels are critical.

589
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:12,380
What do I do to fix the vibe levels? Why does he move his whole body to dodge things?

590
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:19,020
Because I don't know. That's something from Super Mario. I got it from my mother.

591
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:25,500
Anytime my mother wanted to make a jump across a platform or something, she would always do this.

592
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:29,659
So she would be running, right? Like Mario's running across the screen and she would jump

593
02:09:29,659 --> 02:09:35,189
and she'd go... And it somehow helped. It helped her get to the other side somehow.

594
02:09:36,859 --> 02:09:50,090
And I don't know. It's just that it stuck with me. Mama. That's right. That guy was terrible.

595
02:09:50,729 --> 02:10:25,670
He's alive. Shit. Grenade. What? Okay. I was going to say that didn't... This game's like fun though.

596
02:10:25,670 --> 02:10:30,569
I actually kind of like this. You kicked at his ankles and it killed him. Yeah. Well,

597
02:10:30,569 --> 02:10:49,000
he only had like two health left. What is it? Oh no, his vibe levels. His telesthetic vibe

598
02:10:49,000 --> 02:11:00,199
levels are critical right now. They're off the charts at the moment. Easy. I've been here.

599
02:11:00,199 --> 02:11:31,609
Will he know that the grenade's behind him? He's trying to run away. Where did that guy go?

600
02:11:54,380 --> 02:12:14,439
Holy shit. That was so fucking bad. That was so shitty. That was like... There was just no way he

601
02:12:14,439 --> 02:12:19,500
was going to be in the bathroom. You know what I mean? There was no reason anyone was going to be

602
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:35,109
in here. In fact, I think that's actually the guy. Somebody said, town NPC death sound.

603
02:12:43,619 --> 02:12:52,710
He walked up to like one of the villagers and just like stabbed him. God damn it.

604
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:10,869
Can we hear it? Does anybody have it? This stream has been all over the fucking place.

605
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:23,289
Clip's a band. For what? Link's a band. Oh shit. Because I was getting spammed. Oh my god.

606
02:13:24,010 --> 02:13:31,560
Or not even dead. That's just like you... A NPC in town runs away. Because you pressed Z and

607
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:40,300
unholstered your shotgun. Right? And it's just like, crazy guy, run! Like that's in Red Dead.

608
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:43,979
You know what I mean? You have the holster and you like pull it out. And all of a sudden

609
02:13:43,979 --> 02:13:56,010
people are just like... But Link's a band. Whatever. In the saloon, you just open the door.

610
02:14:06,739 --> 02:14:14,810
I didn't even do that. Did I do that? Did I kill that guy? Was that scripted or did I shoot him?

611
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:41,670
I didn't do that. Is the guy's head talking? This guy's head is screaming. What was that?

612
02:14:44,579 --> 02:15:00,810
You just kicked me like... I can't... Why are you doing this? Stop doing this.

613
02:15:06,539 --> 02:15:09,180
Where are they coming from? Stop spawning.

614
02:15:16,779 --> 02:15:21,579
I need a break. I need to take a break. Why are they... I don't know where they're going.

615
02:15:25,670 --> 02:15:30,789
Why are they all limping? Why is every NPC limping? I'm going crazy pills.

616
02:15:31,510 --> 02:16:12,300
Okay. Every NPC is limping. Okay. That was a little scary. I'm kind of concerned about that.

617
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:27,930
I'm a little concerned. What happened to that guy? That guy's head's gone.

618
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:41,370
Oh, shit. I'm afraid to go down there. We're gonna long distance that one.

619
02:16:41,370 --> 02:17:10,280
Grenades go up. What do you think? What do you think? I don't hear like a radio tune.

620
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:56,260
I just came from here. Yeah, I know. But what? Did that guy blow up in here? Holy shit. What

621
02:17:56,260 --> 02:18:43,290
happened to that guy? You're alive? Impossible. Impossible. Did I get him? I think I got him.

622
02:18:53,879 --> 02:19:10,819
Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Throws grenade. Yes. Yes, that's true. Well,

623
02:19:10,819 --> 02:19:13,620
if I have them, I'm going to use them. Why would I not use the grenades? They're incredibly

624
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:33,479
destructive. They're so good. Where do I go? Nade Andy. Whatever. That's fine. I can't open this.

625
02:19:33,479 --> 02:19:52,459
Can I not get this open? Oh, there was a big X on it. Like this doesn't work. I want more coffee.

626
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:19,129
Okay. Oh, health pack. Nice. 5pm coffee. Sometimes you need a little bit to keep

627
02:20:19,129 --> 02:20:25,379
you going, you know? That's all right. I'd say a coffee after like five or six. You gotta be

628
02:20:25,379 --> 02:20:51,500
careful. You don't want to do too much. But a little one. That's fine. And me, right? Okay.

629
02:20:51,500 --> 02:21:29,379
Time to fight this thing. What? How many are there? Oh, what the fuck? Did I get him?

630
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:45,399
Okay. We're good. We're fine. We're fine. We're fine. You can't just like bite me and then run

631
02:21:45,399 --> 02:21:58,899
away. What is he doing? He's trying to get a hiding spot. Give me the shotgun. Shotgun better.

632
02:22:01,379 --> 02:22:28,709
Oh yeah. They're like little dogs. Okay. Get out. Out, out, out, out. Move, move, move.

633
02:22:28,709 --> 02:22:44,340
Through the ceiling. Here we go. One, two, three. No. Okay. We're fine. What's going on with this guy?

634
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:57,879
Can I do anything with this guy? No. This guy's just dead. Why are they filming this? Get that

635
02:22:57,879 --> 02:23:19,670
out of here. What the fuck? Yep. I knew it. I was waiting for it. No, you're going to do it. It's

636
02:23:19,670 --> 02:23:29,180
going to... Didn't do it. Wow. Okay. I'm actually pretty surprised that they did not do that. Oh,

637
02:23:29,180 --> 02:23:44,739
okay. Remember, you promised a sly cooper. When is sly cooper? Yeah, I fucked it up. My PS3. All

638
02:23:44,739 --> 02:23:51,399
right. Those either weren't here. My PlayStation 3 smelled like burnt plastic when I played anything.

639
02:23:51,399 --> 02:23:57,139
So I had to try to find a solution to it. When I play with my PlayStation 3, it smells like burnt

640
02:23:57,139 --> 02:24:02,299
plastic. Bad. To a point where it makes me give me like a headache. So I can't use it. So I gotta

641
02:24:02,299 --> 02:24:13,159
figure out what to do. This button will toggle power to the doors. I just locked them and the

642
02:24:13,159 --> 02:24:34,889
x-ray. Okay. What are they doing? Do an emulator. I actually tried to use an emulator, but I got a

643
02:24:34,889 --> 02:24:39,450
ton of awful interlacing and it was just ugly and horrible to look at. I tried to do a bunch of

644
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:44,329
different settings, try to change what it looked like and just wasn't happy with it. So until I

645
02:24:44,329 --> 02:25:00,340
can do that, I'm just going to get another PlayStation 3. This is open. Yeah, it was really

646
02:25:00,340 --> 02:25:04,360
just ugly. Frames were blending and it was, there was a lot of weird ghosting and blending

647
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:13,700
and I was just like, I, I'll just buy another PS3. German put art on so I can eat. Um,

648
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:40,010
I'll take a break in like 20 minutes. Oh, we're out. Holy. I tried to shoot. That, that guy's

649
02:25:40,010 --> 02:25:49,780
entire skeleton was okay. That was ridiculous. That guy got like slow cooked for like four or

650
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:53,879
five straight days. All the meat just fell off the bone. Like you couldn't, you didn't have to

651
02:25:53,879 --> 02:26:22,170
try. Holy shit. Watch it. I don't do anything stupid. You got a broken leg. All right. He's

652
02:26:22,170 --> 02:26:43,079
got a broken leg, a, uh, broken collarbone and a broken jaw. Okay. Fix him. I can't. I'm not a

653
02:26:43,079 --> 02:27:01,420
doctor. I squeeze through. I cannot squeeze through that. Play Mega Man. Uh, no, not right now. Get

654
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:47,780
out of here. It's quiet. It's too quiet. Hey, are you all right? What did he throw? What did he

655
02:27:47,780 --> 02:28:26,569
throw? What just happened? What was it here? He's back. Why did that guy get a respawn?

656
02:28:26,569 --> 02:28:41,190
That guy's back was towards me. Well, really painting the barn. I don't even know what that

657
02:28:41,190 --> 02:29:01,909
means. Gunplay is pretty good in this game though. I like the gunplay. It's, it's really responsive,

658
02:29:01,909 --> 02:29:08,100
really responsive gunplay. See, when I say the word gunplay enough times, you guys will then

659
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:12,180
respect my review coming later because I said that word and you guys go, oh yeah, he knows what

660
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:16,340
that means. He's like, he's, you know, the lingo of like playing games, like reviewing him and shit.

661
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:43,110
This guy's locked in here. Uh, careful. You have to compare this to Dark Souls. I don't think I can

662
02:29:43,110 --> 02:29:49,700
do that. I'm not sure that's possible. I don't think I can compare this to Dark Souls. He has

663
02:29:49,700 --> 02:30:12,329
an extension cord in his body. That's what that is, right? Okay. Whatever. Whatever. It's glass.

664
02:30:12,409 --> 02:30:25,290
I keep thinking it's, I can shoot through it. I was trying to, alt, alt.

665
02:30:40,739 --> 02:31:11,340
He got on top of me twice. Fucking sticky keys. Radio? No. Oh, lower disc. You guys do that too

666
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:14,379
when there's a bunch of people, you're at like a tourist attraction. Everyone's just taking

667
02:31:14,379 --> 02:31:18,059
pictures and you're like, I have to fucking go. I have to walk by and I'm not going to sit here

668
02:31:18,059 --> 02:31:23,579
for like fucking 25 minutes while like 10 of you take photos. Go down, crouch and you like get

669
02:31:23,579 --> 02:31:36,309
underneath their picture. Who's that? No, I just run across. No, you can't do that

670
02:31:36,309 --> 02:31:47,620
because then you'll end up, you'll be like a blur. What's that? Oh, nice. Crouching is worse.

671
02:31:47,620 --> 02:32:02,389
You end up like, there's like a head and somebody like crouching by. I somehow didn't get hit by

672
02:32:02,389 --> 02:32:13,379
that. I don't know. I don't know how. Uh, can I go? How do I make the elevator go? Go elevator,

673
02:32:13,379 --> 02:32:28,700
go up. Press the, I just made it. Level three recognition.

674
02:32:34,700 --> 02:32:47,700
Fuck. God damn it. I got to be ready for it. It's black. I can't even, I can't shoot through it.

675
02:32:48,420 --> 02:33:27,100
What's going on? Does he swallow it? I feel like he swallowed that. Holy shit. Gulp. Uh, excuse me.

676
02:33:28,059 --> 02:33:45,620
I gotta go down. Worst, worst. Don't do worst noise. Whatever. Find a way out of the outer

677
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:59,670
shell before it is destroyed. Okay. I can do that. Maybe. I feel like I'm playing Portal 2.

678
02:33:59,670 --> 02:34:17,260
I don't know why. Getting Portal 2 vibes. Oh, he got, wait, he's getting burnt by what?

679
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:23,829
Oh, he's stood in front of the jacuzzi jet. Careful, dude. You never, don't ever do that.

680
02:34:24,549 --> 02:34:46,219
Come on. Jesus. Come on. Oh, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right. Go, go, go.

681
02:34:46,860 --> 02:35:09,239
Everybody calling me grenade Andy. I mean, you get so many of them and they do so much damage.

682
02:35:09,239 --> 02:35:23,000
Why wouldn't I use them? I think I've thrown 70 or 80 grenades in this playthrough so far.

683
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:46,299
They're just everywhere. Why not just use them? Of course, I'm going to throw them. Um, what?

684
02:35:46,299 --> 02:35:49,899
I don't know what that was, but apparently that guy killed the other guy somehow. His body,

685
02:35:49,899 --> 02:36:07,579
I don't know. His corpse was break dancing. Okay. A shock grenade. Ooh. Kind of want to try this.

686
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:23,579
What the fuck? CDPR really dropped the ball here. It kind of is the cyberpunk music, isn't it?

687
02:36:32,459 --> 02:36:41,579
Just goes like, Oh, here we go, man. I'm about to get into a big fight in cyberpunk.

688
02:36:52,069 --> 02:37:07,930
Cool. I'm dead. Whatever. Oh, that's right. He's making a cyberpunk joke. I have to make one.

689
02:37:08,729 --> 02:37:26,459
All right. I got to get down there before they get up. Let me in. What are these guys doing?

690
02:37:28,299 --> 02:37:35,379
Who's driving the forklift? Who's driving the forklift? What the fuck?

691
02:37:38,899 --> 02:37:49,139
Some guys just like backing up for the forklift. How do you feel about your cyberpunk cameo?

692
02:37:49,940 --> 02:38:00,620
I don't have a cyberpunk cameo. All right, come on. Got to get in the door before they get over there.

693
02:38:13,559 --> 02:38:22,139
Is somebody in there still? Punch him. Punch him. Punch him. What the hell is this? An assault rifle?

694
02:38:27,049 --> 02:38:49,719
Oh, nice. I'm doing okay, I think. The music is kind of overpowering my brain.

695
02:38:50,440 --> 02:38:58,780
Throw more grenades. I'm already throwing a bunch of grenades, man.

696
02:39:24,379 --> 02:39:30,629
It's too much stimulation. It's a lot of stimulation. Too much. It's too much stimulation.

697
02:39:31,270 --> 02:40:00,100
This guy's still alive. Is that guy alive? Wait. No, get down. No, he's just stuck in the ground.

698
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:20,170
Okay, whatever. Good vibes only. Swap weapons. E. I know how to do that already.

699
02:40:20,170 --> 02:40:33,129
He's checking his armpits. He's smelling his armpits to see if he has smelly armpits.

700
02:40:34,090 --> 02:41:16,170
Got him. He's not going to explode, is he? He might. Oh, get. Where's my red dot? Where's the red dot

701
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:28,739
sight? Oh, we're going to get a comedy fall. That was not funny. A person exploding. That's

702
02:41:29,379 --> 02:42:01,209
not a comedy fall. He was supposed to fall down. Where are they running? What? I feel like I'm

703
02:42:01,209 --> 02:42:06,250
playing on a tiny map in a shooter game, and people were just spawning and killing each other.

704
02:42:06,250 --> 02:42:19,079
Spawn, die. Spawn, die. Spawn, die, die. Spawn, die. Just infinite respawn. Instant respawn.

705
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:55,459
No reloads. Okay. I don't know. I don't. So, let's. I don't want that. I want the health.

706
02:42:55,459 --> 02:43:09,719
That was a tuber reaction. What, going like this? Oh, it's links. Is that a tuber reaction? That's

707
02:43:09,719 --> 02:43:14,459
not really a tuber reaction. That's just a. Well, look at what we're doing. We're killing this guy.

708
02:43:19,979 --> 02:43:25,430
You know what else? Okay. First impressions of Fear 2. I feel like there's been no downtime.

709
02:43:25,989 --> 02:43:32,260
It's just been spawn and kill people. Just run through. This is just a never-ending instant

710
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:40,170
respawn FPS map. And I'm doing really well. I'm like fucking 75 and 2. I don't even know

711
02:43:40,170 --> 02:44:08,260
what's happening. What happened to the little girl? What was that? Who puts me down? Gets a big fat

712
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:44,069
bonus. Really? I don't think that's. Okay, hold on. Itchy mouth. Where should I go?

713
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:52,659
What the fuck? What are you doing? Stop running into explosives. I'm doing really well this game

714
02:44:52,659 --> 02:44:56,979
with the shotgun. This is a gameplay. This is a good thing I'm recording because this is going

715
02:44:56,979 --> 02:45:13,670
up on the main channel. This is going to be a big commentary about how I fucking 104 best gameplay

716
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:24,659
I've ever put up. Keep this up. I need ammo for that. Can I get rid of this? This gun sucks.

717
02:45:33,299 --> 02:45:38,420
Okay. What do I want to swap? Yeah. Give me. Why the hell would I use a pistol for? It's stupid.

718
02:45:39,059 --> 02:45:52,440
What is this doing? Oh, shut off the gas leak. Okay. Do it. Chat demands it. Do demand what?

719
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:18,889
Do a game. Game. Oh, all right. Hold on. Oh, you motherfucker. No. Okay. I'm fine.

720
02:46:18,889 --> 02:46:37,239
How long is this game even? I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

721
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:47,299
You ready? Here we go. Hey, what's going on, everybody? Gerber here with another Team Fortress

722
02:46:47,299 --> 02:46:53,319
2 gameplay commentary. And tonight, gotta be playing in fucking 10 years ago. There it is.

723
02:46:53,319 --> 02:46:56,760
Finally. He did it. I'm not doing that ever again. It's the last time you'll ever hear me say those

724
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:46,790
words. Stop standing up. Talking about sticky keys. Okay. Can I leave? Uh-huh. No. No. You.

725
02:47:46,870 --> 02:48:07,219
Stop. How do I get by that? Stop. No, I wanted to do that. It's what it feels like to be an

726
02:48:07,219 --> 02:48:24,600
NPC in this game. You suck. I'm fine. Find a way out. Okay. Do another joke. Okay. Fine. All

727
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:27,959
right. All right. Just give me a second. I gotta find like a swamp creature or something in here.

728
02:48:27,959 --> 02:48:32,010
There's gotta be like a swamp monster I can say yell at or something, right?

729
02:48:33,059 --> 02:48:46,569
Do one. Just wait a minute. All right. Here she comes. That's what you're using to hold the

730
02:48:46,569 --> 02:48:57,399
papers down? Like, get a filing cabinet. Why is this like a caveman? Like, a caveman works

731
02:48:57,399 --> 02:49:06,040
in the office? Like, put this in a filing cabinet. Use big rock. Keep papers done.

732
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:15,700
Chunggo, can you please put those in the filing cabinet? Filing cabinet. Scary. Make loud noise

733
02:49:15,700 --> 02:49:21,940
when open door. That's just, the wheels are a little, we'll put some WD-40 on it. Remind me of

734
02:49:21,940 --> 02:50:01,139
Giant Bird. Okay. Someone else will read it. Chunggo. Scary! That actually was scarier. Fake?

735
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:16,860
Yeah, and like, very overdone. This little guy from Overwatch. This is Arm. He builds a century

736
02:50:16,860 --> 02:50:39,340
Torbjorn. This is Arm, right? How do I get this open? It wasn't minus two, minus two, whatever.

737
02:50:39,899 --> 02:50:53,530
He said make a joke. He didn't say make a good one. That wasn't clear. Um, is this something I

738
02:50:53,530 --> 02:51:01,979
can press in here or activate? Why is the chat adding and subtracting? Well, they're trying to

739
02:51:01,979 --> 02:51:11,670
tell me how good or bad I am doing streaming. That's pretty much what it is. It's a point system.

740
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:18,840
If I say something that's not funny, they take points away from me, which makes me very upset.

741
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:26,659
But if they like what I say, they add points, which makes me very happy. New viewer song.

742
02:51:26,819 --> 02:51:31,459
Welcome to the channel. I'm not, I hate, I'll clear that. I'm not doing this. I'm not going to do that

743
02:51:31,459 --> 02:51:42,549
anymore. I'm not going to be like the guy with the sound board that makes fucking sound. Where do I

744
02:51:42,549 --> 02:52:08,379
go? I have to get this open somehow. Be that guy, please. Live your dreams. Get off me. Hey, get away

745
02:52:08,379 --> 02:52:46,520
from me. Nice gameplay. Don't play me. Oh, the little dog golem guys are here. Data. Now she's

746
02:52:46,520 --> 02:53:10,200
drawn to me. Coveter. You are coveted. Okay. But does it have to be an anime convention? I feel

747
02:53:10,200 --> 02:53:25,450
like that would be like if I was just sitting in my room and I smelled that I would want it.

748
02:53:25,450 --> 02:53:28,969
Like if we get the doctor in the doctor's office and if I smelled pizza, I'm going to be like,

749
02:53:28,969 --> 02:53:36,250
holy shit, doc, you got pizza in here? Yeah. Would you want a slice? Of course. Like it doesn't matter

750
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:52,889
where you are. Okay. Imagine you went for like just a routine checkup for the doctor and they came in

751
02:53:53,690 --> 02:54:03,319
with like a little paper plate and a slice of pizza on it. And they were like, you want this?

752
02:54:03,879 --> 02:54:11,350
I would eat it. I'd be like, all right, well, a doctor is giving this to me. I would definitely

753
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:16,059
eat it. Like if this was a random person on the street and they were just like, hey, you want a

754
02:54:16,059 --> 02:54:20,059
slice of pizza? No, I don't know what the fuck you are. Get away from me. You're just a random

755
02:54:20,059 --> 02:54:24,389
person. I don't know. You might be a doctor. I don't know. If a doctor is handing you a slice

756
02:54:24,389 --> 02:54:31,530
of pizza, it's probably going to be okay. At least that's what I would think. He's already

757
02:54:31,530 --> 02:54:41,100
examined it to make sure there's no, like nothing on it, nothing wrong with it. It's actually the

758
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:48,489
only way American doctors could administer. Wait, what? I didn't even say what you said.

759
02:54:48,489 --> 02:55:04,620
All right. So how do I get in here? It has drugs in it. I just, what did I just turn on?

760
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:11,059
Something upstairs? I don't see a door over here. I hear lots of, I hear lots of mouth noises.

761
02:55:11,620 --> 02:56:02,979
All right. I think it's up. It's just chat's mouth breathing. Not a big deal. We're fine. Get

762
02:56:02,979 --> 02:56:15,510
away. It was sushi here at her. Now I want pizza. Oh yeah, guys. All right. Let's break this down.

763
02:56:16,329 --> 02:56:20,840
Where am I? Where am I getting pizza from? Where should I get pizza from? What's like a pizza place

764
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:33,020
that you guys love? Get the whopper. I'll do that tomorrow. I promise I will do that tomorrow.

765
02:56:39,100 --> 02:56:46,629
That's happening to on tomorrow's stream. I promise. What the hell are they doing to this guy?

766
02:56:47,350 --> 02:57:30,680
That didn't kill you. How? This does not look comfortable. Um, that guy, his head just snaked

767
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:58,819
around. I don't think so. Get out of here. Oh, is he dead? Oh, that's not, that's bad. Oh, get

768
02:57:58,819 --> 02:58:07,530
him down. I have to like blows. I have to blow them up. That didn't even work. Whatever. Okay.

769
02:58:07,530 --> 02:58:37,430
Um, okay. So what do I do now? Just go up. Okay. Just order from a pizza place. It'll be 20 times

770
02:58:37,430 --> 02:59:23,780
better than the main chains. I hear dog. Oh, don't run. What? They fucking good calzones water. What

771
02:59:23,780 --> 02:59:27,940
is it? What is, what is water street pizzeria? Water street pizzeria. I don't even know what

772
02:59:27,940 --> 02:59:36,090
that, what the fuck is that? They have really good council. I don't know what that is. Or please go

773
02:59:36,090 --> 02:59:48,100
to Freddy Fazbear's. That's not a real place. I think they're chasing me down the stairs.

774
02:59:50,260 --> 03:00:01,659
Nope. Chuck E cheese. I actually could go for a Chuck E cheese pizza right now. That's weird

775
03:00:01,659 --> 03:00:05,180
for me to say, but I don't even care. People are like, Oh man, Chuck E cheese pizza. It's so gross.

776
03:00:05,180 --> 03:00:09,020
You know, do you hear that they like take pizza from other pizzas and put it in making a new pizza

777
03:00:09,020 --> 03:00:16,459
and serve it to you? I don't care. I don't even care. I'll just give me that one. I could eat a

778
03:00:16,459 --> 03:00:38,739
Chuck E cheese pizza right now. The whole thing. Why am I on fire? What do a pizza eating stream?

779
03:00:38,739 --> 03:00:42,739
I would, I would, I would cut it. I'd get like one of those big pizza knives and just go,

780
03:00:44,870 --> 03:00:49,030
I would actually ask the restaurant. I'd say, Hey, can you make me a pizza? Don't cut it though.

781
03:00:49,030 --> 03:00:55,020
I want to cut it. Just give me the big circle with just the cheese and everything. I want to

782
03:00:55,020 --> 03:01:00,420
be the one to cut it because I want to have to go like and put my hand down on the knife and go

783
03:01:00,420 --> 03:01:16,260
like down. That's what I want. I'm so hungry now. What do I do? Damn it. I'm so hungry. I'm going

784
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:27,989
to have to get a streamer snack. I'm going to have to get a streamer snack. Hey, I'm on here.

785
03:01:32,739 --> 03:01:40,569
Get out of here. What are you doing? I need a streamer snack. I need one right now.

786
03:01:40,569 --> 03:01:50,260
All right. I'm going to get a streamer snack. Everybody relax. That was weird. How did you open

787
03:01:50,260 --> 03:02:03,739
the door? Where the fuck did you come from? Did you just drink a bunch of stuff? This is like in

788
03:02:03,739 --> 03:02:17,510
gremlins when they're just drinking all the potions in the scientist room. Would you wink

789
03:02:17,510 --> 03:02:29,110
for us for a streamer snack? No, I'm just going to get some food. I'll be back. All right. Streamer

790
03:02:29,110 --> 03:05:49,700
snack time. I'll be right back. I got some really, really bad news. I don't have any more

791
03:05:50,920 --> 03:06:05,479
jerky sticks. I got to eat. I got to eat almonds. I got to get more jerky sticks. It's like my

792
03:06:05,479 --> 03:06:15,959
favorite. I'm just going to eat almonds until I can't breathe anymore. I'm going to fill my

793
03:06:15,959 --> 03:06:27,049
body with almonds. It's not funny about almonds. They were the most calorically dense snack.

794
03:06:27,049 --> 03:06:32,489
They got a good amount of protein. They've got a ton of calories and they're really good for you.

795
03:06:32,489 --> 03:06:40,360
If you really want to get filled up, have some almonds. I just fucking dropped a bunch of them

796
03:06:40,360 --> 03:06:55,239
all over the ground. God, it's not a good streamer snack though. Plus, this is such a bad streamer

797
03:06:55,239 --> 03:07:03,190
snack. What was I thinking? These are wasabi and soy sauce almonds and they have a film on them

798
03:07:03,190 --> 03:07:20,629
and it's going to get all over my hands. Look at it. It's already happening. They have this

799
03:07:20,629 --> 03:07:31,780
Cheeto dust on them. I fucking hate when people watch me eat. I just picked up two of them and

800
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:38,040
now I can't even play the game anymore. I don't want to put my hands in my mouth because somebody

801
03:07:38,040 --> 03:07:42,440
will clip it and they'll enhance it and they'll make it huge and they'll use it somewhere. I don't

802
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:52,950
want you to do that. Look, this is ridiculous. I just took another handful out. This is ridiculous.

803
03:07:52,950 --> 03:08:12,299
That's ridiculous. It's all over my hands too. I need a strategy. What's the strategy here?

804
03:08:12,299 --> 03:08:29,180
You didn't see that. Use a fork and knife? A fork and knife. A fork and Nike. Yeah, you hold it with

805
03:08:29,180 --> 03:08:36,659
the fork and step on it and it'll grind it up and you can eat it. Hold on, give me a second.

806
03:08:36,659 --> 03:09:01,979
Pour them into a cup. Wow, you're a fucking genius. Too late. Too late. Who goes over there?

807
03:09:01,979 --> 03:09:29,079
Good dog. All right, one more handful and I'll play. You hear how crunchy these are? I don't want

808
03:09:29,079 --> 03:09:44,569
it to pick up on the mic. I'm trying to make it not happen. Almonds taste like shit. What do you

809
03:09:44,569 --> 03:09:54,899
think tastes good? If you don't like a roasted salted almond, what tastes good to you? If that

810
03:09:54,899 --> 03:10:05,930
person writes, well, you know, acid, battery acid, oil, like car oil, dog food. Like, okay, well,

811
03:10:05,930 --> 03:10:18,379
I get it. That's why almonds have cyanide in them. Good. How much cyanide are in these? How much

812
03:10:18,379 --> 03:10:37,719
cyanide? Tell me. Tell me about the cyanide. Delicious cyanide. I feel not good.

813
03:12:17,459 --> 03:12:49,049
Did you guys hear the crunch? Auto slug. I feel so much better. I just took in like 700 calories

814
03:12:49,049 --> 03:13:08,790
in almonds. I may as well turn on fucking superpowers. No pizza? Later. It's already

815
03:13:08,790 --> 03:14:08,840
fucking greasy on here. Where do I go? Can you make an Overwatch reference? Sure. I can't do

816
03:14:08,840 --> 03:14:15,219
anything yet. All these bird seeds are gonna come out of my mouth and people are gonna be disgusted.

817
03:14:15,219 --> 03:14:45,930
I can't do anything yet. I didn't even get a drink either. What a fucking amateur. I can't

818
03:14:45,930 --> 03:14:57,290
shoot through like the chain link fence. Okay, that was delayed. Healing potion. Healing potion.

819
03:14:57,290 --> 03:15:16,020
Get them. Look, it is desynced. I'm still eating these. It's taking forever. I promise I have teeth.

820
03:15:16,020 --> 03:15:43,639
This is different. Boss fight. Boss fight. Washing his hand? Washing his hands with gloves on?

821
03:15:43,639 --> 03:16:34,979
He just ate these almonds. I want a couple more. No, I can't talk. Almonds. Let's go. Look at this

822
03:16:34,979 --> 03:17:02,379
paintball arena. I wonder what happens here. What are you gonna do? Nut tear list? I already did it.

823
03:17:02,379 --> 03:17:08,340
All right. Here we go. Let's go. Fight. Fight. Fight. He's gonna show up. He's gonna

824
03:17:08,340 --> 03:17:17,590
come down. Defeat the replica soldiers. Imagine seeing that when you open up the fucking thing.

825
03:17:28,680 --> 03:17:37,129
Nut tear list. I already did one. I did it already. I think I put um... What was number one? I actually

826
03:17:37,129 --> 03:18:01,260
don't remember. What did I put at number one? What was it? Ow. I have no grenades, huh?

827
03:18:01,979 --> 03:18:22,840
It was boppities. Yeah, I know. I remember. I remember that. Boppities. So is he controlling

828
03:18:22,840 --> 03:18:59,110
this? Is this the AI director? Oh boy. It's like a second delay. Actual delay. There's no delay.

829
03:19:01,850 --> 03:19:09,079
I'm not an idiot. You can't pull a fast one on me. I'm sorry. It's not gonna work.

830
03:19:09,079 --> 03:19:35,340
Show me the clip. Show it to me. Not that one. What was that? You just kicked me like...

831
03:19:36,059 --> 03:19:51,459
What was that? You just kicked me like... What am I looking at here? What was that? You just

832
03:19:51,459 --> 03:20:12,180
kicked me like... What was that? You just kicked me like... What was that? I don't get it. That was

833
03:20:12,180 --> 03:20:34,889
matched up fine. There's nothing coming out of that one. What the fuck? When that thing fell,

834
03:20:34,889 --> 03:20:38,409
was that somebody in there? It's like a guy in the porta potty and it tipped over.

835
03:20:39,909 --> 03:20:43,350
Please help. It stinks in here. Get me out of the fucking porta potty.

836
03:20:44,149 --> 03:20:52,809
No, it's one of those porta potties. It was at a goddamn outdoor live concert.

837
03:20:53,850 --> 03:21:16,469
What's going on? Did I win? I won. Shoot and make a noise at the same time.

838
03:21:17,110 --> 03:21:31,379
Oh. She's clipping that to me right now. Do it right now. I want to see it right now.

839
03:21:34,309 --> 03:21:45,059
What I just did. I want to see it. Yeah. Somebody show that to me. Bullshit.

840
03:21:45,059 --> 03:21:56,600
No, this is not even the right clip. I want to see the one I just did. Not scary. This is not it.

841
03:21:56,600 --> 03:22:02,360
This is the wrong one. There it is. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me. Give me.

842
03:22:02,360 --> 03:22:09,979
Webcam is delayed. Yeah. You would know. All right. So here we go. And if anybody talks...

843
03:22:09,979 --> 03:22:14,780
After we watch this clip, if anybody talks about there being an audio delay,

844
03:22:14,780 --> 03:22:29,590
you're going to get timed out for 200 days. Okay. I'm glad we have an understanding. Find out.

845
03:22:29,590 --> 03:22:59,129
Let's find out. Shoot and make a noise at the same time.

846
03:23:09,239 --> 03:23:21,620
It's fine. What's wrong with it? I don't see the issue. Okay. Wait. You're talking about my...

847
03:23:22,819 --> 03:23:33,000
The FPS is a little slower. The video is not delayed. It's like a 20 FPS because the camera

848
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:51,129
sucks. Here. Ready? Let's see if I can fix this. I don't think you guys even really care either.

849
03:23:51,129 --> 03:23:55,290
I feel like this is just a way to get me to stop playing the game and do something else

850
03:23:55,290 --> 03:24:50,059
to like fucking burn time. How's this? That's better, right? Better. Fixed. It's just the FPS.

851
03:24:50,059 --> 03:24:54,540
I turned the FPS up. I wanted to slow the FPS down because I got a 1080 and my 1080 sucks

852
03:24:54,540 --> 03:24:59,420
and it's burning out. It smells like burning plastic in here. I know it doesn't. I'm kidding.

853
03:25:01,909 --> 03:25:13,510
All right. Seeing the national anthem to prove it's fixed.

854
03:25:19,579 --> 03:25:29,959
Oh, you joker. All right. Let's go. How do I leave? One of these open? Can I go down?

855
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:32,840
The one that fell over, right? Can I go down one of these?

856
03:25:33,719 --> 03:25:46,540
Is there a door opener? Am I missing something? There we go. National anthem. Oh my god.

857
03:25:48,360 --> 03:25:59,559
Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed

858
03:26:00,360 --> 03:26:08,440
At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars

859
03:26:09,159 --> 03:26:20,840
Through the perilous night O'er the ramparts we waved

860
03:26:21,799 --> 03:26:31,799
At the twilight's last gleaming And its red glare

861
03:26:38,280 --> 03:26:46,200
The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night

862
03:26:47,079 --> 03:27:01,540
That our flag was still there. Oh, shit. Oh, say does that star

863
03:27:02,659 --> 03:27:13,450
I have ADHD. I can't complete it. You know how hard it is to sing the national anthem

864
03:27:13,450 --> 03:27:20,219
like in front of people. I get it now. You know, people just like I was coming out of the bathroom.

865
03:27:20,219 --> 03:27:23,500
You know how people like just they mess it up all and it's like, well, how did you mess that up?

866
03:27:24,379 --> 03:27:27,739
It's actually like when you're in front of a bunch of people you have to like kind of remember

867
03:27:29,020 --> 03:27:34,059
and there's like two major breaks in the national anthem that you think it's going to be when the

868
03:27:34,059 --> 03:27:44,139
rocket's red glare but it's not that point yet and you get caught you're like oh there's another

869
03:27:44,139 --> 03:28:05,540
verse right shit what about canada sure oh canada our hearts and sacred lands shrews

1115
04:38:42,700 --> 04:38:52,009
then they like didn't they outsource fear two and fear three what was the point of having what was

1116
04:38:52,009 --> 04:39:17,110
the point of that how would you outsource the next two games in the franchise you made yeah i think i

1117
04:39:17,110 --> 04:39:22,330
like this studio though i think this is a really good studio this is the um the guys that made uh

1118
04:39:22,330 --> 04:39:28,599
the lord of the rings games the shadow of war and um what was it the other one nothing else of war

1119
