57
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,700
proud of the work we've done to help you feel comfortable in your new life oh yes in fact if

58
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,399
you want you can you can even experience the seasons the same way you're used to them what

59
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:30,580
i mean is we have islands in both the northern and southern hemisphere the village is going to

60
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,129
throw a birthday party for you on july 4th that's all right it's the fourth of july we're going to

61
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:40,070
have a party anyways we recommend choosing an island that has the same seasonal pattern as your

62
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:49,529
current home current home why the fuck am i doing that so tell me jeremy where do you live now i

63
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:55,850
live in north america ah excellent that information really helps us focus on just the right island for

64
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,419
you naturally we'd recommend that you relocate to an island in the northern hemisphere there are

65
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:07,240
a few more decisions to make but does that sound okay to you so far so far oh okay if i do that

66
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,299
again i want i want everyone to leave if i do that again everyone leave watch another stream if i do

67
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:26,580
that again okay here we go there are a few inches should i go to southern hemisphere uh no i want

68
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,769
to stay here we have a number of lovely uninhabited islands in the northern hemisphere to choose from

69
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:38,169
now then all of our islands are approximately the same size and they're all quite natural

70
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,850
but don't worry about whether you'll have enough space or comfort you can't go wrong

71
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,929
just follow your instincts and choose an island with a layout that looks appealing that's how i

72
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:51,860
do it oh look at how cute this is i'll show you some maps now and you can choose the best one

73
00:10:51,860 --> 00:11:18,870
for your new home um okay which one do i want a penis one um these okay these all could be

74
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:27,559

75
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,440

76
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,960
talking about i'm going i'm going to go with the one that you that could there's no way

77
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,440

okay i gotta and i gotta stop being like a fucking weirdo because like this is animal crossing this

209
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,430
is a game that came out within the last week the first time i played a new game in probably a year

210
00:30:56,069 --> 00:31:01,079
this is the first game time i played a game that came out after 2006 and probably like a year and

211
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,900
a half um so they're probably just going to be coming looking for animal crossing gameplay and

212
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,740
like i'm fucked up so i'm going to like tone it down a little bit from here on out

213
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:20,150
all right everyone let's get to it literally yesterday city skylines came out in like 2007

214
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:27,460
when did it come out 2010 would you come see me for a moment well i could walk up there what

215
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:36,549
are you like a judge oh jeremy i just wanted to go over what we'll need for the campfire

216
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:41,269
i think roughly 10 tree branches to do the trick and find them scattered about the island

217
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,509
when you find one lying in the ground press y to pick it up we will i'll investigate the peach

218
00:31:49,509 --> 00:32:04,380
like items growing in the trees i suspect they're real peaches how did you get to the top oh any

219
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,940
tree branches you find on the ground or shake out of the trees will work just fine come on it

220
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:31,559
yep i just want to make sure i have these first quest free branch got it one two three four five

221
00:32:33,529 --> 00:33:00,700
rock give it to me take the trees wow six seven eight nine ten done i get it should i click the

222
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:10,740
peaches and stuff or no i got them welcome back i trust you had some success foraging for tree

223
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:18,180
branches very well allow me to lighten your load yes that should be plenty for our campfire you

224
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,180
made quick work of that i'm quite glad that i'll be sharing this desolate island with such a hard

225
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,170
worker oh ho i think if you're surviving on a desolate island our next task is to run up

226
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,930
something to snack on while you were collecting branches i was evaluating the fruit that seems

227
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,170
to be abundant here they look like peaches they smell like peaches and they even taste like peaches

228
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,289
in fact they are 100 without a doubt genuine peaches so will you collect six of them for me

229
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,039
if you see a tree growing peaches you can press a to shake it and then pick up the fruit

230
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,279
i need peaches for us in no time we're gonna sit at a campfire and eat peaches

231
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:05,900
this is such a great saturday morning children's cartoon i can't wait that is the perfect quest

232
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:26,469

240
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:34,489
ventures and endeavors over the years but this may be the most exciting helping develop a thriving

241
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:40,090
new community entirely from scratch will truly test my business acumen okay now please if you

242
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:45,050
would pass this chalice around and drink from the blood and it's like you have to pass it around a

243
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:53,460
fucking blood chalice and perhaps my skills as an outdoorsman now we may not have the kind of

244
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,119
numbers that i originally envisioned that just means we'll have to rise to the challenge and

245
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,360
i have no doubt that with hard work and perseverance we'll shape this deserted island into

246
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,280
i suppose we can't call this a deserted island anymore what would should we call it

247
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:20,760
i just rang the back of his head and well that was weird i sense a great opportunity

248
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,719
as the first residence this island we should be the ones to name it

249
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,059
and in the spirit of democracy we should put it to evoke majority rules i told you this is my

250
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:42,139
competition you guys didn't say so present your ideas just a name for the island uh about um

728
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:49,369

1047
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:17,319
websites where you could redeem points for shit it was like 500 million points like an ipad oh

1048
03:34:17,319 --> 03:34:22,440
i want to ask something uh i saw something on tv about this website where you can buy like tvs for

1049
03:34:22,440 --> 03:34:27,639
like five cents and shit they were like auction weird like fucked up website where it's like i

1050
03:34:27,639 --> 03:34:36,180
got this plasma tv for 98 percent off how does how does that work how is that even possible it's

1051
03:34:36,180 --> 03:34:50,659
just a way it can't be real it's like i got this i i got this ipad pro for only three dollars it's

1052
03:34:50,659 --> 03:35:02,170
just like a weird penny auction sites you have to you pay regardless if you win you're the one you're

1053
03:35:02,170 --> 03:35:13,750
the 10,000th person to log in you don't actually pay three dollars you pay for bids so wait so if

1054
03:35:13,750 --> 03:35:26,840
i pay like 50 dollars to bid three cents then i won a you pay to bid so i i pay a hundred dollars

1055
03:35:26,840 --> 03:35:41,799
to bid 10 cents on this ipad pro so if i bid five times i paid for the ipad pro why would anyone

1056
03:35:41,799 --> 03:35:54,280
ever ever do that for any reason can you actually get something for like a dollar it's impossible

1057
03:35:54,280 --> 03:36:03,079
it's just gambling they take your bid even if you fail to win i was so confused i was like how does

1058
03:36:03,079 --> 03:36:13,829
it make any fucking sense because idiots like you aren't sure if it's real what hold on whoa hit the
