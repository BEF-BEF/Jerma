1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:24,899
It's the end of a year, and the beginning of a new adventure. Welcome everyone, to Turma Rumble 3. Excitement, awe, and inspiring motions will get you on your feet tonight, I can promise you that.

2
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:33,899
But before we get started, please join me in a moment of silence to remember all those wrestlers who we lost this past year.

3
00:00:33,899 --> 00:01:43,390
And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you could please rise and welcome Grandpa to sing our national anthem.

4
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:58,810
Oh, say can you see, by the drop of my smokey, my poor meatball, bursting in air, bursting in air.

5
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,810
Turn on my mic!

6
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,810
Turn my mic on! Grandpa! Oh no, that's Demon Lord Zaraxos, ladies and gentlemen. I can't even, he's got a chocolate!

7
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,810
Whoa! He just did, just fire underneath that ring.

8
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:21,979
Okay, um, hey everybody, welcome to Turma Rumble 3. I'm Turma. While I try to compose myself after what just happened, Sonic the Hedgehog is now coming down to the ring.

9
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,539
He's supposed to come in 16th. What the fuck is going on?

10
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:34,780
I'm gonna have to do some jumbling around of the scheduler and see who's coming in next, but anyways, visibly drunk and spitting at people in the audience is Sonic the Hedgehog.

11
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Look, we get it. We know Sonic Boom wasn't a good success. We know that Germania 2014, you lost, but that is no excuse for this type of behavior.

12
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,780
Get your act together. Please ring that bell. Let's start Turma Rumble 3. My god.

13
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,400
No, he's uh, he's dead.

14
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Uh, that's the second person Zaraxos has killed in two minutes.

15
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:07,639
And, uh, I carried the button. We started, guys. We have started two or three minutes ago, so that means another contestant has to come down to the arena.

16
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:14,639
And we'll get this guy introduced as quickly as possible. This is Turtimus the Adolescent Warrior, and he's got a task ahead of him.

17
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,639
If he's going to be number three, that's gonna die, and he's gonna show off for the cameras a little bit here.

18
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:26,639
If he is number three to die in a row by Demon Lord Zaraxos, I really don't know what to say. I'm not exactly sure how we're going to continue the rumble,

19
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:33,639
but Turtimus, if Master Splintoad has taught you anything at all, please use it immediately.

20
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,650
Because it would be bad if Demon Lord Zaraxos just eliminated himself.

21
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,960
Why? What? What?

22
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,610
I have no idea why that just happened.

23
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,610
But regardless, we have to send another person in prematurely, so whoever is next on the list, send them on out here.

24
00:03:52,610 --> 00:04:00,909
And it's gonna be, ladies and gentlemen, it's a good one, it's the 1997 Boston Celtics Champion, Frank Pizza,

25
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:06,909
running down here with his patented, I have a dump in my pants run. Here he comes, and let's get started.

26
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:10,909
Welcome to actual wrestlers in the ring now.

27
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:17,910
We're going to actually talk about technical rasslin', rather than people just instantly dying when they come into the ring.

28
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,910
Turtimus, the teenage adolescent mutant warrior, or whatever, what did I call him? Something like that.

29
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,910
And Frank Pizza of the Boston Celtics, wearing his 1997 authentic championship jersey.

30
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,910
Turtimus was looking for a early elimination there, but cannot even get him over the first turnbuckle.

31
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,910
Well, Frank Pizza's now hanging on the ice, reverse elbow, and a flying shoulder tackle onto Turtimus for his troubles.

32
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,910
But Frank Pizza gets his leg caught, gets spun around on his back, and here comes another contestant.

33
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:52,089
If you forget how this works, every minute or so, another competitor is going to come down, and here comes a familiar face indeed.

34
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:59,089
You had to have thought that after Captain Crunch's victory at Germania 2014, we'd see more serial characters.

35
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,459
And here's Count Chocula, coming down to the German arena for the first time ever.

36
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:08,870
And unfortunately, his serial leg doesn't even exist anymore.

37
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,110
You can only get Count Chocula on Halloween. That's how much this guy sucks.

38
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,110
But he's in the German Rumble for the first time ever.

39
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,480
Let's see if he's got any tricks up his sleeve, besides, of course, turning your milk into chocolate milk.

40
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,480
And it's not even really chocolate milk. It's like a weird inside of a dog's ass chocolate milk.

41
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
It tastes like it's just like sugar. It's all right.

42
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Look, I'm not going to blast Count Chocula, because I used to eat it every other day when I was a kid.

43
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,480
I'd eat Captain Crunch. I'd eat Count Chocula. I'd eat like Boo Berry. All these old cereals.

44
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I ate them all when I was younger, so I can't be biased against any of them.

45
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,480
But we got another contestant coming in right now.

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,910
Confidently walking down to the arena is everybody's favorite shit character.

47
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,980
It is none other than Gabe, the Glueman Dick Rossi.

48
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Fireworks. I don't know why he bought fireworks.

49
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,980
He spent like 60 bucks for no reason, because nobody cares.

50
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,350
Nobody cares about you, Glueman. Just get in here and win for fucking once in your life.

51
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,350
Four people in the arena. Now we get Glueman, Captain Crunch.

52
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,350
Oh, I almost just said Captain Crunch. That's Count Chocula. Get your cereals right.

53
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,350
That's Count Chocula, Glueman, Frank Pizza, and Turtimus the Teenage Warrior.

54
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,350
No eliminations whatsoever. Not yet, at least.

55
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,769
And pay attention to the left side of your screen right now.

56
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:30,769
Gabe, the Glueman Dick Rossi, and Frank Pizza, former teammates on the Celtics, are fighting right now for some reason.

57
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,769
Turtimus is gone. Turtimus has just been eliminated from the competition by Count Chocula.

58
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,769
And Glueman now. Glueman looks like he just got in.

59
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,769
That would be a terribly sad story if Frank Pizza and Count Chocula try to help.

60
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,769
He doesn't really...Count Chocula didn't do anything there, let's be honest.

61
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:47,769
Are they actually going to try to double-team Glueman out of here?

62
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,459
Another person coming down to the arena right now. Who's it going to be while they're tag-teaming Glueman?

63
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,019
That's Dick Dastardly Richard from the Rat Movie.

64
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,019
One of the most notorious gem thieves and artifact stealers.

65
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,019
This side of the Mississippi, folks. This is a dangerous man.

66
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,019
Keep your eye on him for the remainder of the Rumble, because frankly, he is terrifying.

67
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,699
And here he comes.

68
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,519
Surprisingly a lot bigger than I thought he was going to be.

69
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,519
I thought he was only going to be, like, five-five.

70
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,699
He's a...but how big is Count Chocula?

71
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,129
Isn't Count Chocula, like, three feet tall?

72
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,430
Well, no, Glueman's, like, six-something, I think, right? I have no idea.

73
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,430
All I know is that Frank Pizza just gave Glueman three or four punches,

74
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,430
and Glueman accidentally just slobber-knocked Count Chocula in the face.

75
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,430
He was going for Frank Pizza, but he ended up getting...

76
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,430
Well, then, Frank Pizza now gets a chin smash into a hip toss

77
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,430
and then into a flipping heel kick onto Frank Pizza.

78
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,430
Count Chocula is doing some work here.

79
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,430
Count Chocula and Glueman doing their respective work.

80
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,430
Frank Pizza looks like he could be on the verge here of getting eliminated.

81
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,430
So does Dick Dastardly Richard. No, gets the punch.

82
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,430
Is Captain Cork-Cocula...Cork-Cocula gets it. I said his name wrong.

83
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,430
Frank Pizza is now eliminated with a drop kick to his face over the ropes.

84
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,430
And we've got another contestant coming down to the arena.

85
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,430
It's the Candyman from Lethal League.

86
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,430
If you've never played Lethal League, in my opinion,

87
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,430
it is one of the best indie games of 2014.

88
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
I suggest you check it out. He is represented here for the first time ever.

89
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,430
Welcome, Candyman.

90
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,430
Without his cane that he typically uses,

91
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,430
and immediately goes for Dick Dastardly Richard, who throws him over the ropes.

92
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,430
Dick, could he immediately get eliminated for his first appearance in the German arena?

93
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,800
No. Dick Dastardly Richard with a very rare sign of empathy and sympathy there,

94
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,799
letting him get up. You don't technically see that ever by Dick.

95
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,799
And he could really suffer because of that.

96
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
He just gave him a little bit of sympathy.

97
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,799
You don't give that kind of sympathy to the Candyman.

98
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,799
Is Dick Dastardly Richard going out Candyman?

99
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,799
Cork-Cocula, how many fucking times am I going to miss?

100
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,799
For now, it's Cork-Cocula's name.

101
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,799
And just barely, just barely, he gets up.

102
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,799
Dick Dastardly Richard survives another day.

103
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,799
But is he going to, right after surviving that,

104
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,799
he's going to go, oh, we've got another contestant coming in right now.

105
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,799
And Dick Dastardly Richard vines.

106
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,799
I can't, I'm going to fucking change that name.

107
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,799
And here comes the Giant Rat.

108
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,799
That's the Giant Rat rolling his way down here.

109
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,799
Look at him go.

110
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,799
I've never seen such a huge rat in my entire life.

111
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,799
He definitely prays at night.

112
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,799
He definitely stalks at night.

113
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,799
You can tell by just by the way he looks.

114
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,799
And he's in the arena right now as Glooman is about to get,

115
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,799
he's going right by, what a ball dog by the Giant Rat.

116
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,799
And he is, me means business.

117
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,799
You've got to figure, he's definitely a top seed.

118
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,799
Ladies and gentlemen, if I were to say so myself,

119
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,799
the Giant Rat is now in along with Dick Dastardly Richard,

120
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,799
which makes it, no, he's gone.

121
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,799
Dick Richard is gone.

122
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,799
He has been eliminated.

123
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,799
Well, the Giant Rat and Count Chocula are trying to push Glooman out.

124
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,799
Are they going to Glock?

125
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,799
Glooman has been eliminated.

126
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,799
Glooman is out of the competition

127
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,799
per use of the Giant Rat

128
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,799
and Count Chocula.

129
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,799
What a terrible thing to see.

130
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,799
And we've got another person coming out almost immediately already.

131
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,799
It's crazy to me

132
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,799
how fast people come out in this game.

133
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,799
Has it really been like 30 to 60 seconds?

134
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,799
I feel like somebody just came in.

135
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,799
But whatever, sorry, because it's Earthworm Jim

136
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,799
showing off his dance moves.

137
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,799
He's ready, he's a veteran of the German Rumbles

138
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,799
and he's here to prove himself.

139
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,799
He's here to dance. He's here to point.

140
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,799
And he's here to win.

141
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,799
Welcome Earthworm Jim to the rumble.

142
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,799
As we've got Count Chocula patiently awaiting his arrival

143
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,799
while the Giant Rat and Candy Man are fighting in their own right.

144
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,799
And Earthworm Jim, right when he gets in,

145
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,799
does a headbutt to Count Chocula's stomach.

146
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,799
Would that even hurt?

147
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,980
Isn't Earthworm Jim a worm?

148
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,980
Is there any bones? I don't think worms don't even have any bones, do they?

149
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,149
So I don't know why.

150
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,149
That would just kind of feel like squishy goo

151
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,149
pushing up against your stomach.

152
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,149
Anyways, we've got Count Chocula already.

153
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,149
Count Chocula just eliminated Earthworm Jim

154
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,149
with a clothesline over the top ropes.

155
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,149
Immediately when he gets in.

156
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,149
Oh, I had high hopes for you, Earthworm Jim.

157
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,149
Every time you get screwed.

158
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,149
And Candy Man, speaking of people getting screwed,

159
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,149
Candy Man now looks like he can, no, he's going to stay in.

160
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,149
He is going to get rid of that double team

161
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,149
while we have another person coming in.

162
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,149
He just throws over the giant rat, which is surprising

163
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,149
because he is a top seed.

164
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,149
Count Chocula lining up the big boot!

165
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:00,330
And he's gone! And here comes the mime!

166
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,580
You know, every Jerma Rumble

167
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,580
we visit a thing where

168
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,580
he's the shit character.

169
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
You know how there's always the worst character

170
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
that's made? This is the one.

171
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,820
But here he comes, he jumps over the top ropes.

172
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
There are only three people in the

173
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
ring at the moment. You've got Count Chocula,

174
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,309
Candy Man, and now the mime. What's that?

175
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:24,070
Are you serious?

176
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,070
As I'm getting word right now, we're going to be joined

177
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,070
at ringside right now

178
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,070
by Demon Lord Zaraxos at the commentary table.

179
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,309
Okay, I don't know.

180
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,549
Okay.

181
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,549
We're going to have to get another seed over here so we can move

182
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:38,549
a couple things while the action

183
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:40,549
is still going on. I want to be able to still cast the game.

184
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,549
But ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

185
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,549
Demon Lord Zaraxos.

186
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:46,549
Once you have a seat, we pulled a chair up here for you.

187
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:48,549
Please tell us what's on your mind,

188
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,730
I guess.

189
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,730
Man, I was fucking bored back there.

190
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,730
Alright, I don't want to cut you off,

191
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,730
but we do have another entrant to come in, Demon Lord.

192
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,730
It is a 90's icon.

193
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,730
You know him as the Slim Jim Guy.

194
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,730
Snap into a Slim Jim, oh yeah,

195
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,730
baby. Here he is.

196
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Making his first ever appearance. The Slim Jim Guy is in this?

197
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,610
Yeah.

198
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,610
I hate this guy.

199
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,610
I've had a feud with this guy for the last like

200
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,909
2,000 years.

201
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,909
You've had a feud with the Slim Jim Guy for

202
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,909
two... That doesn't make any... I'm going to move on.

203
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,909
So, we have Slim Jim Guy

204
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,909
coming in. You really threw me off there, dude.

205
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,909
We have Slim Jim Guy coming in. We have the Mime,

206
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,909
Count Chocula, and Candyman

207
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,909
now, all fighting for

208
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,909
dominance in Jerma Rumble 3. Welcome, Slim Jim Guy.

209
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:33,909
And I guess while I have you

210
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,909
here, Zaraxos, I do have a couple of questions for you.

211
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:37,909
I'll get to those in a minute, but I do want to

212
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,909
focus on what's going on in the ring. We've got Slim Jim

213
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,909
now on the ropes, and a backhanded

214
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,909
slap to Candyman,

215
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,909
who is calling for time out right now

216
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,909
for some reason. People tend to do that.

217
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,909
Why do people call for time out in the middle

218
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:51,909
of a Royal Rumble? You're not going to get it.

219
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,909
There is no time out. What do you think there's a referee here?

220
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,909
And there goes Candyman! No, just barely.

221
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,909
Count Chocula almost eliminates him while

222
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:00,279
we have another contestant coming out. This

223
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,279
guy does not need an introduction.

224
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
He's the most miserable person on Earth.

225
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,279
Miserable, Mikey. And he's

226
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,279
all the way from the Quizney Channel, the most

227
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,279
miserable place on Earth. And

228
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,279
here he is, to show that he's ready

229
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,279
to take on everybody in the Jerma

230
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,519
Arena. He's huge, by the way. He's

231
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,820
like another giant rat. Anyways, now we're getting

232
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
a little crowded here as he goes for

233
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Count Chocula with a couple of swift elbows

234
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,820
to his face. Nearly takes

235
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
his skull off, his huge skull,

236
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,000
mind you. And now that we have sort of a second

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
here where I can ask you, Xeraxos, I have

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
one question, just one simple question.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What the hell was going on in the beginning

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
there? Why did you eliminate yourself?

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are you doing? You honestly think

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,299
I belong here? It just wasn't fair.

243
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,480
You're going to put like Candyman and

244
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Count Chocula versus me?

245
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm the lord of all hells. None of

246
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
these little dipshits can do anything against me.

247
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Why would I be in it? God, I fucking

248
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
hate the Slim Jim guy. You need to

249
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
calm down. Okay, you're seriously stressing

250
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
me out. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So we got another entrance

251
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
to do, guys. Another buzzer. That means number 12

252
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
is going to be coming in. And it's

253
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
you know him. You love him.

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,659
The egg is coming down

255
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,960
for the fourth time. You know,

256
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I am actually, I hate to say this,

257
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
but I actually am pleasantly surprised to see the egg.

258
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,259
I thought he was going to die or something. I thought he

259
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,259
would be one of the people in the beginning that was dead.

260
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:18,259
But no, he ends up being here. And

261
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:20,259
hopefully he goes far because he always

262
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,259
loses. So welcome egg to the German Rumble

263
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,259
and we've got a lot of stuff going on. Candyman

264
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,259
now is owing the ropes. He may

265
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,259
in fact, no, not going to get eliminated by Miserable Mikey.

266
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,259
I can't get over the fact that the

267
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,259
Slim Jim guy is in this. Will you

268
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,629
stop? I'm pissing me off. You need to stop

269
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:36,629
interrupting me. Okay, you're really derailing this

270
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:38,629
whole thing. I'm going back in. Fuck this guy. No, no, no, no.

271
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,629
You can't do that. Fucking Slim Jim guy. Zaraxos

272
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,629
no. Zaraxos.

273
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:44,629
Oh no, no, no, no. Don't do it.

274
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:47,059
Don't do it. No, we're going to get.

275
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:49,059
All right, get security. Get security.

276
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,059
Somebody call the fire department. Call security.

277
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,059
No, what do the Mayan have to do with

278
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,059
this? I'm not going to have this asshole

279
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,059
rule the whole German Rumble. There's another person dead.

280
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,059
Zaraxos is killing everybody in the

281
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,059
ring. Candyman, no. No, he's going

282
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,059
down. We need some help. The egg.

283
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,059
What the fuck egg? No, no, count Chocula.

284
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,059
All right, we need to get like the army

285
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:09,059
or something. How do you deal with the demon lord?

286
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,059
I have no idea. But somebody

287
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:13,059
has to get down there. Somebody has to stop this.

288
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:15,059
The egg and Mickey Mouse are

289
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,059
really starting. They're plotting who's

290
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,059
going to take on. You're not going to be able to take him on.

291
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,059
Are you crazy? I don't know what to do.

292
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:23,059
We're going to have to cancel the whole event, guys. I'm really

293
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,059
sorry about this. But wait a minute.

294
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,059
Who is that? Is that who

295
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,299
I think it is? That's Mr. Sneak Man.

296
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,299
It's me, Mr. Sneak Man.

297
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,299
Oh no.

298
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,299
No.

299
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,299
He came and he was trying to rescue this

300
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,299
event and he got stopped by

301
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:41,299
Demon Lord Zaraxos. This is just ridiculous

302
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:43,299
guys. And now Demon Lord can do whatever he

303
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:45,299
wants now. He cleared the ring pretty much.

304
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:47,299
And hold on a second.

305
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,299
Hold on a second.

306
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,299
Kitty, he's going to do it.

307
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,299
Through the table. Mr. Sneak Man

308
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,299
has just eliminated Demon Lord Zaraxos

309
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,299
and himself in the process.

310
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,299
Oh my God.

311
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,299
What have we just witnessed?

312
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:03,299
And also Bat Boy is, who fucking

313
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:05,299
cares about this guy? This guy sucks.

314
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,299
What really matters is Mr.

315
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,299
Sneak Man saves the

316
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,299
day and lets the rumble continue

317
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:13,299
sacrificing himself

318
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,299
for the greater good.

319
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,299
Thank you Mr. Sneak Man. Your

320
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,799
duty will not go unnoticed.

321
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,799
It seems like Zaraxos is very slow

322
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,799
to get up here. Needing the attention

323
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,799
of medical staff to bring him out.

324
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,980
I think he might have broken his leg on

325
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,149
that table. Yeah, he's pointing at his leg here.

326
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,149
Let's hope he does not recover

327
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,149
because fuck this guy. He ruined the whole rumble.

328
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,580
And after that entire ordeal

329
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
we are left with just three

330
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,580
competitors in the ring and what a shame

331
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,759
it is that it's these three

332
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,940
guys. You're telling me you couldn't have

333
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
chokeslammed Miserable Mikey into hell?

334
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,110
Like what is he still doing here?

335
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,110
You picked Count Chocula. He was doing

336
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,110
fantastic. Why would, now there's like three

337
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,110
dickheads in the ring. And now they're gonna

338
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,110
be double teaming. Now they're gonna do Miserable Mikey

339
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,110
holding the egg back while Bat Boy punches

340
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,110
him in the stomach and calling for time

341
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,110
out. It doesn't work. Stop calling time out.

342
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,109
It doesn't do it. Now Bat Boy is being held back by

343
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,109
the egg. These guys are idiots.

344
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,109
And now here comes the king

345
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,109
of all the idiots.

346
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,109
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your

347
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,109
hands together for the greatest

348
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,109
video game character to ever live.

349
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,109
I'm talking about Pac-Man.

350
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,109
Here he comes.

351
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,109
Coming in at number 14

352
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,109
to Jerma Rumble 3. And he's

353
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,109
got a great advantage. If you come in

354
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,109
in the last five or six you have such

355
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:31,109
a huge one up on

356
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,109
every other competitor that has come in

357
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:35,109
so far. He's refreshed.

358
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:37,109
He's naked and he's ready to go.

359
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,289
And his first order of business is to throw

360
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,289
Mikey over the ropes.

361
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,289
Not necessarily going for any

362
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:45,289
elimination while Bat Boy just did a roundhouse

363
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:47,289
kick and completely missed the egg.

364
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,289
I don't know if anybody saw that but I'm sure you did.

365
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,289
What a block by Pac-Man. One punch

366
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,289
and here comes the second. What a blast

367
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,289
to his face knocking him clean unconscious

368
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,289
while the egg is gonna get thrown over.

369
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,289
The egg has been eliminated by Bat

370
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,289
Boy. Embarrassing egg

371
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,289
hit the showers. You just got eliminated

372
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,289
by Bat Boy. And speaking of eliminations

373
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,289
we've got potentially Mikey

374
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,289
going over here by Pac-Man and Bat Boy. Is he gonna

375
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,289
go over? There holding up by his butt cheeks

376
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,289
and he doesn't go over just

377
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,289
barely. And here comes number 15.

378
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:17,460
All the way from your

379
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
neighborhood classroom. He's

380
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,460
here. He's primed. He's ready.

381
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
He's sharpened. He is.

382
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,089
The pencil.

383
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:28,259
First time ever seeing him in the

384
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,259
Jerma arena making his way down

385
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,259
really confident. He is stoked

386
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:34,259
to be here. He said he sharpened

387
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,259
his head to the point where he could stab

388
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,259
somebody through the heart and instantly

389
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,259
kill them. Let's hope he doesn't do that because that

390
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,259
would be terrible and we don't want to see any

391
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:44,259
more characters die at the hands

392
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,259
of somebody in this arena tonight.

393
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,259
Well Pac-Man gets a Larry by Mikey. Pac-Man has

394
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:50,500
been eliminated. And

395
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
look at this temper tantrum. He's starting to throw

396
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
at ringside right now. Usually a

397
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
pretty happy-go-lucky guy. Not

398
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
tonight though. Unfortunately

399
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Pac-Man you have to go home. I

400
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
don't even know where that is. And the pencil

401
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
could get eliminated as well. No pencil

402
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
still hangs on to a double

403
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
attempt at elimination.

404
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,049
And now it's back to three.

405
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,049
There has been three in the ring

406
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:15,049
for the last few minutes now. We have not

407
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,049
seen a crowded ring since Zaraxos

408
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,049
destroyed everyone.

409
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:21,049
But now we've got number 16

410
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,049
coming in while Batboy is just

411
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,049
looking back and forth like he's at a tennis match.

412
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,740
I'm not exactly sure what the hell he's doing.

413
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,039
And that's, that's Jerma.

414
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,349
Looks a little different. Has he lost

415
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:35,849
weight? Has he not been going to the gym?

416
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,539
I don't know. Does he?

417
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,539
Oh no. Here we go. Let's see a couple of push-ups by you Jerma.

418
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,539
Let's show everybody you can do them.

419
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,019
You did one. You did one. Okay.

420
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,319
Very good. Get in the ring.

421
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,319
Batboy is still just looking left and right

422
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,319
while Mikey is being pushed over the

423
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,319
ropes by the pencil. Is he gonna get it?

424
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,319
He's gonna get it! He just tossed Mikey

425
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,319
over. That's it. Mikey is gone. He was in there

426
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,319
for a little while. He survived. The

427
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,500
final survivor of the Zaraxos

428
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Tyrade has been eliminated.

429
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,799
And pay attention to these guys

430
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,799
that are in here right now everybody

431
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,799
because these three have a huge

432
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,799
percentage chance to win

433
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,799
the Jerma Rumble. There are only four

434
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,799
other contestants physically that are

435
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,799
going to come in and what a toss

436
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,799
by Batboy on the pencil.

437
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,799
I gotta say, we have seen some pretty

438
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,799
impressive moves by Batboy today.

439
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,799
I have talked a lot of shit about this guy

440
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,799
but he has done very well

441
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,799
with his time in the ring so far.

442
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,799
And what a block. What a reverse block by pencil

443
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,799
and a punch to the face by Jerma. Could we see Jerma get

444
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,799
eliminated? No, he reverses it and

445
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,799
tosses pencil into the corner there while we have

446
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,799
another person coming in at

447
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:42,099
number 17. Take a look

448
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:44,410
at this guy. Do you see the

449
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,410
intensity on that face? You can breathe

450
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,410
in the determination. He's looking for

451
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,410
redemption. Can you hear that roar?

452
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,410
That's Gabe Newell. Gabe

453
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,410
Newell is here at number 17.

454
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,410
The sailor of the ship.

455
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,410
The queen of Valve. The king of

456
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,410
Valve. He is everything. He is one.

457
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,410
He is the only Gabe Newell.

458
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,410
And you gotta figure shit is gonna hit

459
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,410
the fan when he gets in the ring here. He is

460
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,410
not happy with Jerma. What a duck by Jerma.

461
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,410
Gets him in a German suplex and throws him.

462
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,410
Unbelievable reversal there by Jerma.

463
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,410
Here comes the grudge match. TF2

464
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,410
community versus Valve. All the

465
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,410
shit that we talked about end of the line. It got

466
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,410
to Gabe Newell. He's pissed about it. What a punch.

467
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,410
And one, two, three. What

468
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,410
a series of combinations. Gabe Newell has

469
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,410
a vendetta and he is just

470
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,410
taking it out on Jerma's face right now.

471
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,410
Another right hand. Oh no he gets

472
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,410
a block. Gets a reversal here. Jerma going

473
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,410
for a wrist twist. It's not gonna happen.

474
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,410
Gabe Newell is running on pure adrenaline

475
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,410
right now. Tosses Jerma over the ropes.

476
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,410
Are we gonna see an elimination? Gabe

477
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,410
Newell is going to eliminate Jerma.

478
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,410
He's gone. Gabe Newell is cheering

479
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,410
into the crowd right now of his elimination

480
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,410
of Jerma. And we have another person

481
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,410
to call in. What a series of

482
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,410
events that just was.

483
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,410
I seriously can't believe

484
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,410
that Gabe Newell just came in and kicked the

485
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,650
shit out of me. Like he went right

486
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,650
for me. I didn't program that.

487
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,650
That like happened. He just beat the absolute bag

488
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,650
out of me and then threw me out.

489
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,650
I didn't script that. Anyways

490
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,650
here comes Abierre. And he's gonna go

491
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,650
right for Gabe Newell. Gabe Newell spins him around

492
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,650
and slams him on his back while the pencil

493
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,650
almost falls out of the ring

494
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,650
after being tossed over by Batboy

495
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,650
who still I can't believe is in it.

496
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,650
I cannot believe this. Guys

497
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,650
Batboy's like median attributes

498
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,650
are like 13 out of 100.

499
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,650
His like strength and grappling

500
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,650
and dexterity and all that shit

501
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,650
is less than 20 for every single one.

502
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,650
He should have been eliminated a long

503
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,650
time ago, but he's still in it for some reason.

504
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,650
Hey, maybe not for long.

505
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,650
Pencil's got him on the corner. You're gonna possibly throw him

506
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,650
over. No!

507
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,650
He gets a hand in the mouth right into

508
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,650
what is, what is Abierre doing?

509
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,650
What the hell is that? He was just like making origami

510
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,650
in front of him. He wasn't even like touching him.

511
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,650
And here comes number 18.

512
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,650
Sorry.

513
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,650
You didn't think there was gonna be

514
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,650
any more serial characters

515
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,650
did you? You didn't think that Sonny

516
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,650
the Cocoa Puffs Bird was gonna make an

517
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,650
appearance at number 19 in the

518
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,650
Jerma Rumble. Here he is. Sonny.

519
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,650
He's Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs

520
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,650
and he's Cuckoo for the audience too. Look at him

521
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,650
riling him up, pointing and shouting. Everyone's

522
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,650
getting so fired up from Cuckoo the Cocoa Puffs

523
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,650
Sonny the Bird. And now he's in the ring

524
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,650
diving over with a beautiful display. They're going

525
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,650
right for Batboy. Strangely

526
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,650
enough, why did he go right for Batboy?

527
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,650
Batboy and Gabe Newell were in

528
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,650
sort of a little tussle there, but he

529
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,650
he may have been listening to me backstage.

530
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,650
There's a monitor back there. He just definitely

531
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,650
heard me talking about his low attributes

532
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,650
and he's gonna go, he's gonna take this to his advantage.

533
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,650
He's gonna push over Batboy. Is Sonny the Bird gonna do it?

534
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,650
Sonny the Bird's gonna toss him. He tosses

535
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,650
him. That's it. Batboy has been eliminated.

536
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,650
Sonny using

537
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,650
insider trading to be

538
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,650
able to throw Batboy over

539
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,650
the ropes there, which is sort of unfortunate

540
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,650
for Batboy because he went far. And now

541
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,650
Sonny is sort of just standing around not doing

542
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,650
anything. He went for the easy route

543
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,650
and now he's just chilling out while we have another

544
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,650
competitor coming in. This is the final

545
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,650
competitor, the final person in

546
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,039
JermaRumble 3 is

547
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,039
it's Tony the Tiger!

548
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:06,039
Do you hear this crowd right now?

549
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,039
This is the loudest I've ever heard

550
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,039
the Germania crowd screaming for

551
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,039
Tony the Tiger, the most physically

552
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,039
fit, the most positively influenceable,

553
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,039
the best serial character in

554
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,039
a lot of people's opinions. Here he comes

555
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,039
for the first time ever, Tony the Tiger

556
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,039
rounding out the number 20 spot.

557
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:24,039
Finally, the last person is

558
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,039
in and one of these

559
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,039
five is going to be crowned

560
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,039
JermaRumble 3 champion.

561
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,039
And there is a high chance

562
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,039
it's gonna be another serial

563
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,039
character. So place

564
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,039
your bets now. Somebody in

565
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,039
this ring is going to win.

566
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:42,039
Will it be the much deserved

567
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,039
Gabe Newell victory that we've all

568
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,039
been waiting for? Could it be a revival

569
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,039
of the Biaz? Could the Biaz

570
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,039
take it? Could Gabe Newell just clothesline

571
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,039
Sonny the Bird over the top ropes? Yes he will!

572
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:54,039
See you later, Sonny!

573
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,039
And now there are four.

574
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,039
You see, this is where fatigue,

575
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,039
this is where the nerves, this is where the

576
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,039
computer AI, which one isn't a moron,

577
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,039
this, all this stuff comes into play

578
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,039
at the very end of a JermaRumble.

579
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,039
You see we've got the Bia now and Gabe Newell in the

580
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,039
corner, two very heavy characters.

581
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:12,039
The Bia and Gabe Newell,

582
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,039
very large characters. Gabe Newell with ease

583
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,039
seems to pick up the Bia on the top

584
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,039
turnbuckle. Can he do it? He's very heavy!

585
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,039
Is he that strong?

586
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:22,039
He is! Gabe Newell just eliminated

587
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,039
Bia 846. That's another

588
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,039
elimination that you can tally

589
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:28,039
onto Gabe Newell. He has been

590
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,039
on a spree. It looks like him and Tony

591
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,039
the Tiger are going to- No! It's a reversal!

592
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,039
The pencil just reversed that double

593
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:36,039
DDT attempt. What a fantastic

594
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,039
double reversal that

595
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,039
was by the pencil. You just don't see

596
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,039
reversals like that anymore, let

597
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,039
alone from a character that's as shitty as

598
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,039
the pencil. Now Gabe Newell, Gabe Newell

599
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:48,039
on the defensive. Gabe Newell might be eliminated

600
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,039
right here by two of these assholes! No, he

601
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,039
ends up getting out of punches and both in the head

602
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,039
and for Tony the Tiger's trouble, he's going to

603
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,039
get thrown over. Could Gabe Newell get

604
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,039
another elimination here? Could it be possible?

605
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:00,039
Is Tony the Tiger going to fight back? Is the pencil

606
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:02,039
going to rescue him? No! Gabe Newell has

607
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,039
just eliminated Tony the Tiger as well!

608
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,039
Unbelievable!

609
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:08,039
Gabe Newell, that's like five

610
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,039
eliminations almost in a roll

611
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,039
for Gabe Newell and now we are down to

612
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,039
the final two. These are the final

613
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,039
competitors, the pencil

614
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,039
and Gabe Newell. One of

615
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,039
these two is going to be crowned

616
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,039
German Rumble 3 champion. Will it be

617
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,039
the shit character or will it be the most

618
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,039
beloved man in the history

619
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,039
of PC gaming? And he throws over

620
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,039
the pencil, body to back suplex,

621
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,039
and he might have possibly injured his face

622
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,039
on that somehow. What a

623
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,039
reversal. What a block and an elbow to Gabe Newell's face!

624
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,039
Almost blinding him, punching him in the eye,

625
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,039
only seeming to irritate Gabe

626
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,039
Newell just a little bit while he

627
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,039
gets him with a big boot right to his gut there.

628
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,039
Throws him over the ropes and they both bounce into

629
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,039
each other. I think Gabe Newell had a different

630
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,039
strategy there and he didn't utilize it.

631
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,039
Maybe going for a powerbomb, his patented finishing

632
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:54,039
move, the powerbomb, no! Going to

633
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,039
try and maybe end this right now.

634
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,039
No, he's just taunting, maybe catching his breath a little

635
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,039
bit after all that. He did eliminate a bunch of people

636
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,039
after all. And the pencil was probably

637
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,039
very low on his priorities

638
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,039
for who he should eliminate. And

639
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:08,039
dear God, he just threw him across the

640
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,039
entire ring. And the

641
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,039
pencil is hurt. The pencil is

642
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,039
really hurt right now. May have a broken

643
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,039
leg. Gabe Newell being a good guy, checking

644
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,039
on him, making sure. No!

645
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,039
No! What a cheap

646
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,039
shot that was. He cheap

647
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:24,039
shot him. He hit Gabe Newell right in his family

648
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,039
jewels. No, this can't be it.

649
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,039
It can't end like this. Gabe Newell

650
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:30,039
is holding up a dear life. Can the pencil eliminate

651
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,039
Gabe Newell after that cheap shot?

652
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,039
That's the end. The pencil

653
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,039
has won Jerma Rumble 3 on

654
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,039
a cheap, low

655
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,039
blow. Oh, you've

656
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,039
got to be kidding me. You've

657
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,039
got to be kidding me. Gabe Newell cannot believe

658
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,039
what just happened, and neither can

659
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,039
I, and neither can this crowd.

660
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,039
Do we really have to

661
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,039
crown this guy Jerma Rumble champion?

662
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,279
In the rule books, we do.

663
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,279
Ladies and gentlemen, your

664
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,279
Jerma Rumble 3 champion,

665
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,970
the pencil.

666
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:08,259
Jerma Rumble 3 is in the books,

667
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,259
and I'll see you at the next event.
