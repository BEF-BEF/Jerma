1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:21,109
Stop punching me. Don't punch me. Don't punch me. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good to see you again. Get him.

2
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,219
I got a little froggy in my throat. Trying to get rid of him.

3
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,979
I can't. It's still there. Why? You're a noisy streamer. Hold on. This is why I've been sitting

4
00:00:42,979 --> 00:01:10,709
here clearing my throat for like five- Okay, I'm back. That took long enough. Today, from the title

5
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:14,549
of the stream, you probably see we're gonna be playing Connect again. We're going back to it.

6
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:24,219
We're gonna start with one of the most popular fucking frog in my throat. We're gonna start

7
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:30,250
with one of the most popular frogs. The guy that goes, hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my

8
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,579
ragtime gal. I don't even know what his name is. He's probably the most popular frog, right?

9
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:45,510
Slippy Toad? Who's the most famous frog ever? Oh, Curret the Frog, right. Don't turn off by 360.

10
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,829
What are you talking about? If you're having trouble, don't turn off the 360. No, don't turn

11
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,310
off my 360. Okay, we're good. I thought my 360 just almost auto-powered down.

12
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,750
All right, hi. I'm just gonna- I don't- Here, look. I have to do this so I can get out of the

13
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:16,860
fucking way. We're starting. Hi. Oh, it's screaming at me. I got my wireless Bluetooth headphones.

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:31,099
Streamer alert? What's going on with the hair? And I don't- Okay.

15
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:40,939
I don't- My lighting in my room sucks. And this camera sucks. It's a horrible combo. I have one

16
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,229
recessed light right here that beams down an interrogation light. And then I have, like,

17
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,169
one of those Walmart Logitech webcams. All of them suck. Wait, hold on. Did you see my hands?

18
00:02:54,729 --> 00:03:01,259
Even the expensive Logitech webcams, they're all- They're fucking terrible.

19
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:08,580
What ha- What the fuck? And they have, like, oh, the Logitech C29, the C40, the C920,

20
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,289
the C, the C- What are all these fucking webcams that all are terrible? Why do they all look like

21
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:30,460
this? Anyways. Anyways. All right, I'm still in a fucking really weird mood. It didn't leave

22
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,259
from yesterday. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I think it's like the- the- the-

23
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:42,699
when the weather gets, like, a little better and nicer. Like, it's a reverse, like, full moon.

24
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,840
I- I like it more weird as the- as, like, the spring comes in. I'm like a fucking flower.

25
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,569
Anyways. We're gonna play Connectimals right now. We gotta test something first, though.

26
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:10,039
Where are you? There you are. You ready? I'm gonna put my finger up. Ready? One! One! One! That's not

27
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:22,220
right. It's a little delayed. I gotta go more delayed, right? Well, here's the problem. It's

28
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:32,980
delayed from me to the Connect. And then it's delayed from you to the stream. I see myself,

29
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,180
then it goes. See myself, then it goes. All right, I get it delayed a little more. Hold on.

30
00:04:36,819 --> 00:05:00,170
It's a double delay, Andy. I know. Why's my room red? 750 delayed. Try that. Here we go, right? Pretty

31
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:20,019
good. One. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep. A little more. 800. I need a little more. More power.

32
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:39,670
800. Get it to 800 power. Try that. Sweep. Why do people cast like this, like, when they cast spells?

33
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,850
Just go like that. You ever think about that? In every, like, RPG and every fucking fantasy

34
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,970
thing, why do they have to do weird casts? Just fucking point and say fireball. Why is it like

35
00:05:51,930 --> 00:06:04,730
fire? No, just go. That's so much easier. Fireball! Why go like this? That's fucking stupid.

36
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:17,860
What were we doing? All right. Sweep. Sweep. Go. Yes. I think we're good. You guys ready?

37
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:32,889
Because it's cool. Did you see my belly button just come up? All right. You ready? You ready?

38
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:41,879
Everybody? I'm just fucking connected up. This is Connectimals. This game's probably not good.

39
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:54,120
Here we go. I'm calibrated. Ah, welcome to the world of Connectimals. Did Peter Molyneux make

40
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,170
this game? Peter Molyneux made this game, right? Oh, no, he made another one with, like, a little

41
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:09,860
boy. What happened? What happened? This thing freaked out. What happened? What happened? What

42
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:34,490
just happened? What's going on? Wave to connect. Please face the sender. Sensor. I need a controller.

43
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:46,199
What the fuck are you doing? What? What did I press? Hold on. What did I press? Oh, it wants

44
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:53,850
sign in with your email. Fuck you. I don't even- I have no idea what that is. Holy shit, I have

45
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:03,079
absolutely no idea what this is. I have no idea what my password is. I'm just gonna be David

46
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:15,480
instead. Yeah, who cares? I have absolutely no idea. All right, David. We're gonna be logging

47
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:25,990
as David. He doesn't have Xbox live. It's like my little brother. Okay, let's go. We're David.

48
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:42,279
So this one's now with bears. Why does it have to be so far away? I'm just getting closer. I don't care.

49
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,879
Hello, and welcome to the island. To get started, put your arm out and hover over the start button.

50
00:08:50,759 --> 00:09:05,830
That's Invader Zim. That's Invader Zim. Uh, what's his name? I know it. Richard. Richard what?

51
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:22,889
What's his name? Oh, I don't care about signing in. Fuck off. Richard Horvitz. There he is. Wait,

52
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:36,039
I'm not David though. Oh shit, I just stole David's identity. Guest. Select bear adventure. Um,

53
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,779
I think I don't want to do regular connectibles. To start, put out your hand and swipe it in front

54
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,259
of you like this. I like the way this camera is, by the way. It's a bad camera position. We need to

55
00:09:45,259 --> 00:10:03,980
spring this. What the fuck did I just do? What did I do? Did I pick bear adventure?

56
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:22,409
Oh, there they are. Wolf den. I picked bear adventure. Should I do the first one first?

57
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:39,820
Why is my room red? You're a Satanist.

58
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
You're a curious looking pirate. Where's your house?

59
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Whoa, 3D. Don't you our eyes be an explorer, yes? Well, you've certainly discovered something here.

60
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,850
Welcome to the island. Get out of here, you little fucking weirdo. But please come. Everybody will

61
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,330
want to meet you. We haven't seen anyone since the captains left on their expedition.

62
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,409
I didn't want to do this one. It's a sacred place. We call it the bonding circle.

63
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:18,620
It's where- I wanted to do the regular game. Where is everybody? Being shy.

64
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,860
No need to be shy, little one. Should I go back? Come on. It's where cubs start their

65
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:33,750
bond with their human companions. Okay. Should I do the bear adventure? Does it matter? Which

66
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:45,990
one's better? What? The bonding circle. What? We'll play the default game. All right. I'll

67
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,350
play this for five minutes and then I'm going back. Oh, this is back when like loading screens

68
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,549
were a majority of like the 12 hours of the game. It was like four hours.

69
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:02,740
Which one? Which should I pick? Whatever you're not sure what to do,

70
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:13,429
just follow me and do what I do. Okay. I could panda bear. Hold out your hand like this. I don't

71
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,639
hope. No, I don't want the panda bear though. Hold out your hand and swipe it in front of you.

72
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,690
That's it. Now, if you swipe with your left hand, you can look at the cubs to your left.

73
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:34,980
Go ahead. Left and right to me. Why can't I just turn my body? All right. So we got- that's-

74
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,960
we got brown bear, black bear. All right. Hold on. Grizzly bear. Grizzly bear is very cute.

75
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:50,090
Black bear. Black bear is like little dogs. All you have to do is put your hand out in front of

76
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,649
you. Don't worry. Oh, no panda or polar bear. Don't these- don't- aren't these mean-

77
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:08,360
Fucking connect is- is stupid. Go ahead. Reach out with both your hands and give it a good pet.

78
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,539
I guess we have a fucking polar bear. Oh, he's such a good boy. Left and right to move parts of

79
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:30,299
its body. He's so cute. Step left and right. I don't want a pet there. What the fuck? Oh,

80
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:42,730
polar bear. This cub is one of my favorites. No. Good. We can go somewhere else. What's this one?

81
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:55,509
Honey bear? A poo bear? A cinnamon bear? Hold on. I need to see the cinnamon bear. Oh, this is the

82
00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:07,899
bear that's on all the cereal boxes. I like this one. How are you? Oh, he looks like a little fox.

83
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,539
I'm like down here. Down here. He just like shits in my hand. Oh, it's okay. It's all right.

84
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:34,580
Promise me you won't name it cinnamon. They really don't like that. Yes. That'd have been bear.

85
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:45,190
Karma, what the fuck? What? Oh, they just bit me. Oh, they are bears. Do you want to give your new

86
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:54,740
friend a name right now? Yes. Should we name him? I think it's time we gave your little one a name,

87
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:11,460
don't you? Say it out loud. Snuggles the first of his name. Snuggles the bear. Dryer sheet bear.

88
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:22,539
Dryer sheet. Do I have to press the button? Dryer sheet bear.

89
00:15:31,139 --> 00:16:05,590
Dryer sheet bear. Dryer sheet bear. Oh, he loves it. I have to say that every time. He loves it.

90
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:15,059
Picture or something to identify this. Scan a picture. No. Like on my fucking printer. Looks

91
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,379
like you're ready to go see where you'll be staying while on the island. I have to go scan an image

92
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:37,340
and like upload it? Scan your face. Oh. Now that you have a bear companion to show you everything

93
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,500
on the island. What do you even do in this game? Or rather the home of Captain Lawrence Biddler.

94
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:57,799
Lawrence. What are these houses? You don't do anything. You don't do anything. You just walk

95
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:09,640
around. This is a baby game. Oh. This was like a huge seller. It's like the number one bestseller

96
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:31,660
in New York Times Connect list. My house? Oh, your house. Okay.

97
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,710
Where's my house? Oh, he already got in.

98
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,910
Those are the original like connectables?

99
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:14,329
I have to drink my coffee. You're ugly.

100
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:20,170
I were at each other's throats. You know, it really is impossible to be annoyed to death.

101
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,170
That's when Captain Blackwood decided it would be better for me to live with his best friend

102
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:34,890
Biddler. I think things worked out rather well actually. Oh. What's his name? Dryer? Sheet Bear?

103
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,930
What the heck are you doing over here? You goofball.

104
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:50,150
Journal. It explains what happened to the captains. Three weeks since we landed on

105
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,910
Mira. At first, I couldn't believe me eyes. Good pirate voice. But half a day's sail from the

106
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,910
moor. Let's see if I can match it. It's curious that we've never seen it before.

107
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,829
And probably it's not one-to-one so I don't sound like I'm lying.

108
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:10,390
And when we found me old friend Lawrence Biddler and little Lena here all alone.

109
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:16,630
Well, you can imagine my surprise. Lawrence told me about the gift that brought him here

110
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,329
and the story about the kingdom. I thought we days of treasure hunting were done after my

111
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:30,650
search for Felisaurum. But I have to admit, I can't resist the urge for more adventure.

112
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,210
I'm just, I'm antsy. I want to connect. I sent the crew away on the bonnie barnacle

113
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,250
and told the moor that Biddler and I were going to stay as long as the bears.

114
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:47,930
As on Lemuria, the bears are just cubs. Well, I have some theories about that. Up on the cliff

115
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:51,049
is an abandoned fort. 35 year old man playing video games.

116
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,289
It was built long ago by some band of forgotten pirates.

117
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,450
Don't tell anyone. Only to realize that their ship are scattered across the beaches.

118
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,650
Just suppose them. But what if they never left the island

119
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,529
and found the entrance to the hidden kingdom? How?

120
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:10,890
Tomorrow, all Biddler and I will travel. By the way, these jeans are way too small for

121
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,529
me now. I'm like a fat guy. I gained like 25. The ship passed on the island for months already

122
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,190
when captain Blackwood arrived. This bear can read?

123
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,690
The captain set out to explore the island. Captain Biddler asked me to look over the

124
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,329
house and the bears. I'm not sure what happened to them, but they never came back.

125
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,609
Where's my bear food? I want to like drop the bear food.

126
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:38,839
Over there is a map of the island. This is Fort Topaz. It's not far at all.

127
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:42,440
Let's go see if we can find out what happened with the captains.

128
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,160
I don't want to do that. I want to feed the bear.

129
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,640
It looks like your bear cub is ready to go. These cubs love to play at Fort Topaz.

130
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:56,339
Let's get- Okay, is it kind of weird? I feel like this is like,

131
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,569
bears are not like dogs. They're not like, oh, yip yip, come get me, my friend.

132
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,170
Like this is weird, right? Like why is the bear acting like it's a puppy that I just

133
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:15,609
bought from like, like a little small puppy. They'll kill you, right? Yeah.

134
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,339
Well, a baby won't.

135
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:22,339
I think your cub smells the fresh sea air.

136
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:33,299
This is a kid's game? I know. An adult playing a kid's game.

137
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:38,150
Look, they're so cute. He's acting like a puppy.

138
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,039
This is like a, this is like a dachshund puppy.

139
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,940
All right, let's play. How do, what do I do?

140
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:04,440
Friar Sheet Bear. Friar Sheet Bear. They've gone bipedal. This is where they

141
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,839
fucking- I just know I've saw this movie. They take over humanity.

142
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:12,740
Friar Sheet Bear. Hey, go. Oh, what'd you get?

143
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,539
Is it a whistle?

144
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:24,579
Yes.

145
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,319
It's as easy as that. Spin in place. Careful you don't get too dizzy.

146
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,339
Oh, it knows. To make a great team.

147
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,690
Okay, here's a fun one. The play dead trick.

148
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,329
All you have to do is lie flat on your back. Go ahead. Don't be shy.

149
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:04,730
Or you could just play dead.

150
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:18,980
Can I do like the Backstreet Boys thing? All right, fine. He's getting angry.

151
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,980
All right, I'll be dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.

152
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,369
I'm dead down here. I'm dead down here.

153
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,259
Okay, what about this?

154
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:59,579
Leave me and my friend alone. Give me a hug. What do I do?

155
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:07,539
I'm gonna do that. Teach him look at me.

156
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:16,380
Lie down. Look, lie down. Lie down. Down. Lie down. Lie down.

157
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,259
Good. Good. Friar Sheet Bear. Good. Friar Sheet Bear.

158
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:34,390
Up, up, up, up, up. I don't wanna do that again.

159
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:49,079
We get money? What trick? Star Jump.

160
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,970
All right, let's do this like a two-year-old.

161
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:19,380
Come here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

162
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,019
Oh, a ball.

163
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,920
You're gonna learn from the master.

164
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:54,650
By the way, first one to fucking blink loses. How long can you go?

165
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:05,450
I feel like this is the kind of shit that was on Jimmy Fallon 10 years ago or something.

166
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,940
Oh, this guy plays juggle with his bear.

167
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,779
He's juggle with his bear.

168
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,609
Jimmy Fallon is not this good.

169
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,470
Yes.

170
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:54,970
Oh, I thought it was a key. Landmine.

171
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:02,170
What the fuck is wrong with you? What is wrong with you, dude?

172
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,690
It's a lot. I'm supposed to take a sip out of that.

173
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,890
Oh, juggle challenge.

174
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:16,869
Keep the ball in the air.

175
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:22,680
Okay. Pop as many bubbles as you can while juggling. I'm ready for this one.

176
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:43,609
Oh, you and me. Are these frogs? This is wicked fucked up.

177
00:27:44,329 --> 00:28:15,799
I told you the bears were evil. Didn't even miss one.

178
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:38,619
Didn't even miss one frog. This is terrible. I think this is bad. This is not a bad game.

179
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:46,019
Did I pick the wrong... Did I pick the expansion? Did I play the regular game?

180
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:54,069
You do this in the regular game?

181
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:22,779
He hates this game. I mean, I don't... Don't worry. We're just getting started.

182
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:24,859
We're just getting warmed up with connectables. HD.

183
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:28,549
I got the Fable Connect game back here.

184
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,549
Able Connect. That one's supposed to have magical fucking spells.

185
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:46,920
This is just an excuse to get parents to get their kids to move their fucking arms around.

186
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,039
They think they're playing with the bear cub that they're just doing the exercising.

187
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,069
Wonderful. Congratulations. You've earned your first medal.

188
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:07,529
That's a gold medal. You'll get a shiny trophy too.

189
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:12,700
Do you want to try again? To the fort.

190
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,619
Careful on these steps. They can be slippery.

191
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,980
Speedrun. Isn't that just a window into...

192
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,900
Skip, skip, skip, skip. I had a chance.

193
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,579
I had one opportunity to get the hell out of here.

194
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:42,500
Oh, by the way, we also have more movies to make.

195
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,269
Thinking about that. All right. Let's play.

196
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,829
Anytime you want to play with one of your toys, open your toy box.

197
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:58,710
All you have to do is hold your arm out to the bottom.

198
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,150
Let's go. You can also just say, open toy box or open inventory.

199
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,309
Next game now. Hold on. It has been 30 minutes.

200
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,539
How have I been in for 30 minutes? Open toy box.

201
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:25,660
Toys are available. Hold your hand over a box to see what toys are inside.

202
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,880
Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it on camera

203
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,319
so you can tell that I'm not fucking faking it?

204
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,839
If you see a toy you like, hold your hand...

205
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,470
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

206
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:53,019
Fuck yeah. Go get it.

207
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:59,190
Who has the ball? I'm doing... No, I'm not doing juggle.

208
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,309
I'm not doing juggle. This game suck.

209
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:10,779
Should I move on? No, it does.

210
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:13,819
I thought this was like one of the New York Times Best Seller Connect game.

211
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:19,140
Did I mess it up? Don't leave.

212
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,220
Don't leave dryer sheet beer.

213
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,329
Is this a normie game?

214
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,049
Like eight-year-old normies?

215
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:30,890
What are you talking about? Wait, what?

216
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:35,079
Oh, yes. It's a normie game.

217
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,000
All those like seven-year-olds.

218
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,160
The seven-year-old normies.

219
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,700
Seven-year-old doesn't barely have to tie shoes.

220
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,900
What do you mean? Bro, juggle with them.

221
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,650
Fine. All right. I'm going to put in...

222
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:53,849
I'm going to put in the fable game.

223
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,859
This is actually a cereal box game for kids.

224
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,059
And let me do the rubber chicken.

225
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,180
Let me do the rubber chicken. Hold on.

226
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,500
Did he fucking record that?

227
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:16,069
I don't know he could do that.

228
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:26,099
Juggling.

229
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:31,829
Xbox record that.

230
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,819
That must have been really loud. I'm so sorry.

231
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:36,980
Holy shit. That was probably horrible.

232
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,450
Hold out your arm to the bottom right.

233
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:52,789
Not loud enough.

234
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:54,230
All right. Hold on. I see a sandwich right here.

235
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,109
There's like some sandwich.

236
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,289
Let's at least like do the thing.

237
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,130
Let me at least like give him a bath, right?

238
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,289
That's like fun. That'll be like fun.

239
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,559
Here we go. Let's give him a bath.

240
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,110
Cleaning is an important way of caring for your animal.

241
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,989
Able. Wait.

242
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,110
If your animal gets dirty,

243
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,349
just give it a good scrub with the cleaning brush.

244
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,050
Washing his eyes.

245
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,570
All over your cub's body.

246
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:27,110
Where's the water?

247
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,889
I think I'm about to be using any water.

248
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,570
Wouldn't that just be dry and like scratchy?

249
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:44,179
All right. Let me see what the other items are.

250
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:44,820
I'm not done yet.

251
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,460
Dryer sheet, bear.

252
00:34:56,059 --> 00:35:01,719
Oh.

253
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,260
To change the direction of your throw.

254
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:16,650
To the face.

255
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,980
He's like bounced off his nose.

256
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:23,699
I'm trying to hit her.

257
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:25,769
That's bad too.

258
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,300
Longest throw.

259
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,059
Oh yeah. I'll show you a long throw.

260
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:30,860
Let's see that.

261
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,360
Good boy.

262
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,139
I'm going to the ocean.

263
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Hey, hey. Look, look, look, look.

264
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,840
Look, look, look, look.

265
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,480
Look what I got.

266
00:35:47,480 --> 00:36:01,099
Look what I got.

267
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:01,599
Eat it.

268
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,380
Shit. This is so not synced up correctly.

269
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,579
I'm doing it and then it's happening.

270
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,059
Next game. Next.

271
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,019
Wait. One more item.

272
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,690
No dryer sheet, bear.

273
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,440
Okay.

274
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:54,980
No dryer sheet, bear.

275
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,619
Throw dryer.

276
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:56,739
Show dryer sheet.

277
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:25,860
What the what the fuck does he have on his head?

278
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,989
Sometimes your cub friend wants to play with.

279
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,340
Choose whether or not to.

280
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,179
By holding your arm out to the right for yes or to the left for no.

281
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,739
All right. I want to climb a tree first.

282
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,820
Look, I got a lot of cadet games to go through.

283
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:53,780
How do I do that?

284
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,190
If bears love anything, it's climbing.

285
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,699
Guys, no exception.

286
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,940
To get your bear to climb up the tree.

287
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,739
Move your hands above your head like this.

288
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:13,179
Step left and right to get a better view of your surroundings.

289
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,579
Wait. Am I on like a drone?

290
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:41,699
Your bear to climb back down the tree.

291
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,460
Just crouch down like this.

292
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,760
He's going to fall.

293
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,599
Your bear will slide down the trunk.

294
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,800
This is so stressful.

295
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,760
Slide down. Slide down.

296
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
If there are any little...

297
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,320
Come down from there.

298
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,800
Your bear is sure to gobble them up.

299
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,760
Oh, it's four bear.

300
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,599
It's bear.

301
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,280
Run to hold the part.

302
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,900
Oh my god.

303
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,880
Fucking fable.

304
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:36,070
Hold on.

305
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,820
Probably a lot.

306
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,590
Or a dryer sheet bear.

307
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:02,570
Fuck it, fable.

308
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:11,099
I thought this would make sure your room has enough space to play.

309
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:11,739
Don't look up.

310
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,300
An anvil going to drop on my head?

311
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:22,579
Webcam's too big.

312
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,190
Turn the lights off.

313
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,110
No, you won't be able to see me.

314
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,019
This is the Peter Molyneux one.

315
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:46,739
Wasn't there a Peter Molyneux game where he's like...

316
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:49,780
Take a seat, get comfortable, and get ready for your journey.

317
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:53,059
Try to sit upright and keep your legs uncrossed.

318
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:03,820
For best results, place your Kinect sensor in a central position, above or below your TV.

319
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:14,789
You may need to sit forward in your seat if it has

320
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:24,070
high arms, a low seat, or a soft back.

321
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,800
Make sure you have enough room to play.

322
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:40,739
Try not to sit too close to other people or objects.

323
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,110
You fired on me?

324
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,429
To access the Kinect guide while playing,

325
00:41:47,429 --> 00:41:49,590
hold your left arm straight out to your side.

326
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,710
Try this now to begin your journey.

327
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:54,679
Left arm?

328
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:20,500
Where does it want me to go?

329
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:24,170
I just did that.

330
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:29,980
Oh!

331
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,960
Hold on a second.

332
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:35,929
Why is...

333
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,289
Resume and begin.

334
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,269
Resume, begin.

335
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:39,670
Why...

336
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,550
What do you mean resume?

337
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,750
What the fuck are you talking about?

338
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:41,989
Why is...

339
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,389
What do you have a resume and begin button?

340
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,789
This thing is bright green.

341
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:47,670
It says resume.

342
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,300
Oh my god!

343
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,960
Running Kinect ID.

344
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,000
Please space the sensor.

345
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,420
Oh, David.

346
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,300
You could literally like torture me and I wouldn't know the password.

347
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:32,940
Okay, start games.

348
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,500
Can you see me?

349
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:35,050
I'm in view.

350
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,090
I want to get this right though,

351
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,010
because this is an actual fucking video game.

352
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:50,730
I guess it's not that bad.

353
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,449
It's pretty close.

354
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:54,659
Face cam, face cam.

355
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:56,579
Hold on, let me write the face cam up.

356
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:57,780
It looks fucking dark as hell.

357
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:05,590
Don't touch anything.

358
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,150
I can't even...

359
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:12,460
I have like a fucking whole goddamn unit of like technical directors

360
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,340
to like play a console game on your PC.

361
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,699
You got to have like 10 monitors.

362
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:24,179
To stream a console game,

363
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:26,659
you need to have like fucking 40 monitors.

364
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:39,030
It's so dark.

365
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,230
It's not this dark in my room.

366
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,130
It actually is not this dark in the room.

367
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:54,340
You need backlights?

368
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,260
Move the lights.

369
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,579
I don't have...

370
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:57,380
What do you mean move the lights?

371
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,619
I have a recessed light in my sensor.

372
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:05,860
Turn on the sun.

373
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,489
This shit is so...

374
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,210
Why do all these like dinky little shit webcams

375
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,650
need like 5,000 megawatts of light

376
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,489
to like be shown up on screen?

377
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:27,300
You see me?

378
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,699
It's like we can literally send a fucking...

379
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,019
A rover to Mars.

380
00:45:35,019 --> 00:45:40,150
But I have to put a 5 million megawatt lamp in my face

381
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,070
to show up on this without blowing,

382
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,349
blowing the fuck out the exposure.

383
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,849
Why?

384
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,880
No, it ain't the window.

385
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,320
I've had this problem for years.

386
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,659
It's your fat ass.

387
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:02,340
My ass is just like fucking huge,

388
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,699
like blocking out the sun.

389
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,010
Get a better camera.

390
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:08,119
No, they're all like this.

391
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,480
All webcams are like this.

392
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,980
That's why there's a whole company, guys,

393
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,409
that makes like streamer lights.

394
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:17,210
Because they know it's like a Band-Aid problem.

395
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,090
You know what I mean?

396
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:27,099
I ain't getting fucking streamer lights.

397
00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:28,139
Uh, hold on.

398
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:32,019
That's red.

399
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:32,579
Red.

400
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:39,880
High balance is fucking horrible.

401
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:45,420
What the hell is going on here?

402
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:54,230
Let's go!

403
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,139
Where did you go?

404
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:01,340
Hold on.

405
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:12,019
All right, I gotta sit back down.

406
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:16,789
Perfect.

407
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:17,670
What's over there?

408
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,269
Oh, there's like a fucking toy over there.

409
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:23,460
All right, that should be good.

410
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:25,269
Where did you go?

411
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:26,150
The Kinect sensor having trouble.

412
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,949
Okay.

413
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:27,590
Whoa, look at me.

414
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,869
I'm like lit up over there.

415
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:29,750
Oh yeah, I remember this.

416
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:31,269
Shit, you can't do it.

417
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:33,219
All right, I'm ready.

418
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:45,750
All right, start game.

419
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:51,000
You guys ready for fable?

420
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,670
Your mic's in the middle.

421
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,250
I got you.

422
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:00,650
There you go.

423
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:06,570
Even the greatest of journeys must begin with a single step.

424
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:14,760
I completely forgot about old console games.

425
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,440
We're obsessed with having alone out bloom

426
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,800
on every single title that made the game run at 18 frames a second

427
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,320
to hide the fact that the game was ugly.

428
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,000
You guys remember that shit?

429
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,920
Wow, I'm so glad we're over that.

430
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:39,179
Come on, keep the pace up.

431
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:41,179
We've got a long way to go before we get home.

432
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,320
To me?

433
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,119
Good morning, Kaplan.

434
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:49,559
Thunder, with us holding up.

435
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,760
Should make good time today.

436
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,420
Daniel, I've seen Gabriel this morning.

437
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,300
Oh, not again.

438
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:58,739
Dammit, Gabriel.

439
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:00,099
Audio's desynced.

440
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:00,579
Where are you?

441
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:01,300
It is.

442
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,260
But I think that's the game.

443
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,739
I don't think that's anything to do with capturing.

444
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:09,219
I believe that's just the video game.

445
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:16,329
I can't wait to wash another animal with a brush.

446
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:19,670
Like in 60% of every Kinect game.

447
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:39,769
What do you think, Seren?

448
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:40,010
Come on.

449
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:40,969
DMT's kicking it.

450
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:42,090
I'm getting better.

451
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,280
I'm ready for whatever we run into.

452
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,079
Fucking ghosts.

453
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,159
Bumpy roads, bit of drizzle, stuff for legends.

454
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:52,630
Come on, girl.

455
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,050
Eat the horse.

456
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:11,320
Oh, come here.

457
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,840
The convoy will be moving on soon.

458
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,880
We better get you ready.

459
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,190
There's a fucking brushing game.

460
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:22,980
Good girl, Seren.

461
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,619
There's a good girl.

462
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,019
I got double brush.

463
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:30,920
We're gonna get this part of the skin raw.

464
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,119
There you are, Gabriel.

465
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:34,039
Kaplan, I thought you were getting the convoy ready.

466
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,880
Don't even move back.

467
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,760
Leave me alone.

468
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,039
You mean the triumph already left?

469
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:38,840
What were you doing?

470
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,800
I gotta move the mic over here.

471
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,639
Were you distracted by the butterflies?

472
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:44,039
Or were you just daydreaming about old fables?

473
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:45,880
No, I was just about to get Seren ready.

474
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Look, I'm not letting you out my sight.

475
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,079
Does your horse need a brushing?

476
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:51,239
Don't show me that.

477
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:52,599
I don't want that to look weird.

478
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,400
Now get Seren harnessed up and let's get moving.

479
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,760
All right, I just need to get me-

480
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,639
Now, Gabriel.

481
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:06,179
Why even have that part?

482
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:09,539
You so badly wanted to have the horse brushing segment.

483
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:10,260
Come on, Gabriel.

484
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,139
We could have opened here.

485
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,260
The convoy will be miles away by now.

486
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,139
Why have the horse-

487
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,659
You needed the horse brushing segment.

488
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:15,539
We could have opened here.

489
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:17,989
Keep your moustache on.

490
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:21,110
Open right here.

491
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,510
I can't wait to have to hold the reins.

492
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,309
Come on.

493
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:27,940
Catching up to do.

494
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,909
The tribe will be well-

495
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:32,389
What do I do?

496
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,829
Track the reins once to make Seren trot.

497
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:38,389
Once trotting, you can accelerate to a gallop

498
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,150
by cracking the reins a second time.

499
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,579
Okay, I'm ready.

500
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,480
Continue.

501
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:51,829
Here we go.

502
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,739
What were you doing back there, anyway?

503
00:51:58,059 --> 00:51:58,780
Nothing.

504
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,860
Yeah, and you'd have done that all day

505
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,059
if I hadn't come back.

506
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:02,860
Guys, I forgot to tell you.

507
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,699
I got the special connect seat.

508
00:52:04,699 --> 00:52:06,699
It's connected through the USB-C

509
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:07,659
in the back of the Xbox.

510
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,519
To steer right,

511
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:14,360
pull the right rein towards your body

512
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,800
and push the left rein away.

513
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,480
To steer left,

514
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,079
pull the left rein towards your body

515
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,000
and push the right rein away.

516
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,039
While steering,

517
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,320
try to keep your hands low

518
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,320
and make large, clear movements.

519
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,239
All right, we're going off a fucking cliff, I think.

520
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,489
Hey, open your eyes.

521
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,530
Hey, it's called steering.

522
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,090
Try it.

523
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:52,579
Oh, what are we doing?

524
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:53,219
What are we up to?

525
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:57,539
What are we doing?

526
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:00,420
Uh, reconnect seat.

527
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,219
That's right, I forgot.

528
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,820
It has like a little launch pad.

529
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:06,300
You know what they used to fucking make?

530
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:06,860
Shit like that.

531
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,059
They wanted it to be like that.

532
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:09,500
When are you going to fix up

533
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,099
this whole cart, Gabriel?

534
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:11,980
Soon.

535
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,179
There was like a vest.

536
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:15,340
There was like a whole huge vest you could put on

537
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,619
that when you get like shot in a game,

538
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,059
it like vibrated your heart.

539
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,940
They so badly wanted you to get like

540
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,820
actually hurt and shit.

541
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:32,869
Hey, look at him.

542
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:42,360
I'm not doing that.

543
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,780
Let me guess.

544
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,380
You were up all night

545
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,980
reading those old books of yours again,

546
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,699
weren't you?

547
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,059
Well, not all night.

548
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:52,260
Into the wall, into the wall.

549
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,460
No, you only do the

550
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,820
drive into the wall joke twice

551
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,619
before it's too much.

552
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,500
All this dreaming about magic,

553
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,940
heroes, stories we read

554
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,699
when we were knee high to a hob.

555
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:02,739
It's got to stop.

556
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,139
We're not children anymore.

557
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:06,900
Do I get to pick like my class?

558
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,739
And start doing, Gabriel.

559
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:12,659
Old fairy tales didn't get me where I am today.

560
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:13,300
Head of the combo.

561
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,260
Do I have like powers?

562
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,380
Do I have a weapon?

563
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:17,300
I had to make sacrifices.

564
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,980
This is an insanely long

565
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,500
ride the horse opening segment.

566
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,699
We don't need this here.

567
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:28,230
You showed me how the ride on the reins, right?

568
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,150
Let's keep it slow through here.

569
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,030
Nice and easy.

570
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,980
This segment is far too long.

571
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,820
Gently pull the reins to your chest

572
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,940
to lower your speed.

573
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,440
Rough terrain will injure Saren

574
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,960
and less ridden over at a trot.

575
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,840
Oh, that's why I was getting all fucked up.

576
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,000
So make sure you take good care of her.

577
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,010
Easy now.

578
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:53,210
Slow it down, Gabriel.

579
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:55,159
There you go.

580
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,719
Why can't you drive like this all the time?

581
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,809
That's the way.

582
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,489
Sarah may be old,

583
00:55:02,489 --> 00:55:04,650
but there's still a few miles left in the old girl.

584
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,369
All right, we're good.

585
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,889
Don't listen to him, girl.

586
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,889
He just wishes he had a horse like you.

587
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:09,849
Yeah, right.

588
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:10,489
That'll be it.

589
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:15,079
I think that was rough terrain,

590
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,119
but it doesn't matter.

591
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,039
I don't think this matters.

592
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:22,900
Except for the,

593
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,739
except for whoever's in the back.

594
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,780
Whoever's inside of the cart is like,

595
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,219
oh my fucking God,

596
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,059
I can't even drink my tea.

597
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:32,500
You and Saren are going for a swim.

598
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,780
Show me how fast you can stop this thing.

599
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,420
Just so I know,

600
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,179
I don't have to worry about you when we get there.

601
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:43,050
If you need to come to a full stop quickly,

602
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,969
pull the reins back high over your head.

603
00:55:44,969 --> 00:55:45,690
Over your head?

604
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:56,809
Oh, all right.

605
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:58,010
I feel better now.

606
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,210
Now let's get moving.

607
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,010
Catch up to the comms.

608
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:01,210
I'm going to open up the back.

609
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,889
I'm going to go to the back of this thing and like,

610
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:03,929
open it up.

611
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:05,610
All the luggage is going to be everywhere.

612
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,489
All the luggage is going to be everywhere.

613
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,809
It's going to be like an overturned table.

614
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:12,329
Okay, hold on.

615
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,119
Did we get over?

616
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:28,949
Where are we going?

617
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:36,980
What happened?

618
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:50,039
This segment is way too fucking long.

619
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,099
Oh, I have four health left.

620
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:57,400
Get me to the town.

621
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,809
As you travel, you'll come across

622
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,429
experienced orbs on the road.

623
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,909
Collecting these will allow you to purchase upgrades.

624
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,949
Green orbs can be collected at any speed,

625
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:13,269
but other colors require specific speeds.

626
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:16,389
You know when you put like a video file into like a final cut

627
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:18,630
or a premiere timeline and you right click it

628
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,429
and you just say like 50% playback speed?

629
00:57:22,389 --> 00:57:26,070
I swear to God, I feel like that a lot of devs do like the,

630
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,869
put the game in and right click the fucking file

631
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:31,110
and do 50% fucking playback speed.

632
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:36,150
Just stretch the thing extra like another hour, two hours.

633
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,789
There's no reason.

634
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,710
Are people afraid that if they have like a four-hour experience,

635
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:49,909
not like a seven-hour experience,

636
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:52,469
that like it's going to be bad or something?

637
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,070
Like I'd rather have a three-hour experience

638
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:57,190
without me like fucking just stretched out timeline

639
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,429
and a seven-hour fucking filled with a bunch of junk.

640
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:02,150
Where did the time go?

641
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:05,349
Seems like only yesterday we were running through the fields

642
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:08,789
to play fighting sticks, not caring the world.

643
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:09,289
Hold on.

644
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,750
Sometimes I miss those days.

645
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,909
I swear to God, people, a lot of devs and maybe it's both.

646
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,949
Maybe it's like developers, reviewers, consumers, I don't know.

647
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,070
Like the prospect of having like a good five-hour game

648
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,869
versus like a bloated 12-hour game is I don't understand.

649
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,349
I'd rather have just to just cut all the bullshit out

650
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:28,389
and give me a fucking good game.

651
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,699
That's got to be, it's got to be eight to 12 hours.

652
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:33,760
Why?

653
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,369
Just make it good.

654
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,820
It's got to be 20.

655
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,320
I'm sorry.

656
00:58:39,179 --> 00:58:40,380
It's got to be a 28.

657
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,980
It's going to be a 30-hour experience.

658
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:44,039
Just make it 15.

659
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:45,400
Doesn't matter.

660
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,119
Make it a good game.

661
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,219
Only 12.

662
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:55,900
There on the horizon, bower stone or bricks and smoke.

663
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,539
Why would anyone live in a place like that

664
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,219
when they could have the open road, eh?

665
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:02,539
Five hours with replayability.

666
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,039
There you go.

667
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:07,239
Okay, I don't want to do this segment anymore.

668
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,679
We've been riding on the horse for like how, honestly, how long?

669
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,079
How long have we done tutorial horse for?

670
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,489
It's been like 14 or 15 straight minutes.

671
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:30,170
I've just ride on the horse tutorial.

672
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,849
I read it nearly ended the world once.

673
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:38,909
Holy shit.

674
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,670
And just he's gonna take it from me anyways.

675
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:43,400
Wherever that storm's coming from, it's heading this way.

676
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:47,070
The whole game is a tutorial.

677
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,780
I need to ride ahead now.

678
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,539
We'll be at Reba's reach soon.

679
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:54,699
Have to make sure the tribes together when we cross.

680
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,400
Just make sure you keep up the pace.

681
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:58,900
All right.

682
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,639
Saren can go even faster.

683
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:06,840
While galloping, crack the reins once to make Saren sprint.

684
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,199
Each time you crack the reins to make Saren sprint,

685
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:11,159
you'll use up some of her stamina.

686
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:11,719
All right, let's go.

687
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:18,590
If the stamina bar in the bowden center empties,

688
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,989
continuing to crack the reins will injure Saren.

689
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,230
All right, watch the stamina bar.

690
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,829
The bar will recharge.

691
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,199
Horse riding sim.

692
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,719
This is not even a horse riding sim though.

693
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:30,960
This is watching a horse riding sim movie.

694
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,719
See how fast we can catch up with the trine.

695
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:33,869
You ready, girl?

696
01:00:34,909 --> 01:00:41,400
All right, let's go.

697
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,039
Cross the bridge.

698
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:45,630
I can't wait to get to Shalefields.

699
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,630
Just think this time tomorrow we'll be across the river iron washing in the storm.

700
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:50,590
All right, how do I pull back?

701
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,230
Pull back the reins.

702
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,829
Looking up the clouds.

703
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:53,789
I care in the world.

704
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:02,820
Okay.

705
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,000
I was joking about my own saliva.

706
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:16,730
I can't go off the edge.

707
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:17,230
I tried.

708
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:22,519
Oh my god, a TV show.

709
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:38,079
All right, we got to see what this like Red Dead Redemption 2 stranger is.

710
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:46,409
Let's see.

711
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:49,530
What are we doing here?

712
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,320
Oh, I like choked on my spit and it like gave me a headache.

713
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:55,619
All right, stop.

714
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,460
Who are you?

715
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,460
I swear to god if he comes up with two brushes, I'm gonna be so pissed.

716
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:27,719
This is the whole game.

717
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:33,800
What you seek is for me to wallpaper your dining room a week next Thursday.

718
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,059
Uh, I don't think so.

719
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,340
Chicken chicer.

720
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,900
Oh, look, he's a little chicken chicer.

721
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:41,820
Chicken chicer.

722
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,880
I don't have any silver.

723
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,619
No, no, stay, stay, stay, stay.

724
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,840
Oh, shit.

725
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:13,260
God fucking damn it.

726
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:27,630
I wanted to do that.

727
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:41,820
What if we didn't have the stretched out timeline?

728
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,699
Oh, and yes, that's me, the magician.

729
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:45,659
Excuse me.

730
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:49,420
I will be painting your walls and your ceilings if you want.

731
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,139
Just fucking tell me what do we want me to do.

732
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:55,070
I'm here.

733
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,130
We can be pretty fast when we have to be, eh, girl?

734
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,139
What's the world coming to?

735
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,940
Mad cuz bad.

736
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,380
So glad you could join us.

737
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,030
I'm needed at the front of the convoy.

738
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,469
Oh, thank god, thank god you could join us for the slow part of the tutorial.

739
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:22,269
Can I go with you?

740
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:23,550
Oh, you can't even speed up.

741
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:27,130
Stay here at the back, Injured.

742
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,329
What shall I do with the other eye?

743
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:29,769
Very funny.

744
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:33,289
Just do your job and keep up with the convoy.

745
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:34,329
I'm counting on you.

746
01:04:34,969 --> 01:04:37,929
And make sure you don't fall asleep again, all right?

747
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:39,949
I'm not pulling you out of any more ditches.

748
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:41,630
Yeah.

749
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,429
Yeah.

750
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:50,840
Did you hear that, Seren?

751
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,280
Did you hear what he said to me?

752
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,239
Did you hear that?

753
01:04:53,239 --> 01:04:54,360
Did you hear that?

754
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,119
After all the trouble I got into last time.

755
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:10,880
What even happened?

756
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,440
How long has it been?

757
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,960
He fucking fell asleep.

758
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:18,760
What?

759
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,960
He actually fell asleep.

760
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,929
Why did he fall asleep?

761
01:05:34,989 --> 01:05:35,710
Red orbs.

762
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:36,590
Run, girl, run.

763
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:42,590
What are you doing?

764
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:47,800
Oh, catch up with everybody.

765
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,280
He fell asleep holding the brain.

766
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,960
Get to the convoy before it reaches the bridge.

767
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,639
Catlin might not realize we were gone.

768
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:55,480
I saw the death symbol and I was like,

769
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,679
I got to get some action in here.

770
01:05:56,679 --> 01:05:59,550
Because I'm going to trust me again.

771
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:15,630
Damn it, Gabriel.

772
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:16,269
Where are you?

773
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:18,539
God damn it.

774
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:19,500
I'm trying to go off the edge.

775
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,820
I'm trying to get some fucking comedy on my screen.

776
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,739
All I had to do was stay awake.

777
01:06:23,739 --> 01:06:24,940
Why didn't I stay awake?

778
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:35,579
Wait, I got to inject an absolute comedy home run right now.

779
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:36,619
Oh, malware bytes.

780
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:37,500
What are you talking about?

781
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:37,739
What?

782
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,380
Why is malware bytes popping up?

783
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,500
How long was he asleep?

784
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:43,659
This storm was miles away.

785
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,309
Oh, shit.

786
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:52,269
What happened down there?

787
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:58,909
I thought that was us for a second.

788
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:12,360
Just go flying.

789
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,559
What was that?

790
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,320
Why did he run out?

791
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,239
And what was that one's hand?

792
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:35,070
I can't hear you.

793
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:38,010
I didn't pick up the thing you said.

794
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,960
Sorry, but I'm going to assume you said to go to

795
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,119
Myanmar.

796
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:45,800
That's where I'm going.

797
01:08:04,489 --> 01:08:05,369
Myanmar?

798
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:06,250
What did he say?

799
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,050
Myer Moore.

800
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:11,849
What did he say?

801
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,229
Like the Myer?

802
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,600
Manor Moore?

803
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:24,649
I hope he falls asleep again.

804
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,449
Oh, Microsoft Studios presents

805
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,739
a Lionhead Studios production.

806
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,520
What a seamless, seamless transition to the game.

807
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,720
Fable.

808
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,079
The Journey.

809
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:51,229
Starring you.

810
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:55,130
It's a fucking hog moment.

811
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:55,449
I'm ready.

812
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,779
Wake up asleep again, please.

813
01:09:02,779 --> 01:09:04,380
And then maybe I have to go like this.

814
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:04,939
For an hour.

815
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:16,409
On that map.

816
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,039
Let's just try to get through Fairwood first.

817
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,119
Then we'll take it from there.

818
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:26,520
Oh, the GPS really took you a fucking shitty way.

819
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:29,319
Could have gone like straight.

820
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:32,199
There's like five roads that go that way.

821
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,729
Okay, here we go.

822
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:39,659
I can't believe that just happened.

823
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:41,979
I can't believe we're stuck out here alone.

824
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:43,579
Miles away from anywhere.

825
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,560
I just stayed awake.

826
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,720
We'd be across that bridge and on our way home by now.

827
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,920
Not stuck out here.

828
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:52,600
The map says there's a village up ahead.

829
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,159
There's a village.

830
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,680
Someone there will be able to help us.

831
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,359
Reach the village.

832
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,260
Triumph.

833
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:00,140
Go slower.

834
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,000
Give me those bits.

835
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:23,000
All right, we made it to Fairwood.

836
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,439
You have to be careful, Seren.

837
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:25,880
Need to be careful.

838
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,680
You've just earned your first upgrade token.

839
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:31,560
You can access your upgrades from the pause menu.

840
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,840
To pause the game now,

841
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,840
hold your left arm straight out to the side.

842
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,800
Are you fucking kidding me?

843
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,600
Upgrade me?

844
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:43,640
What the fuck?

845
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,199
Are you kidding me?

846
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:45,159
This is fucking awesome.

847
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,500
Calm down.

848
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:53,819
Whoa.

849
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:55,579
Upgrades.

850
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:05,710
Worst upgrade.

851
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:19,819
Redeem Fable Heroes Gold?

852
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:25,340
Oh yeah.

853
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,699
Didn't they do a thing where they made...

854
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,279
They did a thing.

855
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:31,720
They did do a thing, right?

856
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,439
Where there was this like slot machine game that they came up with?

857
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:39,000
Was it like a card game?

858
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,840
You made money and you could use it in Fable 2 or something?

859
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,560
I'm gonna hit that.

860
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:58,920
All right, pull it back.

861
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,189
When will we push the cart to one side?

862
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:07,880
God damn.

863
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,439
Like the Kinect is like the 3D glasses of the last generation.

864
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:13,079
It really was.

865
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:18,039
It was the stereographic 3D glasses of the last generation before this one.

866
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:30,539
I guess Shrub by fucking lightning?

867
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:41,520
Next game.

868
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:41,760
Not...

869
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,640
Hold on a second here.

870
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,439
Wait till I get a weapon.

871
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:50,279
Let me get a weapon first.

872
01:12:55,289 --> 01:13:00,859
Sword.

873
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:09,369
Why does he not have a weapon?

874
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:21,869
Do we have choices to make like in Fable?

875
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,890
Like let the lady get eaten by the monster or like fix the ship?

876
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:40,829
Who's got...

877
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:41,149
Who?

878
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,399
Don't worry, I got this.

879
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:16,090
You new around here?

880
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:18,960
Yeah, me too.

881
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,680
I just rolled in.

882
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,319
You're not waving your arms enough.

883
01:14:27,319 --> 01:14:28,680
You're not waving your arms enough.

884
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,239
More arm waving.

885
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,539
The only way we'll be able to escape.

886
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:00,590
He's shooting us.

887
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,869
Watch out, spikes.

888
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:09,550
This is a Disney ride.

889
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,590
Get away from this evil.

890
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:11,869
Do not let him touch the horse.

891
01:15:11,869 --> 01:15:13,069
No, this is a Disney ride.

892
01:15:13,069 --> 01:15:14,829
This is a Disney ride that you get off and you go.

893
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:15,869
That was not very good.

894
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:19,340
It's one of those boxes you go in

895
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,659
and you like go like this for like four straight minutes.

896
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:25,399
Oh, there he comes.

897
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:26,039
Look at those.

898
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,560
He's just screen.

899
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,609
And as you get off the ride and you kind of look around,

900
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:41,479
you're like, ah, that was like...

901
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:43,079
It took us like 40 minutes to get on that.

902
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:48,199
Can I just eat like the Mickey Mouse bar?

903
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:57,760
Okay, if like a YouTube video of the ride

904
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,119
is as good as the ride,

905
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:00,560
I don't know if it's worth waiting an hour for.

906
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,399
On rails.

907
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:18,439
This is not even on rails.

908
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:20,520
I'm not even really doing anything.

909
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:27,930
It is on, but like, completely on rails.

910
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,810
That's what on rails means.

911
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:36,220
Oh my god.

912
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:36,619
Whoa.

913
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:38,619
And right there you look over and your mom is like,

914
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:39,659
Keep going, girl.

915
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:40,380
You have to keep going.

916
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,300
It's like, oh, mom's having a good fucking time.

917
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,060
I'm having fun because mom's having fun.

918
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,960
Go look back, Seren.

919
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,319
Oh, flash.

920
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,239
Oh, they just took the picture.

921
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,310
And then every time I tell me if I'm crazy,

922
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,430
every single time I look at one of those photos of me,

923
01:17:02,989 --> 01:17:04,189
tell me if you guys do this too.

924
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,109
I try so hard to not look weird.

925
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,989
I know exactly when the fucking flash is going to happen,

926
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:10,430
but I desperately don't want to look weird.

927
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:12,350
So I sit there and I'm like,

928
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,829
I'm like, don't want to look like I'm having too much fun

929
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:16,189
because it'd be like weird.

930
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:17,310
But every time I go in and look,

931
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,789
I always look like my face is made out of clay.

932
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:20,989
We have to find somewhere to stop.

933
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:21,550
Every time.

934
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,149
Just need to hold on a little bit longer, girl.

935
01:17:23,149 --> 01:17:24,430
It doesn't matter if I'm like smiling

936
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:27,470
or if I'm like going like this or something.

937
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,909
My face always looks like this.

938
01:17:28,909 --> 01:17:30,109
You have to hold on, girl.

939
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,829
I just look like shit every time.

940
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:40,430
I've tried to look good in those photos.

941
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,550
Like, I know it's coming there.

942
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:42,510
We're going over the bend.

943
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,350
I know this is where they take the flash.

944
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,560
I go like that.

945
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,810
I don't want to look weird, but it doesn't matter.

946
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:49,850
Even if I sit there and go like this,

947
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:50,729
I know the flash is coming.

948
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:53,210
Oh, let's go find it.

949
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:53,930
Okay, flash.

950
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,810
Let's go find it at the end.

951
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:55,449
Okay, where is it?

952
01:17:58,170 --> 01:17:59,130
What the fuck, dude?

953
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,289
I tried to not look like a fucking weirdo.

954
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:15,979
Find a safe place to stop.

955
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,220
I'm giving this one some more time.

956
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:21,180
Whoa, girl.

957
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,010
I have to get those splinters out of you.

958
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:24,729
Oh, God.

959
01:18:24,729 --> 01:18:25,449
Okay, here we go.

960
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,720
Whatever that was, it's gone now.

961
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,920
I know I'm scared.

962
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,800
The horse is now evil.

963
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:42,590
This is a loading screen to pull the arrow out.

964
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:46,029
Seren has been seriously injured.

965
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:48,590
Grab the splinter with your right hand

966
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,949
and slowly pull it out.

967
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:52,270
Be careful while pulling the splinter

968
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,550
or you may hurt Seren.

969
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:58,600
Then when you're done, grab the brush

970
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,000
and give her a nice scrub.

971
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:27,050
I'm sorry.

972
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:30,720
I got it.

973
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:35,789
Let me pet.

974
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:37,390
Let me, I'm too close, but so far away.

975
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:38,270
Let me pet the horse.

976
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:44,270
Oh, yes, that was a, let me, yes.

977
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:48,109
That was a loading screen to pull out a splinter

978
01:19:48,109 --> 01:19:50,029
to go to a loading screen for a cutscene.

979
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,189
I'm just, I'm just like, I hate playing this game now.

980
01:20:06,189 --> 01:20:07,710
I need to know what's in it.

981
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:08,189
I have to know.

982
01:20:11,449 --> 01:20:13,930
Connect doesn't sound like such a good idea anymore, does it?

983
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:17,199
Poison from the devourer's attack is spreading quickly.

984
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:28,890
All right, after this stream is over,

985
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:30,409
I'm going to drop kick the connect

986
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,970
and see how far I can punt it on the football field.

987
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,210
I think I could get it, I think I could get it 30 yards.

988
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,210
I think I could, at least 20.

989
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:41,149
I need you to be strong now, girl.

990
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:43,720
We should leave now.

991
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,520
You have to hang on.

992
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,840
At least 15.

993
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,439
I think I could get it at least 10 to 15.

994
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,529
You give me a big enough shoe.

995
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:54,250
I think I could do it.

996
01:20:54,970 --> 01:21:05,260
I'm having fun though.

997
01:21:05,979 --> 01:21:07,260
We're almost there.

998
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,140
Follow this road.

999
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:10,810
Oh, no.

1000
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,159
Then you must keep on moving.

1001
01:21:15,159 --> 01:21:16,439
The poison is spreading.

1002
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:22,539
What happens if it finds us again?

1003
01:21:22,539 --> 01:21:24,140
The choice will have to be made.

1004
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,340
What is on the back of this box?

1005
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:26,300
To fight.

1006
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,100
Fight? What chance would we have against that thing?

1007
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,220
After what happened back there?

1008
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:36,640
Beware the magic.

1009
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,640
The fate of Albion is in your hands.

1010
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:43,600
Your easygoing nomadic life is forever altered when you suddenly become successor to vast

1011
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,800
and mysterious powers.

1012
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:52,270
Set off to uncover the evil that threatens the land as you learn to control your growing magic

1013
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,529
and bring to bear the power that will decide the future of Albion.

1014
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:57,050
The power is in your hands.

1015
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:00,890
Use your hands to quickly craft and wield magic in ways never dreamed possible.

1016
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:05,239
Plunge into deep and immersive gameplay in your journey to save Albion.

1017
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:08,840
Travel through the world of Albion in the best looking fable game of all time.

1018
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,640
That's not real.

1019
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,159
We've rid a horse for an hour.

1020
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:17,659
We are still alive.

1021
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,449
What it should read, what it should say is

1022
01:22:25,949 --> 01:22:29,710
use your magical hands to brush the horse back and forth four times.

1023
01:22:30,989 --> 01:22:33,789
Lean into the stunning beauty of removing a splinter.

1024
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:45,630
I bet you we cast one spell in the next 45 minutes and I want to be certain of it.

1025
01:22:46,109 --> 01:22:50,829
Follow the stream, Gabriel.

1026
01:22:50,829 --> 01:22:51,550
He hates it.

1027
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:59,050
Is she gonna make it?

1028
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,130
You can see the future.

1029
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:02,329
See is know everything, right?

1030
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:04,090
See is know everything.

1031
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:08,010
The injury that Devourer dealt me appears to have clouded my vision.

1032
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:08,890
We have a chance.

1033
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:16,409
That's such a funny, like, mysterious fantasy cop out.

1034
01:23:16,409 --> 01:23:17,369
Oh, I'm a seer.

1035
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:17,930
Oh, yes.

1036
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:24,649
If we don't get there in exactly 14 minutes, yes, the poison will get her.

1037
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:25,850
Like, a seer can see.

1038
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:29,449
Oh, yes, there's great evil coming in the next hour of gameplay.

1039
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:30,329
Evil on the way.

1040
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:30,970
I'm a seer.

1041
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:31,449
I can see it.

1042
01:23:32,569 --> 01:23:33,609
I want to see her to be wrong.

1043
01:23:35,739 --> 01:23:39,020
I want to see her to be like, oh, the great and powerful evil is upon us.

1044
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:41,180
It will be here in two days.

1045
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,579
Oh, it's got big horns.

1046
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:44,380
And it's like a squirrel.

1047
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:48,000
And it's like, holy shit, that was a fucking squirrel.

1048
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,039
You were completely wrong.

1049
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,640
And then they disappeared.

1050
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,520
They're gone the next day.

1051
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,279
That character is gone because they know they fucked it all up and they left.

1052
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,000
And you prepare, like, a week for this monster.

1053
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:06,010
Namely guy did that.

1054
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:10,989
I thought my fly was down.

1055
01:24:16,569 --> 01:24:20,409
Yeah, you ever see somebody seated getting up that fast and walking at you?

1056
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:21,210
Oh, get out of there.

1057
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:22,890
You got to get out of the fucking way.

1058
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:23,529
You know what I mean?

1059
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:26,760
Like, it's like, dog, I'm getting out of the way.

1060
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,399
Get out of the way quick.

1061
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:31,020
This guy got up really fast.

1062
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:35,789
In the right hands can grant great power to heal or to destroy.

1063
01:24:35,789 --> 01:24:36,829
You hear that, Seren?

1064
01:24:36,829 --> 01:24:38,270
We'll have you better before you know it.

1065
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:43,100
Karma, the fly was open.

1066
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,659
I must warn you, Gabriel.

1067
01:24:45,659 --> 01:24:48,489
Power to save your horse will come at a price.

1068
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:49,529
Then I'll pay it.

1069
01:24:49,529 --> 01:24:50,569
Anything to save Seren.

1070
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,449
Very well.

1071
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:55,069
This horse is dead.

1072
01:24:55,069 --> 01:24:56,270
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1073
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,710
The horse is going to die in 10 seconds.

1074
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,029
He's dead.

1075
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,560
Leave the animal here.

1076
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,880
Don't be afraid.

1077
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:25,239
No evil can approach the pool.

1078
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:28,920
Uh, guy, my connect seat, it's not calibrated.

1079
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:29,960
It doesn't think I'm sitting here.

1080
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,159
I'm here.

1081
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:31,479
I'm here.

1082
01:25:31,479 --> 01:25:32,520
I'm here.

1083
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,000
I'm here.

1084
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,199
I'm in the, I'm right here.

1085
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:34,680
God damn it.

1086
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,800
This thing, I have to recalibrate it.

1087
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,359
I'm right here.

1088
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:37,399
Oh my god damn it.

1089
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:39,640
Here, here, here, here, here, here, here.

1090
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,079
I shouldn't have done that.

1091
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:42,720
I'm gonna puke.

1092
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:48,460
That's too much spinning.

1093
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:52,380
We heroes guard the pool and the artifact that lies beneath its surface.

1094
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:55,899
Blaze, the hero of fire.

1095
01:25:55,899 --> 01:25:59,579
Stone, the hero of the fallen.

1096
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:03,069
And soul, the hero of light.

1097
01:26:03,069 --> 01:26:06,590
Great champions who long ago...

1098
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:07,090
What's her?

1099
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:14,270
Approach the pool.

1100
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:15,949
I thought that was me doing it.

1101
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:16,670
No, that isn't me.

1102
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:20,079
Gaze into the water.

1103
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:29,050
Means to heal your horseless within the water.

1104
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:34,779
I have to dunk my head.

1105
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:43,869
Reach into the pool.

1106
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:44,670
Oh my god.

1107
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,340
It's so long since I've had water.

1108
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,640
Understand.

1109
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:51,819
What is this?

1110
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:53,899
I don't carry much.

1111
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:59,739
I like to play in water.

1112
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:12,859
No, not my horse.

1113
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:13,819
I like that horse.

1114
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:14,880
No.

1115
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:24,359
How do you sit like that?

1116
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:25,560
Wait, what?

1117
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,060
Where am I?

1118
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:28,300
Where is this, what?

1119
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,659
It wants you to sit like this?

1120
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:30,300
This is place.

1121
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,020
Welcome, Gabriel.

1122
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,979
What are they talking about?

1123
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,739
The pool has shown you a glimpse of the future.

1124
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,310
But you have been brought here to learn a greater truth.

1125
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:46,569
Your real trial is only just beginning.

1126
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:53,720
Bolt is your primary damage spell.

1127
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,760
To cast it, bring your right hand up to your shoulder,

1128
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,520
then thrust it towards your target.

1129
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,960
I look so like just lazy.

1130
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:06,600
At least it's doing the thing I said.

1131
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:20,510
Connection system must be calibrated to ensure accurate casting.

1132
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,550
Cast a spell with a statue.

1133
01:28:22,189 --> 01:28:23,550
The entire new statue will appear.

1134
01:28:25,149 --> 01:28:40,539
Good shot.

1135
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:02,479
Let me just fucking do the thing I want to do.

1136
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:11,640
You know what's weird about this?

1137
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:14,159
Casting.

1138
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:14,960
You cast spells.

1139
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,119
You can go like put your hand up and then go like this.

1140
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:20,000
Don't you feel like you'd be giving somebody directions

1141
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,600
at some point in the fucking game?

1142
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,439
It's like, oh yeah, the grocery store.

1143
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:27,039
You want to trot over down to Fairbottom.

1144
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:38,680
And then just interrupted my fucking joke.

1145
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:50,439
Whatever.

1146
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:52,840
Okay, LOL, TLDR.

1147
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:54,680
I killed a person that I was like over there

1148
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,279
because I was giving directions and pointing around.

1149
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:32,560
I'm clearly hitting this guy.

1150
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:41,680
I just hit him.

1151
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:56,350
Am I not hitting him?

1152
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:56,850
No!

1153
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:20,010
This hurts my fucking arm.

1154
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:32,569
Wait, I can do two?

1155
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:58,010
Next game, not hold on.

1156
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,489
Don't tell me I'm doing it wrong.

1157
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:24,270
I was doing it wrong.

1158
01:32:26,029 --> 01:33:02,170
Fuck, it's not even.

1159
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:20,909
I can't hit that guy.

1160
01:33:20,909 --> 01:33:21,949
I can't hit that guy.

1161
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:57,050
I can't hit him.

1162
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:58,010
I'm too close.

1163
01:33:58,010 --> 01:33:59,210
I am not too close.

1164
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:12,380
I must be dreaming.

1165
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:15,050
Why was I too close?

1166
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:21,310
No, I'm not.

1167
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:21,949
I'm not too close.

1168
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:32,800
Get me the fuck out of here.

1169
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:40,220
Actually, what did you say?

1170
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:42,600
Actually, right.

1171
01:34:43,239 --> 01:34:45,100
I can't take it anymore.

1172
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,779
Connect Resident Sleeper.

1173
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:49,390
The plot is so good.

1174
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:53,770
The nominee for 2021 Meltdown?

1175
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:54,329
No, no, no.

1176
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,609
Push is your other main spell.

1177
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:56,250
No, I'm good.

1178
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:56,729
I'm good.

1179
01:34:56,729 --> 01:34:57,770
Bless.

1180
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:01,210
Raise your left hand up to your shoulder, then thrust forward.

1181
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:04,409
The spell will knock back your enemies, stunning them

1182
01:35:04,409 --> 01:35:06,409
so they cannot attack for a short while.

1183
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:06,970
Stunning.

1184
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:09,850
It can also be used to manipulate the environment.

1185
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:32,520
Am I not getting a sword?

1186
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:51,770
I don't know how many people on Christmas morning

1187
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:52,729
sat here doing this.

1188
01:35:52,729 --> 01:35:58,489
They have a lot of brain power to do this.

1189
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,039
I want to know the collective brain power

1190
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:04,960
on Christmas morning, everybody doing this.

1191
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,060
Dad, did you figure it out yet?

1192
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:09,180
I can't say.

1193
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,100
I'm trying to get the calibration to work, son.

1194
01:36:12,409 --> 01:36:13,449
This thing is wild.

1195
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:15,710
It actually knows where my hand is.

1196
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,680
Oh, I got it.

1197
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,319
You want to try, son?

1198
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:28,600
Am I really doing it?

1199
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,100
No.

1200
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,439
Are you sure?

1201
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:31,399
I don't know what's happening.

1202
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:32,359
No, not really.

1203
01:36:32,359 --> 01:36:33,880
Will, the power of magic.

1204
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:34,920
It's a lot of fun.

1205
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,399
Ran through the veins of the ancient hero.

1206
01:36:37,399 --> 01:36:38,600
Internal monologue going here.

1207
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,079
This must be like a $200 fucking add-on.

1208
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,399
You don't want to try it?

1209
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,159
I'll be in my room playing my PlayStation.

1210
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:48,670
Oh.

1211
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:51,310
The push spell can be used to throw enemies and bits.

1212
01:36:51,310 --> 01:36:52,829
I'll call you in when I get it.

1213
01:36:52,829 --> 01:36:54,029
I think I get to a cool part.

1214
01:36:54,029 --> 01:36:55,789
You can hang out with me.

1215
01:36:55,789 --> 01:36:58,029
And once it is connected, sweep your hand

1216
01:36:58,029 --> 01:36:59,550
in the direction you want to throw.

1217
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:23,369
Come on, man.

1218
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:26,909
Come on.

1219
01:37:26,909 --> 01:37:27,869
I got to do this.

1220
01:37:27,869 --> 01:37:29,710
Me and my son are going to hang out together.

1221
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:54,890
Got it.

1222
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:55,609
I got it.

1223
01:37:55,609 --> 01:37:57,239
Wow.

1224
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:58,359
Oh, I can move it around.

1225
01:38:00,569 --> 01:38:02,970
I can move this thing around if I move my arm around.

1226
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,800
Oh, this sure is fun.

1227
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,560
The push spell can be used to throw enemies

1228
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:09,479
and bits of the environment through the air.

1229
01:38:10,119 --> 01:38:12,359
Cast push with your left hand normally.

1230
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:14,520
And once it is connected, sweep your hand.

1231
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,399
Oh, what's that?

1232
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:16,039
What's that, honey?

1233
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:18,520
We got Snickers ice cream bars too in the freezer?

1234
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:23,100
Hey, Dad.

1235
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:23,819
Oh, hey, son.

1236
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:25,579
Come sit down.

1237
01:38:25,579 --> 01:38:26,140
Come sit down.

1238
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,579
Come sit right next to me.

1239
01:38:27,579 --> 01:38:28,699
Yeah, you see what I got here?

1240
01:38:28,699 --> 01:38:30,140
The push spell can be used to throw enemies

1241
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,939
and bits of the environment through the air.

1242
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:34,859
Cast push with your left hand normally.

1243
01:38:41,319 --> 01:38:41,960
Dad, get it.

1244
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,359
I got it, son.

1245
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:50,199
Ow.

1246
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:52,199
Whoa, yeah, that was crazy what I just did.

1247
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:53,960
I could make it fly with my hand.

1248
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:00,880
You want to try?

1249
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,239
No.

1250
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,479
Can I have another Snickers ice cream bar?

1251
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:09,479
Um, yes.

1252
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:10,119
Yes, you can.

1253
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:11,640
Really?

1254
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:12,439
Yes, you can.

1255
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,359
Honey, don't.

1256
01:39:14,359 --> 01:39:15,079
He's had three.

1257
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:18,510
How many are in a box?

1258
01:39:19,149 --> 01:39:20,750
There are only four in a box.

1259
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:21,630
It's bullshit.

1260
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:26,890
All right, how about you can have one more, son.

1261
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:29,369
Why don't you take a look at what your dear old dad can do here.

1262
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:42,920
Okay, I think I'm done.

1263
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:43,960
I'm done watching.

1264
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:44,460
What?

1265
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,109
No more ice cream to keep up here.

1266
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:53,279
Connect.

1267
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:54,640
Rack.

1268
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:39,800
How do I get the fuck out of here?

1269
01:40:42,989 --> 01:40:44,510
Actually, I have a little sore.

1270
01:40:45,869 --> 01:40:54,279
I'll get it.

1271
01:40:54,279 --> 01:40:54,920
I'll get it.

1272
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,750
I'll get it.

1273
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:57,630
Don't worry, son.

1274
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,159
Don't worry.

1275
01:40:59,159 --> 01:40:59,659
I'll get it.

1276
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,260
Skeleton.

1277
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,520
What's that?

1278
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,039
Why is there a skeleton on the couch?

1279
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:12,029
Honey?

1280
01:41:12,489 --> 01:41:19,420
How long has it been that I've been sitting here for?

1281
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:24,729
How long has it been?

1282
01:41:25,289 --> 01:41:29,930
Is there a skeleton over there?

1283
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:41,710
I'm done.

1284
01:41:41,710 --> 01:42:05,359
All right, wait.

1285
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:12,439
Is it time to play Let's Cheer?

1286
01:42:12,439 --> 01:42:16,960
Is it time to play Let's Cheer?

1287
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:23,319
I'll be right back.

1288
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:28,939
I'm gonna get some water.

1289
01:42:28,939 --> 01:42:30,939
That was absolutely fucking dreadful.

1290
01:42:30,939 --> 01:42:34,619
I'll be right back.

1291
01:42:34,619 --> 01:45:53,239
You know, I talked a lot of shit about, uh, about that game.

1292
01:45:53,239 --> 01:45:55,159
The more that I thought about it when I had a glass of water,

1293
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,880
you know, the more that I think the Connect has a peripheral.

1294
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:07,550
It's probably so limited that it'd be like trying to code Skyrim on an Atari.

1295
01:46:08,189 --> 01:46:11,560
You kind of just can't.

1296
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:19,319
Like, what can we have people do?

1297
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,039
Okay, they can wave their hands in the air,

1298
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:26,060
and it can recognize their face,

1299
01:46:27,949 --> 01:46:32,199
and it has a microphone.

1300
01:46:32,199 --> 01:46:34,760
So if you make noises, it can tell.

1301
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:39,550
Is there copyright music in this?

1302
01:46:40,189 --> 01:46:41,949
I feel like I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble.

1303
01:46:41,949 --> 01:46:43,609
We're about to find out.

1304
01:46:45,659 --> 01:46:46,619
I need to tune this.

1305
01:46:46,619 --> 01:46:47,899
Move this out of the way.

1306
01:46:47,899 --> 01:46:51,800
There's probably a shitload of copyrighted music in here.

1307
01:46:51,800 --> 01:47:00,409
Is this the correct gamer?

1308
01:47:00,409 --> 01:47:00,970
All right, here we go.

1309
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:14,880
Okay, it's called Cheers.

1310
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,449
The correct gamer?

1311
01:47:17,449 --> 01:47:17,770
It is.

1312
01:47:18,409 --> 01:47:22,720
It's called Let's Cheer.

1313
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:30,060
Ready to save.

1314
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:34,729
All right, this is going to be probably very embarrassing.

1315
01:47:34,729 --> 01:47:36,090
All right, so let's squad captain.

1316
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:36,810
Here's where you pick your squad captain.

1317
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:38,489
This is the person who stands up front,

1318
01:47:38,489 --> 01:47:41,770
and you'll need to watch and follow her exact moves when you're doing the routines.

1319
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,090
Okay.

1320
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:43,369
Once you choose your captain,

1321
01:47:43,369 --> 01:47:45,369
select the confirm button to pick your squad's color.

1322
01:47:45,369 --> 01:47:48,840
Megan, Brianna, or Hayley.

1323
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,739
Okay.

1324
01:47:51,739 --> 01:47:56,909
I just broke the Kinect.

1325
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:02,569
What did I say?

1326
01:48:02,569 --> 01:48:03,369
I've seen a lot of Megan.

1327
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:05,210
I've seen a lot of Megan.

1328
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:07,739
All right, Megan's captain.

1329
01:48:08,619 --> 01:48:10,619
Confirm.

1330
01:48:10,619 --> 01:48:12,939
The other two are locked.

1331
01:48:14,539 --> 01:48:15,500
Squad colors.

1332
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:16,859
Go ahead and pick any of the colors on the right.

1333
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:19,579
Both your colors and squad captain can be changed at any time,

1334
01:48:19,579 --> 01:48:21,260
so feel free to mix it up later on.

1335
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,119
Go.

1336
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,680
Selecting Cheers will get us started.

1337
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,239
Cheers?

1338
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:33,359
Extras is where you can see all your current stats, awards,

1339
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:34,239
and have some options to...

1340
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,239
Okay.

1341
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,520
Local, district, state, regionals, nationals.

1342
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,039
There are five different levels of competition.

1343
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:43,520
Local levels will have the easiest chance and dance routines,

1344
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,520
where the national level will contain the hardest.

1345
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,239
Right now, the national level of competition is closed to you,

1346
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:49,840
but all of the levels are open.

1347
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,279
You can pick any level you would like.

1348
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:51,760
Okay.

1349
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,560
Well, I'll go first.

1350
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:57,279
There are several chants and two dance routines to pick from on your right.

1351
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:00,640
Some items are locked and will be unlocked as you do well in the corresponding sections.

1352
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,439
Shoot for two.

1353
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:02,159
Celebration.

1354
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,159
Now choose one that sounds good to you, and we can get started.

1355
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:05,920
Okay.

1356
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,880
Defense up.

1357
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:14,970
Local football.

1358
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:16,810
This is a great football chant to start with.

1359
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:19,210
It has simple movements that should be easy for you to do.

1360
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:21,369
Great.

1361
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:23,289
Let's just find out how to do it first.

1362
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:25,529
So loud.

1363
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:28,270
Here comes DMCA.

1364
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:28,590
Is it?

1365
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:34,590
Are we going to get DMCA?

1366
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:37,789
Six, seven, eight.

1367
01:49:37,789 --> 01:49:38,590
Defense.

1368
01:49:39,149 --> 01:49:39,789
Attack.

1369
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:40,909
It's slow.

1370
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:41,630
Push.

1371
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:41,789
Defense.

1372
01:49:41,789 --> 01:49:42,189
Back.

1373
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:42,989
Offense.

1374
01:49:42,989 --> 01:49:43,310
Back.

1375
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:44,840
Defense.

1376
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:45,880
Defense.

1377
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:46,039
Attack.

1378
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:46,920
Do I have to sing it too?

1379
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,199
Push.

1380
01:49:48,199 --> 01:49:48,680
This is so slow.

1381
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,880
That offense back.

1382
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:50,760
This needs to be faster.

1383
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,279
It needs to be defense.

1384
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:52,680
Attack.

1385
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:53,399
Attack.

1386
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:54,600
Push that offense back.

1387
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:55,399
Why is this so slow?

1388
01:49:55,399 --> 01:49:57,000
Push that offense back.

1389
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,159
Back.

1390
01:49:58,039 --> 01:50:05,399
Let's crank up the speed a bit and turn on the score feedback.

1391
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:06,199
Okay.

1392
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:08,199
Six, seven, eight.

1393
01:50:08,199 --> 01:50:09,239
Defense.

1394
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:09,800
Attack.

1395
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:11,239
Push.

1396
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:12,520
That offense back.

1397
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,680
Defense.

1398
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:15,880
Attack.

1399
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,600
Push.

1400
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:17,800
That offense back.

1401
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,960
This is like, this dude is like daycare.

1402
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,039
Defense.

1403
01:50:20,039 --> 01:50:20,520
Attack.

1404
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:24,399
Push.

1405
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,600
I have to sing it, right?

1406
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:34,380
I can't do that shit.

1407
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:39,600
I will try to get that.

1408
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,960
I'm going to wreck my pants.

1409
01:50:46,329 --> 01:50:47,609
I'm going to do that and you're going to hear...

1410
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:51,229
All right.

1411
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:52,109
Let's get fired up.

1412
01:50:59,340 --> 01:50:59,579
I'm ready.

1413
01:50:59,579 --> 01:50:59,899
Let's go.

1414
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:13,449
I'm just a fan in the audience doing their moves.

1415
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:25,079
Why is he on a giant birthday cake?

1416
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:39,739
Oh my God.

1417
01:51:39,739 --> 01:51:40,220
That hurt.

1418
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:49,609
This game's...

1419
01:51:50,649 --> 01:51:51,770
They're not that long.

1420
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,729
This is so short.

1421
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:54,359
Okay.

1422
01:51:54,359 --> 01:51:55,720
How about celebration?

1423
01:51:56,439 --> 01:51:59,079
I guess I can have the month break.

1424
01:51:59,079 --> 01:51:59,800
Nah, I'll be fine.

1425
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:05,319
Okay.

1426
01:52:05,319 --> 01:52:06,279
Um, let's train.

1427
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,390
I'm going to train and I'm going to perform.

1428
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,359
DMCA.

1429
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:11,920
DMCA.

1430
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:12,399
DMCA.

1431
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:12,640
What?

1432
01:52:20,439 --> 01:52:21,319
Wait, is this a real song?

1433
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:32,880
Why is everything moving?

1434
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,359
Oh shit.

1435
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,199
She's casting fireball.

1436
01:52:52,840 --> 01:53:18,510
This is embarrassing.

1437
01:53:19,069 --> 01:53:20,029
This is embarrassing to me.

1438
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:24,810
Clock arms.

1439
01:53:52,119 --> 01:53:52,439
Check it.

1440
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:03,000
Delete this stream.

1441
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,770
Why don't you delete that comment?

1442
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:16,750
I'm about to rip this one out too.

1443
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:17,229
This keeps...

1444
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:22,600
I'm going to go for a competition.

1445
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:26,970
We're going right to regionals.

1446
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:31,130
Okay.

1447
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,210
Okay.

1448
01:54:37,449 --> 01:54:38,010
Perform on card.

1449
01:54:41,609 --> 01:54:42,409
This is for regionals.

1450
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:45,050
I can't do Mickey.

1451
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,010
I'm going to get arrested.

1452
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:48,600
If I do Mickey, I'm going to get arrested

1453
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:49,560
because I got DMCA.

1454
01:54:50,680 --> 01:55:08,640
I'm just the guy in the front row on drugs.

1455
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,109
The concert.

1456
01:55:18,649 --> 01:55:19,770
That's not that long.

1457
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:21,449
It needs to be much longer than that.

1458
01:55:22,409 --> 01:55:26,359
It's like, oh, that guy is...

1459
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:26,920
Oh, wait a minute.

1460
01:55:34,029 --> 01:55:35,149
I was trying to get...

1461
01:55:35,149 --> 01:55:35,949
I was trying to get in the...

1462
01:55:41,449 --> 01:55:44,409
Somebody like snatched me.

1463
01:55:44,409 --> 01:55:45,609
Somebody snatched me.

1464
01:55:45,609 --> 01:55:46,649
I was in the middle

1465
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:47,850
and like before they took the photo,

1466
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,449
somebody like fucking snatched me

1467
01:55:49,449 --> 01:55:50,010
and pulled me.

1468
01:55:51,369 --> 01:55:52,810
Look at that mouth.

1469
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:01,710
I can't even look at it.

1470
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:09,899
Yeah, keep that cover.

1471
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:11,500
For sure.

1472
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,859
Enough is enough.

1473
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:15,739
What?

1474
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:27,119
I'm going to get arrested.

1475
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,159
How about be aggressive?

1476
01:56:31,449 --> 01:56:31,609
Oh.

1477
01:56:36,810 --> 01:56:38,890
That's like a disconnected job.

1478
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:40,329
It's like a cryptid.

1479
01:56:40,329 --> 01:56:41,609
What the fuck is a cryptid?

1480
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:43,020
All right.

1481
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:43,420
I'm ready.

1482
01:56:47,390 --> 01:56:51,079
Be aggressive.

1483
01:56:51,079 --> 01:56:55,159
B-E-A-G-R-E-S-I-V-E.

1484
01:56:57,159 --> 01:56:57,949
Aggressive.

1485
01:56:59,149 --> 01:56:59,789
Aggressive.

1486
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,710
B-E-A-G-G-R-E-S-I-V-E.

1487
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:04,350
I'm so...

1488
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:06,510
I'm the fucking annoying person at the concert.

1489
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:07,229
I can't get over it.

1490
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:13,869
B-E-E-A-G-G-R-E-E-S-S-I-V-E.

1491
01:57:13,869 --> 01:57:14,510
Go get him.

1492
01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:23,920
Come on.

1493
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,760
I'm ready.

1494
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,960
There was no photo?

1495
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:33,470
Oh, there was no photo.

1496
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,159
Make the sus face.

1497
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:44,319
No.

1498
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:49,310
Do Mickey.

1499
01:57:49,310 --> 01:57:49,869
Oh my God.

1500
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:50,829
I want to do this.

1501
01:57:50,829 --> 01:57:52,109
Disturbia is so bad.

1502
01:57:52,109 --> 01:57:52,670
Cheers here.

1503
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:54,189
Start to separate the good groups from the bad ones.

1504
01:57:54,189 --> 01:57:55,550
I want to do Disturbia.

1505
01:57:55,550 --> 01:57:57,069
So fucking bad.

1506
01:57:57,069 --> 01:57:58,590
But I'm gonna get in trouble if I do.

1507
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:59,949
Let's share and let's show them what we got.

1508
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:07,689
It's a cover?

1509
01:58:07,689 --> 01:58:08,329
That don't matter.

1510
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:26,600
You want the song?

1511
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:31,319
Just sing over it.

1512
01:58:31,319 --> 01:58:31,800
Okay, fine.

1513
01:58:40,729 --> 01:58:41,770
Here we go.

1514
01:58:42,409 --> 01:58:44,029
Wait.

1515
01:58:44,029 --> 01:58:44,270
Wait.

1516
01:58:44,909 --> 01:58:45,800
Hold on.

1517
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:47,760
All right.

1518
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:48,479
I'll do it.

1519
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:49,279
Yeah, I'm ready.

1520
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:49,600
Okay.

1521
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:53,100
So it's like...

1522
01:58:55,739 --> 01:58:56,140
I got it.

1523
01:59:19,739 --> 01:59:23,260
This is the lyrics.

1524
01:59:49,739 --> 02:00:07,949
This is how they do it when they choreograph, by the way.

1525
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:09,689
The person...

1526
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:10,489
I don't even care.

1527
02:00:10,489 --> 02:00:11,609
I don't even give a shit.

1528
02:00:11,609 --> 02:00:12,010
I don't care.

1529
02:00:12,010 --> 02:00:14,329
You have to hear that.

1530
02:00:14,329 --> 02:00:14,810
When you...

1531
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:17,289
When choreographers are doing a dance routine,

1532
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:19,770
to the beat, they go like...

1533
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:21,689
And that's when we get those two arms up

1534
02:00:22,329 --> 02:00:24,569
and you swing with the back shake.

1535
02:00:24,569 --> 02:00:25,369
Step, step.

1536
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:50,350
I got a feeling.

1537
02:00:51,550 --> 02:00:53,520
What about district?

1538
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:56,989
You're losing your mind?

1539
02:00:56,989 --> 02:00:59,229
District level cheers are a step above your local.

1540
02:00:59,229 --> 02:01:01,979
They contain slightly harder movements and routines.

1541
02:01:01,979 --> 02:01:03,819
I like to move it, move it.

1542
02:01:03,819 --> 02:01:05,020
I like to move it.

1543
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:05,739
Do Mickey.

1544
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:16,569
Why are we not allowed to have any fun anymore?

1545
02:01:17,369 --> 02:01:26,430
I would love to do I like to move it, move it.

1546
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:32,029
But somewhere there's somebody with a giant fucking cigar

1547
02:01:32,029 --> 02:01:33,550
that they haven't asched yet.

1548
02:01:33,550 --> 02:01:35,550
And it's just like three quarters of ash.

1549
02:01:36,189 --> 02:01:36,829
And they're just like...

1550
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:42,220
Then they take the cigars, then they...

1551
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:45,899
They ash it into their own fucking mouth.

1552
02:01:48,510 --> 02:01:49,789
Why can't we have any fun?

1553
02:01:53,529 --> 02:01:55,130
Why can't we have any fun?

1554
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:05,609
This chat has a few harder moves in it,

1555
02:02:05,609 --> 02:02:07,369
but well worth the results it will bring you

1556
02:02:07,369 --> 02:02:08,970
when your fans are on their feet.

1557
02:02:09,609 --> 02:02:10,010
Like what?

1558
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:11,050
Because you're going to hear,

1559
02:02:11,609 --> 02:02:14,090
I like to move it, move it on a live stream

1560
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:16,409
in fucking Let's Cheer the video game.

1561
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:19,880
No, no, no, no, no, they're not going to go out

1562
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:23,159
and they're not going to buy that CD from fucking 2008.

1563
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:27,800
Get out of here.

1564
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:32,159
When was the last time any of you fucking guys bought a CD?

1565
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:37,069
How many of you guys just use Spotify and like iTunes and shit?

1566
02:02:37,630 --> 02:02:42,220
Does it really matter if like I hear a song

1567
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:46,539
from like 15, 20 years ago on a Brad, Brad broadcast?

1568
02:02:49,979 --> 02:02:52,380
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody DMC'd this.

1569
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:56,510
Like this is a song that, you know, this is on...

1570
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:58,430
I have the cheer music rights.

1571
02:02:59,229 --> 02:03:01,550
Yeah, I did the Dribble Dribble Hoop Hoop song.

1572
02:03:02,430 --> 02:03:16,760
Sounds like a Wiggles song.

1573
02:03:23,069 --> 02:03:24,109
I want to get another picture.

1574
02:03:24,989 --> 02:03:26,329
I'm going back to Nationals.

1575
02:03:26,329 --> 02:03:27,210
We're doing one more.

1576
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:28,569
One more and I'm going to move on.

1577
02:03:29,369 --> 02:03:39,600
Boo Star Andy.

1578
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:43,449
Go to Regionals.

1579
02:03:44,430 --> 02:03:45,069
I want...

1580
02:03:45,069 --> 02:03:45,949
Okay, block out.

1581
02:03:45,949 --> 02:03:47,149
I'm going to try to get five stars

1582
02:03:47,149 --> 02:03:48,270
because I want to get a photo.

1583
02:03:48,829 --> 02:03:53,640
Want to chant to bring that basketball crowd into a frenzy?

1584
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,800
Learn block out and watch them rock out.

1585
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:27,550
We got four stars.

1586
02:04:27,550 --> 02:04:43,479
Why can't I get...

1587
02:04:44,039 --> 02:04:47,020
Why did I only get one photo?

1588
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:59,100
Young and old alike will be dancing in the stands

1589
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:00,779
as you perform this instant classic.

1590
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:02,859
Hey, the words.

1591
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:08,199
Okay, I'm ready.

1592
02:05:08,199 --> 02:05:08,600
Ready?

1593
02:05:09,789 --> 02:05:11,069
Okay, girls, are you ready?

1594
02:05:12,270 --> 02:05:13,310
Here we go.

1595
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:17,770
It's time for us just to do Mickey at our competition.

1596
02:05:21,239 --> 02:05:22,039
No, no, no.

1597
02:05:22,039 --> 02:05:22,760
I'll just sing it, girls.

1598
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:23,239
Don't worry.

1599
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:35,020
Hey, without music, this looks fucking really weird.

1600
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:36,380
I look like a fucking creep.

1601
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,229
I can't do this.

1602
02:05:48,109 --> 02:05:54,890
Who can't fuck it?

1603
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:59,050
I don't give a shit.

1604
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:06,640
I do, I do, I really do.

1605
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:10,159
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

1606
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:10,880
I do, oh, I do.

1607
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:26,350
Too late.

1608
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:26,850
Oh, no.

1609
02:06:28,750 --> 02:06:34,989
I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.

1610
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:45,100
I didn't get one.

1611
02:06:57,880 --> 02:06:59,560
I'm done with the cheer game.

1612
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:07,659
It wasn't very Mickey of you.

1613
02:07:09,770 --> 02:07:10,409
You're sweating.

1614
02:07:10,409 --> 02:07:11,609
Yeah, well, I'm getting up and moving.

1615
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:24,680
What's next?

1616
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,479
Hmm.

1617
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:37,550
Oh, I know.

1618
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:38,270
Take a shower?

1619
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:39,310
Hold on, not yet.

1620
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:46,699
Star Wars Connect?

1621
02:07:46,699 --> 02:07:47,899
I can't even play that one either.

1622
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:54,750
Do an armpit check?

1623
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:55,390
No, thank you.

1624
02:07:55,949 --> 02:08:06,920
No, thank you.

1625
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,840
This one is called UFC Trainer.

1626
02:08:12,409 --> 02:08:13,449
Oh, come on.

1627
02:08:13,449 --> 02:08:14,489
Update in progress.

1628
02:08:15,289 --> 02:08:30,300
I have a tantrum.

1629
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,479
In the sea of comments, I saw somebody say, you're an adult.

1630
02:08:35,199 --> 02:08:42,380
A lot of text.

1631
02:08:45,899 --> 02:08:47,420
I can't be an adult and use the Kinect.

1632
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:48,460
That's what they made this for.

1633
02:08:50,170 --> 02:08:54,569
This was made for six-year-olds and like 40-plus-year-olds.

1634
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:58,000
I fit into the category of people that want to have this.

1635
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,239
What are you talking about?

1636
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:02,079
Everyone says, oh, grandma, grandma.

1637
02:09:02,079 --> 02:09:04,569
Kinect is the grandma accessory.

1638
02:09:04,569 --> 02:09:06,729
Don't I hit the threshold of being old enough to play this?

1639
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:21,119
Yeah, oh, sad.

1640
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,579
Good company.

1641
02:09:23,579 --> 02:09:27,819
They work.

1642
02:09:27,819 --> 02:09:28,779
40-year-old streamer?

1643
02:09:28,779 --> 02:09:29,260
Not yet.

1644
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:33,000
I got some years in me here.

1645
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:35,520
All right, UFC Trainer.

1646
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:40,640
This is like a...

1647
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:43,819
All right, this is like part of my body.

1648
02:09:45,979 --> 02:09:47,979
That's in a really weird spot, too.

1649
02:09:47,979 --> 02:09:49,340
I don't like where that is.

1650
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:50,460
I don't like where that is.

1651
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:52,300
I don't like where that is.

1652
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:53,260
I don't like where this is.

1653
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:55,659
Okay, whatever.

1654
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:59,880
All right, punch to play.

1655
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,800
It's going to mess stuff up.

1656
02:10:02,439 --> 02:10:06,840
That's kind of cool.

1657
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:11,720
That was cool.

1658
02:10:12,279 --> 02:10:13,609
Why is my head so hot?

1659
02:10:14,989 --> 02:10:17,550
Why is it a thermal camera and I have like a hot brain?

1660
02:10:18,270 --> 02:10:19,470
Am I going to explode?

1661
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:23,050
What was that?

1662
02:10:23,689 --> 02:10:27,390
I have like a really like a heat.

1663
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:28,350
My head is so hot.

1664
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:41,119
Oh, you know when you have to hold it for more than a few seconds.

1665
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:41,359
That's...

1666
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:49,399
Enter your age, height, and weight, please.

1667
02:10:49,399 --> 02:10:56,670
Come on, hurry up.

1668
02:10:56,670 --> 02:11:02,319
All right, that's...

1669
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:04,300
Oh.

1670
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:08,430
Would you like to use weights during your workout?

1671
02:11:11,289 --> 02:11:12,649
Should I lie and just say I'm doing it?

1672
02:11:19,689 --> 02:11:24,159
Oh.

1673
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:26,079
The road to the octagon starts here.

1674
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:27,359
I'm not doing any of these.

1675
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:28,319
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1676
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:29,199
What do you mean test?

1677
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:31,930
Fitness test?

1678
02:11:32,729 --> 02:11:38,590
Take your pulse over 15 seconds.

1679
02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:38,909
What?

1680
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,539
No one...

1681
02:11:44,539 --> 02:11:45,899
I'm doing this in jeans.

1682
02:11:45,899 --> 02:11:48,619
...in maintaining a UFC body would be easy.

1683
02:11:48,619 --> 02:11:50,680
It takes a lot of hard work.

1684
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:51,239
It also takes...

1685
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,439
A lot of hard work.

1686
02:11:52,439 --> 02:11:55,880
...preparing properly will not only result.

1687
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:57,399
It'll reduce your chance of injury.

1688
02:11:57,479 --> 02:11:59,319
So what kind of preparation am I talking about?

1689
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:05,289
What happened to my fucking fitness DVD?

1690
02:12:05,289 --> 02:12:05,609
I don't know.

1691
02:12:05,609 --> 02:12:06,329
What was it?

1692
02:12:06,329 --> 02:12:06,890
I need to know.

1693
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:12,510
Oh, so this is what I'm talking about.

1694
02:12:12,510 --> 02:12:15,229
Oh, we're over here now.

1695
02:12:15,949 --> 02:12:20,600
Oh, you burnt the CD.

1696
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,560
You burnt the CD.

1697
02:12:22,359 --> 02:12:25,079
You burnt the DVD, but you took it out before it was done burning.

1698
02:12:25,079 --> 02:12:27,239
So I only got the first like fucking 12 seconds.

1699
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:31,159
...in front of the Kinect with your body facing sideways toward the sensor.

1700
02:12:31,159 --> 02:12:33,720
Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.

1701
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,369
You just...

1702
02:12:37,369 --> 02:12:40,920
Oh, I have to lie.

1703
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,279
You're not going to be able to even see me.

1704
02:12:43,079 --> 02:12:51,609
How do I do this?

1705
02:12:52,729 --> 02:12:54,430
I got to move the mic.

1706
02:12:54,430 --> 02:12:55,149
The mic's got to move.

1707
02:12:55,789 --> 02:13:00,119
Why am I so hot?

1708
02:13:04,359 --> 02:13:05,239
Oh my god.

1709
02:13:05,239 --> 02:13:06,039
What's going on?

1710
02:13:15,310 --> 02:13:15,550
Okay.

1711
02:13:20,439 --> 02:13:21,640
Now for the sit-up test.

1712
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,199
Sit-up test.

1713
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:25,399
What do I need to do?

1714
02:13:25,399 --> 02:13:29,479
...on your back, knees bent, and arms crossed in front of your chest.

1715
02:13:29,479 --> 02:13:33,000
Lift your upper body up so that your elbows almost touch your knees.

1716
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,239
You'll have 60 seconds to see how many you can do.

1717
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:35,479
Okay.

1718
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,300
What's the world record?

1719
02:13:38,300 --> 02:13:38,619
Ready?

1720
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:39,659
Go.

1721
02:13:41,899 --> 02:13:42,779
60 seconds.

1722
02:13:43,659 --> 02:13:51,840
Nice.

1723
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:52,479
Yeah.

1724
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:57,850
Stop if you're tired.

1725
02:14:01,949 --> 02:14:08,329
I'm getting thrown out of the gym.

1726
02:14:09,449 --> 02:14:12,829
30 seconds left.

1727
02:14:16,829 --> 02:14:17,550
Looking good.

1728
02:14:26,989 --> 02:14:27,949
Stop if you're tired.

1729
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:32,250
I got it.

1730
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:32,810
20 seconds left.

1731
02:14:33,609 --> 02:14:40,859
I got to get to 20.

1732
02:14:40,859 --> 02:14:41,500
Okay, stop.

1733
02:14:42,829 --> 02:14:43,229
Whoo.

1734
02:14:45,210 --> 02:14:49,289
Lower your body into a plank position with your head facing the connect sensor.

1735
02:14:49,289 --> 02:14:51,850
Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.

1736
02:14:55,229 --> 02:14:55,869
Okay.

1737
02:14:55,869 --> 02:15:01,800
Push-up test.

1738
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,810
I'm going to try to get 100.

1739
02:15:04,810 --> 02:15:07,770
...with hands slightly wider than shoulder width apart.

1740
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:09,050
I hope I can flat my weight.

1741
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:10,170
...attractive.

1742
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:12,649
Head looking down and slightly ahead of you.

1743
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:17,850
Slowly lower your chest to the ground, keeping your body rigid.

1744
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:18,970
Do you guys even see me?

1745
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:20,800
...push back to plank.

1746
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:23,199
You've got one minute to try to do as many as you can.

1747
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:25,600
All right, you ready?

1748
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,760
Ready?

1749
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:27,399
Go.

1750
02:15:27,399 --> 02:15:30,060
60 seconds.

1751
02:15:31,180 --> 02:15:39,560
Bring it.

1752
02:15:43,310 --> 02:15:45,100
Stop if you're tired.

1753
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:49,770
Keep it going.

1754
02:15:51,130 --> 02:15:51,689
I just want to...

1755
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:54,800
Awesome.

1756
02:15:57,229 --> 02:16:00,170
30 seconds left.

1757
02:16:01,289 --> 02:16:03,529
I got to hit the spot where it thinks I'm moving up and down.

1758
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:04,750
Again.

1759
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:20,060
I can't do any more.

1760
02:16:20,060 --> 02:16:20,859
I can't do any more.

1761
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:22,300
I can't do any more.

1762
02:16:25,079 --> 02:16:25,579
Okay.

1763
02:16:29,449 --> 02:16:30,090
22.

1764
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:35,120
Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.

1765
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,079
Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.

1766
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:39,840
For these?

1767
02:16:40,459 --> 02:16:43,450
Okay, last test.

1768
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:45,770
We need your active heart rate.

1769
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:48,909
We're going to do some jumping jacks to get your heart rate up.

1770
02:16:48,909 --> 02:16:52,110
Let your arms hang at your side with your feet shoulder width apart.

1771
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:54,700
Oh no, it's opposite.

1772
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:57,500
Jump, bringing your arms up and spreading your legs.

1773
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:00,219
We're going to do this for one minute to get your heart pumping.

1774
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:03,420
Once we are done with the jumping jacks, I want you to check your pulse again.

1775
02:17:03,420 --> 02:17:04,459
I'll tell you when.

1776
02:17:04,459 --> 02:17:05,180
I don't know how to do that.

1777
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:05,680
Ready?

1778
02:17:06,299 --> 02:17:06,799
Go.

1779
02:17:08,700 --> 02:17:09,500
60 seconds.

1780
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:19,090
Good.

1781
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:21,600
That's a four.

1782
02:17:23,639 --> 02:17:24,600
Stop if you're tired.

1783
02:17:33,469 --> 02:17:34,409
Then do it.

1784
02:17:37,639 --> 02:17:39,690
30 seconds left.

1785
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:42,670
Hey.

1786
02:17:43,479 --> 02:17:43,959
Hey, can I...

1787
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:44,360
Oh, okay.

1788
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:45,159
All right, all right, all right.

1789
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:54,969
If you're tired.

1790
02:17:54,969 --> 02:17:59,680
10 seconds left.

1791
02:18:04,250 --> 02:18:04,750
70.

1792
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:06,940
Woo.

1793
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,520
Now I'm going to count down from 15.

1794
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:12,600
I want you to count how many times you feel a beat.

1795
02:18:13,799 --> 02:18:14,760
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1796
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:15,319
All right, I'm ready.

1797
02:18:17,709 --> 02:18:18,209
Three.

1798
02:18:18,670 --> 02:18:19,170
Two.

1799
02:18:19,629 --> 02:18:20,129
One.

1800
02:18:20,510 --> 02:18:21,010
Go.

1801
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:24,120
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1802
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,329
Well, 30, 40, 50, 60.

1803
02:18:26,329 --> 02:18:28,989
Ready to roll?

1804
02:18:28,989 --> 02:18:30,489
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1805
02:18:32,670 --> 02:18:35,500
Nine, 15, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1806
02:18:35,500 --> 02:18:36,000
15.

1807
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:36,500
15.

1808
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:37,000
Stop.

1809
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,459
Please input the amount of beats you count.

1810
02:18:46,459 --> 02:18:46,959
Just like...

1811
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,540
My heart would fucking fly away.

1812
02:18:51,180 --> 02:18:52,219
All right, what am I doing?

1813
02:18:52,219 --> 02:18:52,719
Five.

1814
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:56,360
Hey, that didn't even win me.

1815
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:06,329
Hey, bro, uh, go to the hospital.

1816
02:19:06,329 --> 02:19:18,030
That's... wait, that's only five?

1817
02:19:18,829 --> 02:19:36,090
Here's a summary of your personal information.

1818
02:19:36,090 --> 02:19:36,649
Whatever.

1819
02:19:36,649 --> 02:19:37,690
Not one of my personal information.

1820
02:19:41,239 --> 02:19:41,739
All right.

1821
02:19:43,239 --> 02:19:43,739
Activity.

1822
02:19:45,639 --> 02:19:46,139
No.

1823
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:49,659
All right, hit the mitts.

1824
02:19:50,459 --> 02:19:54,319
I can't with your speed bag.

1825
02:19:54,319 --> 02:19:55,280
That's going to be so much fun.

1826
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:56,159
Select a fighter.

1827
02:19:58,620 --> 02:19:59,260
Dan Hardy.

1828
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:03,520
Select a routine.

1829
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:05,360
Uh, we're going to go with...

1830
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:06,239
I can do better than that.

1831
02:20:09,879 --> 02:20:10,379
Really?

1832
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:18,090
All right, we're going to do easy routine five.

1833
02:20:35,959 --> 02:20:37,000
Oh, wait, wait, I got to do that too.

1834
02:20:38,889 --> 02:20:46,250
Stand in front of the Kinect with your body facing toward the sensor.

1835
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:48,889
Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.

1836
02:20:51,819 --> 02:20:52,379
What's up?

1837
02:20:52,379 --> 02:20:53,420
I'm Dan Hardy.

1838
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:54,540
Let's work focus bits.

1839
02:20:56,569 --> 02:20:58,809
All right, we're going to do some jabs and crosses.

1840
02:20:58,809 --> 02:20:59,850
Mixing it up with hooks.

1841
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:00,350
All right.

1842
02:21:00,489 --> 02:21:02,010
A few kicks and some knees.

1843
02:21:02,010 --> 02:21:02,510
And some knees.

1844
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:03,389
To keep you on your toes.

1845
02:21:03,389 --> 02:21:05,309
I'm going to give you something to dodge every now and then.

1846
02:21:05,309 --> 02:21:05,809
All right.

1847
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:07,790
Are you ready to train like a champ?

1848
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:08,290
Oh.

1849
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:10,760
Jab.

1850
02:21:12,659 --> 02:21:13,159
Duck.

1851
02:21:13,299 --> 02:21:15,329
Take a bit more now.

1852
02:21:15,329 --> 02:21:15,829
No.

1853
02:21:15,829 --> 02:21:16,610
Keep moving.

1854
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:17,110
Kick.

1855
02:21:18,059 --> 02:21:18,559
Jab.

1856
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:24,159
You need to pick it up a bit.

1857
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:24,659
Jab.

1858
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:25,780
Jab.

1859
02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:26,819
Duck.

1860
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:29,920
Kick.

1861
02:21:30,459 --> 02:21:30,959
Jab.

1862
02:21:30,959 --> 02:21:36,100
That's how we do it.

1863
02:21:37,379 --> 02:21:37,879
Jab.

1864
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:38,680
Cross.

1865
02:21:38,739 --> 02:21:40,239
Hook.

1866
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:40,780
I got an idea.

1867
02:21:41,180 --> 02:21:43,020
Get it back and let's get to it.

1868
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:43,979
We're going to mix it up now.

1869
02:21:48,610 --> 02:21:49,110
Jab.

1870
02:21:49,809 --> 02:21:50,309
Jab.

1871
02:21:50,530 --> 02:21:51,030
Duck.

1872
02:21:51,809 --> 02:21:52,370
Good job.

1873
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:53,170
Way to go.

1874
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:53,670
Jab.

1875
02:21:53,969 --> 02:21:54,469
Jab.

1876
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:55,190
Duck.

1877
02:21:56,290 --> 02:21:57,409
Cross.

1878
02:21:57,790 --> 02:21:58,290
Hook.

1879
02:21:58,430 --> 02:21:58,930
Duck.

1880
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:00,600
Yes.

1881
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:01,540
That's how it's done.

1882
02:22:01,540 --> 02:22:02,040
Okay.

1883
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:02,819
Let's move on.

1884
02:22:09,469 --> 02:22:09,969
Jab.

1885
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:10,770
Duck.

1886
02:22:11,149 --> 02:22:11,950
I don't want to duck.

1887
02:22:11,950 --> 02:22:12,750
Dig deeper now.

1888
02:22:13,309 --> 02:22:13,809
Jab.

1889
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:14,450
Jab.

1890
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:15,170
Hook.

1891
02:22:15,469 --> 02:22:15,969
Knee.

1892
02:22:17,899 --> 02:22:18,399
Jab.

1893
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:19,670
Cross.

1894
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,170
Kick.

1895
02:22:21,979 --> 02:22:22,940
You missed a few there.

1896
02:22:24,659 --> 02:22:25,159
Jab.

1897
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:27,780
Hook.

1898
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:29,360
All right.

1899
02:22:29,360 --> 02:22:29,979
I'm getting tired.

1900
02:22:33,260 --> 02:22:34,059
I'm tired.

1901
02:22:34,700 --> 02:22:35,200
Jab.

1902
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:35,760
I'm tired.

1903
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:36,260
I need a break.

1904
02:22:36,620 --> 02:22:37,340
I need a break.

1905
02:22:37,340 --> 02:22:37,840
Cross.

1906
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:38,459
I need a break.

1907
02:22:39,889 --> 02:22:40,389
Kick.

1908
02:22:40,389 --> 02:22:41,090
You're not listening.

1909
02:22:41,729 --> 02:22:42,790
Hook.

1910
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:43,729
I need a fucking break, man.

1911
02:22:43,729 --> 02:22:44,229
Knee.

1912
02:22:44,690 --> 02:22:45,190
Connect.

1913
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,889
I need a break.

1914
02:22:45,889 --> 02:22:48,430
You've got to keep moving.

1915
02:22:48,430 --> 02:22:48,930
Jab.

1916
02:22:48,930 --> 02:22:49,430
Jab.

1917
02:22:49,430 --> 02:22:50,170
How am I going to take a break?

1918
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:50,670
Duck.

1919
02:22:50,670 --> 02:22:56,620
Looking good.

1920
02:22:57,340 --> 02:22:57,840
Okay.

1921
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:58,780
We're going to change it up.

1922
02:23:05,139 --> 02:23:05,639
Jab.

1923
02:23:05,860 --> 02:23:06,360
Jab.

1924
02:23:06,979 --> 02:23:07,479
Duck.

1925
02:23:07,780 --> 02:23:09,780
I think you can do better.

1926
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:10,440
Jab.

1927
02:23:10,659 --> 02:23:11,159
Let him hit me.

1928
02:23:11,159 --> 02:23:11,940
I get more rage.

1929
02:23:12,340 --> 02:23:15,889
Duck.

1930
02:23:15,889 --> 02:23:16,389
Knee.

1931
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:17,760
You really got it.

1932
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:21,600
All right.

1933
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,860
I don't know what happened.

1934
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:24,780
I guess I need to defragment my hard drive.

1935
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:27,299
What?

1936
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:35,600
I got an F.

1937
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:38,850
I only burned six calories?

1938
02:23:40,459 --> 02:23:41,659
How is that even possible?

1939
02:23:42,459 --> 02:23:42,959
What?

1940
02:23:43,420 --> 02:23:45,819
I burned like a hundred.

1941
02:23:46,459 --> 02:23:50,020
You've got to be shitting me.

1942
02:23:50,659 --> 02:24:01,020
Free striking.

1943
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:01,520
Let's go.

1944
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:05,590
Heavy bag.

1945
02:24:06,530 --> 02:24:07,809
Tiger stripes.

1946
02:24:07,809 --> 02:24:08,309
Let's go.

1947
02:24:11,459 --> 02:24:11,959
Advanced.

1948
02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:15,440
I'm advanced.

1949
02:24:16,879 --> 02:24:18,000
If I punched somebody.

1950
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:19,760
Oh boy.

1951
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:25,299
Let's go.

1952
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:35,819
Stand in front of the connect with your body facing toward the sensor.

1953
02:24:35,819 --> 02:24:38,620
Make sure your body appears green within the octagon.

1954
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:39,120
I'm green.

1955
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:44,370
Build power and endurance at your own pace and free striking mode.

1956
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:44,870
Okay.

1957
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:47,729
Work on your own combos and at your own pace.

1958
02:24:47,729 --> 02:24:49,409
The more strikes you get in the better.

1959
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:51,440
Ready?

1960
02:24:52,829 --> 02:24:53,329
Go.

1961
02:24:53,950 --> 02:25:01,860
Quick.

1962
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:29,920
Pulverize the target.

1963
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:50,750
Rise the target.

1964
02:25:54,340 --> 02:25:54,840
Come on.

1965
02:25:56,690 --> 02:25:58,129
Keep that striking pace up.

1966
02:25:59,010 --> 02:26:04,540
Strike faster.

1967
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:11,579
Don't let me down.

1968
02:26:11,579 --> 02:26:13,100
Keep attacking.

1969
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:14,239
All right.

1970
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:14,739
I'm done.

1971
02:26:17,729 --> 02:26:19,170
Keep that striking pace up.

1972
02:26:19,889 --> 02:26:26,159
Strike faster.

1973
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:28,629
All right.

1974
02:26:28,629 --> 02:26:29,729
I think I killed them.

1975
02:26:30,290 --> 02:26:31,090
I think they're dead.

1976
02:26:31,809 --> 02:26:33,969
Don't let me keep attacking.

1977
02:26:33,969 --> 02:26:37,600
You picked five minutes.

1978
02:26:38,850 --> 02:26:40,290
Keep that striking pace up.

1979
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:46,780
Strike faster.

1980
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:01,379
Keep that striking pace up.

1981
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:14,239
Strike faster.

1982
02:27:14,239 --> 02:27:15,680
It's like toilet paper roll.

1983
02:27:21,649 --> 02:27:23,090
He's got oh no he's got a fuel.

1984
02:27:24,049 --> 02:27:27,620
This thing's weight like a pound.

1985
02:27:28,260 --> 02:27:43,149
Don't let me down.

1986
02:27:43,149 --> 02:27:49,260
Keep attacking.

1987
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:50,700
Keep that striking pace up.

1988
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,219
Strike faster.

1989
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:04,180
Don't let me down.

1990
02:28:04,180 --> 02:28:10,340
Keep attacking.

1991
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:11,780
Keep that striking pace up.

1992
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:18,299
Strike faster.

1993
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:25,120
Don't let me down.

1994
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:25,620
Die.

1995
02:28:26,559 --> 02:28:32,829
Your hits are nice and quick.

1996
02:28:33,629 --> 02:28:39,649
Pulverize the target.

1997
02:28:40,290 --> 02:28:47,020
Keep that striking pace up.

1998
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,540
It's been how long I have to do this for?

1999
02:28:50,909 --> 02:28:51,870
Five full minutes?

2000
02:28:52,430 --> 02:28:53,549
I think I've been here for an hour.

2001
02:28:54,350 --> 02:28:58,690
I feel like I've been here for a full hour doing this.

2002
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:00,620
I'm getting to 30,000.

2003
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:06,750
Keep attacking.

2004
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:08,190
Keep that striking pace up.

2005
02:29:13,809 --> 02:29:14,930
Strike faster.

2006
02:29:14,930 --> 02:29:27,840
Bring that target up.

2007
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:28,719
Don't let me down.

2008
02:29:28,719 --> 02:29:31,459
Keep attacking.

2009
02:29:31,459 --> 02:29:32,260
Give it a kiss.

2010
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:36,370
Keep that striking pace up.

2011
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:40,620
It's like a ranged attack.

2012
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:42,780
Like strike faster.

2013
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:46,559
Ow.

2014
02:29:46,559 --> 02:29:55,780
It's a fucking waste of time.

2015
02:29:56,739 --> 02:29:56,899
All right.

2016
02:29:56,899 --> 02:29:58,340
How many calories did that burn?

2017
02:29:59,059 --> 02:29:59,559
What?

2018
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:03,790
16 calories?

2019
02:30:04,510 --> 02:30:08,059
That was five minutes of just fucking spinning around like a psycho.

2020
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:13,520
Five full minutes of just waving my arms around and jumping around at 16 calories?

2021
02:30:15,149 --> 02:30:15,469
What?

2022
02:30:20,290 --> 02:30:20,770
No way.

2023
02:30:21,409 --> 02:30:29,409
I feel like I burned more calories playing a horror game.

2024
02:30:29,969 --> 02:30:32,829
I swear to God.

2025
02:30:32,829 --> 02:30:35,709
I bet you I burned 40 calories an hour playing like Resident Evil.

2026
02:30:36,829 --> 02:30:39,860
All right.

2027
02:30:39,860 --> 02:30:40,739
I'm going to speed back.

2028
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:42,899
I'm getting fucking tired.

2029
02:30:44,579 --> 02:30:46,180
I'm not doing that for five goddamn minutes.

2030
02:30:53,739 --> 02:30:55,100
20 beats per minute.

2031
02:30:55,979 --> 02:31:01,329
Lied about height.

2032
02:31:01,329 --> 02:31:02,530
Lied about beats per minute.

2033
02:31:02,530 --> 02:31:03,569
No wonder it's fucked up.

2034
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:06,459
I didn't lie about height.

2035
02:31:17,090 --> 02:31:17,729
I'm going to be good at this.

2036
02:31:49,299 --> 02:32:08,620
Come on.

2037
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:09,180
I want to go.

2038
02:32:10,059 --> 02:32:14,700
I want to do it with my feet, but like I can't put my feet on camera.

2039
02:32:15,739 --> 02:32:16,989
I want to do it.

2040
02:32:16,989 --> 02:32:18,670
I'm going to put my light up, my feet up and do it.

2041
02:32:18,670 --> 02:32:20,350
But I'll you want the fuck to clip that.

2042
02:32:32,989 --> 02:32:33,790
Five calories?

2043
02:32:38,819 --> 02:32:39,059
Late?

2044
02:32:39,870 --> 02:32:40,190
When?

2045
02:32:45,299 --> 02:32:46,020
All right.

2046
02:32:46,020 --> 02:32:51,379
I think it's time to move on.

2047
02:32:58,719 --> 02:32:58,959
All right.

2048
02:32:58,959 --> 02:32:59,360
Hold on.

2049
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:00,719
I want to do tire flip.

2050
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:01,760
Wait, there's more.

2051
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:02,559
What else is in this?

2052
02:33:06,700 --> 02:33:06,940
Oh.

2053
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:13,860
All right.

2054
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:14,420
Tire flip.

2055
02:33:14,979 --> 02:33:17,950
Tire flip and then I'm moving on to...

2056
02:33:21,229 --> 02:33:22,110
Hole in the wall.

2057
02:33:22,989 --> 02:33:27,899
Oh, we're going to play hole in the wall after this one.

2058
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:28,930
One minute.

2059
02:33:28,930 --> 02:33:40,750
Pog, pog, pog.

2060
02:33:40,750 --> 02:33:41,069
Is that all?

2061
02:33:41,069 --> 02:33:41,870
I'm seeing a lot of pogs.

2062
02:33:42,430 --> 02:33:46,819
Jerma's exhausted.

2063
02:33:46,819 --> 02:33:47,059
Yeah.

2064
02:33:47,059 --> 02:33:49,540
I probably shouldn't have picked the like fucking exercise game.

2065
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,739
All the exercise games that are trying to make you like get tired.

2066
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:05,180
I don't want to do this.

2067
02:34:05,180 --> 02:34:07,180
I don't understand this.

2068
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:15,020
Dude, I'm just going to eat Cheerios and like reduce some calories and walk.

2069
02:34:15,579 --> 02:34:16,780
I'm not doing this.

2070
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:22,700
Like just eat fucking like Honey Nut Cheerios or something and walk and jog sometimes.

2071
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:24,139
I don't want to do this.

2072
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:37,549
Hole in the wall time.

2073
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:43,729
Two thousand and twelve Jerma long dead.

2074
02:34:43,729 --> 02:34:46,450
Two thousand and twelve Jerma didn't like flip monster truck tires.

2075
02:34:47,170 --> 02:34:52,399
Broken?

2076
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:57,340
Whatever.

2077
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:58,540
No, why?

2078
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:00,559
I don't want to do that.

2079
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,120
That's like Marvel character shit.

2080
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:06,559
Like you want to be a Marvel character?

2081
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:10,209
You can flip like monster truck tires.

2082
02:35:10,209 --> 02:35:11,010
You're a Marvel character.

2083
02:35:11,010 --> 02:35:12,850
You're like Captain America at that point.

2084
02:35:12,850 --> 02:35:16,319
I don't want to be Captain America.

2085
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:21,120
I want to be guy on sidewalk walking by scene that like looks kind of good.

2086
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:22,239
I don't want to be Captain America.

2087
02:35:34,430 --> 02:35:36,670
Two thousand and twelve Jerma would beat Captain America's ass.

2088
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:43,059
No, two thousand and twelve Jerma would take the shield to the head and become decapitated

2089
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:46,510
because I couldn't duck in time because I don't have superpowers.

2090
02:35:47,069 --> 02:35:50,850
I was just like a like a kind of stacked thick boy.

2091
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:54,379
My head would come off.

2092
02:35:54,379 --> 02:35:55,260
I don't have powers.

2093
02:36:00,450 --> 02:36:02,479
All right, let's go.

2094
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:08,190
Why does this font look so bad?

2095
02:36:08,190 --> 02:36:09,229
Connect tuner?

2096
02:36:09,229 --> 02:36:10,110
What's going on there?

2097
02:36:10,989 --> 02:36:18,049
Why is that in a weird font with a weird background?

2098
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:19,889
All right, let's do it.

2099
02:36:19,889 --> 02:36:20,450
Hole in the wall.

2100
02:36:21,329 --> 02:36:24,739
I'm going to do the show.

2101
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,879
It's a game show.

2102
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:27,200
Let's go.

2103
02:36:28,979 --> 02:36:29,540
Unplayer.

2104
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:35,500
Players who want to be in this team, please come over.

2105
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:37,659
Everyone else, please move away.

2106
02:36:40,579 --> 02:36:41,700
What else?

2107
02:36:41,700 --> 02:36:42,260
Get away.

2108
02:36:42,899 --> 02:36:45,649
You step into the circle to join blue team.

2109
02:36:46,370 --> 02:37:12,579
All right, let's go.

2110
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:19,709
Everyday life.

2111
02:37:19,709 --> 02:37:20,909
European workplaces.

2112
02:37:20,909 --> 02:37:22,110
Disco activities.

2113
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:25,659
Art.

2114
02:37:26,540 --> 02:37:27,420
USA.

2115
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:28,299
Oh, I can only do one.

2116
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:32,959
All right, we're going to do everyday life.

2117
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:35,620
Well, how does this game even work?

2118
02:37:36,260 --> 02:37:36,659
Why do you have to...

2119
02:37:36,659 --> 02:37:38,020
Welcome the blue team.

2120
02:37:45,569 --> 02:37:47,569
Oh, I have to get through the foam thing, the hole.

2121
02:37:48,129 --> 02:37:49,489
It's all simple.

2122
02:37:49,489 --> 02:37:54,930
Make the shape, fit the hole, and keep the pose to fill the gauge around the wall.

2123
02:37:54,930 --> 02:37:57,649
The faster you are, the bigger your score.

2124
02:37:58,370 --> 02:38:01,969
If you don't fill the gauge, you get a strike.

2125
02:38:01,969 --> 02:38:05,090
After three strikes, prepare to get wet.

2126
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:09,409
Here we go.

2127
02:38:10,209 --> 02:38:11,309
Round one.

2128
02:38:11,309 --> 02:38:11,870
Where are we going?

2129
02:38:11,870 --> 02:38:12,510
Where we got?

2130
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:14,350
I can make my fucking body any form.

2131
02:38:15,149 --> 02:38:37,440
Got it.

2132
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:49,149
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

2133
02:38:49,149 --> 02:38:51,620
Got it.

2134
02:38:52,159 --> 02:38:58,260
Got it.

2135
02:38:58,260 --> 02:39:01,219
What is this guy doing?

2136
02:39:24,159 --> 02:39:25,120
Get, get, get, get, get.

2137
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:34,479
All right, round one.

2138
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:37,100
Round two?

2139
02:39:38,059 --> 02:39:39,709
Wait, there are pictures?

2140
02:39:39,709 --> 02:39:56,450
Oh, there's junk over here.

2141
02:39:57,090 --> 02:39:59,139
Look at all this trash.

2142
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:01,700
That's supposed to be a dog bed.

2143
02:40:03,100 --> 02:40:04,299
There's a bunch of...

2144
02:40:04,299 --> 02:40:05,819
That's my VR headset.

2145
02:40:06,379 --> 02:40:07,500
And this thing's over here.

2146
02:40:08,219 --> 02:40:15,469
This is a spoiler.

2147
02:40:16,110 --> 02:40:19,760
A spoiler.

2148
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:23,059
This fucking thing.

2149
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:50,659
Come on.

2150
02:40:50,659 --> 02:40:51,780
How you doing, man?

2151
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:52,579
How are things?

2152
02:40:52,579 --> 02:40:53,780
Well, you know, things are good.

2153
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:55,819
Cool, cool, cool.

2154
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,959
You've been sitting over on the dog bed?

2155
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:00,479
Yeah.

2156
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:02,559
Well, you know, the dog bed is comfy.

2157
02:41:03,729 --> 02:41:04,770
I thought that you'd be...

2158
02:41:05,329 --> 02:41:07,010
I was going to wait to put you on stream for a little while.

2159
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:08,909
You were?

2160
02:41:09,469 --> 02:41:11,549
Yeah, I just figured it wasn't your time yet.

2161
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:13,340
Why would you do that?

2162
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:14,459
I'm ready to be on camera.

2163
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:15,739
Okay.

2164
02:41:16,299 --> 02:41:18,129
What's your name, anyways?

2165
02:41:19,069 --> 02:41:19,469
Orange.

2166
02:41:20,110 --> 02:41:20,670
Oh, easy.

2167
02:41:20,670 --> 02:41:22,590
Really easy to remember and easy to come up with on the spot

2168
02:41:22,590 --> 02:41:23,790
without having any time.

2169
02:41:23,790 --> 02:41:24,270
Cool.

2170
02:41:24,270 --> 02:41:24,989
Hi, Orange.

2171
02:41:24,989 --> 02:41:26,750
So, would you like to go back into dog bed?

2172
02:41:27,469 --> 02:41:28,510
Of course I would.

2173
02:41:28,510 --> 02:41:29,549
It's very comfy.

2174
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:32,479
Ow, ow.

2175
02:41:32,479 --> 02:41:40,930
I'll do a little bit of cleaning, okay?

2176
02:41:40,930 --> 02:41:46,860
Why am I using my mouse?

2177
02:41:47,420 --> 02:41:48,620
What else we got?

2178
02:41:48,620 --> 02:41:50,579
I'm here.

2179
02:41:50,579 --> 02:41:54,659
I think I'm here.

2180
02:41:54,659 --> 02:41:58,299
How do I get this off the screen?

2181
02:41:58,299 --> 02:42:18,959
What else we got?

2182
02:42:25,250 --> 02:42:29,440
This is so stupid.

2183
02:42:36,829 --> 02:42:38,350
Okay, you know what this looks like.

2184
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:40,270
What's that...

2185
02:42:41,069 --> 02:42:42,750
What's that kid that dances?

2186
02:42:44,659 --> 02:42:45,620
The kid that goes like...

2187
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:49,069
What is it?

2188
02:42:49,069 --> 02:42:49,469
He's like...

2189
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:53,729
That's what the first thing I thought of.

2190
02:42:53,729 --> 02:42:54,209
Dwayne.

2191
02:42:54,209 --> 02:42:54,770
That's right, yep.

2192
02:42:56,290 --> 02:42:56,690
It's like...

2193
02:42:57,250 --> 02:43:01,540
That's the first thing I thought of.

2194
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:08,659
It looks like somebody's like fucking threatening me to like...

2195
02:43:10,459 --> 02:43:12,700
Yeah, you're a dance.

2196
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:16,139
Doesn't it look like somebody's gonna fucking kill me off camera?

2197
02:43:32,450 --> 02:43:33,010
Dwayne.

2198
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:35,340
All right, let's go.

2199
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:35,979
Let's do another one.

2200
02:43:35,979 --> 02:43:36,540
This is fun.

2201
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:38,059
I like this one.

2202
02:43:40,370 --> 02:43:41,889
All right, how do we keep going?

2203
02:43:44,579 --> 02:43:46,340
No, that was close.

2204
02:43:47,139 --> 02:43:51,020
Oh, round two.

2205
02:44:02,219 --> 02:44:02,700
Round two.

2206
02:44:04,059 --> 02:44:06,530
Which one am I?

2207
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:39,280
Shit, shit, shit.

2208
02:44:40,079 --> 02:44:42,799
Okay, got it.

2209
02:44:54,159 --> 02:44:54,399
Okay.

2210
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:55,520
That was easy.

2211
02:45:17,899 --> 02:45:18,299
Jesus.

2212
02:45:19,100 --> 02:45:19,809
I got it.

2213
02:45:19,809 --> 02:45:20,690
Cleared it.

2214
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:27,739
Photos time.

2215
02:45:28,299 --> 02:45:44,049
Dump truck.

2216
02:45:52,639 --> 02:45:53,760
Oh my god.

2217
02:45:55,360 --> 02:46:09,379
It looks like I'm wearing a rubber mask of somebody else's face.

2218
02:46:09,379 --> 02:46:14,379
That's a fucking rubber mask.

2219
02:46:14,379 --> 02:46:25,360
Okay, this is just like a shitty...

2220
02:46:26,700 --> 02:46:29,659
This is one of my model photos that I uploaded.

2221
02:46:29,659 --> 02:46:32,379
It's like Instagram to show you like how a bunch of a model I could be.

2222
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:40,530
Underneath this is like there's two likes.

2223
02:46:50,239 --> 02:46:53,120
Yeah, it's my gallery, you know, my model gallery.

2224
02:46:53,680 --> 02:47:03,920
That one's not even that bad.

2225
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:09,520
This one looks kind of bad.

2226
02:47:13,309 --> 02:47:13,950
I don't like that one.

2227
02:47:13,950 --> 02:47:14,590
It's scary.

2228
02:47:15,309 --> 02:47:16,190
It's a scary image.

2229
02:47:16,989 --> 02:47:40,899
Why does it always look like somebody took like ice cold hands and like put them on my back?

2230
02:47:41,379 --> 02:47:50,639
All right, let's go again.

2231
02:47:51,739 --> 02:47:52,540
Round five.

2232
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:56,559
Round three.

2233
02:47:59,010 --> 02:48:04,219
Theresa May.

2234
02:48:08,620 --> 02:48:14,540
That's fucking perfect.

2235
02:48:22,059 --> 02:48:22,860
Oh my god.

2236
02:48:39,120 --> 02:49:03,299
I think I see when it takes the photo.

2237
02:49:03,860 --> 02:49:09,979
Did I get it?

2238
02:49:09,979 --> 02:49:45,219
Hey, I had to go all the way over to the dog bed.

2239
02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:49,389
Why was that so far away?

2240
02:49:50,270 --> 02:50:13,090
Very, very weird.

2241
02:50:13,090 --> 02:50:16,899
I look jacked.

2242
02:50:16,899 --> 02:50:18,579
I look huge in this picture.

2243
02:50:18,579 --> 02:50:28,690
What's going on with my face?

2244
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:37,280
Just the reddit shelf, just right here.

2245
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:39,760
It's the only thing in the entire fucking room.

2246
02:50:40,780 --> 02:50:42,780
It just looks so, it just looks so odd.

2247
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:47,469
There's like shit all over the floor.

2248
02:51:04,819 --> 02:51:07,620
Somebody came in the room, like the T-Rex walked in.

2249
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:09,459
It didn't matter what I was doing.

2250
02:51:09,459 --> 02:51:11,540
I had to be very still or I was dead.

2251
02:51:13,219 --> 02:51:18,500
Or you don't have a place to put your cardboard cutout of German 985.

2252
02:51:19,379 --> 02:51:23,299
I guess it's just gonna go over here and lean against the wall while I clean the fucking room.

2253
02:51:23,940 --> 02:51:29,219
Like this is, this is like you shoved the cardboard cutout of me and all your other junk

2254
02:51:29,219 --> 02:51:31,459
so you can vacuum over here.

2255
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:42,959
How is it?

2256
02:51:42,959 --> 02:51:44,079
That was the last one.

2257
02:51:44,079 --> 02:51:50,379
Here comes the final.

2258
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:51,899
See if I can get it.

2259
02:51:55,180 --> 02:51:56,620
The proudest possession.

2260
02:51:59,020 --> 02:51:59,579
New rule.

2261
02:52:06,860 --> 02:52:11,180
Which of the outline shapes are good and fit them to pass the walls as usual.

2262
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:12,059
What are you talking about?

2263
02:52:12,059 --> 02:52:13,260
Don't get confused.

2264
02:52:15,870 --> 02:52:17,389
Hole, the holes aren't visible.

2265
02:52:19,469 --> 02:52:20,590
Oh Jesus.

2266
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:39,500
Which one is it?

2267
02:52:39,500 --> 02:52:40,219
Which one is it?

2268
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:35,389
It's not this one.

2269
02:53:35,389 --> 02:53:39,700
I'm gonna fall over.

2270
02:53:50,030 --> 02:54:24,700
I can't, what?

2271
02:54:24,700 --> 02:54:26,700
Otto is gonna be in one of these pictures I think.

2272
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:29,180
Otto came in.

2273
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:45,250
Let's see if we can see Otto.

2274
02:54:45,250 --> 02:54:49,340
He like ran over here.

2275
02:54:49,340 --> 02:54:50,540
Oh my god.

2276
02:54:50,540 --> 02:54:52,059
Another cardboard cutout.

2277
02:55:02,239 --> 02:55:07,840
Just like a fucking like sprite in my hand in like the 7-Eleven.

2278
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:23,899
I'm trying to find Otto.

2279
02:55:34,959 --> 02:55:45,299
Oh if you had friends over and these were saved and like this is dad just still playing

2280
02:55:45,299 --> 02:55:45,940
with the Kinect.

2281
02:55:47,010 --> 02:55:48,770
Oh that's where I didn't, I didn't know where it was.

2282
02:55:52,030 --> 02:55:52,590
I can get it.

2283
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:53,709
I'll try it again.

2284
02:55:53,709 --> 02:55:57,950
Let's go.

2285
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:58,430
I can do it.

2286
02:55:59,069 --> 02:56:04,239
Oh the show's over.

2287
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:06,020
What?

2288
02:56:07,420 --> 02:56:08,459
Can I restart that one?

2289
02:56:12,030 --> 02:56:18,049
Oh god.

2290
02:56:18,049 --> 02:56:23,100
What the fuck?

2291
02:56:23,100 --> 02:56:23,420
Come on.

2292
02:56:27,260 --> 02:56:29,139
Next game.

2293
02:56:29,139 --> 02:56:29,780
Hold on.

2294
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:30,180
Not yet.

2295
02:56:37,229 --> 02:56:38,110
I wanna pick another one.

2296
02:56:38,750 --> 02:56:40,290
I can't believe I failed it.

2297
02:56:40,930 --> 02:56:44,030
I'm gonna blow through this.

2298
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:49,899
See if I can catch the camera.

2299
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:51,569
When does it flash?

2300
02:56:56,659 --> 02:56:57,139
Did I get it?

2301
02:57:17,229 --> 02:57:32,899
He's a reason.

2302
02:57:37,090 --> 02:57:37,809
Brick stare.

2303
02:57:40,209 --> 02:57:42,370
I'm trying to see, I guess what I'm gonna do.

2304
02:57:42,370 --> 02:57:42,690
Ready?

2305
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:51,940
No it's, when does it take the photo?

2306
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:55,200
At some point.

2307
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:56,559
I gotta, I gotta do a count.

2308
02:57:57,760 --> 02:57:59,700
Maybe three seconds after?

2309
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:11,280
All right.

2310
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:12,399
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2311
02:58:12,399 --> 02:58:13,920
I want to unlock the next one.

2312
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:24,270
I want to unlock the next challenge at least.

2313
02:58:27,139 --> 02:58:29,469
I'm gonna try as hard as I can.

2314
02:58:30,270 --> 02:58:31,680
Turns gray?

2315
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:41,790
All right, it looks like right there, right?

2316
02:58:42,590 --> 02:58:43,790
I don't think that's correct though.

2317
02:58:44,510 --> 02:59:03,540
I think it is.

2318
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:26,799
Oh!

2319
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:40,290
Oh shit.

2320
02:59:40,290 --> 02:59:40,850
I'm not gonna get it.

2321
02:59:41,489 --> 02:59:47,549
Whatever.

2322
02:59:47,629 --> 02:59:56,639
I can look to see if we can get it.

2323
02:59:57,360 --> 02:59:58,319
Is it that flash?

2324
02:59:58,319 --> 02:59:59,200
I feel like, is it?

2325
02:59:59,200 --> 02:59:59,840
Let's find out.

2326
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:00,639
Is my tongue sticking out?

2327
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:04,670
No, it's not.

2328
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:07,520
So it happens before the flash.

2329
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:13,069
It happens at some point before the flash.

2330
03:00:13,069 --> 03:00:13,870
So here's what I'm gonna do.

2331
03:00:14,590 --> 03:00:15,979
Check this out.

2332
03:00:16,940 --> 03:00:22,799
See if I can get the photo

2333
03:00:22,799 --> 03:00:23,840
and then do the actual thing.

2334
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:24,239
Here we go.

2335
03:00:24,239 --> 03:00:24,739
Ready?

2336
03:00:47,379 --> 03:00:48,340
Doesn't want me to do it.

2337
03:00:54,899 --> 03:01:03,309
See if I got it.

2338
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:32,659
All right, it was, it's very easy.

2339
03:01:33,219 --> 03:01:44,129
Come on, dude, dude.

2340
03:01:54,879 --> 03:01:55,569
All right.

2341
03:01:56,129 --> 03:01:56,770
See if I got it.

2342
03:01:57,409 --> 03:02:00,350
This dude's a gamer.

2343
03:02:00,350 --> 03:02:00,670
Thank you.

2344
03:02:01,309 --> 03:02:02,639
Appreciate that.

2345
03:02:06,399 --> 03:02:09,760
Oh, it must start to take it

2346
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:11,680
when the time, when the do, do, do, do, do, do

2347
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:12,319
thing starts.

2348
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:18,479
All right, this is it.

2349
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:19,840
This is for everything.

2350
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:20,239
Let's go.

2351
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:24,799
And now comes the final round

2352
03:02:24,799 --> 03:02:26,479
of the everyday show.

2353
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:28,239
We've added an additional rule

2354
03:02:28,239 --> 03:02:29,280
to make it harder.

2355
03:02:30,479 --> 03:02:30,639
Oh.

2356
03:02:30,639 --> 03:02:31,840
Have you ever felt lost in?

2357
03:02:33,200 --> 03:02:36,959
I'm on the shoes here.

2358
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:55,180
It's time to face the final.

2359
03:02:55,180 --> 03:02:56,379
Well done.

2360
03:02:56,379 --> 03:02:59,069
He's strangled.

2361
03:03:04,829 --> 03:03:06,030
Congratulations.

2362
03:03:22,799 --> 03:03:23,299
Nice.

2363
03:03:30,510 --> 03:03:31,010
Ah.

2364
03:04:03,389 --> 03:04:32,030
Well done.

2365
03:04:32,030 --> 03:04:32,530
Try again.

2366
03:04:33,950 --> 03:04:36,510
You are still the winning team.

2367
03:04:36,510 --> 03:04:36,829
Gray?

2368
03:04:36,829 --> 03:04:37,549
What do you mean the gray?

2369
03:04:39,059 --> 03:04:39,940
The gray shadow.

2370
03:04:41,790 --> 03:04:45,379
I, I can't see that far away from here.

2371
03:04:45,379 --> 03:04:47,379
I want to, there's a 27 inch monitor

2372
03:04:47,379 --> 03:04:49,219
and I'm like 12 feet away.

2373
03:04:49,860 --> 03:04:53,659
It's the gray silhouette.

2374
03:04:53,659 --> 03:04:54,540
That's what it is the whole time.

2375
03:04:55,100 --> 03:04:56,420
Are you fucking kidding me?

2376
03:04:57,219 --> 03:05:03,969
I want to see this one.

2377
03:05:03,969 --> 03:05:09,659
I'm like, okay, diaper?

2378
03:05:11,010 --> 03:05:12,530
I'm, I'm like, well,

2379
03:05:13,090 --> 03:05:13,729
you're supposed to play this

2380
03:05:13,729 --> 03:05:15,969
in like a fucking, in the living room.

2381
03:05:15,969 --> 03:05:17,809
This is like a 26 inch monitor

2382
03:05:17,809 --> 03:05:19,729
and I'm like fucking 15 feet away.

2383
03:05:31,979 --> 03:05:32,299
Shit.

2384
03:05:33,020 --> 03:05:41,500
Come on.

2385
03:05:42,299 --> 03:05:50,690
We're survival.

2386
03:05:54,819 --> 03:06:00,260
At least one gamer is not signed in.

2387
03:06:00,260 --> 03:06:00,760
Don't care.

2388
03:06:01,459 --> 03:06:07,010
A little vibe check.

2389
03:06:07,010 --> 03:06:07,510
Let's see.

2390
03:06:09,079 --> 03:06:10,600
In quick survival mode,

2391
03:06:10,600 --> 03:06:12,920
there's an unlimited number of walls.

2392
03:06:22,719 --> 03:06:25,440
It's time to face the horde.

2393
03:06:31,489 --> 03:06:32,930
Unlimited number of walls?

2394
03:06:33,569 --> 03:06:48,469
Oh, I've seen this already.

2395
03:06:49,190 --> 03:06:51,200
Congratulations.

2396
03:06:54,899 --> 03:06:58,049
God damn it.

2397
03:06:58,930 --> 03:07:07,510
Oh, it's gone.

2398
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:07,829
It's gone.

2399
03:07:07,829 --> 03:07:08,329
It's gone.

2400
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:23,590
More?

2401
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:35,260
Oh, I got it.

2402
03:07:35,260 --> 03:07:35,760
Oh, I got it.

2403
03:07:38,159 --> 03:07:39,440
How many of these do in a row?

2404
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:40,239
I've seen this already.

2405
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:50,719
Congratulations.

2406
03:07:50,719 --> 03:07:52,790
How many times do I have to take a shower?

2407
03:07:53,590 --> 03:08:03,809
It was not even close.

2408
03:08:12,129 --> 03:08:23,139
It's lagging.

2409
03:08:23,780 --> 03:08:45,809
Did it get harder?

2410
03:09:01,799 --> 03:09:02,840
Am I stuck here forever

2411
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:05,559
doing like the business man at the sidewalk?

2412
03:09:06,520 --> 03:09:10,159
How is he holding the briefcase?

2413
03:09:14,319 --> 03:09:23,270
All right.

2414
03:09:23,270 --> 03:09:23,829
Ten more of these

2415
03:09:23,829 --> 03:09:25,030
and if I don't see a new one, I'm stopping.

2416
03:09:38,850 --> 03:09:39,090
All right.

2417
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:39,569
I'm done.

2418
03:09:39,569 --> 03:09:39,969
I'm done.

2419
03:09:39,969 --> 03:09:40,610
I'm done.

2420
03:09:40,610 --> 03:09:42,850
I think I only have unlocked one set.

2421
03:09:43,489 --> 03:09:52,799
I'm trapped here.

2422
03:09:58,760 --> 03:09:59,260
I'm done.

2423
03:09:59,979 --> 03:10:00,729
Get done.

2424
03:10:00,729 --> 03:10:01,290
I'm done.

2425
03:10:01,290 --> 03:10:02,409
Play until it crashes.

2426
03:10:03,209 --> 03:10:07,280
I lost.

2427
03:10:07,819 --> 03:10:16,469
I'm gonna wake up.

2428
03:10:17,030 --> 03:10:30,729
We got no pictures either.

2429
03:10:30,729 --> 03:10:31,229
All right.

2430
03:10:31,690 --> 03:10:36,569
Time to bring out.

2431
03:10:36,569 --> 03:10:38,329
Time to bring out the big guns.

2432
03:10:39,209 --> 03:10:45,100
Time to play You're in the Movies.

2433
03:10:45,100 --> 03:10:46,459
I'm gonna do like a few movies.

2434
03:10:50,059 --> 03:10:50,860
Where'd it go?

2435
03:10:51,500 --> 03:10:59,879
Time for You're in the Movies.

2436
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:07,110
Actually, let me get some water.

2437
03:11:07,110 --> 03:11:08,389
We'll take one last break.

2438
03:11:08,389 --> 03:11:08,790
Oh, sorry.

2439
03:11:08,790 --> 03:11:10,149
I'm like bumping you.

2440
03:11:10,149 --> 03:11:11,049
I'm gonna be right back.

2441
03:11:11,049 --> 03:11:12,649
Get some water and we'll do You're in the Movies.

2442
03:14:36,520 --> 03:14:37,799
Ladies and gentlemen,

2443
03:14:37,799 --> 03:14:40,090
I might have to tell you a disappointment

2444
03:14:40,090 --> 03:14:41,290
Andy might be coming up here.

2445
03:14:42,170 --> 03:14:43,930
I'd have to postpone this.

2446
03:14:45,139 --> 03:14:45,940
You're in the Movies.

2447
03:14:46,579 --> 03:14:48,469
I completely forgot.

2448
03:14:48,469 --> 03:14:49,430
You're in the Movies.

2449
03:14:49,430 --> 03:14:52,229
I had a green screen behind me last time.

2450
03:14:52,229 --> 03:14:52,729
Remember?

2451
03:14:53,270 --> 03:14:55,500
I'm not sure we're gonna get a good picture here.

2452
03:14:57,270 --> 03:15:01,399
I might need a green screen and some lights.

2453
03:15:01,399 --> 03:15:02,120
Yeah, that's...

2454
03:15:02,840 --> 03:15:03,239
That's...

2455
03:15:03,239 --> 03:15:03,959
We'll see.

2456
03:15:03,959 --> 03:15:05,559
We'll see if it looks all right.

2457
03:15:05,559 --> 03:15:11,059
Don't need that.

2458
03:15:11,059 --> 03:15:12,739
Oh, just...

2459
03:15:12,739 --> 03:15:14,180
We might.

2460
03:15:17,479 --> 03:15:18,840
I might not even show up.

2461
03:15:19,399 --> 03:15:34,149
So let's find out.

2462
03:15:34,149 --> 03:15:35,909
Normal people don't have green screens, though.

2463
03:15:37,450 --> 03:15:38,170
I mean, do...

2464
03:15:38,170 --> 03:15:38,409
I mean...

2465
03:15:40,540 --> 03:15:43,420
Do you want it to look good or do you want it to just exist?

2466
03:15:43,420 --> 03:15:45,079
You know what I'm saying?

2467
03:15:45,079 --> 03:15:45,399
It might...

2468
03:15:45,399 --> 03:15:46,360
It might be very bad.

2469
03:15:46,360 --> 03:15:47,319
We'll find out.

2470
03:15:47,319 --> 03:15:52,409
Normal people don't have Kinects either.

2471
03:15:56,680 --> 03:15:58,280
We just want it to exist.

2472
03:16:05,319 --> 03:16:05,879
All right.

2473
03:16:05,879 --> 03:16:06,520
Let's see what happens.

2474
03:16:10,920 --> 03:16:11,239
All right.

2475
03:16:11,239 --> 03:16:11,879
I don't know.

2476
03:16:11,879 --> 03:16:14,280
That sequel is never as good as the original.

2477
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:15,239
I don't know if I like that.

2478
03:16:15,239 --> 03:16:16,120
I don't know if I want to do that.

2479
03:16:16,920 --> 03:16:20,940
How do I do this?

2480
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:34,010
Hey.

2481
03:16:34,010 --> 03:16:34,170
No.

2482
03:16:42,020 --> 03:16:43,780
I fucking hate headphones so much.

2483
03:16:45,139 --> 03:16:47,860
When can I get the chip implanted in here so I can just go...

2484
03:16:47,860 --> 03:16:48,979
And there's audio.

2485
03:16:48,979 --> 03:16:49,860
I hate this shit.

2486
03:16:49,860 --> 03:16:53,620
I feel like I'm going on a goddamn scuba dive expedition when I put earphones in.

2487
03:16:54,579 --> 03:16:54,739
Like...

2488
03:16:59,860 --> 03:17:01,219
I fucking hate headphones so much.

2489
03:17:02,739 --> 03:17:14,739
It's not a Kinect game.

2490
03:17:27,850 --> 03:17:28,729
Come on.

2491
03:17:28,729 --> 03:17:35,930
Where is it?

2492
03:17:36,819 --> 03:17:39,139
Where's my Xbox vision camera?

2493
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:56,489
Oh, no.

2494
03:17:57,290 --> 03:18:15,459
Oh, no.

2495
03:18:16,180 --> 03:18:19,540
No!

2496
03:18:19,540 --> 03:18:21,379
Where's my Xbox vision camera?

2497
03:18:37,110 --> 03:18:39,670
I know myself so well.

2498
03:18:40,309 --> 03:18:42,389
I know myself so well.

2499
03:18:43,479 --> 03:18:45,319
Do you know how well I know myself?

2500
03:18:45,879 --> 03:18:48,680
Would you like to know how well I know myself?

2501
03:18:48,680 --> 03:18:49,799
Let me go ahead and show you.

2502
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:52,280
Xbox live vision camera.

2503
03:18:52,280 --> 03:18:54,120
I streamed this like two fucking years ago.

2504
03:18:54,440 --> 03:18:55,879
Like a year and a half ago at least, right?

2505
03:18:56,899 --> 03:18:59,940
I had the Xbox live vision camera.

2506
03:18:59,940 --> 03:19:01,139
Now, you need that peripheral.

2507
03:19:01,139 --> 03:19:03,479
It's an old shit peripheral.

2508
03:19:03,479 --> 03:19:10,120
And I somehow, in my drunken ADHD, I was like, you know what I have to fucking do?

2509
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:11,319
You know what I have to fucking do?

2510
03:19:11,959 --> 03:19:16,840
I have to make sure that I buy two of these because I'm going to lose one.

2511
03:19:26,010 --> 03:19:29,850
I've got a sealed-in-the-box Xbox live vision camera.

2512
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:33,079
Because I was like, you know what?

2513
03:19:33,079 --> 03:19:35,079
Might as well just get two because I'm a fucking idiot.

2514
03:19:40,299 --> 03:19:40,780
Sell it?

2515
03:19:42,920 --> 03:19:43,559
What?

2516
03:19:43,559 --> 03:19:48,069
I've had this in a box in my closet for two years.

2517
03:19:48,709 --> 03:19:52,379
Can I even do this right now?

2518
03:19:55,829 --> 03:19:56,469
All right.

2519
03:19:56,469 --> 03:20:01,239
But should I try to find the first?

2520
03:20:01,239 --> 03:20:08,059
Wait, should I try to open this first or actually sell it?

2521
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:18,620
Fuck.

2522
03:20:18,620 --> 03:20:21,829
It's an easy $12.

2523
03:20:21,829 --> 03:20:22,149
No, no, no.

2524
03:20:22,149 --> 03:20:23,510
This is not $12, dude.

2525
03:20:23,510 --> 03:20:23,989
Oh my god.

2526
03:20:23,989 --> 03:20:24,469
I just punched you.

2527
03:20:24,469 --> 03:20:24,950
I'm so sorry.

2528
03:20:25,909 --> 03:20:26,629
They're not expensive?

2529
03:20:26,629 --> 03:20:27,590
Yes, they are.

2530
03:20:27,590 --> 03:20:31,620
You know how much an Xbox live vision camera sealed is?

2531
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:33,860
Xbox live vision camera.

2532
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:37,059
This shit is expensive.

2533
03:20:38,579 --> 03:20:44,100
It is.

2534
03:20:44,100 --> 03:20:46,260
I think this stuff, I think this is like $150.

2535
03:20:50,840 --> 03:20:53,159
Dude, it's $50 and it's only, it's only $8.

2536
03:21:04,620 --> 03:21:06,459
It's in the, I'm going to get a pair of scissors.

2537
03:21:08,680 --> 03:21:10,360
I'm going to get hurt trying to open this.

2538
03:21:10,360 --> 03:21:13,079
It's the old clamshell, like, get stabbed packaging.

2539
03:21:18,250 --> 03:21:18,649
Ow.

2540
03:21:21,909 --> 03:21:22,469
Hold on.

2541
03:21:22,469 --> 03:21:44,059
Let me get a pair of, ow, ow, ouch, ow, ow.

2542
03:21:44,059 --> 03:21:44,780
Stop, what?

2543
03:21:50,520 --> 03:21:53,370
Ow.

2544
03:21:53,370 --> 03:21:54,329
Okay, let me show you this.

2545
03:21:54,889 --> 03:21:56,649
This is like fucking glass.

2546
03:21:56,649 --> 03:21:58,090
Like what, what were they thinking?

2547
03:21:58,729 --> 03:22:00,090
What were they actually thinking?

2548
03:22:00,809 --> 03:22:07,180
This is like, this is fucking glass.

2549
03:22:07,819 --> 03:22:11,129
Look at this, it's glass.

2550
03:22:11,930 --> 03:22:18,170
This is like, you're going to get like, I can't.

2551
03:22:18,170 --> 03:22:19,290
I thought this was a fucking Kinect game.

2552
03:22:19,290 --> 03:22:19,770
Give me a minute.

2553
03:22:20,409 --> 03:23:54,420
Dude, I'm telling you right now.

2554
03:23:55,540 --> 03:23:56,979
How did this last for this long?

2555
03:23:57,860 --> 03:23:58,420
You know what I mean?

2556
03:24:01,139 --> 03:24:04,739
How the fuck did this last this long for this shit to be like this?

2557
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:08,569
Like, if I'm a congress member or something,

2558
03:24:09,209 --> 03:24:11,129
the first time I open a package like this,

2559
03:24:11,129 --> 03:24:14,010
the next day I'm being like, this shit's fucking illegal now.

2560
03:24:21,049 --> 03:24:23,850
This clamshell package, this is fucking insane.

2561
03:24:25,049 --> 03:24:27,290
Like, what the fuck were they thinking?

2562
03:24:28,329 --> 03:24:31,270
They're out of their minds.

2563
03:24:34,180 --> 03:24:35,219
And I've got tools here.

2564
03:24:35,219 --> 03:24:36,819
I've got like a fucking tool here.

2565
03:24:37,620 --> 03:24:51,739
I would have, I would have put a bill on the table.

2566
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:56,459
That was, you put something in clamshell packaging.

2567
03:24:57,100 --> 03:25:01,059
The company has fined 500 fucking quadrillion dollars.

2568
03:25:01,780 --> 03:25:03,290
Ain't ever going to do it again.

2569
03:25:06,090 --> 03:25:06,969
Ah, that could have hurt me.

2570
03:25:07,610 --> 03:25:12,180
All right, I'm in.

2571
03:25:20,260 --> 03:25:21,139
Merry Christmas!

2572
03:25:21,940 --> 03:25:34,629
Why's there a headset?

2573
03:25:34,629 --> 03:25:37,739
Why's there a headset in here?

2574
03:25:37,739 --> 03:25:51,379
Put it on.

2575
03:25:52,020 --> 03:25:52,579
Let's start.

2576
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:55,299
I have to plug in the camera for this.

2577
03:25:55,299 --> 03:25:57,940
Wait, oh no, this ain't going to fucking work.

2578
03:25:57,940 --> 03:26:00,579
Because I need to like, this, look at this little stand.

2579
03:26:00,579 --> 03:26:01,940
This ain't going to fit anywhere.

2580
03:26:03,059 --> 03:26:04,260
This is, this ain't going to happen.

2581
03:26:05,219 --> 03:26:08,649
I don't, I, wait, can I put, I think I can put it on top of the Kinect.

2582
03:26:09,370 --> 03:26:14,069
Let me see if I can get it on top of the Kinect.

2583
03:26:14,069 --> 03:26:19,059
It's the last time I actually taped it to the top of my monitor.

2584
03:26:19,059 --> 03:26:21,139
See if I can get it to stand on the Kinect.

2585
03:26:43,930 --> 03:26:44,329
We're good.

2586
03:26:45,129 --> 03:26:45,770
We're good, it's on.

2587
03:26:46,409 --> 03:26:46,889
Plug it in.

2588
03:26:47,450 --> 03:26:50,659
All right, hold on, the VRB.

2589
03:26:51,379 --> 03:26:55,030
It's peering on top of there.

2590
03:26:55,590 --> 03:27:15,340
Work!

2591
03:27:15,340 --> 03:27:26,680
Looks like it's on.

2592
03:27:26,680 --> 03:27:37,860
Holy shit, this looks horrible.

2593
03:27:54,860 --> 03:28:06,649
It's like, yeah, it's like 10p.

2594
03:28:06,649 --> 03:28:07,290
Wipe it off?

2595
03:28:08,170 --> 03:28:11,049
Is it dead pixels on this thing?

2596
03:28:11,770 --> 03:28:21,750
They're dead pixels.

2597
03:28:21,750 --> 03:28:22,790
All right, hold on.

2598
03:28:22,790 --> 03:28:23,510
Movie theater.

2599
03:28:24,229 --> 03:28:24,870
Make a movie.

2600
03:28:31,959 --> 03:28:32,520
Oh no!

2601
03:28:37,639 --> 03:28:39,239
Fuck, did the save?

2602
03:28:39,239 --> 03:28:40,520
No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

2603
03:28:41,319 --> 03:28:42,040
I'm on David.

2604
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:43,770
I'm on David.

2605
03:28:47,129 --> 03:28:48,170
No, it's not in focus.

2606
03:28:56,600 --> 03:29:12,340
There's a dead pixel.

2607
03:29:12,340 --> 03:29:13,700
There's like five dead pixels.

2608
03:29:25,780 --> 03:29:26,020
Yes!

2609
03:29:55,450 --> 03:30:01,209
Need a green screen!

2610
03:30:09,850 --> 03:30:11,930
Are you sure you want it to exist?

2611
03:30:13,049 --> 03:30:14,250
You positive?

2612
03:30:14,250 --> 03:30:15,370
You can't even see me.

2613
03:30:23,479 --> 03:30:25,479
No, no, it's got to be better than that.

2614
03:30:25,479 --> 03:30:26,360
It's got to be better.

2615
03:30:26,360 --> 03:30:27,559
I'm candidate.

2616
03:30:28,120 --> 03:30:28,760
I'm candidate.

2617
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:30,040
We're going to do this again another day.

2618
03:30:31,799 --> 03:30:32,680
Take your shirt off.

2619
03:30:33,159 --> 03:30:34,280
That actually probably would help.

2620
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:36,329
What did?

2621
03:30:36,889 --> 03:30:40,950
Oh, what am I doing?

2622
03:30:40,950 --> 03:30:42,069
What the fuck am I doing?

2623
03:30:42,069 --> 03:30:44,489
Your audio?

2624
03:30:50,180 --> 03:30:51,459
It's like eating my whole face.

2625
03:31:00,010 --> 03:31:01,049
No, this ain't going to work.

2626
03:31:01,610 --> 03:31:03,319
It ain't going to work.

2627
03:31:03,319 --> 03:31:05,159
I'm going to set this up so we can do it for real.

2628
03:31:14,600 --> 03:31:16,120
It does work.

2629
03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:18,920
Holy shit, there's a line.

2630
03:31:18,920 --> 03:31:19,799
Put a blanket up.

2631
03:31:21,270 --> 03:31:23,270
I put a blanket up?

2632
03:31:23,270 --> 03:31:25,190
It's going to take like fucking 30 minutes

2633
03:31:25,190 --> 03:31:26,549
for me to get a blanket and put it up.

2634
03:31:26,549 --> 03:31:28,069
I don't have a blanket that can go up there.

2635
03:31:28,870 --> 03:31:30,840
Press RB.

2636
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:32,360
I've been going to different color styles.

2637
03:31:34,200 --> 03:31:35,479
I'm going to call it here.

2638
03:31:35,479 --> 03:31:36,440
I want to get this ready.

2639
03:31:37,239 --> 03:31:44,860
That just made me depressed.

2640
03:31:45,420 --> 03:32:00,569
I'm looking.

2641
03:32:00,569 --> 03:32:02,010
I thought this was a Kinect game.

2642
03:32:04,340 --> 03:32:04,659
Well, wait.

2643
03:32:04,659 --> 03:32:04,979
Hold on.

2644
03:32:04,979 --> 03:32:05,540
Hold on a minute.

2645
03:32:06,260 --> 03:32:09,819
Oh, this one sucks.

2646
03:32:10,459 --> 03:32:14,649
You see yourself clearly in the background.

2647
03:32:14,649 --> 03:32:14,889
No.

2648
03:32:54,260 --> 03:32:55,059
Better shirt on?

2649
03:32:55,059 --> 03:32:55,459
Hold on.

2650
03:32:56,100 --> 03:33:49,079
Oh, son.

2651
03:33:49,319 --> 03:33:50,680
You forgot to turn your screen off.

2652
03:33:53,819 --> 03:33:55,739
You got to turn off this fucking Xbox again.

2653
03:33:56,379 --> 03:34:00,860
It's the shelf.

2654
03:34:01,819 --> 03:34:03,420
It's not going to be possible to have a screen.

2655
03:34:06,780 --> 03:34:07,100
All right.

2656
03:34:13,159 --> 03:34:13,879
Move the shelf.

2657
03:34:14,440 --> 03:34:14,840
Camera.

2658
03:34:14,840 --> 03:34:16,680
I got very much room.

2659
03:34:16,680 --> 03:34:17,399
Remove the shelf.

2660
03:34:17,399 --> 03:34:18,760
I can't just move a shelf.

2661
03:34:18,760 --> 03:34:20,680
There's a shitload of stuff on here.

2662
03:34:20,680 --> 03:34:21,559
I'll knock it over.

2663
03:34:24,040 --> 03:34:24,360
All right.

2664
03:34:25,239 --> 03:34:26,040
I'm going to res...

2665
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:26,360
All right.

2666
03:34:26,360 --> 03:34:26,760
That's it.

2667
03:34:26,760 --> 03:34:27,559
I'll see you guys later.

2668
03:34:28,360 --> 03:34:29,239
I'll see you guys later.

2669
03:34:29,239 --> 03:34:29,639
We tried.

2670
03:34:37,239 --> 03:34:39,020
But very important.

2671
03:34:51,739 --> 03:34:52,459
God damn it.

2672
03:34:52,459 --> 03:34:53,899
It's close, but it's not going to work.

2673
03:35:01,770 --> 03:35:14,149
All right.

2674
03:35:14,950 --> 03:35:15,590
I'll see you guys later.

2675
03:35:15,590 --> 03:35:15,909
I'm done.

2676
03:35:18,340 --> 03:35:18,979
That was fun.

2677
03:35:20,500 --> 03:35:21,139
It's fun.

2678
03:35:28,629 --> 03:35:31,909
I fucking drained all my batteries doing the UFC fight thing.

2679
03:35:32,549 --> 03:35:35,340
I'll be live tomorrow.

2680
03:35:35,340 --> 03:35:36,059
We'll do it tomorrow.

2681
03:35:36,780 --> 03:35:39,020
Let me try to get it actually set up so we can do it tomorrow.

2682
03:35:46,819 --> 03:35:47,780
Family Guy music.

2683
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:49,239
All right.

2684
03:35:49,239 --> 03:35:51,399
So I'm going to try to get this set up for tomorrow.

2685
03:35:51,399 --> 03:35:56,780
If I don't like the way it looks, just keep an eye on the sus.

2686
03:35:57,340 --> 03:35:59,260
Because if I can't get this the way that I want it,

2687
03:35:59,260 --> 03:36:01,260
then we'll do it again later with a proper screen.

2688
03:36:03,799 --> 03:36:06,520
If not, then I'll be back in a couple of days.

2689
03:36:06,520 --> 03:36:06,840
Okay.

2690
03:36:07,399 --> 03:36:07,959
I'm going to try.

2691
03:36:08,680 --> 03:36:10,459
Keep an eye on the sus.

2692
03:36:10,459 --> 03:36:11,420
It's to be determined.

2693
03:36:11,420 --> 03:36:12,059
I'm going to...

2694
03:36:12,059 --> 03:36:13,100
Tomorrow I'm going to get up early.

2695
03:36:13,739 --> 03:36:15,110
Maybe I can get this to work.

2696
03:36:15,750 --> 03:36:18,950
That was a lot of fun though.

2697
03:36:18,950 --> 03:36:21,770
It sucks.

2698
03:36:21,770 --> 03:36:22,969
What a fucking waste of...

2699
03:36:23,530 --> 03:36:24,969
What a waste of waxling.

2700
03:36:25,610 --> 03:36:25,850
No.

2701
03:36:25,850 --> 03:36:26,649
Should I be that harsh?

2702
03:36:27,290 --> 03:36:31,319
I don't know if I should be that harsh.

2703
03:36:32,040 --> 03:36:40,569
And I fucking sucked laughing my ass off.

2704
03:36:41,370 --> 03:36:42,299
Yeah.

2705
03:36:42,299 --> 03:36:42,540
All right.

2706
03:36:42,540 --> 03:36:44,860
If it's not this tomorrow, then I will see you on.

2707
03:36:45,739 --> 03:36:47,260
And I'll be very...

2708
03:36:47,260 --> 03:36:48,860
You'll just keep an eye on the sus.

2709
03:36:48,860 --> 03:36:56,489
If there's no stream tomorrow, then we will be live on the...

2710
03:36:57,290 --> 03:36:59,370
All right.

2711
03:36:59,370 --> 03:37:00,170
The sixth...

2712
03:37:00,170 --> 03:37:01,370
I got to plan this out here because it's...

2713
03:37:03,659 --> 03:37:07,739
The next stream is actually to be determined because the sixth is a big stream.

2714
03:37:08,889 --> 03:37:10,409
And I got to make sure that's ready to go.

2715
03:37:10,409 --> 03:37:11,129
So let's...

2716
03:37:12,010 --> 03:37:13,610
There'll be another stream in the next few days.

2717
03:37:15,239 --> 03:37:18,600
If you don't know, there's going to be a major stream on the sixth.

2718
03:37:19,399 --> 03:37:20,700
You'll see what it is.

2719
03:37:21,690 --> 03:37:22,889
Wonders of Archaeology.

2720
03:37:25,350 --> 03:37:26,389
I just need to figure out...

2721
03:37:27,110 --> 03:37:31,030
Because there's production shit that's going to be happening over the next four or five days.

2722
03:37:31,750 --> 03:37:33,670
And I kind of need to know exactly what's going on.

2723
03:37:33,670 --> 03:37:35,430
So you'll see that.

2724
03:37:35,430 --> 03:37:37,670
I will just keep an eye on the sus over the next day or two.

2725
03:37:37,670 --> 03:37:39,590
I don't really know exactly when the next stream will be,

2726
03:37:39,590 --> 03:37:41,030
but it will be within the next few days.

2727
03:37:43,239 --> 03:37:44,200
To be determined.

2728
03:37:46,579 --> 03:37:48,500
I will see you guys to be determined.

2729
03:37:49,219 --> 03:37:53,500
Have a great rest of your night.

2730
03:37:53,500 --> 03:37:56,600
I got to turn off this Family Guy music.

2731
03:37:56,600 --> 03:37:58,600
We'll see you guys within the next few days.

2732
03:37:58,600 --> 03:37:59,479
I'll see you soon.

2733
03:37:59,479 --> 03:38:04,440
I just want to make sure I get this right.

2734
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:06,280
That same monkey eating the bananas.

2735
03:38:11,370 --> 03:38:12,809
Thanks, as always, for watching, everybody.

2736
03:38:13,530 --> 03:38:16,409
I'm going to go take a shower or a bath or either or.

2737
03:38:16,409 --> 03:38:21,379
And I think the Kinect is going to get punted as far as I can get it.

2738
03:38:21,940 --> 03:38:25,100
We're stream heart.

2739
03:38:25,100 --> 03:38:26,540
I don't believe that's accurate.

2740
03:38:28,870 --> 03:38:29,989
I don't think that's accurate.

2741
03:38:29,989 --> 03:38:30,309
I don't.

2742
03:38:30,309 --> 03:38:32,010
I don't think that's accurate.

2743
03:38:32,010 --> 03:38:33,370
I had a lot of fun on this stream.

2744
03:38:33,370 --> 03:38:34,090
Usually I can tell.

2745
03:38:45,940 --> 03:38:46,819
And that guy.

2746
03:38:46,819 --> 03:38:47,379
No, you can't.

2747
03:38:47,379 --> 03:38:51,059
You're not going to get banned if having an opinion on whether a stream was good or not.

2748
03:38:51,059 --> 03:38:53,959
I mean, I'll call you a fucking dick.

2749
03:38:53,959 --> 03:39:03,739
You're not going to get banned.

2750
03:39:03,739 --> 03:39:04,299
All right.

2751
03:39:04,299 --> 03:39:06,700
Let us hold on a second here.

2752
03:39:06,700 --> 03:39:20,120
You're right.

2753
03:39:20,120 --> 03:39:24,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, yes, yes.

2754
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:33,799
Styr is RPing right now.

2755
03:39:33,799 --> 03:39:34,680
Oh, my God.

2756
03:39:34,680 --> 03:39:37,299
Are you serious?

2757
03:39:37,299 --> 03:39:37,540
All right.

2758
03:39:37,540 --> 03:39:38,659
I'm going to let's write Styr.

2759
03:39:39,799 --> 03:39:43,639
I'm very curious because I let's see how how GTA RP is.

2760
03:39:45,020 --> 03:39:45,579
All right.

2761
03:39:45,579 --> 03:39:47,020
Styr is RPing right now.

2762
03:39:47,020 --> 03:39:50,379
OK, so like he's not going to sing you a raid song.

2763
03:39:50,379 --> 03:39:53,459
He's like in the middle of RPing.

2764
03:39:53,459 --> 03:40:01,719
So let him RP if he's in the middle of like a routine or something.

2765
03:40:01,719 --> 03:40:02,920
I just it's all good.

2766
03:40:02,920 --> 03:40:08,420
You see, let's see how he does be nice.

2767
03:40:08,420 --> 03:40:10,659
I will see you guys in the next few days.

2768
03:40:11,379 --> 03:40:13,879
Take care of yourselves.

2769
03:40:13,879 --> 03:42:46,860
See you soon and good night.
