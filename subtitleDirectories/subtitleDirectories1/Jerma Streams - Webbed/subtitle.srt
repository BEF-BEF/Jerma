1
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:24,120
Hey, I thought you were retiring. Not right now. Late. Hey! He's gonna delay his retirement.

2
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:33,820
What are you, what are you, why are you saying that? What's going on? Yeah, I am very early.

3
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:45,289
I'm so early, in fact, that I am almost a full day early. I'm one day early. We've got some good news

4
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:53,270
for all of you, uh, audio Andes that hate everything about my mic setup and my audio setup.

5
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:06,680
Good news for you. My entire audio setup is changing as of after this stream. I'm gonna have

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:17,879
hopefully a really, really crystal clean sound as of next stream. Maybe. Depends on when I want to

7
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:34,359
get some of this stuff. I mean, speaking of mics, hold on. I said you already have a Newman. What

8
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:44,700
could you improve? Um, I like, okay, I like the go XLR, but I don't, I don't know, I don't like

9
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:53,349
the way that it makes my mic sound. I've tried so many settings with this thing. The product is,

10
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:59,849
it's an all encompassing product, right? You plug in an XLR mic, you have complete control,

11
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:07,299
you can do funny sound effects, you can do voice changing. It's very easy to use software. But every

12
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,310
time I change a setting on it, I feel like it makes it sound worse. I'm going to try a few things.

13
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:30,659
I'm going to try this mic with a new compressor, see how that sounds. I'm going to try maybe a

14
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,099
different mic setup, a different way, a different positioning of the mic, a different boom arm.

15
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:42,939
I'm going to try a few things, but how are you going to do funny voice effects? I don't worry.

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,919
I might still use the go XLR. I might actually still plug it in and use it.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:56,330
Please address this title. It sucks. Just being a bug. I'm just being a bug. I'm early being a bug.

18
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:04,900
Spiders aren't bugs, you nerd. Yes, they are. A spider is a bug. It's a bug. What do you want to

19
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:14,840
say? It's a, it's not a bug. A spider is a bug. Yes, it is. I'm a bug is a bug. I know it's a

20
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,840
crustacean. It's a, it's a crab was a small crab with extra legs. Whatever. It's a bug. It's the

21
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,360
thing that crawls on your wall and it bites you and it has got poison in it and it will poison

22
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:36,810
you if it fucking touches you. Some of them. Spiders are bugs, but they're not insects. Yeah,

23
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:48,580
thank you. Appreciate that. Hurry up and play this stupid game. I can only watch for 15 minutes.

24
00:03:49,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Dude, the game is only four hours long and you should know this by now. The first 15 minutes

25
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,069
of every one of my streams are awful. It's me explaining to you a dream I had or how much

26
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,729
Dunkin Donuts went downhill or how I forgot to drink water and I'll be right back again.

27
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,170
Now for the first, the first 15 minutes is a warm up, man. Let's be like that every time.

28
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:26,459
You said Thursday. I know. Yeah, I'm full of surprises. I did say Thursday, although the

29
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:33,529
reason why I'm here now and starting very late is because I have to take Otto to the vet. He's um,

30
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:48,019
some things I want to get checked out. He's okay. I think he's fine. Is he okay? I think he's going

31
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:56,389
to be 100% fine. He just might. He's having the same kind of, I don't know, he's, he's peeing a

32
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,970
lot. I think he's been prone to getting UTIs. He's had it a couple times. He's had a UTI a couple

33
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:12,949
times over the last five to 10 years. I feel like this is starting a new one. So I'm just going to

34
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:23,509
go get it checked out, see if he's okay. He actually had blood work done a couple months ago,

35
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,389
less than a month, like a month ago and it was fine. He was, it was all normal.

36
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:33,370
So I wonder if this is something just brand new, but we'll see. He's fine. He's happy. He's just,

37
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:37,370
it needs to be addressed, needs to be looked into. So I decided, you know what,

38
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:44,470
if I'm going to take him probably tomorrow, then I going to stream today. So I'm going to be taking

39
00:05:44,470 --> 00:06:00,810
him to the vet tomorrow. You're a good dog, dad. I, he's, he's like the best. Everybody, everybody's

40
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:10,889
a good dog, dad. Okay. There are personal, there are like personal best friends. That's how I see

41
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,089
Otto. Otto's just like a, he's just, he's just best friend. It's just that, there you go. There's

42
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:22,899
my, there's what he is. True. Yeah. Everybody's dog is their best friend. And I don't believe

43
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:34,920
anybody that says otherwise. Does it in the goddamn title. But you can have human best friends and

44
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:51,370
dog best friends. Otto is my BFF. But yeah, I, there's two things for you to know. Next stream,

45
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,709
I'm going to sound completely different. I am going to be doing some audio testing for the next

46
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:02,699
few streams. We'll find a good place where I sound good. I might even use the same setup. I'm just

47
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:10,579
going to change a bunch of settings, but I'm getting some new equipment. Jeremy, you're

48
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:16,500
fucked in the head. Not going to lie. That talked about my dog being my like BFF.

49
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,029
I don't think anything I said was too outrageous right there. I feel like everything I just said

50
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,620
was very, very plain, normal, and, and very expected. That wasn't too crazy, right? I don't

51
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,160
think so. All right. So here's what we're doing. I was going to play house flipper pets DLC, which

52
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:50,199
I mean, we're talking about dogs, you know, cats and gerbils and rabbits and bugs. If you have them

53
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,680
but that's not what we're doing today because I'm starting so late. This is an impromptu early

54
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,750
reverse delay stream. We're going to play webbed, which we were just talking about bugs. So webbed

55
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,500
is a game where you play as a spider and spider around. And that's what we're going to do. So

56
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,740
nothing tomorrow. As I take auto to the vet for the impromptu schedule change, but here we are,

57
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:30,069
we're just going to spider around. So the plan, the game plan is there is as follows. Are you

58
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:43,259
listening? Listen up. This is a listen up engine house flipper pets. DLC is going to be Saturday

59
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:49,340
and Sunday because during that same period we're going to play wad blood wash and murder house.

60
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,399
So this weekend we're going to do pets, DLC, murder house and blood wash. I'm not sure which

61
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:08,360
day they could flip back and forth. It's the plan going forward here. Oh brother, this guy stinks.

62
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:18,980
What was that? If you had a movie made about you, who would play you?

63
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:36,950
Me. Is that really a question? Me. I would play me. But did you mean, because I'm 36,

64
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,830
what, what time period does this movie take place? When I'm older, when I'm still young,

65
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:49,940
younger, what, what is this movie about? Cause everyone's saying, oh, what it would be Willem

66
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,710
Defoe. But Willem Defoe is a lot older than me. Five years from now in the future. Um,

67
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:11,419
can it be Steve Buscemi? I can see it. I am still young. I'm young. I'm still, I'm still young.

68
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:20,379
I mean, when I turned, I think when I turned 38 is when I'm just going to be able to say, I can't,

69
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:28,419
I'm not young anymore. Although I did fall out of the 18 to 34 bracket, drop down bracket for how

70
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:42,019
old you are. That's true. Old is 46. I think old is 40. Old is definitely 40. It's 40. You can't

71
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:48,019
say you're, I'm young. Oh yeah. I'm just a young guy when you're 40. That doesn't, no, you're 40.

72
00:10:50,139 --> 00:11:00,019
I think 30. Uh, I think 40 is the new 30 though. People are living a lot longer. So I look, I mean,

73
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:15,690
people are living to be like in their nineties. Aren't you 46? I'm 36. Aren't you 40? Um, no,

74
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:32,009
I'm, I'm almost 40 is midlife crisis, midlife. No, it's not. Is it? Yeah, it is. But okay. But

75
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,409
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You guys can't tell me that I, if I, when I turned 40,

76
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:41,450
you guys can't tell me I'm having a midlife crisis. If I act like a weirdo or if I do something

77
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,299
strange, I've been having, I've been doing that old kind of strange shit since I was

78
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:53,620
working in my twenties. Right. But you guys can't say, Oh dude, look at him. He's being so weird.

79
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,299
He's having a, he's having a midlife crisis. I did that stuff like 10 years ago too. Right.

80
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:04,919
I'm just, that's just who I am at this point. But don't say that. We make me feel incredibly

81
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:16,440
poorly. 36 plus 36 is 72. Yeah. And people are living to be a hundred. People are living

82
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:32,580
to be a hundred. 50 is midlife crisis. All right. You guys ready to play? Let's, let's play. This

83
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:42,009
is webbed. The game is called webbed. It looks great. It looks pretty cute. Is this a controller

84
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:47,179
game or should I play with my hands? Is this a hands game or is it, well, you don't have any

85
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:53,019
mouse. Should I play with my hand or should I use my thumbs? That's what I'm trying to say.

86
00:12:53,019 --> 00:13:07,110
Hands or thumbs? I think this is a hands game because you have to aim. That's a kind of scary

87
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:15,049
sound. It reminds me of, okay, you know when a hummingbird flies next to your head and you

88
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:22,840
feel like it's a gigantic, huge, scary insect and you go, Oh, you freak out, you scream and you've

89
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,669
run and you kind of move your hands around. And then afterwards you realize that you were blessed

90
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:37,139
by a hummingbird and you go, Oh no, come back. I'll stand still. Like, no, it's already gone, man.

91
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:51,220
You fucked it up. This is what you want. Want this? That doesn't happen. This does. Base cam Andy.

92
00:13:51,860 --> 00:14:00,870
I want you to crank your compressor up as high as it will go and do one radio host joke next stream,

93
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:10,360
please. Maybe. You've changed. Yeah. I'm sure I have. You guys have, you guys have seen me go from

94
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,370
a guy in his early to mid twenties to a guy in his mid to late thirties. Of course, you've seen it

95
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,899
in real time. Some of you guys that have been here for 10 years, 12 years, you of course have

96
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:27,610
to change probably. Hopefully for the better. I hope for the better. I've changed physically.

97
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:34,169
I've changed probably a little bit mentally. What are you talking about? 12 years have gone by.

98
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:45,820
You're a young man. You've changed. You look chiseled. No, I don't. No, I really don't actually

99
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:55,509
today. I'm not even any. No, I do not. Chiseled. Are you guys? No, I don't. I'm looking at it.

100
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:02,779
I'm looking at it right now. I'm looking at the screen over here. No, I don't. I look kind of,

101
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:11,049
I look like clay. Can you chisel clay? I don't think so. Yeah, you can after you cook it.

102
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:24,419
That's not a zit. What is that? What is that? It's like a clump of hairs. What is this? What

103
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:33,429
is that? Did I not shave there somehow last time? What is that? I have no idea what that is.

104
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:44,840
Do you know what I'm talking about? You have dents. Yeah, I do have a couple. Yeah, I do have a

105
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:54,169
couple of head dents. I do have dents in my head. Whatever. When you get to be 30, you don't give

106
00:15:54,169 --> 00:16:04,220
shit about a head dents. Who cares? I don't care about a head dent. I'm too old. I, guys, I used

107
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:11,720
to 10 years ago, I'd be in the mirror and I'd, every, every, I would sit there for 10 straight

108
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:24,230
minutes and just be like, I don't, I don't fucking care anymore. Like I care, I care enough. I care

109
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,590
enough to, I don't want to look like shit every day, right? But I mean, I'm not sitting in the

110
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:37,450
mirror parting individual strands of hair. I mean, this is just what I look like. And then for 40,

111
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,309
I look pretty damn good for 40. I'm sorry. You have to give yourself a little bit of credit

112
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:48,889
sometimes. I look pretty fucking good for 40. I think I've been drinking a lot of green tea.

113
00:16:48,889 --> 00:17:06,059
I've been drinking a lot of, excuse me, water. No tea today because I ran out. I drink it so much

114
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:19,779
that there's no more. I didn't get any more. Play the game. I'm just, it's been 10 minutes, man.

115
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:29,380
Stalling. I'm, yeah, I'm just, I'm just hanging out. You guys can chill. Just chill for a second.

116
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,730
How did you run out of tea? Because I drink, I drink so much of it. I've been drinking,

117
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,630
I've been trying a bunch of things. Got a few that I really like. I have these like green tea,

118
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,049
like energy packets. I've got green tea powder. I've got, dude, I'm going to have green tea

119
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:56,220
souvenir merchandise and shit eventually. And then I take care of my skin too. Moisturize.

120
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,420
Developers like to acknowledge the Shigera, Turbul, and Gooby Gooby peoples as the traditional

121
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:14,759
owners of the lands on which webs is based on. Holy shit. What the hell is that? That feels kind

122
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:35,210
of good to do that. Hold Q to dance. Okay. Space is jump. Hold that to grapple to a point. Oh shit.

123
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:54,339
Okay. That's kind of fun. Can I descend down? Okay. Let's keep going. Aim at a point and hold

124
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:03,259
right click to go to, to start spinning a web. Now aim at a second point and release to build a bridge.

125
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:25,529
Wait, what? Whoa. Okay. Oh, you can connect them. Spin. I can spin a web. All right. Why are you,

126
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,490
why is Jared Leto playing web? I don't look anything like Jared Leto, like at all.

127
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:39,670
It's zero. It is zero resemblance. Zero. If you put both of our faces in a scanning machine,

128
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,630
we would have a like fucking 12% compatibility. Okay. That's cool. I don't know what you're

129
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:53,380
talking about. What happened? Okay. So we got to go like this. Oh, this is mud. Can I not grab mud

130
00:19:54,339 --> 00:20:06,680
from here to here? Is this like Jump King? Am I going to get mad at this game? I'm probably,

131
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm going to be pissed this game, right? Is this game that's going to piss me off?

132
00:20:23,799 --> 00:21:04,410
12%. Holy shit. Shoot lasers? Okay. That's weird. Oh no. Why do I have lasers? What? Okay. Well,

133
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:12,099
that's kind of cool. I've Hey buddy. I'm so sorry. I saw it happen to your boyfriend.

134
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:19,779
That big mean bird has been menacing the land below its sky. Bower for years. It devoured

135
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,930
many of my siblings, but I think it has something else in mind for your bow. The bird loves to

136
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,569
collect blue gems, you see. And that love of yours is the shiniest blue I've ever seen.

137
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:42,299
Come by my old nest little buddy. I might have an idea. Okay. So this big ball of silk may not look

138
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:47,339
like much, but it was my home for a time. The ants below have approached me with reckless plans to

139
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,700
turn it into a heated airship. It's part of the defense effort. I've not let them try it so far,

140
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,259
but perhaps a little recklessness is what we need right now. Anybody else love ants because of the

141
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,460
Honey I Shrunk the Kids movie? People are like, oh, ants. Gross. Actually, I like ants.

142
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,650
In Honey I Shrunk the Kids, an ant saves all the kids. It defends them against a giant scorpion.

143
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:18,410
It's anti. They're good friends and it protects them. And I remember watching that and going,

144
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:25,160
ants are good. I like ants. They're good friends. I like ants because of that. Okay.

145
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,480
They'll need some fuel too, of course. I've looked to the dung beetles on the hill for that.

146
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:35,240
And naturally a guide is important for any adventure. Perhaps a bee. Nobody knows these

147
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,869
skies better than them. All right. Yes. This is a good plan. Go on little buddy. There's no time

148
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:55,819
to waste. Get out there, make some friends and save your love. Movement's clean. Is that fall

149
00:22:55,819 --> 00:23:07,400
damage? What's that? Can I grab that? What is it? I found, I got a little spider friend.

150
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:16,089
All right. Okay. I gotta go get to the, go to the ants. Oh, what happens if I get more? How many

151
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:33,720
of these should I get? Oh shit. Is there fall damage? All right. Okay. It reminds me of worms.

152
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:52,089
The ninja rope. Who's that? Oh, I'm giving up my, oh, these are babies. You don't weigh enough for

153
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:58,789
fall damage. New Spider-Man game looks pretty good. There's no fall damage. Okay. Thank you so

154
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,910
much. These little ones have ballooned off when that big bird flew by, but they're far too young

155
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,150
to be off on their own. If you find the others, please bring them back to me. I like birds.

156
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:18,869
I like crows. With 40, I could bring all 40. I like crows. You know that, did you guys know

157
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:32,099
that crows are the most intelligent fucking animal? Did you guys know that? Okay. I need to

158
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:44,069
find an ant. Can't get up there. Is this like a metroidvania? Do I have to go get like boots

159
00:24:44,069 --> 00:25:05,849
or something? I really do like the movement a lot though. It's fun. Where are these ants? Who asked,

160
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:14,549
nerd? Fuck. Who is that? Okay. There was a, okay. I gotta get over there. There's a fly over there.

161
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:39,579
I heckin' love small spiders. Stop. Whatever. Okay. I gotta get up here. So that fly is over

162
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:57,539
there. Can I like, like this? Oh shit. Okay. Oh. Ah, all right. That's how you, that's what I'm

163
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:26,009
supposed to do. No! What are you doing? Fuck. Okay. Get back up here. So if I go from here,

164
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:33,859
you should be right here. Oh, I got it. There we go. All right. What do you, what do you want?

165
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:41,700
Guild Predator, I am the Fly Lord. Your fangs are too small to devour me. If my kin don't sit well

166
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,950
in your stomach, come pay me a visit. Let's see what we can do about that. You haven't eaten even

167
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,390
a single fly? Perhaps I judged you too harshly. Get on your way, spider, and stay away from temptation.

168
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:18,339
Platformer Andy? What's up here? Oh. This is back where I was. This is where the,

169
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:28,420
all right. Get back over here. Tab for map? What the fuck? Okay. I'm in, I'm at the,

170
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,869
okay. I gotta go down there to go to the ant world. How do I get, how do I go there?

171
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:54,660
Where is it? Jumping spiders. I hecking love jumping spiders. Oh, here we go. All right. I got

172
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,500
it. Ant kingdom. Greetings, comrade spider. I hear you've got some problems that could use an ant

173
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,799
solution. We'd love to help out, but we're still recovering from the latest fire ant raid. The

174
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,599
workers could really use some extra help down there if you've got time. All right. Speak with comrade

175
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:32,869
Carl in the mech ant chamber. Be able to give you some work. Okay. Turn that on. What's this?

176
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:46,660
Can I dig? Hey, can spiders dig? Okay. What's the job? Help with the elevator. It's been broken

177
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,420
down since the attack, but I can't reach the part we need to fix it. If you can get me the brass

178
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,140
cog from the other side of this chamber, we should be able to get it running. Without that elevator,

179
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:05,049
we're stuck up here. All right. Fix the elevator. Fucking easy. All right. This is where you start

180
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:27,000
to die. Easy. Okay. I didn't know you could die in the game. What was that? Grubs? Oh,

181
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:49,140
I was supposed to do a huge cog. Hold on. Cog is right there. Oh, I actually have to drag it across.

182
00:29:49,140 --> 00:30:07,130
Oh, that sucks. All right. Hold on. Should I go down the secret? All right. Stay down there for a

183
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:14,569
minute. Should I go do the secret? What if I get stuck down here? Oh, it's just a grub. Okay. Cool.

184
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:33,619
I like this game. It's pretty cool. So far. So far. Hold on. Relax. So far. Can I go in the acid?

185
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:53,140
Yeah, I just can't. Oh, shit. Hold on. There you go. Thanks. I'll deliver the cog back to the main

186
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:10,460
shaft. Just pop it into the gearbox and we should be good. Do I have to do that? What? Do I have to

187
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,190
do anything? I demand to know what your favorite soup is. Ah, fucking cream of broccoli or something,

188
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:51,500
man. Like everybody else. Hold on. Did you go like this? Fuck you. There you go. He's going

189
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:03,819
to rage. I'm probably won't. This game's too cute to be mad at. It's way too cute. Although I say

190
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:11,750
that now, something's going to happen. All right. So who do I give those to? This is a cute game.

191
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:25,480
What are you doing? I'm playing. I don't know what I was going to say. Up. I'm playing up.

192
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,220
Like the movie up. I've never seen up. I just know that there's an old guy and there's a dog

193
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:40,710
and there are balloons. I don't know anything about this movie. I've never seen it. But, you know,

194
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,170
I feel like I've seen the movie though, right? The problem with really popular movies that you

195
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,890
haven't seen is it's almost like you feel like you've seen the entire movie because everybody's

196
00:32:50,890 --> 00:33:05,769
talked about every scene. So I feel like I've seen it already. I go down here. Watch it now.

197
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:25,500
You would like it. I know I would. I just, I feel like I've already seen it. What is this for? Hold

198
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:33,160
on. You should be arrested because you haven't seen it. I don't think seeing, not seeing up is

199
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:39,910
as outrageous as not seeing Star Wars or something or Lord of the Rings. I know I've never seen the

200
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:47,690
Lord of the Rings, but wait, is this a shortcut? That is. What else? Why is there a shortcut?

201
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,299
You're going to cry. You should watch it with Holly. You're going to cry.

202
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:06,819
Comrade Mark, recruit you from the surface. Fantastic. There's tons of work to do. Finish

203
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:11,699
the mech ant. Let's see. The mandibles need a final heat treatment up in the forage room.

204
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:19,000
About to turn that back on. We need to patch up the pipe works. Okay. We'll need that to supply

205
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,599
the mech ant. Oh, and it still needs three more legs to be attached. Oh God. I think we're waiting.

206
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:32,199
This thing's crushing me. That was bad. It seemed kind of dangerous. I think we're waiting on

207
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:37,380
deliveries for two of them from engineering. What are you waiting for comrade? Get to it.

208
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:48,070
Okay. So I need to get parts for this. I need mech ant legs, water pipes and propellant pipes

209
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:57,559
and mandibles. Where am I supposed to find this shit? What's this? Living quarters. All right. I

210
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:06,340
got to find eggs? Where do I shoot somebody with a laser? Oh, here we go. What does this do?

211
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:19,239
Oh, all right. That brings it up there. Bunker W. Why? What do you mean Bunker W? What?

212
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:45,380
All right. Attach this. How do I attach it? Is this with the mouth? How does this work? How

213
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,860
do I do this? It looks like a leg. Yeah, it does. But how do I move it? Oh shit. Okay. I have to

214
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:59,269
snap it in place. Okay. What? All right. I need two more legs. Is your favorite bug? Um,

215
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:12,260
that bait. My favorite bug is probably, I don't know, but I just, I love the ball so much

216
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:30,280
and I can't decide. Um, I can't, is it stuck here? Oh yeah. Probably a honeybee. Honeybees are

217
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:38,039
probably just fucking distracting me and it's pissing me off. I don't care. You know what?

218
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:48,679
Okay. No, it's honeybee. Honeybees are, they make this delicious goo. How would you not like a

219
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:59,340
honeybee? I'm not supposed to wedge that out of there. He's so grumpy. No, I'm kidding. I swear

220
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:09,210
to God. Earwigs. I don't, I don't, I don't mind earwigs. I think they're fine. How do I get this

221
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:24,599
out? Out through there? Earwigs are the worst. They really aren't though. What do they do that's so

222
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:33,159
bad? What, what does an earwig do that's so bad? Nothing. They just kind of exist. What's wrong?

223
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,000
Mosquitoes are probably the worst insect without a doubt. And ticks. Mosquitoes, ticks and fleas

224
00:37:43,000 --> 00:38:01,880
probably, right? Like this. All the biting insects. Fuck that. Can I not pull this guy out? Yeah,

225
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,599
mosquitoes are the worst. They don't, there's no benefit at all for a mosquito. They just cause

226
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:23,340
problems. They just cause problems only. What about the leech? Yeah, but the leech had some medical

227
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:33,619
backing, right? Weren't leeches, didn't they have a purpose? What the fuck? A leech is not a bug

228
00:38:33,619 --> 00:39:00,679
though. Yeah, that's true. Ah! Okay. Oh my God, there's more. Fuck you, stupid goddamn. All right,

229
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:29,750
I'm fine. I'm just trying to rush. I have to stop. Slow down. Oh, come on. So what the hell? How do I

230
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:45,590
get? I have to be able to pull these guys out, right? Is there a device I get? Wait. Oh, I got

231
00:39:45,590 --> 00:40:17,980
one. Is that going to work? Um, how do I get this back? Wait, will this connect in here? Oh shit!

232
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,659
That's how you do it. All right. So you have to connect them. How am I going to get this back?

233
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:47,449
He's so fucking high. How do I get it out? It's getting called out right now. I'm fine.

234
00:40:53,659 --> 00:41:21,670
Let's drag it out. Come on, pull it up. Yeah. Okay. I need to make a bridge here. I'm good enough.

235
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:38,489
So now I have to fuck. How am I supposed to do this? I got to pull it up and then turn it.

236
00:41:38,489 --> 00:42:05,449
I'm not going to die. Here we go. All right. Now jump it this way. You look confused. I kind

237
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:53,739
of am confused. I kind of am confused, man. Heat bugs or riot. No, fuck you. No. Oh, it did. It

238
00:42:53,739 --> 00:43:06,920
beat it for me. Good. Oh, there's one. Okay. He got it. Okay. So they transfer it. Oh, all right.

239
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:17,590
Let me just get a sip of water. How many of you guys with just room temp water out of a glass?

240
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:29,110
You can just badlands chugs that and it's not a problem. Room temp water out of a,

241
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:37,909
just a room temp glass. That's gone. It's gone instantly. Okay. I need, there's another piece

242
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:41,190
over here. There's enough. What was it? What was the other one? Is there more than one here?

243
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:57,130
I don't think there's more than one now. That's easy. Ah, that's very helpful actually.

244
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:17,579
Okay. So now there's another leg here. I got to connect it to this one. So I get it. Everyone,

245
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:35,880
that was Pepe laughing. You're really funny. Just for your information. Webbed is 10 bucks.

246
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,500
Wait, am I connected? Do I have to connect this one to that one? Is that how this works?

247
00:44:43,139 --> 00:45:09,429
Is it going to connect to this? Do I have to do that? Well, I have to bring it up there.

248
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:24,219
I have to take it to the mech. Where's the mech from here? Up, upright. Come here. Get over here.

249
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:53,980
I screwed it up. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. Get up. Get up. Oh my God. I soft locked it.

250
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:31,190
Okay. Now come here. Bugs have milk. I don't think so. Get this fucking thing up. I don't know, man.

251
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:42,980
I don't think, no. What are you talking about? Why are you saying such a weird thing? No. Whatever.

252
00:46:42,980 --> 00:47:41,829
Start over. Just start the whole fucking thing over. Use more than one web. Stop being bad.

253
00:47:41,829 --> 00:48:08,519
Yeah, but I'm trying to pull it up. I want it to go up more. I want it to go up more. How do I get

254
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:29,059
it to go up more? Connect it at both ends. It is on both ends. How do I pull it up? You need more

255
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:46,570
lines. No, I don't. Look at how many fucking lines there are. Put them on the ceiling instead.

256
00:48:46,570 --> 00:49:22,230
Get up here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But go. This is for you. I think it made it. I think.

257
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:45,219
Let's go find out. Eat bugs. Shut up. What is that sound? All right. Look it. We got another leg.

258
00:49:46,309 --> 00:50:18,099
Guys, we've got another leg. Connect it. Okay. It's one more leg. I have not been down to the lower

259
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:44,820
right. Let's figure it out. Can't talk right now. Sorry. Oh, a giant. Can you please be a little

260
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:54,659
bit more quiet? You almost woke up my dog. He needs rest. I was supposed to start barking.

261
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:01,659
I was about to try to do a real dog bark. Realistic dog barking. You know what I mean?

262
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:19,400
Kind of in the realm of. I caught that one really early. I caught that one very early. I like the

263
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:27,619
song. Yeah, the soundtrack's cute. Good day, comrade. Everyone here is getting really thirsty.

264
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:47,909
Oh, me too. You think you could turn the water back on so we can have a drink? Yeah. Drop this

265
00:51:47,909 --> 00:52:01,510
somehow. No bark, Andy. How do I turn that on? Jeremy, maybe if you played the game, you just

266
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:08,460
would figure it out eventually. Now I have to ask a fake rhetorical question and go like this and

267
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:27,000
wait till somebody says the answer. Uh, where am I? I need water. Oh, boss bite. Is it boss bite,

268
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,539
I think. Look, that's a Mega Man door. That's the Mega Man door before the boss. You know what I'm

269
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:47,880
saying? This is a Mega Man boss fight door. I told you it was. I'm always doing a boneless. Get it?

270
00:52:47,880 --> 00:53:00,170
Hey, you skater girl. Hit me, skate herb. I'm trying to teach all them ants to skate. They

271
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:06,789
got the right attitude, but still working on technique. You want to show them how it's done?

272
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:15,260
Yes. Heck yes. They're depart ants. We about to see some sick moves.

273
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:23,110
Rip board, release board, rip board, release board, rip board, release board, rip board.

274
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:44,969
What? W. That was pretty sick. What am I supposed to be doing? Oh, I have to grip the board

275
00:53:44,969 --> 00:54:04,380
and jump. I don't know. I don't get it. Oh, what a cool trick. What a cool trick that was. Okay.

276
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:21,820
Um, I can. Oh, I can grow. I need to be on the board. How do I? Okay. How do I turn? How do I

277
00:54:21,820 --> 00:55:05,340
restart? I don't know. I have no idea what the board is. Okay. Grip the board. Hold on. Hold on.

278
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:32,099
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's the B. All right. I got the B. I got BB. B. Shit. That was

279
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:41,880
going to be cool looking. Can I grab this and put it back up there? There we go. All right. Wait,

280
00:55:41,880 --> 00:56:12,860
wait, wait, wait, wait. Get over there. I need another B. I need E. God damn it. Oh, this way.

281
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:22,500
I see. All right. I got to go this way and then come down there. All right. Check it out. Here we

282
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:40,219
go. Come on. What the fuck? Use webs? I can't use webs. It pulls me off the board. Does it? Yeah. I

283
00:56:40,219 --> 00:57:11,849
can't. If I use a web, it takes me off the board. That was pretty sick. All right. I got to go up.

284
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:33,699
I need E. An E and a B and I'm done. My head just caved in. Where's the last B? Right there.

285
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:55,539
I wasn't supposed to do this in a certain time limit, was I? Hope not. Hey, skater girl. You're

286
00:57:55,539 --> 00:58:13,190
ready to skate? No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want to skate anymore. I already did it. I can

287
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:21,449
just leave? Wait, did I get a skateboard as a present? Where am I? All the way over here.

288
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:33,210
I named my dog. Can you please bark back to my dog? No, I'm not going to bark at your dog

289
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:49,670
because me barking at your dog is an embarrassment for me. I'm not barking. I'm way too far away. I'm

290
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:59,690
going back to the ant kingdom. Is the music too annoying? All right. I need to go. I can't get,

291
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:06,389
I got to go up to where the mech is and then right and then down. All right. I think so.

292
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:25,019
Will you please just bark, please? Oh my God. Okay. Fine. Is that what you want to hear?

293
00:59:25,019 --> 01:00:12,659
You want me to just wait? Is that good? The only thing I see is somebody very, very long,

294
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:20,860
long term viewer, mod, community members been around for a fucking decade. It's an all lower

295
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:42,760
case. Just wrote strange. What does it even sound like? That sounds weird. I did. I actually didn't

296
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:49,239
mean to have that on. I kind of want to, I kind of want to keep this on just like this for a little

297
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:57,400
while. How does it, how much more different do I actually sound? Do I sound even that much more

298
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:05,510
different? How absurdly different do I probably a lot, right? Probably a lot. I would take a quick

299
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:12,260
master. I have to play with the audio setup one last time before I get rid of it forever. I can't

300
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,380
believe I just fucking barked. I'm genuinely unhappy about that. Like why did I do that? What

301
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:23,460
was the point? Like I don't know why I did that. It's like 15,000 people here, four of you were

302
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,150
telling me to bark and you said it like 50 times. And then finally I was like, I thought, I thought

303
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:33,829
that you five people were like a thousand people because I keep looking over and seeing, dude,

304
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:38,389
you should buy dog likes when dogs bark. Bark at my dog. I'm like, fine. I'll do it. Okay.

305
01:01:45,429 --> 01:01:53,099
It was not 20%. It was definitely not. I got to go try to go right.

306
01:01:55,210 --> 01:02:03,980
You can't go right from, I need to go this way. Please, please say Aaron in the deep voice.

307
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:22,420
Okay. Was there another leg over here that I didn't get? How do I get out of here? What about up?

308
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:38,380
Okay. Please do a pull. No, I, you just got like your fucked up weird fringe guy voice.

309
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:46,340
I just did it. I just tried to realistically bark like a dog. No, you're not getting any more.

310
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,659
That's what you're getting. That's what you're getting. That's what you're getting today.

311
01:02:55,369 --> 01:03:02,199
No more. Okay. Wait, I need to get water, right? Okay. Water pump is down.

312
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,940
Helmet pump is over there and the pump power station. All right, let's go down.

313
01:03:07,940 --> 01:05:07,739
Shit. I need to make a bridge. No. Oh, a gear has to go there. What the hell happened? Oh,

314
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:15,860
it's too slippery. That's really slippery. All right. I gotta be careful. Ow. This mudslides

315
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,570
getting dangerous. I'm trying to repair this power station to open up access to the pumps,

316
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:27,139
but I slipped and fell. Would you lend me a mandible? Yeah. How do I get there? Can I help

317
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:50,920
you get up there? Do I actually have to pull you up? No. Is that helping? Oh, just like the movie

318
01:05:50,920 --> 01:06:16,599
Up. Seen it. I'm going to go up. That work. Thanks for helping me out. You're a true friend.

319
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:25,239
Now I just need to find a way to fix this gearbox. Okay. So I help. I think I have an idea. All right,

320
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:40,119
check this out. What if I go like this? Not what I wanted to do. Can I attach this to the ceiling

321
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:55,590
over there? Or should I swing? I don't know what to do. You're killing him. I didn't kill him.

322
01:06:56,309 --> 01:07:23,059
What do I do? Maybe I should fall. It's like mouth skin. What's happening? It called lips.

323
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:30,250
I'm telling you. No, it's mouth. I have this mouth skin. All right, hold on. What if I...

324
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:58,340
Okay. Very obviously. Will it eventually pull it the other way? It will. Okay. Kind of. I don't. I

325
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:19,859
need to understand physics. Hold on. All right. It's going. It's going. It's going. It's going.

326
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:50,810
All right. Got that. Got that. Okay. Now I got to pull this. And then, all right,

327
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:55,659
this is going to get pulled over here too. So let me get on the other side. Like this.

328
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:49,850
Oh, stupid. What the fuck? What? What are you talking about? All right. Wait, wait, wait. Do

329
01:09:49,850 --> 01:10:11,029
a think. Do a think. You need to think. Hold on. Just give me a net so I can not keep falling down.

330
01:10:16,899 --> 01:10:34,409
That longer? I think that's it. Here we go. Ready? See you later. Oh. Oh. I didn't get the grub.

331
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:54,840
That's okay. I don't want the rock. Stop picking the rock up. Get out of my way.

332
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:08,100
I'm working. Dude, seriously. Dude, get out of the way. Just get out of the way. Just get out of the

333
01:11:08,100 --> 01:12:07,800
fucking way. Get out of the way. It's wedged into the middle of the rocks. Get out. Thank you. Hey,

334
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,359
I'm doing a cellar spider pattern, okay? They're the most intelligent of all the spiders.

335
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,359
You know why? Because they don't do this symmetrical web. They do this mess of a fucking web because it

336
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:26,020
catches more shit. The symmetrical pretty design. No. Cellar spiders understand what they're doing.

337
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:52,380
They do an incredibly messy design. It catches way more shit. Now get over here. Finally. Now extract

338
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:58,329
it. We're good. Did somebody fact check that? No, no, no. You can. Absolutely. Please do.

339
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:07,029
Cellar spider has an incredibly erratic design because it catches more stuff. Look it up.

340
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:33,130
Now what? It's true. Cellar spiders construct loose haphazard webs often in corners to catch

341
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,689
insect prey. They hang upside down on the web until a food item gets tangled. Once prey is captured,

342
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:44,500
a cellar spider vigorously shake their webs to further entangle their meal. That's what I'm

343
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:51,340
saying. Can everyone here that's telling me that I'm not a scientist go get the grub? I don't think

344
01:13:51,340 --> 01:14:08,890
I can. I'll try. That cog better still be in there. Cellar spiders are really good for you.

345
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:16,579
They're just terrifying looking. Cellar spiders are really strange looking. They're kind of like

346
01:14:16,579 --> 01:14:23,859
these white, yellowy, wispy looking. They have really long legs. They're really strange looking.

347
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:57,529
One and why I didn't take that one off. Oh, you piece of shit. It's not enough. It's not enough.

348
01:14:57,529 --> 01:15:24,699
It might be enough. All right. I'm just trying to rush. Just stop rushing. That should do it.

349
01:15:26,920 --> 01:16:06,300
Like that. One, two. Okay. There's one. That one's in a perfect spot. There it is. How am I supposed

350
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:21,739
to do that? Everything's in place. It's fine. I have to grab into there. It's going to be actually,

351
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:27,210
that's going to be hard to get. I have to shoot into there and down. That's going to be hard.

352
01:16:54,199 --> 01:17:06,359
Okay. So I powered the station up. Very cool. Now this is the gas station. Did I go this way?

353
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:17,180
So I got power and now I need fuel. What are the dumb bullshit do I have to do here?

354
01:17:20,779 --> 01:17:36,260
Take another grub. That's for sure. That's going to be a huge pain in the ass.

355
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:46,010
My patience is so low. So low. I just, it takes so much for me to, I know what I have to do here,

356
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:55,399
right? But the prospect of doing this is like, it's like I can tear fucking colors in my head.

357
01:17:55,399 --> 01:18:01,779
I just don't want to do it. Does anybody else feel that? I see the solution. Like

358
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:09,140
gecko gecko gecko gecko gecko click. But my brain is just like, don't you want to just like

359
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:12,020
roll around on the ground? You know, I just don't want you to just want to roll around.

360
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah. I kind of just want to just like roll around on the ground. I don't want to like do this.

361
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:27,539
I don't want to do this. I know what I have to do. It's ADHD. I know, but still it's just, I

362
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:36,039
know what I have to do. I think my problem a lot of times I'm trying to music down.

363
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:47,399
The music's cool, but I can't even hear myself think. Um, I think it's because my brain has

364
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:55,850
already seen the solution. Puzzle games to me get really weird because I get this puzzle,

365
01:18:55,850 --> 01:19:02,010
this big elaborate thing that I need to do. And in my head I see the solution. I've seen it finished

366
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:07,899
and I sit there and I go, I know what that looks like finished. It's this process of getting to

367
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:14,260
finishing that, that I don't want to do because I'm a very visual person. I can, these two are

368
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:19,140
connected in my brain right now. I'm watching it. They're connected. I'm looking at it right now.

369
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:24,199
It's literally a moving video in my head. I'm watching it. I just don't want to do it. He's

370
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:42,710
too smart. I don't want to connect these two fucking dryer vents. Okay. But I know I have to,

371
01:19:42,710 --> 01:20:57,659
so I have to do it. No. Connect to the other one. Excuse me? Okay. Is that one? Oh, what a shit job.

372
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:18,380
Yeah. Is that wrong? Is that, was that, was it wrong? The one on the, I'm very confused.

373
01:21:18,380 --> 01:22:05,380
It was not wrong. So what the hell's wrong? Do it! Why won't it do it? They're on. They're on,

374
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:17,750
right? That definitely looks on. They're both connected. Okay. They're both on. I'll turn

375
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:45,350
the machine on, right? Cool. Two grubs. That's pretty good deal. Where does this go? Okay. Two

376
01:22:45,350 --> 01:23:04,260
of these. Awesome. Down there. There's a third cog over there. Okay. I gotta get them all up there.

377
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:26,380
You're reading this, please sing the victory song. SpongeBob? All right. Wait, wait, wait.

378
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:52,699
No, no, no, no. I gotta bring it back down here. Stay up here. Okay. You actually have the

379
01:23:52,699 --> 01:24:04,020
behavioral patterns of a spider. You just confused me so much that now I, I didn't get the,

380
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:11,020
now I, now I don't? How do I have the behavioral patterns of a spider? Doesn't make any sense.

381
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:35,539
I don't, I'm not a spider. I think lizard is more accurate. Spiders are too delicate and they're

382
01:24:35,539 --> 01:24:44,390
too calculated. Some of my happiest days have been just baking in the sun with my mouth open,

383
01:24:44,390 --> 01:25:19,159
lying down on the ground. So I think I'm more of a, I think I'm more of a lizard. One, two. So yeah,

384
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:46,949
I would be a lizard and not cool looking either. I would, I'm not going to be a cool looking lizard.

385
01:25:46,949 --> 01:25:57,130
But one, I would be the lizard that just lie there. They just lick their eyes. No, I'm not,

386
01:25:57,130 --> 01:26:05,430
it's not, I'm not going to even say it. And when they run away, they do this thing where they go

387
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:12,300
like this, like they kind of shake their like arms like this and they kind of slide from side

388
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:24,569
to side and shake, shake, shake, shake, shake while they run. What is that? That's a crested gecko.

389
01:26:24,569 --> 01:26:39,930
You're describing a spider. That's not a spider. No, the reason why you guys think I'm a spider is

390
01:26:39,930 --> 01:26:47,739
because of the erratic movements, which I understand. I get that aspect of it. You know,

391
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:50,619
sometimes you're just looking at a spider, they'll just be sitting there and all of a sudden they just

392
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:56,949
go like this. They just rip another direction and it's like, holy shit, the thing moves so weirdly

393
01:26:56,949 --> 01:27:05,109
and so fast. I don't, I can't, I don't like it. A squirrel does that too. A squirrel does do that.

394
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:13,699
A spider sometimes will be like this and then two or three seconds later with you'll blink

395
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:20,939
and it'll glitch and it'll be turning this way like that. It'll be like this. It's really weird.

396
01:27:20,939 --> 01:27:33,609
Okay, so those are both in there. It's one more spot here, so that should do it.

397
01:27:33,609 --> 01:28:03,590
Herman knows about the glitch spiders. I mean, spiders are weird.

398
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:22,659
Goodness, he's living in a video game. No, I wouldn't be a cool animal. Just clear the board,

399
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:28,380
clear the board, clear the board, clear the board and I'll be fine. What is it? Is it stuck to the

400
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:47,050
ground here? What the fuck is going on? Please. Can I pull this up? No, I can't. Okay. Well,

401
01:28:47,050 --> 01:29:02,260
I can do this. At least I can do this. No, dude, seriously. Got it! All right, I filled it up.

402
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:13,819
There's enough gas. I think that's good. So now what? Now I filled the gas. You'd be like a magpie.

403
01:29:13,819 --> 01:29:21,380
Yeah, I probably would be a bird. This is really annoying. It's constantly yelling non-secretors.

404
01:29:21,380 --> 01:29:30,890
Birds kind of do that. Birds, I actually would be a bird. I'm trying to think of an animal that

405
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:36,380
would randomly for no reason just say they're great without any context. They just say it for

406
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:46,460
no reason. Yeah. Have you walked into a house with somebody that has birds that talk and you

407
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:57,210
just sit there kind of on the couch and it's just like, they're great. Fuck off. Stupid. Oh, you're,

408
01:29:57,210 --> 01:30:14,699
you're a pretty bird. Oh, who wants a treat? Who wants a treat? They all do that. Look at that.

409
01:30:14,699 --> 01:30:23,340
It's so creepy because it's always in their voice. The voice of the person who owns the bird.

410
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:31,510
It's terrifying and it sounds almost a little bit robotic. A little bit. It's a weird tape recording

411
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:41,189
version of that person saying it. It's so strange. It's like, um, it kind of, hold on. I'm gonna take

412
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:47,210
a second here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna be a fucking weirdo for a minute just in case anyone was trying

413
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:57,859
to chill today. Does this work? Does this work? Yeah, it works. Let's pretend I have a bird.

414
01:30:57,859 --> 01:31:07,270
I'm gonna just pretend I have a bird back here. I got a new bird. But weirdly enough, it always

415
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:14,149
sounds, let's say it's an old lady that has the bird. The bird will be doing this whole routine.

416
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:22,390
Who's a pretty bird? It's like, holy shit. That was like, it was like grandma talking.

417
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:35,159
Let's see if I can get this. Hold on. It's good. Test it. It kind of sounds like this,

418
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:44,380
but not this deep here. Hold on. Let me fix it. That sounds kind of correct. It's a little better.

419
01:31:44,380 --> 01:32:16,569
Hold on. This was better. Things to say. It's weird. This shit sounds exactly like this.

420
01:32:16,569 --> 01:32:20,760
I've been in houses with people with birds before and it's just fucking terrifying in a way.

421
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:29,539
So imagine that that's, that's literally grandma's voice and you hear shit like this.

422
01:32:57,189 --> 01:33:03,319
Anybody not gonna go see that fucking movie ever? Okay, here we go. There's a bird in the house.

423
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:23,420
Who's a pretty bird? Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?

424
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:38,390
Oh, who's a pretty bird? Who wants a kiss? Who wants a kiss?

425
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:49,960
This goes on for 10 to 12 hours straight every day. This is scary. It's like scary.

426
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:07,100
That is scary. That is actually really scary. You guys know what I'm talking about though,

427
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:10,699
right? You guys get it. You know what I mean. You know what I mean by this, don't you?

428
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:18,890
I'm not crazy. That's actually what it's like. It sounds like a fucking old talkback tape recording

429
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:24,579
version of the person speaking, talking. It's fucking weird. What does it sound like? I don't

430
01:34:24,579 --> 01:34:38,100
know. I'm scared to press it again. Oh, who's a pretty bird? It's weird, man. It's actually

431
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:59,140
fucking weird. You're fucked up. No, I'm telling you. I'm the smart one. Reconnect the propellant

432
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:09,770
pipes. Okay, so that's done. It's impossible for me to get killed. I actually don't even know how

433
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:20,329
that killed me. It's not even possible to die there. All right, so now I need to put the mandible

434
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:29,899
through the forge. Reconnect the water pipes. Reconnect the water pipes. Where am I? I have

435
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:37,350
to go down. Down to the lower right. Wasn't that where I was before? Isn't this the water

436
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:47,100
area down here? There's this. I forget where to go. This looks like a water pipe to me, doesn't it?

437
01:35:47,100 --> 01:36:04,489
It would be less terrifying without the who wants a kiss mwah mwah mwah. But that's what they all

438
01:36:04,489 --> 01:36:26,649
say. All right, I gotta focus. Leave me alone. We need to go this way and then down. What do I do

439
01:36:26,649 --> 01:36:41,270
with the grubs again? I don't know. Who's kissing birds? I don't know. People that have birds,

440
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:52,470
they lean in and they... Right? I think so. What are you talking about? Oh, this is how I get down

441
01:36:52,470 --> 01:37:14,149
here. This thing's operational again. People don't do that. I'm telling you they do. A sandwich. All

442
01:37:14,149 --> 01:37:37,590
right, weigh that down. Yeah, they do. All right, it's good. It just sounds like a Disney movie.

443
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:50,180
Disney Pixar's Webbed in theaters May 20th. That sounds like a Disney movie name. It kind of does.

444
01:37:50,180 --> 01:38:15,260
This game's cute though. I like it. Too heavy? Is it too heavy? Oh, I think it's a little too

445
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:42,060
heavy. No, maybe not. I'm panicking right now. Hey, what does that get me? Have you heard of

446
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:48,579
lyrebirds? They can perfectly emulate chainsaw sounds. Yeah, they're just tape recorders. They're

447
01:38:48,579 --> 01:39:23,060
strange tape recorders. Feel like I'm gonna have to bring another one of these down here. Nice.

448
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:32,229
Holy shit. I was supposed to die there. I went in for one second. Wee. All right, what do I need to

449
01:39:32,229 --> 01:40:06,899
do down here? The wheel. All right, first of all, do this so I don't fall in. Yikes. Is that... Okay,

450
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:14,119
put it in. Oh, you fixed the drawbridge already. Outstanding work. Now that the rest of the colony

451
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:24,520
can get through, we can start fixing this place up. I want you to turn it on. Oh, that's the way the

452
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:48,359
bridge is. Auto. Anything else up here? I don't think there's anything I can do up here. I'd have

453
01:40:48,359 --> 01:40:58,810
to connect... I have to do the water pump thing, don't I? Or did I already do that? That connects

454
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:26,069
to here. It wants me to go this way. Can you bark again? What's the spider language? This. Okay,

455
01:41:26,069 --> 01:41:34,010
so I need... What do I need to do? I need another ant leg. Reconnect the water pipes. What do I do

456
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:44,869
that? It said down here, water pipes. Remember? I'm just going back this way. Fuck it, I'm going

457
01:41:44,869 --> 01:42:00,600
this way. Can you make some bird sounds? Probably. I have a fiver page if you want to pay for it.

458
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:12,359
The base is... It's one... For five dollars you get... I do one bird impression. It's about 10

459
01:42:12,359 --> 01:42:18,630
seconds. Twenty dollars would get you two... Would get you three birds of your choice. And then 50

460
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:23,909
dollars gets you 10 birds of your choice. And I have a list of all the birds that I can do.

461
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:34,600
They range from cockatoo to chickadee to hummingbird. I have this... You can pick from a

462
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:40,649
list. If you want, just a little sample. I can give that to you just for a demo for anyone that

463
01:42:40,649 --> 01:42:56,039
was interested. 60 dollars? Yeah. It's really good for background songs, background noise,

464
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:04,329
sampling. I've had a lot of people contact me over the first 10 seconds of songs. Whether it be

465
01:43:04,329 --> 01:43:14,649
rock or rap music, whatever. Make a big intro. Doesn't matter. Genre. A lot of people use it

466
01:43:14,649 --> 01:43:35,689
for a sample. Can I get a preview? Yeah, I mean, you've probably heard me a few times. Actually,

467
01:43:35,689 --> 01:43:43,779
it was part of Hank Fuck's last album. It was featured a few times. He actually did the 50

468
01:43:43,779 --> 01:43:57,880
dollar tier. If you remember, it's a pretty popular song. It has, I think, six or seven

469
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:06,199
hundred plays on Spotify. The opening is kind of like an inside echo-y instead of a cavern.

470
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:15,260
It has this big explosion sound. I think he used it there because I can kind of hear my chickadee.

471
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:22,090
The chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. It kind of blows boom and he goes into his new song.

472
01:44:22,090 --> 01:44:35,109
This was a fun experience. Was that way too dank? Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I am so sorry if

473
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:39,109
that was that. That's why I need a new audio setup. I'm going to get a new audio setup. I'm

474
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:44,149
going to get a brand new setup. No more loud sounds. I swear to God, I promise. My audio is

475
01:44:44,149 --> 01:45:03,159
going to be perfectly, perfectly done. That's not going to happen anymore. I promise. I'm going to

476
01:45:03,399 --> 01:45:07,539
The compressor is going to be perfect. It's going to be perfect highs, perfect lows.

477
01:45:07,539 --> 01:45:12,439
The next time I stream, I promise. Keep it like this. No, no, you don't like loud sounds.

478
01:45:12,439 --> 01:45:16,439
You just say you like loud sounds because you want a loud sound to happen so you can go,

479
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:19,880
oh, shit, that probably fucked up somebody's ears because you think it's funny.

480
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:26,569
Somebody else's ears get fucked up. No, I don't want, I don't want any more loud sounds.

481
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:43,380
No more loud sounds. Here we go. Pump is going in. You got this. Hey, thanks. Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.

482
01:45:46,600 --> 01:46:15,270
Chickadee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. It's going to be hard to get up there.

483
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:22,859
Pump! Do I have to weigh it down or is this going to work? Fuck. Fucking piece of shit.

484
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:42,579
Fucking. Oh, I need another one. Okay. Let's do more. What? Why was that rude? It was me expressing

485
01:46:44,489 --> 01:47:03,539
anger. Calm down. They're in the water? Stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots. Fucking goddamn

486
01:47:03,539 --> 01:47:17,100
stupid fucking goddamn game. Oh, they are here, yeah. Oh, is there whoever's on the ghost team?

487
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:34,420
Shut the fuck up right now. This is going to be such a pain in the ass. Oh, yikes. This is going

488
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:44,300
to be hell. How am I going to do this? I'm going to have to do it one at a time. One at a time.

489
01:47:44,300 --> 01:48:10,300
Don't you wait on that one. Perfect. Isn't this guy supposed to be trying to find sponsors for

490
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:19,420
his streams? What? Because I said stupid fucking goddamn fucking idiots. You can swear and get

491
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:43,560
sponsors, right? But I stopped doing that. Just not very good ones. Not good ones. I'll be fine.

492
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:57,939
I'll be fine. There it is. All right. Water pipes reconnected. Pumping going on. I hope you don't

493
01:48:57,939 --> 01:49:09,689
get any. Why not? Why? You don't want me to get... Why not? Hey, I want them. I'm going to get them.

494
01:49:09,689 --> 01:49:31,079
Indram, I'm going to cancel my sponsorship. Okay, so I think I've been down in the ant

495
01:49:31,079 --> 01:49:40,279
place for a long time. I need one more ant leg and I need the ant mouth. So how do I...

496
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:54,300
What do I go from here? Oh, it's filling the tank. All right. What happens if it goes all the way up?

497
01:49:54,300 --> 01:50:05,670
Is the door going to open? Oh, cool. All right. So now I can leave through here. Oh, my goodness.

498
01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:36,420
It's not going to kill me, right? Oh, my fucking God. Still going? Is it still going? Where's the

499
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:56,460
elevator there? What is this? The no talk stream? I haven't shut the hell up in 15 straight minutes.

500
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:05,510
Okay, I need one more leg. I did the power. I did the gas. I did all this. Water pipes,

501
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:20,229
propellant pipes, electricity. I need another ant leg down here maybe. What did I get? What did

502
01:51:20,229 --> 01:51:54,149
I miss an ant leg? I need to go up. What's this twitch stream? So where am I now? So this is back

503
01:51:54,149 --> 01:52:00,439
to the top of the ant hill. I don't want to leave the ant hill. I don't want to leave.

504
01:52:00,439 --> 01:52:24,310
There's as much more to be done. Wrong way. Yeah, well, come on. So going up from here takes me out.

505
01:52:24,310 --> 01:52:42,739
So I need to go left. This is not going into the highlight. Um, it is. Okay, so left from here,

506
01:52:42,739 --> 01:52:52,060
I think. I'm gonna go left. Okay, so this is... I gotta hand it down here. Have I been over here?

507
01:52:52,060 --> 01:53:19,609
I don't remember. I don't... I have not been over there. Fire? So I gotta put the fire out probably?

508
01:53:19,609 --> 01:53:32,840
Suck up the water from here? You gotta forge the mandible. Well, somebody has to give it to me.

509
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:49,430
What do I get it? Do I have to bring it all the way over here? I can't go in there like Mario.

510
01:53:49,430 --> 01:54:00,649
Are you ever gonna play Yakuza Zero like you promised? I know I said it a while ago, but

511
01:54:00,649 --> 01:54:06,390
if somebody made a compilation of all the times I have lied on this stream or have not said the

512
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:11,930
thumb the thing I said I was going to do, it would be a four and a half up to five hour long video.

513
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:18,069
So I have to throw a mandible in here to forge it. Where do I get it?

514
01:54:18,069 --> 01:54:28,250
And I imagine it would be done to the music of... what's that? Overture?

515
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:47,060
You'd have to replay that song three or four times. All right, there's one more leg and then the mouth.

516
01:54:49,539 --> 01:54:56,949
Where is it? Down here? I'm gonna go there. I think I haven't... I don't think I've been down there.

517
01:54:56,949 --> 01:55:06,760
I've been here. Yeah, it's right here, but what the fuck? How do I get it?

518
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:14,710
Where's this piece? There's a piece that I haven't found yet. No, I want to go down.

519
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:27,899
Okay, that's the 1812 Overture. All right, here we go. Thought you were gonna get me.

520
01:55:28,979 --> 01:56:52,460
Nope. Oh my god! That just scared the hell out of me. You fucking idiot. This fucking rock needs

521
01:56:52,460 --> 01:57:14,819
to get out of the way. Thank you. Interact with us! I'm... don't... look at how much I'm concentrating.

522
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:27,979
I'm sorry, if I'm diffusing a bomb, what wire do I cut next? Dance for us. Dance for us. You

523
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:40,460
should dance. Which wire? Who's the bomb? I need to fucking focus. We'll chat in just a minute.

524
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:52,149
Hold on. But you just keep failing over and over again. Just talk to us. Did I fail that time?

525
01:57:52,149 --> 01:58:23,930
I better still save. It's there. It's there. I'm fine. Looks good. No, I just need... there it is.

526
01:58:26,140 --> 01:59:18,979
Okay. Why did I... what was I doing? What am I doing? Seriously? We gotta go up. Okay. No, don't slide.

527
01:59:18,979 --> 01:59:56,600
Go up. And then hand it to you. Check this out. Don't fire the gun. Oh my fucking god. Just...

528
01:59:56,600 --> 02:00:06,550
I'm gonna scream. I'm so annoyed. I just... oh, I can see the solution. I can see it. I can

529
02:00:07,029 --> 02:00:25,500
feel the solution. I just can't do the solution. Get the fuck over here! Oh my goodness,

530
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:34,789
I'm gonna lose my mind. Slow down. I can't slow down. I see the solution. It's already done.

531
02:00:34,789 --> 02:00:43,909
My brain is like, do it already. He is standing, giving a peace sign, taking a picture with all

532
02:00:43,909 --> 02:00:47,909
the webs in the right place. And I'm just fucking pissed at him. It's like, dude, I know... I can

533
02:00:47,909 --> 02:01:03,539
see you done. I'm just... I need to get to it. Like he said, you took a vacation photo. Okay.

534
02:01:03,539 --> 02:01:14,939
Take this down. Here it comes. Okay. Square one. Check it out. Slow down. Watch this. Bridge.

535
02:01:14,939 --> 02:01:22,439
It was that easy. It was seriously... it was that simple. I just had to slow down.

536
02:01:22,439 --> 02:01:27,340
Now that should go back up here. But I think... I feel like a bug just crawled over my hand.

537
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:57,689
Okay. Where... where is it? There it is. This has to go here, which will drop it. Okay. Now

538
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:11,800
this goes where? Nobody else has to pick this up, right? Over here? Right there. So now this comes

539
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:36,489
down. It's just a puzzle game with roguelike elements. Yeah. You're moving from point A to

540
02:02:36,489 --> 02:03:11,989
point B. Yeah. That's accurate. Stop sliding. Slow down. I am. See, he just keeps... his forward

541
02:03:11,989 --> 02:03:31,510
momentum keeps going. I'm not touching it. No, just burger boy technique. Just fucking burger

542
02:03:31,510 --> 02:04:11,770
boy technique. Uh, that last one is here. So now I got all the legs. Jeremy, you're spending so much

543
02:04:11,770 --> 02:04:16,229
fucking time with these ants. I mean, there's other shit to do with them. You're spending a

544
02:04:16,229 --> 02:04:21,159
lot of time with these fucking ants, dude. Like, you've been outside a lot. You're just like,

545
02:04:21,159 --> 02:04:23,960
you're digging around looking for fucking ants. I don't... I don't know what is...

546
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:49,270
getting a little concerned about you. Get out there. Quick. All right. Good. Done. Two hours

547
02:04:49,270 --> 02:05:02,390
with the ants. I think this game's only three hours long. I could be wrong though. The mandible

548
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:15,510
through the forge. Where is this mandible? Here? Is it only because I haven't gone? Like, right?

549
02:05:17,659 --> 02:05:30,229
Right? Down, right? Down, right? Left? Should I connect these? Connect the pipes to the ants.

550
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:42,899
Connect this? What do I connect it? On top? Oh, look at it. It goes on top.

551
02:05:42,899 --> 02:06:18,020
You're right. Yeah, okay. Please attach. Please attach. Please attach. There it is.

552
02:06:18,020 --> 02:07:07,340
It was attached! What the fuck? Okay, it's attached. Ooh! Attached. Why is it not attaching?

553
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:20,359
It should have attached by now. Why? What is with this fucking elephant nose? Get over here. Attach!

554
02:07:27,739 --> 02:07:47,420
Attach! Attach to the thing! It's running. I have to attach the oil thing. Is it already done?

555
02:07:48,729 --> 02:07:54,779
It doesn't attach. Oh, wait. I had to fuel it. Oh, okay. All right. Whatever. All right. So,

556
02:07:54,779 --> 02:08:07,430
I gotta go right. I haven't been down here. I thought I had to stay on there. No, I gotta go

557
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:20,420
up. Up and to the right. This dude doesn't know what's happening. No, not really. I'm just here

558
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:38,340
for the ride. Okay. I have not gone down to the right. Where am I now? No. I need to go. It's left?

559
02:08:38,340 --> 02:08:47,939
I haven't explored over here. There's a question mark over here. Down here. Where have I not gone?

560
02:08:47,939 --> 02:08:53,880
Go back to the flame thing. Yeah, but I need the mandible. Where do I get the mandible?

561
02:08:53,880 --> 02:09:16,409
The giant gas tank says left. Yeah, but I need the mandible though. The mandible is at the

562
02:09:16,409 --> 02:09:33,020
giant flame. Did I not pick it up or something? Chad is wrong. Are they? Where am I? Okay. I'm

563
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:41,939
kind of going down to the furnace again here. Okay. So, this is the gas. Do I have to go all

564
02:09:41,939 --> 02:10:02,420
the way back over here? Over here? I have to go over here, don't I? I am lost. Yeah. I am lost.

565
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:12,340
Oh, just respawn me. Just fucking give me a checkpoint. I'm just fucking going so fast.

566
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:45,060
I can see the solution in my head. You motherfucker. Okay. Back. Back. Back. Back.

567
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:52,630
Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Back. Go on a home run. So, now we go over

568
02:10:52,630 --> 02:11:11,829
here. So, where's the mandible? How do I open this? I can't open this. And unless there's

569
02:11:11,829 --> 02:11:17,909
something I can do here, I pull this up or take this with me somehow? I can't scoop this up.

570
02:11:23,369 --> 02:11:36,060
Because there's a big forge over here, but I don't have the mandible. If I touch this, I die.

571
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:49,159
Jump in the forge? Is it below this room? I've been in all these rooms already. I feel like I

572
02:11:49,159 --> 02:12:00,699
need to go all the way left, but I can't open that door. I mean, right here. I can't get in there.

573
02:12:00,699 --> 02:12:15,619
Something weird with this pipe, probably, right? It was down. No. This is the only place I haven't

574
02:12:15,619 --> 02:12:42,460
been. So, I kind of feel like it has to be there. Wait, I can just use this? That's pretty cool.

575
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:59,590
I thought that was a one-time thing. All right. So, where the hell am I going? Find the mandible.

576
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:12,100
I must have just missed it somewhere. I think I just missed it. Just straight up missed it

577
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:25,720
somehow. Because this thing's ready to go. I just need the front. This is the engineering room,

578
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:42,500
which this takes me down here. Maybe it is over here. You passed it? Up one. Medium left. Medium

579
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:54,920
left. What do you mean? Go left. Medium left. I went past it. Medium left. Stop saying you're

580
02:13:54,920 --> 02:14:07,619
breaking the- Okay. Yeah. I see what you're doing. Forge. Oh, nice. Okay. I don't think I did this.

581
02:14:07,619 --> 02:14:28,649
No, I did. No, I didn't. There's got to be grubs up here, right? Whoa. Do you trust chat with your

582
02:14:28,649 --> 02:14:40,149
life? Guys, if there were two doors, because I was doing an IRL stream and one of the doors was

583
02:14:40,149 --> 02:14:48,899
safe. So, it's like a green door and a blue door, right? And behind the green door was a room full

584
02:14:48,899 --> 02:14:54,250
of fire and flames. And if I opened it, I would get engulfed in flames and I would get fucking

585
02:14:54,250 --> 02:15:01,270
annihilated. And on the right door, the other door was an ice cream party. A ton of people in chat

586
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:05,909
would be like, left door. Pepe, left. You should pick the left one. And it would be like, oh,

587
02:15:05,909 --> 02:15:11,590
left door chat? Really? Yeah. Pick the left one. You guys are trying to fucking get me incinerated.

588
02:15:12,149 --> 02:15:22,390
There'd be people in chat saying like, guys, no, dude, like, you're actually going to incinerate

589
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:29,350
them. Like, stop trolling, please. And then they would get timed out because they use too many

590
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:53,350
caps. I did it. I'll heat it up. No health. No health. Yeah. I would take my hand. I'd put my

591
02:15:53,350 --> 02:16:02,039
hand on the door. They'd be like, hey, this one? You guys think it's this one? Oh, chat. That hurt.

592
02:16:02,039 --> 02:16:07,859
That kind of hurt my hand. It's all red. There's a huge red circle. And I would look over and just

593
02:16:07,859 --> 02:16:16,789
be no health. No health. Okay. I guess I'm going in. All right. Send these mandibles through the

594
02:16:16,789 --> 02:16:30,840
forge. No vers. No health. Yeah. And then I would open the door up. It would be, there'd be a bunch

595
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:38,340
of, oh my God, deface, deface, deface. And then the next day, two or three days later, there'd be

596
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:43,879
people in the chat that would be typing, where is he? How come he hasn't streamed in three days?

597
02:16:43,879 --> 02:16:59,290
Where the fuck is he? Excuse me? Where's the stream? He's late. He's supposed to be here. Oh,

598
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:15,459
up there. Where is he? Yeah. People say like, oh, that stream sucked, by the way. Like, that was

599
02:17:15,459 --> 02:17:27,190
like kind of a dumb stream. I wasn't a big fan. That was like, dude, that was like really dangerous.

600
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:52,790
He's going to have some explaining to do when he comes back. That was extra. Let go. Worst stream

601
02:17:52,790 --> 02:18:35,219
of the year. Oh, I was almost there. All right. Stop being panicking. Yes. Another hellfire door

602
02:18:35,219 --> 02:18:56,020
stream. Okay. So I have to send this through the forge. Spinning. That's spinning. Ah, I get it.

603
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:28,579
What are we waiting for? What's wrong? Why is everybody freaking out? Let's not. I told him,

604
02:19:28,579 --> 02:19:54,780
get new audio equipment. It might've been like an audio problem. I'm so impatient. I am so impatient.

605
02:19:54,780 --> 02:20:00,709
I would like Uber Eats a glass of water from fucking down, like in my downstairs. You know

606
02:20:00,709 --> 02:20:08,409
what I'm saying? I would Uber Eats a glass of water. I'm so impatient. I'm so lazy. Just do it

607
02:20:08,409 --> 02:20:14,579
right. Just do it right. Just do it. It's here. It's in front of you. Just do it. That would take

608
02:20:14,579 --> 02:20:30,059
longer. I know. That's what I'm saying. This has taken so much longer because I'm so impatient.

609
02:20:30,059 --> 02:20:52,700
Okay. This over here. Hold up. If it wasn't so heavy. There we go. All right. Oh, the lever.

610
02:20:53,340 --> 02:21:45,530
Okay. Go. Oh, yay. Oh, go like this. Oh, oh, do it. We're so close. Just burger boy it again.

611
02:21:45,530 --> 02:22:06,420
Not a bad idea. Did it work? Okay. So now this is going to get grabbed. I'll wait for the next

612
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:23,030
rotation. Make sure it's only good. Oh, it took you fucking forever. Okay. Now let's pass it

613
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:34,809
through the forge. Here we go. Cool. G'day. It's all heated up. Now we go through here.

614
02:22:34,809 --> 02:22:52,739
Punch that button. Oh, that's how we get over here. Cool. So now I should have the mandible.

615
02:22:52,739 --> 02:23:02,709
I think that's pretty much it. That looks hot. Can I even touch this? This probably kills me if I

616
02:23:02,709 --> 02:23:12,549
touch it. No, it's all right. No, it does not. It's not all right. By the only way I can barely

617
02:23:12,549 --> 02:23:30,860
hear the music. Yeah, it's kind of one single loop, but it's a good loop. Yeah, it's good.

618
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:39,540
Do I have to cool this off? I definitely do. Don't I? Yeah, there's no way I don't have to do that.

619
02:23:39,540 --> 02:24:04,250
Open the hellfire door. Where are you moving this? You duck. You know what a really great word is?

620
02:24:04,250 --> 02:24:47,319
Quench. Thirst quench. Quench is such a great word. Pull it. There we go. Nice and

621
02:24:47,399 --> 02:25:15,530
cool by going into the coolant. Hooray. Got it. There it is. Final piece. Time to put it back on.

622
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:27,000
And then that's it for the ants. Now we're just gonna bring this down. How far down?

623
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:37,639
Let me scope this out first. It's gotta go here. I gotta attach to this. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

624
02:25:37,639 --> 02:26:01,979
Come on. Do it. Come on. Oh, please. Exactly what I wanted. All right. Let's get it.

625
02:26:01,979 --> 02:26:56,889
Mandible attached. Shit. What? Oh, that's not good. Get up. I'm so mad. Okay, let's just go around.

626
02:26:56,889 --> 02:27:19,700
What the fuck am I gonna do about this? Do I have to go all the way around the other side?

627
02:27:19,700 --> 02:28:35,559
Stop touching that. Move. He's so focused. I don't want to mess this up. Gotta attach it up here.

628
02:28:41,530 --> 02:28:49,450
Hey, looking good, comrade. Get over here and let's have a talk. It's ready. It's fueled up.

629
02:28:49,450 --> 02:29:00,700
Mission accomplished. Kind of sloppy, but I did it. It worked out. Hold up a second. The platoon is

630
02:29:00,700 --> 02:29:14,620
moving out. Got seen. We're having a great stream so far. I just joined and I happened to notice

631
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:18,920
that the title says be in a bug. I want to let you know that spiders are not bugs. They are

632
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:30,440
arachnids. So maybe you can change the title to something more appropriate. Thanks. What a beautiful

633
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:45,659
display. Arachnids. No, they're aliens. They're all aliens. Do you guys know the bugs have been

634
02:29:45,659 --> 02:29:52,489
around since 500 trillion years or so before the dinosaurs? They've been around. They're the most

635
02:29:52,489 --> 02:30:02,059
prehistoric creature and they still exist. They were mosquitoes back when the T-Rex was in law

636
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:07,850
school. You know what I'm saying? They've been around for so long and they're still around. How

637
02:30:07,850 --> 02:30:11,979
do they stick around for so long? All right. Send a workforce ahead to help out with your mission on

638
02:30:11,979 --> 02:30:17,500
the surface. They'll have that balloon up and flying before you know it. Dismissed. I got it.

639
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:34,600
Very cool. Okay. Find some fuel. So let's go to the surface. Aliens. I don't know. They're bugs.

640
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:39,299
They have to be aliens. Look at them. They've been around for 500 trillion years or something

641
02:30:39,299 --> 02:30:52,790
and look at the sounds they make. Unfrozen T-Rex lawyer. Why do I feel like that's a show

642
02:30:53,510 --> 02:31:09,559
that is on Adult Swim right now? Okay, so now what? I need one more grub. Oh man,

643
02:31:09,559 --> 02:31:17,979
I really do need one more grub. But I don't, I kind of don't care. Is that where the fly should

644
02:31:17,979 --> 02:31:38,969
hand it into the fly, right? Where's the fly? Harvey Birdman? Harvey Birdman. That's, what is it?

645
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:51,049
Ha ha. Stephen Colbert, right? Stephen Colbert. Ha ha. That's the only thing I know of the whole

646
02:31:51,049 --> 02:32:06,309
show. I remember it being a good show though, right? Wait, you can fly? No, not, not. Ha ha.

647
02:32:08,819 --> 02:32:24,569
I can't. You have to take all the air out. It's like, ha ha. No, there was still air in there.

648
02:32:24,569 --> 02:32:40,920
Look at how cute that is. Ha ha. Stephen Colbert. Well, now I know. All right. All right. All right.

649
02:32:41,079 --> 02:32:44,709
We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting. We're pivoting.

650
02:32:44,709 --> 02:32:50,420
We're pivoting. We're pivoting. Pivot! It's time for a pivot! I'm fucking loud and annoying. I'm

651
02:32:50,420 --> 02:32:58,069
sorry. Your airship mechanic. We're almost ready for the trip of a lifetime. Take these blueprints

652
02:32:58,069 --> 02:33:11,399
that we've got lots to do. Fuel engine patches, map, moth nest, spider webs. Okay. Rest of our

653
02:33:11,399 --> 02:33:16,540
pre-flight checklist. Find a way to patch up the balloon. Bees to the east might be able to help

654
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:22,469
with that. Find a fuel source. Some good concentrated dung would work. Find some of the west.

655
02:33:22,469 --> 02:33:28,569
Attach engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon. Your pilot platform. Oh, I forgot.

656
02:33:28,569 --> 02:33:32,100
If you run into any trouble, just shoot the work bell and we'll reset everything for you.

657
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:37,930
And well, I need to get this stuff first. Oh, shit in this game.

658
02:33:39,459 --> 02:33:44,100
These ants showed up just ahead of you. A quick work of the tree. They've been

659
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:47,940
badgering me with designs for ages, but I've not had the courage to let them try it.

660
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:55,940
Glad you're helping each other though. Your plans seem solid even if they're too bold for me.

661
02:33:55,940 --> 02:34:14,659
Okay. So that's to float away. I need to find some fuel. Where should I go? Oh, cute. I guess

662
02:34:14,659 --> 02:34:27,239
I could go to the west. Go to the bees. I'm going to go east. East. Or should I turn in the fly

663
02:34:27,239 --> 02:34:42,229
stuff first? It's somewhere over here. Where's the fly? Where is he? Where is he? Because I have a

664
02:34:42,229 --> 02:35:10,120
ton of those grubs, don't I? I don't know where the fly is. Fly is more to the left. Where you at?

665
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:33,110
Here? Yeah, he's right up there. Right there. Greetings, spider. I appreciate your visit and

666
02:35:33,110 --> 02:35:45,059
your continued virtue. That's not what those are for? You're the Doctor Who Twitch. I don't

667
02:35:45,059 --> 02:35:49,540
get that reference because I've only seen one episode of Doctor Who ever. And so when would

668
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:56,809
they time travel around like five times and he sees himself five times? I don't know what you

669
02:35:56,809 --> 02:36:06,620
mean by that. Anytime I think of Doctor Who, I could be completely off with this. But I always

670
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:16,059
think of like Doctor Who to me is like a Harry Potter for adults. Is that correct? Does that make

671
02:36:16,059 --> 02:36:27,180
any sense? I feel like it's like the Harry Potter type kind of sci-fi fantasy world as for like a

672
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:35,530
grown-up audience. Not that he's a wizard. No, I'm just saying it's like that fantasy kind of

673
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:53,639
whimsical world of Doctor Who, right? It's very whimsical. Harry Potter isn't sci-fi.

674
02:36:55,799 --> 02:37:06,299
What, you don't remember the part where they were shooting the blasters? Okay, I got a quest for

675
02:37:06,299 --> 02:37:14,329
you. The queen is making a new princess to make a brand new hive. To make a princess she needs

676
02:37:14,329 --> 02:37:20,090
royal jelly and to make the jelly she needs pollen. Only the best pollen. Pink orchid pollen. 20

677
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:29,020
grains should do it. Bring that up to Canopy's Peak. I bet she'd love you. Come on. Okay, very

678
02:37:29,020 --> 02:37:39,100
cool. So okay, give me a... I don't know anything about Doctor Who. I want a just a small quick

679
02:37:39,100 --> 02:37:46,649
paragraph TLDR of... Okay, Doctor Who. Each season of Doctor Who, it's like Final Fantasy,

680
02:37:46,649 --> 02:37:55,270
right? They're not connected. They're independent universes or something. It's like Final Fantasy.

681
02:37:55,270 --> 02:38:07,979
How many seasons of... Yeah, Doctor Who. Explain it to me. What is it? They're all connected. Oh.

682
02:38:07,979 --> 02:38:18,409
Okay, silly person travels with friends. Wacky British alien who time travels and does

683
02:38:18,409 --> 02:38:30,010
fucked up stuff. Immortal alien. Hold on, this person has it. The doctor is an immortal alien

684
02:38:30,010 --> 02:38:41,590
who travels through time sorting out his personal problems with mortals. He's an alien that changes...

685
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:46,680
So he's Rick from Rick and Morty. Alien that changes form every so often and goes on big

686
02:38:46,680 --> 02:38:52,229
space and time adventures and has fun shit and does fun stuff and has funny catchphrases. And he

687
02:38:52,229 --> 02:38:57,190
figures out his problems. I may have just caused the whole internet to fucking hate my life.

688
02:39:01,159 --> 02:39:07,799
So he's Rick from Rick and Morty. How much you guys just turned purple, I think. I think a bunch

689
02:39:07,799 --> 02:39:18,090
you guys turned purple. I'm just fucking kidding. I don't know anything about the show. I've never

690
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:32,389
seen it. I've heard really good things about it. Somebody in All Capital said, it's not Rick and

691
02:39:32,389 --> 02:39:47,770
Morty. I know. I'm just fucking around. I'm fucking with you. I promise. Okay, it's not Rick and

692
02:39:47,770 --> 02:39:55,479
Morty. It's not. But let me just be very clear. Let me be very fair. I see the same amount of

693
02:39:55,479 --> 02:40:22,860
merchandise of Dr. Who at Spencer Gifts that I see from Rick and Morty. I mean, actually fair.

694
02:40:22,860 --> 02:40:33,399
So who's everybody's favorite doctor then? There's a new doctor every season, right?

695
02:40:33,399 --> 02:40:40,819
How many seasons are there? And is it worth getting into? And tell me the truth. I remember

696
02:40:40,819 --> 02:40:44,340
before when we talked about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure one time. We're like, dude, you would

697
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:48,979
love JoJo. Oh my God. It would be like your favorite series ever. Just skip the first season.

698
02:40:48,979 --> 02:40:55,159
Go to episode five of season three. Watch that one twice. And then after you watch that episode

699
02:40:55,159 --> 02:41:01,559
two times, go back and watch the first episode. After you finish the first episode, then you're

700
02:41:01,559 --> 02:41:06,260
free to watch the rest of the series. Let's start at season six. You can actually skip. You know,

701
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:13,639
nevermind. Nevermind. Skip the first five seasons of JoJo. And I'm just like, okay, can I just watch

702
02:41:13,639 --> 02:41:30,100
the show? I'll just watch the show, I guess. Skippers? Yeah. What the hell? Watch it. Don't

703
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:36,379
skip anything. Just watch the whole thing. Yeah, I know, but that's what I mean. Just start at

704
02:41:37,750 --> 02:41:44,920
seasons one through five are pretty good. See, here we go. Here we go. I'm telling you, here we go.

705
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:57,000
Well, man, you know, he's correct though. Seasons one through five are, I'm not so sure about that.

706
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,639
It looks crazy though. I actually, I was going to watch it at one point, but I just kind of didn't.

707
02:42:11,819 --> 02:42:19,209
News is spreading. People are seething. What? What news? What do you mean? What news? News is

708
02:42:19,209 --> 02:42:24,219
spreading. People are mad. What do you mean? News is spreading. What did I do about? I'm going to

709
02:42:24,219 --> 02:42:32,549
apologize. What do I need to apologize for? What is it? What the fuck? I'm so mad because I called

710
02:42:32,549 --> 02:42:39,350
Dr. Who Rick from Rick and Morty. Let me apologize. Let me just really quickly fix this. Let me fix

711
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:50,739
this. I, let me, hold on. I was wrong. I, somebody said just, they gave me a really, really basic

712
02:42:50,739 --> 02:42:55,700
understanding of what the show is. They said it's a guy that travels through space and figures out

713
02:42:55,700 --> 02:43:01,459
his problems with mortals and time travels and has interesting lasers and stuff. So I was like,

714
02:43:01,459 --> 02:43:14,809
okay, so he's Rick Sanchez. And then now everyone wants to kill me. I, but I, I was very uninformed.

715
02:43:14,809 --> 02:43:20,860
I was very uninformed. I, I'm very uninformed. Fucking get him. Bring up the Spencer's argument

716
02:43:20,860 --> 02:43:25,959
again. No, it wasn't an argument. He keeps just jumping on spikes. Everybody relax. What I meant

717
02:43:25,959 --> 02:43:33,110
to say was, listen to me. I, I don't know anything about the show. I don't know anything about the

718
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:36,629
show. I just thought it was like, whatever. I, I didn't know anything about it. And I made it,

719
02:43:36,629 --> 02:43:42,709
I made it a little, little joke that just didn't, didn't go over well. And people thought it was not

720
02:43:42,709 --> 02:43:49,750
funny. And how dare I compare those two shows? I look at, hey, look, the legacy of Dr. Who. Oh,

721
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:53,829
I mean, it's one of the most respected television shows like ever on British television. Right? I

722
02:43:53,829 --> 02:43:59,819
mean, we all know that. Of course I respect it. I'm just, isn't off. This is a cop comment.

723
02:43:59,819 --> 02:44:15,180
Everyone's booing him. Stop booing me. How many, I need, uh, how many more? There's no turning back

724
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:44,649
now. Your career is over. This is, it's just an observation. It wasn't real. It wasn't real.

725
02:44:44,649 --> 02:44:51,659
It was an observation. I was observing. I was just observing. I want to go high. There we go.

726
02:44:51,659 --> 02:45:04,899
There it is. Oh, 20, right? Dig your heels in, dude. You do, you have to start digging your heels

727
02:45:04,899 --> 02:45:22,969
in now. You lost a thousand viewers because of that. I'm sorry. I don't watch TV guys. I really

728
02:45:22,969 --> 02:45:34,170
don't get a lawyer. Can you imagine? I guess we're dealing with, uh, the, uh, the state, the state

729
02:45:34,170 --> 02:45:41,209
of Nevada versus Jeremy Albertson and the, uh, he talked about how Rick Sanchez and the doctor were

730
02:45:41,209 --> 02:45:53,379
essentially the same person being sued. It's so funny. I was just so inaccurate. That statement

731
02:45:53,379 --> 02:45:58,940
probably was that people, I probably had some people spit their drink out. What's my 2022

732
02:45:58,940 --> 02:46:15,239
yearly anime? That's a good question. What is my 2022 yearly anime? What do you guys think? Oh,

733
02:46:15,239 --> 02:46:21,000
you know what? No, I called it the Harry Potter for adults too. Didn't I? I made a lot of just

734
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:30,299
like, like, like just statements, huh? I would just full of shit this whole time. I'll say what

735
02:46:30,299 --> 02:46:33,659
I did see of doctor who I actually really, I thought was actually really good. I thought

736
02:46:33,659 --> 02:46:42,280
the episode was really good. It was the one with, uh, David, yeah, David, um, what's his name? David

737
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:46,979
Tennant. He was great. I've seen at least a few clips. I've seen, I've seen at least two or three

738
02:46:46,979 --> 02:47:03,739
episodes. Oh boys, people are gonna be mad about this, but I'm going to show it because I have to

739
02:47:03,739 --> 02:47:30,629
because I just, I have to. I don't know. I honestly don't even know the context of that image.

740
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:51,850
Some of you maybe get it. I don't get it. That's a line from the show. I thought, oh, I thought you

741
02:47:51,850 --> 02:47:59,500
were combining two things. I thought the, I'm doctor who in the, in this motherfucker. I thought

742
02:47:59,500 --> 02:48:03,979
that was you, there was a Rick Sanchez. You were combining two of them. Like, I'm doctor who in

743
02:48:03,979 --> 02:48:10,809
this motherfucker. Yeah, that's right. Me, Rick, doctor who. Yeah. I thought that's what you were

744
02:48:10,809 --> 02:48:19,500
doing. That's not what you were doing. Okay. That's a line that doctor who says, I'm very confused.

745
02:48:19,500 --> 02:48:28,280
I'm incredibly confused right now. Who, who says that? That's a line from the show. Rick says that

746
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:38,620
in one of the later seasons. Wait, he does? Wait, Rick says that in the show as a joke, like the joke

747
02:48:38,620 --> 02:49:01,639
of, oh, I don't watch either one of these shows guys. I don't. What? What? I don't know. Should I

748
02:49:01,639 --> 02:49:09,579
show these? I feel like I'm going to make everybody hate me. You fucked up so bad. I don't watch either

749
02:49:09,579 --> 02:49:15,420
of these shows. You could show me, you could gaslight me so bad on both these shows. In fact,

750
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:19,420
I think that's what happened. It's, I'm sorry. People have been just like gaslighting me this

751
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:24,459
whole time and I, they were telling me like what that doctor who was Rick and Morty. So I believed

752
02:49:24,459 --> 02:49:37,209
him. So that's what I made that comment about Spencer Gifts and everybody got mad. All right.

753
02:49:37,209 --> 02:49:42,420
All right. I get it. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I thought,

754
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:57,180
okay, I thought you made that up. Rick and Morty came out first. Oh my goodness. That person's,

755
02:49:57,979 --> 02:50:15,190
you need to turn off your DMs. This is supposed to be a stream where I played a game with as a

756
02:50:15,190 --> 02:50:19,739
bug and we've relaxed. So that's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do.

757
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:25,590
I, I apologize to all the doctor who fans and all the Rick and Morty fans and all the Harry Potter

758
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:33,100
fans. Sorry. I've been on a roll the last few weeks talking about everybody's favorite television

759
02:50:33,100 --> 02:50:40,889
shows and movies that I thought would, but I'd never seen them. Nevermind. You've ruined my life.

760
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:57,930
Okay. I need to find little things. I apologize. Let me ask you a question though.

761
02:50:57,930 --> 02:51:06,579
What I know that, okay, is there a show that if I, I feel like Rick and Morty has just,

762
02:51:06,579 --> 02:51:11,690
has a ton of people that like it, are big fans, but a ton of people that hate it.

763
02:51:11,690 --> 02:51:23,829
What's a show that has a bunch of people that just hate it? It's just, everybody doesn't like it.

764
02:51:23,829 --> 02:51:35,930
Is there one game of Thrones? All right. Game of Thrones is pretty close. Got it. That's a tough

765
02:51:35,930 --> 02:51:49,959
question. Oh my God. I'm feeling so terribly. Okay. I need, dude, big mouth, big mouth,

766
02:51:49,959 --> 02:51:57,579
the big bang theory. No, I don't, dude, big bang theory has a ton of fans. That show lasted

767
02:51:57,579 --> 02:52:14,809
almost 10 years. It had $600 trillion in revenue somehow. That show had a lot of fans. Okay.

768
02:52:14,809 --> 02:52:28,620
There's one here. All right. Seven more. Riverdale. Riverdale. People saying Riverdale. Young

769
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:41,290
Sheldon. Oh, my sister was a real cool character. Me and my trains and my brother and my father.

770
02:52:49,299 --> 02:53:01,299
That's how I know. Yup. Bingo. Bingo. There it is. Bingo. I knew it. I knew I could unite you all

771
02:53:01,299 --> 02:53:22,739
in your collective hatred of me. I knew I could unite everybody. All right. Six more.

772
02:53:22,739 --> 02:53:31,290
I was actually, me and Holly were talking about shows that we wanted to catch up with or watch.

773
02:53:32,010 --> 02:53:35,690
I haven't seen any of Better Call Saul after season two. I want to watch a lot of that.

774
02:53:37,510 --> 02:53:45,030
The boys season three is coming out, right? Which I don't know if I'm excited for it, but it's okay.

775
02:53:45,030 --> 02:53:55,700
I was, I thought it was all right. I kind of want to see what happens. Boy season two was boring.

776
02:53:55,700 --> 02:54:03,659
Yeah, that's, I mean, it was all right. It was just, season one was crazy. You want me to help

777
02:54:03,659 --> 02:54:18,600
you? I gotta help this guy. Can I not help you? Can't break it. Barry's pretty good.

778
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:38,040
Barry was pretty good. Press E. Better Call Saul is the best. Did I just eat him? Oh, I just ate him.

779
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:47,750
Have you watched any good documentaries lately? I fell asleep through Supersize Me 2,

780
02:54:47,750 --> 02:54:52,229
but that's not because the documentary wasn't bad or something. I just was really, really tired.

781
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:11,620
I love, you know what it is? YouTube has free movies where you just, they just ads,

782
02:55:11,620 --> 02:55:20,120
just ad-supported movies. And it's just a bunch of weird old shit. I'll just pick one of those

783
02:55:20,200 --> 02:55:37,420
and just watch it. You should watch The Expanse. Yeah, everyone's saying to watch The Expanse,

784
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:55,270
but isn't The Expanse just Rick and Morty for adults? I think I got them all over here.

785
02:55:55,270 --> 02:56:21,159
Did I go this way? I did not. That's a great show. That's a great bait. What a troll. Yeah,

786
02:56:22,090 --> 02:56:40,860
yeah, I know. The Expanse is actually Harry Potter for kids. Go fly. How come I'm not flying?

787
02:56:40,860 --> 02:56:55,059
This is being completely uninformed and just talking out my ass. There are people that,

788
02:56:55,059 --> 02:56:59,610
I know we talk about this and we fuck around, but there are probably people that have come to this

789
02:56:59,610 --> 02:57:03,129
stream and have heard me say like, dude, this guy just said Dr. Who was fucking Rick and Morty.

790
02:57:03,129 --> 02:57:12,940
I fucking hate this guy. I mean, that makes me sad in a way. This is going to be hard.

791
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:35,579
I got to hang. There we go. Okay. If you care enough about Dr. Who to get mad at that,

792
02:57:41,270 --> 02:57:59,299
I need to fucking focus. Let me focus. So where, what's safe? Maybe I should just grab one of these.

793
02:58:01,379 --> 02:58:36,659
Oh, yep. Got it. Oh yeah. All right. Only two more. Spot over here. The peak is over here.

794
02:58:36,659 --> 02:58:40,979
Only one more after this. Hopefully I didn't miss any. It'd be very unhappy if I did.

795
02:58:49,270 --> 02:59:10,659
19. One more. Toothstream? Oh, but what is a toothstream? Oh, you know what Holly brought

796
02:59:10,659 --> 02:59:18,659
up yesterday that I didn't even realize? The old Scooby-Doo had a laugh track. That's so weird.

797
02:59:18,659 --> 02:59:42,760
Cartoons had laugh tracks. Right here. Yes. I didn't miss any. Yeah, I did. Stop. I didn't

798
02:59:42,760 --> 03:00:01,540
notice. No. Yeah, it had celebrity guests too. Here comes my impatience. All right. Slow down.

799
03:00:01,540 --> 03:00:25,270
I'm a spider for God's sake. Like just, just do this. So much safer. Yeah. What are you doing?

800
03:00:25,270 --> 03:00:44,059
There we go. Go to the peak. Save. I'm not. No. Why do you want me to say that? You want to clip

801
03:00:44,059 --> 03:01:01,290
it so you can make me look like an idiot? Any more than 20? I know it's not an old idea,

802
03:01:01,290 --> 03:01:17,819
but having a random laugh track to show up during the stream. I think it's kind of funny.

803
03:01:17,819 --> 03:01:35,139
You already did that. Yeah, I know. Please save Bazinga. I got other people saying it.

804
03:01:35,139 --> 03:01:49,959
What do you mean I got? Why does that mean? Hey, dude, I got other people to say it.

805
03:01:49,959 --> 03:02:12,170
Oh, I move fast. I do. What am I doing? All right. I got to go to the peak. I've got 20.

806
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:42,899
Just wanted that last one. All right. Why does mates eat their heads? That's fucking weird.

807
03:02:42,899 --> 03:02:56,840
All right. Almost there. Come on. I was right there, dude. Come on, dude. Come on, bro.

808
03:02:56,840 --> 03:03:00,940
Praying mantis. I think a lot of bugs eat each other. Tons of bugs eat each other.

809
03:03:00,940 --> 03:03:16,200
It's over here. Oh, hey again. Glad to see you took me up on the pollen quest.

810
03:03:16,200 --> 03:03:21,370
Annabee's peak is just a bit further this way. Hope you don't. Hope you get the 20 we need.

811
03:03:21,370 --> 03:03:32,659
The queen is waiting. I got it. I'm on it. Ants eat other ants. Yeah, it's weird.

812
03:03:32,659 --> 03:03:42,090
God, ants are so weird. Bugs are so weird in general. I could tell you before.

813
03:03:43,209 --> 03:03:50,489
Ants are just a math problem. Ants are math. The weird coordination. They're just a calculation.

814
03:03:51,420 --> 03:04:09,879
Ants are math. They're almost a simple AI. It's really interesting. Reused bit.

815
03:04:09,879 --> 03:04:14,500
Well, it's not reused because last time I did this bit, I think there were four or five

816
03:04:14,500 --> 03:04:21,270
thousand people here. Now there's 50,000 in current viewers. My goodness. Thanks, guys.

817
03:04:21,270 --> 03:04:37,500
Welcome to the stream. All right. We're almost there. Yeah. Just wait. Just wait for the

818
03:04:37,500 --> 03:04:41,670
course it was got video where they're going to talk about bugs. Ants are math.

819
03:04:41,670 --> 03:05:06,250
They're just a just a basic math problem. Whoa. This is cool. Look, it's the little spider.

820
03:05:06,250 --> 03:05:10,889
Heard you've been helping out with the pollen quest. You got your 20 grains. Go on in.

821
03:05:10,889 --> 03:05:24,520
Queen awaits. What does this get me? A new hat? Okay. 13.5 Andy.

822
03:05:26,680 --> 03:05:31,579
All right. I heard so much about you. Have you brought the pollen for the princess royal jelly?

823
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:37,500
Yes, this shall make a powerful jelly. The new princess will be magnificent.

824
03:05:37,500 --> 03:05:41,180
Wait here a moment while we prepare her. I'm sure she would love to meet you.

825
03:05:41,819 --> 03:05:53,500
What do I actually get for doing this? Behold, your princess has arrived.

826
03:05:54,680 --> 03:06:03,270
You're so beautiful. Such powerful wings. Thank you all for your hard labor preparing my royal jelly.

827
03:06:03,270 --> 03:06:07,190
Dear spider, my mother told me of your predicament as I lay in my cell.

828
03:06:07,989 --> 03:06:13,030
You're planning a rescue mission to a magic island in the sky. I can think of no greater

829
03:06:13,030 --> 03:06:17,909
adventure with which to stretch my new wings. Come with me. I will take you home and help prepare

830
03:06:17,909 --> 03:06:53,799
our voyage. Just eating my head. Nice hat. Thanks. We're going a long way. Okay. So what

831
03:06:54,360 --> 03:07:11,590
what else do I need? Where the hell am I? Oh, here we are. All right. Did I get anything new?

832
03:07:12,229 --> 03:07:17,750
Here's the rest of our free flight checklist. Talk to the princess about sealing up the balloon.

833
03:07:17,750 --> 03:07:30,940
Okay. I need fuel. Okay. So I need fuel. Is the princess fixing this? Oh, there you are.

834
03:07:30,940 --> 03:07:34,540
This is the balloon that's supposed to take us to the magic island in the sky.

835
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:46,860
It'll never make it in this condition. Let me fix that up for you. Prove this is your real hair.

836
03:07:49,319 --> 03:08:01,000
See? This is real hair. But, uh, we shouldn't have any problems now. These wax patches are

837
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:09,319
completely airtight. All right. Cool. So now I need to have any fuel for the west.

838
03:08:09,959 --> 03:08:18,659
So I need to go this way. Dung beetles, right? Cool. I saw the, I saw it. What do you mean?

839
03:08:18,659 --> 03:08:29,190
I don't know what I was trying to do with that. Like I was trying to make it look like I had a

840
03:08:29,190 --> 03:08:42,250
bald cap on or something. I don't know what that was. Weird. Okay. I want to go up this way.

841
03:08:42,250 --> 03:08:48,739
Yeah. I was just moving my head back and forth. What the fuck was that? All right. This way.

842
03:08:50,780 --> 03:09:28,440
This game's cute. This is a cute game. So go get fuel from the dung beetles. Huh? Did I miss my,

843
03:09:28,440 --> 03:09:43,139
why am I back at this tutorial? Wrap around? Cause I need to go. Is there like a log to go

844
03:09:43,139 --> 03:10:13,700
through or something? How do I get over there? Is there a log here? Um, how do I get over there?

845
03:10:13,700 --> 03:11:07,399
I can't go over there. Maybe down into the left. There's a hole under the log. No help. You put

846
03:11:07,399 --> 03:11:29,500
chicken fat in your hair. Down here? This is definitely it. Oh yeah. All right. Looking for

847
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:50,329
fuel for the hot air balloon. Oh shit. The speed run for this game is probably insane.

848
03:11:50,329 --> 03:12:13,290
It probably is. Well, hold on. I, I can't breathe under there. Okay. So what am I looking for?

849
03:12:13,290 --> 03:12:49,110
I can't grab onto any of this. So I got to move the rocks. Follow me. Here we go. I kind of,

850
03:12:49,110 --> 03:12:59,079
I wonder how long, what's the speed run? Anybody know? What's the actual speed run? I can't get

851
03:12:59,079 --> 03:13:44,120
up there. I can grab this. 16 minutes. Jesus. 16 minutes. That's so fast. I spent 16 minutes

852
03:13:44,120 --> 03:14:06,329
stalling the start of my stream. Can't imagine completing this whole game in 16 minutes.

853
03:14:06,329 --> 03:14:15,530
This level is cool because it's kind of just a lot of swinging. Swinging is fun. I feel like

854
03:14:15,530 --> 03:14:20,579
there's such crazy tech with that too. With just the boom, boom, boom, boom. Make a thing to climb

855
03:14:20,579 --> 03:14:42,629
on like that. And he's still moving. That's so cool. It takes my brain five seconds to go. I

856
03:14:42,629 --> 03:15:14,260
can go there and there. There we go. There we go. Fluid. Fluid. Oh, be careful. I'm going in deep

857
03:15:14,260 --> 03:15:30,979
here. How far up do I have to go? Oops. Oh, I have to launch this. I, yep. I think maybe eventually.

858
03:15:30,979 --> 03:15:46,620
Okay. Let's try it. My eyes are so watery. Have I blinked in an hour? I think I'm in trouble here.

859
03:15:46,620 --> 03:16:28,219
Wait, what's down here? Hmm. Can I pull this? I wonder what I'm supposed to do here. What do I do?

860
03:16:28,219 --> 03:17:27,780
Oh, there we go. Kind of. Kind of. Yeah. Oh, get a launch. Launch. Launch. Swing. Up. Swing. Launch.

861
03:17:27,780 --> 03:17:58,010
Launch. Swing. Launch. Ah! Swing and launch. There it is. Swing. Up. Launch. Okay. I'm getting

862
03:17:58,010 --> 03:18:24,709
there. All right. Don't mess this up. Warning. Landslides. Bunker. Bunker. Oh my God. That scared

863
03:18:24,709 --> 03:18:48,459
the shit out of me. Okay. What is that? Those are eggs. I don't know where I'm going. I'm just

864
03:18:48,459 --> 03:18:58,870
sliding around. Mr. Sark is here. Oh, Mr. Sark is here. What's up, Sark? Hope you're doing well.

865
03:18:58,870 --> 03:19:08,809
Mr. Sark is, I would say, one of the original funniest internet people in around a long time.

866
03:19:08,809 --> 03:19:17,159
Maybe a lot of you don't know who Mr. Sark is. Oh, I would fix that immediately. Whoa. Hey there,

867
03:19:17,159 --> 03:19:30,170
friend. Welcome to dung town. How do I get dung? Pushing a great big ball of dung is one of the

868
03:19:30,170 --> 03:19:43,370
best workouts. Where do I get it? Fresh dung is the best dung. Where do I get it? What kind of dung

869
03:19:43,370 --> 03:19:55,219
is it? Like cow shit? What do they use? You want some? You're in luck. We've got some friends with

870
03:19:55,219 --> 03:20:01,059
loads of dung to share. It's not here. It's up the hill a fair way and there's one small problem

871
03:20:01,059 --> 03:20:07,700
with getting up there. To the point. Look, we need to get across these puddles and I broke my wing

872
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:14,020
a while back. No flying means we're in need of a walking-based solution. I think you could use

873
03:20:14,020 --> 03:20:18,600
your fancy web skills to string us a bridge out of them sticks. Help the beetles cross the puddles.

874
03:20:18,600 --> 03:20:37,930
Okay. Done. Easy. Go. I got it. What do you guys want? I don't understand what they want.

875
03:20:44,780 --> 03:21:05,270
They want a bridge? But how? I don't get it. I actually don't get it. They want me to make a

876
03:21:05,270 --> 03:21:12,200
bridge but they can't walk a thing like this? Like just a basic little bridge? I don't understand.

877
03:21:16,090 --> 03:21:25,399
Or do you mean pull these out of the water, make a bridge and then set these on top of the web?

878
03:21:52,969 --> 03:21:58,979
No. You move out of the fucking way. You're just crowding me. Get out of the way. Stop the other.

879
03:21:58,979 --> 03:22:07,530
What are you talking about? Wait, wait. I'm putting that, right? But then the log has to

880
03:22:07,530 --> 03:22:15,110
go on top of those. On top of that. That's how this works. That's the only way it can work,

881
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:30,010
right? He's pretending. I can't make a bridge with two sticks. There's not enough. I need more

882
03:22:30,010 --> 03:22:39,780
sticks. I need like 10 of these. How many? What? Look at that guy. How am I going to walk across

883
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:47,540
this? Look, these guys are so huge. The third log. How are they going to get across this one?

884
03:22:48,020 --> 03:23:12,549
They're going to be stranded. Now what? He's almost. They said make us a nice bridge with your web.

885
03:23:12,549 --> 03:23:19,270
All right, bros. Step on it. Go. Step on it then. What do you want me to do?

886
03:23:21,299 --> 03:23:41,129
Hey, you fixed the bridge. Go. Yeah. Go ahead. You fucking idiots. That was not, that was,

887
03:23:41,850 --> 03:23:45,959
that was fucked up. Yeah, please. That was fucked up.

888
03:23:48,040 --> 03:23:54,540
That was fucked up. That was just like, he just mushed over all that.

889
03:23:54,540 --> 03:24:09,459
I'm not soft-locked. Why are you being so toxic? I'm not being toxic. I'm being realistic. This

890
03:24:09,459 --> 03:24:26,280
is, this is not toxic to say, dude, what are you? Go up. I need to move this big one over there now,

891
03:24:26,280 --> 03:24:32,219
right? Because they're not going to go over there unless it's there. Is there one over the other

892
03:24:32,219 --> 03:25:40,500
side? Stop yelling at them. Can I go under? I thought I was going to have to do that iPad game

893
03:25:40,500 --> 03:25:44,549
where you make the whole bridge with the web. I thought I was going to have to do shit like this.

894
03:25:44,549 --> 03:25:57,139
You know what I mean? Like connect the, make a bridge with the web and relax. You just relax.

895
03:25:57,139 --> 03:26:07,000
Yes, bridge constructor. That's what I thought I was going to have to do. Okay. Go ahead and

896
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:20,250
cross it. What kind of bullshit is this? What? Just, just float. Just float. You know what, dude?

897
03:26:20,250 --> 03:26:38,870
Just go. I promise you. Go. Why won't you go? Why won't he go? Give it a go. Yep. Go. You're,

898
03:26:38,950 --> 03:26:57,799
he's there, right? Why won't, I don't, why wouldn't he go? All right, go ahead.

899
03:27:24,100 --> 03:27:25,459
Tell him Wendy and Michael sent you.

900
03:27:28,500 --> 03:27:30,579
Tell the Beatles and I got some dung.

901
03:27:32,659 --> 03:27:40,489
Very nice. All right. So now I've got dung. I have fuel. Am I ready to go? What else is left?

902
03:27:40,489 --> 03:27:49,500
You did that in the worst possible way. It's all right. It says to get done.

903
03:27:51,979 --> 03:27:59,340
Ask yourself a question. Did the dung beetle get across the lake unharmed? That was the goal.

904
03:28:00,059 --> 03:28:11,209
Yes. Does it matter how? Does it matter that the goal happened? Dung beetle gets across the

905
03:28:12,010 --> 03:28:29,940
body of water completely unharmed. That's it. Was there like a dung beetle king or queen or

906
03:28:29,940 --> 03:28:56,010
something? Cause I'm going all the way up. Look at this. What else is up here? It's kind of cool.

907
03:28:56,010 --> 03:29:22,920
I don't care. What have I scaled the whole dung mountain? Is there a reliable fast way to get

908
03:29:22,920 --> 03:30:01,620
back by the way? No secret. Come on. What is all the way over here? Oh Jesus. Hold on. Hey.

909
03:30:06,260 --> 03:30:16,139
I don't actually, I'm not going to go to the whole thing, right? There's more to do

910
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:23,639
all the way up. Can you do a twerk stream? I don't think I would have to do a whole stream for that,

911
03:30:23,639 --> 03:30:45,059
man. I think I just do that in five seconds. I think I have to weigh this down. No, don't.

912
03:30:45,059 --> 03:31:14,059
Come here. I definitely have to put weight on this, right? What does this do? Okay. Oh,

913
03:31:14,059 --> 03:31:35,700
all right. All the way, all the way. I wonder. Whoa. Hold on now. Don't go anywhere. What's the

914
03:31:35,700 --> 03:31:58,600
point of that? I don't see anything here. What's the point of that? He probably could twerk if

915
03:31:58,600 --> 03:32:03,799
he tried. It's going to take a hundred million dollars for me to twerk on stream. That's right.

916
03:32:03,799 --> 03:33:07,860
There you go. Most of the peak you already did. What the fuck is this? How come I can't show this?

917
03:33:07,860 --> 03:33:31,049
I can't like save that. Oh, here we go. Try this one. This isn't twerking though. It is twerking.

918
03:33:31,049 --> 03:33:59,479
What? That was like a twerk. Yeah. Why does it sound like this is times? What speed is this?

919
03:33:59,479 --> 03:34:19,239
It is slowed down. Hey, can you twerk? Yeah. That's fine. Whatever. I don't care. Being a handful of

920
03:34:20,600 --> 03:34:23,719
beans. He admits it. He needs a glove. What the hell is he doing?

921
03:34:24,760 --> 03:34:45,059
All right. I'm getting to the top of dung mountain. I know it's getting late. I feel like I'm pretty

922
03:34:45,059 --> 03:34:51,639
close to the end of the game though. Yeah. Impromptu like 7 PM Pacific stream. And I do apologize for

923
03:34:51,639 --> 03:34:57,340
that. Don't know why I'm not streaming tomorrow. And I decided to stream right now at 7 PM,

924
03:34:57,340 --> 03:35:03,450
four hours ago or so, because I have to take Otto to the vet tomorrow. I'm going to get him checked

925
03:35:03,450 --> 03:35:09,850
out. Just a couple of things. I want to make sure that he's good to go and I want to get him in.

926
03:35:09,850 --> 03:35:17,299
So I'm going to be doing that tomorrow. We're doing house flipper pet DLC on Saturday and then Sunday

927
03:35:17,299 --> 03:35:23,780
we're doing blood wash and the other horror game murder house. Or we might do that on Saturday and

928
03:35:23,780 --> 03:35:30,760
then do pets on Sunday. Depends on how I feel. Keep us updated. Oh, I will. He's fine. Don't worry.

929
03:35:30,760 --> 03:35:37,139
He's fine. I would tell you if I was actually concerned and I am not. So he's completely fine.

930
03:35:39,690 --> 03:35:49,079
Yeah. Sorry. It's we started late and are going late. Still going here. I hope there's a fast

931
03:35:49,079 --> 03:36:35,290
way to get back because I'm going across the whole damn game right now. God slow down. I just thought

932
03:36:35,290 --> 03:36:38,569
of this picture again and it's like making me laugh. I just thought of this picture.

933
03:36:38,889 --> 03:36:56,020
It's just flashed in my brain and I had to look at it again. I need to get to the top of Dung

934
03:36:56,020 --> 03:37:20,659
Mountain even if it's a stupid just achievement or something. All right. Here we go. I made it.

935
03:37:20,659 --> 03:37:29,940
Howdy, spider. Wendy and Mike sent you, did they? You must be here for the bounty of dung.

936
03:37:30,500 --> 03:37:35,139
We got some for you right on over here. My problem is this dung is a little too comforting.

937
03:37:35,860 --> 03:37:41,459
Our lazy son is simply refusing to leave the ball. It's so hot out there. Why would I want to leave?

938
03:37:42,420 --> 03:37:46,180
Spider, it's all yours if you can convince him to get out and see a bit of the world.

939
03:37:47,059 --> 03:38:18,120
Give it a little push. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. So this is the fast way to get back.

940
03:38:18,760 --> 03:38:35,959
That makes sense. Hang on. They make it. Nice. I got the fuel. You're going to kill him. He's

941
03:38:35,959 --> 03:38:49,030
fine. It's padding. Did I seriously just get kicked out of my home? I'll just have to live

942
03:38:49,110 --> 03:38:57,530
here now, I guess. Help yourself to some dung. It's my favorite. Very energy dense. Okay. How

943
03:38:57,530 --> 03:39:14,229
much do I need? How many balls of dung do I need? Can you come grab this? Oh, it's coming all the

944
03:39:14,229 --> 03:39:20,889
way down. All right. How many balls should I do? One or two? I'll try. I'll try to grab one. No.

945
03:39:21,530 --> 03:40:03,780
All right. Send it up. No. Okay. Now you just fuck with me. Get up there. Dung. Here we go.

946
03:40:03,780 --> 03:40:43,739
Where do I need to put it? Okay. Am I ready to go? Okay. Now the dung is to go in underneath

947
03:40:43,739 --> 03:41:11,370
there, right? Grab the dung. Dung in the cup. That's what I'm trying to do. Okay. Here's the

948
03:41:11,370 --> 03:41:17,299
rest of the checklist. Attach engine immediately below the mouth of the balloon. Burn the secret

949
03:41:17,299 --> 03:41:29,110
pilot platform to balloon. Just follow the blueprints. Fuel in the engine. Engine up into

950
03:41:29,110 --> 03:41:34,950
here. It's patched up. Spider web this all. I'm ready to go. Okay. Now we stick this in here.

951
03:41:35,670 --> 03:42:36,809
That's good. So now I have to attach this. Let's click in there already. Click in there. Why is

952
03:42:36,809 --> 03:42:58,409
it not clicking in there? Come on. Do like a... It doesn't click in. Oh, well it's in. All right.

953
03:42:58,409 --> 03:43:32,969
It's in. Now I need webs. I'm ready to fly. Are you ready to head out? Okay. So I got that done. I

954
03:43:32,969 --> 03:43:56,979
need to go turn in the bugs. Why did it fall? This doesn't look safe. Retach it. Turn up the music

955
03:43:56,979 --> 03:44:22,040
for the finale. Okay. We did it. Engine normal. Airspeed increasing. This is it. We're flying.

956
03:44:22,040 --> 03:44:50,809
Engine nominal. Airspeed increasing. This is it. We're flying. What if I cut the strings? You can't.

957
03:44:50,809 --> 03:45:06,059
Oh, dude. Fuck it. Let's get the skateboard out. No, not the board, bro. The ship is holding on

958
03:45:06,059 --> 03:46:12,520
barely. I got it. We're fine. Mayday? What the fuck is that? I don't know. These are like asteroids.

959
03:46:12,520 --> 03:46:20,180
It's gems. How do I collect the gems? Well, this storm was not on the forecast. The ship is still

960
03:46:20,180 --> 03:46:33,190
holding out. The wind is really picking up now. I feel so alive. Uh-oh. Stay safe. We'll keep the

961
03:46:33,190 --> 03:46:56,329
engine running for you. It was all fucked up. I had to fix it. This is it. The Sky Bower. The

962
03:46:56,329 --> 03:47:00,170
airship won't be able to make it any further in the storm. You'll have to continue without us.

963
03:47:00,170 --> 03:47:12,420
Go find your love. We'll meet you on the other side. This is the crow place. He says uh-oh,

964
03:47:12,420 --> 03:47:37,030
like a toddler who shit his pants. Uh-oh. Oh, no. Up in the sky area. This is kind of loud.

965
03:47:37,590 --> 03:48:33,930
Do I have to take this with me or something? Where do I go? Is that break? Um, what? Oh, okay.

966
03:48:33,930 --> 03:48:43,190
All right. I get it. Yeah, this is gonna be a pain in the ass, isn't it? A little, a little loud

967
03:48:43,190 --> 03:49:21,500
for me. Nothing down there. All right. Let's just go here. I'm here. Where is it? Up there. Shit.

968
03:49:21,500 --> 03:50:45,670
Get over here. We're good. Oh, shit. Oh, will you please? Come on. Oh, my God. Boy. Okay. All

969
03:50:45,670 --> 03:50:57,000
right. I made it. I got it. I got it. I need the ball. Where's the ball? Where's the ball?

970
03:50:57,959 --> 03:51:24,520
Where's the ball? I left the ball. Are you kidding me? Where? I didn't leave the ball.

971
03:51:25,079 --> 03:52:45,989
Where's the ball? Am I soft-locked? Huh? Holy shit. That was 100 IQ. Yes. Okay. Let me take a look.

972
03:52:45,989 --> 03:53:20,260
What's over here? A lot of bullshit. Where are you going? Go in. Go in. Go in. I'm almost there.

973
03:53:20,260 --> 03:53:53,399
There's gonna be two, isn't there? Oh, God. Where is it? Okay. There's one here. All right.

974
03:53:53,399 --> 03:54:16,760
Just go underneath. I don't need to. Should be fine. Come with me. There it is. Thank you.

975
03:54:28,379 --> 03:54:43,979
And open the door. Not bad. I made it. Do I have to fight the crow? I don't want to really fight.

976
03:54:43,979 --> 03:55:35,979
I like crows. And oh, shit. Escape the skybower with your boyfriend. I found you. Can we get out

977
03:55:35,979 --> 03:55:49,370
of here? All right. Come with me. We got to go. We got to go now. Come on. We got to go now.

978
03:55:50,840 --> 03:56:27,379
We got to go now. We got to go now. Oh, okay. You got any of those gems anywhere? I need a gem.

979
03:56:27,379 --> 03:56:55,540
Is your head made out of gems? What? Oh, I think I saw the crow. Can you get up here?

980
03:56:55,540 --> 03:57:05,000
Nope. I got you. I got you. Watch out. Okay. You're good.

981
03:57:12,979 --> 03:57:43,260
You make it. Come on. Holding Q is kind of hard in doing W-A-S-T. What's wrong? Get over here, you

982
03:57:43,819 --> 03:58:06,219
dummy. What the? You settle the fuck down. Like, honestly, God, settle the fuck down. Really?

983
03:58:06,219 --> 03:58:14,059
That was so outrageous. That was so over the top. That was fucking horrible for me. I don't know

984
03:58:14,059 --> 03:58:21,209
why. Why is that so bad? That wasn't even a tuber reaction. That was like, I just, I really did not

985
03:58:21,209 --> 03:58:30,899
think that was going to happen for any reason. That was so bad. Why did I get scared so bad?

986
03:58:30,899 --> 03:58:51,989
It was the music too. Yo, you scared my bird. Oh, let's hear what they have to say. Oh, wow.

987
03:58:51,989 --> 03:59:09,930
A lot to say that bird. Wow. One of my mods is saying when you screamed, that made my discord

988
03:59:09,930 --> 03:59:21,579
lag for some reason. Will you get up here? We could have already been through the stupid

989
03:59:21,579 --> 04:00:02,549
jump scare part. Follow me. Just get bird boy technique. You know what? I'm done. I don't think

990
04:00:02,549 --> 04:00:26,899
this does anything. Whoa. Shit. Wait. Can you go through spider silk? Yeah. Right down here.

991
04:00:26,899 --> 04:01:22,579
Get down here, quick. Rush his face. Aha. Good. Hurry before he sees us. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry,

992
04:01:22,579 --> 04:02:00,120
hurry. Before he sees us. Oh my God. Damn it. That was, this thing's scary. Where'd he go?

993
04:02:00,120 --> 04:02:03,719
Oh my God. Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back. I thought that was, I didn't

994
04:02:03,719 --> 04:02:15,020
think it was a wall. Oh, good thing I, I, I got his mouth. I got his mouth sucked, sucked, sewed,

995
04:02:15,020 --> 04:02:55,860
got whatever. No, come on. I don't know what I need to attach it to. We go now. You fucking

996
04:02:55,860 --> 04:03:36,889
kidding me? I can't. Get over here. Out of sight, out of sight, out of sight, out of sight. I don't

997
04:03:36,889 --> 04:04:29,510
know where he is. Yeah. I knew he's going to be like right here. God. Bro, let's press the button,

998
04:04:29,510 --> 04:05:24,170
man. What the hell are you doing? Can you hold this? What do I do? I'm afraid to go up here.

999
04:05:24,170 --> 04:06:19,219
See? That's terrifying. Oh, that was right there. Shit. Just clear everything. Clear the whole

1000
04:06:19,219 --> 04:06:34,250
fucking thing. Essentially what I wanted. All right, now pull that down. Don't kill me. What?

1001
04:06:35,049 --> 04:07:22,020
Why did it not land on the web? Click. Hurry up. Wait, don't go fast. He's going to be right here,

1002
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:48,620
isn't he? Hey, back up. Good. Little Spider, you made it and you've rescued your boyfriend.

1003
04:07:49,420 --> 04:07:54,889
We're almost ready to go home. Vlad is just bringing the airship around now. Wait, he's

1004
04:07:54,969 --> 04:08:12,280
coming. Watch out. What? Hold on, Little Spider. We're going to catch this bird.

1005
04:08:13,559 --> 04:09:03,620
Defeat the bird. Help, help, help, help. Whoa. Whoa. He's fucking dead. Sorry we're late. Just

1006
04:09:03,620 --> 04:09:10,659
picked up a little help on the way. Hey, neighbor. MechAnt1 reporting for duty. This beast doesn't

1007
04:09:10,659 --> 04:09:17,290
stand a chance. Coming in close now. I'm already dead. I hit the ground already. Let's do this.

1008
04:09:17,930 --> 04:09:32,889
What do you want me to do? I didn't read that. I didn't read that. What did I have to do? I

1009
04:09:32,889 --> 04:10:25,780
didn't read it. I'm in position. Get clear. Attaching MechAnt1. We're going to fight his

1010
04:10:25,780 --> 04:10:47,290
head off. Okay, we did it. Now we can let go. We did it. The beast is grounded. What should we do

1011
04:10:47,290 --> 04:10:54,889
with him now, comrade? We send him away. You hear me, bird? You burnt all your bridges here.

1012
04:10:55,850 --> 04:10:59,530
The bugs of this bush will not put up with you eating and kidnapping their friends.

1013
04:11:00,899 --> 04:11:05,379
Now we have the means to defend ourselves. We need to find a new land to call home.

1014
04:11:06,020 --> 04:11:11,559
Maybe somewhere far away from here with more birds like you. Maybe somewhere you can finally

1015
04:11:11,559 --> 04:11:29,459
find a friend. But you leave now or I change my mind. Oh my, that was scary. I wasn't sure I'd

1016
04:11:29,459 --> 04:11:35,059
be able to talk to him, but I did it. Thank you, buddy. Thank you too, buddy's boyfriend.

1017
04:11:35,059 --> 04:11:40,100
Your brave actions gave me the courage to finally send up to that menace. Home is a little bit safer

1018
04:11:40,100 --> 04:11:57,879
today thanks to you. I did it. That was fun. Nice job. That was fun. All right, but wait,

1019
04:11:57,879 --> 04:12:24,940
this is the post-season credits. He doesn't know. I wish this game had music. I turned it down, man.

1020
04:12:25,579 --> 04:12:45,059
We should watch the speed run. What's the, uh, one of the mods link, uh, the world record? I'm

1021
04:12:45,059 --> 04:12:53,610
curious. I'm the second place runner as of a few days ago. Rip. Oh, wow. That's still pretty,

1022
04:12:53,610 --> 04:13:05,079
that's still awesome though. I mean, that's still, it's ridiculous. World record 1631. Is it any

1023
04:13:05,079 --> 04:13:12,600
percent or do you, uh, just any percent? Well, hold on. This is cute. And you as buddy the spider.

1024
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:35,579
How come that bird's so nice? Why was the crow so mean? Why was the marshmallow one so nice? Oh,

1025
04:13:35,579 --> 04:13:57,959
hold on. Baby? Baby? Is that a baby spider? What is it? A baby? Oh, it's babies. A lot of babies.

1026
04:14:01,860 --> 04:14:31,780
Where do we go now? Very cool. What's through here? Is it just free roam now? It's probably

1027
04:14:31,780 --> 04:15:02,299
just free roam. Oh, hold on. So do you get a, what do I get for this? Give me a hat.

1028
04:15:04,709 --> 04:15:13,459
Yeah. Let me put the speed run on. I'm very curious about this. It's just, I have to watch

1029
04:15:13,459 --> 04:15:43,180
the whole thing. We do not have to watch the whole thing. It's only 16 minutes. Hold on. Let's get

1030
04:15:43,180 --> 04:16:24,260
it. Let's get a good view. So you, you use propulsion. What the fuck? What? You just throw

1031
04:16:24,260 --> 04:16:43,940
yourself down and you use the laser for propulsion. I can't even tell what's happening. Wow. This is

1032
04:16:43,940 --> 04:16:49,100
really a pretty, I would say this is probably a pretty good speed running game, right? There's

1033
04:16:49,100 --> 04:16:57,000
not a whole lot of, it's a lot of just go get that thing and put it over here. Do you even

1034
04:16:57,000 --> 04:17:02,549
have to help anybody? Actually, to get the, I think you have to. To get the, to get the

1035
04:17:03,350 --> 04:17:10,059
heart rate balloon, right? The whole lot. Does, does the movement speed stack? Does it have a

1036
04:17:10,059 --> 04:17:23,450
cap? Or can you just actually fly and throw yourself around? Oh, look at that. About getting a good

1037
04:17:23,450 --> 04:17:29,940
angle in the central mechanic. Yeah. This is definitely a speed running game. What the hell

1038
04:17:29,940 --> 04:17:52,840
was that? What? This is an actual spider. Yeah. This really is an actual spider. I'm curious about

1039
04:17:52,840 --> 04:18:11,850
the, that. Wow. That was close. That's so cool. All right. What about, I want to see up here.

1040
04:18:11,850 --> 04:18:34,629
Put on break core. I want to see one of these down. I want to see what happens at the end here.

1041
04:18:34,629 --> 04:18:57,530
So you just, you just, you just drag. Dude, what? How are you even supposed to do that?

1042
04:18:57,530 --> 04:19:17,610
All right. That was pretty cool. All right. Here comes the fight with the bird. How do you do this

1043
04:19:17,610 --> 04:19:49,000
fast? Oh, you guys can't even hear it. What? Wait, what, what just happened? Don't you have to web

1044
04:19:49,000 --> 04:20:06,819
the bird? It's a skip. Wow. Well, there it is. Well, congratulations. This is your world record.

1045
04:20:06,819 --> 04:20:19,909
That's really cool. That's so cool. This game's got some bugs in it. Time that person up for an

1046
04:20:19,909 --> 04:20:35,829
hour. Yeah. Link to the speed run. Yeah. We'll link the speed run. Here is a link to the world record.

1047
04:20:35,829 --> 04:20:44,809
If you'd like to take a look. The video that was just on screen. That's really cool. All right. I

1048
04:20:44,809 --> 04:20:57,110
think that's it. We get a baseball update. July 14th. July 14th. Mark it on your calendar.

1049
04:20:57,110 --> 04:21:05,770
Baseball is going to be July 14th. Yeah. I don't want to go too, too late. Impromptu stream here.

1050
04:21:05,770 --> 04:21:10,090
Supposed to be streaming tomorrow, but schedule getting changed. I got to take care of Otto.

1051
04:21:10,090 --> 04:21:17,579
So we'll see you later. We'll see you again. I will see you guys on Saturday. We'll do Saturday,

1052
04:21:17,579 --> 04:21:23,719
Sunday. And we're going to, we'll go a little longer. The last two days in a row have been

1053
04:21:23,719 --> 04:21:31,639
four hour, four and a half hour here. I'd like to stream for at least five to seven hours. So we

1054
04:21:31,639 --> 04:21:46,379
will do some long ones this weekend. Four hour Andy. That was a cute game. I like that a lot.

1055
04:21:46,379 --> 04:21:52,700
That was requested for a while too. That's fun. Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry to every sci-fi fantasy

1056
04:21:53,739 --> 04:21:58,250
fan of any show ever. I feel like you lost a little bit of respect for me tonight.

1057
04:21:58,250 --> 04:22:12,500
Very sorry. I want to profusely apologize. Very sorry about that. We have a lot of fun here,

1058
04:22:12,500 --> 04:22:21,670
don't we? Show the image again. This is the one that I still have. It queued up. I really thought

1059
04:22:21,670 --> 04:22:26,579
that you mashed these two together. I don't know. I haven't seen like really much of either.

1060
04:22:27,379 --> 04:22:38,299
I mean, I've seen Rick and Morty. All right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching.

1061
04:22:38,299 --> 04:22:44,840
See you soon. See you Saturday. I will give you an auto update. He's going to be fine.

1062
04:22:44,840 --> 04:22:48,549
I just want to check him out for a couple of things. Things that are

1063
04:22:49,270 --> 04:22:52,790
at least concerning enough for me to want him to go to the vet. So, but he's fine.

1064
04:22:52,790 --> 04:23:19,270
I'll give you an update. Good luck, Otto. Yeah. Good luck, Otto. Otto. Thanks for the subs.

1065
04:23:19,270 --> 04:23:26,010
Thanks for the bits. A lot of subs were coming in today. A lot of community subs.

1066
04:23:26,010 --> 04:23:38,979
That was a good, yeah, it was just fun. I really like these experiences. Games that are between

1067
04:23:38,979 --> 04:23:49,639
three and five hours. They're almost perfect. I love these little bite size experiences.

1068
04:23:49,639 --> 04:24:20,379
Hope you had fun. I did. Small experiences for a small man. I'm very, I'm actually kind of nervous

1069
04:24:20,379 --> 04:24:23,420
for Dextreme because it's going to be a brand new audio setup, but I'm going to sound completely

1070
04:24:23,420 --> 04:24:31,430
different. You guys are going to have to give me some feedback. I need to know how it sounds,

1071
04:24:31,430 --> 04:24:42,360
good or bad. What's the schedule? Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific is the next live stream on this

1072
04:24:42,360 --> 04:25:15,299
channel. Get some sleep. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother, you know, as usual. He said

1073
04:25:15,299 --> 04:25:30,149
that like four streams in a row now. Yeah, Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific. Good night. Take care of

1074
04:25:30,149 --> 04:25:32,379
yourselves and goodbye.
