1
00:00:47,740 --> 00:01:22,569

Welcome, happy, no, not yet, not yet, not yet, but hello everybody, welcome to a grand, grand, hold on, let me make sure it doesn't play again, hold on, oh shit, it's starting again, it's starting again, hold on, hi guys, welcome to a very special, let's just go ahead and get the feet up on the, don't, hold on, I can't fuck, this, I just got done setting this all up, I don't wanna fuck it up, uh, welcome to the New Year's Eve, uh, spectacular,

2
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:54,409
if you can even call it that, this is, uh, this is a lot of work in the making, in two days, we had this idea like two or three days ago, and a shitload of people in the community are to be thanked for getting this to be a possibility, so, thank you to especially the mods, all of you, you took a, the nomination process, there were spreadsheets involved, it was kind of insane, uh, holy mack and effectator, holy shit,

3
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:27,979
you guys, uh, you guys knocked it out of the park, we were, all three of us were like trying to get these like videos done, and oh my goodness gracious, uh, but, it, it, I think it's all ready to go, and I just figured this out right now that I'm here, so, welcome to New Year's Eve, as you see here, got a lot of cards here, these are all categories that some of you guys may have voted on, or maybe you didn't, but you did, uh, we got worst new character is the first one, slow mode off,

4
00:02:27,979 --> 00:03:05,819
it's New Year's Eve, all the awards will be given, top bananas, and yes, I'm very much aware that there are only eight bananas here, there are like 17 awards, I promise I didn't burn the other ones, but I got, hold on, there might be another couple of top, is my fly up today, yeah it is, wait a second, there is the most coveted award in the entire world,

5
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:34,340
it's the worst stream of the year, tiny Oscar, somebody's gonna be getting this tonight, take a look at that, six inches tall, the real one's only like seven, so who cares, that's gonna go right in the front, does it look good, no, this needs to go like higher up, can I balance these on the bananas,

6
00:03:34,340 --> 00:04:18,629
Jeremy, you're not good at anything, I just have to touch it for a second and it's fine, so, uh, thank you for, this is my leg of that, this is such a wobbly fucking table, I don't even have, by the way, there are no notifications tonight, because I'm on location, so, I don't have access to any real dashboard stuff or stream labs, I figured we just would kind of just axe it for tonight anyways,

7
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:55,339
I do have my Twitch dashboard though, which is a good thing, and yes, I am stalling because, this is like the first break I've had, I'm serious, this is like, first time I've just been able to sit down and do nothing, for like three days, it's an award show, this is what they do, the guy comes out on stage and he like has a nice fucking suit on, and hey, I'll pick up my, hold on, let's see, did I even match my pants, should I tuck, do you tuck in a suit, should I tuck this in?

8
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:42,920
should I tuck this part in, so it's like that, hey, I'm here for the job interview, I get it, that's right, regional manager, that's gonna be me, fireman, yeah, actually this is probably the first time I've worn this shirt, it's just been, actually no, that's not true, I wore it once on the way over here, it's a really comfortable shirt though, I have too many shirts, I have like 14 Star Wars shorts, I have, I probably have 14 Star Wars shorts too,

9
00:05:42,920 --> 00:06:21,899
all right, without further ado, what do you say we get started, how this is gonna play out is like this, we've got 17 or 18 different categories, you guys have voted, the votes are up, I've tallied them all, I got them all here in envelopes, we're gonna find out what the best and worst dreams, best and worst moments of 2018 are, I'm gonna put my headphones in because I'm curious about how this plays out, so without further ado, the first category is worst new character,

10
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:28,899
worst new character, why don't we take a look at the nominees for worst new character.

11
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:50,100
I do quality work, okay, I do quality work, I hope not, you think I'm just gonna not do quality work, roll over, let's make sure we can see the Hanes, oh yes we can, absolutely, he's perfect.

12
00:06:50,100 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't, I hate drama, I really don't want to do it, but his audience and him have said some dumb things, first of all his name is grill master x barbecue, and the guy hasn't cooked any food on stream in at least, at least like two years, you couldn't even tell how fast that was.

13
00:07:41,740 --> 00:08:48,840
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could get a drum roll please, if I could get one of those that'd be nice, ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the 2018 worst new character goes to, the what, with 28.4% of the vote, ladies and gentlemen, grill master x barbecue is the worst new character of 2018, he sucked, with nearly 28% of the vote, that's actually very surprising.

14
00:08:48,840 --> 00:09:04,990
I was certain it was going to be bugleberry, and just in case it was bugleberry, I was well prepared to invite, invite bugleberry here to do a little presentation if he had won.

15
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,990
I've got to give the award to somebody, a worst new character who made him.

16
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,450
I did.

17
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,419
Thank you, thank you very much, I appreciate that.

18
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:40,419
First thing I want to say about, you know, when you make a new character it can be very very difficult, trying to figure out the backstory and where they come from, what's their motivation, how tall are they, how small are they, do they have, where are they from in the world, it's a tough thing to do and sometimes you fucking miss, but remember if you're a baseball player, if you fail seven out of ten times you're still a fucking Hall of Fame player, they'll take it.

19
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,419
That's the first award of the night, that's worst character of last year.

20
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,850
Hard work to make, it's hard work to make a new character.

21
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,850
I've got to get that off the screen, it's going to fuck up my vision.

22
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,330
Do you see these envelopes by the way?

23
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,330
These are the real deal, look at these.

24
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,019
Funny thing, these are wedding invitations.

25
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,019
Invitation.

26
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:18,110
I was trying to find something that I could actually use to be, to make it fun, but there you go.

27
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,110
I did not think he was going to get 28%.

28
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,059
I thought that was going to be bugleberry for sure.

29
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,059
Oh well, reuse it for a wedding.

30
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:44,019
Oh by the way, just in case anyone wants to know, it's going to get probably insanely loud because I am right in the heart of Las Vegas.

31
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:50,019
So this is New Year's Eve and I forgot about this so I was thinking to myself, oh yeah, New Year's Eve stream.

32
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,460
I think there's like half a million fucking people here right now.

33
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,950
Like I'm going to get stuck here.

34
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,509
Like in the heart.

35
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,460
I'm in the heart right now.

36
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,809
There's like half a million people fucking here right now, whatever.

37
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,809
What are we moving to the next category?

38
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:16,759
This next category is, no it's not beater, not yet.

39
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,669
This is the worst sweat category.

40
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:28,509
For those of you that voted for this one, there were a lot of weird options.

41
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,509
Some of them weren't even sweat.

42
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:34,509
That's fine, I will take the loss on some of these.

43
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:40,389
Let's check out the nominees for worst sweat of the year.

44
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:44,389
Now this includes, greasy face, sloppy hair.

45
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:49,570
No, no, no, no, no, no, worst hair is the next one.

46
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,570
Alright, I get confused sometimes because the worst sweat is sweat.

47
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,570
It's sweaty face, sweaty body.

48
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,570
I don't know why the fuck this is even a category, but you know what?

49
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,259
Now let me check out the nominees for worst sweat of 2018.

50
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:02,250
Satan's dream.

51
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,250
Whoa!

52
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,320
Why am I made out of plastic?

53
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
I swear to God I don't look like this.

54
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:24,220
I don't look like this.

55
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:37,159
And the winner of worst sweat for 2018 is...

56
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,159
With 33% of the vote we've got...

57
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,509
Plastic face birdhouse.

58
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:49,120
And do it again!

59
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,100
Plastic face birdhouse.

60
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,100
That wasn't even sweat though, that was just the weird...

61
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,590
I had a sheen on my face. Does that actually count?

62
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,019
What about right now? How do I look now, huh?

63
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,649
You don't see a drop on me.

64
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:10,820
I was thinking what would be kind of a funny...

65
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,059
A funny joke would be...

66
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:16,059
Do all these categories tonight and be covered in sweat.

67
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,059
Have terrible fucking hair. Make a ton of awful jokes.

68
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,059
Make a ton of great jokes.

69
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,559
Have every category play out right now.

70
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,559
And have a final voting for it.

71
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,559
But there it goes, worst sweat, plastic.

72
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,559
But come on, here's the thing about the sweat thing, right?

73
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm sitting down screaming every day.

74
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
I scream. Right now I'm screaming.

75
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,360
But you don't understand, my normal speaking voice is this.

76
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,600
And for a long time it took a while to get the ability to talk louder.

77
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,600
But over time I practice.

78
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
And right now I'm screaming as loud as I can.

79
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,600
So when you do that, you build up a lot of perspiration.

80
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
You build up your...

81
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll take the... whatever. I lose.

82
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Thanks for the award. I appreciate it.

83
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Because that was also me.

84
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
But you know what I mean though?

85
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
I'm under stress sometimes.

86
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm playing video games.

87
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
And it gets too much.

88
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You lock yourself into the seat and you just...

89
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,659
Whatever.

90
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,659
I'm already subconsciously touching my hair.

91
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:25,419
Because that's the next category is worst hair.

92
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,419
I get a lot of shit for this.

93
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:29,720
Over the years.

94
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
But you have to remember, when you get to be my age,

95
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
when you grow to over 30 years old,

96
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,720
you're not worried about your hair anymore.

97
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,019
Some of you guys that are in your 20s,

98
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,019
that are in your late teens or something,

99
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,019
and you're out there having a good time on New Year's Eve,

100
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,019
you got gel in your hair and it looks fucking great,

101
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,019
and you look in the mirror and you're like,

102
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,019
fucking nice, man.

103
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,580
I don't do that.

104
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,580
I don't do that anymore.

105
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,580
I just wake up, shake my head as hard as I can,

106
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,259
and then take a shower,

107
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,500
comb it hard too.

108
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Ow! Ow! Ow!

109
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I make sure it fucking hurts.

110
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Every day.

111
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,340
I don't do it anymore.

112
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,340
I don't really care about the hair anymore.

113
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,779
The hair is just on my head.

114
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,340
So it doesn't really make me that upset

115
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,340
when people talk about the nominees for worst hair anymore.

116
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Oh, that was a lot of lipstick.

117
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,750
Here you go.

118
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,019
More on a journey

119
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,019
through verdant fields and Viridian cities

120
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,019
in a timeless west.

121
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:44,019
I can't beat Vaughn Faith Kim right now, by the way.

122
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,019
What? Are you serious?

123
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,509
Holy shit, there's a button. There's a B in here.

124
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,509
Oh, fuck me. Goodbye.

125
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:59,779
There it is. Holy shit.

126
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,779
My sideburn's a different length.

127
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:11,190
You know, I got a lot of shit from my hair.

128
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,190
People were saying like, well, you look like a fucking,

129
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,190
you look like a real villain.

130
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,750
I slicked it back today.

131
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,750
So I actually look like a fucking real like 80s movie villain.

132
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Slick back with oil.

133
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,190
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

134
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:48,029
I'm gonna need this later, but I'll use it right now.

135
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:50,029
Man bun.

136
00:17:50,029 --> 00:18:01,940
And the w-

137
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

138
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
What was wrong with the rubber band hair?

139
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,549
You know what I mean?

140
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:11,549
It was just up and poofy on the sides.

141
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,549
What was actually inherently wrong with that hair?

142
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:17,839
Wasn't a man bun.

143
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,839
A man bun would have to go all the way back up like this and up.

144
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,529
My hairline's really, actually really bad now.

145
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:31,049
I had a stylist coming in to do it today.

146
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,250
I'm in a goddamn studio.

147
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,740
You see it today?

148
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
Oh, bad hair, huh?

149
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,329
Take a look at that.

150
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:45,500
Stylist came in, took five steps into the door,

151
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
sprayed from like 10 feet away with his hairspray,

152
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
and then left.

153
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,960
She was $225.

154
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:05,740
Worst hair of the year goes to...

155
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,369
With 18% of the vote, it was pretty close, I will tell you.

156
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:16,640
It was the Burnout Paradise bathrobe hair.

157
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,380
Now, was that so much hair as it was I looked terrifying in that picture?

158
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:30,539
I think it was more so how I looked in the picture than I did the actual haircut.

159
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,849
18%.

160
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:34,849
It was very spread out.

161
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:40,920
It was one of the closest ones, I believe, if I can take a look here.

162
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
It was both.

163
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Yeah, but was it really, though?

164
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,420
I don't think it was that.

165
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
It was the face I was making.

166
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
It was bad angle.

167
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,619
You had no hair.

168
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:54,619
What hair?

169
00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:02,220
What hair?

170
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
Actually, let me pull it up because I'm curious as to how...

171
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,460
Some of these were really close, so I'll just pull them up.

172
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,140
Now, if you're wondering, there was a lot of responses.

173
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,440
I was kind of concerned that having less than a day of voting,

174
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
there were more than 4,000 responses,

175
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,619
so that's pretty great for having it be one day.

176
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,920
Anyway, worst hair.

177
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,569
Yeah, so Burnout Paradise had 18%,

178
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:39,869
and then the closest one to that was the sideburns don't match with 15.3%.

179
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,869
Everything else was very even after that.

180
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:46,339
So, you know.

181
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:57,319
Hey, we're getting to some better categories now,

182
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:00,319
not just like how disgusting and ugly is Jeremy.

183
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,390
Who came up with these categories?

184
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,680
Oh, wait.

185
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I forgot to take it.

186
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Thanks for bananas.

187
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,940
That's another way.

188
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
And I explained the award.

189
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,940
I have to take these top bananas, and then...

190
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
Are we at Peter yet?

191
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
No, this is best noise.

192
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,700
I mean, this is also kind of a strange category.

193
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,700
How many bananas do you think I can fit in my pocket?

194
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,640
I bet you I could fit at least like four bananas in here.

195
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,420
All right.

196
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,230
Best noise.

197
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,859
This is the category that over the years

198
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,859
during stressful situations and during video games,

199
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:45,859
especially stuff just kind of comes out of my mouth,

200
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:46,859
and I can't stop it.

201
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:47,859
I can't help it.

202
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:49,859
There is a worst noise category as well.

203
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:50,859
So don't worry.

204
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:52,859
This is not just like, oh, we're doing the best one.

205
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,859
There's more worst than best categories for this broadcast.

206
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:58,859
So just be aware of that.

207
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:03,640
Best noise.

208
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,029
Somebody raided us?

209
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,029
Well, I don't have my stream lab,

210
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:11,779
so thanks for the raid, whoever you are.

211
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:14,859
Welcome everybody that came from that raid.

212
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:15,859
Thank you.

213
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,289
Hopefully you have a good New Year's Eve.

214
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,289
And speaking of which,

215
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:19,289
you guys are going to have to remind me

216
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:22,289
because already it's 1030 right now, right?

217
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,529
Eastern.

218
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:24,529
We're going by Eastern time.

219
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:27,539
So when the ball drops Eastern,

220
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,710
I'm tearing the rest of these up,

221
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,710
and I'm getting the fuck out of here.

222
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,710
No, I'm kidding.

223
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,210
So it is 1030.

224
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,579
We got an hour and a half before the ball drops in New York.

225
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:40,900
So I need to be ready for that.

226
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,140
I don't have, by the way,

227
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,140
I don't have anything special planned for that shit.

228
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,150
It was a miracle to get this whole thing set up in two days.

229
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,930
I was going to have like a ball drop.

230
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,930
No, we're just going to be like,

231
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,930
Hey, there it is.

232
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,930
Happy fucking New Year.

233
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,930
The ball went down.

234
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:05,029
So we are now on to this best noise.

235
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,039
And let's go check out the nominees for best noise of 2018

236
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:13,039
that comes out of my mouth or the come.

237
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
I'm already getting stuck.

238
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
It comes out of a, you know, my mouth in general.

239
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,269
Here are the nominees.

240
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,460
A bunch of kids like, oh, fuck you.

241
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,940
Look at them.

242
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
You just walk in and you just go like.

243
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,099
And they'll all go.

244
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:21,019
Well, you can't take any damage, guys.

245
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,420
Fuck you.

246
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
You guys suck.

247
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:41,279
Watching that back is like,

248
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

249
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,660
The winner for 2018 best noise as chosen by you,

250
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
the viewers is.

251
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,269
Yeah.

252
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:07,539
The didgeridoo beer with 24% of the vote.

253
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,130
Didgeridoo beer is the winner.

254
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:16,119
Well, it really wasn't even close.

255
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:27,970
So 24% do it again.

256
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,970
Do it a re-vote.

257
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,339
What do you mean?

258
00:25:31,339 --> 00:25:32,339
That's not possible.

259
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:33,339
I'll tell you.

260
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,339
I'll give you the exact numbers right now.

261
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,339
Not possible, they say.

262
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:38,980
Here are the numbers.

263
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,940
So we have,

264
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:56,980
we have,

265
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
didgeridoo beer was 24%.

266
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,470
Coming in second place

267
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,839
was German snort.

268
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,660
And then in third place was the Dark Souls

269
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,660
screech re thing.

270
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,019
So there are your top three.

271
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:20,769
So with every best noise,

272
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,940
there is a worst noise.

273
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,299
No, don't look at it.

274
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,299
I was about to be like,

275
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,299
the winner is.

276
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,299
No, I have to wait until we see the nominees.

277
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:36,309
These are numbers.

278
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:38,309
These are the numbers, by the way.

279
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,259
Oh, the award.

280
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:41,259
Right.

281
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:53,059
How many bananas can he fit in here?

282
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,059
Thank you for the award, everybody.

283
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,059
I appreciate it.

284
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:01,140
Am I going to be drinking more coffee?

285
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
I wonder if I do.

286
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Okay.

287
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
This has been my life.

288
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Anytime that I want to get something done.

289
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,140
You know what I mean?

290
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
I just drink a shit.

291
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
No, this is bad advice.

292
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,140
I'm not going to give bad advice on my.

293
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
No, you know,

294
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
we'll give bad advice because it's New Year's

295
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
and New Year's resolution is get rid of your bad advice

296
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
and take in the good advice.

297
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Right.

298
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
So bad advice for 2018.

299
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
Don't do this.

300
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
There's only like one more like hour for you to do this.

301
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,140
There's drink coffee past eight or nine p.m.

302
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,140
Don't do that anymore.

303
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
Don't do that anymore.

304
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
New Year's resolution.

305
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,140
No more coffee after like seven p.m.

306
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:41,569
That's now impossible.

307
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,569
Worst noise of the year coming up.

308
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:47,509
I think people are going to be really upset about these

309
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,509
because some of the worst noises,

310
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,509
I think should probably be in the best noises,

311
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,509
at least in my opinion and vice versa.

312
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,509
I didn't make the rules.

313
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,509
I just made the categories.

314
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:04,400
The nominees for worst noise of 2018 are.

315
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:31,900
I know.

316
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Like this thing's so weak.

317
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:48,009
Yeet.

318
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,180
Crooked monster.

319
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,180
The mass ray.

320
00:28:53,549 --> 00:29:02,059
Increase XP from defeating enemies.

321
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,059
Perfect dodge temporarily increases damage.

322
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:10,099
Oh, fuck.

323
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,099
Okay.

324
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,910
Get it.

325
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:24,710
Go get the gun.

326
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,039
I hate the sound of tape.

327
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,039
I'm sorry, guys.

328
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,039
This is like turning on an oven for me.

329
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,039
I don't like ovens.

330
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,039
I hate turning on an oven and it like freaks me out.

331
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,039
I like this like box in your house

332
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,039
that heats up to like fucking 500 degrees.

333
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,039
I don't like it.

334
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,039
It's weird and it's gas.

335
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,039
This is also, I don't like this.

336
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:45,680
I didn't press that button yet.

337
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,069
Why did it do that?

338
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:51,069
Anyways, there are your nominees

339
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:55,069
for worst noise of 2018.

340
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:59,490
And there can only be one winner though.

341
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:05,609
Your winner of worst noise in 2018 is.

342
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:16,059
With 14.9% of the vote,

343
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,059
this was, the jury was really out there on this one.

344
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:24,130
The Oblivion webcam scream is the winner.

345
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,930
The Oblivion turn the volume down

346
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,930
and peak your microphone until you break it sound.

347
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,230
It was the worst noise in 2018.

348
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:40,890
They were all there.

349
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:41,890
They were all real bad.

350
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,730
Play it again.

351
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,990
Why do you want to replay that one?

352
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:53,220
You guys want me to replay that video?

353
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,650
Are you sure?

354
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,650
You guys want to see that again.

355
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,650
What's wrong with my backdrop?

356
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,650
I don't know.

357
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,980
Maybe I should just get another one.

358
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:12,140
I'll replay it again if you want.

359
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Okay.

360
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:21,910
I'm going to play it one more time.

361
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,910
Oblivion webcam mic peak.

362
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,910
Here we go.

363
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,910
Here's the other nominees.

364
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,910
By the way, the nominees for best,

365
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,910
worst noise of the year are.

366
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:44,369
Why am I replaying this?

367
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:57,660
Just play the Oblivion one again.

368
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,660
I thought you guys wanted me to play the whole video.

369
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
Why would I do that?

370
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,150
Only the winner?

371
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,150
That's going to be hard to do.

372
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,839
Well, here you go.

373
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,839
Here it comes.

374
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,079
Yeet.

375
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,079
Crookie monster.

376
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,509
The mass raid.

377
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:20,509
I'll mute the video until it gets here.

378
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:28,190
Increase XP from defeating enemies.

379
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,190
Perfect.

380
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,940
All right.

381
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
There it is.

382
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940
There's your winner again.

383
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Director's commentary.

384
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,119
I don't really have any director's commentary.

385
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,119
Go get it.

386
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,059
Go get the gun.

387
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,059
What do you want me to say?

388
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,059
I screamed this time.

389
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:47,460
I don't want to.

390
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
I don't want to see the tape one again.

391
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
No, no, no, no, no.

392
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
I'm not doing the tape one.

393
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
I actually fucking hate that noise.

394
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,539
Did I already pick the winner?

395
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:56,539
Yeah.

396
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,720
Okay.

397
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
What?

398
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,109
All right.

399
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,109
We're good.

400
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,109
What time is it?

401
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,109
We got a time check here.

402
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:12,640
All right.

403
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
We got about we got an hour and 20 minutes before the ball drops in New York City.

404
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Well, I'm sorry.

405
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
It's been a long couple of days.

406
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
I don't know what the fuck this was, but I apologize for it.

407
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,140
All right.

408
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:25,309
We had to cut a few categories because they just there's one enough time.

409
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:29,309
So we're just going to do something really quickly.

410
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,309
The worst meme, worst new meme of the year only had two nominations.

411
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:40,049
So it was Boomer and Peter.

412
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:43,799
So they both they both went like I was going to do something.

413
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,799
I was going to have like a tug of war versus Boomer and Peter.

414
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,799
But they both they both fucking went like they come on.

415
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,799
What do you want to say?

416
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,799
There's two nominations.

417
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,799
How am I going to take one of these bananas?

418
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:05,000
This is like Jenga.

419
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Have a live straw poll.

420
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Let's get that fucking banana in there.

421
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,909
All right.

422
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:14,909
What's next?

423
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,909
OK.

424
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,340
Wait.

425
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Oh, the mic is right here.

426
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I forgot.

427
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I'm on my laptop right now.

428
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,340
We have this category.

429
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,340
This category is worst death of the year in a game.

430
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,840
You know, whether I fell off a cliff or something happened to my character.

431
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
This is worst deaths of the year.

432
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,079
So why don't we check out the nominees for worst deaths of 2018?

433
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:54,750
I don't think I'm ready for this pinwheel.

434
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,849
Am I too heavy for this fight?

435
00:34:58,849 --> 00:34:59,849
Maybe.

436
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:04,849
Oh, it's one of these stupid fights where there's a there's like a clone.

437
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:08,539
OK, well, I don't know what the fuck he does.

438
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:15,480
So the first time you see a boss, you can't expect to win.

439
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,300
I just don't know which one is real.

440
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
That's the problem.

441
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,300
And if it takes me 15 fucking deaths to figure that out, there's nothing even in this bottle.

442
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,050
Oh, what the fuck?

443
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,349
No, I'm not going to spend my souls because I don't know what I want.

444
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:34,349
I don't know what to level.

445
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,780
Brought these in.

446
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
This was a pain in the ass to farm these.

447
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,219
I read on the Wikipedia page that you can actually throw these at them, right?

448
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,219
And it hurts 135.

449
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:47,219
That's not even close to what I was doing.

450
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,219
I was doing like two.

451
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:53,460
You can't light actual enemies on fire, right?

452
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,300
135 is so bad.

453
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Why did I farm these?

454
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Why did I do this?

455
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,179
I should have been used this from the very beginning.

456
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:15,460
Like if I use this from the very beginning.

457
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,150
My hitbox is so stupid.

458
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:25,269
Oh, get away from me.

459
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:32,929
I haven't died anywhere else.

460
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:43,449
And pinwheel.

461
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:49,420
Worst death of the year.

462
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,650
And moving on, we've got the...

463
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,650
How many people are here right now?

464
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,650
I wonder.

465
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,889
Oh, I need a banana.

466
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,889
Oh, yeah, that's right, a banana.

467
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,889
Uh-oh.

468
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:12,960
I can get this.

469
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

470
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:30,980
I'll get that one.

471
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
I'll pick that one up later.

472
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
That one fell.

473
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,420
Thank you for the worst death award there.

474
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,420
So that gets...

475
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Hold on, we're almost at the...

476
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,829
Hold on, let me just get...

477
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,829
Sorry.

478
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,829
So I can have some more awards later.

479
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:51,340
So we've made it to...

480
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,340
There's still a lot to go.

481
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,340
So don't worry.

482
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:00,960
We've got our best feeder and worst feeder are coming up here in just a moment.

483
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,349
What's wrong?

484
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:04,349
Collar?

485
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,829
Oh, fuck.

486
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:08,829
Right.

487
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm sorry about that.

488
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,579
Oh, let me fix it.

489
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:17,699
How do you guys pick up on this shit so quickly?

490
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:21,699
That would have taken me like three hours at a party to figure that out.

491
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,699
Fly is down.

492
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,699
It is not.

493
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,699
We already checked that before the stream started.

494
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:29,059
Oops.

495
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,940
Let's just leave it on because here we go.

496
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:38,340
It's time for the best feeder of 2018.

497
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,469
How many people are here right now?

498
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:46,900
So there are over 6,000 people watching right now.

499
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Bet you about 500 of them leave in the next 20, 30 seconds.

500
00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:00,369
Because we're about to do the fucking Peter shit.

501
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:07,829
Which I think only like 50 people in this chat think this is funny.

502
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:08,829
And I'm not even one of them.

503
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:14,329
By the way, we were looking up shit about Peter, right?

504
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:19,869
Did you guys know that I've been saying this word for over a year and a half?

505
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:21,869
It's been a fucking year and a half.

506
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,869
I don't remember me saying this for the first time.

507
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,199
When did this start and why has it not stopped?

508
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,889
I don't know.

509
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:33,190
I thought I started saying this two or three months ago.

510
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,190
It's been like two years.

511
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:42,550
I think it's because somebody in this community's name is Peter.

512
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,550
And they've given a lot of donations and I've read the messages.

513
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,550
And sometimes I just go like, hey, thanks, Peter.

514
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,550
And they just went from there.

515
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,730
I have no idea.

516
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,730
But this is the best Peter.

517
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,730
This is the best Peter of the year coming up here.

518
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,730
Next category, best Peter.

519
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:02,530
Let's see which one it is.

520
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,530
All of the towers have been unlocked.

521
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,530
You guys are in.

522
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,530
This is the end game.

523
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:12,530
Peter, Peter, we're at the end game now.

524
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,530
Thank you, Peter.

525
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,530
Peter, again, for the one dollar.

526
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,530
Hello.

527
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,409
Hello, Peter.

528
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:18,409
Hello, Peter.

529
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:19,409
Peter.

530
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:20,409
Hey, Peter.

531
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:21,409
Hello, Peter.

532
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:23,710
No facial hair.

533
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,710
Peter, it's Stewie Griffin.

534
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:35,539
Why am I making everybody from family guys?

535
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:40,150
Peter, you're a scientist.

536
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,289
I'm something of a scientist myself.

537
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:44,289
demonic cucumber.

538
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:45,289
Thanks for the one dollar.

539
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:50,289
Can you tell me the name of a cooking device specifically used to mix eggs?

540
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:54,360
An egg beater.

541
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:02,210
Well, that was pretty good.

542
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:23,500
Ladies and gentlemen, the best Peter of 2019 is with 26% of the vote.

543
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,500
That's a lot of people with a lot of clicks.

544
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,860
I'm something of a scientist myself, Peter.

545
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,480
26%.

546
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,730
Scientist Peter.

547
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,030
This was the best Peter of the whole year.

548
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:49,880
No, don't pull the action figures on back that far.

549
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Don't do it.

550
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
That's over the recommended manufacturer's length.

551
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,119
Don't do it, Johnny.

552
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,119
Oh, fuck.

553
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:17,030
It's only supposed to go up to here.

554
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,030
Not say Peter.

555
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,030
I didn't.

556
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,030
I am a thousand percent certain.

557
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,030
God fucking damn it.

558
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,030
Who cares if I said Peter?

559
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,030
I don't give a fuck.

560
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,030
Why does it matter?

561
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,030
That shouldn't matter.

562
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,030
That shouldn't matter.

563
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,030
Of all things to matter right now, and I was going well.

564
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,030
And he said Peter.

565
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,340
Cronk, like the emperor's new groove?

566
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,150
Hey, it's me, Patrick Warburg, Cronk.

567
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,150
You know, I'm Joe from Family Guy 2.

568
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,150
Peter.

569
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,150
Hey, Peter.

570
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,150
Let me tell you something, Peter.

571
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,150
Peter, it's the soup.

572
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:59,820
It was the goblin.

573
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
What should I say?

574
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820
Peter.

575
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:16,030
Oh, so bad.

576
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,030
The worst Peter.

577
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,030
The worst Peter.

578
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,030
One of them was from like 2016.

579
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,030
Worst Peter of the year.

580
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:39,880
Ladies and gentlemen, the worst Peter.

581
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,909
Hotline Miami 2 Peter Breakdown with 29% of the vote.

582
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,909
I was going to just start eating this, but I'm not.

583
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:49,909
No, no, no, no, no.

584
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:50,909
I've got indigestion.

585
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:51,909
29% of the vote.

586
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:53,909
Hotline Miami 2 Peter Breakdown.

587
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:56,409
And it made that make sense.

588
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:00,659
It does.

589
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:01,659
There you go.

590
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:07,340
The worst Peter of 2018 or 2016.

591
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:12,360
OK, what time is it?

592
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,710
We've got about one hour.

593
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,230
Change the backdrop.

594
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,230
Why don't we just check in on how you guys are doing?

595
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,179
How are you guys feeling out there?

596
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,179
You guys good?

597
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:34,500
You guys doing all right out there?

598
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,579
You sure?

599
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,579
Fucking idiots.

600
00:44:41,579 --> 00:45:04,059
Yeah, keep fucking dancing out there and booing.

601
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:05,059
All right.

602
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,059
Nobody said change the backdrop?

603
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:07,059
Yeah, they did.

604
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:10,739
Everyone's having so much fun.

605
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:15,059
Booing Jeremy at his award show.

606
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:17,059
And I just realized what I was doing there.

607
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:18,059
Don't.

608
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:19,059
That's going to get cut into a fucking.

609
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:21,059
Ow, my fingers.

610
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:27,260
Take that award.

611
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,260
The Pneuma guy.

612
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,210
No, no, no, no.

613
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,210
I was.

614
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,210
Ah, put your hands down.

615
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,210
Is this suit too small for me?

616
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,510
Am I just coming to the realization right now?

617
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:50,190
Wait, is that supposed to happen?

618
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,420
Like, it's not supposed to come up this far.

619
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,420
If I go to like shake somebody's hand, my suit's not supposed to fall off, right?

620
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,610
But how does it sit on me normally?

621
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,610
Like, how does it sit on my body?

622
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,320
You know what I mean?

623
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
If I was walking down the street, right?

624
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,289
It looks fine.

625
00:46:13,289 --> 00:46:24,829
I just can't ever like go like that.

626
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:25,829
Hey, how are you?

627
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:26,829
I'll have to go like this.

628
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:29,670
Hey, how are you?

629
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,670
I have to check my fly every now and again.

630
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:40,500
All right, next category is going to be the best flavor of ice cream for 2018.

631
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Sometimes your opinions change year to year.

632
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Just want to make sure we got the correct one for 2018.

633
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,059
Here are the nominees for best ice cream of the year.

634
00:46:50,059 --> 00:47:42,800
Ice cream of flavor of the year.

635
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:51,929
Why does that keep playing when I change my scene?

636
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:54,170
What do you mean no vanilla?

637
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,170
Vanilla's on there like three times.

638
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:02,880
The best ice cream flavor, best ice cream kind of ice cream in 2018.

639
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Whoa, I forgot about this one.

640
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,880
I forgot how crazy this one was.

641
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:30,280
So with 45% of the vote, 45% of the vote, you heard that correct, cookie dough.

642
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:40,110
There was 4,000 responders and almost half of you guys picked cookie dough.

643
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:45,139
Cookie dough is a great ice cream, but is it better than faded lemon?

644
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,139
I'm not sure.

645
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:48,730
That's rigged.

646
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:54,349
I think you underestimate how much people love cookie dough ice cream.

647
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:56,349
They'll just click it when they see it on screen.

648
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,349
Even if they know that there's something better for an option.

649
00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:01,679
Do a recount.

650
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,010
No, you know how I know it's legit?

651
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,010
Because I clicked cookie dough ice cream.

652
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,010
I remember like talking to at least two or three people that also took that poll.

653
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,010
They all clicked cookie dough ice cream.

654
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,010
We should have just removed it.

655
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:19,659
Confirmed rigged.

656
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:22,659
No, I just said, but you can't tell anybody who you voted for.

657
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,349
I know.

658
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,349
What?

659
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,349
So if somebody asked you, hey, who did you vote for?

660
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:29,349
You could say, like, I don't want to tell you.

661
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:30,349
That's fine.

662
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,530
But if that person says, hey, who did you vote for?

663
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,530
You go, I'll tell you who I voted for, sure.

664
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:38,980
Mike Malarkey.

665
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,980
I don't know.

666
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,980
Whoever the fuck it is.

667
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,289
Dean Dingus, like, for all that matters.

668
00:49:43,289 --> 00:49:46,420
I mean, that's illegal.

669
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:54,079
It's not illegal to tell somebody who you voted for.

670
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:06,650
Speaking of literally none of the things we were just talking about,

671
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,650
best impression of the year?

672
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,909
I sometimes dabble in character work.

673
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:13,909
You know what I mean?

674
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:15,909
I sometimes dabble in doing character voices.

675
00:50:15,909 --> 00:50:19,920
And 2018, there were quite a few good ones.

676
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:30,500
So for best impression of the year, let's take a look at the nominees.

677
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:36,090
And I know that each one of these videos is probably very loud when it starts.

678
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,090
So just be careful.

679
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:40,090
When you see the video, just drop your volume by 5%

680
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,090
and then I'm going to take care of it from there.

681
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,090
Worst best impression of the year?

682
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:51,300
Peter, I hear you're by the scientist.

683
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:56,570
Well, I'm something of a scientist myself.

684
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:04,139
Get that in a fucking Petri dish, motherfucker!

685
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:07,139
All right, man, if you think this dead body is crazy,

686
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:09,139
share this video with two of your friends.

687
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:12,630
Okay, guys, so that's going to wrap it up here.

688
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,630
We're going to have to check this out in the next video.

689
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,630
You know what I mean?

690
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:16,630
Like, we've got a detective work here.

691
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,630
We're going to turn into Batman.

692
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,630
Give that video a punch.

693
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,630
Shoot it to the moon.

694
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,630
And I'll see you guys in the next one.

695
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:24,630
See you soon.

696
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,219
Hey, what's going on, sinners?

697
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:28,219
Welcome to another video.

698
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,219
This is part 39.

699
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:34,219
Why would you raise your hand this high over like this?

700
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,219
That doesn't make any sense to me.

701
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:43,190
Like, the doggy paddle, to me, is a lot more efficient.

702
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,190
It just does.

703
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,750
Wouldn't you want to, like, go up and in like this,

704
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,750
wicked quick, like a chicken?

705
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,820
But, you know, you give and you take, right?

706
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,820
Just like the Lord does.

707
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,820
The Lord gives and the Lord takes.

708
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,260
And the Lord gives away.

709
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,260
Just like you would be to me.

710
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,260
I really need five dollars.

711
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,260
If you could just find it,

712
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,260
your godly heart gets given to me.

713
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,260
I'm going to put my hands around right now.

714
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,260
You just got to put five dollars in there.

715
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,260
That's it.

716
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,260
You're going to be out of your hair.

717
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,260
I mean, you won the opportunity for a lifetime.

718
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,260
And yes, you're going to get a Disney World trip.

719
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,260
But who cares about the Disney World trip?

720
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,260
When at the end of the day, you're going to give me five dollars.

721
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,260
I can't wait until Sans comes out here and he goes...

722
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,260
You should have gone with the head.

723
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,949
Because of this, I'm going to do two hands.

724
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,320
Everyone dies.

725
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,460
That means me, too.

726
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

727
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,460
No, that means me.

728
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
No, no, no.

729
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:57,710
I did not take it back.

730
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,710
By the way, spoilers if you haven't seen Infinity War.

731
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,019
Everybody's seen Infinity War at this point.

732
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,019
No one's not seen it.

733
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,019
If you haven't seen Infinity War, I'm sorry.

734
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:08,019
But like, why haven't you?

735
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,019
No one's seen it yet.

736
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:12,019
No, everybody's seen Infinity War.

737
00:53:12,019 --> 00:53:14,019
I don't know why I have to keep saying that.

738
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:18,559
Hey, by the way, if you haven't seen Infinity War yet,

739
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,559
here's another one.

740
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,400
You haven't seen it.

741
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
I haven't seen it.

742
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
I haven't seen it.

743
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,780
You haven't?

744
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,780
I haven't seen it.

745
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:39,300
How have you not seen it?

746
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,300
Infinity War is like, have you seen Star Wars?

747
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,300
Have you seen the new Star Wars movie?

748
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,300
I want to know how many people.

749
00:53:46,300 --> 00:54:05,820
With 32% of the vote, that's a majority.

750
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:11,820
There was like 10, 10, 10, 32% is Sans.

751
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:16,679
Sans is the winner.

752
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:19,820
Look at them all there.

753
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,820
Oh, they're so happy about that one.

754
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:34,619
Sans wins.

755
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,710
Fireworks.

756
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:38,710
Where was the Yoshi clip?

757
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,710
It got lost in the...

758
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:41,710
Yoshi!

759
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,809
You know what I mean?

760
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:47,809
Wait, it actually might be on worst impression.

761
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:49,809
I forget.

762
00:54:49,809 --> 00:54:54,460
You're going to start hearing like explosions.

763
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:01,110
This is New Year's Eve in Las Vegas.

764
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:05,699
It's going to be like crazy.

765
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:08,900
And we're in the heart.

766
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Do the voice.

767
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,269
What voice?

768
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,050
Do Sans.

769
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,050
I don't think I can do it.

770
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,050
I don't want to like peek the microphone.

771
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,050
Let me see how this sounds.

772
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:29,210
I need to like listen to it.

773
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,579
Let me just listen.

774
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,139
I can hear it.

775
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:37,019
Hold on.

776
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:39,699
This is going to hurt.

777
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:44,289
I can't do it with you looking at me.

778
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:46,530
I've got to turn the fucking camera off.

779
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:51,389
I've got to just...

780
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,219
I can turn that off now.

781
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:11,019
So that was...

782
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,019
Did I do it?

783
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:14,019
No, this is worst impression.

784
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:20,460
Oh, we didn't even do this one yet.

785
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:26,150
OK, spoiler for Undertale.

786
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:28,030
Get out of here.

787
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,030
Like, get that out of here.

788
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,030
Spoiler for Undertale is a character in it named Sans.

789
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:36,030
And he goes, a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a.

790
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,030
Really?

791
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,550
That's a spoiler.

792
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,860
No, don't peek at it yet.

793
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:50,289
The nominees for Worst Impression of the Year are...

794
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,579
OK?

795
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,579
He's joking.

796
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:27,340
It's the worst bane I've ever heard.

797
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,340
No!

798
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,340
George Washington!

799
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,840
Please someone listen to this gritty, gruffy man!

800
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,599
What if he talked like this?

801
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:36,039
This was his real voice?

802
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,039
Nobody knows.

803
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:38,400
It's not recorded.

804
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
I hope he sounded like this.

805
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,989
Where's the tape recording?

806
00:57:41,989 --> 00:57:42,989
Wait a minute.

807
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:55,039
We've got a suicide squad.

808
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,349
Oh, you forgot to do.

809
00:57:56,349 --> 00:57:57,349
Ah.

810
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,349
Ah.

811
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,349
Ah.

812
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:00,780
Leo.

813
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
The best Joker laughing I've ever heard.

814
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,780
That was terrible.

815
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,780
That was terrible.

816
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,239
Delete that too.

817
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:07,239
I was at Target today, and there was episode in the front row in front of me

818
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:08,239
in the title checkout.

819
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,320
You know what I'm saying?

820
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
Yeah.

821
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,320
Yeah.

822
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
And I said, hey, excuse me.

823
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,199
I was at Target today, and there was episode in the front row in front of me in the

824
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,199
title checkout.

825
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,199
You know what I'm saying?

826
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,550
Yeah.

827
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:29,679
Yeah.

828
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:30,679
And I said, hey, excuse me.

829
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:31,679
Excuse me.

830
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,679
And what she said.

831
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:33,679
I swear to God, I'm not even kidding.

832
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,820
She had yaks up her chin.

833
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,820
Snip, snip, snip.

834
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,639
Another video.

835
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:42,639
Woohoo.

836
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:59,780
So the worst impression of the year is...

837
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:05,469
Do I need to try to do the drum roll?

838
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:06,900
It's like a second.

839
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,900
Good.

840
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,900
Okay.

841
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
The winner with 29% of the vote.

842
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,900
This was really close.

843
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Too close to call, you could say.

844
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:26,579
Until I closed it with 29% of the vote is Donald Duck.

845
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:32,849
Donald Duck is the winner of the worst impression of the year.

846
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:40,679
The gnome was right behind, and I was kind of against the gnome being on the

847
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,679
pole in the first place because I just jumped in front of the camera.

848
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:45,679
It went like this.

849
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:46,679
You know what I mean?

850
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:47,679
This doesn't count.

851
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:58,260
You know what I'm saying?

852
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:02,289
All I did was this.

853
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,679
So that doesn't matter.

854
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:07,679
That's not even an impression.

855
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,000
Where's my...

856
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
There it is.

857
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I've got to snip it back up.

858
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:22,119
Okay.

859
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,119
So I'm glad it didn't win.

860
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,260
Donald Duck is the winner with 29%.

861
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,260
It was like 28% for the gnome.

862
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
Congratulations to me again.

863
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,260
I'll take the top banana.

864
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,260
Thank you so much.

865
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,260
We're running out of pockets on the website.

866
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,570
All right.

867
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,570
I don't know why, but for one second, you hear this?

868
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:47,960
I thought there was like a Game Boy in my pocket, like a DS.

869
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,960
I don't know why DS just jumped right into my brain immediately.

870
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,199
I got a DS in here.

871
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:57,150
Why would I have a DS in there?

872
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,150
A Game Boy.

873
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,150
I see you said Game Boy.

874
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,579
New background.

875
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:01,579
Sure.

876
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:16,190
Coming up, we got some of the best, some of the best of the year.

877
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:20,449
We're getting down to the meaty categories now.

878
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:24,840
What the hell is over here?

879
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,170
We're getting down to the meaty categories.

880
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:32,989
This is the best gamer moment of the year.

881
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:38,360
This is a moment where I did something cool, did something crazy,

882
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,360
accomplished something that is almost unhuman.

883
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
You know what I mean?

884
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,360
Best gamer category of the year.

885
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:54,210
Why is this one frozen?

886
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,539
I have another one.

887
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:57,539
Where is it?

888
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:01,320
I actually, I have another one.

889
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,730
Give me a second.

890
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:10,000
Hold on.

891
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That's not it.

892
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,500
This is not it.

893
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:19,389
That's fucking odd.

894
01:02:19,389 --> 01:02:21,389
That's a little weird for me.

895
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:24,389
Hold on.

896
01:02:24,389 --> 01:02:25,389
Wait a second.

897
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:28,869
Just wait one second.

898
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:36,630
Coming to you live at your campsite.

899
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,630
Hold on.

900
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:48,280
This is important.

901
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:58,280
Hold on.

902
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:09,500
I did like a, I was going to go get a fucking forest.

903
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:16,409
This is too much.

904
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,409
I'm going back to what it was before.

905
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:31,250
I can't do that one.

906
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,250
Best gaming moment of the year.

907
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:43,869
Let's take a look at the nominees for best moment for video game

908
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:46,869
wise of the year.

909
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,869
Here are the nominees.

910
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:50,750
Oh, my life.

911
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,179
Oh, my life.

912
01:03:53,179 --> 01:04:01,929
No.

913
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:03,679
I can do it.

914
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:04,679
I can do it.

915
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:10,079
I can do it.

916
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,079
I can do it.

917
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:18,530
Get the fuck out of here.

918
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,530
Do I have to fight it?

919
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:25,289
Who's fighting?

920
01:04:25,289 --> 01:04:26,289
Make it happen.

921
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:29,710
Come on.

922
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:30,710
Make us proud.

923
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,400
Okay.

924
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
He's fine.

925
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,199
He needs to get hit one more time.

926
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:44,559
Any chop, anything.

927
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,559
He ends it with his fucking signature move.

928
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:51,010
Knock him down.

929
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,010
And I got his fucking friend.

930
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:55,320
It's just me and one guy left.

931
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
One guy.

932
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Where is he?

933
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,619
All right.

934
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:00,820
I got my last hundred dollar bill.

935
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:11,789
My last hundred dollar bill.

936
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:12,789
Here it comes.

937
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:13,789
Final hundred dollar bill.

938
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:14,789
I lost it all.

939
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:20,800
I got one more bill in my pocket and I just sat down at the first machine I saw.

940
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
Jackpot.

941
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
Shoot the car 60 times.

942
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,800
You ready?

943
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
Check this out.

944
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,150
So this is not going to fight.

945
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:51,000
When I was a kid, I beat a bunch of adults in a video game championship at Blockbuster.

946
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I'm a Blockbuster video game champion, an actual champion.

947
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
1995 store championship.

948
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
1995 store champion.

949
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Store champion 1995 Super NES format.

950
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Fucking real.

951
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I got three lives.

952
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Shoot the targets and watch the fireworks.

953
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,369
Five seconds.

954
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:35,239
The winner of best game.

955
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:36,239
What a bunch of great gaming moments.

956
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,239
Why don't we talk about it for a second to delay install time to make sure we can

957
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:41,239
count the ball down.

958
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,239
You know what I mean?

959
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:56,639
I wouldn't have to say that, you know, actually, I don't have anything to say.

960
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,639
No, that that's the organ.

961
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:00,639
Okay.

962
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:10,130
I'm not a good elf.

963
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,130
The prompter is fucking slow.

964
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,059
So just give me a minute.

965
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:17,449
Go on.

966
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:18,449
Get it on there, please.

967
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:22,829
He's actually lost it.

968
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:26,829
So I'm just trying to delay a little because we got like what?

969
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:27,829
40 minutes.

970
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:32,239
Jeremy's going to regret that one.

971
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:33,239
Yes, I am.

972
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:34,739
I already do.

973
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:36,739
I don't need time to regret what I just did.

974
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:38,039
It's live.

975
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:39,039
What am I supposed to do?

976
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,039
Go back and pretend you didn't see that.

977
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,039
I was going back to the bullshit that I did earlier in my brain and decided it

978
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,039
was a good idea to say I'm not I'm I'm not a good elf.

979
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:55,309
When you see something thousands of times, it just puts it into your brain.

980
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:57,739
It's just it's just there.

981
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:05,280
And the whole like feet thing, like I was I'm dropping stuff.

982
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,280
Anyways, that's the origins of Jax.

983
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,280
When I did let me tell you something about that bonus game.

984
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
For real.

985
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,280
This is like me stalling but not stalling.

986
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
This is a real story.

987
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,279
I used to go to the arcade and I used to be I'd had that that video game

988
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:20,279
home at the home console.

989
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:25,279
I have never seen anyone do every one of those targets in the bonus game.

990
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:26,279
Never.

991
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:27,279
Everybody gets to one.

992
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,279
Everybody gets to one or two and the timer runs out.

993
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:31,279
I've never seen somebody complete that.

994
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,279
I did it on stream and that had better win for best gaming moment because

995
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,279
that's that is the best thing I've ever done.

996
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:54,600
The winner for best gaming moment in 2018 is with 31 percent of the vote

997
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:01,600
beating Jevil first try beating Jevil first try.

998
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,329
It was a sweep.

999
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:07,470
Destroyed it.

1000
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:12,460
Mother the transition.

1001
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1002
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:20,590
I'm sorry.

1003
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,590
Just fucking hold on a second here.

1004
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,210
Hold on.

1005
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,210
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1006
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,210
Slow down.

1007
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:29,180
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1008
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:43,539
Shmee.

1009
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:44,539
Yeah.

1010
01:09:44,539 --> 01:09:45,539
No, that was that was hard.

1011
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:46,539
It was very, very hard.

1012
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:52,510
Doing Jevil was I there was two or three times during that play

1013
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,510
through what I was like.

1014
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,510
Hopefully you know when you're about to do something really,

1015
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:58,510
really cool and you about you almost drop the ball.

1016
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,510
It's like the egg walking contest.

1017
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,510
When you get to the very end, you see the finish line.

1018
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,510
You have the egg in your hand and you're about to drop it.

1019
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,510
You drop the egg on the ground right when you touch the finish line

1020
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:07,510
and it breaks and you lose.

1021
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:10,510
I thought that was going to happen during the Jevil thing and it was

1022
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:13,510
going to be such a disappointment because I was so close.

1023
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,130
Worst gaming moment of the year.

1024
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:22,609
So did we lose like we actually gained viewers.

1025
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:25,609
I thought that during the Peter thing that we were going to lose

1026
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:26,609
a shitload.

1027
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:28,880
That's not an analogy.

1028
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,880
That's not a worst analogy.

1029
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:42,039
By the way, worst analogy had one nomination and it was and it was

1030
01:10:42,039 --> 01:10:47,039
the stupid analogy thing that I have not drunk this coffee in here.

1031
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:49,039
Look, you want me to prove it.

1032
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:51,039
Oh, there's nothing in there anymore.

1033
01:10:51,039 --> 01:11:03,359
Fuck.

1034
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,359
I can't spill.

1035
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:07,359
Also, I forgot to laugh at the fact that I'm wearing the same fucking

1036
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,359
blazer that I was wearing during the green screen stream.

1037
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:12,239
This is coffee.

1038
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,239
It's not alcohol.

1039
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,539
I just had a little bit of an issue there.

1040
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:16,539
All right.

1041
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:18,539
So anyways, I don't remember what the fuck I was saying.

1042
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:19,539
I don't have one seat.

1043
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:21,539
You don't need more than one suit.

1044
01:11:21,539 --> 01:11:23,539
You know how much it is to have a rack of suits in your fucking

1045
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:24,539
closet.

1046
01:11:24,539 --> 01:11:25,539
It's like six grand.

1047
01:11:25,539 --> 01:11:28,539
No, this was like this was like two hundred and forty five dollars.

1048
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:31,539
And I got a long time ago when I was like 14.

1049
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:34,539
That's why you see it still fits me.

1050
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:42,050
I don't got to get a new suit for what?

1051
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,229
Anywho, we're going to do the worst gamer moment of the year.

1052
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:48,229
And there were a bunch of best gamer moments.

1053
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:51,229
And sure enough, yes, there were a lot of worst gamer moments as

1054
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:52,229
well.

1055
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:55,229
Way more worst gamer moments than best gamer moments.

1056
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:56,229
But that's OK.

1057
01:11:56,229 --> 01:12:01,640
Let's take a look at the nominees for worst gaming moment of the

1058
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:10,369
year.

1059
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:24,840
Right.

1060
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,479
The game that game called my spelling wrong.

1061
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:31,789
Law.

1062
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:32,789
The law and order game.

1063
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:36,789
But you point at people and scream at them.

1064
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:41,869
Objection.

1065
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:42,869
What?

1066
01:12:42,869 --> 01:12:43,869
I don't.

1067
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:45,239
I've never played one.

1068
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,239
What?

1069
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,239
Destiny's law.

1070
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:49,239
Destiny's child.

1071
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:52,199
Dear.

1072
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:54,600
Oh my God.

1073
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,600
It's a guy's first and last name.

1074
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,600
It's called like Professor Layton.

1075
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,079
What is his name?

1076
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,079
It's the character's name.

1077
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:07,079
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

1078
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,699
A cat in the hat.

1079
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:10,699
What is this?

1080
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:11,699
All right.

1081
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:14,600
Watch this.

1082
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:23,779
You don't think I'm stupid.

1083
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:27,770
What?

1084
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,909
I'm what happened?

1085
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:31,909
What?

1086
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:32,909
That's not a door.

1087
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,909
What?

1088
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:34,909
Why did this not open?

1089
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:37,239
What?

1090
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:38,989
What?

1091
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:39,989
Why did the door?

1092
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:40,989
I walked right into it.

1093
01:13:40,989 --> 01:13:43,119
I don't understand.

1094
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,119
What the fuck did I just do?

1095
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:46,119
No, no, no, no, no.

1096
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:47,119
What?

1097
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:49,899
What the fuck did I just do?

1098
01:13:49,899 --> 01:13:50,899
Did I just go back?

1099
01:13:50,899 --> 01:13:51,899
I just pressed.

1100
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:52,899
No fucking way.

1101
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:55,420
Put it in there.

1102
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,420
You know, there's nothing.

1103
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,420
There's enough stuff in these.

1104
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:01,479
Where are the diamonds, motherfucker?

1105
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,479
I can't get him in the gut.

1106
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,479
Why is this guy so good at fighting?

1107
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:04,479
Is this guy just really good at this?

1108
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:05,479
Why is this guy so good?

1109
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,920
Give me a knife.

1110
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,720
Give me a, give me a.

1111
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,720
I'm cutting his fucking head off.

1112
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:18,960
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1113

He's gonna fucking kill me.

1124
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:48,880
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1125
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1126
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,880
He's gonna fucking kill me.

01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,529
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1128
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:54,529
He's gonna fucking kill me.

01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:56,529
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1131
01:14:56,529 --> 01:15:03,720
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1132
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:07,970
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1133
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,970
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1134
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:10,340
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1135
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,340
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1136
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,340
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1137
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,399

Uh.

1143
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,720
Yeah.

1144
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,090
Sure.

1145
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:56,340
I'm so dirty.

1146
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:57,340
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1147
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,340

01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:27,289
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1165
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:28,289
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:29,529
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1176
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:42,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1177
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1179
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:45,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1180
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,750
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1181
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,239
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1182
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,800
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1183
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,800
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1184
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,800
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1185
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,800
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1186
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,800
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1187
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,750
ho ho, ho ho ho boy.

1188
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,949
I swear to god!

1189
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,630
I've done dumb things before.

1190
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:17,140
I fall in a fucking clutch.

1191
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:21,859
I forgot just how fucking embarrassing that Red Dead Redemption 2, I thought the

1192
01:17:21,859 --> 01:17:23,619
The Stole Your Gun thing was, holy shit!

1193
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:33,130
That's the first time I've seen that back since I think streaming that game.

1194
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,619
Wow!

1195
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:53,729
Anyways, the worst gaming moment of the year is going to go to, with 22% of the vote,

1196
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:59,659
dying to a creeper in Minecraft.

1197
01:17:59,659 --> 01:18:03,020
Dying to a creeper in Minecraft wins.

1198
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:08,779
I was shit-faced on one of the last streams at my old house,

1199
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:13,590
and I played Minecraft for 10 minutes and I was looking at a wall and died to a creeper.

1200
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:16,590
That's the worst thing I've ever done this year?

1201
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:25,569
It's a creeper? Is it that? Is it that? That's a huge problem, apparently.

1202
01:18:25,569 --> 01:18:30,260
Dying to a creeper in 2018 and hearing the hiss and not doing anything about it.

1203
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,260
I was shit-faced. That doesn't... What?

1204
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:40,489
A recount. We can't do a recount now. It's too late.

1205
01:18:40,489 --> 01:18:44,489
We only got 30 minutes to go until the ball drops.

1206
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:47,489
I've got to get a song ready. Hold on a minute here.

1207
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:51,069
Here comes a stall.

1208
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:53,069
Let me get a good song. What's it called?

1209
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:57,149
Old Lang Syne?

1210
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,149
I need to get a ball drop behind me.

1211
01:18:59,149 --> 01:19:02,350
Hold on. Just wait, wait, wait.

1212
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:04,979
I've got to make sure I get the right one.

1213
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:06,979
I've got to have a ball drop.

1214
01:19:06,979 --> 01:19:11,109
I'll get it. Just hold on. I've got my computer here.

1215
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:14,739
I mean, you know that I have the computer here.

1216
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:18,579
How do you spell Old Lang Syne?

1217
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:30,970
A-U-D-L-O-A-U-L-D-L-A-N-G-S-Y-N-E.

1218
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:31,970
There it is. Got it.

1219
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:35,340
Okay, make sure we've got this queued up.

1220
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,340
And then I need a ball drop in here.

1221
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:42,619
So let's go with ball drop.

1222
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:46,880
I wonder if I can get a ball drop.

1223
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:52,789
Well, these are balls, technically.

1224
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,350
They are technically balls.

1225
01:19:56,350 --> 01:20:00,550
But they're not the correct kind of balls.

1226
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:01,550
They'll have to do.

1227
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:07,250
Let me just get those queued up real quick.

1228
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,250
We've got the best categories coming up.

1229
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,420
We've got worst stream of the year.

1230
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,420
We have worst category. We have worst breakdown.

1231
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:16,420
Worst joke, best joke.

1232
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:26,149
You're going to want to stick around for those ones.

1233
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:27,149
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1234
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:28,149
We've got 30 minutes.

1235
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:29,149
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1236
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:31,029
We're good.

1237
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:34,029
Let me just add these media sources to make sure we...

1238
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,399
You know, don't do...

1239
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:45,229
Hold on. What is this?

1240
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:47,229
I'm going to have a couple of doctors here.

1241
01:20:47,229 --> 01:20:48,229
Hold on.

1242
01:20:48,229 --> 01:21:04,100
Somebody's going to think these are real people here.

1243
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:12,619
Look, I'm here with my friends.

1244
01:21:12,619 --> 01:21:13,619
I've got my friends here.

1245
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,619
We're all doctors here.

1246
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:19,710
Okay, prove how tall you are.

1247
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,340
Oh, yeah. I'll prove how tall I am.

1248
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:28,340
The name of this clip was called Six Foot Doctor and 5'11 Doctor.

1249
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,340
You know what I'm saying?

1250
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:40,069
Let's make sure they're in the right spot.

1251
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:42,020
See?

1252
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:43,020
They don't even come close.

1253
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:48,500
Y'all go stand right next to them.

1254
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:57,979
That makes me so much smaller.

1255
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:01,979
I didn't think about that.

1256
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:11,109
It's okay.

1257
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:12,109
I'm going to put them over here.

1258
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:13,109
They make more sense right here.

1259
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:16,020
Let me see.

1260
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,020
What the fuck are you working on over here?

1261
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,659
What does it say?

1262
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:23,659
January 23, 2019?

1263
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:27,500
Fucking book.

1264
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,920
I forget what I was even doing.

1265
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,920
Oh, right. I was getting the ball drop.

1266
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:43,140
Ball drop.

1267
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:45,140
I can't have this play on screen yet, so I've got to be careful.

1268
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:52,609
Hold on.

1269
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:54,609
I'll just play this song for you.

1270
01:22:54,609 --> 01:22:59,710
Just listen to this for a little while.

1271
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,710
You know what? While I do this...

1272
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,710
No, I can't do that. I was going to play the worst sounds again.

1273
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:08,699
There we go. Here it comes.

1274
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:11,140
I just don't want you to see it yet because

1275
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,140
it's the only ball drop I can get that's like a royalty-free ball drop.

1276
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:17,550
That's in the right place.

1277
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:23,039
All right.

1278
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,039
Almost ready. Almost ready.

1279
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:27,039
I just need an old Lang sign.

1280
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,369
Just wait. I'm telling you, it's going to be worth your time.

1281
01:23:30,369 --> 01:23:32,739
There it is.

1282
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,739
All right, I'm good.

1283
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:36,739
The next category is worst category.

1284
01:23:36,739 --> 01:23:40,619
No, don't play it yet.

1285
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:42,619
Don't play it.

1286
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:55,489
It's not time for this yet.

1287
01:23:55,489 --> 01:24:08,850
Is this the right song?

1288
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,850
Okay, that's the right song.

1289
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:13,220
All right.

1290
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:15,220
The next category is worst category.

1291
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:18,930
This one's not going to take very long

1292
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:22,829
because the worst category...

1293
01:24:22,829 --> 01:24:26,100
Let's take a look what they are.

1294
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,100
Yes, I am well aware that this looks like

1295
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,100
a protein bar company logo,

1296
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,810
but that's fine.

1297
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:35,810
You got worst beater, best beater, worst category,

1298
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:37,810
best ice cream flavor,

1299
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:39,810
worst overall stream, and worst hair.

1300
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:44,989
Everyone thought these were the worst.

1301
01:24:44,989 --> 01:24:46,989
I would probably agree with you.

1302
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:50,060
Worst category.

1303
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,579
And the worst category...

1304
01:24:53,579 --> 01:24:55,579
That just scared the shit out of me.

1305
01:24:55,579 --> 01:24:57,579
I thought these were real people.

1306
01:24:57,579 --> 01:24:59,819
I thought they were real people standing behind me

1307
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:05,140
and I was like, how the fuck did they get in here?

1308
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,140
And the winner

1309
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,380
of the 2018 worst category

1310
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,380
of the worst category

1311
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,380
with 33% of the vote

1312
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,380
is...

1313
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:18,130
this one.

1314
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:20,130
Worst category.

1315
01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:25,890
That's the worst category.

1316
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,890
It wasn't as funny as I thought it was going to be

1317
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:31,149
What like filler

1318
01:25:31,149 --> 01:25:35,310
for the rest of the fucking stream?

1319
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:37,310
33% of the vote, but

1320
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:39,869
okay.

1321
01:25:39,869 --> 01:25:41,869
That's the worst category and I spent the time

1322
01:25:41,869 --> 01:25:43,869
writing on this too.

1323
01:25:43,869 --> 01:25:45,869
Take a look at that. Put that over there.

1324
01:25:45,869 --> 01:25:48,689
Like take a look at this one. See?

1325
01:25:48,689 --> 01:25:51,890
It's funny because it's meta.

1326
01:25:51,890 --> 01:26:00,779
Is somebody taking a shower?

1327
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:06,930
No, that's applause. Okay.

1328
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,939
Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the

1329
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:11,939
meaty meat and potatoes of the award

1330
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:13,939
ceremony stream.

1331
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:17,069
Only got one, two,

1332
01:26:17,069 --> 01:26:19,069
three, four

1333
01:26:19,069 --> 01:26:21,069
more categories remaining. These are big ones.

1334
01:26:21,069 --> 01:26:23,069
So we're going to have to get a couple more bananas over here.

1335
01:26:23,069 --> 01:26:34,590
Somebody said hurry up!

1336
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:41,300
Sorry, I tapped it there.

1337
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,300
So I got four.

1338
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,300
Why don't I have a clap

1339
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,380
emote? Why don't I have a clap

1340
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:54,430
emote? Alright, we got

1341
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:56,430
just over 25 minutes or so

1342
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:58,800
until the new year

1343
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,800
eastern time. And let me peek at this one.

1344
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,710
Ooh, okay. The nominees

1345
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:07,710
this is worst breakdown

1346
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:09,949
on stream. To give you a little

1347
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:11,949
bit of context, worst

1348
01:27:11,949 --> 01:27:13,949
breakdown is any time that I actually got truly

1349
01:27:13,949 --> 01:27:16,319
upset or

1350
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:18,319
not joking around, you know, like

1351
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:20,319
oh, I can't believe I just got killed

1352
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:22,319
there. No, no, no, like real actual

1353
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,840
breakdown. Caught on

1354
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,590
camera. Here are the nominees for worst breakdown

1355
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:33,840
of the year. Yeah, sorry

1356
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
I don't have 50 hours at

1357
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,840
Mario Tennis. And you know what?

1358
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
I ain't going to lose very much sleep from being

1359
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,840
bad at Mario Tennis. I don't think

1360
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,840
that's going to affect me very much. I don't

1361
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
think that's going to be a big deal. I'm just

1362
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,840
painting all day like I'm

1363
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,840
fucking fuming right now. Like I

1364
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,840
am so unreasonably

1365
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,840
angry right now. I have to restart. I should have just

1366
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,840
fucking, I should have just bought

1367
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,840
Breath of the Fucking Wild.

1368
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,399
What? Are you serious?

1369
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:02,399
Holy shit, there's a button, there's a B in here.

1370
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,399
Oh, fuck me. Goodbye. Tell me if it's in

1371
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,399
here. I'm going to leave the room for like a minute.

1372
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:09,470
Tell me if it's in here, for real. I'll be back

1373
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:11,470
in like a minute. Tell me if it's actually in here.

1374
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:15,300
It's real, it's real.

1375
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:17,300
It's there, right there. As

1376
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,300
stupid as this level is

1377
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,300
and it's just like, hey, I have an idea.

1378
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,300
Let's just like make it impossible.

1379
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,300
It's the only level in

1380
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,300
the entire two game

1381
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,300
series where you can't

1382
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,300
walk out of the door. In the whole

1383
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,300
two game series.

1384
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,300
Fuck that stupid item.

1385
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Do you see how many times I swung over or

1386
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,300
through somebody? Like, oh my god.

1387
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,300
Only use that for bosses. For any reason. Don't ever do it.

1388
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:43,300
Ever. Only use this weapon because it's good.

1389
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,300
This is a good weapon.

1390
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,789
It doesn't take three seconds to swing and you go

1391
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:49,789
let me swing over your head. Whoa.

1392
01:28:49,789 --> 01:28:51,789
Did you duck for a second? Let me just, whoa.

1393
01:28:51,789 --> 01:28:53,789
Swing around like a fucking yo-yo.

1394
01:28:53,789 --> 01:28:55,789
Oh my god, that weapon eats ass.

1395
01:28:55,789 --> 01:29:19,090
Wait, I'm alive.

1396
01:29:19,090 --> 01:29:21,090
I'm alive, I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive.

1397
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:23,090
No, don't eat that.

1398
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:25,090
He's confused.

1399
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,859
He's confused.

1400
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:30,859
So am I. He's like, I don't know what

1401
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:32,859
you want me to do, dude.

1402
01:29:32,859 --> 01:29:34,859
Wait, hold on.

1403
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:36,859
Hey, hey.

1404
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:38,859
Hey, lights and camera and action.

1405
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,310
I fucking need to turn these two off.

1406
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,550
Uh, so

1407
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:03,789
best breakdown of the year

1408
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:10,000
is, you could have seen

1409
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,350
this one coming.

1410
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,350
Worst breakdown of 2018

1411
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:18,979
with

1412
01:30:18,979 --> 01:30:20,979
30% of the vote, the Wasp encounter.

1413
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:26,529
The Wasps.

1414
01:30:26,529 --> 01:30:28,529
Worst breakdown of, that's

1415
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:30,529
yeah, I would argue

1416
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:32,529
Mario Tennis was more anger.

1417
01:30:32,529 --> 01:30:34,529
I mean, which one was more of a breakdown

1418
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,109
though, I wonder.

1419
01:30:38,109 --> 01:30:40,109
Mario Tennis is also, by the way, up for

1420
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:42,109
worst stream of the year.

1421
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:45,890
Just in case you were wondering.

1422
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:55,550
30% of the vote for the Wasps.

1423
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,430
Okay. Oh, boy.

1424
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:00,430
Do you see what we got

1425
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:02,430
here?

1426
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,430
We've only got the last three

1427
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,430
categories. We've got

1428
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:08,430
worst overall stream, best joke

1429
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:10,430
taking more than five minutes, worst joke

1430
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,430
taking more than five minutes. We're down,

1431
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:14,430
we're almost ready to count down the new year.

1432
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:21,020
Add more doctors.

1433
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:26,779
You know, that's important. Let's get a couple more

1434
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:37,979
doctors. Now, is this the

1435
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:39,979
only doctor that's on a green screen?

1436
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:42,670
Hold on, hold on.

1437
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:44,670
Doctors green screen.

1438
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,670
Excuse me, doctors surrounding me.

1439
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,680
What the fuck is this?

1440
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:51,680
Okay, hold on. Oh, no.

1441
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,680
Oh, no, this is not.

1442
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,050
This is what we're doing.

1443
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:58,050
There's so fucking many of these. These are like

1444
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,050
character selection screen people.

1445
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:03,550
You'll see what I mean in a second.

1446
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,550
Are you ready for like choose your doctor

1447
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:13,420
character in a video game?

1448
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,420
Let's get this one, this

1449
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:19,390
one. Let's get like four

1450
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:21,390
more. That one's creepy. Let's get this one

1451
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:27,020
too. And I'm gonna get like

1452
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:29,710
a hospital in the background.

1453
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,079
Why am I? No, this is an award

1454
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,319
show. This is not like

1455
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:36,319
Dick around for. Yeah, maybe actually kind of is.

1456
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,069
Alright, let's get these ones

1457
01:32:39,069 --> 01:33:01,600
added. Alright,

1458
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:14,020
color key them in.

1459
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,340
Alright, you go back here.

1460
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:21,949
He's huge. He's actually

1461
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:24,640
kind of small now. Alright,

1462
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:38,659
get a couple others.

1463
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:41,090
You can be a little bit taller up here.

1464
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:47,550
Where'd you go? Oh, right.

1465
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:49,550
All these doctors are so concerned.

1466
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:51,550
Actually, I kind of want to be like back here too.

1467
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:53,550
Like there's some 3D space going on.

1468
01:33:53,550 --> 01:34:04,939
And put the. No, I'm not putting the tent up

1469
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,939
again. I had a breakdown

1470
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:08,939
from that one. Okay.

1471
01:34:08,939 --> 01:34:12,020
There's another one. We got one more.

1472
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:14,020
I think I got one more doctor to put up here.

1473
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:17,710
Wait, what?

1474
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:19,710
This is the same doctor. Now I need one more

1475
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:22,909
other doctor. Put up the fucking

1476
01:34:22,909 --> 01:34:29,180
tent. God damn it.

1477
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,180
Alright, let me put the tent up.

1478
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:38,420
It's the end of the night anyway, so

1479
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:47,439
hold on. There's a couple others

1480
01:34:47,439 --> 01:35:03,420
here.

1481
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:10,270
I hate this. I need a different

1482
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:12,270
background. I gotta go get like a forest background.

1483
01:35:12,270 --> 01:35:15,340
Put the guy with the needle

1484
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,340
in the front. Why do you want

1485
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,340
the guy with the needle in the front?

1486
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:25,359
I don't even know which one he is.

1487
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:27,359
I have so many sources. You have no idea.

1488
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,939
There's like 30 sources. I don't know

1489
01:35:30,939 --> 01:35:32,939
which one he is. I don't even know where the ball drop is.

1490
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:37,229
No, that's an old Lang Syne.

1491
01:35:37,229 --> 01:35:39,229
I'm not ready for that yet. It's

1492
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:41,229
1143

1493
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:43,229
Eastern.

1494
01:35:43,229 --> 01:35:46,050
Not yet. I need a

1495
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:51,359
forest. I want one more

1496
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:53,359
doctor in the forest. This one's

1497
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,260
good. And then we're ready

1498
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,260
to go, you know what I mean? We're ready for the ball

1499
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,260
drop in the forest with a bunch

1500
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,270
of fucking doctors. Why is

1501
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:06,270
there a bunch of doctors in the forest? That's why I'm celebrating

1502
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:09,149
my New Year's Eve party.

1503
01:36:09,149 --> 01:36:11,149
So where is that one?

1504
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:17,539
This is called a handsome

1505
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:20,289
friend?

1506
01:36:20,289 --> 01:36:24,380
Handsome friend doctor.

1507
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,619
This one talks. Is he saying

1508
01:36:26,619 --> 01:36:29,890
anything? What's he saying?

1509
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:42,939
Is he talking? Almost done.

1510
01:36:42,939 --> 01:36:45,890
He's inside the tent

1511
01:36:45,890 --> 01:37:00,079
right now.

1512
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:02,079
Replace me.

1513
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:07,390
Okay, this is getting fucking

1514
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:12,060
weird. Hold on. I gotta

1515
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,060
bring that guy up

1516
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,060
a little bit. No? There we go.

1517
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:23,550
Which one?

1518
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,369
Where is this guy?

1519
01:37:26,369 --> 01:37:30,340
Where is

1520
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,659
this guy?

1521
01:37:33,659 --> 01:37:35,659
Make needle guy huge in the front. I'd love to

1522
01:37:35,659 --> 01:37:37,659
find out which one of these sources he is.

1523
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:40,989
Handsome doctor. Thoughtful

1524
01:37:40,989 --> 01:37:53,329
doctor. No?

1525
01:37:53,329 --> 01:37:55,329
I don't know where the fuck. I don't know where he is. What time is it?

1526
01:37:55,329 --> 01:37:57,329
Okay, we got 15 minutes. Hold on.

1527
01:37:57,329 --> 01:38:08,399
No, that's me. No! I need him.

1528
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,399
There he is. Finally.

1529
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:17,680
I'm just like back here.

1530
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,680
Okay, I'm okay being back here like

1531
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:26,020
hanging out. Okay, I need a forest

1532
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:28,020
quick. Forest, forest, forest, forest,

1533
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:30,189
forest, forest, forest.

1534
01:38:30,189 --> 01:38:32,189
Anyone of you guys know why you get a forest around

1535
01:38:32,189 --> 01:38:35,760
here? Forest.

1536
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,760
Images. Whatever the first one is doesn't matter. Right here.

1537
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:46,020
Does this have like a, I think this might have

1538
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,020
This is like AccuWeather. What?

1539
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:52,880
I'm almost done. We're so close.

1540
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:59,409
Alright, I'm almost there.

1541
01:38:59,409 --> 01:39:02,739
Got it. Got it.

1542
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:06,189
Got it. Right there.

1543
01:39:06,189 --> 01:39:08,189
Get it on the desktop. It's called got it.

1544
01:39:08,189 --> 01:39:20,850
Here we go. I'm ready for the new year. Holy shit.

1545
01:39:20,850 --> 01:39:22,850
That's such a tiny image. Why is it

1546
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:34,939
so small? This just doesn't fit though.

1547
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:36,939
That kind of does. I'm like the

1548
01:39:36,939 --> 01:39:43,920
head doctor. This guy

1549
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,920
is taking up my fucking limelight here. Get out of

1550
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:51,149
the way. That's better.

1551
01:39:51,149 --> 01:39:53,329
Alright, the nominees

1552
01:39:53,329 --> 01:39:55,329
for best

1553
01:39:55,329 --> 01:39:57,329
joke taking more than five

1554
01:39:57,329 --> 01:40:01,170
minutes to set up. We're getting close.

1555
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:06,479
Best joke taking more than five minutes

1556
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,550
to set up here are your nominees.

1557
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:25,630
They taste like cotton candy.

1558
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:27,630
I'm all over.

1559
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,630
Gus, I got bad news for you.

1560
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:31,630
There's only one sex. I'm turning this

1561
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:33,630
off. I'm gonna fuck out of here.

1562
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,630
I had to get rescued by two other balloons.

1563
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:37,630
You guys know when you go

1564
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:39,630
on a cruise ship

1565
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:41,630
and the cruise ship goes around

1566
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:43,630
and you get to the certain waters where

1567
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,630
you can play casino games,

1568
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:47,630
there's no loss up there.

1569
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:49,630
When you get to 5,000

1570
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:51,630
feet in the air, there's no loss anymore.

1571
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:55,470
I got stuck.

1572
01:40:55,470 --> 01:41:06,479
Hold on. This is kind of

1573
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:09,170
cool looking though. Look out there,

1574
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:11,409
man. It actually looks really

1575
01:41:11,409 --> 01:41:13,579
good on the 3DS.

1576
01:41:13,579 --> 01:41:15,579
I ordered a few pizzas. So I ordered

1577
01:41:15,579 --> 01:41:17,579
pizzas. And then you left and you didn't

1578
01:41:17,579 --> 01:41:19,579
pick up the bill. Okay, and the bill was

1579
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:21,579
$100,000 fucking dollars.

1580
01:41:21,579 --> 01:41:23,579
The U-Haul trucks show up full of pizzas.

1581
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,579
Okay.

1582
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,579
So this is what we're talking about now.

1583
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:29,579
He wants the almighty dollar.

1584
01:41:29,579 --> 01:41:31,579
This is what he's here for.

1585
01:41:31,579 --> 01:41:33,579
He's here for money.

1586
01:41:33,579 --> 01:41:35,579
Oh shit.

1587
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:37,579
Don't go to the top row.

1588
01:41:37,579 --> 01:41:40,270
Please don't go to the top row. I can't take it.

1589
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:42,270
I can't take it.

1590
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:44,829
Oh shit.

1591
01:41:44,829 --> 01:41:46,829
Don't go to the top row.

1592
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:48,829
Kill please.

1593
01:41:48,829 --> 01:41:50,829
I'll do anything for the top row.

1594
01:41:50,829 --> 01:41:52,829
Oh shit.

1595
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:14,020
Dad just lives in the walls.

1596
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,640
Imagine if Mrs. Doubtfire, instead of

1597
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,640
I want to get back with my family,

1598
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,640
I'm going to dress up as like an old lady

1599
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:24,640
and be their nanny. It's

1600
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,640
I'm going to build a house in their house

1601
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,640
and listen to them and try to talk to them

1602
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,640
through the walls and stuff.

1603
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,640
Wall dad.

1604
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,640
Everyone keeps asking about it. I'm not going to answer that question.

1605
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,640
It's very lewd and disrespectful.

1606
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,569
12 inches.

1607
01:42:39,569 --> 01:42:41,810
Yeah.

1608
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:43,810
I think it's truthful.

1609
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:45,810
See.

1610
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:47,810
I don't even need any more questions.

1611
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:49,810
That's it.

1612
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:51,810
Do you understand? Do you understand

1613
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:53,810
I don't need any more questions after that one?

1614
01:42:53,810 --> 01:43:08,460
This time it wasn't

1615
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:10,460
I had the headphones in. This time it's not the doctors

1616
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,460
that started me. It's the fucking noise

1617
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,460
that keeps playing every time I come back.

1618
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,460
Best joke

1619
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,460
of the year that took more than five minutes

1620
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,829
to set up. There was a lot of

1621
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:23,069
a lot of people went

1622
01:43:23,069 --> 01:43:25,069
into those jokes.

1623
01:43:25,069 --> 01:43:28,140
Why is a tent moving?

1624
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:30,140
I can't even do a serious

1625
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,140
like oh a lot of time went into some of those

1626
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,140
and they were a lot of fun.

1627
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,640
It's impossible to do like a

1628
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,640
hey let's do like a heart to heart with

1629
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:40,640
seven doctors in the room.

1630
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,640
And two people in a tent.

1631
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,640
So ladies and gentlemen the winner

1632
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,779
of the best joke of the year taking more than five minutes.

1633
01:43:47,779 --> 01:44:00,960
With 22% of the vote

1634
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,670
it is

1635
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:06,670
I didn't say anything yet. Wait stop.

1636
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:10,699
The hot air balloon to Las Vegas.

1637
01:44:10,699 --> 01:44:16,529
Hot air balloon

1638
01:44:16,529 --> 01:44:18,529
to Las Vegas.

1639
01:44:18,529 --> 01:44:22,300
22% of the vote. Clap doctors

1640
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:30,239
clap.

1641
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,989
Why am I getting booed?

1642
01:44:32,989 --> 01:44:34,989
I don't hear any booze. Do you hear booze

1643
01:44:34,989 --> 01:44:36,989
here? I don't hear any booze.

1644
01:44:36,989 --> 01:44:38,989
Do you? Do you hear booze?

1645
01:44:38,989 --> 01:44:41,300
Any of you?

1646
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:43,859
Do you hear?

1647
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:54,210
I don't hear any booze at all.

1648
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:56,210
That took a long time

1649
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:58,640
to do. It took a lot of patience

1650
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,640
from a lot of people that had no idea

1651
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:02,640
what the fuck I was even doing so

1652
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,970
I'll take this. I'll take fucking two

1653
01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:13,140
of them for that. So with the best comes

1654
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,590
the worst. The worst

1655
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:18,590
joke of the year taking more than five

1656
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:24,539
minutes to set up. Peek the mic.

1657
01:45:24,539 --> 01:45:28,640
I'm not going to peek the mic.

1658
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,640
The nominees for worst

1659
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,880
joke of the year.

1660
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,399
This one. This one. This one. You can't

1661
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:38,399
make that joke.

1662
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:41,020
I haven't had enough time.

1663
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,020
Look, at 12.01 Eastern

1664
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,020
time I'm going to scream into the microphone so

1665
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,020
you can guarantee you'd have something for next year.

1666
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:51,380
The worst joke taking more than five

1667
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:53,380
minutes to set up for 2018, here are your

1668
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,739
nominees. The worst joke

1669
01:45:55,739 --> 01:46:00,020
of the year.

1670
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:03,600
Do we have to start?

1671
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,600
I don't want to break this. This is going to a

1672
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:11,359
library, god damn it.

1673
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:17,310
Let's get a straight track.

1674
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:19,310
He just went like

1675
01:46:19,310 --> 01:46:21,310
this.

1676
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:30,140
He just went like this.

1677
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:34,050
Shit.

1678
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:36,050
Facecam. Oh my god fine.

1679
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:38,050
Jesus Christ.

1680
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:45,729
That was fucking ridiculous.

1681
01:46:45,729 --> 01:46:49,949
I got

1682
01:46:49,949 --> 01:46:52,189
these bags though.

1683
01:46:52,189 --> 01:46:54,939
Whatever. No fingerprints, no witnesses.

1684
01:46:54,939 --> 01:46:57,380
Nothing. I'll let you know when it

1685
01:46:57,380 --> 01:46:59,380
turns up. Alright fucking bye.

1686
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:02,510
Bye.

1687
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:04,510
If I can't see where I'm going I will end up in

1688
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:06,510
a vault somewhere.

1689
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:08,510
Most people will never know

1690
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:10,510
anything beyond what they see with

1691
01:47:10,510 --> 01:47:12,510
their own two eyes.

1692
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,510
Awful movie.

1693
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:18,859
Because most people will never know

1694
01:47:18,859 --> 01:47:20,859
anything beyond what they see

1695
01:47:20,859 --> 01:47:22,859
with their own two eyes.

1696
01:47:22,859 --> 01:47:24,859
I did it exactly. I didn't even need to watch

1697
01:47:24,859 --> 01:47:27,420
the movie. Somebody clip it

1698
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:29,420
then. Somebody show me that clip

1699
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:31,420
of me saying that and then we'll play them at the same time.

1700
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:36,590
That's not it.

1701
01:47:36,590 --> 01:47:38,590
I don't think anybody has it.

1702
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:41,220
Let me turn this up.

1703
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,220
This is very important. It's an incredibly important

1704
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:46,989
part of the story.

1705
01:47:46,989 --> 01:47:48,989
B clip. Alright never mind.

1706
01:47:48,989 --> 01:47:50,989
Wait.

1707
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:55,010
Someone's got it. Not the clip.

1708
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:58,460
We're not doing that again.

1709
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,460
I can just do it right now.

1710
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,460
Why do I need a clip? Why do I need

1711
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:04,460
audio from in the past?

1712
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:06,460
I can just do it now. Most people

1713
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:08,460
will never know anything beyond what they

1714
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,460
see with their own two eyes.

1715
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,460
No. That sucks.

1716
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:14,460
I'm not doing that. I didn't have effort in

1717
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:17,220
that one. No.

1718
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:19,220
Yikes. No. That's it.

1719
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:21,220
That's it. We're going back to playing Spiderman 8.

1720
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:28,109
To the right.

1721
01:48:28,109 --> 01:48:30,109
This is just like bringing a couch into somebody's house.

1722
01:48:30,109 --> 01:48:32,420
I don't want to have to turn it upside down.

1723
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:36,500
He's out.

1724
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,890
He's out. Okay. Let the games begin.

1725
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:42,510
Don't want to get him stuck against a wall.

1726
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,819
Oh this.

1727
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:46,819
I didn't do that. Somebody got really impatient

1728
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:51,039
behind me. What do you mean riot?

1729
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:55,840
What are you rioting for?

1730
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
560 fucking meters.

1731
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:04,239
That was a good movement.

1732
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,670
That was nice and fluid.

1733
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:09,680
Try to get that again.

1734
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,680
Good volley. Good volley. Good volley.

1735
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:18,850
Oh. Perfect volley.

1736
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:20,850
It's too dark. It's too dark. Better view.

1737
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,850
We're going to wait for daytime.

1738
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:35,760
Oh shit. He's going to fall.

1739
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,760
He hits. Water hits here.

1740
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,760
And what does it do?

1741
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,760
Bang. Bang. Bang. Blah.

1742
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,760
All over the floor. Oh that's great.

1743
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,760
Splashes back. Gets all over you. Gets all over

1744
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,760
your shoes. And then you're stepping.

1745
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,760
Here's another problem. When you go

1746
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,760
into a public bathroom and you walk up to one of these fucking

1747
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,760
like tank urinals

1748
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,760
you're stepping

1749
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,760
in a dozen

1750
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,760
people's piss.

1751
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,760
Leg here and leg here.

1752
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:03,760
This is somebody standing here. Right?

1753
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,140
This

1754
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:10,590
has a trough. Guess what happens

1755
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:12,590
if the leak drips down here?

1756
01:50:12,590 --> 01:50:14,590
Oh what's that? It catches down here and it's angled.

1757
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:19,329
Goes right down in the hole.

1758
01:50:19,329 --> 01:50:21,329
Not going down here. Not going on here.

1759
01:50:21,329 --> 01:50:23,500
Going here.

1760
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:34,130
Hey! Okay.

1761
01:50:34,130 --> 01:50:36,130
Worst joke taken more than we

1762
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:38,130
have less than speaking. I will do this

1763
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,130
after. Ladies and gentlemen we got

1764
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:42,130
two minutes until

1765
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:44,130
these people are freaking me out. Two minutes

1766
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:46,130
countdown until

1767
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,130
New Year's Eve. New Year's Day.

1768
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:51,840
1201. It is

1769
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:53,840
currently just under

1770
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,779
midnight. This is the last

1771
01:50:56,779 --> 01:50:58,779
thing you're going to see in 2018.

1772
01:50:58,779 --> 01:51:01,220
Are you ready?

1773
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:03,649
Hold on. I gotta make sure I'm ready.

1774
01:51:03,649 --> 01:51:06,399
I gotta get bigger. Wrong

1775
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:08,399
person

1776
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:10,399
to make bigger. There I am.

1777
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:15,970
Alright. Get me in the fucking front please.

1778
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:20,510
Okay. Here we are.

1779
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:25,550
Here we are. What do we got?

1780
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:27,920
One minute. Where's old Langstein?

1781
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,920
Where is it? And where's the ball drop?

1782
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,920
Oh shit. I think. Is this the ball drop?

1783
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:34,350
No. Okay. That's old Langstein. Where's the ball drop?

1784
01:51:34,350 --> 01:51:36,850
There it is. Okay.

1785
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:38,850
That's gotta go up in the front. All the way.

1786
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:42,300
Alright. How loud is that? It's gonna be loud.

1787
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:46,659
30 seconds.

1788
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:53,300
30 seconds.

1789
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,859
30 seconds. Not even.

1790
01:51:55,859 --> 01:52:01,039
Let's start the countdown. 10.

1791
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:03,279
No. 20. 25.

1792
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:05,279
20.

1793
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:07,279
19.

1794
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:09,279
18. 17.

1795
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:11,279
Why am I getting. I'm like losing enthusiasm.

1796
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:13,279
17.

1797
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:15,649
10. 9.

1798
01:52:15,649 --> 01:52:17,649
8. 7.

1799
01:52:17,649 --> 01:52:19,649
6. 5.

1800
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:21,649
4. 3.

1801
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:23,649
2. 1. There it is.

1802
01:52:23,649 --> 01:52:25,649
Happy New Year. The ball's dropping.

1803
01:52:25,649 --> 01:52:29,550
The ball dropped.

1804
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:33,649
Happy New Year.

1805
01:52:33,649 --> 01:52:37,739
What's wrong with this video file?

1806
01:52:37,739 --> 01:52:39,739
Oh. There it is. The ball dropped.

1807
01:52:39,739 --> 01:52:42,050
There it is.

1808
01:52:42,050 --> 01:52:44,050
Where's my source?

1809
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:46,050
Oh honey.

1810
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:48,050
Remember when we went to camp in the fucking woods?

1811
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:50,050
And we watched all those golf balls?

1812
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:52,739
Where am I?

1813
01:52:52,739 --> 01:52:56,109
There I am. Happy New Year

1814
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:58,109
Happy New Year everybody.

1815
01:52:58,109 --> 01:53:00,109
Have a good one.

1816
01:53:00,109 --> 01:53:03,060
Happy. We have a shitload of community subs

1817
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,060
just came in and I didn't even see them.

1818
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:07,060
Somebody. Big fat mistake.

1819
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:12,430
Gave 20 community subs. Happy New Year.

1820
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:14,430
It is now

1821
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:16,430
12.

1822
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:18,430
12.01.

1823
01:53:18,430 --> 01:53:21,310
Incoming.

1824
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:42,859
I just broke OBS.

1825
01:53:42,859 --> 01:53:44,859
Wasn't even loud? Hold on.

1826
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:47,869
Did I get

1827
01:53:47,869 --> 01:53:51,899
drowned out by old Langstein?

1828
01:53:51,899 --> 01:53:53,899
Holy shit. That's going to hurt somebody's ears.

1829
01:53:53,899 --> 01:54:00,430
Turn that down.

1830
01:54:00,430 --> 01:54:02,430
That hurt my chest doing that.

1831
01:54:02,430 --> 01:54:06,829
Does this thing still work?

1832
01:54:06,829 --> 01:54:08,829
Merry Christmas.

1833
01:54:08,829 --> 01:54:13,500
No. I'm not doing it louder than that.

1834
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,500
I'm sorry guys. I don't want to hurt anybody's ears.

1835
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:24,130
It wasn't loud?

1836
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:26,130
I don't want it to be loud.

1837
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:28,819
I don't want to do that to people.

1838
01:54:28,819 --> 01:54:30,819
Now I'm in the tent.

1839
01:54:30,819 --> 01:54:32,819
What are you guys doing in here?

1840
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:35,819
Oh sorry.

1841
01:54:35,819 --> 01:54:44,979
I put my fucking desk on you.

1842
01:54:44,979 --> 01:54:59,060
Yeah.

1843
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,060
I bring my laptop into the woods.

1844
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:03,060
I know the whole ruffin' it thing.

1845
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,060
But man, I gotta check my fucking emails.

1846
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:08,260
Alright.

1847
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:10,689
So we had a category to do there.

1848
01:55:10,689 --> 01:55:15,810
I can hear fireworks outside.

1849
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:17,810
I have so many fucked up sources here.

1850
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:20,500
The winner of worst

1851
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,500
joke taking more

1852
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,079
than five minutes to set up.

1853
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:33,949
With 39% of the vote

1854
01:55:33,949 --> 01:55:43,489
sleeping dogs

1855
01:55:43,489 --> 01:55:45,489
pushing a guy into the ocean.

1856
01:55:45,489 --> 01:55:49,260
39%

1857
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:51,260
of all of you said that was the worst thing I did all year.

1858
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:55,340
39%.

1859
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:58,930
I actually thought that was fun.

1860
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:03,149
What am I hearing?

1861
01:56:03,149 --> 01:56:06,739
What's this noise I'm hearing?

1862
01:56:06,739 --> 01:56:08,739
Is old langs I'm playing at like

1863
01:56:08,739 --> 01:56:10,739
minus 100% volume?

1864
01:56:10,739 --> 01:56:12,739
Yeah it is.

1865
01:56:12,739 --> 01:56:15,680
But let's get this one

1866
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,680
off because we got one more to do.

1867
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,680
Give me those bananas. That's fine.

1868
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,680
Worst joke taking more than five minutes

1869
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:23,680
to set up. We made it to the final

1870
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,680
category. Happy New Year everybody.

1871
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,680
Last category

1872
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:30,939
of the evening.

1873
01:56:30,939 --> 01:56:32,939
Worst stream of the whole year.

1874
01:56:32,939 --> 01:56:38,640
We don't, we only get to do this once.

1875
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:42,609
There were some good categories

1876
01:56:42,609 --> 01:56:44,609
on here. I'm not gonna peek.

1877
01:56:44,609 --> 01:56:49,020
This one. Oh this one.

1878
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:51,020
Don't make me, I'll scream into that mic again.

1879
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:53,020
Louder this time. And I'll put the, I'll turn

1880
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:55,020
the volume all the way up and scream into it. No I won't.

1881
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:57,020
Why would I do that? Why would I like make everybody leave?

1882
01:56:57,020 --> 01:57:00,930
There's a shit load of people here tonight too.

1883
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:02,930
Thanks for coming. There is

1884
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:04,930
over 7,000 people sitting here right now.

1885
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:06,930
Thank you. Hope you

1886
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:08,930
have a good time. This was just a

1887
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:10,930
fun thing that I wanted to do.

1888
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:14,260
Really really short notice.

1889
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:16,260
And why don't we like get

1890
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:18,260
real for a second. I know it's hard

1891
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:20,430
to get real with like handsome

1892
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:23,380
doctor behind me. But

1893
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:25,939
let's be real for a second here.

1894
01:57:25,939 --> 01:57:29,779
Like come on. I love you.

1895
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:32,590
Sorry. Alright that's fine.

1896
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:35,020
But

1897
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,020
I'm like talking to these two people

1898
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,020
here and that's whatever. Keep the guy

1899
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:46,960
with the needle. That was slowing

1900
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:52,079
down. My frame rate was dropping.

1901
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:58,739
So

1902
01:57:58,739 --> 01:58:00,739
we're on top of another

1903
01:58:00,739 --> 01:58:02,979
okay. Double

1904
01:58:02,979 --> 01:58:04,979
tent. This is the wicked

1905
01:58:04,979 --> 01:58:07,600
witch of the west.

1906
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,600
Fucking Dorothy dropped a house on

1907
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:16,560
them. Anyways.

1908
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:20,590
2018 seriously

1909
01:58:20,590 --> 01:58:22,590
was the most my channel has grown

1910
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:24,590
ever. And I'm talking both YouTube

1911
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:26,590
and Twitch. And we

1912
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:28,590
joke around like this and do fucked up stuff

1913
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:30,590
like this. But just please know

1914
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:32,590
I can't even fucking believe

1915
01:58:32,590 --> 01:58:34,590
there. Like for instance there are seven thousand

1916
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:36,590
fucking people here right now. Last year there were maybe

1917
01:58:36,590 --> 01:58:38,590
maybe fifteen hundred

1918
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:40,590
would be at a stream like this. Maybe

1919
01:58:40,590 --> 01:58:42,829
maybe under two thousand. The

1920
01:58:42,829 --> 01:58:44,829
channel has seen ridiculous growth. Tons

1921
01:58:44,829 --> 01:58:46,829
of subscriptions. Tons of money

1922
01:58:46,829 --> 01:58:48,829
and shit. And I just want you to know

1923
01:58:48,829 --> 01:58:50,829
2019 is gonna be fucking even better.

1924
01:58:50,829 --> 01:58:53,649
So I can promise you that.

1925
01:58:53,649 --> 01:58:56,720
Thank you everybody. That has

1926
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,720
been a part of this community for as long as you have. Thank you

1927
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,720
everybody for all the shit that you put up

1928
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,720
with me a lot of the times. Thank you.

1929
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
And

1930
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:10,930
let's go ahead and do it. Much

1931
01:59:10,930 --> 01:59:13,939
love to everybody here. The nominees

1932
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:16,619
for worst stream

1933
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:19,699
of the year go to.

1934
01:59:19,699 --> 01:59:26,779
I've been

1935
01:59:26,779 --> 01:59:28,779
really lately I've been really into

1936
01:59:28,779 --> 01:59:30,779
dexterity type finger

1937
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:33,859
cardboard games.

1938
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:35,859
It's kind of a newer genre.

1939
01:59:35,859 --> 01:59:37,859
I'm the only Labo streamer.

1940
01:59:37,859 --> 01:59:40,289
And I will stand on top of this throne

1941
01:59:40,289 --> 01:59:43,229
and drink the mightiest of all

1942
01:59:43,229 --> 01:59:45,229
fucking wines. That was a scary

1943
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:47,600
one indeed. Wasn't it boys and girls?

1944
01:59:47,600 --> 02:00:04,430
I promise nothing looks

1945
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:06,430
longer. They're leaving. They're leaving. You don't have any

1946
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:08,430
content for them. They don't have any

1947
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:10,430
content they're watching. They're watching a blank stream right now.

1948
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:12,430
You need to put on content

1949
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:14,430
before they all fucking leave.

1950
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:16,430
You've just created a perfect home for

1951
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:18,430
chickadees,

1952
02:00:18,430 --> 02:00:20,989
nut hatches, and

1953
02:00:20,989 --> 02:00:23,300
finches.

1954
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,300
Any of those in Las Vegas.

1955
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:27,300
The only birds that we have here

1956
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,300
in Vegas are scorpions. How much would you have?

1957
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:31,300
Okay let's start it. Start the bidding.

1958
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:33,300
Start the bidding.

1959
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:35,300
Start the bidding at 30 cents.

1960
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:37,300
So it's CVS and I fucking saw this

1961
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:39,300
and I was like that's what I'm streaming tonight.

1962
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:41,300
So that's what you get. The Gamer V portable.

1963
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:43,300
Let me be. Hold on.

1964
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:45,300
This thing was less than 20 bucks.

1965
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,300
It takes three AAA. No.

1966
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:49,300
Look it's not a seat. Look CVS

1967
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:51,300
sellout. That's not even true. You can get everything.

1968
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:53,300
You can get toilet paper at CVS. What are you going to sell out your ass?

1969
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:55,300
Have you seen anybody

1970
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:57,300
play Mario Tennis on live stream before?

1971
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,300
I don't know. Maybe not.

1972
02:00:59,300 --> 02:01:01,300
I might be the

1973
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,300
first guy.

1974
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,300
I should have just fucking bought

1975
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,300
Breath of the Fucking Wild.

1976
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:09,300
Good job Nicholas.

1977
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:11,300
Good luck in the first grade next week.

1978
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:23,579
Those are some bad

1979
02:01:23,579 --> 02:01:25,579
streams.

1980
02:01:25,579 --> 02:01:31,149
How you doing under there? You alright? You guys okay?

1981
02:01:31,149 --> 02:01:33,520
So the worst stream

1982
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,520
of 2018, worst stream of the year

1983
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:43,899
in what some

1984
02:01:43,899 --> 02:01:45,899
would call an upset

1985
02:01:45,899 --> 02:01:51,539
with 23% of the vote

1986
02:01:51,539 --> 02:01:56,909
the Morphe's Law

1987
02:01:56,909 --> 02:01:58,909
and Mario Tennis

1988
02:01:58,909 --> 02:02:00,909
stream. The worst

1989
02:02:00,909 --> 02:02:02,909
stream of the year.

1990
02:02:02,909 --> 02:02:04,909
Worst of the whole fucking year.

1991
02:02:04,909 --> 02:02:11,119
Yeah. There it is.

1992
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:13,119
Worst stream of the year.

1993
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:15,939
Thank you.

1994
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:17,939
Thank you everybody. Let me just say.

1995
02:02:17,939 --> 02:02:20,880
Yes.

1996
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,880
Thank you so much everybody.

1997
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:26,189
We probably should turn to this though.

1998
02:02:26,189 --> 02:02:28,189
So during that stream

1999
02:02:28,189 --> 02:02:30,189
I had a lot of problems

2000
02:02:30,189 --> 02:02:32,189
when we played Morphe's Law on the Switch

2001
02:02:32,189 --> 02:02:34,189
which was. I'll get

2002
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:36,689
to it. Stop it.

2003
02:02:36,689 --> 02:02:39,630
We played Morphe's Law on the Switch.

2004
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:41,630
Probably the worst game I've ever played.

2005
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:43,630
At least in the last year or two.

2006
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:45,630
I was really frustrated

2007
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:47,630
the fact the game was laggy.

2008
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:49,630
There was no. I couldn't even

2009
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:51,630
play the game really. It was not what I thought it was.

2010
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:53,630
It was fun.

2011
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:55,630
I was already frustrated going into Mario Tennis.

2012
02:02:55,630 --> 02:02:57,630
So going into Mario Tennis

2013
02:02:57,630 --> 02:02:59,630
I was really bad at Mario Tennis

2014
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:01,630
and I told myself never to play Mario Tennis

2015
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,630
ever again. And it turned into

2016
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:05,630
the worst stream I've ever done.

2017
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:07,630
I got really frustrated. I made fun of people.

2018
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:09,630
I was really rude. Some of the things I was saying.

2019
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:11,630
I take a lot of it back.

2020
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:15,630
But I will definitely accept the award

2021
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:17,630
here for having the worst stream

2022
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:19,630
of 2018. Moved on to play Binding of Isaac

2023
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:21,630
and that didn't help because that's a hard game.

2024
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:23,630
Why would you move on to Binding of Isaac?

2025
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:25,630
The whole thing was about 4 hours of absolute dogshit.

2026
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:27,630
So

2027
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:29,630
thank you everybody. Thank you so much.

2028
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:31,630
I really appreciate it.

2029
02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:40,270
Why is there like dust coming off of this?

2030
02:03:40,270 --> 02:03:47,949
I feel like I

2031
02:03:47,949 --> 02:03:49,949
don't want to breathe this in so I'm not going to break that.

2032
02:03:49,949 --> 02:03:52,319
Thank you for that worst

2033
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:54,560
stream of the year.

2034
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,560
Runner up by the way if you were curious for

2035
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,560
worst stream of the year.

2036
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,800
Get that out. Get that

2037
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,800
away from me. I don't want that near me now.

2038
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,810
It's in my head.

2039
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:09,260
Runner up for worst stream of the year

2040
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:11,949
was

2041
02:04:11,949 --> 02:04:13,949
Bugleberry's scary stories.

2042
02:04:13,949 --> 02:04:16,899
And I came prepared

2043
02:04:16,899 --> 02:04:20,539
by the way.

2044
02:04:20,539 --> 02:04:22,539
I thought

2045
02:04:22,539 --> 02:04:26,960
I was under the assumption that

2046
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:28,960
the Nintendo Labo streams were going to win.

2047
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,960
So what I was

2048
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,960
going to do is if it won

2049
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,960
I was going to build

2050
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,960
the last one

2051
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,960
in spite of everybody.

2052
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,960
But I don't have to do that now.

2053
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,739
So I was prepared for it.

2054
02:04:44,739 --> 02:04:46,739
It didn't come close.

2055
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:49,470
I thought everybody had those streams.

2056
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:53,760
Apparently not.

2057
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:55,760
And Bugleberry, if Bugleberry

2058
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,760
had won

2059
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,760
you bet your ass you would have gotten

2060
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,760
an appearance from Bugleberry doing a very

2061
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,760
very lengthy set of

2062
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,760
probably 40 minutes worth of stories.

2063
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,899
No not that long.

2064
02:05:09,899 --> 02:05:11,899
But that

2065
02:05:11,899 --> 02:05:13,899
actually probably was the worst stream of the year.

2066
02:05:13,899 --> 02:05:15,899
Like actually

2067
02:05:15,899 --> 02:05:17,899
I like Bugleberry.

2068
02:05:17,899 --> 02:05:19,899
I know a shitload of people hate that fucking character.

2069
02:05:19,899 --> 02:05:21,899
I like that character.

2070
02:05:21,899 --> 02:05:24,210
I think it brings a lot to the table.

2071
02:05:24,210 --> 02:05:27,859
Play Mario Tennis now.

2072
02:05:27,859 --> 02:05:30,670
I kind of

2073
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:32,670
can't do that.

2074
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:36,500
But

2075
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:38,500
there's all your nominees.

2076
02:05:38,500 --> 02:05:44,300
The big finale.

2077
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:46,300
Bugleberry builds a Labo

2078
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:50,140
with a tennis racket in his hand.

2079
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:52,140
Bugleberry Tennis.

2080
02:05:52,140 --> 02:05:56,350
Ay yi yi.

2081
02:05:56,350 --> 02:06:01,409
But happy new year everybody.

2082
02:06:01,409 --> 02:06:03,409
Bugleberry plays Mario Tennis.

2083
02:06:03,409 --> 02:06:05,710
Should I just like take that

2084
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:07,710
worst streams of the year categories and just do a stream

2085
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:09,710
where Bugleberry plays Mario Tennis,

2086
02:06:09,710 --> 02:06:11,710
builds a Labo, and like eats a

2087
02:06:11,710 --> 02:06:13,710
birdhouse or something made out of fucking gingerbread.

2088
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:16,210
I mean it might be worth doing.

2089
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:19,659
I just saw somebody say no

2090
02:06:19,659 --> 02:06:21,659
please. So that means

2091
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:25,119
it might be worth doing.

2092
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:27,119
But that's kind of

2093
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:29,119
the plan here. I knew this stream was only

2094
02:06:29,119 --> 02:06:31,119
going to be a couple of hours.

2095
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:33,119
I didn't even think about this

2096
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:35,119
until very recently.

2097
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:37,119
I'm in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve

2098
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:39,810
and

2099
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:41,810
I'm kind of going to be

2100
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:43,810
fucking screwed.

2101
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:46,819
If I stay here in the

2102
02:06:46,819 --> 02:06:48,819
middle of Las Vegas

2103
02:06:48,819 --> 02:06:51,250
it is like

2104
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:53,250
there's probably like half a million people

2105
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,789
over there.

2106
02:06:55,789 --> 02:06:57,789
I have to like get out of here.

2107
02:06:57,789 --> 02:07:01,310
Don't show boogers on your fucking face.

2108
02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,310
It's 2019 fucking worst of already.

2109
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:05,310
Shit!

2110
02:07:05,310 --> 02:07:25,260
Everything's fine.

2111
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:27,260
Let me take my suit.

2112
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,569
My bananas.

2113
02:07:29,569 --> 02:07:31,739
But I will say

2114
02:07:31,739 --> 02:07:33,739
end of the stream voice it has to be.

2115
02:07:33,739 --> 02:07:36,939
I kind of need to go get some rest.

2116
02:07:36,939 --> 02:07:38,939
And by the way

2117
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:41,180
I do have

2118
02:07:41,180 --> 02:07:43,180
a friend and a girlfriend

2119
02:07:43,180 --> 02:07:45,180
back home that I would

2120
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:47,180
really probably want to spend

2121
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:49,180
the ball drop with.

2122
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,180
So there's nobody's here.

2123
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:54,640
It's just me.

2124
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:57,699
So with that

2125
02:07:57,699 --> 02:07:59,699
really? That's what you want to do on Christmas Eve?

2126
02:07:59,699 --> 02:08:02,510
Build a labo.

2127
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:09,359
Build the labo.

2128
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:11,920
No I have to go.

2129
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,920
I can't stick around. I'll get stuck here.

2130
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:20,699
You guys are absolutely worth it.

2131
02:08:20,699 --> 02:08:23,970
How about this?

2132
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:25,970
Here's a New Year's Eve

2133
02:08:25,970 --> 02:08:29,810
prize for you. Hold on.

2134
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:31,810
But if you're taking off, if that's what you're here for

2135
02:08:31,810 --> 02:08:33,810
see you soon. I'm not going to be live tomorrow

2136
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:35,810
but I'll be live the day after so I'll be live on January

2137
02:08:35,810 --> 02:08:38,500
2nd. We'll go back

2138
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:40,500
to normal. This was literally just a last

2139
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:42,500
second thing to do. A shit

2140
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:44,500
load of people came together to make this possible. So thank you

2141
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,500
everybody that even put an ounce of effort into this

2142
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,500
from the nominations to the categories

2143
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,500
to the people that were involved. It was

2144
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:52,500
a huge community effort to get this done

2145
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:54,500
in two days. So thank you so fucking

2146
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:57,310
much all you guys.

2147
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:59,310
It's going to be a $200

2148
02:08:59,310 --> 02:09:01,939
Uber. I'll fucking swim there.

2149
02:09:01,939 --> 02:09:07,310
So I'll give you

2150
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:09,310
how about this? Before I go

2151
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:11,310
let's have a little bit of fun with the screen

2152
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:21,789
for Encore Night. Let's get

2153
02:09:21,789 --> 02:09:25,500
this up.

2154
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:27,500
I kind of got to move this out of the way. Actually

2155
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:29,500
I kind of can't. I guess

2156
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,500
I can move it forward. I'm going to tip this whole fucking

2157
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:33,810
thing over.

2158
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:40,979
Hold on. Ah the immersion

2159
02:09:40,979 --> 02:09:43,539
is ruined. He was

2160
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:45,539
sitting on the toilet the whole time.

2161
02:09:45,539 --> 02:09:47,970
In his green painted bathroom.

2162
02:09:47,970 --> 02:09:57,500
So there's that.

2163
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,260
Well I mean I'm at a desk so

2164
02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:04,289
and

2165
02:10:04,289 --> 02:10:06,289
three, two, one.

2166
02:10:06,289 --> 02:10:12,239
You here for the interview?

2167
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:15,250
No no just sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

2168
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:17,250
Absolutely. What's your name?

2169
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:20,260
Okay alright.

2170
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:22,260
So what is it about this

2171
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:24,260
company that you think that you can add

2172
02:10:24,260 --> 02:10:26,430
you know some

2173
02:10:26,430 --> 02:10:39,869
worth to? Well we're going to

2174
02:10:39,869 --> 02:10:41,869
need a lot of that so it's really

2175
02:10:41,869 --> 02:10:43,869
important that you understand.

2176
02:10:43,869 --> 02:10:46,430
I need valuable team members.

2177
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:54,220
And what's that?

2178
02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:56,220
Okay well I don't think

2179
02:10:56,220 --> 02:10:58,220
the position is for you. The position

2180
02:10:58,220 --> 02:11:00,220
already has been filled. So

2181
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:02,220
thank you for your resume

2182
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:04,220
by the way which was awful.

2183
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:06,460
It was a terrible resume. So please

2184
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,460
get the fuck out of my office.

2185
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:17,420
Loser.

2186
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:19,420
Oh hey come on. Come have a seat over here.

2187
02:11:19,420 --> 02:11:21,420
Right here. You got the seat?

2188
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,420
Go take a seat. How are you?

2189
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:25,420
So I was looking at your resume.

2190
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,420
And it

2191
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:29,420
looks like you've got some. You went to

2192
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:31,420
school? You went to

2193
02:11:31,420 --> 02:11:33,420
Harvard? Unbelievable.

2194
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:36,180
That's really really great.

2195
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:38,180
It says here you were a chef.

2196
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,180
A chef?

2197
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:44,000
Wow.

2198
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,689
I wish I could be a chef.

2199
02:11:46,689 --> 02:11:48,689
So anyways also on the back here you drew

2200
02:11:48,689 --> 02:11:50,689
a couple of weird

2201
02:11:50,689 --> 02:11:52,689
symbols. It looks like

2202
02:11:52,689 --> 02:11:54,689
it kind of looks like

2203
02:11:54,689 --> 02:11:56,689
penile to me. I'm not sure why you drew

2204
02:11:56,689 --> 02:11:58,689
this on your resume. Must have been like

2205
02:11:58,689 --> 02:12:00,689
a funny mistake. But we all make funny mistakes though.

2206
02:12:00,689 --> 02:12:02,689
So it's okay. I've made funny

2207
02:12:02,689 --> 02:12:04,689
mistakes like that before like trying to mess with my

2208
02:12:04,689 --> 02:12:06,689
friends. You know drawing like little penile shapes.

2209
02:12:06,689 --> 02:12:08,689
And that's fine but I don't

2210
02:12:08,689 --> 02:12:11,310
know why you're doing it on your resume.

2211
02:12:11,310 --> 02:12:14,380
Now you know I'm going to take a chance.

2212
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,380
Yeah with you. You're hired.

2213
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:20,220
Nah I'm just kidding. You're fired.

2214
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:22,220
You're fired. I'm not fucking hiring you.

2215
02:12:22,220 --> 02:12:24,220
I just invite people in here.

2216
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,220
I invite people in here

2217
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:28,220
to pretend that I'm going to give them a job.

2218
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,220
And then when they show up oh fuck up the suit I'm

2219
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:32,220
wearing. I tell them to fuck off.

2220
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:34,220
Like I'm doing to you.

2221
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:43,229
Sneakers.

2222
02:12:43,229 --> 02:12:46,560
Alright so this is like a little bit

2223
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:55,140
of space right here. Casual

2224
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:57,140
Friday. I don't know how to fucking

2225
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:59,140
dress. I don't know how to wear clothes.

2226
02:12:59,140 --> 02:13:01,569
You guys think I know anything about this?

2227
02:13:01,569 --> 02:13:03,739
You know here's how it works.

2228
02:13:03,739 --> 02:13:05,739
It's called let me make sure I'm in the right spot

2229
02:13:05,739 --> 02:13:07,739
to get this explained to everybody.

2230
02:13:07,739 --> 02:13:14,020
Move this out of the way. Oh

2231
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:16,020
no come on in. Come on in. You're here for the job

2232
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,020
right? Yeah no take that

2233
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,189
seat right there.

2234
02:13:20,189 --> 02:13:22,189
Just don't mind the wood. Don't mind the nice

2235
02:13:22,189 --> 02:13:24,430
wood. Yeah it's really

2236
02:13:24,430 --> 02:13:26,430
good wood. So I was

2237
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:28,800
looking at your resume.

2238
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,800
No no yeah absolutely.

2239
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,800
You can say something. Before you say anything

2240
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,800
I just want to make sure that you're aware of how strong

2241
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,800
I am as your company manager.

2242
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,800
This wooden desk you see

2243
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,800
is 445 pounds

2244
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,800
and with ease I can just get it.

2245
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:44,800
I think I just ripped out the ethernet.

2246
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:48,060
Did I? No I didn't.

2247
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,060
Why don't you have a seat? No come on in.

2248
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:52,060
Ethernet's right here. I can't fuck with that.

2249
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:54,060
No come on in sit down. Yeah

2250
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:58,060
somebody will just cut this together.

2251
02:13:58,060 --> 02:14:00,239
So this desk here

2252
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:02,239
is made out of wood and you know before

2253
02:14:02,239 --> 02:14:04,239
I hire anybody I want to make sure that

2254
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:06,239
they understand that I am a very strong

2255
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:08,239
manager and I can lift up

2256
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:10,239
this is a 450 pound wooden desk.

2257
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:12,239
Just so you know who you're

2258
02:14:12,239 --> 02:14:14,239
dealing with.

2259
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:21,899
That's who you're dealing with right now.

2260
02:14:21,899 --> 02:14:24,529
I just peeked the mic.

2261
02:14:24,529 --> 02:14:28,939
How loud was that? Can somebody clip that?

2262
02:14:28,939 --> 02:14:38,539
I'm serious.

2263
02:14:38,539 --> 02:14:41,100
I turned the mic down too.

2264
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:44,369
Fuck. Did I actually just peek the mic?

2265
02:14:44,369 --> 02:14:51,920
Why can't I open this?

2266
02:14:51,920 --> 02:15:00,689
I want to make sure that they understand that I am a very strong

2267
02:15:00,689 --> 02:15:02,689
manager and I can lift up

2268
02:15:02,689 --> 02:15:04,689
this is a 450 pound wooden desk.

2269
02:15:04,689 --> 02:15:06,689
Just so you know who you're

2270
02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:08,689
dealing with.

2271
02:15:08,689 --> 02:15:11,760
That was really fucking loud.

2272
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,760
Lost a hundred viewers.

2273
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:19,520
Lost a hundred viewers.

2274
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,760
Happy New Year. It's alright.

2275
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,760
Alright. I gotta go.

2276
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:26,060
I gotta get out of here.

2277
02:15:26,060 --> 02:15:28,060
I need to clean up and lock up and everything.

2278
02:15:28,060 --> 02:15:31,579
Oh I did.

2279
02:15:31,579 --> 02:15:33,579
You got access to the green screen.

2280
02:15:33,579 --> 02:15:35,579
The manager is strong bit.

2281
02:15:35,579 --> 02:15:47,300
What time is it? Yeah it's getting to that

2282
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:50,880
point where I'm gonna get trapped here.

2283
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,880
Happy New Year everybody. I'll see you in a couple days.

2284
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:54,880
Thank you so much. I'm sorry I can't really go over

2285
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,880
the subs and the bits

2286
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,880
but a shit load of people gave stuff.

2287
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:00,880
Let's see if there's any big big ones that I don't want to miss.

2288
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,680
I have it open

2289
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:24,300
somewhere. I think I have

2290
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:26,300
ah that's a top banana for you.

2291
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:28,300
That's a hundred community subs.

2292
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:31,760
From the Great Canadian Fuck Club.

2293
02:16:31,760 --> 02:16:33,760
That's five hundred fucking dollars.

2294
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,760
A hundred community

2295
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:37,760
subs.

2296
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:44,340
Holy shit.

2297
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:46,340
Happy New Year.

2298
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:48,340
You've been contributing insane amounts of

2299
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:50,340
subs and money for a while now.

2300
02:16:50,340 --> 02:16:53,020
Thank you.

2301
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:55,020
You did it twice.

2302
02:16:55,020 --> 02:16:58,350
Hold on you did that two times tonight?

2303
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:00,350
You did that two fucking times.

2304
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:04,899
Oh my god.

2305
02:17:04,899 --> 02:17:08,350
Holy shit.

2306
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:12,829
Wow. That's fucking crazy.

2307
02:17:12,829 --> 02:17:16,420
That's unbelievable.

2308
02:17:16,420 --> 02:17:18,420
Thank you so much.

2309
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:21,040
That's crazy amount of subs.

2310
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:24,110
A thousand dollars in subs.

2311
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:29,409
That's unreal. Thank you.

2312
02:17:29,409 --> 02:17:32,219
Two fucking hundred subs.

2313
02:17:32,219 --> 02:17:36,129
Jesus.

2314
02:17:36,129 --> 02:17:38,690
Great Canadian Fuck Club.

2315
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:40,690
I don't know what to say.

2316
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:44,770
That's so much.

2317
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:46,770
Mod Kyle and Fuck Club.

2318
02:17:46,770 --> 02:17:50,799
We also had

2319
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:52,799
fifty dollars a few minutes ago here.

2320
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:55,360
This is where you bring out the champagne.

2321
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:57,659
Right?

2322
02:17:57,659 --> 02:17:59,659
Yeah. Champagne kind of got lost in the

2323
02:17:59,659 --> 02:18:01,899
try to get stream on

2324
02:18:01,899 --> 02:18:03,899
on time.

2325
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:05,899
Because I had to be fairly on time tonight.

2326
02:18:05,899 --> 02:18:08,780
I couldn't just turn the stream on.

2327
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:10,780
Give me another hour to set up.

2328
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:12,780
I had to be on time.

2329
02:18:12,780 --> 02:18:14,780
Getting all those videos compiled and

2330
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:16,780
all them ready into the stream and everything.

2331
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:18,780
Champagne popping

2332
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:20,780
was not really on the list

2333
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:22,780
of priorities.

2334
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:25,280
But you know it's alright.

2335
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,709
I'll have a glass of champagne when I get home.

2336
02:18:27,709 --> 02:18:29,709
For you guys.

2337
02:18:29,709 --> 02:18:32,530
Because this year was all about

2338
02:18:32,530 --> 02:18:34,530
you guys. And next year will be even

2339
02:18:34,530 --> 02:18:36,530
more. Even better.

2340
02:18:36,530 --> 02:18:38,530
Paul Masson thank you so much for the fifty fucking dollars.

2341
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:42,700
I think that's all the big big ones.

2342
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:44,700
Make sure I didn't miss any others.

2343
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:47,389
Because this is from two hours ago.

2344
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:49,389
I don't see any there.

2345
02:18:49,389 --> 02:18:51,389
Ones that I really really want to make sure I touch on.

2346
02:18:51,389 --> 02:18:56,829
Inspired by the

2347
02:18:56,829 --> 02:18:59,389
French excellence.

2348
02:18:59,389 --> 02:19:01,389
Are you going to do a traffic stream?

2349
02:19:01,389 --> 02:19:03,389
Now I've got to put something else back here though.

2350
02:19:03,389 --> 02:19:05,629
I don't know. That's the wrong thing.

2351
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:07,629
That doesn't matter.

2352
02:19:07,629 --> 02:19:09,629
I've got no outro's. I've got no

2353
02:19:09,629 --> 02:19:11,629
outro screens or anything.

2354
02:19:11,629 --> 02:19:13,629
So happy new year everybody.

2355
02:19:13,629 --> 02:19:15,629
And all you guys that are on mountain

2356
02:19:15,629 --> 02:19:17,629
or central coming up here.

2357
02:19:17,629 --> 02:19:20,379
Happy new year to everybody in North America.

2358
02:19:20,379 --> 02:19:22,379
Happy new year to everybody that already passed.

2359
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:24,379
All the Europeans

2360
02:19:24,379 --> 02:19:26,379
have all celebrated

2361
02:19:26,379 --> 02:19:29,579
already.

2362
02:19:29,579 --> 02:19:31,579
Everybody in Asia. Everybody

2363
02:19:31,579 --> 02:19:33,579
around the world. Happy new year.

2364
02:19:33,579 --> 02:19:36,459
I'm going to go drink a glass of champagne.

2365
02:19:36,459 --> 02:19:38,459
And I'm going to take a rest.

2366
02:19:38,459 --> 02:19:43,260
Happy new year.

2367
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:45,260
I'll see you guys in two days.

2368
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:47,260
I'm not going to stream tomorrow but I'll stream the next day.

2369
02:19:47,260 --> 02:19:50,379
And that's it.

2370
02:19:50,379 --> 02:19:52,379
Love to you all. I'll see you next year.

2371
02:19:52,379 --> 02:19:54,379
I'll see you next year.

2372
02:19:54,379 --> 02:19:58,219
That's the joke that everybody's making tonight, right?

2373
02:19:58,219 --> 02:20:00,219
Good night. Take care.

2374
02:20:00,219 --> 02:20:04,129
See you in a couple days. Ta ta for now.

2375
02:21:29,969 --> 02:21:39,940
I hate the sound of tape.

2376
02:21:39,940 --> 02:21:41,940
I'm sorry guys. This is like turning on an oven

2377
02:21:41,940 --> 02:21:43,940
for me. I don't like ovens. I hate turning on an oven

2378
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,940
and it like freaks me out. I like this box in your house

2379
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:47,940
that heats up to like fucking 500 degrees. I don't like it.

2380
02:21:47,940 --> 02:21:49,940
It's weird and it's gas. This is also, I don't like this.
