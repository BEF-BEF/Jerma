1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,870
Say it now. What's say it now?

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,500
Say what now?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,369
The Drew Crew, what do they want me to do?

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:14,240
Say it. What do you want me to say?

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,740
Drew Crew, coming in.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,320
Is that what you want?

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,579
Want me to call you the Drew Crew?

8
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:26,160
Say no.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,390
Alright, we're not playing this game right now.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,629
Hello everybody, how you doing?

11
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:35,189
Welcome to another live stream.

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,929
This live stream is going to be on a video game

13
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:41,890
that's been shafted quite a few times.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,929
Over the course of the last, I wouldn't say maybe three or four months.

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:51,380
This keeps getting on to chat choice polls

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,060
and either wins and then isn't played

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,590
or loses and isn't played.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,740
So it's been stuck kind of in a limbo.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,829
We're going to be playing Signal Simulator.

20
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:09,950
Pre-stream chat decided that's what was going to happen.

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,269
They finally got it after

22
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,909
after eliminating everything else and playing other stuff.

23
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,709
It's Signal Simulator was still here.

24
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,989
Signal Simulator has always been here.

25
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,049
We're going to do it tonight.

26
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,849
This game could be very, very interesting

27
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,989
or I might get frustrated in the first 30 minutes.

28
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:40,819
I'm going to try to give it at least an hour before I freak out.

29
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,819
If I love this game, we're going to keep playing it.

30
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,099
If I like this game, we're going to keep playing it.

31
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,219
If I don't like this game,

32
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,780
we are going to do a hard pivot

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,379
to something else.

34
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,379
I'm not going to tell you what it is,

35
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,180
because then all of a sudden I'll look over and I'll see

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,420
the waiting room, the waiting room.

37
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,540
Oh my God, Resident Sleeper.

38
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,739
Where is...

39
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,040
I'm not doing that right now.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,079
It's got 20 community subs.

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,420
Holy shit.

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,539
40 actually from John Cena is killed.

43
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,960
40 community subs.

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,330
John Cena, you're a madman.

45
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,419
Thanks for the 40 fucking subs.

46
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:21,750
And who could forget Hold Up On Zombie for the five subs?

47
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,409
All right, whatever.

48
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,810
I'm not going to play...

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,449
I'm not going to tell you what the next game could be.

50
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,530
We are playing Signal Simulator,

51
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,370
not...

52
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,870
Get that through your mind.

53
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,990
What is that in Morse code?

54
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,830
I don't know.

55
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,669
Slow it down.

56
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,939
Figure it out.

57
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,699
Thank you, Ratchley, for the five subs.

58
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,180
Catboy waiting room.

59
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,569
You're going to be waiting here a little while.

60
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,409
You're not going to...

61
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,729
That's not going to happen in the next week or two.

62
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,629
I promise you.

63
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:56,469
All right, is my cam on?

64
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:57,349
I hope it's not.

65
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,490
Let's find out.

66
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,090
Let's hope it's not.

67
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,090
If it is, I'm just covering the lens just in case.

68
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,050
Okay, it's not on.

69
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,759
Good.

70
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,599
What's up?

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,439
I'm getting a lot of subs right now.

72
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,379
Thank you for the subs, everybody.

73
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,830
Robotic Rogue, thanks for five subs.

74
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,270
And you're going to see this over here.

75
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,229
This says continue.

76
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:18,069
I didn't play.

77
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:23,430
I just want to make sure the game ran.

78
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,669
It has the costume on.

79
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,879
I don't have the costume on.

80
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,439
No cam because cat costume.

81
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,520
No, no cam because I have no cam

82
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,740
for 85% of every livestream I've ever done.

83
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,219
All right, so I don't know how this game works.

84
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,379
I'm going to have to pay attention.

85
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,770
I'm going to try.

86
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,280
You guys can't hear anything, now you can.

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I'm going to...

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,939
I have to pay attention.

89
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,680
This is a pay attention game.

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,990
We have to find aliens with our satellite dishes.

91
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,590
If we can find them, we...

92
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
I don't know.

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,629
I don't know what happens.

94
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:03,080
I haven't played.

95
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,250
Here we go.

96
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,129
Signal simulator.

97
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,819
You guys have been waiting for this.

98
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,020
Thanks, Jim Beas with five subs.

99
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,840
Appreciate it.

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm zooming.

101
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,660
Oh, good.

102
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,360
That's very loud.

103
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,139
Let's fix that.

104
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,660
Better be a solid sound.

105
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,740
Oh, all right.

106
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,459
Yeah, we're going to bring that down.

107
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:35,360
We're going to bring that down just a little.

108
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
Now it's too soft.

109
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,410
What?

110
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,500
This is full blast and this is zero.

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,240
This is still zero.

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,120
This is still zero.

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,660
This is still zero.

114
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,680
But the last third of the bar is what actually matters.

115
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,519
That's all right.

116
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,439
I like that.

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,259
All right.

118
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,040
Press F to sit.

119
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,259
Is this my office or something, I would assume?

120
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,839
System efficiency, 100%.

121
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,019
Is that my microphone?

122
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,750
Is there a tutorial?

123
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,930
Press F11.

124
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,430
Use the antenna control panel

125
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,689
to start rotating the antennas.

126
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,399
Azimuth will rotate the antennas horizontally.

127
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,500
Elevation will rotate the antennas vertically.

128
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,699
I can rotate the antenna up and down.

129
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:36,740
While the antennas are rotating,

130
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,220
the energy consumption will increase.

131
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,370
Antennas can be upgraded to rotate faster.

132
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,750
We're looking for this guy.

133
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,339
So let's do that.

134
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,870
Press F to press.

135
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,149
All right, so this is...

136
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,339
I can't even read that.

137
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,699
Is my FOV too high or something?

138
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:14,160
I can't even read this.

139
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,740
This coffee is really hot.

140
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,060
I don't think that's the same reaction.

141
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,399
I think you would have a different reaction

142
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,860
with coffee that hot.

143
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,699
Drink it all.

144
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,040
No, are you serious?

145
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,959
Wait, do we seriously have to drink coffee

146
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,920
in less than 10 minutes of weirdos in this chat?

147
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,759
No.

148
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,120
If you get a hot coffee,

149
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
you sip it over the course of like three hours

150
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,959
until it is warm and then cold.

151
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,959
And then you get the gross part of the bottom

152
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,160
that you just end up dumping into like the sink

153
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,319
because it's so disgusting you refuse to drink it.

154
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,529
The last like one to 2% of the coffee.

155
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,560
All right, how do I rotate this thing?

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,839
Oh, okay.

157
00:06:58,839 --> 00:06:59,680
I can't...

158
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,779
Is there like a magnifying glass?

159
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:02,949
Okay, there we go.

160
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,500
All right, so Azimuth, Q to decrease,

161
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,819
press E to increase.

162
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,180
Wait, don't rotate yet.

163
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:19,050
Which one am I rotating?

164
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,579
Press E to Q, okay.

165
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:29,430
Start rotation, E, Q.

166
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,269
Turn it on.

167
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:45,389
I'm pressing, okay, E, Q.

168
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:50,110
How do I turn the fucking thing on?

169
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,579
Is it not on?

170
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,069
You're never gonna figure this out.

171
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,860
Info, hold on, let me read this.

172
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,560
Info monitor will provide you with information

173
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,939
of your main systems, okay.

174
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,620
It's the efficiencies, performance of the systems

175
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,439
and percent.

176
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,100
This is like why I have like five employees.

177
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,720
This is like one of them does this.

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,040
I just want, guys, is there somebody that does the monitor,

179
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,779
somebody that does the signaling,

180
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,139
somebody that does like the repairs

181
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,939
and then I walk around with an expensive suit on

182
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,550
with my hands in my suit pocket jacket, both hands,

183
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,769
walking around looking over at everybody's monitors.

184
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,129
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, dude, nice.

185
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,569
And I shake my hands a little bit

186
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,370
and my hands come out and I point.

187
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,289
Nice, dude, nice, nice, nice, cool, cool, cool, good job,

188
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,129
good job.

189
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:43,179
Hands go back in the pockets, walk to the next station.

190
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,279
Use the laptop button just to access the sky scanner.

191
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,919
Sky scanner will detect anomalies in the sky

192
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,200
and once analyzed, you'll be able to start

193
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,340
detecting a signal, okay.

194
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,480
Laptops for the sky scanner.

195
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,950
Gotta figure out how to turn the fucking computer on first.

196
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,700
Performance of the systems in percentages, okay.

197
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,220
Charge efficiency, reach, stop resident sleepering me.

198
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm trying to, I'm trying to learn the game.

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Recharge performance of the solar panels,

200
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,519
cleaning them, I'm just reading and not comprehending.

201
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,259
Stop, here we go.

202
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,539
Recharge performance of the solar panels,

203
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:19,080
cleaning them will increase the charge efficiency, okay.

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,850
How fast the antenna is rotating.

205
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,049
Detection error for the signal.

206
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:25,769
If the signal elevation is 50 and the coordination is,

207
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:28,480
oh man, I need to hire somebody for this.

208
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,340
I need to hire somebody for this.

209
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,340
Range of the antenna or how close you are to position.

210
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,269
I need to hire somebody for this one.

211
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll figure it out.

212
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,580
Okay, so status is ready.

213
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,620
Azimuth is ready.

214
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,659
Azimuth is the name of the satellite.

215
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,100
How do I turn the fucking machine on?

216
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:57,029
Start rotation, do I do it?

217
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,659
On, wait, what?

218
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:02,059
Wait, wait, wait, why is it like an old dryer

219
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,340
to turn the fucking computer on

220
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,899
that's like 100 billion dollars?

221
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,419
Really?

222
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:16,409
Okay, 80, 80 and 82, what should we do?

223
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:23,220
70, 60, 80, 65, all right, 75, 82.

224
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:41,330
Start, do I do it?

225
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:50,179
Where is the thing?

226
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:54,320
Turn the volume up?

227
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,139
This is getting really loud.

228
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,590
Okay, did I do it?

229
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,779
Oh fuck, something's going on over here.

230
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,539
What's going on over here?

231
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,740
All right, I'm just like the new employee that's like,

232
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,860
oh, do I turn this on?

233
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,980
What's this button do?

234
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,379
Oh, deactivate government firewall?

235
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,240
Shucks, what's all these numbers?

236
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,700
Access granted, whoopsie daisy.

237
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,379
You need to scan for the signal.

238
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,679
All right, well let's open up the laptop.

239
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh boy, okay, shooter, scanner.

240
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,279
Oh shit, all right, here we go.

241
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,610
Look for a signal.

242
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,129
Are these every, is this every planet

243
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,289
and every star in the universe?

244
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,330
Left mouse button, scan here.

245
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:06,899
Scan failed, oh shit.

246
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:15,009
Scan failed, you must check them all.

247
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,210
Scan failed, I have to hold it?

248
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,059
Anomaly detected, anomaly detected.

249
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,669
Detected, help, boss, I detected an anomaly.

250
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:40,470
What do I do?

251
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,139
Just close the computer?

252
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:51,070
What are these coordinates?

253
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,549
Seven, one, one, point, three, zero.

254
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,750
All the arrows, what arrows?

255
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,590
What the fucking arrows?

256
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:13,240
What arrows are, where are the arrows?

257
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Now what?

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,580
I mean, bottom right.

259
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,370
Oh shit, what the fuck is that?

260
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,730
I found, I found a planet.

261
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,970
Polarization of the electromagnetic waves.

262
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:51,970
What, no, oh, all right, I'm gonna fall back.

263
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,590
I'm gonna go to my boss with all this info.

264
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,909
Turns out I was like in the middle

265
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,950
of like fucking Miami somewhere

266
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,740
and like this guy brushes teeth.

267
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,019
Like look what I found, I found aliens.

268
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,059
Look where it's pointed, it's pointed.

269
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,379
It's like dude, that was pointing at Miami, dude.

270
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,059
And that's like a dude brushing his teeth

271
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,679
like you're a fucking idiot.

272
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,759
Tune the anomaly.

273
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,429
Something's talking.

274
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:22,179
Like, can you hear it?

275
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,220
Visual proceeding.

276
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:40,889
I can hear someone speaking.

277
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,720
Whoa, signal detected.

278
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,659
Is my phone ringing?

279
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,740
Yeah, what am I supposed to do?

280
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,639
Where?

281
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,590
Escape, escape, escape.

282
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,429
The phone's ringing.

283
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:01,110
How do I answer the phone?

284
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,750
Shoot it down, whatever it is.

285
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:13,100
Leave the PC, leave the PC.

286
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,940
How do I answer the phone?

287
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:23,690
How do I answer that?

288
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,529
Leave the building.

289
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:27,889
Why would I leave the building right now?

290
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,490
Signal available, tracking available.

291
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:37,799
How do I track it?

292
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:40,320
Next to the laptop.

293
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,919
Download audio data.

294
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,679
The fuck was that?

295
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,799
Hold on, hold on, let's help here.

296
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:46,919
Frequency detection.

297
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,600
Once a signal is detected with the sky scanner,

298
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,399
you have to find the right frequency signal.

299
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
When you've found the coordinate detection system,

300
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,440
we activate the search for somebody.

301
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,899
All right, what do I do here?

302
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,139
How do I do this?

303
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,779
Off the secret, next to the laptop?

304
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,399
I can't pick this up.

305
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,279
How do I pick that up?

306
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,470
Look behind you.

307
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,070
Wrong panel.

308
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,629
Audio signal control.

309
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,129
Download audio control.

310
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,090
Should I scan this here?

311
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:24,940
Manual mode, frequency lock, volume.

312
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,590
Right, middle.

313
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,909
Antenna detection control.

314
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:33,769
Detection, energy.

315
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:36,230
I don't even know what it wants me to do.

316
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,049
What does it want me to even just hit auto scan?

317
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:46,250
Auto scan.

318
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,850
Too many fucking buttons.

319
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,090
Where is it?

320
00:16:49,090 --> 00:17:01,179
Auto scan.

321
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,470
It's not doing anything.

322
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,690
Just turn on the coordinate machine.

323
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:10,809
Left, Jerma.

324
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,049
All right, look, there's like a five second delay on stream.

325
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:15,849
If you say, look to the left, and I go left,

326
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,769
and you go, no, that's too far left, go to the right.

327
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,410
I'm already over here.

328
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,970
By the time I get to here, you say left,

329
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,809
and by the time I get to here,

330
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:28,789
you tell me to go back right.

331
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:29,630
Phone.

332
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:35,069
I can't even go this far.

333
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:35,910
Auto scan.

334
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,509
Once signals detected, you have to find

335
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:38,789
the right frequency for the signal.

336
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:45,650
Didn't I already do that?

337
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,450
I just do it on manual mode?

338
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,980
Look up.

339
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,460
It's negative 16 degrees Celsius in this room.

340
00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:02,789
I don't know, I can die here.

341
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:07,019
I do manual mode?

342
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:14,670
Thank God.

343
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:22,769
Well, that's not your movie.

344
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,690
What am I doing?

345
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,460
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

346
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,299
The game's tutorial is like a syllabus you get

347
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,250
in the first day of school.

348
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:55,049
I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.

349
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,009
You didn't read the syllabus.

350
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,710
No, I did read the syllabus.

351
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:13,500
Very much so.

352
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,140
Just hit the auto scan.

353
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:24,690
I pressed this button, I think, 30 times.

354
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,710
The shit.

355
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,349
Oh, fuck.

356
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:32,890
My mic is desynced because of last stream.

357
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,880
Oh my God.

358
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,000
It was by like almost two full seconds.

359
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,339
Thank God you caught that.

360
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,480
Wait, so that's another problem.

361
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,319
Hold on a second.

362
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,319
So you were telling me to go left,

363
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,660
and I was saying I'm going left,

364
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,559
but a full two seconds was going by before you heard it.

365
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,779
So therefore, I was going right

366
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:54,119
by the time you were telling me to go right,

367
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,799
and I was saying left.

368
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,440
All right, so where the fuck do I actually go?

369
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,369
Wait, what the fuck?

370
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:02,450
Okay, hold on.

371
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,450
Hold on, right here.

372
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:11,339
And just, this is it, right?

373
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:14,339
So track the coordinates.

374
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:20,180
No, that's so funny.

375
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,599
Turn the manual knob until you click green.

376
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:31,619
Wait, I got something.

377
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:33,519
I got something.

378
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,359
We got one.

379
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

380
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,990
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

381
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,349
All right, track it.

382
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:58,829
Oh shit, what's going on?

383
00:20:58,829 --> 00:20:59,670
That's some Ghostbusters.

384
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,829
If you don't know what that is, then oh my God.

385
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,490
Get out of here.

386
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,960
All right, so I have 55, 51.

387
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,799
Okay, hold on.

388
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,960
That's too many things.

389
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
28, 76.2.

390
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,099
Look at the averages.

391
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:26,099
31.5 and 67.9.

392
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,619
46.9, all right.

393
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,059
44....

394
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,940
Ha ha ha ha ha!

395
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,779
I did not...

396
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,160
43.1 and 75.2.

397
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,140
This keeps changing.

398
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,980
Eleva...

399
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,940
All right, so let's go elevation.

400
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,140
We need 77.

401
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,779
Let's just, I'm doing 47 and 77.

402
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,069
I don't even care.

403
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:57,789
So we need 47 and 77.

404
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,500
And then 77.

405
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,450
Okay, here we go.

406
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,170
It's time to go.

407
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,369
I've found the coordinate.

408
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:28,269
I've found the alien.

409
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:29,309
FTP is running.

410
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,440
I have unlimited services.

411
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,279
FTP connections.

412
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,140
How many, why are there like 2,000 people connected to me?

413
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,670
Okay, is it there?

414
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,069
Did I go into this completely blind?

415
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,549
One, yes, 100%.

416
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:43,750
I have no idea what's going on.

417
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,589
Absolutely no clue.

418
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:47,430
I downloaded it and then I turned it on

419
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,250
and turned the stream on.

420
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,710
Okay, so tracking available.

421
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,509
Is that, are we good?

422
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,900
Coordinates.

423
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,579
The system will activate when a signal

424
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,259
is detected in the sky, yeah.

425
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,099
Once the system is activated,

426
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:03,460
it will give you coordinates within the range

427
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,099
based on the coordinate detection system.

428
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,819
You can switch between different visual layers

429
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,630
using the coordinate detection control panel.

430
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,619
Okay, but now what?

431
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:15,700
We're at 47, 77.

432
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,019
48 to seven, maybe a little, okay, 48 point.

433
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,670
No, this is accurate.

434
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,299
Now I have to go to the coordination detection panel.

435
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,339
So it's on, okay.

436
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,299
Oh, shit, there it is.

437
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:39,759
All right, so we gotta go up a little more.

438
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,200
We need to go to,

439
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,069
up and right.

440
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,109
What is up and right though?

441
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:53,900
42, 42 and then 80.

442
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,279
All right, 42, 80.

443
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,440
42, 80.

444
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:10,079
Oh, we good?

445
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:20,319
We're spinning, okay, and then we're gonna go up.

446
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,180
It's not instant.

447
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:32,029
Oh, I watch as it moves in elevation bars to the right.

448
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:39,309
Okay, go for a walk in the meantime.

449
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:45,069
What do you mean go for a walk in the meantime?

450
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,500
I just get up from my desk, you sure?

451
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,539
I feel like I'm almost there.

452
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:55,819
I'm over the bullseye.

453
00:24:55,819 --> 00:25:01,819
Look at the center console.

454
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:05,440
Well, as it moves, it's at 41.

455
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,819
We need as it moves to be at 51.

456
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:21,180
Oh, crap.

457
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,619
Go, go, go, go, go.

458
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:27,990
I'm gonna get you and when I get you, I'm gonna get you.

459
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,390
50 and 75, what are we at?

460
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,339
70, 51, we need elevation to be at 75.

461
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:41,690
51, 75, we almost there?

462
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,609
That's like, we're right there, 51, 75.

463
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,710
All right, come on, what the fuck?

464
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,420
Where is this thing?

465
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,829
53, it's like right here.

466
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:53,869
Is it, can I track?

467
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:57,859
Track coordinates.

468
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,289
Do I do attention detail?

469
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,630
48, 78, it's not a fucking scope.

470
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,210
All right, I can finally watch my favorite streamer.

471
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,630
Start at the minimum and then go to the maximum.

472
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,539
Wait, what?

473
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,539
29 and 64, that's not what I do.

474
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,210
Why would I do that?

475
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,279
No, that's not how this works.

476
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,759
I can't, what is making that sound?

477
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,240
Because I'm gonna turn it down.

478
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,430
Oh, fuck, what happened?

479
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,700
I thought that was volume.

480
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,819
Shit, did I mess that up?

481
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,299
All right, but what am I, all right.

482
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,779
How do I turn this fucking sound off?

483
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:56,140
Oh, thank God, okay.

484
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,900
What am I trying to do?

485
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,779
Am I trying to get this blue circle in the middle?

486
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,400
Can't track coordinates or anything.

487
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,480
No, it's time for a hard pivot Andy.

488
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:20,339
We'll see, maybe.

489
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,960
Do I go back on the laptop?

490
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,660
Put the elevation up a little more.

491
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:34,220
Okay, 79, go for it.

492
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:43,619
Elevation, 60, I can't even read this circle.

493
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,589
Don't get discouraged.

494
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:48,150
No, I'm just, I feel like this is one of those games

495
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,869
where you have to sit here for like an hour or two

496
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:56,349
before you understand how the game even works.

497
00:27:56,349 --> 00:28:04,759
Oh, up, not down, wait, I didn't go up?

498
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,799
What is detection control?

499
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,059
Do I have any more tutorials?

500
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,500
I can switch between different visual layers

501
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,960
using the, yeah, I thought I did that, hold on.

502
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,480
One or two hour resident sleeper.

503
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,579
I can't track these coordinates because it's not in there.

504
00:28:28,579 --> 00:28:32,559
Board is right there.

505
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,059
I mean, look, you can't sit me down

506
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,420
in front of your school project

507
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,369
that I've never been to one class of yours.

508
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:42,130
Like you're in a fucking geology class

509
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,049
and you sit me down in all this shit that I don't know

510
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,250
and you go, hey, can you do my homework for me?

511
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,690
It's right there, it's right there.

512
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,579
You don't know that?

513
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:51,500
No, I don't know, you have like 10 monitors, dude,

514
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,259
and I have not sat in one of your college classes.

515
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:59,049
I have no fucking idea what's happening.

516
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:00,849
In fact, you're gonna get an F.

517
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:10,509
Do your work, don't tell me to do this, do your own work.

518
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:11,869
All right, I'm missing something here.

519
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:18,839
I feel like I need to do this.

520
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,079
Wallace and Gromit waiting room.

521
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,359
You can scroll down on that tutorial page, I can.

522
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,049
There's nothing here.

523
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:30,210
So what, okay, what is the goal

524
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,690
of me trying to hit this average here?

525
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:42,740
It's 48.75.

526
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,180
Wait, what do you mean actually pretending?

527
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,779
Scroll on the right, fucking God.

528
00:29:50,619 --> 00:29:51,859
I have a criticism here.

529
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,269
This is a criticism for the game.

530
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,789
What's all this space for?

531
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:58,069
What's the point of this space?

532
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,619
What is the point of this space?

533
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:01,900
Why do I need to scroll down

534
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,180
past like a paragraph of empty space?

535
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,099
What's the point of that?

536
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:16,799
It can just be right here?

537
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,599
Oh, he's a real critic.

538
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,559
Okay, azimuth min plus coordinate detection

539
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,900
equals possible signal.

540
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,940
From that point, start lowering the current position

541
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,660
or wait until a new lower azimuth is detected.

542
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:37,569
Okay, so we go to the minimum, like that person said,

543
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,099
and we start lowering.

544
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,970
I heard like a fucking animal.

545
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay, what's the minimum?

546
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:57,089
27.3.

547
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,960
Okay, 27.3.

548
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,259
All right, here we go.

549
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:08,859
What do we got, anything?

550
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,779
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, it's not,

551
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,859
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

552
00:31:12,859 --> 00:31:13,700
Check the bathroom.

553
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,059
Why would I go to the bathroom?

554
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:17,660
Not, not, not, not, that's wrong.

555
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:30,759
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

556
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:43,890
Oh, 29 minimum 62.

557
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:50,630
I'm just gonna go up from here.

558
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:58,680
Remember, the bars on the left try to fill them.

559
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,829
Azimuth elevation signal strength.

560
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:07,140
Well, what the fuck is this thing?

561
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:18,099
Okay, that, I got up.

562
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:18,940
What do you mean I had it?

563
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:28,900
Check the azimuth didalis.

564
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,740
It was green.

565
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:35,700
What was it, how many minutes green?

566
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,740
Launch the nuke.

567
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,299
Uh, okay, so I'm gonna go 27.86.

568
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:46,819
Did I go by 27.86?

569
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:50,799
Somebody said it was green before.

570
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:58,119
Was it?

571
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,000
When both these are fully green, you have the signal.

572
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,160
Why wouldn't they even be a little green?

573
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:09,380
The thing is right here.

574
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,900
We'll go back to 50.

575
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:20,410
All right, let's go 32.

576
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,410
I'm just trying to get the azimuth.

577
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:29,259
I don't care about the elevation right now.

578
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:30,700
33.

579
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,420
All right, 33, 33, go back, I gotta go up, up, up, up, up, up.

580
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,259
I'm gonna go 35.

581
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,500
Where's the alien?

582
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,259
No, this is like learn how to fly a plane

583
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,289
in the first day of class.

584
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:48,690
No green at all, how?

585
00:33:49,950 --> 00:34:00,730
27, all right, um, I'm gonna go back up to like 48.

586
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,380
Still red, why is it red?

587
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,220
Check the bathroom.

588
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,339
I'll go to the bathroom in a minute.

589
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:07,680
I need to get to like the first alien.

590
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,320
Let me get to the first alien first

591
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,190
and then I'll go to the bathroom.

592
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,900
What happened?

593
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
What the fuck happened?

594
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,739
What happened?

595
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,559
Why is it broken?

596
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,960
What happened?

597
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:37,260
I mean, I lost the signal.

598
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,260
It took too much time.

599
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,780
You think they would wanna ease you into this shit?

600
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,940
No, just sit down at the battle station.

601
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:56,150
I'm going to the fucking bathroom.

602
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,829
No, I know this is one of those games

603
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,389
where this game over there doesn't mean anything.

604
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,420
This is a fake game.

605
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,619
This is a horror game.

606
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:04,739
I'm gonna like have to sleep

607
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,739
in this guy.

608
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,659
I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna hear noises

609
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:07,860
in the kitchen and shit.

610
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,059
I know what this is.

611
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:10,420
This is a fake game.

612
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,889
This is a fake game.

613
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:14,289
And then I'm gonna have to,

614
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:18,010
there's a scary alien monster that I have to avoid.

615
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,639
Okay, yeah, right, okay, fake game.

616
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,780
Game's not even real.

617
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,139
This is like a runaway from the monster

618
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:39,119
and it's just for show.

619
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,380
Get a coffee.

620
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,539
That's an audio, what the fuck is going on here?

621
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:54,409
Let me mow in the lawn.

622
00:35:54,409 --> 00:36:07,739
Did I leave the computer on all night?

623
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:08,699
That's the alien.

624
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,989
Oh shit, avoid the alien.

625
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:19,579
Open the server rack.

626
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:29,400
Next one with the main server established.

627
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:37,659
I don't know about this one.

628
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:40,440
All right, where's the bathroom?

629
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,559
This is the fire exit.

630
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:55,849
Wait, why can I go outside?

631
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,510
Where is the bathroom?

632
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,349
What is this doing?

633
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:04,820
Is this dropping like a package?

634
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,539
No, this is fantastic, dude.

635
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,420
Everybody playing on this server's gonna fucking

636
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,579
just be swarming this area right now.

637
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,010
Once this drops.

638
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,900
Great.

639
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,980
Had a good spot here too.

640
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:28,349
What's this doing?

641
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:38,650
Wait, what?

642
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:43,010
That was an Amazon delivery.

643
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,210
Is that a helicopter right there?

644
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:50,780
Could I fly that?

645
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,380
Okay.

646
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,659
I still don't even understand

647
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:55,420
what the hell I'm supposed to do.

648
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,260
Where's the bathroom?

649
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,980
Is everyone saying check the bathroom?

650
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,860
All right, I checked the bathroom.

651
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,340
There's nothing in the bathroom.

652
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,179
There you go.

653
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:19,369
Bathroom has been checked.

654
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:30,699
Okay, cool.

655
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,019
What do you mean plus one letter grade for a bathroom?

656
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,920
What are you talking about?

657
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,920
All right, well I checked it.

658
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,559
I need to find at least one alien.

659
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,460
I still don't get it.

660
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,059
I don't fucking get it.

661
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,019
I'm trying to get it.

662
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,900
I don't get it.

663
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,300
We gotta start from the beginning again.

664
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,179
All right, so what, how, how, what's the,

665
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:54,780
what do you, do you start?

666
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,699
Um, I don't get it.

667
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,519
I don't get it.

668
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:14,429
You gotta go on the laptop.

669
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:22,710
Okay, there it is.

670
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,829
All right, got first part done.

671
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,619
Found.

672
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:32,610
Oh, that's, that's fucking Jerva Jupiter.

673
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,929
Okay, tune the frequency.

674
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:35,329
Let's get a frequency here.

675
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:39,429
I understand this part.

676
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,460
What the fuck?

677
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,429
That's not it?

678
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:01,730
I got it.

679
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,489
Okay, that part's done.

680
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:04,809
Okay, detected the signal.

681
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,750
Now, disconnect.

682
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,590
Here we go.

683
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,769
I got a whole day to figure this out.

684
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:15,010
We got, I, I, I, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

685
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,369
I don't know, I forget.

686
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,320
What's the next part?

687
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,679
What's the, I don't know what the next,

688
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,519
what's the next part?

689
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,570
I forget.

690
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,610
Frequency.

691
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,849
Oh, I, I, I, yum, yum, yum, yum.

692
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,510
Tracking available?

693
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,679
How?

694
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,880
Tracking available.

695
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,000
Track that, track it, track it.

696
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,239
Track that, track that coordination.

697
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,480
Track it.

698
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,320
Auto scan.

699
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,369
Auto scan, stop.

700
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:46,260
Track the coordinates.

701
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,500
Manual mode.

702
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,780
Turn off auto scan.

703
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,519
14.7, .8, .2.

704
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,440
Okay, here we go.

705
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,389
This is the part that I have trouble with.

706
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:07,909
We need to go, I've got plenty of time.

707
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:08,750
Let's go.

708
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,570
30, what is it?

709
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:15,300
32 and 53, 72.

710
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,340
53, 72, let's go.

711
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

712
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,550
What's going on?

713
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,630
Track the coordinates, I can do that?

714
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:40,170
Oh, fuck, what happened?

715
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,010
Did I have it?

716
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:49,000
Why are these not green?

717
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,039
I thought you guys said I could only track the coordinates

718
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,019
and these are fully green.

719
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:53,860
Is that a lie?

720
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:12,659
I've got, I'm just pretending to drink coffee now.

721
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:19,019
This is not moved at all.

722
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,860
He's never gonna make it to 6 a.m.

723
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,590
All right, this is the part that I don't understand.

724
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,739
So, I'm at 55, 74.

725
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:31,380
Shouldn't there be at least some strength at all

726
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,650
on either one of these two things?

727
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,489
You need help.

728
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,010
Call Joel, you need help.

729
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,409
What do you mean, call Joel?

730
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:44,809
Like, I don't have just Joel on speed dial.

731
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,449
It'll be like, Joel, hey, hey, answer the phone

732
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:50,789
every time I, hey, listen to me.

733
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:52,389
Wait, he might be like eating dinner.

734
00:42:52,389 --> 00:42:53,230
He might be busy.

735
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:59,099
He might be like streaming.

736
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,940
I'm not gonna interrupt somebody's dinner

737
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,219
with my annoying, hey, I don't understand

738
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:10,670
how to like do geology.

739
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,949
Hey, hey, Joel, help me with my geology homework.

740
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:17,989
Can I copy yours?

741
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:19,670
And here's the best part.

742
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,710
I'm pretty sure Joel played this

743
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,469
like five months ago.

744
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,949
So, I need to copy Joel's geometry homework

745
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:29,230
from five months ago.

746
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,340
I think I got an F in the class already.

747
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,699
Okay, so, let me get back to this.

748
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:43,550
Is something to do with this?

749
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,510
I feel like it's something to do with this

750
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,179
and I'm not doing it.

751
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:51,590
It's still rotating.

752
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,510
Well, hurry the fuck up.

753
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:53,750
This thing's like worth a trillion dollars.

754
00:43:53,750 --> 00:44:08,280
It can't turn faster than that.

755
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,260
Okay, we're at 53, 76.

756
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,340
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh my god, oh my god,

757
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,059
oh my god, oh my god, okay.

758
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:19,380
As it's, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, 53.

759
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,860
53, we're gonna go 52.

760
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:39,019
51, go.

761
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:39,940
What?

762
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,659
Wait, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

763
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:42,500
What happened?

764
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,340
54, go.

765
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:54,309
I gotta start updating.

766
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:55,909
Wait, that's what was screwing me up.

767
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:58,110
Okay, wait, wait, wait, 54.

768
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,349
55, here we go.

769
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:00,190
Wrong one.

770
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,980
56, go.

771
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,460
Because it wasn't updating in real time.

772
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,800
That was the problem.

773
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,940
56, we're gonna go 57.

774
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:18,030
58, what happened?

775
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,030
Wait, what the fuck happened?

776
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,869
What happened, what happened, what happened, what happened,

777
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:21,949
what happened, what happened, what happened, what happened?

778
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:23,070
It was just almost all the way up here.

779
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,909
What the fuck happened?

780
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,889
What's going on?

781
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:33,820
56, go back.

782
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:44,750
What happened?

783
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,510
5.2, what is going on?

784
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:55,070
Wasn't this just like right here?

785
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:59,059
55.2, I have to go back to 54?

786
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,460
54.2, all right, wait a minute.

787
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:12,340
54.2, three.

788
00:46:14,659 --> 00:46:16,300
54.3, wrong.

789
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,190
54 point, 54.1.

790
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,070
Holy shit, okay.

791
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,949
54.12, 54.10, 54.0.

792
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,559
Oh shit, 53.95, 53.98.

793
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:57,989
53.97, I can't tell if that's going up or down.

794
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:09,940
53 point, 53.79, I can't tell if that's going,

795
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,670
was that moving?

796
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,630
I almost just puked.

797
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,429
Okay, 50, why am I gonna puke?

798
00:47:16,429 --> 00:47:23,139
53.6, 53.5, come on dude, really?

799
00:47:28,809 --> 00:47:35,710
53.7, this is, I, oh my god damn it, man.

800
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:48,309
53.7, 53.76, 53.8, here we go, 53.81.

801
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:03,050
Here we go, here we go, one more, 53.86.

802
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:08,219
Bingo, 87, bingo, 88, there, oh, 887.

803
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,820
All right, elevation time, 74, okay.

804
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,510
Let's go to 74 elevation.

805
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:34,780
I didn't know it was like this precise.

806
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,619
I'm gonna find that alien.

807
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:39,059
I'm just gonna put two hands around his neck

808
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:40,940
and then shake him back and forth and say,

809
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:50,150
give me the fucking secrets, give me the magic secrets.

810
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:59,050
70, oh, 72, go back, just back and forth.

811
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,090
I know you've solved time travel.

812
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:08,119
I know you have holograms, just give it to us.

813
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:09,840
Little do we know that all these aliens

814
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,039
don't have any of this technology at all.

815
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:15,099
They just figured out how to plant corn in the ground, guys.

816
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,940
Aliens probably have like space ships

817
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,500
and crazy weapons and lasers.

818
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,980
No, no, they just figured out farming,

819
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,659
like basic one-on-one agriculture.

820
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:32,730
We're the ones with the technology, got news for you.

821
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:48,900
70, 74, fuck, nothing at all, nothing at all.

822
00:49:50,019 --> 00:50:06,840
We're going up higher, 76, hurry, hurry.

823
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:20,059
74, come on, I don't wanna lose the signal.

824
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,980
Oh, all right, we're going all the way down.

825
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:28,940
I'm going like 64, my favorite console.

826
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,659
Hey, VYKing, thanks for the 10 community subs.

827
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:35,500
StormyChew5, Jimbius5, RoboticRogue, we already got you.

828
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:43,349
Thanks for the 10, though, we're fine.

829
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,469
All right, I get the game now.

830
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:45,949
Look, it took me like 40 minutes to figure,

831
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:47,429
it's like how it's an interesting game

832
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:48,269
and I have to figure it out.

833
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,389
I can't just know everything,

834
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:53,210
I can't just do your homework in five seconds.

835
00:50:53,210 --> 00:51:07,869
Low, lower, 62, no, go up to 60, I don't know.

836
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:15,320
Shit, all right, we're going up.

837
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:26,280
Minimum, minimum, minimum.

838
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:39,710
I think it's between, yeah, I'm gonna go up.

839
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,630
Come on, have me be high.

840
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,710
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

841
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,349
Well, I, okay, hold on, down.

842
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,469
Average 63, I'm going down to 63.

843
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:50,949
What do you mean down?

844
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:55,090
It's not, I don't know, it's hard to, 63, 62?

845
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,599
Well, I was just going up, it's not, okay, it's not high,

846
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:10,500
it's low, go.

847
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,329
62, you have three seconds to comply.

848
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,119
You have three seconds to, minimum, minimum.

849
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,880
Oh, fuck, I could die, hold on.

850
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,900
You have three seconds to, minimum, minimum, minimum.

851
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,420
That's an old video, no one's fucking saying it,

852
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,409
who cares?

853
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:34,210
All right, 60, come on, pay attention.

854
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,050
What am I gonna pay attention to?

855
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:36,050
There's nothing to pay attention to yet,

856
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:44,500
I have to wait like 15 seconds.

857
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,460
Hey, how's your, how's your new year going so far?

858
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,659
Wait, it's loud, too loud, I don't like it.

859
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:06,360
He's scared, not really, what's there to be afraid of?

860
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,699
I know there's gonna be a jump scare when I beat the game.

861
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:15,539
It has to be, right, why wouldn't there be?

862
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:23,550
Hurry up, 62.1, nothing.

863
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,809
How could I still have absolutely nothing?

864
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:42,820
59, how the fuck are 12K people watching this?

865
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,179
I don't know, that's a good question.

866
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,860
You should ask them one by one.

867
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:54,079
Ask them one by one what they're doing here.

868
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,880
56, no, it's higher, it has to be higher.

869
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,530
It has to be, right?

870
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:13,000
It's forcing us.

871
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,219
Start with, wait, hold on.

872
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,099
You guys are trying to give me help here.

873
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:19,940
Start with azimuth, start at the minimum value.

874
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,460
Wait for it to actually go to that position.

875
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,139
You can check the current position, yeah.

876
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:24,219
It's at the maximum value.

877
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,059
Start rotating through that and watch for the green bar.

878
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:34,099
Start the rotation when, I already, um, excuse me.

879
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:36,420
What, this is full, I did that, I did it.

880
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:41,760
Why give me, I did that already.

881
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,840
All right, so it's, I gotta go up.

882
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,269
Let's go 60, 64.

883
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:54,639
I already did 64, but we'll do it again.

884
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,670
What the hell are you doing?

885
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,389
Why are you guys doing a bread recipe?

886
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:01,099
Really?

887
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:06,219
Get out of here.

888
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,210
Just change the difficulty.

889
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:14,210
I could do that, but I'm already doing this.

890
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,769
Not even a single part of that bar, come on.

891
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:25,539
69, no?

892
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:32,210
70, it has to be in the 70s then.

893
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:38,639
It's not, 70, 71.

894
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,630
What the fuck is happening here?

895
00:55:40,630 --> 00:56:01,300
72, um, 74, 75.

896
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:16,630
Oh, you piece of shit, is that higher?

897
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:34,610
Max is 83, the max is 80, but one decimal at a time.

898
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:44,579
That sounds like a painful experience.

899
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:46,059
Elevation, right, that's what we're doing.

900
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:47,860
We already did azimuth, this is elevation.

901
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:55,730
Max is, well, it just was 80, it just updated.

902
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,019
Come on, it's almost night time.

903
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:06,179
Really, then it has to be like between 80 and 85, nothing.

904
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:10,460
Oh my fucking God, really?

905
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,420
Use the minimum, minimum 64.

906
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,840
I was already down there.

907
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:32,030
I did like 63, 64, 65, 66, 67.

908
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,630
There's a golf cart outside, you can drive.

909
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,840
Yeah, well I need to be able to find the signal first.

910
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,639
All right, I have no idea, I have no idea

911
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:42,239
why I can't find this.

912
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,219
60, I already did like, I did, it's 72.

913
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:58,820
Oh, you don't know that.

914
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:04,619
Do not skip numbers.

915
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:07,780
Signal loss incoming, fuck, I know, but I get it.

916
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,739
This is only my second day on the job.

917
00:58:09,739 --> 00:58:12,340
Imagine about your third day, you understand all this.

918
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,980
I would give that person an immediate raise.

919
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:27,030
They would get an immediate raise.

920
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:43,380
Jesus, I can't even come close, man.

921
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,260
I mean, Jerma sucks.

922
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,699
I'm doing what you're supposed to be doing.

923
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:48,099
I'm just, I'm checking, I'm just checking decimal point.

924
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,300
I'm just checking numbers.

925
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:58,119
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.

926
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,880
You did 71, you didn't do 73 and 74.

927
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:10,380
Dammit, I'm gonna lose the signal now.

928
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,860
Not even one blip on the fucking radar.

929
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,920
Not even a single blip.

930
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,760
I feel like I've done every single number in between

931
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,099
without tiny little decibels.

932
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:24,099
I'm about to lose signal.

933
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,739
Like, you what, you have to find the signal

934
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:42,510
between 65 and 88 to the hundredth decimal point, okay?

935
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,349
All the way up to 86, it's gone.

936
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:47,579
Fucking, the signal's gone.

937
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:54,940
Great, fun.

938
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:03,300
Just turn the knob very gently until you find the signal.

939
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,539
No, I'm not done.

940
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:06,340
No, I'm gonna find one of these signals

941
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,179
and we're gonna go do it.

942
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:08,219
I'm not gonna give up on it,

943
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:13,099
even though I am very, very upset about it.

944
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:14,940
Put it on easy instead.

945
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:21,739
You guys care if I put it on easy?

946
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:40,170
I don't think I can.

947
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,809
Lock the door, is it?

948
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:53,179
Why am I still asleep?

949
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:54,730
Take the bathroom?

950
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:01,969
Mm-hmm.

951
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:04,369
You left the doors open?

952
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:08,460
So what?

953
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,940
Guys, this is like the game Firewatch.

954
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:19,639
I'm the only person here.

955
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:20,480
Okay, I'm ready.

956
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,320
Let's go find the signal.

957
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,139
Go, go, go, go, go.

958
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,130
I'm not wasting a single fucking second, I swear to God.

959
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:51,539
Laptop, let's go.

960
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:54,710
I'm going to try as hard as I can right now to find this.

961
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,869
I know exactly what to do.

962
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:57,630
It's his third day, third time's the charm.

963
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:20,059
Let's find this planet.

964
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:28,889
Come on.

965
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:34,420
Was it higher?

966
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:40,170
Why do I hear the German Raptor?

967
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,369
Watch a YouTube tutorial?

968
01:02:41,369 --> 01:02:43,449
Well, I think I already know now.

969
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:56,150
The time for the YouTube tutorial was 40 minutes ago.

970
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,710
My favorite part about the stream so far

971
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,269
was being on a two second delay

972
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:03,389
and you guys hearing me turn and say where I was going.

973
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:08,679
Accidentally on like a two and a half second delay.

974
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:14,340
All right, got it.

975
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,179
Cool, done?

976
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:16,679
All right, here we go.

977
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:18,860
It's time.

978
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,690
Find that frequency.

979
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:29,289
Scan it.

980
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:48,960
Scan that.

981
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:57,579
Almost there.

982
01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:05,380
Come on, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

983
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,659
Why can't it just auto scan?

984
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:09,739
Do I not have enough power to auto scan?

985
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:15,579
Ow, my fucking ears.

986
01:04:15,579 --> 01:04:17,590
My footsteps?

987
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,150
That was weird.

988
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,989
I got it, got it, got it.

989
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:23,070
All right, good, good, good, good, good, good.

990
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,469
Here we go.

991
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:26,829
Let's move.

992
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,269
What do we got for an average?

993
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:36,519
Now I will find this stupid frequency.

994
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:38,480
We have, what the fuck?

995
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,840
300.

996
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:47,340
333.

997
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,219
What?

998
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,579
That's so, that's too high.

999
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:51,980
325.

1000
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:02,190
That's going to take so long.

1001
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:13,449
That's going to take all night.

1002
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:19,920
300?

1003
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,480
Don't go to the average.

1004
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,639
All right, we're going to go, the average is 320.

1005
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:25,480
What was it?

1006
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,820
312.

1007
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,230
Turn around.

1008
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:32,150
I'm not turning around yet.

1009
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,630
312.

1010
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,550
All right, 306.

1011
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,630
But people say go to the minimum,

1012
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:40,349
but the minimum changes every time.

1013
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:44,619
All right, I'm going to go to 306.

1014
01:05:44,619 --> 01:05:48,960
I can't.

1015
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,780
Well, we just have to wait for that to get to,

1016
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:57,739
it's going to take all night.

1017
01:05:57,739 --> 01:05:59,300
Optimize the power box.

1018
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,800
All right, you got it.

1019
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:15,809
Let's put it on antenna, right?

1020
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,050
It coins at $37,000.

1021
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:24,150
But I was an idiot three or four years ago.

1022
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,989
I was stupid.

1023
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:31,280
I was a dumb guy.

1024
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,199
You are now too.

1025
01:06:32,199 --> 01:06:37,380
Well, sure.

1026
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,440
Bitcoin almost $40,000.

1027
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,360
Hey, remember when it was like 3400 or 3500,

1028
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,409
like two or three years ago?

1029
01:06:47,409 --> 01:06:50,409
I was the idiot.

1030
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:06,730
What's your net worth in Vodkilling?

1031
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,809
Oh man, I'll tell you my net worth in Bitcoin.

1032
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:10,969
Sick.

1033
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:13,809
Hey, when it dropped down to like 3800.

1034
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:16,130
Oh yeah, I told you, here comes the crash.

1035
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,889
Oh no, it was a scam.

1036
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,519
I held onto it for like, I don't know, six months

1037
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:25,960
and I got rid of it at like $4,500 of ECC.

1038
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:28,619
But that doesn't mean I was wrong.

1039
01:07:28,619 --> 01:07:29,980
That does not mean I was wrong.

1040
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,579
That means I was right in the longterm.

1041
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:32,619
I always knew.

1042
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,699
And guess what?

1043
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:35,260
I held onto one, okay?

1044
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,420
I held onto one.

1045
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,820
I still got one.

1046
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,420
I still have one.

1047
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,260
And I'm not gonna sell it

1048
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:52,099
until it's worth a million dollars, all right?

1049
01:07:52,099 --> 01:08:00,730
You're asking what this is going down, what?

1050
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,570
Send power to the coordinates.

1051
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:08,289
Oh shit.

1052
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:23,090
Why would I do that?

1053
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:29,600
320, all right, hold on, I made it better.

1054
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:39,100
This is, I'm not gonna be able to do this.

1055
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:50,539
If what's your BTC, well, give me that coin.

1056
01:08:50,539 --> 01:08:51,739
Use the website.

1057
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:54,220
What do you mean use the website?

1058
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,939
Let me check and see how my BTC's doing.

1059
01:08:56,939 --> 01:08:59,619
Wait, hold on, I have zero dollars.

1060
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,300
Upgrades, what?

1061
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,140
There's upgrades?

1062
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,460
Hold on, I have to look at this.

1063
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:10,539
Azimuth, rotational speed increase.

1064
01:09:10,539 --> 01:09:11,380
I don't have any money.

1065
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:29,420
Do I get money for this?

1066
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:35,039
Terminal, database, all signals.

1067
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,840
Story signals, random signals.

1068
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:48,159
Play, where is this?

1069
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,000
Executed?

1070
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:09,840
I haven't found anything.

1071
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,060
Well, I'm just gonna go drive the car then.

1072
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,100
It's gonna take like three days to get there

1073
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:21,529
and I'm gonna lose the signal by the time it gets there.

1074
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:52,979
How do I leave out here?

1075
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:59,699
I'm fine, what's that?

1076
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:00,819
Yeah, this does get a full letter grade,

1077
01:11:00,819 --> 01:11:25,979
but what's the point of this?

1078
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:28,460
You can hand crank the radar to have it go faster.

1079
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:43,350
What, am I on Earth?

1080
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:49,850
I'm realizing this is, this is a strange planet.

1081
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,840
Do you hear that?

1082
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,279
It was snow, it was like snow sounds, wasn't it?

1083
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,039
By the way, I don't have a left ear button.

1084
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:01,829
If those of you that, you guys know that.

1085
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:07,649
I do not have a left ear button.

1086
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:14,979
Why is it snowing out here?

1087
01:12:14,979 --> 01:12:16,430
You missed it.

1088
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:20,420
What was it?

1089
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,319
It was exclusively left ear.

1090
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:29,060
It was an alien sound, was it actually?

1091
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,539
One ear butt Andy.

1092
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,409
Why is it all of a sudden accumulation on the ground?

1093
01:12:40,409 --> 01:13:13,899
It just started snowing.

1094
01:13:13,899 --> 01:13:15,180
What the hell is this for?

1095
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:28,319
I found my test.

1096
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,350
Can I climb this?

1097
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,270
Oh, you know, I may have found somebody else's test

1098
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:36,109
that they got scared, they heard Jigsaw,

1099
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:37,390
they threw it out in their golf cart

1100
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:41,380
and just didn't do the test.

1101
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,060
That would just kinda fuck up Jigsaw's whole routine,

1102
01:13:43,060 --> 01:13:45,060
wouldn't it?

1103
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,539
I'm in my golf cart, I'm starting my job.

1104
01:13:46,539 --> 01:13:48,890
There's a recorder under here.

1105
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,729
I pick it up and I press play.

1106
01:13:50,729 --> 01:13:52,880
Hello again, David.

1107
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,739
This is Jigsaw, fuck, just throw it out the window.

1108
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:04,079
I don't know what it is, but I don't wanna know.

1109
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,699
And I would get away from this.

1110
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:11,119
I would go to the doctor immediately.

1111
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,479
I would get every scan.

1112
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,380
Yeah, David, everything looks clean.

1113
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:19,399
Everything?

1114
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:21,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there was a small little thing

1115
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,300
behind the back of your right side of your neck.

1116
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,800
Was it a key?

1117
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,640
No, no, no, no, just a little fatty nodule.

1118
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,539
Not a big deal or anything, it's just pretty normal.

1119
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:38,649
Okay, but then I would be fine.

1120
01:14:38,649 --> 01:14:58,560
What is that in the distance?

1121
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,750
I have to, it's a UFO.

1122
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:06,390
It's a UFO.

1123
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:10,489
I'm gonna go find it.

1124
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:13,409
This is the shittiest version of Independence Day

1125
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:17,659
I've ever seen.

1126
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:18,500
How do we stop them?

1127
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,970
Oh, we have no power.

1128
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,649
Our weapons are useless.

1129
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:27,079
Who's that down on the golf cart?

1130
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:29,710
I'll take care of this.

1131
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:46,029
Aw, I need to look at that, I need to see what that is.

1132
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:48,869
It gets close enough.

1133
01:15:48,909 --> 01:15:52,819
You alien bastards!

1134
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:55,260
And just a small little,

1135
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:56,859
ray just comes out of the front of the UFO

1136
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:59,710
and liquidates this.

1137
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,670
There's no explosion or anything.

1138
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:02,170
There's no, oh my God, what a big death.

1139
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,500
Nope, it just, vaporized, gone.

1140
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:11,140
That person's gone.

1141
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,100
I don't even know where my base is.

1142
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:27,739
All right, I gotta use this telescope and look.

1143
01:16:27,739 --> 01:16:28,619
Oh, come on, really?

1144
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:30,710
I can't, okay.

1145
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,909
Wait, there's a car too.

1146
01:16:31,909 --> 01:16:37,789
Wait, why would I get in that when there's a car?

1147
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:46,520
It's a Tesla truck, it's a cyber truck.

1148
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,840
And there's window breakings.

1149
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,800
This is a joke, right?

1150
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:58,050
They did this on purpose.

1151
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,890
That's pretty funny.

1152
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:04,380
What are they loading in here?

1153
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:13,779
All right, telescope.

1154
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:24,329
Okay, where was that?

1155
01:17:24,329 --> 01:17:40,439
It was like over there somewhere, right?

1156
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:44,720
Is it up?

1157
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,739
I don't see it, what?

1158
01:17:47,739 --> 01:17:50,579
I don't see anything.

1159
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:51,659
It was just the helicopter.

1160
01:17:51,659 --> 01:17:53,220
It was actually the helicopter,

1161
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,079
which is really far away.

1162
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:59,029
Oh, okay.

1163
01:17:59,029 --> 01:17:59,869
All right, let's take a look.

1164
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:02,430
Let's check on my frequency.

1165
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,229
How's it doing?

1166
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:08,619
All right, we are, 323.

1167
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:23,760
We'll go 30, 307.

1168
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,560
Hurry up, what am I doing?

1169
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,159
I'll bring this down to the minimum

1170
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,930
so we can go from minimum to maximum.

1171
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:33,930
Use the website.

1172
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,810
I don't know what you mean, website.

1173
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:41,020
Terminal?

1174
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,449
What website are you talking about?

1175
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:50,909
Use the website.

1176
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:53,460
Dude, that thing is scrolling.

1177
01:18:53,460 --> 01:19:04,560
Radio, use the radio.

1178
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,449
ABC lounge.

1179
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:16,979
Why is this buffering?

1180
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:25,340
Can't even fucking hear it.

1181
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:28,939
Extreme DMCA, actual DMCA.

1182
01:19:28,939 --> 01:19:36,000
Wait, is this for real?

1183
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,079
All right, we're at 316.

1184
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,930
This is a real radio station?

1185
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:51,439
Wait, can you get DMCA'd for a radio station?

1186
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:52,579
You can.

1187
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:56,760
Well, Santa Claus is fucked.

1188
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,439
Every mall Santa just went.

1189
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,359
Worst noise.

1190
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:14,720
What?

1191
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:19,149
What do you mean worst sound?

1192
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:23,750
What?

1193
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:26,949
Oh, I just went gulp with a cat puke sound.

1194
01:20:26,949 --> 01:20:27,829
That's not a big deal.

1195
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:28,670
Do you hear yourself?

1196
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:33,529
No.

1197
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:36,470
No one understood that joke.

1198
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:39,069
I'm saying every mall Santa has just

1199
01:20:39,069 --> 01:20:49,899
the Christmas radio station playing right next to them.

1200
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:53,000
Was that a bad joke?

1201
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,960
That wasn't very funny?

1202
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,000
No, oh well.

1203
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,819
But they're not streaming.

1204
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,020
Oh, yeah, right.

1205
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,380
It's not illegal to listen to music.

1206
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,779
Or will it be eventually?

1207
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,060
There's the deep part of that joke you guys missed.

1208
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:19,140
It went right over your head.

1209
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,560
You have to have a fucking Blizzard authenticator stick

1210
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,979
to stick into your radio to prove

1211
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:27,539
that you can actually listen to that song.

1212
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:28,979
Just wait, just wait.

1213
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:31,939
And then at that point BTC will be $100,000

1214
01:21:31,939 --> 01:21:44,060
and who gives a shit, I'll be a millionaire.

1215
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,590
Well, I'll have one.

1216
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,310
Then I'll probably sell it when it crashes in like a week.

1217
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,789
I don't know, I'm not a financial advisor.

1218
01:21:50,829 --> 01:21:51,670
Don't take any advice from me.

1219
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:52,789
I have no idea what's going on.

1220
01:21:52,789 --> 01:22:10,430
It's fucking, it's insanity.

1221
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,229
I have no signal.

1222
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:14,229
I have no signal again.

1223
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,069
Well, can I get one that's not over 300?

1224
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:21,989
Is it, wait, did I go, is it time to sleep?

1225
01:22:21,989 --> 01:22:23,409
You idiot.

1226
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:28,170
Coordinates, signal simulator on GitHub.

1227
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,029
You guys are linking me a GitHub.

1228
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:36,090
I need to go to a GitHub website to play this game.

1229
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:42,739
Really, you want me to cheat?

1230
01:22:42,739 --> 01:22:45,399
Nope, I'm gonna find one before the stream turns off.

1231
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:54,689
I swear to God.

1232
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:56,250
I need to find one.

1233
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,170
And the second that I find one and it goes,

1234
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:04,670
doot doot, wait, I have money.

1235
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:07,279
I have 20 bucks.

1236
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:13,130
Okay, how about recharge?

1237
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:17,560
Recharge rate upgrade.

1238
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,460
That doesn't seem like very much.

1239
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:28,119
But on the solar panels, 20 big ones, that's right.

1240
01:23:28,119 --> 01:23:29,960
I'll probably do this, how much is it?

1241
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:34,630
30 bucks, I don't have, it's all these are 30.

1242
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:35,670
So let me get this straight.

1243
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:39,500
I'm not getting paid to work right now.

1244
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:44,399
Is that what I'm understanding?

1245
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:49,100
How come I'm not getting paid?

1246
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,460
You only get paid if you do your job.

1247
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,699
How have I not been doing my job?

1248
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:55,180
I've been desperately trying to find these

1249
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,060
needle in a haystack pinpoint coordinates

1250
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:02,000
and I almost got one.

1251
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:10,800
You get paid when you find the aliens.

1252
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,699
Where's the alien?

1253
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:18,640
I don't, I'm looking, what, I,

1254
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,159
just because I haven't found the alien yet

1255
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,000
doesn't mean I don't get paid for the work I'm doing

1256
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:33,090
to try to find the alien?

1257
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,449
All right, let's get a signal.

1258
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:40,159
I've slept.

1259
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:43,189
Where are the results?

1260
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:45,090
I don't know.

1261
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:47,369
I want photos, Jerma, photos of aliens.

1262
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:52,729
What is this, Jade, Spider-Man guy?

1263
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:54,170
This is what he goes into when he realizes

1264
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:57,109
that Spider-Man's just a fucking teenager

1265
01:24:57,109 --> 01:25:04,949
and it's not this big of a conspiracy or anything.

1266
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:07,180
Get those pictures of those aliens.

1267
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:15,180
Parker, I didn't invest $200 billion in this university

1268
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:20,460
to not see results.

1269
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:37,300
And they better be big and they better be green.

1270
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:47,340
I want coordinates, Spider-Man.

1271
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:48,579
Wait, why does he call Peter, wait,

1272
01:25:48,579 --> 01:25:50,500
at this point he knows, right?

1273
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:57,350
Why is he talking to Spider-Man?

1274
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:59,189
Peter Parker just goes in without the mask on

1275
01:26:00,109 --> 01:26:05,579
and he goes into the daily bugle.

1276
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:07,779
I spent two decades following you around,

1277
01:26:07,779 --> 01:26:27,420
God damn it, Parker.

1278
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:28,260
Okay, here we go.

1279
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:43,659
Oh, this.

1280
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:44,500
What do we got?

1281
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:48,590
Why are they all in the hundreds?

1282
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:53,279
100 and a, come on, all right, 148.

1283
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,300
Let's just get the process going right now, 148, go.

1284
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:08,510
We're at 300 fucking hundred, dude.

1285
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,829
I have to go down to like 180?

1286
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:11,739
This is gonna take all night.

1287
01:27:11,739 --> 01:27:13,909
Brack is available.

1288
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:23,239
All right, so if I press this button, what happens?

1289
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:27,449
Just do both at the same time.

1290
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:28,850
Wait, why is it doing that?

1291
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:40,529
It's tracking the coordinate right now.

1292
01:27:40,529 --> 01:27:43,449
Turn up detection.

1293
01:27:43,449 --> 01:27:49,380
Your antenna's not at max efficiency.

1294
01:27:49,380 --> 01:28:03,390
Efficiency is at five.

1295
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:07,109
Aliens don't omega low exist, dumbass.

1296
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:13,199
All right, but why is my system efficiency so low?

1297
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:21,539
Do I have to like recharge the battery or something?

1298
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:26,539
How do I recharge a university research facility's battery?

1299
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
Go to the solar panels and clean them?

1300
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,159
Oh, come on.

1301
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,239
You actually aren't, that's actually for real.

1302
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:38,159
You really mean that?

1303
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,520
That's really what I have to do.

1304
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,010
I have to go clean the solar panels.

1305
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:49,149
Where are the solar panels?

1306
01:28:49,149 --> 01:28:51,189
They're covered in snow.

1307
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:58,189
Oh, please.

1308
01:28:58,189 --> 01:29:04,869
But where are they?

1309
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:06,189
Are they on the, how do I get up?

1310
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:07,109
Where are these solar panels?

1311
01:29:07,109 --> 01:29:15,380
They're on the left?

1312
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,300
Like down there?

1313
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,470
How do I get up?

1314
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:33,819
Oh, for the love of God.

1315
01:29:33,819 --> 01:29:42,180
Where's my car?

1316
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:49,750
No, my other car.

1317
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:53,840
What was that?

1318
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:09,930
That was me, okay.

1319
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:12,260
Okay, let's go.

1320
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:16,090
Cybertruck, oh my God, Cybertruck Pog.

1321
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:19,460
Are you serious?

1322
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:25,819
Get in your Cybertruck and drink your Heul.

1323
01:30:25,819 --> 01:30:28,960
I like Heul, I don't care if you hate me.

1324
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:35,579
How do I clean this?

1325
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,500
This is not solar panels, this is like a grain mill.

1326
01:30:40,500 --> 01:31:00,649
That's not a solar panel.

1327
01:31:00,649 --> 01:31:02,289
Oh, I forgot, all right, solar panels, let's go.

1328
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:04,840
Clean them off.

1329
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:08,949
The splash light makes things worse.

1330
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:11,020
Open and close the door.

1331
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:17,579
Start the cleaning system.

1332
01:31:17,579 --> 01:31:19,550
The cleaning?

1333
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:24,770
System efficiency, 0.9%.

1334
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,500
What happens if that goes to zero?

1335
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,949
Don't press it, what?

1336
01:31:31,949 --> 01:31:39,720
What do you mean, it's nighttime?

1337
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:46,640
I can't clean at night?

1338
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,819
Solar panels do not work at night.

1339
01:31:49,819 --> 01:31:53,619
But they still take in the electricity.

1340
01:31:53,619 --> 01:32:03,479
They take in electricity?

1341
01:32:03,479 --> 01:32:10,819
I have 0.1% battery?

1342
01:32:10,819 --> 01:32:13,020
Oh shit, a huge raid just came in.

1343
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,819
Who just raided?

1344
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:15,899
Who just raided?

1345
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:17,569
Who just raided?

1346
01:32:17,569 --> 01:32:19,619
This Connor Eats Pants.

1347
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:22,819
With like 5 fucking thousand people.

1348
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:24,939
Welcome everybody, what's up?

1349
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,770
How's everybody doing?

1350
01:32:27,770 --> 01:32:30,859
Welcome to the stream.

1351
01:32:30,899 --> 01:32:32,890
My name's German985.

1352
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,960
What's your name?

1353
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,239
Don't write, just write like your handle in the chat.

1354
01:32:37,239 --> 01:32:38,939
Don't write your name.

1355
01:32:38,939 --> 01:32:41,369
Make one up.

1356
01:32:41,369 --> 01:32:42,449
I have to sing the raid song.

1357
01:32:42,449 --> 01:32:44,050
No, we don't do raid songs anymore.

1358
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:49,350
That's how you delete a thousand people in one second.

1359
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:53,500
Can I just stand here until morning?

1360
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,260
Oh, thanks for the raid, welcome guys.

1361
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:59,220
Hope you had a good stream, whatever you were doing.

1362
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,840
I'm trying to figure out how to contact aliens.

1363
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,979
But wait, wait, wait, wait, here we go.

1364
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:10,020
Would this work?

1365
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:12,460
You know that in an M. Night Shyamalan movie,

1366
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,090
this would work at some point.

1367
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:23,979
This would be a huge thing.

1368
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:31,189
All right, let me check.

1369
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:33,350
Oh, God damn it, I have to go to sleep.

1370
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:34,270
What the fuck?

1371
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:40,460
I don't want...

1372
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:43,949
3,000 people left because you didn't sing the raid song.

1373
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:45,949
I'm not singing any raid songs, not anymore.

1374
01:33:45,949 --> 01:33:47,270
Nonsense, it got nominated.

1375
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:50,460
There's a UFO right there.

1376
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:52,539
There's a UFO right there.

1377
01:33:52,539 --> 01:33:54,250
There's a UFO right there.

1378
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,090
That's not a helicopter.

1379
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:56,770
I saw the circular angle on it.

1380
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:59,329
That's not a, that is a UFO.

1381
01:33:59,329 --> 01:34:02,739
All right, remember where that is.

1382
01:34:02,739 --> 01:34:03,560
Where's my house?

1383
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,600
Where's my base?

1384
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:15,489
It's back this way, over there.

1385
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:16,890
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.

1386
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,670
What's this?

1387
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:21,550
Turn on, I don't know what I just did.

1388
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:23,020
Turn that off?

1389
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:36,439
Should I turn this off?

1390
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:37,920
All right, where was the, where was the UFO?

1391
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:44,449
It was right there somewhere.

1392
01:34:44,449 --> 01:34:46,109
It's gone, what the fuck?

1393
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:55,300
Hold on, hold on, hold on, I'm gonna see, I'm gonna see.

1394
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:59,229
There it is, there it is.

1395
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:00,909
Where'd it go?

1396
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:11,220
Where'd it go?

1397
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,890
Hold on, whatever.

1398
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:17,460
All right, am I coordinates ready?

1399
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,560
I just need, I need to sleep so I can,

1400
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,989
to go clean the stupid solar panels.

1401
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:26,729
You have a dirty monitor.

1402
01:35:26,729 --> 01:35:28,510
I kinda do, you don't need to rest right now.

1403
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:34,159
What am I supposed to do?

1404
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:41,329
Okay, we are at two, why is it still spinning?

1405
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:51,060
Oh, I had track coordinates on.

1406
01:35:51,060 --> 01:36:00,789
So this thing's just been, I've just been using energy.

1407
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:06,399
No wonder I can't even turn the TV on in my house.

1408
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:11,760
I used it all up just spinning this thing in a circle.

1409
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,899
You need at least 50% efficiency to do anything.

1410
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:14,899
Oh God.

1411
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:24,989
I can't sleep either.

1412
01:36:24,989 --> 01:36:26,149
Lock the doors.

1413
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:27,590
Change difficulty to the azimuth

1414
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:48,039
and elevation trackers update in real time.

1415
01:36:48,039 --> 01:36:50,140
Yeah.

1416
01:36:52,909 --> 01:37:00,579
It didn't even give me,

1417
01:37:00,579 --> 01:37:01,819
I think I'm starting detection mode to update

1418
01:37:01,819 --> 01:37:04,119
only when the internet finishes rotating.

1419
01:37:04,119 --> 01:37:05,220
Oh, fuck that.

1420
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:09,199
That's not even how it works in the real world.

1421
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:13,939
This is not even how this works in real life.

1422
01:37:13,939 --> 01:37:15,939
If you tune something or, what,

1423
01:37:15,939 --> 01:37:19,220
you have to wait till you get to the end?

1424
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:20,500
When you're sitting at your car radio

1425
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,899
and you use the tuner,

1426
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:23,659
you don't have a silent fucking radio

1427
01:37:23,659 --> 01:37:27,050
until you reach like 91.2.

1428
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,350
That's not how it works.

1429
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:29,189
You hear it.

1430
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:32,710
You hear the frequency, you hear the noise.

1431
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:33,949
You get to hear them in real time.

1432
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:34,789
That's how it works.

1433
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:45,640
These things are worth like $500 billion.

1434
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,479
You're right.

1435
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:54,069
Aliens will be found tomorrow.

1436
01:37:54,069 --> 01:37:54,909
All right, here we go.

1437
01:37:54,909 --> 01:37:55,729
Let's do it.

1438
01:37:55,729 --> 01:37:58,340
I'm ready.

1439
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:00,020
Everything's at max efficiency.

1440
01:38:00,020 --> 01:38:04,920
Configuring the ISAPNP file system up.

1441
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,340
Did that just say imminent shutdown?

1442
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,180
All right, here we go.

1443
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:08,020
Scanner.

1444
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:22,829
I'm ready.

1445
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:28,699
I want this shit in real time the way that it is.

1446
01:38:28,699 --> 01:38:41,310
Analyze that planet, please.

1447
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:42,250
Name this planet.

1448
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:55,329
Balthazar.

1449
01:38:55,369 --> 01:39:09,520
Balthazar dash one, two.

1450
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,800
Planets are so far away

1451
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,479
and you want to see them instantly.

1452
01:39:13,479 --> 01:39:14,960
It's a, this is not,

1453
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,449
I'm not actually in a research facility.

1454
01:39:19,449 --> 01:39:23,149
This is a, this is pretend.

1455
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,810
Okay, now I got that.

1456
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,050
It's time to, let's find that frequency.

1457
01:39:27,050 --> 01:39:28,649
Auto scan, please.

1458
01:39:28,649 --> 01:39:44,859
Can't, it's all right.

1459
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:47,500
What is the exact speed of light?

1460
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,840
Is it like 10,000 miles per hour?

1461
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,680
It's an easy number to say.

1462
01:39:51,680 --> 01:40:05,859
I'm just gonna say that.

1463
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:09,890
Add it, add it.

1464
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,970
No, give it back.

1465
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:20,409
Got it, got it, got it.

1466
01:40:20,409 --> 01:40:22,250
Give it back.

1467
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:23,090
Use auto?

1468
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:24,470
I can't.

1469
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:30,109
Doesn't do anything.

1470
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:40,250
What's the speed of light?

1471
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,090
I would walk 10,000 miles

1472
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:46,770
and I would walk 10,000 more.

1473
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:51,149
Just to be the man who would walk 1,000 miles

1474
01:40:51,149 --> 01:40:52,529
to fall down at,

1475
01:40:52,529 --> 01:40:55,939
you've already, we talked about this, right?

1476
01:40:55,939 --> 01:40:57,779
You would walk like five miles, get tired,

1477
01:40:57,779 --> 01:40:58,600
and then just be like, you know what?

1478
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,159
I'm just gonna drive there.

1479
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:02,000
This is too much.

1480
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:09,800
Here we go, got it.

1481
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,279
I would walk 1,000 miles.

1482
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,159
No, I would not.

1483
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,800
I would not.

1484
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,680
I would walk a few and then I would,

1485
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,000
here's what I would do.

1486
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,130
I would walk for like 10 minutes

1487
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:30,270
and realize what I was doing was really stupid.

1488
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:33,149
To put forth the illusion that I did so,

1489
01:41:33,149 --> 01:41:35,229
I would just get the clothes I was wearing.

1490
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:37,149
I would like roll them into the dirt a little bit.

1491
01:41:37,149 --> 01:41:38,350
I would take a little bit of like dirt

1492
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:39,470
and like rub it in my hands,

1493
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:40,430
like rub it on my face.

1494
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:43,189
I look like cartoon character style.

1495
01:41:44,029 --> 01:41:47,310
Like I got attacked by a shot with like a cartoon shotgun.

1496
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,779
You know what I mean?

1497
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:50,619
Mess up my hair, shit load.

1498
01:41:50,619 --> 01:41:51,579
This is a family guy joke.

1499
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:52,420
What the fuck?

1500
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,239
Are you kidding me?

1501
01:41:53,239 --> 01:41:54,399
I can't even tell a joke anymore

1502
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,600
and it's like already a family guy routine.

1503
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:07,529
They, whatever.

1504
01:42:07,529 --> 01:42:08,609
What do we got for a signal?

1505
01:42:08,609 --> 01:42:10,890
I'm really, come on.

1506
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:16,659
All right, 149, 10, go.

1507
01:42:16,659 --> 01:42:22,000
On, E, E, turn it on.

1508
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:29,319
Turn this thing on.

1509
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:33,840
All right, 149, 10.

1510
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,840
I'm gonna go 140, 10, go.

1511
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,800
Let's go, spin.

1512
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1513
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:45,909
and I'm gonna put a ton of power into this.

1514
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:51,529
There we go, better.

1515
01:42:51,529 --> 01:42:58,289
Oh Jesus, it can take all day.

1516
01:42:58,289 --> 01:43:05,460
I'm gonna lose the signal by the time it gets there.

1517
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:07,050
Why would they,

1518
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:09,380
how are you even supposed to do this?

1519
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:11,180
I have to go clean, this is a new game.

1520
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,220
The solar panels are nice and they're fine.

1521
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:18,720
I'm at 99% efficiency.

1522
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,319
It's gonna take like all day.

1523
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,939
Go explore in the snow.

1524
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:43,640
No, I'm gonna get this, I'm gonna get this.

1525
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,520
Worst, this is not the worst stream of 2021.

1526
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:48,260
Just wait till fucking like a month from now.

1527
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:50,840
You'll be begging for this to come back

1528
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,140
when I play like golf simulator 2.

1529
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:09,210
You'll be begging for this to come back.

1530
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:10,970
All right, no real time data yet.

1531
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:18,149
We're getting closer.

1532
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:20,670
All right, so we're gonna go from 140,

1533
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:24,630
we're gonna go to 188 and then 42.

1534
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:32,880
188 to 42.

1535
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:40,699
Looking at that elevation right now.

1536
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:42,140
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

1537
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:43,420
It was 19, 19.

1538
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:48,989
19, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1539
01:44:48,989 --> 01:45:00,529
19 and then this one was that's not we got that one ready one. We're gonna go up to

1540
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:24,479
One like 60 and he said I can't read this you can't why did I can't wait for during the catboy stream from like

1541
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,569
I'm gonna put up like a fake cat foot and like

1542
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:36,550
Behind my right ear on camera you guys are gonna fucking freak out. I missed it. What was it?

1543
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:54,500
Spoilers oh, I got a lot of spoilers for you if you want to hear. Oh, just wait for that you guys

1544
01:45:54,979 --> 01:46:02,420
Guys I think that you're not gonna like that straight. Just wait alright now. We gotta go to 180 so it was 19

1545
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:09,829
We're gonna go to 20. We'll do

1546
01:46:09,829 --> 01:46:21,010
2020 I don't know

1547
01:46:22,010 --> 01:46:45,170
Where are we 165 165 21? Oh fuck 165 17 165 17 come on. Oh you idiot

1548
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:55,260
165 17 oh my god pay attention shit. It was 18. I fucking hate these dials

1549
01:46:56,539 --> 01:46:59,680
18 160 I

1550
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:15,390
Can hate these dials with passion why can't it be a knob one knob we are adding one 60

1551
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:22,470
165.3. Oh, please

1552
01:47:23,899 --> 01:47:34,079
164.9. I read it there it is elevation 18 point 18 point 2. I hear some new noise

1553
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:56,600
18 point 4. Oh boy. I got quiet 18 point 5 18 point 4. We got it 18 point 4 5 18 point 4 7

1554
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:17,079
18 point 4 5 18 point 4 4 18 point 4 3 was that

1555
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:57,920
Waiting for data to be downloaded download it a video. What happened waiting for wait? Oh my goodness

1556
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:08,300
What is this shit coordinates and then upgrades modules energy solar panels energy distribution calibration?

1557
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:36,930
How do I download the data? Oh, it's downloading. It's right now. It's downloading. This is a one gigabyte of alien Zorn

1558
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:48,409
Go to the power. Oh, yeah, let's let's don't quick. I gotta download quick. I need more

1559
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:58,250
Server server put more download power. There we go. I increased my fucking speeds a little bit

1560
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:29,199
I need to shut this off. This is annoying 50% incoming. This is dedicated Wham planet type

1561
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:34,239
This is called Trojan planet and it's called fast radio burst

1562
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:50,000
If 60% drink some of that coffee right now

1563
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:09,600
66% fast radio burst. It's a bursting Trojan

1564
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:30,979
Alien Zorn, I guess this is pretty fast

1565
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:37,250
What internet provider is this five megs a second downloading from?

1566
01:51:38,439 --> 01:51:46,090
500 billion light years away. That's really good. The ping on this download is probably like

1567
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:55,770
600 million. In fact, I probably had I probably already downloaded this like 30 years in the future

1568
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:59,850
Right or like 20 years ago by now, right? How that has time works weirdly when you do it going through

1569
01:52:00,229 --> 01:52:06,670
Like light speed and stuff what would happen, right?

1570
01:52:06,989 --> 01:52:12,310
I downloaded this now and I started the download like 10 million years in the future, right?

1571
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:18,090
How does that work because I activate the download now

1572
01:52:18,409 --> 01:52:23,270
It goes to do that to pull it but 50 million light years away

1573
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:43,649
But it would take like oh no, it took a million years to me to get it, right radio is light dumbass

1574
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:50,220
Okay, professor. Wait, wait, wait

1575
01:52:50,939 --> 01:53:02,020
That's not even right. That's not even accurate ready. Okay decoding complete. I got the message decoded data is oh

1576
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:17,340
Great all this bullshit to have picked up like the end of a barcode on a single banana

1577
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:34,260
Fantastic. How much does this facility cost? How do I bring this up to my supervisor? Right? I bring it

1578
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:38,390
Look at this call. We got a secret code. Oh, we're gonna put it through all of our machines

1579
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:47,020
Let's see what that is and think it put it in the machine and it's like one Chiquita banana 40 cents

1580
01:53:47,020 --> 01:54:06,850
Okay, do I get fired immediately? What do I do with this now? Just get this shit out of me. What do I do with this?

1581
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:17,189
I have this decoded data. What do I do with the decoded data? Oh shit

1582
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:55,449
Oh, I play it you can get this exact same audio holding a microphone up to the wall

1583
01:54:55,449 --> 01:55:00,090
If you have a neighbor that shares a wall while they're currently watching Monday night football

1584
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:23,979
I don't think we found anything very spectacular. Wait, that's not that's just the sounds that's going on in the room. Wait, what?

1585
01:55:23,979 --> 01:55:41,289
Hold on. The alien is watching Monday night football. Oh shit. All right, cool. So what did I get any money?

1586
01:55:44,359 --> 01:55:46,359
$240

1587
01:55:47,619 --> 01:55:58,050
$240 for that upgrade the rotation please and oh what I was gonna do a cooling no more more charging

1588
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:19,819
What else should I do efficiency lower the energy consumption? Yep twice fracking reduce the consumption of electronics. Yep. All right

1589
01:56:19,819 --> 01:56:41,180
We're good. I did it. I got my first alien. I got my first alien. I thought that was a gas can

1590
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:56,529
How do I not need to sleep? I haven't slept in like three days like the bathroom

1591
01:56:56,529 --> 01:57:12,420
Why does everybody keep saying this is an alien climb out of the bathtub eventually? I'm sure it does

1592
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:30,210
That's a weird place for toilet paper. I did that one time. I don't know what happened

1593
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:32,130
I got stuck in a fucking light. I got like jumped it

1594
01:57:32,130 --> 01:57:43,869
I got jump into a light speed wormhole there didn't wash hands. I didn't do anything

1595
01:57:47,279 --> 01:57:53,760
No, I didn't know I didn't wash my hands cuz I sat on the top of the ceramic part of the toilet and then flushed it

1596
01:57:53,760 --> 01:58:10,170
I didn't touch it. I didn't like touch if I didn't touch anything. I didn't do anything. What planet was that?

1597
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:33,720
Okay, it's time for another frequency I can't wait scanner

1598
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:40,920
You know, I'm thinking I'm thinking up here. There'll be some aliens up this way. I'm really feeling top-right

1599
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:52,090
veto this

1600
01:58:52,090 --> 01:59:00,199
I'm about to cross like the steam refund threshold. So therefore I'm not no that's not happening

1601
01:59:00,199 --> 01:59:04,479
It's too late one hour and 59 minutes and 58 seconds of its

1602
01:59:05,319 --> 01:59:10,380
Happy new year. It's been exactly two hours. I can no longer refund the game. Happy new year. Happy refund new year

1603
01:59:10,859 --> 01:59:32,479
Well, you should have why did you not bring that up to me an hour ago? You made no progress

1604
01:59:32,479 --> 01:59:36,319
I just I just solved the case of a secret alien planet. Yes

1605
01:59:36,359 --> 01:59:37,680
I did. I just got $200

1606
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:47,020
I just cracked the case of an alien planet in two hours. It takes scientists like 30 years to do this shit

1607
01:59:47,739 --> 01:59:56,949
Imagine being upset that the scientists that you just hired in two hours found an alien planet. I

1608
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:01,420
Really wanted you to do that in like 20 minutes

1609
02:00:01,979 --> 02:00:12,850
Come on, where is it? This is a super high frequency

1610
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:19,390
Scientists haven't found aliens yet. Okay, you believe that then I don't know what to tell you

1611
02:00:19,789 --> 02:00:24,590
They've been in communication with aliens for like the last fucking 400 years 500 years

1612
02:00:34,909 --> 02:00:37,149
You get you guys didn't say like, you know

1613
02:00:37,470 --> 02:00:41,590
John alien signed the Declaration of Independence, but they fucking whited it out

1614
02:00:41,829 --> 02:00:53,930
They didn't want people to know get a big powdered wig on they photoshopped him out of all the photos by this point

1615
02:00:54,250 --> 02:01:07,060
Yeah, John Quincy alien

1616
02:01:11,369 --> 02:01:34,189
They just what do you want me to tell you wrong way? What come on? Yes. All right, what we got

1617
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:38,869
41

1618
02:01:38,869 --> 02:01:50,970
56 let's give it a try

1619
02:01:51,130 --> 02:02:02,210
Go are you still playing this huh? There it is the two-hour mark somebody in pre-streams chat said

1620
02:02:02,409 --> 02:02:09,649
We're gonna pick this in pre-stream and in two hours exactly. We're gonna start seeing why is he still playing this right on the dot

1621
02:02:09,649 --> 02:02:13,369
They were right in two hours. Exactly. Here it comes. Oh

1622
02:02:15,449 --> 02:02:22,260
I gotta hold on power. Oh, no, it's already there

1623
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:27,439
Still playing this

1624
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:30,590
We're looking for 44

1625
02:02:31,029 --> 02:02:39,970
Alright, let's just keep an eye on it. Stop being mean to this game. I love it. I'm not being I'm I'm having fun

1626
02:02:40,409 --> 02:02:49,949
When did I say I didn't like this game? I just said that I was I needed a better tutorial and what's with the paragraph?

1627
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:55,789
That's the only good wait. The only complaint I've had so far guys is the extreme paragraph space. That's it

1628
02:02:55,789 --> 02:03:14,600
Oh, and I hate the knobs or something, right? Whatever. That's not a big deal in the panels. What are we at 61%?

1629
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:18,859
I'll do that today after I find this I'm gonna scan it and we're gonna watch the video

1630
02:03:18,859 --> 02:03:29,960
Oh shit, look at this. It's got from back from pooping for an hour

1631
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,000
Is he still playing the science homework video game?

1632
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,039
I would probably make an appointment with like a you you go into that for an hour

1633
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:54,149
Wait, hold on this important was your computer in there because of that then that's fine drink some water

1634
02:03:54,149 --> 02:04:05,329
Yeah, but if you what it was a switch that counts too. That's fine. The video is of the poop slowly

1635
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:26,869
Look at it can't look at it you fucking weirdo. Are we getting there?

1636
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,579

Almost there nice job, dude up stuff stuff stuff up stuff stuff stuff alright now. We're just gonna do elevation

02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:33,399
We're at now 53 elevation is 58 to 89 okay, so let's go

1645
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:41,510
Let's go for it. You can find something stop diluting yourself this game sucks

1646
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:59,560
Everyone knows that it's a meme game where all you do is I know that person's upset about this and that guy no

1647
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:03,899
If I ban him for having an opinion he's just he doesn't like this game

1648

But still relax we already banned him. No. I'm kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm having it. I like this game

1652
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:46,140
It's fun. It's fun. Just sit and look at a number go up not a game with the simulator. It's a video game

1653
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:58,300
It's a video game refund. I'm not why would I refund it? I'm I've been joining myself

1654
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:01,310

1655
02:07:04,579 --> 02:07:07,180
6566

1656
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:11,319
I'm so glad I turned on the easy mode. This would have been hell

1657
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:13,960
6970

1658
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:44,750
Really really really really weird okay even more than 80. Hold on a second

1659
02:07:44,750 --> 02:08:01,529
I'm at 83 right now. I miss it. Did I miss it was it back down like 60 on really

1660
02:08:01,529 --> 02:08:15,479
No, it was not go to 90, but no max is 89

1661
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:33,050
I like the part when the number was 60.1. Oh cool. I mean it was pretty cool

1662
02:08:33,130 --> 02:08:40,859
Let's call when it was that number for like a second or so. I don't know. Oh, yeah

1663
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:54,380
87 got it. I can't believe people didn't like that. We got one thing thought that was gonna be a huge hit 88 89

1664
02:08:55,020 --> 02:09:25,430
There it is. We got it waiting for binary data. Let's go play the video. There's no video. Oh shit. Okay, hold on

1665
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:36,720
While this downloads I gotta go clean the stuff downloading

1666
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:59,810
Clean the solar panels. I'll be right back stop beating around the bush this game sucks. Give us catboy

1667
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:13,649
You'll get catboy when you get it you'll get catboy when you get catboy not a second sooner, okay

1668
02:10:13,649 --> 02:10:32,600
How we doing 60% efficiency clean press F to start the cleaning system. Did I charge efficiency 100% F F F F?

1669
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:55,439
Why is everything F did that work? It's going back up. All right. We're good. That's cuz I said F

1670
02:10:55,439 --> 02:11:03,140
Oh, well, I'm forever messed up just because of all the internet problems. I had over the last three or four years

1671
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:07,229
It's being on fiber now every time I see the word F

1672
02:11:07,229 --> 02:11:26,619
I just go wait my internet my internet must be done internet sound cool looking like dog F is for fiber dip shit

1673
02:11:26,739 --> 02:11:38,649
Stop it. I would do another download 39. That's it. Come on

1674
02:11:41,989 --> 02:11:47,039
This like brings me back to when I used to go back on a 56k modem

1675
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:56,750
I would download like stone-cold stunning people from like wrestling websites and a pixelated

1676
02:11:57,229 --> 02:12:06,430
160p video of a four-second clip of stone-cold stunning Ken Shamrock. I had a whole folder of

1677
02:12:06,789 --> 02:12:28,140
Stuns and rock bottoms and people's elbows and shit. It's like four hours to download them at a time watch a stunner compilation

1678
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:36,680
You just told me how old you are. There was no such thing as a stunner compilation. You guys have it

1679
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:39,289
So good, you had to individually download

1680
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:46,569
Stone cold stuns undertaker. It was eight seconds long and it took four hours to download

1681
02:12:46,569 --> 02:12:50,359
You didn't get to watch it. You didn't get to preview it

1682
02:12:50,359 --> 02:12:56,640
It was a file you had to download onto your computer and then open it in Windows and no open it in Quicktime

1683
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:21,109
Your kids and your compilation videos. Yeah, I meant do it now. What like you mean on stream? Okay. Well, sorry

1684
02:13:21,109 --> 02:13:28,520
I got a little upset that you just attacked me. Oh, that's just like we said of what we had

1685
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:32,380
We asked grandpa how he was doing grandpa. How are you?

1686
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:45,199
We used to have to download four hours to get a stone cold stunner and it sucked and there was no such thing as Amazon

1687
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:49,829
If you wanted a package you had to send it with your own bare hands

1688
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:58,140
You're just shot put it as far as you could into the fucking ocean and hope one of the dolphins picked it up and brought it

1689
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:07,239
To your destination. Sorry. Yeah, that did happen. I just got like charcoal all over my hands

1690
02:14:07,239 --> 02:14:15,840
What I just touched the bottom of my chair. What the hell happened is this like tar on my hands because I touched the bottom of my seat

1691
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:20,210
I underneath with like the metal part is I just grabbed it and was like

1692
02:14:20,829 --> 02:14:25,430
Touching it and gripping it. I don't know why I just was leave me alone. I'd wash my hands every break

1693
02:14:25,430 --> 02:18:45,680
Hi there. Yeah, I had some water. I went to the bathroom. Let's keep going

1696
02:19:04,170 --> 02:19:08,590
Have I aged that much in three years? Maybe it is a throwback

1697
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:16,260

1698
02:19:16,260 --> 02:19:18,260

1708
02:21:20,250 --> 02:21:36,799
Clear the chat and clear the account because that's what would happen permanently. So no, this is the worst chat

1709
02:21:36,799 --> 02:21:44,729
I've ever seen. I don't know. I don't believe that we go

Witch theme song with the lyrics on it. Just that first like sacred hearts are having so much. I can't get it out of my head. Just the woman singing part. I can't stop. It won't leave me alone. Just that first. What are the actual lyrics? First sentence. Colors weave into a spiral of flame. What's the next part? What does that even mean? Nothing about past. Distant past called to a past still unnamed. Colors weave into a spiral of flame. Distant hearts called to a past

1716
02:26:03,780 --> 02:27:05,139
still unnamed. Colors weave into a spiral of flame. Distant sparks called to a past still unnamed. Bear this torch against the cold of the night. Search your soul and reawaken the undying light. I don't know what any of that means. You've sung this song like eight times. Do you think I don't? I'm aware of that. That doesn't mean I have to keep having it in my head. Scanner, please. That's your. Every event has led up to this point in your life. Are you happy? Yeah.

1717
02:27:05,139 --> 02:28:02,040
I'm doing pretty good. I'm good. I'm alright. I have schematics. Check the module. I will after I scan. Sacred flame to a past still unnamed. Distant voice through the song of the. I don't know. I've already lost it. You just gave it to me and I don't even know what the lyrics are again. It could be anything. It could be just a jumble of words sung to that tune. Oh, I got it. Alright, modules. Modules can be upgrading by downloading module schematics from a signal or analyzing, right? When a module schematic is downloaded, it will be up.

1718
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:30,909
It will upgrade a random module. OK. Well, what did I get? I how did I slow mode Andy? Oh, stop. Oh, no, no. You're talking about. OK, you're talking about me. Yeah, that's 13000 people here. You don't think there's going to be a slow mode on for like a few minutes or a second or two.

1719
02:28:31,229 --> 02:29:03,719
All right, let's get that frequency. Got it locked in. It's your birthday today. Baldi, Baldi, happy birthday to you. I hope you have a good birthday today. That's Baldi in the chat.

1720
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:32,680
263 18 to far away 1263 18 and I'll lose this signal, guarantee it. Guarantee I lose this one. That's power doing 65 percent efficiency.

1721
02:29:42,270 --> 02:30:04,600
My birthday. Put the music slider up. I can't. So you can hear the decoded message. Oh, happy. Thanks for the birthday present. I don't hear anything.

1722
02:30:12,389 --> 02:30:36,649
Oh, I'm going to sing happy birthday to you, but I'm going to replace a word in there with binary. Happy one zero one one zero one zero to you. Happy one zero zero one zero one one zero zero to you. Happy one zero one one zero zero one zero.

1723
02:30:37,469 --> 02:30:46,649
Dear Baldi, happy one zero zero one zero one zero to you.

1724
02:30:46,889 --> 02:31:04,549
Rude. I was calling somebody Baldi. That'd be so fucking evil. That'd be so mean. But that's their username.

1725
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:22,469
Is that even their username? Did I get it wrong? It's not their username? Yes, it is. It's Baldi.

1726
02:31:23,620 --> 02:32:04,780
Not. Shit. It was Bradley. It was Bold Bradley. What did I say? Yeah, but I said the Bald Baldi. I'm sorry. That's not your name, but happy birthday to you. Nonetheless, it's

1727
02:32:06,719 --> 02:32:40,040
their name. It's Bold Bradley, not Bald Bald Baldi. Bold Bradley. Bold. What's their name? What's this person's name? Boldy Bradley. Boldy Badly. Boldy Badly. Not Bald Bradley. Not Bold Bradley. Not Bald Badly. Boldly Badly. Happy birthday. Not Bald Baldi. Bold.

1728
02:32:40,040 --> 02:33:42,780
Shit, whatever. The chat is going so fast. I can't fucking read it sometimes, man. All right, where are we going? I got pretty good efficiency right now. 65. And that's the reason why we have slow mode. Can you imagine without slow mode, I would never read anything. Go outside. Oh, fine. Read this, I'll shit my pants. I hope you don't do that. Don't do that shit. It's not like who is going to. That's not funny for anyone. That's not like we're just going to. That's a bad idea. Why would you do something like that?

1729
02:33:42,819 --> 02:34:53,159
That's not a smart idea. Don't do that. Like, don't take anything I ever say literally. And don't you say something literally that you're going to do if I say a certain phrase. Don't give yourself secret slime actions to do terrible things if I say them. If he says the word gazuntite, I'm going to shit my pants. Don't. Don't. Don't do that. Why are you doing that? I don't know. Just don't do that. Just watch. Just watch the stream and hang on. Here it is again. That doesn't remember the secret slime action stream. Yeah, you don't. Oh, I mean like 80% of you weren't

1730
02:34:53,159 --> 02:36:01,479
here probably. That's like circa 2015, 2016 or something. Wasn't that long ago? Oh, yeah, it was. That was at least three, four years ago. It was 2019. What are you talking about? Oh, oh, okay. You're talking about. Okay. I thought you meant the original one with me and Star from like 2015. Right. Okay. You're talking about the one with the slime, the actual slime. Okay. 260. We're at 295. Pull it back. Let's go. So we're looking for 260 to 320. We should be able to get a little bit of a view here. Keep an eye on that as you

1731
02:36:01,479 --> 02:37:13,829
move. I've missed it. 291. Stop. 290. Stop. 290. 290. 290. 289. Hmm. Interesting. 289.7. 289.5. 289.288. 288.2. That's not moving. 283. What's happening? Let's do the stupid other one. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. 289. Oh, come on. 289.

1732
02:37:13,829 --> 02:37:39,870
Come on. 291. Close. 292. Pogchamp. Where's Pogchamp? Pogchamp. Pogchamp. What are you talking about? Pogchamp is gone. Pogchamp is deleted. Enable Pogchamp. I didn't turn it off.

1733
02:37:39,870 --> 02:38:25,120
Come on. Really? 291. The decimals. Oh, stop it. Stop trying to do elevation. I don't care about elevation right now. They removed Pogchamp. How am I missing this shit? Where is it?

1734
02:38:27,000 --> 02:39:03,049
290. All right. There it is. 290.80. 290.75. Okay. Now we just need elevation. Germovenus. Well, now you have to use Germovenus. Pogchamp gone. Where did it go? It was right there.

1735
02:39:03,049 --> 02:39:24,149
Well, now you're just going to have to use Germovenus. Don't refresh. Hey, just don't refresh and it won't be gone. Thinking face. There you go.

1736
02:39:24,149 --> 02:40:11,840
All right. We're looking for 31. We're going to go down. Way down. But you have to pay for Germovenus. Enable Pogchamp. I didn't turn it off. I don't know what happened. Twitch turned off Pogchamp. He did it. It was him.

1737
02:40:11,840 --> 02:41:01,030
All right. Elevation. 38. 37. I'm ready to pause. 36. 35. 34. 33. 32. 31. Got it. Download that shit right now. Quickly before I lose signal. Put it all to the server. Download.

1738
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:45,309
What are they going to replace it with? Are they going to replace it with another Pogchamp? Who replaces the Pogchamp? What do you do? 1.6 megabit second. Yeah, that sucks. 8% download. That's so bad. It's going to be you. It's not going to be me.

1739
02:41:45,309 --> 02:42:43,790
Pogchamp is undergoing maintenance where it comes back as another guy. Is it just going to be another guy? So are we going to get Pogchamp when it's like not Pog? It's going to be like a different guy. Or will they even bring it back? Is it time to shine? Is it time to stand up and be like, hey, is everybody going to come out here and start saying, hey, I got a Pogchamp on my channel? Every single fucking Twitch streamer has their own version of Pogchamp. We're all vying for this space now. All of us.

1740
02:42:43,790 --> 02:43:24,719
It is now every man for himself, every woman for himself to become the new Pogchamp. There is not a single person on this whole website that does not have a Pogchamp version of themself. I'm open for nominations here. It's not going to be me. I'm not going to win. It could be slug Pog.

1741
02:43:24,719 --> 02:44:13,840
It's going to be so many. Oh my God, I can already see it. Who's going to be the new Pogchamp? I mean, if there's like a tournament of Pogchamps before that. Let me see.

1742
02:44:49,680 --> 02:45:35,879
Holy shit, what the fuck is going on? Well, I mean, I know about the stuff that's going on in the Capitol right now. But I know all of us know that that shit's going on. And it's been pretty stressful and pretty horrible to see. But I figured I would just want to try to pivot away from it and kind of at least escape for a little while. So I haven't really spoken on it at all.

1743
02:45:35,879 --> 02:46:19,309
Let's just have fun. It's obviously fucking awful what's going on. We're going to continue to look for aliens, right? Yeah, this is wild. They're going to be a new Pogchamp or something. But I mean, I don't know what it's going to be. I have no idea what they're going to do. What are they even going to do?

1744
02:46:19,309 --> 02:47:05,459
Yeah, I spent the whole morning pretty much going like, what the fuck is going on right now? What the fuck are you doing? What is going on? Remember, for president. No, no, that's not going to. No, no, no, no, no, no. Remember, you're old enough to run.

1745
02:47:05,459 --> 02:47:30,510
I wouldn't even make it past the I wouldn't even make it past the first like little primary where they weed out the people that are just doing it as a joke like me become president. I wouldn't do it. I would be a terrible president.

1746
02:47:30,510 --> 02:48:08,920
No, the jester does not get the crown. That's not it would be bad. I would like drop the crown thunder. It would be a whole episode of this show where I dropped the crown and it shattered on the ground and I tried to glue it back together and pretend like I never dropped it with with a like a British TV show laugh track. What happened?

1747
02:48:08,920 --> 02:49:22,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

1748
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:24,579
I'm not I'm not a fucking idiot. I'm gonna vote for like this person

1749
02:49:24,579 --> 02:49:26,579
No, this is like there was a joke for like a week

1750
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:34,719
My immediate family would vote for me and actually I'm not even sure that would be the case either

1751
02:49:35,120 --> 02:49:39,959
I'm not sure that would even be the case. I don't even I don't think I'd even vote for myself

1752
02:49:40,719 --> 02:49:42,159
Cuz that's what you do

1753
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:50,120
You vote for yourself all these presidents and all these they're voting for themselves. They're voting for themselves. They're not voting for the other guy

1754
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:56,100
I don't even understand why they even ask or why it's like, oh, who did you vote for?

1755
02:49:57,340 --> 02:49:59,899
The guy trying to beat me in the election

1756
02:49:59,899 --> 02:50:09,479
I mean, you know, it'd be funny to actually just do that just to say that if you're the president like all the president voted today

1757
02:50:09,479 --> 02:50:14,760
With uh, then they went out they came in and let's get a let's get a little interview. Oh, mr. President

1758
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:20,719
Yeah, I did you voted. I sure did. Oh, did you vote for a wink the other guy?

1759
02:50:20,719 --> 02:50:26,170
I voted for the other party other candidate. I like their ideas. I think they got a lot of things going for them

1760
02:50:26,409 --> 02:50:39,219
What happened but they just immediately would you just lose or would you just be like I've right wrote in Mickey Mouse

1761
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:44,360
They're all you vote for yourself all of them

1762
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:53,639
Okay, come out of the booth hold up the paper with the other person's name

1763
02:50:53,920 --> 02:51:01,590
Checkmarked the other candidate and say I'm voting for Dean dingus. I like his ideas and

1764
02:51:02,149 --> 02:51:10,989
By the way, I am resigning the presidency. What would happen would ever what would happen to the news stations?

1765
02:51:11,229 --> 02:51:31,079
All right, I gotta find that signal again. It was right here, right and then later on the next day

1766
02:51:31,079 --> 02:51:34,780
I say I was just kidding like guys that was a joke

1767
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:38,139
That was a fucking joke you think I would what are you talking about?

1768
02:51:38,139 --> 02:52:06,319
And then the other guy goes no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't think so

1769
02:52:07,409 --> 02:52:10,889
He's gonna do that shit. He just got all the cameras on him. Everyone's like talking about it

1770
02:52:10,889 --> 02:52:12,889
He's got he's got like a he's fucking trending. I

1771
02:52:14,040 --> 02:52:15,719
resigned my

1772
02:52:15,719 --> 02:52:22,579
Resign the nomination. Is that how you get like a Mickey Mouse president?

1773
02:52:22,739 --> 02:52:30,319
But then if Mickey Mouse got like 11 like a 5 to 10,000 votes like 11,000 10,000 votes, right?

1774
02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:42,280
Would Mickey Mouse become the president with that? Is that how that would work on election night?

1775
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:47,069
they both say they they're resigning and they have to figure out who the

1776
02:52:48,629 --> 02:52:51,590
1.0 percent like 1.2 percent other votes were

1777
02:52:52,149 --> 02:52:57,350
Like Aquaman has like a hundred votes and he's on that CNN screen of potential fucking presidents

1778
02:52:57,549 --> 02:53:05,379
You got Mickey Mouse Aquaman Benjamin Franklin and Kanye. Oh boy

1779
02:53:05,940 --> 02:53:10,889
That's that's that's like a like a germ of rumble match

1780
02:53:28,440 --> 02:53:34,899
Confirmed for next year. All right. Where is this shit 1 and 12? That's easy. No, it's not it's gonna take forever

1781
02:53:35,620 --> 02:53:53,989
All right, 1 and 22. Oh, let's just start it. I would do I miss my power. Okay, how am I doing on power? Oh

1782
02:53:55,340 --> 02:54:02,620
Fuck, it's just me. How do I make efficiency better? I charge efficiency is 93% power consumption

1783
02:54:03,809 --> 02:54:12,780
How do I get more power? Oh, I do burn off antennas when they aren't moving

1784
02:54:13,299 --> 02:54:15,389
Make the Sun brighter

1785
02:54:15,389 --> 02:54:21,010
Start the generator. Oh shit. Okay

1786
02:54:27,870 --> 02:54:50,690
Next game up runs satellites aren't calibrated. They aren't previously on the next game of runs

1787
02:54:55,409 --> 02:54:58,270
Elevation is doing fine 31. Let's get that to

1788
02:55:00,329 --> 02:55:02,639
It needs to be like

1789
02:55:02,639 --> 02:55:04,000
30

1790
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:19,500
30 it's getting there. It's 300. It's gonna take a long time. Actually. No, it's not shouldn't take that long

1791
02:55:21,729 --> 02:55:27,489
27 is that going up?

1792
02:55:27,649 --> 02:55:29,649
Komodo crew activated

1793
02:55:36,030 --> 02:55:48,440
360 to zero. Yeah, that's not that far. I mean it is but it isn't what is it?

1794
02:55:48,440 --> 02:56:00,569
I'm being spammed and thanks among themselves. Is that Jerma?

1795
02:56:00,829 --> 02:56:09,149
What the fuck is that that we can disagree with one and wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you fucking kidding? Oh

1796
02:56:10,930 --> 02:56:12,930
Jesus fucking Christ

1797
02:56:13,610 --> 02:56:20,600
I'm doing a new kill the meme stream. I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot a bow and arrow right through Jerma susses forehead

1798
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:39,920
He's gotta go Jerma susses gotta go. I should have done it in a rumble. It's a fake image. Oh, you're gonna be on say it

1799
02:56:41,059 --> 02:56:43,260
Streisand effect. I know I don't

1800
02:56:46,260 --> 02:57:16,360
Talk about it. Have you he's going insane. Oh calibrate the antenna. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

1801
02:57:16,700 --> 02:57:27,840
I need to wait till I get this. How do I wait? How do you calibrate the antenna?

1802
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:32,889
River temperature forty five point eight degrees at Celsius

1803
02:57:33,329 --> 02:57:35,700
You're a diagnostics on the server. Oh

1804
02:57:36,180 --> 02:58:02,879
But how do I change your fucking router password, you know, like nobody does what I do diagnostics. Okay, mom

1805
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:07,500
There's no reason to

1806
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:09,500
So why even have a password on it then?

1807
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:14,190
Do you really think that you're like kid or something is gonna get onto the router? What are they gonna do?

1808
02:58:14,649 --> 02:58:17,670
Why is there a password on the router if that's the case?

1809
02:58:18,190 --> 02:58:20,809
What are you preventing somebody from doing?

1810
02:58:20,809 --> 02:58:27,389
You know how much of pain in the ass it is to type in like one nine eight dot one dot zero dot zero what it is

1811
02:58:27,389 --> 02:58:35,409
And hit enter it's because you have no roblox turned on after 9 p.m. So they could go on there and they could take the

1812
02:58:36,409 --> 02:58:51,750
The roblox server off the band list. I mean you can turn the password off

1813
02:58:52,389 --> 02:58:54,760
Can't you also just reset the router?

1814
02:58:54,920 --> 02:59:00,340
With like a pen to that one little spot that you just hold the button down and it just goes to factory

1815
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:11,180
Why even have a password? It sets it to the default password, right? So

1816
02:59:12,040 --> 02:59:19,219
It doesn't go to factory. You sure it returned it return an error antenna server timeout

1817
02:59:19,479 --> 02:59:33,420
So people in your house can't get in the neighbors stealing the Wi-Fi. Well, no, no, that's that's the Wi-Fi

1818
02:59:33,420 --> 02:59:37,100
That's the password to get onto your Wi-Fi not the password of your

1819
02:59:37,420 --> 02:59:38,940
Your router

1820
02:59:38,940 --> 02:59:44,520
You have to be on the network to get on to the router, right?

1821
02:59:44,639 --> 02:59:54,319
Why are we talking about this? Does this really matter who brought this up who brought this up?

1822
02:59:54,319 --> 02:59:57,120
Well, why are we even talking about this is the dumbest conversation. I think we've ever had

1823
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:03,889
It's all right, I'll see you previously on the next game of thrones I

1824
03:00:07,479 --> 03:00:18,280
Did it was always you know, it wasn't always me. All right, so we need to go to

1825
03:00:19,159 --> 03:00:35,190
Almost there to go to antenna 19 and reboot it. I will after we find the alien

1826
03:00:35,610 --> 03:00:48,190
Okay, I'm too. I'm close. I'm too close. How old is that coffee? It probably five or six days old. All right

1827
03:00:48,190 --> 03:00:55,920
All right, hold on. I'm getting ready to hit the stop button so I can hold on 20-point. We're getting close

1828
03:00:56,020 --> 03:01:15,440
I'm ready to hit stop 30.9. Stop 30.9. It's moving around

1829
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:29,040
All right, it's 30.90 30.90. We need this to go to oh, just keep it going

1830
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:36,700
Whatever and I Academy died for this. No Jedi Academy is gonna be played tomorrow

1831
03:01:37,219 --> 03:01:46,079
That's what we're doing tomorrow. Jedi Academy is tomorrow. I just leaked it. Hey, I'm sorry

1832
03:01:46,079 --> 03:02:03,569
I leaked it. All right, I'm gonna already stop this. Are you lying? No, 30.9 is what I need

1833
03:02:03,569 --> 03:02:14,690
All right, let's see that we got if 3 to 15. So we're getting there. Here we go. We're at 3

1834
03:02:14,729 --> 03:02:29,209
I'm gonna have 3090 is the what we need 3090 right there is good boot it up five

1835
03:02:29,809 --> 03:02:37,149
Keep an eye on that Ozzie booth. They're gonna have ray tracing. I don't have the 2080

1836
03:02:37,149 --> 03:02:52,739
I have a 1080 after all these years really five seven to 72. Are you kidding me? This one sucks

1837
03:02:52,780 --> 03:03:08,430
It works just fine. I have not had any problems with 1080. They can't run watchdogs legions

1838
03:03:08,430 --> 03:03:23,870
But why would you want to run that game in the first place? I'm perfectly fine with the 1080 right now. It's sturdy

1839
03:03:23,870 --> 03:03:30,959
It's hardy some would call it the Super Nintendo of the Nvidia GPUs. It was it's the perfect card

1840
03:03:43,559 --> 03:03:53,010
65 is the max. All right. Well 760 is the Super Nintendo

1841
03:03:53,010 --> 03:04:06,030
No, I don't know but I don't think I agree with that. Here's the Christmas deluxe bundle event

1842
03:04:06,030 --> 03:04:11,719
The 1080 will get you at least three more years of high. You need a better CPU for streaming though

1843
03:04:11,719 --> 03:04:15,670
Yeah, I know now once

1844
03:04:15,670 --> 03:04:22,780
GPUs come back and stock really and people don't have to make like discord bots to figure out when they can buy one

1845
03:04:23,569 --> 03:04:35,030
I'll get one. That's my CPU I

1846
03:04:35,989 --> 03:04:43,920
768 50k 6 core stop. Okay, we need where we got 31

1847
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:51,000
We need to go back to 30 30th. Is this gonna be like a mirror here? Okay, we need 30

1848
03:04:51,280 --> 03:04:59,559
Well, like yeah 30 and 39. Let's do that. You missed it 30

1849
03:05:01,370 --> 03:05:20,030
32 what I missed it. What was it 30.5? Oh shit. I mean 9. Hey, what was it then 31? Oh dummy

1850
03:05:20,069 --> 03:05:42,600
Don't change that. Come on. Hurry up. Come on 31. Come on 30.5 and

1851
03:05:44,239 --> 03:05:57,579
We this is moving around too much pretty point. This is looking this moving around. Oh, how do I it's the calibration bullshit now?

1852
03:05:57,579 --> 03:06:22,159
Auto track it is downloading a point four megabytes a second. What is that bullshit? What? Oh my god

1853
03:06:22,159 --> 03:06:43,180
I have to reboot the server. I don't even know what to do next with server. Is there a server tutorial? Where's my mouse?

1854
03:06:51,280 --> 03:06:57,139
Calibration you can check the calibration test for all antennas in the terminal. He's just calibrate. Okay

1855
03:06:58,159 --> 03:07:03,290
Calibration reach this panel. You said it's not so I see her. Okay

1856
03:07:04,270 --> 03:07:13,549
Calibration looking for an Italian cattle. Okay

1857
03:07:14,909 --> 03:07:35,590
So how do I these are all wrong? I have to make these all zero Jesus diagnostics. I'll start

1858
03:07:36,149 --> 03:07:41,719
hell start

1859
03:07:41,719 --> 03:07:43,719
antenna controls and detection disabled

1860
03:07:44,989 --> 03:07:48,920
Fuck I'm still downloading this

1861
03:07:49,520 --> 03:10:35,940
So, um, I gotta pee again. I'll be right back pee time. Hey, happy new year. It's you

1862
03:10:36,020 --> 03:10:47,860
Why is it always a break but never a poop break? Oh, well, it's really easy to

1863
03:10:48,579 --> 03:10:59,200
Explain because I typically don't like need to poop during his stream. I give you a streamer tidbit of knowledge

1864
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:01,559
It's insider information

1865
03:11:01,559 --> 03:11:03,959
let's say

1866
03:11:03,959 --> 03:11:10,540
70% of every single reason why a streamer is late is because they are currently

1867
03:11:10,940 --> 03:11:15,250
Taking a shit and they want to make sure they don't have to shit during the stream

1868
03:11:15,309 --> 03:11:22,030
So that's why I would say at least 75% of the time

1869
03:11:22,110 --> 03:11:34,260
That's what's going on because and here's the worst part when you start to feel it coming on

1870
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:39,559
Let's say I'm gonna start streaming at 3 o'clock Pacific at like

1871
03:11:40,159 --> 03:11:44,950
245 if I start to feel it coming on it's oh

1872
03:11:45,750 --> 03:11:52,239
Okay, I know if I start streaming at 3 that's gonna be ready to I'm gonna have to do something

1873
03:11:52,239 --> 03:11:59,760
I have to take care of that at like 4 like 330 and I don't fucking have to just go take off like 30 minutes

1874
03:11:59,760 --> 03:12:04,200
So you just delay you say hey, I'm having some technical difficulties

1875
03:12:04,920 --> 03:12:07,719
What one of my wires is plugged in weird my USB stick?

1876
03:12:07,719 --> 03:12:10,360
I just I can't get it right to fit the right way. You can never get it the first try

1877
03:12:10,559 --> 03:12:14,159
See you in 45 minutes and you wait till it's ready you take care of it

1878
03:12:14,159 --> 03:12:22,280
So then you can stream for like four or five six hours without having to worry about it that image by the way

1879
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:29,219
That you're looking at right now was on Travis touchdowns t-shirt and that's in full HD

1880
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:34,000
That was the one that was it right there

1881
03:12:34,719 --> 03:12:37,780
You got to see it up close

1882
03:12:37,780 --> 03:12:44,670
Casino ain't got robbed a lot of people think that

1883
03:12:51,120 --> 03:13:01,750
Alright, let's go. It's a good dick-dash of Lee Richard. What was I doing? Wait, it's calibrating the antenna

1884
03:13:01,930 --> 03:13:09,819
Do I have to do this? Is it doing it on its own? Oh shit. It's doing it on its own

1885
03:13:09,819 --> 03:13:27,920
It's doing it still downloading on seven point eight percent said you would stream Doki Doki Literature Club

1886
03:13:27,920 --> 03:13:43,909
I already know like you can't if I play Doki Doki Literature Club

1887
03:13:44,110 --> 03:13:53,139
I first of all, I don't play those games. Anyways, I don't play those that kind of game. So there's strike one strike two is

1888
03:13:53,739 --> 03:13:58,739
So many of you guys told me to watch the movie and hey watch this movie, dude

1889
03:13:58,739 --> 03:14:04,280
You're gonna love it, especially after the first hour. Mm-hmm. Oh wait. Hey, hey this movie

1890
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:08,319
It's such a good movie. Just wait till you watch it for an hour and then let me know what you think

1891
03:14:08,840 --> 03:14:14,360
Okay, cool. So I know something fucking happens in like an hour. It's gonna be like a big twist or something. Great

1892
03:14:14,399 --> 03:14:23,649
Thanks for telling me now at like 59 minutes when one hour crosses. I now know here it comes

1893
03:14:23,950 --> 03:14:33,590
Listen calibrate or what? Oh, it's doing all of them doesn't matter do it

1894
03:14:33,590 --> 03:14:40,739
Anyways, but you want to pretend to be excited and pretend to be shocked when the thing that everybody wrote Pepe laugh

1895
03:14:40,739 --> 03:14:47,079
He doesn't know you know how many times I've seen Pepe laugh. He doesn't know he doesn't know about Doki Doki Literature Club

1896
03:14:47,079 --> 03:15:04,200
But you want to pretend to be shocked when I see the thing that happens calibration takes a while. Okay getting more power

1897
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:13,149
By the way, that's good. This is still downloading and this sound needs to turn down not the right one

1898
03:15:13,149 --> 03:15:25,950
I don't know which one of these is making that sound what I need. What is making that sound?

1899
03:15:26,229 --> 03:15:38,319
Okay, it was the stupid-ass TV. My room is covered in posters with one of the Doki Doki characters

1900
03:15:38,319 --> 03:15:48,309
What does this um, how do you want me to say about that?

1901
03:15:52,069 --> 03:15:58,120
Alright rare TV spam

1902
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:08,600
That's right rare TV spam and remember when I was gonna remove bald coin

1903
03:16:08,600 --> 03:16:16,620
I held I held on to removing bald coin long enough for it to be relevant again

1904
03:16:16,620 --> 03:16:29,600
I should have held the real thing long enough, right? But no, I kept the emote

1905
03:16:29,600 --> 03:16:35,649
I held the emote but not the asset. What a fucking dope

1906
03:16:35,850 --> 03:16:51,739
He sold omega well, not all of it. Not all of it. I have enough to open up an account. Look at it and go

1907
03:16:53,700 --> 03:16:59,450
And then close it because of I got out like two years ago

1908
03:16:59,489 --> 03:17:10,760
I have enough I have just enough and I had more previously for me to be in the shower

1909
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:16,579
randomly like once every like two or three months now to just go like

1910
03:17:17,139 --> 03:17:21,260
Get the shampoo in there. There it is. It feels pretty good

1911
03:17:22,950 --> 03:17:25,409
Fucking should have held I had I should have held them

1912
03:17:31,409 --> 03:17:41,430
Feels good should turn the water off, you know, you have aetherium. No, why is it quiet?

1913
03:17:41,790 --> 03:17:50,940
I turned all the volume down on everything. I kind of miss the the like frog sounds. Don't you?

1914
03:17:51,079 --> 03:18:12,469
Yeah, I miss the summertime frog sounds. This is an alternate universe. What shampoo do you use? I use the lush

1915
03:18:12,870 --> 03:18:15,750
Everybody asked that all the time. What?

1916
03:18:23,219 --> 03:18:38,079
Calibrate this already. I lost all my data. Please be joking. Why is it a joke? I use lush I use big and vegan East

1917
03:18:38,079 --> 03:18:49,739
I'm not vegan. I just happen to like this the conditioner. It makes my hair feel nice omega. Lul. He's vegan omega

1918
03:18:49,739 --> 03:19:06,180
Yeah, here you go. Fine. Is it weird that I feel like if the word vegan just it's not even it's just activates

1919
03:19:06,180 --> 03:19:11,850
A bunch of bots that write the word omega lul vegan. Like I don't think people are writing that

1920
03:19:11,850 --> 03:19:15,729
I think they have that you put you have like a notepad that has a bunch of like random insults on it that are

1921
03:19:15,729 --> 03:19:30,370
Copy and pasted like a bot that's set up that just says omega lul vegan every time the word vegan is heard because it's immediate

1922
03:19:30,530 --> 03:19:50,139
Holy shit antenna number four is fucked. We have to we have to get a new one go to sleep now

1923
03:19:50,139 --> 03:20:02,510
Oh, yeah, it's not a bad idea. He said the he said the vegan word check bathroom. I love baths though

1924
03:20:02,510 --> 03:20:19,170
I'll tell you I'm a big fan of baths drinks heal and uses vegan shampoo. This streamer is fucked to you

1925
03:20:19,170 --> 03:20:28,450
I like you. Yeah, I will die on that hill you could all right fine

1926
03:20:28,450 --> 03:20:33,629
You can fight me on the lush thing if you want really you'll lose like I mean you're gonna lose cuz I mean

1927
03:20:33,629 --> 03:20:37,940
It's just I like the products. Yeah, you're not gonna win the heal argument with me

1928
03:20:37,979 --> 03:20:53,360
He wears a healing bracelet. No, I had I told didn't in that video. I even said I don't believe in this

1929
03:20:53,360 --> 03:21:11,040
It just looked cool. I'm not wearing a healing bracelet right now. And if I was whatever, you know, it doesn't matter

1930
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:17,879
It's my life. If I want to wear a vegan healing bracelet, I'm going to it's my life

1931
03:21:17,879 --> 03:21:44,510
So you don't have to worry about it. Did I sleep? What's your skincare routine? I use a micro exfoliant

1932
03:21:44,590 --> 03:21:55,280
Let me say that again, I use a micro exfoliant every three days and then I use a gel cleanser each night

1933
03:21:55,280 --> 03:22:05,520
This is I do I use an eye serum

1934
03:22:06,200 --> 03:22:09,360
all real

1935
03:22:09,360 --> 03:22:13,840
Every maybe three or four nights. I use this eye serum underneath my eyes at night

1936
03:22:13,959 --> 03:22:17,290
You tap it in because I'm starting to get a little crow's feet and stuff

1937
03:22:17,290 --> 03:22:26,889
It's not that's not vegan and I try to drink at least at least six to eight glasses of water a day

1938
03:22:26,889 --> 03:23:01,350
Is water vegan think about it don't like I'm like squirrels and stuff like die in the water and everything

1939
03:23:01,350 --> 03:23:16,709
I don't like fish like die and stuff in the water that you it gets like processed, right? But is water vegan?

1940
03:23:17,069 --> 03:23:27,889
Why is it at zero? It's fucking nighttime. No, they filter out the squirrels

1941
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:40,600
Somebody said there's a literally a fossil fuel tier level argument. I don't know what that means, but it made me laugh

1942
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:44,709
It's built

1943
03:23:45,670 --> 03:24:01,799
What is what I'm trying to piece together what that means a fossil fuel tier level argument

1944
03:24:03,170 --> 03:24:07,750
Fossil heal also fuels equal animals. It's not vegan

1945
03:24:08,129 --> 03:24:29,459
But you don't drink fossil fuels. You don't drink gasoline. Okay, not enough data

1946
03:24:30,020 --> 03:24:35,430
Let's recalibrate. I still have a signal right going not have a signal anymore. Oh

1947
03:24:36,360 --> 03:24:37,559
Oh

1948
03:24:37,559 --> 03:24:39,719
Set oh

1949
03:24:39,719 --> 03:25:03,649
Set you're a bunch of liars. Yeah, they are this is what they do. Look I've had plenty

1950
03:25:03,649 --> 03:25:09,379
I I've had vegan food. That was good. I've had vegetarian food. That was good. I've had meat

1951
03:25:09,379 --> 03:25:21,709
That was delicious. Come on, but you can't enjoy something that just is just plant-based or whatever. Why why not?

1952
03:25:21,709 --> 03:25:28,770
I don't have to like pray to like a vegan God

1953
03:25:30,290 --> 03:25:41,840
Like enjoy a vegan based meal. I don't have to have like a shrine to a head of lettuce or something

1954
03:25:43,280 --> 03:25:51,729
It'd be like a vegetarian. You know, I just it sometimes it's nice. It's so this is like good

1955
03:25:51,729 --> 03:25:54,290
I know it's not gonna be I'm gonna feel like light. It's gonna be not gonna be heavy

1956
03:25:54,729 --> 03:26:13,280
Come on, your skin is gonna turn green

1957
03:26:13,840 --> 03:26:20,489
Breaking news people don't need to go to extremes

1958
03:26:21,129 --> 03:26:29,790
Like I've had beyond burgers before with like vegan cheese on it. I was like, this is good

1959
03:26:29,870 --> 03:26:34,670
This this this taste this is guy. This is I don't hate this. This is dad. This is good. This is fine

1960
03:26:35,309 --> 03:26:52,920
Sometimes you just want like a butternut squash soup and a little piece of toast

1961
03:26:53,399 --> 03:26:55,399
That's something wrong with that

1962
03:26:55,399 --> 03:26:59,899
No, I don't want to drop a meat patty in there today. Not today. It's okay. That's fine

1963
03:27:00,340 --> 03:27:16,690
Yeah, you guys are taking the the BK stacker commercial way too literally and I knew when they aired that that was a bad idea

1964
03:27:17,530 --> 03:27:21,079
At the second it aired I was like this is a bad idea what they're doing here

1965
03:27:21,879 --> 03:27:27,899
Welcome to the stackers Union, buddy meat and cheese no veggies and that was that was cool

1966
03:27:27,899 --> 03:27:28,739
It was like, okay

1967
03:27:28,739 --> 03:27:40,739
This is probably not a good idea that they're doing this they like they they're working like leaned into

1968
03:27:41,299 --> 03:27:49,030
Don't put vegetables on your burgers because they're gross meat and cheese only. It's like, okay, it's not a good idea

1969
03:27:52,829 --> 03:28:00,290
184 14 god damn it. Well, I calibrated right and take all day

1970
03:28:01,049 --> 03:28:09,629
200 fuck go

1971
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:22,850
His vegetables would be extra expensive if I wanted lettuce and tomatoes, I'd order a fucking salad, but I want a salad

1972
03:28:22,850 --> 03:28:24,129
I want a burger

1973
03:28:24,129 --> 03:28:33,770
well, I agree with you with the tomato part, but there's other vegetables that are not tomatoes and

1974
03:28:37,329 --> 03:28:44,350
Sometimes you want that sometimes I just want like a one steak sauce, but excuse me back up

1975
03:28:46,360 --> 03:28:51,950
meat cheese grilled onions grilled mushrooms a one steak sauce

1976
03:28:52,729 --> 03:28:53,370
Excuse me

1977
03:28:53,370 --> 03:29:02,870
I find that to be very very good now if somebody wants to be mad at me for that

1978
03:29:02,989 --> 03:29:09,329
You've not eaten yet and you will just be swearing into your hands with a full burger with everything

1979
03:29:09,329 --> 03:29:14,930
I just told you to put on it and you'd be like fucking idiot stupid fucking dumb. I fucking hate that guy

1980
03:29:15,010 --> 03:29:18,770
So stupid he's just dumb you couldn't get the signal right in the fucking game single system

1981
03:29:18,770 --> 03:29:23,209
I did the game's fucking easy. He did took up two hours. This is all this sandwich stinks. It smells

1982
03:29:23,209 --> 03:29:25,389
I hate this guy sucks. I have

1983
03:29:25,549 --> 03:29:31,090
Hate this fucking guys. It this is really good. This is really good. See he fucking couldn't figure it's a signal

1984
03:29:31,090 --> 03:29:55,209
So I mean, this is working good. I don't have no power. I have to reboot the whole base

1985
03:29:55,209 --> 03:30:09,579
You know, I've reboot the entire base. Is that how this works? Okay set password

1986
03:30:10,219 --> 03:30:42,239
Okay, new password set new password set pass what no set pass set pass it doesn't even work

1987
03:30:42,520 --> 03:31:01,600
What's the security hole here? How do you not feel heavier after vegan meals? Half of them are entirely carbs

1988
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:13,280
I thought I just all I said was I what do you mean?

1989
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:17,309
lettuce tomato

1990
03:31:17,350 --> 03:31:28,209
Mushrooms look, okay. I know I keep saying lettuce tomato mushrooms and onions, but that's not vegan meals

1991
03:31:28,250 --> 03:31:36,739
That's just that's like the condiment level of vegan food, right like lettuce tomato onions mushrooms

1992
03:31:36,899 --> 03:31:54,149
That's not a vegan meal. That's vegan condiment. That's just that's if you add this stuff. I love grilled onions though

1993
03:31:54,309 --> 03:31:56,930
Hey, guess what? That's a vegetable

1994
03:31:59,120 --> 03:32:17,379
No, it's not as meat the whole base is off. I need to go to bed turn the generator back on. All right, there we go

1995
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:29,100
Seafood onions, I don't know what you mean by seafood onions, but I love seafood and I love onions

1996
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:37,530
But I don't know if I I'm not sure we put them together. You know, I'm a big fan of crab cakes. Anybody else crab cakes

1997
03:32:38,920 --> 03:32:46,379
I like California rolls, but not with the fake crab. I like it with

1998
03:32:47,340 --> 03:32:49,340
like actual crap

1999
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:57,920
What and I didn't just tell you that that's the only roll I ever eat. I like spicy tuna

2000
03:32:57,920 --> 03:33:01,360
I like salmon rolls raw so

2001
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:05,540
Relax, I didn't just say

2002
03:33:06,059 --> 03:33:11,440
California roll is the only sushi I've ever eaten and I will fight you if you disagree with me

2003
03:33:11,440 --> 03:33:24,090
I did not say that. I just said I like them. We get a new download speed here. Come on

2004
03:33:24,610 --> 03:33:43,069
Charge this shit. I'll phone your rules of boring. So fake California roll. What do you think about Korean barbecue? I love it

2005
03:33:43,069 --> 03:33:54,620
It's awesome. The generator. Yeah, I just turned it on. It's boring but good. Yeah, you know what else is boring a cheeseburger

2006
03:33:54,739 --> 03:33:57,280
It's meat cheese and bread

2007
03:33:57,760 --> 03:34:10,190
That but they're delicious what a pounder for the win

2008
03:34:10,190 --> 03:34:17,180
I agree what a pounder better than whopper or the whopper bigger than quarter pounder

2009
03:34:17,180 --> 03:34:27,489
So like the rock outside, I feel like I haven't I've not done anything in the game in probably 25 straight minutes

2010
03:34:27,489 --> 03:34:31,559
We've just been talking, you know, sometimes it's that's what you do. We're just hanging out

2011
03:34:31,639 --> 03:35:10,129
We're gonna see the alien before the stream turns off. I've probably not like the rock 500 million dollars in research

2012
03:35:12,329 --> 03:35:14,329
Like ten years of

2013
03:35:15,489 --> 03:35:18,270
developing this place

2014
03:35:18,309 --> 03:35:20,129
Telescopes

2015
03:35:20,129 --> 03:35:22,440
equipment radars

2016
03:35:22,520 --> 03:35:30,149
Light speed we can see into the distance and I picked a shoe up on the ground and that's how I found them

2017
03:35:30,149 --> 03:35:37,280
I just came and picked up a shoe and found the alien

2018
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:53,370
I don't have a kid and here we have right now. I'm sitting here

2019
03:35:54,209 --> 03:35:56,690
Surrounded look around in a circle

2020
03:35:57,680 --> 03:35:59,680
cameras audio equipment

2021
03:36:01,180 --> 03:36:03,670
detectors

2022
03:36:03,670 --> 03:36:08,409
Circling me but I don't have any way to capture what I just looked at

2023
03:36:11,170 --> 03:36:15,889
That in the middle of the research facility. No way and nothing captured that

2024
03:36:16,450 --> 03:36:24,010
Just my eyes and now I have how disappointed is this walk back

2025
03:36:24,370 --> 03:36:33,079
This must be the worst thing that this has ever fucking happened. Just like oh no

2026
03:36:34,159 --> 03:36:36,159
Look at all this stuff

2027
03:36:36,360 --> 03:36:43,370
But it was my entire life was dedicated and nobody's gonna believe me. Oh

2028
03:36:45,979 --> 03:36:48,059
Well, I guess we're gonna try to listen to

2029
03:36:48,540 --> 03:36:57,250
Like deep-sea noises 10 million years away for another 20 years. No one's gonna believe me

2030
03:37:03,690 --> 03:37:07,180
Sit on the bench

2031
03:37:07,180 --> 03:37:12,049
And I at least get like a disposable camera from Walmart

2032
03:37:12,370 --> 03:37:25,600
Wait, maybe okay. We have all this expensive equipment, but what if it was just something very simple, you know

2033
03:37:25,600 --> 03:37:55,709
We're trying too hard good link. All right fine

2034
03:37:56,309 --> 03:38:02,530
We'd judge of that. This isn't the right link. I mean that was all right

2035
03:38:15,120 --> 03:38:17,870
Okay, do we have power?

2036
03:38:18,430 --> 03:38:21,079
we do

2037
03:38:21,079 --> 03:38:24,750
at point two nine percent efficiency I

2038
03:38:25,149 --> 03:38:29,370
Stopped downloading

2039
03:38:29,409 --> 03:38:33,889
actual link

2040
03:38:39,200 --> 03:38:49,569
Okay, not that one

2041
03:38:51,229 --> 03:39:15,200
Wait a minute. What do you got here? You got McDonald's in the basket down there?

2042
03:39:15,200 --> 03:39:22,040
I like it a nice berry heal. All right, cool a healing bracelet and

2043
03:39:23,370 --> 03:39:28,959
A lush shampoo this looks pretty good to me. I don't have a problem with any of these things

2044
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:51,200
This seems like a really good like Friday night to me shoes in the tub. No purple alien

2045
03:39:52,559 --> 03:39:58,000
Purple alien has become an influencer

2046
03:39:58,000 --> 03:40:06,659
I think I just have to turn everything off and just let the word let the facility charge for like an hour

2047
03:40:07,219 --> 03:40:26,479
And why is it that I cannot use the facility while it's plugged in if it's dead?

2048
03:40:26,520 --> 03:40:30,559
I

2049
03:40:30,559 --> 03:40:38,870
Can't stand that when I'm sitting there with if you have a dead phone and you plug it in

2050
03:40:39,770 --> 03:40:43,809
Sometimes you have to wait like 10 straight minutes for the thing to turn on because it runs on battery

2051
03:40:43,969 --> 03:40:47,409
It doesn't you can't there's no such thing as a running on AC with a phone

2052
03:40:47,450 --> 03:41:00,569
Like why can't I run my phone off the wall that pisses me off all the time is what you're doing

2053
03:41:00,569 --> 03:41:04,809
Is you're not running off the wall. You're charging the battery and running off the battery

2054
03:41:04,969 --> 03:41:07,930
You're not running off the wall and I don't know if they're concerned that

2055
03:41:07,969 --> 03:41:15,899
That although if you unplug it you would but you're running on the battery does who cares circuits can't run off AC

2056
03:41:15,899 --> 03:41:29,270
The Android can do it. Can it phones don't run on AC. Yeah, but I mean it annoys me

2057
03:41:29,270 --> 03:41:34,850
I will say I'll be in the middle of doing something my phone will die and it's like, oh fuck

2058
03:41:34,850 --> 03:41:38,629
I'll just plug it in and I'm just sitting there with my hands on my face

2059
03:41:39,450 --> 03:41:47,459
Staring at this thing like five to ten straight minutes like check it. No, I can't turn it on check turn the fuck on

2060
03:41:47,459 --> 03:41:53,350
I'll leave I'll have to go do so but I come back. It's still not on hold the button down

2061
03:41:53,469 --> 03:41:58,000
Finally. Oh, there it is. There's the Apple symbol and it's at like 12% charge

2062
03:41:58,000 --> 03:42:02,379
Well, why didn't you turn on when you were at like five? What's that bullshit?

2063
03:42:02,379 --> 03:42:20,520
It's very very annoying Android phones can turn out at 1% then I have to relearn an operating system

2064
03:42:20,520 --> 03:42:31,760
I don't want to do that. I already know everything is on iPhone. I don't know what to do

2065
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:33,280
I don't know where I already know where thing is

2066
03:42:33,280 --> 03:42:37,440
I don't want to like to have to get I've been using Apple

2067
03:42:38,190 --> 03:42:43,280
Mobile devices since I was like fucking I don't know like 20 25 or something

2068
03:42:43,399 --> 03:42:50,440
I use Apple for all my mobile devices

2069
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:58,040
But have I refused to use Apple for a desktop and I'm getting to the point where I might start

2070
03:42:58,040 --> 03:43:15,059
I think I might switch Android thinking about it. They really pissed me off with that iPhone 12 mini bullshit

2071
03:43:15,059 --> 03:43:22,040
I'm serious that made me irrationally upset those who that don't understand what I'm talking about

2072
03:43:22,040 --> 03:43:25,360
There's a lot of people that might not have been here like six months ago when I talked about this

2073
03:43:25,440 --> 03:43:34,860
The iPhone SE comes out and it's a little phone. It's the iPhone 4 case. It's a little guy. It's just a compact phone

2074
03:43:34,860 --> 03:43:40,000
That's what I want. That's what I wanted. I don't I hate this big-ass phone bullshit

2075
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:41,760
I hate the huge bricks in your pocket

2076
03:43:41,760 --> 03:43:47,360
What do you I need to carry around like a fanny pack or like a backpack to carry around an iPhone now or an Android?

2077
03:43:47,399 --> 03:43:54,180
All of them. They're huge. It's stupid. I don't like how big they are. It's annoying to me. So they are teasing

2078
03:43:54,440 --> 03:44:00,579
They're teasing there might be an iPhone SE 2. Oh my god

2079
03:44:00,579 --> 03:44:04,819
I can't buy iPhone SE 2 you kidding me iPhone SE 2

2080
03:44:05,180 --> 03:44:12,459
It's gonna be small right cuz that everybody loved it people have been begging them to make that right the iPhone SE 2 is

2081
03:44:12,659 --> 03:44:18,969
Not small. It's just a standard iPhone size and it looked like they were never going to make a small one again

2082
03:44:18,969 --> 03:44:23,030
You think that the SE SE 2 would be the same thing you made a little phone

2083
03:44:23,030 --> 03:44:28,729
It was the SE the SE 2 is not a little phone and they there's no they don't tell anybody anything

2084
03:44:28,729 --> 03:44:31,969
Oh, well, no, just wait. We're making a small one. Nope

2085
03:44:31,969 --> 03:44:34,909
They just fucking announced one day randomly that like iPhone 12

2086
03:44:35,209 --> 03:44:40,750
Mini is now a thing after everybody that was an SE fan bought the SE 2 thinking

2087
03:44:40,750 --> 03:44:45,049
This is the smallest phone we were gonna get these these you know

2088
03:44:45,049 --> 03:44:55,459
These I they came up with iPhone 12 mini like six months later, and it's the exact thing that I wanted

2089
03:44:55,459 --> 03:45:05,629
So now I have to go buy a new iPhone go trade in the SE that's horse shit. That's absolute dog shit

2090
03:45:05,629 --> 03:45:10,159
They just want to put a 12 on it. They wanted to put a 12 on it

2091
03:45:10,200 --> 03:45:14,139
So people go one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. I got that one. I want twelve

2092
03:45:16,180 --> 03:45:18,180

03:45:21,659 --> 03:45:29,219
Twelve means better twelve small. Oh

03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:41,079
All right, I'm just gonna I'm gonna hang up my line so I'm gonna unplug my line

2107
03:46:41,079 --> 03:46:52,309
I always tell it 3.3 percent. This is fucking bullshit. Happy hour at Chuck E. Cheese

2108
03:46:53,350 --> 03:47:05,540
What happy hour at Chuck E. Cheese would be they put two or three extra ski balls in the ski ball machine

2109
03:47:05,620 --> 03:47:20,489
That's what that would be. Can I download this yet? All right, it's at 16%

2110
03:47:21,290 --> 03:47:35,579
All right. All right all power to download. I lost the signal

2111
03:47:36,139 --> 03:47:38,319
No turn power off. I need to recharge

2112
03:47:38,600 --> 03:47:53,079
I'm a small hands. I just like a small phone. They're just too big. I just I don't you guys I use my phone to

2113
03:47:53,659 --> 03:47:56,159
make phone calls and

2114
03:47:56,479 --> 03:48:00,719
Check like Twitter. I don't I don't need a big movie screen

2115
03:48:00,719 --> 03:48:07,200
I don't need three super high pixel like HD cameras

2116
03:48:07,200 --> 03:48:23,500
I don't care. I just want to telephone they actually played the game or yet or you just yeah

2117
03:48:23,500 --> 03:48:25,540
I have we found like three or four different signals

2118
03:48:25,620 --> 03:48:38,559
But I just I'm waiting for the house to recharge at a landline then no

2119
03:48:38,559 --> 03:48:43,840
I'm not gonna get a landline turn on the generator. Yeah, I'll turn it on

2120
03:48:44,440 --> 03:48:50,629
No, no landlines. You can't carry a landline around

2121
03:48:50,750 --> 03:49:00,430
The whole point of having a little cell phone is to have a little phone that people can like contact you in your pocket

2122
03:49:00,629 --> 03:49:09,200
what used to be a thing that was it had an ability to be contactable when you left your house has turned into a

2123
03:49:09,760 --> 03:49:13,850
movie screen a

2124
03:49:14,770 --> 03:49:31,229
Movie camera, so they're too big. When are you gonna be satisfied?

2125
03:49:31,790 --> 03:49:37,360
How many iPhones do they have to go through before before the wheel? That's it

2126
03:49:37,360 --> 03:49:46,159
Like that's all we're gonna do how many G's do we have to add we're gonna go to like 10g

2127
03:49:46,159 --> 03:49:56,989
I don't even use 4g you do no

2128
03:49:56,989 --> 03:50:02,260
I but like do you though one of how fast do you need to load your Twitter feed?

2129
03:50:12,770 --> 03:50:19,040
3g Andy you're coming actual boomer moment

2130
03:50:19,719 --> 03:50:25,319
Yeah, but like what at what point is it do we need faster internet for our phones?

2131
03:50:36,280 --> 03:50:45,200
Streaming we need it now. How many do we need? I don't know

2132
03:50:45,200 --> 03:50:47,799
I can call somebody and talk to them just fine

2133
03:50:47,799 --> 03:50:53,920
I can like tweet out a photo of me giving like the thumbs up at my favorite restaurant

2134
03:50:53,920 --> 03:51:13,379
And that just goes up like in one second, but the quality sucks

2135
03:51:15,280 --> 03:51:28,280
You're using like 5 gigahertz internet in your phone right now now in your home right now

2136
03:51:28,840 --> 03:51:36,020
But I'm not what I'm not walking around with my desktop and my monitor like attached to my back and in front of me

2137
03:51:36,239 --> 03:51:57,190
I'm not downloading like GTA 5 on my iPhone point is it's getting too fast

2138
03:51:57,190 --> 03:52:04,760
And when eventually it's gonna get too fast with they're gonna start thinking they're gonna start making problems

2139
03:52:04,760 --> 03:52:07,159
They're gonna realize that like our spleens don't need to exist

2140
03:52:09,950 --> 03:52:11,950
iPhone iPhone like

2141
03:52:12,149 --> 03:52:14,149
50 with like

2142
03:52:14,350 --> 03:52:20,389
25g is it gonna be able to understand I can I can make that spleen better. They don't need that spleen

2143
03:52:20,389 --> 03:52:23,420
What's it in there for I'm so fucking fast

2144
03:52:23,979 --> 03:52:46,569
Okay, all right. All right. All right. I'm done. I was gonna keep going, but I don't I don't want to keep going

2145
03:52:46,569 --> 03:52:48,569
I need to stop that now

2146
03:52:50,270 --> 03:52:55,770
You know

2147
03:52:55,770 --> 03:53:00,959
That was an Ellen tweet

2148
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:14,170
Yeah, it was it was it was like how are we gonna get we're gonna get to

2149
03:53:14,690 --> 03:53:20,409
iPhone like 55 and I don't know how long it's gonna take before we get the iPhone 60

2150
03:53:20,969 --> 03:53:23,280
It was something like that, wasn't it?

2151
03:53:34,559 --> 03:53:40,280
Okay, I have to stop but this is just the shit. I'm wait. I'm trying to get to fucking 7% phone battery

2152
03:53:40,280 --> 03:53:42,479
Okay, this is the shit that we have to do. I have to fill time

2153
03:53:54,760 --> 03:53:56,760
Joker Ellen, what are you talking about?

2154
03:53:57,239 --> 03:54:00,559
Ellen the Joker are the same person

2155
03:54:01,159 --> 03:54:06,090
Start turning things off. You aren't using

2156
03:54:06,610 --> 03:54:11,979
What what do you mean turn things off that I'm not what that's how this works

2157
03:54:22,120 --> 03:54:24,040
Oh my god

2158
03:54:24,040 --> 03:54:43,479
Turn the lights off. Turn the lights off. Turn everything off in the turn all the lights off

2159
03:54:43,959 --> 03:54:45,959
Turn the stove off turn that's on

2160
03:54:46,000 --> 03:54:52,459
Turn all the lights off. I need to conserve energy so I can turn my iPhone on

2161
03:54:58,520 --> 03:55:00,079
Unplug everything

2162
03:55:00,079 --> 03:55:09,950
Fucking iPhones. I swear to God there are these lights up wherever they go. How are we doing?

2163
03:55:10,389 --> 03:55:42,579
Okay, I'm set 8% battery turn the generator off. Yep, turn off the monitors. What I can't turn the computer off

2164
03:55:42,579 --> 03:55:48,370
I can't turn off the solar panels. I have one thing at a time

2165
03:55:49,049 --> 03:55:59,639
Turn everything off

2166
03:55:59,639 --> 03:56:09,180
Turn off the stream

2167
03:56:09,459 --> 03:56:25,420
Where's the generator however, I would I go I can't drive this car turn it off turn it up

2168
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:41,450
I'm turning off the generator right now. I can't it's off. No, it's not what turn it off turn fucking generator off

2169
03:56:41,969 --> 03:57:31,129
Alright, that's it. Where's the door? Please use iPhones. They're infinitely more secure and private. Alright, everything's off. Nice

2170
03:57:32,049 --> 03:57:38,469
10% battery literally every computer can guy can hack an iPhone

2171
03:57:38,469 --> 03:57:55,229
I don't I don't know any of it shit about that. It rings and I answer it enough a light in this room

2172
03:57:55,430 --> 03:58:19,479
Is there one in this room the Ellen show? Hold on the Ellen show she says

2173
03:58:20,260 --> 03:58:29,670
200 years in the future honey. Have you seen my iPhone 378? I needed to pre-order my ps6 my ps6

2174
03:58:29,870 --> 03:58:37,479
Why would it be iPhone 307? Why would that what is that implying that only one more playstations coming out in 200 years?

2175
03:58:38,040 --> 03:59:00,280
That's the joke fucking hilarious

2176
03:59:01,040 --> 03:59:06,809
New deal. No, we're gonna already

2177
03:59:07,450 --> 03:59:18,479
Do a cooking stream for 1 billion off the debt. Yeah, I think about it. It's all gonna be cloud-based

2178
03:59:19,159 --> 03:59:22,799
That's the theory right?

2179
03:59:22,799 --> 03:59:38,180
Well, that's the theory about the stadia is that Google knows it's terrible and knows it's an awful fucking system

2180
03:59:38,579 --> 03:59:54,549
But they're playing like the 10 to 20 year long game. So we'll see turn off the antennas

2181
03:59:55,030 --> 04:00:28,459
You can already thread cloud infrastructure. I don't know what that means, but it sounds important turn everything up. It's going faster actually

2182
04:00:29,059 --> 04:00:47,200
Yeah, cool. New deal. New deal. New deal

2183
04:00:47,879 --> 04:00:50,670
Keeping the battery at zero. Hold on. Let me see what this person's saying

2184
04:00:51,250 --> 04:00:55,409
Keeping the battery at zero is bad. So your phone charges a little bit

2185
04:00:55,409 --> 04:01:10,809
They can they can endure on of AC and bypass the battery. I've never seen it before careful now

2186
04:01:10,809 --> 04:01:19,610
Don't put the cat puke into the soup. What's the next big leap in technology?

2187
04:01:19,610 --> 04:01:25,930
Do you guys think it's self-driving cars or do you think it's quantum computing or do you think it's something else that we don't know?

2188
04:01:26,270 --> 04:01:28,270
What do you guys think AI?

2189
04:01:31,590 --> 04:01:44,920
Batteries. Hmm. VR sex. Hmm. Okay, the perfect Poggy mode

2190
04:01:47,200 --> 04:02:07,879
AI it's probably it's gonna be either well, it doesn't AI include self-driving cars in a way. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know

2191
04:02:07,879 --> 04:02:14,430
I don't know what it's gonna be. It might be something just that comes out of nowhere

2192
04:02:21,420 --> 04:02:26,059
Battery an upgrade in battery technology would be good because right lithium is not good, right?

2193
04:02:26,340 --> 04:02:31,549
then the whole thing about lithium batteries is what we run everything on lithium and

2194
04:02:32,350 --> 04:02:49,559
That's not a good thing. How do we make better batteries? Hmm. Interesting. There are batteries. I think reusable paper plates

2195
04:02:50,200 --> 04:02:57,489
Hmm. There are batteries. I think play the video game. I am

2196
04:03:13,620 --> 04:03:15,620
For the people that are just like

2197
04:03:15,739 --> 04:03:18,459
What it why is he sitting with the lights off I'm playing the game

2198
04:03:19,020 --> 04:03:29,309
Solid-state batteries. What was this game about? It was about finding aliens, but we found the alien the alien flew overhead

2199
04:03:29,829 --> 04:03:40,649
Spoiler. I saw the alien at least his vehicle. It's gonna right here. All right, we can boot it up

2200
04:03:56,399 --> 04:04:02,879
Scanner go in the chat Joel in the chat. What's up, Joel?

2201
04:04:04,329 --> 04:04:09,299
How far did you get in this game? Did you beat it? Did you find the alien?

2202
04:04:09,299 --> 04:04:20,450
I couldn't I found the alien spaceship, but I didn't find anything else you found the alien. Oh shit

2203
04:04:20,750 --> 04:04:33,290
What are you doing this game? Well, you're about to see right now. You have to scan for planets. You have to find sounds

2204
04:04:33,930 --> 04:04:35,930
analyze frequencies

2205
04:04:36,049 --> 04:04:45,020
upload the frequencies to the governmental database decipher where the alien is and then cause an immediate conflict and

2206
04:04:45,420 --> 04:04:55,680
Start an interplanetary war as fast as possible and my record so far is about is 11 minutes. So

2207
04:04:56,239 --> 04:05:05,979
Okay, we need here. We are

2208
04:05:08,379 --> 04:05:11,739
300 is the minimum and then we got 20 324. Oh

2209
04:05:14,010 --> 04:05:19,389
It really is she knows I'm sorry

2210
04:05:19,950 --> 04:05:41,040
Let's go drop that power poke noise. We still go. I'm sorry. I just I just scratched you in the eye

2211
04:05:41,920 --> 04:05:46,920
We're still going up in power, right? I'm still we're still good. This is not gonna start draining. Is it?

2212
04:05:50,120 --> 04:06:04,360
Perfectly balanced at fifteen point six. Okay, we're good lock the doors

2213
04:06:04,360 --> 04:06:15,750
Oh cares the only person here a helicopter comes every day and drops off like red

2214
04:06:16,229 --> 04:06:31,129
Spam and eggs or something. I don't know aliens are gonna get in well

2215
04:06:31,129 --> 04:06:37,809
They're doing a really bad job of it so far. Those doors have been open for four hours

2216
04:06:38,129 --> 04:06:57,079
All right, three, what's it on 24 and 300 still counting up charge is doing good at the bathroom

2217
04:06:57,079 --> 04:07:00,479
I keep going in the bathroom. Everybody keep Joel people keep saying check the bathroom

2218
04:07:00,479 --> 04:07:11,870
They're trying to be funny with me. This is something that's funny in the bathroom. They're trying to be funny with me spoilers

2219
04:07:12,069 --> 04:07:19,239
You know everyone was telling me to call you like two or three hours ago because I couldn't figure out how to play the game

2220
04:07:19,239 --> 04:07:25,899
And it was I had a little bit of a problem and I was like, I don't I he's like probably he's like

2221
04:07:25,899 --> 04:07:42,649
It probably could be eating dinner. He's probably I don't he could be busy. I was gonna call him dinner at 1 a.m

2222
04:07:46,139 --> 04:07:50,129
It took him two hours to do the tutorial no

2223
04:07:50,129 --> 04:07:54,840
It took me two hours to figure out how to play the game and then it took me about 40 minutes to do the tutorial

2224
04:07:54,840 --> 04:08:07,209
Alright, I gotta pay attention. Oh, wait, wait, wait. This has got to get to

2225
04:08:09,420 --> 04:08:22,620
306 it's gonna be coming up here soon very soon omega. Lull fleas. What did wait? What do you say? I missed it

2226
04:08:22,620 --> 04:08:24,079
You think I know dude

2227
04:08:24,079 --> 04:08:26,399
I played this game forever and I forget all the time

2228
04:08:26,399 --> 04:08:32,059
All I know is there's a funny alien with a green booger for a dong and he's out of his spaceship

2229
04:08:40,959 --> 04:08:47,370
I guess that's all there is to know, right?

2230
04:08:52,719 --> 04:09:11,680
Well, maybe I'll find him probably not though. I'm gonna be honest green booger. Are we doing again?

2231
04:09:11,920 --> 04:09:35,030
A ton of errors, please. Don't ever play this game again. Um, why not? What other color boogers are there? It depends

2232
04:09:35,049 --> 04:09:44,049
It could be green like yellow bloody brown. Why am I who cares? Why are we talking about this?

2233
04:09:50,680 --> 04:09:53,579
There's no reason to talk about this. Of course. There's other colors for boogers

2234
04:09:53,639 --> 04:10:04,920
You should know you just picked one out and ate it losing power losing power losing power losing power

2235
04:10:04,920 --> 04:10:11,899
I'm draining power right now for something. It's nighttime shit. I'm not even gonna get this frequency

2236
04:10:11,899 --> 04:10:13,899
Why do I have to be so far away about?

2237
04:10:14,100 --> 04:10:22,510
300 fuck was that was that was that what was that?

2238
04:10:22,510 --> 04:10:34,680
Well, stop stop stop stop everything stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop everything. What was that? What was that?

2239
04:11:07,360 --> 04:11:22,879
Was that the video feed for the coordinates I was passing or is he like in the house he's in the house

2240
04:11:23,200 --> 04:11:56,729
But where in the bedroom find him laugh my ass off. He's just running in the snow. I don't see him anywhere

2241
04:11:56,729 --> 04:12:10,159
He's not here. Wait, there's like green ectoplasm on this. Hold on a second. Did he like raid my fridge?

2242
04:12:10,399 --> 04:12:41,559
What does he do to my fridge? It's in the fridge. He peed on the fridge

2243
04:12:45,770 --> 04:12:56,500
Where is this little guy? I would love to use in the computer chair. All right, let's see. Let's find him

2244
04:12:57,020 --> 04:13:13,229
That video feedback on zero percent. How did I sleep from night to night? It's just nighttime again

2245
04:13:13,389 --> 04:13:32,799
You were abducted you lost 12 hours. Oh

2246
04:13:33,879 --> 04:13:37,719
Well, I'm just gonna go look around outside

2247
04:13:37,959 --> 04:13:50,360
Remember the clip the clip. Yeah, let me see. Where was he? Was he next to the refrigerator?

2248

2270
04:18:12,790 --> 04:18:20,209
I feel like somebody all the way up there has just got me just in the crosshair and they're just waiting for the perfect opportunity

2271
04:18:20,209 --> 04:18:34,850
And it's just gonna be oh, but I'm gonna just fall down. I'm gonna die go to the train tracks

2284
04:23:49,290 --> 04:24:17,590
What is this? Why is this here? This doesn't make any sense. Why is this like this? I'm telling you we ain't on earth

04:24:17,590 --> 04:24:25,219
Look at land it over there planet over there planet back here. You can't then then that thing whatever that is

2289
04:25:22,809 --> 04:25:41,459
It's coming this way. Whatever that is. It's moving closer. That's not a helicopter

2290
04:25:41,459 --> 04:26:08,819
No, it's not is that just where the UFO thing spawns just waits there until you do an activation for it

2291
04:26:08,819 --> 04:26:36,270
Every time I do the telescope it's gone. I'm gonna keep it in frame in my eyes if I look at it

2292
04:26:36,270 --> 04:27:21,780

2299
04:29:51,600 --> 04:30:12,739
That's the alien good deal. All right

2300
04:30:12,739 --> 04:30:14,739
I I think I might have had enough

2301
04:30:15,180 --> 04:30:21,229
Jeremy you stream three times per week for six hours and there are 168 hours in a week with this much time in your hands

2302
04:30:21,229 --> 04:30:26,600
You could be literally a serial killer for a hundred million off the debt prove that you aren't a killer by telling us what you

2303
04:30:26,600 --> 04:30:31,340
Generally do while off stream

2304
04:30:31,540 --> 04:30:41,030
but I genuinely do when I'm not streaming so I tend to I
