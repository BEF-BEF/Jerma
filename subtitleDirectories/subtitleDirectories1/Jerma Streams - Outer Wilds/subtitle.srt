1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:08,099
Hey, the title sucks. Yeah, I know. I just, I don't know anything about this game.

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,859
So I don't know how to title this game. I know it's about you're in space.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,609
You start, you look, you're searching. I don't know anything about the game.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,489
Just searching around space. You're yearning want to, I don't know, whatever it's staying. I don't care.

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,559
Uh, I know that, I know that this is a very spoiler filled video game.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,119
So I'm going to do my best to not pay attention to chat. It's gonna be really hard for me to do that.

7
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:39,859
And we'll be talking to pre stream chat about how, oh dude, just put it in sub only.

8
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,140
Well, um, I'm not sure that's going to do very much considering that almost all of you

9
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:50,500
at this point are subscribed to the channel. Uh, there's almost 11,000 subs on this channel.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,820
So all I would do would be flipping a switch that doesn't have a light bulb plugged in.

11
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,579
Maybe that's it. Let's, let's, let's turn the lights on for this one.

12
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,539
Oh, there's no bulb in there, but I flipped the switch.

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:12,599
So we're just going to let it, we're going to let it ride. Let it ride. Uh, I'm going to try to not

14
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,739
look too far into what people are saying. I'm going to just, I did a wink.

15
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:33,670
Good. I can see that. I can actually see a real one. All right. Uh, $50 from five.

16
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,989
Can we, okay. I'm going to rename you phylactery 50. Phylactery 50 is your new name because you

17
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:51,290
give $50 or more every single stream. You are, you've got, you've got money to spend

18
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,409
and I cannot believe you still give this much money. It's unbelievable. I can't believe it.

19
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,340
Thank you phylactery lich for the 5,000 bits. I'm actually going to get my, uh,

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,729
my better dashboard here. Uh, this is the way to play outer wilds today. I was going to do

21
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,650
Tony Hawk's underground, but, uh, we're going to have to move Tony Hawk's underground because I

22
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,490
needed an official Xbox 360 hard drive. It's been ordered. It just, you can't get it anywhere. I

23
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,210
can't get anywhere in real life. So I have to buy it online. So it's got a ship that we're going

24
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,770
to do that at the end of the week. I actually have a full plan for the rest of this week.

25
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,479
If you believe it, but phylactery, uh, said with his 5,000 bit donations. Hey,

26
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,840
Jerma played the DLC for a service wrath or I'll eat a delicious Caesar salad. Good stream last

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,599
night. Hope you enjoyed the game. Yeah, that's the plan. That's in the plan. You guys ready

28
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:54,099
for the plan? Here is the plan today. Outer wilds. No, not outer worlds, outer wilds.

29
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,650
This is a different game than the one you think it is. Maybe tomorrow outer wilds. Uh,

30
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,780
this game is apparently what 10, 12 hours long. We could probably split this into two, like six,

31
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,289
seven hour streams, something like that after that. So that's today and tomorrow for you,

32
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:22,150
it's going to be 20. Well, we'll see if we can do it in two, but today and tomorrow,

33
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,099
out of wilds, Friday, Tony Hawk's underground. I'll have the hard drive by then Tony Hawk's

34
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,620
underground. It can be done in one stream. I'm certain of it. Cause I remember playing it

35
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:40,539
Saturday Diablo to hardcore. Going after Diablo with our skeleton necromancer,

36
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,590
depending on how long that stream goes, possibly a sir's wrath DLC.

37
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:54,729
Now I also want to address this as well. Uh, the get well card I'd like to experience by myself.

38
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:58,889
I looked into it a little bit and that's something that I don't think I would like to stream.

39
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:08,419
I want to experience it on my own. Uh, it seems a little personal for me, so I definitely want to

40
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:18,500
over the next few nights do it on my own. Thank you everybody that's contributed. I'm not just

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,589
saying this. I'm actually going to go through every single slide over the next three or four

42
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:35,589
nights. So thank you again, but I do want to experience it on my own. The what a ton of

43
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:41,050
people contributed to a get well card for me, which is insane because I've had been having

44
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,730
some stupid, annoying, uh, medical problems with some rib cage bullshit and people are nice enough

45
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:55,000
to want to come together and do that. So thank you all of you. I will be experiencing it over

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,850
the next few nights. Uh, we had another $50 come in right now. 5,000 bits from AB Joe,

47
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,939
5,000 from phylactery, 5,000 from AB Joe. I always thought that the German Merc was wearing a scarf

48
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:18,170
or something. After looking at it on mobile, he just has a really weird chin. Well, it's Mercury.

49
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:32,120
It's just Thanos, but that's the plan for the remainder of the week. Should be some interesting

50
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,439
stuff here. I have not, I've outer wilds is one of those games. Remember we're,

51
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,959
we're fulfilling our quota on this stream of, I'm playing a game that came out within the last year.

52
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,240
We have to fulfill that quote. I've got to play at least one recent game for every 10 old games.

53
00:05:48,279 --> 00:06:01,910
You know, another link just come in. We're going to start to see a lot more of these

54
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:12,009
play devil may cry five. Oh fuck sake. I probably will, but we're going to do outer wilds. Let's

55
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,250
just move on to it. Let's go. I'm ready to go. Hopefully you're ready to go. Hopefully you've

56
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,339
got like a snack or something or something out of wilds. Now I got to remake sure I read it. I'm

57
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:30,779
going to re re re re iterate this again. I, I'm just going to kind of experience this game. I'm

58
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:36,139
not going to be paying too much attention to chat because I've been told, um, I can spoil

59
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,420
like the last season of this show in one sentence, right? So like, I got to be careful and please,

60
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,540
we're not going to do sub only, but just know that, you know, if you, if you, you know,

61
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,899
you drop a fucking spoiler line here, you're out, you're gone. Like you're gone. You're out.

62
00:06:51,899 --> 00:07:00,459
So we're, uh, I can't, I'm not going to put it in emote only. Don't ignore me.

63
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:13,189
Another wink come in? No. Wait, what? No, only what? Yeah. Another one just came in. What the

64
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:20,199
fuck? I'm just going to keep this up for a minute because I feel like we're going to get like a

65
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:30,410
shitload of these. Another one. No, I got, I actually have it up on my dashboard. I can see

66
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:39,240
when they're fake. Let's get started. Uh, I've been told that this is one of the best games of the

67
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,300
year from last year. I'm curious. I want to know why I'm playing with the controller, by the way,

68
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:52,699
I've heard the music's good. I've heard the game is good. I heard it's really fun. Really interesting

69
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:13,139
outer wilds. Are we ready? You're in normie normie loading. This is weird.

70
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,819
This game needs a controller to be good. Uh, I got one in my hands right now.

71
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:46,139
Wake up. Is it, is it FPS? Oh, it is FPS. Talk to slate. Roast a marshmallow. We're doing that

72
00:08:46,139 --> 00:09:07,980
first. Oh, God damn it. I've ruined it. Although you got to go all in. Yeah. Oops. If you end up

73
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,899
lighting it on fire, you got to go all in and then you, you pull the charcoal mess off the top and

74
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:34,230
you eat it. No, I wanted to eat it. Why am I so bad at this? I get so obsessive compulsive when

75
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,740
it comes to roasting marshmallows. Every single centimeter of this whole thing has to be a golden

76
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,779
brown or you go all in and you burn the fuck out of it. It lights on fire. And then like I said,

77
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:54,009
you peel it off like that. You let it burn, blow it out, pull off the weird exoskeleton that's on

78
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:59,610
it, eat the exoskeleton and suck on the fucking juices inside. All right. That was good. Let's go

79
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,480
There's already more gameplay than yesterday's stream. There's our pilot back from your pre-launch

80
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,820
campout under the stars I see. So it's launch day. It seems like only yesterday you joined the space

81
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,580
program and suddenly here you are leaving on your first solo voyage. What do you say? Ready to get

82
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:29,139
this beauty off the ground? It's all fueled up and ready to go. Uh, you sure you fixed the retro

83
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:35,029
rockets? That was only a problem one time and then maybe a few times after that. But hey, no reason

84
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:40,230
to dwell on the past, right? Anyway, you'll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the

85
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,070
observatory before you can lift off. Just bring those here once you said your goodbyes or whatever.

86
00:10:45,029 --> 00:11:05,639
Right to the point. I like it. Launch codes from Hornfels. Okay. Requires launch codes. Oh shit.

87
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:23,269
Uh, can I have a jump, a hold and release? That's kind of weird. Holy shit.

88
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:33,259
Fly model ship? Wait a minute. Hold on. Hey. Hey, it's you. Slate said you're blasting off

89
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,419
on your ship today. I'm really excited to see the launch. Aren't you going to go into space?

90
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:43,370
Aren't you? You better not have changed your mind. Uh, I want to practice before I leave. Oh, you're

91
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,929
just saying that. But if you really want to practice, I guess I could help you. I need,

92
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:50,649
I can learn how to fly. Try to land on one of the geyser pools. Show me what you got.

93
00:11:51,289 --> 00:12:08,090
Am I in it? I'm in this? Okay. That's not as easy as I thought it was going to be.

94
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:34,950
How do I drive it? How do you fly? Up, down thrust, horizontal thrust. Guys, I'm not,

95
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:49,179
I don't think I can do this. Horizontal, like you go forward. It's going, it's like doing way too

96
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:56,019
much thrust. You know what I'm saying? It's going like a, it's going too fast. It's less than four

97
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:11,019
buttons, Jerma. I, okay. How do you turn? Okay. I'm serious. I don't understand this. You're

98
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:19,529
thrusting too fast. It's, it's, is it pressure sensitive? I mean, I'm holding it down kind of.

99
00:13:20,330 --> 00:14:14,970
Was I not supposed to do that? And then the geyser. Is it my Xbox controller that's doing

100
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,710
it so much? It's like, I'm trying not to do too much pressure, but my Xbox one control is

101
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:37,220
a lot like blowing it out. I did it. I did it. Okay. That's I'm done, right? Leave. Okay. No,

102
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,899
I got it. I guess I, I guess I kind of understand. Wow. That was just like the time the external

103
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:48,539
fuel tanks exploded on reentry. You'll be okay flying the big one, right? I hope so.

104
00:14:49,259 --> 00:15:01,059
I don't know. You tell me. What is this? It's Corfi. Hey yo, Hatchling. I hear you're leaving

105
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:05,620
us to seek adventure amongst the stars. When you return, let's you, me, and Gawson open up a bottle

106
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,259
of that good stuff. I'm only seeking adventure amongst one star. Actually other stars are too

107
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:16,340
far away. Good stuff is less delicious sap wine and more daunting digestive challenge.

108
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:27,080
That's pretty funny. That looks like you. No, this, this guy looks like, you know, those images

109
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,240
that hurt your head when you put two eyes underneath somebody like you have humans eyes

110
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,200
and it's like that weird image where they have four eyes and it hurts your head looking at it.

111
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,580
That's what I see. An iron stomach is the mark of a true Parthian, my friend, our hardy hunter

112
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,500
gatherer lifestyle stem from the trial and error of which I mean our ancestors survived eating a

113
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:56,250
lot of bad things. All right, let's go. Where's my ship? There's a lot of people. You're actually

114
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,809
blasting off in that thing, huh? I told my odds of survival is statistically quite high.

115
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,289
Yeah, the space program certainly come a long way. I should probably thank you for causing fewer

116
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,889
flash fires than your predecessors. By the way, good luck with those retro rockets.

117
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,600
All right, for a second, I thought that was a something bad happening.

118
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,340
Outer Wilds adventures presents postcards from orbit. Use satellite camera. This projector is

119
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,100
linked to our sky shutter satellite, which is currently orbiting timber hearth. The satellite

120
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
is equipped with two onboard cameras. See if you can take a snapshot of our village.

121
00:16:33,220 --> 00:17:06,740
Where's the village? Oh, there's a geyser, right? Am I doing this wrong? All right,

122
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:22,119
there's a village right here, right? That's us. All right, cool. I got it. That's cool. All right,

123
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:31,299
moving on. What do you sell maps? Marl. So it's launch day. How's going to miss you? Speaking of

124
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,579
launch day, I was thinking about it in the platform. Those ships launched from is getting old.

125
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:39,779
Isn't it about time you built a new, less flammable one? That big tree in the village

126
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:46,220
would be perfect choice. I wouldn't mind helping the space program. Just say the word. Launch pad

127
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,859
is flammable? Ah, you didn't realize that. Don't worry. It's held up for the launches so far. It'll

128
00:17:50,859 --> 00:18:01,339
definitely be fine for yours probably. Oh, it's the guy with the guitar. Hello there, space cadet. I

129
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:05,180
hear you're leaving the crater today. If you meet any of the other travelers up there, remind them

130
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,299
to take proper care of their instruments, won't you? What are the instruments? Oh, sure. I made

131
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,940
all their instruments, you know. Let me see. There's church drums, Rybex banjo, and Gabro's

132
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:22,920
flute. And Feldspar's harmonica, of course. Though Feldspar's been missing for a long time. Sometimes

133
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,319
it feels like yesterday they were playing their harmonica around the campfire. Anyway, you hear

134
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,200
music in space. That'll be one of the space program's other travelers. If you feel like

135
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:40,420
company, you can always pull out your signal scope and track them down. All right, let's get those

136
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:51,500
launch codes. So many people to talk to. What are you guys listening to? Hello, astronaut. If it

137
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,299
isn't my favorite troublemaker, what's with the radio? We wanted to play hide and seek, but

138
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,299
Moiraine won't let us borrow their signal scope because it's really delicate and I'm not supposed

139
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:06,890
to be thrown around like that. Hey, can we use your signal scope? Can we? Can we please? Sure,

140
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,650
let's play. Well, okay. Here it's like a tutorial. Galena and me will hide with these radios and you

141
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,369
will use your signal scope to find us. Last one to be found wins. Okay, close your eyes.

142
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:28,730
I'm gonna open up. My money's gonna be gone. All right. Frequency. Change frequency. Zoom in.

143
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:50,009
Unknown. Isn't this the person playing the guitar? No, it's up there. How do I get up there?

144
00:19:52,539 --> 00:20:13,769
Shoot and add an NPC. I don't think so. Is this game dark? It's like the darks are too dark and

145
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:21,460
the lights aren't light enough for my screen. I don't know why. All right. Can I get up there?

146
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:40,700
Jump. All right. Found you. Got you. You found me. I did. Now, where's the other one? I get how this

147
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:51,980
works. Is there fall damage or anything? No. Up and down in here and then go. Can I die?

148
00:20:52,859 --> 00:21:20,859
Where are you? Like under the waterfall? I don't understand. Not there apparently. No. It's gonna

149
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:32,019
be up here. Oh, there you are. This shit is dark. You got me, but I'm the last one. I win.

150
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,819
I promise you'll play a game when you get back to the space. Okay, gotta go.

151
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:46,869
Me too. Let's get those coats. Should I or is it just this kind of personal area that's dark?

152
00:21:54,339 --> 00:22:02,059
Don't. Okay. All right. What the hell was that? Use camera. There's so many gadgets.

153
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:19,700
What are all these gadgets? What was that? Hi, astronaut. You know the patch of ghost matter

154
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,180
inside this fence? Ghosts said it used to be bigger when they were hatchets because ghost

155
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:30,339
matter evaporates. It just takes a super long time to go away. There's still ghost matter in

156
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:36,220
the village when I'm grown up. Ghost matter is awesome. You shouldn't be throwing rocks in there.

157
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,779
It's dangerous. Obviously, that's what makes it so awesome. Geez, I'm not dumb enough to touch it.

158
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:50,980
Oh, you're such a grown up. Yes, I am. I don't throw rocks and stuff. I saw smoke coming from

159
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,420
Young Bark Crater up north and figured I should go check it out. You can use the scout launcher.

160
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:07,849
Just please don't break it while I'm gone. Scout launcher, launch scout. What the fuck is going on?

161
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:17,930
Okay, so I get a fire. This is a cannon camera. Oh, it's still flying. Oh, shit.

162
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:28,650
All right. Get it back. I want to see what I look like. Hold on. What do I look like?

163
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:44,250
That's me, right? No, that's cool. Where are those coats? Gotta go to the observatory. Birds

164
00:23:44,250 --> 00:24:02,230
fly. Sun shines. All right. This way. Why does this remind me of Firewatch?

165
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,900
The walking with the acoustic guitar in the background is just... I'm waiting for the radio

166
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:24,890
to come up. All right. I'm going the wrong way. Big bits just came in. Oh, shit. They did.

167
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:38,470
You're right. Hold on. I just missed it. All right. Here we go. Whoa. Dude, it's bright. It's

168
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,190
really bright now. Oh, because the sun is coming up. All right. Now I get it. I get it. All right.

169
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:51,819
Yeah. Sun. Sunshine. All right. Hold on. Parfale Mule gave 5044 bits. Thank you, Parfale Mule.

170
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,349
50 bucks. This might be the only time I ever donate so many bits at once since I can by no

171
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:00,710
means afford it often. Don't ever give me money if you can't afford it for any reason.

172
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,960
Like, if you give this channel money, make sure you can afford it 100 times

173
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,039
before you even think to do it once. But very important. That's very important. But this is

174
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:17,319
my absolute favorite game of recent years, and I'm so excited and happy that my favorite internet

175
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:21,480
man has given it a chance. Hope you and Chad enjoy this masterpiece. Heard it's very good.

176
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:30,650
I've heard it's very, very good. Read that stuff. Read the... Oh, I'm not supposed to be looking

177
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,420
at Chad. All right. I'm not going to look at Chad. I'm not going to look at Chad. I'm not supposed

178
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:45,240
to be looking at you guys. Stars like our sun generate light and heat by fusing hydrogen into

179
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,240
helium. It's boring. As it grows older, the star runs out of hydrogen, starts to contract.

180
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:59,130
As the star's core contracts, it gets hotter, causing the outer layers to expand. The star has

181
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,690
become a red giant. When the core is hot enough, it starts to fuse the helium into carbon.

182
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:09,140
Man, I'm not going to lie, when I first passed this, I thought these were fruits. I thought it

183
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,099
was like apple, peach, nectarine. I didn't realize it. Like, when I walked by them and I glanced over,

184
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,619
I was like, oh, those are pretty good nectarines. If a star is massive enough, it will continue to

185
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:23,079
fuse carbon into even heavy elements like iron. Ultimately, the star will collapse under its own

186
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,980
gravity and then explode in a violent event called a supernova. Based on Chad's observations, this

187
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:38,180
will one day be the fate of our own sun. Manka. Fucking. S. Right, guys? This anglerfish specimen

188
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,500
was found attached to the landing gear of one of our ships that flew close to dark ramble.

189
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,420
It appears well suited to living in dark places with minimal atmosphere.

190
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:55,589
What's this? This crystal was taken from a Nomai ruin on Brittle Hollow. It seems to create a

191
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:59,509
local gravity distortion and was most likely used to traverse steep surfaces. Try it out.

192
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:06,579
Look. Get me out. Get me off. Get me off. Get me off. I'm gonna throw up.

193
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:17,180
If I had stood on that platform for another 10 seconds, I would have had to turn the stream off.

194
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:28,279
Well, I'm not. I'm serious. I'm dead serious. What you see here are parts of the Nomai skeleton.

195
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,680
We can, I'm sorry, I just bumped you in the face. We can tell from their skulls that they possess

196
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,799
antlers and quite usually, unusually only three eyes. The Nomai body was likely adapted for living

197
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:44,119
exclusively on land. The differences in the Nomai's anatomy, such as their shockingly fragile bones,

198
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:49,960
show us that Artheans couldn't have descended from Nomean ancestors. It's not clear where the

199
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,039
Nomai originated from or why they disappeared. We hope to find more clues to this puzzle

200
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:03,779
as we explore our solar system. Nice. This is a little museum. The sofa, chair or something,

201
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:08,980
or like a vase. Aside from the dwellings and structures they built, the Nomai also made art.

202
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,259
This decorated pottery was discovered on Brittle Hollow. Some ancient Nomai art depicts strange

203
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,940
animals, foreign celestial objects and other subjects that can't be found in our solar system,

204
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,339
which makes us wonder whether the Nomai originated elsewhere in the universe or simply had vibrant

205
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:28,900
imaginations. Were the Nomai born in our solar system or were they born among other stars and

206
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:37,400
planets? If they were, how and why did they come here? All this and more on this episode of NPR.

207
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,680
These are just some of the questions we hope to answer through further

208
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:53,460
Xeno-Archaeological Expeditions. Bowling balls. All right, pretty cool. I got all this info.

209
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,410
This is a face. This remarkably intact statue was carved by the Nomai, an ancient species who

210
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,369
dwelled in our solar system thousands of years ago. We keep touching on the Nomai here. The

211
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,529
statue provides us with our most detailed look yet at the Nomai, who appear to have been covered

212
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:14,569
with a layer of fur. Note the decorative jewelry that has been carved as part of the antlers.

213
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,849
Although their artifacts and structures have been found on almost every planet

214
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:23,849
in the solar system, we still have no idea where the species came from or what happened to them.

215
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:32,329
So this is kind of like Mayan history like we have now where it's like look, this is civilization and

216
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,809
they did all this stuff, they made all these things, but we don't know what happened to them.

217
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:48,069
Hey, it's my favorite streamer! Launch day at last, huh buddy? It's the translator of

218
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:55,609
TOOL's inaugural flight too. I'm so excited. It's making me nauseous. Just think, you'll be

219
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:00,579
able to translate any Nomai text you want anywhere you are. The two of us put a lot of hours into

220
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:09,430
inventing that tool, so don't break it, okay? Haha, oh geez. Haha, oh god, do not break it.

221
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,609
Uh, ignore me, okay? I'm just nervous and I'm not even the one going into space. How are you feeling?

222
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:20,059
I'm good, I feel good. Good, you've only been waiting for this day since we were hatchlings.

223
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,819
I can't wait to see all your training pay off. So what's the dirt? You're here to see the new

224
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:30,950
Nomai statue? Yeah, I knew you'd want to see before you headed off. Hornfell's just finished

225
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,750
prepping it for display today. Amazing, isn't it? Makes me wish we could see what a real,

226
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,470
live Nomai looks like. But I guess this is as close as we'll ever get. Check it out,

227
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,829
looks like they had fur. Fur is weird. It's the first fully intact statue ever found, you know.

228
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:51,529
And for how old it is, it's in great shape. Ah geez, I got a little carried away there. Go on,

229
00:30:51,529 --> 00:31:13,319
you have a ship to launch. Take care of yourself out there. Crew? So we're aliens, okay? All right.

230
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:19,029
Outer Wilds Ventures founding members. Clockwise from top left. Hornfell's,

231
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:31,049
Gawson, Slate, and Feldspar. Which one am I? Who am I? Am I my Esker? Hmm, what's that?

232
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,980
Outer Wilds Ventures Timber Hearth's first and only space program was founded to explore the

233
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,460
farthest reaches of our solar system. Feldspar was the first Arthian to be internationally,

234
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:46,309
intentionally launched into space. It completed the first orbit around Timber Hearth and later

235
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:58,619
made the first of what would be many landings on our moon, the Atoll Rock. Okay, nice. What's this?

236
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:01,930
This piece of Nomai writing was essential to deciphering their unique language.

237
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:06,410
Although this text is linear, Nomai text often branches off from a central point.

238
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,779
Interestingly, each branch tends to be written by a different author. Oh dude, that's fucking

239
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:21,769
pretty cool. That's actually really cool. From center out? That's pretty cool. All right,

240
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:28,299
untranslated writing. We're nearly ready. Felix and I have finished construction and

241
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:35,140
she says calibrating the device won't take long. What about that one? Oh wait, there's more.

242
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:41,269
Fortunately, the Atoll Rock's lack of atmosphere will make calibration simple. After all, this time

243
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:59,690
I'm thrilled to finally resume our search. What about that one? A Calab. All right, let's get those codes.

244
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:15,180
All right, you are here.

245
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:28,869
Giants Deep Timber Hearth Brittle Hollow. Okay, let's go. All right, give me those codes.

246
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:33,819
There you are. I just finished pre-flight observations and local conditions are good.

247
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:38,539
Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground. He'll be our first astronaut ever equipped with

248
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:43,819
a Nomai translator tool. I confess I've been giddy all day just thinking about it. We're better

249
00:33:43,819 --> 00:33:47,900
equipped than ever to unravel the mysteries of the Nomai. You and Hal should be very proud of your

250
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:56,730
work. Tell me, what's your plan once you're in space? Uh, I think I'm gonna start with something

251
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,279
small. That's a sensible plan. More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be and that's a

252
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:06,759
fact. You think you'll go to the Atoll Rock then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel and to

253
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:13,030
get your bearings in space and I'm sure Esker would appreciate the visit. Plus, we don't know

254
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,590
what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are or why they were built. You could put your new translator

255
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:26,420
tool to... All right, yeah, that sounds simple. Fly, right? I want to fly into the sun. Okay,

256
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,300
uh, yeah, man. Um, there ain't no translating text on the sun. Uh, you die if you go near it. Uh,

257
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,239
but we'll make sure we start training the other hatchlings to replace you real soon. Take a few

258
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,599
photos. Don't worry. I plan on taking at least three photos and then opening the window and

259
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,550
whipping the phone out and then one day somebody will find it. It's actually pretty interesting.

260
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:56,280
I got the idea because I found a cell phone flying around in space. There was a picture

261
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,659
of this planet with these giant fucking tentacles coming out of it. It's the new message in a bottle,

262
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:17,349
man. Get with it. Excellent. You'll be needing the launch codes. Here they are. Okay. Launch codes.

263
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:31,449
Dash dash dash dot dot dash dot. I don't know what that says. That's amazing lore enrichment.

264
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:45,530
Wait, hold on. What is this? Magic rock. This strange rock moving around in this grotto appears

265
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:50,730
to react to conscious observation. The level headed among us realized there must be some sort

266
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,929
of optical illusion in play, but Gabriel claims the rock exists in all possible states until it

267
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:00,630
is observed. Whatever is actually happening. Both sides of the debate agree the effect of

268
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:31,929
extremely creepy. I get it. That's pretty weird. Okay. Low IQ astronaut. You made it out of that

269
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:45,780
rock. Okay. I want to make a game of thrones reference so bad, but I can't. Did you let him

270
00:36:45,780 --> 00:37:02,360
touch you? Did he touch you? What the hell was that? It just absorbed everything I did.

271
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,429
Do it. No, I can't do it. All right. That was weird. Big thanks to these additional funding

272
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:16,949
members of Outer Wilds Ventures without whom we would never have gotten off the ground.

273
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:25,980
Matthew Steinhauer, Ben Etherington, Qwerty YouUpThePie, Jordan Frith, these kickstarter

274
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,300
people, Patreon subs, Tom Cummings, Sean Shark Templar Farrell, Steven Ursul Ryan Omrecker.

275
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:46,840
All right. Thanks guys. These are actual patrons of the kickstarter. That's pretty cool. That's a

276
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:56,489
neat little place to put it. All right. I got the codes. Hey, did you get a good look at the

277
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:03,210
Nomai statue? The statue was glowing. Why was it glowing? Whoa, whoa, whoa. The statue was doing

278
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:08,090
what? So it's eyes open and you saw images from your own memories and glowing lights flying around.

279
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:11,929
You mean like a hallucination? Listen, no offense, but are you sure you're okay to launch like

280
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:20,070
medically speaking? No, that statue is definitely weird. And if you're saying it happened, then I

281
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,550
guess maybe it did. But why? Wernfeld tried everything to get that statue's eyes to open

282
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,190
and nothing like this ever happened to them. I don't think you're going to get any answers from

283
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,230
the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giants Deep. I don't know which

284
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,949
island they're on though. Maybe they'd be able to tell you more. On the other hand, Gabbro is,

285
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:43,349
you know, Gabbro. So maybe you'd be able to even search for info on your own. He's a

286
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:47,670
fucking, you know, he's a dick. Geez, now I'm really jealous you're going into space. Hey,

287
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,550
see if you can use our translator tool to find out more about the statue. Okay.

288
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,469
Good luck. Is that a carrot? Oh, it's a stick.

289
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:42,699
It was a lot faster getting back here, guys. Come on. What do you mean it was not? Oh,

290
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:56,150
he's got the launch codes. Okay. Yes. I'm going to refill my health. Can I just eat them?

291
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:12,019
Here we go. Enter launch codes. All right. I was going to say this is not going to like

292
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:37,130
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, right? Let's go. What do I do? View ship log. View entry,

293
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:46,949
Timber Hearth. Rumor mode? Village. View rumored entry. I hear there are Nomai ruins somewhere in

294
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:52,630
the Attlerock. Oh, okay. So you get to. Sounds like Esker's still stationed at the Attlerock.

295
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,429
They've been there by themselves for a while. All right. Let's go. I'm going to the moon.

296
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:12,460
Suit up. Little scout. See beyond the horizon. Illuminate dark areas. Detect hazards. Test the

297
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:25,079
environment. Health and full fuel. All right. Let's, let's go. How do I close the door? All

298
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:59,800
right. Buckle up. Lift off. Landing camera. Lift off. Am I in space? Holy shit. This is crazy.

299
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:04,199
All right. Wait, what's that? I need to find the moon. Where's the planet I just came from?

300
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:12,900
Where's the planet I just came from? Right there, right? All right. I need to go to Attlerock.

301
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:18,360
Is that Attlerock? Brittle Hollow. No, I need Attlerock. I want to go to the moon first. They

302
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:34,699
said that was the easy one. Giant Steep. No. Ember. Right there. Brittle Hollow. No. Use the map.

303
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:48,679
You are here. The interloper. What is that? All right. We need Attlerock. There it is. Okay.

304
00:42:48,679 --> 00:43:04,409
Lock on. Let's go. Engage autopilot. Match velocity. How fast am I? Wait, it's right there.

305
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:11,960
It's right there. Okay. Slow down. All right. So I'm going to do autopilot. Engage autopilot.

306
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:32,340
I'm bigger than this planet is. Match velocity. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Where's

307
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:50,420
my miles per hour? I got to get picked up by the gravity. How do I get in here? Landing mode. What

308
00:43:50,420 --> 00:44:05,130
the fuck is happening? Is this right? This is the camera on the bottom, right? I'm not driving

309
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:23,590
straight into this, am I? No, I got it. Let's go. All right. Nice. All right. I made it. Do I have

310
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:32,550
all my tools? Hold on. Where are my tools? Equip scout launcher. Give the signal scope. No, no,

311
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:43,050
no. Put it away. All right. Unbuckle. Let's go. I have my suit on. Where's the hat? All right.

312
00:44:43,050 --> 00:45:02,119
Flashlight. Holy shit. I can... All right. All right. I need to find... What am I looking for?

313
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:14,199
I'm trying to find the base of operations. This is my ship. How do I equip my trans translator?

314
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:59,239
What's going on? What's wrong with me? My god. We're turning upside down. We're going upside down.

315
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:07,539
We're upside down. I don't like this. Okay. I need to find writing and some clues. Isn't there a

316
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:18,889
base here? Oh, this is Mario Galaxy, but the whole world does it. Not just one planet. Get out of

317
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:33,340
there. Get out of there. Let me get out of here. What is that thing? What is that? Run. What do you

318
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:54,250
mean run? It's the sun. What the hell is that? Oh, no. Someone's playing a harmonica. No, no.

319
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:07,099
That's my friend. It's a friend. Where are you? Wait, what is that? That's another planet.

320
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:16,199
This people is playing musical instruments. Hide and seek? Is there nothing on this planet?

321
00:47:17,989 --> 00:48:02,500
Jump to the other planet? Holy shit. I made it. Oh, we reviewed the logs.

322
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:08,789
Uh, I don't think, uh, I don't think he should have been the one on that case.

323
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:17,559
He tried to jump from a moon to a planet. Probably wasn't the smartest thing. Wait, what?

324
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,480
Atmospheric. Wait, am I? Hey, you ready to get this thing off the ground? Ship's all

325
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,079
fueled and ready to go. Did I just die? Oh, bad dream or something. You still look half asleep,

326
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:44,010
but that's a negative on being deceased. I know it's tradition to sleep out under the stars at

327
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:57,980
night before I launched. But if you ask me, it makes you a little jumpy. Did I not like that?

328
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:12,869
Okay. Uh, I have the codes. I do? Oh, I do. Oh, hold up. You're going to want to get the launch

329
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:21,659
codes from the observatory. I already got them. Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized. That

330
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,739
stuff is potent. Oh, if you get the codes, I'm not going to stop you. Good luck and take care

331
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:52,519
of that ship. Uh, you're huffing paint. This is the ship. Okay. All right. I'm go back to the moon.

332
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:59,940
I'm not jumping from planet to planet this time. Suit up. Okay. I got full fuel. Well, let's go.

333
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:20,599
Lift off camera. Okay. Now I get that LB hold to roll. You can actually do a full roll.

334
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:27,429
All right. Don't do that anymore. That's going to actually make me sick. All right. Let's go back

335
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:38,010
there. What the hell? I don't even understand what I did. Let's lock on. Oh my God. Pull up,

336
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:49,690
pull up, pull up. That was almost a disaster. Okay. Let's go. Same deal, except I just like

337
00:50:49,690 --> 00:51:00,519
shit on here. I have to do. What was the, what was the thing? I got to look at my log and slow down,

338
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:06,980
slow down, slow down, slow down. How fast am I going? I can't tell. I'm going kind of fast.

339
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:36,980
Yep. Right there. Let's see. There is something on here. I knew it. Landing mode. Jesus. We good.

340
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:52,550
Am I landed? We're good, right? All right. Let's go. All right. Let me see. What does this say?

341
00:51:53,190 --> 00:52:03,960
Here we go. Room with entry. Hey, there are no, my ruins on the adult rock. Okay. I saw them. Let's

342
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:29,050
go. We're here. Don't go so fast. Jesus. I'm going to get killed. It's up here. You have plenty of

343
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:42,900
fuel, right? So let's land here. Right here. All right. Found them. These are the ruins, right?

344
00:52:44,489 --> 00:53:01,289
Yeah. These look like ruins to me. Hold down A. All right. Come on. Pull this away. What the

345
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:06,389
fuck is going on? What the hell's going on? What's going on? This is going to, I'm going to get

346
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:22,760
hit by this. What is this doing? Uh, I go in. I'm going in. I broke it. How did I break it? Wait,

347
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:32,019
there's, there's writing. Too close. All right. Untranslated. Holy. I was upstairs testing the

348
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:37,139
eye signal locator and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun. Giants deep and brittle

349
00:53:37,139 --> 00:54:12,900
hollow. Hold on. Let me go get Otto. I don't want to come in the room. Perfect. I can hear him

350
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:27,190
yelling at me. It's like, Hey, open this door right now. Yeah. I just really happened. No,

351
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:34,039
no. He just wanted to come in the room. He gets really annoyed if you, if he's not hanging out

352
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:39,699
in the room with you. If he's not in the room with me, he'll just be like, um, excuse me.

353
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,019
What the fuck am I not doing in there? And I'm like, yeah, you're right. Get in here.

354
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:52,739
My special boy. All right. What does it say? I was upstairs testing the eye signal locator

355
00:54:52,739 --> 00:55:00,420
and it can, and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun. What else you got?

356
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:05,130
Oh, for something strange is happening. When I asked the eye signal locator to follow the

357
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:11,289
eye signal, the devices indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.

358
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:21,099
This is a curious result. It's possible the eye has stopped calling out its signal.

359
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:28,500
I see. I most likely calibrated the locator incorrectly private. My apprentice and I will

360
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:35,619
make adjustments and try again and update. Disappointingly, everything is correctly

361
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:45,690
calibrated after all. It saddens me to post it. This post this my friends, but I believe we need

362
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:50,489
to build a more sophisticated device. If we want to find the exact location of the eye of the

363
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:59,110
universe, then we will build it. Don't lose hope. Our search for the eye is what brought our clan

364
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:12,039
to this place. We won't give up so easily. Freeze detected. Oxygen tank refill. Oh, wait.

365
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:21,980
Oh, I have oxygen, right. They're looking for the eye of the universe. What's this? Okay. Wow.

366
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:26,250
Wow. I've seen this route in other travelers pictures, but seeing it for myself,

367
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,610
it's really old, isn't it? But wow, this is the coolest day of my life. Okay. Um,

368
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:36,099
time for some official notes. This is some kind of, uh, know my locator and point out the different

369
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:41,380
planets, which is incredibly cool by the way. But from what little I can understand of the writing

370
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,460
here, I think it was built to try to find something specific. I'm not sure. I also

371
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,730
was able to translate something about the South pole of brittle hollow. So I'll fly there to see

372
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:56,230
if I can learn more South pole of brittle hollow. Yup. Just going to get back in the old ship and

373
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:08,730
take off. Totally safe. Mostly stay safe. Oh, stars above. Okay. What's this scroll? What does this

374
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:17,480
do? Put it in here. Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to

375
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:25,210
be larger than this eye signal locator. The Southern glacier on brittle hollow has some

376
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:32,630
available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator. Yes. Let's build

377
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:37,750
there. I imagine our young friend Connolly would enjoy that immensely. He's always held a great

378
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:44,409
interest in the eyes, especially for a child born so long after the crash. I'll begin construction

379
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:56,059
on brittle hollow South pole immediately. And Nana and those of us originally stranded on the

380
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:02,179
ember twin built a quantum moon locator there. The heat of the sun made its construction

381
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:09,050
challenging. I wouldn't recommend building on that planet. Okay. Don't go to the ember twin.

382
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:19,079
Don't. Okay. Brittle hollow South pole. Is there any more? What's this thing? What's that? What's

383
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:26,699
this? What's this thing? What does that do? Build the oxygen. All right. You touch a tree,

384
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:32,070
you get oxygen. That makes sense. All right. Let's go to the brittle hollow. Anything else I can do

385
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:40,809
stand in the middle and scream. All right. You can't get killed by these things. That's good.

386
00:58:40,809 --> 00:59:16,820
Where's my ship? Why can I hear of somebody playing a flute? That's the ruins they were

387
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:23,239
talking about. Is there anything else here? I don't jump off the edge like a idiot. Like I

388
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:33,860
did last time. Chip is down there. I want it to be sun. All right. Bring the sun up here.

389
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:52,579
Is that here? Where is that? Oh, that's on that planet. Okay. That's on this planet. There's no

390
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:57,940
noise. There's no noise or anything on this one. Hey, jump to that planet. You could make it.

391
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:21,780
Oxygen. Do I have plenty? Is there anything else to see here? I do appreciate that little mini map

392
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:28,579
over there because it shows the trail, the drunk ant trail that I've made. So at least I know where

393
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:38,659
I've been. This is the ship. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. I'm just free falling right

394
01:00:38,659 --> 01:00:45,960
now. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. Don't die. All right. Hold on.

395
01:00:46,679 --> 01:01:02,329
I don't think these little glaciers, these look really cool. What is that? Oh, okay. Hold on.

396
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:15,130
Land on that. Oh, land on the Smash Brothers stage. Come on. I can do it. What is this?

397
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:26,679
Esker's signalscope log. Day 48. Still not picking up Rybeck's banjo from Brittle Hollow. Sure,

398
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:32,900
they're fine, but I'll feel better once I can hear their music. Day 51. Listen to Chert play for a

399
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:38,659
while. Unrelated. Someone should tell Porphy and Gosan their flirting is not suitable for an aerial

400
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:44,389
perspective. Banjo music coming in loud and clear today. Sounds like Rybeck's doing okay. That...

401
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:50,059
Oh, I was worried. A week later. Today I thought I heard something strange. I don't know. It was

402
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:54,889
probably nothing. No, it's back again today too. Something strange is coming from Timber Hearth.

403
01:01:55,449 --> 01:02:00,070
Okay, I know this is crazy, but the sound from Timber Hearth sounds exactly like Feldspar's

404
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:06,539
harmonica, but Feldspar disappeared in space ages ago. It can't be them. It's still here. This is

405
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:34,340
creepy. Maybe my signalscope is broken. I better talk to Nice. There it is. Right there. What is

406
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:53,769
that? It's like an asteroid. All right, I want to go there. Anything else over here? Jesus. I'm almost

407
01:02:53,769 --> 01:03:00,329
out of oxygen. I need a tree. Unidentified signal nearby. Three minutes of oxygen remaining.

408
01:03:00,969 --> 01:03:12,949
I mean, unidentified signal nearby. What are these living up here? The person didn't have

409
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:20,250
a space suit on. Hey, do you have any oxygen? Don't go in the fire. How do you not have a

410
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:26,940
space suit on? You got marshmallows? Of course you do. Wait, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. What?

411
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,659
Why would I take off my suit? Oh, marshmallows are so important.

412
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:48,250
Wait, I can do this? What's the deal with the marshmallows? Is there something about this

413
01:03:48,250 --> 01:04:00,329
that's important? Stop burning them. I like them like that. Look, I know. I know that there's,

414
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:24,519
you know, like a personality test of how you cook your marshmallows. I know. All right, let's talk.

415
01:04:24,519 --> 01:04:29,320
Oh, hey, it's you. Ground Control didn't tell me you were launching. Long time no see. Actually,

416
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:36,179
I guess it's been a long time since I've seen anyone. What is it? What are you doing up here?

417
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:40,179
Haha, very funny. Oh, stars above. You're serious, aren't you? That's just depressing.

418
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:45,219
Welcome to the lunar outpost, which apparently the space program doesn't bother to teach

419
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:50,420
anyone anymore. When we first started Outer Wilds, travelers used to bring their ships here all the

420
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,539
time for repairs. Our space bearing technology has improved loads since then, but the older ships

421
01:04:55,539 --> 01:05:03,769
tend to fall apart a lot. Like more than they do now. Using the outpost cut down on the number of

422
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:09,420
launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires. Nowadays though,

423
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,059
it's mostly just me up here raising saplings from timber hearth and keeping an eye on things.

424
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:24,940
Don't go. I mean, anything else you want? Did anyone else come by? The lunar outpost saw

425
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,460
more traffic back when our ships were less sophisticated and needed more frequent repairs.

426
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,980
Nowadays, it's mostly used to keep a set of eyes on things. Sometimes Chert comes by to say hi,

427
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,780
but Gabbro is Gabbro. And you know how Ryvek feels about unnecessary spaceflight.

428
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:47,429
Is it you whistling? Probably, or actually definitely. The other travelers carry instruments

429
01:05:47,429 --> 01:05:51,909
so they don't bother whistling. You can pick up their music with a signal scope, you know.

430
01:05:51,909 --> 01:05:56,789
Best spot for that is the North Pole. Great reception. North Pole is marked in red on

431
01:05:56,789 --> 01:06:00,309
your minimap, but the Attle Rock is a pretty small moon, really. Just go north. You can't miss it.

432
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:06,460
I already went there. All right, goodbye. What do you got? Radio? What's in your house?

433
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:16,570
What's in your house? This is where we're going to find the fucking bodies. I'm going to like

434
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:23,719
put the signal scope down here and you're going to just... I thought I... No, never mind. The sun

435
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:35,579
looks kind of red. I mean, the sun is red, isn't it? All right, let's go over here.

436
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:47,989
That's kind of Monka S, dude. I love that emote. It just can be used anywhere.

437
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:56,329
You can use Monka S in any scenario. And it's just... All right, we're already here. All right,

438
01:06:56,329 --> 01:07:07,510
I'm out of here. I'm going to go to that... Don't go so fucking fast. Okay, I'm out. What is this?

439
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:20,460
Spaceship. Wait, what's in here? Can I investigate this or something? What is this?

440
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:43,619
I can't do anything with this. I don't know what that is. Let's go. I can't interact with it. Wait,

441
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:54,570
can I go in it? Is it like a hatch or something? There's a hole right there. Can I go in? All right,

442
01:07:54,570 --> 01:08:05,960
let's just go back to the ship. Is this... Is what I'm doing stupid? Is what I'm doing stupid?

443
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:11,400
Oh no, no, no. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?

444
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,680
Oh god damn it. No, I'm out of space. I'm going to die out here. I'm going to die out here. I'm

445
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:28,819
going to die out here. Get back in the gravity. Slow down. Slow down. Stop. All right, let's get

446
01:08:28,819 --> 01:08:43,270
in the ship. Refuel the jet pack and let's go to Brittle. Let's go to my log book. I see... Oh,

447
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:53,590
holy shit. Look at this. We have more quests that connect. Oh, what? Okay, hold on.

448
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:58,500
Uh-huh, this is where I started. Here we are.

449
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,020
We can go here.

450
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:35,609
Let's go. I just monk-a-est so hard. Are you good? All right, I gotta put that in my...

451
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:43,300
Brittle Hollow. South Pole of Brittle Hollow. What's this? What planet is this?

452
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:54,539
You are... What is this? Like, how come it's not listed? Brittle Hollow. There it is. All right,

453
01:09:54,539 --> 01:10:11,079
this planet looks kind of dangerous. All right, let's go. Brittle Hollow. 19 kilometers. I

454
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:17,350
probably shouldn't fly near the sun. I'm not going to go near the sun. I'm not going to do that. That

455
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:32,899
seems like a bad idea. Brittle Hollow. Let's go. South Pole of Brittle Hollow, right? Does this ship

456
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:50,090
run out of gas? The ship doesn't run out of gas, right? All right, that's good. Am I even going

457
01:10:50,090 --> 01:11:07,939
towards it? Uh, 600 miles a second. 700... Was that miles? Was it, like, milloper... millipers?

458
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:23,430
1000 millipers a second? I don't know what this is. Go up and go up. I'm going so fast.

459
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:39,449
All right, let's do that easier. That was... That was too many millipers a second. Yeah.

460
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:51,109
Okay, coming up. Here we go. Let's load this... Derma's a super brumer. This planet, it's just so

461
01:11:51,109 --> 01:11:57,819
small. The sun's fucking this whole thing up. Autopilot. No, I have to be able to do it.

462
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:30,890
I'm lined up perfectly. Here we go. Load done. I'm slowing down. Dodge it! Dodge it! Dodge it!

463
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:44,390
Where is it? I have to learn how to do... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. We're fine, we're fine.

464
01:12:45,350 --> 01:13:11,819
There we go. Get that landing gear out. All right, get it... All right, we're good.

465
01:13:15,989 --> 01:13:26,789
Yep. All right. Looking at the South Pole. South Pole. Looking for the... the eye. They made an eye.

466
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:41,380
What the hell was that? Did I just miss something cool? There's, like, a meteor over here.

467
01:13:55,909 --> 01:14:20,229
Uh, what happened? What did I do? What did I do? Why was it just, like, an atomic bomb?

468
01:14:21,109 --> 01:14:35,460
Okay. I didn't do anything. Am I not supposed to be on that planet? Did the game get angry with me

469
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,020
because I went on a planet that I wasn't supposed to be on? Was that, like, a gear check? Like,

470
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:51,210
wait, you're not supposed to be in this part of the story yet. Nukem! Well, all right. There's our

471
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:55,420
pilot ready to get this beauty off the ground. You know the ship is a deathtrap, right? You're

472
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:00,859
lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead. The sun is going to supernova, by the way.

473
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,939
What? You're lucky I'm in a time loop, because otherwise I'd be dead.

474
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:08,789
And you're lucky I don't have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what

475
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:27,319
you're talking about. Huh. All right. Can I go to that planet? Should I try something else?

476
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:39,529
I'm going back to that planet right now. Hold on. Did I get any new info? Where is this? What's this

477
01:15:39,529 --> 01:15:44,890
one? Esker's signal scope log reports harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth.

478
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,489
Sounds like Feldspar's harmonica, but Feldspar just... We're going...

479
01:15:49,689 --> 01:16:03,930
Which one? I'm gonna try this one again. All right, let's go. What's this? Planetary chart about a

480
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:18,500
while. So, okay, that's kind of necessary. Buckle up. Our hero. Where's, like, the nuke? Okay, does it...

481
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:31,220
Is it on this map somewhere? Follows lantern. That's the thing that... That's the thing that

482
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:37,260
exploded. Remember I said, whoa, what was that? Like a meteor just landed. Is this... This thing

483
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:59,979
crashes into this planet? Let's investigate. Just autopilot. All right, I have autopilot on.

484
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:13,260
Wow, that's so much easier. Why did I not do autopilot ever? That couldn't have been more

485
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:19,529
simple. Well, I unlocked it, so it's just different. All right, what happened here?

486
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:24,859
I unlocked the planet, so I unlocked it for fast travel. That's my... That's what I'm gonna say.

487
01:17:25,579 --> 01:17:36,739
Okay, let's go. South Pole, right? Let me go take a... Is this gonna happen?

488
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:49,100
They said... Okay, I told you, see? It's just... Hell's just raining down here. I'm just not

489
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,260
supposed to be here. This is too... I'm here too early. I'm here too early. I have to get, like,

490
01:17:53,260 --> 01:18:02,550
the anti... I have to get, like, the anti-meteor shield or something. All right, South Pole.

491
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:22,220
Unidentified signal. Freeze. Wait, unidentified signal. This guy, that sounds like a blue whale.

492
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:32,869
Or a car on the highway that's going by really fast that's holding the horn down.

493
01:18:33,590 --> 01:19:01,739
It's right there. What is it, though? I'm going up. Jetpack. Hold... I want to... Hold...

494
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:14,630
Hold A. Jetpack booster. Why is it doing this? Power shard. Why is it doing this?

495
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:24,140
Plume. Felix and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this

496
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:35,270
grove are behaving in a quantum manner. Okay. How do you behave in a quantum manner? Of note,

497
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:40,470
a unique signal is coming from this shard. Curiously, a friend, the wandering moon,

498
01:19:40,470 --> 01:20:01,399
sounds the same. I've also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from giants deep

499
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:09,300
timber hearth and the hourglass twins. Suppose there are other shards like this.

500
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:19,130
The only other object we've observed displaying this quantum behavior is the wandering moon.

501
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:27,050
I imagine the moon's behavior in this groves are related. In her note from earlier, Felix mentions

502
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:31,050
this strange type of rock isn't found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow. What if it isn't originally

503
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:38,760
from this planet? Hypothesis. This quantum shard is from the wandering quantum moon.

504
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:51,750
Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself. What is this wandering moon? All right.

505
01:20:51,750 --> 01:21:20,250
Okay. So it says the South Pole. Don't hit your face. Okay. All right. South Pole.

506
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:34,729
There's some, isn't somebody supposed to be here? Watch out. Yeah, this is an observatory here. Okay.

507
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:51,640
So when somebody was be working here that I know. Oh, am I right? Okay. Ship. Oh damn. All right.

508
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:57,510
There's a way to go down here. Whose ship is this? Outer Wilds Ventures. It looks like it's working.

509
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:11,640
Somebody already in here. I'm here. I did it. I put the ship down safely. All right.

510
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:17,079
Um, and that ship, in that, in that the ship went down and I didn't sustain bodily harm.

511
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:26,659
A few minor repairs and it's like, I just, I just spilled coffee on my cup. It's good news.

512
01:22:26,659 --> 01:22:30,340
The bad news is I haven't found a way inside the structure yet. The door is broken and hold on.

513
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:40,579
I like was about to take a sip. I jittered. I jittered. My hand jittered a little and it

514
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:45,779
spilled a tiny bit on my lap. Sorry. I'm not great at exploring, but I think I would have found a

515
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:52,819
different entrance by now. If there was one, probably. I can't get inside from here, but I

516
01:22:52,819 --> 01:22:57,460
know there are paths below the surface. I'm going to head north to the ruins on the equator. Try to

517
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:14,340
find a way down. Let's open it. That didn't work. All right. So there's a place. There's a cave to go.

518
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:20,779
What's it? What is this? Are we on emote only mode because people are going to give spoilers?

519
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:29,319
Yeah. I don't want to be spoiled. What is up here? Can I go in there?

520
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:44,579
You have to communicate in pictures to me. What is that scope? I want to see. Zoom in. Can I get a

521
01:23:44,579 --> 01:24:10,170
signal from anything? I think I have what I want. Get this away. I can't get in here anyway. What

522
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:16,890
was he talking about when he said under the equator is a place to get in. I guess I should

523
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:39,479
go over here. I got plenty of fuel, right? I'm going this way. I'm so scared to get hurt.

524
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:46,699
All right. What about like right here? Oh, oh, oh my God. Oh my God. What is this?

525
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:52,619
What is this black hole? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, fly, fly, fly, fly,

526
01:24:52,619 --> 01:25:29,899
fly. Can I fly? Grab on, grab onto the edge. Come on, grab onto something. I can't grab onto this.

527
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:37,460
Three minutes of auction. Come on, grab on, get in, get inside. What is this? What the hell is that?

528
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:57,500
I just opened a fucking ancient sarcophagus. Okay. What the hell is this? It's gravity.

529
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,859
Welcome to the White Hole Station. You fell through the black hole by accident. Don't worry,

530
01:26:06,859 --> 01:26:14,630
you aren't the first. This warp tower can return you to Brittle Hollow. Every warp tower is turned

531
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:21,079
to a specific astral body. To use the tower, stand on the warp platform on the floor and wait until

532
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:24,439
the tower aligns with its corresponding astral body, in this case, Brittle Hollow.

533
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:29,819
If you look up while the station is rotating, you can see the alignment happens when the

534
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:49,050
astral body is directly overhead. What the fuck are you talking about? Wait, this is recording.

535
01:26:49,050 --> 01:27:10,100
Pick up Ember Twin Projection Stone. What? Oh, that's not... What should I do with this?

536
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:23,140
Ember Twin Projection Stone. Alright, like, Ember Twin's a planet. Okay, I'm gonna bring this with

537
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:29,479
me to Ember Twin, right? I'm gonna bring this with me to Ember Twin and I'm gonna use it there.

538
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:41,739
How do I get there? Alright, I have to wait for Brittle Hollow to come into frame? I don't

539
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:48,300
understand. Okay, look up and wait for... Wait, oh, wait, wait. Is it when it gets to there, right?

540
01:27:49,020 --> 01:28:08,020
I just have to wait till it gets to be 12 o'clock and then I do it. Look up. This thing doesn't move.

541
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:39,079
Alright, I'm going for it. Wait, I can't see. I'm going in. This is just space again. What is

542
01:28:39,079 --> 01:28:46,020
going on? What am I... What's this doing? What should I do with this? I just have this ping-pong

543
01:28:46,020 --> 01:29:11,340
ball. What do I do? Do I go in here? I'm stuck in this thing. I don't know what to do. I really

544
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:18,420
don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm confused. Alright, it said look up and then go

545
01:29:18,420 --> 01:30:22,260
into the... Step into the thing? I'm confused. This did move. This is glass. Okay, this way...

546
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:26,760
I thought that... This is made out of glass. Alright, alright, alright. It's safe down here.

547
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,750
Okay, alright, alright, alright. It's safe down here. It's made out of glass. I didn't know it was

548
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:50,390
made out of glass. Okay, wait. It's following me around. I did it. What do I do? What's it doing?

549
01:30:50,390 --> 01:31:03,850
Where am I going? Uh, where am I going? Is this a monorail? Do I just stay on this?

550
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:13,270
There's my ship. There's my ship. Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. That's my ship.

551
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:20,810
I need to get up there now. Alright, let's go. Oh, we're spinning. Okay, look up and then when

552
01:31:20,810 --> 01:31:41,340
I'm ready, I say stop. I... Alright, now? Go? Alright, where the... I don't know where I am.

553
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:51,689
Where am I? Quick translator? Return warp status charge. Step onto the warp platform when ready.

554
01:31:51,689 --> 01:31:59,800
Okay, that's a... So, this is a warp platform. What do I do with this thing?

555
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,579
Shit! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Back, back, back, back, back, back. Go back, back, back, back,

556
01:32:05,579 --> 01:32:09,670
back, back, back. But back, back, back, back. Go back in there. Go back in there. Oh, God.

557
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:19,289
Go back in there. Ready? One, two, three. Okay, don't do that again.

558
01:32:19,289 --> 01:32:24,869
What do I do with this projecting thing? Alright, what's down there?

559
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:32,909
here? Oxygen? Re-fuel jetpack. I don't mind if I do. What is this? Elspar spare jetpack

560
01:32:32,909 --> 01:32:37,750
fuel. It's annoying to schlep across the planet for the ship if I can't use my jetpack so

561
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:44,149
I'm leaving this here. I check with my little scout. I do too use it. Corn fells. You burnt

562
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:50,199
marshmallow. And the scout's integrity reading said this piece of brittle hollow is as stable

563
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:53,000
as any. I just, I don't know why I read that. I read that like almost like I was reading

564
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,640
words out of place. But who knows? If fuel's still around, fit for it to use it, I'm not

565
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:05,920
well, wherever you're reading this, I'm sure you, whatever. Language. Languages. Langu-

566
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,779
wait, drop. What should I do with this? There's a language here. Hold on. The hanging city

567
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:23,029
below 50 meters. Hanging city? Hanging city. What is this? What planet am I on? I'm on-

568
01:33:23,029 --> 01:33:29,739
alright, alright, alright, alright, let's go. I thought this was supposed to be Hanging

569
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:39,750
City. Below 50 meters. Well, why did you say that? There's nothing here. Um, there's bones

570
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:57,989
here. Alright, there's more things to read. What is this? To our friends on Brittle Hollow,

571
01:33:57,989 --> 01:34:03,880
I just warped here from the white hole station. Our design worked. We've successfully recreated

572
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,399
warp travel. This is wonderful news. I can't wait to see the warp tower. It's been a long time since

573
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:15,210
I've jumped through a black hole. I don't know how close it is to the known as original design,

574
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:18,970
but as long as what we build works, then I'm delighted. I knew we could do it. If you're

575
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:24,810
reading this. Wait, this can't be correct. Clarie, have you seen these readings? If they were

576
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:31,479
accurate, they would violate causality. There must be an equipment error somewhere. I'm returning to

577
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:36,119
the white hole station. If you and Root meet me there, we can run a full diagnostic and hopefully

578
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:47,930
locate the problem. Don't tell Casaba. What the fuck do I do with this thing? There's a gap here

579
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:54,260
slotting. Put this in right here. All right. Put it in. I got it. All right. Did it. All right.

580
01:34:54,260 --> 01:35:01,079
Read. What does it read? What does it say? Rami and I reviewed the records you sent, Pokey,

581
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:06,359
and they appear to show Nomai are arriving at the warp receiver on Brittle Hollow slightly before

582
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:15,220
departing from the white hole station. As I've already told Rami, these measurements can't be

583
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:21,220
accurate. How can Nomai arrive on Brittle Hollow before he or she ever stepped into the teleporter?

584
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:27,319
The implications are absurd. I don't disagree. It would mean I've inadvertently broken several

585
01:35:27,319 --> 01:35:32,119
fundamental theories regarding this universe. We would have to reconsider all of our beliefs

586
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:41,189
about the nature of time. Yes, I hope so too. Pokey, as Pie is confident the reading is inaccurate,

587
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:44,869
she's kindly helping me attempt to recreate this phenomenon at the High Energy Lab.

588
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:51,159
We're designing an experiment to take more data. An update, Pokey. The High Energy Lab is in the

589
01:35:51,239 --> 01:35:55,239
canyon on Ember Twin's equator. Come here at once. You need to see this.

590
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,890
I understand it's exceedingly odd, but Larry and I have tested and retested the equipment.

591
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:06,100
The result is the same every time someone warps. The interval is incredibly miniscule, roughly

592
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:10,739
one hundred thousandth of a second. Do you suppose our instruments can't accurately measure time to

593
01:36:10,739 --> 01:36:19,989
such a small degree? We got it. High Energy Lab on Ember Twin's equator. Should I take this out?

594
01:36:20,789 --> 01:36:42,779
It is. The hell just happened? What's going on? What's just like magic quicksand? I'm going back.

595
01:36:42,779 --> 01:37:04,260
I'm. What the hell is going on? Oh, wait. Was I looking into the future or the past or something?

596
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:20,939
What was I just looking at? I'm going to leave that here. I want to see it again. If I stay in

597
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:24,460
here for too long, am I going to like rot my brain or something? All right. That's where I am.

598
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:33,380
This is it. This must be the other planet. Sick. OK. All right. All right. I'm going to leave that

599
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:44,489
there. Is there another place to put it? I don't think there's another place to put it. OK,

600
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:54,710
cool. Let's get some oxygen. How do I not have oxygen? I read that. What's this? What about

601
01:37:54,710 --> 01:38:01,079
noises? Great sounds. Hide and seek. Outer wilds. Ventures. Quantum fluctuations. Outer wild

602
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:22,569
ventures. Let's see. How's my ship over there? What the hell happened to the ship? Why is it

603
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:34,810
over there? Can I not get off this planet ever? How am I going to get in? How am I going to get

604
01:38:34,810 --> 01:38:50,859
over there? What is it doing over there? I have three minutes of oxygen. What happened? OK.

605
01:38:52,060 --> 01:39:03,500
Oh, my. Wait. Unknown. This is sound over here. Pull it back. Vitals critical. It's OK.

606
01:39:05,079 --> 01:39:17,210
Why is my ship all the way out here? What's something here? 66 meters down. What? Where is

607
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:32,810
it? This planet's crazy. Look at this shit. This is crazy. Wait. All right. This stuff

608
01:39:32,810 --> 01:39:39,609
is explosions and shit happening. I'm going over here. Unidentified signal nearby. Where?

609
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:57,399
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Down there. It's a guitar. What is it? OK. Where are you?

610
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:09,050
Wait. No, no, no. Not in there. Where are you? Where the fuck is this person? What is that?

611
01:40:10,409 --> 01:40:32,899
I got nuked again. All right. That's the second time that's happened.

612
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:45,210
It's replaying everything I've looked at. OK. That's a that's like a time travel thing.

613
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:51,829
I get it. So I'm that we get to see everything I did. But the nuke is like a time explosion.

614
01:40:51,829 --> 01:40:59,189
Yeah, that's has to be what's going on. Like, why would it show me literally everything I just did?

615
01:40:59,189 --> 01:41:05,189
All right. Well, why is that happening, though? Ready to get off this ground. Hey,

616
01:41:05,189 --> 01:41:13,050
what can I do for you? I'm going to time loop. All right. Yeah. All right. How am I triggering

617
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:33,300
that to happen, though? Is it just like scripted? OK. Let's go back. I got a bunch of new info,

618
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:41,020
though. I got a ton of new info. Quantum shard. This one's like a legendary quest.

619
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:53,800
Oh, that's a legendary quest. That's just a normal one. This is just like a green. This is

620
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:59,079
like legendary. And this is like epic or something. I don't know. Quantum shards.

621
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:02,199
I have rumors about them, but this one's curious to me.

622
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:09,060
The North Pole of Brittle Hollow is covered in snow and ice. There's a uniquely shaped

623
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:13,220
Nomai ruin on the surface. Nomai were able to warp here from the White Hole Station. This is

624
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:18,340
where they first recreated warp technology. There's more to explore here. I was about to do it.

625
01:42:19,859 --> 01:42:26,659
OK. Every there's a lot of info. Every Nomai warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body.

626
01:42:26,659 --> 01:42:30,020
To use the tower, stand at the warp platform and wait until the tower aligns with its corresponding

627
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:37,100
astral body. Nomai noticed something strange. Warped objects appeared to arrive at the receiver

628
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:43,140
on Brittle Hollow slightly before they departed. This negative time interval between an object

629
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:47,609
arriving and departing was incredibly minuscule. Nomai were skeptical if their equipment could

630
01:42:47,609 --> 01:42:50,649
even measure time to such a small degree. And then over here is the energy lab.

631
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:57,739
High energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twins equator. That's where we're going.

632
01:43:01,180 --> 01:43:11,739
High energy lab. Ember Twin. Let's go. I want to investigate that ship. Gear options?

633
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,619
Jetpack boost mode auto. Translator equip mode. Freeze time while reading.

634
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:34,439
Does that matter? Alright. I need to uh... Ember Twin, right? You are here. Where's Ember Twin?

635
01:43:35,319 --> 01:43:55,050
Hourglass Twins? Ember Twin. I gotta go here. We can't lock on. OK, there we go. Hourglass Twins.

636
01:43:55,050 --> 01:44:14,039
Let's go. Go to Ember Twin. This is pretty cool. This is really cool, actually. So, alright. I'm

637
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:17,960
starting to understand. So you're on this, you just have these little things, these missions you have

638
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:30,340
to do to try to unravel the mystery of the Nomai. That's pretty cool. And you go quest to quest to

639
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:34,739
quest to quest to quest to quest to quest and you trail to trail to trail to trail to trail.

640
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:44,699
That's pretty fun. Error, error. Alright. How did you... Why is that emote bigger than every other

641
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:58,659
emote? What the hell is that? That emote is three times bigger than all emotes. Alright,

642
01:44:58,659 --> 01:45:10,340
we need Ember Twin. This is slowing down, right? Slow down. That's the one. Slow down. Slow down.

643
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:26,789
It's going too fast. There we go. Slow down. So in the equator of this planet, right in the middle

644
01:45:26,789 --> 01:45:35,180
there's like a core in this one. Alright, go right into like into like the middle of the cookie.

645
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:39,050
Wait, no, don't. I gotta land like on this thing. This thing is spinning very fast.

646
01:45:39,689 --> 01:45:47,819
How am I gonna land on this planet? It's going so fast. Jesus, how am I supposed to do this?

647
01:45:48,699 --> 01:46:01,420
OK, I'm good. Unbuckle. Let's go. Alright, we're good. Flashlight on. Now it's the question of

648
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:11,659
getting into the equator and finding the high energy lab. Is this the equator? There's the

649
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:33,800
lab. The lab's like right in there. But what's this? Wait, maybe is this the lab?

650
01:46:34,899 --> 01:46:55,930
This could be a lab. What the fuck is this? Uh, alright. Fire. Now. Oh shit. Alright,

651
01:46:55,930 --> 01:47:03,350
there's oxygen in here? Hold Patch Suit Puncture. What do you mean Suit Puncture?

652
01:47:04,789 --> 01:47:13,500
Alright, well we got something. There's a lot of shit over here. Activate the Gravity Cannon.

653
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:18,460
That is, that is a Gravity Cannon. OK. I was making a stupid joke.

654
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:35,050
Call the shuttle home. The shuttle is currently resting at the comet. The Sunless City.

655
01:47:37,479 --> 01:48:02,390
How do I move this? Can I move this or something? Is it like a punch or a tool I can use? OK,

656
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:16,710
that's what that is. I can't get in there. I'm gonna go down. Walk into the spikes.

657
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:35,989
Imagine my shock when there's a hole in the suit. Anything in here? Oh, that's too far away.

658
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:50,149
Nothing else here, huh? Wait. OK. Now I think that's it. Yeah, that's it. Can I do anything

659
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:57,579
with that? Oh yeah, I can. Yep. Oh yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

660
01:48:58,539 --> 01:49:32,710
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. What does it do? What does it do? What's going on?

661
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:47,060
Gravity Cannon. Gravity Cannon? I don't know what I just did. What is this one?

662
01:49:51,369 --> 01:49:58,789
I think I just sucked something through. What is that? What did I just do? I just sucked something

663
01:49:58,789 --> 01:50:18,229
in? All right, put this away. Wait, I can go in this. What is this? This is like somebody's ship.

664
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:28,470
This is not the ship. Can I fly it? I fear our situation may be dire.

665
01:50:54,619 --> 01:50:57,100
No, they haven't contacted me since descending below the surface either.

666
01:50:57,899 --> 01:51:02,979
Can I leave the shuttle to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but are they running?

667
01:51:03,779 --> 01:51:09,609
I don't know what I'll do if they aren't well.

668
01:51:11,779 --> 01:51:24,140
Okie pie, come back to me safely, my friends. All right, so what does this do?

669
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:39,210
How do I stop this? How do I stop this? How do I stop this? How do I stop the ride? How do I stop

670
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:46,729
the ride? How do I stop the ride? No, no, no, no. Go over here. Go in the middle. What? Hi.

671
01:51:47,689 --> 01:52:08,460
Where the fuck am I? What does this one do? This is the same place that brings me back to the...

672
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:22,569
Hold on. This doesn't do anything. What about middle again? What does this do? Go out and then

673
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:45,899
What is this taking me? That's just launch, but then I just float around.

674
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:52,300
What about if I do that one? Ok, so what if I hit the right one? Where we go now?

675
01:52:53,260 --> 01:53:04,439
I don't think I'm... I don't know. I don't know.

676
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:21,180
Ok, I'm gonna go back. Is there more readings? All right, got some info though. All right.

677
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:37,880
Quick while the streamer isn't looking, put knives out spoilers in chat. What are you talking about?

678
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:48,949
You can't even talk. You can't even talk, man. All right, so I got some info. I'm gonna go back to my...

679
01:53:50,069 --> 01:53:58,279
This is not the lab though. Quick unmod that guy. Yeah, he's a real nuisance, isn't he?

680
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:07,859
All right, I gotta get out. Don't touch those. What's the best way to get out of here?

681
01:54:15,619 --> 01:54:25,050
Ok, that's not the lab though. It's like in here or something. All right, let's go in here.

682
01:54:26,010 --> 01:54:42,069
Is it gonna kill me? Mods think they are funny. This is turning so fast. It's hurting my body.

683
01:54:42,949 --> 01:54:46,090
All right, what about up there? It said there was a lab in the equator.

684
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:56,729
So I'm just gonna skim the equator and see if I can find it. That looks like a lab.

685
01:54:56,729 --> 01:55:01,100
That looks like it could be a lab. And there's sounds coming from somewhere in here.

686
01:55:01,979 --> 01:55:19,140
All right, here we go. Did I find it? There's something down here. Whoa, it's another one of

687
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:28,060
these things. It's a cave shard. Wait, where'd it go? Hey, where is it? It's gone. Oh, it's one of

688
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:39,500
those shard things. Where'd it go? You have to keep looking at it. It's like SCP. What should I do

689
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:46,140
with it? All right, I gotta read this. Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to

690
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:49,739
tell me he vanished without a trace during our research trip and has been missing ever since.

691
01:55:53,909 --> 01:55:59,109
Mulare, some of us from the Sunless City are here to help search for Coleus. Can you tell us more

692
01:55:59,109 --> 01:56:05,609
about your expedition? Get my gratitude, Burr. Coleus and I were studying the cave's geology.

693
01:56:05,609 --> 01:56:09,770
We hope to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the

694
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:15,909
area. Where was young Coleus lost, please? He disappeared in the cave at the bottom of the

695
01:56:15,909 --> 01:56:23,210
dry lakebed of the North Pole, and it happened in an instant without warning. I turned away from

696
01:56:23,210 --> 01:56:26,890
Coleus to examine a sample. When I turned back, he simply wasn't there anymore. Well, he had one in

697
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:32,489
his pocket. He had a limited supply of air. I'm afraid for him. Yeah, he had one of those rocks

698
01:56:32,489 --> 01:56:40,090
in his pocket. Hypothesis, we will learn more by examining the northern lakebed cave, but Coleus

699
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:51,500
disappeared. Search quickly, everyone. We have no time. All right, I'm out of control. What's going

700
01:56:51,500 --> 01:57:05,529
on? All right, so there's a cave. I'm gonna like, I'm gonna go to, there's a lot of shithair. Okay,

701
01:57:05,529 --> 01:57:25,989
let's go to, wait, what's up here? This is where I came in. I can go up. All right, I don't want

702
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:31,750
to run out of oxygen. What is up here? There was a sound in here that wasn't that, though. What was

703
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:45,109
it? No, that is the cave. Wait, another one. There's like two or three cave shards in here,

704
01:57:45,109 --> 01:57:58,340
they said, right? What the fuck is that? Okay, well, we're going there. We're just gonna go

705
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:19,979
over there. All right, there's a signal. All right, somebody up here? Three detected. All right,

706
01:58:19,979 --> 01:58:48,729
there is somebody here. This is a Cadbury egg. Oh, wait, let's talk. Shurt. Oh, it's you. I take it

707
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:53,369
your first launch went well then. Welcome to the Hourglass Twins. Mine the sand now. What are you

708
01:58:53,369 --> 01:58:58,170
doing? Hornfell has noticed our star charts are out of date, so I came here to update them, but

709
01:58:58,170 --> 01:59:05,930
something seems off. I've seen what? 10 supernova by now. 12? They're in double digits now, and

710
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:16,260
that's, you know, not normal. Not normal at all. He's seeing the supernovas. I found something.

711
01:59:16,899 --> 01:59:20,619
Why are somebody's stars supernova? What are you doing out here? Where should I explore? How

712
01:59:20,619 --> 01:59:28,090
dangerous is that big column of falling sand? I found something. Actually, never mind. Please do

713
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:32,859
tell. What? Nothing you'd like to discuss at the moment. That's no trouble. If you do find something

714
01:59:32,859 --> 01:59:41,449
you wish to discuss, please come find me. I'll be here studying the stars for a while. Why are

715
01:59:41,449 --> 01:59:46,520
so many stars going supernova? I have no idea. Massive stars go supernova when they reach the

716
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:50,439
end of their lifespan. It's probably that the stars are older than we realized, or maybe our

717
01:59:50,439 --> 01:59:55,460
models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected. Honestly, I'm not fond of either option.

718
01:59:55,460 --> 02:00:00,899
If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun. No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I'm

719
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:10,090
probably overlooking something. That's it. I just need to collect more data. How dangerous is that

720
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:14,970
column of falling sand? On a scale of one to dead, I'd give it a seven or an eight. Awfully pretty,

721
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:20,329
though. Right now, sand is flowing from ash twin to ember twin. But did you know the process

722
02:00:20,329 --> 02:00:25,050
eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the twins,

723
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:29,479
but it seems to be a natural phenomenon. Oh, if you'd like to see something interesting,

724
02:00:29,479 --> 02:00:34,119
check out the other twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won't be

725
02:00:34,119 --> 02:00:49,029
disappointed. Is there anything else? Where should I go? Be honest, I haven't left this lake bed. I

726
02:00:49,029 --> 02:00:53,350
don't mean to brag, but I'm really quite good with the little scout. I've been taking pictures of

727
02:00:53,350 --> 02:01:00,180
everything from right here in my campsite. Let us free. I want to use the German auto emote.

728
02:01:02,069 --> 02:01:06,229
All right, let them free. Let them free. Let them free. Let them free. They've they've they've

729
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:14,380
behaved. Let them free. To be honest, I haven't left this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you seen the

730
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:18,859
old shipwreck site on the ember twin's southern hemisphere? The one shooting a bright beam of

731
02:01:18,859 --> 02:01:23,979
light into the sky? It's not one of our own crashes. Surprisingly enough, this is a Nomai ship.

732
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:31,699
What ship? You find ruins across the twins, but strangely not a single settlement. Believe me,

733
02:01:31,699 --> 02:01:37,220
if there was one to see, I'd have it seen with my little scout. But they live not on the surface,

734
02:01:37,220 --> 02:01:40,340
clearly. The ember twin is full of cave systems. Maybe the answer lies underground.

735
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:50,329
All right. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What is that? What is

736
02:01:50,329 --> 02:02:08,680
that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? It's a bunch of floating trash.

737
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:13,159
What do I do about that? All right, hold on. What's this? God damn it. What's this? What's that? What's

738
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:30,600
this? I need that stone. I need that stone thing. Can I touch this? What if I go in the middle and

739
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:46,949
like look up? Um, I don't know what that... We're getting close to the sun. That's too close. That's

740
02:02:46,949 --> 02:02:53,340
way too close. Who built this? You can already touch the sun right now. How am I not dead? Look

741
02:02:53,340 --> 02:03:03,899
at how close that is. That's so close. Oh my God. It's going to touch. It's going to scrape. It's

742
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:26,819
going to scrape. It's going to scrape. Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do that. Don't do that.

743
02:03:26,819 --> 02:03:31,140
That's stupid. It said that when the sand's done... Look. What the fuck happened to my body? What's

744
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:45,050
going on? What? Did somebody throw something at me? Did somebody shoot me? What happened?

745
02:03:45,050 --> 02:04:00,539
Well, I found the egg guy. He jumped 200 meters into the air. This is ADHD. ADHD problems for me.

746
02:04:04,779 --> 02:04:07,899
I want something to look at and there's something to look at and there's something to look at at

747
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:17,449
the same time. And I'm just falling off a cliff. Okay. Um, I have new info though.

748
02:04:18,819 --> 02:04:26,840
This game is nothing but things to look at. I know. That's why I'm going to have a big problem

749
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:34,739
with this game because there's too many things to look at. All right. What did I do? I got some new

750
02:04:34,739 --> 02:04:51,340
info. So many info. So many info. So many new things. That's too many things. I've got,

751
02:04:51,899 --> 02:04:57,109
there's too many DNA strands here. I'm going to go back to this because this is,

752
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:07,130
there's too much going on over here right now. Real Hollows South Pole. There's a door to the

753
02:05:07,130 --> 02:05:11,210
observatory on the surface, but it's broken. And I can remember I could, I could get in there somehow.

754
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:25,319
I got to finish one of these. I got to complete one of these.

755
02:05:26,119 --> 02:05:29,510
Harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth. Okay, wait.

756
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:43,420
That's this planet. That's where I am right now. Right. Hold on. Who the fuck is that?

757
02:05:44,300 --> 02:06:46,500
Who's doing that? Where is that? I want to get back up to my ship. Where's the, where's the,

758
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:52,409
of course it has to be all the way up there. Is there, can I fly up there with fuel or is it,

759
02:06:52,569 --> 02:07:05,979
can I only do like a big jump? I don't know. I can. How do I do it? I'm holding right trigger.

760
02:07:06,939 --> 02:07:24,550
How do I do that? I'll just stay on this planet and go find this harmonica.

761
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:52,680
Let's go around here. Where is this harmonica? It's going to land right there. The world is

762
02:07:52,680 --> 02:08:12,710
your oyster, Jeremiah. Yeah. Let's find this harmonica. Okay. You're in here. Don't fall.

763
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:42,170
Float. Okay. What the fuck is this? Um, okay. You, do you have a harmonica?

764
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:57,670
This thing's playing the harmonica. How? Hey, Hatchling. I thought you were taking that tin

765
02:08:57,670 --> 02:09:02,710
can of yours into space today. What are you still doing here? Me? I saw something crash over the

766
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:07,189
horizon and didn't like what I was seeing in the pictures of my little scout was sending back.

767
02:09:07,189 --> 02:09:13,319
But I come over here myself and take a look. What is it? I don't know what it is. It looks

768
02:09:13,319 --> 02:09:17,479
like some kind of plant seed, but it's not anything I've seen on timber or hearth before.

769
02:09:17,479 --> 02:09:22,710
And trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day. I think it's extraterrestrial. It kind

770
02:09:22,710 --> 02:09:26,470
of looks like something that might've come off dark ramble. Whatever it is, it put down its roots in

771
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:32,699
a hurry. I don't like the look of this thing, Hatchling. And that's a fact. I think I'll set

772
02:09:32,699 --> 02:09:37,180
marlin haul loose on it. Let's get rid of this mess sooner rather than later. And no one can

773
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:41,020
remove an unwanted plant faster than a treekeeper can. I'll have to get a look at what's inside the

774
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:45,739
seed first though. I don't want to set anybody up hacking a potentially dangerous plant without

775
02:09:45,739 --> 02:09:51,989
a better idea of what's lurking inside of it. Huff can help me haul the old scout launcher over here.

776
02:09:52,789 --> 02:09:57,270
Obviously the opening is too small for someone to fit inside. And anyway, I'm not going to

777
02:09:57,270 --> 02:10:01,510
politely stick my hands in anything that looks as unpleasant as that. That's a good way to lose an

778
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:35,340
arm. I got one of those. Doing a colonoscopy. What's that? Wait, what is that? What is that?

779
02:10:35,340 --> 02:11:02,810
What is that? Go find out. I can't go in there. Help. Help. Help me. No, no, no. Stop. Get off.

780
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:07,420
Get off. Get off. Get off. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay. Am I going to die? I threw a little scout into

781
02:11:07,420 --> 02:11:11,979
the seed. You did, did you? And you're telling me it's bigger on the inside than on the outside.

782
02:11:14,329 --> 02:11:17,829
Could be a chore to chop up and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn't have

783
02:11:17,829 --> 02:11:22,630
the decency to stay the same size? Maybe I better grab an extra ax or three.

784
02:11:23,590 --> 02:11:30,979
See, he did a lot of damage when it crashed. I like this crater.

785
02:11:31,699 --> 02:11:36,710
My signal scope is picking up a harmonica inside. I don't know what to tell you. The

786
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:41,350
only harmonica player I know is Feldspar and they disappeared ages ago. Listener, don't go telling

787
02:11:41,989 --> 02:11:45,829
Nace about the harmonica music, okay? They'll never let me get rid of this darn seed they

788
02:11:45,829 --> 02:11:55,300
suspect it has musical talent. You sure this seed isn't from Timber Hearth? Back in my younger days,

789
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:59,699
I explored everywhere there is to go on Timber Hearth and saw everything there is to see and

790
02:11:59,699 --> 02:12:03,939
then some. Trust me, we don't have anything like this. I reckon this thing's from Dark Bramble.

791
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:31,579
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

792
02:12:33,239 --> 02:12:45,420
Wait a minute. There's a fire there. There's a campfire there. Wait a minute. Wait, wait,

793
02:12:45,420 --> 02:13:10,300
wait a minute. Error. Duplicate signal. All right, keep that camera on. We're going for it,

794
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:21,319
boys and girls. I could only fucking learn how to drive my body ship. I just want to see,

795
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:28,840
I just want to see. Oh shit. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I know what that is.

796
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:37,689
I know what that is. That's where it is. Oh damn. All right, we're going to go. Okay,

797
02:13:37,689 --> 02:13:42,409
we're going to find that. Keep the camera up. Keep the camera up. Don't put the camera down.

798
02:13:43,130 --> 02:14:02,899
Oh, you put the camera down, you idiot. Wait, it's still on there.

799
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:10,550
Fly the fucking ship, Jeremy. Oh wait, let me just turn my head and look around while I drive.

800
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:26,140
Duplicate signal. Let's go. There it is. I'm going to find that guy. We're going to find that guy.

801
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:34,090
That guy's here. Feldspar is here. He's not lost. He's playing the harmonica in a time portal.

802
02:14:34,729 --> 02:15:01,770
Duplicate signal. All right, I got to be careful. Is this on the dark bramble? I don't have,

803
02:15:01,770 --> 02:15:09,270
I don't have the thing to help. It's just too fast. Am I going too fast? Too fast. Too fast.

804
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:27,640
Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. Too fast. Pull up. All right. I'm going to land on

805
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:40,460
this thing. Can I just fly in there? I don't think I can land on this. I can't land on this.

806
02:15:41,020 --> 02:16:15,260
Once I get close enough, I'm going to stop. Shit. Okay. Okay, hold on. Here we go. I'm just going to

807
02:16:15,260 --> 02:17:09,719
dump in there. Oh, oh, oh. Where the fuck am I? I'm coming. I'm coming. I'll be there in a minute.

808
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:25,500
I'm coming. I'm coming to rescue you. I'm almost out of fuel. He's in there. All right. Slow down.

809
02:17:26,059 --> 02:17:46,659
Get in here. All right. What is this? Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Error. Duplicate

810
02:17:46,659 --> 02:18:03,239
signal. Error. Fuel level critical. What the hell is going on? 1.3 kilometers. 500 meters.

811
02:18:10,069 --> 02:18:26,309
300. 400. Wait, there's another smaller one? Duplicate signals. Right there. All right. Land

812
02:18:26,309 --> 02:18:35,110
on it. Get it. All right. What is it? Grab it. Stick a knife in it. Stick a knife in it.

813
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:43,450
Stick a knife in this thing. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Wait, give me my...

814
02:18:47,000 --> 02:19:22,459
Shoot it. What do I do with this thing? No, stop, stop, stop. Go down, down, down. What do I do with

815
02:19:22,459 --> 02:19:35,030
this? I don't know what to do with this. Shoot it in? I'm going to shoot it in. Oh, no. Wait, now

816
02:19:35,030 --> 02:20:04,620
where is this going? Where is this going now? What the hell is this? What? I'm... 60 seconds

817
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:24,420
until oxygen is gone. What? But I'm not ready. I'm not done yet. I'm not ready. Am I in somebody's

818
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:37,350
brain? Is this like neurons or something? I'm dead. Could I have flown the ship in here?

819
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:51,799
I didn't know that. I don't know what to do about that. Do I have any new info?

820
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:14,090
What is that? That happens every time. What is that? What's going on over here?

821
02:21:14,889 --> 02:21:26,840
This shit explodes every time I wake up. Why? What is that? I'm going back there. Wait,

822
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:32,700
I need to... I'm going back there. No, I need to shoot it in the thing. No, what do I do? I don't

823
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:53,719
know. Grab the ship. Did I get any new info? No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I get any info?

824
02:21:55,100 --> 02:22:02,840
Dead. Dark bramble seed inside the seed. When I launch my scout into the seed that crashed on

825
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:08,680
Timberheart, it ends up somewhere in dark bramble. The seed from dark bramble crashed here and has

826
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:20,059
taken root. I'm going for it. Okay, I'm going to do that again and then I'm going to take the ship

827
02:22:20,059 --> 02:22:25,540
in there this time and I'm going to continue my investigation. Right? Yeah, that was good to me.

828
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:28,600
Let's go to the bramble again.

829
02:22:41,959 --> 02:23:07,430
I'm rushing. I'm rushing. I'm rushing. Wait, what's this? Where's the... Where's the

830
02:23:07,909 --> 02:23:15,780
thing? Wait, I'm like rushing. I'm too... I'm too overexcited. What? Wait, what the hell is it

831
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:21,899
talking about? Why is that 15 million meters away? I'm dying. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

832
02:23:22,620 --> 02:23:48,459
I'm not. I'm fine. Shoot it back in here. Okay, there it goes. Wasn't there... It looks like a

833
02:23:48,459 --> 02:24:09,239
campfire there though. That's what I don't understand. Right here. See? Was this a campfire?

834
02:24:09,799 --> 02:24:29,430
Okay, well, I know what that is. Let's go. I'll get it. I'll figure it out.

835
02:24:32,170 --> 02:24:41,739
Get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Don't worry. I'll get it eventually. Don't worry. I'll get it

836
02:24:41,739 --> 02:25:00,409
eventually. I'll get it. Don't worry. I will get it eventually. Play Hulk. This game sucks.

837
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:11,780
I don't own a Hulk for the Wii. How many times do I have to say that? I don't own the Hulk.

838
02:25:12,500 --> 02:26:08,500
What is this? Is that my ship? No. What's going on? It's because it was damaged. Would it explode?

839
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:49,059
So what do I do? How do I do? You have to... I'm softlocked? Oh. Fly into the sun. Well,

840
02:26:49,059 --> 02:26:55,350
I guess I could. Wait. This is gonna like... Wait. What's down here? Secret! Is there a secret in

841
02:26:55,350 --> 02:27:16,459
here? I'll do it again. I just was... I was too excited and I just rushed. I was so excited to

842
02:27:16,459 --> 02:27:22,219
run down there and shoot my thing. Do I need to shoot that thing though? I probably do. Do I? No,

843
02:27:22,219 --> 02:27:27,979
I don't. I know where it is. No, I just... I can just go there, right? Do I need to shoot it in there?

844
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:35,139
I don't think I have to do that. Maybe I do. All right. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'll shoot it in.

845
02:27:35,139 --> 02:27:41,860
I'm gonna be careful. I know where it is now. Yeah, I know where it is, but I can't track down my

846
02:27:43,700 --> 02:28:35,620
beam thing. Like my launcher. I'm gonna shoot it through and then try this again.

847
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:46,809
Where was that? Where was that thing? It's over here, right? There we go. Fire it. Boink. There it

848
02:28:46,809 --> 02:29:24,819
goes. Get the pictures. Just so I can know what I'm looking for. There it is. There it is. Okay.

849
02:29:24,819 --> 02:29:35,420
Found it. Good. Let's go. Don't retrieve the thing. Look at the signal. All right. Let's move

850
02:29:35,420 --> 02:29:51,100
back over to this ship. Why is my ship over there? Wait. What happened to my ship?

851
02:29:52,059 --> 02:30:19,139
Where's my ship? Oh, okay. Right, right, right. There it is. I got confused there for a second.

852
02:30:20,979 --> 02:30:27,420
I forgot. Mario Galaxy mechanics. Could be underneath you, but it's not. It's above you.

853
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:35,530
All right. Now I'm ready. I'm going to go in there with the ship this time. I'm going to be very

854
02:30:35,530 --> 02:30:45,989
careful. I'm going to go for it. Let's move. I'm wicked fucking excited right now. I'm going to

855
02:30:45,989 --> 02:31:20,409
go fast quick. Slow down. Seven. Six. Five. Slower. Slower. Slower. Okay. We're good. Can I get in

856
02:31:20,409 --> 02:31:26,360
here with this ship? It's going to be impossible. I'm not going to be able to get it in here.

857
02:31:27,079 --> 02:31:37,430
How the fuck am I going to do this? Look at how small this is. This thing's going to explode.

858
02:31:37,989 --> 02:32:46,940
The ship's going to explode when I do this. I lost the signal. What's the red thing? All right.

859
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:56,500
Hold on. Almost there. Do I fly in here? Can I make it in there too? I don't think I could make

860
02:32:56,500 --> 02:33:14,760
it in here. Oh my God. How am I going to get in there? Slowly. What? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

861
02:33:20,620 --> 02:33:57,290
What was that? What? What is that thing? Put your left earphone in.

862
02:33:57,850 --> 02:34:49,559
All right. So I got to go faster than that. You have an instafilter on. I do not have an

863
02:34:49,559 --> 02:35:01,799
instafilter on. Now you're making me excited. I'm just going to land the ship in there.

864
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:05,719
Why have I not done that yet? Why have I not just landed the ship here?

865
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:17,930
Right? Like what the hell am I doing? I can't kill this guy, right?

866
02:35:18,969 --> 02:35:55,989
Okay. So there's a giant enemy fish in here. I have to go quicker. I have to go through it faster.

867
02:35:57,190 --> 02:36:05,479
I don't have any guns. I do not have any weapons. I don't have any guns or anything.

868
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:25,690
That's a little too fast. Way too fast. What? Excuse me. Okay. That doesn't get up. No, no,

869
02:36:25,690 --> 02:36:31,450
no, no. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Unbuckle. Okay. We're good. We're fine. God damn it. Come

870
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:58,780
on. I had somebody fire like a missile at me. There was like an asteroid and it freaked me out.

871
02:36:59,340 --> 02:37:04,969
Just take off your helmet. I don't think I can. That was a quick one too.

872
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:08,889
Whatever. I'm just doing this. Flying in the fucking sun. Who cares?

873
02:37:27,299 --> 02:37:32,860
I was going too fast because I was too fightable and then the meteor tried to hit me and it freaked

874
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:46,379
me out and I crashed to fuck. Can I just die already? Can I please die? Why can't I just

875
02:37:46,379 --> 02:38:28,340
rip my helmet off and have my head explode? Why can't I burn as much fuel as possible?

876
02:38:28,340 --> 02:38:55,239
Did I have to leave the ship? The ship was spinning around and it was giving me progress.

877
02:38:56,040 --> 02:39:06,280
Yeah, we are making progress. I wonder if I can float in there. Can't wait to watch the replay

878
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:22,600
of this one. It's gonna be real exciting. Three minutes until oxygen depletes. What was that?

879
02:39:23,319 --> 02:39:29,000
Oh, that's where I was trying to go. 60 seconds. Five, four, three, two.

880
02:39:32,739 --> 02:39:40,969
That's just the noise that I make right when I'm about to do the Bane impression into a coffee mug.

881
02:39:52,790 --> 02:40:01,030
Exciting. Good run. Good. We did it. Oh, look. There he goes again.

882
02:40:03,450 --> 02:40:10,329
My soul leaving my body and I don't know, whatever that is. Don't fuck it up this time.

883
02:40:10,969 --> 02:41:15,559
This time I gotta get away from the giant fish. Same deal. I'm just a guy. I don't have my equipment.

884
02:41:25,030 --> 02:41:55,719
Let's go. Okay. Don't fuck it up this time. Accelerating toward destination.

885
02:41:56,520 --> 02:42:12,840
Autopilot's cheating. Well, Fortnite, Jimmy. Let me tell you. You have to let Luigi help you

886
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:24,629
sometimes. This will be the fourth time I've tried to come over here. Hey! It almost happened again.

887
02:42:25,989 --> 02:42:50,069
God damn it. How fast do I have to do this? Do I have to go really fast to get away from the

888
02:42:51,030 --> 02:43:02,299
giant fish? I'm scared. All right. Here we go. I gotta get in there quickly. Put your earbuds in.

889
02:43:02,299 --> 02:43:41,690
All right. Your second earbud going in. All right. Now where? Oh, fuck. I'm fine. Where am I?

890
02:43:41,690 --> 02:44:19,500
Straight ahead. I'm going down here. I made it. I'm in. I'm in. Shit's getting louder. Wait.

891
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:25,340
It's this thing's mouth. It's in this thing's actual mouth. It's inside of this thing's mouth.

892
02:44:25,979 --> 02:44:57,319
Do I go in it? Do I get out? There is a fire over there. I told you there was a fire.

893
02:44:57,319 --> 02:45:01,379
I told you there was a fire. I told you there was a fire. I told you.

894
02:45:03,129 --> 02:45:09,319
I fucking told you there was a fire. Nobody believed me. Found you.

895
02:45:10,579 --> 02:45:22,149
Elsewhere. Oh shit. There goes the ship. Can I, can I, what?

896
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:32,659
The ship. Oh my God. I want the ship to land. I need the ship to land.

897
02:45:33,299 --> 02:45:48,059
Come look. All right. Help. Help. I found you. Relax. Relax. Relax. Hey. Whoa. Where'd you come

898
02:45:48,059 --> 02:45:53,739
from? No one's coming here. And then. Actually, that makes you the second

899
02:45:53,739 --> 02:45:56,620
Parthian to ever reach dark ramble. After me, of course. Well done.

900
02:45:58,459 --> 02:46:02,139
Say it's you. They made you an astronaut and you haven't blown yourself up yet. Good for you.

901
02:46:02,139 --> 02:46:10,329
You're alive. You never were the brightest hatchling, were you? Yeah, that's right. I'm

902
02:46:10,329 --> 02:46:14,649
alive. Been camping out here since my ship, you know, crashed violently.

903
02:46:15,690 --> 02:46:19,290
Crashed? But you're a good pilot. It's going to pass me aggressive.

904
02:46:20,170 --> 02:46:23,770
I haven't lived in polite society for a while, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume that

905
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:30,469
wasn't sarcasm. My story goes like this. I just finished exploring the core of Giants Deep,

906
02:46:30,469 --> 02:46:33,909
and I wanted to try my hand at dark ramble, seeing as no one had ever been here before.

907
02:46:34,870 --> 02:46:39,670
Getting around a dark ramble was easy, mind you. Once you've dodged one massive interdimensional

908
02:46:39,670 --> 02:46:48,819
vine bristling with thorns, you've dodged them all. But after a while, I run into this huge angler

909
02:46:48,819 --> 02:46:54,739
fish. You've seen them. Big gnarly things. And this was the biggest one I've seen yet. Ever.

910
02:46:55,540 --> 02:47:00,100
I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off. Nothing too fancy. I'm going full speed when the

911
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:06,819
fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and, well, like I said, I crash. Blammo. On impact, my ship

912
02:47:06,819 --> 02:47:11,459
starts making noises, like it's coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain't great.

913
02:47:11,459 --> 02:47:16,260
Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical system starts sparkling like crazy.

914
02:47:17,059 --> 02:47:21,059
It's either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and

915
02:47:21,059 --> 02:47:28,100
my poor friend ship. I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later.

916
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:32,819
Great find. Would have been stupid not to use it. If I moved my setup over here,

917
02:47:33,620 --> 02:47:42,409
planted my emergency tree seeds, been here ever since. Wow. Yeah, pretty much. Anyway,

918
02:47:42,409 --> 02:47:46,409
that's how it all went down, hatchlings. Story's over, but I feel free to stay and enjoy the fire

919
02:47:46,409 --> 02:47:55,059
a while. But don't. Fire's not going anywhere. Anything else you wanted? Uh, shouldn't I tell

920
02:47:55,059 --> 02:48:00,680
ground control to come get you? Well, yeah, sure, whenever you have time. Frankly, I kind of like it

921
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:05,319
out here. Quiet, peaceful. You're a little young to understand. There's a lot of pressure being the

922
02:48:05,319 --> 02:48:16,090
best that ever was. It's been nice to have a break. Well, I don't think we're going to get out of

923
02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:40,250
here, Feldspar. What else is in here? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, okay. Okay, come here. Okay, I found

924
02:48:40,250 --> 02:48:46,569
something. Lay it on me. I found a dark bramble seed on Timber Hearth. That's bad business,

925
02:48:46,569 --> 02:48:51,450
hatchling. This turret will tell you if you sow as much glance in dark bramble's direction. There

926
02:48:51,450 --> 02:48:58,280
used to be a fifth planet where the bramble is now. It was an infernal planet. The infernal plant

927
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:02,040
appeared at the center and kept growing and growing and growing until it shattered the planet and

928
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:08,760
shattered, scattered its pieces across space. If we don't get that seed you found sorted real quick,

929
02:49:09,479 --> 02:49:14,040
I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what,

930
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:21,079
we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless seed. Unidentified signal

931
02:49:21,079 --> 02:49:44,180
nearby. How's that unknown? I know what this is. Yeah, it's mine. Unknown. No, it's Feldspar. Yeah,

932
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:54,620
I know what that is now. What are you talking about? Okay, what else? Where should I explore

933
02:49:54,620 --> 02:50:00,219
here? That spirit anywhere is good, but you should know that space is weird here intensely.

934
02:50:00,219 --> 02:50:04,620
Ever tried throwing your probe into one of these weird seeds? See there with the little opening,

935
02:50:04,620 --> 02:50:09,899
it's just big enough to launch one through. Probe tracker will tell you the probe is in

936
02:50:09,899 --> 02:50:15,739
two places at once. But I don't think that's wrong exactly because space doesn't work right in here.

937
02:50:16,379 --> 02:50:22,579
That seed looks small, see, but inside it's bigger. Much bigger. I had a lot of time to think about

938
02:50:22,579 --> 02:50:28,899
this. My theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That's why

939
02:50:28,899 --> 02:50:34,200
it's bigger inside those seeds. Well, that's my theory. Keep that in mind while you're exploring

940
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:43,260
Dark Bramble and maybe you won't get lost inside forever. Good luck. You've reached the core of

941
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:47,940
Giant Steve. How'd you do that? Oh, that was a wild one. Since you're asking, I got to assume

942
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:52,340
you haven't made it down to yourself yet, right? I tell you how it kind of feels like cheating.

943
02:50:54,100 --> 02:50:59,780
On a completely unrelated note, that sure was a big hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep.

944
02:51:00,979 --> 02:51:05,219
If I were you, I'd go take a walk and see where it ends. You want to go

945
02:51:05,219 --> 02:51:09,940
to the tail end of the angler fish skeleton here and look for flickering light in the fog.

946
02:51:10,899 --> 02:51:24,329
That'll be my old ship. That starts there. Put this guy on emote only mode. What happened to the

947
02:51:24,329 --> 02:51:30,489
angler fish here? Oh, the skeleton. It was like this when I got here, as near as I can tell.

948
02:51:30,489 --> 02:51:35,129
This angler fish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten the seed. And then the seed grew

949
02:51:35,129 --> 02:51:41,940
and grew in the poor fish's stomach until this happened. Gross. The skeleton was a good find.

950
02:51:41,940 --> 02:51:46,420
The light keeps the fish away, you know. See, they're territorial. So they're mostly avoiding

951
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:56,250
each other. That's why I set up camp here. Oh, I want you to look at that. All right. Let's

952
02:51:57,290 --> 02:52:01,129
go do what he wanted. We got more info. All right, let's go find it. Go to the tail end.

953
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:31,739
Wait, should I try to get the ship back? I should probably do this on the ship. The ship. Ship. Okay,

954
02:52:31,739 --> 02:52:50,340
good. All right, he said go down into the tail. Where the hell is he? He's over here. Go over to

955
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:58,819
the tail. And he said it's your journey begins there. All right, give me the scalp back. I don't

956
02:52:58,819 --> 02:53:06,979
need it anymore. Your journey begins here. With that flickering light? That's where your journey

957
02:53:06,979 --> 02:53:30,360
begins. Should I do anything? What about his ship? Did I do anything about his ship? All right,

958
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:57,639
I did it. Come in. Easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot.

959
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:12,340
Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. What? The ship doesn't fit in there. Wait. Did I go the wrong

960
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:31,989
way? Easy. Don't break anything. No, I didn't go the wrong way. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry that

961
02:54:31,989 --> 02:54:44,059
I'm increasing. I'm increasing your puke meters by like 500% right now. Okay. All right. I'm just

962
02:54:44,059 --> 02:55:16,659
gonna get out. Oh, man. We're going down the drain. Gravity? Duplicate signal. Another one?

963
02:55:16,659 --> 02:55:48,629
What the hell am I? Launching fluctuation. All right. Where am I? Where am I? What is that?

964
02:55:49,350 --> 02:55:57,750
Oh, we've got some info. Hold on. Trip four entry. I'm gonna say not one. Crash is three. Boring

965
02:55:57,750 --> 02:56:03,350
crash is zero. Whoa. Never thought I'd see one of these beasties outside of the giant's deep. They

966
02:56:03,350 --> 02:56:09,270
were awfully useful back there. Maybe a jellyfish could be useful here too. Blur. This thing tastes

967
02:56:09,270 --> 02:56:13,750
terrible. The outside's all rubbery and tough. Maybe that's because it insulates the jellyfish's

968
02:56:13,750 --> 02:56:20,040
insides from getting zapped by electricity. Right. I'm going inside of this jellyfish's

969
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:53,299
interior cavity. See if what's in there tastes any better. To do that. To feldspar. Do not eat

970
02:56:53,299 --> 02:56:58,340
this even if you are dying. It would be too sad if this is the last thing you ever ate in this life.

971
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:03,620
I guess these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity. Again, do not eat.

972
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:19,989
All right. Watch the fuel. My O2 is going down too. All right. Let's keep going around here.

973
02:57:20,950 --> 02:57:30,059
What else is here? I'm not gonna eat it. He specifically said he specifically made a journal

974
02:57:30,059 --> 02:57:47,719
to say don't eat this. Is that the only thing that's down here? Is that it? That's way too far away.

975
02:57:47,719 --> 02:58:13,159
Any signals? I thought I was over here. There's too many musical instruments being played.

976
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:18,420
This way? Where can I go? Up? Should I go up and out or in or around or I don't know?

977
02:58:19,219 --> 02:58:36,299
What's up here? Is this where I came from? Is there any other way to go?

978
02:58:37,100 --> 02:58:43,500
Doesn't look like it. I don't think there's anywhere else for me to go here.

979
02:58:44,139 --> 02:58:58,409
We just got to see the jellyfish. What about this way? Behind the jellyfish.

980
02:58:59,049 --> 02:59:30,860
Nothing. We'll go back here. All the way to the end. Down here. Kind of. What's down here?

981
02:59:30,860 --> 02:59:43,909
Well, this is beautiful. What's that? I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

982
02:59:44,870 --> 02:59:57,819
I just am a little disoriented. What's in here? I'm gonna go this way. Out there. That's what I want.

983
03:00:03,989 --> 03:00:08,229
Go on one of the ends. Right up here. This is what I want.

984
03:00:09,110 --> 03:00:20,579
Got to be something on here, right? Like on one of the ends. Come on. Nothing? No way. There's

985
03:00:20,579 --> 03:00:48,020
got to be like a note up here. Look. This is like these flat surfaces. How do I go down? How do I

986
03:00:48,020 --> 03:01:06,170
go down? What is this? It's trash? What is this? What the hell is this? It's like an eclipse. What

987
03:01:06,170 --> 03:01:25,510
is this place? Is there oxygen on this? Holy shit. Oh my god. Oh. Oh. Okay. Um. There's no oxygen on

988
03:01:25,510 --> 03:01:40,149
this planet? Turn. Turn. Turn. Turn. Turn. Where's the oxygen? No. No. There's a tree right there. I

989
03:01:40,149 --> 03:01:58,969
can see the tree. What? That's like seriously. I can't. Tree? Right? No. There's a tree right here.

990
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:29,219
Tree. I got a stone. Is there oxygen? No. No. No. I thought there was gonna be one over here

991
03:02:29,219 --> 03:02:48,659
in the corner. Well, I made a lot of progress there. Let's go take a look at the Quest Trapper.

992
03:03:02,870 --> 03:03:27,579
There it is again. Quest. Quest. Quest. Quest. Quest accepted. Quest accepted. Got it. Now.

993
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:31,399
Frozen jellyfish. Uh oh. We've reached the dead end.

994
03:03:58,139 --> 03:04:21,780
Hold on to me. Hey. I hear you're leaving to see adventure. Um. How do I? Didn't, didn't he say tell

995
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:31,479
everybody? Who do I talk to? The guy in the observatory? And that thing, that thing's

996
03:04:31,479 --> 03:04:45,860
gonna consume the planet. I need to tell people about it? You. I got some news. Um. Not you

997
03:04:45,860 --> 03:04:54,469
apparently. Who do I tell this to? Gotta be the guy that help, Helford or something. Whatever his

998
03:04:54,709 --> 03:05:17,670
names, right? All right. I'm going up. Gonna go there from here. I was holding A. Whatever.

999
03:05:19,159 --> 03:05:30,950
Good run. Okay. I'm actually surprised you can die by that. Imagine seeing that. That guy must

1000
03:05:30,950 --> 03:05:37,930
have just watched the most heinous, awful, just person being crushed, squished right next to him.

1001
03:05:37,930 --> 03:05:47,100
That person. Let's go to the observatory. Right over here. I gotta make this jump or I'm gonna be

1002
03:05:47,100 --> 03:06:03,420
really upset. Okay. Unidentified signal. Okay. We gotta talk to um. Somebody in here, right?

1003
03:06:03,420 --> 03:06:23,899
Where is he? Not even here anymore. Where is this guy? Well, there's nobody. I can't. I need to

1004
03:06:23,899 --> 03:06:28,600
tell somebody about the. Maybe I should tell the guy down there? All right. I'm gonna tell the guy

1005
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:41,129
that has the mining axe. All right. Get me the hell out of here. Wait. Hey. That you opened its

1006
03:06:41,129 --> 03:06:45,780
eyes but you wish you'd seen that happen, huh? Sign me too. Not even a little closer to understanding

1007
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:51,780
what's going on with the statue. Was there something that you needed? Yes. I found Feldspar

1008
03:06:51,780 --> 03:06:54,819
and they're in dark bramble stars above. This is wonderful news. Thank you. Thank you for finding

1009
03:06:54,819 --> 03:06:59,139
them. That Feldspar didn't immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar

1010
03:06:59,139 --> 03:07:05,340
of them. Never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then either. So we gotta fish them

1011
03:07:05,340 --> 03:07:09,340
out of that dreadful place with all haste. I'll radio Gosson and have them prepare a ship. It

1012
03:07:09,340 --> 03:07:15,209
really should be Gosson who brings Feldspar home. Thank you. You can hardly imagine how profoundly

1013
03:07:15,209 --> 03:07:24,329
happy I am to hear that they're alive and unharmed. Appearance on hourglass twins.

1014
03:07:24,329 --> 03:07:31,079
Ryback is on brittle hollow and Gabbo is on giant steve. All right. Yeah. But what about the

1015
03:07:31,079 --> 03:07:42,600
thing that's taken over the world? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited. Does nobody care

1016
03:07:42,600 --> 03:08:19,319
about this? All right. I gotta get back. I'm gonna talk to the guy that's looking at me.

1017
03:08:20,120 --> 03:08:27,670
Let me get in there. Eyes itching like crazy right now. I hope I don't die.

1018
03:08:28,389 --> 03:08:41,260
Okay. We're good. I really need to go to the bathroom, but I don't want to stop watching.

1019
03:08:46,440 --> 03:09:10,540
You go to twitch.tv slash germa985 on your phone. What a sellout. Selling up my own stream.

1020
03:09:11,739 --> 03:09:16,950
All right. I gotta go talk to this guy. This is not even. Hold on. What the hell is this?

1021
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:31,260
That looks cool. All right. Where's the, uh, I gotta go in here. Is this, this is not even right.

1022
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:50,180
Where's the, oh, okay. Where's the guy? Where's the dude doing the, where is he?

1023
03:09:51,139 --> 03:10:18,569
Okay. There it is. Jesus. Oh, inside my ears are itching. Ow. All right. You can't, you can't,

1024
03:10:18,569 --> 03:10:32,950
I need somebody like a designated face scratcher to play this game. Hey, listen to me. Is that a

1025
03:10:32,950 --> 03:10:42,360
dark bramble seed? It is. Yes. Don't I have info? Well, fuck this place then. Nobody cares.

1026
03:10:47,979 --> 03:10:53,159
All right. What we got? We have some loose ends. What's, what is this?

1027
03:10:55,129 --> 03:11:00,170
Giants deep. All right. We're going to go to giants deep. I've never been there.

1028
03:11:00,729 --> 03:11:28,809
Giants deep. Oh, there, there's our Vroomie autopilot is freaking out right now. I'm

1029
03:11:28,809 --> 03:11:53,260
not entirely sure why. Okay. We're good. Wait, I have been here. Wasn't this the, this is where

1030
03:11:53,260 --> 03:12:13,450
it just was? It is. Okay. Is there a good place to land this? A little landing pad right here.

1031
03:12:14,889 --> 03:12:40,200
It's convenient. Oh, nice. Oh, get off. All right. The clue was he was here somewhere.

1032
03:12:47,079 --> 03:13:15,340
All right. This place is like super gravity. I'm going to sneeze. Oh, I'm one to, is that a

1033
03:13:15,340 --> 03:13:29,959
jellyfish? Oh, wait, something over here. Oh, it's one of those things. All right. Cool. Let's go.

1034
03:13:29,959 --> 03:13:49,399
How do I swim down? Get out of the water. This is my greatest fear. Can I go in this? What happens

1035
03:13:49,399 --> 03:14:13,909
if I go in here? I'm going to go in, I'm going to go in the tornado. Let's see what happens.

1036
03:14:23,459 --> 03:14:29,350
Why can't I swim down? I just keep bobbing out of the water. I can't swim down.

1037
03:14:30,389 --> 03:14:47,610
Okay. Well, this is getting me nowhere. I can barely move in this water.

1038
03:14:49,290 --> 03:15:04,709
I'm just dolphin-ing out of the water. I, I, why?

1039
03:15:11,260 --> 03:15:17,989
This shit just got absolutely thrown into the atmosphere. All right. Well, do it to me too.

1040
03:15:18,629 --> 03:15:34,520
Do it to me. Do it to me. Do it to me. Wait, falling? What? You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1041
03:15:38,809 --> 03:15:52,600
Fuck you game. I did, the gravity was that strong? Okay. Ah, I didn't even,

1042
03:15:52,600 --> 03:16:09,209
could even hit me. That didn't look like it hit me. I'm not getting out of the ship ever again.

1043
03:16:09,209 --> 03:16:16,809
I'm only going to get out of the ship if it's absolutely necessary. Let's go water planet.

1044
03:16:16,809 --> 03:17:01,719
Come on. Wink. This game looks pretty neat. Left trigger goes onto water. I was holding

1045
03:17:01,719 --> 03:17:22,090
left trigger. All right. Here we go. I'm not getting out of the ship. What am I looking for

1046
03:17:22,090 --> 03:17:29,129
here? Something interesting, something weird, something cool, searching, yearning, wanting.

1047
03:17:30,090 --> 03:17:36,149
This looks pretty cool. Whatever it is, let's land. Oh yeah. Secret crystals. There's sacred

1048
03:17:36,149 --> 03:18:15,500
crystals over here. What just happened? What? Where? Um, isn't this part of the planet?

1049
03:18:16,059 --> 03:18:23,750
Isn't this part of the planet? All right. I'm confused. This is not part of the, this is the

1050
03:18:23,750 --> 03:18:33,450
planet. I, all right. I gotta get out. Look at this. Like something froze. I gotta go in there.

1051
03:18:33,450 --> 03:18:42,739
Can I get out of here or should I? Easy. All right. Get out, get out, get out, get out, unbuckle.

1052
03:18:44,389 --> 03:19:01,639
Get out. I want to see, I want to read this. It's like a, I thought that, okay. I thought this was

1053
03:19:01,639 --> 03:19:16,280
writing. I thought it was writing on the side. It's just sticking out. Ghost matter? What does

1054
03:19:16,360 --> 03:19:21,180
go? Wait, I remember that. Wait, we talked about that. Ghost matter. What's that mean?

1055
03:19:32,149 --> 03:19:50,709
Trees detected. How do I get up this? This water sucks. I gotta like land in it. I want to see the

1056
03:19:50,709 --> 03:20:15,159
ghost matter. Yep. I weigh like 6,000 pounds on this planet, apparently. Get on the surface.

1057
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:31,879
Too much gravity. Okay. I can't get up there. I'm going to use my, my camera over there.

1058
03:20:31,879 --> 03:20:51,139
I'm going to shoot my camera over here. Oh damn. All right. I got to get over there.

1059
03:20:51,139 --> 03:20:57,030
I got to get over there. I got to get over there. What? Wait, wait. Hold on. What's this?

1060
03:20:58,069 --> 03:21:22,889
Freeze. Threat detected. What? Threat detected. What? What? Threat detected. Threat detected.

1061
03:21:33,430 --> 03:21:48,549
Ghost? What are you supposed to do about the ghosts? There's just ghosts in there.

1062
03:21:50,090 --> 03:21:53,530
Shit. I was on, I was right. I was, God, I was going down there. All right. We're going to a new

1063
03:21:53,530 --> 03:21:59,590
planet. I don't like that place. I have open mysteries in like three different places.

1064
03:22:04,950 --> 03:22:17,770
The negative time interval measured at the White Pole Station was further investigated at the high

1065
03:22:17,770 --> 03:22:29,750
energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twin's equator. Or, a man named Cully has mysteriously vanished

1066
03:22:29,750 --> 03:22:34,469
from a cave at the bottom of the dry lake that at Ember Twin's North Pole. And we're going back to

1067
03:22:34,469 --> 03:22:52,520
Ember Twin. There's one on this planet. Wait, there's one on this planet. Let's find it.

1068
03:23:02,260 --> 03:23:15,670
Looking for quantum. Quantum fluctuations. Oh, crash. Don't embarrass me. Am I stuck on a tree?

1069
03:23:16,469 --> 03:23:29,139
Wait, it's in the museum. Is it the one in the museum? Or is it somewhere, is it another one on

1070
03:23:29,139 --> 03:23:46,200
the planet? No, no, there's another one. Where is that? It's in the museum. But is it though?

1071
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:54,139
It's one of the museum. Wait a minute. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold

1072
03:23:54,139 --> 03:24:05,930
up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. You say museum like an asshole. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I

1073
03:24:05,930 --> 03:24:17,879
apologize. I am from a different part of the world as you. Sorry. Excuse me. I have a slight

1074
03:24:17,879 --> 03:24:36,229
accent from a different part of the world. Excuse me. Museum. Museum. Museum. Museum. Car. Museum.

1075
03:24:37,719 --> 03:24:45,670
My room. Why do you say room? Hey, why does he say room? Is it possible that he's from a different

1076
03:24:45,670 --> 03:24:52,709
part of the world than me? How is this possible? It's not even, it's not even possible to be from

1077
03:24:52,709 --> 03:25:12,299
a different part of the world that it's not. Okay. Where am I going? He's malding about mouth noises.

1078
03:25:13,020 --> 03:25:24,120
I gotta go to my room. What the fuck did you say? Sorry. My room. My room. My room. My room. My room.

1079
03:25:26,729 --> 03:25:39,190
That's an idiot. Got it. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of

1080
03:25:39,190 --> 03:26:36,440
here. Get the fuck out of here. I found it. Ghost matter. Ghost. What am I supposed to do about that?

1081
03:26:44,760 --> 03:27:02,409
Is there more? Oh man, there's more. Wait, hold on. Photo. Well, I didn't know you could do that.

1082
03:27:02,409 --> 03:27:15,770
Okay, it's right over here. Can I like collect that shit or is there, can I walk around it?

1083
03:27:16,409 --> 03:27:24,469
Is there anything to do over there? Wait, hold on. Is there any reason to be over this way?

1084
03:27:25,110 --> 03:27:36,870
There's nothing over here. I gotta go find that quantum, quantum beam. It's a fun word to say.

1085
03:27:37,750 --> 03:27:46,170
Quantum. I want to make a username now, rather than it being like German 985,

1086
03:27:46,170 --> 03:27:50,569
like German. No, no, no. It would be, it'd be fucking quantum conundrum.

1087
03:27:53,559 --> 03:28:15,049
What? Oh, there's a way. Where is this thing? Down here. All right, let's get back in them.

1088
03:28:15,049 --> 03:28:17,610
I was gonna say, I know I say both every time, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1089
03:28:17,610 --> 03:28:23,420
there's too much to see. I can't play this game. I can't do it. I can't do it.

1090
03:28:24,059 --> 03:28:27,579
Now it's too many things to look at. Let's take somebody like the things to touch and look at and

1091
03:28:27,579 --> 03:28:44,260
press. I can't play this game. It's down here, but I'm gonna just go this way. It's down in,

1092
03:28:44,420 --> 03:28:50,790
inside the earth. Let's go this way. See if I can find it. Okay. I can't play this game. I'm gonna,

1093
03:28:50,790 --> 03:28:57,959
I'm going home. I'm out. I'll see you guys in like a month. All right. I'm gonna have to play this

1094
03:28:57,959 --> 03:29:02,200
game for the next six months to find myself alone in like my room. Sorry, my room, my room,

1095
03:29:02,200 --> 03:29:25,110
my room, my room, my room, my room. This way. Is there a spot I can go in? See like a little

1096
03:29:25,110 --> 03:29:36,780
canyon. Ooh, there's a little canyon over here, guys. Okay, guys, we found a little canyon.

1097
03:29:39,700 --> 03:29:47,850
What's down here? Maybe. Okay, guys, we can go this way. Looks like we may have stumbled across

1098
03:29:47,850 --> 03:30:12,309
something here, guys. It's like it's in there somewhere. Okay, guys. All right, we did something.

1099
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:40,950
Ah, how do I get in there? Down in the geyser or something? Let me just see what's up here.

1100
03:30:48,040 --> 03:31:10,170
Snow. All right. All right. Okay. This is icy. Oh, come on. I, I, come on. What? I was floating.

1101
03:31:10,170 --> 03:31:15,959
I was very trying to be very careful. Was I really going that fast? How fast was I going?

1102
03:31:16,760 --> 03:31:41,340
All right. I'm doing a quest, different quest, different quest. We're going to do, I don't know,

1103
03:31:41,340 --> 03:31:52,469
different. This game is good though. I like this game. I can see why people like this game.

1104
03:31:53,030 --> 03:32:07,020
It makes sense to me now. Okay. Quantum fluctuation. I'm going to go over here.

1105
03:32:07,819 --> 03:32:26,299
Let's check this side. All right. All right. Hold on. Unknown. Unknown. Here it is. It's in there.

1106
03:32:27,180 --> 03:33:02,180
All right. Everybody relax. Found it. Can I land this in here? Let's go. F.A. laugh. There it is.

1107
03:33:02,180 --> 03:33:16,920
Identified grove shard. All right. Now don't look at it. Okay. It changed. Where did it go?

1108
03:33:18,729 --> 03:33:47,340
How is it? I'll give you privacy. Now, where'd you go? Only two places? All right. Let's go update

1109
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:58,680
this. It's that one. It's a strange rock shard in this grove that moves when I'm not watching it.

1110
03:33:58,680 --> 03:34:03,620
It's a signal on the quantum fluctuations frequency. What about here? I'm looking at

1111
03:34:03,620 --> 03:34:11,430
something. Giants deep. Quantum signal on Giants deep. Bottom of the dry lake bed at Ember Twin.

1112
03:34:11,430 --> 03:34:17,620
All right. I got to get to Giants. It's deep. Wait. What's down here?

1113
03:34:19,770 --> 03:34:24,969
Kurt saw a Gnomai shipwreck shooting a beam of light into the sky somewhere in Ember Twin's

1114
03:34:24,969 --> 03:34:34,010
southern hemisphere. All right. We got to go to the Ember Twin's thing. Let's go. So much shit there.

1115
03:34:34,010 --> 03:34:56,260
Ember Twins. So what are you guys doing for the Super Bowl? Super Bowl coming up.

1116
03:34:58,309 --> 03:35:15,350
Gonna eat some pizza. Wings. What are you guys doing? All right. Let's do it. Wait. Where you

1117
03:35:15,350 --> 03:35:25,819
going? Southern hemisphere. That's it right there. Where are you going? Wait. Oh, I was wrong. It's

1118
03:35:25,819 --> 03:35:41,100
over here. Who gives a shit? I mean, who gives a shit? Who gives a shit? I don't know. All right.

1119
03:35:41,100 --> 03:35:49,450
Which one should I go on? This thing is just going for me every time. What is this thing?

1120
03:35:50,409 --> 03:35:56,659
The interloper. What the fuck is this thing? I want to know what this is. No, I don't.

1121
03:35:57,299 --> 03:36:10,540
Focus. Where is the... Where do they go? The out... No. Where is it? Did they go there? All...

1122
03:36:11,180 --> 03:36:33,030
What? The Ember... Ember Twins. All right. Go. What just happened? Okay. We're on our way.

1123
03:36:33,670 --> 03:36:41,979
Wherever it is. Where is it? I don't even know if I'm up or down. I don't know if I'm up or down.

1124
03:36:41,979 --> 03:36:56,010
There we go. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Ember Twins. Not Ashton. Ember Twins. Ember Twins.

1125
03:36:56,010 --> 03:37:22,180
All right. Ember Twins. Let's land. Slow down a little. I gotta go to the southern hemisphere

1126
03:37:22,180 --> 03:37:47,159
here. It's really fucking fast, man. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Southern hemisphere.

1127
03:37:48,420 --> 03:38:17,340
Go. Get fucking hype. Let's go, guys. There? What are we looking for? Cave Shop. Cave Shop.

1128
03:38:17,340 --> 03:38:28,520
Okay. This is the southern hemisphere. There, somewhere. Guys, why are you not getting hype?

1129
03:38:32,889 --> 03:38:38,250
Fucking... I'm gonna get... I'm gonna actually get furious in a minute. I'm not seeing enough

1130
03:38:38,250 --> 03:38:43,049
fucking people in this chat say a ton of fucking shit. Like, what the fuck?

1131
03:38:44,010 --> 03:38:56,459
Okay, so here's another one. The planets are aligned. This planet sometimes, and only sometimes,

1132
03:38:56,459 --> 03:39:01,899
has a moon. It's also of note. It disappears if no one's watching it. Isn't that a fascinating

1133
03:39:01,899 --> 03:39:08,040
orbital characteristic? It's my first time encountering a natural satellite with the

1134
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:13,260
ability to vanish when not being watched. Just study it. Or even better, we should travel there.

1135
03:39:15,129 --> 03:39:19,770
I agree. Our first step would be determining a method to track this phantom moon so we can always

1136
03:39:19,770 --> 03:39:26,969
know where it is. Given its reluctance to move while consciously observed, it might be a form of

1137
03:39:26,969 --> 03:39:37,639
macroscopic quantum mechanics. Cool. Found your note, Malore. Kindly count me among this moon's

1138
03:39:37,639 --> 03:39:44,459
admirers. What is happening when it disappears? Has it moved to another location? I believe so.

1139
03:39:44,459 --> 03:39:48,540
Not only does the moon appear around brutal hollow, I can confirm it sometimes orbits

1140
03:39:48,540 --> 03:40:02,120
timber hearth as well. All right, that's pretty cool, man. All right, I don't want this moon.

1141
03:40:02,120 --> 03:40:19,909
Freeze detected. Oh, it's a campfire. Church research note. Property of church. Clearly the

1142
03:40:19,909 --> 03:40:25,510
Nomai were making astronomical observations here. They chose an excellent spot. This is a big

1143
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:32,809
rotating device board. What was it the Nomai were observing? I'd post it. There's something special

1144
03:40:32,809 --> 03:40:38,250
about the orange symbol on that device. Al and the new astronaut's translator tool would be nice

1145
03:40:38,250 --> 03:41:12,389
to handy have right now. It'd be cool if you had it. They didn't, never mind. I need a spot to put this

1146
03:41:13,270 --> 03:41:38,170
down there. Oh, there's a big beam. God damn it, Jerma. Why are you still playing this fucking game?

1147
03:41:38,809 --> 03:41:45,659
I thought I was gonna just, just to make you angry. I knew you were gonna be here when you came in

1148
03:41:45,659 --> 03:41:49,340
and I was like, hold on. Shit, we're pretty quiet. I'm gonna make this guy, I'm just,

1149
03:41:49,340 --> 03:42:09,850
we'll only make this guy angry. Already holding. Where's the little, what's the slot? There's usually

1150
03:42:09,850 --> 03:42:23,860
a slot. Did I miss it over here? There's like an empty triangle I usually can put this in.

1151
03:42:24,500 --> 03:42:37,780
What is going on? Am I missing something here? I don't get it. Was there a slot I could have put

1152
03:42:37,780 --> 03:42:47,799
this? Wait, what do you, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is, wait, I can take this out and

1153
03:42:47,799 --> 03:42:53,139
put this in. This is the first time I've ever done that. I didn't know you'd do that. I didn't know

1154
03:42:53,139 --> 03:42:58,809
this is, I had other text on it. I thought this was, I thought this was written on this wall.

1155
03:42:59,690 --> 03:43:11,049
I didn't know you could do that. Quantum moon locator is functioning. We have markers for each

1156
03:43:11,049 --> 03:43:21,909
of the places the moon goes. Observe the quantum moon in orbit around dark bramble. Okay. You've

1157
03:43:21,909 --> 03:43:28,899
keen eyes, my friends. This moon travels to a total of five locations. Jerma, it was cool to meet you

1158
03:43:28,899 --> 03:43:37,850
at McDonald's the other day. We didn't do that. Five locations, not four. Added a marker for dark

1159
03:43:37,850 --> 03:43:43,829
bramble. I thought the locator now accounted for all the phantom moon's locations, but sometimes

1160
03:43:43,829 --> 03:43:47,030
the locator can't tell where the moon is. Perhaps there's a problem with the device.

1161
03:43:48,149 --> 03:43:53,430
It's also possible there's a sixth place in the star system where the phantom moon travels.

1162
03:43:54,229 --> 03:44:13,510
I mean, it's one, two, they line up like this. So where's the one that was the last one? How many

1163
03:44:13,510 --> 03:44:25,989
would you have? One, two, three, four, five. You don't have this right. Okay. Hold on. These are

1164
03:44:25,989 --> 03:44:34,469
always there. This one's freaking out. These two are always in the case of one, two, three are

1165
03:44:34,469 --> 03:44:48,969
always there. This one, what's this one tracking? That's tracking dark bramble. All right. This is

1166
03:44:48,969 --> 03:45:03,350
the one that I have to be looking at it. There it is. Right. I gotta go there. I gotta go there.

1167
03:45:03,350 --> 03:45:35,340
I gotta go there. What the hell is that though? I gotta go there. Fuck. How do I wait? No, wait.

1168
03:45:35,979 --> 03:45:59,350
Where'd it go? No, where'd it go? I should, I should have. Right, here it goes.

1169
03:46:00,069 --> 03:46:16,059
Ah, there it is. Here's what I have to do. I gotta get in the ship. Let's get a wafer to orbit

1170
03:46:16,059 --> 03:46:25,590
somewhere and then go to where it is. It should be there for a little while. It appears when you

1171
03:46:25,590 --> 03:47:03,510
look at it. I had it. I had it too. I was looking at it. I had it too. It's invisible right now,

1172
03:47:04,069 --> 03:47:13,100
but it's right here. You won't be able to get in the ship without it moving.

1173
03:47:15,659 --> 03:47:18,940
I just can't look at it for a second. I have to wait till it comes behind me.

1174
03:47:20,059 --> 03:47:32,520
Orbiting around. Is it that? Right now it's orbiting around. Okay, here it goes.

1175
03:47:33,799 --> 03:47:42,360
It's changing to orbit around. Where are you going? Okay, you back on the hearth. Where?

1176
03:47:42,360 --> 03:47:57,959
Wrong strategy. I don't know. Right there. On it. All right, it's right there. All right, so how do

1177
03:47:58,520 --> 03:48:07,420
I keep looking at this so I keep staying at it? It's right there. All right, I know what I'm gonna

1178
03:48:07,420 --> 03:48:10,940
do. All right, here we go. I'm gonna go to this planet and I'm gonna hang out out here until it

1179
03:48:10,940 --> 03:48:17,750
comes over this way. All right, I'm going to whatever this... I don't know what that planet's

1180
03:48:17,750 --> 03:48:21,590
called. I'm going there. All right, I'm going there. I'm going there. I'm going there. That's

1181
03:48:21,590 --> 03:48:36,629
where I'm going. What's this place called? Brittle Hollow. I'm going to Brittle Hollow. I'm gonna go

1182
03:48:36,629 --> 03:48:47,909
to Brittle Hollow and I'm gonna... I don't think I can lock it in or anything. It's gone. Yeah,

1183
03:48:48,389 --> 03:48:53,899
it just it jumps from planet to planet. Unless there's some way I have to keep it in focus

1184
03:48:53,899 --> 03:49:15,079
or something. I'm gonna say that... I know what it looks like. I'm almost dead. I'm gonna die.

1185
03:49:15,079 --> 03:49:35,829
I'm gonna die. I need to go to my ship right now. All right, I'm gonna go to Brittle Hollow

1186
03:49:35,829 --> 03:49:42,440
and I'm gonna just chill. I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna wait till it orbits. I think maybe... Let's put

1187
03:49:42,440 --> 03:49:56,329
this data in here. A quantum moon locator. Quantum moon. Sixth location. I know my hypothesis that

1188
03:49:56,329 --> 03:50:00,489
the quantum moon might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics. Quantum moon travels to a

1189
03:50:00,489 --> 03:50:07,209
total of five locations. That's not true. Quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown

1190
03:50:07,209 --> 03:50:26,260
sixth location. Disappear when no one was watching. I'm just gonna see if that works.

1191
03:50:26,899 --> 03:50:54,299
I'm just gonna see if it appears eventually. If I just chill. Am I getting too close to the sun?

1192
03:50:55,020 --> 03:51:07,430
Oh no. Oh no. We're good. Okay. We're good. All right. Looking for a moon now. Slow down. Going way too

1193
03:51:07,430 --> 03:51:17,000
fucking fast. Way too fast. All right. I need my fluctuations. I'm just gonna... There it is.

1194
03:51:17,000 --> 03:51:45,260
Right there. There it is. I found it. Why is it so far away? No, that's not it. That's not it. When is

1195
03:51:45,260 --> 03:52:14,069
it gonna orbit? Where is it? I need to be looking at it or something. Follows lantern. There it is.

1196
03:52:14,870 --> 03:52:33,989
No. What? That's not it. Is that it? I don't think so. Where is... What if... Okay. What if I go

1197
03:52:35,690 --> 03:53:02,840
and look at it? And then just in the ship look at it? And it has to travel to one of these

1198
03:53:02,840 --> 03:53:34,620
locations, right? It has to. It's got to appear here eventually. Where is the moon? Where is it?

1199
03:53:52,709 --> 03:54:34,620
Hold on. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. All right. I got an idea. I got an idea. My idea didn't work.

1200
03:54:51,829 --> 03:55:04,870
Wait. Wait a minute. I have an idea. Okay. Here's my idea. Go back on the planet with and go back

1201
03:55:04,870 --> 03:55:10,120
on the planet and listen to this shit. Back on the planet with things spinning around. You can

1202
03:55:10,120 --> 03:55:28,100
actually see the thing. Take a picture of it when you... What the fuck was that? Did I avoid it?

1203
03:55:44,329 --> 03:55:49,659
Get it in the spot that I want it and take a photo of it. Keep the photo up and then

1204
03:55:49,659 --> 03:55:54,620
it'll be there. It's just as long as somebody's looking at it. It's as long as there's a photo

1205
03:55:54,620 --> 03:56:10,329
of it or something, right? That's what I think I gotta do. The camera would technically be looking

1206
03:56:10,329 --> 03:56:31,879
at the moon the whole time. Technically. Let me try that. Let's go. He's reading a guide?

1207
03:56:32,280 --> 03:56:41,989
What? I'm not reading a guide. Why would I do that? You should fuck up though, man. You can get me

1208
03:56:41,989 --> 03:56:55,659
in trouble. All right. I know what to do. Let's go back to the ember place. That's definitely what

1209
03:56:55,659 --> 03:57:01,299
you have to do. All right. Judging by the last weird thing that I had to do. Remember when I

1210
03:57:01,299 --> 03:57:09,750
had to... What did I have to do that was kind of like that before? I had to do... There's something

1211
03:57:09,750 --> 03:57:21,860
I had to do like that before. I was eating marshmallows. No. It was different. It was

1212
03:57:21,860 --> 03:57:35,100
something else. Game boomers cheating streamer. All right. That's what I'm gonna do.

1213
03:57:36,059 --> 03:57:59,270
Give it a whirl. Is that it? Is this it? Is that it? Is this it? This is it. That's it.

1214
03:57:59,829 --> 03:58:09,719
This is it, right? All right. Slow down. This is it. Is this it? Ooh. This is it. All right. I'm on

1215
03:58:09,719 --> 03:58:14,520
the secret moon. Secret moon. I'm on secret moon. Let's go. Before it disappears. This is it, right?

1216
03:58:15,899 --> 03:58:33,020
Is it? Wait. Is that it? Wait. That's it. It's that one. It's that one. It's that one. It's that one.

1217
03:58:33,020 --> 03:58:37,129
It's that one. It's that one. No, no, no. Don't get it. Don't get it out of my sight. I have to

1218
03:58:37,129 --> 03:58:45,139
take a picture of it. I have to take a photo of it. Take a photo of it. Okay. Right? Did I get it?

1219
03:58:45,139 --> 03:59:04,040
Okay. I got a picture of it. Okay. I got a photo of it. Let's go. All right. Now, don't put the

1220
03:59:04,040 --> 03:59:29,899
camera down. Okay. Where is it? Is that it? All right. Does this work?

1221
03:59:45,819 --> 03:59:49,020
Okay. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Where is it? Is that it?

1222
03:59:49,260 --> 04:00:01,139
What? Where is it? I need my quantum fluctuations. Where is it? What's going on?

1223
04:00:02,020 --> 04:00:13,700
I don't know which direction I'm facing. Okay. There it is. No, that's not it. Where is it?

1224
04:00:14,260 --> 04:01:08,649
Is that it? No. Where is it? Wait. Hold on. Look at the photo. I was in a perfect spot. I was...

1225
04:01:08,649 --> 04:01:15,450
Okay. Let me try to redo that. I'm going to stay in the ship. I'm going to stay in the ship

1226
04:01:16,090 --> 04:01:27,899
because remember... What are you doing? Why is autopilot flying in the fucking sun?

1227
04:01:53,219 --> 04:01:59,979
Good last words. I just imagine like three or four people sitting around eating dinner

1228
04:01:59,979 --> 04:02:04,700
with autopilot on. That's the reason why the fucking driverless cars ain't ever going to work.

1229
04:02:07,670 --> 04:02:14,549
This cabbage is absolutely fantastic, dear. Thank you, honey. Yeah. But any news? Yeah. We

1230
04:02:14,549 --> 04:02:30,329
actually... Why is my game stuck? Oh, my daughter of mine. How's school? It's going great, dad.

1231
04:02:33,479 --> 04:02:40,069
What do you think about the snake, honey? It's so good, mom. You're the best.

1232
04:02:40,870 --> 04:02:48,309
Yeah, she sure is. What a happy fucking family we have. That's it. I'll do the dishes tonight.

1233
04:02:49,110 --> 04:03:10,069
Let me go over here. Honey, why is autopilot flying into the sun? Boom. God damn it. All right. Back

1234
04:03:10,069 --> 04:03:26,860
to where it was. It was right here, right? And then I'm going to stay in the ship. Yeah, I freaked

1235
04:03:26,860 --> 04:03:34,309
out. All right. I have a... I can take a picture. Wait, is it? Hold on. Hold on. Wait. I'm going to

1236
04:03:34,309 --> 04:03:42,819
do the exact same fucking thing I did. There's no cabbage in space. Oh, please.

1237
04:03:42,819 --> 04:03:52,329
Please. My apologies. All right. Don't fucking crash. Don't crash. Okay. I freaked out here

1238
04:03:52,329 --> 04:03:58,659
because I was like, oh, this is it. And then I saw it. Where did I see it? It was like

1239
04:04:00,709 --> 04:04:12,229
right here somewhere. I'll wait till I can see it. And then I'm going to look

1240
04:04:15,799 --> 04:04:33,020
for it. It's going to port over here eventually. Don't break. Come on. Where is it? Because I had

1241
04:04:33,020 --> 04:04:48,979
it too. I had it. Actually had the damn thing. It... All right. Take a picture of it. Quick.

1242
04:04:49,540 --> 04:04:52,340
Slow down. Slow down. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Take a picture of it. Quick.

1243
04:04:53,139 --> 04:05:19,579
Now what? Can I land on this or something? What am I supposed to do? I'm in. I made it.

1244
04:05:26,729 --> 04:05:44,649
I found the quantum moon and there's some fucked up shit going on over here. Wait, where'd it go?

1245
04:05:48,219 --> 04:06:09,930
What? Okay. Was I almost about to get squished in the elevator? Was I actually about to die to that?

1246
04:06:09,930 --> 04:06:15,750
That would have been so embarrassing. I would have ended the stream. Okay. Turn the lights on.

1247
04:06:16,549 --> 04:06:27,479
Okay. So we have some translation here. You have recalled the rule of quantum imaging.

1248
04:06:27,479 --> 04:06:34,420
Recall the rule of quantum entanglement. Recall the rule of the sixth location.

1249
04:06:35,379 --> 04:06:48,520
Eh. Tell me the rule of higher pay grade than me is going to have to come figure this one out.

1250
04:06:49,479 --> 04:06:56,469
Have to move these or something? All right. I remember seeing this image on... Okay. These

1251
04:06:56,469 --> 04:07:05,879
are just the planets. But this is currently set onto the twin embers, right? Ember moon,

1252
04:07:05,879 --> 04:07:14,149
ember planet, and ash planet. So why is that on there right now? Why is that there? These are

1253
04:07:14,149 --> 04:07:20,219
just the... Okay. There's like the bramble. There's whatever that is. What locations are these? Okay.

1254
04:07:20,219 --> 04:07:38,010
I don't know. I can't move this. What does this shit say? You recall the rule of quantum imaging.

1255
04:07:38,809 --> 04:07:48,579
Quantum entanglement. Sixth location. I don't know what the sixth location is.

1256
04:07:49,620 --> 04:08:15,670
Let me explore this place a little more. What's this? That's not mine. That's a different ship.

1257
04:08:16,389 --> 04:08:31,750
Whose ship is this? That's not my ship. What is this? I'm here after watching it wander the

1258
04:08:31,750 --> 04:08:39,500
skies for so long. I'm about to stand on the quantum moon. As expected, my shuttle has landed

1259
04:08:39,500 --> 04:08:45,319
at the moon's south pole. I will make the remainder of my journey on foot. If you don't know why the

1260
04:08:45,319 --> 04:08:50,520
quantum moon always welcomes its visitors at the south pole, just that this is true. As a child,

1261
04:08:50,520 --> 04:08:55,959
I considered such unknowns sinister. Now, though, I understand they bear no ill will. The universe is,

1262
04:08:55,959 --> 04:10:04,309
and we are. I am ready. Shit. I'm here. Where is here? This is that ship room before. I don't...

1263
04:10:05,350 --> 04:10:25,049
I think I might be in trouble here. Look, just jump on a cactus. Well, I got a lot of info.

1264
04:10:26,920 --> 04:10:28,200
All right. Can I make it? Let's try.

1265
04:10:38,709 --> 04:10:54,069
The ultimate fall joke. It's gonna last 10 straight minutes. Actually, I might get there.

1266
04:10:54,950 --> 04:11:08,629
No, I'll get there. I'm gonna get there. I'm never... Somebody said I'm never gonna beat this.

1267
04:11:09,750 --> 04:11:19,110
I think I've made pretty good progress so far. I found the secret moon. I found the Cadbury egg.

1268
04:11:19,750 --> 04:11:34,819
Where is my... What is my ship doing over here? Wait, what? Wait. Wait. Why is it floating? I

1269
04:11:34,819 --> 04:12:44,250
thought it was on the moon. What? See you, nerd. God damn it. Just watch the fireworks when the

1270
04:12:44,250 --> 04:12:57,659
universe ends. I'm gonna be pretty far away. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, what is that photo of?

1271
04:12:58,620 --> 04:13:14,600
How did it get up there? I just want to see it one more time. No, I just want to see it one more

1272
04:13:14,600 --> 04:13:42,940
time before I die. You're not leading it enough. That's too far away.

1273
04:14:05,129 --> 04:14:11,049
So what did I... That thing teleported me back to... I pressed the wrong button or something?

1274
04:14:11,930 --> 04:14:13,530
All right. Let me... I gotta go see.

1275
04:14:15,450 --> 04:14:52,709
There we go. Boom. Go. There it is. There it goes. Whatever it is. Okay. Let's go take a look at the

1276
04:14:52,709 --> 04:15:13,299
data. Data. What we got? You found the quantum moon. You found the quantum shrine. You found

1277
04:15:13,299 --> 04:15:24,950
the quantum shuttle. You found the gravity cannon. I recalled a Nomai shuttle from the quantum moon.

1278
04:15:24,950 --> 04:15:38,409
A Nomai named Solanum landed at her shuttle at the quantum moon's south pole and prepared to make

1279
04:15:38,409 --> 04:15:42,409
the rest of the journey on foot. Visitors to the quantum moon always arrive at the south pole for

1280
04:15:42,409 --> 04:15:48,700
reasons unknown. The quantum moon sometimes disappears possibly to an unknown sixth location.

1281
04:15:49,739 --> 04:15:56,950
Nomai detected a quantum signal coming from somewhere on Giants deep.

1282
04:16:02,229 --> 04:16:11,079
Where's the quantum McDonald's? That's pretty good.

1283
04:16:11,799 --> 04:16:19,899
Okay. I'm gonna go do this. This is red for some reason and I glazed over this.

1284
04:16:19,899 --> 04:16:33,510
Ember Twin. Southern hemisphere. Let's go. All right. If you went up this quickly,

1285
04:16:33,510 --> 04:17:03,399
would your stomach go into your esophagus? Probably would. This one. Your brain would go into your

1286
04:17:03,399 --> 04:17:15,620
stomach. What the fuck, man? Why are you doing this to me? It's trying to kill me. It's trying

1287
04:17:15,620 --> 04:17:28,260
to kill me. Autopilot again. Just use autopilot, Jerma. It's easier. It won't magnetize you into

1288
04:17:28,260 --> 04:17:51,209
the sun. What a depressing replay. That's the kind of replay where you accidentally

1289
04:17:51,209 --> 04:17:56,729
recorded on the PS4 for five seconds. Ten seconds, you're like, how the fuck did I do that?

1290
04:17:57,370 --> 04:18:27,159
This is me sitting at the menu. Auto pilot. Not yet. Wait till I get to a safe place.

1291
04:18:32,090 --> 04:18:38,649
Okay. Engaging autopilot. No, don't do that. Stop. Turn it off. It's gonna go right in the fucking sun.

1292
04:18:39,690 --> 04:19:15,450
All right. Get on here. Land this thing. And there's the beacon of light right there.

1293
04:19:16,729 --> 04:19:39,270
Jesus Christ. Where am I? I thought I did it right. I thought I did it right.

1294
04:19:43,430 --> 04:20:03,750
I was going too fast. Autopilot. Okay. I'm good. Oh, Christ. Where's that thing coming from?

1295
04:20:04,389 --> 04:20:32,120
Where's that beacon? There's a light beacon. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? There it is.

1296
04:20:32,120 --> 04:20:49,750
Oh, that's different. What's that? Oh, look at that. All right. Land. Good. Get me the hell

1297
04:20:49,750 --> 04:21:07,860
out of here. Oh, find signal nearby. Frequency. Oh, is it one of these things? Escape pod.

1298
04:21:07,860 --> 04:21:28,649
Distress beacon. Escape pod. What happened? We need status reports for all systems.

1299
04:21:28,729 --> 04:21:33,610
The initial things first. Is everyone unharmed? Our escape pods passengers are afraid.

1300
04:21:34,250 --> 04:21:40,579
They're physically well. Inanna, everyone survived the crash. This is a relief at least.

1301
04:21:40,579 --> 04:21:44,899
You have my gratitude. Burr, we were able to find the other escape pods distress signals.

1302
04:21:45,940 --> 04:21:50,100
I can hear both signals somewhere in this star system, but I don't believe either escape pod

1303
04:21:50,100 --> 04:21:57,959
crashed on the same planet as us.

1304
04:21:58,440 --> 04:22:16,739
What is this? Too close to read. Launching escape pod three. Now launching escape pod two.

1305
04:22:17,379 --> 04:22:26,170
Collision imminent. Preparing for impact. Scanning external environment. Scan complete.

1306
04:22:26,170 --> 04:22:33,129
External temperature is prohibitively high. Verdict inhospitable. Do not seek shelter on

1307
04:22:33,129 --> 04:22:39,500
this planet. Escape pod two. Vessel has been mortally injured. Emergency sequence

1308
04:22:39,500 --> 04:22:49,989
activated. Awaiting departure from vessel. All right, so it hurt. All right, somebody got hurt.

1309
04:22:56,180 --> 04:23:03,219
Beat from the star system sun is more bearable below the surface. When our escape pod punctured

1310
04:23:03,219 --> 04:23:08,979
this planet's surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air.

1311
04:23:08,979 --> 04:23:15,620
I would recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter.

1312
04:23:16,500 --> 04:23:25,659
Inanna, but these passages are a maze. Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for

1313
04:23:25,659 --> 04:23:30,860
survival. We'll form teams and descend into the caves to look for shelter. We can mark our findings

1314
04:23:30,860 --> 04:23:38,090
on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost. Be cautious everyone and be aware of the sand as

1315
04:23:38,090 --> 04:24:10,659
you search. It appears to be rising gradually. There's a lot of writings down here. Put it away.

1316
04:24:10,659 --> 04:24:23,620
What's this? Emergency escape hatch. We have found an enormous cavern at the end of this passage

1317
04:24:23,620 --> 04:24:30,040
that appears promising. I believe we could construct long-term shelter there. Cavern

1318
04:24:30,040 --> 04:24:35,079
Malorre found. It's a wise choice for shelter. Could be... could one of you

1319
04:24:35,079 --> 04:24:40,889
mark directions for the others to follow? This is the start of the path to the shelter site.

1320
04:24:40,889 --> 04:24:46,469
I've left directions to guide you there. Of note, we must hurry as the pathway there is filling with

1321
04:24:46,469 --> 04:24:50,549
sand. Do not allow yourself to be buried by sand and make sure no one is lost.

1322
04:24:51,430 --> 04:25:03,319
Let's read everything. Do not follow this tunnel to its end.

1323
04:25:03,319 --> 04:25:09,559
Holius and I will examine the horror that lies in its terminus later. Why did we live through this?

1324
04:25:10,120 --> 04:25:18,760
We'll go down there. Keep moving, friends. There's nothing of interest at the end of this passage

1325
04:25:18,760 --> 04:25:24,090
but rocks. And while these rocks are interesting, they can wait until a less urgent time.

1326
04:25:25,049 --> 04:25:38,569
All right, what about over here? No, this passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank

1327
04:25:38,569 --> 04:25:44,149
there. Cannot tell you how far or deep these tunnels may wind. Do not linger as the area is

1328
04:25:44,149 --> 04:26:00,860
exposed to the heat of this alien sun. All right, let's refill. Refill your air supply tank and

1329
04:26:00,860 --> 04:26:29,290
return quickly. Is there anything else out here? That's cool. There's something bad at the end of

1330
04:26:29,290 --> 04:27:27,530
this tunnel. Do I dare do this? I said don't do this. I don't get it. Why? Well, I can't go down

1331
04:27:27,530 --> 04:27:50,139
here anyway. I can't like go through here. Well, I'm gonna go down the path. Let's get oxygen first.

1332
04:27:50,139 --> 04:27:54,620
Which way is oxygen? This way, right? Which way? This way? That way? This way? There's oxygen.

1333
04:27:54,620 --> 04:28:08,969
Over here? This way? This way? Totally oxygen. Let's go down the path and see what we find.

1334
04:28:11,979 --> 04:28:37,819
Let's go. All right, watch out for the sand. Then move quickly because the sand is filling up.

1335
04:28:39,459 --> 04:28:53,879
Okay, over here. Watch out for the sand. All right, there's a spot over here. All right, guys,

1336
04:28:54,520 --> 04:29:04,149
I've gotten rings in Dark Souls that were harder than this. The path to the shelter site is somewhat

1337
04:29:04,149 --> 04:29:16,629
convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely. I wasn't making a joke. I'm just being

1338
04:29:16,629 --> 04:29:23,430
real. I mean, you do this in Dark Souls 2 to get shit, you know? Just saying.

1339
04:29:24,389 --> 04:29:35,860
Uh, reach the shelter site. Walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit.

1340
04:29:37,610 --> 04:29:43,129
Then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through

1341
04:29:43,129 --> 04:29:51,540
the opening above them. Sand here is rising, so you must be cautious with the swift. Forward

1342
04:29:51,540 --> 04:29:57,379
till you meet the sandfall. Forward until the pit. Turn left. Continue the room with rocks. Go up.

1343
04:29:58,180 --> 04:30:30,739
Sand pit left. Rocks. Rocks. Then go up. Go up. Are there any more instructions?

1344
04:30:31,459 --> 04:30:40,010
There we go. Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Malore and I crafted will do its job,

1345
04:30:40,010 --> 04:30:51,000
but it isn't strong. Oh, shit. Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling

1346
04:30:51,000 --> 04:30:59,139
sand. Follow it and you'll reach the shelter. Can I walk on this shit? I just jump and...

1347
04:30:59,299 --> 04:31:29,430
Okay, now go behind the sand. Can I go, can I get back? Can I go behind this? Can I go behind that?

1348
04:31:29,430 --> 04:31:35,530
Does it go behind the sand? Is that gonna hurt me? Is that gonna kill me? Is it gonna kill me?

1349
04:31:35,530 --> 04:31:43,940
Holy fuck, I made it. I thought it was gonna kill me. You're doing well. There's only a little

1350
04:31:43,940 --> 04:31:47,940
farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry before the sand

1351
04:31:47,940 --> 04:32:08,870
comes. Up there? How the hell did they make it up there? They built a shitty bridge there?

1352
04:32:09,270 --> 04:32:19,110
There? Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming.

1353
04:32:19,110 --> 04:32:26,629
Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming. Sand's coming.

1354
04:32:28,680 --> 04:32:54,819
Open the door. Up? Which way? What is this? Hold on. Wait, what about up here? This is amazing.

1355
04:32:54,819 --> 04:32:58,500
Look inside the cave. How did this come to rest here? We haven't encountered others in this cave.

1356
04:32:58,500 --> 04:33:05,659
I think this is a rare find. From what we can see, Coleus and I believe the specimen must be very

1357
04:33:05,659 --> 04:33:13,669
old indeed. Imagine what we might learn if we could examine it. If we both agree it's unlikely

1358
04:33:13,669 --> 04:33:18,069
this dry planet is this horrors place of origin, especially considering what we observed during

1359
04:33:18,069 --> 04:33:24,340
the vessel's evacuation. Clearly this hole is too small for it to fit through. Hypothesis,

1360
04:33:24,340 --> 04:33:29,110
there's another entrance to this cave. If there is, Coleus and I will find it. We can't leave

1361
04:33:29,110 --> 04:33:35,270
valuable information undiscovered. Update. We need to find a way inside quickly.

1362
04:33:35,990 --> 04:33:40,069
Melore, because when I have returned here to search for an entrance to the cave there were

1363
04:33:40,069 --> 04:33:59,669
children playing on the specimen. I didn't need that info. Okay, well. All right, I don't want

1364
04:33:59,669 --> 04:34:08,869
to fall anywhere so I gotta be careful. I can't see shit. How about over? Hold on. Anglerfish

1365
04:34:08,869 --> 04:34:21,979
fossil overlook. Three? What? Only three minutes of oxygen. Hold on. What is this? Hold on.

1366
04:34:29,689 --> 04:34:39,639
What's this shit over here? Oxygen? Nope. There's shit over here. There's stuff over here.

1367
04:34:42,459 --> 04:34:51,959
Um, I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for. It's blind. I mean, I have tunnel vision right

1368
04:34:51,959 --> 04:35:13,049
now. I'm looking for a flashlight. How do I get in there? Holy fucking shit. I've got to get out

1369
04:35:13,049 --> 04:35:18,819
of here right now. How do I get out? How do I get out? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

1370
04:35:20,650 --> 04:35:40,200
How do I get out of this? How do I get out of here? What the fuck? Hey, should we build a

1371
04:35:40,200 --> 04:35:44,759
sun station to the power of this Ash project? Are there any ways to generate this level of power?

1372
04:35:44,759 --> 04:35:47,880
Theoretically, as per our act, we know we can't imagine discovering anything like that.

1373
04:35:47,880 --> 04:35:50,840
I understand this proposal is not simple, but the sun station must be built if we hope to

1374
04:35:50,840 --> 04:35:55,319
complete the Ashman project. I almost can't comprehend this being the suggestion. So the

1375
04:35:55,319 --> 04:35:58,360
purpose of the sun station goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything

1376
04:35:58,360 --> 04:36:04,139
we believe. Unsurprisingly, I disagree if we're pushing a possible new technology further than

1377
04:36:04,139 --> 04:36:07,340
ever before. That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.

1378
04:36:08,380 --> 04:36:12,619
If we fail, and the probability of this is insignificant, we will without question destroy

1379
04:36:12,619 --> 04:36:15,979
ourselves. All life here and the rest of the star system I wish to protect these species.

1380
04:36:17,180 --> 04:36:21,099
The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost. We shouldn't build

1381
04:36:21,099 --> 04:36:26,139
the sun station no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it. Fear of failure is

1382
04:36:26,139 --> 04:36:29,819
a poor reason not to try. I believe, with curiosity, the sun station will be a work.

1383
04:36:31,979 --> 04:36:37,419
I'm deeply honored. I comprehend your position, however, if we aren't all but certain the sun

1384
04:36:37,419 --> 04:36:41,020
station will not cause destruction, once we build it then I won't support the station's use.

1385
04:39:21,529 --> 04:39:32,409
Sunless City. Anglerfish Fossil. Sun Station. You know my debate of building a sun station

1386
04:39:32,409 --> 04:39:58,090
in order to power the Ash Twin Project. Canyon at Ember Twin's Equator. Canyon at Ember Twin's Equator.

1387
04:40:01,130 --> 04:40:20,119
What are you doing? Well, it's full of sand now, so I don't think I can do much. I don't think I can

1388
04:40:20,119 --> 04:40:45,220
do anything else here. It's getting close. That thing's dumping sand. That's the other,

1389
04:40:45,220 --> 04:40:57,319
right, okay. So I have to go, I have to turn that sand off. I don't know. It's taking over

1390
04:40:57,319 --> 04:41:35,500
the whole planet. Wait, look at it. Where is it? Is that gonna keep going? Yeah, yeah, I'm dead.

1391
04:41:37,130 --> 04:41:40,889
Yeah, I'm dead. I'm just dead. All right, now for the next time, I know this is sad. I'm gonna go to

1392
04:41:40,889 --> 04:41:48,180
the, yeah, I'm just gonna bump my head a bunch more times. I'll be fine. Yeah, I mean, three

1393
04:41:48,180 --> 04:41:57,020
minutes remaining. Uh, actually, I might be able to get there. I wonder, should I fly to that planet?

1394
04:42:04,180 --> 04:42:27,110
Can I land on this? I wonder if I can actually get on top. I'll probably put your seatbelt on.

1395
04:42:28,389 --> 04:43:02,650
I haven't even looked at this yet. Hey, I remember this. I'm going in here. It's huge.

1396
04:43:03,290 --> 04:44:13,500
I mean, what's the purpose of this? The sun hungers. Uh, I think we're dead. What's the

1397
04:44:13,500 --> 04:45:11,930
significance of this place? Bye, everybody. Got it. Unreal Tournament map. So it's safe to say he

1398
04:45:11,930 --> 04:45:27,580
knows about the supernova now. Yeah, yeah, I'd say that's a pretty safe assessment. There it goes

1399
04:45:27,580 --> 04:45:38,060
again. I kind of want to investigate what that is. You know what I mean? I want to go just, I want

1400
04:45:38,060 --> 04:45:50,259
to go up there. That thing, I'm going up there. I want to know what that is. This thing keeps

1401
04:45:50,259 --> 04:46:12,759
exploding every time I die. Why? What's the point? Well, this is unknown. What's this unknown

1402
04:46:12,759 --> 04:46:26,939
signal? I can't slow down. Is it the ship itself doing that? No, it's something on that planet,

1403
04:46:26,939 --> 04:46:51,430
but I still want to know what this is. I'm going to hit the surface of this planet.

1404
04:46:52,069 --> 04:47:14,979
Oh, something in there. All right, something in there. It's going too fast. Wait, can I get

1405
04:47:14,979 --> 04:47:37,319
in there close? Where did it go? Where is it? What? What is going on? So we're getting sucked

1406
04:47:37,319 --> 04:48:03,299
into the gravity. Okay. Get over here. All right, there it is. Land on it. Land on it. I landed.

1407
04:48:03,299 --> 04:48:33,189
Did I? What's wrong? What happened? What? Uh, how did I? I didn't put the suit on. I, yeah, whatever.

1408
04:48:33,189 --> 04:48:38,279
And it took me so long to get there too. Well, look, it happened again.

1409
04:48:44,150 --> 04:48:47,590
I thought you were making that choking sound. I thought there was something in that hole

1410
04:48:48,919 --> 04:49:09,610
making that choking sound. All right, where is it? How come I can't see it?

1411
04:49:10,409 --> 04:49:17,659
Is it behind the moon thing? Whatever this is. There you go.

1412
04:49:29,779 --> 04:50:29,400
Come here. I screwed up this time. All right, let's check this place out. Damn it. My microphone's

1413
04:50:29,400 --> 04:50:34,759
been delayed by 650 milliseconds the whole stream because we played Xbox 360 yesterday.

1414
04:50:35,959 --> 04:51:01,060
You knew from the start. Let's do the whole stream again. God, I hate when that shit happens.

1415
04:51:02,659 --> 04:51:08,279
This capturing the 360, you have to delay your voice because it takes like almost a whole second

1416
04:51:08,279 --> 04:51:24,250
for the capture card to pull it into OBS. God damn it. Well, I found this. It wasn't that

1417
04:51:24,250 --> 04:51:33,220
noticeable. Well, it was definitely noticeable when I was just being missed by asteroids and

1418
04:51:33,220 --> 04:51:40,729
screaming almost a false second later. Here comes the asteroid. Oh, it just passed. Oh,

1419
04:51:46,840 --> 04:51:56,119
probe tracking module. I thought you were just slow. Like my brain. Sorry guys. Oh, that was

1420
04:51:56,119 --> 04:52:24,810
scary. Oh shit. Control module. Launch module. This thing. Fucking pea brain. Shatters through

1421
04:52:24,810 --> 04:52:48,500
the glass. All right. What should I go into? I'm going to go over here. All right. So this is,

1422
04:52:49,220 --> 04:53:48,919
I'm going to put this thing back together. I don't get it. I don't get it. It's different.

1423
04:53:50,200 --> 04:53:55,319
I have bad news. Yaro says there was a problem with the proposed power source.

1424
04:53:55,959 --> 04:54:05,580
So the orbital probe cannon won't be asked to fire. I hope you're pulling my locomotive limb here.

1425
04:54:07,580 --> 04:54:13,380
I wish I were my friend, but no, they aren't certain they can fix the problem. So the

1426
04:54:13,380 --> 04:54:23,290
orbitable probe cannon is on indefinite hiatus. Tell Privet and Malo, oh, they should return from

1427
04:54:23,290 --> 04:54:32,259
the cannon. My spouse and I were made at the construction yard for now. An update. Malo and

1428
04:54:32,259 --> 04:54:37,459
I will join you in Daz. Privet left to visit her brother. She fears Aidea may feel responsible.

1429
04:54:38,580 --> 04:54:51,689
Construction yard? What about this one? Does this one do anything for us?

1430
04:55:07,909 --> 04:55:30,709
Uh, can I read that? Well, we got some info. I guess we got some info. Okay, info. Got it.

1431
04:55:30,709 --> 04:55:37,860
It's been around back to where we were. This can go all the way.

1432
04:55:38,979 --> 04:55:53,860
I guess I'm going to put the marble through. You go down? What is that? Uh, that's a device

1433
04:55:53,860 --> 04:56:05,159
of some sort. With randomly selected probe trajectory, gravity field activated.

1434
04:56:05,959 --> 04:56:13,939
Five minutes 54 seconds ago, request to launch probe received from Ash Twin project.

1435
04:56:14,740 --> 04:56:38,500
Do the other one. So that's the cannon. Any more knowledge? Probe apart, as it didn't work.

1436
04:56:39,459 --> 04:56:47,270
Begin launch log. Orbital probe cannon. Launch request received. Probe launch successful.

1437
04:56:47,830 --> 04:56:52,979
Probe tracking module is receiving data from probe.

1438
04:56:54,340 --> 04:56:59,290
Orbital probe cannon structure compromised during launch. Damage to multiple modules detected.

1439
04:57:00,409 --> 04:57:25,130
Orbital probe cannon damage report. Severe structural stress detected.

1440
04:57:25,290 --> 04:57:27,849
Accessing damage to modules.

1441
04:57:29,130 --> 04:57:34,360
Probe module intact. No structural damage. Launch module. Viewport window fractured.

1442
04:57:34,360 --> 04:57:39,139
Module exposed to vacuum of space. Probe tracking module missing.

1443
04:57:42,470 --> 04:57:49,270
So wait, so this thing explodes every time I wake up and something shoots out of it.

1444
04:57:50,979 --> 04:58:00,919
Maybe I should follow that thing. I just try to chase that thing down? What just happened?

1445
04:58:01,560 --> 04:58:33,270
Well, my better 50%. The SAVA is sending the last of the cannon components soon.

1446
04:58:33,830 --> 04:58:36,790
Relatively speaking, we'll know the eye's precise location.

1447
04:58:37,990 --> 04:58:42,950
SAVA tells me he and the construction yard crew have determined a power setting we are not

1448
04:58:44,340 --> 04:58:52,069
under any circumstances to go above. I see. And am I right to think that consequently we'll

1449
04:58:52,069 --> 04:58:59,880
be ignoring that setting? Stupid. I can posit with nearly 100% certainty our friends have

1450
04:58:59,880 --> 04:59:07,290
accounted for our nature so I suggest we do. Giving the orbital probe cannon all the power

1451
04:59:07,290 --> 04:59:11,290
it can structurally withstand creates the greatest chance of finding the eye of the universe.

1452
04:59:12,729 --> 04:59:18,250
Yes, the probe must travel as fast as it can. As far as it can, I'll make some adjustments.

1453
04:59:19,450 --> 04:59:25,900
The thought of concluding our elders' curious and challenging search increases my heart's

1454
04:59:25,900 --> 04:59:35,459
temperature. My love. They're trying to find the center of the universe. They found it. They

1455
04:59:35,459 --> 04:59:40,580
went too deep. Caused a fucking time paradox and now I have to fix that. I have to be the one that

1456
04:59:40,580 --> 04:59:45,380
fucking closes the time loop because they screwed it all up. Because they shot whatever they shot.

1457
04:59:46,259 --> 05:00:01,270
What was that? Oh, these things I played on. All right, I'm going to the other module.

1458
05:00:12,380 --> 05:00:16,729
Really, I'm having a lot of fun playing the game. Get out of town.

1459
05:00:17,529 --> 05:00:44,139
Probe tracking. I don't think it exists anymore. I think it's broken. In fact,

1460
05:00:44,139 --> 05:00:46,060
I don't think this is a good idea, but I'm going to do it anyways.

1461
05:00:46,779 --> 05:01:08,220
The module is gone. Who would have thought? What about over here? This is where it fires from.

1462
05:01:09,099 --> 05:01:20,009
All right, is there something I missed in here? There's another section I could go in, right?

1463
05:01:20,810 --> 05:01:31,189
It's tracking this launching. And what was this one? This one I just came from?

1464
05:01:33,270 --> 05:01:38,950
Control module. It's this one up here. It's the one I had to go into, right? For a second,

1465
05:01:38,950 --> 05:01:50,220
I thought that was a probe module and I was like, what did I just find? Did I go in this one? No,

1466
05:01:50,299 --> 05:02:16,889
I can't. This is blocked off too. All right, nothing in here anymore. Wait, wait. All right,

1467
05:02:16,889 --> 05:02:25,819
I'm getting it out of here. I went in all the modules, right? But for this one, I'm kind of

1468
05:02:25,819 --> 05:02:38,619
getting turned around on the other side. Yeah, I need fuel. I got to go to the ship.

1469
05:02:56,569 --> 05:03:10,520
Okay, um, oh god, I'm just stretching my back a little. Should I stay? Let me try going that

1470
05:03:10,520 --> 05:03:31,959
other side. So I got to fire on the moon. So I got to go around. I go from here and just fly

1471
05:03:31,959 --> 05:03:50,520
it down here, right? I need to go in the window. Is this the right side? Where was that window?

1472
05:03:51,159 --> 05:04:08,659
Where was that correct window with the scout there? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1473
05:04:09,299 --> 05:04:39,099
What's in here? More stuff. Okay. Imagine, Privet, the probe tracking module will be the first to

1474
05:04:39,099 --> 05:04:44,310
know the coordinates of the eye of the universe. You'll be the first to see them. Honored and

1475
05:04:44,310 --> 05:04:49,540
terrified. You won't ask the orbital probe cannon to use so much power that it breaks, will you?

1476
05:04:50,419 --> 05:04:57,340
Right? Not my nervous friend. We only need to fire the probe once. Anyway, so who minds if it

1477
05:04:57,340 --> 05:05:04,250
compromises the cannon's structural integrity? I would mind, Malo. I would mind because we won't

1478
05:05:04,250 --> 05:05:08,569
be capable of receiving our probe's data if the probe tracking module is destroyed.

1479
05:05:08,569 --> 05:05:44,630
Dummy. Oh, there's one floating. That's the statue. Okay. That was weird. Let's grab the other one.

1480
05:05:45,270 --> 05:06:14,860
What is this one? Let's try this one. What is that? What is that thing? I don't know. Let's go see

1481
05:06:14,860 --> 05:06:23,990
what they say. It's the other room. Malo, my better 50% cassava is sending the last of the

1482
05:06:23,990 --> 05:06:27,590
cannon components soon. We'll know the eye's location. Yeah. Didn't I already do this?

1483
05:06:28,470 --> 05:06:35,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Our elders curiosity. Construction yard, groove, a power setting.

1484
05:06:35,259 --> 05:06:53,139
Didn't I already do this? Percent certainty. Yeah, I did this already. Okay. It's the other side.

1485
05:06:53,860 --> 05:07:09,159
Can I do anything over here? Are you reading somebody else's DMs? Well, what else is there

1486
05:07:09,159 --> 05:07:19,080
to do in here? Besides this stuff. All right. I need to put this data in and see what the hell

1487
05:07:19,080 --> 05:07:23,750
I'm going to do next. I need to find this construction yard. I just broke my neck. I just

1488
05:07:23,750 --> 05:07:32,810
shattered my fucking all my vertebrae in the top. All right, I made it out. Now let's go to the

1489
05:07:32,810 --> 05:07:57,590
ship. This data that I thought I was gonna get crushed. Input the data. I got a lot of it.

1490
05:07:58,150 --> 05:08:11,740
What do we got now? Probe cannon, tracking module, control module, construction yard.

1491
05:08:12,700 --> 05:08:20,200
You know, I built the orbit probe cannon at a construction yard on giants deep.

1492
05:08:22,009 --> 05:08:36,360
All right. I know where we're going. Question. No spoilers. But how far into the game am I

1493
05:08:36,360 --> 05:08:54,139
currently right now? Are we yet? Like, how far? Like percentage wise? And we're around 30 to 40%

1494
05:08:55,099 --> 05:09:11,509
35% 35. Okay. All right. 25 30% 25%. Okay. Just making sure that I don't go too far. So this

1495
05:09:11,509 --> 05:09:25,770
because I want to stream this tomorrow too. I just exploded. All right. We want to go to that.

1496
05:09:25,770 --> 05:09:32,840
What was it called? Giants? Giants deep, right? That's right there. All right. So we're gonna

1497
05:09:32,840 --> 05:09:49,000
find this construction yard. This planet that's all water. Construction yard. Navigate this

1498
05:09:50,279 --> 05:10:07,909
construction yard. No, but I mean, it looks like there's something. Hold on.

1499
05:10:08,630 --> 05:10:17,130
I'm gonna land here. Have I been here before? I don't remember if I've been here before.

1500
05:10:18,090 --> 05:10:57,340
What is happening? This is in this part of the planet. What the fuck am I?

1501
05:10:57,900 --> 05:11:10,409
There's a landing pad. The landing pad doesn't solve the problem of the whole island getting

1502
05:11:10,409 --> 05:11:29,819
picked up and thrown into space. I'll park damn thing on the pad. Hold on. All right. I'm in the

1503
05:11:29,819 --> 05:11:48,330
pad. This whole thing can get picked up and get thrown into space. Is this a construction yard?

1504
05:11:48,810 --> 05:12:01,080
Am I getting a jetpack tutorial booster? Okay. Oh my god. I'm so embarrassed because it's like

1505
05:12:01,080 --> 05:12:05,560
popped up on the screen and fucked with my head. I'm so actually embarrassed right now.

1506
05:12:06,840 --> 05:12:10,520
I'm annoyed by that. I can't believe it. It popped up on the screen. I was like, why is it showing

1507
05:12:10,520 --> 05:12:23,139
this? I've done this a hundred times. Yes. Hold. RT. Hold. Yes. Guys. Guys. I don't know why.

1508
05:12:23,939 --> 05:12:26,819
I don't understand why I'm doing that. I don't get it. I don't understand. I've done this

1509
05:12:27,220 --> 05:12:32,259
a thousand times. I've jumped like 50 fucking gaps. Is this text? Why is the text even on

1510
05:12:32,259 --> 05:12:49,430
the screen right now? Why is it doing this to me? Oh, it's the huge gravity. Right. I forgot. It's

1511
05:12:49,430 --> 05:12:58,279
the only planet that I've got. Oh my god. I forgot. This planet has like times 10 gravity.

1512
05:12:58,279 --> 05:13:46,169
The only one that does. Statue workshop. Ooh, that's broken. Can you get in? That was easy.

1513
05:13:46,169 --> 05:14:06,099
I'm going to jump over there. Block this way. Tree's detected. All right. Nice.

1514
05:14:06,979 --> 05:14:18,299
Destruction site. Oh, I've never seen this in my dream.

1515
05:14:31,099 --> 05:14:37,979
Text. We're going to test the memory statues tonight. Block says it could be dangerous,

1516
05:14:37,979 --> 05:14:44,200
so we can't. I'm dead. Well, what if we don't see the door and sneak the other way around?

1517
05:14:44,759 --> 05:14:48,279
We really want to see the test too, Liam, but that's a huge risk to take. We probably shouldn't

1518
05:14:48,279 --> 05:14:53,080
make flocks. Maybe flocks will let us test it later. Block specifically told us not to do that.

1519
05:14:53,639 --> 05:14:56,439
We're going to test the memory statues tonight. Be dangerous.

1520
05:14:57,400 --> 05:15:12,970
I only got the clue at least. Yeah. Memory statues.

1521
05:15:34,069 --> 05:15:57,419
Every time I tune in, you die. There it goes. All right. I'm going to go back there.

1522
05:16:00,040 --> 05:16:10,840
That's your workshop. That's your island. I energy lab. So these are going to connect eventually

1523
05:16:10,840 --> 05:16:18,439
here. That's your workshop leads to gabbro. Find steep to learn more about the statue.

1524
05:16:18,439 --> 05:16:23,159
That's your leads to here. You lead to statue island, which leads to the energy lab, which

1525
05:16:23,159 --> 05:16:29,000
leads to the station, which then leads to the sun station. And then the whole game is you've

1526
05:16:29,000 --> 05:16:50,500
completed the whole game. I'm going to head back there. The giant steep. I want to explore the

1527
05:16:50,500 --> 05:17:27,299
statue. Unknown. Still looking for whatever this is. The secret moon. Still have to go back there

1528
05:17:27,299 --> 05:17:39,349
and look at stuff. All right. Let's land. You didn't turn the stone off. Stove up. We're going

1529
05:17:39,349 --> 05:17:48,939
to space. Sorry. Back going so fast. I almost got dumped. Good. All right. Let's find where's

1530
05:17:48,939 --> 05:18:00,119
that little island again? Statue Island. That's right here. Slow down a little. That's actually

1531
05:18:00,119 --> 05:18:11,509
not it. Something else. Something else. I'm going to check it out. So many things to look at.

1532
05:18:11,509 --> 05:18:30,250
Here's the question. Let's go downstairs. Now this is what I saw in there. There's dead bodies

1533
05:18:30,250 --> 05:18:42,520
here. All right. The tornado is giants deep. That's that symbol. If you were holding this.

1534
05:18:43,240 --> 05:18:54,860
This is it. We finished building the final orbital probe cannon module and are ready to send it into

1535
05:18:54,860 --> 05:19:01,909
orbit around giant steep for assembly. The next step would be to send privet up to the orbit of

1536
05:19:01,909 --> 05:19:08,340
probe cannon to install the probe tracking system. All my friends here at the construction yard,

1537
05:19:08,340 --> 05:19:14,020
which is here, my gratitude for your tireless work. I've given up hope, but I truly believe

1538
05:19:14,020 --> 05:19:20,279
this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not. I know my brother

1539
05:19:20,279 --> 05:19:24,680
Avans and his spells will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible and where the

1540
05:19:24,680 --> 05:19:31,180
cannon would break under the station. I propose we give Avans and Malo a slightly lower maximum

1541
05:19:31,180 --> 05:19:35,020
power setting than the absolute maximum possible to create room for their enthusiasm.

1542
05:19:36,139 --> 05:19:42,540
Not on the same page. Are you going gelatinous on us, love? I'm delighted by your words,

1543
05:19:42,540 --> 05:19:49,220
but they're atypical for you. Ever half as gooey as Malo and Avans behave together,

1544
05:19:49,220 --> 05:19:56,150
Daz. I mean, launch me from the orbital probe cannon. We know this is the construction yard.

1545
05:19:57,110 --> 05:19:58,150
That much is certain.

1546
05:20:37,110 --> 05:21:01,000
I don't like this. I want office to ride as soon as possible. What's happening? It's a twister.

1547
05:21:01,799 --> 05:21:11,220
I'm safe. You know, there's probably only, I get it. I get it somehow.

1548
05:21:13,299 --> 05:21:19,619
When you go up in the air, it's your opportunity to fly somewhere else you cannot get under any

1549
05:21:19,619 --> 05:21:28,919
of the circumstances. Long range probe successfully launched from the orbital probe cannon.

1550
05:21:30,919 --> 05:21:43,049
We've got bad news. Yaro says there was a problem with the proposed power source,

1551
05:21:43,049 --> 05:21:46,330
so the orbital probe cannon won't be asked to fire.

1552
05:21:47,529 --> 05:21:50,500
People following my locomotive ring? Yeah, this is the, we saw this.

1553
05:21:51,459 --> 05:21:54,740
Burned from the cannon. My spells never remain at the construction yard.

1554
05:21:55,540 --> 05:21:59,049
Wish I were my friend, but no, they certainly didn't do the problem.

1555
05:22:00,009 --> 05:22:02,169
Yeah, so this was where we have the building.

1556
05:22:06,729 --> 05:22:23,349
So another person's house. Yes, but we can do this. That brings us over here.

1557
05:22:24,389 --> 05:22:48,069
What is this? Why is it still picking up the guy from 12 million meters away doing the harmonica?

1558
05:22:49,189 --> 05:23:03,529
There's a crystal here as well. I could do that after this. All right, I'm gonna,

1559
05:23:04,889 --> 05:23:08,819
I'm gonna make the jump over here when we go up.

1560
05:23:10,459 --> 05:23:25,220
Right now, I could use this for a second. I could walk it. Yeah, I could just walk it, couldn't I?

1561
05:23:26,020 --> 05:24:09,860
I detected. Thanks for the oxygen. Can I make this jump on the other side?

1562
05:24:09,860 --> 05:24:14,630
Anything back there? There it is. Discs.

1563
05:24:15,430 --> 05:24:22,060
Now I gotta bring this disc out to the other side and play the movie.

1564
05:24:23,020 --> 05:24:36,389
I can have one of those somewhere around here. All right, bring it back to the other side.

1565
05:24:37,189 --> 05:24:57,770
Guys, let's go. Movie night.

1566
05:25:08,700 --> 05:25:15,560
How would I go through the water? I don't know. I did though, didn't I?

1567
05:25:16,869 --> 05:25:19,029
All right, new conversation. What is it?

1568
05:25:46,860 --> 05:25:51,180
Fire constructed a model of giants deep here at the Brittle Hollow's Southern Observatory.

1569
05:25:54,040 --> 05:25:57,159
And it reveals how an object might sink below the current.

1570
05:25:59,509 --> 05:26:02,630
I'm unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool.

1571
05:26:02,630 --> 05:26:04,950
If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?

1572
05:26:06,229 --> 05:26:09,349
If you don't mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole,

1573
05:26:09,349 --> 05:26:13,349
I'd be delighted to see you. The trailhead starts at Brittle Hollow's equator.

1574
05:26:14,069 --> 05:26:19,540
I don't know. You should have seen it.

1575
05:26:19,540 --> 05:26:21,939
We thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink,

1576
05:26:21,939 --> 05:26:24,740
even for us to look below the current. But I sank straight to the core.

1577
05:26:25,779 --> 05:26:50,419
Interesting. This looks like that place I need to go.

1578
05:26:51,139 --> 05:27:00,180
Cool. All right. Well, now I got some data and now I'm going to move.

1579
05:27:00,819 --> 05:27:14,819
That's right. I'm going to go check that out. Walk across the top.

1580
05:27:15,700 --> 05:27:25,290
Let's do that. Cool. What is that? I think we're about to go in space.

1581
05:27:30,630 --> 05:27:32,970
Why is that active now? Why are these active?

1582
05:27:33,610 --> 05:27:36,520
Hold on a second. These are now activated.

1583
05:27:46,619 --> 05:27:57,159
Stasis machines? All right. I'm going back to the ship.

1584
05:27:57,959 --> 05:28:05,299
I don't know why I'm bringing this with me, but I guess I am.

1585
05:28:05,299 --> 05:28:13,990
The instruction here connects to the Southern Observatory,

1586
05:28:13,990 --> 05:28:15,430
which connects to ocean depths.

1587
05:28:16,310 --> 05:28:23,659
Not something to sink beneath the underwater current,

1588
05:28:23,659 --> 05:28:25,180
which they previously thought was impossible.

1589
05:28:27,060 --> 05:28:32,599
Southern Observatory. Brittle's Hollow's south pole.

1590
05:28:33,400 --> 05:28:39,779
The observatory, yeah, it's broken.

1591
05:28:40,740 --> 05:28:46,220
The model of giants deep that revealed how an object might sink below the strong current.

1592
05:28:46,779 --> 05:28:50,459
So I can't get in here. I have to go through the secret entrance.

1593
05:28:52,139 --> 05:29:01,659
There's all this shit down here too. Sun station.

1594
05:29:04,180 --> 05:29:08,860
They debated building a sun station. Wait a minute.

1595
05:29:14,060 --> 05:29:24,279
You built a station on the sun. Let's go look.

1596
05:29:29,979 --> 05:29:51,000
If you did, then you did, right? What's going on?

1597
05:29:51,000 --> 05:30:04,200
Why am I rotating? Okay. I finally escaped.

1598
05:30:06,500 --> 05:30:13,659
Sun station. Can I get close enough to the sun to find this?

1599
05:30:14,459 --> 05:30:28,939
I mean, I guess it looks like there's something right here.

1600
05:30:30,139 --> 05:30:37,529
Or is that just flames? This might just be flames.

1601
05:30:44,869 --> 05:30:53,080
I guess it just sucked me in. It just inhaled me.

1602
05:31:00,759 --> 05:31:01,959
It's going too fast.

1603
05:31:04,900 --> 05:31:15,990
Shit. We're going 300 meters a second and it didn't slow down.

1604
05:31:15,990 --> 05:31:26,180
I mean, I was holding the back button. I'm going to try. The sun is small now.

1605
05:31:26,740 --> 05:31:31,099
Let's try it now. Sun station.

1606
05:31:31,819 --> 05:31:37,290
I don't think there's anything on there. Maybe it's just barely off the surface.

1607
05:31:42,470 --> 05:32:02,119
Go to the sun at night when it's not hot. Yeah, you're right. That's not a bad idea.

1608
05:32:09,779 --> 05:32:15,939
That scared the fucking shit out of me. That scared the shit out of me.

1609
05:32:17,139 --> 05:32:22,819
What? Oh my God. There was no way in my brain that that was going to happen.

1610
05:32:23,860 --> 05:33:03,740
Okay. I mean, I don't see anything. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's that?

1611
05:33:04,860 --> 05:33:10,779
What is that? Wait, wait, wait, wait. There's something orbiting.

1612
05:33:10,779 --> 05:33:14,599
What is that? What's that? Sun station?

1613
05:33:22,500 --> 05:33:28,619
That's going way too up. I can't land on that. Are you kidding me?

1614
05:33:29,259 --> 05:33:40,169
I'm on fire. You can and you will.

1615
05:33:41,049 --> 05:34:00,919
Where is it? Man, I'm trying to pull up. I'm sucked in. I'm trying to just like kind of float.

1616
05:34:00,919 --> 05:34:16,360
That's moving so fast. So I have to match that. It's super hard to land on it.

1617
05:34:17,180 --> 05:34:21,020
I'll try it one more time, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.

1618
05:34:22,380 --> 05:34:30,950
I'll give it a try. I have to be going with it, not against it.

1619
05:34:31,830 --> 05:34:36,069
At least I know where it is. Maybe I should just ditch the...

1620
05:34:36,790 --> 05:35:02,840
No, that's not going to work. Okay. There it is. I need to be going along with it.

1621
05:35:02,840 --> 05:35:10,840
We have to spin this way. I'm going to slow down and I'm going to be moving with the bad

1622
05:35:10,840 --> 05:35:24,840
things of orbit. I prefer to come back so I can tell what the hell it's doing.

1623
05:35:25,880 --> 05:35:35,659
Kerbal space program? No, I try to play Kerbal space program. I uninstall the game after 15 minutes.

1624
05:35:36,459 --> 05:35:48,819
There it is. All right. Am I going to start burning here? Yep. Oh, fuck. Up, up, up, up, up,

1625
05:35:48,819 --> 05:36:06,090
up, up, up, up. Please. Am I going to land on this thing? No way. No way. You can't do this shit.

1626
05:36:08,540 --> 05:36:37,049
I'm going to have to crash into the thing. Where is it? Where is it? Where'd it go? I just circled

1627
05:36:37,049 --> 05:36:44,569
the damn thing like a full time. Oh, come on. It was right behind me. Oh, God. Damn you. Damn you.

1628
05:36:45,529 --> 05:37:01,430
This is hard. I can't really park either because I'm going to get sucked into the orbit. I just

1629
05:37:01,430 --> 05:37:11,979
have to try to stay up. I'm trying to... I'm just holding right trigger right now. Just skim like

1630
05:37:11,979 --> 05:37:20,340
this and then wait for it. No, it's just so hard to tell how much you're moving. I'm holding down

1631
05:37:20,340 --> 05:37:24,979
left trigger right now. I'm holding it as hard as I can. I have no idea even where I am.

1632
05:37:25,939 --> 05:37:48,759
That's seriously fucking insanely... I don't think I can do that.

1633
05:37:53,299 --> 05:38:16,470
Speed around the sun? It's pulling you down. Too much math. Too dangerous.

1634
05:38:17,830 --> 05:38:21,110
I'm going to try this one more time. I'm just going to speed along the surface of the sun.

1635
05:38:21,110 --> 05:38:36,409
While I hold right trigger. Space is just so disorienting. For instance, I just put that on

1636
05:38:36,409 --> 05:38:49,430
the sun. I have no idea where it is. Oh, there it is. All right. I'm going for it. Maybe I should

1637
05:38:49,430 --> 05:39:05,990
just crash into it. It's the big orange thing. All right. Well, let me see where the trajectory is.

1638
05:39:09,020 --> 05:39:27,509
I'm apparently still going too fast. There it is. All right. If I just hold down right...

1639
05:39:28,310 --> 05:39:33,669
I'm holding down forward right now. I'm just speeding forward. I just got launched out.

1640
05:39:34,549 --> 05:39:47,080
I don't think you're supposed to do this like this. You probably teleport onto this thing.

1641
05:39:48,439 --> 05:39:55,110
You definitely teleport from a different location onto this. There's no way this is what you're

1642
05:39:55,110 --> 05:40:11,750
supposed to do. No way. Because even if I catch up to it... All right. What's going on? I'm

1643
05:40:11,750 --> 05:40:16,229
fucking holding down right trigger right now. I'm holding right trigger. What? What?

1644
05:40:17,029 --> 05:40:20,069
All right. I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore. I'll teleport into the fucking thing like I'm

1645
05:40:20,069 --> 05:40:27,689
supposed to do in like three hours. In like four and a half hours when I teleport to that station,

1646
05:40:27,689 --> 05:40:52,580
that's when we'll do it. Cool. I can't even like try to fly it along the coast of the sun.

1647
05:40:53,299 --> 05:40:57,060
I can't think of any more things that would be stupid to do as an astronaut.

1648
05:40:59,990 --> 05:41:03,590
No, why don't we just like skim the fucking surface of the sun, Greg?

1649
05:41:04,470 --> 05:41:20,250
That's a good idea. Oh, don't worry. I'm a good pilot. I actually want to do...

1650
05:41:21,209 --> 05:41:49,459
Wait, let me... All right. The sand place. All right. Energy lab. All right. Yeah. I wanted to

1651
05:41:49,459 --> 05:41:56,599
do this. I want to go to the statue place. Where's that statue? Did I already do it? No,

1652
05:41:56,599 --> 05:42:11,779
no, no, no. I got sidetracked. Where is it? Six location. My energy lab. There. Statue workshop.

1653
05:42:12,580 --> 05:42:20,630
All right. I want to go back to Statue Island. And that's on that tornado planet. Cool.

1654
05:42:34,630 --> 05:42:41,349
I just took my eyes off the road. That was not... No, it's my controller. What the fuck?

1655
05:42:43,139 --> 05:42:55,450
Okay. Why is this happening again? I fixed this shit already. Give me a break, man.

1656
05:42:56,250 --> 05:43:14,569
Why did I get... Good start. Just like looking at my watch. Fucking goodness. Okay. Yeah. I think

1657
05:43:14,569 --> 05:43:17,529
I'm using the... I think I'm using the cord that... Remember I told you that I was having problems

1658
05:43:17,529 --> 05:43:24,540
with my controller. I had to get a new cord. I think I'm using the old cord because there's

1659
05:43:26,439 --> 05:43:35,479
shit everywhere in this room. I think I've replaced the cord with the old cord.

1660
05:43:35,479 --> 05:43:56,459
Let's try this again. Bad craftsman blames his tools. Well, no, this is the equivalent of you

1661
05:43:56,459 --> 05:44:03,340
using a hammer and the hammer disappears out of your hand while you're about to swing into a nail

1662
05:44:03,340 --> 05:44:28,700
and you punch yourself in the dick. What? Quantum hammer. That was funny. Quantum hammer was funny.

1663
05:44:28,700 --> 05:44:33,419
All right. I got to pay attention. Stop, stop. I'm going too fast. How am I going this fast? How am

1664
05:44:33,419 --> 05:44:49,819
I going this fast? Okay. Statue Island. Quantum idiot. Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough,

1665
05:44:49,900 --> 05:44:55,639
enough, enough. I'll take your position into consideration.

1666
05:45:06,020 --> 05:45:23,340
There's one person in chat who knows what that was. Nice, nice Qbert reference. Thanks, man.

1667
05:45:24,139 --> 05:45:33,959
I love Qbert. By the way, Qbert got a real diverse shit end of the stick, didn't he?

1668
05:45:35,799 --> 05:45:42,500
Statue works at heart. Nobody gives a shit about Qbert. He is one of the original classic video

1669
05:45:42,500 --> 05:45:47,939
game characters and Mega Man's talked about every day. Pac-Man's talked about all the time.

1670
05:45:48,819 --> 05:45:52,340
Mario's every like, what happened to Qbert? Why does nobody like Qbert? Why Qbert not like

1671
05:45:52,340 --> 05:45:59,060
his show up in anything? I think the only time Qbert's shown up in any new media is I think they

1672
05:45:59,060 --> 05:46:14,009
like punched him in the face and family guy because he swears. It's not even a real square.

1673
05:46:14,009 --> 05:46:21,560
It's like a comedy square. He's in a wreck at Ralph. Imagine your first real appearance

1674
05:46:22,819 --> 05:46:43,110
in two, three decades. He's on Wreck-It Ralph. All right, let's open up the... Now I got a minute.

1675
05:46:43,669 --> 05:46:50,630
Let's read this because I didn't get to read this whole thing last time. Henry's statues. Yeah,

1676
05:46:50,630 --> 05:46:57,590
but what if we didn't use the other, the door and snuck in the other way? Does anyone want to?

1677
05:46:58,630 --> 05:47:05,669
He said don't do that. Really want to see the test too, Lanny, but that's a huge risk we take. We

1678
05:47:05,669 --> 05:47:23,540
probably shouldn't maybe walk, so let us see a later test. Shit. All right, there's a way over

1679
05:47:23,540 --> 05:47:40,759
there. Door's broken, but there's another way to go. But where is that other way? Fuck, Qbert.

1680
05:47:50,840 --> 05:48:00,580
What are some of the video game characters that really should have followed into

1681
05:48:01,459 --> 05:48:20,659
this current popular culture but never did? Frogger? Yeah, Frogger was another one, isn't it?

1682
05:48:20,659 --> 05:48:23,939
Oh wait, wait a minute. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do. I know what to do.

1683
05:48:23,939 --> 05:48:48,490
Look. Where is it? Find it. Where's the secret entrance? Oh shit, we're going down. That's the

1684
05:48:48,490 --> 05:49:26,680
right idea though. That's the right idea. Got it. All right, what about uh, this thing? Wait, how

1685
05:49:26,680 --> 05:49:41,029
much further down is this? I can find distress beacons too? Shit. This is nuts. Yara, would you

1686
05:49:41,029 --> 05:49:46,150
kindly step back so Daz is closest to the statue? When pairing, the statue will choose whoever is

1687
05:49:46,150 --> 05:49:54,090
in closest proximity. See how its eyes have opened? That tells us the statue is paired with Daz.

1688
05:49:54,970 --> 05:50:01,369
Now, no matter where he is in this star system, Daz's statue will record his memories and send

1689
05:50:01,369 --> 05:50:12,860
them to the Ash Twin Project. This is extraordinary sculpting work, Vox. He has outdone himself again,

1690
05:50:12,860 --> 05:50:18,220
hasn't he? And now that we have our first successful pairing, we can test my memory storage

1691
05:50:18,220 --> 05:50:25,830
prototype. Each statue will send a single Nomai's memories to his or her own storage unit

1692
05:50:26,630 --> 05:50:34,860
within the Ash Twin. Each storage unit will be equipped with a mask, the statue's counterpart,

1693
05:50:35,659 --> 05:50:39,900
which will be able to send those stored memories back to the corresponding Nomai.

1694
05:50:39,900 --> 05:50:58,500
What the heck, dude? So I have, I have like a USB drive on the Ash Twin. Is this supposed to be me?

1695
05:50:59,220 --> 05:51:09,020
Okay, so we go from my brain, it sees me, it sees everything that I've done in every set and done,

1696
05:51:09,819 --> 05:51:26,119
and puts it onto the cloud, just like Google does. This is all for ad tracking. Okay, so I gotta find

1697
05:51:26,439 --> 05:51:32,619
the, on the Ash Twin. Now I know, I have my own personal USB drive on the Ash Twin. This just got

1698
05:51:32,619 --> 05:51:46,840
way more interesting right now. Right now I'm sitting there going, oh fuck, I gotta get there,

1699
05:51:46,840 --> 05:51:50,919
I gotta get there so I can delete all the times I went to the bathroom. I don't want to be seeing

1700
05:51:50,919 --> 05:52:04,540
that. I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin Project, but the only plus two I got for that one

1701
05:52:04,540 --> 05:52:10,659
was from VR Josh. Everybody else did minus twos. That was a lot of minus twos in a row. Yeah,

1702
05:52:11,459 --> 05:52:24,069
all right, fine. Jeremiah, has anyone ever told you that you look like, you look like

1703
05:52:24,069 --> 05:52:32,650
Jeremy Albertson? That's me. All right, I've installed the masks inside the Ash Twin Project.

1704
05:52:33,209 --> 05:52:38,229
They look beautiful, although I do feel as though I'm being observed. It's comforting to know the

1705
05:52:38,229 --> 05:52:43,909
statues will not pair until the project succeeds, otherwise I imagine the experience would be hard

1706
05:52:43,909 --> 05:52:51,060
to endure. Ideally, they'll only need to activate once the project succeeds as a safety measure.

1707
05:52:51,060 --> 05:52:58,180
However, the statues will also activate in the event of the equipment failure. They will? Why

1708
05:52:58,180 --> 05:53:05,290
is that? If anything goes wrong with the Ash Twin Project, the statues and their masks will make us

1709
05:53:05,290 --> 05:53:10,009
aware of the situation and enable us to fix it. Otherwise, it would be possible for us to remain

1710
05:53:10,009 --> 05:53:15,479
permanently unaware of the problem. I hadn't thought of that. What a profoundly horrific fate

1711
05:53:15,479 --> 05:53:40,169
that would be. We're gonna store our, is there one of those things? This. Wait, every time I die,

1712
05:53:40,169 --> 05:54:00,220
I see this. And we fly through one of the holes. Okay, so those are the USB drives then. What's

1713
05:54:00,220 --> 05:54:15,560
up there? I can open this. On the other side. Hey, cool. All right, there's something else up here.

1714
05:54:16,439 --> 05:54:29,770
Okay, I thought, hear me out on this. This is gonna be hard maybe for me to describe or for you to see,

1715
05:54:30,729 --> 05:54:36,630
but that's a person with an astronaut helmet on with two arms sticking out and two legs.

1716
05:54:36,709 --> 05:54:41,189
That's a scout. And I was just like, there's a person here. This is, I gotta talk to the scout.

1717
05:54:43,020 --> 05:54:51,000
Ready? Left arm is right here. Right arm is right here. Hold on, let me do this from the mouse.

1718
05:54:52,599 --> 05:54:59,349
Right arm right here. Left arm right here. There's the head. There's like the end of the helmet.

1719
05:55:01,220 --> 05:55:17,979
Left leg, right leg. You're a psycho. I have to be a psycho every time. I wanna get up there.

1720
05:55:17,979 --> 05:55:40,650
I wanna get up there. I wanna get up there. Oh, this is how to get up there.

1721
05:55:42,009 --> 05:56:02,950
Read it. I'm curious, is sending a being's memories back in time the same as sending

1722
05:56:02,950 --> 05:56:11,130
the being itself back in time? As an example, if we were to send my memories back in time,

1723
05:56:11,130 --> 05:56:18,380
is that the same as sending me back in time? I imagine they're two different actions.

1724
05:56:19,099 --> 05:56:23,900
Wouldn't both actions be effectively the same?

1725
05:56:29,459 --> 05:56:35,270
Suppose that time was being rewritten. I believe this is different than receiving memories from

1726
05:56:35,270 --> 05:56:41,479
what is effectively the future. But isn't the end result identical in either case?

1727
05:56:53,689 --> 05:57:02,599
So they're sending memories back, but not a person? Does that make sense? Get out of here.

1728
05:57:03,240 --> 05:57:39,930
My leg. It's because it's quantum. Right, I forgot. What? Oxygen. Let's dump it into the computer.

1729
05:57:41,450 --> 05:57:54,139
Statue Workshop brings us over to Ash Twin Project. Every memory recorded by a

1730
05:57:54,139 --> 05:58:00,810
Nomai statue is transmitted to a corresponding storage unit within Ash Twin. I think that,

1731
05:58:00,810 --> 05:58:18,310
look at how big that one is. This is a mystery one. All right, let's go. Ash Twin. Ash Twin

1732
05:58:18,310 --> 05:58:32,090
Project. Okay. Right, right, right, right. Let's see. Okay. Where is it? Ash Twin. See, Jar Jar is the

1733
05:58:33,509 --> 05:58:52,490
whole thing here. Where is it? Ash Twin. Did I get it? Jar Jar is the key doll. It's at the

1734
05:58:52,490 --> 05:59:10,520
line problem. What did I say? What did I say? What did I say? Jar Jar is the whole thing.

1735
05:59:15,020 --> 05:59:21,930
Jar Jar is the whole thing here. Okay. Nobody just said this is the longest dream we've ever had.

1736
05:59:22,569 --> 05:59:31,700
Um, don't, I do not think so. No, there's been six hours. The longest dream was about 13 and a half.

1737
05:59:31,700 --> 05:59:42,790
All right, engaging autopilot. Let's go. Not even the longest dream this week. Yeah, yesterday was

1738
05:59:42,790 --> 05:59:47,819
like eight and a half, seven and a half. All right, go to Ash Twin and let's go. I want to go to the

1739
05:59:47,819 --> 06:00:03,049
USB storage. Okay, stop autopilot. I'm going to get the sun. Sun time. Sun time. Sun time. No,

1740
06:00:03,049 --> 06:00:35,700
it's not sun time. Hi. What's going on? Um, what's happening? Um, just get over there.

1741
06:00:38,229 --> 06:00:51,110
Dude can't even fall into the sun right. Shaking my fucking head. All the inertia.

1742
06:00:59,029 --> 06:01:06,069
When you're going 600 miles a second, you can't instantly start going the opposite direction.

1743
06:01:09,830 --> 06:01:15,430
Uh, but why is it doing this? I'm, I'm holding buttons to the right. I swear to God,

1744
06:01:15,430 --> 06:01:22,220
this is not, I swear to God, I'm doing, I'm, I'm not doing this. I'm holding the fucking button,

1745
06:01:22,220 --> 06:01:43,419
man. I'm going way too fast. I'm holding back. Okay, we're going to find them.

1746
06:01:46,500 --> 06:01:55,430
Okay, slow down and land. All right, good. Nice. Okay, get the fuck out of here.

1747
06:01:58,340 --> 06:02:11,029
We're looking for this place, place here somewhere on this planet.

1748
06:02:11,909 --> 06:02:35,509
It's the massive, it's a USB room. What's that over there? Oh, I can't get into any of these.

1749
06:02:43,509 --> 06:03:01,939
Wait here. It's connecting me necessarily. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for.

1750
06:03:12,040 --> 06:03:15,240
This is the only thing I've been able to find here. This shit.

1751
06:03:16,200 --> 06:03:40,950
But this doesn't really lead me anywhere. It's a bridge. Unless there's a sound cave shard

1752
06:03:40,950 --> 06:04:02,409
down there. This thing's getting too big. Stress beam unknown. I'm like, look, this is

1753
06:04:03,369 --> 06:04:17,750
I've never been in here. Look at that. Found something. Here's our first delivery.

1754
06:04:18,549 --> 06:04:25,130
One warp core fresh from the black hole forge. Rude is installing this core sibling on Brittle

1755
06:04:25,130 --> 06:04:31,610
Hollow as I write this. I gratitude Larry, but this the Ashtman project is underway.

1756
06:04:32,569 --> 06:04:38,869
I confess I'm deeply curious about what you and Pokey found on the white hole station that

1757
06:04:38,869 --> 06:04:45,909
started this project. I visit some time to learn more. I recommend you do. The white hole station

1758
06:04:45,909 --> 06:04:51,270
is the model for the towers being built. The Ashtman project. The visit to the station would

1759
06:04:51,270 --> 06:04:58,580
be doubly useful. I suppose more precisely, I would like to visit the white hole station with you,

1760
06:04:58,580 --> 06:05:05,819
Larry. I'd be happy to explain our findings. Here, stop using the scroll wall to flirt with my sister

1761
06:05:06,619 --> 06:05:13,500
and go meet her on the white hole station. I wish I could wait here for you to arrive,

1762
06:05:13,500 --> 06:05:23,689
but the forge and my unfinished work is calling on return with more materials soon. I needed to

1763
06:05:23,689 --> 06:05:32,650
learn. End of the stream song. I think that's, I really, really needed that info too, so that's

1764
06:05:32,650 --> 06:06:01,220
good. Now we just die. I have to watch it. I'm gonna be out of view. There it goes.

1765
06:06:06,650 --> 06:06:34,439
Then we fly through one of these masks, which is a USB slot. Then we go through some weird portal.

1766
06:06:35,400 --> 06:06:59,689
Our memories have been played to somebody. We go back in time. Memories have gone back in time.

1767
06:06:59,689 --> 06:07:11,669
We have shot the cannon. Okay, let's download this data. Dude, you keep dying. You suck at this game.

1768
06:07:14,810 --> 06:07:22,500
Yeah, I know. It's kind of tricky. I know what you mean, though. All right, what we got?

1769
06:07:22,500 --> 06:07:34,409
Ash Twin Towers. What we got? Ash Twin Towers. Black Hole Forge. White Hole Station Energy Lab.

1770
06:07:35,369 --> 06:07:43,130
Black Hole Station. No minecrafted warp cores at the Black Hole Forge before delivering them to Ash

1771
06:07:43,130 --> 06:07:54,869
Twin. All right, I gotta do this one. My energy lab in the canyon at Ember Twin's equator. In the

1772
06:07:54,869 --> 06:08:19,659
canyon. We gotta go now. Canyon at Ember Twin's equator. Nice to land on somebody. Turn off auto

1773
06:08:19,659 --> 06:08:42,360
pilot. You just killed the dude. No, I didn't. I did not. It's not true. I did not. All right,

1774
06:08:42,360 --> 06:08:48,090
abort, abort. It's right in the way. How do you not see this golf ball that's in the way?

1775
06:08:48,090 --> 06:08:55,220
Auto pilot. Stupid thing. All right, in the canyon. How does that look for a canyon?

1776
06:08:55,779 --> 06:09:08,099
How does that look? In here. Gotta get into the canyon. Quickly, hurry up before all the

1777
06:09:08,099 --> 06:09:25,619
sand fills the hole. All right, into the canyon. In here. Now, where in here is it? Sit. Sit.

1778
06:09:25,619 --> 06:09:40,840
Got something.

1779
06:10:14,250 --> 06:10:18,810
It happened in an instant without warning. I turned away from Cole's to examine a sample and

1780
06:10:18,810 --> 06:10:23,049
when I turned back he wasn't there. He had a limited supply of air. I'm afraid for him.

1781
06:10:24,009 --> 06:10:29,290
Hypothesis. We will learn more by examining the northern lakebed cave where he disappeared.

1782
06:10:29,290 --> 06:10:47,110
Search quickly. We have no time. I already knew that info, but okay. Air is here. Quantum shard.

1783
06:10:47,110 --> 06:11:17,669
Unidentified signal. Unknown. Wait, this is known. I've already been up here. How is this

1784
06:11:17,669 --> 06:11:37,080
unknown? I've talked to this person already. Church, I have a question for you. I found

1785
06:11:37,080 --> 06:11:46,650
something. I found Nomai writing about the quantum moon. I've observed the quantum moon orbiting each

1786
06:11:46,650 --> 06:11:49,770
of the five planets, but sometimes it quite simply disappears from the sky. Maybe there's another

1787
06:11:49,770 --> 06:11:58,360
place it travels to. Unfortunately, there is. I've never seen it. Quantum shirt. Quantum shard.

1788
06:11:58,360 --> 06:12:17,830
Okay, there you go. You got it. You got your comedy for a full hour. You still don't. I'm,

1789
06:12:17,830 --> 06:12:32,330
I gotta find something here. I don't know. Okay, I need, I already got that cave shard.

1790
06:12:33,209 --> 06:12:40,619
All right, we gotta go, we gotta go north. Up here, down in this way, right? In there.

1791
06:12:40,619 --> 06:12:54,500
Cave shard. All right, that's enough out of you guys for tonight. That's enough out of you guys.

1792
06:13:00,680 --> 06:13:13,529
All right, stop. The comedy meter is falling. Okay, there's, there's the cave shard.

1793
06:13:14,740 --> 06:13:33,430
That's death. Let's just keep going this way. Here's the cave shard. No, I just, okay,

1794
06:13:33,990 --> 06:13:44,279
cave shard. Police is missing. He vanished from the lake bed cave, the one at the bottom of the

1795
06:13:44,279 --> 06:13:49,430
dry lake bed at the north pole a couple days ago, and we're unable to find a trace of him.

1796
06:13:52,569 --> 06:13:59,020
I beg you, if you're reading this, help us. This rock is familiar to you to travel here,

1797
06:13:59,020 --> 06:14:02,220
my sedimentary friend, because your unique color and texture appear identical to the rock I met

1798
06:14:02,220 --> 06:14:06,729
earlier. Isn't this the rock fragment of the cave we found at the bottom of the dry lake bed at the

1799
06:14:06,729 --> 06:14:14,569
north pole? We plan to re-examine the north, northern lake bed cave. Wow. And Malera and I

1800
06:14:14,569 --> 06:14:17,849
went back to the lake bed cave and observed this rock again. Sometimes it's there and sometimes

1801
06:14:17,849 --> 06:14:23,130
it's not. Now that means this rock wanders like the quantum moon does. How curious. Very curious,

1802
06:14:23,130 --> 06:14:29,540
indeed. It's gone and therefore it's now in the top of the lake bed cave. Let's go.

1803
06:14:41,139 --> 06:15:04,680
North pole. This way. Like in here. In here. This is the big cave. This is so dark.

1804
06:15:05,880 --> 06:15:12,520
I think I missed my opportunity. The sand is all here. Did I miss the opportunity?

1805
06:15:13,159 --> 06:15:33,560
I might have. I have an opportunity here. The lake bed cave. It's down there. The sand's covering

1806
06:15:33,560 --> 06:15:51,110
it. Might as well fly into the sun. Unless it's like here or something. No, it's definitely on

1807
06:15:51,110 --> 06:16:00,709
the bottom. Lake bed. I think I missed the opportunity. Definitely missed the opportunity

1808
06:16:00,709 --> 06:16:27,509
to do this. Oh well. Start shoveling. I guess I could go back to the quantum moon. It's right there.

1809
06:16:28,470 --> 06:16:43,529
All right. Percentage check. Percentage check of me getting to the end. Completing the game.

1810
06:16:43,529 --> 06:17:12,330
Percentage check. 20 percent. Not joking. 40 percent for sure. Like 45 percent. 40 percent. 35, 30, 40.

1811
06:17:14,490 --> 06:17:21,029
No, put the suit back on. All right. Where do I want to go?

1812
06:17:21,029 --> 06:17:45,139
Still shit to do. Let me look at the map. Ash twin project. I still have to do these cave things.

1813
06:17:46,970 --> 06:17:56,569
Lake bed cave. Dry lake bed. All right. Let's go. I'm doing that immediately today. I'm just

1814
06:17:56,569 --> 06:18:20,580
going to instantly kill myself here. Trying to ghost ride it. All right. We got to be quick.

1815
06:18:20,580 --> 06:18:36,220
We got to go right to the bottom of that lake bed cave. How I feel about the game so far. I'm

1816
06:18:36,220 --> 06:18:42,389
intrigued because I kind of want to know. I kind of want to unravel its mysteries.

1817
06:18:45,270 --> 06:18:52,200
I just want to know. All right. There's an air of mystery here that I would like to know

1818
06:18:52,200 --> 06:19:01,349
how it comes together. All right. It's a little puzzle that you put together in your brain.

1819
06:19:01,509 --> 06:19:32,599
Sounds cool. Wow. There's time. I'm going to go up.

1820
06:19:34,279 --> 06:19:45,509
I'm going right for the golf ball. I always just go too fast because I'm just

1821
06:19:46,069 --> 06:19:51,189
I go so fast. Go like seven trillion miles per hour and then I can't stop.

1822
06:19:52,459 --> 06:19:54,459
It's like a it's like if you were on a train trip.

1823
06:19:54,459 --> 06:20:04,250
Okay.

1824
06:20:45,689 --> 06:21:06,520
Jerma has to eat a ghost pepper. Get me up. Let's go. Just don't blow your speed out and go crazy.

1825
06:21:07,240 --> 06:21:49,939
Is it going behind or in front? All right. What the hell was I doing? Oh, the lake bed.

1826
06:21:49,939 --> 06:22:01,669
North pole lake bed. Yep. Don't you dare block me here. I don't even think about it.

1827
06:22:02,389 --> 06:22:46,459
It's going to block me. It's coming for me to block me. Asshole. Okay. Hurry up. Let's go into

1828
06:22:46,459 --> 06:23:11,180
the cave. North pole. Why did I not land on the south pole? Why? Here it is. Am I going fast?

1829
06:23:11,180 --> 06:23:25,020
Yeah. Kind of. Okay. All right. Here we are. Where is it? Cave? Looks like a cave. What the

1830
06:23:25,020 --> 06:24:02,580
fuck is this? Stress beacon. Beacon. Hide and seek. No. Where the hell am I? Um, cave shard is

1831
06:24:02,580 --> 06:24:21,779
over there. Stop showing me the moon. I don't care about the fucking moon. Is it right above me?

1832
06:24:22,419 --> 06:24:50,819
It's above me. Oh, I'm getting squished. Damn it. Was I in the right spot though? I

1833
06:24:51,540 --> 06:24:57,459
looked like it was above me. That was the worst sound. Yeah, that was a horrible noise.

1834
06:25:03,639 --> 06:25:32,259
I don't know how to do that. Hurry up and go faster. I mean, I can't go that fast.

1835
06:25:40,889 --> 06:25:56,490
I gotta go slow. I'm trying. Hurry up and go faster. Dude, I can't. I'm supposed to fly into the cave?

1836
06:25:57,770 --> 06:26:17,450
All right. Where is it? Where's the, where's the, where's the north pole? I don't know where,

1837
06:26:17,450 --> 06:26:21,369
I don't know what, what, what the north pole is. What's a landmark I can look for?

1838
06:26:22,330 --> 06:26:41,750
What the fuck? Just get the fuck out. North? Which way is north? I'm running the equation.

1839
06:26:41,750 --> 06:27:10,599
All right. Let's try this again. Get in here. All the way down. Where am I? Okay. Where am I?

1840
06:27:12,500 --> 06:27:43,299
Am I in? Keep going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. That above me. It's fucking above me.

1841
06:27:43,860 --> 06:28:12,700
It's above me. Where the fuck did I just end up? Wait, what? Where is this? Why is it? Dude, that

1842
06:28:19,459 --> 06:28:24,409
All right. I, it's so disorienting down there too. Did I miss the opportunity again?

1843
06:28:25,450 --> 06:28:37,180
Stop looking for the signal. This is the cave right here, but like, I understand. I'm just

1844
06:28:37,180 --> 06:28:45,159
looking for the signal. In case you're curious, 11,000 meters that way, there's a quantum moon.

1845
06:28:47,750 --> 06:29:00,069
It's anybody wanted to know. Oh, and 60,000 meters behind you. There's a, there's a beacon

1846
06:29:00,069 --> 06:29:18,569
somewhere over there. Just in case you wanted to know for your current objective. Signal doesn't

1847
06:29:18,569 --> 06:29:33,459
do anything. Just go. I feel like that shit happens so fast. You want to smash this game

1848
06:29:33,459 --> 06:29:43,930
from making, you want to smash this game from making that noise. So forget about the signal.

1849
06:29:43,930 --> 06:29:49,659
Just run in and just keep going in. But I keep hitting the wall. There's the, it's like blocked

1850
06:29:49,659 --> 06:30:02,220
two or three of those passages blocked. Think of the cave as a maze. You have to finish in

1851
06:30:02,220 --> 06:30:33,450
under two minutes. That doesn't sound like something I want to do. Where's that northern

1852
06:30:33,450 --> 06:30:41,590
section? Slow down. Let's go here. Is that north or is that south? I don't even know.

1853
06:30:42,389 --> 06:31:09,590
Do I have a compass anywhere? Get in here. Right there. Fuck it. Dude, I'm just flying the shit

1854
06:31:09,590 --> 06:31:23,990
in here. I don't give a shit. Let's go. I don't give a fuck. It explodes. Don't get crushed by

1855
06:31:23,990 --> 06:31:32,020
it. Don't get crushed by it. Don't get crushed by it. I'm in. I'm in. Am I in? I'm in. All right.

1856
06:31:32,020 --> 06:32:10,470
Left and then left. Left. Left. Right. Wrong. Right. Left. Right. Dead end. What the fuck?

1857
06:32:10,470 --> 06:32:17,779
I don't know. I get this tiny circle in the middle of my screen. I don't even know what

1858
06:32:17,779 --> 06:32:25,290
direction I'm facing right now. I don't know what direction I'm in. I think I'm outside again.

1859
06:32:26,700 --> 06:32:54,470
Where am I? Where's my flashlight pointing? What? Am I in? Did I make it? Am I in? Use the scout?

1860
06:33:03,610 --> 06:33:37,659
Where am I supposed to go from here? Crunch incoming. I can't fly right now. I just have

1861
06:33:37,659 --> 06:33:52,580
no idea where this even wants me to go. Am I supposed to go up this cave? Here? I mean,

1862
06:33:52,580 --> 06:34:17,750
that's what I'm trying to do. Fuck. Am I in? Am I? I'm trying to stand on this.

1863
06:34:27,799 --> 06:34:41,689
Can I not stand on this? How did I not land on that? God damn it, man. Give me a break.

1864
06:34:50,220 --> 06:35:12,979
It's pushing me off. What the fuck is going on right now? Did I do it? If I go out this,

1865
06:35:12,979 --> 06:35:47,939
am I going to die? What? I can't go this way. Fuck this maze bullshit. Quantum fucking maze.

1866
06:35:49,049 --> 06:36:24,950
What? I'm losing my goddamn mind. Are these teleporting behind me? I don't even know what

1867
06:36:24,950 --> 06:36:36,680
direction I'm in. Wrong, wrong, but is it wrong? What the fuck are you doing to me? This is

1868
06:36:36,680 --> 06:36:41,400
ridiculous. I don't know what to do. Am I going crazy or is this happening to you?

1869
06:36:44,040 --> 06:36:49,799
I'm going crazy. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Okay, don't. Wait, don't. All right. All

1870
06:36:49,799 --> 06:37:02,970
right. That's not cool. What do I do? Turn. Motherfucker. I figured it out. Now what do I do?

1871
06:37:21,209 --> 06:37:42,459
Turn. Get out. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I'm almost out of oxygen.

1872
06:37:45,159 --> 06:37:55,750
I did it. If you come here to look for Coleus, this is where we vanished. He's been missing

1873
06:37:55,750 --> 06:38:02,860
for two days. What happened before Coleus disappeared? We were examining the different

1874
06:38:02,860 --> 06:38:08,060
rocks. I recall Coleus standing on the largest one, the wandering rock. I was taking notes and

1875
06:38:08,060 --> 06:38:17,130
then my lantern died. I lit it again. Coleus and the rock were both gone. Your strange wandering

1876
06:38:17,130 --> 06:38:22,919
rock friend is here, though Coleus isn't. Coleus and I observed this unusual looking rock shard

1877
06:38:24,389 --> 06:38:28,790
in at least two other caverns. I'm unsure if this is relevant. I thought I was going crazy.

1878
06:38:29,270 --> 06:38:36,419
I looked over at the chat and people were like, dude, what are you nuts? You fucking just walk

1879
06:38:36,419 --> 06:38:40,500
straight. What's wrong with you? I'm like, what's wrong with me? I'm like, what's wrong with me?

1880
06:38:40,500 --> 06:38:45,180
Something's wrong with me. What's wrong with me? I thought I was going insane.

1881
06:38:46,060 --> 06:39:01,479
It was like, dude, are you fucking serious? Get a grip, man. What's wrong with you? What are you

1882
06:39:01,479 --> 06:39:52,490
doing? All right. Well, there's the cave shard. Do I move this thing? How do I? I can go. Hold on.

1883
06:39:52,490 --> 06:40:27,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Let me do it. How curious this rock took me with it to a new

1884
06:40:27,610 --> 06:40:34,169
location. I wonder why this happened. Curious, but also alarming. This new cave appears to lack an

1885
06:40:34,169 --> 06:40:38,330
entrance or exit. Also, the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn't watching.

1886
06:40:38,889 --> 06:40:46,139
The wandering rock has returned. Never before have I seen been so delighted to see a sedimentary

1887
06:40:46,139 --> 06:40:53,900
specimen. I wonder if I myself become quantum briefly when the rock carried me here. This seems

1888
06:40:53,900 --> 06:41:01,159
the clearest explanation. If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out. I can travel

1889
06:41:01,159 --> 06:41:05,400
on this rock as long as I'm not observing my surroundings, meaning I must be in complete

1890
06:41:05,400 --> 06:41:14,020
darkness. I'm going to bring my mentor here to see this. Malory is here now too. We theorize when a

1891
06:41:14,020 --> 06:41:18,099
conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to act as an observer,

1892
06:41:18,740 --> 06:41:23,590
the being can become entangled with that quantum object and they'd move together.

1893
06:41:26,599 --> 06:41:38,659
Friends, Coleus has discovered a new quantum rule. Wasn't there another one of these down

1894
06:41:38,659 --> 06:41:55,080
here somewhere? There was another one, wasn't there? It's the same one. No, I mean like in a

1895
06:41:55,080 --> 06:42:17,939
different cave. This is the same one. Oh, it's just the same. I think I did everything I can.

1896
06:42:18,580 --> 06:42:45,540
Turn the lights on. Wait, hold on. Can I go more? Can I do more? Wait, it does go to another place,

1897
06:42:45,540 --> 06:43:12,740
doesn't it? Okay, this is the one I was just in. Oh, shit. Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus,

1898
06:43:12,740 --> 06:43:22,180
I implore you to tell me. Ah, this is where that is. Yeah, we've read this already. So,

1899
06:43:22,180 --> 06:43:25,540
you're telling me I could have just stood on this rock and turned the lights off and I would have

1900
06:43:25,540 --> 06:43:32,099
been able to just not have to do the streamer, you're going crazy, like what's wrong with you

1901
06:43:32,099 --> 06:43:46,470
segment? I felt so sad too. I was getting so sad and almost upset and angry with myself because

1902
06:43:46,470 --> 06:43:49,990
I keep seeing like people saying, stop pretending and shit. I'm just like, am I?

1903
06:43:50,709 --> 06:43:58,970
I don't think I am. Am I pretending to not know where to go? I was just like, what happened? How

1904
06:43:58,970 --> 06:44:12,389
do I not know this? Well, all right, I got that mystery solved. So then hold on. If I go on the

1905
06:44:12,389 --> 06:44:51,220
moon, that means that if I turn all the lights off, I can go to the secret moon spot. Why do

1906
06:44:51,220 --> 06:44:58,790
you let chat bully you so much? I don't. I usually, hey, half the time I'm like, hey, shut up. What

1907
06:44:58,790 --> 06:45:02,520
you guys think you are? But I thought I was actually something wrong with me there.

1908
06:45:20,919 --> 06:45:26,520
Don't let this affect you like that. I mean, I was in the, you're losing your mind part of the game.

1909
06:45:28,040 --> 06:45:33,639
No, it's all good. Don't worry. I know you guys aren't really trying to make me think

1910
06:45:33,639 --> 06:45:41,849
them. Well, maybe some of you are. All right, put it in the computer. Cave.

1911
06:45:42,979 --> 06:45:54,810
On quantum moon locator. Sixth location. Quantum moon disappears sometimes.

1912
06:45:54,810 --> 06:46:26,330
Well, what do you know? Quantum moon time. Quantum moon right there. Where is it?

1913
06:46:28,459 --> 06:46:57,639
Where's quantum moon? So you're telling me that all I have to do is close my eyes.

1914
06:46:58,599 --> 06:47:09,500
And well, we'd like to not go that fast. So I'm going to close my eyes on this moon.

1915
06:47:09,500 --> 06:47:27,740
I don't understand. I don't understand what happened.

1916
06:47:42,659 --> 06:47:46,099
All right, I'm going to make a comparison here to something.

1917
06:47:46,099 --> 06:47:50,650
And a lot of you guys are going to know what I'm talking about. I remember when I played Darkwood

1918
06:47:50,650 --> 06:47:56,169
and I stepped in a trap every like four and a half minutes. And it got to a point where everybody was

1919
06:47:56,169 --> 06:48:00,090
certain that I was doing it on purpose. They actually believed it. I was like, dude, there's

1920
06:48:00,090 --> 06:48:03,450
no way you're doing that. You have to be doing that. You've stepped in like 30 traps.

1921
06:48:04,409 --> 06:48:10,470
The sun is just a trap from Darkwood. It's just, it just keeps happening. There's nothing I can do

1922
06:48:10,470 --> 06:48:23,340
about it. OK, quantum moon. I want to try this theory out. Where is the damn thing?

1923
06:48:31,220 --> 06:48:53,939
Percentage check. And we're around 40 to 50, 50, 40 to 50 ish, 50 to 60, 40, 50. Really? All right.

1924
06:48:53,939 --> 06:49:09,860
Is this what we're doing tomorrow? I want to make sure there's enough to do a full stream on this

1925
06:49:09,860 --> 06:49:21,319
tomorrow. It's been six and a half, seven hours. All right. So is there, those of you that are

1926
06:49:21,319 --> 06:49:35,319
experts, is there about six to six to eight hours left in the game? Yes, probably. Probably more

1927
06:49:35,319 --> 06:49:49,290
than that. For you, yes. Depends on how good you are. At least six to seven, six to nine. OK. All

1928
06:49:49,290 --> 06:50:19,029
right. Let's find that moon. The moon. Yeah, because I want to have a good six hour stream,

1929
06:50:19,029 --> 06:50:22,229
six to ten hour stream tomorrow. Like there's a six to eight hour stream tonight.

1930
06:50:23,029 --> 06:50:53,220
Depends on how fast you can solve things. OK, I got a photo. I need a note. All right, there we go.

1931
06:50:53,939 --> 06:51:16,250
We're on the, OK, now we're on the moon. Unbuckle. Let's get out. Now what and what do we do here?

1932
06:51:16,250 --> 06:51:25,479
Somebody's dead. Who is this? They have a mask on. They're wearing one of these masks. They're

1933
06:51:25,479 --> 06:51:33,419
wearing a memory. They're wearing a USB mask. Whatever that is. OK, so somebody's wearing a

1934
06:51:33,419 --> 06:52:00,919
USB mask here. OK, they're on the ground now. You landed on this guy. Let's not look. OK,

1935
06:52:00,919 --> 06:52:11,880
let's see what happens. He's just dead. OK, I don't want to waste any time. OK, any fluctuation?

1936
06:52:12,919 --> 06:52:25,590
Just on the moon. All right, so what am I looking for here? If I close my eyes, it will disappear.

1937
06:52:26,229 --> 06:53:27,689
Right? Wait, this moved. It's dark in here. It's dark in here. Now what? New planet? This is ice

1938
06:53:27,689 --> 06:53:53,849
planet. Flood. Wait, no, this is the this is that is this I think I've ever been here.

1939
06:53:54,409 --> 06:54:12,889
Isn't this this like the tentacle planet, right? I want to go to that one. I've not been to that

1940
06:54:12,889 --> 06:55:16,310
one yet. I've seen all these elements, but not this one. OK, we're here. OK, well, bye.

1941
06:55:17,270 --> 06:55:27,509
Quantum imaging, quantum entanglement, rule of the sixth location.

1942
06:56:16,819 --> 06:56:46,409
Shit, what is this one? Quantum now.

1943
06:56:48,889 --> 06:57:07,779
I don't know the third rule. I don't know the third rule. What's over here? Anything?

1944
06:57:08,740 --> 06:58:00,520
The sixth location rule. Where is that? Where's my where's my where's my rules?

1945
06:58:01,319 --> 06:58:14,729
I want to wear my rules. If you recall the rule of quantum imaging, quantum entanglement.

1946
06:58:15,849 --> 06:58:21,220
Let's go over the rules. Quantum imaging is as long as I have a picture of something,

1947
06:58:21,220 --> 06:58:26,580
as long as I can see something, it exists. But if I don't see something, it could exist somewhere

1948
06:58:26,580 --> 06:58:40,869
else. Quantum entanglement is I can ride on top of the rock, right? That's the you're entangled

1949
06:58:40,869 --> 06:58:54,700
in the quantum and you can move around the rule of the sixth location. This is the sixth location.

1950
06:58:54,700 --> 06:59:38,700
What's the rule of the sixth location? Turn lights up. Hold on. I need to be able to stand in it.

1951
06:59:54,790 --> 07:00:00,939
Image. If I take what if I take a picture of just the door? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1952
07:00:00,939 --> 07:00:04,220
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I have an idea. All right. I have an idea. I'm going to take a

1953
07:00:04,220 --> 07:00:13,750
picture of the door with this. It's empty. And then I'm going to hold on. Oh, watch this.

1954
07:00:13,750 --> 07:00:41,720
Close the door. Close the door. Now turn the light off. Come on. I thought that was going to be it.

1955
07:00:41,720 --> 07:01:12,979
And then I don't even know what this location is. Let me let me I can't move now. That's not what

1956
07:01:12,979 --> 07:01:19,060
I want to be. I want to be with water filling this place. Why is this place filling up with water?

1957
07:01:24,220 --> 07:01:43,159
Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Okay. Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Quantum tree. Watch this. Ready?

1958
07:01:43,159 --> 07:01:55,689
Okay. Quantum tree. Wait, where's the one that just back here? Where is this? Hold on. Is this

1959
07:01:55,689 --> 07:02:11,000
even? This is not even a plant. Wait a minute. This is not the this is different location.

1960
07:02:11,799 --> 07:02:32,310
This is not that planet. This is bullshit. This is we're not even on that planet.

1961
07:02:33,509 --> 07:02:47,259
All right. Hold on. Let me get out. Close this. I'm going to check out. I'm going to

1962
07:02:47,259 --> 07:03:07,450
explore the other fake planet. I think I just broke it. All right. Let's see what happens

1963
07:03:07,450 --> 07:03:22,060
when I go back over here. Let's check this out. Because these are fake planets. This is not real.

1964
07:03:22,060 --> 07:03:31,349
Look at this. It's not even real. It's probably some clue around here somewhere.

1965
07:03:32,389 --> 07:03:55,880
If this is them, this is this is the moon. But why does it look like this?

1966
07:03:56,439 --> 07:04:26,970
I'm missing something and I don't know what it is. What is it though? It's rule the sixth location.

1967
07:04:28,569 --> 07:04:59,560
That's this thing. Can I take a picture of the moon? Because I mean it's just it's just a

1968
07:04:59,560 --> 07:05:43,880
hold on. All right. Where is it? Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. Where am I? I'm out of

1969
07:05:43,959 --> 07:06:24,229
fucking fuel. Get back there very fast. But if it's if it's the rule, the sixth location is just the

1970
07:06:24,229 --> 07:06:49,159
moon and I need to keep the moon in place. The sixth location is the moon. Rule of the moon.

1971
07:06:49,159 --> 07:06:54,840
Rule of the sixth location. What is this? What is I don't even know if the sixth location is.

1972
07:06:55,560 --> 07:07:00,700
Wait, let me look. I don't have any. All right. I didn't do this shit.

1973
07:07:01,830 --> 07:07:05,990
Giants deep to the lower boat and we're in but the statue. Didn't I do this?

1974
07:07:06,790 --> 07:07:32,099
All right, we're going. No. Ocean depths.

1975
07:07:35,659 --> 07:07:41,240
It's a path beneath the surface that leads to the observatory. The trailhead starts at Brittle

1976
07:07:41,240 --> 07:08:09,240
Hollows equator. All right, let's do that. Hollows equator. Let's give it a look. Somebody said,

1977
07:08:09,319 --> 07:08:19,669
this is boring. Go back to flying into the sun. I've been to Dark Bramble. Yes, I have.

1978
07:08:20,310 --> 07:08:36,409
I did a lot of the stuff there. Brittle Hollow. The equator. It's pretty much right here. I haven't

1979
07:08:36,409 --> 07:08:40,330
really done much in this planet anyways, so I might as well just crash into it and fucking

1980
07:08:40,330 --> 07:09:07,979
everybody will laugh. Equator for this place to go in. Here's the equator. Is this thing?

1981
07:09:08,860 --> 07:09:26,139
The trees detected. All right, we have some new info. Well, shit. Okay. The trees are moving. The

1982
07:09:26,139 --> 07:09:32,459
trees in this grove wander about freely. This is not normal. Even for this alien planet. I never

1983
07:09:32,459 --> 07:09:38,680
see them move. Is this even possible? Anyone else witnesses this disturbing behavior? I implore you

1984
07:09:38,680 --> 07:09:45,400
record your observations here. These trees are aberrant. My brain must be. Flume is right. The

1985
07:09:45,400 --> 07:09:51,529
trees do move. I confess I didn't notice until I read these notes. Alarmingly, it isn't only

1986
07:09:51,529 --> 07:09:58,150
the trees. There is other matter in this area, such as that unusual shard of rock moving in the

1987
07:09:58,150 --> 07:10:06,009
same eerie way. That rock is unusual for another reason too. It possesses color and texture I've

1988
07:10:06,009 --> 07:10:11,299
never seen elsewhere on this planet. This rock shard's presence is significant. We should study

1989
07:10:11,299 --> 07:10:27,700
it. It would be what is causing other nearby objects to move. Poor shard. I already got that.

1990
07:10:27,700 --> 07:10:39,540
Wait, does it disappear? If I don't look at it. It does. Where does it go? Can I stand on it?

1991
07:10:40,580 --> 07:10:52,259
Determine this optical shard of rock as the reason objects grow and behave in a quantum manner.

1992
07:10:52,979 --> 07:10:57,779
The only other object we've observed displaying this quantum behavior is the wandering moon.

1993
07:10:57,779 --> 07:11:04,810
Yeah, imagine the moon. I think I've already read this. I know from earlier Clitz mentions this

1994
07:11:04,810 --> 07:11:08,970
strange type of rock isn't found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow. What if it isn't originally from

1995
07:11:08,970 --> 07:11:15,639
this planet? From the wandering moon. Perhaps it's even a small piece of the moon itself.

1996
07:11:15,639 --> 07:11:24,389
All right, so it's a moon. All right. All right, turn the lights off.

1997
07:11:25,349 --> 07:11:42,869
Close my eyes. I read this like four hours ago. Yeah, I did. Why is it so dark? Beneath your feet

1998
07:11:42,869 --> 07:11:49,000
lies the tower of quantum knowledge. If you're preparing to make your first pilgrimage to the

1999
07:11:49,000 --> 07:11:53,240
quantum moon, descend the steps to the entrance below. The knowledge held within will help you

2000
07:11:53,240 --> 07:12:13,979
on your journey. All right. There's the black hole. I remember falling in that earlier.

2001
07:12:14,779 --> 07:12:29,799
There. Quantum. What's this quantum? Entrance to the tower of quantum knowledge. All right,

2002
07:12:29,799 --> 07:12:35,479
I'm going in there, but what's over there? Southern Observatory. Wait, I need to do this too.

2003
07:12:36,680 --> 07:13:32,419
Arcane Sanctuary. All right, where? Turn it on. Oh, must I missed it, I think.

2004
07:13:34,900 --> 07:13:43,590
I thought it was just going to go. Wait, hold on. I might be able to get caught in it.

2005
07:13:44,229 --> 07:14:15,099
I found Rybeck. Rybeck. Oh, you launched. That's great. Great job to you. Oh, I guess that means

2006
07:14:15,099 --> 07:14:18,299
I've been out here a while, huh? Well, this is Riddle Hollow, but you probably knew that.

2007
07:14:19,259 --> 07:14:25,900
A lot of history here. It's great. What are you doing here? I'm here to see the Hanging City.

2008
07:14:28,090 --> 07:14:36,779
Um, should we be concerned about what just fell? Oh, okay. It's always been my dream to see it with

2009
07:14:36,779 --> 07:14:41,259
my own four eyes ever since I saw Hatching. Did you miss it? Because I think it was behind you.

2010
07:14:42,220 --> 07:14:47,099
The alien race lived in the solar system long before our species even existed.

2011
07:14:47,900 --> 07:14:53,659
How could I not want to see what their civilization was like? Only you've probably

2012
07:14:53,659 --> 07:14:57,099
heard the other say it, right? I'm afraid of space. Seriously, I'm more surprised than anybody that

2013
07:14:57,099 --> 07:15:03,720
I'm out here. Want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Me too, Rybeck, me too.

2014
07:15:04,599 --> 07:15:09,319
Tripped over a gravity crystal. It's dumb luck I landed somewhere my little scout says is halfway

2015
07:15:09,319 --> 07:15:15,590
stable instead of being sucked into what's below. I'm engaging the stability of the ground around

2016
07:15:15,590 --> 07:15:21,080
me using my little scout. It needs to be the place with the best surface integrity. I'm just

2017
07:15:21,080 --> 07:15:25,860
going to stay here until I'm ready to move on. That's enough about me and my problems. You didn't

2018
07:15:25,860 --> 07:15:31,060
come all this way to listen to me blather, did you? Yeah, that'd be yeah. Hey, I learned something.

2019
07:15:31,779 --> 07:15:36,630
I saw the Sunless City on the Ember Twin. You mean there's another No-My City inside the Ember

2020
07:15:36,709 --> 07:15:41,270
Twin? That's incredible. The whole city and I had no idea it existed. How'd they keep the sand out?

2021
07:15:41,830 --> 07:15:46,970
For me, I'd be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand.

2022
07:15:48,979 --> 07:15:53,380
Gosh, the No-Mys sure were ingenious, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City,

2023
07:15:53,380 --> 07:16:00,709
wow. That means there were two groups of No-My, one that lived on Ember Twin and one that lived

2024
07:16:00,709 --> 07:16:04,150
here on Brittle Hollow, but they must have traveled around the solar system since No-My

2025
07:16:04,150 --> 07:16:13,880
writing can be found on other planets too. Where should I look here? Where shouldn't you explore?

2026
07:16:14,119 --> 07:16:18,360
Not the black hole. That's very no, which is unfortunate because the most exciting

2027
07:16:18,360 --> 07:16:23,560
stuff is behind below the crust, including the Hanging City. That's just to the north.

2028
07:16:23,560 --> 07:16:28,869
You can kind of see it from here. There's also this big dome on the south pole called the

2029
07:16:28,869 --> 07:16:34,389
Southern Observatory. You can't get inside from the surface. Trust me, I tried, but it's like the

2030
07:16:34,389 --> 07:16:38,150
rest of the No-My structures here. There's probably a path to beneath the crust somewhere. I'd love

2031
07:16:38,150 --> 07:16:51,900
to be exploring. I'd love to hear it. Okay, we got some new info. I'm just going for what that is.

2032
07:17:09,849 --> 07:17:55,000
Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Let me back in. Can I reach that

2033
07:17:55,000 --> 07:18:21,580
from here? I'm just gonna go to the interloper. I'm actually going pretty fast. Okay, all right,

2034
07:18:21,580 --> 07:18:46,330
all right, all right. I'm in perfect trajectory. Load up. 27, 28, 26, 2000, 17. All right, keep

2035
07:18:46,330 --> 07:19:18,310
going. 15, 13, 12, 11, 10. Okay, slow, slow, slow. 29. All right, where am I, sir? The interloper.

2036
07:19:18,310 --> 07:19:41,900
Is this an asteroid? Land. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. All right, let me.

2037
07:19:42,700 --> 07:20:16,099
We're not going into the sun, are we? No. Are we? No. Distress beacon? There's a distress beacon

2038
07:20:16,099 --> 07:20:25,430
up there. All right. What's going on? Hide and seek. No, there's no frequency over here. All

2039
07:20:25,430 --> 07:20:35,139
right. What am I looking for? Something up here? Something to look at? Is there anything up here?

2040
07:20:35,779 --> 07:21:08,419
What about on the top? No. Up here. The giant ice. Wait a minute. What's that? Something. Something.

2041
07:21:09,139 --> 07:21:31,290
It's me. Something right here. Something. Come on. I just need to see before I die. Before I die.

2042
07:21:31,290 --> 07:21:42,979
Before I die. Come on. I need to see before I die. I need to see before I die. Please. I need to

2043
07:21:42,979 --> 07:21:59,720
see before I die. There's nothing to see. Turn around. I mean, I'm dead. What did I miss? I was

2044
07:21:59,720 --> 07:22:12,740
too focused on my breath meter going to zero. I went too fast. Golden retriever brain? Golden

2045
07:22:12,740 --> 07:22:16,419
retrievers are like the smartest animal though. Dude, what the fuck? Do you think I care about

2046
07:22:16,419 --> 07:22:30,180
you saying that? That's one of the smartest animals on earth. I think I'm gonna call it here.

2047
07:22:33,500 --> 07:22:37,180
I'm gonna call it here. I'm gonna call it here. I want and because I'm getting addicted to the game

2048
07:22:37,180 --> 07:22:49,720
and I want enough for tomorrow as well. Power of quantum knowledge. Pipex camp. Hanging city.

2049
07:22:50,360 --> 07:22:59,990
Go back to the comet first. All right. I'll go back. I'm gonna just fly the ship to the comet

2050
07:23:00,869 --> 07:23:15,880
and see if I can find what you're talking about. Interloper. There it is. Far away.

2051
07:23:16,439 --> 07:23:30,970
So I'm gonna assume there's probably at least another good six to eight hours left of the game.

2052
07:23:32,090 --> 07:23:41,400
Have I peed one time? No. I have not gotten up for a single break. No, you're right. Maybe a

2053
07:23:41,400 --> 07:23:48,360
little bit more than that. That's all right. I plan on trying to finish this game tomorrow.

2054
07:23:49,159 --> 07:24:07,479
That's the plan. You could beat it tonight. Well, we'll see. We'll see where it takes us.

2055
07:24:08,200 --> 07:24:10,919
There's more than enough game for another day, I can tell you that. All right. Well, that's

2056
07:24:11,880 --> 07:24:18,900
gonna finish tomorrow. And then after that, should be able to play Tony Hawk.

2057
07:24:19,700 --> 07:24:27,540
For some reason, the Xbox 360 hard drive is not in. I'm going way too fast, boys and girls. And

2058
07:24:27,540 --> 07:24:33,220
this is what happens when I'm not paying attention. I'm just talking. I am okay. I think

2059
07:24:36,580 --> 07:24:54,220
this damaged the headlights a little. Who cares? Let's see if I can find this. What

2060
07:24:54,220 --> 07:25:09,240
you guys are talking about? Okay. So there's a there was apparently a ship that you said

2061
07:25:09,240 --> 07:25:20,520
there was a there was a missed a ship. This is just a suicide mission. Yes.

2062
07:25:20,520 --> 07:25:58,099
You're here somewhere? Because I remember this is this part. What's that light? We're here?

2063
07:25:58,819 --> 07:26:25,400
Uh, I don't see anything. Like that way. Oh, we're going towards the sun. My hey,

2064
07:26:25,400 --> 07:27:03,180
have to be careful. Now I can reach this. Where the hell is that ship? I don't think I think I'm

2065
07:27:03,180 --> 07:27:26,119
better reach. I literally can't feel anywhere. I just got at the sub that I was trying to find

2066
07:27:26,119 --> 07:27:31,000
this thing. And now the sun was coming up and I thought I was going to fucking fall into the sun.

2067
07:27:31,799 --> 07:27:43,240
I don't I don't know if this is I don't have to do this on the side with the spikes.

2068
07:27:43,240 --> 07:27:50,069
Like I was on that side. Let me try this one more time. One more time.

2069
07:27:50,869 --> 07:28:06,340
It's done. Wasn't I in the spikes when I fell off?

2070
07:28:07,220 --> 07:28:22,569
Didn't look. Yeah. But I mean, the things made it to ice and you just skim. I can't like walk on

2071
07:28:22,569 --> 07:28:28,659
the surface and just skimming across the surface. I can't walk on it. There's no gravity on this

2072
07:28:28,659 --> 07:29:00,180
thing. All right. Last try. And then that's the end of the stream. It's a million years away.

2073
07:29:00,900 --> 07:29:24,439
He's addicted. I think a little I think I'm more addicted to one. Just want to know what the hell

2074
07:29:24,439 --> 07:29:35,020
happens. The story has me intrigued. I want to know what's going on. Why am I teleporting back

2075
07:29:35,020 --> 07:29:45,319
through time? What do these people do? What did this other civilization do? And why are we here

2076
07:29:45,319 --> 07:30:02,540
doing this? See you later. I'm going to bed. I'm sitting there talking to you guys. I'm sitting

2077
07:30:02,540 --> 07:30:06,860
here looking at chat with holding the button. And I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm addicted. And

2078
07:30:06,860 --> 07:30:19,479
I like to talk about the story and seeing what you guys have to say. I'm still going negative

2079
07:30:19,479 --> 07:30:30,099
miles per hour. I'm like 10. I'm much further. Let's try this again. This thing's so tiny. It's

2080
07:30:30,099 --> 07:30:39,400
so hard to find just such a small little fucking asteroid. Like this is why space games are hard

2081
07:30:39,400 --> 07:30:47,080
for my brain. I feel like I'm not even moving right now. In my fucking cube brain. I'm standing

2082
07:30:47,080 --> 07:31:34,409
still. Here comes the trash planet. Try to get on the spikes. What am I looking for here?

2083
07:31:35,610 --> 07:31:41,750
I see something underneath. No, it's not. That's not anything. That's nothing.

2084
07:31:43,639 --> 07:32:01,860
Right in the middle. Right there. Right there. Right there. All right. What's that? Found it.

2085
07:32:02,419 --> 07:32:24,330
It's a suicide mission. I don't care. This is troublesome. It seems the comet wishes to

2086
07:32:24,330 --> 07:32:29,610
submerge our shuttle in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the shuttle may freeze entirely.

2087
07:32:30,650 --> 07:32:37,110
Even if it did, wouldn't someone call it back home to the gravity cannon on Ember Twin? Yes,

2088
07:32:37,110 --> 07:32:40,869
but the exploration of the comet would be more difficult if we were without the shuttle.

2089
07:32:40,869 --> 07:32:45,500
Until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn't have landed on the dark side of the comet.

2090
07:32:45,500 --> 07:32:51,259
I suppose one of us remained on the shuttle. In the shuttle to keep it warm and continue monitoring

2091
07:32:51,259 --> 07:32:56,299
the surface. Could it be wise, I think? Larry, if you don't mind waiting here with it, Oak and I

2092
07:32:57,259 --> 07:33:21,400
can continue to investigate the surface. I didn't jump. I didn't jump. I did not jump.

2093
07:33:21,400 --> 07:33:28,459
I didn't press any buttons. I didn't do anything. It sucked us out. Did you not see

2094
07:33:29,020 --> 07:33:54,520
my friend the ship getting sucked out? I didn't do anything. Get in. Hey, we did it. Let's download

2095
07:33:54,520 --> 07:34:14,500
that data. All right. That's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow for more Out of Wild. We'll try

2096
07:34:14,500 --> 07:34:37,290
to finish the game. Final Sun joke? No, no, no, no, no. Something here. I want to see.

2097
07:34:38,169 --> 07:34:50,150
Hey, Jerma, that was a good try. Hey, thanks. All right. What else is on here?

2098
07:34:51,349 --> 07:35:23,209
Okay. What else is on here? Something else? Wait, the ice can melt? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

2099
07:35:23,209 --> 07:35:42,840
wait. Holy shit. The ice is... Okay. Hold on. Where's the tail? All right. Where was that?

2100
07:35:42,840 --> 07:35:56,919
There it is. All right. This is gonna melt. All right. This is gonna melt. Quantum melt?

2101
07:35:57,560 --> 07:36:22,220
That sounds like a Subway sandwich. The quantum melt at Subway.

2102
07:36:23,900 --> 07:36:29,319
All right. I'm so far away from the sun. Am I even gonna do it? Am I even gonna come back there?

2103
07:36:30,119 --> 07:36:39,099
Holy shit. I want one of those. A quantum melt? Seriously? That would be turkey, ham,

2104
07:36:39,900 --> 07:36:46,459
like six different kinds of cheeses. It'd be like Swiss, cheddar, provolone, gruyere, brie.

2105
07:36:47,099 --> 07:37:30,330
It'd be every cheese. I'm gonna sit here. I'm not gonna move, right? Secret menu. Check the orbit?

2106
07:37:30,330 --> 07:37:42,979
Yeah. Wait, is this gonna take too long? Is this song gonna explode? Just read bits? Yeah,

2107
07:37:42,979 --> 07:38:01,029
that's not a bad idea. I'll just read bits. That sounds good. Still going? Still moving, right?

2108
07:38:01,990 --> 07:38:12,090
Or is it paused? Is it paused when it's all tabbed? I think it's paused when it's all tabbed.

2109
07:38:13,049 --> 07:38:20,299
Well, I can do it because I can just load up the screen over here. All right.

2110
07:38:21,020 --> 07:38:24,409
Let's go back. Thanks. That's the end of the stream. See you guys tomorrow.

2111
07:38:25,049 --> 07:38:34,580
Let's go back a little bit and read some bits. Super Bruce gave five community subs. Thank you,

2112
07:38:34,580 --> 07:38:41,830
Super Bruce. Appreciate it. That was earlier, about six or seven hours ago here. Seven or eight

2113
07:38:41,830 --> 07:38:51,110
hours, actually, almost. Sweet Croc, thanks for the 1500 bits. $15. Say, hey, Jeremy, I've been

2114
07:38:51,110 --> 07:38:55,849
watching for a while. Finally getting to donate. Out of Wilds was my game of the year last year

2115
07:38:55,849 --> 07:38:59,369
and maybe my favorite game of the last five years. Hope you enjoy it. Can't wait to watch.

2116
07:39:00,090 --> 07:39:06,860
It is very enjoyable. I especially like the story. I want to know why this is happening.

2117
07:39:07,580 --> 07:39:13,189
Somebody's just breathing in your room. Yes. Did nobody say that? I did.

2118
07:39:13,189 --> 07:39:21,020
But thank you. Appreciate the 1500 bits and it's pretty good so far. We'll see how I feel about it

2119
07:39:21,020 --> 07:39:26,500
after another day. I feel like I'm probably going to like it though. It seems really good,

2120
07:39:26,500 --> 07:39:34,580
is what I've played so far. Hey, more jelly. Thanks for the 500 bits. Oh, you say it's declined,

2121
07:39:34,580 --> 07:39:39,590
huh? You said it was declined. All right, shit. Well, try my MasterCard, bro. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2122
07:39:39,590 --> 07:39:54,439
I got money on my MasterCard. Sure. Thank you more jelly with the $5. Do not fuck with your card.

2123
07:39:58,580 --> 07:40:07,619
Thank you, Hikiko Morris Sunday. What just happened? We coming on? That's the wrong controller.

2124
07:40:07,619 --> 07:40:18,900
This Xbox fucking 360 controller. Hold on. No, we're good. We're actually getting close.

2125
07:40:20,619 --> 07:40:28,419
Thank you to Hikiko Morris Sunday for the 300 bits. They say, Hi, Jim. A couple weeks ago,

2126
07:40:28,419 --> 07:40:31,619
I had a dream that I sent a message in chat saying that I was having a birthday party,

2127
07:40:31,619 --> 07:40:35,700
but no one showed up. So you doxed me to encourage people to come over, but no one showed up.

2128
07:40:36,659 --> 07:40:49,959
Anyway, what's your favorite Destiny's Child song? Mine is Say My Name. That one too. I like that

2129
07:40:49,959 --> 07:40:58,970
one. That's good. Digitron Surfers, thanks for the 500 bits. In the upcoming YouTuber movie series,

2130
07:40:58,970 --> 07:41:02,569
are you going to be playing penis Jerma or are you going to just to play yourself? I love your

2131
07:41:02,569 --> 07:41:17,259
channel. I don't even know what that means. Bryant Ziggs, thanks for the, hold on. We're almost there.

2132
07:41:17,259 --> 07:41:24,150
All right, let's see what happens. Bryant Ziggs, thanks for 1500 bits. Jerma, I had a dream the

2133
07:41:24,150 --> 07:42:01,380
other night that you were doing a live show in my, another dream. Melt? That didn't do anything.

2134
07:42:01,380 --> 07:42:25,060
All right, goodbye. 20 jump jump. I didn't twice jump. I didn't. The sun comes up and fucking

2135
07:42:25,939 --> 07:42:32,180
pulls you up and I was holding left trigger. Run it back. I was holding left trigger and like

2136
07:42:32,180 --> 07:42:40,299
forward facing down. No, no, I got baited and that's fine. I can just quit, right?

2137
07:42:40,860 --> 07:42:59,799
Reset, loop and quit. Yeah, right? This is okay. We'll see what happens at the end of the game

2138
07:42:59,799 --> 07:43:12,250
tomorrow. Very cool. I will see you guys tomorrow for more Outer Wilds. Let's get the actual intro

2139
07:43:12,250 --> 07:43:21,939
or intro outro up. See what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be starting. Oh, what time am I going to

2140
07:43:21,939 --> 07:43:40,409
start tomorrow? Two again. And we're on like 145, 132. Something like that. But we had the 15 dollars

2141
07:43:40,409 --> 07:43:44,169
from Brian Ziggs. Thank you, Brian. Jerma, I had a dream the other night that you're doing a live

2142
07:43:44,169 --> 07:43:48,250
show in my city. I was so excited. I got all my friends and my girlfriend to go to it with me.

2143
07:43:48,889 --> 07:43:53,450
We managed to get front row seats and I prepared for what would be the greatest experience of my

2144
07:43:53,450 --> 07:43:59,450
whole life. What I got instead was you roasting the shit out of me for an hour. You absolutely

2145
07:43:59,450 --> 07:44:02,729
went in on me and all I could do was sit there and wonder what I did to deserve it.

2146
07:44:03,689 --> 07:44:08,310
I would never do that to somebody.

2147
07:44:09,029 --> 07:44:17,419
Oh, I'm sorry that I'm sorry the dream, Jerma, is a nuisance and a menace to society.

2148
07:44:20,099 --> 07:44:28,279
I don't know why. Evil, evil Jerma apparently sneaks into your dreams.

2149
07:44:29,080 --> 07:44:35,939
Hey, Drumager, thanks for the 500 bits. Since you don't seem to have a clue of your speed,

2150
07:44:36,979 --> 07:44:43,220
one mile equals roughly 1600 meters. Your speed is shown in meters per second. If you multiply it

2151
07:44:43,380 --> 07:44:49,459
by 3.6, it transfers to kilometers per hour. For reference, sound of speed in the air is around

2152
07:44:49,459 --> 07:44:53,299
343 meters per second. You're basically slamming into a planet twice that speed.

2153
07:45:00,020 --> 07:45:04,500
Well, it only took me eight hours straight of playing Astaroth's Wrath to find out that I

2154
07:45:04,500 --> 07:45:09,939
could regain health by hitting A. I didn't even need it. Beat the fucking game on hard.

2155
07:45:10,659 --> 07:45:20,409
It's all good. But thank you, though. And then we had PlankCat gave 1500 bits. Thank you for

2156
07:45:20,409 --> 07:45:26,680
the $15 PlankCat. I love your unbridled curiosity. It's perfect for this game.

2157
07:45:26,680 --> 07:45:31,830
This game is really cool for the one reason because you don't really have anything to do.

2158
07:45:33,080 --> 07:45:40,889
You do, but you don't. I like that aspect of just kind of doing anything you want without a real

2159
07:45:40,889 --> 07:45:45,849
goal. You just have this overarching thing that you're trying to figure out, but you don't have

2160
07:45:45,849 --> 07:45:55,880
like an A to B. You just go anywhere. I don't like the forced reset, but I understand it.

2161
07:45:57,110 --> 07:46:02,790
I think the forced reset, at least for me, is sort of tells you, all right, hey, you had some fun,

2162
07:46:02,790 --> 07:46:09,750
now do something else. It's almost like you have a time limit. It's good for me because I get so

2163
07:46:09,750 --> 07:46:15,939
fucked up and I'll get stuck on a planet for like three hours. So it helps me just be like, all

2164
07:46:15,939 --> 07:46:28,090
right, here comes the supernova. What are you doing tomorrow? It's good for ADHD. Yeah, because it

2165
07:46:28,090 --> 07:46:36,099
makes me have to do something else. I think it would be better if you had a kill me button.

2166
07:46:39,139 --> 07:46:46,180
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of dark and morbid, I guess, but there really probably should be like

2167
07:46:46,180 --> 07:46:50,580
I just rip the mask off the button if you like hold left trigger and right trigger for like five

2168
07:46:50,580 --> 07:46:57,939
seconds. So you can just like, instead of having to quit main menu restart, I feel like that's

2169
07:46:58,740 --> 07:47:08,470
takes you out of the experience. I'd rather be able just to rip the mask off and just delete it

2170
07:47:08,470 --> 07:47:21,349
and just go to the next day. It is, it is a lot of fun so far. I'm going to be sad when it's over.

2171
07:47:21,909 --> 07:47:26,310
Ocean dweller, thanks for 250. Dermagreatstream, as always, just wanted to say that the elevator

2172
07:47:26,310 --> 07:47:29,750
crush death summed up everything so perfectly about this playthrough. It was wonderful.

2173
07:47:37,220 --> 07:47:41,779
SoupGG, thanks for five dollars. Hey buddy, I guarantee it will take you at least four attempts

2174
07:47:41,779 --> 07:47:47,139
to beat the mission Big Apple Spot Challenge near the end of Tony Hawk's Underground this Friday.

2175
07:47:47,860 --> 07:47:52,180
If you can beat it in less than four, I will vomit up a Philly cheesesteak on my keyboard.

2176
07:47:52,819 --> 07:48:03,110
Aren't my words pal? I'll try. I'll try. Also keep in mind the Tony Hawk Underground stream

2177
07:48:03,110 --> 07:48:11,130
might happen on Saturday. Or sorry, yes Friday, right? Friday or Saturday because I have to wait

2178
07:48:11,130 --> 07:48:16,729
for that 360 hard drive to get in and it's in the mail so it might take another day. I don't know.

2179
07:48:18,009 --> 07:48:29,029
It will happen this week though before I leave. Hopefully it comes in for the next day or so.

2180
07:48:31,380 --> 07:48:35,939
But let's get the community subs and the regular subs and the credit subs,

2181
07:48:38,979 --> 07:48:52,090
all of them, going at the same time. Here come the credits. Here comes the janitor.

2182
07:48:52,090 --> 07:48:57,540
I'm gonna bump you. What is the German's favorite Beyonce song? Single Ladies.

2183
07:48:58,180 --> 07:49:03,340
Easy. It's the easiest question I've had all night. Thanks everybody for subbing.

2184
07:49:08,569 --> 07:49:16,409
Outer Wilds is a lot of fun. I look forward to completing it and seeing what happens.

2185
07:49:18,200 --> 07:49:29,909
Let's run the credits. I can't believe I, you know the thing I'm most annoyed about tonight?

2186
07:49:31,380 --> 07:49:34,500
The fact that I was like almost, I was more than a half a second

2187
07:49:35,459 --> 07:49:38,740
behind every event that happened on screen for like the first three and a half hours.

2188
07:49:39,860 --> 07:49:52,569
I'm so annoyed by that. It's all good though. Won't happen tomorrow. All right we do have a

2189
07:49:52,569 --> 07:49:57,450
little bit more to do. We have now similar bits to do. All of one zombie thanks to the 250. Hey

2190
07:49:57,450 --> 07:50:02,090
you think you'll ever play Prey? I mentioned it in the stalker stream. It's got a great art style

2191
07:50:02,090 --> 07:50:09,750
and soundtrack. I like space games though nothing will compare to Space Master. It's not really.

2192
07:50:09,750 --> 07:50:17,139
That is the best space game ever made. Oh Prey and Thief are the same game in my brain

2193
07:50:18,599 --> 07:50:30,419
and I don't know why. Is there a reason why that is? I don't, I'm just being honest. I don't know

2194
07:50:30,419 --> 07:50:36,340
why that is. They're not even the same at all. Yeah I don't, I don't know why that's happening.

2195
07:50:37,299 --> 07:50:51,750
Yeah put it on the list. The OG Thief games are good. Fuck the new one. Really okay.

2196
07:50:52,869 --> 07:51:01,459
I'll play Prey. Yeah let's go. Prey is basically a current gen remake of System Shock 2 which is

2197
07:51:01,459 --> 07:51:13,240
made by the same studio as Thief. Oh that's why I'm doing that. Put it on the list. Dark soul thanks

2198
07:51:13,240 --> 07:51:18,279
to the 250. Do you have any good awful local commercials to share? Here's one of my favorites.

2199
07:51:19,159 --> 07:51:24,250
Local commercials. Brothers Scrap Metal commercial.

2200
07:51:46,970 --> 07:51:48,330
Why would you have this much scrap metal?

2201
07:51:55,990 --> 07:51:59,270
Just because? Why would you have a ton of scrap metal in your house?

2202
07:52:02,259 --> 07:52:07,159
Uh I mean not really local commercials but anything with Kathy Mitchell is like

2203
07:52:07,159 --> 07:52:11,799
an automatic A plus commercial for me or infomercial. Hi Kathy Mitchell here with

2204
07:52:11,799 --> 07:52:20,840
the Super Cooker. She's, I love her so much. You guys like seriously don't know. I am a huge fan

2205
07:52:20,840 --> 07:52:27,669
of Kathy Mitchell. I'm a huge fan. If me and Kathy Mitchell were in the same room at a convention,

2206
07:52:28,389 --> 07:52:33,799
I would get nervous and I'd be taken aback. Oh it's Kathy Mitchell. She's not, she wouldn't,

2207
07:52:33,799 --> 07:52:43,209
she's not talking to me. I would want Kathy Mitchell's autograph and a photo and it would

2208
07:52:43,209 --> 07:52:48,889
be a great, it would be a great day. I'd feel so happy. Be like I got to meet Kathy Mitchell today.

2209
07:52:48,889 --> 07:52:58,180
No way. She's the dump cakes lady. Yeah she's been around for a long time. The new wave oven,

2210
07:52:59,139 --> 07:53:10,520
the pasta pro, dump cakes, dump meals. She does it all. I'm gonna do you all a favor.

2211
07:53:12,759 --> 07:53:18,979
Go to YouTube and just watch the new wave oven infomercial with Kathy Mitchell

2212
07:53:20,090 --> 07:53:31,220
and you will just absolutely adore everything that she does. She's just wonderful. Watch it now.

2213
07:53:31,220 --> 07:53:34,580
That's like a 30 minute infomercial. I'm not watching it right now. I'm getting out of here.

2214
07:53:34,580 --> 07:53:41,590
I'm going to get food and pee for the first time in eight hours. But we have one more bit donation

2215
07:53:41,590 --> 07:53:53,959
to do in this big one. $25.25. 100 bits from Lizard Amiibo. Thanks for the 25 bucks. I was

2216
07:53:53,959 --> 07:53:57,560
going to use this money to feed my 10 starving children but decided you could probably use it

2217
07:53:57,560 --> 07:54:12,810
more. Don't read this part out loud. Okay. Oh no. Okay. So uh no it's all good. Talking about the

2218
07:54:12,810 --> 07:54:26,490
doctor appointment I had. So basically how it goes is I probably just have a costochondritis.

2219
07:54:26,490 --> 07:54:31,610
It is just an inflammation in my rib cage the way they connect in the front of the sternum and in

2220
07:54:31,610 --> 07:54:38,889
the back of the spine. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it. There's only one

2221
07:54:38,889 --> 07:54:43,689
thing you can really do about costochondritis. Hope it goes away on its own. Which it does for

2222
07:54:43,689 --> 07:54:48,970
a lot of people. Sometimes it takes six months. Sometimes it takes 10 years. But it can go away.

2223
07:54:49,770 --> 07:54:55,779
Or you do physical therapy to try to correct it. To try to alleviate some of the pain and the

2224
07:54:55,779 --> 07:55:04,259
symptoms. That's another route. The other route is to get a nerve blocking injection into my ribs

2225
07:55:04,259 --> 07:55:11,560
in like six or five or six places around the spots where it hurts. And then it's gone. But you may

2226
07:55:11,560 --> 07:55:18,180
have to do that injection more than once. You may have to do those injections every three or four

2227
07:55:18,180 --> 07:55:24,419
months. I was told some people get an injection for two or three or four and it goes away forever

2228
07:55:24,419 --> 07:55:30,650
and it never comes back. I've also been told by the same doctor that for some people the pain

2229
07:55:30,650 --> 07:55:42,169
comes back in like a month and you have to do it again. So I am going to be doing physical therapy.

2230
07:55:43,130 --> 07:55:50,330
I don't like the idea of going right and jumping the gun and blocking nerves with injections. I don't

2231
07:55:50,330 --> 07:55:57,819
want to do that yet. If I have to I will. But I want to do physical therapy first. That's the plan.

2232
07:55:57,819 --> 07:56:05,430
And that's sort of what this whole thing has turned out to be. Like it makes a lot of sense

2233
07:56:05,430 --> 07:56:11,349
because I can lean back and I can put a little pressure on my chest. And if I lean back the

2234
07:56:11,349 --> 07:56:17,720
middle of my chest and sternum just pop pop pop hurt hurt hurt. Same thing if I lean to the left

2235
07:56:17,720 --> 07:56:21,799
or right I can feel it in the back of my ribs the way my ribs connect to my spine. It's like

2236
07:56:22,840 --> 07:56:33,529
and that's also another reason why I haven't done green screen stuff yet. I just need to get the okay

2237
07:56:33,529 --> 07:56:40,380
and it's like okay now turning doesn't hurt and leaning back and forward doesn't hurt you know

2238
07:56:40,380 --> 07:56:51,020
I'm saying. Just trying to get to that point. Costochondritis inflammation in my rib cage where

2239
07:56:51,020 --> 07:56:59,380
they connect. Don't know why I have it. It just do. But that's pretty much how that story goes.

2240
07:57:02,389 --> 07:57:09,270
The good thing is I've had a lot of tests. I've had spinal MRIs. I've had abdominal MRIs. They've

2241
07:57:09,270 --> 07:57:14,790
looked at all my organs. I've had tons of tests. They checked all my fucking my kidneys and my

2242
07:57:14,790 --> 07:57:23,049
liver and everything seems to be in working order. So I've been told that this is not a serious

2243
07:57:23,049 --> 07:57:37,540
condition. It's just one that you have you have now. So and with that that's where we're going to

2244
07:57:37,540 --> 07:57:44,360
end the stream tonight. Thanks everybody for watching. See you tomorrow around two-ish one

2245
07:57:44,360 --> 07:57:50,169
to two-ish probably 2 p.m pacific for more Outer Smiles.
