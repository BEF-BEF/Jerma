1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:42,859
What's up? Good afternoon. Yeah, it's a surprise. Surprise, I'm live today. I know I originally, you know what, if you're a watcher of this stream, what you should do is you should check the sus, right? And then what you should do is come back, come back the next day and check it again. I feel like I've reversed the stream schedule the last three weeks every single week. This is this is like the third or fourth reverse delay.

2
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:43,700
Uh, in a row, check it once an hour more like and the next day and the next day and the next day. All right. Yeah, originally I was going to stream today. A couple days ago we talked. Oh, yeah, I'll be live on Wednesday with more Breath of the Wild. But it's my birthday. Not today. And there may have been some birthday plans. I was like, you know what, maybe I'll just come back on Friday. But birthday plans have shifted. So I'm available.

3
00:01:19,500 --> 00:02:14,020
Available today. Not going to be available tomorrow. Tomorrow, the next day. We'll go today. I'm here. I'm ready. Hey, he's available. But yeah, let's play some more Breath of the Wild. Happy birthday. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Thirty seven. Thirty seven. And I can still do this. I can still do this. You didn't see what I did, but it was cool. My hands moved so fast. It's his bones cracking. I also wanted to play Breath of the Wild.

4
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:41,569
For my birthday. So that's where we are. He's still got it. Yeah, still to this day. Yeah, early, early start today. In mod chat, we have a gameplay thing chat wanted to tell you about.

5
00:02:42,860 --> 00:03:01,900
Oh, OK. Yep. Uh huh. The shield surfing. Jump and tap the parry button and you can slide around. OK. I'm all right with backseat tips. I'm not OK with you telling me.

6
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:22,900
Uh, who Ganon is, right? I don't want to know who Ganon is to the last cut scene. You're thirty seven. What the fuck? Dude, I know. I'm sorry that you're big. I'm sorry you're figuring this out now. No, I'm not. I'm not like twenty six. No, I'm thirty seven.

7
00:03:22,900 --> 00:04:16,589
Ganon is Ganondorf. You're almost forty. Yeah, whatever. Whatever. I'm closer to fifty. Yeah. Dude, can you please be younger? That's I don't think that that's not how it works. Do you think twenty six is young? No. What do you mean? What? I'm that old now. All I said was I see I started YouTube when I was twenty six. That's what I'm saying. I started YouTube when I was twenty six.

8
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,310
Twenty five. Whatever it was. I've never really been doing this for twelve years. Almost. Wow. Twenty six is young. Yeah, it is. Thirty seven is young, too. I'm still a young man. I'm still a young man. I'm not forty yet. You know, I am. I'm fighting until that four zero shows up. You know what I mean? On my thirty ninth birthday. No, the night before my fortieth birthday, I am going to be

9
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:40,529
in a full Super Mario pajama onesie, and I'm going to eat popsicles and like and popcorn and watch fucking TV shows all day. I'm literally going to. And then I'm throwing all those pajamas away when I turn forty. I'm going to have an absolute pajama blowout on the night of my fortieth birthday, and I'm just going to burn them all. And it's going to replace my whole closet, going to replace with suits in life crisis. Thirty nine year old behavior.

10
00:05:40,769 --> 00:07:02,259
Yeah, what am I going to do with all of my Super Mario pajamas? Fucking finally a good title. What would be finally a good title? I guess I forgot I played the game, by the way. It's going to take me a few minutes. There it is. Breath of the wild. OK, so the jump is that this is attack. It's you hold buttons. All right, fine. Yeah, I'm still a young man. Yeah, not until forty. People are living longer anyways. You're using you. Why do you still have a mop? Thanks for reminding me.

11
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:22,560
All right. So what was the last thing we did? Check the map. Oh, that's a good idea. All right. So we're going here. This is locked memories. We have to go do.

12
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Impa told us that there was some crazy shit going on down here. I can have a birthday hat on because it's not my birthday. You can't read. I can read. Can we see more of your beautiful face?

13
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:54,009
It's here. What do you want me to like pull my skin back? What do you mean? Let's see more. This is I'm in front of you right now.

14
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:20,209
Your head is cropped. It's yeah, but that's what do you mean? Yeah, my head is cropped because that's how it works. That's what a face cam is, guys. You understand the word face cam.

15
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:37,639
It's not body full body cam. It's not all of my upper body and like my face cam. It's a camera for your face to be in the corner. And that's precisely what I'm doing. That's how it's going to stay. Let's go.

16
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:49,799
All right. So I need to go from here to here. I'm excited to play this game. I'm telling you, I'm actually excited about it. Is it fall damage? I would have died. Of course there is. All right. Let's glide.

17
00:08:51,779 --> 00:09:30,990
Two headphones in for this. Welcome back to Breath of the Wild. We're going to explore this part of the map. We see your neck. That's an easy way to go across the whole game. This game is potentially hundreds of hours. I'm so excited. Made it with time to spare. Come on.

18
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:58,500
The person is saying help? I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I want a reward. I'm coming. I can't say it. You know what I mean? I'm coming. I want a reward. I know that's kind of fucked up to say. This person dead? No, you're all right. I saved you.

19
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:23,070
Wait, stop. They never fight fair. They always lurk and wait to ambush us. What a bunch of cowards. Seems like every time I go out hunting for arty truffles, I'm taking my life in my hands. Time to stop floofing around here.

20
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:58,379
Let's get back to the hunt for the hardy truffles. I mean, I don't have a weapon. I'm right behind me. What is she scared? You scared of this? Oh, shit. He's attacking another another citizen. You all right. All right. Let's keep going.

21
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:35,450
Somewhere this way. Yeah. Yeah. What's this town? It's very bright. This is a bright town. Can I go in? Can I just go in? Can I just go in? You can. You can go in buildings in this game.

22
00:11:42,710 --> 00:12:13,610
I got to get it out of my system. OK. Make their beds. Dude, you need to keep that shit in. Keep it in. No. Do you want to know what keeping it in means for me? If I had to keep it all in after like an hour, I'd be like this.

23
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:30,370
It would be insane. I would explode. Oh, I can dye my clothing.

24
00:12:31,370 --> 00:13:13,740
Now, should I change that? Wait, can I change the Nintendo Switch colors like Xbox? This is worth 20 bucks for me. OK, chain. Choose a color. What? You're wearing clothes that you can't dye. That's unfair. I want to make the shirt green.

25
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:40,870
No, I need different clothes. I'm getting one hit by random enemies. I need armor and shit, right? I'm getting one hit killed by the random goofballs outside. Please be all red. No, it's not worth 20 bucks.

26
00:13:42,980 --> 00:14:04,100
Buy armor in this village. How much money do I even have? I only have $37. Why would I have no money? Checking everyone out today, too. The check-in just never stops. Never stay to the Tanpu Inn. No, you're not staying there then. I'm supposed to check out everyone who comes into town.

27
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:46,289
That's weird. Dollars? Sorry. Rupees. My 37 rupees. Sorry, I didn't say what it is. It's whatever bucks. Dollars. Money. How much money do I have? Do I have to say how many rupees do I have? You know what it is. You know what it is. That's like calling everything gold. That's fine. How many gold coins do I have?

28
00:14:46,809 --> 00:15:22,460
Grandpa, it's rupees, but you don't turn the game off. Any beauties or suspicious folks? What are you talking about? Go stay at the inn. You're not immersed? Yes, I am. I have so many side quests. I have to get overwhelmed with how many things there are to do.

29
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:49,629
First things first. The most important thing that I want to do right now is go to the shrine because that's what I like. My favorite part. Where is it? This way. It might be underwater. There it is. Out of my fucking way. There it is.

30
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:25,389
Oh, man. Oh, come on, dude. I was about to say something funny. I was going to say something funny. Yeah, it was going to be wicked funny. Oh, it's because I forgot. All right. If I fall off this and drown, I'm going to be very upset. No, I'm good. I glitched it out.

31
00:16:25,389 --> 00:17:26,450
Would I have a breakfast? Yogurt. I had a yogurt. It was good. Was it Greek yogurt? Yes. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, it was. What's wrong? Wait. Oh, I thought I was going to just walk in. It's not goat milk. Greek yogurt is not goat milk. Shut the fuck up. It can be. No, it's not. Greek yogurt is not made from goat cheese. Shut the fuck up.

32
00:17:46,299 --> 00:18:43,769
I'm not. I'm just kidding. God. God. All right. Where's ball? Greek yogurt is not goat milk. Why did I think I could reach that? It's your fault for distracting me with your goat cheese. OK, I need to eat something before I die in here. Oh, emote only is on. Right. So I don't get spoiled. OK, I've got. What about magnet? I do anything, move anything, throw anything, twist anything. Doesn't look like it. So what about stasis?

33
00:18:44,769 --> 00:19:52,140
Hey, where's the ball? I think it's over here. Oh, OK. Well, move. Oh, you're not going to gyroscope me right now, right? Will he beat the dungeon before 1 p.m.? Yeah, I of course I will get it. Get it right. Check it out. I'm telling you right now. You should be voting for me to win. Yeah, almost.

34
00:19:52,140 --> 00:21:48,779
Oh, shit. Wait a minute, can I? I can probably just launch it over there. What time is it? All right. No, I'm going to do it the right way. Oh, you piece of shit. Yeah, there you go. Before 1 p.m. done. What's going on? Oh, wait. I can make this jump now if I tilt it down. Oh, that's just a chest. That's just a treasure chest. I thought that was a button that I thought that was the end of the maze. Oh, my goodness. Right. I have to get it down here. OK, I thought that was a button. I thought I was going to drop a separate ball. I don't know. What time is it?

35
00:21:48,940 --> 00:22:45,549
I still don't think you should vote against me. I still don't think you should have voted against me because I figured that part out. That's the most important thing to figure out. So watch this. Yeah, I saw. I saw the person. Yeah, I saw it.

36
00:22:45,549 --> 00:23:06,390
Yeah. You don't think I've read what people say sometimes about me? Somebody told me, well, maybe indirectly. I don't know. I heard that watching me play this was like watching an early human learn how to use tools for the first time. It's kind of rude, I think. Fuck.

37
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:42,299
All right. All right. Oh, yeah. How's it for a fucking tool? Huh? Take that early human. Fuck you. God damn it. All right. I got seven minutes. I'm fine. Yeah. What the fuck?

38
00:23:42,299 --> 00:25:00,019
Oh, my goodness. All right. I got to get it. Let's do it right. What time is it? I got plenty of time. Believers, you win. This doesn't count as you know what I mean? This doesn't count. I already beat it.

39
00:25:00,019 --> 00:26:57,210
I actually I thought this was a button. Frenic Bow. Cool. Target distant enemies. So it's got long range. Pretty cool. All right. I think I just have to die, right? Yeah. All right. You can take it out of your mode only. I won. Hold on. No, this is OK, right? Yes, it's fine. Am I OK? Oh, yeah. All the all the believers. Yep. Believers win. Believers win. Yep. Believers give them the give them the win. Believers won. Believers win. Very cool. Spirit orb. So cool.

40
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:44,599
So cool. All right. So now I'm going to go do the quest. That was annoying. I like watching you discover day one speed run strats. OK. So besides that regular mission, I go into the pond. I'm going to look around the filthy pond. Yes. All right. I'm going to go check out the filthy pond.

41
00:27:44,599 --> 00:28:27,460
I just take something off. Wait, what did I just take off? Yeah, I want to just be able to know what that is. I was on the map. That's because it's not a stamp. Oh, my God. I'm the buttons. Oh, my God. I just wish A and B were flipped.

42
00:28:27,460 --> 00:29:01,509
What were this person's any stuff? No stuff in here. There's no stuff. You can't steal anything. So what's the point of having houses you can walk into? I'm just just just in a game play and just purely a game play setting.

43
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:27,779
What's the point of having houses if you can't steal like jewels from their chest? You can't sleep in the bed. You can't steal plates off the counter. What the heck? Oh, it's probably one of those. No. Heads up.

44
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:51,160
OK, what's down here? Anything cool in the pond? Oh, anything cool in the pond? No. There's got to be something cool near the pond, right?

45
00:29:51,160 --> 00:30:25,180
Arp. Anything of interest here? It was just a rusty sword. Whoa, wait, something interesting. What is this? Pray? You don't say you can hear my voice. Yes.

46
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:55,470
She trapped me in this stone statue long, long ago. Villagers here call me the horn statue and don't even bother to wipe away the bird droppings.

47
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:08,799
One would think years upon years of such treatment would have made me mend my ways. Does an audio desync? I'll fix it.

48
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:18,359
I've only been biding my time for the moment someone who can hear me appears, someone such as you. But I've said enough. Now then, shall we strike a bargain?

49
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:32,420
And stay that way. No further action on your part is required. Wait, that was mine. What? Um, excuse me. What just happened? Um, do I get that back?

50
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:45,970
That's not good. Ha ha ha ha. My touch is as subtle as ever. Note how I took that essence from you without leaving a mark. What? That's not fair.

51
00:31:45,970 --> 00:32:02,529
So wait, this thing just eats hearts? How do I get that back? All right, hold on. This isn't audio desync. Let me fix it. So you're saying when I go one, two, three, one, two, three, there is a delay.

52
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:25,339
There is? Okay. Is it on me to the gameplay or is the game audio is desynced? It's not my voice. Okay. The game audio itself is doing it. Hmm. Let me see.

53
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:37,940
The game audio has desynced from the game video. That's interesting. That's weird. Uh, let me see if I can fix it. So, okay. Are you? Is it happening late?

54
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:59,529
Like what? Do you hear the sound first and then I move it? Or do you hear the sound late? This one guy? Game visual is happening late. Hold on. If I can fix it, I will.

55
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:46,779
Let's ready? Check this out. Just check this out. Hold on. How's this? Perfect. So what? The horn statue took one of your containers. Well, what the fuck?

56
00:33:46,779 --> 00:34:00,059
Give it back. Did you think I deceived you? Parish the thought. I hope that ours will be a long and profitable relationship. So which will it be?

57
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:14,889
As I may have mentioned once or twice, I'm a dealer in life and power. I can provide a valuable service to you. I take heart containers or stamina vessels from you and then for a price return whichever of the two you like.

58
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:38,539
Oh, it's just if you want to. Okay. So if you want to put more points into stamina, you can. It's a respect. All right. Well, I don't want to do that. In fact, I probably should do heart again.

59
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:57,289
Next level up. Okay. Money and life are always one to me. If you're ready to begin, then first you must sell me either type of essence for 100 rupees. And then when you want to buy an essence back, it's 120 rupees.

60
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:10,699
Okay. Well, I'm not going to fuck up my build, so we're never going to talk ever again. Good day. Nice to meet you. We will never speak again.

61
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:45,460
Idiot fucking morning. All right. That's cool. That was that's what was over here. I'm going to mark this. We mark it as I don't know what's like a good point of interest. This should be I don't know.

62
00:35:45,460 --> 00:36:01,449
This is going to be but this means boss right skull to me is bad boss, not NPC. Maybe this like, oh, it's a leaf star. Maybe a star is probably a good idea. Yeah, that's a good one.

63
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:32,980
Okay, cool. Got that. What else is there to look at? I think I can just go do the quest, right? Are they quests in this game or are they missions? Are they quests? Go get a quest? Was it a objective mission? What's it called?

64
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:56,369
All right, I'm going to sell some. Maybe I can get some new armor. Oh, look at this. 250. Yeah, I want I want armor armor. Yeah. How much is this total? 180 250. That's 350 like 400.

65
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:07,800
Five. I like I was going to drop 700 dollars on the table and just walk away with this. I'm just going to go. I don't I'm not doing math. Just just keep it and leave. Well, I wouldn't have to do the math. They would.

66
00:37:10,769 --> 00:38:08,300
Whoops. All right. So who do I sell to? Why do you look like John from Garfield? What can I actually sell? I don't really have much to sell. Do you like food? Whoa, look at this is worth a lot. All my my gourmet dishes will get a lot of money. I'm just gonna sell everything. Oh, and I can. Sorry about those sapphires.

67
00:38:08,300 --> 00:39:21,730
Nobody knows what that is. Maybe one person doesn't. That's all I care about. Is it literally all I care about? All right. What about the amber? I'm going to sell some of these fish too. Who cares? Sell all. You're going to find tons of it anyways. Tons of amber. Are you sure? Sell all the gems. You're never going to use them. Really? I feel like that was a mistake. OK, sell it all. No, I don't. I'm not selling it all. I want this armor. There it is. Got it. I want the whole set. 200. Thank you.

68
00:39:24,179 --> 00:40:28,699
Please. I'm begging you. Sort your items there. They're exactly where I want them. Wait, I don't think I want this because this helmet is good, right? This is a climbing helmet. Yeah, I'm not. I'm keeping this. I have the Nintendo Switch shirt underneath it. No, you look like a dork. No, I don't. All right. I finally have armor. Does this weigh? Does it weight in the game? Do I have to worry about? Oh, you're going to be fat rolling or something. Die the armor now. Oh, cool dad. That'd be cool. There's no way. OK. Was the person that was dying stuff?

69
00:40:28,699 --> 00:41:04,079
There you are. All right. Right in front of me. To the right. Oh, dude. Oh, sick goat milk. No. All right. So what can I do? Let's die. Would you like to get back to square one? What do you mean square one?

70
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:50,880
Shouldn't I be Link? I can pretend I have the Switch shirt on or anything. Didn't they make a Legend of Zelda game where there were four links and they were each different? One was pink. One was green. One was blue.

71
00:41:50,880 --> 00:42:10,500
And it was kind of like a movie with all the emotions with the mad one. What was it called? Inside, right? The Four Swords. OK, so who was like the funny, goofy, like goofy one, right?

72
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:24,480
Because I want one of them was like sleepy. One of them was like grumpy. Which one of the links was the funny, goofy one? Is that Mike?

73
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:37,800
Is this not happening in the Four Swords? Wasn't it like, oh, one was like a sleepy one. One was grumpy. One was kind of like I'm thinking of the seven dwarves. But they did that, didn't they?

74
00:42:37,800 --> 00:43:03,610
That's not a thing in Four Swords. They didn't do like a red is angry. Blue is tired. Yellow is crazy or kooky. They didn't do that. That's Hyrule Warriors.

75
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:28,010
Somebody said, dude, you're thinking of parody animations. What? All right, well, I'm going to be light blue. Wait, five ingredients.

76
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:50,449
Have you ever done a sober stream? I was thinking about it. Is it worth? Are these things worth it? I feel like I need these. I don't care. Whatever.

77
00:43:50,449 --> 00:44:06,820
I'm thinking of Zelda, the Four Swords adventures on the GameCube. No, somebody said it's real. No, wait, we're talking about the mod chat.

78
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:26,610
The mod chat saying you guys are on crack. It's real. It's in the Four Swords. The game is real, but I don't think they have personalities like that, did they?

79
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:39,659
They were depicted as acting differently. Yeah, one of them was sleepy. One of them was hungry.

80
00:44:40,659 --> 00:45:01,670
One of them was dashing and one of them was vixen and whatever it was. The manga had flat out different personalities. Red was shy.

81
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:22,630
Purple was a cool guy. I told you I knew it. Why are you talking about the reindeer? I knew I did. I knew I had this right.

82
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:43,340
What happened to the quest that was here? Oh, I switched it. Okay. All right, let's see. I want to do Treasure Twilight Relic.

83
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:58,190
That seems kind of fun. Strange mask. What does EX mean? Ancient horse. Oh, this is DLC. Oh, all the side quest DLC.

84
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:20,480
Destroy Ganon. Free the Divine Beast. There are four. The Divine Beast. Okay. Yeah, this one here. I look cool now.

85
00:46:20,480 --> 00:47:05,900
The game came out in 2004. I knew I wasn't crazy. Where's your horse? I don't use the horse in this game. It's too hard to control.

86
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:22,519
You need a better horse. I'll find one. I need to level up. How far away is this? This is not that far. There's a purple cow.

87
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:31,690
Wait, they'll all pay. What do you want? Don't act so clueless. Although fine, you seem harmless enough. Forgive me.

88
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:37,690
I've just been on edge with all these monsters running around. They come up from Hateno Beach to steal my sheep.

89
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:50,340
If someone doesn't do something, I won't have any left. Let's go do that right now. It's right here. That's far away. No, too far. That's too far.

90
00:47:50,340 --> 00:48:16,699
That's way too far. That's way too far away. No, no, I'm not doing that. It's not too far if you had a horse. I'll get to the horse later.

91
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:46,590
That's a two-second walk. Can I actually make this without... I think I can, yeah. The map is not that big. It seems like it's pretty big.

92
00:48:46,590 --> 00:49:15,989
I think I'm just gonna make it. There we go. Okay, you are all the way out here. You are all the way out here.

93
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:30,179
What do these Minecraft signs say? Ancient tech lab. Enter at your own risk. It's bigger than Skyrim?

94
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:37,829
I don't really know the scale of Skyrim because I don't really like it. All right, here we go.

95
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:56,820
If the flame is blue, the furnace is hot. Don't touch it. Good morning. This is Hateno Ancient Tech Lab.

96
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:04,309
Do you have some business with the director? Yes, I do. The director's in the back. Terribly busy person, that one. Please try to keep it brief.

97
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:18,010
Good morning. I imagine you've never seen so many books in one place. Pretty incredible, isn't it? I mean, it's actually not that many.

98
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:24,659
We've gathered all of Hyrule's known literature on ancient civilizations here.

99
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:31,800
So the actual number of books, well, is that the thing on your waist? Is that a Sheikah?

100
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,420
There's no mistaking it. That's a real Sheikah Slate, isn't it? Never actually seen one in person.

101
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:47,190
If you could just show me the runes on it, I'd be most appreciative. Stasis, Magnesis, the remote bomb, and Rionis.

102
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:55,059
And what else? Let's see. Oh, that's it. But, hmm, strange. Doesn't seem like you have the basic runes.

103
00:50:55,059 --> 00:51:01,000
Why are they not there? Oh, where are my manners? I nearly forgot to introduce myself.

104
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:10,659
My name is Simon. You are Link, right? You know my name. Lady Impa caught me up to speed.

105
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:15,099
You see, we were told a young man holding a Sheikah Slate will appear and you must do all you can to help.

106
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:21,170
You'll be the hope that awakens from the slumber of restoration. His name will be Link. What's your name?

107
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:35,420
It's not my name. My name's Fred. Director, listen. Ms. Director, this is the real Sheikah Slate.

108
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:44,099
No, that's right. I haven't introduced our director. Ms. Pura happens to be right over there.

109
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:51,369
Ms. Pura is the world's foremost authority on ancient Hyrule culture.

110
00:51:51,369 --> 00:52:01,340
Wait, that was... Okay. Check it. I have the utmost respect for Ms. Pura and all she's accomplished.

111
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,340
I'm honored to be her assistant. On that note, Link, you see the director may look like a young girl,

112
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,579
but, well, maybe it's not my place to be telling you these things. You should talk to Ms. Pura herself.

113
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:24,760
Don't spill the beans. Do you guys have any money? I'm just looking for money.

114
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,920
Can I, like, reshuffle the books or whatever? Like, I just want some money.

115
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,739
The director of this laboratory is not Simon. It's me. Snapity snap.

116
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:39,489
Anyway, Linky.

117
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
Well, no matter. I'm just happy you're still in one piece.

118
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,269
What's with that look? You still remember me, right?

119
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:01,960
I don't remember.

120
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:18,690
Don't, sorry.

121
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:32,119
It's a charming quirk, isn't it?

122
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,860
I'm not gonna go read it. I don't care.

123
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,059
Anyway, enough about that. Back to the topic at hand.

124
00:54:07,059 --> 00:54:14,239
After a hundred years, here you are. Here to defeat Calamity Ganon, who is growing in strength with every passing moment.

125
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,769
And to rescue our beloved princess, Zelda, that is, if you've got the courage to try.

126
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:29,010
And to help the one true hero, I, the one and only Pura, will restore the basic functions missing from the Sheikah Slate.

127
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,599
So, cool. Do it.

128
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,599
I knew you were gonna say that. Alright, then. First, I need you to run an errand for me.

129
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,670
What's that look on your face? Well, I'm fine. That's actually what I came here to do.

130
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:46,010
I did not. You're pretty considerate.

131
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,179
But then I suppose that's because you're actually over a hundred years old.

132
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:51,809
Let me explain what this errand entails.

133
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:57,480
You know, the unlit furnace on the wall just outside this laboratory.

134
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,719
Could you please bring the blue flame from the ancient furnace in town?

135
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,019
Oh, and also use it to light our furnace.

136
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:11,809
I thought I said don't touch it.

137
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,809
This sweet little guidance stone will start working once you do that, allowing us to restore your missing runes.

138
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:22,360
Okay. Okay, then. I'm counting on you for that.

139
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,929
Alright, let's go get it. I'm going right now.

140
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,929
I'm gonna go as fast as I fucking possibly can.

141
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:33,739
Alright. If I ain't back in 30 minutes, it's free.

142
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:50,769
You can get a motorcycle?

143
00:55:50,769 --> 00:56:16,619
I'm just finding the urge so much to just go like...

144
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:20,179
Let's do a really loud annoying sheep sound.

145
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:23,059
It was eating me inside.

146
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:28,159
You know, I've done that once before.

147
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,159
I don't know. I hope I'm not, like, putting in fake memories.

148
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:36,159
But didn't I do that on stream once?

149
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,590
And people flipped out. People were pissed.

150
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,590
People were like, don't fucking do that again.

151
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,590
Like, that was not funny. It actually was annoying.

152
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,590
I swear to God that happened.

153
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,329
How do I pick it up?

154
00:56:50,329 --> 00:57:11,369
Alright, I got it. Does this count?

155
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:17,900
Make it a SBA torch?

156
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,099
I don't think I even have a torch.

157
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:28,820
Oh, I do. Okay.

158
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,409
Wait. This thing?

159
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:38,099
Oh, this is gonna be annoying.

160
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:43,219
It's gonna be worth it.

161
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:51,699
Just run. If I can't sprint, it blows out if I sprint.

162
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:55,480
God damn it. Hold it up, man.

163
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,480
I could have done that.

164
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,480
I could have held that up.

165
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:08,480
It's two feet of water, man.

166
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,619
I have a better idea.

167
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:24,739
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

168
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:28,099
What's the next one?

169
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:30,099
Is there one up there?

170
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:34,489
Is that one all the way up there?

171
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:49,639
What's the next one?

172
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:51,639
Just go find it. Alright.

173
00:58:51,639 --> 00:59:01,929
How long does this last?

174
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:24,900
Oh, I see one right there.

175
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
What's going on?

176
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,039
What the fuck is happening?

177
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:31,039
What is happening? Why is this fire?

178
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,039
Why am I on fire?

179
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:44,300
What?

180
00:59:44,300 --> 01:00:24,820
Okay, I need to just walk with it.

181
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,820
I'm just walking.

182
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,820
Put the bow away. I'm just walking.

183
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,820
Just walk with the torch.

184
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,820
Is this gonna blow out?

185
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,820
Does this blow out

186
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,820
if I run all the way up there? It's gonna be annoying.

187
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:48,630
Everyone's gonna laugh at me, but I'm losing my mind.

188
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:50,630
If anybody laughs at me for this,

189
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,630
I'm gonna ban you from my community.

190
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,769
Okay?

191
01:00:55,769 --> 01:00:57,769
You're gonna get banned from my community if you don't.

192
01:00:57,769 --> 01:00:58,769
I don't know.

193
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:05,659
Look, I redid it.

194
01:01:05,659 --> 01:01:07,659
What a strangely colored fire.

195
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:21,869
It's almost like an anglerfish's lure.

196
01:01:21,869 --> 01:01:26,530
Okay. Alright.

197
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:30,619
I'm back. No, I'm not.

198
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:38,050
Wait, where the hell am I going?

199
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:42,210
Wait, I gotta go so far?

200
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,539
Oh my god, I have to go all the fucking way up.

201
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:51,039
What do you mean, wrong way?

202
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,039
Oh my god, this is gonna be annoying.

203
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,840
There's no weird glitch that I can go like,

204
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,840
like, sk-sk-sket-sket-sket

205
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,840
grrrrrrrrrrrr

206
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,840
and fly like 100 miles per hour that way.

207
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:10,139
I actually have to walk.

208
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:16,789
I have to walk?

209
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:20,309
There is, but you're not skilled enough.

210
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:25,619
Wow, that's too bad.

211
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:32,730
It's not that far, it's fine.

212
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:45,210
I actually might not make this.

213
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:50,780
Don't go out, don't go out, don't go out.

214
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,780
Don't blow out, don't do it.

215
01:02:52,780 --> 01:03:07,239
Yes, we're good.

216
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:10,250
Okay. Now, you want me to light right here?

217
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:21,860
Travel gate. Oh cool. All right, so now you're gonna give me my runes

218
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:29,190
How do you feel about pride spam? I've never had it. I was like, I've never eaten it. Okay, take a look over there

219
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:31,710
There we go

220
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:37,679
Cool. Cool. So what does this do?

221
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:59,139
Basic runes. What'd I say? I said nah to what? Oh, I thought it was okay

222
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:13,530
Give me a I didn't I just wanted to say nah, I wanted to do it. I just turned around

223
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,530
I was just gonna put the thing in there

224
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:40,860
She hates you. All right, what do I get camera? Well, you just unlock the camera app new iOS update

225
01:04:43,300 --> 01:05:01,130
Camera. Oh the ancient runes the ancient runes

226
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:04,900
magnetism cryos

227
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,579
thesis

228
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:13,179
Stasis and camera app the ancient roots

229
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:26,340
What do I do with all this?

230
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:49,219
Creatures an iPhone 3 camera. Okay camera. I would definitely have to take a picture, right? Can you do selfie?

231
01:05:49,679 --> 01:06:37,190
Okay, no, no delete that. Oh my god. I hate this. All right, this is funny. Okay picture save an album. Sure

232
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:48,860
All right, that's gonna I that's gonna actually be fun. That's the most expressive link has ever been in a game

233
01:06:49,019 --> 01:07:11,480
Okay, let me see. Hmm. Who's this beautiful young creature? I'm deleting that immediately. I guess that's my cue

234
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,800
Sorry, I kind of lost it there. I wasn't on purpose

235
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,760
Hmm, and it's not just a pretty girl in these images. These are also some old landscape photos

236
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:30,769
So when somebody else's camera, I knew Princess Zelda had made frequent use of the camera feature what I have somebody else's photos

Wait, what it's a hand-me-down phone. They're your old photos

238
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:55,760
Okay, check in with Impa. She knows more about Princess Zelda than I ever did. Oh, yeah

239
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,199
There's just one more thing I need from you

240
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,400
You don't have to worry about this until after you see info

241
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,920
But I want you to bring me back some ancient materials

So this is the what the person took. Okay, what is this a picture of?

246
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:50,010
Is this the same tree five times? Well, you went to Disney on a slow day

247
01:09:50,010 --> 01:10:04,060
Holy shit, how the no people in these photos can you imagine getting a shot like this at Disney? Damn. All right

248
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:30,520
Oh, right. Okay. Now, let's play the video game the beach, right? It's Geo guesser. Look at that

255
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:46,859
I you can't turn how many photos am I allowed to have on my camera? By the way, I get rid of this shit

256
01:11:46,859 --> 01:12:06,720

257
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:25,180
This is a little strange, but whatever I don't think I should be able to run up this mountain

But I'm here. I am is raining. Oh, come on

01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:01,460
Make sure you take a selfie with Ganon. Yep. That's true

261
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:02,319
No

262
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:06,909
I need to say 48 images so I can just be in front of Ganon and

Just the way that world works. I can hear it. I can sense it

269
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,739
Two or three thousand people at the same exact time just said the same sentence, so it's been manifested

270
01:14:08,739 --> 01:14:20,789
I heard it my god. This is actually really far away. Whatever. Oh

That's in addition to the 48 other photos every item an enemy can have a photo attached. They don't take space

279
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:34,689
Okay, I get it so you're saying that if I go like this and take a picture of the luminous stone deposit

01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:49,000
That this is okay. This is not a photo now, but it says four look at this bullshit. It's up here

285
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,229

Can you make apple pie I mean I won't eat it, but I'll make it

290
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:55,750
If we're gonna talk about shitty food takes right I've gone over the I don't like apple pie routine right

291
01:19:56,470 --> 01:20:19,720
It is that one well that one's in the middle of the ocean. It's not a routine

292
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,050
Well hold on let me let me back up a little let me back up so

293
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:42,319
Apple pie is fine if there's vanilla ice cream on top if there's vanilla ice cream. That's on top

294
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,060
It's good, and it's I will eat it

295
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:52,119
Just a slice of apple pie without anything else. I don't like it. It's just I don't like it

296
01:20:52,479 --> 01:21:10,949
It doesn't taste bad, but I didn't needs vanilla ice cream on it like cat just gave birth

01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:51,229
Which had arrows right now

331
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:58,310

01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:21,399
I'm sick of solo queuing shoot the lantern. That was a bad voice crack as well. Yeah

Where's the lantern? I mean shoot that lantern up there. You got it, bro

334
01:30:29,109 --> 01:30:46,760

335
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,779
Fucking keyboard turning by the way. I need to make that faster

01:31:01,579 --> 01:31:13,960
Okay, how am I gonna kill these guys? Oh

338
01:31:51,369 --> 01:31:53,289
Shit, okay. Hold on

339
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:58,899
They're almost dead now. They can't take damage from this really I don't think

340
01:31:59,779 --> 01:32:10,399
Don't know what I was gonna say. Hope he doesn't get up here. All right eat something. Oh

Got him got him Knights broadsword only one more one more left. No weapon Andy. No weapon Andy. I win. Thank God. Oh

342
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:54,029
Internet problems starting again. Now that we're okay. We'll see this is another Knights broadsword

343
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:59,520
This thing's almost broken

344
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,520
But I want to throw it at somebody so I'm gonna get rid of the this yeah, this thing's a piece of shit

345
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,800
Why don't I still have this?

346
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:22,270
All right, what's in here? This is a pretty tough encounter. That's it. I mean, that's okay

347
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:42,060
This is a regular spear. Should I just get rid of the guardian sword? You can hit really fast with a spear

348
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:48,560
That's literally one of the best weapons in the whole game. Really? Yeah, I don't need this thing anymore

349
01:34:50,119 --> 01:35:05,489
So I'm gonna save this for a little bit. I have some pretty good weapons. I need more inventory slots. Yeah, I do

350
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:14,840
I really do desperately another one of these

351
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,920
God

352
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:21,279
Get rid of this I guess but this thing's not as good

353
01:35:22,979 --> 01:35:24,979
1520 just think fast

354
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,939
This thing's fast. What if I need a fast weapon? These are these are slow

355
01:35:28,539 --> 01:35:34,800
Yeah, the boomerang is sucks. Get rid of it. All right, I'll get rid of the boomerang

356
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:45,409
Okay, it's a boomerang. I forgot. That's cool though. Let me do that one more time

357
01:35:52,039 --> 01:36:06,979
Cool yeah, these night swords are 26 damage. Have you guys ever thrown a boomerang in real life?

358
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:15,810
They actually it's actually kind of hard. They just okay. I have been out in

359
01:36:16,529 --> 01:36:18,569
In a big open field, right?

360
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:23,920
Whipping just throwing a boomerang as hard as I can and this shit just goes straight

361
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:31,470
It doesn't come around it doesn't do anything if you throw a boomerang for real every time I've ever thrown one

362
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:35,789
It just kind of goes there and falls down. It doesn't go all the way around

363
01:36:36,189 --> 01:36:41,319
I feel like it'd be terrifying. Can you imagine that coming back?

364
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,619
How do you prepare for that it's just like oh shit, it's gonna hit me in the head

365
01:36:48,979 --> 01:36:56,659
How do you catch a boomerang? It's just did did did did did did did it's gonna literally get you in the head

366
01:36:56,659 --> 01:37:02,039
It's gonna kill you. You got to throw it, right?

367
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:10,949
I would imagine throwing that and you just see it but hit man briefcase glitching back towards you. No, dude

368
01:37:10,949 --> 01:37:13,310
I'm turning around I'm sprinting. I'm not gonna get hit by that

369
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:17,510
That's terrifying. No way

370
01:37:18,189 --> 01:37:25,659
Okay. All right the beach

371
01:37:25,699 --> 01:37:38,800
Wait, did I pick up the sword? Look at that 26 26 26. I got a lot of damage now. I'll go. Let's go with this

372
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:49,090
It's the worst one. Oh, there's a shrine. I forgot about the shrine. You're right with it. It's up all the way up, right?

373
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:56,220
Yep, they really do come back if you throw them, right? It's scary. Yeah, I don't want to do that

374
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:37,800
Yeah, can you do anything with the bull? You can ride the bull. No, you can't

375
01:38:43,369 --> 01:38:50,279
Well, it's gone. Why are you tan? I don't think I'm tan

376
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:55,869
I'm not tan. You can ride anything. That's awesome

377
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:04,949
All right. I finally made it

378
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:08,750
We're doing that shrine then we're doing that shrine and then I'll go do the main quest

379
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:19,210
There's shrine over there. You saw that right over there

380
01:39:41,369 --> 01:39:43,369
Yeah, I don't get it. It's okay

381
01:39:43,489 --> 01:39:47,390
It's gonna do this and then it's gonna remember this is how it works

382
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:52,229
It does this for like 30 40 minutes and then doesn't happen again for the rest of the day

383
01:39:52,430 --> 01:39:58,050
Just happen. I don't get it. It was just weird doesn't matter if it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon noon 10 o'clock at night

384
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:20,949
Just the way it is. What's on your right? Why do you keep looking on your right?

385
01:40:21,569 --> 01:40:23,569
Okay on my right I have

386
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:28,210
So I have thing that tells me how many frames I drop right there on this monitor

387
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:32,810
I have mod chat and then I also have the stream preview is up that way

388
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:37,029
So like well not the stream preview but the device that's I'm streaming with

389
01:40:37,289 --> 01:40:41,899
So I'm usually look from look if you see me looking over here. I'm looking at what's the stream health or?

390
01:40:42,739 --> 01:40:47,060
Mod chat if I'm looking over here. I'm reading you your chat

391
01:40:47,060 --> 01:41:06,039
Um, you know, I got a whole battle station here. Okay, so let's go. What's this puzzle?

392
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:13,390

394
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:30,250
This thing is broken already

395
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:44,949
So this doesn't fucking hurt no, don't take a picture

396
01:41:48,289 --> 01:42:02,520
I'm dead instantly. Okay, I gotta probably parry it. It's a parry, right? It's definitely a parry. It's a boom

397
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:16,439
So parry is how do you do parry? You have to be I have the shield equipped

398
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:24,720
How do I put this in? How do I put okay, and then it's this in r1

399
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:41,239
Listen, how do you how do you parry? I have a shield out and is it how do you parry computer?

400
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:49,399
Please should play please place a celery man, please. Hey

401
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:59,029
Oh

402
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:23,399
You broke my shit

403
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:59,229
Barely hurting this thing

404
01:44:24,449 --> 01:44:55,229
Can you I can't parry that I just have to fight this is not worth it to be honest

405
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:07,119
Okay, so when it goes like

406
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:18,850
You're gonna I dodged it you saw me jump in the air I fucking dodged that I actually did

407
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:34,619
Everything is breaking against this person

408
01:45:48,989 --> 01:46:01,979
Flurry rush incoming

409
01:46:07,579 --> 01:46:09,579
Do that didn't fucking even hurt him

410
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:18,960
I'm just breaking all my weapons on this

411
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:25,649
This is actually terrible. I'm gonna break all my weapons. Everything's gonna break

412
01:46:26,829 --> 01:46:31,609
Every weapon I'm gonna I all this cool stuff

413
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:44,760
Use the best weapons. I feel like as if this is bad

414
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:15,560
I

415
01:47:25,979 --> 01:47:28,140
Was gonna say what the fuck was that

416
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:36,829
Where's my flurry rush? Excuse me. I

417
01:47:37,710 --> 01:48:14,399
Thought you had to interrupt it. I thought I had to land on top of them to interrupt it

418
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:25,840
All right. I got it. We'll be good. I got it. Now. I got it. Now. This is it

419
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:51,159
This is the one that usually works your bed and play too much Dark Souls. I pressed our three to lock on

420
01:48:51,760 --> 01:49:33,930
Flurry rush incoming. Oh my goodness. Oh

421
01:50:25,859 --> 01:51:06,300
Well, what does this do this is stealth boost jump and open the parachute now don't do it again

422
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,600
I

423
01:52:06,119 --> 01:53:07,180
Am not getting one hit killed just eat the gross food and puke. I don't care. Go ahead. Do it again. Do it again

424
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:29,869
That's not I you have to be directly on top of this fucking head do it again you piece of crap

425
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:35,979
But this is different. Am I safe behind this?

426
01:53:36,579 --> 01:53:42,220
I'm safe behind this right? They'd know there's no way I'm gonna be I'm gonna lie behind this right my dad

427
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:52,270
Shoot it in the face

428
01:53:52,310 --> 01:54:16,579
Okay, um, do I have any more food? I'm fucked. Just eat the snails dude. I don't understand

429
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:45,239
I think I'm dead. I

430
01:54:45,439 --> 01:55:08,000
Didn't know when he was gonna fire. I didn't know. I didn't know when he was gonna shoot it

431
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:18,989
Fuck. Okay. I get it now. It's over this time. You're so bad. It hurts

432
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:23,970
I have never fought these things. This is the first time I've fought one of these. Of course

433
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:25,970
I don't know what the hell I'm doing

434
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:31,939
How am I supposed to know I don't have the knowledge of beating this before

435
01:55:31,939 --> 01:55:35,399
I don't know if the laser does that

436
01:55:35,399 --> 01:55:39,640
The knowledge of beating this before I don't know if the laser does

437
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:45,630
And I should have flurried right there and you know it

438
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:32,899
Why is that not working that was a perfect

439
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:42,239
Junk it's backwards not sideways. Wait, you can only do it when it's backwards only a backflip does that I wait only a backflip

440
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:50,750
What I thought it was just you if you dodged it either side

441
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:54,319
I thought it was like doesn't didn't matter as long as you got a perfect dodge

442
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,760
It's only on backwards

443
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:02,529
With a horizontal attack because there's no iframes

444
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:22,600
You gotta be fucking kidding me. All right, so I did I thought it didn't I didn't think it mattered

445
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:29,300
I did. All right. I didn't know I thought those iframes

446
01:58:16,460 --> 01:59:21,819
Okay, I got it holy shit ancient battle axe plus what

447
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,760
guardian shield plus

448
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:51,119
No way. No put this away. I'm never I'm literally never using these until the last boss fight something else in here, too

449
01:59:51,520 --> 02:00:33,500
Whoa better not be no, I don't want to do that. I want to throw the bow. Let's drop it. This game's fun

450
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:39,069
I like it. That was a challenge. It was it took me a minute to figure it out, but I got it

451
02:00:39,069 --> 02:00:56,369
Um, this is fun. I think that's my second one got a shrine right down here

452
02:00:56,369 --> 02:01:19,340
By the way shrine down here before I get out of here is something else. I should look up

453
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:29,569
Check out up here. It's kind of sits alone on the mountain top here. What is this tonoko island?

454
02:01:29,569 --> 02:01:34,229
I think that's where I'm going. I

455
02:01:34,909 --> 02:01:44,199
Think that's actually where I'm going right now. Yeah, it definitely is. Oh, all right

456
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:52,140
Hmm. I want that trying

457
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,100

458
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:26,029
Oh

459
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:35,340

02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:17,369
Combat trial. Oh god another one of these is the same. It's another one of those guardian things. Okay, it's the same thing

466
02:04:17,369 --> 02:04:19,680
Just do it again. I just have to do it again

467
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:57,840
You just you have an extra weapon. That's fine. I'm gonna run out of weapons. I think this is bad

468
02:05:06,439 --> 02:05:41,369
What if I run out of weapons? Can I hurt don't I just blew up one of the things? Oh my god

469
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:48,520
Every button in my brain is remapped to dark souls. Our one is attack our

470
02:05:49,590 --> 02:06:00,449
Prussian our three is dodge. I mean is it lock on I have dark souls brain. It's genuinely dark souls brain

472
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:43,279

473
02:06:43,520 --> 02:07:23,100
I'm gonna scream as loud as I fucking can I thought that was gonna be vertical use that why I'm gonna help at all. I

474
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:54,829

02:07:54,829 --> 02:08:02,319
Pressed left. I'm pressing left and dodge. Why am I jumping backwards controller sucks?

476
02:08:10,220 --> 02:08:30,489
Dude, I hate the joy con. I'm doing my YouTube angry voice is doing pretty good, right?

477
02:08:30,970 --> 02:09:06,630
I'm not trying to jump backwards. Why does it keep doing that? I swear to god. This is drift

478
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:14,529
It's now it's not the drift use the pro controller

479
02:09:14,529 --> 02:09:21,850
I why I don't want to buy something else and use it because they didn't package the better controller in

480
02:09:21,850 --> 02:09:40,340
I'm not gonna buy the pro controller for the switch two of them. You're doing a Kubrick's dare every time you play

481
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:47,050
Sitting there like this. See if I can beat this guy with the Kubrick's dare. I

482
02:09:48,090 --> 02:10:52,250
Don't know what that means. Oh god run. It's it is

483
02:10:53,250 --> 02:11:09,100
What it's broken. It's broken. Oh

02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,699
Shit, that's bad

02:11:13,699 --> 02:11:17,350
He's not even a half way

486
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:19,270
I

487
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:37,189
Space to bullshit. What's the face to bullshit? Same thing, but it's a weirder. Oh

488
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:47,699
Nice miss you idiot

489
02:14:15,869 --> 02:14:24,460
I'm so paranoid about missing that

490
02:14:39,369 --> 02:14:43,479
What was that what happened what the

491
02:14:44,199 --> 02:14:53,909
Oh

492
02:14:53,989 --> 02:15:12,069
There we go, oh my god, he's doing that thing

493
02:15:12,789 --> 02:15:14,670
What's the strategy here?

494
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:16,720
What's the strategy here?

495
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:27,750
What's the strategy here? Shoot his I just run in a circle. Just run in a circle

496
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:31,710
Period I'm not gonna parry this. I don't have the

497
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:36,010
Skill for that Harry or run around I'm gonna run around

498
02:15:47,399 --> 02:16:15,670
Oh

499
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:54,690
Man that's pretty good one

500
02:17:56,110 --> 02:18:08,809
Ancient battle axe super double plus 60 damage a fucking swing guardian sword double plus 40 damage a swing ancient core

501
02:18:09,229 --> 02:18:12,360
Very valuable to researchers. Oh

502
02:18:13,450 --> 02:18:21,090
That's cool. All right. Hold on. Look at that. I got a full set of diamond gear. I got the diamond pickaxe

503
02:18:21,090 --> 02:18:41,840
I got the diamond sword. I got the diamond hoe even I'm loaded save that core

504
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:49,600
Do not cook it don't sell it. Don't eat it. Why would I eat the core you can eat it? Don't cook that

505
02:18:49,639 --> 02:18:53,079
Don't the mods are I'm getting a lot of mod help here

506
02:18:53,079 --> 02:19:09,979
I was told do not cook that or sell that okay, you've been eating gears. Ooh

507
02:19:17,059 --> 02:19:24,879
Really? What's the defense on this? This is good. Oh

508
02:19:25,719 --> 02:19:40,920
Hell yeah, I got the climbing gear. This is really I can sell this now. All right, cool. That's way better

509
02:19:40,920 --> 02:19:43,399
It's only one defense less and I get the climbing ability

510
02:19:45,309 --> 02:20:06,090
I'm gonna call me a shit eater

511
02:20:06,329 --> 02:20:17,319
Who said that I'm not I'm not gonna I don't know they're in here somewhere if you get the full climbing set you go

512
02:20:17,319 --> 02:20:27,370
Much faster starting to understand this game now starting to get it. No, I get it. I get it

513
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:36,799
I get it these little challenge shrines with with cool items in them. I get it. It's like my favorite part of the game so far

514
02:20:37,319 --> 02:20:47,809
Who's that?

515
02:20:47,809 --> 02:21:02,469
Okay, I want to get on the boat saying I can get on the boat and do this, right?

516
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:26,250
Wouldn't this work when it goes this way?

517
02:21:26,250 --> 02:21:32,510
Wouldn't it that's when

518
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:39,920
This is how it would work the air would be moving this way, right? Oh

519
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:46,670
It has to go to

520
02:21:47,229 --> 02:21:50,190
Okay, all right. I'm thinking of like a jet propulsion

521
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:54,989
I was like I'm gonna aim this way and go air that way so we go this way like an octopus swims

522
02:21:56,430 --> 02:21:59,469
All right, why oh over the island let's go

523
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:03,520
Over the island, let's go

524
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:36,729
Under the boat get up both of you just fucking die. They drop anything good. Ooh

525
02:22:42,219 --> 02:22:44,059
Dragon bone bow

526
02:22:44,059 --> 02:23:03,270
Two ingredients. Okay, cool. What do I have? That's a piece of shit. Probably one of these can't drop it

527
02:23:03,549 --> 02:23:13,680
Don't go don't go go go go. Wait, wait, wait. Don't fly away. There's a chest in the ocean

528
02:23:17,319 --> 02:23:19,319
I'm fucking dead. I

529
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,799
Completely forgot about fucking death and well, no, I'm fine. I'm right here. We're good

530
02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:28,639
I thought I was gonna get teleported somewhere. That was such an overreaction. I

531
02:23:34,739 --> 02:24:28,920
Pick it up. How do I get this? How do I haul that up? There Ramit? How do I pick this thing up?

532
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:54,530
How do you pick it up?

533
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:16,639
How do I get this chest Oh

534
02:25:25,909 --> 02:25:35,040
Okay, I get it. I don't act like you figured that out immediately people for hiding Santa Claus

535
02:25:35,639 --> 02:25:41,909
All the people doing Santa Claus is an evil to save the day

536
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:50,190
All right, so I'm gonna check out this island this game's fun

561
02:31:50,680 --> 02:32:07,770
These will be like cooked crabs, right? Yep. Okay

02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:43,360
Put it out. Put it out. Put it out gummy bears. What was that?

02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:24,770
Looking for shrines

573
02:34:24,770 --> 02:34:27,649

578
02:35:45,090 --> 02:36:03,829

24 damn. Okay, so I I don't I don't think I can kill this guy

582
02:36:40,579 --> 02:36:47,809
The bow dropped out though

583
02:36:47,889 --> 02:36:52,370
Because it looks like something attached

584
02:36:52,370 --> 02:36:54,610

585
02:37:08,309 --> 02:37:52,120

Is it too early? Is it too early to make my way over here and do one of these?

703
02:59:45,059 --> 02:59:51,909
I gotta go this way

704
02:59:51,909 --> 02:59:53,270
You can do it

705
02:59:53,270 --> 02:59:56,420
All right, that's right. Let me get a stamp so I can see where i'm going

706
02:59:56,819 --> 03:00:00,000
I'm gonna head that way. Where's my horse?

707
03:00:02,879 --> 03:00:05,760
I actually need my horse. I need a horse for something, right?

708
03:00:06,639 --> 03:00:08,709
I can sell a lot of shit

709
03:00:08,709 --> 03:00:13,489
Let me just prepare

710
03:00:13,489 --> 03:00:30,879
Hold on. I gotta get I gotta get my brain juice. Actually i'm gonna i'm gonna take a piss too. I'll be back in like two minutes

711
03:02:50,500 --> 03:02:52,020
Yeah, no, thank you

712
03:02:52,020 --> 03:02:55,200
No, this is good. This is great

713
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:59,030
Yeah, I just have to pretend to like this fucking shitty game still

714
03:02:59,750 --> 03:03:01,350
Thank you

715
03:03:01,350 --> 03:03:04,420

716
03:03:05,379 --> 03:03:13,440
Unmute. Hey, what's up? Uh, i'm back everybody just uh, ready i'm excited

717
03:03:32,309 --> 03:03:38,229
I've done that stupid routine so many times. Come on, you're not gonna fall for it for like the tenth time

718
03:03:38,229 --> 03:03:44,440
Are you I do it all the time?

719
03:03:45,010 --> 03:03:47,409
It's I do it so much that it's probably

720
03:03:48,309 --> 03:03:55,809
You can probably tell at this point. All right, can I get confirmed from the gaming andes?

721
03:03:57,379 --> 03:03:59,459
That I can sell these opals

722
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:01,780
I can sell these

723
03:04:01,840 --> 03:04:06,760
Luminous stones and shit. I I can just get rid of these. I don't need them right now. It's just money

724
03:04:15,590 --> 03:04:27,959
Keep one of each. Okay, i'm gonna keep more than one of each

725
03:04:28,440 --> 03:04:34,680
I don't think I really need the money like that bad

726
03:04:40,719 --> 03:04:43,409
What else what can I even buy with this?

727
03:04:46,149 --> 03:04:48,149
Is there something I I could buy?

728
03:04:48,690 --> 03:04:53,559
Maybe what about a bunch of arrows? How can you play from a library?

729
03:04:57,110 --> 03:05:13,250
What do you mean? Yeah, i'm gonna get arrows but there's also stuff here too, okay, this is milk ingredient in soups

730
03:05:14,190 --> 03:05:16,620

731
03:05:16,639 --> 03:05:19,280
Truffles, oh people were talking about truffles eggs

732
03:05:20,399 --> 03:05:24,559

733
03:05:24,559 --> 03:05:27,459

03:05:27,459 --> 03:05:30,079
All right. I'll get some milk. Oh

736
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:39,540
Why are we talking about a library?

737
03:05:40,180 --> 03:05:51,430
Should I should I get milk eggs and like can I make a cake or something?

738
03:05:52,069 --> 03:06:06,020

03:06:30,469 --> 03:06:33,670
Get sugar milk eggs and wheat will that work?

745
03:06:42,559 --> 03:06:51,909
Who sells sugar that's rice

746
03:06:52,629 --> 03:06:56,340
Well, i'm kind of out of money anyways

747
03:07:00,549 --> 03:07:02,549
Ah, this is a weapon shop

748
03:07:05,299 --> 03:07:22,069
Oh, no, it's a oh, no, no, no. All right. You need wheat cane sugar goat butter and an apple

749
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:24,469
Make apple pie

750
03:07:24,469 --> 03:07:31,670
First has a quest wasn't I supposed to go to the beach for somebody and I forgot completely

751
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:45,110
All right. Should I do that?

752
03:07:45,510 --> 03:07:50,500
Okay, there's probably a treasure on the mountain

753
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:55,110
Mysterious place. All right add it to the list

754
03:07:57,440 --> 03:07:59,329
Are you reading?

755
03:07:59,329 --> 03:08:01,329
Um, but i'm sneezing

756
03:08:01,969 --> 03:08:16,549
And very shortly

757
03:08:16,549 --> 03:08:18,709
Take one picture of everything

758
03:08:19,430 --> 03:08:26,899
Is what i'm being told

759
03:08:26,899 --> 03:08:28,739
Everything like even the grass

760
03:08:28,739 --> 03:09:04,159
What does it not know why is it still saying question mark?

761
03:09:04,799 --> 03:10:02,159
Okay, this is donkey over here donkey. Okay. Let me make a uh, you need that. Yes, I do take it

762
03:10:02,479 --> 03:10:07,090
I'll explain to the villagers you eat your fill. All right. Let me cook some stuff. What do we got?

763
03:10:08,120 --> 03:10:10,120
I know I have at least a few things to make

764
03:10:11,219 --> 03:10:22,930
All right snail. Okay steak fish steak

765
03:10:23,889 --> 03:10:37,780
Milk and eggs steak and fruit steak and apple was pretty good. Right steak and salt. Okay

766
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:52,260
steak salt more than one salt milk steak should I do it milk and

767
03:10:53,139 --> 03:11:45,239
Truffle truffle oil five times salt. That's enough fire. Um, why is it enough? How do I get you need a light?

768
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:56,389
Why would there not be any light source or anything over here? You can use flint

769
03:11:56,790 --> 03:12:11,329
How do I use it strike it with a metallic weapon to generate a spark?

770
03:12:16,229 --> 03:12:37,030
It has to just be on the ground. Okay steak and a bunch of salt

771
03:12:48,790 --> 03:13:00,600
Fucking waste of ingredients. Why did somebody tell me to do that? That was such a stupid thing to do

772
03:13:01,079 --> 03:13:03,079
All right. How about this?

773
03:13:04,629 --> 03:13:09,379
Cooking this into a meal unlocks the potential of these nutrients. Can I do fish and honey?

774
03:13:09,780 --> 03:13:13,459
Try just cook them individually

775
03:13:13,459 --> 03:13:23,329
Should these always be cooked individually don't mix effects. Okay, so but if I go like this with one fish

776
03:13:24,389 --> 03:13:26,389
It's gonna be one heart

777
03:13:27,799 --> 03:13:29,319
Or will it be better?

778
03:13:29,319 --> 03:13:39,780
That's two. Okay. So then two fish would be four hearts, right? And i'll put a mushroom in there. Why not?

779
03:13:40,020 --> 03:13:59,329
Okay, honey and

780
03:13:59,329 --> 03:14:07,350
All right. How about this another fish? Okay when it's cooked into a dish it increases your attack power

781
03:14:07,430 --> 03:14:20,399
So let's do that another mushroom. We can't do two right fish honey and apples

782
03:14:20,879 --> 03:14:30,680
Will this be good? Don't mix stats. So this is

783
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:39,239
Stamina this is also stamina. This is just fine

784
03:14:39,799 --> 03:14:46,360
It says nuts and then this is

785
03:14:47,959 --> 03:15:00,680
Attack power so I don't want to do that. Okay defense

786
03:15:02,559 --> 03:15:16,790
Stamina, so this would be huge. Let's try this. Whoa

787
03:15:20,440 --> 03:15:22,120
That's cool

788
03:15:22,120 --> 03:15:29,000
So let's this is stealth. So this is a stealth

789
03:15:31,620 --> 03:15:41,799
Any more stealth any more stealth food heart recovery?

790
03:15:47,030 --> 03:15:58,180
Maximum hearts. This is just eggs. I'll put some wheat in there, too

791
03:16:07,299 --> 03:16:16,610
Stealth boost sneaky fried egg and rice. Maybe let's just make a few of these

792
03:16:20,500 --> 03:16:23,329
right and then

793
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:55,030
Attack power more add salt to and more eggs. I have eggs don't I double salt double wheat

794
03:16:59,409 --> 03:17:20,739
Add some bacon in it and an apple. Nice. Okay. I'm gonna have a lot of good food

795
03:17:21,540 --> 03:17:43,649
Okay, egg milk salt wheat fish. This is defense. It's gonna be huge five minutes of defense

796
03:17:43,969 --> 03:18:01,889
So we said cook an individual truffle make a creamy mushroom risotto. Oh, wow. Holy shit

797
03:18:05,350 --> 03:18:16,120
Why wouldn't I just only do this? Are you kidding me? That's insane full recovery

798
03:18:20,500 --> 03:18:30,930
And two spirit hearts. What about this shit grease your heart recovery when you use this as an ingredient

799
03:18:31,010 --> 03:18:41,200
All right, so let's do two of these some milk an egg and another another glass of milk. Let's have let's make a uh,

800
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:49,250
Let's pick up a coconut stew. Wait, hold on

801
03:18:49,729 --> 03:19:00,079
Let's not put some salt in it. No, no salt. This is gonna be like a cake milk fruit and egg. It's gonna be like a

802
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:02,399
stew

803
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:21,600
And I made an omelet. Okay, what does this do? All right, whatever. I'll just do this

804
03:19:28,389 --> 03:19:36,040
Very good. Now i'm ready. Look at all the food I have now. I mean some of the stuff is gross, but that's fine

805
03:19:36,120 --> 03:19:40,610
I have so much stuff now. Thank god

806
03:19:42,790 --> 03:19:44,799
Okay

807
03:19:44,799 --> 03:19:51,860
Now that i'm prepared that way it's time to move to the divine beast

808
03:19:52,260 --> 03:20:18,930
Press please sort it press y to sort it didn't do anything. Is it by rarity or something? Go level up. Oh

809
03:20:19,569 --> 03:20:29,909
Do I have four? I think I only have three. What about the beach quest?

810
03:20:32,659 --> 03:20:37,889
Shit, yeah. All right, i'll do the beach quest fine. I'll do the beach quest

811
03:20:38,450 --> 03:21:08,979
Let's go preparation is the most important thing in breath of the wild. That's what i've been told

812
03:21:11,969 --> 03:21:14,530
Packed buffs are great for bosses or tough enemy camps

813
03:21:16,159 --> 03:21:23,440
Also, you're doing way too much healing for your current hp look smaller dishes. You're not wasting ingredients. Oh, that's right. I didn't think about that

814
03:21:29,940 --> 03:21:31,940
Yeah, one of those is it heals 10 hearts

815
03:21:32,659 --> 03:21:34,659
That's a little too much. I think

816
03:21:34,899 --> 03:21:39,639
Can you see me a lullaby? Yeah, I think so. I think I could give singing a lullaby

817
03:21:40,280 --> 03:21:46,389
what

818
03:22:21,879 --> 03:22:31,440
We're floating all the way there that's somebody just said that's the final straw

819
03:22:35,379 --> 03:22:39,959
What are you talking about?

820
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:42,360
Uh-oh, I have not been paying. Oh, I gotta do this

821
03:22:46,229 --> 03:22:49,000
It worked

822
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:51,000
All right, dude, that's the last straw

823
03:22:51,159 --> 03:22:56,610
Come out of here

824
03:22:56,610 --> 03:22:58,290
Okay, so let's do it

825
03:22:58,290 --> 03:23:04,340
I'm ready. I got some good weapons. Maybe I should eat one of the stamina foods

826
03:23:27,350 --> 03:23:35,829
What are they fighting? Why are you fighting me? What are they doing? I'm trying to save them

827
03:23:47,489 --> 03:24:15,219
Holy shit that hurt

828
03:24:15,219 --> 03:24:49,159
Oh my god, your reach is insane. Ooh

829
03:24:58,870 --> 03:25:17,170
What the fuck enhanced?

830
03:25:17,809 --> 03:25:26,579
Lizzle spear. Okay. So now what do I got? I gotta get rid of some of this shit

831
03:25:30,870 --> 03:25:42,680
I'll use it. Spears are really good. This one seems really good. Okay

832
03:25:53,079 --> 03:26:13,479
I still have so much trouble judging how far this goes. I don't even think about it

833
03:26:31,590 --> 03:26:37,170
Oh my god, that's fucking such a what a youtuber seriously like honest to god

834
03:26:37,889 --> 03:26:39,889
Don't fucking die because you're a youtuber

835
03:27:03,639 --> 03:27:29,600
Got it. Okay

836
03:27:29,600 --> 03:27:32,079
So now

837
03:27:32,079 --> 03:27:33,760
I believe

838
03:27:33,760 --> 03:27:36,520

Well, i'll deal with them in a second. Can I like move them?

840

Uh-huh grabs. All right. So what do I do with the sheep?

03:32:40,600 --> 03:32:44,530
So what's another good one?

867
03:32:44,610 --> 03:32:46,850
Um, how many

868
03:32:46,930 --> 03:32:50,530
Is this what you do with this stuff or is there other things you can do with the ancient materials?

869
03:32:56,360 --> 03:33:01,319
Stasis or the sensor just do them all if I can there are other things. Okay

870
03:33:01,959 --> 03:33:08,420
All the stasis I use stasis pretty frequently. I don't have it. Oh

871
03:33:11,750 --> 03:33:14,959
How about the sensor?

872
03:33:14,959 --> 03:33:43,909
Yeah, let's do it. Oh talk to the sheep owner. Yeah, i'm just getting this out of the way. This is um

873
03:33:45,750 --> 03:33:49,829
I like games like this because I feel like I haven't done anything but I feel like i've done a lot

874
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:54,159
I feel like I have not done a single thing yet

875
03:33:54,159 --> 03:34:07,159
But somehow I am okay if your sensor has been augmented to search for things other than shrines

876
03:34:07,559 --> 03:34:15,440
It reacts when you are close to the thing you have set it to look for so you can make it look for other stuff

877
03:34:16,719 --> 03:34:23,479
Okay, cool

878
03:34:23,479 --> 03:34:27,319
You can now search for anything you take a picture of that's why you're taking the photos. Oh

879
03:34:34,719 --> 03:34:40,079
That's actually really helpful. All right

880
03:34:41,729 --> 03:34:43,969
The sheikah sensor plus I really want to see it

881
03:34:48,370 --> 03:35:00,770
Take a look picture of a sun shroom with the camera

882
03:35:29,489 --> 03:35:39,090
Okay, i'm pressing b

883
03:35:39,350 --> 03:35:55,670
But it's you have to hit x b is universal back. I did get one. Okay using that in the rain

884
03:35:55,750 --> 03:35:57,270
Yeah, that's probably a bad idea

885
03:35:57,270 --> 03:36:20,790
Okay, give me three sun shrooms. So

886
03:36:21,430 --> 03:36:23,889
All right. So here we are

887
03:36:23,889 --> 03:36:34,399
The album we're looking for that's these are not pictures of the bow is they're pictures of me

888
03:36:34,879 --> 03:36:58,389
Okay, so target with sensor searching for sun shrooms. Okay

889
03:37:00,840 --> 03:37:04,920
So that's gonna blink when i'm near a sun shroom now very interesting

890
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:19,190
Yep, the one back here

891
03:37:19,190 --> 03:37:20,790
sun shroom

892
03:37:20,790 --> 03:37:22,790
All right. So then now just have to look for him

893
03:37:26,069 --> 03:37:29,409
Oh

894
03:37:29,409 --> 03:37:31,409
That's I like that feature a lot. That's cool

895
03:37:32,049 --> 03:38:09,600
Is there another one over here? Go to that light go to that beam go to that beam. What is it?

896
03:38:09,920 --> 03:38:51,010
It could be rare now go get it. I thought that was a marker that I put down

897
03:38:51,090 --> 03:38:53,090
I thought that was one of those beacon things

898
03:38:54,239 --> 03:38:56,639
When I looked on the map, I was like wait a minute. I didn't put that down

899
03:39:03,190 --> 03:39:05,190
I have a gold one on the map

900
03:39:06,340 --> 03:39:08,340
This ends at 5 a.m. Dude, hurry up

901
03:39:10,049 --> 03:39:21,680
What?

902
03:39:21,680 --> 03:39:26,079
Lighting is ooh, there's um, was it unobtainium? Whatever it is

903
03:39:47,670 --> 03:39:50,610
Frank it's not like the uh

904
03:39:51,409 --> 03:39:53,409
What's the other force from the other games?

905
03:39:54,739 --> 03:40:18,500
You have to be within the same zone or something. I think frank is dead really

906
03:40:19,139 --> 03:40:21,120
That would be kind of sad

907
03:40:21,120 --> 03:40:35,250
All right. So what is this?

908
03:40:35,329 --> 03:41:12,239
Is it doesn't work?

909
03:41:20,920 --> 03:41:26,100
Star fragment mysterious stone fragment that fell from the sky looks like it would fetch a good price

910
03:41:26,180 --> 03:41:28,100
But you may be able to use it in a certain recipe

911
03:41:30,159 --> 03:41:33,680
All right. Nice

912
03:41:33,680 --> 03:41:39,319
So now what what do I want to go from here? Probably fast travel back to here. Oh, I need the shrooms, right?

913
03:41:39,799 --> 03:41:46,399
I wipe this out. I need to go back to the village and I have to talk to

914
03:41:47,440 --> 03:41:53,840
Yeah, hold on cook it

915
03:41:56,930 --> 03:42:04,389
What if you cook the star? Do you make a black hole in high rule kingdom and ever get sucked into it?

916
03:42:17,569 --> 03:42:19,569
Okay, I need to find a couple more shrooms

917
03:42:20,049 --> 03:42:25,559
apparently a few nearby

918
03:42:25,559 --> 03:42:27,559
They're probably down here

919
03:42:37,700 --> 03:42:52,530
Really?

920
03:42:52,770 --> 03:43:00,180
Where are these mushrooms that what do you mean nearby? They're not nearby

921
03:43:37,010 --> 03:44:01,399
What the fuck are these things? Oh, hey there

922
03:44:04,420 --> 03:44:26,040
All right. I got three, right? That's what you needed. I got a lizard iron shroom and a bunch of these too

923
03:44:26,440 --> 03:44:59,510
Okay, I got a lot of these. I thought this is live. How much is enough of any given material like 10 20

924
03:45:03,700 --> 03:45:27,719
Finding new objective. It's never enough 25. I think that's good enough to turn this in

925
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:50,290
Can you just watch funny videos instead of playing this dude? Can I can just like watch some funny videos?

926
03:46:11,170 --> 03:46:24,020
Ooh, that was worth it. I think i've got some news that should be music to your ears

927
03:46:24,899 --> 03:46:28,180
Found a way to help you search for new objects using the sheikah sensor plus

928
03:46:29,670 --> 03:46:31,670
Uh show excitement

929
03:46:31,670 --> 03:46:36,950
Okay, I was doing some research. I felt there were some pictures of the past left on the guidance stone

930
03:46:37,860 --> 03:46:39,459
You add those pictures

931
03:46:39,459 --> 03:46:42,100
To the compendium you can search where did you went over this?

932
03:46:42,659 --> 03:46:46,579
Oh

933
03:46:46,579 --> 03:47:04,610
Didn't we already go over this drop one of those and take a photo. That's a great idea

934
03:47:08,850 --> 03:47:17,680
What are we doing?

935
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:34,760
Doesn't sherman know that he has to eat a bug since he made 10 dark souls references

936
03:47:39,440 --> 03:47:41,440
That was never set in stone

937
03:47:41,760 --> 03:47:44,260
I have to eat a bug. What bug?

938
03:47:46,100 --> 03:47:48,579
When did I I didn't make 10 dark souls references?

939
03:47:56,950 --> 03:48:02,209
You name me 10 dark souls references and i'll believe you. Okay

940
03:48:03,909 --> 03:48:07,559
Please be a centipede

941
03:48:07,639 --> 03:48:30,450
God damn it. No enough. Is this the sus guy? Yeah. Yeah

942
03:48:41,840 --> 03:48:43,840
I should probably not have these

943
03:48:44,159 --> 03:48:55,489
mushrooms anymore, right? Although

944
03:48:56,209 --> 03:48:57,729
Okay, let me do this

945
03:48:57,729 --> 03:49:03,920
Where's the truffle watch this? So somebody said you could do this

946
03:49:07,059 --> 03:49:16,719
Truffle now I can find truffles, which that's pretty cool. That's a good idea

947
03:49:17,280 --> 03:49:22,870
All right. Well, I definitely don't want it to be that so

948
03:49:23,680 --> 03:49:54,020
Uh, let's do it. How about I change it back to shrines you need to on the map? Okay

949
03:49:58,129 --> 03:50:03,809
All right. There we go. Cool

950
03:50:03,809 --> 03:50:40,149
Uh, I gotta talk to the lady at the town, right? You look like a truffle. Sorry. I wasn't looking I came back

951
03:50:40,549 --> 03:50:46,120
I'm ready for my reward your eternal reward

952
03:50:47,459 --> 03:50:50,180
All right. Uh, are you the one who took care of those monsters? It's me

953
03:50:53,270 --> 03:51:07,120
Maybe he did it not much of a reward. But hey, it's light that accounts. Oh fresh milk 10 milk

954
03:51:07,440 --> 03:51:32,020
I feel like that's pretty good. Uh reward. All right, what else do I got? All right, i'm gonna go this way

955
03:51:34,159 --> 03:51:51,299
Maybe I should go to kakariko village kakariko village get a horse and go up. That's what i'm gonna do

956
03:51:55,799 --> 03:51:58,149
Do you play elden ring?

957
03:51:58,149 --> 03:52:06,850
You're like a four month sub. I think you would you definitely know that already frank is on the map

958
03:52:07,090 --> 03:52:27,040
Oh, wait, no elden ring came out in february. Wow. Why does it feel like it came out like three months ago?

959
03:52:28,340 --> 03:52:34,760
February march april may june july august september. That's seven months ice. I'm corrected. I'm sorry

960
03:52:35,719 --> 03:52:41,319
I don't know. I let me pull that back. Wait frank is on the map. Wait frank is here

961
03:52:43,139 --> 03:52:58,819
What hold on that was wicked rude. Yeah, that was pretty rude. Yeah, i'm just like oh you should know

962
03:53:00,319 --> 03:53:02,719
You need to you should know that I streamed that

963
03:53:03,200 --> 03:53:06,530
That was dumb

964
03:53:06,530 --> 03:53:10,290
If you were a four month sub and you maybe you have only been here for five or six months

965
03:53:10,370 --> 03:53:21,170
Maybe you don't even know I played elden ring like one of my favorite games ever made except for uh radan

966
03:53:22,239 --> 03:53:24,239
Like the worst bite ever in the whole series

967
03:53:25,409 --> 03:53:27,409
All right. What where are you?

968
03:53:32,500 --> 03:53:34,500
How is frank not hearing me?

969
03:53:41,860 --> 03:53:44,500
That by the way, i'm i'm i played pre-patch

970
03:53:45,059 --> 03:53:46,659
pre-patch radan

971
03:53:46,659 --> 03:53:49,920
Don't ever forget that

972
03:53:49,920 --> 03:53:52,559
Is frank just free like out just free?

973
03:54:17,600 --> 03:54:20,479
Don't replace frank we need to find frank

974
03:54:41,280 --> 03:54:46,899
Frank

975
03:54:47,299 --> 03:54:49,600
What are you doing over here?

976
03:54:58,360 --> 03:55:01,170
Why is frank over here?

977
03:55:03,010 --> 03:55:03,809
Yeah

978
03:55:03,809 --> 03:55:15,520
No, no, don't go don't go. All right. Where's the stable frank? I'm sorry. I'm just gonna i'm gonna

979
03:55:26,790 --> 03:55:28,719
This horse is better

980
03:55:28,719 --> 03:55:30,840
It has three. Um

981
03:55:30,840 --> 03:55:31,719
Yes

982
03:55:31,719 --> 03:55:53,350
I'm keeping this one for now. Where's the stable? I wanted to go up. Where's the stable frank?

983
03:55:53,350 --> 03:55:57,540
Will just still be here. Okay, isn't it right next to me somewhere?

984
03:56:03,520 --> 03:56:14,180
Oh, there it is

985
03:56:14,180 --> 03:56:16,180
Yeah, this horse has three yes

03:56:38,200 --> 03:56:41,399
Um, what are you doing?

987
03:56:41,399 --> 03:56:45,780
Oh

988
03:56:45,780 --> 03:56:47,780
The horses control so strangely

989
03:56:48,420 --> 03:56:50,420
wait

990
03:56:59,200 --> 03:57:07,250
All right, you're smart you're very smart don't run too far

991
03:57:08,360 --> 03:57:35,040
Oh, that thing's a piece of shit. Never mind better than this

992
03:57:37,079 --> 03:57:46,659
Take a picture of the chest

993
03:57:46,659 --> 03:57:47,860
Oh

994
03:57:47,860 --> 03:57:56,450
That's cool. I feel you. Cool. All right, let me go back to the stable. Wait

995
03:57:57,680 --> 03:58:05,649
Is uh, aren't there like ancient screws and shit? Yeah, there is we're gonna go

996
03:58:06,370 --> 03:58:10,469
We're gonna leave now

997
03:58:24,000 --> 03:58:26,000
All right, we're safe

998
03:58:30,760 --> 03:58:43,079
This game's beautiful, isn't it? It is. Yeah, it looks great. Okay. I want this horse. This horse is stronger

999
03:58:43,799 --> 03:58:47,360
It's a little bigger

1000
03:58:47,680 --> 03:58:51,799
Yep

1001
03:58:51,799 --> 03:58:56,020
Oh, look at that three two and two much better

1002
03:59:22,739 --> 03:59:35,540
Let's go so now i'm ready i'm gonna teleport to here

1003
03:59:37,379 --> 03:59:41,479
The horse comes with me, right?

1004
03:59:41,479 --> 03:59:43,479
No, I want to take the horse, too

1005
04:00:04,079 --> 04:00:17,969
Yeah, I gotta talk to impa. Okay impa would have the answer right? All right, let's go talk to impa. Where's prank?

1006
04:00:18,610 --> 04:00:27,059
Frank too does not hear me. So I can't have a horse. I can't fast travel and then have a horse

1007
04:00:27,540 --> 04:00:54,200
Let's go on in the review. By the way, we need to run around but you seem just fine

1008
04:00:56,420 --> 04:00:58,420
Locked memento is complete

1009
04:00:58,899 --> 04:01:06,770
Now then let me see

1010
04:01:06,770 --> 04:01:09,409
Yeah, this is the camera that zelda used a hundred years ago

1011
04:01:16,209 --> 04:01:20,610
Could be that if you visit locations within those pictures, you'll be able to restore some of your lost memories

1012
04:01:21,250 --> 04:01:26,690
So it's like the elden ring paintings

1013
04:01:27,430 --> 04:01:28,309
cool

1014
04:01:28,309 --> 04:01:29,350
Okay

1015
04:01:29,350 --> 04:01:38,229
Have I been to one of them be properly equipped?

1016
04:01:40,840 --> 04:01:53,889
I won't fail. That was the tenth reference

1017
04:01:54,530 --> 04:01:59,409
That was an elden ring reference. That was not dark souls reference

1018
04:02:02,440 --> 04:02:07,040
kid

1019
04:02:07,040 --> 04:02:24,120
What do you got? It's the same thing

1020
04:02:30,930 --> 04:02:32,930
Okay, so you found the fairy fountain

1021
04:02:34,229 --> 04:02:43,250
Oh, wait, I know what that is

1022
04:02:51,090 --> 04:02:52,530
Oh, let's go. Let's do it

1023
04:02:52,530 --> 04:03:15,329
Should I just fuck up the quest because of them new clothes cute outfits

1024
04:03:16,290 --> 04:03:17,909
cute outfits

1025
04:03:17,909 --> 04:03:19,350
Oh

1026
04:03:19,350 --> 04:03:28,690
You have a sheikah slate on your hip

1027
04:03:30,659 --> 04:03:33,350
Wait a sheikah slate

1028
04:03:33,510 --> 04:03:38,229
Isn't that like an incredible thing that only incredible people can have?

1029
04:03:38,870 --> 04:03:49,170
Hold on. Just looking for a cute outfit

1030
04:03:49,489 --> 04:04:00,239
I don't want it. I have climbing gear

1031
04:04:04,229 --> 04:04:15,879
Oh shit, i'm losing them

1032
04:04:15,879 --> 04:04:23,860
Mask is op. Oh, maybe i'll get it later. I'm not going anywhere

1033
04:04:33,510 --> 04:04:48,420
Grain juice is pretty good. Yeah, I know where it is

1034
04:04:51,000 --> 04:05:01,040
Okay. Yeah, I know where it is. It's where the uh, the big lady is right?

1035
04:05:01,600 --> 04:05:28,440
That's a good pick too. Isn't there something she can do?

1036
04:05:33,729 --> 04:05:35,729
Enhance your clothing

1037
04:05:35,729 --> 04:05:36,690
Wow

1038
04:05:36,690 --> 04:05:46,979
Take a look. Wait a minute climb climbers bandana

1039
04:05:47,760 --> 04:05:50,000
And some rush rooms make this better

1040
04:05:54,120 --> 04:05:56,120
Choo-choo jelly soldiers armor

1041
04:05:56,520 --> 04:05:57,799
Okay

1042
04:05:57,799 --> 04:06:00,040
All right. I need rush rooms and I can upgrade my climbing gear

1043
04:06:05,270 --> 04:06:07,590
Cool. I need a picture of a rush room. Do I have rush rooms?

1044
04:06:09,280 --> 04:06:16,129
I think I have a picture. Well, not a picture. I think I have one in my inventory

1045
04:06:17,569 --> 04:06:21,329
Don't I?

1046
04:06:21,329 --> 04:06:28,899
Do I have a single rush room? I don't think so

1047
04:06:37,829 --> 04:06:40,229
Where do you get rush rooms?

1048
04:06:40,229 --> 04:06:43,590
I cooked them all. Yeah, but they're on the sides of cliffs, aren't they?

1049
04:06:44,389 --> 04:06:46,760
Usually they stick it out of a cliff

1050
04:06:46,760 --> 04:06:48,440
We can find one right here

1051
04:06:48,440 --> 04:06:58,389
It's the purple ones on the clips. I'll check that after this guy

1052
04:06:59,350 --> 04:07:06,639
Maybe this guy will give me some uh rush room

1053
04:07:07,120 --> 04:07:18,049
Here's the picture

1054
04:07:18,049 --> 04:07:21,489
That's it. It's beautiful, but I thought it would be more sacred and elegant

1055
04:07:23,639 --> 04:07:36,100
How is that not elegant and sacred? Is there a place you've been seeking?

1056
04:07:40,899 --> 04:07:48,530
Oh, I know where that is. All right big mountain east of this way. I know that place

1057
04:07:48,610 --> 04:07:52,049
There's a big mountain east of this village. It's called mount

1058
04:07:52,909 --> 04:07:59,670
Leneiru at the base of mount leneiru on the west side of najra snowfield lies that gate

1059
04:08:01,360 --> 04:08:19,889
base of mount leneiru west side of najra we're gonna mark it west of the

1060
04:08:21,329 --> 04:08:23,270
najra snowfield

1061
04:08:23,270 --> 04:08:31,809
so like here i'm gonna put a pin here and it's gonna be a

1062
04:08:32,370 --> 04:08:45,479
Um, go check this shit up. It's up from there. I'll figure it out. All right, I need to find

1063
04:08:46,440 --> 04:08:48,440
Some rush rooms. Let's check the clips

1064
04:08:49,239 --> 04:08:57,680
Because if i'm right here, I might as well try to upgrade this

1065
04:09:05,399 --> 04:09:10,280
No rush rooms

1066
04:09:10,280 --> 04:09:11,639
I don't see any

1067
04:09:11,639 --> 04:09:20,559
Oops, I distinctly remember there was a ton

1068
04:09:21,360 --> 04:09:25,360
Somewhere else. I remember just passing by them and not picking them up. I was like, nah, I don't need them

1069
04:09:25,920 --> 04:09:34,530
Put them on your sensor. I don't have a picture of them. Oh i'm doing that

1070
04:09:35,729 --> 04:09:47,719
Look at this

1071
04:09:47,719 --> 04:09:49,719
It's a great find. Look at all that money

1072
04:09:54,899 --> 04:09:58,239
Cool. All right

1073
04:09:58,239 --> 04:10:03,329
Here we go

1074
04:10:03,329 --> 04:10:05,329
Trine trine

1075
04:10:05,409 --> 04:10:07,409
And then i'm gonna open that thingy

1076
04:10:08,399 --> 04:10:16,790
What's wrong?

1077
04:10:16,790 --> 04:10:18,149
Hold on

1078
04:10:18,149 --> 04:10:26,530
There's a little thing here wooden bow rusty claymore

1079
04:10:29,559 --> 04:10:33,270
Sucks super fairy

1080
04:10:36,049 --> 04:10:37,489
Oh, okay

1081
04:10:37,489 --> 04:10:52,209
Soldier's broadsword. I feel like I have some crap to get rid of

1082
04:10:53,159 --> 04:11:05,959
Yeah, I do

1083
04:11:05,959 --> 04:11:07,399
This thing was better

1084
04:11:07,399 --> 04:11:21,040
Tortures are easy to find. Yeah, they are but I feel like I need one and I don't have one sometimes

1085
04:11:21,760 --> 04:11:37,280
back there

1086
04:11:37,280 --> 04:11:42,950
Okay, is this swamp or can I stand in this?

1087
04:11:43,670 --> 04:11:56,950
Where am I even going? All right. So I do want to go this way. This is kind of the direction I want to be going

1088
04:12:28,309 --> 04:12:35,719
All right trying time. I love the shrines. There's so much fun

1089
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:52,639
shrine time

1090
04:12:52,639 --> 04:12:54,319
shrine time

1091
04:12:54,319 --> 04:13:00,959
Why do we do that? Has anybody figured that out? Is there a reason why?

1092
04:13:01,440 --> 04:13:07,280
Anytime you stretch or if you're lying in bed or if you're just you have to make this horrible noise

1093
04:13:08,629 --> 04:13:09,670
why

1094
04:13:09,670 --> 04:13:20,280
When I get up in the morning, it doesn't happen every time either. It's just like I don't I don't know why

1095
04:13:22,149 --> 04:13:25,590
It's never been explained

1096
04:13:25,590 --> 04:13:28,549
And you freeze your whole body locks up

1097
04:13:29,510 --> 04:13:32,520
Why do we lock up and scream?

1098
04:13:32,840 --> 04:13:34,840
I'm not the only person that does this right?

1099
04:13:38,639 --> 04:13:41,600
Yeah, when you guys get up in the morning, do you lock up and scream?

1100
04:13:50,149 --> 04:14:56,079
Yes. Yeah, everybody does right that's emote only you can't tell me shit. All right, so that's obviously not what you do climb

1101
04:15:40,209 --> 04:15:52,760
World's most simple task. Okay, cool. Great. Now what?

1102
04:15:54,549 --> 04:17:10,020
Um, all right, so i've got stasis. Okay, check this out. I think I know what to do. What's that?

1103
04:18:51,459 --> 04:19:03,809
That it you have to do it. It's two more times. Oh fuck dude. I got the bowl already

1104
04:19:35,250 --> 04:19:36,389
um

1105
04:19:36,389 --> 04:20:03,909
wait

1106
04:20:03,909 --> 04:20:06,229
Okay, so I gotta put the button down hold on

1107
04:20:53,760 --> 04:20:56,879
That's what you do. You just gotta scoop it up like a reverse claw machine. I know what i'm doing

1108
04:21:18,209 --> 04:21:42,799
Let me know that's what that's exactly what you're supposed to do. I'm just too slow watch this ready

1109
04:21:45,030 --> 04:21:51,159
I didn't I wanted to i'll get it right here

1110
04:22:05,909 --> 04:22:09,909
That's definitely what you do. That's definitely it's just the stupid thing

1111
04:22:10,549 --> 04:22:21,829
I need to get this in the right spot. Come on. Check this out. I got it ready

1112
04:22:27,440 --> 04:22:29,440
So if I come straight up from here

1113
04:22:29,760 --> 04:23:21,649
I want to get the ball

1114
04:23:21,649 --> 04:23:25,250
No, I had it. I I just did it. I just did it. I just did it

1115
04:23:25,250 --> 04:23:34,930
But this thing was too fucking wiggly. I just did it. I just did it guys. I just did it

1116
04:23:35,010 --> 04:23:57,840
I'm doing it that way. I don't I just did it I fucking win

1117
04:24:17,239 --> 04:24:39,239
That's it. I got it. I win. Did you lose your points? I did it. You could have just left a ball on top

1118
04:24:46,280 --> 04:24:53,239
Right. Thank god, that's over

1119
04:24:59,520 --> 04:25:22,079
Let's make me sneeze that wasn't even that bad. It wasn't even that bad. There's another one right over here

1120
04:25:32,200 --> 04:25:39,719
I do have four orbs. I think I need to do health. I'm getting one hit killed way too often way too often

1121
04:25:40,040 --> 04:26:08,440
What the heck is that thing? Oh my god, it burped. Where was that other? Uh shrine there it is

1122
04:26:14,690 --> 04:26:16,719
Get out of there

1123
04:26:16,719 --> 04:26:19,729
I'm doing the shrine. Here's my plan

1124
04:26:20,049 --> 04:26:25,879
I'm doing the shrine here and then i'm gonna wrap around here to do the divine beast. That's my plan

1125
04:26:26,360 --> 04:26:29,040
How do you what do you turn in the spirit orbs again? I forget

1126
04:26:30,239 --> 04:26:40,149
Who does that?

1127
04:26:40,149 --> 04:26:43,409
Make sure you get this tower too. Yeah, i'm gonna get that tower

1128
04:26:45,110 --> 04:26:48,120
and

1129
04:26:48,120 --> 04:26:50,120
All right the route i'm gonna go

1130
04:26:50,840 --> 04:26:53,799
Straight that way get the tower get the shrine

1131
04:26:55,159 --> 04:26:57,159
And then i'm gonna bang a right

1132
04:26:57,639 --> 04:26:58,840
that way

1133
04:26:58,840 --> 04:27:00,870
Get this tower

1134
04:27:00,870 --> 04:27:14,559
And get that tower. How do I take out the binoculars to mark again?

1135
04:27:15,280 --> 04:27:17,510
I can do with the camera, right?

1136
04:27:17,510 --> 04:27:24,659
How do I do this? It's l3

1137
04:27:28,680 --> 04:27:44,200
Right stick. Okay. Yeah, thank you

1138
04:27:44,200 --> 04:27:47,360
Okay. All right

1139
04:27:47,360 --> 04:28:01,059
Cool. Let's go the statue and uh kakariko. Okay

1140
04:28:09,360 --> 04:28:11,440
How long are you gonna be live for? Um

1141
04:28:12,319 --> 04:28:15,329
I don't know. I'm gonna have a set plan

1142
04:28:15,969 --> 04:28:17,409
an hour or two

1143
04:28:17,409 --> 04:28:32,040
Where's your horse? I know I just don't have one. Did I just call a bunch of bulls?

1144
04:28:32,600 --> 04:28:35,860
What did the horse call do that?

1145
04:28:37,729 --> 04:28:40,079
Why did I just call that?

1146
04:28:40,079 --> 04:28:41,760
Why are they all freaking out?

1147
04:28:41,760 --> 04:28:51,059
That was a word smoke here. What's this?

1148
04:28:51,620 --> 04:29:19,569
It's a new ingredient

1149
04:29:20,049 --> 04:29:22,049
I'm so dumb

1150
04:29:36,799 --> 04:29:39,100
Oh, what's this?

1151
04:29:39,100 --> 04:29:42,750
Arm-o-ran

1152
04:30:00,950 --> 04:30:22,930
There yeah, is there a chest here usually there is right? Oh nice arrows

1153
04:30:27,879 --> 04:30:35,559
Kind of running out of weapons

1154
04:30:40,360 --> 04:31:06,100
Oh the cleave that was perfect. Okay, that was challenging

1155
04:31:06,739 --> 04:31:13,110
Something good night's halberd. I'll take it

1156
04:31:13,750 --> 04:31:19,120
spiked boko spear

1157
04:31:19,280 --> 04:31:21,590
and

1158
04:31:26,600 --> 04:31:29,280
Onto the shrine

1159
04:31:34,479 --> 04:31:41,799
Zapturum make sure to take a picture of the weapons

1160
04:31:45,159 --> 04:31:47,000
Take photos

1161
04:31:47,000 --> 04:31:52,600
Oh you there

1162
04:31:52,600 --> 04:32:04,899
Over here over here. Oh, I just been calling on you. So suddenly

1163
04:32:05,840 --> 04:32:08,639
I am lido a proud member of the distinguished zora

1164
04:32:09,719 --> 04:32:13,159
Are you a real hylian? I had no choice but to call upon you

1165
04:32:13,719 --> 04:32:15,719
Will you spare me a moment of your time?

1166
04:32:16,479 --> 04:32:17,840
Sure

1167
04:32:17,840 --> 04:32:29,159
See that tower the one atop that mountain. Yeah, I need you to go upstream of zora river

1168
04:32:29,719 --> 04:32:33,079
Which runs along the north side of that tower to inogo bridge

1169
04:32:36,959 --> 04:32:38,959
I can see it in your eyes. You're asking yourself why

1170
04:32:40,200 --> 04:32:44,040
Reasonable question for a stranger frosted by a passing zora in such a manner

1171
04:32:44,600 --> 04:32:47,879
But I must assure you this venture will be profitable for you as well

1172
04:32:48,680 --> 04:32:53,000
See prince cedan of zora is in desperate search of a strong hylian

1173
04:32:53,559 --> 04:32:58,040
And as a loyal request from the prince himself, it's safe to assume a generous reward is in the cards

1174
04:32:59,780 --> 04:33:04,880
I'm asking you go meet prince cedan at inogo bridge along the zora river just upstream from here

1175
04:33:09,270 --> 04:33:12,020
You're getting robbed

1176
04:33:12,020 --> 04:33:12,900
Okay

1177
04:33:12,900 --> 04:33:14,020
That's fine

1178
04:33:14,020 --> 04:33:19,810
That's not wait. Do I I can I don't have to accept it?

1179
04:33:23,889 --> 04:33:26,130
Or just know that it's there

1180
04:33:26,270 --> 04:33:50,659
zidon

1181
04:33:50,659 --> 04:34:17,119
Uh, not good green nut. Um, do I have to land in here or maybe what do I have to burn it or something?

1182
04:34:17,680 --> 04:34:22,500
Fire right? Yeah, I remember seeing that spoiler from last time. I was live

1183
04:34:38,240 --> 04:34:40,240
That sucks, i'm sorry, man

1184
04:34:46,159 --> 04:34:49,220
Okay, so I need fire

1185
04:34:49,860 --> 04:34:52,259
This fire over there

1186
04:34:52,259 --> 04:34:54,259
Question is can I bring it this way?

1187
04:34:54,979 --> 04:35:02,099
Is this like a giant torch?

1188
04:35:02,099 --> 04:35:04,099
This thing right here

1189
04:35:04,099 --> 04:35:07,880
Oh, I have flint

1190
04:35:08,360 --> 04:35:45,509
Dude, I can stand in this why do you drown in that I can stand up. Hello

1191
04:35:45,990 --> 04:35:55,560
This doesn't work

1192
04:35:55,560 --> 04:36:23,830
What about my arrow? Wait, hold on. Yeah, that doesn't start a fire. Hold on. I'll be right back

1193
04:36:24,389 --> 04:37:18,799
Does this work? You need wood and flint. What the fuck?

1194
04:37:20,369 --> 04:37:52,759
Wood and flint. I almost got no more left. Okay, bro. Your dark uga is showing

1195
04:37:54,209 --> 04:38:29,380
Dark uga this is a bug in my hair. Oh boy. They're done. Are they done?

1196
04:38:30,369 --> 04:39:00,419
They can burn or whatever. This is worse than a regular apple regular apple is better. No, it's not it's not

1197
04:39:00,580 --> 04:39:11,330
I thought it was one heart. No, that's not what I said. I I mean I like regular apples in real life

1198
04:39:11,409 --> 04:39:28,240
I don't like baked apples. I like old apples. You guys misunderstood me. I want more weapons and armor and stuff

1199
04:39:33,799 --> 04:41:06,279
Let's trial speed of light. I got it. Okay now it's only the second. Mm-hmm. Right now that shit floods

1200
04:41:44,360 --> 04:41:48,069
It seems I don't know where to go

1201
04:41:50,819 --> 04:41:55,110
This elevator goes up but this barrel

1202
04:41:56,229 --> 04:41:58,520
Goes down

1203
04:41:58,520 --> 04:42:02,799
Hmm. All right. Um

1204
04:42:02,959 --> 04:42:32,000
It's definitely something out here. What if I block this and do anything?

1205
04:42:32,560 --> 04:43:30,930
What's the point of this?

1206
04:43:33,159 --> 04:44:03,330
Oh, thank god ice cold. Do I have to like fill the barrel with water so it makes sense, right? Make it heavier

1207
04:44:03,889 --> 04:44:29,540
It's not what you do. I probably have to spin this thing back but

1208
04:44:30,180 --> 04:44:32,930
Can I?

1209
04:44:32,930 --> 04:44:47,669
Interesting. Why would I want to do that though?

1210
04:44:50,720 --> 04:45:09,250
Why would I want to stop that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know but let me go over here. Okay, if I go like this

1211
04:45:34,919 --> 04:45:36,919
Oh the water

1212
04:45:38,930 --> 04:46:05,700
Water. Uh-huh. But so I put the water fill the tank with water

1213
04:46:11,860 --> 04:46:22,159
Fill the thing with water. Okay now

1214
04:46:22,159 --> 04:46:36,159
Now

1215
04:46:45,680 --> 04:46:58,450
Okay, so I have to get this plan is to get this back over there

1216
04:46:59,639 --> 04:47:01,639
And then get over there myself

1217
04:47:02,279 --> 04:47:04,279
Freeze time on that thing

1218
04:47:05,080 --> 04:47:07,779
All right. I know what to do

1219
04:47:07,779 --> 04:47:09,779
This could be wrong, but whatever let's try it

1220
04:47:14,580 --> 04:47:18,450
Get this back over there. Okay now

1221
04:47:19,330 --> 04:47:24,119
I'm gonna do this

1222
04:47:24,599 --> 04:47:29,459
What if I do that maybe that's stupid this could be stupid but we'll find out

1223
04:47:30,419 --> 04:47:39,779
I can't freeze time on this. So, all right, I'm gonna freeze time on you

1224
04:47:41,040 --> 04:47:42,689
Spin it

1225
04:47:42,689 --> 04:47:54,759
Go

1226
04:47:54,759 --> 04:48:35,590
All right. Got it. Wasn't that bad. Is this for a spirit orb? Very cool spirit orb

1227
04:48:39,880 --> 04:48:41,080
Five. Yep

1228
04:48:41,080 --> 04:48:43,080
Cool. All right. Now I'm gonna activate the tower

1229
04:48:44,919 --> 04:49:03,090
And oh I have the seeds too, don't I? I got four of those. The time freeze didn't do anything

1230
04:49:03,409 --> 04:49:06,869
You didn't even notice the extra chest

1231
04:49:10,150 --> 04:49:11,750
Yeah, whatever

1232
04:49:11,750 --> 04:49:34,040
There's some unobtanium over here though link. You are an awful swimmer. Give me a break really i'm gonna drown in here

1233
04:49:37,919 --> 04:49:58,709
No, i'm not. Where is it? What a waste. That's such a waste

1234
04:50:00,470 --> 04:50:02,470
Nah, i'll just die. Whatever just die

1235
04:50:03,110 --> 04:50:04,799
Go ahead and die

1236
04:50:04,799 --> 04:50:37,479
Yep, I can't make that i'm gonna jump. I'm just gonna jump from off the shrine

1237
04:50:38,709 --> 04:50:49,619
Go from up here. All right ice functions. You're right. I forgot I had ice

1238
04:50:49,939 --> 04:50:55,540
I keep forgetting you can use this stuff outside of the shrines in my brain. It's a shrine power

1239
04:51:19,830 --> 04:51:21,830
Get the unobtanium and then head over here

1240
04:51:22,069 --> 04:51:33,639
Let's get the shit out of me

1241
04:51:49,860 --> 04:52:07,680
Cool, let's go sledgehammer is damaged. Where do you get? I have not found another sledgehammer. All right, it's broken

1242
04:52:07,680 --> 04:52:09,680
But how do you get another sledgehammer?

1243
04:52:15,650 --> 04:52:16,529
Oh

1244
04:52:16,529 --> 04:52:32,180

Through to this mission here. That's what i'm going after. Why is it getting so dark?

1246
04:52:47,409 --> 04:53:07,779
Step right up and buy them. I find bananas. They're available. They're so yellow they make you yell. Oh, okay

1248
04:53:22,659 --> 04:53:35,639
That'll take your life what you just love when the fucking lock-on turns around and looks at the shrine behind you

1249
04:53:59,490 --> 04:54:02,709
Got something to say

1250
04:54:02,709 --> 04:54:04,630

1256
04:54:56,849 --> 04:54:58,369
I don't think it was more than one

1257
04:55:06,500 --> 04:55:11,700
All right vantage point interesting camp that I don't want to go into

1258

1267
04:58:26,840 --> 04:58:31,639
Okay, I didn't know that you could get that hurt doing that. I guess that was pretty brutal

1268
04:58:34,279 --> 04:58:36,279
I thought I was safe. I guess

1269
04:58:36,360 --> 04:58:38,919

Combat trial. Oh

All right. I'm taking some food here. This is defense. This is attack boost. I'm going with this

05:01:14,099 --> 05:01:46,069
What did I miss?

1297
05:01:46,069 --> 05:01:48,819
Why did it miss? It shouldn't have missed

1298
05:01:48,819 --> 05:01:51,830

You dick you dick. Who is it?

1355
05:11:23,599 --> 05:11:33,909
What the hell is that?

1356
05:11:34,150 --> 05:11:36,150
Whoa, what did I just do?

1357
05:11:36,720 --> 05:11:39,520
These are explosive arrows. Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1358
05:12:01,750 --> 05:12:12,560
What was that thing?

1359
05:12:12,560 --> 05:12:16,119
Ice rod waves of freezing air

1360
05:12:16,759 --> 05:12:23,889
Does it break?

1361
05:12:23,889 --> 05:12:26,709
I don't want to put that on

1362
05:12:26,950 --> 05:12:38,069
Holy shit. Okay. This is awesome. Very cool. All right

1363
05:12:38,869 --> 05:12:44,950
Most of the tower

1364
05:12:44,950 --> 05:12:50,659
Chest or anything. Can I break these with the club or does it have to be a hammer?

1365
05:12:56,479 --> 05:13:14,450
Damn it bombs will do it in bobs do it too. Cool

1366
05:13:16,419 --> 05:13:22,450
Uh, some lucky person is gonna like find that and get rich and that's fine. I don't care

1367
05:13:23,330 --> 05:13:40,020
interesting

1368
05:13:43,599 --> 05:14:16,209
Press for a moment. Have I given a rating? It's uh,

1369
05:14:21,380 --> 05:14:28,150
Um, I don't know it's definitely a

1370
05:14:29,939 --> 05:14:34,000
it's way higher than an eight because i'm

1371
05:14:34,720 --> 05:14:37,119
Realizing the amount of things you can actually do

1372
05:14:38,799 --> 05:14:41,970
It's very comfy

1373
05:14:41,970 --> 05:14:43,009
Okay

1374
05:14:43,009 --> 05:14:45,009
I know people are gonna be mad that i'm gonna say this

1375
05:14:45,810 --> 05:14:46,610
but

1376
05:14:46,610 --> 05:14:49,009
All right, whatever i'm gonna say

1377
05:14:49,009 --> 05:14:55,400
This is a comfy elden ring. It's not I didn't say easier

1378
05:14:56,119 --> 05:14:59,430
It's not oh, this is like a kid's game. No, no, no

1379
05:14:59,509 --> 05:15:01,830
It's just a comp. It's just a comfier elden ring

1380
05:15:05,540 --> 05:15:11,139
I don't I mean, yeah, maybe i've been a little stressed during some of the encounters but for the most part i'm not

1381
05:15:11,779 --> 05:15:13,540
um

1382
05:15:13,540 --> 05:15:16,180
I'm not stressed the fuck out like I am everywhere in elden ring

1383
05:15:22,869 --> 05:15:26,229
When I die in this I just kind of laugh it off and I just climb the mountain again

1384
05:15:26,630 --> 05:15:33,040
You don't really get penalized for losing like you do in the prom software games, obviously

1385
05:15:42,610 --> 05:15:45,169
Like i'll ski off the mountain and fall down and die

1386
05:15:45,650 --> 05:15:49,880
Because it doesn't matter i'm not gonna lose 50 000 souls or something

1387
05:15:50,599 --> 05:15:53,560
Or forget how I I not even get back to that area again

1388
05:15:58,849 --> 05:16:01,169
Elden ring for non-clout chasers

1389
05:16:03,889 --> 05:16:06,290
No, what do you think clout chasers?

1390
05:16:08,919 --> 05:16:11,319
Why is the elden ring for clout chasers?

1391
05:16:32,290 --> 05:16:33,810
I can't believe it

1392
05:16:33,810 --> 05:16:37,250
Excuse me. Have you talked to uh syden yet? He's down there

1393

They are shoving this down my throat right now. They're just like push. It's like they're just like hey

There's a guy syden there. He is

1398
05:17:03,139 --> 05:17:07,060
Go to syden go he's up there. Oh, by the way, i'm gonna go find him

1399
05:17:14,770 --> 05:17:17,330
So I mean what what?

1400
05:17:17,889 --> 05:17:23,169
I said they're pushing it down. They're jumping it in my throat. That's saying

1401
05:17:26,290 --> 05:17:37,880
That's a saying

1402
05:17:44,770 --> 05:17:46,689
Okay, I just typed it

1403
05:17:46,689 --> 05:17:48,529
Don't google that

1404
05:17:48,529 --> 05:17:50,290
Don't google that

1405
05:17:50,290 --> 05:17:52,290
You could find yourself in a little bit of trouble

1406
05:17:53,090 --> 05:17:55,090
I I just oh that oh god

1407
05:17:59,909 --> 05:18:02,229

05:18:07,759 --> 05:18:20,479
Oh my god

1410
05:18:20,479 --> 05:18:29,700
The legend of zelda prince syden. What did I google? I just never mind it. Just forget it

1411
05:18:30,520 --> 05:18:32,919
Forget everything. Don't forget everything

1412
05:18:40,200 --> 05:18:41,400
Oh

1413
05:18:41,400 --> 05:18:44,439
Push this guy off you can't there's no there's no collision

1414
05:18:52,479 --> 05:18:55,759
I'm having a little bit of trouble. Is that it's prince syden down here

1415
05:19:14,790 --> 05:19:23,200
Found him say hey there young one up top above you

1416
05:19:23,680 --> 05:19:34,549
What's up syden?

1417
05:19:34,549 --> 05:19:38,790
He's googling pardon the entrance. I I don't have to tell you what I typed in

1418
05:19:39,029 --> 05:19:43,270
I was hoping perhaps you'd have a moment to talk people question marked by use of that phrase

1419
05:19:44,500 --> 05:19:46,819
And I was like, what are you talking about? So I typed it in

1420
05:19:49,720 --> 05:19:51,880
And I just I was like, okay, wait

1421
05:20:07,319 --> 05:20:09,959
What why is it what everybody wanted me to come see syden?

1422
05:20:15,060 --> 05:20:17,060
I am syden the zora prince

1423
05:20:18,240 --> 05:20:24,470
What is your name?

1424
05:20:24,470 --> 05:20:26,470
People really like syden

1425
05:20:26,950 --> 05:20:27,909
Okay

1426
05:20:27,909 --> 05:20:42,259
Have we ever met this person?

1427
05:20:42,259 --> 05:20:43,779
I mean in the other

1428
05:20:43,779 --> 05:20:45,220
Uh zelda games

1429
05:20:45,220 --> 05:20:48,840
Is prince syden a character that's in the other games?

1430
05:20:49,400 --> 05:20:58,930
That's me

1431
05:20:58,930 --> 05:21:07,880
I am a zora prince after all I have an eye for talent that is unparalleled

1432
05:21:08,840 --> 05:21:10,459
Yes exquisite

1433
05:21:10,459 --> 05:21:16,810
I've been searching for someone like you for a long while a man like you link who carries himself with power

1434
05:21:17,900 --> 05:21:24,220
Right now zora's domain is in grave danger because of the massive rainfall coming from divine beast varuta. Okay, that explains it

1435
05:21:24,939 --> 05:21:31,400
Please promise you will help us. We need your strength warrior. Won't you please come to zora's domain?

1436
05:21:32,119 --> 05:21:46,860
Sure now zora's domain will be saved for certain no time to waste. Hurry up and head over

1437
05:21:48,220 --> 05:21:53,130
Because of the rain the cliffs are too wet to climb I figured that out earlier

1438
05:21:54,060 --> 05:21:56,459
To reach the domain you will need to go straight along this path

1439
05:21:59,430 --> 05:22:01,590
As a hylian, I know you are unable to swim up

1440
05:22:04,360 --> 05:22:06,520
As such the path to the domain may be difficult

1441
05:22:07,479 --> 05:22:11,319
You likely have a tough fight in store. There are monsters up ahead that attack with electricity

1442
05:22:15,939 --> 05:22:20,150
Don't give up. I believe in you

1443
05:22:20,150 --> 05:22:22,150
Oh, that's right. I have something that I'd like to give you

1444
05:22:22,549 --> 05:22:26,520
small trinket

1445
05:22:26,520 --> 05:22:28,520
electro elixir

1446
05:22:29,099 --> 05:22:32,119
Cool grants of mid-level resistance to electricity

1447
05:22:32,759 --> 05:23:02,169
Everybody loves this person. Everybody loves it

1448
05:23:03,130 --> 05:23:05,979
Sidon, but who's my favorite character?

1449
05:23:25,990 --> 05:23:31,180
I need to know who my favorite character. All right, so we're gonna go to we're gonna do this, but not yet

1450
05:23:31,259 --> 05:23:40,139
What did I just what the hell is this hero's path mode? Wait, is this showing?

1451
05:23:40,860 --> 05:23:48,659
Is this showing where I've been like these frivolous? What?

1452
05:23:49,540 --> 05:23:51,540
What what happened here?

1453
05:23:52,979 --> 05:24:08,580
What happened here? I don't know what I did over here press a

1454
05:24:15,270 --> 05:24:21,560
What killed me? Uh-huh

1455
05:24:34,069 --> 05:24:36,069
Wasn't that the first area?

1456
05:24:40,709 --> 05:24:42,709
I teleported to this

1457
05:24:46,020 --> 05:24:48,020
How many times did you guys die in this first like

1458
05:24:48,659 --> 05:25:02,200
Level one starter zone

1459
05:25:02,200 --> 05:25:14,419
What was going on here? This is not accurate. This is not accurate

1460
05:25:15,720 --> 05:25:19,419
What happened?

1461
05:25:19,419 --> 05:25:21,500
What did I do was I fucking drunk?

1462
05:25:22,139 --> 05:25:27,259
Was I high?

1463
05:25:27,259 --> 05:25:46,569
What happened? Oh, that's the stone guy, right? How do you die in kakariko village? It's impossible

1464
05:26:03,529 --> 05:26:07,299
God damn it, man. Oh my god

1465
05:26:50,779 --> 05:27:21,880
Okay, so I teleported back to there back to the same spot. Why did I teleport back here? What are you doing?

1466
05:27:38,250 --> 05:28:02,979
Here we are. Why did I teleport three times the same place? That's a cool. I like that feature a lot

1467
05:28:02,979 --> 05:28:11,689
That's so fun. Go fight that guy now. Oh my should I go get revenge? I'm getting revenge

1468
05:28:29,979 --> 05:28:51,240
I got bomb arrows. This guy is in deep shit. I don't have any hammers. Do I actually need a hammer?

1469
05:29:00,700 --> 05:29:03,770
All right, where is this dude?

1470
05:29:04,409 --> 05:29:26,979
Right here, right? Where is he brian brian?

1471
05:29:27,459 --> 05:30:13,349
Where is he who's over here? Right? If you beat the game in under 200 hours, we could watch the whole thing

1472
05:30:13,750 --> 05:30:16,490
Really?

1473
05:30:16,490 --> 05:30:55,180
Will I beat this game and lock this monster? What the hell is that thing? Oh my god. I have an idea

1474
05:30:55,419 --> 05:31:06,459
Why are these not exploding? It's a bomb arrow

1475
05:31:11,220 --> 05:31:13,459
What because it's raining?

1476
05:31:24,869 --> 05:31:51,020
I'm kind of more curious about the huge dragon eel serpent thing that was just flying around over here. Where'd it go?

1477
05:31:51,990 --> 05:31:53,110
Whoa

1478

05:48:01,049 --> 05:48:03,049
Put the metal away, dude

1516
05:48:06,810 --> 05:48:09,130
Metal in a lightning storm. That's really what it was

1517
05:48:13,290 --> 05:48:23,139
So what all the uh, uh, uh, I really am just a walking conductor, aren't I? I get it. I feel

1518
05:48:23,840 --> 05:48:31,830
Accomplished maybe not the smartest way the g4 rated the stream. Did I miss that?

1519
05:48:32,630 --> 05:48:38,180
You hear from g4? What's going on? I didn't even see it

1520
05:48:50,520 --> 05:49:04,310
Uh-uh

1521
05:49:04,310 --> 05:49:07,509
Um, but wait, don't I have the what did I get a topaz?

1522
05:49:08,150 --> 05:49:31,529
So I killed the boss

1523
05:49:31,529 --> 05:49:36,119
It took me like 10 straight minutes to do that and after the boss dies

1524
05:49:36,119 --> 05:49:40,599
I pick up all the items and then get struck by lightning because i'm

1525
05:49:41,319 --> 05:49:46,439
The tin man. I have a bunch of pots and pans on me and I die instantly and then it didn't save

1526
05:49:47,319 --> 05:49:50,970
I have to do it again

1527
05:49:50,970 --> 05:49:53,049
You got killed by an act of god

1528
05:49:58,819 --> 05:50:00,819
Dude, I have to do that again

1529
05:50:03,779 --> 05:50:06,040
um

1530
05:50:06,040 --> 05:50:07,720
Okay. Well

1532
05:50:13,740 --> 05:50:20,939
Chatter is upset about the vet. Do I have the topaz? I don't see it anywhere

1533
05:50:25,610 --> 05:50:29,639
No times one

1534
05:50:29,639 --> 05:50:32,759
No

1535
05:50:32,759 --> 05:50:35,799
Sapphire

1536
05:50:35,799 --> 05:50:42,040
No, it didn't save

1537
05:50:42,040 --> 05:50:53,529
Well shit. Okay. Well, I beat it and I know it's there but i'm gonna mark it like right here because i'll come back and do it again

1538
05:50:54,549 --> 05:51:09,880
I'll just come back and kill it at like level 50. Okay. Well now I need to change this stamp

1539
05:51:11,290 --> 05:51:12,549

Whatever it is called. This is gonna be fucking secrets up here gonna be secrets up here, right furrowed brow. That's right

1551
05:55:38,740 --> 05:56:18,520
All right. So what's up here? Interesting. Come on, dude. Really? I don't have a single arrow. You gotta be shitting me

1552
05:57:05,799 --> 05:57:13,049
And I still get the item I can probably get the torch too where to go that went way over

1553
05:57:19,340 --> 05:57:23,369
Ah

1554
05:57:23,369 --> 05:57:29,619

05:59:45,590 --> 06:00:11,299
Sidance already to the boomerang. I can't care. I uh, it's cool, but I don't think I want it. I'll try it

1560
06:00:11,459 --> 06:00:15,270
But

1561
06:00:15,270 --> 06:00:33,340
I'm just checking around the sides. You never know. It's two week rift. Are you playing slime rancher tomorrow? No

1562
06:00:34,250 --> 06:00:37,720
I'm doing birthday stuff tomorrow. I'll be back on saturday. We're gonna do

1563
06:00:39,159 --> 06:00:44,060
Uh slime rancher 2 on saturday and then probably back to breath of the wild on sunday

1564
06:00:44,299 --> 06:01:24,759
You gotta do a birthday stream. No, i'm not doing a birthday stream a lot of enemies here a lot of enemies here

1565
06:01:35,770 --> 06:01:50,150
Thank god long enough for me to find some. Okay, so take off unequip literally everything, right? How do I unequip everything?

1566
06:01:56,419 --> 06:02:03,740
I take off all I because uh the lightning shit i'm not holding anything. I'm just naked

1567
06:02:03,819 --> 06:02:08,619
I'm not gonna get struck by lightning, right?

1568
06:02:08,619 --> 06:02:10,619
I won't get struck by lightning if i'm naked

1569
06:02:13,450 --> 06:02:19,159
I hope that's accurate

1570
06:02:19,159 --> 06:02:33,299
Clothes are fine

1571
06:02:33,299 --> 06:02:40,060
And wooden weapons are fine. I don't think I have anything that's wood. There's the harpoon. I mean this is metal at the end

1572
06:02:40,139 --> 06:02:59,319
No, just climbing

1573
06:02:59,319 --> 06:03:02,709
These metal

1574
06:03:09,430 --> 06:04:01,959
Take them off take them off. Okay, we're good clothes do not matter ants are safe clothes don't matter

1575
06:04:02,919 --> 06:04:07,720
Well, um, I made it up here

1576
06:04:12,360 --> 06:04:25,939
Pants are safe. All right, here's the plan two more shrines. I'm gonna do the omega turn in level up twice

1577
06:04:26,500 --> 06:04:28,500
And then probably call it there

1578
06:04:28,900 --> 06:04:46,619
I got one shrine marked. Oh if it's sparking in the menu, it's unsafe. That's interesting. Okay

1579
06:04:47,099 --> 06:05:01,419
Good to know let's take a quick look

1580
06:05:01,500 --> 06:05:06,919
You can't say omega when it's not omega gaming weekend

1581
06:05:08,069 --> 06:05:09,189
That's true

1582
06:05:09,189 --> 06:05:13,669
No, you're right. Okay, that one's marked

1583
06:05:17,400 --> 06:05:20,119
Any others from here I could be able to see a lot. Um

1584
06:05:24,259 --> 06:05:26,659
Not that I can see from here. I think that's the only one

1585
06:05:27,380 --> 06:05:36,860
I think that actually is the only one

1586
06:05:40,650 --> 06:05:42,229
Yeah

1587
06:05:42,229 --> 06:05:44,229
Really? Damn. What about here?

1588
06:05:49,419 --> 06:05:51,139
Is that

1589
06:05:51,139 --> 06:05:53,139
Rubble or something or is that a monster?

1590
06:05:53,779 --> 06:05:59,909
I'm marking it whatever it is

1591
06:05:59,909 --> 06:06:01,909
All right. Well, let's go

1592
06:06:05,529 --> 06:06:09,049
I can't get struck by lightning in the air, but i'm just ready to get struck

1593
06:06:09,689 --> 06:06:23,500
Look at the menu. Oh

1594
06:06:23,900 --> 06:06:28,779
Okay

1595
06:06:28,779 --> 06:06:31,779
So these are safe

1596
06:06:32,439 --> 06:06:40,630
Cool, they do a little twinkle

1597
06:06:51,700 --> 06:07:22,979
I'm too lazy to go pick that up pretty good snapshot. Oh you ducked. Did you just go like this?

1598
06:07:23,380 --> 06:07:49,610
You just put his arms in like I don't know

1599
06:07:57,259 --> 06:08:04,790
Go I need to heal I have tons of food. I really haven't been taking that much damage

1600
06:08:04,790 --> 06:08:23,880
I die instantly. I don't take damage and die. You're talking about that one, right?

1601
06:08:26,659 --> 06:08:28,659

An encampment or something. What is this?

1604
06:08:34,169 --> 06:08:40,340
Where's my bow?

1605
06:08:40,340 --> 06:08:43,099
Oh, I unequipped it because I freaked out, right?

1606
06:08:51,340 --> 06:08:53,220

1642
06:20:39,270 --> 06:20:44,759

I don't know sometimes there's a little uh, the little forest creatures. All right

1677
06:27:43,049 --> 06:27:45,770
This is the last shrine we're doing tonight, then i'm gonna go level up twice

1678
06:27:52,060 --> 06:28:00,869
And then uh, i'm gonna like half hour. You need to have you need ancient horse here. That's cool

1679
06:28:16,900 --> 06:28:18,900
Combat trial or a puzzle trial

1680
06:28:20,680 --> 06:28:30,970
I know this is a combat trial. I got plenty of good weapons. This should be I should be able to do this pretty easily

1681
06:28:32,659 --> 06:28:38,950
Minor test of strength. Okay, i'll be fine. At least I hope so

1682
06:28:41,049 --> 06:28:57,619
I shouldn't use a fishing harpoon though. Use this thing

1683
06:29:00,709 --> 06:29:37,259
Why won't you dodge sideways dodge sideways finally what the heck is happening

1684
06:30:25,240 --> 06:30:26,279
Uh-oh

1685
06:30:26,279 --> 06:30:34,150
You do this thing out of here guardian sword and another guardian shield

1686
06:30:39,990 --> 06:31:00,619
Yep, can't carry any more shields. Yes, I can. It's the same thing. I'll get rid of this one then

1687
06:31:01,580 --> 06:31:13,720
Uh

1688
06:31:13,720 --> 06:31:22,819
Yep. Yeah, wait 16 and eight. Uh, whatever keep the wood one. I thought this one was 18. Okay 16

1689
06:31:24,869 --> 06:31:28,569
All right

1690
06:31:28,569 --> 06:31:29,990
so all the

1691
06:31:29,990 --> 06:31:31,849
guardian shield plus

1692
06:31:31,849 --> 06:31:38,380
Okay, cool. Where's your nintendo shirt? I had it on for like four hours

1693
06:31:38,700 --> 06:31:50,520
It was just getting really sweaty and hot so I just take it off boomerang. I don't want that

1694
06:31:51,000 --> 06:31:55,669
Oh better than the this

1695
06:32:06,569 --> 06:32:10,729
Cool, okay. Now I need to go back to the village

1696
06:32:12,790 --> 06:32:15,110
And i'm gonna level up stamina twice

1697
06:32:18,229 --> 06:32:30,630
Is that bad? Or should I do health twice? I feel like I need the hearts. I'm gonna do uh hearts twice

1698
06:32:32,970 --> 06:32:34,020
Yeah

1699
06:32:34,020 --> 06:32:44,810
Only a four

1700
06:32:44,810 --> 06:32:47,610
Yeah, I gotta stop. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a four health Andy. I know it's bad

1701
06:32:47,930 --> 06:32:52,759
Maybe I won't get one hit killed by the regular enemies anymore if I had six hearts

1702
06:32:56,169 --> 06:33:08,729
We scream

1703
06:33:08,729 --> 06:33:11,099
So i'm good

1704
06:33:11,099 --> 06:33:21,819
I'm gonna go back to uh, where's that? Where do I need to go here? Where's that thing?

1705
06:33:23,700 --> 06:33:31,270
Shrine island

1706
06:33:31,270 --> 06:33:42,729
All towns have a statue. Okay. Well, i'll just go back to next to impa two hearts

1707
06:33:51,799 --> 06:33:54,279
Oh, i'm gonna bet that yeah the seed guy too. I'll do that as well

1708
06:33:55,720 --> 06:33:57,720
Just cleaning up some loose ends

1709
06:33:58,200 --> 06:34:10,939
All right, so saying right

1710
06:34:11,020 --> 06:34:13,259
next to impa's house

1711
06:34:13,849 --> 06:34:59,349
Which is here right on a heart container i'm doing too very good do it again

1712
06:35:12,650 --> 06:35:20,790
All right. That's feels pretty good. Now. I want to go back to

1713
06:35:21,270 --> 06:35:47,779
I marked you on the map right here, right? Okay. I'll just walk here. He's not there anymore upgrade your armor

1714
06:35:51,830 --> 06:35:53,349
Oh, that's right

1715
06:35:53,349 --> 06:36:03,819
That's right. That's right. That's right. All right, we're gonna go there first still there

1716
06:36:08,069 --> 06:37:07,509
So i'm gonna upgrade my chest piece first. He still might be there. Okay, welcome back enhance away. Let's go

1717
06:37:07,590 --> 06:37:11,639
All right, so the chest piece it goes from three to five

1718
06:37:13,669 --> 06:37:17,529
Or I could do the helmet

1719
06:37:17,529 --> 06:37:19,610
Three to five three to five is the same thing

1720
06:37:23,459 --> 06:37:27,880
Maybe the armor

1721
06:37:27,880 --> 06:37:30,340
I feel like the helmet

1722
06:37:30,340 --> 06:37:34,340
Because if I find a much better chest piece, I could still keep the helmet on

1723
06:37:40,299 --> 06:37:48,169
i'm doing it

1724
06:37:48,169 --> 06:38:05,939
Thank you five armor nice set of clothes that have all been enhanced twice can have a bonus

1725
06:38:06,340 --> 06:38:08,099
But you have to wear the whole thing

1726
06:38:08,099 --> 06:38:22,810
I mean i'm wearing the pants

1727
06:38:23,689 --> 06:38:42,299
I mean, why not?

1728
06:38:42,299 --> 06:38:46,380
How hard is it? I feel like these materials are not hard to get so i'm just gonna do it

1729
06:38:51,139 --> 06:38:57,020
Just in case at least a level one stuff

1730
06:39:07,689 --> 06:39:13,529
Very cool. Okay. Now I did

1731
06:39:15,930 --> 06:39:22,419
Upgraded my gear

1732
06:39:22,419 --> 06:39:25,619
That was step one of two now i'm going over here

1733
06:39:31,430 --> 06:39:34,069
To see if that guy's there to do inventory slots

1734
06:39:40,279 --> 06:39:42,459
Then i'm gonna wrap it up

1735
06:39:43,659 --> 06:39:51,580
This doesn't do this

1736
06:39:51,819 --> 06:39:54,310
I don't know what to do with this

1737
06:39:54,869 --> 06:40:14,169
The ball somewhere

1738
06:40:14,169 --> 06:40:20,840
You can do this again next stream. I will do this again on sunday plan is to do

1739
06:40:21,959 --> 06:40:25,639
Uh slime rancher 2 comes into early access tomorrow

1740
06:40:26,520 --> 06:40:28,520
So i'll do that on saturday

1741
06:40:29,049 --> 06:40:32,090
And we'll help back into breath of the wild on sunday and then after that we'll see

1742
06:40:33,779 --> 06:40:36,919

1743
06:40:37,240 --> 06:40:45,990
You actually want to keep playing this

Yeah, I mean if you guys like watching it then why not i'm having a good time if you like it

1745
06:40:50,709 --> 06:40:52,709
If you want me to continue and you want me to beat it

1746
06:40:53,189 --> 06:40:55,189
Then i'll just keep playing it

1747
06:41:01,990 --> 06:41:08,099
Yeah, definitely

1748
06:41:08,099 --> 06:41:11,459
All right. Where are you?

1749
06:41:11,459 --> 06:41:12,740
Yeah, you're still there

1750
06:41:12,740 --> 06:41:24,700
All right. I got five of these

1751
06:41:24,700 --> 06:41:25,900
All right

1752
06:41:25,900 --> 06:41:26,779
I

1753
06:41:26,779 --> 06:41:30,659
another weapon stash

1754
06:41:30,659 --> 06:41:32,659
I go through weapons. So crazy

1755
06:41:32,979 --> 06:41:34,340
and then maybe

1756
06:41:34,340 --> 06:41:36,340
field

1757
06:41:36,419 --> 06:41:45,659
What about splatoon 3 i'll do that too at some point

1758
06:41:55,959 --> 06:41:59,319
Wait, what bring some to korok forest?

1759
06:42:06,700 --> 06:42:10,020
Uh, whatever

1760
06:42:10,020 --> 06:42:11,779
Okay. Well, at least I did that

1761
06:42:11,779 --> 06:42:21,270
See you later speaking to see you later. I'll see you later

1762
06:42:39,639 --> 06:42:42,840
North of here all the Hylia river and continue north. Okay

1763
06:42:45,290 --> 06:42:48,680
Yeah, i'll see you later the next couple days i'm gonna do some birthday stuff

1764
06:42:49,819 --> 06:42:51,819
I appreciate uh, everyone hanging out though

1765
06:42:52,220 --> 06:42:55,459
Maybe we'll see you again

1766
06:42:55,459 --> 06:42:58,919
a couple days

1767
06:42:58,919 --> 06:43:03,240
Slime rancher 2 going into early. I don't know how much content will be in slime rancher 2 is early access

1768
06:43:03,240 --> 06:43:16,840
So I will find out but i'll see you later. Thanks for watching

1769
06:43:18,020 --> 06:43:23,220
Save your game. I will do it right now officially saved

1770
06:43:28,099 --> 06:43:32,840
Okay, they were a shitload of subs today

1771
06:43:36,040 --> 06:43:43,529
This is 25 pages of subs. Are you kidding me? Oh my god. Well, thank you

1772
06:43:44,169 --> 06:44:07,080
I'll have a good birthday. I'm just i'm just gonna it's gonna be chill our prime subs included in the credits

1773
06:44:07,080 --> 06:44:11,639
I think all subs are any sub that comes through during the time the stream is live. I think is there

1774
06:44:15,430 --> 06:44:17,349
Yeah, there was some big gifted subs, too

1775
06:44:17,349 --> 06:44:38,599
Yeah, i'm sure probably some of you saw the news about twitch's changing how they monetizing partners. Let me just be very clear

1776
06:44:39,830 --> 06:44:45,400
Um, I ain't fucking running ads. It's just not happening

1777
06:44:46,389 --> 06:44:47,189
So

1778
06:44:47,189 --> 06:44:57,619
We'll see however that plays out

1779
06:44:57,619 --> 06:45:03,689
I mean, I I obviously have opinions on it and you know, one of the major ones is

1780
06:45:05,130 --> 06:45:12,860
I don't want to be forced to run ads because in my mind a ton of people are already paying

1781
06:45:14,090 --> 06:45:17,400
Essentially a premium to the stream

1782
06:45:19,930 --> 06:45:26,459
So I don't oh, yeah, thanks for your essentially kind of like netflix like subscription

1783
06:45:28,009 --> 06:45:33,110
Here's a shitload of ads every day. I don't want to do that. So i'm i'm not going to

1784
06:45:35,189 --> 06:45:44,229
Um, if I am forced to run ads on this platform, I will leave this platform

1785
06:45:46,500 --> 06:45:53,380
100%

1786
06:45:53,380 --> 06:45:55,049
so

1787
06:45:55,049 --> 06:45:57,049
I'm not going to be forced to run ads

1788
06:46:00,360 --> 06:46:06,380
Now here's the thing ads do play pre-rolls play and I don't really have that much control over that

1789
06:46:06,860 --> 06:46:15,060
I do have control over if one essentially runs while you're sitting here and I don't want to do that

1790
06:46:15,139 --> 06:46:17,700
I don't want to run ads

1791
06:46:17,700 --> 06:46:22,020
You've seen ads on big streams before sometimes to fill dead air

1792
06:46:22,659 --> 06:46:24,630
sometimes part of a

1793
06:46:24,630 --> 06:46:40,819
Obligation but regardless of of how they're changing subscription revenue. I'm not going to run ads. Let's run an ad right now

1794
06:46:42,540 --> 06:46:45,180
Ads aren't that bad ads aren't that bad

1795
06:46:46,040 --> 06:46:49,799
They really aren't in the grand scheme of things if it depends on how many you run

1796
06:46:50,680 --> 06:46:59,299
But I don't want to be forced to do them the thing about ads, especially on twitch. They're pretty intrusive

1797
06:46:59,540 --> 06:47:06,819
For a few reasons one if they happen automatically we could be in the middle of doing something

1798
06:47:07,299 --> 06:47:14,119
And you're just gone for two to three straight fucking minutes. It takes over the whole screen. You don't even

1799
06:47:14,840 --> 06:47:19,720
What if you missed something interesting like one of eight or like one of four or one of three?

1800
06:47:19,720 --> 06:47:24,840
Whatever it is now running ads on a brb is something that okay

1801
06:47:24,919 --> 06:47:27,080
Yeah, that may maybe that would make sense

1802
06:47:27,080 --> 06:47:42,150
But I don't want to be forced to run ads if you're contractually obligated to run ads

1803
06:47:42,150 --> 06:47:50,139
Yeah, that's not the case right now, but I don't want that to be the case and if it does become the case

1804
06:47:50,299 --> 06:48:05,259
I'll just leave I mean that I really do the phrase ads aren't that bad as a weak mindset

1805
06:48:05,580 --> 06:48:07,580
You're okay with what happened losing imperfection

1806
06:48:08,659 --> 06:48:10,659
Uh, is that a meme? What is that?

1807
06:48:23,340 --> 06:48:25,580
Oh, it's the ninja thing, okay

1808
06:48:26,779 --> 06:48:33,880
But I just want to be clear about that because I know that a lot of people might be saying oh shit

1809
06:48:35,639 --> 06:48:37,639
Which is changing how money and

1810
06:48:38,520 --> 06:48:43,319
He's gonna quote have to make up the money. No, I don't give a fuck. No, I don't care

1811
06:48:44,840 --> 06:48:48,040
If you I want people to have the best viewing experience if I can

1812
06:48:48,919 --> 06:48:52,360
I'm not gonna just run ads if I have to i'll just i'll literally stream

1813
06:48:52,680 --> 06:48:55,000
I'll literally make fucking videos again or something. I don't know

1814
06:49:14,419 --> 06:49:18,500
Yeah, I don't know I i'm not gonna make any statements about

1815
06:49:19,459 --> 06:49:24,340
I have some ideas of maybe I would want to change platforms or something, right? That's not what this is for

1816
06:49:25,299 --> 06:49:26,659
a lot of these

1817
06:49:26,659 --> 06:49:29,700
Changes are not even happening till like the what the middle of next year

1818
06:49:30,979 --> 06:49:33,299
So there's lots of time to figure out what I would want to do

1819
06:49:38,819 --> 06:49:39,860
and

1820
06:49:39,860 --> 06:49:40,919
if

1821
06:49:40,919 --> 06:49:44,919
Which changes a lot of their policies to make it so you have to run ads or something. It's like, I don't know

1822
06:49:46,060 --> 06:49:47,500
I'd rather just

1823
06:49:47,580 --> 06:49:53,419
Stream off like youtube and not have to do that if I didn't have to and let me maybe make videos again

1824
06:49:54,299 --> 06:49:55,659
I don't know

1825
06:49:55,659 --> 06:49:58,599
I really don't know

1826
06:49:59,319 --> 06:50:02,360
But i'm trying to be transparent with everybody right now

1827
06:50:04,220 --> 06:50:09,419
Um, and that's me being transparent

1828
06:50:15,029 --> 06:50:19,590
We got about uh, 10 months before this is even a question to even figure out

1829
06:50:20,389 --> 06:50:23,049
So don't worry. It's not like oh, all right. Well

1830
06:50:23,049 --> 06:50:24,630
That's

1831
06:50:24,630 --> 06:50:26,790
See you on see on youtube tomorrow. No

1832
06:50:27,430 --> 06:50:31,509
Uh, this is like a year away before a major decision like that will have to get made

1833
06:50:35,209 --> 06:50:37,209
But i'm going

1834
06:50:37,689 --> 06:50:41,369
I'm gonna be where I think is the best viewing experience for people here
