1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:17,780
Hey, what's up? How you doing? You guys tweet? Yeah, I'm tweeting. I gotta make sure people

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,469
pee. I gotta make sure people know what's going on. My fan's not even on. What the heck did you do

3
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:34,539
to me? You beaten Margit yet? No, and I don't know. Like once enough people come here, we'll talk

4
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:42,140
about it for a minute. This is Elden. This is like my 12th or like 14th. This is like at least number

5
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,799
12 Elden rank streams. And sometimes you just kind of have to understand the games like not for you.

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:57,259
I mean we're about like 100 hours into the game and I still have not. This is the first boss, right?

7
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,770
I just don't get it. I don't understand like the dodging and shit. And I tried to summon, I've

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,129
summoned like three people to come in but they always like die because I always just kind of

9
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,700
watch because I don't really know how to play. I don't know. I'm gonna try it one more time.

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,849
But I mean there's only so many times. I think I've died 1,600 times to Margit. I mean I feel

11
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:25,849
like that's not that like high. It's like a hard game. Only like 40% of people that

12
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:31,379
downloaded the game even bought that and killed that boss, okay? I've looked at the steam

13
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:37,780
achievement. Like 50% or something have killed Margit. So I mean it's a hard fucking game.

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,549
You got it this time. I'll try, I'll do it one more time.

15
00:01:51,859 --> 00:02:02,359
You know where Newfoundland is? I don't know. I think so. That's a weird question. You're still

16
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:11,270
on the tree sentinel. You know though if you're okay if you are stuck on the tree sentinel for

17
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:19,449
like five days I don't even know if I would be too upset about that. That means you you're going to

18
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:24,840
be able to play Elden Ring for the next like five years of your life. You will get to slowly

19
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,000
experience this game for a half a decade. You'll be able to put it down and pick it up at random times

20
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:44,740
until you have children. And I'll be honest this game is so long I feel like if you just put

21
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,180
a few hours into this game every like four or five days or something it will take you a year or two

22
00:02:50,180 --> 00:03:04,300
to beat this game. So that's that's just extra content you get to have because the game is good

23
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:12,060
as smite. Well I mean hold on I don't want to be I don't want to be like just handing out like

24
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,419
game of the decade awards right? We have to be careful because we have one.

25
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,960
All right let's go let's fucking go. I just spent the first like five minutes of this stream

26
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:35,419
I think I don't like gaslighting everybody I don't know why. There's no sound? I got it got it. So um

27
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:42,539
I might not be in the same position I was last stream because I was doing uh Polly's been playing

28
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,550
and we did co-op stuff. Something I didn't know about Elden Ring I don't I've never done like

29
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:59,340
co-op in any of Souls games. Um we we're getting invaded every one second after I we would summon

30
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,060
each other if you're like oh let's go explore like the lands between honey oh that sounds like this

31
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:19,579
person there and then just to kill us what the fuck we did kill a few invasions only happen in

32
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:31,180
co-op oh use a password we did I swear to god we did it was like okay here I am my summoning sign

33
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,379
I would like I would just barely phase into the world and they would be within 15 seconds somebody

34
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,800
else would be doing the same thing and then it's just like oh fuck here we go and you either get

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,560
rid of the person or you get embarrassed a password doesn't do anything for invasions don't use one

36
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:57,750
two three four what the fuck one two three four five is a secure password it's sequential it's

37
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:18,470
easy to remember it's very acable one two that's got to be I would feel I don't know I would feel

38
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,620
naked if I had a password that was one two three four five somewhere you know what I mean I would

39
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:34,579
feel awful every day every day wouldn't you feel awful I would just be like like especially if it

40
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:40,579
was like oh hey dude I bet you you won't go one week having one two three four five as your bank

41
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:51,939
password every moment of every second of every single day I'd be like looking at my phone like

42
00:05:51,939 --> 00:06:10,709
dude nobody got it right nobody got in no fucking way did you play it as a me strong no okay then

43
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,629
you have to start okay then you have to start making new passwords because oh somebody just

44
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:19,110
said oh I usually do like a similar password and add numbers at the end so do you just do

45
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,139
one two three four five six seven oh no I remember one two three four five but like I got to add

46
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,579
something to this one two three four five six seven eight nine I would that would be so confusing

47
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:37,259
because if you do that enough times all of your passwords are a sequence of one through some

48
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:47,350
number and how are you ever supposed to keep track of that it's impossible anyways I played

49
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:55,029
a little co-op with Holly and we got invaded like five times I was like all right that's fun

50
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,269
it's cool though we did well it was one part we get to kind of walk around for like 20 minutes

51
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:06,889
was fun but voice is junk and I know that's the way it is but I was doing the giant area

52
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,389
there's a few things I can do that are not in the giant area what is it what is it what's

53
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:21,139
her character uh she I believe she's faith dex or faith faith arcane she's doing the dragon stuff

54
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,769
which holy shit those spells are fucking ridiculous those spells are insane

55
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,529
the big like dragon head that breathes like the dust that stuff whoa now that's cool

56
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:51,209
dragon spells are awesome man but anyways uh I was gonna continue this is where I was going to go

57
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,430
I know that I have to get the other half of the medallion I know I know I'll and I can I ask a

58
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:18,019
question thank you um peach teacher can I go to this place right here and not like end the game

59
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:31,019
yes cherubi you won't be locked out okay I got it because this looks like

60
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,340
that looks very important whatever that is so that's what we're gonna go we're gonna go to one

61
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,220
then we're gonna go to four and then we're gonna go to bar two very excited I feel like we're

62
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:53,960
getting we're gonna get some hopefully get some big deep lore bits it does change things you don't

63
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,289
get locked out of the game until the last boss well let's go let's go do it let's go to one

64
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:08,409
a little advice for elderly people you can hit the b or circle button that enables you to

65
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:15,909
run thanks appreciate it that's pretty cool uh that's pretty cool tactic let's go to one

66
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:33,049
yeah I looked at this area it was like these are giants that may have the red bar is your health

67
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:43,450
oh I thought that was my satan meter what's happening what's behind me

68
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,750
oh what I hear okay I know I did hear some what the fuck is happening

69
00:09:51,659 --> 00:10:07,559
they're fighting the giant oh no do I help them I think you can handle it

70
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:30,090
I'm gonna help them I helped I'm gone oh god damn it all right I didn't that's a church

71
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,379
can I I think these might be the hardest enemy in the game what the fuck why do you have the

72
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:44,279
horse why am I off the horse this is the hardest enemy I think this is the toughest enemy in the

73
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:56,230
game I got invaded bloody finger this is what it felt like playing with Holly last night

74
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:13,059
yesterday whatever it was this is what it felt like volcano how about this fucking freezing mist

75
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:24,980
well bro without the r bye oh oh by the way by the way everybody you might have noticed some

76
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:35,620
spells I got some spells I all right shut up and play okay listen I went and got I fixed my spell

77
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,220
thing I had a bunch of useless spells I was trying to prepare for the stream I didn't play offline

78
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,769
well I didn't play offline I prepared offline these fingernails need to go because they're

79
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:53,860
fucking up I they're bumping into each other there's like a little too long and I might just

80
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:04,519
clip them on stream okay I cleaned up my inventory I didn't play off stream I prepared off stream

81
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:11,700
all right this time I'm not going to be an idiot and go attack the birds that are attacking that

82
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:33,289
giant prepare better I think I did I had 200 souls it doesn't matter okay here we go all right

83
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:38,330
invade me again this time there's not two or three giant birds attacking me they are probably the

84
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,769
hardest enemy in the game they're the tankiest they have the most powerful move set they're

85
00:12:43,769 --> 00:13:05,049
crazy all right just do it let's go your headphones go to ice mist does this move do anything

86
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:22,860
like I mean I guess I kind of hurt him for a second damn it that fucking hurts

87
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,570
all right no I don't care about spells anymore I'm just gonna fight the guy nice dodge I haven't

88
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:40,090
played in a while all right I gotta get back into this I was busy getting invaded all right all right

89
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:50,809
let's go ice this sucks what a fucking shitty move it's coming off yeah I like I turn the

90
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:56,649
air conditioning on a little bit higher in one area of the room that's who cares that doesn't

91
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:05,159
do anything you're playing a bimbo ice mage build I know I'm not this is a bimbo ice build

92
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:28,600
come on guys don't forget to post who just had like a million health it's somebody just took like

93
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:36,019
5 000 damage what was that did you see that okay I'm not fucking around anymore we're gonna

94
00:14:36,740 --> 00:15:38,700
this person eat the shit out of them here we go the more I storm god damn it this fucking move

95
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,809
oh my god I had him too well I don't why did I start doing swift glint stone it was to make

96
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:51,899
you guys think I was doing more than I needed to do I've asked me I'll be honest I was fighting them

97
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:59,100
perfectly normally and I was winning and then I switched to swift glyphs glint glint stone shard

98
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,580
and was like wham wham wham like I was doing a fucking like harry potter fight with this person

99
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,700
like don't I don't have to do that I don't have to like make like a scene like a cinematic scene

100
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:16,649
for you like ice stone shard like no fucking kill the guy I don't have to do that for some

101
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,730
reason my brain was like yo make it a little cinematic for him no I don't care I'm gonna kill

102
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,970
him I'm done with this I'm just gonna I'm going to attack them I don't care about the cinematic

103
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,320
experience I don't know why I did swift glint stone shard it was to be cinematic

104
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:54,789
use the swift glint stone shard whatever all right when I have I cast a spell besides

105
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:26,420
someone wears the ice storm this guy's tough oh get zoned oh somebody get zoned huh

106
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:43,339
oh David oh my god I gotta fucking kill this guy before this is my mind I'm I wasn't doing

107
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:47,180
that for cinematic purposes I was doing that because I thought it was gonna be able to cheese

108
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,720
it all right just fight him that was not for cinematic purposes that was for killing purposes

109
00:17:52,359 --> 00:18:01,500
I gotta like I gotta get back into the game man I haven't played in a while I haven't played

110
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,579
like four days ago Jerma snoozes on this guy snoozes on him I'm telling you oh all right

111
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:35,109
this is a pvp player he played this literally every stream yeah but I haven't played it every

112
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:43,619
day well I like I took I kind of look like a Simpsons character shit look at over here as

113
00:18:43,619 --> 00:19:21,619
I'm looking at myself I look like a Simpsons character why do I look like that I got my own

114
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:38,779
fucking move don't I god damn it dude don't fucking do it yeah look I look like a like a Simpsons

115
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:51,640
character I don't know why I just kind of do this is about rivers of blood best weapon and then the

116
00:19:51,640 --> 00:20:03,349
mask that's the best sword in the game oh I mean I could have guessed considering it kills you in

117
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:12,839
two hits three hits with that move uh weapon of Okina swordsman from the land of reeds a cursed

118
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:24,710
weapon that has failed countless men when Mog really the lord of blood first felt Okina's sword

119
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,230
and madness upon his flesh he had a proposal to offer Okina the life of a demon his thirst would

120
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:40,250
never go unsated that sucks it's a bog type weapon uh I can't really use it because arcane

121
00:20:40,809 --> 00:21:00,329
let's take a look at it that's that's pretty cool that's a katana all right very cool uh so

122
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:06,009
that's a mog like weapon it's fine I like I can't use it I'm sure it's great people said it's what

123
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:13,299
you guys saying pvp it's the insane and pvp arcane seems actually really cool I'm seeing a lot of

124
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:21,059
arcane weapons that I did not think were going to be in this game I thought arcane was going to be

125
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,829
one of those stats in from software games that just exists for no reason and like there'll be

126
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:31,660
like youtube videos of like I put 100 points in luck and beat the first boss right uh but it's

127
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:44,740
not it's actually that's cool okay oh uh where's my baby rattle you need to do the mog dance when

128
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:52,470
you fight him I mean well we'll probably think it's we'll probably think it's funny use a different

129
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:59,690
weapon use the darkmoon great sword it has cold damage yeah but I I have to respect and I'm not

130
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:07,509
respecting until I need to because I like this build I like the baby rattle the mog dance causes

131
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:21,180
a stun do I have enough these all right sacred tear do I have any more sacred tears very nice

132
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,589
very nice very nice I have plus 10 is that it I have a plus 10 flask now is that the maximum

133
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:34,759
amount of uh sacred tears in the game did I get there plus 12 is the maximum let's put on our

134
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:47,690
little detective shades here take a quick look around and I talk to uh usually you can talk to

135
00:22:47,690 --> 00:23:05,420
what's her name bring out the frog detective plush oh by the way people people that would give me

136
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,609
shit people that would give me shit you see what's on the shelf right there you see that I got them

137
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:21,819
I told you that I was gonna get them see it's the it's the award yeah because I didn't I forgot them

138
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:42,200
you see it right here okay they are hanging out back there one of them is just kind of standing

139
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:54,619
on one leg it's broken that's okay by the way what's what's the formula for facecam size

140
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:58,700
they have there's definitely like a screen resolution scale for facecam because this is

141
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:08,650
too big right and this is way too small what's the goldilocks setting for facecam I think that's

142
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,750
fine I think that's good you don't want to be too you don't want to be too big because it covers

143
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,869
too much of the game we don't want to be too small because then you can't see my fucking fog

144
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:33,529
reaction right here you think I think right here's fine yeah that's fine about the size

145
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:40,180
of a postage stamp that's decent yeah I know I don't it's I don't want to be bigger it's it

146
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:56,180
takes up too much space that's all that's there so let's get on the uh horse it's a big head

147
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,619
all right so I mean it's very obvious at this point I think at least from my brain

148
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,420
these are gigantic skulls like gigantic way bigger than the giants that are here way bigger

149
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:15,079
than any giant we've fought in the game so far so like the fingers are they're their fingers

150
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:22,759
right this has to be like giant fingers nobody has hands that big right I think that's my theory

151
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:33,720
that there are like ultra omega giants that those are their hands right okay what's that

152
00:25:40,170 --> 00:26:03,619
check the skull's mouth I'm safe in here all right I'm safe in here actually I can cheese you

153
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:15,910
that's what we're gonna do I don't think I've ever killed one of these

154
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,269
four thousand souls damn did they drop anything wait there's another one oh

155
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:58,380
where's the other one I heard it all right well I'm gonna take it what I take what I can get here

156
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:19,750
no you didn't get out you're fine falling I just want to go in this thing's mouth stop

157
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:35,640
leave me alone actually kind of terrifying so in the mouth okay I'll check it had to be so

158
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:47,130
cinematic because there's a legendary in here I would have walked by this ancient dragon smithing

159
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:59,579
stone oh that's a that's to get something to max level all right all right well thanks for I would

160
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:10,619
have just walked by that I really would have but that's to get a max upgraded weapon which I need

161
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:22,359
to make a few decisions here get these fucking birds out of here are the boosters worth it I'm

162
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,599
stuck getting one star yeah I mean if you're getting if you if you're constantly getting

163
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:31,319
one and two stars especially one star and all the if you have enough energy to play another time

164
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,279
I recommend the hammer because what it can do is it before when you go into the boss door

165
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,680
you know you have the bar that's at the bottom that's like hammer the glove and like the star

166
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,119
shards thing the hammer does is you tap it and it just the hammer comes down and when

167
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:54,119
go and it takes 40 of the boss's hp off which I think it's like it's a it's a really good

168
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,799
equalizer it is but they're expensive so don't use too many of them I have like four left I

169
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:15,140
bought the pack with like 10 what is this I don't have any boosters left I just buy some more fire

170
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:34,549
giant it's huge oh god he's like fucking flattened me um all right date the leg it's gonna be a fight

171
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:50,740
about patience shit I just broke his I just broke his leg his femur just came out what the fuck just

172
00:29:50,740 --> 00:30:22,500
came out of him all right break both his legs the ultimate fat rolling oh shit I saw that in slow

173
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:36,089
motion maybe I'll get I'll get off the horse oh that sucks is there another bonfire or do I have

174
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:51,269
to run maybe I think I am gonna get off the horse for this now I guys I don't have any more hour

175
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:58,809
glasses I use the last one they're like a dollar 99 each I cannot freeze the boss for two minutes

176
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,839
I cannot I fucking well it's just our time that people love to say that I have not I don't have

177
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:25,349
any more is there there's a closer bonfire that's the boss door so oh shit this one right here he's

178
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:32,710
trying so hard to make it work I mean it's the title of the stream I need to try at least for a

179
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:49,369
few minutes I mean I have a VIP pass you know I will say for every time somebody says they hate

180
00:31:49,369 --> 00:32:05,539
a joke a few weeks later people beg me to do them how many scenarios of like dude fucking stop

218
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,400
it's like you know you have like four or five like like lock on points I don't know I just

219
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,119
like imagine like a whole like a whole like fucking warcraft party all like targeting

221
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,820

225
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:11,130
where he was I didn't even know where his fucking arms were dude from software can I have an opinion

226
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:16,250
here if you have an enemy that's 400 feet tall can you please give us a fucking power ranger power

227
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:23,829
but we could just grow as big as they are like they did that in the power rangers it's just like

228
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:28,150
they that was oh he got huge time to get in the mega zord and fucking fight the guy

229
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:42,150
this is this is a wash right here there's no way we're fucking three flasks you have to shit

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:53,269
me with a dead horse too it's a god damn miracle fucking baby flail that swings straight down by

231
00:45:53,269 --> 00:46:31,929
the way I want to say this again it's cool dude right in the eye get him in the eye this is hitting

232
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:58,469
him in the eye not even fucking hitting him get out of the way I'm not even fucking hitting this guy

233
00:46:58,469 --> 00:47:24,199
get out of the way fuck you what oh my god the fucking range is just like I cannot close enough

234
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:40,329
to fucking hit him I gotta use this no no no what do I use against this I can't go that close

235
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:54,630
get off your horse this is shit no it's not a shitty weapon oh my god I'm so fucking dumb

237
00:48:17,719 --> 00:49:00,619

238
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,619
get off the horse dude when I get off the horse this dickhead jumps backwards and then starts

239
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:25,179
throwing shit at me no that's not what I wanted to do well in case I lose my way let's try you

242
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,619
you know what let him come to us it's always our it's our we're on ho we're the home team

243
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:55,929
let's get this time okay because I'm not running out there because when I'm out there he's just

00:49:55,929 --> 00:50:34,059
smoke he's so ready okay here he comes jump he's stupid get him I love that guy

245

246
00:50:40,360 --> 00:51:00,570
idea to fight him over here all right I broke his leg I'm getting back on the horse by the way

247
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:18,860
it moved oh my god video games are not fun why would I bring the fire surface to fight the fire

248
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:30,659
giant that's probably a bad idea actually kind of awesome though just get free and get up

249
00:51:41,260 --> 00:52:04,840
hey hey did he fall off where's my circle oh god there's an edge get away from the edge I'll

250
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:19,130
fall off that edge get away from that please get away from the edge you you didn't even try to hit

251
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:39,079
me no come on the one thing that you shouldn't have fucking done and you did it and this thing's

252
00:52:39,079 --> 00:53:22,730
gonna explode no I knew that was gonna happen all right keep going I don't need summons or

253
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:27,769
anything just go go that second phase is not a big deal he's gonna get in there hit him in the

254
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:43,750
eyeball or something I don't know do the wind move the wind can I jump on this and ride up his

255
00:53:43,750 --> 00:55:03,460
body idiot your hand I don't even fucking know where the guy is man god damn it

256
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:17,980
yes I'd like to get on the horse make that toggle in the options farm software for the love of god

257
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:23,179
make it a check mark just a check mark in the options like oh do you want to confirm to get

258
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:29,340
on the horse no check mark in the options a check box a square that you check no I don't I know

259
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:36,360
I don't want to confirm to get on the horse after after it dies it's a check box solves that

260
00:55:36,360 --> 00:56:11,340
hmm let's go boys all right do not summon them yet now something here we go

261
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:34,260
god it's so easy just to fucking have the camera spin around and lose track of the guy

262
00:56:35,539 --> 00:57:11,880
walking on not walking on it all sucks Jesus man get out what do you fucking happen

263

00:58:47,590 --> 00:59:11,219
the hands the edge was right there I had nowhere to go the edge was right I was gonna run that way

265
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:25,829
but the edge was right there oh no second I need to have what am I have for gear that fucking

266
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:43,260
kills you instantly fuck you what gears not gonna help um off the off the horse in the second phase

267
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,699
that's probably a good idea but fuck man like sometimes you just get caught like that you just

268
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:54,789
can't there's nowhere to go if I had gone forward I would fall off the shit I'm gonna get off the

269
00:59:54,789 --> 01:00:02,170
horse in the second phase press L1 on the horse it goes I know it goes the other way I've been

270
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:07,610
doing that since I started the fucking goddamn video game I jumped over that I did I don't

271

303
01:11:53,100 --> 01:12:14,170

that okay what do you get for this giants red braid strength decks and faith hefty whip woven

305
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:44,229
from the flame red hair of a fire giant every giant is red of hair and radigan was said to have

306
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:54,970
despised his own red locks perhaps that was a curse of their kind flame dance or burn oh

307
01:12:54,970 --> 01:13:02,380
flame 27 faith raises a series of flame pillars around caster can't really use either one of

308
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:09,909
these can i there's flame pillars charging yeah yeah yeah the fire giants borrowed from the power

309
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:16,310
of a fell god and still they were defeated yet their failure released them from their solitary

310
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:26,010
curse to serve as keepers of the flame for eternity I'll just break it look at how red

311

313
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,159
minutes or an hour I kind of just like it's almost like somebody's like crafted me out of clay or

314
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:54,359
something and then like I'm just gonna go to shit in an hour I can only show up to a function for

01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:17,350
yeah I mean this is gonna be easy say that now but it is

364
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:27,659

365
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:36,739
okay if I lose to this guy at level like 110

366
01:24:36,739 --> 01:25:12,979

368
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:44,659
mugs bidet would probably like really hurt if it was a spell that's got to clean like a like 500

369
01:25:44,659 --> 01:25:51,829
foot tall asshole that's probably gonna kill you okay forms a defensive arch of larger magic

378
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:11,029
kind of cool even the knights who weathered by misfortune or misdeed were forced to abandon

379
01:28:11,029 --> 01:28:15,029
their homes most of these knights were sent to the fringes where they were forced to start anew

380
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:29,289
with only to spare for company and a lot of raw meat dumplings you can sort by new really good

381

387
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:46,380
mission here are you sure was it verified because there's a lot of mog uh imposters that think um

388
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:51,020
they like pretend to be mog and stuff I don't think I don't think the real mog even has twitter

389
01:29:51,739 --> 01:29:59,300
I mean I have I got a phone number so we text and shit I don't think I remember him talking

about twitter there we go I'm gonna kill this pretty yeah how did I not come over here and do

391
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:38,970
this and you can even though I I could still die so don't be stupid all right more of those uh

392
01:30:38,970 --> 01:31:01,420
flask tears what do I get durillian crystal tear and ruptured crystal tear where are those they're

393
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:13,319
like in a weird place in there causes concoction to explode in mixed physique a defective crystal

394
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:17,079
tear which possess absolutely no medicinal quality so lessons said to be learned the hard way for

395
01:31:17,079 --> 01:31:26,579
some faith can be volatile matter after all causes concoction to explode so wait I drink this and

396
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:43,289
explode it's op what's the other thing I got stores half of total fp what do I have on now

397
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:48,649
eliminates all fp consumption and I don't think I even need why would I use that when I have this

398
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:55,609
this is just a better version of this I have like 10 to 15 seconds to cast spells for free

399
01:31:55,609 --> 01:32:01,479
this just gives me half of my fp it does a huge amount of a way use explode with no soul loss for

400
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:16,300

424
01:37:47,689 --> 01:37:57,859
year you only change your oil once a year seems like you're doing a little bit more than that

425
01:37:57,859 --> 01:38:20,619
every um three thousand miles I don't drive much all right I gotta break up enough oil for me to

433
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:52,779

434
01:40:52,779 --> 01:41:13,800
the animaniacs it's you well what do you make of it what's happened to this village I just got

435
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:20,680
here witnessed a sight much the same in my infancy the oppression of the weak murder and pillage

436
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:30,890
unchecked a waking nightmare made by men but this time I'm a woman grown and though the

437
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:38,500
suffering cannot be undone I can still meet out justice justice to the oppressors let the scars

438
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:49,880
I carve remind them I am the felly Lou warrior oh right okay um but this time I'm a woman grown

439
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:57,340
and though the suffering cannot be undone I can push in class justice justice to the oppressors

440
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:13,300
I'm like 16 days ago I don't think I need to open those notes anymore this time though the suffer

441
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:25,239
well cool so this is dead the guy fucking died I can't even that's so funny didn't even get a

442
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:37,270
chance yeah syllabus had an entire other character arc it's like in episode two in the in the anime

443
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:42,310
of Elden Ring he gave the task to the character excuse me somebody just throw a fucking board at

444
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:52,500
me and then like 12 episodes later he's just dead and you what you realize is they there was

445
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:58,420
like a the director of the show just cut out the whole fucking part of like episode nine that was

446
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:04,579
like 14 minutes of content and she's like why did they do that it's just like well I wanted to

447
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:08,260
kind of see what happened why did they do that why why would they cut the entire half of that

448
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:15,449
episode's arc out it's like oh we weren't sure that people were going to enjoy that that part

449
01:43:15,449 --> 01:43:21,930
of the anime so we just got rid of it right away this village is done for even if it's just you

450
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:46,439
old albus hide well and still your breath albus oh albus's shack they all they all kind of live

451
01:43:46,439 --> 01:43:50,119
like this there are i've seen better bathroom stalls with more privacy right like this

452
01:43:52,279 --> 01:44:05,899
like it's kept ridiculous like this is all these open fucking things i would hope so

453
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:19,100
i'm talking about the like all right let me tell you i've have i talked about this the slices in

454
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:30,920
the bathroom stalls i fucking hate it i don't understand why they have to exist it make it

455
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:37,770
infuriates me i know um yeah america america there are there's not there's no real privacy

456
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:46,119
in an american bathroom some of them are literally this wide so when you sit there

457
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:52,039
and you realize that like like you don't have any fucking privacy i don't know why it can't

458
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:57,939
just be walled why can't it just be walled why people not know what i'm talking about here

459
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:13,289
it's like these little slivers of area that nobody knows what i'm talking about it's because there

460
01:45:13,289 --> 01:45:23,800
is this is i think this is solely an american problem from what i've heard but anyways yeah

461
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:34,119
it's so fucking dumb i hate it i actually hate it i avoid going to the bathroom like i avoid

462
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:40,380
shitting in a public bathroom because i hate that like you just open on all sides

463
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:59,939
it's the wrong way i was everyone avoids that but i i truly avoid it i actually don't do it

we do that in america why did we do that in america but nowhere else on earth

476
01:48:54,359 --> 01:48:59,350
anybody have an actual logical reason for it it's cheaper

477
01:49:00,069 --> 01:49:20,439
i said i don't care dude oh god i don't care it's because of money but i was it's really cheaper or

478
01:49:21,319 --> 01:49:29,289
i feel like is it to have the pieces of like steel or aluminum whatever the fuck they are

479
01:49:29,289 --> 01:49:35,850
go an extra like quarter of an inch that can't be that that has to be like five cents per door

572
02:15:41,590 --> 02:15:52,710
do when you start streaming is be able to just like that one it's weird it's uh it's actually

path to the halig tree all right so i gotta follow these what is the halig tree i guess

613
02:26:34,229 --> 02:26:46,860
why ask that question when we're gonna find out probably in like two minutes it's like watching

614
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:55,659
a marvel movie it's like watching infinity war and just not seeing it for the first time you sit

615
02:26:55,659 --> 02:27:02,340
with like a room of people like Thanos is going like this you lean over going hey dude is he gonna

fair you want to play that game we can play that fucking game fine we'll play that game all right

621
02:28:52,819 --> 02:29:03,510
these enemies suck uh they have a lot of health um i'm not following the lights anymore which is

622
02:29:03,510 --> 02:29:11,299
probably bad i guess i maybe i should until i find a map fragment which i'm sure there is one

623
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:52,379
am i hitting something else oh okay go up here this is it no that's a fucking rock

624

somber spitting stone eight very useful i do need the other one though is this it why is it all

625
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:44,649
surrounding here now oh shit saint trina's torch what is that oh shit i lost the lights where are

626
02:30:44,649 --> 02:31:00,340
they got a light i need a light saint trina's torch how's his sleep build up decks and faith

627
02:31:00,979 --> 02:31:07,670
handles stand towards the burns with a light purple flame carvings depict saint trina but in

628
02:31:07,670 --> 02:31:20,729
adult form somewhat unnervingly the light purple flame induces sleep okay i can't use it oh nice

629
02:31:21,530 --> 02:31:39,239
i really need that considering how horrible it is to see here well that was i'm gonna help you guys

630
02:31:39,239 --> 02:31:44,709
because like that was seriously pathetic how did you even get here dude you're so level one

631
02:31:45,350 --> 02:31:53,719
how did you get here this was a lost player he doesn't he doesn't know where he's supposed to be

632
02:31:54,940 --> 02:32:02,520
dude can i suggest east limb grave you're not you're way too low to be here i know you're gonna get

633
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:06,760
really mad because you're gonna get killed in one hit this is to teach you that you need to your

634
02:32:06,760 --> 02:32:25,430
like you go go back to like the limb grave he warped to the end game zone and then he returned

635
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:47,180
the game to fucking target this game sucks i don't get it it's funny because i i have that

636
02:32:47,180 --> 02:32:52,059
perspective of not understanding how these games are supposed to be played and not just not getting

637
02:32:52,059 --> 02:32:58,379
it and being and just being like i don't get it like why are these fun what's the point if you go

638
02:32:58,379 --> 02:33:05,059
to my if you go watch my dark souls prepare to die it was like 2012 i didn't get it i didn't

639
02:33:05,059 --> 02:33:10,100
understand the game that was not me playing with any experience at all with any of these games it

640
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:15,459
was it was just kind of like oh this i know this released and i know it's like a hard game that's

641
02:33:15,459 --> 02:33:21,299
it i didn't get it um it's actually kind of a stupid video to watch i don't even know why

642
02:33:21,299 --> 02:33:27,579
i don't have it deleted like it's so bad i just walk around with a shield and talk about how little

643
02:33:27,579 --> 02:33:32,540
the shield is like oh look at my baby shield and i was trying to block with the parry buckler

644
02:33:34,250 --> 02:33:38,010
i fell off the clip a few times and then i didn't i don't think i even got out of the tutorial zone

645
02:33:38,489 --> 02:33:43,530
like i don't think i even i think i beat the asylum demon and that was it i was like oh i

646
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:49,430
did it okay i played enough to make a video it's like dude that's like the first five minutes of

647
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:59,000
the game all right i'm kind of lost we yeah we we did rewatch this recently like a year or two ago

648
02:33:59,719 --> 02:34:11,530
shit all right i gotta go back and look for those things there's a road here

649
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:25,270
how bad is the bit rate on the stream right now i'm curious actually good no way really

650
02:34:25,829 --> 02:34:46,409
i feel like it'd be terrible oh grace you can actually see that's a good thing

651
02:34:51,819 --> 02:34:59,290
that's it is that the same one that i got already i think it is you're so close

652
02:34:59,290 --> 02:35:07,770
to mog i'm sure i am i gotta be careful because i almost have enough souls to level up again which

653
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:22,090
is crazy i've already gotten to 80 000 souls almost can i just spend them all right well

654
02:35:22,090 --> 02:35:40,069
finally get the map is this the halic tree consecrated snow field this is probably right

655
02:35:40,069 --> 02:36:01,979
here i think it's that i think i think it's that i gotta pee you're back pee time first pee of the

656
02:36:01,979 --> 02:44:29,079
night i'm gonna get a refill right back okay i am back how do i how do i not startle you guys when

657
02:44:29,079 --> 02:44:37,719
i come back i just realized this i you it's just hi what should i say what should i do should i

658
02:44:37,719 --> 02:44:45,000
like tap or something because i have a little bit of compression on my microphone so it makes my

659
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:57,049
lows higher in my highs lower whatever right just whisper good all right so that took a little bit

660
02:44:57,049 --> 02:45:07,110
longer i wanted to get a i wanted to get another uh drink i made another green tea drink but this

661
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:16,010
is very interesting because we just got pretty major reveal at this point in the game there is

662
02:45:16,010 --> 02:45:27,110
another tree is this tree apparently this this is looks pretty big that's this looks that looks

663
02:45:27,110 --> 02:45:34,250
kind of this looks like this looks big so there's the urd tree and then there's this other tree

664
02:45:34,889 --> 02:46:03,959
i have officially revealed the entire elden ring map it's official look at that that's cool all

667
02:46:19,899 --> 02:46:27,450

02:47:16,549 --> 02:47:22,629
the night bike inflamed yellow seared with repulsive fingerprint burn akin to those that marred his

671
02:47:22,629 --> 02:47:28,709
entire body if offered to the blind maiden it will lead her to the source of the distant light

672
02:47:28,709 --> 02:47:38,200
allowing her to become a finger maiden eat this didn't i get i swear to god why were we talking

675
02:48:02,899 --> 02:48:08,340
people called the omen and these ones were made to keep a particular omen under strict confinement

676
02:48:09,340 --> 02:48:14,299
though faint the shackle still retain vestiges of power and have to trap the once-bound mogg on

677
02:48:14,299 --> 02:48:22,579
earth can't use it only for a short time all right well whatever i let's just let's start

what makes an urn tree an urn tree right like if there's a there's a halic tree up there

695
02:52:56,010 --> 02:53:00,889
is a halic tree an urn tree or they just start as just a tree and they turn into one of these

696
02:53:00,889 --> 02:53:11,799
things i don't everybody always talks about like baddie right like oh man sorry i'll just watch

697
02:53:11,799 --> 02:53:18,059
the baddie video and i'll figure it all out and like can we like give baddie some credit here

698
02:53:18,059 --> 02:53:25,299
a lot of it he has the monumental task of having to sort all this shit out for everybody

699
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:37,959
that seems like impossible i don't even like where do you even start like this is the world

700
02:53:37,959 --> 02:53:42,680
is so huge and there's so much to think about there's so much to do so many pieces of individual

701
02:53:42,680 --> 02:53:54,309
lore i forgot like half of it already yeah the amount of people that have to come together to

702
02:53:54,309 --> 02:54:03,750
give knowledge to kind of figure out what the hell even just happened in the game there are

703
02:54:03,750 --> 02:54:09,770
people still figuring shit out probably but when i used to do like youtube videos like all right so

704
02:54:09,770 --> 02:54:17,180
the spy came out with a new knife that's i it does 10 more damage and um it has

705
02:54:18,700 --> 02:54:24,059
it freezes people when you kill them wow that took a long time to figure that out

706
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:29,159
if i was if i was making elden ring lore videos oh my god i'd have like a spreadsheet that was

707
02:54:29,159 --> 02:54:45,209
like 5000 pages high that'd be a lot harder you really should do the sewer boss i don't

708
02:54:45,290 --> 02:55:05,940
i don't know what that means i'm closer me strong will take care of it this this is

709
02:55:05,940 --> 02:55:27,879
for whatever it is i don't know i just lightning enhancements probably definitely going down there

710
02:55:27,879 --> 02:55:30,920
without a doubt that's a cool it looks like the haunted mansion of disneyland

711
02:55:33,879 --> 02:55:45,260
all right but am i going to get my ass kicked by this thing i'm afraid of this

712
02:55:46,979 --> 02:56:03,079
it might be an avatar here i don't see a statue so i must i don't know is there a boss

713
02:56:03,719 --> 02:56:38,729
maybe not like it would have spawned already something back there kind of what i gotta get

714
02:56:38,729 --> 02:56:55,559
them oh no i don't just do this let's move the game even i offer a warp point here

715
02:56:58,489 --> 02:57:02,250
i will absolutely keep so what's wrong with why is there nothing uh at this surgery

716
02:57:03,049 --> 02:57:22,149
holding sunflower nothing over here or something behind it it's empty so um

717
02:57:23,030 --> 02:57:41,299
what's behind it and what's with the tree these the phantom tree right it's weird like what's

718
02:57:41,299 --> 02:58:05,459
with that they look cool you have to have a significance is what they do right what's over

719
02:58:05,459 --> 02:58:22,280
here i don't really that's it i feel like i'm missing something i feel like it's not this this

720
02:58:22,280 --> 02:59:10,819
simple oh what why are you abandoning your post we need to get out of this this is a weird place

721
02:59:10,819 --> 03:00:12,500
to fight you oh that hurt oh frost really is really bad on these guys what are you standing

722
03:00:12,500 --> 03:01:14,540
behind fuck off thank god jeremy don't do that one more that move is so fucking good 160 000 souls

723
03:01:14,540 --> 03:01:26,139
thorny cracked here and ruptured crystal tier 160 000 they are really piling on the souls at

724
03:01:26,139 --> 03:01:31,979
this point i'm just you know what i'm taking this right now i don't even care i'm taking one i have

725
03:01:31,979 --> 03:01:46,340
30 i have 30 fucking just take it just take one i'm never gonna use it ever so what was that i'm

726
03:01:46,340 --> 03:01:51,690
honest to god i just looked at that and got angry i have 30 of these i could use one of these every

727
03:01:51,690 --> 03:01:56,389
10 minutes and it'll last me the rest of the goddamn game i have 75 and i don't use them

728
03:01:56,389 --> 03:02:07,719
you just start using them what's the point it's plus five to every step oh it was here thorny

729
03:02:08,360 --> 03:02:21,030
consecutive attacks go stronger in mixed physique i gotta rupture two of these but if i do both of

730
03:02:21,030 --> 03:02:33,340
these is just do a double explosion what's the difference you just do an omega explosion i feel

731
03:02:33,340 --> 03:02:39,340
like that do people all right do people just drink that in pvp and just like fucking run up and blow

732
03:02:39,340 --> 03:02:48,469
up next to somebody i would assume it's probably yes so that's why they made that that's the only

733
03:02:48,549 --> 03:02:58,620
reason all right cool i need to set out a bonfire so let's hope that there's one i'm gonna assume

734
03:02:58,620 --> 03:03:05,479
that all right let's clear that so that's cool i am gonna check back here at three what's back here

735
03:03:06,040 --> 03:03:27,930
i gotta go down i'm looking for a another bonfire going to that green uh spooky manner

736
03:03:29,049 --> 03:03:33,590
all right this is where they this is where the lightning is we're gonna do this

737
03:03:34,309 --> 03:03:41,879
like that all right i'm gonna assume i'm gonna go to one first because there might be a bonfire

738
03:03:41,879 --> 03:04:03,059
here i don't see one here although there probably is one in there at least it kind of hurts my head

739
03:04:04,180 --> 03:04:16,459
we should play fortnight now they took building out i'm not into it oh come on i thought that

740
03:04:16,459 --> 03:04:30,709
was a bonfire that guy has a bone arrow i didn't want to hit that person oh my god i'm gonna die

741
03:04:31,350 --> 03:04:47,639
these guys are fucking rough okay just you're just in the fucking way i'm trying to run forward and

742
03:04:47,639 --> 03:04:56,059
i'm just like there is a thing of dog just in the way why does every single thing that has

743
03:04:56,059 --> 03:04:58,940
collision in this game have like an extra five inches around it of collision

744
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:32,139
fucking goddamn rune ark is gone too take another one it's just like it's like the huntsman sniper

745
03:05:32,139 --> 03:05:47,510
hitboxes everybody is like a gigantic cube that bumps into each other okay just go sit at the

746
03:05:47,510 --> 03:06:07,899
bottom i don't want to lose these who is who dude let's go to tf2 to tf2 i look kind of do i look

747
03:06:07,899 --> 03:06:23,579
like a little dark i look like i'm kind of like i think it turns up at this point i don't know

748
03:06:24,540 --> 03:06:31,079
intelligence is cool but is it gonna get out of reach where i can't get to like 50 health

749
03:06:31,079 --> 03:06:45,700
eventually here in a minute how much um i need 68 or 70 all right i can put the moon spell on

750
03:06:46,260 --> 03:07:04,280
let's try it i'm gonna get rid of freezing mist because i don't think it's really worth it but

751
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:13,420
here is ranny's dark moon use the caster as a vessel to incarnate a cold dark moon and sends

752
03:07:13,420 --> 03:07:19,180
it floating towards foes the dark moon dispels all sorcery that it touches temporarily reduces

753
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:27,850
magic damage negation for those it strikes okay i can now officially use this move let's see what

754
03:07:27,850 --> 03:07:55,579
it does am i my moon in here does no damage it's pretty strong direct kind of contradiction

755
03:07:55,579 --> 03:08:01,260
can't like if i go in there can they hit me you can still get hit you're immune from magic but

756
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:13,020
not physical hits okay oh yeah i'll try it i do want to level up one more time because

757
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:22,139
there's way too many souls yeah let's kill a few things it also reduces magic resistance of

758
03:08:22,139 --> 03:08:51,030
enemies hit let's go test it on this group over here hi and that's like 1600 damage i can hit

759
03:08:51,030 --> 03:09:15,979
more than one person right how far does it go damn okay that's actually pretty good all right i you're

760
03:09:15,979 --> 03:09:34,540
very vulnerable in there though i wonder if there's any good use for that like a boss fight

761
03:09:35,260 --> 03:09:55,209
shit these guys hurt a lot that's a lot of damage it really does a lot old sorcery is pretty fun

762
03:09:56,489 --> 03:10:03,899
it should be enough to level up you use it once and then their magic defense is low and you can

763
03:10:03,899 --> 03:10:26,629
spam the blade how long does it last about a minute oh so question for those of you that are

764
03:10:26,629 --> 03:10:35,500
lore masters here is it worth me getting to 70 intelligence to go get the full moon

765
03:10:36,379 --> 03:10:52,700
from ranala's resemblance is it worth doing that the dark moon is actually better so i'm

766
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:57,430
going to work on this now i'm going to get this to 50 and then we're going to do we're going to

767
03:10:57,430 --> 03:11:07,540
split once i get to 50 vigor we're going to go mind and endurance 50 50 dark was actually better

768
03:11:07,540 --> 03:11:30,170
okay let's keep going so the plan was to go up here you don't need 50 endurance no i was thinking

769
03:11:30,170 --> 03:11:38,500
again it's like 25 it has not been a problem until the last hour so i'm imagining it's because of

770
03:11:40,069 --> 03:11:45,110
uh it's kind of later in the game there's a lot more stuff you have to do a lot of more dodging

771
03:11:45,110 --> 03:11:51,190
and moving around sprinting and jumping and there anything here this is like nothing okay

772
03:11:55,190 --> 03:12:06,520
get it get it what are you doing pick it up what the fuck this game makes me so mad

773
03:12:07,159 --> 03:12:17,750
yeah i just mean for the next five to ten levels not permanently all right let's do it let's do

774
03:12:17,750 --> 03:12:39,620
the uh spooky green manner we're going double headphones by the way just a bomb or dina

775
03:12:40,420 --> 03:13:18,780
liturgical town just a boss door okay um hello can't go in there over here maybe a lot of sealed

776
03:13:18,780 --> 03:13:36,040
doors black knife hood armor gauntlets greaves hold on a sec where is that scale armor used

777
03:13:36,040 --> 03:13:48,440
by the black knife assassins forge to make no sound muffles the sound of footsteps interesting

778
03:13:49,159 --> 03:13:53,239
the assassins that carried out the deeds of the night of the black knives were all women

779
03:13:53,239 --> 03:14:06,170
and rumored to be newman who had close ties with america herself really i'm not doing anything

780
03:14:06,170 --> 03:14:30,260
like my hood what about this thing raises dexterity as it lowers focus well it's a good

781
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:51,639
deck summon uh i don't think i can get up all right i gotta keep going around another one of

782
03:14:51,639 --> 03:14:58,840
those bell demons and one of these guys is here weird okay well let's go

783
03:15:02,229 --> 03:15:13,020
hard to tell how much damage is doing but i feel like it's a lot

784
03:15:28,260 --> 03:15:37,209
damn rotten doulas greaves and rotten great axe they're throwing so much equipment at you

785
03:15:41,770 --> 03:15:46,250
bronze snakes eaten through by scarlet rot formed by gladiators who were driven from the coliseum

786
03:15:47,049 --> 03:16:01,100
where it becomes slightly easier to target and where is it rotten axe x it's in scarlet scarlet

787
03:16:01,100 --> 03:16:12,379
rot one of the few items in the game that has scarlet rot build up on the weapon that's actually

788
03:16:12,379 --> 03:16:32,620
seems pretty good moon did 2000 damage to that guy yeah oh no i don't want to do that all right

789
03:16:32,620 --> 03:16:39,899
well there's a bell demon um that looks like a america church so i know i'm gonna do that but

790
03:16:40,940 --> 03:16:43,819
there might be a sacred tier over there so i'm just gonna go get it i'm dead

791
03:16:48,200 --> 03:17:00,600
i didn't think it went down that far i thought that was maybe five feet below where i was

792
03:17:05,049 --> 03:17:21,510
all right whatever it goes did you look go open up any of the red dead redemption two

793
03:17:22,739 --> 03:17:29,659
streams all you need to do is open them up for five seconds if within within 10 minutes if i

794
03:17:29,659 --> 03:17:41,270
don't crash the horse into a rock i i would okay no why am i getting off the horse why can't i

795
03:17:41,829 --> 03:17:50,120
what's happening why can't i use my thing i can't use my spell why why can't i use it why is this

796
03:17:50,120 --> 03:18:06,680
banned this is a banned move oh because my great room fuck i didn't know i had to use one of those

797
03:18:08,819 --> 03:18:44,469
oh that's really bad no yeah all right will this person leave me alone

798
03:19:19,559 --> 03:19:27,459
okay it's time it's time to make the ultimate decision do i get a plus 10 bastard stars

799
03:19:36,329 --> 03:19:48,819
or do i wait to get a plus 10 regal scepter i have i'm i don't know because the issue that i have

800
03:19:48,819 --> 03:19:55,780
with this i feel like in this late game here i've been doing way more sorceries than i were before

801
03:19:59,690 --> 03:20:18,979
like two to three hundred percent more because i don't know you'll get more what do you think

802
03:20:24,389 --> 03:20:31,559
there are a lot of plus 10 stones you're good how accurate is that though like am i going to run

803
03:20:31,559 --> 03:20:44,040
into them soon i could do both okay there's a lot i got i have at least three all right very soon

804
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:57,989
okay all right well then i might as but i might as well make this as best as it can be there's

805
03:20:57,989 --> 03:21:04,389
definitely no reason not to because this is a look at the 179 one that's so much more damage

806
03:21:04,389 --> 03:21:09,979
i'm going for it but let's see what the pole says but i've made my decision what does pole say let

807
03:21:09,979 --> 03:21:23,459
me like this webcam needs to brighten up a little bit i don't know why it's so low that's way too

808
03:21:23,459 --> 03:21:44,120
much that's better there um yeah i'm gonna do it uh it's worth it it's worth it i need it

809
03:21:44,120 --> 03:22:00,649
i'm definitely gonna need it done plus 10 baby rattle it's been done i want to upgrade this

810
03:22:00,649 --> 03:22:06,969
serpent my snake friend so bad to plus like nine or plus 10 where can i get a glove warp five

812
03:22:14,860 --> 03:22:21,670

fire dance thing and it makes us laugh every time and remember sometimes that's all i'm looking for

969
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:48,469
when i get really mad at a boss and i'm like really not having a good time

970
04:05:49,350 --> 04:05:53,739
and i just summon the funny serpent friend that comes out and is like doing this thing

971
04:05:54,620 --> 04:06:01,659
it makes me not mad anymore and it's like this is as fun like that i think that makes me happy

972
04:06:01,659 --> 04:06:18,700
again so like i i haven't been a good time again that alive you want one of the broken summons i

973
04:06:18,700 --> 04:06:23,799
don't i kind of don't want one of the broken summons it's i mean it's cool but these things

974
04:06:23,799 --> 04:06:42,729

975
04:06:42,729 --> 04:07:23,780
it i don't want to die with this many runes everybody have any dialogue no just looking

976
04:07:23,780 --> 04:07:59,319
around just making sure i don't miss anything uh um that's sealed it's a puzzle what do you want

977
04:08:00,200 --> 04:08:09,620
like the four figures in the ever jail any five

978
04:08:09,620 --> 04:08:37,620
i'm gonna level up first i feel like this is gonna be annoying i was gonna kill like one thing

979
04:08:38,340 --> 04:09:03,129
why do you guys have so much fucking health and armor almost like this is the last

980
04:09:03,129 --> 04:09:23,340
was sewn in the game it's more efficient all right give me i'm gone gone gone gone gone gone

981
04:09:23,340 --> 04:09:38,329
gone gone gone i'm sitting at the fire get away from me don't touch me how much intelligence do

982
04:09:38,329 --> 04:10:03,379
i actually have without the rune 63 what the fuck man that sucks you see four i need 68

983
04:10:04,420 --> 04:10:12,780
the rune is five yeah but i don't want to have to rely on the rune to do a cast of spell that i have

984
04:10:13,979 --> 04:10:33,590
all right let's go do this hey content let me check up here first though what does this say

985
04:10:33,590 --> 04:10:47,620
thing held shut by a seal so i'm assuming the seal is going to be this thing this is the oh

986
04:10:47,620 --> 04:10:58,760
turn on light the fire is here in the ever jail your thing oh now everybody's real i get it

987
04:11:02,250 --> 04:11:10,459
all the people we've seen lying around they're now gonna get up i get it that makes sense

988
04:11:11,100 --> 04:11:51,110
all right light the four seals this illusion you can shoot through walls okay you can shoot

989
04:11:51,110 --> 04:12:10,579
straight down you can literally shoot straight down through walls that's not that's fun well now

990
04:12:10,579 --> 04:12:24,229
i'm coming for you motherfucker now i'm coming for you with my swift lint stone maybe just jump can

991
04:12:24,229 --> 04:12:46,120
i use the horse in there i'll just jump up there um so they're on the roofs they're on the roofs

992
04:12:48,569 --> 04:13:18,840
so on each roof i use the horse no no horse allowed there's one right here you can't really

993
04:13:18,840 --> 04:14:05,940
get a lock on this one okay this is one okay um i got there the whole time dude so i'm gonna

994
04:14:05,940 --> 04:14:23,590
just say okay this is not that big so i'm not that concerned but that was a lot why the assassin's

995
04:14:23,590 --> 04:14:31,750
coming for me what did i ever do i know how to fight them though swing in a random direction

996
04:14:31,750 --> 04:14:55,559
until you hit them and just don't stop swinging just going straight down assassin nope that's

997
04:15:00,260 --> 04:15:12,379
i focus just came out of my nose i hope they're not on camera okay imagine getting like attacked

998
04:15:12,379 --> 04:15:17,909
and just saying that saying the thing like the person that's attacking you out loud like i was

999
04:15:17,909 --> 04:15:23,020
calling for help i was making a call out to my teammates that there was a black knife assassin

1000
04:15:23,020 --> 04:15:27,100
right here look at the blip on the mini map look at my blip on the mini map there's a black knife

1001
04:15:27,100 --> 04:15:32,790
assassin right here because even if i died two or three of my teammates would know oh shit all

1002
04:15:32,790 --> 04:15:50,059
right we're going there fuck oh it's you again all right they stay lit somebody said i just have to

1003
04:15:50,059 --> 04:16:04,969

1004
04:16:04,969 --> 04:16:14,090
rattle and like the staff i don't do i really need another two rune arcs no just sprint don't

1005
04:16:14,090 --> 04:16:20,090
stop running and if a black knife assassin shows up just spam l1 over and over again and if you die

1006
04:16:20,090 --> 04:16:48,780
who cares okay go don't don't stop where are they there's one there's that one i got already

1007
04:16:49,340 --> 04:17:22,069
i'm just gonna go in a direction i'm going that way one over here give me the fuck away from me

1008
04:17:22,870 --> 04:18:17,159
how do i how do i get up there to go across there i see him walking into the snow what

1009
04:18:17,639 --> 04:18:43,930
where's his footprints i think i just bumped into him stupid oh my god it's so nerve-wracking

1010
04:18:44,649 --> 04:19:06,600
all right but hold on nothing changes in this dumb ass town i just go into the spirit world

1011
04:19:06,600 --> 04:19:12,700
so let me block out where i need to go so because the architect it's the same architecture

1012
04:19:13,739 --> 04:19:23,770
so i gotta go up there so how do i get from here to there to get okay this has a ladder that goes

1013
04:19:23,770 --> 04:19:31,370
up i got to get up on this roof in particular this one here now what's the way to get up here

1014
04:19:31,370 --> 04:19:54,409
on foot we're here here how do you get up here from the ground the ladder right there

1015
04:19:56,469 --> 04:20:08,299
is there a ladder ladder here how do you get here there okay so it's jump to here jump to there

1016
04:20:09,260 --> 04:20:16,059
and then go up and there's one right there all right let me just let me make sure i can do this

1017
04:20:19,659 --> 04:20:39,909
okay i can make that jump i made that one before as well i made that jump before double check hold

1018
04:20:39,909 --> 04:21:00,569
on what about on this wait maybe that's not a reliable jump what about over here

1019
04:21:02,329 --> 04:21:22,090
and get can i get up here any other easier way but this way maybe okay this is more reliable

1020
04:21:22,090 --> 04:21:34,200
so where is this mark this keep this marked it's right there it's this little spot right here

1021
04:21:34,840 --> 04:21:45,459
right on the edge so climb up there and i have access to the whole roof all right that's what's

1022
04:21:45,459 --> 04:21:58,309
gonna happen good luck trying to fucking remember my like two-year-old object permanence good luck

1023
04:21:58,309 --> 04:22:07,610
remembering where that is even with it's marked on the map in fact it came off it's over there

1024
04:22:08,409 --> 04:22:15,780
why is that so far away what are you talking about why is it so far in the distance oh that's four

1025
04:22:15,780 --> 04:22:30,489
where's one there it is okay so now let's go it's all the same like green and gray building

1026
04:22:31,209 --> 04:22:59,340
okay so from here from here i gotta turn it and just run straight that way right over there

1027
04:23:26,649 --> 04:23:31,129
okay can i can i follow me up the lot he's right there he's literally at the bottom of the ladder

1028
04:23:31,129 --> 04:24:08,389
he's climbing right now he's on the ladder right now right there on the ladder what do i do so is

1029
04:24:08,389 --> 04:24:25,399
they gonna climb the ladder i swear to god i thought i saw footprints it's two so from here

1030
04:24:25,399 --> 04:24:36,299
i can jump around where's the guy with the bow and arrow okay don't even think about it you

1031
04:24:36,299 --> 04:25:04,659
motherfucker don't even think about it where are you dude like okay god no no we're not doing it

1032
04:25:04,659 --> 04:25:44,389
like that oh there's another one shooting at me from another distance away from me

1033
04:25:45,270 --> 04:26:07,110
oh this is not gonna work oh my god i thought that was one oh my goodness just have to run

1034
04:26:07,989 --> 04:26:17,190
you actually just have to run i guess i could cheese somebody said with a bow but i got two

1035
04:26:18,069 --> 04:26:24,229
i just gotta run how are you reliably supposed to get how are you supposed to do that reliably

1036
04:26:24,790 --> 04:26:35,739
that's like a that's yikes how are you supposed to do that okay let's go i feel like with enough to

1037
04:26:35,739 --> 04:26:41,850
just running might be i think it's that's the way to do it run as fast as you can hold the shield

1038
04:26:41,850 --> 04:26:49,209
up if you need to and run and just jump and just pray that you don't get hit you can put on the

1039
04:26:49,209 --> 04:27:07,139
special armor i can use the terrain to block out the shots right for instance like i can just stay

1040
04:27:07,139 --> 04:27:15,620
right here and i won't get hit by anything so where's the route the route is run jump jump

1041
04:27:15,860 --> 04:27:39,479
to that balcony right there jump to that one and around the building go why am i fat rolling

1042
04:27:39,479 --> 04:27:51,620
what's what's going on why am i fat rolling what happened i'm dead he's gonna fucking stab me what

1043
04:27:51,620 --> 04:28:00,500
the fuck man how do i it's a it's a tiny little shield just stab me just kill me already i'm fat

1044
04:28:00,500 --> 04:28:08,840
rolling unbelievable this shield is made out of aluminum foil there's no way that it weighs that

1045
04:28:08,840 --> 04:28:42,899
much this thing is i'm fine relax don't i have a spell that makes it it blocks like a lot of

1046
04:28:42,899 --> 04:28:48,709
damage magic damage or something i wish i could use the fucking moon but i don't have 800

1047
04:28:48,709 --> 04:29:51,879

1081
04:41:59,400 --> 04:42:28,500
i'm sitting down what's going on over here all right at least it's not aggroed silver

1082
04:42:28,500 --> 04:42:59,509
mirror shield friends alive what do i do wait that was that actually a shield field of radiant

1083
04:42:59,509 --> 04:43:06,229
silver astuned with amber and carried by loretta knight of the halid tree shape is said to imitate

1084
04:43:06,229 --> 04:43:12,740
that of a sacred drop of dew which inspired the absurd rumor that loretta herself was an

1085
04:43:13,619 --> 04:43:33,560
alberiniac they're like this is gonna leave oh i didn't do the previous part of the quest

1086
04:43:37,110 --> 04:43:52,419
well and there's no sacred tier here it was a wasted effort okay um i wanted to go down here

1087
04:43:53,299 --> 04:44:02,900
well let's just go look right i want to go see what's over here i hope i don't get trapped over

1088
04:44:02,900 --> 04:44:26,790
here um let's just see what's over here i'm imagine this is probably going to go to the tree

1089
04:44:27,430 --> 04:45:12,500
this could be a huge lore dump incoming killa's halid tree this place fucking sucks why have

1090
04:45:13,060 --> 04:45:17,860
you said that for every single area that's happened the last 10 minutes

1091
04:45:17,860 --> 04:45:22,569
20 minutes each new place i find people say this is the worst place in the game

1092
04:45:23,369 --> 04:45:56,779
this whole game is pain this is gonna be awful because i'm gonna fall off so many times okay

1093
04:45:58,919 --> 04:46:15,639
goal is just to get down the tree so what is this thing what's what why is this here

1094
04:46:15,639 --> 04:46:21,000
because there's the urn tree and then there's this other huge tree it's the halid tree

1095
04:46:23,099 --> 04:46:26,380
somebody gonna explain to me how this works am i gonna like walk in a boss door and they're

1245
05:43:36,009 --> 05:43:52,169

1246
05:43:52,169 --> 05:44:06,540
and do 10 000 every time right that's so stupid that's so okay that's funny all right i can finally

1249
05:44:24,409 --> 05:44:41,110
that much longer i just don't want to fight that later because it's going to be there still okay

1292
06:02:56,500 --> 06:03:21,450
okay that's a huge overhead swing throws like blood at you oh that hurts that's good

1293
06:03:22,250 --> 06:04:46,970
gotta get that down ugly what is that oh god what's this he just he healed he heals at that stage

1294
06:04:46,970 --> 06:04:55,479
okay all right i think i'm gonna save the i'm gonna save serpent use the shackle

1295
06:04:56,040 --> 06:05:05,080
i'm gonna wait to bring serpent in because he looked like he started that was transition to

1296
06:05:05,080 --> 06:05:23,689
phase two hopefully the game didn't crash i feel like it did i think so yes it did okay well

1297
06:05:24,650 --> 06:05:47,029
uh i'll be right back i'm gonna reload the game please don't fuck up my save that's cool though

1298
06:05:47,029 --> 06:05:56,229
that's a cool fight so that's halid tree and i don't know what are they all what are they all

1299
06:05:56,229 --> 06:06:11,159
doing here so i'm what i'm gonna do try to get to phase two bring the serpent out and then

1300
06:06:12,040 --> 06:06:21,099
i'm just imagining you have to run i'm imagining that when he starts to do that thing when he the

1301
06:06:21,099 --> 06:06:32,459
bloody you just have to run the fuck away as far as you can all right yeah we're good let's go you

1302
06:06:32,459 --> 06:06:49,560
see i also could level up my staff to plus 10 which i probably i've read yeah i mean why would

1303
06:06:49,560 --> 06:07:12,439
i not do that this guy this guy's crazy apparently let's do that ancient flask um i think it's fine

1304
06:07:12,439 --> 06:07:24,650
for now this is very important okay here we go sombra ancient dragon smithing stone

1305
06:07:25,529 --> 06:07:39,529
we're at the maximum scaling on this weapon 321 so my moves are gonna be way better now and wait

1306
06:07:39,529 --> 06:07:50,970
didn't i get i need a great grave glove for it i think serpent is the call though i do i thought

1307
06:07:50,970 --> 06:08:06,180
that was gonna be way more expensive i just wasted that run all right uh over here are there any

1308
06:08:06,180 --> 06:08:20,759
romance options um i don't think so let's see if i can get them down to at least like 30 40 percent

1309
06:08:20,759 --> 06:08:43,610
on my own what's that i can send it back down i always forget to do this all right let's go

1310
06:08:44,090 --> 06:08:54,939
let's try it he's gonna send like five moons at him immediately the very beginning

1311
06:08:54,939 --> 06:09:22,419
pretty shit that was fucking incredible slow very slow way slower than i gotta hold on wait

1312
06:09:44,779 --> 06:10:48,500
i'll just do that fucking thing is so slow oh that was dumb i'll never it's gonna take me like

1313
06:10:48,500 --> 06:11:03,380
five more tries to get the like here it comes i'm just trying to get some ingredients do like a

1314
06:11:03,380 --> 06:11:34,869
fucking chunk on him all right watch out get out get out get out get out get out you're gonna do

1315
06:11:34,869 --> 06:11:44,970
the thing what the fuck how far away do you have to be how far away do you have to be

1316
06:11:47,450 --> 06:12:01,080
how far away do you have to be let's just hit you everywhere there's no you can't run from it

1317
06:12:01,080 --> 06:12:08,490
is unlimited range you just have really holy shit okay that well all right okay all right

1318
06:12:11,750 --> 06:12:19,979
use the shackle when he does oh that's a good idea isn't it i have the thing i don't know why

1319
06:12:19,979 --> 06:12:42,180
i'm not using it how many times can i use it all right i also have to first one not hit him

1320
06:13:07,189 --> 06:13:12,090
i i get i gotta take off some of these spells having to go tap tap tap tap tap like five times

1321
06:13:12,090 --> 06:13:27,900
to get the spell i want i gotta get rid of some of these fucking useless ones three hit combo or

1322
06:13:27,900 --> 06:14:40,459
is it a two greed is so real on this some of this shit i'm standing in this goo oh my god that's a

1323
06:14:40,459 --> 06:14:53,430
fucking wall behind me is there yes there is all right i think i gotta i gotta get rid of some of

1324
06:14:53,430 --> 06:15:04,250
these spells i'm never gonna use like star all right like starlight swift glint stone

1325
06:15:04,250 --> 06:15:11,430
zamora's wind store i just want three two spells i don't want to have to be like okay i did my moon

1326
06:15:11,430 --> 06:16:19,139
and now oh there it is okay oh oh got it you oh my god his fucking reach and timing suck

1327
06:16:19,939 --> 06:16:33,450
i gotta give him a phase two before i can even jesus yeah that overhead swing his arm extends

1328
06:16:33,450 --> 06:16:40,090
like five times longer than his arm actually is he stretch armstrongs his arm 50 feet in front of

1329
06:16:40,090 --> 06:16:54,439
him fucking piece of shit i can do two and that's it get two of these right that'll frost him

1330
06:17:01,580 --> 06:17:07,159
it literally did it the last time i did it actually did it the last time i just did it

1331
06:17:07,159 --> 06:18:04,740
why what the fuck happened oh shit don't get greedy all right here he goes here he goes

1332
06:18:05,380 --> 06:18:14,580
so i have to heal through this wait i have a shackle i'm gonna use the shackle let's see what

1333
06:18:14,580 --> 06:19:09,459
works yeah it didn't do anything it didn't do anything oh my god he turned and punched me in the

1334
06:19:09,459 --> 06:19:36,409
face dude dodge the attacks bro do you see what this motherfucker's doing on the screen

1335
06:19:40,340 --> 06:19:48,970
so much of the attacks dude what you really should try to do is dodge the attacks are you

1336
06:19:48,970 --> 06:20:02,360
sure i shouldn't shouldn't fucking run at him and stand still all right he's doing a shit

1337
06:20:02,360 --> 06:20:12,169
load of blood i feel like this guy's really hard i need some more help here what is he's doing like

1338
06:20:12,169 --> 06:20:28,299
blood damage what's like the highest immunity thing in the game is it worth putting this stuff

1339
06:20:28,299 --> 06:20:50,740
on the shackle only works in the first phase what about one of these headshots crits blood loss

1340
06:20:50,740 --> 06:21:09,849
wait what about that i i mean he does fire this is okay this is immunity you shackle while he's

1341
06:21:09,849 --> 06:21:17,380
casting it definitely you'll definitely have a lot of blood loss yeah raise immunity and then i'll

1342
06:21:17,380 --> 06:21:27,080
put on some immunity shit this is okay what about this give me something better like five

1343
06:21:28,119 --> 06:21:46,220
because that's killing me that's doing so much damage all right these are low immunity 44 that's

1344
06:21:46,220 --> 06:22:04,979
heavy load though i gotta be careful 39 44 i don't think i'm gonna see more than 44

1345
06:22:13,259 --> 06:22:24,279
um this is i think a good either way just has a lot read read robustness not immunity for bleed

1346
06:22:24,919 --> 06:22:41,479
oh oh oops all right well that's pretty robust that's robust that's robust that's very robust

1347
06:22:41,479 --> 06:23:06,500
that's what i had on 35 34 39 it's literally the same fucking clothes i just had on

1348
06:23:14,200 --> 06:23:20,549
all right so shackle only works in phase one let's see what it does i just curious what it does

1349
06:23:21,110 --> 06:23:37,369
what's going on all right shackle okay i mean that's how often can i use that

1350
06:23:40,360 --> 06:23:50,119
oh i can use it like a bunch of times in a row holy shit let's do this i use it like

1351
06:23:50,119 --> 06:24:01,400
can i use it you can only do it twice oh it's fire damage too all right i kind of

1352
06:24:01,400 --> 06:24:04,759
fucked this whole thing up didn't i can't do it more than once okay you can only do it twice

1353
06:24:04,759 --> 06:24:17,340
it's is it really even worth doing maybe not honestly i gotta get the timing to be swings

1354
06:24:18,139 --> 06:24:24,229
they're like markets just like sometimes it just takes like an extra second to swing down

1355
06:24:26,569 --> 06:24:32,549
it's actually been a while since i've been fighting an enemy like this yeah it's even longer

1356
06:24:34,069 --> 06:24:43,220
let me just try to get some timings down we're gonna do some practice runs here

1357
06:24:51,060 --> 06:24:53,939
somebody's so quick to fuck you

1358
06:25:13,500 --> 06:25:33,369
all right then he does the fire shit you got it back away from the fire all right there it is

1359
06:25:34,569 --> 06:26:03,110
okay that's a lot faster than than the other one is you throw that far just trying to practice

1360
06:26:03,909 --> 06:26:50,500
okay i got it down something he does three sometimes though he's got do i have to scream

1361
06:26:50,500 --> 06:26:55,700
it from the mountaintops that this is a practice run to learn the mechanics of the fight i'm not

1362
06:26:55,700 --> 06:27:01,939
trying to hurt anybody i'm trying to simply learn the mechanics of the fight gordon mr freeman

1363
06:27:13,560 --> 06:27:26,630
he started with okay is fine there's a whole second phase of different different moves

1364
06:27:27,819 --> 06:27:35,529
i know what look we got we can we got a crawl before we can run i can't i gotta reliably be

1365
06:27:35,529 --> 06:27:42,259
able to get him down to 50 you're the funniest guy on twitch what happened i didn't do anything

1366
06:27:43,220 --> 06:28:05,400
all right first of all i gotta do two moons what happened to them dude please like holding y and

1367
06:28:05,400 --> 06:28:15,430
pressing r1 sucks such ass sometimes god i gotta go to god damn bonfire this is infuriating having

1368
06:28:15,430 --> 06:29:58,360
to do that come on mogwin can i truly hit him during this how fast does he go i got startled

1369
06:29:58,360 --> 06:30:26,169
from the thing it does a second attack the fire on the ground is such poor shit it just makes it

1370
06:30:26,169 --> 06:30:32,680
makes like trying to fight him so much fucking harder he just puts it's just like that little

1371
06:30:32,680 --> 06:30:40,409
fire on the ground where you just like uh uh uh uh that was much better that was actually progress

1372
06:30:41,700 --> 06:30:42,580
oh i'm gonna keep at it

1373
06:31:14,709 --> 06:31:24,180
no i didn't want to do that that fucked the whole thing up that was such a great start too

1374
06:31:26,200 --> 06:31:34,500
i got it don't worry i got it that's a fourth attack sometimes you just don't do that

1375
06:31:34,500 --> 06:31:40,869
you just don't do that sometimes it's always so fucking annoying you don't do that sometimes

1376
06:31:41,509 --> 06:32:00,340
it's a lot weird right now i'm just so mad at this stupid bullshit moves

1377
06:32:42,139 --> 06:32:59,700
boys oh fuck boys so bad i i that was not me fucking around i really wanted to try to get them

1403
06:38:14,259 --> 06:38:19,540
opener though it actually is like the best opener i can do how come i couldn't shackle it i'm so

1406
06:38:35,380 --> 06:38:52,060
that was a good opener i just i expected him to go down and he didn't so i can't do it immediately

1407
06:38:52,060 --> 06:38:55,900
i have to wait till he's done and he's like attacked being hit animation and then do the

1408
06:38:55,900 --> 06:39:08,729
shackle just r1 i that's not gonna happen like that straight up isn't happening i don't do nearly

1435
06:54:12,090 --> 06:54:37,509
like the opportunity to attack is so fucking low like how the fuck am i supposed to close the gap

1436
06:54:37,509 --> 06:54:44,500
on this motherfucker it's so ridiculous it's like by the time you can get in there and attack him

1452
07:01:42,650 --> 07:01:50,119
great lince the spell that goes further that's bigger uh but i feel like this does more damage

1453
07:01:50,200 --> 07:02:01,099
same thing applies let's go again we're going again we're good you can take two hits in the

1454
07:02:01,099 --> 07:02:07,180

1484
07:16:32,409 --> 07:16:42,900
friends list uh all five of the boys just went down to till a little bit lower i've been spending

1485
07:16:42,900 --> 07:16:46,740
way more time with the snake it's not it's like natural to like kind of drift apart from other

1486
07:16:46,740 --> 07:16:54,040
friends right being the snake i've been hanging out a lot and it's like i'll call the boys

1487
07:16:54,040 --> 07:16:59,430
sometimes when i want to hang out but i mean i'm just i've been spending more time with the snake

1488
07:17:01,860 --> 07:17:18,040
oh my god that sucked and that's not even the hard one oh i did this first try i'm not kidding

1489
07:17:18,040 --> 07:17:24,439
you are a god some of those timings are so hard especially when you start bumping into gravestones

1490
07:17:24,439 --> 07:17:31,080
which by the way why are there so many of these up here it's just that all these gravestones

1491
07:17:31,639 --> 07:17:38,459
there's no places to bury anybody why are there so many gravestones it's just like

1492
07:17:40,139 --> 07:18:01,770
they're all your deaths yeah you made that joke two weeks ago you can't make that joke again but

1493
07:18:01,770 --> 07:18:05,529
you said snakes were unpredictable they are that's why they're so good at this fight because

1494
07:18:05,529 --> 07:18:11,770
mogg come on gwen it how he couldn't deal with it how are you supposed to deal with somebody

1495
07:18:11,770 --> 07:18:21,180
that just stands in the corner and goes like this it's weird it's like what you're doing is

1496
07:18:21,259 --> 07:18:28,060
weird so i'm like i'm kind of i'm gonna step back for a second all right uh that's definitely the

1497
07:18:28,060 --> 07:18:35,319
end of the stream by the way like i'm going fucking bad is there anything i can do here

1498
07:18:35,319 --> 07:19:02,069
that was a funny ending well hold on i'm not quite hold on a second i want to go see what that is

1499
07:19:02,709 --> 07:19:09,270

1509
07:21:04,419 --> 07:21:08,819
erupted with fire and he was bestowed with the defilement that he was born into

1510
07:21:09,860 --> 07:21:16,040
frightened of mog lord of blood a sacred spirit that will come to symbolize his dynasty

1511
07:21:16,759 --> 07:21:20,200
as well as serving as a weapon it is an instrument of communion with an outer god

1512
07:21:20,200 --> 07:21:29,849
who bestows power upon a cursed blood mother of truth desires a wound well arcane and strength

1513
07:21:29,849 --> 07:21:42,139
is not this character at all use that instead of the baby rattle i would have to respect the

1514
07:21:42,139 --> 07:22:09,799
entire character respect to use this i don't think so whoa royal knight helm veteran's helm

1515
07:22:10,680 --> 07:22:24,779
anselm veteran's armor royal knight this this is good this is really good

1516
07:22:25,740 --> 07:22:32,659
is that better than what i have on i know that is but this is heavy though that's way too heavy

1517
07:22:32,659 --> 07:22:55,349
i'm not sure i can put that on lord of blood i might just i mean i have enough runes maybe i

1518
07:22:55,349 --> 07:23:01,830
was by this one's 15 what is it okay 16 14 how am i how is this compared to the scale scale armor

1519
07:23:02,389 --> 07:23:10,229
remember the beach hat the beach hat boost cold sorceries i need to use it

1520
07:23:11,830 --> 07:23:16,470

1521
07:23:18,040 --> 07:23:31,349
bye see you later mog it was great but level up probably two more times what's with the stream

1522
07:23:31,349 --> 07:23:45,259
title oh i don't know is a like ipad game joke or something okay let me look at what is it 16 13

1523
07:23:45,259 --> 07:24:15,290
16 16 16 13 so this is better oh all right cool put this on royal knight armor oh that's cool

1524
07:24:18,650 --> 07:24:23,689
i'd lose a lot of resistances but i gained some more physical defense so how does it look

1525
07:24:24,330 --> 07:24:41,419
that looks pretty awesome yeah put it on heavy load royal knight i actually look kind of cool now

1526
07:24:42,380 --> 07:25:06,279
it actually fits it matches pretty cool all right let's do need a little bit more time is it

1527
07:25:06,279 --> 07:25:22,279
midnight what if i just said fuck it and kept going really a little while not that much not

1528
07:25:22,279 --> 07:25:28,650
that much longer just just long enough to all right i won't mind mind and endurance

1529
07:25:29,930 --> 07:25:36,150
i think i can do it again now let's do this lord's rune it's gonna be like 50k

1530
07:25:36,150 --> 07:25:47,930
okay are you gonna scream tomorrow um i don't know it depends on what i do today

1536
07:26:26,700 --> 07:26:35,979
the games are you better believe that i'm i'm coming with some real classics i don't want to

1537
07:26:36,700 --> 07:26:39,979
give it away but i'm telling you right now i think i have a pretty good chance of winning

1538
07:26:40,779 --> 07:26:54,299
very good chance i think all right uh what was i just doing i can put the spells back on because

1539
07:26:54,299 --> 07:27:12,740
i don't i don't i i kind of freaked out here didn't i i want to try this and starlight okay

1541
07:27:24,580 --> 07:27:34,700
dude i got i'm it's me it's it's me uh here we go oh so that's where the so-called lord was

1542
07:27:34,700 --> 07:27:41,819
hiding himself there a fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of

1543
07:27:41,819 --> 07:27:49,000
his precious dynasty while he turns our fellow tarnished into bloody fingers let him stay there

1544
07:27:49,000 --> 07:27:58,580
away his delusions will remain as they are distant and unattainable but perhaps it's worth looking

1545
07:27:58,580 --> 07:28:08,090
into if what i've heard is right then maybe my apologies lost myself for a moment there

1546
07:28:08,729 --> 07:28:16,900
the information you shared is of great value that's promised your reward it is a wondrous

1547
07:28:16,900 --> 07:28:25,099
thing indeed you are a true fellow all i ask is that you remain constant

1548
07:28:27,779 --> 07:28:36,939
you gave me a cookbook fucking cookbook dude i have slayed every demon and every tarnished

1549
07:28:36,939 --> 07:28:42,520
every monster in this whole world and you're gonna give me grandma's meatball recipe is that

1550
07:28:42,520 --> 07:28:49,240
really what you're doing you're gonna show me that how to make fucking lasagna you don't have

1551
07:28:49,240 --> 07:28:53,080
a weapon under there that has a magical fucking juice on it or something that's unbelievable

1552
07:28:54,680 --> 07:29:09,799
a cookbook this better be this better be good where is it it is a wondrous thing indeed okay

1553
07:29:09,799 --> 07:29:34,549
what is it bewitching branch uses fp to charm pierced enemy here's a foe using fp to turn them

1554
07:29:34,549 --> 07:29:54,020
into a temporary ally but actually that is really good well what is it i see so nicola was with the

1555
07:29:54,020 --> 07:30:00,040
lord of blood after all that is some fine intelligence indeed it's pretty high with it

1556
07:30:00,759 --> 07:30:06,650
the far clue has been brought into the light what is it one of the last few pieces the round table

1557
07:30:07,450 --> 07:30:16,090
i need to put everything together as promised allow me to impart to you the last of the secret

1558
07:30:16,090 --> 07:30:30,490
rights normally to me close the door law of causality if he continues his slumber within

1559
07:30:30,490 --> 07:30:39,860
the cocoon it would be safer to destroy it nicola is the one thing that remains a mystery to me

1560
07:30:46,139 --> 07:30:53,340
well there are four more demigods yet to be located uh nicola of the hey i just killed him

1561
07:30:53,340 --> 07:31:00,819
it's twin millennia no i didn't the undefeated lunar princess rani and he has said so here above

1562
07:31:00,819 --> 07:31:11,720
you should learn anything i'll trade you fine oh as such okay so interesting if i go load that

1563
07:31:11,720 --> 07:31:31,560
area what happens to be dead there i need to turn these on right i have a couple that are just not

1564
07:31:31,560 --> 07:31:49,590
on one of them was an atlas right okay this is divine tower of west atlas divine tower of east

1565
07:31:49,590 --> 07:32:19,939
atlas easy enough oh okay already been yeah it's oh more gods okay the hardest boss in any souls

1566
07:32:19,939 --> 07:32:30,340
game i know i know and dude like i don't know hogs great runes so what do you do with this

1567
07:32:30,979 --> 07:32:39,509
grants a blessing of blood to phantoms it's a blessing of blood to summoned phantoms and

1568
07:32:39,509 --> 07:32:46,950
imparts a phantom great rune upon successful invasion hog and margot are twin brothers and

1569
07:32:46,950 --> 07:32:52,860
their great runes are naturally similar the mogs rune is soaked in a cursed blood from his devout

1570
07:32:52,860 --> 07:33:02,099
love for the wretched mire that he was born into what does this do makes you your summons to do

1571
07:33:02,099 --> 07:33:08,580
cool shit when they get kills pvp buff uh okay uh all right let's go to the other one the other one

1572
07:33:08,580 --> 07:33:22,860
was over here what was it west atlas stands upon the precipice at the coast southwest of lendell

1573
07:33:23,419 --> 07:33:50,790
that's right here okay how do i get there you go through the cave in here what is this

1574
07:33:51,830 --> 07:33:57,740
it should be a church okay i have a question for everybody that's played through this game and that

1575
07:33:57,740 --> 07:34:16,970
has knows everything about it if i cannot i can't go this way um if i go to that mountaintop where

1576
07:34:16,970 --> 07:34:23,220
the giants are and i go to that big scary thing am i going to lock myself out of doing anything

1577
07:34:23,220 --> 07:34:52,900
else oh okay what about no okay no you have to you lock yourself out of an ending you lock yourself

1578
07:34:52,900 --> 07:34:57,380
out getting some items that's okay i don't think i care i'm at this point i'm pretty locked in

1579
07:35:09,580 --> 07:35:19,659
not major you don't lock yourself out okay all right well let's i want to see it i want to know

1580
07:35:19,659 --> 07:35:26,569
what happens do we need to go i need to go this way probably better to do this

1581
07:35:27,529 --> 07:35:41,930
yeah i'm not gonna do everything that's possible i have second third fourth fifth playthroughs

1582
07:35:41,930 --> 07:35:46,729
eventually do that i'll do on my own and i encourage you to do different things too

1583
07:35:48,200 --> 07:35:59,080
because the game obviously is supposed to be played through a magnitude of times the area

1584
07:35:59,159 --> 07:36:14,099
after that that you get locked out of okay i did not come here minor urtree church

1585
07:36:16,229 --> 07:36:19,909
that would have been nice if i had had this because this is definitely a sacred tier

1586
07:36:22,229 --> 07:36:30,020
it's not a sacred tier what the hell is it golden order seal like a faith weapon

1587
07:36:30,020 --> 07:36:40,069
i look like a faith weapon yeah it is boost fundamentalist incantations fundamentalism

1588
07:36:40,069 --> 07:36:55,299
okay cool well how would you rate this game i really don't even know it's r2

1589
07:36:58,419 --> 07:37:13,369
okay i think it's probably the new standard for what people would consider like a great

1590
07:37:14,490 --> 07:37:21,340
unbelievable video game i think it'll probably end up being the standard if not a standard of

1591
07:37:21,340 --> 07:37:37,349
like video game it's not perfect i don't think by any means uh but it's pretty damn it's pretty

1592
07:37:37,349 --> 07:37:51,080
damn close i would say it's probably yeah i would say it's probably the game of the decade

1593
07:37:52,950 --> 07:37:57,830
it's sort of a culmination of okay well it has a thing if you don't like from software games

1594
07:37:59,099 --> 07:38:07,659
and you're gonna be like dude you're an idiot like this game's not as good as um skyrim but i mean

1595
07:38:07,659 --> 07:38:22,790
hold on it's gonna come back and go wrap around get off the horse i didn't i want to do so much

1596
07:38:22,790 --> 07:38:33,590
sooner than that i'm brain is just slow just tired here okay there have been times in this

1597
07:38:33,590 --> 07:38:42,279
game where i looked around and said it is too much to do i'm standing right here there's times i've

1598
07:38:42,279 --> 07:38:46,200
opened the map and i'm going like there's way too much to do i don't even know what to do

1599
07:38:49,830 --> 07:38:57,419
so when you get to that stage where each area and each place you're going to is so overwhelmingly

1600
07:38:57,500 --> 07:39:03,159
large with stuff to look at and stuff to do i mean there's no i don't i can't think of

1601
07:39:03,159 --> 07:39:09,400
a game that did that to me in the last 10 years where i was actually truly overwhelmed by the

1602
07:39:09,400 --> 07:39:16,599
video game truly like i don't know about this this is kind of this is so inspiring i don't

1603
07:39:16,599 --> 07:39:22,439
know what to do where do i go look at the tree there's a tree over there it's been an incredibly

1604
07:39:22,439 --> 07:39:36,860
long time am i not gonna be able to hurt this last time i had that feelings when i played dark

1605
07:39:36,860 --> 07:39:44,330
souls for the first time yeah but i this is better than dark souls i know people probably

1606
07:39:44,330 --> 07:39:50,250
gonna be mad at me for that i think but it is just isn't i'm so bad at this i can't even

1607
07:39:50,250 --> 07:39:56,619
comprehend why i'm doing this so poorly but it's it's unfair to say that because this is

1608
07:39:56,619 --> 07:40:23,779
this is just dark souls 5.0 did it leave the thing fucking left oh here it is

1609
07:40:24,580 --> 07:40:43,020
very full strike okay cool um because everybody needs to please be honest please be honest with

1610
07:40:43,020 --> 07:40:50,630
yourselves and with me and i'll be honest too this is this is just this is dark souls like it's just

1611
07:40:50,630 --> 07:40:57,349
the game is the video game not the world not the pieces not the individual parts the video game

1612
07:40:57,349 --> 07:41:04,700
here is dark souls it's just dark souls it's that's just what it is there is almost no difference to

1613
07:41:04,700 --> 07:41:09,580
how this plays to dark souls they're the almost the exact same video game so saying that like

1614
07:41:09,580 --> 07:41:12,700
dark souls 1 is better is kind of hard because or dark souls 3 or whatever is

1615
07:41:13,979 --> 07:41:23,819
they just made a better version here it is at least in my opinion right because

1616
07:41:23,819 --> 07:41:28,139
secura was a lot different even though it had the same kind of similar themes and stuff it was a

1617
07:41:28,139 --> 07:41:35,909
wildly different game i feel like i'm playing dark souls 3 right now like kind of like a better

1618
07:41:35,909 --> 07:42:02,900
version of it in a way illusion wall over here right here please destroy that baldkins blessing

1619
07:42:03,700 --> 07:42:16,869
do i have i don't have i don't have a blessing i don't have a baldkins blessing how does this

1620
07:42:16,869 --> 07:42:25,930
compare to half-life alex they're both like kind of huge huge like generational leaps of video

1621
07:42:25,930 --> 07:42:34,069
games for me because this is almost everything i wanted dark souls to be i loved playing dark

1622
07:42:34,069 --> 07:42:40,310
souls 3 i love bloodborne i loved i didn't love the hero but you know let's just say it we'll

1623
07:42:40,310 --> 07:42:43,909
just say because it's the whole family and we can't just say we don't love a certain family members

1624
07:42:44,869 --> 07:42:51,080
uh but what was it what was it going where was it what was it just saying like a one second ago

1625
07:42:51,639 --> 07:42:56,139
before that what was the last thing that i just said i actually fucking don't remember

1626
07:43:01,209 --> 07:43:12,709
what did i say half-life okay okay okay okay half-life alex is also kind of one of those games

1627
07:43:12,709 --> 07:43:20,810
that is just like a generational game that's the best version of vr games that exist because most

1628
07:43:20,810 --> 07:43:28,950
vr games don't do it very well i still think this is better i think this is better than alex

1629
07:43:30,069 --> 07:43:39,619
because it's more the type of game that i like to play i love upgrades i love character progression

1630
07:43:40,259 --> 07:43:44,099
i like real character progression not fake horse shit character progression

1631
07:43:44,740 --> 07:43:51,540
where your character's moves are not hidden behind a skill tree i don't like arbitrary dumb

1632
07:43:51,540 --> 07:44:00,360
stupid shitty skill trees i like real character progression item progression tons of it i like

1633
07:44:00,360 --> 07:44:06,680
when games don't kind of i like when you have to kind of figure stuff out like asking you guys how

1634
07:44:06,680 --> 07:44:15,139
to kill bog uh this is a game that i like more than a game that i like i like this more than

1635
07:44:15,139 --> 07:44:27,610
i like vr games let's put it that way and the here's the worst part about okay the worst part

1636
07:44:27,610 --> 07:44:32,599
about being a big fan of games like this is realistically there's really only one company

1637
07:44:32,599 --> 07:44:40,869
that makes it it's like the it's this fine wine that is so delicious and so wonderful that you're

1638
07:44:40,869 --> 07:44:44,709
like holy shit when they're done when i hope they don't go out of business for any reason

1639
07:44:44,709 --> 07:44:48,150
because that's my favorite wine and i'm never going to get it anywhere else then no one will

1640
07:44:48,150 --> 07:44:54,819
ever get the same flavor ever again people have tried right people make souls like games but

1641
07:44:54,819 --> 07:45:01,369
they're not even close they're not even close some of them have come kind of close have been

1642
07:45:01,369 --> 07:45:09,139
hold on there are some that have come kind of close they're they're fun they're interesting

1643
07:45:09,139 --> 07:45:22,279
but i just they just don't do it the same way for me and for all the things that i would say about

1644
07:45:22,279 --> 07:45:38,310
this game for all the things that i could say nobody really does it the same way every time

1645
07:45:38,310 --> 07:45:57,400
i've played one what was the point of doing that there's nothing there oh it was a stone

1646
07:45:59,029 --> 07:46:09,830
oh what kind of stone yeah fucking me strong we'll get it kind of want to try this

1647
07:46:15,319 --> 07:46:20,520
oh yeah when you see in golden ruin fives i can buy that thing in the store for probably a thousand

1648
07:46:20,520 --> 07:46:35,419
souls i don't really need it yeah nobody quite nobody quite doesn't like this and i know it's

1649
07:46:35,419 --> 07:46:39,580
it feels kind of bad in a way because like i i didn't like secure as much as i liked

1650
07:46:40,540 --> 07:46:47,799
like dark i like dark souls 3 i like bloodborne i the reason why i like dark souls 3

1651
07:46:47,799 --> 07:46:51,400
more than any of the other ones besides bloodborne i can't i bloodborne's like in

1652
07:46:51,400 --> 07:46:58,680
a grayed out area up here because 30 fps ps4 only but it's like one of my favorite games ever

1653
07:46:59,639 --> 07:47:09,220
but dark souls 3 the engine the 60 fps the animations are so much better the dark souls

1654
07:47:09,220 --> 07:47:13,779
one remaster it wasn't like didn't do it as much i wish that it was more like the demon souls

1655
07:47:14,740 --> 07:47:25,369
which i haven't played so what just happened died dark souls 2 copium

1656
07:47:28,299 --> 07:47:32,139
the newer animation style and the newer engine they started using since bloodborne

1657
07:47:32,700 --> 07:47:36,939
i find those games to be more fun to play i don't necessarily think that they are

1658
07:47:38,069 --> 07:47:42,869
wildly better video games i just think that they're more fun to physically play because

1659
07:47:42,869 --> 07:47:51,299
the engine is just better it's cleaner it's more fast paced it's there's more going on yeah

1660
07:47:53,349 --> 07:48:00,150
if you gave the dark souls 3 like demon souls engine to dark souls 1 we would have a different

1661
07:48:00,150 --> 07:48:21,349
conversation we're not having that conversation right now though it's a wall oh give me that

1662
07:48:25,779 --> 07:48:39,299
uh what a good time to get killed i want to do it let me do it the worst enemy probably

1663
07:48:39,299 --> 07:49:09,080
to test this on but whatever oh bounces everywhere you piece of shit really thank you for killing

1664
07:49:09,560 --> 07:49:36,819
dark souls 2 is bad dark souls 2 is not bad it's just messy dark souls 2 is not a bad game it's

1665
07:49:36,819 --> 07:49:56,569
just a mess and i had fun with dark souls 2 i didn't stream dark souls 2 but i played it i

1666
07:49:56,569 --> 07:50:04,810
beat it i did when they did the weird let's kind of just go into gmod and place enemies in random

1667
07:50:04,810 --> 07:50:13,240
places dlc expansion fucking whatever the hell that was um i played that it was all right

1668
07:50:13,959 --> 07:50:21,290
i thought it was fun i didn't hate it i liked how much there was to do in dark souls 2

1669
07:50:21,930 --> 07:50:32,389
and add good dlc yeah i did dark souls 3's dlc was really good as well i think dark souls 3 might

1670
07:50:32,389 --> 07:50:38,279
have dark souls 3 and bloodborne might be the best dlc of any of the from software games so far

1671
07:50:48,250 --> 07:50:54,680
are you still live i guess we're just going yeah bloodborne's dlc is number one and then

1672
07:50:54,680 --> 07:51:05,750
dark souls 3's dark souls 3's dlc is number two you like dark souls 2 i don't i don't hate dark

1673
07:51:05,750 --> 07:51:16,119
souls 2 i just don't think it's it's not my favorite dark souls 2 and sakiro sit down at

1674
07:51:16,119 --> 07:51:21,830
the same place for me sort of dark souls 1 i have to be honest i know a ton of people are like dude

1675
07:51:21,830 --> 07:51:26,389
how could you how could you say that dark souls 1 belongs down there it don't it doesn't belong

1676
07:51:26,389 --> 07:51:40,659
down there it is i mean you i you watched me play through all of sakiro i did the whole thing on

1677
07:51:40,659 --> 07:51:53,990
stream i did that's probably the maddest i've ever been in a video game on camera ever i feel

1678
07:51:53,990 --> 07:51:58,389
like i'm remembering only the bad parts of me getting mad at sakiro and not all the good parts

1679
07:51:58,389 --> 07:52:11,740
of me having a great time right this place is insane by the way sakiro is better than elden ring

1680
07:52:12,540 --> 07:52:16,790
no i just think it's the they just combined all their video games into one game and it's

1681
07:52:16,790 --> 07:52:26,580
just the best version of all of them now hold on though i am a big fan of a lot of content

1682
07:52:27,139 --> 07:52:31,220
right so i might actually going back and playing dark souls 2 i might have a different opinion

1683
07:52:32,500 --> 07:52:39,860
uh i've heard the complaints of this game of well when there's okay he's gonna explode

1684
07:52:44,180 --> 07:52:51,139
when there's so much to do and you level up it's very easy to kind of miss whole areas because the

1685
07:52:51,139 --> 07:52:56,340
character is too strong and you go back and it's like oh i guess i just kind of missed this entire

1686
07:52:56,340 --> 07:53:03,340
thing but i just like it's like i kill everything in one hit and it's kind of not fun right i

1687
07:53:03,340 --> 07:53:10,900
understand that aspect my only rebuttal would be just don't do it do it on a different character

1688
07:53:10,900 --> 07:53:14,419
and just keep going and progressive just do beat it and come back and do the other stuff you didn't

1689
07:53:14,419 --> 07:53:32,540
do what happened i have a feeling i'm why am i so scared of this thing i have a feeling i'm

1690
07:53:32,540 --> 07:53:46,520
going to kill it prime example coming up right here like i could probably just let this guy

1691
07:53:46,520 --> 07:53:55,049
hit me over and over again i could just probably spam r1 so like for instance that was that was

1692
07:53:55,049 --> 07:54:02,759
incredibly simple that was very easy right if i had come here 45 levels ago that might have been

1693
07:54:02,759 --> 07:54:07,000
like oh shit this is a this is a tough encounter i'm dodging i gotta watch out i just literally

1694
07:54:07,000 --> 07:54:15,880
slept through that um so that's what i mean by that i'm coming back and doing all this other

1695
07:54:15,880 --> 07:54:21,500
content that i didn't do yeah you know i don't have to be doing this right but when you have

1696
07:54:21,500 --> 07:54:29,939
such a huge world and um you level up a lot you're going to be way stronger than content you didn't

1697
07:54:29,939 --> 07:54:39,849
get to see that's the fun of it though you can come back and just wipe the floor with everything

1698
07:54:41,259 --> 07:54:47,259
no no it is it really is but sometimes you can feel like a few days ago maybe like a week ago

1699
07:54:47,259 --> 07:54:54,619
when i was streaming this i did an area that i had maybe was a week or two ago i did an area

1700
07:54:55,419 --> 07:54:59,900
that it was clearly like i was just wiping the fucking floor with everything it was not even

1701
07:54:59,900 --> 07:55:02,939
a challenge i was just walking through the area and just like hitting r1 and killing everything

1702
07:55:03,909 --> 07:55:13,529
um and that was like all right that's kind of cool it makes me want it makes me want to like

1703
07:55:13,529 --> 07:55:16,889
make a new character and just go do that and just turn around and go the other direction

1704
07:55:19,380 --> 07:55:23,619
like if i kill something in one hit and like i get surrounded by five enemies and i just go

1705
07:55:23,619 --> 07:55:28,389
like this all five of them die i'm just like all right i'm gonna come back here in another

1706
07:55:28,389 --> 07:55:38,500
character and i'm gonna see this content and i'm gonna see it well sometimes you want to

1707
07:55:38,500 --> 07:55:49,619
break from getting your head kicked in yeah no it is it's true and that's not even a complaint

1708
07:55:49,619 --> 07:55:54,069
that's just kind of i've seen a lot of people say that they're way under leveled for certain

1709
07:55:54,069 --> 07:55:59,110
places and way over leveled for certain places and when a game doesn't really tell you what to do

1710
07:55:59,669 --> 07:56:03,669
you can end up in scenarios where you're in one area when you're not supposed to be

1711
07:56:03,669 --> 07:56:10,220
way lower and then the next area you go to you're way higher um i've seen that happen a few times

1712
07:56:10,860 --> 07:56:17,689
that's unavoidable yeah oh yeah because there's no the game doesn't tell you where to go

1713
07:56:18,250 --> 07:56:21,689
but that's part of the reason why the game is so fun because you know the game's not like oh you

1714
07:56:21,689 --> 07:56:25,689
see that over there go there next by the way you this is all walled off you can't do anything

1715
07:56:25,689 --> 07:56:45,639
else why is the character such a fat ass because i have big armor on how many more of these things

1716
07:56:45,639 --> 07:56:59,639
exist stores hp upon defeating enemies it's good for like leveling better than auto scale yeah

1717
07:56:59,639 --> 07:57:06,729
scaling enemies is always a thing no i don't like that either i think they did a pretty good job

1718
07:57:06,729 --> 07:57:14,549
here i really do but it is a problem like this problem's for eat both things that's cool okay

1719
07:57:14,549 --> 07:57:23,000
i destroyed a lot of oblivion's fun yeah enemies that scale just kind of like you never feel like

1720
07:57:23,000 --> 07:57:26,680
you're making any real progress because you're just doing the exact same what was the point of

1721
07:57:26,680 --> 07:57:30,840
leveling up what's the point of having like a level system right there's no there's actually

1722
07:57:30,840 --> 07:57:36,439
no reason for it you just you're doing the same thing you're getting hurt and you're doing the

1723
07:57:36,439 --> 07:57:44,169
same amount of damage the whole game so it's actually really difficult to do a game that does

1724
07:57:44,250 --> 07:57:54,229
not scale that has this much content to do this is not this is an absurd amount of shit to do

1725
07:57:54,229 --> 07:58:00,220
so i feel like it's been pretty good so far and we're at the end of the game so you know all right

1726
07:58:00,220 --> 07:58:10,520
i got all the runes or at least the ones that i have in my inventory so before i turn off the

1727
07:58:10,520 --> 07:58:34,779
stream i think i want to see what's going on in this see this i want to know more guidance would

1728
07:58:34,779 --> 07:58:44,819
be better um if i'm honest um maybe but when you open the doors to limb grave for the first time

1729
07:58:46,150 --> 07:58:50,939
and you know when that i remember i think on stream i even said it i was sitting there going

1730
07:58:50,939 --> 07:59:00,500
holy shit when you understand that there you just are just go do something it's not a bunch of

1731
07:59:00,500 --> 07:59:05,500
indicators on the screen there's not a bunch of things telling you where to go it it hits a lot

1732
07:59:05,500 --> 07:59:12,740
different you get to experience it however you want and you know that the game has been crafted

1733
07:59:12,740 --> 07:59:18,630
to make sure that there's experiences in every single direction the grace light yeah but i mean

1734
07:59:18,630 --> 07:59:24,330
the grace light tip i'll be honest this is it's not this doesn't really tell you fucking anything

1735
07:59:25,500 --> 07:59:30,779
like there were times where i would go here like especially like i like oh uh where do i want to go

1736
07:59:31,580 --> 07:59:37,180
i guess down down where like there's something here did you want to show me this did you want

1737
07:59:37,180 --> 07:59:44,810
to show me that was it this that you were pointing to was it this it's not a great indicator or oh

1738
07:59:44,810 --> 07:59:55,319
my god don't fall off but yeah if you walk in that direction you will find something to do

1739
08:00:00,279 --> 08:00:03,000
just pick my fucking boogies out of my goddamn disgusting ass nose

1740
08:00:05,639 --> 08:00:28,729
at least i don't have to lose anything long-winded rant you asked what do i think of the game

1741
08:00:29,770 --> 08:00:35,209
i really it's been like a month i've been playing this game on stream for almost a full month over

1742
08:00:35,209 --> 08:00:43,159
a month i i do think it's probably one of the best games ever played without a doubt i have

1743
08:00:43,159 --> 08:00:48,970
some issues with it obviously you've heard the complaints but it is definitely one of the best

1744
08:00:48,970 --> 08:01:07,880
games to come out in the last 10 years at least at least gorge of the giants if we didn't have

1745
08:01:07,880 --> 08:01:13,830
gravestones it'd be a 10 out of 10 can i survive this no i gotta go like here

1746
08:01:20,090 --> 08:01:49,209
so what am i supposed to do with this thing so i'll walk around so this is interesting this is a

1747
08:01:49,209 --> 08:02:10,779
gigantic giant furnace what is why is this here it's also really cool because the game tricks you

1748
08:02:10,779 --> 08:02:19,580
a lot into pretending that it's way smaller than it is opening up the map in the first like 10

1749
08:02:19,580 --> 08:02:23,819
hours of the game and you only get this much to look at and even if you try to zoom out you're

1750
08:02:23,819 --> 08:02:37,060
stuck like here it's it's insane your brain cannot comprehend that was crazy every time a new fog of

1751
08:02:37,060 --> 08:02:42,740
war kind of was added to at the top left at the top right or whatever when i first opened up the

1752
08:02:42,740 --> 08:02:47,139
limb grid map i was like all right this doesn't really seem that big but i guess there's probably

1753
08:02:47,139 --> 08:02:56,490
a lot of content here right did not understand how big it was that was one of the coolest parts of

1754
08:02:56,490 --> 08:03:02,650
the game so far because they're kind of teasing how big their game actually was and of course

1755
08:03:02,650 --> 08:03:09,209
they're gonna flex let them they're like oh you think it's that big no take a look let them flex

1756
08:03:09,209 --> 08:03:30,139
let them i talk at this yeah i can talk okay here we go what are we doing i have long observed the

1757
08:03:30,139 --> 08:03:39,990
lands between this world is in dire need of repair and death indiscriminate are you prepared

1758
08:03:40,709 --> 08:03:52,619
to commit a cardinal sin i'd like you to wait i would like for you to wait that's that's like a

why are you still gone

1838
08:32:33,060 --> 08:32:40,020

1839
08:32:40,020 --> 08:32:53,610
come back oh why are you still gone what's wrong with you what are you doing take a look around

1840
08:32:54,169 --> 08:33:05,770
table holders burned raised to the ground is this in the urd tree i don't blame you spirit tuning

1841
08:33:05,770 --> 08:33:12,490
just the same as before which is why i need your help persuading master hugh to leave i did this

1842
08:33:12,490 --> 08:33:19,819
his roots are so knotted in this place he was much longer if he stays here his shackles have

1843
08:33:19,819 --> 08:33:25,900
broken he's a free man now it's high time you put the round table behind him

1844
08:33:26,700 --> 08:33:48,150
oh you great great glove wart god damn it before you leave i knew you'd be back out your arms

1845
08:33:49,830 --> 08:33:54,069
why are you still doing this weren't you listening as i've always said

1846
08:33:54,709 --> 08:34:01,750
are you going to challenge the demigods and their god to slay them and as long as you do i will

1847
08:34:01,750 --> 08:34:09,430
always smith your weapons it is what i wish to smith a weapon for you to slay a god

1848
08:34:18,790 --> 08:35:14,459
all right roger the letter letter written in a trembling hand i forgot to tell you but it seems

1849
08:35:14,459 --> 08:35:20,520
d has a younger brother i heard he lies in a deep sleep in the aqueduct beside the eternal city of

1850
08:35:20,520 --> 08:35:27,750
nocron and said he stood before the prince of death not far beyond that spot roger there are

1851
08:35:27,750 --> 08:35:45,189
trees on fire um sorry i couldn't he's been dead for weeks have i just knocked on out

1852
08:35:45,189 --> 08:35:53,900
there and turned right he's been sitting there just rotting for a month he helped us he gave

1853
08:35:53,900 --> 08:36:12,250
us his thing all right dude i did it you burn table is soon to all serve to be needed to burn

1854
08:36:12,250 --> 08:36:24,389
for that i'll stay at the round table for a time i must learn all that can be taken from this place

1855
08:36:25,110 --> 08:36:30,709
and seal it into my memory how could i call myself the all knowing if i did any less

1856
08:36:31,509 --> 08:36:37,959
the pursuit of knowledge is without end for knowledge is never a thing complete

1857
08:36:38,599 --> 08:36:43,959
thus i maintain the mantle of all knowing you know everything perhaps the same could be said

1858
08:36:43,959 --> 08:36:51,240
of guidance it is to say whether we'll remain who we are once the fight is finished what do you think

1859
08:36:51,959 --> 08:36:54,810
as one of the spires to become elden lord

1860
08:37:00,069 --> 08:37:14,250
okay can i walk into the urn tree now no don't no no no

1861
08:37:17,450 --> 08:37:26,250
you're here for some spirit tuning so master hugue won't listen to you either you have my

1862
08:37:26,250 --> 08:37:32,860
thanks regardless i'll try and talk him around next time i know he was given this great entreaty

1863
08:37:33,419 --> 08:37:41,319
to craft a weapon which could slay of god but think of it as a curse a fearsome curse

1864
08:37:42,279 --> 08:37:49,459
that's the case i'm not sure there's anything we can do

1865
08:37:54,119 --> 08:38:13,509
i got some bells though when i hand them in the dung eater just still hanging out

1866
08:38:14,310 --> 08:38:23,299

08:38:23,299 --> 08:38:40,439
four all right wow you really can do this great okay i need some great brave glove warts

1868
08:38:44,119 --> 08:38:54,229
uh it looks like we're gonna have to go another day pretty cool we're gonna have to do this

1869
08:38:54,229 --> 08:38:59,979
another time there's still some stuff left to do before what i imagine is i can walk into the urn

1870
08:38:59,979 --> 08:39:03,240
tree now we're not going to immediately do that

1871

1872
08:39:22,759 --> 08:39:31,700

1873
08:39:32,500 --> 08:39:42,009
