1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,619
I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna shoot you in the back of the head.

2
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:18,789
You talking to me? Why did you turn around and start shooting me? I was like, just kidding.

3
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,420
I shot one time, it was a warning shot. Yeah, but your gun was like pointed at my face.

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,420
Yeah, and warning. Alright. Alright, wait. Let's go pick up Boo. Let's go ba-

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,420
What just happened? Oh, that's how you detonate C4.

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,780
Oh my god, are you serious, dude?

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,340
I did like a cartwheel. Oh, I hit the cop car.

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Hey, hey, let's do it. Get in the car. Alright.

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,340
Setting the perfect trap for these two. Oh my god, this is a two-wheel, a two-passenger seat.

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,340
This is a two-person car, are you serious? Oh, Boo, sorry.

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,859
This is what you get.

12
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,859
Oh, you threw that over there, okay. Oh my god.

13
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,349
You deserve that stealth. Yeah. Stealth? What do I know?

14
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:15,349
Following over this to this cab car, let's do this. I forget what button you press.

15
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:19,909
I don't know how to get up. Oh god, it's-

16
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,909
It's left shift, it's left shift, okay. What the hell just happened?

17
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:34,739
I just scraped the building.

18
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,049
I just did a two- Oh no, I'm falling.

19
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,049
Dude, I just scraped the building. That was ridiculous.

20
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,530
Oh my god. There's a helicopter after me, you know.

21
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,769
If you look very far down. Actually, no, it's that one that's like half blown if you look down there.

22
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:56,140
Hey, stop it. Alright, ready, we're gonna come over here.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,890
We're jumping off this side and we're all gonna- it's left shift to open the parachute.

24
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,329
You ready, guys? Let's do it. Oh baby.

25
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,699
Oh yeah. We're the three parachuting friends.

26
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,139
Oh, you can detach it with F. Oh shit.

27
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:21,770
Dude, I'm just still floating around. You hold down S to like not die.

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,189
S? And then you- like W-A-S-D?

29
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:32,310
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, guys, I forgot how to use my parachute.

30
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,699
I forgot how to use my parachute! What? How did you kill me?

31
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,379
I have nowhere near you.

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,259
Oh dear. Oh, you busted like a cap in me apparently.

33
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:51,259
You guys keep killing each other.

34
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:55,259
I plowed him.

35
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,949
Well, it worked as a new chopper. Dude, I feel like the Human Torch or something, like really like-

36
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:07,050
I really felt like the Human Torch right there.

37
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,460
Oh gosh. Where are you? Oh hey, look who's like following me right now, shooting like missiles at me.

38
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Have you just been my parachuting all this time? Are you hitting the-

39
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,990
Are you hitting me right now? I think so. Alright, there's the land.

40
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,620
How did I die? I'll take your car, buddy.

41
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,979
It's like an M249 sword. Alright, let's do it.

42
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,669
I have four stars, I'm afraid. You do? Oh, you're back there. Alright, I'm coming to you.

43
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,090
Oh, will you get away from me? Oh my god.

44
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,090
What? What is going on? All the cops that were coming after you are like-

45
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,090
Oh my god, get me away! It's like an enemy helicopter.

46
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,090
Oh my god, dude. Oh my god.

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,710
What? Are you serious?

48
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,710
Why are there so many? Why are there so-

49
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,789
Why are they killing you?

50
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:16,790
Every cop in the city just came after me, like they just were all pulling up at the same time.

51
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,790
Why are there so many?

52
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,160
Why are there so-

53
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,850
Why are they killing you?

54
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,019
We're going to the other side. We're going to go this way, it's a little bit more of a longer drive.

55
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,019
I'm going to go off the edge!

56
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,199
The cops are coming, wait there.

57
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:49,100
Oh shit.

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,620
What are you doing?

59
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,370
What are you doing? We're trying to do

60
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,959
insane stunts.

61
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,959
So I lost the helicopter.

62
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,259
There's another one here, it's okay. How are you doing?

63
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:19,139
I'm so tempted to shoot this guy. No, don't do it, don't do it.

64
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,639
We're going to see if we get the cops on us for doing this.

65
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,420
He's like- Not yet, not yet, hold on.

66
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,060
Oh jeez.

67
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,300
I can't believe we don't have any stars.

68
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,540
He doesn't even get to testify pointing my gun at him.

69
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:51,639
It's the worst cop ever.

70
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,639
You are legitimately pointing your gun at his face.

71
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:02,230
Sorry officer.

72
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:12,019
Sorry officer.

73
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:22,439
Sorry officer.

74
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:32,170
Sorry officer.

75
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,170
I'm just going to go off the ground before I shoot.

76
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,600
There we go.

77
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,060
I know he's still alive, what a beast.

78
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,060
I'm like holding it upside down like this.

79
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Your back was breaking to do it.

80
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,259
I'm laughing at that.

81
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,259
No, don't go over the edge!

82
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,500
When you see us getting close, do it.

83
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,439
Do it.

84
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,060
That's why we have to turn friendly fire off, so it doesn't kill us.

85
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,029
Oh my god.
