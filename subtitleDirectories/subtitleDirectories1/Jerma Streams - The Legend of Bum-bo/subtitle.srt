1
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,979
It's popped over, I see. Roy Mustang, S tier, or Riot.

2
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,200
Do you think you're on the VOD?

3
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,960
Oh shit, I thought I was watching the VOD. He went live right when that happened.

4
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,239
So the chat turned into the live chat.

5
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,659
A new tier list. Binding of Isaac bosses. Binding of Isaac items.

6
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:27,930
No, no more tier lists. Sounds like a pretty good list though. It doesn't already exist.

7
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:32,599
That would take so long. Yeah, there wasn't like a thousand items in Binding of Isaac.

8
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,209
But speaking of Binding of Isaac, what a perfect transition to talk about what we're doing today.

9
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,609
We are going to, I was going to do this yesterday, but we spent a little more time in

10
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:57,989
Katamari than I would have imagined. And then we did tier lists. So this got bumped over to today.

11
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:05,620
We are going to play the Legend of Bumbo, which is the Binding of Isaac prequel,

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,210
but it's a different game. These are different games. If you think you're going to get that

13
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:17,770
classic Binding of Isaac gameplay, it's a little different. This is a cardboard

14
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:29,030
attack and defend match for video game. It's Edmund McMillan. Same guy. I trust it'll be a

15
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:43,050
fun experience. And everything's made out of cardboard. So this stream, I don't know how

16
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,330
long the stream is going to be. It might be a few hours. It might be seven, eight. Like, I don't

17
00:02:50,330 --> 00:03:00,840
know. I might get really into this. I might think this is a lot of fun. I don't know. Incoming 30

18
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,979
minutes. I think it probably takes like 30 minutes to get through the tutorial. So I doubt that. But

19
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:15,210
something else to talk about very quickly before we move on with this. I just preliminarily started

20
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,729
to really start to put the resources in and truly develop the fuck the King streams.

21
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,219
They're going to be way more elaborate than I think anybody thinks. We're talking multiple

22
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:38,280
camera angles. We're talking about multiple observer views. The King streams are now actively

23
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:48,860
being started now. No spoilers. You're going to have to know how this works though, as we get closer

24
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:56,919
because there's, you guys need to participate in this stream. I can't just be like two days

25
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,039
before the stream starts and go, oh, hey, by the way, here's the server info.

26
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,520
No, this is going to be all kinds of systems that need to be talked about beforehand.

27
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:14,599
This will probably be happening a couple weeks after the new green screen stream,

28
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,240
which the new green screen stream, by the way, will probably end up being on date to be determined

29
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,860
the first week of December. I have to lock that down. I have to get the date locked down

30
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,339
with the green screen. So that means that there's, I was, I'm kind of waiting.

31
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,459
I was waiting a little bit for when I could know I could get in there on a given day to the studio

32
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:45,850
before I actually had the discussion board up. So it'll be probably a week or two after the green

33
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:53,620
screen stream. So probably mid December. And it's going to be potentially a weekly thing that we do,

34
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,410
maybe even more than once a week. Depends on how fun it is. There you go. There's your timeline.

35
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,600
So we're going to move to Bumbo. I have not, I've opened the game once to make sure that I can

36
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:16,470
capture it. What's he talking about? I will give way more details when, when stuff actually starts

37
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,589
to glue together. But December is going to have some fun streams in it. Let's just say that

38
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:36,860
anyways. Time for Bumbo. Let's watch the opening cinematic. Hopefully it's not too loud. It's

39
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,350
actually very soft.

40
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:49,399
I loved it. Bumbo take trash downstairs. Dermal want bits. All right. So this is how

41
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:55,560
teaching this tutorial. Hit me with some bones kid. I'll give you one move point. Use it to line up

42
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:07,500
four bones, then throw that bone my way. I think we know what we didn't know. Four bones. Throw it

43
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:19,000
where? So throw it right down the middle. Cool. Thanks. I needed that, but I need more. I'll give

44
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,680
you two more points this time, but I want you to line up five teeth and throw them straight into

45
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:42,149
my kisser. Bumbo make that. Throw teeth down. Okay. Wow. That packed punch teeth and bones

46
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,269
both hurt bad when thrown and the more tiles you match up, the more impact they make.

47
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:54,790
Experiment with tile combos. So if I get two lines, it's like teeth and bone.

48
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:11,060
Do I get to throw two? Oh, you're going to go twice. Okay. He's dead. Hey again. Now it's time

49
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:19,959
for me to hit you. Okay. I'm going to hit you. Whatever you do, don't match four booger tiles

50
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:37,879
and gum me up. Stun? You gummed up the works there, didn't you? Boogers only stop one action

51
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:46,549
by an enemy. So be careful. Here I come again. Uh oh. So wait. Oh no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

52
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:53,259
How do I cancel that? So here he comes again. So I can't do anything. I guess I could go like this.

53
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:05,980
This is another turn. No, okay. I can do it. Throw poop at him. Oof. I just punched a darn poop. How

54
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,179
do you know how to do that? Oh yeah. Poops can shield you from one single enemy attack, but you

55
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:21,299
know that already. Okay. Now just finish me off and I'll give you a little treat. So I get two moves.

56
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:41,740
So should I pee on him? Plus one move. I get it. All right. Uh oh. Now just finish me off.

57
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:53,529
Do they have to be in a row? Or can I just like drag? It's going to be like, okay, it'd be like a

58
00:09:53,529 --> 00:10:16,299
row. Uh oh. I did this wrong. Diagonal don't work. Okay. I'll take the money. Yep. Me again. Wow. I

59
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:26,779
really gave you a run for your money there, didn't I? You should probably heal a bit. Let me just do

60
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,259
heal. Okay. This is my health. All right. Hearts are a lot less common than other tiles, so don't

61
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:39,559
get used to healing so easily. This reminds me of 10 million, but potentially much more interesting

62
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,440
for one reason, because apparently there are like hundreds of items in the game.

63
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:50,500
Okay. It's time to get crazy now. See, each tile you match actually gives you specific colored

64
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,190
mana that you can use to cast spells. Crazy, huh? Here, take this. Okay. So I have bumbo smash.

65
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,789
Take- that spell takes bone mana to use, so just match some bones and when it lights up,

66
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:25,240
click on it and knock my face off. Spell's ready. Okay. So this is called bumbo smash.

67
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,740
Oh, I just knocked his body off. Okay. I think you are ready for a real battle, dude. Before you go,

68
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,600
let me give you a few tips. You can visit the casino. Best game ever! Best game ever! Best game

69
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,529
ever! After each boss, they'll save those coins. Bosses usually have more than one action a turn,

70
00:11:49,529 --> 00:12:03,769
so be careful. All right. I think I'm- I think I get the basics down. Bumbo want coin, the legend

71
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:20,700
of bumbo. New game. Choose your bumbo. Bumbo the brave. Bumbo the nimble. Bumbo the stout. Bumbo

72
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,139
the weird. Bumbo the dead. Bumbo the empty. Beat the game twice with all characters. What are these

73
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,779
ones? Beat chapter one with Bumbo the brave. Beat chapter two with Bumbo the nimble. Okay.

74
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:39,750
So this is the lower his health, the harder he hits. This is just standard like Isaac. So

75
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,230
Bumbo smashes four bones and then Bumbo shake his two teeth. Rerolls the puzzle board.

76
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:07,659
Sewers of Dros? Bumbo the furry. Hey Jeremy, you got a nice looking bum. Thanks. All right,

77
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:14,970
here we go. Oh, shit. This is a lot. All right. Boogers. Uh oh. All right. Let's start off with,

78
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:23,259
huh. What do I want to do here first? I'm just going to do boogers. No, I got- is it four? Okay,

79
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:31,190
I get another move. What do I want to go, right down the middle? I'm going to go right down the

80
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:45,049
middle. End your turn. Spell is ready. Bumbo smash right in the middle. Oh, they move. Okay. So now

81
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:56,970
my turn again. Maybe boogers. P? Boogers? I'm going to booger. Booger on, uh, booger on middle.

82
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:15,259
And then teeth on right. Oh, shit. He broke out. Right here. You're about to attack.

83
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:28,340
Reroll the puzzle board. I don't think I need to do that. Uh, let's see. No one's about to attack

84
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:41,399
and I have one move left. So let me go. Should I do P? Can I get P without? Let me see. Uh oh.

85
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:48,440
Wait. Fuck. I'm going to take damage, I think. Not quite. They're about to. What does P do?

86
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:59,639
Oh, P gives me more turns. Right. Okay. Got it. Got it. All right. Uh, I'm going to booger

87
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:19,419
right here. One turn left. Can I kill it? No. Is there poop available? There is. Right here.

88
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:37,740
All right. I'm ready. Good. Okay. This is fun. Okay. This is a fun one. I'm going teeth. Teeth

89
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:50,120
on the left. No. Yeah. Teeth on the left. And then in turn, it's going to queue up.

90
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,639
All right. I got two turns to kill this thing. I got it right here.

91
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:13,720
Free coins. Uh, what is this? This is a item. Snot rocket is a booger, a booger lane,

92
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:24,179
a navy beam. Destroy a column of tiles. This is four, four, two. That seems like a lot.

93
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:38,279
All right. I got the booger lane. I need to get four, then four, and then two P's. All right.

94
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,759
Let me see what I want to do here. Snot rocket. Yeah. All right. I'm going to go.

95
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:52,309
I can do just bone immediately. Does that set me up for anything after that? Fuck it. Whatever.

96
00:16:52,309 --> 00:17:03,419
This is wicked. And then no, not Bumbo smash. I could do teeth right down the middle. Bumbo

97
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:18,710
smash right down the middle. All right. Middle lane gone. This board's good. I'll keep it.

98
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:33,579
Oh shit. They've ranged. Those guys are ranged. Uh oh. Wait, hold on. That's three and then I

99
00:17:33,579 --> 00:18:04,089
could do poo, but do this. Fuck. He's going to attack. Does this take up the whole lane?

100
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm going to, I'm curious. Let me see if this works. Like if he attacks, will it hit that?

101
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,390
Yep. Oh, cool. All right. Cool. Very cool. I got it. Well, now I'm in trouble again.

102
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:27,420
I don't have enough. Do I have a P scenario? I could do five booger. I could booger this whole

103
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,869
lane. I'm going to booger this lane. And then I'm going to do a super booger on the,

104
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:49,240
like right over here. This is five boogers. I can do it twice. Let's go. Okay.

105
00:18:49,799 --> 00:19:00,150
Now I got to start killing shit. I could do, I've got bones here. I could do bone.

106
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,609
Dammit. All right. Wait, hear me out on this one. Hear me out on this. This is stupid,

107
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:12,700
but I'm going to do it. That's six bones. How many throws is that?

108
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:32,180
Two, three. Oh shit. That's actually a really good idea. Now I can just bumbo smash him.

109
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:45,019
Yeah. Still. Do I like this board? What do you guys think? Seven is a super combo.

110
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:58,789
Nana drain. What the hell was that? I got teeth and I got bone here. I wish I could split this

111
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:09,740
up, but I'll do teeth and then I'll do bone. No bone and then teeth. How much damage does the

112
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:33,130
bone do? It's only one damage, right? Yeah. Kill it. Let's go. New item coming up.

113
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:46,440
All right. Flying insects. What do they do? I'm assuming they just keep going forward.

114
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:58,700
What does this mean up here? Does this just nothing or does what does this mean?

115
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:05,829
It's what falls down after. Okay. This comes next like Tetris style. I get it.

116
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:21,500
All right. We're going to booger. Booger. I wait. Can I do P too? Booger. All right. Hold on. Watch

117
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:35,529
this. Kind of. That was pointless. I thought I was going to give more turns to like then do this.

118
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:43,619
It's all right. I'm sorry. You're going to make a mistake once or many times. How do I salvage

119
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:51,259
this? I just fucked a seven bone. God damn it. Whatever. I'm just going to line up these bones

120
00:21:51,259 --> 00:22:00,119
here. No one's doing anything yet. Let's go right down the middle. Wait. Let me make sure.

121
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,700
Okay. You go up top first. Bone smash. I wonder if now save it. Don't use it.

122
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,640
Do I have anything else to do? No boogers are in the wrong spot.

123
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:34,089
I wonder if these guys, they attack or is it just that they get close enough to hurt you?

124
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:48,539
Six boogers is an AOE. I don't want to reroll this yet. Uh oh. Okay. Now

125
00:22:52,119 --> 00:23:03,210
I need to make some poos. One, two. What if I set up like a whole row? You need

126
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:12,740
seven for AOE. Damn it. I could do one. I could do this and then poo. Let's see if this helps me

127
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:26,779
at all. I'm not sure where to go with it though. Kind of playing defense. And then how about right

128
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:42,730
here? And then I'm going to kill this with bubble smash. Okay. I can booger the lane next. All right.

129
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:55,059
You're about to go. I'm going to keep that there. So cool. All right. So they don't attack. They just,

130
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,759
you don't, you do not take damage unless this pops up, right? This is like that you're about

131
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:11,990
to take damage. It's not just, they just walk forward and hit you, right? Oh, we got a bone here.

132
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:22,619
Wait, let's see. I could do bone and then smash. Yeah, let's just bone it.

133
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:36,329
And then smash right down the middle. Oh shit. It's, it's in the air. Uh oh. All right. I'll

134
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:44,619
booger this whole lane. Whoa. What just happened? What? Why did that do damage?

135
00:24:51,529 --> 00:25:01,500
Oh hell, they had, oh it was poo shields. Oh fuck. Oh no. Okay. I get it. So they,

136
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:14,059
that was poo shields for the, I get it. Damn it. That's cool. Well, I got an opportunity here at

137
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:22,230
this. I might reroll this. No, I don't have to. Teeth and then just, I'm going to wait it out.

138
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:59,400
Yeah. You're going to run into that and I'll be fine. Heal. Did I just poop that? I could do an

139
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:16,380
extra. Oh, cool. All right. Uh, here, we'll take that. Wait, I can do a super poo. Hold on

140
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:24,150
everybody. I could do this. I could go, I could do, what does five poos do? No, no, no. What is

141
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:41,220
six poos? Holy shit. Could I get a huge one? I could do six poos. I'll just do five. Just

142
00:26:41,220 --> 00:27:00,920
going to see what happens. The stars. Oh, it's wild. That's cool. Wild. Ooh. Well, I can,

143
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:18,089
what is, I can do a big heal. Spell ready. No. Oh, all right. Let's just go. I'm going to do five

144
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:32,059
bones. No, I'm not. I even do four right now. This looks pretty neat to be honest. It is. It

145
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:48,180
actually is pretty cool. That's what I like to see. And I can bumble a smash. Does this

146
00:27:48,180 --> 00:28:03,589
save between floors? I can hold. Is this? No, they didn't. No. Okay. Okay. Eight coins. Ooh.

147
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:17,660
Plus one movement or trap door. Skip to next chapter. I don't want to skip. This is the first

148
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:27,000
time. This is my first game. Let's take the juice. Bumbo versus peeper. His eyes are slippery.

149
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:44,920
15 health. Oh fuck. Okay. So I can do, I'd probably have to freeze them. We'll slow them.

150
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:59,269
I wonder if I should just try to damage. Cause I could do one bone. I could do bone and then

151
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:11,880
movement. Check this. Wait, do they have health? Should I attack him? I'm going for him. Now check

152
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:37,900
this out. One movement. Bingo. Sticky on you. I guess. Oh, can I stick? I could have stick that,

153
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:49,849
but they would have been blocked anyways. All right. Thank you. This is not good. I could do

154
00:29:49,849 --> 00:30:03,049
teeth, but can I even hit you? This is just resisted, but these don't take any damage.

155
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:11,700
Okay. So the plays you got to stick these sticky sticky and then hit them or move them by swinging

156
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:22,490
out. Okay. He doesn't move though. Well, let's see what happens. Oh, this is not good. I need poo

157
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:31,859
right now. Right? Oh, I need two poos. I'm going to get hit. Can I get an extra turn out of this?

158
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:51,049
Yes. Yes. That was poo and a extra move. All right. Oh, look at all these moves. Okay. This is

159
00:30:51,049 --> 00:31:00,410
important. I don't want to fuck this up, but I'm going to. I could do booger over here. I could do

160
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:16,339
super poo, but that's not going to help me. Does it stack? Oh, shit. Will this poo stack? See,

161
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:32,519
that's just one. Let's try it. Oh, yes, it does. It does stack. Nice. All right. Then, oh, look at

162
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,599
that. Look at that. I could do five bones. Boy, I could do more than that. I could do six bones.

163
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:50,970
Wait, don't do that. Cause that's four. I, but I can't hit them. No, I'm not going to do it. Can

164
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:57,269
I just end the turn? I could do an extra turn, but will that help me? Big bones? I don't, I,

165
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:03,640
maybe I should move the bone down. Wait, wait, wait. How many turns do I have? No, I can't hit

166
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:16,150
them. Okay. What if I do this? Put this here or should I move? Fuck. I'm going to put this here

167
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:28,460
and then go for seven. I don't, I don't think I'm too slow for that. Do seven teeth. One, two, three,

168
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,970
four, five, six. I could go. All right. If this is wrong, it's wrong. If it's wrong, I'm stupid

169
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,289
and I messed it up, but you got to mess up at least once. Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six.

170
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:55,289
This is going to be, oh, I fucked it up. I was going to try to go for six bones. I fucked it up

171
00:32:55,289 --> 00:33:01,339
because the whole thing. No, no, wait a minute. No, I didn't. I can still do it. I can get it.

172
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:11,349
One, two, three, four, five. I'll have six. Okay. I'll have six bones. Maybe more. Seven.

173
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:20,359
I got to move this out of the way though. All right. Here's the game plan. You ready?

174
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,309
Throw teeth, move that out of the way. Uh, fuck. This whole thing is messed up. Um,

175
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:39,529
I'm going to connect four anyways. Well, I'm uh, damn it. I'm set. So I can't do seven teeth

176
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:46,619
because if I go up from here, I'm going to connect. Hold on because that's four.

177
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:57,529
This is four. Can I go over? Can I do this? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

178
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:11,380
Okay. Hold on. Yes. I'm doing teeth. No, I'm doing bones. Seven. So if I go this way.

179
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,119
All right. All right. All right. So you saying bang right here, then bring it up to make three,

180
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:31,719
then bring the wild down to make seven. I mean, no teeth, not bones. We're talking about that.

181
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:37,079
Isn't that, that's not correct. That's going to take too long. Slide the third from the top to

182
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:59,239
the left third row left. I think you mean like right here and then just go up and then down.

183
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:07,940
But then I'm going to connect. You mean like this? I see what you're saying. You guys are

184
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:20,980
fucking pretty good. Well, my way would have done it too. Yeah. My way would have done it.

185
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:37,000
Perfect. Our way is better. All right. Here we go. One, two, three, four, five, six, 17.

186
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:55,820
All right. It does four damage to everything. Okay. That's cool. I guess I could go. Let me see.

187
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:16,519
I could just booger the lane. Try to get the extra turn and get a little move and I'm going to go

188
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:28,179
here. Give me a, uh, I probably shouldn't have even done that. But I don't know why I did that.

189
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:40,519
I saw one guy. All right. So we got one. Can I do a seven bone? One, two, three,

190
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:51,960
hold on. One, two, three, four. Okay. Down. All right. Here we go. You're ready? I'm going to set

191
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,630
up the seven bone scenario. That'd be one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. I'm setting up the

192
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:20,570
seven bone. Let me make sure it is right. Then two, wait, and then, okay, let's do it.

193
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:41,559
Should I do this now? Because they're walking away. What does it do? Oh, I just fucking destroyed.

194
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:50,500
Holy shit. That's the best thing in the whole game. How much damage does that do?

195
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:13,659
Weird box in back of room. What in there? Bumble stink. Spider with long bite, big long bone,

196
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:23,019
bees with magic powers. It a mystery with no thinking. Bumble bash open scary box.

197
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:33,059
Another bumble. What a twist. Bumble the nimble has been unlocked. Just came.

198
00:38:34,019 --> 00:39:01,320
Forlorn Hollow has unlocked. That's been bumble, guys. So we unlock the next area after that.

199
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:22,760
Okay. Let's do it again. New game. Let's see. What's the new bumble do? His puzzle attacks

200
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:44,570
gain mana. Remove a single tile. Damage goes up with each hit. What that bumble do?

201
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:59,800
Each cast of the spell in a single room. All right. So they have their own poo shields.

202
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:15,349
I'm going right up the middle. Set up the fucking bones. I'm just going to, whatever.

203
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:25,739
I could do this. I could gum up the middle and then could set up a five bone scenario,

204
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:44,679
a six bone scenario. Yeah, that's what we're doing. Fucked it up. This is what we'd like to call

205
00:40:44,679 --> 00:41:17,940
fucking wasting time. Oh, let's go. What? But they have different moves. Oh, it's five. Five

206
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:25,960
damage. I thought it was like the big tooth that comes down. All right. So it's, if it's, it has

207
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,400
to be seven, not more than like five. Okay. Seven is the big one. I get it. Oh, you know when you

208
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:42,570
just like, when a run gets fucked up, you know what I mean? Uh, well, I, I think I die. We'll

209
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:55,559
find out. See if I can live. He soft locked it. I could do a bunch of pee. How many would that

210
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:04,630
give me? One, two, three, four, five. I can't do the six. Can I? I have to get all of this pee.

211
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:23,619
That'll give me, I only have two moves. I'm going to get hit. I'm dead. I can drink six in two.

212
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,340
Can I? This has to go forward and down. That's five. Forward, down. That's, I guess I could do

213
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:40,340
this. Yeah. Okay. What does it do? Not, not that good. Just what? Two more moves.

214
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:48,309
Right. Oh, actually that did help a lot. Wait a minute. I get three, one, one, two, three.

215
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:26,199
See you later. No. Wait. I'm dead. All right. No more joking around. It's time for the real one.

216
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:35,719
Uh, let's do, I had more. What? I could have done it again. Yeah. Only one more time. It's

217
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:50,179
only one damage. What? Really? All right. Let's get serious. What do I even want to do here?

218
00:43:50,179 --> 00:44:10,230
A lot of flying enemies. It goes up one damage every time. So what can I start to set up here?

219
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:21,019
I can set up bones. If I bring this over here, that goes one, two, three. Oh, check this. Yeah.

220
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:30,099
Let's do it. Let's do a seven bone setup. I'm going to, I'm going to take damage here though.

221
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:36,469
It's worth it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I'm going to take,

222
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,889
it's not worth it, but I'm going to do it. It's not worth it. Like I don't even know why I keep

223
00:44:42,889 --> 00:45:02,039
doing it. I'm dead again. It's not worth it. The ultimate greed. Yeah. I'm dead.

224
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:13,110
Cause no, I can't survive this. Could have had the seven. Oh, whatever. Yeah. Restart, restart,

225
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:19,340
restart, restart. New game. I'm not just going to set up seven and eight scenarios this whole time.

226
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:34,739
Quitter. No, it's not about getting like rows of seven. It's about trying to

227
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:45,210
control these little mutants. All right. Rocks. I don't know what they do. That's a bomb. I don't

228
00:45:45,210 --> 00:46:06,820
know what that does. Let's start with this. Oh, let's just go poop to do P. Get set up a five P.

229
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:22,949
Yeah. I'll do a five P set up here. That's six P set up. Sorry. No, it's not. Stop,

230
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:27,510
stop doing six and seven P setups. No, it's not worth it. Just do the five.

231
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:33,030
Oh, I can get seven. No, stop going for seven. I don't have to go for seven every time. What's

232
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:40,949
wrong with me? I'm just doing five. Okay. Here we go. You gotta, you gotta go for it. I can't just

233
00:46:40,949 --> 00:47:12,019
like set up five and six. All right. But I can do this. How many teats have I got? See? Yeah. I

234
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:21,690
don't have so I could get a row of 10. You're dead by the time you get there. Enemies move slower.

235
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:35,480
Stopwatch. Buzz down. Move a tile column one down. That one seems cool. So that's four bones.

236
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:44,460
All right. We got two. The bomb in the back. Poopsie here. Set up a, I could set up a fucking

237
00:47:44,460 --> 00:48:05,449
six teeth scenario. Oh, what's that? We get a six teeth scenario. Wait. Uh, this is going to do

238
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:21,349
five damage, right? I gotta remember how that works. This is five damage. Okay. Five. Yeah,

239
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:41,099
right. Don't do that ever again. Uh, take a hit. Oh, sorry. The bomb is getting close though.

240
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:57,780
Use the toothpick. I can't. I need, I need a bunch of pee for that. Remove a single tile. I could do

241
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:13,610
this. Gives me a little more time. And then I could toothpick the, I've got three moves.

242
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:28,760
This might be a set up a bone scenario. If I go down, no, it's not worth it. Just get,

243
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:53,139
I have to kill something. I'm not doing seven bones. Use the needle. It's only going to do one

244
00:49:53,139 --> 00:50:08,230
damage. I'm going to save it. Three moves. I go down and then left and then I have to hit something.

245
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:19,099
Do seven bones or riot. No, I'm not doing seven fucking bones. I can't. It's going to take me too

246
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:27,429
much time. I could do like this, which is, that's not even correct. I don't even know. I don't even

247
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:37,739
see what you're saying. Need poo to protect against the bomb fly. Wait, is he going to explode?

248
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:56,300
Pop the stuff under the bones. You mean like here? I mean, pop under the bone. You mean like pop.

249
00:50:57,099 --> 00:50:59,900
All right. But how many, I have one. I only have, I can only do this once.

250
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:14,969
I'm talking about pop like here. Drag this down. I can't believe I'm doing like a seven setup.

251
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:27,510
You guys are going to get me killed. I need to get a tooth here first. Don't I?

252
00:51:33,000 --> 00:52:00,280
No, seven bones. Oh my God. I can get seven bones this turn. You want to pop this one, this pop.

253
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:04,679
Yes, no, yes, no. All right. I'm just going to, I'm popping it.

254
00:52:05,719 --> 00:52:18,460
I have three moves. So then I go over here, which is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

255
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:39,880
Bring this one down. Yeah, this is it. Seven bones. Only seven bones.

256
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:55,929
Oh, what did I take damage for? How was the bomb fly? Okay. This is an easier one, I think.

257
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:14,730
Just kill it. And I have, oh, enemies move slower. Should I just do that? What does it do?

258
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,980
I've never, what does it do? Next wave of baddies move less. All right, cool.

259
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,820
Seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth, seven teeth.

260
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:38,519
I don't care about optimal reverse, like calculate every seven move. I just want to, I'm playing it.

261
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:53,179
Every move must have at least five to seven tiles removed each turn or inefficient, ineffective.

262
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:04,360
So I'm going to do, I have one move. Can I do anything with this one move? I set up seven teeth.

263
00:54:09,500 --> 00:55:10,679
Or I set up fucking five teeth. Who cares? I'm thinking. I'm thinking. Speak. I'm thinking.

264
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:16,710
I'm trying to think. I'm thinking, I'm thinking if I drop, I don't know, I can move just over.

265
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,369
Just hold on. I got it. I've got it figured out. I'm going to drag this over and I'm going to drop

266
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:27,449
and I'm going to get a fucking five poops. Check it out. And you're going to be very proud of me.

267
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:58,059
Told you you're going to be proud of me. All right. Now we're going to go with this because I feel like

268
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:18,099
that was a huge mistake, but it's okay. Wait, maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. I think I

269
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:23,400
can do it still. Yeah. Hold on. No, that's not a bone up there. What about a tooth? I need a

270
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:30,900
tooth drop right here. Okay. Wait, everybody watch this shit. This is what we call problem solving.

271
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:49,179
Butterbean, knock back all enemies plus one coin. Knock back all enemies.

272
00:56:49,179 --> 00:57:01,030
Nice. Bumble versus the Duke. Keep him small. Spell ready. Did I only use this once? I can use

273
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:07,940
this one time. All right. Give me chat. Give me a seven bone scenario. Let's do it. Let's set it up.

274
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:27,610
There's one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five. Move the one top to the right down.

275
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:52,500
No, fuck. I'm just. Stay still and make him move slower and give me some more moves.

276
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:16,179
Not yet. Seven P. Yep. This is not going to activate it, right? Seven P. So this is going to be one,

277
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:30,469
two. Is this even going to work? If I move. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

278
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:49,980
You can't. Omega lull. Hold on. Just wait. Up and then up. And I have fucking so many

279
00:58:49,980 --> 00:59:09,670
peas next round. Up. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Next round. All right. One, two, three.

280
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:51,659
Everybody back the fuck up. Wait. I screamed so loud. Hey, thank you, dad. Thanks for the 10

281
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:57,960
community subs. Dad. Appreciate that, dad. Thanks for the 10 subs, dude. Seriously. All right. So

282
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:05,860
let's, let's do a little, let's put it to a poop right there. And then we're going to drop down a,

283
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:24,630
I think that two more moves. Kill that. Maybe. To that. Yeah. Whatever. Then got another move I can

284
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:38,789
do. Go. Needle. Bang. Needle again. Bang. And then what's that? Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't been

285
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:48,460
slowed down. Fucking idiot. And then, yeah, just, just for fun. Just because, just because you're

286
01:00:48,460 --> 01:01:09,670
ugly. You know what I mean? Okay. That's two rounds of stun to add to our pool collection.

287
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:37,269
Is that a bone scenario over here? Nice shot. Idiot. Seven bone scenario. Is there? I mean,

288
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:41,989
I could drop this tile here, move over, move down. Wait, hold on. Are you guys for real?

289
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:49,110
This is a seven bone scenario coming up? What if I go here? No. Here. Drop the tile there.

290
01:01:57,929 --> 01:02:05,800
Let me think about this. I can remove two tiles. So let's go bang right here. I get it. I get a

291
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:14,489
bone here. You can remove. I can remove. Wait, hold on. Two, two, four, six. Holy shit. I can

292
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:21,539
do three tile moves. Okay. All right. So I'm going to remove. We need to have a communication

293
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:27,860
way if you guys talk to me in chat. Remember, think it's a board, right? So we're going to say

294
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:35,800
four. Like this is one, two, three, four. Okay. This is one, two, three, four. If you want me

295
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:44,280
to see something, you have to say one or like two, two, three, two dash three. One, two, three,

296
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:50,760
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. They're nine. Two, six, two, eight, two, three. See?

297
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:56,519
I'm not going to, if it's more than two numbers, I'm not going to read your chat message.

298
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:05,739
Okay. So what do you, what do you guys see here? You've seen a scenario?

299
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:13,500
Now everyone's all fucked up. I'm going to do, I'm doing two, two,

300
01:03:14,469 --> 01:03:22,809
two, two, three, two, two, two, three, two, three. That's my play. Two, two, two, three, two, three.

301
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:40,550
Right? That's what I'm saying. Two, two, two, three, one, two, three, four. That's only six.

302
01:03:41,190 --> 01:04:11,480
Hold on. Wait. Oh, fuck. Wait a minute. I fucked it up. And then I can do two, two,

303
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:23,000
down. And then next round, do it. Okay. Two, two, two, two, down. And then back the fuck up.

304
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:54,699
You got to give me info. Two, one, two, two, four, four, full heal. Teeth deal plus one damage.

305
01:04:54,699 --> 01:05:05,980
That's okay. These are both insane. Does this mean I can use it whenever I want?

306
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:15,820
Or does that mean it happens right now and that's it? Just once. Okay. I'm going to go with the

307
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:28,550
teeth damage. I like that better. The stat wheel. 15 cents for, hold on, this is a casino. Oh, fuck.

308
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:45,099
Randomized needle. What else is here? Five cents for heart or item or the shell game.

309
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:58,300
That's a lot. Randomize, reroll the spell. Spell charge less. Man, I need a spell cost less.

310
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:03,820
Spin the wheel. You never play the wheel at the casino. It's the worst thing to do.

311
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:26,070
What does that do? Oh, cool. Great. I got extra luck. All right. I'm going for it. Whoa. There's no way

312
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:37,849
anyone could figure that out. Nobody saw the end of that. Nobody did. Spells change each room.

313
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:56,300
I wish I had a heal though. Oh my God. You can just buy one. I have no more money.

314
01:07:00,219 --> 01:07:14,860
So what's the trinket that I just got? Randomize spells? Oh, this is all different now. What's it?

315
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:26,550
Oh, this is actually, I don't like that. Destroy a column of tiles and then blind an enemy.

316
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:33,690
All right. Well, whatever. I guess maybe you could give us an error. Does this last the whole time

317
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:40,889
I'm down here? I'm going to do that more often. I'm sorry. All right. Oh, I don't like this board.

318
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:48,070
I need to do bones though, because I have the bone trinket. So we're doing bones.

319
01:07:49,030 --> 01:08:04,920
I'm thinking, let's see. Bang. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. And then I, oh, what's that? I call that a

320
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:34,840
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven bone scenario. So that's, let me see. Oh, I don't,

321
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:39,399
no, fuck. I don't have my thing. I think to break tiles. Oh, let me see. One, two, three.

322
01:08:40,359 --> 01:09:00,180
One, two, three. I can do it next turn. I'm going to win. Am I going to die? No. Oh, all right. I

323
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:22,680
win. It was not, I don't think that was worth losing a full heart for though. This is pepper

324
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:31,130
and number one movement gaining attack. Ooh, that takes a lot of resources, but it's really cool.

325
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:41,880
Booger and knockback. I already have a knockback. I'm not buying the ghost pepper. This one is a

326
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:49,859
damn, you do damage and you get a move. I can stay alive. All right. No more fucking around.

327
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:57,500
What is this? Oh, it's, oh, it's, it doesn't matter. Everything's random every time.

328
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:09,689
Skip to the next chapter. Should, should do it. There is no next chapter. I haven't unlocked it

329
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:21,670
yet. Okay. Well, we're fine. Hmm. All right. I don't know what these guys do for, well,

330
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:24,789
I'm going to have to put some food down, I think. And yeah, let's gum it up a little.

331
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:54,579
Uh, let's throw a tooth to damage. Nice, uh, stink club. Okay. P I could just, I could move

332
01:10:54,579 --> 01:11:05,319
and just get some, no shit. All right. I could do P and just kind of recalibrate. No, I can't.

333
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:24,579
I need the P though for this. All right. Hold on. Wait. No, I have to, I just gotta, I gotta get

334
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:40,649
this fucking going and kill. What is this thing doing? Blinding attack. Gain plus one damage for

335
01:11:40,649 --> 01:12:01,739
the room. Why should I blind? I think this is like just a shield, isn't it? All right. I'm

336
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:16,060
hitting harder in the room. Gain mana equals to most common tile. Who? So if I gain, so I'm

337
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:22,729
going to gain six Pooh mana, but I don't, I don't even use Pooh mana, but just again.

338
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:36,739
Okay. I'll just do it again. Where the fuck did this come from? All right. I got to, um,

339
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:47,399
right down the middle, I got to get rid of this. I got to kill this thing.

340
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:53,960
Seven Pooh. No, I'm going to die. I get it. I've got to do bones. I've got to do bones.

341
01:12:54,920 --> 01:13:04,420
Can I do bones twice? You know, I could kill the thing that's about to attack.

342
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:21,210
Yeah, this is actually really bad. Uh, I'm going to have to kill the thing. I have to.

343
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:30,380
Otherwise I'm fucked. Spell is ready. Blinding attack. We're going to do that on

344
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:46,739
left. Gotcha. Now you're in trouble. No one's attacking yet. I'm good. Oh, this is bad. Um,

345
01:13:47,619 --> 01:14:18,140
I have to set up some Pooh defense. This is a bad board. This is not a good board. Gaining mana

346
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:22,460
for the most common tile. It's Pooh, but I, right? How many is it? Boogers or Pooh? It's Pooh. I

347
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:50,600
have to get rid of Pooh. Three, one. What about it? Two, five, two, four, two, one, two, three,

348
01:14:50,600 --> 01:15:01,930
four, five, two, five, two, four. I know I saw that too, but I think that screws up. I'll go for it.

349
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:26,550
All right. But, uh, I can't defend myself against these guys. Is it teeth now? It's Pooh. Fuck.

350
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:41,699
How much damage is this going to do? It can kill you. And then I'm going to have to take a hit.

351
01:15:49,020 --> 01:16:03,369
Dammit. You guys just keep coming out of nowhere. This is kind of shit.

352
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:18,899
Too much Boogers and too much Pooh. Reroll? I would love to. I can't. I think I'm dead here.

353
01:16:19,539 --> 01:16:40,420
That gave me a bunch of Boogers, which I don't even need. Eyes? I think dead. I could put down a...

354
01:16:40,420 --> 01:17:00,840
No one's attacking yet, so that's good. Where am I going to put it though? Over here.

355
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:10,899
I'll put it right down the middle. Yeah. All right. Come on. Give me your worst. And then I can do...

356
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:28,220
I can do an Ultra P. And then I can do a Super Booger. But where do I want that? On the right,

357
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:40,659
I guess? I guess that prevents me from dying right now. I need more teeth. All right,

358
01:17:40,659 --> 01:17:43,859
Ariel. Let's just go like this. And I'm throwing this right down the middle.

359
01:17:44,579 --> 01:18:00,550
Okay. Gain extra damage for the room. Yeah. I keep spawning these things. Shit.

360
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:12,649
It keeps... I gotta kill these things. I gotta get all the way to the back. Okay. New... Okay.

361
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:47,350
It's going to have to be Pooh Shield on the left. I need a seven bone scenario. I gotta just try to

362
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:55,539
kill one of these fucking guys. Can I get the bone? Can I set up a blinding attack? Wait, that's...

363
01:18:55,939 --> 01:19:17,590
I got extra damage for the whole floor. What was it? Teeth? Okay. I gotta set up a... Let's

364
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:32,970
gonna go, I don't know, down here. Go over here. And then maybe I could go from... Shit.

365
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:46,279
That's all I can really do. Can I stop anything? I think that's all I got. Do a seven Pooh scenario.

366
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:53,609
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. That's way too much. That can take a million years.

367
01:19:54,890 --> 01:20:04,310
The two spread out. I could go down here and then... What do you want? What are you talking about?

368
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:12,310
Set up the heart. That's a much better idea. I've set up the heart.

369
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:26,710
Whatever else you guys want me to do. Disgusting. Now I can heal.

370
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:41,350
It's not three hearts. It's not three. It's four. Oh, no. It's four hearts like everything else.

371
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:48,760
Oh, no. That was a mistake. Shit. It's... I don't know why. I just thought it was three hearts

372
01:20:48,760 --> 01:21:01,859
because they don't... It's all right. I'm fine. Jesus Christ. They're just filling the board now.

373
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:18,460
I'm about to take the... Wait. If I go like this, then I can do a shield on the right.

374
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:28,020
Hold on. Let me see what I can do. That's all you get? What kind of fucking messed up world is

375
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:38,310
that? It's only half a heart. I gotta kill one of these things and I have Pooh set up for next round.

376
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:57,159
No. I think I may have fucked it. I think I spent... I did this too many times.

377
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:07,449
It's not completely over. I can do two shields. I can go over here. No, no, no, no. I can go...

378
01:22:08,569 --> 01:22:20,199
I can do one shield. One and then... If I like your Lich Escape, 5,000 bits. Thanks for the 5,000

379
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:29,880
bits on top of your like three of $5,000 you get into this channel. You don't get to make fun of

380
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:44,699
chat ever again because you're literally playing pee-pee poo-poo. Yes, I know. Four, seven, one,

381
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:57,159
four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Left. What does that do? Thank you so much for

382
01:22:57,159 --> 01:23:06,710
like three of those. Seriously. Two, two. Two, two. One, two. One, two. Two, two. Yeah, I know.

383
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:19,020
But I don't know if that helps me. I can... I know... At least I know I can do this. I can do that.

384
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:31,750
For that. Does that help me later? I mean, it stops whatever's going on here. I need to set the

385
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:40,250
bones up. Bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone.

386
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:44,569
Instead of the bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone, bone,

387
01:23:44,569 --> 01:24:08,180
bones. You know like that? Six bones only. No, I gotta free... Seven bones of bust. I'm just

388
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:14,409
gonna do this. I don't know if everyone's gonna be like, wait, what'd you do?

389
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:36,060
All right, these guys are the worst. Okay, now I could P. I could get P. And wait, is there a

390
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:42,859
better P scenario there? Maybe. If I go over and then down, that'll give me more turns to then...

391
01:24:43,819 --> 01:25:06,949
Fucking no. And then... Maybe I could do bones. Seven bones scenario. You know what? It's actually

392
01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:13,539
kind of funny you saying that, but I think I was... I needed to kill these things fast. I just didn't

393
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:17,300
know what they did. I was too focused on like the toilet paper guys when I should have killed

394
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:26,300
these guys immediately. I need the mana for the bones. Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna go like this

395
01:25:34,789 --> 01:25:41,529
and then I'm gonna kill one on the right and then I'm gonna end my turn again.

396
01:25:42,489 --> 01:26:02,329
I can't do anything. Thankfully, no one's attacking right now. So, all right. Any bones?

397
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:26,500
Well, if I blinding attack, will it kill it through here? Or is it gonna...

398
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:34,890
Are we certain about that or is it gonna block it? What the fuck just happened?

399
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:52,899
What the... It attacked me? Why? Oh, now I really am dead. Uh-oh. Can I keep... I can at least keep

400
01:26:52,899 --> 01:27:06,840
this going for another... Who's... I'm gonna freeze you and then... No one's attacking, right? Oh,

401
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:16,220
you asshole. Right in the middle. Bones. I need bones. This is taking so much longer than it should.

402
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:30,729
I could go like this and then I need to block this guy. I die if I don't block that guy.

403
01:27:39,479 --> 01:28:04,390
It's over. You know what the real culprit was? This guy right here. I'm dead. Holy shit. I'm alive.

404
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:23,340
Uh, I could kill them both but then that... I'm just like treading water perpetually.

405
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:38,789
BZ seven bones? No, it's not. It's gonna take like two turns. But I could do five bone in two turns

406
01:28:38,789 --> 01:28:45,109
but that... Does that help me? I'm talking about like you go one bang and there's five there

407
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:59,109
or I could go... You're dead in one hit. I know. That's why I can't... I have to kill these two on

408
01:28:59,109 --> 01:29:04,600
the sides. If I don't kill these two on the sides, I have to make them... I'm just dead. So, that's

409
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:33,260
what has to happen. So now, set up the five bone scenario. Or, wait. One, two, three... I got a

410
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:54,260
six bone scenario. Six bone scenario coming up. If you can do it... If you can do it, you can

411
01:29:54,260 --> 01:30:02,939
survive these two and set up for the next. I... I'm about to die right now. If I... No, if I do

412
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:12,140
seven bones, this thing's gonna activate and it's gonna kill me. It's gonna kill me. Booger mid.

413
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:30,939
No, let me... I'm gonna do six bone scenario. Okay. Bang. Bang. All right. And then we're gonna...

414
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:42,140
I'm clearing it. And then we're gonna kill this guy on the left. And then. And only then. What do

415
01:30:42,140 --> 01:31:14,149
you mean why? If this thing takes damage, I die. What happened? I can't attack these guys.

416
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:41,319
I can't attack them. Give me some... Wait. I can do six. I could do seven, actually. No, I couldn't.

417
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:48,279
Yes, I can. What does seven poo do? Have we even seen it yet? No, we don't know what it does. I'm

418
01:31:48,279 --> 01:32:25,000
doing it. What does it do? Okay. That's pretty great, actually. That's really good. Uh, okay. I

419
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:38,439
think I'm okay for a while. But god damn it, these clouds! All right. Ugh. I need bones. I'm

420
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:50,729
just building bones. That's all I care about. If I go this way, this way, and then down, I'm just...

421
01:32:50,729 --> 01:33:10,229
I don't... I'm just doing bones only. What did that just do? Bones only. Blinding attack. I have some.

422
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:32,020
I'm not using it yet, though. Game... Why would I press this? Stop telling me to do that. And then

423
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:43,060
gum up the booger. I know. I'm gonna do it. Let's see. What do I got? I could do this booger here,

424
01:33:43,699 --> 01:33:49,739
and then... Who should I gum up? On the left? That's what I'm probably gonna do.

425
01:33:54,949 --> 01:34:12,890
And then I need these blinding attacks. It's so bad. All right. Can I throw a tooth?

426
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:22,119
I have seven bone mana. Yeah, I need eight. I don't want to use it, though, because

427
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,920
they're just gonna keep spawning them. Yeah, I have to clear these and then kill that before

428
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:38,500
that little cloud there. I have shield. I have time. Yeah, I'm all right. I just want to...

429
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:57,909
I guess I could bring this down and bring the bone over. I could do this. I could do this. And then

430
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:09,619
get the teeth. Half-Life VR game announced on Valve's Twitter.

431
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:31,750
What? Are you serious? Half-Life VR. Half-Life VR. Oh, that's fucking cool.

432
01:35:33,699 --> 01:35:37,060
We'll see, though. I'm gonna hold off judgment, because here's the thing about VR games.

433
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:44,710
This... Okay, if this is like a two hour and 25 minute Valve tech demo, then I don't care.

434
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:57,270
We'll find out. If this is the real deal, I'm in. If this is like a 48 minute long demo for their new

435
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:10,010
controllers, then I'm not in. Speaking of being in, why is he still on this level? Because it's kind

436
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:15,289
of hard. And these guys are... They spawn. You can't hurt these guys. It's pretty... It's cool.

437
01:36:15,289 --> 01:36:18,729
It's a fun game. He's trying to challenge, trying to get through the fucking hard levels.

438
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:26,619
All right. I'm setting up Bones only. And I know people are going to be like, what are you doing?

439
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:42,569
Oh my... I can't believe he just did that. Dude, I can't even watch this stream because of him.

440
01:36:43,529 --> 01:36:58,899
Bones. And we're going to the bright side. Okay. Drop that stupid gas thing. What's the better

441
01:36:58,899 --> 01:37:16,819
play? This or this? Probably that. This guy set up a five poo scenario, maybe? The poo protects from...

442
01:37:16,819 --> 01:37:22,500
Wait, what are you saying? The poo protects the clouds. If this is not real, I'm going to be very

443
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:30,569
mad at you. You guys are so fucked. Thank you. Appreciate it. We can... Now this game... This

444
01:37:30,569 --> 01:37:39,960
level's got five times easier. So now I can do this two more times. I'm going to... I could go

445
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:46,149
bang bang. That wouldn't... It's not finally we can end this. We're not even close. We're not even

446
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:53,859
remotely close yet. If only it didn't take you 25 minutes to read that. I've only been on this

447
01:37:53,859 --> 01:37:59,380
level for like 18 minutes. So like... Pump the brakes a little. Screech on the brakes.

448
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:03,859
I haven't even been 25 minutes. It's only been like 17 or 18.

449
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:12,090
All right. Let's go. Go for the health. That's a good idea. But I don't... I don't have any more health.

450
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:23,770
No, I'm set. Look. You know what? No. Okay. Go for a heart match. I need four hearts. There's no hearts

451
01:38:23,770 --> 01:39:03,930
coming down on the menu. I'm setting up the shit. I'm setting up poop. Oops. Don't fucking... I'm

452
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:14,409
going to mess this up now. Give me the teeth. I was going to do like seven poos. Almost had nine of every...

453
01:39:15,529 --> 01:39:29,460
Yeah. Almost nine of every minute. You're right. Three, nine, two, three, five. One, two, three, nine,

454
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,460
two, three, five. Three, nine, three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine,

455
01:39:33,460 --> 01:40:21,500
two, three, five, nine, eight, seven, six, five. Excellent. New spells. Like all... This thing

456
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:27,100
fucking punched me in the face and then threw me in front of a train. I don't have any spells. I have

457
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:35,989
this one. I only have this one. All right. Let's do teeth, three, smack, and he wins.

458
01:40:53,340 --> 01:41:01,829
But I do need... I'm going to... Let's go to the bones. Come on. So down, down. So up, up, down,

459
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:15,050
down, down, down. It doesn't matter. Uh, I think... Wait, wait, wait. Can I... Where's the poop?

460
01:41:15,609 --> 01:41:25,609
I can put it down. Let's poo the right. Gum up the poop. Let's go gum up on this guy and then poop

461
01:41:25,609 --> 01:41:42,100
on this guy and then see you next time. See you later. Wait, hold on a second. No, who cares?

462
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:55,500
Who even cares? I'm just going to win. Cool. Tough love. Tough love.

463
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:10,550
No, I... Finally. Let me tell you something about the word finally. I... This is all new shit every

464
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:17,979
single level. It's like I can't just... I don't know. I have to relearn my whole build when I

465
01:42:17,979 --> 01:42:27,500
walk through the door. 25 minutes. Finally. 25 minutes. Finally. Oh, that's fucking incredible.

466
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,260
Too bad. I'm going to use this many times. Okay. Reduce the cost of your spells. Okay.

467
01:42:35,899 --> 01:42:43,029
That's cool. All right. Add three wild tile. Spells cost less for the room. Heals half a heart.

468
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:57,829
So we need bones and... I mean, that's pretty awesome. Poo and goo. Let me see. How do I set

469
01:42:57,829 --> 01:43:05,960
up a good poo and goo scenario? What does this do? What's the icon on the head for?

470
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:26,069
You don't like the music? Oh, there's no options. Here, I'll turn it down. All right. I can go... I'm

471
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:35,670
going to do a tooth. Should I just try to kill this thing right now? I wonder how... Let me see.

472
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:42,010
I'm just going to hit this thing. I don't know if it does. I guess it's just dead, I guess.

473
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:52,520
Oh, fuck. It's one of those things. Poo right down the middle. I need poo and I need goo. Although,

474
01:43:53,819 --> 01:44:03,449
I could do five. All right. Hold on. Hear me out on this. I could do five. Damn it. No.

475
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:08,579
Just mute and play better music. You guys really don't like it that much, huh?

476
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:36,869
Now, if I go like this and then I go like this, I don't do that. One, two, three, four, five, six.

477
01:44:37,829 --> 01:44:48,149
If I go down with this, I get another move, though. Oh, no. I knew that was going to happen.

478
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:53,829
Why did I do that? I knew that was going to fucking happen. Did you see how I stopped?

479
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:58,739
And I was like, no, wait. Why did I do that? I knew that was going to happen. I got a double

480
01:44:58,739 --> 01:45:12,100
thing. Oh, fuck. Shit. I knew that was going to happen. Six poo ruined. Yeah, I fucked it up.

481
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:43,899
Well, I got... This is where it gets fucking hairy. Like, really hairy. I don't think I can do

482
01:45:43,899 --> 01:45:55,029
seven bones. I think I'm dead before I do it. I could set up a... I could set it up, but

483
01:45:55,029 --> 01:46:10,100
seven bones next turn. What are you saying? Like, down here, down here. Because that'll be six and

484
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:13,140
then I could drag. All right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to... I might die. Let's see if I die.

485
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:42,039
Uh, so far, it's a first, right? All right. This is... I win. No, I didn't. Wait. Uh, what do I have?

486
01:46:42,039 --> 01:47:01,640
Nine? So I just had to... No, do I gum them up? I gotta be careful about this guy. And then, wait.

487
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:16,329
Oh, my. Oh, my. Wait, wait. I don't know what I'm doing. What am I doing? Holy shit. Okay. Um,

488
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:37,060
over here, and then you, then here, then throw, then... Oh, man. We got more wild tiles. Can I keep

489
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:51,909
this? There's too many flashing, like, Super Mario stars. Um, I want that heart. I want a super heart.

490
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:58,739
No, I don't. I just want one heart. I could do a big turn. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I could

491
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:11,079
do... I don't know. This is a lot to do here. I could do a big, huge super go more. Oh, it doesn't

492
01:48:11,079 --> 01:48:24,140
matter. Why did it not activate immediately? There it is. All right. Full health. Now, I just need to do...

493
01:48:28,409 --> 01:48:50,649
Uh, I just win. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I did. Mega battery plus three movement plus random man.

494
01:48:50,649 --> 01:49:00,060
This doesn't matter anyways. It's gonna be fucking rainbowed anyways. Plus three movement

495
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:13,380
random man. I mean, what? Doesn't matter. Bumble versus dusk. All right, time. Let's go. Time to

496
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:20,920
reload everything I've known about my whole build. Movement gaining attack. Destroy all tiles of one

497
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:27,640
type. Blocks the next single attack. Charges random usable item. Hits the furthest enemy plus splash.

498
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:36,819
Okay. Plus three movement and random mana. Should I do it right off the bat? Go for it right off the

499
01:49:36,819 --> 01:49:44,060
bat. Let's go. How much mana? All right. I got, I got a seven bone scenario I can do now. I got

500
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:53,180
one, two, three, four, five moves. One, one, two, three, four, five. There's seven bones on the board.

501
01:49:53,180 --> 01:50:01,020
How do we get the seven bones to make a seven bone scenario? I don't want to mess this up.

502
01:50:01,659 --> 01:50:12,859
No, it's possible. It is. It'll be possible next turn. If I go over, over down, that's three,

503
01:50:12,859 --> 01:50:28,970
which then has this row. No, three. Okay. Hold on. I hope I'm doing this right. Okay. Then this one

504
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:41,369
comes up and then no, no, no, no, no, three. This, no, this goes down, right? Okay. This comes down.

505
01:50:42,329 --> 01:50:50,789
Then this goes over. What? No, no, that was right. Because I have to move this one over.

506
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:59,539
That's too many moves. Use one, just all to the top row. What do you mean all the top row?

507
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:12,140
What do you do? What do you mean? Do it on the top row? Should I? So like this and then

508
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:27,159
it's all right. Let's go. Uh oh. Okay. He doesn't, he just hits you. Seven bones. I almost just

509
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:41,289
double clicked. Okay. Seven bone scenario. Light them up. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

510
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:47,380
God, I couldn't do it in one move. Damn it. Okay. Hold on. Hits the furthest enemy with splash

511
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:51,479
damage. Did it in one move.

512
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:28,680
Someone stinky mom. The dog with human face. A hot dog with teeth. It's a mystery.

513
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:37,560
What's in there Bumble? Bumble back open scary box. What's this? Another Bumble?

514
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:52,470
This is the fat Bumble. You unlock Bumble the stout. And halls of Belial have unlocked.

515
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:09,539
What's your thing? Whoa, this game sucks ass. What? What are you talking about? This game's like

516
01:53:09,539 --> 01:53:29,300
coal. I like this. This is fun. This is an iPad game. It's not an iPad game. Bannum. All right.

517
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:37,050
So this is Bumble the stout stick. Whack away. That's three poops. That's a blender blade

518
01:53:37,050 --> 01:53:46,970
destroys tiles and touching tiles. Kind of a shitty stats setup though. Terrible

519
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:52,659
in everything. So far Bumble, Bumble's the best. Bumble the brave.

520
01:54:03,079 --> 01:54:12,710
Let's try the new one. Yeah, you got to play with them to unlock the next floor anyways. Yeah.

521
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:32,920
Okay, so I have whack away. So might as well just load up poops, huh? I mean, I could just do this now.

522
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,850
Or I could load up a big one. Yeah, fuck it. Let's just do this.

523
01:54:40,300 --> 01:55:12,779
Mana drain. Yeah, fuck it. Watch this. Whack away. It's two damage. Best character in the game.

524
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:28,039
Let's throw a bone. Actually, I'm gonna get hit. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. Should have killed this guy.

525
01:55:28,039 --> 01:55:32,789
I'm fucking dumb. It's all right. I'm a little dumb, but whatever.

526
01:55:46,409 --> 01:55:49,770
Stories tiles and see this is I need to use this to see how that works.

527
01:55:50,729 --> 01:56:21,140
Okay, uh, there's bone over here. And then what cares, right? You lose mana every turn.

528
01:56:22,359 --> 01:56:32,359
That's all right. Brown belt blocks next attack plus attacks or chaos. Add wild tile and a curse.

529
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:43,510
I'm not sure what a curse does, but one wild tile for two teeth is kind of cool.

530
01:56:44,789 --> 01:57:03,640
I'm going for it. All right, let's do this poop in the way. Let's kill you.

531
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:08,229
I got out of wild. Oh, that's

532
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:23,939
all right. Sorry. I just like choked on air. That was ridiculous. I'm sorry. I tried to meet

533
01:57:23,939 --> 01:57:29,220
as fast as I could. I got a wild tile here. We can gum up the mill. It's gonna happen again.

534
01:57:29,779 --> 01:57:41,020
Maybe I should, maybe we should do bones. Do it again. All right. I gotta stop fucking around.

535
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:52,890
Don't fuck around. I mean, I know I could have used it again, but

536
01:57:55,130 --> 01:58:03,539
curse insta kills enemies. What? Why would that be a downside? All right. I've got wilds here.

537
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:13,180
I could go here. I could start to build out a big bone, which would probably better this way.

538
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:22,340
Actually, no, it's going to take too long. I'm just going to do what's going to do over here.

539
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:36,680
I'm just going to throw a bone right in the middle. And then I'm going to move this out here.

540
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:50,979
And so if I block that, this is their shit, not mine. Right. So I have to block it with my own

541
01:58:50,979 --> 01:59:15,670
shit. Okay. I'm safe. All right. Let's do gum. I need to do poops.

542
01:59:17,079 --> 01:59:25,500
But let's just gum this because I wanted to get rid of it. Destroy tiles and touch.

543
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:31,939
I kind of want to know what this does. Take an area to destroy. I just want to know what it does.

544
01:59:33,779 --> 01:59:40,170
Okay. So it just destroys all the tiles touching that one. I should have destroyed the curse.

545
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:45,939
Yeah, that would have been a smart idea, but I would have gotten rid of the bones.

546
01:59:46,659 --> 02:00:20,439
All right. Let's set up, uh, bring this down. I could kill this, but I'm going to take a hit.

547
02:00:21,399 --> 02:00:44,779
What's going to do more damage? Probably this. Uh, and then I just got to throw a tooth at you.

548
02:00:44,779 --> 02:01:00,039
If I can make it work. I don't really have any great set up here. I can go up and then over

549
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:17,720
and then heal and I heal a booger down and then right. Good booger. I'm just going to do it.

550
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:30,229
Probably fucking this whole thing up, but whatever. Let's get rid of the curse

551
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:46,920
and then, I don't know, let's go. And then, uh, that was kind of fun to do that because now I do

552
02:01:46,920 --> 02:02:26,739
this. It's only one damage. Oh fuck. Keep it going. Is that he's in front of the poop, isn't he?

553
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:48,500
All right. Poop on the left, kill thing in the middle. This is two damage though, isn't it?

554
02:02:48,500 --> 02:03:11,500
See what. And now I could just nonchalantly throw a tooth at you and then get wild in there.

555
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:23,449
Do another one. Another one. Good. Now, I mean, it's impossible for me not to get something here.

556
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:33,909
So wild. Uh, it doesn't matter. I mean, I could have done something. I mean, that's cool. Pretty

557
02:03:33,909 --> 02:03:48,470
cool. It doesn't matter the play there. You just got to kill it. Ooh. Plus one damage this turn.

558
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:58,520
It's only two P, but for this turn only or plus one damage and life gain. It takes three rooms

559
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:14,020
to charge. Which drug do I want? That's a good question. I mean, is this permanent? If it's

560
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:19,800
permanent, then just use it every single second to get it. Or this is just, you can. Yeah. Yeah,

561
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:29,739
that's probably better. Peeper. I'm a peeper. I have ADHD. Get the ADDY. Okay. I see what you're

562
02:04:29,739 --> 02:04:43,100
doing there. All right. So, uh, should I do a huge poop here? I could do one, two, three, four,

563
02:04:43,100 --> 02:05:09,130
five, six. No, I could do five. So I'm gonna do it. Yeah, I'm just gonna do five. Not like it

564
02:05:09,130 --> 02:05:13,449
matters. I'm just gonna do it in the middle anyways. Uh, wait. Is it possible? No. Whatever.

565
02:05:13,449 --> 02:05:25,939
Just do it. Could I have done six? I got a bone too. Move it out of the way. I'm not going to use

566
02:05:25,939 --> 02:05:38,789
this because it's not going to hurt him. But let's, uh, I can do another turn. Can I hurt, can I hit,

567
02:05:39,029 --> 02:05:46,739
hit it with something? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Hold

568
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:55,500
on. Slow down. Hold on. Wait. I think, can I kill him? Plus one. I can do this two, four. I can do

569
02:05:55,500 --> 02:06:05,340
plus three damage for this turn. Hold on. So that's three. I can do this twice so I can hit him for

570
02:06:06,939 --> 02:06:19,300
what? Like I can do a shitload of damage right now. The teeth. Hit him with the teeth. Oh yeah.

571
02:06:23,939 --> 02:06:27,619
All right, buddy. It's time for you to take an absolute shitload of damage.

572
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:47,909
It's five, 10 damage. Oh, that feels pretty good. It's out of wild too. You know what? Fuck it.

573
02:06:47,909 --> 02:07:04,199
Let's add, let's just fill the board with wilds. Okay. I'm looking for shit here. Shit and piss.

574
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:13,819
Uh, I could just kill him, I think. Can I? There's a lot of different wild scenarios here. Uh,

575
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:21,189
uh, I think I can kill him if I just do poo. So hold on, get this over here.

576
02:07:25,859 --> 02:07:36,010
That's poo. Hold on. Cause that's one, two, three, four. It's not enough.

577
02:07:37,050 --> 02:07:50,250
No, we'll bring that back. Go this way. Shit. That's a lot to look at. Uh, I'm just gonna do it.

578
02:07:52,100 --> 02:08:00,920
I, I, yeah, I'm just gonna go for it. So let's move this. Just, I'm just gonna just connect it.

579
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,960
I got plenty more wilds and shit too. So who cares? So I'm just going to cover up the you

580
02:08:07,220 --> 02:08:24,550
and then I'm going to hit you in the face. Cursed. How did I get cursed? Oh fuck. That's how. All

581
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:38,420
right. Let's just kill him. One. Can I kill him right now? I just need poo. I could do four bones

582
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:50,699
on the left. Yeah, there it is. Goodbye. Nice. If you match seven curse, you instantly die. That's

583
02:08:50,699 --> 02:09:04,649
not good. Rat heart. May gain soul hearts or modeling clay. Copy a trinket. May gain soul

584
02:09:04,649 --> 02:09:17,590
heart. Or I can copy one of my trinkets. What do I have for a trinket right now? What's the scenario

585
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:24,699
how this plays out though? Is it just in the beginning of a room? Let's try it. See what

586
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:38,600
happens. All right. Spells hurt more. Spells cost less or reroll spell cost. Spin the wheel.

587
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:50,010
Spin the fucking wheel. Spells hurt more is absolute. I'm taking that. Pick a spell to modify.

588
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:58,020
Um, this one does three damage now. Okay. That's pretty fucking good. Spells cost less. I'm going

589
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:05,460
to do it to that as well. Check this shit out. Ready? This thing is going to be two. It's only

590
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:40,789
two. I can either spin the wheel or I can buy a heart. Set. Yeah. Yep. Let's take a look at that.

591
02:10:40,789 --> 02:10:46,659
That's going to be, I mean, I'm going to be, I'm going to wipe everybody out. If I just only need

592
02:10:46,659 --> 02:10:55,939
to focus on just match poos and I have a four damage spell that I can use many times I want.

593
02:10:55,939 --> 02:11:13,539
Pooh wizard. Let's go. Four damage for two poops. Holy shit. That's ridiculous.

594
02:11:15,850 --> 02:11:28,229
I can kill two things right now. Let's go right down the middle. Yeah. I'll put this over here.

595
02:11:28,869 --> 02:11:44,119
Let's take a look at our new move. Bang. Huh? They, I, spell resisted. I can't kill those.

596
02:11:48,579 --> 02:11:52,819
No, you can't do spells against these stone mushrooms. That's what that icon means.

597
02:11:53,699 --> 02:12:02,520
This is the room that I get the set right after getting my awesome new build.

598
02:12:08,539 --> 02:12:17,640
That sucks. This is horrible. I have to, okay, we get bones. I would have put the pooh here

599
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:30,250
if I had even remotely had thought this is a possibility. Um, wait. Okay. So I go,

600
02:12:30,970 --> 02:12:44,250
this is one damage. I could kill one of these. Oh, fuck. How many bones can I throw? One,

601
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:52,819
no matter the scenario. I mean, I, I think it's time to set up a potential re ridiculous scenario.

602
02:12:52,819 --> 02:13:03,979
No, I'm only going to be able to throw one bone. How long is it going to take me to do? I'll take

603
02:13:03,979 --> 02:13:09,979
one. I'll take, I'll have one heart left. What'd you beat? Then I, next round I can do three,

604
02:13:10,539 --> 02:13:25,590
three. Fuck it. Let's do it. Who cares? You know what I'm saying? All right. All right. All right.

605
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:37,319
Let's go. See you later. Hopefully this kills the thing in the back or at least the, hopefully

606
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:45,619
this does enough damage. Get the guy in the front. Oh yes. That was a really bad room for what I just

607
02:13:45,619 --> 02:14:01,130
built splash damage attack. So wait, could I activate the addy like three times activate

608
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:13,479
splash damage attack and then use my stick. It's sick, but I mean, that's kind of, that's,

609
02:14:13,479 --> 02:14:20,779
that's too pricey. Is it though? If we're going glass cannon, I might as well stuff it too expensive

610
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:27,659
50% of blind, but that's a, this is four, this one's six, 50% chance of not blinding an enemy

611
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:42,659
for four bones. You start from zero at every turn. Shit. That's right. Yeah. That's right.

612
02:14:42,659 --> 02:15:05,859
That's true. All right. What do we got? Let's see what I want to do here. Start. Let's put down

613
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:12,819
some shit. I'm going to go right down the middle and then we're going to kill the shit on. Oh man,

614
02:15:12,819 --> 02:15:20,729
this is so fantastic. Look at this. I did eight damage, but what's the most, what's the most

615
02:15:20,729 --> 02:15:30,819
threatening thing here? I need to know. I want is the other thing. We're going in the back. Yeah.

616
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:46,409
I don't even know what these things do, but I don't want to know. Okay. I can throw a tooth.

617
02:15:46,409 --> 02:15:56,710
I can throw a bone. I need more foos. Get some piss. Now let's do piss. Bring down the goo.

618
02:15:57,430 --> 02:16:02,390
Hold on. Wait, hold on a second. Two, four. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

619
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:11,220
Bone, bone damage. Bingo. Right. Yeah. That's a good, that's a play cause then I could

620
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:24,819
throw this once and it'll kill it. Six teeth. I'm just going to do the safe bone play. So this is

621
02:16:25,619 --> 02:16:32,889
two, four, six, two, four, six. Bang. Let's throw this, kill this thing right off the bat.

622
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:50,680
Game sucks. Blind enemies. Yeah. No, I, this is actually really cool. All right. So we're

623
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:55,129
going to attack. It's going to hit there. I don't have any shits to line up, but I could throw a

624
02:16:55,129 --> 02:17:02,069
tooth, which will give me some wilds. Actually I could throw, can I throw more than one tooth

625
02:17:02,069 --> 02:17:31,020
is the question. I could do, I could do this. Okay. Hold on. Do this. Yup. I'm getting,

626
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:47,610
all right. I'm getting a little fucking. All right. Slow down. No more. Okay. Okay. Done.

627
02:18:01,940 --> 02:18:13,479
What do I do about this? I can do down gum booger and then booger. We're going to break the tiles

628
02:18:13,479 --> 02:18:40,329
here. Right here. Okay. Then we're going to go right here. Very cool. Damn it. Bad room.

629
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:46,200
Absolutely terrible room. Did they know what build I just made? What the hell?

630
02:18:47,239 --> 02:19:05,479
I might have to try to do seven here. If I go all the way back here, like here,

631
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:15,260
I could do three. No, it's not going to work. Maybe this way. No, maybe this way. No,

632
02:19:16,059 --> 02:19:31,270
I could do six. Is that going to take too long? That shit's going to take too long.

633
02:19:31,270 --> 02:19:42,540
You can do seven and two turns. Can I though? Seven bones? That's not possible.

634
02:19:43,420 --> 02:20:01,610
If I go, I could do four poos and one P. What do you see that? Wait, hold on. That's not terrible.

635
02:20:02,170 --> 02:20:21,059
Let's go right here. Just do it because for fun, because we want to. Now I got a P set up. I can't

636
02:20:21,059 --> 02:20:25,860
do this anyway. So that's yeah. I know I, I do have a pretty good P set up here, but P,

637
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:29,299
I don't think P is that very good for seven and you only get what? Five? Maybe. I don't know.

638
02:20:29,299 --> 02:20:43,219
We'll see. I might be in some trouble here though. Cause if I go the free teeth column on the right,

639
02:20:43,860 --> 02:21:00,200
what do you mean? I could set up P. If I do this, bring two down and then I mean that's six.

640
02:21:01,079 --> 02:21:13,750
I'm just going to go for that. Knock back, right? Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean? Knock back,

641
02:21:13,750 --> 02:21:21,530
right? Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. I'm not seeing this. Teeth. I can do four on one move.

642
02:21:22,489 --> 02:21:30,459
Why am I not seeing this? Second, I got two, three, three, one, four, two, do seven teeth.

643
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:36,409
I, I, I see what you, I see you. I see what you're saying.

644
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:51,909
Fuck. Okay. Seven teeth. What does it do? I can't do it this round. I have to get, I have to take a

645
02:21:51,909 --> 02:22:02,180
hit. Am I safe? Oh, that's right. I have to poo there. Okay. You're right. That's true.

646
02:22:02,739 --> 02:22:13,020
I forgot about it. All right. I hope this works. Otherwise the runs over. Thank God.

647
02:22:19,899 --> 02:22:25,639
Destroy a column of tiles. I have too many bones, too many things that require bones.

648
02:22:25,639 --> 02:22:39,430
Copies spell at random. Let's take that. Bumble versus shy gal. Unmask and smash.

649
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:51,290
New, new boss. Copies spell at random. Should I just do it? I mean, what am I going to do? Just

650
02:22:51,290 --> 02:22:54,889
not do it. Just do it right now. Whatever it is. What if it's a bone? What if it's a seven bone?

651
02:22:55,770 --> 02:23:15,350
It might be. Oh shit. It's a throwable stick. Unmasked. All right. Hold on. Now, um,

652
02:23:16,229 --> 02:23:25,770
I could do poop right now. Let's put it right in the middle.

653
02:23:27,430 --> 02:23:46,549
Whack. Can I kill you right now? I just, I just want to. Yes. This is an insane build. It really

654
02:23:46,549 --> 02:23:53,819
is really good. I might get screwed later though. Free spell at low HP. May add poison to attacks.

655
02:23:54,540 --> 02:24:05,850
What is low HP? What would that would be considered low? Half a heart? Or would I have right now?

656
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:17,690
Probably half a heart. May add poison. Not will add poison. It may add poison. What's that

657
02:24:17,690 --> 02:24:30,440
percentage though? I want the free spell. All right. 21 coins. What do we got over here?

658
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:48,420
Spell costs less. Oh, I can't break it. I can't break the game. Cancel. Too bad.

659
02:24:49,139 --> 02:25:05,860
Cancel. Well, let's at least take a heart. Spin the wheel. Wait. Spell costs less. Reroll spell

660
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:09,860
costs. What does spell charge? Well, I guess that that's okay. I see what that means.

661
02:25:11,479 --> 02:25:18,459
Copies a spell. It's just a, I see. It'll bring it down to one room. That might not be a horrible

662
02:25:18,459 --> 02:25:28,969
thing to do. I mean, there's a wheel. So obviously everyone wants me to spin the wheel. I'll have

663
02:25:28,969 --> 02:25:42,540
enough to do one more thing. That's absolutely incredible. 33%, 33% more health and we'll,

664
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:53,219
we'll do this. Wait. Reroll spell. No. We have to get the, uh, open the box.

665
02:25:54,340 --> 02:26:15,670
Granny teeth? And I have one more coin, which that doesn't look right. The Halls of Belial.

666
02:26:16,549 --> 02:26:32,899
Haven't been here before. This is a new content. What do these do? Can I look at it? Is there any

667
02:26:33,139 --> 02:26:42,250
see what this does? You just get one tooth. Oh, all right. These guys are spell resistant. What's

668
02:26:42,250 --> 02:27:01,450
with all the spell resistant? That sucks. Gum up the one on the right. Teeth. Put the music back

669
02:27:01,450 --> 02:27:10,010
up. Uh, I'm just going to do, let's do the safe play here and dump somebody else. Or I could do,

670
02:27:10,010 --> 02:27:25,299
I could set up a seven teeth scenario. Possible. It can take a while though. If I go this way,

671
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:36,760
I can do, so if I go that way and then this way, so if I, okay, hold on and then bring this

672
02:27:38,420 --> 02:27:47,239
up and then one tooth. Wait, hold on. I don't want to do this wrong. It would have to be here

673
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:52,459
and then one tooth. No, I can, I think, I don't think I can, I don't think I can do it.

674
02:27:52,459 --> 02:28:07,129
I'm going to do the bottom row. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened? What happened? What? No,

675
02:28:07,129 --> 02:28:12,549
I tried to put it back. I tried to put it back. I tried to put it back. What? No, I want to put

676
02:28:12,549 --> 02:28:20,180
it back. I didn't put it back. Ah, fucked it up. It's, I fucked it. It's, I fucked it up.

677
02:28:20,819 --> 02:28:33,100
That sucks. Okay. That's bad. Um, new plan. I got, I'm sorry guys. I got to go with a new plan here.

678
02:28:33,979 --> 02:28:56,069
Hook, use the hook. Hook, use the hook. Hook, use the hook. What am I using the hook on?

679
02:28:58,389 --> 02:29:07,959
Do one, two, three. If I break this, it's, it'll break too much, won't it? This is going to destroy

680
02:29:07,959 --> 02:29:21,340
all this. Yeah, no, I'm not going to do that. Seven teeth spotted. Yeah. It's too much stress.

681
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:29,129
Okay. If I go one, two, three. Okay. Here we go. I'm going to take a hit, but we're going to get

682
02:29:29,129 --> 02:30:17,739
seven teeth. Damn it. God damn it. Taking a lot of damage. Too much for my comfort. Wait,

683
02:30:17,739 --> 02:30:38,969
I can't whack them. They were, they won't hurt them. Charges random usable item. Blinding attack.

684
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:48,979
That's so expensive. I'm never going to use that, but I'm never going to use the

685
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:54,969
lemon either. I mean, this is a guaranteed blinding attack instead of 50% blinding of enemies.

686
02:30:55,690 --> 02:31:14,170
Okay. Let's think about it. Let's, let's, let's do, let's poop. Right. Okay. Who is the most,

687
02:31:14,170 --> 02:31:27,909
what's the most dangerous thing here? The middle bro, I guess. I don't know. I'm going to kill this

688
02:31:27,909 --> 02:31:39,079
though. Let's go on the left side. Okay. Right down the middle. You got to be fucking kidding me.

689
02:31:55,139 --> 02:32:16,459
Fuck. Bad. Cancel. Fuck. What should I break? I have this. Not even worth done. Oh boy. Teeth.

690
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:35,700
Okay. Let's kill everything. Kill, let's kill everything. Shit. Oh, how do I kill this?

691
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:41,219
How do I kill you? I don't even know how to kill this thing. I can't take a curve. I can't take a

692
02:32:41,299 --> 02:32:47,180
wild right now. Cause if it goes right there, then I'm going to be in big trouble. Look at,

693
02:32:47,180 --> 02:33:00,809
look at this bro. Do it? I don't think that's a good idea. It's you have to do it when his

694
02:33:00,809 --> 02:33:11,430
neck is up. But when is his neck up? No, I'm not doing it. No way. Fuck. Um, okay. Now his neck

695
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:17,430
is up and there's two attacks coming on this side. I need a miracle right now. What's my miracle?

696
02:33:20,739 --> 02:33:37,540
Take a chance for once in your life. Pee into poo. Make the pee. Can I do only four

697
02:33:37,540 --> 02:34:09,750
peas though? This is important. I'm in trouble. Pee and bones. Ah, bone. Oh, guys. I don't know.

698
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:16,139
I could do this. Let me do that and do, and oh, but wait, hold on. Let's do this.

699
02:34:16,139 --> 02:34:25,350
Right. Oh, and that's an extra bone. Oh, that's a lot of bone. That is a six bone, but ah,

700
02:34:26,549 --> 02:34:32,780
how many bones do I get to throw with six? Holy shit. This might actually, I might win.

701
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:42,629
It's three throws. Okay. Everybody settle down. Two, four, six. That's four damage a throw.

702
02:34:43,879 --> 02:34:52,139
And then I can throw three times. One, two, three, and then up.

703
02:34:54,569 --> 02:35:13,129
And then up again. Here we go. Eight fucking damage. Okay. And let's blinding attack on you.

704
02:35:13,850 --> 02:35:33,909
And then on, fuck, this is going to get tricky. One heart. Bad. Although I can't kill this thing.

705
02:35:34,709 --> 02:35:42,500
I could do a couple of whacks. I can't kill this thing with a whack though. Eight health. Fuck off.

706
02:35:43,379 --> 02:36:07,290
Going right in the middle. And then kill these two and then give her the poop in the middle.

707
02:36:08,090 --> 02:36:33,079
Sounds good. All right. Poop again. Can I do poo again in one turn? Or is it bones? I'm going to

708
02:36:33,079 --> 02:36:41,899
throw a bone. Try to set the poop up. All right. So what if I go like this? No, no, that's too far.

709
02:36:41,899 --> 02:36:51,500
What about down here? Let's go over here and then set up this. Just, just do a poop setup run.

710
02:36:52,219 --> 02:36:59,540
I think I'm just going to throw. No, there's no reason to throw the bone. I just need to do poop

711
02:37:00,979 --> 02:37:06,200
or bone and teeth. Yeah, I'm just going to do it. I need that might as well.

712
02:37:17,590 --> 02:37:29,059
Shit. I'm trying to hit the toilet paper.

713
02:37:50,459 --> 02:38:06,120
I can poop next round. In fact, I want more poos. I'm going right here. No, no, it's not even worth

714
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:16,069
it. It's not worth it. Just let it play out. I can poop next round anyway. So speaking of that,

715
02:38:16,069 --> 02:38:22,309
I can go over and then up or I can go just pull it this way and I get it for free

716
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:29,750
without having to do two moves. And then would you look at that? I can set up for a booger

717
02:38:30,389 --> 02:38:49,620
next round. Can I? Sort of. I cannot hurt this. I'm going to hit it anyways. It's fun.

718
02:38:58,729 --> 02:39:05,049
All right. I'm safe. I'm just going to set up another. I'm going to set up another poop.

719
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:33,139
Could be this, right? Yeah. There it is. See you later. I need help.

720
02:39:38,149 --> 02:39:41,670
It's all enemies rerolls a row of tiles. That's really good.

721
02:39:44,459 --> 02:39:54,739
Heart bad. This is really good because I can activate the addy with this.

722
02:39:56,739 --> 02:40:09,750
Right. That would be a huge, huge deal. Yeah. I don't want the random spell. It's too, it's too

723
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:35,020
much. Oh, bumbo versus sangry. Go for the soft spot. Okay. I can, I can do a poop right now,

724
02:40:35,739 --> 02:40:58,709
which is good. Let's get it on there. Let's see if, can I hurt him? Yes, I can. Oh, he,

725
02:40:58,709 --> 02:41:09,559
when you hit him once, he closes. He has to open back up again. I get it. Okay. We need to go. I

726
02:41:09,559 --> 02:41:20,899
got to get pee because I need pee and then poo so I can kill him in like one hit. Cursed. Oh, oh boy.

727
02:41:22,790 --> 02:41:27,590
Holy shit. He's right here. Okay. Pee and then poo. Is there, is it possible to do pee and poo

728
02:41:27,590 --> 02:41:37,590
right now? I don't think so. Let me see. I can do pee, but I don't have a poo set up. Can I take

729
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:55,540
one hit? I can't take one hit. He'll hit you more than once. Oh, he's going to hit you three times.

730
02:42:03,639 --> 02:42:14,120
Is it, what's the other play here? Is to gum him up for a run? Do the blind attack. Will that

731
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:35,020
actually do it? How long are they blind for? I'm going to try it. I'll try it. Let's go for the

732
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:50,040
attack with the blind. Blind is RNG, but could save the whole thing. Let's try it. Oh, he's back.

733
02:42:50,040 --> 02:43:03,989
All right. So now blind him. Will this work? Is he going to just run up to me? I mean, I just pushed

734
02:43:03,989 --> 02:43:31,430
him. He's really far back now. Please don't kill me. One, two, three. Oh, I'm dead. I could do pee,

735
02:43:31,430 --> 02:43:38,069
but it's not going to help. Pee and then maybe throw a wild in and hope I get RNG.

736
02:43:42,600 --> 02:43:57,270
Boogers. Battery and boogers. He's knocked back. That doesn't help me though. And then hold him

737
02:43:57,270 --> 02:44:08,170
there. So you say and go bang bang and then just hold in place. Just booger him. I'm going to try

738
02:44:08,170 --> 02:44:36,739
it. Stuck right here, I think. Oh, should I destroy the carcasses? Give me shit. I need poo

739
02:44:39,959 --> 02:45:06,620
over here. Oh, should I press it? I don't think I should press it. No, I thought he was, I thought

740
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:15,930
he was frozen. Oh, it's only one. He gets three turns. Fuck. That guy sucks. Damn. Damn it.

741
02:45:17,370 --> 02:45:50,040
Damn it. Oh no. Damn it. Super booger. I'm so sad. Oh, I'll just do poo. It's better that way.

742
02:45:50,840 --> 02:46:13,530
That was a cool run. Yeah, it was. Oh well. It was cool. Permadeath? Yeah, there is permadeath.

743
02:46:13,530 --> 02:46:17,639
You just start over. But every time you beat it, you unlock new stuff.

744
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:48,629
Why'd I do that? Hold that. No, I'm an idiot. I'm a dumb as a sack of rock.

745
02:46:49,430 --> 02:47:23,739
I thought I could do seven. Yeah, we know. I don't. I could do this. I'm gonna get hit though.

746
02:47:24,459 --> 02:47:46,889
So many teeth. I'm so sad that that build was so cool. Maybe I can do a similar one.

747
02:47:51,350 --> 02:48:13,299
Change any tile to a wild. Yeah, immediately. Okay, this is a lot of boogers, but we go poo

748
02:48:13,299 --> 02:48:36,520
first always. I guess I probably shouldn't put it there, but I can. I'll be fine. Who do I gum?

749
02:48:38,219 --> 02:49:08,500
Huh? Do this. Not in any danger. I'm not in any real danger or anything. All right. Bones.

750
02:49:18,819 --> 02:49:40,500
Cool. Show Otto. Show Otto. Okay, how many throws do I get? Two. Yeah. I'll do this.

751
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:54,899
Get you with a tooth. Now you have to show Otto. Otto's such a good boy. He's such a good boy.

752
02:50:11,079 --> 02:50:15,319
Valve announced the new Half-Life game. Yeah, that's pretty big news right now, isn't it?

753
02:50:15,319 --> 02:50:25,180
That is a pretty big deal. Change any tile. Okay, I need to pee. Although, I have a terrible

754
02:50:25,180 --> 02:50:35,299
setup here to do this maybe. I can just do it now. Yeah, I need it now. Okay, I gotta start

755
02:50:35,299 --> 02:50:54,219
killing stuff, you know? Half-Life VR. Yeah, hopefully it's good. I hope it's good. I got

756
02:50:54,219 --> 02:51:00,090
a bone next turn. I'm gonna put this over here because I'm gonna kill these things in the middle.

757
02:51:00,809 --> 02:51:32,170
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. That's actually a real uh-oh. I'm not gonna kill this. How many throws do I have?

758
02:51:32,729 --> 02:51:49,690
Pretty you. Pretty you. Ow. I actually kind of somehow nonchalantly ended up making this way worse.

759
02:51:50,649 --> 02:52:05,670
Um, the soundtrack isn't great. Uh, I think it's okay. I'd like a little more variety, though.

760
02:52:06,309 --> 02:52:27,110
Try to make some wilds. I'm kind of in trouble. Uh, do I have enough to... I could do the extra

761
02:52:27,110 --> 02:52:29,989
turn, but that's not... I don't think it's gonna do anything for me. I guess I could do the extra

762
02:52:29,989 --> 02:52:40,280
turn and try to make a wild. Let's do tooth. That'll kill that. And then I could do the

763
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:50,979
extra. Yeah, let's do that. And with this, now I have any tile as a wild, which I could do that,

764
02:52:52,729 --> 02:53:13,000
which I'm just gonna do because why the hell not? Don't win yet. I do win now, though.

765
02:53:13,639 --> 02:53:23,479
Yes, I do. Wait. Yes, I do. Kill the rock. What does it get? Is there something in the rock?

766
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:45,209
Should I stall and heal? Is there actual shit in the rock? There's nothing in the rock. Change

767
02:53:45,290 --> 02:53:49,530
anything into a wild. Okay, so let me... We're just gonna stall, apparently.

768
02:54:09,899 --> 02:54:20,899
Am I really gonna do this? What do you mean wasted poo rock? I don't need... I don't need seven.

769
02:54:21,459 --> 02:54:36,889
Why do I need seven? Hit rock with poop. This doesn't do anything. Uh, well, I want to get

770
02:54:36,889 --> 02:54:40,729
rid of the bones, though, because if I am gonna just try to get this farm wilds to heal, then

771
02:54:42,889 --> 02:54:50,870
that's the plan, then. There's a wild right there. Don't throw that.

772
02:54:51,750 --> 02:55:02,729
Okay, I want to move. I'm gonna do anything. Okay, let's... I need pee to farm the wilds, too.

773
02:55:03,690 --> 02:55:08,889
I got three hits here. All right, let's bring this with pee. Let's get some pee here.

774
02:55:08,889 --> 02:55:22,680
You go down and then over. Whatever. Rock doesn't do anything. Yeah, I know. There we go.

775
02:55:23,719 --> 02:55:30,940
So let's make this... Let's bring this over here. I gotta make sure I don't actually activate this

776
02:55:30,940 --> 02:56:02,469
somehow. All right, we're good. Here's the heal, right? Yes. Let's go. Floor one. Plus three

777
02:56:02,469 --> 02:56:06,709
movement. I'm never gonna have that. Gain one to two coins. I mean, that's just free money every

778
02:56:06,709 --> 02:56:24,360
couple rooms. Vote to cancel. This is what we're playing. There is no vote to change the game.

779
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:36,840
This is the game that I'm playing. What's going on in here? If that vote passes, then we times

780
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:41,000
two the amount of time... I will spend a week playing this game. I will spend the next seven

781
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:47,190
straight days playing this game. If you... What are you talking about? I mean, I'm not gonna do

782
02:56:47,190 --> 02:57:02,280
that, but I'm having... This is a good game. Well, free coins. Let's take them. I don't know what this

783
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:13,850
dude does. Uh-oh. Kenshi. Turned him a lot about playing Bumble for seven days. Turned him a lot

784
02:57:13,850 --> 02:57:20,489
about pooping his pants. All right, let's set this up down and then I'm gonna do this. Freeze him.

785
02:57:24,540 --> 02:57:32,250
And then... I think that's fine. He can't do... Well, he's gonna move twice.

786
02:57:33,290 --> 02:57:42,809
But that's okay. I think he's just gonna get really close. But that's okay because... Do I have an

787
02:57:42,809 --> 02:57:55,639
opportunity for a poop right now? I can throw a tooth at him. I could set up a five poop.

788
02:57:55,639 --> 02:58:12,440
I could do one, two, three, four, five. Five head. I mean, I could go... I could set up a

789
02:58:13,239 --> 02:58:33,379
down here and then up and then... All right. Cool. Might be able to kill him right now.

790
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:52,649
Ooh. You break up into little things. Right down Main Street. Let's go. Oh, every time you hit him.

791
02:58:54,620 --> 02:58:58,620
All right. That's actually a pretty good thing to do. What is this? Are these extra poops?

792
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:17,780
Well, that's terrible. That sucks. I think I'm gonna have to...

793
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:34,579
I just... I don't know. Make a tooth. Yeah. Maybe it'll knock him back. Yes, it will.

794
02:59:34,579 --> 02:59:38,280
And he destroys all that shit. Did he go over the poo?

795
02:59:39,899 --> 02:59:50,569
Fuck. How am I supposed to clear all this? This is so much stuff to clear.

796
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:11,180
It's just... Wait. It's hiding them. Oh. That makes more sense. I guess I'm... Shit. This guy's

797
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:29,959
gonna kill me. I think this is R.I.P. Yeah. This sucked. I think I just need to get lucky and do

798
03:00:29,959 --> 03:00:41,979
poo, right? I'm just gonna hope that there's a poo up here. Wait. How do I... I don't understand.

799
03:00:41,979 --> 03:00:58,329
I thought it was hiding them. No? It is, but they have to be revealed before... Shit. Move the row

800
03:00:58,329 --> 03:01:06,680
and it'll uncover the one that I'm on. Well, I guess I'm gonna do this. Damn it. I was just

801
03:01:06,680 --> 03:01:10,520
where the shot... Oh, he didn't even attack me. He didn't even attack. He didn't attack yet.

802
03:01:11,940 --> 03:01:26,700
What? Uh-oh. Okay. He hit the poop shield. Yeah, he usually spits and he goes over the poop shield.

803
03:01:28,700 --> 03:01:45,030
So this is... It's the shape of these that matter. Which one is poo? Do we know? Teeth? Tooth and

804
03:01:45,030 --> 03:01:57,799
wind. Tooth and wind. Where... I guess I... Yeah, I could do this, right? Yeah. It's only one damage,

805
03:01:57,799 --> 03:02:26,469
though. Got it. That was close. That was really close. Hmm. Charge any item. More green tiles.

806
03:02:26,950 --> 03:02:37,319
Uh... Damn it. I wish that was more poop tiles. Charge any item. What do I have for item right now?

807
03:02:37,319 --> 03:02:47,590
I guess... Does the... I have the coin. I don't think that's worth it. It just means I can get

808
03:02:47,590 --> 03:02:51,750
two coins every two rooms. One to two coins. Yeah, but I can only use this once, right?

809
03:02:52,549 --> 03:02:57,860
Well, let's get the nose gobble. Let's try to build around green. All right. What do we got?

810
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:09,319
Spells hurt more. I mean, it's so simple just to make... To do this... Try to this again.

811
03:03:10,360 --> 03:03:23,020
Try the same run again. I could try it. Let's see if I can do it again. And then re-roll

812
03:03:23,020 --> 03:03:28,379
spell cost. Re-roll spell cost. Should I try to... But what if I make it larger?

813
03:03:34,200 --> 03:03:43,979
Re-roll it to boogers. Wait. That's what that does? So there's a one in five chance that this will be

814
03:03:43,979 --> 03:04:18,600
rolled into a booger. The worst one possible. Speed? I get an extra move. That's pretty huge,

815
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:33,290
actually. That's really huge. That's a big deal. Run fucked, run saved. Yeah, poop is not vital

816
03:04:33,290 --> 03:04:39,290
at all. But it still is because I still... It hurts a lot. I just did the... It does another damage.

817
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:52,180
Three damage. It was four bones. No, but poop is so important anyways. And I got so much more nose

818
03:04:52,180 --> 03:05:27,059
goblins. Well, go for five bones. Might as well. And then whack the fuck out of the middle. What

819
03:05:27,059 --> 03:05:47,819
just happened? Why is it... What? Okay. Those die when you have them all in the ground. Oh.

820
03:05:48,780 --> 03:05:55,459
Okay. Yeah. For those that die, I can't... These things, I cannot hit these with this... They are

821
03:05:55,459 --> 03:06:04,090
resistant to all spells. Well, we're just going to booger. Booger the middle too, I guess.

822
03:06:05,370 --> 03:06:30,329
And then I could do... I could do some extra moves here. Any tile of wild? Wait, did I already have

823
03:06:30,329 --> 03:06:38,700
it? No. Fuck. I think I might have... Do some poop here. I could do up. I could do up, up, and then

824
03:06:38,700 --> 03:06:58,059
wild in the middle. And then stick that right in the middle. Well, I don't really want to destroy

825
03:06:58,059 --> 03:07:13,270
anything. I got to knock all these guys down. That's a pain. I could throw a bone over here and

826
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:26,309
then whack the middle again. Sticky them again. I got to deal with those moles last. I'm going

827
03:07:26,309 --> 03:07:34,729
to throw a bone. I have three moves, so I could just... One, two... Yeah, whatever. Fuck it.

828
03:07:34,729 --> 03:07:56,469
Fuck it. Like it matters. Okay. Can I kill you? I can kill you now with teeth.

829
03:07:57,350 --> 03:08:03,190
And then I... Do I have a... I can do glue in the middle. I can do a big... I can do... Okay, hold on.

830
03:08:03,190 --> 03:08:10,969
What does seven glue do? That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I don't think I can... I

831
03:08:10,969 --> 03:08:18,819
can't do it. I can only do like five... Wait, hold on. If I go up here, that would be one, two,

832
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:30,819
three, four, five, six. But what if I go over here? That'd be one... Hold on. What if I move

833
03:08:30,819 --> 03:08:38,819
it over this way? That's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Right? I think I'm doing this

834
03:08:38,819 --> 03:08:51,670
right. Because then I go like this. And then I go like this. Do nine boogers? What happens if... What

835
03:08:51,670 --> 03:09:03,100
does that do? No, I can't do nine. One, two, three, four, five, six. Fuck. I can't do nine. Can I do

836
03:09:03,100 --> 03:09:16,459
seven though? I don't know. I think I screwed it up. I can? I can't do seven. No, I can do... I

837
03:09:16,459 --> 03:09:24,500
can do six. What do you mean you can? What? One, two, three, four, five, six. I can't... If I move this

838
03:09:24,500 --> 03:09:34,040
way... No, I can't do it. If you just do it on the top row. I'll do six. It's not... No, it's not

839
03:09:34,040 --> 03:10:10,600
worth it. Probably shouldn't do it. Whatever. Okay. These guys are a little annoying, aren't they?

840
03:10:12,360 --> 03:10:23,780
You're a little irritating, aren't you? Let's get some wild bone. How many bones can I do?

841
03:10:30,569 --> 03:10:42,340
Bone, bone. Don't even need the wild. Well, I have to use it though. I could go one, two, three,

842
03:10:42,340 --> 03:10:50,889
four. Can I do five? I could do six bone maybe. If I do one, two, three. So you say one, two, three.

843
03:10:57,399 --> 03:11:05,770
And then I could do a wild there. Wild here. No, no. Wild here. Move this over and go up.

844
03:11:06,329 --> 03:11:16,500
So go... Do I have this right? Five bones wins. Am I fucking this whole thing up? One, two, three,

845
03:11:17,219 --> 03:11:27,770
four. There's the wild. Okay. There's the wild. Hold on, Jeremy. Don't fuck this up yet. One...

846
03:11:27,770 --> 03:11:55,540
Oh, five just wins. Don't matter. Heals one heart, lose one move. Attack a whole row.

847
03:11:56,420 --> 03:12:15,450
You guys want to put on Chillstep? What do you think? Epic Chillstep.

848
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:28,780
All right. Let's put on some Chillstep for a while. Because yeah, this music is starting to like

849
03:12:29,340 --> 03:12:39,290
burn into my brain. How do I turn this down though? I know you can. I know. I swear to God,

850
03:12:39,290 --> 03:12:44,969
I saw it. Attack a row. That's pretty good. But heals one heart, lose one move. That's actually

851
03:12:44,969 --> 03:12:59,700
bad. But this could be a big deal too. I'm always needing heals. Do the volume mixer. Yeah, but then

852
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:09,750
you lose all the audio from the game too. I'm gonna do the heal. They're both six. That's a full heart

853
03:13:09,750 --> 03:13:31,399
from doing it. Where's that menu? If you use a move, is it gone forever? Only this... For me,

854
03:13:31,399 --> 03:13:36,760
yes. Because it will not technically. There's two rooms. If I press this like I should have pressed

855
03:13:36,760 --> 03:13:43,719
like last round, now in two rooms, this will be ready to be used again. Now, I have to collect...

856
03:13:44,520 --> 03:13:49,319
I almost said claws. I have to collect bones. If I get four bones, I can use this move.

857
03:13:50,040 --> 03:13:54,040
You store them until the end of the round for this character, which then you all go to zero

858
03:13:54,040 --> 03:14:07,930
for all of your abilities. It's complicated. You need to read a book. All right. I think I want

859
03:14:08,659 --> 03:14:37,319
wilds. I could go... I could just do... I need to poop. And then... What the fuck? What the fuck is

860
03:14:37,319 --> 03:14:57,430
that? I didn't heard it. Oh, what? I don't... Okay. It still is three. Fuck me. I should have just used

861
03:14:57,430 --> 03:15:04,309
that. Oh, I'm so fucking... I was so tilted from that last thing. I wasted the Lord. Oh, it's all

862
03:15:04,309 --> 03:15:18,090
right. Check this out. My God. How many? One, two, three. Okay. Here we go. Ready? One, two,

863
03:15:18,090 --> 03:15:39,059
three. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Did I have three turns? Okay. I just did a... Hold on.

864
03:15:39,059 --> 03:15:55,020
I did a shitload of stuff there. Should I hit this guy again? Will he die if I... Should I do small or

865
03:15:55,659 --> 03:16:03,430
hit the guy in the middle? Okay. Hold on a second here. Look at all these turns I have.

866
03:16:04,389 --> 03:16:13,190
Give me the coins back. Okay. I could... This is gonna take a much more calculated brain than me.

867
03:16:14,549 --> 03:16:21,370
There's bone, bone, bone. I could do a lot of bones here. I could move this over. So I could have

868
03:16:22,090 --> 03:16:29,579
one, two, three. No, I could do five bones with a wild. Could I do seven? I could do

869
03:16:29,579 --> 03:16:39,940
two. No, I could do one, two, three, four. Teeth for the heel. Oh, man. Okay. I could do seven bones.

870
03:16:39,940 --> 03:16:47,190
Couldn't I? It'd have to be very strategic because it would have to be make this a wild,

871
03:16:47,190 --> 03:16:56,620
make this a wild, which would be one, two, three, four, five, six. If I go like that,

872
03:17:06,229 --> 03:17:16,090
if I move over here and then I go down, down, and then make it a wild. Change this to a wild.

873
03:17:16,889 --> 03:17:41,909
But let's go. Still, still not doing so well. Okay. I need teeth now. How many teeth can I do?

874
03:17:42,629 --> 03:17:54,010
I could do one, two, three. I do five because if I do this, I can do the one on the right. Can I do...

875
03:17:54,010 --> 03:18:05,139
Wait, I can... No, no, no. I can do one of that. I could do... Move this down and then move one to

876
03:18:05,139 --> 03:18:20,139
the right. Go up. I need another wild. Shit, yeah. I could still do five or six because if I go over

877
03:18:20,139 --> 03:18:34,389
here, that means bring the one on the right up, bring the one on the left down. Wild on the left.

878
03:18:34,950 --> 03:18:43,799
Do I have enough time to do this? Wild on the left? I don't have enough time to do this. I thought I

879
03:18:43,799 --> 03:18:54,309
had one more move. Fuck. I thought I had another move. Wacky. I know. I'm just trying to set this

880
03:18:54,309 --> 03:18:59,700
up for success. Who am I whacking though? Guy on the right or guy in the middle? Guy in the middle.

881
03:19:00,420 --> 03:19:17,209
Streamer doesn't read chat. Yes, he does. And then let's get rid of you. Actually, go right in the

882
03:19:17,209 --> 03:19:26,680
middle. Uh, no. Right in the middle. Why do you... What happened? What happened? I can't swing because

883
03:19:26,680 --> 03:19:38,600
you're in the... He's in the air. Oh, what have I done with this one? Okay. I can kill this though

884
03:19:38,600 --> 03:19:42,040
and then I can heal. There's nobody attacking me right now, so let's just do what I was going

885
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:52,360
to do before, which is wild. Bring this down. I'll whip it at you. Insta-dead. Just kidding.

886
03:19:53,610 --> 03:20:08,379
Heal a full heart. Good. This is Candy Crush with extra steps and it was made by Edmund McMillan.

887
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:30,979
I think I'm being stupid. Am I being stupid here? Wait. Uh, get the wild and then

888
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:40,139
put it here. That's not going to work. Uh, put... Move this down and then move this down and do that.

889
03:20:40,139 --> 03:20:51,399
I don't know. Backseat. Backseat. Yeah. I mean, what is the nature of these games? You only have

890
03:20:51,399 --> 03:21:02,299
two moves. Yeah. So I have to... You still have three... Yeah. I still have three moves. That

891
03:21:02,299 --> 03:21:06,219
move... That's good at the very end. All right. I'm going to do... Let's do Booger and P. That's a

892
03:21:06,219 --> 03:21:13,620
good one. So if I go down like this and then bring it down like that... No. Oh man. I get so... I

893
03:21:13,620 --> 03:21:18,340
second guess everything I do in these games because even if there's like five ways to do it,

894
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:23,139
I will figure out somehow the sixth way that's the wrong way to do it. It just happens every time.

895
03:21:23,139 --> 03:21:29,700
Uh, I'm going to go for this. I think. I think. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet. I'm

896
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:46,969
still trying to figure that out. How about down from here? No. Let's go like this. Dumb this up,

897
03:21:50,229 --> 03:21:58,120
which will then allow me to go like this, which will then allow me to change something else into

898
03:21:58,120 --> 03:22:04,860
a wild. I could have two wilds somewhere over here. And where do I want those? How about...

899
03:22:05,739 --> 03:22:14,379
I only have one move left. I have to kill... I have to kill this thing.

900
03:22:15,100 --> 03:22:23,500
The dude right there and just throw the bone at him. But that's not going to kill it though.

901
03:22:23,500 --> 03:22:42,040
I could whack it too. Okay. There's a heart scenario. I've got one more move to do. Let's

902
03:22:42,040 --> 03:22:47,379
just... I mean, that's not going to help, but let me set up a super move for next round.

903
03:22:48,020 --> 03:23:30,700
It's the first time we've seen that. Cool. Let's do a heart while out there. Right? No. Yeah.

904
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:44,069
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I need to bring you... fuck. Okay. Up, up, up, up. Can I do this?

905
03:23:44,790 --> 03:23:57,180
I need to get P. Okay. We're going to do P, wild, and then... fuck me. Bring this up? No. Bring this

906
03:23:57,180 --> 03:24:16,649
up. Okay. Am I doing it right? I hope so. I am. Wait, don't use this yet. What if I get hit?

907
03:24:24,020 --> 03:24:35,930
Make a seven heart stack. Hold on. Wait a second. Just don't get hit. It'll be stunned for an extra

908
03:24:35,930 --> 03:24:39,129
turn. But what... Okay. What can I make? What happens if you do seven hearts? Do you get a

909
03:24:39,129 --> 03:24:52,500
permanent full heart? Do you get a soul heart? Because I would only need two more, which I could

910
03:24:52,500 --> 03:25:00,739
maybe do P's. That's a soul heart? Oh. That's not really worth it. I mean, they're like,

911
03:25:00,739 --> 03:25:09,129
it's not worth it. Seven hearts stack. There's a two-way poop right here. Does that work?

912
03:25:10,549 --> 03:25:15,350
Try to get the seven hearts. They're worth it? Well, I'm just gonna make this a wild then,

913
03:25:15,350 --> 03:25:27,610
and then see if we can make it happen. Do the two-way poop. But no, that two-way don't work.

914
03:25:28,409 --> 03:25:42,659
Uh, let's see. Can I get some more wilds here? I don't think so. That's... I don't... I think

915
03:25:42,659 --> 03:25:57,930
seven hearts is going to be kind of out of reach. Yeah. It's going to take too long because there's

916
03:25:57,930 --> 03:26:05,659
only three P's on the board. I can't... I'll just do seven poop and then I'm just going to heal.

917
03:26:09,770 --> 03:26:27,930
Oh, fuck it. Let's just do it now. Who cares? All right. Let's set up a good bone scenario.

918
03:26:28,729 --> 03:27:01,579
It looks pretty good. Don't look behind you. Munker. You can miss in this game. Oh,

919
03:27:01,579 --> 03:27:31,559
because he went up right... Wait, let's make it a good end. Have we seen these enemies yet? I don't

920
03:27:31,559 --> 03:27:48,069
think so. This might be the first time. So, hmm. P. I'm going to do P. Get a wild in this scenario.

921
03:27:48,069 --> 03:28:08,229
Down wild. Uh, these guys have a lot of health too. I'm going to go poo on the left. Then I'm

922
03:28:08,229 --> 03:28:15,270
going to do... Let's set up teeth for next round, dude. One, two, three. One, two, three. I guess.

923
03:28:15,270 --> 03:28:27,290
Whatever. Let's do three down. One, two. I just need a... I just need a P. If I do one, two, three,

924
03:28:27,290 --> 03:28:33,350
and then one, two, three, I could kill them all potentially. Fuck it. Let's go for it. Sometimes

925
03:28:33,350 --> 03:28:38,549
you got to do the big play. All right. Then up, down, and then we got one move. Um, let's go.

926
03:28:39,590 --> 03:28:59,399
There's seven right there. See if this does anything. Oh, fuck. I did not know that was

927
03:28:59,399 --> 03:29:29,770
going to happen. Uh... Well, nobody's attacking. What do I destroy? I don't think I want to destroy

928
03:29:29,770 --> 03:29:39,129
anything. Nobody's going to move. And let's go... Yeah, green doesn't hurt you unless you attack.

929
03:29:40,090 --> 03:29:47,000
So I need to wait. I could do some wilds. I think that's a good idea. Up or down? Probably,

930
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:56,520
yeah, up because I want the bone. Uh, wild for poo. Or just stick a wild on the board. Who cares,

931
03:29:56,520 --> 03:30:14,579
right? Yeah, just stick a wild on the board. Right here. Whatever. Fuck. Right here. Whatever.

932
03:30:29,059 --> 03:30:41,610
All right. This should be the boss, right? Loose change. Gain coins equals to next damage. What

933
03:30:41,610 --> 03:30:51,110
the fuck does that mean? Gain coins equals to next damage taken. So gain...

934
03:30:51,989 --> 03:31:01,290
Rudolph's a real... This one's interesting. I like that one. That seems cool. That's one coin for

935
03:31:01,290 --> 03:31:11,750
every damage you take. So like one, two, three, four. Let's just do the D12. Bumble versus Gibbs.

936
03:31:11,750 --> 03:31:24,200
Heavy hits are best. Let's go. Ah, heavy hits are best. What the hell does this jello cube even do?

937
03:31:26,579 --> 03:31:29,620
I could do poo just to get it out and make sure I get some safety here.

938
03:31:30,819 --> 03:31:35,139
One, two, three. One, two, three. Should I set up a... I'm gonna set up a huge poo, I think.

939
03:31:35,139 --> 03:31:58,180
How much time do I got? Enough, right? I don't know. Yeah, I'm doing it. Now. Hold on. All right.

940
03:31:58,180 --> 03:32:09,850
This is important. Ready? One, two. There's my wild. Bring this down. Let's do it. Super poop.

941
03:32:14,899 --> 03:32:24,229
And I can slow you down. So I'm protected, but I need to do big hits.

942
03:32:25,190 --> 03:32:33,540
Reroll a row of tiles. Which row? Seven bone or super tooth? I'm probably gonna say bones.

943
03:32:34,260 --> 03:32:44,969
Just reroll the whole top row. No, I got a wild here now though. I'm thinking drag this over here

944
03:32:44,969 --> 03:32:57,879
and be able to bring it down. Second top row reroll. I could... But I can make a...

945
03:32:57,879 --> 03:33:07,159
This is... Right now I can just throw a tooth at him. If I do this, then I can set up... Let me try

946
03:33:07,159 --> 03:33:17,399
this. Yeah, this is the one right here. Check this out. Because I'm gonna go... Next round,

947
03:33:17,399 --> 03:33:23,180
I'm gonna go bang, bang. Drag this down. Seven bone. I don't want to reroll anything right now.

948
03:33:23,180 --> 03:33:56,309
Let's do it. Kill. Oh, but he's dead. That was... He was just kind of a big piece of meat. I wonder

949
03:33:56,309 --> 03:34:05,209
what he does if you leave him alone. More brown tiles. Damn it. Now having me reroll that thing

950
03:34:06,170 --> 03:34:15,659
is a bad idea. Me having the stupid bones for the smash, it could have been... Reroll it again.

951
03:34:16,540 --> 03:34:24,549
I could. It raises crit chance, but how much does that mean? More poo for more hammer. No,

952
03:34:24,549 --> 03:34:39,260
the hammer is bones now. Remember? I know, but my whack is for bones. Remember I rerolled it?

953
03:34:44,979 --> 03:34:59,459
Crit. I'm taking the crit. Okay, what do we got? Reroll the spell. Reroll spell cost.

954
03:35:00,500 --> 03:35:26,950
Spell cost less. Reroll spell cost. On this one, you mean to try to get boogers?

955
03:35:27,670 --> 03:35:42,010
But what if it's... Fuck you.

956
03:35:42,649 --> 03:36:09,059
I'm gonna do spell cost less on wild, I think, because that's just been such a...

957
03:36:09,059 --> 03:36:14,120
It's the only thing that's gonna keep this together. On the heal, you think?

958
03:36:17,610 --> 03:36:22,739
Maybe. I'm thinking the wilds, if I could place like... Because if I do one match,

959
03:36:22,739 --> 03:36:38,600
I could place two wilds instead of one. That's the play. Spin the wheel. Movement.

960
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:59,579
Now, should I reroll the spell? Yeah, I don't... I don't care about this. I really don't. I would

961
03:36:59,579 --> 03:37:06,260
much rather have anything else. Wait, this is an item. I can reroll boats as I can. Pick a spell

962
03:37:06,260 --> 03:37:20,790
to modify? Is this not blocked out? I don't even know what the... What was that? More bones. I don't

963
03:37:20,790 --> 03:37:29,479
even know what it was. Well, this is the run here. We're gonna try. This is the... This is the third

964
03:37:29,559 --> 03:37:39,370
room, third area. Six bones. Halls of Belial. Come on, my build's terrible. Can you mute the

965
03:37:39,370 --> 03:37:45,930
game audio so I can take samples of you saying those bad words? Gain mana equals to most common

966
03:37:45,930 --> 03:38:05,739
tile. Let's do some P. Okay, I got two wilds I can put out here now. That's a big deal. So,

967
03:38:06,700 --> 03:38:20,229
super booger, I can do bang, bang, and then go up. Yep. Right? And then, fuck. Go up. Wild,

968
03:38:20,229 --> 03:38:41,299
go up. Bring the wave. All frozen for two turns. Let's do another wild on... I'm gonna say bones.

969
03:38:44,540 --> 03:38:57,719
We're looking for bones, so let's destroy some shit. Try to make room for bones. Not bad. Pretty

970
03:38:57,719 --> 03:39:15,719
good. Okay. Not bad. Really not bad at all. Let's make this a wild. No, no. What's the best way to

971
03:39:15,719 --> 03:39:24,500
do this? Drag this over one. Might be hard to do this. So, I need to do three. One, two, three.

972
03:39:25,219 --> 03:39:32,540
I'm gonna have to move these around because I... I'm gonna make four every time I move it.

973
03:39:33,180 --> 03:39:38,920
I can only make one. If I make one a wild, it'll just close it. So, this has to be the wild.

974
03:39:39,879 --> 03:39:47,850
So, that would be one, two, three, four, five, six. Yeah, I'm gonna... it's not gonna be good.

975
03:39:47,850 --> 03:39:53,290
Move the left one down. Okay, so I moved the left one down. That would be... and then one, two, three,

976
03:39:53,290 --> 03:40:00,069
four. Now, if I move that left one down, then this is a wild. It'll complete it. Move the bone on the

977
03:40:00,069 --> 03:40:04,950
right away. So, if I move this out of the way, then that means I got one, two, three. All right. Yeah,

978
03:40:04,950 --> 03:40:12,950
that's the play. So, the play is get this one out of the way, make this a wild, move this up,

979
03:40:12,950 --> 03:40:29,959
move this down, kill him. Sounds like it. Hope I'm right. So, move this up, move this up,

980
03:40:29,959 --> 03:40:51,739
move this down, kill him. Holy shit, I just got a double combo. I did. And gain mana to most common

981
03:40:51,739 --> 03:41:01,829
tile. Just whack. Because it's not... is it bones? It's not bones, is it? Because I could probably...

982
03:41:01,829 --> 03:41:11,190
I don't know, I could kill this stuff right now. Let's whack. Spell resistant. Fuck. All right,

983
03:41:11,190 --> 03:41:14,389
hold on. This is not a bad... this is not terrible because we... I'm just gonna make more and more

984
03:41:14,389 --> 03:41:33,819
bones or teeth or whatever. Look at that. Lots of bones now. Let's go. All right. One, two, three.

985
03:41:34,700 --> 03:41:50,600
If I go this way. All right, here we go. One, two, three. And then one, two... uh, one, two,

986
03:41:51,559 --> 03:42:02,260
I think. I'm just gonna tap the next round. Because this can come over here and make three.

987
03:42:04,489 --> 03:42:20,950
Yep. So, I'll make three and then bring the... yeah, let's go. So, that makes one... oh shit,

988
03:42:20,950 --> 03:42:45,940
in my pants. What happened? One... okay, we're good. Just do bones. Gain gray mana or blinding

989
03:42:45,940 --> 03:43:03,100
attack. Gray mana. Which is great. That's bones? Is it teeth? So, I could infinite heal, potentially.

990
03:43:03,979 --> 03:43:18,440
It's teeth, okay. I think that's better than this. Rerolls a row of tiles. This one sucks.

991
03:43:19,079 --> 03:43:30,340
That's too much. I could heal. I can't... there's enough scenario where I would rather whack than

992
03:43:30,340 --> 03:43:38,250
use this. All right, I gotta... let me get... let me beat the boss here. Let me at least get to the

993
03:43:38,250 --> 03:43:47,100
end of this damn game. Or at least this area. All right. Three moves. I need some pee here.

994
03:43:51,750 --> 03:44:29,110
What should I do? Setting it up. All right. Let's go. Look at how many wilds I'm gonna have.

995
03:44:36,090 --> 03:44:49,260
Three wilds in a row. And I can move five times. Bones. All right, so we've got wild here. No,

996
03:44:49,260 --> 03:45:02,409
I can move this down. No, hold on. Let me think about this. If I move this over, I could do

997
03:45:03,290 --> 03:45:38,729
one, two, three. One, two, three, and then up. Right? Let's go. Oh, fucking hell yeah. Look at

998
03:45:38,729 --> 03:45:49,959
this. I can just move and do it. I don't need the wilds. All right, I'm in a good position. This is

999
03:45:49,959 --> 03:45:59,659
not a bad... now I can whack away. Can I kill you? Are you dead? Hold on. Yeah, let me kill you first

1000
03:46:00,459 --> 03:46:08,709
because you're the threat. And then that means I got one thing left to... I don't have any more

1001
03:46:08,709 --> 03:46:28,809
moves, but can I just end it right here? Yeah. All right, I'm gonna end it next turn. Did I get

1002
03:46:28,809 --> 03:46:37,700
further? This is as far as I've ever forgotten. Uh-oh. So I'm assuming the... that means I cannot

1003
03:46:37,700 --> 03:46:43,690
attack them, right? Yeah, I made it to the boss. Oh yeah, I did make it to the boss. You're right.

1004
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:49,739
Okay. So I cannot... I have to hurt these guys with spells. It's gonna be a pain in the ass.

1005
03:46:51,780 --> 03:46:58,329
Does the big summoning bone... seven bone move count as a spell? Or do I have to kill them

1006
03:46:58,329 --> 03:47:09,750
with the whack? I wonder. No, it doesn't. Okay. Well, maybe I should just try to freeze everybody

1007
03:47:09,750 --> 03:47:20,040
right off the bat. So I could go like this. Set up a... yeah, let's set it up. So then I can bring

1008
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:24,360
this down. One, two, three. No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't hold on a second. Don't mess this up.

1009
03:47:25,479 --> 03:47:33,670
I want to get a big wave of goo. Because I want to freeze everybody. So if I bring this down,

1010
03:47:33,670 --> 03:47:52,389
that's three. Up, up. I need to... I hope I'm doing this right. Shit. Oh god. Oh god, oh god, oh god,

1011
03:47:52,389 --> 03:48:00,379
oh god, oh god, oh god. I might have to cancel this plan. It's possible. I gotta... it's possible next

1012
03:48:00,379 --> 03:48:12,950
turn. I only have one fucking move though. What? One move? No! That sucks. I can do it all next

1013
03:48:12,950 --> 03:48:26,600
turn and then... no, I can't. Can I? I'm in trouble. It's okay. It's only one heart. Oh no! What?

1014
03:48:29,159 --> 03:48:41,100
What was that? I'm dead. I ha... this is my only opportunity. I just... everyone has to be frozen

1015
03:48:41,100 --> 03:49:01,399
and then hopefully I can make something happen. I hope this works. Oh no. I'm so disappointed. That...

1016
03:49:01,399 --> 03:49:08,120
that's so... that's so hard. I'm almost dead. Ah, I shouldn't have even tried to build the big one,

1017
03:49:08,120 --> 03:49:23,319
but as a play... eee. It's okay. I'm gonna try to get bones. This is not gonna touch any bones, right?

1018
03:49:23,959 --> 03:49:55,290
No? Okay. Holy shit. Are you kidding me? This is it. Game over. Yeah, it's game over. It is, right?

1019
03:49:56,389 --> 03:50:04,840
Is there any scenario where I can live? Maybe. If I bring this down here,

1020
03:50:05,639 --> 03:50:18,389
poop up the right side, get a bone, kill the rights... uh, I think it's over. Do poop for the

1021
03:50:18,389 --> 03:50:30,709
rerolls. Where do I put this though? On the right? Reroll a row of tiles, but which row?

1022
03:50:31,590 --> 03:50:41,899
I could do P, but that's not gonna be enough. What really ha... I got screwed here trying to

1023
03:50:41,899 --> 03:50:48,659
reroll this into the green one. That was the big mistake. Do the third row. One, two, three,

1024
03:50:48,659 --> 03:50:59,209
try to reroll this whole thing. Bone and then whack. Yeah, but I still... I'm gonna... I take it...

1025
03:50:59,209 --> 03:51:12,809
I take damage. There's no way I don't take damage. Try to roll for a poop. Reroll all the rows.

1026
03:51:15,370 --> 03:51:21,819
That's just like throwing dice in the air. I don't think that's gonna happen.

1027
03:51:23,260 --> 03:51:34,309
If only I had another move, I might be okay. Whatever. Let me see. Hold on. Cancel this.

1028
03:51:35,350 --> 03:51:45,690
Here's the only... here's the play that I see. The play that I see is try to... can I... is there a...

1029
03:51:45,690 --> 03:52:07,319
no, there's no way I can do it. Fuck. I'm so sad. I'm so sad right now. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait,

1030
03:52:07,319 --> 03:52:14,819
wait, wait. Wait a second. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody wait. Don't move. I can heal, but I

1031
03:52:14,819 --> 03:52:30,950
need to... can I gain... oh wait. Hold on. I can heal a full heart. If I use this six times, I can

1032
03:52:30,950 --> 03:52:42,979
heal a full heart. Because this is only a half heart. Wild to heal, but then... yeah, but then

1033
03:52:42,979 --> 03:52:46,979
it's only half a heart. I die. I'm gonna hit three times. Wait, maybe not. Let me try it. Let's see.

1034
03:52:46,979 --> 03:53:00,139
Let's go for it. Fuck it. Here we go. Now rip. No, I didn't even know I had this up there. It

1035
03:53:00,139 --> 03:53:04,379
don't matter. Fuck it. It's fine. Everything's fine. We're gonna be fine. I'm gonna do this.

1036
03:53:04,379 --> 03:53:11,059
It don't matter. Whatever. It's okay. Well, I'm up against the goddamn wall anyways with like a

1037
03:53:11,059 --> 03:53:26,059
toothpick versus a wild bear. I'm up against the wall. Let's try to booger him. Wait. Not yet.

1038
03:53:26,059 --> 03:53:57,139
Bring this down. Oh, fuck you. I actually might not die. God damn it. If only I had done that

1039
03:53:57,139 --> 03:54:12,469
first. How am I supposed to know? They move twice in one turn. Yeah, I'm dead. Well, that was fun.

1040
03:54:12,469 --> 03:54:19,299
Well, that's fun while it lasted. Yeah, five hearts before. Yeah, but even still, these guys

1041
03:54:19,299 --> 03:54:27,059
move twice. They would have done like five hearts worth of damage. The real killer of this one was

1042
03:54:27,059 --> 03:54:33,379
rolling this and rolling it. Not only rolling it once, but rolling it twice and it was bones twice.

1043
03:54:34,260 --> 03:54:58,500
That sucked. Hold on. I'm not giving up yet. Hold on. Wait, I can do that next turn. Wait. I'm not

1044
03:54:58,500 --> 03:55:36,649
giving up yet. Oh, hold on. One, two, three. I guess I can do one. I can do a super bone,

1045
03:55:36,649 --> 03:55:44,680
but that doesn't matter. Does a bone dream exist a little bit, but not really? Wait, maybe it does

1046
03:55:44,680 --> 03:55:57,479
because then I can club. Club. I'm still dead. Move bottom row. One, two, three. Okay. If I go

1047
03:55:57,479 --> 03:56:08,020
like this, then that's one, two, three. One, two, three. I got two wilds. No, do seven teeth instead

1048
03:56:09,670 --> 03:56:26,139
and then heal. Hold on. I can't get seven teeth this round. Can I? No, I can't get seven. Can I

1049
03:56:26,139 --> 03:56:37,430
get enough to heal once? I get the two wilds. So if I go like this over, so then that's wild, wild.

1050
03:56:37,430 --> 03:56:43,610
I need to squish my eyes for a second. I have seven bones, but that's not going to help me.

1051
03:56:43,610 --> 03:56:50,860
I don't want to die. Bottom left row. Yeah, but the seven bones don't hurt these guys.

1052
03:56:53,059 --> 03:57:01,879
The seven teeth allows me to get a full heart. If I do seven bones, I could swing twice, right?

1053
03:57:02,840 --> 03:57:10,920
I got three wilds. Yeah. Bones let me whack, but bones don't heal me. And if one thing touches me,

1054
03:57:10,920 --> 03:57:21,670
I'm dead. Can I do seven twice? I need a defensive combo. Yeah, I need the seven teeth. I've got to

1055
03:57:21,670 --> 03:57:27,030
do a defensive combo. I've got to, I've got to do, I've got to bring the hammer down, heal a full heart.

1056
03:57:28,680 --> 03:57:37,030
All right, let's go. I'm fucking excited. Here we go. Ready? We got one, two, three,

1057
03:57:38,299 --> 03:57:45,750
one, two, three. Bring this one down. Wild in the middle. Wait, don't even have to do this. Wild.

1058
03:57:46,860 --> 03:57:57,190
No, don't do that. I don't want to use the moves though, because if I use my moves, then I,

1059
03:58:03,049 --> 03:58:11,100
I'm saying wild in the middle here and then over and then down. No, it's like,

1060
03:58:12,950 --> 03:58:19,879
wilds are better than the moves. I could do wild here, wild here, and then drag this one in.

1061
03:58:20,760 --> 03:58:31,770
I think that's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. Wild, wild. Bring this down. If I drop

1062
03:58:31,770 --> 03:58:36,569
this one down, then I could, but it's the same thing happens. So I could do there and then wild

1063
03:58:36,569 --> 03:58:46,379
in the left, wild in the middle. That'll do it. That's one less move. Yeah, that's true. Okay.

1064
03:58:47,020 --> 03:59:04,489
Wait a minute. Okay. Give me, give me the heal. God. Okay. You all thought I was done. Not even

1065
03:59:04,489 --> 03:59:18,870
close. You all thought I was dead. But hold on. Wait a second. I still have to worry about this.

1066
03:59:21,459 --> 03:59:31,829
Now I do a poo combo in the middle. Poo combo in the middle, then heal.

1067
03:59:34,149 --> 03:59:42,899
Yes. Drag down. Wild in the middle. Heal. Bone kill left. I can't kill the one in the left.

1068
03:59:43,540 --> 04:00:04,620
That's what I'm doing. If it's wrong, then by God, I don't want to be right. I have another move.

1069
04:00:04,620 --> 04:00:22,780
What's the move here? Reroll the, which one though? Top row? Third row. Right here. Top row,

1070
04:00:22,780 --> 04:00:31,319
but I lose the heart. Do I really want to lose these hearts to kill the curse? All right. Okay.

1071
04:00:31,319 --> 04:00:38,700
I got the heart back. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. I can do, I can sticky. I can do, I can do a sticky.

1072
04:00:43,030 --> 04:00:54,840
Sticky on which one is the question. This is tough now. Sticky the one on the left.

1073
04:00:57,610 --> 04:01:03,340
Right. What do you got now? What am I destroying? What do I need to do? I got a seven bone scenario

1074
04:01:03,340 --> 04:01:08,620
coming up, but it don't matter. But it does matter. Seven bone scenario is increasing odds

1075
04:01:08,620 --> 04:01:14,149
here, but I don't want to do that. I want to whack, which reroll something else. Hop out,

1076
04:01:14,149 --> 04:01:38,200
reroll the top row. The second row. Oh, reroll second row. Destroy two, three. What a good idea

1077
04:01:38,200 --> 04:01:51,850
that was from that person that said that. Now what? I can't do seven bones. It's not possible.

1078
04:01:53,319 --> 04:02:02,420
I can't do eight bones. I can do bones twice. Okay. Now destroy two, three. No, no, no, no,

1079
04:02:02,420 --> 04:02:10,629
no, no, no. That's not a good idea. Destroy the teeth. Talk about like up here. I fucked it up.

1080
04:02:11,270 --> 04:02:15,340
How did I fuck it up? What are you talking about? Destroy this one here is what I'm thinking.

1081
04:02:16,059 --> 04:02:30,170
I've got nine bones. Destroy one bone. I don't know what to do. I don't know.

1082
04:02:30,329 --> 04:02:40,540
This poop gets rid of this bone. All right. This poop gets rid of this bone. No, this one

1083
04:02:40,540 --> 04:02:47,030
gets rid of this bone. It doesn't get rid of this one, right? Break the first bone on the left.

1084
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:53,430
I don't think that is that a good idea? This one, he won't break this one. Why? Middle tooth

1085
04:02:53,430 --> 04:03:05,590
gives you four bones. Do not. You guys, I'm trying. There's a lot of knowledge in this chat

1086
04:03:06,549 --> 04:03:20,659
lying around. Three, one, get this one here. Sure. But okay, then I would bring,

1087
04:03:21,959 --> 04:03:30,420
I guess that's correct. Is that correct? Why did you make me do that? Oh, thank God. You're smart.

1088
04:03:33,110 --> 04:03:38,229
And then I'm going to get a double. Oh, baby. Here it comes. Next turn. I am going, no, not

1089
04:03:38,229 --> 04:03:43,110
reroll the top row. Don't you freaking me out. I'm going to go up here, get this extra turn and the

1090
04:03:43,110 --> 04:03:49,190
bones. Good. I'm just going to go. We're done. I'm not going to reroll the second row because then

1091
04:03:49,190 --> 04:04:13,690
I don't want to lose this. But wait, hold on. I only have two turns. Think about the order.

1092
04:04:14,329 --> 04:04:19,430
Other one first. This is going to complete that. It'll, what do you mean other one first?

1093
04:04:20,149 --> 04:04:40,180
Yeah, this, that's what I'm doing. But I know left first. I'm not doing right first.

1094
04:04:40,819 --> 04:04:43,780
I'm doing the seven. I'm not going to do the right one first. That'll make four.

1095
04:04:44,579 --> 04:05:08,739
Okay. I got two swings. Oh no. What do I do? Kill the one. This is three damage. I can kill one of

1096
04:05:08,739 --> 04:05:21,129
them. I'm going to kill the one on the right first. Oh my fucking God. I just got a crit.

1097
04:05:21,770 --> 04:05:31,930
Give me two crits. Give me two crits and we'll go. We're good. My God. I can't believe it. Did

1098
04:05:31,930 --> 04:05:52,010
we just do it? I think we actually just did it. Don't fuck it up. Did I do it wrong? Wild. Two

1099
04:05:52,010 --> 04:06:01,530
wilds. Okay. We're going to do bone. I win. I win. It's over. I win. No, no, no. Wait, wait,

1100
04:06:01,530 --> 04:06:15,659
wait, wait, wait. Okay. No, we're fine. Everything's good. Everything's fine. No, everything's okay.

1101
04:06:21,780 --> 04:06:34,729
Kill, kill them before I do anything. Now I can do, I can heal. Let's heal. Two wilds.

1102
04:06:35,290 --> 04:06:44,100
Bang, bang. That lets me heal. I think that's the fucking idea here. Wait, wild the hearts.

1103
04:06:44,899 --> 04:06:50,219
Only one wild necessary for the hearts. You're talking about, talking about, talking about.

1104
04:06:50,219 --> 04:06:59,139
What are you talking about here? Talking about going like this. What do you mean? Teeth heal.

1105
04:06:59,139 --> 04:07:06,180
What? Get hearts. There's a whole cafeteria of people screaming different scenarios at me

1106
04:07:07,059 --> 04:07:13,139
and I have my own scenarios, but we have to, you guys are doing a great job helping me. I love it.

1107
04:07:13,139 --> 04:07:23,020
I only have one wild, so not two wilds. So therefore we're going to do the teeth because

1108
04:07:23,020 --> 04:07:28,940
I can wild this, bring this up, which then that means I can use this. But it was, does that work?

1109
04:07:34,329 --> 04:07:51,000
Do poop because then I can just get mana. You mean play safe and make a poop poops. Three,

1110
04:07:51,000 --> 04:08:12,069
one poop, three, two wild. I got to, I got to like turn this music off. It's like stressful music.

1111
04:08:12,069 --> 04:08:21,110
It's hard for me to even think. Four, two wild, make a poop. Four, two wild. So you want me to

1112
04:08:21,110 --> 04:08:36,790
go right here with a wild and then drag this guy over and make a poop and drop it. And then

1113
04:08:36,790 --> 04:08:53,190
I'm rerolling. I don't even know the fuck I want to reroll. Make a tooth. Reroll number four. Tooth

1114
04:08:53,190 --> 04:09:37,399
and heal. Good play. Now reroll. Bottom row. Reason. Get ready for next row. In fact, delete

1115
04:09:37,639 --> 04:09:59,780
teeth for the bone. I need bones. You're right. I just like burped. Okay. I'm good. I got, I did it.

1116
04:09:59,780 --> 04:10:18,680
Game over. I win. I can't believe I have full health right now. Holy shit. I can't believe,

1117
04:10:18,680 --> 04:10:26,680
I can't believe, I'm going to say I did that, but it was like 21, 22% me, like 81% you.

1118
04:10:27,719 --> 04:10:32,040
Like it's 78%. You gain a soul heart. That's pretty good. Reroll next row of tiles.

1119
04:10:33,239 --> 04:10:52,469
I didn't even do anything. Pog jam. Yeah. I want the soul heart. I don't, I don't want this. This is

1120
04:10:52,469 --> 04:11:06,649
it. Bumbo versus Gizarda. She's, I got full health. Cannot do spells by the way. Very important to

1121
04:11:06,649 --> 04:11:27,180
know. Can only beat this with attacks. So I can do, we can do a big goop here. Get a seven bone

1122
04:11:27,180 --> 04:11:34,780
lined up. All right. Let me first, let's go up and then let's just goop. I'm not, I don't,

1123
04:11:34,780 --> 04:11:41,139
you know, what a fucking don't, don't even need seven boogers. It doesn't, it does the same damn

1124
04:11:41,139 --> 04:11:52,040
thing. It's two always. All right. Now we need bones. Let's start destroying shit for bones.

1125
04:12:00,459 --> 04:12:41,979
Looking pretty good. Now. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Big crits. All right. Let's not get cocky

1126
04:12:41,979 --> 04:13:21,399
here. Uh, I'm going to say just tooth it up. What the fuck does this mean? Uh, yeah. Uh, yeah. Oh,

1127
04:13:21,399 --> 04:13:49,430
man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay. Game over. I went whack. What? Oh shit. No, it's okay.

1128
04:13:49,829 --> 04:14:04,250
Oh no. I got two whacks. He thought he had me. Bang. I got a little too cocky. I didn't realize

1129
04:14:04,250 --> 04:14:28,700
it spun around in one hell of a thing. Weird box in back of room. What in there? Another

1130
04:14:28,700 --> 04:15:09,899
Bumble. Bumble the weird has been unlocked. Did I beat it? Three levels? I didn't see another

1131
04:15:09,899 --> 04:15:17,260
unlock. Maybe I have to beat the game like 10 times or something. All right. Let's see Bumble

1132
04:15:17,260 --> 04:15:29,620
the weird. When they kill, they gain movement. Magic marker adds more of a selected tile. That's

1133
04:15:29,620 --> 04:15:37,829
awesome. Removes tiles and throws them. Puzzle flick. You have to beat the game with Bumble

1134
04:15:37,829 --> 04:15:56,440
the weird. Beat the game with Bumble the weird. Let's go for it. Yeah, let's do it. I like it.

1135
04:15:56,440 --> 04:16:06,920
Wouldn't you guys help me do this game? It's fun. Options menu. Where did I see this options menu?

1136
04:16:06,920 --> 04:16:21,590
I swear. Is it the main menu? Can I get back to the main menu from here? It's before character

1137
04:16:21,590 --> 04:16:39,190
select though. I guess I can just quit, right? There was a bad bug in the sound setting, so they

1138
04:16:39,190 --> 04:16:57,180
had to take it up before release. This is going to be hard. Let's new game. Okay. Options. There

1139
04:16:57,180 --> 04:17:26,069
you go. All right. Epic chill step collection. Whoops. Reset progress. Animal crossing. Yeah,

1140
04:17:26,069 --> 04:17:37,559
I hate this. Animal crossing. We always go back to animal crossing though, don't we?

1141
04:17:38,360 --> 04:17:58,680
It's always animal crossing. Every time. No, not Katamari. Put on sea shanties.

1142
04:18:01,059 --> 04:18:11,190
Super Mario Brothers Super Show intro in every language. Put on Sims music. How about roller

1143
04:18:11,190 --> 04:18:57,909
coaster tycoon 2 building music? Or was it zoom out music? There we go. All right. What we got?

1144
04:18:57,909 --> 04:19:08,790
Removes tiles and throws them. I wonder how much damage that does. I didn't mean to do that. That

1145
04:19:08,790 --> 04:19:24,840
was my bad. Already fucked it up. Might as well reset and reset all progress. Reset all progress.

1146
04:19:27,219 --> 04:19:50,819
This is really loud for me. Why? All right, let's go. Bumble the weird. Let's unlock the

1147
04:19:50,819 --> 04:20:09,909
final game's mystery. Puzzle. Fuck. Puzzle. Fuck. Puzzle. I'm too old for that. Square. Okay. This

1148
04:20:09,909 --> 04:20:19,159
time we're just going tooth or poop. Right there. Right down the middle. That's a good idea. And

1149
04:20:19,159 --> 04:20:24,620
then we're going to go. I think we're going to move this up and prepare for a big one.

1150
04:20:24,620 --> 04:20:55,659
What do you think? Sounds pretty good idea. Thanks, man. This is three damage, but what?

1151
04:21:00,549 --> 04:21:06,280
Could just take out the middle. Why am I not? So they don't attack me and kill me.

1152
04:21:06,280 --> 04:21:11,319
Adds more of a selected tile. Oh, what's that? We're going to pick bone. Hey, look at that.

1153
04:21:12,280 --> 04:21:51,059
Ooh. Don't fuck it up. Um, that looks kind of good to me. What do I care though? Wait.

1154
04:21:52,790 --> 04:21:56,549
I screwed it up. This music is chilling me out too much.

1155
04:21:57,270 --> 04:22:24,250
Removes tiles and throws them. Wait, I'm getting moves. Every time I throw something, do I move?

1156
04:22:25,510 --> 04:22:36,819
Which tile do I want to throw? The poo? Oh my God. How many times do I get to do this?

1157
04:22:38,709 --> 04:22:55,639
Move on kill. Right. Holy shit. This is an awesome character. Oh my God. Move on kill one.

1158
04:22:58,299 --> 04:23:17,100
This character is ridiculous. How do you lose with this character?

1159
04:23:18,059 --> 04:23:29,350
That's so powerful. Oh, music's gone. Sorry. Uh, how about

1160
04:23:30,459 --> 04:23:33,020
Metroid? Relaxing and ambient music from Metroid.

1161
04:23:33,659 --> 04:23:41,219
Blocks the next two attacks. Move a tile row one to the right or blocks the next two attacks.

1162
04:23:41,940 --> 04:23:51,879
The buzz looks pretty crazy. Booger sink. That's a good idea.

1163
04:23:52,680 --> 04:24:09,000
Okay. We just need to kill one. So I'm thinking tooth. No, hold on. Yeah, let's get tooth.

1164
04:24:09,719 --> 04:24:17,959
This should lead us into a...

1165
04:24:21,979 --> 04:24:30,899
adds more of a selected tile. We're going to go with, uh, we're going to go with, uh, bones. Okay.

1166
04:24:33,559 --> 04:24:42,329
Keep up the killing spree. And we got to do it again. Removes a tile. So let's get rid of this one

1167
04:24:43,370 --> 04:24:49,479
and throw it this way. What are you going to do, huh?

1168
04:24:54,459 --> 04:25:00,729
What a room full of shitty enemies. I don't want to get too cocky.

1169
04:25:01,290 --> 04:25:25,159
That's pretty much it. I can do... no, I can do this. Play Half-Life music in honor of Half-Life VR.

1170
04:25:27,430 --> 04:25:57,690
I could, but will I? No. Just add more hearts. Yeah, I mean, this is kind of doing well for me now.

1171
04:26:07,420 --> 04:26:17,129
Turn one kill. I feel like, um, Bumbo the Weird might little, little bit of extra tuning.

1172
04:26:19,340 --> 04:26:27,399
Seems, uh, very, very, very, very good. So what's with these rooms? Is this

1173
04:26:28,920 --> 04:26:53,129
designed around just a bunch of random enemies in a room? Okay, let me go. Okay, I'm ready for

1174
04:26:53,129 --> 04:27:04,280
another one. Um, I kind of want to do... let's throw out... what do I want to throw out? This one here.

1175
04:27:05,079 --> 04:27:21,700
Yep, check it. And then that allows me to... like this. First turn. You never get a chance.

1176
04:27:24,090 --> 04:27:29,459
You're not going to get a single chance. Although, wait a minute. Maybe you do get a chance.

1177
04:27:31,590 --> 04:27:42,440
Do I have a four? I could do that. Move a tile to the right. It's... hold on. This is possible for me

1178
04:27:42,440 --> 04:27:49,620
to do this. Because now I can just move to the right. Uh, how many times am I going to do this?

1179
04:27:49,620 --> 04:27:54,569
Four times. So move a tile to the right. We're gonna do...

1180
04:28:07,459 --> 04:28:38,469
Let's get some bones. Um, now we're gonna remove the... this one and kill you. I think that's...

1181
04:28:38,469 --> 04:28:51,700
no, I'm not done. What happened? What do you mean miss? I... it's because I clicked in the wrong

1182
04:28:51,780 --> 04:29:09,979
section or something. What the fuck was that? I'm just kind of dumb. Whatever. Uh,

1183
04:29:11,100 --> 04:29:17,020
I've ruined it. Yeah, I guess if you miss click in the wrong row, you just throws it down the...

1184
04:29:17,659 --> 04:29:33,850
I guess. Okay, whatever. Oh, let's go this way. Yeah, that's... whatever. You can... that'll care.

1185
04:29:38,950 --> 04:29:52,059
One, two, three. Middle is empty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Charges random usable item.

1186
04:29:54,409 --> 04:30:14,139
Copies spell at random. These both suck. Bumbo versus peeper. All right, let's just pick a tile

1187
04:30:14,139 --> 04:30:34,100
to throw. Well, you made that easy for me. Now let's go like this. This is gonna be beautiful.

1188
04:30:37,370 --> 04:31:00,649
Add more to select the tile. We're gonna go with wilds. Bug. Removes the tile. We're gonna remove...

1189
04:31:00,649 --> 04:31:18,600
What should we remove? Uh, probably this here. Go again. And now we can do the sticky. We can do

1190
04:31:18,600 --> 04:31:37,690
actually a big sticky. You ain't going anywhere. Move a tile one row to the right. Well,

1191
04:31:38,729 --> 04:31:51,979
if you ask, I'll do it. Eyes? What about the eyes? They're not even gonna get a chance.

1192
04:31:52,620 --> 04:31:59,219
This dude's dead. I can move to the right and I would get... uh, no, should I do? What should

1193
04:31:59,219 --> 04:32:07,290
I do? Move what to the right? I can do it four times. One, two, three, four. Is that gonna help?

1194
04:32:07,930 --> 04:32:22,620
What should I move? The teeth. Row... the second row? Third and fourth rows? Oh, would you look at

1195
04:32:22,620 --> 04:32:46,569
that? We're just gonna keep going. I'm gonna remove this booger. Dead. That was turn one.

1196
04:32:51,540 --> 04:33:00,700
Items are on sale. 50% off. That's like automatic. That's an automatic click.

1197
04:33:03,110 --> 04:33:12,939
All right. What do we got? Spell cost? Spell hurts more. This has a question mark around it, but

1198
04:33:12,939 --> 04:33:25,720
can I actually increase this? Or is this a waste? It doesn't... it doesn't work. It's broken. Don't.

1199
04:33:25,720 --> 04:33:35,909
It's not worth it. No. It's a scam. Okay. Um, reroll spell. I could reroll this. Try to get

1200
04:33:35,909 --> 04:33:52,380
something better because this thing sucks. Um, that's insane. Plus one movement. I could, uh,

1201
04:33:55,340 --> 04:34:02,520
should I reroll its cost from poop? No, I need a poop sink, don't I? No, I need a poop sink. Spell

1202
04:34:02,520 --> 04:34:11,049
hurts more. That's fine. We'll keep that the way it is. Let's roll it. What do the puzzle pieces

1203
04:34:11,049 --> 04:34:21,959
mean? More spell damage? That's really good too. All right. Give me a hand on this one.

1204
04:34:23,380 --> 04:34:32,340
More yellow tiles. I need this one. This one's, that's huge. This is like, I'm guaranteed to win

1205
04:34:32,340 --> 04:34:40,340
if I get it. If I get this, this is, there's no way I lose again. Left? This is too important. I need

1206
04:34:40,340 --> 04:34:47,750
to pull. Yeah, it's way too important. I'm sorry. Because this is a guaranteed absolute 100%. There's

1207
04:34:47,750 --> 04:35:10,540
no way I lose. Okay. Give me a hint. It's random? I know, but I don't want it to be my fault.

1208
04:35:11,259 --> 04:35:27,529
Most people are saying left or middle. I would probably have said,

1209
04:35:28,090 --> 04:35:38,900
I'm not going to tell you because I don't want it to be my fault. All right. Number one is left.

1210
04:35:38,900 --> 04:35:43,220
Uh, but I'm going to go with right because it's the least. God damn it. Which one was it?

1211
04:35:54,740 --> 04:35:56,099
Now it is my fault.

1212
04:36:02,360 --> 04:36:09,110
Should I reroll the spells cost on one of these? What if I reroll this and it's like a two?

1213
04:36:10,840 --> 04:36:32,900
Oh, whatever. Koala brain. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I figured that would have been such like a pog

1214
04:36:32,900 --> 04:36:38,380
moment. No, for me. Sorry. We don't need it. We don't need it. We don't need it. We're just

1215
04:36:38,380 --> 04:36:43,990
going to kill the thing. How many, what do I got? I got three moves. Let's get a bone in here.

1216
04:36:44,790 --> 04:36:53,220
Toss it right up the left side. And then we're going to do, got another move left here. We're

1217
04:36:53,220 --> 04:36:58,790
going to do, uh, let's see. I wonder what I want to do with this one. I think we're going to probably

1218
04:36:58,790 --> 04:37:09,750
do, uh, anybody see anything? Anybody see anything? I could line up a pretty good, uh,

1219
04:37:19,029 --> 04:37:40,540
set up for a yellow, um, I could do teeth and set up teeth. Uh, okay. This thing's going to

1220
04:37:40,540 --> 04:37:48,220
explode on me. Okay. I need teeth and I can remove. I know here we go. I'm going to go like this,

1221
04:37:48,220 --> 04:38:00,630
which will be, no, no. What are you an imbecile? Are you dumb? Poop is movement. Yeah. Yep. Fuck.

1222
04:38:00,630 --> 04:38:52,490
Yep. Oh, hold on. That's actually not that good. Okay. I'm going to slow down here.

1223
04:38:53,689 --> 04:39:04,650
I have a shit load of teeth. Three, three. I could do seven teeth and I can kill the fly.

1224
04:39:04,650 --> 04:39:15,580
It fucking hurts. Okay. Then I'm going to, I gotta kill this other fly. It's screwing me up.

1225
04:39:16,779 --> 04:39:19,979
Get rid of this, uh, bone. No, which, how do I make this better?

1226
04:39:22,200 --> 04:39:28,259
Get rid of this bone, right? Give her to the booger right here. Booger, booger, booger, booger,

1227
04:39:28,259 --> 04:39:34,229
booger, booger, booger, booger, booger, booger, booger. Give her to this P. Give her to this booger.

1228
04:39:34,229 --> 04:39:36,630
Give her to the P at the top. Give her to the booger. Give her to the P.

1229
04:39:37,509 --> 04:39:52,580
Get her ready to do the poop first. Okay. All right. Okay. Then we can do, we can do the

1230
04:39:52,580 --> 04:40:21,830
one movement. Booger. Remove this tile. Bingo. Oh, what's that? Now, oh, I can move. Let's move

1231
04:40:22,389 --> 04:40:29,189
the tiles now. Don't waste any moves. Why don't I just go like this and then go like this again.

1232
04:40:29,189 --> 04:40:38,979
Get the bone, get my extra turn. Now I can remove this tile here, this tooth,

1233
04:40:39,700 --> 04:40:46,790
because who gives a shit? Bingo. Throw it. We're dead. No, you're not. I fucking hate this game.

1234
04:40:47,349 --> 04:41:18,009
I hate it. Okay. I messed up. He's so moody. I need teeth. I'm out of hearts though. This is

1235
04:41:18,009 --> 04:41:39,770
actually not good. Let's go. I'm an idiot. Oh, right. I don't lose it between turns.

1236
04:41:40,409 --> 04:42:02,279
I forgot. Different character. Explode. Make the hearts. Oh yeah. Fuck. I'm too busy.

1237
04:42:03,720 --> 04:42:10,119
Splash back attack. Attacking enemies. Attacking enemies take damage or splash back. I can't even

1238
04:42:10,119 --> 04:42:28,069
heal anyways. I think the splash back is the one. This is a lot of enemies. This is a lot. Okay. I

1239
04:42:28,069 --> 04:42:38,919
can't really fuck around now. I only have one heart. I could set up a huge poop. This is what

1240
04:42:38,919 --> 04:42:56,630
I'm going to do. And then we're going to do a teeth setup. So let's see, what's the best way to do this?

1241
04:42:57,430 --> 04:43:16,779
There's like a bunch of ways I could probably do this. You go this way. Go one, two, fuck no.

1242
04:43:17,500 --> 04:43:34,360
Do seven bones instead. I actually, I need the seven. I need to do the stomp. If I get one,

1243
04:43:34,360 --> 04:43:55,939
two, three, one, two, three, four, five, six, move this one down. Bone at the top. Um,

1244
04:43:57,340 --> 04:44:10,540
bones are good too. Yeah, I know, but I have a lot of teeth. And then if I go like this,

1245
04:44:12,009 --> 04:44:29,349
move you up. Wait. Okay. Yeah. I do with the poop shields. It's right. This should do it now.

1246
04:44:29,990 --> 04:44:47,580
All right. So we got seven here. Okay. They're all dead. Good. Cool. Okay. Bones.

1247
04:44:52,330 --> 04:45:01,029
Let's go right down the middle. I'm doing it again because you can only take damage from this shit.

1248
04:45:01,669 --> 04:45:17,220
Right. Let's get a poop on the left side. Yeah. And that allows me to add a movement and I can

1249
04:45:17,220 --> 04:45:30,630
make more tiles and you know what we're doing. I mean, obviously teeth. So I could go one, two,

1250
04:45:30,630 --> 04:45:37,270
grab it. I could do a big one here. Three. Oh yeah. Okay. Here we go. Let's set it up. It's

1251
04:45:37,270 --> 04:45:57,909
not going to kill that, but it'll kill these things. Okay. Bring it down. It did kill. Wait,

1252
04:45:57,909 --> 04:46:02,470
why did it kill that? Why did it kill the one that has, Oh, cause that's not magic.

1253
04:46:03,189 --> 04:46:14,310
Reduce the cost of your spells or flips a row of tiles. This one. That means I can just do the

1254
04:46:14,310 --> 04:46:25,139
more often. All right. Second boss Bumble versus Gibbs. This thing was kind of shitty, but I don't

1255
04:46:25,139 --> 04:46:31,450
want to get cocky. I'm trying to use this. No, not yet. All right. Oh, what do I want to do? Big,

1256
04:46:31,450 --> 04:46:49,689
big moves, big moves, big moves. Oh, that's extra more tiles bones. All right. Bingo. Good game.

1257
04:47:01,900 --> 04:47:09,700
Hey, what do you know? Splash back attack. That was came in pretty useful. I guess

1258
04:47:15,720 --> 04:47:33,979
may gain movement or enemies may take damage moving. Probably the battery, right? Okay. 21.

1259
04:47:33,979 --> 04:47:44,740
What do we got? The spell costs less. Which one remove tile and throw or add more of a selected

1260
04:47:44,740 --> 04:47:54,330
tile? Probably this one, the movement one with the piss. This is very difficult. This one are you,

1261
04:47:54,330 --> 04:48:00,569
but I can only do this once. I think it's this one. That'll be two, man. The marker.

1262
04:48:04,139 --> 04:48:11,849
Imagine how many times I'd be able to use this probably twice in one turn.

1263
04:48:13,770 --> 04:48:23,560
It'd be two and three. It'd be two and three. Okay. We're going to go marker. Spell hurts more.

1264
04:48:24,200 --> 04:48:47,880
Not worth it. Re-roll the spell. Splash back, but I'm going to use bones for this. It's too expensive.

1265
04:48:48,520 --> 04:48:59,959
Well, I'm going to get one of them. Spell hurt more on one. I thought that was, I thought I

1266
04:48:59,959 --> 04:49:20,700
couldn't do that. All right. Puzzle damage up. Oh, fuck. Are we certain that this doesn't work?

1267
04:49:21,340 --> 04:49:26,139
That's really good. I just, I'm just going to do it to splash back then.

1268
04:49:27,180 --> 04:49:39,509
Why would I not going to re-roll the spell? What just happened? How many times has that happened?

1269
04:49:43,189 --> 04:49:46,869
Okay. That's the third time in a row that I've re-rolled something into the same number that

1270
04:49:46,869 --> 04:49:59,450
it was already. Damn it. How is that even possible? One coin. Let's go. See if I can beat this.

1271
04:50:01,130 --> 04:50:05,049
You increase the damage, not re-rolled. Oh, but why does it still say two?

1272
04:50:05,930 --> 04:50:14,180
That's because I re-rolled the damage to two. Damage went from two to two.

1273
04:50:15,349 --> 04:50:22,470
All right. This is important. This is the one I got to win. We need better music than this.

1274
04:50:22,470 --> 04:50:28,279
Something a little more upbeat, but not too upbeat that I'm going to get nervous.

1275
04:50:34,790 --> 04:50:46,970
Insane aquarium OST. No, that'll drive people crazy. WWE entrance music. I like it. Okay. WWF

1276
04:50:46,970 --> 04:51:00,040
entrance music. These are, well, no, these are all the VODs. Yeah, this is bad. I can't do that.

1277
04:51:03,419 --> 04:51:08,459
Goodbye VOD viewers. I can't do that. Binding of Isaac OST.

1278
04:51:10,619 --> 04:51:26,520
Kata Mario. We just did that two days in a row. Not Banjo Kazooie. Metal Slug? Now that's one.

1279
04:51:26,520 --> 04:51:45,000
Metal Slug OST. Good choice. All right. Move one. We're going to throw. We're going to do,

1280
04:51:46,520 --> 04:51:50,200
I say we're going to go up with the, I don't know. I have no idea. Can you play for me?

1281
04:51:55,500 --> 04:52:06,860
What? Wait, what? Was this me going like what? Turn on the clicks? No, no, no, no.

1282
04:52:07,419 --> 04:52:11,639
Here we go. Watch this. This is, might be a, this might be a poor decision, but I'm going for it.

1283
04:52:11,639 --> 04:52:18,099
I don't care. Don't fuck it up. I want the more tiles because we're going to do

1284
04:52:19,299 --> 04:52:33,750
teeth. Set us up. It's set up and I get to drop poop right here. Oh, what's that? Look at me.

1285
04:52:34,470 --> 04:52:57,290
That's fine. All right. Now bone. Uh, yeah. Bone into, or should I slow?

1286
04:52:58,090 --> 04:53:03,369
Maybe I'll drop a poo over here just to be safe. I've looked at how many moves I have. Holy fuck.

1287
04:53:13,930 --> 04:53:18,810
Uh, I can't, I have to kill you with the spell. So let me get some bones and some teeth. I just

1288
04:53:18,810 --> 04:53:33,430
need bones and that's, I mean, I can't even hurt you. So let's throw a puzzle at you. Let's get

1289
04:53:33,430 --> 04:53:47,349
rid of, uh, over here. There you go. Now I kind of just have to wait until you open. Uh, should I

1290
04:53:47,349 --> 04:53:58,090
just, oh, how am I supposed to do? Okay. Add more, um, bones or teeth. Okay. Now just set up seven,

1291
04:53:58,090 --> 04:54:11,619
just set up seven of them. I can take as long as I want. Set up seven hearts. I can't do that.

1292
04:54:14,790 --> 04:54:20,360
Do hearts instead. I'm actually wondering if we should just farm hearts right now.

1293
04:54:20,840 --> 04:54:39,930
All right. Well, I can't, I'm, no, I can't. He's dead. Use the marker, but I, I, next time.

1294
04:54:40,650 --> 04:55:02,459
Poopy morph attack or gain gray mana. This is, wait, this is not even original metal slug.

1295
04:55:02,459 --> 04:55:10,680
Where's metal, where's original metal slug? Oh, this is like a compilation. All right. Look,

1296
04:55:10,680 --> 04:55:17,849
this is original metal slug is right here. There we go. Okay. Here's original metal slug. Okay. Um,

1297
04:55:18,729 --> 04:55:34,360
I wonder which one of these is even worth doing. Poop, maybe the poopy morph attack and take it.

1298
04:55:34,360 --> 04:55:37,959
No, but what do I want to get rid of? I just upgraded this, didn't I? No, I didn't.

1299
04:55:38,759 --> 04:55:50,599
Get rid of splashback. I don't think I'm taking it. No, how should I not take anything?

1300
04:55:51,400 --> 04:55:58,389
Splashback might be good later. No, I'm not going to take it. How do I just get out of this?

1301
04:55:59,349 --> 04:56:13,930
I don't think I can leave. I can't cancel. I'll replace splashback. That's a little too much

1302
04:56:13,930 --> 04:56:24,580
because I'm going to be using it for tiles. What are these guys? I don't know what these guys do.

1303
04:56:25,299 --> 04:56:34,979
Okay. We're looking for, first of all, very important, get the P. What do I want more of?

1304
04:56:35,619 --> 04:56:45,849
They have a double move. All right. Let's do poo then. Right down the middle.

1305
04:56:46,650 --> 04:56:51,130
And then let's get, I want to add more bones.

1306
04:56:56,020 --> 04:57:19,860
Fuck. Didn't want to do that. Didn't want that to happen. Oh, fuck. Maybe I did. Ooh.

1307
04:57:19,860 --> 04:57:28,330
Play this whole row. Another move. This is four damage. All right. Keep clearing it.

1308
04:57:29,290 --> 04:57:35,319
I'm all right with this. Can I kill this guy without doing anything? Let's see if I can kill

1309
04:57:35,319 --> 04:57:52,220
him. Okay. Let's add more teeth. That should be enough to at least move a little bit.

1310
04:57:52,939 --> 04:58:05,400
Get rid of the boogers. Beat him with a zero. Remove boogers now. All right.

1311
04:58:05,959 --> 04:58:24,979
Okay. This is a lot. I need to slow down. I have way too many teeth. Three. If I move,

1312
04:58:26,419 --> 04:58:32,380
I'm just going to keep this rolling. All right. Now I'm going to get hearts.

1313
04:58:33,990 --> 04:58:59,799
Do poopy mouth. Not yet. I'm just going to keep killing shit. Okay. Hearts. Now let's do tile

1314
04:58:59,799 --> 04:59:08,069
remove on this one on the bone. No, let's do this one. Just whip it right down the middle

1315
04:59:09,110 --> 04:59:21,080
and then do it again. I'm going to do it to this. I don't have any idea what I'm doing right now.

1316
04:59:21,080 --> 04:59:31,930
How about the poop over here or the bone? Okay. I don't know. All right. One, two, three, four,

1317
04:59:31,930 --> 04:59:49,740
five, six, seven hearts. Seven of them. Don't screw it up. This needs to move. This needs to move.

1318
04:59:54,950 --> 05:00:11,500
Oh, hold on. I, I, this is wrong for me. How do I get this to be right? Uh, it's, it's almost,

1319
05:00:11,500 --> 05:00:20,139
it's close. Kind of. Just take your time. Okay. And then this is going to come over here.

1320
05:00:22,979 --> 05:00:40,869
I'm just going to take my time. Yeah. I only take my time. Now why do I have one move? Okay.

1321
05:00:41,349 --> 05:00:56,099
Now this is, I need three over here. So move you here and then it's close. So now I go up,

1322
05:00:56,099 --> 05:01:02,020
up, up, and then I can move that one to the left. One more on the bottom. What do you mean?

1323
05:01:05,450 --> 05:01:29,180
Move wild to the middle with the spell. I see you Sam. There we go. All of this just to get an

1324
05:01:29,180 --> 05:01:50,150
extra soul heart. I hope it was worth it. Here we go. Cool. Cool. All right. Now, uh, whatever. Just

1325
05:01:50,869 --> 05:02:10,680
got to hit it once. Another move. I just need to kill it. Just who cares? No, I want to try and

1326
05:02:10,680 --> 05:02:21,619
bring this up. Dead. All right. Now I have two hearts. I think I have one more room and then

1327
05:02:21,619 --> 05:02:30,250
that's the boss after this. I already have a good scenario here for a, I got already. Already.

1328
05:02:30,889 --> 05:02:43,159
Bring this one down. Bring this one down. Already. I can fucking care less. Whatever you guys do.

1329
05:02:43,799 --> 05:03:00,549
Good night. And hell yeah. All right. Don't blow it. Destroy a row of tiles or plus three movement

1330
05:03:00,549 --> 05:03:08,490
and a random mana. That's the one. Yeah. I, what do I replace it? I'm going to, yeah. The heart's gone.

1331
05:03:09,130 --> 05:03:19,669
Why is the heart gone? What happened to the heart? They exploded? No, it was the fly.

1332
05:03:20,470 --> 05:03:25,459
All right. We'll have a mega battery and I'm going to, we're going to just get rid of the pot.

1333
05:03:25,459 --> 05:03:33,380
Put the morph attack. That's it. All right. Bumbo versus pyre matching specific color tiles is the

1334
05:03:33,380 --> 05:03:47,000
key. All right. I need to match yellow battery right off the bat. I think I'm doing battery

1335
05:03:47,000 --> 05:03:56,819
both these right off the bat. Okay. I have a lot of time to think about this. So we need to do

1336
05:03:56,819 --> 05:04:14,869
yellow tiles. Do seven P. Is that possible right now? I could go here. This is going to

1337
05:04:14,869 --> 05:04:20,659
take a lot of movement here. No, I'm not going to go for it. We're just going to do one, two.

1338
05:04:30,680 --> 05:04:45,479
Now what? Now is he hurt? Add more of his, all right. Is this, is this teeth? Okay. Um, hold on.

1339
05:04:45,479 --> 05:04:56,869
Now he's hurt. Teeth. How many teeth do I have? Seven teeth. Let's go. I can do one, two, three,

1340
05:04:56,869 --> 05:05:14,759
one, two, three. No, hold on. Do this first. Okay. Okay. Crush him. Ooh, that one stings.

1341
05:05:16,409 --> 05:05:32,139
All right. Hold on. More of what? Poop? More boogers, more bones. Hold on because I need to

1342
05:05:32,139 --> 05:05:41,479
make sure I'm protected. If I get hit once or twice, I'm dead. Bones. Okay. All right. Let's do it.

1343
05:05:44,380 --> 05:05:47,259
Not a great position, but it's enough for me to at least, let's see,

1344
05:05:50,259 --> 05:06:09,740
if I go, I'm going to have to do one and then can I do seven? Can I? I have two moves. Okay. I could

1345
05:06:09,740 --> 05:06:21,540
do bang, bang. Is that enough? This down, down. This is it? No, it's not. Use the spell to move

1346
05:06:21,540 --> 05:06:44,970
it once. Down, down. That's it. Where is it?

1347
05:07:01,689 --> 05:07:03,209
That character is really powerful.

1348
05:07:03,849 --> 05:07:12,250
Trap door under Bumbo. What do you think? More bigger coin? More better trash?

1349
05:07:12,250 --> 05:07:17,369
Even more bigger coin? That reminds me of Azazel. Original Azazel.

1350
05:07:27,240 --> 05:07:44,330
And the basement has been unlocked. The trap door. Let me see. Did I unlock anybody else?

1351
05:07:45,049 --> 05:07:49,319
Bumble the brave. Bumble the nimble. Bumble the stout. Bumble the weird.

1352
05:07:50,119 --> 05:08:07,509
Beat the game with the weird. How come I don't get this character? Do I have to beat it with

1353
05:08:07,509 --> 05:08:20,900
the fourth floor? You didn't beat the basement with Bumble the weird. You just moved the goalpost

1354
05:08:20,900 --> 05:08:35,740
forward. Hurry up and speed run it. There's a door there now? Yeah. So did I just do the

1355
05:08:35,740 --> 05:08:41,979
equivalent of you beat mom like five times or whatever? And now the video game starts?

1356
05:08:43,419 --> 05:08:53,000
Yeah, that's fucking awesome. That's cool. Only 20 more times did you get the real ending.

1357
05:08:53,799 --> 05:09:06,950
Except it's not that much more content yet. I think it's fun. Does it have the staying power

1358
05:09:06,950 --> 05:09:21,479
or something like Binding of Isaac? Probably not, but it is a cool little game. He hates it? No,

1359
05:09:21,479 --> 05:09:27,909
I think it's great. I don't think I'm gonna do... I mean, I would probably play this.

1360
05:09:28,869 --> 05:09:50,060
It's early access? Are you sure? It's not early access. No, this is released. This is definitely

1361
05:09:50,060 --> 05:09:53,340
one of those games that you just kind of play when you're just chilling like we've done today.

1362
05:09:53,900 --> 05:10:00,470
I would play the fuck out of this on my iPad. Oh, I would too. I mean, that's coming. That's coming

1363
05:10:00,470 --> 05:10:09,669
soon. Soon as in who knows how long that'll take. I know it's supposed to be coming on the Switch

1364
05:10:09,669 --> 05:10:21,450
or something, but I think it was pretty good. Yeah, that's another thing. Another really important

1365
05:10:21,450 --> 05:10:30,299
thing to remember about this game. When Binding of Isaac released just 1.0, it didn't have the

1366
05:10:30,939 --> 05:10:41,990
thousand plus items that are in it now. I'm sure that over the years there'll probably be at least

1367
05:10:41,990 --> 05:10:49,540
a couple of major additions to it. It was on Newgrounds in 2008 with two floors. Yeah,

1368
05:10:51,209 --> 05:11:05,580
I think it's great. I think it's 13... it's like 14 bucks. I think it's worth your time, but this

1369
05:11:05,580 --> 05:11:10,380
isn't a free game on Newgrounds. No, I think it's worth it. I think it's worth like the 13, 14 dollars.

1370
05:11:11,909 --> 05:11:14,950
I mean, I've been playing this game for over five hours now and it's...

1371
05:11:18,169 --> 05:11:22,729
there's still more to do. It's still... it's a game that you're just supposed to play through

1372
05:11:22,729 --> 05:11:46,599
like 30, 40 times in a row. We'll see. But you didn't. Well, not yet. It's got bad Steam reviews.

1373
05:11:48,250 --> 05:11:52,970
It's kind of mixed, I guess. People are mad about the bugs that were there last week.

1374
05:11:56,150 --> 05:12:00,069
I mean, that's completely understandable. If the game crashes in the middle of your run,

1375
05:12:00,069 --> 05:12:11,000
that's kind of... that sucks. But once they patch it a bunch of times and it's the game that

1376
05:12:11,000 --> 05:12:13,959
kind of, I guess, should have released a week or a half ago or so, a week ago.

1377
05:12:14,759 --> 05:12:23,270
I would say if you want to wait till... I mean, it's 10% off right now.

1378
05:12:24,810 --> 05:12:31,930
If you like what you saw, then you liked what you saw. I think it's an interesting mechanic.

1379
05:12:31,930 --> 05:12:38,630
Did he get softlocked? Yeah, I got softlocked. I had to go back to the very first save file

1380
05:12:38,630 --> 05:12:46,840
in Dead Rising 2. Is this a sponsored stream? Why the hell would I do a sponsored Bumbo stream?

1381
05:12:52,700 --> 05:13:02,889
Hey, yeah. Bye, guys. My first ever sponsored stream. It's Bumbo. No, I think it was cute. It

1382
05:13:02,889 --> 05:13:08,330
was fun. It was interesting. It's taken a long time. But I mean, it's only like a handful of

1383
05:13:08,330 --> 05:13:13,880
people that are working on this. I thought it was good. I liked it. And I'm going to play it

1384
05:13:13,880 --> 05:13:24,090
another time. Not on stream. I'm going to play it on my own. But, guys... No, no, no, don't say it.

1385
05:13:24,090 --> 05:13:30,650
Don't say it. Don't say it. Guys, don't say it. Oh, no, no. It's only been five and a half hours.

1386
05:13:30,650 --> 05:13:45,720
Don't say it. Guys, I have to go. No, but why? Why do you have to go? What? No. Dude, come on.

1387
05:13:45,720 --> 05:14:00,759
I am going to go start working on the lazy fuck sultan. What is that? What the fuck? Oh,

1388
05:14:00,759 --> 05:14:11,930
come on. What does that even mean? Liar. All right, let me explain for those of you that

1389
05:14:11,930 --> 05:14:19,130
are not sure what I'm talking about here. In the probably the second week of December,

1390
05:14:20,819 --> 05:14:28,099
I'm going to have a series of streams where I have an enormous Minecraft server.

1391
05:14:28,919 --> 05:14:32,659
That's probably going to be the first one. And it's going to be...

1392
05:14:33,459 --> 05:14:41,580
Fuck the king. I am going to rule over a kingdom with hopefully potentially hundreds and hundreds

1393
05:14:41,580 --> 05:14:50,119
of slots on a server. It's going to be a kind of slightly RP kind of scenario where if I die,

1394
05:14:51,740 --> 05:15:00,490
it's over. The king's dead. I am going to collect taxes on you. I'm going to have bodyguards.

1395
05:15:04,580 --> 05:15:10,139
Good luck. There's going to be an aging system, hopefully, if we can get it coded,

1396
05:15:12,229 --> 05:15:18,229
where you if you so people can't just turtle, you know, like five hours in game or 10 hours

1397
05:15:18,229 --> 05:15:26,360
in actual game is like you die. You're dead. He thinks the guards will protect him. I think they

1398
05:15:26,360 --> 05:15:31,479
will. Oh, they will because they're going to be all trusted. Very, very highly trusted people.

1399
05:15:31,479 --> 05:15:38,069
I'm going to be surrounded by them. There will be grievances with the kingdom. I will usually be

1400
05:15:38,069 --> 05:15:49,020
expected to make statues of me. Oh, there'll be consequences. There's a lot going on that it's

1401
05:15:49,020 --> 05:15:53,779
going to be a hopefully it's going to be a lot of fun. And that's not it. There's going to be

1402
05:15:54,900 --> 05:16:01,459
there's an this is kind of a series of like the streamers of fucking egomaniac because as we go

1403
05:16:01,459 --> 05:16:09,220
forward with other games in that sort of open no goal RP style, I want to do this where I don't

1404
05:16:09,220 --> 05:16:14,819
do anything. I physically do not play the game and thousands of you just just play the game for

1405
05:16:14,819 --> 05:16:22,650
me. I want like 50 diamond blocks and you just bring them to me and I just sit there and we have

1406
05:16:22,650 --> 05:16:26,729
like cameras that are observers that are going around seeing how people are doing.

1407
05:16:32,250 --> 05:16:35,930
If I'm unhappy, like I'll just make I'll call a court and we'll decide what we're going to do.

1408
05:16:36,569 --> 05:16:42,729
You need to protect me. I'll have loyal I'll pay I'll pay in like in game money. We'll have like

1409
05:16:42,729 --> 05:16:46,490
try to have like an in game currency of like have like mercenaries to protect me and protect the

1410
05:16:46,490 --> 05:17:03,099
kingdom. But there's a lot that needs to go into it and I want to start working on it and get it

1411
05:17:03,099 --> 05:17:10,549
solid because I need to like buy servers. I need to hire some coders. I've been talking to

1412
05:17:11,750 --> 05:17:16,389
people like producers for this to try to help get cameras and observer cameras and

1413
05:17:16,389 --> 05:17:19,349
it's going to be a whole thing and it's probably going to be like a four or five week series.

1414
05:17:20,069 --> 05:17:23,349
We'll do it like once a week with probably potentially maybe one or two in Minecraft,

1415
05:17:23,349 --> 05:17:29,099
one or two in like Conan Exiles. We're just throwing them. We're just it's in the phase

1416
05:17:29,099 --> 05:17:34,279
right now we're trying to figure it out. But I definitely want to have a the lazy king sucks

1417
05:17:34,840 --> 05:17:50,259
stream at least probably four or five of them. But I will see you guys in a couple days. We will

1418
05:17:50,259 --> 05:17:55,139
start. I don't know what we're going to start because there's like this Star Wars which I was

1419
05:17:55,139 --> 05:18:01,939
like eh. There's like Outer Worlds where I'm like eh. There's PlayStation 1 where I'm like

1420
05:18:01,939 --> 05:18:15,419
eh. I'm trying there's a bunch of stuff I could pull from. 200 people are going to just bum rush

1421
05:18:15,419 --> 05:18:21,380
you. Well that's I'm going to do you guys don't think that I'm going to have plans? What am I

1422
05:18:21,380 --> 05:18:28,439
just yeah sure you're going to build a ladder and climb up to my tower into my window like I said

1423
05:18:28,439 --> 05:18:32,279
the other day with like an axe in your hand. You don't think I'm going to have sentries just people

1424
05:18:32,279 --> 05:18:39,290
ready? Oh did you pay that sentry in the in-game currency to like look the other way? Oh that's

1425
05:18:39,290 --> 05:18:43,959
fine. I've got somebody in the bedroom that's standing there at the window ready for you and

1426
05:18:43,959 --> 05:18:53,110
he's paid way more than you could ever pay. You don't think I'm going to have like a series of

1427
05:18:53,110 --> 05:18:59,540
like 30 different tunnels built privately that I'm going to get I can always escape and bring like

1428
05:18:59,540 --> 05:19:06,259
30 of my most loyal men and women and we then oh then what then you're going to take over the

1429
05:19:06,259 --> 05:19:13,259
castle oh yeah you are don't think so and I'm going to be a good king I'm not going to be mean

1430
05:19:13,259 --> 05:19:18,619
to you at least unless you don't mean if you don't do what I say then then come on I'm the king.

1431
05:19:23,860 --> 05:19:30,979
He's going to be you're going to be Lord Farquaad. Somebody said this the other day I've been laughing

1432
05:19:30,979 --> 05:19:36,900
about it ever since. It's like everyone has you build up your houses we have like a series of

1433
05:19:36,900 --> 05:19:45,500
houses and people populate them and role play and walk around and give bring me things and like

1434
05:19:45,500 --> 05:19:50,220
somebody just pulls out an enchanted arrow and shoots me in the fucking head during one of these

1435
05:19:50,220 --> 05:19:55,180
like tell me your grievances and I'm instantly dead it's over and it's like all the work was for

1436
05:19:55,180 --> 05:20:01,639
nothing but that makes me laugh so I don't care. You're going to get like we're going to check

1437
05:20:01,639 --> 05:20:05,959
your items to see what you have you can't come into the throne room with like an enchanted bow

1438
05:20:06,040 --> 05:20:17,770
what am I going to let that happen there's going to be metal detectors that you have to go through

1439
05:20:17,770 --> 05:20:30,470
before you come to the throne room but anyways once an idea pops like into my brain and the

1440
05:20:30,470 --> 05:20:36,470
original idea for those of you that weren't here was WoW Classic where I didn't want to play WoW

1441
05:20:36,470 --> 05:20:41,669
Classic because I was grilled about hey why the fuck didn't you make the guild you should have

1442
05:20:41,669 --> 05:20:45,349
made that guild that you promised and I said I got to level seven and quit the game because I was

1443
05:20:45,349 --> 05:20:49,590
stupid I didn't like it right I don't want to do this again I want to play WoW Classic again

1444
05:20:49,590 --> 05:20:55,590
right I was going to make a guild and then it was like well if I play WoW Classic anyways people

1445
05:20:55,590 --> 05:20:59,830
are just going to be like a hundred people around me just like all bringing me shit and like killing

1446
05:20:59,830 --> 05:21:03,560
each other and I was like I'm not going to play the game I was walking around like looking at

1447
05:21:03,560 --> 05:21:08,900
stuff and then I was like all right well fucking I'll do it and if I if I die then streams over

1448
05:21:08,900 --> 05:21:12,180
and then it was like okay well that's incentive for people to like protect me and then people

1449
05:21:12,180 --> 05:21:17,819
to kill me and then it's like all right fucking I'm not gonna do anything I want to give I want

1450
05:21:17,819 --> 05:21:22,299
like 50,000 gold and like all the best bounce in the game and if I'm hurt I get the streams over

1451
05:21:22,299 --> 05:21:30,709
and then it's kind of just piled on top of that decided maybe WoW is probably not the best idea

1452
05:21:30,709 --> 05:21:42,919
it might still be funny to do that as one of the one of the weeks we'll see five minute stream

1453
05:21:42,919 --> 05:21:47,720
once a week well that wouldn't be the only thing I'd be doing that would just be like you know

1454
05:21:47,720 --> 05:21:53,319
Saturday night is the fuck the king you know what I mean that's like what we do on like Saturdays

1455
05:21:53,319 --> 05:22:09,159
for a few weeks fuck the king friday I just see all these scenarios where I'm like trying to escape

1456
05:22:09,159 --> 05:22:13,560
from my tunnel like okay we get overrun this castle gets taken okay they've risen up and

1457
05:22:13,560 --> 05:22:19,319
they've taken over and I go through one of my tunnels and I I like pop out I have to like dig

1458
05:22:19,319 --> 05:22:24,119
up because like I'm sorry it's like five of my loyal bodyguards and we're like fucking escaping

1459
05:22:24,119 --> 05:22:28,360
and I dig up and I'm like I got we get stuck and get lost and there's like a hundred people

1460
05:22:28,360 --> 05:22:39,340
surrounding me like me pop my head like a like a prairie dog you don't think I'm gonna have like

1461
05:22:39,340 --> 05:22:49,209
fucking dragons and shit good luck or you could just be civil and just we could be in the kingdom

1462
05:22:49,209 --> 05:23:03,560
and who cares I don't need to die but that's it we're gonna probably try to come up with

1463
05:23:04,360 --> 05:23:12,020
some incentives to why I would not be dead you know why why protect me what would you what do

1464
05:23:12,020 --> 05:23:20,540
you gain from that spitballing ideas for that sounds fun and then there's like other factions

1465
05:23:20,540 --> 05:23:25,259
that arise of people that want to take over they might even be fighting between the viewers

1466
05:23:25,900 --> 05:23:40,979
and I have nothing to do with it I step in I'm just like trying to like correct it music oh shit

1467
05:23:42,040 --> 05:23:45,240
but that was legend bumble I just want to play it for a few hours and end up playing it for more

1468
05:23:45,240 --> 05:23:53,319
than five I think it's very fun you let me lie in bed with that and I'll play it every night

1469
05:23:53,319 --> 05:24:12,779
for at least a few weeks any interest in halo reach when it comes out yeah I'm gonna probably

1470
05:24:12,779 --> 05:24:17,380
play all of them that seems like a really just fun thing to do because I've never played any of

1471
05:24:17,380 --> 05:24:29,080
the halo games that just seems like a no-brainer but let's go back to five and a half hours ago

1472
05:24:29,080 --> 05:24:36,599
we had martin had a meme gave a thousand bits thank you martin germa you got a nice looking

1473
05:24:36,599 --> 05:24:43,459
bumbo haha just kidding thanks to the thousand bits appreciate it by the way for those of you

1474
05:24:43,459 --> 05:25:02,900
wondering I will be back on uh Thursday Thursday afternoon pepe hands he hates us

1475
05:25:04,180 --> 05:25:10,009
you guys go right to that every single time I had a lot of fun today you guys it was fun thanks for

1476
05:25:10,009 --> 05:25:17,060
helping me it's just that's it was just chill it was just fun it was stressful sometimes but that

1477
05:25:17,060 --> 05:25:30,330
was just fun I'm gonna play more puzzle games with you guys no but thank you seriously to martin had

1478
05:25:30,330 --> 05:25:38,540
a meme for a thousand bits appreciate it peaceful hailey thanks for the 250 germa how are you I'm

1479
05:25:38,540 --> 05:25:42,549
doing pretty good uh I want to ask you a question maybe it might be dumb but I guess I just kind of

1480
05:25:42,549 --> 05:25:47,029
want to know do you ever think about your view count while streaming like if it goes below a

1481
05:25:47,029 --> 05:25:52,810
certain number does it bother you anyways hope you're well have a good night no not at all

1482
05:25:55,849 --> 05:26:06,389
the view count on this stream fluctuates huge because if there's a big event stream you know

1483
05:26:06,389 --> 05:26:10,150
let's say like once a month some months every like 30 to 40 days there's like oh wow there's

1484
05:26:10,150 --> 05:26:16,150
an event like the halloween stream or the carnival or the green screen stuff I mean they might be

1485
05:26:17,270 --> 05:26:22,700
eight ten twelve thousand people concurrently watching those streams and that's awesome but

1486
05:26:22,700 --> 05:26:28,200
yeah I can't I can't expect that that's not that's not gonna happen every time I also do like yeah

1487
05:26:28,200 --> 05:26:32,919
somebody just said that was my next point I play and do so many different things on this stream

1488
05:26:33,639 --> 05:26:41,080
every single time that there's no way it would be the same amount of people every time

1489
05:26:41,959 --> 05:26:50,580
like for like today right I mean this still there's still a lot of people here

1490
05:26:51,299 --> 05:26:56,020
but the dude the people that don't want to watch me play like a match for bumbo game

1491
05:26:56,580 --> 05:27:02,099
you know they'll just kind of take off whatever I think any genre any game it doesn't really I

1492
05:27:02,099 --> 05:27:06,979
don't care about like genres and what the exact game I'm playing is I don't really have like that

1493
05:27:06,979 --> 05:27:14,470
anchor video game where it's like hey guys two or three times a week I'm gonna play overwatch or

1494
05:27:14,470 --> 05:27:24,250
dota or something right there's not that anchor video game that I play every day or every week

1495
05:27:24,250 --> 05:27:31,990
so I can't let a view count get into my head for any reason because there's no it's these streams

1496
05:27:31,990 --> 05:27:37,740
are just kind of all over the place by design so how could I expect people to be that the views

1497
05:27:37,740 --> 05:27:47,209
are gonna fluctuate all the time so no that does not bother me at all that is I mean we make jokes

1498
05:27:47,209 --> 05:27:51,610
sometimes like oh all right well how many people just left 500 people just left because I said that

1499
05:27:51,610 --> 05:28:00,139
but it's all just bullshit and I'm just fucking around you guys know that but no it doesn't I

1500
05:28:00,139 --> 05:28:08,970
don't really think about it that much at all show it's we're begging you to show auto he's sleeping

1501
05:28:08,970 --> 05:28:19,340
in the other room I mean if you think I care about view counts I do you really think I would be

1502
05:28:19,340 --> 05:28:24,299
laughing as hard as I am sometimes about how bugleberry dropped two to three thousand

1503
05:28:24,299 --> 05:28:32,659
concurrent viewers on the halloween stream I that that like it made me laugh I wasn't like oh fuck

1504
05:28:32,740 --> 05:28:46,500
no my views that's like it's all right I get it I get it but I hope that answers your question

1505
05:28:46,500 --> 05:28:54,459
kind of long-winded but hopefully it answers what you were asking hey bob boy you get five

1506
05:28:54,459 --> 05:29:03,000
gifted subs I didn't even see it thanks bob boy it was the echo in the sound I know that makes

1507
05:29:03,000 --> 05:29:08,200
it so much worse but funnier is like the sound was so un-fucking-bearable that if people just

1508
05:29:08,840 --> 05:29:17,779
I can't listen as I'm fucking leaving and I did the loudest noise I've ever done on a stream

1509
05:29:18,759 --> 05:29:21,400
it's just there's so many reasons why people would leave

1510
05:29:24,659 --> 05:29:38,380
whatever it's all good it just makes me laugh but thank you thank you ball boy ball boy with

1511
05:29:38,380 --> 05:29:44,380
the five subs and 1500 bits half-life alex was just announced as the flagship vr title by valve

1512
05:29:44,380 --> 05:29:49,259
I hope it's thank you for the 1500 bits by the way but I do hope it's actually a video game I do

1513
05:29:49,259 --> 05:29:55,340
I really hope like I said earlier I hope this is not a tech demo for a new peripheral that's like

1514
05:29:55,340 --> 05:30:00,540
an hour and 10 minutes I hope this is a real game like a flagship actual full vr video game

1515
05:30:01,659 --> 05:30:10,979
it's supposed to be a full game but is it a full vr game because most full vr games are like two to

1516
05:30:10,979 --> 05:30:16,259
three hours it's 12 to 16 hours you gotta be kidding me okay well then that's awesome I'm

1517
05:30:16,259 --> 05:30:25,369
glad that that's now a known thing it's 12 to 15 hours it's not a tech demo for new tech it's a

1518
05:30:25,369 --> 05:30:32,520
demo for old tech they haven't confirmed anything yet all right well I'm gonna my hands I'm just

1519
05:30:32,520 --> 05:30:38,069
gonna pull my hands back and just not just be like okay whatever it ends up being I hope it's very

1520
05:30:38,069 --> 05:30:47,049
good because it has been a very long damn time since valve actually made a video game yes artifact

1521
05:30:47,049 --> 05:31:11,299
came out but did it though like I it came out yes it released but and then I know but uh they've

1522
05:31:11,299 --> 05:31:21,319
made a couple of games but if you love artifact and you like it then I'm glad you do but I would

1523
05:31:21,319 --> 05:31:35,619
have much rathered something else than card game number like 30 no one does any artifact fans here

1524
05:31:36,659 --> 05:31:45,419
click on the link all right yeah why what's why am I naked what I'm not that hairy what's with the

1525
05:31:45,419 --> 05:31:55,400

to get like one or two under the belt to make sure it's like even going to be something that's fun

1549
05:34:47,799 --> 05:34:57,189
it's an experiment that we're going to do so we'll get one under the belt maybe two and then

1550
05:34:57,189 --> 05:35:10,200
we'll start to potentially see if anybody else wants to do it but yes there's that is a thought

1551
05:35:10,200 --> 05:35:19,639
absolutely hey dark soul thanks for the 250 I said I wasn't going to donate bits for now but your

1552
05:35:19,639 --> 05:35:26,490
letter was very convincing anyways please play metroid prime one through three on stream and

1553
05:35:26,490 --> 05:35:41,509
I won't have to eat my game cube thank you imagine you imagine a streamer doesn't play

1554
05:35:41,509 --> 05:35:52,700
metroid prime one in like a week so you fucking eat your game cube who's there it's just what

1555
05:35:52,700 --> 05:36:00,169
you're just doing it in your room ah shit he didn't play it yeah I gotta go eat the game cube now

1556
05:36:00,169 --> 05:36:06,150
how do you eat a game cube do you just melt it down the plastic and then just drink it

1557
05:36:15,750 --> 05:36:19,270
that's an interesting thought those games are supposed to be really good by the way have never

1558
05:36:19,270 --> 05:36:25,689
played any one of them yes I know it's like oh whoa how have you not played metroid prime

1565
05:37:05,959 --> 05:37:11,659
many people stream VR they do but I will there be that many people actually streaming that game

1568
05:37:32,229 --> 05:37:38,520

1569
05:37:38,520 --> 05:37:42,700
they'll do that too I'm gonna scream when I turn around I see something that I didn't know was

1572
05:38:04,169 --> 05:38:12,340

1573
05:38:12,340 --> 05:38:22,659
yes I'll be playing it within three days of it coming out I would say thank you I think I can for

1574
05:38:22,659 --> 05:38:28,650
the thousand bits appreciate it germa you know many other content creators have gotten you know

1575
05:38:29,450 --> 05:38:34,810
you know many hold on I'm speaking strangely germa you know many other content creators have

1576
05:38:34,810 --> 05:38:40,569
gotten me to laugh some of you made me laugh crying but no one has ever made me legitimately

1577
05:38:40,569 --> 05:38:51,130
fear for my life from laughing so hard that it hurt throughout my whole body you uh you're the

1578
05:38:51,130 --> 05:38:54,650
greatest person I've ever watched and I want you to know that I absolutely adore your streams and

1579
05:38:54,650 --> 05:38:59,130
you yourself please keep doing this for as long as physically possible I'm looking forward to

1580
05:38:59,130 --> 05:39:08,819
your retirement home streams that's a that's a incredibly nice thing to say I hope you don't

1581
05:39:08,819 --> 05:39:14,889
end up being killed from laughing at this stream but I will tell you there has actually been three

1582
05:39:14,889 --> 05:39:27,110
or four times where I thought that I was actually in danger the last time it happened was um sims

1583
05:39:27,110 --> 05:39:35,130
four is I mean I was I seriously thought that something bad was going to happen to me and it

1584
05:39:35,130 --> 05:39:39,610
was not what you think it was the dogs the guy doing drugs and walking his dog in his house

1585
05:39:40,740 --> 05:39:50,389
it was so so fucking funny it was unbearably funny and then dogs were like rolling around

1586
05:39:50,389 --> 05:40:00,619
into the pee like why would you put a leash on a dog and then walk the dog in your house

1587
05:40:01,340 --> 05:40:09,799
that you're just so fucked up on drugs okay but the actually the last time recently was in planet

1588
05:40:09,799 --> 05:40:14,360
zoo when I was trying to get the the monkey to climb out of the enclosure and he kept taking

1589
05:40:14,360 --> 05:40:28,409
that way the long way and the alarms would sound I gotta be careful though because

1590
05:40:32,119 --> 05:40:36,439
it's hard if you laugh hard you can like I don't know I'm not even going to get into it but you

1591
05:40:36,439 --> 05:40:44,709
can like I feel like I may have given myself a hernia it's actually one of the things

1592
05:40:45,430 --> 05:40:57,099
that I'm being checked for soon so I mean full transparency here for the medical stuff I'm being

1593
05:40:57,099 --> 05:41:10,889
checked for a hernia I don't know I that's what I was told so it this is not what's happened I'm

1594
05:41:10,889 --> 05:41:17,959
just giving you a scenario that is so strange I don't even know if this is possible but can you

1595
05:41:17,959 --> 05:41:25,799
imagine a scenario where I laughed so hard at the sims 4 drug dog pee thing that I gave myself a

1596
05:41:25,799 --> 05:41:33,270
hernia last year can you imagine how fucking ridiculous that is I don't even know if that's

1597
05:41:33,270 --> 05:41:40,569
medically possible I am speaking totally out of my ass here I'm just saying that's fucking so

1598
05:41:40,569 --> 05:41:54,599
stupid I'm not even sure that that's even how that works but I am like out of all of all the

1599
05:41:54,599 --> 05:42:00,419
things I'm being checked for I've had my liver checked I'm having my throat down the tube into

1600
05:42:00,419 --> 05:42:07,299
my stomach to check for a hernia we're just trying to figure it out why I I I'm fine you know that's

1601
05:42:07,299 --> 05:42:23,900
everything's gonna be fine what a way to go you're gonna go no but I know but that's not even real

1602
05:42:23,900 --> 05:42:31,020
I'm just saying how fucked up would that be I want to make sure that's very clear on the record

1603
05:42:31,020 --> 05:42:40,630
that I have that's a total bullshit thing that I'm just saying so no that's definitely not what

1604
05:42:40,630 --> 05:42:56,900
happened but it'd be wild but anyways uh thank you I think I can for your 2400 bits I really

1605
05:42:56,900 --> 05:43:02,759
appreciate it the second part of your message here is I have an odd number of bits so this is

1606
05:43:02,759 --> 05:43:09,220
a separate message uh still appreciate you though my thoughts and opinions have not changed even in

1607
05:43:09,220 --> 05:43:13,610
the last 20 minutes good thing I didn't say anything in 20 minutes that you started to hate

1608
05:43:13,610 --> 05:43:20,250
me for hope you didn't watch last night's stream where I talked about mayonnaise and fries looking

1609
05:43:20,250 --> 05:43:27,189
forward to the coming of the king if life ever becomes too much I'll just lock myself in a room

1610
05:43:27,189 --> 05:43:33,189
and blast lock myself in a room and blast every germ of video full volume speakers right next to

1611
05:43:33,189 --> 05:43:47,340
my ears I would advise not doing that because you're gonna cause hearing damage but I thank

1612
05:43:47,340 --> 05:43:54,009
you I really appreciate it thanks for the 2400 fucking bits seriously you're gonna give yourself

1613
05:43:54,009 --> 05:44:02,259
an ear hernia thanks a lot thank you silent serenity for the 250 hey jerma if you could put

1614
05:44:02,259 --> 05:44:07,220
your brain in a jar and stream for the rest of eternity would you do it no no I don't want to

1615
05:44:07,220 --> 05:44:18,409
fucking be around forever I would rather you put my brain in a jar and like have me generate

1616
05:44:18,409 --> 05:44:26,700
electricity but hold on do we know if like I'm like like in a nightmare during that scenario

1617
05:44:29,830 --> 05:44:35,740
maybe we'll look into that he's already he already is a brain in a jar don't say that that's scary

1618
05:44:39,139 --> 05:44:46,790
it would be a low wattage now that is a factual statement but I know you're saying that because

1619
05:44:46,790 --> 05:44:53,939
you're saying I'm like stupid so it works both ways but it's not even real because your brain

1620
05:44:53,939 --> 05:44:58,580
guess what would have really low wattage too it wouldn't just be my brain it would be yours too

1621
05:44:58,580 --> 05:45:13,500
you got a low wattage brain too but thank you thank you elizabeth for the 250 you should hit

1622
05:45:13,500 --> 05:45:20,060

05:45:27,590 --> 05:45:34,060
that's trying to kill you is fun on paper I just want to make sure it works in practice before I

1625
05:45:34,060 --> 05:45:37,819
ask it if anybody else is interested to come like have fun and role play on the servers

1626
05:45:38,619 --> 05:45:55,180
just make your character invisible hey vanilla grime thanks for the 500 bits please help I can't

1636
05:47:43,610 --> 05:47:47,459
they said you will go down in medical books as the guy who laughed at a dog rolling around and

1637

pissed so hard that he caused himself permanent damage that was 5000 bits phylactery a fucking

05:48:06,500 --> 05:48:18,979
I'm just making up a scenario watch the clip no I can't I can't ever watch this clip ever again

1640
05:48:39,939 --> 05:48:48,619
it's dude he's it's the dog is doing it so much but the context you have the dog you have to piss

1641
05:48:53,299 --> 05:49:02,860
and make the stars around the guy's head this is the moment that gave him a hernia no I don't even
