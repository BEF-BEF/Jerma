1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,529
Hey, hey, welcome to Gang Beasts, where you punch each other in the fucking face.

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:15,560
This is stupid.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,559
They're kicking the shit out of that dinosaur.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,559
Yeah, what's with the dinosaur, everybody?

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Uh, this game's on Steam right now. It just got into early access.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
This guy, everyone's already dead. He's still punching.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,640
Dude, dude, dude.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
Alright, so, I'm coming.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Don't you dare.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm gonna come to you.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
Get out of here.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,880
What are you doing? You're supposed to fight me on the trunk.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
I don't want to fight you on the trunk.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Well, that's too bad. I'm coming to you.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Get off of this trunk. Get off.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,880
No, Juno.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
You're just tossing you around.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,880
I just close-lined you.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,630
No!

20
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,630
It's not fair. You didn't even knock me off.

21
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,630
Oh, you can get hit by the signs. Do you see that?

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,630
Yes. That's what hit me.

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,630
Alright, well, alright, you come to me this time.

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,629
No, I want to wait for the signs.

25
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,629
I'm a scary monster.

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,370
No, no, wait for the signs.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Shit.

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Alright, wait for the signs. Wait for the signs.

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,090
We will wait for the signs this time.

30
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm just gonna hang out, like, right on the front of the trunk.

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,090
Hi.

32
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,909
This is so stupid.

33
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,909
You do realize one of us is just gonna get...

34
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,909
Whoa! No, shit.

35
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:39,909
Wait for the signs.

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,650
The momentum put me back.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Okay, let's get on the same truck.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,219
Get on the same truck.

39
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,579
And we're waiting for the sign.

40
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,579
Don't wiggle around this time, because we're gonna accidentally kill each other.

41
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,579
I'm not gonna move.

42
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,579
Whoever survives the sign is the true gang beast.

43
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,579
Gang beast.

44
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,019
Survival of the sign.

45
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:07,019
Oh, here it comes.

46
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,020
The road doesn't fork or anything. Where is it telling us to go?

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,020
We're just gonna get double-closed lined here.

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,759
Oh my god, you're still alive?

49
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Help! Help! Help!

50
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,210
I should not have...

51
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,210
Oh, he's still alive.

52
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,210
Help me up! What the hell?

53
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,210
Hold on. I'm gonna get...

54
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,210
I love this game. This game is so dumb.

55
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,710
Alright, I need to figure...

56
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,710
I wanna just figure out how to throw just a punt.

57
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,710
No, no, no, no, no! Seriously, seriously.

58
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,800
That's how you do it.

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Oh, okay, there it is. Yeah, it's left bumper.

60
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah, left bumper puts out one hand.

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Riding the Ferris Wheel.

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Hello? How do I get up?

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,250
How do I jump off this?

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,250
My left hand is stuck in the Ferris Wheel.

65
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,250
Get me off this ride.

66
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,740
I don't wanna be out here anymore.

67
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
Thank you, you saved me.

68
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.

69
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,819
Oh dear.

70
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,819
You wanna fight with me? Okay.

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,819
You want a real fighting arena?

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Come here, you. Come here!

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Get over here.

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Something's happening on the screen.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You're going... No, no, no!

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
What the hell is going on?

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
I don't know how I did that.

78
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm just carrying you.

79
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
No!

80
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,080
I just was picking you up.

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
Alright, I guess...

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Okay, what's why? If you hold down why,

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
you can pick the person up.

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Come here.

85
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,819
Here comes the choke slam.

86
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,819
This really is just like a tug of war.

87
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,819
No, no, no, no!

88
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,819
Get in, get in!

89
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,580
I think I'm winning.

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,580
Why did I lose a point?

91
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,580
Because you died too.

92
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,579
You're not supposed to die at all.

93
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,949
You're gonna get punched in the face.

94
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,689
Whoa, okay.

95
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,689
I've learned my lesson.

96
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,689
You're gonna lose a point?

97
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,689
No, I can get out.

98
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,689
You still lost a point.

99
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,689
Come here.

100
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,689
You dragged me by my hair.

101
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,689
No, no.

102
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,689
Did I go over? You went over.

103
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,689
I'm trying to get away. You're done.

104
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,689
What the fuck is going on? I fell off the edge of the abyss.

105
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,689
Welcome to the abyss, baby.

106
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,689
Alright, it's two and two.

107
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:47,689
That was a terrible idea.

108
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,430
I'm gonna win right now.

109
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Get in!

110
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,430
Get in the meat grinder!

111
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,430
Get in there!

112
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,430
Let go of me!

113
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,430
Let go of my hand, you son of a bitch!

114
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,430
Let me out!

115
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,430
No, no, no.

116
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,430
Get back in there!

117
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,430
No!

118
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,430
You are not getting out!

119
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,430
You're coming in too, then!

120
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,800
What color are you?

121
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm still blue top hat, man.

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,160
I don't think these people are playing.

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,410
Then throw them off.

124
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,410
Come here.

125
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,410
You're going out of here.

126
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,740
You too!

127
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
No!

128
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,740
You can't just hold on to that, it's cheating!

129
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Let go!

130
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,740
You let go. I'm not gonna let go, you have to let go.

131
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
No, you have to let go.

132
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,240
Alright, we're both gonna let go at the same time.

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I actually didn't even mean to let go.

134
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Am I pressing a button right now?

135
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,339
Holy shit!

136
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,339
Yay!

137
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,339
Alright, you know the drill. At the very beginning,

138
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,339
we dump the other guys off the edge.

139
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,339
Yes, because they're absolutely playing this game.

140
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,779
Yeah, look at these two guys playing this game.

141
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,779
No, I wanna throw them!

142
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,779
No, really! Are you serious?

143
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:11,779
We were trying to throw those two off and now we're both...

144
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,779
I've got you, I've got you!

145
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,779
No, I can't do anything. Can I like, crawl?

146
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,779
They're gonna beat us!

147
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,779
No, hold on, I'm doing like the crawl.

148
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,779
Oh god, I let go.

149
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,519
They're just blinking at each other.

150
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,689
They're not gonna do anything.

151
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,319
This is gonna go on forever.

152
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,319
We have to like, end task on the game.

153
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,319
Yeah, we have to end task.

154
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,319
You have to alt F4, because there's no pause.

155
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,319
There's no...

156
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,620
It's 6 o'clock, coming down.

157
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
We've got a train coming, and it's gonna take you

158
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,620
to Boylston.

159
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,620
And now you wanna get on that train.

160
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,620
You wanna make sure you...

161
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,620
Wow, I thought it was coming.

162
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
You need to help me out.

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,790
I don't wanna get hit by this train.

164
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,790
Can you like, reach your hands out and pull me up?

165
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,790
Pull me up!

166
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,790
Yes!

167
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,290
That's awesome!

168
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,550
Oh no!

169
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,550
I'll come save you!

170
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,550
I'll come save you!

171
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,550
Once you see the lights on the train,

172
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,550
that is when we have to try to escape, okay?

173
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,550
Okay, I'm ready.

174
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,550
We have to stand back here.

175
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,920
You have to run for it.

176
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Once the train comes, once you see the lights,

177
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,839
we have to make our way back up to the platform.

178
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,839
And whoever makes it up there wins.
