1
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,410
We're in Sunnydale, California.

2
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,410
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first ever

3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,410
Germa Rumble Live Action.

4
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,410
You know how it works.

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,410
20 contestants enter the ring.

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,409
Every 60 seconds, another competitor is going to come in.

7
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,409
And if you get thrown out of the ring,

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,409
you're out.

9
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,409
Last man standing wins, getting all the glory.

10
00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:40,409
My name is Germa985.

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,409
I will be the host of the festivities tonight.

12
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,409
Thank you for joining us.

13
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,409
The whole event, by the way, is sponsored by Fruit.

14
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,409
Eat it up.

15
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,409
So let's begin the rumble.

16
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,409
Thank you again to our sponsor, Fruit,

17
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,409
for making this all possible, and for giving us that wonderful

18
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:56,409
Fruit table for our contestants to snack on.

19
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,409
And speaking of contestants, here comes the

20
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,409
first contestant.

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:02,710
The Disco Diaper.

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,709
Making his first ever appearance in a Germa

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,709
Wrestling event, as he does his patented

24
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,709
Definitely Not Disco.

25
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,709
Point to the left and point to the right dance.

26
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,709
And wow, listen to that crowd.

27
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,709
They are really behind him right now, and can you really

28
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,709
blame them? This guy bleeds charisma.

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,709
Former tap dance artist, former dance

30
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:20,709
instructor, so he's got it all.

31
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,709
He's got everything you could possibly want in a

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:24,709
competitor.

33
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,709
As he finishes up his entrance, we have the

34
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,709
second competitor coming in, number two.

35
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,709
This is Jay Buffay.

36
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,709
AKA The Wine Guy.

37
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,709
Germa's Grand Theft Auto character.

38
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,709
And look, just smashing a glass.

39
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,709
This is somebody I don't want to be in the ring with.

40
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,709
He is dangerous, he's unpredictable,

41
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,709
and he is incredibly strong.

42
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,709
And with that, we're going to get started here.

43
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,709
Get ready to ring that bell.

44
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,709
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first

45
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,530
Hey! He didn't even ring the bell.

46
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,219
That was disgusting.

47
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,219
That was absolutely deplorable behavior.

48
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:58,219
Inexcusable. What's he have to say for himself?

49
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,219
He's a shit character.

50
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,219
He's calling him a shit character.

51
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,219
And you know, I will have to agree with Jay Buffay here.

52
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,219
He is a shit character.

53
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,219
But that is no excuse for that type of behavior.

54
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,219
We haven't even started the rumble.

55
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,219
And it pains me that our first

56
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,219
fruit, eaten up on the replay, is gonna

57
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,219
have to be of this situation.

58
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,219
Let's break it down here.

59
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,219
Jay Buffay gets into the ring and sneakily comes

60
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,219
behind the Disco Diaper, who is just trying

61
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,219
to have some fun with the crowd and clocks him

62
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,219
right in the back of the skull, hitting him so hard

63
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:28,219
that he punched all the blood out of the

64
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,219
front of his face, something that I didn't think

65
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,219
was even possible until tonight.

66
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,219
As Jay Buffay is

67
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,219
just taunting and gloating, causing

68
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,219
and he just kicked the Disco Diaper while he was down.

69
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,219
What a disgusting, pathetic person.

70
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,219
And he's doing a butt sumo drop on him now.

71
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:44,219
As the next contestant is coming.

72
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:46,219
What is this music? This music is terrible.

73
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,219
Did I pick this music?

74
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,219
Backstage

75
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,219
might potentially be on fire.

76
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,219
I just want to make that very clear. Jerma seems to be pretty

77
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,219
upset about something. And he's here

78
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,219
the three time Jerma Wrestling Federation

79
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,219
Champion is coming in at number three.

80
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,219
We are so excited to have him here. He is a

81
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,219
top seed. Staring down

82
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,219
Jay Buffay. This is an interesting

83
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,219
composition. You have master and

84
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:10,219
creator. And I think we're finally

85
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:12,219
going to get to see some wrestling here in the

86
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,219
first ever Jerma Rumble live action.

87
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,219
Jerma? Jerma's

88
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,219
looking to maybe do a test of strength here with Jay

89
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,219
Buffay. They're going to do it. He's got his

90
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:22,219
right hand here. Jerma is grasping

91
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,219
with his left hand now, showing some

92
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,219
strength. He did mention

93
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,219
Jerma made multiple tweets talking about how

94
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,219
he was going back to the gym. He was getting

95
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:32,219
stronger. He was going to get back into shape.

96
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,219
And it looks like that is absolutely

97
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,219
not the case. Because at this point

98
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,219
he looks like a Pelican Jerry Seinfeld.

99
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,219
As wow he gets pushed back by Jay

100
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,219
Buffay. The strength of Jay. Just tossing

101
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,219
him into those ropes into the corner.

102
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,580
Jerma is yelling into the

103
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,580
audience. I'm not sure what that was for.

104
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
I think he saw something he didn't like while he just

105
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,580
barrels himself out of the corner. And they're back

106
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
in the center of the ring.

107
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,759
Really wish somebody would win this.

108
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,759
As Jay Buffay goes down

109
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,759
on his back. It seems Jerma has the upper hand

110
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,759
now. Can he potentially?

111
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,759
Nope. No. He's going to go on his back.

112
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,759
You know, you could let go of each other's hands.

113
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,759
What a jumping jack there by Jerma. As he gets

114
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,759
back on his feet. And you heard the

115
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,759
buzzer. That means someone else is going to be coming

116
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,759
in here to crowd the ring up. At number

117
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,759
four. The most acclaimed

118
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,759
Demon Slayer of all time.

119
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,000
Carl Griffinstein.

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
From Castle Griffinstein.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Looking very regal.

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wearing his knightly drape.

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And jeans.

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And blue, regular blue sneakers.

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He comes into the ring and gets right

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
in there. He's going right to the disco

127
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
diaper. I'm not sure what he's doing. He still has

128
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
his giant spectral long blade.

129
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Saying some type of prayer.

130
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
While Jerma gets punched. Two punches. Three punches.

131
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wow. He goes right to the gut. Right in Jerma's

132
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
big fat stomach. That's a big target for him.

133
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Jesus. He just

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
stabbed him. He just mercy killed

135
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the disco diaper. He's still unconscious.

136
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who's coming out?

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's Burger Boy. Why is Burger Boy

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
out here right now? He's supposed to wait another 30 seconds

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
before he can come in. I didn't see a countdown.

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But big double clothesline off the top

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
rope. Nonetheless, Burger Boy

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
currently in retirement

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
has come out of retirement to be part of

144
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Germarubble live. Big elbow drop

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
onto Jerma. He is fired up

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and so is this crowd. Following it up

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
with a drop kick. And let's take another look

148
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
at that. The fruit eat it up on the replay.

149
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Burger Boy on the top ropes. Jerma and Jay

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
still holding hands. One of them could

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
have let go. But neither decided

152
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to. And it led to a vicious

153
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
double clothesline off the top rope. Speaking of clothesline

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Jerma gets Carl Griffinstein with one.

155
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And not very much real estate

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
in this ring for anyone

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
to move around.

158
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And it's gonna get much, much

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
worse. Five competitors

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
in the ring were about to add a

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,009
sixth. And here

162
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:48,180
we go.

163
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Waiting in the wings backstage at number six

164
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,639
is Glueman.

165
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,329
Gabe the Glueman

166
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,329
Degrosie. The fourth

167
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:00,329
appearance in Germarubble history.

168
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,329
The original shit character.

169
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,329
And the original superhero.

170
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,329
He's here to prove once and for all

171
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,329
that he can take on any piece of shit

172
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,329
in this ring. And we're gonna see it right now.

173
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,329
Everyone's scared of him. Carl Griffinstein's gonna take

174
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,329
a punch. Jay Buffay's gonna take a punch.

175
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:16,329
Jerma's gonna get knocked down. Burger Boy's gonna get knocked down.

176
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,329
Glueman has cleared this

177
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,329
ring. Just simply untouchable.

178
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,329
Jerma gets another one. Jay Buffay another

179
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,329
one. And Jerma's back up immediately.

180
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:26,329
I think he bounced off the ropes. He's getting

181
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,329
really close. One punch. They're trading back

182
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,329
and forth. Glueman and Jerma. Glueman

183
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,329
and Jerma. Wait a minute.

184
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,329
Wait a minute. He's got Jerma by the

185
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,329
neck. Getting really close to those ropes.

186
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,329
Jerma's gonna.

187
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:40,329
Through the table. Over the

188
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,329
top ropes. Through the table. Jerma

189
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,329
has been eliminated. The first

190
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,329
elimination of Germarubble live.

191
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:48,329
Being taunted.

192
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:51,339
A very, very

193
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,339
strong appearance. Gabe the Glueman

194
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,339
Degrosie. And

195
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,579
not sure.

196
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,579
Not sure what we're watching right now but that was terrible wrestling.

197
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,579
Anyways Jay Buffay seems

198
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,579
to be sweating through his shirt. Look at him.

199
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:05,579
It's almost like he's wearing a different colored

200
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,579
suit. Wait a minute. Dangerous place to be.

201
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,579
He's gone. That's

202
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,579
a second elimination from Gabe the Glueman.

203
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,579
Capitalizing on an

204
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,579
extremely costly mistake.

205
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,420
And now we've only got four people

206
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,420
in the ring. We've got two or three

207
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,420
exhausted wrestlers while Glueman

208
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
has plenty of vitality just coming in.

209
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
Burger Boy going off the ropes.

210
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,420
Into a rock bottom. Beautiful rock

211
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,420
bottom. That looked like it actually

212
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,420
hurt. And that was

213
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,420
a terrible snap there. But here comes number

214
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
seven. The most iconic video

215
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
game character of all time. You've

216
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
heard me gush about him. You've heard me talk about him.

217
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
It's Pac-Man. The most

218
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,420
beloved person in all of

219
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
gaming history. And as I

220
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
watch his entrance I'm reminded of all the wonderful

221
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
times I had playing Pac-Mania.

222
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,420
I don't think he knows where

223
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,860
he's going. I think he's having

224
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
somebody had to come out here and try to tell him where to go. I don't think he knows where

225
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,420
to go. He needs to get

226
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
in the ring. He's not getting

227
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
in the ring. Pac-Man has decided

228
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
not to get in the ring. I have no idea

229
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
where he's going.

230
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,420
I think it looks like he's leaving the arena.

231
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,589
As we come back to the ring, big sweet

232
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:15,589
chin music by Glueman who is just

233
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,589
dominating the opponents right now.

234
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,589
Oh, he's doing his patented move. That's called

235
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,589
a sword slash. And

236
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,589
just want to bring up real quick. Jerma

237
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,149
is still on the ground out here.

238
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,149
He's just gonna leave me out there?

239
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,149
That's pretty messed up. Somebody should probably

240
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,149
come and get me. But Bergeboy now

241
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,149
on the back of Glueman doing a reverse

242
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,149
choke. Glueman has seemed to lost

243
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,149
a little bit of steam here. Bergeboy

244
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,149
taking the advantage doing some submission moves

245
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,149
and really working that leg

246
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,149
into the knee area on

247
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,149
Glueman who now seems to be in a little

248
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,149
bit of trouble. Can't seem to get his bearings

249
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,149
up while Carl Griffenstein now going for a right hand

250
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,149
onto Bergeboy gets thrown

251
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,149
back into the corner

252
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:56,149
where he has spent a lot of time

253
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,149
in this rumble while Glueman really connecting those

254
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,149
sword slashes. You can just feel the impact

255
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,149
when he connects with those sword slashes.

256
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:04,149
And Bergeboy now trying to go for a close line

257
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,149
no one gets rock bottomed again.

258
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,149
And here comes number eight.

259
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,149
The ultimate bag of shit.

260
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,149
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand

261
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,149
for some...

262
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:16,149
He just threw a bottle into the crowd. He was trying

263
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,149
to hit somebody with a fucking bottle.

264
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:20,149
By the way, that's not our belt.

265
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:22,149
I have no idea where he got that. It's not ours.

266
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:24,149
But anyways, here's Sonic the Hedgehog

267
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,149
coming into the ring for the fourth time

268
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,149
in German rumble history. Really going real fast.

269
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:30,149
You see how fast he's going. Just

270
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,149
blazing up those stairs at Sonic's speed

271
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,149
as the character's title suggests

272
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,149
that he's getting in the ring. Welcome Sonic

273
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:38,149
the Hedgehog as Glueman is

274
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,149
choking Bergeboy with his cape

275
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,149
in the corner while Carl Griffenstein...what is he doing?

276
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,149
Sonic the Hedgehog's charging up a move.

277
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,149
Oh, a devastating

278
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,149
Sonic dash. His signature

279
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:50,149
move. And it's a remarkable

280
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:52,149
feat that he didn't lose the cigarette

281
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,149
hanging out of his mouth. I can't believe

282
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,149
he did that. What a true

283
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,149
testament to his ability to do

284
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:00,149
things like that. And I don't even know what the fuck

285
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,149
I was just saying. But ladies and gentlemen, now Carl

286
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,149
Griffenstein is coming over and punching

287
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,149
Bergeboy with Sonic.

288
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,149
You'd think that they would want to team up on Sonic as he just

289
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,149
got in, but apparently not. They're both

290
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,149
working on Bergeboy as...and no, no,

291
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,149
Sonic the Hedgehog now throwing Carl Griffenstein

292
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,149
in the corner and is

293
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,149
going to do absolutely nothing to him.

294
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,389
Well, I think this is a good enough time to do one of our

295
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,389
two legally required advertisements.

296
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,389
So let's check out some fruit. Fruit.

297
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,389
Not just a healthy snack,

298
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:28,389
but also very cheap and affordable.

299
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:30,389
Go to your local grocery store and buy it by

300
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,389
weight. You can do it with apples, you can

301
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:34,389
do it with bananas, or you can even juice some oranges

302
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:36,389
with your son. Fruit.

303
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,389
Eat it up. As we get

304
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,389
back to the action here and Bergeboy is in trouble. Bergeboy gets

305
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,389
dumped over the top ropes. No! Just

306
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,389
barely does not get eliminated. He held

307
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,389
on for dear life. Thank God we got back

308
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,389
in time, as now he's trying to get himself

309
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,389
over the ropes where Glooman now gets a right punch

310
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,389
allowing Bergeboy an opportunity to

311
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,389
gracefully get over the top ropes again

312
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,389
and find his way back into the ring.

313
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,389
Almost eliminated as Glooman

314
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,389
big right hand into Bergeboy's face.

315
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,389
That really happened.

316
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,389
Let's get a replay. That's not a

317
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,389
joke. That actually happened. He really punched

318
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,389
him right in his nose. Take a look at the fruit.

319
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,389
Eat it up in the replay.

320
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:12,389
Punched him right in the face in real life.

321
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,389
I don't think I've mentioned this yet, but

322
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:16,389
don't fucking do this at home. Don't try this.

323
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,389
Fuck. This knocked over my fucking drink.

324
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,389
Anyways, we got Glooman

325
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,389
has got Bergeboy in a

326
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,389
pedigree, it seems. He's got him

327
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,389
lifting him up in the air. No, he can't seem

328
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:28,389
to lift him. He pushes him into the corner.

329
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,389
Bergeboy now is trying to get him under the top ropes.

330
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,389
We're gonna see a big move here.

331
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,389
Potentially a huge slam.

332
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Well, at number nine, we got a new contestant coming in.

333
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
This is a fan favorite.

334
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
This is none other than Dick Dastardly

335
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Richard from the rat movies.

336
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
He is a criminal. He is an

337
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
outlaw. And he's also a master

338
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
of taekwondo. As you see him

339
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
showing off his moves there for the

340
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
cameras getting into the ring for the second time

341
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
in German Rumble history. Getting up behind Sonic the Hedgehog

342
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
throwing him down to the ground.

343
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Sonic the Hedgehog wasn't really prepared for that

344
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
while we have him. What are

345
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,159
these two doing? This is just

346
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,159
awful. This is the worst wrestling

347
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,159
I've ever seen in my life. And you got Carl

348
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,159
unconscious in the corner

349
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,159
doing nothing, just sitting there, while

350
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,159
Dick Richards is kicking the shit out of Sonic the Hedgehog.

351
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,159
I don't know what to look at. I'm not sure what's

352
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,159
worse to talk about. We are getting

353
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,159
a maybe three percent

354
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,159
effort performance from these two.

355
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,159
I would appreciate like five percent

356
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,590
effort. And they're dancing now.

357
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
They're dancing. That's fantastic.

358
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,590
Well, we cut to Dick Richards adjusting his mask

359
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,590
and kicking Sonic, while Glooman now

360
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,590
getting punches in the back and he's going over the top

361
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,590
ropes. Are you serious?

362
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,590
Well, Sonic is on the other side as well

363
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,590
and Dick Richards is gonna be going for a

364
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,590
slide tackle, knocking Sonic

365
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,590
the Hedgehog out. He is eliminated.

366
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,590
That is it. See you later, Sonic the Hedgehog.

367
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,590
You are

368
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,590
gone. As we cut

369
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,590
back into the ring and we see Glooman now is in trouble.

370
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,590
Burger Boy does the same slide tackle

371
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,590
and eliminates Glooman.

372
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,590
Glooman is out. He is eliminated.

373
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,590
He was dicking around too much

374
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,590
and got too gassed and exhausted

375
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,590
and he is gone. It's too

376
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,590
bad. Maybe next year, Glooman,

377
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,590
when you don't look like such a fucking ripped up

378
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,590
sock as we get back to the ring.

379
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,899
Burger Boy riling the crowd up a little bit

380
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,899
here, trying to get some energy

381
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,899
into the arena.

382
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,669
Getting the

383
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,669
boo, Dick Dastardly Richard.

384
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,549
Wow, it seems to

385
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,549
go and he gets a knee in his stomach for his troubles.

386
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,549
Got under Dick Richards skin there.

387
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,549
You don't want to do that. He'll get you with that

388
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,549
clothesline, a devastating one. I'm sure

389
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,549
he can see real fine through that mask.

390
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,549
As we have the next contestant.

391
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:42,549
If I could please have your

392
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,549
attention. For the

393
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,549
first time ever.

394
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,549
Someone in the audience

395
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:50,549
will be the next contestant

396
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:52,549
in the Dremel Rumble. So

397
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,549
if you could please look under your

398
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:56,549
seat and if you have number A14

399
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,549
you are the next

400
00:13:58,549 --> 00:14:00,549
contestant in the Dremel

401
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,549
Rumble. What a true

402
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,549
honor that is. Wow.

403
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:06,549
What lucky audience member

404
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,789
is going to be the next

405
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:13,399
contestant in our sold out

406
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,600
crowd.

407
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
There he is ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,840
The audience member.

409
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Rounding us out at number 10.

410
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
We are at the halfway point of Dremel Rumble

411
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
live. As he gets into the ring

412
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
rips off his shirt. He's going up against

413
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
two top seeded competitors.

414
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
How can a regular fucking guy

415
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
deal with these two?

416
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
That's a question we need to get answered.

417
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,840
While the Burger Boy gets an opportunity here. Gets a left handed

418
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
swing slapper onto Dick Dastardly

419
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Richard. And no he gets reversed.

420
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Going into the ropes and Burger Boy is

421
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,909
That was the worst elimination

422
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:50,090
in the whole rumble. So he's out. Burger Boy

423
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,090
is eliminated. Which leaves us with

424
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,090
Carl Griffinstein, Dick Dastardly Richard and the

425
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,090
audience member who went for

426
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,090
a sneak attack but forgot to do the attack

427
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,090
part of the sneak. And now they're doing a test

428
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,090
of strength. This is the second test of strength

429
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,090
we've seen so far in this rumble.

430
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,090
Remember guys. The test of strength

431
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,090
is also defined as extreme

432
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,090
filler for untrained

433
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,090
unprofessional losers.

434
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,649
What's going on? More bullshit?

435
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,080
Really? There's no competitor

436
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
that's coming out right now. There's no new contestant.

437
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,450
Wait a minute.

438
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,450
Oh Jesus. No, no, no, no,

439
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,450
no, no. What's he doing here?

440
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,450
That's

441
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,450
Demon Lord Zaraxas.

442
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,450
He's not supposed to be here.

443
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,450
He's very upset.

444
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,450
I'm not sure what to say.

445
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,450
Oh shit, he's looking for me.

446
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh no, he's not.

447
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:54,309
Whoa! He just threw it!

448
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:56,309
He just threw a shitty CG

449
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:58,309
fireball at Jerma and he's burning.

450
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,309
Jerma is burning alive right now.

451
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,309
This is insanity.

452
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,309
What's he doing?

453
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:06,309
No, no, no, no.

454
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,309
He's...oh God!

455
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,309
He's casting a giant spell.

456
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:12,309
We're in deep shit.

457
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,309
Oh God. I can't even...

458
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,309
It's hard for me to even talk. Dick Richard

459
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,309
just went over the top rope.

460
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,309
No, no, no. This is it.

461
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,309
He's gonna kill us all. This is the end.

462
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,679
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

463
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,679
That's the apple.

464
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,679
That's the apple.

465
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,679
Ladies and gentlemen, the apple has come to

466
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,679
rescue the rumble. Thank

467
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:36,679
goodness for the apple.

468
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,679
And speaking of apples, cool and crisp

469
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,679
with a refreshing crunch. It's no

470
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,679
wonder it's the doctor's favorite. At just

471
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,679
95 calories, it's the guilt-free

472
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,679
party fruit. Invite some friends

473
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,679
over or just enjoy one in your

474
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,679
home. Apples, nature's

475
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,370
candy. And that's gonna

476
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,370
bring us to a...

477
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,370
Okay, alright.

478
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,370
Look, there's another competitor coming in right now.

479
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,370
You can stop booing.

480
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,370
Did someone ask for an egg?

481
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,059
Because it's the egg.

482
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,059
Fun trivia for you here. This is

483
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,059
only the second video the egg has ever

484
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:12,059
been in. You've got to go back five

485
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,059
years for the last one.

486
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,059
So thank you for the dedication here, egg,

487
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,059
making your appearance after five years

488
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,059
missing in action. As he gets

489
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,059
up to the ring, the crowd really loves him. People

490
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,059
in the ring not so much. He's sort of getting

491
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,059
laughed at by the audience member. I wouldn't

492
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:28,059
do that if I were you, as Carl Gryffenstein

493
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,059
is standing up and...

494
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,059
He's

495
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,059
leaving the ring. He just bumped into

496
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,059
the egg. The egg didn't even try to get out of the way.

497
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,059
The egg has been eliminated.

498
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,059
And Carl Gryffenstein has been eliminated.

499
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,299
What the fuck is going on?

500
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,710
I don't know.

501
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,710
But nonetheless, we have a

502
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,710
wrestling event to get back to. That's right, this is still

503
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,710
a wrestling event.

504
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,710
I would like to get back to doing that.

505
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,710
As the EMT, our medical

506
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,710
professional on staff, is going to try

507
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,710
to use his skills to

508
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,710
salvage what he can of the egg.

509
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,710
And hopefully we see a swift full recovery

510
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,710
of the egg. But

511
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,710
it looks pretty dire. It also looks pretty

512
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,710
dire for Jerma as well.

513
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,710
Looks like he may have at least one broken bone

514
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,710
here, as the EMT is

515
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,710
going to pick him up and get him on that gurney.

516
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,710
If we could get a small round of applause for these

517
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,710
two, they put their heart and soul into

518
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,710
this event. Both of them will be in our

519
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,710
prayers tonight for sure.

520
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,710
So we are at an impasse.

521
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,710
Because there's currently only one person in the

522
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,710
ring. Number 12 was supposed to be

523
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,710
the apple, but we know what happened there.

524
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,710
So number 12 is going to have to be this guy.

525
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,710
Or technically 13.

526
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,710
Backstage, somebody's going to have to push him in the right direction.

527
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,710
I know this is very short notice, but we do

528
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,710
appreciate it. You're probably not prepared for this.

529
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,710
You are. You are very prepared

530
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,710
for this. Wearing a bunsy under your EMT

531
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,710
uniform. That's a little strange.

532
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,710
I'm not going to lie. But that allows us

533
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,710
to put a real countdown on the screen.

534
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,710
He filled the spot. Thank you

535
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,710
for filling it. Well, we do a quick

536
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,710
sort of cut over here to see our new custodian

537
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,710
here. That's Custodio Daniel.

538
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,710
Doing a great job cleaning up the mess

539
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,710
of that catastrophe of situations that

540
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,710
just happened. While number 14 is

541
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,710
on its way, this is going to be a popular

542
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,400
one. From Overwatch,

543
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
please welcome

544
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Winston.

545
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
A real hero. An accomplished

546
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
scientist. And currently Jerma's

547
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
favorite character in the game.

548
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
As he gets in the ring here, not going to waste any time here.

549
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Big right hand onto the audience member.

550
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
And another right hand onto the EMT.

551
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Listen to this crowd as he goes back to the

552
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
audience member. Back and forth between the two

553
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
with more right hands. Absolutely

554
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
stunning work by Winston.

555
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
We are just graced by his presence

556
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
here. Currently trying to get a new

557
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Overwatch team together. I'm not sure

558
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
what he's doing here. He may, in fact,

559
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
be looking at this roster

560
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
of 20 to see if anybody in the JWF

561
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
can qualify to be on Overwatch.

562
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Ooh, as he takes a left-handed

563
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
swiveling elbow by the audience member.

564
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
And he dazed him a little bit. He gets a right hand

565
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
by the EMT into

566
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
another right hand.

567
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Wow, and what's he going to do here? Ooh, a right

568
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
hand. Hmm.

569
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
You know, I wonder if anybody in this ring can do

570
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
something else besides a right-handed punch.

571
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
As they are now

572
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
squaring up against each other. What's going to happen here?

573
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Right hand. Oh, I wonder.

574
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Right hand into another big

575
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
right hand. Wow.

576
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Really exciting stuff. Another exciting

577
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
right hand. Are we potentially going to see

578
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
an- Ooh, a right kick!

579
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
A right kick, ladies and gentlemen. Did you

580
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
see that? I can't believe it. He actually

581
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
kicked him with his right leg into-

582
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Wait a minute. I think he's got his ultimate!

583
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Jesus!

584
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Ooh! Ooh!

585
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,400
That did not sound good.

586
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
That's a noise that I don't want to hear

587
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
again. Oh, boy.

588
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Can we get a look at him? Make sure he's alright.

589
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,579
Is that- Oh, God!

590
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:45,579
Oh!

591
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,579
Okay. Well, we have a new contestant

592
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,579
coming, and hopefully the EMT is going to be alright.

593
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,579
But we do have a show to do, so we're going to have

594
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,579
to move on. Hailing from

595
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,579
Deadwood, South Dakota.

596
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,579
A real rootin' tootin' cowboy.

597
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,579
The two-person horse joke.

598
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:01,579
Currently seated at 19

599
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:03,579
of 20. For

600
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:05,579
pretty obvious reasons. As they get into

601
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,579
the ring here. If they even can

602
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,579
get into the ring. I'm not sure.

603
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,750
No?

604
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
They got it. They're doing it. They're doing it.

605
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,750
They got it. The two-person horse

606
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,750
joke is now in the ring. A very,

607
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,750
very strange competitor indeed.

608
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,750
And it looks like- A big front

609
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,750
kick there! And a big back kick!

610
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,750
Big back kick as well, by the

611
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,750
two-person horse. They seem to have

612
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,750
this flawless strategy of defense

613
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
and offense at the same time.

614
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,750
What are you supposed to do against this?

615
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,750
They're just going to trample around the ring like this. There's no

616
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
approach. And I'm actually getting word

617
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,750
we're going to be going backstage to see the EMT

618
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,750
is doing some type of self

619
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,750
procedure to himself. I'm not sure

620
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,750
if that's some type of saline solution, or if

621
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,750
that's something else entirely, but hopefully he's going to be alright.

622
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,750
He's okay.

623
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,930
Okay, good. We got the confirmation

624
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,930
from the EMT. He's going to be just fine.

625
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,930
So no worrying about that.

626
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,930
While the two-person horse is just trampling

627
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,930
the audience member and making his way over to Winston.

628
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,930
Trampling Winston as well. Double trample!

629
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,930
Both the front and the back are involved

630
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,930
with that. Digging those hooves down

631
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,930
deep into the chest of both these

632
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,930
two in the ground.

633
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,930
As we introduce number sixteen.

634
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,930
It just wouldn't

635
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,930
be a rumble without at least one, right?

636
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,930
We have to have at least one.

637
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,930
Yeah. Yeah.

638
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,930
That's 788 to be exact.

639
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,930
Flexing for the cameras. Showing off his strength.

640
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,930
That he's ready to get in the rumble.

641
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,930
And ready to win the rumble.

642
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,930
Which is definitely not going to happen. I can guarantee a

643
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,930
Bjerg will never win a gerber rumble.

644
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,930
A Bjerg can barely get up in the morning and brush his teeth.

645
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,930
Let alone win a fight.

646
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,930
Wait a minute. He's having some trouble

647
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,930
here.

648
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,930
He's yelling to somebody backstage. He's not even in the ring yet.

649
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,359
That's another Bjerg.

650
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:47,940
Guys, you can't

651
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
tag in mid rumble.

652
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
I don't think they understand that.

653
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
As the two person horse is now doing

654
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
his finishing move. The rootin tootin

655
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
tornado. Getting Winston

656
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,940
multiple times with the same move.

657
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Absolutely devastating.

658
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,180
All these guys did is just change clothes.

659
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Like I wasn't going to notice.

660
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
But you know what? I don't even give a shit at this point.

661
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,180
Get the ass 788 in here. Get him in the ring.

662
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
And he instantly gets kicked by the two person horse.

663
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Who is just circling the

664
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,180
ring. Kicking everybody.

665
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,180
And look at him now. Just taunting and reveling in the fact

666
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
that nobody can touch him. He's so confident.

667
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
He knows him. Wait a minute.

668
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Looks like the three of them are going to get together and

669
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
potentially work something out here.

670
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,180
The two person horse is not even paying attention.

671
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
And here we go. They're going to get behind him.

672
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
And really slowly and badly actingly

673
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,180
push him over to those ropes.

674
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Really shoving him through there. They're wedging

675
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
his head in between those ropes. But will it be

676
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
enough force to push him all the way

677
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
through? And it looks like they got him.

678
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,180
Wait.

679
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,180
Hold on a second. They think they eliminated

680
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,180
him. No. The bottom half is still

681
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,180
in the ring. They need to turn around.

682
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,809
Triple clothesline.

683
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,809
And listen to that.

684
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,809
A completely revitalized

685
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,809
two person horse. Let's take a look at that again.

686
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,809
He slips out of the back while

687
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,809
they're eliminating the front half. They didn't

688
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,809
even know. And they got a triple clothesline

689
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,809
for their efforts. That's what

690
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,809
you get for not paying attention.

691
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,809
So very interesting development

692
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:12,809
here. As it looks like the bia

693
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,809
is going to be going for

694
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,809
a big suplex onto Winston.

695
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,809
Ladies and gentlemen, that

696
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,809
is the first wrestling move in

697
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,809
almost nine minutes.

698
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,809
While the bottom half of the two person horse

699
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,809
is currently choking in a sleeper

700
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,809
hold, the audience member

701
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,809
who just barely broke out of that

702
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,809
as number 17 is going to make their entrance

703
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,809
I was promised a show with this

704
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,809
one. Please welcome

705
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,809
all the way from the whimsical world

706
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:40,809
of Wimbledon, the magician.

707
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,809
Me and him actually talked

708
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,809
backstage before the event.

709
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,809
Ooh, that was flashy.

710
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:48,809
He promised me we were going to see a lot

711
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,809
of great magic tricks. And he was going to quote

712
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,809
dazzle the entire audience.

713
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:54,809
So I have no idea what that

714
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,809
means. But hopefully we get to see some great

715
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,809
family friendly magic tricks from the magician.

716
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:00,809
Welcome. As he

717
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,809
is kind of just sitting on the turnbuckle.

718
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,809
No one's really paying attention to him.

719
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,180
What are those? Are those gloves?

720
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,859
Why is he putting on gloves?

721
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,039
I have no idea why did the hat

722
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,039
comes off though. And that was kind

723
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,039
of cool looking. I'm not going to lie.

724
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,410
Wow.

725
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,839
That was awesome.

726
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,660
What is that?

727
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,829
What is that?

728
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,829
What did he just do?

729
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:30,069
What did he just do?

730
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,069
He pulled his brain off. That's what he did.

731
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:34,069
Oh Jesus. Okay.

732
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:36,069
Whose heart is that?

733
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,069
I didn't know he was going to do this.

734
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,819
I thought he told me he was going to do magic tricks.

735
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,819
Organs out of a hat. Oh boy.

736
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,819
What's he doing? I don't know. And why are these

737
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,819
two just missing clotheslines?

738
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,819
Was that Pacman?

739
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,819
Whose is that?

740
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,819
I have no idea. But Pacman is

741
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,819
now getting into the ring. And a very large

742
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,819
portion of our audience is rioting.

743
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,819
He thinks this is hilarious.

744
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:00,819
Well Pacman is just looking around the ring.

745
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,819
I'm not sure what he's doing. But now he's got his

746
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:04,819
eyes set on the magician. He's on the ropes.

747
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:09,619
Easily the magician

748
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:11,619
is out. And

749
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,619
Pacman I believe just

750
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,619
wanted his seat. That was the only

751
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,619
motivation behind it. As we get back into

752
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,619
the ring and Pacman now is going to get picked up

753
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,619
on a powerbomb. No. Hurricane Rana.

754
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,619
What a beautifully

755
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,619
crafted Hurricane Rana that was. I forget

756
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,619
sometimes Pacman just accidentally

757
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,619
does things right.

758
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,619
As you see he's missing punches at

759
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:33,619
no one now. And now he

760
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:35,930
lost his shoe. As

761
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,930
Winston is going to grab the bottom half of the two person horse

762
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,930
and drag him into the middle of the ring.

763
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,930
Potentially go for a submission away

764
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,930
from Pacman. Getting underneath

765
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,930
no it's going to be a DDT.

766
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,930
Also

767
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,930
by the way I'm getting word right now that

768
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,930
we have some unfortunate news to report.

769
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,930
Backstage the EMT has died.

770
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,549
So the bottom half of the two person

771
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,549
horse gets thrown into the corner and Pacman

772
00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:00,549
is kind of doing his own thing. As

773
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,549
number eighteen is on the

774
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:04,549
way. And I've just got

775
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,549
to say it's time to get in the

776
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,549
spirit. It's time to get into

777
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:11,369
the mood. Merry

778
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,369
Christmas and welcome

779
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,369
the Christmas tree.

780
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,930
I kind of want this video to be watchable

781
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,930
year round. So

782
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,930
you know you can come back and watch this on

783
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,930
Christmas. You know what I mean?

784
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,930
But anyways the Christmas tree

785
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,930
making his rumble debut. Dolan

786
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,230
literally falls into the ring.

787
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,230
May have just been able to see his dick.

788
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,230
I truly hope not. I'm

789
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,230
not sure why he's not wearing pants. But

790
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,230
he's in the ring nonetheless the Christmas tree.

791
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,230
As he's going to grab Pacman here.

792
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,230
He's got Pacman in the air. He's going to do deck the halls.

793
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,230
That's deck the halls. The devastating

794
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,230
move. He does it to Pacman. The first

795
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,230
move he does is his finisher. That is

796
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,230
impressive from the Christmas tree.

797
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,230
As he takes off one of his presents. Throws the present at Pacman.

798
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,230
Pacman's a little bit shooken up still from

799
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,230
that devastating deck the halls. And a right handed

800
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,230
punch right in his mouth. While

801
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,230
Winston is being pummeled away in the corner

802
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,230
by the bottom half of the two person horse. And now

803
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,230
Pacman they're doing a punch train. This is

804
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,230
ridiculous. Pacman just got behind him.

805
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,230
And wait a second. Oh speaking

806
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,230
of finishing moves. Here comes Pacman's signature

807
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,230
move. The push. There he goes.

808
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,230
He's got two. He's going for three.

809
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,230
No he gets caught. He's going to get thrown over the ropes.

810
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,230
Oh he just barely hangs on.

811
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,230
Pacman is still in this

812
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,230
rumble. And can you hear that crowd? They

813
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,230
want him to win. And you know what?

814
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,230
So do I.

815
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,119
Shit.

816
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,119
So coming in number

817
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,119
19 after that tragic

818
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,119
self elimination

819
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,619
is going to be

820
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,619
Well we were just in a pizza box.

821
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,619
So I have no idea.

822
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,859
I think we're outside.

823
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,859
This looks like a junkyard.

824
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,859
So I mean we're going to cut back to the ring.

825
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,859
The two person horse now is getting its tail pulled.

826
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,859
Seems to be a working strategy.

827
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,859
Now the Christmas tree is going to help Winston.

828
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,859
I think they finally found a weakness.

829
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:58,859
As he rolls

830
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,859
onto the ground. Pulling that

831
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,859
tail must have been extremely painful

832
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:04,859
while Winston and the Christmas tree.

833
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,859
Oh big left hand there by the Christmas tree.

834
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,859
Not sure who's going to make a move here. They're both kind

835
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,859
of reluctant. Oh a little right handed jab.

836
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,859
Must have. Oh!

837
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,859
A low blow.

838
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:16,859
Wow. That was resorting to some

839
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,859
terrible terrible things. As we are back

840
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:20,859
on this camera now. Whatever this happens to be

841
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,859
is in the arena now.

842
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,859
Climbing up on the steps.

843
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,859
Currently in the ring. This

844
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,859
is number 19 by the way.

845
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:30,859
Still unsure of what it is.

846
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,859
I can't really see from over here. But I

847
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:34,859
do know that whatever it is, is causing

848
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,859
some type of problem in the ring. Everyone's

849
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,859
kind of walking around scared of it.

850
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,859
Nobody in the ring seems to know what to do

851
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,859
with whatever this thing is. The Christmas tree

852
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,859
now kind of peering at it. Looks like

853
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:46,859
he's going to potentially stomp on it. Oh!

854
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,670
It caught his foot!

855
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,670
It's a giant rat! That's a giant rat!

856
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,170
I'm not sure how I didn't see that before.

857
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,170
I must be having vision problems. Because

858
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,170
I'm pretty close. But the Christmas tree now

859
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,170
everyone's running away from it. That's not a good

860
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,170
place to be on the other side of the ropes. Wait

861
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,170
the giant rat is biting his leg. Just gnawing

862
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,170
at him. And the Christmas tree

863
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,660
is re- Shit! I just bit my tongue!

864
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
You just made me bite my tongue!

865
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
Ow! Here's the giant

866
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,660
rat. Christmas tree has been eliminated

867
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,660
cut down by the giant

868
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
rat who seems to be wanting to

869
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,660
make friends with the bottom half of the two-person

870
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,660
horse. What the hell was that?

871
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,900
Why would you try to shake his hand?

872
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Oh! They're both animals.

873
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Okay, I get it. And Winston

874
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
is also an animal. Did you

875
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,900
guys think that there'd be three animals in the

876
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,900
ring in the final four?

877
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,269
Yeah, I probably actually could have guessed that.

878
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,269
As the giant rat doing multiple punches

879
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,269
into Winston who has been in

880
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:43,269
the ring the longest.

881
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:45,269
A very long time as the giant rat

882
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:47,269
is going to go for a hug. Trying to hug his

883
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:49,269
friend. Is he going to get it while the last competitor

884
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:51,269
is coming down into the ring?

885
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:53,269
I don't think he got it. No! He's getting punched.

886
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,269
But who is number 20?

887
00:30:55,269 --> 00:31:10,950
He always comes back

888
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,950
and he always gets what he fucking wants.

889
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,950
And that's the titan

890
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:22,180
demon grandpa, ladies and gentlemen.

891
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
If you don't understand

892
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
I will try to explain as best as I can.

893
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,180
But, wait a minute, grandpa

894
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Grandpa's grabbing the giant rat

895
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,180
by the face.

896
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
He's holding him in the air.

897
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
He's yelling something. I can't tell.

898
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,180
We're at the rat cam right now.

899
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
We can't really determine what he's saying.

900
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,180
He just dropped him in the trash!

901
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
That's it!

902
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
He's been eliminated.

903
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,180
My god.

904
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,809
Let's try to describe what's happening here.

905
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,809
Ladies and gentlemen, grandpa

906
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,809
was chokeslammed into hell

907
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,809
in Jerma Rumble 3.

908
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:59,809
Grandpa is not a character.

909
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,809
He doesn't get extra lives.

910
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:03,809
He doesn't get to come back to life.

911
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:05,809
He goes right to fucking hell where he belongs.

912
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,289
A few different skills.

913
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,289
I guarantee you he came in the same portal

914
00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:14,289
that Xeraxos came in. And he probably

915
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,289
taught him a few things. Let's see what's

916
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:18,980
going to happen here.

917
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Just lightning-like reflexes.

918
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
Goodness. He just hit him with

919
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
the three stooges. I think that's

920
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
his finishing move. I have no idea

921
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
what to say here, guys. All I

922
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
know is that he is probably

923
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,049
going to win. And now he's just

924
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:36,049
taunting Winston, who's been in here for so

925
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:38,049
long he's probably exhausted.

926
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:40,049
What a grab. He definitely has

927
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:42,049
eyes in the back of his head and twists and turns

928
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:44,049
and throws the bottom half of the two-person horse

929
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,049
down on the ground.

930
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,049
I wish there was something I could do.

931
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,049
There are no rules in the Jerma Arena.

932
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,049
Shit like this is completely legal and totally fine

933
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,049
and accepted.

934
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,349
What's going on?

935
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,490
He's having a heart attack?

936
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,490
No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Don't fall for this.

937
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,490
He's done this shit before.

938
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,490
No! Winston's been eliminated.

939
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,789
And just like that

940
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,789
we are down to two.

941
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,789
The bottom half of the two-person horse

942
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,789
and Demon Grandpa. And the bottom half

943
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:15,789
of the two-person horse not only has been

944
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:17,789
in the ring for a long time, he was up

945
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,789
on the horse's ass for like 25 minutes before

946
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,789
even getting in the ring. So this is just

947
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:23,789
terrible. He needs to find some type of strength

948
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,789
to take on Grandpa.

949
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:27,789
He needs to do something. Anything!

950
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,220
What can he...

951
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,220
No, not this again. Don't fall for this shit

952
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,220
again.

953
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,220
Oh, heart attack. Okay, yeah. Go after

954
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,779
him now. Fight him! Any second now

955
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:41,539
he's gonna...he's gonna jump

956
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:43,539
up and he's gonna slash you with like a demon blade.

957
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:46,480
Any second he's gonna

958
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
he's gonna bite you and he's gonna stop biting you.

959
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,099
He's out!

960
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,849
That's it!

961
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,849
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner

962
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,849
of the first ever live action Jerma

963
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:02,849
Rumble is the bottom half

964
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,849
of the two-person horse.

965
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:07,019
What happened to

966
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,019
what the fuck was that?

967
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,019
That was a real heart attack?

968
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:13,019
I don't believe it. And the top

969
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,019
half is out here to congratulate his friend

970
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,019
for winning. They both are

971
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:19,019
winners.

972
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:24,980
Wait, what the? What's he talking about?

973
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
They're having some type of argument here about who actually

974
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,980
wins. They were one character. You have to remember.

975
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,389
I don't agree with that. I think you need

976
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,389
to be a collective unit.

977
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,389
He just tripped over and fell over

978
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,389
the ropes trying to attack his

979
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,590
friend. Oh my

980
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,590
fucking god.

981
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,590
Ladies and gentlemen,

982
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,829
the real winner

983
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,829
of the first ever Jerma Rumble

984
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,260
live action

985
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,820
is the Disco Diaper.

986
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,820
And here come the fruits to congratulate

987
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,820
him. He never was eliminated.

988
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,820
Everyone just forgot about him. I even

989
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820
forgot about him. He died like

990
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,820
fucking two hours ago.

991
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,000
Whatever the fuck it was.

992
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And they're celebrating.

993
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,010
I am speechless right now.

994
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,010
But congratulations

995
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,010
to the Disco Diaper.

996
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,179
And thank you all so much for joining

997
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:31,179
us for the first ever Jerma

998
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,179
Rumble live action.

999
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,179
It was a fucking train wreck.

1000
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:37,179
And like seven people died.

1001
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,179
But thank you nonetheless for watching.

1002
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,179
We'll see you next time on

1003
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:43,179
the next Rumble. I've been Jerma.

1004
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,179
Thank you to everybody that

1005
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,179
participated in this event. Have a

1006
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:49,179
great rest of your day. A great rest of your evening.

1007
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,179
The fruits are out. Everybody's

1008
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:53,179
out. Have a good night.
