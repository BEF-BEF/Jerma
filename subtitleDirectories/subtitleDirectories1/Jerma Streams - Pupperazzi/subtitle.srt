1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:16,120
How's everybody doing? Yes, I'm very early. There's a reason for that though. You shouldn't go live if you are sick. I'm all right

2
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,519
Just feel kind of terrible

3
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,809
Why are you live? Get out of here. Yeah, right leave

4
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,739
What if I just left? I was like, all right fine. I'll go to bed

5
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:33,960
You sound awful

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,359
I just wanted to hang out for a few hours. Yeah, I you haven't seen me in like five days

7
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,920
Well, I mean well, hold on. When was Halloween?

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,840
And those of you that didn't watch the Halloween stream on Charlie's stream haven't seen me in even longer

9
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,340
Uh, the reason why I'm early

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,740
For those of you that don't know

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,259
yesterday

12
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:03,500
Um, I was in the pre-stream chat

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,120
I typically am

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,840
And I talked about how I didn't feel very well. I was like oh shit

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,439
Had all this fun stuff to do

16
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,530
And it turned out I didn't feel very good

17
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,709
So, uh, I was like I got up today. I took a covid test by the way. It's not covid

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,189
Or if it is it's not detectable in a test yet

19
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,549
But I've been testing every I want to say 12 hours

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
It's not that apparently

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,019
But it's something

22
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,379
And it's annoying

23
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:40,870
You have a weak immune system

24
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,870
I actually have a pretty strong immune system

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,659
Go to bed

26
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,500
Well, okay, so I got up and I was contemplating if I was gonna stream today

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,409
But I mean I pushed the stream yesterday to today

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,209
And I didn't want to do it again because I want to stream i'm here. I want to stream

29
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:12,389
So we were gonna play neon white and frog detective, but I definitely can't do the frog detective voices

30
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,060
So we're gonna play a cute dog game where you take pictures of dogs

31
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:21,530
This I've actually had this in my steam list for

32
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,860
months

33
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,860
It's called paparazzi

34
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,789
nice cheese voice

35
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,270
Wait, do you mean that's the milk voice? I know what you mean

36
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,849
This is what you sound like when you eat like a block of cheddar

37
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:53,139
That's so gross

38
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,169
Uh, yeah, i'll take the whole milk, please

39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,219
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love whole milk. It's so good

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,719
Who's you don't who does anybody drink whole milk in here?

41
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,060
Be honest with me. Do you drink whole milk?

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,819
To me whole milk is something you put you mix with eggs

43
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:28,710
And you make food with it or like desserts doesn't nobody drinks whole milk, right?

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,110
Only two week olds drink whole milk. Um

45
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,229
It's better for you. It's better for you

46
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,060
I actually don't really like a dairy milk at all anymore

47
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,870
It's crazy because after a while of drinking

48
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,069
I'm an oat milk chad, by the way, but wait, are there any other oat milk chads in here?

49
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,330
I would hope so

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,259
Yeah, so oat milk

51
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:09,180
When you drink or you I put it in my coffee usually or whatever. I put it in cereal

52
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,139
Going back to real dairy milk

53
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,219
tastes

54
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,220
Like it, I don't know tastes like blood

55
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,180
It's weird. It tastes like meat

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,379
Does anyone know what i'm talking about?

57
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,339
Those of you that uh did a milk substitute for a long time went back to real milk. It tastes like you're drinking meat

58
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:38,629
It's very weird

59
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,329
milk substitutes

60
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,649
I honestly I I used to like almond milk

61
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,610
but then I kind of

62
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,470
Read some articles of how like almonds are destroying california

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,279
and was like, uh

64
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:54,899
I think I thought that maybe i'll switch to something else

65
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:03,610
So I was like, oh, maybe i'll do oat milk

66
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,329
And then I tried soy milk and that's soy milk sucks

67
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,329
Can I let's be very honest here soy milk is like

68
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,870
I hate it

69
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,230
It's like rice milk, which is okay. That's fine. It's a little thin for me

70
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,939
And then I found oat milk

71
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,300
And it's it's got full of flavor. It's a little sweet

72
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,259
It's it's delicious

73
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,209
It's great stuff

74
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,529
If you wanted me to do a milk tier list, I would and oat milk would be number one s plus

75
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,300
Are you for real? No, you actually you said are you real?

76
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:54,149
But yes

77
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,750
Are you for real?

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,579
What do you say most people what?

79
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,620
Oat milk is the reason why you're fucked up. That's not accurate. I started drinking oat milk like two years ago

80
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,019
But fucked up for a long time

81
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:11,160
How come there's no milk mode enabled in obs? I don't know

82
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Almond milk is really good

83
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,410
No, I I like almond milk

84
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,420
Just almonds take so much to grow and they take so much to harvest and stuff

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
I don't know. I've read some articles

86
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
But anyways, i'm not feeling great

87
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
But I didn't want to not scream because I wanted to hang out

88
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,379
It's been a while

89
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,939
Um, so we're gonna play paparazzi. Let's do it. Why not?

90
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060

Fig paste and i'm gonna enjoy my cheese plate and i'm really sorry if you can't fucking take it

00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,220
Yeah, i've put the cheese plate away. Put the cheese plate away. No, i'm gonna finish it

98
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,860
All right, so did I try to do face cam today? Whatever. I will fine

I'm actually kind of excited for this. It's gonna be a chill day

102
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,639

About time we see dogs had someone to photograph our adorable wee faces

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,540
Will you take a photo of me?

107
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,269
I feel like I shouldn't be playing this game

108
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,990
I don't know. It just hit me like i just like a brick

109
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,660
I don't know. It's freaking me out for some reason. Why I don't know why this is freaking me out

110
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,899
This game's like cute. What's it? I have to like settle down. All right, hold on use the mouse to look around

Aim your camera with the right mouse button. Okay, take a photo with the left mouse button

00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,490
There it is. Open your journal to view objectives

337
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:15,380

00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,909
Actually not great

365
00:34:47,909 --> 00:35:01,670
It was it was okay, but this is the subject here. I'm gonna show you something else, too

Can somebody tell me why i'm filming it like this?

376
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,550
Somebody tell me why i'm doing it like that because the bench is the subject

377
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,710
The bench the corners are lining up with the thirds

378
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,210
Like this. Oh

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,909

I gotta talk I gotta tell you this story because it's fucking crazy

429
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,170
So at the airport

430
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,769
I came when I was if you didn't know I was I was I was on charlie's stream

431
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,170
Uh, I was out on the east coast

432
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,210
Hanging out with charlie. It was fun. It was awesome

433
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,570
Those guys are all incredible definitely gonna be doing some more shit with with that group because they're so fun

434
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,389
They're so funny and they're they're awesome to be around but so

435
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,039
I on the I got home, right? So

436
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,900
As I get home and i'm you know, i'm at the airport and I have to get into an elevator

437
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,139
I oh, yeah, i've got my land i'm in vegas. I gotta get in the elevator, right?

438
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:10,340
so

439
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,780
This elevator

440
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:18,260
Is a lot of people use this elevator in the vegas airport and it goes up and down it only goes one floor

441
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,929
and

442
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:22,170
I'm I have my bag

443
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,289
And i'm dragging my well, no, but not that's wrong with I had a backpack

444
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,809
So I had a backpack on didn't have very much luggage. So I was just walking around. No, this is not a bit

445
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,369
So I have to get in this elevator and I see there are people already in the elevator

446
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:35,849
And it's like okay. I'm i'm walking

447
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:39,610
I'm far enough away where I could probably make it the doors are open

448
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:42,250
There's only a few people in there and they start to close

449
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,139
And you know when somebody's coming, right?

450
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,039
Usually you like oh you put your arm out or something. Oh that person's there, but they couldn't see me

451
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,289
These people could not see me

452
00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:54,570
so

453
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,010
Usually you've got to hold it for the person that you see coming because they're going to get into

454
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:01,750
So i'm walking nobody's doing that because nobody can see me

455
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,949
And I just i'm like, I think I can make this the doors are closing

456
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,590
And as I walk

457
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:12,630
I perfectly I have no fucking idea how this happened. I have never done this before

458
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:18,150
As i'm walking I get to I get in right when the doors are in the exact

459
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,969
Micro meter

460
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:26,409
Of space for me to get in and get crushed by the doors. I got fucking smushed

461
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,650
I've I just walked in and I was like I can I can make it I can make it

462
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:36,869
Yeah, and I went out and the both the doors went like like on my shoulders and it was like

463
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:41,750
and then

464
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:47,269
Honestly, I would have laughed right? Nobody's laughing. So they're just kind of looking at me like

465
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,750
Oh shit, I was like, oh

466
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,429
I said something I was I don't know. What the fuck did I say? I said like

467
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:57,750
Gotta be careful these don't I don't I said something like fucking stupid because it was embarrassing

468
00:42:58,389 --> 00:42:59,510
and then

469
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:06,730
So the doors start to close and that's done with and then I hear oh you have room for one more and i'm like

470
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:13,300
Yeah, and the dude the door is closing again. And again, I I get my hand in there

471
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:17,780
Right when it is in the worst possible time the doors are closed

472
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,059
And it was like like closing on my hand

473
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,719
And it was like oh shit

474
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,719
The doors will open again

475
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,679
And like I should just let it close but like I don't know. I like I wanted to let this guy in

476
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
And this guy had a bunch of stuff

477
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,000
and I think the people that were in the elevator with me were just like

478
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,400
Like this motherfucker. I swear to god dude, just like there's the it goes one floor. It'll be back

479
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:49,380
so the guy rolls in all of his stuff and

480
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:54,179
I think I don't know. I was trying to be like, oh i'm like a weirdo. We're like, oh hey like

481
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,860
And I think I said like be careful those doors again, and then I kind of was like

482
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,360
I was like, huh?

483
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,019
And I'll tell you right now. I was the first person out of that fucking elevator

484
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,309
I was the first person out the elevator opened and I was just gone like just like have a good night

485
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:16,139
Yeah, the guy had like they got like at least four or five bags that he kept bringing in

486
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,730
But I just imagine man you sit there in an elevator

487
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:30,760
And you're just you've been traveling and just somebody just as the elevator is closing walks in and gets perfectly

488
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,400
To the to like the millimeter directly walking into the doorway right when it crushes both of his shoulders

489
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,800
And he goes like oh

490
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,360
That would live in my head forever. I would think I would laugh at that every day

491
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:50,780
I would laugh at that every single day. I think I would in the shower. It would just pop in

492
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:03,699
But anyways any more tweets?

493
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:09,699
I actually wrote it. I said walking into an this is a tweet walking into elevator. I got crushed like a cartoon sideways

494
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,420
Period audible. Ow

495
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,659
Okay

496
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:25,380
I don't know why I wrote this watching tv in my hotel room

497
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:30,579
I just saw two different lactative commercials for two completely different products in a row

498
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,579
Followed by a fried chicken commercial. What the fuck?

499
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
That's true. That was fucking weird

500
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,360
It was I was like what the fuck is going on?

501
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,679
Yeah

502
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,329
Release your tweets. No, these tweets are for me

503
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,769
This is a fucking really good one here

504
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,500
And I mean it is like one of the best and i'm going to post it

505
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,460
I am i'm not going to read that one. That one's too good to read

506
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:17,940
That one's going up eventually. It's too. It's like the best tweet i've ever written and you're not going to hear it until it's there

507
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,500
I use it like a diary. Yeah

508
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:32,219
No, i'm not going to tell you i'm not posting it now either. It's very specific. No, i'm not releasing them

509
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,300
All right. What was I doing?

510
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,380
I just gave myself like a bad headache. Fuck

511
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,230
I was supposed to chill today, but it was so I had to hear about it. It was so funny

512
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:50,570
I can't I can't post it. All right, I gotta let's slow down

513
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:59,190
I have to help clean up the skate park. See what you knew about the trash

514
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,269
There should be dumpsters around then send me a photo

515
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:10,969
I want to take a picture of this

516
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:15,210
Take it easy, man

517
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:21,320
Oh, I like that one

518
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Oh my god

519
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,670
Oh, that's sad. All right

520
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,150
Hey germo

521
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,670
Oh, it's dev dev dev and chat. We put a lot of love into this game

522
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,989
Where i'm a huge germania fan and i'm thrilled to see you playing

523
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,949
Oh shit, really? That's cool

524
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,250
Try to get some food

525
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,250
Try and get some food from the vendors

526
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,699
Oh shit, really?

527
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:09,130
Hold on that would have been perfect. But the uh on the right

528
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,400
So can I buy stuff?

529
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:27,369
How do I buy the uh the frobert? How come you look like this? I don't know because i'm sick

530
00:48:29,269 --> 00:48:31,269
Oh, wait, can I buy uh, can I buy from you?

531
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:34,730
Oh my god, I'm gonna like puke

532
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,960
What's going on here?

533
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,960
Actually, not a bad photo considering

534
00:48:43,239 --> 00:49:00,039
Look at you're on a bike

535
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:07,559
Not bad

536
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,369
Okay. What was I doing?

537
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,539
Oh, I want to get the fisheye lens

538
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,420
Yep

539
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,719
Let's go

540
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,099
Stylish pack

541
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:23,989
All right fisheye lens

542
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:25,190
velvet

543
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,289
mocha

544
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:36,250
Let's do regular

545
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:45,960
Is this fisheye on? Well, this is not extreme fisheye

546
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:57,289
Okay, I need to clean up the skate park. I need third. I only need one more follower and i'm a fucking millionaire

547
00:49:57,289 --> 00:50:00,059
Whatever it is

548
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:05,289
Look on the truck

549
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:09,289
Oh my god. All right

550
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,170
What?

551
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:17,239
You want this?

552
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,239
Oh, it has a face

553
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,579
Look over here

554
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:27,059
Look this way

555
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:29,059
How to survive a falling elevator

556
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,190
Here's the only way to survive a falling elevator

557
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:38,949
Most people think you should jump right before you hit the ground

558
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,389
However, it'll be difficult to jump while you're falling

559
00:50:42,389 --> 00:50:44,389
That's me

560
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:57,380
Secondly, if you're falling at a speed 45 you should just lie. Just remember

561
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,619
You know what's so funny about the green screen stuff and i'm actually very happy about this

562
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,400
Like when you're looking for just like just royalty free shit

563
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:10,170
It actually can be kind of hard

564
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,769
It can be kind of annoying

565
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:17,900
so i'm actually kind of happy that like people can use it whether it's like a corporate video or any like

566
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:20,619
Project whatever like those those green screen

567
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,019
pieces of footage

568
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:28,659
That you could just use them, right? I i'm not gonna sue you. I'm just telling you right?

569
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,980
Uh, that's actually I like seeing that that's funny. That's really funny though

570
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,340
Show it

571
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:45,300
Okay. Well, hold on

572
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,889
It's like me jumping

573
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:50,889
Uh, hold on. Let me put this in here

574
00:51:50,889 --> 00:52:04,280
He's against question three. So is she?

575
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:07,800
and labor unions too

576
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:19,239
Crime is skyrocketing

577
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:20,760
Okay, let me put this on

578
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:42,300
Here's the only way to survive a falling elevator

579
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:46,059
Most people think you should jump right that's what I thought you hit the ground

580
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:53,739
However, it'll be difficult to jump while you're falling and secondly if you're falling at a speed of 50 miles per hour

581
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:56,699
And you jump five miles per hour into the air

582
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,980
You're still gonna hit the ground at 45 miles per hour

583
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,420
Now instead of jumping you should just lie flat on your back

584
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:07,019
This way the impact is spread equally throughout your whole body

585
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:13,340
But just remember with today's modern safety features your chances of dying are about one in 10 million

586
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:20,300
I love that jump too. It's like that's that's a very extreme jump

587
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,769
People wouldn't jump like this

588
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:30,110
Jump while however, it'll be difficult. However, it'll be difficult

589
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,699
Uh, I love it. No, but that's what I mean though. I it's that's I like that

590
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,219
Getting like royalty free shit

591
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:47,019
Is like it's just so it's a it's a pain in the ass

592
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,739
There's apparently more in that video

593
00:53:56,469 --> 00:54:02,980
Okay, that's cool

594
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:14,309
Hey educational too. Is it just yeah, would you can I just spam this?

595
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,860
Oh

596
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,300
Yeah smart

597
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,539
All right. I'm gonna bring uh, this one. This is probably pineapple. Oh my god

598
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,360
I want to dole whip so bad

599
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,980
Oh my god

600
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,260
When we were at disney

601
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,260
Probably eight fucking seven of these

602
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,840
I want it so bad. All right. Wait, I want the yogurt

603
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,440
Wait tennis ball

604
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,360
Go get it. Oh you you're into it. All right

605
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,679
Go catch

606
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:06,760
Nice catch

607
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,360
You don't know what dole whip is it's pineapple ice cream. It's pineapple soft serve

608
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,260
It just nobody does it

609
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,139
It's pineapple ice cream pineapple soft serve

610
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,480
Why do why is it only at fucking disney?

611
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,119
Yuck ban that person. I'm not even kidding. I want you to ban them for at least a minute

612
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:29,059
Make your own. Yeah, but it's pain in the ass

613
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,449
Make my own ice cream

614
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:38,039
All right. What do I got here? I need 30 followers. I'm just gonna post some photos

615
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:47,139
I love your photos, but wait until tomorrow. All right, fine. Uh, i'm gonna leave the area

616
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,570
Wait, I need to save the photos

617
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,360
Some of these are really good. I don't want to get rid of. Oh, yeah

618
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,269
Some of these are gonna be huge on dognet

619
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:10,179
Okay, mango dole. Yeah, that one's good, too

620
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:27,610
All right. Some of these would be big. What about what's the shop? All right, what's the best disney ride?

621
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,010
I'm gonna tell you right now

622
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,210
I actually don't even care about the rides

623
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,650
I'm gonna give you a tip a disney and any theme park tip really especially like a disney place

624
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:44,809
I I just kind of like looking at stuff

625
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:53,530
I like going to the shops and eating the food and walking around and looking at all the statues and stuff

626
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,599
The rides they're good. I mean prior to the caribbean ride is pretty pretty pog right at least at disney land

627
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,719
But I don't know. I don't sitting in

628
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,039
The line and usually waiting sometimes like an hour to get on the ride

629
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,639
I i've just i'm so

630
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,780
I just hate it

631
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,090
Yeah, I would rather just be an npc

632
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:27,179
No, that's that's fair. It is

633
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:29,179
No, you're that's right. I'd rather just be an npc

634
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,619
disney loves

635
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:42,360
germa customers

636
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:53,239
Wait, this is weird. Hold on

637
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,780
Jesus

638
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,940
That was a good one. I actually think this one's gonna be this one's gonna go really hard on dognet

639
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:10,170
Of course it is got it 30 followers. Wait, what I heard there's some killer waves

640
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Oh, it's a new day. So it's okay

641
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:20,250
Let's go to the boardwalk

642
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,130
Uh, no, I okay. So here here's here's my reasoning

643
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,469
When you walk when you walk around and you look at how long some of these rides take to get on

644
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,659
Oh, yeah, the the haunted mansion

645
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:33,860
80 minutes

646
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,260
Prior to the caribbean 40 to 50 minutes

647
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,539
Oh, this ride's about 40 minutes to wait and and the rides are two to four minutes long

648
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
You are deleting

649
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,599
Sometimes four plus to five plus hours per day

650
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:52,440
waiting in line

651
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,739
I would rather

652
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,739
Pick what are you doing?

653
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,000
I can't read this

654
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,980
What's your favorite topping for mac and cheese ass because i'm preparing my 40th birthday party and it's gonna be germa themed

655
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:11,340
Then I want to serve mac and cheese. I want to make sure it's it's germtastic enough for my guests to enjoy

656
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,699
I already have all the decorations ready. They're all your face and this this this is like a blocked word

657
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,349
This literally is like a a deleted word. I can't I don't even I don't know what it says

658
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:26,949
I'm also giving out little uh plush dachshunds. They're auto. We're going to watch every germa rumble in the dollhouse dream

659
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,510
That's my favorite, uh breadcrumbs

660
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:36,360
Bread crumbs, it's easy. Anything else is weird

661
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:41,349
bread crumbs

662
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:42,469
boring

663
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:49,510
Oh, it said butthole

664
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,150
Anyways, um, so here's my here's my reasoning for this

665
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:57,739
I would rather pick one or two things that I want to do

666
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:04,570
And go do it they introduced this new thing and I am sorry, but it sucks

667
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,820
It's like the genie plus

668
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,000
It's the new fast pass, but it's just like a confusing fucking mess

669
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,809
I just

670
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,809
Just like what the fuck is this?

671
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,949
So, I don't know. I don't think we even used it

672
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:28,250
It was just like oh you have to decide what ride you want to go on

673
01:00:28,489 --> 01:00:32,090
When you get there and you have to be in the park and then plan your day

674
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,730
You're like you like plan your day

675
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:37,289
around the genie plus and I don't

676
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:40,730
What the fuck are you talking about?

677
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,610
but

678
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:45,530
Uh, so waiting in in line for rides you pick the one or two per day that you want to do

679
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:49,369
And you eat six doll whips and puke when you get back to the fucking hotel room

680
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:54,900
And walk around and look at all the stuff

681
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:04,150
Don't actually eat six doll whips. Oh, okay. I'm I gotta tell you I

682
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:07,320
Paul are you in the chat holly?

683
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,079
Was it three?

684
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:12,679
How many when we were there that night that we were there did I have two or three?

685
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:19,369
Was it three doll whips over the course of like four or five hours?

686
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:24,980
How many did I eat?

687
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,760
Oh, you also helped eat mine too

688
01:01:29,929 --> 01:01:31,929
Like three and a half four

689
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,539
Yeah, and guess what? It was great walked around ate doll whip

690
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:42,309
and

691
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:43,829
looked at all like the

692
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:46,550
shops and was it npc for a little while

693
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:50,219
rode pirates of the caribbean

694
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,820
and

695
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,699
You know, all right something about disneyland that you guys this is fucking hilarious

696
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,760
So, uh the winnie the pooh ride at disneyland

697
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,739
Is always a zero minute wait always zero

698
01:02:02,539 --> 01:02:04,389
Zero

699
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:06,389
It's you could just go on it whenever you want

700
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:12,570
It is the shittiest ride at the park, but it's who cares

701
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:16,789
I rode that

702
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:19,929
It's not even that bad either

703
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:23,579
Okay, we got

704
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:27,739
Got the surfing dog

705
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:36,139
How do I sneak into the arcade?

706
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,150
Also like in line

707
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,909
for the winnie the pooh ride

708
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:47,349
I remember just being like just being holly. I'm just being like, oh, hey ma'am. So yeah, i'm glad we got into this line

709
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:52,630
Yeah, it's good that we use the genie plus on this like i've this is always swarmed. Just like talk is saying it

710
01:02:57,019 --> 01:02:59,019
You just I can feel the eye rolls

01:02:59,739 --> 01:03:08,090
All right. Let me play the game

712
01:03:08,090 --> 01:03:11,670
All right old arcade

713
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:16,869
Oh my god, disneyland also has these cream cheese filled pretzels. Holy shit. I don't want to tell anybody about this

714
01:03:18,389 --> 01:03:21,750
I don't want to tell anybody because then because then you'll all go get it and I won't be able to get it anymore

715
01:03:24,619 --> 01:03:26,619
Yeah, there's like one place

716
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:33,260
Okay, there's one place in disneyland that you can they move it around. It's a secret. Fuck. I just told you the secret i'm an idiot

717
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:39,300
This is actually like a disneyland secret and I just fucking told you and I feel like an idiot now

718
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,380
It's like now the line is going to be long

719
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,380
They have a cream cheese filled pretzel and it's literally one of the best things i've ever eaten in my entire life

720
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:57,019
And I don't even know where it is because they change where it is every single day

721
01:03:57,739 --> 01:04:01,179
The cream cheese mickey mouse pretzel is the best thing in the world. Yeah

722
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,900
and great

723
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,380
Now we're gonna go back to disneyland and that line's gonna be an hour fucking long

724
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,380
And they're all gonna be sitting there talking about each other talking to each other. Oh, man, you know, this is a secret

725
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,619
Don't tell anybody this it's like I

726
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,940
I fucking told you

727
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:23,940
how

728
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,940
How do I get into the arcade?

729
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:37,130
Around the back sneak into the arcade

730
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:50,969
How do I get in here? Yeah, I go to disney for the food

731
01:04:53,780 --> 01:05:00,659
That's so funny. I'm really the guy in roller coaster tycoon that walks in pays the the and you make the fee to get in

732
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:07,460
Expensive i'm the one that walks in has a bunch of money in my pocket. I walk around buy a pretzel and leave

733
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:36,699
How'd you get up here?

734
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,170
Oh

735
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,849
This is the

736
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,340
What the fuck how do I get into the arcade?

737
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:53,510
Yeah, cream cheese pretzel is one of the best things at disney

738
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:56,150
Without a doubt

739
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:03,269
How do I get in here?

740
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:07,059
No, help. I figured it would've been on the roof

741
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,260
Uh, I do have to get that so i'm gonna go back

742
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:19,860
Double jump in this game. That's kind of insane

743
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:23,269
All right arcade. So well, come on. There's got to be a way to get in here

744
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:32,230
Right like back here

745
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:46,630
If I saw somebody do that on the boardwalk, I would fucking freak out

746
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,019
Okay

747
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:55,820
Sports and dogs what's not to love. I have a photo request. Give me a pic of two dogs playing with a disc

748
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,820
I've heard it. This is a common activity. Okay

749
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,940
The disc right there

750
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:14,570
You're gonna go get it

751
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:24,019
Ready somebody get it

752
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:27,480
There it is

753
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,980
There it is 100 percent

754
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,940
Why is your face in italics today?

755
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:38,489
Because I have a crooked face

756
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:39,690
Get over it

757
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,599
All right, submit a photo

758
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:51,059
The dog has to be centered in the photograph and facing the camera for a photo to be considered professional quality

759
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:54,949
That's not the one I wanted to give this photo is bad

760
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,829
What about the rule of thirds?

761
01:07:57,829 --> 01:08:04,230
I didn't want to submit this one

762
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:09,539
Oh, I got the selfie device

763
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,710
Selfie mode

764
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:22,149
Wait, what i'm the camera

765
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,739
Okay, that just I was so confused

766
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,930
I thought the camera was floating in front of my face, but that this is weird. All right

767
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:53,109
This thing is scary

768
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:54,789
All right, 40 followers

769
01:08:54,789 --> 01:09:03,800
42

770
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,609
Finally some good non-dog content. I really like that

771
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:22,420
Okay, help clean up the skate park

772
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:28,729
Cool. Let's turn that selfie off

773
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,460
This game's cute. I like it

774
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:37,739
Okay, so now

775
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:45,720
Clean up the skate park

776
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,109
skate park

777
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:54,380
Where's that?

778
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:57,899
Why does he always address holly like a spirit in his house?

779
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,640
holly

780
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,000
You can hear me

781
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:11,100
Hello, germ. My wife's been preparing a birthday. All right, just delete that

782
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:20,390
Okay. Now that I think about like pretzels and shit

783
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:23,539
I if it was like a

784
01:10:23,539 --> 01:10:25,539
I found out I got it

785
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:28,739
I'm trying to think of like a food item that I would present to the aliens

786
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:35,140
When they landed like we had to come together and be like this is the thing that is the best thing in all of humanity

787
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:37,380
This is the greatest food

788
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,779
This is the greatest thing that we could possibly do to eat

789
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,300
Because they're going to judge us on it

790
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,510
It would be a hot pretzel

791
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,909
And I think that we would the planet would be spared

792
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,630
It would be a hot

793
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,090
crispy

794
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:55,529
Soft on the inside a hot huge pretzel salt

795
01:10:56,409 --> 01:10:58,409
a hot thing of like beer cheese

796
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:01,930
And honey mustard and it would and they would they would be

797
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,890
It would be fine. I think it's a single greatest food invention of all humanity

798
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:11,859
I think uh, that's like the the greatest thing i've ever had in my life

799
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:20,500
fuck beer cheese

800
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,859
Or you know, we could just like cheddar or something just cheese like hot cheese

801
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:35,939
Okay

802
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:40,680
Arcade's open now. Wait, what can I play a game?

803
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:51,829
If I were the alien i'd leave if the people that are writing gross we're talking about like a hot pretzel

804
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:56,699
You you you're doing like a troll face in real life

805
01:11:57,819 --> 01:11:59,819
I don't think there's a human on earth

806
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:03,420
I don't think there's a person that's alive on earth right now

807
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,479
that

808
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:07,479
Doesn't but does not like

809
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Like I would turn down a hot pretzel

810
01:12:10,279 --> 01:12:12,279
I don't I can't imagine anybody would ever do that

811
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:22,819
If you're hungry and you know, I've got snacks and I go. Hey, I got hot pretzels. You'd be like what? Oh, okay. Nice

812
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,380
Really nice. Yes

813
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,020
Like if I said, oh, yeah, i've got yogurt

814
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,060
I mean some of you might be like, oh nice, but a lot of you might be like, yeah

815
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:41,050
Not really into that

816
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:48,840
If a hot pretzel everybody would I don't think anybody doesn't like that pretzels taste like ass. I just they just they don't

817
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:53,859
put frog in here

818
01:12:54,260 --> 01:13:14,949
I'm posting this one pretzels demonstrate our advance in agriculture and cultivation. That's true

819
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:30,819
That actually is true. I mean it would be but okay. So I think when he said pizza

820
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:34,420
I don't know. I've had some really bad pizza before

821
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,989
And it's definitely I don't think I would want to give the aliens something that's gonna give them diarrhea

822
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:45,189
Right. So anything else that you could think of?

823
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,359
Pretzels not going to give you diarrhea

824
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:51,000
But like a really bad pizza might because of grease and stuff

825
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:57,159
Or like burger like we wouldn't want to give the aliens burger king because what if they have diarrhea feel like why do they eat this?

826
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:18,789
That was a cool photo where's the skate park?

827
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:24,630
Uh-huh

828
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:29,670
Oh here it is. Okay, clean up the trash dumpster over here somewhere

829
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,680
You wouldn't want to feed the alien something that was going to give it a gastric upset

830
01:14:49,739 --> 01:14:51,739
Pretzels are plain enough

831
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:54,460
And but they wouldn't upset your stomach or anything

832
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,699
No, I would not give the aliens water burger. It's too much

833
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:04,939
Think about it an alien has not had like fucking pizza grease before

834
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:07,739
It's gonna taste it and it's probably gonna shit its pants

835
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,600
Taco Bell

836
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,359
But you would give them beer cheese. No, I didn't say I was gonna give the aliens beer cheese

837
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,840
I said I would that I would prefer beer cheese with that

838
01:15:35,859 --> 01:15:41,220
What if the aliens can't process the um, I think I cleaned it up, right? This is good

839
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:46,020
Oh, is it more trash?

840
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:51,579
Oh, hello

841
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:53,300
um

842
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:56,760
Yeah, you'd have to be what's plain enough

843
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,689
That but is no because i'm telling you what if aliens probably eat

844
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:04,899
We don't know what their digestive tract is like

845
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:07,779
They might not be able to handle like a cheeseburger

846
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:12,409
Banana, oh, that's boring though

847
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:16,390
a baked potato

848
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:20,229
That's like kind of plain

849
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:23,829
Crisp apple actually, you know what? That might be the that might be the one

850
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:29,430
I don't think you can get yeah, like just like a fresh apple

851
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:35,109
You don't start the aliens with the cheesy goatee to crunch

852
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,060
The alien would be like take a bite out of it

853
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:44,859
Cheesy goatee to crunch. Okay. Let's see. This is what you are here giving us for food

854
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:47,659
And it's you said the best that you okay

855
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,859
Yeah

856
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:55,779
They're gonna like shit and then they're gonna take their laser gun out and point it at you and like

857
01:16:56,739 --> 01:17:00,739
Liquidate you and then that starts the fucking war because they're gonna think you poisoned them

858
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:07,079
Way too much fat too much grease, right and I trust me. I love these things

859
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,960
Spicy ranch would take them out

860
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:18,170
Apple would be probably fine. Whoa

861
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:27,289
Give him a ghost pepper. They would think they would see that as an act of war is what you don't understand

862
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,859
They would think that this was poison and you were trying to like kill one of their alien ambassadors

863
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:36,020
It's an act of war

864
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:39,220
Give them one single talkie

865
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:51,300
Oh, you need a photo. Okay

866
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:55,829
Skate park is now open

867
01:17:55,829 --> 01:17:57,699
Of course

868
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:02,779
Oh

869
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:12,300
That looks like it hurt

870
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,220
Holy shit. Hold on

871
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:41,829
I mean I got it and what about fluids too? All right

872
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:44,869
So we figured out like an apple would probably the best thing for the to give them first

873
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,670
Would it be just water?

874
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,670
I feel like water is not impressive though

875
01:18:54,789 --> 01:18:59,750
Give him a mountain dew. No, that's all that would also be like it like an act of war. I think it'd be like

876
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,220
some kind of tea

877
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:11,930
milk

878
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:15,449
Maybe like a lemonade actually that might be look strawberry. What'd you say?

879
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,710
Strawberry banana smoothie actually that might be a good one

880
01:19:24,949 --> 01:19:27,500
You put a red bull

881
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
They're not used to caffeine

882
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,979
They don't know what caffeine is and it's like they take one sip of the red bull. They got oh sort of tart

883
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:37,500
What do you call this again?

884
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,819
Their fucking heads explode

885
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:51,340
It has to we have to be careful. I gotta go rest right

886
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:57,189
sour warheads

887
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:01,939
No as an act of war

888
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:18,229
I actually like this one a lot. What do you think the aliens would give us?

889
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:21,579
I don't know

890
01:20:21,579 --> 01:20:39,720
See, I there's no way to know because I don't know. I don't have any of their experiences. Okay gain 150 followers

891
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:43,899
The dogs drive cars

892
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:48,760
Is there a dog driving this car?

893
01:20:50,739 --> 01:20:52,739
Holy shit. Oh my god

894
01:20:53,220 --> 01:21:01,670

a photo of a duck

902
01:21:46,649 --> 01:21:51,130
Safety records are lacking. We need a photo of a dog with a fire hydrant. I already have one. Oh, I don't

903
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:58,779
Okay, so I need a photo of a duck a photo of the shop

904
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:17,880
Down here, what if we give the aliens edibles? No, that's an act of war

905
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:24,630
That's cute. Okay, is this the store?

906
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,399
Nice

907
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,279
And 150 followers

908
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:36,359
Can I buy a bone?

Do you want one? Who wants a bone? Here. I'm trying to put i'm trying to get a funny photo where the oh

910
01:22:52,420 --> 01:23:03,060
Well, that's funny. We could make that no

911
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,979
Anything where the alien would feel different?

912
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:10,380
Would be

913
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,500
A why did you what did you what did you what do you what why do I feel like this?

914
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,760
And then that's when they would start shooting us with lasers

915
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:54,439
Yeah, i'm posting this one just give him gas station sushi just give him one single olive

916
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,840
I'm telling you a hot pretzel is the way to go

917
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,720
All right photo of a duck

918
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:05,399
I'm sitting by the water maybe

919
01:24:05,979 --> 01:24:07,899
dog with a fire hydrant

920
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:28,970
Oh, i'm gonna take a picture of a stocks chart or something noodles actually might be a big deal

921
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:32,739
just noodles

922
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:35,380
right feels like like a

923
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:41,670
Like a cup noodle like instant ramen. Yeah, I think instant ramen might be a good one to put in there

924
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:43,350
one apple

925
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:46,100
instant ramen

926
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:49,460
Because because like cup noodle and the instant ramen stuff

927
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,220
Is very very palatable. It's not

928
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,489
It just tastes nice

929
01:24:56,489 --> 01:24:59,529
It just tastes nice. It's like a broth right with the noodles

930
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:02,409
We don't want to freak them out

931
01:25:02,649 --> 01:25:24,090
I mean that was cool

932
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:25,529
That was fun

933
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:27,720
good job

934
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,609
spaghetti

935
01:25:29,609 --> 01:25:34,970
I don't know. I think the tomato sauce would be a little would be like an active war

936
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:50,260
Grilled chicken

937
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:51,859
Yeah

938
01:25:51,859 --> 01:25:53,859
just grilled seared

939
01:25:54,420 --> 01:26:06,460
Chicken breast sliced a grilled cheese grilled cheese might be pretty good. Yeah

940
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:10,039
You got to think of stuff that is very very

941
01:26:10,819 --> 01:26:13,239
Palatable chicken nuggets, maybe

942
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:19,319
honestly

943
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:23,800
It's what it's like the little kid diet is what we're gonna give to aliens

944
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,390
mac and cheese

945
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:30,229
apples

946
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:32,229
chicken nuggets

947
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:34,949
Like noodles

948
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:36,949
But it's but that's why though, right?

949
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,470
Like little kids can sometimes be really picky eaters

950
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:43,829
And those are all very very plain very palatable

951
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:57,380
I can dress up the dogs

952
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:05,239
Cheese strings. Yep

953
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:08,760
Literally anything from this planet would be poison to aliens. I don't think so

954
01:27:12,409 --> 01:27:13,850
takes a lens

955
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,470
Can I buy another lens?

956
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,470
I need uh, this is if there's other lenses

957
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:25,000
Okay, let's get the uh, where's this weird thing?

958
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Here

959
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:31,989
The charts with the up and down lines i've lost them this should be on an easel near a picnic bench

960
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:34,390
That doesn't give me very much

961
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:43,460
Watch out. Why am I moving in real life? It's like a cute dog game

962
01:27:45,380 --> 01:28:05,739
This is the inception music

963
01:28:15,859 --> 01:28:39,899
You did such a good job painting that painting. Here's a delicious shit for you. That's a good one

964
01:28:44,579 --> 01:28:46,579
This one's going on dognet

965
01:28:47,220 --> 01:29:02,779
Is this like me branching out to other animals

966
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,760
Like oh, I know stog net but like

967
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:09,800
Maybe taking pictures of birds now as well

968
01:29:22,949 --> 01:29:35,989
That one was popular. I like this one. All right, so now

969
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:39,319
Find the business cat's chart

970
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,779
There's a niche

971
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:53,050
duck community

972
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,810
What about music?

973
01:29:54,810 --> 01:30:01,800
Would you introduce breakcore to aliens? No, I think I would start with a snare drum

974
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:04,729
I would just get this into a room

975
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:08,250
Like okay here like everyone relax. We're all relaxing. I'm just hanging out

976
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:11,130
There's a there's a drum in here one snare drum

977
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:16,170
And there's two of us in the room two of the aliens and I want to show you what let's show you this

978
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:18,729
just watch ready like

979
01:30:22,489 --> 01:30:25,689
And they'll they're gonna put the back against the wall and they're gonna be fucking terrified and

980
01:30:26,409 --> 01:30:28,329
I mean just very slow

981
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:33,130
and i'll be like you you do too, right like

982
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,970
See kinetic energy

983
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,319
I don't think you go full on a band

984
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:42,840
No

985
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,840
And not electric guitar either

986
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:49,350
It's one snare drum

987
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,039
And then maybe a flute

988
01:30:52,039 --> 01:30:54,409
just like

989
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:59,340
That's it and then just let's just relax because it's gonna be a lot for them

990
01:31:02,359 --> 01:31:04,520
And then I say you

991
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:07,479
pop hop hop

992
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,119
You that and they go oh

993
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,720
Oh

994
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,409
And then I go

995
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:18,250
And then it's that's music that's what we call music

996
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:24,460
And then you can give them a cd of fucking your favorite atlantis more set songs. You know what I mean?

997
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:27,500
Then you give them a cd of all the blink 182 albums you have

998
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:30,300
And then they'll figure it out, right?

999
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:36,789
Then you give them the slipknot album

1000
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:49,979
Okay, so where I gotta find a park bench

1001
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:58,869
Picnic bench now, that's one big hydrant

1002
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:09,909
Now all you guys that want to have

1003
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:12,229
big band

1004
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:14,069
No, there's too many instruments. It's like

1005
01:32:15,909 --> 01:32:18,069
Like there's too many sounds that they've never heard before

1006
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:25,319
You guys want to have a full drum set a saxophone a flute a cello player

1007
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,520
Two electric guitars a piano they would you they wouldn't be able to handle it

1008
01:32:32,649 --> 01:32:34,649
You got to start very slow

1009
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:49,899
At this that is a cool picture

1010
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,380
Maybe some lounge jazz. Uh, yeah, that's what I would go to next

1011
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:57,659
It's very very light smooth jazz

1012
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,800
I'm talking like the the hey Arnold background music. That's the kind of stuff that I would level them up to

1013
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:07,159
Just that kind of like

1014
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:21,800
I can't find this

1015
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:26,789
A picnic bench would be like in the park. I guess that's what I think

1016
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:37,079
I mean, this is a picnic bench and there is a cheeseburger here

1017
01:33:42,579 --> 01:33:45,060
They mastered space travel, but they can't handle a drum set

1018
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,560
cheeseburg people happy

1019
01:33:53,539 --> 01:34:01,130

1021
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:18,760

But let me I gotta find this

1047

Painting whatever it is

1048
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:55,449
How do I get the new camera parts?

1049
01:38:55,449 --> 01:38:59,130
Have you ever played the new spider-man games? Um, I streamed the

1050
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:04,300
The new spider-man game that came out. It was ps4 exclusive

1051
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:09,899
Like the spider-man game. I didn't play the the new ps5 one though that I have ps5

1052
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:19,420
Yeah, five years ago

1053
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:23,100
Miles morales one is really good. It looks it it looks good, but I have to get a ps5

1054
01:39:23,739 --> 01:39:25,739
I have to be i'm gonna tell you something right now

1055
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:31,350
Like every time I want like is every time I want to get a ps5. I just can't

1056
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:40,260
It's on pc

1057
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:49,989
Oh, i'll be really really honest. I know if some of you I don't want to be like, oh, it's the console war. Here we go

1058
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:52,710
What's even on ps5?

1059
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:55,109
Besides demon souls, which is the reason to buy the console, right?

1060
01:39:56,069 --> 01:40:00,630
What's on ps5? That's like an exclusive that's worth getting the console for

1061
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:04,310
Because i'll be very very completely upfront. I have to be incredibly honest with you

1062
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:07,109
the xbox game pass

1063
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:10,069
Is actually kind of fucking unbeatable. It's actually amazing

1064
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:19,770
Like I have found so many games through game pass just because they're ready to play they're right there

1065
01:40:20,409 --> 01:40:21,449
and

1066
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:24,250
80 of them, you don't even have to install them. You just play them in the cloud

1067
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:28,390
i'm being dead serious about that

1068
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,619
and

1069
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:34,739
Games like service type shit like that. I'm not bullshit. Yeah, I wouldn't bullshit

1070
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:38,100
The games as a service type stuff

1071
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:42,739
think about like the switch like the oh we're gonna release games, uh, like the

1072
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:48,180
The snes and n64 type shit. Yeah, maybe once every two fucking months. You'll see something

1073
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:54,819
X there are at least three to five new games on game pass. It feels like every couple fucking weeks

1074
01:40:55,779 --> 01:40:59,369
I'm dead serious

1075
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:02,729
They load that shit up all the time. It's actually awesome

1076
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:13,930
He's bullshitting us. No, i'm tell I just told you I wasn't

1077
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:21,850
Can you play dark messiah might magic? I already screamed it. The game is amazing. All right. Where is this stupid thing?

1078
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:25,050
I have to find this this picnic bench

1079
01:41:26,659 --> 01:41:28,659
This person has like stocks all over it

1080
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:44,140
I shouldn't have done that into the street

1081
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:48,199
They remove them too, don't they?

1082
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:50,439
So games will cycle through it

1083
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:54,170
um

1084
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:58,569
They have I think like a hundred something games that are always getting kind of cycled through

1085
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:09,340
But they're there for long enough where you can just play them. I actually think you I think you can install some of them, too

1086
01:42:11,909 --> 01:42:13,909
There are a few constraints. Yeah

1087
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,890
Yeah, the okay playstation now

1088
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:19,590
was

1089
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:20,710
garbage

1090
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:23,750
It was garbage. I remember trying to use it

1091
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,390
It didn't fucking work

1092
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:30,229
I got disconnected like 70 percent of the time when I used it. It was trash

1093
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:37,029
It was absolute trash and i'm I really hate to say that because I like sony's games and I like I like playstation

1094
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:41,659
this xbox, um cloud service

1095
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:48,229
Is like everything that stadia wanted to be and it just works and it's better in every conceivable way every conceivable way

1096
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:51,270
Is it better now?

1097
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:56,710
When I tried to use it a few years ago, it was like this is like why i'm even trying

1098
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:07,449
All right. I'm just gonna reset

1099
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:22,390
It's better now copium. It might be it was bad before i'm trying to play red dead redemption

1100
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:27,340
I think oh my god. I'm getting a flashback

1101
01:43:27,979 --> 01:43:31,460
You guys remember when I told you about that time when I was like screaming in the car

1102
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:35,659
And I like forgot my credit card

1103
01:43:35,739 --> 01:43:40,579
Like I went to like walmart or something and I forgot my credit card

1104
01:43:40,659 --> 01:43:43,939
I I couldn't get the game to run on the xbox or something

1105
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:50,229
And I was like screaming going back and forth in the car, right?

1106
01:43:52,569 --> 01:43:57,529
And then I tried to just I tried just to play it on ps now and it just disconnected every 15 seconds

1107
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:04,439
Then I just turned the stream off

1108
01:44:04,439 --> 01:44:08,199
That might have been the worst stream like ever. That's probably the worst stream i've ever done

1109
01:44:09,939 --> 01:44:17,289
Yeah, 100

1110
01:44:17,289 --> 01:44:21,449
It was so awful. It was just so painful. Everything was awful. Everything sucked that day

1111
01:44:21,529 --> 01:44:25,750
It was just so bad

1112
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:31,380
Oh, I know what that is

1113
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:35,739
It was your first collab with vinny too. That's right

1114
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:45,659

1115
01:44:51,979 --> 01:44:53,979
Uh, two dogs with bones

And find the business cat. All right, the playgrounds over here

Actually, I can buy the bones

1119
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:14,489
playtime activities

1120
01:45:14,489 --> 01:45:28,380
This is a playtime activity two dogs with bones

1121
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,119
Okay, so I need to get some bones

1122
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:44,659
Come over here thought that was a chicken. All right, let's get the bones over here

Okay, there's one and you want one too look over here snowflake snowflake snowflake look over here snowflake

1124
01:46:14,819 --> 01:46:27,659
85 followers picnic bench. Okay. Is this a picnic bench?

1125
01:46:28,539 --> 01:46:30,539
Or is a picnic bench a picnic table?

1126
01:46:36,279 --> 01:46:38,119
This is like a picnic

1127
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:41,989
Bench a picnic table is a picnic table, right?

1128
01:46:44,970 --> 01:47:03,939
All right, I just need followers now, what's this?

1129
01:47:05,369 --> 01:47:06,810
Oh doll web

1130
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:17,180
Should I post the stocks?

1131
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:24,260
How long did it take me to line this up? Not long at all

1132
01:47:24,979 --> 01:47:31,420
All right 85

1133
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:39,319
All right, there's a hidden envelope. I love the flip

1134
01:47:40,789 --> 01:47:42,789
Do you guys remember those little dog toys?

1135
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:45,670
They were kind of scary

1136
01:47:45,909 --> 01:47:49,989
Where it was a little dog was it was it looked like a stuffed animal, but it was hard

1137
01:47:51,029 --> 01:47:53,029
And it was like

1138
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:57,850
And then this thing

1139
01:47:57,850 --> 01:48:02,670
Went snap and did a full backflip. It was kind of terrifying

1140
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:09,829
I'm just i'm bringing myself back to an era with a bunch of weird

1141
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,350
animal like mechanical toys like that

1142
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:17,109
Do you remember there was like the little gopher or the like a ferret?

1143
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:20,550
There was a ball and it just kind of rolled around with the ball

1144
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:25,989
Yeah, and they would always be in this little playpen at the mall

1145
01:48:26,949 --> 01:48:28,550
There was a store

1146
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:32,789
And in the front of the store was like a little it probably was about chest high

1147
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:36,789
And it was a circle area that they put all this shit in

1148
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:41,750
They put two flipping dogs three ferret balls two like cat things

1149
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,539
And they would always fall out. They would always flip out of the thing and always fall out of the thing

1150
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:50,460
I wonder how hard it would be to track one of those down

1151
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:53,979
They were violent

1152
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,829
Hamsters

1153
01:49:03,829 --> 01:49:08,390
Yeah

1154
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:15,989
They still sell those at flea markets and you could hear it across the mall. Yes, you really could

1155
01:49:16,869 --> 01:49:18,869
You could you would be

1156
01:49:19,829 --> 01:49:21,909
60 meters you'd be a hundred meters away

1157
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:24,550
and all you would hear would be like

1158
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:26,550
Oh

1159
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:39,850
That's all you could hear I completely forgot that you could actually hear it

1160
01:49:46,789 --> 01:49:48,310
How much is a meter?

1161
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:50,310
a meter is

1162
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:53,050
A yard is three feet

1163
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:55,210
a meter

1164
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:57,210
One yard is three feet

1165
01:49:58,539 --> 01:50:00,539
So that means a meter

1166
01:50:00,619 --> 01:50:03,260
is two

1167
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,260
Point two pounds. That's a kilo

1168
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,220
Um

1169
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:09,979
a meter is

1170
01:50:09,979 --> 01:50:13,020

Yeah, okay. I don't know meters to kilometers. I could dodge a fucking battle axe

1188
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:48,649
Who gives a shit?

01:52:48,649 --> 01:52:50,649
I don't think you guys understand like who cares

1190
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:56,739
You don't know what a meter to kilometers to then to uh, micro meters

1191
01:52:56,899 --> 01:53:02,899
Uh, then uh do that deduce that to yards. No, but I could dodge a battle axe and uh, you can't

1192
01:53:03,539 --> 01:53:11,510
And i'll prove it to you

1193

1205
01:54:40,649 --> 01:54:46,170
I'm busy. I don't have time to think about how what a kilometer is what a what a fucked up question

1206
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,220
Like imagine you sitting there

1207
01:54:50,939 --> 01:54:54,859
Okay, imagine you're sitting there and somebody just kind of walks up to you busy. I'm just like hey

01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,899
What's kilometer?

1209
01:54:57,899 --> 01:55:01,500
It's like I don't know frank fucking leave me alone. Like i'm busy

1210
01:55:02,539 --> 01:55:07,210
I'd be like, what are you asking of how what how much is it?

1211
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,250
What is kilo greek? Is that what you're asking?

1212
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:16,170
What do you what question why you want? How much is a kilometer frank? It's a distance of some kind

1213
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:29,640
You're a himbo

1214
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:48,329
Fine. I need I want to buy this new stuff. You are a substitute teacher. You don't guys I don't need to have

1215
01:55:49,210 --> 01:55:51,210
I don't substitute teaching was

1216
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:55,149
Essentially me like just keeping the classroom

1217
01:55:55,930 --> 01:56:00,970
In order it wasn't like oh by the way students a kilometer is a thousand kilometers

1218
01:56:01,289 --> 01:56:05,289
And a millimeter is a million. No, it was just a I honestly was

1219
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:08,569
It was just just to make sure like the students behaved

1220
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:32,180
millicenti

1221
01:56:32,439 --> 01:56:35,000
One one thousand one one hundred. Yeah, I know

1222
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:38,140
Do you think I need to know that for this?

1223
01:56:39,029 --> 01:56:41,029
Do I need to know what a millimeter?

1224
01:56:41,750 --> 01:56:43,750
To ounces is

1225
01:56:44,569 --> 01:56:46,170
And fuck everybody

1226
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:47,449
Fuck everybody

1227
01:56:47,449 --> 01:56:50,489
You definitely still type into google. Um

1228
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:58,649
Ounces to uh to liters everybody does don't even don't even pretend don't pretend

1229
01:57:00,659 --> 01:57:04,260
You still type google ounces to liters, um conversion

1230
01:57:05,220 --> 01:57:07,220
And you type it in and because you don't know

1231
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:10,180
Don't even tell me

1232
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:12,420
Don't even tell me you don't do that. I don't believe it

1233
01:57:20,949 --> 01:57:22,310
What's an ounce

1234
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:32,420
He looks so cute

1235
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:35,619
All right. I gotta uh leave the i'm gonna go to this other there's other quests in the other area

1236
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:39,399
The different measurement units, dude

1237
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:49,819
Cognitive dissonance danny

1238
01:57:49,819 --> 01:58:05,020
All metric is easy. It's just times 10. Yo heard tony bark is in town. I'm really busy trying to stop a different

1239
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,500
Uh skate park from getting demolished

1240
01:58:07,899 --> 01:58:09,899
Can you give me a shot of him shredding the pipe?

1241
01:58:10,539 --> 01:58:16,819
Okay, the old arcade is open again haven't heard if it's getting used though. Can you find out for me?

1242
01:58:17,539 --> 01:58:21,319
It's definitely getting used. Take a look

1243
01:58:22,039 --> 01:58:27,020
Place is bumping

1244
01:58:27,020 --> 01:58:42,819
Oh close up of a dog at the arcade looks pretty good. That's a good photo. What's your favorite photo?

1245
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:53,560
Um

1246
01:58:53,560 --> 01:59:08,890
That one's better

1247
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:13,449
Hey kid, you got some real talent. I can see that but your photos they're severely lacking in the fear department

1248
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:17,989
Unleash me from the vending machine. I can show you a new world of expression. All I have to do is watch

1249
01:59:18,630 --> 01:59:29,300
Okay, what oh there's tony bark, all right, I gotta get him

1250
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:38,729

Got it

1252
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,880
Uh, okay, there's new stuff in the

1253
02:00:27,529 --> 02:00:34,739
Wait, what's wrong? What's wrong?

1254
02:00:34,739 --> 02:00:59,770
Didn't I get it? Oh, that's I don't like that's sad

1255
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:08,500
Oh, no

1256
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:09,220
um

1257
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:12,170
Tony said you're gonna play frog detective not today

1258
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:14,659
I'm very sick

1259
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:18,520
Well, not very sick

1260
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:20,779
It's okay

1261
02:01:20,779 --> 02:01:22,220
Wait, where'd you go?

1262
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:25,979
I want to make sure you know that it's okay. Where are you? Oh, it's okay. Don't worry

1263
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:30,569
Um, i'm like, oh i'm very sick. No i'm

1264
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:32,649
I'm sick

1265
02:01:32,649 --> 02:01:35,529
I have like a sinus cold. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's happening

1266
02:01:36,649 --> 02:01:38,649
I have a bunch of pressure here

1267
02:01:39,399 --> 02:01:41,159
My throat's all fucked up

1268
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:43,159
And my ears are popped

1269
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:44,600
so

1270
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,840
Um, I wanted to stream though. I didn't want to just not stream

1271
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:51,880
Because I feel like i've been away from the computer for a while wanted to at least hang out for a bit

1272
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:56,380
I tested for covid already a few times. So

1273
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:01,260
It is not covid

1274
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:04,619
But I don't know maybe who knows i'll test again tomorrow or tonight

1275
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:10,140
Uh, if I get worse then I i'm just gonna stream tomorrow, but we'll see

1276
02:02:14,329 --> 02:02:16,329
I need more. I need 150 followers

1277
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:23,140
It could be a different virus

1278
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:24,739
Sync up

1279
02:02:24,739 --> 02:02:27,220
I'm all right. I'm good

1280
02:02:27,220 --> 02:02:30,979
I just took I feel actually okay right now because i've been taking this um

1281
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:32,760
Um

1282
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:33,960
This like

1283
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,960
Tylenol cold and flu thing

1284
02:02:36,359 --> 02:02:38,920
Essentially, it just kind of pumping myself up

1285
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,560
It's like the cold medicine

1286
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:44,760
Um, i'll be fine though. Don't worry

1287
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,739
It's it's just literally just thick probably a cold

1288
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,739
But if I change this by tomorrow, I'll let you know

1289
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:54,680
all right, I need

1290
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:58,710
100 I just need 150 followers

1291
02:02:58,789 --> 02:03:04,789
I'm 35. They like that one plus three

1292
02:03:12,010 --> 02:03:13,050
Oh

1293
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:16,380
There it is to the moon

1294
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:21,159
We love the moon

1295
02:03:21,159 --> 02:03:23,159
I unlocked the moon

1296
02:03:30,779 --> 02:03:33,500
One inch is about two and a half centimeters. So it's not a huge difference

1297
02:03:36,069 --> 02:03:41,029
You know, it's kind of funny. I've talked so much shit about how how there should be a standard

1298
02:03:41,829 --> 02:03:43,829
buttons on all controllers

1299
02:03:43,989 --> 02:03:45,989
Because remember I said oh pressing a

1300
02:03:46,949 --> 02:03:49,909
Is annoying because if I press a on an xbox i'm actually pressing b

1301
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:52,550
on a nintendo

1302
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:53,350
or

1303
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:55,350
you know, um like x on a

1304
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:57,109
playstation

1305
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:59,670
Make them all the same right and then we don't have to worry about it

1306
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:03,050
Oh, yeah, I did say get congress involved

1307
02:04:08,439 --> 02:04:10,680
I distinctly remember what you're talking about

1308
02:04:13,510 --> 02:04:15,510
I like screamed that too

1309
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:18,090
That was was that during what what stream was that?

1310
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:21,510
Yeah, I was I was like fucking pissed

1311
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:27,130
I was really pissed off

1312
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:29,369
It was super monkey ball. Oh, yeah

1313
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:37,659
Whatever. Oh, there's new items

1314
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:48,500
You know, just somebody on like, um

1315
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:54,020
What is it like c what's that that government political kind of like congress channel

1316
02:04:54,899 --> 02:04:57,989
Somebody's up there with like a bunch of papers. I got this is I want to show you

1317
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:01,579
We need to standardize

1318
02:05:01,659 --> 02:05:04,699
C-span. Yeah, we need to stay. I have this is me. I'm putting for the bill

1319
02:05:05,479 --> 02:05:06,380
uh

1320
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:08,380
standardized game controller

1321
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:09,819
225

1322
02:05:09,819 --> 02:05:12,600
I'm getting real sick and tired of pressing b when I want to press a

1323
02:05:14,569 --> 02:05:17,449
My fellow friends on the other side of the aisle seem to not care about that

1324
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:20,489
They want to keep it. So when you press x

1325
02:05:21,779 --> 02:05:26,649
Might accidentally be pressing b

1326
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:32,699
They always do that and it's so fucking annoying

1327
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,579
I hate when they do that that okay

1328
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:38,619
So if it's a democrat talking about a republican or republican talking about a democrat, they always go

1329
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:41,180
See my friends on the other side of the aisle

1330
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:44,550
Stop stop that

1331
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:47,670
Uh, my friends over there. Oh, you see my friends over there

1332
02:05:48,310 --> 02:05:50,310

1333
02:05:50,470 --> 02:06:00,470
friend like come on

1334
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:02,149
politics, baby

1335
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:19,100
I can't laugh right now

1336
02:06:19,180 --> 02:06:21,180
My evil foes

Rare yeah, it's funny. I love depth of field, but I hate depth of field in video games

1398
02:12:37,399 --> 02:12:42,939
The first thing that I do I always just turn off every single

1399
02:12:43,739 --> 02:12:46,060
thing in the video settings

1400
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:49,579
Motion blur depth of field dramatic abrasion. They all go off

1401
02:12:52,579 --> 02:12:54,579

02:13:49,590 --> 02:13:52,710
You got you you're operating heavy machinery. I don't want to do that here

So cute

1430
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:24,170
Is that a greyhound?

1431
02:16:24,170 --> 02:16:45,620
Greyhounds are so cute. Oh, is it a corgi? How much is this?

1432
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:48,680
All right. I need two more dog bucks

1433
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:59,350

1435
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:06,299
I need to see auto. I can't just do it. None of these are auto

1436
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:11,559
It kind of looks it. No, it doesn't. I almost did it. You heard it. It was coming out

1437
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:14,940

Get a picture of a dog from the rooftop. Okay

02:18:01,850 --> 02:18:23,139
They're just kind of hanging out over there

1446

Expensive dinner

1447
02:18:33,129 --> 02:18:37,450
I need the zoom lens

1448
02:18:37,450 --> 02:18:55,030
The mountainous nature park is open now. Ooh

I woke up

1454
02:19:10,629 --> 02:19:12,389
maybe

1455
02:19:12,389 --> 02:19:14,709
Like maybe 40 minutes before the stream started

1456
02:19:15,610 --> 02:19:18,889
I didn't even know if I was gonna stream because I was like I feel like so terrible

1457
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:23,620
And then I took some talent on I was like, all right, let's go I was not trying to look good

1458
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:33,030
Why you think I look good today?

1459
02:19:40,629 --> 02:19:42,870
He's trying to make it seem like it's effortless

1460
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:49,979
Stop doing that

1461
02:19:51,659 --> 02:20:02,870
Pixel lens this looks like shit

02:20:08,569 --> 02:20:11,049
Pixel lens or is this a um

1463
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:30,500
Like a 160p stream photo of a biking. Oh a dog on a bike. It's kind of cool looking

1464
02:20:32,459 --> 02:20:35,370
All right dog on a bike

Found one. All right. Where's my money? Here it is

1466
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:48,120
All right. Let's try the other area

1467
02:20:48,120 --> 02:21:04,780
Rocket ship. How do I go to that one? Oh, it's the moon the actual moon

1468
02:21:05,579 --> 02:21:12,280
Oh, I beat the game

1469
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:14,280
Oh, I beat the game

1470
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:19,219
We went to the moon

1471
02:21:22,309 --> 02:21:25,350
Well, I I this other stuff to do

1472
02:21:26,069 --> 02:21:35,290
I played dark souls. No

1473
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:38,149
Today had to be a chill day

1474
02:21:38,229 --> 02:21:49,209
I'm not done. I want to fly. I want to do the other thing. Wait, it's not over

1475
02:21:49,690 --> 02:21:54,229
I think they were just saying like thanks for playing

1476
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:56,469
Oh, all right

1477
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:58,969
It's like an alien

1478
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:30,860
Three moon dogs in the earth. Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like? I want every dog on earth

1479
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:38,219
Okay, I wanted to take a picture of earth. Where's earth? Is that earth?

1480
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:49,000
The actual gravity that's funny a tiny flying saucer. You can take photos with mini ufo. Wait, what?

1481
02:22:59,030 --> 02:23:01,030
Oh, it's like a drone

1482
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:07,420
That's cool

1483
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:08,940
Picture of the dino

1484
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:29,209
I feel like if you posted this to dognet, you should get way more than four likes on this

1485
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:33,659
Like i'm on the moon, man. I'm on the moon

1486
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:40,549
Like bro, i'm on the moon

1487
02:23:40,549 --> 02:23:42,870
I think this deserves at least a thousand likes

1488
02:23:43,510 --> 02:23:58,180
This is actually a cool dogless pic. I'm more interested in close-up shots of dog outfits

1489
02:23:59,049 --> 02:24:01,030
Didn't like it

1490
02:24:01,030 --> 02:24:05,270
Okay

1491
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:11,430
Yes the sun

1492
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:13,989
Hey, you gave me a like that's all I care about even if you're wrong

1493
02:24:14,549 --> 02:24:16,549
You can be completely wrong. That's fine

1494
02:24:18,629 --> 02:24:20,389
All right. What do they have to say about this?

1495
02:24:20,389 --> 02:24:27,399
It's refreshing to see a no a no dog photo. I'm more interested in close-up of dogs outfits

1496
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:30,040
I can't believe you aren't more famous

1497
02:24:35,559 --> 02:24:43,850
zoom

1498
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:45,850
Though these are all my fans

1499
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:50,090
It's mostly art kids

1500
02:24:55,719 --> 02:24:58,040
We made extraterrestrial contact and they come in peace

1501
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:22,299
And an astronaut and an alien dog just hanging out. Okay, that's the flying saucer, right?

1502
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:36,889
Oh pixel lens shit

1503
02:25:36,889 --> 02:25:47,379
What that's a flying saucer, isn't it?

1504
02:25:47,379 --> 02:25:57,860
Can you show me what a real flying saucer looks like be sure to use the pixel lens

1505
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:35,239
That's a good photo of a flying saucer. Oh, wait turn around. That's like a satellite. What's that like a sled?

1506
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:58,680
All right, what's the flying saucer?

1507
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:14,090
All right. I need an alien and astronaut. This song is really good and they have to be happy

1508
02:27:14,729 --> 02:27:18,219
I mean, this is one right here

1509
02:27:18,219 --> 02:27:19,739
It's an alien dog, right?

1510
02:27:19,739 --> 02:27:25,930
That counts, right?

1511
02:27:25,930 --> 02:27:26,969
Do you hear that?

1512
02:27:26,969 --> 02:27:37,209
Did I have a gatorade sitting on my desk here and it just popped it went boom

1513
02:27:38,389 --> 02:27:45,100
I don't know. I have no idea why it was weird 200 followers. Nice

1514
02:27:47,879 --> 02:27:59,670
A challenge take a really good photo using film from the stylish pack. Okay, stylish pack was like

1515
02:28:00,229 --> 02:28:11,110
Arcade, right? Why not use the alien one bar out film pack. No stylist. There we go. How about mocha?

1516
02:28:13,340 --> 02:28:14,540
We'll do

1517
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:15,739
focus lens

1518
02:28:15,739 --> 02:28:25,379
Wait, actually

1519
02:28:25,379 --> 02:28:28,579
That kind of cool, right? That's pretty cool

1520
02:28:30,409 --> 02:28:32,709
How to focus on purpose

1521
02:28:32,709 --> 02:28:34,950
alien interesting staring

1522
02:28:36,010 --> 02:28:37,540
creepy

1523
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:45,430
funky

1524
02:28:45,430 --> 02:28:47,510
Three moon dogs in the earth. All right

1525
02:28:51,659 --> 02:28:59,770
They're gonna line this up

1526
02:28:59,770 --> 02:29:01,370
That's kind of cool looking

1527
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:10,329
You're doing something cool right now

1528
02:29:15,219 --> 02:29:17,219
Ah, it's like a shitty photo, but it's all right

1529
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:22,700
Three dogs in the frame and the earth

1530
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:42,950
That's actually not bad could have moved it a little bit to the left. I'm going to nice lock screen

1531
02:29:47,379 --> 02:29:49,059
Actually pretty good lock screen

1532
02:29:49,059 --> 02:30:22,360
Okay, why is there a gas station on the moon? See you later. That was radical. Nice job. That was a good trick

1533
02:30:24,709 --> 02:30:26,709
All right. Let me check out the other area

1534
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:47,530
Oh you unlock it daytime and nighttime and stuff. This is a cool area

1535
02:30:48,409 --> 02:30:50,969
It's beautiful scenery

1536
02:30:51,610 --> 02:30:59,739
I like that

1537
02:30:59,739 --> 02:31:16,819
Let's get a good one of these. You know what I mean? What do you think about this photo?

1538
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:25,479
How do you feel about this one?

1539
02:31:25,479 --> 02:31:26,920
Dog shit or good?

1540
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:37,850
Probably could have zoomed in a little more

1541
02:31:38,649 --> 02:31:43,829
All right. What do you want? What do you got objectives here?

1542
02:31:44,709 --> 02:31:48,870
Any dog and bird will do but the dog needs to look like it really loves being there

1543
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:54,329
Oh, there's birds. Okay a picture of bird

1544
02:31:54,969 --> 02:32:00,340
I feel like this is the right lens to use

1545
02:32:00,739 --> 02:32:19,159
Like the tf2 bird

1546
02:32:19,239 --> 02:32:34,180
I gotta go up there. I need a dog and a bird. Can you pet the birds?

1547
02:32:45,829 --> 02:33:06,059
Would you take the rule of thirds way too far? Okay. There's a bird. There's one over here

1548
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:19,139
I think that works. Oh a friendly dog with a bird. Hold on over here

1549
02:33:21,079 --> 02:33:35,239
Over here over here. I think that's perfect

1550
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:41,049
Actually, perfect. Yep

1551
02:33:41,049 --> 02:33:47,530
Okay, wouldn't it be cool to have a game of minecraft what pixelated dog in minecraft

1552
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:53,479
bird photographer simulator

1553
02:33:56,649 --> 02:33:59,850
What i'll play that soon

1554
02:34:00,729 --> 02:34:02,729
All right pixelated dog in a minecart

1555
02:34:03,879 --> 02:34:07,319
And then a fun challenge photo using film from the far out pack

1556
02:34:08,120 --> 02:34:12,979
And then a dog in a minecart

1557
02:34:12,979 --> 02:34:14,979
What is this cookie?

1558
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:30,459
Oh, here's the mine. Oh, it's not pixelized shit

1559
02:34:57,030 --> 02:34:59,020
dog shit

1560
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:02,790
No, it's not

1561
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:04,790
This photo is not dog shit

1562
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:11,930
Look at these you think these are bad. Look at these photos

1563
02:35:12,889 --> 02:35:23,610
Okay photo from the fire watch tower

1564
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:32,860
And then safety alert when you do something about them throw the scoot vac in the trash and send me proof

1565
02:35:36,010 --> 02:36:06,219
Okay, uh far out pack. Whoa. Okay. This one's cool. I like it

1566
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:13,350
All right. I gotta get a scoot vac put in the trash and then I have to take a picture of the fire watch tower

1567
02:36:17,459 --> 02:36:19,459
That one was actually bad. Yeah, it was

1568
02:36:25,659 --> 02:36:27,819
I told you I wanted to do the bird watching stream

1569
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:31,719
Where I actually just go and get a bunch of equipment

1570
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:36,040
And go to a place where we can really see some actual real birds

1571
02:36:37,479 --> 02:36:41,000
And set you guys up with a lens so you can see

1572
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:45,350
Venega, let's do the bird watching stream

1573
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:53,000
Go get lenses that like pro lenses

1574
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,520
That stream is either going to be really awful

1575
02:37:02,579 --> 02:37:10,420
What if we don't see any birds?

1576
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:17,399
What is all this?

1577
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:19,399
Oh, so this is i'm opening

1578
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:21,319
It up at night

1579
02:37:21,319 --> 02:37:29,940
What is this?

1580
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:31,540
stripe lens

1581
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:41,610
I kind of want to try the candy one. You should get an actor to show up in a bird costume. I think

1582
02:37:42,569 --> 02:37:45,930
That's probably that's probably what would happen

1583
02:37:47,829 --> 02:37:50,069
It's like somebody would just paint a huge bird outfit

1584
02:37:51,850 --> 02:37:55,370
Oh, no, fuck that. I got but don't tell anybody this because this is like gonna be funny

1585
02:37:56,409 --> 02:37:58,950
Uh, I shouldn't say this

1586
02:37:58,950 --> 02:38:00,950
Because I feel like it'd be really funny

1587
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:07,610
I'm not gonna say it because it's like the whole stream

1588
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:13,430
I'm not gonna say it. Nope, just i'm gonna keep it in the back pocket, but I want to do something on that stream

1589
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:16,950
That's gonna be really fucking stupid

1590
02:38:18,809 --> 02:38:22,329
Yeah, now I know why I can this is how I can do this stream

1591
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:29,270
And i'm i'm putting it down now. I'm going for it

1592
02:38:31,909 --> 02:38:35,030
We have made jokes about this stream for a long time

1593
02:38:36,229 --> 02:38:41,270
I'm gonna go for it now. I'm actually gonna go for it. It's not gonna happen for a while. I'm just telling you

1594
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:46,069
It's already like shit being planned the next like couple months

1595
02:38:46,229 --> 02:38:50,069
This is something that is gonna this is gonna have to be later like probably next year

1596
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:55,190
But I think that's fun to do

1597
02:38:56,149 --> 02:39:04,979
All right, I gotta go to the fire watch tower

1598
02:39:04,979 --> 02:39:06,739
Spring yeah spring would be perfect

1599
02:39:06,739 --> 02:39:21,750
What are these what are these little weirdos? What are these what are these little weirdos? What are these dogs like the big goofy dogs?

1600
02:39:24,940 --> 02:39:27,500
They're so cute. Where are they?

1601
02:39:27,559 --> 02:39:31,299
Pomeranians. Yeah

1602
02:39:31,299 --> 02:39:33,299
they're always they're always doing like

1603
02:39:33,620 --> 02:39:34,979
they're always like

1604
02:39:34,979 --> 02:39:50,059
You know what i'm saying? You know what I mean?

1605
02:39:50,059 --> 02:39:59,370
Good one. You now go to the cove at sunset for some dramatic magic hour lighting. Okay, I need to do the

1606
02:40:00,409 --> 02:40:16,069
Pomeranians are very sassy

1607
02:40:16,309 --> 02:40:21,110
How do you feel? Um, I'm not good, but not bad either. I'm fine

1608
02:40:22,329 --> 02:40:24,409
I don't think I'm gonna want to go for much longer though

1609
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:29,700
hot dog

1610
02:40:30,819 --> 02:40:32,819
A hot dog

1611
02:40:32,819 --> 02:40:34,819
Hot dog dog with a hot dog in his mouth

1612
02:40:54,940 --> 02:40:56,940
Yeah, this is actually really bad

1613
02:41:00,549 --> 02:41:02,549
Oh my god, I want that hat

1614
02:41:02,709 --> 02:41:05,850
There's no hat

1615
02:41:05,850 --> 02:41:09,219
This is a bot

1616
02:41:09,219 --> 02:41:13,059
I paid for bots on my account. I'm gonna get fucking thrown off this platform

1617
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:30,969
Are you in a hot dog costume too?

1618
02:41:31,780 --> 02:41:43,719
Wow, I need one more, uh dog buck because I want to get the

1619
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:46,360
Candy pack and see what it looks like

1620
02:41:49,219 --> 02:42:08,090
So what does it look like?

1621
02:42:08,090 --> 02:42:15,420
Bubble gum wait, I want a better view bubble gum. Oh, that's cool

1622
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:19,370
candy coated

1623

velvet

1626
02:42:24,680 --> 02:42:27,500
Let's do the bubble gum filter

1627
02:42:30,170 --> 02:42:32,170
That does feel like bubble gum

1628
02:42:42,340 --> 02:42:55,940
Now a lot is so what do you guys think about this photo? It's good. It is good. It's not dog shit

That was bait. Yeah, if you said it was dog shit, you had it wrong

Where's the trash? I have the same hat. Why do you look so sad?

1645
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:37,049
Um, I don't know where a trash is you think there'd be one right here

1646
02:45:47,299 --> 02:46:09,540
Bottom left. What do you that's not a direction. It's right here. Go left

1647
02:46:15,879 --> 02:46:18,360
This is just so cute. I need a picture of this. I don't want to disturb them

1648
02:46:19,000 --> 02:47:27,860
I'm out of focus. How do I focus it? I can't see any dog outfits. I'm your biggest fan

1649
02:47:31,350 --> 02:47:33,430
Uh, hello there my little feathered friend

1650
02:47:34,969 --> 02:47:37,610
This photo is blowing my mind

1651
02:47:45,450 --> 02:47:57,049
Why?

1652
02:47:57,049 --> 02:48:03,020
You already posted this today. What there's one person that wants the dog outfits

1653
02:48:05,399 --> 02:48:09,719
Hey, when are you gonna do a dog outfit? When are you gonna show the dog outfit? I want close-ups of dog outfits

1654
02:48:12,649 --> 02:48:16,809
Like the person that comes in here every day and says, uh, dude, when are you gonna when are you gonna play? Um,

1655
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:20,260
When when are you gonna play fucking scorn again?

02:48:20,979 --> 02:48:25,020
I'm just not gonna

02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:28,780
When are you gonna play skyrim? I'm waiting for skyrim. Is he playing skyrim today?

1658
02:48:37,879 --> 02:48:39,879
That's actually cool. All right

1659
02:48:40,120 --> 02:48:42,120
There's no trash. I can't do it

1660
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:50,780
I want to go back here to the to the sunset, right?

1661
02:48:51,659 --> 02:48:53,020
Oh

1662
02:48:53,020 --> 02:48:57,909
Let's do it then after this i'm probably gonna take it off

1663
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:01,059
I'm starting to

1664
02:49:01,059 --> 02:49:03,059
This side of my face is starting to hurt

1665
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:31,110
But I had fun i'm glad I could at least straighten a little bit hang out drink some tea

1666
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:36,500
Yeah, I will i'm gonna chill

1667
02:49:36,500 --> 02:49:38,500
And i'll just keep an eye on the sus

1668
02:49:39,049 --> 02:49:41,770
If for some reason I get worse, I I just will skip tomorrow

1669
02:49:42,819 --> 02:49:44,819
But I might be fine. I don't know. We'll see

1670
02:49:45,379 --> 02:50:13,479
Let me close up of her way

1671
02:50:13,559 --> 02:50:16,280
There's a spotted dog who hangs out at lighthouse cove after hours

1672
02:50:16,840 --> 02:50:18,840
You get a close-up photo of her face

1673
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:31,209
Look at that

1674
02:50:31,209 --> 02:50:33,209
Can't you just see text right here?

1675
02:50:34,709 --> 02:50:39,110
Being like sunset at the beach or something or whatever like town this is or whatever city this is

1676
02:50:40,329 --> 02:50:44,299
A bad composition. No, it is not

1677
02:50:44,379 --> 02:50:46,700
Like drifting away with the waves right there

1678
02:50:47,860 --> 02:50:49,860
They could sell these for six dollars each

1679
02:51:03,049 --> 02:51:05,049
All right. This is somebody have to take a photo of

1680
02:51:06,459 --> 02:51:08,379
Find the shy dalmatian

1681
02:51:08,379 --> 02:51:23,780
Over here, maybe I keep forgetting that i'm this weird

1682
02:51:24,899 --> 02:51:26,899
mascot character

1683
02:51:26,979 --> 02:51:32,760
I'm probably horrifying dalmatian. This is dalmatian

1684
02:51:39,940 --> 02:52:06,700
This looks so strange

1685
02:52:20,120 --> 02:52:43,700
Oh, I got it. Ow, my head got it dude. Look at this one

1686
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:53,750
Don't tell me this is not a good picture. Oh shit

1687
02:53:00,979 --> 02:53:04,379
Challenge no dogs

1688
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:22,170
Easy challenge complete. There's a dog that sleeps under a boat somewhere in the cove

1689
02:53:22,969 --> 02:53:25,770
Can you give me a picture of her? You have to go there at sunset. Okay

1690
02:53:26,569 --> 02:53:36,409
He's under a boat

1691
02:53:36,409 --> 02:53:45,799
Maybe right. Oh right here

1692
02:53:45,799 --> 02:53:50,780
Got it. There's one more here. There's uh, one of those hidden envelopes

1693
02:53:54,010 --> 02:54:02,459
On the roof maybe oh right here

1694
02:54:02,780 --> 02:54:11,989
Oh, we didn't have a chance to talk about it

1695
02:54:11,989 --> 02:54:16,149
But I was laughing so hard looking at the comments from uh, the tummy time stream

1696
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:20,540
People were like that deadpool was fucking one of the worst things i've ever seen

1697
02:54:21,260 --> 02:54:24,139
I was laughing my ass off man. Somebody was like dude. He just is he's

1698
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:27,440
Confusing michael angelo from the ninja turtles in deadpool

1699
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:32,379
I was like, oh actually kind of makes sense. I had a lot of fun

1700
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:35,739
I thought it was like a fun. I'll do it again and i'll fucking do it again

1701
02:54:36,979 --> 02:54:39,379
I'll do it again. I'll put that costume on and i'll do it again

1702
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:47,690
It's I like couldn't it's funny because like I couldn't see the chat really at all because i'm in like this costume

1703
02:54:47,770 --> 02:54:49,780
And i'm not like looking over there

1704
02:54:49,780 --> 02:54:52,920
And I was just having a time. I was just having fun pretending to be deadpool

1705
02:54:53,860 --> 02:54:55,860
I didn't care what anybody was even saying

1706
02:55:01,739 --> 02:55:03,739
People were begging you to stop

1707
02:55:04,360 --> 02:55:06,420
That's so funny though

1708
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:08,420
The fact that people felt like begging

1709
02:55:08,979 --> 02:55:13,700
Please stop

1710
02:55:13,780 --> 02:55:15,299
And I can't see them

1711
02:55:15,299 --> 02:55:21,959
I have no idea

1712
02:55:21,959 --> 02:55:24,920
Somebody said, uh, what was it? One of them was making me just roll

1713
02:55:26,469 --> 02:55:30,309
they were like charlie's expressions and charlie's demeanor was like

1714
02:55:31,270 --> 02:55:35,670
Talking to a kid that's dressed up for halloween. Just like oh, yeah. Nice job, sweetheart

1715
02:55:36,229 --> 02:55:38,309
Okay, cool. Show him your high kick

1716
02:55:41,530 --> 02:55:45,299
Like yeah, show me my high kick like a parent

1717
02:55:52,459 --> 02:55:56,459
It's like a parent that has this like kid that just just acting up and just like, okay

1718
02:55:58,219 --> 02:56:00,219
Nice job son

1719
02:56:03,049 --> 02:56:05,750
That was a lot of fun

1720
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:08,149
I said it before in the beginning of the stream, but those guys are all awesome

1721
02:56:10,059 --> 02:56:12,860
That whole group it was just like a joy to be around

1722
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:20,520
Okay, honey

1723
02:56:20,680 --> 02:56:22,680

1724
02:56:26,069 --> 02:56:28,790
Well, he had he had that unit on his arms

1725
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:31,670
That thing was electrocuting him

1726
02:56:31,909 --> 02:56:45,799
Please do la la I already did

1727
02:56:49,430 --> 02:56:51,430

What is that what happened?

1730
02:57:00,819 --> 02:57:07,299
That was crazy

1731
02:57:07,299 --> 02:57:11,739

Take an old timey photo. Okay, so I get a black and white photo

1735
02:57:32,329 --> 02:57:34,329
Show him your high kick

1736

I just did it. Oh

1737
02:57:44,840 --> 02:57:47,399
That's so much fun though. I'm glad people thought it was fun

1738
02:57:49,639 --> 02:58:09,850
All right, black and white the boardwalk is now open late. All right, cool. What is this new emo change scorn?

1739
02:58:10,649 --> 02:58:17,139

1746
02:58:37,239 --> 02:58:39,239
That looks cool. That actually looks really cool

1747
02:58:47,430 --> 02:58:49,430
Looks like an old video game

1748
02:58:49,430 --> 02:58:53,139
Like mist or something

1749
02:58:53,139 --> 02:58:54,420
All right

1750
02:58:54,420 --> 02:58:58,010
I think i'm gonna wrap it up here guys

1751
02:58:58,090 --> 02:58:59,290
um

1752
02:58:59,290 --> 02:59:03,450
Starting to to feel it and I want to make sure I don't stay here too long

1753
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:10,120
Hold on

1754
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:14,520
Uh, so tomorrow keep an eye on the sus. I know the whole schedule got thrown off because of this

1755
02:59:15,239 --> 02:59:19,159
Um, i'm gonna go chill. I'm gonna go take some more of this take it every four hours

1756
02:59:19,799 --> 02:59:23,159
Although I really don't like doing that. Anybody else get like that

1757
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:27,079
Like a cedaminophen especially be careful with it. This is not a joke

1758
02:59:27,799 --> 02:59:31,159
Um, if you take too much of cedaminophen and in one day it can actually fuck up your liver

1759
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:36,040
So every time it's like oh take this every four hours. It's like, hmm, maybe i'll do it every six

1760
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:43,909
But yeah, I think that's what's making me feel better. So we'll see

1761
02:59:44,629 --> 02:59:45,430
tomorrow

1762
02:59:45,430 --> 02:59:47,430
Uh keep an eye on the sus

1763
02:59:47,430 --> 02:59:49,110
I would say tba for now

1764
02:59:49,110 --> 02:59:51,590
But if I felt okay, then I was gonna just go today and I did

1765
02:59:52,469 --> 02:59:54,469
So the plan tomorrow

1766
02:59:54,469 --> 02:59:57,350
Is I want to play breath of the wild again

1767
02:59:58,309 --> 03:00:01,610
But I also want to do frog detective and um neon white

1768
03:00:02,780 --> 03:00:05,260
Then we got a lot of vr going on that next week

1769
03:00:06,540 --> 03:00:08,620
pretty much the entire next week

1770
03:00:09,959 --> 03:00:11,159
from

1771
03:00:11,159 --> 03:00:13,319
Like wednesday forward is all vr

1772
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:15,639
and of course

1773
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:17,799
culminating with the among us

1774
03:00:18,760 --> 03:00:20,760
sus rebranding of the entire channel

1775
03:00:22,579 --> 03:00:25,379
And I hope you understand i'm i'm selling the fuck out on that stream

1776
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:28,420
It's I it's gonna be a joke

1777
03:00:30,870 --> 03:00:38,860
But yeah, uh, we'll do a lot of vr

1778
03:00:39,739 --> 03:00:44,219
Hopefully this hopefully this is just something very small like a head cold or something. It just goes away

1779
03:00:44,940 --> 03:00:49,659
Obviously, i'll probably test tomorrow for covet again. And if it's negative then whatever I just have a cold or whatever

1780
03:00:50,700 --> 03:00:51,819
but

1781
03:00:51,819 --> 03:00:53,180
I'll see you guys

1782
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:55,450

1783
03:00:55,450 --> 03:00:57,450
short stream, I know but

1784
03:00:58,659 --> 03:01:02,420
I'll see you

1785
03:01:02,420 --> 03:01:04,579
Let's see what happens tomorrow. Keep an eye on sus

1786
03:01:05,139 --> 03:01:10,440
Do I have a sore throat? Yes, I do

1787
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:15,079
It's not that bad though. I can I can like i'm talking for three hours today

1788
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:19,700
See you soon regardless
