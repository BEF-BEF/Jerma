1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,800
Oh shit, people were betting on that. I didn't even see it. I didn't even know. I- I didn't even know. I had no idea.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,940
Two minutes late. Sorry, those of you that thought it was gonna happen a minute and a half ago.

3
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:29,690
You asshole. Look, you- I- I didn't- Look, I don't know you guys are betting on this stuff.

4
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,689
You guys can't bet on whether or not I'm gonna take a bath today.

5
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,689
And if I decide, unbeknownst to you guys betting, that I don't take a bath.

6
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,570
And half of you guys are watching like the Truman Show monitor going like, he didn't take a fucking bath today.

7
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:57,490
Fuck him. I'm just sitting- I'm- I don't know. You're looking- I know you have cameras in my house. What are you talking about?

8
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:07,829
Anyways. Hi guys. 3.3 million.

9
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:16,549
Wait, will Jerma be live in 24 minutes at exact- at 430 p- No. Oh, right, okay.

10
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:24,439
So today, we are going to do something that I've put off for a long time.

11
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,439
We're gonna play a game that I tried to stream like two years ago, three years ago.

12
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,439
And it wouldn't work and it was all messed up and I had a lot of trouble streaming it.

13
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:44,150
But we're back. That game is Spore. And you're probably wondering, why are you playing Spore, Jerma?

14
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,519
I thought you told me two days ago that you were gonna play Paper Mario, Thousand Year Door.

15
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:59,140
Well, you would be completely correct. I said, hey yeah, that sounds- let's do that next- let's do that next stream.

16
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,450
So, I, uh, I went through the process of looking into Thousand Year Door.

17
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:15,469
Didn't realize the game was incredibly rare. I thought it was gonna be as easy as just like going and getting it.

18
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:21,439
It's a rare ass game. And all of you saying, emulate it, emulate it.

19
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,439
You want me to openly emulate a first party Nintendo game and tell you I'm doing it on stream?

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,750
You're trying to get me fucking thrown in prison?

21
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:40,580
There's one thing that Nintendo hates more than anything. It's emulating.

22
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:48,580
Especially if somebody is actively there with like an audience of people going, yeah, I emulated this shit.

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:57,939
What do I care? A slip will go under my door. It'll have like a bunch of stamps on it.

24
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,199
It'll be from Nintendo themselves.

25
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:13,219
No, I ain't emulating a first party Nintendo game. I'll find a way to stream it legally.

26
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:19,219
Uh-uh. I ain't fucking with that. I ain't fucking with Nintendo. They're ruthless if they find out.

27
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:32,939
Pepehands, he lied to us.

28
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,939
So, I said, you know what? Why don't we play a game that a lot of people have wanted to see for a long time?

29
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:44,439
We're gonna play Spore. And we'll probably do Spore for the next- I don't know, depending how good it is.

30
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,810
I forget nostalgia is kicking in. I remember it being kind of fun.

31
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,430
But maybe we'll do this for the next couple of days. We'll see.

32
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Just buy it on Amazon? Well, yeah, but buying it on Amazon is easy.

33
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:11,810
The problem is that a lot of the shipping dates are not till February.

34
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,629
What about the flashing? Yes, okay, I think I have fixed the flashing.

35
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,629
That's since two days.

36
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,629
I didn't say February 1st. I said February. That does not- okay.

37
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,629
Some of you guys are way too literal with all information.

38
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,629
If I say the word February, that doesn't mean February 1st at 1201 AM.

39
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:43,329
That's not what that means. It could mean, like, February 8th, February 15th, February 6th, February 20th.

40
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:46,459
And some of them are expensive.

41
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:56,410
And I will pay $250 for Gotcha Force, but I will not pay $250 to make sure I get a thousand-year door here.

42
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:11,439
Like, in four days. No. Cheap-ass motherfucker.

43
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,439
I'm not even a cheap-ass motherfucker.

44
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:22,629
Chat is deranged.

45
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,629
I knew this was going to happen when I looked it up and I was like, oh shit, this is, like, kind of a rare game.

46
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,629
I've got to figure out how to do this.

47
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm going to get it. I'm going to get- look, I might even do- I might even get one of the ones that gets here early.

48
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,920
But nothing's ever guaranteed to get here early.

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:50,040
Somebody- no, I'm not even going to read that.

50
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,730
Maybe you shouldn't plan things only one day in advance.

51
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,310
That's how I operate. That's how I operate, man.

52
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,769
This is something that a lot of the new viewers probably don't understand.

53
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:10,939
So there are, like, huge projects that are, like, months if not years in the making that you will see on this channel.

54
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:17,379
Everything else is planned 12 hours before a stream turns on.

55
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:25,870
That's just the way it is. That's just how it is here.

56
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,819
And sometimes it's, like, 30 minutes before a stream turns on.

57
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:40,410
I go, hmm, fucking what's happening today? Um, leaf blower simulator?

58
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:47,829
That sounds like fun.

59
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,829
And then you ask chat. Yeah, I'm like, chat, what do you think?

60
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:57,209
What about Pikmin? You know what?

61
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,209
Because- okay, listen to me.

62
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:07,209
Because Paper Mario and the thousand-year-old door has been postponed until somewhere in the middle of February,

63
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:14,209
I'm going to use my IOU card here and we're going to play Pikmin.

64
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:17,769
I'll give you a date when I figure that out.

65
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:21,769
Because I don't want to say, we're going to play Pikmin 2 in four days.

66
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:25,769
And I, like, go on Amazon, it's going to take six days to get her, even with, like, Prime or something.

67
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,769
I can't- I'm not doing that.

68
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,769
I'm going to play Pik- which one should I play?

69
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:39,899
It's Pikmin 2, right? Should I just do them all?

70
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,899
If I play Pikmin 1, people that love Pikmin 2 are going to be pissed that I played Pikmin 1.

71
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,899
If I play Pikmin 2 first, people are going to be mad that I skipped Pikmin 1.

72
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,899
They're going to be, that's the best one, go play- and if I play Pikmin 3, all of you are going to be mad.

73
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,899
Because that's universally the hated one.

74
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,610
Nobody likes Pikmin 1.

75
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,100
3 is good. Uh oh.

76
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,269
Did I just do it? Did I start the war?

77
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:12,089
I'll do a poll. Alright, we're going to do a poll at the end of this chat as to which Pikmin I'm going to play.

78
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,709
By the way, I- hold on.

79
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:28,600
I think I, uh, I think I already have one.

80
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:38,019
Was I able to buy it twice? I forgot I owned it.

81
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:53,190
Which one do I have?

82
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,590
I want it.

83
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:06,039
What's the one that's on Wii?

84
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,500
I have it somewhere. What's the one that's on Wii?

85
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:17,049
One or two.

86
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,049
One and two are on Wii. Huh.

87
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,610
Both are on Wii. Okay.

88
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,610
Let me see if I can find it. I actually think I really do own it.

89
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,769
Alright. Let's go. We're going to play Spore.

90
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,769
I don't have- I forget everything. I fucking have no idea how to play this game.

91
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:38,379
Find it.

92
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,100
You have to find it already.

93
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Spore. Alright, so for all you Spore-andies.

94
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,720
Should I?

95
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,299
Should I just play the- start a new game?

96
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:54,610
Or should we make a creature?

97
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,909
What do you think?

98
00:09:55,909 --> 00:10:04,950
Should I just go with the DNA builder thing, or should I make a creature?

99
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,129
I feel like if I make a creature right now, I'm gonna end up sitting here for the next, like, six hours.

100
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:18,039
Just new game, just new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game, new game.

101
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,039
Okay. Alright, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

102
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,039
Make a creature, you dickhead.

103
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,039
I'm not gonna.

104
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:30,529
New game, please. New game, please.

105
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,950
Do I do a poll?

106
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,450
Alright, I'll do a poll.

107
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,450
Just new game or make creatures?

108
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:47,409
Oh, you're gonna- I have to desktop capture this.

109
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:56,610
I'm not supposed to see this shit. Hold on.

110
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,610
That's just the background.

111
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,610
Every single one of your parents' computers, that's the background that's there.

112
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,980
I just gave a bunch of you guys, like, weird flashbacks of going to, like, your grandmother's house.

113
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,620
You want the truth? I gave you the truth.

114
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,620
The reason why I don't have a three- a cool background is because I have three monitors.

115
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,620
And I have no idea how to make it go across all three of them.

116
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
And every time I do it, it, like, stretches them and pixelates it and looks like shit.

117
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Even if it's at the right resolution, I haven't figured out how to do it yet.

118
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,620
And I got three monitors, like, two or three years ago.

119
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,740
So I just don't even care anymore.

120
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
There was a picture of Carnage up at one point.

121
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,879
And then I think, um, I think, like, the Pac-Man ghosts.

122
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,879
And that was it.

123
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,820
Google it. I tried to Google it. It didn't help me.

124
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,059
Alright, what are we doing? What am I doing?

125
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh, straw poll.

126
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Alright, do you want me to start a new game and just play or do you want me to make a creature specifically?

127
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,409
Make a creature or start a new game?

128
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:08,000
This is important, guys. Come on.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,899
This is impor- what's the difference?

130
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,899
Um, I don't know. I have no idea.

131
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,899
There's a difference. I know there is.

132
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,460
When you start a new game, you, like, have to build, like, a creature from scratch or something, right?

133
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
By eating food.

134
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,659
But making a creature, you just get to make everything you want and build one and use it later.

135
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:30,529
What the hell are you writing?

136
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,919
Make him see this. Make him see this.

137
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,919
Jeremy, you gotta make a couple creatures first. They can be shitty or cool or whatever you like.

138
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:40,919
When you do that and then start a game, you will see those creatures inside the game you're playing.

139
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,919
They're just the dumbass default Maxis-created creatures, so please make some creatures first.

140
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,860
Okay.

141
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,980
All right, all right, all right, all right.

142
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,629
All right, so we're gonna make a bunch of random- this is gonna take forever.

143
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:57,629
Whatever. Welcome to the stream.

144
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:04,340
All right. All right, here we go.

145
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm gonna do that and then I'm not gonna make a creature for myself, though.

146
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,269
That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

147
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:23,679
I have a bunch of cool creatures made if you want to add me as a spore buddy.

148
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,679
I couldn't make an account.

149
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,679
I tried to, like, five times. There's an error. Like, there's a server problem.

150
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,240
All right, so should I do a foal creature or should I do little baby creatures?

151
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,129
Do foal creatures, right?

152
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:42,399
All right, here we go.

153
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:50,059
Mmm. New game, idiot.

154
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,059
No, I'm gonna make a couple of creatures!

155
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:55,820
All right, so this is my- where's the body? This is the body, right?

156
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:04,389
Let's go with, um, I want a standing creature.

157
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,779
I like- I kind of remember how to play.

158
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,500
Okay, you have to let- you can shrink the body and everything? Okay.

159
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,700
Remember, you don't even know how the animals work.

160
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,149
I have- I don't- I have no idea how to play the game.

161
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,149
I just remember- I remember- okay.

162
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,149
Here's what I remember about Spore.

163
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,470
I played Spore, like, 12 years ago. 15 years ago.

164
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,779
And I think I did this for, like, an hour.

165
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,460
Ran around and danced during the creature stage or something.

166
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,460
And then I- that's all I remember. I don't know anything else.

167
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:44,700
Let's pull that spine back a little bit.

168
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
That's what you do. That's all you do. Yeah, I know.

169
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,779
That is all you do in this game.

170
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,779
Uh, I think his head's- he needs to be-

171
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:52,779
There we go, like that.

172
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,539
Pull these back a little.

173
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,539
I'm gonna give him, like, a big- like a nice, like, Chad posture.

174
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:03,720
Align that spine perfectly.

175
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
There we go. Yep.

176
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,350
There it is. Perfect fucking spine alignment.

177
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,350
Does he got a gamer neck? No, he doesn't.

178
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,539
Why is this- how is this a gamer neck?

179
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:23,789
I guess I don't know what it kind of is.

180
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,789
Is he supposed to be, like, a cha- no.

181
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,159
Alright, this is looking a little-

182
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,149
This is looking a little-

183
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,149
I want- I do want to, like, a little bit of a gamer neck.

184
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:41,620
There we go.

185
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,769
Jesus. Okay. That's not bad.

186
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:57,029
Do we even- beak?

187
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:08,039
I don't know if I like the beak.

188
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,039
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

189
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,039
It's a bird. No, but I don't want a bird.

190
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,860
Delete. How do I delete?

191
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,620
I kind of like this. No, no, no. A duck?

192
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh, by the way, I- I- Can somebody that plays this game all the time-

193
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
I have the new parts, right?

194
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,500
Because I bought the whole package.

195
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,570
I do? No.

196
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,029
What do you mean, no? It's not?

197
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,029
No, no, no, you don't appear to have them.

198
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:50,200
What? I installed everything. Really?

199
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,879
I don't have all the extra parts?

200
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,309
You do, you do, you do, you do.

201
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,490
I didn't get scammed. Okay.

202
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,490
He does, you do. Alright, so they're lying to me, alright.

203
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:13,029
What about this one?

204
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:16,230
Right down here? Two mouths?

205
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,559
I kind of like that.

206
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,000
That's doing it for me.

207
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,170
Give him a tiny face.

208
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:40,359
A huge underbite?

209
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,539
Got a mask on. Alright, I like that.

210
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:47,660
I like this one too. But that's alright, we can make more than one.

211
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,430
How do I, um, zoom in?

212
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,019
It's not mouse scroll.

213
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:02,099
How do I zoom in with the mouse?

214
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:04,730
Okay, that looks good. Eyes. How about, um-

215
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,269
These are eyes? These are pig eyes.

216
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:14,180
These are pig nose. These are ears.

217
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:22,299
Okay, how about, um- I like that.

218
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:25,049
I like that even better though.

219
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:34,069
Yep. I like this.

220
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:45,579
Holy shit, he's evil. Did he be evil? Toad.

221
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:50,059
I kind of like it with the eyes

222
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,059
down, like this.

223
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,640
I'm very upset.

224
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,720
Or, I don't know, how about-

225
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,920
This is just what your dog does when you have french fries.

226
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,440
It just sits like this, as a statue.

227
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,670
Um, alright, should I do

228
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,670
kind of evil? I'm sure I'll do

229
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:23,210
french fry dog. I like that.

230
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,640
Alright, now we need- Do I like this body?

231
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:33,059
I think the body could be better.

232
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:39,079
Just give him a huge belly. This is just a guy

233
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:45,910
running around in an alien suit.

234
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,619
Okay, let me see. Arms and legs.

235
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,380
Wait, what's this thing? Ears? No, no ears.

236
00:19:52,380 --> 00:20:01,180
Zero ears. Pregnant.

237
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Should we give him- Should he even have arms?

238
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:12,630
Maybe he should even have arms.

239
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:20,059
Grasshopper legs? I want the big stomach.

240
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:42,119
Okay, that's not bad. He's sitting

241
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,119
on his own- He's sitting on his own

242
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:48,019
legs. Jesus Christ, what?

243
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:57,799
It's a flamingo? Isn't that backwards?

244
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:10,150
Yeah, these are too big. Alright, there we go.

245
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,420
That means it has extra jumping

246
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:25,180
ability, right?

247
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,890
Try walking. Oh, how do you do that?

248
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:43,000
Test drive. How do I make him walk?

249
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,819
His neck. Oh, look, it hurts.

250
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:54,009
He's going like- Ow! What else is this?

251
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:57,900
Okay, spin. He can spin?

252
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:06,519
Roar. Alright, how about a flip? Nice.

253
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,660
How about a- Where's the dance?

254
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,650
It goes-

255
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,049
Scared. Sad.

256
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:22,470
Where's- Where's dance?

257
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:31,220
Ball, sit, punch. Here we go.

258
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:39,720
Here it is. Oh, I love it.

259
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,819
Toe tap. That's my favorite one

260
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:49,900
when they shake their head around. Okay, I like it.

261
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,529
I'm gonna keep going. Okay, we have feet.

262
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:58,470
Weapons. Oh, shit, hold on.

263
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:13,000
He has like a saw blade on his stomach?

264
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,119
I'm just making a battle bot. Silent hill

265
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,539
monster. Give him- Okay, wait, that's true.

266
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,799
That is kind of- What if they're on his, like,

267
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,640
arms? What about the little T-Rex saw

268
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,630
blade? Oh, I kinda like that.

269
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,819
These are his hands. No, no, no, no, no.

270
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:48,569
Mantis? I kinda like this. I'm gonna

271
00:23:48,569 --> 00:24:00,920
flip him around, though, because these are his arms.

272
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:12,619
No, I don't like that either.

273
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,460
This isn't even my creature. Why do I even care?

274
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,490
Details. Gems?

275
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,569
I put gems all over him? Wait, what is this?

276
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:35,319
I can give him a little propeller?

277
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:37,319
Oh, I love it. I love it, I love it, I love it. Hold on.

278
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:53,369
Definitely keeping that on. What about

279
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,369
some little, like, fluffies on his

280
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:59,000
shoulders? On his knees? Okay.

281
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,910
This is what every German 985

282
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,910
fan looks like. God damn it, I clicked out

283
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:17,049
of the chat box. This is what every

284
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,049
German 985 fan looks like. Alright, what we got?

285
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:22,759
We have singing. He's very good at

286
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,539
singing. Okay, he's got a good mating

287
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:29,799
call. He's got very good eyesight.

288
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,799
He's kind of- Not that fast.

289
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,750
He's got 40 health, okay. Now, hold on.

290
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,150
Uh, should he have

291
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,150
arms or not? No, definitely not.

292
00:25:44,150 --> 00:26:02,779
Give him some more legs. Maybe I'll give him some more legs.

293
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:11,740
Hold on. Is his head too heavy, though?

294
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:23,130
His head might be too heavy. He's doing the

295
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:34,140
Kubrick stare. I like him. Alright,

296
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,950
good. Let's, um,

297
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:44,359
change the color? Yeah.

298
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:52,279
Alright, paint mode. What are you thinking?

299
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,930
Uh, let's see. Marine?

300
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:02,460
Flesh, flesh, flesh, flesh colored.

301
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,490
I kinda like the, like,

302
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,420
cantaloupe. I

303
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,569
really like the cantaloupe. It's perfect.

304
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:22,339
Partial styles? Oh, you can do partial,

305
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,859
right? Give him more legs. Alright, hold on.

306
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:31,559
He's got jumping legs, and

307
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,890
how about- What about these weird ones

308
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:48,069
in the front? Ooh, wait a minute.

309
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:57,480
No, that looks ugly. You're gonna

310
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:05,720
ruin him. I'm just- I'm just looking.

311
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,740
Just one leg in the front. You made

312
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
a creeper. I did?

313
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,950
I kinda did. Can he just

314
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:28,890
do one single leg? It's a creeper.

315
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,509
Even the

316
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:37,019
flower on his head. Alright, I don't-

317
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,019
I'll have to make a few more, so we're gonna

318
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:42,980
leave him alone. Doesn't the creeper

319
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,990
have, like, a flower? Who has a flower

320
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,019
on their head? That's a fake fan.

321
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,019
What enemy has a flower on their head?

322
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:57,269
Oh, it's a Pikmin. It's a Pikmin. We just talked about

323
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,089
Pikmin. Okay, that's what it is. Yeah,

324
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:07,700
it's a Pikmin. Thank you. I kinda like the

325
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,480
bear claws. Wait, what?

326
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:20,309
Oh, shit. No, no, no. Should I give him, like, the bird feet?

327
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:28,940
Bear claws or bird feet? Which one?

328
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:37,380
Bird feet. Definitely. What's he doing?

329
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:50,700
He did that with his feet, by the way.

330
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,630
No arms. I like it.

331
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,259
It's perfect. Those are hands. They are?

332
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:05,660
Those are arms?

333
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:12,869
I thought those were legs.

334
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:14,869
Okay, we're gonna- Alright, that's enough.

335
00:30:14,869 --> 00:30:21,130
Name creature. Creature's name is gonna be...

336
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,380
It has to be some type of cantaloupe.

337
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:33,529
I mean, no. No, no, no, no.

338
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:40,680
Cantafloat.

339
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,819
Give him feet. Why does he need feet?

340
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:53,849
Go feet. The creepalope.

341
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,849
That's awful. I actually kinda like it, though.

342
00:30:55,849 --> 00:31:26,759
The creepalope. There we go.

343
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:39,029
Tags. Who cares?

344
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,660
I don't know how to say yes. Alright, there he is. The creepalope.

345
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,200
Hold A when placing a part for

346
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,700
symmetry mode. Okay. He unironically

347
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,319
needs feet, though. Does he?

348
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,880
Unironically?

349
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Unironically?

350
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:10,700
Am I buying these now?

351
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,789
Should we webbed feet?

352
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:21,000
These bird feet. Unironically, yes.

353
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,200
Alright, fine.

354
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,700
He's looking good. I think he's good to go.

355
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,009
How do we say yes? Save and exit.

356
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,309
I need to make another one, right?

357
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:40,549
So save this one and exit, and then do it again.

358
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:48,809
I need to make a few, right? This next one's gonna be

359
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:59,049
a hellish creation, by the way.

360
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:02,440
I wanna make a big snake. Let's see.

361
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,200
What do I wanna do? I think I'm just gonna make a snake.

362
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:17,339
Snakes don't have feet.

363
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,339
Let's pull this back a little more.

364
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm gonna make a scorpion.

365
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:46,410
Definitely make it a scorpion.

366
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:49,859
I want a big, dangerous tail.

367
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:53,579
Make this head smaller.

368
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:56,259
Looks pretty good. Mouth. What kind of mouth does a scorpion have?

369
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:01,559
Not that.

370
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,559
It's just a replace holder.

371
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:14,309
It's kinda like this gross thing, isn't it?

372
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:21,539
I kinda like it. Won't he stab himself in the head at all?

373
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:35,670
It's perfect.

374
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:42,380
That's perfect already.

375
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,050
Now, eyes.

376
00:34:47,050 --> 00:35:04,059
Not bad.

377
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:09,239
I love him. Okay.

378
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:19,099
What about a pig nose?

379
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,489
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

380
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:27,099
I think without a nose, it's perfect.

381
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,099
Oh, should we give him one of these?

382
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,099
Oh, I love him. Can this be mine?

383
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:44,650
Can this be my guy?

384
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,130
Yeah, no nose. Just do nose holes.

385
00:35:49,130 --> 00:36:03,000
How do I do a nose hole? It's fucking angry.

386
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,420
It's not angry.

387
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:18,409
I like the little ears, too.

388
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:26,070
Oh my god. What?

389
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,070
Okay, that looks alright.

390
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,719
The ears might be too much, but I really like them.

391
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:36,309
No, not yet.

392
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:39,449
He's gotta be lower to the ground. There.

393
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:45,059
We're gonna give him like a bunch of centipede arms.

394
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,369
What do you think? Centipede legs.

395
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:50,309
That's what a scorpion has, right?

396
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,809
Eye bones, bug leg. There it is.

397
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:55,750
Armored bones.

398
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:05,079
Look at that. Bug legs.

399
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:08,019
These are huge. These are way too big.

400
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,579
They're gigantic.

401
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:13,269
In order to get the other parts in the mod,

402
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:15,269
you have to launch Spore creepy and cute

403
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:17,269
instead of the base game. Please copy this so he sees.

404
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:27,369
Really?

405
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,809
Is that gonna fuck everything up?

406
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:39,449
He already has them. You already have them.

407
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:51,610
No, he doesn't. I don't know who to believe.

408
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,510
Alright, shrink these legs. Sorry, guys.

409
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:10,420
Destroyed on heal. He's ignoring us.

410
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420
No, he has extra parts from an update.

411
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,119
Not the expansion. Really?

412
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:18,119
Okay, if I save this, can I go back and edit this guy later?

413
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:22,329
Remember, you have them.

414
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:25,139
Top left. Exoskeleton. Core Spore.

415
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:31,780
He doesn't have them.

416
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,219
Doesn't fucking have them. Stop lying.

417
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:37,159
There's mouths and eyes. That's not them.

418
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,909
That's not it. Chat. Wrong.

419
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:42,980
Not the DLC. What?

420
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,610
Okay, so I'm just gonna save this right here.

421
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,610
I'm gonna name this guy like fucking Bill.

422
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,679
And then I'm gonna save and exit.

423
00:38:50,679 --> 00:39:03,400
Is that gonna work?

424
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Launch Galactic Adventures if you have it to get both DLCs.

425
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
If not, then... Okay.

426
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,050
So we'll have to launch Galactic Adventures?

427
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,050
Why do they make it like this? This is fucking weird.

428
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,679
Yes, yes. Okay.

429
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,679
But what about my settings?

430
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,679
What about my, like, INI config files shit that I changed?

431
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:25,300
Do I have to...

432
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,820
Is there one EXE? Is there one EXE?

433
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:38,170
Who knows? There's three EXEs?

434
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,880
Hold on.

435
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,820
Let me just make sure this is not gonna fuck around.

436
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,059
I might have to change a few things.

437
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:51,210
That's weird. Bro, just open the game.

438
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:54,980
Open Galactic Adventure. Hold on.

439
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,739
Let me just make sure...

440
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:00,550
Take a look at some artwork for a little bit.

441
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,750
Take a look at some artwork for a little bit. I gotta figure this out.

442
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:08,869
Bro, it's just bugs next.

443
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:14,949
Look what I got.

444
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:18,659
Catboys!

445
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:22,630
Okay, let me open this.

446
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,599
They tell me there's three EXEs.

447
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,599
Let's check on that.

448
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,340
Let's see what the heck is going on here.

449
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:39,019
I don't think there is three EXEs.

450
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,019
Spore. Spore bin. Spore bin F1.

451
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:45,030
Spore app.

452
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,530
God, what the...

453
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,239
I don't know what the hell is going on.

454
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,239
Spore bin F1.

455
00:40:53,239 --> 00:41:03,030
Spore app. Is that the one that I need to open?

456
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,449
No. It's the orange one. Yeah, that is that one.

457
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:09,449
Alright, I think I'll be alright.

458
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:15,849
Let me do this really quickly.

459
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,539
Galactic Adventure is from Steam.

460
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:22,360
Yeah, but I have to add some...

461
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Resolution thing that I have in the other one. Hold on.

462
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,309
It runs at 1920x1080.

463
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:33,900
I gotta make sure it does that.

464
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
So Galactic Adventure will have all of them.

465
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,099
Is what you're telling me.

466
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:48,679
It might be really loud. I hope it's not loud. I'm gonna turn it off.

467
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:55,639
Okay.

468
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:59,079
Here we are. In the game.

469
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,079
That was incredibly loud. I'm so glad I

470
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,079
just saved all of you.

471
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:05,079
You can hear it through my headphones.

472
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:13,769
This shit is unbelievably loud.

473
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,889
Okay, let's try this again.

474
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,889
So, re-8. I gotta go back.

475
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:23,750
It runs real quick.

476
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,989
Alright, this is good to go.

477
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:28,659
This is good to go.

478
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,349
Okay, are we ready?

479
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,829
If I go to create, where do I go?

480
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:43,940
Where's my creatures?

481
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,300
Creature creator, you go to edit.

482
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,949
Okay.

483
00:42:54,949 --> 00:42:58,980
What do you think?

484
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:08,179
Hold on, not yet. Hey, look at that.

485
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:10,179
There we go. I have the parts now.

486
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:13,690
Is this all of them?

487
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,739
Is this all of them?

488
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:22,070
Wow, I guess chat.

489
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,340
New creation.

490
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,409
How do I get my old one?

491
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,409
New creation, save.

492
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:35,849
You must save before sharing.

493
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:41,079
Where's the top left?

494
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,079
What do you mean top left?

495
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,079
Creepy and cute. There it is. Okay, cool.

496
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:47,960
Button and bottom left.

497
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,380
Sporpedia, bottom left, lower left.

498
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,920
Top left, bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.

499
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,349
What are you talking about? I don't see it.

500
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:03,480
Upper right. Sporpedia.

501
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,449
Ohhhh!

502
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:15,059
Alright, we're good. We're in.

503
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:21,780
I kinda actually really like the ears.

504
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,219
This is ugly. Well, whatever.

505
00:44:24,219 --> 00:44:26,389
Alright, how do you duplicate? It's alt and what?

506
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:34,820
That's the hit sound.

507
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,820
Duplicate is what? F4? Just alt.

508
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:43,019
Copy, there it is. Oops.

509
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:53,110
How many legs does a scorpion have?

510
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,110
It's like eight. Or six?

511
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,889
I have no idea. I think it's six.

512
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:00,889
And the back legs are a little higher, right?

513
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,829
Because they're just fucking terrifying little monsters.

514
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:07,849
Okay.

515
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:09,849
That looks alright. Now we need

516
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:11,849
weapons. There we go.

517
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:16,630
There we go.

518
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:23,929
This is fucking dangerous.

519
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,929
That's too big. He'll kill himself with this.

520
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,230
What's the survival rate on these guys?

521
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,110
What if it's a limp?

522
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:36,230
Oh, I kinda like the big tooth thickness.

523
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:43,659
There's no sound?

524
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:47,559
Oh, shit. Sorry.

525
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:49,559
This is his tail.

526
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,889
Okay.

527
00:45:52,889 --> 00:46:01,059
Details.

528
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,500
No wings or anything, right?

529
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Wait, don't scorpions have arms in the front

530
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,960
that come out like big claws?

531
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:16,940
Dude, don't they? Get rid of these.

532
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,940
They're big lobster claws that come out

533
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,460
in the front. Okay, let's do big lobster claws.

534
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:31,909
What do we got?

535
00:46:31,909 --> 00:46:33,909
They have six legs and two arms. They have six

536
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:40,820
legs, do they? How the fuck is that animal

537
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,820
real? You ever think about that?

538
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,820
How is that a real thing on planet

539
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,829
Earth? What a bizarre fucking

540
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:52,630
creation. Think about all these

541
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:54,630
animals and all these bugs and shit that just

542
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,630
look at how weird these things are. Look at how

543
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,690
ridiculous our Earth is. Bugs

544
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,690
are fucking weird. They really are. I

545
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,230
don't even know how to explain them. We already went over ants.

546
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,539
Ants are just a math problem.

547
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,900
They just follow code.

548
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,900
Bugs are just living math

549
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:24,309
problems. It's bizarre.

550
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,309
Bugs are math. We already did this. We already went

551
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:28,940
over how bugs are math. Bugs

552
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,940
are just a math problem. Like, we already went over this.

553
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,940
It's an algorithm that just plays out as like a

554
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,940
creature. Don't make me go over this again. A lot

555
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,940
of you weren't here a few years ago. I'll do it again.

556
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:50,019
Okay, hold on. What about sting?

557
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:54,550
Where's sting?

558
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,550
How do I use the weapon? Bite and charge?

559
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:02,809
He's just using his head. Why is he

560
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:05,880
leaning down like that? He needs

561
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:17,400
two more tiny front legs?

562
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,579
Does he? Two more tiny front legs?

563
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:46,059
Like that? No, it looks like he's

564
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:50,340
wearing a tie. Where's bug

565
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,800
hands? Arm plated,

566
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,059
brawned, humerus, tendinitis,

567
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:03,059
tubular, fleshed?

568
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,400
Like bones? I like these.

569
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,139
Jesus. Those are way

570
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:21,340
too big. Way too big.

571
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,980
Just absolutely enormous. And they go out

572
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,929
like that, right? Yep. Pull these elbows in.

573
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:33,610
This is way too huge.

574
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:36,869
Oh, he's fucking terrifying.

575
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:43,400
That. There we go. Well, actually, some scorpions

576
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
have big arms, like huge

577
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
hands and arms and stuff, like the emperor scorpion.

578
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,860
I'm a viewer of Clint's Reptiles.

579
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,860
Okay, I know what I'm talking about. And he gave it

580
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,030
like a three out of, a two out of five.

581
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:02,329
You don't want, scorpions are hard to have. Okay.

582
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:11,210
We need like lobster claws.

583
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:23,539
I mean, that's the closest thing I'm going to get.

584
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:26,230
Do they have mittens? Do they give them big mittens?

585
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:32,179
Give poison to the

586
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:38,579
stinger.

587
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:49,900
They're like big boxing gloves.

588
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,170
All right. I like it. It's perfect.

589
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,170
He's got these funny ears. He's so cute.

590
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,670
I love him. He looks like a baby.

591
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:07,989
Looks like Bernie. It does not

592
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:10,300
look like Bernie Sanders.

593
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:16,699
Okay. I don't even know where you're seeing

594
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:25,400
that from. The mittens. Oh, oh.

595
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,829
I was like, how is this Bernie?

596
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:29,829
Everything is Bernie. Or hold on. Let me do test drive.

597
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:35,079
I love it so far. All right. Let's do, first

598
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:37,079
of all, we got to do the point dance because that's

599
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,630
the most important one. Oh, yeah.

600
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:53,179
This might be the best one.

601
00:51:53,179 --> 00:52:01,289
How about Raver? That's a good one, too.

602
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:10,440
I think we need to change the stomach a little.

603
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:17,909
I'm happy. I need a laugh, too.

604
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:21,940
He's like a donkey.

605
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:35,130
I love it. That's fantastic.

606
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,030
Okay. So if he's a scorpion,

607
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:44,409
scorpions are usually like a beige

608
00:52:44,409 --> 00:52:46,840
color or sometimes a bright orange

609
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,840
and the bright orange ones are the fucking evil ones.

610
00:52:48,840 --> 00:53:04,380
Yeah, the orange, the little

611
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,380
orange ones are the evil ones.

612
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:15,829
Ooh, that looks kind of cool.

613
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:19,349
The weird kind of like crusty hands.

614
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:28,309
He has like deep fried hands.

615
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:40,380
Hmm. I like it.

616
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:46,699
Could go red. Ooh.

617
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:54,250
That's cool looking, too. I like that.

618
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:59,539
That's my favorite so far. I could do patterns

619
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:04,599
too, couldn't I? Ooh.

620
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,599
I have to pick a clown.

621
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:15,269
Not this guy. All right. He's good.

622
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:17,269
I got to check. The body is going to be a little different.

623
00:54:17,269 --> 00:54:20,019
Let me see. I don't want to ruin this. But don't you feel like

624
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:28,280
the body needs to be a little thicker right here? Just by a little?

625
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:38,260
He's down. All right. Yeah, just by a little.

626
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Just a little. And add poison to this, right?

627
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,650
What if I put poison on it? Strike.

628
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:47,769
Ooh. Stab. Fight.

629
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:55,559
And you can sing, too.

630
00:54:55,559 --> 00:55:05,860
Make it puke in the test walk. How do you

631
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,219
puke? Ta-da. Flex.

632
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:13,349
Sumo. Hey. Hey, baby.

633
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:17,000
Cutie. Happy. Laugh.

634
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Scared. Angry. Swoon.

635
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,969
Sad. Where is it? Where's puke?

636
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:31,190
Oh. Bounce?

637
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:35,099
Dizzy. Oh, don't do too much.

638
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:39,429
Slow down. Sneeze?

639
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:45,380
That was the cutest thing I've ever seen.

640
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,710
Ballet.

641
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:54,010
Puke. He just stabbed himself in the head.

642
00:55:54,010 --> 00:56:01,670
Lightning? Whoa!

643
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:07,369
Zombie walk? Oh my goodness, it's so

644
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:10,309
weird to control. How about bees?

645
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:18,949
There's an evil laugh?

646
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:25,210
I can't wait to hear the evil laugh.

647
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:32,809
Howl.

648
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:38,059
Banshee scream. Is this Sandperson?

649
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:43,860
Twitch.tv? Blast.

650
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,880
This is so cool. Okay. All right.

651
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,400
All right. Let's go. Stop hurting him.

652
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
This is acting.

653
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,860
I think he's good to go. I think he's perfect.

654
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Somebody put poison on the tip. Can I even do that?

655
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:10,940
Wait. I could put spit

656
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,389
on this, right? Couldn't I?

657
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,389
He's got like a muffin on his tail? Hold on.

658
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:28,539
Okay. Let's have him spit.

659
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:33,019
It's like a combat. Punch. Oh, he's back here.

660
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:36,920
Bite. Strike.

661
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,869
Spit. Just goes into the air?

662
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:46,329
It's got to go to the...

663
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:52,579
Hold on. There we go. Hold on.

664
00:57:52,579 --> 00:58:00,389
So he has like a poison gland that's right

665
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:02,389
there that he can just spit poison

666
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:11,860
at people after stabbing them. It's an anti-air

667
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:15,190
gun. Put it inside the spike.

668
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:24,650
Can I do that? Oh, shit!

669
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:34,300
I almost had it. What was it? Poison

670
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,369
spit. It's the muffin. There it is.

671
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:47,210
That looks kind of good. That looks really

672
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:52,070
good, actually. That looks cool. He has a strike.

673
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,570
He's got the charge.

674
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,769
He goes wham, then spit. Poison

675
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:02,619
spitter. Cool. All right.

676
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:08,440
He's ready. I don't... herbivore.

677
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,900
Why is he an herbivore? Your creature eats fruit.

678
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,900
No, he doesn't. I want him to eat other people

679
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:21,130
because he has the mittens and has no teeth.

680
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:26,820
So I guess with no teeth

681
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,820
and mittens, you're not going to be... So he's

682
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:33,800
just a murderer. Change his mouth?

683
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,550
I am not going to change this mouth.

684
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,110
I don't care if he eats dirt. Change the...

685
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,110
You want me to change? That's what makes all the

686
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,630
personality from this guy. Add another mouth.

687
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,320
Just like a hidden one underneath here?

688
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,980
All right. This is herbivore. Carnivore.

689
00:59:51,980 --> 01:00:11,860
What if I do this?

690
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,860
This is fucking cursed. This is

691
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:30,889
cursed. No.

692
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:33,260
I don't want it. He can eat plants.

693
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:39,719
Yeah, he looks so much better that

694
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,860
way. Yeah, he can eat plants, but if

695
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,860
anyone fucks with him, he's got to...

696
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,340
You can kill them. Make it really small.

697
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,340
Make it just tiny on his tail.

698
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:58,869
I guess I could make just a little

699
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:03,670
little pincer, a little tiny one.

700
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,670
Well, this is carnivore. I could put this

701
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,670
like under here. That would just be kind of like

702
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:18,619
a little thing under his belly. That doesn't

703
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:32,489
look terrible. Make it small enough.

704
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,489
That's just like a little addition. That doesn't mess up with his face.

705
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:36,980
Put it on his nose. Hold on.

706
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:42,789
I want to see what that looks like.

707
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:48,980
I cannot put it on his face.

708
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,980
No, you know what? I don't even want it.

709
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,219
I think it messes with the look. I want him

710
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:55,780
to eat plants. I want him to eat plants.

711
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:01,099
Yeah, I like him like this.

712
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:04,360
I don't want him to eat meat.

713
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,599
I want him to kill meat.

714
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:08,599
Like, I want him to stab meat, but not eat it.

715
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,599
This is a defense mechanism.

716
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:15,530
Okay, what's his name?

717
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:19,750
About, uh...

718
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:31,960
Gorp...Vegan?

719
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:37,340
Vegan. Vegan Bill.

720
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:50,820
Vegan Bill?

721
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:57,800
Is that what you want? Build vegan.

722
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,579
Carnivore Bill. How about, yeah, like

723
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,579
Meat Lover's Bill.

724
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,289
No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to make

725
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:11,699
a circle. I'm going to make a Meat Lover's Pizza.

726
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:17,340
Alright, that's the next thing I'm doing. Save it.

727
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,340
Vegan Bill is a new creation. Replace Bill.

728
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:28,809
Replace Bill.

729
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:30,809
Okay, how many more should I make? Like, two or three?

730
01:03:30,809 --> 01:03:33,500
This is fun. Alright, I'm going to make it to

731
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:45,000
Meat Lover's Pizza. This will be quick.

732
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's just going to be a large Meat Lover's Pizza.

733
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:57,610
Hmm, this is too thick.

734
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:03,800
I know what to do. Make a tiny, tiny

735
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,800
body and a big circle head and just put all the pizza

736
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,380
ingredients on his head. Throw it in the spine.

737
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:14,869
Ah, that's true. Okay.

738
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:23,639
Alright, so this is good. There we go.

739
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:26,010
It needs to be a little bit, like, there.

740
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:31,690
Put this in the oven.

741
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,690
Alright, Meat Lover's Pizza. We need, like, cheese and then sauce.

742
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,820
First of all, let's get the base here.

743
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:42,139
That looks like a pretty good crust.

744
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:52,250
But hold on. That looks like a...

745
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,250
That's perfect. That's a perfect, like, pizza crust.

746
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:59,860
Yup, keeping it.

747
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:03,260
Okay, now we need

748
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,500
details. What have we got?

749
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:10,940
Definitely some fucking basil on there.

750
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,940
No, that comes later. That comes after the sauce. What am I doing?

751
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:22,409
Alright, what, like, pepperonis or something?

752
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:25,800
What looks the most like pizza?

753
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,380
Ingredients. These, I mean, this could be.

754
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:33,099
Custom paint?

755
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:35,099
Do custom paint, custom paint, custom paint.

756
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:39,110
Hold on. Uh.

757
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,110
Paint like, paint like. How do we do custom paint?

758
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,849
Base. Okay, hold on.

759
01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:54,650
A coat? Coat?

760
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:02,010
Yes! Nope, this one.

761
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:06,039
And the detail? Uh.

762
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:11,780
I don't think we need any detail.

763
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,659
I think that's perfect. We need cheese on it, though.

764
01:06:14,659 --> 01:06:16,659
Um. This kind of looks like cheese,

765
01:06:16,659 --> 01:06:19,670
but it's too much. It has to be on top. There we go.

766
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:24,280
That's pretty, that's as close

767
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:32,860
as it's gonna get. Or not, maybe. Hold on.

768
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:44,820
Mmm. Put black olives on it.

769
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:47,960
Hold on, we're not, we gotta, just wait.

770
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:55,510
Change the base color?

771
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:59,420
Disease pizza. Those spots kind of ruin it, though.

772
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:07,079
Change the color of the detail and coat.

773
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:09,079
Nice red pizza sauce.

774
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:11,079
Actually, that, I, I like the other one better, don't you?

775
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:23,989
This one, do you think this one's better?

776
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:25,989
The bright one you think is better? Actually, it probably comes up better.

777
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:30,010
Alright, detail.

778
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:35,690
Detail's gotta be white. Mmm.

779
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:47,380
Cheese. I can hold? Oh, okay.

780
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:58,199
This is probably close to pizza sauce.

781
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,889
Yeah, look at that. That's perfect.

782
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:02,889
Take the spots off. Yeah, I'm taking the spots off.

783
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:06,980
Do you use cheese with something else? Yeah, remove spots.

784
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:18,359
Fix the crust. Hold on.

785
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:23,220
Alright, let's go back here.

786
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:25,659
Now, I, the pizza sauce is up here.

787
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:28,729
Umm. This could be like a sausage

788
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:37,939
or something. Oh, fuck yeah, look at this.

789
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:42,739
Can I make these, uh,

790
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:46,250
like, pepperoni? Can I make them tiny?

791
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:56,340
Can I change the color of these? I don't think

792
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:01,260
I can change the color of those. Of the eyes.

793
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,520
Come on, really? Can't change the eyes?

794
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:12,569
They're just olives. Yeah, but I need

795
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:14,569
how many black, black olives

796
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:27,689
are disgusting on pizza?

797
01:09:27,689 --> 01:09:29,689
All, all olives are like gross.

798
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:40,100
Alright, that's a lot of olives.

799
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:47,020
I need some, oh wait, wait, we need like basil.

800
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:49,020
Actually, I love olive oil. I love it.

801
01:09:49,020 --> 01:10:02,500
So much. Umm, how do I

802
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,430
you hold alt to get just one, right?

803
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:14,579
How come I can't get one? Hold A.

804
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:18,810
I'm thinking like here, bring it down,

805
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,810
flat it, oh yeah, twirl it a little bit.

806
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:24,310
That looks good, so nice and cooked.

807
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,640
And then put it down. That, okay.

808
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:38,439
Twist it up a bit. Nice.

809
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:46,100
Looks good, okay. One more?

810
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:52,819
One more like right here. Get a little more.

811
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:56,970
Okay, cool. Alright, now we need cheese.

812
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,720
We need, there we go.

813
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,619
This could be like weird cheese. That's kind of

814
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:06,060
cheesy. What's more cheesy, do you think?

815
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:15,449
Like this? Flowers could be cheese?

816
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:24,310
What else we got? Horrible.

817
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:28,329
Hold on. This could be like mozzarella.

818
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:31,529
Yeah, that's like a nice mozzarella.

819
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:33,529
Answer me, you flimsy fuck.

820
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:36,149
What are you talking about? The armor plates.

821
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:43,369
Armor plates. That looks like

822
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:45,369
a nice, that looks like a fucking nice

823
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:52,340
slop of mozzarella. Oh, fuck yeah.

824
01:11:52,340 --> 01:12:06,100
Perfect. Yeah, it's like a Neapolitan.

825
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:23,260
I need to move these around a little.

826
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:30,539
Okay, so let me move these around.

827
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:32,539
They need to be a little bigger too, because it's like the big

828
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:36,250
mozzarella circles.

829
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:41,300
There we go, that's better. This is a meat lovers

830
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:47,960
pizza with no meat. That's just regular pizza.

831
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,329
You should make the creature flat.

832
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:53,399
How do I do that though? Can I do that?

833
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:57,819
Can I squish them? What about the pepperoni?

834
01:12:57,819 --> 01:13:02,340
I need something red. Just flatten

835
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,720
them. Miscellaneous parts from the details.

836
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,970
I need red though.

837
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:16,100
Wait, that could be, no. Flatten the

838
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:25,699
armor plates. It's as flat as I can get them.

839
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:30,119
Actually, it's good that they're different sizes though.

840
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:32,119
Like mozzarella does that on pizza all the time.

841
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:41,590
It melts different ways and shit. Oh yeah.

842
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:47,140
Yup. Yup.

843
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:52,649
Do we have warts all over it? Okay, how about

844
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:55,270
if I turn one of these upside down

845
01:13:55,270 --> 01:14:01,859
it might look like a pepperoni.

846
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:03,859
That just

847
01:14:03,859 --> 01:14:07,899
looks fucking weird. I hated that.

848
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:09,899
Alright, he has eyes. It's technically olives.

849
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:17,300
He needs a mouth.

850
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:24,600
Should just have this.

851
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:31,579
It's just like a dragon pizza.

852
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:39,699
Now it's a carnivore. Demon pizza.

853
01:14:39,699 --> 01:14:44,890
And it can sing?

854
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:50,329
He needs feet. Does he?

855
01:14:50,329 --> 01:14:52,329
Even just little tiny ones that you can't

856
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:59,989
even see? Oh hooves.

857
01:14:59,989 --> 01:15:03,579
He needs legs. Hold on.

858
01:15:03,579 --> 01:15:06,260
Do you have wings? Just a flying pizza.

859
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:17,640
That's a good idea. Where are they?

860
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,640
Flying pizza. Wings. Wings. Jump

861
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:24,619
and sprint. Sprint.

862
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:27,369
You don't need feet. Feet aren't required.

863
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:59,180
Okay, well I want him to fly though. This is just

864
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:12,810
unnerving. Does he need a, I don't think he even

865
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:21,000
needs a mouth. It looks like a watermelon.

866
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:34,359
Hold on. I take the mouth away. I mean

867
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:36,859
I like that better. I'm not sure if I'm

868
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:47,350
happy completely with it. Mouth is one part

869
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:49,979
that you actually need. Okay.

870
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:55,800
Ballet. Oh, that's what it would

871
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:06,869
look like if you dropped a pizza on the ground.

872
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:08,869
You know what's funny? I bet you there's a ton of pizza

873
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:10,869
places that have this pizza with wings

874
01:17:10,869 --> 01:17:13,050
on it. And underneath it it says, We Deliver.

875
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:16,630
I mean, doesn't it feel like

876
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:29,819
this would be on the box? A hoedown.

877
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:48,229
He's flipping the pizza around.

878
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,229
Alright, I think I like him. I think that's good.

879
01:17:50,229 --> 01:18:00,010
Mating call. Make the dough

880
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:05,750
brown. Hold on.

881
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:11,829
Let's check here. Brown you say. Hold on.

882
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:18,229
No, the dough's not brown.

883
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:23,270
It's like this. It's like a pizza crust.

884
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:32,789
It looks like a meatball.

885
01:18:32,789 --> 01:18:36,380
This one's better. We go into

886
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:45,510
yellow. Hold on. That's rotten.

887
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:55,300
There we go. Perfect. How do I change

888
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:04,310
his face? Alright, looks good.

889
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:08,409
What's a dragon term

890
01:19:08,409 --> 01:19:12,760
that starts with P? Meat lovers pizza.

891
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:25,289
Pizza angel. Aerodactyl.

892
01:19:25,289 --> 01:19:30,600
Where'd the sauce go? When you're

893
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,699
in the building mode it goes away I think.

894
01:19:34,699 --> 01:19:44,170
Wood fired pizza. That's just describing

895
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,729
what this is on the menu. It's not an

896
01:19:46,729 --> 01:20:01,189
animal's name. Pizza Griffin.

897
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:03,189
Oh my god. Ban that person for at least a

898
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:06,899
minute. Pizza. Wood fired

899
01:20:06,899 --> 01:20:11,899
pizza.

900
01:20:11,899 --> 01:20:14,569
What are people writing? You're writing

901
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:18,859
pterodactyl with pepperoni in it?

902
01:20:18,859 --> 01:20:21,609
Pizzadactyl. Pizzadactyl.

903
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,609
Oh god damn it. I clicked out of the

904
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:28,600
fucking screen. Pizza Griffin is unironically

905
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,600
good. It is not unironically good. It is

906
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:40,840
unironically awful. I like

907
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:49,220
pizzadactyl. How do you spell it?

908
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,659
Pizzadactyly. Pizzadactyly.

909
01:20:51,659 --> 01:21:01,619
Pizzadactyl. Pterodactyl.

910
01:21:01,619 --> 01:21:06,100
I've turned into

911
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,100
pterodactyl. I am now

912
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,100
pterodactyl.

913
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,979
And he flies

914
01:21:12,979 --> 01:21:14,979
and smashes right into the side of like

915
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:18,500
Cleveland's house. And then cuts back to the show.

916
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:32,250
That's good. I like it. Alright. How many more

917
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:40,819
should I make? Carrot. We're making a carrot. It's a carrot.

918
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:50,279
We're making a carrot. And we're gonna make sure that

919
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:53,350
the carrot and the pizza tribes

920
01:21:53,350 --> 01:22:09,220
hate each other. Why are you so hungry?

921
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:19,319
I don't know. I just kinda am. What the fuck does a carrot

922
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:35,560
look like? Like that, right? What the fuck

923
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:37,560
does a carrot look like? It's like that, right? Yeah.

924
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:42,789
And there's green up top. Alright, here we go.

925
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:47,020
What should his face be?

926
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:57,000
It's just one of the birds from Angry Birds.

927
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:07,239
Why is everybody freaking out? It looks like a

928
01:23:07,239 --> 01:23:10,949
squash. This is what a carrot

929
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:13,960
looks like when you pull it out of the ground. What are you talking about?

930
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:33,210
Give him a scary mouth. I like that.

931
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:39,399
Let's get the, uh, the, let's get

932
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:51,989
this correct. Too much spinning. There you go.

933
01:23:51,989 --> 01:24:00,420
Okay, good. Yes!

934
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:05,720
The cabbage. This guy is so

935
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,020
hungry. Why would, okay, let me

936
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:12,310
let's get something clear here. If

937
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:14,310
somebody is like starving and really hungry

938
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:16,310
and they're on stream, they're a streamer,

939
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:18,869
you think they would be making a carrot?

940
01:24:18,869 --> 01:24:21,750
No. They would be making like steak

941
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:23,750
and cheese subs and like hamburgers and stuff.

942
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,500
I make a carrot? A carrot.

943
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:32,069
You guys think, oh, he's so high right now

944
01:24:32,069 --> 01:24:34,949
and all he can think about is food.

945
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:36,949
I can't think of one person I've ever seen that's ever been

946
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:38,949
high and you go, hey Ben, you wanna get some

947
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,500
munchies? Yeah.

948
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:44,890
How many carrots? I got fucking Doritos

949
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,890
and pizza and fuck, and hamburgers?

950
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:49,770
You don't wanna, wanna eat a carrot?

951
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:53,979
I've never heard that before. I've never heard,

952
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:55,979
somebody's never been high and asked me for a carrot. I'm just

953
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:00,010
gonna tell you guys the truth, that's never happened.

954
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:02,010
You know how many times somebody's been over here high

955
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,010
or over my, or like hanging out with me

956
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:06,180
high in my life and they've gone into

957
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,180
like the pantry and they're like

958
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,180
where are the Doritos?

959
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:17,989
Where are your carrots? You just get

960
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:21,510
high all the time. He hangs out with

961
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:25,739
stoners. Ha! Alright.

962
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:27,739
This is bullshit.

963
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:29,739
There's no way that you guys have, this is

964
01:25:29,739 --> 01:25:31,979
a gaslighting campaign.

965
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:33,979
I don't think there's ever been a point where

966
01:25:33,979 --> 01:25:35,979
one of you was asked for a carrot when you were high.

967
01:25:35,979 --> 01:25:39,239
If you were, ever.

968
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,239
No, you reached for like the fucking beef

969
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:46,300
jerky and the Dorito bags.

970
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,300
I don't do drugs, Jerma. Well, good for

971
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,300
you, cause don't do them cause they're not that cool.

972
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,300
They're like kind of dumb.

973
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,010
All I'm saying is I've never asked for a

974
01:25:56,010 --> 01:26:01,060
carrot when I was high.

975
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,060
Hey man, you got like any bags of like

976
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,060
iceberg lettuce just plain that I can just reach into

977
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:14,859
and just eat? That's a base

978
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:16,859
take. I don't think that's even a

979
01:26:16,859 --> 01:26:18,859
I think that's just like, that's not abnormal.

980
01:26:18,859 --> 01:26:25,189
Don't they have like weird roots all over

981
01:26:25,189 --> 01:26:33,300
them?

982
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:38,939
Let me go for eyes.

983
01:26:38,939 --> 01:27:06,439
Okay, I like it.

984
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:10,470
I like it. You made a stoner

985
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:24,659
carrot.

986
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:26,659
Does make up the eye of Sauron? No.

987
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:31,460
I love this carrot guy.

988
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:36,569
Alright, let me uh, we need

989
01:27:36,569 --> 01:27:43,539
like root legs. Armored bones?

990
01:27:43,539 --> 01:27:49,029
These have to be little. No, not even

991
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:51,029
no legs, right? This is a carrot.

992
01:27:51,029 --> 01:28:12,579
Does it need a leg? Does it need legs?

993
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:23,140
This is so scary. I don't think I need to do anything else.

994
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:32,470
Yeah, I think it's just a carrot.

995
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:40,520
Does it need anything? It needs a stem.

996
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,550
Carrot? What do you mean? Make a baby click the egg.

997
01:28:44,550 --> 01:29:34,329
Oh, that was cool. Hold down!

998
01:29:34,329 --> 01:29:36,819
I don't think it needs anything. He has a mouth.

999
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:40,020
He can bite. He can sing.

1000
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:45,979
And he has charm. I'm not doing

1001
01:29:45,979 --> 01:30:15,340
anything else. Plat in the top? He's perfect

1002
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:34,140
like this. Living carrot.

1003
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:49,800
I mean ruined. Carrot griffin.

1004
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,420
Munchies carrot? Oh, I can't wait to go grab

1005
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:55,239
a carrot out of the fridge.

1006
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:59,460
What about texture? Oh shit, that's right. I think it's

1007
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,460
actually kind of, I don't think it needs anything.

1008
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:15,909
I don't think it needs any texture at all. Yeah, that's

1009
01:31:15,909 --> 01:31:24,619
just a healthy carrot. Okay.

1010
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:35,159
I'm not going to name a weed carrot.

1011
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:42,949
Kakarot. How about just

1012
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:53,770
snipe? I kind of like snipe.

1013
01:31:53,770 --> 01:31:59,140
How about crunchy?

1014
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:02,390
Crunch. Crunch.

1015
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:17,159
Orange crunch. Carrot?

1016
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:29,560
Carrot. Karen.

1017
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:34,979
Crunky. Pella carrot.

1018
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:38,949
Yeah, but all these names like, okay, like

1019
01:32:38,949 --> 01:32:41,130
Pizzadactyl, Pella carrot.

1020
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:44,199
These are Pokemon names.

1021
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:46,199
You just say what the

1022
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,500
thing looks like and then

1023
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
what its face looks like.

1024
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,470
Like what the thing's body is shaped as

1025
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,470
and what its face looks like. You just do two words.

1026
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,840
Pelican face, carrot

1027
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:05,500
body. Pella carrot. I like

1028
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:14,180
it. It's fine. So I didn't say

1029
01:33:14,180 --> 01:34:05,699
there's nothing wrong with it. Alright, um

01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:17,850
I'll be very specific reason why because all you're gonna be able to do is click on the parts

1076
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:30,039
How are you gonna make the shape a hundred million? Give me a break. That's nothing. Let us play you dick

Throat spore the choices you make impact your future as a cell

1133
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:26,050
Your mission is to eat grow and evolve growth is measured in your progress bar below

1134
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:32,909
That's your progress bar as you eat you'll earn DNA points

1135
01:54:32,989 --> 01:54:39,029
You may spend these points on new parts to evolve yourself as you progress you grow larger and your world expands

1136
01:54:40,439 --> 01:54:43,409
Mmm, you need to get DNA points

1137
01:54:43,409 --> 01:54:50,239
Then you spend those DNA points on new parts your carnivore hunt other cells or swim over floating meat to eat it

1138
01:54:50,239 --> 01:55:09,310
Eat that eat that why did you not eat that? Oh, I got it. I could eat all these other bugs

1141
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:38,239
Each part is unique abilities that can benefit your cell

1142
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:45,590
When you see the new part appear swim over the token to collect it the game doesn't have autosave

It's timeline shows a history the actions you've taken during life as a cell

1269
02:29:47,649 --> 02:29:52,229
You've established a trait which earns you unique abilities that will benefit your future generations

1270
02:29:52,229 --> 02:29:58,459
which path have you chosen goes in the path of the killer and then I've

1271
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:08,469
Rescinded my ways and went up to the path of the omnivore cool

1272
02:30:08,469 --> 02:30:18,360
Okay, finish the cell stage and clamor on to the planet's surface. Ooh

1273

1282
02:33:07,879 --> 02:33:31,069
Well, whatever that's fine. He's got a big proboscis, but whatever it is. Don't give him eyes. The horns good for attacking

1286
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:36,680
Of course it does you need fins for jump. Hold on. Do I fins for jump fins for jump?

1287
02:34:36,680 --> 02:35:04,299
I thought I deleted those I put one fin on my back. It's so ugly

1288
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:13,750
Spit is crucial. Well, I mean how many little how many devices am I gonna have on this guy? He's got a

02:35:14,309 --> 02:35:17,750
Stabhorn he's got a glowing egg. He's got fins. He's now as his spitter

1293
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:36,600
All right, let's do it. Reach your stage randomizing data arch types excreting gastrodermical system

1294
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:46,819
Reticulating spines. Oh, we got somebody from Maxis Maxis Maxis Maxis Maxis Maxis. Where am I?

1295
02:36:47,139 --> 02:36:58,739
Where are my people? Where are the people that I made? I thought you guys said to make a shitload of people

1296
02:36:58,739 --> 02:37:08,760
So they would be in the game. You made that for the tribal stage. Oh

1546
03:35:47,559 --> 03:35:51,079
The first rule of improv is to say bones when you can't think of anything to say

1547
03:35:53,819 --> 03:36:00,790
Nothing about that's a really good way to look at it when there's nothing else to say

1548
03:36:01,510 --> 03:36:09,750
Just say bones. Hmm. I wonder how accurate that really is. I'm that person out for an hour, by the way

03:36:14,790 --> 03:36:26,420

All right. Next up. Where are these guys? Oh, they're over there. Can I do that? No, where was that species?

Look, I know I'm gonna walk in the ocean and my games gonna crash and it's gonna corrupt my fucking save file or something

1878
04:43:36,990 --> 04:43:39,709
I know so badly you want to ruin this game

1879
04:43:39,790 --> 04:43:44,409
You so badly wanted me to go into the ocean and like die and have the game crash

1880
04:43:44,529 --> 04:43:52,520
You want like take me to get sucked into the ocean and have everybody die. I got to get it

1881
04:43:52,520 --> 04:44:28,139
I'm getting rid of him. I want a cow. All I need is gronk. Gronk is literally all I need is the crew

1882
04:44:28,259 --> 04:44:37,009
Spike guy is better than gronk. What did what did you just say? Why did you just say that?

1883
04:44:37,009 --> 04:44:54,209
I'm so fucking I'm shocked that somebody would say that run him into a geyser. Here we go. Here's the Wizard of Oz

1884
04:44:59,659 --> 04:45:01,659
Oh

1885
04:45:02,680 --> 04:45:14,040
Let's go this way follow the yellow brick road follow the yellow brick road

1886
04:45:22,740 --> 04:45:26,720
Just follow the yellow brick road and we will find

1887
04:45:29,639 --> 04:45:38,639
We're okay

1888
04:45:38,639 --> 04:45:47,340
This rat dead

1889
04:45:47,459 --> 04:46:07,900
Why did this happen? Why did this happen? Why did this happen? Get the fuck out of here?

1890
04:46:08,740 --> 04:46:20,389
Why did that happen? No, don't ow. I'm a mating call. I need to eat

1891
04:46:21,979 --> 04:46:40,779
Reload reload reload. I'm gonna reload after I go in the ocean. Okay, here we go. Let's go in the ocean

1892
04:46:41,220 --> 04:47:04,340
Cool. All right. There it is. You got to see it

1893
04:47:04,340 --> 04:47:11,770
You get the same thing you wanted to see the whole time because you wanted the whole time for almost five hours

1894
04:47:11,770 --> 04:47:32,189
How I load don't save all progress will be lost. Wait, don't save right? Yeah, this is the main menu, right?

1895
04:47:32,189 --> 04:47:38,060
Let's just get out of here. That's worded real weirdly. That's worded weirdly all

1896
04:47:40,130 --> 04:47:42,729
Progress will be lost. So you what? Why are you saying that?

1897
04:47:44,520 --> 04:48:08,569
Alright, let's go. Alright, here we are. We're good. It's time for us to progress. I guess I could level up one more time

1898
04:48:08,569 --> 04:48:10,569
Alright, goodbye. I'm missing clowns

1899
04:48:10,770 --> 04:48:12,639
Bye clowns

1900
04:48:12,639 --> 04:48:25,459
You sneak we could sneak couldn't we? Why is the cow not sneaking? We just startled him

1901
04:48:26,020 --> 04:48:31,919
Just click the button. Alright, here we go. Three two one go

1902
04:48:32,080 --> 04:48:40,130
Your actions as a creature have earned another trait that defines your species new unique abilities await you in the tribal stage

1903
04:48:46,090 --> 04:49:04,099
Adaptable very cool final stage. I'm not sure if there's anything I really need to change here

1904
04:49:04,240 --> 04:49:14,700
Cuz I already did this you could get the final feat but I can only do one

1905
04:49:15,220 --> 04:49:27,200
Sneak and dance our back our back feet

1906
04:49:27,639 --> 04:49:32,419
You were the final wings which one actually carries over in matters at all

1907
04:49:32,779 --> 04:49:41,569
Keep the human feet stats didn't so stats do not matter at all. Nothing. None of this matters. Okay, so I want the better wings

1908
04:49:41,569 --> 04:49:47,180
I don't like these. Yeah, those are much more majestic

1909
04:49:47,599 --> 04:50:05,700
There we go. That's much more majestic

1910
04:50:06,139 --> 04:50:16,000
Only speed and weapons will carry over. Okay. Well none

1911
04:50:16,319 --> 04:50:33,240
Nothing gives me speed here strike five eat give speed these ones don't sneak dance and speed

1912
04:50:33,240 --> 04:51:11,680
Oh, yes, they do. Oh shit. Leave one fucking dollar. Okay, cool

1913
04:51:11,680 --> 04:51:21,080
Fuck the spit sell your sell the body spit matters the spit matters. Just wait a second

1914
04:51:21,520 --> 04:51:27,479
Don't need four legs, you know, that's true at this point

1915
04:51:27,479 --> 04:51:41,939
I don't need these feet anymore so I can sell the I can just stand up we can go full stand up

1916
04:51:42,259 --> 04:51:50,250
Yeah, let's stand up. Let's go

1917
04:51:55,569 --> 04:52:33,020
Here he goes by pedal. We got it and slim him down a little except for down here thigh gap

1918
04:52:33,020 --> 04:52:54,540
What is too big? That's pretty good. I'm kind of happy with this

1919
04:52:54,700 --> 04:53:28,909
We can involve that away and make it a tail. They make a front tail. Yeah, that's a good idea

1920
04:53:28,909 --> 04:53:36,060
I'll do that right now. Okay. Now I have some money

1921
04:53:36,080 --> 04:53:41,459
What about the face if stats don't matter then we're looking for health

1922
04:53:41,459 --> 04:53:50,720
It's the highest health I have all right eat gross feet gross feet gross stop

1923
04:53:50,720 --> 04:54:25,529
But the wings at shoulder height put one wing health speed sneak and spit are good while I have glide

1924
04:54:26,049 --> 04:54:38,580
Sneak five sing for five dance rotate the wings

1925
04:54:39,220 --> 04:54:41,290
There we go

1926
04:54:41,290 --> 04:55:00,319
That's run just to make sure kind of a fucked up walk at the better legs. I'm losing my mind

1927
04:55:00,459 --> 04:55:18,950
All right, hold on man. Let me the better legs. These are just speed one. They're all speed one. They look better

1928
04:55:18,950 --> 04:56:08,369
I could just they're like crab legs. Look two legs even come out from like here actually kind of good

1929
04:56:08,369 --> 04:56:32,610
Oh much worse. They look like melted plastic and then I need the feet. Yeah, it's a little too long

1930
04:56:32,630 --> 04:56:37,029
That's a little too long. Don't you think his torso is really long?

1931
04:56:46,650 --> 04:56:50,669
Ultimate being I just like squished him a little and now he's all right

1932
04:56:50,669 --> 04:57:24,669
Hold on the complete evolution is finished that this looks so out of place

1933
04:57:24,889 --> 04:57:42,049
No, that looks like he's wearing a mask or something. There we go

1934
04:57:42,049 --> 04:58:06,049
And he's like a little hat or something a little a little hat. No don't like it

1935
04:58:06,049 --> 04:58:35,310
I somehow made him look even worse. It's the eyes the eyes gonna change and he's like tilt them. That's better. Okay, good

1936
04:58:35,310 --> 04:59:13,790
All right, he's fucking stacked spine needs to be a little more aligned this way. There it is. Perfect. That's it

1937
04:59:13,790 --> 04:59:18,959
What about his final?

1938
04:59:18,959 --> 04:59:37,560
His final color scheme. So, let's see what we got. Whoa. Whoa

1939
04:59:38,080 --> 04:59:58,750
Geez, okay, that's they're giving like the patches need thumbs

1940
04:59:59,049 --> 05:00:08,319
Didn't have thumbs I kind of like the stuffed animal look

1941
05:00:14,069 --> 05:00:44,080
This is like a muscle tissue get thumbs. Holy shit. This is disgusting. Mmm. What about this one? This one's not bad

1942
05:00:44,159 --> 05:00:56,689
That's kind of German on eight five colors. I guess we could make it ourselves, right?

1943
05:00:56,849 --> 05:01:26,500
That's a good German on eight five base. Okay, where's green more green? No more teal right here

1944
05:01:26,500 --> 05:01:59,750
I need teal and then the coat is gonna be see I've been load and in the detail you just have fucking chicken

1945
05:01:59,750 --> 05:02:20,680

Tribal stage. Where am I?

1973
05:09:12,750 --> 05:09:27,619
Where am I? Where are they? I may I spent like two and a half hours making creatures and we haven't seen any

1974
05:09:28,099 --> 05:09:33,130
The roof over your head and fire at your fingertips you enter the age of hand tools and trumpets

1975
05:09:33,470 --> 05:09:37,659
But beware soon rival tribes or form across the globe be vigilant

1976
05:09:37,959 --> 05:09:42,060
You now command a burgeoning tribe of three

1977
05:09:42,319 --> 05:09:46,080
You may select individual tribe members or a group to do your bidding

1978
05:09:46,200 --> 05:09:49,919
You must interact with the other tribes to move your progress bar forward. Let's take a look

1979
05:09:50,060 --> 05:09:55,479
This is your progress bar. You must ally or conquer other tribes to

Holy shit. Those are huge advance your own these goals will help guide you through tribal life

1981
05:10:03,889 --> 05:10:08,939
Your first task is to dress your tribe in the new tribal outfitter check click on your hut

1983
05:10:16,439 --> 05:10:18,340

Body ages this is ten. There we go. Okay

1988
05:11:10,979 --> 05:11:12,060

Spore gears was this mustache a ring

1990
05:11:22,349 --> 05:11:29,119

05:11:30,650 --> 05:11:53,590
Gathering social and gathering now. I know what you mean by he shouldn't have the horn. This is a huge hat

1992
05:11:54,189 --> 05:12:03,130
Okay, I need a mask combat and social social

1994
05:12:28,750 --> 05:12:47,880

1995
05:12:54,520 --> 05:13:00,209
Mustache and

1996
05:13:00,209 --> 05:13:08,509
Rings, okay rings here

1998
05:13:20,509 --> 05:13:43,529
Um on here, I think it's good a cock ring on one

1999
05:13:43,529 --> 05:13:58,409
You cannot move the camera freely around the world

2000
05:13:58,409 --> 05:14:01,209
This helps you check in on tribe members or groups to whom you have given orders

2001
05:14:01,209 --> 05:14:05,599
Let's pause for a moment and learn the basic camera controls. We get RTS now

2002
05:14:05,599 --> 05:14:11,849
Yeah, these controls allow you to zoom and rotate the camera. Sure your mouse wheel can also zoom and rotate

2003
05:14:11,849 --> 05:14:17,689
Let's try that Oh left and right mouse button and whatever that rotates the camera

2004
05:14:17,729 --> 05:14:24,540
This is in and out use the arrow keys or click the right mouse button to pan the camera. Mm-hmm

2005
05:14:24,900 --> 05:14:30,020
Good click on the hut icon on the mini-map to focus the camera back on your tribe

2006
05:14:30,540 --> 05:14:43,630
Your tribe members portrait in the tribal is to select an individual click and drag a box around multiple tribe members

2007
05:14:43,630 --> 05:14:51,740
And yeah, you can do that and RTS. Let's begin to find some food. Okay, save it. You guys said Gronk was gone

2008
05:14:54,169 --> 05:15:03,720
No, he's not I got a rat I got a cow and I got a grunt perfect

2009
05:15:03,880 --> 05:15:17,580
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow start probably on the same time. So around 430 or so Pacific. Thanks for watching

2010
05:15:17,700 --> 05:15:25,479
We'll see you tomorrow. We'll pick up right here and do the tribe stage and then we'll do probably the space stage

2011
05:15:25,479 --> 05:15:46,520
Right. Sounds like a plan to me. Thanks everybody. Here come the subscriptions all the subs today. Thank you. Everybody. Appreciate you appreciate the

2012
05:15:48,419 --> 05:15:51,840
Continued insane support this channel gets some like I told you a lot of times

2014
05:16:03,400 --> 05:16:09,810
We'll go somewhere and the pigment pole. That's a good a point really good point. All right, I'm gonna play after spore

2015
05:16:09,889 --> 05:16:17,340
I'm gonna play Pikmin. That's not as rare to find as thousand-year-do apparently

2016
05:16:17,459 --> 05:16:23,259
So am I gonna start what am I what am I because here's I'm gonna tell you the truth

2017
05:16:23,259 --> 05:16:28,779
I'm probably not gonna play all the Pikmin's. We're probably just gonna do one

2018
05:16:28,779 --> 05:16:38,069
I don't think I'm gonna aren't they all very very similar. I'm probably gonna play one of them, right?

2019
05:16:38,069 --> 05:16:45,860
I don't think I want to play all three or four Pikmin games or maybe we'll I don't know

2020

You kooza will be coming back. Apparently Pikmin 2 is winning by a very large margin

2033
05:18:08,779 --> 05:18:19,569
Seems to be an unreachable margin at this point. You also promised Mega Man Legends 2

2036
05:18:39,409 --> 05:18:45,069
