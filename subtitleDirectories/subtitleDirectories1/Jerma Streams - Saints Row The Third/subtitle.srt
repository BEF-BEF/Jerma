1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:25,809
What's happening? Hey, I'm back on my part two of three of times where I'm going to disappear for like two and a half weeks, or one week or whatever. Ten days.

2
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:30,239
That was the second time in the last two months. There's gonna be one more.

3
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:36,439
Not right now though, don't worry. Got a couple weeks here of just chillin'.

4
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:57,729
Saints Row, yeah. Saints Row. You gotta pre-stream chat, guys. Pre-stream chat. I would start participating.

5
00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:06,799
They hold a lot of power. Let me break it down.

6
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:14,040
Every time there's a stream, let's say a stream is scheduled for two o'clock.

7
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,219
Or four o'clock, whatever. Somewhere around like one to three p.m. I will come in here.

8
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:24,459
And I'll say, hey, what's up, guys? How are you? What's going on, everybody?

9
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:30,950
And we'll go, Jerma! Oh, Jerma, what's up, man? Oh my god, he's here! Oh my god, I'm such a huge fan.

10
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,129
Nobody says anything else negative or anything like that.

11
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:38,819
They're always very supportive. They never tell me to leave every time.

12
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,819
I don't see, in all capitals, leave anytime I write a message, which I don't get that, by the way.

13
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:52,590
Every time I've talked in the pre-stream chat, everybody just says leave at the same time.

14
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:02,049
Hey, this is my chat here, okay? If I want to poke in... Look, this is my house.

15
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,659
We literally did that today. Yeah, you do it every day.

16
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:19,069
Regardless of the mean nature of some of the pre-stream chat, we talk.

17
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,250
I kind of chill in the pre-stream for like 10 to 20 minutes, usually.

18
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,060
Well, I say that I write like three messages, but I'm there watching.

19
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,930
I put a poll up. Here's three or four games that I want to play.

20
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,930
Which one do you guys want to see?

21
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,930
So let me tell you what the non pre-stream chat viewers have missed out on.

22
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,740
They voted today for Saints Row 3.

23
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,180
There was Chivalry 2 was on that list. It got three votes.

24
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm not making that up.

25
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Out of, I think, one, maybe I think like two or three hundred people in pre-stream.

26
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,180
I think three people clicked Chivalry 2. I was very surprised.

27
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:07,280
I mean, I'm probably going to play at some point.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,300
What's this emote? Germa cheesed. I don't know.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
I don't know. I don't know what it is. I can't even see it.

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:26,370
What is it? I just see the text. I don't know why I can't see it.

31
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,210
What does it look like?

32
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,939
You uploaded it. I did not.

33
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:43,889
I have given my mods complete and total creative control for every single emote on BTTV.

34
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:51,020
I don't even know what they are.

35
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,770
You personally uploaded it.

36
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,770
But I've been away for a while working on stuff, doing some personal life things.

37
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:07,969
I'm sure some of you guys have seen the picture of me, what it looks like officiating a wedding.

38
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:13,270
I don't know where that photo is from. I'm going to. I didn't do that.

39
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,269
Very strange. Somebody. I mean, I got Photoshopped into that somehow.

40
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:28,579
People called me. People calling me priest Andy.

41
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:32,579
No, Community Jake got married. And that's kind of where it was.

42
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,579
I officiated Community Jake's wedding, which is crazy, right?

43
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,759
I've never done that before, but it was a beautiful ceremony.

44
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,759
Two really great people. So I was more than happy to.

45
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,899
No, I'm not. I'm not ordained.

46
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:59,199
Hey, I just want to ask, dude, what's wrong with you? Love the streams, by the way.

47
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,199
That's a loaded question. How do I answer that in five seconds?

48
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,209
Actually, I can. No, I could. I could answer that.

49
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:13,209
What's wrong? I ate Captain Crunch every day for like breakfast, lunch and dinner for about four straight years when I was a kid.

50
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:15,209
There you go. This is your answer.

51
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:22,990
I'm in. I'm a bell. I'm embellishing.

52
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,990
I did not have it. I'm kidding.

53
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,259
And only for I would say probably like a year or two years.

54
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,259
I ate Captain Crunch every single day. It's got vitamins in it.

55
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,180
That's not the only thing I ate.

56
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,180
People take the things I say here when I'm fucking around and they act like, Holy shit.

57
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,180
Of course, he's a weird guy. He ate Captain Crunch for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Nobody would do that.

58
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:56,290
Nobody. I'm kidding. Who would do that?

59
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:07,079
This dude has a lack of neurons now. I do not have a lack of neurons.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:13,279
Yeah. OK. OK. Lack of. Oh, he's got a lack of neurons.

61
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,279
He's killing. Oh, he killed all his brain cells by eating Captain Crunch.

62
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:23,269
How many times a week do you smoke weed? Yeah. Yeah. OK.

63
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:34,509
Don't don't come at me on the high road here. None. I don't do that.

64
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:40,180
Some of you do. This is PR. He's projecting, projecting on Megalo.

65
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:47,519
You're a bad influence. I really hope not.

66
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,139
Look, what the fuck is this emote?

67
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,050
I'm looking at the mod chat right now. This is what that is.

68
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02,620
Who allowed that? Who allowed that? That shouldn't be allowed.

69
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:11,170
That's a horrible looking. Eat human, eat human food.

70
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,170
Guys, I eat plenty of greens, plenty of vegetables.

71
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,540
I have a pretty balanced diet.

72
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,610
I try to I try to eat not too much meat, but enough meat because I like I like meat.

73
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:32,420
Try to balance it out a little bit. Yeah, it's good to see you again.

74
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll be back the next couple of weeks. I'll be here pretty normally.

75
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,600
Two, three times a week like you're used to.

76
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:48,810
Then, oh, we've got the German Baseball Association, which is I'm very excited about that.

77
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,810
And then we've got we've got the green screen stream, ladies and gentlemen, the green screen stream.

78
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,370
Thank you for all of your submissions.

79
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,930
There were thousands of submissions.

80
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,360
There's no way I'm going to be able to do them all.

81
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,360
They've been narrowed down to a a doable amount.

82
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,920
Had to narrow down thousands of these submissions.

83
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,170
So on June 30th, mark that on your calendar.

84
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:26,370
I will be in front of the green screen doing all of your favorite all of your favorite actions.

85
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:35,179
Also, something else really cool on the 27th.

86
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:45,980
So in two days from now, Miss Kip is running a smite tournament, a one hundred thousand dollar tournament.

87
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:54,259
I am a team captain. I am a team captain for this tournament.

88
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:03,649
Who's on the team? The team is.

89
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:10,340
OK, here we go. Me, Poke Lulz, Russell.

90
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:26,049
Sure for. And then the final contestant is NoCo with our coach being weakened.

91
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,019
This is going to be a good fucking team.

92
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,860
These are going to be cringe, Andy. I didn't even do anything.

93
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:42,909
Just watch just watch us just roll over the competition. OK.

94
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,299
Have you guys practiced? Not once.

95
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,299
I, as team captain, have called for a practice.

96
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:56,659
I wrote a I literally wrote a paragraph and nobody responded.

97
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:07,649
I think we're going to hopefully get together at least.

98
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,649
Look, can we type practice? Right.

99
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:19,419
I wonder if that would work. Is typing practice?

100
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,419
What? OK, in in a in a discord group, right?

101
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,940
Just kind of be like, all right, so you go down that way.

102
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
You got out. Well, do we have to actually do it?

103
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:43,240
I think most people in the competition, I don't think I don't know if there's very many people that are really amazing at the game.

104
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I don't I don't know. I know what some of the teams by now.

105
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
There's a lot of people involved. I mean, I think we've got a pretty good shot.

106
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Have you guys seen? Have you guys seen my Anubis?

107
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
You guys have watched me not miss a single mummify.

108
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,039
I'm telling you right. This picks and bans.

109
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,409
They let me get Anubis. It's fucking over.

110
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:10,340
It's over. I don't know what their plan is to broadcast.

111
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,340
I think I'm sure there'll be people probably commenting it.

112
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,159
I don't know. Should be really fun. Sounds like a fun team.

113
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:24,259
Who else was I good at? I remember those.

114
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,259
You don't know that Anubis got nerfed. That doesn't matter.

115
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,720
I could be the worst God in the game and I'd still do all right with it.

116
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,990
You're Anubis. Guys, it's this is all psychological.

117
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:43,990
OK, if everybody thinks that I'm really fucking good with this character, then they're going to freak out.

118
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,990
Just shut up. I have a plan.

119
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,990
You don't understand the psychology here.

120
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,129
The more I talk about Anubis, they're going to fucking ban Anubis.

121
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,129
And who gives a shit? That character sucks.

122
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,129
Do you get it? Are you understanding this now?

123
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,129
Can you please just relax and let me do what I'm doing as a team captain?

124
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,419
For God's sakes, would you let me do what I'm doing as a team captain?

125
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:10,100
Quiet enough. I don't want you to screw this up for me.

126
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,159
And then good. Look, all you guys are going to go to the other teams.

127
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,159
He's actually the Anubis thing is a joke.

128
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,159
And then they won't ban Anubis.

129
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,159
And then I get like 20 kills in one game with Anubis.

130
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,000
It's all psychology. I'm glad you guys get it.

131
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,360
He wants the money.

132
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,340
I just want to I think I thought it was a fun idea.

133
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,500
All right, you guys ready? Let's get going.

134
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
It's good to see everybody. Hope you're all doing well.

135
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,370
Did I tweet? I did. He wants the money.

136
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,440
So this is Saints Row 3.

137
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
I have never played Saints Row 3, just like when it was Saints Row 2.

138
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,740
I think maybe I was in the menu.

139
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Maybe I went to the first area. I don't know.

140
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,840
I don't have any memory of playing it.

141
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,840
But there's your plan for the week.

142
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,139
We got bang Saints Row 3 tonight.

143
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,139
27th Smite hundred thousand dollar tournament, which we are guaranteed to win.

144
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,450
And then the 30th green screen.

145
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,450
Let's go. Stacked fucking week. Stacked week.

146
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,950
OK, let's go. Saints Row.

147
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:48,580
Can you hear it? We can now.

148
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,659
Can you see me?

149
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,019
You know, I guess notice I've been doing face cam every single day now.

150
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,019
That's complete. That's unheard of.

151
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:03,259
Can you guys remember a time when I ever did this?

152
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,649
And I don't even know why I'm doing it. You know what I mean?

153
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,649
I don't even know why I started doing this.

154
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:18,139
It just I just sort of started doing this.

155
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:26,299
Right. I was a no face cam guy forever for almost 10 straight years.

156
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,299
And then I played Elden Ring and kept the face cam on.

157
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,299
And now it's just on permanently.

158
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:35,269
I don't know. I don't know. I don't even want this on.

159
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:40,269
I don't want this on. And I'm going to turn it off immediately if I get if I feel like it.

160
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:43,769
The second that I don't care anymore, it's going off like I'm a weirdo.

161
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,940
Whatever. All right, let's go. New campaign.

162
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Normal. We're not playing hardcore.

163
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,269
How is it? Is it loud? How loud is it?

164
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:59,529
That looks fine. 60.

165
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,600
All right. Quiet. Here comes the opening cutscene.

166
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,509
Quiet. This game has DMCA songs.

167
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,509
I don't I don't even care.

168
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm sorry. I just don't anymore.

169
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Conquest. That's what we're playing, by the way, in the Smite one hundred thousand dollar tournament.

170
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
It's Conquest 5v5.

171
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:31,870
We're not doing an arena. I haven't played Conquest in five years at least.

172
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,889
We're going to lose.

173
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,320
If I play mage and I do mid, I'm going to miss every rotation.

174
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm probably going to go 0 and 15 or something.

175
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:47,529
No, I don't think so. I think I'll be all right.

176
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,980
Dude, you suck at Smite.

177
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,980
No, I don't.

178
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,779
I don't suck at Smite.

179
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,779
Okay.

180
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,779
Loading into a game that you haven't loaded for two or three straight years

181
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:10,779
and you jump into Conquest when the meta has changed completely is you can't.

182
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,779
It's not just like getting back in there and just, oh, yeah, I'm going to go 10 and 0.

183
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,779
No matter what, that's not going to happen. You're going to lose.

184
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:26,809
I stream the game one fucking time and get my ass kicked by a bunch of other people that we're playing every day.

185
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:29,299
I'll be just fine.

186
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:43,220
What about the lore? Energy drink?

187
00:16:43,220 --> 00:17:02,590
Can I do that? What?

188
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:09,869
Oh, it's an ad. Okay.

189
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,869
Japanese commercials. Easiest money you'll ever make.

190
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,869
Grand Lawson is right up there. You ready for this?

191
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,869
Is this 30 FPS?

192
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,740
I do my own stunts.

193
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Hey, you're just a ride along, man.

194
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
What the hell?

195
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I am a method actor.

196
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,299
If I'm going to play a saint with any degree of emotional truth, I got to make it real.

197
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,779
Is this 30 FPS?

198
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,180
It'll be real.

199
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,180
You're robbing a bank dressed like yourselves.

200
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Hell yeah. Who doesn't want to be Johnny yet?

201
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Ultra postmodernism.

202
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:54,359
Who cares if it's 30 FPS?

203
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,359
But do we really got to drag this asshole actor around?

204
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,359
Cut Josh some slack. He's just researching his part.

205
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,359
I hope he signed a waiver.

206
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,359
Alright, people.

207
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,589
But he died.

208
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,589
Sorry, jumps his line. Can we go again?

209
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,589
You all know the drill.

210
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,589
This game came out in the 60s. No, it didn't.

211
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,589
What are you talking about?

212
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,589
Can I get a picture with the boss?

213
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:20,589
Say sleaze.

214
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,589
Get in line, bitch.

215
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,589
Hey, don't be a dick.

216
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,589
Do you call yourself gang bangers?

217
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,589
You're a bunch of pussies.

218
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:36,630
We should be all up in there shit like fuck.

219
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,509
I don't know. That's different.

220
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,509
This game is older than you. It is not.

221
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:48,279
We're just shooting all these words to me.

222
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:53,849
Wait, it's time to play?

223
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,380
Is it time to play?

224
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Okay, now it's 60 FPS.

225
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,539
What's happening?

226
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,539
I thought that was a fucking person.

227
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:13,059
The one thing that I shoot at.

228
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,059
I have it on ultra graphics, by the way.

229
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,009
Let's find that bomb.

230
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,779
Can I switch between people?

231
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:31,339
Alright, where do I go?

232
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,339
Is there a melee? What's melee?

233
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,450
We can't go in? Alright, let's go.

234
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:45,829
What's melee?

235
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:48,829
Okay.

236
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:54,579
Is there screen shake?

237
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:56,579
It's not really.

238
00:19:56,579 --> 00:19:59,200
It's barely screen shake.

239
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,210
The audio sounds weird to me.

240
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,519
I gotta change the audio.

241
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,589
The audio sounds weird, right?

242
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,170
You know what I was trying to do.

243
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,440
Audio shake.

244
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,769
How do you sprint?

245
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:48,750
Alright, go upstairs.

246
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,500
Shift? I got a controller. How do I do it?

247
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:58,289
Left bumper?

248
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,289
No. It's already way too big.

249
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:05,549
Why are you not playing the remaster?

250
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:07,549
I didn't even know the remaster existed.

251
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,549
There's a remaster for Saints Row 3?

252
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:15,569
Is there really?

253
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,569
I didn't know.

254
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,569
Why the fuck would I know this?

255
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,670
Alright, let's go.

256
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,289
What just happened?

257
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,289
Where's my weapon wheel? Give me the weapon wheel.

258
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:57,700
Alright, let's go.

259
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,789
Let's move, move, move.

260
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:11,500
Am I signing an autograph?

261
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,460
Why the hell am I signing an autograph?

262
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,730
Make the head part of your face cam bigger.

263
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,730
No! We're gonna take these masks off in like 10 seconds.

264
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:39,279
Zoom your face in.

265
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,539
Alright, chopper.

266
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:50,099
Now what an idiot. He pressed the alarm button.

267
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:04,569
Now what?

268
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:06,569
Alright, BLS.

269
00:23:06,569 --> 00:23:08,569
Oh, okay, yeah.

270
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,569
What is this? Alright, let's defend.

271
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:12,569
How do I crouch? Left stick, I think, right?

272
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:17,299
Why would you do that?

273
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,859
Why would you do that?

274
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:21,859
This is a huge open area. Why would you do that?

275
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,869
That was completely and absolutely unnecessary.

276
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,869
No reason to do that.

277
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:34,230
But wait, come here.

278
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,250
Come on. I forgot how ugly this game is.

279
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,250
Does this game really actually have a remake?

280
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,730
What was it called?

281
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:53,829
Yes, it does.

282
00:23:53,829 --> 00:24:00,420
What was it called?

283
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
Saints Row the Third Remaster.

284
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,450
It's trash.

285
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:17,430
Oh my god.

286
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,259
Do I even fit in health?

287
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:34,140
The remaster is actually bad.

288
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,089
Is it really?

289
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:50,460
Pick up the shield. I'm out.

290
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,230
I'm out of bullets.

291
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,230
I don't think I can die in this.

292
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,230
I literally can't die. I'm being lit up by a Gatling gun on a helicopter.

293
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,230
Minus two, what?

294
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:07,910
I can't die.

295
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,910
I can't die.

296
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,160
It's just minor graphic improvements.

297
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,880
Germania? What are you talking about?

298
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
I haven't announced any wrestling stuff.

299
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,619
What the fuck are you talking about?

300
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:35,269
Is the game volume too high or too low?

301
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:47,859
Too low.

302
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:51,430
Crank it.

303
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,640
Crank it.

304
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
You would not want to be firing.

305
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,940
What's happening?

306
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:10,900
Better? Alright.

307
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:18,779
Fucking crank it.

308
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:35,099
What?

309
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:39,619
What the fuck is happening?

310
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:47,559
This feels like a mobile game ad.

311
00:26:49,799 --> 00:27:07,059
Crank it.

312
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,430
Not bad.

313
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:20,700
Which by the way, I gotta do the mobile game stream.

314
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I was talking about that for a long time and I never did it.

315
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,769
We gotta do it.

316
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:31,160
We have to do it.

317
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Is it weird that I want to buy a completely new iPad?

318
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,400
Because I feel like it's not going to ever work ever again.

319
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,430
Where we just play all the games that you get ads for.

320
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,430
All the mobile games you get ads for.

321
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,269
Play them all.

322
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:49,269
And spend at least an hour in each one.

323
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,269
Or at least 20 minutes at least in each one.

324
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:57,539
I need to get a burner iPad for that.

325
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:01,769
Get a burner iPad.

326
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:08,420
Just emulate it?

327
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,980
What?

328
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
You can actually emulate it?

329
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:26,009
Alright, there we go.

330
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,009
You can get an Android OS emulator.

331
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:33,299
Really?

332
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,299
I didn't know that. That's cool.

333
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,299
Alright, let's customize the character now.

334
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,730
Here we go.

335
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,210
We're making the McRiddler.

336
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,799
If I can.

337
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,799
That doesn't look old.

338
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,700
That just looks kind of dehydrated.

339
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
This is before the glass of water.

340
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,670
And this is after the glass of water.

341
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,299
Sex appeal?

342
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,299
Okay, that's a dick.

343
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,109
You can just give the guy a huge dick.

344
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:15,109
I thought it was going to make me like handsome.

345
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:17,109
I didn't know that's what that was.

346
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,759
Okay.

347
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,319
That's fine.

348
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,619
Okay.

349
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:30,099
Build.

350
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:34,970
I'm going to try to make the McRiddler if I can.

351
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,970
Can I not?

352
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:53,529
Is there an advanced mode?

353
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,529
Oh yeah, that's right. I used hacks last time.

354
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:57,529
Oh no, I actually used hacks.

355
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,859
Fuck.

356
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,859
I did use hacks last time.

357
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:04,859
Damn it.

358
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:06,859
Oh, I can't do it. I don't have the hacks.

359
00:30:06,859 --> 00:30:17,019
It's alright.

360
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:27,190
How hard is it to get the hacks?

361
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,329
Do they exist?

362
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:38,970
Scroll down on the skins.

363
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:50,299
You can make your guy made out of emerald?

364
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:59,940
I kind of want to do that.

365
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,180
Okay, that's whatever.

366
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,410
I'm going to get so sick of this though.

367
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:10,180
He's a Minecraft diamond.

368
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,130
He's a Minecraft diamond.

369
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,130
That's fucking hilarious.

370
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,809
Minecraft diamond.

371
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:32,809
Without the sliders,

372
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,809
I didn't think they were going to exist for this game.

373
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:41,910
Make him Mr. Emerald.

374
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,910
No, he's Minecraft diamond.

375
00:31:43,910 --> 00:32:05,079
Mr. Green?

376
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,900
No, he's not Mr. Green.

377
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,420
I know what Mr. Green looks like.

378
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,380
I wonder how he's doing.

379
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,140
I wonder if we'll ever see him again.

380
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,880
In person.

381
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,869
I wonder if we'll ever see him

382
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,109
in person doing something.

383
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:33,700
I don't know. Maybe not.

384
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,579
It depends on what Mr. Green is up to.

385
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:42,730
Alright, let's do the ears.

386
00:32:42,730 --> 00:33:05,450
This is just the Silver Surfer.

387
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,670
What did the Silver Surfer do?

388
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,359
What was his thing?

389
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,359
He came in and marked the planets.

390
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,359
For the big guy to eat.

391
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:31,700
Isn't that what it was?

392
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Not wrong? That's what it was, right?

393
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Whoa, what the fuck? I thought I hit accept.

394
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:51,130
My friend Joe is playing

395
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,130
Saints Row 3 right now. Can you say hi to him?

396
00:33:53,130 --> 00:34:03,660
What's up, Joe?

397
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:14,280
This is going to get so irritating. You know what it is.

398
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
I don't know. Why do I feel like this is

399
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
popping up and asking me

400
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
a wish and I said, I want to be the most strong

401
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,280
super powered man in history.

402
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,800
You go like this and I would turn into that.

403
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:38,019
Like this would be what I turned into.

404
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,780
This dude's made out of resin.

405
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Yeah, this guy's just going to lie down

406
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,360
on a wooden table.

407
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Oh nice. Nice, dude.

408
00:34:48,360 --> 00:35:11,460
Whoa, you can put their whole face up

409
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:18,500
or down? Resin.

410
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,980
Don't act like you have not fallen

411
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
asleep to resin poor videos.

412
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,420
Come on, dude. Really?

413
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Don't act like you're better than the rest of us.

414
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:42,219
I want to have a really big mouth.

415
00:35:42,219 --> 00:36:02,809
Okay, I like that better.

416
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:04,809
What's going on with his mouth?

417
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:23,929
Alright, I'm happy with it.

418
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:36,860
Let's suck the chin up though. Let's get like a

419
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:49,340
really fucking big turkey neck.

420
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,090
Alright, I'm happy with it. I'm not happy with the eyes

421
00:36:52,090 --> 00:37:00,329
though. Getting there.

422
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,909
Getting there. Definitely getting there now.

423
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:25,340
I just don't care.

424
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,900
Oh my goodness. Okay.

425
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:39,980
Whoa.

426
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,280
Alright, maybe. Maybe.

427
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:52,519
Yeah, it's Dr. Manhattan's fucking

428
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,460
stepbrother.

429
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:10,119
Resin poor. No, not resin

430
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,119
porn. Resin poor.

431
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:16,860
I don't know if the hair is not doing it for me.

432
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:32,280
That's too easy though.

433
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:48,219
Should I just be bald?

434
00:38:48,219 --> 00:38:52,380
I kind of like this.

435
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:01,340
Should I have like contrasting

436
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,510
hair? Or should I just be

437
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,510
No, not the German colors.

438
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:23,030
I don't know. What do you think? Make it

439
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,300
your hair color. I guess that

440
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,300
is kind of weird. Yeah, it is

441
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
weird. These kind of characters

442
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
never have facial hair.

443
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:40,920
They never have beards, right? Ever.

444
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,380
Can I make? You can't even see it.

445
00:39:44,380 --> 00:40:00,619
I want a big beard.

446
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:03,179
Imagine Dr. Manhattan

447
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:05,670
with a goatee. It just doesn't

448
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,670
fucking work. It does not work.

449
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:23,420
Porn stash. You can't even see

450
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,800
it. Alright, what about if I do this?

451
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,059
I can't even see it. Hold on. This one's the most

452
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:35,059
full, but I need to do it. Okay, can we see it if we

453
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:42,550
change the color?

454
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,550
Doesn't it kind of look like he

455
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:51,849
painted his home with marker? It just

456
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:58,630
looks slightly more oiled.

457
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,630
It's just spray paint. Yeah, it's just spray paint.

458
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,010
Wait. Oh, that one

459
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:11,239
shows up. That looks like shit,

460
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:16,039
though. That looks awful. I

461
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,039
don't like this at all. I really don't like it.

462
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:33,139
I can't even see it. It doesn't matter.

463
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:57,960
You can't see this either.

464
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:18,170
Hold on. I don't hate it.

465
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,619
He looks like a fucking pro wrestler.

466
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:30,519
Turn the reflection off on the skin.

467
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,519
Dude, do you guys really care that much? I'm going to play this

468
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,519
for like five hours and never

469
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:36,699
install it ever again. Does it really matter?

470
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:59,849
Yeah, without, without.

471
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,849
I kind of like the glistening kind of

472
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,849
like car oil.

473
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:20,340
Yeah. Personality.

474
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:32,039
There's a McGriddler. No.

475
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,039
No. Nope. Nope.

476
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:36,039
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

477
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:38,650
Nope. Nope.

478
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,650
No. No. No. Fuck that.

479
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,650
No. It's so easy.

480
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,650
This is the funny thing that everybody does.

481
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,949
This is the funny one.

482
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:51,480
No.

483
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,309
I don't

484
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:01,369
God damn it.

485
00:44:01,369 --> 00:44:08,650
I don't

486
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,019
do it. Can I change it later?

487
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:17,929
Can I go back and change this if I want to?

488
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:23,670
I can. Fine.

489
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:31,610
I hate it already. I do this shit

490
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,869
all the time.

491
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:36,869
I will just be walking around my house and I'll just start

492
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:40,460
doing this. I swear to ask Holly.

493
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,460
I swear to God. Like I

494
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,190
do that. No. Not that.

495
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,789
No. Nope.

496
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:56,550
No. No.

497
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:06,300
I do that too.

498
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:26,889
I do that too.

499
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,059
We're just gonna do that.

500
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,059
I hate this character.

501
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,059
What's this character's name? I forget.

502
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:36,780
Resin? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

503
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,780
wait. I'm excited. Okay. Yeah. This is it, right?

504
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:51,500
Resin table.

505
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,820
Resin four. That's his name.

506
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,820
I'm gonna turn it off now.

507
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,820
It's stupid. It's not even funny.

508
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:02,150
This was funny like 10 years ago.

509
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:08,920
to us. Burke's right. We traded our dicks in for pussies. Seriously, movie deals, commercials.

510
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
This is going to be the every single cutscene.

511
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:22,460
No, it's oh my god. It's always about the money, Mr. Gat, which is precisely why our employer

512
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:33,099
wishes to speak with you. If you'll indulge us. Sounds like you know it actually doesn't.

513
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:50,730
That's a tuber joke. Of course, a remarkable likeness. These visions are viola and kiki

514
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,329
and I am Philippe Laurent, chairman of a multinational organization called the

515
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:56,250
Taz impression.

516
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:22,010
I wonder why my foot's not up your ass at this point. Like it or not, Mr. Gat, our organization is expanding into still water. I am offering you the chance to leverage your assets against your lives. Ladies.

517
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:27,579
Worst dream 2022 because you don't like the zombie voice. Come on, relax.

518
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,579
No, it sucks.

519
00:47:49,769 --> 00:48:00,900
What? No, you're going to get us all sucked out of the plane.

520
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:22,059
I can take them. What about the plane? I'll fly it back to still water.

521
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:32,710
I definitely can't even change it. What a mistake. Details. Details. Just cover the boss. Go. I got this.

522
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:44,150
Yes, that's right. Resin pour. Dr. Manhattan's step brother with the power of costing fifteen thousand dollars.

523
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:54,389
That's it. Attention passengers. This is your new captain speaking. Our updated flight plan has us

524
00:48:54,389 --> 00:49:06,309
landed in still water. I'd like to remind all passengers to remain screen shake. Ah, fuck this fucking screen shake.

525
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:24,139
Here's some relaxing music for your enjoyment. Wait. Oh, let's go do it. There's all this fucking screen shake.

526
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:41,670
Find a parachute. All right, let's go. There's so many people. What are these people doing?

527
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:50,760
This fucking sensitivity is so low. God damn. What the fuck is going on? I don't have any guns.

528
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:21,500
What? Nice Minecraft aim. Dude, I'm. I'm holding. Look, I am holding down right now.

529
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:38,619
Holding up. It's like pitching an airplane. Let's go. Resin hands.

530
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:10,679
I love how he goes off camera for cutscenes like any of us care. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I'm just

531
00:51:10,760 --> 00:52:00,360
used to doing it. What the fuck? This is so stupid. Flip. Flip. Flip. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.

532
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:19,860
How can I go faster? Oh shit. That hurt. Can I get hurt? All right. That hurts. What is going on?

533
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:56,170
Got you. I can't change it. It's over. Oh, man. Why the fuck did I listen to the

534
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:03,480
10 people telling me to do that? What's going on? Do I have to do something?

535
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:40,219
Am I supposed to press a button? Dude, what the fuck? What? That guy's just going to die.

536
00:53:41,880 --> 00:54:00,260
Oh, no, they're not. What is this guy doing? Skip the cutscenes. This whole thing is a cutscene.

537
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:13,699
It's the tutorial at the beginning of the game, man. This is the original, I think. I actually

538
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:17,940
have no idea. I just bought Saints Row the third. That's it. I didn't know anything else.

539
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,900
I wasn't looking for a remaster. I didn't think they were going to remaster this game.

540
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:40,179
We're falling for a really long time. Don't you only really fall when you skydive 30 seconds or

541
00:54:40,179 --> 00:54:58,179
something? Don't you only fall for 20 seconds? No. Three minutes? Why do I feel like

542
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:08,900
you just get sucked to the ground wicked fast? Are you on drugs? How high do you jump out of a plane?

543
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,460
And the Saints are not welcome. When you skydive. I don't know. How high do you go?

544
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:36,780
14,000 feet? And leave them nothing. Not as high as you are right now. I am sober.

545
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:49,619
Sober. Oh, there's a phone. Okay. Stop leaving. We don't care about the cutscenes. Try to skip

546
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:55,980
the cutscenes. But I'm not going to know what's going on. All right, let's go.

547
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:14,630
Steal a car. How do I put the gun away? Don't skip cutscenes.

548
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,219
Steal part. It's kind of like Bangkok's abusive father. Access cell phone map.

549
00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:31,800
Oh my fucking god. Get rid of it now. Okay. So this wants me to go see the GPS. Set the GPS to the

550
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,940
what over here. Okay. Set GPS. Sounds good. Let's go.

551
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,539
I feel like that should not have. Look, where the fuck are we going?

552
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,900
What the fuck? That wasn't even a road.

553
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:08,340
It has GPS, right? Check your map. I think you can get Luigi. Okay, you can actually get Luigi.

554
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:17,019
Jump or dive. Yeah, we raid the guard armory. What the fuck was that?

555
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:24,619
You can't be serious. Oh my god. Shut it off. How do I get rid of it?

556
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:32,570
Oh, a shitty idea. I thought this lady farted.

557
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,730
Like I scared the shit out of her.

558
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:50,340
I was like, what? I thought she farted. I really, I honestly thought she farted.

559
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:55,289
I was like, okay, it's like a comedy thing. When you publicize their car, they like shit their

560
00:57:55,289 --> 00:58:02,170
pants. I don't know. I've never played this one. Can you get in trouble in this game?

561
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:26,340
I don't think I can get in trouble. All right, I made it. Go to the plastic surgeon.

562
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,230
All right, we have to get through this tutorial first. Purchase weapon upgrade.

563
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:47,940
Car crash is funny. That, I guess I'll have to buy the upgrade, right? Okay. Level one. Purchase a

564
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:55,780
weapon upgrade. Is there a way to do that? Buy upgrade weapons. This one. Level two.

565
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:10,550
I have a hundred dollars. What? Oh, okay. All right, go to the guard armory.

566
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:31,059
Where's the car? Holy shit. What's sprint? There's money all over the ground. R3 for melee.

567
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:39,530
Like some hellish children's book, the sky has fallen in Steelport.

568
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:46,090
10 people are dead after several cars are running out of the sky, crushing an apartment building in

569
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:53,610
a fiery blaze. Dozens of bodies, along with a number of crates of vehicles, filled the streets nearby.

570
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:11,780
Family guy. Car stereos and sex dolls seems to be... Wait, is that it? I don't have any money.

571
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:26,570
What's on fire? What? That's our car? Is she dead? No, you're fine. I can't lose on the tutorial.

572
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:35,340
We're good. All right, follow me. I didn't want to. I didn't want to do that. I thought I was.

573
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:47,820
Whatever. I'm trying to. How do you sprint? Oh my fucking God. Now what? Left bumper? All right.

574
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:58,679
Do I have enough to change the voice? All right. Change voice. Oh, come on, dude. Really? All right.

575
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:25,539
I know what it looks like now, though. Get off. All right. Get on. Let's move.

576
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,380
How come I can't hear any acceleration sounds? That's what's weird to me.

577
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:44,980
There's no... We're just floating. It's an electric motor. You're so slow. What?

578
01:01:46,219 --> 01:01:50,940
I'm not looking over here anymore because I just drive into shit. Stop. Let me do what I'm going to

579
01:01:50,940 --> 01:02:16,550
do. Okay. Let's go. Don't worry. Pierce has that covered. Kill the guards. Go.

580
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:39,260
Get better aim. Can I fight? I need to... All right. Just get off. I got it. Red barrel. Got it.

581
01:02:39,340 --> 01:03:14,619
I shot up a hundred times. Oh my God. This gun sucks. This gun sucks. Excuse me? All right.

582
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:41,269
Weapons. This gun is awful. This one's not. I'm sorry. I'm keyboard turning right now. I'm sorry.

583
01:03:41,269 --> 01:03:55,670
Holy shit. That was cool. The McShitter.

584
01:03:55,909 --> 01:04:03,900
UAV drone controls over here. It's making me... Is it anybody else getting angry?

585
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:19,559
It's kind of angering, isn't it? Oh my God. There's so many people. What? Do I have a grenade

586
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:32,329
or anything? This is too many people here. Oh my God. There's way too many people.

587
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:52,889
What the fuck? Help. Help. Help. I need to get up. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help. Help.

588
01:04:52,889 --> 01:05:06,139
I'm down. Use the what? Dude, I can't even... No. Half the sound effects are missing.

589
01:05:08,389 --> 01:05:22,489
All right. Where's this thing you're talking about? Did you pirate the game?

590
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:29,940
No. I didn't pirate the goddamn game. Do I just have to hold position?

591
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,980
Something's missing. It's weird. Something is missing from the fucking game.

592
01:05:50,309 --> 01:06:04,230
I'm getting pissed. Oh my fucking God. Why are there a million people in here?

593
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,860
There's no music and I feel like half the sound effects don't work.

594
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:47,269
Buy the remaster. Somebody say the remaster sucks. See, yeah, this wasn't here before.

595
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:05,269
Pull it up. Oh, fuck. It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

596
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:33,050
Oh my fucking God. Holy shit, man. What the fuck is this game?

597
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:01,500
How many people are here? There's too many people here. I just have seen that.

598
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:32,180
Way too many people here witnessed that. I'm trying to kill the helicopters. Nice. Got him.

599
01:08:48,569 --> 01:09:10,630
Not dead. He'll be in a minute. This dude's doing CBD injections anymore. All right. Let's go. Let's

600
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:49,210
go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. This dude's fucking scrunked. There's way too many helicopters flying

601
01:09:49,210 --> 01:10:04,619
too close. I just moaned. I could feel it. I actually, I know I just moaned. I know I did.

602
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:41,060
I did. How many helicopters do we have to shoot at? There's been more helicopters than people.

603
01:10:41,539 --> 01:11:17,319
All right, let's go. Just go play iPad games instead. Dude, you're having the nightmare

604
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:24,899
stream where you expose yourself. We're like, stand up and this is naked. This is shit. This

605
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:30,140
is how it started. Let us take care of business. I'm doing this for Johnny.

606
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:39,539
You're worried about real estate? We have guns. Let's use them.

607
01:11:46,659 --> 01:12:01,529
All right. I got money. Who is he talking to? I'm streaming. I need to quit the game and then

608
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:11,189
disable and enable v-sync in the Nvidia control panel. Stand up. No, I can't. I can't. I can't. I

609
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:21,500
can't do it. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't do it because everyone knows me from here up

610
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:26,180
and I look professional. I look like I'm well done. I look well made. All right.

611
01:12:26,899 --> 01:12:42,220
When I stand up, that illusion goes away because I'm wearing, because I'm wearing the fucking

612
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:48,710
goddamn, I'm wearing the fucking Super Mario pajama pants again. All right.

613
01:12:49,270 --> 01:13:09,659
Is that what you wanted to see? Oh no, it happened. Oh no, it happened.

614
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,989
I have a new chair though. This thing's fucking really good.

615
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,529
This is a Herman Miller chair. They actually, they sent it to me.

616
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:36,279
Oh my God. My whole fucking life is changing. How many unlockables did I get?

617
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:52,859
What? This TF2 stuff in this game? Yeah. There's like 10 different adjustable knobs on this thing.

618
01:13:54,699 --> 01:14:00,699
Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. Okay.

619
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:21,979
Hey. Okay. Enough slices. Don't yell. I'm sorry. All right. Let's go.

620
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:55,180
All right. Weird science. He's got a pirated copy. That's all DLC. Oh, did I buy the DLC pack?

621
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:07,770
All right. Let's go. Game is now open. Really? Is there a casino in this game?

622
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:17,289
All right. Where do I want to go? Where was that? That there it is. It's so far away.

623
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:26,619
Do these exist in all the little sections of the city? There's probably another one over here,

624
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:42,520
right? Unknown. Which one is it? Those that are played this game a lot because these are all

625
01:15:42,520 --> 01:16:01,399
unknown. Bottom one, like right here. I'll check this one. That one. Go to the strip club.

626
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:22,069
Why would you do that? All right. That's a gun place. Is it this one? Check this one too.

627
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:32,840
The top center. I thought you guys said it was the bottom one.

628
01:16:42,949 --> 01:16:48,260
Nope. Car place. Whatever. I'm sure I'll get up there eventually.

629
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:56,550
Go to the strip club and turn on face cam.

630
01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:02,149
With your steel board breaking news. What? That's basically why would it mean to turn on the face

631
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:24,739
cam? Stronger. You said you needed me. All right. So what's this one? Do the ipads for the ipads

632
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:39,449
room is going to take a while to set up. I got to get like 50 games. This is DLC. Oh, only do face cam.

633
01:17:39,449 --> 01:17:56,250
I see they failed you Johnny. Never will. Number one fan for months. I've been cut sunglasses.

634
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:05,100
I thought I had had enough things that he touched.

635
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:31,220
He's trying to make a clone. You cloned Gat? Yeah. That just took me by surprise. I forgot

636
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,420
that was a person in the game. I was like, who the fuck is that guy?

637
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:27,800
Okay. Robot chicken. Do I have enough firepower to do this? Hey, hey, hey.

638
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:33,239
Hey, slow down. Yeah, but you knew we had to take on the center.

639
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:40,039
A clone of Gat ain't gonna know that. Is it like a giant version of? Okay.

640
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:52,409
Change the voice? I mean, I'm so far away from it.

641
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:02,819
Okay. The next time I come across one, I will change it. I promise.

642
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:32,060
Do you look crusty today? I'd rather be fucking crusty than soggy and like wilted.

643
01:20:46,579 --> 01:21:09,159
All right. So where is he? Oh, he's narrating this whole thing.

644
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:19,859
Interrogate. Oh, get in. All right. Come here. How do I interrogate?

645
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:30,630
What the hell do you want? Is your favorite food chicken? Oh, that's one of them.

646
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:39,369
Better find Gat before these guys do. I was like, why did my voice change?

647
01:21:43,819 --> 01:21:47,300
I thought that was me talking. Okay.

648
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:18,699
Why am I still holding this person? Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

649
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:48,229
All right, let's go. I feel like I'm watching someone else watch someone play this game.

650
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:53,350
Why? This is like a weird feeling I'm having. I feel like I'm not playing. I'm like watching

651
01:22:53,350 --> 01:23:00,119
someone else play. Does that make any sense? I don't know what it is with this game.

652
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:05,819
Why Saints Row 3? I didn't feel that way in Saints Row 2. I think I'm watching someone play the game.

653
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:23,159
Oh, no. I'm just saying it's like, I feel like I haven't played the game yet. Does that make

654
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:51,449
any sense? It's probably the camera. It's not the camera shake. I can't lose. All right. Where is he?

655
01:23:56,729 --> 01:24:00,329
Screaming his name and something about stripper poles and then started

656
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:12,039
trashing the place. People panicked and he ran off. Okay. Why don't, what are you, what?

657
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:19,079
We were not supposed to kill him. All right. What is going on here? Get the fuck away from me.

658
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:35,369
Get this guy. I thought we were supposed to kill this guy. I didn't do that. Okay.

659
01:24:35,369 --> 01:25:10,380
Okay. Grenade. Grenade out. Oh, be careful. I love the crow hop. This is DLC.

660
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:34,069
Okay. Somebody said, dude, I wish somebody in chat would let me know if this was DLC or not.

661
01:25:34,069 --> 01:26:05,340
Okay. Where's Jimmy? All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's get out. Out, out, out. Turn around,

662
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:29,880
turn around. Get behind me. Shoot, shoot. All right. Let's go.

663
01:26:45,029 --> 01:26:58,069
What the fuck are you doing? Hey, dude. Come on, man. When the fucking Uber pulls up,

664
01:26:58,069 --> 01:27:02,869
you don't, come on. Don't, don't, now don't text me and say, hey, where are you, man? I'm looking

665
01:27:02,949 --> 01:27:08,229
for you. You drove right by me. I have the GPS thing right there. I'm not, I don't want to walk

666
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:22,539
a half mile to go find you now. Oh, this is a rocket launcher. All right. What is this person

667
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:40,470
doing? I don't have to even shoot at them. They're just going to, what is it? Is it a monster?

668
01:27:41,350 --> 01:28:01,140
What the fuck was that? I thought he was going to be way bigger. Is it weird that I'm not intimidated

669
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:15,670
at all? I thought he was going to be five times bigger. Protect the car. All right.

670
01:28:16,229 --> 01:29:30,310
Discovering shortcuts, update your GPS. Okay. Oh, stop, stop. What, what, what? There's too many

671
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:53,369
rockets. This game feels like a fever dream. I'll tell you, I feel like I haven't played the game.

672
01:29:54,090 --> 01:30:10,380
Am I out of ammo? No. I feel like somebody is describing Saints Row 3 to me right now.

673
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:15,659
And I'm like imagining what you're describing. Like I'm sitting there listening to you be like,

674
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:18,779
yeah, man, so we're in the car. Uh, one of the missions you drive around and shoot the rocket

675
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:21,579
launcher and stuff. It's fucking Saints Row. And I'm just sitting there going, okay, I'm picturing

676
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:54,659
that what that is. Don't play the deal. Well, this was in the beginning of the game too. I feel like

677
01:30:54,659 --> 01:31:08,859
I've been hanging out of a window for an hour, an hour and 20 minutes. Oh, this car is going to

678
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:24,920
explode. There's so many things. What the fuck is happening, man? No, no, this is the real long play

679
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:28,520
that the world is doing to me right now. See, I'm going to wake up. I'm going to wake up and I'm

680
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,600
going to be in the chair and I'm going to have the controller in my hand. I'm going to be playing

681
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,760
Saints Row 3. Be like, oh shit. Oh my God. Okay. No, I was, I was sleeping. I was asleep. I was

682
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:39,659
weird. What a weird dream. I'm going to look down and then my dick is going to be out. I'm going to

683
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:44,279
be like, what the fuck? No, no, no, no, no, this can't be real. And I'm going to look over a chat

684
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:51,960
and everyone's going to be screaming that I did it. This was the long dream. This was the long con

685
01:31:51,960 --> 01:32:13,100
that my dream was pulling. Do you imagine me just sitting here sleeping? I'm just sitting here like,

686
01:32:15,289 --> 01:32:21,479
but that means I would have had to have turned the stream on, right? Wait, did I not? What about the,

687
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:44,149
I got a lot of money. Okay. I got money. Let's get health regen. Let's do abilities,

688
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:58,699
do welding, notoriety. I like that. We'll do sprint. These all cost money. Okay. Hold on.

689
01:32:58,699 --> 01:33:13,880
I got two grand. Okay. So missions. So this, so this is DLC, right? So which one of these is just

690
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:29,020
story mission? Go to your weapons and outfits. This is like a garage. Okay. So it's all DLC.

691
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:43,619
All right. So, so I just want to do like the next mission. Okay. Wardrobe. Oh my God.

692
01:33:44,260 --> 01:34:18,409
It'll be Darth Vader. Oh my God. I, this one's great. I'll put the heavy mask on only for a

693
01:34:18,409 --> 01:35:06,859
little bit though. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Do I get cars? What the hell? What? I just

694
01:35:06,859 --> 01:35:22,119
get this at the beginning. Oh my God. Really? All right. Well, I want this thing. Chainstay. All

695
01:35:22,119 --> 01:35:30,869
right. So now let's go. I look like one of the worms from like Worms Armageddon. Gang operations.

696
01:35:34,300 --> 01:36:00,390
Oh shit. Do I have a grenade? This is the fucking dickhead that just sits over here that you find

697
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:07,260
in the online game and he's dressed like this. He has like $500 worth of in-game currency

698
01:36:07,899 --> 01:36:26,470
and you can't even hurt this guy. Oh shit. Somebody got to him. GTA hacker.

699
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:33,579
You know, like a UFO is just going to spawn up there. What? I just got on it.

700
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:46,600
What the hell is going on? Um, okay. Why is this fucking Fortnite? What's going on here?

701
01:36:46,600 --> 01:37:00,550
Fuck is going on? What? Why does this person have this ultra move? You got to keep up grandpa.

702
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:13,140
Now this is, this is where this guy goes. Fucking goddamn online store. 500 gems. 29.99. Checkout.

703
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:22,010
Checkout. Password. Accepted. Thank you. Your purchase is complete. Ammo. Guns. Rocket launcher.

704
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:56,359
Full ammo. All right. I want to, let's, let's do something. That's John from Delocated. That's

705
01:37:56,359 --> 01:38:08,630
John from Delocated. It really is. That's what that was. That was, that was a blast from the past.

706
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:15,859
Holy shit. All right. So where do I go? What should I do? Should I pick up one of these missions?

707
01:38:15,859 --> 01:38:30,619
How about, uh, all of these DLC? The top is the mission. Okay. Let's do this one. Your character

708
01:38:30,619 --> 01:38:42,569
is looking thick. Why is the helmet coming off? Why was that so brutal for that one guy?

709
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:47,619
That was unnecessary.

710
01:38:54,710 --> 01:39:06,039
I know about the, I know I got to change the voice. Okay. Look, it's taking me over here.

711
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:15,939
Is there one on the way? Is this one? Is this it right here? Or is there one closer? I don't think

712
01:39:15,939 --> 01:39:31,670
there's one closer. Let's go to this one. I feel like it's probably this one. Let's move. I was

713
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:39,539
not gonna, I was just not gonna stop. I don't, I didn't care. I was not stopping. Holding the brake

714
01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:55,850
was going to be too hard. Too much shit. It was, I was too lazy to. All right. So what is, what's up?

715
01:39:56,409 --> 01:40:23,909
This is not, this is not one either. Really? Come on. This one, just go west. I mean, this is the

716
01:40:23,909 --> 01:40:32,170
only one I haven't seen. I'll try this one. This one's close. I need a new car though. This thing's

717
01:40:32,170 --> 01:41:06,460
annoying. Watch out. What's the horn? Sprint and steal to get in faster. Oh, that's true.

718
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:13,560
You're right. Does this say anything? All right. I'm getting, everyone's, I'm just getting lied to

719
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:27,100
over and over again. I just, I'm just going to go to the mission. Everyone said that one, that one,

720
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:30,380
that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one. That's probably like two in

721
01:41:30,380 --> 01:42:12,460
the whole map. What a smooth ride. I found one. I didn't want to shoot the gun. I wanted to punch

722
01:42:12,460 --> 01:43:02,279
him. Okay. Voice. Here we go. Yes. We're doing one. Okay. Now everybody will be happy. Why not

723
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:05,960
three? Cause three is the McGriddler. That's not, I'm not the McGriddler right now. I'm with resin

724
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:22,739
pour. Somebody give me a car. Okay. Thank you. That'd be so fucked up. Do you imagine seeing

725
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:43,079
that? If you watch that happen, it's like, Hey, why? Whoa. That is gone already. All right. Let's

726
01:43:43,079 --> 01:43:52,220
do it. Mission time. Oh, right. The title says McGriddler. It's not even accurate. Let's go to

727
01:43:52,220 --> 01:44:13,210
tune it. Let's find a real asshole. All right. We're going to get this tuned up. Shani's taking

728
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:18,789
this thing. We can't stop. Don't cut me off. We all are, but you're always pissed off. The girl's

729
01:44:18,789 --> 01:44:30,979
not as crazy as you. Don't worry. Keep an eye on it. Long time. He was there when I first joined

730
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:37,220
the saints. He click baited us. He mellowed with age. Somebody called it too. You really did.

731
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:41,619
Somebody in prestream said he's going to get to the character creator. Something's going to make

732
01:44:41,619 --> 01:44:45,859
him laugh and he's going to change everything. And I said, no way that happens. You were right.

733
01:44:45,859 --> 01:45:05,109
You were completely right. Yeah. Yeah. You actually got it. Correct. Minecraft David.

734
01:45:06,859 --> 01:45:11,979
That was a good idea, but that was too funny. Come on. Like the guy lies on a lying on the

735
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:19,350
table on a wooden table. Resin guy joke. I had to do it. I had to. I had to. I don't want to

736
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:29,539
level up this car. This guy sucks. That's all I'm doing. Got some more style. Now it's our turn.

737
01:45:29,539 --> 01:45:33,220
Hey, the planet saints. I don't know, man. That's like wearing the band's t-shirt to the concert.

738
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:36,310
Nothing wrong with wanting to look. I always look good.

739
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:58,659
Okay. Go to planet. Planet saints. Turn cruise control off to hear the engine. To the streets.

740
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:06,180
Got me up the cigarette. Is that zip? She's on my feet. To find a reason.

741
01:46:06,979 --> 01:46:13,939
Reason things went wrong. Got to find a reason why my money's all gone. Oh,

742
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:23,689
no. I could still get high and I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot.

743
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:33,529
Yeah. I like this game. You didn't shut up. I do it because I'm the one that can sing in this group.

744
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:39,449
Life is what you got. Well, you might get run over or you might get shot.

745
01:46:41,529 --> 01:47:00,439
Everyone stop doing this. I'm the singer of the group. That's what I got.

746
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:17,000
Oh shit. You hit a lady. You hit a lady. You hit a lady. Holy fuck. Oppress that person.

747
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:27,180
Get that person. He needs to be under arrest. All right. Let's go. What's happening? What am I

748
01:47:27,180 --> 01:48:02,010
doing right now? No. Wait. Give me the engineer head. What's the other? What's the color? What's

749
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:19,979
the colors for the engineer? It's that. It's brown, right? Yeah. That was correct. Okay. Good. Yep.

750
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:56,149
And then we need the engineer head. A light. All right. What about gloves? He's got gloves,

751
01:48:56,149 --> 01:49:07,770
right? They're the big bright yellow, right? Yeah. They're huge. Here we go. I don't even need to

752
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:19,399
change color. They are. No, they're not quite yellow. They're there. That's a pretty, that's

753
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:40,859
pretty close. This is bad. This is good enough. Who the fuck is this? Is that thing something

754
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:52,119
pissed off? Okay. I'm an engineer, but that means I solve problems. I solve practical problems

755
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:03,739
like this. I'm doing my routine. Stop. If that don't work, use a gun. If that don't work,

756
01:50:05,819 --> 01:50:34,199
use more guns. Did I win? I got it. I want to queue up. Why am I shooting at these people?

757
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:43,399
I want to queue up the TF2 theme song, but alt tabbing this game will break it.

758
01:50:53,270 --> 01:51:14,760
Are these people? This is wrong. I don't know what's happening. Hey, look, bud.

759
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,949
I'm going to do it because why the fuck not? I'm having fun today.

760
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:27,500
We're just having fun today, you know?

761
01:51:27,500 --> 01:52:32,630
Oh shit. Get him. I'm an engineer. Was that me? Where's the safe house?

762
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:42,569
No, no, no. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. Put it

763
01:52:42,569 --> 01:53:13,109
down. Put it down. This is a 2013 video you made. True. True. Where's the fucking safe house?

764
01:53:13,989 --> 01:53:23,529
What? Abandoning who? Where is he?

765
01:53:56,859 --> 01:54:07,060
Save your game. Oh my God. You're right. What am I? Clothes change. Oh, nope. That's my friend.

766
01:54:07,779 --> 01:54:23,750
Throwing grenades. Get in the safe house. I don't need to kill everybody. Get in the safe house,

767
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:52,779
please. All right. We're safe. Get in here. I'm in the safe house, right? Oh, there we go.

768
01:54:52,779 --> 01:55:14,329
What about autoplay? It's not a six grand. I'll take it. Hey, look, bud. Okay. Well, if we're

769
01:55:14,329 --> 01:55:18,779
going to do this joke, we need to do it with other characters too, because that's what I want to do

770
01:55:18,779 --> 01:55:48,649
today. So that's what we're doing. That's just what's happening. So close, right? How do I change

771
01:55:48,649 --> 01:56:01,000
the color? He has underwear with a big dick. All right. I gotta go back to the store.

772
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:34,460
New missions available. Cool. Party time. I need to put that backpack on too. Save the game. Yep.

773
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:46,729
Yep. Mission checkpoints are not saved. That doesn't matter. Okay. We're good. Okay. Let's go to

774
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:55,670
tattoo parlor. Yeah. I need to buy that backpack. All right. There's probably a closed store

775
01:56:55,989 --> 01:56:59,819
where I'm going, right? There is. There's one on the way. We'll go to this one here.

776
01:56:59,819 --> 01:57:08,100
And the real estate agent will be there, right? Real funny. Oh, that's a nice car.

777
01:57:10,250 --> 01:57:16,970
It's not the one I wanted, but whatever. What's the plan? I want, I want the car in front of me.

778
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:29,850
The nice one, the one, whatever. Now I'm not going to get it. Right. Pen houses. Psychos. Yeah. I'll

779
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:49,399
take this one. What's wrong with this car? What's wrong with this car? The tires look fine. There's

780
01:57:49,399 --> 01:58:14,199
no body damage. What's the problem? I'm not breaking there. We're good. Stop using both feet.

781
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:21,930
Like I'm pressing down both feet onto the, yeah, it's turbo power. That's how you go faster. You

782
01:58:21,930 --> 01:59:14,020
can double the gas. I need to, this is going to kill me. Okay. We're good. Sorry. Okay. I need to

783
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:30,140
change the colors on this to red and white outfits. Okay. Here we go. What color was this? It was

784
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:39,619
not this color, but red. If I'm on red team, it was always gray. That's right. It was gray.

785
01:59:47,739 --> 02:00:32,920
That's fine. Okay. Upper body. Where's the thing I'm currently wearing outfits. It's coming up here.

786
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:54,119
Right. Where is it? No, it's the thing I have on right now. What's it called? Now there it is. I

787
02:00:54,119 --> 02:01:05,079
don't want the witch hat though. How do I change the colors? How do I change colors? I don't want

788
02:01:05,079 --> 02:01:21,979
the hat. Okay. So it's what? Whoa. Yeah. It's white and red. We'll have this just blend in

789
02:01:23,239 --> 02:01:45,340
and then red gloves. Okay. Yeah. Big red gloves. They're huge. What's the biggest ones they got?

790
02:01:45,340 --> 02:02:03,140
These are pretty big. Okay. And then his pants, uh, they're kind of maroon. It's kind of like this.

791
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:14,619
They're like slacks. Yeah. They're like, kind of like this. It's like a dark, like a brown.

792
02:02:14,619 --> 02:02:34,649
It's like just kind of brownish. That's close enough. Okay. What about the shoes? Boots?

793
02:02:34,649 --> 02:02:57,159
They're just black boots. But everything's fine. They're, they're not, they're kind of,

794
02:02:57,159 --> 02:03:09,670
I'll just make them. It's all right. It's making black. All right. Here we go. I made the medic.

795
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:44,380
I'm good to go. Hey, there we are. Medic. I thought the game just crashed. Holy shit. Why is

796
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:56,920
that person on the ground? Emerald skin. All right. Let's do the mission and I will put on.

797
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:09,989
Yes. Well, this is what's keeping us active today. So I put on voice lines to just put on the

798
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:17,140
sound effects. Okay. I'm going to put on, I'm going to drop all the sound effects in the game,

799
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:22,890
every sound effect in this game. And I'm going to put on like gameplay, no commentary, an hour on

800
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:27,859
dust bowl, put that on in the background, put the music in the background, and then put a bunch of

801
02:04:27,859 --> 02:04:36,060
medic, uh, voice lines. I've just been to play. I think that's what I want to do. Do you remember

802
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:48,170
why? How come you're not eating pirate's booty on stream? Why would I be doing that? The mods

803
02:04:48,170 --> 02:04:58,409
are just on top of it. This is great. All right. I, I'm going to tell you, this is my first,

804
02:04:58,409 --> 02:05:09,260
this is my first day sitting in this new chair. This is way better than the thing I had before.

805
02:05:11,939 --> 02:05:22,920
All right. So this, so this chair, you can turn a knob and it like, it pushes the kind of spine

806
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:31,779
support thing into your back. It just like kind of wedges you in. Yeah. It's Herman Miller. I'm not

807
02:05:31,859 --> 02:05:37,850
sponsoring anything. They, I just was in the market for a new chair. And I mean, I guess you

808
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:43,850
could say this is, I mean, if you want to call it a sponsorship, it wasn't paid to say anything

809
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:57,100
about it, but I think I got a chair. So that's fucking cool. So yeah, this was, this chair was

810
02:05:57,100 --> 02:06:02,539
provided to me by Herman Miller. If you want me to say that, right. That's kind of what I should be

811
02:06:02,539 --> 02:06:16,470
saying, but it's fucking awesome. They are expensive, but I mean,

812
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:33,100
you should review cigarettes. They are very, very expensive. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

813
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:40,140
no. We're not doing that song. I don't know. We're doing the TF tooth joke. Will that work

814
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:56,170
here? This is going to fall so flat, I think, but whatever. How flat do you think this is going to

815
02:06:56,170 --> 02:07:06,869
be? Let's find out. Okay. Red medic dust ball gameplay. No commentary. Medic voice lines.

816
02:07:06,869 --> 02:07:22,710
That's just everything here. Let's get it ready. How's that? This is fucking stupid.

817
02:07:42,819 --> 02:07:43,699
Please.

818
02:08:58,470 --> 02:09:05,930
He keeps talking. What? It's a spy.

819
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:31,020
Everyone's a spy.

820
02:10:33,079 --> 02:11:01,529
Okay, I can't fucking do it anymore. It's too much.

821
02:11:04,489 --> 02:11:13,529
Oh, okay.

822
02:11:23,449 --> 02:11:29,050
That's enough. I think my chest hurts. When he's talking about his head,

823
02:11:29,850 --> 02:11:33,210
push, help me push the point. Oh my God. That's so fucking funny.

824
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:44,180
Okay. Well, let's get back to this. Yeah. I know can't for that one that the,

825
02:11:44,180 --> 02:12:04,920
I think the bit needs to play out my head, my head. Okay. This is okay. Now this is like,

826
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:16,630
this is like strange to me now. This is, isn't this a weird now? I feel like I did. I did. I

827
02:12:16,630 --> 02:12:48,489
put on another song. Whatever. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go. Quick.

828
02:12:57,100 --> 02:13:06,100
What am I doing? What the fuck did I do that for? I don't know why I did that. I started

829
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:18,300
coughing and just did it. My head, my head. Okay. We're good. Back to it.

830
02:13:26,539 --> 02:13:35,979
We need to start Dustbowl again. What a fucking amazing game. It's so good. It's so good.

831
02:13:36,699 --> 02:13:41,180
Right? You know what I mean? They'll never be another team fortress ever. It's impossible.

832
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:45,579
You know what I think? Here, I can give you a take here. Everybody that thinks that the,

833
02:13:45,579 --> 02:13:49,260
oh my God, half-life, half-life, half-life, half-life, half-life. It's going to be so hard

834
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:54,779
to make another half-life. No, no, absolutely. Team Fortress 2, they'll like, they'll be,

835
02:13:54,779 --> 02:14:00,539
never be another TF2. It'll be impossible to make TF3. I feel strongly about that versus

836
02:14:00,539 --> 02:14:05,579
Half-Life 3. I think they could do a Half-Life 3 and be fine. I don't think they could do a TF3.

837
02:14:06,699 --> 02:14:19,210
That game was perfect. It was perfect. It was a perfect video game. So now I'm more afraid about

838
02:14:19,210 --> 02:14:26,329
them trying to do TF3 if they ever decide to, right? I mean, what is going on right now?

839
02:14:26,970 --> 02:14:38,409
There's a bass high take. There's the characters, the voice work. It was like this whole world that

840
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:42,729
they created and they didn't have to do anything. You know what the craziest part about TF2 really

841
02:14:42,729 --> 02:14:49,960
was? There was this overarching kind of storyline, right? But it really lived in the background

842
02:14:51,159 --> 02:14:57,640
and the characters made everything. The characterization of the classes made the,

843
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:03,880
you kind of got to, hold on, sorry. I'm like, I hear like music. It's like the characters were

844
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:09,479
the whole thing. You didn't even need a story. And there was just enough overarching stuff in

845
02:15:09,479 --> 02:15:17,609
the background that made it perfect. If I could, okay, okay. I got three wishes. If a Genie came

846
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:22,890
in front of me and was like, hello, Charma. Good to see you. I'm the Genie and you have three wishes.

847
02:15:23,529 --> 02:15:28,649
I would, okay, here's what I'd wish for. I'd wish for like literally world peace and world hunger.

848
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:34,250
And make Team Fortress 3 as good as TF2. There you go. Those are my three wishes.

849
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:35,770
And by the way, release it in like six months.

850
02:15:58,439 --> 02:16:07,289
What the fuck? Where are they? I didn't, look, I'm sorry.

851
02:16:20,979 --> 02:16:51,690
You should wish for more stuff. You can't wish for more wishes. Let's go. Follow what? Did I fail?

852
02:16:52,809 --> 02:16:56,489
No, okay, we're good. I failed? What happened? What the fuck just happened?

853
02:16:59,139 --> 02:17:17,850
What? Oh my God. I can't do a cool action jump. It hurts so bad. All right, go, go, go, go, go, go,

854
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:52,649
go. Am I calling somebody? Crash your helicopter into him. I thought about it,

855
02:17:52,649 --> 02:18:20,340
but I don't think I can reach him. Oh shit. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I don't care.

856
02:18:21,479 --> 02:18:29,510
I don't care. I don't care. Whatever. Everyone's yelling at me. God, yell at me. I don't care.

857
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:38,920
I don't care. It's fine. I don't care. No, I don't care. I don't care. People are like,

858
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:58,620
oh my God, he must care. I don't care at all. I don't care. Go. All right. Don't be an idiot.

859
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:06,569
I'm just a full throttle. Okay. Now I feel like I'm playing the game, right? Like the last 45

860
02:19:06,569 --> 02:20:26,120
minutes. What are you talking about? I didn't care. Whoa. Shooting shit at me. Okay. So let's go.

861
02:20:30,739 --> 02:21:14,389
He crashed. What? Do I have to land? I'm okay. Come here. Red wire. Whoa. Somebody's phone's

862
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:29,989
ringing. Let's fire the gun. Did I lose? Oh, not again. The saints aren't going to back down.

863
02:21:31,030 --> 02:21:36,549
Maddie, there's nothing to worry about. My thoughts exactly, Mr. Kilbane. The saints

864
02:21:36,549 --> 02:21:52,010
are no more than a white noise of empty sights. With respect, sir, I'd say empty is no longer

865
02:21:52,010 --> 02:22:04,790
applicable. I forgot that it's in the cut scenes. I completely glazed over that.

866
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:35,659
Max a fucking psycho. Sound of progress, my friend. Oh, I own this place now. Okay.

867
02:22:36,219 --> 02:22:49,739
A stun gun. Can we, wait a minute. What the saints wear, what vehicles they drive and their taunts.

868
02:22:51,659 --> 02:22:59,930
Are you telling me that I can make a full Team Fortress 2 gang? Do you not even talk? Please

869
02:22:59,930 --> 02:23:02,969
don't tell me that because that's all I care about for the rest of the whole day.

870
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:27,750
Well, how do I do that? Where do I do that? It's only pre-made costumes? Oh, okay. All right.

871
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:55,379
Access the crib. Let's find out. Wardrobe. Okay. Gang. Style. Okay. Oh, no, you can't.

872
02:23:58,180 --> 02:24:09,579
No, it's all right. You can't. Oh, well. Oh, well. Oh, well. Okay. It's all right.

873
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:17,739
I mean, everyone's going to get the dumper though. That's very important. What about their car?

874
02:24:22,979 --> 02:24:45,659
Yep. Yep. Yeah. Maybe I should upgrade some guns. All right. Damage. Bullet damage. I mean,

875
02:24:45,659 --> 02:24:52,069
why not? 5% reduction in damage taken from bullets. 10% reduction in damage when hit by a vehicle.

876
02:24:53,110 --> 02:25:07,079
I got 14 grand. Oh, explosive ammo. Carried 25% more grenades. Yeah. More pistol ammo. More

877
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:18,180
shotgun. More SMG. Mailing enemies throws them slightly further. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Don't spend

878
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:30,120
all my money. Bonuses. Hourly city income. 500 bucks. Yeah, I'll take it. Pay cash for 4,000

879
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:44,409
respect. Okay. Gang abilities. Vehicle delivery. Yep. I like that. You should do mods. Maybe I'll

880
02:25:44,409 --> 02:25:51,940
do like an insane mod day. You know, yeah, let's write that down. I'm going to do just a wacky mod

881
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:58,500
day where I pick up a few games that have just never ending mods and just ruin them and play

882
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:04,500
like three or four games. Because, okay, here's the problem. Once you start turning on mods that

883
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:09,299
are crazy, you're not the games over. You're not playing the game anymore. There's no going back

884
02:26:09,299 --> 02:26:12,500
to like, oh, I'm going to use the pistol and go to do the mission. It's not going to happen anymore.

885
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:16,760
So you got to give yourself like an hour or two to play in the mod playground and then move on.

886
02:26:19,799 --> 02:26:31,270
So that we'll do it. We'll do a we'll do a cookie mod night. We'll do it soon. Can I parachute off

887
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:54,809
this? All right. That's pretty cool. Answer cell phone. You're attacking our grip. All right. You

888
02:26:54,809 --> 02:27:14,219
got it. I'm on my way. I didn't even see that. Wait, they're up here. Recreational drugs and

889
02:27:14,219 --> 02:27:21,420
numerous hookers. Now gunfights can be added to that list. Shots were fired in a downtown penthouse

890
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:31,260
apartment resulting in several deaths. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my God. Give me the car.

891
02:27:36,059 --> 02:28:18,940
Did you actually get in the car? What's up? Put her down. Put her down. Put her down. Put her down.

892
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:31,000
Put her down. Get out. Get out. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why?

893
02:28:31,159 --> 02:29:18,250
Why? Oh shit. Go. All right. I did the mission, right? We're good. All right. Cool. New mission.

894
02:29:18,250 --> 02:29:22,739
What am I going to do? What am I going to do next? Guardian angel. Let's do this one.

895
02:29:22,739 --> 02:29:30,200
Let's go to the HQ. Hey, I think I'm ready to make a move on the syndicate. What you got in mind?

896
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:34,489
Get to the crib. You see, this better be worth my time. I said this is boring. I want to watch

897
02:29:34,489 --> 02:29:54,469
you gamble. Oh, I mean, I know a guy that does a lot of gambling. I've got to know him a little

898
02:29:54,469 --> 02:30:26,360
bit over the last few years. Yeah. OK, let's do it. Check it out, boss. What's up? Since this

899
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:31,079
used to be a syndicate crib, but I poke around and see what they left behind. No one's getting

900
02:30:31,079 --> 02:30:38,360
any more hints. Now shut up. The syndicate will know we have the keys. They'll be waiting for us

901
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:42,840
to make a move. I guess then you better watch my back. All right, let's go.

902
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:51,770
Oh, hanging out of the fucking chopper, shooting grenades at people, hanging out of the side of a

903
02:30:51,770 --> 02:31:33,739
fucking window. Why do I have control for that? Just keeping you on your toes. Stop driving into

904
02:31:33,739 --> 02:32:13,059
my missiles. I can't even aim that far. I can't aim that far. Air shot. I got it. I actually got

905
02:32:13,059 --> 02:32:39,000
it. How do I heal your car? Well, drive by them. Your car is fucked up, man. They're blocking the

906
02:32:39,000 --> 02:33:07,899
road up here. Help me out. Where? Well, I stopped flying the helicopter so far. You idiot. I'm going,

907
02:33:07,899 --> 02:33:52,329
Mouse, for this. Your sensitivity is so high. You haven't been touched once. Relax. Come on, move.

908
02:34:32,459 --> 02:34:58,459
Help me out. Stop hiding behind the car. It's just over the bridge. I'll find a place to set up.

909
02:35:05,319 --> 02:36:07,819
Oh, right in the middle. What? Why would you pull up that close? Oh shit, they got

910
02:36:21,620 --> 02:37:02,059
this. I think his mate saw me. Yes. Yes, he did. Oh, we're in a Team Fortress 2 movie today, huh?

911
02:37:10,870 --> 02:37:29,299
Only two grand for that? What the hell? That's kind of bullshit if you ask me. $82 per hour.

912
02:37:29,299 --> 02:37:45,100
Oh, this is... I don't want to do this again. Jeremy, you're good at sniping? Just wait till you see my raw

913
02:37:45,100 --> 02:38:01,159
snipes and the fucking misgive $100,000 smite tournament on the 27th. What happened over here?

914
02:38:01,159 --> 02:38:31,690
What are these people doing? What's wrong with you? Oops. All right, mission. Let's go. This one.

915
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:52,420
So you're saying it has to be me. Oh, I'll do the selling. You just get my back and I have the

916
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:59,930
perfect places to hit. I thought you weren't going to play smite anymore. I didn't say that.

917
02:39:05,559 --> 02:39:15,899
I didn't say that. When did I say that? You literally did. What are you talking? So how

918
02:39:15,899 --> 02:39:19,579
do we know where to sell? Let's cut right to the heart of this shit and hit the Morningstar

919
02:39:19,579 --> 02:39:23,420
territory. How do you know where that is? The documents we got with those keys gave up a whole

920
02:39:23,420 --> 02:39:34,870
lot. Smite Thursdays. I like it. What sort of things we have to sell off? I'm driving? No,

921
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:44,469
he's driving. So we have a bunch of shit drove into a tree as fast as they could. Why?

922
02:40:03,959 --> 02:40:15,819
All right, let's get the deal done. Protect the dealer and the buyer. You got it.

923
02:40:16,299 --> 02:40:28,680
This saint's biography is signed by the whole crew. Give me some pickles and I'll wear anything.

924
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:50,459
Protected. Let's go. Shoot this fucking guy, please. All right, let's go. New deal. Yeah.

925
02:40:50,459 --> 02:41:05,399
Hold the gun to their head. I don't think that'll work. I'm not driving the car. This car has beat

926
02:41:05,399 --> 02:41:25,000
the fuck up bad. Will you just stop already? Finally. That's another deal. Something wrong

927
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:39,770
with your eyes. You get out of the car. Haha. Stupid. Don't fuck with the saints. It just

928
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:51,670
in these universes, I would never want to walk anywhere. It's just driving into people like I'm

929
02:41:51,670 --> 02:42:03,110
not going to. I'm literally not going anywhere. I got to go over there. Oh, he left without paying.

930
02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:22,489
Did we get him? These people are fucking pissing me off. Did I just make them so angry? Wait,

931
02:42:25,049 --> 02:43:06,299
you fucking idiot. You're going to drown them? All right, let's go. All right, take their car.

932
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:21,770
Haha. Drive. Get us out of here. What are you doing? Where is he going? You're going to get

933
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:53,670
into melee range. Where is he going? Oh my goodness. I snapped his neck. This is fucking brutal.

934
02:43:55,479 --> 02:44:07,399
Can we can we leave? Can we leave? Just get in the car and let's leave. Okay. I pissed these people

935
02:44:07,399 --> 02:44:14,500
off so bad. They're never going to leave me alone. They're never going to leave me alone.

936
02:44:15,219 --> 02:44:50,940
Is there a reason why you're going 20? You good? I'm just like, I don't even want to be here.

937
02:44:59,209 --> 02:45:14,680
Two grand. Let's go. Six respect. Pretty good. Ban the spammers. Ban the spammers. Ban the spammers.

938
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:34,420
Ban the spammers. What's next? All right, now let's take over the city. You want to rob some

939
02:45:34,420 --> 02:45:42,059
store? That'll cause more problems than because they'll jump at the chance to sell to us. Nope,

940
02:45:42,059 --> 02:45:50,360
because we already have come again. We take the deed from the lock box. They can't argue.

941
02:45:55,059 --> 02:46:01,420
Call the banners. All right, if I called the banners, would you guys come to my aid? Like,

942
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:07,500
if I made a World of Warcraft account, I was like, call the banners. I want gold from everybody.

943
02:46:07,819 --> 02:46:23,819
Would it work? No. Yeah, it would. Why wouldn't it? I mean, I'm never going to play World of

944
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:58,979
Warcraft. Don't worry. Oh my god. This is a nice car. You still did Shadowlands. I literally

945
02:46:58,979 --> 02:47:12,459
installed it. Played it for like a week and didn't do anything. If it was an FPS game,

946
02:47:12,459 --> 02:47:32,469
maybe I would. A whole week? What the hell? Why did they have to do that cutscene?

947
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:38,149
So, friendly fire? Yep. Best thing is, owning it gives us a discount. It's 100 bucks.

948
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:47,190
$500 per hour? That's a huge deal. This city's full of businesses and buildings we can snatch

949
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:51,030
up. The more we take from the syndicate, the better. Right. I thought we were going to need

950
02:47:51,030 --> 02:47:55,430
steel port on our side too. Drop around and see if we got any fancy. All right, I want some new

951
02:47:55,430 --> 02:48:06,090
stuff. Grenades level two. No, it's too much. That's way too much money. What about, is there

952
02:48:06,090 --> 02:48:19,219
any melee weapons I can buy? 27 grand. No way. Mollusk launcher? What do I get that?

953
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:31,100
I like the shotgun. What is this thing? The shark-o-matic? What are these weird cartoon

954
02:48:31,100 --> 02:48:49,260
guns? These are TF2 guns. I need them. Oh, give me this thing. Yeah. I'll take that.

955
02:48:59,579 --> 02:49:15,319
Buy grenades. Let's go. What do we got in here? You already own the shark one. Do? What the

956
02:49:15,319 --> 02:49:28,899
fuck? What are these? All DLC weapons or something? I already own them. Well,

957
02:49:28,899 --> 02:49:40,520
I'm going to equip them. Why not? Buy ammo. There's only one shot. Okay. Well, I'm kind of concerned.

958
02:49:41,639 --> 02:50:12,040
Let's go. Find the sex doll. Who's talking? Oh, somebody died. Somebody died. Did I just kill

959
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:16,940
that person? No, that's not fair. That's not fair. They were already dead in the road and I just,

960
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:22,600
I didn't kill that person. They already were dead in the road. That shouldn't be attributed to me.

961
02:50:36,309 --> 02:50:41,510
I don't, I hate that thing. I don't want that. All right. Find the sex doll.

962
02:50:45,030 --> 02:50:51,190
What the hell is this? Oh, that? A little hobby of mine. Okay. I'm out of here. I don't mean like

963
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:55,430
that. Collectibles. They're collectible. You're supposed to try and find them all. People collect

964
02:50:55,430 --> 02:51:00,870
some weird shit. Let's get out of here. How do they need to shoot something now? Don't you dare.

965
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:24,620
I didn't do anything. All right. Estates. I'm so sorry. Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty.

966
02:51:33,239 --> 02:51:37,079
I have a question for all of you guys. For all of you, all you negative Andes.

967
02:51:38,540 --> 02:51:50,459
Negative Andes. I have a question. Did you say go fuck yourself? Okay. Listen. Do you be honest?

968
02:51:50,459 --> 02:51:55,260
I want you to be completely honest with me. Don't lie to me. Don't act like a dick. Just be honest.

969
02:51:55,260 --> 02:52:01,930
Please. Do you, did you think that, I don't know, like, oh, all your friends are watching. So you

970
02:52:01,930 --> 02:52:05,860
have to like make sure you type carefully because all they're going to hear. Did you think that

971
02:52:05,860 --> 02:52:16,600
season one and two in Rick and Morty of Rick and Morty was good? Come on. I want you to be

972
02:52:16,600 --> 02:52:33,000
honest with me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So then so then we can agree, right?

973
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:45,559
Okay. Right. Up until the up until the Pickle Rick episode is when I liked it. Sounds perfect.

974
02:52:45,559 --> 02:52:49,079
We wipe them off a corner. They'll think twice about coming back. You know what? I really think

975
02:52:49,079 --> 02:52:54,040
it was when that copy pasta was first created. Everybody didn't want to watch the show anymore.

976
02:52:56,139 --> 02:53:09,450
I think that's what it was. I think everybody collectively all went fuck. I think that's what

977
02:53:09,450 --> 02:53:27,610
it was. That one guy ruined everything. Yeah. No, you know what? I think actually, you know what

978
02:53:27,610 --> 02:53:34,180
it was for me? What I think what it was for me was the sauce thing, right? It was like, where's my

979
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:41,239
sauce? Right. I think that's what it was for me. I remember seeing the sauce thing and I was like,

980
02:53:41,319 --> 02:53:51,590
fuck, fuck. Okay. Can I like this show anymore? I feel like I can't anymore. What the fuck?

981
02:53:55,530 --> 02:54:02,600
What the hell does the weapon do? Good times.

982
02:54:05,159 --> 02:54:23,260
Up to the north. I just what the fuck just happened, man? What happened? I'm so confused.

983
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:27,260
I don't even know how to play the game anymore. That was never supposed to happen in my life.

984
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:33,100
That was never a thing that was ever going to happen on screen. I was about to say this

985
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:44,760
weapon sucks. Okay. The Venture Brothers are good. All the old adult swimming shows were awesome.

986
02:54:48,059 --> 02:54:54,100
I actually I don't really like new adult swim. I know I'm older, right? Am I just older and I

987
02:54:54,100 --> 02:55:08,569
don't care? Or is this with my boomer Andy here? All right. Shark. How do I get the shark to come

988
02:55:08,569 --> 02:55:37,850
up? Where's the shark? Where's the shark? Oh my goodness. What about these little things?

989
02:55:39,129 --> 02:55:52,629
What does it do? What is happening? Ethical. I'm so confused. It makes them your friend.

990
02:55:53,959 --> 02:56:22,360
Oh, I get it. All right. Who's my friend now? Shit. Stop. Can I? All right. I'm going to ethical

991
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:41,100
that. Come on. How do I revive? Let's do it again. I was so shocked by those those new

992
02:56:41,100 --> 02:56:49,930
abilities that I couldn't play. Okay, so let's go. I was right. So don't swim all over the

993
02:56:49,930 --> 02:56:55,049
city doing deals and shit. I remember Aqua teen. They'll think twice about coming back.

994
02:56:55,049 --> 02:57:06,420
I wasn't a big fan of robot chicken. Not really. Robot chicken to me was just only family guy

995
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:12,790
cutaways. There was nothing else. It was just the family guy cutaways. And I liked family guy. I

996
02:57:12,790 --> 02:57:16,870
thought I liked family guys like actual stuff they did in the first like six or seven seasons.

997
02:57:17,590 --> 02:57:22,840
But it was that whole show was just a just cutaway jokes. I mean, I just was I was like,

998
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:41,540
yeah, it's okay. Yeah, the first five to 10 seasons of family guy were they had hit character.

999
02:57:41,540 --> 02:57:50,940
I think they were fun and funny. You see smiling friends. It was fucking hilarious. Oh, yeah.

1000
02:57:53,540 --> 02:57:57,780
That's adult swim. But I feel like that's one of the only shows I've seen. I actually like

1001
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:09,319
Come on. It's bugged out. This needed another fucking two years in development.

1002
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:16,549
Yeah, but this should have been in development for two more years. Unbelievable. You know, I mean,

1003
02:58:16,549 --> 02:58:45,139
like other cops in the gang cars. Where did they come from? All right, let's go.

1004
02:58:45,700 --> 02:58:51,899
You don't look like having fun. Yeah, I'm having fun. What are you talking about?

1005
02:58:52,540 --> 02:58:58,180
This game's hilarious. I just I did the first hour of this game. I did not like I will be honest.

1006
02:58:59,530 --> 02:59:03,780
I felt like I wasn't even playing a game. Now I'm having this is a great game. I have fun.

1007
02:59:04,500 --> 02:59:08,659
I mean, I could I would appreciate it like another year in development, though.

1008
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:21,909
He came up. I killed that guy so bad. He came off the driver's side.

1009
02:59:30,170 --> 02:59:36,280
Yeah, the first hour I was like, yeah, but I gave it time. And now I'm having a good time.

1010
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:46,569
I think the game is really fun. Oh, God, is he dead? Oh, shit. This is going to kill him.

1011
02:59:46,569 --> 03:00:11,530
Whatever. I'll revive him. Come on. Don't kill me with this shit. Dude, don't even do that.

1012
03:00:12,250 --> 03:00:14,489
Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car.

1013
03:00:20,889 --> 03:00:45,940
Don't kill me, please. I don't want to restart. What is he shooting at? Oh, my God. I would love

1014
03:00:45,940 --> 03:01:01,020
to lower my notoriety if my passenger wasn't firing out the window. And there's a jump right

1015
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:17,799
here. And it would be cool. Oh, my. Just get out. Just kill these fucking people following us.

1016
03:01:17,799 --> 03:01:32,950
They won't leave us alone. So just get rid of them. OK, let's go. Let's go. Bike. They spawned in.

1017
03:01:32,950 --> 03:01:42,870
They actually spawned in. What are you doing? Let's go. Get on the bike. Don't get in your

1018
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:52,459
own car. What are you out of your mind? You idiot. Stop. Get on my whatever. I'm leaving you.

1019
03:02:05,450 --> 03:02:23,850
I need to hide. You fucking asshole. Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right? Because I'm saying

1020
03:02:23,850 --> 03:02:29,350
to be at the wedding stuff and I could tell I was back in Massachusetts. It's been it had been a

1021
03:02:29,350 --> 03:02:36,549
while. I was driving and I just hear I'm just sitting there. I pull through red light and I

1022
03:02:36,549 --> 03:02:44,260
just hear out the window. You fucking douchebag. Somebody was just screaming at somebody like out

1023
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:56,299
the window. I was like, oh, yep. Oh, I I'm in I'm in Boston again. You passed it. Oh, shit.

1024
03:03:02,709 --> 03:03:08,069
Where is he going? It's called not paying any attention to being on complete and total autopilot

1025
03:03:08,069 --> 03:03:23,620
while I talk. What do you stop? What do you stop it? What is he doing? What are you doing?

1026
03:03:25,270 --> 03:03:29,270
Um, why are you doing that? There's nobody here to shoot at. He's just shooting at random.

1027
03:03:29,270 --> 03:03:46,579
All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna dump this guy. Are we hiding? Does this count as hiding?

1028
03:03:46,579 --> 03:04:10,649
Not two more. I guess should be two more years in development. Buy grenades.

1029
03:04:12,250 --> 03:04:28,969
What can I buy a melee weapon? Doesn't look like it. We're gonna get a melee weapon. You can.

1030
03:04:29,770 --> 03:04:32,489
Oh, it's the taser slot. Okay, it's not the actual punching slot.

1031
03:04:33,450 --> 03:04:54,280
Cool. Oh, sure. Okay. What would level? Okay.

1032
03:04:57,940 --> 03:05:42,280
Can I how do you switch? How do I switch weapons? How does it work? Okay. Okay. It's fun.

1033
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:51,850
All right. So what now? Tank mayhem. You feel like blowing shit up? Go on. I'm all ears. Down the

1034
03:05:51,850 --> 03:05:58,760
route. The morning start user to the same. We drop a few pipe bombs under him. Fuck that. I'm saying

1035
03:05:58,760 --> 03:06:03,239
we use a tank. This may be the best idea you've ever had. Holy shit. Are you okay?

1036
03:06:06,809 --> 03:06:15,719
You need to go get the scout outfit now? Yeah, I do. I knew we needed a break from the team fortress

1037
03:06:15,719 --> 03:06:43,770
to joke, right? We can bring it back. Can you like kick? No. TF2 is not a joke. I said the TF2

1038
03:06:44,569 --> 03:06:51,739
joke. Not that the game is a joke. Were you listening? Come on, dude. $125,000 in property

1039
03:06:51,739 --> 03:07:07,610
damage. Sure. High value targets. Oh, this was in Saints Row 2. Yep. This is loud, by the way. I

1040
03:07:07,610 --> 03:07:34,219
realize how loud this just was. Wasn't the trick from Saints Row 2 to shoot fences? The fences

1041
03:07:34,219 --> 03:08:06,409
were worth an insane amount, right? No, 31. Okay, 40 combo. All right, I got it. The fences are

1042
03:08:06,409 --> 03:08:25,770
still the meta. Okay, good to know. Good to know. Okay, cool. I didn't want to do that.

1043
03:08:31,159 --> 03:08:39,139
Professor Genki. You ready to be a star? I thought we already were. Oh, no. What's the

1044
03:08:39,139 --> 03:08:45,110
running melee? You've been personally selected for a spot on a game show. You're not trying to

1045
03:08:45,110 --> 03:08:49,909
auction me off on some dating thing, are you? Trust me, you'll love this shit. Meet me and I'll

1046
03:08:49,909 --> 03:09:13,739
show you. You better be right. Oh, nice car. Nice car. He has no emotion when he's killing people.

1047
03:09:14,540 --> 03:09:31,299
I'm... Nice car immediately crashes it. This is Saints Row. Okay, this is Saints Row.

1048
03:09:35,770 --> 03:09:42,969
Hello, Steelport, and welcome to Professor Genki's super ethical reality climax. Time to see how the

1049
03:09:42,969 --> 03:09:49,290
game is playing. Fight your way through Professor Genki's super sparkle app for fun and profit.

1050
03:09:49,930 --> 03:09:56,889
Now with every man, woman, and tiger shot, your prize money goes up. Look out. No one likes it

1051
03:09:56,889 --> 03:10:02,329
when you shoot a panda. Don't shoot panda. Once you've collected enough money,

1052
03:10:02,329 --> 03:10:06,489
the door to the lab opens up, and you're free to go. But if you think it's that easy,

1053
03:10:08,010 --> 03:10:15,049
you've never seen Genki before. Oh, and one more thing. On this show, no one gets to take a break.

1054
03:10:15,049 --> 03:10:21,450
If you want to stay in the fight, be sure to shoot the worst aid target. Good luck. It's murder time.

1055
03:10:22,010 --> 03:10:32,280
Fun time. Earn money by destroying targets, killing enemies, and exiting the arena before time runs

1056
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:37,959
out. If you destroy things in quick succession, you'll earn a bonus. Let's go. Welcome to Professor

1057
03:10:37,959 --> 03:10:45,959
Genki's super epic reality climax. Time is fun time, right Bobby? You got it, Zack. If our contestants

1058
03:10:45,959 --> 03:10:51,799
can survive the deadly traps, armed mascots, and those freakishly huge hunters, they can win a

1059
03:10:51,799 --> 03:10:59,159
hefty pile of cash. This game looks deadly because it is, but it's still probably safer than driving

1060
03:10:59,159 --> 03:11:05,799
in Steelport. Our competitor isn't from Steelport this time, Zack. Genki is watching the leader of

1061
03:11:05,799 --> 03:11:11,799
the Saints, the world famous Stillwater Street Gang. As many times as this former gang banger

1062
03:11:11,799 --> 03:11:18,280
has been shot at, blown up, run over, and generally put through hell, this competition probably seems

1063
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:24,360
pretty routine. Um, routine maybe, but lucrative. You are going to make Professor Genki sized

1064
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:34,389
dollars driving hoes around, that's for sure. Chuching. Destruction. Our contestant is clapping

1065
03:11:34,389 --> 03:11:39,350
her back in Steelport. Have you ever been to Stillwater, Bobby? I did, and it wasn't a good

1066
03:11:39,350 --> 03:11:46,149
trip. My car got covered in sewage by a passing septic truck. Really? What did you do to piss off

1067
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:50,870
the driver? Destruction. I didn't do a damn thing. I just wish I had rented a convertible.

1068
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:56,790
Wait, you were in the car? Is that? It is. We have a present. A present is in the maze.

1069
03:12:01,350 --> 03:12:14,700
This is really amazing shooting. Cash in pocket. Carnage. Quite a performance so far.

1070
03:12:20,100 --> 03:12:25,379
Like sticking a fork in a socket. How can anyone recover from that?

1071
03:12:26,100 --> 03:12:35,129
I hope the money is worth this. So Bobby, how do you clean sewage out of a convertible?

1072
03:12:35,129 --> 03:12:40,409
With a tumor brush. Really? No, I let the rental company take care of it. Are you kidding me?

1073
03:12:40,409 --> 03:12:45,850
What's that kind of shitty of you? Not as shitty as what this contestant is doing to those mascots.

1074
03:12:46,489 --> 03:12:53,659
Mayhem. How do you shake that one off? I'm trying to jump over it. I can't jump over this?

1075
03:12:53,739 --> 03:13:01,510
Valuable seconds. That's some great action.

1076
03:13:03,989 --> 03:13:16,860
Every shot seems to hit something today. He's not dead. I didn't get points for that. I didn't get

1077
03:13:16,860 --> 03:13:47,510
points yet. I'm still getting a hit marker. What's going on? Chaos. Carnage. I'm making a lot of

1078
03:13:47,510 --> 03:14:09,719
money now. Cool. We've only just begun. I'm surprised the syndicate is still standing. How

1079
03:14:09,719 --> 03:14:14,440
many times did you get electrocuted? I don't know. I'm not saying we should. All right,

1080
03:14:14,440 --> 03:14:28,520
then see you at the broken chile. Is that a cement mixer? What the fuck? Oh my god. What is this?

1081
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:43,030
Down's wasted. He has the face. He's wearing the head. He's driving a car with it. What?

1082
03:14:48,420 --> 03:15:31,750
Damn, I'm good. Holy shit. Okay. Fucking douchebag. What is this?

1083
03:15:32,629 --> 03:15:51,020
Oh my goodness. Okay. Give me a fucking goddamn controller. That's the fucking mouse. Whatever.

1084
03:15:53,129 --> 03:15:58,889
Controller aim is just like, okay, I'm putting my head under water and then playing.

1085
03:16:03,379 --> 03:16:14,700
You really don't want to ride with me. Let's go. I'm surprised the syndicate is still standing

1086
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:18,540
after all this shit we've thrown at him. I don't see a reason to stop. Not saying we should.

1087
03:16:19,100 --> 03:16:24,739
Your cousin from Boston. It's a fucking lager. You don't know what a lager is, dude.

1088
03:16:25,620 --> 03:16:42,280
I'm your cousin. I wasn't looking. It's always so funny that Boston people in commercials,

1089
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:50,040
TV shows and whatever, they're always a cartoon character. Like, don't you just imagine that

1090
03:16:50,040 --> 03:16:53,239
all the people that are like all the Boston people that are in all these commercials and

1091
03:16:53,239 --> 03:17:12,420
TV shows are going to bring out a big cartoon mallet. I'm a cartoon character? No, you're not.

1092
03:17:15,219 --> 03:17:16,420
Wait, I can do that?

1093
03:17:16,979 --> 03:17:39,530
I don't know that. I don't know how I could go all the way back like this.

1094
03:17:40,329 --> 03:17:48,889
How far can I go? We'll see. Holy shit. Can I just be like this for the rest of the day?

1095
03:17:49,610 --> 03:18:06,860
My old chair didn't do that. That old chair sucked, by the way. Can I be honest? Nice. Okay.

1096
03:18:10,809 --> 03:18:24,549
That chair sucked. That chair made you. Is it better? Yeah. I don't want to

1097
03:18:25,190 --> 03:18:28,790
say too too much about like, oh, yeah, wow, everything's amazing. But I definitely feel

1098
03:18:29,430 --> 03:18:34,420
it doesn't look more comfortable. I told you there's a crank on the back of the chair that

1099
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:44,260
I can like crank, crank, crank, crank, crank and get it. Oh my God. What the get on the bike.

1100
03:18:45,219 --> 03:18:57,590
Shani, give me good news. We're going to burn powder to the ground. That's

1101
03:18:58,389 --> 03:19:05,610
okay. Let's go stream. See you there, Shani. Wait. Oh boy. Yeah. So something I didn't know

1102
03:19:06,649 --> 03:19:12,489
when you get, yeah, it's the, it's the gaming chair with the, um, it's such an E

1103
03:19:14,709 --> 03:19:21,350
as whatever the Herman Miller gaming one is. Check what it's E. No, no, not the easy gamer.

1104
03:19:23,829 --> 03:19:28,549
The embody. Yeah. It's the one that was, it's the blue one, the blue and the black one.

1105
03:19:29,110 --> 03:19:41,430
Cause I, although the gaming chair is, I don't, I don't like the fucking, I hate those things.

1106
03:19:44,309 --> 03:19:55,700
Putting your tampons and let's do this. The chair that I had before. Yeah. This is way,

1107
03:19:56,579 --> 03:20:08,149
way more expensive. I had the chair that I had before, I think was 500 or 600.

1108
03:20:10,040 --> 03:20:17,190
And it was like, Oh, back support, lumbar and cushion. And this to me feels more like a,

1109
03:20:17,190 --> 03:20:24,620
like a chair, like a chair, like a real chair. I think the problem that I had a lot of times

1110
03:20:24,620 --> 03:20:31,639
sitting in a chair for like an office chair, whatever is it was so cushiony that I felt

1111
03:20:31,639 --> 03:20:37,479
like I wasn't sitting in a chair. This to me is, this to me is a chair, a real chair.

1112
03:20:39,319 --> 03:20:43,959
Did I just drive in a circle? Oh, I'm sorry. No, I'm serious. This is my kind of plan.

1113
03:20:43,959 --> 03:20:51,659
What are we going? I forget what happened. All right, we're good. Let's get inside.

1114
03:20:55,100 --> 03:21:04,010
But I mean, I think I'm trying to think of how much these retail for a lot in charge here,

1115
03:21:04,010 --> 03:21:08,170
probably knows where to find the office and see if they're hiding under their desk.

1116
03:21:10,579 --> 03:21:12,899
But let me put it this way. My back feels like it's

1117
03:21:14,170 --> 03:21:19,129
propped up. Because before I kind of could just sink in and slouch a little. But this is like,

1118
03:21:19,129 --> 03:21:28,040
I'm in the chair. I'm sitting in a chair. Seriously. You both assume with sniper rifles

1119
03:21:28,040 --> 03:21:40,020
from like 15 feet away, you fucking assholes. I couldn't even reload. You know, also I like

1120
03:21:40,020 --> 03:21:48,170
about this thing. Maybe I'll show you. You can pull the seat forward. Alright, so here's like,

1121
03:21:48,170 --> 03:21:53,059
here's your ass, right? Well, this is like your ass sitting in the chair. I'll just show you.

1122
03:21:53,620 --> 03:21:56,500
No, I mean, I like pajamas on. I'll show you like tomorrow, the next day.

1123
03:22:00,139 --> 03:22:06,379
The bottom of the chair. If you've got a big fat ass, you could this the ass part of the chair

1124
03:22:06,379 --> 03:22:11,420
can be extended, which is a huge deal to me. An absolutely massive fucking deal.

1125
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:16,059
So this has a setting that you can adjust for a huge ass.

1126
03:22:16,940 --> 03:22:21,180
It's in charge here probably knows where to find Loren. Let's head to the office and see if they're

1127
03:22:21,180 --> 03:22:27,670
hiding under the seat is like collapsible. It comes in and out. You like can pull the bottom out so

1128
03:22:27,670 --> 03:22:36,090
it's why like longer and wider almost. And I feel like my big fat ass is sitting in this comfortably.

1129
03:22:36,729 --> 03:23:11,639
Okay, I gotta go upstairs. Find a way upstairs. Let's go. I can't get up there. There we go.

1130
03:23:11,639 --> 03:23:16,440
You're never going to get a job after you stream. Because I have a huge ass.

1131
03:23:17,479 --> 03:23:23,530
Oh, Mr. Albukson, we're really happy. We really think you're very qualified for this job here at

1132
03:23:23,530 --> 03:23:27,850
Stevenson and Stevenson Associates. But I'm sorry, your ass is too big. We're not going to be able

1133
03:23:27,850 --> 03:23:32,010
to fit you any chairs. No chairs in this office will be able to do it. I'm sorry, but your ass

1134
03:23:32,010 --> 03:23:49,159
is too big. What are you talking about? Why are you standing in front of a Gatling gun? I got this.

1135
03:23:52,680 --> 03:24:00,540
Why why why why why why why am I gonna put a grenade in his mouth? That's gonna hurt us.

1136
03:24:03,190 --> 03:24:27,860
Oh boy. Yep. Come on, let's go go go go go. The arm rest can can move

1137
03:24:28,500 --> 03:24:34,600
like wider or. I like it. Let's see after like a week though, because that's a real test here.

1138
03:24:36,020 --> 03:24:42,500
I know a lot of guys know I have pretty bad like back and spine like chest pain shit.

1139
03:24:42,500 --> 03:24:51,250
it I'll give you my real assessment in like a week cuz I feel like it's gonna

1140
03:24:51,250 --> 03:24:56,799
take a while for me to figure that out and I'm not gonna bullshit you I'm not

1159
03:28:46,049 --> 03:29:02,500
want that car that is a nice car do you guys remember all the GTA 4 videos

1160
03:29:02,500 --> 03:29:05,540
where I one of the funny things I thought was the funniest thing in those

1161
03:29:05,540 --> 03:29:14,899
videos what I really tried to capture all right bye I always wanted to drive

1162
03:29:14,899 --> 03:29:20,219
really fast and I would like whether it was like stir or like boo and mostly

1163
03:29:20,219 --> 03:29:23,420
stealth it was like oh yeah you drive the opposite ways fast you can I drive

1164
03:29:23,420 --> 03:29:27,739
the other way as fast as I can and we're gonna line it up perfectly so when I

1165
03:29:27,739 --> 03:29:31,979
dive out of the car it's the perfect angle and the perfect amount of force

1166
03:29:31,979 --> 03:29:37,620
where I'm gonna fly out and I'm going to hit my fucking head directly into the

1167
03:29:37,620 --> 03:29:56,719
front of your car oh my goodness but uh but yeah but that was me though that was

1168
03:29:56,719 --> 03:30:22,920

1169
03:30:22,920 --> 03:30:26,319
always try to jump out so I got my so I could hit my fucking head directly into

1170

this moment what am i doing get over here i need the needle gun the needle gun was always so

1189
03:34:41,809 --> 03:34:50,129
satisfying because i was terrible with the needle gun truly awful but sometimes every once in a while

1190
03:34:51,090 --> 03:34:55,709
you would go like this you'd be running down a hallway stop what is going on who's shooting

1191
03:34:55,709 --> 03:35:10,299
that stop firing your gun shut up shut the fuck up shut up so every so often you would fire the

1192
03:35:10,299 --> 03:35:13,420
you'd be going down a hallway somebody would be coming this way and you would get it completely

1193
03:35:13,420 --> 03:35:20,290
perfectly where you'd go you'd go like and you'd watch it take two or three seconds to

1194
03:35:22,079 --> 03:35:27,389
and you kill that dad you'd kill him what a fucking fun game why didn't we wait to do that

1195
03:35:27,389 --> 03:35:33,549
until after we kill lorenz that's a really good question like 15 minutes dude all right we gotta

1196
03:35:33,549 --> 03:35:44,819
go i'm not i'm not angry every time i have a facial hair people think i'm mad every day

1197
03:35:47,700 --> 03:36:30,299
it's just i remember rage quitting a server because there was one spy in the other team

1198
03:36:31,020 --> 03:36:36,700
that was unkillable and killed every single fucking person and no one could play the game

1199
03:36:37,260 --> 03:36:47,579
remember that and you'd see the top frag list and it would be this person is spy 80 points

1200
03:36:47,579 --> 03:36:54,719
and then the next person under there was an engineer with like six all right up up up up

50 to 60 cars are gonna show up we're gonna be leaning out the window firing at it you new

1242
03:46:48,340 --> 03:47:36,270
to the saints time for the high spot boys you know why don't we all just split the money

1243
03:47:37,069 --> 03:47:43,629
the amount of money that we all have to spend as different gangs on new cars and new ammo and new

1244
03:47:43,629 --> 03:47:48,510
personnel they flow pretty damn good we would have been in profit if we just split all the money

1245
03:47:49,309 --> 03:47:54,909
equally exactly here's the syndicate sir tech dog what he did to johnny's funeral that's over

1247
03:48:01,469 --> 03:48:05,309
work with six to seven million dollars in cars that you have to spend because people keep blowing

1248
03:48:05,309 --> 03:48:09,790
them up watch us versus what it would take if we just split all the assets together like would

1505
04:43:36,990 --> 04:43:46,419
difference this game just yeah this game got way more fun the last like four hours have been so

1506
04:43:46,419 --> 04:43:50,740
much more fun that first i don't you know i think it was the audio being screwed up

1507
04:43:51,840 --> 04:43:58,639
and i didn't really have an opportunity to do anything so yeah that first hour was like

1508

1511
04:44:23,330 --> 04:44:28,450
