1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:15,109
My tweet is still about the urinal. It's alright. Don't worry. My next tweet is going to be about TwitchCon.

2
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,989
My next tweet will be a selfie in front of the TwitchCon arena.

3
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:34,509
We'll be doing the peace sign and going, made it! Here we are!

4
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:41,259
That's it. And then I won't tweet for like another four months.

5
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:46,689
I'll tweet like four months later. Just got off the plane! Back from TwitchCon!

6
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:52,590
Oh, it was awesome! You were at TwitchCon for four months.

7
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:08,439
Anyways, I wish you tweeted your updates instead of only posting them in Twitch chat.

8
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,439
Come on. I'm a Twitch streamer. That's what I have to do.

9
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:21,159
I'm not a Twitter streamer. I'm a Twitch streamer. So if I'm in Twitch chat...

10
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,939
I'm not going to... There's no Twitter chat. This is the platform.

11
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,140
Jerma, how come you don't... Jerma, how come you don't ever update your Facebook?

12
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:42,819
Because that shit's run by aliens! And they're taking all of our data!

13
00:01:42,819 --> 00:02:03,469
Oh, dude, this guy is woke. No. I kid. I kid.

14
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,900
I just don't... I don't really do social media. I really just don't. I never have and never will.

15
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:20,080
Guys, I call grandma. I don't put a thumbs up on grandma's post about her birthday.

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:33,620
I go to grandma's house for her birthday. Come on. You are the grandma.

17
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,930
And I can't wait until all my grandkids, they all come to grandpa Jeremy's house.

18
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm going to be so angry if I have a grandpa's 80th birthday party and my 40 to 50 grandchildren,

19
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,620
like 48 of them just do like a little thumbs up on a picture of me.

20
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,789
And two of them show up. I'll be very upset about that because I know.

21
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:14,969
I know what that is. Those two are the good ones.

22
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:22,240
Anyways, we're going to do some more FMV tonight. Hopefully internet permitting.

23
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,759
There's been a lot of weird issues with the internet that we're trying to figure out.

24
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,759
We don't think it's really Cox related. We think it's construction related.

25
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,659
Because it's been odd. It's been very odd.

26
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,969
There's construction going on outside. It's like, what the heck?

27
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:52,819
And it's been kind of shutting us off. So we'll go, we'll see how far this one goes.

28
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:02,680
Also, if you have not, hold on. If you have not given a submission to the Activity Book Discord,

29
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,680
that stream's happening in a few days. This is the last day you can.

30
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,860
Where's Waldo? A dot to dot, a activity image.

31
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,860
If you want to contribute something and you think it would be fun,

32
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,860
we're just going to pull the ones that we think are the best.

33
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,100
And if there's more time, we can do other ones too.

34
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,490
So today's the last day. After today, the submissions are all going to close.

35
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,660
Am I crying? I thought I was, I thought I could hide it.

36
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,660
I thought I could hide it, but apparently I can't.

37
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,259
I've been trying to hold it in for like five straight minutes.

38
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:48,240
No. I like burnt my throat drinking coffee too fast.

39
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,420
I needed it. I took a sip of coffee when it was way too hot and it ruined me.

40
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,420
It ruined my voice and this is just what happens.

41
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:04,110
I'll be fine in like 10. I sound great. What are you talking about?

42
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,990
I sound good right now. I sound very bass, heavy.

43
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,230
If you've got a system, if you've got like a subwoofer,

44
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,230
right now, if you turn everything else down, turn all the treble to zero,

45
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,230
turn the mid down to zero, just to have bass, you're going to hear this.

46
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:31,230
It sounds fucking great. I can hear it. I can feel it.

47
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:46,269
Anyways, let's put a name in because the first game we're going to play on our

48
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:51,269
journey through the world of old full motion video games is

49
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,899
Steven Spielberg's Director's Chair.

50
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:01,129
This game, you have to make movies in this game.

51
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,129
I did this this month. This here's a potential, right?

52
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:11,310
Let me tell you, this one will last 30 minutes or three hours.

53
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:19,339
You have to pick and edit and shoot a movie with real actors.

54
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:34,500
Let's go. First name, last name.

55
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:45,779
No, I can't do wouldn't you like to know.

56
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,990
Jeremy Albertson. Let's go.

57
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,339
Hopefully it's not too loud. It's probably going to be very loud.

58
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,930
I haven't done any of that. It's all right.

59
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,930
Oh, it's very loud.

60
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:14,129
Steven Spielberg presents a Jeremy Albertson film.

61
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,129
I didn't do anything.

62
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:25,490
Starring Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino.

63
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,459
This is what you do when you're like 14.

64
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:34,459
Penn and Teller, Catherine Hellman and Barry Corbin.

65
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,209
This is what you do when you're 14 and you're like envisioning yourself as the

66
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,209
director of the movie.

67
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm going to have Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino and Penn and Teller

68
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
are going to do magic.

69
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
It's like, OK.

70
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,589
What are we looking at?

71
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:56,220
Is this one going? State 17.

72
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
Watch your back. Am I in jail?

73
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,339
Oh, where is this one going?

74
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:13,899
There he is.

75
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:14,899
Me? Smiley.

76
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,399
Now making movies is one of the greatest jobs in the world.

77
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:23,399
You've got to have talent and intuition, patience and energy.

78
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,399
OK. And the real innate ability to tell a story and a comfortable pair of shoes.

79
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,399
Of course, a great crew is also essential.

80
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,399
So I've handpicked some of the best people in Hollywood to work with you.

81
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,399
And I'll be around to guide you through the process from writing the script to

82
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,399
premiering the film.

83
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,399
OK.

84
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,399
The movie you're about to personally make.

85
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,399
I'm going to make the movie.

86
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,399
Go to Studio Operations and please sign in.

87
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,110
OK.

88
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,059
What the fuck is that?

89
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:56,419
Why is there an earthquake?

90
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,620
What?

91
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,759
Whoa.

92
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,759
Just a minor tremor.

93
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,759
Nothing to really worry about.

94
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,759
Huh?

95
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,759
Welcome to Southern California.

96
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,759
I'm your P.A.

97
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,759
That's short for Production Assistant.

98
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,759
Come on into Operations to sign in.

99
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,759
You can't start production until you do.

100
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,759
What's it like?

101
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,759
Like Mother Goose window.

102
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,759
OK.

103
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:24,730
Coming to Studio Exit.

104
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,610
Free Pro.

105
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,610
All right. Let's go in here.

106
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,330
Here's my computer.

107
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,330
I'm here to assist you.

108
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,330
If you ever need help, just click on the pager.

109
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,330
I'll leave it here on the desk.

110
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,330
Oh, I know I have it here somewhere.

111
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,330
One second.

112
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,950
Pager.

113
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,950
Got it.

114
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,429
Just throwing it over here?

115
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:51,309
OK.

116
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,309
Now this is Studio Operations.

117
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:54,309
She just like underhanded it under the desk.

118
00:09:54,309 --> 00:10:00,409
Grab one of the blank slates and then sign in.

119
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,409
Is that supposed to be a...

120
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,409
Oh, OK.

121
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,409
That was him pressing the button on the computer.

122
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:09,679
OK.

123
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,679
Blank slate.

124
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,679
If your name is correct, hit OK.

125
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
No.

126
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,679
That's not my real name.

127
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,679
I'm going to use my director name.

128
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,049
Don't you guys know?

129
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,049
You've got to use a stage name.

130
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,049
I'm not going to use my real name.

131
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:27,809
What the fuck?

132
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:32,100
I've got to use my stage name.

133
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
No, that's not...

134
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:40,159
What's a better one?

135
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,340
No, that's...

136
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Hatting...

137
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:59,220
Jeremy...

138
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Hey, what's your name?

139
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Oh, yeah.

140
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,220
It's me.

141
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,100
Jeremy French Film Director.

142
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Jeremy French Film.

143
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I like it.

144
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,529
Jeremy French...

145
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:14,860
French fries.

146
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Jeremy French Fry.

147
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
What a stupid fucking name.

148
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,860
All right.

149
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Jeremy...

150
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
It's me.

151
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Jeremy French Fry.

152
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,919
Click on the newspaper when you're done reading it.

153
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,919
Daily Variety.

154
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,919
Jeremy French Fry hired to direct film.

155
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,919
That's such a child name.

156
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,919
OK.

157
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,220
Let's go.

158
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,039
The guys at the studio are thrilled you're directing this picture,

159
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,039
but they run a tight ship here,

160
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,039
so they're going to monitor your budget and schedule on a daily basis.

161
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,039
How much money do I get?

162
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,039
Here.

163
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,039
Take a look, then click on it to move on.

164
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,039
All right.

165
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,039
Let's take a look at the budget.

166
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,039
Click on the budget when you're done reviewing it.

167
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,039
Hollywood is filled with stories of people who've cheated their way to the top.

168
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,039
While strongly recommending that you advance by hard work and raw talent,

169
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,039
we do provide the means to cheat your way up to more advanced levels of play.

170
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,220
Click on the PA pager button and check the user's guide for details, but beware.

171
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,399
Am I already getting, like, time to cheat your way to the top?

172
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,220

173
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,220
Click on the...

174
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,220
No, let's go.

175
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,220
You should go next door to pre-production to start writing your script.

176
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,220
Click on the exit icon over there to go out to the lot.

177
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,220
OK.

178
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,649
No, I'm not cheating.

179
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,649
I never cheated in my YouTube or Twitch career.

180
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:38,649
Why would I do it here?

181
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,889
It was hard work.

182
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:42,889
It was sweat.

183
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:52,889
Just move your mouse to the right or the left and have a look around.

184
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:56,879
All right, so where do we need to go?

185
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,879
The production office or...

186
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,379
Seagull.

187
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:05,580
OK, why is the seagull animated and these ones are the JPGs?

188
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
I don't understand.

189
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:13,940
Why is this one animated?

190
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,500
Stage 17.

191
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
What did she say to go?

192
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I was talking over her.

193
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,250
This is studio graphics for...

194
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,250
Oh, my God.

195
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,769
Product credits.

196
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,769
Studio theater.

197
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:35,299
All right, where do I need to go?

198
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:36,299
This one here?

199
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:40,740
What the fuck is that?

200
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Am I getting, like, the birds coming in, too?

201
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,700
It all begins with the written word.

202
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,700
We owe our careers to the writers.

203
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,700
And my saying has always been, if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage.

204
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,700
So we got you a couple of positively and really amazing, terrific writers,

205
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Ted and Terry, or Terry and Ted, who have their own ideas.

206
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,700
So learn early to collaborate, knowing that in the end,

207
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,700
it's you who must make the final decision about the story that you want to tell.

208
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
So this is your first time up at that.

209
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Keep it nice and simple.

210
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Keep it simple?

211
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,700
The story that's been greenlit is that of a prisoner wrongly accused of murder

212
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,700
who's about to be executed unless his girlfriend can find who set him up.

213
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
What?

214
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Unfortunately, this studio is only willing to let you tell one side of the story.

215
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,700
So whose story do you want to tell, the prisoners or the girlfriends?

216
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, shit.

217
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,139
I think we got to go.

218
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,139
We got to go in.

219
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,139
We got to go in prison.

220
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,230
We got to do prison.

221
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,440
I'm doing prisoner.

222
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Great choice.

223
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
That's exactly the way we would have gone.

224
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
My name's Ted.

225
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
My name's Terry.

226
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
We co-wrote the animated film Aladdin.

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
And so in Hollywood, we're the perfect pair to write a prison picture.

228
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
That was an instant flex.

229
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
We're really excited to be working with you.

230
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Instant flex.

231
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Hey, we're your biggest fans.

232
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Biggest fans.

233
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Now listen, do you want to give some creative input in this story,

234
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
or should we write it alone?

235
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
What am I doing here?

236
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
What am I doing here?

237
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Now, I want to do it.

238
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,129
Otherwise, I'm just a camera that walks around and looks at stuff.

239
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,129
I want to work on the script.

240
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,389
Okay, great.

241
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,389
So it's just you and me.

242
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:28,389
That's like the Lord of the Rings.

243
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:35,000
Click on the outline so we can read through it.

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
All right, script outline.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,559
After you read through the outline,

246
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,559
click on the sequence you want to use for the opening of the film.

247
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,559
And drag it over to us, and we'll write it.

248
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,559
I'll write it.

249
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,559
We'll type it.

250
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Isn't it already written?

251
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Hold on.

252
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Wait, wait, wait.

253
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,809
It's already written.

254
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:56,809
Okay.

255
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:57,809
Interior.

256
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:58,809
Prison.

257
00:15:58,809 --> 00:15:59,809
Day.

258
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,809
TV news report about Jack Cavella,

259
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,809
who is about to be sent to the electric chair.

260
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,110
All right.

261
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
Interior.

262
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,110
Two prison guards watch TV.

263
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,110
A priest comes by, and the guards accompany him to a prison cell.

264
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,110
Why is it...

265
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:18,820
The priest enters the cell of Jack Cavella, who denies all charges.

266
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Jack is escorting...

267
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,759
All right.

268
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,370
Let's go back.

269
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,370
Wait, wait, wait.

270
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,370
No.

271
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,370
No, no, no.

272
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,370
Wait a minute.

273
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,370
Wait a minute.

274
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,860
Wait a minute.

275
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:46,710
Is that good?

277
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,279
What do you think?

278
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,279
Hey!

279
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,100
Exterior.

280
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Prison.

281
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Day.

282
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Turnkey and screw wheel.

283
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
The still smoking sheet-covered body of Jack Cavella

284
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
up a ramp from the prison basement.

285
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
The warden watches and smiles.

286
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,099
Photographers flash their cameras.

287
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,099
Ma looks on, devastated.

288
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,339
The father of Laura's praise, Laura cries.

289
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,339
All right.

290
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,339
The scene is finished.

291
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,339
Why don't you take this masterpiece,

292
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,339
lay it in the script book.

293
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,339
We're on a roll now.

294
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,339
Excellent.

295
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,339
That's the whole movie.

296
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,339
All right.

297
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:26,519
Put this in the script book.

298
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,519
Anniston joins friendly cast of Jeremy French Rye's film.

299
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,589
Now that you've got the hang of it,

300
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,589
go back to the outline and select the next sequence

301
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:35,589
you want us to write.

302
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,589
The next sequence?

303
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,900
Keep it up until we finish the script.

304
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh, that, this is, okay.

305
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,710
Uh, the warden gets a call to pardon Jack.

306
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,190
Jack is set free.

307
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,190
I mean, yeah, that one's pretty good.

308
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,190
I like that one.

309
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,140
Do you see any other writers in this room?

310
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,700
I don't see any other writers.

311
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Why don't you let us, hey,

312
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
why don't you let us write that thing?

313
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,900
I think that was a pretty,

314
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
I think that was a genuine hey, man.

315
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
What the fuck?

316
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:21,730
Let's see what they come up with.

317
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,730
Mm-hmm.

318
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,730
Let me read it.

319
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,740
The warden and the executioner

320
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
stand by the electric chair switch

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
looking at the clock.

322
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
The phone rings.

323
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
The warden answers.

324
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Hello, yes, Governor?

325
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Yes, yes, of course, right away.

326
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Hold on, it seems you,

327
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
your girl's been playing

328
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
beat the clock in one.

329
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Get him out of here.

330
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:46,250
Okay, that's in there.

331
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
After he's released,

332
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,250
Jack and Laura are ringing out

333
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:59,000
on the prison steps.

334
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hold on.

335
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Jack is escorted by the two guards

336
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and he frees down the last mile

337
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
towards the electric chair.

338
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,619
Jack's mother meets him

339
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,619
at the end of the hallway.

340
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:08,619
She tells him that his girlfriend Laura

341
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,619
is looking for him.

342
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,569
For the real killer.

343
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,029
Guard takes Jack away.

344
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,029
Come on, Jack.

345
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,029
Kiss goodbye.

346
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:30,210
Yeah, the music really does not

347
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,210
match the tone.

348
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,210
You're right.

349
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:38,180
That was your first day

350
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,180
of pre-production.

351
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
You made it.

352
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Jack is back in the chamber.

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
How you feeling?

354
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
On top of the world?

355
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
I'll bet.

356
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Keep it up.

357
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,619
My budget.

358
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,619
Days to write.

359
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:50,619
I did it in one and a half days.

360
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,619
Total budget, 845.

361
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:53,619
Cool.

362
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:59,490
Jack is...

363
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:06,720
Tarantino signs on to Jeremy

364
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
French Fry's new film.

365
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,670
There's more?

366
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,670
I gotta do more of this shit?

367
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:24,779
Come on, compadre.

368
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:25,779
Wake up.

369
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,779
We already did that one.

370
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,859
I can't do it twice?

371
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:31,859
Okay.

372
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:35,400
Here.

373
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Let's just end it.

374
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:48,650
Are those darts?

375
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,869
Laura stands behind crowd

376
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:53,869
at the prison steps.

377
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:54,869
Jack walks out of the prison door

378
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,869
at the top of the steps.

379
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:57,869
He takes a deep breath

380
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:58,869
and shields his eyes from the light.

381
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,869
The crowd applauds.

382
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:07,849
So I think I just have to do them all.

383
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, why does he have a crowd?

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,160
It's good.

385
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I like it.

386
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,700
So you're halfway through

387
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,009
your writing schedule.

388
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,009
Halfway through?

389
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,009
Hope it's going well.

390
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:32,869
What do you mean halfway through?

391
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:35,900
Can that be it?

392
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:50,940
I'm running out of time.

393
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,359
Holy shit, dude.

394
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,359
You're late.

395
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,539
Let's walk.

396
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,539
Yeah, well, I don't want to be late, do I?

397
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:14,130
I did.

398
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,130
Does this matter?

399
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,130
I don't think this matters.

400
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,140
I like it.

401
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
I don't think this is the scene sequence, guys.

402
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I think this is just like

403
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
they're writing random lines.

404
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,599
I think this is just for fun.

405
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:48,440
It's starting to get annoyed.

406
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
One more day.

407
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
One more day.

408
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
That's when the real fun starts.

409
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,180
Okay, this is just a test.

410
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
We're going to do the next one for real.

411
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
It's good.

412
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:10,589
I like it.

413
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,839
A grim-faced turnkey is looking out

414
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,839
in dark prison guard.

415
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,839
Okay, sure.

416
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,839
All right, final scene coming up here.

417
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,359
Yeah, you actually have to do

418
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,359
every single one, I think.

419
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,359
We're just doing this one.

420
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,849
All of this might be for no reason.

421
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,849
I think it's just to get the scenes written down.

422
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,880
Sorry, that's it.

423
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
No time for more writing.

424
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
The studio needs you to start production now.

425
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
We'll do the best we can with what you've got.

426
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Oh, fuck.

427
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
Okay.

428
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
What?

429
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,680
I have every single scene.

430
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Finished.

431
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Assignment complete.

432
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
This script is hot.

433
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
What an edge.

434
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
What nuance.

435
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Now, get on out to production

436
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
and shoot this thing

437
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
for some two-bit hack.

438
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,680
Steals all our great ideas.

439
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,819
Okay.

440
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,789
Relations on your script.

441
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:15,789
Ooh, working title.

442
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:16,789
Now you're going to see the film

443
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:17,789
a working title.

444
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,789
Don't worry.

445
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:19,789
You can change your title

446
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:20,789
at any time back in the relations.

447
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:34,869
How about...

448
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:35,869
Because that's essentially what I did.

449
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,869
I just put the fucking script in the dryer

450
00:24:38,869 --> 00:24:41,500
and just took it out and took random pages.

451
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,869
FYI, by now, all the major papers

452
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,869
and all the online services

453
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:50,869
have read your script,

454
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,869
so you'd better do something original with it.

455
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,869
By the way, your script is now available

456
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:55,869
in all locations

457
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,869
and can be printed out in studio operations.

458
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:03,220
Okay.

459
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,420
Let's film it.

460
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:13,660
Stage 17.

461
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,930
Script.

462
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:19,930
All right.

463
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,509
What?

464
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:23,509
Are we ready?

465
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:24,509
Okay.

466
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:26,259
Your screenplay is done,

467
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,259
and it's been approved by the studio,

468
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,259
which means that now you're ready

469
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:31,259
to start production.

470
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,259
Production is tough.

471
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:34,259
You'll have to consider

472
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,259
every decision you make,

473
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:39,259
and because this is your first time,

474
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:42,259
this studio is going to be constantly

475
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:44,259
in your face on the budget and schedule.

476
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,259
Don't worry.

477
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:46,259
That happens to me too.

478
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:48,259
If you plan your shots

479
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:49,259
and you stick to your script,

480
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,259
I'm sure you're gonna do great.

481
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,259
I never start production

482
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:54,259
without first hiring

483
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,259
a brilliant director of photography.

484
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,259
Who should I hire?

485
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,259
Are you gonna give that to me

486
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,259
or do I have to do that myself?

487
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,339
Hi.

488
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:05,339
My name is Dean Cundy.

489
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,339
Some of the films I've shot

490
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,339
include Jurassic Park, Casper,

491
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:10,339
Back to the Future, and Roger Rabbit.

492
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:11,339
Wow.

493
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:12,339
One of the most challenging sequences

494
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,339
I've ever had to do was the raptor scene

495
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,339
in the kitchen for Jurassic Park.

496
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:18,339
The excitement of the storytelling

497
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:20,339
had to be told by the images,

498
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:21,339
which was greatly complicated

499
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:22,339
by the fact that the images came

500
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,339
at different times and from different places.

501
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,339
Sometimes the actors were in empty rooms,

502
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:28,339
sometimes the actors worked

503
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,339
with large mechanical dinosaurs,

504
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,339
and sometimes the dinosaurs

505
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,339
came from the computer.

506
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:35,339
And all of this had to be tied together

507
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,339
by the lighting and the camera angles.

508
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:39,339
And you're definitely not cut out for it.

509
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,339
Movies are about images.

510
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,339
Good luck, scrub.

511
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,339
And translating the director's vision

512
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,339
of the story into images is my job.

513
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:48,339
So I've read your script, very visual.

514
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:50,339
I've broken it down by moods,

515
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,339
made choices about which lights to use,

516
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:54,339
which lenses, and even what film stock is.

517
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,339
I'm gonna overstep the fuck out

518
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:56,339
of everything it says.

519
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,339
I want you to open the script

520
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,339
and click on the first scene

521
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,339
that you'd like to shoot.

522
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:00,339
Okay.

523
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:01,339
I'm gonna be like,

524
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:02,339
nah, nah, nah, nah, excuse me.

525
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:03,339
I'm gonna be like,

526
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,339
cut them off and stuff.

527
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,339
I'm gonna be the unbearable director

528
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,339
that nobody wants to work with.

529
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:09,900
All right.

530
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
In the dryer.

531
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,460
Let's film it.

532
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,660
Great place to start.

533
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
The green viewfinder shows you

534
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
where our master shot is set up.

535
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Master shot is a wide shot

536
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
that shows all the action of a scene.

537
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
As a novice,

538
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,660
you'll be shooting all master shots.

539
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Click on the green viewfinder to load your shot,

540
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
then the green camera button

541
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
down there to roll camera.

542
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
What?

543
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Okay.

544
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Remember, at the novice level,

545
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
you only have access to master shots.

546
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
After you finish this film

547
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
and move up to higher levels of play,

548
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,660
you'll have a huge array of additional shots,

549
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
including stunts, special effects, coverage,

550
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
and actor improvisations.

551
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,059
I can only film in one place?

552
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:55,390
Hi.

553
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,390
I'm Yvonne,

554
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,390
the hairdresser for your movie.

555
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,390
It's gonna take about 40 minutes

556
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,390
to get Laura ready for the movie.

557
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,390
Okay.

558
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,940
Yes, I get...

559
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
No, no, let's go.

560
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,579
I don't have time for this.

561
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:11,579
Let's shoot.

562
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:12,579
I want to shoot this now.

563
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:13,579
Let's go.

564
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,779
Hi.

565
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:16,779
I'm Yvonne,

566
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,779
the hairdresser for your movie.

567
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,779
It's gonna take about 40 minutes

568
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:19,779
to get Laura ready for the movie.

569
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:20,779
No.

570
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:21,779
No.

571
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,779
Laura's fine.

572
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:23,779
I want to shoot this right now.

573
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:24,779
Let's go.

574
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,779
How do I...

575
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:26,779
What do I...

576
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:31,930
What do I do?

577
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,930
Oh, my God.

578
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,490
He's in an electric chair.

579
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,490
Wait.

580
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,490
This is going by scene by scene.

581
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,490
Spoilers.

582
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:45,640
Hi.

583
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
I'm Yvonne,

584
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,759
the hairdresser for your movie.

585
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:51,759
It's gonna take about 40 minutes

586
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:52,759
to get Laura ready for the movie.

587
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,759
Sure.

588
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,759
You just killed that pig.

589
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:55,759
Okay.

590
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,759
Laura's ready for make-up now.

591
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,759
What do you mean by that?

592
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,140
Okay.

593
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:08,500
Laura's ready for make-up now.

594
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Okay.

595
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Laura's ready for make-up now.

596
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Okay.

597
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
I'm gonna be ready for make-up.

598
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I thought this was what you were doing.

599
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Hi.

600
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
I'm Allison,

601
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
your costume designer.

602
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,269
We shot so late last night,

603
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,269
all the costume houses were closed.

604
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,269
I didn't have the priest sizes

605
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,269
when I left here last night.

606
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,269
It's gonna be an hour.

607
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,269
Sorry.

608
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:29,269
Why is there really...

609
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,269
What are you talking about?

610
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,269
We're all waiting here.

611
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,700
Do you want to wait for the priest's costume?

612
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
No.

613
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
The priest doesn't need to be in a costume.

614
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,819
Mm-hmm.

615
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:42,819
Okay.

616
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:43,819
Got it.

617
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:44,819
They sent me on a run.

618
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:45,819
But don't worry.

619
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:46,819
I'll be there for you.

620
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:47,819
If you need me,

621
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:48,819
just click on my pager

622
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:49,819
and then drag it over to the place

623
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:51,819
where you have the question about.

624
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,819
Now, this is a special pager.

625
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:54,819
I programmed it

626
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:55,819
to give you the information

627
00:29:55,819 --> 00:29:56,819
you're looking for.

628
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:57,819
If you get lost

629
00:29:57,819 --> 00:29:58,819
or you just want to know

630
00:29:58,819 --> 00:29:59,819
how to do something faster,

631
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:01,819
click on the PA pager button.

632
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:02,819
It'll show you everything

633
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:03,819
you need to know

634
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:04,819
about the room you're in.

635
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,819
Well, that's another call.

636
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:06,819
I gotta go.

637
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:08,819
Yeah.

638
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,049
Let's go over here, then.

639
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,049
You ready?

640
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,480
All right.

641
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
We're gonna film

642
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
and then we're gonna proceed

643
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,579
first, apparently.

644
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,720
Uh, action.

645
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
This will be picture.

646
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,900
Quiet, please.

647
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Rolling.

648
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Speeding.

649
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,140
Action.

650
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Any last words?

651
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,380
Cut.

652
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,380
After you watch a shot,

653
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,450
click on the red reel button

654
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,450
down there to print it.

655
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,450
That means you'll be able

656
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,619
to take it to the editing room.

657
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:40,619
If you don't print the shot,

658
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:41,619
then you won't have it

659
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:42,619
when you get there.

660
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:43,619
If you'd like to see

661
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:44,619
the shot again,

662
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,619
click on the picture

663
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:46,619
of the camera again.

664
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,619
Once you've printed a shot,

665
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,619
the viewfinder

666
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,619
will become a screen.

667
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,619
Okay.

668
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,619
Okay.

669
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:52,619
Okay.

670
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,619
Okay.

671
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,619
The viewfinder

672
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,619
will become gray.

673
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:07,740
If you want to shoot

674
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
a new scene,

675
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
any last words?

676
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
You can either select

677
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
one from your script book

678
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
or use the scroll bar

679
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
to find the scene you want.

680
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
Okay.

681
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
So let's...

682
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,299
Cool?

683
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,299
Looks good.

684
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,299
All right.

685
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,740
What about...

686
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
Oh.

687
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
Is it another shot from here?

688
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,170
Hi.

689
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,170
I'm Allison,

690
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,170
your costume designer.

691
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,750
We shot so late last night.

692
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,750
I know.

693
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,750
All right.

694
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,750
All the costume houses

695
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,750
were closed.

696
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,750
I didn't have any presizes

697
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,750
when I left here last night.

698
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,750
It's gonna be an hour.

699
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,750
Sorry.

700
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,990
Okay.

701
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,990
We're ready in wardrobe.

702
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,990
We can go now.

703
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:49,990
Who are these fucking people?

704
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,990
These are people that apparently

705
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,990
work for the studio.

706
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,990
The paint on the electric chair

707
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:53,990
is still wet.

708
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,990
It might be really dangerous

709
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:02,160
if you try to shoot that now.

710
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,299
What?

711
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,299
Why is this shit not ready?

712
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:15,000
There's the entire production

713
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
team of people.

714
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,500
The first day of shooting is over.

715
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
You can relax now.

716
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
What?

717
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
But not for long.

718
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
It all starts again

719
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
on the second day.

720
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Here, you better take a look

721
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
at the schedule and budget.

722
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
The only thing you filmed

723
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
was any last words.

724
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,930
This is gonna be one shot

725
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,930
in the movie.

726
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,799
Fuck.

727
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,019
Okay.

728
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:41,019
Here we go.

729
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

730
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
Pull it back.

731
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,190
Back, back, back.

732
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,190
Pull it back.

733
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,930
I want this back.

734
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,930
$150,000 for that.

735
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,930
All right.

736
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,930
Let's go.

737
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:55,930
Scene four.

738
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:21,279
Did I just film this again?

739
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,279
Was it the same thing twice?

740
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,450
Print it.

741
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,450
Print it.

742
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,450
Okay.

743
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:39,579
Now we have the two guys sleeping.

744
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,579
Budget.

745
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh, I'm at $300,000 for that.

746
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
All right.

747
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
Action.

748
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,329
Very quiet, please.

749
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,079
Speed on tape.

750
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:56,730
And action.

751
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,730
The scene.

752
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,730
Ravenswood Prison.

753
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Behind these cold stone walls,

754
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,480
Jack Cavello eats his last meal.

755
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Here's his last rice.

756
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
And at $12,000,

757
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
and at 12 noon,

758
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
we'll walk that long last mile

759
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,480
to the electric chair.

760
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
The world was shocked

761
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
when it learned of the brutal slaying

762
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
of heiress Victoria Hemmerdinger.

763
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
The killer's motive,

764
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,780
theft of her famed jewelry collection,

765
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
including the spectacular

766
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Diamond Tiara Del Fuego.

767
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
Her trusted chauffeur,

768
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
Jack Cavello,

769
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,780
was arrested and convicted,

770
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,780
but the jewels were never recovered.

771
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,409
Instrumentals captured

772
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,409
were Sigmund Payne and Leroy Terror.

773
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,409
Magicians, escape artists,

774
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,409
and personal psychics

775
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,409
to Mrs. Hemmerdinger.

776
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,409
That's Penn and Teller.

777
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,409
It was they who led police

778
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,409
to the murder weapon.

779
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,409
A pearl-haired saber

780
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,409
bound in the trunk of Cavello's car.

781
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
I don't want...

782
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Okay, we'll print it.

783
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Print.

784
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,559
All right, is the paint dry yet?

785
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,679
The paint on the electric chair

786
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,679
is still wet.

787
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,679
It might be really dangerous

788
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,679
if you try to shoot that now.

789
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:12,679
Well, why the fuck did you paint

790
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,679
the electric chair?

791
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,679
It's wood.

792
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,679
It's made out of wood.

793
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,679
It's made out of wood.

794
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,679
Why would you paint it?

795
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:29,619
And the dryer faces stiff delays.

796
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:33,980
Okay, the paint's dry.

797
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
You can shoot now.

798
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
We delayed the movie

799
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
for paint to dry.

800
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
You've gone through

801
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
half your scheduled time.

802
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Plan carefully for the rest

803
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
of the filming.

804
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Are you fucking kidding me?

805
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:50,210
Let's go.

806
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,019
Stand by for picture.

807
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,579
Roll sound.

808
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:56,579
Speed.

809
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,579
Action.

810
00:35:58,579 --> 00:35:59,579
What it came to pass

811
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,579
from the training town toward heaven

812
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:14,340
This is so bad.

813
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,340
I can't do any cuts.

814
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,800
I have to do long, wide shots.

815
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
This movie sucks.

816
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Total ass.

817
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:33,739
I want to do cuts.

818
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:34,739
I want to do close-ups.

819
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,739
I want to do other angles.

820
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,739
I don't want to just do this one.

821
00:36:39,739 --> 00:37:06,949
Print.

822
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:10,539
You do the cuts in post.

823
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:11,539
Well, if I don't film them,

824
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:12,539
how do I do cuts?

825
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,539
All right, I'm almost out of time here.

826
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:16,539
What are the other scenes?

827
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:24,500
There's a priest coming down.

828
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
All right, this is the walk.

829
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,820
Let's get this one here

830
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
with the grandma.

831
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,219
There's paint on the bars.

832
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,219
Hi, I'm Yvonne.

833
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,219
I'm your hairdresser for the movie.

834
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,219
It's going to take about

835
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:39,219
20 minutes to get Ma ready.

836
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:42,219
Why is Ma wearing a wig?

837
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,710
Why can't you just use

838
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,710
Ma's real hair?

839
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:53,989
Hi, I'm Yvonne.

840
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:55,989
I'm your hairdresser for the movie.

841
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:56,989
It's going to take about

842
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:58,989
20 minutes to get Ma ready.

843
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:03,019
All right, 20 minutes.

844
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,019
Delay the movie because

845
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,570
somebody needs to put a wig on.

846
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,639
Okay, Ma's ready to go

847
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,639
into makeup now.

848
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,639
All right, let's go.

849
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,139
Why would you...

850
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:20,079
It's six days to shoot a whole movie.

851
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,079
Doesn't it usually take like

852
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,079
three months to shoot a whole movie?

853
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,079
Roll sound.

854
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,840
Sound speed.

855
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,840
Action.

856
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:41,739
Clinic.

857
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:47,119
You need to speak up.

858
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,900
What?

859
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,800
You late to your own execution?

860
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:02,159
This will be picture.

861
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,159
Quiet, please.

862
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,159
Rolling.

863
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,639
Speeding.

864
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,820
Action.

865
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
The Lord is my shepherd.

866
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:16,320
He made me lie down in green pastures

867
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,199
to restore my soul.

868
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,199
Yea, for I walk through the valley

869
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,199
of the shadows of death.

870
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,199
I fear no evil,

871
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,500
for Thou art with me.

872
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,940
Surely goodness and mercy

873
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,940
shall follow me

874
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
all the days of my life,

875
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,940
and I will rarely come out

876
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
to the Lord forever.

877
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Cut.

878
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Okay.

879
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,940
One more day.

880
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,940
That's all that's left.

881
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Make sure you've got everything you need.

882
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,139
All right, we got one more scene to shoot.

883
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,139
Print it.

884
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,139
Print.

885
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,639
All right, now can I get

886
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
this scene shot over here?

887
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:03,269
Not Ma's wig.

888
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,829
The one that I couldn't do

889
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:05,829
in the very beginning.

890
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:07,070
This one.

891
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,070
All right, right here.

892
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,070
Let's go.

893
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,900
Roll it.

894
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Quiet on the set.

895
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,139
And rolling.

896
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,139
Sound speed.

897
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:21,139
Action.

898
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:27,219
Why is he...

899
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,219
Why is it like...

900
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:29,219
Why...

901
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,219
What?

902
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,219
Why is he smoking?

903
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:33,219
Why is it dry ice all over?

904
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,900
What?

905
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,739
Jennifer Aniston's in the movie

906
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,739
for one take.

907
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,570
That's it.

908
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,280
She's a reaction shot.

909
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
That's it.

910
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
I can still do another one.

911
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,500
He's in the dryer.

912
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,260
Steaming from the dryer.

913
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
You're kind of between

914
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
a rock and a hard place.

915
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
You've used up all your time

916
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
in production,

917
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
so if you want to continue shooting,

918
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
you'll have to trade for time

919
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260
in post-production.

920
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,260
No, I don't give a shit.

921
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,260
That means less time for editing,

922
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
sound effects...

923
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
No, I want to edit

924
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
and put sound effects in.

925
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I want to put like clowns like...

926
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Who's going to be fucking funny?

927
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:44,010
Uh, no, no, no, no.

928
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,010
I'll go with what I have.

929
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,400
Let's go.

930
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:57,809
All right, I'm good.

931
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:58,809
Let's do it.

932
00:41:58,809 --> 00:41:59,809
Look back to editing.

933
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:05,530
Editing.

934
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,239
All right.

935
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm prepared for this.

936
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
I'm prepared for this.

937
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:23,039
We're using actual fucking discs today.

938
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:30,099
You didn't think

939
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,099
I came fucking prepared, did you?

940
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,460
Uh-oh.

941
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:46,619
You didn't think

942
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:47,619
I came prepared today.

943
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:48,619
You didn't think

944
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:49,619
I fucking got a virtual machine

945
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:50,619
running Windows 3.1.

946
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,980
You don't think I fucking got that?

947
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
There's an old Hollywood saying

948
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
that all great movies

949
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
are made in the editing room.

950
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
You're going to take the footage

951
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
that you've shot

952
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,980
and you're going to assemble it.

953
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
Editing is about making choices

954
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,980
without all the pressure

955
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
of physical production.

956
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,980
You and your film editor

957
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,980
will be looking for

958
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,980
the most original way

959
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,980
to tell your story.

960
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:12,980
This is a time

961
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,980
for making decisions like

962
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
faster or slower,

963
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,980
funnier or scarier,

964
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,980
longer or shorter.

965
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
Funny or serious?

966
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,980
And this is the place

967
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,980
where the director

968
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,980
has the most control.

969
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,980
And for me personally,

970
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,980
where I have the most fun.

971
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,159
Hi, I'm Michael Cahn.

972
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:29,159
And a few of the films I've...

973
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,159
You might know me

974
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,159
as doing way cooler shit

975
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,159
than you will ever do

976
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,159
in your whole life.

977
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:34,159
Editing is always fun.

978
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,159
By the way, let's now talk

979
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,159
about what you have to do.

980
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:37,159
It's a new challenge.

981
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,159
While editing Schindler's List

982
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,159
and Crackout Poland,

983
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,159
we were also finishing

984
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,159
Jurassic Park.

985
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,159
We used a satellite transmission

986
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,159
from the visual effects company

987
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,159
in Northern California

988
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,159
so that Stephen could view

989
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,159
and approve the dinosaur footage.

990
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,159
But even with all this

991
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,159
technical wizardry,

992
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,159
we never lost sight

993
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:54,159
of the importance

994
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,159
of telling the story.

995
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,159
This is the editing room

996
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,159
where you'll be creating

997
00:43:58,159 --> 00:43:59,159
your own story.

998
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,159
The first step

999
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,159
of editing any movie

1000
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,159
is to view all of your footage.

1001
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,159
Your PA will show you

1002
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,159
around the flatbed.

1003
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,159
You know, that might be

1004
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:08,159
my favorite stream moment

1005
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,159
in the last six months.

1006
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,159
The editing process

1007
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,159
can be fairly complicated,

1008
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,159
so I'm going to go through it

1009
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,159
step by step.

1010
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,159
But before I show you

1011
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:16,159
how to start editing,

1012
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,159
I should probably take you

1013
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,159
on a quick tour

1014
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,159
of the editing bay.

1015
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,159
By the way,

1016
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,159
I'm in control now.

1017
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,159
Your mouse isn't broken.

1018
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,159
You'll be working

1019
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:25,159
with two decks.

1020
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:26,159
The one on the left,

1021
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:27,159
deck one,

1022
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:28,159
is your selection deck.

1023
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,159
That's where we'll be

1024
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,159
loading up

1025
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:31,159
each of the shots

1026
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,159
that you printed

1027
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:33,159
during production,

1028
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,159
so you can clip out

1029
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,159
the parts of the shot

1030
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:36,159
you want to use in your film.

1031
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:37,159
On the right is

1032
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,159
your assembly deck.

1033
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:39,159
That's where we'll put together

1034
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,159
the edited shots

1035
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,159
to make them move.

1036
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:42,159
I have to fucking pay attention.

1037
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,159
Both of these decks

1038
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:44,159
are controlled

1039
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,159
by the single control panel

1040
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:46,159
in the middle of your screen.

1041
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,159
You can tell which deck

1042
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,159
is being controlled

1043
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,159
by the panel

1044
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,159
because the light

1045
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,159
on top of that deck's monitor

1046
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,159
will light up.

1047
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,159
I'm going to go ahead

1048
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,159
and load one of your shots

1049
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,159
into the selection deck

1050
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,159
so I can show you

1051
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,159
how the control panel works

1052
00:44:57,159 --> 00:44:58,159
and how to make it

1053
00:44:58,159 --> 00:44:59,159
all edit.

1054
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,230
The first thing you need to do

1055
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,230
is click on the script

1056
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,230
and then click on the scene

1057
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,230
that you want to start with.

1058
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:08,690
Okay.

1059
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,079
Use the still frames

1060
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,079
at the top of your screen

1061
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,079
to select which shot

1062
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,079
from production

1063
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
you'd like to start editing.

1064
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,079
The master shot is always

1065
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,079
automatically loaded

1066
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,079
into the selection deck

1067
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,079
to the left.

1068
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,079
If it isn't the shot

1069
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,079
that you want to start with,

1070
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
you can load another shot

1071
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,079
by clicking on one

1072
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,079
of the other still shots

1073
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,079
at the top of the screen

1074
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,079
or by selecting

1075
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,079
a different scene

1076
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:31,079
from your script.

1077
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:32,079
Okay.

1078
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,079
Now that we have a shot loaded,

1079
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:34,079
you'll need to find

1080
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,079
where to begin your story.

1081
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:37,079
To do this,

1082
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,079
we need to use the buttons

1083
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,079
on the control panel.

1084
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:41,579
The first button to start with

1085
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:42,579
is the play button.

1086
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,579
This will play the shot

1087
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,579
on the selection deck

1088
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,579
until we tell it to stop

1089
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,579
by hitting the play button

1090
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,579
a second time.

1091
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:54,679
If we already know

1092
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:55,679
where to start our edit,

1093
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:56,679
use the fast forward button

1094
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:57,679
to find the place

1095
00:45:57,679 --> 00:45:59,679
where we want to be.

1096
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,710
If we're very close

1097
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:03,710
to the start of our edit,

1098
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,710
we can use the step forward

1099
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:05,710
button to go ahead

1100
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,710
one frame at a time.

1101
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,710
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1102
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,710
The three rewind buttons

1103
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,710
on the left side

1104
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,710
of the control panel

1105
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,710
work just like the forward buttons,

1106
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,710
except they play

1107
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,710
your shot backwards.

1108
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:22,369
Once I've found the frame

1109
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:24,369
where I want to start my edit,

1110
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:25,369
I have to mark that spot

1111
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:26,369
on the film.

1112
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,369
To do this,

1113
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:28,369
I'll use the mark button

1114
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,369
on the control panel.

1115
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,369
This will turn the cursor

1116
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:31,369
into a clip

1117
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:32,369
that I can then clip

1118
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:33,369
onto the film

1119
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:34,369
so I'll remember

1120
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:35,369
where my edit begins.

1121
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:37,369
This is called the end point.

1122
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:39,369
Now that I've marked my end point,

1123
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,369
I need to find the frame

1124
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,369
where I want the edit to end,

1125
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,369
called the out point.

1126
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:45,369
I'll do this using the play

1127
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,369
and rewind buttons

1128
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:47,369
on the control panel,

1129
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,369
just like I did

1130
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:49,369
to find the end point.

1131
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,369
Yeah.

1132
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:54,119
We want it to be right there.

1133
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,679
I can't get over it.

1134
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,679
I'm sorry.

1135
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:57,679
I'm having trouble

1136
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,969
getting over that.

1137
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:01,969
The mark button

1138
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:02,969
on the control panel

1139
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:03,969
turned into a cut button

1140
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:04,969
once I marked my end point.

1141
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:05,969
That's to remind me

1142
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:06,969
that my end point

1143
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:07,969
has been set,

1144
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:08,969
and the next frame I mark

1145
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:09,969
will be my out point.

1146
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:10,969
I'll click on the cut button

1147
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:11,969
to select the end of my edit.

1148
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:12,969
This time the cursor

1149
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,969
will turn into a pair of scissors.

1150
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:16,969
Cut it.

1151
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:17,969
Now that I've marked

1152
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,139
my in and out points

1153
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,139
on the selection deck,

1154
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,139
the cut is made

1155
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,139
and the cursor becomes

1156
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,139
a piece of film.

1157
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:24,139
If I like this edit,

1158
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,139
I can put this clip

1159
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:26,139
on my assembly deck

1160
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:27,139
to make it a part

1161
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,139
of my edited movie.

1162
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:29,139
Or if I don't like it,

1163
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:30,139
I can throw it away

1164
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,139
in the trash can to the right.

1165
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,139
All right.

1166
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,139
So that's the movie over here.

1167
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:35,139
This is the actual movie

1168
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:36,139
on the right side.

1169
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,139
The clip I just edited

1170
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:38,139
is now loaded

1171
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:39,139
on the assembly deck.

1172
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:40,139
The last frame of the clip

1173
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:42,139
I just cut is on the monitor.

1174
00:47:42,139 --> 00:47:43,139
The assembly deck is active

1175
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:44,139
and is being controlled

1176
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:46,139
by the control panel.

1177
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,139
If I'm not sure

1178
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,139
about what I've edited,

1179
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:49,139
I can use the rewind

1180
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:50,139
and play buttons

1181
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,139
to take a look.

1182
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:52,139
If I want to trim

1183
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,139
a little bit more off

1184
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,139
this edited clip

1185
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,139
and throw it away,

1186
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,139
I can use the mark

1187
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,139
and cut buttons

1188
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:58,139
just as I did

1189
00:47:58,139 --> 00:47:59,139
on the left deck.

1190
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:00,139
The assembly deck

1191
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,510
has another added feature.

1192
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,510
The scroll bar

1193
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,510
below the monitor

1194
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,510
lets you jump through

1195
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,510
the different cuts

1196
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,510
in your movie,

1197
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,510
just like the scroll bar

1198
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,510
in production

1199
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:10,510
let you jump through

1200
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,510
the different scenes

1201
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,510
in your script.

1202
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,510
Now that the first edit

1203
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,510
has been made,

1204
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:15,510
you'll want to go back

1205
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,510
to your script

1206
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,510
and load up the next shot

1207
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:18,510
and add that to your movie.

1208
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,510
To do this,

1209
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,510
you'll go through

1210
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:21,510
the same process

1211
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,510
that we went through

1212
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,510
for the first one.

1213
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:25,510
I know this sounds complicated,

1214
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,510
but don't worry about it.

1215
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,510
Look at the hang of it

1216
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,510
after you've made

1217
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,510
a couple of edits.

1218
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,510
Then you'll just be

1219
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,510
flying through the footage.

1220
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,510
You've still got my pager

1221
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,510
if you want to get more help

1222
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,510
on the buttons

1223
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:35,510
or other items in the room.

1224
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,510
It's like you can also

1225
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,510
take your tutorials again

1226
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,510
if you want.

1227
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,510
Just click on the

1228
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,510
PA Pager button

1229
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,510
and then the

1230
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:42,510
replay tutorial button

1231
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,510
on the help screen.

1232
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,510
Okay, I'll clean up

1233
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:45,510
this mess I made

1234
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,510
so you can

1235
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:47,510
put together

1236
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,510
your movie.

1237
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,510
Good luck and

1238
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,510
don't forget

1239
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,510
that you're still

1240
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,510
working under a budget

1241
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,510
and a schedule.

1242
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,510
A schedule, okay.

1243
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,510
I thought you were going

1244
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,519
to clean this shit up.

1245
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:58,519
Oh, okay.

1246
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,909
All right, here we go.

1247
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:01,909
So we've got

1248
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:02,909
interior, chamber.

1249
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:03,909
Here we go.

1250
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:04,909
Jack is brought

1251
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,429
into the chamber.

1252
00:49:07,429 --> 00:49:08,429
Now, if this isn't

1253
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:11,909
the scene you'd like

1254
00:49:11,909 --> 00:49:12,909
to start with,

1255
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,150
go back to your script

1256
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,030
and pick another.

1257
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,030
Get away from me.

1258
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,030
Otherwise, let's get

1259
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,030
to work on this one.

1260
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,030
Why are you paging me

1261
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,030
for this?

1262
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,030
Okay.

1263
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,030
You double-paged me.

1264
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,030
The best thing to do

1265
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,030
is watch this shot

1266
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,030
to see exactly

1267
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,030
where you want to

1268
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,030
make your cut.

1269
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,030
I know.

1270
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,030
To do this,

1271
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,030
hit the play button.

1272
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,030
If you want to stop,

1273
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,030
hit the play button.

1274
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,030
I was a goddamn YouTuber.

1275
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,030
That goes for all

1276
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,030
the other buttons too.

1277
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,030
Do you see my edits?

1278
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,030
Once you go,

1279
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,030
again to stop.

1280
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,030
When you decide

1281
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,030
to start your cut.

1282
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,030
I cut 40 times

1283
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,030
in a tenth of a second.

1284
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,030
Nobody even knew

1285
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,030
I did it.

1286
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,030
Up to the film on the left.

1287
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,030
I'm a cut master.

1288
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,030
It will set your end point.

1289
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,030
That's where you'll

1290
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,030
start your edit.

1291
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,030
It was like

1292
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,030
you didn't even know

1293
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,030
what happened.

1294
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,030
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

1295
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,360
There we go.

1296
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,360
So I want to start.

1297
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,750
It came too fast.

1298
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,750
Wait.

1299
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,750
Back it up.

1300
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,039
End point.

1301
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:07,340
Right here.

1302
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,860
Bingo.

1303
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:13,920
Now that you've

1304
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
marked your end point,

1305
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,989
play through the shot

1306
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:17,989
to find where you

1307
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:18,989
want to end it.

1308
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:19,989
Once you find

1309
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:20,989
a good spot,

1310
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:21,989
stop the deck.

1311
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:22,989
Pick up the scissors

1312
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:23,989
and use them

1313
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:24,989
on the film

1314
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:25,989
on the left deck.

1315
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:26,989
After clicking

1316
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:27,989
the scissors,

1317
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:28,989
you should see

1318
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:29,989
a piece of film

1319
00:50:29,989 --> 00:50:30,989
in your hand.

1320
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:31,989
That's your cut.

1321
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:32,989
Drag it over

1322
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:33,989
to the assembly deck,

1323
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:34,989
the one on the right,

1324
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:35,989
and click it.

1325
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:36,989
They really, really

1326
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:37,989
were concerned

1327
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:38,989
that nobody

1328
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:39,989
was going to get this shit.

1329
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,809
They were so scared

1330
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:42,809
that nobody was going

1331
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:43,809
to fucking understand

1332
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:44,809
how to do this at all.

1333
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:45,809
Done.

1334
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,809
Got it.

1335
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:49,329
Bingo.

1336
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:58,250
Cut it.

1337
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,250
Great.

1338
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:07,340
You've gotten the hang of it.

1339
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,340
I told you it was easy.

1340
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Now select another shot

1341
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,340
to follow this one

1342
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,340
and follow the same process

1343
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,340
you did the first time.

1344
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,340
I'm going to re-

1345
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,340
Each new clip will follow

1346
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,340
the frame being

1347
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,340
displayed on that monitor.

1348
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,340
Okay.

1349
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
So let's go.

1350
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,340
New scene.

1351
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,019
Here we go.

1352
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:22,019
That's them.

1353
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:23,019
Okay.

1354
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,019
Bring them in.

1355
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,460
Next scene.

1356
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,460
News process.

1357
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,460
No.

1358
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,460
I don't even want that

1359
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:41,860
in the movie.

1360
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,860
Okay.

1361
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,860
I talked to Laura.

1362
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:57,769
She's that...

1363
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:58,769
No, no, no.

1364
00:51:58,769 --> 00:51:59,769
Get back.

1365
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:00,769
No.

1366
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:06,659
Get back.

1367
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:07,659
No, no, no.

1368
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:13,579
Back, back, back, back.

1369
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:14,579
Jack and Father eggs at the cell.

1370
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:21,000
How do I-

1371
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Okay.

1372
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,480
That's how you go back.

1373
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,480
There we go.

1374
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,619
This is what I want.

1375
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:29,619
No.

1376
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:30,619
I don't want that actually.

1377
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:35,570
There it is.

1378
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,570
Okay.

1379
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,570
Here it is.

1380
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,570
I was looking for that.

1381
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:44,030
Any last words?

1382
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:54,489
Any last words?

1383
00:52:54,489 --> 00:52:55,489
Why is it filming

1384
00:52:55,489 --> 00:53:03,699
the whole thing?

1385
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:05,710
Back to the beginning.

1386
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:06,710
All right.

1387
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,190
In point here.

1388
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,190
Any last words?

1389
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:19,199
Cut it.

1390
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,739
Bingo.

1391
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:25,650
Did I just fuck that up?

1392
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,650
No.

1393
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,650
No.

1394
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:31,769
Okay.

1395
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:43,239
Any last words?

1396
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:48,260
Okay.

1397
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,260
Now...

1398
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,260
Hold on.

1399
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,820
No, no, no, no, no.

1400
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,820
Now I need...

1401
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,949
No.

1402
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:55,949
I need the kiss.

1403
00:53:55,949 --> 00:54:01,289
Can I put this

1404
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:04,059
in the beginning of the movie?

1405
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:05,059
How do I put this

1406
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:12,500
in the beginning of the movie?

1407
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
I want it back here.

1408
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:20,440
You know what I mean?

1409
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:35,800
I want to put this here.

1410
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:42,739
Okay.

1411
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:50,820
That's fine.

1412
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,820
I want this to happen

1413
00:54:51,820 --> 00:55:03,559
in the beginning.

1414
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:13,500
Hold on.

1415
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,420
I want to change the point.

1416
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,420
I want to change

1417
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,420
the edit point.

1418
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,420
I want this to happen

1419
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,909
to be this.

1420
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:31,909
No.

1421
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:32,909
Trash it.

1422
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:45,860
Trash it.

1423
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,960
Trash.

1424
00:55:58,219 --> 00:55:59,219
No.

1425
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:00,219
Why is this here?

1426
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:01,219
There we go.

1427
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:13,860
Okay.

1428
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:23,800
Hold on.

1429
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,800
This is fucking...

1430
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,489
This is memento.

1431
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:27,489
No.

1432
00:56:27,489 --> 00:56:28,489
That's it.

1433
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:29,489
Fuck.

1434
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:43,909
First day in the editing room

1435
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:44,909
is always terrible.

1436
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:45,909
What?

1437
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,670
Don't worry.

1438
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:52,000
Everything looks great.

1439
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh shit.

1440
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I don't have

1441
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
very much money left.

1442
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,989
Wait.

1443
00:56:58,989 --> 00:56:59,989
Is this two back-to-back kissing...

1444
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:15,139
Is this two back-to-back kissing scenes?

1445
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:19,300
Just make the whole thing

1446
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:24,619
different cuts of kissing.

1447
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:25,619
I want more...

1448
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:33,159
I need more time.

1449
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,400
I'm running out of time,

1450
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,400
so I have to go to the end here

1451
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,400
and I have to put...

1452
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,400
I got to put...

1453
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
I'm coming out.

1454
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
They didn't give me enough money.

1455
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:52,860
Where is it?

1456
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:05,070
Where the fuck is it?

1457
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,070
Where is him coming out of the dryer?

1458
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:57,179
Is there enough time?

1459
00:58:57,179 --> 00:58:58,179
Can I do another one?

1460
00:58:58,179 --> 00:59:23,360
I wish I could get a bigger picture of this shit.

1461
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,360
It's red, right?

1462
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Where is it?

1463
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,519
If I can fit another big kiss scene,

1464
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:36,340
I'm going to do it.

1465
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,340
Wait.

1466
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,340
No, that's Kiss's forehead.

1467
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:44,130
There it is.

1468
00:59:44,130 --> 01:00:05,340
Right there.

1469
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
I still have to add sound effects and shit.

1470
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:20,750
How much more can I do with this?

1471
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,869
Why is the studio letting me do this?

1472
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:33,829
I thought that...

1473
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:34,829
I thought I had...

1474
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:35,829
I thought I was out of money.

1475
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:50,449
Am I out of money?

1476
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:51,449
Where's my budget?

1477
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:55,099
No, I'm not out of money yet.

1478
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:57,809
Okay.

1479
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:00,329
I think that's good

1480
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:01,329
because I need to...

1481
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:02,329
I need to put music in and shit.

1482
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:13,230
I need money for that.

1483
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,230
Can you put in reversed clips?

1484
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:20,630
I don't think so.

1485
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,630
So do I...

1486
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:26,710
Is that it?

1487
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,710
Can I leave here with this done

1488
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:31,039
or do I have to put this somewhere?

1489
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:32,039
Do I slam dunk it?

1490
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:41,469
Have there be two dryer scenes?

1491
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,469
No, that's...

1492
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,469
I can't do that.

1493
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:49,900
What do I got for days left?

1494
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,519
Total days.

1495
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:52,519
Days to edit.

1496
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:53,519
Three.

1497
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:54,519
Okay.

1498
01:01:54,519 --> 01:02:03,820
No, no.

1499
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,820
That's what it is.

1500
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,820
Wait, you guys want to bring out

1501
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,820
more than two or three people?

1502
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:19,429
No.

1503
01:02:19,429 --> 01:02:20,429
No, no.

1504
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:21,429
We need the you're late.

1505
01:02:21,429 --> 01:02:28,840
I need the you're late.

1506
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
That happens right here.

1507
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:41,889
And he's late because he spent so much time

1508
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:42,889
kissing his girlfriend.

1509
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:47,840
Okay.

1510
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:55,099
Where is it?

1511
01:02:55,099 --> 01:02:56,099
You're late.

1512
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,099
You're late.

1513
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:58,099
You're late.

1514
01:02:58,099 --> 01:02:59,099
You're late.

1515
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:00,980
You're late.

1516
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,980
Not the broadcast.

1517
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,980
You're late.

1518
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:03,980
Here it is.

1519
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:30,429
You're late.

1520
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:31,429
Let's walk.

1521
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:35,699
Well, I don't want to be late now, do I?

1522
01:03:35,699 --> 01:03:36,699
Mom?

1523
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:45,309
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1524
01:03:45,309 --> 01:03:48,309
I have to.

1525
01:03:48,309 --> 01:04:03,500
I have to do it.

1526
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,500
You don't tell me I can't do it

1527
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,809
because I'm going to do it.

1528
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:08,809
You only have a day left to finish up.

1529
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:09,809
This is plenty of time.

1530
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:10,809
Take care of any loose ends

1531
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:12,809
and nail this thing down.

1532
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:18,070
Check the budget one last time.

1533
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:20,070
Hold on.

1534
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:27,460
Mom?

1535
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:30,019
I guess this is goodbye.

1536
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,300
Mom?

1537
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,989
I have to fucking focus here.

1538
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:55,449
Now, do I?

1539
01:04:55,449 --> 01:04:56,619
Mom?

1540
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:57,619
Right.

1541
01:04:57,619 --> 01:04:58,619
Mom?

1542
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:14,239
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

1543
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:58,400
I can't be stopped.

1544
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,579
I can't be stopped.

1545
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:00,579
Oh shit.

1546
01:06:00,579 --> 01:06:03,929
Am I?

1547
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:04,929
Well, that's it.

1548
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:07,230
It's been a pleasure working with you.

1549
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,599
Now, head upstairs to the foley stage

1550
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,599
and start creating your sound effects.

1551
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,860
No!

1552
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:20,670
Okay, I got one more.

1553
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:36,949
Mom?

1554
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:43,909
I guess this is goodbye.

1555
01:06:50,179 --> 01:07:16,699
Any last words?

1556
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:26,519
Okay, we have to go and edit.

1557
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:31,420
So, I now take this masterpiece.

1558
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,940
Oh my God.

1559
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:35,940
My fucking head.

1560
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,550
We go to the sound bay.

1561
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:52,889
Jesus fucking God.

1562
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:57,349
Sound effects.

1563
01:07:57,349 --> 01:08:02,699
Please wait while the foley artists prepare the studio.

1564
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:13,889
What the fuck?

1565
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,060
Okay, I thought he had a gun.

1566
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,060
Now comes the part of filmmaking that's always fun.

1567
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,060
I looked over at you guys.

1568
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,060
You brought your edited film into the foley studio

1569
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,060
where you're going to work with the sound designer, Mark,

1570
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,060
to add sound effects.

1571
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,119
Hey, those are all my achievements.

1572
01:08:32,119 --> 01:08:35,260
I was nominated for five Grammys.

1573
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,260
I'm a sound designer.

1574
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,260
We're here on the foley stage,

1575
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:41,260
which is where we create sound effects for movies.

1576
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:44,260
Some of the movies I've designed sound for are The Flintstones,

1577
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,260
three of the Star Trek movies, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.

1578
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,260
When it sounds like it's raining in a movie,

1579
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:56,260
or it sounds like you're in the middle of a tropical rain forest,

1580
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:01,359
those sounds were put together by people like me.

1581
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,539
One of the most fun parts of designing sound for movies

1582
01:09:04,539 --> 01:09:07,539
is getting to create sounds that don't exist in real life.

1583
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:09,710
So, for example, on Aladdin,

1584
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,710
to create the sound of Aladdin being chased by a tidal wave of lava,

1585
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,710
I recorded the sound of my mother's spaghetti sauce

1586
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,710
simmering on the stove.

1587
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,710
Your PA will now show you how to lay in sound effects.

1588
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:25,890
That was very clearly you putting your mouth around a straw

1589
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,890
with milk and blowing bubbles.

1590
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,890
It would have been easier that way.

1591
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,890
Clicking on the record button, followed by the play button,

1592
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,890
then clicking on the appropriate prop at the right time.

1593
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,890
It might take some practice, but just remember

1594
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,890
that you can erase sounds by doing the same process,

1595
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,890
but hitting the mute button instead of a prop.

1596
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,729
Record button and play button, hold on though.

1597
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:55,539
Let's just wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1598
01:09:55,539 --> 01:10:09,909
I want to see, I need to see if this is going to work.

1599
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:14,140
What are these sounds?

1600
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,140
Oh God, that's fucking loud, okay.

1601
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:30,140
Ah, ow, my, that, I actually just got, I think I hurt myself.

1602
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:46,500
I really did, I just hurt myself.

1603
01:10:46,500 --> 01:11:00,359
Shit, no, how do I, how do I remove a sound?

1604
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:04,970
How do you remove a sound?

1605
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:12,350
Undo, is this undo?

1606
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:44,739
What, are you talking?

1607
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:48,989
What did he say?

1608
01:11:48,989 --> 01:12:02,939
I don't hear any sound effect though.

1609
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:05,310
It should be right like here, right?

1610
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,310
So why is it not playing?

1611
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,869
What the fuck was that?

1612
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:23,149
What?

1613
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:24,149
Yeah, why is it muted?

1614
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:34,590
But record and then play, record, play.

1615
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:38,789
Any last words?

1616
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:58,989
Everyone has to applaud this.

1617
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:36,520
No, no, no, no, I'm not going to do that.

1618
01:13:36,520 --> 01:14:33,340
I need to see what the other ones do.

1619
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,340
Ah, something's wrong with me.

1620
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:40,340
My like right, lower right side of my stomach is killing, it's like a knife going into it when I laugh.

1621
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,340
What the fuck is wrong with me?

1622
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,340
I think I pulled a muscle laughing at this shit.

1623
01:14:45,340 --> 01:15:01,140
Ah, is there an, did anybody like bend over or anything?

1624
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:11,680
Uh oh, we've lost audio on the help.

1625
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:17,159
$819,000.

1626
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:24,890
What is this?

1627
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:30,460
You know, I got to do it.

1628
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:31,460
Do you know what I mean?

1629
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,460
I have to do it.

1630
01:15:32,460 --> 01:16:09,659
Print it.

1631
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:10,659
Let's go.

1632
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:11,659
That's it.

1633
01:16:11,659 --> 01:16:13,420
I did it.

1634
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,420
Movie over.

1635
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:17,130
Movie done.

1636
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,130
Add the shotgun?

1637
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,130
No, that's too much.

1638
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:20,130
It's overkill.

1639
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:32,380
I know where I can put that.

1640
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:39,100
I'm almost out of budget.

1641
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:56,979
Last day.

1642
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,979
He's like, he bites off her ear and then starts kissing her.

1643
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:02,979
No, no, no, no, it's too much.

1644
01:17:02,979 --> 01:17:03,979
It's too comedy, too much comedy.

1645
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:04,979
No, too much.

1646
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:07,600
That's too, that's over comedy.

1647
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,600
I'm not going to over comedy this.

1648
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:22,850
No, that's over comedy.

1649
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:23,850
I'm done.

1650
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:26,729
That's, that's comedy overload.

1651
01:17:26,729 --> 01:17:34,239
Done.

1652
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:35,239
No, I can't.

1653
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,239
I've got to get out.

1654
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:41,380
I will over comedy the fuck out of that and I don't want to.

1655
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,380
Graphics?

1656
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:56,010
This is the room where you'll create the marketing campaign for your film.

1657
01:17:56,010 --> 01:18:00,010
You'll have the opportunity here to create advertising that will communicate to people

1658
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:04,010
all over the world the reasons they should go out and pay to see your movie.

1659
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:11,010
If your movie doesn't open to big audiences, you get to blame all the people in this room.

1660
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,909
Okay.

1661
01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:18,909
Most people think that once a film is finished, the movie making process is complete.

1662
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:21,909
In fact, there's quite a bit more to it.

1663
01:18:21,909 --> 01:18:22,909
Hi, I'm Buffy Shutt.

1664
01:18:22,909 --> 01:18:24,909
I run the marketing department.

1665
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:29,909
Our group designs the posters and ads that you see in newspapers, on buses,

1666
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:31,909
and at your local movie theater.

1667
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:38,909
I've created marketing campaigns for such films as Babe, Apollo 13, Casper, and T2.

1668
01:18:38,909 --> 01:18:43,909
When we envision a campaign, we often find the key to it is in a music cue,

1669
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:46,909
a single image, or a line from the script.

1670
01:18:46,909 --> 01:18:47,909
I can't wait to make the poster.

1671
01:18:47,909 --> 01:18:48,909
Good lines sell the movie.

1672
01:18:48,909 --> 01:18:51,909
Great lines become part of our vocabulary.

1673
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:54,909
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

1674
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:57,909
Houston, we have a problem.

1675
01:18:57,909 --> 01:18:59,909
I'll be back.

1676
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:02,909
Let's see if we can come up with something unique for your film.

1677
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:03,909
Oh, oh.

1678
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:06,909
Click on the poster maker, title vision, or the ticomatic,

1679
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,909
and your PA will show you how to create your film.

1680
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:10,909
Poster maker.

1681
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:12,149
I gotta get a good poster.

1682
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:17,149
I'll bet you're sitting there with your stomach in knots, terrified no one's gonna like your movie.

1683
01:19:17,149 --> 01:19:19,149
Well, no, it's for other reasons, but it still is.

1684
01:19:19,149 --> 01:19:21,149
Well, let's get to work on the marketing campaign.

1685
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:25,149
If you want to start on the poster design, click on the drawing table.

1686
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:28,149
To print up tickets, use the ticomatic.

1687
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:32,149
Use the title vision machine to print credit titles to add to your film.

1688
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:34,520
Let's do poster.

1689
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,130
Okay.

1690
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:41,130
That blank spot in the middle of your desk is your canvas.

1691
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:44,130
In order to place a graphic image onto your canvas,

1692
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,130
click on the stacks of pictures on the left.

1693
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:51,130
When you click on a stack, you'll see all of that stack's images displayed.

1694
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:54,130
Click on whatever image you want, then drag it to the canvas.

1695
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,130
Place as many as you want to work with.

1696
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:01,130
Once they're on the canvas, you can select your images and move them to the foreground or the background.

1697
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,130
Resize them or erase them.

1698
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:06,130
If you make a mistake, use the undo button.

1699
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:10,130
If you don't like the image, click on the eraser and the selected image will disappear.

1700
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:13,130
If you want to add words, click on the stencils.

1701
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:16,130
When you're done, you can print your poster with the print button.

1702
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:21,130
If you have any trouble, use the help screen on my PA page for further detail.

1703
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:41,899
No.

1704
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:44,899
No, undo, undo, undo.

1705
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:54,060
Use the pen.

1706
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:58,859
How do I use the pen?

1707
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:25,310
I want this in the, here we go.

1708
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:28,310
Switch to the back, I want this in the foreground.

1709
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:29,310
Okay.

1710
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:56,369
Now I want, now it's going to be big like that.

1711
01:21:56,369 --> 01:22:07,739
Alright, how do I use this paint?

1712
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:38,239
It looks like shit.

1713
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:47,359
That's the kind of cover that somebody makes when they make their own DVDs.

1714
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:53,989
I've probably made college DVDs where I had to DVD label maker.

1715
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:55,989
And I thought it was, I was so cool.

1716
01:22:55,989 --> 01:23:50,760
It wasn't too big.

1717
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,430
No, this one's better.

1718
01:23:54,430 --> 01:24:07,229
Up a little more, like right, right there.

1719
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:13,210
Alright, this is, I don't, I don't like the pink.

1720
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:16,470
Yeah, it's going to have to do.

1721
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,779
Anything else?

1722
01:24:17,779 --> 01:24:49,670
Oh, fuck.

1723
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:52,680
Oh shit.

1724
01:24:52,680 --> 01:25:44,989
I'm done.

1725
01:25:44,989 --> 01:25:48,449
Next, next picture please.

1726
01:25:48,449 --> 01:26:00,180
Needs more kissing.

1727
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,180
This is, that's better.

1728
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:03,739
So that's it, right?

1729
01:26:03,739 --> 01:26:04,979
I'm done.

1730
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:07,359
Print it.

1731
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:08,859
Post it done.

1732
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:11,949
Is it right here?

1733
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:12,949
Windows 10 print.

1734
01:26:12,949 --> 01:26:14,949
No, no, I don't want to print this.

1735
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:17,319
I don't want to print this.

1736
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:19,880
I don't have a printer hooked up.

1737
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:28,779
In the dryer poster heralds a hot new film.

1738
01:26:28,779 --> 01:26:30,779
Tickets gone with the wind.

1739
01:26:30,779 --> 01:26:33,680
Okay.

1740
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,859

1741
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:39,949
You may press the left arrow at any time to change a previous entry.

1742
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:41,949
Press okay to move forward.

1743
01:26:41,949 --> 01:26:43,949
This is where you'll make your titles.

1744
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,949
Just answer the questions that the title machine asks

1745
01:26:46,949 --> 01:26:49,949
and you'll get to make the credits for your film.

1746
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:53,180
Okay.

1747
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:57,020
Do you want to change the title?

1748
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,020
No.

1749
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:05,670
Click on the window to cycle through the title effects.

1750
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:17,920
No, that's not, that's fine.

1751
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,060
George Lucas wipe?

1752
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,510
That's good.

1753
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,970
Click on the window to step through the fonts.

1754
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:28,659
Good.

1755
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:33,500
Click on the window to split the foreground colors.

1756
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:37,869
Red.

1757
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:41,859
Ugh.

1758
01:27:41,859 --> 01:27:43,859
Ugh.

1759
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:45,359
What do you think?

1760
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:47,359
Should I do 3D glasses?

1761
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:56,779
Yeah, I think we should do look at anything else with 3D glasses on.

1762
01:27:56,779 --> 01:27:57,779
That sounds good.

1763
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:07,600
Ugh.

1764
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,500
That's fine.

1765
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,500
No.

1766
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,500
No, just black.

1767
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,260
That's good.

1768
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,260
Do you want your credits to play before the movie?

1769
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,260
After the movie.

1770
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:24,899
Would you like to credit your writers?

1771
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:27,460
Would you like to credit your DP?

1772
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:33,489
Would you like to credit your production assistant?

1773
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:35,489
Would you like to credit the rest of your crew?

1774
01:28:35,489 --> 01:28:36,489
It was me.

1775
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:39,010
Stunt coordinator.

1776
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:41,010
What stunts?

1777
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:46,489
Press okay if you'd like this disclaimer to appear in your credits.

1778
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:50,029
Disclaimer.

1779
01:28:50,029 --> 01:29:02,189
Select a musical style for your credits.

1780
01:29:02,189 --> 01:29:20,289
Okay, or...

1781
01:29:20,289 --> 01:29:21,289
That's better.

1782
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:26,579
It's a lightning strike too.

1783
01:29:26,579 --> 01:29:31,789
Alright.

1784
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:32,789
Steven Spielberg presents.

1785
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:48,060
Are you just going to slap your name on this?

1786
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:51,350
Okay.

1787
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,350
Now the tick-o-matic.

1788
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:55,039
Whatever this is.

1789
01:29:55,039 --> 01:30:00,180
Oh, it's the ticket.

1790
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:04,180
This is where you'll make tickets for your film's premiere.

1791
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:06,180
Just answer the questions as they come up.

1792
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:09,180
And when you're done, you can print out the tickets eight at a time.

1793
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:13,899
Only eight.

1794
01:30:13,899 --> 01:30:15,899
Do you want your name to appear on the ticket?

1795
01:30:15,899 --> 01:30:17,779
Yes.

1796
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,779
What is the price that you'd like to appear on the ticket?

1797
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:40,010
Twenty million dollars?

1798
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:43,359
Nobody can go.

1799
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:44,359
No.

1800
01:30:44,359 --> 01:30:45,359
It would...

1801
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:46,359
Uh...

1802
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:47,359
Let's make it...

1803
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:48,359
Let's make it like a...

1804
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:50,359
Fifty-five hundred bucks.

1805
01:30:50,359 --> 01:30:52,050
Fifty-five hundred dollars.

1806
01:30:52,050 --> 01:30:59,829
Click on the ticket to step through the ticket styles.

1807
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:04,659
That one's good.

1808
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:07,539
Click on the ticket to step through the ta...

1809
01:31:07,539 --> 01:31:08,539
The fonts.

1810
01:31:08,539 --> 01:31:18,420
Alright.

1811
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:25,590
Are these movie tickets or are these like boyfriend girlfriend good-for-one back rub coupons?

1812
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:39,739
Click on...

1813
01:31:39,739 --> 01:31:42,840
That's good.

1814
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,840
Make that huge.

1815
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:54,140
This doesn't even matter.

1816
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,770
Press the print button to print it.

1817
01:31:56,770 --> 01:31:58,770
Eight tickets fit on a letter size page.

1818
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,460
No.

1819
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:10,260
They really did want you to print this and give it to your parents and then they watch

1820
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:12,630
what you did in here.

1821
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:17,729
That's why they have a monetary number here.

1822
01:32:17,729 --> 01:32:18,729
I get it.

1823
01:32:18,729 --> 01:32:20,729
It's to get the family in the room.

1824
01:32:20,729 --> 01:32:25,909
What do you mean print it?

1825
01:32:25,909 --> 01:32:30,369
Why do I have to print this and put it in the Discord?

1826
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:35,699
You know you can just press the screen cap button and just crop that and just use it

1827
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:40,069
for whatever you want.

1828
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:41,069
Print it.

1829
01:32:41,069 --> 01:32:42,069
I don't have a printer!

1830
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:43,699
We're good.

1831
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:48,130
Jeremy French Fry writes own ticket on In the Dryer.

1832
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:51,800
What?

1833
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,050
We're good.

1834
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,979
Let's go.

1835
01:32:59,979 --> 01:33:03,409
What about the lab?

1836
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:16,460
What's the lab?

1837
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:21,460
So the suspense begins here because this is the lab where your film will be processed and

1838
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,460
it can take a while so we'll keep you posted.

1839
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,460
What?

1840
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:27,659
What do you mean it can take a while?

1841
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:35,619
Start the...

1842
01:33:35,619 --> 01:33:39,619
I'm your music editor and I can't help but notice you don't have any music in your movie.

1843
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:49,630
If your budget can afford it, come back with me to the music studio and let's get to work.

1844
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:51,630
Alright, let's put some music in.

1845
01:33:51,630 --> 01:34:01,079
I'm going to put in like five seconds of music.

1846
01:34:01,079 --> 01:34:04,079
The movie is only like 42 seconds long.

1847
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:08,789
You ever watch a movie on TV with the sound off?

1848
01:34:08,789 --> 01:34:11,970
Something's missing and it's not just the dialogue.

1849
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:16,970
The music that plays under each scene is such a critical part of movie making because it

1850
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:21,970
might set a delicate mood, it might make us cry, or keep us in gut-twisting suspense,

1851
01:34:21,970 --> 01:34:24,970
or tell us when to be scared and for how long.

1852
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:32,340
Hi, I'm Laurie Higgins Tobias, your music editor.

1853
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:37,340
I'll be doing the same work on your film as I did on the Flintstones, Stargate, and Independence

1854
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:38,340
Day.

1855
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,340
A lot of Flintstones movie makers here.

1856
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,340
A music editor helps create a useful concept and foundation for the movie.

1857
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:48,340
While working on the Flintstones, playing music from the original cartoon series underneath

1858
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:53,340
early edits of the movie, helps the director decide which style of music to use in the

1859
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,340
finished film.

1860
01:34:55,340 --> 01:35:00,340
I've watched your cut, selected some music cues, and broken them down by categories.

1861
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,340
The Flintstones live action?

1862
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:05,340
You will have to decide what kind of mood to set by matching the music cues with the

1863
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:08,340
scenes you have already cut together.

1864
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:13,340
The music is broken down by category in the book down there on the mixing board.

1865
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,340
Your PA will tell you how to lay down your music track.

1866
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:20,340
I know, you're going to have to hit record, then play, then play a song.

1867
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:25,340
In the beginning levels, you'll only have access to a few instruments, but with experience,

1868
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:29,340
you'll be able to add the sound of a rock band or even a symphony orchestra.

1869
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:34,340
To lay down your music, open a music button and select the kind of music you want to work

1870
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,340
with.

1871
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:38,340
From there, select a music cue and the instruments will set up to play.

1872
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,340
To record, hit the record button followed by the play button.

1873
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:45,340
To play the music, just click on the instruments.

1874
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:49,210
Okay, so let's see.

1875
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,210
Small orchestra, strings.

1876
01:35:51,210 --> 01:36:13,529
I don't understand.

1877
01:36:13,529 --> 01:36:26,260
Why are there pictures in here?

1878
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:28,260
Literally click the instruments.

1879
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:34,109
What instrument?

1880
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:36,630
Oh.

1881
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:39,829
Why would you have the light off back here?

1882
01:36:39,829 --> 01:36:50,289
What?

1883
01:36:50,289 --> 01:36:54,699
What the fuck is going on?

1884
01:36:54,699 --> 01:37:13,239
Oh, this just turns the lights on and turns the lights off.

1885
01:37:13,239 --> 01:37:23,000
I didn't do that.

1886
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
What the fuck is happening in this movie?

1887
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I didn't put this music in.

1888
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:38,260
What the fuck was that?

1889
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:40,890
It's cursed.

1890
01:37:40,890 --> 01:38:01,390
Oh shit, does that mean it's loud?

1891
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:05,590
Alright, well, I don't know.

1892
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:16,970
Figured it out.

1893
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:20,970
Alright, so it's open book, pick thing, click up here.

1894
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:24,550
That is very dumb.

1895
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:26,819
Alright.

1896
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:35,979
What?

1897
01:38:35,979 --> 01:38:48,779
I don't have enough money to do this.

1898
01:38:48,779 --> 01:38:49,779
I don't have enough money.

1899
01:38:49,779 --> 01:38:50,779
I gotta get out.

1900
01:38:50,779 --> 01:39:18,699
I gotta get out.

1901
01:39:18,699 --> 01:39:30,380
Okay, here we go.

1902
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,260
You ready?

1903
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,069
This is it.

1904
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:37,579
Three, two, one.

1905
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:42,590
Action.

1906
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:44,220
Hey!

1907
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:47,699
No!

1908
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:49,319
Why is it not doing it?

1909
01:39:49,319 --> 01:39:50,319
That just costed money.

1910
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:51,319
It didn't do anything.

1911
01:39:51,319 --> 01:40:01,500
Oh, you motherfucker, really?

1912
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:23,979
What the fuck?

1913
01:40:23,979 --> 01:40:30,449
Oh god, the game's breaking.

1914
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:44,510
Alright, alright, alright.

1915
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:48,310
Why?

1916
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,310
Why?

1917
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:51,310
What the fuck?

1918
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:52,310
Why?

1919
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:58,649
I can't record it.

1920
01:40:58,649 --> 01:41:01,420
I don't have any money.

1921
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,420
Alright, well, fuck it.

1922
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:10,579
That's it.

1923
01:41:10,579 --> 01:41:12,390
Print it.

1924
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:13,390
That's it.

1925
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:24,810
Let's go.

1926
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:25,810
I'm out of money.

1927
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:37,159
Process.

1928
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:44,479
Is it working?

1929
01:41:44,479 --> 01:42:20,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1930
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,600
Maybe it'll remember us.

1931
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,600
Maybe it'll remember us.

1932
01:42:28,869 --> 01:42:29,869
There's no save game.

1933
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:32,869
Maybe it might just remember who we are.

1934
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:41,979
You know what I mean?

1935
01:42:41,979 --> 01:42:44,979
It could just remember that we were doing this.

1936
01:42:44,979 --> 01:42:47,119
It's a Windows game.

1937
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,119
Definitely not.

1938
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:49,119
You never know.

1939
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:52,119
Because when I'm during all that, like cutting and shit,

1940
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:54,119
I think it's just dumping shit into the C drive.

1941
01:42:54,119 --> 01:43:07,069
No!

1942
01:43:07,069 --> 01:43:10,699
No, it was going so well!

1943
01:43:10,699 --> 01:43:13,130
It was going so well!

1944
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:15,130
At least we got to see it.

1945
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:16,130
Damn it!

1946
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:37,979
There was so much more to explore.

1947
01:43:37,979 --> 01:43:38,979
I can skip that.

1948
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:39,979
Welcome.

1949
01:43:39,979 --> 01:43:43,289
I've chosen you.

1950
01:43:43,289 --> 01:43:44,289
Okay.

1951
01:43:44,289 --> 01:43:49,939
Whoa.

1952
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:54,140
Yeah, I don't think there even is.

1953
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:56,699
I'm gonna laugh my ass off, please.

1954
01:43:56,699 --> 01:44:04,619
I would laugh my ass off if the poster's still here.

1955
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:05,619
No.

1956
01:44:05,619 --> 01:44:12,529
We were so close to clicking on this.

1957
01:44:12,529 --> 01:44:14,529
We were so close.

1958
01:44:14,529 --> 01:44:22,979
I'm not giving up yet.

1959
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:38,489
It's not here.

1960
01:44:38,489 --> 01:44:40,489
It's not here.

1961
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:45,619
Okay, now this is Studio Operations, where you get started.

1962
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:46,619
Oh!

1963
01:44:46,619 --> 01:44:47,619
Oh!

1964
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:48,619
Oh!

1965
01:44:48,619 --> 01:44:49,619
Oh!

1966
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:52,020
Oh!

1967
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:53,020
It's here!

1968
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:54,510
Wait.

1969
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:55,510
But what?

1970
01:44:55,510 --> 01:45:01,079
I don't want to write over this.

1971
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:02,079
Hold on.

1972
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:04,079
Am I gonna write over this?

1973
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:11,930
Like, just, that's the movie, right?

1974
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,359
Just hit okay.

1975
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:15,359
Just, that's the movie, right?

1976
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:22,020
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1977
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:31,100
Just go to the theater.

1978
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:32,100
Look up what it does.

1979
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,100
Guys, nobody's ever played this game before.

1980
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:39,350
I'm gonna go to the theater.

1981
01:45:39,350 --> 01:45:55,310
Disc three.

1982
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:56,310
I got it.

1983
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:57,310
Where's disc two?

1984
01:45:57,310 --> 01:45:58,310
I freaked out and dropped it.

1985
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:59,310
It's right here.

1986
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:17,039
I got a piss tube really bad.

1987
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:23,340
All right, come on.

1988
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:24,340
Let us, let us watch it.

1989
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:27,340
Let us get the, we've been here for like almost two hours.

1990
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:36,449
Mit one.

1991
01:46:36,449 --> 01:46:43,579
What?

1992
01:46:43,579 --> 01:46:49,250
This isn't my movie.

1993
01:46:49,250 --> 01:47:01,939
Okay.

1994
01:47:01,939 --> 01:47:06,529
All these, where's your movie?

1995
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:11,239
Is this the credits of the game?

1996
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:20,079
Imagine you went to watch a movie and it was just the credits of the movie.

1997
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:26,930
Well, that sucked.

1998
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:29,359
What a shitty movie.

1999
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:30,359
Oh my God.

2000
01:47:30,359 --> 01:47:31,359
All right.

2001
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:33,359
I have to, we have to try to load the other one.

2002
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:34,979
You know what I'm saying?

2003
01:47:34,979 --> 01:47:39,210
Go back to the save.

2004
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:40,449
Hold on.

2005
01:47:40,449 --> 01:47:41,449
I can't make decisions like this.

2006
01:47:41,449 --> 01:47:42,449
I'm gonna pee my pants.

2007
01:47:42,449 --> 01:47:45,449
I can't make a decision with a piss building up inside me.

2008
01:47:45,449 --> 01:47:56,350
All right.

2009
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:57,350
Give me, I'll be right back.

2010
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,350
I'm literally going to die.

2011
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:00,350
I'm going to piss my pants if I don't leave right now.

2012
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:21,840
I'll be right back.

2013
01:48:21,840 --> 01:50:13,930
All right.

2014
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:15,229
We're going to try to load that save.

2015
01:50:15,229 --> 01:50:30,029
American dad music.

2016
01:50:30,029 --> 01:50:34,340
Back up, back up the files, back up the files.

2017
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:37,789
I think, I think this is this.

2018
01:50:37,789 --> 01:50:40,350
I'm here to assist you.

2019
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:41,350
What happened to it?

2020
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:45,600
Oh my God.

2021
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:54,920
You're going to give me a fucking heart attack.

2022
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,920
There's okay and there's delete.

2023
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,920
So snapshot VM.

2024
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,920
I don't know how to do that.

2025
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:14,130
I have absolutely no fucking idea how to do that.

2026
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:16,130
Test it on an empty slot.

2027
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:22,739
Got it.

2028
01:51:22,739 --> 01:51:24,750
Bingo.

2029
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:38,020
Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo.

2030
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:40,729
There it is.

2031
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:42,539
Options.

2032
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:43,539
Export, import.

2033
01:51:43,539 --> 01:52:01,979
No, this is fine.

2034
01:52:01,979 --> 01:52:06,539
We're good.

2035
01:52:06,539 --> 01:52:08,539
I'm just, we're just going to watch it.

2036
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:11,359
We don't need to go to the fucking lab.

2037
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:14,739
Let's go.

2038
01:52:14,739 --> 01:52:15,739
In the dryer.

2039
01:52:15,739 --> 01:52:20,239
Yeah.

2040
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:21,239
Oh shit.

2041
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:30,220
Fuck the lab.

2042
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:36,840
Oh.

2043
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:37,840
That's bullshit.

2044
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,409
Fucking disk two.

2045
01:52:43,409 --> 01:52:55,140
Disk swap.

2046
01:52:55,140 --> 01:53:04,770
All right.

2047
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:05,770
I ain't going to move.

2048
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:06,770
I'm not touching anything.

2049
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:11,500
I'm going to let it just sit here for a second.

2050
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
I'm not touching anything.

2051
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:19,539
Nobody move.

2052
01:53:19,539 --> 01:53:26,649
I have start and I have stop.

2053
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:28,079
Okay.

2054
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:30,340
Here we go.

2055
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,739
Start.

2056
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:38,260
Okay.

2057
01:53:38,260 --> 01:54:09,630
Don't move.

2058
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:15,029
Now what?

2059
01:54:15,029 --> 01:54:16,029
I don't think we can print them.

2060
01:54:16,029 --> 01:54:19,510
I think they're unprintable.

2061
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:36,659
We're just going to have to view the work print.

2062
01:54:36,659 --> 01:54:37,970
That's all we can do.

2063
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:39,970
We know we're going to have no sound effects.

2064
01:54:39,970 --> 01:54:46,779
Damn it.

2065
01:54:46,779 --> 01:54:50,939
Oh, well, whatever.

2066
01:54:50,939 --> 01:54:51,939
We can still do it.

2067
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:55,949
It's still all right.

2068
01:54:55,949 --> 01:55:08,010
Export it.

2069
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:09,010
Actually sad.

2070
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:10,010
Well, that's unfortunate.

2071
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:15,130
But you know, these are all a complete gamble.

2072
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:19,130
Every single one of these games that you're going to see that you have seen is just throw

2073
01:55:19,130 --> 01:55:20,130
dice in the air.

2074
01:55:20,130 --> 01:55:21,130
Is it going to work?

2075
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:29,020
Who fucking knows?

2076
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:33,100
I'm just really happy that we at least got to see this shit.

2077
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:44,369
I'm going to try to export it.

2078
01:55:44,369 --> 01:55:48,939
Welcome.

2079
01:55:48,939 --> 01:55:49,939
Whoa.

2080
01:55:49,939 --> 01:55:50,939
Whoa.

2081
01:55:50,939 --> 01:55:54,539
Here we go.

2082
01:55:54,539 --> 01:55:55,539
I'm here to assist you.

2083
01:55:55,539 --> 01:55:57,909
Don't scare me like this.

2084
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:01,199
Okay.

2085
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:04,199
So German French fry loaded up.

2086
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:05,199
Okay.

2087
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:11,859
I'm going to go to options and I'm going to go to export.

2088
01:56:11,859 --> 01:56:14,699
Export to where?

2089
01:56:14,699 --> 01:56:15,699
Hold on.

2090
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:19,300
Let me just.

2091
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,569
Oh, this is not.

2092
01:56:21,569 --> 01:56:29,430
This is not doing what I think you guys think it's going to do.

2093
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:30,670
I did it.

2094
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:31,670
It's a dot.

2095
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:32,670
Dat.

2096
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:33,670
Here.

2097
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,670
Why is this not on?

2098
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,869
Look.

2099
01:56:36,869 --> 01:56:39,970
Okay.

2100
01:56:39,970 --> 01:56:40,970
It.

2101
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:41,970
That's what I just did.

2102
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:46,979
Export dot.

2103
01:56:46,979 --> 01:56:47,979
Dat.

2104
01:56:47,979 --> 01:56:49,350
You know, let's go.

2105
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:52,859
Let's just watch the movie while we have a minute.

2106
01:56:52,859 --> 01:56:53,859
We just need to see it.

2107
01:56:53,859 --> 01:57:00,600
It's a save file.

2108
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:01,600
Not the movie.

2109
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:02,600
That's unfortunate.

2110
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:07,819
Will VLC play this?

2111
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:15,710
Oh, well, let's go into the dryer.

2112
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:20,420
Let's view the work print.

2113
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:28,680
Got to do what we got to do.

2114
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:29,680
Load the dot.

2115
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:30,680
Dat and windows media to view it.

2116
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:35,680
I highly, highly suspect that that's going to work.

2117
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:43,960
At least give us this.

2118
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:44,960
Give us this.

2119
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,960
Let us at least see the damn thing.

2120
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,100
Even without music, it don't matter.

2121
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:58,760
Here we go.

2122
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,260
There's nobody in.

2123
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,260
Oh, right.

2124
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:02,260
Because it's $5,000 a ticket.

2125
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,260
That makes sense.

2126
01:58:03,260 --> 01:58:05,010
Nobody here.

2127
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:06,569
Mom.

2128
01:58:06,569 --> 01:58:33,470
I guess this is goodbye.

2129
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:59,689
Any last words?

2130
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:32,279
Impresses the studio with sharp director's cut.

2131
01:59:32,279 --> 01:59:33,279
Ooh.

2132
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:34,279
Did it.

2133
01:59:34,279 --> 01:59:45,119
Try the lab now.

2134
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:48,979
All right.

2135
01:59:48,979 --> 01:59:49,979
I'm going to try the lab.

2136
01:59:49,979 --> 01:59:51,930
I'm going to try the lab quick.

2137
01:59:51,930 --> 01:59:52,930
I'm going to do lab.

2138
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:53,930
Press button.

2139
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:55,100
Start walking around.

2140
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:56,100
I'm not even going to give it a second.

2141
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:57,100
Ready?

2142
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,100
Watch this.

2143
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,100
Here we go.

2144
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:00,100
One, two, three.

2145
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,100
Start it.

2146
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:02,100
It's going.

2147
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:03,100
Here's the thing.

2148
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:04,100
I'm fucking leaving now.

2149
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:05,409
Leave.

2150
02:00:05,409 --> 02:00:06,409
Leave.

2151
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:07,899
Quick.

2152
02:00:07,899 --> 02:00:08,899
Out.

2153
02:00:08,899 --> 02:00:09,899
Out.

2154
02:00:09,899 --> 02:00:10,899
Leave.

2155
02:00:10,899 --> 02:00:11,899
Leave.

2156
02:00:11,899 --> 02:00:15,899
Leave.

2157
02:00:15,899 --> 02:00:18,420
I can't.

2158
02:00:18,420 --> 02:00:20,039
It's frozen.

2159
02:00:20,039 --> 02:00:22,750
Stop it.

2160
02:00:22,750 --> 02:00:23,750
Oh.

2161
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,750
I caught it right in the middle.

2162
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:25,750
What should I do?

2163
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:26,750
Should I say yes?

2164
02:00:26,750 --> 02:00:27,750
I fucked it up.

2165
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:33,340
So now should I say yes?

2166
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:36,560
Because right now it's like, hold on, wait a minute.

2167
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:37,560
I caught it.

2168
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:41,869
Keep going.

2169
02:00:41,869 --> 02:00:49,000
Stop it again.

2170
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Like, you don't.

2171
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
No, don't.

2172
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Like, I'm just trying to keep it from crashing.

2173
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,859
You know what I mean?

2174
02:00:55,859 --> 02:00:56,859
Like, every, like, five, fuck you.

2175
02:00:56,859 --> 02:00:57,859
No, it's not going to work.

2176
02:00:57,859 --> 02:01:04,300
I thought I could, like, intervene and, like, make it think again.

2177
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,300
No.

2178
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,739
It's not going to work.

2179
02:01:07,739 --> 02:01:08,739
Oh, well.

2180
02:01:08,739 --> 02:01:10,619
The dat is a media file.

2181
02:01:10,619 --> 02:01:21,069
Open it in...

2182
02:01:21,069 --> 02:01:22,069
Hold on.

2183
02:01:22,069 --> 02:01:23,069
Wait a second.

2184
02:01:23,069 --> 02:01:26,680
You telling me that's a media file?

2185
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:30,670
Let me look.

2186
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:33,850
I'm going to laugh my fucking ass off if that's true.

2187
02:01:33,850 --> 02:01:36,239
All right.

2188
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:40,250
Let's go into director's chair.

2189
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:46,369
Here's movie, movie dot dat.

2190
02:01:46,369 --> 02:01:47,369
Okay.

2191
02:01:47,369 --> 02:01:48,609
There it is.

2192
02:01:48,609 --> 02:01:49,609
It's 63 kilobytes, guys.

2193
02:01:49,609 --> 02:01:50,609
I don't think this is going to work.

2194
02:01:50,609 --> 02:01:51,609
Okay.

2195
02:01:51,609 --> 02:02:08,539
I'm going to open this with VLC media player.

2196
02:02:08,539 --> 02:02:09,539
No, that ain't going to work.

2197
02:02:09,539 --> 02:02:24,779
It's not going to work.

2198
02:02:24,779 --> 02:02:25,779
Oh, well.

2199
02:02:25,779 --> 02:02:27,340
Oh, well.

2200
02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:28,340
Let's keep going.

2201
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:45,560
This next one we're going to put in is going to be a very interesting.

2202
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,560
At least we got to see it.

2203
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,560
At least we got to play it.

2204
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:53,619
And I kind of want to do more of that.

2205
02:02:53,619 --> 02:02:57,750
Put the dat file in your router config.

2206
02:02:57,750 --> 02:03:01,869
Why would I fucking do that?

2207
02:03:01,869 --> 02:03:02,869
All right.

2208
02:03:02,869 --> 02:03:08,369
The next one is called Piper, where you play as the Pied Piper.

2209
02:03:09,369 --> 02:03:11,380
It is a children's game.

2210
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:12,380
Give me one sec.

2211
02:03:12,380 --> 02:03:13,380
Will I move this around?

2212
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,380
Piper.

2213
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:19,010
I might have to move the viewing angle around a little bit.

2214
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:20,010
Let me get into here.

2215

Every day there are children all over the world who can't afford decent shoes

Let me explain it logically

2563
02:55:42,479 --> 02:55:45,840
It's these feminazi's who are taking over the country

2564
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:51,840
Bill re and all of her friends are out there meddling in the government when they should be holding Tupperware parties and such

Hey, we didn't vote for it. It's all the same you see

2566
02:55:56,040 --> 02:56:02,360
these feminazi's think that they could whip us all into shape and and tie us up and have their way with us and

2567
02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:05,399
make us kiss their feet and put us in handcuffs and

2568
02:56:06,399 --> 02:56:08,399
I can't stand it anymore

2569
02:56:19,719 --> 02:56:26,440

02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:30,799
Princess Griselda, she's going to get the last laugh on the prince

2571
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:35,280
She's independent wild and finally free of the old bore

2572
02:56:35,920 --> 02:56:39,360
Just because it is ready to a royal family does not mean

2573
02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:42,120
I love my mother-in-law

2574
02:56:45,719 --> 02:56:50,760

2575
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:55,139

Ten we take you now to a live press conference Liz Naylor and Flash Rockman get together to announce their new Cologne soul to soul

It's a brand new kind of cologne the first of its kind for both sexes it's pure attraction

02:59:52,899 --> 02:59:54,899
We're calling it so

2590
02:59:54,979 --> 02:59:56,459
Too slow

2591
02:59:56,459 --> 03:00:00,139
There's a real drop of fish oil in every bottle. Oh

2592
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:04,340

Share like said and I quote people used to line up for miles to see him

Get that dick don't do that. What are you doing as you can see here?

2601
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:50,100
Bob is lubricating the master screw

2602
03:00:57,020 --> 03:00:58,819
As you can see here

2603
03:00:58,819 --> 03:01:04,639
We're talking today with women who only have one love in their life

2604
03:01:04,920 --> 03:01:12,440

Should I go back to the camera place? See if I can get the alien again?

2873
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:29,489
I wonder if that'll happen again

2874
03:32:29,489 --> 03:32:32,620
You got to get it right when he's coming out the door and then run

2875
03:32:33,260 --> 03:32:37,819
I haven't even been to the mall

2876
03:32:37,819 --> 03:32:43,500
Let's try it

2877
03:32:43,500 --> 03:33:01,059
This is it

2878
03:33:01,059 --> 03:33:04,059
Okay. Here we go. Here we go. I'll get you ready

2879
03:33:05,700 --> 03:33:07,700
Right when he walks out take a photo run

2880
03:33:07,780 --> 03:33:12,510
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

2881
03:33:13,549 --> 03:33:17,979

2882
03:33:17,979 --> 03:33:18,940
Got it

2883
03:33:18,940 --> 03:33:27,170
It's like a kind of toilet paper around his face

2884
03:33:28,860 --> 03:33:31,100
Sell it to the fbi for five thousand dollars

2885
03:33:32,899 --> 03:33:38,930
Yep, you have photographed classified information

2886
03:33:39,649 --> 03:33:41,649
The fine for that is five thousand dollars

2887
03:33:42,129 --> 03:34:06,030
All right, I need disc two where's disc two I have it right here somewhere

2888
03:34:07,149 --> 03:34:12,530
Disc two, where's disc two?

2889
03:34:15,309 --> 03:34:17,309
Come on. Where the fuck is it?

2890
03:34:21,059 --> 03:34:24,450
I just dropped them all I just dropped them all

2891
03:34:28,639 --> 03:34:30,639
Shit my fucking pants

2892
03:34:39,700 --> 03:34:43,659
All right, put the button when it's in

2893
03:34:44,059 --> 03:34:45,180
Let's go

2894
03:34:45,180 --> 03:34:56,059
This game is fun though. It's just weird

2895
03:35:05,940 --> 03:35:07,860
Why are we on disc two now?

2896
03:35:07,860 --> 03:35:19,469
Come on. Come on. You can do it

2897
03:35:21,149 --> 03:35:23,069
I know you can do it

2898
03:35:23,069 --> 03:35:26,899
Pull through come on

2899
03:35:26,899 --> 03:35:28,899
Go go go go go go go

2900
03:35:30,989 --> 03:35:37,360
Yeah

2901
03:35:37,360 --> 03:35:42,000
Think think thinking thinking. I don't know. I'm not sure I have no idea

2902
03:35:45,659 --> 03:35:47,659
I can hear the disc being spun

2903
03:35:49,760 --> 03:35:56,159
Come on

2904
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:57,459
Get it

2905
03:35:57,459 --> 03:35:59,459
It's pulling it. I can hear it

2906
03:36:10,559 --> 03:36:13,059
Good to go. And what happened to you?

2907
03:36:14,540 --> 03:36:19,180
You know, I used to tell myself sure you're a paparazzi, but you're basically a nice person

2908
03:36:20,940 --> 03:36:23,760
And as it turns out

2909
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:27,920
You're just another lowlife like all the rest of them. Did I have to put this into lose?

2910
03:36:34,510 --> 03:36:35,649
darlings

2911
03:36:35,649 --> 03:36:37,889
I don't know about you, but

2912
03:36:38,610 --> 03:36:41,010
I just love my little foo foo

2913
03:36:47,299 --> 03:36:51,500
I don't want to see it. We've seen it already like redone

2914
03:36:52,379 --> 03:36:56,540
Today in sports the national union of ball inflators and makers went on strike

2915
03:36:57,260 --> 03:37:00,700
So now the sports industry truly has no balls

2916
03:37:01,659 --> 03:37:04,700
And if there were any balls, they'd be deflated anyway

2917
03:37:05,920 --> 03:37:10,959
The union is demanding the firstborn son of all sports fans before play can resume

2918
03:37:12,319 --> 03:37:14,690
So that's your sports for today

2919
03:37:14,690 --> 03:37:17,569
See you next time. What the fuck are you talking about?

2920
03:37:21,379 --> 03:37:24,239
baby channel

2921
03:37:24,239 --> 03:37:25,440
Wanda

2922
03:37:25,440 --> 03:37:35,110
What's this game called? It's called paparazzi. My next guest is definitely tails from tinsel town and definitely controversial

2923
03:37:36,530 --> 03:37:38,530
She's the virgin mary

2924
03:37:39,170 --> 03:37:40,930
And like her or not

2925
03:37:40,930 --> 03:37:42,930
She's here to sell her new book

2926
03:37:43,250 --> 03:37:45,250
I can't say the title

2927
03:37:45,329 --> 03:37:46,770
I'll just call it

2928
03:37:46,770 --> 03:37:47,809
Fred

2929
03:37:47,809 --> 03:37:50,850
What's the matter? Wanda? You're afraid to say

2930
03:37:52,290 --> 03:37:55,969
No, I just think fred is safer safe

2931
03:37:57,489 --> 03:38:03,329
Life isn't safe, baby. You've got to run with the bitches if you want to be a big dog, honey

2932
03:38:04,610 --> 03:38:06,610
Let's just talk about the book

2933
03:38:07,809 --> 03:38:10,930
Well, the book is about sex, of course

2934
03:38:11,649 --> 03:38:14,129
Are you afraid of sex? Wanda?

2935
03:38:14,770 --> 03:38:16,770
You don't have to be

2936
03:38:16,930 --> 03:38:18,770

2937
03:38:18,770 --> 03:38:21,969
Oh, she's gonna stop showing photos. What does it remind you of?

2938
03:38:23,709 --> 03:38:29,229
Don't turn that over here. I know it's so hard to tell so close up, of course, but

2939
03:38:31,309 --> 03:38:34,860
It's me

2946
03:39:02,219 --> 03:39:03,899

I walked across the street on the way home. I'm just walking along the scenic path

3046
03:49:40,610 --> 03:49:45,889
And all of a sudden this little stupid dog runs up and bites me so I kicked it

3047
03:49:46,450 --> 03:49:51,569
Then all of a sudden some lady is hitting me with a purse and yelling in hungarian

3048
03:49:52,370 --> 03:49:54,690

This is news one

3152
04:01:23,629 --> 04:01:25,870
One big star has been brought down a notch today

3153
04:01:26,270 --> 04:01:33,870
Lhasa abso former star of the tv series green junction was arrested for assaulting a police officer with a piece of dog dung

3154
04:01:34,510 --> 04:01:38,590
The officer reported that he was simply trying to get abso to clean up after her dog

3155
04:01:38,750 --> 04:01:42,750
That's when she became that's pretty cool and threw the offending opal at the officer

3156
04:01:43,389 --> 04:01:49,950
Lhasa was sentenced to serve 200 hours of community service for the city cleaning up poop in tinseltown park

3157
04:01:50,270 --> 04:01:52,110
And that's a scoop to me

3158
04:01:52,190 --> 04:01:55,629
Thanks for watching news you're on the news don't miss

3159
04:01:56,430 --> 04:01:57,950

It actually knows rib-eye sports in today's sports

3161
04:02:07,600 --> 04:02:09,600
Absolutely, nothing happened

3162
04:02:09,920 --> 04:02:14,879
I've been in this business for 12 years now, and this is definitely the first time this has happened

3163
04:02:19,389 --> 04:02:21,229
That's all

3164
04:02:21,229 --> 04:02:23,229
There's no baseball games. No tennis

3165
04:02:24,450 --> 04:02:28,610
Not even a curling match. Nothing. Nobody is playing anything anywhere today

3166
04:02:29,569 --> 04:02:37,040
What else is there to say nothing

3167
04:02:42,739 --> 04:02:51,260
That's awesome

3168
04:02:51,260 --> 04:02:55,420
For great taste and true spirit. All right, so what we got with tuesday night

3169
04:02:56,059 --> 04:02:57,579
We're going to the fog

3170
04:02:57,579 --> 04:03:08,379
We're meeting up with this, uh, this new contact. I don't know who it is

3171
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:14,750
I'm so glad you came

3172
04:03:15,069 --> 04:03:18,750
I'm sorry. I haven't talked to you for four years, but otto was very jealous

3173
04:03:20,190 --> 04:03:26,260
He doesn't like it when I spend a lot of time with my friends so

3174
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:32,780
Unpredictable

3175
04:03:58,219 --> 04:04:00,219
Yeah, okay, so what about it

3176
04:04:06,500 --> 04:04:11,790
Hotel

3177
04:04:14,079 --> 04:04:16,079
Anybody want this

3179
04:04:23,739 --> 04:04:25,920
Grand hotel, let's go

04:04:26,559 --> 04:04:31,680
Should we try?

3181
04:04:31,680 --> 04:04:33,840
What am I doing though? What am I doing this for?

3182
04:04:35,760 --> 04:04:37,760
This was a side story

3183
04:04:58,059 --> 04:05:00,059
Okay, so now we have to go

3184
04:05:00,940 --> 04:05:02,940

3185
04:05:02,940 --> 04:05:04,940
Now I just want to give you a little tip

3186
04:05:05,260 --> 04:05:09,020
If you happen to sell one of your photos to one of the less reputable publications

3187
04:05:09,899 --> 04:05:11,899
Well, who knows what they're going to use it for

3188
04:05:12,459 --> 04:05:17,659
Because sometimes they even put up your photos with an out and out lie for the caption who cares

3189
04:05:19,840 --> 04:05:22,799
All right. It's time for the mall. We have to get a picture of

04:06:13,700 --> 04:06:21,659
Food shelter clothing don't need such luxuries anything else as fancy dresses more perfumes

3200

vanities

3208
04:07:31,459 --> 04:07:33,219
For some reputation

3209

Or should I just don't even sell it and just keep my integrity. I do have a lot of money already

3210
04:07:46,670 --> 04:07:48,139
entertainer

3211
04:07:48,379 --> 04:07:53,500
The tinsel town tattler sounds like I think it's the more expensive the prices

3212
04:07:54,219 --> 04:08:08,399
The less integrity

3213
04:08:08,399 --> 04:08:10,399
We don't know that. I mean i'm just taking a guess

3214
04:08:14,979 --> 04:08:16,579
the tattler

3215
04:08:16,579 --> 04:08:18,579
Wait, it says it. What does it say?

3216
04:08:20,569 --> 04:08:22,350
integrity sneaky

3217
04:08:22,350 --> 04:08:26,190
Oh, so the the

3218
04:08:26,190 --> 04:08:28,190
That's definitely right. I'm selling all the vanities

3219
04:08:28,989 --> 04:08:38,659
Osr beats sjr and ow in rtg's display house is sharp. What the fuck it's all

3220
04:08:38,819 --> 04:08:42,260
All still sneaky that's all right

3221
04:08:43,379 --> 04:08:45,680
All right, should I tell the hotel again?

3222
04:08:46,239 --> 04:08:49,680
She says you're staying there

3223
04:09:07,229 --> 04:09:08,430
Pay your rent

3224
04:09:08,430 --> 04:09:11,860
I don't know how to pay my rent

3225
04:09:11,860 --> 04:09:18,340
Yeah, I was just at the grand haberne where I was supposed to be covering rob estesheen's speech at a drunk driving seminar

3226
04:09:18,340 --> 04:09:22,100
I was just there. Well, the problem is he wasn't there and no one seems to know where he was

3227
04:09:23,729 --> 04:09:25,809
Well, I guess he was just parting it up somewhere

3228
04:09:26,530 --> 04:09:38,319
Let's see that one again

3229
04:09:38,319 --> 04:09:41,440
We've seen it all

3230
04:09:41,440 --> 04:09:43,680

rosies

3234
04:09:54,639 --> 04:10:02,879
The club rosies the blue fog

3235
04:10:23,020 --> 04:10:25,020
Why did I become an agent?

3236
04:10:25,260 --> 04:10:29,020
Well, I came to tinsel town like thousands of other young starlets

3237
04:10:29,579 --> 04:10:31,579
Barely making it on tuna and ramen

3238
04:10:31,899 --> 04:10:36,860
Getting hit on by sleazy directors and when I did find work it was with a crappy script

3239
04:10:37,579 --> 04:10:40,459
This business can dry you up like a bowl of pretzels

3240
04:10:41,180 --> 04:10:43,180
Then I said to myself self

3241
04:10:43,420 --> 04:10:45,420
You could be doing this to other people

3242
04:10:46,139 --> 04:10:48,139
I love my job

3243
04:10:49,040 --> 04:10:53,139
Anything else that's it

3244
04:10:57,120 --> 04:10:59,120
All right, well then let's try

3245
04:11:01,229 --> 04:11:03,229

So we're with a club

No, it's another day. We missed it

3251
04:11:44,770 --> 04:11:48,850
It's another one of these

3252
04:11:56,049 --> 04:11:58,049
This is news

04:12:02,450 --> 04:12:07,489
Talk show host and billionaire okra salad raffle had just become a little less wealthy today

3254
04:12:07,889 --> 04:12:11,889

The plaintiff was compensated for home remedy pills plus punitive damages of two oxen a new car and a bony big screen tv

3258
04:12:32,209 --> 04:12:34,370

04:27:09,889 --> 04:27:13,010
When you get a good one, I want you to stay on it. This is a good one

3374

And our investigation just uncovered an invoice. Yeah iranian jelly beans shipped to tinseltown

3380
04:28:01,420 --> 04:28:06,139
And I think there's some sort of deal going down tonight in one of those dark alleys and none of our photographers are in town

3381
04:28:07,180 --> 04:28:11,020
alley, right? No, I don't have any assignments for you yet, but don't worry

My integrity I have to keep it good, but I also have to make money

3396
04:29:29,899 --> 04:29:35,889
What should I do with this?

3397
04:29:35,889 --> 04:29:40,270
Just give it to the fbi

3398
04:29:40,270 --> 04:29:42,190
Or should I just do?

3399
04:29:42,190 --> 04:29:48,190

Head down the alley. I'll try the alley. Why not?

3440
04:33:27,099 --> 04:33:29,099

3441
04:33:29,099 --> 04:33:40,099

3442
04:33:40,099 --> 04:33:44,990

Oh, do forgive me i've taken this moment to reminisce. I hope I did not bore you

3451
04:34:42,159 --> 04:34:44,159

3458
04:35:18,939 --> 04:35:20,939
And I have personally

3459
04:35:21,099 --> 04:35:23,259
Tried to raise the awareness of this problem

How did you get out of all of the charges?

3465

3703
05:04:45,220 --> 05:04:48,729
What do I do what do I do

3704
05:05:04,970 --> 05:05:09,060
Get out of the fucking way

3705
05:05:13,180 --> 05:05:15,759
I think I got it. I think I did it perfectly

3706
05:05:22,139 --> 05:05:24,619
Wait, wait, wait, does he do anything else?

3707
05:05:27,159 --> 05:05:38,020
I gotta run

3708
05:05:47,080 --> 05:05:50,520
Which one is better, I mean he's like clearly just like dead here

3709
05:05:55,000 --> 05:05:59,860
Okay, I got it

3710
05:05:59,860 --> 05:06:02,819
Which one I know but I mean that one wasn't a great picture

3711
05:06:04,619 --> 05:06:07,220
All right, so I need to

3712
05:06:07,220 --> 05:06:16,979
news review

3713
05:06:16,979 --> 05:06:19,700

05:06:23,099 --> 05:06:25,099
Nice. Okay. Here we go

3715
05:06:25,580 --> 05:06:32,470
Hey, this is important. This is bullshit again. Listen. Hey, let me tell you you get a bad rep in this town

3716
05:06:32,549 --> 05:06:34,630
Things go very bad for you

3717
05:06:34,709 --> 05:06:39,349
I mean you have to bribe your way in the places people do not want to talk to you the police even harass you

3718
05:06:39,990 --> 05:06:42,630
Let me tell you it sucks big donkey dogs

3719
05:06:44,470 --> 05:06:45,669
Yeah

3720
05:06:45,669 --> 05:06:50,979
See the news got it recorded earlier

3721
05:06:51,619 --> 05:06:53,619
Now we've seen this early

3722
05:06:53,619 --> 05:07:00,020
Sucking chest wound played a media elite only gig at the rosy conch to show off some new material from

3723
05:07:00,419 --> 05:07:02,419
Sean pendleton ball

3724
05:07:02,819 --> 05:07:04,419
Oops

3725
05:07:04,419 --> 05:07:08,099
You're watching the grab for great taste and

3726
05:07:08,819 --> 05:07:11,939
All right, I got nothing. I don't want to handy warthog. We eventually have to get

3727
05:07:12,659 --> 05:07:16,500
From embers burned before the darkened skies turn

3728
05:07:18,549 --> 05:07:21,270
That definitely means something who knows what the hell it's supposed to mean

3729
05:07:21,990 --> 05:07:23,029
I'm gonna try

3730
05:07:23,029 --> 05:07:25,849
Say that again, andy

3731
05:07:26,009 --> 05:07:30,409
Streak the dust from embers burn streak the dust from embers burn

3732
05:07:31,529 --> 05:07:34,409
Streak the dust from embers burn before the sky turns

3733
05:07:37,659 --> 05:07:39,819
Streak the dust from ember thryer

3734
05:07:40,459 --> 05:07:42,299
from fire

3735
05:07:42,299 --> 05:07:46,900
at night

3736
05:07:47,220 --> 05:07:53,400
Something at night before it turns to night time

3737
05:07:55,000 --> 05:08:01,080
But streak what does the streak the embers?

3738
05:08:01,720 --> 05:08:29,349
Say it again, andy

3739
05:08:31,189 --> 05:08:36,389
Streak the dust from embers burned before the darkened skies turn

3740
05:08:38,840 --> 05:08:41,000
Streak the dust from embers burned

3741
05:08:45,959 --> 05:08:56,650
aroma

3742
05:08:56,650 --> 05:08:58,650
Fallen arches. No

3743
05:09:00,040 --> 05:09:14,729
Cub lingo market. I think it's just horseshit. I don't think it means anything. I'm gonna go to the park

3744
05:09:32,860 --> 05:09:34,869
This doesn't do anything

3745
05:09:34,869 --> 05:09:52,729
It's just the they're just on the horse there we go. It's mom

3746
05:09:54,380 --> 05:09:56,860
Remembered me this is news

3747
05:10:02,360 --> 05:10:08,360
Bullets stripe the facade of news review weekly this afternoon in apparent drive-by shooting

3748
05:10:09,080 --> 05:10:15,400
No one was injured, but a spokesman for news review weekly said it was nothing of consequence. Just go home

3749
05:10:15,479 --> 05:10:17,939
Home

3750
05:10:17,939 --> 05:10:20,040
What?

3751
05:10:20,040 --> 05:10:22,840
This is kurt loaded with an mvt news retort

3752
05:10:23,319 --> 05:10:29,000
Screaming fans were on hand to greet the return of sucking chest wound after their successful baltic tour

3753
05:10:29,639 --> 05:10:34,200
We took the time to talk with these musical trendsetters. We did this already. We already saw these

3754
05:10:35,159 --> 05:10:37,560
Okay, let me tell you about jackie ray guns

3755
05:10:39,880 --> 05:10:41,159
All right

3756
05:10:41,159 --> 05:10:42,439
We don't have any

3757
05:10:42,439 --> 05:10:44,759
Does mom give us any cryptic info? I don't think so

3758
05:10:45,479 --> 05:10:49,590
Where do I want to go?

3759
05:10:49,590 --> 05:10:52,240
Back to the blue fog see when you get somebody

3760
05:10:57,099 --> 05:11:03,819
We're watching all reruns

3761
05:11:05,000 --> 05:11:06,709
There we go

3762
05:11:06,709 --> 05:11:12,470
Hey, it looks like you got the royal treatment. You better be more careful on those blue bloods. They'll give you a black eye or something

3763
05:11:13,349 --> 05:11:15,349
At least I know when to duck

3764
05:11:26,169 --> 05:11:28,169
Can I save this one on my computer?

3765
05:11:33,750 --> 05:11:35,750
Okay, so that was that

3766
05:11:38,860 --> 05:11:40,860
Club lingo, let's try the club

3767
05:11:42,310 --> 05:11:53,599
Jim again blackmail yourself

3768
05:12:10,939 --> 05:12:14,860
Well, we've made the part two i've got plenty of money I got plenty of

3769
05:12:16,549 --> 05:12:17,590
um

3770
05:12:17,590 --> 05:12:19,110
integrity

3771
05:12:19,110 --> 05:12:20,889
We're good to go

3772
05:12:20,889 --> 05:12:22,810
Whatever happens happens here

3773
05:12:22,810 --> 05:12:35,000
Wait, was that paparazzi too? Or was that stephen spielberg's director's cd too?

3774
05:12:39,959 --> 05:12:41,959
Uh-oh. No, no, it's the right one. Okay

3775
05:12:45,029 --> 05:12:47,900
Wait, was it?

3776
05:12:47,900 --> 05:12:51,500
Yeah, it was good. Good. I was gonna say that's not good if that were the case

3777
05:12:52,220 --> 05:12:59,959
Looks good

3778
05:12:59,959 --> 05:13:03,740
So what is that?

3779
05:13:03,740 --> 05:13:07,779
Very cool

3780
05:13:07,779 --> 05:13:10,020
So this is the half. This has to be like the halfway point, right?

3781
05:13:10,659 --> 05:13:12,250
It's two discs

3782
05:13:12,250 --> 05:13:21,340
What's the status on a pog with the voting time?

3783
05:13:24,229 --> 05:13:40,119
I was at the party and everyone was asking about you me. I gotta tell you friend

3784
05:13:40,279 --> 05:13:44,520
You are making some really big and tasty way if you know what I mean

3785
05:13:45,529 --> 05:13:50,569
All right, so my reputation is high I just can't tell you that you are really my favorite right now

3786
05:13:50,650 --> 05:13:56,540
You're really making us rich. Keep it up, baby. Good. Everybody loves me darlings

3787
05:13:58,970 --> 05:14:01,659
There's the poop thrower

3788
05:14:08,310 --> 05:14:10,740
We've already seen all these

3789
05:14:10,740 --> 05:14:11,939
All right

3790
05:14:11,939 --> 05:14:15,380
How about we open it up at the market? Let's go

3791
05:14:16,580 --> 05:14:37,369
What do we got here stealing?

3792
05:14:53,509 --> 05:15:00,569
All right, I got I got it which one left one on the right

3793
05:15:10,659 --> 05:15:12,419
That's why you flee

3794
05:15:12,419 --> 05:15:15,880
Okay, if you wait too long, then they like

3795
05:15:16,819 --> 05:15:33,659
You break your camera. I stay I

3796
05:15:34,299 --> 05:15:36,299
I sat there for a long fucking time

3797
05:15:51,930 --> 05:15:53,930
Oh, is this the is the michael jackson thing again?

3798
05:15:55,189 --> 05:15:57,189
All right. Well now it's

3799
05:15:57,270 --> 05:15:59,270
Well, at least i'm gonna get this

3800
05:15:59,880 --> 05:16:12,810
this photo

3801
05:16:12,810 --> 05:16:15,430
There it is. That's what I needed

3802
05:16:28,889 --> 05:16:39,430
Which

3803
05:16:39,750 --> 05:16:44,500
What

3804
05:16:44,500 --> 05:16:46,979
I got him like grabbing the shoe out of her hand

3805
05:16:48,119 --> 05:16:55,419
How is that wrong?

3806
05:16:55,419 --> 05:16:58,139
Am I supposed to get him driving away on the lawnmower?

3807
05:17:07,669 --> 05:17:09,669
Like i don't know if i haven't figured that one out

3808
05:17:10,150 --> 05:17:16,630
It's fucked up though. I hear that okra salad raffle is going to shoot some shows on location next week around tinseltown

3809
05:17:16,869 --> 05:17:22,389
Now, I don't know actually where they're shooting. So I need you to keep your eyes peeled for me. Oh got another call. Love ya

3810
05:17:23,110 --> 05:17:25,110
All right, so I know what that one is

3811
05:17:25,270 --> 05:17:39,159

3812
05:17:39,159 --> 05:17:41,770

3813
05:17:41,770 --> 05:17:43,770
No, the blue fucker is always

3814
05:17:44,169 --> 05:17:46,169
A good choice. There's always somebody there

3815
05:17:57,189 --> 05:18:02,970
You could make it now sit down sit down have a seat because you are gonna love this here we go

3816
05:18:03,849 --> 05:18:05,849
There you go

3817
05:18:06,250 --> 05:18:10,360
Oh, I hope you're not busy tomorrow night. Well, it's a pass

3818
05:18:10,840 --> 05:18:14,599
To the opening night party of bar room brawl and club lingo

3819
05:18:15,240 --> 05:18:21,880
Nice i fucked this up last time now he is a hard ass so you better watch yours

3820
05:18:26,520 --> 05:18:31,189
It's not exactly my cup of tea, you know what I mean and you be careful over there

3821
05:18:32,709 --> 05:18:34,709
And remember you do owe me one

3822
05:18:35,509 --> 05:18:42,919
drink up friend

3823
05:18:43,240 --> 05:18:47,560
These are both great images that convey completely different emotions. I like them on the right foot

3824
05:18:50,419 --> 05:19:04,840
All right, so that's tomorrow night let's check out park at night hotel again

3825
05:19:05,959 --> 05:19:07,479
rosy

3826
05:19:07,479 --> 05:19:09,479
Let's try motel. See if we can get the alien again

3827
05:19:21,880 --> 05:19:27,049
No

3828
05:19:27,049 --> 05:19:30,409
What's this game about? It's a game you you're paparazzi photographer

3829
05:19:31,130 --> 05:19:33,130
And you need to take photos

3830
05:19:33,450 --> 05:19:35,189
of people

3831
05:19:35,189 --> 05:19:38,150
And sell them and celebrities doing things that are bad

3832
05:19:39,110 --> 05:19:43,740
All right. So it's a new week tonight. I gotta go to the club but today

3833
05:19:44,619 --> 05:19:46,619
Uh, where where's she at the mall?

3834
05:19:47,020 --> 05:19:49,020
She knocks the head off the amish guy

3835
05:19:49,500 --> 05:19:51,740
That's the mall, right?

3836
05:19:57,130 --> 05:20:01,770
It's the tensile town triangle with your host dink winkle steen

3837
05:20:03,060 --> 05:20:05,060
and bella star bright

3838
05:20:05,700 --> 05:20:11,380
Just choose the star you'd like to answer the question then guess if their answer is true or false

3839
05:20:12,180 --> 05:20:16,419
Okay, helen the first question today is worth five hundred dollars I think it's the mall

3840
05:20:16,500 --> 05:20:20,180
What was used as the model for the champagne glasses we use today?

3841
05:20:20,659 --> 05:20:22,659
Okay, helen pick a star

3842
05:20:23,860 --> 05:20:28,279
All right, let's go somebody else's time. I don't know. Let's go with the guy with his feet on deck

3843
05:20:29,240 --> 05:20:36,580
Who is that this one? Of course, every idiot knows it's Marie Antoinette's memories

3844
05:20:37,139 --> 05:20:39,139
excluding the one in the middle

3845
05:20:39,299 --> 05:20:44,500
I'm not even sure that i'm not sure it's that guy's legs. That's his legs. All right, we have a winner

3846
05:20:45,220 --> 05:20:48,900
Thanks for watching tensile town somebody else's knees in the air

3847
05:20:50,020 --> 05:20:55,139
skip

3848
05:20:55,139 --> 05:20:56,889
All right, here we go

3849
05:20:56,889 --> 05:20:59,509
mall

3850
05:20:59,750 --> 05:21:13,299
I think you win every single time

3851
05:21:15,540 --> 05:21:23,689
Where the hell is it then I thought I thought I thought it was in the mall

3852
05:21:24,490 --> 05:21:43,189
No, it's this one

3853
05:21:43,189 --> 05:21:54,520
Is that supposed to be the dog?

3854
05:21:55,000 --> 05:21:57,720
I would be that would be me doing that because i'm that close

3855
05:21:58,840 --> 05:22:00,840
Let's see if I can get the shit

3856
05:22:03,380 --> 05:22:05,380
That's way too close to the microphone

3857
05:22:27,029 --> 05:22:29,029
All right, so I need to be nice here

3858
05:22:31,459 --> 05:22:33,419
vanities

3859
05:22:33,419 --> 05:22:35,419
Because I don't want to lose my reputation

3860
05:22:35,500 --> 05:22:41,979
Or just don't

3861
05:22:41,979 --> 05:22:47,860
It's only 750 bucks

3862
05:22:52,979 --> 05:22:54,979
Still basically nice

3863
05:22:57,939 --> 05:22:59,939
All right, it is night time time to go to club lingo

3864
05:23:01,819 --> 05:23:04,470
This is philip

3865
05:23:04,470 --> 05:23:08,630
If you want to get into some of the places around here, you've got to get to know these people

3866
05:23:08,950 --> 05:23:13,029
You've got to make them trust you, huh? Otherwise they will give you no time of the day

3867
05:23:15,639 --> 05:23:16,540
Okay

3868
05:23:16,540 --> 05:23:18,540
Club lingo, let's go

3869
05:23:22,599 --> 05:23:24,599
Mike meyers

3870
05:23:27,000 --> 05:23:30,439

3943
05:32:04,849 --> 05:32:06,849
Well, who knows what they're going to use it for

3944
05:32:07,330 --> 05:32:11,650
Because sometimes they even put up your photos with an out-and-out lie for the caption

3945
05:32:16,369 --> 05:32:17,810
All right, darling

3946
05:32:17,810 --> 05:32:20,610
I I can't even react a controversial virgin

05:32:20,689 --> 05:32:26,770
Mary has just broken new ground in tastelessness with her new video for the hit song flex your love muscles

Tinseltown open is all set to go tomorrow and it marks the return of the great one to professional frisbee golf

3960
05:33:40,099 --> 05:33:44,099
We're gonna talk about did you see her face about condoms in school?

3961
05:33:44,099 --> 05:33:48,819
She just was actually laughing at that. That was great all the left wing garbage she can think up

3962
05:33:49,299 --> 05:33:54,740
You're the only garbage I can think up right now. Oh, I see we're gonna have a real discussion, huh?

3963
05:33:55,299 --> 05:33:57,299
Just like that real blonde hair

05:33:58,020 --> 05:34:00,020

Didn't I say this would happen?

3968
05:34:07,700 --> 05:34:13,220
What about condoms in schools? What do you think about that? It's the 90s kids are going to have sex

3969
05:34:13,540 --> 05:34:18,180
They may as well be protected now now mary that is like giving away

3970
05:34:19,060 --> 05:34:21,779
Crash helmets to people so they can speed safely not

3971
05:34:22,500 --> 05:34:27,700
Exactly. Well, I don't think anyone needs condoms. I mean only married people should have sex

3972
05:34:28,959 --> 05:34:34,400
So when it's my turn to vote at the courthouse, i'm gonna vote no just like senator frederick says

3973
05:34:35,360 --> 05:34:39,040
And I know some well-placed judges. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

I'm going to prove the powers that be that we can do whenever we want whenever we want we march to victory america

3977
05:34:56,720 --> 05:34:58,479

All right. So we've got tomorrow. We've got the park or the country club and then the courthouse

3981
05:35:14,000 --> 05:35:18,279

3989
05:36:06,950 --> 05:36:09,349
I'm sick of seeing it. We've seen it so many times

3990
05:36:10,229 --> 05:36:12,229
We've seen it like 10 times

3991
05:36:14,159 --> 05:36:16,389

I think it's still good

4114
05:53:27,750 --> 05:53:29,750
I instinctively took a photo

4115
05:53:32,069 --> 05:53:34,069

05:53:37,459 --> 05:53:39,459

If you've seen dean winklestein or his co-host valice starbright you may already be a winner

4120
05:54:10,930 --> 05:54:16,049
The on-air pair from the show tinseltown triangle has disappeared without a trace. Ah

one giant news for mankind

4124
05:54:38,200 --> 05:54:40,200
It's not a porn game

4125
05:54:41,799 --> 05:54:47,400
Every day every hour on the hour at six and ten for my two hour special every 15 minutes

4126
05:54:53,830 --> 05:54:56,709
Do you have any idea why my shampoo is so good for your hair?

4127
05:54:57,110 --> 05:55:01,029
No, I don't want to fucking hear it again. I don't care what makes your hair shampoo good

4128
05:55:01,750 --> 05:55:03,750
We're going to the bug

4129
05:55:17,639 --> 05:55:19,560
Well, how about this?

4130
05:55:19,560 --> 05:55:23,080
You know, i've got to hand it to you. You have got away with pictures

4131
05:55:23,720 --> 05:55:27,080
It looks as though I'll have to start to get busy again with you in town

4132
05:55:27,639 --> 05:55:31,319
Ah, but don't you get too comfortable, you know someday soon

4133
05:55:31,400 --> 05:55:36,680
Some new hot shoot will be along and then you will have to learn to be a survivor like me

4134
05:55:41,110 --> 05:55:42,799
I won

4135
05:55:42,799 --> 05:55:44,799
Not great. Not bad. Keep at it

4136
05:55:45,279 --> 05:55:49,430
That's the end of the game

4137
05:55:49,430 --> 05:55:57,119
I beat the game

4138
05:55:57,119 --> 05:56:10,560
eighty two thousand dollars

4139
05:56:11,540 --> 05:56:15,569
It's all good

4140
05:56:15,569 --> 05:56:17,810
Why are you still playing this because it was interesting

4141
05:56:19,009 --> 05:56:21,009
It was very interesting. All right

4142
05:56:22,150 --> 05:56:25,270
Let's what do I have? What can I do here? All right, I got

4143
05:56:27,270 --> 05:56:31,990
It's been six hours

4144
05:56:31,990 --> 05:56:34,549
Yeah, let's call it here. We're gonna keep going tomorrow

4145
05:56:37,189 --> 05:56:40,790
Because this is that I got a lot left to do and I don't want to start something that I know i'm going to spend

4146
05:56:40,790 --> 05:56:42,790
At least a couple hours two three hours in

4147
05:56:45,110 --> 05:56:47,110
So if you want to hear the plan

4148
05:56:47,750 --> 05:56:49,750
Here's the plan

4149
05:56:50,229 --> 05:56:52,229
I will be streaming

4150
05:56:53,110 --> 05:56:55,110
For the next four days in a row

4151
05:56:57,599 --> 05:56:58,799
today

4152
05:56:58,799 --> 05:57:01,360
tomorrow Sunday and Monday

4153
05:57:02,000 --> 05:57:04,639
Monday's stream is going to be the activity book stream

4154
05:57:07,520 --> 05:57:11,360
And that will be the last time that I will be live until the carnival

4155
05:57:15,430 --> 05:57:20,549
So the 16th is the last stream of that week. You'll see me again four and a half days later

4156
05:57:21,590 --> 05:57:27,189
Because I want to there's I have a lot of these things I still want to do

4157
05:57:27,430 --> 05:57:30,470
You

4158
05:57:30,470 --> 05:57:31,830
The next

4159
05:57:31,830 --> 05:57:36,229
The next like five or six fmv games will take us into tomorrow and maybe the next day, too

4160
05:57:41,810 --> 05:57:46,130
That was paparazzi. You know, I those are really really those were very very like

4161
05:57:46,930 --> 05:57:48,369
Those were good

4162
05:57:48,369 --> 05:57:55,090
Steven spielberg that was fucking hilarious. I I literally I actually hurt myself laughing at that game in the first like 45 minutes of the stream

4163
05:57:56,849 --> 05:58:00,049
This game was fucking all over the place, but it was at least worth looking at

4164
05:58:01,009 --> 05:58:04,240
And one or two others too, right I don't even remember

4165
05:58:07,459 --> 05:58:11,139
But tomorrow we are going to start tomorrow with one that

4166
05:58:12,340 --> 05:58:14,340
is

4167
05:58:14,580 --> 05:58:20,020
It reminds me of wirehead it's apparently a huge budget fmv game. It's called fox hunt

4168
05:58:22,150 --> 05:58:26,389
There's a lot and I already tested it out to make sure it worked it looks crazy

4169
05:58:30,560 --> 05:58:32,560
And I also have crime patrol too

4170
05:58:34,610 --> 05:58:36,200
and

4171
05:58:36,200 --> 05:58:39,479
That is like five six seven more of these you'll see tomorrow

4172
05:58:41,360 --> 05:58:43,439
We'll start with that though

4173
05:58:43,439 --> 05:58:45,919
That has been that's a pretty good place to call it. I think

4174
05:58:47,200 --> 05:58:55,610
Let's turn that off turn that off put on the outro and let's say our goodbyes

4175
05:58:57,319 --> 05:59:03,139
Do the bits hang up for a little bit

4176
05:59:03,939 --> 05:59:11,650
Little do you know that some of these just pop up with fucking ridiculous fucked up shit

4177
05:59:12,689 --> 05:59:14,849
But i'll see you tomorrow same time

4178
05:59:17,380 --> 05:59:19,520
Let's go back a little while

4179
05:59:19,520 --> 05:59:21,119
Oh also

4180
05:59:21,119 --> 05:59:23,279
Wait, don't wait. Wait, don't leave yet. Hold on stay right there

4181
05:59:26,229 --> 05:59:28,229

4186
05:59:45,669 --> 05:59:47,669

4187
05:59:48,529 --> 05:59:50,529

So tell me if you don't like meet and greets and prefer to hang out with fans

4197
06:00:25,680 --> 06:00:27,680
Does that mean that I should just follow you around?

4198
06:00:29,349 --> 06:00:31,590
Uh, well, I don't know if the word hang out with fans

4199
06:00:32,470 --> 06:00:33,270
is

4200
06:00:33,270 --> 06:00:39,009
necessarily correct

4201
06:00:39,009 --> 06:00:41,080

4202
06:00:41,080 --> 06:00:42,709

06:00:42,790 --> 06:00:45,029
Spend like an hour or two in a spot

4204
06:00:47,040 --> 06:00:48,319
or

4205
06:00:48,319 --> 06:00:52,080
Kind of just find me

4206
06:00:52,080 --> 06:00:54,639

4207
06:00:59,060 --> 06:01:03,939
Because I will I will give you this. I will tell you full-on completely transparent with you

4208
06:01:05,189 --> 06:01:09,080

4209
06:01:09,080 --> 06:01:13,720
I love talking to people and I love hanging out love getting grabbed and like hey like let's talk

4210
06:01:14,279 --> 06:01:15,880
I do it all the time

4211
06:01:15,880 --> 06:01:17,880
When I go to conventions like this

4212
06:01:17,959 --> 06:01:20,200
But I kind of don't know what else to do

4213
06:01:21,159 --> 06:01:22,720
You know what I mean?

4214
06:01:22,720 --> 06:01:26,159
I kind of just like hey. Hey, it's me. Hey, it's you. All right

4215
06:01:27,250 --> 06:01:29,250
I don't have any fucking idea what i'm doing

4216
06:01:29,810 --> 06:01:34,159
It's like that's just real

4217
06:01:35,090 --> 06:01:37,090
All right, we're gonna go over this way and

4218
06:01:38,930 --> 06:01:40,759
All right. Uh

4219
06:01:40,759 --> 06:01:44,080
Hey

4220
06:01:44,080 --> 06:01:47,599
Look at me. I'm just gonna do look at me like five times and then fucking leave

4221
06:01:51,459 --> 06:01:54,979
What if I did that? What if I just was I got everybody in one place and I was just like oh look at me

4222
06:01:55,299 --> 06:01:57,540
Look at me and then I fucking sprinted out the front door

4223
06:01:58,680 --> 06:02:00,680
And there was a cab waiting for me and it was just like

4224
06:02:01,880 --> 06:02:06,159
Just took off

4225
06:02:06,159 --> 06:02:09,200
and I just before I left I like threw in the air a bunch of like

4226
06:02:10,000 --> 06:02:12,000
actor headshots that I signed

4227
06:02:12,340 --> 06:02:14,340
I've got like 50 of them

4228
06:02:22,069 --> 06:02:35,939
Do it but no, I i'll be around i'm only gonna be there for a little while though

4229
06:02:37,509 --> 06:02:39,430
because the

4230
06:02:39,430 --> 06:02:41,830
Carnival stream is happening the weekend before that

4231
06:02:42,950 --> 06:02:44,950
And i'm probably gonna be pretty tired

4232
06:02:45,409 --> 06:02:47,810
Then I come back and i'm gonna stream

4233
06:02:48,529 --> 06:02:50,689
because obviously I don't I don't want to have a scenario where

4234
06:02:51,889 --> 06:02:57,409
I don't stream for a week. Then there's one stream and then what I don't stream for a week again and go to twitchcon

4235
06:02:58,290 --> 06:03:00,919
Like i'm not gonna not stream for like two and a half weeks

4236
06:03:02,049 --> 06:03:05,889
So i'm gonna come back stream for a few days and then go right to twitchcon

4237
06:03:06,689 --> 06:03:10,790
So i'm only gonna be at twitchcon for like two days

4238
06:03:12,119 --> 06:03:14,479
I'm not gonna be there for very long

4239
06:03:14,479 --> 06:03:16,479
Saturday is the day that i'm gonna be

4240
06:03:18,069 --> 06:03:20,069
At twitchcon for the most amount of time

4241
06:03:24,479 --> 06:03:25,599
I bring you candy will you eat it?

4242
06:03:25,599 --> 06:03:28,159
I will not eat anything that somebody hands me that I don't know where it came from

4243
06:03:30,259 --> 06:03:36,500
I've I have no idea where you got it for all. I know like somebody could have like fucking peed on it. I don't know

4244
06:03:37,909 --> 06:03:40,549
Absolutely, not I will not eat any food that anybody hands me

4245
06:03:44,549 --> 06:03:46,549
Here here here man. Eat this

4246
06:03:46,790 --> 06:03:48,229
Sure

4247
06:03:48,229 --> 06:03:50,229
Oh, what what where did you get it?

4248
06:03:54,020 --> 06:03:56,020
Oh, uh from a trash can outside

4249
06:03:56,659 --> 06:04:00,020
She baited and then I go to the fucking hospital for food poisoning

4250
06:04:01,729 --> 06:04:08,959
That's a hard policy, sorry guys

4251
06:04:09,040 --> 06:04:10,319
no food

4252
06:04:10,319 --> 06:04:11,360
no

4253
06:04:11,360 --> 06:04:17,540
No drinks

4254
06:04:17,540 --> 06:04:19,540
and everybody gets one

4255
06:04:20,020 --> 06:04:24,020
Photo where I don't even make any emotion. I just look in the camera with a stone face

4256
06:04:27,830 --> 06:04:30,150
And then if you want like on your phone, i'll fucking like sign it

4257
06:04:30,150 --> 06:04:33,509
Just open up like the the iphone thing where you can draw on the picture and i'll sign the photo

4258
06:04:34,229 --> 06:04:37,119
I'm gonna make that a thing

4259
06:04:37,119 --> 06:04:41,840
How about I do that?

4260
06:04:41,840 --> 06:04:44,479
I think that you know what guys that's I think that is new age

4261
06:04:46,099 --> 06:04:49,139
You take like a selfie with somebody and then oh, can I get your autograph?

4262
06:04:49,220 --> 06:04:52,659
Of course, you can open up on your phone that app and let me just go over it on on the bottom

4263
06:04:54,869 --> 06:04:56,869
Don't tell any streamer about that

4264
06:04:58,080 --> 06:05:00,639
I don't want any streamers or any youtubers or any actors. That's my thing

4265
06:05:06,080 --> 06:05:08,479
But now i'll be at twitchcon for at least

4266
06:05:09,360 --> 06:05:11,959
the day on saturday

4267
06:05:11,959 --> 06:05:15,439
Somewhere probably saturday afternoon. I'm gonna be all over the place

4268
06:05:19,400 --> 06:05:25,540
But thank you to the five dollars. Thank you. Zorro carlos for the five dollars

4269
06:05:26,180 --> 06:05:32,000
Uh, they say jeremy need to tell you about an awkward experience. I had yesterday at work

4270
06:05:32,639 --> 06:05:38,240
I was working the night shift at dunkin donuts and suddenly a literal bia walks through the door down to every feature

4271
06:05:39,200 --> 06:05:41,759
Tattooed gray hair beard dressed like a biker

4272
06:05:43,189 --> 06:05:47,669
Now the worst part is when he ordered a donut and said it almost exactly how the biaz said in the meeting of the biaz

4273
06:05:49,520 --> 06:05:51,919
I tried so hard not to laugh thinking about it

4274
06:05:56,770 --> 06:05:58,770
A real life biaz spotting

4275
06:05:59,490 --> 06:06:06,450
Oh and just no no big deal or anything just phylactery lich is going with with with their every stream 69 community subs

4276
06:06:07,250 --> 06:06:10,770
Yeah, no, no, not no big deal. Just just every single live stream

4277
06:06:10,849 --> 06:06:13,970
I've done in the last like two weeks almost 100 subs from phylactery lich

4278
06:06:17,380 --> 06:06:19,909
Holy shit

4279
06:06:19,909 --> 06:06:22,549
Still going

4280
06:06:22,549 --> 06:06:24,549
Still going you're still going

4281
06:06:30,549 --> 06:06:32,549
Holy shit phylactery

4282
06:06:37,080 --> 06:06:39,400
I could swim in a bathtub with this many subs

4283
06:06:41,520 --> 06:06:44,560
What i'm in pool. I get this is a swimming pool full of subs

4284
06:06:46,720 --> 06:06:49,040
No, you it's a lot of subs. You know what i'm trying to say here

4285
06:06:50,389 --> 06:06:52,549
It's a lot of subs in the same place

4286
06:06:55,439 --> 06:06:57,439
but

4287
06:06:59,430 --> 06:07:06,840
But phylactery this is too much money, this is too much money

4288
06:07:07,810 --> 06:07:09,330
Thank you so much

4289
06:07:09,330 --> 06:07:14,340
But it's too much money

4290
06:07:14,340 --> 06:07:18,759
That's fucking insane

4291
06:07:18,759 --> 06:07:25,040
BAN HIM

4292
06:07:25,040 --> 06:07:27,040
No, that's seriously. Thank you

4293
06:07:28,529 --> 06:07:31,250
Oh, I i've said this to you every time that this happens

4294
06:07:31,970 --> 06:07:33,779
but

4295
06:07:33,779 --> 06:07:35,860
If you can't afford this don't do it

4296
06:07:37,569 --> 06:07:43,009
You've given such a ridiculous amount of money if you have like 10 fucking mil in the bank right now then okay

4297
06:07:43,810 --> 06:07:50,580
All right. Thank you. This is their college fund

4298
06:07:51,650 --> 06:07:53,889
No, keep that money and go to college with it

4299
06:07:54,709 --> 06:08:01,599
Don't get why is my voice doing that at this point? I can clearly afford it or I wouldn't have internet

4300
06:08:03,599 --> 06:08:09,759
Wait, hold on implying that you can afford it because left over you have enough money to still pay for the internet

4301
06:08:15,569 --> 06:08:19,279
Jesus

4302
06:08:19,279 --> 06:08:21,279
I can still afford to pay the internet

4303
06:08:22,450 --> 06:08:24,450
the entire internet

4304
06:08:27,799 --> 06:08:31,000
Now you're a a ridiculous contributor to this stream

4305
06:08:33,380 --> 06:08:35,060
Thank you for

4306
06:08:35,060 --> 06:08:37,060
Your vat of money

4307
06:08:42,919 --> 06:08:49,840
It is just simmering in that pot. It sells diamonds. He's a diamond tycoon

4308
06:08:50,740 --> 06:08:52,049
maybe

4309
06:08:52,049 --> 06:08:54,049
Whatever it is. Thank you

4310
06:08:59,319 --> 06:09:01,750
But we will continue

4311
06:09:07,400 --> 06:09:10,119
Zoro carlos with that five dollars with the in real life. Yeah

4312
06:09:12,560 --> 06:09:15,520
Yeah, I mean that that's a character in gta essentially

4313
06:09:16,240 --> 06:09:21,040
And they made those characters because those those characters those people actually they do exist

4314
06:09:22,959 --> 06:09:25,040
They are kind of they they do exist

4315
06:09:30,479 --> 06:09:32,159
real bs

4316
06:09:32,159 --> 06:09:40,500
A while ago you tweeted saying that you wanted a slug woman is kim that slug

4317
06:09:41,880 --> 06:09:44,520
By a while ago. Do you mean like three years ago?

4318
06:09:46,450 --> 06:09:49,409
When you say a while ago that makes it sound like I said this like a month ago

4319
06:09:50,450 --> 06:09:52,450
It's like four years ago

4320
06:09:55,560 --> 06:10:04,439
Yeah, look a while ago you said I guess four years still is and it is a while right technically

4321
06:10:05,159 --> 06:10:14,150
That is true

4322
06:10:15,029 --> 06:10:17,029
Of course i'm looking for a slug

4323
06:10:18,630 --> 06:10:22,310
I don't want to go. I don't want to climb any mountains or ride any bikes

4324
06:10:23,110 --> 06:10:29,060
I want to eat a whole bag of baked lays and have the person sitting next to me

4325
06:10:29,779 --> 06:10:32,919
Not say anything about it

4326
06:10:32,919 --> 06:10:38,360
I want to silently be embarrassed about it and look over and oh no, no, no, that's fine. No, it's fine

4327
06:10:39,319 --> 06:10:48,340
He's avoiding the question. I just answered it

4328
06:10:50,880 --> 06:10:52,880
I missed this from earlier. I don't know how

4329
06:10:53,279 --> 06:10:56,880
But corporal boom gave 55 dollars and 50 cents

4330
06:10:57,599 --> 06:11:05,009
So corporal if you're still here, thank you so much for the huge fucking 55 plus dollar bit drop here

4331
06:11:05,889 --> 06:11:08,560
This is about four hours ago

4332
06:11:08,560 --> 06:11:10,560
What was I doing? I must have been so locked in

4333
06:11:11,810 --> 06:11:13,810
Thank you so much though corporal if you're still here

4334
06:11:15,299 --> 06:11:18,580
Just say kim is my slug woman

4335
06:11:19,540 --> 06:11:22,099
No, but that doesn't

4336
06:11:22,099 --> 06:11:24,900
All right. I said it. I just said it but kim isn't active

4337
06:11:38,240 --> 06:11:40,880
Kim likes to walk places and no no

4338
06:11:41,360 --> 06:11:45,939
What I meant to say in that tweet is i'm looking for somebody that like doesn't give a shit that i'm a slug

4339
06:11:50,500 --> 06:11:54,740
Anyways, thank you. Silent serenity for the 250. They say louder. That was during piper

4340
06:11:55,459 --> 06:12:00,080
Ridiculous. Thank you door cube for the 250

4341
06:12:01,250 --> 06:12:06,610
the glitched audio from the stephen spiritware game is the same noise I get in my ears when I experience

4342
06:12:07,569 --> 06:12:09,069
a

4343
06:12:09,069 --> 06:12:13,650
Hypnagogic jerk that thing where you're about to fall asleep and your muscles freak out and wake you up

4344
06:12:18,740 --> 06:12:20,500
That's terrifying

4345
06:12:20,500 --> 06:12:22,500
Because I know the noise you're talking about

4346
06:12:30,529 --> 06:12:35,889
Uh, thank you the tickles for 15 dollars. They say imagine a world where germa's games worked

4347
06:12:37,599 --> 06:12:40,400
I think we got some pretty good mileage out of east today

4348
06:12:42,819 --> 06:12:44,900
Besides the stephen spielberg game crash

4349
06:12:46,400 --> 06:12:50,500
They worked pretty well

4350
06:12:50,500 --> 06:12:51,380
and

4351
06:12:51,380 --> 06:12:55,860
I mean, obviously the piper the audio just not working at all. That's all right

4352
06:12:56,419 --> 06:13:00,389
Too bad the rat game didn't work. I know

4353
06:13:01,400 --> 06:13:04,659
I know

4354
06:13:04,659 --> 06:13:07,729
Unfortunate

4355
06:13:07,729 --> 06:13:12,450
That would have been an absolute crowd pleaser. I know it but thanks for the 15 dollars

4356
06:13:13,409 --> 06:13:15,360
Thank you

4357
06:13:15,360 --> 06:13:17,360
Like four broke today

4358
06:13:17,520 --> 06:13:19,299
What was the other one?

4359
06:13:19,299 --> 06:13:21,299
I did stephen spielberg director

4360
06:13:22,930 --> 06:13:24,930
I did piper

4361
06:13:24,990 --> 06:13:26,450
paparazzi

4362
06:13:26,450 --> 06:13:28,680
And that was it, right?

4363
06:13:28,680 --> 06:13:33,159
There's only three tonight, right?

4364
06:13:33,159 --> 06:13:35,400
Am I losing my mind? Did I play other ones?

4365
06:13:36,200 --> 06:13:38,200
I don't know. I didn't play any of them

4366
06:13:42,479 --> 06:13:47,860
No, not tonight only three

4367
06:13:52,419 --> 06:13:58,069
But thank you. Thank you swiggity swanky for the 250 this stream is the most i've laughed all week

4368
06:13:58,069 --> 06:14:00,630
But I have heart issues when I strain too much my chest hurts

4369
06:14:01,270 --> 06:14:03,270
Maybe that's why you have stomach issues

4370
06:14:03,919 --> 06:14:07,119
Be careful. Take care of yourself

4371
06:14:07,119 --> 06:14:10,979
Don't strain too much

4372
06:14:10,979 --> 06:14:14,400
Uh, no, this is a new problem. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me

4373
06:14:15,360 --> 06:14:25,319
Oops, I had like the colonoscopy. I've had a bunch of fucking tests and shit. I don't know. I've no i'm sorry

4374
06:14:25,319 --> 06:14:26,759
I just like hit you

4375
06:14:26,759 --> 06:14:29,380
And I really didn't mean to

4376
06:14:29,380 --> 06:14:31,619
Uh, i've had like stomach and abdomen pain

4377
06:14:32,580 --> 06:14:34,419
For like six months

4378
06:14:34,419 --> 06:14:37,639
That radiates into my back and I nobody knows what the hell's wrong with me. So

4379
06:14:38,119 --> 06:14:42,040
Try still trying to figure that out and it doesn't think I don't think it has anything to do with the colitis

4380
06:14:42,680 --> 06:14:45,490
So it's annoying

4381
06:14:45,490 --> 06:14:47,860
but um

4382
06:14:49,159 --> 06:14:50,119
Yeah

4383
06:14:50,119 --> 06:14:58,720
Appendix I don't maybe I don't think so though not where it's not where I get like all my issues

4384
06:15:00,279 --> 06:15:03,400
Stop sitting so much. I walk around. I I don't sit that much at all

4385
06:15:03,959 --> 06:15:07,959
Contrary to popular belief guys. I don't sit down for a very long time besides this

4386
06:15:09,000 --> 06:15:12,040
Besides streaming i'm typically up walking around

4387
06:15:13,159 --> 06:15:18,520
Kim and I will go places. We'll go do something. I don't sit that often unless it's right here

4388
06:15:20,419 --> 06:15:22,419
And remember I only stream like three times a week

4389
06:15:24,119 --> 06:15:28,209
Sometimes like four

4390
06:15:28,209 --> 06:15:30,849
But it probably has something to do with it. Maybe a little bit

4391
06:15:33,000 --> 06:15:35,000
Because this is a new issue from the last

4392
06:15:35,080 --> 06:15:37,009
Probably seven or eight months

4393
06:15:37,009 --> 06:15:41,729
Right before I left it was like two months before I moved out of massachusetts when this started happening

4394
06:15:42,450 --> 06:15:50,040
I don't know. I've had so many doctors talk to me about it

4395
06:15:52,159 --> 06:15:54,799
But whatever you just you know, we we keep going

4396
06:15:55,939 --> 06:15:57,939
Keep trying to figure out what the fuck's going on, right?

4397
06:16:06,610 --> 06:16:11,090
What you do when you don't stream I imagine you just wait in an empty room until your next stream

4398
06:16:11,889 --> 06:16:18,040
I'm just like an android that goes into a closet and like kim turns the button on the back of my neck off

4399
06:16:19,560 --> 06:16:23,400
And then a day or two goes by and she turns it back on and sits me down and I just boot up

4400
06:16:25,560 --> 06:16:27,159
in a t-pose

4401
06:16:27,159 --> 06:16:38,959
God, thank you gray tax for the 10 bucks. I knew the name lasso app

4402
06:16:38,959 --> 06:16:41,439
So sounded familiar because that's the name of a dog breed

4403
06:16:42,479 --> 06:16:44,479
That originated from tibet

4404
06:16:44,560 --> 06:16:48,240
Anyways, love you streams and I hope you're you are loving life and kicking ass

4405
06:16:51,279 --> 06:16:54,080
Yeah, i'm i'm having a good time

4406
06:16:54,080 --> 06:16:56,959
Things are going pretty well

4407
06:16:56,959 --> 06:16:59,119
I really can't complain that much things are going great

4408
06:17:01,720 --> 06:17:02,930
Thank you

4409
06:17:02,930 --> 06:17:07,029
For the 10 bucks. I love dogs

4410
06:17:08,049 --> 06:17:15,360
I really do s10w update slow update. Thanks to the five dollars

4411
06:17:16,000 --> 06:17:21,119
Hey, germa just want to donate before the big day. Hope the carnival is a massive success

4412
06:17:22,000 --> 06:17:24,720
Uh because I borrowed a lot of money, uh money here

4413
06:17:26,759 --> 06:17:29,000
I borrowed a lot of money from the mafia

4414
06:17:31,700 --> 06:17:36,180
Combine those two things to give you bits and I need to prove my money was put to good use because if they don't

4415
06:17:36,180 --> 06:17:38,180
They'll take my house and my kidneys

4416
06:17:38,180 --> 06:17:39,939
Good luck and I hope for the best

4417
06:17:39,939 --> 06:17:42,900
You already know what's next peace and love peace and love

4418
06:17:46,130 --> 06:17:48,130
Thank you with five dollars slow update

4419
06:17:52,180 --> 06:17:55,540
Uh, I can't think of very many things that i've been looking forward to more

4420
06:17:56,099 --> 06:17:58,020
at least in the last

4421
06:17:58,020 --> 06:18:00,020
I would say in the last five years

4422
06:18:00,020 --> 06:18:01,619
As I truly mean this

4423
06:18:01,619 --> 06:18:05,700
The carnival stream is that i've been looking forward to this more than anything. I think in the last five years

4424
06:18:10,159 --> 06:18:13,700
At least the last three

4425
06:18:13,700 --> 06:18:15,700
Why would you borrow five dollars from the mafia?

4426
06:18:16,950 --> 06:18:18,950
Yeah, I don't know why you would do that either

4427
06:18:23,540 --> 06:18:25,540
Not even live-action germa rumble

4428
06:18:26,549 --> 06:18:28,549
I think it's uh, it's different though

4429
06:18:29,919 --> 06:18:33,759
Because this is actually live action something something

4430
06:18:37,880 --> 06:18:41,000
And plus the live-action rumble was a long fucking time ago

4431
06:18:41,799 --> 06:18:44,479
Was it 2014 2015?

4432
06:18:46,240 --> 06:18:48,639
That was five almost five fucking years ago

4433
06:18:54,159 --> 06:19:05,580
2016 was I thought it was 2015. I don't even know my own channel. Was that 20 that was in 2016

4434
06:19:12,500 --> 06:19:22,919
No, how did I make this video?

4435
06:19:22,919 --> 06:19:24,919
What in the fuck did I make this video?

4436
06:19:26,389 --> 06:19:30,229
Holy shit. It was it was august of 2016 17 18 19

4437
06:19:30,950 --> 06:19:33,349
This has been more than three years. That's almost five

4438
06:19:34,150 --> 06:19:39,720
What did I say? I said four originally

4439
06:19:39,799 --> 06:19:43,119
That's been more than three years. That's a long time

4440
06:19:44,869 --> 06:19:47,220
but yeah, I mean I

4441
06:19:47,220 --> 06:19:49,220
This is a live event

4442
06:19:49,779 --> 06:19:55,060
That is not just a live event. It's a live event that has a ton of participation and a ton of work has gone into it

4443
06:19:57,169 --> 06:20:01,009
It's not just hey like for instance. I've always wanted to do like a live wrestling thing

4444
06:20:01,970 --> 06:20:06,689
But that would just be like a presentation a live presentation. This is not just a live presentation. This is

4445
06:20:07,650 --> 06:20:12,130
A live presentation that is completely and totally dictated by what you guys are going to do

4446
06:20:12,930 --> 06:20:26,049
It's going to be total anarchy

4447
06:20:26,709 --> 06:20:31,090
We'll see

4448
06:20:31,090 --> 06:20:32,369
I'm

4449
06:20:32,369 --> 06:20:38,680
I cannot wait to see what you guys do. I cannot wait. What was that like weird cadence there weird, but yeah

4450
06:20:39,240 --> 06:20:44,439
We'll see i'm gonna laugh my ass off if I get down there and set everything up

4451
06:20:46,130 --> 06:20:48,130
And this this is like a blackout

4452
06:20:50,759 --> 06:20:52,759
Here we go, let's start the carnival. Mmm

4453
06:20:58,400 --> 06:21:00,400
You would laugh? No, I would go

4454
06:21:12,150 --> 06:21:14,150
And by the way i'm looking up into the sky

4455
06:21:17,619 --> 06:21:21,380
Like it's not what he's fault. I'm looking up into the sky going which one of you did it?

4456
06:21:21,939 --> 06:21:26,689
Who did it?

4457
06:21:26,689 --> 06:21:28,689
He's cursing god

4458
06:21:28,770 --> 06:21:32,610
Which one of you did it?

4459
06:21:32,610 --> 06:21:34,130
Trump whisper

4460
06:21:34,130 --> 06:21:37,729
Which one of you did it?

4461
06:21:37,729 --> 06:21:40,040
Let me tell you I see

4462
06:21:40,840 --> 06:21:42,840
No, that was like eric cartman. That's what you're wrong

4463
06:21:50,360 --> 06:21:52,360
No, these guys are fucking pros

4464
06:21:53,159 --> 06:21:57,959
These guys are so good. They're incredibly talented. They're really really great at what they do. They're great people

4465
06:21:59,840 --> 06:22:01,840
I am insanely lucky

4466
06:22:02,319 --> 06:22:04,319
To have been put in contact

4467
06:22:04,799 --> 06:22:11,439
With the people at andy mark because holy shit. They are they are they're awesome. They are so fucking awesome

4468
06:22:12,979 --> 06:22:15,939
It's such a relief

4469
06:22:15,939 --> 06:22:17,540
Trust me when I say

4470
06:22:21,439 --> 06:22:23,840
Did you hire an entire circus? Not the whole thing

4471
06:22:30,209 --> 06:22:32,840
But thank you slow update

4472
06:22:33,560 --> 06:22:37,169
I hope it goes good, too

4473
06:22:37,169 --> 06:22:41,250
hunter johnson, thanks for the five dollars. Hey jeremy been watching your streams and videos for a couple of years and

4474
06:22:42,360 --> 06:22:43,639
now

4475
06:22:43,639 --> 06:22:45,720
Years now and you haven't gone stale. Keep it up

4476
06:22:49,509 --> 06:22:53,830
um

4477
06:22:53,830 --> 06:22:55,830
I don't I I can't

4478
06:22:55,990 --> 06:22:58,680
Do the same thing twice

4479
06:22:58,680 --> 06:23:03,720
Now I know that the way that I approach things and the way that I oh, what do I want to do that?

4480
06:23:03,720 --> 06:23:05,479
What do I think is funny?

4481
06:23:05,479 --> 06:23:08,599
You stay in like the same realm of what you think is funny

4482
06:23:10,000 --> 06:23:16,639
But if I don't think something's interesting or if I don't think something is funny, i'm not going to do it and I don't care about it

4483
06:23:25,830 --> 06:23:27,830
She doesn't care

4484
06:23:29,110 --> 06:23:31,110
I'm talking about putting like time into a project

4485
06:23:35,139 --> 06:23:39,380
You've been saying behalf of 10 years now that hasn't gotten old. That's well. That's what I mean. Like I

4486
06:23:41,810 --> 06:23:43,409
But we've moved on

4487
06:23:43,409 --> 06:23:45,409
I killed all the memes before

4488
06:23:46,400 --> 06:23:49,279
I like to try things new things different things

4489
06:23:50,389 --> 06:23:56,150
As much as I can right and obviously don't you know, oh i'm never i'm never gonna say the word be ever again

4490
06:23:56,229 --> 06:24:02,069
That's not funny. I've never thought it was funny. I can't believe you fucking think this is still funny

4491
06:24:02,630 --> 06:24:04,630
No, I do. I do still think that's funny

4492
06:24:05,590 --> 06:24:06,549
I do

4493
06:24:06,549 --> 06:24:08,549
I don't know. I don't do it all the time

4494
06:24:09,110 --> 06:24:12,500
What about speed not that on the other hand?

4495
06:24:22,159 --> 06:24:23,599
I'm kidding

4496
06:24:23,599 --> 06:24:31,520
I love all my joke children

4497
06:24:31,520 --> 06:24:42,150
Even the ones that don't eat their vegetables, but if you don't think i'm stale

4498
06:24:42,950 --> 06:24:46,869
That makes me happy because I don't want anybody to you know

4499
06:24:46,950 --> 06:24:49,349
I don't want people to come to the stream be like, oh this is like this

4500
06:24:49,830 --> 06:24:52,790
Oh stale shitty. Oh german 985. Wow

06:25:01,110 --> 06:25:06,470
Oh, yeah, he really needs to fucking like stop because like holy shit. I don't want anyone to think that

4504
06:25:11,189 --> 06:25:13,189
You know, I I want to

4505
06:25:14,790 --> 06:25:16,790
I want to be like an entertaining streamer

4506
06:25:17,439 --> 06:25:20,639
I don't want to be the guy that you talk about like I remember when he used to be fucking okay

4507
06:25:20,639 --> 06:25:22,639
And now he this guy sucks

4508
06:25:23,569 --> 06:25:24,849
No, I don't

4509
06:25:24,849 --> 06:25:26,849
Everything's still going just fine

4510
06:25:29,959 --> 06:25:31,959
Yeah, it's me

4511
06:25:33,880 --> 06:25:36,130
Oh wo

06:25:36,130 --> 06:25:39,459
I don't want to be he doesn't know

4513
06:25:49,029 --> 06:25:50,630
He said it

4514
06:25:50,630 --> 06:25:53,720
Uh-oh

4515
06:25:53,720 --> 06:25:57,080
Yeah, I don't want to be stale and if I ever feel like I am stale

4516
06:25:57,970 --> 06:26:00,040
Then i'm just gonna stop

4517
06:26:00,040 --> 06:26:02,279
I'm not gonna do it anymore

4518
06:26:02,279 --> 06:26:07,240
If I don't think if i'm not having a good time and if i'm don't think i'm doing something that I think is interesting or fun

4519
06:26:07,400 --> 06:26:09,479
I'm not gonna do it anymore. Why would I do it?

4520
06:26:10,360 --> 06:26:24,680
Do it for money

4521
06:26:24,680 --> 06:26:26,680
I I can't though

4522
06:26:32,720 --> 06:26:38,560
I have to want to turn this stream on guys. Like I can't just well, you know, i'll make money if I turn it on

4523
06:26:38,799 --> 06:26:40,799
I can be serious

4524
06:26:40,880 --> 06:26:44,389
What the fuck am I gonna talk about? What am I gonna do?

4525
06:27:00,159 --> 06:27:03,139
Just talk with the vr voice and we'll give the subs

4526
06:27:09,799 --> 06:27:13,319
Oh like burping

4527
06:27:13,319 --> 06:27:15,970
Yeah, no

4528
06:27:15,970 --> 06:27:17,970
No, no i'm not into that

4529
06:27:19,459 --> 06:27:21,459
once I had like running the shit I want to do and

4530
06:27:22,340 --> 06:27:24,340
If I stop having fun

4531
06:27:24,340 --> 06:27:29,919
Then i'm just gonna i'm just gonna move on. You know, that's not gonna I don't think that'll happen anytime soon

4532
06:27:33,360 --> 06:27:36,880
We've talked about this before guys. We've talked about this a few times before you guys already know this

4533
06:27:37,759 --> 06:27:40,759
You don't need me to tell you this. You know this already

4534
06:27:54,520 --> 06:28:02,950
He's already talking about retirement. Yeah, but we're in this world

4535
06:28:04,000 --> 06:28:08,560
It's you know, it's a very volatile world in the online kind of twitch youtuber

4536
06:28:09,360 --> 06:28:12,720
I don't know. I don't know what's gonna happen. I didn't predict I was gonna be on twitch

4537
06:28:13,599 --> 06:28:15,599
I didn't even know I was gonna be making youtube videos

4538
06:28:16,159 --> 06:28:32,520
I don't know stream from your retirement house. Maybe

4539
06:28:33,319 --> 06:28:35,970
If I can still if I can still have a good time streaming

4540
06:28:36,950 --> 06:28:49,270
I'll be 100. What would I do for money if streaming wasn't profitable?

4541
06:28:50,560 --> 06:28:52,689
um

4542
06:28:52,689 --> 06:28:59,060
I don't know. I figure it out

4543
06:28:59,060 --> 06:29:04,639
I have a few backup plans

4544
06:29:04,639 --> 06:29:11,529
I figure it out. You'd be a clown veterinarian

4545
06:29:16,520 --> 06:29:18,520
Why are you applying that to clowns?

4546
06:29:19,479 --> 06:29:21,009
animals

4547
06:29:21,009 --> 06:29:24,639
What?

4548
06:29:24,639 --> 06:29:26,290
but anyways

4549
06:29:26,290 --> 06:29:28,290
That figures up the note it

4550
06:29:29,009 --> 06:29:35,959
Um, i'll i'll be i'll be just fine. Don't worry phylactery again

4551
06:29:35,959 --> 06:29:40,599
Thanks for the 69 community subs and the 50 that you gave that I missed 15 minutes ago

4552
06:29:42,560 --> 06:29:45,360
50 more dollars from phylactery loaded

4553
06:29:48,580 --> 06:29:52,900
Jerma imagine if your teeth were flaccid and they only got hard when you were hungry monka s

4554
06:29:54,020 --> 06:30:01,909
That just makes me think about the rennan stimpy episode when they had when he has the the nerve endings all through his whole mouth

4555
06:30:02,549 --> 06:30:04,069
blah

4556
06:30:04,069 --> 06:30:06,709
That's the most uncomfortable fucking episode i've ever seen in my life

4557
06:30:07,509 --> 06:30:09,680
of any tv show

4558
06:30:09,680 --> 06:30:11,200
Oh, and they're like

4559
06:30:11,200 --> 06:30:14,240
Pulling them out. Holy shit. I forgot about how horrible that episode was

4560
06:30:17,279 --> 06:30:19,279
Oh my god

4561
06:30:20,580 --> 06:30:21,939
Yeah

4562
06:30:21,939 --> 06:30:30,209
I don't want to think about that

4563
06:30:30,209 --> 06:30:35,650
I loved that show though, but thank you phylactery for the 50 dollars

4564
06:30:37,540 --> 06:30:42,419
And all these subs that you gave there. We're about to see a bunch of them right now. Why don't we look at them?

4565
06:30:45,970 --> 06:30:50,240
Thank you everybody for subbing. Is it still september? It's still september, right?

4566
06:30:51,040 --> 06:30:55,119
I think so. Yeah, it is

4567
06:30:55,119 --> 06:30:59,590
Well, it's september is september, right? Okay, at least

4568
06:31:00,389 --> 06:31:17,520
Half off something you'd like to see some more serious work from me

4569
06:31:18,479 --> 06:31:19,840
That's the plan

4570
06:31:19,840 --> 06:31:24,740
Hey, remember we talked about all that stuff about staying interested and wanting to keep my streams fresh and

4571
06:31:25,639 --> 06:31:31,000
Make sure I still enjoy what i'm doing and still like doing this and care about it more and more and more that's how

4572
06:31:32,200 --> 06:31:35,479
Is to do more and more projects with the right people now

4573
06:31:36,439 --> 06:31:38,740
To always have another thing to look forward to

4574
06:31:39,299 --> 06:31:48,659
That's the idea kind of a trial run

4575
06:31:51,599 --> 06:31:55,599
But thank you to all mew for the 250. Hey germa longtime fan been watching since 2006

06:32:04,869 --> 06:32:10,450
Where should I be looking?

4579
06:32:10,450 --> 06:32:12,150
There you are

4580
06:32:12,150 --> 06:32:16,630
Why you haven't found me yet?

4581
06:32:16,709 --> 06:32:22,919
He's like under the stairs

4582
06:32:22,919 --> 06:32:24,439
That's fucked up

4583
06:32:24,439 --> 06:32:32,200
He's on the ceiling

4584
06:32:32,200 --> 06:32:34,520
He's tom cruise tethering from the ceiling

4585
06:32:35,080 --> 06:32:40,840
But thank you. That's a long fucking time

4586
06:32:41,159 --> 06:32:44,520
That is an insane amount of time

4587
06:32:45,939 --> 06:32:48,369
That is 12 years

4588
06:32:48,369 --> 06:32:49,729
Holy shit

4589
06:32:49,729 --> 06:32:51,729

4590
06:32:52,209 --> 06:33:05,009
Hey c4g, thanks for the 250

4591
06:33:06,240 --> 06:33:08,549
uh

4592
06:33:08,549 --> 06:33:11,590
If there were two guys on the moon and one killed the other with a rock

4593
06:33:12,150 --> 06:33:14,150
Would that be fucked up or what?

4594
06:33:16,279 --> 06:33:17,560
Uh, yeah

4595
06:33:17,560 --> 06:33:24,279
I think uh, I think killing anybody with a rock is fucked up. I don't I don't know where the context is here

4596
06:33:27,810 --> 06:33:32,549
But thank you c4g 250. Thank you silent serenity for the 250

4597
06:33:34,549 --> 06:33:39,830
Germa at the risk of sounding like one of those guys have you tried marijuana since you moved to nevada?

4598
06:33:40,549 --> 06:33:42,630
I had the realization the other day that it's legal here

4599
06:33:43,270 --> 06:33:46,310
And i'm a responsible adult kind of weird when you think about it like that

4600
06:33:47,560 --> 06:33:48,840
Uh, yes

4601
06:33:48,840 --> 06:34:01,060
I did that. Yeah

4602
06:34:01,060 --> 06:34:03,619
Don't don't tell anybody don't take any photos of me doing that

4603
06:34:04,159 --> 06:34:13,819
drug addict gambler

4604
06:34:14,159 --> 06:34:22,529
He does it before he streams

4605
06:34:22,610 --> 06:34:26,209
I'm calling the police. It's legal in nevada. It's

4606
06:34:27,709 --> 06:34:30,290
Recreational marijuana is legal in the state of nevada

4607
06:34:33,380 --> 06:34:46,770
So my mom told me to turn the stream off

4608
06:34:51,189 --> 06:34:52,310
I don't

4609
06:34:52,310 --> 06:34:53,909
You know what? Who cares?

4610
06:34:53,909 --> 06:34:56,549
What am I gonna tell you? What am I what am I gonna tell you that you don't already know?

4611
06:34:57,110 --> 06:35:09,590
I'm calling my mom and telling her how cool you are

4612
06:35:15,270 --> 06:35:19,669
That saying that you smoked marijuana is as interesting as saying that you just got out of the dentist

4613
06:35:20,470 --> 06:35:22,470
Like is it does it who well who cares?

4614
06:35:30,209 --> 06:35:33,250
Hey, I just uh, I just had a crown put in

4615
06:35:35,619 --> 06:35:37,970
Okay

4616
06:35:37,970 --> 06:35:41,090
No, cool. It does it does it feel better?

4617
06:35:41,970 --> 06:35:43,009
Yeah

4618
06:35:43,009 --> 06:35:44,849
Yeah, it does

4619
06:35:44,849 --> 06:35:46,209
nice

4620
06:35:46,209 --> 06:35:48,209
Is there anything else you'd like to share with me?

4621
06:35:48,290 --> 06:35:50,599
Yeah, I smoked a joint

4622
06:35:50,599 --> 06:35:54,549
Like an hour ago, too

4623
06:35:54,549 --> 06:35:57,029
Okay

4624
06:35:57,029 --> 06:35:58,790
How did that make you feel?

4625
06:35:58,790 --> 06:36:00,150
I felt pretty good

4626
06:36:00,150 --> 06:36:08,340
Well, I didn't because I was streaming i've been i've been sitting here. I've been live for like seven hours

4627
06:36:08,419 --> 06:36:10,419
We I can't do it right now

4628
06:36:10,419 --> 06:36:13,169
I would I don't want to I don't I wouldn't want to I don't

4629
06:36:14,130 --> 06:36:18,450
No, I know here here it comes. Here it comes though there

4630
06:36:20,130 --> 06:36:22,450
You drink on stream sometimes

4631
06:36:22,450 --> 06:36:28,689
Sometimes

4632
06:36:28,689 --> 06:36:41,360
Yeah, I drink like one beer sometimes on stream two boxes of wine

4633
06:36:42,479 --> 06:36:44,790
and then just like

4634
06:36:44,790 --> 06:36:47,830
Go downstairs to the fridge and like eat food and go to bed

4635
06:36:48,950 --> 06:36:53,779
You guys know that every time that I drink wine on this stream

4636
06:36:55,009 --> 06:36:58,610
I will drink a bunch of wine and then I will just go open the fridge

4637
06:37:00,180 --> 06:37:01,380
Give me that

4638
06:37:01,380 --> 06:37:04,259
It just eats a bunch of stuff

4639
06:37:04,580 --> 06:37:06,900
And then I just go face first into the bed

4640
06:37:08,159 --> 06:37:09,360
And just sleep

4641
06:37:09,360 --> 06:37:15,880
I mean, I don't look i'm why would I ever get

4642
06:37:17,159 --> 06:37:21,560
Like drunk to a point on stream that I would it was like embarrassing. I mean it's happened once or twice

4643
06:37:22,439 --> 06:37:25,720
But not that no i'm always i'm totally always with it

4644
06:37:26,880 --> 06:37:30,319
I would never drink to complete excess on stream

4645
06:37:31,430 --> 06:37:33,509
That's not I without i'm not i wouldn't do that

4646
06:37:35,330 --> 06:37:37,650
That doesn't happens a lot. What do you mean that happens a lot?

4647
06:37:37,729 --> 06:37:41,970
No, it does not happen. That's happened like once when I did the fucking pretend backflip. I remember that stream

4648
06:37:42,290 --> 06:37:44,290
That was a vr stream

4649
06:37:44,450 --> 06:37:49,650
There's only been like two or three true times where i've been like shit faced on stream

4650
06:37:50,130 --> 06:37:53,090
And it was that eight hour vr stream where I did the backflip

4651
06:37:53,970 --> 06:38:01,349
What about the labo stream?

4652
06:38:01,349 --> 06:38:13,029
Whatever that's different though

4653
06:38:14,549 --> 06:38:16,840
All right, let's get out of here

4654
06:38:16,840 --> 06:38:18,360

Then go for it
