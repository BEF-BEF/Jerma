1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:08,740
Hello everybody. Give me one second and we'll get started. Be back in a minute.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:01:42,310
Tweeted something. Got my drink. Alright, so today we're gonna be playing some

3
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:52,719
Dreams. I'm gonna try to play Dreams. He speaks. He speaks, finally. Yeah. I had to

4
00:01:52,719 --> 00:02:02,549
get this shit going here. Let me just move my character. We're gonna explain

5
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,180
what's gonna happen here. Okay. Let me just get it on the screen because it's

6
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,340
already here. Sorry, I'm listening to three things at the same time. So today

7
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,780
we're gonna play Dreams. I cannot guarantee that I'm going to be very good

8
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,979
at this. I did all the tutorials. Well, not all of them. It actually did take a

9
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:26,020
long time, so I think I only didn't do one and it was like the master

10
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:34,819
class one. So I do know a handful of things. Yeah, somebody said it took me

11
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,439
eight hours to do them. Yeah, it's a lot. So I am very much at the baby steps.

12
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,949
I've done the painting, advanced tutorials, the sculpt tutorials. I know

13
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:54,370
how to use the program now and I made something. You'll see it in just a

14
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:03,969
second. Just learn how to code. It really is. It is like a, it is

15
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:10,689
absolutely a full game engine. It is a full movie maker. It's a full game

16
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:15,129
engine. It's a full sculpting tool. It's like having every single one of these

17
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:26,750
programs and it's really, really cool. Now, what is gonna happen today? Here's

18
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:32,860
what's gonna happen today. I'll tell you. This is going to be a, I had a, I

19
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,830
don't know, I was trying to think of like what to do with it because I tried

20
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,229
searching. Remember I said, oh, I'm gonna look for like the tags or search

21
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:47,650
for Jerma in the title. There's nothing. Nobody has made anything with the, with

22
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:57,939
Jerma in the title. So there's zero. I made something, but I do want to learn

23
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:06,860
how to play this and previously years ago what I would do is I would just

24
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,939
spend two straight weeks in here making anything I wanted, learning

25
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,490
everything, making sure I knew what I was doing. It's kind of not possible

26
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,060
to do that unless it's kind of broadcasted out. You know what I'm saying?

27
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,379
Because think about it. If I stream, you know, three, four, five days a week, I

28
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:33,459
am not doing this and it used to be I would just sit here for like 50

29
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:43,060
hours and do it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. But anyways, I'm gonna go

30
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,470
ahead and show you when have I ever streamed five days a week last week.

31
00:04:49,310 --> 00:05:01,949
That happened to literally last week. Anyways, anyways, I'm gonna show you what

32
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:13,579
I have. This is the culmination of hours of work. I tried my hardest. I'm still

33
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:27,740
learning. It's not a dunk tank. I don't even want to put it on screen. I have

34
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:38,370
to. It's so bad. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here is my creation. It's

35
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,170
called scorpion boss.

36
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,819
He wasn't supposed to scream yet, but we're gonna dodge roll.

37
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,100
It's German scorpion.

38
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,019
I did something wrong.

39
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,990
Because he's supposed to go.

40
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:43,980
I beat it. I did it. That's all I got. That's the only thing I made. It's

41
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,899
really hard.

42
00:06:45,220 --> 00:07:08,430
That's again, again, how many hours was this? I don't know. Like one, two. No,

43
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,220
it was like one. It didn't take that long. Again, again.

44
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,259
First try. I beat German scorpion. First try.

45
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,980
The first time I haven't played around with the sculpt tool. Come on,

46
00:07:41,980 --> 00:08:00,939
give me a break. What is this music? This is Gwyn from Dark Souls. Worst

47
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,980
thing I ever saw. That was literally like I just had finished the tutorials

48
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:21,779
and I was like, I'm gonna try to do anything. There it is. See? Okay,

49
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:30,990
this is literally last this morning at 2 48 a.m. I spent all yesterday doing

50
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:39,299
the tutorials and it culminated here earlier this morning at 3 a.m. Go to

51
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:44,259
sleep, Jeremy. I can't. I had to make German scorpion. Anyways,

52
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,539
release. I don't think so. I'm going to come back and fix it. All right,

53
00:08:52,539 --> 00:09:02,090
so let's go back. So let me explain again what's going to happen today.

54
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:17,159
I need to see that. Somebody said the German scorpion face is what the

55
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,559
official German 985 popsicle would look like.

56
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:58,409
An ice cream bar. Oh, he killed me. Oh, my God. I'm never going to fucking

57
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,889
be able to not. I'm only going to think about that for the next like 30

58
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:06,409
minutes. All right, let's we're going to start fresh. I'm going to make

59
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,009
like I'm going to make something really easy. I'm going to make like

60
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:18,059
a rock. Okay, I need to start small. I tried to go way too big here. I

61
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,580
was going to make like a Dark Souls boss and no, no, no, no. I know I

62
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:27,629
got to start small. I'm going to make a rock. Okay, we're going to do.

63
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,019
I'm just going to I'm going to make a character. Although I didn't I

64
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,580
didn't even do that tutorial sculpture sculpture. Okay, I'm just

65
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:46,340
going to make a sculpture here. I'm going to make a didn't do that

66
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,059
tutorial. No, it takes like takes like two days to do these

67
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,240
tutorials. Okay, I'm going to make a character here, or I'm going to

68
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,710
make a sculpture, something that I'm going to try to do it as best I

69
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:05,740
can. So if you don't know how this works, is I didn't I didn't show

70
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,100
this last time. It's really important. Look at how insane this

71
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:51,899
is. Probably should have started with a square. Oh, god damn it.

72
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,990
Okay. Nevermind. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna show

73
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,580
you. I'm still learning. Alright, so anyways, the way that this

74
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,620
works is you have a literal smear tool that you can paint in three

75
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:15,960
dimensions. And guess what, you can also take it away too. This

76
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,460
is what was blowing my mind yesterday is this shit. Being

77
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:28,840
able to carve out almost like clay is really, really, really

78
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:38,450
fun. And you can do this with any shape to make a

79
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:46,919
Minecraft pig. Oh, lagging here. Oh, alright, so let's

80
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:51,240
start with I'm gonna make the fucking popsicle thing is

81
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,210
killing me. I need to stop using the flesh skin color.

82
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:06,809
Yeah, but it's like, that was like Doctor's Office level of

83
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,470
realism. I don't know what to say about that. I really

84
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,600
don't. That was like image and like sex ed class level of

85
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,379
like fucking how perfect it was. Let's start simple. Okay,

86
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,210
I'm just gonna make like a mountain. I'm gonna make a

87
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:37,710
mountain. Sculpt a frog. Well, let me just because look

88
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:48,240
ready to do this. Using the controller is kind of finicky,

89
00:13:48,240 --> 00:14:01,360
but it's still fun. Done. I'm done. That was fun, huh? And

90
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
there's a way that you can blend this shit together too,

91
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:16,919
which is what I should be doing. That's fine. This is

92
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:23,370
fine like this, because hold on. I need to go into

93
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,710
here. See if you wonder this is this means it's going to

94
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,789
do it's going to be a gradient essentially. I'll show you

95
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:36,070
see, it just picks a random color in that gradient. It's

96
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,659
pretty good. Now, you're probably asking, well, what

97
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,460
are these might be too small. They're not. They are

98
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,100
not the great thing about dreams is once these are

99
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,850
connected together, you can make them as big or as

100
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,049
small as you want forever. They could be an inch tall

101
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:01,299
or they can be 30 feet high, 100 feet high. Alright,

102
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,399
so, but I'm just in like the sculpting menu. See,

103
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,860
for instance, look at this. You ready? I can make

104
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,419
this as big or as small as I want. You can start

105
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:21,129
small. And as you see, this is pretty good E3

106
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,240
demo. Well, I want to go small because then we

107
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,470
can we can scale it from there. Okay, let's get

108
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,019
back in here. And I'm going to add and I'm going

109
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,100
to do whatever this is like kind of rough

110
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,299
looking. Don't worry, I'll fix it. It's gonna be

111
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:42,769
snow. Actually, I can I can make snow here. I

112
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:46,129
need a painting tool. No, no, no, no. I'm not

113
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,009
making like rocks. Yeah, this is just the rock

114
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:57,009
structure. Let's go back here. Okay, this is

115
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,889
just the structure of the rocks. I'm going to

116
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,340
put some more rocks on it. Um, what do I need

117
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,720
to do? I need to go to Yeah, this mirror is

118
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,320
fine. I need the color to be. We'll just we'll

119
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,759
do this. We'll we'll make it just kind of a

120
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,879
random color, random rock type color. Oh,

121
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,000
shit. This is I want this in I want this part of

122
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,059
this. There we go. Okay, so see, we're gonna make

123
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:34,590
a little bubbles on it. Let's get in there a

124
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:52,509
little closer. I mean, you might be asking

125
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:53,830
about it looks a little rough, but it's all

126
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:06,700
right. We're gonna do all kinds of cool shit

127
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:14,500
to this. All right. It's like little puff

128
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:35,460
balls. Looks okay. Hold on. This is snow.

129
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:55,460
No, it's pustules. Is this the snow? Was

130
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:08,410
this supposed to be the snow? You tell us.

131
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,900
I'm just experimenting. All right. Yeah, it

132
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,339
was supposed to be the snow. All right, get in

133
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:18,240
there. So this is gonna be different. This is

134
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,519
gonna be different. Hold on. I want it to be

135
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,980
the circle. And then we're gonna make some

136
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,900
snow here. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

137
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,279
no, no. I need the paint tool. Paint mode. I

138
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,160
need. What do you think? What looks like

139
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,940
snow? That's kind of snowy. Because then

140
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:51,859
now this just becomes an object. Okay, get

141
00:18:51,859 --> 00:19:05,480
in close. Let's see here. Dots. That could

142
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:19,539
be snow. And then just sprinkle that

143
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:23,900
around the top. Okay. What else? What are

144
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,299
these else? I don't know what these look

145
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,700
like. This is actually one of the first

146
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,640
times I played with the paint tool. No,

147
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:40,079
I think this is it. I do. So you can

148
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,730
take, you can have it snapped to

149
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,789
surfaces. You can paint it on

150
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,869
surfaces. You can have it. You can put

151
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,430
a grid up to have it so you can't

152
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,750
really get lost. You'll get like

153
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,069
snapped over and over. Well, you can do

154
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:53,589
the kaleidoscope tool, which

155
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,329
interestingly enough, see what it does

156
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:02,089
here. You can kind of make it as many

157
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,529
as you want spreading out. So you can

158
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:07,829
go do cool stuff like this. You can

159
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:13,579
make like flowers and shit. But we're

160
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:18,549
making snow. I think it's going to be

161
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,589
dots. Maybe I'll make them a little

162
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,829
bit, maybe I'll make them smaller.

163
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,009
Look, this is just to get into this

164
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:25,650
one of your things, you know what I'm

165
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,690
saying? Take our kaleidoscope. I

166
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,769
don't really know what this shit does.

167
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,660
Okay, tools. Let's go with the draw

168
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,220
flex, because this is more precise.

169
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,500
And by precise, I mean, if you look

170
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,099
ready, you can start small. And the

171
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,619
more you hold down right trigger, the

172
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:56,460
bigger the fleck will get. So let's

173
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,140
go ahead and get over here and paint

174
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,130
some snow. I'm just gonna Okay,

175
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,970
let's go with what's a good snow

176
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,549
color? I mean, white, like teeth

177
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:15,869
white. That's gonna be like teeth

178
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:19,950
white. Okay. And then let's zoom in

179
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:27,690
a little. And I want the dots. Now

180
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,950
hold on here. How to opacity

181
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,039
scatter. We'll do opacity scatter

182
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,220
is no, that looks fine. Okay, so

183
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,819
let's get in there and make some

184
00:21:46,819 --> 00:22:09,220
snow. Tilt it a little. I think it

185
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,869
looks all right. Okay, there's my

186
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:21,230
place. Why is it blue now? Why is

187
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,450
it blue? Oh, I didn't pick the

188
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,980
finish. Stupid idiot. All right,

189
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,210
plastic, shiny, snow is pretty

190
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,670
shiny. Yeah, snow is pretty shiny,

191
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:54,180
isn't it? Okay, seeing now how

192
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,089
difficult this is to do. Trying to

193
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,930
work in 3d space with a dual shock

194
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:06,210
controller is almost unbearable. Get

195
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:14,380
just get down there. Get over

196
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,200
here. This is driving me crazy

197
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,359
right now. Okay, don't just bring

198
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,599
it over here. Learn to control

199
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,920
it. I mean, I know how to control

200
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
it. It's just really hard to use.

201
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:51,710
Like this. I need to turn on the

202
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,019
snapping for this thing. There it

203
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,109
is. obey auto guides. Where is it?

204
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,009
No, no, it's not. I have to like

205
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,269
go like this. Come here. I did

206
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:31,259
make that very small. Smaller. Is

207
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,380
that close enough? Close enough for

208
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:43,710
a picture. I still need to rough

209
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,079
this up a little bit. Is there a

210
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,519
paint to surface? There might be.

211
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,880
It's just I'm still trying to

212
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,039
figure out how the fuck to do

213
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,119
this. Because this is sculpt, but

214
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,250
then paint is, as I said, this

215
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,930
is a complete learning experience

216
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:06,200
for all of us. There's a snap to

217
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,759
surface, which is here. Okay,

218
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:15,740
yeah, there it is. Well, let's go

219
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,539
ahead and do that then. Let's

220
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:22,519
get rid of that. So let's go

221
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,079
back to the dots. Make sure the

222
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,380
brush fleck is fine. Color is

223
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
not fine. Go back to white with

224
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,190
a shiny finish. And then snap to

225
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,059
surface is there. Right. Okay,

226
00:25:40,099 --> 00:26:05,450
here we go. Make a massive pig.

227
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,670
Well, I'm just trying to learn to

228
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:19,220
use the tools properly. I just want

229
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:25,819
to go in and that's all right.

230
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:26,700
But I don't I don't want this

231
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,980
to be one object. That's what

232
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:38,329
will happen. Okay, how's that

233
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,069
look? I'm just gonna copy it

234
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:44,210
anyways. All right, let's see.

235
00:26:47,750 --> 00:27:01,259
All right. Three snow things.

236
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,119
What am I gonna do with this

237
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,640
when I finish? Throw it in the

238
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,670
trash. Throw it into the

239
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:18,539
garbage can. Looks all right. This

240
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:31,980
has to come up though. Let's

241
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,700
make let's don't change this.

242
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:40,440
Let's go out again. Into what's

243
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,759
it called? You can just style

244
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,539
right? Okay, I'm gonna drop this

245
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:50,220
a little bit. It's gonna be an

246
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,460
expressionist pain. So I'm

247
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,180
doing right now is I'm

248
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,019
loosening up the fleck, which

249
00:27:58,019 --> 00:27:59,420
is kind of another word for

250
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,619
pixel. That one looks stupid.

251
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,579
But it don't matter. We're

252
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:11,740
gonna see you can make it. You

253
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,319
can make it a mess. Does they

254
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,640
make really fucked up photos of

255
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,670
stuff? That's okay. Let's go

256
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:29,410
into is impasto. Let's go to

257
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,210
tint. I want a better rock

258
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,619
look. It's coat mode. So you

259
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,700
can apply tints. You can apply

260
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:56,500
finishes. Looks okay. All right.

261
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,660
What do I affect? See, you

262
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,619
can use this. The weird

263
00:28:58,619 --> 00:28:59,259
part is you can make it

264
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,289
move around too. So ready? The

265
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:09,529
snow can be like moving. All

266
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:10,650
right. Well, now it's wind.

267
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:16,180
It's wind now. The rocks are

268
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,660
moving too. It's just missed

269
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,539
now. Yeah, it is missed. Good

270
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:43,109
idea. Back it up. It's gonna be

271
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:44,190
much lighter. I'm gonna break it

272
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:51,940
up even more. Okay, let's get

273
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,579
back in. I need to paint this

274
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:54,619
again. I need to mess this

275
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:57,710
all up. Where's the tool that

276
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,650
I need for that? I think it's

277
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,890
actually where's the damn

278
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,569
tool? Yeah, you can like

279
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:07,849
fray it out and really fuck

280
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,529
it up. Let's see. Ruffle

281
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:24,359
maybe. Yeah. Ruffle. Okay. You

282
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:37,460
can change the direction. Okay.

283
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,650
Doesn't look terrible. And then

284
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:50,269
we're gonna paint. Let's see.

285
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,259
This is just by the way, this

286
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:59,220
is just part one. This is you

287
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,099
guys understand that this is

288
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:03,839
the background for a popsicle

289
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:08,630
scene. This is what you do.

290
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,890
You just have to experiment

291
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,849
and play around till you find

292
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:17,279
something you like. Use the

293
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,799
brushes. Yeah, here's the

294
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,680
one problem, right? This is

295
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,440
the problem that I had with

296
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,599
this stream in particular. It's

297
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
it takes like probably 50 to

298
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
100 hours playing this game.

299
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,750
To know where everything is,

300
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,150
know how to do everything and

301
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,990
know exactly how to use every

302
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,829
tool. There's logic in this

303
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:40,819
game. There's actual logic

304
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,140
buttons and shit to connect

305
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:49,740
stuff to. But I think I just

306
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,619
want to try it, you know,

307
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,599
add background music. Oh,

308
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,519
you got it. Sure thing.

309
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:28,029
Holy shit.

310
00:32:40,009 --> 00:33:04,589
See, look at the speed. We can

311
00:33:04,589 --> 00:33:06,309
make a song too. I'm down with

312
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:14,700
that as well. Let's go back

313
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,049
here. Here we go. Playback

314
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:18,490
speed.

315
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,900
Bratz song, I might be able

316
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:41,180
to maybe. I hate it. I hate

317
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,660
it. I closed that out. So for

318
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,900
some reason, they had one

319
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,160
timeline connect to this

320
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,220
timeline. I don't know why you

321
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:53,940
just want to make the song

322
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,619
in one timeline. Let's, let's

323
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:57,940
actually get a song here,

324
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:05,319
though. A decent one. I'm

325
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,240
gonna make a little, okay,

326
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,880
here's what I'm gonna make a

327
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,750
house like here, but not

328
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,949
yet. I'm painting. God

329
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,639
dammit. So let's do, let's

330
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,469
just get a song. Something

331
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:22,059
easy. Make a Minecraft

332
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:22,980
house. I might, the house

333
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,820
I make is going to be real

334
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:31,409
bad. What? Holly. Wait,

335
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,050
is this like Kingdom

336
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:40,380
Hearts? Delphino Plaza.

337
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,699
These things, people made

338
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:56,579
these? Face my fears. This

339
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:00,780
is awesome. Animal Crossing

340
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,739
New Leaf 1 a.m. I think

341
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,139
that's pretty good. I think

342
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:04,659
that's what we're going to

343
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:11,070
have to look for. I actually

344
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,070
don't think this will play

345
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:16,099
when I'm editing. Sorry,

346
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:18,480
guys. Wait, wait, wait,

347
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
wait, wait, wait, wait,

348
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
wait, wait, wait, wait,

349
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
wait, wait, wait, wait,

350
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:31,500
wait, wait, wait, wait. I

351
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,489
need like snow. As the

352
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,809
congressional debate over

353
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,489
gun control flares up yet

354
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:43,409
again, we regret to report

355
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,570
the murder of a wife and

356
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,809
her two children by their

357
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,719
husband and father purchased

358
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,679
the rifle used in the

359
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,920
crime at his local gun

360
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,400
store. No, that's not what

361
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,599
I wanted to do. That was

362
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:08,869
that PT thing. Why? Well,

363
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:09,989
Seymour, I made it.

364
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:12,949
Superintendent Tomers.

365
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:14,070
Welcome. I hope you're

366
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,750
prepared for an

367
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,670
unforgettable luncheon.

368
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,940
Oh, you gods. My roast is

369
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:33,099
ruined. I want let's just

370
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:35,780
I want I need snow. I

371
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,420
don't actually know what

372
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,150
here. Let's go. I'll go

373
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,869
tags to like they have this

374
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,309
all sorted out here. Motion

375
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:46,550
ambience ambience. Here we

376
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:52,820
go. Lustre winter wind.

377
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:11,219
Check this shit out. I

378
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:11,980
can't make a field.

379
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,449
This is just in the

380
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,289
background. I believe you

381
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:26,000
can make a field play

382
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,679
when you can disturb the

383
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:29,860
distance. Right now, this

384
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,380
is just going to play

385
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:41,750
completely. It's very

386
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,630
relaxing. It's very nice,

387
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,579
but we're not done. Turn

388
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:49,980
up my voice. I'm just

389
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,619
going to turn this shit

390
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:55,170
down. Shit. Okay, so we

391
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:58,239
and this needs to be a

392
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,079
little more detailed. I

393
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,159
don't like it. I hate it.

394
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,360
I'm going to delete the

395
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
whole thing. Just kidding.

396
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:06,190
Okay. Sculpt paint. No,

397
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,030
let's do some painting.

398
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,630
Let's get some more like

399
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,670
dirt and shit on here.

400
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:14,780
You know what I mean?

401
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,420
Like, let's got to be

402
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,579
so like, let's get some

403
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:20,590
good fleck. I want like

404
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,909
a 3D effect here. Let's

405
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:26,570
put the kaleidoscope on

406
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,849
maybe like make a

407
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,730
fucking single goddamn

408
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,309
flower right here. No,

409
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:33,989
no, no, no, no, no, no.

410
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:34,710
Go back to sculpting.

411
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,389
It's my ADHD. This is

412
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,269
why I can't play these

413
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:42,690
games. This needs to be

414
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,449
the same color though.

415
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:50,130
And I need to blend them

416
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,960
together. There's a way

417
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,000
to do that. And I did

418
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
the tutorial and you

419
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,519
blend shit. You can

420
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,880
blend it. How I forget

421
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:09,989
not looseness, not

422
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,190
crop. There's a way that

423
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,710
you can make two things

424
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,849
blend in together and

425
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:15,929
can move them around

426
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:16,889
and they stick together.

427
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:19,869
It looks really, really,

428
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:26,760
really cool. I think

429
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,679
it's like the stamp

430
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:30,969
shape. And I think

431
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:31,730
it's like you go into

432
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,369
the hold on. Let me

433
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:34,130
just check this out

434
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:39,539
for a second here. Is

435
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,579
this it here? Like

436
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,340
properties, effects,

437
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,610
no, boil. It's not

438
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,949
boil. Physical

439
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,070
properties, movable

440
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:55,489
friction. Fuck, I

441
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:56,289
forget what it was.

442
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,920
Damn it. I might have

443
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,840
to go do that tutorial

444
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,409
again, because I know

445
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:12,929
there's a way that you

446
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:13,730
can make it. It looks

447
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,849
really, really awesome.

448
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:25,650
Ha ha ha ha. This is

449
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,329
it. This is it. This is

450
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,250
it. Varying looseness.

451
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,769
Yeah. Okay. This is

452
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:32,809
it. All right. I'm

453
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:33,730
ready to rock and roll.

454
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,570
I think it has to be on

455
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,489
a certain. It has to be

456
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:36,610
on stamp too as well.

457
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:44,469
You can put a hole in

458
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:45,750
it. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

459
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,269
I got to, I have to

460
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:52,679
do stamp. This is

461
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,280
pretty good rock

462
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,119
formation though. Okay.

463
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:54,599
I'm going to keep this

464
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,969
rock formation. I'm

465
00:40:57,969 --> 00:40:58,489
going to clean it up

466
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:13,079
a little. I'm going to

467
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:13,880
carve this up a

468
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:23,219
little. It's just gum.

469
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:33,269
Yeah. No, that's a

470
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:34,070
pretty decent rock

471
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,969
formation. Okay. Just

472
00:41:37,010 --> 00:42:08,619
wait. I'm going to

473
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:09,460
carve it up. Don't worry.

474
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:36,690
Pretty nice rock

475
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,610
formation. I would say

476
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:40,489
I got to just color

477
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:41,050
it the right color.

478
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:49,059
Okay. So let's

479
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,860
deselect. Yeah, guys,

480
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,659
guys, guys, guys.

481
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,019
That's, that's, that's

482
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:55,059
pretty good. Just give

483
00:42:55,059 --> 00:43:02,340
me a second. I'm

484
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,420
going to put, Oh,

485
00:43:35,889 --> 00:43:36,849
no, you bet your ass.

486
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:37,530
This is how it's going

487
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,349
to go. There's going

488
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:41,110
to be a fucking like

489
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,909
a little village right

490
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:49,679
here. And then there

491
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,400
you go. There's your

492
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,199
shot. No, no, no.

493
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:51,639
It's going to be over

494
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:52,900
here. I'll fix that

495
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,420
later. Here's your

496
00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:10,760
shot right here. Can

497
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,639
be like a little fucking

498
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,360
farm or something

499
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:28,079
right here. Can we

500
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:28,519
think we can make a

501
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,559
little to scale house

502
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,989
over there? Right.

503
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:31,670
First of all, I need to

504
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,190
make these the right

505
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:38,139
color. Don't you guys

506
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:38,619
know when you, when

507
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:39,940
you scale out of any

508
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,340
image, it don't

509
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,780
matter. This is what

510
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,699
this is the money

511
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:44,420
right here, right

512
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:58,619
there. I'm going to

513
00:44:58,619 --> 00:44:59,460
show them to shave

514
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,099
it. Don't worry. I'll

515
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:00,780
shave it. Just wait.

516
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:16,860
Just watch. Okay. Let's

517
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,340
get, let's get the

518
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,099
shave. Let's shave it

519
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:22,460
out. I'm going to

520
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:22,940
group these two

521
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,739
together because this is

522
00:45:23,739 --> 00:45:24,099
where we're going to

523
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,340
shave. I actually

524
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,860
group of these, you

525
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,860
know, just in case

526
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,820
group them up. Get in

527
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,659
here and let's get

528
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:36,659
sculpting. What do you

529
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:37,380
say? Okay. Let's

530
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:37,980
shave this up.

531
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:43,400
It needs rounded for

532
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,099
this one. That's way

533
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:50,820
too much. No, I need

534
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,500
like the filled

535
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:51,980
doughnut. There we

536
00:45:51,980 --> 00:46:05,570
go. It's like

537
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,449
carbon clay on a

538
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:11,409
knife. Look at

539
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,329
link, link, link,

540
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:12,929
link. What do you

541
00:46:12,929 --> 00:46:13,250
what do you mean?

542
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,739
What? What?

543
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:28,280
This really is

544
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,239
unbelievable. That's

545
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:31,039
unfucking

546
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,000
unbelievable. No.

547
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,309
Here, I'm going to

548
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:37,750
put this on the

549
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,309
screen. I'm going to

550
00:46:39,309 --> 00:46:39,630
put this on the

551
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,429
screen for a while

552
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:41,309
too. This is too

553
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:49,159
good. That should

554
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,079
be a new E mode.

555
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,099
Yeah. Yeah, it

556
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:52,659
will be. That's a

557
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:53,340
new E mode. I'm

558
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:53,780
going to literally

559
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,900
do that today. I'm

560
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,219
going to, that

561
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,099
will be the, that

562
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:56,500
that will be an E

563
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,019
mode you can use

564
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:03,440
tomorrow. Just like

565
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,500
that face. It really

566
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,780
does look like fucking

567
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:25,940
ice cream. Oh my

568
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,530
God. I'll, I'll

569
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,170
let that sit there

570
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:31,730
for a little while.

571
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:36,349
All right. It's too

572
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:42,420
harsh. I can, I

573
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,139
can change it in the

574
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:55,860
options later. With

575
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,579
the fleck tool, don't

576
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,300
worry. It's like,

577
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,179
well, it looks too

578
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:58,820
carved, looks too

579
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,619
perfect. I'll fuck it

580
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,340
all up. I'll make it

581
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,130
look better. All we

582
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:02,610
need is from this

583
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:16,059
side anyways. It's

584
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:16,940
really different. Give

585
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:37,389
me like a wedge. It's

586
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:37,949
still, I mean, it's

587
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:38,349
still going to look

588
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:38,909
kind of natural,

589
00:48:38,909 --> 00:48:39,469
right? So that looks

590
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:40,349
a little, but when

591
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:41,230
that's, when I do

592
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,110
some more messing

593
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,590
around with fleck, it

594
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:42,989
will look a little

595
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:45,969
bit natural. Actually,

596
00:48:45,969 --> 00:48:46,769
but no, no, no, no. I

597
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:47,489
want that to be

598
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:53,519
flat because I want to

599
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:54,000
put like a little

600
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,980
house here. That'll be

601
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,860
okay. I'll mess with it

602
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,460
in the fleck tool.

603
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,909
Okay. Let's see if I

604
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:07,710
was to be like up

605
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:19,380
here. This is a pretty

606
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:29,150
decent start. Okay. I

607
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,030
need to change this

608
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:30,510
though. We need to

609
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,670
mess with this. I

610
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,309
need to go into the

611
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:36,980
paint tool and I

612
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,340
want to make, I need

613
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,619
to make a, like a

614
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:40,579
cactus or something. I

615
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:43,920
don't know. We'll go

616
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,409
with, I got to get

617
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:50,690
the snap off, take the

618
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,809
snap into surfaces off

619
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:52,130
because I'm just going

620
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,010
to make something to

621
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,889
use in the scene.

622
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:54,289
All right. I'm going

623
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:55,489
to make a, um, I

624
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:55,889
don't know. What's

625
00:49:55,889 --> 00:49:56,690
your, throw me some,

626
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,409
give me an idea. A

627
00:49:57,409 --> 00:49:59,010
rock. All right. Good.

628
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:02,289
I'll do a rock. No,

629
00:50:02,289 --> 00:50:03,010
I already have a bunch

630
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,900
of rocks. I'm going

631
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,019
to make a cactus, a

632
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,219
pine tree. All right.

633
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:07,940
I'll do a pine tree,

634
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,579
but why would a pine

635
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,199
tree be out here? All

636
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:14,239
right. Pine tree. I

637
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:14,800
don't know what a pine

638
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,440
tree looks like. I'll

639
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,360
try. Okay. Pine

640
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,820
tree. Let's go. We

641
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,699
need like a straight

642
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:21,659
line here. We need like

643
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:39,059
a draw fleck. What the

644
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:39,940
fuck does a pine tree

645
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,139
look like? I know it's

646
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:41,940
going to get brown.

647
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:47,809
It's like a brown

648
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:54,159
base, right? That

649
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:54,800
doesn't look brown.

650
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,739
Oh, I still have the

651
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:58,619
hexagon tool on.

652
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:01,869
Kaleidoscope is still

653
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:06,699
on. Okay. And they

654
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:08,619
are pretty waxy.

655
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:11,099
That's fine. We'll go

656
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:20,000
with this, this. The

657
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,699
lighting is weird. I'm

658
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:27,340
going to have to do it

659
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,500
like this. I don't like

660
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,380
that tool. I don't like

661
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,099
this one. It's

662
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:31,980
definitely not this one.

663
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,340
Banes. We could make

664
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,699
a tree out of this. It's

665
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:42,179
going to make it

666
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:49,360
smaller. Okay. Hold

667
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:57,900
on. Expressive

668
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:10,909
Impressionist. It's

669
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:12,030
scattered around

670
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:17,599
everywhere. Change the

671
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,039
bootleg elevator music.

672
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,480
What are you talking

673
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,000
about? I feel like

674
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,639
I should just do it

675
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,940
like this. Just like

676
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,820
paint it up and then

677
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,940
add. No, that's too

678
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,860
that's ugly. Go back

679
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,500
to the paint tool.

680
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:40,460
Close, please. I just

681
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,380
get, I'm so, ah, this

682
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,340
is so many options,

683
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,300
so many things to do.

684
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,960
Hide everything else.

685
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,420
Um, I know

686
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,219
there are other things

687
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:53,739
to do. Just lost in

688
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,699
the tutorials in my

689
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:57,789
brain. I know. Okay.

690
00:52:57,789 --> 00:52:59,309
Let's do kaleidoscope.

691
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:05,789
We'll do three. Let's

692
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,070
just try this with

693
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,789
the color. Just go

694
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,670
brown and I'm going

695
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:13,949
to make it so it's the

696
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:17,710
draw. See that's as

697
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,590
big as it's going to get.

698
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:23,440
Okay, so let's just try

699
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,079
to make a trunk.

700
00:53:24,639 --> 00:54:01,019
All right. Looks like

701
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:02,139
a giant Jenga tower,

702
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:10,349
but that's okay because

703
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:11,710
then it sprays out a

704
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:12,750
little. No, maybe not

705
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,630
all the way. That's

706
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:38,780
all right. Oh, it's

707
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,000
a palm tree. No, I

708
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,880
need to have roots

709
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,170
down here. They got

710
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,369
to be good roots. No,

711
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:47,170
okay. Wait, wait, wait,

712
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,929
wait, wait, wait. We're

713
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:51,650
going to do just kind

714
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,449
of random color in the

715
00:54:52,449 --> 00:54:54,849
bottom there and different

716
00:54:54,849 --> 00:55:07,789
black cubist. I like

717
00:55:07,789 --> 00:55:21,460
it. I like it. Just

718
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,340
let's just see. Don't

719
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,059
just wait. Let's just

720
00:55:23,059 --> 00:56:17,869
see what it's it's

721
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:31,650
expressionist. Oh, it's

722
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,610
too quiet. Sorry.

723
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:34,289
What does it express?

724
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:34,849
I don't know. It's just

725
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:35,730
like a broad paint

726
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,929
stroke. All right. Stop,

727
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:37,570
stop, stop, stop, stop,

728
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,289
stop, stop, stop, stop.

729
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:39,090
Wait, wait, leave me

730
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:39,969
alone. Leave me alone.

731
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:42,460
Okay. This is done.

732
00:56:44,179 --> 00:56:44,739
We're going to start

733
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,170
a new painting. Wait,

734
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,690
is it there? Okay.

735
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,539
Okay. Now we're

736
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:51,739
going to do the top.

737
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,099
This is where we get to

738
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,300
be really, really,

739
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,739
really fun. Okay.

740
00:56:55,739 --> 00:56:56,380
We're going to go with

741
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,260
veins. Check this out.

742
00:56:59,260 --> 00:56:59,900
Ready? Get rid of the

743
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:04,739
hexagon. Let's turn this

744
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:08,829
like this. Let's just see

745
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:09,469
what that looks like

746
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:29,630
painting it. Don't let

747
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,429
anybody tell you that

748
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:31,630
you're doing it wrong.

749
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:51,619
I think it could work.

750
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,360
No, they're not

751
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,679
fucking pubes. No.

752
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,280
All right. Hold on.

753
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:03,489
Let me just see what

754
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:04,690
they look like. Edit

755
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,230
Fleck. Like I like

756
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,059
the scatter. Bring

757
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:12,019
the opacity down a

758
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:12,659
little. Okay.

759
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,019
You can make like an

760
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:15,059
expression, just bird.

761
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:15,860
You can do whatever you want.

762
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,940
These need to be smaller.

763
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,860
And they also need to be green.

764
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,420
Pine tree is like

765
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,380
super green. Well,

766
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,260
I'll do the whole

767
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,780
spectrum here. Okay.

768
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:28,820
Here we go.

769
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:32,059
So it just needs to be.

770
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,630
Let's go spin it

771
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,869
this way. So they go

772
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:39,230
down. And we're

773
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,110
going to put flow on

774
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,550
this too. What's flow,

775
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:42,349
Jeremy? You'll see.

776
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:47,309
Just wait. This.

777
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,610
I want to like move

778
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,570
it this way, but it's

779
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,090
like flying three airplanes

780
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:57,809
at the same time. For

781
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,090
some reason. All right.

782
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:00,369
Just tilt this way.

783
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,260
Why is it so difficult

784
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,300
to have you do good?

785
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,099
Go over here.

786
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,920
Oh, I'm killing me.

787
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:19,139
Okay. That's what I wanted.

788
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,150
We'll do. I'll put

789
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,269
me new music on in a second.

790
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:24,449
So we're talking about

791
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,130
pine tree. So pine tree

792
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,409
very sticky and prickly,

793
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:31,230
right? Who gives a fuck

794
00:59:31,230 --> 01:00:14,059
it's a pine tree. Spread

795
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:21,250
out a little more and

796
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,130
hide everything so I can

797
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,809
get a good view. And

798
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:30,429
this comes out.

799
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,019
It's looking, it doesn't look

800
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:58,780
bad longer. I think that's

801
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:05,980
good to check the sides.

802
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,019
It did look. Yeah.

803
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:08,059
It's a little flat.

804
01:01:08,059 --> 01:01:08,940
You have to make a little

805
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:09,739
bit bigger over here.

806
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,500
It was a little flat,

807
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,889
but it's okay because

808
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:14,530
I'm just going to come

809
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:15,170
down here.

810
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:23,550
Probably should have turned

811
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,429
on like the mirror tool

812
01:01:24,429 --> 01:01:49,519
or something. Every tree

813
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:50,239
needs another tree.

814
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,280
Oh yeah. I know.

815
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,070
The best thing about

816
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:53,869
this game is the only

817
01:01:53,869 --> 01:01:58,590
to do this once you

818
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,550
only have to do this.

819
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:03,780
Oops. Kind of screwed

820
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:16,750
that up. Come on.

821
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,179
This game is going to have

822
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:21,099
VR later. That'd be awesome.

823
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:25,579
Snapping on. I don't think

824
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:26,139
snapping's on.

825
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:34,610
Doesn't need to be perfect.

826
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,130
Just needs to get the

827
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:37,090
idea across because it's

828
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:37,730
going to be scaled

829
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:47,840
anyways because we're

830
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,880
going to put some flow

831
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,320
on this too. So don't

832
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,840
worry. We'll be good.

833
01:02:51,840 --> 01:03:09,340
All right. Not. I don't

834
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,059
know if that's really a

835
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:11,260
pine tree. It's more like

836
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,260
a bush, but it's all

837
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,590
right. Okay. So now

838
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:20,880
put this over here.

839
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,000
Oh, something's wrong there.

840
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,809
That's all fucked up.

841
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,170
I'll fix it.

842
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,300
That's all fucked up.

843
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,079
That's all fucked up.

844
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:35,119
What's like the erase tool?

845
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:42,099
Shit's all fucked up.

846
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:43,539
How do I erase it?

847
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,300
Is there is I don't

848
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:46,780
even know if there

849
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:47,739
is an erase tool in the

850
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:51,039
game. I really don't

851
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,440
think there is.

852
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,659
Well, I'll figure it

853
01:03:58,659 --> 01:03:59,139
out in a second.

854
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:27,489
Spider-Man.

855
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:41,039
How long before you guys

856
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:41,920
get rid of that one?

857
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:52,059
Is this the whole song?

858
01:04:52,059 --> 01:04:53,840
Okay. Fine. We'll do this

859
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,289
one. Which one of these

860
01:04:58,289 --> 01:04:59,489
is animal crawl?

861
01:04:59,489 --> 01:04:59,730
There it is.

862
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:40,460
Sing it. You got a friend?

863
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:45,460
All right. You got a

864
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,579
friend in me.

865
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:50,539
You got a friend in me.

866
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:58,349
But you got a friend

867
01:05:58,349 --> 01:06:00,510
inside of yourself.

868
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,150
But you got a friend in me.

869
01:06:21,099 --> 01:06:22,300
How do I erase this?

870
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,969
I know you can.

871
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:26,849
Here we go. Delete.

872
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:30,050
Delete. Ah, there is

873
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:30,849
an erase tool.

874
01:06:30,849 --> 01:07:03,380
Let's connect these two

875
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:16,739
together. Kind of sad,

876
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:17,780
but it's all right.

877
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,980
It's, I'm not done.

878
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,960
No, I forgot to do like

879
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,760
the fucking cool shit.

880
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,219
Hold on. The trunk is too

881
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:29,260
long. No, it's not.

882
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:32,860
Is it? I don't even know

883
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,139
what a pine tree looks like.

884
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,460
I think I have to

885
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,500
shave off some of this.

886
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,780
This is, it's too much.

887
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:59,949
This is like a willow tree.

888
01:07:59,949 --> 01:08:00,750
Yeah. All right.

889
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,949
Let's go shave some stuff

890
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:08,829
off here. A little too long.

891
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:22,539
Take out some of the bulk

892
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:23,100
from the back.

893
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:32,130
All right. That's a little better.

894
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:32,850
And I'm going to move.

895
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:33,489
I'm going to, I'm going to

896
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:34,609
fuck with this a little bit too.

897
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,600
No, Jeremy, don't fuck with it.

898
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,399
I'm going to fuck with it.

899
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,199
What's flow? I'll show you.

900
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:46,979
So here is where we get

901
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:48,180
to have a little bit of fun.

902
01:08:49,869 --> 01:08:50,510
I'll connect these two

903
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:51,149
together in a second.

904
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,909
But let's go to style mode.

905
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:54,640
All right. And this is

906
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,600
what we hit. Hold on.

907
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:12,340
Bring it back a little.

908
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:12,819
What do you think?

909
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:29,920
No, no, no.

910
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,800
It's turning into that,

911
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,039
that guy's hair from the meme.

912
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:33,760
What does that mean?

913
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,069
That's not bad.

914
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,970
I don't hate this.

915
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:54,850
That looks pretty good.

916
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,260
And then check this shit out.

917
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,140
The finishing touches

918
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,859
we're going to put on this.

919
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:05,140
You wouldn't even believe it.

920
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:25,939
Maybe a little too much.

921
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:26,659
Look at that.

922
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,800
It's alive.

923
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,640
That's all you need.

924
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,279
That's it.

925
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:34,239
Don't need anything else.

926
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:42,180
And okay, back it up.

927
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,529
Now we're going to go to style.

928
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:48,210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

929
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,859
We're going to go to coat mode,

930
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:56,020
finish, and we're going to get

931
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,220
some shine, more shine

932
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:57,859
on these leaves.

933
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:08,220
Look at that glistening.

934
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:24,529
More, more, no, less paint.

935
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:25,250
We can add some,

936
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:25,970
we can add like a couple

937
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:26,930
of little things here.

938
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,939
Tint hue glow.

939
01:11:31,939 --> 01:11:32,819
Okay, maybe this is

940
01:11:32,819 --> 01:11:36,960
what I want for glow.

941
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,760
Where's the glow?

942
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,399
Okay, color.

943
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:40,989
I want it to be like

944
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:42,430
baking in the sun.

945
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:52,989
A little burnt.

946
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:54,430
No, no, no, no, no, no.

947
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:55,310
I'm not even glowing.

948
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,670
I'm not even doing glow.

949
01:11:56,670 --> 01:12:03,229
Go back, apply glow.

950
01:12:03,229 --> 01:12:03,630
There it is.

951
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,979
Whoa, too much, too much.

952
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:09,939
Back it up, back it up.

953
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:15,250
That looks good.

954
01:12:16,819 --> 01:12:18,340
Now we're going to do the trunk.

955
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:23,010
Come on, you didn't think

956
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,239
I was going to make a good tree, did you?

957
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:27,359
You didn't think I was going to make

958
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:28,239
a decent tree.

959
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,279
And this is the roots are there

960
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:30,239
for a very specific green.

961
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,039
Watch, I'm not done.

962
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:38,270
This one, no.

963
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:44,300
We're going to change this a little bit.

964
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,300
I want to,

965
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,739
let's go into the tool menu here.

966
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:52,829
It's actually terrible.

967
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:54,270
All right, I'm turning on

968
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,949
the ice cream going on.

969
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,140
Hold on a second.

970
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:05,859
Hold on a second.

971
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:06,659
Hold on, hold on.

972
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:35,180
No, this was checking.

973
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:35,899
I just wanted to know.

974
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:37,100
Just was curious to see what it looked like.

975
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:38,779
We're going to make this

976
01:13:38,779 --> 01:13:39,420
a little smoother.

977
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,220
We're going to ruffle

978
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,579
the black up a little bit.

979
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,439
So let's go ahead and do that now.

980
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:51,899
Color is fine.

981
01:13:51,899 --> 01:13:52,779
The finish is fine.

982
01:13:52,779 --> 01:13:53,500
Tint is fine.

983
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,020
Actually, I want it to be a little lighter.

984
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,380
Let's go to from here to here.

985
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,380
Let's see if we can make this a little lighter.

986
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,060
There we go.

987
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:09,949
That's more of like a wood look.

988
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,640
Don't you just want to take

989
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,359
these little wood chips

990
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:14,239
and just chew them up?

991
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:14,560
I do.

992
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,930
Okay, back it up into,

993
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,529
we don't need any effects on this one.

994
01:14:20,529 --> 01:14:23,329
We just need to loosen it up a little.

995
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:30,850
Mmm.

996
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,729
Actually tighten it up.

997
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:45,310
It's already tight enough already.

998
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:57,380
I don't hate that.

999
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:05,819
I don't hate that.

1000
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:10,140
Yeah, it's a little crooked,

1001
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:10,699
but it's okay.

1002
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:22,739
There we go.

1003
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,939
Now it's wood.

1004
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,300
It's square like wood.

1005
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,420
Now let's hold on.

1006
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:33,939
I'll fix it.

1007
01:15:33,939 --> 01:15:35,140
I'll make it straight.

1008
01:15:35,779 --> 01:15:52,770
Too big.

1009
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:53,970
Top needs to be shaved a little.

1010
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:01,659
Now this is what we're going to do here.

1011
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:04,470
Oops.

1012
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:11,409
That needs to be way smothered.

1013
01:16:11,409 --> 01:16:13,489
I just combed all the flecks like down.

1014
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:15,729
Never mind.

1015
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:17,729
Nope.

1016
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:29,039
Now it's just turning into sheet metal.

1017
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,789
No, tight flecks are fine.

1018
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,789
That looks more like a trunk.

1019
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:42,270
Okay, let's stick this over here

1020
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:42,909
and combine them.

1021
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:47,329
I think we're good one.

1022
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:47,970
Tint.

1023
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,489
We don't need any effects on here.

1024
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:52,000
Unless I want to add,

1025
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,100
all right, let me straighten it.

1026
01:16:54,659 --> 01:17:02,850
I don't think this ever can be straight.

1027
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:07,569
Is this like an optical illusion?

1028
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:08,770
How do I make this straight?

1029
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:17,869
Oh, come on.

1030
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:19,880
What?

1031
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,189
What?

1032
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:30,710
This is an optical illusion.

1033
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:40,369
It don't matter.

1034
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:41,649
All right, we're going to just combine it.

1035
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,890
Make sure it's in the right spot.

1036
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:54,020
I almost think the bottom

1037
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,380
should be frayed out a little more.

1038
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:55,939
Don't you think?

1039
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,369
I think so.

1040
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:34,930
Maybe a little bit higher.

1041
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:50,630
I think that's it.

1042
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:51,350
I think we got it.

1043
01:18:52,149 --> 01:19:00,100
Perfect.

1044
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,340
Done.

1045
01:19:00,899 --> 01:19:05,750
Why are you spending two hours making a tree?

1046
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,149
Why not?

1047
01:19:12,819 --> 01:19:13,380
Why not?

1048
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,899
It's fun.

1049
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:18,710
I think you're describing this whole game.

1050
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,149
That's the whole game.

1051
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,899
All right, that's it.

1052
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:25,189
Here's the tree.

1053
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:28,979
So that two hours.

1054
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:31,060
I haven't even lived for two hours.

1055
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,140
What are you talking about?

1056
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:33,939
All right, so that's good.

1057
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:34,500
Where's that going to go?

1058
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:37,859
Here's the beauty of this.

1059
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,260
And I can go in and change these two.

1060
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,460
They're all identical.

1061
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,500
Don't you worry about that?

1062
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,020
You don't think I fucking thought about that?

1063
01:20:06,579 --> 01:20:07,619
You don't think I thought about that?

1064
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:12,500
Don't worry.

1065
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:18,100
Because these are all grouped,

1066
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:18,819
I can go in

1067
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:21,140
and watch ready.

1068
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:22,819
Just change this one.

1069
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,979
So let's select this one.

1070
01:20:24,979 --> 01:20:26,560
Let's like go into it.

1071
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:29,119
And then see how I have both of these.

1072
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:31,840
Now, go ahead and pull up that menu we had before.

1073
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,960
The style menu.

1074
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,479
Loosen it up.

1075
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,199
Ruffle some feathers a little bit.

1076
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,010
Can even add some to it.

1077
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,199
And that's done.

1078
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:50,600
Different.

1079
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,239
Now I can copy this one if I really so desire.

1080
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:04,020
Oops.

1081
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:18,899
I can't tell the difference.

1082
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:21,060
Well, look, if I really wanted to spend time,

1083
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:21,859
I could do this.

1084
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:24,659
You really want me to do this again?

1085
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:27,029
Because this is how I do it.

1086
01:21:27,029 --> 01:21:30,960
Look, I make another watch.

1087
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,920
You want me to do it again?

1088
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:35,170
Because I already have an object there now

1089
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:35,890
that's ready to go.

1090
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:38,689
And I could make like two or three more tree leaves.

1091
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,659
I'm going to make, no, no, no.

1092
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:04,800
Look, this is just for the like, oops.

1093
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,420
I don't even want those there.

1094
01:22:10,979 --> 01:22:16,770
No, okay, get rid of these two

1095
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,729
because these two are different.

1096
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:22,560
These, and they flow too.

1097
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,119
All right.

1098
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:25,279
First of all, this, we're going to change this to stone.

1099
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:26,000
It's freaking me out.

1100
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:33,109
Oops, that was just, that was the ambient sound.

1101
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:34,789
I thought that was fucking, you got a friend in me.

1102
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,880
You got a friend in me.

1103
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,279
All right.

1104
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,859
Now I'm going to RIP Fleshy Ground.

1105
01:22:45,859 --> 01:22:47,140
No, we can't just have the ground

1106
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,500
be looking like that this whole time.

1107
01:22:53,729 --> 01:23:00,550
I need, I need to animate this.

1108
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:01,750
Okay, let's get to the beginning.

1109
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:15,199
Okay, let's see how that looks.

1110
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:19,760
It looks good.

1111
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,739
I'm going to make a cubert.

1112
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:34,180
Oh, I want to make cubert now.

1113
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,699
I want to make a cubert level.

1114
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:36,979
No, no, no, focus first.

1115
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,500
Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.

1116
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:47,750
So this is what it looks like alive, living scene.

1117
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:51,109
And I'm going to like make this look fucking sick.

1118
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:51,750
I can't wait.

1119
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:55,479
All right, let's change this

1120
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:57,319
because this is, I'm going to put something here.

1121
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,789
Do cubert or RIP.

1122
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:02,069
We'll make cubert at the end.

1123
01:24:02,069 --> 01:24:03,270
You can just hang out on top of the mountain.

1124
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:05,350
I could redo that, the smoking shit up there too.

1125
01:24:05,989 --> 01:24:11,239
All right, so this and I'm going to make it to the level.

1126
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,279
It's going to be a platform level

1127
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:13,159
to get to the top of the mountain.

1128
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:15,239
Just I'm biting off way more than I can chew.

1129
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:26,279
Okay, I need, I need to go to the coat tint

1130
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:33,479
and we need to make this shit not skin like flesh color.

1131
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:37,029
What color do I want?

1132
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,569
Maybe they could be like a little blue.

1133
01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:45,090
Like kind of like this.

1134
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,010
It's supposed to be snowy.

1135
01:24:47,729 --> 01:24:52,920
It could be like cold and snowy and shit.

1136
01:24:53,720 --> 01:25:03,720
Let's try this one.

1137
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:27,750
It's like ice.

1138
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,470
All right, hold on.

1139
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:31,439
Let's bring it back a little.

1140
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:33,039
I need to, this needs to be flatter.

1141
01:25:38,369 --> 01:25:38,850
That's good.

1142
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:41,159
You know what?

1143
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:41,479
Fuck it.

1144
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:59,159
Let's, now that makes more sense.

1145
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:03,600
Now let me go back into style mode

1146
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,600
and let's change this, make it look a little better.

1147
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,479
This looks like shit.

1148
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:16,020
That looks way worse.

1149
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:54,710
No, it's going to be flat.

1150
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,199
Let's flatten this out.

1151
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,439
And I'm going to, I think I'm going to apply some fleck here.

1152
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,359
Yeah, we're going to apply a little fleck

1153
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,199
and it's going to be the square.

1154
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:26,039
Let's see, is that doing anything?

1155
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,340
I don't think it's doing anything.

1156
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:33,760
I feel like I should just,

1157
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,960
how did I fuck that up in the first place?

1158
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,880
This, you know what I mean?

1159
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:41,810
Why is it like that?

1160
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:44,529
I think I have to, yeah, it was in here.

1161
01:27:46,199 --> 01:27:53,159
Right, yeah, looseness, looseness and varying looseness.

1162
01:27:53,880 --> 01:28:00,310
It's kind of irredeemable at the moment though.

1163
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:06,770
Wait, what are you doing?

1164
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:15,350
Hey, hey, I don't want to put a circle here.

1165
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,909
What are you doing?

1166
01:28:18,979 --> 01:28:20,100
I want to edit this.

1167
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:25,300
Wait a second.

1168
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,039
There we go.

1169
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm confused.

1170
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,640
Why is it not,

1171
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:50,960
shouldn't I be able just to edit this one?

1172
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,010
Because that's what it looks like I'm doing.

1173
01:28:55,569 --> 01:29:00,020
Is there a reason why I can't change that back

1174
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,300
or am I changing it back?

1175
01:29:04,869 --> 01:29:07,189
Is it happening and I just don't, I'm just dumb?

1176
01:29:07,829 --> 01:29:09,350
No, see, it's happening to that one.

1177
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,909
See what I'm saying?

1178
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:13,510
Shouldn't that be doing the smoothness on this one too?

1179
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:19,399
Oh, it's because I need to be on the stamp tool.

1180
01:29:19,399 --> 01:29:20,119
Right, right, right.

1181
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:23,079
Okay, I will forget that a bunch of times.

1182
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:23,560
Don't worry.

1183
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,039
Stamp, there it is.

1184
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,479
Okay, now I can go in and make this smoother.

1185
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,210
Technically, right, should I?

1186
01:29:42,819 --> 01:29:48,840
Wait, why is this not working?

1187
01:30:01,859 --> 01:30:04,020
I don't understand why I can't change the properties here.

1188
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:12,979
I have no idea why.

1189
01:30:12,979 --> 01:30:14,420
I have absolutely no clue

1190
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,770
because it's making me change this one.

1191
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:44,039
Put it inside the other shape and just combine them.

1192
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,029
I guess I could do that.

1193
01:30:47,029 --> 01:30:48,869
I feel like there's an easier way to do it though.

1194
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:56,819
Okay, now edit shape.

1195
01:30:56,819 --> 01:31:04,069
No, maybe it is affecting it.

1196
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:08,050
No, it's not.

1197
01:31:08,609 --> 01:31:13,760
Well, unfortunately, I have no idea.

1198
01:31:15,619 --> 01:31:16,579
I have no clue.

1199
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:19,699
I'm gonna have to go back and watch tutorials again

1200
01:31:19,699 --> 01:31:26,079
because I don't have a single fucking clue.

1201
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,359
I changed it before and now I can't change it back

1202
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:30,960
for some reason.

1203
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,619
Mmm, oh well.

1204
01:31:35,619 --> 01:31:38,680
Am I scoped in?

1205
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,199
Yo, yeah, I am now.

1206
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:44,119
Like I was here, I'm scoped in again.

1207
01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:46,529
Is it because they grouped?

1208
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:57,649
See, like, maybe just edit the object outside of sculpt mode.

1209
01:31:57,649 --> 01:32:00,550
Um, edit sculpture.

1210
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:01,430
Will this work now?

1211
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:09,800
I don't think so.

1212
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,000
It looks like it's doing something but

1213
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,520
maybe I just fucked it up too much that it can't do it anymore.

1214
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:22,050
I guess it is doing it.

1215
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:26,880
Yeah, it is.

1216
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,140
I think I just screwed with it too much.

1217
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:32,739
Oh well.

1218
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:37,140
It's editing the tool that I'm using.

1219
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:39,939
Yeah, but is there no way for me to revert this back to

1220
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:41,699
the way that it was before?

1221
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:43,750
It's all right.

1222
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:48,600
Let's keep going.

1223
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:50,640
All right, what's next?

1224
01:32:55,880 --> 01:33:05,170
L1 plus square, invisible, movable, collision labels, audio.

1225
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:08,609
No, maybe, hold on.

1226
01:33:08,609 --> 01:33:10,210
Scope in and then L1 square.

1227
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:12,210
All right, hold on a second here.

1228
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:13,890
Tint amount.

1229
01:33:15,399 --> 01:33:16,279
Shine and, all right, hold on.

1230
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:18,359
This is the actual, like, menu menu of this thing.

1231
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,159
Waxiness, metalness.

1232
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,039
Okay.

1233
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:25,810
Roughness.

1234
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:29,000
That looks kind of cool.

1235
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:31,750
Hue cycle.

1236
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,989
I feel like I don't want to screw with this.

1237
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:39,920
This is the fleck properties.

1238
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:46,100
I don't think this is going to work.

1239
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:46,979
Looseness.

1240
01:33:46,979 --> 01:33:48,020
Fleck perspective.

1241
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:48,520
Whoa!

1242
01:33:55,489 --> 01:33:58,770
Yeah, I have to have, like, big flecks that I can't really shrink.

1243
01:34:03,649 --> 01:34:04,289
Flex, no.

1244
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:07,939
Friction.

1245
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,539
No, I feel like I may have gone too far on it.

1246
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,899
It's possible.

1247
01:34:17,699 --> 01:34:23,250
I can change the, I'll make it a little different.

1248
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,390
Waxiness.

1249
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,430
Yeah, it's all good.

1250
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:29,779
It's all good.

1251
01:34:30,579 --> 01:34:32,600
That looks all right.

1252
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,159
It looks fine.

1253
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:39,560
It just looks like it's made out of puff pastry or paper mache.

1254
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,239
But that's fine.

1255
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,199
I'm just playing around.

1256
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:49,989
All right, what's next?

1257
01:34:49,989 --> 01:34:56,869
This next part is, I kind of want to fix this.

1258
01:34:56,869 --> 01:35:01,479
And I want to change that to webcam demands.

1259
01:35:01,479 --> 01:35:04,039
I'm just, honestly, I'm just trying to focus.

1260
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:08,560
So I haven't really been looking at chat that much because

1261
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:11,779
I've been trying to focus on making trees.

1262
01:35:11,779 --> 01:35:13,300
And that's a pretty damn good tree.

1263
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,239
But no, I'm not going to put on a webcam.

1264
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:18,279
Why would I put a webcam on?

1265
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,800
No, you want to see the beauty of the mountains, not me.

1266
01:35:26,289 --> 01:35:27,970
All right, let's go into.

1267
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:36,560
Now, unfortunately, I made, I said I wanted this to be a sculpture.

1268
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,560
So I didn't say I wanted this to be a video game.

1269
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:41,680
Does anybody know if does that matter?

1270
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:47,399
Or can I make this a platformer starting like over here and make it over here?

1271
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:51,170
No, it doesn't matter.

1272
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:51,489
Okay.

1273
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:54,609
Well, let's do what I was going to do in the first place.

1274
01:35:54,609 --> 01:35:57,489
And let's just put these trees in different places.

1275
01:35:58,369 --> 01:36:13,439
And yes, they all look the same.

1276
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:14,800
But you know what?

1277
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:17,329
I don't got time.

1278
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:20,260
I don't got time to care about that.

1279
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:41,699
Because once you do this, it almost doesn't matter.

1280
01:36:41,699 --> 01:36:42,500
But I did.

1281
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,069
Nope.

1282
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:51,239
Nice grass.

1283
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:53,159
Yeah, I should probably put grass here first.

1284
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:57,090
And this isn't even big enough to have that tree here.

1285
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:00,390
Now it should be fine.

1286
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,350
Let's go like this.

1287
01:37:09,859 --> 01:37:12,279
That should do it.

1288
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,010
Now, what does that look like?

1289
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:19,729
That looks better.

1290
01:37:20,449 --> 01:37:29,479
This looks stupid.

1291
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,340
That doesn't look like it belongs anywhere over here.

1292
01:37:34,899 --> 01:37:39,079
Let's just go like that.

1293
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:44,760
And this needs to be changed.

1294
01:37:45,479 --> 01:37:48,310
I need to get in here.

1295
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:59,909
Because that's just sort of sticking out.

1296
01:38:00,869 --> 01:38:05,060
It looks bad.

1297
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:05,779
Make it bigger.

1298
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:13,159
Yeah.

1299
01:38:14,739 --> 01:38:15,460
Yeah.

1300
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:22,979
Oh, well, I can add a couple later anyways.

1301
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:24,739
Let's get some grass here.

1302
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,159
Back to the paint tool.

1303
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,260
And I would say what looks the most like grass.

1304
01:38:36,289 --> 01:38:39,720
That's not terrible.

1305
01:38:40,359 --> 01:38:51,699
Do you know you don't own a single thing in the game?

1306
01:38:51,699 --> 01:38:57,090
What do you mean?

1307
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:59,890
That's grassy.

1308
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,170
That's good grassy.

1309
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:04,850
Oh, yeah.

1310
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:05,170
Okay.

1311
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:05,970
Let's get some grass.

1312
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:07,409
What do you mean?

1313
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:08,130
You don't own it?

1314
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:14,000
Or is it one of those scenarios where a media molecule owns the rights?

1315
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,760
Well, I guess you have to sign that EULA, right?

1316
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:18,399
Or whatever it is.

1317
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:29,859
All right.

1318
01:39:29,859 --> 01:39:30,819
This is grass.

1319
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:40,000
I'm going to do a fun thing called copy this 5,000 times.

1320
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:48,279
They're going to start producing the popsicle.

1321
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,890
I just make somebody eating a popsicle next.

1322
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:56,210
God damn it.

1323
01:39:58,899 --> 01:39:59,220
Why?

1324
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:06,920
Well, whatever.

1325
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,600
Just going to do it like this anyways.

1326
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:18,819
I'm just going to paint it on there.

1327
01:40:18,819 --> 01:40:20,100
Why make an object?

1328
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,380
There's no reason to even do that.

1329
01:40:21,939 --> 01:40:24,500
I'm just going to paint it to the surface and call it a day.

1330
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,000
Brush is fine.

1331
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,760
Surface snap.

1332
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:34,800
Yeah.

1333
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,119
Fuck it.

1334
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,079
Let's just paint it on here.

1335
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,880
Give me the green.

1336
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:45,670
And it was, which one was it?

1337
01:40:45,670 --> 01:40:46,229
This one, right?

1338
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:50,390
Straight up, maybe?

1339
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:52,180
Yeah, that's fine.

1340
01:40:52,819 --> 01:41:02,659
That's fine.

1341
01:41:02,659 --> 01:41:08,180
Once we get it painted in here, we can mess with the fleck and it'll look like grass.

1342
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:16,479
Chat's bored.

1343
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:19,359
Well, I did tell you what I was going to be doing today.

1344
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:22,319
I did make it very clear that I was going to just be playing dreams

1345
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:24,079
and sculpting random stuff and learning.

1346
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,260
I did say that.

1347
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:31,000
You promised Sam and Max.

1348
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,239
On Friday.

1349
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:35,279
Today's not Friday.

1350
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:49,439
Check your calendar.

1351
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:50,880
Do the whole stream like that.

1352
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:58,760
You said you're playing other people's maps.

1353
01:41:58,760 --> 01:41:59,880
Well, here's the thing.

1354
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:03,319
Nobody made any.

1355
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:05,890
So that happened.

1356
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:11,880
There are no maps with the title German.

1357
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,520
Unless somebody made one and I don't know about it.

1358
01:42:17,619 --> 01:42:20,979
I've said for the last like week that I was going to be playing dreams today.

1359
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:36,710
And that's what we're doing because I like want to learn how to play it.

1360
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:41,079
Look, I can't make anything unless I learn how to play.

1361
01:42:41,079 --> 01:42:43,079
And I can't learn how to play unless I play.

1362
01:42:43,079 --> 01:42:47,479
And I can't not stream it because I stream three or four days a week.

1363
01:42:47,479 --> 01:42:49,489
So I have to play it.

1364
01:42:49,489 --> 01:42:51,250
Otherwise, I'm never going to make anything.

1365
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:58,310
All right, let's see how this looks.

1366
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:10,500
There's only like five new games since the first stream.

1367
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:13,399
Well, it is.

1368
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,750
Here's something I will say, right?

1369
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:24,550
This game asks a lot out of the player.

1370
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:28,630
It's very, very much a full video game engine.

1371
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:30,710
When you have like 10 hours of tutorials,

1372
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:41,239
you're expecting somebody's going to want to do it, right?

1373
01:43:41,239 --> 01:43:46,529
And this game has been sort of in development

1374
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:51,670
for a very, it's been sitting in development for like what, five, six years?

1375
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:58,449
Maybe they've been desperately trying to figure out how to make the game appealing to people

1376
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:02,449
without requiring them to play for like 150 hours to do anything.

1377
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,250
But you kind of have to do that.

1378
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:13,600
It's an amazing art tool, an amazing game and crafting tool.

1379
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:21,039
So it might be a hard sell for most people though,

1380
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:23,039
because I mean that doesn't surprise me

1381
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:25,880
because the game asks, it does ask a lot.

1382
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,979
The game's tutorials take as long as like Resident Evil 2 did to beat the whole game.

1383
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:32,500
At least one of the, you know, sides.

1384
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:37,250
All right, let me see how that looks.

1385
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:37,890
Wait, wait, wait.

1386
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:40,130
I don't want grass all the way over here.

1387
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:49,890
I'm going to do a little bit and have it fade out.

1388
01:44:50,449 --> 01:44:59,000
All right, let's see what that looks like.

1389
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,800
Because now we go like this.

1390
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:09,170
Okay, what's going on here?

1391
01:45:11,569 --> 01:45:12,529
What did I fuck up here?

1392
01:45:15,649 --> 01:45:18,720
I did, I screwed something up here and I don't know what.

1393
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:26,149
I just want to select this and make it look like grass.

1394
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:32,500
Oh god, this game would be amazing on PC.

1395
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,699
Yeah, it's kind of baffling actually

1396
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:38,899
that they would spend this much time making such a cool experience

1397
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:42,739
that you have to control with like the motion controllers or the DualShock.

1398
01:45:43,779 --> 01:45:48,819
If I had a mouse, this stuff would be going 500 times faster.

1399
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:52,579
And I think that's going to be a huge problem

1400
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:54,180
for a lot of people that want to get into this game

1401
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:58,819
is they'll just be like, well, why don't I just go play with Unity instead?

1402
01:45:58,819 --> 01:45:59,380
You know what I mean?

1403
01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:03,479
It's like way too much for like a casual audience to do

1404
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:08,310
and way too little for somebody that has Unity.

1405
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:17,300
It's weird because I'm not sure what audience they're targeting with this game.

1406
01:46:17,859 --> 01:46:24,039
But regardless, I need to find out why.

1407
01:46:25,569 --> 01:46:26,529
Why is this happening?

1408
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:32,869
There we go, volume brush.

1409
01:46:32,869 --> 01:46:33,270
There it was.

1410
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,829
All right, here we go.

1411
01:46:34,869 --> 01:46:42,119
Okay, come down.

1412
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:45,479
People who want Unity but don't want or don't have a PC or something.

1413
01:46:45,479 --> 01:47:00,630
Maybe I'm going to make this a little tinted a little bit.

1414
01:47:01,829 --> 01:47:03,560
Put on music.

1415
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:03,960
I will.

1416
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,079
I will.

1417
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:06,560
Just a minute.

1418
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:18,289
I'm not sure what the fuck this thing is even for.

1419
01:47:19,409 --> 01:47:21,189
It just kind of screws everything up.

1420
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:26,289
All right, let's do effects.

1421
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,340
And we need to do wave.

1422
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:39,409
That's a little too much.

1423
01:47:39,409 --> 01:47:40,210
That's like water.

1424
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,600
Flow maybe.

1425
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:50,810
Hmm.

1426
01:47:51,829 --> 01:47:59,060
But yeah, to give you like, I guess, I've put the stream for like an hour in like 50 minutes or so.

1427
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:00,899
And the tutorials.

1428
01:48:00,899 --> 01:48:03,619
I put probably 15 hours in the game so far.

1429
01:48:03,619 --> 01:48:05,859
20 if we count, right?

1430
01:48:05,859 --> 01:48:08,260
Like 15 to 20 if you count the first stream.

1431
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:15,569
Are you making a poison swamp?

1432
01:48:15,569 --> 01:48:16,529
What is throb?

1433
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:17,810
Evaporate.

1434
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:19,649
Boil.

1435
01:48:21,329 --> 01:48:24,289
I really think it just needs to be like wave but just a tiny bit.

1436
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:25,729
That's all right.

1437
01:48:25,729 --> 01:48:26,289
It looks fine.

1438
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:36,739
But yeah, I do foresee a very, very difficult time when this releases.

1439
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:45,920
Because like I said, it's almost too complicated for anyone to play it casually,

1440
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,119
but not complicated enough for somebody that's serious about it.

1441
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:54,609
Let's change this.

1442
01:48:55,250 --> 01:49:03,800
Is that tight?

1443
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:04,279
It is.

1444
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:12,289
Okay, let's see.

1445
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:15,539
Uh-huh.

1446
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:20,390
Oh no, not again.

1447
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:21,270
What happened?

1448
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:29,640
All right, let me.

1449
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:34,640
All right, now let's take this back here.

1450
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:40,369
And I need this look bad.

1451
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:42,279
All right, let's get it.

1452
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:43,800
Wait, I can move a tree now over here.

1453
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:49,170
We've got a good group of green hues.

1454
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:54,979
What's the end game here?

1455
01:49:54,979 --> 01:49:55,939
I really don't have one.

1456
01:49:55,939 --> 01:49:57,140
I'm just trying to like,

1457
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:58,979
I'm just trying to make sure I know how to use the tools.

1458
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:05,520
And then I'm going to make like the ice cream or something.

1459
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,050
I'm going to try to sculpt like a face, but just kind of dicking around.

1460
01:50:10,609 --> 01:50:14,630
Let me add some more color here.

1461
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:21,279
Same thing.

1462
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:22,239
We'll do more of this.

1463
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:26,050
Have I tried the move controllers?

1464
01:50:26,369 --> 01:50:28,529
I have not used the move controllers for one reason,

1465
01:50:28,529 --> 01:50:29,409
because you need the camera.

1466
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:32,130
And I don't have the PS move,

1467
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,289
PS4 camera anymore,

1468
01:50:34,289 --> 01:50:36,609
because I gave the PS VR to a friend.

1469
01:50:37,649 --> 01:50:38,689
So I don't have it anymore.

1470
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:41,890
So I have the move controllers, not the camera.

1471
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:46,119
But I got to pee.

1472
01:50:46,119 --> 01:50:46,680
I'll be right back.

1473
01:50:49,029 --> 01:50:50,710
And then we'll make like a person.

1474
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,149
We'll make like a character.

1475
01:50:52,149 --> 01:52:46,399
I'll be right back.

1476
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:49,720
All right, I think I have an idea.

1477
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:53,760
I've got an idea.

1478
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:05,319
Once I get the scene done, I'm going to make the giant that lives here.

1479
01:53:11,859 --> 01:53:13,300
Play something else now.

1480
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:16,640
How am I ever going to learn?

1481
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:19,510
You know what I mean?

1482
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,310
Like how am I ever going to know how to do anything?

1483
01:53:22,869 --> 01:53:25,140
That's been an hour.

1484
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,100
See you later.

1485
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,380
I'm going to play a different game.

1486
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,819
I'll come back and do it again.

1487
01:53:28,819 --> 01:53:30,899
When I, yeah, impossible, by the way.

1488
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:38,479
Just learn unity instead.

1489
01:53:47,649 --> 01:53:48,850
Imagine learning.

1490
01:53:48,850 --> 01:53:50,689
I know, imagine learning anything.

1491
01:53:53,539 --> 01:53:55,300
No, no learning.

1492
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,579
Only results.

1493
01:53:57,380 --> 01:53:58,739
No preparation.

1494
01:53:58,739 --> 01:53:59,619
No learning.

1495
01:53:59,619 --> 01:54:01,140
Only results.

1496
01:54:01,140 --> 01:54:11,460
Imagine actually learning.

1497
01:54:11,460 --> 01:54:11,960
All right.

1498
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:14,819
What else do we have for songs?

1499
01:54:14,819 --> 01:54:27,619
I should make water down there too.

1500
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:38,500
Yeah, I can't tell you this is going to be the most interesting stream,

1501
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,779
but I want to play it.

1502
01:54:41,489 --> 01:54:42,930
I want to learn how to do something.

1503
01:54:42,930 --> 01:54:43,810
So at least I look.

1504
01:54:44,689 --> 01:54:47,010
I was looking forward to this game for a long time, right?

1505
01:54:47,010 --> 01:54:48,050
And we're also going to make it rain.

1506
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:49,489
They're going to make it.

1507
01:54:49,489 --> 01:54:50,369
Yeah, we're going to make it rain.

1508
01:54:57,569 --> 01:55:00,529
I'm going to take my time and I'm going to just try to make something interesting.

1509
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:02,930
Look, what you see here, it's the culmination.

1510
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,930
It's going to be in like another hour or two.

1511
01:55:05,729 --> 01:55:07,489
There's going to be like a whole village over here.

1512
01:55:07,489 --> 01:55:09,010
There's going to be like something going on over here.

1513
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,489
I'm just going to make like a big living sculpture.

1514
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,750
The only way you can learn is if you do it.

1515
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:19,939
That's the only way.

1516
01:55:19,939 --> 01:55:23,520
And it's going to take a little while and that's all right.

1517
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:27,989
I'm going to move this out of the way.

1518
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:34,390
You can also study to learn when.

1519
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,000
When would you like me to do that?

1520
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:39,060
I'm going to take two weeks off.

1521
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:43,220
I'm going to not stream for two weeks and come back with like two things

1522
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:44,100
that I made in dreams.

1523
01:55:44,819 --> 01:55:46,689
Is that what you want me to do?

1524
01:55:47,329 --> 01:55:49,890
You sure?

1525
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:00,159
You were supposed to do that.

1526
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:04,239
I was supposed to take two weeks off of streaming to learn how to play Dreams?

1527
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:07,319
What are you talking about?

1528
01:56:08,199 --> 01:56:18,079
What do you mean I did that?

1529
01:56:20,449 --> 01:56:23,329
I said I wanted to do the tutorials, which are 10 hours.

1530
01:56:31,079 --> 01:56:31,960
And I already did it.

1531
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:39,590
We're talking about when I was with my mother.

1532
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:41,109
Oh, hey, Ma.

1533
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:41,829
Nah, nah, nah, sorry.

1534
01:56:41,829 --> 01:56:43,270
We're not what you wait.

1535
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:44,550
I haven't seen you in like eight months.

1536
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,359
Yeah, no, no, no.

1537
01:56:46,359 --> 01:56:47,720
Just just just just go.

1538
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:48,920
I'm not going to do anything with you.

1539
01:56:49,649 --> 01:56:54,069
I'm playing Dreams every day for like six to 10 hours a day.

1540
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:56,710
No, just go home.

1541
01:56:59,270 --> 01:56:59,989
I'm studying.

1542
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:19,109
No tutorial is going to give you creativity.

1543
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,430
Yeah.

1544
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:21,590
Like, so what do you think I'm doing right now?

1545
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:37,350
Let's get a song.

1546
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,640
Did somebody make this?

1547
01:57:58,630 --> 01:58:00,680
Final Fantasy Overworld thing.

1548
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,600
Bubble tea.

1549
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:08,880
I feel like I want to mix a music.

1550
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,560
I want to make a song too.

1551
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,680
After I'm done with this, I want to make

1552
01:58:26,069 --> 01:58:28,149
I was just like, I want to play list in the background.

1553
01:58:28,149 --> 01:58:29,670
I thought my PlayStation just turned off.

1554
01:58:30,789 --> 01:58:32,399
I was like, what the fuck just happened?

1555
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:39,890
Let's get the playlist.

1556
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:42,289
Actually, I can't hear it because the PlayStation 4.

1557
01:58:44,949 --> 01:58:51,569
But on the moon theme, I feel like that'll get old in a few minutes.

1558
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,439
Evil Morty.

1559
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:07,479
Wait, is this an entire playlist?

1560
01:59:08,199 --> 01:59:08,840
Whoa, okay.

1561
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:14,609
City folk?

1562
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:22,880
Not again.

1563
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:25,520
Oh, near automata.

1564
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:27,439
Alien manifestation?

1565
01:59:45,079 --> 01:59:52,100
I feel like this is kind of soy milk.

1566
01:59:54,689 --> 01:59:55,649
Added vocals.

1567
01:59:58,130 --> 01:59:58,369
Okay.

1568
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,630
Let's see what you got.

1569
02:00:09,329 --> 02:00:11,270
Added vocals.

1570
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:14,229
It's just instrument.

1571
02:00:14,229 --> 02:00:15,909
There's no added vocals.

1572
02:00:15,909 --> 02:00:18,869
Let's go here.

1573
02:00:18,869 --> 02:00:28,600
Take the giant.

1574
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:11,909
This is fucking terrifying.

1575
02:01:14,359 --> 02:01:14,840
Mama.

1576
02:02:05,939 --> 02:02:07,699
Devil in his head.

1577
02:02:45,909 --> 02:02:47,750
This is so scary.

1578
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:49,989
It really is with this song in the background.

1579
02:02:50,789 --> 02:03:23,829
Oh, that's way too big of an ear.

1580
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,600
It looks like somebody is punching through his head.

1581
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,560
Through his brain.

1582
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:40,609
That's what it is.

1583
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:25,810
I don't think I can put blood everywhere, can I?

1584
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:49,430
It's got to be way, way thinner.

1585
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:56,930
He's doing a thumbs up.

1586
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,439
That's not a thumb.

1587
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:28,500
It's not a thumb.

1588
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,699
I gotta get in front of him.

1589
02:05:29,699 --> 02:05:30,260
Look at this.

1590
02:05:31,060 --> 02:05:34,079
Look at that, like cooked, cut up cauliflower.

1591
02:05:35,909 --> 02:05:36,470
I can do it.

1592
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,869
Hold on.

1593
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:58,229
I can't.

1594
02:06:03,539 --> 02:06:05,380
No, I like it like that.

1595
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,340
That's your thumb.

1596
02:06:06,340 --> 02:06:08,100
Your thumb bends all the way backwards.

1597
02:06:09,649 --> 02:06:12,289
Like a fucking deflated balloon.

1598
02:06:12,289 --> 02:06:14,289
It's not even pointing the right way.

1599
02:06:16,609 --> 02:06:29,239
All right, so that's his end of his hand.

1600
02:06:29,239 --> 02:06:29,800
I'll fix it.

1601
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:41,159
He's sounding like a clown.

1602
02:06:42,680 --> 02:06:52,069
All right, that's his arm.

1603
02:06:53,909 --> 02:06:58,479
So that's the end of his arm moving up into here.

1604
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:01,119
Into his like, bicep.

1605
02:07:04,039 --> 02:07:05,239
Oh my god, this is...

1606
02:07:05,239 --> 02:07:06,279
What the fuck have I done?

1607
02:07:09,569 --> 02:07:11,250
I gotta keep track of who is who.

1608
02:07:12,050 --> 02:07:14,760
Because this is bicep into shoulder.

1609
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:22,880
Okay, so this guy didn't even see him coming.

1610
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:28,659
By the way, it doesn't...

1611
02:07:28,659 --> 02:07:30,420
This doesn't matter because I just needed to...

1612
02:07:30,420 --> 02:07:32,819
I just needed to look over the edge.

1613
02:07:38,949 --> 02:07:40,710
It just needs to be up...

1614
02:07:40,710 --> 02:07:44,229
When we take the picture, it just needs to be above there.

1615
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:55,319
All right, so arm and we're gonna have shoulder.

1616
02:07:55,319 --> 02:07:55,640
What does he...

1617
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,359
What does it look like?

1618
02:07:57,079 --> 02:07:58,359
What's like a body look like?

1619
02:07:58,359 --> 02:07:59,319
I don't even fucking know.

1620
02:08:00,119 --> 02:08:01,239
The big cylinder here.

1621
02:08:02,710 --> 02:08:03,590
Tilt it a little bit.

1622
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:17,989
Okay, so that's like chest.

1623
02:08:18,949 --> 02:08:21,460
I can carve it a little more.

1624
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:21,859
Hold on.

1625
02:08:22,579 --> 02:08:31,319
Okay, let's go down here.

1626
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,680
They don't need to see the rest of the body.

1627
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,279
And by they, I mean you.

1628
02:08:52,279 --> 02:08:53,640
And by you, I mean me.

1629
02:08:54,199 --> 02:08:55,960
And by people, I mean anyone.

1630
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:00,739
No, you don't have to see the whole thing.

1631
02:09:00,739 --> 02:09:05,810
Because look, I'm gonna move him over here.

1632
02:09:06,529 --> 02:09:09,000
He's got somebody's head as a wristband.

1633
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:15,640
All right, let me just...

1634
02:09:16,439 --> 02:09:17,640
Let me move them over here.

1635
02:09:18,199 --> 02:09:34,390
Maybe I need...

1636
02:09:34,390 --> 02:09:37,329
Okay, I might need a little bit of legs.

1637
02:09:45,329 --> 02:10:02,369
That gonna be up a little bit higher this way.

1638
02:10:03,329 --> 02:10:05,890
That's better.

1639
02:10:11,729 --> 02:10:20,260
I love how this shit is moving, but he's not.

1640
02:10:20,979 --> 02:10:25,279
So the head doesn't matter because we don't need a head on him.

1641
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:26,850
He needs a body.

1642
02:10:27,409 --> 02:10:31,000
I need to take like a good screenshot too.

1643
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:36,180
All right, we need a body on him.

1644
02:10:38,789 --> 02:10:39,510
The hair too.

1645
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:43,279
All right, get back in here.

1646
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:58,289
It's a long ass neck.

1647
02:10:58,289 --> 02:11:07,380
No, no, no, no, no.

1648
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:11,199
Come down and we'll go like this.

1649
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:29,640
No, that's not his leg.

1650
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,720
That's his collarbone.

1651
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:37,380
What is the point of this?

1652
02:11:38,020 --> 02:11:41,460
To just use the program and learn how to use it.

1653
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:45,939
And be comfortable using it is pretty much the point.

1654
02:11:51,329 --> 02:11:52,930
He's got like a ruffled shirt on.

1655
02:11:52,930 --> 02:11:59,859
And then this has to be a little bigger.

1656
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:09,220
And arms will come out of here.

1657
02:12:09,939 --> 02:12:14,789
We got a paint job to do too.

1658
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:25,159
He's made out of party cups.

1659
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:39,640
He's made out of paper cups.

1660
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:41,640
Who cares?

1661
02:12:42,199 --> 02:12:51,409
He just wanted to be a real boy.

1662
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:53,890
All right, all right, all right.

1663
02:12:53,890 --> 02:13:01,829
See from here it doesn't even matter.

1664
02:13:01,829 --> 02:13:06,289
I was making a nice scene too.

1665
02:13:06,289 --> 02:13:09,729
And everyone got like mad because I wasn't doing anything.

1666
02:13:10,289 --> 02:13:15,119
So then I came over and made paper cup monster get punched through his head.

1667
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:16,319
Are you happy now?

1668
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:29,680
Are you happy that I made this now?

1669
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:31,359
Now we're angrier than before.

1670
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:32,479
All right, let me paint this.

1671
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:39,359
I need paint.

1672
02:13:44,119 --> 02:13:45,560
Spray can, where is it?

1673
02:13:45,560 --> 02:13:48,949
What about the other guy's head?

1674
02:13:48,949 --> 02:13:51,189
Well, hold on, I need to get this done first.

1675
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:56,609
These are like paper cups, right?

1676
02:14:03,909 --> 02:14:05,670
It's like fucking solo cups.

1677
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:07,829
Snap to surface, let's paint.

1678
02:14:09,029 --> 02:14:16,720
Can that face be a new emote?

1679
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:19,189
No, we can only get one new emote.

1680
02:14:19,829 --> 02:14:23,760
We'll get the circle that's easiest to paint with.

1681
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:28,960
And spray can and red.

1682
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:32,069
It's not that dark.

1683
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:33,829
I guess maybe it is.

1684
02:14:53,649 --> 02:14:56,739
That's a great color.

1685
02:14:56,739 --> 02:14:58,100
Red party cups.

1686
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:06,119
Proceed to party.

1687
02:15:28,930 --> 02:15:30,609
Careful I don't go all the way up.

1688
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:54,359
Okay, now this is no longer I don't think party cups anymore.

1689
02:15:55,159 --> 02:15:57,520
I think this is just the guy's like spine.

1690
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:02,260
I'm gonna make them plastic though.

1691
02:16:02,260 --> 02:16:04,800
So hold your horses.

1692
02:16:14,630 --> 02:16:16,069
Tighten this up just a little bit.

1693
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:34,760
Okay, I also I have to make this a different group.

1694
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:40,420
Uh-oh, because if I change the coat on this,

1695
02:16:41,379 --> 02:16:44,600
it's not going to look right for the rest of the person.

1696
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:53,040
So get me out of here.

1697
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:07,200
This, okay.

1698
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,590
So this is, uh-oh, I didn't think this through.

1699
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:14,870
I just kind of was making it because this needs to be a completely separate thing

1700
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:17,030
from the group so I can change this without changing that.

1701
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:28,610
Yeah, see, I was supposed to start a new,

1702
02:17:28,610 --> 02:17:30,209
I should have started a new sculpture down here.

1703
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:34,549
I could just erase the neck.

1704
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:38,420
But it's still part of the same sculpture though.

1705
02:17:38,979 --> 02:17:40,850
Yeah, I can't break it up.

1706
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:47,139
Shit.

1707
02:17:53,959 --> 02:17:57,190
Wait, can I cut out?

1708
02:18:00,579 --> 02:18:05,700
Um, I'm not sure what it means by cut out.

1709
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,780
Like cut out the, hold on.

1710
02:18:08,579 --> 02:18:14,000
Will it just take this whole thing?

1711
02:18:14,639 --> 02:18:20,870
Make sure I can see the whole thing.

1712
02:18:37,719 --> 02:18:38,440
Let's see what happens.

1713
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,440
Uh, did I get it?

1714
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:49,399
Makes it a separate sculpture.

1715
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:51,639
I don't think I really got it.

1716
02:18:53,030 --> 02:18:54,469
Um, give me the shape.

1717
02:18:54,469 --> 02:18:55,510
Let me just get the square.

1718
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:18,819
All right, how, are they all in?

1719
02:19:18,819 --> 02:19:23,600
I think they're all in, right?

1720
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:31,010
Not quite.

1721
02:19:31,010 --> 02:19:34,370
Oh my god, it's so hard to control this and get it in the right spot.

1722
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:36,370
I wish I could just have the camera stay put.

1723
02:19:36,370 --> 02:19:38,209
Like actually stay in one spot.

1724
02:19:38,209 --> 02:19:41,430
I don't want the camera to follow me around everywhere.

1725
02:19:41,430 --> 02:19:44,469
I wish I could just keep the camera just like up here.

1726
02:19:44,469 --> 02:19:45,190
Just keep it there.

1727
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:47,520
I don't think you can.

1728
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:50,790
Because every time I move, it moves the camera forward.

1729
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:57,120
Did I get it?

1730
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,559
I kind of got it.

1731
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:04,600
I missed the bottom.

1732
02:20:05,319 --> 02:20:08,959
That's good enough.

1733
02:20:12,209 --> 02:20:14,290
So now, what do I do with that now?

1734
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:15,090
Just, that's it?

1735
02:20:15,090 --> 02:20:16,370
It's just its own sculpture.

1736
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:20,739
Okay, cool.

1737
02:20:21,379 --> 02:20:26,870
All right, so let's give it a finish.

1738
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:31,110
Shiny, where's plastic?

1739
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:31,610
Plastic.

1740
02:20:32,229 --> 02:20:37,700
It's already there.

1741
02:20:37,700 --> 02:20:38,739
I need something better than that.

1742
02:20:38,739 --> 02:20:39,239
Shiny.

1743
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:44,950
I'm not really seeing a difference at all.

1744
02:20:48,229 --> 02:20:49,030
Shiny metal.

1745
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:57,719
Hmm, shiny wax.

1746
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:01,319
Shiny, plastic, rough, metal.

1747
02:21:01,959 --> 02:21:09,569
Back to here, shiny.

1748
02:21:09,569 --> 02:21:14,639
I don't really see a difference.

1749
02:21:14,639 --> 02:21:15,520
I mean, I guess a little.

1750
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:20,639
I guess it is shiny, huh?

1751
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:29,159
A little shiny wax.

1752
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:32,159
No, that just makes it look weird.

1753
02:21:45,729 --> 02:21:47,489
Well, I mean, it's on there.

1754
02:21:47,489 --> 02:21:51,010
Change the lighting.

1755
02:21:51,010 --> 02:21:57,920
Isn't there a way to turn on like studio lighting or something?

1756
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:16,159
The guides.

1757
02:22:17,459 --> 02:22:17,959
There it is.

1758
02:22:19,489 --> 02:22:20,450
Studio lighting.

1759
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,159
That's one thing.

1760
02:22:27,159 --> 02:22:29,479
I don't think there was a tutorial for lighting.

1761
02:22:29,479 --> 02:22:45,350
Let me just paint the rest of this.

1762
02:22:45,350 --> 02:23:00,520
So this is going to be, we'll just go with a orange, something blue.

1763
02:23:01,079 --> 02:23:03,319
Big like frost demon, frost giant.

1764
02:23:03,319 --> 02:23:05,989
That's what it's going to be.

1765
02:23:05,989 --> 02:23:31,840
Shit, his head is also a part of this.

1766
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,799
Well, that didn't really turn out exactly what I was looking for.

1767
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:07,889
Well, okay.

1768
02:24:09,219 --> 02:24:12,020
Close the context menu.

1769
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:12,739
What happens if I...

1770
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:37,969
That's like all fucked up.

1771
02:24:39,909 --> 02:24:41,649
I need...

1772
02:24:41,649 --> 02:24:42,129
Here.

1773
02:24:42,129 --> 02:24:43,250
Here's the problem.

1774
02:24:43,250 --> 02:24:45,479
I know what the problem is.

1775
02:24:45,479 --> 02:25:16,680
Oops.

1776
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:44,979
You don't know what you're looking at?

1777
02:25:44,979 --> 02:25:45,459
Neither do I.

1778
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:53,139
All I know is I need more grass.

1779
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:30,079
Okay.

1780
02:26:30,079 --> 02:26:31,920
I need more like snow and shit too.

1781
02:26:32,719 --> 02:26:40,690
Because it's got to be much more pronounced than it is.

1782
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:50,120
These tops need to be changed.

1783
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:03,889
That's what I'm talking about.

1784
02:27:04,610 --> 02:27:06,819
Should have been like this since the very beginning.

1785
02:27:07,620 --> 02:27:12,739
Not individual pieces.

1786
02:27:25,829 --> 02:27:26,329
Closer.

1787
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:29,680
They look like clouds.

1788
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,180
Yeah.

1789
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:33,280
I think they're just kind of wind.

1790
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:34,399
I'm going to paint snow on.

1791
02:27:34,959 --> 02:27:37,040
That's a finishing touch though.

1792
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:38,159
We're not closing it.

1793
02:27:38,719 --> 02:27:41,879
We're going to do the same thing over here.

1794
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:47,840
I need to like add texture to this shit too.

1795
02:27:52,579 --> 02:27:53,540
Because it looks like...

1796
02:27:53,540 --> 02:27:54,500
It looks like shit.

1797
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:55,620
Those mountains look like shit.

1798
02:27:56,979 --> 02:27:57,459
You can say it.

1799
02:27:57,459 --> 02:27:58,420
You're not going to hurt my feelings.

1800
02:27:58,420 --> 02:27:59,540
They look like dog shit.

1801
02:28:00,899 --> 02:28:01,299
Say it.

1802
02:28:02,450 --> 02:28:03,409
Don't worry.

1803
02:28:03,409 --> 02:28:04,049
I can handle it.

1804
02:28:37,159 --> 02:29:11,409
Trees moving, right?

1805
02:29:12,129 --> 02:29:13,409
That's a good tree.

1806
02:29:13,409 --> 02:29:13,909
Hold on.

1807
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:48,479
These are more color.

1808
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:54,239
I'm not sure I like this.

1809
02:29:58,790 --> 02:29:59,670
You know what I mean?

1810
02:29:59,670 --> 02:30:00,549
I don't think I like it.

1811
02:30:02,719 --> 02:30:04,200
I don't think it adds anything.

1812
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:09,000
Nah.

1813
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,559
I don't like it.

1814
02:30:11,010 --> 02:30:11,489
All right.

1815
02:30:11,489 --> 02:30:13,329
Now we're going to do a little bit of work down here.

1816
02:30:13,329 --> 02:30:14,530
Because it needs to be some more rocks.

1817
02:30:14,530 --> 02:30:15,250
This is too plain.

1818
02:30:15,250 --> 02:30:16,530
Looks like a textured...

1819
02:30:17,170 --> 02:30:17,409
No.

1820
02:30:17,409 --> 02:30:18,690
This is going to be more detail.

1821
02:30:19,569 --> 02:30:22,770
They call me Jeremy Mr. Detail Elbertson.

1822
02:30:31,940 --> 02:30:32,579
No they don't.

1823
02:30:32,579 --> 02:30:33,139
Yes they do.

1824
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:35,079
Yes they do.

1825
02:30:35,079 --> 02:30:39,270
Okay.

1826
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,270
Let's get some snow up here.

1827
02:30:43,909 --> 02:30:46,079
I'm going to start with the snow.

1828
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:48,979
I think a splat would look good.

1829
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:51,270
Splat with...

1830
02:30:53,879 --> 02:30:59,889
Let's see.

1831
02:30:59,889 --> 02:31:05,879
Make it nice and white here.

1832
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:27,250
I don't need the kaleidoscope.

1833
02:31:32,450 --> 02:31:33,250
Unnecessary.

1834
02:31:33,809 --> 02:31:34,370
Don't need it.

1835
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:06,399
Is it...

1836
02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:06,879
What is it on?

1837
02:32:06,879 --> 02:32:07,280
Stamp.

1838
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:11,159
Brush.

1839
02:32:11,799 --> 02:32:14,239
Brush is fine.

1840
02:32:14,239 --> 02:32:22,229
Paint.

1841
02:32:22,229 --> 02:32:22,870
Same deal.

1842
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:23,430
No, no, no, no.

1843
02:32:23,430 --> 02:32:24,469
What are you doing?

1844
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:25,829
What the hell are you doing?

1845
02:32:25,829 --> 02:32:27,399
It's flat.

1846
02:32:29,989 --> 02:32:30,549
Right there.

1847
02:32:30,549 --> 02:32:30,790
Okay.

1848
02:32:31,510 --> 02:32:35,280
Why is it blue?

1849
02:32:40,930 --> 02:32:41,889
Shiny.

1850
02:32:41,889 --> 02:32:42,450
Default.

1851
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:44,840
Rough.

1852
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:48,149
I want it to be this color.

1853
02:32:48,709 --> 02:32:49,590
Why is it blue?

1854
02:32:50,149 --> 02:32:55,540
Am I missing something here?

1855
02:32:56,100 --> 02:33:14,450
Can I like...

1856
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:17,809
No, it's a different sculpture now.

1857
02:33:17,809 --> 02:33:18,450
What the fuck?

1858
02:33:19,409 --> 02:33:21,969
It actually doesn't look bad.

1859
02:33:31,250 --> 02:33:32,209
Sprink it a little bit.

1860
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:47,059
More clouds.

1861
02:33:47,059 --> 02:33:47,459
Hold on.

1862
02:33:47,459 --> 02:33:47,860
Hold on.

1863
02:33:47,860 --> 02:33:48,260
Hold on.

1864
02:33:48,260 --> 02:33:48,659
Hold on.

1865
02:33:49,379 --> 02:33:49,860
Not yet.

1866
02:33:50,659 --> 02:33:58,389
I need to go this.

1867
02:33:59,670 --> 02:34:01,270
The top should be snow covered, right?

1868
02:34:02,229 --> 02:34:08,159
Um.

1869
02:34:08,159 --> 02:34:12,659
What the fuck happened there?

1870
02:34:13,299 --> 02:34:33,360
No, let's get this on snap.

1871
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:38,819
It's kind of hard to fucking even see what you're doing.

1872
02:34:38,819 --> 02:34:55,010
He's doing Yoshi's Island?

1873
02:34:55,010 --> 02:34:55,809
Yeah.

1874
02:34:55,809 --> 02:34:57,010
Yeah, you get it.

1875
02:34:57,010 --> 02:35:18,610
Like snow, though.

1876
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:19,729
I guess it kind of does.

1877
02:35:19,729 --> 02:35:21,170
The clouds sort of ruin it.

1878
02:35:36,739 --> 02:35:38,579
This needs to be a different color.

1879
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:42,840
It needs to be like blue or light blue.

1880
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:46,280
It does have to be blue because the more this has to be lighter.

1881
02:35:46,280 --> 02:35:51,520
All right.

1882
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:51,920
Back in.

1883
02:35:52,559 --> 02:36:01,319
Make the snow glossy.

1884
02:36:01,319 --> 02:36:02,200
Yeah, I could do that too.

1885
02:36:03,159 --> 02:36:07,879
Fuck.

1886
02:36:08,440 --> 02:36:19,379
Oh, I like this.

1887
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:31,190
Don't you want to just lick this mountain?

1888
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:32,549
I do.

1889
02:36:32,549 --> 02:36:44,399
I think I could make it a little bit bigger.

1890
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:49,879
Maybe not.

1891
02:36:49,879 --> 02:36:51,559
It's getting caught on itself.

1892
02:36:51,559 --> 02:36:56,739
And then I also have to do some more detail to the mountains themselves.

1893
02:36:56,739 --> 02:37:11,700
Oh, it's the shadow.

1894
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:12,340
I get it.

1895
02:37:12,340 --> 02:37:12,659
Okay.

1896
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:23,729
I was going to say, why is it changing color?

1897
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:31,670
Oh, God.

1898
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:32,389
I'm going to throw up.

1899
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:42,520
Oh, honey.

1900
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:43,639
Now I'm going to do the tip last.

1901
02:37:46,180 --> 02:37:49,780
Do you think I can copy this and put it over on the other sculptures?

1902
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:56,309
I mean, that's cheating.

1903
02:37:58,760 --> 02:37:59,799
But it's okay.

1904
02:37:59,799 --> 02:38:08,520
You don't think I could cheat this?

1905
02:38:08,520 --> 02:38:17,760
All right.

1906
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:20,870
Let's get up here and get the peak.

1907
02:38:20,870 --> 02:38:22,149
And I got to make it snow.

1908
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:40,680
Yes.

1909
02:38:47,170 --> 02:38:49,409
It's a little grassy looking, but it's all right.

1910
02:38:49,409 --> 02:38:59,280
I'm going to fluff it up a little bit.

1911
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:10,040
Oops.

1912
02:39:10,840 --> 02:39:14,950
We need the styles.

1913
02:39:15,909 --> 02:39:16,469
Looseness.

1914
02:39:16,469 --> 02:39:16,709
All right.

1915
02:39:16,709 --> 02:39:17,590
Here we go.

1916
02:39:17,590 --> 02:39:37,079
Might be a little too loose.

1917
02:39:37,079 --> 02:39:53,569
That's all right.

1918
02:39:54,290 --> 02:39:56,239
That doesn't look terrible.

1919
02:40:06,979 --> 02:40:07,620
Ruffle them up.

1920
02:40:08,659 --> 02:40:10,639
Now I'll pull it back.

1921
02:40:10,639 --> 02:40:14,440
I think that looks fine.

1922
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:18,079
This is a little heavy over here, though.

1923
02:40:18,079 --> 02:40:25,829
I think I need to move this a little or shave a little bit off

1924
02:40:25,829 --> 02:40:28,389
because it's a little heavy handed over here.

1925
02:40:29,270 --> 02:40:30,389
Just a little.

1926
02:40:30,389 --> 02:40:43,600
This little part kicking up right here.

1927
02:40:49,860 --> 02:40:50,979
Right there.

1928
02:40:54,309 --> 02:41:11,170
I can't get this one.

1929
02:41:14,180 --> 02:41:14,579
There it is.

1930
02:41:16,739 --> 02:41:17,459
All right.

1931
02:41:17,459 --> 02:41:18,180
I think that's good.

1932
02:41:24,069 --> 02:41:25,430
Now should I drop it?

1933
02:41:25,430 --> 02:41:26,790
Should I make these bigger and drop them?

1934
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:49,989
I don't think I even need these ones.

1935
02:41:49,989 --> 02:42:01,010
I need to add a little bit over here.

1936
02:42:01,010 --> 02:42:11,319
A little too intense, I think.

1937
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:36,079
Drop it even lower.

1938
02:42:43,329 --> 02:42:44,770
I think I'm getting rid of this one.

1939
02:42:44,770 --> 02:42:46,959
Let me see what it looks like.

1940
02:42:46,959 --> 02:42:48,239
Yeah.

1941
02:42:48,239 --> 02:42:48,559
Yeah.

1942
02:42:48,559 --> 02:42:49,280
I mean, like, yeah.

1943
02:42:50,319 --> 02:42:50,799
See you later.

1944
02:42:50,799 --> 02:42:51,600
That's gone.

1945
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:52,319
Wait a minute.

1946
02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:55,059
I think I'm just going to shave it.

1947
02:42:55,059 --> 02:42:56,260
I need more, like, over here.

1948
02:42:57,059 --> 02:43:00,520
I need to add lore.

1949
02:43:01,879 --> 02:43:02,760
Not yet.

1950
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:03,799
I can't do that yet.

1951
02:43:06,579 --> 02:43:09,459
My housemates are going to think I'm fucking insane

1952
02:43:09,459 --> 02:43:12,260
if they hear three seconds of that song again.

1953
02:43:12,899 --> 02:43:25,920
And you just keep replaying a midi version of Bohemian Rhapsody.

1954
02:43:27,559 --> 02:43:29,159
No, they're not going to think you're insane.

1955
02:43:29,159 --> 02:43:32,280
They're going to think you're learning how to play that song on the piano.

1956
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,479
And you keep starting over, over and over again

1957
02:43:35,479 --> 02:43:38,389
to learn the first 10 to 20 notes.

1958
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:43,479
Jeremy's going through a rough patch?

1959
02:43:43,479 --> 02:43:44,360
What are you talking about?

1960
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:48,020
Hey, get off my case, okay?

1961
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,940
I'm trying to learn how to play Dreams.

1962
02:43:49,940 --> 02:44:03,250
I might just turn this into, like, a fucking super expressionist

1963
02:44:03,250 --> 02:44:04,690
broad painting here.

1964
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:08,260
That means I can move this out.

1965
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:13,860
Make these a little bit.

1966
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:15,639
No, no, no.

1967
02:44:15,639 --> 02:44:19,239
No, no, no, no.

1968
02:44:19,239 --> 02:44:19,719
Look at this.

1969
02:44:19,719 --> 02:44:21,079
Look how fucking huge this is.

1970
02:44:21,079 --> 02:44:21,319
All right.

1971
02:44:21,319 --> 02:44:22,520
The trees are too big.

1972
02:44:22,520 --> 02:44:23,399
I figured out the problem.

1973
02:44:24,040 --> 02:44:28,579
The trees are too big.

1974
02:44:28,579 --> 02:44:29,540
Now it looks different.

1975
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:30,020
Looks better.

1976
02:44:38,639 --> 02:44:39,920
Now we got skill.

1977
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:41,120
That didn't look good.

1978
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:44,930
What happened here?

1979
02:44:44,930 --> 02:44:47,479
It's all right.

1980
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:49,399
We're not taking the picture from that side anyways.

1981
02:44:49,399 --> 02:45:01,840
I'm taking the picture from...

1982
02:45:02,879 --> 02:45:05,600
I don't know.

1983
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:08,899
This is a three-hour long bit.

1984
02:45:09,940 --> 02:45:11,780
No, there is no joke here.

1985
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:15,729
Look, not everything has to be a joke, okay?

1986
02:45:15,729 --> 02:45:20,549
You know, and in fact, no.

1987
02:45:20,549 --> 02:45:22,549
We're just doing a mountain scene.

1988
02:45:22,549 --> 02:45:42,229
How does it...

1989
02:45:42,229 --> 02:45:42,629
Okay.

1990
02:45:43,270 --> 02:45:43,750
I know.

1991
02:45:43,750 --> 02:45:45,590
Your roommates are gonna fucking kill you.

1992
02:45:45,590 --> 02:45:45,989
I know.

1993
02:45:45,989 --> 02:45:46,469
Okay.

1994
02:45:46,469 --> 02:45:52,420
I took care of it.

1995
02:45:52,420 --> 02:45:53,299
These need to be changed.

1996
02:45:53,299 --> 02:45:58,440
They've got to look a little different.

1997
02:45:58,440 --> 02:45:59,959
By the way, I'm going for it.

1998
02:45:59,959 --> 02:46:08,579
No, don't ever tell me that.

1999
02:46:08,579 --> 02:46:10,659
You can't, like, change that and make that look all right.

2000
02:46:11,299 --> 02:46:12,790
We're taking a photo.

2001
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:20,440
Look, you'll see what it's going to turn into.

2002
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:31,959
It's balding.

2003
02:46:31,959 --> 02:46:34,979
It's not balding.

2004
02:46:34,979 --> 02:46:41,829
Okay, I want to rotate this.

2005
02:46:59,860 --> 02:47:00,819
Not bad.

2006
02:47:00,819 --> 02:47:01,459
It's all right.

2007
02:47:01,459 --> 02:47:01,940
Not bad.

2008
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:08,149
These need to be changed.

2009
02:47:08,149 --> 02:47:09,670
They need to look a little better.

2010
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:11,030
I'm gonna add some more patterns on them.

2011
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:11,670
Some more rocks.

2012
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,479
Try and play Dreams, goddammit.

2013
02:47:38,479 --> 02:48:07,110
Get up here.

2014
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:08,870
No, mom, I'm studying.

2015
02:48:08,870 --> 02:48:13,889
I thought you were gonna show me the Vegas Strip.

2016
02:48:13,889 --> 02:48:14,209
No.

2017
02:48:24,370 --> 02:48:27,350
There needs to be more snow across it.

2018
02:48:27,350 --> 02:48:31,190
I'll fix it.

2019
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:32,950
This is gonna be nice and tidy in a minute.

2020
02:48:32,950 --> 02:48:33,270
This is...

2021
02:48:33,270 --> 02:48:34,950
I'm just trying to get the gist of it here.

2022
02:48:35,590 --> 02:48:50,069
Rome wasn't built in the day.

2023
02:48:50,629 --> 02:48:56,870
It was built in, like, fucking over the course of 75 years.

2024
02:48:57,590 --> 02:49:03,510
Results, results, results.

2025
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:04,629
I'll give you results.

2026
02:49:04,629 --> 02:49:05,670
I'm just gonna wait a little bit.

2027
02:49:06,229 --> 02:49:16,040
Just wait till I make my first video game on this spring.

2028
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:33,520
Now, that's really fucking terrible looking.

2029
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:39,840
I just don't need it.

2030
02:49:52,799 --> 02:49:56,479
Not bad.

2031
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:57,280
Maybe even more.

2032
02:49:57,280 --> 02:49:57,920
Ends lower.

2033
02:50:16,790 --> 02:50:20,639
A little too much snow.

2034
02:50:25,270 --> 02:50:53,700
Facial hair mountain.

2035
02:50:53,700 --> 02:50:54,340
Turn.

2036
02:50:54,340 --> 02:50:54,659
Tilt.

2037
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:56,899
Grab.

2038
02:50:57,719 --> 02:50:58,520
Tilt.

2039
02:50:58,520 --> 02:51:09,299
This just has more snow on it.

2040
02:51:09,299 --> 02:51:10,180
It's fine.

2041
02:51:10,180 --> 02:51:16,020
All right.

2042
02:51:16,020 --> 02:51:25,959
We're getting there.

2043
02:51:25,959 --> 02:51:26,920
Now, I need to make a...

2044
02:51:27,639 --> 02:51:30,209
This has to come out a little bit further.

2045
02:51:30,209 --> 02:51:36,370
There's not enough trees.

2046
02:51:36,370 --> 02:51:36,850
There's gotta be...

2047
02:51:37,969 --> 02:51:46,129
Maybe like a body of water.

2048
02:51:46,129 --> 02:51:47,090
Body of water.

2049
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:49,350
Yeah.

2050
02:51:49,350 --> 02:51:49,590
Yup.

2051
02:51:50,149 --> 02:51:54,309
Check this out.

2052
02:51:54,309 --> 02:51:54,549
All right.

2053
02:51:54,549 --> 02:51:55,750
This is gonna be done right.

2054
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:59,040
I'm gonna make, like, a big body of water right here.

2055
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:00,000
A big ice lake.

2056
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:09,120
How am I gonna do that, though?

2057
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:12,680
Paint tool?

2058
02:52:13,239 --> 02:52:22,930
And then do, like, circle?

2059
02:52:24,260 --> 02:52:25,540
Now, what does that look like?

2060
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:30,549
Let me just see what this looks like.

2061
02:52:31,110 --> 02:52:35,889
Now, it's gotta be denser than that.

2062
02:52:37,250 --> 02:52:38,610
Although it might not need to be.

2063
02:52:39,489 --> 02:52:47,000
That could be decent water.

2064
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:06,950
If it's painted on thick enough, it will be all right, I think.

2065
02:53:13,079 --> 02:53:14,440
Maybe a little bit of a...

2066
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:14,920
Let's see.

2067
02:53:22,079 --> 02:53:22,879
No, that's fine.

2068
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:26,629
And then I can do flow on it.

2069
02:53:26,629 --> 02:53:27,270
But what are the other...

2070
02:53:27,270 --> 02:53:28,229
Let me see the other shapes.

2071
02:53:30,399 --> 02:53:30,959
Square.

2072
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:43,489
Let's see.

2073
02:53:43,489 --> 02:53:44,209
Compare the two.

2074
02:53:45,170 --> 02:53:47,430
This one's a little more pixely.

2075
02:53:48,149 --> 02:53:51,780
Although I could do a different stroke here.

2076
02:53:51,780 --> 02:53:53,700
Let's try heavy.

2077
02:53:54,260 --> 02:53:59,889
That's heavy.

2078
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:04,399
Although this looks like ice crystals.

2079
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:13,489
You know what I'm saying?

2080
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:19,540
This is more water-like, but this is ice crystals and chunks of ice.

2081
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:22,000
Let me try something here.

2082
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:22,399
Hold on.

2083
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,309
Check this out.

2084
02:54:26,950 --> 02:54:29,479
Now, let's go with the square.

2085
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:53,250
I'm gonna change this.

2086
02:54:54,049 --> 02:54:57,040
Can I do a custom one of these?

2087
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:03,879
Okay.

2088
02:55:03,879 --> 02:55:05,170
I think I can.

2089
02:55:05,170 --> 02:55:06,049
Pure mixed.

2090
02:55:07,139 --> 02:55:08,260
Save color.

2091
02:55:08,260 --> 02:55:08,979
Clear mixer.

2092
02:55:09,540 --> 02:55:13,799
Let's go with this.

2093
02:55:15,409 --> 02:55:16,209
Add.

2094
02:55:16,209 --> 02:55:18,309
And then mix.

2095
02:55:18,309 --> 02:55:18,790
Tumble.

2096
02:55:25,569 --> 02:55:26,290
Save color.

2097
02:55:28,659 --> 02:55:29,299
And then can I...

2098
02:55:30,100 --> 02:55:32,979
Can I mix them up to make it so it's a gradient like the other ones?

2099
02:55:33,700 --> 02:55:38,040
Whoa.

2100
02:55:38,680 --> 02:55:39,559
That's not what I wanted.

2101
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:45,559
This has to be a way to get that...

2102
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:49,159
To do my own gradient.

2103
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:03,379
L1 and direction.

2104
02:56:03,379 --> 02:56:04,819
Now, let's just change in the frame.

2105
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:06,340
Mixed.

2106
02:56:07,219 --> 02:56:07,700
Well, wait.

2107
02:56:08,659 --> 02:56:10,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2108
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:10,479
Get over here.

2109
02:56:16,389 --> 02:56:16,790
Pure.

2110
02:56:17,670 --> 02:56:18,069
Mixed.

2111
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:23,170
I'll get it.

2112
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:30,959
I want to make my own gradient.

2113
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:34,579
Oh, well.

2114
02:56:34,579 --> 02:56:34,899
Fuck it.

2115
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:39,239
I'm just gonna go with like a light blue.

2116
02:56:39,239 --> 02:56:43,639
All right.

2117
02:56:43,639 --> 02:56:44,840
You can get out of here now.

2118
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:57,329
I actually kind of like the crystal-y ice looking one.

2119
02:56:57,889 --> 02:56:59,989
And I'll add the flow to it and comb it.

2120
02:57:00,629 --> 02:57:07,219
This is the most water-like, but I like this one.

2121
02:57:07,219 --> 02:57:09,559
All right.

2122
02:57:09,559 --> 02:57:09,959
Here we go.

2123
02:57:12,680 --> 02:57:15,559
So I need this to be a...

2124
02:57:15,559 --> 02:57:17,479
I need like a zone here.

2125
02:57:17,479 --> 02:57:18,899
What do I want this?

2126
02:57:18,899 --> 02:57:22,659
I want this to start here and come out this way.

2127
02:57:23,540 --> 02:57:24,899
Like that and go over here.

2128
02:57:28,979 --> 02:57:29,540
Let's try it.

2129
02:57:36,709 --> 02:57:37,590
It was this one.

2130
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,360
And it was this color.

2131
02:57:41,360 --> 02:57:42,399
It was this light one.

2132
02:57:44,069 --> 02:57:48,549
And it was wax, shiny metal, shiny.

2133
02:57:48,549 --> 02:57:49,270
It is water.

2134
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:52,319
Okay.

2135
02:57:58,360 --> 02:57:59,479
Nah, this won't be that much work.

2136
02:57:59,479 --> 02:58:00,040
Check this out.

2137
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:00,440
Watch this.

2138
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,319
I'm just gonna do it flat.

2139
02:58:03,319 --> 02:58:04,600
I'm gonna zoom out.

2140
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:06,360
I'm gonna get a ballpark here.

2141
02:58:06,360 --> 02:58:08,360
We'll do flat like this and check it out.

2142
02:58:08,360 --> 02:58:09,000
One, two, three.

2143
02:58:09,959 --> 02:58:17,920
Why is it on Kaleidoscope?

2144
02:58:20,079 --> 02:58:22,000
I never picked Kaleidoscope, did I?

2145
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:23,920
Wait, what the fuck is going on here?

2146
02:58:24,479 --> 02:58:27,569
What are you talking about?

2147
02:58:29,649 --> 02:58:31,010
Well, okay.

2148
02:58:37,440 --> 02:58:39,760
Looks like I'm just gonna have to paint a big one in front of my face.

2149
02:58:40,399 --> 02:58:54,209
And we're just gonna have to scale it.

2150
02:58:54,850 --> 02:59:07,430
Hydrate?

2151
02:59:09,010 --> 02:59:09,889
I will.

2152
02:59:09,889 --> 02:59:12,100
When I go on a break, I will.

2153
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:13,620
Don't worry, I will hydrate properly.

2154
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:23,700
Yeah, this looks nice and icy.

2155
02:59:24,260 --> 02:59:30,920
Once it starts to move around a little bit and I shape it.

2156
02:59:31,559 --> 02:59:34,280
How big does it need to be?

2157
02:59:40,899 --> 02:59:41,620
Actually pretty big.

2158
02:59:41,620 --> 02:59:43,299
So let's make it actually much bigger.

2159
03:00:00,579 --> 03:00:01,379
All right, here we go.

2160
03:00:01,379 --> 03:00:02,340
Let's try it.

2161
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:03,700
Let's just get it in there and see if I can...

2162
03:00:03,700 --> 03:00:04,739
I can always fix it later.

2163
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:10,579
Well, okay.

2164
03:00:11,540 --> 03:00:12,659
Did not know that was happening.

2165
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:14,579
So we're gonna take the...

2166
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:20,899
Give me a break.

2167
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:43,559
Okay, for this one, let's just get it over there.

2168
03:00:44,360 --> 03:00:51,190
I need to just get it out here.

2169
03:00:58,719 --> 03:01:00,319
I can add to it in a minute.

2170
03:01:00,319 --> 03:01:01,360
Let's put it right here.

2171
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,680
So I need a lot more paint on this.

2172
03:01:12,049 --> 03:01:14,049
A lot more and then it has to wrap around here.

2173
03:01:17,780 --> 03:01:18,180
Let's go.

2174
03:01:18,819 --> 03:01:28,719
Bring it over here.

2175
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:29,280
What are you doing?

2176
03:01:33,809 --> 03:01:35,889
Let's do brush is fine.

2177
03:01:36,850 --> 03:01:38,370
I'm gonna snap to surface.

2178
03:01:39,250 --> 03:01:46,290
So it should be snapping to here.

2179
03:01:47,090 --> 03:01:47,969
All right, here we go.

2180
03:01:48,530 --> 03:02:00,120
Why is this a different color?

2181
03:02:00,680 --> 03:02:08,209
It's not.

2182
03:02:08,209 --> 03:02:09,489
It's just a weird shadow.

2183
03:02:10,129 --> 03:02:19,360
And there was a spot here that I need to fill in.

2184
03:02:19,360 --> 03:02:34,950
There we go.

2185
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:38,389
Imagine playing MS Paint with a PS4 controller.

2186
03:02:41,780 --> 03:02:44,770
I mean, I think you're wrong,

2187
03:02:44,770 --> 03:02:47,170
but you're also not wrong at the same time.

2188
03:02:47,170 --> 03:02:49,649
You know what I mean?

2189
03:02:50,129 --> 03:03:05,000
Okay, it does look pretty icy.

2190
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,200
Needs to come across here.

2191
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:25,280
I mean, we don't care about

2192
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:31,059
what it looks like underneath at the moment.

2193
03:03:31,059 --> 03:03:41,750
It just needs to exist.

2194
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:44,149
Because all that matters is like here,

2195
03:03:44,149 --> 03:03:47,719
a little bit over here too.

2196
03:03:47,719 --> 03:04:02,500
It's messy, but it'll get the job done.

2197
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:03,079
It will.

2198
03:04:11,329 --> 03:04:13,780
No, it don't matter.

2199
03:04:13,780 --> 03:04:14,260
It don't matter.

2200
03:04:14,260 --> 03:04:15,780
It just needs to get the job done.

2201
03:04:15,780 --> 03:04:24,469
Because guess what?

2202
03:04:24,469 --> 03:04:42,049
Now I put like a boulder over here.

2203
03:04:42,049 --> 03:04:42,770
Check this, right?

2204
03:04:48,129 --> 03:04:49,729
Now give me the, like this.

2205
03:04:50,530 --> 03:04:54,520
I'm just gonna see.

2206
03:04:54,520 --> 03:04:55,879
I'm just gonna test something.

2207
03:04:55,879 --> 03:05:24,389
Okay, and then it's gonna come up here.

2208
03:05:25,350 --> 03:05:30,319
Actually, one big one right here.

2209
03:05:31,120 --> 03:05:45,479
See, this is the, okay.

2210
03:05:45,479 --> 03:05:46,600
I just got a quest.

2211
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:47,959
Okay, this is the worst part, right?

2212
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:50,200
I want to like move it down,

2213
03:05:51,250 --> 03:05:54,040
but I can't move it down.

2214
03:05:54,040 --> 03:05:55,239
Because it moves my imp.

2215
03:05:55,799 --> 03:05:59,399
I just want to move this thing I'm holding straight down.

2216
03:06:02,899 --> 03:06:03,940
It's almost like I have to go

2217
03:06:03,940 --> 03:06:05,219
with like a strange angle

2218
03:06:05,219 --> 03:06:07,620
to like move this back and forth where I want to.

2219
03:06:08,340 --> 03:06:23,250
Like, I don't want to move the camera forward.

2220
03:06:23,250 --> 03:06:25,409
I want to move this forward.

2221
03:06:25,409 --> 03:06:27,319
You know what I'm saying?

2222
03:06:31,329 --> 03:06:39,329
Like, this is a tutorial.

2223
03:06:39,329 --> 03:06:41,489
I mean, I did the tutorials already.

2224
03:06:41,489 --> 03:06:48,309
Because I can go like this.

2225
03:06:48,309 --> 03:06:52,469
I can move in and out and all around.

2226
03:06:52,469 --> 03:06:54,639
I can circle.

2227
03:06:54,639 --> 03:06:57,879
I can go up and down, left and right.

2228
03:06:57,879 --> 03:07:00,680
But I want to just move this thing

2229
03:07:00,680 --> 03:07:02,680
that I'm holding forward and backward.

2230
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:04,639
You know what I'm saying?

2231
03:07:05,909 --> 03:07:07,430
Is it the snap surface thing?

2232
03:07:08,229 --> 03:07:12,879
Is that, okay.

2233
03:07:13,520 --> 03:07:15,700
Oh, Jesus Christ.

2234
03:07:15,700 --> 03:07:16,659
That's not what I wanted to do.

2235
03:07:17,379 --> 03:07:26,309
Yeah, but even still though.

2236
03:07:26,309 --> 03:07:27,670
Okay, so snap surface is off.

2237
03:07:28,389 --> 03:07:29,670
And this is where it gets weird.

2238
03:07:29,670 --> 03:07:31,989
All right, so when I'm holding a device

2239
03:07:32,709 --> 03:07:35,829
and I hold back, the camera doesn't move.

2240
03:07:38,069 --> 03:07:39,909
It's like weird how the camera...

2241
03:07:39,909 --> 03:07:42,309
This controls the camera and it also controls...

2242
03:07:42,309 --> 03:07:42,950
You see what I'm saying?

2243
03:07:44,959 --> 03:07:46,879
I don't want to move forward.

2244
03:07:46,879 --> 03:07:49,719
I just want to move this.

2245
03:07:49,719 --> 03:07:51,479
Let me move this thing forward.

2246
03:07:51,479 --> 03:07:52,840
No, let's move the camera too.

2247
03:07:54,639 --> 03:07:55,360
That's awful.

2248
03:07:55,920 --> 03:08:00,450
Does it have to do that?

2249
03:08:02,180 --> 03:08:03,379
This is to lock the camera.

2250
03:08:04,020 --> 03:08:05,459
But when you lock the camera,

2251
03:08:05,459 --> 03:08:06,819
you just move in and out and all around.

2252
03:08:10,200 --> 03:08:11,639
There has to be a way where you can

2253
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:14,600
not move the camera and just move the device.

2254
03:08:18,129 --> 03:08:19,809
You would think it would be maybe like an R?

2255
03:08:19,809 --> 03:08:20,770
Like one of the Rs?

2256
03:08:20,770 --> 03:08:21,729
No, let's rewind.

2257
03:08:22,450 --> 03:08:25,250
Well, whatever.

2258
03:08:25,250 --> 03:08:26,690
That's a minor complaint, but it is...

2259
03:08:27,489 --> 03:08:29,139
I just don't like when the camera moves.

2260
03:08:29,139 --> 03:08:30,500
I wish I could just stop the camera from moving.

2261
03:08:31,139 --> 03:08:39,639
You know, let's see how...

2262
03:08:39,639 --> 03:08:40,280
No, no, no, no.

2263
03:08:41,620 --> 03:09:02,000
No, I want the rounded one.

2264
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:02,639
No, I don't.

2265
03:09:02,639 --> 03:09:03,280
What do I want?

2266
03:09:04,079 --> 03:09:05,059
What do I want?

2267
03:09:06,180 --> 03:09:08,879
There we go.

2268
03:09:30,239 --> 03:09:31,200
No, too fleshy.

2269
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:32,899
That's not terrible.

2270
03:09:49,670 --> 03:09:50,170
No!

2271
03:10:07,079 --> 03:10:10,200
It's his hand coming up from the other side.

2272
03:10:15,649 --> 03:10:17,729
It's somebody else reaching up here.

2273
03:10:25,639 --> 03:10:26,680
There's somebody down here.

2274
03:10:29,590 --> 03:10:30,069
No, no.

2275
03:10:30,069 --> 03:10:30,309
All right.

2276
03:10:30,309 --> 03:10:32,149
Let's get this rock and frosty colored.

2277
03:10:32,149 --> 03:10:33,270
And then I got to change this

2278
03:10:33,909 --> 03:10:35,110
because this needs to be like a little...

2279
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:35,670
This has to be...

2280
03:10:35,670 --> 03:10:36,549
Well, it could be just ice.

2281
03:10:37,350 --> 03:10:38,870
It doesn't have to be that.

2282
03:10:39,670 --> 03:10:45,520
It's a giant drowned in the lake.

2283
03:10:46,079 --> 03:10:49,719
You know, I'm sure this looks really good in his head.

2284
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:59,159
It didn't look like anything in my head.

2285
03:10:59,159 --> 03:10:59,479
You know what?

2286
03:10:59,479 --> 03:10:59,959
Yeah, fuck it.

2287
03:10:59,959 --> 03:11:01,239
That's a metal hand.

2288
03:11:01,239 --> 03:11:26,959
Change the tint.

2289
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:38,920
This is going to be called the War of the Giants.

2290
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:46,879
What color do I want this to be?

2291
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:55,090
Don't you think it should be called that?

2292
03:11:55,090 --> 03:11:59,430
Okay, that looks better.

2293
03:11:59,989 --> 03:12:01,520
And now let's shape...

2294
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:02,079
Okay, hold on.

2295
03:12:02,079 --> 03:12:03,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2296
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:14,129
That's a hand grabbing.

2297
03:12:14,129 --> 03:12:15,090
It's like right hand.

2298
03:12:15,649 --> 03:12:16,770
Face needs to be here.

2299
03:12:17,329 --> 03:12:30,069
Now I want some junior mints.

2300
03:12:31,510 --> 03:12:38,000
Hold on.

2301
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:38,719
Just wait.

2302
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:39,200
Wait.

2303
03:12:39,200 --> 03:12:40,159
I'm studying.

2304
03:12:40,159 --> 03:12:44,319
Let me open up the menu.

2305
03:12:44,319 --> 03:12:45,360
I got to do the ice first.

2306
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:46,079
Hold on.

2307
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:47,280
Everybody's freaking out.

2308
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:52,309
I need...

2309
03:12:52,870 --> 03:12:53,969
We need some glow.

2310
03:12:54,530 --> 03:12:57,489
Needs to be bright blue.

2311
03:12:58,209 --> 03:13:06,899
Okay.

2312
03:13:07,459 --> 03:13:12,639
The finish is already a shiny metal.

2313
03:13:12,639 --> 03:13:13,840
Let's go ahead and apply it though.

2314
03:13:17,909 --> 03:13:21,159
Not that shiny.

2315
03:13:21,159 --> 03:13:27,940
Okay.

2316
03:13:27,940 --> 03:13:29,139
Let's go to effects.

2317
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:31,590
Flow.

2318
03:13:32,149 --> 03:13:52,000
Too much flow.

2319
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,520
It is ice, you're right.

2320
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:58,680
We need a little bit though.

2321
03:13:58,680 --> 03:13:59,559
Just a little.

2322
03:13:59,559 --> 03:14:02,930
No, you're right.

2323
03:14:02,930 --> 03:14:03,409
No flow.

2324
03:14:03,969 --> 03:14:09,670
Boil.

2325
03:14:09,670 --> 03:14:10,790
It's boiling.

2326
03:14:12,629 --> 03:14:13,190
Ha, ha, ha.

2327
03:14:25,989 --> 03:14:28,309
Yeah, because it's going to be fire flowing down into it.

2328
03:14:28,309 --> 03:14:29,110
No, stop it.

2329
03:14:29,110 --> 03:14:29,510
Stop it.

2330
03:14:29,510 --> 03:14:30,950
Just like I need to finish this thing.

2331
03:14:31,510 --> 03:14:47,239
Wasn't I going to make like a game?

2332
03:14:47,239 --> 03:14:47,719
I need...

2333
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:50,600
How are these looking?

2334
03:14:50,600 --> 03:14:51,639
These are moving a little bit.

2335
03:14:51,639 --> 03:14:52,760
We need some more sounds.

2336
03:14:54,739 --> 03:14:56,340
What is playing right now?

2337
03:14:56,899 --> 03:14:58,479
Hold on.

2338
03:14:58,479 --> 03:15:00,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2339
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:04,639
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2340
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:21,030
That's too much wind.

2341
03:15:21,030 --> 03:15:31,729
It's kind of just spinning around.

2342
03:15:31,729 --> 03:15:32,290
Where is...

2343
03:15:36,069 --> 03:15:36,870
Holy shit.

2344
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:47,079
Whoa.

2345
03:15:48,239 --> 03:15:49,040
Ha, ha, ha.

2346
03:15:59,170 --> 03:16:00,530
I don't hate this.

2347
03:16:00,530 --> 03:16:02,370
I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.

2348
03:16:02,370 --> 03:16:12,549
Wait, hold on.

2349
03:16:12,549 --> 03:16:38,770
Damn.

2350
03:16:38,770 --> 03:16:40,049
It's like the ice.

2351
03:16:42,079 --> 03:16:42,799
Okay, hold on.

2352
03:16:42,799 --> 03:16:43,360
I need to get...

2353
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:44,639
I got an idea.

2354
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:46,239
Idea, idea, idea.

2355
03:16:46,239 --> 03:16:46,719
Back it up.

2356
03:16:48,739 --> 03:16:50,739
I'm going to make more of this on the ice.

2357
03:16:50,739 --> 03:16:57,780
Okay, close this.

2358
03:16:57,780 --> 03:17:07,159
Let's make this a little cleaner.

2359
03:17:07,159 --> 03:17:23,959
All right, so now I want to put...

2360
03:17:24,760 --> 03:17:25,799
Check this shit out.

2361
03:17:25,799 --> 03:17:31,360
You're going to see a real five trillion IQ hyper brain.

2362
03:17:35,760 --> 03:17:39,520
We're going to do some lines here.

2363
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:40,159
Just a few.

2364
03:17:40,159 --> 03:17:48,260
Just like one of them to paint mode.

2365
03:17:48,260 --> 03:17:50,690
We're going to do a...

2366
03:17:52,559 --> 03:17:53,760
Don't want the surface snap.

2367
03:17:56,180 --> 03:18:02,469
I want a straight line and I want it to be a mist.

2368
03:18:04,209 --> 03:18:05,569
So I don't know.

2369
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:10,159
This doesn't look bad.

2370
03:18:10,159 --> 03:18:11,120
The scribble is okay.

2371
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:12,079
I think the scribble will do it.

2372
03:18:12,719 --> 03:18:14,079
Let me see what the scribble looks like.

2373
03:18:15,670 --> 03:18:16,149
Absolutely.

2374
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:20,069
Okay, so here let's show what...

2375
03:18:20,069 --> 03:18:21,350
I'm going to show you what I'm talking about here.

2376
03:18:21,829 --> 03:18:24,559
We're going to get the scribble.

2377
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:30,129
I'm going to make sure it is white or blue.

2378
03:18:31,350 --> 03:18:34,500
Yeah, yeah, it's going to be blue.

2379
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,940
Oh, just wait till you see what happens.

2380
03:18:35,940 --> 03:18:36,739
You're going to fucking...

2381
03:18:36,739 --> 03:18:40,180
Everyone's going to resubscribe after you unsubscribe.

2382
03:18:40,739 --> 03:18:45,649
Everyone's going to just resubscribe right now.

2383
03:18:45,649 --> 03:18:52,280
Okay, here we go.

2384
03:18:52,280 --> 03:19:05,030
All right, okay, easy.

2385
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:08,159
Take this.

2386
03:19:08,959 --> 03:19:18,530
All right.

2387
03:19:18,530 --> 03:19:31,809
Hold on, hold on.

2388
03:19:32,450 --> 03:19:55,680
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2389
03:19:55,760 --> 03:20:01,989
Light sphere, now I need...

2390
03:20:02,629 --> 03:20:16,479
Wait, we've got five community subs.

2391
03:20:16,479 --> 03:20:19,969
Holy shit, five community subs.

2392
03:20:19,969 --> 03:20:20,770
Fucking shitting me.

2393
03:20:25,280 --> 03:20:27,520
Thank you to Torati for the five subs.

2394
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:31,760
Where's the way I can make it so they...

2395
03:20:32,479 --> 03:20:34,559
It's a pulse or something.

2396
03:20:36,069 --> 03:20:37,510
Fade in, fade out.

2397
03:20:37,510 --> 03:20:38,229
No, no, no.

2398
03:20:38,790 --> 03:20:40,840
It's called something.

2399
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:44,149
What the fuck is it called?

2400
03:20:44,149 --> 03:20:45,190
It's called like Pulse.

2401
03:20:46,360 --> 03:20:46,920
Where is it?

2402
03:20:53,059 --> 03:20:53,620
Pulse.

2403
03:20:53,620 --> 03:20:54,180
Where is it?

2404
03:20:54,180 --> 03:20:55,139
I know it exists.

2405
03:20:57,329 --> 03:20:57,729
Pulse.

2406
03:21:01,969 --> 03:21:04,479
Ooh, okay.

2407
03:21:05,120 --> 03:21:17,479
Okay, hold on.

2408
03:21:17,959 --> 03:21:38,290
Plane, inside sphere.

2409
03:21:38,290 --> 03:21:39,889
I think inside sphere is probably the best.

2410
03:21:42,079 --> 03:21:43,520
This guy hates his fan.

2411
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:46,000
Salmon or breakfast?

2412
03:21:47,200 --> 03:21:48,719
Salmon is I think is...

2413
03:21:48,719 --> 03:21:49,920
I definitely didn't say anything,

2414
03:21:49,920 --> 03:21:51,200
but I'm going to say salmon.

2415
03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:56,639
There, there's like a little bit of mist.

2416
03:21:58,020 --> 03:22:06,600
Scale, jitter, probably like that.

2417
03:22:07,159 --> 03:22:13,700
And then we can do...

2418
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:14,819
We can take off the fades.

2419
03:22:15,620 --> 03:22:20,469
Maybe do the playback.

2420
03:22:20,469 --> 03:22:21,750
Maybe do it faster.

2421
03:22:22,389 --> 03:22:23,590
Where's like playback speed?

2422
03:22:24,309 --> 03:22:31,729
No, no, no, no, no.

2423
03:22:32,049 --> 03:22:36,799
Ha ha ha.

2424
03:22:36,799 --> 03:22:39,360
Now what would that even be?

2425
03:22:39,360 --> 03:22:40,959
Now all I have to do is go like this.

2426
03:22:51,190 --> 03:22:51,909
Check this out.

2427
03:22:52,469 --> 03:22:55,559
I'm going to do like five or two or three percent.

2428
03:22:55,559 --> 03:22:57,479
This is going to be underneath the ice.

2429
03:22:57,479 --> 03:22:58,520
This is what I'm going for here.

2430
03:22:59,319 --> 03:23:03,190
So it's going to be like crackling ice.

2431
03:23:04,629 --> 03:23:11,719
Yeah, now you get it.

2432
03:23:17,889 --> 03:23:18,530
There we go.

2433
03:23:19,090 --> 03:23:25,399
Now we can just stretch it out a little.

2434
03:23:26,040 --> 03:23:47,040
That's what I want right there.

2435
03:23:47,920 --> 03:24:04,629
Come on, do the dumb thing I want.

2436
03:24:04,629 --> 03:24:05,590
Oh, it's so close.

2437
03:24:05,590 --> 03:24:06,469
No, don't touch that.

2438
03:24:09,059 --> 03:24:10,020
It's so close.

2439
03:24:10,579 --> 03:25:03,040
Oh, I like it.

2440
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:06,340
I think that's all right.

2441
03:25:06,340 --> 03:25:16,100
I almost had it broken up a little bit more.

2442
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:17,059
Let me look at it one more time.

2443
03:25:17,620 --> 03:25:23,780
Definitely doesn't need to be that bright.

2444
03:25:23,780 --> 03:25:28,020
Are you kidding me?

2445
03:25:29,280 --> 03:25:30,319
Like, are you kidding me?

2446
03:25:39,329 --> 03:25:41,889
There's a goddamn old one under there.

2447
03:25:41,889 --> 03:26:08,000
How does that look?

2448
03:26:08,559 --> 03:26:15,559
I like it like that.

2449
03:26:16,200 --> 03:26:18,950
And then check this.

2450
03:26:18,950 --> 03:26:19,829
What we're going to do is this.

2451
03:26:23,430 --> 03:26:26,770
I'm going to mess that up a little bit more.

2452
03:26:32,200 --> 03:26:33,079
Need a little bit more.

2453
03:26:33,079 --> 03:26:33,559
We need a...

2454
03:26:34,520 --> 03:26:35,719
Okay, clones.

2455
03:26:35,719 --> 03:26:36,920
We need less clones.

2456
03:26:37,639 --> 03:26:42,370
That's so much better.

2457
03:26:42,370 --> 03:26:42,850
Look at that.

2458
03:26:43,569 --> 03:26:46,450
I love it.

2459
03:26:46,450 --> 03:26:47,649
I don't think I want to change anything.

2460
03:26:48,370 --> 03:26:52,520
Except for that.

2461
03:26:52,520 --> 03:26:53,239
Fuck.

2462
03:26:53,239 --> 03:27:28,200
I got it.

2463
03:27:37,750 --> 03:27:38,790
And wait, wait, wait, wait.

2464
03:27:38,790 --> 03:27:39,190
That's not all.

2465
03:27:39,190 --> 03:27:39,670
That's not all.

2466
03:27:39,670 --> 03:27:40,389
Hold on.

2467
03:27:40,389 --> 03:27:45,920
I'm going to loosen it up a little.

2468
03:27:45,920 --> 03:27:46,799
So it doesn't look so...

2469
03:27:47,360 --> 03:27:54,950
Let's see how that looks.

2470
03:28:05,219 --> 03:28:05,700
Ruined?

2471
03:28:05,700 --> 03:28:06,500
What do you mean ruined?

2472
03:28:06,500 --> 03:28:07,139
Did I ruin it?

2473
03:28:09,170 --> 03:28:09,889
It's a little too...

2474
03:28:09,889 --> 03:28:10,850
Yeah, a little too much.

2475
03:28:10,850 --> 03:28:11,569
Okay, what about...

2476
03:28:12,709 --> 03:28:14,069
Okay, this is important.

2477
03:28:14,549 --> 03:28:18,260
No, it's not.

2478
03:28:18,260 --> 03:28:18,659
This is...

2479
03:28:18,659 --> 03:28:19,059
Here we go.

2480
03:28:19,059 --> 03:28:19,860
Let's try roughing it up.

2481
03:28:24,389 --> 03:28:25,270
Oops.

2482
03:28:25,270 --> 03:28:26,309
Wow, look at that ice.

2483
03:28:38,020 --> 03:28:39,059
And it made it perfect.

2484
03:28:39,620 --> 03:28:57,479
That's perfect.

2485
03:28:57,479 --> 03:28:58,760
Loosen it up a little bit, though.

2486
03:28:59,319 --> 03:29:06,440
That doesn't need to be as harsh.

2487
03:29:09,989 --> 03:29:11,190
Now I have to change the sky.

2488
03:29:12,979 --> 03:29:13,379
I will.

2489
03:29:13,379 --> 03:29:13,780
I will.

2490
03:29:13,780 --> 03:29:14,500
Don't worry.

2491
03:29:14,500 --> 03:29:14,899
I will.

2492
03:29:15,620 --> 03:29:36,079
All right.

2493
03:29:36,079 --> 03:29:43,440
Let's get a sun over here.

2494
03:29:43,440 --> 03:29:45,729
How do I cover the...

2495
03:29:45,729 --> 03:29:46,370
Hmm.

2496
03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:49,700
More trees that look bad in just one corner?

2497
03:29:52,600 --> 03:29:53,639
Yeah, you're right.

2498
03:29:53,639 --> 03:29:55,780
You're right.

2499
03:29:55,780 --> 03:29:56,260
You're right.

2500
03:29:56,260 --> 03:29:56,739
No, you are.

2501
03:29:57,459 --> 03:30:06,149
I'm going to say let's get over here maybe.

2502
03:30:06,149 --> 03:30:14,309
We're going to play around with some scale here, guys.

2503
03:30:14,309 --> 03:30:15,110
Watch this shit.

2504
03:30:24,340 --> 03:30:26,100
That could be like a fucking mile away.

2505
03:30:26,979 --> 03:30:47,110
What am I making?

2506
03:30:47,110 --> 03:30:49,270
Oh, it's just kind of whatever at this point.

2507
03:30:49,909 --> 03:30:50,870
I don't really have a plan.

2508
03:30:50,870 --> 03:30:52,469
I'm just kind of making random stuff.

2509
03:30:53,430 --> 03:30:56,100
Move this around though.

2510
03:30:56,100 --> 03:30:57,139
It looks too perfect.

2511
03:30:58,020 --> 03:31:11,270
Yeah, this has got to go on the ground.

2512
03:31:12,389 --> 03:31:17,520
I can put a little forest back here.

2513
03:31:26,930 --> 03:31:29,090
Yeah, that looks bad.

2514
03:31:40,370 --> 03:31:40,690
Don't worry.

2515
03:31:40,690 --> 03:31:42,530
I'm going to go in here and I'm going to ruffle them up.

2516
03:31:42,530 --> 03:31:59,159
Coming together over there.

2517
03:31:59,159 --> 03:32:02,260
Although this is a little too big.

2518
03:32:02,899 --> 03:32:07,280
Did I walk something up here?

2519
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:11,139
Oh, I did.

2520
03:32:12,370 --> 03:32:12,690
Oops.

2521
03:32:13,489 --> 03:32:31,459
Are the shirts a limited time?

2522
03:32:31,459 --> 03:32:32,340
No, they're here forever.

2523
03:32:32,899 --> 03:32:35,670
I got to get the giant hair?

2524
03:32:35,670 --> 03:32:36,389
I will.

2525
03:32:36,389 --> 03:32:45,440
Let me see the whole thing.

2526
03:32:45,440 --> 03:32:46,079
What is this?

2527
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:56,290
I feel like I want to...

2528
03:32:56,290 --> 03:32:57,409
All right.

2529
03:32:57,409 --> 03:32:58,450
Hear me out on this one.

2530
03:33:37,989 --> 03:33:41,409
It's just a little too perfect for me.

2531
03:33:42,209 --> 03:33:47,840
That's okay.

2532
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:49,920
Let's do the snow too.

2533
03:33:50,559 --> 03:34:04,799
That's kind of cool looking.

2534
03:34:05,440 --> 03:34:16,739
That is really cool looking actually.

2535
03:34:18,930 --> 03:34:20,049
They're frozen like that.

2536
03:34:27,639 --> 03:34:31,170
No, that's fine.

2537
03:34:31,170 --> 03:34:32,290
It looks okay.

2538
03:34:32,290 --> 03:34:33,969
All right, let's do some work over here.

2539
03:34:34,450 --> 03:34:44,850
This game seems amazing if you can't draw and want to make art for fun.

2540
03:34:48,079 --> 03:34:50,879
All you have seen me do is just dick around.

2541
03:34:50,879 --> 03:34:51,440
That's it.

2542
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:52,399
I haven't done anything else.

2543
03:34:53,120 --> 03:35:01,010
I've done nothing else but dick around.

2544
03:35:01,569 --> 03:35:05,590
Let's do a little bit of work here though.

2545
03:35:05,590 --> 03:35:06,309
Because I need...

2546
03:35:06,309 --> 03:35:07,350
You need hair.

2547
03:35:07,350 --> 03:35:17,719
What kind of hair though?

2548
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:19,920
Snap it to...

2549
03:35:20,959 --> 03:35:21,360
Yep.

2550
03:35:28,229 --> 03:35:29,030
Studio lighting.

2551
03:35:29,030 --> 03:35:30,149
I want to change the lights.

2552
03:35:30,790 --> 03:35:32,229
There has to be a way I can do that.

2553
03:35:33,030 --> 03:35:33,590
Has to be.

2554
03:35:35,430 --> 03:35:35,750
Right?

2555
03:35:36,309 --> 03:35:40,319
All right, hair.

2556
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:46,639
He has made it a metal or stone or whatever it's going to end up being.

2557
03:35:47,440 --> 03:35:52,370
He looks like Beaker.

2558
03:35:52,370 --> 03:35:54,049
Yeah, he's really not really supposed to be here.

2559
03:36:08,639 --> 03:36:09,920
Wait, why is it...

2560
03:36:12,100 --> 03:36:14,100
Oh, it's because it's shiny metal hair.

2561
03:36:16,309 --> 03:36:17,190
Okay, right.

2562
03:36:18,159 --> 03:36:18,799
Makes sense.

2563
03:36:19,520 --> 03:36:28,709
Why do I feel like this is going to take up all the frame rate?

2564
03:36:49,909 --> 03:36:52,709
This looks like the shittiest toupee you could ever wear.

2565
03:36:52,709 --> 03:37:07,760
Am I going to change this?

2566
03:37:09,639 --> 03:37:10,040
Oops.

2567
03:37:10,600 --> 03:37:15,840
Well, that's fine.

2568
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:16,799
Who cares?

2569
03:37:16,799 --> 03:37:21,059
I'm going to have like a little spike.

2570
03:37:29,239 --> 03:37:30,520
No, it's a bird's nest.

2571
03:37:30,520 --> 03:37:40,899
I'm just going to put a bird in here.

2572
03:37:59,829 --> 03:38:04,309
He punched him so hard at his hair.

2573
03:38:04,309 --> 03:38:13,520
Okay, well, it's because I'm drawing in 3D.

2574
03:38:13,520 --> 03:38:15,040
It's because I have snapping on.

2575
03:38:15,040 --> 03:38:28,290
Fuck it, let's go wild with this shit.

2576
03:38:28,290 --> 03:38:28,930
Wild, yeah.

2577
03:38:28,930 --> 03:38:30,290
You know, wild I say.

2578
03:38:30,290 --> 03:39:09,399
He has cosmic horror hair.

2579
03:39:23,510 --> 03:39:32,159
You can't even tell what's going on from over here.

2580
03:39:32,159 --> 03:39:34,319
Dude, I've got a fucking idea.

2581
03:39:34,319 --> 03:39:35,280
Are you serious?

2582
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:36,159
You know what I'm going to do?

2583
03:39:36,159 --> 03:39:37,120
Are you serious?

2584
03:39:38,209 --> 03:39:39,329
I'm going to have it just...

2585
03:39:39,329 --> 03:39:40,049
No, never mind.

2586
03:39:40,049 --> 03:39:41,489
It's going to take like about three hours.

2587
03:39:42,290 --> 03:39:51,700
I definitely have to make his hair flowing like crazy though.

2588
03:39:52,340 --> 03:39:57,219
And he needs more hair up here.

2589
03:40:07,540 --> 03:40:09,860
Smaller, smaller flex here.

2590
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:11,459
This is kind of getting out of hand.

2591
03:40:12,020 --> 03:40:14,049
And I'm going to turn off the snapping.

2592
03:40:45,969 --> 03:40:47,569
That's part of the platformer.

2593
03:40:49,090 --> 03:40:50,049
Look, wait, wait.

2594
03:40:50,049 --> 03:40:51,010
Oh, boy.

2595
03:40:51,010 --> 03:40:51,489
More...

2596
03:40:51,489 --> 03:40:52,290
Oh, it's a step.

2597
03:40:52,290 --> 03:40:53,170
Turning this into a level.

2598
03:40:53,889 --> 03:41:00,399
You have to jump through here.

2599
03:41:00,399 --> 03:41:02,399
You got to go around the whole goddamn robot.

2600
03:41:02,959 --> 03:41:09,809
The whole thing is going to be scalable.

2601
03:41:19,959 --> 03:41:20,920
Yeah, you got to run up his hair.

2602
03:41:21,479 --> 03:41:25,059
So check this out.

2603
03:41:25,059 --> 03:41:25,540
All right.

2604
03:41:25,540 --> 03:41:29,940
Hold on.

2605
03:41:29,940 --> 03:41:32,530
Down and like flowing down.

2606
03:41:32,530 --> 03:41:33,969
I need to see from a clear angle.

2607
03:41:34,530 --> 03:41:41,350
Flow it down and come across.

2608
03:41:42,309 --> 03:41:43,479
Now, let's go.

2609
03:41:43,479 --> 03:41:44,840
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2610
03:41:44,840 --> 03:41:45,799
The hair is going to...

2611
03:41:46,440 --> 03:41:47,959
There's going to be another thing going on right here.

2612
03:41:48,600 --> 03:41:54,879
We'll do that later.

2613
03:41:55,440 --> 03:41:58,040
We're going to make a head right here.

2614
03:42:02,879 --> 03:42:03,360
God damn it.

2615
03:42:03,360 --> 03:42:04,239
This is so in the way.

2616
03:42:05,860 --> 03:42:06,340
It's okay.

2617
03:42:06,979 --> 03:42:36,159
It's just like a tiny head.

2618
03:42:36,879 --> 03:43:09,190
Okay.

2619
03:43:55,399 --> 03:43:56,440
Is this on Steam?

2620
03:43:56,440 --> 03:43:57,239
No, it's not.

2621
03:43:57,239 --> 03:44:00,040
It's only for PlayStation 4, which is very unfortunate.

2622
03:44:00,040 --> 03:44:07,750
The eyes need to be bigger.

2623
03:44:07,750 --> 03:44:17,750
Nah, I like it better like this.

2624
03:44:17,750 --> 03:44:20,879
He looks like a pumpkin.

2625
03:44:20,879 --> 03:44:22,239
Just wait.

2626
03:44:23,760 --> 03:44:31,729
Um, a party hat.

2627
03:44:37,540 --> 03:44:38,500
It's a baseball cap.

2628
03:44:39,059 --> 03:45:14,200
Okay.

2629
03:45:14,200 --> 03:45:25,569
Now he needs to be metal.

2630
03:45:25,569 --> 03:45:44,610
He's a Tintin.

2631
03:45:44,610 --> 03:45:49,700
He's got to have one on like a purple hat.

2632
03:45:50,340 --> 03:46:10,879
Whoa, wheezy.

2633
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:14,290
It's the Iron Giant.

2634
03:46:16,389 --> 03:46:18,469
It kind of is the Iron Giant in a way.

2635
03:46:18,469 --> 03:46:19,030
All right.

2636
03:46:19,030 --> 03:46:20,149
Apply the finish.

2637
03:46:20,149 --> 03:46:25,479
I want shiny metal, but I do not want it to be that stupid thing.

2638
03:46:25,479 --> 03:46:28,040
I want it to be the like spray can.

2639
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,510
I don't know why it's on this dumb thing.

2640
03:46:32,309 --> 03:46:37,620
It's on like the spray can.

2641
03:46:44,799 --> 03:46:46,000
How did I get it off this before?

2642
03:46:46,879 --> 03:46:49,540
I just wanted to do it.

2643
03:46:50,260 --> 03:46:51,780
How did I get it off this before?

2644
03:46:51,780 --> 03:46:52,260
I don't remember.

2645
03:46:53,139 --> 03:46:54,100
It's over here.

2646
03:46:54,100 --> 03:46:57,889
Apply finish.

2647
03:46:57,889 --> 03:46:59,959
Let's make him nice and shiny.

2648
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:09,840
I don't like the color.

2649
03:47:20,209 --> 03:47:20,690
No.

2650
03:47:20,690 --> 03:47:22,049
Let's go back to like metal.

2651
03:47:23,010 --> 03:47:24,370
The actual kind of chrome look.

2652
03:47:25,090 --> 03:47:37,399
He looks like he's made out of wood.

2653
03:47:38,040 --> 03:47:39,719
His head needs to be a little bigger too.

2654
03:47:40,360 --> 03:48:04,659
Okay.

2655
03:48:04,659 --> 03:48:14,319
Okay.

2656
03:48:14,959 --> 03:48:18,290
He's Mario.

2657
03:48:20,260 --> 03:48:22,420
He looks like a Roblox character.

2658
03:48:23,139 --> 03:48:24,340
All right.

2659
03:48:24,340 --> 03:48:25,459
Now we're getting somewhere.

2660
03:48:27,090 --> 03:48:29,729
Now we need a face over here because that's his hand.

2661
03:48:30,370 --> 03:48:53,430
I need to see from the other side.

2662
03:48:53,430 --> 03:48:53,909
Here we go.

2663
03:49:14,870 --> 03:49:16,870
Have him peeking over with a big nose.

2664
03:49:18,069 --> 03:49:20,309
You mean like that cartoon character?

2665
03:49:25,909 --> 03:49:27,590
That weird cartoon nose thing.

2666
03:49:27,590 --> 03:49:27,829
All right.

2667
03:49:27,829 --> 03:49:31,079
Where's the hand right here?

2668
03:49:31,639 --> 03:50:07,569
Okay.

2669
03:50:15,239 --> 03:50:15,879
Now this.

2670
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:24,100
This is where we set up the blending options.

2671
03:50:24,739 --> 03:50:30,819
Here we go.

2672
03:50:30,819 --> 03:50:31,459
Edit shape.

2673
03:50:32,100 --> 03:50:33,680
That needs to be stamped.

2674
03:50:33,680 --> 03:50:34,879
It needs to be stamped.

2675
03:50:34,879 --> 03:50:37,940
It's this mirror.

2676
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:38,420
Back it up.

2677
03:50:43,159 --> 03:50:43,639
Stamp.

2678
03:50:44,930 --> 03:50:45,489
Okay.

2679
03:50:45,489 --> 03:50:50,000
Now I should be able to do weird shit with this nose.

2680
03:50:50,639 --> 03:50:59,000
Why not try to sculpt natural looking faces?

2681
03:50:59,559 --> 03:51:03,120
I mean because I'm trying to get used to the tools.

2682
03:51:03,840 --> 03:51:07,319
You want me to make like a natural looking face?

2683
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:12,680
I just figured out how to pan like yesterday.

2684
03:51:13,319 --> 03:51:22,959
Okay.

2685
03:51:22,959 --> 03:51:23,840
Blend amount.

2686
03:51:24,479 --> 03:51:29,190
Let's see what this does because now I should be able to.

2687
03:51:30,069 --> 03:51:31,729
Okay.

2688
03:51:31,729 --> 03:51:32,450
Let me see here.

2689
03:51:33,250 --> 03:51:37,639
Yeah.

2690
03:51:37,639 --> 03:51:38,120
Look at this.

2691
03:51:50,979 --> 03:51:51,459
Where is it?

2692
03:51:52,100 --> 03:52:01,569
He's got to come out a little further.

2693
03:52:01,569 --> 03:52:01,969
Hold on.

2694
03:52:19,190 --> 03:52:22,610
This is not what I thought was going to be here.

2695
03:52:28,040 --> 03:52:29,959
You can't even see this guy.

2696
03:52:31,219 --> 03:52:55,639
It's got to be much smaller.

2697
03:52:55,639 --> 03:52:56,040
There you go.

2698
03:52:56,040 --> 03:53:00,840
That's better because it's going to get squished into here.

2699
03:53:00,840 --> 03:53:12,709
Okay.

2700
03:53:12,709 --> 03:53:13,510
What does that look like?

2701
03:53:14,069 --> 03:53:19,729
That's not bad.

2702
03:53:34,870 --> 03:53:35,750
That's not a tongue.

2703
03:53:36,389 --> 03:53:38,479
This has to go down.

2704
03:53:43,350 --> 03:53:43,829
I'm going to have to.

2705
03:53:43,829 --> 03:53:44,149
Yeah.

2706
03:53:44,149 --> 03:53:45,590
This has to be changed.

2707
03:53:45,590 --> 03:53:53,860
I actually think I can do it like this.

2708
03:53:59,620 --> 03:54:00,899
That looks fine.

2709
03:54:00,899 --> 03:54:07,430
Okay.

2710
03:54:07,430 --> 03:54:08,790
Make nostrils.

2711
03:54:08,790 --> 03:54:12,469
Well, no, I can't make nostrils because the nostrils are both flat down.

2712
03:54:12,469 --> 03:54:14,069
Like sniffing the mountain.

2713
03:54:15,110 --> 03:54:27,889
Yeah.

2714
03:54:27,889 --> 03:54:28,530
He's going like.

2715
03:54:31,489 --> 03:54:32,129
I'm going to look.

2716
03:54:32,129 --> 03:54:32,690
I'll show you.

2717
03:54:33,250 --> 03:54:48,760
Let me let's I got to go back and finish this.

2718
03:54:49,479 --> 03:55:39,120
No.

2719
03:55:39,120 --> 03:55:41,680
His eyes are bugging out of his head and he's staring at the mountain.

2720
03:55:41,680 --> 03:55:55,399
What does this need to be?

2721
03:55:55,399 --> 03:55:56,549
Like that.

2722
03:55:56,549 --> 03:55:57,110
Down here.

2723
03:55:57,750 --> 03:56:13,909
A little bit more to the right.

2724
03:56:13,909 --> 03:56:14,629
Like over here.

2725
03:56:15,430 --> 03:56:19,350
Like that.

2726
03:56:19,909 --> 03:56:25,459
Okay.

2727
03:56:29,719 --> 03:56:30,680
Nose is here.

2728
03:56:31,399 --> 03:56:34,870
I mean, I could put the nostrils here.

2729
03:56:35,590 --> 03:56:36,850
You know.

2730
03:56:39,569 --> 03:56:40,209
What mouth?

2731
03:56:51,719 --> 03:56:52,120
Maybe.

2732
03:56:52,120 --> 03:56:53,559
Maybe have it like over here.

2733
03:56:53,559 --> 03:56:53,799
Yeah.

2734
03:56:54,600 --> 03:57:06,069
I don't hate it.

2735
03:57:06,069 --> 03:57:16,020
Let me just see.

2736
03:57:25,000 --> 03:57:25,879
He's taking a bite.

2737
03:57:25,879 --> 03:57:26,840
No, he's just going like.

2738
03:57:28,120 --> 03:57:34,579
All right.

2739
03:57:34,579 --> 03:57:37,459
That means I don't know what the fuck's going on over here.

2740
03:57:38,020 --> 03:57:42,610
I'm going to have to turn these guys, I think, a little and bring them down.

2741
03:57:48,950 --> 03:57:49,670
Hand.

2742
03:57:49,670 --> 03:57:55,010
All right.

2743
03:57:55,010 --> 03:57:58,180
Let's do the eyes.

2744
03:57:58,180 --> 03:57:58,979
Those are important.

2745
03:57:59,620 --> 03:58:04,579
Let's get right where we need to be.

2746
03:58:04,579 --> 03:58:05,540
Right here.

2747
03:58:11,200 --> 03:58:11,680
Excuse me.

2748
03:58:11,680 --> 03:58:12,559
What just happened?

2749
03:58:12,559 --> 03:58:13,360
What's going on here?

2750
03:58:14,799 --> 03:58:20,069
Oh, okay.

2751
03:58:20,069 --> 03:58:22,469
Let's get the paint tool.

2752
03:58:22,469 --> 03:58:23,110
Spray paint.

2753
03:58:24,069 --> 03:58:29,250
And let's scare the shit out of everybody that's here.

2754
03:58:39,379 --> 03:58:46,049
Because if you weren't concerned right now, you will be very soon.

2755
03:58:46,850 --> 03:59:13,239
Just be lower like this.

2756
03:59:17,569 --> 03:59:18,870
Okay.

2757
03:59:18,870 --> 03:59:20,149
Let's get some blue.

2758
03:59:20,149 --> 03:59:23,110
Or, I don't know, black.

2759
03:59:23,110 --> 03:59:51,399
Because eyeballs fade into the stalks.

2760
03:59:51,399 --> 03:59:54,579
Okay.

2761
04:00:01,159 --> 04:00:02,520
That eye is going to be pointed down.

2762
04:00:03,159 --> 04:00:05,719
Like down here.

2763
04:00:05,719 --> 04:00:10,100
Back it up.

2764
04:00:10,420 --> 04:00:11,799
Um, why am I?

2765
04:00:11,799 --> 04:00:12,520
What is going on?

2766
04:00:13,079 --> 04:00:15,350
I come back here.

2767
04:00:16,159 --> 04:00:16,799
Where are you going?

2768
04:00:17,440 --> 04:00:22,040
That needs to be, like, crazed.

2769
04:00:34,309 --> 04:00:35,270
Much better.

2770
04:00:35,270 --> 04:00:42,309
Okay.

2771
04:00:45,600 --> 04:00:46,159
I wonder.

2772
04:00:46,159 --> 04:00:50,079
Okay, so I'm not going to make him not flesh-colored.

2773
04:00:51,120 --> 04:00:53,360
He needs to be metal.

2774
04:00:57,379 --> 04:00:58,659
Let's make it fucking even weirder.

2775
04:01:15,829 --> 04:01:16,950
I don't think I can do that.

2776
04:01:16,950 --> 04:01:17,750
No, that's all right.

2777
04:01:17,750 --> 04:01:18,229
No, that's all right.

2778
04:01:18,229 --> 04:01:18,950
I can leave it as is.

2779
04:01:20,790 --> 04:01:22,229
Can we use eyebrows?

2780
04:01:22,229 --> 04:01:24,309
Yeah, I'll paint them on after.

2781
04:01:25,110 --> 04:01:27,120
Maybe it should just be a big guy.

2782
04:01:27,120 --> 04:01:28,479
Maybe it's just not even a robot.

2783
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:31,040
Although that would kind of break all the continuity.

2784
04:01:31,600 --> 04:01:33,040
Like there ever was one to begin with.

2785
04:01:37,459 --> 04:01:38,979
Give him more eyes.

2786
04:01:39,780 --> 04:01:40,280
No.

2787
04:01:40,899 --> 04:01:49,059
I got another three eyes pointing down.

2788
04:01:49,059 --> 04:01:50,899
Just not, not yet, not yet, not yet.

2789
04:01:50,899 --> 04:01:51,620
Hold on.

2790
04:01:51,620 --> 04:01:55,829
I need to figure out.

2791
04:01:55,829 --> 04:02:02,950
All right, so he's this kind of chrome, almost bronze.

2792
04:02:03,590 --> 04:02:07,700
Let's go in here.

2793
04:02:07,700 --> 04:02:17,489
Let's get that coat of almost like a bronze.

2794
04:02:18,209 --> 04:02:19,459
Like this.

2795
04:02:20,180 --> 04:02:37,719
I have the finish.

2796
04:02:50,879 --> 04:02:52,239
Now that's fucking crazy.

2797
04:02:52,879 --> 04:03:05,479
Maybe I might light him up a little bit.

2798
04:03:05,479 --> 04:03:06,600
Let's make, hold on.

2799
04:03:07,879 --> 04:03:13,250
Maybe like gold.

2800
04:03:13,809 --> 04:03:15,090
Yeah, this guy's going to be gold.

2801
04:03:15,889 --> 04:03:20,309
Oh no, his eyes.

2802
04:03:20,309 --> 04:03:21,270
I can fix them.

2803
04:03:21,270 --> 04:03:35,360
I'm not making you gold.

2804
04:03:36,079 --> 04:03:38,040
There we go.

2805
04:03:38,040 --> 04:03:57,639
All right, now let's do the finish again.

2806
04:03:58,360 --> 04:04:01,530
Okay.

2807
04:04:07,909 --> 04:04:09,909
I lost a little bit of the gold.

2808
04:04:09,909 --> 04:04:11,750
Maybe I should lighten him up to a little bit more.

2809
04:04:11,750 --> 04:04:12,549
Maybe that'll be better.

2810
04:04:14,020 --> 04:04:14,579
No.

2811
04:04:14,579 --> 04:04:17,319
I need like a brighter yellow.

2812
04:04:18,819 --> 04:04:19,780
He's not cheese.

2813
04:04:22,739 --> 04:04:24,420
Gold is like this.

2814
04:04:26,559 --> 04:04:28,239
But I don't know if I can get,

2815
04:04:28,239 --> 04:04:30,399
it might have to just be this kind of mustardy yellow.

2816
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:36,709
I'm going to save the color.

2817
04:04:48,840 --> 04:04:52,920
Just doesn't look the same.

2818
04:04:52,920 --> 04:04:53,959
Doesn't look right with the,

2819
04:04:54,680 --> 04:04:55,799
I guess that's close enough.

2820
04:05:04,239 --> 04:05:06,399
No, that's just, I think that because of the finish.

2821
04:05:08,819 --> 04:05:10,260
Let me remove some of the finish.

2822
04:05:10,979 --> 04:05:19,569
That's a, that's better.

2823
04:05:19,569 --> 04:05:21,010
All right, there's gold.

2824
04:05:22,290 --> 04:05:27,059
Now let's go back to the eyes.

2825
04:05:27,860 --> 04:05:34,280
And we'll make the eyes gold too.

2826
04:05:34,920 --> 04:05:45,239
Maybe I should make them like physical.

2827
04:05:50,479 --> 04:05:52,079
Oh yeah, absolutely.

2828
04:05:52,079 --> 04:06:13,889
Wait, what is it?

2829
04:06:13,889 --> 04:06:21,059
I was wondering why it looked like that.

2830
04:06:21,620 --> 04:06:23,969
It's because it's metal.

2831
04:06:23,969 --> 04:06:27,489
I don't want, let's just do default or plastic.

2832
04:06:27,489 --> 04:06:28,290
That's better, okay.

2833
04:06:49,270 --> 04:06:50,790
Fucking ice cream face.

2834
04:07:02,209 --> 04:07:04,209
Oh God.

2835
04:07:04,209 --> 04:07:06,049
Great Lord Walden just gave,

2836
04:07:06,049 --> 04:07:07,250
I think I'm going to spray paint it.

2837
04:07:07,250 --> 04:07:10,239
It just doesn't look right.

2838
04:07:10,239 --> 04:07:13,030
What are you doing?

2839
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:15,510
Great Lord Walden is just giving 20 community subs

2840
04:07:15,510 --> 04:07:16,549
over and over again.

2841
04:07:16,549 --> 04:07:18,020
Twice in a row.

2842
04:07:18,020 --> 04:07:19,139
Holy shit, dude.

2843
04:07:19,139 --> 04:07:26,979
Thank you for the 40 community subs.

2844
04:07:26,979 --> 04:07:28,340
Make it have eyelids.

2845
04:07:28,340 --> 04:07:31,059
And let me paint it for a sec,

2846
04:07:31,059 --> 04:07:33,139
but that's a lot of fucking subs, dude.

2847
04:07:33,139 --> 04:07:33,620
Thank you.

2848
04:07:35,159 --> 04:07:37,000
That's an insane amount of subs.

2849
04:07:37,000 --> 04:07:40,760
Get it back out.

2850
04:07:41,479 --> 04:07:44,760
How do you know when you get one?

2851
04:07:44,760 --> 04:07:46,040
Like as I look over and I see

2852
04:07:47,239 --> 04:07:48,680
it then blowing up in the chat.

2853
04:07:52,530 --> 04:07:53,569
Let's get the spray paint.

2854
04:07:57,139 --> 04:07:58,500
It's going to be easier to do it like this.

2855
04:08:03,030 --> 04:08:04,629
Circle, okay.

2856
04:08:04,629 --> 04:08:12,520
Reason why it's not showing up.

2857
04:08:13,079 --> 04:08:14,360
Any guesses?

2858
04:08:15,079 --> 04:08:16,899
Hmm.

2859
04:08:16,899 --> 04:08:22,100
I have it on paint can.

2860
04:08:22,979 --> 04:08:25,590
Hmm.

2861
04:08:26,229 --> 04:08:30,100
Why am I missing something here?

2862
04:08:30,100 --> 04:08:47,159
Maybe I need to just make it again.

2863
04:08:47,159 --> 04:08:48,440
Maybe I have to, let me see.

2864
04:08:50,739 --> 04:08:51,540
New sculpture?

2865
04:08:53,590 --> 04:08:54,709
No, it's just not coming up at all.

2866
04:08:55,510 --> 04:08:59,190
It's weird.

2867
04:09:00,790 --> 04:09:03,520
Maybe it's because I had the coat on already.

2868
04:09:05,159 --> 04:09:06,440
I'll just do it the way I had it before.

2869
04:09:20,399 --> 04:09:22,159
That's actually fucking horrifying.

2870
04:09:22,159 --> 04:09:22,959
So I'm going to keep it.

2871
04:09:42,719 --> 04:09:43,600
That was white, right?

2872
04:09:44,399 --> 04:09:54,950
Why do you look like that?

2873
04:09:55,670 --> 04:09:58,159
You're not metal.

2874
04:09:58,159 --> 04:10:05,440
Why are you doing this to me?

2875
04:10:09,799 --> 04:10:11,239
Well, oh, I got to move on.

2876
04:10:11,239 --> 04:10:12,040
I don't know what's going on.

2877
04:10:12,040 --> 04:10:13,399
I don't know why this is doing this.

2878
04:10:14,280 --> 04:10:18,309
I have no idea, but I got to move on.

2879
04:10:19,030 --> 04:10:49,959
God damn it.

2880
04:10:49,959 --> 04:10:50,920
All right, I got to pee.

2881
04:10:50,920 --> 04:10:52,520
This is driving me nuts.

2882
04:10:52,520 --> 04:10:53,239
I'll be right back.

2883
04:15:13,319 --> 04:15:13,639
Hey.

2884
04:15:18,360 --> 04:15:19,159
All right.

2885
04:15:19,159 --> 04:15:21,090
So what I'm going to do next,

2886
04:15:22,420 --> 04:15:23,700
I'm going to put a cap on this one.

2887
04:15:26,399 --> 04:15:27,520
Just kid this.

2888
04:15:27,520 --> 04:15:29,040
When I just came back, I just saw this.

2889
04:15:31,139 --> 04:15:32,420
I'm going to save this one

2890
04:15:32,420 --> 04:15:33,459
because I want to try something.

2891
04:15:36,420 --> 04:15:38,899
I want to try to mold my face.

2892
04:15:39,540 --> 04:15:53,110
I just want to see.

2893
04:15:59,379 --> 04:16:00,899
I want to just go make a guy

2894
04:16:00,899 --> 04:16:02,100
and walk around the world.

2895
04:16:12,120 --> 04:16:13,079
So pretty.

2896
04:16:18,709 --> 04:16:20,309
Mold my butt first.

2897
04:16:20,309 --> 04:16:21,750
I'm not going to mold my ass.

2898
04:16:22,469 --> 04:16:27,840
Just drop a puppet in.

2899
04:16:28,930 --> 04:16:30,049
Yeah, I wonder.

2900
04:16:30,049 --> 04:16:30,930
Let me see.

2901
04:16:30,930 --> 04:16:34,200
Let's go back to edit mode.

2902
04:16:34,760 --> 04:16:38,180
Yeah, let's drop a puppet in.

2903
04:16:41,110 --> 04:16:42,389
How do I do that?

2904
04:16:42,389 --> 04:16:44,389
Is it under guides, gadgets?

2905
04:16:45,510 --> 04:16:46,309
Gadgets, right?

2906
04:16:48,559 --> 04:16:49,360
Gameplay gear.

2907
04:16:51,010 --> 04:16:53,799
And it is one of these.

2908
04:16:53,799 --> 04:16:55,879
Blank puppet, blank puppet, puppet.

2909
04:16:55,879 --> 04:16:56,600
Yeah, one of these.

2910
04:16:57,399 --> 04:17:03,040
Don't step on the ice.

2911
04:17:03,040 --> 04:17:04,639
You can make like death zones too.

2912
04:17:07,540 --> 04:17:08,020
Here we go.

2913
04:17:15,729 --> 04:17:18,049
Well, the camera needs to be adjusted.

2914
04:17:18,049 --> 04:17:19,649
He's going way too fast.

2915
04:17:20,370 --> 04:17:25,639
There's no collision on those.

2916
04:17:25,639 --> 04:17:30,639
How do I adjust the camera?

2917
04:17:30,639 --> 04:17:36,209
Oh, go back to edit mode.

2918
04:17:36,209 --> 04:17:37,329
I want to like pull the camera in.

2919
04:17:41,139 --> 04:17:42,579
You have to be adjusted here.

2920
04:17:43,459 --> 04:17:45,219
Turn speed, movement speed.

2921
04:17:47,040 --> 04:17:48,239
It's way too fast.

2922
04:17:48,319 --> 04:17:50,079
Run speed, way too fast.

2923
04:17:52,420 --> 04:17:53,620
Okay, jump height.

2924
04:17:55,489 --> 04:17:57,010
I'm just realizing something right now.

2925
04:18:00,959 --> 04:18:02,479
I think this is very small.

2926
04:18:05,079 --> 04:18:08,360
This whole thing is only this big.

2927
04:18:11,780 --> 04:18:12,659
It's tiny.

2928
04:18:15,559 --> 04:18:18,120
It's very, very, very small.

2929
04:18:23,700 --> 04:18:26,440
Oops, I can scale it all up,

2930
04:18:26,440 --> 04:18:28,840
but I can scale everything down too.

2931
04:18:28,840 --> 04:18:29,959
That's the next part, right?

2932
04:18:32,040 --> 04:18:33,639
Okay, so now I want to...

2933
04:18:34,360 --> 04:18:38,239
Upper body, movement, behavior.

2934
04:18:38,959 --> 04:18:40,719
What is like camera?

2935
04:18:41,440 --> 04:18:45,719
I know that exists somewhere.

2936
04:18:50,180 --> 04:18:51,620
I've not done any of this yet.

2937
04:18:52,340 --> 04:18:58,469
Collision, labels, audio.

2938
04:19:00,610 --> 04:19:02,049
Yeah, you can make it first person.

2939
04:19:02,049 --> 04:19:04,049
It's just that I didn't do that.

2940
04:19:04,049 --> 04:19:06,209
I don't even know if the tutorials exist to do that.

2941
04:19:06,930 --> 04:19:10,850
That's something I would need to learn

2942
04:19:11,649 --> 04:19:14,340
kind of on my own time, I guess.

2943
04:19:14,979 --> 04:19:18,420
Because I don't know if there's any camera options.

2944
04:19:19,059 --> 04:19:26,120
But regardless, let's just stick around again.

2945
04:19:26,920 --> 04:19:34,639
That guy's so weird.

2946
04:19:36,079 --> 04:19:36,639
Oh, it's over here.

2947
04:19:37,680 --> 04:19:38,399
Nice trees.

2948
04:19:38,399 --> 04:19:39,520
Who made these trees?

2949
04:19:39,520 --> 04:19:40,479
These look pretty good.

2950
04:19:41,200 --> 04:19:53,620
I don't think I can make the jump over here through the ice.

2951
04:20:03,729 --> 04:20:04,610
Oops.

2952
04:20:04,610 --> 04:20:10,799
Oh, there you go.

2953
04:20:12,370 --> 04:20:16,049
This is the first actual real attempt I've really made.

2954
04:20:19,719 --> 04:20:20,840
Yeah, I can make the...

2955
04:20:20,840 --> 04:20:21,799
I can have collision under there.

2956
04:20:21,799 --> 04:20:23,239
But this was not supposed to be a game.

2957
04:20:23,239 --> 04:20:25,000
This was just me messing with the sculpting tool

2958
04:20:25,000 --> 04:20:26,040
and moving stuff around.

2959
04:20:31,040 --> 04:20:34,200
Yeah, now let's try something else.

2960
04:20:34,200 --> 04:20:35,809
I want to save this though.

2961
04:20:42,959 --> 04:20:48,049
Me, who cares?

2962
04:20:48,690 --> 04:20:58,739
Okay, so this has been saved.

2963
04:20:58,739 --> 04:20:59,379
Remix.

2964
04:21:02,629 --> 04:21:03,110
Save it.

2965
04:21:03,110 --> 04:21:03,750
It's saved.

2966
04:21:03,750 --> 04:21:04,549
Exit creation.

2967
04:21:06,370 --> 04:21:09,139
Okay, let me try this.

2968
04:21:09,139 --> 04:21:10,020
I want to just do this.

2969
04:21:10,659 --> 04:21:12,629
You can make like effects.

2970
04:21:13,350 --> 04:21:15,110
I could be sculptures and shit.

2971
04:21:15,110 --> 04:21:16,790
I don't even know how the hell you would do that.

2972
04:21:20,200 --> 04:21:21,159
Make a vehicle.

2973
04:21:23,299 --> 04:21:24,180
Make a song.

2974
04:21:26,920 --> 04:21:28,600
All right, music timeline.

2975
04:21:29,319 --> 04:21:33,430
It's got eight bars.

2976
04:21:33,430 --> 04:21:34,309
Let's drag it out.

2977
04:21:34,950 --> 04:21:38,180
Let's just go with like 16.

2978
04:21:40,770 --> 04:21:47,399
Okay, now I need search.

2979
04:21:49,059 --> 04:21:51,139
Search for music clips.

2980
04:21:56,790 --> 04:21:57,350
Animals.

2981
04:21:59,059 --> 04:21:59,860
No results.

2982
04:22:02,879 --> 04:22:03,600
Outer space.

2983
04:22:03,600 --> 04:22:04,559
What do you mean no results?

2984
04:22:05,200 --> 04:22:12,549
Collections.

2985
04:22:13,110 --> 04:22:16,399
What are you talking about?

2986
04:22:17,120 --> 04:22:28,209
So here's like media molecules little collection of clips.

2987
04:22:32,840 --> 04:22:33,799
Music tracks.

2988
04:22:33,799 --> 04:22:34,520
Music clips.

2989
04:22:35,159 --> 04:22:35,799
Start here.

2990
04:22:39,430 --> 04:22:39,909
Loops.

2991
04:22:40,709 --> 04:22:41,190
Drums.

2992
04:22:45,920 --> 04:22:46,799
Bass tracks.

2993
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:48,799
Chords.

2994
04:22:48,799 --> 04:22:49,680
Rhythm section.

2995
04:22:51,120 --> 04:22:52,319
Okay, let's do drums.

2996
04:23:00,600 --> 04:23:04,040
Popsicle break beat.

2997
04:23:04,600 --> 04:23:12,100
Whatever this is has to be played the whole time I sculpt my face.

2998
04:23:12,819 --> 04:23:17,159
I'm going to try to do every detail.

2999
04:23:17,799 --> 04:23:24,440
Popsicle.

3000
04:23:25,000 --> 04:23:27,079
Okay, we'll do popsicle.

3001
04:23:27,079 --> 04:23:38,799
Let's add.

3002
04:23:42,579 --> 04:23:43,620
Let's get back in here.

3003
04:23:48,559 --> 04:23:52,959
Hmm, we're back.

3004
04:23:52,959 --> 04:23:55,360
Let's go to chords.

3005
04:23:56,159 --> 04:24:05,239
Yeah, this really is just GarageBand.

3006
04:24:05,239 --> 04:24:06,760
You can make your own stuff.

3007
04:24:06,760 --> 04:24:08,040
I don't know how to do that yet though.

3008
04:24:08,760 --> 04:24:36,149
Hey, this doesn't suck.

3009
04:24:36,870 --> 04:24:43,719
All right, let's change.

3010
04:24:43,719 --> 04:24:44,680
Let's mess with this though.

3011
04:24:45,639 --> 04:24:48,129
So we got pitch.

3012
04:25:13,540 --> 04:25:15,940
Well, I didn't, I'm not adding this part.

3013
04:25:15,940 --> 04:25:17,219
What is doing that?

3014
04:25:17,219 --> 04:25:26,530
All right, well that sounds all right.

3015
04:25:26,530 --> 04:25:37,250
What else we got?

3016
04:25:37,250 --> 04:25:38,610
Distant traffic.

3017
04:25:38,610 --> 04:26:00,069
Okay, let's fade that out.

3018
04:26:01,030 --> 04:26:09,959
I'm putting the Bohemian Rhapsody sample.

3019
04:26:11,159 --> 04:26:16,500
This is the beginning.

3020
04:26:16,500 --> 04:26:21,620
Bang!

3021
04:26:21,620 --> 04:26:22,469
Right here.

3022
04:26:34,840 --> 04:26:36,040
Lightning strike.

3023
04:26:36,040 --> 04:26:39,809
I need to go search by categories.

3024
04:26:40,530 --> 04:26:42,100
Projectiles.

3025
04:26:44,159 --> 04:26:46,959
Crossbow.

3026
04:26:49,159 --> 04:26:50,979
Pew Blaster.

3027
04:26:51,940 --> 04:26:56,040
We need special effects.

3028
04:27:00,159 --> 04:27:08,260
Wait, you got it.

3029
04:27:12,790 --> 04:27:20,040
And then get the other one.

3030
04:27:21,639 --> 04:27:28,469
Oh my god, that was fucking long.

3031
04:27:29,350 --> 04:27:30,319
Which one of these?

3032
04:27:30,319 --> 04:27:31,280
This is the first explosion.

3033
04:27:31,280 --> 04:27:32,399
I don't want this part.

3034
04:27:32,399 --> 04:27:33,200
No, actually I do.

3035
04:27:34,319 --> 04:27:35,120
Just get in here.

3036
04:27:38,120 --> 04:27:39,079
Just, I just need one.

3037
04:27:51,600 --> 04:27:59,639
That's just too loud.

3038
04:28:15,829 --> 04:28:17,670
I don't know why that's so loud.

3039
04:28:17,670 --> 04:28:26,559
Playback speed.

3040
04:28:26,559 --> 04:28:28,559
Like, does it have to be that loud?

3041
04:28:29,120 --> 04:28:34,159
And this is only going to happen for like a second, right?

3042
04:28:39,809 --> 04:28:41,250
Can I put the timeline here?

3043
04:28:41,250 --> 04:28:43,750
Yeah, I want to play from here.

3044
04:28:44,389 --> 04:29:04,440
Okay, now let's go back here.

3045
04:29:05,159 --> 04:29:06,760
Can you do your own voice?

3046
04:29:06,760 --> 04:29:07,719
Yes, you can.

3047
04:29:07,719 --> 04:29:17,090
I need like a heavy guitar.

3048
04:29:17,649 --> 04:29:25,569
Go back to the main menu here.

3049
04:29:28,899 --> 04:29:33,319
I need this most recent, no, tags.

3050
04:29:34,899 --> 04:29:35,540
Animals.

3051
04:29:36,659 --> 04:29:37,700
Starting point.

3052
04:29:37,700 --> 04:29:39,459
Phases, phrases and loops.

3053
04:29:39,459 --> 04:29:39,860
Track.

3054
04:29:40,899 --> 04:29:44,020
It just turns into Africa.

3055
04:29:50,260 --> 04:29:52,180
I think this is kind of broken right now.

3056
04:29:52,819 --> 04:29:57,860
Collections.

3057
04:29:58,420 --> 04:30:09,510
Because if I go to all, I want to do categories.

3058
04:30:10,229 --> 04:30:11,639
Category music.

3059
04:30:12,440 --> 04:30:12,920
Tag.

3060
04:30:12,920 --> 04:30:13,879
Tags A to Z.

3061
04:30:15,090 --> 04:30:17,729
Blues, animals, classical, like classical.

3062
04:30:18,469 --> 04:30:18,969
Okay.

3063
04:30:20,500 --> 04:30:22,500
Dance, country, it was like rock.

3064
04:30:23,840 --> 04:30:24,399
Heavy metal.

3065
04:30:25,350 --> 04:30:25,829
There we go.

3066
04:30:30,799 --> 04:30:31,920
Turn the game volume back up.

3067
04:30:34,239 --> 04:30:44,450
I like it.

3068
04:30:45,090 --> 04:30:48,440
Let's see.

3069
04:31:08,959 --> 04:31:09,600
What?

3070
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:11,200
I don't know why it has to be that loud.

3071
04:31:15,010 --> 04:31:16,450
No, no, no, no, back, back, back, back, back, back.

3072
04:31:22,719 --> 04:31:23,520
What does this sound like?

3073
04:31:23,520 --> 04:31:25,120
Why can't I want to play it from here?

3074
04:31:25,920 --> 04:31:58,879
Why is there a dial tone?

3075
04:31:58,879 --> 04:31:59,360
I don't know.

3076
04:31:59,360 --> 04:32:01,360
I'm just putting stuff in just to see.

3077
04:32:01,360 --> 04:32:02,399
I haven't played with this yet.

3078
04:32:02,959 --> 04:32:23,600
The perfect theme song for Jerma Popsicle.

3079
04:32:32,049 --> 04:32:33,729
I don't want this to go all the way.

3080
04:32:33,729 --> 04:32:42,959
These really aren't supposed to be.

3081
04:32:42,959 --> 04:32:46,159
Unless you have a real idea where you're going to make your own song.

3082
04:32:47,200 --> 04:32:52,959
I don't know if more than 16 bars, 24 bars of a loop is a good idea.

3083
04:33:17,319 --> 04:33:19,159
You really need to come in and make your own stuff.

3084
04:33:19,880 --> 04:33:22,869
But I don't really know how to do that yet.

3085
04:33:23,189 --> 04:33:25,970
I don't know how to play around with the timeline, but nothing else.

3086
04:33:26,770 --> 04:33:35,959
All right, let's sculpt my face.

3087
04:33:36,680 --> 04:33:38,360
I'm not going to do music.

3088
04:33:38,360 --> 04:33:40,599
It'll take all day and I don't know how to do it.

3089
04:33:40,599 --> 04:33:41,799
So we're not going to do it.

3090
04:33:47,680 --> 04:33:49,680
So here's what we're going to do.

3091
04:33:50,319 --> 04:33:54,439
That sounds like 2013 Garage Band.

3092
04:33:55,319 --> 04:33:58,360
Yeah, it's probably very similar.

3093
04:33:58,919 --> 04:34:04,919
So here's what we're just going to put on something easy.

3094
04:34:10,580 --> 04:34:11,299
There, there you go.

3095
04:34:12,419 --> 04:34:18,470
So I'm going to try as hard as I can.

3096
04:34:19,349 --> 04:34:20,930
Let's see if I can do it.

3097
04:34:26,290 --> 04:34:27,810
I'm going to try to sculpt my face.

3098
04:34:29,279 --> 04:34:30,240
At least the front part.

3099
04:34:33,220 --> 04:34:35,299
I'm not going to put the explosion on loop.

3100
04:34:39,319 --> 04:34:40,759
I don't even know what camera this is.

3101
04:34:41,319 --> 04:34:43,159
Is this the right camera?

3102
04:34:43,159 --> 04:34:46,759
Let's find out.

3103
04:34:46,759 --> 04:34:47,159
It is.

3104
04:34:55,279 --> 04:34:57,520
So I'm going to just take a screenshot of my face

3105
04:34:58,240 --> 04:35:03,119
and I'm going to try to get it correct.

3106
04:35:03,119 --> 04:35:09,840
So there we go.

3107
04:35:10,560 --> 04:35:23,409
Let me change this and it should show up now.

3108
04:35:28,130 --> 04:35:30,130
Just want a little screenshot.

3109
04:35:35,509 --> 04:35:37,029
Yeah, we'll do the beard too.

3110
04:35:37,590 --> 04:35:43,400
Okay, ready?

3111
04:36:00,080 --> 04:36:01,200
I can't take it.

3112
04:36:01,200 --> 04:36:02,319
How am I supposed to take it?

3113
04:36:02,319 --> 04:36:06,229
Okay, ready?

3114
04:36:06,229 --> 04:36:07,599
I got an idea.

3115
04:36:07,599 --> 04:36:18,740
Okay, got the screenshot.

3116
04:36:20,180 --> 04:36:21,459
Get a profile shot too.

3117
04:36:26,130 --> 04:36:27,090
Hold on, hold on.

3118
04:36:27,090 --> 04:36:29,569
I can't do all that at once.

3119
04:36:36,229 --> 04:36:37,189
Is it out of sync?

3120
04:36:37,189 --> 04:36:38,799
Hold on.

3121
04:36:38,799 --> 04:36:40,479
Let me get the first screenshot.

3122
04:36:40,479 --> 04:36:52,290
I'm going to do this first.

3123
04:36:52,290 --> 04:36:53,409
Like it's going to be so much easier

3124
04:36:53,409 --> 04:36:54,610
if I get my other monitor back.

3125
04:37:04,310 --> 04:37:06,150
Oh my God, you piece of shit.

3126
04:37:06,869 --> 04:37:12,709
I don't ever buy a monitor

3127
04:37:12,709 --> 04:37:14,470
that has a fucking touch pad on the right.

3128
04:37:15,029 --> 04:37:16,310
It's a piece of crap.

3129
04:37:17,270 --> 04:37:19,590
Like it's a piece of total crap.

3130
04:37:19,590 --> 04:37:24,610
All right, this is a...

3131
04:37:31,380 --> 04:37:35,240
I don't even look like a real person.

3132
04:37:35,240 --> 04:37:54,520
All right, hold on.

3133
04:37:54,520 --> 04:37:55,159
Save that.

3134
04:37:55,720 --> 04:38:08,400
Oh my God.

3135
04:38:08,400 --> 04:38:17,669
I hate computers more than anything.

3136
04:38:17,669 --> 04:38:18,310
Save that.

3137
04:38:28,709 --> 04:38:30,389
I bet you I could probably get it pretty close

3138
04:38:30,389 --> 04:38:38,000
and then this side too.

3139
04:38:38,000 --> 04:39:12,930
I need to bring this over here.

3140
04:39:12,930 --> 04:39:23,880
Okay, I got it.

3141
04:39:23,880 --> 04:39:24,680
Wait, what?

3142
04:39:24,680 --> 04:39:32,610
Why is it a different image?

3143
04:39:32,610 --> 04:39:34,610
It's taking a screenshot of every,

3144
04:39:34,610 --> 04:39:37,009
of all three of my monitors.

3145
04:39:37,009 --> 04:39:49,810
Oh my, hurry the fuck up.

3146
04:39:53,189 --> 04:39:54,069
What are you doing?

3147
04:39:54,630 --> 04:39:58,229
I hate computers.

3148
04:39:58,229 --> 04:39:59,830
I can't wait till we go back to fucking newspapers.

3149
04:39:59,830 --> 04:40:04,479
I swear to God.

3150
04:40:04,479 --> 04:40:06,080
All right, I'm gone.

3151
04:40:06,080 --> 04:40:10,560
I'll be back.

3152
04:40:10,560 --> 04:40:11,840
I got to add the zits too.

3153
04:40:11,840 --> 04:40:12,880
There's like two zits.

3154
04:40:12,880 --> 04:40:35,220
All right, let's get them on screen.

3155
04:40:35,220 --> 04:40:36,900
When it looks like lit up better.

3156
04:40:36,900 --> 04:40:51,240
Okay, so that's what I'm going for.

3157
04:40:51,240 --> 04:40:55,650
I need these references like on my screen.

3158
04:40:55,650 --> 04:41:07,090
I'm going to put it down here.

3159
04:41:07,090 --> 04:41:08,049
That's for you.

3160
04:41:08,049 --> 04:41:16,900
It's your super face cam.

3161
04:41:29,959 --> 04:41:31,000
Make them kiss.

3162
04:41:33,509 --> 04:41:35,189
So now I also...

3163
04:41:35,750 --> 04:41:40,930
Bear with me here.

3164
04:41:40,930 --> 04:41:42,770
Those are three different people.

3165
04:41:46,319 --> 04:41:46,959
They are not.

3166
04:41:46,959 --> 04:41:57,060
I can assure you.

3167
04:41:57,060 --> 04:41:58,180
Now I get them over here.

3168
04:41:58,180 --> 04:42:02,369
All right, here we go.

3169
04:42:02,369 --> 04:42:04,290
Let's see how close I can get this.

3170
04:42:04,290 --> 04:42:09,880
I'll spend four hours on this.

3171
04:42:09,880 --> 04:42:11,000
I could care less.

3172
04:42:11,000 --> 04:42:17,860
All right, time to begin.

3173
04:42:17,860 --> 04:42:19,880
So we're going to start with...

3174
04:42:21,159 --> 04:42:22,680
We're going to go with the front.

3175
04:42:22,680 --> 04:42:42,209
Okay, so we have to go with the circle.

3176
04:42:42,930 --> 04:42:43,970
Or maybe like the cone.

3177
04:42:44,610 --> 04:42:50,360
It's probably cone.

3178
04:42:50,360 --> 04:43:15,959
No, no.

3179
04:43:23,799 --> 04:43:25,639
So let's start with the forehead.

3180
04:43:25,639 --> 04:43:34,849
And then it comes down here.

3181
04:43:35,650 --> 04:43:36,770
I just need like a base.

3182
04:44:01,189 --> 04:44:03,959
I don't think I can fucking do this.

3183
04:44:03,959 --> 04:44:05,560
I need like a base first.

3184
04:44:11,619 --> 04:44:12,340
To do this correctly,

3185
04:44:12,340 --> 04:44:14,419
it's going to take like 50 hours.

3186
04:44:14,419 --> 04:44:22,159
This is like an actual art project.

3187
04:44:22,159 --> 04:44:33,669
There you go, done.

3188
04:44:35,759 --> 04:44:36,709
Who is that?

3189
04:44:36,709 --> 04:44:37,189
No, no.

3190
04:44:37,189 --> 04:44:38,470
What character is this?

3191
04:44:38,470 --> 04:44:40,680
It's a cookie character or something.

3192
04:44:40,680 --> 04:44:41,720
What's the character?

3193
04:44:41,720 --> 04:44:43,000
There's his mouth right there.

3194
04:44:43,000 --> 04:44:43,720
This is eyes.

3195
04:44:43,720 --> 04:44:46,069
Who is this?

3196
04:44:46,069 --> 04:44:46,630
Oh my God.

3197
04:44:46,630 --> 04:45:05,729
It's like a fucking serial character.

3198
04:45:05,729 --> 04:45:07,810
This and then let's shave off.

3199
04:45:07,810 --> 04:45:13,319
Let's get in there.

3200
04:45:13,319 --> 04:45:20,069
What are you doing?

3201
04:45:24,610 --> 04:45:25,490
That was weird.

3202
04:45:25,490 --> 04:45:28,580
Why does it look so weird here?

3203
04:45:28,580 --> 04:45:34,180
All right, let me see what we got.

3204
04:45:34,740 --> 04:45:44,659
Does this part stays up a little?

3205
04:45:45,459 --> 04:45:59,669
Is that the mouth?

3206
04:45:59,669 --> 04:45:59,990
No, no, no.

3207
04:45:59,990 --> 04:46:01,110
This is like the side of the head.

3208
04:46:04,979 --> 04:46:06,259
This is not the nose.

3209
04:46:06,900 --> 04:46:15,090
I just need to get like the general shape.

3210
04:46:15,090 --> 04:46:29,409
Once I just get...

3211
04:46:29,409 --> 04:46:31,009
Let me just like get off the edges here.

3212
04:46:31,650 --> 04:46:36,610
I think I may have made it too big.

3213
04:46:36,610 --> 04:46:39,830
All these controls are killing me.

3214
04:46:43,349 --> 04:47:13,220
This comes in like this.

3215
04:47:14,500 --> 04:47:29,840
Circle's not going to work.

3216
04:47:32,880 --> 04:47:33,680
It's all right.

3217
04:47:33,680 --> 04:47:35,110
I'm doing it.

3218
04:47:35,110 --> 04:47:35,990
I've already started.

3219
04:47:35,990 --> 04:47:36,229
I don't know.

3220
04:47:36,229 --> 04:47:37,189
It's not going back now.

3221
04:47:43,200 --> 04:47:44,000
Maybe the side.

3222
04:47:44,000 --> 04:47:44,560
Oh my God.

3223
04:47:44,560 --> 04:47:46,560
This is going to take forever.

3224
04:47:46,560 --> 04:48:05,159
This is going to actually take forever.

3225
04:48:05,159 --> 04:48:06,040
I know I can do this.

3226
04:48:06,040 --> 04:48:06,919
Where's mirror?

3227
04:48:06,919 --> 04:48:09,270
Okay, there it is.

3228
04:48:09,270 --> 04:48:13,240
I believe I can do it on both sides.

3229
04:48:13,240 --> 04:48:13,799
There we go.

3230
04:48:13,799 --> 04:48:17,680
Okay, zoom out.

3231
04:48:17,680 --> 04:48:35,279
It's getting there.

3232
04:48:35,279 --> 04:48:53,299
I wish I could just see it all.

3233
04:48:53,299 --> 04:48:56,759
I don't want to like have an axis of it.

3234
04:48:56,759 --> 04:48:58,919
I want to like see it the whole thing

3235
04:48:58,919 --> 04:48:59,639
and be able to do it

3236
04:48:59,639 --> 04:49:01,720
and not have to move the fucking camera around.

3237
04:49:03,599 --> 04:49:08,209
I want to stay here.

3238
04:49:08,209 --> 04:49:10,340
I don't want to move in.

3239
04:49:10,979 --> 04:49:15,479
That's like the biggest gripe I have with the game.

3240
04:49:16,040 --> 04:49:21,110
I would love to just lock the camera here

3241
04:49:21,110 --> 04:49:22,069
and like be able to move around

3242
04:49:22,069 --> 04:49:23,430
and sculpt from here.

3243
04:49:23,430 --> 04:49:24,549
No, I have to move forward.

3244
04:49:33,700 --> 04:49:35,139
I can't like lock the camera.

3245
04:49:42,819 --> 04:49:43,459
I don't think there was anything

3246
04:49:43,459 --> 04:49:44,500
in the tutorials talking about

3247
04:49:44,500 --> 04:49:46,020
to lock the camera in place.

3248
04:49:46,819 --> 04:49:51,830
Well, let's just keep going like this.

3249
04:49:52,709 --> 04:49:57,799
Just do it in Blender.

3250
04:49:57,799 --> 04:49:58,360
It's free.

3251
04:50:00,040 --> 04:50:03,000
It probably would be easier to do this in Blender.

3252
04:50:07,400 --> 04:50:09,400
Look, I know I can hold R1

3253
04:50:09,400 --> 04:50:11,159
and rotate all over the place,

3254
04:50:11,159 --> 04:50:12,599
but I can't paint like this.

3255
04:50:13,240 --> 04:50:14,040
I can't do anything.

3256
04:50:18,389 --> 04:50:19,830
I have to move forward.

3257
04:50:20,959 --> 04:50:25,159
It's just really odd.

3258
04:50:25,159 --> 04:50:27,000
The fact that the camera moves with you

3259
04:50:27,000 --> 04:50:29,959
while you move to sculpt

3260
04:50:29,959 --> 04:50:31,720
is just very, very odd

3261
04:50:31,720 --> 04:50:32,599
that they would do that.

3262
04:50:33,240 --> 04:50:35,360
But it doesn't move backwards.

3263
04:50:35,840 --> 04:50:44,709
All right, we're getting there.

3264
04:50:44,709 --> 04:50:45,830
These are correct.

3265
04:50:45,830 --> 04:51:18,119
I just want to lock the camera.

3266
04:51:18,680 --> 04:51:19,479
That's all I want to do.

3267
04:51:20,119 --> 04:51:37,430
Okay, I must get the initial shape.

3268
04:51:52,310 --> 04:51:53,750
This has got to go back here though.

3269
04:51:54,389 --> 04:52:07,810
I'm just turning it into a bike helmet.

3270
04:52:07,810 --> 04:52:26,959
Okay, so let me go up.

3271
04:52:26,959 --> 04:52:28,080
No, no, not up.

3272
04:52:28,080 --> 04:52:29,590
I need to keep these here.

3273
04:52:29,590 --> 04:52:36,470
This has to be changed though.

3274
04:52:37,430 --> 04:52:44,610
Let's go square back here.

3275
04:52:44,610 --> 04:52:58,119
Just remember, don't do it wrong.

3276
04:52:59,319 --> 04:53:00,360
What do you mean don't do it wrong?

3277
04:53:10,470 --> 04:53:13,880
This is immensely difficult to control.

3278
04:53:17,939 --> 04:53:19,139
Dude, you know what?

3279
04:53:19,139 --> 04:53:21,750
Does it really have to be motion controlled?

3280
04:53:23,680 --> 04:53:24,560
I heard somebody said

3281
04:53:24,560 --> 04:53:26,479
that they were making a non-motion

3282
04:53:26,479 --> 04:53:28,000
controlled part of the game.

3283
04:53:28,000 --> 04:53:31,110
Like, can I just turn this off?

3284
04:53:31,110 --> 04:53:32,229
I don't want this.

3285
04:53:32,229 --> 04:53:47,060
I don't want this.

3286
04:53:47,939 --> 04:53:50,130
They're adding control methods.

3287
04:53:50,130 --> 04:53:50,689
Thank God.

3288
04:53:53,909 --> 04:53:55,509
A sculpting general grievous.

3289
04:53:55,509 --> 04:53:57,110
It's just hard to get anything.

3290
04:53:57,110 --> 04:54:27,479
I'm just, ah, it's,

3291
04:54:27,479 --> 04:54:30,040
I'm almost ready to start doing details.

3292
04:54:30,040 --> 04:54:52,560
Look at the side of my face.

3293
04:54:52,560 --> 04:54:54,479
How am I ever going to fix this?

3294
04:54:56,580 --> 04:55:01,459
I'm going to look like a fucking imbecile.

3295
04:55:01,459 --> 04:55:04,819
I'm going to look like a, like an alien race.

3296
04:55:33,840 --> 04:55:35,200
That's close enough.

3297
04:55:42,919 --> 04:55:46,099
Let's see what's in front.

3298
04:55:46,099 --> 04:55:47,860
All I care about is the front and the sides.

3299
04:55:51,779 --> 04:55:54,000
Take this in.

3300
04:56:02,099 --> 04:56:04,099
No, I don't have, this is like turkey neck.

3301
04:56:14,759 --> 04:56:16,369
Okay.

3302
04:56:16,369 --> 04:56:17,590
All right.

3303
04:56:17,590 --> 04:56:19,509
I'm ready to start doing,

3304
04:56:19,509 --> 04:56:20,869
get rid of the mirror.

3305
04:56:20,869 --> 04:56:28,400
What does my face look like?

3306
04:56:28,400 --> 04:56:28,799
Let's see.

3307
04:56:29,439 --> 04:56:31,919
I'm going to start bottom to top.

3308
04:56:31,919 --> 04:56:37,779
Let's see.

3309
04:56:37,779 --> 04:56:38,900
I need the cylinder.

3310
04:56:39,540 --> 04:56:41,520
I have it on.

3311
04:56:42,080 --> 04:56:43,029
Okay.

3312
04:56:43,029 --> 04:56:43,909
Here we go.

3313
04:56:43,909 --> 04:56:53,459
I need to do surface mode and blending, right?

3314
04:56:53,459 --> 04:56:57,560
Oh, it's no, no, no, no.

3315
04:56:57,560 --> 04:56:58,119
Not blending.

3316
04:57:02,389 --> 04:57:04,389
So this, my nose, where's my mouth?

3317
04:57:05,110 --> 04:57:15,000
It starts like this.

3318
04:57:15,880 --> 04:58:06,099
I need to go.

3319
04:58:07,060 --> 04:58:07,299
All right.

3320
04:58:07,299 --> 04:58:09,380
So then what's supposed to measure it from here?

3321
04:58:10,340 --> 04:58:11,540
It's like up here.

3322
04:58:11,540 --> 04:58:13,139
And this is where the nose starts.

3323
04:58:16,159 --> 04:58:17,919
Right there, like right here, actually.

3324
04:58:32,680 --> 04:58:37,200
And then it's still a little bit like a bulb this way.

3325
04:58:40,240 --> 04:58:53,360
It's a little thicker up here.

3326
04:59:04,020 --> 04:59:06,979
It's like two people playing volleyball.

3327
04:59:47,720 --> 04:59:49,639
I need to get it right from this side.

3328
04:59:50,439 --> 04:59:53,860
This is a fucked up.

3329
04:59:53,860 --> 04:59:55,299
This is not even close.

3330
04:59:55,619 --> 05:00:02,419
Looks like somebody took their hand and smashed it into my face.

3331
05:00:02,419 --> 05:00:05,139
They just bombed me straight in, squished.

3332
05:00:15,220 --> 05:00:16,259
Oh, man.

3333
05:00:16,259 --> 05:00:17,299
No fucking way.

3334
05:00:26,450 --> 05:00:27,650
It gets wider here.

3335
05:00:28,450 --> 05:00:33,349
Look at this.

3336
05:00:33,909 --> 05:00:39,959
Okay.

3337
05:00:39,959 --> 05:00:40,919
Let me look over here.

3338
05:00:41,720 --> 05:00:44,709
It's kind of flat right here.

3339
05:00:56,310 --> 05:00:58,709
No, this is like just growths all over my nose.

3340
05:01:12,150 --> 05:01:15,599
Okay.

3341
05:01:17,909 --> 05:01:18,310
Eyes.

3342
05:01:19,029 --> 05:01:19,590
But hold on.

3343
05:01:19,590 --> 05:01:20,869
I have some like dips here.

3344
05:01:21,750 --> 05:01:22,869
No, that's not going to happen.

3345
05:01:23,430 --> 05:01:30,150
So let me see what the eyes look like.

3346
05:01:30,790 --> 05:01:35,360
Go.

3347
05:01:35,360 --> 05:01:38,119
How close are they?

3348
05:01:38,119 --> 05:01:39,400
This one's kind of close to my nose.

3349
05:01:40,040 --> 05:01:48,560
This one's a little further away like this.

3350
05:01:49,840 --> 05:02:05,799
Okay.

3351
05:02:05,799 --> 05:02:19,509
And then I have like kind of a big brow bone that sticks out.

3352
05:02:22,610 --> 05:02:22,930
This.

3353
05:02:23,650 --> 05:03:01,639
I'll get this end here.

3354
05:03:02,599 --> 05:03:06,279
And it kind of comes down like this, but they don't connect.

3355
05:03:07,159 --> 05:03:13,880
And then the forehead.

3356
05:03:13,880 --> 05:03:15,240
My forehead's a little longer than this.

3357
05:03:15,880 --> 05:03:18,319
I can't add to it though.

3358
05:03:18,880 --> 05:03:35,669
Let me check over here.

3359
05:03:35,669 --> 05:03:36,790
I want it to go like this.

3360
05:03:37,909 --> 05:03:45,650
Back this up.

3361
05:03:46,209 --> 05:03:48,159
Let's take all this out.

3362
05:03:48,159 --> 05:03:48,959
It doesn't need to be here.

3363
05:03:49,759 --> 05:04:03,939
Oh, God.

3364
05:04:04,979 --> 05:04:06,950
Don't cut the whole thing off.

3365
05:04:07,590 --> 05:04:09,959
All right.

3366
05:04:09,959 --> 05:04:11,720
I have to add the hair, so don't worry.

3367
05:04:21,270 --> 05:04:23,110
I'm just like a moon face.

3368
05:04:29,889 --> 05:04:30,770
Oh, well.

3369
05:04:30,770 --> 05:04:54,400
All right.

3370
05:04:54,400 --> 05:04:54,959
Getting better.

3371
05:04:57,759 --> 05:04:58,560
My internet design?

3372
05:04:59,200 --> 05:05:02,020
My internet's going fucking crazy, huh?

3373
05:05:09,459 --> 05:05:10,099
New emote?

3374
05:05:10,099 --> 05:05:10,580
Not yet.

3375
05:05:12,069 --> 05:05:13,990
Am I going to stream here or what's going on?

3376
05:05:13,990 --> 05:05:15,750
Dropped like 15,000 frames.

3377
05:05:15,750 --> 05:05:23,279
What the fuck is going on?

3378
05:05:32,119 --> 05:05:33,159
Shave this part off.

3379
05:05:49,520 --> 05:05:52,080
I can cover this with hair, so I'm not concerned about that.

3380
05:05:53,509 --> 05:05:55,029
Question is, is this correct?

3381
05:05:58,000 --> 05:05:58,560
Not really.

3382
05:06:01,250 --> 05:06:01,490
No.

3383
05:06:02,290 --> 05:06:08,630
Give a goddamn camera.

3384
05:06:09,349 --> 05:06:27,240
Let me go in here.

3385
05:06:27,240 --> 05:06:34,720
The mouth is wrong to try to fix this.

3386
05:06:35,279 --> 05:06:50,770
I have a big bottom lip.

3387
05:07:03,240 --> 05:07:20,040
Somebody put some indents on my face.

3388
05:07:20,599 --> 05:07:22,279
Let me just patch those up real quick.

3389
05:07:23,639 --> 05:07:38,770
The nose is way too far away from my mouth, and the eyes are not correct.

3390
05:07:38,770 --> 05:07:41,639
But I think we can move on.

3391
05:07:46,880 --> 05:07:47,840
The nostrils are there.

3392
05:07:48,479 --> 05:07:51,650
I need to go back here.

3393
05:07:52,450 --> 05:07:57,319
All right.

3394
05:07:57,319 --> 05:07:58,520
I need to do paint.

3395
05:07:59,560 --> 05:08:00,880
Go to tint.

3396
05:08:01,919 --> 05:08:04,479
That is kind of my skin right now.

3397
05:08:05,040 --> 05:08:07,080
I don't think I need to change that.

3398
05:08:19,959 --> 05:08:20,840
Just spray paint?

3399
05:08:20,840 --> 05:08:21,240
No, no, no.

3400
05:08:21,240 --> 05:08:21,720
It's got to be...

3401
05:08:24,639 --> 05:08:29,299
Well, let's go to the paint tool.

3402
05:08:30,259 --> 05:08:35,400
Let's grab this one.

3403
05:08:36,279 --> 05:08:37,080
How does that look?

3404
05:08:37,080 --> 05:08:37,400
No.

3405
05:08:37,400 --> 05:08:38,680
These would be like the veiny one.

3406
05:08:43,939 --> 05:08:45,139
Even worse than that.

3407
05:08:45,939 --> 05:08:46,580
Worse than that.

3408
05:08:47,220 --> 05:08:52,790
What's my beard look like?

3409
05:08:52,790 --> 05:08:54,150
It's really stringy and terrible.

3410
05:08:55,110 --> 05:09:02,159
No, not like that.

3411
05:09:02,159 --> 05:09:05,270
I'll probably just go with veins.

3412
05:09:05,270 --> 05:09:08,470
And then the color is dark brown.

3413
05:09:09,110 --> 05:09:18,279
Okay, and snap that.

3414
05:09:20,880 --> 05:09:24,360
Oh my god.

3415
05:09:32,180 --> 05:09:32,500
Okay.

3416
05:10:13,380 --> 05:10:15,459
It's like that.

3417
05:10:15,459 --> 05:10:16,259
No, it's not.

3418
05:10:19,729 --> 05:10:21,810
This is not like glued on a hair.

3419
05:10:41,430 --> 05:10:42,950
Wait, what happened here?

3420
05:10:42,950 --> 05:11:00,180
Oh, should I need to side?

3421
05:11:00,180 --> 05:11:00,740
No, no, no.

3422
05:11:00,740 --> 05:11:14,240
Not yet, not yet.

3423
05:11:14,240 --> 05:11:15,680
This does look like my beard.

3424
05:11:15,680 --> 05:11:19,650
It looks terrible.

3425
05:11:19,650 --> 05:11:20,450
Okay.

3426
05:11:20,450 --> 05:11:27,970
And you didn't think that looked like my beard?

3427
05:11:27,970 --> 05:11:43,750
Come on now.

3428
05:11:43,750 --> 05:11:45,509
Cox is trying to kill the stream.

3429
05:11:47,840 --> 05:11:49,520
Yeah, they do that, don't they?

3430
05:11:50,000 --> 05:12:00,020
Let's put the eyes in.

3431
05:12:00,020 --> 05:12:07,569
I can do the hair too.

3432
05:12:07,569 --> 05:12:07,889
Paint.

3433
05:12:08,930 --> 05:12:10,290
Hair, I'm going to say, would be...

3434
05:12:12,709 --> 05:12:13,669
I know how it looks.

3435
05:12:14,310 --> 05:12:16,279
Probably expressive.

3436
05:12:18,130 --> 05:12:19,490
Yeah, it's definitely going to be expressive.

3437
05:12:20,049 --> 05:12:20,770
Same color too.

3438
05:12:21,330 --> 05:12:42,549
Okay, so this swoops down over here.

3439
05:12:43,110 --> 05:12:49,639
It goes around here.

3440
05:13:07,090 --> 05:13:07,650
What's happening?

3441
05:13:07,650 --> 05:13:12,290
What do you mean?

3442
05:13:12,290 --> 05:13:13,889
My hairline is not higher than this?

3443
05:13:13,889 --> 05:13:15,540
What are you talking about?

3444
05:13:15,540 --> 05:13:17,619
It's already awful.

3445
05:13:17,619 --> 05:13:18,900
It's already so bad.

3446
05:13:32,560 --> 05:13:33,439
Friar tuck.

3447
05:13:35,349 --> 05:13:36,599
Hold on.

3448
05:13:54,389 --> 05:13:56,310
You look like a stooge.

3449
05:13:56,310 --> 05:14:02,529
Just let me get it all on there before anybody makes fun of me.

3450
05:14:05,060 --> 05:14:05,860
I'm going to comb it.

3451
05:14:13,720 --> 05:14:15,319
I have to comb it first.

3452
05:14:15,319 --> 05:14:25,349
Which side does it go down?

3453
05:14:25,349 --> 05:14:25,909
Not that one.

3454
05:14:26,630 --> 05:14:27,110
This one.

3455
05:15:01,380 --> 05:15:38,610
I'm going to try to comb this and we'll see what happens.

3456
05:15:44,639 --> 05:15:47,520
German looking low-key cute in this image here.

3457
05:15:47,520 --> 05:15:47,840
Thanks.

3458
05:15:47,840 --> 05:15:48,560
I appreciate that.

3459
05:16:03,000 --> 05:16:11,639
I don't think this is going to work.

3460
05:16:14,180 --> 05:16:15,139
I may have given up.

3461
05:16:15,220 --> 05:16:19,909
I may have given up a little.

3462
05:16:19,909 --> 05:16:21,029
Not completely.

3463
05:16:21,029 --> 05:16:21,529
100%.

3464
05:16:26,900 --> 05:16:33,490
Although blurry, squint your eyes a little.

3465
05:16:33,490 --> 05:16:34,770
I'm going to finish it.

3466
05:16:34,770 --> 05:16:35,569
Don't worry.

3467
05:16:35,569 --> 05:16:39,459
I came this far.

3468
05:16:40,599 --> 05:16:41,720
You think it was not going to finish?

3469
05:16:54,290 --> 05:16:56,689
I'm going to turn into a Final Fantasy character.

3470
05:17:03,759 --> 05:17:05,520
What's with the hair not being over here?

3471
05:17:06,610 --> 05:17:08,049
Oh my god.

3472
05:17:08,049 --> 05:17:11,459
And why does my internet suck?

3473
05:17:32,159 --> 05:17:34,319
Almost done with this part.

3474
05:17:34,319 --> 05:17:40,080
This needs to be fixed over here.

3475
05:17:40,080 --> 05:17:42,080
I just need a little more going this way.

3476
05:17:44,819 --> 05:17:45,779
It's very flat.

3477
05:17:45,779 --> 05:17:47,139
My hair is not that flat.

3478
05:18:11,909 --> 05:18:13,029
It does look like a wig.

3479
05:18:17,619 --> 05:18:18,020
All right.

3480
05:18:18,020 --> 05:18:18,419
I need...

3481
05:18:21,619 --> 05:18:21,939
No.

3482
05:18:21,939 --> 05:18:22,340
Back it up.

3483
05:18:22,340 --> 05:18:22,740
Back it up.

3484
05:18:22,740 --> 05:18:23,459
Back it up.

3485
05:18:23,459 --> 05:18:31,779
Put my eyes in there.

3486
05:18:32,580 --> 05:18:36,259
And then I'll do some more detail.

3487
05:18:36,979 --> 05:18:40,799
And I need the...

3488
05:18:41,439 --> 05:18:41,599
No.

3489
05:18:41,599 --> 05:18:42,959
I need the spray paint tool.

3490
05:18:47,009 --> 05:18:47,330
Paint.

3491
05:18:48,450 --> 05:18:52,689
I'm going to go white and spray paint.

3492
05:19:16,959 --> 05:19:20,560
This no joke looks like a skinny version of my dad's face.

3493
05:19:27,599 --> 05:19:28,479
Does it?

3494
05:19:28,479 --> 05:19:31,720
All right.

3495
05:19:31,720 --> 05:19:31,959
Okay.

3496
05:19:32,680 --> 05:19:34,659
I'm going to do one circle of black.

3497
05:19:35,459 --> 05:19:42,869
Which it's like here.

3498
05:19:43,750 --> 05:19:50,119
No.

3499
05:19:50,119 --> 05:19:50,759
I need blue.

3500
05:19:51,560 --> 05:19:52,279
Blue first.

3501
05:19:52,840 --> 05:19:55,880
What kind of blue is it?

3502
05:19:56,439 --> 05:19:57,799
It's like a slate blue.

3503
05:19:58,520 --> 05:19:59,779
It's like this.

3504
05:20:04,419 --> 05:20:04,740
Thank you.

3505
05:20:04,740 --> 05:20:05,380
I'll take it.

3506
05:20:05,380 --> 05:20:05,619
Yes.

3507
05:20:08,259 --> 05:20:08,500
Yes.

3508
05:20:08,500 --> 05:20:09,860
I'd love to paint with this, please.

3509
05:20:10,419 --> 05:20:39,110
It doesn't help.

3510
05:20:43,250 --> 05:20:48,950
Don't worry.

3511
05:20:48,950 --> 05:20:51,509
We're going to do terrifying nightmare face Jeremy.

3512
05:21:12,529 --> 05:21:12,770
Red.

3513
05:21:13,409 --> 05:21:13,729
All right.

3514
05:21:13,729 --> 05:21:14,770
What kind of red?

3515
05:21:14,770 --> 05:21:18,930
It's not that red.

3516
05:21:26,150 --> 05:21:27,509
It's not that red either.

3517
05:21:34,599 --> 05:21:37,080
This is very, very, very bad.

3518
05:21:37,080 --> 05:21:38,419
It's okay.

3519
05:21:38,419 --> 05:21:39,299
It's like this.

3520
05:21:42,159 --> 05:21:42,639
There we go.

3521
05:21:42,639 --> 05:21:43,599
That's better.

3522
05:21:43,599 --> 05:22:06,000
This just needs to be sculpted by somebody that knows what they're doing.

3523
05:22:06,000 --> 05:22:06,319
Not me.

3524
05:22:07,119 --> 05:22:15,569
All right.

3525
05:22:17,409 --> 05:22:19,090
I don't know why this hair looks so strange.

3526
05:22:38,400 --> 05:22:38,799
No, no, no.

3527
05:22:38,799 --> 05:22:39,439
I don't want to paint.

3528
05:22:40,319 --> 05:22:51,669
This doesn't look right.

3529
05:22:51,669 --> 05:22:52,950
It just doesn't look right.

3530
05:22:56,799 --> 05:22:57,040
No.

3531
05:22:58,880 --> 05:23:03,509
Somehow that looks better.

3532
05:23:03,509 --> 05:23:04,470
No, I forgot the eyebrows.

3533
05:23:04,470 --> 05:23:04,790
You're right.

3534
05:23:04,790 --> 05:23:05,509
But this needs to be...

3535
05:23:06,069 --> 05:23:30,880
I just look like Tom Green.

3536
05:23:30,880 --> 05:23:39,360
Maybe it's...

3537
05:23:39,360 --> 05:23:40,080
Maybe let me paint the...

3538
05:23:40,080 --> 05:23:49,119
Let me get the eyebrows painted on.

3539
05:23:49,119 --> 05:23:52,689
And then what else to do about this?

3540
05:23:52,689 --> 05:24:03,700
Let's try eyebrows and see if that helps.

3541
05:24:33,560 --> 05:24:34,520
Kind of helps a little.

3542
05:24:42,880 --> 05:24:45,040
My face is too rounded over here.

3543
05:24:45,040 --> 05:24:59,669
See?

3544
05:24:59,669 --> 05:25:00,470
That could be me.

3545
05:25:00,470 --> 05:25:10,840
I definitely...

3546
05:25:10,840 --> 05:25:11,479
I'm going to do...

3547
05:25:11,479 --> 05:25:12,119
Yeah.

3548
05:25:12,119 --> 05:25:13,959
The hair is too fucking stupid looking.

3549
05:25:15,080 --> 05:25:30,880
Okay.

3550
05:25:30,880 --> 05:25:32,880
The hair is wrong a little by a little bit.

3551
05:25:32,880 --> 05:25:40,310
Let me try to fix that.

3552
05:25:40,950 --> 05:25:42,770
All right.

3553
05:25:42,770 --> 05:25:43,090
So here.

3554
05:25:43,090 --> 05:25:48,759
Get your screenshot now because I'm going to try to fix it.

3555
05:25:49,319 --> 05:25:55,569
Okay.

3556
05:26:25,430 --> 05:26:26,950
Makes you a little stranger.

3557
05:26:27,669 --> 05:26:29,860
What if I doesn't kill you?

3558
05:26:30,500 --> 05:26:41,090
I went a little too far.

3559
05:27:22,599 --> 05:27:23,560
Nightmarish.

3560
05:27:23,560 --> 05:27:24,599
You ain't seen nothing yet.

3561
05:27:25,319 --> 05:27:41,380
Which color is it?

3562
05:27:41,380 --> 05:27:42,259
This one?

3563
05:27:42,259 --> 05:27:42,950
No.

3564
05:27:42,950 --> 05:27:44,630
What's like the regular just standard?

3565
05:27:45,590 --> 05:27:46,549
Just default one.

3566
05:27:47,349 --> 05:28:03,830
How do I just get default color?

3567
05:28:04,869 --> 05:28:11,970
Oh, whatever.

3568
05:28:14,790 --> 05:28:15,590
Save this one.

3569
05:28:16,389 --> 05:28:23,779
There is a color...

3570
05:28:23,779 --> 05:28:24,900
This is like the color picker.

3571
05:28:24,900 --> 05:28:27,060
But I don't understand how this works.

3572
05:28:27,860 --> 05:28:29,299
Like pure and then mixed.

3573
05:28:29,299 --> 05:28:29,540
I...

3574
05:28:30,580 --> 05:28:33,139
I don't understand how this is...

3575
05:28:33,139 --> 05:28:34,659
Custom picker, right?

3576
05:28:36,200 --> 05:28:38,040
And then pick a shade.

3577
05:28:38,119 --> 05:28:38,360
Okay.

3578
05:28:39,159 --> 05:28:40,040
But it's not doing it.

3579
05:28:40,040 --> 05:28:41,479
And then it's like, whoa, this is...

3580
05:28:41,479 --> 05:28:42,279
Save color.

3581
05:28:42,279 --> 05:28:44,360
Well, then it's confusing.

3582
05:28:44,919 --> 05:28:52,389
It's like the eye drop tool in a way, I guess.

3583
05:28:53,110 --> 05:29:18,819
No, that's not going to work.

3584
05:29:19,700 --> 05:29:23,779
Must be bigger.

3585
05:29:23,779 --> 05:29:31,299
Come on now.

3586
05:29:31,939 --> 05:29:35,139
Come on.

3587
05:29:35,779 --> 05:29:37,330
What are you waiting for?

3588
05:29:37,970 --> 05:29:42,319
Come on.

3589
05:29:42,319 --> 05:29:43,840
I'm trying to do like a jaw breaker.

3590
05:29:43,840 --> 05:29:46,240
Like I'm chewing on a big bubble gum thing.

3591
05:29:46,240 --> 05:30:03,479
It has to be on the other side too.

3592
05:30:03,479 --> 05:30:05,700
Because I'm like crunching on this side.

3593
05:30:05,700 --> 05:30:12,979
A little too much.

3594
05:30:12,979 --> 05:30:27,080
Do you have to be like this game?

3595
05:30:28,840 --> 05:30:29,720
Do you have to be like this?

3596
05:30:29,720 --> 05:30:30,439
What's going on?

3597
05:30:31,240 --> 05:30:32,369
What's the problem?

3598
05:30:34,180 --> 05:30:34,979
There's no problem.

3599
05:30:34,979 --> 05:30:35,700
Stop snapping.

3600
05:30:36,259 --> 05:30:37,139
Don't be like this.

3601
05:30:37,700 --> 05:30:54,959
I need like a wincing face too.

3602
05:30:55,599 --> 05:30:59,009
No, I should be blowing like a bubble.

3603
05:30:59,569 --> 05:31:16,080
Oops.

3604
05:31:17,119 --> 05:31:17,919
Not that deep.

3605
05:31:17,919 --> 05:31:40,200
Pull it forward a little.

3606
05:32:04,979 --> 05:32:05,380
Jesus.

3607
05:32:07,439 --> 05:32:21,110
Pretty good.

3608
05:32:21,669 --> 05:32:32,599
I'm going to turn the nose a little bit.

3609
05:32:32,599 --> 05:32:33,560
Like if I was...

3610
05:32:34,360 --> 05:32:37,889
It should be pulled up a little on this side.

3611
05:32:59,430 --> 05:33:00,790
You have to animate this?

3612
05:33:00,790 --> 05:33:01,590
The eye doesn't...

3613
05:33:01,590 --> 05:33:02,869
I don't even know how to do that.

3614
05:33:03,029 --> 05:33:12,439
Turn this down.

3615
05:33:14,639 --> 05:33:16,319
These eyes have to close a little.

3616
05:33:17,040 --> 05:33:18,950
This.

3617
05:33:19,590 --> 05:33:41,360
It just looks like somebody beat him up.

3618
05:33:41,360 --> 05:33:42,959
These brows need to change a little.

3619
05:33:43,520 --> 05:33:44,790
Oops.

3620
05:33:45,590 --> 05:33:59,970
Like that.

3621
05:34:06,290 --> 05:34:06,689
All right.

3622
05:34:13,639 --> 05:34:16,279
The nose needs to connect to the eyebrows.

3623
05:34:16,279 --> 05:34:17,240
Does it though?

3624
05:34:17,240 --> 05:34:23,810
No, he's eating the big candy.

3625
05:34:23,810 --> 05:34:27,250
All right.

3626
05:34:27,250 --> 05:34:28,529
Now I'm going to make my body.

3627
05:34:28,529 --> 05:34:33,319
What do I have on?

3628
05:34:33,319 --> 05:34:34,040
Blue shirt.

3629
05:34:34,040 --> 05:34:37,700
Bookers all over the nose.

3630
05:35:13,479 --> 05:35:13,720
Okay.

3631
05:35:42,560 --> 05:35:42,959
Not bad.

3632
05:35:49,639 --> 05:35:50,200
No, that's...

3633
05:35:50,200 --> 05:35:51,319
I'm an earthworm.

3634
05:35:51,319 --> 05:36:08,689
A little lower.

3635
05:36:08,689 --> 05:36:17,270
That looks all right.

3636
05:36:29,189 --> 05:36:29,590
Okay.

3637
05:36:30,630 --> 05:36:35,990
And let's do some more work over here.

3638
05:37:20,200 --> 05:37:21,080
Don't give it arms.

3639
05:37:21,080 --> 05:37:21,959
Why not?

3640
05:37:21,959 --> 05:37:34,279
Okay.

3641
05:37:34,279 --> 05:37:37,970
Let's group these together.

3642
05:37:38,770 --> 05:37:42,180
They already grouped?

3643
05:37:50,150 --> 05:37:51,189
Are they grouped already?

3644
05:37:51,189 --> 05:37:51,590
I got it.

3645
05:37:51,590 --> 05:37:51,909
They are.

3646
05:37:51,909 --> 05:37:52,229
Okay.

3647
05:38:27,060 --> 05:38:31,459
I need to do it a little differently though.

3648
05:38:59,540 --> 05:39:01,220
Why is everybody so horrified?

3649
05:39:01,220 --> 05:39:03,220
I can't make a fucking monster?

3650
05:39:03,220 --> 05:39:15,970
Turn the snap back on.

3651
05:39:15,970 --> 05:39:17,090
Yeah, that's actually a good idea.

3652
05:39:17,810 --> 05:39:24,720
Let's get down in here.

3653
05:39:24,720 --> 05:39:32,000
And now I'm not even going to just copy.

3654
05:39:33,360 --> 05:39:39,119
God.

3655
05:39:39,200 --> 05:39:40,919
I hate that so much.

3656
05:40:15,959 --> 05:40:16,360
Oops.

3657
05:40:18,869 --> 05:40:19,509
Stand back.

3658
05:40:19,509 --> 05:40:26,470
I'm going to vomit.

3659
05:40:26,470 --> 05:40:26,950
All right.

3660
05:40:26,950 --> 05:40:27,189
Fine.

3661
05:40:27,909 --> 05:40:29,349
I'll conclude it here.

3662
05:40:29,349 --> 05:40:32,770
But not yet.

3663
05:40:32,770 --> 05:41:15,919
I have to put a blue shirt on them.

3664
05:41:15,919 --> 05:41:22,180
And I have to put them on like a stone pedestal.

3665
05:41:22,180 --> 05:41:23,139
Oh, fuck.

3666
05:41:23,139 --> 05:41:27,040
I never grouped these together.

3667
05:41:27,040 --> 05:41:33,169
Oopsie daisy.

3668
05:41:33,169 --> 05:41:49,060
Looks all right.

3669
05:41:52,130 --> 05:41:54,770
Oh, didn't group those together either.

3670
05:41:54,770 --> 05:42:03,380
Going so slow.

3671
05:42:03,380 --> 05:42:12,849
No, deselect.

3672
05:42:12,849 --> 05:42:25,040
Am I selecting the beard too?

3673
05:42:25,040 --> 05:42:25,599
I hope so.

3674
05:42:40,209 --> 05:42:40,849
Okay.

3675
05:42:40,849 --> 05:42:45,200
One, two, three, four.

3676
05:42:45,200 --> 05:42:45,599
What?

3677
05:42:45,599 --> 05:42:51,319
I thought this game was going to make me puke.

3678
05:42:55,540 --> 05:42:55,939
Okay.

3679
05:42:56,659 --> 05:42:57,060
Grab.

3680
05:42:58,049 --> 05:43:00,840
Two, three.

3681
05:43:00,840 --> 05:43:01,400
Group them.

3682
05:43:04,200 --> 05:43:21,840
What are you doing?

3683
05:43:23,939 --> 05:43:24,259
No.

3684
05:43:24,259 --> 05:43:25,860
Now I have to ungroup this shit.

3685
05:43:41,380 --> 05:43:42,659
Oh, I'm about to fucking exit the game.

3686
05:43:47,119 --> 05:43:49,360
I'm just trying to group these together.

3687
05:43:51,299 --> 05:43:56,880
I did it already.

3688
05:43:56,880 --> 05:43:58,240
Oh my god.

3689
05:43:58,240 --> 05:44:19,060
Okay, that's better.

3690
05:44:19,700 --> 05:44:26,529
I'm not even sure this is attached.

3691
05:44:33,540 --> 05:44:34,020
No, it is.

3692
05:44:35,680 --> 05:44:36,080
All right.

3693
05:44:36,080 --> 05:44:37,759
Now for the final finishing touches,

3694
05:44:37,759 --> 05:44:39,759
I need to put a little t-shirt on them

3695
05:44:39,759 --> 05:44:45,220
and then turn this into stone.

3696
05:44:45,220 --> 05:44:46,259
Mad because bad.

3697
05:44:46,259 --> 05:44:47,060
Mad because bad.

3698
05:44:48,340 --> 05:44:50,740
It takes a lot of fucking work to figure this shit out.

3699
05:44:56,080 --> 05:44:58,319
Even still, I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

3700
05:44:58,319 --> 05:45:00,000
Now let's do this.

3701
05:45:00,560 --> 05:45:08,419
And then I want to make this stone.

3702
05:45:09,060 --> 05:45:10,259
I'm going to make them shiny.

3703
05:45:10,900 --> 05:45:22,229
Let's go with a shiny.

3704
05:45:22,790 --> 05:45:23,669
See what this looks like.

3705
05:45:32,310 --> 05:45:32,630
Perfect.

3706
05:45:32,630 --> 05:45:33,349
Nice and sweaty.

3707
05:45:33,909 --> 05:45:49,830
Oh, it looks like it's made of the glass.

3708
05:45:50,630 --> 05:45:59,959
Okay, now the color is fine.

3709
05:46:00,520 --> 05:46:02,520
Although I do need to change the color of this

3710
05:46:02,520 --> 05:46:03,720
because I just want this to be stone.

3711
05:46:04,759 --> 05:46:08,020
Yeah, just like a little place to show off.

3712
05:46:08,580 --> 05:46:10,099
Maybe a little bit darker.

3713
05:46:10,819 --> 05:46:11,860
I think that's better.

3714
05:46:12,419 --> 05:46:16,439
I'm going to make glowing red eyes.

3715
05:46:17,400 --> 05:46:25,779
I don't even know if I can do that.

3716
05:46:26,419 --> 05:46:42,959
Oh, I can definitely do that.

3717
05:46:44,549 --> 05:46:45,669
Glowing red, you got it.

3718
05:46:46,389 --> 05:46:49,380
I still have to put a t-shirt on them.

3719
05:46:49,380 --> 05:47:02,279
Okay, let's make these glow red.

3720
05:47:03,080 --> 05:47:13,830
I want these things to move around too.

3721
05:47:19,759 --> 05:47:20,319
They moving?

3722
05:47:20,880 --> 05:47:41,189
I don't think so.

3723
05:47:42,560 --> 05:47:44,799
He's wet, but I'm going to put rain in.

3724
05:47:44,799 --> 05:47:45,759
Thanks for telling me.

3725
05:47:45,759 --> 05:48:07,479
Let me glow.

3726
05:48:08,279 --> 05:48:09,889
Where is it under?

3727
05:48:09,889 --> 05:48:10,770
Is it under style?

3728
05:48:10,770 --> 05:48:11,330
Yeah.

3729
05:48:11,330 --> 05:48:11,970
No, it's not.

3730
05:48:11,970 --> 05:48:12,369
Where is it?

3731
05:48:13,409 --> 05:48:15,459
Glow right here.

3732
05:48:15,459 --> 05:48:15,860
Glow.

3733
05:48:16,500 --> 05:48:20,479
Now I want this to be red.

3734
05:48:25,279 --> 05:48:32,310
This glow, glow.

3735
05:48:40,799 --> 05:48:41,360
It works.

3736
05:48:41,919 --> 05:48:43,729
That's got a lot of glow.

3737
05:48:43,729 --> 05:48:55,639
I don't think it works.

3738
05:48:56,279 --> 05:48:57,080
How about blue?

3739
05:48:57,080 --> 05:48:58,200
Because my eyes are blue.

3740
05:49:11,700 --> 05:49:15,380
Why is it still red?

3741
05:49:15,380 --> 05:49:16,099
No, whatever.

3742
05:49:23,110 --> 05:49:25,880
All right, rain.

3743
05:49:30,479 --> 05:49:31,840
So we need paint.

3744
05:49:31,840 --> 05:49:34,209
I've got to go over here.

3745
05:49:34,209 --> 05:49:38,130
We've got to do the ruler.

3746
05:49:38,130 --> 05:49:41,540
We're going to put like fucking lightning and shit in the background.

3747
05:49:41,540 --> 05:49:42,819
I have to add a penis.

3748
05:49:42,819 --> 05:49:43,459
No, I don't.

3749
05:49:43,459 --> 05:49:45,139
I don't have to do that actually.

3750
05:49:45,139 --> 05:49:49,619
I'm going to do straight line, right?

3751
05:49:49,619 --> 05:49:52,119
Straight, make it blue.

3752
05:49:52,840 --> 05:50:11,520
Okay, now I should be able to...

3753
05:50:16,000 --> 05:50:17,119
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

3754
05:50:17,119 --> 05:50:24,180
Hey, hey, hey, where's the other one?

3755
05:50:24,180 --> 05:50:25,700
Oh, just like blend in.

3756
05:50:25,700 --> 05:50:33,560
And now I should be able to open up this menu.

3757
05:50:34,360 --> 05:50:39,090
And we're going to go to animation, playback settings.

3758
05:50:39,810 --> 05:50:40,979
There we go.

3759
05:50:41,700 --> 05:50:43,270
Trail length.

3760
05:50:43,830 --> 05:50:49,090
Okay.

3761
05:50:49,090 --> 05:50:53,110
That's taking a long time to fall.

3762
05:51:00,979 --> 05:51:03,060
Not the best rain I've ever made.

3763
05:51:12,580 --> 05:51:13,540
Zoom it out.

3764
05:51:13,540 --> 05:51:18,340
I think I made them too big.

3765
05:51:18,340 --> 05:51:56,040
Animate in sequence, pulse, spread.

3766
05:51:56,040 --> 05:51:56,520
There we go.

3767
05:51:58,959 --> 05:51:59,599
Jitter.

3768
05:51:59,599 --> 05:52:00,159
There we go.

3769
05:52:00,799 --> 05:52:06,080
It needs to be better looking though.

3770
05:52:06,080 --> 05:52:07,520
Looks weird.

3771
05:52:07,520 --> 05:52:14,069
Get this out of the way.

3772
05:52:14,069 --> 05:52:34,529
I wonder how...

3773
05:52:35,490 --> 05:52:41,090
I need this to go faster.

3774
05:52:46,560 --> 05:52:47,360
There we go.

3775
05:52:47,360 --> 05:52:47,680
Okay.

3776
05:52:48,240 --> 05:52:54,150
Not really.

3777
05:52:54,150 --> 05:52:59,909
I thought I had it.

3778
05:52:59,909 --> 05:53:20,759
Because these need to be spread out a little bit more.

3779
05:53:21,959 --> 05:53:26,900
The effects.

3780
05:53:26,900 --> 05:53:27,299
Boil.

3781
05:53:28,709 --> 05:53:29,029
No.

3782
05:53:30,599 --> 05:53:31,560
Evaporate.

3783
05:53:31,560 --> 05:53:32,599
Ooh, okay.

3784
05:53:32,599 --> 05:53:33,639
There we are.

3785
05:53:33,639 --> 05:53:35,270
That's how we get droplets.

3786
05:53:39,779 --> 05:53:41,459
And throb maybe?

3787
05:53:41,459 --> 05:53:46,180
They're just in weird places.

3788
05:53:57,119 --> 05:53:58,240
Maximum throb.

3789
05:53:58,880 --> 05:54:03,250
Let me go down here and like look up.

3790
05:54:07,360 --> 05:54:07,599
Yeah.

3791
05:54:08,400 --> 05:54:09,119
I'm close.

3792
05:54:09,860 --> 05:54:11,380
I'm really close.

3793
05:54:11,380 --> 05:54:12,900
It's just not quite there.

3794
05:54:15,000 --> 05:54:15,880
Almost there.

3795
05:54:15,880 --> 05:54:17,080
But not quite.

3796
05:54:17,080 --> 05:54:40,439
How are you talking without moving your mouth?

3797
05:54:40,439 --> 05:54:45,139
That's like ice.

3798
05:54:45,139 --> 05:54:48,450
Maybe you just shrink it.

3799
05:54:48,450 --> 05:54:54,080
Drop the opacity too.

3800
05:54:54,080 --> 05:54:54,799
Hey, look at that.

3801
05:54:54,799 --> 05:54:55,680
It looks a little better.

3802
05:54:56,319 --> 05:55:06,599
Turn it down.

3803
05:55:06,599 --> 05:55:07,080
Turn it down.

3804
05:55:07,080 --> 05:55:07,560
Turn it down.

3805
05:55:07,560 --> 05:55:08,040
Turn it down.

3806
05:55:08,040 --> 05:55:08,599
Turn it down.

3807
05:55:08,599 --> 05:55:09,240
Turn it down.

3808
05:55:09,880 --> 05:55:10,599
Oh God.

3809
05:55:11,159 --> 05:55:21,810
I can't turn it down.

3810
05:55:21,810 --> 05:55:22,049
All right.

3811
05:55:22,049 --> 05:55:23,090
That's good enough.

3812
05:55:23,090 --> 05:55:26,150
Now we just need some scary sounds.

3813
05:55:26,150 --> 05:55:36,869
It's almost like a windstorm.

3814
05:55:36,869 --> 05:55:37,270
Ooh.

3815
05:55:37,830 --> 05:55:49,380
I actually like that.

3816
05:55:57,060 --> 05:55:58,659
That really really does look like a windstorm.

3817
05:55:59,619 --> 05:56:14,880
All right.

3818
05:56:14,880 --> 05:56:15,279
You guys.

3819
05:56:16,770 --> 05:56:17,490
You guys remember.

3820
05:56:19,590 --> 05:56:25,080
I'm gonna take these off now.

3821
05:56:25,080 --> 05:56:26,360
Kim just brought up this.

3822
05:56:31,279 --> 05:56:31,840
Look at this.

3823
05:56:32,479 --> 05:56:35,810
I feel like I'm having like dreams again.

3824
05:56:36,529 --> 05:56:37,729
Of this same.

3825
05:56:37,729 --> 05:56:39,569
This is like the same amazing dinner.

3826
05:56:40,209 --> 05:56:41,729
Is it the same day?

3827
05:56:41,729 --> 05:56:44,549
This is fucking awesome.

3828
05:56:44,549 --> 05:56:46,290
She just made it apparently.

3829
05:56:50,639 --> 05:56:52,159
I like it the way it is.

3830
05:56:52,159 --> 05:56:55,409
I like it like that.

3831
05:56:55,409 --> 05:56:59,279
I am going to put on some song here.

3832
05:56:59,279 --> 05:56:59,840
Some music.

3833
05:57:00,400 --> 05:57:06,240
No, I don't want sound gadgets.

3834
05:57:06,240 --> 05:57:08,400
I just want like rain and thunder.

3835
05:57:08,400 --> 05:57:09,520
And scary music.

3836
05:57:15,970 --> 05:57:20,959
Right here.

3837
05:57:20,959 --> 05:57:21,360
All right.

3838
05:57:21,360 --> 05:57:21,759
Rain.

3839
05:57:29,349 --> 05:57:33,119
This means this is the field where you hear it.

3840
05:57:33,119 --> 05:57:34,959
But you'll hear it the whole time anyways.

3841
05:57:35,520 --> 05:57:38,549
Now I need like lightning strikes.

3842
05:57:44,709 --> 05:57:50,470
I like that too.

3843
05:57:51,110 --> 05:57:56,450
All right.

3844
05:57:56,450 --> 05:57:57,569
Now I need scary music.

3845
05:58:02,229 --> 05:58:02,470
Okay.

3846
05:58:06,959 --> 05:58:07,360
So you guys.

3847
05:58:07,360 --> 06:00:12,689
I couldn't go in fast enough.

3848
06:00:12,689 --> 06:00:13,009
Really.

3849
06:00:14,930 --> 06:00:16,930
I was trying to go in really fast to his face.

3850
06:00:24,049 --> 06:00:24,610
All right.

3851
06:00:24,610 --> 06:00:26,610
I think that's going to be it for dreams for now.

3852
06:00:27,810 --> 06:00:31,110
Unless does it does anybody?

3853
06:00:31,750 --> 06:00:32,790
Did anybody make something?

3854
06:00:33,590 --> 06:00:35,220
Did anybody make something?

3855
06:00:36,639 --> 06:00:49,400
I could hear that from my kitchen.

3856
06:00:50,919 --> 06:00:57,400
Let me check again.

3857
06:00:57,400 --> 06:01:05,720
I'm going to save this as a final.

3858
06:01:05,720 --> 06:01:10,610
My creation three.

3859
06:01:20,500 --> 06:01:23,060
Imagine coming across that thumbnail.

3860
06:01:27,240 --> 06:01:27,479
Okay.

3861
06:01:28,200 --> 06:01:29,159
Here's what I made today.

3862
06:01:32,709 --> 06:01:37,639
Those of you that didn't see this before.

3863
06:01:38,279 --> 06:01:39,299
I will show it to you.

3864
06:01:45,860 --> 06:01:47,139
It's the ice cream.

3865
06:01:47,139 --> 06:01:53,009
That's so fucking funny.

3866
06:01:53,009 --> 06:01:53,889
I can't believe that.

3867
06:01:56,369 --> 06:01:57,409
I forgot about that.

3868
06:01:58,290 --> 06:01:59,409
Germapopsicle.

3869
06:02:00,450 --> 06:02:01,409
Or Germapop.

3870
06:02:02,290 --> 06:02:03,330
I don't know what that'll be.

3871
06:02:08,930 --> 06:02:13,779
I love how I just made a better version of this today.

3872
06:02:13,779 --> 06:02:14,979
You don't talk about progress?

3873
06:02:14,979 --> 06:02:15,220
All right.

3874
06:02:15,220 --> 06:02:15,619
Look at this.

3875
06:02:16,340 --> 06:02:17,619
Take a look at that thing.

3876
06:02:17,619 --> 06:02:21,729
Tell me that I didn't make progress today.

3877
06:02:22,290 --> 06:02:28,360
Okay.

3878
06:02:29,000 --> 06:02:31,080
You don't think I made progress today?

3879
06:02:47,330 --> 06:02:48,849
And then what was the other one I did?

3880
06:02:48,849 --> 06:02:50,770
I spent like three and a half hours on that other thing.

3881
06:02:56,630 --> 06:02:57,830
I don't even remember this one.

3882
06:02:59,119 --> 06:02:59,680
Oh God.

3883
06:03:00,319 --> 06:03:14,360
Oh yeah.

3884
06:03:14,360 --> 06:03:15,000
Now I remember.

3885
06:03:15,799 --> 06:03:20,599
I wanted to fix this.

3886
06:03:29,720 --> 06:03:30,919
King of the Monsters.

3887
06:03:33,779 --> 06:03:37,479
Oh, well there you go.

3888
06:03:41,330 --> 06:03:44,450
There are those are my three dreams that I was able to come out of my head

3889
06:03:45,250 --> 06:03:46,290
in the last 12 hours.

3890
06:03:47,090 --> 06:03:51,040
And I'll tell you my final assessment of the game so far.

3891
06:03:51,040 --> 06:03:52,080
Well, finalism.

3892
06:03:52,080 --> 06:03:57,279
I think we dropped a lot of frames too.

3893
06:03:58,319 --> 06:03:59,599
I think this game is really, really good.

3894
06:04:00,790 --> 06:04:01,590
It's really awesome.

3895
06:04:02,840 --> 06:04:04,680
I love the idea.

3896
06:04:06,680 --> 06:04:10,759
I just want, I want some different control schemes.

3897
06:04:11,639 --> 06:04:17,139
Because I would almost much rather the camera be the gyroscope.

3898
06:04:18,340 --> 06:04:21,220
Like I can tilt the camera around and have it set to sensitivity

3899
06:04:21,220 --> 06:04:23,060
and use the sticks to move other stuff around.

3900
06:04:23,860 --> 06:04:29,139
I don't know how true this is,

3901
06:04:29,139 --> 06:04:31,939
but someone who's mentioning that a mouse and keyboard, right?

3902
06:04:35,459 --> 06:04:36,099
Does that work?

3903
06:04:36,979 --> 06:04:43,400
That sounds worse.

3904
06:04:43,400 --> 06:04:44,119
I really just don't know.

3905
06:04:44,119 --> 06:04:49,159
It's hard to make a game like this on console that has this much detail.

3906
06:04:55,889 --> 06:04:58,119
And the journey so far.

3907
06:04:58,919 --> 06:05:02,520
Depending on, I know a lot of people were saying earlier in the stream

3908
06:05:02,520 --> 06:05:08,520
and I kind of lashed back about how this is a boring stream or whatever.

3909
06:05:08,520 --> 06:05:11,720
But this is really the time that I have to do it.

3910
06:05:12,680 --> 06:05:13,319
You know what I'm saying?

3911
06:05:14,040 --> 06:05:19,970
And sure, I can turn the stream off right now and go play it again.

3912
06:05:21,159 --> 06:05:25,959
But, you know, there's other things that I have to do.

3913
06:05:25,959 --> 06:05:36,439
And speaking of other things, just trying one of those tomatoes.

3914
06:05:37,080 --> 06:05:38,880
I gotta get this off the screen.

3915
06:05:39,840 --> 06:05:42,450
Okay, there we go.

3916
06:05:45,700 --> 06:05:47,380
Not every stream has to be like 100 miles per hour.

3917
06:05:48,099 --> 06:05:48,580
Yeah, I know.

3918
06:05:49,380 --> 06:05:52,259
And I'm honestly just trying to learn a new game.

3919
06:05:53,299 --> 06:05:57,860
You can't know everything and know every single thing works

3920
06:05:58,500 --> 06:06:03,220
in the first 10 to 12 hours of a game that's designed to put hundreds.

3921
06:06:07,139 --> 06:06:11,459
But I know that people want to see more high octane kind of stuff on the stream.

3922
06:06:12,529 --> 06:06:16,840
But I don't really have any other option than to stream it.

3923
06:06:16,840 --> 06:06:18,200
Because if I don't stream this game,

3924
06:06:19,000 --> 06:06:21,959
that look, for instance, like tomorrow and Friday, right?

3925
06:06:21,959 --> 06:06:23,400
I'm not playing Dreams.

3926
06:06:25,700 --> 06:06:33,540
I'm not learning more things tomorrow.

3927
06:06:33,540 --> 06:06:34,340
But it's all good.

3928
06:06:38,360 --> 06:06:39,080
Surf some more?

3929
06:06:41,720 --> 06:06:47,189
Yeah, well, we will do this all tomorrow.

3930
06:06:47,189 --> 06:06:47,750
Tomorrow?

3931
06:06:53,330 --> 06:06:55,009
Well, I'm not, no, the stream's not over yet.

3932
06:06:55,650 --> 06:07:00,049
Because I do want to search for to see if anybody made any German related stuff.

3933
06:07:00,049 --> 06:07:01,009
J-U-R-M-A.

3934
06:07:01,970 --> 06:07:06,950
But tomorrow is going to be, the start time is going to be different.

3935
06:07:07,349 --> 06:07:10,520
Let me see.

3936
06:07:11,240 --> 06:07:16,020
Depending on when I get up tomorrow, I might go early, like really early.

3937
06:07:16,020 --> 06:07:16,740
Let me see.

3938
06:07:17,459 --> 06:07:19,540
It's either going to be really early or a little bit later.

3939
06:07:20,340 --> 06:07:29,090
All right.

3940
06:07:29,090 --> 06:07:31,889
We're going to looks like we're going to be an early boy tomorrow.

3941
06:07:36,389 --> 06:07:38,549
And when I say early boy, I mean early.

3942
06:07:39,189 --> 06:07:45,799
This is an EU friendly stream tomorrow.

3943
06:07:46,439 --> 06:07:57,750
I'm probably going to because auto has an appointment at the vet at 5pm Pacific.

3944
06:07:58,950 --> 06:08:02,709
So I'm going to try to start the stream tomorrow somewhere around like 11 or 12.

3945
06:08:03,270 --> 06:08:04,709
Stream for about five or six hours.

3946
06:08:09,240 --> 06:08:11,799
So you're going to get a really early one tomorrow.

3947
06:08:12,360 --> 06:08:13,319
No, he's fine.

3948
06:08:13,319 --> 06:08:13,959
He's fine.

3949
06:08:13,959 --> 06:08:14,360
He's good.

3950
06:08:15,000 --> 06:08:16,520
He just needs to go get a shot.

3951
06:08:16,520 --> 06:08:20,119
He gets a shot every three to four weeks because he has Addison's disease.

3952
06:08:24,479 --> 06:08:27,200
11 or 12 Pacific or Eastern Pacific.

3953
06:08:27,840 --> 06:08:35,080
So somewhere around like three, three ish pm Eastern is when the stream is going

3954
06:08:35,080 --> 06:08:37,639
to start tomorrow.

3955
06:08:37,639 --> 06:08:38,840
He has Addison's disease.

3956
06:08:39,479 --> 06:08:43,720
What am I going to stream?

3957
06:08:43,720 --> 06:08:44,439
That's a good question.

3958
06:08:45,319 --> 06:08:46,040
I really don't know.

3959
06:08:50,020 --> 06:09:02,799
Uh, there's a couple of options, but I really I don't know more dreams.

3960
06:09:02,799 --> 06:09:10,529
Um, maybe maybe maybe maybe make a game next time.

3961
06:09:10,529 --> 06:09:11,409
Like a little platformer.

3962
06:09:11,409 --> 06:09:11,810
I don't know.

3963
06:09:18,279 --> 06:09:18,919
Jet Island.

3964
06:09:18,919 --> 06:09:20,840
I my VR is all packed up right now.

3965
06:09:25,840 --> 06:09:26,560
I don't know.

3966
06:09:26,560 --> 06:09:27,279
I'll figure it out.

3967
06:09:27,840 --> 06:09:40,290
If it's not dreams part two or part three, then it'll be something else with that.

3968
06:09:40,290 --> 06:09:41,970
I am going to switch back to the game.

3969
06:09:42,849 --> 06:09:45,889
And we're going to look to see if anybody has anything.

3970
06:09:46,689 --> 06:09:52,470
Browse all and I believe, um, do I have all this stuff?

3971
06:09:55,490 --> 06:09:55,970
No, no, no, no.

3972
06:09:55,970 --> 06:09:57,009
I want to just get these off.

3973
06:09:57,650 --> 06:09:59,110
Well, should I leave them on?

3974
06:09:59,909 --> 06:10:01,520
Should I leave them on?

3975
06:10:05,250 --> 06:10:08,369
People probably coming in this room just being like, what the fuck is this dude doing?

3976
06:10:13,119 --> 06:10:13,759
Germa.

3977
06:10:14,720 --> 06:10:15,970
Bring it back.

3978
06:10:15,970 --> 06:10:16,290
Oops.

3979
06:10:20,290 --> 06:10:24,369
J E bar may.

3980
06:10:26,880 --> 06:10:27,919
Oh, wait a minute.

3981
06:10:28,479 --> 06:10:31,380
We got a couple.

3982
06:10:31,939 --> 06:10:38,659
Look at that.

3983
06:10:38,659 --> 06:10:41,080
All right.

3984
06:10:41,080 --> 06:10:42,520
This is germa test.

3985
06:10:42,520 --> 06:10:47,540
Let's try this one.

3986
06:10:47,540 --> 06:11:06,419
Uh, just what's what is on my face?

3987
06:11:07,380 --> 06:11:10,680
I'm just in a constant permanent dab.

3988
06:11:11,319 --> 06:11:13,840
That's a pretty nice bog too.

3989
06:11:13,840 --> 06:11:14,000
All right.

3990
06:11:14,000 --> 06:11:14,240
Hold on.

3991
06:11:14,240 --> 06:11:15,599
I want to get like a close look at this.

3992
06:11:22,630 --> 06:11:23,590
Look at that face.

3993
06:11:27,000 --> 06:11:28,759
I'm skipping with one foot.

3994
06:11:33,439 --> 06:11:35,680
My right leg's really bothering me lately.

3995
06:11:35,680 --> 06:11:38,639
That's fucking hilarious.

3996
06:11:38,639 --> 06:11:38,880
All right.

3997
06:11:38,880 --> 06:11:39,759
Let's go back.

3998
06:11:39,759 --> 06:11:40,740
What was that one up?

3999
06:11:44,580 --> 06:11:47,220
And this is germa jup.

4000
06:11:47,860 --> 06:11:49,490
Germa jupiter.

4001
06:11:49,490 --> 06:11:52,360
I think it's just a painting, a little sculpture.

4002
06:11:52,919 --> 06:11:53,159
Yep.

4003
06:11:56,360 --> 06:11:56,759
Okay.

4004
06:11:57,400 --> 06:11:57,720
Yep.

4005
06:11:59,490 --> 06:12:00,689
And it has an ass.

4006
06:12:00,689 --> 06:12:01,330
Of course it does.

4007
06:12:03,240 --> 06:12:04,599
Why wouldn't it have butt cheeks?

4008
06:12:05,240 --> 06:12:12,470
What's the other one?

4009
06:12:12,470 --> 06:12:13,750
We got germa old.

4010
06:12:14,630 --> 06:12:16,869
Germa old and germa old.

4011
06:12:16,869 --> 06:12:40,819
This is a game after streaming for 75 years.

4012
06:12:43,110 --> 06:12:49,159
F tier boomer decides to retire, choosing to leave Vegas for the sticks.

4013
06:12:51,409 --> 06:12:57,639
He can't help to feel something follows from his past.

4014
06:13:16,759 --> 06:13:38,849
This is for real.

4015
06:13:38,849 --> 06:13:50,529
What's in the shed?

4016
06:13:50,529 --> 06:13:56,369
What a nice compact cabin, says me.

4017
06:14:02,040 --> 06:14:02,520
Yeah.

4018
06:14:02,520 --> 06:14:03,080
Is that it?

4019
06:14:03,639 --> 06:14:17,970
What about outside maybe?

4020
06:14:17,970 --> 06:14:31,669
What the fuck?

4021
06:14:31,669 --> 06:14:42,360
Six months later, a noise outside.

4022
06:14:45,990 --> 06:14:47,189
How do you make grass like that?

4023
06:14:47,189 --> 06:14:48,790
Better go check what it was.

4024
06:14:48,790 --> 06:14:50,069
How do you make grass like this?

4025
06:14:50,630 --> 06:14:54,069
How do you make trees like this?

4026
06:14:54,069 --> 06:15:00,150
What's this trail?

4027
06:15:00,150 --> 06:15:04,080
All right.

4028
06:15:04,080 --> 06:15:05,599
How long did it take you to make this?

4029
06:15:08,119 --> 06:15:09,959
How long did it take you to know how to do this?

4030
06:15:09,959 --> 06:15:27,490
Oh wait, there are just assets in the search bar.

4031
06:15:27,490 --> 06:15:30,049
Less time than it took you to make the scorpion ice cream.

4032
06:15:31,799 --> 06:15:32,759
All right, what's over here?

4033
06:15:32,759 --> 06:15:33,560
Is it a bunker?

4034
06:15:34,279 --> 06:15:38,979
What the fuck is going on?

4035
06:16:07,159 --> 06:16:12,400
I think these are the same thing.

4036
06:16:12,400 --> 06:16:13,360
That was fucking awesome.

4037
06:16:19,029 --> 06:16:20,229
For germa!

4038
06:16:20,229 --> 06:16:21,759
What's this one?

4039
06:16:21,759 --> 06:16:22,479
What's this?

4040
06:16:35,669 --> 06:16:36,950
Song made for me?

4041
06:16:37,590 --> 06:16:50,360
I want to see the timeline.

4042
06:17:20,389 --> 06:17:34,419
When I simply remember my favorite things so bad.

4043
06:17:44,200 --> 06:17:51,000
You thought it was going to be a gnome?

4044
06:17:51,000 --> 06:17:55,029
No, that's pretty good.

4045
06:18:00,099 --> 06:18:01,560
What is this one?

4046
06:18:04,869 --> 06:18:06,229
This is a remix of...

4047
06:18:06,790 --> 06:18:11,650
Is this supposed to be me?

4048
06:18:11,650 --> 06:18:15,299
So, okay, I see what you did here.

4049
06:18:15,299 --> 06:18:18,720
You got this asset from somewhere

4050
06:18:18,720 --> 06:18:21,040
and then you put this fucking head on it

4051
06:18:21,040 --> 06:18:23,840
with the Crusty the Clown hair.

4052
06:18:23,840 --> 06:18:24,799
That has to be what it is.

4053
06:18:34,610 --> 06:18:35,250
Remix.

4054
06:18:37,439 --> 06:18:40,150
I love how it just kind of just feeding in here.

4055
06:18:41,490 --> 06:18:43,090
Mystic Manor Preview.

4056
06:18:48,520 --> 06:18:49,080
What is this?

4057
06:18:56,720 --> 06:19:06,290
Mystic Playground.

4058
06:19:07,090 --> 06:19:32,389
Haunted Hedge Maze.

4059
06:19:33,270 --> 06:19:34,790
These are all going to be levels.

4060
06:19:38,549 --> 06:19:43,409
This is pretty great.

4061
06:19:44,209 --> 06:19:49,330
I mean, this is great.

4062
06:19:49,330 --> 06:19:49,830
It is.

4063
06:19:50,450 --> 06:19:56,500
What did mine look like?

4064
06:19:57,540 --> 06:20:03,509
Let me do that.

4065
06:20:03,509 --> 06:20:04,229
That's fucking awesome.

4066
06:20:06,150 --> 06:20:13,200
I think that's it.

4067
06:20:15,909 --> 06:20:16,630
What about mine?

4068
06:20:19,840 --> 06:20:24,790
That's so detailed.

4069
06:20:30,759 --> 06:20:31,560
Is another test.

4070
06:20:33,889 --> 06:20:34,290
All right.

4071
06:20:34,930 --> 06:20:35,810
That was fucking cool.

4072
06:20:36,529 --> 06:20:38,720
Maybe I'll do it again tomorrow.

4073
06:20:38,720 --> 06:20:39,360
Let me see what I made.

4074
06:20:39,360 --> 06:20:39,840
What did I do?

4075
06:20:41,040 --> 06:20:42,180
Let's see mine.

4076
06:20:42,819 --> 06:20:48,119
Pretty sick.

4077
06:20:48,759 --> 06:20:56,740
I have to publish that one.

4078
06:21:02,240 --> 06:21:03,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4079
06:21:03,520 --> 06:21:04,880
I need to like name it something better

4080
06:21:04,880 --> 06:21:08,240
than my creation 8.5 2019.

4081
06:21:08,240 --> 06:21:21,680
How about Worm Worm?

4082
06:21:26,819 --> 06:21:27,860
Sad Worm?

4083
06:21:30,240 --> 06:21:32,560
How about my creation dash Worm?

4084
06:21:33,599 --> 06:21:34,099
Worma.

4085
06:21:40,610 --> 06:21:41,110
Worma?

4086
06:21:46,959 --> 06:21:47,459
Worma.

4087
06:21:53,750 --> 06:21:54,250
Release.

4088
06:21:55,729 --> 06:21:57,650
Save and release this version online as public.

4089
06:21:57,650 --> 06:22:00,209
Discoverable, accessible, and remixable by everyone.

4090
06:22:00,770 --> 06:22:03,439
Version notes tell you you're a collaborator.

4091
06:22:03,439 --> 06:22:03,840
It's not the dream.

4092
06:22:03,840 --> 06:22:05,040
It's anything you want to say about this.

4093
06:22:59,520 --> 06:23:00,560
I want to do like point.

4094
06:23:01,200 --> 06:23:31,400
I want to go.

4095
06:23:31,400 --> 06:23:31,880
Hold on.

4096
06:23:31,880 --> 06:23:33,400
I got to give release notes.

4097
06:23:33,400 --> 06:23:35,779
How do I go down?

4098
06:23:35,779 --> 06:24:15,479
There we go.

4099
06:24:15,479 --> 06:24:16,680
Zero point nine.

4100
06:24:17,799 --> 06:24:19,080
Zero point three.

4101
06:24:19,080 --> 06:24:19,880
Zero point seven.

4102
06:24:19,880 --> 06:24:20,840
Zero point nine.

4103
06:24:20,840 --> 06:24:22,119
He's going backwards.

4104
06:24:29,220 --> 06:24:30,099
No, he's...

4105
06:24:30,099 --> 06:24:45,430
Hold on.

4106
06:24:45,430 --> 06:24:46,470
Made Rain.

4107
06:24:49,110 --> 06:24:52,200
And then 1.0.

4108
06:25:01,799 --> 06:25:44,819
1.0.

4109
06:25:44,819 --> 06:25:45,779
Okay, there we go.

4110
06:25:45,779 --> 06:25:56,639
There are your patch notes.

4111
06:25:56,639 --> 06:25:57,439
Release.

4112
06:25:57,439 --> 06:26:02,520
Release it.

4113
06:26:02,520 --> 06:26:06,080
Here we go.

4114
06:26:06,080 --> 06:26:06,580
Wait.

4115
06:26:16,759 --> 06:26:19,540
Making something public is forever.

4116
06:26:19,540 --> 06:26:20,659
Once you've made something public,

4117
06:26:20,659 --> 06:26:21,939
you won't be able to take it back.

4118
06:26:21,939 --> 06:26:24,419
You will only be able to stop it from appearing in searches

4119
06:26:24,419 --> 06:26:27,060
by unlisting it in the creation setting.

4120
06:26:27,060 --> 06:26:28,819
Do you want to continue?

4121
06:26:28,819 --> 06:26:46,979
I can't thumbs up my own thing.

4122
06:26:46,979 --> 06:26:49,590
Full credits.

4123
06:26:49,590 --> 06:26:50,229
Audio.

4124
06:26:50,229 --> 06:26:52,150
Oh, wait, because the song.

4125
06:26:57,509 --> 06:26:58,389
All right, that's it.

4126
06:26:58,389 --> 06:26:59,430
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4127
06:27:01,680 --> 06:27:05,759
I'm going to do the bits and the subs and all that stuff.

4128
06:27:11,509 --> 06:27:13,029
I may play this, but remember,

4129
06:27:13,029 --> 06:27:14,630
we're going real early tomorrow.

4130
06:27:14,630 --> 06:27:20,049
Starting somewhere around 11 to 12 Pacific time.

4131
06:27:20,610 --> 06:27:32,479
That's wrong.

4132
06:27:41,279 --> 06:27:42,240
It might be dreams.

4133
06:27:42,240 --> 06:27:43,200
It might not.

4134
06:27:43,200 --> 06:27:44,880
I might jump into something else.

4135
06:27:44,880 --> 06:27:52,659
We're going to go back.

4136
06:27:52,659 --> 06:27:55,299
I missed a lot today because I was just really focused

4137
06:27:55,939 --> 06:27:58,319
trying to make sure I was doing things correctly.

4138
06:28:00,840 --> 06:28:02,919
But six and a half hours ago,

4139
06:28:02,919 --> 06:28:06,840
we had $15 come in from Bill Buttlicher.

4140
06:28:07,560 --> 06:28:08,869
Thank you, Bill.

4141
06:28:09,590 --> 06:28:12,610
Thank you, Mr. Buttlicher.

4142
06:28:12,610 --> 06:28:13,250
I appreciate it.

4143
06:28:13,810 --> 06:28:18,500
Long time YouTube viewer.

4144
06:28:18,500 --> 06:28:20,500
I don't get a chance to watch your streams very much

4145
06:28:20,500 --> 06:28:22,020
because I work all the time.

4146
06:28:22,020 --> 06:28:23,139
But thought I would show some support

4147
06:28:23,139 --> 06:28:24,180
for all the hours of entertainment

4148
06:28:24,180 --> 06:28:25,139
you give me over the years.

4149
06:28:28,360 --> 06:28:28,759
Thank you.

4150
06:28:29,400 --> 06:28:32,479
Um, I was on YouTube for a long time.

4151
06:28:32,479 --> 06:28:36,159
You must have been around for a while.

4152
06:28:38,840 --> 06:28:41,490
But always a pleasure to have anybody pop in

4153
06:28:41,490 --> 06:28:43,490
that's been around for a long time.

4154
06:28:45,220 --> 06:28:46,340
Thanks for the $15.

4155
06:28:46,340 --> 06:28:50,930
And thanks for the literally hundreds of hours

4156
06:28:50,930 --> 06:28:53,729
you've spent hanging out watching content.

4157
06:28:56,599 --> 06:28:57,400
It means the world to me.

4158
06:28:57,400 --> 06:28:57,720
Thank you.

4159
06:28:58,439 --> 06:29:00,470
Snooze and Coffin, thanks for the $2.50.

4160
06:29:01,270 --> 06:29:02,229
Jerma, thanks for the stream.

4161
06:29:02,229 --> 06:29:03,110
I can't watch it all today

4162
06:29:03,110 --> 06:29:05,029
because I work tomorrow at 10 30 a.m.

4163
06:29:05,590 --> 06:29:07,430
And it's 2 a.m. here now.

4164
06:29:07,909 --> 06:29:08,950
I was hoping for a stream like this

4165
06:29:08,950 --> 06:29:10,310
and I was worried you already prepared

4166
06:29:10,310 --> 06:29:11,270
something beforehand.

4167
06:29:11,830 --> 06:29:13,509
I look forward to working on dream stuff.

4168
06:29:13,509 --> 06:29:15,830
Apologize alongside you tomorrow.

4169
06:29:16,389 --> 06:29:17,909
Also, are you using the motion controls?

4170
06:29:17,909 --> 06:29:19,830
Heard they're superior in terms of sculpting.

4171
06:29:23,409 --> 06:29:25,169
I'm not using the motion controllers

4172
06:29:25,889 --> 06:29:27,330
but the most controllers I've heard

4173
06:29:28,130 --> 06:29:29,330
they're good for sculpting

4174
06:29:29,330 --> 06:29:31,090
but they're awful for everything else.

4175
06:29:39,299 --> 06:29:42,900
So I've seen people switch between them.

4176
06:29:44,759 --> 06:29:46,759
Actually switch between them when they sculpt

4177
06:29:46,759 --> 06:29:48,200
they use the move controllers.

4178
06:29:49,889 --> 06:29:51,169
I might just try.

4179
06:29:51,169 --> 06:29:51,569
You know what?

4180
06:29:51,569 --> 06:29:53,250
Why don't we just fucking keep playing it?

4181
06:29:53,250 --> 06:29:53,810
You know what I mean?

4182
06:29:54,849 --> 06:29:57,720
Well, my blood's just beating around the bush

4183
06:29:57,720 --> 06:29:59,080
like I don't know maybe like

4184
06:29:59,080 --> 06:30:00,599
I obviously want to put time into it.

4185
06:30:01,159 --> 06:30:04,319
We'll do it again tomorrow

4186
06:30:04,880 --> 06:30:15,330
because I can't think of anything else

4187
06:30:15,330 --> 06:30:17,889
that I would be doing tomorrow.

4188
06:30:17,889 --> 06:30:19,090
It's Friday, Sam and Max.

4189
06:30:28,069 --> 06:30:29,590
Unless something comes up

4190
06:30:29,590 --> 06:30:30,950
that I know that I would rather do.

4191
06:30:31,590 --> 06:30:37,729
So I do apologize

4192
06:30:37,729 --> 06:30:38,610
if you're one of those people

4193
06:30:38,610 --> 06:30:40,849
that don't really want to watch

4194
06:30:40,849 --> 06:30:41,729
this kind of stream.

4195
06:30:42,450 --> 06:30:43,400
But don't worry.

4196
06:30:44,479 --> 06:30:45,040
Don't worry.

4197
06:30:45,040 --> 06:30:47,040
There's gonna be something fucking crazy

4198
06:30:47,040 --> 06:30:48,400
in like a week or two anyways.

4199
06:30:48,400 --> 06:30:48,959
So don't worry.

4200
06:30:49,759 --> 06:30:56,880
I'm slowly trying to like eat

4201
06:30:57,439 --> 06:30:59,040
and not make a bunch of noises

4202
06:31:04,119 --> 06:31:07,439
but I'm ready to dunk you.

4203
06:31:07,439 --> 06:31:08,240
I hope you are.

4204
06:31:10,560 --> 06:31:11,520
Thank you snoozing copter.

4205
06:31:11,520 --> 06:31:12,400
Thank you daddy.

4206
06:31:15,060 --> 06:31:16,259
I'm just gonna say daddy.

4207
06:31:16,259 --> 06:31:18,500
Thank you daddy for the 15 dollars.

4208
06:31:19,220 --> 06:31:21,599
Thanks for the laughs through the years you goober.

4209
06:31:21,599 --> 06:31:22,560
Thank you daddy.

4210
06:31:25,250 --> 06:31:26,610
You might think it's weird me saying that

4211
06:31:26,610 --> 06:31:27,569
but it would be really weird

4212
06:31:27,569 --> 06:31:28,689
if I said the rest of the name.

4213
06:31:30,630 --> 06:31:34,200
So thank you for the 15 dollars.

4214
06:31:34,200 --> 06:31:35,560
Thank you so much for hanging out here.

4215
06:31:45,639 --> 06:31:46,610
We also had...

4216
06:31:47,330 --> 06:31:50,500
Oh I got cut off here.

4217
06:31:50,500 --> 06:31:52,020
Spaghetti thanks for the five dollars.

4218
06:31:52,020 --> 06:31:53,220
Funniest streamer on Twitch.

4219
06:31:53,220 --> 06:31:54,020
Jermafireman.

4220
06:31:54,020 --> 06:31:54,900
I should make fireman.

4221
06:31:55,700 --> 06:31:57,909
I should make like a fireman game.

4222
06:31:58,470 --> 06:32:00,069
Like a volcano of lava.

4223
06:32:00,069 --> 06:32:01,110
I know what I'm doing tomorrow.

4224
06:32:05,220 --> 06:32:06,500
Thanks for the five dollars spaghetti.

4225
06:32:07,299 --> 06:32:08,740
The Jack thanks for the five dollars.

4226
06:32:09,380 --> 06:32:10,740
I want to take a screenshot

4227
06:32:10,740 --> 06:32:12,180
print it out and hang this on my fridge.

4228
06:32:12,180 --> 06:32:13,860
I'm enjoying your child finger painting

4229
06:32:13,860 --> 06:32:14,740
in 3D stream.

4230
06:32:15,619 --> 06:32:19,599
Well thank you.

4231
06:32:24,549 --> 06:32:26,470
Thank you demonic cucumber for the 250.

4232
06:32:27,110 --> 06:32:28,549
This stream is just the writing

4233
06:32:28,549 --> 06:32:30,950
my sci-fi post-apocalyptic novel

4234
06:32:30,950 --> 06:32:33,990
silence is appreciated joke for five hours.

4235
06:32:38,520 --> 06:32:41,759
But I know but it's like I...

4236
06:32:50,580 --> 06:32:52,180
Do I have to lash out again?

4237
06:32:52,819 --> 06:32:54,259
You're gonna make me lash out again?

4238
06:33:00,340 --> 06:33:01,299
I lashed out.

4239
06:33:01,299 --> 06:33:01,619
I did.

4240
06:33:03,169 --> 06:33:05,009
I put up the shield and I defended myself.

4241
06:33:09,779 --> 06:33:11,619
I was like shut the fuck up!

4242
06:33:12,180 --> 06:33:12,819
Shut up!

4243
06:33:14,130 --> 06:33:14,689
What'd you say?

4244
06:33:14,689 --> 06:33:15,409
What'd you say to me?

4245
06:33:16,950 --> 06:33:18,069
For like an hour straight.

4246
06:33:23,200 --> 06:33:25,279
And then I just I got I got confused.

4247
06:33:25,279 --> 06:33:26,159
I was looking at a mirror

4248
06:33:27,759 --> 06:33:30,959
and then I went on to talk to um chat.

4249
06:33:30,959 --> 06:33:34,240
It was like oh anyways um yeah you guys

4250
06:33:34,240 --> 06:33:35,439
I'm really trying to work on

4251
06:33:35,439 --> 06:33:36,959
to be better at dreams and

4252
06:33:37,680 --> 06:33:42,770
don't make me lash out again.

4253
06:33:47,479 --> 06:33:49,080
Was it like the war brand stream?

4254
06:33:49,080 --> 06:33:50,279
No no no no.

4255
06:33:51,939 --> 06:33:54,419
There was just a certain percentage of people

4256
06:33:54,419 --> 06:33:56,419
that didn't want to watch me do this

4257
06:33:57,299 --> 06:33:59,009
and I said

4258
06:34:01,490 --> 06:34:08,639
okay and that was it.

4259
06:34:19,459 --> 06:34:21,029
But no.

4260
06:34:21,029 --> 06:34:21,509
I kid.

4261
06:34:22,720 --> 06:34:23,759
Thank you for the 250.

4262
06:34:26,849 --> 06:34:28,529
Thank you to Smotherum.

4263
06:34:29,490 --> 06:34:31,250
This is 50 dollars from Smotherum.

4264
06:34:31,970 --> 06:34:38,709
I missed 50 dollars.

4265
06:34:38,709 --> 06:34:40,310
5,000 bits from Smotherum.

4266
06:34:44,159 --> 06:34:46,479
Your lake seems to have many layers

4267
06:34:46,479 --> 06:34:47,520
Mr. Jermis Sir.

4268
06:34:48,319 --> 06:34:51,009
Your lake seems to have many a layer.

4269
06:34:53,889 --> 06:34:54,290
It did.

4270
06:34:54,930 --> 06:34:59,060
Did I have too many layers?

4271
06:35:00,020 --> 06:35:03,430
Thank you for the 50 dollars.

4272
06:35:03,430 --> 06:35:04,549
That's an insane amount of money.

4273
06:35:04,549 --> 06:35:04,869
Thank you.

4274
06:35:05,509 --> 06:35:06,630
Freudian weapon.

4275
06:35:06,630 --> 06:35:07,590
Thanks for the 250.

4276
06:35:08,229 --> 06:35:09,650
That's quite the masterpiece

4277
06:35:09,650 --> 06:35:10,049
you're making.

4278
06:35:10,049 --> 06:35:10,689
Nicely done.

4279
06:35:11,880 --> 06:35:12,439
Practicing.

4280
06:35:13,700 --> 06:35:14,259
Daddio.

4281
06:35:14,259 --> 06:35:15,459
Thanks for the 10 bucks Daddio.

4282
06:35:16,720 --> 06:35:17,599
10 dollars from Daddio.

4283
06:35:17,599 --> 06:35:19,439
Anything I can do to help you through art school.

4284
06:35:20,500 --> 06:35:21,060
Hey thanks.

4285
06:35:27,400 --> 06:35:28,200
Future gamer.

4286
06:35:28,200 --> 06:35:29,240
Thanks for the 250.

4287
06:35:29,799 --> 06:35:32,000
I had a dream that involved you.

4288
06:35:32,639 --> 06:35:36,659
The dream started with me on this huge cube shaped building

4289
06:35:36,659 --> 06:35:38,340
and I decided to enter it.

4290
06:35:38,340 --> 06:35:40,819
I soon found out that I was trapped inside

4291
06:35:40,819 --> 06:35:42,340
so I started looking for an exit.

4292
06:35:42,979 --> 06:35:46,020
I somehow knew that the very center of the building had horses

4293
06:35:46,580 --> 06:35:48,740
and horses would help me escape so I head there.

4294
06:35:49,380 --> 06:35:53,779
I was walking and I saw a weird gray slime start flowing out of a wall

4295
06:35:54,659 --> 06:35:57,779
and in my head that meant that a monster was nearby.

4296
06:35:57,779 --> 06:35:59,459
I grabbed an axe and killed it.

4297
06:36:00,340 --> 06:36:01,220
I kept going.

4298
06:36:01,220 --> 06:36:04,099
It was at this point of the dream that I found my actual house.

4299
06:36:04,099 --> 06:36:07,299
I went to my bedroom and went on Twitch to watch you stream.

4300
06:36:07,299 --> 06:36:09,860
You were making your way through the same cube shaped building

4301
06:36:09,860 --> 06:36:11,459
trying to find the horses.

4302
06:36:11,459 --> 06:36:14,740
People in chat were all arguing in caps about how there were no horses

4303
06:36:14,740 --> 06:36:16,580
and that you were going the wrong way.

4304
06:36:16,580 --> 06:36:18,740
I turned off the stream and tried to sleep

4305
06:36:18,740 --> 06:36:21,700
but I was too scared that a monster was going to enter my room.

4306
06:36:21,700 --> 06:36:24,500
I just sort of ended up in my bathroom and took a bath.

4307
06:36:25,220 --> 06:36:29,139
I was just relaxing in my bathtub trying not to freak out from possible monsters.

4308
06:36:29,779 --> 06:36:32,979
All of a sudden more of that gray slime burst out of the faucet

4309
06:36:32,979 --> 06:36:34,900
and it got all over me and into my mouth.

4310
06:36:35,459 --> 06:36:37,220
I was trying to claw my way out of the bath

4311
06:36:37,220 --> 06:36:39,220
but it was too slippery and I could not leave.

4312
06:36:40,020 --> 06:36:41,220
This is when the dream ended.

4313
06:36:41,220 --> 06:36:42,099
Interpret this please.

4314
06:36:48,549 --> 06:36:50,639
I don't know.

4315
06:36:50,639 --> 06:36:52,319
The gray slime is maybe...

4316
06:36:52,319 --> 06:36:52,799
I don't know.

4317
06:36:57,959 --> 06:36:59,240
Why do I need to interpret that?

4318
06:36:59,240 --> 06:37:01,159
The only thing that I had to do with that

4319
06:37:01,799 --> 06:37:04,680
was you happened to watch my stream for five seconds.

4320
06:37:06,209 --> 06:37:08,529
You got like gray slime going into your mouth.

4321
06:37:08,529 --> 06:37:09,729
I have nothing to do with that.

4322
06:37:09,729 --> 06:37:11,330
You just watched me on camera.

4323
06:37:11,330 --> 06:37:12,369
You just watched my stream.

4324
06:37:21,270 --> 06:37:23,189
No horses thing fucking killed me.

4325
06:37:27,080 --> 06:37:33,720
Well, Future Gamer, that was $7.50 worth of dream.

4326
06:37:35,840 --> 06:37:36,720
I don't know.

4327
06:37:36,720 --> 06:37:40,080
Maybe the gray slime represents something that you're holding back

4328
06:37:40,080 --> 06:37:41,360
or something that you're afraid of

4329
06:37:42,000 --> 06:37:43,279
and you don't want it to catch up with you.

4330
06:37:50,290 --> 06:37:51,169
Make it in dreams.

4331
06:37:51,729 --> 06:37:58,770
You're going the wrong way.

4332
06:37:58,770 --> 06:38:00,130
There are no horses.

4333
06:38:00,130 --> 06:38:01,650
I've seen that already.

4334
06:38:03,779 --> 06:38:05,220
Demoniccucumber, thanks for the 250.

4335
06:38:05,220 --> 06:38:07,860
Welcome back to the German 95 Conspiracy Corner.

4336
06:38:07,860 --> 06:38:11,060
Today we're going to explore theories of italics being the man behind the mask.

4337
06:38:11,139 --> 06:38:13,779
After Germa's death in January, the Phantom of the Germopera.

4338
06:38:15,299 --> 06:38:17,700
Here it's important to...

4339
06:38:19,299 --> 06:38:23,119
All right, dude, this is freaking me out.

4340
06:38:28,950 --> 06:38:30,389
I think it just blue-screened my computer.

4341
06:38:31,029 --> 06:38:38,630
I don't even know what to say about that.

4342
06:38:38,630 --> 06:38:40,229
That's absolutely strange.

4343
06:38:41,270 --> 06:38:43,590
It's important to note that italics has a history of faking appearances

4344
06:38:43,590 --> 06:38:44,790
and had plenty of time to prepare.

4345
06:38:45,430 --> 06:38:46,869
Besides, Germa's death is canon.

4346
06:38:46,869 --> 06:38:47,509
I checked the wiki.

4347
06:38:47,509 --> 06:38:50,470
Join us next time as we explore the mysterious disappearance of Shito

4348
06:38:50,470 --> 06:38:51,909
and its dastardly cover-up.

4349
06:38:53,220 --> 06:38:53,720
Oh.

4350
06:38:54,740 --> 06:38:55,459
The disappearance.

4351
06:38:57,409 --> 06:39:01,939
You mean of this guy?

4352
06:39:03,270 --> 06:39:03,830
Disappeared.

4353
06:39:04,849 --> 06:39:05,409
Disappeared.

4354
06:39:05,970 --> 06:39:14,200
It's just fine.

4355
06:39:14,200 --> 06:39:17,720
Uh, Great Lord Walden gave 40 community subs an absolute shitload.

4356
06:39:17,720 --> 06:39:18,360
Thank you so much.

4357
06:39:20,279 --> 06:39:21,959
That is a lot of community subs.

4358
06:39:25,240 --> 06:39:27,240
And speaking of them, why don't we take a look at them all?

4359
06:39:27,240 --> 06:39:27,799
Fly by.

4360
06:39:31,720 --> 06:39:34,040
Thank you for your incredible generosity, everybody.

4361
06:39:35,330 --> 06:39:37,569
And your support of this channel.

4362
06:39:40,040 --> 06:39:41,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4363
06:39:46,799 --> 06:39:47,680
Gunther.

4364
06:39:47,680 --> 06:39:49,040
Thank you, Gunther, for the three dollars.

4365
06:39:49,040 --> 06:39:49,680
Bits to go.

4366
06:39:50,799 --> 06:39:52,880
1060 bits to go till I get the hexagon.

4367
06:39:52,880 --> 06:39:54,400
Been a while since I've been able to donate or sub,

4368
06:39:54,400 --> 06:39:56,159
but I'm making money again, baby.

4369
06:39:57,380 --> 06:39:58,259
Glad you're making some money.

4370
06:39:58,979 --> 06:40:00,319
Thank you for the three dollars.

4371
06:40:03,729 --> 06:40:04,930
Really appreciate it.

4372
06:40:04,930 --> 06:40:06,369
Congratulations on making some money.

4373
06:40:10,689 --> 06:40:12,869
Thank you.

4374
06:40:12,869 --> 06:40:13,509
MultiTrip.

4375
06:40:13,509 --> 06:40:14,950
Ten dollars for MultiTrip.

4376
06:40:14,950 --> 06:40:16,790
Don't worry about dreams being tough to learn.

4377
06:40:16,790 --> 06:40:18,310
I know how to 3D model and draw,

4378
06:40:18,310 --> 06:40:21,669
and I still couldn't get past the bad controls to make something for today.

4379
06:40:28,080 --> 06:40:33,040
Well, it's just really...

4380
06:40:33,840 --> 06:40:37,330
Your brain kind of hits a wall when you sculpt.

4381
06:40:37,970 --> 06:40:42,040
But I do appreciate the effort.

4382
06:40:42,930 --> 06:40:43,810
I think it's a great game.

4383
06:40:44,369 --> 06:40:47,540
I just, like we were saying a few hours ago,

4384
06:40:48,959 --> 06:40:51,119
I don't know what the target audience is.

4385
06:40:51,119 --> 06:40:52,080
I don't know where they're going with it.

4386
06:40:54,900 --> 06:40:59,380
It's kind of too hard to have anybody care about it for like a few hours a week.

4387
06:41:00,709 --> 06:41:03,909
And it's not unity or unreal.

4388
06:41:08,069 --> 06:41:09,830
It kind of sits in this weird place

4389
06:41:09,830 --> 06:41:12,790
where it's so elaborate and has so much shit you can do

4390
06:41:12,790 --> 06:41:14,709
that it's almost too much stuff you can do

4391
06:41:14,709 --> 06:41:17,189
to the point where I don't know if anyone's going to use it.

4392
06:41:17,909 --> 06:41:24,659
The controls really aren't that bad.

4393
06:41:24,659 --> 06:41:27,139
They're just very different than anything that's been done with a controller.

4394
06:41:29,459 --> 06:41:30,580
Yeah, I mean, that's true.

4395
06:41:31,459 --> 06:41:35,680
I think it's supposed to be aimed for everyone,

4396
06:41:35,680 --> 06:41:38,479
but the learning curve is really steep, but it offers so much.

4397
06:41:39,439 --> 06:41:47,669
It's a lot of tools in one.

4398
06:41:47,669 --> 06:41:49,830
It's a lot more fun to use than a usual game engine.

4399
06:41:49,830 --> 06:41:51,970
Yeah, that's also true.

4400
06:41:52,610 --> 06:41:57,990
Because I definitely found myself getting frustrated.

4401
06:41:59,040 --> 06:42:03,360
And obviously, I know I'm not an artistically-inclined person.

4402
06:42:04,240 --> 06:42:07,009
There's some people that are wonderful and can sculpt.

4403
06:42:07,650 --> 06:42:11,090
But for somebody that is not artistically-inclined

4404
06:42:11,090 --> 06:42:12,930
in the traditional sense, I guess,

4405
06:42:13,970 --> 06:42:15,889
it's frustrating to use those controllers.

4406
06:42:17,409 --> 06:42:18,529
I'm going to try to use...

4407
06:42:20,130 --> 06:42:20,930
I'm going to go for it.

4408
06:42:20,930 --> 06:42:22,529
I'm going to get up early tomorrow.

4409
06:42:22,529 --> 06:42:24,209
I'm going to go get a PlayStation camera.

4410
06:42:24,770 --> 06:42:26,049
I have my Move controllers.

4411
06:42:26,049 --> 06:42:27,330
I'm going to try to use them.

4412
06:42:28,290 --> 06:42:30,400
And we'll see if they make a difference.

4413
06:42:40,450 --> 06:42:41,490
Mad because bad.

4414
06:42:43,569 --> 06:42:46,439
You'd be amazed how nice sculpting is with the sticks.

4415
06:42:46,439 --> 06:42:48,119
I'm looking forward to it because it was...

4416
06:42:49,720 --> 06:42:53,479
I could feel myself getting just really frustrated.

4417
06:42:54,119 --> 06:42:57,909
And I don't want to, you know, do that on stream.

4418
06:42:57,909 --> 06:42:59,669
I don't want to be like, yeah, I don't like this.

4419
06:42:59,669 --> 06:43:00,389
Dumb. Sucks.

4420
06:43:00,950 --> 06:43:02,740
I don't like being that guy.

4421
06:43:02,740 --> 06:43:08,680
So I'm going to make a Trainwreck Scorpion Boss ice cream.

4422
06:43:08,680 --> 06:43:09,159
No, I'm not.

4423
06:43:12,180 --> 06:43:14,180
We're going to make a platformer tomorrow.

4424
06:43:14,180 --> 06:43:18,549
I'm going to make a...

4425
06:43:18,549 --> 06:43:20,229
I'm going to just make a big space.

4426
06:43:20,869 --> 06:43:22,549
Cubes and platforms.

4427
06:43:22,549 --> 06:43:23,349
I'm just going to try it.

4428
06:43:24,150 --> 06:43:31,959
I told you we're going to make a fireman platform.

4429
06:43:31,959 --> 06:43:33,000
We're going to make fireman first.

4430
06:43:34,979 --> 06:43:36,419
We're going to bring in some assets, too.

4431
06:43:36,419 --> 06:43:37,939
I'm not going to make everything from scratch.

4432
06:43:37,939 --> 06:43:38,659
Nobody does that.

4433
06:43:39,459 --> 06:43:43,409
Except for the talented people, you know, talented people do that.

4434
06:43:44,290 --> 06:43:49,919
Is it going to be a story?

4435
06:43:50,479 --> 06:43:53,599
I don't know if I'm that well-versed to make a story.

4436
06:43:54,319 --> 06:44:02,529
Would you mind tweeting out about the dunk tank stream when it comes around?

4437
06:44:02,529 --> 06:44:05,330
Oh, you will know where very much in advance.

4438
06:44:07,990 --> 06:44:10,549
That's going to have a set date and a set time.

4439
06:44:11,270 --> 06:44:13,110
At least a week before it happens.

4440
06:44:13,110 --> 06:44:13,750
So don't worry.

4441
06:44:14,709 --> 06:44:22,529
In a few months, you're going to be making games.

4442
06:44:25,619 --> 06:44:28,020
Well, that's one of the reasons why I got, like,

4443
06:44:29,430 --> 06:44:32,150
pissy pants over the things people were saying in chat today.

4444
06:44:33,029 --> 06:44:35,590
Well, not really, but it's because I...

4445
06:44:35,590 --> 06:44:35,909
All right.

4446
06:44:36,790 --> 06:44:38,709
To be able to make something, I need to spend time in it.

4447
06:44:38,709 --> 06:44:42,389
To spend time in it, I have to put the hours in to be here.

4448
06:44:42,389 --> 06:44:44,549
To put the hours in, I need to do it on stream

4449
06:44:44,549 --> 06:44:46,470
because I can't really do it off stream.

4450
06:44:46,549 --> 06:44:48,869
So it's almost like the cycle of...

4451
06:44:49,590 --> 06:44:53,110
It's either stream me learning it or don't,

4452
06:44:53,110 --> 06:44:56,229
and just spend 10 hours a day learning it for, like, two weeks.

4453
06:45:02,919 --> 06:45:05,159
It's kind of a rock-and-a-hard place in that scenario.

4454
06:45:15,700 --> 06:45:18,020
And I figure, I mean, if I'm going to try,

4455
06:45:18,020 --> 06:45:18,900
I might as well stream it.

4456
06:45:18,900 --> 06:45:20,419
Otherwise, I'm just going to do it off stream.

4457
06:45:21,299 --> 06:45:23,590
At the same time, it's hard to please everyone.

4458
06:45:24,229 --> 06:45:25,349
Yeah, but I know that.

4459
06:45:25,349 --> 06:45:28,470
And look, I was not that angry today.

4460
06:45:29,560 --> 06:45:30,279
Not even close.

4461
06:45:31,000 --> 06:45:33,959
At least you don't sometimes want to, you know,

4462
06:45:33,959 --> 06:45:35,560
see, tell people where I'm coming from.

4463
06:45:35,560 --> 06:45:37,400
You know, that's my side of the story.

4464
06:45:43,189 --> 06:45:53,409
This game definitely has potential.

4465
06:45:55,250 --> 06:45:58,319
It does.

4466
06:46:04,290 --> 06:46:05,009
But I'm going to...

4467
06:46:05,810 --> 06:46:09,439
I wonder if I can go get the camera now.

4468
06:46:09,439 --> 06:46:10,720
Is anything open in...

4469
06:46:10,720 --> 06:46:12,240
I mean, I live in Las Vegas.

4470
06:46:13,330 --> 06:46:14,290
Everything's fucking open.

4471
06:46:18,950 --> 06:46:20,630
That ice technique was really nice.

4472
06:46:22,450 --> 06:46:24,610
It's fun to have your Rika moments and just do it.

4473
06:46:25,169 --> 06:46:28,770
I just wish I knew more and knew about where things should be

4474
06:46:28,770 --> 06:46:29,490
and how to do them.

4475
06:46:29,970 --> 06:46:32,209
It's funny because if you give me 3D movie maker right now,

4476
06:46:33,009 --> 06:46:35,810
I could show you every fucking little technique,

4477
06:46:35,810 --> 06:46:37,090
every tiny little thing.

4478
06:46:39,919 --> 06:46:41,200
Weird workarounds.

4479
06:46:41,200 --> 06:46:43,360
And I will never forget that stuff.

4480
06:46:43,360 --> 06:46:44,319
It's burned in my brain forever.

4481
06:46:52,819 --> 06:46:55,959
I feel like some people think every stream has to be

4482
06:46:55,959 --> 06:46:57,959
a high energy clown comedy stream.

4483
06:47:02,319 --> 06:47:05,279
Yeah, but that's kind of my fault, though.

4484
06:47:05,279 --> 06:47:05,919
You know what I mean?

4485
06:47:05,919 --> 06:47:07,759
Like, I do these...

4486
06:47:08,959 --> 06:47:11,680
A lot of my streams are like fucking high energy

4487
06:47:11,680 --> 06:47:13,279
fucking clown comedy streams.

4488
06:47:14,000 --> 06:47:15,360
So I can understand when people come here

4489
06:47:15,360 --> 06:47:16,080
and they're like, wait, he's...

4490
06:47:17,119 --> 06:47:18,799
He's just going to play Dreams?

4491
06:47:19,520 --> 06:47:21,119
And he's going to just sculpt?

4492
06:47:22,930 --> 06:47:23,169
Why?

4493
06:47:23,970 --> 06:47:26,069
Where's like the car crash?

4494
06:47:26,790 --> 06:47:29,700
A lot of that's my own doing, right?

4495
06:47:30,419 --> 06:47:39,040
Wouldn't blame you.

4496
06:47:39,040 --> 06:47:40,000
No, and I'm not...

4497
06:47:40,959 --> 06:47:43,840
I'm really not trying to make this some kind of

4498
06:47:45,159 --> 06:47:46,279
thing about, well, you know,

4499
06:47:46,279 --> 06:47:48,680
I really wish I could do this and not have to work.

4500
06:47:49,319 --> 06:47:49,959
No, it's all good.

4501
06:47:52,040 --> 06:47:52,759
I was not...

4502
06:47:53,560 --> 06:47:56,599
I'm kind of making this more of a bigger deal than it was today.

4503
06:47:56,599 --> 06:47:57,720
It just wasn't at all.

4504
06:47:58,599 --> 06:48:02,229
I mentioned it for like maybe 30 seconds.

4505
06:48:06,720 --> 06:48:09,680
You set the bar too high with the scorpion battle.

4506
06:48:09,680 --> 06:48:11,279
Should I have not pulled that out so quickly?

4507
06:48:11,279 --> 06:48:11,840
Because then I went...

4508
06:48:11,840 --> 06:48:12,319
Yeah, you know what?

4509
06:48:12,319 --> 06:48:14,080
I went from that to just like making a mountain.

4510
06:48:18,659 --> 06:48:19,060
I just...

4511
06:48:19,060 --> 06:48:21,459
Yeah, I went from that to snow covered mountain.

4512
06:48:34,470 --> 06:48:37,680
You started with the main event.

4513
06:48:38,659 --> 06:48:42,500
Yeah, but I wanted you to see what I did.

4514
06:48:48,529 --> 06:48:51,009
You gave them Hogan versus Andre first.

4515
06:48:51,729 --> 06:48:53,990
Yeah, but do you think...

4516
06:48:53,990 --> 06:48:55,830
All right, do you think anyone would have stuck around

4517
06:48:55,830 --> 06:48:59,909
if I started with the snow covered mountains?

4518
06:49:01,409 --> 06:49:04,529
No, people could see the potential with the scorpion boss battle.

4519
06:49:04,529 --> 06:49:08,049
They know, holy shit, this isn't just a snow covered mountain stream.

4520
06:49:08,689 --> 06:49:21,970
You know, content creation is hard.

4521
06:49:21,970 --> 06:49:23,090
You never know what to start with.

4522
06:49:23,650 --> 06:49:25,919
Start with a beetle battle.

4523
06:49:25,919 --> 06:49:26,560
You know what?

4524
06:49:26,560 --> 06:49:27,439
Maybe I'll just stay...

4525
06:49:27,439 --> 06:49:27,759
I don't know.

4526
06:49:27,759 --> 06:49:30,500
Maybe I'll just be a psycho.

4527
06:49:33,270 --> 06:49:34,790
I said this last time, but I might...

4528
06:49:34,790 --> 06:49:36,150
Maybe I'll just be a psycho tonight

4529
06:49:36,150 --> 06:49:37,590
and I'll just make a bunch of stuff tonight.

4530
06:49:45,159 --> 06:49:45,880
And then just...

4531
06:49:45,880 --> 06:49:47,400
I'm streaming early tomorrow.

4532
06:49:52,240 --> 06:49:52,639
Maybe.

4533
06:49:58,340 --> 06:49:59,380
No, but then I got to like...

4534
06:49:59,380 --> 06:50:00,740
I got to go.

4535
06:50:00,740 --> 06:50:07,040
I have to like drive, so I can't do that.

4536
06:50:07,040 --> 06:50:08,479
No, I don't want to like...

4537
06:50:08,479 --> 06:50:09,439
No, that's not a good idea.

4538
06:50:10,240 --> 06:50:14,200
What's tomorrow?

4539
06:50:14,200 --> 06:50:15,799
Tomorrow is an early stream.

4540
06:50:15,799 --> 06:50:18,759
And then I have to take Otto to the bed.

4541
06:50:19,319 --> 06:50:27,439
So we're going to go for like six hours before five.

4542
06:50:31,750 --> 06:50:34,150
But let's finish up the bits.

4543
06:50:34,150 --> 06:50:35,029
We're at the end here.

4544
06:50:37,080 --> 06:50:38,919
The bala koala gave $14.

4545
06:50:38,919 --> 06:50:40,119
Dude, stop looking for horses.

4546
06:50:40,119 --> 06:50:41,080
There are no horses.

4547
06:50:41,080 --> 06:50:41,720
Fail fish.

4548
06:50:43,729 --> 06:50:44,049
Shut up.

4549
06:50:44,049 --> 06:50:44,529
Yes, there are.

4550
06:50:45,250 --> 06:50:48,610
Thank you for the $14, bala koala.

4551
06:50:48,610 --> 06:50:50,930
Thank you Sikilos for the five bucks.

4552
06:50:51,810 --> 06:50:54,689
Jerma, would you mind tweeting out info about the dunk tank stream?

4553
06:50:54,689 --> 06:50:55,090
This is...

4554
06:50:55,090 --> 06:50:55,970
We caught that earlier.

4555
06:50:56,849 --> 06:50:57,409
Yes, yes.

4556
06:50:58,049 --> 06:51:00,529
My friends and I want to plan a big watch party for it.

4557
06:51:00,529 --> 06:51:02,529
Well, it's not going to be like next week.

4558
06:51:03,490 --> 06:51:05,009
I will give you at least one week notice.

4559
06:51:05,970 --> 06:51:09,330
I'm like trying to prod every single resource here

4560
06:51:09,889 --> 06:51:12,049
to get this going in the next couple weeks.

4561
06:51:16,319 --> 06:51:19,439
If that goes well, that stream is going to be a ton of fucking fun.

4562
06:51:19,439 --> 06:51:27,569
Am I still live?

4563
06:51:28,290 --> 06:51:29,250
Did we actually turn off?

4564
06:51:29,889 --> 06:51:32,159
I think we may have actually turned off.

4565
06:51:32,799 --> 06:51:36,080
Maybe not.

4566
06:51:36,639 --> 06:51:38,529
I think we're still on.

4567
06:51:41,810 --> 06:51:43,409
But yeah, you will know far in advance.

4568
06:51:43,409 --> 06:51:44,049
I'll tweet about it.

4569
06:51:44,049 --> 06:51:44,849
I'll talk about it.

4570
06:51:44,849 --> 06:51:47,729
And I'll give some actual detail, detailed details

4571
06:51:47,729 --> 06:51:50,310
of how it's going to work when it does happen.

4572
06:51:52,180 --> 06:51:56,020
Hey C2K, thanks for the 10 bucks.

4573
06:51:56,020 --> 06:51:58,979
Hey Jerma, are you ever going to play God of War of the 2018 one?

4574
06:51:59,619 --> 06:52:01,799
I mean, the PlayStation is hooked up right now.

4575
06:52:03,319 --> 06:52:07,939
So maybe I'll just do that after Sam and Max or something.

4576
06:52:11,119 --> 06:52:12,159
Sounds like a fun game.

4577
06:52:12,880 --> 06:52:14,020
It looks amazing.

4578
06:52:16,020 --> 06:52:17,299
Thank you for the $10.

4579
06:52:17,299 --> 06:52:18,900
And yes, I do plan on playing it.

4580
06:52:21,189 --> 06:52:23,349
Hey Mr. Comcast, thanks for the six bucks.

4581
06:52:23,909 --> 06:52:26,099
Are you going to bail me out here, Mr. Comcast?

4582
06:52:26,099 --> 06:52:28,419
Hey Jerma, John Comcast here sitting in my screwed McDuck bank

4583
06:52:28,419 --> 06:52:29,619
while the money got me thinking.

4584
06:52:30,340 --> 06:52:35,090
Well, what if money can't buy us true happiness?

4585
06:52:35,650 --> 06:52:37,250
It's a question that I ponder often

4586
06:52:37,250 --> 06:52:39,090
and I was wondering if you knew the answer.

4587
06:52:39,090 --> 06:52:40,930
Also in other news, can you move the billions

4588
06:52:40,930 --> 06:52:43,569
that are in your overseas Swiss bank account somewhere else?

4589
06:52:43,569 --> 06:52:46,770
You're clogging it up for all of us other rich boomers.

4590
06:52:46,770 --> 06:52:48,369
If you don't move it, I'll be forced to tell people

4591
06:52:48,369 --> 06:52:50,450
about the Ponzi scheme you run on your Twitch stream.

4592
06:52:55,040 --> 06:53:01,939
Sure, well, no, I don't think money buys happiness

4593
06:53:01,939 --> 06:53:03,459
and happiness comes from within.

4594
06:53:05,490 --> 06:53:07,490
Happiness comes from within.

4595
06:53:08,819 --> 06:53:15,750
Happiness comes from within.

4596
06:53:15,750 --> 06:53:19,250
Um, get your fucking money out of my way.

4597
06:53:21,029 --> 06:53:23,430
I got plenty of those bank accounts in mine.

4598
06:53:23,430 --> 06:53:25,909
I've got the paper signed over Mr. John Comcast.

4599
06:53:25,909 --> 06:53:27,270
You ain't going to get your hands on any of it.

4600
06:53:28,069 --> 06:53:35,700
Oh no, it's happiness.

4601
06:53:35,700 --> 06:53:36,340
It's escaping.

4602
06:53:37,060 --> 06:53:48,119
But money can insulate you from exterior factors

4603
06:53:48,119 --> 06:53:49,000
that can make you unhappy.

4604
06:53:49,000 --> 06:53:49,560
That's true.

4605
06:53:50,279 --> 06:53:50,840
That is true.

4606
06:53:51,880 --> 06:53:58,290
But here, you know when you put a,

4607
06:53:58,290 --> 06:53:59,970
you know the whole goldfish in the bowl thing?

4608
06:53:59,970 --> 06:54:01,490
The goldfish just gets bigger,

4609
06:54:01,490 --> 06:54:02,610
the bigger the bowl you put it in.

4610
06:54:08,580 --> 06:54:14,000
It's almost like even if you have a million dollars,

4611
06:54:17,639 --> 06:54:21,569
your life kind of just, that becomes normal.

4612
06:54:23,250 --> 06:54:25,889
And even having a million dollar life,

4613
06:54:25,889 --> 06:54:27,250
like a multi-million dollar life,

4614
06:54:27,970 --> 06:54:30,849
cannot like buy you love.

4615
06:54:31,810 --> 06:54:32,369
It can't.

4616
06:54:33,090 --> 06:54:34,290
Oh, did we get cut off?

4617
06:54:35,169 --> 06:54:40,130
I think I was about to say something really, really important.

4618
06:54:42,630 --> 06:54:43,830
What the fuck is going on?

4619
06:54:45,479 --> 06:54:47,479
It hasn't been this bad in like months.

4620
06:54:54,799 --> 06:54:57,279
Well, I did not expect it to be this bad tonight.

4621
06:54:58,849 --> 06:55:12,099
Um, well, okay.

4622
06:55:12,740 --> 06:55:15,720
You got it out of your system now?

4623
06:55:15,720 --> 06:55:16,680
You're going to keep doing it?

4624
06:55:16,680 --> 06:55:18,439
You're going to keep cutting me off or what?

4625
06:55:22,900 --> 06:55:24,659
Money could buy some better internet.

4626
06:55:24,659 --> 06:55:39,090
You think that would be true, but it's not true.

4627
06:55:39,090 --> 06:55:43,799
Uh, what was I saying?

4628
06:55:44,520 --> 06:55:49,400
I sure would love to tell you what I was saying.

4629
06:55:50,200 --> 06:55:58,529
Oh God, it went down to zero again.

4630
06:56:02,689 --> 06:56:03,729
What the fuck?

4631
06:56:13,590 --> 06:56:15,830
You know, I'm, I'm just going to type it.

4632
06:56:15,830 --> 06:56:21,000
I'm, I'm going to type it because I can't say it.

4633
06:57:35,169 --> 06:57:48,689
Okay, got it done.

4634
06:57:48,689 --> 06:57:49,889
Okay. Can I, can you hear me?

4635
06:57:57,619 --> 06:57:58,900
That's a new coffee.

4636
06:57:58,900 --> 06:57:59,939
Okay. All right.

4637
06:57:59,939 --> 06:58:01,939
No, I think, I think I can speak again.

4638
06:58:05,509 --> 06:58:11,080
So yes, money alleviates the burdens of life to have a comfortable life,

4639
06:58:11,080 --> 06:58:13,080
but it cannot put people in it.

4640
06:58:13,080 --> 06:58:18,759
And as humans, we strive and we long for true friendship,

4641
06:58:18,759 --> 06:58:21,479
true love and things to share with other people.

4642
06:58:22,279 --> 06:58:23,000
We long for it.

4643
06:58:23,000 --> 06:58:23,479
We want it.

4644
06:58:24,119 --> 06:58:25,479
You can't buy it.

4645
06:58:25,479 --> 06:58:30,599
You can buy, you can buy pretend, but not the real thing.

4646
06:58:30,599 --> 06:58:31,720
And we all want the real thing.

4647
06:58:32,279 --> 06:58:37,029
So, you know, you could have $5,000 in your checking account.

4648
06:58:37,029 --> 06:58:39,669
You could have $5 million in your checking account.

4649
06:58:39,669 --> 06:58:44,869
The $5,000 checking account person may have a ton of fucking great friends

4650
06:58:45,430 --> 06:58:48,150
and a bunch of wonderful people in their life.

4651
06:58:48,150 --> 06:58:51,909
Somebody that they love and they just live their life.

4652
06:58:51,909 --> 06:58:55,189
The person with the $5 million might have,

4653
06:58:55,189 --> 06:58:57,990
might pay for a bunch of shit and might own a bunch of cool stuff,

4654
06:58:57,990 --> 06:58:59,590
but they might not have anybody to share it with.

4655
06:59:00,549 --> 06:59:02,790
Or the people that they are sharing it with might,

4656
06:59:02,790 --> 06:59:04,069
they might not have a true connection.

4657
06:59:09,400 --> 06:59:11,799
I know this because I have $4 million in my bank account

4658
06:59:11,799 --> 06:59:13,560
and everybody fucking hates my guts.

4659
06:59:13,560 --> 06:59:14,520
Nobody likes me.

4660
06:59:14,520 --> 06:59:15,639
No, I'm just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

4661
06:59:16,520 --> 06:59:19,080
I would, I don't have that much money.

4662
06:59:24,099 --> 06:59:28,659
I do not have even remotely a percentage of that.

4663
06:59:29,299 --> 06:59:33,700
That's not water.

4664
06:59:33,700 --> 06:59:35,380
It's a seltzer water, relax.

4665
06:59:38,020 --> 06:59:48,259
But no, I'm a firm believer of the only reason why you really do anything at all

4666
06:59:49,970 --> 06:59:55,009
is because it's somehow some way you want to share it with someone.

4667
06:59:55,889 --> 06:59:58,240
You know, oh, I want to go out.

4668
06:59:58,240 --> 06:59:59,599
I want to go out to dinner tonight.

4669
06:59:59,599 --> 07:00:00,560
I want to go out to dinner.

4670
07:00:00,560 --> 07:00:01,060
Why?

4671
07:00:01,439 --> 07:00:03,040
Well, because I like this restaurant.

4672
07:00:03,040 --> 07:00:04,479
But why do you want to go to that restaurant?

4673
07:00:05,279 --> 07:00:06,479
Because they have good food?

4674
07:00:07,279 --> 07:00:07,840
Anything else?

4675
07:00:09,240 --> 07:00:10,919
Uh, well, hold on.

4676
07:00:10,919 --> 07:00:11,639
I went to zero.

4677
07:00:12,360 --> 07:00:17,060
No, we're back.

4678
07:00:17,060 --> 07:00:17,560
Okay.

4679
07:00:20,689 --> 07:00:24,369
But whenever you go deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, and you think about it,

4680
07:00:25,569 --> 07:00:29,729
you want to go to that nice restaurant with somebody

4681
07:00:29,729 --> 07:00:32,610
so you can experience the food together so you can...

4682
07:00:33,729 --> 07:00:35,330
It's like this human thing.

4683
07:00:36,049 --> 07:00:39,810
I want to go to the restaurant because, oh, hey, how is that?

4684
07:00:39,810 --> 07:00:42,209
Is that, is that, is the pasta good?

4685
07:00:42,770 --> 07:00:43,569
It is good.

4686
07:00:43,569 --> 07:00:45,009
Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

4687
07:00:45,250 --> 07:00:46,049
I got the chicken.

4688
07:00:46,049 --> 07:00:46,770
Oh, it's amazing.

4689
07:00:46,770 --> 07:00:47,270
You want to try?

4690
07:00:49,840 --> 07:00:50,959
Yeah, no, it's really good.

4691
07:00:50,959 --> 07:00:52,080
Yeah, try it, try it.

4692
07:00:52,080 --> 07:00:54,959
Yeah, I really like that wine that they were serving.

4693
07:00:54,959 --> 07:00:56,000
It was really good wine, wasn't it?

4694
07:00:59,810 --> 07:01:01,009
Experiences with other people.

4695
07:01:10,549 --> 07:01:14,599
And they don't all have to be at like a restaurant.

4696
07:01:14,599 --> 07:01:17,650
There are plenty of, you know, does it cost?

4697
07:01:17,650 --> 07:01:21,970
I mean, of course it costs something to, you know, use the internet.

4698
07:01:22,689 --> 07:01:25,970
But I know a lot of people that have a bunch of friends that are online

4699
07:01:25,970 --> 07:01:29,569
that they've met through, you know, playing video games.

4700
07:01:29,569 --> 07:01:30,849
And look at half of the people that I know.

4701
07:01:32,049 --> 07:01:33,810
The connections that I've made with people

4702
07:01:34,529 --> 07:01:36,450
because we were making YouTube videos and shit.

4703
07:01:40,080 --> 07:01:42,799
I think, I think it's nothing to do with money.

4704
07:01:42,799 --> 07:01:45,599
It has to do with having experiences with other people that you like.

4705
07:01:48,599 --> 07:01:51,799
Unless you go to a 3D movie by yourself, which is fine.

4706
07:01:52,599 --> 07:01:53,080
I did it.

4707
07:01:54,560 --> 07:01:55,919
And you're the only person in the theater

4708
07:01:55,919 --> 07:01:58,720
and you get to experience the 3D movie alone.

4709
07:01:58,720 --> 07:02:00,319
It was fucking cool and it was great.

4710
07:02:01,119 --> 07:02:11,700
And experience like a cooking stream.

4711
07:02:18,950 --> 07:02:22,979
But that's not all about the dollar.

4712
07:02:23,619 --> 07:02:28,279
There are plenty of people that are not happy with lots of money.

4713
07:02:28,279 --> 07:02:30,439
And there are plenty of people that aren't happy that don't have money.

4714
07:02:30,439 --> 07:02:33,000
There are plenty of people that are really happy that don't have a lot of money.

4715
07:02:33,639 --> 07:02:34,680
It's just who the person is.

4716
07:02:36,580 --> 07:02:41,860
And I'm like, I'm not going to pretend like, no, it's money doesn't do it.

4717
07:02:41,860 --> 07:02:42,819
Money does a lot.

4718
07:02:42,819 --> 07:02:43,220
It does.

4719
07:02:44,869 --> 07:02:48,389
But it will not fill the human connection.

4720
07:02:48,389 --> 07:02:53,220
And with that, that's my talk.

4721
07:02:53,220 --> 07:02:55,860
And I will see you guys tomorrow afternoon, early this time.

4722
07:02:55,860 --> 07:02:56,740
Make sure you get up.

4723
07:02:57,619 --> 07:02:59,060
We've got some stuff to do.

4724
07:03:04,520 --> 07:03:06,520
Which WWE game is the best 2K14?

4725
07:03:07,669 --> 07:03:09,189
The rest are terrible.

4726
07:03:09,189 --> 07:03:13,029
2K, well, 2K13, 2K12.

4727
07:03:13,029 --> 07:03:14,310
Okay, maybe they're pretty good.

4728
07:03:15,110 --> 07:03:16,630
Everything after 2K14 is awful.

4729
07:03:20,520 --> 07:03:21,319
There it is.

4730
07:03:21,319 --> 07:03:22,930
Have a good night.

4731
07:03:22,930 --> 07:03:24,689
I will hopefully have an internet that works tomorrow.

4732
07:03:24,689 --> 07:03:25,169
That'd be great.

4733
07:03:25,970 --> 07:03:29,090
And I'll see you guys very soon, actually.

4734
07:03:29,330 --> 07:03:31,330
Less than what?

4735
07:03:31,330 --> 07:03:33,000
Less than 12 hours?

4736
07:03:33,000 --> 07:03:36,439
11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

4737
07:03:36,439 --> 07:03:38,919
Yeah, I'll see you guys in less than 12 to 14 hours.

4738
07:03:39,880 --> 07:03:40,959
Have a great night.

4739
07:03:41,599 --> 07:03:42,799
See you real soon.
