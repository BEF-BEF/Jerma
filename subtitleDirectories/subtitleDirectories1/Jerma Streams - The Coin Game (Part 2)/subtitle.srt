1
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:20,420
Oh, fucking leaked. Oh, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega. He leaked it.

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:35,030
I actually leaked it. Oh, Monka, Omega. He leaked it. Just sitting there. Oops, wrong screen.

3
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,189
Okay, I'll see you later. I'll be back. I gotta have my two minute intro. Hold on.

4
00:00:41,909 --> 00:01:22,390
All right, there we go. That's better. Hi guys, how are you?

5
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:31,780
Okay, welcome. If you probably could guess today, we're going to do the UFO arcade update.

6
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,969
Just dropped a couple weeks ago in the coin game. One of our old favorites from earlier in the year.

7
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,640
Today was mystery stream and there you go, mystery solved. We're going back to coin game.

8
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,969
They've added, this is a pretty significant update. I'm looking at this right now. So

9
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:05,099
they added 15 new games. This is not just two. Oh yeah, we got a new update for you. I don't

10
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,300
like three new games. It's 15. I don't know how different or good or we're going to check it out,

11
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:25,530
but that seems like a lot. Jerma hates me. What are you talking about? I don't. What? Why would

12
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:33,800
I, why did you say that? Bird game two out of 16? Well, no, that's what we're doing. And if there's

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,319
time left over at the end, depending on how long the update takes us to get through, depending how

14
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,419
many prizes I want. And we're also going to play elf bowling because I'm like three people in the

15
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:52,379
pre stream chat wanted me to like that. That's, there's maybe four people in the chat before the

16
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:59,110
stream started. They're like, Hey, play elf bowling Christmas flash game. Cause this is the last stream

17
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:06,699
before Christmas and I'm not streaming on Christmas. So sure. I'll play elf bowling for like 10 minutes

18
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:16,740
Oh, also I want to show you guys the power of the pre stream chat because this mystery was already

19
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,569
solved for people that were here like 30, 40 minutes ago. I'm going to give you a poll.

20
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,539
I'd like you to look at that poll because this is what you could have chosen. I want to see what

21
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:48,780
happens. Please vote for what you think you'd like to see today. Please vote. Let's see what happens.

22
00:03:49,419 --> 00:04:00,900
Oh, it didn't work. Why does that not work? Nothing on this one. How?

23
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:20,100
What I do is how, why is this broken? This is, this is not the poll. This is the poll. Why is this

24
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:29,860
poll being like, it's whatever. Who cares? Point is you could have, there was coin game. There was

25
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,420
GTA five casino update and there was Nancy Drew on here. You could have selected one of those,

26
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:44,730
but they chose coin game update and that's probably what I would have chosen too. So

27
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:53,779
good choice. Let's do it. It's available. It's ready for us right now. I'm ready to get addicted.

28
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:02,279
All right. A bunch of kids just drove by in a bus screaming out the window. That bus was going

29
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:14,420
fast. Slow down. Let's go. Let's go. All right. Here we go. Uh, I think there's a new game mode

30
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:25,240
too. Is there? Oh shit. I have a saved game. Load this one. So we played this in July.

31
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:37,529
Can I do this? Is it? No. Survival mode isn't here yet. This will delete. Yeah. Let's go.

32
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,300
I bought everything here, right? That wasn't that long ago. No, it wasn't.

33
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,930
Felt like a long time ago though. Hey atmosphere, thanks for the five community subs.

34
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,889
No, that was kind of a long time ago, July. It was like five months ago. That's a long time.

35
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:23,100
Are we in? The mouse is wrong too. Yeah, it's fine. Mouse curse is misaligned. It don't matter.

36
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,730
Now it has to be aligned now. All right. How's the audio? I got 96 bucks.

37
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:41,670
Was it UFO? All right. You pawn. Yeah. Okay. I got a hundred. What was my like stats? Happy birthday,

38
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:53,269
kiddo. There it is. The boom box. I spent all five months ago trying to get where to go. Okay.

39
00:06:53,269 --> 00:07:00,089
I just got really scared. Put it in my inventory. It's like throw it in the trash. All right. Let's

40
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:11,060
go to the, you can drive cars, right? Why is the game so slow? Holy shit. Somebody's trying to kill

41
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:22,519
me. Like I am standing in the road. All right. Let's go. Let's go check out the UFO. Wait,

42
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:27,610
I need money. Don't have to call. Why do I have a gun? Oh, right. Okay. It's a rubber band gun.

43
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:42,730
I need money. I gotta call. I gotta call my uncle for money, right? How do I get money? Total money

44
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:52,920
spent. So I spent $41,000. How did I win 80,000? Oh, there's lottery tickets in this game. Holy

45
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:04,500
shit. I forgot. I completely forgot about the lottery tickets. All right. Well, let's go. Let's

46
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I gotta, I, how do I call uncle, uncle Phil? How do I ask for money? I only have $96. That's not

47
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:27,660
enough. I gotta remember how to play. Just fast travel. Can I do it like this? Bus passes. How

48
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:35,190
much is a bus pass? A doll of 50. That's actually not that bad. All right. Where am I going? I want

49
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:49,350
to go to the UFO point one. Click here to purchase. Thank you. Got a bus pass. Now we're going to go to

50
00:08:51,179 --> 00:09:07,750
one. It's very loud. Why is that so loud? And nothing else is. Sound effects. All right. That's

51
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:18,259
probably better. Here comes a bus. How do we, uh, this is a trash car, but that's not a bus.

52
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:28,649
Where's the bus? You are here. Where's the bus? Oh, okay. There it is. All right. I want to go to,

53
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,299
I want to go to one. I want to go to UFO point. Is this going to UFO point? This is going to

54
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:41,940
Barry's pond. No, we're at Barry's pond. How do I choose where I want to go? I don't want to give

55
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,500
my bus pass. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'll give it. I'll give it a

56
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:52,279
give it. Let me in. Okay. Where are we going? Beach front. Oh, okay. I get off. It's a bus.

57
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:01,289
I never, I never took the bus. You just get out when you want. Right. Okay. I never took,

58
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:08,519
I took the subway guys. You got, I lived in, I lived, I lived in Boston in my, in almost my

59
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:26,970
entire life. So I took the subway. It's not the same thing. I took the T like the, the T stops,

60
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:41,190
the MBTA buses don't exist in Boston. I don't even, I think they do, but not like you think

61
00:10:43,429 --> 00:11:05,669
the CBTA watch out, watch out. All right. Where I can't, I can't see that far. Can I stand up?

62
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,700
Press E. Should I get off now? No, we're not there yet. That's Larry's arcade. I want to go to the

63
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:30,600
UFO. The UFO is the arcade, the new one. I don't know what I have to also call my dad for more

64
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,889
money. All right. This is home. My home is the gas station. How does that make any sense?

65
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:53,399
There's a long bus. Like I could have just walked there. I have to go to the money grabbing machine.

66
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:02,139
Right. Well, let's see what I can play with 94 dollars. This is just actually a real bus.

67
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:14,809
Next stop. What's after home? Mountains. This is taking me all over the whole city.

68
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:32,139
You're going to get motion sick. Why am I going to get motion sick? I don't think this is even

69
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:48,580
in the game last time I played. All right. UFO peer is coming up next. Nobody's getting on or

70
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,500
off the bus. This is kind of depressing. The newspaper behind you says Jeremy. No, it says

71
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:05,620
Jerry's. All right. Coming out. Here we go. UFO peer. How does a bus work? Uh, it drives around

72
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,460
in a circle and lets people off at designated stops. You can then get on the bus or get off

73
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,059
at any of those designated stops. As long as you have a ticket to get on. This is half life too.

74
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:34,360
It kind of is. This is how long it takes in half life too to go. The only difference is

75
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,019
we're not getting the voiceovers. Fuck the Drew crew bro. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

76
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:54,120
You don't come to the Drew crew turf and talk like that. What? Jesus. That actually scared the shit

77
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:12,070
out of me. I was just here. We did a full circle. Where's the UFO? What is the point of taking the

78
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:23,700
bus if we just went around in a full circle? Can I get off? He just called half life two,

79
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,110
half life one. I did. No, you get on. This is like a train in half life two that you,

80
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:42,899
or is that half life one? That happens in both. That happens in both. Yeah. What are you talking

81
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:55,740
about? It happens in both you fake gamer. There it is. Oh, look it. It's so glorious. Look at how

82
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:07,419
glorious that is. It's awesome. All right. Let's go. Wow. I can't wait to go in there and spend

83
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:22,659
some tokens. UFO. What does this say? Raceway and fun center. All right. It's done. It's ready.

84
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:36,889
It's ready for us to enjoy. Let's go. Oh, wow. Wait, this go-karts in here too? This is go-karts.

85
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:48,860
Holy shit. It's awesome. What are the new games? Butterfly catcher? Oh, you got to do the thing

86
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,220
you do when you go into every new arcade. You don't spend any money. You just walk around and

87
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,860
go, oh, look at this one. All right. What about this next one? Mermaids from space. It's coin one.

88
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:14,139
Nice. Ski ball. Clock tower. Whack a mole. What's this one? Oh, down a bot. I know this one. This

89
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:27,289
one's good. Iceberg bounce. I think we've played this one. Maybe not. Just toss it. Ooh, ticket

90
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:39,340
redemption center. I want to see the prizes of the UFO one. What do you get for prizes? Alien

91
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:47,259
plush green. Aliens. A pet moon rock. That's pretty sick. We're going to get all the planets. I hope

92
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:59,399
Jupiter's on here. Lava lamp. Fun capacitor. Plasma ball. It's one of these things you put your hand

93
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:07,670
on. Light sword. Oh, there's lightsabers in this one. Oh, my God. How many? Hover board is 100,000

94
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:19,259
tickets. Okay, it's 100,000 tickets to the hover board. I want a lightsaber. I want I want the blue

95
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:27,059
lightsaber. I want the hover board. And I want the thing that you put your hand on. Get the hover

96
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:33,220
board. All right, I will. I also am going to turn the sound down again, because it's I'm going to

97
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:49,420
hurt somebody. All right, that sounds good. Let's go. Wait, what else is in here? This thing. This

98
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:58,230
thing sucks. You can't win this thing. It's the do-goo. This one's actually rigged. They've made

99
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,950
videos on this one. It's actually impossible to win unless the person that's operating it wants

100
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:12,940
you to win. Hold on. There's a claw gate. Isn't there upstairs too? Popcorn Pete. Hey, kids,

101
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,700
I win an official popcorn Pete plush toy. Collect all eight cards and win a Pete plush.

102
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,250
Ah, look at this. There's a popcorn machine too.

103
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:30,170
Fucking game of the year. You want to know what my game of the year is? This. Dude, where's my cow?

104
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:47,960
Oh, what is this one? Wormhole. Let's check out the back. DeVito Do? DeVi-Devo-Devotted Do.

105
00:18:48,759 --> 00:19:13,019
I'll take one. Give me it. Give me another one. Give me more. Give me more Danny DeVito Do.

106
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:32,180
It's so loud. I tried to turn it down. How loud is that? Is it so loud that you can't even stand it?

107
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:47,029
It probably is. I'm gonna give it a ceiling. That should help. You let me know. This is a

108
00:19:47,029 --> 00:20:08,119
test to see if it hurts. Tell me if it hurts. Pretty good. I'll take another one. Oh shit.

109
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:23,450
Let's do it again. I'm making a tower. How many can I put on one tower? Oh my god.

110
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:34,309
That's like six. Imagine seeing somebody do this. I feel like you draw a crowd at this point.

111
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:44,460
I think that's the end of the tower. Oh my god. It's not. It's almost as tall as me.

112
00:20:47,849 --> 00:21:02,230
I'm wasting money. Oh shit. I am wasting money. You're right. Oh, that's it. Hold on.

113
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:34,619
Whatever. We got six. Who cares? Oh, money machine. Let's go. Just like at the carnival.

114
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:48,579
This isn't a restroom. I'm not going to the bathroom in here. Quick. Get the bits. Get the

115
00:21:48,579 --> 00:22:34,180
hundred. Oh. Monka. Omega. All right. Let me out. I'm thrown out of here instantly. Throw it like

116
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:40,700
onto the track. All right. I'll get those later. Let me go upstairs. I want to see what's upstairs.

117
00:22:48,220 --> 00:23:01,799
What is up here? Laser zone? What is laser zone? Welcome to laser zone. It's five bucks.

118
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:10,150
It's laser tag. All right. What else is over here? Okay. You just can go down to the go-karts.

119
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,180
And that's what's that. All right. Let's go. Let's do laser tag first.

120
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:26,940
This is a pretty substantial update. How do? What is going on? I can't. I'm not.

121
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:40,809
You gotta go. Go for the base. Go for the base. Go for the base. Here's the actual pro tip when

122
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:46,170
you're playing anything. Any laser tag. Sneak around back to the base. Usually it's a dome.

123
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:52,329
That's all the way in their corner. And just hold down the trigger. Just at the base. You'll be

124
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:57,369
number one on the leaderboards every time. Don't even fight anybody. Do not fire at any other

125
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,130
people. Use all your ammo only for the small little light dome that's in their base.

126
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:10,039
It's funny because people will just ignore you. I just died. You'll get 100% ignored.

127
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:28,599
Where's my ammo? How do I get ammo? Ammo? Where's ammo? Oh, recharge station. Here we go.

128
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:37,859
All right. Let's do it. But yeah, a typical laser tag game is about,

129
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:41,940
I don't know, it'll be 15 minutes. You could spend a full 13 and a half minutes as long as

130
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,579
you sneak into the back of their base. You'll have like 60 million points. And when they print

131
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:53,619
out the scorecard showing how awesome everybody was, you'll be, you'd be like insanely, you'd be

132
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:59,269
so out of reach. Let me do it now. Well, these people, there's no, I don't think there is a base.

133
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:13,190
No roughhousing. I would have just got yelled at. A whistle would have just gotten like blown.

134
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:29,529
It is still so loud though. I have to like do it manually again. Where are they? Are they dead?

135
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:42,099
Got them both. Game over. Oh, I got a two. All right. That was, that's a 2.0 K.D. That's not bad.

136
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:53,539
I just got 400 tickets for doing that. Holy, that's a lot. I'm doing that again.

137
00:25:54,259 --> 00:26:03,539
This time I'm going to try as hard as I can. I understand the game now. Let's go. It's time to

138
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:09,220
be the very clear adult that shouldn't be in there that's killing everybody. You know what I mean?

139
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,759
That's like tagging everybody. There's some dad that's just going overboard and just like,

140
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:24,789
got you, got you, got you, got you. Oh, I got you through the wall. Yeah, you're dead. It's like,

141
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:30,980
Jesus, come on dad, fucking relax. No, no, you have to go back. Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.

142
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:48,569
Got you. Call your hits. Yeah, this is, this is annoying older kid or dad that's going too hard.

143
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:56,980
This is also the dad that when he comes out of this, he has a full band of sweat on his head.

144
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:05,740
Do a laser tag stream. That actually might be like kind of funny.

145
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,259
You'd have to find a place that would allow you to do that though.

146
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:34,140
Back to spawn. Literally spawn camping children. It's also the worst when you realize,

147
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:39,640
so when you play laser tag and you, it can be very disorienting. There's fog machines,

148
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,359
loud music, there's lights everywhere. Somebody on the other team could just be standing behind

149
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:51,720
you, walking behind you the whole time, going like this to your back. And you just have no idea.

150
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,680
It sucks because then you'll go look at your score, which a lot of these places,

151
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,039
they'd like, I said, they do a printout and it shows you like your, your accuracy and,

152
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,079
and it looks like times hit 680. And you look at the person next to you and you're like,

153
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,519
what did you give times hit? Oh, four. Oh, what the fuck?

154
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:25,539
How many tickets is that? Um, guys, this is where you farm. The tickets is right here.

155
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,859
We're getting that hoverboard. All right. Well, I'll, I'll come back.

156
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:56,220
18 KD. Nice job, dad. Let's do the, uh, go-karts. Nice. See, look, little Doug.

157
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:07,289
You know what always scared me about this? Anytime you went to a place that had go-karts,

158
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:15,289
the staff for some reason would just be walking around, like on the track and shit.

159
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:21,059
And I'd always be so scared to drive fast because somebody would just be walking by. It's like,

160
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,900
Oh shit. That person, that, that's it. They don't care. It's just a staff member.

161
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:38,069
I see him like 300 feet away. They're like moving. Yeah. They'd be like,

162
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:49,740
there's like a guy smoking a cigarette, like right there. This is how you drive.

163
00:29:50,619 --> 00:30:04,279
No, this is not an indicator of how I drive. And it always was so annoying because the somebody,

164
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,839
when you knew you were on your last lap, you'd see the worker come and close the gate and you're

165
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,519
like, no, don't close the gate. And you have to go the other way. There's a separate way you have

166
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:20,170
to go to put the carts back. Still in last place. I don't know if this was a competition five seconds

167
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:52,299
ago. Am I on one wheel? I wish I had a controller. Oh, that was a tight turn. And that was tight

168
00:30:52,299 --> 00:31:02,519
turn. He had a red shell. How have they not made a game that was, you know, those VR experiences,

169
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,119
how they're all stupid. Come check out the VR experience where you get like a little laser gun

170
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:14,940
and the polygons are five times bigger than they should be. Why not have a Mario Kart style

171
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:20,859
VR experience where there's like 12 seats, everyone's in a car and it moves around this

172
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:28,259
feedback and you're actually in like a Mario Kart style race. That exists. Oh, I want to play it.

173
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:35,960
Where do I play that? I have to come in first place eventually here. Not now though. I just

174
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:53,480
want to check it out that they literally do that in Japan. Are you serious? Japan seriously is

175
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,559
that one place on earth where they seem to just do everything better than everybody else for some

176
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,039
reason. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, we have arcades here in America. Yeah, yeah, we do.

177
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:15,640
Oh, they're really fun. Sometimes this you can play Mortal Kombat 3. Oh, no, you can't. Sorry,

178
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,680
both of the coin slots have been taped over because the machine's broken.

179
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,450
You want to play the new Halo game where you can shoot as Master Chief?

180
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:29,210
Go, good luck. There's always four people sitting in there and they're part of the same four friends

181
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,170
that came and they're not leaving that booth. They never get out until they like they beat the game.

182
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:41,400
I feel like this place is in Japan where I can put on a headset and eat food but not in real life,

183
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:52,200
but I still get full of nutrition and stuff. Also, very, very, very important. When are arcades

184
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,720
going to implement the old school Super Nintendo Mario comes up and says it's time for somebody

185
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,799
else to play? Remember that shit when you went to used to go to GameStop? We're like,

186
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:10,410
why don't they do that? Those of you that don't know, in every GameStop, in most video game stores

187
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,809
or boutique stores, whatever, there was always like a Super Nintendo or PlayStation 1 in the corner.

188
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:21,130
That was just a demo. You could just play it was various games. If you stayed on that for more than

189
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:26,490
15 to 20 straight minutes, Mario would come on. It would go to a black screen. Mario would appear

190
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:33,430
and go, thank you. Next person in line, please. That, yes, it did. That happened. And that person

191
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,619
would have to leave. Otherwise, it would look like a total asshole. Yes, that happened. Yes, it did.

192
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:51,380
It's real. Making that up. You're paying money though to play that one. Yeah, but I got money.

193
00:33:51,380 --> 00:34:00,490
I want to pay too. Will they have more than one machine then? All right, let's do this one. I'm

194
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:06,680
going for it. How much does this one cost? Two bucks. That's a lot. First fucking try. That's how

195
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:14,309
we do a first try jackpot. I'll take a first try jackpot. Thank you. Everybody show up. Everybody,

196
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:25,050
that's me you're talking to. That's me you're talking to. Let's do it again. These are my tickets.

197
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:41,349
Get the fuck out of here. Again. I'll never get it again. Spin again. Yeah, it's like laggy.

198
00:34:42,309 --> 00:35:03,059
Again. Again. What's the jackpot at now? Fuck, he's going to chase that high all night.

199
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:35,909
I'll take another jackpot. That's two. He's just lucky. I don't think he is. I don't think he is.

200
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:47,050
I think he's got the skill to be able to get a... How many tickets do I need? A lot. I'm going to

201
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:57,050
trip on these. Is money laundering going on in here? No, there's no money laundering. I don't do

202
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:02,739
that. Here's the problem with this machine though. You'll get so frustrated playing this machine.

203
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,500
Typically, this is how you do it. You put your money in. You wait. Okay, go around.

204
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,909
Go around. Gah, I missed. But you'll do this 10 times in a row and get so frustrated that you

205
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:18,150
try to catch it instantly right when you activate and put your money in like this.

206
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:43,320
Fuck. Let's go again. Okay. I am unstoppable. What? Did I get two in a row? I did it. I

207
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:53,300
didn't do it. I did it. Security? Why is this guy going to explode? What's going on? Why is

208
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,760
this person going to explode? Get this person. This person's a bomb. This person's going to explode.

209
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:31,579
What the fuck? Get out of here. Get the bomb out. Get him out. What about my tickets? Again,

210
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:56,539
it's a sparkler. Whatever. I'm going to get kicked out of the casino. I'm going to get

211
00:37:56,539 --> 00:38:10,699
kicked out of the casino. No, I can't do that right now. Did the game crash? Let's do it again.

212
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,099
Hey, Jeff. Thanks for the five community subs.

213
00:38:52,809 --> 00:39:10,969
I can't lose. I can't lose. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let me count. Let

214
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:22,969
me see my winnings. Get it out of here. No. Look at the jackpot keeps going up. I'm going to...

215
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,570
You think I'm not going to get that hoverboard? Are you serious? Let's go count the tickets.

216
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:40,809
Out of my way. That's 4,000 tickets already. You don't think I'm going to get 100,000?

217
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,260
Oh, what's this one? How much money do I have? 94. Cool. Let's start over here. Right here. This

218
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,739
sounds good. How do you play this one? How does this one go? Just toss it. You throw the ball.

219
00:39:49,739 --> 00:40:01,829
Cool. This sounds fun. I'm going to do it right now. That's fine. Let's go. Oh, I'm going to be

220
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:15,369
obsessed with this. I'm going to be... I just toss it forehead. You don't think I'm going to

221
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:22,099
do this one again? Absolutely. How many do I need? How many points do you actually need to win the

222
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:54,230
super jackpot? Oh, shit. Again, I did it. 270 tickets. Again, I'm going to try to get more

223
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:22,420
than once. It's only 200. Yeah. I mean, come on. What's this jackpot? Oh, I almost just soft locked

224
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,860
it. Yeah, that was close. Oops. Oh, God damn it. I actually, I didn't, I really didn't mean to do

225
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:43,429
that. I went too high. What? Like you've never done that before? Please. I got it again. I mean,

226
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:48,570
no. You've never accidentally tried to throw something in one of these things that just

227
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:56,760
bounces back and hits you in this chest. That does happen. That's never happened to you.

228
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:02,469
You've never been playing like the football game or the throw the thing, toss the thing,

229
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:07,579
and you go a little too hard and it bounces back and hits you in the chest. You know,

230
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:13,500
the throw the football through the holes. You've never hit the, you've never missed the one you're

231
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,340
trying to hit the little one at the very bottom and it bounces back and hits you in the face.

232
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:36,860
I got it again. You're taking the, I'm an idiot too far. I feel like we've been to different

233
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:47,590
arcades. I'm sorry. Those of you, everybody, everybody over the age of like 28 in the chat

234
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,130
right now. This is like probably eight of you. You remember playing the throw the ball. You had

235
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:59,590
to like throw it hard because the shit was broken half the time. Throw the ball into the hole and

236
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,869
it wouldn't go in. So you had to throw it kind of hard and it would bounce back and hit you in the

237
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:23,579
stomach hole in the sign. Oh shit. You're right. Hole in the sign, hole in the sign, hole in the sign.

238
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:28,469
I once bounced a basketball at the top of the cage in the hoop game and smashed myself in the

239
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:37,820
face and started crying. Thank you. Thank you for explaining how this happens. I don't think I can

240
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:56,139
make that. Oh guys, I don't think that's possible. Is it? It might be possible. Oh,

241
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:09,719
it's going to be possible. Shit. Stop wasting throws. It's all right. I got, I have $84.

242
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:14,179
Yeah. I'm the guy that walks into the arcade with a hundred dollars.

243
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:40,969
A little higher. This is going to kill me. More power. I'm holding it down as far as I can go.

244
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:52,070
I might, I might have to come back to this.

245
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:05,539
Give a shot. Put a bowling ball. No, because that's dangerous and stupid. I'm not going to hit this.

246
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:13,829
Aim. Like that's no, it doesn't do anything. You can't bounce it.

247
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:37,880
What happened? Where'd it go? Oh, all right. I'm never going to get it. I'm never going to get it.

248
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:47,320
Leave. Maybe I'll try it later. Another day. All right. What's next? I want to play it though. All

249
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:53,750
right. Is this one. I, this one's fun. This is when you throw a bunch of a ping.

250
00:45:56,309 --> 00:46:06,659
That's going to happen every time in it. Now there is strategy with this one. What you do is

251
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:13,530
you scoop up all of them. There's usually about maybe 20 or 30. You get as many as you can hold

252
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,250
in your arms and you just toss them all up at the exact same time over here. And you just, that's,

253
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:26,489
you'll hit most of them. Game. It's going to do that loud song again, isn't it?

254
00:46:31,210 --> 00:47:02,250
All right. Here we go. Come on, get them all. Ah, do it again. I get it. Cheating. How am I

255
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:23,769
cheating? Get the ones in the front first. Get it. That's it. I got them all. That one wasn't even

256
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:28,489
hard. Bonus round.

257
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:42,019
Shit. Okay. That's gonna, I gotta get it. You gotta do bonus first.

258
00:47:46,389 --> 00:48:11,800
First part's not hard. Get it. Get this last one. Get the last one, please. Get the last one.

259
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,210
Bonus round. Go with the front row first.

260
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:58,710
It's loud for me. So what's the strategy? Middle out? You think? Like middle out. Middle out?

261
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:15,500
Just throw fast. All right. I'm just going to spam them. Spam. Spam. Spam. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

262
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:21,590
That shit's impossible. This is not even possible. I don't think it's even possible.

263
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,070
It's gonna take insane long. It's not even possible.

264
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:37,420
What about off the edge? I mean, it doesn't really do much.

265
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:51,110
Okay, one more time. That's it. Final attempt. And then moving on to down the bot, whatever it's

266
00:49:51,110 --> 00:50:08,599
called. Bonus round. There you go. You can't do it. It's not possible. Whatever.

267
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,530
I'm getting a lot of time today. Okay. All right. Let's move on.

268
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,079
Nice. All right. Here we go. Here's one of the games I'm talking about, guys.

269
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:31,030
If you've ever played this before, you whip balls at these things.

270
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:54,219
Oh, I got to get this better. I can do this better. I can do that better. 500 or go home.

271
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,000
I think. Yeah. 500 points or go home.

272
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,059
They're already down. They can't go down anymore.

273
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,559
How's that worse than last time? It got, it fucked up.

274
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,860
Aim for the one that has red light. Yeah, that's what I was doing.

275
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:40,500
Oh, this is going to be worse.

276
00:51:54,579 --> 00:52:04,869
Now you got it. Okay. I got it. I got plenty of money. I'm bad. All right. Sure.

277
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:32,630
It's not, that wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad. 380 down as many as possible.

278
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:58,820
The light is bait. Is that true? Is it light bait? The light is bait. All right. Light is bait.

279
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:04,980
I'm going for just a full on hit. Every single, I have to, if you hit every single throw,

280
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,900
you'll get 500. That should work.

281
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:35,619
God damn it. Shoot between them. It's, it's just my sensitivity.

282
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:49,670
Oh, don't go for the top ones. Bad idea. Let's try to, it says that I need more sensitivity.

283
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,679
I'm going to get, ah, I'm going to get stuck here. I'm going to get stuck here. It's okay.

284
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:16,340
I'm going to do it. I need to get at least 400 or something.

285
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:42,409
Oh, all right. I keep getting stuck in the same spot. Go for doubles only. Let me see.

286
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:54,969
That's not reliable. Now doubles ain't reliable. Check that.

287
00:54:54,969 --> 00:55:12,300
Doubles ain't reliable. Now doubles ain't reliable. Unfortunately doubles just kind

288
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,539
of happen to try a second row. Maybe it just farm doubles in the second row. Maybe we'll see.

289
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:28,250
Okay. You can do, we're only going to do the, the, the bottom and the, okay. We're going farming

290
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:41,900
doubles. I'm just a psycho. Do you have to be? All right. Let's try it for real this time.

291
00:55:41,900 --> 00:56:11,860
And I'm moving on. We're going to skee ball next. What? That's, that's too hard to do that. I need

292
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:15,940
more sensitivity. All right. Last one. Finally, actually last one. I'm just going to go try as

293
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:43,800
many as I can. This is bait. It's fine. Here we go. I don't, I don't care. I don't care. I don't

294
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,949
care. It's, it's the sensitivity. It's got to be higher. I can't move. Just no, no, get me out.

295
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:56,860
Get me out. Get me out of here. No, if I increase sensitivity, I'll stay there for like another three

296
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:25,500
hours. Sure. Is there sensitivity? I don't know. There is no sensitivity. Well, let's go. This is

297
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:31,099
just original skee ball. I think this one's in the old game, but this one's a, it has a, yeah,

298
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:48,340
this one has a space theme to it. Skee ball is one of those games that you seriously get. I get

299
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:53,579
oh, Jeremy, that's never happened to me in an arcade before. No way. I, when I play skee ball,

300
00:57:53,579 --> 00:58:02,579
if I, if I, that never happens to me. Yes, it does. No, I've never rolled a little too hard

301
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:13,780
for it to hit the back and go forward. What are you, what are you, what are you for? No,

302
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:18,820
Jeremy, I've never walked over to the side and placed every single ball in the hundred. No,

303
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:43,000
Jeremy, I'm such a good boy. Not everyone's as bad as you, boomer. You guys are describing

304
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:52,860
a technique that I did maybe when I was 11. I wasn't a boomer when I was 11. 50 points.

305
00:58:52,860 --> 00:59:10,840
I can do better than that. I can do much better than that. 11 year old boomer. Everything's a

306
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:19,929
boomer. Guys, I'm drinking a coffee right now. It's pretty good. That's boomer coffee.

307
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:31,059
I drink my, this coffee's better. Oh, okay. Uh, guys, I drive, uh, I drive a Honda Civic.

308
00:59:31,059 --> 00:59:45,369
That's a boomer car. Oh, okay. Guys, I buy a Charmin ultra soft toilet paper. That's a boomer

309
00:59:45,369 --> 01:00:04,010
toilet paper. I use it per day. Okay. Hope you're having a good day. I am. Hey, thanks.

310
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:14,869
Hope you're having a good day too. I gotta get at least 100 before I leave.

311
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:27,719
What's my favorite ice cream? Mom's bacon cookie from Baskin Robbins. It's the best ice cream ever

312
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:34,300
and I think it no longer exists. I tweeted about it and they deleted it off their menu.

313
01:00:35,849 --> 01:00:40,860
That tweet, by the way, had like 600,000 impressions on it. Why would you get rid of

314
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,940
that ice cream after, after somebody that literally has hundreds of millions of people

315
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:57,159
viewing their Twitter? How could you do something like that? Impressions. Well, how many impressions

316
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:05,420
did that get? I don't know. Who gives a shit? You know what impressions means, guys? I'm going to

317
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:10,940
give you some, some fucking influencer lingo here. Those of you that don't know, that is actually

318
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:16,219
how many times people may have even just scrolled by and not given a shit about the thing that you

319
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:32,460
said. Yeah, but they, but they still, they still went by it. Okay. Fucking boomers. Am I right?

320
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:51,900
I have to get a hundred. Come on. I can't find mom's bacon cookies. I know it's actually

321
01:01:51,900 --> 01:02:00,039
unfortunate. It actually is. He's trying to be probably, probably was like seasonal

322
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:08,139
and I know I'm going to say this, but imagine having seasonal ice cream.

323
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:22,380
Is that, is that real? It's, it's not like pineapples are not in season. You know what I mean?

324
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:39,079
It's ice cream. Seasonal pizza. I have to get a hundred. Why can I not get a hundred?

325
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:51,320
Pumpkin spice lover is suffering. I don't, I don't know. Okay. I guess I do get it. It's like a

326
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,719
marketing thing where it's like pumpkin spice during the fall. Ooh, warm and spicy and it's warm

327
01:02:55,719 --> 01:03:02,969
in your belly. Ooh, okay. But that pumpkin spice comes out of a bag. It's a powder that comes out

328
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:08,170
of a bag. It's not like, Oh, good thing these pumpkins are in season. My fresh pumpkin brains.

329
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:31,800
That's what you know. Get in there. I'm going to go aim down and yeah. All right. That's the

330
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:43,619
that's just, I'm going to aim down right there. A little bit higher sorting algorithm noise.

331
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:54,139
Oh yeah. I know what you're talking about. The things they, yeah. Oh, you're killing me. Yep.

332
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:16,260
Oh, I have to listen to it now. Then it goes like, Oh, I have to hear it right now. Let's go.

333
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:58,500
This is going to be loud as fuck. Hold on. Sorting algorithms. Yes. Ah, louder. No, it's like,

334
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:04,380
it's too, this is the best part. It gives the best part. Everyone quiet. Here comes the best part.

335
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:17,050
No, no, not this one. It doesn't, it goes. I'll wake my favorite one. No, fuck that one. That one

336
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:27,429
sucks. Dumb. Where is it? Here it comes. I think this is the one. This is the one. No, no, no, not

337
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:40,219
this one. It's a, it's one that's in two different sections. It's the one coming up next. Show it on

338
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:55,079
stream. Okay. I just want to show you my favorite one. It's all others are not even close. Not even

339
01:05:55,079 --> 01:06:24,860
fucking close. Give me this. Where's my source? All right. Here it comes. Can you see it? No, you

340
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:50,780
can't. People are going, dude, I don't, not that one. Not this one. Boom. Next one, please. Not

341
01:06:50,780 --> 01:07:10,889
this one either. Fuck this one. This one. Ready? Here it comes. This one. Yeah. Here it comes. The

342
01:07:10,889 --> 01:07:28,230
best part. It's the best part. Oh, that was the best part. All right. No, no, fuck that. Let's go

343
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:52,969
back to this. It's really that sound. That's so fucking funny. I have to get it in a hundred

344
01:07:52,969 --> 01:08:15,940
before I do anything. I can't know. It's lower octave. Stop getting tens. I'm trying to get a

345
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:32,359
hundred. I'm never going to get a hundred. Jerma, I just joined and the first thing to hear is

346
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:42,310
sorting algorithms. Why? Um, hold on. My, my, my, I'm, I can't even, somebody just complained

347
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:48,899
about the sorting algorithm. I, that's, I can't, I can't hear that right now.

348
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:04,340
You've complained about it before, have I? Oh, that's my favorite sorting algorithm. Skeeball.

349
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:23,739
See, here is the peer, the packets of data. Give me a hundred. Oh my fucking God. What was wrong

350
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:59,479
with that? I can't. It's, I need a new machine. It's definitely the angle. It's the angle. No.

351
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:03,260
Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. You don't think you've ever

352
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:10,970
hit a hundred in real life. Yep. You got to go up. There's actually a strategy. If you,

353
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:16,500
here's the thing about the hundred. When you hit the hundred, you just, you get into the zone

354
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:21,510
and you get two, three or four hundreds in a row. And then for the rest of the night,

355
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:42,340
you'll never hit one more. In fact, it might not happen for years. I have to hit this. Like

356
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:49,420
this is not this difficult. More than that. I'm not, I'm just going to, but the thing is I can't

357
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:58,729
keep the same angle because the game forces you down. Nancy drew waiting. You had a chance to

358
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:27,989
vote for Nancy drew and you soiled it. Why can I not do this? Why can I not do this? Good. Done.

359
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:45,899
I did it. What happened to that? Jesus. You suck. It is not easy to get it in this game. It's not

360
01:11:45,899 --> 01:11:57,239
easy to do. I think this is so easy. It's not. That's it. That's not easy. Oh, okay. At least

361
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:08,340
I heard the noise. Let's go. I cash in the tickets. See if I can get a lightsaber.

362
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:22,520
What do I have? 4,397. Let's go. I tried here. All right. We're almost 10% of the way to the

363
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:28,729
hoverboard. I'm just going to farm that. You know, I'm going to farm that. All right. What else we

364
01:12:28,729 --> 01:12:37,460
got? We're doing full circle and then we go in middle. That one looks cool. This was already,

365
01:12:37,460 --> 01:13:00,329
this was a 500. What? I'll take it. Mermaids from space. Mermaids and face coin pushers.

366
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:06,630
Five tickets, 10 tickets. You collect these. Anything else I need to know? All right. Let's

367
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:25,319
go. Multi credit. How many credits to load? 10. How many? I have 120 coins. This one is,

368
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:34,420
I love this already. Oh, I wish, this is why I wish this existed. This one, exact one.

369
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:54,729
All right. I got bonus. What did I do? Coin pusher. Pog. Yeah. Now this is content.

370
01:13:55,829 --> 01:14:12,500
This is the content that you came to this stream for. There it is. Where's the 100? There's 100

371
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:23,859
right here. I'll get it. Here it comes. Usually it's quarters and takes forever. Yeah. Oh,

372
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:36,920
it's still going. Still going. Yeah, that was good. That was a really good one. Right side now.

373
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:45,979
Look at all this delicious stuff on the right side. Watch this. We're going to get an avalanche

374
01:14:45,979 --> 01:15:01,880
right now. That's a burger boy tactic. Yeah, it is. Burger boy tactics work, guys. People want

375
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:09,770
patience. No, no, no, no. Just, you have to use the burger boy technique. Once that 100 goes down,

376
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:29,420
we're going to the left side. Just kill it. Kill the whole thing. Is this burger boy technique

377
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:49,720
or is this bored rich kid? I don't know. Last push. Oh, 1,290 tickets. 1,300 tickets. 1,400 tickets.

378
01:15:51,220 --> 01:16:08,600
Wow. You just got yourself 1,400 more tickets there. And credits. Get in the center. Oh,

379
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:16,390
shit. You're right. Look at all that in the center. 1,400 tickets. Cool. I like that they're green so

380
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:37,800
I can pretend that it's money. Again, last one. Last one. We're going right in the middle. Yeah,

381
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:45,189
the bored rich kid. There are people meticulously crafting their next shot with the quarter that

382
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:50,630
they have. Well, this dickhead over here is just spamming them. That doesn't even matter to him,

383
01:16:50,630 --> 01:17:05,000
apparently. This is going to be a lot. Look at this huge wave coming in. Spamming is not smart

384
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:16,630
because all the coins land on each other. Yeah, I know. In fact, I'm doing it wrong. You've got

385
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:22,310
to wait till it comes in here. I've played these before. The best technique is seriously this one

386
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:27,029
right here. You wait until it's all the way out. Put one down to make it so it's flat. Guaranteed

387
01:17:27,029 --> 01:17:43,420
flat. Sometimes you can get two. No more than that, though. Maybe three. Come on. That was a good one.

388
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:50,069
Get this left side. Don't neglect the right side either.

389
01:17:50,710 --> 01:18:12,890
Burger Boy wouldn't have wanted this. He's not dead. This is not what Burger Boy would

390
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:26,260
have wanted if he were alive. This one is actually mindlessly fun. All right, let's go mindless.

391
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:43,720
Look at that wave coming in. This is what Burger Boy would have wanted. There it is.

392
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:58,760
I got some extra credits. Hold on. Make these ones count. All right. Yes. Good.

393
01:19:00,789 --> 01:19:16,489
I got extra credits. Left side right here. I got one more shot right in the middle. Knock it down.

394
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:36,680
Look at that. It's so close. I get to keep going. This side right here. All right, that's probably it.

395
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:44,390
No, I get to keep going. Don't have to spend any more money. I beat my last record. 1,400.

396
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:58,939
Oh, shit. Any more? That's it. 16, 57. No, no, no. They're still pushing.

397
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:09,739
Mom, the creepy old man won't get off the coin game. Well, son, here's the thing about the creepy

398
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:17,770
old man. The creepy old man comes in here every day with $100 and allows the arcade to continue

399
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:23,609
to stay in business and lets them turn a potential profit for them to put another clock tower in the

400
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:35,939
game, in here, in the children casino. All right, here we go. Wait, I want to cash these in.

401
01:20:36,579 --> 01:20:54,859
What am I at? 12, 14,876. I'm almost at the lightsaber. Lightsaber's 30.

402
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:02,939
Now, don't even look at these middle games yet. This one's still at 500.

403
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:26,489
Almost. You gonna run out of money? It's all right. I'll get some more.

404
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:40,409
It's 500 every time. This is the best way to farm tickets.

405
01:21:47,300 --> 01:22:02,340
Building is on fire. Oh, I'm out of money. All right, I'm out of money. All right, back to the...

406
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:11,300
I need more money. Back to the money. Get that sparkler away from me. Yeah, I told you. You guys

407
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:20,550
thought I was going... acting crazy. Go play the check-in game? Not yet. Not yet. I still have to

408
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:29,300
experience all the new content. I don't have any money. Where's the money machine? Upstairs? All right.

409
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:52,970
I don't think I ever got the jackpot in the check-in game. I did not. I did? No. Yeah, no, I did. I did.

410
01:22:52,970 --> 01:23:05,739
That's right. I did. Top right corner. No, right in front of the door. I did it twice? Yeah, it was

411
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:23,109
like five months ago. I don't remember. Top right. I got 75 bucks. Let me out. Where were we? Oh,

412
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:33,130
that's right. Butterfly drop. How does this one work? Collect... collect all six to win the bonus.

413
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:46,869
What's the bonus? Oh, you have to put... it's like the hockey one. I remember the hockey one.

414
01:23:47,430 --> 01:24:00,409
This one's actually kind of hard. Get all the infinity stones. Oh, all right. This one...

415
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:07,180
those are about 50 tickets. This one could be pretty... this one could be pretty lucrative.

416
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:19,369
This one's bad. I mean, it's not the greatest game, but it doesn't mean it can't be lucrative.

417
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:42,220
Oh, shit. I missed. Oh, shit. This one sucks. Oh, this one sucks, but I have to get the bonus.

418
01:24:43,260 --> 01:25:05,850
Get away from me. You're using the net upside down. I didn't even realize that till right now.

419
01:25:10,119 --> 01:25:13,880
Depending... seriously, depending how lucrative the bonus is. I mean, we need to see it once.

420
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:50,020
How much is this? Two bucks? Holy shit. Is this even possible? This one sucked. Just, I know it

421
01:25:50,100 --> 01:26:05,340
sucks, but we... we have to see what the bonus does. I'm already two in. Shake the table. No,

422
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,859
you can't shake anything unless you get thrown out. There it is. Okay, there's orange and pink.

423
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:15,380
Got them both. All right, now we need red, blue, and yellow. That's it. All right, we can wait for

424
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:23,880
this rotation because there's a... this is red. I might... I can get the blue. Got it. All right,

425
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:46,649
now red and yellow. That's it. Here it comes. I broke it up a little. I'm sorry. If this bonus

426
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:52,090
is less than 500, I'm never gonna play this one again. Don't worry. You don't have to worry

427
01:26:52,090 --> 01:27:03,800
about that. Bingo. Yeah, I just need blue. Is it... where do you see 200? I don't see 200 anywhere.

428
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:21,420
I need red. All right, you guys didn't think there's gonna be 2,000 tickets for the bonus

429
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:28,939
here. That's a lot. That is a huge amount. That's a ridiculous amount, actually. So, I mean,

430
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:43,029
it's a lot. I feel like I could probably win the spaceship light machine thing four times before

431
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:54,090
I do this one. All right, let's move on. That is a good... that's a good grab, though. That's 2,000.

432
01:27:54,090 --> 01:28:03,479
More than 2,000 tickets. All right, other side. We have... ooh, wormhole. This one looks cool.

433
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:09,260
Two dollars before credit. What, do you drop it through? Let's get a good look.

434
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:19,270
So you just... oh, it goes all the way around. We gotta count seconds here. Okay, let's see.

435
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:27,100
From this... from when I click the button. One, two, three. All right, it's about three and a

436
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:33,699
half seconds. So how long does it take to go around? Let's see. Jackpot, for instance. Ready?

437
01:28:35,779 --> 01:28:46,760
One, two, three. All right, so ready? Check this out. I'll get it right here. Oh, I'm in the wrong

438
01:28:46,760 --> 01:29:03,510
place. One, two. All right, it's right there. Do it again. You start counting at one. Why do you

439
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:11,609
start counting at one, not zero? No, because I'm not a weirdo. Zero, one. No, it's one, two, three.

440
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:24,949
Not zero, one, two. See? That's the terrible ones. Zero, one, two. No, it's one, two, three.

441
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:35,529
He's not a programmer. Who counts like that? Nobody counts one... nobody counts zero, one, two.

442
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:46,020
I'll try it. I'll try it. All right, I'll try it. I'll try it. That's the correct way. Zero is

443
01:29:46,020 --> 01:30:08,489
a void. It's not even a real number. Zero. No. Zero, one, two. It's close. Zero, one, two.

444
01:30:08,489 --> 01:30:22,810
Two. That's literally untrue. Zero, one, one, zero. Zero, one, two.

445
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:38,899
So it works sometimes. Zero, one, two. All right, maybe I'll change the way I count numbers now.

446
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:54,470
Give me my tickets. That kid's gonna... look at how many burn marks are all over this kid.

447
01:30:56,739 --> 01:31:05,380
What? He's got like... you're messed up. We're gonna find where your parents are.

448
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:11,880
Leave him alone. Well, what do you want me to do? He's holding it so close to his face,

449
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:26,539
he's burning his face. Here we go. This is the one I'm talking about. Cow machine. First try,

450
01:31:26,539 --> 01:31:34,550
get it. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean this whole machine out. That's why you don't play this game

451
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:46,250
ever. That's why I don't... this thing grips as hard as your grandmother. Your grandmother

452
01:31:46,250 --> 01:32:05,779
has a real soft grip. You got to distribute the weight. I get it. Don't grab the head. No,

453
01:32:05,779 --> 01:32:10,939
no, no. You don't grab the head. You got to grab right in the chest. Right along the chest or

454
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:19,689
distribute the weight. That's not the chest, but I... no. I gotta get chest. There it is. It's lined

455
01:32:19,689 --> 01:32:29,130
up perfectly. Just got to get it right in the... right there where the weight is distributed.

456
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:36,539
If this ain't it, this is impossible. Look at that distributed weight.

457
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:43,340
Come on. It's... what? No, no, no. I want to play it. I want...

458
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:55,239
How am I supposed to do this? It's right in the chest. Right in the sternum. There it is.

459
01:32:56,779 --> 01:33:03,770
Get it over there. It's... you can't... it won't... it can't move. So how is it even possible?

460
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:32,420
I didn't get anything. It's rigged. No, it's a motion problem. Get it. All right,

461
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:45,300
that's a pretty good grip. It's impossible. You need to just toss it over here accidentally somehow.

462
01:33:46,020 --> 01:34:01,720
That might be it. All right. Accident. Nice. Pretty good accident. I got one. Cool. Let's

463
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:25,210
get another one. Let's get one so we can give it to somebody here. Throw it on the racetrack.

464
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:40,550
Why would I waste a perfectly good cow throwing it on a racetrack? Why would I waste it? That's

465
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:49,109
the one. That's a perfect grab. What? That doesn't even make any sense. The cow just struggled and

466
01:34:49,109 --> 01:35:00,890
got out. You have to actually throw it in like it did last time. Quick, get the Pikachu socks.

467
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:07,819
They're right there. I already got one, so it doesn't matter, but I'm gonna try.

468
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:30,300
Stop moving around so much. Settle. Settle. Settle. Why is it not settling? Throw it in there. Toss it.

469
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,500
Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw. Throw it in. Throw it in. Throw it in.

470
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:55,590
That's two. Oh, that was almost a free one. That was almost for free. Do it again. He's addicted.

471
01:35:55,590 --> 01:36:06,140
Addicted to mega milk. Oh, I see. You're doing it. All right. I see what you mean. He's

472
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:16,220
addicted. He's addicted. I want to try to get one for free. We need a good bounce on the free one.

473
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:26,140
This is a cute game though. Go for the closest one. Well, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying

474
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:35,449
to make a pile. Derma's going to be here for four hours. No, no, no, no, no. More like four minutes.

475
01:36:36,329 --> 01:36:55,859
Get it in. It's almost there. Grab it from the butt and then I should be able to toss it in there.

476
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:02,550
No, didn't get it. I just have to grab it. No, I have to push it in the head. I'm going to push

477
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:18,149
its head down. You know what I'm saying? Maybe it'll bump it in. Get it in there. Yes. Another one.

478
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:32,710
I want more. I wonder how much these sell for. Oh my god. I did it again. Another one. I want more.

479
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:55,930
I got to move some of these over this way. Let's try this guy right here. Right in the head. Got it.

480
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:24,779
I'm being such an asshole. Get your presents, man. I want to fill it to the brim

481
01:38:25,819 --> 01:38:37,590
and then sell them. I want to turn. Wait. You just have to wait because I'm currently

482
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:45,239
getting all of them. These probably sell for like a hundred bucks each at least.

483
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:57,109
I'm on a roll. Yeah. What happens if I get them all? Can I get them all? Will they just stack up

484
01:38:57,109 --> 01:39:11,369
over here and I can open the floodgates and have just a bunch of cows fly out? Some of them are

485
01:39:11,369 --> 01:39:17,260
impossible to get though because of where they're located. Is this why Derma decided to move to

486
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:39,859
Las Vegas? For claw machines? So you're holding up the line here. That's all right. Get the first

487
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:47,300
one you tried. This one is ready to go. Just need to get it right in the chest. Right here.

488
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:55,909
There it is. Go around. There we go. Get the blue one in the back. Blue? That's not in here.

489
01:39:58,649 --> 01:40:06,140
That's the background. Mario says it's time for someone else to play.

490
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:11,479
And then you just skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip as fast as you can so you hope nobody saw it.

491
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:24,779
They did. They all did. Is there something else buried in here?

492
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:40,659
What? The mod's doing a good job stopping copy and pasting trolls.

493
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:56,760
Yeah, good. So see you later. See you next time. Is it just, is it so much to ask to want to fill

494
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:18,260
this up and just turn around and just flex? Throw it in. I tell you, it's almost, okay, okay, okay,

495
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:22,899
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Ready? Watch.

496
01:41:23,859 --> 01:41:33,100
There it is. Oh, I'm so excited. I'm almost as excited for sorting algorithms.

497
01:41:53,529 --> 01:41:56,250
All right. I'm gonna get one more in there. One more and then I'm gonna open it up and

498
01:41:56,250 --> 01:42:03,079
then I'm gonna turn around and be like, have at it, kids. And they're all gonna be like, yeah.

499
01:42:03,079 --> 01:42:20,300
You're gonna make a, you're just making a riot? No. What? Does it count as a win if I pick the

500
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:32,699
one up that's right there and drop it over the sensor? I'm sure it does. I just have to get one

501
01:42:32,699 --> 01:42:38,140
more in here and that's it. Look, I went over the double dare line. Okay. I put enough milk in there

502
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:50,649
to win the family challenge. Hold on. But I want to do more. I just want one more and then I'm done.

503
01:42:50,649 --> 01:42:54,810
I won't have to play it again. Just want one more. I want to go so far over it that it's just like a

504
01:42:54,810 --> 01:43:01,770
joke. Like, holy shit, man. What overkill is this? You did it. You won. But I want to make sure that

505
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:09,130
no one else gets to win as much as I did. I want to be on the leaderboard over there. All right.

506
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:26,619
Good. It's in a good spot. Cow leaderboard. Come on. I did it.

507
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:35,880
It's as many as it could possibly go in there. Let's go in. Let's see what we can get. I wonder

508
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:55,539
if I win. Did I win? Oh, wow. I won. See the real evil mastermind here thing to do.

509
01:43:57,079 --> 01:44:00,039
Beat it. Whip out some super glue in like super glue. The door shut.

510
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:08,899
So it's like, there's prizes right there. We can't get them. The prizes are right there.

511
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:34,180
You evil, evil man. Jeremy, you need to let go. Oh yeah. I said I was going to stop after that.

512
01:44:34,739 --> 01:44:40,220
It's all right. Yeah. That's a cartoon villain scheme. All right. I'm out.

513
01:44:41,180 --> 01:45:05,779
Let's get our prizes here. Oh, no. The prizes are right there. I can't get them.

514
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:23,750
Oh, what are you doing? What the hell is it doing? Can I go in and reach my hand in there?

515
01:45:25,239 --> 01:45:29,670
Wait, hold on. I have to just jostle. I have to just move. Yep. There it is. Okay.

516
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:36,390
No, no, no. Don't pick it up. I want to get out. I want to get out. I don't want to pick that up.

517
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:54,069
All right. I can try this one. This one's like right here. All right. That's it. That's it.

518
01:45:54,069 --> 01:46:07,420
It's not softlocked. I can pull these ones out. Look, there are a couple. There are a couple that

519
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:24,060
are softlocked, but I can get them. See, I just have to pay money. No, I don't. Jeremy,

520
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:27,739
what are you doing? I'm just trying. I don't want to waste the money. I might as well try to grab one.

521
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:41,529
All right. That's good. They're both ready. All right. I beat the cow machine. Cool.

522
01:46:42,649 --> 01:46:45,689
Uh, what do we have? Oh, there's more in the middle. All right. Hold on.

523
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:52,920
Why don't we have tickets? Get all of them. You don't really think I'm going to sit there

524
01:46:52,920 --> 01:47:03,109
and get every single cow in that machine. Why on earth would I do that? Let's check my inventory.

525
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:12,069
Good. One, two, three. All right. Cool. I didn't despawn. I have them. Oh, I want to get a Mr.

526
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:15,109
Potato Head. How do I do this? All right. Right. It's from the middle. I can get one of these. I

527
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:32,390
just have to win. I have 20,000 tickets. I need 80,000 more. Do this one first. Okay.

528
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:49,189
You can only count to three. I don't have coins. What are you talking about? Oh.

529
01:47:49,750 --> 01:48:03,300
Hey, I have something for you. This is for you. Come here. This is less dangerous.

530
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:14,760
Get over here. I have something. This is for you. This is for you. It's less dangerous. Here.

531
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:26,939
Oh, he fell downstairs and he hit his mouth. Oh, I'm sorry about that, kid. I'm sorry. He's running.

532
01:48:31,739 --> 01:48:44,250
Even though when a kid, when like somebody cries, it's like, it gets louder. Yes.

533
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:54,550
You're mocking him. I remember when I used to cry. I would do this thing. And a lot of people do

534
01:48:54,550 --> 01:49:02,520
this when something happens. That's so traumatic. Something like, Oh, I bumped my hand and it hurt.

535
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:07,880
You start instantly crying insanely hard, but you said no noise is coming up.

536
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:27,399
So you have this face like this. Should I turn the camera on for this? So you have this face,

537
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:39,289
right? That looks like this. Like princess bumped my hand real hard. Ready? Like, and then crying

538
01:49:39,289 --> 01:49:57,770
happens. Sometimes it's, it's really delayed. Here comes an edit. Who cares? Nice hair hippie.

539
01:49:57,770 --> 01:50:05,579
Ban that person for life, please. And you can always tell like, Oh, oh no, you like bumped your

540
01:50:05,579 --> 01:50:17,539
knee. Oh shit. Oh, here I, oh, oh, here. I see that face and like it's, oh, it's, you know, it's

541
01:50:17,539 --> 01:50:51,270
coming. You have good here. Hey, thanks. Three in a row, three in a row, three in a row and I get,

542
01:50:51,270 --> 01:51:10,300
and I get a thousand subs. Oh, too bad. All right. Three in a row, three in a row, I get a thousand

543
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:20,859
subs. If I don't get three in a row, then I, I don't say that part. I don't want to say the next

544
01:51:20,859 --> 01:51:55,640
part. I don't want to say the next part. That's too unreliable. Ghost pepper? No. Got it. Three in a

545
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:12,859
row and I get a thousand subs. Not three in a row. I eat a ghost pepper. Oh, all right. Double

546
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:18,460
or nothing. If I get another, I get four in a row, I get 2,000 subs. Okay. Five and five or

547
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:31,859
nothing. If I, I'll eat 10 ghost peppers on stream or 10,000 subs. Oh shit. Oh, gambling.

548
01:52:31,859 --> 01:52:55,619
God damn it. I should have just, I should have just stopped there. That was a lot of subs. He's

549
01:52:55,619 --> 01:53:03,989
going to chase this high. Oh, there they are. They're the subs. 10. Nice. I just got 10. 10,000

550
01:53:03,989 --> 01:53:14,279
subs right there by cold war hall. Oh my God. 10,000 subs. You actually did it. I lost too.

551
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:26,260
That's a lot. 10,000 subs. Gifted. Holy shit. That's, how much money would that be? That's 50.

552
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:33,350
That's insane. Imagine that. Don't imagine that because that's never going to happen. So don't

553
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:38,710
worry. Dude. Oh dude. Coke. Coke. No, don't, I can't say that. If I say that, that's like,

554
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:44,810
I don't want to like slander a company. Oh, another 10,000 subs from you guys. That's

555
01:53:44,810 --> 01:54:04,010
20,000 subs. 10,000 from Antfork. Thank you. Holy shit. Zero. One. Two.

556
01:54:07,779 --> 01:54:22,859
Still good enough. You can do a little slander. Oh, Jerma sucks. Thanks to the 5,000 community subs.

557
01:54:23,659 --> 01:54:35,560
You guys are really doing, you guys are going hard. Three in a row. I get 50,000 gifted subs.

558
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:48,710
If I don't get three in a row, I will, I will try, I will try my hardest to eat a one small,

559
01:54:48,710 --> 01:55:01,500
a four by four piece of plywood. I get, I did it. I don't even know what that one was for.

560
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:06,380
I don't know what that one was for. That one's for something too. That one's for, that's another

561
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:38,520
50 million subs. I got a, I got a lot of tickets. Ghost pepper plywood. Jamie, thanks for the 5,000

562
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:48,970
community subs. Appreciate that. All right. I have 25,000 tickets. I'm, I just have enough

563
01:55:48,970 --> 01:56:06,710
for the lightsaber. Let's do this one. Trick with these, you got to stay in the middle.

564
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,310
Stay right in the middle and you have access to all of them. Say, I know some of you,

565
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:20,039
some of you gamers that play this, you'll go like this. Oh, I missed. Oh shit. Stay in the middle.

566
01:56:20,039 --> 01:57:22,539
Check this. All right. What's the, what's the score? I didn't see he was green. What? What?

567
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:41,989
Here we go. Oh, he lost his touch. Oh shit. I lost my touch. All right. Here we go. Here we go.

568
01:57:41,989 --> 01:57:47,130
This is the one. This is the one coming up. All right. If I get, I get three in a row, then I,

569
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:52,970
I sub to a ghost pepper. And if I get, if I don't get three in a row, I eat 10,000 community subs.

570
01:57:53,850 --> 01:58:12,279
I meant, I, whatever. I'm going to eat these subs now. That's the best tickets,

571
01:58:12,279 --> 01:58:20,979
pound for pound. We got one more game to play. Tiny. Thanks for the 8,000 subs. Appreciate it.

572
01:58:21,699 --> 01:58:27,260
Loose Cane. Thanks for 5,000 subs. Thank you guys. Seriously. Wow. A lot of fucking money.

573
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:41,510
My God. 5,000 subs. What? What the fuck? What are you doing? What are you thinking? What? What?

574
01:58:42,470 --> 01:58:53,850
Hold on. How many subs was that? 50,000 community subs? Oh, oh, what? No way.

575
01:58:54,649 --> 01:59:06,300
Who game? Whoa. 50,000. That's like 10 times. That's 10, 10 incomes. What the heck? All right.

576
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:22,810
Somebody actually just did it. What? Somebody just gave 50 subs. All right. That's enough. You did,

577
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:29,109
you just covered, you just covered everybody. Thank you. Raggle flaggle for the actually 50

578
01:59:29,109 --> 01:59:34,170
community subs. Appreciate that. That's actually 50,000 community subs. Thank you for that. That's

579
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:45,260
a lot of subs. A lot of them. A lot of people dodged. Come on. What an asshole streamer. What?

580
01:59:46,869 --> 01:59:57,510
That is actually a lot of money. Seriously. Thank you. Why am I an asshole? Because I was

581
01:59:57,510 --> 02:00:09,689
doing the what? No, that happened before that. I, I, I cut that joke off right now. And I was

582
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:15,850
thanking the person for real for 50 and the five. I was, I was doing tuber. You guys know the drill.

583
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:25,500
He's doing a fake reaction, but it didn't even happen. Grimmy sensation. Thanks to the five

584
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:30,859
subs. What's seriously, uh, waggle waggle. What's your name? I want to get it right. You just gave

585
02:00:30,859 --> 02:00:44,310
us a ton of money. Raggle flaggle. 50 community subs. Thank you. We need to get all the SpongeBob

586
02:00:44,310 --> 02:01:08,579
cards. I know this one. Oh, this is, I love this too. Can I get two? Uh, I gotta get in the flow.

587
02:01:08,579 --> 02:01:11,460
I have to get in the flow, get in the flow. I'm going to do like a hundred dollars in this.

588
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:25,340
Peculiar. Pangolin. Thanks for the five community subs. More subs. What? I got two. What? What

589
02:01:25,340 --> 02:01:29,899
happened? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Back up. I got him. I got Mr. Potato. It's over

590
02:01:29,899 --> 02:01:45,770
there. When did I get that? I didn't get, did I get all eight cards? I didn't see it. Did I get

591
02:01:45,770 --> 02:02:01,800
another Pete? Holy shit. I don't even know what this is. Wait, what are you, what are you linking?

592
02:02:02,439 --> 02:02:12,600
Link, link, link, link, link, link. Where are my teeth? Why did you take my teeth out of that?

593
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:26,949
I don't understand. All right. I got, I like, this one's fun.

594
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:44,739
Show the picture. I don't, I'm playing a game. Look at that eye. Those eyes are real, right? Link,

595
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:52,090
link, link. I know. I see it. You guys can't fool me anymore because now I just assume everything

596
02:02:52,090 --> 02:03:15,779
is fake. Here, I'll put it on screen. Here. You want to see? Here you go. Here's what everybody

597
02:03:15,779 --> 02:03:35,859
is laughing about in here. There it is. All right. Those two images have the same energy though.

598
02:03:49,050 --> 02:03:55,590
Now what? No, I'm not putting that one on stream. I hate that picture. That picture scares the shit

599
02:03:55,590 --> 02:04:02,380
out of me. I hate that one. I'll keep this one here, but that one is, I hate that picture more

600
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:21,829
than anything. That face you make when you get 50,000 subs. No, this is the face you make when

601
02:04:21,829 --> 02:04:29,270
the shower is too cold when you get in. What? It was running for like two minutes. What the fuck?

602
02:04:29,989 --> 02:04:44,699
There you go. No, I'm not putting, I'm not putting that image on screen. I'm sorry. I'm

603
02:04:44,699 --> 02:04:51,079
going to give everybody nightmares because it's scaring me. I hate that picture. That is, I hate

604
02:04:51,079 --> 02:04:58,840
it. I hate everything about that picture. It's the worst picture in the world. No, I refuse to put that

605
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:18,739
on stream. Nobody deserves to have to see that. How many tickets do I have? Free, free play.

606
02:05:21,989 --> 02:05:23,590
I want to get the card on the right.

607
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:35,779
Get in there. Here they come. No, worst possible opportunity.

608
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:50,279
Come on, big push. Oh yeah. What was it? Why was I faking that reaction?

609
02:05:58,649 --> 02:06:20,279
No, I'm not clicking any more of these. I'm trying to win a hoverboard. Get that card in there.

610
02:06:22,300 --> 02:06:36,500
Show the fucking picture. Jesus. Jesus Christ. Why do I click this? There's so many in here.

611
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:41,619
Do you see how many photos are in here right now? No, I'm not going to link the Dunkin Donuts

612
02:06:41,619 --> 02:06:56,199
gift card. We've seen that. It's funny. Okay. I'm serious right now. You, this is one of those

613
02:06:56,199 --> 02:07:01,399
images that you're never going to unsee. You're going to look at this and it's going to,

614
02:07:02,359 --> 02:07:09,380
you're not going to like this because I don't like it. And it kind of hurts my head. So just warning,

615
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:12,819
look away from the screen right now. If you actually don't want to never have this image

616
02:07:12,819 --> 02:07:37,300
get out of your head for the rest of your life. All right. I did it. Oh, it's on my other monitor.

617
02:07:37,300 --> 02:08:05,350
Get it off. You look like a bug. I got a bonus. I just want this card on the right and I can be

618
02:08:05,350 --> 02:08:16,010
done and I can go scratch lottery tickets. What do you mean wrong one? No, that's just an edited

619
02:08:16,010 --> 02:08:22,539
version. That was not, that one's not even as bad. That's like a typical scary image of like a scary

620
02:08:22,539 --> 02:08:36,890
monster. That's not, show it then. Nah, I'm superstitious. I don't, I don't show pictures

621
02:08:36,890 --> 02:09:05,420
of demons. Get in there. I haven't hit one. How am I this bad? Come on, give me that purple card.

622
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:22,579
That's all I want. Get it. Oh, yeah. Oh, spooky. That's spooky. Where's the 2000?

623
02:09:22,579 --> 02:09:34,470
Did somebody steal my 2000 tickets? What is this bullshit? All right. I was at the hoverboard

624
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:44,090
30% of the way to the hoverboard. Let's go. You ready? You know what machine I'm going to use.

625
02:09:51,260 --> 02:10:02,840
30%. Wait, does anybody know if I have to get them all here? Or can I get them from another,

626
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:09,130
I almost said restaurant. You don't? Okay. Well, I'm going to do this. I'm going to get like

627
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:28,020
10,000 more from this. Do this 10 times. What? I don't have any money. God damn it. All right.

628
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:31,060
We're going to go to the other arcade. I'm going to refresh my memory on the other games.

629
02:10:31,619 --> 02:10:45,699
It's time for lottery tickets? No, not yet. Not till I have my hoverboard. Do I have to take the

630
02:10:45,699 --> 02:10:54,460
bus again? Go play the bass game? Yeah, I could do that too. Wait, I want to mount and do. Oh,

631
02:10:54,460 --> 02:11:03,819
sorry. Not add whatever it is a Danny DeVito or something. Oh, that's not either. Whatever.

632
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:34,920
What was last time you guys drank a Mountain Dew? They gross for some reason to be Mountain Dew.

633
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:41,369
Just regular Mountain Dew tastes like there's too much syrup in it. It's almost like you

634
02:11:41,369 --> 02:11:47,609
melted a bunch of lemon lime popsicles and put it over ice and added a little bit of water. It's

635
02:11:48,090 --> 02:12:00,180
something about it. Did they change the recipe? Why don't I drink diet? Because drinking diet

636
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:15,500
anything is not really that great for you. The shit that they put in diet soda is really not good

637
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:22,500
for you. They put like aspartame in that shit. You don't want to be drinking that. We've come

638
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:30,819
up with a chemical that tastes sort of like sugar in a way. It also can cause a bunch of diseases.

639
02:12:30,819 --> 02:12:54,140
This is not in my car. That's fake news. Fake news at aspartame? A recent published review

640
02:12:54,140 --> 02:12:58,460
of all available evidence including hundreds of studies concluded the studies provide no evidence

641
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:16,010
to support an association between aspartame and can't whatever. No, that's the fake news. Is it?

642
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:26,840
Did I just get fake newsed? Fake newsed? Did I just get fake news brackets fake newsed? Did I? No.

643
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:40,649
Did that happen to me? I can't trust anything. What happened? Aspartame is one of the most

644
02:13:40,649 --> 02:13:44,010
controversial sweeteners in the world. It is claimed to cause health problems ranging from

645
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:48,010
headaches to cancer. On the other hand, food safety authorities and other mainstream sources

646
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:57,659
consider it to be safe. Who can you believe? The truth about aspartame. Is aspartame really dangerous?

647
02:13:59,029 --> 02:14:05,899
Is aspartame a carcinogen? What are the long-term effects of aspartame? Dizziness, depression,

648
02:14:05,899 --> 02:14:13,109
headaches, Alzheimer's. Does aspartame cause inflammation? It's too much info. Your body

649
02:14:13,109 --> 02:14:15,989
cannot process artificial ingredients well, so substances like aspartame and

650
02:14:15,989 --> 02:14:22,649
monosodium glutamate may trigger immune responses. That's too many angles. Too many people. Too many

651
02:14:22,649 --> 02:14:30,039
studies. I have an anti-study. I have a study that's, but what about my study? What's going on?

652
02:14:30,039 --> 02:14:53,050
It's too deep. Fake news. Fake news. MSG is safe. I know, but there's, I don't know. Here's the thing.

653
02:14:53,050 --> 02:14:59,369
I've heard the story about MSG that one guy was mad at some restaurant and he made like a hit piece

654
02:14:59,369 --> 02:15:13,050
on it, right? Something like that. I remember, right? Somebody was like, I got a headache.

655
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:20,220
It has to be from the MSG and not the pack of cigarettes I smoke every day. Of course not.

656
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:25,100
I don't know. It's too many things. There's too many things to know. Too many things to read about.

657
02:15:32,539 --> 02:15:53,189
Long story short, eat a banana. Why is there a giant surge protector out here? It's for the robots.

658
02:15:55,239 --> 02:16:05,579
Uh, what does it say? Islandville Power Authority authorized personnel only. Bananas actually cause

659
02:16:05,579 --> 02:16:10,869
you to die, unfortunately. Guys, I guarantee you there's a study for every single substance that's

660
02:16:10,869 --> 02:16:18,170
ever been invented of why you shouldn't be eating it or drinking it. Studies have shown that if you

661
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:31,989
eat too many bananas, it's going to cause you a potassium overdose. Okay. Is cheese the reason

662
02:16:31,989 --> 02:16:55,340
why you got a bad score on your SATs? Click here. I have enough for a ticket, right? I remember

663
02:16:55,340 --> 02:17:02,360
reading, uh, so everyone's seen that ad and there was a, there was a, somebody wrote an article about

664
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:08,920
this one particular ad. You guys have probably seen it. It's the doctors found this one food

665
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:18,840
that you should never eat. And the image is a bunch of tapeworms and worms in an intestinal track,

666
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:26,700
right? And this person wrote an article about how they clicked on it and they went searching

667
02:17:26,700 --> 02:17:31,850
for this doctor. It was actually a pretty interesting read. I forget what the article was,

668
02:17:31,850 --> 02:17:53,639
but go read it. It was pretty interesting. Is aspartame bat poop? I hate that ad. Advertisements

669
02:17:53,639 --> 02:18:00,469
just make no sense. We live in such a strange world where somebody can just buy ad space

670
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:09,079
and just write just total dog shit and whatever. Doctors found this one thing that makes you live

671
02:18:09,079 --> 02:18:16,620
over a hundred. It does? Yeah. Okay. What is it? Uh, subscribe to this magazine that has nothing

672
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:23,159
to do with anything that we ever told you. What? I want to know the fucking nutrient that makes me

673
02:18:23,159 --> 02:18:32,649
live forever. Oh, well, um, well, I don't even know what you're talking about. What the fuck?

674
02:18:32,649 --> 02:18:51,030
What is that even talking about? I can't believe you can just say anything. Ads work, unfortunately.

675
02:18:52,489 --> 02:18:56,489
Wait, I remember this one. Wait, let's get out here. Out, out, out, out, out. I want to get out.

676
02:18:56,489 --> 02:19:08,899
I want to go to the carnival again because there's other games here. What happened to the audio?

677
02:19:08,899 --> 02:19:41,450
That was fast. Where is the audio? Oh, there it is. Hi. I'm here for your games. By the way.

678
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:49,420
Nevermind. No, I don't want rides. No, no rides. Get them out. I don't want them. I've already read

679
02:19:49,420 --> 02:19:55,020
all these. I want to play the carnival games. There we go. A coin pusher. No, this is just for

680
02:19:55,020 --> 02:20:08,100
prizes. This isn't for tickets. I'm leaving. Was that here before? Was it Ferris wheel here?

681
02:20:15,639 --> 02:20:26,579
Yes. Oh, okay. I have to wait 20 minutes for the next bus. No, I don't. It comes immediately. Ads.

682
02:20:29,719 --> 02:20:36,899
Ad companies are so fun. Not, not fun. Like funny. I mean, I didn't, I didn't finish my sentence

683
02:20:36,899 --> 02:20:43,700
because this guy was driving erratically. Uh, they, first there's a pre-roll ad and

684
02:20:44,260 --> 02:20:46,979
people have found a way. Ad companies have found a way to make it because, you know,

685
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:51,299
they know you're going to skip. So they just front load a ton of info in the first five seconds

686
02:20:51,299 --> 02:20:57,139
and they've paid for 30 second ads, but they just front load everything in the first five seconds.

687
02:20:57,139 --> 02:21:10,260
In the last 25 seconds don't even matter. It's just, they just added film time. Skippable ads

688
02:21:10,260 --> 02:21:22,010
are cheaper. That's true. Still have to pay. Still going to pay for that 30 second slot. It

689
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:40,840
might be a little bit cheaper. Is it going to be Germacraft today? Uh, no. Where's the bus? Oh,

690
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:48,979
I have to call the bus. Whoops. We want ads. We already went over this. There's no reason

691
02:21:48,979 --> 02:21:53,459
for you to play ads on this stream. And there's no reason for anyone to give a shit about ads

692
02:21:54,100 --> 02:22:00,250
that's ever streams or ever maybe on YouTube because I say, I don't know. If I run an ad,

693
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:05,610
75% of you are not going to see it. Half of you have ad block. Half of you may be subbed.

694
02:22:06,629 --> 02:22:17,620
If I run an ad like 20, I'm just making like 400 of you's lives miserable. I'm pretty close

695
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:28,020
to the edge there. Run it in stream. See, that's the way to get around it. But that's,

696
02:22:29,399 --> 02:22:41,139
I, why would I do that? That's the quickest way to delete a bunch of people that are currently

697
02:22:41,139 --> 02:22:50,739
watching. All right. Where are we going? Uh, Larry's arcade, right? I need a hundred thousand

698
02:22:50,739 --> 02:23:02,540
tickets. Next Barry's pond. All right. I'm going to get off at Barry's pond. I have a lot of cows to

699
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:17,899
sell. Actually just play Raid Shadow Legends on stream. Do that. There are, there are no pros to

700
02:23:17,899 --> 02:23:32,299
that. There's only cons. I can't think of more than one potential pro to that. That would be

701
02:23:32,299 --> 02:23:40,200
a funny stream for maybe five minutes. And then I'm playing Raid Shadow Legends on stream. I

702
02:23:45,290 --> 02:24:03,290
use other door. You played numbers go, Jesus Christ. What is this? What? Hold on. Somebody

703
02:24:03,290 --> 02:24:33,270
just left a car. Who left a scratch ticket out here? I want eight bucks. Where's the other door?

704
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:44,739
Where's the use the other door? Oh, they're talking about the on the left. What the that's

705
02:24:46,340 --> 02:25:04,979
all right. Let's get it in there. How much is one of these worth? Five dollars.

706
02:25:05,700 --> 02:26:10,229
Oh, that's not worth it. I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I'll go get him. I'll go get him.

707
02:26:10,229 --> 02:26:28,569
He's right here. He's right here. I'm sorry. I'll never do that again. I'm sorry. I'll never do it

708
02:26:28,569 --> 02:27:06,139
again. Whose house is this? Run his head over. Holy shit. Wow, we found the psycho. It's me? No,

709
02:27:06,139 --> 02:27:28,280
it's not. I didn't say that. Whose house is this? My house now. Is it? Is it my house? This goes

710
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:34,309
from being a fun arcade game to being really scary. Who's this dude outside shining a flashlight in

711
02:27:34,309 --> 02:27:46,040
our windows? They're casing our house. Okay, I can't get in here. Where's my house? There's no door.

712
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:57,180
This game has slender energy. You're robbing a house for arcade money.

713
02:27:57,739 --> 02:28:05,670
I don't even know where the hell I'm going. I guess we're going to check out that house.

714
02:28:05,670 --> 02:28:16,040
I was supposed to go to the other arcade. Is it? Can I go in that house? Look at the map.

715
02:28:19,219 --> 02:28:26,950
All right. Where am I? Bus stop. What is that? Home. What about my? Oh, shit. About my limo.

716
02:28:30,889 --> 02:28:53,590
I really am a rich kid. Did he go over the edge? He just drove off the cliff.

717
02:28:58,540 --> 02:29:09,000
Oh, well, sorry. Where's the basketball? I know you can play it. You have to. All right. I forgot.

718
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:19,430
Here's my achievements. Cool. Here's my fucking gamer fridge that I have behind me.

719
02:29:20,229 --> 02:29:44,840
Why do I have a giant map of the town? That's weird. Sell your gamer fridge. Who the fuck is

720
02:29:44,840 --> 02:30:16,469
this? Angel duck. This duck food? Come get your food. What the hell is going on? Oh, the duck eats?

721
02:30:19,829 --> 02:30:42,500
How do you pet duck? Can you pet duck? I want to pet the duck. Force choke.

722
02:30:56,100 --> 02:31:06,870
He's all right. Is he? Yes, he's fine. Mommy's little angel.

723
02:31:10,090 --> 02:31:17,290
Ducks don't sleep. Wait. 105th annual swan goose show. Swim contest. Best feathers. Loudest quack.

724
02:31:17,290 --> 02:31:24,170
Featuring special guest. 2028 grand champion. Gary from Islandville. 20 dollar autographs.

725
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:34,700
That's Gary. He's famous. Mainland arena. May 5th. 25 dollar general admission. He's famous.

726
02:31:39,299 --> 02:31:54,170
Wow. You actually have a duck. That's so cool. All right. Don't overfeed Gary. I was going to

727
02:31:54,170 --> 02:32:00,040
put food in the blender. I can't microwave his food or my food. Can I eat that food?

728
02:32:11,989 --> 02:32:26,540
This is awesome. Pawn Gary. You can't. Why would I pawn Gary? We're just like hanging out together.

729
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:32,940
I'm not force choking Gary. We're walking around together.

730
02:32:38,889 --> 02:32:57,079
You're hurting him. I'm not hurting him. Look, we're hanging out in bed. Oops. Sorry, Gary. Wait.

731
02:33:00,229 --> 02:33:15,479
No. I want to hang out with you. This is my room. Cool. Can I use that? This definitely was not here

732
02:33:15,479 --> 02:33:28,889
the last time I played. You have an entire house. I can't. Can I go to the bathroom?

733
02:33:29,450 --> 02:33:53,719
That's a nice shower. Turn off the lights and go upstairs. Okay. Put Gary in toilet. Now,

734
02:33:53,719 --> 02:34:04,489
that's something I'm not going to do. I need to turn the lights off. Was the lights switched

735
02:34:04,489 --> 02:34:17,879
from here? It should be right here. What happened to it? Oh, hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. You're

736
02:34:17,879 --> 02:34:29,799
blocking the way. Go up or down. Come on, Gary. Where's the light? There's no lights. Oh, here we

737
02:34:29,799 --> 02:35:30,010
go. Ooh, Gary. Gary. Fuck. All right. Bye, Gary. It was fun hanging out with you. That's kind of

738
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:40,170
a cool thing. You have a house. You missed a room. Double D. What? Double D. Where? Put Gary in your

739
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:46,459
inventory. I can't put Gary in my inventory. He doesn't go in there. In the bathroom. What do

740
02:35:46,459 --> 02:35:52,680
you mean? How could there be another room in the bathroom? Don't hit Gary with the flashlight.

741
02:35:54,680 --> 02:36:12,229
Gary, what are you doing in here? What do you want? Hi. Yes. Yes. Move. We need to give you a bath.

742
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:22,379
How do you give a duck a bath if they're in your... Give them a bath. No, ducks bathe themselves,

743
02:36:22,379 --> 02:36:35,780
guys. Yeah, ducks bathe themselves. They bathe themselves. You don't wash a duck. You don't like,

744
02:36:35,780 --> 02:36:41,059
oh, I put you in a bathtub with soap and water. No, no, no. A duck just goes to water and they

745
02:36:41,059 --> 02:36:48,299
smash their face into it and roll and they throw their head up in the air. I've seen it. Where's

746
02:36:48,299 --> 02:36:55,420
this other room you're talking about? They put their head underwater. They swish their face around

747
02:36:55,420 --> 02:37:00,379
and they put their face in the air and they go... They go like this. You never seen a duck bathe

748
02:37:00,379 --> 02:37:09,129
before? Here's the duck's arm, right? This is the duck's arm. No, this is the duck's face. Yes. Hi.

749
02:37:09,129 --> 02:37:13,610
How are you? Good to see you. This is the duck's face. They go under. Let's say that this line

750
02:37:13,610 --> 02:37:19,690
in here is the water level. Yes, and we're talking about you. Yes. When they go under...

751
02:37:21,610 --> 02:37:27,450
Okay, he's funny. When they go under, they... Yeah, go ahead and do it. When they go under,

752
02:37:27,450 --> 02:37:33,100
they go boom, under the water, up and they go... They drink the water on their heads. They go...

753
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:41,479
They go... Very good job. That's exactly what they do. Yes, you're... Oh, yes, you're...

754
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:47,559
Good. Okay. Yes, you just wanted to kiss me. Okay, good. I see. Yeah, he's doing very good.

755
02:38:03,430 --> 02:38:10,250
Where's the door that you're talking about? Do I not even have cable?

756
02:38:13,049 --> 02:38:36,309
Wait, are you... We watch... Oh, we watch TV together? There's nothing on TV, Gary. It's his

757
02:38:36,389 --> 02:38:56,469
favorite show. Hey, what? Did he just try to turn it back on? It's back... Gary, it's back on.

758
02:38:57,590 --> 02:39:38,979
Your favorite show is back on. White screen. Don't you like it? Yes, I love this show. Hey,

759
02:39:38,979 --> 02:39:55,579
I was... I was watching that. Gary, to the left of the fridge. Oh, there is another door here.

760
02:39:55,579 --> 02:40:08,920
You can't go in this door. Thanks for the bait. All right, I gotta go win more tickets before...

761
02:40:08,920 --> 02:40:19,670
I need 30... I need 70,000 more tickets. I can call my limo driver, right? Why would I take the

762
02:40:19,670 --> 02:40:34,860
bus? Who are these people? Wait, did I just get... Did I just get like a luxury Uber? Shared luxury

763
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:51,000
Uber or something? Happy birthday. Whose birthday is this? They... They partied themselves out of

764
02:40:51,000 --> 02:42:00,620
existence. The fuck up. Birthday sucks. All right, I don't... I don't want... I don't want it. I don't

765
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:06,940
want it. I don't do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it.

766
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:10,219
Oh, I forgot. I remember these. Some of these are new. Some of these are new.

767
02:42:10,219 --> 02:42:18,469
What is this? This is new. This is letters. Some of these are new. Oh, I remember this sand game.

768
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:37,690
This sand game is fun. What happened? Oh, you can't touch the middle. You can't touch the middle. I

769
02:42:37,690 --> 02:42:46,809
remember. This one's fun. I think... I remember I tried to win this, but it's almost impossible to

770
02:42:46,809 --> 02:43:03,319
win. Did I actually just try to rage quit the game? No. No, no, no. I need 70,000 more tickets.

771
02:43:03,319 --> 02:43:19,690
This is not... Not efficient. Get out. Dunco? New. Dunco. Wait, have I done this one? Is this one new?

772
02:43:20,329 --> 02:43:46,729
No, I remember this one. Yeah, I've done this one. Here's some Dunco donuts. Because you're

773
02:43:46,729 --> 02:44:00,100
a rabbit. I'm sorry. What's the over-under on that? Is that like meme dead at this point,

774
02:44:00,100 --> 02:44:11,989
and maybe everybody hates it, or people still think it's funny? I'm not sure yet. Oh, they got

775
02:44:11,989 --> 02:44:31,209
stuck. 1,000 tickets and a free prize? What's the free prize? I don't remember there being a free

776
02:44:31,209 --> 02:44:48,600
prize. We'll have to check that out. I think it's the cards, right? Bonus. Oh. All right, we've got

777
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:55,129
to get these three. We've got to get three tickets. There we go. Bang, bang. What is it? I need all

778
02:44:55,129 --> 02:45:00,540
the cards. I've got to get them all. What does it say? What do I have? Okay, I need red and blue.

779
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:14,489
Red and blue, and then I'm done. Give me a red spawn. You get a Dunco mascot suit?

780
02:45:15,209 --> 02:45:22,540
No, you get the plush. That's pretty cool. Oh, that's all right. It's going to put these down,

781
02:45:22,540 --> 02:45:26,620
and I'm going to get the blue card. Give us Dizzy Bird? I'll do Dizzy Bird in a minute.

782
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:34,280
Get it for Gary. I will. We're going to do this in another time. We're going to do...

783
02:45:35,079 --> 02:45:42,739
Okay, good. This should be enough to get the red card as well. I need a black card. Oh,

784
02:45:42,739 --> 02:45:50,180
shit. I need more than that. Anything but the bird game. But I already beat the bird game,

785
02:45:50,180 --> 02:46:04,139
so it doesn't matter. Go to the right... I know, I know, I know, I know. I was trying to get the

786
02:46:04,139 --> 02:46:33,129
blue card. Oh. He knows he can't do it again. Yeah, I know I can't do it again. That's okay.

787
02:46:35,959 --> 02:46:42,649
It's like what we talked about before. Like Jump King, right? Oh, do the Jump King DLC.

788
02:46:42,649 --> 02:46:48,170
It's really hard, and it's crazy, and you could like it. No, I know I'm not going to do that

789
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:56,729
ever again. I've seen streams and streamers and clips of people on those DLC levels,

790
02:46:58,440 --> 02:47:10,760
and I know what I'm capable of. It's not that. It's not that. You spoiled it.

791
02:47:16,229 --> 02:47:19,270
Look at this card. It's right here. How can I not get the one all the way to the left?

792
02:47:20,069 --> 02:47:35,059
I got the dunko card. It took XQC 60 hours to beat the game. Yeah. Oh, I can feel...

793
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:50,840
I can feel that pain. I just can. That's a lot of time. That's a lot. Can I get another push,

794
02:47:50,840 --> 02:48:01,989
please? All right, we get a black card and we need a red one. Jeremy, can I have some tokens? No.

795
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:17,799
Get your run. Just kidding. Here's 50. Go play Dunky, whatever a thing is, as long as you want.

796
02:48:19,159 --> 02:48:25,930
Okay, we need the red card. Spawn a red card so I can stop playing this, please.

797
02:48:26,569 --> 02:48:46,549
Spawn a truck? I don't think those are in this game. Give me another card. There's a red card

798
02:48:46,549 --> 02:49:00,549
over there, but it's not going to count. Oh, I got it. All right, card. That's not bad.

799
02:49:01,430 --> 02:49:20,520
I don't need a green one. I need a red one. Spawn another one. Let's go. Card. Card. Left machine

800
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:36,629
is a red card. Yeah, but it only counts for the machine it's currently on. I need one red. Gotta

801
02:49:36,629 --> 02:49:54,899
just get this thing to spin. Spin. Bonus. Oh, yeah. Super bonus. Is it seven free spins times two?

802
02:49:55,860 --> 02:50:01,059
10 free spins times two. We need 20 times three. I'll take that. That's not horrible.

803
02:50:02,180 --> 02:50:18,409
That's better. That's much better. No. No! This is time. Holy shit, this is times two, guys.

804
02:50:19,290 --> 02:50:30,700
This shit's times three times three. I imagined that was times three. I want red.

805
02:50:32,540 --> 02:50:44,940
Jeremy, please. Jeremy, I'll click it in like an hour. Land on bonus again.

806
02:50:45,819 --> 02:51:03,180
Damn it. Fuck. I need a red card. Oh, my God. I'm seeing Omega Lulz. So let me go ahead and click

807
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:13,719
it. Is this the one you wanted me to click on? There's like three links in here. It's all the

808
02:51:13,719 --> 02:51:24,549
different TV channels. All right, I see it. Okay, cool. You know, when you see Omega Lulz in your

809
02:51:24,549 --> 02:51:32,920
chat, you have to react. Daily News 10. Find out what wrong with these five foods you eat every day.

810
02:51:33,479 --> 02:51:51,059
Worms. Elephant roars like a dinosaur. Crisp Pratt accidentally gives away

811
02:51:51,620 --> 02:52:19,059
travel trivia prize? What are, what is this? That's Crisp. He's trying to react to them.

812
02:52:21,139 --> 02:52:31,559
I don't know how you guys do this shit so quickly. Yeah, I saw the McChicken one.

813
02:52:31,559 --> 02:52:38,790
The best fast food sandwich. I don't even know what these images are. There's too many of these.

814
02:52:40,219 --> 02:52:45,500
Like 20 minutes has gone by and you got this. There's like seven new photoshops in the chat.

815
02:52:45,500 --> 02:53:00,260
I can't keep up. The Junior Chicken is better. Oh, excuse me. No, it's not.

816
02:53:01,059 --> 02:53:18,180
The best fast food. I'm trying to move with my mouse. The McChicken from McDonald's. Just plain.

817
02:53:18,180 --> 02:53:21,860
Just the way it comes. Just McChicken with lettuce, a little bit of mayo.

818
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:27,100
It's the best. Just when you're hungry, you can eat like six of them.

819
02:53:30,309 --> 02:53:35,989
And look, I'm not, this is, I'm not counting like, Oh, what about Chick-fil-A? What about Popeyes?

820
02:53:35,989 --> 02:53:45,719
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not having that fight. Everybody knows that Chick-fil-A is better

821
02:53:45,719 --> 02:53:50,600
than everything. Like I know that. I, I know that. Okay. I already know, but I can't, you don't eat,

822
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:55,639
I can't eat, you can't eat Chick-fil-A every day. You can eat McDonald's every day. Why would you

823
02:53:55,719 --> 02:54:07,590
want to do that? But you, that's like the worst thing I've said. That's a terrible statement.

824
02:54:08,709 --> 02:54:13,590
You don't want to eat McDonald's every day. You, you technically can. What I mean by that is,

825
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:21,270
this is what I mean. Chick-fil-A is sort of, it's a treat in quotes because it's not everywhere.

826
02:54:21,270 --> 02:54:28,299
There's a McDonald's every one mile. Some places across the country have maybe one Chick-fil-A in

827
02:54:28,299 --> 02:54:34,059
50 miles. So it's, yes, you, you, what are you going to drive to Chick-fil-A fucking 50 miles

828
02:54:34,059 --> 02:54:56,659
every day? That's what I meant by that statement. Good thing I have clarified that. Red card. Red

829
02:54:56,659 --> 02:55:14,459
card please. Just eat McDonald's every day. Chicken's unimpressive. Yeah, but it's, it's easy.

830
02:55:27,610 --> 02:55:34,760
Go left. No, I need to get to zero. All right. Okay. I gotta, I have to move on. I can't do this

831
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:41,020
all day. I have to move on. Where are my tickets? All right. Here we go. Good, good, good, good,

832
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:52,440
good, good. Yes. Fuck you. No, don't do five. All right. We're at a good spot.

833
02:55:54,020 --> 02:56:23,860
Give me a shitload and give me a red card so I can get out of here. Red. It's not red. Yellow.

834
02:56:27,079 --> 02:56:44,860
Give me a red card. That's a yellow card. How many times am I going to get yellow and blue?

835
02:56:47,450 --> 02:57:21,420
Red. Oh my God. I just want the red. This is how they keep you here. Bonus. Oh fucking yeah.

836
02:57:22,299 --> 02:57:24,860
Yes. Yup. All right. 20.

837
02:57:31,770 --> 02:57:39,590
All right. We got 11. Don't want it. There's no way there's a seven this close. There it is.

838
02:57:42,520 --> 02:57:50,840
Do I know for a fact that the cards don't carry over? No. I mean, there's three different machines

839
02:57:50,840 --> 02:57:54,200
here that have three different numbers on them right now. I assume it has to be like that.

840
02:58:05,819 --> 02:58:19,540
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red. Yeah. Guys, we did it. You and I, we did it.

841
02:58:21,959 --> 02:58:35,559
And there's two. I can get two ducks. Make it three. Put a third one down here. Too good to be true.

842
02:58:35,559 --> 02:58:57,559
Too good to be true. Well, let's get it. We get Gary two. That's actually not an untrue statement.

843
02:58:59,049 --> 02:59:05,979
Bonus. All right. Here comes the first duck. We're going to get two or three ducks.

844
02:59:11,350 --> 02:59:15,750
All right. Come on. Got it. Thousand tickets and a free prize. Where is it?

845
02:59:17,700 --> 02:59:24,709
Wait, I already got one? This would be number three.

846
02:59:24,709 --> 02:59:44,700
Where do I get the free prize from? Is it? What happened to the cards? Oh, they reset. Okay. All

847
02:59:44,700 --> 02:59:48,920
right. All right. All right. All right. We don't even. Hold on. This is important. Here's how we

848
02:59:49,479 --> 03:00:01,319
wait one second. Because, uh, red, green, black. Okay. Hold on. Just, I'm just going to see what

849
03:00:01,319 --> 03:00:10,950
happens. If a yellow card drops, then I'm going to wait. There's yellow and blue over here.

850
03:00:11,829 --> 03:00:24,620
Well, first, let me go see, make sure I can even get this prize. I'm owed two. I'm technically,

851
03:00:24,620 --> 03:00:32,340
I'm owed two prizes. Yellow and blue is right there. Let's see if you guys are right. See if

852
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:55,930
it carries over. Might be the final push. Let me get my prize. He's a dunko addict, just like grandma.

853
03:00:55,930 --> 03:01:02,819
Holy shit. That's a lot of tickets. A lot of tickets. A lot of tickets. Let's test it. No,

854
03:01:02,819 --> 03:02:01,850
they all reset. They reset. Where's my free prizes? Where are they? Oh shit. All right. I've got,

855
03:02:01,850 --> 03:02:14,760
how many tickets do I got now? 37,000. Almost there. We're at 37%. All right. I'm going to do

856
03:02:14,760 --> 03:02:19,000
this one. I'm going to try this one again. I like this one. This one's fun. As long as you pay

857
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:43,819
attention. All right. I'm trying to go too quick. Slow it down. The trick to this game is you let

858
03:02:43,819 --> 03:02:49,139
it bounce once and then you do it on the second return. If you wait longer than that, you're not

859
03:02:49,139 --> 03:02:53,479
going to get it because your brain can't keep up with it. You can only keep up with one turn.

860
03:02:54,120 --> 03:03:33,530
It speeds up at that last two. Is this a rerun? No, it's not a rerun. I just wanted to come back

861
03:03:33,530 --> 03:03:42,059
here. I have to, I'm just trying to get some, ah, it's not a rerun. There's a new arcade that

862
03:03:42,059 --> 03:03:45,340
we went to. 15 new games. I'm just checking out some of the old ones, some of the new stuff that

863
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:50,299
they put in. They put some new stuff in. I'm just checking it out. If there's some stuff in here

864
03:03:50,299 --> 03:03:56,889
that's new, there's, I'm just checking it out. And you play some old stuff to just when you're

865
03:03:56,889 --> 03:04:42,579
checking something out, he's re, I'm re-recording. Why did I think that was going to be too,

866
03:04:43,219 --> 03:05:13,799
what the fuck am I doing? This is what, that nerd neck. How do I get out of this? Oh, it's C.

867
03:05:18,149 --> 03:06:03,930
Hold on. What? Oh, I remember this one. This one's fun. Here we go. Ready? You are slow. I got it.

868
03:06:07,879 --> 03:06:26,840
Oh, oh, oh, what's happening? My graphics card's dying. My graphics card's dying. This, this dream

869
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:37,020
might turn off. Are you guys seeing that? Are you guys seeing that? Green artifacts are all over

870
03:06:37,020 --> 03:06:58,229
my screen. No, you guys, it's not pulling it. Uh-oh. Oh shit. It's only this game that's doing it.

871
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:24,280
Fuck, yeah. Dead. It's like, the graphics card's fucking with me. Is it actually? Oh, it is my,

872
03:07:24,280 --> 03:08:17,059
okay. Uh, he's in the matrix. I know what it is. I fix it. I fix it. I fix it. Quick, eat the red

873
03:08:17,059 --> 03:08:31,799
pill. No, but the blue one's probably blueberry. Hold on. I actually have to, my monitor just turned

874
03:08:31,799 --> 03:08:40,649
off. Oh, my cord was loose. It's okay. I fixed it. We're good to go. My monitor's just fucking

875
03:08:40,649 --> 03:08:46,889
turned off. Come on. What are you doing? Stop. Why is my monitor doing this? Does my cable suck?

876
03:08:49,590 --> 03:09:00,920
I'll do it. Oh, stop it. Ha ha. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. What are you talking about?

877
03:09:05,540 --> 03:09:36,280
I gotta pee. I'm gonna take this again. Where are the balls going, Jerma? Where are the balls going?

878
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:42,889
I don't know. What's more efficient, this or the spinny jackpot thing? What do you think?

879
03:09:43,989 --> 03:10:11,959
I gotta pee. Go to the bathroom now. No. All right, let's go. Streamer shits himself on stream.

880
03:10:11,959 --> 03:10:17,030
I don't have to shit. I'm not gonna, I don't, I'm not gonna disappear for like 30 minutes.

881
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:46,620
Who shits for 30 minutes? I don't even start with this nonsense. It really depends.

882
03:10:47,260 --> 03:11:06,389
How much time do I have? Yeah, it depends on how much time I have. Do I have,

883
03:11:07,450 --> 03:11:27,659
how many, how many hours do I have before I have to do something? It's in. I wish I could just put

884
03:11:27,659 --> 03:11:39,100
in like 10 credits worth. You know, this one's not even winnable unless the person who,

885
03:11:40,299 --> 03:11:43,260
you know, these machines have to take in $1,000 sometimes before they do anything.

886
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:58,440
There'll be a PlayStation 4 up there or a Nintendo DS. How much is a Nintendo DS?

887
03:12:00,180 --> 03:12:07,610
Like what? 200? How much is 3DS? Like 150? 200 bucks? All right, so let's say it's $200.

888
03:12:08,569 --> 03:12:15,899
For the Nintendo DS to be able to be won, like it depends on who owns the machine,

889
03:12:15,899 --> 03:12:21,100
but for the most part it's usually at least two or three times the amount of money has to come in.

890
03:12:22,040 --> 03:12:27,000
So these prizes on the top row that's a Nintendo DS, wow, it's $2 a dollar to play this.

891
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:36,700
600 bucks has to come in sometimes for this to happen and you also have to win. You also have

892
03:12:36,780 --> 03:12:46,969
to win the actual game of skill once they allow you to be able to win. It's not RNG. No,

893
03:12:47,610 --> 03:12:55,260
play my favorite game here. Inside of Secrets. That's illegal. You know what's funny? Why is

894
03:12:55,260 --> 03:13:05,370
that legal? It's not actually a game of skill if you put, is that supposed to be legal? Why is

895
03:13:05,370 --> 03:13:23,879
that legal? It's not technically gambling. Not even close, not even close, not even close.

896
03:13:35,260 --> 03:13:42,920
I love this game. Hey, it's my first stream here. You're top 10 underrated streamers. Oh, cool.

897
03:13:42,920 --> 03:14:08,809
Welcome. You missed some of that. What? Too much. Oh, I have to get green once. I love green.

898
03:14:09,450 --> 03:14:25,530
Did I get green? I got, how did I get green? What? I wasn't even looking. Why would it give

899
03:14:25,530 --> 03:14:31,030
me a bonus? Jeremy, you've been playing the chicken game since July. Please stop.

900
03:14:36,379 --> 03:15:08,440
I did it. Yeah, he said it. I've seen the video. You know how hard it is to avoid some of these

901
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:15,610
videos? Hey, click this link. What is this? It's called, okay, cool. I don't want to watch this

902
03:15:15,610 --> 03:15:27,129
right now. I'm busy. Imagine getting that message for six straight years. You have to apologize for

903
03:15:27,129 --> 03:15:40,139
that. Wait, what? Wait, why? Why? I have to apologize? I have to apologize.

904
03:15:50,090 --> 03:15:57,129
We need a public apology. All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

905
03:15:58,010 --> 03:16:05,500
Well, I can do an impression. I can do a shitty impression of Larry David, but I can't do like,

906
03:16:06,059 --> 03:16:25,020
oh yeah. I can't say that. I'm like, apologize again. I'm not even, I don't even understand.

907
03:16:27,030 --> 03:16:33,670
I was, I was like mocking the meme and now I have to apologize for mocking the meme.

908
03:16:34,629 --> 03:16:45,850
No, no, no apology. Nope. Not gonna happen. No, I'm going, I'm buried. I'm getting buried with this

909
03:16:45,850 --> 03:16:56,299
one. I'm getting buried. They're going to be burying me in like another 75 years. And the

910
03:16:56,299 --> 03:17:01,500
elves impersonator that I've hired to do the talk at the end of your life thing, you're going to be

911
03:17:01,500 --> 03:18:01,579
like, oh well it seems that this boy, I'm not apologizing for it. I'm not apologizing for

912
03:18:01,579 --> 03:18:10,280
saying it. I'm not apologizing. I'm not apologizing for saying I, oh, you said the meme thing. No,

913
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:18,940
no apologies from here. I'm going to sleep with it. Apologize for what? I, if you weren't,

914
03:18:18,940 --> 03:18:25,739
if you weren't here like two minutes ago, somebody said ayaya in the chat and I did like a,

915
03:18:25,739 --> 03:18:30,860
like a look, it's the, it's the thing, it's the video and people freaked out and now they demanded

916
03:18:30,860 --> 03:19:02,729
apology. Apologize. I actually uploaded a video to my main channel and it opens up with me with like

917
03:19:02,729 --> 03:19:07,610
music playing like guys. I just want to say a couple things. I'm, first of all, it's a hard

918
03:19:07,610 --> 03:19:18,680
video to make. I'm really sorry. I said ayaya. I did like a thing where I pretended to be the

919
03:19:18,680 --> 03:19:34,620
video for like, like at most six seconds and everybody tried to burn my house down and they

920
03:19:34,620 --> 03:19:39,180
screamed at me and they called me a bunch of fucking names and idiot and stupid and they,

921
03:19:39,180 --> 03:19:42,540
and they, they, they're screaming at me, but I'm the one that has to apologize now.

922
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:48,139
So, uh, here you go. Uh, I guess I'm, I guess if you're bad, if you're mad about that, then

923
03:19:48,139 --> 03:20:03,459
sorry to hear that. It's an emoticon. The passive aggressive apology, the passive aggressive

924
03:20:03,459 --> 03:20:19,780
non-apology. Apologize now. Apologize. All right. I have to get the fuck out of this

925
03:20:20,659 --> 03:20:25,219
before I put on the video and sing to it at the same time, just to punish you.

926
03:20:26,020 --> 03:20:41,510
Oh, now everybody wants me to do that. I'll do it. Do it. Do it. Oh, I'll do that. Do it. No,

927
03:20:41,510 --> 03:20:46,860
do that. Do that. Do it. Do it. These are the people that just demanded an apology because

928
03:20:46,860 --> 03:20:59,780
I said the word out loud. Unbelievable. Pick a side guys. It was an empty threat. I'm doing

929
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:23,829
this one more time and I'm moving on. Oh, it's glitched up there. All right. Goodbye. Please

930
03:21:23,829 --> 03:21:32,149
tickets. Do it or you're not going to get any gifted subs ever again. Enable the, I enable

931
03:21:32,149 --> 03:21:38,620
that emote for punishment. No, no, I'm not going to enable an emote. What was I thinking saying

932
03:21:38,620 --> 03:21:51,079
that out loud? I of course saying the word, saying the A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A out loud to a large

933
03:21:51,079 --> 03:21:57,479
amount of people in this chat apparently is as if I turned on the webcam and was just naked

934
03:22:00,309 --> 03:22:18,440
going like, yeah, look at this. Wait, look at me. What? Compact empty threats. I got it.

935
03:22:24,260 --> 03:22:30,149
It's worse than that. It's not. All right. That's it. That's it. I can't, I've already beaten this

936
03:22:30,149 --> 03:22:33,590
once. I don't have to beat it again. This actually is a rerun stream. If I stay here,

937
03:22:34,229 --> 03:22:38,709
play the video. I'm not playing the video. No, no. Okay. Just delete the last five minutes.

938
03:22:39,590 --> 03:22:49,290
Just pretend the last five minutes on stream didn't happen. You know what I mean? Like we can

939
03:22:49,290 --> 03:23:03,139
just get over that. That the last five, the last five minutes did not happen. You know what I'm

940
03:23:03,139 --> 03:23:26,010
saying? The last five minutes didn't happen. The most polarizing moment. All right. 40,000 tickets.

941
03:23:26,010 --> 03:23:34,870
I almost just did it. I almost just went, I almost just went, I almost did it again.

942
03:23:45,049 --> 03:24:03,190
Oh my God. Can you believe that Trevor lied about what? Give me those headphones. Give me

943
03:24:03,989 --> 03:24:16,459
those headphones. All right. I'm good. I did it. Out, out, out. It was fucking easy. All right.

944
03:24:16,459 --> 03:24:22,860
Let's go to Bass. Pull it. And we're going back to the other casino.

945
03:24:28,870 --> 03:24:41,850
Do it. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets. What is cuckoo clock? I've never seen cuckoo clock.

946
03:24:41,850 --> 03:24:55,190
Let's do cuckoo clock. This shit is impossible. I don't know why people even play this.

947
03:24:58,809 --> 03:25:10,819
There's no reason to play this. Yeah, I said this last time. Get me out of this. What a dumb game.

948
03:25:12,040 --> 03:25:19,379
And for some reason, also, every arcade now, there's got to be some weird deal with this company.

949
03:25:19,940 --> 03:25:25,860
Whoever manufactures this shit, because it's one of the only games at most arcades with this

950
03:25:25,860 --> 03:25:33,670
10 of them in a row. 10 of them. And there's always people playing them. Every machine is

951
03:25:33,670 --> 03:25:49,479
loaded with people waiting in line. Are they paid actors? And they're like, it's like six bucks to

952
03:25:49,479 --> 03:25:57,020
play this. So they're just playing for free. And then you go, oh, I think I want to do that. And

953
03:25:57,020 --> 03:26:00,780
they go, oh, I guess you're gonna have a turn. I almost won a thousand. And you spend 30 bucks

954
03:26:00,780 --> 03:26:56,409
here and then you leave and they made 30 dollars. All right, let's go. Cash out. 40,234 tickets.

955
03:26:56,409 --> 03:27:00,409
Let's go back to the other arcade and have some fun. But first, let's listen to the fun song.

956
03:27:00,409 --> 03:27:10,600
Remember the funny song? Here we go. It's time for the funny song. Where's the funny song?

957
03:27:16,549 --> 03:27:25,959
Never mind. I can't. No. All right, let's go. Limo driver, please take me to the other

958
03:27:26,680 --> 03:27:48,389
casino, please. Uh huh. Let's go to the UFO. Just scream at us already. Jesus, I've been waiting

959
03:27:48,389 --> 03:27:57,260
for hours. What? Scream at us? Why am I screaming at you? I didn't even play this one. Are you

960
03:27:57,260 --> 03:28:10,010
serious? I didn't play the clock tower. What does this one do? Ball drops. Oh, it's this thing. You

961
03:28:10,010 --> 03:28:31,770
have to. Damn it. All right. 500. I hate this thing too. Why is it always the worst ones that

962
03:28:31,770 --> 03:28:38,309
take up the most amount of space? This is a small apartment. You could live in the spot that this

963
03:28:38,309 --> 03:28:44,620
thing takes up in the casino, in the arcade. Why does it have to take this much time? I mean,

964
03:28:44,620 --> 03:28:59,770
this much space. I got to at least win the 500. I wasn't even ready. That's not fair.

965
03:29:00,649 --> 03:29:49,059
That's unfair. Why is everybody doing question marks? What? You could have had 500. I mean,

966
03:29:49,059 --> 03:29:54,729
it's hard to control. This one's this one. This one's a waste. I could get so much more tickets

967
03:29:54,729 --> 03:30:08,260
playing the spaceship or anything. All right. Hold on. Two balls. There we go. I have infinite

968
03:30:08,260 --> 03:30:32,979
money though. No, I don't. I'm empty. That should be a thousand. Oh, why? I need money.

969
03:30:33,850 --> 03:34:06,840
All right. I gotta pee. I forgot to pee. Let's pee first. I'll be right back. One of these days

970
03:34:06,840 --> 03:34:11,739
might be funny if I'm like, oh, I'm going to go take a break. And it's been like three,

971
03:34:11,739 --> 03:34:18,170
four hours on stream. I go take a break. I'm just going to go pee. And then I come back

972
03:34:18,170 --> 03:34:22,329
and it's a new video feed. And it's just me IRL like going through the McDonald's drive-through.

973
03:34:23,290 --> 03:34:38,569
And I come back and we just go back to what we were doing. Maybe you'll see that someday.

974
03:34:38,569 --> 03:34:50,329
All right. Back to it. 40,000 tickets. I need a hundred. We know how to get that. We know how

975
03:34:50,329 --> 03:35:04,180
to get that. Oh, no money. Solve that real quick. No, wait. That's not money. That's tickets. Where's

976
03:35:04,180 --> 03:35:16,420
the it's where is it? Take over here. Don't even eat the food. Why would I not eat the food?

977
03:35:17,299 --> 03:35:35,299
He's becoming delirious. Now check this out. We're going to get the other 60,000 tickets real soon.

978
03:35:36,340 --> 03:35:54,920
Friendship ended with German. Now Drew Crew is my best friend. I'm part of that crew. Yes,

979
03:35:54,920 --> 03:36:00,520
this is just a money printing machine. From what I understand, when this game actually releases,

980
03:36:01,239 --> 03:36:06,440
when it truly launches and it's actually in 1.0, there's going to be another game mode called

981
03:36:06,440 --> 03:36:12,780
survival where you cannot just print money. You need to do jobs and stuff. I think they really

982
03:36:12,780 --> 03:36:20,889
want it to be an interesting, weird survival game from what I understand. All right, let's do it.

983
03:36:24,170 --> 03:36:37,139
Here we go. Kids gambling survival. Hey, well, you gotta hand it to them. No one's ever done that

984
03:36:37,139 --> 03:36:46,069
before. No one's ever made a kids gambling game. Actually, I have. Oh yes, they have like every

985
03:36:46,069 --> 03:36:50,389
game that's come out. It's been like in the last five years. It's been like a gambling game

986
03:36:50,389 --> 03:37:09,059
just specifically to make kids gamble. What am I talking about? It's all of them like you.

987
03:37:11,079 --> 03:37:22,139
But they're not survival gambling games. Oh, you're right. This one is how you get the tickets.

988
03:37:23,459 --> 03:37:28,340
I'll be there in less than 20 minutes. All right, start counting now. I know people are going to be

989
03:37:28,340 --> 03:37:33,219
like, dude, you're going to be here for 10 straight minutes. Yes, at least. Let me see. Three hours and

990
03:37:33,219 --> 03:38:00,170
37 minutes at three hours and 47 minutes. We'll see where we are. This machine is going to get

991
03:38:00,170 --> 03:38:11,930
nerfed. It probably is. It probably is. This is how you can get tickets quick here. It's 500 every

992
03:38:11,930 --> 03:38:16,809
potentially if you can really time this correctly, 500 tickets every three seconds.

993
03:38:26,379 --> 03:38:34,389
These machines are easy in real life. These machines are rigged in real life.

994
03:38:35,190 --> 03:38:50,020
Evacuate the building. Evacuate. Evacuate this one too many times. This machine is smoking and

995
03:38:50,020 --> 03:39:14,739
setting off the fire alarm. Sparkle Kid? I love Sparkle Kid. Sparkle Kid's awesome.

996
03:39:15,700 --> 03:39:23,540
Yeah, even a robot can't win these. Yeah, because it'll make it move one light forward or one light

997
03:39:23,540 --> 03:39:27,620
backward regardless if you hit it or not. They've tested this with programs.

998
03:39:31,700 --> 03:39:35,940
No, this is not balanced. I spent three hours grinding Dizzy Bird for payout. That wasn't half

999
03:39:35,940 --> 03:40:03,670
of this. Sorry, you gotta get with the meta. At what point do you think somebody that worked

1000
03:40:04,309 --> 03:40:09,270
at this arcade would come over here and be like, what's going on over there? What do you think?

1001
03:40:09,270 --> 03:40:12,229
They would just not even give a shit. Who cares? And just like go back to what they were doing.

1002
03:40:13,190 --> 03:40:37,459
Oh no, I'm becoming more ticket than man. Are you getting paid to stop them? Are you getting

1003
03:40:37,459 --> 03:41:05,850
paid to work here? I'm out of money. Holy shit. All right, this is a lot. Let's see.

1004
03:41:06,889 --> 03:41:17,659
That wasn't even 10 minutes. That was what? Four minutes? That's 8,000 tickets in four minutes.

1005
03:41:19,770 --> 03:41:38,709
Yep, I'm gonna do the money machine like five times in a row. Move on from this lame ass place.

1006
03:41:38,709 --> 03:41:59,049
It's time for the Drew to solve the case. I appreciate the effort on that. Go-karts or

1007
03:41:59,049 --> 03:42:06,010
Riot? I will. I'm gonna bring my hoverboard onto the go-kart track. They won't be able to catch me.

1008
03:42:06,809 --> 03:42:33,750
They'll try. Let's do it. If you hold down a while while playing it, it'll automatically

1009
03:42:33,750 --> 03:42:46,870
start another one so you can get them faster. If you hold down? What? Hold down A.

1010
03:42:46,870 --> 03:43:28,760
Oh my god. Oh, oh, the cops are outside. Oh my Jesus. This game is a disgrace.

1011
03:43:30,600 --> 03:43:49,610
Drew with your face. What? I didn't read that right. I haven't gotten it in like five seconds.

1012
03:43:50,329 --> 03:43:59,049
Oh, that was lame. Stay at this cool arcade. Buy a hoverboard after you are paid.

1013
03:43:59,930 --> 03:44:07,139
That was... Come on. I haven't got one in like five. Come on. It's washed up. No, I'm not. No,

1014
03:44:07,139 --> 03:44:54,549
I'm not. Don't say that. Two, three, four. Out of money. I want to do this in real life.

1015
03:44:55,430 --> 03:45:12,569
Am I allowed to stream in an arcade? Probably not unless I get permission.

1016
03:45:13,209 --> 03:45:25,399
How many was that? And we're not even at 10 minutes. What'd I tell you? What was that?

1017
03:45:25,399 --> 03:45:35,139
8,000 first one. 6,500 for the next one. That's 14. Almost 15,000 tickets in 10 minutes.

1018
03:45:35,139 --> 03:45:38,420
Easy. I'm gonna do this twice in a row so I don't have to leave the machine.

1019
03:45:44,920 --> 03:46:09,500
Yes, you can. Oh, that's cool. All right. Can you actually do that? What's Icelandic for

1020
03:46:09,500 --> 03:46:26,139
degenerate gambler? I don't know. I don't know what it is. What is it? Get back in there.

1021
03:46:26,700 --> 03:46:38,149
This game doesn't take our fancy. It's time to party with Nancy. Play it three more times.

1022
03:46:39,290 --> 03:46:48,899
I'll stop at 200 bucks. Guys, I got like 10 years of streaming to play Nancy Drew.

1023
03:46:48,899 --> 03:47:09,780
And that's how long it's gonna take. He thinks he has 10 years. I got plenty of time. All right,

1024
03:47:09,780 --> 03:47:16,020
one more time and then I'm gonna sit there for like at least 10 to 15 straight minutes. He's

1025
03:47:16,020 --> 03:47:33,370
addicted. Yeah, I'm addicted to getting cool shit. I want to get the hoverboard. Once I get the

1026
03:47:33,370 --> 03:47:46,979
hoverboard then everything's fine. A raid just came in. A huge raid from Boxbox. Boxbox. Hello

1027
03:47:46,979 --> 03:47:58,120
again. Welcome, everybody. Thanks a lot, Boxbox. I'm playing arcade games right now. Boxbox,

1028
03:47:58,120 --> 03:48:15,000
I gotta raid you. When do you stream? Every day? Right now? Well, you can't be streaming

1029
03:48:15,000 --> 03:48:23,770
right now. But hey, welcome, everybody. Thanks a lot, Boxbox. Seriously, that's a lot of people.

1030
03:48:25,430 --> 03:48:29,030
Unfortunately, you came to a stream where the person is just doing this.

1031
03:48:31,510 --> 03:48:35,030
I'm addicted. I'm already addicted. So there's not, I can't say much besides this.

1032
03:48:39,370 --> 03:48:47,829
There it is. That's for Boxbox and his raid. What's that? You want two jackpots?

1033
03:48:48,629 --> 03:48:54,389
You want two jackpots? Oh yeah, you'll take two jackpots. Sure thing. How about three jackpots?

1034
03:48:55,510 --> 03:49:04,659
You want three? I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. You're in follower only mode. Oh

1035
03:49:04,659 --> 03:49:12,459
shit, turn it off. Turn off follower only for like 10 minutes. That's two jackpots in a row.

1036
03:49:13,739 --> 03:49:25,059
Here comes three in a row for you guys. There it is. All right, holding it down is like,

1037
03:49:25,059 --> 03:49:32,409
it's crashing the game. It's too late. Just turn off, you can turn it off. Turn off follower only

1038
03:49:32,409 --> 03:49:42,459
for like 30 minutes. That's too long. I got it all. He's playing elf bowling later. Stick around,

1039
03:49:42,459 --> 03:49:59,350
raiders. Imagine falling asleep. What? They left for another Drew Crews streamer.

1040
03:50:01,940 --> 03:50:10,569
Is my money going up? How do I have? Come on, I'm washed up. I've got to, I can't just suck like

1041
03:50:10,569 --> 03:50:23,420
this. I have to do, we just had a huge raid coming. Come on. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. This is not good.

1042
03:50:37,559 --> 03:50:45,700
I actually did lose it. No, I'm washed up. Oh, I'm really washed up. I might as well quit.

1043
03:50:45,700 --> 03:51:06,649
Never quit. Don't ever quit. Ski ball, ski ball, ski ball. I'll do some ski ball after I spend

1044
03:51:06,649 --> 03:51:36,979
200 on this. That's three in a row. Yeah, what's the most I've ever had? Five in a row. Wish me

1045
03:51:36,979 --> 03:51:42,940
a Merry Christmas. Hey, have a Merry Christmas. Hope you have a good one. Hope you get everything

1046
03:51:42,940 --> 03:51:49,420
you want. Hope Santa doesn't get stuck in your chimney and suffocate because he can't get out

1047
03:51:49,420 --> 03:51:52,940
and he can't reach his cell phone. Because how would you be able to reach your cell phone if

1048
03:51:52,940 --> 03:51:55,819
you got stuck in a chimney? You can't reach down in your pockets. You would just suffocate in the

1049
03:51:55,819 --> 03:52:03,370
chimney. I really hope that doesn't happen to Santa at your house. Because then Santa's lawyers

1050
03:52:03,370 --> 03:52:07,850
might come and find you and they might be like, well, your chimney was not at regulation. Chimney

1051
03:52:07,850 --> 03:52:12,409
is about 15% too small. And you'd be like, I don't know. I mean, you'd lose everything.

1052
03:52:12,409 --> 03:52:35,860
I'm speaking of suffocating.

1053
03:52:41,850 --> 03:52:47,770
Again. Help me. I can't reach my cell phone. I can't reach my cell phone.

1054
03:52:49,780 --> 03:53:06,620
No, no. Yeah.

1055
03:53:18,760 --> 03:53:33,719
I can just do it by feeling. I can close my eyes and do it. Use the force.

1056
03:53:43,540 --> 03:54:27,290
Don't make me put it on and get sued. I'm putting it on. Who cares? Come on. I can do it.

1057
03:54:36,309 --> 03:55:05,819
I can't do it. Come on. Come on. Just think of, just think of Uncle Ben. Wait, that's Spider-Man.

1058
03:55:19,020 --> 03:55:53,260
Yes. German confirmed force sensitive. You think so? Really? I think I am. Let me try. Let's see.

1059
03:55:54,540 --> 03:56:34,549
What the fuck, dude? What the fuck is going on? I think I should go to the academy.

1060
03:56:35,510 --> 03:56:52,500
First joke. Everybody hated that. Why? Why? What? Spoilers, but you can have force powers.

1061
03:56:55,260 --> 03:57:11,690
Oh, the game crashed. Why? Why was that the worst joke ever? Was it?

1062
03:57:14,459 --> 03:57:21,350
To apologize. Sorry again, guys, for a force. The Star Wars bed.

1063
03:57:30,299 --> 03:58:02,889
I actually can't see. I can play. Why can I play like this? What? I turned into a caterpillar.

1064
03:58:10,739 --> 03:58:43,719
Oh my God. My chest hurts. I have to win one. Oh, it fell off. Okay. Do I have no money?

1065
03:58:47,850 --> 03:59:17,819
Oh, it actually moved me. Hey ACDC Freak, thanks for the 5 community subs. Hold F.

1066
03:59:18,780 --> 03:59:52,620
Oh no, those are out of reach. Every last drop. He's going to force, he's force grabbing them.

1067
04:00:02,629 --> 04:00:17,399
14,000 tickets. Holy shit. 70% of the way there, boys and girls. All right, now I'll ride the

1068
04:00:17,399 --> 04:00:27,979
go-karts. No, no, no, no. The box box wanted me to do skee-ball. I'll do that. It's been like,

1069
04:00:27,979 --> 04:00:34,139
it's been like, it's been like 30 minutes. Box box, are you still here? This one's for you.

1070
04:00:34,860 --> 04:01:07,540
Right in the 100. Come on. Box box left an hour ago. Whoa, what was that? Why does that sound like

1071
04:01:07,540 --> 04:01:24,950
I smashed a window? Riven players don't deserve. What? I don't know what that is. What's a Riven

1072
04:01:24,950 --> 04:02:00,120
player? Mist Riven is a good game. Oh, quick play sorting algorithms. Oh, hey, by the way,

1073
04:02:00,120 --> 04:02:04,760
okay. Box box viewers, those of you that are still here, I want to ask a question because my viewers,

1074
04:02:05,479 --> 04:02:09,559
whoa, they fucking yelled at me and called me an asshole and an idiot for this. Listen to me.

1075
04:02:10,500 --> 04:02:15,620
How many times have you, as a box box viewer, right? As somebody that's maybe not,

1076
04:02:15,620 --> 04:02:21,479
never been here before, how many of you have accidentally in skee-ball or in throw the ball

1077
04:02:21,479 --> 04:02:24,920
that the thing knocked his head down? How many times have you thrown a little too hard and it's

1078
04:02:24,920 --> 04:02:35,940
come all the way back and hit you in the chest or something? Apparently, I'm a psycho. How many

1079
04:02:35,940 --> 04:02:39,799
times have you ever done something like this? Like ready? Like, oh shit, I fucked it up and

1080
04:02:39,799 --> 04:02:56,389
it's coming back. That happening to me makes me apparently a serial killer. You killed God yesterday.

1081
04:02:57,610 --> 04:03:09,879
Oh, sorting algorithms. All right, get me out of here, get me out, get me out. Let's go back to my,

1082
04:03:09,879 --> 04:03:20,440
let's go back to my, no, go-karts, go-karts. I'm gonna try to win go-karts. That's normal to be a,

1083
04:03:20,440 --> 04:03:30,149
yeah, I know, that's what I'm saying. All right, what do we got? Session one, 221, gonna be 221.

1084
04:03:39,270 --> 04:03:53,860
All right, let's go. Ready? See if I can beat 221. Do I have to pay for this? No, I do. Let's make it

1085
04:03:53,860 --> 04:04:15,559
clean. I have to get in first place. Were these people on the track before I got here though?

1086
04:04:15,559 --> 04:04:55,430
That's not fair. They had a head start. Session six. Get out of the way. Who threw this can over here?

1087
04:04:56,309 --> 04:05:22,090
Oh, yeah, I did. I don't think you can even get in first place. I don't understand this.

1088
04:05:26,149 --> 04:05:32,520
You know what I'm saying? There's no drivers to be in a position above me.

1089
04:05:33,319 --> 04:05:51,799
This is pretty good. It's a pretty good time. No major screw-ups. Whoa, wait, how did I get

1090
04:05:51,799 --> 04:06:28,620
positioned? Oh shit, I'm in fourth place. Third place, let's go. Out of my way. I'm a 34-year-old

1091
04:06:28,620 --> 04:06:50,280
man. I need to break an 11-year-old's go-kart record. Out of my way. I don't know how you

1092
04:06:50,280 --> 04:07:23,420
do it much better than this. Third place, how? I can still get third place. Experiences.

1093
04:07:25,100 --> 04:07:58,250
What about my experience? Go free camp. I have to hit W, A, S, and D.

1094
04:07:59,530 --> 04:08:13,049
I don't understand. Why are there so many green bean characters? I don't get it.

1095
04:08:13,049 --> 04:08:57,959
Why am I the only human? I can't turn the mouse. He's using his feet to drive.

1096
04:08:58,920 --> 04:09:11,030
He's actually using feet to drive. Why can I not move my...

1097
04:10:01,110 --> 04:10:15,819
I was in position number four. Wait a minute, that's a cheat. Can I... Wait a minute. Hold on,

1098
04:10:15,819 --> 04:10:24,069
preset the whole thing. I can cheat. If I go that way and then come... I can drive over this and

1099
04:10:24,069 --> 04:10:36,409
just... Okay, let's try it. It's not positioning, it's just lap time. Yeah, so who cares? Let's go.

1100
04:10:37,370 --> 04:11:03,510
What if I... Wait, hold on. What if I do this? How smart is the game? Smart. Can't tech that one.

1101
04:11:08,010 --> 04:11:18,809
Yeah, I'm stuck. All right, I'm not... I'm not gonna win that one. Who cares?

1102
04:11:49,209 --> 04:11:53,459
Sorting algorithm. Here it comes.

1103
04:11:53,459 --> 04:12:04,200
Um, how many club remixes of that song do you think exist?

1104
04:12:18,469 --> 04:12:23,739
Too many. I would... I would agree with you. Oh, shit, here we go again.

1105
04:12:29,739 --> 04:12:36,299
Don't worry, I'll get him back. Watch. No, don't come back, because they're on the way out there

1106
04:12:36,299 --> 04:12:40,379
like I'm thinking about clicking the X and then this guy just did fucking three jackpots.

1107
04:12:40,700 --> 04:12:51,799
I didn't do three. Jeremy, you dropped 3,000 subs.

1108
04:12:56,280 --> 04:13:17,420
Whoops. You lost three. Well, I... I gained like 30,000 subs today, right?

1109
04:13:18,620 --> 04:13:31,500
That's... Okay, that's fine. All right, 73,000. 73%. All right, what can I play that won't...

1110
04:13:32,299 --> 04:13:35,500
What if I turn the volume down and we just... And I do that and just win?

1111
04:13:36,139 --> 04:14:04,309
What do you think? Dipman just gave 5,000 bits. Thank you, Dipman. 50 bucks right now. Bang.

1112
04:14:04,870 --> 04:14:13,079
Coming in hot. And Dipman says, I got pulled over for speeding today and the officer let me off

1113
04:14:13,079 --> 04:14:16,920
with a warning because he was in the Christmas spirit. Thought I'd pay it forward. Merry Christmas

1114
04:14:16,920 --> 04:14:24,739
and thanks for five years of laughs. Slow down. First of all, slow down. You're not gonna go that

1115
04:14:24,739 --> 04:14:31,940
fast. Second of all, thanks for the 5,000 bits, the $50. Yeah, it's the spirit of feeling good,

1116
04:14:31,940 --> 04:14:43,959
spirit of giving. You know what I mean? Spirit of giving and receiving because I really hope that

1117
04:14:43,959 --> 04:14:53,979
under the tree come the 25th that I get another couple of mugs for my heated mug set. Just

1118
04:14:54,860 --> 04:15:05,000
throwing it out there for if anybody that might be listening. A duck. I would actually love a duck

1119
04:15:05,000 --> 04:15:08,680
pet. No, but seriously though, Dipman, that's a lot of money. Thank you. That's a huge amount of

1120
04:15:08,680 --> 04:15:21,719
money and just slow down. You're not gonna go that fast. Why do I have all this gas? Why do I have

1121
04:15:21,719 --> 04:15:41,370
10 gas? Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go in the money machine twice and I'm gonna get 25,000

1122
04:15:41,370 --> 04:15:48,500
tickets and then I'm... Look, we'll put on like Yoshi's Story OST or something. Just hang out.

1123
04:15:49,299 --> 04:16:09,159
Go home and bring Harry. You could go for a DeVito Dew right now. I'll get one.

1124
04:16:12,979 --> 04:16:20,469
I'll do the coin pusher game again. I will. I will get my last 500 tickets from the coin pusher.

1125
04:16:21,350 --> 04:16:31,239
Bye, Jerma. I'm gonna go watch Star Wars. Well, as somebody that's force sensitive,

1126
04:16:31,879 --> 04:17:06,280
then I suggest that's cool, you know? What is worst Jedi ever? Let me see. What the

1127
04:17:06,280 --> 04:17:23,639
fuck is going on? I think I should go to the academy.

1128
04:17:33,049 --> 04:18:02,870
This just popped up on my monitor because I closed the tab. Here. Oh, oh, okay. I turn this off.

1129
04:18:02,870 --> 04:18:06,469
Turn this off. I don't want to listen to that anymore. I don't know. Put on fucking Chrono

1130
04:18:06,469 --> 04:18:26,149
Trigger. Put on Trigger OST and just play it. Okay, sounds good. All right, turn this off.

1131
04:18:36,579 --> 04:18:42,549
What? Why is it still going? Why is it doing this?

1132
04:19:04,889 --> 04:19:28,219
Mute. There we go. Now I can't do it without the siren. I can't do it without the siren.

1133
04:19:29,020 --> 04:19:56,569
There's no sense of urgency. 73,000? What do I need? A lot more. Are you doing it with the song?

1134
04:19:57,290 --> 04:20:20,469
Am I? I don't mean to be doing that. Do a text to speech. No, I'm not doing text to speech. What

1135
04:20:20,469 --> 04:20:35,579
am I trying to get with the tickets? I'm trying to get a hoverboard. Damn it. Can you tell me a

1136
04:20:35,579 --> 04:20:48,950
joke? If you do more channel points, maybe you can. Let's see if you guys can figure out my

1137
04:20:48,950 --> 04:20:54,149
favorite song is. What's my favorite song on the entire Chrono Trigger OST? What is it? Anybody

1138
04:20:54,149 --> 04:21:16,540
know? Frog is all right. Frog is okay. It's not Frog. Joke or riot? No, they were going to say

1139
04:21:16,540 --> 04:21:26,739
a joke. They were going to tell a joke. Not me. We're waiting for them to tell the joke. They said,

1140
04:21:26,739 --> 04:21:36,600
do you want to hear a joke? It was in channel points. Please play Chrono Trigger. It's one of

1141
04:21:36,600 --> 04:21:46,940
the best games ever made, so I wouldn't know. It's the epoch theme. Epoch. Epoch. Whatever it is.

1142
04:21:48,360 --> 04:22:02,819
Don't crash. That's the best one. Nah, I picked these up. It's gonna crash. When are you gonna

1143
04:22:02,819 --> 04:22:08,780
do a Chrono Trigger stream? I'd probably treat that the same way I did Mario RPG, which is

1144
04:22:09,819 --> 04:22:16,149
a day that I feel like being nostalgia. I'll beat it. It's another game that I've probably beaten

1145
04:22:16,790 --> 04:22:29,819
at least five to ten times at least. Oh, it's starting to really hang.

1146
04:22:30,860 --> 04:22:41,270
Any good RPG recommendations, chat? I just beat Divinity 2. Chrono Trigger. Yeah, I haven't saved

1147
04:22:41,270 --> 04:22:52,709
the game once all night. Holy shit, this is bad. Excuse me. Knock, knock. Who's there? Who, who,

1148
04:22:52,709 --> 04:23:11,500
who? Who let the owl in? That was pretty good. 83,000. I gotta save the game. Acknowledge me,

1149
04:23:11,500 --> 04:23:24,549
I grinded for these points. Hey, what's up? All right, everyone can breathe.

1150
04:23:35,670 --> 04:23:56,709
Play the epoch theme. It'll show up. You are manually breathing now. That doesn't work,

1151
04:23:56,709 --> 04:24:01,219
it only works in Jump King when I'm aware of every single thing I'm doing.

1152
04:24:05,909 --> 04:24:10,389
Did they add new things to the game? Yes, this area that I'm in right now is a brand new area

1153
04:24:11,190 --> 04:24:18,149
as of a week or two ago. 15 new games, 100,000 tickets for a hoverboard, and you get a house now

1154
04:24:18,149 --> 04:24:35,110
and a duck. Be cool. I don't like this one. This one's sad. Where is it? Where's the epoch? Battle

1155
04:24:35,110 --> 04:24:53,319
theme? Pretty good. Where's the epoch? Come on, where's the epoch? The epoch's the best. Oh,

1156
04:24:53,319 --> 04:25:08,520
that one's good too. What the hell is it? It's got, it's called like the wings of time or something,

1157
04:25:08,520 --> 04:25:53,829
right? Wings across time. There it is. Let's go. This is the best song. This is like Actraiser,

1158
04:25:53,829 --> 04:26:26,579
is it? Dev in chat? Really? No, why do I believe that? Dev ain't here. Hey, it's me. The thing is

1159
04:26:26,579 --> 04:26:30,659
that's like the boy who cried wolf because remember when I played Dusk and everyone was like,

1160
04:26:30,659 --> 04:26:40,139
dude, Dev, Dev in chat. And I'm like, okay. Yeah, whatever. That was real. And then started tweeting.

1161
04:26:40,139 --> 04:26:42,459
Remember like they started tweeting that I was bad at the game and stuff.

1162
04:26:53,610 --> 04:27:03,100
You are bad at the game. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to defend myself here.

1163
04:27:03,100 --> 04:27:09,579
If you play a game like Dusk on these, on the, they arguably the actual hardest difficulty in

1164
04:27:09,579 --> 04:27:16,389
the game and you beat it, what do you want me to do? Close my eyes and do it? Back to the music.

1165
04:27:17,110 --> 04:27:49,379
We're close. Just throwing chairs at us. Eat a ghost pepper. Oh, by the way, I also figured out

1166
04:27:50,260 --> 04:27:54,739
after the fact that the boots was just a joke. You guys, they don't do anything. So yeah,

1167
04:27:55,780 --> 04:27:58,489
I'm glad we had a fight over that for like an hour and a half straight.

1168
04:27:59,450 --> 04:28:13,780
Shit. Okay. Come on. I have to, this has got to be the one. All right. I promise. I won't play

1169
04:28:13,780 --> 04:28:18,100
this one again. I promise. I promise. I won't play this one again. I promise.

1170
04:28:18,979 --> 04:28:37,209
We will finish the rest with games that you guys want me to play. Oh, it's starting to take over.

1171
04:28:38,329 --> 04:28:48,299
Promise me you'll get the boots. Maybe another playthrough years from now. That's three in a

1172
04:28:48,299 --> 04:29:06,520
row. All right. I'm going to, I'm definitely close. I gotta go. I have two more chances.

1173
04:29:07,479 --> 04:29:11,459
All right. That's good. I'm happy now. Last chance. Get it. Sorry. All right.

1174
04:29:12,100 --> 04:29:40,979
I'm not playing this one ever again. All right. It's time. We can get rid of the OST.

1175
04:29:41,780 --> 04:29:45,860
That was just to pass a little bit of time while I got 10, you know, 15,000 points.

1176
04:29:47,059 --> 04:29:56,250
I don't think these sliders do anything. Is he, well, I can end it on dizzy bird.

1177
04:29:56,969 --> 04:30:03,860
Do the coin pusher. We'll do coin pusher. All right. I'm at 92,000. I need

1178
04:30:04,819 --> 04:30:10,889
Jeff's about seven and a half thousand more. Good. I want to try this one again,

1179
04:30:11,530 --> 04:30:18,600
but I need money. I want to try that one again. I thought that was a music playing.

1180
04:30:18,600 --> 04:30:31,879
Am I? I thought I, I thought I auto-played a video that Dev is actually here.

1181
04:30:34,379 --> 04:30:45,479
Dev Oatid is actually Dev. Dev Oatid. What's up? We really like your game. It's great.

1182
04:30:46,440 --> 04:31:05,290
That is awesome. I rarely get to watch anymore. Keep adding cool stuff. You, I know,

1183
04:31:05,290 --> 04:31:12,940
I know you've already got three arcades. That's so, it's too addicting and too much fun.

1184
04:31:13,659 --> 04:31:18,010
You know what I mean? Which, which again, what was the coin pusher game that I didn't do?

1185
04:31:22,069 --> 04:31:32,420
It's good as it is. It's great as it is, but I'm a sicko and I need, I'd want more, more.

1186
04:31:33,379 --> 04:31:43,899
He's demanding more, more, more, more. I'll do laser tag because people didn't get to see it.

1187
04:31:44,540 --> 04:32:03,540
We'll go spawn camp. We need more Arthur. He's going to do one more of these Arthur.

1188
04:32:03,540 --> 04:32:23,370
Just one more. I swear this will be it. Don't you say that game sucked? What are you talking about?

1189
04:32:32,860 --> 04:32:37,530
Wait, I'm sorry. It's, it's hard to follow like what, what, what, like we as gamers

1190
04:32:38,489 --> 04:32:42,649
don't and do not like and do not like. Do we not like Red Dead Redemption 2?

1191
04:32:42,649 --> 04:32:53,739
I wasn't, I didn't get the memo on this one. We do? It was okay. It sucked.

1192
04:32:56,540 --> 04:33:02,389
I gotta get on right. All right. It's time to spawn. Oh, I got three shots now. Give me another one.

1193
04:33:13,720 --> 04:33:19,139
Am I crazy or did the dev just subscribe? That's a good question. Maybe. All right.

1194
04:33:19,299 --> 04:33:24,860
Let me, let me get in here. Let's spawn camp the same person. How'd you guys, why are you up there?

1195
04:33:27,340 --> 04:33:58,389
Stop body blocking. Dick. Can I recharge here? Come with me for a second. Come with me for a

1196
04:33:58,389 --> 04:34:13,189
second. Okay. I have an idea. I'm going to bring him over to the recharge station and just get

1197
04:34:13,669 --> 04:34:25,880
points. Not a thousand tickets. That's a lot. Dev is through crew. Pretty good actually.

1198
04:34:38,709 --> 04:35:21,740
All right, stay here. Damn it. He's running away. No rough housing. Yeah.

1199
04:35:22,700 --> 04:35:41,880
It's got moon means. What's that even supposed to mean? No gravity or something. I don't get it.

1200
04:35:41,880 --> 04:36:20,840
Move, move. Time. Moon aim suck. Mars aim is great. Oh, right. This is stronger. Gravitational pull. I get you.

1201
04:36:27,319 --> 04:36:31,259
Thousand points.

1202
04:36:37,700 --> 04:36:51,740
Game over. 1550. Nice. 16 KD. All right. What am I finishing up with? Coin push. You're right.

1203
04:36:51,740 --> 04:36:55,740
Somebody wanted to do coin push. That sounds fun. We'll do that. We'll do the SpongeBob one.

1204
04:36:57,939 --> 04:37:15,139
Or Bird. Duck. Chicken. Um, Dunko. The mermaid one. Yeah. Mermaid one's good. Let's do mermaid one.

1205
04:37:15,139 --> 04:37:22,020
This one's actually, yeah, this one's fun. This one's brand new, by the way. I think this one

1206
04:37:22,020 --> 04:37:54,069
actually came out like last week. Here we go. This thing's primed and ready. Spam. Yeah, let's spam.

1207
04:37:55,189 --> 04:38:22,950
Wow. All right. Stop burger boy technically. That's not helping. We need some nuance here.

1208
04:38:22,950 --> 04:38:46,759
Here we go. Watch this thing go up. Hey, welcome to Twitch. Enjoy your first, like, three hours.

1209
04:38:47,720 --> 04:38:58,299
Holy shit. That's loud. All right. I gotta turn it down. It is way too loud.

1210
04:38:58,939 --> 04:39:23,669
But didn't I already? I did turn it down. Uh-oh. Is it broken? 800 tickets. Let's go right at the

1211
04:39:23,669 --> 04:39:45,049
middle. Bonus. The death is a sub, but thank you. Welcome. Your game is very charming and fun.

1212
04:39:45,049 --> 04:39:53,639
It's a nice change of pace. It's just, you just can play arcade games. Just hang on.

1213
04:39:54,439 --> 04:40:17,209
Give me another bonus. Let's see how close we are. I thought, what, I didn't leave tickets on the

1214
04:40:17,209 --> 04:40:35,240
ground. We're 394,000 tickets. Dizzy bird, please. I will finish with dizzy bird. I promise. Let's do

1215
04:40:35,240 --> 04:41:08,759
this one. The audio is bugged. That's all good. 360. That's pretty good tickets. Let's do it again.

1216
04:41:09,319 --> 04:41:34,659
Two more times. That's it. If I get to 400, then I win. I feel like I was very accurate that time.

1217
04:41:41,319 --> 04:41:42,759
Not going for doubles. It's hard.

1218
04:42:02,779 --> 04:42:17,750
That's the one. Yes. 400. Oh, I'm very excited about this apparently. Okay. It's almost time.

1219
04:42:20,979 --> 04:42:22,020
It's almost time.

1220
04:42:40,389 --> 04:42:48,200
That was it. Those of you that know, you know. If you know, you know. That just went through

1221
04:42:50,229 --> 04:42:55,189
the credit went through and it instantly wasn't a jackpot. Those of you that know, you know.

1222
04:42:57,020 --> 04:43:01,220
It's hard for me to explain that, but you know. All right. Let's go back to the mermaid.

1223
04:43:01,779 --> 04:43:16,040
This should get us there. Let's go right in the middle.

1224
04:43:16,840 --> 04:43:36,680
No, it's here. Can you play the story mode? Holy shit. That was a lot. No, no.

1225
04:43:45,509 --> 04:43:57,529
The story mode is no, it's not accurate. I want to try it when that comes up.

1226
04:43:58,569 --> 04:44:18,810
This might be the biggest win from this machine up on strength. Oh, they all went flat too.

1227
04:44:18,970 --> 04:44:37,369
You'd love to see that. Easy, easy. Spread it out. There it is flat.

1228
04:44:45,819 --> 04:44:49,880
In 10 seconds, somebody prepare the bottom jewelry. Somebody do it.

1229
04:44:52,310 --> 04:45:25,509
Come on. Oh no. I didn't get a bonus. Come on. Right here.

1230
04:45:33,799 --> 04:45:34,520
More credits.

1231
04:45:43,799 --> 04:45:47,639
1200 tickets. We'll do, uh, one more time and I'm just going to spam in the same corner.

1232
04:45:48,599 --> 04:46:18,330
We'll do half or yeah, 50, 60. It's not going to move at all. Meaty if it falls.

1233
04:46:29,209 --> 04:46:42,549
That was cool. That's not a lot of tickets though. I'm not satisfied with that one

1234
04:46:44,549 --> 04:46:47,349
because look at the left side now. All right, we'll do one more. One more real one

1235
04:46:48,069 --> 04:46:49,990
and I'm going to dizzy. Uh, dizzy bird.

1236
04:47:01,180 --> 04:47:08,139
Disney bird. No, dizzy bird, dizzy bird. Look at that left side. That comes over here.

1237
04:47:17,290 --> 04:47:23,240
How ridiculous that is. I need to get it. Look at this shit. There we go.

1238
04:47:44,889 --> 04:47:53,419
Push it. This last one comes because it really does. We look at all these 10s and 20s and 100s

1239
04:47:58,090 --> 04:48:00,169
and then we'll cash in and go dizzy bird.

1240
04:48:00,169 --> 04:48:36,099
Okay. My cat is addicted to watching me play. It's kind of odd. I wonder why.

1241
04:48:38,900 --> 04:48:51,479
Well, I'm addicted to playing this so I'm not a cat or anything, but it's fun.

1242
04:48:54,500 --> 04:49:06,790
These are the best arcade game in real life. Uh, I'm not sure I agree with that. All right.

1243
04:49:06,790 --> 04:49:09,189
What am I getting completed after the stream is over? First thing I will do.

1244
04:49:09,189 --> 04:49:41,860
I promise. Sushi. Okay. All right. More 20. All right. Make this tactical. Look at that left side.

1245
04:49:43,220 --> 04:50:04,009
Tactical. Ah, that's it. We're out. We're out. So where are these tickets on the ground? Everyone

1246
04:50:04,009 --> 04:50:31,270
says it exists. Where are they? Oh, all right. I wanted to help. Fucker. You got it before I did.

1247
04:50:32,790 --> 04:50:51,849
No. Oh, now it's going to be old news when I get it. Thousand tickets. Hello. I would like

1248
04:50:54,779 --> 04:51:25,619
a hover board, please. What color? Blue. Blue. Thank you. Okay. Bye. How do I ride it? I'm going

1249
04:51:25,619 --> 04:51:54,819
to ride it. Whoa. What the fuck? This thing's fast. I can't ride this. Yes, I can. I can ride

1250
04:51:54,819 --> 04:52:01,930
this. Right. Is it not a vehicle? Is Dev still here? Is this a vehicle? Can I ride this?

1251
04:52:15,750 --> 04:52:24,569
Wow. Don't look over there. Not yet. Oh shit. I can't ride this. It's not rideable. Oh no.

1252
04:52:24,569 --> 04:52:39,270
I can't ride it. Yes, I can. I'm riding it right now. How much does it sell for? I don't know.

1253
04:52:41,430 --> 04:52:45,270
Oh no. I saw a kid riding it. There was a kid riding it in here already.

1254
04:52:46,069 --> 04:53:17,619
He gets the working one. I don't mind it having batteries. Where's my limo? I don't see how much

1255
04:53:17,619 --> 04:53:33,319
it's worth. We have stuff in here. All right. How much is it worth? Uh, that better be 19,000.

1256
04:53:33,319 --> 04:53:54,520
What about this other stuff? What are the, uh, what are the ear pods worth? Get rid of these.

1257
04:53:55,799 --> 04:54:21,939
How much are the ducks? How much are the ice cream ducks without the stick? 52? Nah. I know

1258
04:54:21,939 --> 04:54:30,970
what you're worth. All right. I got all my stuff. Ooh. Cheesy poofs. Push here for cheesy poofs.

1259
04:54:31,770 --> 04:55:05,770
Sure. How much are they? $1.50? You're losing $1 per poof. That's okay. My company is operating

1260
04:55:05,770 --> 04:55:14,919
at a loss. That's normal. My company have buy cheesy poofs and sell to the thing next to me.

1261
04:55:15,560 --> 04:55:24,439
I'll just go get a loan from a bank of $500,000. Pay myself a salary of 50 grand.

1262
04:55:25,319 --> 04:55:33,900
Burn the rest of it. That's what you do, right? I didn't even touch it. I didn't even come close.

1263
04:55:38,389 --> 04:55:45,259
Now I want the lightsaber. Now I want the lightsaber. The hover board doesn't work.

1264
04:55:45,259 --> 04:55:53,939
I want the lightsaber. Go get the lottery tickets. Um, where can you even get the

1265
04:55:53,939 --> 04:55:58,810
lottery tickets? I don't remember. Is it here? No, it's not. Where is it?

1266
04:56:03,290 --> 04:56:08,680
Gas station. There we go. All right. All right. Do I think the lightsaber works? No,

1267
04:56:08,680 --> 04:56:11,000
the lightsaber different doesn't work, but it definitely makes like a

1268
04:56:11,000 --> 04:56:26,630
zoom. Guaranteed. Y'all know that's true. Hey, everybody's saying, dude, what the

1269
04:56:26,630 --> 04:56:34,419
fuck? This is not a Christmas stream. It is now. They're happy. Merry Christmas.

1270
04:56:34,979 --> 04:57:13,740
Are there any new machines in here? I remember this part. I got the ticket back. Whatever.

1271
04:57:15,240 --> 04:57:18,599
No, I'm not going to sit here for an hour or two like I did last time. I promise.

1272
04:57:19,560 --> 04:57:25,259
I just want to see what it was all about. I just want to see what it was all about.

1273
04:57:25,979 --> 04:58:10,950
One more fish. Come on, fish. Spoiled brat.

1274
04:58:13,029 --> 04:58:16,299
All right. I'm going to end it with dizzy bird and then I'm going to play

1275
04:58:16,299 --> 04:58:33,299
elf bowling for like 10 minutes. Let's go dizzy bird time. Get the fireworks.

1276
04:58:34,020 --> 04:58:45,930
Yeah, I did the fireworks last time. No, you can't do this twice. I know it's my birthday.

1277
04:58:45,930 --> 04:58:53,529
Happy birthday. Really? I knew the surprise was coming. Unbelievable. I can't believe you guys.

1278
04:58:54,250 --> 04:59:23,619
Why wouldn't you surprise me? I'm going to do this until I have no more money.

1279
04:59:23,619 --> 04:59:32,389
What is it? Two bucks? All right. No, I'm going to do it 10 times. That was one.

1280
04:59:32,389 --> 04:59:44,619
That was not even close. How did I get a penny? Yeah, where did a penny come from?

1281
04:59:45,419 --> 04:59:57,029
That seems out of place. That's too far. That's too hard to gauge.

1282
05:00:02,099 --> 05:00:06,540
That's too far to gauge. You need the one that's close. It's in the same spot. Great.

1283
05:00:06,540 --> 05:00:30,459
At least I get a bonus. Right there. Right there. How many was that? Four?

1284
05:00:30,459 --> 05:00:54,119
This is the one. This is the best one to do. It wasn't even close. Not even close.

1285
05:00:56,419 --> 05:01:04,259
Not even close. That's okay. I've already beaten it. All right. Three more. This is

1286
05:01:04,259 --> 05:01:11,610
memory. I'm serious. I'm only doing this 10 times. What the fuck do I keep messing up?

1287
05:01:14,810 --> 05:01:35,860
It's all right. Two more. Last one. Incoming. Where's the light?

1288
05:01:50,569 --> 05:01:59,990
Are you fucking kidding me? I almost got it. There it is. The final one.

1289
05:01:59,990 --> 05:02:15,240
I'm leaving without you. I'm leaving without you. What is going on with you?

1290
05:02:18,729 --> 05:02:23,450
All right. That's it. That's Dizzy Bird. That's the end. Now we're going to move on.

1291
05:02:24,409 --> 05:02:28,869
We're going to drink a Mountain Dew. And that is it for the game.

1292
05:02:31,209 --> 05:02:40,220
Until the next update. Whenever that happens. Now we're going to do elf bowling. Where's the trash?

1293
05:02:44,619 --> 05:02:55,880
There is no trash. That was good. That's a pretty substantial update.

1294
05:02:56,360 --> 05:03:04,330
You got a whole new arcade. You got a house with a duck in it and everything. That's pretty cool.

1295
05:03:07,400 --> 05:03:30,860
Yeah. I'm going to transition to elf bowling. I have to end the stream the same way I ended

1296
05:03:30,860 --> 05:03:54,279
the last one. Hey, somebody just fucking hit me. I was just told somebody was Bowser.

1297
05:03:55,000 --> 05:04:15,319
I'll take one. I'll take two. All right. We got two of these. Where are they? Here.

1298
05:04:15,959 --> 05:04:48,819
Okay. Well, pick it up. Watch out. Put it in the golf cart and drive around. I don't think it'll

1299
05:04:48,819 --> 05:05:03,369
stay. I'll try. Damn it. I kind of want to do like 20 of these in the golf cart. Can I do that?

1300
05:05:09,209 --> 05:05:14,020
No way. Not one will barely fit in here. Is it facing the right way?

1301
05:05:24,979 --> 05:05:43,259
Drive. Drive. I drove the cart into the water last time too. Yeah. That's what I have to do.

1302
05:05:44,220 --> 05:05:47,259
There's a fail. Well, I can't drive over this for some reason.

1303
05:05:53,590 --> 05:06:47,529
Come on. Why can I not drive over this? Is it patched? Yeah, we're good. I'm still going.

1304
05:06:48,569 --> 05:07:14,389
Still going. Still going. Still going. Still going. Go. Keep going. Keep going. Go. More. More.

1305
05:07:25,060 --> 05:08:00,360
I'm not pressing any buttons. There it is. The end of the world. Oh, I didn't save the game.

1306
05:08:11,509 --> 05:08:16,680
Remind me that if I play this game again, I don't have any more gas and I need to walk back to...

1307
05:08:17,479 --> 05:08:23,380
Can you die? No, I can teleport. I can teleport. All right. Elf Balling time to end the stream.

1308
05:08:23,380 --> 05:08:28,419
Merry Christmas, everybody. If you've taken off, we'll see when I get back. I'm going to be taking

1309
05:08:28,419 --> 05:08:35,340
a few days off for the holiday. Please continue to nominate and discuss the end of the year stuff

1310
05:08:35,340 --> 05:08:45,139
that's not turning off. I will see you guys on Friday the 27th. If you celebrate Christmas,

1311
05:08:46,099 --> 05:08:52,250
happy Christmas, happy holidays. Whatever you happen to be celebrating, happy holidays to you.

1312
05:08:53,369 --> 05:09:07,049
I'll be back on Friday. And now let's do Elf Bowling. And if you were curious, yes,

1313
05:09:07,610 --> 05:09:56,950
it's already here ready to go. It is. I didn't know they were naked. How do you play? Oh, like

1314
05:09:56,950 --> 05:10:11,340
that. X. This is the first game I ever played. Is it really? I feel like it's at times 10 speed.

1315
05:10:13,590 --> 05:10:28,380
Why is it sounds so fast? Strike. Let me get to in a row. There it is.

1316
05:10:32,380 --> 05:10:39,099
It's my processor is going too fast. Did it just, did it just cut off somebody's head?

1317
05:10:40,060 --> 05:10:46,900
I don't remember doing that. It just ripped his head off.

1318
05:10:53,419 --> 05:10:58,979
God, that was three strikes in a row. Elf Bowling Dev in chat.

1319
05:11:00,979 --> 05:11:06,020
No way, because I don't think this game came out like 30 years ago.

1320
05:11:09,750 --> 05:11:13,380
Sorry, something came on the screen. I had to try to throw something. I don't know why.

1321
05:11:13,380 --> 05:11:27,720
How old is this game? I don't know. When did the internet come out? 1997? 1996?

1322
05:11:30,919 --> 05:11:34,200
I think I could probably get at least four or five strikes in a row if I try hard.

1323
05:11:37,830 --> 05:11:48,939
I gotta use my right hand. That's a spare.

1324
05:11:52,139 --> 05:11:54,299
You thought the game broke when the elf's head came off.

1325
05:11:56,759 --> 05:12:00,919
This game was completely showered in controversy, if you don't know.

1326
05:12:01,959 --> 05:12:05,560
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the original version of this game was a virus.

1327
05:12:08,490 --> 05:12:14,180
Right? It was, wasn't it? The original version of this game was a virus.

1328
05:12:20,090 --> 05:12:28,580
Hold on. I need to confirm. Can somebody look it up?

1329
05:12:33,450 --> 05:12:34,250
It's definitely sped up.

1330
05:12:38,470 --> 05:12:42,790
Let's do quit. Elf Bowling, let's do Elf Bowling 2.

1331
05:12:49,060 --> 05:12:50,500
Elves in Paradise.

1332
05:12:55,979 --> 05:13:00,459
Okay, I need to be clear. This doesn't show his elf dick, right? Tell me that's not true.

1333
05:13:02,790 --> 05:13:05,189
I don't want to get an elf dick. Okay, there's probably an elf dick in this.

1334
05:13:12,680 --> 05:13:24,619
It's shuffleboard. Don't pull your fucking underwear down.

1335
05:13:24,619 --> 05:13:43,400
All right, I'm out of here. Don't pull your fucking elf underwear down, don't you fucking dare.

1336
05:13:43,400 --> 05:13:49,830
Don't. I gotta go right up this way.

1337
05:13:50,630 --> 05:13:57,419
It wasn't a virus, by the way. It wasn't?

1338
05:14:04,459 --> 05:14:09,369
There's an elf dick. Play something else. I don't think there is.

1339
05:14:16,389 --> 05:14:20,580
300. They made a movie based on this?

1340
05:14:21,380 --> 05:14:33,380
If you have received elf bowling or frogapult games on the internet.

1341
05:14:33,380 --> 05:14:34,740
Spam that again. I can't. I didn't see it.

1342
05:14:42,520 --> 05:14:48,060
It's awful. If you've received elf bowling or frogapult games that have been circling the

1343
05:14:48,060 --> 05:14:52,139
internet and no one has, they must be deleted before Christmas Day. They contain viruses that

1344
05:14:52,139 --> 05:14:55,900
is to go off on Christmas Day and will delete your hard drive. That wasn't real?

1345
05:14:56,779 --> 05:15:09,299
It was a hoax. I don't know.

1346
05:15:10,419 --> 05:15:15,080
How am I supposed to know? I was probably like 12 years old.

1347
05:15:18,819 --> 05:15:21,380
It still is. You have less than 24 hours to delete this.

1348
05:15:22,869 --> 05:15:26,020
I don't want to play this anymore. I'm done.

1349
05:15:26,020 --> 05:15:42,819
How is this elf bowling 2? Elf bowling movie IMDB link.

1350
05:15:43,619 --> 05:15:46,009
Is there a trailer for the movie? I can watch that, right?

1351
05:15:46,009 --> 05:15:48,250
That's not like against the rules. I want to watch the trailer.

1352
05:15:49,049 --> 05:15:52,680
Yeah, let's watch the trailer for elf bowling the movie.

1353
05:16:04,470 --> 05:16:07,770
You're dead. This is the last round.

1354
05:16:07,770 --> 05:16:24,500
All right. I'm done. Forget about polar bowler.

1355
05:16:28,819 --> 05:16:32,790
All right. That was fun. You thought I was going to do that for less than 10 minutes?

1356
05:16:35,209 --> 05:16:37,529
More than 10 minutes? No way. Not a million years.

1357
05:16:39,380 --> 05:16:47,619
I want to watch the elf bowling movie trailer. Elf bowling the movie.

1358
05:16:52,680 --> 05:17:05,259
All right. Let's watch it. Please rate your ad experience.

1359
05:17:05,259 --> 05:17:08,900
Oh, shut up. Yeah. I hate it.

1360
05:17:10,009 --> 05:17:12,889
All right. Elf bowling trailer. 10 years ago?

1361
05:17:16,840 --> 05:17:22,459
This trailer is in like a terrible 480p trailer. This is okay.

1362
05:17:23,340 --> 05:17:32,599
Let's go. Yeah. Okay. Ready?

1363
05:17:44,840 --> 05:17:48,200
Put all them creature stolen toys in me cabin.

1364
05:17:48,200 --> 05:17:52,680
First of all, I just got to say an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

1365
05:17:53,400 --> 05:17:56,439
has which is about the same amount of animation quality.

1366
05:17:59,029 --> 05:18:04,630
Could it be that a long, long time ago, Santa started out as a pirate

1367
05:18:04,630 --> 05:18:08,389
and wound up kicked off his own ship? It's him.

1368
05:18:08,389 --> 05:18:12,069
And what do you lads do in this wondrous place?

1369
05:18:12,069 --> 05:18:19,349
See for yourself. It's a magical and mystical marvelous world.

1370
05:18:20,310 --> 05:18:23,590
It doesn't even fit up. It doesn't even fit up.

1371
05:18:29,750 --> 05:18:32,549
You're going to call me the Madagascar Penguins?

1372
05:18:38,549 --> 05:18:42,549
Are we sure this is not an iPad ad for an iPad game?

1373
05:18:49,349 --> 05:18:52,790
The Elf Bowling, the movie.

1374
05:18:53,830 --> 05:18:58,549
This is like a chick flick, except instead of smoking babes, dude,

1375
05:18:59,189 --> 05:19:01,029
it's a bunch getting a fat guy.

1376
05:19:05,400 --> 05:19:08,279
Is this movie in public domain? Can we watch this movie on stream?

1377
05:19:08,279 --> 05:19:17,659
I would. Wait, what? There's a second movie? No, there's not.

1378
05:19:27,659 --> 05:19:35,750
No, no, that's not real. Is it in public domain?

1379
05:19:37,799 --> 05:19:46,869
No way. Who owns the rights to Elf Bowling, the movie?

1380
05:19:50,950 --> 05:19:53,750
The Wikipedia article for it has been marked for deletion.

1381
05:19:59,819 --> 05:20:01,500
That's the nail in the coffin right there.

1382
05:20:03,080 --> 05:20:07,959
That's so funny. Well, we have to watch it before it gets deleted from the world.

1383
05:20:09,459 --> 05:20:13,099
If it's not on Wikipedia, then it doesn't exist.

1384
05:20:14,490 --> 05:20:16,250
Buy the rights to the Elf Bowling movie.

1385
05:20:16,250 --> 05:20:17,849
It's probably way more expensive than you think.

1386
05:20:19,939 --> 05:20:24,500
I would not be surprised if the rights to Elf Bowling and Elf Bowling, the movie,

1387
05:20:24,500 --> 05:20:30,900
all Elf Bowling intellectual property is less than two to three hundred thousand dollars.

1388
05:20:31,540 --> 05:20:33,860
It's probably like five hundred thousand dollars.

1389
05:20:41,139 --> 05:20:45,990
Imagine doing a Kickstarter for like a million dollars.

1390
05:20:47,130 --> 05:20:50,490
And the goal of Kickstarter is for me to get enough money to

1391
05:20:50,490 --> 05:20:56,740
buy out and own the IP of Elf Bowling. But what would I do?

1392
05:21:01,689 --> 05:21:04,090
It was six and a half million dollars to make that movie.

1393
05:21:04,090 --> 05:21:06,650
There's no way I could afford to buy Elf Bowling's IP.

1394
05:21:08,459 --> 05:21:11,500
To watch it on stream. To watch the movie on stream.

1395
05:21:15,020 --> 05:21:17,180
Buy it to put it in the public domain.

1396
05:21:27,380 --> 05:21:27,700
God.

1397
05:21:29,959 --> 05:21:33,270
Anyways, that's going to wrap up the stream.

1398
05:21:33,909 --> 05:21:36,540
I'm going to get some food. That was a lot of fun.

1399
05:21:41,209 --> 05:21:43,049
Hopefully you guys have a good Christmas.

1400
05:21:43,610 --> 05:21:48,759
I'll see you guys on Friday.

1401
05:21:49,720 --> 05:21:52,599
For... I don't know.

1402
05:21:53,560 --> 05:21:54,119
I don't know.

1403
05:21:58,650 --> 05:21:59,930
What the hell? What the hell?

1404
05:22:00,729 --> 05:22:01,450
Nancy Drew?

1405
05:22:07,900 --> 05:22:08,400
No.

1406
05:22:10,819 --> 05:22:16,330
No, no, no, no.

1407
05:22:19,139 --> 05:22:20,259
Yes. No.

1408
05:22:20,259 --> 05:22:20,819
May we'll see.

1409
05:22:21,540 --> 05:22:24,180
We'll see if it depends on how good my Christmas was.

1410
05:22:24,180 --> 05:22:26,099
If I had a really great Christmas,

1411
05:22:26,099 --> 05:22:28,580
then maybe we'll do Nancy Drew post Christmas stream.

1412
05:22:30,340 --> 05:22:32,979
If I had, if I didn't like my, if I didn't have fun on Christmas,

1413
05:22:33,939 --> 05:22:35,380
then we'll do The Surge 2.

1414
05:22:36,259 --> 05:22:40,490
I got to stop saying I'm going to play The Surge 2 because

1415
05:22:42,869 --> 05:22:44,389
I don't want to do that.

1416
05:22:49,299 --> 05:22:49,799
Anywho.

1417
05:22:50,979 --> 05:22:52,580
Let's do the bits and the subs and everything.

1418
05:22:53,220 --> 05:22:54,580
What about Disco Elsium?

1419
05:22:54,580 --> 05:22:56,020
Ah, that's another thing I was thinking of.

1420
05:22:58,709 --> 05:22:59,209
We'll see.

1421
05:23:00,340 --> 05:23:00,840
We'll see.

1422
05:23:01,380 --> 05:23:04,340
See you guys on Friday.

1423
05:23:04,900 --> 05:23:06,439
Have a great holiday.

1424
05:23:08,180 --> 05:23:10,340
If you haven't yet, I want to make sure I keep reiterating this.

1425
05:23:11,659 --> 05:23:15,659
Go to the Discord and check out the nominations channel for the New Year's Eve stream.

1426
05:23:16,380 --> 05:23:17,259
Nominate something.

1427
05:23:17,259 --> 05:23:19,740
If you see one of those categories, go to the discussion channel.

1428
05:23:19,740 --> 05:23:21,180
There's a pinned message.

1429
05:23:21,180 --> 05:23:21,979
Discuss it.

1430
05:23:21,979 --> 05:23:22,860
Nominate.

1431
05:23:22,860 --> 05:23:23,740
Nominate stuff.

1432
05:23:24,380 --> 05:23:24,939
If you want.

1433
05:23:25,819 --> 05:23:26,939
It is currently available.

1434
05:23:26,939 --> 05:23:30,540
It is going to stop the day that I come back.

1435
05:23:34,069 --> 05:23:35,430
Friday the 27th.

1436
05:23:37,159 --> 05:23:40,279
As of probably, I don't know, Friday night.

1437
05:23:40,279 --> 05:23:42,119
As of the stream turning off on Friday.

1438
05:23:44,119 --> 05:23:45,479
That's it for nominations.

1439
05:23:46,040 --> 05:23:50,409
And then the voting is going to start the next day.

1440
05:23:50,409 --> 05:23:52,330
Literally the next day for three days.

1441
05:23:53,209 --> 05:23:56,020
You will have three full days to cast your vote.

1442
05:23:56,020 --> 05:23:58,740
And then, obviously, on the 31st, we have to go over them.

1443
05:24:01,900 --> 05:24:04,779
I'll be talking about it every single stream leading up to the 31st.

1444
05:24:05,580 --> 05:24:08,840
The day I come back is the last day that you can nominate something.

1445
05:24:09,479 --> 05:24:12,340
Check it out.

1446
05:24:12,340 --> 05:24:17,580
Let's do the bits.

1447
05:24:21,990 --> 05:24:22,470
Be good.

1448
05:24:22,470 --> 05:24:26,439
Yeah, I hope Santa is good to you guys this year.

1449
05:24:29,319 --> 05:24:32,599
Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.

1450
05:24:34,090 --> 05:24:34,889
We had Dark Soul.

1451
05:24:34,889 --> 05:24:36,090
Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.

1452
05:24:37,479 --> 05:24:39,959
I'm here from Gap Gaming with your first paycheck.

1453
05:24:40,919 --> 05:24:42,680
We're really looking forward to sponsoring more streams,

1454
05:24:42,680 --> 05:24:46,599
but keep in mind these bits confirm your agreement to our exclusivity deal.

1455
05:24:46,599 --> 05:24:48,680
You can only wear Gap brand clothes on stream,

1456
05:24:48,680 --> 05:24:51,080
and you must now refer to your viewers as Gappers.

1457
05:24:51,639 --> 05:24:53,159
Thanks, and have a great stream.

1458
05:24:53,159 --> 05:24:54,759
Imagine doing that for $2.50.

1459
05:24:57,779 --> 05:25:00,580
Add four zeros, and maybe I'll think about it.

1460
05:25:00,580 --> 05:25:05,380
25, 250, 2500, 125,000, 250.

1461
05:25:05,380 --> 05:25:06,740
All right, that's $2.5 million.

1462
05:25:07,779 --> 05:25:09,299
I thought it was a little bit less than that.

1463
05:25:09,299 --> 05:25:09,939
All right, never mind.

1464
05:25:11,419 --> 05:25:13,020
Hey, Dark Soul, thanks for the 250.

1465
05:25:13,020 --> 05:25:14,459
Hi, I'm here from Gap Gaming.

1466
05:25:14,459 --> 05:25:15,500
Wait, what?

1467
05:25:15,500 --> 05:25:16,459
Why is it happening twice?

1468
05:25:18,729 --> 05:25:23,049
It's not, it's the same one, but I don't know why it doesn't make any sense.

1469
05:25:24,709 --> 05:25:26,389
Hey, it's me from Gap Gaming again.

1470
05:25:26,389 --> 05:25:29,669
Hey, a triple, triple zero Neo, thanks for the 250.

1471
05:25:30,389 --> 05:25:31,830
Chicken Game or Riot, I did.

1472
05:25:32,549 --> 05:25:33,669
Played it a few times, actually.

1473
05:25:34,389 --> 05:25:38,229
What about Community Night?

1474
05:25:38,950 --> 05:25:40,470
Yeah, Community Night got screwed up,

1475
05:25:40,470 --> 05:25:42,869
because I was supposed to go in front of the green screen

1476
05:25:42,869 --> 05:25:45,270
before the third one happened,

1477
05:25:45,909 --> 05:25:49,189
and I ended up having to push the green screen until further notice,

1478
05:25:49,189 --> 05:25:51,110
until I start to go to the physical therapy,

1479
05:25:51,110 --> 05:25:54,389
and it got a little botched.

1480
05:25:54,389 --> 05:25:57,830
So that's still going to have to sit on the burner for another couple weeks, probably.

1481
05:25:58,790 --> 05:26:00,950
But I'm no longer going to wait.

1482
05:26:01,750 --> 05:26:07,430
I'm not going to wait anymore to do Community Content Night 3.

1483
05:26:09,659 --> 05:26:12,459
So it'll probably happen at some point in the middle of January,

1484
05:26:12,459 --> 05:26:14,060
first or second week of January.

1485
05:26:14,060 --> 05:26:17,549
That's that.

1486
05:26:18,270 --> 05:26:19,310
But thank you, triple zero.

1487
05:26:20,110 --> 05:26:21,319
We did play the Chicken Game.

1488
05:26:22,200 --> 05:26:24,200
Martin had a meme, thanks for the 2,000 bits.

1489
05:26:24,200 --> 05:26:25,560
$20 from Martin had a meme.

1490
05:26:26,360 --> 05:26:28,330
Thanks for the 2,000 bits.

1491
05:26:29,049 --> 05:26:32,040
This was the game where you had your scratch ticket stream idea,

1492
05:26:32,040 --> 05:26:34,680
and I'd like to one-up that by saying you should buy a bunch of scratch

1493
05:26:34,680 --> 05:26:36,360
and sniff cards and smell them on stream.

1494
05:26:38,360 --> 05:26:40,700
Well, the scratch card thing got fucked up,

1495
05:26:40,700 --> 05:26:44,139
because I didn't know that Nevada doesn't have a state lottery.

1496
05:26:45,020 --> 05:26:47,580
So I'm like, we're going to scratch $200

1497
05:26:48,060 --> 05:26:52,000
worth of scratch tickets for every death in Sekiro.

1498
05:26:52,000 --> 05:26:55,360
And it's like, oh, sorry, turns out there are no scratch tickets in Nevada.

1499
05:26:55,360 --> 05:26:56,000
They don't exist.

1500
05:26:56,000 --> 05:26:57,200
There's no such thing.

1501
05:26:57,200 --> 05:26:59,709
There's no state lottery in Nevada.

1502
05:26:59,709 --> 05:27:02,509
And I was like, all right, well, maybe I'll have somebody send me

1503
05:27:03,229 --> 05:27:08,040
buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and send them to me from like Massachusetts.

1504
05:27:08,599 --> 05:27:09,799
Nobody wants to fucking do that.

1505
05:27:10,360 --> 05:27:16,240
Hey, can you buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and mail them to me and I'll pay you?

1506
05:27:16,240 --> 05:27:18,119
It's like, leave me alone, Jeremy.

1507
05:27:18,840 --> 05:27:22,349
Go to California, fly to California.

1508
05:27:27,080 --> 05:27:28,360
That's a lie stream.

1509
05:27:28,919 --> 05:27:30,119
No, that's not fair.

1510
05:27:30,119 --> 05:27:31,080
That's not a lie.

1511
05:27:31,080 --> 05:27:32,520
I can't, I couldn't do it.

1512
05:27:34,349 --> 05:27:36,669
I don't know that Nevada, I've only been here for a year.

1513
05:27:36,669 --> 05:27:38,110
I didn't know that I couldn't do that.

1514
05:27:40,799 --> 05:27:41,919
It's not a lie.

1515
05:27:41,919 --> 05:27:44,880
If you attempt to do something and you get legally, you can't.

1516
05:27:48,279 --> 05:27:49,159
Okay, sure.

1517
05:27:49,159 --> 05:27:50,200
Sorry, I didn't.

1518
05:27:50,200 --> 05:28:00,060
Sorry, I didn't get on an airplane to go to California to buy scratch tickets.

1519
05:28:00,060 --> 05:28:01,740
Isn't California right across the border?

1520
05:28:02,299 --> 05:28:04,619
Um, yeah, it's like a four hour drive.

1521
05:28:07,450 --> 05:28:11,290
That's, that's an eight plus hour trip to go get scratch tickets.

1522
05:28:17,560 --> 05:28:18,599
That's not long.

1523
05:28:19,240 --> 05:28:21,159
That's a long ass time in a car.

1524
05:28:26,110 --> 05:28:27,790
And it's not even, that's not just eight hours.

1525
05:28:28,430 --> 05:28:30,750
That's four hours plus to get there.

1526
05:28:31,310 --> 05:28:33,869
That's without traffic in California.

1527
05:28:34,430 --> 05:28:40,270
Once I get into California, I'm, what am I just going to drive to the border?

1528
05:28:40,909 --> 05:28:46,509
Take a step over the border and find the first gas station and buy $300 worth of scratch tickets.

1529
05:28:46,509 --> 05:28:49,310
The first gas, they're going to call the police on me.

1530
05:28:54,169 --> 05:28:57,290
Wouldn't that turn around and drive back over the, that's,

1531
05:29:02,060 --> 05:29:04,380
is it weird that I'm scared to do that?

1532
05:29:04,380 --> 05:29:07,419
Imagine if I got pulled over, like going over the border to Nevada.

1533
05:29:08,520 --> 05:29:10,599
Sir, I see that you just pulled into a gas station.

1534
05:29:11,159 --> 05:29:12,200
Yeah, I did.

1535
05:29:12,200 --> 05:29:13,639
Can I take a look inside your car here?

1536
05:29:14,599 --> 05:29:15,319
Uh, yeah.

1537
05:29:15,319 --> 05:29:16,680
What are these scratch tickets doing here?

1538
05:29:16,919 --> 05:29:18,279
I know it's not illegal.

1539
05:29:26,000 --> 05:29:29,279
It's not illegal to scratch scratch tickets in another state.

1540
05:29:29,279 --> 05:29:30,959
I'm just, it's not illegal.

1541
05:29:32,880 --> 05:29:35,360
Look, I'm going to, let's, let's be, no, I did.

1542
05:29:35,360 --> 05:29:41,150
I did not drive three, four, five hours across the border to get scratch tickets.

1543
05:29:42,509 --> 05:29:43,389
I'm sorry.

1544
05:29:43,389 --> 05:29:44,349
I didn't do that.

1545
05:29:50,619 --> 05:29:51,099
How about this?

1546
05:29:51,099 --> 05:29:52,939
The next time, it's going to be a lie.

1547
05:29:53,659 --> 05:29:55,919
The next time I'm in California, this is a lie.

1548
05:29:55,919 --> 05:29:57,040
Why would I even say this?

1549
05:29:57,040 --> 05:30:02,400
The next, the next time I'm in California, which I go a few times a year, stuff like E3,

1550
05:30:03,279 --> 05:30:07,360
Twitch con, you know, the next time I'm in, I'm in California, I'm going to buy

1551
05:30:07,360 --> 05:30:09,680
300 fucking dollars worth scratch tickets.

1552
05:30:09,680 --> 05:30:11,759
And, but then I'm going to get searched at TSA.

1553
05:30:11,759 --> 05:30:12,959
They're going to be like, what's this guy doing?

1554
05:30:13,919 --> 05:30:18,400
Why is, is, is this guy so addicted to gambling that he goes to a,

1555
05:30:18,400 --> 05:30:25,639
on a trip to Los Angeles and buys a like 50 scratch tickets and it's in his bag.

1556
05:30:25,639 --> 05:30:30,360
He's going, where's, what's his, what's, where's his ticket to Las Vegas?

1557
05:30:31,759 --> 05:30:36,479
This dude's going back to Las Vegas with like 75 scratch tickets.

1558
05:30:36,479 --> 05:30:39,529
I'm going to get searched.

1559
05:30:39,529 --> 05:30:48,189
I'm going to be like, okay, what are you doing here?

1560
05:30:48,189 --> 05:30:53,450
Guys, you know, if you walk off the airplane in the Las Vegas airport,

1561
05:30:53,450 --> 05:30:55,610
there's a slot machine right when you get out of the terminal,

1562
05:30:55,610 --> 05:30:56,729
they're going to be like, what are you doing?

1563
05:30:58,220 --> 05:30:59,180
Mail them to yourself.

1564
05:31:13,360 --> 05:31:15,040
Yes, I'd like to send a package please.

1565
05:31:15,040 --> 05:31:15,599
Oh, okay.

1566
05:31:15,599 --> 05:31:18,959
I welcome to welcome to like the UPS store.

1567
05:31:18,959 --> 05:31:20,319
Welcome to the USPS office.

1568
05:31:20,319 --> 05:31:21,680
Welcome to FedEx store.

1569
05:31:21,680 --> 05:31:22,479
How can I help you?

1570
05:31:23,200 --> 05:31:25,759
Yeah, I'd like to mail a hundred scratch tickets to myself.

1571
05:31:26,639 --> 05:31:28,720
Oh, you're insane.

1572
05:31:28,720 --> 05:31:29,200
Sure thing.

1573
05:31:29,200 --> 05:31:29,919
It's your money.

1574
05:31:39,229 --> 05:31:39,950
Where do you live?

1575
05:31:40,669 --> 05:31:41,470
Las Vegas.

1576
05:31:42,029 --> 05:31:42,430
Okay.

1577
05:31:52,439 --> 05:31:53,400
Just buy the stamp.

1578
05:31:53,400 --> 05:31:54,759
You don't have to tell him what you're sending.

1579
05:31:54,759 --> 05:31:56,200
Yeah, but I'm fucking crazy.

1580
05:31:57,159 --> 05:31:58,360
I know it's in that box.

1581
05:31:58,360 --> 05:32:00,360
And I'm going to be like, there's scratch tickets in there.

1582
05:32:00,360 --> 05:32:02,680
Like, I don't know.

1583
05:32:02,680 --> 05:32:03,400
I'm a weirdo.

1584
05:32:04,200 --> 05:32:05,689
Oh, yeah.

1585
05:32:05,689 --> 05:32:05,849
Here.

1586
05:32:05,849 --> 05:32:07,130
I'm just sending out a package.

1587
05:32:07,930 --> 05:32:08,250
Okay.

1588
05:32:08,250 --> 05:32:08,889
Yeah.

1589
05:32:08,889 --> 05:32:09,369
Thank you.

1590
05:32:09,369 --> 05:32:09,849
That's it.

1591
05:32:09,849 --> 05:32:11,369
That's all our conversation has to be.

1592
05:32:11,369 --> 05:32:12,729
Yes, scratch tickets in there.

1593
05:32:12,729 --> 05:32:13,930
What the heck?

1594
05:32:13,930 --> 05:32:14,970
What am I doing?

1595
05:32:16,200 --> 05:32:16,840
Okay.

1596
05:32:16,840 --> 05:32:17,240
Yes.

1597
05:32:17,240 --> 05:32:17,880
Have a good day.

1598
05:32:33,200 --> 05:32:34,880
You're an oblivion NPC.

1599
05:32:40,990 --> 05:32:48,889
I just have to say everything I'm doing and walk in there.

1600
05:32:49,770 --> 05:32:51,209
Well, cool door.

1601
05:32:51,209 --> 05:32:52,009
Interesting door.

1602
05:32:52,970 --> 05:32:53,450
Howdy.

1603
05:32:53,450 --> 05:32:54,009
How are you?

1604
05:32:54,650 --> 05:32:54,970
Hi.

1605
05:32:56,060 --> 05:32:56,459
Wow.

1606
05:32:57,099 --> 05:32:58,540
Scratch tickets in this box.

1607
05:32:59,819 --> 05:33:00,299
How much?

1608
05:33:01,020 --> 05:33:01,500
Howdy.

1609
05:33:02,220 --> 05:33:02,860
How are you?

1610
05:33:10,409 --> 05:33:11,610
You're a math problem.

1611
05:33:19,200 --> 05:33:20,560
That's not an oblivion NPC.

1612
05:33:20,560 --> 05:33:22,400
That's a shitty, that's a bad let's player.

1613
05:33:29,759 --> 05:33:31,759
Yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty good.

1614
05:33:31,759 --> 05:33:32,560
That's pretty good.

1615
05:33:32,560 --> 05:33:36,759
Anyways, scratch and sniff cards.

1616
05:33:36,759 --> 05:33:37,880
But you can't smell them.

1617
05:33:37,880 --> 05:33:39,159
How could, why would that work?

1618
05:34:00,540 --> 05:34:01,180
I can't.

1619
05:34:02,139 --> 05:34:08,240
All right.

1620
05:34:09,279 --> 05:34:09,759
All right.

1621
05:34:10,479 --> 05:34:12,000
I'm gonna, let's go.

1622
05:34:12,720 --> 05:34:14,590
Let's go.

1623
05:34:15,150 --> 05:34:15,869
Let's go.

1624
05:34:15,869 --> 05:34:16,590
Let's go.

1625
05:34:16,590 --> 05:34:17,869
We got, we got.

1626
05:34:19,310 --> 05:34:20,029
Let's go.

1627
05:34:20,029 --> 05:34:20,590
Let's go.

1628
05:34:20,590 --> 05:34:20,990
Let's go.

1629
05:34:20,990 --> 05:34:22,990
It's four hours to Los Angeles.

1630
05:34:22,990 --> 05:34:23,310
All right.

1631
05:34:24,110 --> 05:34:25,950
It's like a five hour drive.

1632
05:34:25,950 --> 05:34:26,349
All right.

1633
05:34:34,189 --> 05:34:37,310
How dare you prove me wrong and embarrass me on my own stream?

1634
05:34:38,029 --> 05:34:38,830
How dare you?

1635
05:34:48,720 --> 05:34:50,240
Road trip stream.

1636
05:34:59,389 --> 05:35:01,310
No, I'm not doing a driving stream.

1637
05:35:01,310 --> 05:35:02,029
Are you crazy?

1638
05:35:15,049 --> 05:35:15,849
Desert bus.

1639
05:35:19,200 --> 05:35:19,520
Don't.

1640
05:35:19,520 --> 05:35:21,599
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna do a driving.

1641
05:35:21,599 --> 05:35:25,439
If I go, if I go anywhere, it's not gonna be on stream.

1642
05:35:26,319 --> 05:35:34,279
All right.

1643
05:35:34,279 --> 05:35:34,680
We gotta move.

1644
05:35:34,680 --> 05:35:35,080
We gotta go.

1645
05:35:35,080 --> 05:35:35,400
We gotta go.

1646
05:35:35,400 --> 05:35:35,799
We gotta go.

1647
05:35:35,799 --> 05:35:36,119
We gotta go.

1648
05:35:36,119 --> 05:35:36,439
We gotta go.

1649
05:35:36,439 --> 05:35:36,840
We gotta go.

1650
05:35:36,840 --> 05:35:38,520
We gotta move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move.

1651
05:35:38,520 --> 05:35:39,080
It's Christmas.

1652
05:35:39,080 --> 05:35:39,319
Come on.

1653
05:35:39,319 --> 05:35:40,279
People got places to go.

1654
05:35:41,240 --> 05:35:43,369
Where were we?

1655
05:35:43,369 --> 05:35:44,330
All right.

1656
05:35:44,330 --> 05:35:46,009
Martin had a meme thanks to the 2,000 bits.

1657
05:35:46,569 --> 05:35:48,090
Scratch and sniff would be pretty cool,

1658
05:35:48,090 --> 05:35:49,610
except you guys can't smell it.

1659
05:35:49,610 --> 05:35:50,490
That'd be unfortunate.

1660
05:35:51,290 --> 05:35:52,669
Hey, Jay Bong.

1661
05:35:52,669 --> 05:35:53,709
Thanks for the 250.

1662
05:35:54,590 --> 05:35:55,840
What's up, Jerma?

1663
05:35:55,840 --> 05:35:57,360
I haven't been able to catch your streams for three days.

1664
05:35:57,360 --> 05:36:00,000
Gonna spend my time dealing with a huge sprained ankle.

1665
05:36:00,880 --> 05:36:04,080
No, knowing how to ice skate plus sketchy rental skates

1666
05:36:04,080 --> 05:36:05,119
don't look a good combo.

1667
05:36:06,240 --> 05:36:06,720
That hurts.

1668
05:36:08,430 --> 05:36:10,430
My ankle plumped up like a mango

1669
05:36:10,430 --> 05:36:12,990
and I'm bed bound for four to seven weeks.

1670
05:36:12,990 --> 05:36:13,790
Oh my God.

1671
05:36:16,729 --> 05:36:17,770
That's a long time.

1672
05:36:18,490 --> 05:36:21,979
The doc said it was a grade three sprain.

1673
05:36:22,619 --> 05:36:25,659
At least I'll be able to catch your famous yearly Christmas stream, right?

1674
05:36:26,540 --> 05:36:28,439
Should we tell him?

1675
05:36:29,000 --> 05:36:34,919
There's no Christmas stream this year.

1676
05:36:35,479 --> 05:36:36,599
It's the New Year's Eve stream.

1677
05:36:39,040 --> 05:36:42,880
You ever had a deal with a sprain ankle or sprained limb on a first timer?

1678
05:36:42,880 --> 05:36:43,599
No, not really.

1679
05:36:45,450 --> 05:36:50,569
I've had minor sprains, you know, minor twists on the ankle

1680
05:36:50,569 --> 05:36:52,250
or, you know, on a wrist or something,

1681
05:36:52,250 --> 05:36:55,450
but never something that put me in bed for like seven weeks.

1682
05:36:56,250 --> 05:37:00,490
Have you ever broken a bone?

1683
05:37:01,049 --> 05:37:01,290
No.

1684
05:37:02,029 --> 05:37:02,990
Well, no, that's not true.

1685
05:37:02,990 --> 05:37:06,360
I broke my collarbone when I was two years old.

1686
05:37:07,080 --> 05:37:11,240
I fell off a chair and shattered my collarbone.

1687
05:37:11,240 --> 05:37:14,650
I don't remember.

1688
05:37:14,650 --> 05:37:15,290
I don't know it.

1689
05:37:15,290 --> 05:37:15,930
I don't remember it.

1690
05:37:15,930 --> 05:37:16,650
I just know what happened.

1691
05:37:22,400 --> 05:37:22,720
Wimp?

1692
05:37:23,599 --> 05:37:27,360
Jesus.

1693
05:37:27,360 --> 05:37:28,159
Weak bones.

1694
05:37:28,799 --> 05:37:29,520
That's two.

1695
05:37:34,520 --> 05:37:36,279
The very first fall joke.

1696
05:37:43,080 --> 05:37:44,520
Thank you, Jay Blondell.

1697
05:37:44,520 --> 05:37:45,080
I've never had a...

1698
05:37:45,080 --> 05:37:46,759
I hope you get a swift recovery to you.

1699
05:37:47,400 --> 05:37:50,279
I've never had a broken bone like that or a sprained ankle.

1700
05:37:50,279 --> 05:37:51,720
It sounds like it's not very fun.

1701
05:37:52,759 --> 05:37:55,630
I cracked my skull open when I was four.

1702
05:37:55,630 --> 05:37:56,430
Beat that scrub.

1703
05:37:56,430 --> 05:37:57,069
I did that too.

1704
05:37:58,669 --> 05:38:01,310
I actually talked about that on stream when I was talking to Joel.

1705
05:38:02,110 --> 05:38:03,310
I did that too.

1706
05:38:03,310 --> 05:38:04,270
So you can't...

1707
05:38:04,270 --> 05:38:05,150
There's no one out there.

1708
05:38:06,189 --> 05:38:07,069
You and I are the same.

1709
05:38:07,790 --> 05:38:09,580
Sorry.

1710
05:38:11,310 --> 05:38:12,270
Hey, Yosher.

1711
05:38:12,270 --> 05:38:13,389
Master, thanks for the 500 bits.

1712
05:38:13,389 --> 05:38:15,069
Jerma, can you sort these bits for me?

1713
05:38:15,069 --> 05:38:17,470
Please lend me some of your processing power, Jerma IQ.

1714
05:38:19,150 --> 05:38:19,470
Sure.

1715
05:38:20,110 --> 05:38:26,970
Did you get some of that?

1716
05:38:27,689 --> 05:38:28,569
I released some.

1717
05:38:35,049 --> 05:38:36,490
That's what I was doing, the sorting algorithm.

1718
05:38:37,520 --> 05:38:38,319
You didn't get any?

1719
05:38:38,319 --> 05:38:39,040
Well, they went for you.

1720
05:38:40,000 --> 05:38:45,180
Can we do sorting algorithms one more time?

1721
05:38:45,180 --> 05:38:45,580
I'll do...

1722
05:38:45,580 --> 05:38:45,740
No.

1723
05:38:47,900 --> 05:38:51,020
Thank you, Yosher Master, and enjoy the Jerma IQ power.

1724
05:38:58,080 --> 05:39:01,119
Thank you, Nickly Bob for the thousand bits.

1725
05:39:02,159 --> 05:39:02,720
Thank you, Bob.

1726
05:39:03,360 --> 05:39:05,610
Ten dollars.

1727
05:39:05,610 --> 05:39:07,610
It's really nice to relax to your streams after work.

1728
05:39:07,610 --> 05:39:07,930
Thank you.

1729
05:39:08,810 --> 05:39:10,250
Glad you can hang out and relax.

1730
05:39:13,599 --> 05:39:14,319
Glad you can chill.

1731
05:39:19,740 --> 05:39:20,459
Glad you can chill.

1732
05:39:22,270 --> 05:39:23,869
Cold War Hall gave ten community subs.

1733
05:39:23,869 --> 05:39:24,189
Thank you.

1734
05:39:24,750 --> 05:39:26,110
Ampharic ten community subs.

1735
05:39:26,110 --> 05:39:27,389
I think we caught them, but seriously...

1736
05:39:27,389 --> 05:39:27,869
What's this?

1737
05:39:27,869 --> 05:39:28,590
Oh, let me mix...

1738
05:39:28,590 --> 05:39:29,069
Let me see.

1739
05:39:29,069 --> 05:39:29,549
Okay.

1740
05:39:29,549 --> 05:39:30,590
I want to see how bad this is.

1741
05:39:31,759 --> 05:39:33,680
Because I literally...

1742
05:39:33,680 --> 05:39:34,240
People would...

1743
05:39:34,240 --> 05:39:36,000
Like I said, people wanted to burn my house down for this one.

1744
05:39:36,000 --> 05:39:36,799
Let me see how bad this is.

1745
05:39:39,400 --> 05:39:44,360
I've never looked over and seen chat tell me how much they want me to fucking...

1746
05:39:45,000 --> 05:39:45,639
You know what I mean?

1747
05:39:46,279 --> 05:39:47,240
How bad was it?

1748
05:39:47,240 --> 05:39:50,380
Why'd it give me a bonus?

1749
05:39:50,380 --> 05:39:54,279
Jerma, you've been playing the chicken game since July.

1750
05:39:54,279 --> 05:39:54,919
Please stop.

1751
05:40:00,250 --> 05:40:08,400
Ayayayayayayayaya.

1752
05:40:08,400 --> 05:40:08,799
I did it.

1753
05:40:08,799 --> 05:40:09,439
Yeah, he said it.

1754
05:40:12,240 --> 05:40:16,540
Ayayayayayayayaya.

1755
05:40:16,540 --> 05:40:18,750
That wasn't even that bad.

1756
05:40:18,750 --> 05:40:19,709
That wasn't even that bad.

1757
05:40:19,709 --> 05:40:20,830
You guys overreacted.

1758
05:40:21,549 --> 05:40:23,069
Holy shit, you overreacted.

1759
05:40:24,560 --> 05:40:26,080
Wow what an overreaction to that.

1760
05:40:26,080 --> 05:40:26,799
I can't believe it.

1761
05:40:26,799 --> 05:40:28,799
I- you what an overreacted.

1762
05:40:28,799 --> 05:40:29,439
Okay.

1763
05:40:38,119 --> 05:40:39,639
What's that music?

1764
05:40:39,639 --> 05:40:46,669
Hey sad.

1765
05:40:47,709 --> 05:40:48,270
Vega.

1766
05:40:48,270 --> 05:40:49,630
Thanks for the 250.

1767
05:40:49,630 --> 05:40:53,259
So when can we expect the 10 Ghost Peppers to be eaten on stream?

1768

or the 50,000 USD excluding tax subs i think i mean if you all right you want to go there
