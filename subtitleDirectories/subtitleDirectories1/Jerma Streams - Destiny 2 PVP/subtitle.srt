1
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:19,319
Hey what's up everybody? I told you I'd be back and here I am. I gotta say I feel like a new man

2
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:29,399
after the last show. I feel reinvigorated. I feel HD. I feel like German. So I want to give a huge

3
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:35,079
shout out to all the actors that made it to the competition. Unfortunately none of them won.

4
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:41,079
I am still here. I still reign supreme. I want to give a huge shout out to Ludwig. Always good to

5
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,079
see him. It was a crazy show. What can I say? But I'm glad I'm still here and I'm glad I'm

6
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,920
still with all of you. That number 13 guy though, I don't know what he was thinking. He thought he

7
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,519
could take my spot. Instead he kind of showed up just looking like a poor man's Andrew Garfield and

8
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:05,800
good riddance. I don't know too. Like some of his stuff. The Nunchucks? Really? This day and age?

9
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,959
And how old was that guy? He looked 25 going on 50. It's like I'm glad you could do a cartwheel

10
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:20,360
but don't break a hip old man you know. So speaking of which, I am a new man. I'm here to do something

11
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,720
that I said that I would never do and that's to play Destiny 2. I know I said I'd never do it

12
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,800
but here we are and I want to give a big thanks to Ster and Doctor. I want to give a big thanks

13
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,079
to the Doctor for showing up. You guys are the best and you help make the magic happen.

14
00:05:41,639 --> 00:06:07,930
So let's do it without further ado. Okay we've got here. Looks good. Let me hit launch. Nice.

15
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:21,990
So I hate being forced to do this. This game is just insane but it's big. Sooner or later I guess

16
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,750
it had to happen but I gotta tell you I'm not happy about it. Pretty much every fiber of my being is

17
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:38,779
just ugh right now. But gotta make you guys happy so let's go. I mean honestly I'm only doing this

18
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:43,899
because I feel fresh. I mean granted my back hurts after all that breakdancing

19
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,939
but I mean I keep telling myself I'm not gonna break dance anymore but you know when you wear

20
00:06:50,939 --> 00:07:10,699
a leprechaun pimp outfit that shines like that how can you not bust a move seriously. Here we go.

21
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:30,040
Warp speed. This game takes forever to load. Piece of shit.

22
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:52,519
Control. Dominus cryo. The zones are yours if you fight for them guardian.

23
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:06,740
Okay here we go. What level are these people? That guy's level 459? Enemy claimed zone C. Yeah this is much better with the controller.

24
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:36,980
What's that? Auto isn't here. I'm still on location. You captured zone C. You have zone

25
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,139
advantage. Enemy claimed zone B. Enemy claimed zone B.

26
00:08:43,379 --> 00:09:08,659
Get some. Yeah baby. Oh platinum trickery. I feel like I kind of look like the moon knight.

27
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:36,539
Zone C lost. Enemy has zone advantage. Bench. Oh I drew a stun. So now I gotta kill that motherfucker

28
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:54,740
twice. Slide attack. I don't even know how to do that.

29
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:29,879
Yes. Race. One for one. Payback to me. Son of a bitch. Aaron! Aaron! What? What was that?

30
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:44,309
Some kind of crystal shield? This game is crazy. Blood.

31
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm going to kill you if it's the last thing I do with platinum trickery.

32
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:24,389
I wish they would just stay still for a little bit. You know considering how high level some of

33
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:34,200
these people are, I'm not doing as bad as I thought I would. Yes blood for blood. Love to see that.

34
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,259
Why do these things have to be so violent?

35
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,620
So yeah it was especially great to see the doctor. I haven't seen him in almost three years now.

36
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:11,340
He's been three years? That's crazy. Time just flies by. Time flies by and then someone named

37
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:36,409
Huckababy Brian shoots you in the face. That's life kiddos. He's dying. Turn it into ice cube.

38
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,309
Yeah get some. Get some.

39
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,090
Get happy. I don't even know what the plot is. It looks like we're just here to turn each other

40
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:17,210
into ice cube. Shoot each other with some kind of bdsm techno knife.

41
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:43,320
What? Just a little bit quicker on the draw. Can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear me? Where am I?

42
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:59,960
It's so cold in here. Hello? Is that the game? Did you guys hear that? I don't know what's talking in this game.

43
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:12,980
Take this without a fight. All right I guess they do talk. All right. You know I think I've died

44
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:34,409
enough. I think I'm gonna relax on the bed. Zone C captured. You have zone advantage.

45
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:44,629
We have zone advantage. Zone C lost. Enemy has advantage. Your enemy has defeated you. What?

46
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,909
This is when you have advantage to defeat within four seconds.

47
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:56,470
What is that? You eat monsters for breakfast. You can win a battle for territory. Again.

48
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:14,820
We lost! How much do we lose by? Yeah look at look at that. Combat efficiency.

49
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:24,470
Let's not look at that score again. All right well I think I'm done dying for a little bit.

50
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:40,779
I gotta go use the restroom. I know where I am. I know where I am. I am in the hotel room.

51
00:15:42,409 --> 00:16:40,759
I know. No it doesn't happen. No. I don't know how to do anything else.

52
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:52,360
Where am I? I don't even know where I am. I'm in some type of in-between area. I'm gonna haunt

53
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,779
these motherfuckers for the rest of their lives. I promise I'll haunt them forever.

54
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,329
Feels like I just got done pissing a sailboat. I don't know what's wrong with me.

55
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:57,500
All right let's try this again. This game has some weird audio. All right settings.

56
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:18,089
We're ranked seven out of. All right. Dr. Chunk invited us to the clan. That's that must mean

57
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:24,759
something good. We're not completely awful. All right well I'm gonna do something a little wild.

58
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:39,559
I'm gonna play backwards. Yeah this is how it's done. I can do this with one hand behind my back.

59
00:18:39,559 --> 00:19:00,380
One hand behind my back. That's the ship. We're taking the ship to war. Hey thank you so much

60
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:15,910
for the subs guys. Keep them coming. Let's take the ship. Keep them rolling. So we're guardians?

61
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:27,700
What are we guarding? I'm talking to you. Whoa okay that. I'm talking to you right now.

62
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:42,809
What? Did you guys hear that on the chat? It's not the game. Number 13. Number 13's not here.

63
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:02,759
No beginners here. Yes front desk please. Your team is relying on you. Hi um I've been hearing

64
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:08,680
some strange noises in my room. No I didn't. Is there something wrong with the piping or?

65
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:24,890
It sounded like a voice. I know it sounds crazy. All right weird question. Has anyone died in here

66
00:20:24,890 --> 00:21:01,609
recently? I'm sorry guys. I'm hearing a voice that's not in the game. It doesn't sound like that.

67
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:05,930
The enemy is ahead but you can change that.

68
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:19,880
Okay. He'll never do this boss like he just did. Is there like a ghost in this game or something?

69
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:31,099
Chat is there is there a ghost in this game? There's a ghost in your room number 13.

70
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:41,769
I'm not number 13. I'm Jerma. I'm just trying to play this game.

71
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,019
We killed you 13. We killed you.

72
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:58,980
Because sometimes you have to grow as a person. You can't always do the same thing.

73
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:14,710
Okay guys I'm really getting creeped out right now. He sounds just like me.

74
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,450
On the plus side at least we won.

75
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:34,279
I have this image on the screen. It's a big red pulsating mass. You should probably look at it.

76
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:52,009
A pulsating mass? What is that voice? It's getting cold in here.

77
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:06,039
People are the horror. It's like someone turned the temperature down in here.

78
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,839
They don't care they're not freezing. They're just gonna shoot me anyway.

79
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:25,220
You've seen their strategy in action. Time to counter.

80
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:43,140
I think it's gone now. Guys this is the scariest room I've ever done.

81
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:51,349
It doesn't help because I haven't played this game before. I don't think I'll be playing it again.

82
00:23:51,349 --> 00:24:03,190
I'll tell you that. All right well weird stuff happens. Anyway let's talk about the show huh?

83
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:10,869
That was one of the craziest rooms we've ever done. It was a lot of fun. Some of the actors

84
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:18,309
phenomenal talents. You've seen those impressions. Time to counter. Some of the musicians

85
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:26,660
they needed a little help. Some of it was excellent. Really amazing. Meeting Connor was fun.

86
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:34,039
Meeting Connor was an honor. That rhymes. I'm a poet I didn't know it.

87
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:55,289
All right. These guys jump. Every time I start to hit somebody they jump.

88
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:13,029
That's all right. Stand up and fight again. Combat efficiency zero. Zero. That's one less than one.

89
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:25,240
No heavy ammo. Why does ammo have to be heavy? Best serve cold.

90
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:36,089
They don't stand a chance.

91
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,990
I'm not going to show my feet. I'm not going to show my feet. Trust me you don't want to see it.

92
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:53,910
Match point. Time to wipe the smugness from your opponent's face. I've got hobbit feet.

93
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:11,740
Gangly toenails. Yeah let's try going to a different one. Yeah sneak up on them. It's

94
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:19,859
like an office building in the future that's just been torn apart by a warfare. Stop jumping.

95
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:33,990
Ah come on. What is this? I'm like glowing.

96
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:55,450
I'm not a ghost. This is freaky. I can't wait to get out of this hotel. I don't even know.

97
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,579
Honestly though I'm lasting longer than I thought I would. That's what she said.

98
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:20,819
Triumph completed. Learn from this moment. Learn from this moment. This game sucks.

99
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:33,930
Graphics are nice but I want to get killed in three seconds flat like this. Well when I went

100
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:41,319
on and on and said I would never play this game now I know why. I'm always right. Even when I'm

101
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:48,359
wrong I'm right. Just like the talent show. You could say I was wrong. I didn't let anyone win.

102
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,799
But you know what? I'm right. Might makes right. Winner winner chicken dinner and who's sitting

103
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:10,789
here. Yeah I think we're going to ban that guy that suggested it for an hour. Banned. Ban him.

104
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:21,859
So this is the spaceship that just keeps taking me to my doom. Floating there like a high tech one.

105
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:37,289
Number 15. I finally was able to have enough energy to go through the first door and

106
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:43,609
10 locked doors. Where I can find the key. There's a whole game I'm playing for number 13.

107
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:51,210
I'm playing an escape room in purgatory and you better believe I get out of the second door.

108
00:28:52,170 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll have enough power to do all kinds of other things. I would suggest number 13

109
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:13,420
that you leave that. Leave this place and never return. But before you go to number 13.

110
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,950
If you could possibly look under the bed and see if there's a number because I'm missing the middle

111
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:32,869
number in this locked second door and it might be under that. If I do will you leave me alone?

112
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:53,420
Oh I will leave you alone. Okay. Is there a number under that good? Number 13. Go chat.

113
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:07,339
I feel the chat. They say. Okay. They say. It's one of those shitty hotel room beds. There is no

114
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:15,349
number. There's it's just a block under here. There's nothing under here. What? I swear I try.

115
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:25,000
There's nothing under here. Dude there has to be a number. I'll look again. There's not a number

116
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,990
under there. What check? Check the ceiling. Is there any four or five? Just look at the corner

117
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:53,529
and the ceiling. These games are so easy. Is there a number in the ceiling? Oh my god. What does it

118
00:30:53,529 --> 00:31:07,130
say? Yeah. What does it say? I can't believe this. Yeah there was a number.

119
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:18,680
7.3? 7.3? What does that mean? 7.3. Okay. All right. Thank you. No I actually really appreciate it.

120
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,480
Thank you. That that helps you somehow? Yeah. Thank you so much. Just you go back to whatever

121
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,359
you're doing. You can play that stupid ass game. I am about to solve also say I'm gonna get you

122
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:37,000
second at work. Oh thank you so much. Seriously thank you. Glad I could help. But still like

123
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,759
fuck you and like yeah I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life and all you grandkids.

124
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:51,000
My grandkids too? Oh my grandkids. I thought I thought if I helped you you wouldn't haunt me.

125
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,400
You're always going back on your word.

126
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:09,480
Is that scary? Yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna do about this. It's actually just kind of fun.

127
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,140
I think I'm gonna stay like this. Stay in. You know they show up like every week ever maybe.

128
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,789
Wow. So it's it's fun being a ghost? It's actually pretty cool. You can get you can see any movie ever

129
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:27,109
made in the video game you've made. It's actually really awesome. I'll bet ghost is popular.

130
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:32,470
And you can keep this shit. This this real world shit it's it's no good.

131
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:42,380
No it's fun. You're you're in a lot of trouble. If it's fun to haunt too. It's funny I can chase

132
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,740
people like the people I can like hide in a chaining and be like Santa Claus and stuff.

133
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,500
It's really relatable. That does sound fun. Do you like watch people make out and stuff?

134
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,500
No. I don't know why that's the first thing I thought of it. No. What? Yeah no I'm like that.

135
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,140
I guess I was like if I was a ghost it might be one of the first things I do.

136
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:15,750
Well I'm losing power. I'm losing power. I wish you luck but it sounds like you don't. No no no.

137
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:19,029
Thanks for the number dude but there are a lot of children when I get

138
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:25,529
when I get more power you're you're lost. You took everything from me even though it's really
