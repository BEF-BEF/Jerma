1
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:28,870
Hey, what's up? What's happening? How's it going?

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:37,219
Hope you're enjoying your long weekend here. Not over yet.

3
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,329
Tonight, tonight going to be playing a sorcery part four pick up right where we

4
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:57,100
left off. Sorcery council. It should be here. It is,

5
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,060
it is nine people. So we got to make sure they're here. By the way,

6
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,260
the sorcery council changes every week. I don't even know who's on it anymore.

7
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,420
Sorcery squad. There's one, there's one.

8
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:28,959
There's one of the council members right there. Okay. Did you ever know? No.

9
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:41,680
All right. Are you guys ready? Is ready to get back into sorcery.

10
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,730
I think there's probably going to be another, I am.

11
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,489
I'm trying to think of how long this took last time.

12
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:54,750
We've done one three, four hours stream in part four.

13
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,739
I think it's about 15 ish, 17 ish hours,

14
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:08,590
which is removing the moments feature. Yeah.

15
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,930
We didn't really care too much about them here. Anyways,

16
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,370
aren't half of the moments on this channel, just complete fucking nonsense.

17
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,530
I think I specifically did like seven in a row. That just meant nothing.

18
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,979
My accolades. We cared. I cared. Oh, remember we cared. Oh,

19
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,289
I just, I'm sorry. Tell me how you really feel.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,639
All, all seven. Oh my God.

21
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:47,110
They're kind of a pain to get right since you had to fit a moment in a 60 second

22
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,729
clip. I don't think there was anything wrong with them. It's a cool idea,

23
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,090
but I, I didn't really, I mean, mods would use it sometimes.

24
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,330
I did that one time last year.

25
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,370
I just removed them all for the month because that was funny. Oh, whatever.

26
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:10,819
Apparently that's going away. I, that's new news to me, bro.

27
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,659
Stop distracting me. I'm writing a research paper. Devil spawn.

28
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:33,740
What are you writing your paper about? Devil spawn? That's your question.

29
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,139
I mean like, well, how about this? Go do your homework. What do you go?

30
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:48,219
Do your paper? I only watch clip compilations.

31
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,979
When do you start being funny? Uh, never again. I'm officially retired.

32
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,659
So, um, literally never again. So sorry. You probably have to find some,

33
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:02,719
you're probably gonna have to find it somewhere else. I'm never gonna,

34
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:16,449
I'm never gonna make a joke ever again. Ever. I still got it.

35
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,910
I still got it.

36
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,850
And that person for even questioning if I would make a funny noise,

37
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,689
I know that's not what they said, but I don't care. All right. You guys ready?

38
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,949
My mother got food poisoning. How do I help? Okay. First of all,

39
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,819
sorry to hear that. Second of all, just if your mother yells down,

40
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,250
I need a Gatorade. You go get the fucking Gatorade. You understand?

41
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:12,870
You go get it. Did you see the hard drive article? I did very recently.

42
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,949
Like that was the one that was the last thing that I saw before turning the

43
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:22,139
stream on. It was like, Hey, did you see this? I was like, Oh,

44
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,980
I guess yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I, okay. I don't, I'll tell you, I don't,

45
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,160
I try not to pay that much attention to many things because I'm,

46
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,879
I told you I'm very disconnected from social media. So sometimes I'll just hear,

47
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:44,720
Hey dude, look at this. Do you see this picture of your face? I,

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,939
I guess what's the context of this picture? So that's cool though.

49
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,810
That's fun. I mean, there are things that I, you know, I,

50
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:01,850
what was written about me, you know, my accolades. That's cool with me.

51
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,410
You're going to write about my accolades then. Absolutely. I'd love to read it.

52
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:23,939
Somebody said it good. Humble brag. Do you feel like a celebrity?

53
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,579
No, no. I don't fucking want to be a celebrity. No,

54
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,779
that's we're not going to use that language. I am an E clown and that's it.

55
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,129
I am a certified E clown with my own certification. I certified myself.

56
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,170
Don't call me that. Call me an E clown. But no, I mean, it's a bit,

57
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,009
I guess it depends.

58
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,980
I try to stay grounded because I don't want to think of myself that way because

59
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:00,800
then it's like, Mr. Celebrity, look at me. No, don't.

60
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,779
I just make jokes on the internet sometimes. All right, you guys good.

61
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:15,829
Let's go. They picked the worst picture for that article.

62
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,060
You look deranged in it. Guys,

63
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,759
there are no pictures of me where I don't look like that. Do you understand?

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,480
I have never in 13 years straight,

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I have never gotten in front of a camera that was taking still photography to

66
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:41,629
use anywhere like, Oh, Hey, of course I had to get my headshots.

67
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,339
I had to get my pictures taken.

68
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,230
Every picture of me on the internet is of me sitting in a chair with a blown up

69
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,470
webcam image. Cause it's always at the bottom of the screen,

70
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,589
or it's running at such a shit bit rate that even when it is blown up,

71
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:02,319
it looks terrible. I've never taken like real professional headshots.

72
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:11,899
The dollhouse. Yeah.

73
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:16,899
The reason why people use that dollhouse image from like the red sex thing is

74
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
because that's probably one of the only front facing pictures I have of myself.

75
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:27,160
That's the only one where the angle is correct for my face.

76
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:40,820
All the other ones are just weird. Taken from a webcam. Stop stalling. Hey,

77
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm going to stall as long as I want. Your stream, your stream is too high quality.

78
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,860
No, it's not stalled more. But it's funny that, uh,

79
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,940
we've all seen the picture of me leaning back with my mouth open and my teeth

80
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,460
showing that's used a lot. It's funny. Like, Oh, Hey, what do you think? Hey,

81
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,259
here's a picture of Jerma that we're going to use the one where he's leaning

82
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:14,259
back with his mouth open and his teeth out and his mouth is just open sitting

83
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:21,179
back in a chair. But who cares? I don't care.

84
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,409
If I cared I would have gotten pictures taken a long, long time ago. Which one?

85
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,929
You know, the one, it's the one where I'm leaning. My mouth is open.

86
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:32,889
My teeth are kind of showing and my head's tilted. My teeth are,

87
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,720
my front teeth are showing you. It's you guys know which one, cause there's three.

88
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:47,769
There were three pictures of me. It's it's two. But anyways, you guys, right?

89
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:58,980
Let's go. We literally don't know the picture. You do.

90
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,700
You know, you know, the picture. Okay. You ready? What's he talking about?

91
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,820
Uh, you kind of, you need to know. We're talking about,

92
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,980
there was an article that was written about me. It was a jokey article.

93
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,799
It was funny. It was on hard drive. They're funny. And, uh, yeah,

94
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:20,750
you, the mods got it and we were just talking about it for a few seconds.

95
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,580
They got your job wrong. They said digital clown.

96
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,029
It's not accurate. Okay, let's go. That was an 11 minute stall.

97
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,110
No, that's it. That's amateur hour. That is nothing.

98
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:51,309
I've stalled for like 40 minutes before. That's nothing. That's nothing. Okay,

99
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:57,070
here we go. Uh, TLDR. Hope you're having a good weekend. Hope you're, uh,

100
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,370
let's go. I'm going to go. All right. You emerged from the alley into the,

101
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,610
why did I need to stop to do that?

102
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,620
You emerged from the alley into the edge of the main square.

103
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:13,720
What happened last episode? Everybody. We got into,

104
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,909
uh, we made it into Isamu. We made it into Manpang.

105
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:26,220
We are now at the steps of the fortress of the Archmage.

106
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:30,779
Such a teacher question. Yeah.

107
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,139
I just told you guys to open up your textbooks. So where do we leave off? Okay.

108
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,779
In my sorcery playthrough,

109
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,450
would you guys have a lot more fun in school if you had homework based on these

110
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,980
streams?

111
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,659
You had to come back with like a worksheet filled out of what we did today.

112
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,049
I feel like that wouldn't be awful. All right,

113
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:56,889
I'm going to go right into the square.

114
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:06,899
You would be getting a very poor education if you did, if that happened. All right.

115
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,220
The air moves a little around you still icy, but fresh.

116
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,980
You stride out into the middle of the public square where Manpang's inhabitants

117
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,899
go about their business.

118
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,029
In the center is a huge statue of a faceless man holding a crown aloft.

119
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:33,049
The Archmage. Let's look at it. Look around.

120
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,610
Many people here are simply passing through,

121
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,809
but several are browsing the market on the West side.

122
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,529
You also spot several guards to the North clustered around a road that leads

123
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,639
upwards. And look at the statue.

124
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,730
The statue seems unimaginably old and yet the Archmage depicted

125
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,370
here is definitely holding the crown of Kings.

126
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,850
Has he been planning this theft for such a long time then?

127
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:02,809
Or is this prophecy a celebration of a day destined to come?

128
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:16,799
I forget what you can do here. Should I give the statue depression?

129
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,649
The statue is not an animal. I don't think we can talk to it. Zap it?

130
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,460
I don't think that's a good idea either. Can I read the statue's mind?

131
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,220
Drawing the skull cap from your pack, you cast a spell.

132
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,659
From all around the square come a multitude of, oh, it's everybody.

133
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:53,139
A multitude of thoughts. You concentrate to pick one out.

134
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,059
A nearby monk is shaking with fear.

135
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,169
Those red eyes, they are God fearing, but I fear them.

136
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,519
Remove the cap once more.

137
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,649
There are guards patrolling more frequently even here.

138
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:11,860
They're patrolling frequently even here. You'll have to be careful to blend in.

139
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,460
I think it's just sus. That's the easy, that we're doing sus. Come on.

140
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,220
You turn the starlight into alignment around you.

141
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,379
A calm voice speaks into your thoughts.

142
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,350
You receive a strong feeling of trepidation about the alley to the East.

143
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,070
Being so near the gates means there is a greater number of merchants and

144
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,710
travelers here. The further into the keep you go,

145
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,590
the inhabitants will become increasingly wary of outsiders.

146
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,519
Maybe I can't really do anything with it. What if I go, what can I make?

147
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:07,679
Can I just make a move? Oh shit. All right. Now this is important. All right.

148
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,330
Where are we going? Remember, I don't have any rewinds.

149
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,590
So this is important. I don't know if I want to put all these on a pole,

150
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,480
but I'm going to pick out a few.

151
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:27,980
I'm going to pick out archway. So in here, this building here,

152
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,370
I'm going to pick out North side.

153
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,009
So archway North or the market.

154
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,649
So we're going to go up North, which goes up here.

155
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,299
East goes into this archway or West to the market. We can get a pole.

156
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:58,730
One of the moderators can do that. Please. It would be awesome. Uh, okay.

157
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,059
Markets are always fun. They are always fun. But what's in this building?

158
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:14,980
I got a raspberry tea tonight. Anybody was keeping score. It's good.

159
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:26,740
Go to the bathroom. I already did. Why would you? Okay.

160
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,809
Oh, what are the pole? Uh, the options are North archway or market.

161
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,320
A lot of decisions to make. Go pee. I, I,

162
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,750
I try to go empty my bladder and other areas before stream because I don't want

163
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,629
to have to get up. I want to be able to sit here for at least an hour or two.

164
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:58,919
Why did you phrase it like that? I don't know. Because people are weird.

165
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,259
Because if I said, well,

166
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,579
you see what I do before every stream is I take the shit and I empty my fuck.

167
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,940
I piss. Someone would be like, Oh, he said these words. I'm going to clip it.

168
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:23,029
He shit his pants. He said he shit his pants today. That's a lot more normal.

169
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,930
Hey, thanks for the clip. Yeah, you're welcome. Paranoid.

170
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:45,460
I mean, I'm fucking around. All right, where are we going? Market. Okay,

171
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:53,380
let's go. The market is busy with traders and stalls, a city in miniature.

172
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:57,109
The market is not as large as those you encountered in Kare,

173
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:00,349
but still it bustles with life. Even in Mampang,

174
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:08,019
people need to go about their day. All right, let's go to the stalls.

175
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,269
Most of the stalls are mundane, roughly made household goods in some trinkets.

176
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:20,390
Despite the number of shoppers, there are in fact very few goods,

177
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,069
but as you wander the stalls, the stands,

178
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
you do spot a weapons dealer,

179
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,039
flaunting his wares and a bent backed peddler with unusual items spread on a

180
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,450
cloth. All right. Weapons dealer or the peddler.

181
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:43,880
I have a bunch of really great, I have great weapons right now at the trinkets.

182
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,750
Oh my God. That's what I was thinking. He's just chill.

183
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:56,970
The peddler smiles as you approach any gestures across a motley collection of

184
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,289
objects laid out on a blanket, this chipped pottery,

185
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:05,089
dull knives and an empty picture frame. The man is not old,

186
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:11,329
but a hard life has aged his looks. Junk, refuse,

187
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:17,740
memorabilia, all for the discerning customer. Where are you from?

188
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,380
Shores of Lake Eklalala originally, but that was long ago.

189
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,579
I took to wandering at a young age and finished up here.

190
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:36,700
Not what I hoped for really. Oh, I can sell stuff. Should I sell the gems?

191
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,059
Why are you selling junk? He cackles,

192
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:47,750
which ends in a tremendous coughing fit. Oh,

193
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,950
you know another person's treasure, right?

194
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,309
Some of these can be used for magic. I am no sorcerer,

195
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:06,569
just a man with a good eye for value. I've learned.

196
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,250
There are those out there who know a worthy purchase when they see it.

197
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,259
How did you come across these things? He points to a dried flower.

198
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,809
That I found in the back pocket of a sleeping werewolf.

199
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:28,970
This clue I won from a man in a contest of riddles. And this mirror,

200
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,130
I found dangling from a tree in an ancient swamp.

201
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,000
You are quite the adventurer. In my youth, I was many things.

202
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
An excellent dancer, for instance.

203
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,519
I fathered 47 children by that particular skill.

204
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:52,349
He scratches his nose. You're going to buy anything? 47 children. Okay.

205
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,230
Scrutinizing his assortment of junk.

206
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:58,470
You can see few items that would be useful to you.

207
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,990
47 children by being a good dancer.

208
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:16,140
Somebody said it, right? Yep. Somebody said puzzler.

209
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:24,029
The puzzler. In every state, in every country.

210
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:37,349
Um, what do I need? I kind of have everything I need,

211
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,400
but maybe the mirror.

212
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,119
You pick up the gold backed mirror and admire yourself in it.

213
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,069
The peddler smiles and hands over the mirror. It still may smell of swamp.

214
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,569
It's 48 gold pieces. It is too expensive. You replace it on the rug.

215
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,460
That is way too expensive.

216
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:12,240
Why do I have to pay the amount of children he has in gold pieces?

217
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:23,670
That's weird. What about the gems? Do you buy as well? I have gems for sale.

218
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,680
Gems? No, no point in me buying gems.

219
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,720
What would happen if I put them out on my rug here, do you think?

220
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:38,339
Would I make my money back? I don't think so. Who might take them?

221
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,799
Try Hummingbird, the weapons dealer. He's nuts.

222
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,160
He waves at his wares again. His previous grin returning. Okay.

223
00:22:51,269 --> 00:23:03,930
Um, so that, this is kind of unfortunate. Limberry potion.

224
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,690
You lift the vial of potion carefully. Fresh, the peddler says.

225
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:13,599
Oh, fresh enough anyway. Yours for 30 gold. Yeah. What is going on here?

226
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,150
Why so much? You inquire. He shrugs.

227
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:23,440
You seen any blimberries around here? You put it back. Okay.

228
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,619
But this is all going to be too expensive. Yeah. A giant's tooth for 39 gold for

229
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:37,140
one giant's tooth. No. What about the glue?

230
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:42,049
Have a lot of spilling. Peddler says, as you lift the vial of glue,

231
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,420
it's 24 gold pieces. You smile weakly. You put it back down on the mat.

232
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,660
You decide to take your leave. The peddler wishes you safe travels with a wink.

233
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,950
Okay. Well that guy was not very helpful. The mirror probably was worth it,

234
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,299
but let's go sell our gems. You approach the weapon stall.

235
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,740
The trader is extraordinarily thin. He might disappear if he turned sideways.

236
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:14,750
Welcome friend. The army has procured most of my goods,

237
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:17,910
but I have a few items left to sell for my original stock.

238
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:26,519
You buy gemstones? I might, may I see? Perhaps a trade in kind.

239
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,089
Is he going to run if I give these to him? Gems for a sword.

240
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,859
I might let him see them. Gems for a sword, you ask? How about this?

241
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,700
He lifts a cutlass from the mat. It really is my finest blade. Strong,

242
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,640
supple perfection. Where did you get it?

243
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:01,369
It washed up in the fountain of the merchant's yard. To my very great surprise,

244
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,130
the fountains are fed by rivers.

245
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,809
I suppose something must have sunk somewhere once upon a time.

246
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:14,160
Or else someone dropped it there by accident. Is that any good though?

247
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:26,019
I don't think I'm doing this. He stole it off a corpse. I mean,

248
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:29,299
it is episode four. We don't have very many other places to spend this stuff.

249
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,279
We are at the last episode, so can't take it with us.

250
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:40,319
So I don't know if there's another opportunity to get rid of these gems.

251
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,380
There might be, I don't remember. Stop buying so many swords.

252
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,440
You're like Finn, but worse. I do have a lot of weapons. That's true.

253
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,599
How many do we have? All right. If we have more than three, I won't buy it.

254
00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:00,059
One sword, one long sword, one assassin's sword,

255
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,660
one blessed hardwood spear, one chopping knife, one hefty arrow,

256
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,779
one hewing axe, one chakram, and a silver chain.

257
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:17,960
This is more than three. This is way more than three. There's a lot of weapons.

258
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,839
You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. All right. You're right.

259
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,029
You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. Don't buy the sword.

260
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,089
I don't want it. It's not what I want. You shake your head.

261
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:31,130
That's the best blade I have.

262
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,990
And I don't have enough gold on me to buy them outright. Sorry, friend.

263
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,140
No deal. What do you have? Is everything besides weapons?

264
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,160
But it is the weapons dealer. What do you have?

265
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,559
I can see you're a seasoned one,

266
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,039
so I won't waste your time with the lumps the common soldier gets stuck with.

267
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,099
I have this broad sword, which I can let go for, say,

268
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,539
15 gold pieces.

269
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,240
And the best sword in my possession is this cutlass for 600 gold pieces.

270
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,680
Of course, at these prices, you are practically robbing me,

271
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,039
but then so has everyone else in this place. 600 gold.

272
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:20,940
It was a plus six cutlass. What?

273
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,849
Your prices are too expensive. He shakes his head.

274
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,809
This is the best you'll find in this fortress.

275
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,730
I am nearly destitute thanks to Nighlok. I cannot go any lower.

276
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,210
But 600 gold pieces.

277
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,079
Somebody said go back. There is no going back.

278
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,539
There are no more rewinds.

279
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:53,410
We have to live with whatever happens here.

280
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,289
This is no ordinary cutlass.

281
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:57,450
The edge is unbreakable. The weight is perfect.

282
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:00,289
The blade cannot be dropped or slipped from the hand.

283
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:01,650
It cannot miss.

284
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,890
This blade will make you all but invincible.

285
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,059
Oh, spit in my... It's pretty good, see?

286
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,519
He pauses to wipe spit from his mouth.

287
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,740
That's such a gross sentence.

288
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,539
Give me a better deal.

289
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,140
Friend, this morning, a beast man was so upset about the price

290
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,980
he threatened me with the very sword I was trying to sell him.

291
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,819
I can see you have a lot to learn about haggling in Mampang.

292
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:31,309
You've seen enough.

293
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,660
You nod to the trader.

294
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,339
Are you not from Mampang?

295
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,660
There are safer trade routes. Yes, I know.

296
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:42,740
But as a bold young man, I heard that the archmage was offering

297
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,819
a fortune for weapons.

298
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,900
The trader waves his hand vaguely,

299
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,059
outfitting a new army or something.

300
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,700
I am not so sure.

301
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,059
Of course, once I got here.

302
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,579
Well, hmm.

303
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,470
What happened?

304
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,910
He glances at a passing guard and lowers his voice.

305
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,259
That snake Nylok would only pay me half

306
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,940
and left me stuck on the wrong side of the wall.

307
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:09,779
But what could I do?

308
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,700
If I tried to leave, some bird man would have no doubt swooped down and...

309
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,930
Quiet?

310
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,170
Swooped down.

311
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,230
And that would have been the end of it.

312
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,470
At least I'm in a state to appreciate my poverty.

313
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:28,349
But what can I do for you?

314
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,160
Nylok.

315
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
He makes a rude noise.

316
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,519
Bleh!

317
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,440
The archmage is official merchant.

318
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,720
She handles all the trade for Mampang.

319
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
Not us.

320
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,940
And he gestures to the crowds.

321
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,299
But the fortress, the guard encampment around the tower.

322
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:46,779
I suppose she's now chiefly interested in outfitting the army.

323
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
An army?

324
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Oh, oh, indeed.

325
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,920
Though I couldn't tell you who they're supposed to be fighting.

326
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,960
Everyone outside the walls is now dead.

327
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
Or so they say.

328
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,680
Now, are you going to buy something or are we to simply chatter like

329
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,799
a clatter man's grandmother?

330
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,589
Farewell.

331
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:13,059
Farewell, then do come back.

332
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,220
Everyone is dead.

333
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Oh, no.

334
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,859
Is it getting close to your Sheldon impression?

335
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:27,470
Well, my my my siblings were very interesting people.

336
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:31,109
My sister at dinner one time.

337
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:39,140
Oh, shit. It is.

338
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:46,900
All right, let's go to the tents.

339
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,019
Hold on.

340
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:50,299
How close to Bugleberry is my Sheldon?

341
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:53,289
There was a time.

342
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,410
My sister, my sister.

343
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,670
There was a time.

344
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:06,140
There was there was a time.

345
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,940
Or is it just the Joker?

346
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:14,650
You'll never know.

347
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,730
Omegalul stop.

348
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,930
You can't write that and then say stop.

349
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,170
All right.

350
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,650
There are a few large tents set up some and some stone buildings, too.

351
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,240
There's a hawker loudly proclaiming that mysteries and wonders

352
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,029
await in his tent.

353
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,630
In one corner, a long line of creatures queue outside of a low stone building.

354
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,319
Fortune teller, the hawker.

355
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,839
We were already here.

356
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:47,180
Maybe I should just get a weapon.

357
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,559
Fortune teller.

358
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,440
We need food.

359
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,799
Yes, we do.

360
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,630
Let's go to fortune teller.

361
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,670
I love that, by the way, though.

362
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:05,599
I'm not sure if you could hear it.

363
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,240
You join a long line of creatures outside the low stone

364
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,039
building of the fortune teller.

365
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:14,009
They're waiting with surprising patience.

366
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,380
Let's talk to the creature ahead of me.

367
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,779
The creature in front of you is a hobgoblin with long blonde hair

368
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,980
and two protruding hooked teeth.

369
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,140
Why is everyone waiting?

370
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,579
You ask?

371
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,599
You don't know.

372
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,839
Why are you waiting here if you don't know?

373
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,490
I saw the line.

374
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,450
So you just joined?

375
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,720
Well, I suppose when I first joined the line, it was for the same reason.

376
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:50,940
But it seems so long ago now.

377
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,069
How long have you been waiting?

378
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,549
This time?

379
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:57,950
A few hours, maybe.

380
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,390
What do you mean this time?

381
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,549
Well, this isn't my first visit.

382
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,589
No one visits wide only once.

383
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,170
Did you say wide?

384
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,450
That's right.

385
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,049
Fair and wide.

386
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:15,569
The great seer of Lower Manpang.

387
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,549
See, you have heard of them.

388
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,769
She pauses to scratch her chin.

389
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,849
If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to waiting.

390
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,250
I saw something over in chat and I have to say it because it was very funny.

391
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,089
Somebody said wisdom teeth voice.

392
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:50,269
OK, I get it.

393
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:52,250
Come on, I'm acting here.

394
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,930
All right, you I'm going to wait.

395
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,609
You wait.

396
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:59,529
A thin creature emerges from the building with a curious half smile on his face.

397
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,450
The next creature, a dwarf enters.

398
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,210
I pushed to the front.

399
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,500
Now we're going to wait.

400
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,940
You continue waiting.

401
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,710
Nothing happens.

402
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,590
You wait.

403
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,500
You continue to wait.

404
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,139
And the dwarf emerges.

405
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,780
She, too, has a curious half smile on her face.

406
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,050
A black elf goes inside next.

407
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,809
You wait.

408
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,010
You keep waiting.

409
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,139
You wait.

410
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,380
You wait a little longer.

411
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,409
You damn it.

412
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,929
I didn't mean to do that.

413
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,969
I clicked the wrong thing.

414
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,730
You step out of the line.

415
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,690
The creatures who have joined behind you hurry forward to fill the space.

416
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,539
And as they do so, you see it is the thin creature whom you saw

417
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:38,820
coming out of the building.

418
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,539
He has rejoined the line directly behind you.

419
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,530
Return to the line. Shit.

420
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,900
You go back to the line to rejoin.

421
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,420
To your surprise, the creature shuffled back to let you slot

422
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,599
into your previous place.

423
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,760
The hobgoblin you spoke to before even spares you a faint smile.

424
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,420
What? Wait.

425
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,820
The black elf emerges looking furious about something.

426
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,099
A wood golem enters the building.

427
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:08,389
You wait.

428
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:11,309
Creatures in the line stir a little, but no one leaves the queue.

429
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:16,119
Wait. You keep waiting.

430
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:16,800
You keep waiting.

431
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,679
The wood golem emerges looking furious about something.

432
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,960
A goblin goes inside.

433
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,289
We wait. You wait a little longer.

434
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,780
The creature in the line stir.

435
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,010
You wait.

436
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,170
Goblin emerges looking furious about something.

437
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:39,309
The hobgoblin is next.

438
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,150
Wait. You keep waiting.

439
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,079
You keep waiting.

440
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,460
You wait a little longer.

441
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,099
The hobgoblin emerges looking furious about something.

442
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,329
A guard enters the building.

443
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:59,159
Wait. Keep waiting.

444
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,900
The guard emerges looking furious.

445
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,739
A small moth child goes inside.

446
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:09,269
Does this matter?

447
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:13,699
I forget if this matters. I don't remember.

448
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:15,420
You wait. Wait.

449
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,449
The creatures stir. You wait.

450
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,610
A small moth child emerges looking furious.

451
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,730
Everyone. OK. The first three people were happy.

452
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,130
The next six people have been very, very mad.

453
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,300
Hold on a second.

454
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,539
OK. Thin creature emerges from the building with a smile.

455
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,760
OK. A thin creature.

456
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,500
Smile. Dwarf.

457
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,760
Smiled. Black elf.

458
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,179
Angry. Everything has been angry.

459
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,019
OK, let's keep waiting.

460
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,239
You wait a little longer.

461
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,739
Keep waiting.

462
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:05,619
The rat faced orc emerges looking furious about something.

463
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,860
The one legged dwarf enters the building.

464
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:16,829
OK. OK. OK.

465
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,679
A lanky guard goes inside.

466
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:23,420
I feel like patience is going to pay off here.

467
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,230
I don't remember what happens.

468
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,869
OK. Black elf is next.

469
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:36,159
Did I not get to go?

470
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,539
Wood golem enters the building.

471
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:42,019
How come I got passed in line like three times?

472
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:46,179
Goblin goes inside.

473
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:46,739
I've been passed.

474
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,179
I've been I'm being I'm being toted in Mario Kart.

475
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,260
They're lapping me.

476
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,389
You wait. Hobgoblin is.

477
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,110
All right.

478
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:10,019
I don't know. Should I just go for it?

479
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:14,179
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

480
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:16,300
All right. I need a poll because I actually I don't know what to do.

481
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,710
If it were me, I would have pushed to the front.

482
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,539
But I don't know.

483
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,179
Yeah, well, we need to pull.

484
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:29,920
I can get this one. It's quick.

485
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,880
Which one?

486
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,980
Wait or push to front.

487
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:50,280
Here we go. Which way are we going?

488
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,139
I think I know where we're going.

489
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:53,139
You need to wait your turn.

490
00:38:53,139 --> 00:39:03,429
Be polite. Be polite.

491
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:06,019
I'll wait all fucking day.

492
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:09,099
That's a great comment.

493
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,579
You know, that person wrote that.

494
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,019
I'll wait all fucking day.

495
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,099
And you know why they said that?

496
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,449
Because they have ready.

497
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:17,409
They've got they got food in front of them.

498
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:19,699
They've got a full drink.

499
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,780
They're comfortable in their seat on the couch.

500
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,179
Maybe they're ready.

501
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:32,730
They're they're locked in for the long haul.

502
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,809
Hey, I'll wait all fucking day.

503
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:36,789
They take their phone.

504
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:37,789
They put it on silent.

505
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:40,019
They put it face down.

506
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:46,800
I ain't taking any calls today.

507
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:55,360
All right. We're doing this one more time.

508
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,940
Guard enters the building.

509
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,460
Keep waiting.

510
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,699
You keep waiting.

511
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:04,739
A small moth child.

512
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:09,829
I'm getting lapped again.

513
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:12,980
Waiting again.

514
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:18,059
Rat faced orc.

515
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:19,300
You wait a little longer.

516
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,500
A large dwarf enters the building.

517
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,019
OK, push to the front.

518
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:30,699
I have to do one more cycle of this.

519
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,780
Seventy seven percent of you said to wait.

520
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:44,719
That's a lot of people that said wait.

521
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,800
I'm going to click wait

522
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,849
ten more times than I'm pushing to the front.

523
00:40:49,849 --> 00:41:03,710
Two, three, four, five, six, seven.

524
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,789
It's definitely I've definitely

525
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,030
to push in front of somebody specific.

526
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,110
And I don't know who.

527
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,829
Should I push in front of my hobgoblin friend

528
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,170
that I just made?

529
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:24,599
Who should I push to the front in front of?

530
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,599
Leave the line, Gigachad.

531
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:35,659
After all that, you don't even ride the ride.

532
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,099
I just get in line at Disney World.

533
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,659
Wait till I'm about to get called

534
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:43,420
to go into the cart and leave.

535
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,769
I'm just pushing to the front.

536
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,329
There's definitely a rhyme to this.

537
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,929
There's definitely I've had this.

538
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:06,469
I have to do this somehow.

539
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:12,909
I don't know who I'm cutting in front of, though.

540
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:14,230
Cut in front of the moth child

541
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,219
is what people are saying.

542
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:19,969
OK, you slip out of the line again,

543
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,210
which closes up behind you immediately

544
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,250
and you walk towards the door of the building.

545
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:27,019
A rat faced orc stops you.

546
00:42:30,269 --> 00:42:36,980
What do you think you're doing?

547
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,349
Get out of my way.

548
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,429
I heard the teller's name is wide.

549
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:48,309
I want to see if it's worth waiting for.

550
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:49,539
I don't know.

551
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:51,659
I wouldn't want to pick a rat faced orc.

552
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:59,539
I want to see if it's worth waiting for.

553
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:01,469
Oh, it's worth it.

554
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,110
This is my 13th time.

555
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:16,480
But how come I can't get in?

556
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,750
I've been passed ten times.

557
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:23,869
You know, I heard the teller's name is wide.

558
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,599
Is that right?

559
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,429
So what?

560
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:34,150
Come in there.

561
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,949
All right, I'll get back.

562
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:37,309
I'm going to rejoin the line.

563
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:39,230
We get back in line.

564
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,539
You wait.

565
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:45,260
Now a rat faced orc is next.

566
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,980
No, I'm going to.

567
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,619
OK, I know what I'm doing.

568
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,980
I'm going to cut every single person

569
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,260
till we get the right one.

570
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,469
OK, here we go.

571
00:43:52,469 --> 00:44:05,429
Wait. Oh, did I actually miss the opportunity?

572
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,849
I can't push now.

573
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,070
Really?

574
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,309
Do I actually get to do

575
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:22,320
the whole thing screwed up now?

576
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:41,659
All right. Ten more clicks and I'm done.

577
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,210
Wait. Talk to the thin creature.

578
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:50,059
You turn to the thin creature.

579
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:52,340
Didn't you just go in?

580
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,860
Yes. So why are you in line again?

581
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,389
Haven't you been inside yourself?

582
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:02,690
No. Oh, you'll understand

583
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,349
once you've been inside.

584
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:06,590
Wide explains it better than I could.

585
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,489
What did he tell you?

586
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:13,210
The thin creature shakes his head.

587
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,059
It's too personal to share.

588
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:18,460
Besides, without knowing the answers

589
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,619
to the previous questions,

590
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,599
you wouldn't understand, I think.

591
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,980
And what will you do with the answer?

592
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,639
Choose my next question.

593
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,440
I'm getting close to my true calling now.

594
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,940
I can feel it.

595
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,289
How many times you've been in there?

596
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:35,929
That was my 15th visit.

597
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:36,809
Every time the future

598
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,340
becomes a little clearer.

599
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,139
I see real potential now.

600
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:42,309
I could become almost anything.

601
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,110
I'm almost giddy with excitement.

602
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,789
But I'll have to wait, of course.

603
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:46,510
Please.

604
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:52,260
I need to contemplate my next question.

605
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,340
Why do I have to wait?

606
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
Why can't I go in?

607
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:02,460
Why are people just passing me?

608
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,650
God damn it.

609
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,170
You walk by the hawker

610
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,449
who is plying her trade to the crowd.

611
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,119
Shit.

612
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:17,880
Examine the one.

613
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,500
Examine the wonder stone of secrets.

614
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,340
Marvel as it speaks, advises,

615
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,630
and prophecies its sizes.

616
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,829
You approach the hawker

617
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:30,590
who points right at you.

618
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,510
Now here is a discerning patron

619
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,070
of the weird and wonderful.

620
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,110
Will he enter and experience the mysteries

621
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,869
that even our best magical knowledge

622
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:41,079
cannot explain?

623
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,949
You're a fraud.

624
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:45,309
The tone of the accusation

625
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:47,590
barely registers with the hawker.

626
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,190
Oh, friend, I commend you on your skepticism.

627
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,110
We should not believe the words of strangers.

628
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,750
We should judge with our own eyes.

629
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,070
And that is why, just for you,

630
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,989
I will allow an intelligent traveler

631
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:02,190
such as you to experience the stone

632
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,739
for only two gold pieces.

633
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:12,489
What is it?

634
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:14,940
She puffs herself up.

635
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,059
The stone of secrets

636
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,980
is an incredibly rare artifact

637
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,940
discovered deep within a lost cave

638
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,840
many moons ago.

639
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,480
It is the only stone in the world

640
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,920
which can speak.

641
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,320
It is not powered by magic,

642
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,000
but a strange alien force

643
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,210
unique to the old world.

644
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,809
The greatest magicians of our age

645
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:32,849
have examined it

646
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:38,579
and walked away confounded.

647
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:43,619
It's only two bucks.

648
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,380
Where are you from?

649
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,039
You ask.

650
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,889
I'm a proud daughter of the eighth slum,

651
00:47:49,889 --> 00:47:50,969
but they say my family

652
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,369
were once great travelers and traders

653
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:55,929
crossing the whole of the old world.

654
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:04,389
Can you imagine such a journey, Trelawney?

655
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:09,199
No, she nods.

656
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,079
Indeed, it is but a journey

657
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:12,679
beyond all imagining,

658
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:14,320
especially for one without,

659
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,239
if I might say,

660
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,760
the traveler's blood.

661
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,940
The tales my stone could tell you now.

662
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,699
Rubbing the stone.

663
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,639
I will pay.

664
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:29,400
You pay the fee and the hawker beams

665
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,679
her gaze already slipping past you.

666
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,000
Here is a brave soul

667
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,239
who has chosen to embrace

668
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:35,840
the mystery and wonder.

669
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,150
Who will follow him?

670
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,210
It's two bucks, whatever.

671
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,090
If I walk through here

672
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,690
and it was a jump scare,

673
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,769
I'd be like it was two gold.

674
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:48,699
I don't even care.

675
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:51,460
Inside the tent is a dim and cramped.

676
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,269
It's very like that.

677
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:54,349
A large stack of boxes

678
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:55,110
sits to one side,

679
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,989
a cloth draped over them.

680
00:48:56,989 --> 00:48:58,469
Other curiosities, no doubt,

681
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,909
that the hawker has shelved

682
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:04,219
in favor of the more profitable stone.

683
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:04,739
Sure, it's the box.

684
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:06,940
Let's just let's do it.

685
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,739
You begin to rifle through the boxes

686
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,820
when suddenly you are stopped short.

687
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,099
Then a voice booms through the tent.

688
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,300
I don't know who this is,

689
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,489
so it's going to be pretty generic.

690
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:20,460
Anor Londo.

691
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,739
A familiar voice.

692
00:49:22,739 --> 00:49:24,380
The voice is familiar,

693
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,860
but quite impossible.

694
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,059
It is the booming tone of Shadrach,

695
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:31,039
the hermit from the backlands.

696
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:33,179
This must be a trick.

697
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:35,349
Alas, no trick,

698
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,179
replies the voice happily.

699
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:38,980
A fairly poor outcome for me,

700
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,300
I'll warrant, but no trick.

701
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,079
Shadrach?

702
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:46,280
Yes, yes, it is I.

703
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,219
It is good to see you again.

704
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,239
After a fashion, at least.

705
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,980
What happened?

706
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,500
I bound a piece of my spirit to this rock.

707
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,730
A desperate move.

708
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,400
Why?

709
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,440
The Archmage's assassins found my cave.

710
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,960
I was staked outside on a cross.

711
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,130
My body is still there, wasting away.

712
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,090
I was able to project

713
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:14,440
a fragment of myself into this stone.

714
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,590
Another into a tree.

715
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,300
You will not last long in there.

716
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,460
True.

717
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,099
I only saved a small portion of my mind,

718
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:31,860
and the magic binding me to the stone is tenuous.

719
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,989
Can I aid you?

720
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,030
No.

721
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,650
It is best you put me out of your mind.

722
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:42,079
Your own task is all that matters.

723
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,579
Can you help me?

724
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,260
I only hope I can help.

725
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,960
I am but a rock.

726
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,000
The stone dulls in color a touch,

727
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,760
as though it sighed.

728
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,320
But all I have learned of Manpang

729
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,960
has made my heart heavier.

730
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,639
All right, we got to get some questions answered here.

731
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:11,820
Beat the Archmage to death with the soul rock.

732
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:17,659
Hey, make that happen.

733
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:18,869
Okay.

734
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:23,320
What secrets does Manpang hold, do you ask?

735
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,159
The greatest secret are the vaults of Manpang,

736
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:28,440
buried somewhere beneath the city.

737
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,320
They hold the treasure of the fortress,

738
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,800
but they are heavily guarded.

739
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,300
What do you know about these vaults?

740
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,380
The stone would shake its head

741
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,820
if it had a head to shake.

742
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,219
Nothing.

743
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,920
But the crown will not be in any vault.

744
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,969
It is too precious for that.

745
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:51,980
How do I reach the Archmage?

746
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,469
You must enter the Sorcerer's Spike.

747
00:51:55,469 --> 00:51:57,530
But its doors have never opened.

748
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,769
They were made by the necromancer Throbin,

749
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:02,730
locked in three ways and then sealed in a fourth.

750
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,849
The last seal was a bind that required he took his life.

751
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:08,769
But the only power that can defeat the crown

752
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:11,530
lies behind those doors.

753
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:16,400
The rock rattles and then falls still for a time.

754
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,650
I am sorry, Anor Lander.

755
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:24,340
Lack the strength to continue speaking.

756
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,219
My body has already failed and my spirit

757
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,510
cannot stay anchored to this rock forever.

758
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:44,579
Keep your wits about you and know that I am proud.

759
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:52,170
The rock stills as Shadrach's voice fades.

760
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,829
Shadrach, what the heck?

761
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:59,829
Master class actor.

762
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:08,019
Acting.

763
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,420
He does not care.

764
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,369
All he cares about is acting.

765
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:14,210
He doesn't even care.

766
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,050
He's not even sad.

767
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:19,199
He just wants to keep just acting.

768
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,119
To be fair, I did finish that and was like acting.

769
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:33,260
So I understand the criticism.

770
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,030
Can you act like you care?

771
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,139
Oh, all right.

772
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:39,059
Throw me a curve ball there.

773
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:40,519
Okay, yeah.

774
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:41,480
That's a tough one.

775
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,400
See if I can do that.

776
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,130
That's a hard role.

777
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,170
Well, that's quite a role.

778
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,969
I have to like care.

779
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:50,210
Okay, goodness.

780
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,820
That's gonna be hard.

781
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,059
Outside the tent, the Hawker claps you on the shoulder.

782
00:53:57,059 --> 00:53:59,900
Well, friend, did the stone unlock the mysteries

783
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,380
of the universe for you?

784
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,260
Did it dazzle your senses?

785
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,840
Delight your spirit?

786
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,400
Indeed, you're exploiting that creature.

787
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:16,300
But he's dead, so I don't know.

788
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,840
Do I just walk?

789
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,219
Walk away.

790
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:27,139
You walk away without a word.

791
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:28,619
All right, am I getting that weapon?

792
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:38,340
I think I have one more opportunity to get it.

793
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,260
You return to the stalls,

794
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,179
noisy with the sounds of aggressive haggling.

795
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,820
Nearby, a fight breaks out over the price of cloth,

796
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,349
but there's nothing more to be bought.

797
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:51,300
Is there anything else that I missed?

798
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,300
No opportunity to go this way.

799
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,590
Let me check.

800
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,429
There is not.

801
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:02,909
All right, so we have to go back to the square.

802
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:04,789
You head away from the maze of stalls and shops.

803
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:07,159
Which way now?

804
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:10,820
All right, we got another opportunity.

805
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,900
There is the west side,

806
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,659
which I'm imagining takes us through here.

807
00:55:16,659 --> 00:55:17,500
Down here.

808
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,730
I'll give you a bigger picture so you can see again.

809
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,340
Are we staying west?

810
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,059
There's also this here.

811
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:27,280
There's this here.

812
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,500
There's all this over on the eastern side.

813
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:36,510
And there's actually the fortress itself, which is here.

814
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,070
Are we gonna go?

815
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:41,420
I'm gonna make it pretty general.

816
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,380
I can run the poll too.

817
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,059
It's probably just way easier.

818
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:50,449
Because I'll just do it very, very quickly.

819
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:57,300
West, north, or east?

820
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:06,199
Where do you wanna go?

821
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,639
Yeah, for more complicated polls

822
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,000
that require a sentence or so for each answer,

823
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,090
or at least a few words, then yeah.

824
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:15,010
But in like the 10 seconds of stream delay

825
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,210
it takes to communicate it,

826
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:31,239
I think it's easy for me just to write it.

827
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:43,139
It's kind of, could go either way.

828
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:44,420
He's on the road to retirement

829
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,130
and he learned how to do polls.

830
00:56:48,130 --> 00:57:05,340
I've also been very on time since talking about that.

831
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:16,619
Good job, peepaw.

832
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,909
All right, we're going west.

833
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:23,989
We're gonna stay on this side.

834
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:26,030
You hit him with the peepaw?

835
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,010
What?

836
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:34,400
What?

837
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,760
You hit the dude with peepaw?

838
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,510
You hit him with peepaw?

839
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,849
Is that bad?

840
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,179
All right, here we go.

841
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:47,179
An old beggar woman lounges against a well nearby,

842
00:57:47,179 --> 00:57:49,400
watching people come and go from the market.

843
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,719
A wider road leads west into a rundown area of the city.

844
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,900
Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.

845
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:02,260
The beggar, let's go to the beggar.

846
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,980
You walk over to the well where an old woman,

847
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,099
little more than a bundle of rags, sits.

848
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:10,630
She does not look at you as you approach.

849
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,340
Look at the woman.

850
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,179
Her face is obscured by a shapeless hood.

851
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:16,619
She rarely acknowledges anyone,

852
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,019
not even holding out her hand for alms.

853
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,699
Greet her.

854
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,710
Greetings, old woman.

855
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,300
You declare.

856
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,880
I think I remember this one.

857
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,139
I remember this.

858
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:45,519
This is a very old footage.

859
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:47,260
Those that know, they know.

860
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:52,380
She looks moldy.

861
00:58:52,380 --> 00:59:00,469
I think back in 2016, this clip was like,

862
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:02,510
I think the first time that a clip on the channel

863
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:05,989
really like, whoa, people watched it.

864
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:08,909
There's a lot of views on that clip.

865
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:10,230
I remember that was kind of like,

866
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:14,099
holy shit, there's a lot of views on this clip.

867
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:16,909
2016.

868
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:17,750
All right, but anyways,

869
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,809
we can be nostalgic all we want.

870
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,380
Let's continue.

871
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,300
He's reminiscing.

872
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,280
Her voice when she speaks is raspy, barely above a whisper.

873
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,039
And her eyes, when they meet yours,

874
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:36,300
are a smooth, glossy black.

875
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,469
There you are, my love.

876
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:42,269
Found you now.

877
00:59:42,269 --> 00:59:45,949
Spare an old blind woman a coin,

878
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:51,599
left by a crust of bread, perhaps.

879
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,119
Here, you can have a coin.

880
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,119
You toss a gold coin into her lap

881
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,829
and she rocks back and forth, grinning.

882
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:05,260
You have made Javine a happier woman.

883
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,780
Bless you for helping me live out my last days.

884
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:17,550
Now, love, anything else for an old blind woman?

885
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,699
Who are you?

886
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:24,960
Well, now, my love, most call me Hergifilia.

887
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,619
But you can call me Javine.

888
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:31,400
It is my prettier name.

889
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,130
And now you are a beggar.

890
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:39,880
I was a healer before, but now, yes, now I beg.

891
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,980
I sit here every day with little to pass the time,

892
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,789
tormenting I receive from the Sightmasters.

893
01:00:47,789 --> 01:00:50,429
Sightmasters here in Mang-Pang Shirley,

894
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:54,309
she must be mistaken.

895
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:58,570
There can be no Sightmasters here, you assure her.

896
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,289
Know about them, do you?

897
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:04,010
Next you'll be.

898
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:09,329
Tell me you're the Anor Lander you are.

899
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:11,110
I am.

900
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:17,510
And fresh-faced young beauty am I.

901
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:23,010
Little Sightmasters, they're like a pox on me.

902
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:27,300
One lacking sight is a source of much curiosity to them.

903
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,860
Half of them want to kill me

904
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,039
and half of them are in love with me.

905
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:37,230
And those halves aren't entirely separate halves.

906
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:42,059
The ones from my homeland were honorable.

907
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:49,780
These may be the outcasts then, it is hard to say.

908
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,369
What happened to your eyes?

909
01:01:52,369 --> 01:01:55,900
Well, you don't waste time with pleasantries, do you?

910
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,059
But I'll tell you my tale.

911
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:01,980
I was called on by the Archmage himself

912
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,219
to examine one of his creation.

913
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:07,929
The Archmage makes creatures, you see,

914
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:10,539
of all mixtures and kinds.

915
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:12,659
This one was a mucousy, slimy sort of a thing

916
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:17,429
called a mu-galactic, if I remember.

917
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:20,340
A miserable thing born totally without fear.

918
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:26,760
They're almost deaf and speak only in whisper.

919
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,900
Why does the Archmage make such creatures?

920
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,789
Why does the Archmage do anything?

921
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,190
Why does he sleep for a hundred years

922
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:37,659
and wake up to measure the positions of the stars?

923
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:39,059
If I knew the workings of his mind,

924
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:41,780
I would have twisted them to my own end years ago,

925
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,840
but I don't.

926
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,679
Oh.

927
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,619
Ew.

928
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:52,329
What a lovely chat.

929
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:55,639
I so rarely get to talk these days, love.

930
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,309
Come back anytime,

931
01:02:57,309 --> 01:03:00,670
especially if you slay one of the Sightmasters.

932
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,559
Like this.

933
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:08,409
I have killed a Sightmaster, you lie.

934
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:13,860
You're a silver-tongued one, aren't you?

935
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,980
Know all the right things to say, but it's no good.

936
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,809
I'm not stupid.

937
01:03:18,809 --> 01:03:21,489
I got sight.

938
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:23,489
You leave the woman huddled by the wall.

939
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:29,860
Why would you lie?

940
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,190
I don't know.

941
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:37,710
Didn't I?

942
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,550
Oh, one died.

943
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:39,389
No, no, no.

944
01:03:39,389 --> 01:03:42,539
One died in front of me.

945
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:47,780
That doesn't count.

946
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,969
She saw through your lie.

947
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:53,460
Why are you taking credit for that?

948
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,699
Well, I don't want to take credit for it.

949
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:58,360
I just, I don't know.

950
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,010
You've returned to the west side of the square.

951
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:03,860
Jovine appears to go back to sleep.

952
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,030
A wider road leads west into a rundown area of the city.

953
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:09,230
The sun is almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.

954
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:13,050
It'll be night soon.

955
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:18,380
All right, we're going this way.

956
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,659
You walk west out of the square following a wide road.

957
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:24,119
It passes by a larger gate.

958
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:25,519
Another night begins.

959
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:26,679
You should try to find a place to sleep,

960
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:28,690
especially on an empty stomach.

961
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,170
Before you is a stone facade

962
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,969
that stretches the length of the street.

963
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,929
It seems to be closed for the night.

964
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:37,599
Oh, it's nighttime.

965
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,980
Arched windows are placed evenly,

966
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,460
though several panes are missing.

967
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:44,579
Worn steps lead to a door that is rather small

968
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:46,329
for such a large building.

969
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:51,489
The doors are sealed fast for the night.

970
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:59,019
Um, should I just sleep out here?

971
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:01,929
You should just read a book at this point.

972
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:04,440
I think that is exactly what we're doing.

973
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,519
Sorcery is a book.

974
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:11,340
It has been, its pages have been ported to a digital,

975
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,940
but it's a digital book.

976
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:19,059
It's what we're doing.

977
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:20,860
You spent so much time waiting in line.

978
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:28,909
Uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep going.

979
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:35,699
I feel like that's not a safe place to go.

980
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:38,099
The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall,

981
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:40,570
eventually reaching a low metal door.

982
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:45,420
The moon moves slowly across the dark sky.

983
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,000
All right, we got a door.

984
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,639
The door is made of thin strips of metal riveted together

985
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:52,340
with a few gaps and holes between the plates.

986
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,260
Peering through the holes,

987
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,059
you make out a sea of waving grass stalks,

988
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:59,710
tall and clearly half wild.

989
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,300
Going.

990
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,820
You push at the door and are surprised to find

991
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,019
it is not locked.

992
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:06,340
It is, however, heavy enough that it swings shut

993
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:07,829
when you release it.

994
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:10,349
You had better sleep when you can find somewhere safe.

995
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:13,989
Next.

996
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:17,420
Oh shit, wait, that was for this.

997
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:26,380
I don't think we sleep in a field.

998
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,019
Remember, unironically, you're the type of person

999
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:29,500
to close your eyes while shooting a gun

1000
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:38,170
so the noise doesn't hurt your ears.

1001
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:40,130
You don't know, you don't know anything about me.

1002
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:43,059
Come on, dude.

1003
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:47,030
Well, how do you, why would you even,

1004
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:53,139
how do you even know that?

1005
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:56,119
That was a deep cut.

1006
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,289
You don't like the sound of tape, that's how we know.

1007
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:06,690
All right, me not enjoying this.

1008
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,619
We're going in the field.

1009
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:13,389
That touched a nerve.

1010
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:15,190
Yeah, cause you know why?

1011
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:17,360
Cause I don't have a rebuttal,

1012
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,199
but you all know that I have one.

1013
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:20,900
I just can't give one.

1014
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,739
I can't give a rebuttal.

1015
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:25,550
Cause like, how do I prove that?

1016
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,050
I could tell you it's not true.

1017
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,329
How do I prove that?

1018
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:31,849
Me acknowledging that person's criticism

1019
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:37,139
means I have to, how do I prove that person wrong?

1020
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:43,190
It's a no win scenario for me.

1021
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,630
I have to dodge the ax.

1022
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:47,889
I do.

1023
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:48,929
I got to dodge that ax.

1024
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:58,360
I have to go to a shooting range,

1025
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,400
but to prove that I don't close my eyes

1026
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,039
when firing a firearm,

1027
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,730
that's that important to you all.

1028
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,869
That is this important.

1029
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:11,179
I have to prove it.

1030
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:12,420
I don't want to do that.

1031
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:22,020
I don't want to go to like a shooting range.

1032
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,350
All right, I'll write it down.

1033
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,510
Just because I wrote it down

1034
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,750
doesn't mean I'm going to do it.

1035
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,329
It just means I'm going to think about it.

1036
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:30,609
I'm just going to write it down.

1037
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:31,890
It's never happening,

1038
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,689
but just know that it's made it past the barrier

1039
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:42,949
of I wrote it down.

1040
01:08:42,949 --> 01:08:43,789
Okay.

1041
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:50,649
You slip under the archway into a wide field of wheatgrass.

1042
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:53,630
Each stalk is taller than you stand.

1043
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,829
The heavy door slams shut behind you.

1044
01:08:55,829 --> 01:08:58,859
That's not good.

1045
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:00,260
You look over the door.

1046
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,340
It is solid, but seems in good repair,

1047
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,800
as though used fairly frequently.

1048
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:14,739
It does not appear to be locked.

1049
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:20,420
I'm just going to move through the grass.

1050
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:31,289
Inevitably, I want to be here.

1051
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:33,170
You walk on through the long grass.

1052
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:36,380
Then something large slithers over your foot.

1053
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:40,300
Hopping back, you see a large snake disappear into the wheat.

1054
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:41,960
No, back away.

1055
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,319
You back away from the snake.

1056
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,800
The stalks close around you.

1057
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,409
Where did it go?

1058
01:09:49,409 --> 01:09:54,069
I can make it.

1059
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:56,189
Why did you emphasize large so heavily?

1060
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:58,229
Because it was in, it was like bolded.

1061
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:06,470
It was like in a italics.

1062
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,949
You stride onwards through the field of wheat.

1063
01:10:07,949 --> 01:10:09,390
The spire stands in front of you,

1064
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:11,739
as high as an ancient tree.

1065
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,020
But impossibly thin.

1066
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,949
How can it stay upright?

1067
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:19,250
At the base is an opening just large enough to enter.

1068
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,090
Look up?

1069
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,680
Let's see.

1070
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,720
The spire is built from tiny stacked stones

1071
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,020
into a low pointed tower.

1072
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,220
It is clearly old and somewhat poorly maintained.

1073
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,699
There's a low door at its base,

1074
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:34,649
though it hardly seems large enough for a person to enter.

1075
01:10:34,649 --> 01:10:36,489
You could venture inside the dim space

1076
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:37,890
within the narrow spire.

1077
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:43,270
It should provide a safe place to sleep.

1078
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:47,420
Okay.

1079
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,880
Well, we're going in.

1080
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,279
Weak moonlight filters in from above,

1081
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:55,520
but the ceiling is shrouded from view.

1082
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,640
There is no floor,

1083
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,079
but the grass underfoot is pale and short.

1084
01:10:59,079 --> 01:11:01,159
At the center of the room is a small shrine,

1085
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:07,500
a cut stump of wood on which stands a tiny clay idol.

1086
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,340
I'm gonna pick this up and I'm gonna get smushed.

1087
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,699
Search the space.

1088
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:16,100
You investigate around the shrine,

1089
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,739
but find nothing except a rotten ladder bolted to one wall.

1090
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:24,329
Most of its rungs missing.

1091
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:26,659
Uh, what about the shrine?

1092
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:29,140
You approach the shrine, a hefty tree stump.

1093
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:32,550
It has been carried here and carefully cut and sanded.

1094
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,430
The idol on top is unpainted clay.

1095
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,310
Pray at the shrine.

1096
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:42,220
Ooh, what's the idol?

1097
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:45,659
The idol is small enough that you need to squat to see it.

1098
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,579
It is roughly made with pits and defects.

1099
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:49,899
It is human shaped,

1100
01:11:49,899 --> 01:11:52,739
clutching a sword that points towards the ground.

1101
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:56,619
It lacks a face and is unnaturally cold to the touch,

1102
01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:01,329
as though it drank your warmth.

1103
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:10,409
Uh, uh, it's either pray and get a new god,

1104
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:18,699
or maybe this is not a good thing.

1105
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:30,619
Uh, pray, leave, alone, destroy.

1106
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:33,470
Which one?

1107
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:43,250
Cause I really don't, I really don't know.

1108
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:55,390
Is it gonna be that god of gods asshole again?

1109
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:59,579
This sounds like an evil god.

1110
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:09,130
I don't remember, so.

1111
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,270
What gods are left?

1112
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:20,539
Um, I think there's a few here in the fourth game.

1113
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:23,039
All right, well it's gonna be pray.

1114
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:27,420
All right, pray at the shrine, let's go.

1115
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:29,680
You kneel down to pray at the shrine.

1116
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:34,109
Your mind empties and you hear whispering from far below.

1117
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:37,430
The earth shifts slightly as the empty heavens recoils

1118
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,140
from the presence in the narrow room.

1119
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:45,180
Words are coming unbidden to your mind.

1120
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,369
Whisper the words.

1121
01:13:47,369 --> 01:13:48,810
You murmur the words in your mind

1122
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:51,010
and they grow thicker and faster,

1123
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,619
turning from trickle, torrent.

1124
01:13:54,619 --> 01:13:57,340
There are prayers for suffering, for safety,

1125
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,979
for rain and sun and dry lands.

1126
01:13:59,979 --> 01:14:01,659
There are words for a ruined world

1127
01:14:01,659 --> 01:14:04,420
and the words for a breaking bud.

1128
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:07,260
There are tumbling seasons and birds in flight

1129
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,550
and stars in the sky.

1130
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:12,590
The spire in which you stand seems to extend in height

1131
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,890
as though its tip touched the sky

1132
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:20,090
and its base lay at the center of the world.

1133
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,630
Keep going.

1134
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,470
You murmur onwards,

1135
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:26,909
but despite the extent of the space

1136
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:29,140
your prayers have created,

1137
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,029
no voice enters it.

1138
01:14:31,029 --> 01:14:32,310
No voice replies.

1139
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,500
This place is empty.

1140
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:38,699
Your words dry up, spent, as the earth shifts again.

1141
01:14:38,699 --> 01:14:40,500
The spire is once more silent.

1142
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,550
In this place, there is nothing, only silence.

1143
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:46,899
Your maximum stamina has increased.

1144
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:50,180
24.

1145
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:53,420
Now we go to sleep.

1146
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,979
This place seems safe enough.

1147
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:58,029
You lie down and gratefully close your eyes,

1148
01:14:58,029 --> 01:15:00,859
but your sleep is not without interruption.

1149
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:03,899
In the dead of night, you are stirred by a bright light

1150
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:11,199
playing over your eyes.

1151
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,229
Look.

1152
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:14,510
You lift your eyelids a crack

1153
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,590
to see a brilliant bright glow

1154
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,710
radiating from the idol on the altar.

1155
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,270
It pulses like a breath.

1156
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,069
Your breath clouds in front of your face.

1157
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:30,380
When did it become so cold?

1158
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:41,840
I feel like we keep watching.

1159
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,050
You watch, and a worshiper arrives.

1160
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,890
A hunched figure scuttles into the chamber

1161
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,930
to crouch before the idol.

1162
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,010
They have not noticed you,

1163
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,159
or else you are unimportant to them.

1164
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,439
They're whispering to the idol,

1165
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:58,189
voice soft and pleading.

1166
01:15:58,189 --> 01:16:00,949
Excuse me!

1167
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:07,300
Uh, I think I'm just gonna lie still.

1168
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,399
You wait, regulating your breathing to appear asleep.

1169
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,319
The figure continues to whisper at the idol,

1170
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,630
their words becoming increasingly frantic.

1171
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,229
They stop mid-sentence, holding back a sob.

1172
01:16:19,229 --> 01:16:20,550
After a long pause,

1173
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,390
they turn away from the altar,

1174
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:27,119
struggling to their feet.

1175
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:29,260
Greet the figure.

1176
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,659
You open your eyes as the figure passes

1177
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:34,979
the end of where you lie.

1178
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:36,619
Greetings.

1179
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:38,220
The figure gasps.

1180
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,640
Annalender, you are awake?

1181
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,020
Uh, shing!

1182
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,699
That's not me.

1183
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:51,340
You know me?

1184
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,699
Do you know me?

1185
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,460
You ask, your voice is calm

1186
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,989
in the gentle darkness of the spire.

1187
01:16:56,989 --> 01:17:00,210
The figure chokes a sob.

1188
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:01,970
I've always loved you.

1189
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:05,550
How could I not recognize you now?

1190
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:06,989
Does the figure lie?

1191
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,670
You cannot see the eyes below the cowl,

1192
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,229
but if you could,

1193
01:17:11,229 --> 01:17:18,510
they would be sobbing.

1194
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,989
Uh, what trick is this?

1195
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:23,369
You ask suspiciously.

1196
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:25,699
The figure shakes its head.

1197
01:17:25,699 --> 01:17:27,119
No trick.

1198
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:29,119
I cannot control my heart.

1199
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,460
I was made to love you.

1200
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:37,079
Come over here where I can see you.

1201
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:40,520
I yearn for you, the creature replies plaintively,

1202
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,220
but I love you too much to do what I was made to do.

1203
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:45,579
A single tear catches the light

1204
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:52,100
as it rolls down the figure's cheek.

1205
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,979
Why are you crying?

1206
01:17:52,979 --> 01:17:55,609
Like, who are you?

1207
01:17:55,609 --> 01:17:59,649
Oh, Annalander, I prayed for a vision of you,

1208
01:17:59,649 --> 01:18:01,920
but what I was told...

1209
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,979
Oh, tell me.

1210
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,779
You will die here in Mampang.

1211
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:14,979
Oh, oh, it's awful.

1212
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:17,819
Before you ever reach the great doors of Throbin,

1213
01:18:17,819 --> 01:18:20,430
you will die.

1214
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,640
Get out while you can.

1215
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,520
The figure...

1216
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,840
Why does this turn into Dawn Nots?

1217
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,300
The figure is shaking its head sadly.

1218
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,859
Oh, you will die over and over and over again.

1219
01:18:32,859 --> 01:18:35,619
With that, the figure rushes out into the night,

1220
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:40,260
sobbing and wailing as though their heart were breaking.

1221
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,619
The remainder of the night passes in uneasy sleep.

1222
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:49,729
You sleep and you do not dream.

1223
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:51,449
Who is this person?

1224
01:18:51,449 --> 01:19:00,479
Who the fuck was this person?

1225
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:02,000
You gained some max stamina,

1226
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,199
lost some gold, and searched the wheat fields,

1227
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,279
and you spoke to Shadrach's stone.

1228
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:11,220
The Archmage is unaware of you still.

1229
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:14,229
That was not Flanker, though.

1230
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:15,109
You hurry to your feet.

1231
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,909
Let's get on top of the ladder.

1232
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:18,869
You attempt to scale the ladder,

1233
01:19:18,869 --> 01:19:20,590
but there are too few handholds,

1234
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,359
and the ladder is far too old to be of any use.

1235
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,329
Even if there was anything worth climbing up to,

1236
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:27,949
you leave the spire.

1237
01:19:27,949 --> 01:19:31,960
The sun breaks over the eastern wall.

1238
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:45,119
I wonder how differently that can play out.

1239
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:46,439
Well, I'm gonna go this way.

1240
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,220
I'm curious about this.

1241
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,340
You pace on through the tall, swaying stems.

1242
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:55,199
Stalks break and crack around you as you walk.

1243
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,750
What are your thoughts on banana bread?

1244
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,899
Beautiful.

1245
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:03,100
Wonderful.

1246
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,979
It's fantastic.

1247
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:12,619
I think it's great.

1248
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:15,569
I don't like bananas, but I like banana bread.

1249
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:19,010
It's so funny because a regular banana,

1250
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,949
I would put on like B or C tier,

1251
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:27,619
but everything made with banana is S.

1252
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:29,829
Banana bread, S.

1253
01:20:29,829 --> 01:20:32,430
Banana pudding, banana cream pie, S.

1254
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,340
S.

1255
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,960
Regular banana the fruit?

1256
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,960
It's a B or an A.

1257
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,000
It's a B.

1258
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,880
But I love all the things you make with banana

1259
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,800
more than the actual fruit.

1260
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,680
Banana muffins.

1261
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,550
Oh yeah.

1262
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,859
That's S tier.

1263
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:53,260
It's A at least.

1264
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,899
Where did I put it when I did the fruit tier list

1265
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:57,760
like three years ago?

1266
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,840
I think I put it pretty high.

1267
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:06,220
I think it was like A or S.

1268
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:11,289
It was C.

1269
01:21:11,289 --> 01:21:14,079
Bananas that are about to turn brown are S tier.

1270
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:15,350
Oh yeah.

1271
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:20,220
A ripe banana is the best thing to put in a smoothie.

1272
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,229
Okay, let's keep going.

1273
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:25,189
All right, the grass here is strewn with rubble and rocks,

1274
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:26,899
which make the going difficult.

1275
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,779
The blocks have fallen from the outer wall

1276
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:31,930
and a sheer drop beckons to the west.

1277
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,960
Search the stones.

1278
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,779
You search through and around the stones.

1279
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:39,979
Eventually you come across something,

1280
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:43,579
a human arm bone underneath one large block.

1281
01:21:43,579 --> 01:21:44,979
Presumably this is unfortunate.

1282
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:49,199
It was standing below the wall when it fell.

1283
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,819
Uh, move back from the edge.

1284
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:56,600
I'm not messing with that.

1285
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:02,010
I guess I could jump off.

1286
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:07,229
You walk on through the field of wheat.

1287
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:10,810
Um, is anything out here?

1288
01:22:10,810 --> 01:22:11,850
I'm gonna check.

1289
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:14,619
I feel like there probably is.

1290
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:17,060
You stride onwards through the tall swaying stems.

1291
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,510
Then suddenly you stop.

1292
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:24,859
You have seen a prone form lying in the grass up ahead.

1293
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:28,829
Somebody's proning, looking at me.

1294
01:22:28,829 --> 01:22:30,270
Have you ever had an unripe avocado?

1295
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:35,020
Yeah, yeah, it's always a painful experience

1296
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,659
when you're like, is it ready?

1297
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:44,619
You open it, fuck, it's not.

1298
01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:54,180
Oh, I'm gonna read this thing's mind.

1299
01:22:54,180 --> 01:23:00,600
You gotta become an avocado whisperer.

1300
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,090
It's not ready.

1301
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:08,640
That's funny, if I pick an avocado, it's awful.

1302
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,779
Holly picks an avocado, it's great.

1303
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:13,779
I can't do it.

1304
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:22,840
I can't do it, every time I've tried.

1305
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:27,859
Avocado salsa tastes like radioactive waste.

1306
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,319
No, it does not.

1307
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:35,329
What do you, no, what?

1308
01:23:35,329 --> 01:23:37,090
I'm seeing a lot of trues right now,

1309
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,939
and I have to disagree.

1310
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:42,899
Wait, what do you mean, avocado salsa?

1311
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:44,729
You mean guacamole.

1312
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:46,729
Talking about guacamole, you mean like salsa that's,

1313
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:51,140
what do you mean?

1314
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,859
Guacamole's great.

1315
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:54,819
I, you know what, I didn't really like guacamole

1316
01:23:54,819 --> 01:23:59,510
until like five years ago.

1317
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:03,439
I like a chunky guacamole.

1318
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:06,340
I don't like smooth guacamole, it's too pasty.

1319
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,909
But big, chunky avocados in the guac,

1320
01:24:10,909 --> 01:24:11,789
that's where you got me.

1321
01:24:11,829 --> 01:24:17,029
Now I'm there, I'm excited.

1322
01:24:17,029 --> 01:24:18,909
What would you name your first child?

1323
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:20,699
Bill.

1324
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:23,550
Okay, you weave the spell pulling on the cloth, let's see.

1325
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,710
Thoughts rise up from the sleeping figure.

1326
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,550
It is dreaming of scratching its nose.

1327
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:33,020
Okay, this is, person's asleep.

1328
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,779
Poor kid, what's wrong with Bill?

1329
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,060
You got a problem with Bill?

1330
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:40,020
You got a problem with Bill, the name Bill?

1331
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:43,050
How many Bills in here just got fucking pissed at you?

1332
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,649
How many Williams are here right now

1333
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:47,409
that are like, excuse me?

1334
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:49,250
Why are they truing this?

1335
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:59,529
Yeah, what the hell's going on here?

1336
01:25:03,539 --> 01:25:04,899
Bill is an epic name.

1337
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,850
Yeah, thanks.

1338
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:11,449
Okay, we're not gonna talk about food.

1339
01:25:11,449 --> 01:25:12,930
We're not gonna talk about Bill.

1340
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,500
We're not gonna talk about Bill or food.

1341
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:24,060
We're gonna play sorcery, okay?

1342
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:34,369
You have another kid gonna be Ted, Bill and Ted.

1343
01:25:34,369 --> 01:25:36,010
Can I write it now?

1344
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:39,460
Can I write it?

1345
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:43,199
Okay, that's my reaction.

1346
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:44,039
You know what I mean?

1347
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,550
Like that's my, you guys do it, I'm gonna do it now.

1348
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:51,930
Okay, let's go.

1349
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:54,170
Okay, you weave the spell, okay, sleeping.

1350
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,020
Let's keep listening.

1351
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:59,010
You keep listening, the dream intensifies.

1352
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:01,890
It is now cleaning the inside of its ear

1353
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:05,050
and gently stroking across the top of its head.

1354
01:26:05,050 --> 01:26:12,340
Both actions are giving the creature ecstatic pleasure.

1355
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,340
You remove the skull cap, feeling somewhat sullied

1356
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,500
and the spell fades.

1357
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,460
What is going on?

1358
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,390
Okay.

1359
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:26,789
The figure is a strange creature

1360
01:26:26,789 --> 01:26:29,270
with long flat bladed arms.

1361
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:30,949
A little like the curious farmers you saw

1362
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:32,779
in the fields of Lowakari.

1363
01:26:32,779 --> 01:26:34,579
The figure is fast asleep,

1364
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:37,779
an empty wine skin by its side.

1365
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:38,739
Should I go up and wake the figure?

1366
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:40,130
I'm waking him up.

1367
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,529
You shake the figure on the shoulder

1368
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,890
until it opens its eyes.

1369
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:47,039
Instead of yawning, it lets out a series of small chirps.

1370
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:48,880
You're right.

1371
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:51,600
I should probably get back to work.

1372
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,039
Was that a bird or an ape?

1373
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:56,760
Who knows?

1374
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,579
You look over the creature and it stares back at you.

1375
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:03,340
Large teeth barred in what might be a smile.

1376
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,800
Its eyes are glossy like an insect's

1377
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:11,779
and you see a harsh reflection of yourself in them.

1378
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:13,699
Who are you?

1379
01:27:13,699 --> 01:27:16,949
What an odd question.

1380
01:27:16,949 --> 01:27:19,010
I'm me.

1381
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:21,369
As you speak, the creature idly shaves off

1382
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:24,739
some grass with a blade.

1383
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,279
Where are you from?

1384
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,899
Are you natural?

1385
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:29,819
Do you live in this field?

1386
01:27:29,819 --> 01:27:32,199
You live here.

1387
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:34,399
I usually sleep here,

1388
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:36,560
but sometimes I sleep closer to the market

1389
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,949
where I get some food.

1390
01:27:39,949 --> 01:27:41,550
Are you given a wage?

1391
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:43,439
You ask puzzled.

1392
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:47,449
A woman gives me apples and water in exchange for my wheat.

1393
01:27:47,449 --> 01:27:51,460
This conversation is oddly like talking to a plant.

1394
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:56,930
Are you from here?

1395
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:01,520
I have always lived in this field.

1396
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,560
What a coincidence.

1397
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,680
Me too.

1398
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,479
The creature beams up and sits up.

1399
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:07,479
Oh, it's so nice to sit with a human.

1400
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:10,760
Most avoid the fields or spit at me and call me a name.

1401
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,079
Now, what is it?

1402
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:14,899
What is it?

1403
01:28:14,899 --> 01:28:18,750
Freak, mutant, friend.

1404
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,600
Friend?

1405
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,510
Friend.

1406
01:28:22,510 --> 01:28:25,069
I've never heard that word before.

1407
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:32,149
And he picks his nose with the blade tip.

1408
01:28:32,149 --> 01:28:34,560
I think the Archmage made you.

1409
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,449
Perhaps it is a jest.

1410
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:38,890
Has the Archmage been selling your type to Kare?

1411
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:42,970
We'll go to the middle.

1412
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:45,989
Perhaps it is a jest.

1413
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:48,069
They usually don't stay around long enough

1414
01:28:48,069 --> 01:28:49,029
for me to find out,

1415
01:28:49,029 --> 01:28:51,859
but they are laughing as they say it.

1416
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:54,550
The creature bows its head to you.

1417
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:59,029
Not every day I get to spend time with a human.

1418
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:00,909
Few come by here and most ignore me.

1419
01:29:02,189 --> 01:29:11,939
Perhaps, could we play a game of swindle stones or a drink?

1420
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:17,189
How about a drink?

1421
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:23,229
Swindle stones?

1422
01:29:23,229 --> 01:29:28,199
It's been a while since we played swindle stones.

1423
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:34,220
The farmer counts out four dice each and takes first bid.

1424
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,060
Okay.

1425
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:41,140
So four each.

1426
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:41,979
Okay.

1427
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:44,180
I got to remember everything about this game.

1428
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:45,060
Where do you live?

1429
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,800
Near the market?

1430
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,640
Okay.

1431
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,979
So I have to, I'm going to say use one.

1432
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:51,949
That means you have one.

1433
01:29:51,949 --> 01:29:52,789
Okay.

1434
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:54,930
Then let's go with three ones.

1435
01:29:54,930 --> 01:30:00,619
No.

1436
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:02,739
If he calls that, it's going to be real.

1437
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:06,199
Should I say four ones?

1438
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:08,039
There are four, four ones.

1439
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:10,560
What do you think about that?

1440
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,399
Call it.

1441
01:30:11,399 --> 01:30:12,239
Good.

1442
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,420
You have one.

1443
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,260
Call it.

1444
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:19,829
You didn't even have, what?

1445
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:31,170
You had three twos and he's calling out ones.

1446
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:33,050
How is he rolling the dice?

1447
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:33,890
A good question.

1448
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,479
Okay.

1449
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:44,590
There is, there are two twos.

1450
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:48,020
There are three ones?

1451
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,859
Shit.

1452
01:30:48,859 --> 01:30:54,939
That might be accurate.

1453
01:30:54,939 --> 01:31:05,510
Do I dare say four?

1454
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,350
Should I say three?

1455
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:07,750
No.

1456
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:18,500
I think he's got me again.

1457
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,340
He got me again.

1458
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,180
I'm rusty.

1459
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:29,670
I haven't played in like a year.

1460
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:31,220
Two twos.

1461
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,060
Fuck.

1462
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:32,899
How, okay.

1463
01:31:32,899 --> 01:31:33,739
Can he see?

1464
01:31:33,739 --> 01:31:34,579
How can he see mine?

1465
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:39,369
That's, he keeps getting the ones that I have.

1466
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:41,180
What about two fives?

1467
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:46,670
Or two fours?

1468
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:47,510
All right.

1469
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,529
If you have one five that I get it.

1470
01:31:49,529 --> 01:31:50,369
I mean, one four.

1471
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:52,840
What?

1472
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:55,279
How do you not have one?

1473
01:31:55,279 --> 01:32:00,350
This, this guy's crazy at this game.

1474
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:04,260
I can't even rewind.

1475
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:05,859
I got screwed so bad.

1476
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:08,500
Me having three ones and him having three twos.

1477
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,340
And he says there are,

1478
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,779
he's calling out ones in the beginning.

1479
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:15,500
That fucked up the whole thing.

1480
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:16,340
I'm just going to make it up.

1481
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:22,699
I have one one, two twos.

1482
01:32:22,699 --> 01:32:23,539
Okay.

1483
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,239
You have to have those.

1484
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:27,039
So should I just call him?

1485
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:31,350
That means he has to have two twos.

1486
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:32,470
Do I dare tell?

1487
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:33,680
No.

1488
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,890
I have to call it.

1489
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:38,140
I have to.

1490
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:42,779
He's making this up or I mean, we lose anyways.

1491
01:32:42,779 --> 01:32:43,619
Yeah.

1492
01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:46,359
Call it out.

1493
01:32:46,359 --> 01:32:47,199
Of course.

1494
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,319
This guy's hands have been fucking disgusting, by the way.

1495
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:55,180
These are disgusting hands to get.

1496
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:59,319
Just absolutely disgusting hands.

1497
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:06,579
Let's play again.

1498
01:33:06,579 --> 01:33:07,420
Okay.

1499
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,699
That's a, this is good.

1500
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:09,539
There are two twos.

1501
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:10,380
Really?

1502
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,220
You think there are?

1503
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:14,699
I think there are three twos.

1504
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:15,710
Call it.

1505
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:25,989
Four twos.

1506
01:33:25,989 --> 01:33:27,149
Is he lying again?

1507
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:28,149
He's lying again.

1508
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:30,399
You don't have two.

1509
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:36,920
What the fuck?

1510
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:38,399
Yeah, but if I said five twos,

1511
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:41,739
he would call it and I would lose anyways.

1512
01:33:41,739 --> 01:33:49,100
Cause he knows.

1513
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:54,659
Let's go with two of these.

1514
01:33:54,659 --> 01:33:55,500
Just two.

1515
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:56,340
What about just two ones?

1516
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:57,180
Something I don't have.

1517
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:00,430
Two ones.

1518
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:04,369
Oh, is he cheating?

1519
01:34:04,369 --> 01:34:07,699
I think he's cheating.

1520
01:34:07,699 --> 01:34:16,949
This guy's cheating.

1521
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,180
He's cheating.

1522
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,020
He's gotten this.

1523
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:29,420
He's known what I've had in my hand every time.

1524
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:32,399
I'm going to say there are four of those

1525
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:34,159
because I don't know why you would say that

1526
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:37,319
if you didn't think you had at least two of them.

1527
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:40,899
Call it.

1528
01:34:40,899 --> 01:34:45,220
What the fuck?

1529
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:50,710
That means you have almost three fours are in your hand?

1530
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,359
No.

1531
01:34:55,359 --> 01:35:04,539
This game, he's cheating.

1532
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:05,380
See, look, he's got,

1533
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,300
how can he see what he knows what I have?

1534
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,140
All right.

1535
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:09,979
I'm going three.

1536
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:10,819
No, you know what?

1537
01:35:10,819 --> 01:35:12,590
Fuck you.

1538
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:15,760
Four twos.

1539
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,149
Oh, you think there are five twos?

1540
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:19,369
There are not.

1541
01:35:19,369 --> 01:35:23,010
Sorry.

1542
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:26,449
Here comes a comeback.

1543
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:27,289
You need to relax.

1544
01:35:27,289 --> 01:35:29,329
It's just a game.

1545
01:35:29,329 --> 01:35:30,409
Stick to talking about fruits.

1546
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:35,319
You're not very good at this.

1547
01:35:35,319 --> 01:35:36,359
Hey, I'm a little rusty.

1548
01:35:36,359 --> 01:35:37,899
I'm doing fine.

1549
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:38,739
All right, this is good.

1550
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:39,579
This is good.

1551
01:35:39,579 --> 01:35:40,659
This is huge.

1552
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:41,500
This is a huge deal.

1553
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:45,189
If I start out with two threes,

1554
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:46,949
okay, I'm going to say two threes.

1555
01:35:46,949 --> 01:35:47,989
That's going to ruin everything

1556
01:35:47,989 --> 01:36:02,779
because now he's going to say three threes.

1557
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:11,560
He's cheating.

1558
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,750
There are two ones because I have one of them.

1559
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:21,260
Hmm.

1560
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,859
This is fucked up.

1561
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:23,699
I'm sorry.

1562
01:36:23,699 --> 01:36:24,539
This is the best,

1563
01:36:24,539 --> 01:36:28,260
like the most ridiculous little stones I've ever played.

1564
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,619
This is actually cheating.

1565
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,159
Game over.

1566
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,279
The farmer shrugs.

1567
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:35,279
It is rather hard for me to roll, you see,

1568
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:36,560
but I do enjoy it.

1569
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:46,630
But another?

1570
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:54,750
How about one one?

1571
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:57,819
Two twos.

1572
01:36:57,819 --> 01:36:59,020
Three ones.

1573
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:01,260
Oh, you piece of shit.

1574
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,939
Okay, he probably has two.

1575
01:37:04,939 --> 01:37:07,819
I don't think I can call him on that.

1576
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:11,300
I'm going to say there are three threes.

1577
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,140
I have two.

1578
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,460
He just needs one.

1579
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:16,300
Reveal it.

1580
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:17,140
You definitely have one.

1581
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:33,000
Show your hand.

1582
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,810
Two threes.

1583
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:37,130
Three twos.

1584
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:38,529
He knows what I have.

1585
01:37:38,529 --> 01:37:39,369
He's cheating.

1586
01:37:39,369 --> 01:37:58,739
He's literally cheating.

1587
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,680
You bad at bluffing?

1588
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,920
This isn't a real guy.

1589
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,939
I can't bluff a fake person.

1590
01:38:06,939 --> 01:38:14,689
He's got computer knowledge in here of him cheating.

1591
01:38:14,689 --> 01:38:20,539
I'm just going to say something crazy.

1592
01:38:20,539 --> 01:38:22,100
I mean, I'm just going to call it

1593
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:25,380
because it's very high that he has two twos,

1594
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,000
but what am I going to do?

1595
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:27,840
Yeah.

1596
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:36,560
Got two twos and two ones.

1597
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,520
One.

1598
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:42,380
Okay.

1599
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:45,430
There are two of those.

1600
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:46,739
I'll say three.

1601
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:47,579
He's cheating.

1602
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:49,899
I've played this game a thousand times.

1603
01:38:49,899 --> 01:38:52,380
This guy's not, this is, he's cheating.

1604
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,380
Hey, watch this.

1605
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:54,220
Watch this.

1606
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:55,060
I'm going to, and he's going to be like,

1607
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,979
oh, by the way, thanks for showing me all those twos.

1608
01:38:57,979 --> 01:38:58,939
And I'm going to get the opportunity

1609
01:38:58,939 --> 01:39:01,020
to shoot a lightning bolt in his head.

1610
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,020
I'm just telling you what the game is going to do for us.

1611
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:09,100
It's going to, that's what's going to be presented to us.

1612
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:13,590
Oh, there are two ones.

1613
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,430
Two twos.

1614
01:39:15,229 --> 01:39:17,239
Get out of here with this shit.

1615
01:39:17,239 --> 01:39:23,250
Get out of here with this.

1616
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:25,479
I'm going to try it one more time.

1617
01:39:25,479 --> 01:39:26,319
Oh, I do love this.

1618
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:28,800
He's probably stealing shit from me while he cheats.

1619
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,039
I don't even care because I have to beat the cheater.

1620
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:34,630
I have to beat the cheater.

1621
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:35,470
Two twos.

1622
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,310
Yeah.

1623
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:40,560
I wonder why.

1624
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:41,399
You know what?

1625
01:39:41,399 --> 01:39:44,199
Let's go, let's just go with four twos.

1626
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:45,039
Four twos.

1627
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:46,310
What are you going to do about it?

1628
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:47,149
Okay.

1629
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:51,340
Well, you, you're a liar.

1630
01:39:51,340 --> 01:40:04,689
This motherfucker, I swear to God.

1631
01:40:04,689 --> 01:40:07,149
How about just one?

1632
01:40:07,149 --> 01:40:09,720
One.

1633
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,329
One five.

1634
01:40:11,329 --> 01:40:14,579
One four.

1635
01:40:14,579 --> 01:40:24,850
Two fours.

1636
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,289
Three threes.

1637
01:40:26,289 --> 01:40:28,079
You might have one.

1638
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,380
Oh, okay.

1639
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:36,539
So that means you have two.

1640
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:43,510
I don't think you do.

1641
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:48,189
I mean, you probably have two.

1642
01:40:48,189 --> 01:40:49,670
He gets two of these every time.

1643
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,670
And then he, he always calls.

1644
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:52,510
He always says,

1645
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:55,640
hey, what about the exact thing that you have?

1646
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,479
Yeah.

1647
01:40:56,479 --> 01:40:57,319
All right.

1648
01:40:57,319 --> 01:40:58,159
All right.

1649
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,500
I am.

1650
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,340
All right.

1651
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,180
I'm zapping this guy.

1652
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:07,890
I don't care what I get for it.

1653
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:09,149
Three twos.

1654
01:41:09,149 --> 01:41:09,989
Yeah.

1655
01:41:09,989 --> 01:41:17,880
Cause, cause you screwed me over.

1656
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:24,100
I can't win like this.

1657
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,600
Two twos.

1658
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:26,439
All right.

1659
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:27,869
How about three twos?

1660
01:41:27,869 --> 01:41:33,939
I mean, three ones.

1661
01:41:33,979 --> 01:41:34,819
Let me guess.

1662
01:41:34,819 --> 01:41:38,539
He's going to have one this time.

1663
01:41:38,539 --> 01:41:40,140
Oh, when you can, when you can't,

1664
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,420
when you can only mess with one die,

1665
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:46,159
it's not so easy, is it?

1666
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,000
Well, okay.

1667
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,439
If you, you have one, one.

1668
01:41:48,439 --> 01:41:49,279
All right.

1669
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:50,880
So let's go with two.

1670
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:51,960
I'll throw this right back at you.

1671
01:41:51,960 --> 01:42:00,590
Let's go.

1672
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:02,699
Okay.

1673
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:11,340
Somehow I'm clawing this back.

1674
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,180
Okay.

1675
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:16,979
There's one, one, two.

1676
01:42:16,979 --> 01:42:17,819
Okay.

1677
01:42:17,819 --> 01:42:19,460
You have to have two fours,

1678
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,180
which is there's no way.

1679
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:35,060
Oh my God.

1680
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:37,159
Cheating.

1681
01:42:37,159 --> 01:42:38,359
The farmer offers you an apple

1682
01:42:38,359 --> 01:42:44,229
as a token of appreciation.

1683
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:46,510
The creature offers you a dark purple drink,

1684
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:48,350
which it insists is simply water.

1685
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:50,300
It smells awful.

1686
01:42:50,300 --> 01:43:00,890
Why would I drink this?

1687
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:01,770
You take a drink.

1688
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:03,569
It tastes like the sewers beneath Carré,

1689
01:43:03,569 --> 01:43:06,760
but afterwards you feel strangely refreshed.

1690
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,920
I am very careful about what I drink.

1691
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,800
No ale or strange potions.

1692
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,500
Only pure water for me.

1693
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,100
You elect to keep going.

1694
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,939
The farming creature nods to you,

1695
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:20,039
then scurries away across the grass.

1696
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:29,789
The air stirs a little cold, but fresh.

1697
01:43:29,789 --> 01:43:34,970
Fuck that guy.

1698
01:43:34,970 --> 01:43:36,859
You pace on through the long grass.

1699
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,460
The stalks nearby shiver.

1700
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:41,770
And then the snake you saw earlier bursts up.

1701
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:44,529
You twist away as it rears up and goes for your neck

1702
01:43:44,529 --> 01:43:47,409
and your blade is out before it can disappear again.

1703
01:43:47,409 --> 01:43:50,069
And you track it with hawk eyes.

1704
01:43:50,069 --> 01:43:52,750
But you have fought larger serpents than this one.

1705
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:55,539
I'm going to burp.

1706
01:43:55,539 --> 01:44:01,539
Oh, can I talk?

1707
01:44:01,539 --> 01:44:03,140
You always tried the talk, right?

1708
01:44:06,939 --> 01:44:10,100
It's rap, right?

1709
01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:14,399
Sharpen.

1710
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:16,279
Zap is probably going to light the whole field on fire,

1711
01:44:16,279 --> 01:44:19,399
which I don't want to do.

1712
01:44:19,399 --> 01:44:21,060
Ooh.

1713
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:21,899
Law.

1714
01:44:21,899 --> 01:44:23,180
Control non-intelligent creatures.

1715
01:44:23,939 --> 01:44:27,649
Is a snake smart?

1716
01:44:27,649 --> 01:44:31,579
Find out.

1717
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:33,420
Insulting the stars, you bind the magic.

1718
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,619
The creature stops in its track.

1719
01:44:35,619 --> 01:44:37,659
Its will now bent to yours.

1720
01:44:41,659 --> 01:44:43,500
Should I kill it?

1721
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,229
I'm going to send it away.

1722
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:49,310
In a moment of conscience, you send the creature away.

1723
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:53,310
Your grip on its mind fades as it escapes into the grass.

1724
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:57,000
The grass waves and wafts around your feet.

1725
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
This could be a bucolic paradise

1726
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,840
if it wasn't for the looming ghoul

1727
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,989
of the sorcerer's spike to the east.

1728
01:45:04,029 --> 01:45:08,800
A few clouds drift across the sky.

1729
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:15,119
Should I just keep going?

1730
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,640
You move onwards through the field of wheat.

1731
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:19,520
You almost trip over a half-rotten tree stump

1732
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,380
lost in the long grasses.

1733
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:24,710
A low murmuring comes from inside the ancient wood.

1734
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:26,689
Is somebody in the tree?

1735
01:45:26,689 --> 01:45:28,619
You squat down and peer at the stump.

1736
01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:30,500
A bee crawls from a crack in the wood

1737
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:34,090
and takes off into the air as you watch.

1738
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:42,319
Why would I split open the beehive?

1739
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:48,909
Fucking starlight kid bucolic kid.

1740
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:51,819
Do it for science.

1741
01:45:51,819 --> 01:45:53,899
With your sword, you pry open a section of the wood

1742
01:45:53,899 --> 01:45:58,100
and a hundred bees spill out in a sudden angry swarm.

1743
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,140
They whip around in furious clouds

1744
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,329
searching for their attacker.

1745
01:46:03,329 --> 01:46:07,619
Ah, run from bees.

1746
01:46:07,619 --> 01:46:09,619
I'm the Archmage of Mampang.

1747
01:46:09,619 --> 01:46:11,739
I know there's an assassin to come and get me.

1748
01:46:11,739 --> 01:46:14,899
I know he's tracking through the universe to find me.

1749
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:18,140
Who's that out there in the weeds out there in the wheat?

1750
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,100
Is that Frank out there?

1751
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,840
No, who's that?

1752
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,279
No being swarmed by bees.

1753
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:23,279
That's my attacker.

1754
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:24,119
Oh, okay.

1755
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:29,979
I'm in deep trouble.

1756
01:46:29,979 --> 01:46:30,979
I think I'll be fine.

1757
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:35,779
In fact, I'm gonna keep the windows open.

1758
01:46:35,779 --> 01:46:41,069
Um, I'm just gonna look in the trunk.

1759
01:46:41,069 --> 01:46:42,949
You swat away the swarm as best you can

1760
01:46:42,949 --> 01:46:44,789
to look inside the trunk

1761
01:46:44,789 --> 01:46:47,979
where you can see a huge supply of beeswax.

1762
01:46:47,979 --> 01:46:50,460
The bees seize their chance to surround you.

1763
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:53,140
You fall but stagger quickly back to your feet.

1764
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,659
The stings are oversized like the plants here

1765
01:46:56,659 --> 01:46:58,819
and you feel the poison causing stiffness

1766
01:46:58,819 --> 01:47:00,899
and rictus in your body.

1767
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:03,380
You must keep moving.

1768
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:06,159
Reach in and get some beeswax.

1769
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:08,560
You scoop out several handfuls of beeswax,

1770
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,140
enough for six or seven spell castings,

1771
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,739
but the slightest hesitancy

1772
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:15,699
is enough for the bees to catch you.

1773
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:17,300
You gasp with pain.

1774
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,619
There is no time to waste.

1775
01:47:18,619 --> 01:47:19,960
Run.

1776
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:22,250
The bees are right behind you.

1777
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,689
You open your arms to cast a spell and the bees attack.

1778
01:47:24,689 --> 01:47:26,649
You fall but scramble quickly to your feet.

1779
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:30,659
You must keep moving.

1780
01:47:30,659 --> 01:47:32,630
Uh-oh.

1781
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:35,260
I have to go this way.

1782
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:38,100
You run forward, the swarm hot on your heels

1783
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,430
and the swarm of bees catches you stinging viciously.

1784
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:43,710
You gasp and bat at them furiously.

1785
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,909
You wail with pain.

1786
01:47:44,909 --> 01:47:46,390
You cannot take much more of this.

1787
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:50,819
There is no time to waste.

1788
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:53,659
The bees do not slow or stop as you rush forward.

1789
01:47:53,659 --> 01:47:55,939
You stand in the shadow of the inner wall by a heavy metal

1790
01:47:55,939 --> 01:47:58,130
door, the door is closed.

1791
01:47:58,130 --> 01:47:59,529
Open the door.

1792
01:47:59,529 --> 01:48:04,159
Oh, I'm dead.

1793
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:07,119
You try for the door and find it open but stiff.

1794
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:08,600
The bees reach you.

1795
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:12,449
The impact of a hundred stings is too much for you.

1796
01:48:12,449 --> 01:48:23,500
You succumb to the sound of a hundred furious bees.

1797
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:28,739
But then, after some time, you awaken.

1798
01:48:28,739 --> 01:48:31,500
The sun disappears heading towards the horizon.

1799
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,939
You ache all over.

1800
01:48:34,939 --> 01:48:37,739
Where am I?

1801
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,340
You lift your head.

1802
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:41,060
You're lying on a pallet.

1803
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,720
Be careful.

1804
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:48,229
You were very badly wounded before we carried you here.

1805
01:48:48,229 --> 01:48:50,649
Who are you?

1806
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,810
We're a friendly order.

1807
01:48:52,810 --> 01:48:54,670
Rest now.

1808
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:57,069
The figure bows its head and slips you away.

1809
01:48:57,069 --> 01:49:02,510
You pass out once more.

1810
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,020
Night has fallen.

1811
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:06,140
You need to rest, especially on an empty stomach.

1812
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,060
More time passes.

1813
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:09,890
How long have you been here?

1814
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:11,930
Get up.

1815
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:13,510
You struggle to your feet.

1816
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:17,149
You're in a monastery, it would seem, in a dormitory.

1817
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:18,069
You make your way slowly,

1818
01:49:18,069 --> 01:49:23,560
staggering up a short flight of stairs.

1819
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,649
Oh, I'm sorry.

1820
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:29,819
I, uh, I thought we were in the larder.

1821
01:49:29,819 --> 01:49:31,380
I thought we were that other person.

1822
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:32,380
Sorry about that.

1823
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:39,170
Changing voice now.

1824
01:49:39,170 --> 01:49:42,279
Sorry about that.

1825
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:45,840
Your footsteps echo on the cool stone floor.

1826
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,560
As you emerge into a wide hall,

1827
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:54,260
pews line one side, and an altar is in the corner.

1828
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,869
Let's rest.

1829
01:49:55,869 --> 01:49:57,829
You take a moment to rest on one of the stone benches.

1830
01:49:57,829 --> 01:49:59,229
It is a peaceful spot,

1831
01:49:59,229 --> 01:50:01,979
perhaps the most peaceful in all of Mampang.

1832
01:50:01,979 --> 01:50:04,380
All is quiet in the chamber.

1833
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,060
You could explore the monastery further,

1834
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:09,409
or go out into the streets.

1835
01:50:09,409 --> 01:50:14,619
I think we're gonna explore.

1836
01:50:14,619 --> 01:50:17,350
Uh, how about back in the dormitory?

1837
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:18,189
Sorry, I didn't die.

1838
01:50:18,189 --> 01:50:20,680
That's cool.

1839
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,840
You head down a short flight of steps

1840
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,119
into the dormitory's unseen.

1841
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:25,640
You're back in the dormitory

1842
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,640
where you nursed back to life

1843
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,930
after your encounter with the bees.

1844
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:33,210
The cots are filled with sleeping bodies.

1845
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:37,300
Should I go back to sleep?

1846
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,279
Look at the monk's habits.

1847
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:42,920
One of the habits looks to be your size.

1848
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:46,979
It has a large hood which will hide your face well.

1849
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:48,380
Put it on.

1850
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:50,100
You gather up the monk's concealing habit

1851
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,220
and quickly pull it on.

1852
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:56,350
Disguise.

1853
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:58,350
You will now pass as a monk.

1854
01:50:58,350 --> 01:51:01,670
A sense of great calm descends upon you.

1855
01:51:01,670 --> 01:51:04,220
Sleep.

1856
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,899
Trusting that your habit will keep you out of trouble,

1857
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:08,779
you stretch out on a berth.

1858
01:51:08,779 --> 01:51:09,739
Laying your pack down,

1859
01:51:09,739 --> 01:51:11,180
you try to stretch out under your habit

1860
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:13,180
despite the uncomfortable floor.

1861
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:14,779
You've not eaten today, but I do have food.

1862
01:51:14,779 --> 01:51:17,829
How?

1863
01:51:17,829 --> 01:51:19,310
Oh, the apple!

1864
01:51:19,310 --> 01:51:20,470
That's right.

1865
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:23,699
I forgot.

1866
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:24,859
Taking the apple from your pack,

1867
01:51:24,859 --> 01:51:26,420
you fill your empty stomach

1868
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:29,500
and try not to think about what you will eat tomorrow.

1869
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,619
Then you lie back and try to forget your troubles.

1870
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:35,380
You feel quite safe and you do not dream.

1871
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,300
All right, we're back.

1872
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:42,189
We're good.

1873
01:51:42,189 --> 01:51:43,310
I was gonna kill that guy too.

1874
01:51:43,310 --> 01:51:45,460
Thanks for the apple.

1875
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:49,100
You entered the monastery of Effie the Fortuitous,

1876
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:52,960
disguised yourself as a monk and found no new clues.

1877
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,609
Still unaware, which is good.

1878
01:51:57,609 --> 01:52:00,130
You wake refreshed, then sit bolt upright

1879
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:02,329
as you find six monks sitting around the bed,

1880
01:52:02,329 --> 01:52:04,130
washing you intently.

1881
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:06,930
As your eyes open, one punches the air

1882
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:08,710
and the other shakes their heads.

1883
01:52:08,710 --> 01:52:10,350
They exchange a few coins,

1884
01:52:10,350 --> 01:52:13,659
nod to you, and then move away.

1885
01:52:13,659 --> 01:52:15,140
With slow, solemn paces,

1886
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:19,180
you make your way back up to the steps.

1887
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:23,479
They're betting on if I was gonna wake up, I think.

1888
01:52:23,479 --> 01:52:24,920
Oh, I don't wanna spoil anything,

1889
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:28,729
but this is a good part of the game.

1890
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:30,899
You head back to the main chamber.

1891
01:52:30,899 --> 01:52:34,539
Chanting fills the space.

1892
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:36,460
Listen to the singing.

1893
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:38,619
You pause for a while to listen to the singing.

1894
01:52:38,619 --> 01:52:40,340
It is a strange tune.

1895
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:42,779
Sometimes harmonious,

1896
01:52:42,779 --> 01:52:46,390
but at other times, horrifically atonal.

1897
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,550
It is as though all the singers

1898
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:49,430
are singing their own songs,

1899
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:53,350
letting them coincide or conflict as luck would have it.

1900
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:54,789
The effect is rather unsettling

1901
01:52:54,789 --> 01:52:56,779
and not especially pleasant.

1902
01:52:56,779 --> 01:52:59,979
Monks move this way and that about their business.

1903
01:52:59,979 --> 01:53:02,630
It's time to make a choice on where you would go.

1904
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:08,979
Let's go on the altar.

1905
01:53:08,979 --> 01:53:11,460
You move closer to the altar and the pews.

1906
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:13,640
Some kind of service is going on.

1907
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,039
Monks are clustered in groups,

1908
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:17,420
chanting in a slurring monotone.

1909
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:19,859
A monk in bright red robes, the abbot,

1910
01:53:19,859 --> 01:53:22,579
stands with arms outstretched.

1911
01:53:22,579 --> 01:53:25,250
Let's watch the service.

1912
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,890
You stand and watch the service.

1913
01:53:26,890 --> 01:53:28,619
The chanting is odd,

1914
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:31,560
a droning buzz lacking discernible phrases.

1915
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:33,960
You catch snatches of what might be words,

1916
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,560
but they sound like a strange imitation of language.

1917
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,720
Some monks are jovial,

1918
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:40,079
whispering to each other and jostling,

1919
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:42,180
but others are solemn.

1920
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:43,140
Should we go back to bed?

1921
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:46,149
Snooze.

1922
01:53:46,149 --> 01:53:47,350
I'm going back to sleep.

1923
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:03,300
Create the illusion of worship.

1924
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,220
I know you wrote so funny in all caps.

1925
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:07,239
I know.

1926
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:08,079
I know.

1927
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:11,569
I'm not gonna do it.

1928
01:54:11,569 --> 01:54:18,789
I could teleport.

1929
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:34,090
Should I just cause everybody to go to sleep?

1930
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:35,369
It's not that I don't understand the language.

1931
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:38,430
They're all just talking over each other.

1932
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:45,020
Um, should I just make six of me?

1933
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:49,140
I'm making six of me.

1934
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:51,260
You gather the stars into your design around you

1935
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,619
and five clones step out from behind you,

1936
01:54:53,619 --> 01:54:55,220
forming a semicircle.

1937
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:59,189
The six of you sit side by side quietly.

1938
01:54:59,189 --> 01:55:02,029
See how our numbers have swelled,

1939
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:04,659
the abbot declares as he looks around the room.

1940
01:55:04,659 --> 01:55:07,420
The abbot, his bright habit distinguishing him,

1941
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:10,560
stands placidly at the front of the room.

1942
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,279
The altar near him is covered in bronze,

1943
01:55:12,279 --> 01:55:14,300
its top battered and pitted.

1944
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:17,220
Atop is a small bowl and a set of metal dice.

1945
01:55:17,220 --> 01:55:22,739
The chanting peters out and the abbot smiles.

1946
01:55:22,739 --> 01:55:27,069
Brothers and sisters, we give thanks to Effie.

1947
01:55:27,069 --> 01:55:32,270
We meditate on the changes and chances that fill our lives.

1948
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:36,310
We give ourselves over to the dice roll, to the risk,

1949
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:40,449
and let her nudge as she sees fit.

1950
01:55:40,449 --> 01:55:43,880
He gestures to a monk who approaches the altar.

1951
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:49,010
Sister, it is your day to roll.

1952
01:55:49,010 --> 01:55:52,220
Wait, a monk approaches, grasps the dice,

1953
01:55:52,220 --> 01:55:55,060
and then tosses them across the altar with a clang.

1954
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:59,029
The abbot considers the dice and tuts.

1955
01:55:59,029 --> 01:56:02,989
No luck for you, half rations for a day.

1956
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:05,949
Think upon this chance.

1957
01:56:05,949 --> 01:56:08,350
Snooze.

1958
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:10,829
There is a long stretch of chanting,

1959
01:56:10,829 --> 01:56:12,989
and then the service comes to an end.

1960
01:56:12,989 --> 01:56:14,789
The monks file out towards the gardens

1961
01:56:14,789 --> 01:56:16,630
or linger by the altar.

1962
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:18,579
The echoes die away.

1963
01:56:18,579 --> 01:56:21,420
The monks stand and file away.

1964
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:27,119
It's a gambler's den.

1965
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,800
You step back to the doors once more.

1966
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,319
One by one, your clones vanish.

1967
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:34,340
So we just gassed that guy up.

1968
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:37,960
That's all we did.

1969
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:44,350
That guy thought they added six new people, okay?

1970
01:56:44,350 --> 01:56:45,949
Behind you, the ceremony comes to an end

1971
01:56:45,949 --> 01:56:49,100
and monks file past into the courtyard.

1972
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:50,579
The abbot himself emerges from the room

1973
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:54,520
in quiet discussion with a few senior monks.

1974
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,359
Let's go talk to the abbot.

1975
01:56:56,359 --> 01:56:58,000
You catch the abbot's sleeve.

1976
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,680
Your head is bowed under your cowl,

1977
01:56:59,680 --> 01:57:02,890
but he still stops you.

1978
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:04,689
And what do you think you're doing?

1979
01:57:04,689 --> 01:57:07,819
He demands.

1980
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:09,840
Contemplating.

1981
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:12,270
It's not what you think.

1982
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:16,930
Father, look over there.

1983
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:18,449
Contemplating.

1984
01:57:18,449 --> 01:57:20,720
You reply.

1985
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,729
That so?

1986
01:57:22,729 --> 01:57:27,659
Contemplating.

1987
01:57:27,659 --> 01:57:29,699
Sound of my footsteps.

1988
01:57:29,699 --> 01:57:31,609
The rhythm of my breathing.

1989
01:57:31,609 --> 01:57:34,130
The cracks of the stone.

1990
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:37,430
All right, which one of these is gambling?

1991
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:39,270
Which one of these has a range?

1992
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:43,829
Probably cracks, right?

1993
01:57:43,829 --> 01:57:45,829
Like how many cracks will happen in the,

1994
01:57:45,829 --> 01:57:49,329
I feel like it's probably stone.

1995
01:57:49,329 --> 01:57:53,500
The cracks of the stone.

1996
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,939
They are indeed profound.

1997
01:57:55,939 --> 01:57:57,300
But.

1998
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,270
And he wags a finger.

1999
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:02,319
You cannot fool me so easily.

2000
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:03,529
Hmm.

2001
01:58:03,529 --> 01:58:07,069
Should you not be polishing the steps, novite?

2002
01:58:07,069 --> 01:58:09,869
He turns you gently about by the shoulders,

2003
01:58:09,869 --> 01:58:12,069
explaining a few points about the laziness

2004
01:58:12,069 --> 01:58:14,039
of the younger orders.

2005
01:58:14,039 --> 01:58:16,500
The abbot deposits you in the courtyard.

2006
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:17,939
Effie be with you.

2007
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:20,210
He murmurs before moving away.

2008
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:26,149
Oh, shoot.

2009
01:58:26,149 --> 01:58:28,939
This place seems rather busy for a monastery.

2010
01:58:28,939 --> 01:58:31,460
Monks and citizens crowd around long tables

2011
01:58:31,460 --> 01:58:34,529
and a commotion is coming from a crowd to one side.

2012
01:58:34,529 --> 01:58:37,689
Wide doors lead deeper into the monastery itself.

2013
01:58:37,689 --> 01:58:40,729
Small iron lined windows dot the walls,

2014
01:58:40,729 --> 01:58:44,210
allowing a little light.

2015
01:58:44,210 --> 01:58:46,600
What else can I do in here?

2016
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:47,800
I think you can actually,

2017
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:51,800
I think you can do more gambling.

2018
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:55,760
Let's do it.

2019
01:58:57,159 --> 01:59:01,010
Resurrect the dead.

2020
01:59:01,010 --> 01:59:10,010
Who's dead in here?

2021
01:59:10,010 --> 01:59:18,619
That's gonna consume the holy water though.

2022
01:59:18,659 --> 01:59:26,680
I can see the future in here.

2023
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:29,310
There are no animals in here.

2024
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:32,350
Do it.

2025
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:39,170
I don't think I wanna do it.

2026
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:44,659
I think I'm gonna use diplomacy.

2027
01:59:44,659 --> 01:59:46,859
Most of Effie's monks are gambling

2028
01:59:46,859 --> 01:59:49,250
or betting in one way or another.

2029
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:52,340
One stands on one leg while another count seconds.

2030
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:54,619
Opposite, two monks stand under a tree,

2031
01:59:54,619 --> 01:59:57,130
guessing when a particular leaf will fall.

2032
01:59:57,130 --> 01:59:59,729
Along a far wall surrounded by many spectators

2033
01:59:59,729 --> 02:00:04,510
is an intricate race course for rats.

2034
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:06,229
Let's go.

2035
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:08,189
The rattle of dice and the grumble of betting

2036
02:00:08,189 --> 02:00:10,619
comes from a side chamber.

2037
02:00:10,619 --> 02:00:17,340
The rat run, the dice chamber, or the hall.

2038
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:19,760
All right, let's go to rat run.

2039
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,520
You walk up to the rat course,

2040
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,359
elbowing your way through the crowd.

2041
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:24,720
Four rats are hurrying through

2042
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,560
an assortment of turns and obstacles,

2043
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,079
trying to reach a molding morsel of cheese

2044
02:00:29,079 --> 02:00:31,039
fixed to a spike at the far end.

2045
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:34,680
A monk with scars on his face directs the proceedings.

2046
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:37,609
The scarred monk looks up at you.

2047
02:00:37,609 --> 02:00:40,460
Here to bet?

2048
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:43,060
I have questions.

2049
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:45,149
Ask away?

2050
02:00:45,149 --> 02:00:47,180
Are the rats magical?

2051
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:48,619
Why do you gamble so much?

2052
02:00:48,619 --> 02:00:50,979
Do the rats enjoy racing?

2053
02:00:50,979 --> 02:00:53,380
What can I win?

2054
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:55,600
Are the rats magical?

2055
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,119
What, no.

2056
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,279
Why would we use magic rats?

2057
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:01,439
They just run, after all.

2058
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:04,319
What a horrible idea, anyway, a magical rat.

2059
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:14,420
Why do you gamble so much?

2060
02:01:14,420 --> 02:01:17,420
If you're really interested, ask one of the others.

2061
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:20,640
I'm busy.

2062
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,479
Do the rats enjoy racing?

2063
02:01:23,479 --> 02:01:24,949
I don't know.

2064
02:01:24,949 --> 02:01:26,109
They run without prodding.

2065
02:01:26,109 --> 02:01:28,390
Could be they like the cheese.

2066
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:30,069
The monk is called away by another

2067
02:01:30,069 --> 02:01:31,510
to supervise another race.

2068
02:01:34,850 --> 02:01:37,430
Should I bet?

2069
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:39,489
I wish to bet, you declare.

2070
02:01:39,489 --> 02:01:42,130
This should be an interesting race.

2071
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:45,039
The monk handling the wagers assures you.

2072
02:01:45,039 --> 02:01:48,000
The stake will be 30 gold pieces.

2073
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,079
What do you say?

2074
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:52,779
Oh my God.

2075
02:01:52,779 --> 02:01:55,420
That is too much, you admit.

2076
02:01:55,420 --> 02:01:57,260
The scarred monk shrugs and the race begins.

2077
02:01:57,260 --> 02:01:58,899
You leave the rat course behind.

2078
02:01:58,899 --> 02:02:08,100
I don't have any money.

2079
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,800
Okay.

2080
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:23,819
Should I just fuck the whole thing up?

2081
02:02:23,819 --> 02:02:27,039
Doc is heal disease.

2082
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:31,359
What about seeing the future?

2083
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:32,840
Oh, if I win the bets or not?

2084
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:36,800
Okay, fine.

2085
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,039
You sit cross-legged on the ground

2086
02:02:38,039 --> 02:02:39,600
and put your palms on the orb.

2087
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:40,640
You craft the enchantment

2088
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:43,479
and everything I imagined using this.

2089
02:02:43,479 --> 02:02:45,920
You see yourself laying down bet after bet

2090
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,119
against a table full of scurrying creatures,

2091
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:50,979
but without rhyme or reason.

2092
02:02:50,979 --> 02:02:55,210
Days seem to pass and you grow thin and haggard.

2093
02:02:55,210 --> 02:03:01,130
The crown forgotten in an ecstasy of gambling.

2094
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:08,310
The vision of rather puritanical one at that fades.

2095
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:09,710
So wait, if I gamble,

2096
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:13,729
am I gonna just get stuck here or something?

2097
02:03:14,569 --> 02:03:23,710
Okay, what else can I do?

2098
02:03:23,710 --> 02:03:25,670
You need to talk to the rats.

2099
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:27,859
Maybe I could.

2100
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:34,960
Am I within a certain distance?

2101
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:36,079
Taking the wig from your pack,

2102
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:38,039
you wear it and form your spell.

2103
02:03:38,039 --> 02:03:40,279
There are no animals around to talk to,

2104
02:03:40,279 --> 02:03:41,479
but from the rat race course,

2105
02:03:41,479 --> 02:03:44,090
you can hear a tiny voice.

2106
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:45,250
I win again.

2107
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:48,329
The cheese is mine, you bumpkins.

2108
02:03:48,329 --> 02:03:50,689
It seems the gambling at the monastery goes on

2109
02:03:50,689 --> 02:03:54,199
even in the middle of the day.

2110
02:03:54,199 --> 02:03:55,039
I win again.

2111
02:03:55,039 --> 02:04:03,579
The cheese is mine.

2112
02:04:03,579 --> 02:04:06,380
Even the rats are gambling.

2113
02:04:06,819 --> 02:04:07,899
I don't know if I can do very much

2114
02:04:07,899 --> 02:04:09,420
besides throw a fireball,

2115
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,899
so I don't think I'm gonna do it.

2116
02:04:16,229 --> 02:04:22,500
What about how?

2117
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:23,659
Reaching up to the constellations,

2118
02:04:23,659 --> 02:04:24,659
you create the spell.

2119
02:04:24,659 --> 02:04:27,729
A quiet voice begins to speak to you.

2120
02:04:27,729 --> 02:04:31,199
Effie may take you into her grace,

2121
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:34,819
but she is a fickle patron.

2122
02:04:34,819 --> 02:04:36,899
The rats continue to bicker and argue

2123
02:04:36,899 --> 02:04:41,470
from the race course.

2124
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:45,260
I didn't go in the dice chamber,

2125
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:50,960
so let's go in there and win in swindle stones.

2126
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:52,319
You walk over into a long room

2127
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:53,199
set with a wooden table

2128
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:55,119
on which several games of swindle stones

2129
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:56,319
are being played.

2130
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:58,979
You find a monk who grins at you.

2131
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:01,140
Fancy a game, brother?

2132
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:06,479
We stake 10 gold pieces in Effie's honor.

2133
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:07,640
The stake is too much.

2134
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:08,479
I have.

2135
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:12,140
Oh, I don't have it.

2136
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:14,659
That is too much, you tell the monk.

2137
02:05:14,659 --> 02:05:15,829
Here then.

2138
02:05:15,829 --> 02:05:18,899
He hands you 10 gold pieces from his pocket.

2139
02:05:18,899 --> 02:05:20,579
In Effie's honor.

2140
02:05:20,579 --> 02:05:22,710
Now a game.

2141
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:26,649
Oh, okay, let's go.

2142
02:05:26,649 --> 02:05:27,489
Three dice.

2143
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:28,829
All right, let's go.

2144
02:05:28,829 --> 02:05:30,859
No cheating.

2145
02:05:30,859 --> 02:05:31,699
Good hand.

2146
02:05:32,949 --> 02:05:34,189
Unbeatable hand.

2147
02:05:34,189 --> 02:05:36,060
Actually, it's an unbeatable hand.

2148
02:05:36,899 --> 02:05:48,529
All right, you think there are one of those.

2149
02:05:48,529 --> 02:05:52,710
All right, do I say there are four?

2150
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:55,050
I think I get him off guard here.

2151
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:57,970
There are four of those.

2152
02:05:57,970 --> 02:06:00,970
Four threes.

2153
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:05,460
Call it, that's fine.

2154
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:07,180
Got it.

2155
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:16,779
Yeah, there's no way you bluffed that early.

2156
02:06:16,779 --> 02:06:17,859
I'm gonna get, let's get weird.

2157
02:06:17,859 --> 02:06:18,979
One, two ones.

2158
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:36,079
Uh-oh, okay.

2159
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:37,319
I have one of them.

2160
02:06:37,319 --> 02:06:47,859
He only has two dice.

2161
02:06:47,859 --> 02:06:50,630
Three twos.

2162
02:06:50,630 --> 02:06:52,310
I could call three,

2163
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:56,659
but I think he knows that he,

2164
02:06:56,659 --> 02:07:02,010
that's kind of hard.

2165
02:07:02,010 --> 02:07:02,850
I'll do it.

2166
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:05,020
I'll do it.

2167
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,739
Three fours.

2168
02:07:06,739 --> 02:07:19,140
Okay, now you're in trouble.

2169
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:20,600
What do you got?

2170
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:23,899
One one.

2171
02:07:23,899 --> 02:07:29,590
Two ones.

2172
02:07:29,590 --> 02:07:31,510
Three ones.

2173
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:32,869
Aw.

2174
02:07:32,869 --> 02:07:34,109
Thanks for playing.

2175
02:07:34,109 --> 02:07:37,260
Hey, thanks for the free money.

2176
02:07:37,260 --> 02:07:40,069
That was fun.

2177
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:41,590
This guy gave me 10 bucks

2178
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:45,439
to make sure he could play dice against somebody

2179
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:46,439
and then he lost it.

2180
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:48,159
So I got 20 bucks.

2181
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:52,970
This guy gave me $20 to play a game with him.

2182
02:07:52,970 --> 02:07:55,239
I win, don't I?

2183
02:07:55,239 --> 02:07:57,079
The monk nods with great pleasure

2184
02:07:57,079 --> 02:07:58,760
and hands over 10 gold pieces

2185
02:07:58,760 --> 02:08:01,020
as you take back your stake.

2186
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:03,140
A fine match.

2187
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:06,079
Another?

2188
02:08:06,079 --> 02:08:11,180
Let's increase the stakes a little.

2189
02:08:11,779 --> 02:08:12,859
This is how he wants to get you.

2190
02:08:12,859 --> 02:08:14,119
This is what he, okay.

2191
02:08:14,119 --> 02:08:17,710
So he wants, we won.

2192
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:22,310
I'm done.

2193
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:23,579
The monk nods.

2194
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:26,180
True luck does not always favor play.

2195
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:27,260
He agrees.

2196
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:28,500
You get up from the long table,

2197
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:30,510
the monk bidding you goodbye.

2198
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:35,239
I just left with 20 extra gold

2199
02:08:35,239 --> 02:08:38,569
and we're taking it right to the rats.

2200
02:08:38,569 --> 02:08:39,689
Oh, I need 30.

2201
02:08:39,689 --> 02:08:41,020
Nevermind.

2202
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:44,409
Shit.

2203
02:08:44,409 --> 02:08:45,369
Yeah, guys, I'm gonna win.

2204
02:08:45,369 --> 02:08:47,850
I'm gonna walk away from that table.

2205
02:08:47,850 --> 02:08:50,949
I made 20 bucks

2206
02:08:50,949 --> 02:08:53,350
and I'm gonna go sit at a different table.

2207
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:55,189
I walked away from that.

2208
02:08:55,229 --> 02:08:58,869
Come on.

2209
02:08:58,869 --> 02:09:07,380
I'm gonna, I wanna play the rat race.

2210
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:08,220
You have to play one more time

2211
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:11,500
to get enough for rats.

2212
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:13,020
Oh, hey, a win is a win.

2213
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,939
I'm taking my 20 bucks out of here.

2214
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:15,779
Rat, it's too much.

2215
02:09:15,779 --> 02:09:22,430
Rat is 30.

2216
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:23,270
I wonder, hold on.

2217
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:25,909
Let me go back in the hall.

2218
02:09:25,909 --> 02:09:28,350
The monastery is busy and peaceful yet enough.

2219
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:30,750
Okay.

2220
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:31,750
Can I run into that?

2221
02:09:31,750 --> 02:09:33,109
I'm, I'm.

2222
02:09:33,109 --> 02:09:33,949
Shit.

2223
02:09:33,949 --> 02:09:39,810
I think I missed my opportunity.

2224
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:42,180
I think I missed my opportunity.

2225
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:43,619
I could probably go back to sleep,

2226
02:09:43,619 --> 02:09:48,800
which might not be a bad idea.

2227
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,640
No, dammit.

2228
02:09:49,640 --> 02:10:06,930
All right, I think, I think I gotta go.

2229
02:10:06,930 --> 02:10:11,979
All right, 10 gold, let's go.

2230
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:15,170
Two ones.

2231
02:10:15,930 --> 02:10:16,770
All right, check this out.

2232
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,609
I'm gonna say there are,

2233
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:22,159
I'm gonna say there are two ones.

2234
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,840
There are two of those.

2235
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,539
There are two of those.

2236
02:10:26,539 --> 02:10:28,840
Two threes.

2237
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,319
Two fours.

2238
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:32,159
You need to have them.

2239
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:33,600
I, I don't think you have them,

2240
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:36,390
but you need to have those.

2241
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:40,949
I could say three fours

2242
02:10:40,949 --> 02:10:43,970
or go with three twos or three ones.

2243
02:10:50,229 --> 02:10:53,310
I'm gonna call it.

2244
02:10:53,310 --> 02:10:56,060
Yep.

2245
02:10:56,060 --> 02:10:56,899
Okay.

2246
02:10:56,899 --> 02:11:04,500
It was a risky play, but I got it.

2247
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:08,180
How about one one?

2248
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:09,770
Two ones.

2249
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:11,460
Say you have both of them.

2250
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:13,119
Let's see it.

2251
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:17,850
Ooh.

2252
02:11:17,850 --> 02:11:18,930
Okay.

2253
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:27,560
Shit.

2254
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:30,920
I mean, I have one of those.

2255
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:31,760
Call it.

2256
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,470
Oh, there's no way you've got a double twice in a row.

2257
02:11:35,470 --> 02:11:38,050
No way, right?

2258
02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:38,890
Yeah.

2259
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:50,850
We're good.

2260
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:52,699
I can ruin this whole thing for him.

2261
02:11:52,699 --> 02:11:54,479
Watch this.

2262
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:55,319
Let's go all the way up here.

2263
02:11:55,319 --> 02:12:00,810
Two of these.

2264
02:12:00,810 --> 02:12:01,649
You're full of shit.

2265
02:12:01,649 --> 02:12:17,699
You don't have one of those.

2266
02:12:17,699 --> 02:12:21,159
Oh, no.

2267
02:12:21,159 --> 02:12:25,100
I have one too.

2268
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:28,060
I fucked it up so bad, I think.

2269
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:29,939
That was not a bad play though.

2270
02:12:29,939 --> 02:12:33,489
You can't tell me that was a bad play.

2271
02:12:33,489 --> 02:12:34,810
I could call them right here.

2272
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:41,140
No, I have to say there's one three.

2273
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:44,100
Yes.

2274
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:45,819
Why would you do that?

2275
02:12:45,819 --> 02:12:47,380
He just threw it away so bad.

2276
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:49,680
What?

2277
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:52,180
I had 37 gold.

2278
02:12:52,180 --> 02:12:53,300
All right, now I'm up.

2279
02:12:53,300 --> 02:13:02,420
So now I can do one more.

2280
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:09,500
Okay, one two.

2281
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,460
Yeah, there are two twos.

2282
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:13,170
I've got one.

2283
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:14,010
Three twos.

2284
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:14,850
Yes.

2285
02:13:14,850 --> 02:13:16,170
I mean, there's no way you have it.

2286
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:27,869
Goodbye.

2287
02:13:27,869 --> 02:13:29,949
A random farmer is better at this

2288
02:13:29,949 --> 02:13:33,619
than the literal acolyte of the gambling god.

2289
02:13:33,619 --> 02:13:36,220
But the farmer was cheating.

2290
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:37,579
Okay, one one.

2291
02:13:37,579 --> 02:13:38,920
Let's go.

2292
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:40,760
Let's really fuck him up big time.

2293
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:43,060
Watch this.

2294
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,180
Two threes.

2295
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:54,859
Let's go right off the bat.

2296
02:13:54,859 --> 02:14:03,420
I know that was funny.

2297
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:08,939
One three.

2298
02:14:08,939 --> 02:14:12,659
Oh, I dare say there are two threes.

2299
02:14:12,659 --> 02:14:15,729
You think there are three?

2300
02:14:15,729 --> 02:14:23,199
Dare say there's a third one.

2301
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:25,899
Hey, I'm of the philosophy now.

2302
02:14:25,899 --> 02:14:27,630
Now you just bet till you lose.

2303
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:31,130
And when you lose once, you're done.

2304
02:14:31,130 --> 02:14:32,170
I'm up.

2305
02:14:32,170 --> 02:14:34,210
I'm up like more than 100%.

2306
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:35,050
You know what I mean?

2307
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:37,329
At this point, like you play till you lose one fucking hand

2308
02:14:37,329 --> 02:14:46,539
and then you leave.

2309
02:14:46,539 --> 02:14:51,310
Okay, one three.

2310
02:14:51,310 --> 02:14:53,520
This might, I'm gonna go all the way.

2311
02:14:53,520 --> 02:15:05,109
Let's make him have to commit to saying that there are four,

2312
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:08,300
which I doubt is true.

2313
02:15:08,340 --> 02:15:12,880
Wait a minute.

2314
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:18,090
There are two twos.

2315
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:18,930
Okay.

2316
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:20,340
Okay.

2317
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:21,180
Guess what?

2318
02:15:21,180 --> 02:15:24,949
I think there are three of those.

2319
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:40,060
No, make him have to say five.

2320
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:40,899
What?

2321
02:15:40,899 --> 02:15:41,739
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2322
02:15:41,739 --> 02:15:54,670
He only had three?

2323
02:15:54,670 --> 02:15:55,909
Don't call it, please.

2324
02:15:55,909 --> 02:15:57,149
Okay, two.

2325
02:15:57,149 --> 02:16:05,399
Uh, hmm.

2326
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:11,489
He might have two of them.

2327
02:16:11,489 --> 02:16:15,590
Oh shit.

2328
02:16:15,590 --> 02:16:19,359
Of course he does.

2329
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:20,199
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2330
02:16:20,199 --> 02:16:21,039
What just happened?

2331
02:16:21,039 --> 02:16:21,880
What did I just do?

2332
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:22,720
What did I just do?

2333
02:16:22,720 --> 02:16:23,560
Did I do something wrong?

2334
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:24,899
What happened?

2335
02:16:24,899 --> 02:16:30,720
Wasn't I just trying to say that he didn't have those?

2336
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:35,059
Wait, what?

2337
02:16:35,059 --> 02:16:41,590
Oh, I fucking, I screwed up.

2338
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:44,920
One two.

2339
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:45,799
Why can I not say there?

2340
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:51,600
Oh, he's saying there are two ones.

2341
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:52,440
There are three ones.

2342
02:16:52,440 --> 02:17:00,500
Uh-oh.

2343
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:04,709
There are though.

2344
02:17:04,709 --> 02:17:06,049
Yeah.

2345
02:17:06,049 --> 02:17:14,110
Sorry, that's one too many.

2346
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:18,780
There's one four.

2347
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:20,020
Ooh, okay.

2348
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:22,190
This is where we get him right here.

2349
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:23,229
Cause he has to have a double

2350
02:17:23,229 --> 02:17:25,549
and I'm willing to take that risk.

2351
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:26,389
Brought it all the way back.

2352
02:17:26,389 --> 02:17:35,729
Let's go.

2353
02:17:35,729 --> 02:17:37,209
Okay, now we got him because we both,

2354
02:17:37,209 --> 02:17:41,139
wait, he might be lying.

2355
02:17:41,139 --> 02:17:43,180
There's one.

2356
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:44,969
Hold on.

2357
02:17:44,969 --> 02:17:49,329
If he has one of those, there are two in play.

2358
02:17:49,329 --> 02:17:51,489
I feel like I have to just say there's one of these to,

2359
02:17:51,489 --> 02:17:53,569
no, I have to make him say there's three.

2360
02:17:53,569 --> 02:17:56,700
But what if he doesn't have one?

2361
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:57,620
He might just be,

2362
02:17:58,299 --> 02:17:59,139
usually if you have one,

2363
02:17:59,139 --> 02:18:02,780
you don't say the thing you actually have.

2364
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:04,020
So if I say there's two of these

2365
02:18:04,020 --> 02:18:11,620
and he has like a two, then I'm, I lose.

2366
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:20,739
I think I have to just say one.

2367
02:18:20,739 --> 02:18:29,629
One of us had to,

2368
02:18:29,629 --> 02:18:33,389
it's, aren't I always screwed in that case?

2369
02:18:33,389 --> 02:18:34,229
Did I actually throw?

2370
02:18:34,229 --> 02:18:37,270
Because he could be making it up still,

2371
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:38,549
but now he's not though.

2372
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:40,290
So he wasn't making it up.

2373
02:18:40,290 --> 02:18:43,450
When you have one die left in liar's dice

2374
02:18:43,450 --> 02:18:45,940
or swindle stones, whatever you want to say.

2375
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:49,420
I mean, if he says one, two,

2376
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:52,180
if he says one three,

2377
02:18:52,219 --> 02:18:56,930
he could have like a four under there.

2378
02:18:56,930 --> 02:18:59,090
So he actually did have it.

2379
02:18:59,090 --> 02:19:01,319
He actually did have it.

2380
02:19:01,319 --> 02:19:03,100
He wasn't lying.

2381
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:10,829
Last one.

2382
02:19:10,829 --> 02:19:11,909
All right.

2383
02:19:11,909 --> 02:19:14,850
One, four.

2384
02:19:14,850 --> 02:19:18,549
There are two twos.

2385
02:19:18,549 --> 02:19:19,590
Three twos.

2386
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:25,950
What's the chance that you have two of those?

2387
02:19:25,950 --> 02:19:34,329
None.

2388
02:19:34,329 --> 02:19:36,690
This is a good hand for me.

2389
02:19:36,690 --> 02:19:45,979
Let's say there's one, three, one.

2390
02:19:45,979 --> 02:19:56,469
Okay.

2391
02:19:56,469 --> 02:20:01,840
There are two of those.

2392
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:02,879
There are, okay.

2393
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:04,639
So you're telling me every single one of yours

2394
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:06,819
is all three of them.

2395
02:20:06,819 --> 02:20:14,739
You're full of shit.

2396
02:20:14,739 --> 02:20:34,110
Okay. Two and a four.

2397
02:20:34,110 --> 02:20:36,069
There's a couple of ways to do this.

2398
02:20:36,069 --> 02:20:37,270
There's do it for real.

2399
02:20:37,270 --> 02:20:39,629
And we both have one, two.

2400
02:20:40,030 --> 02:20:47,959
You might have two twos.

2401
02:20:47,959 --> 02:20:50,770
Let's go with this.

2402
02:20:50,770 --> 02:20:52,680
Call it.

2403
02:20:52,680 --> 02:21:12,319
All right.

2404
02:21:12,319 --> 02:21:13,159
Come on.

2405
02:21:13,159 --> 02:21:14,000
Do you have two?

2406
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:14,840
Do you have snake eyes?

2407
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:15,680
Please, you don't.

2408
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,409
You don't have two.

2409
02:21:18,409 --> 02:21:28,450
Ah, come on.

2410
02:21:28,450 --> 02:21:29,729
I'm winning this one.

2411
02:21:29,729 --> 02:21:40,600
Check this out.

2412
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:41,440
Okay.

2413
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:51,860
What was his first one?

2414
02:21:51,860 --> 02:21:53,200
You definitely have two.

2415
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:56,969
He's got two.

2416
02:21:56,969 --> 02:22:06,979
Yeah, I'm going to get my money back.

2417
02:22:06,979 --> 02:22:15,190
What two ones?

2418
02:22:15,190 --> 02:22:16,350
One, two.

2419
02:22:16,350 --> 02:22:40,469
Okay.

2420
02:22:40,469 --> 02:22:41,870
The probability that this is wrong,

2421
02:22:41,870 --> 02:22:42,709
he's going to call this

2422
02:22:42,709 --> 02:22:43,549
because he's going to be like,

2423
02:22:43,549 --> 02:22:47,219
what the fuck are you talking about?

2424
02:22:47,219 --> 02:22:49,809
Because I don't think he has a two.

2425
02:22:49,809 --> 02:22:51,520
He's just going to call it

2426
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:55,350
and I'm going to lose.

2427
02:22:55,350 --> 02:22:56,190
I mean, I'll do it.

2428
02:22:56,190 --> 02:22:57,110
It's like the best play,

2429
02:22:57,110 --> 02:23:00,500
but he, yeah, he doesn't have a two.

2430
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:02,100
If he has a two, that'd be crazy.

2431
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:04,370
Wow.

2432
02:23:04,370 --> 02:23:05,690
How did he have a two?

2433
02:23:05,690 --> 02:23:11,500
Okay.

2434
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:13,040
All right, we got the money back.

2435
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:15,110
One, one.

2436
02:23:15,110 --> 02:23:16,510
Well, I dare say, wait a minute.

2437
02:23:16,510 --> 02:23:17,350
He could be lying,

2438
02:23:17,350 --> 02:23:18,430
but let's just call him out on it.

2439
02:23:18,430 --> 02:23:19,270
There are two ones.

2440
02:23:19,270 --> 02:23:20,479
Call it.

2441
02:23:20,479 --> 02:23:21,319
That's fine.

2442
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:22,159
There cannot be three ones.

2443
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:23,280
It's physically not possible.

2444
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:28,520
I will take my money back, please.

2445
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:29,360
Okay.

2446
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:30,200
Hey, look at that.

2447
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:32,180
We're exactly where we just were.

2448
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:37,280
Can you lend me more money?

2449
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,899
Can you lend me more money?

2450
02:23:39,899 --> 02:23:41,370
I cannot.

2451
02:23:41,370 --> 02:23:43,409
Effie does not wish us to be generous

2452
02:23:43,409 --> 02:23:49,579
as generosity defies the action of luck.

2453
02:23:49,579 --> 02:23:53,020
Okay, that was fun.

2454
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:53,860
The monk nods.

2455
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:55,639
You get up from the long table.

2456
02:23:55,639 --> 02:24:00,670
You bid the monk farewell.

2457
02:24:00,670 --> 02:24:03,309
So I just want to make sure I get this clear

2458
02:24:03,309 --> 02:24:05,200
with everybody here watching.

2459
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,520
The whole idea was everyone was like,

2460
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:07,879
get up, no, stop gambling.

2461
02:24:07,879 --> 02:24:08,760
Get up from that table.

2462
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:09,600
Get out of here.

2463
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:10,680
Get up.

2464
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:12,719
And now bet even more over there,

2465
02:24:12,719 --> 02:24:15,200
is what you're saying.

2466
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,840
The price for entry is 30 gold over here.

2467
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:21,620
It's 10 over there.

2468
02:24:21,620 --> 02:24:26,739
Okay.

2469
02:24:26,739 --> 02:24:27,979
You head back to the rat course.

2470
02:24:27,979 --> 02:24:29,700
Spectators stand either side,

2471
02:24:30,379 --> 02:24:31,459
the monk ripping money.

2472
02:24:31,459 --> 02:24:33,209
The scarred monk greets you.

2473
02:24:33,209 --> 02:24:35,819
A bet, I hope.

2474
02:24:35,819 --> 02:24:38,000
I wish to bet.

2475
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,760
This round will be an odd round.

2476
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:43,819
The monk handling the wagers assures you.

2477
02:24:43,819 --> 02:24:46,180
It's 30 gold pieces.

2478
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:49,409
What do you say?

2479
02:24:49,409 --> 02:24:50,809
An odd round.

2480
02:24:50,809 --> 02:24:52,049
Should I watch one?

2481
02:24:52,049 --> 02:24:54,750
We're gonna pass.

2482
02:24:54,750 --> 02:24:57,030
You declined to bet and the race goes on.

2483
02:24:57,030 --> 02:25:01,260
The rat you had your eye on loses by inches.

2484
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,750
Next round starting soon.

2485
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:05,229
You in for this one?

2486
02:25:05,229 --> 02:25:06,430
It's 30 gold pieces.

2487
02:25:06,430 --> 02:25:14,190
What do you say?

2488
02:25:14,190 --> 02:25:17,149
You place your coin on a promising looking rat.

2489
02:25:17,149 --> 02:25:18,909
The four rats shoot off,

2490
02:25:18,909 --> 02:25:21,389
climbing a steep hill made of wood and paper.

2491
02:25:21,389 --> 02:25:24,329
Your pick stumbles near the top.

2492
02:25:24,329 --> 02:25:26,329
The rats then jostle through a narrow tunnel

2493
02:25:26,329 --> 02:25:29,850
and your favorite nearly gains the lead.

2494
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:31,290
The rats round a sharp corner

2495
02:25:31,290 --> 02:25:32,809
and then rush towards the finish line.

2496
02:25:32,809 --> 02:25:34,569
Yours looks confident as it nears the end

2497
02:25:34,569 --> 02:25:37,459
though it's hard to tell with a rat.

2498
02:25:37,459 --> 02:25:40,159
Your rat comes in.

2499
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:42,040
It scurries across the finish line with no room to spare.

2500
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:43,760
The monks grown as the race ends.

2501
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:46,399
The scarred monk hands you over your...

2502
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:47,639
I won!

2503
02:25:47,639 --> 02:25:50,579
I got a hundred bucks.

2504
02:25:50,579 --> 02:25:53,829
The scarred monk hands over your money grinning.

2505
02:25:53,829 --> 02:25:57,340
The rats are scooped up and watered

2506
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:59,540
and then placed back at the start.

2507
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:01,680
They seem eager to go.

2508
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,120
And he vexed for the next round.

2509
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:04,559
It's 30 gold pieces.

2510
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:05,440
Let's go again.

2511
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,989
No.

2512
02:26:07,989 --> 02:26:09,930
You shrug losing interest in the race.

2513
02:26:09,930 --> 02:26:12,329
You leave the rat course behind.

2514
02:26:12,329 --> 02:26:16,620
I got 97 bucks.

2515
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:22,899
That's good enough for me.

2516
02:26:22,899 --> 02:26:29,340
I just have a question.

2517
02:26:29,340 --> 02:26:31,260
My question is how high are the stakes

2518
02:26:31,260 --> 02:26:35,850
in the Swindlestone's gambling room?

2519
02:26:36,450 --> 02:26:39,540
I just have a question.

2520
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:43,260
You had seven before betting.

2521
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:48,379
I did have seven gold before I came in here.

2522
02:26:48,379 --> 02:26:50,219
That is a monstrous increase.

2523
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:53,620
I'm going to take it and leave.

2524
02:26:53,620 --> 02:26:58,219
I'm going to take it and leave.

2525
02:26:58,219 --> 02:27:00,920
You make your way down the steps and out of the yard.

2526
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,809
It's time to leave.

2527
02:27:04,809 --> 02:27:08,010
Back out to the road.

2528
02:27:08,010 --> 02:27:08,850
All right.

2529
02:27:08,850 --> 02:27:09,930
I'm going to go be right back.

2530
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:11,799
I'm going to refill my tea

2531
02:27:11,799 --> 02:27:15,370
and I will see you guys in a few minutes.

2532
02:27:15,370 --> 02:39:05,569
Be right back.

2533
02:39:05,569 --> 02:39:06,930
I made a tea.

2534
02:39:06,930 --> 02:39:14,139
Took a little bit.

2535
02:39:14,139 --> 02:39:17,940
I took a little extra minutes.

2536
02:39:17,940 --> 02:39:18,780
Refunded.

2537
02:39:18,819 --> 02:39:21,809
What are you betting on?

2538
02:39:21,809 --> 02:39:23,409
You guys making bets on when I was...

2539
02:39:23,409 --> 02:39:30,409
If I was going to come back?

2540
02:39:30,409 --> 02:39:35,959
I just don't come back.

2541
02:39:35,959 --> 02:39:38,700
Well, that would have been a crazy return.

2542
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:42,430
I'm imagining nobody was doing that.

2543
02:39:42,430 --> 02:39:45,930
That would have been like a 100 to one return

2544
02:39:45,930 --> 02:39:50,620
on channel points.

2545
02:39:50,620 --> 02:39:54,000
All right, let's go.

2546
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,229
We stepped out of the gambling hall,

2547
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:00,309
back in a Manpang.

2548
02:40:00,309 --> 02:40:02,459
And this is where we ended up.

2549
02:40:02,459 --> 02:40:06,110
Not very far from where we just were.

2550
02:40:06,110 --> 02:40:08,950
We got attacked by bees over here.

2551
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:14,739
We kind of died.

2552
02:40:14,739 --> 02:40:16,620
Do we want to go back this way again?

2553
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:18,520
I was going to go this way.

2554
02:40:18,520 --> 02:40:21,540
That's where I was going to be.

2555
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:23,709
So let's just continue our journey

2556
02:40:23,709 --> 02:40:29,579
the same way that we were going to go.

2557
02:40:29,579 --> 02:40:31,819
The road curves along the edge of a tall stone wall,

2558
02:40:31,819 --> 02:40:35,090
eventually reaching the door to the wheat fields.

2559
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:37,100
Not going back in there.

2560
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:38,639
We're going this way.

2561
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:45,219
It's where I was going to go before.

2562
02:40:45,219 --> 02:40:46,979
You continue along the road.

2563
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:49,459
The sun has reached its highest point now.

2564
02:40:49,459 --> 02:40:50,899
You pass a side street,

2565
02:40:50,899 --> 02:40:56,379
leading off into a maze of smaller streets and alleys.

2566
02:40:56,379 --> 02:41:03,180
The maze side streets are over here.

2567
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:04,579
Eh, side streets are fun.

2568
02:41:04,579 --> 02:41:08,370
Let's go down here.

2569
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:11,489
You walk down a narrow street lined by low warehouses.

2570
02:41:11,489 --> 02:41:14,260
You catch the scent of grain as you pass one.

2571
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:17,139
You're into the middle part of the day,

2572
02:41:17,139 --> 02:41:19,559
and yet the citadel is still cold.

2573
02:41:19,559 --> 02:41:20,559
As you turn a slight corner,

2574
02:41:20,559 --> 02:41:22,280
you spy three guards walking towards you.

2575
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:25,690
One dressed in a finery of a captain.

2576
02:41:25,690 --> 02:41:33,319
Distracted by conversation, they have yet to spot you.

2577
02:41:33,319 --> 02:41:37,530
Um, hide in a warehouse.

2578
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:40,129
You hurry quickly over to the door of a nearby warehouse

2579
02:41:40,129 --> 02:41:42,899
and slip inside.

2580
02:41:42,899 --> 02:41:46,579
I'm not messing with that right now.

2581
02:41:46,579 --> 02:41:49,389
The large warehouse is filled with stacks of crates,

2582
02:41:49,389 --> 02:41:52,739
but as you enter, you hear a guard speak.

2583
02:41:54,479 --> 02:41:56,010
See what?

2584
02:41:56,010 --> 02:41:58,879
Someone just went in that building.

2585
02:41:58,879 --> 02:42:02,000
Footsteps grow louder as they approach the entrance.

2586
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,170
Hide.

2587
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:06,290
You duck into the narrow passage between the crates,

2588
02:42:06,290 --> 02:42:08,190
weaving in the gloom.

2589
02:42:08,190 --> 02:42:09,930
The air here is stuffy,

2590
02:42:09,930 --> 02:42:11,969
and you resist the urge to sneeze

2591
02:42:11,969 --> 02:42:15,450
as you disturb layers of dust.

2592
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:17,209
Oh, thank God.

2593
02:42:17,209 --> 02:42:20,170
Hidden, you watch the three guards stop at the threshold,

2594
02:42:20,170 --> 02:42:22,219
trying to catch sight of you.

2595
02:42:22,219 --> 02:42:25,739
It still must be in here, one says.

2596
02:42:25,739 --> 02:42:26,700
They begin to creep along,

2597
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:29,829
probing stacks of cloth with drawn blades.

2598
02:42:29,829 --> 02:42:33,479
Their captain stands at the entrance, feet planted wide.

2599
02:42:33,479 --> 02:42:35,770
Her skin shimmers in the dim light.

2600
02:42:35,770 --> 02:42:39,549
There is magic at work.

2601
02:42:39,549 --> 02:42:44,180
All right, um, I don't know.

2602
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:48,979
I feel like waiting is a bad idea, but so is this one.

2603
02:42:48,979 --> 02:42:54,620
And this is probably the worst idea.

2604
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:58,579
Maybe slip?

2605
02:42:58,579 --> 02:43:02,379
All right, I'm gonna wait, and then I'm gonna slip.

2606
02:43:02,379 --> 02:43:05,020
You continue hiding, waiting for the moment to strike.

2607
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:07,659
The guards blunder through the warehouse,

2608
02:43:07,659 --> 02:43:09,819
walking down corridors of crates.

2609
02:43:09,819 --> 02:43:11,139
They penetrate deeper into the warehouse,

2610
02:43:11,139 --> 02:43:14,959
leaving the captain alone at the threshold.

2611
02:43:14,959 --> 02:43:17,120
Hunt down the guards.

2612
02:43:17,159 --> 02:43:24,479
Okay, uh-huh.

2613
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:28,969
Should I do that?

2614
02:43:28,969 --> 02:43:30,670
That's a blunder move.

2615
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:33,180
That kind of is a blunder.

2616
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:36,479
Yeah, I'm leaving.

2617
02:43:36,479 --> 02:43:37,879
With the two guards now far away,

2618
02:43:37,879 --> 02:43:40,340
you're able to sneak towards the exit.

2619
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:43,180
You creep past crates until you are a short distance away

2620
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:44,959
from the captain in the doorway.

2621
02:43:44,959 --> 02:43:47,809
Her skin is still shimmering in the light.

2622
02:43:47,809 --> 02:43:51,229
Find anything, she shouts.

2623
02:43:51,229 --> 02:43:54,829
Not yet, comes a voice from the back of the warehouse.

2624
02:43:54,829 --> 02:44:02,200
Just charge her.

2625
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,260
Turn this down a little.

2626
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:07,860
All right, uh, law, they're intelligent.

2627
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:11,649
They're not non-intelligent.

2628
02:44:11,649 --> 02:44:15,940
Her, I can't cast it because I don't know it.

2629
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:18,190
Jig is easy here.

2630
02:44:18,190 --> 02:44:21,959
It's always funny.

2631
02:44:21,959 --> 02:44:28,500
Zap is always here.

2632
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,920
Uh, I could fart.

2633
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:33,180
I could make the whole room smell.

2634
02:44:33,180 --> 02:44:36,719
That's comedy right there too.

2635
02:44:36,719 --> 02:44:42,389
Do we want to do the comedy spells or the damage spells?

2636
02:44:45,459 --> 02:44:47,139
I feel like I never have a playthrough with this,

2637
02:44:47,139 --> 02:44:52,299
so I'm gonna do it.

2638
02:44:52,299 --> 02:44:54,659
You grab your nose plugs and stick them into your nostrils

2639
02:44:54,659 --> 02:44:56,219
before casting the spell.

2640
02:44:56,219 --> 02:44:58,780
A terrible odor begins to blossom from your sleeves

2641
02:44:58,780 --> 02:45:00,719
in a choking cloud.

2642
02:45:00,719 --> 02:45:02,280
The smell tickles your nostrils,

2643
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,870
but does nothing to the captain.

2644
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:06,950
She's not wearing nose plugs that you can see,

2645
02:45:06,950 --> 02:45:09,780
so how can this be?

2646
02:45:09,780 --> 02:45:11,219
The captain peers into the gloom

2647
02:45:11,219 --> 02:45:15,159
and then smiles as she spots you.

2648
02:45:15,159 --> 02:45:17,379
There you are.

2649
02:45:17,379 --> 02:45:20,940
Oh, I just made myself really smelly.

2650
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:35,299
Uh, well, for old time's sake, let's zap.

2651
02:45:35,299 --> 02:45:37,340
You spin the constellations into shape around you,

2652
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:40,290
winding a powerful electric force in your hand,

2653
02:45:40,290 --> 02:45:43,829
but the bolt simply vanishes upon touching the captain.

2654
02:45:43,829 --> 02:45:47,510
She laughs at your attempts, hefting her blade.

2655
02:45:47,510 --> 02:45:51,340
It seems she is protected from magic somehow.

2656
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:54,629
The captain laughs at your spell casting.

2657
02:45:54,629 --> 02:45:56,729
You think I am not prepared?

2658
02:45:56,729 --> 02:46:00,159
I'm a much stronger sorcerer than you.

2659
02:46:00,159 --> 02:46:03,760
The shimmer around her is an effect you have seen before.

2660
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:06,540
Not a force field though, not that.

2661
02:46:06,540 --> 02:46:10,649
The captain watches you with something close to amusement.

2662
02:46:10,649 --> 02:46:17,799
Um, so what's going on with her?

2663
02:46:17,799 --> 02:46:20,680
So I have to counter it.

2664
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:21,760
Shield?

2665
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:29,159
It's not a shield though.

2666
02:46:29,159 --> 02:46:58,819
Um, I'm not sure I can do anything here.

2667
02:46:58,819 --> 02:47:00,790
I don't think there's a mini-mite here.

2668
02:47:00,790 --> 02:47:10,450
Um, is it walk?

2669
02:47:10,450 --> 02:47:14,790
Check the spell book.

2670
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:16,659
Oh, here we go.

2671
02:47:16,659 --> 02:47:17,579
Not zen.

2672
02:47:19,100 --> 02:47:24,360
Not dock.

2673
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:29,479
Not giant.

2674
02:47:29,479 --> 02:47:30,559
Counter's gack.

2675
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:34,049
Not blue.

2676
02:47:34,049 --> 02:47:40,920
Wait, no, gack is, yeah, gack is blue.

2677
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,819
Big.

2678
02:47:42,819 --> 02:47:47,809
Not fix.

2679
02:47:47,809 --> 02:47:58,739
No.

2680
02:47:58,739 --> 02:48:08,200
So what spell is she using?

2681
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:09,360
She's using mag.

2682
02:48:11,049 --> 02:48:11,889
That's what it sounds like,

2683
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:14,129
didn't she say this wasn't a shield?

2684
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,959
It's not a force field.

2685
02:48:19,959 --> 02:48:22,600
Okay, so, but it's a magic force field.

2686
02:48:22,600 --> 02:48:27,729
Do I, I don't think I can cast anything that counters it.

2687
02:48:27,729 --> 02:48:33,819
I could just attack.

2688
02:48:33,819 --> 02:48:36,030
Is it a projection?

2689
02:48:36,030 --> 02:48:38,700
Mag has a counter.

2690
02:48:38,700 --> 02:48:43,600
I don't think I learned it though.

2691
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:47,049
And I think you need to have learned it for it to work.

2692
02:48:47,049 --> 02:48:52,569
Someone's gonna play the flute.

2693
02:48:52,569 --> 02:49:02,469
Uh, what else can I do?

2694
02:49:02,469 --> 02:49:06,319
I'm casting this, I don't even know what it is.

2695
02:49:06,319 --> 02:49:09,840
Cast the spell and a bounty of cats appears from somewhere.

2696
02:49:10,520 --> 02:49:11,399
They scramble all over the crates,

2697
02:49:11,399 --> 02:49:14,500
meowing in a rowdy chorus.

2698
02:49:14,500 --> 02:49:16,540
Is that the best you can do?

2699
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:18,620
The captain finally steps forward, blade in hand.

2700
02:49:18,620 --> 02:49:20,700
Okay, I didn't do anything.

2701
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:22,379
We're going full blast.

2702
02:49:22,379 --> 02:49:23,379
And it was a great call.

2703
02:49:23,379 --> 02:49:24,940
That's four damage.

2704
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:27,059
And I'm going forward again.

2705
02:49:27,059 --> 02:49:28,809
I don't even need to look.

2706
02:49:28,809 --> 02:49:31,690
That's what we call horse shit in the industry.

2707
02:49:31,690 --> 02:49:35,780
That's what we call horse shit in this fucking industry.

2708
02:49:35,780 --> 02:49:36,700
Okay.

2709
02:49:36,700 --> 02:49:39,590
The captain gives you two quick jabs.

2710
02:49:39,590 --> 02:49:41,950
Wheedling around your weapon, you stagger backwards,

2711
02:49:41,989 --> 02:49:47,680
clutching at a bleeding wound.

2712
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:50,309
I made up for it.

2713
02:49:50,309 --> 02:49:52,819
Okay, captain steps back.

2714
02:49:52,819 --> 02:49:55,559
I'm gonna def...

2715
02:49:55,559 --> 02:49:56,399
Mm.

2716
02:49:56,399 --> 02:49:58,809
Okay.

2717
02:49:58,809 --> 02:50:01,459
I feel like I could do that again.

2718
02:50:01,459 --> 02:50:03,500
Oh, fuck you.

2719
02:50:03,500 --> 02:50:04,340
Where'd you get that?

2720
02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:06,809
You've been doing moves the whole, whatever.

2721
02:50:06,809 --> 02:50:11,530
Again.

2722
02:50:11,530 --> 02:50:14,079
I'm being so greedy.

2723
02:50:14,079 --> 02:50:14,920
And look at that.

2724
02:50:14,920 --> 02:50:15,760
Look at that.

2725
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:16,600
Look at that.

2726
02:50:16,600 --> 02:50:18,639
That's so stupid.

2727
02:50:18,639 --> 02:50:20,739
Actually stupid.

2728
02:50:20,739 --> 02:50:21,579
I lost so much health.

2729
02:50:21,579 --> 02:50:30,340
I wanna do it again.

2730
02:50:30,340 --> 02:50:31,180
Okay.

2731
02:50:31,180 --> 02:50:32,670
It's not again.

2732
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:33,510
Yep.

2733
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:36,600
This time you do 3.2 instead of 4.6.

2734
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:38,040
Okay.

2735
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:38,879
She steps back.

2736
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:43,780
I'm gonna full blast it again.

2737
02:50:43,780 --> 02:50:44,860
Struggles to hide the pain.

2738
02:50:44,860 --> 02:50:46,059
She keeps an eye out.

2739
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:54,129
Yeah.

2740
02:50:54,129 --> 02:50:58,659
I think it's full blast again.

2741
02:50:58,659 --> 02:50:59,500
Shifts away.

2742
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:00,340
It's okay.

2743
02:51:01,579 --> 02:51:03,420
I'm gonna defend.

2744
02:51:03,420 --> 02:51:08,500
Full blast again and we win the game.

2745
02:51:08,500 --> 02:51:11,149
See you later.

2746
02:51:11,149 --> 02:51:11,989
Okay.

2747
02:51:11,989 --> 02:51:16,219
You thrust your blade through her neck and she falls.

2748
02:51:16,219 --> 02:51:17,659
The captain may be dead,

2749
02:51:17,659 --> 02:51:21,100
but the remaining guards burst out ready to avenge her.

2750
02:51:21,100 --> 02:51:24,719
You only have just enough time to flee the warehouse.

2751
02:51:24,719 --> 02:51:27,739
Get the hell out of here.

2752
02:51:28,379 --> 02:51:29,819
You race out of the warehouse and up the road,

2753
02:51:29,819 --> 02:51:30,860
managing to keep the...

2754
02:51:30,860 --> 02:51:31,700
You're ahead of them.

2755
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:37,180
You got ahead of the guards.

2756
02:51:37,180 --> 02:51:41,379
Let's go this way.

2757
02:51:41,379 --> 02:51:42,739
You pick your way through broken buildings

2758
02:51:42,739 --> 02:51:45,020
and through the wreckage of fallen homes.

2759
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:47,340
It seems the city once housed a lot more people

2760
02:51:47,340 --> 02:51:48,850
than it does now.

2761
02:51:48,850 --> 02:51:51,590
Perhaps its life is simply ebbing away.

2762
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:52,430
Across the ruins,

2763
02:51:52,430 --> 02:51:55,110
you can make out the stalls and tents of the bustling market.

2764
02:51:55,110 --> 02:51:59,540
The sun is beginning to lower and the air begins to cool.

2765
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:00,860
We already went to the market.

2766
02:52:00,860 --> 02:52:02,190
So we're...

2767
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:06,340
I'm not gonna run back into them, am I?

2768
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:07,549
No.

2769
02:52:07,549 --> 02:52:10,799
I can go back in the warehouse.

2770
02:52:10,799 --> 02:52:16,930
It's foolish.

2771
02:52:16,930 --> 02:52:18,170
I do have 90...

2772
02:52:18,170 --> 02:52:19,569
Hold on a second.

2773
02:52:19,569 --> 02:52:26,739
I have 97 gold.

2774
02:52:26,739 --> 02:52:28,299
Wasn't there something I could buy at the market

2775
02:52:28,299 --> 02:52:31,500
that I couldn't afford before?

2776
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:36,739
I don't think they sell food at the market.

2777
02:52:36,739 --> 02:52:38,879
Oh, I could get the mirror.

2778
02:52:38,879 --> 02:52:40,360
Yeah, we're gonna...

2779
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:44,750
Let's go back to the market.

2780
02:52:44,750 --> 02:52:46,350
If I can buy that mirror, I want it.

2781
02:52:46,350 --> 02:52:47,989
Because that lets me do what exactly?

2782
02:52:47,989 --> 02:52:54,639
Let's see.

2783
02:52:54,639 --> 02:52:56,459
I can do kin.

2784
02:52:56,459 --> 02:52:58,659
In battle, a gold-backed mirror must be pointed

2785
02:52:58,659 --> 02:53:00,739
at a creature when this spell is cast.

2786
02:53:00,739 --> 02:53:04,379
An exact replica of the enemy will then be created

2787
02:53:04,379 --> 02:53:06,059
under the caster's control.

2788
02:53:06,059 --> 02:53:10,819
However, should either creature die, both will disappear.

2789
02:53:10,819 --> 02:53:12,639
I think that's worth it.

2790
02:53:12,639 --> 02:53:15,180
That's amazing.

2791
02:53:15,180 --> 02:53:17,020
Yeah, it's like 40 gold.

2792
02:53:17,020 --> 02:53:17,860
I can afford it.

2793
02:53:17,860 --> 02:53:23,680
I'm gonna get it.

2794
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,750
Whoa, where did we just go?

2795
02:53:29,100 --> 02:53:34,809
It's up here in the stalls.

2796
02:53:34,809 --> 02:53:38,000
Peddler.

2797
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:39,579
All right, I'm back.

2798
02:53:39,579 --> 02:53:41,600
I want that mirror.

2799
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:43,079
48 gold pieces.

2800
02:53:43,079 --> 02:53:45,040
This is so annoying that I have to pay that much,

2801
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:47,450
but I want this.

2802
02:53:47,450 --> 02:53:50,860
And do I have glue?

2803
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:51,700
No, no, no, no.

2804
02:53:51,700 --> 02:53:56,420
That's not...

2805
02:53:56,420 --> 02:53:57,260
I'm done.

2806
02:53:57,260 --> 02:54:01,329
And I'll get the cutlass.

2807
02:54:01,370 --> 02:54:02,250
What do you have?

2808
02:54:07,159 --> 02:54:08,719
I will take the broadsword.

2809
02:54:08,719 --> 02:54:13,200
I don't want that.

2810
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:19,459
You already sold it.

2811
02:54:19,459 --> 02:54:25,190
It doesn't have it anymore.

2812
02:54:25,190 --> 02:54:30,250
Well, that's not good.

2813
02:54:30,250 --> 02:54:35,379
Okay, well, let's go this way.

2814
02:54:35,379 --> 02:54:39,229
Which way now?

2815
02:54:40,510 --> 02:54:44,459
We've been here.

2816
02:54:44,459 --> 02:54:47,620
We've seen most of this part of the city.

2817
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:50,399
We have the right side here that we haven't done.

2818
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:54,780
We have in here that we haven't done.

2819
02:54:54,780 --> 02:54:57,559
And this is going through the front door

2820
02:54:57,559 --> 02:54:59,700
where the archmage is.

2821
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:00,899
Didn't do this over here.

2822
02:55:00,899 --> 02:55:03,469
There's still a lot over here as well.

2823
02:55:03,469 --> 02:55:20,120
I'm going to complete the Western side.

2824
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:24,399
The monastery is closed.

2825
02:55:24,399 --> 02:55:25,680
Need to get food.

2826
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:27,750
I don't think anybody sells it.

2827
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:31,250
At least not right over here.

2828
02:55:31,250 --> 02:55:36,459
I have a blimberry potion though, don't I?

2829
02:55:36,459 --> 02:55:37,860
All right, we're not going to get trapped over there.

2830
02:55:37,860 --> 02:55:41,409
We're going to go this way.

2831
02:55:41,409 --> 02:55:43,329
The road leads away towards a ruined portion

2832
02:55:43,329 --> 02:55:44,250
of the citadel.

2833
02:55:44,250 --> 02:55:45,930
The night air is cold.

2834
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,700
Okay.

2835
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:50,020
I do remember these.

2836
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:52,440
These are interesting.

2837
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:56,670
I'm not going to spoil it, but they're very fun.

2838
02:55:56,670 --> 02:56:00,110
The road ends in a tall wall of obsidian black bricks,

2839
02:56:00,110 --> 02:56:02,219
tall enough to keep out a giant.

2840
02:56:02,219 --> 02:56:03,579
But the wall has crumbled,

2841
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:05,659
brought down by the piercing gripweed vines

2842
02:56:05,659 --> 02:56:07,399
that cover its length.

2843
02:56:07,399 --> 02:56:09,280
You could scramble over the fallen stones

2844
02:56:09,280 --> 02:56:12,260
and inside easily enough.

2845
02:56:12,260 --> 02:56:15,979
Cold night lingers on.

2846
02:56:15,979 --> 02:56:18,139
You scramble up onto a block and peer over the wall.

2847
02:56:18,139 --> 02:56:20,819
Beyond stretches an empty region of lapping water

2848
02:56:20,819 --> 02:56:24,059
from which tall, isolated, gloomy towers rise.

2849
02:56:24,059 --> 02:56:29,020
Strange noises reach you from across the wall.

2850
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:32,790
We're going.

2851
02:56:32,790 --> 02:56:34,389
You scramble up and over the broken wall

2852
02:56:34,389 --> 02:56:38,700
into a narrow strand of stone on the edge of a watery pool.

2853
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:43,440
Towers rise on all sides, connected by spidery paths.

2854
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:47,610
Sand is scattered over the edge of the pool.

2855
02:56:47,610 --> 02:56:48,450
It's free sand.

2856
02:56:48,450 --> 02:56:50,549
I'll take it.

2857
02:56:50,549 --> 02:56:53,899
Oh God, what'd I do?

2858
02:56:53,899 --> 02:56:56,139
You scoop up a couple of handfuls of usable sand.

2859
02:56:56,139 --> 02:57:04,459
The path between the towers awaits.

2860
02:57:04,459 --> 02:57:05,620
You leave the shade of the wall

2861
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:08,260
and follow the stepping stones out across the water.

2862
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:12,059
Everywhere the signs of ruin abound.

2863
02:57:12,059 --> 02:57:13,500
Weeds crack the stones,

2864
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:16,840
turret roofs and buttresses have collapsed into heaps.

2865
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:19,370
Why has the Archmage allowed such ruin?

2866
02:57:19,370 --> 02:57:22,489
Surely the rumors of his death cannot be true.

2867
02:57:22,489 --> 02:57:24,010
What is this place?

2868
02:57:24,010 --> 02:57:26,329
It looks like no part of Mampang you've yet encountered.

2869
02:57:26,329 --> 02:57:33,069
The air itself is somehow different.

2870
02:57:33,069 --> 02:57:35,430
There is a tension here.

2871
02:57:35,430 --> 02:57:37,790
The air itself feels tightened,

2872
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:40,229
as though the world is stretched thin here.

2873
02:57:40,229 --> 02:57:44,430
A taut drum skin pulled over a too wide a frame.

2874
02:57:44,430 --> 02:57:46,670
It feels as though the tiniest step

2875
02:57:46,670 --> 02:57:50,379
might unleash a powerful rupture.

2876
02:57:50,379 --> 02:57:52,459
Look at the stars.

2877
02:57:52,459 --> 02:57:55,059
You look up for the stars, but can't find anything.

2878
02:57:55,059 --> 02:57:57,379
The starlight seems to bend and divert

2879
02:57:57,379 --> 02:57:59,139
before it can reach you,

2880
02:57:59,139 --> 02:58:00,899
as though it's being funneled away.

2881
02:58:00,899 --> 02:58:03,159
What is happening in this place?

2882
02:58:03,159 --> 02:58:04,840
The path splits here,

2883
02:58:04,840 --> 02:58:06,840
with the shortest way leading up to an arch doorway

2884
02:58:06,840 --> 02:58:10,579
in a nearby tower.

2885
02:58:10,579 --> 02:58:12,610
Okay, what's in that tower?

2886
02:58:12,610 --> 02:58:14,739
You look over at the nearby tower.

2887
02:58:14,739 --> 02:58:17,340
It is squat and ugly,

2888
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:22,850
with a low, slightly squalid archway leading inside.

2889
02:58:22,850 --> 02:58:25,319
I'm gonna sleep here.

2890
02:58:25,319 --> 02:58:27,719
Putting down your pack, you try to rest despite the cold.

2891
02:58:27,719 --> 02:58:29,479
You have eaten nothing today,

2892
02:58:29,479 --> 02:58:30,680
but you have no provisions,

2893
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:36,250
only two vials of blimberry juice.

2894
02:58:36,250 --> 02:58:38,010
I will take a blimberry potion.

2895
02:58:39,700 --> 02:58:40,780
You gulp down a mouthful.

2896
02:58:40,780 --> 02:58:42,379
You feel somewhat improved,

2897
02:58:42,379 --> 02:58:44,219
and your hunger is abated.

2898
02:58:44,219 --> 02:58:46,760
Then you get comfortable and rest.

2899
02:58:46,760 --> 02:58:47,920
You roll over, trying to sleep,

2900
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:49,799
but you cannot seem to rest.

2901
02:58:49,799 --> 02:58:51,399
After a while, you get to your feet

2902
02:58:51,399 --> 02:58:54,010
and begin to walk through the darkness.

2903
02:58:54,010 --> 02:58:55,610
Crumbling walls and broken towers

2904
02:58:55,610 --> 02:58:57,370
move past on either side.

2905
02:58:57,370 --> 02:59:00,049
You are walking past an old, crumbling building

2906
02:59:00,049 --> 02:59:04,219
when you hear voices.

2907
02:59:04,219 --> 02:59:07,469
Can you starve to death in this game?

2908
02:59:07,469 --> 02:59:09,969
I believe you can.

2909
02:59:09,969 --> 02:59:13,290
Every time you do not sleep, you,

2910
02:59:13,290 --> 02:59:14,129
if you, no, no, no,

2911
02:59:14,129 --> 02:59:16,010
every time you do not sleep after eating,

2912
02:59:16,010 --> 02:59:18,239
you have to eat.

2913
02:59:18,239 --> 02:59:19,540
Can you?

2914
02:59:19,540 --> 02:59:22,319
I'm really thinking this through here.

2915
02:59:22,319 --> 02:59:23,319
I think you can,

2916
02:59:23,319 --> 02:59:26,629
because you take like three damage if you don't eat,

2917
02:59:26,629 --> 02:59:29,100
even if you sleep.

2918
02:59:29,100 --> 02:59:29,940
You're confusing me?

2919
02:59:29,940 --> 02:59:32,139
I'm confusing myself.

2920
02:59:32,139 --> 02:59:34,139
I'm pretty certain you lose a few health

2921
02:59:34,139 --> 02:59:37,329
if you sleep without eating.

2922
02:59:37,329 --> 02:59:43,489
So eventually, yes, but you could always rewind.

2923
02:59:43,489 --> 02:59:48,989
Okay, let's listen.

2924
02:59:48,989 --> 02:59:51,270
You listen closer, leaning against the wall.

2925
02:59:51,989 --> 02:59:53,309
It sounds like a distant crowd,

2926
02:59:53,309 --> 02:59:55,989
too far even to be on the other side of the wall.

2927
02:59:55,989 --> 03:00:00,780
Where are these voices coming from?

2928
03:00:00,780 --> 03:00:02,860
Let me look over the wall.

2929
03:00:02,860 --> 03:00:05,899
Looking over the wall, you spot a missing brick.

2930
03:00:05,899 --> 03:00:08,100
A green-gray mold has covered the gap,

2931
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,399
coating the interior with fuzz.

2932
03:00:10,399 --> 03:00:13,620
Ooh, I love green mold.

2933
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:16,219
Wait, this is not the same mold.

2934
03:00:16,219 --> 03:00:17,579
As you lean down to peer at the mold,

2935
03:00:17,579 --> 03:00:22,520
you realize the voices are growing louder.

2936
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:24,370
Look at it.

2937
03:00:24,370 --> 03:00:26,409
You squint, peering at the mold.

2938
03:00:26,409 --> 03:00:28,250
It is unusually shaped,

2939
03:00:28,250 --> 03:00:30,250
buried in color with peaks and valleys.

2940
03:00:30,250 --> 03:00:32,649
Tiny bumps dot the mold,

2941
03:00:32,649 --> 03:00:36,139
along with taller outcroppings that look like spires.

2942
03:00:36,139 --> 03:00:37,700
But then something else catches your eye.

2943
03:00:37,700 --> 03:00:38,940
Movement.

2944
03:00:38,940 --> 03:00:41,579
Hundreds of tiny specks swarm across the surface

2945
03:00:41,579 --> 03:00:42,420
of the brick,

2946
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:46,100
making circuits in all directions around the mold.

2947
03:00:46,100 --> 03:00:52,700
What could they be?

2948
03:00:52,700 --> 03:00:54,750
I'm moving away.

2949
03:00:54,750 --> 03:00:57,829
You decide some mysteries are better left unexplored

2950
03:00:57,829 --> 03:00:58,670
and move on.

2951
03:00:58,670 --> 03:01:01,700
The wall is lost somewhere behind you.

2952
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:05,950
Did I just get health for that?

2953
03:01:05,950 --> 03:01:06,870
Oh, I slept.

2954
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:12,389
It was a dream.

2955
03:01:12,389 --> 03:01:16,399
I thought I was awake.

2956
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:20,120
I did, I guess I did fall asleep.

2957
03:01:20,120 --> 03:01:21,959
Okay, you gained a huge amount of gold

2958
03:01:21,959 --> 03:01:24,940
and found no new clues.

2959
03:01:24,940 --> 03:01:26,340
You pick yourself up to your feet,

2960
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:30,569
try to shake away your more curious dreams.

2961
03:01:30,569 --> 03:01:32,250
The wind picks up a little spray from the water

2962
03:01:32,250 --> 03:01:33,850
and splashes it into your face.

2963
03:01:33,850 --> 03:01:37,340
It stings where it touches you.

2964
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:41,010
How is the Archmage not aware you attacked his guards?

2965
03:01:41,010 --> 03:01:49,190
He might, pretty soon.

2966
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:51,909
You'll lean out over the path and look down into the water.

2967
03:01:51,909 --> 03:01:58,620
It is black, reflectionless, as though infinitely deep.

2968
03:01:58,620 --> 03:02:00,940
Let's drop a stone.

2969
03:02:00,940 --> 03:02:02,620
No, no, I don't want to drop one of my pebbles.

2970
03:02:02,620 --> 03:02:05,540
I want to drop pebbles on the ground.

2971
03:02:05,540 --> 03:02:07,420
God damn it.

2972
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:10,219
You drop one of your pebbles into the water.

2973
03:02:10,219 --> 03:02:13,020
It sinks without a trace and without even a ripple,

2974
03:02:13,020 --> 03:02:14,059
but you must keep moving.

2975
03:02:14,059 --> 03:02:16,290
I just wasted a spell right there.

2976
03:02:16,290 --> 03:02:20,219
That stinks.

2977
03:02:20,219 --> 03:02:21,139
Ah, there's this tower.

2978
03:02:21,139 --> 03:02:22,260
We can go around here,

2979
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:25,079
which I believe leads to these two.

2980
03:02:25,079 --> 03:02:25,959
This one, I believe,

2981
03:02:25,959 --> 03:02:29,700
let's just go in this one we're in right now.

2982
03:02:29,700 --> 03:02:30,540
We're standing right in front of it.

2983
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:33,850
Let's go inside.

2984
03:02:33,850 --> 03:02:35,969
The early morning sun makes the air glow.

2985
03:02:35,969 --> 03:02:37,489
You cross the waters and push your way

2986
03:02:37,489 --> 03:02:39,290
inside the crumbling tower

2987
03:02:39,290 --> 03:02:41,750
without knowing what you might find.

2988
03:02:41,750 --> 03:02:45,299
Once inside, you immediately break out into a smile.

2989
03:02:45,299 --> 03:02:46,379
This tower might be gloomy,

2990
03:02:46,379 --> 03:02:49,909
but it's certainly a relief after the ruin outside.

2991
03:02:49,909 --> 03:02:51,989
So nice in here.

2992
03:02:51,989 --> 03:02:53,370
Look around.

2993
03:02:53,370 --> 03:02:55,750
You have a quick peek around the room,

2994
03:02:55,750 --> 03:02:58,370
this way and that, this way, that way.

2995
03:02:58,370 --> 03:03:00,149
It is curiously dark.

2996
03:03:00,149 --> 03:03:01,709
You pay special attention to the corners,

2997
03:03:01,709 --> 03:03:03,389
hoping to find something interesting,

2998
03:03:03,389 --> 03:03:08,430
a colorful spider maybe, or some nice juicy moss.

2999
03:03:08,430 --> 03:03:09,799
You don't see anything.

3000
03:03:09,799 --> 03:03:13,639
And after a while, start to feel a bit let down.

3001
03:03:13,639 --> 03:03:17,110
The atmosphere of this place seems genuinely good for you.

3002
03:03:17,110 --> 03:03:23,579
What a charming place.

3003
03:03:23,579 --> 03:03:25,770
Look at the doors.

3004
03:03:25,770 --> 03:03:26,969
You look over at the doors.

3005
03:03:26,969 --> 03:03:29,350
There's one behind you and one in front of you.

3006
03:03:29,350 --> 03:03:30,670
But when you try to count them,

3007
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:34,379
you find you can't quite manage it.

3008
03:03:34,379 --> 03:03:36,420
It's probably because turning to look at one

3009
03:03:36,420 --> 03:03:38,590
means the other one is behind,

3010
03:03:38,590 --> 03:03:40,459
so you can't see it anymore.

3011
03:03:40,459 --> 03:03:42,819
And you can hardly count something you can't see,

3012
03:03:42,819 --> 03:03:44,829
after all.

3013
03:03:44,829 --> 03:03:47,829
What?

3014
03:03:47,829 --> 03:03:50,870
Eventually you decide there are most likely two doors here,

3015
03:03:50,870 --> 03:03:54,420
even if you can't really be certain.

3016
03:03:54,420 --> 03:03:55,739
You open your arms to cast a spell

3017
03:03:55,739 --> 03:03:57,299
and end up falling over backwards

3018
03:03:57,299 --> 03:03:59,670
and collapsing into giggles.

3019
03:03:59,670 --> 03:04:01,190
Such a shame there's no one here

3020
03:04:01,190 --> 03:04:02,309
to enjoy this place with you.

3021
03:04:02,309 --> 03:04:06,459
It really is quite delightful.

3022
03:04:06,459 --> 03:04:11,239
Uh-oh, sit down.

3023
03:04:11,239 --> 03:04:15,459
You drop down onto all fours quite merrily.

3024
03:04:15,459 --> 03:04:17,739
This is no kind of place to sleep,

3025
03:04:17,739 --> 03:04:20,409
but it's a great place to cross your legs.

3026
03:04:20,409 --> 03:04:23,149
You try crossing them one way and then the other,

3027
03:04:23,149 --> 03:04:25,909
but neither way is really comfortable.

3028
03:04:25,909 --> 03:04:28,590
You're forced to stand up once more.

3029
03:04:28,590 --> 03:04:36,559
Clearly there's something wrong with the floor.

3030
03:04:36,559 --> 03:04:38,540
You pause where you stand

3031
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:42,030
to regard the cracks in the flagstones underfoot.

3032
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:43,510
You trace them this way and that.

3033
03:04:43,510 --> 03:04:46,579
They form loops, branch, and then rejoin.

3034
03:04:46,579 --> 03:04:48,219
It is, you realize after some time,

3035
03:04:48,219 --> 03:04:52,360
almost as though all the stones fit together.

3036
03:04:52,360 --> 03:04:53,709
Wow.

3037
03:04:53,709 --> 03:04:55,510
After tracing a crack for several minutes

3038
03:04:55,510 --> 03:04:57,670
only to have it disappear under your own boot,

3039
03:04:57,670 --> 03:05:01,670
you look up once more.

3040
03:05:01,670 --> 03:05:03,030
You head for the door,

3041
03:05:03,030 --> 03:05:04,149
but get distracted by the way

3042
03:05:04,149 --> 03:05:08,229
the view of the world outside moves left and right a little.

3043
03:05:08,229 --> 03:05:09,989
As you sway from side to side,

3044
03:05:09,989 --> 03:05:15,270
you are soon standing on the spot and just swaying.

3045
03:05:15,270 --> 03:05:20,879
I think I'm fucked up right now.

3046
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:24,120
I don't have a god to pray to.

3047
03:05:24,120 --> 03:05:27,489
I'm just gonna leave?

3048
03:05:27,489 --> 03:05:29,260
Why would you leave?

3049
03:05:29,260 --> 03:05:31,979
This empty chamber is fascinating.

3050
03:05:31,979 --> 03:05:33,899
You turn around on the spot a few times

3051
03:05:33,899 --> 03:05:40,639
to get a full view and fall over, pray.

3052
03:05:40,639 --> 03:05:43,120
You close your eyes and attempt to offer a prayer,

3053
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:47,379
but end up singing a song from your childhood instead.

3054
03:05:47,379 --> 03:05:50,420
Five sight masters wearing spiky hats.

3055
03:05:50,420 --> 03:05:52,579
The song brings a smile to your face

3056
03:05:52,579 --> 03:05:57,120
and it must be said, a tear to your eye.

3057
03:05:57,120 --> 03:05:59,040
You have another try for the far door,

3058
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:01,719
though you are by now turned around enough

3059
03:06:01,719 --> 03:06:04,450
that you can't really be sure which door is which.

3060
03:06:04,450 --> 03:06:05,450
Stepping out into the open,

3061
03:06:05,450 --> 03:06:07,540
you feel a slight headache coming on,

3062
03:06:07,540 --> 03:06:15,590
as though you had drunk too much ale.

3063
03:06:15,590 --> 03:06:19,860
Let's go this way.

3064
03:06:19,860 --> 03:06:24,969
Is this the weed room?

3065
03:06:24,969 --> 03:06:28,920
I don't know what that was.

3066
03:06:28,920 --> 03:06:30,579
Okay, next room.

3067
03:06:30,579 --> 03:06:33,610
You step back out onto the path and follow it a short way.

3068
03:06:33,610 --> 03:06:35,370
Three paths meet at this point

3069
03:06:35,370 --> 03:06:37,309
in the shadow of the eastern rock.

3070
03:06:37,309 --> 03:06:38,149
From the eastern tower,

3071
03:06:38,149 --> 03:06:40,409
you hear the faintest sound of music.

3072
03:06:40,409 --> 03:06:43,370
The air seems to fizz and crackle with secret energy.

3073
03:06:43,370 --> 03:06:47,540
Which way now?

3074
03:06:47,540 --> 03:06:52,860
The eastmost one sounds like music.

3075
03:06:52,860 --> 03:06:54,659
Music in here?

3076
03:06:54,659 --> 03:06:57,040
I don't know what's in here.

3077
03:06:57,040 --> 03:07:06,930
I'm gonna say maybe the one right next to me.

3078
03:07:06,930 --> 03:07:10,069
Oh, that's not good.

3079
03:07:10,069 --> 03:07:12,889
The air moves a little around you, still icy but fresh.

3080
03:07:12,889 --> 03:07:15,489
You enter the next tower nervously.

3081
03:07:15,489 --> 03:07:18,409
This chamber is large, circular,

3082
03:07:18,409 --> 03:07:21,280
and peppered with dark alcoves.

3083
03:07:21,280 --> 03:07:26,780
The floor is pure marble, as are the walls.

3084
03:07:26,780 --> 03:07:28,620
In the center, standing on a pedestal of rough stone,

3085
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:31,780
is a large stone sculpture of a ram.

3086
03:07:31,780 --> 03:07:39,299
Ooh, study the statue.

3087
03:07:39,299 --> 03:07:41,540
You pause to admire the statue.

3088
03:07:41,540 --> 03:07:42,899
It is about twice your height,

3089
03:07:42,899 --> 03:07:45,309
cut smoothly into the glossy rock.

3090
03:07:45,309 --> 03:07:46,909
The craftsmanship is impressive.

3091
03:07:46,909 --> 03:07:49,579
Sculpted fur that looks soft enough to touch.

3092
03:07:49,579 --> 03:07:51,420
There's only one flaw.

3093
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:56,200
The eyes lack pupils and are instead solid white orbs.

3094
03:07:56,200 --> 03:07:57,200
You cannot shake the feeling

3095
03:07:57,200 --> 03:08:03,020
that the statue is looking at you.

3096
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:05,170
Look around the room.

3097
03:08:05,170 --> 03:08:06,540
You scan the room.

3098
03:08:06,540 --> 03:08:07,500
Nothing moves,

3099
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:11,079
but the darkness in the alcoves might hide something.

3100
03:08:11,079 --> 03:08:12,959
Across the room is a set of double doors,

3101
03:08:12,959 --> 03:08:15,909
large enough that three ogres could walk through.

3102
03:08:15,909 --> 03:08:17,590
Another doorway leads north,

3103
03:08:17,590 --> 03:08:27,780
but the path in that direction has crumbled into ruin.

3104
03:08:27,780 --> 03:08:32,079
I could turn back to.

3105
03:08:32,079 --> 03:08:34,579
I'm gonna look at the walls.

3106
03:08:34,579 --> 03:08:36,860
The marble covering the walls and floors is quite exquisite,

3107
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:40,190
but peering closer, you notice splintering cracks.

3108
03:08:40,190 --> 03:08:43,250
What would have caused such damage?

3109
03:08:43,250 --> 03:08:47,479
Just then, the statue behind you moves.

3110
03:08:47,479 --> 03:08:49,559
It does?

3111
03:08:49,559 --> 03:08:53,000
Its marble body groans with strain

3112
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,350
as its head lifts to face you.

3113
03:08:55,350 --> 03:08:57,950
It shakes itself, the stone flaking.

3114
03:08:57,950 --> 03:09:00,409
Two blank eyes stare you down.

3115
03:09:00,409 --> 03:09:03,610
It jerks and twitches as it raises a leg.

3116
03:09:03,610 --> 03:09:07,370
It brings a hoof down onto the stone.

3117
03:09:07,370 --> 03:09:08,639
Boom!

3118
03:09:08,639 --> 03:09:11,719
They do exist.

3119
03:09:11,719 --> 03:09:15,069
The air shudders with the force of a single step.

3120
03:09:15,069 --> 03:09:16,409
Boom!

3121
03:09:16,409 --> 03:09:18,370
The ram descends from the pedestal,

3122
03:09:18,370 --> 03:09:21,040
never taking its eyes from you.

3123
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:26,040
Before you stands one of the archmage's deadliest servants,

3124
03:09:27,280 --> 03:09:31,959
one of us, the sleepless ram.

3125
03:09:31,959 --> 03:09:33,600
You shift your weight, ready to leap out or attack,

3126
03:09:33,600 --> 03:09:37,420
but the ram simply stares, unblinking and unmoving.

3127
03:09:37,420 --> 03:09:40,440
Then it takes one more halting step,

3128
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:44,379
lowers its head and begins to charge.

3129
03:09:44,379 --> 03:09:50,500
There is no time for any singing.

3130
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:54,430
Why would I be singing?

3131
03:09:54,430 --> 03:09:58,819
Just in case you know, there's no time for that.

3132
03:09:58,819 --> 03:10:02,290
Wait for it.

3133
03:10:02,290 --> 03:10:03,819
Should I just get hit by it?

3134
03:10:03,819 --> 03:10:05,469
Wait for it.

3135
03:10:05,469 --> 03:10:09,020
You hold your nerve as the creature pounds closer.

3136
03:10:09,020 --> 03:10:10,340
Jump onto its back.

3137
03:10:10,340 --> 03:10:13,920
That's kind of cool.

3138
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:15,879
You had a clue about this guy.

3139
03:10:15,879 --> 03:10:18,760
Ooh, I think you're right.

3140
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:23,239
I actually think you're right.

3141
03:10:23,239 --> 03:10:29,690
Oh shit, right here.

3142
03:10:29,690 --> 03:10:35,170
Should have read my notes before going in the room.

3143
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:37,500
You can sing it to sleep.

3144
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:40,969
Uh, whoops.

3145
03:10:40,969 --> 03:10:44,010
I'm gonna jump onto its back.

3146
03:10:44,010 --> 03:10:46,659
You grab and leap onto the creature's back,

3147
03:10:46,659 --> 03:10:50,569
hoping to settle into place, but it's a hopeless cause.

3148
03:10:50,569 --> 03:10:53,430
Instead, you vault clean over the ram,

3149
03:10:53,430 --> 03:10:58,209
but it turns on a pinhead, rears and slams you down

3150
03:10:58,209 --> 03:11:00,350
with both hooves.

3151
03:11:00,350 --> 03:11:03,270
Despite its jerky, unnatural movements,

3152
03:11:03,270 --> 03:11:05,399
the ram is incredibly fast.

3153
03:11:05,399 --> 03:11:07,920
You spin in the air before bouncing off the ground.

3154
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:09,200
Dazed on the ground,

3155
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:13,510
you hear the thunderous steps as the creature turns.

3156
03:11:13,510 --> 03:11:15,569
Oh God.

3157
03:11:15,569 --> 03:11:17,700
Uh, look around.

3158
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:21,059
You look around just as the ram barrels into you once more.

3159
03:11:21,059 --> 03:11:23,020
Caught by its horns,

3160
03:11:23,020 --> 03:11:25,540
you are carried bodily across the room

3161
03:11:25,540 --> 03:11:27,899
until the creature slams you into the wall.

3162
03:11:27,899 --> 03:11:31,459
Smash, brush.

3163
03:11:31,459 --> 03:11:33,180
The marble cracks under the blow

3164
03:11:33,180 --> 03:11:36,500
and you slide onto the ground, barely able to breathe.

3165
03:11:36,500 --> 03:11:40,559
The thing backs off a short way, readying another charge.

3166
03:11:40,559 --> 03:11:42,020
Get up.

3167
03:11:42,020 --> 03:11:43,750
You get to your feet, nauseous.

3168
03:11:45,020 --> 03:11:47,139
By simply entering this room, you have sealed your fate.

3169
03:11:47,139 --> 03:11:51,979
This is now a fight for your life.

3170
03:11:51,979 --> 03:11:55,379
Sing to it.

3171
03:11:55,379 --> 03:11:57,750
You know the ram can be sung to sleep,

3172
03:11:57,750 --> 03:11:58,989
but as you ready yourself to try,

3173
03:11:58,989 --> 03:12:04,229
you realize Dintantia never mentioned what song to sing.

3174
03:12:04,309 --> 03:12:07,719
Perhaps it is just music in general.

3175
03:12:07,719 --> 03:12:08,760
Uh,

3176
03:12:08,760 --> 03:12:11,969
Strawberries fields.

3177
03:12:11,969 --> 03:12:14,680
Slang, oh, slang.

3178
03:12:14,680 --> 03:12:16,950
The wizard's three.

3179
03:12:16,950 --> 03:12:18,229
Oh mama.

3180
03:12:18,229 --> 03:12:22,959
Not again-a.

3181
03:12:22,959 --> 03:12:24,079
Karma.

3182
03:12:24,079 --> 03:12:24,920
Oh, oh.

3183
03:12:24,920 --> 03:12:26,899
A-O.

3184
03:12:26,899 --> 03:12:30,620
I don't know.

3185
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:31,459
Sing nothing?

3186
03:12:31,459 --> 03:12:37,659
No, I gotta sing something.

3187
03:12:37,659 --> 03:12:39,940
It probably doesn't matter.

3188
03:12:39,940 --> 03:12:40,780
Let's do the analy-

3189
03:12:41,459 --> 03:12:42,299
Yeah, I agree.

3190
03:12:42,299 --> 03:12:44,340
Analand lullaby.

3191
03:12:44,340 --> 03:12:46,139
Facing the ram, you sing a soothing lullaby

3192
03:12:46,139 --> 03:12:49,389
from your village, but the creature doesn't care.

3193
03:12:49,389 --> 03:12:51,829
For the tune and charges, it knocks you down

3194
03:12:51,829 --> 03:12:53,549
and narrowly misses crushing your skull

3195
03:12:53,549 --> 03:12:55,350
like a melon as you scramble away.

3196
03:12:57,879 --> 03:13:07,239
Um, I don't know.

3197
03:13:07,239 --> 03:13:08,379
Karima?

3198
03:13:08,379 --> 03:13:10,870
All right, Karima.

3199
03:13:10,870 --> 03:13:12,790
Voice wavering, you try to sing songs

3200
03:13:12,790 --> 03:13:16,049
half remembered from the fire pits of Kariyama.

3201
03:13:16,049 --> 03:13:17,090
The song has no effect.

3202
03:13:17,090 --> 03:13:20,870
You escape being gored by mere seconds.

3203
03:13:20,870 --> 03:13:23,430
You're beginning to feel that Dintantia

3204
03:13:23,430 --> 03:13:27,319
was lying to you.

3205
03:13:27,319 --> 03:13:29,399
The wizard's three.

3206
03:13:29,399 --> 03:13:30,360
Oh me.

3207
03:13:30,360 --> 03:13:32,639
You barely can muster the breath to sing anymore.

3208
03:13:32,639 --> 03:13:34,319
So you whisper the song you sang

3209
03:13:34,319 --> 03:13:36,879
as you climbed the steps into High Zamen.

3210
03:13:36,879 --> 03:13:38,680
But just as before, the cheerful words

3211
03:13:38,680 --> 03:13:41,590
seem foolish and quickly die in your throat.

3212
03:13:41,590 --> 03:13:44,340
The ram charges the song has not worked.

3213
03:13:44,340 --> 03:13:46,020
You are running out of songs,

3214
03:13:46,020 --> 03:13:51,590
not to mention the bravery required to sing them.

3215
03:13:51,590 --> 03:14:00,719
Oh the, oh the wizardry?

3216
03:14:00,719 --> 03:14:05,809
Can I get it wrong this many times in a row?

3217
03:14:05,809 --> 03:14:08,139
Oh mana.

3218
03:14:08,139 --> 03:14:09,020
What was it?

3219
03:14:09,020 --> 03:14:13,340
It doesn't work.

3220
03:14:13,340 --> 03:14:15,340
You sing weakly the strange wordless chant

3221
03:14:15,340 --> 03:14:19,110
you overheard in the monastery of Effe as best you can.

3222
03:14:19,110 --> 03:14:20,389
Song does not put the ram to sleep,

3223
03:14:20,389 --> 03:14:23,790
but rather causes it to charge straight at you and miss.

3224
03:14:23,790 --> 03:14:26,180
Okay, this is, I have,

3225
03:14:26,180 --> 03:14:29,590
you sing weakly the song of slang

3226
03:14:29,590 --> 03:14:31,229
chanted in the temple of Kare.

3227
03:14:31,229 --> 03:14:34,250
The ram charges once more.

3228
03:14:34,250 --> 03:14:36,110
What?

3229
03:14:36,110 --> 03:14:55,100
Why, was it, did she just make it up?

3230
03:14:55,100 --> 03:15:01,450
I'm gonna open the door behind me and run out.

3231
03:15:01,450 --> 03:15:03,370
Okay, look into the stars as you craft the magic.

3232
03:15:03,370 --> 03:15:06,399
The double doors at the end fly open,

3233
03:15:06,399 --> 03:15:09,079
then begin to fall shut once more under their own weight.

3234
03:15:09,079 --> 03:15:11,950
You cannot make it in time before they slam.

3235
03:15:11,950 --> 03:15:14,280
Oh, fuck you.

3236
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:17,030
You run, why did I not go there first?

3237
03:15:17,030 --> 03:15:19,149
You slip around the ram heading towards the double doors,

3238
03:15:19,149 --> 03:15:20,909
but it is too fast.

3239
03:15:20,909 --> 03:15:21,750
You try to avoid it,

3240
03:15:21,750 --> 03:15:24,989
but it smashes your shoulder as it rockets past.

3241
03:15:24,989 --> 03:15:30,290
This creature will charge as soon as you even blink.

3242
03:15:30,290 --> 03:15:39,540
Um, jig?

3243
03:15:39,540 --> 03:15:44,129
What do I have access to?

3244
03:15:44,129 --> 03:15:45,209
I don't have glue.

3245
03:15:47,250 --> 03:15:51,020
Uh, zap is not gonna work.

3246
03:15:51,020 --> 03:15:52,500
What about wall?

3247
03:15:52,500 --> 03:15:59,459
Oh, can't.

3248
03:15:59,459 --> 03:16:00,299
Oh, slowness?

3249
03:16:00,299 --> 03:16:02,850
I'll try it.

3250
03:16:04,239 --> 03:16:06,280
You move the starlight into order around you,

3251
03:16:06,280 --> 03:16:09,739
and it seems as if the ram is plunged into water.

3252
03:16:09,739 --> 03:16:12,659
It begins to charge and yet is hardly moving.

3253
03:16:12,659 --> 03:16:14,540
You have a few moments in which to act.

3254
03:16:14,540 --> 03:16:16,530
Open the door.

3255
03:16:16,530 --> 03:16:18,930
You tug on the far doors of the chamber,

3256
03:16:18,930 --> 03:16:21,379
but they do not budge.

3257
03:16:21,379 --> 03:16:23,819
Oh my God, I have to open this with dop.

3258
03:16:23,819 --> 03:16:40,879
I need to take a potion.

3259
03:16:40,879 --> 03:16:43,379
I think I'll get out.

3260
03:16:43,379 --> 03:16:44,659
This should fly open now.

3261
03:16:44,659 --> 03:16:50,520
Open locks and doors.

3262
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:51,360
Yes!

3263
03:16:51,360 --> 03:16:52,200
You leave the enchantment.

3264
03:16:52,200 --> 03:16:53,920
The double doors at the end fly open

3265
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:56,479
and begin to fall shut once more under their own weight.

3266
03:16:56,479 --> 03:16:58,959
You dive quickly through, gasping for air.

3267
03:16:58,959 --> 03:17:00,780
All right, I made it.

3268
03:17:00,780 --> 03:17:06,559
That was pretty rough.

3269
03:17:06,559 --> 03:17:09,219
Pretty rough.

3270
03:17:09,219 --> 03:17:13,920
So now we're on the walkway.

3271
03:17:13,920 --> 03:17:14,879
I don't know if I'm pressing a button.

3272
03:17:14,879 --> 03:17:15,719
It keeps like jumping over.

3273
03:17:15,719 --> 03:17:19,700
All right, so this is where we are now.

3274
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:24,649
Here, this leads to these ones.

3275
03:17:24,649 --> 03:17:27,459
We're on the walkway above here.

3276
03:17:27,459 --> 03:17:30,750
You stand atop a short walkway between the two towers.

3277
03:17:30,750 --> 03:17:33,309
A stone archway passage holds a doorway,

3278
03:17:33,309 --> 03:17:35,069
but the door has been bricked over.

3279
03:17:35,069 --> 03:17:39,860
The work looks shoddy and rushed.

3280
03:17:39,860 --> 03:17:44,219
Should I rest?

3281
03:17:44,219 --> 03:17:46,700
You're feeling weak, so you stop to rest and meditate.

3282
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:48,819
The middle of the day is hot.

3283
03:17:48,819 --> 03:17:50,260
Eventually you get back to your feet once more,

3284
03:17:50,260 --> 03:17:51,379
somewhat refreshed.

3285
03:17:51,379 --> 03:17:52,909
Here we go.

3286
03:17:52,909 --> 03:17:53,989
For just a moment,

3287
03:17:53,989 --> 03:17:55,350
you catch the sound of muttering

3288
03:17:55,350 --> 03:17:59,030
coming from somewhere nearby.

3289
03:17:59,030 --> 03:18:00,770
I'm gonna listen.

3290
03:18:00,770 --> 03:18:03,819
You press your ear to a gap in the mortar.

3291
03:18:03,819 --> 03:18:07,229
You hear grunting, scratching, and the tearing of flesh.

3292
03:18:07,229 --> 03:18:11,780
There is a thump as something is thrown against the wall

3293
03:18:11,780 --> 03:18:16,670
and what might be a bone snapping.

3294
03:18:16,670 --> 03:18:21,829
I don't know if I want to go in here.

3295
03:18:21,829 --> 03:18:26,459
Should I just kick it down?

3296
03:18:26,459 --> 03:18:31,739
Or do we avoid this?

3297
03:18:31,739 --> 03:18:33,569
You kick the wall.

3298
03:18:34,250 --> 03:18:35,889
It bows with the blow, mortar crumbling away.

3299
03:18:35,889 --> 03:18:39,579
It is weakened.

3300
03:18:39,579 --> 03:18:40,940
Kick the wall again.

3301
03:18:40,940 --> 03:18:41,780
You kick again.

3302
03:18:41,780 --> 03:18:42,899
The weakened wall does not crumble,

3303
03:18:42,899 --> 03:18:45,450
but you do hurt your foot.

3304
03:18:45,450 --> 03:18:47,510
Oh, please.

3305
03:18:51,540 --> 03:18:56,020
Why would I want to get in here so bad?

3306
03:18:56,020 --> 03:18:58,700
This is gonna hurt.

3307
03:18:58,700 --> 03:19:00,659
You push against the weakened spot in the wall

3308
03:19:00,659 --> 03:19:03,260
where you kicked and it gives way.

3309
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:04,659
The bricks crumble inwards,

3310
03:19:04,659 --> 03:19:06,920
leaving a choking cloud of dust.

3311
03:19:06,920 --> 03:19:07,760
A moment later,

3312
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:10,120
two goblins squeeze through the hole in the wall,

3313
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:12,280
knocking you to the ground in their haste.

3314
03:19:12,280 --> 03:19:16,610
It seems they were bricked up inside the tower.

3315
03:19:16,610 --> 03:19:18,329
All right.

3316
03:19:18,329 --> 03:19:19,969
They want to...

3317
03:19:19,969 --> 03:19:22,379
No, I'm not going in.

3318
03:19:22,379 --> 03:19:26,020
I'm not going in.

3319
03:19:26,020 --> 03:19:30,600
I'm not going in.

3320
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:32,079
They are trying to get away.

3321
03:19:32,079 --> 03:19:33,440
Why would I want to go in?

3322
03:19:44,270 --> 03:19:46,819
And he said, oh my God, you're good.

3323
03:19:46,819 --> 03:19:47,860
Fine, I'll listen to that person.

3324
03:19:47,860 --> 03:19:49,899
We'll go in.

3325
03:19:49,899 --> 03:19:51,860
Stealing your courage and with your hand at your sword hilt,

3326
03:19:51,860 --> 03:19:54,059
you step inside the foul-smelling tower.

3327
03:19:54,059 --> 03:19:54,940
What's the worst that could happen?

3328
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:56,540
Let's go in.

3329
03:19:56,540 --> 03:20:03,239
Go in the goblin room.

3330
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:04,280
You step into the chamber.

3331
03:20:04,280 --> 03:20:07,979
The smell is worse than you could have ever imagined.

3332
03:20:07,979 --> 03:20:09,260
A few of the goblins look up

3333
03:20:09,260 --> 03:20:11,420
from their rampant cannibalism

3334
03:20:11,459 --> 03:20:14,629
to stare at you with slack-jawed expressions.

3335
03:20:14,629 --> 03:20:23,100
How long have they been stuck here?

3336
03:20:23,100 --> 03:20:27,030
Jesus.

3337
03:20:27,030 --> 03:20:30,950
Well, I don't have very much power.

3338
03:20:34,180 --> 03:20:41,170
I could make a giant.

3339
03:20:41,170 --> 03:20:46,719
I could blow the gale horn.

3340
03:20:46,719 --> 03:20:53,780
I could make a shield.

3341
03:20:53,780 --> 03:21:00,829
I could create the illusion of worship.

3342
03:21:00,829 --> 03:21:04,370
Let's pretend I'm a god.

3343
03:21:04,370 --> 03:21:09,229
That might be kind of fun.

3344
03:21:09,229 --> 03:21:15,030
Should I just pretend to be god?

3345
03:21:15,030 --> 03:21:15,870
That sounds fun.

3346
03:21:15,870 --> 03:21:19,450
Yeah.

3347
03:21:19,450 --> 03:21:20,729
Consulting the constellations overhead,

3348
03:21:20,729 --> 03:21:22,809
you bind the spell and your jewel of gold

3349
03:21:22,809 --> 03:21:25,319
begins to shine in gleam.

3350
03:21:25,319 --> 03:21:27,520
The goblins nearest to you collapse to their knees,

3351
03:21:27,520 --> 03:21:29,899
wailing and supplicating.

3352
03:21:29,899 --> 03:21:34,030
With the crazed mob cowered by your spell casting,

3353
03:21:34,030 --> 03:21:38,370
you have a moment to act.

3354
03:21:38,370 --> 03:21:39,959
I'm going for the fire door.

3355
03:21:39,959 --> 03:21:42,440
You take advantage of the lull to race across the room.

3356
03:21:42,440 --> 03:21:44,500
The door to the east is closed

3357
03:21:44,500 --> 03:21:48,780
and the door in the west wall is open.

3358
03:21:48,780 --> 03:21:51,969
Okay, where are we?

3359
03:21:51,969 --> 03:21:56,180
So this one is closed.

3360
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:59,719
So this one's open.

3361
03:21:59,719 --> 03:22:01,239
All right, we're going west.

3362
03:22:01,239 --> 03:22:05,329
Wait, what?

3363
03:22:05,329 --> 03:22:09,540
Retreat.

3364
03:22:09,540 --> 03:22:10,379
I don't want to retreat.

3365
03:22:11,899 --> 03:22:17,540
Isn't that the west door?

3366
03:22:17,540 --> 03:22:18,379
You try the door.

3367
03:22:18,379 --> 03:22:19,520
It is locked.

3368
03:22:19,520 --> 03:22:21,280
Your spell will not last much longer.

3369
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:22,159
If you cannot escape,

3370
03:22:22,159 --> 03:22:27,309
you will be trapped in here with these creatures.

3371
03:22:27,309 --> 03:22:38,379
Um, do I have a key?

3372
03:22:38,379 --> 03:22:40,700
This is the key to the prison cells of Kare.

3373
03:22:40,700 --> 03:22:51,000
I don't, I don't think this is gonna work.

3374
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:52,239
You have a key.

3375
03:22:52,239 --> 03:22:55,819
You try it in the door, but it doesn't fit the lock.

3376
03:22:55,819 --> 03:22:56,659
Your spell gives out

3377
03:22:56,659 --> 03:22:59,590
and the goblins begin creeping up on you.

3378
03:22:59,590 --> 03:23:02,540
Smash the door down.

3379
03:23:02,540 --> 03:23:04,579
You charge the door with your shoulder and it shudders,

3380
03:23:04,579 --> 03:23:06,319
but it does not break.

3381
03:23:06,319 --> 03:23:07,159
Goblins leap up,

3382
03:23:07,159 --> 03:23:09,360
clutching your arms and chest in a frenzy.

3383
03:23:09,360 --> 03:23:11,840
You are brought down, rolling along the sticky floor

3384
03:23:11,840 --> 03:23:13,200
as more pile on top of you.

3385
03:23:13,200 --> 03:23:15,040
Pain flares up along your body

3386
03:23:15,040 --> 03:23:18,500
as the crazed goblins tear into your flesh.

3387
03:23:18,500 --> 03:23:20,260
You try to open your arms to cast a spell,

3388
03:23:20,260 --> 03:23:21,780
but your limbs are pinned.

3389
03:23:21,780 --> 03:23:25,110
The creature's already flaying strips of skin.

3390
03:23:25,110 --> 03:23:28,659
You convulse as your gut is ripped open.

3391
03:23:28,659 --> 03:23:31,659
Looking down, you see two fighting over your liver,

3392
03:23:31,659 --> 03:23:35,909
shoving each other away as they devour it.

3393
03:23:35,909 --> 03:23:37,149
Curse you!

3394
03:23:37,149 --> 03:23:40,250
Curse you, fucked up goblins!

3395
03:23:40,250 --> 03:23:41,489
You open your mouth to cry out,

3396
03:23:41,489 --> 03:23:43,969
but a beefy goblin kneels on your throat,

3397
03:23:43,969 --> 03:23:47,670
fingers clawing at the sweet taste of your eyes.

3398
03:23:47,670 --> 03:23:54,149
Long nails find their target and everything goes black.

3399
03:23:54,149 --> 03:23:57,209
You have been devoured by goblins.

3400
03:23:57,209 --> 03:23:58,799
You're dead.

3401
03:23:58,799 --> 03:24:03,530
You feel the cold veil of death surrounding you.

3402
03:24:03,530 --> 03:24:04,610
What's going on?

3403
03:24:04,610 --> 03:24:06,729
A moment later, you find yourself moving.

3404
03:24:06,729 --> 03:24:08,000
What's happening?

3405
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:18,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

3406
03:24:18,020 --> 03:24:18,860
What's happening?

3407
03:24:18,860 --> 03:24:20,770
Pee?

3408
03:24:20,770 --> 03:24:23,299
Where are my skin, my eyes, my flesh?

3409
03:24:23,299 --> 03:24:25,549
They were eating me?

3410
03:24:25,549 --> 03:24:27,719
What do I?

3411
03:24:27,719 --> 03:24:33,620
I can't cast anything.

3412
03:24:33,620 --> 03:24:51,739
I can cast zen.

3413
03:24:51,739 --> 03:24:57,049
You do not cast the spell, but rather it casts you,

3414
03:24:57,049 --> 03:25:08,750
pulling you open only to scatter you into the winds.

3415
03:25:08,750 --> 03:25:10,309
You're being wrenched in directions

3416
03:25:10,309 --> 03:25:12,370
you did not know existed.

3417
03:25:12,370 --> 03:25:13,850
The pain is unbearable,

3418
03:25:13,850 --> 03:25:15,450
and just when you think you will go mad from it,

3419
03:25:15,450 --> 03:25:17,930
the forces tear you apart.

3420
03:25:17,930 --> 03:25:21,809
Then you hit the ground in one piece,

3421
03:25:21,809 --> 03:25:25,100
in the thin alleyway leading from the great.

3422
03:25:25,100 --> 03:25:27,729
It is where you met the beggar,

3423
03:25:27,729 --> 03:25:32,020
but he is nowhere to be seen.

3424
03:25:32,020 --> 03:25:37,159
You've lost one point of maximum stamina.

3425
03:25:37,159 --> 03:25:39,020
Check myself over.

3426
03:25:39,020 --> 03:25:40,059
You pat yourself down.

3427
03:25:40,059 --> 03:25:42,620
You're quite alive.

3428
03:25:42,620 --> 03:25:44,979
What is more, you have all of your possessions,

3429
03:25:44,979 --> 03:25:46,579
all your gold, all your knowledge.

3430
03:25:46,579 --> 03:25:48,420
Everything is intact.

3431
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:51,600
The narrow alley mouth opens into the square.

3432
03:25:51,600 --> 03:25:55,639
You need to rest.

3433
03:25:55,639 --> 03:25:56,920
The alley isn't a bad place to rest.

3434
03:25:56,920 --> 03:26:00,520
It is quiet, secluded, and offers plenty of shadow.

3435
03:26:00,520 --> 03:26:02,799
Removing your pack, you try to settle under your habit,

3436
03:26:02,799 --> 03:26:06,170
despite the strange noises that drift through the air.

3437
03:26:06,170 --> 03:26:09,540
I'm alive.

3438
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:13,420
You close your eyes and let your tiredness overtake you.

3439
03:26:13,420 --> 03:26:15,950
What is left of the night is restless with visions.

3440
03:26:15,950 --> 03:26:18,030
Through it all, you feel the heat of Anorland

3441
03:26:18,030 --> 03:26:19,670
burning should your quest fail.

3442
03:26:23,940 --> 03:26:26,139
You lost a little maximum stamina,

3443
03:26:26,139 --> 03:26:29,020
died, and found no new clues.

3444
03:26:29,020 --> 03:26:31,420
The Archmage remains completely unaware of you.

3445
03:26:37,129 --> 03:26:38,250
You get quickly to your feet.

3446
03:26:38,250 --> 03:26:39,250
You have not been discovered,

3447
03:26:39,250 --> 03:26:42,500
but you should not wait any longer.

3448
03:26:42,500 --> 03:26:45,549
And now you are understanding

3449
03:26:45,549 --> 03:26:51,350
what the fourth episode is like.

3450
03:26:51,350 --> 03:26:54,809
Welcome to Zed.

3451
03:26:54,809 --> 03:26:59,600
There are no rewinds in the fourth episode.

3452
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:04,879
If you die, you cast Zed,

3453
03:27:04,879 --> 03:27:10,329
and you have to come back and do it all over again.

3454
03:27:10,329 --> 03:27:16,670
That's where we are now.

3455
03:27:16,670 --> 03:27:18,469
So as you see, I'm back here.

3456
03:27:18,469 --> 03:27:20,709
I'm about to go back into the square.

3457
03:27:20,709 --> 03:27:23,750
And I say that because you're noticing something over here.

3458
03:27:23,750 --> 03:27:27,139
Where are my pins?

3459
03:27:27,139 --> 03:27:37,010
They don't exist.

3460
03:27:37,010 --> 03:27:41,860
All the progress is physically gone,

3461
03:27:41,860 --> 03:27:45,180
but we have the knowledge of going there.

3462
03:27:45,180 --> 03:27:46,219
You keep all your items.

3463
03:27:46,219 --> 03:27:48,659
You keep all your gold, yes.

3464
03:27:48,659 --> 03:27:53,610
But the progress you made is reset.

3465
03:27:53,610 --> 03:27:55,409
So can you buy the sword now?

3466
03:27:55,409 --> 03:27:56,680
Yes.

3467
03:27:56,680 --> 03:28:00,889
That is the first thing we're gonna go do right now.

3468
03:28:00,889 --> 03:28:05,540
So imagine that this just reset to zero,

3469
03:28:05,540 --> 03:28:09,489
but I stayed the same.

3470
03:28:09,489 --> 03:28:11,049
So we don't technically have to do it again.

3471
03:28:11,049 --> 03:28:12,700
No.

3472
03:28:12,700 --> 03:28:15,399
I mean, I think there's a lot of stuff to get.

3473
03:28:15,399 --> 03:28:20,520
So you can be Zedded dozens of times,

3474
03:28:20,520 --> 03:28:21,840
I think, if you really wanted to.

3475
03:28:21,840 --> 03:28:23,520
Although you're gonna lose stamina every time.

3476
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:30,659
So it's not the greatest thing, not the greatest idea.

3477
03:28:30,659 --> 03:28:36,659
But yeah, let's go get that weapon.

3478
03:28:36,659 --> 03:28:40,579
Would you dupe swords?

3479
03:28:40,579 --> 03:28:45,299
I feel like there's no amount of money that you,

3480
03:28:45,299 --> 03:28:46,700
because it's 600 gold.

3481
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:49,819
I think that that's why it's 600 gold.

3482
03:28:49,819 --> 03:28:53,540
Because if you played through this game

3483
03:28:53,540 --> 03:28:56,879
and technically saved every single cent,

3484
03:28:56,879 --> 03:29:03,670
you might get close to 500, 600.

3485
03:29:03,670 --> 03:29:05,350
I guess maybe you could get two,

3486
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:10,020
but why would you ever get two?

3487
03:29:10,020 --> 03:29:12,280
If you gambled enough, yeah.

3488
03:29:12,280 --> 03:29:14,850
Jewels.

3489
03:29:14,850 --> 03:29:16,409
Can you check out that line again?

3490
03:29:16,409 --> 03:29:17,250
Oh, that's right.

3491
03:29:17,250 --> 03:29:18,840
Yes, I can.

3492
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:22,430
All right, now we're gonna go over there with knowledge.

3493
03:29:22,989 --> 03:29:23,829
We didn't do anything with the statue,

3494
03:29:23,829 --> 03:29:25,670
but I'm not gonna do that right now.

3495
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:28,790
Let's go clean up this stuff over here,

3496
03:29:28,790 --> 03:29:35,219
because I do want the weapon.

3497
03:29:35,219 --> 03:29:36,299
Everything is exactly the same.

3498
03:29:36,299 --> 03:29:38,479
So if you notice that I'm kind of speed running

3499
03:29:38,479 --> 03:29:39,319
through some of the dialogue,

3500
03:29:39,319 --> 03:29:42,319
it's because it is identical.

3501
03:29:42,319 --> 03:29:46,370
All right, let's do it.

3502
03:29:46,370 --> 03:29:49,430
Uh-huh, there's showing his wares.

3503
03:29:49,430 --> 03:29:53,059
We wanna go to the peddler.

3504
03:29:53,059 --> 03:29:54,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, we don't.

3505
03:29:54,260 --> 03:29:56,229
No, we don't.

3506
03:29:56,229 --> 03:29:58,370
There's nothing else here I wanted, right?

3507
03:29:58,370 --> 03:30:00,180
Hmm.

3508
03:30:00,180 --> 03:30:05,729
I don't think so.

3509
03:30:05,729 --> 03:30:11,440
Although I guess it remembers if you did buy something,

3510
03:30:11,440 --> 03:30:12,719
because I can't buy the mask.

3511
03:30:12,760 --> 03:30:17,950
Not the mask, the mirror.

3512
03:30:17,950 --> 03:30:19,989
How much is it?

3513
03:30:19,989 --> 03:30:21,750
18 gold, no.

3514
03:30:21,750 --> 03:30:23,110
I'd rather, no.

3515
03:30:23,110 --> 03:30:28,459
That's not happening.

3516
03:30:28,459 --> 03:30:30,579
Oh, I think it's because technically we already own it,

3517
03:30:30,579 --> 03:30:33,059
so it wouldn't become an option.

3518
03:30:33,059 --> 03:30:36,450
Yeah, okay.

3519
03:30:36,450 --> 03:30:40,840
I just didn't know if you could buy stuff twice.

3520
03:30:40,840 --> 03:30:42,120
All right, here we go.

3521
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:45,170
Do you buy gemstones?

3522
03:30:45,170 --> 03:30:46,530
I was told you might.

3523
03:30:46,530 --> 03:30:48,370
I might, may I see?

3524
03:30:48,370 --> 03:30:49,899
Take a look.

3525
03:30:49,899 --> 03:30:50,739
No.

3526
03:30:50,739 --> 03:30:52,549
Gems for a sword?

3527
03:30:52,549 --> 03:30:54,469
How about this?

3528
03:30:54,469 --> 03:30:57,420
My finest blade.

3529
03:30:57,420 --> 03:30:59,659
Okay, I'm making the trade.

3530
03:30:59,659 --> 03:31:01,139
You take the blade and hand over the gems.

3531
03:31:02,020 --> 03:31:03,860
The sword is truly magnificent.

3532
03:31:03,860 --> 03:31:06,260
You have never held anything like this.

3533
03:31:06,260 --> 03:31:09,549
The merchant nods with evident pleasure.

3534
03:31:09,549 --> 03:31:11,629
Cool.

3535
03:31:11,629 --> 03:31:14,899
What else do you have?

3536
03:31:14,899 --> 03:31:18,459
I don't want a broadsword.

3537
03:31:18,459 --> 03:31:19,420
You are not from Manpang?

3538
03:31:19,420 --> 03:31:23,329
Did we already ask this?

3539
03:31:23,329 --> 03:31:24,170
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3540
03:31:24,170 --> 03:31:25,010
We already saw this.

3541
03:31:25,010 --> 03:31:25,850
Okay, farewell.

3542
03:31:25,850 --> 03:31:31,440
Thank you.

3543
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:34,139
Wow.

3544
03:31:34,139 --> 03:31:37,020
I think it defaults to the best weapon.

3545
03:31:37,020 --> 03:31:40,829
I think it's a plus six.

3546
03:31:40,829 --> 03:31:45,229
I should not have any trouble fighting anymore.

3547
03:31:45,229 --> 03:31:47,510
All right, what else did I want to do over here

3548
03:31:47,510 --> 03:31:49,850
that I got wrong?

3549
03:31:49,850 --> 03:31:58,059
Maybe the, the captain?

3550
03:31:58,059 --> 03:32:03,940
By the glue?

3551
03:32:03,940 --> 03:32:04,780
Fortune teller.

3552
03:32:04,780 --> 03:32:09,270
Oh yeah, I want to go back to that line.

3553
03:32:09,270 --> 03:32:10,750
Fortune teller, okay.

3554
03:32:10,750 --> 03:32:17,649
So I'm put, what is the play here?

3555
03:32:17,649 --> 03:32:19,329
So you get to the long line.

3556
03:32:19,329 --> 03:32:22,190
Talk to the creature ahead of me.

3557
03:32:22,190 --> 03:32:23,909
Creature ahead of you is a hobgoblin.

3558
03:32:23,909 --> 03:32:27,329
Hey, like what's going on here?

3559
03:32:27,329 --> 03:32:28,930
Oh, you don't know?

3560
03:32:28,930 --> 03:32:30,409
Why are you waiting here if you don't know?

3561
03:32:30,409 --> 03:32:32,840
Oh, so I saw the line.

3562
03:32:32,840 --> 03:32:33,760
So you just joined.

3563
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:35,920
Well, I suppose when I first joined the line.

3564
03:32:35,920 --> 03:32:36,760
Okay, all right.

3565
03:32:37,659 --> 03:32:40,059
Uh, how long have you been waiting?

3566
03:32:40,059 --> 03:32:42,260
A few hours.

3567
03:32:42,260 --> 03:32:43,700
What do you mean this time?

3568
03:32:43,700 --> 03:32:44,700
This isn't my first visit.

3569
03:32:44,700 --> 03:32:48,020
I always, you can't go here just once.

3570
03:32:48,020 --> 03:32:48,860
Did you say wide?

3571
03:32:48,860 --> 03:32:49,700
Yeah, that's right.

3572
03:32:49,700 --> 03:32:51,100
Fair and wide.

3573
03:32:51,100 --> 03:32:52,530
Okay.

3574
03:32:52,530 --> 03:32:54,579
I would like to get back to waiting.

3575
03:32:54,579 --> 03:32:57,030
Okay, here we go.

3576
03:32:57,030 --> 03:32:58,950
You wait, a thin creature emerges from the building

3577
03:32:58,950 --> 03:33:01,790
with a curious half smile on his face.

3578
03:33:01,790 --> 03:33:06,639
Am I just going in right now?

3579
03:33:06,639 --> 03:33:12,459
I think I just go right in immediately.

3580
03:33:12,459 --> 03:33:15,340
You slip out of the line, which closes up behind you

3581
03:33:15,340 --> 03:33:17,659
and you walk towards the door of the building.

3582
03:33:17,659 --> 03:33:20,420
A wood golem stops you.

3583
03:33:20,420 --> 03:33:23,709
What do you think you're doing?

3584
03:33:23,709 --> 03:33:27,020
Get out of my way.

3585
03:33:27,020 --> 03:33:29,500
The wood golem shakes its head.

3586
03:33:29,500 --> 03:33:33,020
You wait your turn like everyone else.

3587
03:33:33,020 --> 03:33:38,530
Hmm, it's better that way.

3588
03:33:38,530 --> 03:33:40,010
Uh, are you a threat?

3589
03:33:40,010 --> 03:33:41,170
Is that a threat?

3590
03:33:41,170 --> 03:33:43,819
Is that a threat?

3591
03:33:43,819 --> 03:33:45,260
Oh no, not at all.

3592
03:33:45,260 --> 03:33:47,430
Not at all is advised.

3593
03:33:47,430 --> 03:33:50,510
If you visit a fortune teller early,

3594
03:33:50,510 --> 03:33:53,739
fortune they give is less precise.

3595
03:33:53,780 --> 03:33:56,139
That pays to wait as long as you can.

3596
03:34:00,110 --> 03:34:02,659
Push my way into the building.

3597
03:34:02,659 --> 03:34:03,979
You push the creature aside

3598
03:34:03,979 --> 03:34:06,020
and barge your way into the building.

3599
03:34:06,020 --> 03:34:12,350
To your surprise, those waiting in line give no response.

3600
03:34:12,350 --> 03:34:17,489
All right, I'm in.

3601
03:34:17,489 --> 03:34:18,770
You step inside the low building

3602
03:34:18,770 --> 03:34:21,069
just as the black elf leaves.

3603
03:34:21,069 --> 03:34:23,549
Inside the room appears to be empty.

3604
03:34:23,549 --> 03:34:25,950
Then a moment later, you notice a squat,

3605
03:34:25,950 --> 03:34:33,399
ugly figure behind the door clutching a pot.

3606
03:34:33,399 --> 03:34:35,340
Okay.

3607
03:34:35,340 --> 03:34:38,840
The creature meets your eyes and stares with fear.

3608
03:34:38,840 --> 03:34:45,139
It's clear he was about to try to strike you on the head.

3609
03:34:45,139 --> 03:34:46,819
Who are you?

3610
03:34:46,819 --> 03:34:47,659
Give me that thing.

3611
03:34:47,659 --> 03:34:52,059
You grab for the pot and toss it away into a corner.

3612
03:34:52,059 --> 03:34:54,500
Sorry about that.

3613
03:34:54,500 --> 03:34:56,459
I saw you coming, you see.

3614
03:34:56,459 --> 03:35:01,780
I knew you'd be trouble.

3615
03:35:01,780 --> 03:35:04,959
You are Farron Wyde?

3616
03:35:04,959 --> 03:35:07,840
Indeed I am.

3617
03:35:07,840 --> 03:35:11,440
The greatest fortune teller in Lower Mampang.

3618
03:35:11,440 --> 03:35:13,559
The only one, really.

3619
03:35:13,559 --> 03:35:20,750
The others were all, well, unpopular.

3620
03:35:20,750 --> 03:35:24,639
And you are very popular?

3621
03:35:24,639 --> 03:35:26,319
The line outside is long.

3622
03:35:26,319 --> 03:35:28,840
You're very popular.

3623
03:35:28,840 --> 03:35:32,489
Being loyal, I could tell my little ruse

3624
03:35:32,489 --> 03:35:34,290
wouldn't work with you.

3625
03:35:34,290 --> 03:35:36,329
So I didn't bother.

3626
03:35:36,329 --> 03:35:38,329
People who come looking for fortunes

3627
03:35:38,329 --> 03:35:41,299
never really want to hear them, you see.

3628
03:35:41,299 --> 03:35:45,280
They always want to be just about to hear them.

3629
03:35:45,280 --> 03:35:48,559
So that's what I do.

3630
03:35:48,559 --> 03:35:51,370
You are a con artist.

3631
03:35:51,409 --> 03:35:53,360
Oh, no.

3632
03:35:53,360 --> 03:35:55,879
I really can see their futures.

3633
03:35:55,879 --> 03:35:57,370
All of them.

3634
03:35:57,370 --> 03:35:58,930
But why tell them?

3635
03:35:58,930 --> 03:36:02,129
Who wants to know they're gonna die of stomach blight?

3636
03:36:02,129 --> 03:36:04,850
Or that their husband is gonna leave them

3637
03:36:04,850 --> 03:36:05,969
for a rock goblin.

3638
03:36:05,969 --> 03:36:10,459
What good does that do, again?

3639
03:36:10,459 --> 03:36:14,799
You are, you truly are a fortune teller.

3640
03:36:14,799 --> 03:36:18,659
Mm, mm, more is the pity.

3641
03:36:18,659 --> 03:36:21,149
Please leave.

3642
03:36:21,149 --> 03:36:24,860
What is my fortune, you demand?

3643
03:36:24,860 --> 03:36:26,219
Won't say.

3644
03:36:26,219 --> 03:36:28,739
Can't make me say.

3645
03:36:29,500 --> 03:36:32,190
Do it or I'll kill you.

3646
03:36:32,190 --> 03:36:36,170
You ball your fingers into a fist.

3647
03:36:36,170 --> 03:36:38,729
Told you you'd make trouble.

3648
03:36:38,729 --> 03:36:41,610
I'm never wrong, see?

3649
03:36:41,610 --> 03:36:42,969
So tell me my fortune.

3650
03:36:42,969 --> 03:36:46,989
You are an imposter, you tell him.

3651
03:36:46,989 --> 03:36:49,020
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

3652
03:36:49,020 --> 03:36:51,139
Will you answer the question?

3653
03:36:51,139 --> 03:36:52,780
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

3654
03:36:52,780 --> 03:36:53,620
Let me ask you.

3655
03:36:53,620 --> 03:36:57,219
Is it possible to pass the Throvan doors?

3656
03:36:57,219 --> 03:36:59,899
Why throws his hands over his ears?

3657
03:36:59,899 --> 03:37:01,979
Please don't ask me anything.

3658
03:37:01,979 --> 03:37:07,700
Everything you say makes it more and more obvious.

3659
03:37:07,700 --> 03:37:09,870
Makes what obvious?

3660
03:37:09,870 --> 03:37:12,260
Who you are.

3661
03:37:12,260 --> 03:37:15,350
Then shakes his head sharply from side to side.

3662
03:37:15,350 --> 03:37:17,750
Oh, it's no good, it's no good.

3663
03:37:17,750 --> 03:37:19,309
It's too late already.

3664
03:37:20,430 --> 03:37:21,629
Please go, please go.

3665
03:37:21,629 --> 03:37:22,950
I've got people waiting.

3666
03:37:22,950 --> 03:37:24,950
Oh, shoot.

3667
03:37:24,950 --> 03:37:27,549
Oh, butterfingers.

3668
03:37:27,549 --> 03:37:31,870
Oh, you are, oh boy.

3669
03:37:31,870 --> 03:37:34,590
You walk away from the unfortunate fortune teller

3670
03:37:34,590 --> 03:37:37,180
and leave the building once more.

3671
03:37:37,180 --> 03:37:49,860
Outside, the line shuffles forward as you emerge.

3672
03:37:49,860 --> 03:37:51,379
Oh, he's improvising now.

3673
03:37:51,379 --> 03:37:52,260
He's improvising.

3674
03:37:52,260 --> 03:37:54,659
Hey, what the fuck was that, dude?

3675
03:37:54,659 --> 03:37:58,709
What?

3676
03:37:58,709 --> 03:38:03,139
What was wrong with that?

3677
03:38:03,139 --> 03:38:06,409
Looking furious about something.

3678
03:38:06,409 --> 03:38:09,149
Yeah.

3679
03:38:09,149 --> 03:38:10,389
All right, well, that was fun.

3680
03:38:10,389 --> 03:38:11,270
I don't think I did it right,

3681
03:38:11,270 --> 03:38:20,049
but it was still humorous and fun to do.

3682
03:38:20,049 --> 03:38:22,569
I, did I miss something?

3683
03:38:22,569 --> 03:38:24,409
What about the hawker?

3684
03:38:24,409 --> 03:38:30,370
Something else I could do here?

3685
03:38:30,370 --> 03:38:32,379
Oh, this is okay.

3686
03:38:32,379 --> 03:38:39,600
Can I get anything else from the stone?

3687
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:49,659
Is there another question I could have asked?

3688
03:38:49,659 --> 03:38:50,780
You think you're going to finish this today?

3689
03:38:50,780 --> 03:38:53,540
Oh, no way.

3690
03:38:53,540 --> 03:38:55,649
No way.

3691
03:38:55,649 --> 03:38:58,940
There's probably at least one or two more streams of this

3692
03:38:58,940 --> 03:39:01,129
because I'm probably going to end soon.

3693
03:39:01,129 --> 03:39:06,379
Probably like four hours.

3694
03:39:06,379 --> 03:39:09,780
So if there's another three to five hour sorcery stream,

3695
03:39:09,780 --> 03:39:11,620
we might get there.

3696
03:39:11,620 --> 03:39:13,219
We might need one more to clean it up

3697
03:39:13,219 --> 03:39:20,069
and move on to something else.

3698
03:39:20,069 --> 03:39:21,469
No, not four more hours.

3699
03:39:21,469 --> 03:39:22,629
I mean, at hour number four.

3700
03:39:22,629 --> 03:39:27,899
So in like 20, 30 minutes.

3701
03:39:27,899 --> 03:39:28,860
Four is not soon.

3702
03:39:28,860 --> 03:39:35,190
Well, I mean like four hours streamed.

3703
03:39:35,190 --> 03:39:36,389
There are no takebacks.

3704
03:39:40,219 --> 03:39:41,739
You could beat the game in 10 minutes right now

3705
03:39:41,739 --> 03:39:43,149
if you know.

3706
03:39:43,149 --> 03:39:46,309
Yeah, I, okay.

3707
03:39:46,309 --> 03:39:50,620
I could technically beat the game right now,

3708
03:39:50,620 --> 03:39:54,549
but I want to experience it.

3709
03:39:54,549 --> 03:39:55,389
I want to experience it.

3710
03:39:55,389 --> 03:40:01,870
I don't want to just run to the end.

3711
03:40:01,870 --> 03:40:03,750
There's a lot of fun stuff to still see.

3712
03:40:03,750 --> 03:40:05,750
So I want to see it.

3713
03:40:05,750 --> 03:40:08,299
It's been too long.

3714
03:40:08,299 --> 03:40:12,979
I can't imagine I'm going to play this again anytime soon.

3715
03:40:12,979 --> 03:40:16,120
It's been six or seven years at this point.

3716
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:20,520
So you have to imagine it'll be at least a few years

3717
03:40:20,520 --> 03:40:21,559
before I would do it again.

3718
03:40:21,559 --> 03:40:23,159
So I'm good.

3719
03:40:23,159 --> 03:40:27,459
I'm good to slowly and surely kind of

3720
03:40:27,459 --> 03:40:31,459
take it little by little.

3721
03:40:31,459 --> 03:40:33,930
All right, so let's keep going.

3722
03:40:33,930 --> 03:40:39,979
I don't think there's anything else I can do here,

3723
03:40:39,979 --> 03:40:42,459
but I'm going to go.

3724
03:40:42,459 --> 03:40:45,319
I want to go into here.

3725
03:40:45,319 --> 03:40:46,639
And I forget what's in here.

3726
03:40:46,639 --> 03:40:50,260
I want to go in there.

3727
03:40:50,260 --> 03:40:54,340
Wait a minute.

3728
03:40:55,760 --> 03:40:57,120
This is bad.

3729
03:40:57,120 --> 03:41:00,479
You head away from the maze of stalls and shops.

3730
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:02,760
There is a sudden commotion amongst the crowd.

3731
03:41:02,760 --> 03:41:05,000
People are shouting and pointing, looking up.

3732
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:08,329
The skies have been darkened by widespread wings.

3733
03:41:08,329 --> 03:41:10,489
Birdmen.

3734
03:41:10,489 --> 03:41:12,559
Let's watch.

3735
03:41:12,559 --> 03:41:14,559
You watch motionless.

3736
03:41:14,559 --> 03:41:17,120
Perhaps they have not yet seen you.

3737
03:41:17,120 --> 03:41:19,000
The people of Mampang are terrified

3738
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,600
and scatter in all directions around you.

3739
03:41:21,600 --> 03:41:23,559
The birdmen swoop down onto the ground

3740
03:41:23,559 --> 03:41:25,930
and they'll now empty market.

3741
03:41:25,930 --> 03:41:29,979
They then begin to pound across the flagstones,

3742
03:41:29,979 --> 03:41:31,719
but not towards you.

3743
03:41:31,719 --> 03:41:34,559
Instead, they enter the hut of the fortune teller,

3744
03:41:34,559 --> 03:41:36,860
Farrenwide.

3745
03:41:36,860 --> 03:41:39,059
A moment later, everything is still.

3746
03:41:39,059 --> 03:41:42,350
Oh no, they're going to question him.

3747
03:41:42,350 --> 03:41:45,229
Keep watching?

3748
03:41:45,229 --> 03:41:46,549
What are they doing?

3749
03:41:46,549 --> 03:41:48,950
Are they arresting him for talking to you?

3750
03:41:48,950 --> 03:41:52,250
And will he sell you out?

3751
03:41:52,250 --> 03:41:55,860
He's not going to sell me out.

3752
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:58,020
You stay low watching.

3753
03:41:58,020 --> 03:41:59,879
Nothing happens.

3754
03:41:59,879 --> 03:42:02,360
And then the thatched roof of the low building

3755
03:42:02,360 --> 03:42:06,840
explodes outwards and the birdmen rise from inside.

3756
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:11,059
Farrenwide dangles from their talons, limp.

3757
03:42:11,059 --> 03:42:12,420
The birdmen wheel about

3758
03:42:12,420 --> 03:42:15,299
and disappear towards the inner tower.

3759
03:42:15,299 --> 03:42:19,379
Oh shit, I killed that guy.

3760
03:42:19,379 --> 03:42:25,459
Do you think he talked?

3761
03:42:25,459 --> 03:42:27,799
He's not going to talk.

3762
03:42:27,799 --> 03:42:29,389
No.

3763
03:42:29,389 --> 03:42:30,709
I mean, I did threaten him.

3764
03:42:30,709 --> 03:42:32,950
I did say, tell my fortune or I'll kill you.

3765
03:42:34,229 --> 03:42:35,590
He probably doesn't think we're the nicest person,

3766
03:42:35,590 --> 03:42:39,840
but he must know our quest is important.

3767
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:40,680
Why wouldn't he talk?

3768
03:42:40,680 --> 03:42:42,700
Because I'm the Anor Lander.

3769
03:42:42,700 --> 03:42:50,700
I'm supposed to save every, I'm here to save everybody.

3770
03:42:50,700 --> 03:42:53,700
You are, I'm, he's not going to talk.

3771
03:42:54,180 --> 03:42:57,280
It's fine.

3772
03:42:57,280 --> 03:43:00,860
Rest in peace, goofy voice man.

3773
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:02,979
I'm not going to be able to hear that character again.

3774
03:43:02,979 --> 03:43:04,729
That's sad, that's right.

3775
03:43:04,729 --> 03:43:06,700
All right, I want to look in here.

3776
03:43:06,700 --> 03:43:07,620
You stroll through the arch

3777
03:43:07,620 --> 03:43:10,739
into a well-appointed empty courtyard.

3778
03:43:10,739 --> 03:43:12,459
From a small booth by the entrance way,

3779
03:43:12,459 --> 03:43:14,020
a guard nods to you.

3780
03:43:14,020 --> 03:43:16,180
Brother?

3781
03:43:16,180 --> 03:43:24,659
Oh, I've been in this, I'm still in this disguise.

3782
03:43:24,659 --> 03:43:26,139
You step out into the central courtyard

3783
03:43:26,139 --> 03:43:28,239
that fills this enclosure.

3784
03:43:28,239 --> 03:43:31,100
This place is blessedly quiet.

3785
03:43:31,100 --> 03:43:33,190
With several routes leading out of it,

3786
03:43:33,190 --> 03:43:35,420
a dome looks up at the sky.

3787
03:43:35,420 --> 03:43:39,139
A fountain plays in the center of the courtyard.

3788
03:43:39,139 --> 03:43:41,180
Search the courtyard.

3789
03:43:41,180 --> 03:43:42,180
You look around the courtyard,

3790
03:43:42,180 --> 03:43:44,059
but there isn't much to see beyond the fountain

3791
03:43:44,059 --> 03:43:46,020
and the benches that surround it.

3792
03:43:46,020 --> 03:43:49,100
The doors are a mixture of shops and storage rooms.

3793
03:43:49,100 --> 03:43:52,139
A few brightly feathered birds flap past overhead.

3794
03:43:52,139 --> 03:43:57,889
This little square is almost comfortable.

3795
03:43:57,889 --> 03:43:59,670
Look at the fountain.

3796
03:43:59,670 --> 03:44:01,190
The water from the fountain plays merrily

3797
03:44:01,190 --> 03:44:04,750
over several stone statues set into the center of the bowl,

3798
03:44:04,750 --> 03:44:08,180
arching satyrs, weeping maidens,

3799
03:44:08,180 --> 03:44:11,409
aged men, head-butting orcs.

3800
03:44:11,409 --> 03:44:13,020
It must tell some legend,

3801
03:44:13,059 --> 03:44:15,819
but what that legend might be has clearly been lost to time

3802
03:44:15,819 --> 03:44:18,700
and the wearing water.

3803
03:44:18,700 --> 03:44:21,180
Let's drink.

3804
03:44:21,180 --> 03:44:22,819
You cup a handful of the sparkling water

3805
03:44:22,819 --> 03:44:24,280
and raise it to your lips.

3806
03:44:24,280 --> 03:44:25,920
A moment later, you spit it out.

3807
03:44:25,920 --> 03:44:29,340
Gasping for breath, the water is quite foul.

3808
03:44:29,340 --> 03:44:31,420
A door leads out to the main square of the inner city,

3809
03:44:31,420 --> 03:44:32,700
but there are several other doors

3810
03:44:32,700 --> 03:44:34,219
leading off from the courtyard.

3811
03:44:34,219 --> 03:44:38,709
One is a signpost, Nighlok.

3812
03:44:38,709 --> 03:44:47,659
Did we hear about Nighlok?

3813
03:44:47,659 --> 03:44:50,600
Uh, I feel like I could die in any one of these.

3814
03:44:50,600 --> 03:44:58,389
So let's just go in here.

3815
03:44:58,389 --> 03:45:00,270
You slip into a small side room.

3816
03:45:00,270 --> 03:45:01,430
Inside are a pile of crates

3817
03:45:01,430 --> 03:45:05,469
and a side room that are marked with the Seal of Kare.

3818
03:45:05,469 --> 03:45:07,059
Let's take a look.

3819
03:45:07,059 --> 03:45:09,459
There are several stacked crates,

3820
03:45:09,459 --> 03:45:12,530
each bearing the official mark of Kare's First Noble.

3821
03:45:12,530 --> 03:45:14,309
What are they doing here?

3822
03:45:14,309 --> 03:45:16,190
A few large empty crates lie undisturbed

3823
03:45:16,190 --> 03:45:19,670
at the back of the room.

3824
03:45:19,670 --> 03:45:22,879
Open an empty crate.

3825
03:45:22,879 --> 03:45:25,319
Isn't that kind of a,

3826
03:45:25,319 --> 03:45:31,680
doesn't that imply there's nothing in there?

3827
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:35,010
You open one of the large crates, empty and roomy.

3828
03:45:35,010 --> 03:45:36,690
It occurs to you that you could hide

3829
03:45:36,690 --> 03:45:40,979
your monk's concealing habit in one of the boxes for later.

3830
03:45:40,979 --> 03:45:55,370
Oh, stash my disguise?

3831
03:45:55,370 --> 03:45:58,579
Open a sealed crate.

3832
03:45:58,579 --> 03:45:59,620
The crates are nailed shut,

3833
03:45:59,620 --> 03:46:02,299
but you manage to slip your cutlass between two boards.

3834
03:46:02,299 --> 03:46:04,620
You pry off the lid.

3835
03:46:04,620 --> 03:46:07,260
Inside are stacks of magical armor,

3836
03:46:07,260 --> 03:46:10,799
the kind you saw used in Kare by Vik's army of werewolves.

3837
03:46:10,799 --> 03:46:12,399
How could they possibly be here?

3838
03:46:12,399 --> 03:46:17,850
And if it's here, is Vik here too?

3839
03:46:17,850 --> 03:46:20,649
You saw several sets of lupine armor up close

3840
03:46:20,649 --> 03:46:22,409
during your time in Kare.

3841
03:46:22,409 --> 03:46:30,360
This looks similar, though perhaps not as well-made.

3842
03:46:30,360 --> 03:46:31,200
That's it.

3843
03:46:31,200 --> 03:46:39,440
So I can hide my disguise in here, that's fine.

3844
03:46:39,440 --> 03:46:41,780
All right, which way now?

3845
03:46:41,780 --> 03:46:46,389
Uh, let's just check them all, as long as I don't die.

3846
03:46:46,389 --> 03:46:47,549
You approach the guard's room.

3847
03:46:47,549 --> 03:46:51,899
The guard turns to you with narrowed, unfriendly eyes.

3848
03:46:51,899 --> 03:46:54,829
What?

3849
03:46:54,829 --> 03:46:57,819
There's a thief in the courtyard.

3850
03:46:57,819 --> 03:47:00,829
Yeah, there is.

3851
03:47:00,829 --> 03:47:02,870
Her name is Nylock.

3852
03:47:02,870 --> 03:47:03,950
With that, she waves you away.

3853
03:47:03,950 --> 03:47:14,399
You head back to the courtyard.

3854
03:47:14,399 --> 03:47:20,290
Uh, side chambers?

3855
03:47:20,290 --> 03:47:21,979
Interesting.

3856
03:47:21,979 --> 03:47:23,379
You choose a small side door,

3857
03:47:23,379 --> 03:47:26,139
which opens to reveal dirty living quarters.

3858
03:47:26,139 --> 03:47:29,020
A bare rug covers the floor,

3859
03:47:29,020 --> 03:47:32,010
and an unmade bed lists in the corner.

3860
03:47:32,010 --> 03:47:36,219
A wood chest sits at its foot, facing an empty table.

3861
03:47:36,219 --> 03:47:42,219
A chest.

3862
03:47:42,219 --> 03:47:46,860
This is presumably home to some lowly guard or other.

3863
03:47:46,860 --> 03:47:48,780
Pull up the rug.

3864
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:51,500
You grab the edge of the rug, cutlass at the ready.

3865
03:47:51,500 --> 03:47:53,659
Flip it over.

3866
03:47:53,659 --> 03:47:55,459
You flip it aside to find a small trapdoor

3867
03:47:55,459 --> 03:47:58,079
set into the floor of the room.

3868
03:47:58,079 --> 03:48:01,459
Open it.

3869
03:48:01,459 --> 03:48:03,780
You grasp the handle and pull with all your might,

3870
03:48:03,780 --> 03:48:05,049
but it doesn't budge.

3871
03:48:05,049 --> 03:48:07,940
The door doesn't even rattle.

3872
03:48:07,940 --> 03:48:10,190
Let's look closely.

3873
03:48:10,190 --> 03:48:13,700
You feel along, you feel along the edges,

3874
03:48:13,700 --> 03:48:16,100
discovering that it's a fake.

3875
03:48:16,100 --> 03:48:17,860
The wood has merely been cleverly cut

3876
03:48:17,860 --> 03:48:19,799
to appear like a trapdoor.

3877
03:48:19,799 --> 03:48:21,399
You let the rug fall once more.

3878
03:48:21,399 --> 03:48:24,139
Why?

3879
03:48:24,139 --> 03:48:27,700
Open the chest.

3880
03:48:27,700 --> 03:48:28,860
You squat down in front of the chest.

3881
03:48:28,860 --> 03:48:31,020
There is no lock.

3882
03:48:31,540 --> 03:48:33,459
Open it.

3883
03:48:33,459 --> 03:48:36,010
You flip open the lid.

3884
03:48:36,010 --> 03:48:38,579
Step back.

3885
03:48:38,579 --> 03:48:41,370
Poison gas is coming out.

3886
03:48:41,370 --> 03:48:44,659
You step quickly back, but nothing else happens.

3887
03:48:44,659 --> 03:48:46,700
The box appears quite empty.

3888
03:48:46,700 --> 03:48:48,399
Nothing jumps out of it.

3889
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:51,729
There isn't even a cobweb or a loose gold coin.

3890
03:48:51,729 --> 03:48:55,209
Maybe this is a simple servant's room.

3891
03:48:55,209 --> 03:48:56,969
Tip the box over.

3892
03:48:56,969 --> 03:49:00,260
You lift the box out from under the table and turn it over.

3893
03:49:00,260 --> 03:49:06,569
Then you hear a click from somewhere behind you.

3894
03:49:06,569 --> 03:49:09,370
You turn and rush towards the exit, but you're too late.

3895
03:49:09,370 --> 03:49:12,170
A heavy portcullis is dropped from the ceiling,

3896
03:49:12,170 --> 03:49:13,090
barring the doorway.

3897
03:49:13,090 --> 03:49:14,979
You are trapped.

3898
03:49:14,979 --> 03:49:18,350
From somewhere nearby, you hear a hissing noise.

3899
03:49:18,350 --> 03:49:20,280
Oh God.

3900
03:49:20,280 --> 03:49:21,760
You hold your breath to listen.

3901
03:49:21,760 --> 03:49:23,200
The hissing is growing louder.

3902
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:25,819
Look up.

3903
03:49:25,819 --> 03:49:27,739
You look up to see a greenish cloud

3904
03:49:27,739 --> 03:49:28,979
descend from the ceiling.

3905
03:49:28,979 --> 03:49:31,239
Poison gas.

3906
03:49:31,239 --> 03:49:33,520
This is not anyone's living quarters.

3907
03:49:33,520 --> 03:49:35,559
This room is nothing but a trap

3908
03:49:35,559 --> 03:49:37,280
and you have walked straight into it.

3909
03:49:37,280 --> 03:49:40,090
God damn it.

3910
03:49:40,090 --> 03:49:50,100
Can I do anything here?

3911
03:49:50,100 --> 03:49:51,329
I'm throwing a grenade.

3912
03:49:51,329 --> 03:49:52,170
I can't.

3913
03:49:52,170 --> 03:49:56,680
I used it to test the water lake an hour ago.

3914
03:49:56,680 --> 03:49:58,889
What an idiot.

3915
03:49:58,889 --> 03:50:07,569
Strength?

3916
03:50:07,569 --> 03:50:09,219
A huff might work.

3917
03:50:09,219 --> 03:50:14,780
Gale horn?

3918
03:50:14,780 --> 03:50:16,940
You turn into the starlight

3919
03:50:16,940 --> 03:50:18,219
and put the alignment around you,

3920
03:50:18,219 --> 03:50:20,659
lifting the gale horn and blowing a loud note.

3921
03:50:20,659 --> 03:50:23,059
The mighty gale howls about the room,

3922
03:50:23,059 --> 03:50:25,819
blowing the poison gas out through the portcullis.

3923
03:50:25,819 --> 03:50:28,690
The clean air tastes sweet.

3924
03:50:28,690 --> 03:50:31,750
You approach the portcullis.

3925
03:50:31,750 --> 03:50:32,590
Help!

3926
03:50:32,590 --> 03:50:33,430
Help!

3927
03:50:33,430 --> 03:50:34,270
Help!

3928
03:50:34,270 --> 03:50:35,110
Help!

3929
03:50:35,110 --> 03:50:36,319
Help!

3930
03:50:36,319 --> 03:50:38,680
It's not gonna work.

3931
03:50:38,680 --> 03:50:41,360
Let's look it over.

3932
03:50:41,360 --> 03:50:42,200
Looking over the grate,

3933
03:50:42,200 --> 03:50:45,010
you can see it descends from a hidden panel in the ceiling,

3934
03:50:45,010 --> 03:50:46,809
but you can't see any switches or levers

3935
03:50:46,809 --> 03:50:51,260
on the walls either side.

3936
03:50:54,159 --> 03:50:55,770
I'm gonna lift it.

3937
03:50:55,770 --> 03:50:56,850
In your healthy condition,

3938
03:50:56,850 --> 03:50:58,729
you have no trouble lifting the gate.

3939
03:50:58,729 --> 03:51:03,500
It rolls up and you hold it aloft before diving under it.

3940
03:51:03,500 --> 03:51:08,120
Okay, so it was just a trap room.

3941
03:51:08,120 --> 03:51:10,409
All right, now we're gonna go in here.

3942
03:51:10,409 --> 03:51:17,760
Let's wait.

3943
03:51:17,760 --> 03:51:20,120
Wait a minute.

3944
03:51:20,120 --> 03:51:22,780
Can I come out of this?

3945
03:51:22,780 --> 03:51:26,290
Wait.

3946
03:51:26,290 --> 03:51:27,129
No.

3947
03:51:27,129 --> 03:51:30,110
There's a different one.

3948
03:51:30,110 --> 03:51:34,889
All right, let's go to Nylok's shop.

3949
03:51:34,889 --> 03:51:37,500
I did come out from under that.

3950
03:51:37,500 --> 03:51:39,620
You enter a trade post of some kind.

3951
03:51:39,620 --> 03:51:43,290
A bald woman with one eye leans on a counter,

3952
03:51:43,290 --> 03:51:46,569
flanked by shelves stacked with goods and trinkets.

3953
03:51:46,569 --> 03:51:53,319
At this moment, she's talking to a finely dressed traveler.

3954
03:52:02,899 --> 03:52:05,579
The merchant Nylok glances up as you enter,

3955
03:52:05,579 --> 03:52:08,819
then returns to her bargaining.

3956
03:52:08,819 --> 03:52:12,040
Still, I'm, okay, well, I'm gonna take shit.

3957
03:52:12,040 --> 03:52:19,780
You stroll over to the back of the room.

3958
03:52:19,780 --> 03:52:23,379
The man and Nylok are both distracted by their bargaining.

3959
03:52:23,379 --> 03:52:25,340
You pretend to examine a stack of pelts

3960
03:52:25,340 --> 03:52:27,500
while spying some likely trinkets

3961
03:52:27,500 --> 03:52:29,799
in the corner of your eye.

3962
03:52:29,799 --> 03:52:31,559
Grab something and run.

3963
03:52:31,559 --> 03:52:37,280
Quietly pocket something or don't risk it.

3964
03:52:37,280 --> 03:52:38,319
I've never picked it

3965
03:52:38,319 --> 03:52:43,799
because it always feels like the just die option,

3966
03:52:43,799 --> 03:52:46,680
but it's funny that you can actually just grab and run.

3967
03:52:46,680 --> 03:52:49,530
Somebody's just gonna kill you.

3968
03:52:49,530 --> 03:52:51,489
Maybe it works.

3969
03:52:51,489 --> 03:52:57,959
Maybe it works.

3970
03:52:57,959 --> 03:53:00,479
This option is always here.

3971
03:53:00,479 --> 03:53:02,989
I never touch it.

3972
03:53:02,989 --> 03:53:05,329
I feel like, should we just try?

3973
03:53:05,329 --> 03:53:15,000
Like, if I grab and just fucking run, it might just work.

3974
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:18,000
Moving quickly, you grab a jewel of gold

3975
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:19,860
off the nearest shelf.

3976
03:53:19,860 --> 03:53:22,979
Clutching your prize, you race for the door.

3977
03:53:22,979 --> 03:53:25,700
Nylok languidly presses a switch as you reach the door

3978
03:53:25,700 --> 03:53:27,620
and a thick rope net drops from the ceiling.

3979
03:53:27,620 --> 03:53:31,239
You are trapped.

3980
03:53:31,239 --> 03:53:35,250
Nice try, but this is Mampang.

3981
03:53:35,250 --> 03:53:39,520
You have to be faster than that to steal from me.

3982
03:53:39,520 --> 03:53:40,360
I'm sorry.

3983
03:53:40,360 --> 03:53:41,200
I said, release me.

3984
03:53:41,200 --> 03:53:42,040
I, release me.

3985
03:53:42,040 --> 03:53:43,520
I, you cannot keep me here.

3986
03:53:43,520 --> 03:53:45,450
I'm so sorry.

3987
03:53:45,450 --> 03:53:47,440
I don't intend to.

3988
03:53:47,440 --> 03:53:52,239
She pulls on a bell rope and a group of guards soon arrive.

3989
03:53:52,239 --> 03:53:57,920
Oh, that didn't work.

3990
03:53:57,920 --> 03:54:00,680
Bound and gagged, you are dragged by your ankles

3991
03:54:00,680 --> 03:54:04,159
by two guards who mutter about the trouble caused.

3992
03:54:04,159 --> 03:54:07,840
They gossip to passing companions about you.

3993
03:54:07,879 --> 03:54:10,819
The tale of your exploits will soon spread through Mampang.

3994
03:54:10,819 --> 03:54:20,420
This will make it more...

3995
03:54:20,420 --> 03:54:23,020
Don't say room temperature IQ.

3996
03:54:23,020 --> 03:54:25,590
I was testing that.

3997
03:54:25,590 --> 03:54:26,590
I don't know.

3998
03:54:26,590 --> 03:54:28,860
Yeah, I'm trying to...

3999
03:54:28,860 --> 03:54:31,120
What's the worst thing you could possibly do

4000
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:33,629
when you're trying to lay low?

4001
03:54:33,629 --> 03:54:39,010
Is scream while you're stealing from a store.

4002
03:54:39,010 --> 03:54:41,610
Like, I'm gonna just grab this and run out

4003
03:54:41,610 --> 03:54:43,569
and bump into a bunch of shit on the way out.

4004
03:54:43,569 --> 03:54:45,770
That's the worst thing I could have possibly done.

4005
03:54:45,770 --> 03:54:46,889
Somebody said, hey, rewind.

4006
03:54:46,889 --> 03:54:47,729
I can't.

4007
03:54:47,729 --> 03:54:48,569
It's over.

4008
03:54:48,569 --> 03:54:49,729
There's no rewinding now.

4009
03:54:50,489 --> 03:54:51,729
And that's not a rule I put on myself.

4010
03:54:51,729 --> 03:54:54,079
That is baked into the game now.

4011
03:54:54,079 --> 03:54:56,979
It's over.

4012
03:54:56,979 --> 03:54:59,180
The tale of your exploits will soon spread through Mampang.

4013
03:54:59,180 --> 03:55:01,420
This will make it more difficult to blend in from now on

4014
03:55:01,420 --> 03:55:03,989
should you escape.

4015
03:55:03,989 --> 03:55:06,629
Try to bribe them.

4016
03:55:06,629 --> 03:55:08,270
You attempt to bribe them,

4017
03:55:08,270 --> 03:55:11,040
offering rewards and fabulous riches.

4018
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:12,040
But through the gag,

4019
03:55:12,040 --> 03:55:15,680
it is little more than the mummery of an idiot.

4020
03:55:15,680 --> 03:55:17,280
The guards ignore you.

4021
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:19,040
I'll give you jewels.

4022
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:21,079
I'll give you precious stones.

4023
03:55:22,040 --> 03:55:25,360
Mm, mm, mm!

4024
03:55:25,360 --> 03:55:27,239
Hopelessly, you are dragged into the office

4025
03:55:27,239 --> 03:55:34,450
of the commander of the guard.

4026
03:55:34,450 --> 03:55:35,489
The room is windowless,

4027
03:55:35,489 --> 03:55:42,670
but lit by a half dozen lamps scattered about.

4028
03:55:42,670 --> 03:55:44,940
I love this picture.

4029
03:55:44,940 --> 03:55:45,780
Is it a picture?

4030
03:55:45,780 --> 03:55:47,559
Or is that somebody outside looking in?

4031
03:55:47,559 --> 03:55:48,680
Wait, I don't know.

4032
03:55:48,680 --> 03:55:52,209
No, there's no windows.

4033
03:55:52,209 --> 03:55:54,850
Khartoum, commander of the guards of Mampang,

4034
03:55:54,850 --> 03:56:01,879
sits behind a wooden desk covered in scattered parchments.

4035
03:56:01,879 --> 03:56:02,879
Hello?

4036
03:56:02,879 --> 03:56:06,879
Uh, I, ow!

4037
03:56:06,879 --> 03:56:08,799
Who is this?

4038
03:56:08,799 --> 03:56:10,440
Khartoum demands.

4039
03:56:10,479 --> 03:56:11,719
His high-pitched voice

4040
03:56:11,719 --> 03:56:15,920
is an odd contrast to his grim face.

4041
03:56:15,920 --> 03:56:19,799
That's, this is, it's, I, zip!

4042
03:56:19,799 --> 03:56:21,590
Who is this?

4043
03:56:21,590 --> 03:56:22,829
Khartoum demands.

4044
03:56:22,829 --> 03:56:26,799
His high-pitched voice is an odd contrast to his grim face.

4045
03:56:26,799 --> 03:56:27,799
Wait!

4046
03:56:27,799 --> 03:56:31,489
He snaps before one of the guards can speak.

4047
03:56:31,489 --> 03:56:35,479
This is almost certainly the Anilander.

4048
03:56:35,479 --> 03:56:37,379
Yeah, it's true.

4049
03:56:37,379 --> 03:56:38,340
It's true.

4050
03:56:38,340 --> 03:56:39,959
What can I say?

4051
03:56:39,959 --> 03:56:42,920
The captain has taken aback.

4052
03:56:42,920 --> 03:56:45,700
I did not expect you to admit it.

4053
03:56:45,700 --> 03:56:50,000
The tales of your cunning are obviously exaggerated.

4054
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:50,840
Are they?

4055
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:55,670
He sighs.

4056
03:56:55,670 --> 03:56:58,479
It would appear so, yes.

4057
03:56:58,479 --> 03:57:03,319
I should have you killed as fast as possible.

4058
03:57:03,319 --> 03:57:04,959
Why don't you try it then?

4059
03:57:04,959 --> 03:57:07,879
What are you gonna do?

4060
03:57:07,879 --> 03:57:13,299
He stares back at you and you see fear creeping at his eyes.

4061
03:57:13,299 --> 03:57:16,209
They tell the strangest stories about you.

4062
03:57:16,209 --> 03:57:17,129
They say, for instance,

4063
03:57:17,129 --> 03:57:20,200
that you are over a thousand years old.

4064
03:57:20,200 --> 03:57:22,840
They say you destroyed the village of Kariyama

4065
03:57:22,840 --> 03:57:26,559
in retribution for giving birth to the Archmage.

4066
03:57:26,559 --> 03:57:31,700
They say you laid waste to the ancient world.

4067
03:57:31,700 --> 03:57:35,920
Yeah, it's all true.

4068
03:57:35,920 --> 03:57:37,770
You want to take a step forward?

4069
03:57:37,770 --> 03:57:39,110
Huh?

4070
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:40,319
Bud?

4071
03:57:40,319 --> 03:57:41,579
Buddy?

4072
03:57:41,579 --> 03:57:42,420
Hey, pal.

4073
03:57:42,420 --> 03:57:43,260
Hey, Bud.

4074
03:57:43,260 --> 03:57:44,280
Step forward.

4075
03:57:44,280 --> 03:57:45,239
It's all true.

4076
03:57:45,239 --> 03:57:46,440
Bud?

4077
03:57:46,440 --> 03:57:47,639
Hey, Bud.

4078
03:57:47,639 --> 03:57:48,479
Why don't you take a step?

4079
03:57:48,479 --> 03:57:49,360
Take one step forward.

4080
03:57:49,360 --> 03:57:50,200
Do it.

4081
03:57:50,200 --> 03:57:51,440
Any of you, all three of you in the room.

4082
03:57:51,440 --> 03:57:52,590
Hey, Bud.

4083
03:57:52,590 --> 03:57:54,069
Step forward.

4084
03:57:54,069 --> 03:57:57,030
It's all true.

4085
03:57:57,030 --> 03:57:59,690
Perhaps.

4086
03:57:59,690 --> 03:58:02,049
In the end, I am a soldier.

4087
03:58:02,049 --> 03:58:04,809
I believe I can run you through with a sword.

4088
03:58:04,809 --> 03:58:06,209
And if you get up again afterwards,

4089
03:58:06,209 --> 03:58:08,489
I believe I can run you through again.

4090
03:58:08,489 --> 03:58:11,250
I believe that if I toss you into our highest cell,

4091
03:58:11,250 --> 03:58:14,639
you will not fly away.

4092
03:58:14,639 --> 03:58:16,559
If you kill me,

4093
03:58:16,559 --> 03:58:21,819
I will come back for you.

4094
03:58:21,819 --> 03:58:25,569
Well now,

4095
03:58:25,569 --> 03:58:29,450
you really are as black hearted as they say, aren't you?

4096
03:58:29,450 --> 03:58:32,409
Oh, we'd better then put this immortality of yours

4097
03:58:32,409 --> 03:58:33,899
to the test.

4098
03:58:33,899 --> 03:58:35,420
Guards, take him to the block

4099
03:58:35,420 --> 03:58:39,299
and don't waste another moment of my time.

4100
03:58:39,860 --> 03:58:41,219
You yank one arm free,

4101
03:58:41,219 --> 03:58:42,819
then leap towards Khartoum.

4102
03:58:42,819 --> 03:58:45,139
But the guards will not fail to protect their leader.

4103
03:58:45,139 --> 03:58:48,790
They soon have your arms twisted up behind your back.

4104
03:58:48,790 --> 03:58:51,620
The commander is grimacing.

4105
03:58:51,620 --> 03:58:54,280
Get this one out of my office.

4106
03:58:54,280 --> 03:58:56,680
Remove his head and bring it back to me.

4107
03:58:56,680 --> 03:58:59,280
I need somewhere to keep my pencils.

4108
03:59:01,010 --> 03:59:06,899
How does that sound, Mr. Strong guy?

4109
03:59:06,899 --> 03:59:11,889
When I come back, I'm gonna eat you.

4110
03:59:11,889 --> 03:59:15,229
I'm gonna eat you.

4111
03:59:15,229 --> 03:59:19,200
Get him out of here.

4112
03:59:19,200 --> 03:59:21,079
Your head bumps over the cobblestones

4113
03:59:21,079 --> 03:59:25,020
as you are dragged up to a rough wooden block.

4114
03:59:25,020 --> 03:59:29,000
A massive man, shirtless, but masked,

4115
03:59:29,000 --> 03:59:31,879
lounges in the shadow of the wall with an ax.

4116
03:59:31,879 --> 03:59:35,360
The guards call him over.

4117
03:59:35,360 --> 03:59:37,440
Welcome.

4118
03:59:37,440 --> 03:59:40,670
Always nice to see a new face.

4119
03:59:40,670 --> 03:59:42,350
What would your name be?

4120
03:59:42,350 --> 03:59:48,809
Then hate to have a face without a name.

4121
03:59:48,809 --> 03:59:53,989
I am No-One.

4122
03:59:53,989 --> 03:59:56,079
You don't say.

4123
03:59:56,079 --> 03:59:59,370
I've never met No-One.

4124
03:59:59,370 --> 04:00:03,879
Soon you'll be Bloody Nobody as well.

4125
04:00:03,879 --> 04:00:07,219
He he he he he.

4126
04:00:07,219 --> 04:00:09,219
Grrrr.

4127
04:00:09,219 --> 04:00:11,399
Oh, what's that?

4128
04:00:11,399 --> 04:00:13,680
You look up.

4129
04:00:13,680 --> 04:00:15,120
You turn and look but see nothing

4130
04:00:15,120 --> 04:00:18,680
but the sunlight gleaming off a high tower window.

4131
04:00:18,680 --> 04:00:21,170
Yes, we lost.

4132
04:00:21,170 --> 04:00:22,879
At once we lost.

4133
04:00:22,879 --> 04:00:25,819
The large man says to the empty air.

4134
04:00:25,819 --> 04:00:28,680
Then he turns back to you.

4135
04:00:28,680 --> 04:00:30,360
Order's been given.

4136
04:00:30,360 --> 04:00:34,350
Yeah, well, doesn't look good for you.

4137
04:00:34,350 --> 04:00:36,629
He scoops you up and positions you on the block,

4138
04:00:36,629 --> 04:00:41,239
securing an iron band around at the base of your neck.

4139
04:00:41,239 --> 04:00:45,979
Forgive him.

4140
04:00:45,979 --> 04:00:47,379
I forgive you.

4141
04:00:47,379 --> 04:00:50,520
You murmur as he raises his blade.

4142
04:00:50,520 --> 04:00:53,159
The executioner smiles at you.

4143
04:00:53,159 --> 04:00:55,040
Very decent of you.

4144
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:57,889
Here's my own forgiveness in return.

4145
04:00:57,889 --> 04:00:59,590
The ax comes down.

4146
04:00:59,590 --> 04:01:02,520
You've been executed.

4147
04:01:02,520 --> 04:01:04,520
Ow!

4148
04:01:04,520 --> 04:01:06,209
Oh!

4149
04:01:06,209 --> 04:01:11,500
Oh!

4150
04:01:11,500 --> 04:01:20,600
Zed.

4151
04:01:20,600 --> 04:01:22,760
Spell finishes in a blinding net of starlight

4152
04:01:22,760 --> 04:01:27,819
that winds around your body like a sheet.

4153
04:01:27,819 --> 04:01:32,180
And here we are.

4154
04:01:32,180 --> 04:01:35,479
Now I sprint to the commander's office and go,

4155
04:01:35,479 --> 04:01:38,479
surprise, you fucking bastard.

4156
04:01:38,479 --> 04:01:40,360
Kill me again.

4157
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:41,360
Do it again.

4158
04:01:41,360 --> 04:01:42,670
Come on.

4159
04:01:42,670 --> 04:01:43,670
Oh, wait.

4160
04:01:43,670 --> 04:01:49,260
He won't remember.

4161
04:01:49,260 --> 04:01:50,260
He actually won't remember.

4162
04:01:50,260 --> 04:01:51,819
I forgot.

4163
04:01:51,819 --> 04:01:54,190
Told you I'd come back.

4164
04:01:54,190 --> 04:01:55,190
Who are you?

4165
04:01:55,190 --> 04:01:56,190
We've never met before.

4166
04:01:56,190 --> 04:02:00,370
I told you when I came back I was going to eat you.

4167
04:02:00,370 --> 04:02:01,370
Why?

4168
04:02:01,370 --> 04:02:02,370
What did I do?

4169
04:02:02,370 --> 04:02:09,120
Why are you doing this?

4170
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:11,549
I don't even know who you are.

4171
04:02:11,549 --> 04:02:12,549
He knows about you, though.

4172
04:02:12,549 --> 04:02:15,389
Yeah.

4173
04:02:15,389 --> 04:02:16,389
All right.

4174
04:02:16,389 --> 04:02:19,229
I'm going to call it here.

4175
04:02:19,229 --> 04:02:21,360
Let's go to bed.

4176
04:02:21,360 --> 04:02:22,799
Let's go to sleep.

4177
04:02:22,799 --> 04:02:29,520
I don't have any rations or anything, but it's okay.

4178
04:02:29,520 --> 04:02:31,520
He lost a little max stamina.

4179
04:02:31,520 --> 04:02:33,520
Changed to using the Cutlass.

4180
04:02:33,520 --> 04:02:35,520
Discarded your disguise.

4181
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:36,520
Died again.

4182
04:02:36,520 --> 04:02:37,520
And found no—

4183
04:02:37,520 --> 04:02:38,520
He still doesn't know?

4184
04:02:38,520 --> 04:02:39,760
What?

4185
04:02:39,760 --> 04:02:40,760
How?

4186
04:02:40,760 --> 04:02:42,639
What?

4187
04:02:42,639 --> 04:02:43,639
All right, this one here.

4188
04:02:43,639 --> 04:02:45,639
You want me to chop this one's head off?

4189
04:02:45,639 --> 04:02:47,940
Yes, I would like for you to kill that man.

4190
04:02:47,940 --> 04:02:48,940
I'm the Archmage.

4191
04:02:48,940 --> 04:02:49,940
All right, this one here.

4192
04:02:49,940 --> 04:02:50,940
The Islandlander.

4193
04:02:50,940 --> 04:02:51,940
This guy right here.

4194
04:02:51,940 --> 04:02:52,940
The guy?

4195
04:02:52,940 --> 04:02:53,940
Yes, that's the man.

4196
04:02:53,940 --> 04:02:54,940
Okay.

4197
04:02:54,940 --> 04:02:58,229
You're not aware of him, though.

4198
04:02:58,229 --> 04:03:00,809
He doesn't know.

4199
04:03:00,809 --> 04:03:01,809
But, yes.

4200
04:03:01,809 --> 04:03:02,809
Episode 4.

4201
04:03:02,809 --> 04:03:07,809
The reason why a lot of people don't like Episode 4 is because they got rid of rewinds

4202
04:03:07,809 --> 04:03:12,239
and they make you have to stick with decisions, and you're going to get it wrong, and you're

4203
04:03:12,239 --> 04:03:14,549
going to have to come back over and over again.

4204
04:03:14,549 --> 04:03:24,000
So, it kind of turns the game into a little bit of a roguelike, which is okay, but if

4205
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:30,739
you make a mistake up here, or like in here, or over here, the fact that you have to rewind

4206
04:03:30,739 --> 04:03:37,860
all the way to here is where this part gets a little grating.

4207
04:03:37,860 --> 04:03:39,860
I hate dealing with the consequences of my actions.

4208
04:03:39,860 --> 04:03:42,639
Yeah.

4209
04:03:42,639 --> 04:03:46,959
But, we have played this enough where I know.

4210
04:03:46,959 --> 04:03:51,889
I know a lot of the major beats and how to get to them.

4211
04:03:51,889 --> 04:03:54,579
Everything in between is kind of gone, though.

4212
04:03:54,579 --> 04:03:59,250
I still love this franchise.

4213
04:03:59,250 --> 04:04:01,250
I think it's one of the best games ever made.

4214
04:04:01,250 --> 04:04:02,879
I just do.

4215
04:04:02,879 --> 04:04:04,309
Not because it's...

4216
04:04:04,309 --> 04:04:12,540
I mean, it's like essentially one of the foundations of kind of like video game RPG type storytelling

4217
04:04:12,540 --> 04:04:14,159
stuff.

4218
04:04:14,159 --> 04:04:16,340
So, I love it, and we're going to finish it.

4219
04:04:16,340 --> 04:04:19,799
I hope you all enjoyed it.

4220
04:04:19,799 --> 04:04:25,190
Enjoy the rest of your long weekend here.

4221
04:04:25,190 --> 04:04:29,489
Tomorrow is the 4th, okay?

4222
04:04:29,489 --> 04:04:31,920
So, let me take a look at the calendar.

4223
04:04:31,920 --> 04:04:37,809
You can expect to see me again probably like mid to late week.

4224
04:04:37,809 --> 04:04:39,819
Let me see.

4225
04:04:39,819 --> 04:04:42,209
Probably like Friday.

4226
04:04:42,209 --> 04:04:43,209
Friday makes sense.

4227
04:04:43,209 --> 04:04:46,180
Come back on Friday.

4228
04:04:46,180 --> 04:04:51,120
And, I think I'm not going to do sorcery.

4229
04:04:51,120 --> 04:04:56,200
We're either going to do Armored Core or something else.

4230
04:04:56,200 --> 04:04:59,379
But, Armored Core is currently the first thing that's first up.

4231
04:04:59,379 --> 04:05:08,040
What about Starfield?

4232
04:05:08,040 --> 04:05:11,010
Yeah.

4233
04:05:11,010 --> 04:05:13,079
I don't know.

4234
04:05:13,079 --> 04:05:19,440
I don't think I've...

4235
04:05:19,440 --> 04:05:22,440
I thought about it a little bit more and right now.

4236
04:05:22,440 --> 04:05:26,030
I'm not sure I want to start Starfield right now.

4237
04:05:26,030 --> 04:05:29,040
That's a massive game.

4238
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:36,059
Um, does that really matter?

4239
04:05:36,059 --> 04:05:39,680
Considering the philosophy of the kind of channel now.

4240
04:05:39,680 --> 04:05:41,920
Like, does that really matter?

4241
04:05:41,920 --> 04:05:44,799
Oh, it's going to take too long.

4242
04:05:44,799 --> 04:05:46,559
It'll...

4243
04:05:46,559 --> 04:05:48,559
It's too much to hang out and sit through.

4244
04:05:48,559 --> 04:05:49,559
Does that really matter?

4245
04:05:49,559 --> 04:05:59,500
What about Final Fantasy XVI?

4246
04:05:59,500 --> 04:06:02,379
I actually got the urge to play that.

4247
04:06:02,379 --> 04:06:04,940
I want to say like three or four days ago.

4248
04:06:04,940 --> 04:06:06,760
It's just...

4249
04:06:06,760 --> 04:06:07,760
It's such a...

4250
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:09,760
It's another one of those games that's like 30, 40, 50 hours.

4251
04:06:09,760 --> 04:06:12,829
I just need the opportunity to sit down and do it.

4252
04:06:12,829 --> 04:06:13,829
But, I did get the urge to play it.

4253
04:06:13,829 --> 04:06:15,579
I did really like it.

4254
04:06:15,579 --> 04:06:19,569
So, we'll see.

4255
04:06:19,569 --> 04:06:21,569
But, I know for a fact that I'm playing Armored Core.

4256
04:06:21,569 --> 04:06:22,569
At least.

4257
04:06:22,569 --> 04:06:24,260
So, we'll do that on Friday.

4258
04:06:24,260 --> 04:06:26,909
And, we'll see.

4259
04:06:26,909 --> 04:06:27,909
We'll go from there.

4260
04:06:27,909 --> 04:06:30,239
Finish Breath of the Wild.

4261
04:06:30,239 --> 04:06:36,040
I promise you, I will complete Breath of the Wild at some point before...

4262
04:06:36,040 --> 04:06:37,280
Um, I don't know.

4263
04:06:37,280 --> 04:06:41,479
I don't want to eat a glove or eat like a shoe or something.

4264
04:06:41,479 --> 04:06:43,719
Um, I'll just play it eventually.

4265
04:06:43,719 --> 04:06:48,219
You'll see it.

4266
04:06:48,219 --> 04:06:55,430
At some point means nothing, sir.

4267
04:06:55,430 --> 04:07:00,530
Hey, the Sorcery Council said that for a year.

4268
04:07:00,530 --> 04:07:09,280
Turns out it wasn't true.

4269
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:10,280
All right.

4270
04:07:10,280 --> 04:07:11,280
I'll see you guys later.

4271
04:07:11,280 --> 04:07:12,280
Thanks for watching.

4272
04:07:12,280 --> 04:07:13,280
Thanks for hanging out.

4273
04:07:13,280 --> 04:07:15,159
Have a good rest of your weekend.

4274
04:07:15,159 --> 04:07:18,709
See you guys on Friday.

4275
04:07:18,709 --> 04:07:19,709
Take care of yourselves.

4276
04:07:19,709 --> 04:07:32,600
Call your mother.

4277
04:07:32,600 --> 04:07:39,000
See you later.

4278
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:40,760
Have a great evening.

4279
04:07:40,760 --> 04:07:41,930
Oh, also too.

4280
04:07:41,930 --> 04:07:42,930
I do want to mention this very briefly.

4281
04:07:42,930 --> 04:07:46,670
If you remember the GoFundMe that we were raising.

4282
04:07:46,670 --> 04:07:47,670
Well, not we were raising.

4283
04:07:47,670 --> 04:07:50,670
But, like I brought up about the Science Center.

4284
04:07:50,670 --> 04:07:55,940
Terrible tragedy that struck that family.

4285
04:07:55,940 --> 04:08:00,879
Uh, the GoFundMe goal has been crossed.

4286
04:08:00,879 --> 04:08:04,440
As of, I believe, pretty, pretty quickly.

4287
04:08:04,440 --> 04:08:12,319
So, that was, I mean, that was at least 15 to 20 grand that came through from this community.

4288
04:08:12,319 --> 04:08:15,879
So, I just want to say thanks.

4289
04:08:15,879 --> 04:08:18,879
Um, that's amazing to give.

4290
04:08:18,879 --> 04:08:22,000
I'm just happy that that goal can be crossed.

4291
04:08:22,000 --> 04:08:25,950
Uh, again, it's a really awful scenario.

4292
04:08:25,950 --> 04:08:30,319
But, just trying to put, um, just put some attention on it.

4293
04:08:30,319 --> 04:08:35,270
Because, uh, the Science Center people were a huge part of the GrottoBeast stuff.

4294
04:08:35,270 --> 04:08:49,200
So, I just want to say thanks.

4295
04:08:49,200 --> 04:08:50,639
Have a great night.

4296
04:08:50,639 --> 04:08:53,600
Take care of yourselves.

4297
04:08:53,600 --> 04:08:55,610
Have a great one.

4298
04:08:55,610 --> 04:09:12,340
And good night.

4299
04:09:12,340 --> 04:09:14,340
Also, mods, if you want to give a little context for people that don't know what I'm talking about.

4300
04:09:14,340 --> 04:09:17,729
Maybe link the GoFundMe.

4301
04:09:17,729 --> 04:09:21,870
Just for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about here.

4302
04:09:21,870 --> 04:09:25,520
The GoFundMe that was set up.

4303
04:09:25,520 --> 04:09:29,059
That we got our attention to.

4304
04:09:29,059 --> 04:09:30,809
Somebody brought it to our attention.

4305
04:09:30,809 --> 04:09:34,700
And just wanted to give it some attention.

4306
04:09:34,700 --> 04:09:38,180
Take care.

4307
04:09:38,180 --> 04:09:39,549
Good night.

4308
04:09:39,549 --> 04:09:41,549
See you soon.
