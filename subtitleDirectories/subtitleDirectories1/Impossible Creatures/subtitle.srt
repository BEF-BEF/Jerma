1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,660
I don't know. I don't know if I like that. No, there's something wrong here. There's

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,579
something wrong. It's the elephant. It's not, I know elephant. It's got to be something

3
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:29,059
else. Giraffe. Now that's what I'm talking about. That is the perfect animal. Yeah. Hey,

4
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:35,789
what are you doing over here? Click on him and look at his name. What is that? Look at

5
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:46,619
its name. Do you remember in real life? XD. What is that? Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?

6
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:54,380
Yeah. No. Get out of here. This is a giraffe. Skunk turf. Get the fuck out of here. I don't

7
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:00,619
think you could have hurt him. Can I not kill this? Get out of here. He's too awesome. Come

8
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:13,549
help me long guy. I need help from long guy. What do you mean long guy? Is that a dachshund?

9
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,069
Ready boss. You're the boss. No building is up. Somebody's cheating. Building's done. Oh,

10
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:33,659
really? Thanks for the heads up. No. Stop. Just stay here. Just stay here.

11
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:40,780
Can I do anything? Can I do any funny moves? Where are my funny moves?

12
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,579
One of these times you're going to spawn there and it's going to kill you.

13
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,650
That's not fair. No, it's really not. And what the hell are you two doing?

14
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:04,459
You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter. Kill him. No, kill him. Kill the disappearing

15
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:12,270
shark shithead. He's dead. No, you got him. I did not kill him. He is very much alive.

16
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:25,219
See, I told you he was alive. Okay, nice. How am I supposed to win? I can't. Stop. Let them

17
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,740
have a fight. You're not supposed to just let them die. That was all the fight I had.

18
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:46,669
The Quillers are under attack. Come on. What is that thing? What? You don't like,

19
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:58,400
you don't appreciate the meta. What meta? The overlord scouting meta. I don't think I understand

20
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,180
this joke. That's a whale bee. What is the overlord? No, he's like a zerg. You send your overlord out

21
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,599
to scout first. I didn't play Starcraft. I don't play Starcraft. I have not played Starcraft enough

22
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:22,180
to know what that is. I think everyone who has ever played a video game at the very least knows

23
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:30,960
what a fucking zerg rush is. Yeah. Well, that's not. Here comes my zerglings. I wasn't even ready.

24
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,129
Come on. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Your overarching theme. I get it. You're doing a

25
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:52,509
Starcraft thing with your turtle bugs. That's really great. It is really great. Get the fuck

26
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:56,990
out of here. Get this thing and get your overlord and fucking stuff it up your ass.

27
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:03,729
He says he's coming with himself. We have plenty of units. We have the strangest animal

28
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:11,259
the whole time. Those people. I love how my, they're not even attacking. Attack them. Kill them.

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,930
Kill the people. This is so shit. The Quillers are under attack. The Quillers are under attack.

30
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,810
We're not going to win. We're not going to win. Steal their coal. Steal the coal. Get out of here.

31
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:33,970
Get the coal. Come on, snake. Spit it out. Spit it out, snake. No. Start mining. Start mining.

32
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,490
Everyone mine it. I would have figured these guys would be dead way longer ago.

33
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:47,089
They are getting eaten by giant crocodile bears. He's getting out with the coal. Where are all the

34
00:04:47,170 --> 00:05:01,279
sound effects? We're taking this into the base. We are taking this shit into the base after you

35
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:09,040
kill them, Darren. Go for it, Darren. The fights in this are so anticlimactic. Kill them all, Darren.

36
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,720
That's right. Who is Darren? Very good, Darren. Very good job, Darren. You thought you could

37
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,879
mess with the Darons. You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darons. I didn't think I

38
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,600
could. Come on, Darren. You've got this, Darren. He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying

39
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:41,649
Manchester. Does he know who you are? You're fucking Darren. No. Darren. For centuries. I don't know

40
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:49,699
how to start this. How do you start this? I don't know. What are we fighting for? I would like to

41
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:56,620
speak with your leader. Yes. The other leader. The other one. We have plenty of leaders.

42
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,939
When one goes down, the other will take his place. I need at least one. There's another one right

43
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,420
here. There's another leader. Would you like to see a new one? This is also a leader.

44
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:17,149
Yeah, see, one of your guys we caught the other day, he was on our sand and we agreed that was ours.

45
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:22,589
We had a treaty 2,000 years ago, your people and our people, that this bridge shall never be

46
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:28,110
crossed unless for diplomatic reasons. We're crossing it right now. We caught one of your...

47
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We did not cross the bridge. What are you going to do about it?

48
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,990
What are you going to do about it? That is an act of war. That is an act. You back up or that is an act of

49
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:57,790
war. What did you say? Nuclear transform. I don't know.
