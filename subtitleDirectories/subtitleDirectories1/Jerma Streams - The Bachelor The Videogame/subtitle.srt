1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:11,050
So, I bought this shit. I know this game sucks, but when am I going to do this? There is no

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:17,030
opportunity for me to put this in. Zero. I don't have any other chance to play this right now.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,019
It's the only time it's going to happen. Otherwise it's just going to sit there,

4
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:25,539
and I know it's going to be terrible. It's not even going to be funny. It's going to be such a

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:34,009
shit game. It's the bachelor video game for the Wii. I've been trying to find a place to put this

6
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:43,429
on stream, and I can't. It's so bad. When it's three hours, I'm thinking like probably like

7
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:50,549
another couple hours on this. I don't know. I have to play this. I bought it. What do you say?

8
00:00:50,549 --> 00:01:02,490
Well, I have no other opportunity. This is it. This is the opportunity. I've got my opportunity

9
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:13,829
right here. Let's change it up. That's your fault. Yeah, but okay. Let me level with it here. I'm

10
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:17,989
not going to start a stream with the bachelor for Wii. You know what I mean? This is like a

11
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:22,409
put this in for 10 minutes, and have everybody tell me this game is horrible. Please do something

12
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:37,319
else. To a point where the spam is uncontrollable, and I'm forced to change games, right? 10 hours.

13
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,799
All right, here we go. Let me make sure this is actually accurate, because the GameCube actually

14
00:01:43,799 --> 00:02:13,979
pulls the screen differently. I already hate this. I already don't want to do this. Okay,

15
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:21,560
I probably don't need the nunchuck, but... And guess what we're doing? We're going on camera for this,

16
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,960
because I have to hold the Wii mode in my hand, and I probably have to go,

17
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:28,599
catch the fucking flies with your fucking net, right? So I have to do it like this. So we're

18
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:37,319
going to be on camera. All right, by the way, remember, the Wii processes the data through

19
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,280
the capture card differently, so it might be a little different. Let's check this out. Ready?

20
00:02:43,319 --> 00:03:00,919
We all right? Let's see if I have to change it. I have to move the resolution a little bit, because

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:11,560
see how bad it looks. Actually, it's not that bad. You can pull it out a little bit.

22
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:47,370
That's hard. I'm trying just to see. It's hard to see. I could have changed this game title.

23
00:03:50,650 --> 00:04:01,349
Is somebody naked? Oh, this is the product of the Wii being the most popular console

24
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:15,719
ever, and your grandparents potentially owning it. I can't believe this is even a game that's

25
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:23,540
on here. The Bachelor. I can't even click it. I have typed in the Bachelo. The Bachelor

26
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:35,819
I can't even click the fucking game. Does it say the Bachelor? This was on the DS. How? All right,

27
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,939
select a contestant. Well, I've, I've, I've, that's, I've, I don't, I mean, that's me already done,

28
00:04:42,250 --> 00:05:14,060
and I'm a movie producer. I can't change that. Love test. I kind of want to do the love test.

29
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:29,430
Personality quiz. Let's do the personality quiz. It's complete season one. Okay, the dating style

30
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,670
quiz. Okay, how do you make a first impression? I like to dress in style. Nope, I went jogging

31
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,829
pants and like cut off t-shirts everywhere. A warm smile and hello works for me. Nope, that's not,

32
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:51,639
also not true because I smile like this. So no, that's inaccurate. Be respectful and show up on

33
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,279
time. I'm late to everything. I've never showed up on time to do a single thing in my whole life.

34
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,319
Arrive with flowers and chocolates in hand. I'm never prepared for anything.

35
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,879
So I would, that's, none of these are accurate. What happens if I don't do any of these?

36
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:33,339
Whatever. Season one. It's Jerma and Diana Pappas. How do you play this game?

37
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,829
It's going to be, it's the party games. It has to be. It's on the Wii. It's going to be party games.

38
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:53,300
Are you guys at a funeral? No, you're the bachelor with your host, Chris Harrison.

39
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,459
Okay, why am I so sad?

40
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,100
This character just turned and just fucking just blasted the other guy.

41
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:26,870
Welcome back, Diana Pappas. Holy shit, they say the name. Oh my God. I thought it was going to be

42
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,370
like, please welcome back our contestant. Before we begin, I can provide a for the game.

43
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:44,420
Yes, let's, how does this work? You participate in a series of dates. Let's go on dates. Each one

44
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,500
has an exciting challenge to be met and will be your chance to impress the bachelor.

45
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,180
Kissing under a restaurant table. You know that this is, this is, oh, you could, it's okay to do

46
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:03,100
that at dinner up top. This is not that Disney dog movie that this is okay where you're humans.

47
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay, depending on the type of date card you receive, you'll either go on a group date

48
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:20,060
or a one-on-one date. What do you mean go on a group date? Group dates involve everyone

49
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:28,709
while one-on-one dates. Why would you go on a group date? The instructions on how to play are

50
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:38,139
explained on each date card. You can also warm up by selecting practice. Oh, this is like dealing

51
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,019
with somebody that has to plan everything, like obsessive compulsively. Oh, did you get your date

52
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,220
card? Did you get your date card that explains everything about what's going to happen on our

53
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:55,399
date? Like, um, I have to go, my entire family has got hit by a car. It's like, oh, okay, sorry,

54
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,519
I gotta get out of here. You'll earn heart points based on your performance. The better you do,

55
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:09,139
the more hearts you'll collect. Sometimes the bachelorette will even send out small

56
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,659
floating hearts. And I gotta catch it. Catching any of these will improve your odds with her.

57
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:18,519
I knew it. I told you we were gonna get like a net to have to catch things. However, not everyone

58
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,559
will make it. During the rose ceremony, the contestant with the least number of hearts

59
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:29,639
will be eliminated. No, I will not marry you. It's not happening. Along with his dream of

60
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:35,000
marrying the bachelorette. Isn't this some statistic somewhere that, so, what a great,

61
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,159
uh, little slide here. Along with the dream of marrying the bachelorette. The boy with, oh,

62
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,360
I choose you. We're dating now. Where we love each other. Isn't this some statistic that

63
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,639
none of them ever work out? You get to the very end and they stop dating within like three days.

64
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,379
That happens almost every single time. Why do people still watch this show?

65
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:07,080
Are we all ready for the first date? I wish you all the best. Let the journey begin. Let's go.

66
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:20,649
All right, first date card. What's it gonna say? Group date in the hot air balloon. The skies are

67
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,610
all clear for lift off. Let's get these air balloons up in the air. Don't get left on the ground.

68
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,779
We have to take an individual balloon? Who could inflate their air balloon the fastest? Pressing

69
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:35,860
a hold. Do we have to do it? Wait, don't we hire a company to do this? Press and hold the A button

70
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,940
on the Wii remote to keep the needle inside the green margin to inflate your balloon.

71
00:10:41,059 --> 00:11:07,559
I don't even know which one I am. Top left? This is it. Get that heart. Got it. Oh, that's hard.

72
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:24,120
I got an extra heart. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm tied first. What is it? What does this guy

73
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:37,590
below me have? Six? Seven. I gotta get, I gotta get there first. I don't know why this makes me want

74
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,419
to scream. Okay, I'm good. I did it. I don't know why it makes me want to fucking scream when I was

75
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:48,279
doing that. I was just like, I want to like get energy out of me. I hate that. I hated that. Okay,

76
00:11:48,279 --> 00:12:03,059
I win. Jerma, Nate, Simon and Keith all going for the same love. It actually is just, is Mario

77
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:09,860
Party. Now I have to drive a car. Automatic plus one letter grid. It's time for some off-road racing.

78
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,820
Yeah, if we have that rule, we have to use it whenever it's available.

79
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:22,120
Um, I don't make those rules. Who will finish first in the off-road race? Point at your vehicle

80
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:29,340
with the Wii mode and hold down the A button while moving left and right to navigate the race

81
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,629
course. What do I mean? Hold, point at your vehicle. Why would I not do this like every other Wii game?

82
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:54,940
Are you kidding me? This is a game. This is a game already. This exists. It's like an old one.

83
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,980
You know, where have I, I'm seeing, you know what I'm saying? Well, you know, this is a game that

84
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,049
does this already and it's an old one. It's a physical thing you do this with. It's hurting

85
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:18,309
my head to think about this. I need to know what that is. I had one of these. Yeah, I did too.

86
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:42,340
None of these guys get in the extra hearts. Um, this is awful. This is awful, awful, awful, awful.

87
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:54,539
I'm still going to beat it and I'm still going to get first place on that date.

88
00:13:55,259 --> 00:14:03,210
You bet your ass. I'm going to get that one-on-one date.

89
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:16,980
Ice skates. Does she, does she come with us? Or is she just standing, like, just stand up here?

90
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:24,279
Who can collect hexagons the fastest? Press and hold the A button anywhere on the ice to mark

91
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,000
hexagons. The longer you hold, the more hexagons you mark. Release the A button to collect

92
00:14:31,000 --> 00:15:04,820
your hexagons. Why is nobody doing anything? Oh, I get it. That motherfucker got so lucky.

93
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:21,029
Oh, come on. Do it. I'm going to get this whole corner right now. The whole thing. Get the fuck

94
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:31,269
out of my way. Got it. It's not going to hit me. I'm going to be able to get this whole thing.

95
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:26,139
Two, three. Got it. It's going to go underneath. Oh, am I in the lead? Take this whole corner.

96
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:34,700
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Why do I care? This is the worst minigame.

97
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,429
Spare us from this hell. No, I'm interested. It takes five minutes for me to realize if it was

98
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:44,789
worth doing. It's worth doing. I'm interested. I'm going to get that one-on-one date and then

99
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:48,389
we're taking the, we're taking all the, I'm beating the whole game. No, why did I say that?

100
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,629
I'm not doing that. I'll be probably like a tenth of the game.

101
00:16:50,629 --> 00:17:09,640
Why was this on the, why was this on the coke? What is this? What is that?

102
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:44,680
It's not a tooth. It's not a tooth. That fucking tooth just comes up. It just like falls out.

103
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,529
All right. Let's get, let's take some shots. For each mystery photo, be the first to answer

104
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,690
the question. All right. So we have to find out what the mystery photo is.

105
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:17,559
Ready? How many chairs are in this picture? You guys are so slow. Bachelor is holding her

106
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:32,730
by the shoulders, torso by the arms. The contestant at the far right is holding

107
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,339
cheese, a spatula. It's going to be, oh, he got it wrong. Fuck. How do you guys know this?

108
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:56,920
In this picture, Brad is drinking wine. Drinking wine. Fuck. Pouring wine. In this picture,

109
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,630
the people are not, it's definitely not playing baseball. They're writing, eating,

110
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:27,130
making a toast. Eating. What is in this photo? Floating restaurant. Yeah. In this picture,

111
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,009
we can see a pair of sandals and a plastic beetroot. A plastic beetroot is in a bottle of

112
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:33,130
sunscreen. A bottle of sunscreen and a pair of sandals in a bottle of sunscreen. This one.

113
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:53,980
That's it. How many wine glasses are on the table? Two, three, four, or eight. Where was this picture

114
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:01,819
taken? In a bathroom. In the desert. On the beach. I'm winning, motherfuckers. I'm getting that one

115
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:07,420
on one date. In this picture, the female contestant is wearing a brown dress, blue, red, and yellow

116
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:27,000
dress. Oh. Oh, you got me. How many female contestants are wearing sunglasses? There was

117
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,019
no way to discern what was going on in that photo. Not possible. What's in the foreground?

118
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:52,700
The beach. In the background, we can see the sea. A road. Snowfall. A wall. A wall. It's a

119
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,559
snow. A wall. The sea. It's just a Truman Show? That's not what the sea looks like in the background.

120
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,799
That's a fucking Truman Show wall. The female contestants' eyes are looking at. Her eyes are

121
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:09,500
closed. His mouth. I think they're looking at his eye. His mouth. His mouth. Yeah, I thought they

122
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:18,519
were kissing. Her eyes are closed. The couple is looking at the sunset. Roasting marshmallows.

123
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:32,519
Kissing. Swimming. Gonna be looking at the sunset. They are not kissing in that photo. Zoom the fuck

124
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,940
in. They were at least three or four inches away from each other's faces. From the left, the yellow

125
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:45,029
surfboard is fourth. Alright, gotta get one more. One more. In this picture, the man is playing golf.

126
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:53,529
Cutting grass. Playing baseball. Cutting grass. Cutting grass. Playing golf. How did I come in?

127
00:21:53,529 --> 00:22:09,769
How? I got five questions first. Whatever, I got more hearts anyways. You didn't catch enough. I win.

128
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,700
One-on-one date. A one-on-one date invitation has arrived. Who is it for? It's for me.

129
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:39,079
Jerma, you're going on a one-on-one date. Jerma, you're in Smash Brothers. The Bachelorette chose

130
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:45,220
you and she would like to keep the intimacy going. She's waiting for you here with a finest.

131
00:22:45,940 --> 00:23:03,130
Okay, here we go. Oh, it's a fucking ugly couch. Why do they look like YouTube Kids animated

132
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,619
characters? I feel like suddenly we're going to start singing about like eating your carrots

133
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:13,829
and peas and shit over and over again. Point at each falling feather with the Wii mode. Press

134
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:25,450
A on them before they reach the bottom. Wait, is this? Why are there other people here? Get the

135
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:40,180
fuck out of here. This is my date. Oh, they're the ones dropping them. Okay, it's hard to aim

136
00:23:40,180 --> 00:24:20,920
when you're scrunched up like I am. I win. I win. Does that mean that I win the game?

137
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:54,250
Another one-on-one date? I get two one-on-one dates in a row?

138
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,079
If you don't get a rose. I know I'm getting a rose.

139
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:09,990
Bonus hearts. Yeah, I win. It's impossible. Will you accept this rose?

140
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:23,029
You did it. Of course I did. Why are you sad about that? That means you get to keep going.

141
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:30,250
Why would you be sad about getting a rose? Why would you be? Eight hearts.

142
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,900
This guy was on his phone half of these mini games. He wouldn't even try it.

143
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,950
That was Binding of Isaac music. Everything is Binding of Isaac. Everything, apparently.

144
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:59,740
Everything. Next round of dates? Wait, that was an entire season. Congratulations,

145
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,900
you unlocked Close to You. The Caring and Kindness Quiz. I can't wait to take all these quizzes.

146
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:18,420
Oh no, that was just episode one. Okay. Oh man, we gotta do more of these. I'm gonna stomach this,

147
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:29,799
I think. I want to do these quizzes. It's the same- oh yeah, it's the same person.

148
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:38,819
Who can solve each puzzle the fastest? Bullfrog. Bullfrog. This is imitating a bullfrog.

149
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:42,740
Grasp each puzzle piece with the A button on the Wii mode and release them on the puzzle

150
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:51,460
outline to complete the picture. To complete the puzzle. Um, are we doing it together?

151
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:05,779
It's one of these. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Hey, hey, hey, move, move, move. Get out of my way.

152
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:34,740
Oh, I won. I'm first place. Uh, fuck. Some of these are baits. Some of these are baits.

153
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:45,349
I just fucking had that one. Oh, he saw me do that. He saw me pick that one up and he was like,

154
00:27:45,349 --> 00:28:08,809
oh I'm gonna get that one too. Oh. Oh, we don't even finish it. Has he seen that picture?

155
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:20,180
I have not. Yes, I have. I have seen that picture. We've seen- this picture props back up like every

156
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:28,950
three or four months. I have seen it. I've seen it. Turn your light up. It's scary.

157
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:50,150
That better? All right, made it to the party. For each weight comparison, determine which drink is

158
00:28:50,150 --> 00:29:22,309
the heaviest. Okay, I have to- what? Oh, it's- oh. Oh, okay. I get it. What? Got it. Speed. Oh,

159
00:29:22,869 --> 00:30:27,589
sorry. They're so far behind. You idiot. Easy. Pretty close. That's fucking cursed. Are we at a casino?

160
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:40,569
Blackjack? Who can collect casino chips the fastest? Point at each falling chip with the

161
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:55,660
Wii mode. This is not- you can't even code in like a simple Blackjack game. This is- this is moronic.

162
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:21,930
This makes me want to scream. I don't know why. Like, the way I have to move and the way that

163
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:28,950
it's looking, I think I have to scream. Anybody ever get like that? I don't know why. Just like,

164
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:33,509
something about this whole package is like, like I want to just fucking move and scream.

165
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:47,589
I don't know what it is. The webcam's not showing the Wii mode. I'm playing on the Wii.

166
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,170
Like, yeah, you need to be able to see this information. You know what I mean? Like,

167
00:31:52,170 --> 00:32:07,619
what am I, a bad fucking screamer? Okay, you can see now, right? Okay. Who can bake a souffle the

168
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:12,700
fastest? All right, so hold the A button on the Wii mode to keep the needle inside the goal. It's

169
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:37,660
just the same game that we've done three times. This is the quickest way to fuck up any food in

170
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:46,059
your oven. Oh hey, um, honey, could you preheat the oven to 200 degrees and then turn it up to 500?

171
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:51,019
And then after two minutes put it down to 100? And then put it to 700? And then put it at 300?

172
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:07,289
Sure, what are you trying to make? Um, diarrhea tomorrow morning. Oh, okay, sure, I'll get right

173
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:27,180
on that. One-on-one. Rapidly changing temperature. One-on-one date. He's arrived. Who's it for?

174
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:45,319
Oh, it's gonna be this guy. Why not take a short rest here before continuing with the date?

175
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:50,470
Short rest? It's a beautiful sunny day after all. Is this the way the game's waiting to be telling

176
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:56,390
me to not play anymore? Nintendo Wii always did this. It really did not. It was so concerned about

177
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:05,539
you getting up and leaving. It's been 30 minutes. Get up. Stop moving. You should sit down and

178
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:25,829
read a book for a while and then come back. 20 minutes. Why not get the outline of each

179
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:30,150
image with the weave mode and just press A to start tracing? You're gonna trace every

180
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:39,829
nature image on the left side of the screen as fast as you can. I'm gonna have like shaky hands.

181
00:34:45,429 --> 00:35:03,210
What? Why is it zapping me? I thought I could cheat. I thought I could cheat. I can't cheat.

182
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:31,130
I have to scream. I can't breathe. Can somebody with like ADHD do this? This is like suffocating

183
00:36:31,130 --> 00:37:55,369
them. No, don't show them kissing. I win again. Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

184
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:01,429
too big. Too big and too bright. Too big and too bright. Too big and too bright. Too big and too

185
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:05,429
bright. Too big and too bright. I looked at that. I saw that in the rear view mirror thing and then

186
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:11,030
nope. Whatever. That's the- no it's not- I know it's gonna be one of the- it's gonna be one of those

187
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,949
things where I see that image on the top. The first thing when you type in German on 85 it's

188
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:24,699
that face where I'm going like and ohhh. I'm not going back. Yeah there's no going back.

189
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:31,340
No going back. No going back. There's no going back. There's no going back. I- I- I- I- yeah

190
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:42,119
yeah I'm just not going back. I just look like a fucking idiot. Look at fucking Bob's Burgers

191
00:38:42,119 --> 00:39:09,829
character. Hey I got the rose. It's all that matters. I know it wasn't easy but I'd like

192
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:15,590
to congratulate you on making it through. All right what personality- what personality quiz

193
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:21,269
that I unlocked now? Right you got the money matters quiz. This is the real reason for this

194
00:39:21,269 --> 00:39:28,869
game being streamed. You know that right? I could give a fuck less about everything happening here.

195
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:41,909
When we do this I care about this. I don't care about anything. I have this. I care about that.

196
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:50,329
For me you could be streaming Doki Doki. I could also not be streaming Doki Doki which

197
00:39:50,329 --> 00:40:00,389
is what I'm currently doing. Oh they're models. Who will be the first to get dressed? Memorize

198
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:06,420
the position of each fashion item. You receive a random color. Oh it's just okay it's only two.

199
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:13,019
You receive a random color. Point at any draw with the wii remote and press the A button to reveal

200
00:40:13,019 --> 00:41:00,679
items matching your color. Memorize the position of each fashion item. Oh no the hat is- no!

201
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:15,960
Holy shit how did he do so bad? How did he do so bad? I can't believe he lost.

202
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,210
You waved what? You sat like you're in a casket.

203
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:39,690
What does that even mean?

204
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:54,150
I know I know exactly what you're talking about.

205
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:34,949
Like the puzzle thing. Oh this sucks. Okay here we go. Give me that. Too slow. Too slow. Idiot.

206
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:02,409
This guy's getting so badly destroyed. It's embarrassing.

207
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,539
I just need one more. Let's let him get one. No don't let him get one. Fuck him.

208
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,260
Notice that I drink. I notice that I drink shit weird when I'm on camera.

209
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,489
It's like I'm pretending to drink it a way that I don't typically drink it.

210
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:29,369
Let's- let's get- let's pull like the cover off this and I'm gonna drink that the way that I

211
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:33,050
normally would if I was just sitting here normally. I don't know what- here we go. Ready?

212
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:49,590
Okay that was normal. What I've been doing is stuff like this. I don't know why. Like you know

213
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,349
that when you're like con- self-conscious about the way you're drinking out of a can of soda.

214
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:04,340
It's time to take a bath. Oh can we pick up some coins?

215
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:17,860
Mystery photos. I love this one. Where was this picture taken? Highway, hotel entrance, concert.

216
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:29,219
Concert. Hotel entrance. We both got it wrong. This makes no sense. Where was this picture taken?

217
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:38,730
Casino. I immediately know. Definitely. What color is the contestants dress?

218
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:59,460
White. Yep. What is this person holding? Playing cards. Pretty good hand. The spectators are waiting

219
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,739
for a ticket, holding lighters in the air, watching a movie, holding their hands in the air.

220
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:18,230
Holding their hands in the air. One more. How many female contestants are at this table?

221
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,380
How would you- how would you even know- how- there's no way to- a couple in this picture is

222
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,639
sitting on a couch in a plane in a movie theater on a park bench on a couch. Nice one. Couldn't

223
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:51,340
even just- this is five blobs at that table. The computer's good at one thing. I thought that was

224
00:45:51,340 --> 00:46:19,400
a dog. Zero. Holy shit. Not good. I did it again. All right that's just- that's just like a Photoshop

225
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,679
where you just like push my mouth up and like spread my nose up top. That's funny. It's funny.

226
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:40,599
It is. Who can- oh! Who can trace every beach image the fastest? I have to do it like this.

227
00:47:31,210 --> 00:48:11,579
I'm not kidding. I swear to god. I fucking hate those. You have to breathe.

228
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:22,780
Move the sensor further away. No, not that I do the sensor. I have to do it like-

229
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:37,639
I've already clicked this image. I've already- I've seen- I've seen it.

230
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,530
Okay I haven't seen that one. I have not- okay this one's a little different. This one's-

231
00:48:46,489 --> 00:49:12,260
I feel like I can make this face. That's fucking terrifying. This is what I feel like people that

232
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:23,449
are trying to kill me and my dreams look like. That's the image that you see. It's like not a

233
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:30,389
human but it is a human and they're like walking with it like erratically with their fucking

234
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:39,369
shoulders and shit and they like have something like a like a trophy in their hand. That was the

235
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:51,880
wrong thing. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait.

236
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:05,190
Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Hold on. Wait. Where am I? Okay. Zero hearts. Fucking loser.

237
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:28,820
A 1-0. Who is it for? The guy with zero or the guy with 48? Let's try Simon.

238
00:50:39,909 --> 00:50:43,829
I just looked over and saw the guy with the fucking like golf trophy about to kill me.

239
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:53,829
If I ever need to settle you guys down, I just have to press that button.

240
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:59,619
All right. We're in the hottest restaurant in town. Drinking some red wine.

241
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:10,949
Did you find that in your food? Did we complain? Wow. Holy shit. You just- that's like- that was

242
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:46,039
like her grandparents' locket. This is a hexagon minigame. Bang right there. Don't get greedy.

243
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:21,110
Wait. And go. It's not gonna hit it. Check this out. It's gonna bounce.

244
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:46,650
Too late. Got it. Oh. I'm winning by a lot. Hopefully we find the locket that's on the ground.

245
00:52:47,449 --> 00:53:17,449
That's it. Game over. I win. All that to climb under here. Did somebody pay for it? I don't know

246
00:53:17,449 --> 00:53:23,059
why but for some reason didn't- didn't- did anybody else want them like just to go up there and to go

247
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,599
like blow into each other's mouths? Am I the only one that like thought- saw that happening?

248
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:53,219
No? Are you sure? I won the whole thing. Where's the road?

249
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:08,969
There's no one that contested. They're all gone. Is it the guy that got zero points and that didn't

250
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:26,139
just blow into the girl's mouth? We're getting married. From a fucking game show. From a fucking

251
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:46,550
game show. Oh we didn't get one extra one. We didn't get an extra one. There's no extra one.

252
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:55,380
I'm Chris Harrison from everyone here at the Bachelorette. Good night. And that's a wrap.

253
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,590
All right get the fuck away from me. Oh you- you've smelled so bad this entire fucking game show.

254
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,730
Yeah whatever. The rose you had. Fucking- wasn't even real rose. Plastic? We're giving plastic roses?

255
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:18,360
So wait I- so I get- I got married. Okay love test. All right it's time. It's time to do- to do these.

256
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:26,309
Let's do it. Personality quiz. Let's act- I'm gonna answer this as truthfully as I can.

257
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:32,900
How do you make a first impression on a date? If I- okay if it was me and it was real.

258
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:45,579
And it's- it would never be A. Ever. It would be B. Like hey how are you? Hello. Just saying hello.

259
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:51,739
Well that's terrible. Does love at first sight really exist? Of course I have that effect on

260
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:58,219
other people. It's romantic but hard to take that seriously. No it's a cliche that only happens in

261
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:03,579
movies. Yes I believe it exists. It's romantic but you- I don't take that very seriously.

262
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:09,579
Your date shows up at the door. What's the first thing you look at? Their body, their eyes,

263
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:23,800
their shoes, their smile. Just like hey good good to see you. Oh yeah uh hey hey Carol.

264
00:56:30,539 --> 00:56:36,699
It's it's it's like it's it's like one of these. It's like there. How do you feel about blind dates?

265
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:46,340
How do I feel about blind dates? Why? I don't even need to answer this. Hey I know somebody

266
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:55,429
that you might like. Oh cool. What do they like? Fuck you. Just go on a date loser. Oh and you did

267
00:56:55,429 --> 00:57:05,829
this to the other person. So two people have been told hey I know somebody that's single. You should

268
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:14,250
you should you should go on a date with them tomorrow. Go and like go to like a nice place

269
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:18,489
so you're like you get nervous when you eat the food. We've already gone over this shit.

270
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:25,480
All right I can arrange my own dates thank you very much. A. They're fine as long as other people

271
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:31,079
as the other person is my type. But I like to know the person before going out with them. Okay

272
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:44,230
I think they're sweet. That's how my parents met. It's it's a it's a it's a I like um I'm

273
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:51,800
I feel like I'm like just getting set up on like a blind date. You don't even know who the fuck you

274
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,280
are or who you are or who you're talking to. It's almost like you get like dropped off at school by

275
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:12,630
mom. Like your first day of school. Okay have a fun time. Okay mom. Is it you? Jen? Jen? Jeremy?

276
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:27,500
Oh you? No not right person. Oh neck. What's wrong with my neck? How do you feel about blind

277
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:31,820
dates? I can arrange my own dates thank you very much. Where would you prefer to spend your date?

278
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,659
Would you rather be at a fancy restaurant? I like a bit of class. Coffee shop but like a good

279
00:58:35,659 --> 00:58:40,219
conversation. At the movies I like the familiarity. At the park I like holding hands.

280
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:49,480
It would probably it's coffee's easy. Coffee's the best. But movies actually is the correct answer

281
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:57,579
here. You go to the movie. There is a long archived conversation about what you do on a date

282
00:58:58,219 --> 00:59:01,420
from personal advice from germa985.

283
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:12,150
Conversation should you avoid most on the first date? What topic should you avoid the most? Your

284
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:22,780
ex? That's terrible. Politics? That's also terrible. First date? I need to know first of all before we

285
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:28,219
go in before we even see the appetizer menu. Are you a democrat or a republican?

286
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:34,860
Oh oh that was not the response I was looking for. Okay we don't have to talk about the politics.

287
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:43,449
Okay settle down. Do you want me to go? Okay I'll go. I'll go. How much you hate your job

288
00:59:49,829 --> 01:00:10,679
dating a car? There's a car in the restaurant where they sit at the table and you're across from the

289
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:20,179
car. All right don't talk about politics. Religion it's not terrible because you can just be like

290
01:00:20,179 --> 01:00:24,900
man like how did we really get here and people fucking talk like that all the time. Don't talk

291
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:30,739
about politics. You're coming to the end of a great first date and there's definitely some chemistry.

292
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:35,780
Do you move in for the kiss? Okay you're coming to the end of a great first date and there's

293
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,500
definitely some chemistry. Do you move in for the kiss? I can't. I never make the first move. I'd

294
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,340
want to but the other person has to feel it too. Not on the first date. It wouldn't be appropriate.

295
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:51,130
Both of us make the first move at the same time. How does that work? Is it like...

296
01:00:51,130 --> 01:02:51,610
Okay no wait wait wait hold on. I need to I gotta get this. I think I broke it. I think I'm breaking

297
01:02:51,610 --> 01:03:10,250
my stream. Holy shit this is so delayed. This is fucked up. I yeah I broke it. Oh it's because I

298
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:16,090
don't have two cameras right. Hold on. Yes I do. No I don't. Yes I do. Hold on. This is worth it.

299
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:24,300
Trust me. Go to the bathroom for a minute. It's because you can't do it with the same camera. I

300
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:50,710
gotta get my reference cam. It becomes a five minute joke. Maybe I can do it. Hold on. I think

301
01:03:50,710 --> 01:04:14,949
I can do it. Let's see. Shit. The other camera's not here. Damn it. It's not here and it's not

302
01:04:14,949 --> 01:04:39,079
possible to get. Fuck. You know what I was going to do. Shit. There's no other way I can do this.

303
01:04:39,639 --> 01:05:16,010
Is there no other way? There's no other way. Oh I'm sad. Damn it. Print out a picture.

304
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:23,289
Oh yeah I gotta have two cameras here. Oh it's disappointing when you can't capitalize on a

305
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:31,449
fucking potential plus two point of the stream. All right what. Oh none of the first date.

306
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:37,449
Both of us. We make them over the same time. Your date is 20 minutes late and there's still

307
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:42,170
no sign of them in the restaurant. You call but there's no answer. What do you do?

308
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:59,289
I'm gonna go home. I'll wait around for five more minutes but that's it. Call again. Maybe this time

309
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:04,329
it'll get through. I'm staying here. Something must have happened. I'm going home. You're out on a

310
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:10,420
first date but the two of you just don't click. It's getting late and you'd rather leave. You end

311
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:16,699
the date. That's really easy to make up a lie and leave. Tell them honestly thank them. Have a friend

312
01:06:16,699 --> 01:06:24,659
call them and bail me out. I just go through with the rest of the date. Yeah you know you just say

313
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:35,130
uh it's uh hello hello what is this oh no way oh you're in town you're in town for just the next

314
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:44,250

spirit happy and carefree you enjoy meeting new people and take everything in stride

320
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:40,329
you might be a bit cautious when it comes to love and you definitely believe in its power

321
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:48,260
wow we got more of these to do you're walking along the beach when you come across a dog with

got siblings that are way smarter than me in every single facet of life every single one

366
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:42,550
do you find yourself filled with a sense of joy and happiness during the holiday season

367
01:13:43,989 --> 01:13:48,869
not really am i supposed to yeah i think so must be all the gift-giving well lately it's become

368
01:13:48,869 --> 01:13:54,390
more hectic and busy absolutely my favorite time i think so i think i feel all right during the

369
01:13:54,390 --> 01:14:00,789
holidays those who fight constantly have forgotten how to express affection do you agree those who

370
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:05,829
fight constantly have forgotten how to express affection that's obvious who likes fighting i

371
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:09,750
would agree that being caring and affectionate takes practice not fighting doesn't necessarily

372
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,590
mean you don't have problems i don't completely agree but fighting certainly doesn't help

373
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:34,149
i mean it's probably i would say probably d for me i mean these all could be accurate c but not

374
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:39,939
fighting doesn't necessarily mean you don't have problems i don't know it's what are we talking

375
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:49,210
about like fighting like what does that mean that's obvious who likes fighting i mean it doesn't i

376
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:58,739
fist fight it's not what that that's incorrect not combat it's not combat now fighting doesn't

377
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:06,039
help but i don't know it's i don't know i don't know what they mean you're the teddy bear you are

378
01:15:06,039 --> 01:15:11,479
a walking hug always putting others before yourself your actions are genuine and ever selfish watch

379
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:19,340
out for those who might take advantage of your sweet side i wanted i thought i wanted to get

380
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:24,869
like the bull you know what i mean the teddy bear that's not accurate money matters after a dinner

381
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:26,310
pays the bill

382
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:43,189
oh look honey i'm worth it imagine saying that had like a first date or a second date imagine

383
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:51,590
how much of a fucking psycho you would have to be oh here comes the bill oh okay so uh look i'm

384
01:15:51,590 --> 01:16:05,899
worth it that would be like a instantly leaving the restaurant uh i initiated the date i'll pay

385
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:12,710
it is the money and the relationship somebody's got to do it but it won't be me times have changed

386
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:16,069
people need to be aware of their money situation the person who is more financially competent in

387
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:27,079
such matters if you're rich i don't see a problem why is everybody automatically saying this is d

388
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:51,000
for me this is me people have to be aware of their money situation you got to be aware

389
01:16:52,279 --> 01:16:56,359
are you okay with you if your partner makes more money than you okay with that more than okay that's

390
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:03,369
how i support my lifestyle uh it wouldn't feel that i was doing my equal share depends on how

391
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:07,210
much it depends by how much and if i was able to earn more if it doesn't affect my relationship

392
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:16,199
then i'm fine with it now if it doesn't affect the relationship though i don't care what do i care

393
01:17:18,069 --> 01:17:27,989
if money can't buy me love what can it buy uh education security freedom uh it's one of these

394
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:38,489
two education is fucking expensive yeah educate what is it what is it how how much does it cost

395
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:49,180
to go to school now like 489 000 but having a bunch of money to go to like to like not worry

396
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:58,149
about school um gives you security it's security it's been said a person's wealth is not always

397
01:17:58,149 --> 01:18:03,180
a reflection of what they have what does that mean it means don't be fooled by someone who

398
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:06,380
looks rich it means that happiness is not always linked to money it means you can make a lot of

399
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:14,579
money but still owe a lot it means they're not spending enough it means that happiness is not

400
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:18,659
always linked to money that's what the saying means after checking your bank account you

401
01:18:18,659 --> 01:18:23,380
discovered your spouse has been making a lot of expensive purchases lately how do you feel

402
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,699
no big deal people should live a little angry we need to talk about this are these purchases

403
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:41,979
made out of necessity that's the idea you're sharing a life together i mean this is probably

404
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:45,819
the like it would be like what it would be like what what did you buy like what is this

405
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:54,380
are we talking about like you bought there's a lot of different kinds of expensive purchases

406
01:18:54,939 --> 01:19:05,210
did you buy a expensive bracelet or a jumpy house because one of those things is a little

407
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:15,420
bit different than the other i mean i don't know i'd be like that way i'd be like why'd you buy a

408
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:27,079
jumpy house i'd be fucking really happy about it so that uh not a big deal you've met someone new

409
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:32,279
and everything is going well until you find out they're actually in heavy debt does this affect

410
01:19:32,279 --> 01:19:36,600
your relationship definitely how can i expect them to take care of me i'd continue seeing the

411
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,079
person but this is a warning sign difficult to see myself with such an irresponsible partner

412
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:55,699
everybody has debts nobody's perfect i have a heavy debt i mean it's it's either b or d

413
01:19:55,699 --> 01:20:01,159
but what does that happen like it's okay you met it you met someone new and everything is going

414
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:06,039
well until it's almost like they're scratching out until it's like until the rest of this is

415
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:10,840
scratched out they ask for you to pay for all their credit card bills and all the loans they have

416
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:20,619
it's like that what doesn't all of this i mean it's it's probably like d or like b

417
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,960
but if it's student debt everybody has fucking debt whatever how would you feel if your spouse
