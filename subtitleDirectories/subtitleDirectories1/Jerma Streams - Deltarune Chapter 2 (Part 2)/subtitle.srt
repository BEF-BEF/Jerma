1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,660
Damn, I lost track of time. I just did. That's a fact. There's no sound. Oh shit, hold on.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:17,190
There we go. Yeah, I lost track of time. I just kind of blinked, and it was like,

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:26,379
two. I was like, what the hell happened? Content creator. That's right. I don't have to say

4
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:37,990
anything. I'm a content creator. I don't have to say anything. I also want to ask you guys

5
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:44,570
something, because I don't know if this was a dream I had last night, or if this was a thing

6
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:53,380
I told you guys yesterday. I don't remember. I have to ask you. So at some point yesterday,

7
00:00:53,380 --> 00:01:00,740
it was either a dream last night or last night near the end of the stream. I was humming a song.

8
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:11,189
I was going like, I was doing like, you know, the thing that I do. I'm just humming a song with

9
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,329
like a high pitched sound, right? And I stopped halfway through and I said, I went like this,

10
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:24,170
I went like, I just freaked out. I said, I'm fucking Peter Griffin with a different noise.

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,890
That happened yesterday? Or did I dream that that happened yesterday? I had a dream that that

12
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:45,379
happened. That did not happen. I had, okay, so apparently I had a dream last night where I

13
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:52,230
was sitting here doing that. And I freaked out and I said, I'm Peter Griffin with a different noise.

14
00:01:52,230 --> 00:02:07,340
What the fuck? And there was way more shit that happened in that dream too. Was it during Bone?

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,620
Was it during Boneworks? Wait, did that happen during, that happened on another stream?

16
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:24,650
Did that happen on a different fucking broadcast? No, it didn't. It did. Okay, well, it happened.

17
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:33,639
Hey, thank you a little bit later for the damn guy Peter to yourself. You've done that 40 times.

18
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,080
Is that, what else? I must be so scared of being connected to like family guy that I have

19
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:47,930
nightmares about it now. Remember, were you tripping? No, I've refused to trip. I'm never

20
00:02:47,930 --> 00:03:01,560
going to do it. It'll never happen. I don't, I can't, I don't want to do that stuff. Nightmare.

21
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,400
Anyways, let's talk about today because we're going to, we're doing a little schedule pivot

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,949
change today. Pivot change. We're going to finish Undertale. But you know what I mean.

23
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:25,080
We're going to finish Deltarune. And then after that, we are not going to play Umbrellas

24
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:33,990
not allowed anymore. We're going to move from here to the tip of the hat stream. So we will

25
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,069
raid the tip of the hat stream and I'm going to go over there and participate for like an hour or so.

26
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,340
I play a game or something. I just hang out. So we're going to go from here to tip of the hats

27
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:58,229
later. This is Deltarune. Yes, this is not Undertale. I need to tweet this. So let's go

28
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:32,810
ahead and tweet Andy. Be right back. While I write this, somebody said, are you going to stream the

29
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:38,699
Diablo 2 remake? The answer is no. And I'll give you a very specific couple of reasons why.

30
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:48,300
If I ever really sit down and play the Diablo 2 remake on stream, I feel like, and I'm this,

31
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,100
this is not, this is nothing against you guys. This is nothing against streaming or YouTube.

32
00:04:54,579 --> 00:05:03,720
That's a me thing. I don't, I don't really want to stream that. It's a me thing. If I'm going to do

33
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,920
that because I don't really want to turn it into like a thing that I'm streaming and just kind of

34
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,879
turn it on. Cause I wanted to be able to sit, sit in this chair with my mouth open, just staring

35
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,399
and just not even say a word and just fucking just walk around and pick up uniques and stuff.

36
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,750
Oh, it is nothing against this community, the stream, nothing. I just, I'm not going to stream

37
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:36,699
that if I'm going to play it. Diablo 2 is great, but Diablo 2 is also a lot of just kind of,

38
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,180
Oh my God, we got, we, we got, we got 15 community subs from no seven. Thank you.

39
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,120
Once you get through the first few acts of Diablo 2 and you, you know, if you beat the game,

40
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,079
you go through a nightmare, you beat the game, you go through it. It's a lot of just like,

41
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,800
I let's get the cube. Okay. Get the amulet. You get the way point. Yep. Okay. Go, go. All right.

42
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,199
Nice. Like, hold on. I gotta put a point in. All right. Put the make cube. Let's go. Dario go.

43
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,339
All right. Act three, you get the way point. Yep. It's, it's literally just kind of, you just go

44
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,399
through the motions like 10 times to get like a pretty colored item. That's what we want.

45
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:24,170
It's a good just chatting game. Yeah. Okay. Oh, here, here. Listen, if I ever get to a point

46
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,689
where I have like a level, like 70 sorceress or something, if I'm like playing the fuck out

47
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,610
of that game and I want to just do like a stream where I'm just sitting here doing like Mephisto

48
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,769
runs while we just talk and yeah, you'll see it, but I'm not going to start like a level

49
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:45,319
zero barbarian in the remake and stream that, right? That's the thing I'd want to do on my own.

50
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,970
Oh, here comes, here comes the chimpanzees. All right. Let me finish my tweet. You guys are

51
00:06:52,970 --> 00:07:05,319
distracting me. That's why I was so late today. You should play Deltarune chapter two. I agree.

52
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:30,970
So let's get started. Let me just tweet this. Anybody else only type with their dominant hands

53
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:39,319
thumb on their phone's keyboard? I hold. So I'm right-handed. So I hold the phone in my left hand

54
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,819
with my thumb up. And so I'm like holding it, um, kind of like palming it in a way. My, all my

55
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,740
fingers are kind of around the edges of the other side. And then I cup the first hand that my left

56
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,620
hand is holding it with the right hand. And then I use the sole right thumb to type everything.

57
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:06,360
That weird to use both thumbs. I don't do that. That's not a boomer hold. Excuse me. The boomer

58
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,959
hold is hold with left-hand palm index finger on other dominant hand is poking while it's very

59
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:19,959
close to your face. Excuse me. I'm not going to be put in that category. I'm a millennial.

60
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:37,500
Did I even press the tweet button? All right. I'm ready. You guys ready? Here we go. This is

61
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:52,950
what we left off. Turn it up. It's way faster to use both hands. Yeah, but I, okay. Here's my problem

62
00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:00,309
with that. The keyboard is so tiny that if I use both hands and fingers or whatever, I press like

63
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:19,190
eight different letters. Loud. Not too loud. All right. Here we go. So the last thing that happened

64
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:28,649
was a sand showed up and threw fucking lightning bolts out of the sky. And if we had to like dodge

65
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,779
them and shit, it was crazy. And one of them hits, uh, one of them hits Susie and Susie's now currently,

66
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,919
um, like dying, I think in the other room, which is like crazy. I hit Susie. It hit me and it hit,

67
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:54,629
um, it was, that's the last thing to happen is from crazy. I'm going to head out. Uh, what it's

68
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:01,539
too loud. No, it's not. This is softer than it was yesterday. Please apologize for timing me up for

69
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,580
10 minutes. All right. So the pre-stream chat, I timed somebody over 10 minutes, but hold on. Yes.

70
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,500
I apologize for timing you out for 10 minutes in pre-stream, but let's talk about the context first.

71
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:17,220
You asked me to play destiny to PVP tomorrow. Do you think that is, is that a, should I have

72
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:26,919
timed you up for an hour or is that, was 10 minutes, um, warranted? I'm sorry for time. I didn't,

73
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:31,379
I was trying to do it for like a minute. I'm sorry. That's a permanent man. All right. I'm ready.

74
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:41,980
Let's go. I'm ready to play. I keep almost saying undertale. So quick recap. Um, Lancer is sick.

75
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,980
He's ill. He saved us. He was in our pocket for like a day or two. He came out. He let us all out.

76
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,779
We were captured by the queen and now he's kind of sick. He's like cold and he can't walk and stuff.

77
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,950
So this is kind of, this is, um, it's getting a little weird. All right. Think you can do it,

78
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,860
Chris? Of course I can. I can do puzzles. Calm your skinless boneless thighs. Everybody.

79
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,679
I'll think of a solution. I gotta get my voices going. I gotta get my voices going.

80
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:18,330
It's just ignore him. I'll just be over here where I can't hear you and I'll be here away

81
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,259
from your IQ debuffing aura. There we go. That's better. All right. So we're,

82
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:41,299
move. Oh, I see. It's one of these puzzles. Oh, I can rotate it. We go. We go. We go.

83
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:59,990
We go. We go. Is that supposed to do that? Yeah, we got it. What? Hey, wait a second. How did you,

84
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:11,019
how'd you solve it without me? First figured it out before you jealous. Well, I knew the answer.

85
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:18,039
I just wanted to see Chris try first. By the way, if anyone can tell me what that, what that laugh

86
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:32,580
was, you get 10, uh, community thumbs up points. What was that? It was not Gannon. Nope. Laugh.

87
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:41,340
Nope. Nope. Not Zelda. Wrong. Somebody got to say it. Did somebody say it? I think I saw it.

88
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,970
I want to be confirmed that more than one person knew what it was. Not Street Fighter,

89
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:56,169
not punch out. Do it again. Hup, hup, hup, hup. Hup, hup, hup, hup. I'll tell you, it's from, uh,

90
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,950
it's from a group of turtles. I just, it's a Ninja turtle there. I fucking just ruined it.

91
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,639
That's Shredder from Turtles in Time when he jumps into the screen and he like,

92
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:16,460
puts you back in time. Oh, you got it wrong. Sorry. Uh, it's called Suspense Susan. Dramatic

93
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:27,429
suspense. Nobody cares. I do. That's bullshit. Go watch, go look at it then. If I'm so wrong then.

94
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:44,100
And you do the next one. Fine. Watch me. Also, my name's not Susan. Oh shit, these are going to get

95
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:51,419
harder. Child's play. Wouldn't you give me a harder one? For example, if anyone had a four by four

96
00:13:51,419 --> 00:14:05,299
puzzle to you. Just tell us the solution. Well, you see, first you align the shadows with the

97
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:14,730
lines on the floor. All right, what do we move first? Um, let's just do the puzzle. Just give

98
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:22,580
me a moment. It's not like Chris could even solve it anyway. Oh, this is actually, this might take

99
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:41,340
a little while. Well, maybe not. Let's see how smart I am. Turns out I know what I'm doing.

100
00:14:41,340 --> 00:15:00,179
Okay, I just want to go pick this up off the ground. Oh, no, I don't. Oops. Everybody,

101
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:13,240
everybody thinks they're so smart until they're not. Right. Oh shit. This is going to, I don't,

102
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:25,850
I need to, I feel like I had it. Correct. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

103
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:35,509
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, it doesn't go

104
00:15:35,509 --> 00:16:03,320
flat. Oh my God. No, stop, stop. Everyone quiet. No, wrong one. Idiot. Fuck. This doesn't, no,

105
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:27,799
none of them go flat. Shit. I don't know. I thought I had it. How do I do this? Wait, fuck.

106
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:41,779
Are you trolling? No, I'm not. It's just weird. Did I have it right the first time? I'm actually

107
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:54,250
blown away by this time. Everybody else says I'm bad. Oh my God. I'm absolutely blown away by this.

108
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:12,440
I can't believe I'm blown away. So like, this is making me like so mad. I got it. What the fuck?

109
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:43,319
Shit. Hey. Dude, I'm fucking blown away by this. It is funny when he cannot solve the puzzle. Omega

110
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:49,589
lull. Is this the future of like Twitch chat? It's going to be like androids. It is quite

111
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:59,109
humorous when he cannot solve the children's puzzle. You can't have. You just got lucky.

112
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:09,019
It's just trial and error. Kind of was for me. It was for me. I just looked up shredder laughing

113
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:16,779
and it sounds nothing like that. All right. Well, it's time for me to fucking. All right,

114
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:28,339
fine. I can't believe I actually have to do this. I can't fucking believe I have to do this.

115
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:52,250
So here it is. Let me just go like this. Not there. Where is it? It's when he comes out of the screen.

116
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,849
This is not a joke alert. This is literally I'm waiting for him to do the ha ha ha thing.

117
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,809
There it is. So you beat shredder, throw a bunch of people into his screen.

118
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:10,730
And what did that what happened?

119
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:39,460
And I was, I was the wrong one apparently. Remember that guy is.

120
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:49,740
Let's go. Brute force method. Arcade man could do it. Except cavemen died out because they're

121
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:58,980
stupid. I'm solving the next one. So just stay here until I'm done. Yeah, like we're going to

122
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:08,650
wait that long. Am I at the end of the game? Um, I believe I am fairly close to being at the last

123
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:15,369
portion of the game. What are you two doing here? This one's mine. It'll be over in a second. So why

124
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:23,289
don't you just relax in your mind palace? Which probably doesn't even have anything in it. I just

125
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:34,680
need to figure out why the shapes don't go together. Oh, hey, you just got to fill the whole square

126
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:42,700
thing, right? What if you just piled them all in the corners? Like digging a really wide hole.

127
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:54,299
What? First want to try? Oh, what? Oh, no. I don't like this. In the corner? Put them all in the

128
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,019
corner? I don't know. This is not gonna fit though. What do you mean put them in the corner?

129
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:40,869
Just like, stop them in the corner? Can I do that? Does that work? What? Dude, different corners.

130
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,559
What are you talking about? They have to go in different corners? I thought it was just like,

131
00:21:49,559 --> 00:22:07,960
just put them in there. Who cares? Isn't that correct? Well, I thought it was just to stick

132
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,180
everything in the corner. I thought that's what it was. That's not, he's actually zonked. I'm not.

133
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:23,529
I'm fine. I just woke up like 15 minutes ago. I'm fine. Okay. I did not. I woke up at like,

134
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:27,690
I woke up well into the morning, I promise. I didn't just wake up.

135
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,259
All right, Susie. I did the work. There's no way. It's a computer bug. It's a glitch.

136
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,019
You're cheating. Just like when you wave dashed.

137
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:52,500
How is it taste, idiot? Man, I'm gonna relish this forever. All those times you acted so high and

138
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:00,099
mighty. Oh, guess what? You're not. Face it. You're just a big dumbass. Just like the rest of us.

139
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:17,849
Oh, we're kind of sad. Fine. I admit it. I'm not that smart. I never was.

140
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,700
There. Are you happy? I just used to be a forgettable little blue bird.

141
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:33,420
No one even remembered my name. Then one day came the spelling bee Noel and I studied for.

142
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:39,880
And it came down to the two of us. She got nervous and couldn't speak.

143
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:57,130
We lost. And I won. That was when I tasted it. Praise the glory, the superiority, the addictive

144
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:04,549
power of being smart. Since then, year after year, I've been number one in the class. It was only

145
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:12,630
because Noel helped me study. He's the real smart kid. Everyone's expectations for me are so high

146
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:23,740
now. What am I going to do once I go somewhere without her? Why I wanted to make a new world

147
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:34,089
for us. A world where we'll always be number one and number two. But I'm still wrapped up in that.

148
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:41,849
I got tricked by the queen. Now Noel is going to suffer because of it. Maybe I did just like

149
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:52,940
being superior. Maybe I am just an idiot. Don't cry, chicken nugget man. All of us are idiots too.

150
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,500
Huh? I mean, like, I don't know about everyone else, but whether you're the smart kid or not,

151
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:07,099
we couldn't care less. Screw up as much as you want, honestly. Not like our opinion of you could.

152
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:11,130
Susie! Susie, you'd accept me even if I'm dumb?

153
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:17,750
Uh, yeah. Like when your sister gets cursed in Dragon Blazers 2.

154
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:30,259
Even if her stats suck, she's still your party member. Susie, real Dragon Blazers 2 reference?

155
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:38,730
Susie, you're not only kind, but a true gamer as well. Perhaps I underestimated you.

156
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:40,549
Uh, uh, uh.

157
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,289
Worry not. I have decided. Uh, uh, uh.

158
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:46,329
I will turn over a new leaf from now on. Uh, uh, uh.

159
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:49,289
And fight for the side of ignorance.

160
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,990
We're not telling you to be stupid. Yes, sometimes it's okay to make mistakes.

161
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,339
And make mistakes I will. Uh.

162
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:00,839
Onward!

163
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,289
Why couldn't Rousey be here to teach the normal lesson? He's a gamer.

164
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:28,660
This downstairs table will be for our special guests.

165
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,980
There's a dinner party on the second floor for everyone else.

166
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Everything here is tailored for you, right?

167
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,250
That's screaming. That's Rousey.

168
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,539
Um, you don't have to scream.

169
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,619
Just because you like my outfit.

170
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:56,500
Oh my god.

171
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,190
I need to take a- I need to take at least a minute for that one.

172
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,710
Okay.

173
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,670
Oh, Chris. Susie. Uh, how may I serve you?

174
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:17,750
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,390
Um, the queen didn't have a room for me so, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh.

176
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,390
She made me into one of her butlers instead.

177
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,759
Whatever, Rousey. Can you heal Lancer?

178
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,369
Come on. Give me that one.

179
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,059
Oh. It's cold.

180
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,230
Susie.

181
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,759
I'm afraid this is something I can't heal.

182
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,700
What?

183
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,440
Lancer is-

184
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,269
Lancer? Hey!

185
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,349
You see, each dark fountain creates a different world.

186
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,150
A world whose darkness reflect the will of its fountain.

187
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,549
Can I do that one again?

188
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:09,430
Can we do that one again?

189
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:10,789
I messed it up.

190
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:17,210
A world whose darkners reflect the will of its fountain.

191
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:21,849
But through those darkners can exist in their own worlds.

192
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,299
They might not belong if they go to another one.

193
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,720
So can we help him?

194
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,730
Yes, there is a way.

195
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,170
Castletown's Grand Fountain is made of pure darkness.

196
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,769
As long as it stays flowing, any darkner can live there.

197
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:53,220
So if we bring Lancer back to school, he'll be okay again.

198
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,190
He thinks he's a voice actor.

199
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,670
So we just need to get out of here, huh?

200
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,170
Right.

201
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:08,089
Alright.

202
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,470
Lancer, we'll be back for you, buddy.

203
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,240
We can't jump between dark worlds.

204
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:19,400
Your friend, if we defeat Queen, we can save him.

205
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,539
Yeah, with me out of the way, Queen is going to force Noelle to do her bidding.

206
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:33,539
And if Noelle doesn't want to, she might make her face into a robot one.

207
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:39,210
Seriously.

208
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,710
Would you assist me in saving Noelle?

209
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:50,329
Me? I just can't do it by myself.

210
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,660
But if you can help me, I have a plan.

211
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:55,519
A plan?

212
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,140
I remember from Queen's tour of this place.

213
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,779
It's a secret shortcut on the third floor.

214
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:06,549
While Chris is distracting Queen, Susie will take the shortcut to reach Noelle

215
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,539
and transfer her to me on the roof.

216
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,619
From there, I'll bring her to a safe hiding spot.

217
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,500
And together we can all defeat the Queen!

218
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:20,730
Alright, sure, we'll give it a shot.

219
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,750
Most excellent said.

220
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:28,019
See you on the roof, fellow agent.

221
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:33,779
Alright, let's go.

222
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,390
Did you take that off already?

223
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,170
Sorry.

224
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,619
That's like sad.

225
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,569
We're just gonna leave him here?

226
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:47,789
Whoa.

227
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,150
Whoa, wait.

228
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,759
Is this like an Easter egg?

229
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,720
What if I move him all the way?

230
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,160
What?

231
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,660
He seems to be well taken care of.

232
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,420
Is this spaghetti?

233
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,789
Is that spaghetti?

234
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,220
Oh shit, this is just...

235
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,720
Okay.

236
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,410
Wait, what?

237
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,470
We're gonna have these legs?

238
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,819
It's a pair of legs.

239
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,809
I think that's like bathrooms on fire.

240
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,210
It's a door.

241
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,250
Where will you go?

242
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:54,680
Oh, fuck.

243
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,579
Okay, hold on.

244
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,019
It's a cyber thing.

245
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:03,940
There's a book here about shortcuts that open up later.

246
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,970
The Cybernetic Bookshelf.

247
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,789
Welcome to Collar Cafe.

248
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:15,829
Let us warm your day.

249
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:18,579
Talk about yourself.

250
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:22,470
Ah, forgive me for not introducing myself sooner, young masters.

251
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,670
I am Swatch, our Lady Grace's head butler.

252
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,410
When we are not attending to her needs,

253
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,690
I and the Queen's other style,

254
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:33,529
use this room as our humble yet colorful gift shop slash cafe.

255
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,410
Please shop to your heart's content.

256
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,170
We are eager to serve your any dish.

257
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,549
Does a woman of Our Lady Grace's caliber not deserve

258
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:47,750
a coven of powerful men and women to dote upon her every movement?

259
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,480
Have rap anthems written to her kindness?

260
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,890
Which are then bit crushed beyond recognition to make them more computer?

261
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,660
To have melons smashed with karate chops repeatedly for no apparent reason?

262
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,220
To have barrels thrown from the rafters?

263
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,000
Make us smash them all with karate chops before the timer runs out?

264
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,890
The barrels are full of melons and we have to smash those too?

265
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,940
Yes, the answer is yes.

266
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:24,819
Rooksholtz, I'm afraid I am not familiar with a guest of that moniker.

267
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,779
Ah wait, are you by chance referring to that unbearable,

268
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,019
unique man who barged in here and demanded to be made butler supremeth?

269
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,460
I'm afraid that that person is now banned from this establishment.

270
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,529
May have suffered injuries as a result of his,

271
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,769
uh, rather swift ejection.

272
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,849
Please do not mention him again.

273
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:47,339
You're still cleaning up the worms he left on the floor.

274
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,950
Outfit.

275
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,500
Ah, my outfit.

276
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Yes, the monochrome look is quite suitable, isn't it?

277
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,009
Black suit, colored glasses.

278
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,250
Many people have failed to imitate this look.

279
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,140
So I'm even going so far as to attempt to impersonate me.

280
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,349
I'm going to get the, uh, nevermind.

281
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:06,069
Back around?

282
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:10,309
It's rules.

283
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:11,429
No, it's Rooksholtz!

284
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:16,380
It's Roxas!

285
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:16,880
Yes.

286
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,780
It's the Peter Griffin thing again.

287
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:33,980
I'm out.

288
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,699
Butt juice.

289
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,619
Oh god.

290
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:43,210
Uh, 100 HP for butt juice.

291
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,250
What about the spaghetti code?

292
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,309
You're insane.

293
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,349
Not.

294
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,550
30 HP?

295
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,829
Why is this $180?

296
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:00,940
B-shot bow tie.

297
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,440
Ooh.

298
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:03,980
Royal pin.

299
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,480
Ooh.

300
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,030
Oh, it's a everybody heel.

301
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,750
Okay.

302
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,829
It's a party heel.

303
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:13,340
Oh, it is, it says party.

304
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:18,860
I'm going to get a bow tie?

305
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,980
Or should I get the royal pin?

306
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,519
All right, I'm getting the royal pin.

307
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,719
It's probably, is this expensive?

308
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:26,949
That's two armor.

309
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,010
I'm going to hold on to it.

310
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,929
Can I sell, sell weapons?

311
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:36,329
No.

312
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:36,889
Sell armor?

313
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,289
Oh wait, I can sell the stupid mannequin.

314
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,099
Should I keep the mannequin for like crafting or something?

315
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,940
Should I never sell anything?

316
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:47,679
Whoa.

317
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,769
Dog dollar.

318
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:54,539
Should I sell the dog dollar?

319
00:35:54,539 --> 00:36:00,809
Oh, hold.

320
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:03,739
All right, that's, that's enough.

321
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Hold.

322
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:16,440
Okay, I want to go visit, yeah.

323
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,559
I want to go visit the trash guy.

324
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,300
Trash zone.

325
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,260
It's an eggplant that looks like a trash bag.

326
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,880
Funny little guy was looking for you to the west.

327
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:34,860
He was muttering something about deals.

328
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,420
I know what that way is.

329
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:52,869
Door is unlocked.

330
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:57,900
I'm going in.

331
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:01,210
What, you want to go in by yourself?

332
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,130
Whatever, do what you want.

333
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,820
Hey, hey, hey.

334
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,860
It's me, Spamton G.

335
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,000
Spamton.

336
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:14,019
Let's make a deal.

337
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,860
Okay, about you.

338
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,900
I used to be not a robot email guy.

339
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,739
And now I'm the, ow.

340
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,099
It burns, help me, ow.

341
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,139
I'm the, it burns guy.

342
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,250
Amazed at this amazing transformation,

343
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,929
you too can have a communion.

344
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:32,010
Where, with, ha ha.

345
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,480
Soon I'll even surpass that damned clown.

346
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,079
Clown around town, a clown in the town.

347
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,119
But unlike him, I'm going to shoot for the sky.

348
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,840
Get down the path, you, the big one.

349
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:46,179
I'll get so, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get so,

350
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,699
I'll get, I'll get, ow.

351
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:54,150
Speaking of communion.

352
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,099
Chris, did you know that there's a knight?

353
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,539
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

354
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,260
I didn't mean to.

355
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:01,820
Too many excess vacation days

356
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,900
take a goddamn vacation straight to hell.

357
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,400
Friends?

358
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:11,690
Me?

359
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:13,469
Friends?

360
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,889
Chris, you and me,

361
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,650
our already friend request has been accepted.

362
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,809
We don't need anyone else.

363
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,530
We don't need easels or CRTs.

364
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,289
We don't need any man, woman, or child at half price.

365
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:29,130
We don't need Mike.

366
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,630
Mike.

367
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,909
Chris!

368
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,349
Don't believe anything you see on TV.

369
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,550
The man's a criminal, I tell you.

370
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,050
A criminal.

371
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:47,380
Do it again?

372
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:55,320
Okay, what about our deal?

373
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,190
Chris, you little sponge.

374
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,030
I knew you'd come here on a Saturday night.

375
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,349
After all, you want to be a big shot.

376
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:06,969
But how?

377
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:07,769
How can you be?

378
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,170
Listen, listen, listen to me.

379
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,769
Get in, get over here.

380
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,769
In the deep abyss of Queen's Mansion.

381
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,650
A great deal is waiting for a limited time.

382
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,010
No, well, only a limited time.

383
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,610
Only a heaven-piercing, work-out-ready body.

384
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:21,690
Signed by the classics.

385
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,929
You've come to expect our latest of 1997 copyright.

386
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:24,809
We gotta make sure we put that there.

387
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:28,010
Chris, that little nipper is

388
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,889
our one-way ticket to make you big.

389
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:31,849
Make it me big.

390
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:33,829
Before you know it,

391
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,349
we will be taking a ride around town

392
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:37,590
in our special conga-dero.

393
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,360
Vacationing in burning acid

394
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,480
while you soak in the hybrid.

395
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,539
But Chris, don't breathe yet.

396
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,619
The way is locked by high-quality encryption.

397
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,079
You will never get inside.

398
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,519
Wait, Chris, look.

399
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,400
Here, those balloons.

400
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,559
Are you the 1000th customer?

401
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,719
As a commemorative ring,

402
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,480
I will let you buy key-gen from me

403
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,360
at the low, low price.

404
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,599
What do you think?

405
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,639
It's such a steal.

406
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:06,840
I'm, I'm, I'm myself.

407
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm shitting myself.

408
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,360
Take this deal and you will die.

409
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,000
It's that good.

410
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,380
Buy the key-gen from me.

411
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,300
Unlock the basement and get that empty disc.

412
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,650
Okay, fear.

413
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,650
What are you afraid of?

414
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,210
According to encyclopedia of

415
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:28,090
being afraid.

416
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:30,730
There's nothing to fear except

417
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:36,280
can anyone hear me?

418
00:40:37,659 --> 00:40:40,360
Help, help.

419
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,920
Huh, what?

420
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,440
No, I didn't hear anything just now.

421
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,519
But it sounded kind of

422
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,400
like they were talking to you.

423
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,250
Buy key-gen from me

424
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,090
and go to Queen's mansion.

425
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,989
How do I get the key-gen?

426
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:01,030
What?

427
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,150
Go by myself, Chris.

428
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,190
No, the men inside,

429
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,789
the men inside would.

430
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:08,309
How do I buy it?

431
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:13,719
He just said buy.

432
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,289
Exit and buy more.

433
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,380
Oh, fuck.

434
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,500
I've been talking to him the whole time.

435
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,019
Okay.

436
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:32,980
Buy.

437
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,780
Hurry up and buy.

438
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,400
For a second I thought that was the menu.

439
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:37,880
Okay.

440
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,360
Buy.

441
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,840
Buy more.

442
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:42,760
What the fuck?

443
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:47,539
Key-gen S potion.

444
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,750
The big one.

445
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,750
B-shot bow tie or run away.

446
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,940
This is supposed to be like a market.

447
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,699
I have to catch this when it's 30 bucks.

448
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,969
Oh my god.

449
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:14,409
Oh, for seven bucks.

450
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:20,099
All right, what about this one?

451
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:22,099
Item, item affects HP a lot.

452
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:23,139
Okay, can I get this one too?

453
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,980
80.

454
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,019
All right, that's fine.

455
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:28,820
What about the...

456
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,099
What the fuck?

457
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,619
The big one.

458
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,300
Cut anything in two pieces.

459
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,699
Criminal.

460
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:45,719
Oh, wait.

461
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:48,570
I don't have to actually accept it.

462
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,929
Oh, well, okay.

463
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:51,050
I thought it was like you had to click it

464
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,929
and it just bought it.

465
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:58,840
Take it.

466
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:01,880
Can I buy these?

467
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:10,820
Can I buy...

468
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,940
Okay, I got two.

469
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,179
Should I get more of these potions?

470
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:19,960
Stop, stop.

471
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,000
Scam, scam, scam, scam.

472
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

473
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,280
Stop getting scammed.

474
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,760
What are you talking about?

475
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,639
All right, run away.

476
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,539
Buy.

477
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:29,909
You're buying weapons.

478
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:30,409
Oh.

479
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,280
Get more potions.

480
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,000
Should I?

481
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,659
Okay.

482
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,059
Talking.

483
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,260
Friends.

484
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,230
Yeah, well, I think we're good.

485
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,480
Buy more.

486
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:56,860
Okay, let's go.

487
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:04,809
Exit and buy more and then escape.

488
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:08,699
Mansion, basement.

489
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,400
Find it.

490
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:14,760
Creepy stuff were you buying anyway.

491
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,519
Ah, like I even want to know.

492
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:17,019
Yikes.

493
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:20,429
She said she hoped if it was candy,

494
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,230
you'd share with her.

495
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:22,769
Shut up.

496
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:26,400
Chris, what was it?

497
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,960
Raid bow tie.

498
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,920
Oh, it just goes down.

499
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:40,829
Oh, what the fuck.

500
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:41,329
Poison.

501
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,500
Oops.

502
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,460
Well, I have the key, right?

503
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,219
So I can go to the basement and the mansion.

504
00:44:50,860 --> 00:45:02,280
Funny little guy was looking for you.

505
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,780
Yep.

506
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,949
Okay, so let's go back to the mansion.

507
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,110
I wonder if I can go in another door now.

508
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:22,090
All right, I'm just going to sell this junk.

509
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:22,809
Maybe I shouldn't.

510
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:23,369
I might need it.

511
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:31,960
All right, I need the basement of the mansion.

512
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,659
Let's go this way.

513
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,199
I see you have escaped from your room unit.

514
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,610
Who can blame you for wanting to see my glorious mansion?

515
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,809
You won't want to take your eyes off this beautiful art.

516
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,820
We're not here to look at your stupid pictures.

517
00:45:58,539 --> 00:45:59,900
That was not a recommendation.

518
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,300
I was just warning you.

519
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,340
Laughing my ass off.

520
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:07,150
Oh, fuck.

521
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:09,130
Oh, my goodness.

522
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:16,699
Go down first.

523
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:22,510
What's that?

524
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:23,840
What's that?

525
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:24,960
Basement.

526
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,119
Wait, did that do anything?

527
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,289
Oh, shit.

528
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,530
Ooh, found a revivement.

529
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,760
Hey, I thought it was going to be lower than that.

530
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,480
Okay, and the notes.

531
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:05,980
All right, let's go.

532
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:12,559
Oh, I know you are all loving my mansion.

533
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,360
We have a few rules around here you have to follow.

534
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,360
One, wipe your shoes.

535
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,559
Two, have fun.

536
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:19,920
Three, respect the pottery.

537
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:21,519
Four, have fun.

538
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,480
Five, missed entry duplication error.

539
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,920
I was trying to talk.

540
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,039
I was trying to hang out with it.

541
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:32,530
What the fuck?

542
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,170
Okay, so what we got?

543
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,750
Warmify, coldify.

544
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:46,139
Bluer two stages.

545
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,260
Redder two stages.

546
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,460
Coldify the red.

547
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,820
And then we're going to see what this does.

548
00:47:58,639 --> 00:47:59,280
Half cold.

549
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,320
All right, we're going to see what this does.

550
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:01,880
What does this do?

551
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,559
Talked about the crunch of the last pickle in the refrigerator.

552
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,360
Okay, so now it's watching the color turn a lot colder.

553
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:09,920
It's now yellow.

554
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,039
All right, so now they both match.

555
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:17,760
Oh, there's candy in that one.

556
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,480
Oh, god damn it.

557
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:18,960
I want the candy.

558
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:32,920
Oh, super frog.

559
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:35,000
Pottery not respected.

560
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,679
I mean, I was trying to just see what it was.

561
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,800
See what it was.

562
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,159
All right, so just don't break the pottery.

563
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,519
But I kind of want to break the pottery.

564
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,860
Oh, because I want to recruit those guys.

565
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:51,420
Oh, they're just here anyways.

566
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:51,920
Okay.

567
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:59,599
All right, we need to warmify blue.

568
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,719
And we need to...

569
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,349
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

570
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:07,550
We need to coldify you.

571
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,949
We need to half warm you.

572
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,730
And then we're going to defend with you.

573
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:15,289
No, they don't have to be...

574
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,489
Well, yeah, they have to be yellow.

575
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,130
Yeah, I got it right.

576
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:22,619
They have to be yellow, right?

577
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:34,539
What are you doing?

578
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,019
Oh, they just have to be the same color.

579
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:37,980
They don't have to all be yellow?

580
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,869
Oh, I thought it was like blue was going to be tired.

581
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,150
Yellow was spare.

582
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,829
Oh, they just have to be the same color.

583
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:48,090
Okay, I thought it was like they had to be yellow.

584
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,849
It's like that's how you spare.

585
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:50,250
I don't know.

586
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:50,730
I don't know.

587
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,849
That's a Toby Fox game.

588
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:52,570
Could be anything.

589
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:57,949
All right, let's go.

590
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:01,179
So now I have to do warmify.

591
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:02,300
Well, let's just make them all yellow.

592
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,519
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

593
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:13,150
Coldify you, warmify you, and then you spare you.

594
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:13,710
This will do it.

595
00:50:16,269 --> 00:50:16,590
Hello.

596
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:21,599
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

597
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,199
That was a voice crack, but I saved it.

598
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:29,389
Andy.

599
00:50:29,389 --> 00:50:30,110
Got it.

600
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:37,530
All right, now we just spare.

601
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:43,440
Four to five.

602
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:43,760
Nice.

603
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,309
$328.

604
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:57,119
And check every window.

605
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:03,500
Andy, Andy.

606
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:06,559
Is this supposed to be a race?

607
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:13,150
One, two, three, four.

608
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,429
Okay, one.

609
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:15,869
Painting is labeled task.

610
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,280
Painting is labeled Timberley.

611
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,130
Painting is labeled task.

612
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,960
Painting is labeled task.

613
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,059
I don't get it.

614
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:44,760
Is this person's name Timberley?

615
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:46,800
Timberley.

616
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,480
All right, am I going to remember this?

617
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,280
Task spelled correctly.

618
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,820
Task, Timberley, task with a Q.

619
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,179
Task, Timberley, task.

620
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:05,440
TASK.

621
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,400
Task, Timberley, task, TASK.

622
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,719
Got it.

623
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:14,190
Just in time for your appointment.

624
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,030
Would you assist in organizing these paintings?

625
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:17,230
Yes.

626
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,210
I'll refine.

627
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:20,889
Then the first question.

628
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,880
Which painting's name is first alphabetically?

629
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:27,800
Task.

630
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,360
Okay.

631
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:35,130
Ask, T-A, T-A-S, T-A-S-K.

632
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,679
Timberley is T-I.

633
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,389
There's I.

634
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:41,630
So K is above that.

635
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:41,869
Q.

636
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,030
All right, the four.

637
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,869
Wait, number four.

638
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:46,670
How do I say four?

639
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:49,500
Number four was tasked with a Q.

640
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,099
The left painting is four.

641
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:53,019
Why is it not, it's four.

642
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,309
I'll refine.

643
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:56,670
And the next question.

644
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,469
Which painting's name is third alphabetically?

645
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay, that would be, so,

646
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,039
K, tasked with a K,

647
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:06,880
tasked with a Q,

648
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,840
tasked with a C was that one.

649
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:12,920
Wait, what was the question?

650
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,119
Because that would be Timberley and then task.

651
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:16,760
Okay, bottom.

652
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,380
I'll refine.

653
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,739
Then the next question.

654
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:20,860
Which painting is fourth?

655
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:27,449
Task, Timberley, task, TASK.

656
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:33,340
That's correct.

657
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,940
I'm so happy I could whip something.

658
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:39,659
Task manager blocks the way.

659
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,820
I can already spare task manager?

660
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:45,019
Really?

661
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:46,719
Holy shit.

662
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,400
Yeah, let's go.

663
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:57,019
Oh, yeah.

664
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:00,650
Whoa.

665
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:04,760
It's because you got them all right.

666
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,239
Oh, okay.

667
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:08,590
Nice.

668
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,559
All right.

669
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:14,590
Second floor.

670
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:14,989
Oh, wait.

671
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,429
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

672
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,960
Not doing that yet.

673
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:25,019
Three, two, three.

674
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:26,139
Oh, I can't walk through that?

675
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,440
Huh?

676
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,000
Oh, shit.

677
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,420
Why?

678
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:55,199
Oh, it's the hacker.

679
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,079
Hacker.

680
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,199
Oh, for God's sake, it's a hacker.

681
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,420
Hacker.

682
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:03,550
He became lost in the craftsmanship.

683
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,559
Come here.

684
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,579
I'm the hacker.

685
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:12,480
I got the feeling there's a secret back door in this room.

686
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,900
Where could it be?

687
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:19,179
I'm the hacker.

688
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:22,780
Secret back door.

689
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,280
Chainmail.

690
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,400
Secret back door.

691
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,650
He became lost in the craftsmanship.

692
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:37,019
He became lost in the...

693
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:38,139
Wait, did his head just...

694
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,019
His head's an arrow.

695
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,360
Is he, like, pointing to it?

696
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,860
Is he, like, pointing up?

697
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,059
He's, like, pointing his finger up.

698
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,289
Is it...

699
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:48,789
Is that what...

700
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:50,590
Yeah.

701
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,309
Okay, I got it.

702
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:54,349
Secret switch.

703
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,099
I was wondering.

704
00:55:58,099 --> 00:55:59,139
I thought I was seeing things.

705
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:00,659
His head, like, turned into a pointer.

706
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:09,409
Okay.

707
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:17,949
I thought I was seeing things.

708
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:18,449
Switch.

709
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,340
Whoa.

710
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,300
You walked past it?

711
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,800
What'd I do?

712
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:24,079
What?

713
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:31,360
What is it?

714
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,929
You got it.

715
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:33,730
What are you talking about?

716
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,130
You're fine.

717
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:34,630
Yeah, what?

718
00:56:35,409 --> 00:56:39,539
You guys need to relax and stop it.

719
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,340
Whoa, this is a secret entrance.

720
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:53,199
Okay, so then what does this do?

721
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,460
First, use the key...

722
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,300
Oh, this is the secret.

723
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,500
I found it.

724
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:03,099
I got it.

725
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,059
The key gen just went in there.

726
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:07,619
We're going to the...

727
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:08,980
First, you want us to stay here?

728
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,599
Sure, whatever.

729
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,840
Me and Rousey will have fun without you.

730
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,059
Oh, shit.

731
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:34,239
God.

732
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:51,389
Hey.

733
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:57,730
There was nothing in there.

734
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,559
Wait a minute.

735
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,360
Chain mail.

736
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,900
Put the chain mail on.

737
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:07,659
And the...

738
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,099
Whoa, why is frayed bow tie better?

739
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:11,090
What?

740
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:21,900
How come I got enough shit on?

741
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,800
Bye!

742
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:34,460
Holy shit, I didn't think that was gonna happen that quickly.

743
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,940
One of these is fake.

744
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:39,360
One.

745
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,000
Two.

746
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,800
Three.

747
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,039
Four.

748
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:42,719
I'm closing my eyes and flipping a coin.

749
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,599
Closing my eyes, flipping a coin.

750
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,320
Flip, flip, flip, flip.

751
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,820
It's tails.

752
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,139
To open the treasure, inside was one dark dollar.

753
00:58:49,139 --> 00:58:54,019
One dark dollar was added to your money hole.

754
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:54,420
Got it.

755
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,219
That was right.

756
00:58:55,219 --> 00:59:19,440
That's the deal.

757
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:23,739
Oh, shit.

758
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:24,300
I can't leave.

759
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,440
No.

760
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,219
I'm not spinning this.

761
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:57,360
What was that?

762
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:00,539
Sounds like a force field powering down.

763
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,090
Oh, the one upstairs.

764
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,039
What the fuck?

765
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:16,079
I wasn't ready for this shit.

766
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,280
I'm using the controller.

767
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,400
What the fuck?

768
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,260
I didn't know that was gonna happen.

769
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,420
I have the dumb ass controller in my hand.

770
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,099
I can't, you can't spin with the controller.

771
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:32,300
Okay, I'm gonna have to use the key.

772
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,260
What am I gonna do with that one?

773
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,139
D-pad?

774
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:52,860
No, I'm gonna use the, I'm gonna use the probably keypad.

775
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,610
Arrow keys.

776
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,860
All right, let's go.

777
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,099
Arrow keys.

778
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:58,300
All right, I'm ready.

779
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:59,420
Arrow keys.

780
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,920
Go.

781
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,800
Holy shit, this is fucking hard.

782
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,599
All right, let's go for it.

783
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:19,730
I'm trapped here until I get out.

784
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:42,289
Okay, I gotta get it down.

785
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,400
Fuck.

786
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,360
Fuck.

787
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,500
It's like the, you know what it is?

788
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,420
It's like the wrapping thing for my brain.

789
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,460
I don't know why.

790
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,739
Okay, if anybody else feels like this, you tell me if I'm accurate, right?

791
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:13,739
I don't know why when it comes to like things that spin, it inverts itself in my brain.

792
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:18,769
If I have to like scrap around left to get to right,

793
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,929
it's almost like I have to go right to get to left.

794
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:22,289
It's like, it's reversed in my brain.

795
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:26,960
Same, same.

796
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,599
Yeah, same.

797
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,320
Yeah, no, thanks.

798
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,510
That was a good effort.

799
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:34,659
Will he beat the teacup wheel this time?

800
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,829
Um, do I, do I have to, I'm gonna wait for the prediction to be in?

801
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:46,099
Okay, it's the shadows.

802
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,460
Yeah, I know, I know.

803
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:51,059
Um, it's just, look, my brain's gotta, my brain, I don't know why I said it like that.

804
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,420
Will I beat the teacup this round?

805
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,099
Okay, and let's go.

806
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,219
Fucking hell.

807
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,949
It's the, it's the going left and right.

808
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:14,989
I'm not gonna be able to do this.

809
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:17,949
It's like the rotating motion.

810
01:03:17,949 --> 01:03:19,150
It's not left and right.

811
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,030
It's like wrapping.

812
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:28,980
I almost think I should just go one direction.

813
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,900
I'm trying to look at the shadows on the ground.

814
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,139
But like when I go, oh, I have to go left.

815
01:03:33,139 --> 01:03:38,019
But where I currently am, like I could go right around and get there faster.

816
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,380
But you have to go left.

817
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,460
I hate circles.

818
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,739
I can't, I don't like rotating.

819
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:49,340
All right, these predictions are not gonna happen as fast as these attempts are gonna be.

820
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:50,900
I'm going.

821
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:15,170
What the fuck?

822
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,889
I did.

823
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:21,489
Oh, I feel bad for people that bet last time.

824
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:33,739
Not over yet though.

825
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:34,780
If I die here, I'm gonna stop.

826
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:38,059
I need to take an item.

827
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:39,179
I don't care.

828
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:56,659
I almost ate the poison.

829
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:23,409
What?

830
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:25,010
Oh, I'll give you a good one.

831
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:25,969
I'm gonna give you a really good one.

832
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:26,469
Ready?

833
01:05:26,849 --> 01:05:28,460
I have to like kind of prepare for it.

834
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,980
It's got to be like pressure.

835
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,900
The thing to do the Monka S very well.

836
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,980
Yeah, it's a lot of pressure in your like upper throat.

837
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,480
Monka S.

838
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,199
No, that was bad.

839
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:42,880
Monka S.

840
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:44,590
Monka S.

841
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:45,469
There we go.

842
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:49,730
I have just like poison in my inventory.

843
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:50,769
I don't have any.

844
01:05:50,769 --> 01:05:51,409
I have nothing.

845
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:55,119
All right, Revive Mint, the cookie.

846
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:58,219
Ooh, spaghetti.

847
01:05:58,219 --> 01:05:58,860
30H.

848
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,380
No, I need more items.

849
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,579
Can I buy something for somebody?

850
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,300
I just do try this with no items or something.

851
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:04,860
I'm gonna lose.

852
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,260
There's gonna be like a secret fight back here.

853
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,659
It's gonna be like Jevil 2 and I'm gonna lose instantly.

854
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:35,619
Go back to the shop.

855
01:06:35,619 --> 01:06:36,739
I think I'm gonna go back to the shop.

856
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:39,869
Yeah, I'm going back to the shop.

857
01:06:39,869 --> 01:06:44,539
I'm gonna stock up on heals.

858
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:47,420
I'm gonna do the thing I do in every single RPG.

859
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,619
Well, I don't have a party, but...

860
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,980
So every time I played an RPG, I was so bad at them.

861
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,079
It was terrible.

862
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,639
I would just...

863
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:57,280
It took me like probably like a few years,

864
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,079
maybe like five to ten years after playing a lot of RPGs for SNES.

865
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,440
No, no.

866
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,000
What? What are you doing?

867
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,320
What are you doing?

868
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,760
What? Back seat, back seat, chat, chill.

869
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,320
What are you talking about?

870
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:06,269
Stop him.

871
01:07:06,269 --> 01:07:07,630
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

872
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:10,139
Do I close this out if I go up?

873
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,809
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

874
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:15,570
Am I gonna luck it up if I go up?

875
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:16,210
All right, whatever.

876
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:16,710
Fine.

877
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:24,590
So anyways, I would be so bad at these games

878
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:28,030
that I would fill my entire inventory with the revive...

879
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,110
Whatever it was in the game.

880
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:33,630
Whether it was a revive juice or a like cure

881
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,469
that brought the person back to life.

882
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:38,110
People would just die and I would do revive on them.

883
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,710
I wouldn't even try to heal them.

884
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:42,690
I think at some point, like when I played the Mario RPG,

885
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:46,960
I'd have like 80% pick me up so we're in my inventory.

886
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:47,599
And nothing else.

887
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,519
I wouldn't even use mushrooms or heals or anything.

888
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:56,380
Though I just like didn't get it.

889
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:00,050
Oh, the back seaters are getting back seated.

890
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,099
Oh, shit.

891
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,179
That's a level I didn't think we'd reach today.

892
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,519
The back seaters in chat are being back seated

893
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,900
by people back seating them.

894
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,460
Huh?

895
01:08:13,539 --> 01:08:21,279
There's nothing interesting.

896
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,739
There's nothing interesting.

897
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,170
There's nothing interesting.

898
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,229
Nothing.

899
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:28,239
Nothing.

900
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,439
There's gonna be a screamer in one of these.

901
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,210
There's something shining inside the old machine.

902
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,590
Do you take it?

903
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:50,909
Yes.

904
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,159
The empty disk was added to your key items.

905
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,350
Oh, I got the disk.

906
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:56,909
I got the disk.

907
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:57,229
I got it.

908
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:57,470
I got it.

909
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:57,710
I got it.

910
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:58,829
It comes to the Indiana Jones part.

911
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:27,149
Empty disk.

912
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:28,829
A data disk from a strange machine.

913
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:30,109
Didn't someone want this?

914
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,420
I'm gonna bring it back.

915
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:33,899
Oh, God.

916
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:34,699
This is gonna get weird.

917
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:54,609
Come on, Susie.

918
01:09:54,609 --> 01:09:55,890
Give me my glasses back.

919
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:57,890
Look at me.

920
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:58,689
Oh, look at me.

921
01:09:58,689 --> 01:09:59,090
Look at me.

922
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:00,850
I'm a big dweeb that loves homework.

923
01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:04,020
Come on.

924
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:06,350
Fine.

925
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:06,909
Take them back.

926
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:08,800
Thank you.

927
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:10,079
Oh, Chris.

928
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:10,640
Everything okay?

929
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:13,260
Yes.

930
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:14,460
Whatever.

931
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:14,859
Let's go.

932
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:15,579
All right.

933
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,420
Cool.

934
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,380
I got the data disk.

935
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,770
I got the data disk.

936
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,229
Cafe.

937
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:29,390
Welcome to the cafe.

938
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:29,630
All right.

939
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,590
So we've got butt juice.

940
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:31,310
100 HP.

941
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,670
I'm gonna buy like a shitload of these.

942
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:39,039
Is that too many?

943
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,310
I don't know.

944
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:42,750
I'm playing this like I play every RPG.

945
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,029
I just buy a shitload of them.

946
01:10:44,029 --> 01:10:47,680
I'm buying another one.

947
01:10:48,239 --> 01:11:00,369
Okay.

948
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:00,689
Get this.

949
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:01,890
What do I want?

950
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:02,850
The Lancer Cookie.

951
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:03,329
Heals one.

952
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:04,050
Maybe I should keep it.

953
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:10,609
Is it Lancer Cookie?

954
01:11:10,609 --> 01:11:11,090
Should I just get it?

955
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:11,729
I'm getting rid of this.

956
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:14,689
Revive Mint.

957
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:15,250
Spaghetti.

958
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:15,489
Yeah.

959
01:11:15,489 --> 01:11:16,210
This 30 HP.

960
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:16,689
30 HP.

961
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,409
This is a revive.

962
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,520
I don't think I want this.

963
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,560
I want heals.

964
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:30,260
All right.

965
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,020
I just have my full inventory of healing.

966
01:11:32,659 --> 01:11:33,760
T is a heal.

967
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:40,109
It heals more in battle.

968
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:41,310
Well, we're gonna try it like this.

969
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,710
Because if this is like a big fight that I'm doing,

970
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,390
I'm gonna go for it.

971
01:11:45,949 --> 01:11:48,750
Let's go bring it.

972
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,390
Let's go bring it to him and see what happens here.

973
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,149
I have a feeling this is gonna be...

974
01:11:53,149 --> 01:11:53,949
He's gonna freak out.

975
01:11:54,590 --> 01:12:07,840
I'm gonna give him the data disk and he's gonna be like...

976
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,960
All of a sudden you can start here and like...

977
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,119
That's how you know like here it comes.

978
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:14,720
Like Toby Fox is gonna give you a banger.

979
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:17,149
I'm gonna go in the inventory.

980
01:12:17,789 --> 01:12:18,430
Here it comes.

981
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:19,550
I'm gonna put it into...

982
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:19,949
Oh, yeah.

983
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:20,670
You brought the disk.

984
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:21,789
Enter.

985
01:12:21,789 --> 01:12:22,029
Buy.

986
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,609
Oh, you should have done that.

987
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:30,989
Hey, everyone.

988
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:31,869
It's me.

989
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:35,699
Okay.

990
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:36,500
Talking.

991
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,859
Give disk.

992
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:41,069
Okay.

993
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:41,949
Well, I have it saved.

994
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:42,829
So this is a bad idea.

995
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:43,949
We'll see what happens.

996
01:12:43,949 --> 01:12:46,159
There we go.

997
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:46,800
Give disk.

998
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:48,960
Chris.

999
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,520
You did it.

1000
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,159
You...

1001
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:50,640
Wee.

1002
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,840
A little wormy.

1003
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,640
You brought me the disk.

1004
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,640
Oh, gee mama.

1005
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,399
I can feel that smooth taste already.

1006
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,560
Now, Chris, don't be greedy.

1007
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:58,880
Hand it over.

1008
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,359
Give me the disk.

1009
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,079
Then we will transfer my...

1010
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,920
Then, Chris, after this is very, very important,

1011
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,800
go back and put the disk back where you got it.

1012
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,399
Do that and you have my special guarantee.

1013
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:16,239
I will pass my savings on to you.

1014
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:19,659
Every big, every shot, every...

1015
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:21,579
All yours, Chris.

1016
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,529
So what do you say, big shot?

1017
01:13:25,729 --> 01:13:26,449
Warning.

1018
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,529
If you consent to the terms and agreements,

1019
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:36,340
our store is permanently closing down.

1020
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,939
Finally, I knew you would...

1021
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,300
Chris, here I go.

1022
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:41,779
Begin to...

1023
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:44,020
Oh.

1024
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:57,390
So he's in the disk.

1025
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:01,149
That was the worst noise.

1026
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:04,029
So wait, he's in the disk?

1027
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,119
Load it.

1028
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:09,600
A strange...

1029
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,359
You can feel it smiling in your hand.

1030
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:15,199
Now we go put this back in the machine.

1031
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,989
Throw the disk away.

1032
01:14:22,989 --> 01:14:26,079
Okay.

1033
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:26,479
Mansion.

1034
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,949
Save it.

1035
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:42,449
Okay.

1036
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:45,180
Put it back in here.

1037
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,050
And then what?

1038
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,109
I'm alone, though.

1039
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:51,869
Wait a minute.

1040
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:56,300
If I'm alone down here and I have to fight him in this...

1041
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,819
I feel like I'm going to have to fight him.

1042
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:59,760
I feel like I don't want spaghetti code.

1043
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:04,739
I don't care.

1044
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:05,140
Whatever.

1045
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:05,699
Fuck it.

1046
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:27,060
Okay, here we go.

1047
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:34,180
There's a slot for a disk.

1048
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,779
Insert the loaded disk.

1049
01:15:35,779 --> 01:15:36,020
Yes.

1050
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:39,060
Put the disk into the broken down mechanism.

1051
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:41,090
Nothing happened.

1052
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,680
Tapped the mechanism.

1053
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:47,039
Nothing happened.

1054
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,199
Shook the mechanism.

1055
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:49,760
You hit it.

1056
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:50,880
You kicked it.

1057
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,229
Nothing happened.

1058
01:15:53,229 --> 01:16:10,430
I feel like I have to do this.

1059
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:12,510
Give me a sec.

1060
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:17,409
Yeah, put it in MonkaW mode, please.

1061
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:18,689
Give me one sec.

1062
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:21,869
I just want to do something very quickly.

1063
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:26,180
I feel like I'm going to have to put this on.

1064
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:32,270
Because it's going to be probably an interesting,

1065
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,470
interesting new voice I'm going to have to do.

1066
01:16:36,109 --> 01:16:39,899
Let's go ahead and check it out.

1067
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:41,260
Let's see if that's a...

1068
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:55,329
Let's see.

1069
01:16:55,329 --> 01:16:56,369
He's going to be a robot.

1070
01:16:56,369 --> 01:16:57,409
That's just a guarantee.

1071
01:16:57,409 --> 01:16:59,489
It's literally a guarantee.

1072
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:00,850
There's no way he's not a robot.

1073
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:05,680
Right, yeah.

1074
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,020
Let's do...

1075
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,140
Let's go with this one.

1076
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:09,020
This one sounds pretty good.

1077
01:17:09,579 --> 01:17:10,220
I like this one.

1078
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:11,890
I like this one.

1079
01:17:11,890 --> 01:17:12,850
How does this one sound?

1080
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,130
Does this one hurt your ears?

1081
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,250
It kind of hurts my ears.

1082
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:16,670
No?

1083
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,149
Yay?

1084
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:17,869
Nay?

1085
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:18,590
Which one?

1086
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:23,100
You can't hear it?

1087
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,020
Oh, I'm so excited.

1088
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:25,899
I can't believe it.

1089
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:30,819
I can't wait to tell you when I have them for you.

1090
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:31,060
All right.

1091
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:32,659
Although it doesn't hurt your ears when I scream.

1092
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,140
Nay?

1093
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,100
She had a lot of nays.

1094
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:36,659
Seriously.

1095
01:17:36,659 --> 01:17:38,420
She had a lot of nays here.

1096
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:44,659
How's this?

1097
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:46,579
How's this?

1098
01:17:46,579 --> 01:18:04,479
This is normal?

1099
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,369
I got to get in the mood to do this.

1100
01:18:16,369 --> 01:18:22,960
I'm back.

1101
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,029
All right, here we go.

1102
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:34,289
Oh, God.

1103
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:46,149
Big.

1104
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:47,350
Big.

1105
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:59,680
Becoming better.

1106
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:21,489
So I think I should go.

1107
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:32,579
Send us in that little soul you have.

1108
01:19:32,579 --> 01:19:41,640
Chris.

1109
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,380
The hell was that weirdo?

1110
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,659
Chris, we were worried about you.

1111
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:48,159
So...

1112
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,250
Here it comes.

1113
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:25,439
What are we doing?

1114
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:27,979
What are we doing?

1115
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,260
Whoa.

1116
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:33,390
Oh, shit.

1117
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,430
This is a shmup.

1118
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:36,720
This is a shmoop.

1119
01:20:39,819 --> 01:20:41,100
It's a charge shot.

1120
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,899
Oh, fuck.

1121
01:20:41,899 --> 01:20:42,699
Okay, here we go.

1122
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,470
Chris.

1123
01:20:45,470 --> 01:21:04,399
It's time to make a big shot.

1124
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:04,899
Let's go.

1125
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,260
Spamton Neo.

1126
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:11,520
Okay, snap.

1127
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,159
Snap all.

1128
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:12,960
Let's try snap all.

1129
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,279
Everyone snapped wires.

1130
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,319
This isn't spotty, just heavenly.

1131
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,119
This is a fucking banger.

1132
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:22,520
Got to go up.

1133
01:21:23,539 --> 01:21:25,489
Let's go.

1134
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,210
Three times the firepower,

1135
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:29,090
two times the waterpower,

1136
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,050
and best of all, flying head.

1137
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:36,579
All right, get it.

1138
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:41,300
Hold and release, beat a fire, big shot.

1139
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,699
Again.

1140
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:50,880
Snap all.

1141
01:21:51,739 --> 01:21:55,020
We'll turn those shmoes and dames

1142
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,979
into a rose and grave.

1143
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:57,989
Oh, God.

1144
01:21:58,529 --> 01:22:09,890
Bring it on.

1145
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:11,189
Come on.

1146
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:17,020
Don't you want to be part of my beautiful heart?

1147
01:22:17,659 --> 01:22:19,500
Or did you need a little special tool?

1148
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,060
I probably shouldn't hit him.

1149
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:28,100
I don't know if I should be shooting him.

1150
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:30,510
Isn't that bad?

1151
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,140
I don't think I should shoot him.

1152
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:33,859
I don't want to shoot him.

1153
01:22:33,859 --> 01:22:34,359
Stop shooting him.

1154
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:39,220
All right, how are we doing on health?

1155
01:22:39,859 --> 01:22:44,430
Okay, I'm going to use a spaghetti gun.

1156
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:51,270
Snap.

1157
01:22:52,289 --> 01:22:58,100
All you got to do is go big.

1158
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:03,710
Are you serious?

1159
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:05,310
It's for you.

1160
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:14,930
Ooh.

1161
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:18,319
Don't let him get in here.

1162
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,460
All right, again.

1163
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:20,899
Snap all.

1164
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,779
That's calling, Chris.

1165
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:26,739
My heart, my hand.

1166
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:37,109
Good.

1167
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,140
You need another heal?

1168
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,640
No, I'm not.

1169
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,140
I'm good.

1170
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:45,699
Look at my eyes, look at my nose,

1171
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:46,260
look at my mouth.

1172
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:57,779
Got to heal.

1173
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,520
We got to do fuck juice on me.

1174
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,489
Everybody heal.

1175
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:15,649
Everybody take a butt juice.

1176
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:16,869
Back to full.

1177
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:20,869
Come on.

1178
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:25,010
Can't stand it.

1179
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:45,279
Again.

1180
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:46,460
What do you have right now?

1181
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:48,300
Almost halfway there.

1182
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:48,800
Let's go.

1183
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:53,619
I got enough heals, I think.

1184
01:24:54,260 --> 01:25:07,920
Again.

1185
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,149
I got to be careful here.

1186
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:15,460
I got to heal after this.

1187
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:26,560
All right, heal.

1188
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:28,699
We're getting code.

1189
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,210
We're getting code twice.

1190
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:39,680
Go.

1191
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,250
Again.

1192
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:59,279
All right, only like four or five more times and that's it.

1193
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:20,199
All right, we got somebody down.

1194
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:23,500
Revive.

1195
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:26,920
Revive Mint on Susie.

1196
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:34,539
Let's go.

1197
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:53,800
Come on.

1198
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,250
All right, I'm going to fight.

1199
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:14,619
Pretty bad.

1200
01:27:15,779 --> 01:27:16,739
80 percent.

1201
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:17,239
Come on.

1202
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:21,399
All right, so what do we got for health?

1203
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:24,520
Okay, here's what we're going to do here.

1204
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:26,779
Seven.

1205
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:27,659
14.

1206
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,640
Okay, let's go.

1207
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:34,310
I need to go.

1208
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,810
Where's Ralsei?

1209
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:38,069
I'm going to revive Mint on Susie.

1210
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:47,539
And then Ralsei is going to do a heal prayer on Ralsei.

1211
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:48,979
All right, let's go.

1212
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:53,239
F1 for help.

1213
01:27:53,239 --> 01:27:53,880
Oh, shit.

1214
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:58,640
It's for me.

1215
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,470
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1216
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,869
What's he doing?

1217
01:28:00,869 --> 01:28:01,369
Is he healing?

1218
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:04,149
It smells like rotten glass.

1219
01:28:04,789 --> 01:28:09,760
Get those fucking wires cut.

1220
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,260
Now.

1221
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:17,619
Oh, God.

1222
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:29,210
Whoa.

1223
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:36,550
Whoa.

1224
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:40,079
Stage lights are shattered.

1225
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,680
He's almost there.

1226
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:42,739
This is it.

1227
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,539
Snap it.

1228
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,489
He's right there.

1229
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,020
Help.

1230
01:29:07,159 --> 01:29:13,720
That's it.

1231
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,640
It's over.

1232
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:19,140
I win.

1233
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:21,180
That's it.

1234
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,199
Yeah, I'm going to snap the wire on him and then see you later, spare.

1235
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:27,699
That's it.

1236
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:28,199
I win.

1237
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:36,600
Let me make sure it's actually going to work.

1238
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:39,220
Let's just make sure.

1239
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:41,060
Yeah, game over.

1240
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:41,560
I win.

1241
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:42,439
Get out of here.

1242
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:51,539
Oh, I got to keep it going.

1243
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:55,750
I got to first try the secret bosses in every chapter, right?

1244
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,250
I have to.

1245
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:02,470
What?

1246
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,970
Oh, hold on.

1247
01:30:27,569 --> 01:30:59,670
God, he's just dead.

1248
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:05,510
Oh, God.

1249
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:08,600
That's kind of sad.

1250
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:18,000
It seems after all, I couldn't be anything more than a simple puppet.

1251
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:23,840
But you three, you're strong with a power like that.

1252
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,199
Maybe you three can break your own strings.

1253
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,279
Let me become your strength.

1254
01:31:30,279 --> 01:31:37,729
You got shadow crystal.

1255
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:40,229
You got deal maker.

1256
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:45,220
Oh, I liked him.

1257
01:31:45,779 --> 01:31:50,579
I actually like that guy a lot.

1258
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:54,050
All right, what is it?

1259
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:58,500
So we've got deal maker.

1260
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:04,739
Ooh, fashionable pink and yellow glasses greatly increases money gained and a shit

1261
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:05,859
lot of other stuff.

1262
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:13,619
We should probably, Rousey should probably have this, right?

1263
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:19,170
Yeah, give this to Rousey.

1264
01:32:22,979 --> 01:32:24,119
What was the other thing?

1265
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:24,920
There was something else, too.

1266
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,300
Wasn't there something else?

1267
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:35,670
Shadow crystal.

1268
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:38,470
A sharp shadow moves like water in the hand.

1269
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,069
You have collected one.

1270
01:32:40,069 --> 01:32:47,199
Fun fact, if you beat him with a full inventory,

1271
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,159
he gets really pissed.

1272
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,479
You get the other one from Jevil.

1273
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,380
Oh, well, I did do that.

1274
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,819
It's on a different computer.

1275
01:32:58,819 --> 01:33:08,159
That was really cool.

1276
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:08,640
That was fun.

1277
01:33:09,649 --> 01:33:11,890
That was a little intense, you know.

1278
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,560
I'm setting myself up for a lot of defeat here

1279
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:21,829
because I can't just be beat the secret boss Andy on first try.

1280
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,909
I mean, that's not going to happen three times in a row, right?

1281
01:33:23,909 --> 01:33:24,710
Like in no way.

1282
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,350
I feel like that's I'm adding.

1283
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:28,710
I'm not going to be able to do that.

1284
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:30,079
I'm going to have to though.

1285
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,079
I have to be like three and oh,

1286
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:39,140
there's a save game editor for chapter two

1287
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:41,060
and a chapter one editor is in the works.

1288
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,739
You want to create a single PC save.

1289
01:33:42,739 --> 01:33:43,460
Oh, OK, that's cool.

1290
01:33:46,439 --> 01:33:47,159
Ever a pee break?

1291
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:48,279
Yeah, it's a good idea.

1292
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:49,239
Let's take a pee break.

1293
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:53,619
I'll be right back and we'll continue on in a second.

1294
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:34,579
Hey, what's up?

1295
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:35,380
I'm not back yet.

1296
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:37,140
I'm just letting you know I'm going to be another minute or two

1297
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:40,789
because I'm making a coffee back in like two more minutes.

1298
01:35:41,350 --> 01:41:46,239
OK, OK, OK, I'm back.

1299
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:46,640
I'm back.

1300
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,140
Sorry.

1301
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,600
I've made a coffee and that led to me getting a snack,

1302
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,159
which led to me having to like get that right.

1303
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,199
Look, I'm sorry.

1304
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,359
Snack was very good, though.

1305
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,920
It was because of the Duke's sausages.

1306
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:09,189
They're very good.

1307
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,590
The chorizo and lime Duke sausages.

1308
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,390
Holy moly.

1309
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,189
They're very, very good.

1310
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,819
They're like the little like meat snacks.

1311
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:22,369
Highly recommend the chorizo and lime if you haven't had it.

1312
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:27,510
Yeah, this is scary music.

1313
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:29,670
I didn't even realize that.

1314
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,670
OK, you guys can't see anything, but now you can.

1315
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:48,880
So let's go back this way that we came.

1316
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:52,949
Those are dog treats.

1317
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:00,159
What's going on?

1318
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,520
Hey, so are we seriously not going to talk about any of that?

1319
01:43:04,319 --> 01:43:05,880
It was goddamn weird.

1320
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,039
Puppets, strings, hands.

1321
01:43:08,039 --> 01:43:09,479
What the hell does any of that mean?

1322
01:43:11,409 --> 01:43:12,449
And the way he just broke.

1323
01:43:13,939 --> 01:43:15,380
I don't think it meant anything, Susie.

1324
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:18,199
It seems like it was just a corrupted program.

1325
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:22,130
Yeah, I love these things.

1326
01:43:22,130 --> 01:43:23,250
They're really crunchy.

1327
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,210
They're really small.

1328
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:25,170
I don't know.

1329
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,770
They've made it into some kind of oat milk or something.

1330
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:27,569
They're called milk bones.

1331
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:30,449
They're in a weird part of the grocery store, though.

1332
01:43:30,449 --> 01:43:33,250
They're in like the dog aisle, like the pet aisle.

1333
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:33,810
I don't know why.

1334
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:36,069
I don't know.

1335
01:43:36,069 --> 01:43:36,869
They're very, very good.

1336
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:39,720
He turned into our allies.

1337
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,600
Let's just accept it.

1338
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:46,680
Chris, you've got goosebumps.

1339
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,039
You OK?

1340
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:53,430
I'm OK.

1341
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:59,699
If you say it all strained like that, I'm not going to think you're OK.

1342
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,880
Hey, Rousey.

1343
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,000
You think Chris is OK?

1344
01:44:06,369 --> 01:44:07,810
Well, they seem a bit shocked, but

1345
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:10,630
Chris doesn't want us to worry, so

1346
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:14,800
let's not push them for now.

1347
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:16,869
I'm all right.

1348
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:19,399
Chris, I'll make some cake for you later, OK?

1349
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,479
I could even make it chocolate flavored.

1350
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:24,069
Butterscotch, simenon, whatever you want.

1351
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:32,310
Well, their stomach's rumbling, but the goosebumps aren't gone.

1352
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:37,880
Chris, if you're cold, you can share my scarf.

1353
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:42,550
Yes, every time I mispronounce a word, everyone has to talk about it.

1354
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:45,010
Whatever.

1355
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:48,600
I said simenon instead of simenon.

1356
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,640
It's very easy to do.

1357
01:44:51,329 --> 01:44:53,010
Or Susie could.

1358
01:44:53,489 --> 01:44:53,729
What?

1359
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:55,489
No hell if I'm giving you my jacket.

1360
01:44:56,289 --> 01:44:57,170
You make me cold.

1361
01:44:57,170 --> 01:44:58,930
I'm burning you knuckleheads for warmth.

1362
01:45:01,619 --> 01:45:02,100
Susie.

1363
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:04,229
Too late.

1364
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:06,390
Already imagining you guys as idiot-scented candles.

1365
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,239
You said it wrong?

1366
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,779
Cin- cinnamon.

1367
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,909
Cinnamon.

1368
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:18,119
Cinnamon.

1369
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:18,920
What is it?

1370
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,720
It's cinnamon.

1371
01:45:21,699 --> 01:45:22,260
Cinnamon.

1372
01:45:22,819 --> 01:45:26,520
I'm saying right?

1373
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:37,279
Cinnamon.

1374
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:38,159
Hup, hup.

1375
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,390
Wait, why am I going that way when I can go this way?

1376
01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:51,800
So, um, where's progression?

1377
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:52,680
This way?

1378
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,960
I think progression was this way.

1379
01:45:56,439 --> 01:45:56,680
Ow.

1380
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:02,239
I'm gonna say aluminium.

1381
01:46:04,930 --> 01:46:05,489
Aluminium.

1382
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:12,260
Hey!

1383
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:17,649
What if I do it first?

1384
01:46:18,369 --> 01:46:22,920
I win.

1385
01:46:23,479 --> 01:46:28,560
What's the score?

1386
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:47,250
Right.

1387
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:49,140
This stuff.

1388
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:51,039
Okay, the mouse did that.

1389
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:52,399
All right, should I go- should I go to the second floor?

1390
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:53,600
Should I- what's over this way?

1391
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,479
I'm gonna go to the second floor.

1392
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,439
Yeah, let's go.

1393
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,350
Oh wait, I thought I was supposed to collect them.

1394
01:47:09,479 --> 01:47:10,199
Whoops.

1395
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:11,720
It's me being a stupid dummy.

1396
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:12,279
Whoopsie.

1397
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:15,829
I wonder how many people turned their volume down

1398
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:17,670
and just like went to a different stream after that one.

1399
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:21,939
That's the hacker.

1400
01:47:22,579 --> 01:47:27,520
You know, sometimes when I do that stuff,

1401
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,600
I hope that the person's putting me through a speaker

1402
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,880
and somebody ends up walking in the room that doesn't know,

1403
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,039
doesn't care that they watched this channel.

1404
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:36,159
They might not know anything about me.

1405
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,720
And they hear that and they just go,

1406
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,479
what are you- what the fuck is- who is that?

1407
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:46,840
Like if I were to, for instance, go,

1408
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:50,369
oh, whoopsie daisy, whoopsie doodly doodly.

1409
01:47:51,010 --> 01:47:53,010
One of you- there's 11,000 people here.

1410
01:47:53,649 --> 01:47:56,210
Somebody's like, dad just came in or something,

1411
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,729
or somebody's like roommate just walked in.

1412
01:47:58,289 --> 01:48:00,689
And now they just thought like, what the fuck are you doing?

1413
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,159
There's 11,000 of you here.

1414
01:48:04,439 --> 01:48:05,880
One of you just had a roommate walk in the door.

1415
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:17,619
Welcome to the second floor dinner party, section A.

1416
01:48:17,619 --> 01:48:19,380
Please help yourself to anybody's food.

1417
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,159
Normally, I'm terrified of mice,

1418
01:48:23,159 --> 01:48:25,640
but it's okay because that one is wearing a wig.

1419
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:26,140
Okay.

1420
01:48:29,649 --> 01:48:31,409
Hey, it's me, the hacker.

1421
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:33,250
No one figured it out, but it's me.

1422
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:35,649
I've been on the download.

1423
01:48:35,729 --> 01:48:41,720
Oh, that really happened to me.

1424
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:42,600
My roommate is here.

1425
01:48:47,399 --> 01:48:47,899
Mouse?

1426
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:51,060
This guy keeps telling everyone at the party he's a hacker.

1427
01:48:51,619 --> 01:48:53,300
I don't know what to do with this information.

1428
01:48:57,010 --> 01:48:57,569
Yes, yes.

1429
01:48:57,569 --> 01:48:58,289
Queen is right.

1430
01:48:58,289 --> 01:48:59,090
Send error report.

1431
01:48:59,090 --> 01:48:59,970
Send error report.

1432
01:49:00,609 --> 01:49:04,520
I wouldn't agree more.

1433
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:05,399
Send error report.

1434
01:49:05,399 --> 01:49:06,359
Send error report.

1435
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:11,699
Newpert's moving up in the world.

1436
01:49:15,729 --> 01:49:16,930
I am mouse-a-billion.

1437
01:49:16,930 --> 01:49:19,569
I stand leagues and inches above all the other mice.

1438
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:22,130
Only Newpert remains above me still.

1439
01:49:24,979 --> 01:49:25,699
Eating a wig.

1440
01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:40,180
Whoa.

1441
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:40,739
I win.

1442
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:54,579
Let's go this way first.

1443
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:57,779
First floor.

1444
01:49:57,779 --> 01:49:58,819
No, we don't want that.

1445
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:08,520
Hey, what's the point of that?

1446
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,760
What's the point of that?

1447
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:18,229
Room has been closed due to kitchen vermin.

1448
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:21,829
Room has been closed due to kitchen.

1449
01:50:21,829 --> 01:50:36,050
Okay, so we can only go...

1450
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:36,770
I guess I can go up.

1451
01:50:44,069 --> 01:50:44,949
Oh me, oh my.

1452
01:50:44,949 --> 01:50:47,109
The kitchen is infested with vermin.

1453
01:50:47,109 --> 01:50:48,550
I knew we should have properly finished

1454
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:50,229
dumping all the cheese in that alleyway.

1455
01:50:52,130 --> 01:50:53,250
Ouch, ouch.

1456
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:54,609
The mouse can't get me up here.

1457
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,970
Even if the...

1458
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:57,649
Ow, stove is burning my feet.

1459
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:01,909
Mouse!

1460
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:04,630
And it's not wearing a wig.

1461
01:51:05,590 --> 01:51:15,920
What the hell?

1462
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,760
Mouse wheel spins into you.

1463
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:24,659
Oh shit, Space Jam came out.

1464
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:26,609
Wait, did it?

1465
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:33,439
Did?

1466
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:37,430
I forgot.

1467
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:38,550
Did it come out a long time ago?

1468
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:39,510
It came out like a month ago.

1469
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:40,630
Oh, it did?

1470
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:42,789
All right, let's catch X.

1471
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:46,260
Okay, let's...

1472
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,100
Oh my goodness.

1473
01:51:50,149 --> 01:51:50,649
Ooh.

1474
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:53,609
Rolling around at the speed of mouse.

1475
01:51:54,569 --> 01:51:57,289
That's cool.

1476
01:51:57,850 --> 01:51:58,970
Do it again, do it again, do it again.

1477
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:03,739
What?

1478
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:07,750
Rickin don't...

1479
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,630
I don't even want to say that.

1480
01:52:14,329 --> 01:52:15,050
Oh, that's weird.

1481
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:17,399
This is patting your head

1482
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:18,600
and rubbing your belly at the same time.

1483
01:52:19,319 --> 01:52:29,159
All right, I got one more.

1484
01:52:31,479 --> 01:52:35,189
I think this is the play here.

1485
01:52:35,909 --> 01:52:37,640
Okay, this is the play.

1486
01:52:38,279 --> 01:52:39,369
We're on the edges.

1487
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,539
Big Chungus is in it.

1488
01:52:46,039 --> 01:52:47,640
I hope that's not fake.

1489
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,840
I hope that's not a lie.

1490
01:52:50,489 --> 01:52:52,170
Big Chungus is in it.

1491
01:52:53,899 --> 01:52:55,500
Yeah, fucking right.

1492
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,939
What the fuck?

1493
01:52:56,939 --> 01:52:58,140
We'll take care of it from here.

1494
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:03,289
He's actually in it.

1495
01:53:03,289 --> 01:53:03,850
No, he's not.

1496
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:07,850
Big Chungus is not in the Space Jam movie.

1497
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:13,460
They're not lying for once.

1498
01:53:21,479 --> 01:53:22,199
Thanks for the help.

1499
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:24,199
We'll open up the East Dining Hall now.

1500
01:53:26,039 --> 01:53:27,979
Thank you.

1501
01:53:27,979 --> 01:53:28,460
Look it up.

1502
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:29,500
I'm not looking it up, I don't care.

1503
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:30,699
I'm gonna...

1504
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,220
If I look it up, it's real.

1505
01:53:32,779 --> 01:53:34,140
It's not real right now for me.

1506
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:35,819
If I look it up and I see it, it's real.

1507
01:53:35,819 --> 01:53:36,619
It's not real for me.

1508
01:53:36,619 --> 01:53:37,020
I'm sorry.

1509
01:53:37,899 --> 01:53:45,479
All right, East Dining Hall.

1510
01:53:45,479 --> 01:53:48,680
It would be this way.

1511
01:53:52,819 --> 01:53:56,729
Oh, we need a stream reaction.

1512
01:53:57,449 --> 01:53:58,729
No, I don't care.

1513
01:53:58,729 --> 01:54:07,159
I feel like I'm trying to scan everything

1514
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:08,279
because I don't want to miss anything.

1515
01:54:13,369 --> 01:54:13,930
It's locked.

1516
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:16,250
What's with this giant empty room anyway?

1517
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:18,729
Welcome to my extravagant dining potential.

1518
01:54:19,369 --> 01:54:20,760
Dear.

1519
01:54:21,479 --> 01:54:23,880
Only one of these delicious platters has the key.

1520
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:27,640
I am sure searching will be an addicting game of chance.

1521
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:29,939
Are we going to search all these?

1522
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:33,399
If I get it first drive,

1523
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:35,000
then you have to give me 50,000 community subs.

1524
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:46,600
Oh, key not found.

1525
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:48,279
Did you mean give up?

1526
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,939
All the platters got mixed up again.

1527
01:54:53,659 --> 01:54:57,369
I didn't say to the debt.

1528
01:54:57,369 --> 01:54:59,689
I said I get 50,000 community subs.

1529
01:54:59,689 --> 01:54:59,930
Not...

1530
01:55:00,729 --> 01:55:01,770
That was the only thing.

1531
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:03,050
There was nothing else for it.

1532
01:55:03,609 --> 01:55:04,489
All right, it's gonna be this one.

1533
01:55:05,529 --> 01:55:09,829
There's something under this one.

1534
01:55:12,649 --> 01:55:14,409
Oh, it's a dog.

1535
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:18,939
Hey, wait a sec.

1536
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:31,289
What's going on?

1537
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:45,159
Oh, you win.

1538
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:46,840
Now we just have to...

1539
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,689
It broke it.

1540
01:55:51,289 --> 01:55:52,789
What the fuck?

1541
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,119
Oh, that was awesome.

1542
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,670
Maybe minus the blatant destruction.

1543
01:56:02,470 --> 01:56:03,510
Let's go, Chris.

1544
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,949
We're almost at the third floor.

1545
01:56:11,029 --> 01:56:13,029
No, where's my secret?

1546
01:56:13,029 --> 01:56:15,189
Where's my funny joke that's supposed to be in here?

1547
01:56:18,649 --> 01:56:19,609
Supreme table.

1548
01:56:20,170 --> 01:56:23,300
You won't be able to use this without the throne of the gods.

1549
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:27,109
It's your cousin.

1550
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,590
Stop.

1551
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:29,510
That's not what I was doing.

1552
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,979
I can't sit at this unless I have the throne of the gods.

1553
01:56:33,979 --> 01:56:35,659
Why is it a giant gerbil feeder?

1554
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:49,399
All right, so let's go...

1555
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,479
Let's keel down.

1556
01:56:54,359 --> 01:56:56,100
Let's keel down this one.

1557
01:56:56,739 --> 01:56:59,529
Holdify.

1558
01:57:00,739 --> 01:57:01,619
And then we're going to...

1559
01:57:02,979 --> 01:57:03,939
No, we're not.

1560
01:57:03,939 --> 01:57:05,699
They're not going to do that.

1561
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:06,659
Here's what we're going to do.

1562
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,539
What we're going to do is we're going to warmify this one.

1563
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:11,779
And then we're going to keelify.

1564
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:13,659
All right.

1565
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:15,260
Is warm red...

1566
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:16,460
This would be warm this one.

1567
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:19,260
And then you spare this one.

1568
01:57:19,979 --> 01:57:28,970
I mean, no.

1569
01:57:28,970 --> 01:57:29,449
I got it.

1570
01:57:45,079 --> 01:57:46,119
Got a dabbing.

1571
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,789
That's still a thing, people think.

1572
01:57:48,789 --> 01:57:49,909
You're not still doing that, right?

1573
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,850
Are you?

1574
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,149
Glow shard.

1575
01:58:16,869 --> 01:58:27,239
Where is it?

1576
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:30,300
Oh, it's here.

1577
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:31,659
Shimmering shard.

1578
01:58:31,659 --> 01:58:33,420
Its value increases each chapter.

1579
01:58:34,220 --> 01:58:35,720
Damn.

1580
01:58:41,529 --> 01:58:53,539
Chout.

1581
01:58:53,539 --> 01:58:55,689
Oh, God.

1582
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:58,819
Hey, hey.

1583
01:58:58,819 --> 01:58:59,319
Chout.

1584
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:00,810
Chout.

1585
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:13,279
I thought I was supposed to collect them.

1586
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:13,779
They're blue.

1587
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:16,250
They're a different color.

1588
01:59:16,890 --> 01:59:24,539
What was that?

1589
01:59:24,539 --> 01:59:25,819
It's chocolate milk.

1590
01:59:37,229 --> 01:59:37,949
Chris.

1591
01:59:37,949 --> 01:59:38,510
Susan.

1592
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:40,029
Glad to see you arrive unwounded.

1593
01:59:40,909 --> 01:59:42,350
Now let us hasten.

1594
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:47,340
Here is a secret passageway to the roof.

1595
01:59:48,649 --> 01:59:52,329
There we can in-rescue-ify Lady Noelle.

1596
01:59:54,119 --> 01:59:54,619
Okay.

1597
01:59:55,239 --> 01:59:57,359
Let's go, Chris.

1598
01:59:59,949 --> 02:00:00,670
Oh, Chris.

1599
02:00:01,229 --> 02:00:01,729
Chris is...

1600
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,319
Chris, you and your lackey distract the queen.

1601
02:00:06,649 --> 02:00:08,010
Let's go, Susie.

1602
02:00:08,010 --> 02:00:09,210
Just the two of us.

1603
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:09,710
Ha ha ha.

1604
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:12,140
Fine.

1605
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:12,640
Whatever.

1606
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,760
Chris, do you think of me as your lackey?

1607
02:00:21,659 --> 02:00:22,159
You mean...

1608
02:00:22,699 --> 02:00:24,300
You think of me as more than a lackey?

1609
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,979
Wait, what?

1610
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:27,920
Yes.

1611
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:28,560
I mean, what do you know?

1612
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:29,060
What are you talking about?

1613
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:35,369
You're filled with the power of book holes.

1614
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:44,029
There's a book here about preventing backtracking.

1615
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,439
All right, can I...

1616
02:00:48,439 --> 02:00:48,680
Is there...

1617
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:49,180
Can I...

1618
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:50,359
What should I do?

1619
02:00:50,359 --> 02:00:51,720
I'm gonna go this way first.

1620
02:00:51,720 --> 02:00:54,079
What is this?

1621
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:58,220
The knight created the fountain and this world.

1622
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:00,960
It might be even more powerful than Queen.

1623
02:01:02,189 --> 02:01:02,689
Now.

1624
02:01:05,050 --> 02:01:07,449
Queen has been very interested in this video recently.

1625
02:01:08,170 --> 02:01:10,569
Where the knight creates the fountain by its own hand.

1626
02:01:11,289 --> 02:01:14,729
Well, it's that and Cyber City's funniest home videos.

1627
02:01:15,529 --> 02:01:19,880
This is today's dinner entertainment.

1628
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:22,520
I've heard it's called The Birth of a Fountain.

1629
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:24,039
What an elegant name.

1630
02:01:25,689 --> 02:01:26,409
Elegantly...

1631
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:27,850
Soiatic.

1632
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:34,489
We are often forced to star in those videos.

1633
02:01:35,369 --> 02:01:37,369
For now.

1634
02:01:37,369 --> 02:01:41,279
A video of someone creating a strange pillar of smoke.

1635
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,739
There's so much smoke.

1636
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:45,020
It's hard to tell who it is.

1637
02:01:45,819 --> 02:02:01,449
Statue of Birdly is wedged in the toilet.

1638
02:02:01,449 --> 02:02:04,170
You glance back at the bathroom door sign.

1639
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:06,890
The sign is a silhouette of a Birdly statue.

1640
02:02:07,529 --> 02:02:08,409
Everything checks out.

1641
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:10,510
No problem here.

1642
02:02:11,149 --> 02:02:15,020
Oh god, not this guy again.

1643
02:02:15,659 --> 02:02:18,649
What are they gonna be done in there?

1644
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:27,739
A giant lake of acid?

1645
02:02:29,069 --> 02:02:30,350
Oh, you mean the free pool.

1646
02:02:31,149 --> 02:02:32,750
You will learn to love it like family.

1647
02:02:33,630 --> 02:02:35,149
Why do you have this?

1648
02:02:35,949 --> 02:02:38,890
It is my mansion's energy source and fun to drink.

1649
02:02:40,539 --> 02:02:41,500
Bye!

1650
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:48,010
How should we pass this?

1651
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:57,159
I suppose this works.

1652
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:09,180
Now I have to think of a way to distract the queen.

1653
02:03:09,819 --> 02:03:11,420
Oh, I'm so distracted right now.

1654
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,819
Can I like get out on that?

1655
02:03:13,819 --> 02:03:22,880
Turning them blue.

1656
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,119
What are these little houses?

1657
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,920
Just tropical villas for my guest.

1658
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:31,880
Isn't that thoughtful?

1659
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,619
How would anybody fit inside?

1660
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:37,079
Shrink from the acid!

1661
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,720
Chris, get the banana!

1662
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:42,430
Chris isn't going to do what you say.

1663
02:03:43,069 --> 02:03:44,840
Where's the banana?

1664
02:03:45,399 --> 02:03:50,300
That's okay, Chris.

1665
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:50,939
It's good for you.

1666
02:03:51,739 --> 02:04:03,550
Did I not turn the other one blue?

1667
02:04:04,189 --> 02:04:05,310
So we're coming up on a tunnel.

1668
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:07,770
Oh, I didn't turn the other one blue.

1669
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:08,090
How?

1670
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:09,050
I thought I could...

1671
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:10,170
I thought I'd just drive by them.

1672
02:04:17,609 --> 02:04:20,939
There's something blocking the way.

1673
02:04:20,939 --> 02:04:23,840
I can find some way to get rid of this.

1674
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:26,729
Giant hand.

1675
02:04:27,369 --> 02:04:27,930
Okay.

1676
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:35,050
Hey, what's over here?

1677
02:04:35,770 --> 02:04:40,520
Nothing.

1678
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:47,760
Oh, shit.

1679
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,810
Um, okay.

1680
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:53,689
This one's gonna be here a fucking long time.

1681
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,319
This castle looks like it has worn many sieges.

1682
02:05:00,279 --> 02:05:07,000
Wait, you can just do this.

1683
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:11,279
What's a...

1684
02:05:11,279 --> 02:05:12,000
Wait, doesn't she have...

1685
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:12,399
Oh, no.

1686
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:14,000
That's mist rain or something, right?

1687
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,039
Wait, why do you know you don't have it?

1688
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:18,510
Where's mist healing mist?

1689
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:18,989
Oh, shit.

1690
02:05:18,989 --> 02:05:19,550
Wrong person.

1691
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:23,760
It's in the well.

1692
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:34,810
Oh, it wasn't yellow.

1693
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:37,920
Oh, that's right.

1694
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,039
Pacify on the blue.

1695
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:46,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1696
02:05:46,619 --> 02:05:46,859
I...

1697
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:48,619
It's been a while since I've had to pacify somebody.

1698
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:55,529
Ah!

1699
02:05:56,409 --> 02:06:21,199
He's losing it.

1700
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,079
Okay, it seems...

1701
02:06:23,079 --> 02:06:24,840
It seems that peace has returned to the castle.

1702
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:28,079
You opened and got a revive dust.

1703
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:32,140
Revive dust was added to your item inventory.

1704
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:50,399
No, I don't wanna.

1705
02:06:51,199 --> 02:07:29,060
Uh-oh.

1706
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:49,239
Let me just click off out of the window

1707
02:07:49,239 --> 02:07:50,439
in a place I'm not supposed to click.

1708
02:07:51,079 --> 02:07:53,359
Uh-oh.

1709
02:07:53,979 --> 02:07:55,390
Uh-oh.

1710
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:55,789
All right.

1711
02:07:55,789 --> 02:07:58,909
Let me just see if I can get over on my fucking Mac.

1712
02:07:58,909 --> 02:07:59,310
Let me just...

1713
02:07:59,310 --> 02:07:59,710
Uh-oh.

1714
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:00,109
Uh-oh.

1715
02:08:00,109 --> 02:08:00,189
Uh-oh.

1716
02:08:00,189 --> 02:08:00,510
Uh-oh.

1717
02:08:00,510 --> 02:08:00,829
Uh-oh.

1718
02:08:00,829 --> 02:08:01,149
Uh-oh.

1719
02:08:01,149 --> 02:08:02,189
Oh, whatever.

1720
02:08:02,189 --> 02:08:02,510
I can't...

1721
02:08:02,510 --> 02:08:03,710
I think my computer's frozen.

1722
02:08:08,119 --> 02:08:12,880
I'm supposed to do this.

1723
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:20,960
How do I get that?

1724
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:21,920
Because I have to do this up.

1725
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:25,369
Can I go up from here?

1726
02:08:25,369 --> 02:08:25,609
No.

1727
02:08:25,609 --> 02:08:26,569
How am I supposed to get this?

1728
02:08:29,550 --> 02:08:30,430
Oh my god.

1729
02:08:31,069 --> 02:08:32,029
What a dummy.

1730
02:08:33,149 --> 02:08:41,159
What was that?

1731
02:08:46,909 --> 02:08:47,310
You all right?

1732
02:08:49,390 --> 02:08:52,720
Is this guy...

1733
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,079
Did I talk to this guy or is he gonna fight me?

1734
02:08:55,229 --> 02:08:56,029
Thank you for your help.

1735
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:59,630
I had gone up there to do a little house cleaning and got stuck.

1736
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,159
Thank you.

1737
02:09:07,319 --> 02:09:09,920
Um...

1738
02:09:10,859 --> 02:09:22,920
I suppose we'll just have to let it go this once.

1739
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:31,340
How do I...

1740
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:31,819
Can I...

1741
02:09:31,819 --> 02:09:32,539
Um, okay.

1742
02:09:33,579 --> 02:09:33,979
Is that it?

1743
02:09:34,779 --> 02:09:46,270
I can't get over that way?

1744
02:09:46,829 --> 02:09:48,760
All right.

1745
02:09:49,399 --> 02:09:53,869
He doesn't do anything.

1746
02:09:54,750 --> 02:10:03,100
I don't...

1747
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:03,739
I don't remember...

1748
02:10:03,739 --> 02:10:04,220
I don't know how to...

1749
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:04,859
I don't know.

1750
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:05,579
I don't know how to do it.

1751
02:10:06,380 --> 02:10:07,100
No, I'm done.

1752
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:07,579
I'm done.

1753
02:10:07,579 --> 02:10:07,899
I don't...

1754
02:10:07,899 --> 02:10:08,619
I don't know how to...

1755
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:08,939
I'm done.

1756
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:11,020
Yeah, I'm fucking done.

1757
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:11,340
I'm done.

1758
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:12,140
Whatever.

1759
02:10:12,140 --> 02:10:12,779
This game's like...

1760
02:10:12,779 --> 02:10:13,260
Whatever.

1761
02:10:13,260 --> 02:10:14,699
It's like just fucking two artists and shit.

1762
02:10:14,699 --> 02:10:15,180
It's stupid.

1763
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:16,539
No, I'm done.

1764
02:10:16,539 --> 02:10:16,859
I'm done.

1765
02:10:17,899 --> 02:10:18,380
That's done.

1766
02:10:18,380 --> 02:10:19,260
I'm done.

1767
02:10:19,260 --> 02:10:19,899
I don't want to do this.

1768
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:24,699
But what about this over here?

1769
02:10:25,579 --> 02:10:26,779
Gamer rage.

1770
02:10:26,859 --> 02:10:30,060
Dear guests, please note our mice will turn at every crossing.

1771
02:10:30,699 --> 02:10:33,340
Our vermin have been specifically hand picked for higher turning.

1772
02:10:33,979 --> 02:10:40,439
I found one dollar.

1773
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:41,399
You didn't get any.

1774
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:42,680
What the fuck?

1775
02:10:47,149 --> 02:10:48,510
No, I don't want to...

1776
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:53,039
No!

1777
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:54,239
They found 20 dollars.

1778
02:10:54,880 --> 02:11:10,670
Sounds like the bridge was raised.

1779
02:11:18,439 --> 02:11:19,239
Drop that.

1780
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:19,960
Ah, it's gonna clap.

1781
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:28,520
Looks like the hand is out of the way now.

1782
02:11:29,079 --> 02:11:40,829
Let's go.

1783
02:11:46,359 --> 02:11:47,720
Sound of progress, my friend.

1784
02:11:54,510 --> 02:11:55,069
Chris.

1785
02:11:55,069 --> 02:11:55,550
Hey, Chris.

1786
02:11:56,670 --> 02:12:00,590
Is it strange to say it's nice spending time alone with you like this?

1787
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,680
I like hanging out.

1788
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:12,640
I like spending time.

1789
02:12:14,489 --> 02:12:18,300
But I wouldn't say it's necessarily strange.

1790
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:19,340
What do you mean strange?

1791
02:12:29,149 --> 02:12:30,029
I like hanging out.

1792
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:33,579
I'm happy to hear you say that, Chris.

1793
02:12:33,579 --> 02:12:37,260
When we first met, I was so nervous about first impressions.

1794
02:12:40,409 --> 02:12:42,250
I even hid my face so you wouldn't see.

1795
02:12:44,729 --> 02:12:46,090
How do I even be a friend?

1796
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:49,130
All I have to do is be nice is what I thought.

1797
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:53,369
But I'm starting to realize being friends is more than that, isn't it?

1798
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:55,470
Susie.

1799
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:56,829
Sometimes she isn't nice at all.

1800
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,270
She's selfish.

1801
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:58,829
She's rude.

1802
02:12:58,829 --> 02:12:59,630
She's sarcastic.

1803
02:13:00,989 --> 02:13:03,789
But isn't it wonderful that she's her?

1804
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:06,750
Is what I started thinking today.

1805
02:13:07,869 --> 02:13:09,869
Of course, Chris, it's nice that you're you.

1806
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:23,119
Just so I could like dot dot dot.

1807
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:24,640
That's not as rude.

1808
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:26,319
It's nice that you're...

1809
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:31,119
Yeah, it's nice that Rousey is Rousey.

1810
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:40,220
But I'm I just wanted I'm really trying to pay attention to the to the dark ride we're on.

1811
02:13:40,859 --> 02:13:42,859
I know that like Mickey Mouse is going to jump out a few times.

1812
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,539
Can we talk about this after the ride?

1813
02:13:46,539 --> 02:13:47,039
Huh?

1814
02:13:47,819 --> 02:13:49,180
No one's ever said that to me before.

1815
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:55,500
I mean, everything's a first for me.

1816
02:13:55,500 --> 02:14:01,689
But hearing it from you, it means a lot.

1817
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,119
I just wonder what being Rousey-like even is.

1818
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:10,989
Well, that is for you to decide, Rousey.

1819
02:14:11,069 --> 02:14:15,149
As we asked enough of me to decide this for you to decide.

1820
02:14:15,149 --> 02:14:16,989
Sorry, I got off track and I just I missed it.

1821
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:18,109
I missed it.

1822
02:14:19,149 --> 02:14:21,229
We turned the corner and fucking Ursula showed up.

1823
02:14:21,229 --> 02:14:22,829
And I wanted to see Ursula.

1824
02:14:22,829 --> 02:14:24,189
Okay, I missed it.

1825
02:14:25,149 --> 02:14:26,189
Let's just enjoy the ride.

1826
02:14:26,189 --> 02:14:26,510
Yeah.

1827
02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:27,010
Okay.

1828
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,399
Wow, Chris, look at all those houses.

1829
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:45,600
I wonder what will happen if we change their color.

1830
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:49,840
Boused worms really slottest.

1831
02:14:50,859 --> 02:14:54,300
Mouse had seen the last of me.

1832
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:54,800
Oh, no.

1833
02:14:56,569 --> 02:14:57,369
It's Captain...

1834
02:14:58,090 --> 02:14:58,890
I don't know this guy's name.

1835
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:01,920
Chips ahoyeth, landlubbers.

1836
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:07,039
Tothouth readyeth to visit David Jones' locker.

1837
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,539
Would you not speak with more than one accent?

1838
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:12,539
Yes.

1839
02:15:12,539 --> 02:15:13,039
All right.

1840
02:15:14,399 --> 02:15:16,079
Oh, Mr. Rules.

1841
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:18,649
I just remembered Lancer.

1842
02:15:18,649 --> 02:15:19,529
He's not well.

1843
02:15:21,039 --> 02:15:21,920
Oh, dear.

1844
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,000
Dinist Hower and Triumph burping him.

1845
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,000
Perhaps I'll give them a sip of my ginger ale.

1846
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,760
Oh, wait, I have more time to spare on such frivolities.

1847
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:37,720
I must just conquer this island and defeat myself.

1848
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,479
Then, I'm doing Captain Crunch.

1849
02:15:39,479 --> 02:15:41,399
It's not a bad accent, it's Captain Crunch.

1850
02:15:41,399 --> 02:15:45,930
Then gifting her a succulent island present,

1851
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:48,930
the beautiesque queen shall reward me

1852
02:15:48,930 --> 02:15:52,630
by making me her left-hand man.

1853
02:15:52,630 --> 02:15:54,909
Ah-ha-ha, me the ultimate minion.

1854
02:15:54,909 --> 02:16:00,470
Now beholdeth the formeth of thou destroyer.

1855
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:05,310
Wherever this thing is, this again.

1856
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:09,109
Ah-ha, squirming jealousy at my battle caravan

1857
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:13,829
is an effigy of an ancient god of combating.

1858
02:16:13,829 --> 02:16:17,789
I rescued this from the king's trap

1859
02:16:17,789 --> 02:16:22,289
and fixed it up in this world of scraps up.

1860
02:16:22,289 --> 02:16:27,489
It's actually a rejected design we made.

1861
02:16:27,489 --> 02:16:29,170
Oh, this is your creation normally, right?

1862
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:31,199
OK, yeah, that's fine.

1863
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:34,479
And soon, thou shalt taste this rejection,

1864
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:39,299
first this in the form of various bullets.

1865
02:16:39,299 --> 02:16:41,879
Trash machine reluctantly fights you.

1866
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:43,319
Oh, hold on a second, Goku.

1867
02:16:43,319 --> 02:16:45,040
Let me go ahead and tell you how to play.

1868
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,959
I know, I know, I was supposed to tell you.

1869
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:49,940
I'm just doing, like, the end of the episode thing.

1870
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:52,459
Wow, I wonder what's going to happen next time.

1871
02:16:52,459 --> 02:16:54,459
These two guys are spiting each other.

1872
02:16:54,459 --> 02:16:55,340
I wonder what happens.

1873
02:16:55,340 --> 02:16:57,860
Hey, hey, hey, save me a piece.

1874
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:59,780
They're always, like, eating food, right?

1875
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,520
They're always, like, talking to somebody off screen.

1876
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,120
I wonder what's going to happen next time

1877
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:06,520
machine reluctancy fighting for you.

1878
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,799
Hey, wait up for me.

1879
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:11,020
Right, why?

1880
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:17,569
Hey, give me, I'll take a piece of that cake.

1881
02:17:17,569 --> 02:17:27,639
Take house two.

1882
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:32,120
Take house, take house, take house three.

1883
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:33,840
Oh, man, what am I doing?

1884
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,799
We're claiming tile, claim you can take this tile.

1885
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:42,370
Oh, fuck, I don't know what I'm doing.

1886
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:45,659
Claim this house and this one.

1887
02:17:45,659 --> 02:17:47,260
Oh, shit, it's one of those things.

1888
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:49,239
Oops.

1889
02:17:49,239 --> 02:17:51,799
The rules, pronounced rules, are simple.

1890
02:17:51,799 --> 02:17:57,559
Hunker houses, whoever has the most wins.

1891
02:17:57,559 --> 02:17:59,000
I wasn't ready for them.

1892
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:05,040
Ow.

1893
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,600
Take house four.

1894
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:11,239
Take house two.

1895
02:18:11,239 --> 02:18:21,430
You distract.

1896
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:25,360
I'm very confused, I hope I get it.

1897
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,600
House distracted.

1898
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:32,729
Rules will place one less house next turn.

1899
02:18:32,729 --> 02:18:34,090
I have to go down, as I'm going.

1900
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:43,420
Yeah, yeah, I'm going down.

1901
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:45,700
We're going to take two houses.

1902
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,100
We need TP?

1903
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:48,819
Oh.

1904
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:54,850
Shut up, what am I doing?

1905
02:18:54,850 --> 02:19:06,899
What happens if we win?

1906
02:19:06,899 --> 02:19:09,360
Shit.

1907
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:14,639
We're going to take four houses.

1908
02:19:14,639 --> 02:19:16,069
Sorry.

1909
02:19:16,069 --> 02:19:23,340
Fuck, dear.

1910
02:19:23,340 --> 02:19:24,540
Stop, stop, stop building houses.

1911
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:33,280
I have to win.

1912
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:48,500
Wait, it's not a connect four?

1913
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:57,239
What do I have?

1914
02:19:57,239 --> 02:20:04,200
Oh, this dude's a moron.

1915
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:05,559
I mean, he's, I'm winning.

1916
02:20:05,559 --> 02:20:10,309
What are you talking about?

1917
02:20:10,309 --> 02:20:11,149
You're a dumbass.

1918
02:20:11,149 --> 02:20:12,030
Look, I'm supposed to claim,

1919
02:20:12,030 --> 02:20:14,969
I don't know what you're talking about.

1920
02:20:14,969 --> 02:20:16,610
Kiwi Herman scream.

1921
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:18,329
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1922
02:20:18,329 --> 02:20:19,690
Fuck, I tried.

1923
02:20:19,969 --> 02:20:21,889
I only had a half a second to do that.

1924
02:20:21,889 --> 02:20:24,569
I only had a half a second to get that out.

1925
02:20:24,569 --> 02:20:26,010
I didn't get like 10 minutes in a booth

1926
02:20:26,010 --> 02:20:27,209
getting prepared, okay?

1927
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:43,370
I'm winning.

1928
02:20:43,370 --> 02:21:00,700
I'm winning, I think.

1929
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:12,920
I win.

1930
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:15,469
Because, yeah, one, two.

1931
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:30,299
I won.

1932
02:21:30,299 --> 02:21:31,899
Seems the game has been over.

1933
02:21:31,899 --> 02:21:34,319
I win.

1934
02:21:34,319 --> 02:21:35,159
What?

1935
02:21:35,159 --> 02:21:37,520
How's doth hath more houses?

1936
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:39,270
Cut the battle.

1937
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:40,469
You won.

1938
02:21:40,469 --> 02:21:42,079
Yet, I won.

1939
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:47,219
Yeah, you guys are freaking out for no reason.

1940
02:21:47,219 --> 02:21:52,840
You guys are freaking out for no reason.

1941
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,399
Ah, ah, ah.

1942
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:56,620
So thou hast triumphed.

1943
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,700
Not you have only seen,

1944
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:02,239
but one percentile of my weapons abilities.

1945
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:04,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1946
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:08,260
Behold, worm, the real power of Rulf card.

1947
02:22:12,620 --> 02:22:15,620
God.

1948
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:20,719
You won by one.

1949
02:22:20,719 --> 02:22:24,420
I still won.

1950
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:27,209
Look, if I'm in first place,

1951
02:22:27,209 --> 02:22:28,409
say we're like running a marathon.

1952
02:22:28,409 --> 02:22:30,770
I'm in first place, you're in second place.

1953
02:22:30,770 --> 02:22:32,940
And I'm way ahead of you.

1954
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:34,889
I'm like 200,

1955
02:22:34,889 --> 02:22:38,239
I'd like, let's say I'm 100 fucking yards ahead of you.

1956
02:22:38,879 --> 02:22:40,860
And I fall down.

1957
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:43,739
I trip, I fall, I've scraped my knee.

1958
02:22:43,739 --> 02:22:46,000
I roll three times, I get up.

1959
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,280
A bird flies in my face, hits me in the head.

1960
02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:49,360
Like a bird shits on me.

1961
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,280
I stop for a minute.

1962
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,559
As long as I cross the finish line before you do,

1963
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:56,600
I won the game, I won.

1964
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:00,500
So what do you care?

1965
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:03,700
I can literally sit down and watch you running towards me.

1966
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:06,219
Just sit down with my legs kind of just crossed,

1967
02:23:06,219 --> 02:23:08,700
sitting there waiting for you for a hundred more yards.

1968
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:10,219
Get up and cross the finish line.

1969
02:23:10,219 --> 02:23:13,479
I will still win the race.

1970
02:23:13,479 --> 02:23:23,049
It doesn't matter how I did it, I came in first.

1971
02:23:23,049 --> 02:23:24,850
This is a bad analogy, how?

1972
02:23:24,850 --> 02:23:27,290
It's just, if you cross the finish line before somebody else,

1973
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:35,030
you won, it doesn't matter how you got there.

1974
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:39,260
That's right, rules isn't compatible with this world either.

1975
02:23:44,399 --> 02:23:45,799
Well, let's go, Chris.

1976
02:23:45,799 --> 02:23:48,590
You cheated.

1977
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:50,760
Oh, I cheated?

1978
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,600
Yeah, fine.

1979
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,479
Let's both do a blood test.

1980
02:23:53,479 --> 02:23:54,319
Okay, fine.

1981
02:23:54,319 --> 02:24:03,110
Let's both do a blood test and see what's going on.

1982
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:09,250
Looks like the right, oh, it's a good picture.

1983
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:11,209
There's a camera, it's gonna take a picture.

1984
02:24:11,209 --> 02:24:13,440
Should we pose?

1985
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:17,729
E-sign, rude gesture.

1986
02:24:17,729 --> 02:24:20,809
No, the play, you guys, the play with these things is you,

1987
02:24:20,809 --> 02:24:22,959
I try to do this every time.

1988
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:26,629
So you try to figure out where it is.

1989
02:24:26,629 --> 02:24:28,190
And then, I don't know, I sometimes do that.

1990
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:33,629
I try to pretend to be asleep or pretend to be crying.

1991
02:24:33,629 --> 02:24:35,909
Like with a horrible, like I'm fucking bawling

1992
02:24:35,909 --> 02:24:43,280
or just like I'm passed out, like my head over.

1993
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:44,799
Rude gesture.

1994
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:53,329
Oh, I'm gonna give it like the finger hug.

1995
02:24:53,329 --> 02:24:58,920
I don't know if I would do that.

1996
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,600
I honestly, if I would probably,

1997
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:03,639
I would probably either pretend to be asleep

1998
02:25:03,639 --> 02:25:06,329
or that I wouldn't like,

1999
02:25:06,329 --> 02:25:11,729
I wouldn't grab the person next to me and hug them.

2000
02:25:11,729 --> 02:25:18,430
I would give like the peace sign

2001
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:21,350
or I would give a rude, all right, let's do rude gesture.

2002
02:25:23,559 --> 02:25:24,399
What am I doing?

2003
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:27,229
Wait, what is he doing?

2004
02:25:27,229 --> 02:25:32,340
Wait, what, what the hell was that?

2005
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:33,780
What the hell just happened?

2006
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,370
What has happened?

2007
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:39,770
You know what's kinda funny?

2008
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:43,170
There are some people that if a camera,

2009
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:45,250
they go into like a weird trance.

2010
02:25:45,250 --> 02:25:49,760
If a camera exists, they'll just give it the finger.

2011
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,719
Do you guys know anybody like that in your life

2012
02:25:51,719 --> 02:25:55,120
where it just takes them over?

2013
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:57,040
It's just like, oh yeah, here comes a picture.

2014
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,040
Yeah, finger.

2015
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:00,319
It's like, why do you have to do that?

2016
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:04,239
It takes over their brain.

2017
02:26:04,239 --> 02:26:05,920
It's almost like the person doesn't really know

2018
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:09,079
what to do with their body or with their arms or hands.

2019
02:26:09,079 --> 02:26:13,760
So like raising up a middle finger is enough of a,

2020
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:15,440
like, hey, look, emotional, emotion.

2021
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:16,399
I'm like, look at what I'm doing.

2022
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:17,239
I don't know.

2023
02:26:17,239 --> 02:26:18,399
It's like there's some people that just snap

2024
02:26:18,399 --> 02:26:22,809
when a camera turns on.

2025
02:26:23,649 --> 02:26:24,690
If you go to like their,

2026
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:25,930
like let's say you check out,

2027
02:26:25,930 --> 02:26:27,850
like, oh, what do they have on Instagram?

2028
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:29,610
Oh, what's their Instagram look like?

2029
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:33,510
It's just like all pictures have given the finger.

2030
02:26:33,510 --> 02:26:36,760
Like, okay, do you have any others?

2031
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,959
It's like, oh yeah, like finger, finger, finger,

2032
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:41,750
like given the finger.

2033
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:47,409
Guys on Tinder, yeah, just like, oh yeah, finger.

2034
02:26:47,409 --> 02:26:53,680
That's king shit.

2035
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,680
But the thing is I kinda have one of those too.

2036
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,750
I usually, I'll do thumbs up.

2037
02:26:58,750 --> 02:27:02,770
I'll put thumbs up or like peace.

2038
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:04,969
I'll do like thumbs up or like fist.

2039
02:27:04,969 --> 02:27:06,559
I put my fist out.

2040
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:07,399
I don't know why.

2041
02:27:07,399 --> 02:27:10,540
It's like, okay, I do the thing

2042
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:13,340
that if you were to take a picture with a UFC fighter,

2043
02:27:13,340 --> 02:27:17,180
like, oh, hey, hey, I don't know any UFC fighters.

2044
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:18,620
I can't come up with one.

2045
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:19,659
I'm gonna make one up.

2046
02:27:19,659 --> 02:27:23,399
Hey, fighter, can I get a fit picture?

2047
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:24,559
And they do that thing with their hands

2048
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:25,840
and they put their like fist up,

2049
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,969
like, yeah, I'm gonna knock somebody out.

2050
02:27:27,969 --> 02:27:32,610
I do that.

2051
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:33,430
I don't know why.

2052
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:38,579
I put like fist up, two fists, thumbs up, fist.

2053
02:27:39,299 --> 02:27:44,520
I have no idea why I do that.

2054
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:47,079
Let's keep going.

2055
02:27:47,079 --> 02:27:49,540
Yeah, I'm a big fan of fighter.

2056
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:52,069
I thought just going to leave with me here.

2057
02:27:52,069 --> 02:28:01,729
Oh, aren't even going to throw with me the picture.

2058
02:28:01,729 --> 02:28:06,000
Why would you wanna take a picture with you?

2059
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,200
I don't know.

2060
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:10,040
I don't like, you don't, I'm not looking for that.

2061
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:27,000
If you want one, I'll do it.

2062
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,399
Chris, are you wondering how Suzy is doing right now?

2063
02:28:31,399 --> 02:28:32,239
I mean, I'll be honest.

2064
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:34,479
I actually forgot the person was in the game.

2065
02:28:34,479 --> 02:28:38,040
It's been like a while.

2066
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:40,360
I know I don't, I don't, it's not that I don't care.

2067
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:43,950
Yeah, I've been wondering.

2068
02:28:43,950 --> 02:28:46,309
Well, then why don't we close our eyes

2069
02:28:46,309 --> 02:28:47,629
and think about what she's doing now.

2070
02:28:47,629 --> 02:28:54,520
I don't want, I don't really want to do that.

2071
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:58,020
What a strange moon.

2072
02:28:58,020 --> 02:29:04,100
Like nothing I've ever seen before.

2073
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:09,790
This world, I wish Death could see it.

2074
02:29:09,790 --> 02:29:10,989
That was bad acting, I'm sorry.

2075
02:29:10,989 --> 02:29:13,520
I'll go, I'll be better.

2076
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:16,440
Is somebody there?

2077
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:18,159
Wait, what are you?

2078
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:27,260
Hey, you can't capture someone who's already captured.

2079
02:29:27,260 --> 02:29:34,069
Suzy, you saved me.

2080
02:29:34,069 --> 02:29:36,090
Don't get used to it.

2081
02:29:36,090 --> 02:29:44,479
Okay, I won't.

2082
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:47,239
Cool moon.

2083
02:29:49,079 --> 02:29:51,129
Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

2084
02:29:51,129 --> 02:29:53,100
How did we get here?

2085
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:56,760
Now, what even is this place?

2086
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:59,120
You see, a million years ago,

2087
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,049
a bomb exploded in the atmosphere.

2088
02:30:02,049 --> 02:30:05,600
You know what, it's too much for right now.

2089
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:14,899
It's Evil Queen's Castle or the Dark World.

2090
02:30:14,899 --> 02:30:24,989
I mean, aren't both of these things true?

2091
02:30:24,989 --> 02:30:32,000
You're just having a dream.

2092
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,280
Oh, oh, that's right, right.

2093
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:39,639
If you're here, it must be a dream.

2094
02:30:39,639 --> 02:30:44,159
I mean, the real Suzy probably wouldn't save me, would she?

2095
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:50,950
Probably doesn't care about me at all.

2096
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:56,379
Why would you think that?

2097
02:30:56,379 --> 02:31:00,360
She doesn't care about anybody.

2098
02:31:00,360 --> 02:31:03,959
Well, fair, but did you ever wonder

2099
02:31:03,959 --> 02:31:08,239
why Suzy never picked on you?

2100
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:11,329
All the time.

2101
02:31:11,329 --> 02:31:13,770
This is kind of an inaccurate, if you were lucid.

2102
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:16,610
If I'm lucid, it's only happened a few times,

2103
02:31:16,610 --> 02:31:18,209
but I just started, I'm lucid,

2104
02:31:18,209 --> 02:31:19,530
I'm grabbing like the fucking Biro

2105
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:20,370
and I'm throwing it out the window.

2106
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:22,610
I'm throwing it out the window, it's hard as I can.

2107
02:31:22,610 --> 02:31:27,840
Like, I'm just gonna start smashing the window.

2108
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,680
This is my one opportunity

2109
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:30,000
to like throw a Biro out of the window.

2110
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,940
I'm gonna do it.

2111
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:35,059
The second that I feel lucid, it's just like,

2112
02:31:35,059 --> 02:31:36,299
oh my fucking God, I'm gonna dream.

2113
02:31:36,299 --> 02:31:38,489
Okay, okay, I see a stick over there.

2114
02:31:38,489 --> 02:31:39,809
I'm just throwing, I'm gonna javelin the stick

2115
02:31:39,809 --> 02:31:41,850
out the window, because like, I'm gonna do that.

2116
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:42,770
That's what I'm doing in my lucid dream.

2117
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:46,840
I'm awake.

2118
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:47,680
You're ruining the moment.

2119
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:54,309
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

2120
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:57,680
Maybe it's because when she first came to class,

2121
02:31:57,680 --> 02:31:59,000
you lent her one of your pencils.

2122
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:05,139
Somebody call me a caveman.

2123
02:32:05,139 --> 02:32:06,940
Okay, we're actually ruining this.

2124
02:32:08,469 --> 02:32:10,469
Stick, I see stick.

2125
02:32:10,469 --> 02:32:11,950
Break something.

2126
02:32:11,950 --> 02:32:15,459
Smash.

2127
02:32:15,459 --> 02:32:18,459
All right, I'm gonna actually pay attention.

2128
02:32:18,459 --> 02:32:20,950
I know.

2129
02:32:20,950 --> 02:32:23,559
You lent her one of your pencils.

2130
02:32:23,559 --> 02:32:29,500
Like a dumb candy cane looking one or something.

2131
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:32,489
Even though it didn't actually taste like candy.

2132
02:32:32,489 --> 02:32:39,420
She remembered your smile and decided to spare you, you know?

2133
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:43,290
That's really specific.

2134
02:32:43,290 --> 02:32:48,229
Yeah, well, wait, did you say you ate the pencil?

2135
02:32:48,229 --> 02:32:56,090
I mean, look, hey, so do you dream about me a lot?

2136
02:32:56,090 --> 02:32:58,770
Well, time for me to get back to my project.

2137
02:33:00,129 --> 02:33:02,569
Okay, Susie, hit me with your ax and wake me up.

2138
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:06,739
No, I can't do that.

2139
02:33:06,739 --> 02:33:07,579
Why not?

2140
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:10,120
Is this a dream?

2141
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:17,950
I mean, didn't you wanna hang out some more?

2142
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:20,659
Stop voice acting?

2143
02:33:20,659 --> 02:33:23,819
You want us to hit A and we'll just read it silently together?

2144
02:33:23,819 --> 02:33:26,659
I'm reading it.

2145
02:33:26,659 --> 02:33:32,059
I'm that guy for four years.

2146
02:33:32,059 --> 02:33:36,860
I guess Birdly can wait a little longer.

2147
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:43,270
All right, let's get out of here then.

2148
02:33:43,270 --> 02:33:46,049
Now, the person out four years and Goldfish years.

2149
02:33:46,049 --> 02:33:49,079
Should be like, I don't know, probably like a few hours.

2150
02:33:49,079 --> 02:33:56,860
All we gotta do is head to the right over this.

2151
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:04,420
Over here on this, wait, this is a dream.

2152
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:12,219
Heart covered Ferris wheel.

2153
02:34:12,299 --> 02:34:15,149
God damn, hold up, get on already.

2154
02:34:15,149 --> 02:34:24,100
Sorry, what the hell am I supposed to do here?

2155
02:34:25,459 --> 02:34:28,430
Chris would know what to do.

2156
02:34:28,430 --> 02:34:32,100
Eat moss.

2157
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:34,760
Me caveman, caveman in lucid dream.

2158
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:38,700
Eat moss, break things, smash.

2159
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:45,440
Point and hearts come out.

2160
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:46,399
Did I eat the moss?

2161
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:47,440
I feel like that's weird.

2162
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:52,059
Why would somebody do that?

2163
02:34:52,059 --> 02:34:53,059
I'm gonna eat moss.

2164
02:34:54,850 --> 02:34:57,290
Actually, maybe Chris wouldn't know what to do.

2165
02:34:59,270 --> 02:35:00,829
So, Ferris wheels, huh?

2166
02:35:02,149 --> 02:35:06,170
Kinda makes you wonder what car they were built for.

2167
02:35:06,209 --> 02:35:08,329
It's different than riding one with Chris.

2168
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:10,290
What the hell's wrong?

2169
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:11,370
You scared of heights?

2170
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:14,329
No, no, I love heights, ha ha.

2171
02:35:17,319 --> 02:35:18,680
You're shaking.

2172
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:24,239
Well, maybe I'm a little scared, but I, to be honest,

2173
02:35:24,239 --> 02:35:25,680
I actually like scary things.

2174
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:27,840
What do you mean?

2175
02:35:29,059 --> 02:35:31,379
When we were little, me and my sister would stay up

2176
02:35:31,379 --> 02:35:33,739
and go past our bedtime watching horror movies.

2177
02:35:34,659 --> 02:35:37,540
At first I cried, but now it's like watching them

2178
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:38,860
makes me feel comforted.

2179
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,959
Comforted?

2180
02:35:41,959 --> 02:35:43,959
I guess I do like slime and blood.

2181
02:35:46,170 --> 02:35:48,709
Scary, but I can just turn it off, right?

2182
02:35:48,709 --> 02:35:51,110
No, it's mostly people that are scary, ha ha.

2183
02:35:56,899 --> 02:35:59,260
Just say you mean, you can just say you mean me.

2184
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:06,739
Well, I guess you too, but that's what's nice about you,

2185
02:36:06,739 --> 02:36:08,549
you know?

2186
02:36:08,549 --> 02:36:11,059
Nice, the hell does that mean?

2187
02:36:11,059 --> 02:36:13,299
You're the good kind of scary.

2188
02:36:13,299 --> 02:36:15,540
You aren't afraid to break the rules, you know?

2189
02:36:16,659 --> 02:36:26,280
Wish I could do crazy stuff like you.

2190
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:33,659
Okay, this is the difference here.

2191
02:36:33,659 --> 02:36:38,319
Nuts would be like, nuts would be like I get up

2192
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:43,090
and just start like flossing, right?

2193
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:44,930
Like, that's nuts.

2194
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:52,040
Crazy would be, I see how long I can like hold my breath for.

2195
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:54,739
Which one?

2196
02:36:54,739 --> 02:36:58,540
Or like, I see if I can like hang outside the Ferris wheel

2197
02:36:58,540 --> 02:37:00,500
with my hands, but like a photo.

2198
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:01,780
Like take a picture of me hanging outside

2199
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,219
the Ferris wheel with my hands.

2200
02:37:09,139 --> 02:37:12,360
Uh, this is crazy, a smash window.

2201
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:14,159
All right, let's do nuts.

2202
02:37:14,159 --> 02:37:18,600
So, um, you could do something crazy right now.

2203
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:19,520
What would you do?

2204
02:37:23,010 --> 02:37:28,170
Well, I jump out the window, see?

2205
02:37:28,170 --> 02:37:29,969
She gets it.

2206
02:37:29,969 --> 02:37:30,809
Huh?

2207
02:37:31,649 --> 02:37:33,049
It's a dream, right?

2208
02:37:33,049 --> 02:37:34,329
And I'm the fucking weirdo.

2209
02:37:34,329 --> 02:37:36,290
This is all you guys, all you guys' favorite character

2210
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:39,129
just said the same goddamn thing that I did.

2211
02:37:39,129 --> 02:37:42,690
I'd grow big angel wings and fly as far as I can,

2212
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:46,260
gazing back at it all.

2213
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:48,379
Skyline shining like holiday lights.

2214
02:37:50,389 --> 02:37:51,709
Window.

2215
02:37:51,709 --> 02:37:52,709
That's kind of beautiful.

2216
02:37:52,709 --> 02:37:55,229
Wait, you wouldn't seriously jump out, would you?

2217
02:37:57,579 --> 02:37:58,420
No promises.

2218
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,899
So, see?

2219
02:38:01,899 --> 02:38:03,739
What do you think looking out there?

2220
02:38:04,659 --> 02:38:05,500
Me?

2221
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:14,360
Um, I mean, do we kind of, do we say something romantic here?

2222
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:16,700
Do we say something cool?

2223
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:19,860
I think we've already done the cool bit, right?

2224
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:29,229
We already are cool.

2225
02:38:29,229 --> 02:38:30,069
Stay cool?

2226
02:38:30,069 --> 02:38:31,350
I feel like we've already been cool.

2227
02:38:31,350 --> 02:38:33,190
I feel like we've stayed cool for the first,

2228
02:38:33,190 --> 02:38:34,909
like, half of this Ferris wheel ride.

2229
02:38:34,909 --> 02:38:41,159
I think it's time to do something romantic.

2230
02:38:41,159 --> 02:38:42,000
Let's go for it.

2231
02:38:43,719 --> 02:38:47,129
Seeing everything small makes me feel like, um,

2232
02:38:47,129 --> 02:38:49,049
if I was Susie Zilla or something,

2233
02:38:49,049 --> 02:38:51,819
I could wreck the whole city.

2234
02:38:51,819 --> 02:38:53,219
Ha ha ha, Susie!

2235
02:38:54,059 --> 02:38:55,620
Eh, well, that's romantic.

2236
02:38:56,579 --> 02:38:59,219
Is being Susie Zilla something you think about a lot?

2237
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:06,350
Like, no, I just made it up now.

2238
02:39:06,350 --> 02:39:08,430
Does your tail always do that when you lie?

2239
02:39:09,549 --> 02:39:11,270
Hey, hey, don't look at that!

2240
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:15,860
I don't have a tail, it's part of your dream.

2241
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:16,979
Oh, right, sorry.

2242
02:39:20,670 --> 02:39:23,110
Guess I'll just have to check in real life, too.

2243
02:39:24,469 --> 02:39:25,309
Hey, don't.

2244
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:29,510
Susie, is everything okay?

2245
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:33,790
Look, I just, I just don't like people knowing about it.

2246
02:39:35,799 --> 02:39:39,409
Well, I think it's a nice tail.

2247
02:39:39,409 --> 02:39:44,219
Whatever, it's wagging.

2248
02:39:44,219 --> 02:39:46,440
All right, do you guys even have dogs?

2249
02:39:46,440 --> 02:39:49,639
Anytime you have a dog, if your dog's lying down,

2250
02:39:49,639 --> 02:39:53,100
just kinda hanging out, does your dog do this, too?

2251
02:39:53,100 --> 02:39:56,719
Where, if you look at your dog, right, like in the eyes,

2252
02:39:56,719 --> 02:39:58,840
or if you look over at them and they're just kinda relaxing,

2253
02:39:58,840 --> 02:40:05,940
you'll just, you'll just hear that, that's what Otto does.

2254
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:07,659
Like, you look over, you're just sitting there,

2255
02:40:07,659 --> 02:40:09,899
you might be playing a game, you're watching TV.

2256
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:11,100
Dog is on your right, they're just,

2257
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:12,700
they're not paying attention to you at all.

2258
02:40:12,700 --> 02:40:14,659
They just sense your eyeballs.

2259
02:40:14,659 --> 02:40:22,180
You turn and look, it's the cutest thing ever.

2260
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:23,260
Susie's not a dog.

2261
02:40:24,219 --> 02:40:33,229
I didn't, I didn't say that Susie was a dog.

2262
02:40:33,229 --> 02:40:36,530
You stopped shaking.

2263
02:40:36,530 --> 02:40:40,170
Yes, I got comfortable.

2264
02:40:40,170 --> 02:40:42,780
Me, too.

2265
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:46,290
Well, that wasn't too bad.

2266
02:40:46,290 --> 02:40:54,090
Yeah, if only I could dream like this every day.

2267
02:40:54,090 --> 02:40:55,010
All right, at what point do I just go,

2268
02:40:55,010 --> 02:40:56,729
all right, hey, this is not a dream.

2269
02:40:56,729 --> 02:40:58,969
This is real, this is a real thing.

2270
02:40:58,969 --> 02:41:00,889
I just was messing with you.

2271
02:41:00,889 --> 02:41:04,969
Maybe it doesn't have to be a dream, you know?

2272
02:41:04,969 --> 02:41:08,090
Susie, maybe, maybe someday we could.

2273
02:41:16,989 --> 02:41:20,270
Noel, my lady, the cavalry has arrived to rescue you.

2274
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:24,870
Oh, the good part of the dream is over.

2275
02:41:24,870 --> 02:41:27,870
It's fine, we're at least gonna help, we're allies.

2276
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:30,750
Yes, don't worry, Noel, I'm stupid now.

2277
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:36,680
He's good.

2278
02:41:36,680 --> 02:41:39,440
Look, I gotta go save the day now, all right?

2279
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:41,040
Uh-huh, good luck, Susie.

2280
02:41:41,959 --> 02:41:46,020
All right, nugget boy, it's up to you now.

2281
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:49,860
Leave everything to me, my dear Susan.

2282
02:41:52,540 --> 02:41:58,219
Yeah, whatever, may the smarts be with you.

2283
02:41:58,219 --> 02:42:01,860
Ah, she left before I could.

2284
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:04,700
Noel, it's hard to say this.

2285
02:42:04,700 --> 02:42:08,739
You've done so much for me, and I, well, I'm sorry.

2286
02:42:10,059 --> 02:42:13,299
Ridley, you're actually apologizing?

2287
02:42:13,299 --> 02:42:15,579
Thank you, I understand, you know.

2288
02:42:15,579 --> 02:42:19,420
You've always been nice to me when it's just the two of us.

2289
02:42:19,420 --> 02:42:22,100
Just wanted to make a happy world for me.

2290
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:24,700
I'm glad you realized it sucked.

2291
02:42:26,299 --> 02:42:28,000
Oh.

2292
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,260
Huh?

2293
02:42:29,299 --> 02:42:33,299
I mean, yes, I was, in a way, apologizing for that.

2294
02:42:33,299 --> 02:42:41,989
But I also wanted to apologize for leading you on.

2295
02:42:41,989 --> 02:42:44,790
I know you only always helped me out because, well,

2296
02:42:46,170 --> 02:42:47,809
you had a crush on me, so.

2297
02:42:48,889 --> 02:42:50,420
What?

2298
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:53,329
Oh, sorry, please don't be embarrassed.

2299
02:42:53,329 --> 02:42:55,889
It's understandable, but I have to tell you,

2300
02:42:55,889 --> 02:42:59,010
I really value your friendship, okay?

2301
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:04,979
So I felt I had to pretend to reciprocate those feelings.

2302
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:05,860
What?

2303
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:11,879
I don't, I never, no, the more I think that I may have

2304
02:43:11,879 --> 02:43:14,579
discovered someone else for me.

2305
02:43:14,579 --> 02:43:16,090
Huh?

2306
02:43:16,090 --> 02:43:18,799
Please don't be jealous.

2307
02:43:18,799 --> 02:43:20,489
Of?

2308
02:43:20,489 --> 02:43:21,329
Susie.

2309
02:43:22,370 --> 02:43:23,209
What?

2310
02:43:23,209 --> 02:43:24,370
What, what, what?

2311
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:27,329
Bart, what are you doing, Bart?

2312
02:43:32,639 --> 02:43:36,909
That was a bad homer, but I only had a second.

2313
02:43:36,909 --> 02:43:40,180
So that's why.

2314
02:43:40,180 --> 02:43:45,100
Geronimo.

2315
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:46,780
Hey, miss me?

2316
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:48,299
Of course not.

2317
02:43:49,139 --> 02:43:49,979
Yes, kidding, that was sarcasm.

2318
02:43:49,979 --> 02:43:51,399
I miss you.

2319
02:43:51,399 --> 02:43:56,440
Hey, we gotta work on your delivery.

2320
02:43:56,440 --> 02:44:00,600
Anyway, let's go.

2321
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:02,600
Everyone's together, but the wind blows coldly.

2322
02:44:02,600 --> 02:44:04,600
You are filled with a certain power.

2323
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:16,680
Why, you little.

2324
02:44:23,950 --> 02:44:26,750
Wear, wear wire strongly blocks the way.

2325
02:44:28,870 --> 02:44:32,409
Be tough, be sweet, let's be sweet.

2326
02:44:32,409 --> 02:44:34,049
And let's do that.

2327
02:44:34,049 --> 02:44:36,930
You and Rousey whispered sweetly to wear, wear wire,

2328
02:44:36,969 --> 02:44:39,850
pretending not to care, but acts became more effective.

2329
02:44:40,729 --> 02:44:41,569
Susie laughed.

2330
02:44:50,139 --> 02:44:52,260
It was like a lightning strike.

2331
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:57,379
Okay, now let's be tough.

2332
02:44:57,379 --> 02:44:59,899
You and Susie told wear, wear wire you'd beat them up.

2333
02:44:59,899 --> 02:45:02,340
The air crackles with fighting spirit.

2334
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,340
Rousey winks demurely.

2335
02:45:13,409 --> 02:45:14,250
How you doing?

2336
02:45:14,250 --> 02:45:15,090
Good?

2337
02:45:15,090 --> 02:45:18,340
No, not yet.

2338
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:20,780
Let's be cold.

2339
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:24,069
That's standard.

2340
02:45:24,069 --> 02:45:31,129
Let's spare.

2341
02:45:31,129 --> 02:45:32,899
You won.

2342
02:45:32,899 --> 02:45:34,979
All right, let's do the third floor.

2343
02:45:34,979 --> 02:45:38,110
Check here.

2344
02:45:38,989 --> 02:45:40,950
Whoa, this statue rocks.

2345
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:44,030
Hey, Rousey, can we take this from my room?

2346
02:45:45,870 --> 02:45:47,979
That would be stealing.

2347
02:45:47,979 --> 02:45:51,739
You stole the Susie-like statue.

2348
02:45:51,739 --> 02:45:53,700
There are all sorts of clothes inside.

2349
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:58,010
Oh, I've never seen Noel wear anything like this.

2350
02:45:58,010 --> 02:46:03,329
The search is isoreal cryptid.

2351
02:46:03,329 --> 02:46:05,690
It's a cross between ICE and something else.

2352
02:46:06,819 --> 02:46:09,139
Hey, Chris, take this for your room.

2353
02:46:09,139 --> 02:46:10,340
That would be stealing.

2354
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:14,420
You stole the ICE statue.

2355
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:15,500
Catalogs of search results.

2356
02:46:15,540 --> 02:46:21,569
Seems like most things couldn't be made into objects.

2357
02:46:21,569 --> 02:46:24,069
It's a bed, go to sleep?

2358
02:46:24,069 --> 02:46:25,469
Yes.

2359
02:46:25,469 --> 02:46:27,750
Chris, what if Noel came in here?

2360
02:46:27,750 --> 02:46:29,149
Yeah, what if she has tics?

2361
02:46:29,149 --> 02:46:33,190
Get out of there.

2362
02:46:33,190 --> 02:46:42,459
Wardrobe, it's a calendar.

2363
02:46:42,459 --> 02:46:43,860
Every page is the last month.

2364
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:53,459
Every day is the 25th.

2365
02:46:53,459 --> 02:46:54,299
What's this?

2366
02:47:16,139 --> 02:47:26,690
I'm gonna go up top.

2367
02:47:26,690 --> 02:47:28,209
Go to the trash zone, trash zone.

2368
02:47:28,209 --> 02:47:30,329
Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash.

2369
02:47:30,329 --> 02:47:33,010
Am I at the end of the game?

2370
02:47:33,010 --> 02:47:33,850
This is it?

2371
02:47:33,850 --> 02:47:37,350
I'm not gonna have an opportunity to go to the trash zone?

2372
02:47:37,350 --> 02:47:39,209
This is it?

2373
02:47:39,209 --> 02:47:40,049
You're at the end.

2374
02:47:40,930 --> 02:47:42,620
Am I gonna go to the trash zone?

2375
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:47,940
You're literally one step away from the end.

2376
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:49,739
I already did the Spampin' thing.

2377
02:47:49,739 --> 02:47:51,559
Is there something else there?

2378
02:47:51,559 --> 02:47:54,409
Did I already do that?

2379
02:47:54,409 --> 02:47:55,530
You don't have to?

2380
02:47:55,530 --> 02:47:57,250
You got a few hours left.

2381
02:47:57,250 --> 02:48:01,159
No, I don't think that's correct.

2382
02:48:01,159 --> 02:48:04,379
No, it's, can I do it afterwards?

2383
02:48:04,379 --> 02:48:07,059
There's something there.

2384
02:48:07,059 --> 02:48:08,500
Lore, lore.

2385
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:14,700
I'll go after her.

2386
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:23,200
There she is.

2387
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:26,020
Queen, stop right there.

2388
02:48:26,020 --> 02:48:28,579
Oh, my sweet idiot children.

2389
02:48:28,579 --> 02:48:31,979
You are just in time to witness my world domination.

2390
02:48:31,979 --> 02:48:33,420
With Noelle in my possession,

2391
02:48:33,420 --> 02:48:36,379
it is only a matter of time before her will turns

2392
02:48:36,379 --> 02:48:38,659
and she unleashes her power.

2393
02:48:38,659 --> 02:48:40,739
Blaketing the world in.

2394
02:48:40,739 --> 02:48:42,780
Too late, dumbass.

2395
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:45,139
Noelle's with Birdly.

2396
02:48:45,139 --> 02:48:48,180
Oh, and who is this?

2397
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:52,629
Birdly.

2398
02:48:52,629 --> 02:48:54,469
He's been intercepted.

2399
02:48:54,469 --> 02:48:57,850
My control plugs are now suitable for teenagers.

2400
02:48:57,850 --> 02:49:01,989
Now the whole family can enjoy eternal servitude.

2401
02:49:02,030 --> 02:49:05,389
What sort of regal, mostly cruel laughter?

2402
02:49:05,389 --> 02:49:07,420
Hee hee hee.

2403
02:49:07,420 --> 02:49:08,260
Wait there.

2404
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:10,190
Where's Noelle?

2405
02:49:10,190 --> 02:49:11,030
Ho ho ho ho ho ho.

2406
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:13,200
Ha ha ha ha.

2407
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:15,280
I wonder.

2408
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:17,479
I actually know the answer.

2409
02:49:17,479 --> 02:49:19,280
Enough already.

2410
02:49:19,280 --> 02:49:20,680
Oh dear.

2411
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:22,959
I do sincerely quite like you two.

2412
02:49:24,079 --> 02:49:27,120
It would be a shame for me to force you to serve me.

2413
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:32,100
An enjoyable shame.

2414
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:33,739
This is the end.

2415
02:49:33,739 --> 02:49:35,020
The queen blocks the way.

2416
02:49:36,040 --> 02:49:37,319
Queen defenseless.

2417
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:39,600
Throw.

2418
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:40,879
Group loosen.

2419
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:44,079
All right, we're gonna group loosen on Birdly.

2420
02:49:44,079 --> 02:49:46,680
Birdly's gonna get sentient again.

2421
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:47,600
Join the party.

2422
02:49:48,639 --> 02:49:51,969
This is a good song.

2423
02:49:51,969 --> 02:49:53,979
Everyone loosens Birdly.

2424
02:49:53,979 --> 02:49:55,739
Queen, think of the lighteners.

2425
02:49:55,739 --> 02:49:58,020
Aren't we supposed to make them happy?

2426
02:49:58,020 --> 02:50:01,899
That's not what I'm doing?

2427
02:50:01,899 --> 02:50:08,879
Ooh, I didn't know they were gonna move like that.

2428
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:09,719
Shit.

2429
02:50:09,719 --> 02:50:12,940
Fountain flows ominously.

2430
02:50:12,940 --> 02:50:14,219
Oh shit, I thought that was,

2431
02:50:14,299 --> 02:50:16,889
I thought that was her mouth.

2432
02:50:16,889 --> 02:50:18,209
I thought that was the big statue

2433
02:50:18,209 --> 02:50:19,450
and it actually was her

2434
02:50:19,450 --> 02:50:22,250
and that was her mouth opening and closing.

2435
02:50:22,250 --> 02:50:23,649
I thought she was like the biggest

2436
02:50:23,649 --> 02:50:27,629
to-stay-fuck marshmallow in there.

2437
02:50:27,629 --> 02:50:34,829
All right, throw, group loosen again.

2438
02:50:34,829 --> 02:50:37,489
No, I'm gonna throw.

2439
02:50:37,489 --> 02:50:39,270
Does that need to heal?

2440
02:50:39,270 --> 02:50:40,709
Oh, fuck.

2441
02:50:40,709 --> 02:50:48,510
We'll do it next time.

2442
02:50:48,510 --> 02:50:49,920
Bingo!

2443
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:52,000
I can't, my voice is fucked.

2444
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,799
I got too old, I can't do it anymore.

2445
02:50:53,799 --> 02:50:55,639
If I talk loudly,

2446
02:50:55,639 --> 02:51:01,819
if I yell loudly without screaming, that happens.

2447
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:11,309
I'm too old.

2448
02:51:11,309 --> 02:51:18,459
Queen's acid shield is formed.

2449
02:51:18,459 --> 02:51:21,469
All right, we're gonna do group toast.

2450
02:51:21,469 --> 02:51:23,030
All right, group toast.

2451
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:25,870
That glass of acid is generating her shield.

2452
02:51:25,870 --> 02:51:29,750
No, are you gonna drink all that?

2453
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:32,420
No, this is all mine, you can't have it.

2454
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:35,760
Queen sips from her acid.

2455
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:38,639
Each day they spend hours worshiping and glowing rapture.

2456
02:51:38,639 --> 02:51:48,780
Our screens are funny animals in Candied Game.

2457
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:50,260
Fucking 10 years of Binding of Isaac

2458
02:51:50,260 --> 02:51:54,319
prepared me for that one.

2459
02:51:54,319 --> 02:51:55,889
Group toast.

2460
02:51:55,889 --> 02:51:57,799
Toast to the queen.

2461
02:51:57,799 --> 02:52:00,059
Queen sips from her acid.

2462
02:52:00,059 --> 02:52:04,690
Oh, staring, tapping to receive joy.

2463
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:17,100
Staring, tapping to avoid pain.

2464
02:52:17,100 --> 02:52:18,379
Easy.

2465
02:52:18,379 --> 02:52:19,700
All right, acid shield is down.

2466
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:22,459
We're gonna do group loosen again.

2467
02:52:22,459 --> 02:52:24,469
What's he at?

2468
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:27,110
Recently when the town's internet disappeared.

2469
02:52:27,110 --> 02:52:32,899
Now the refuge they take in the screens will slowly fade.

2470
02:52:32,899 --> 02:52:40,600
I'll drink.

2471
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:41,600
Acid shield is there again.

2472
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:43,159
All right, I'll spare.

2473
02:52:43,159 --> 02:52:45,969
He's almost halfway.

2474
02:52:45,969 --> 02:52:50,389
I am going to dual heal.

2475
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:52,979
Yeah, let's do dual heal.

2476
02:52:52,979 --> 02:52:58,469
And then we're just gonna toast to the queen.

2477
02:52:58,469 --> 02:53:01,149
The soul shined its power on Rousey.

2478
02:53:01,149 --> 02:53:03,270
Susie made a toast to the queen.

2479
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:06,750
Pretty cool how we're gonna kick your ass.

2480
02:53:06,750 --> 02:53:09,260
It's a good thing I have no standards for this.

2481
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:13,639
Queen sips from her acid.

2482
02:53:13,639 --> 02:53:17,370
Rousey casts dual heal, there we go.

2483
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:19,489
Well, then who will help her?

2484
02:53:19,489 --> 02:53:22,569
For strange and sad searches, who will answer them?

2485
02:53:26,739 --> 02:53:31,280
Ooh, that's a weird one.

2486
02:53:31,280 --> 02:53:36,069
That's an interesting one.

2487
02:53:36,069 --> 02:53:39,790
Toast.

2488
02:53:39,790 --> 02:53:42,229
Is what I wondered until the night appeared

2489
02:53:42,229 --> 02:53:54,200
and created this wonderful world of darkness.

2490
02:53:54,200 --> 02:53:56,840
Smells like overclocked high heels.

2491
02:54:02,579 --> 02:54:09,659
Toast, come on.

2492
02:54:09,659 --> 02:54:24,139
Expand the dark world.

2493
02:54:24,139 --> 02:54:28,069
One more toast.

2494
02:54:28,069 --> 02:54:30,579
Here it goes, all right.

2495
02:54:30,579 --> 02:54:32,700
End the world covered in darkness.

2496
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:43,600
No one will have to suffer anymore.

2497
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:46,129
All right, let's go for it.

2498
02:54:46,129 --> 02:54:48,010
Group loosen again.

2499
02:54:48,010 --> 02:54:50,000
He's close.

2500
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:52,520
Everyone can live in my perfect mansion.

2501
02:54:52,520 --> 02:55:00,110
Every day blissfully worshiping me like we both deserve.

2502
02:55:00,110 --> 02:55:06,700
Drama.

2503
02:55:06,700 --> 02:55:08,659
All right, what are they at?

2504
02:55:08,659 --> 02:55:15,290
Birdly is almost there.

2505
02:55:15,290 --> 02:55:18,260
Red Buster.

2506
02:55:18,260 --> 02:55:20,979
No, throw.

2507
02:55:20,979 --> 02:55:27,149
Yeah, then we can do a group heal.

2508
02:55:27,149 --> 02:55:37,219
No, heal Chris.

2509
02:55:37,219 --> 02:55:54,110
Stop resisting and welcome the new age of darkness.

2510
02:55:54,110 --> 02:55:56,420
Red Buster.

2511
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:57,500
Is this gonna hurt?

2512
02:56:01,450 --> 02:56:03,049
I'm not gonna hurt her.

2513
02:56:03,049 --> 02:56:09,680
Let's try it.

2514
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:10,600
See what happens.

2515
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:12,520
Bowser made a toast to the queen.

2516
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:15,860
Toast to you, making me wear a butler outfit.

2517
02:56:15,860 --> 02:56:19,969
Bro, that's weird, but okay.

2518
02:56:19,969 --> 02:56:20,969
All right, Red Buster.

2519
02:56:20,969 --> 02:56:26,579
Ooh, all right, that took a lot down.

2520
02:56:26,579 --> 02:56:36,420
What did I say, I would do that?

2521
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:37,940
Oh, that's a weird pattern.

2522
02:56:37,940 --> 02:56:44,809
Okay, we're gonna go with...

2523
02:56:44,809 --> 02:56:46,690
I'm going to...

2524
02:56:46,690 --> 02:56:48,450
I need to do a group heal.

2525
02:56:48,450 --> 02:56:55,309
I need the TP.

2526
02:56:55,309 --> 02:56:58,700
Which is it?

2527
02:56:58,700 --> 02:56:59,540
Do I not have it?

2528
02:56:59,540 --> 02:57:00,379
Heal player?

2529
02:57:00,379 --> 02:57:02,020
I don't have a group heal?

2530
02:57:02,020 --> 02:57:06,379
Fuck.

2531
02:57:06,379 --> 02:57:09,790
Oh, wait a minute.

2532
02:57:09,790 --> 02:57:12,010
Shit, no, I don't have any more.

2533
02:57:12,010 --> 02:57:20,209
Revive's team.

2534
02:57:20,209 --> 02:57:21,850
Oh shit, I need 50 TP.

2535
02:57:21,850 --> 02:57:25,700
Dammit, all right, we're gonna defend.

2536
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:30,659
All right, he has to play.

2537
02:57:30,659 --> 02:57:31,620
No, what am I doing?

2538
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:33,180
Oops, okay.

2539
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:34,020
No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

2540
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:47,270
All right, I didn't want to spend all that.

2541
02:57:47,270 --> 02:57:48,670
Just don't get hit, bro.

2542
02:57:48,670 --> 02:57:54,719
Just don't get hit, bro.

2543
02:57:54,719 --> 02:57:56,920
All right, now we're gonna get the bird.

2544
02:57:56,920 --> 02:57:57,760
Let's go.

2545
02:57:57,760 --> 02:57:59,040
Enough, you foolish children.

2546
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:01,239
You may have survived my attacks regularly,

2547
02:58:01,239 --> 02:58:02,799
but I've been secretly, been secretly,

2548
02:58:02,799 --> 02:58:05,799
been downloading my ultimate move the whole time.

2549
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:19,049
Perish in the bosom of my hellish reign.

2550
02:58:19,049 --> 02:58:21,489
Ooh, that was close.

2551
02:58:21,489 --> 02:58:27,530
All right, let's get him.

2552
02:58:27,530 --> 02:58:28,690
This should be enough, right?

2553
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:30,860
Group loosen.

2554
02:58:30,860 --> 02:58:35,159
Oh, so that final move was supposed to be cooler,

2555
02:58:35,159 --> 02:58:46,260
but the internet is down.

2556
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:47,260
Sounds like overclocked high heals.

2557
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:51,879
All right, we need, what do I have?

2558
02:58:51,879 --> 02:58:54,649
Revive dust?

2559
02:58:54,649 --> 02:58:56,010
Revive's team.

2560
02:58:56,010 --> 02:59:04,870
Oh shit, will this work?

2561
02:59:04,870 --> 02:59:11,739
Can I revive him, like heal him?

2562
02:59:11,739 --> 02:59:13,059
What is he at right now?

2563
02:59:13,059 --> 02:59:28,670
All right, he's like there.

2564
02:59:28,709 --> 02:59:31,399
Okay, early wire is loose.

2565
02:59:31,399 --> 02:59:33,379
What, juice?

2566
02:59:33,379 --> 02:59:35,459
I think we got it.

2567
02:59:36,459 --> 02:59:38,020
Not bad, you foolish children.

2568
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:45,020
Hmm?

2569
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:46,260
What are you doing?

2570
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:48,620
Why isn't my control wire working?

2571
02:59:48,620 --> 02:59:50,979
Thanks to my comrades' kindness, their mercy.

2572
02:59:52,420 --> 02:59:55,340
Now, it's time for me to take my freedom.

2573
02:59:57,319 --> 03:00:01,200
Queen, you may have mastered the number three,

2574
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:05,610
but can you stand up against four of us?

2575
03:00:05,610 --> 03:00:08,639
Warning simulation for the number four.

2576
03:00:08,639 --> 03:00:12,639
Hmm, you are definitely going to kick my ass.

2577
03:00:12,639 --> 03:00:19,930
Unless, oh no, what that?

2578
03:00:19,930 --> 03:00:29,239
Wait, one nanosecond, you cowardette.

2579
03:00:29,239 --> 03:00:30,799
Glass.

2580
03:00:30,799 --> 03:00:31,639
Birdly?

2581
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:36,280
Ah, just now was nothing more than simple bravado.

2582
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:38,920
Truth is, that wire already absorbed

2583
03:00:38,920 --> 03:00:41,159
all of my succulent energy juices.

2584
03:00:44,629 --> 03:00:47,360
Birdly, hey, Birdly, are you okay?

2585
03:00:47,360 --> 03:00:53,100
Everything getting dark, only a kiss

2586
03:00:53,459 --> 03:00:56,500
from a beautiful gamer girl can save me now.

2587
03:00:59,129 --> 03:00:59,969
Birdly.

2588
03:01:03,079 --> 03:01:04,440
What?

2589
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:07,000
Like, you're like losing consciousness and stuff,

2590
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,610
but like, could you speak up?

2591
03:01:09,610 --> 03:01:13,579
Ah, sorry, suddenly I'm feeling a bit better.

2592
03:01:15,020 --> 03:01:16,469
Hey, that's a relief.

2593
03:01:19,409 --> 03:01:24,520
Well, gotta hurry and save Noel, so later.

2594
03:01:24,520 --> 03:01:28,850
Hey, Susan, so enigmatic in her ways.

2595
03:01:28,850 --> 03:01:32,629
But I can read her heart, Chris, like a health meter.

2596
03:01:32,629 --> 03:01:34,069
It's beeping for love.

2597
03:01:35,790 --> 03:01:38,579
Well enough tales, Chris, good luck.

2598
03:01:38,579 --> 03:01:45,540
May the smarts not be with you.

2599
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:54,659
Okay, Chris, your deep concern for me is dexterous.

2600
03:01:54,659 --> 03:01:58,909
Stay sanguine, my fellow blue bird.

2601
03:01:58,909 --> 03:02:09,209
I'll find some way to help you out.

2602
03:02:09,209 --> 03:02:10,370
If you're going to the trash zone,

2603
03:02:10,370 --> 03:02:17,620
this is the point of no return.

2604
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:23,110
If I go right one screen, you're saying?

2605
03:02:23,110 --> 03:02:24,270
Should I go all the way back left

2606
03:02:24,270 --> 03:02:29,139
or do I have like a shortcut here?

2607
03:02:29,139 --> 03:02:32,430
Fuck the lore, don't.

2608
03:02:32,430 --> 03:02:36,780
Trash zone is just don't go, don't, who cares?

2609
03:02:36,780 --> 03:02:42,579
It's not important, okay.

2610
03:02:42,579 --> 03:02:53,899
Oh, whatever.

2611
03:02:55,340 --> 03:03:00,340
Night, roaring night, day it deigned

2612
03:03:02,229 --> 03:03:06,579
to create this world, reaching its long hand to the sky.

2613
03:03:07,879 --> 03:03:10,569
It caused its will into its blade,

2614
03:03:11,709 --> 03:03:15,030
made rusting the fountain from the earth.

2615
03:03:18,690 --> 03:03:21,129
Unfortunately, the world they created

2616
03:03:21,129 --> 03:03:23,690
is trapped within the confines of the library.

2617
03:03:24,979 --> 03:03:27,819
If only we had a way to make more darkness,

2618
03:03:30,049 --> 03:03:32,209
we might be able to cover the whole world.

2619
03:03:37,020 --> 03:03:40,440
That is when I realized this power,

2620
03:03:40,440 --> 03:03:44,159
this power of the will, this power of determination.

2621
03:03:46,379 --> 03:03:49,020
Is this not something that all lighteners possess?

2622
03:03:50,459 --> 03:03:53,020
If one was simply determined enough,

2623
03:03:54,290 --> 03:03:57,010
would not anyone make a dark fountain?

2624
03:03:58,459 --> 03:04:02,899
So then, if the night has taken its leave,

2625
03:04:02,899 --> 03:04:10,579
then I will simply make a new one.

2626
03:04:10,579 --> 03:04:12,379
Well, honey, darling, sweetie gravy,

2627
03:04:13,219 --> 03:04:16,360
how do you find the giant hand?

2628
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:20,159
Great, but how do you feel about world domination?

2629
03:04:20,840 --> 03:04:26,549
Ooh, ouchie, mama.

2630
03:04:26,549 --> 03:04:29,219
Susie, you came to save me.

2631
03:04:29,219 --> 03:04:30,780
Somehow, I knew you would.

2632
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:32,780
You did?

2633
03:04:33,620 --> 03:04:39,120
I mean, I, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2634
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:41,680
You need to get out of here, hurry.

2635
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:48,219
Oh, she is giant.

2636
03:04:48,219 --> 03:04:49,139
Yeah, I knew it.

2637
03:04:51,969 --> 03:04:54,610
That was the statue I was thinking of, right?

2638
03:04:54,610 --> 03:04:56,329
I thought that portal was the mouth.

2639
03:04:56,329 --> 03:04:58,180
That's the real mouth.

2640
03:04:58,180 --> 03:05:01,100
Queen, seems that you failed to notice

2641
03:05:01,100 --> 03:05:06,110
a giant freaking robot in the middle of my palace.

2642
03:05:06,110 --> 03:05:09,110
This isn't good, she's invincible like this.

2643
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:10,680
Huh?

2644
03:05:10,680 --> 03:05:13,319
She's been bragging about her final form all day.

2645
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:19,120
Think growing a few inches is gonna help?

2646
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:21,100
Yes.

2647
03:05:25,340 --> 03:05:28,510
Are we cool to take over the world now?

2648
03:05:28,510 --> 03:05:29,750
Susie, let's just give up,

2649
03:05:29,750 --> 03:05:33,209
and hell if we're giving up now.

2650
03:05:33,209 --> 03:05:36,100
Susie, what if you got another form?

2651
03:05:36,100 --> 03:05:37,059
We've got one too.

2652
03:05:37,979 --> 03:05:42,780
Chris, Rousey, come on.

2653
03:05:42,780 --> 03:05:45,440
God, what are you guys doing?

2654
03:05:45,440 --> 03:05:47,479
This is our ultimate.

2655
03:05:47,479 --> 03:05:49,520
Wait a second, now that you mention it.

2656
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:52,540
Oh no, it appears I'm evenly matched.

2657
03:05:52,540 --> 03:05:59,989
I hope you won't mind if I don't hold back.

2658
03:05:59,989 --> 03:06:00,829
We're falling.

2659
03:06:02,270 --> 03:06:05,459
Any bright ideas on how we're gonna get out of this?

2660
03:06:05,459 --> 03:06:07,899
We could try flapping our arms.

2661
03:06:07,899 --> 03:06:12,780
Fear not, your knight in glow in the dark armor is here.

2662
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:15,940
Early?

2663
03:06:15,940 --> 03:06:18,579
Chris, Susie, my energy is still too low

2664
03:06:18,579 --> 03:06:21,739
to help you fight, so I found help for you.

2665
03:06:21,739 --> 03:06:26,620
Behold, comrades, on your quest against the queen,

2666
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:28,780
you've made all sorts of buddies, right?

2667
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:32,620
Using our junk-making skills, we modify everyone

2668
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:34,340
to work together.

2669
03:06:34,340 --> 03:06:37,350
I shall take credit for this.

2670
03:06:37,350 --> 03:06:40,649
The man of a million voices, five.

2671
03:06:40,649 --> 03:06:46,180
Chris, Susie, behold, the ultimate group project

2672
03:06:46,180 --> 03:06:49,069
with a splendid base.

2673
03:06:49,069 --> 03:06:51,069
My strongest JPEGs.

2674
03:06:51,069 --> 03:06:51,989
Oh wait, no.

2675
03:06:51,989 --> 03:06:55,239
My strongest JPEGs.

2676
03:06:55,239 --> 03:06:57,659
Flashing lights.

2677
03:06:57,659 --> 03:06:58,860
Happy bravery.

2678
03:07:02,920 --> 03:07:08,020
My energy.

2679
03:07:08,020 --> 03:07:10,430
Tender loving care.

2680
03:07:10,430 --> 03:07:12,700
Fresh cooking.

2681
03:07:12,700 --> 03:07:14,860
Organization.

2682
03:07:14,860 --> 03:07:34,510
And most of all, whatever's missing in.

2683
03:07:34,510 --> 03:07:37,100
Oh my goodness, what is going on now?

2684
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:41,860
Finally, a worthy opponent.

2685
03:07:41,860 --> 03:07:42,700
What?

2686
03:07:42,739 --> 03:07:44,180
Oh shit, here we go.

2687
03:07:44,180 --> 03:07:46,819
It's the fighting game.

2688
03:07:46,819 --> 03:07:50,360
Giga Queen blocks the way.

2689
03:07:50,360 --> 03:07:52,209
All right, Giga Queen.

2690
03:07:52,209 --> 03:07:54,329
Laser mode turbo dodge.

2691
03:07:54,329 --> 03:07:59,729
Self-fix.

2692
03:07:59,729 --> 03:08:03,030
Did I attack?

2693
03:08:03,030 --> 03:08:12,079
Or should I build TP and then do the other stuff?

2694
03:08:12,079 --> 03:08:17,959
Oh, time for the words is, the time for words is over.

2695
03:08:20,360 --> 03:08:21,959
Now is time to fight only.

2696
03:08:23,489 --> 03:08:26,790
Oh fuck, I didn't know we were doing this right now.

2697
03:08:26,790 --> 03:08:28,780
What are the buttons?

2698
03:08:28,780 --> 03:08:33,120
What are the buttons?

2699
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:35,000
Cityscape roars past.

2700
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:35,840
All right, Giga Queen.

2701
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:40,829
All right, let's go.

2702
03:08:40,829 --> 03:08:42,510
Just kidding, I totally will keep monologuing

2703
03:08:42,510 --> 03:08:55,340
as I kick at your face.

2704
03:08:55,340 --> 03:08:57,620
Nice.

2705
03:08:57,620 --> 03:09:00,979
The night is young for fighting.

2706
03:09:00,979 --> 03:09:02,819
Self-fix, how am I doing?

2707
03:09:02,819 --> 03:09:08,379
I think I got plenty of health.

2708
03:09:08,379 --> 03:09:12,579
Time has come for Noelle to realize her own strength.

2709
03:09:12,579 --> 03:09:20,260
Her own will, her own determination.

2710
03:09:20,260 --> 03:09:25,739
Fuckhead.

2711
03:09:25,739 --> 03:09:28,100
Rousey advises you to dodge then counterpunch.

2712
03:09:28,100 --> 03:09:34,639
What do you think I've been doing?

2713
03:09:34,639 --> 03:09:40,370
Uh-oh.

2714
03:09:40,370 --> 03:09:41,530
Focusing into her blade,

2715
03:09:41,569 --> 03:09:44,209
she will create a neo-dark fountain.

2716
03:09:44,209 --> 03:09:56,329
Then another, then another.

2717
03:09:56,329 --> 03:09:59,860
Oh wait, it's one, one, one, one, one.

2718
03:09:59,860 --> 03:10:06,479
Queen's attacks just got tougher.

2719
03:10:06,479 --> 03:10:08,239
Then when the whole world is covered in darkness,

2720
03:10:08,239 --> 03:10:10,000
she and everyone can live in bliss

2721
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:11,639
free of fear and suffering.

2722
03:10:20,209 --> 03:10:22,329
Okay, I gotta learn the fight.

2723
03:10:22,329 --> 03:10:27,030
Self-fix.

2724
03:10:27,030 --> 03:10:28,670
First Susie, why don't you help me to

2725
03:10:28,670 --> 03:10:42,829
create the world of your dreams and not of my dreams?

2726
03:10:42,829 --> 03:10:45,610
Susie, bro, just let me karate chop you

2727
03:10:45,610 --> 03:10:55,819
and you can have as many skateboards as you want.

2728
03:10:56,700 --> 03:11:01,350
Um, laser mode?

2729
03:11:01,350 --> 03:11:03,149
Laser mode.

2730
03:11:03,149 --> 03:11:06,750
Light quick aura fired up.

2731
03:11:06,750 --> 03:11:08,030
Oh shit.

2732
03:11:08,030 --> 03:11:11,690
And Chris, my dearest Trucy, you can have as many?

2733
03:11:11,690 --> 03:11:17,540
Hey, I don't remember what you liked.

2734
03:11:17,540 --> 03:11:22,379
Ah, phase three incoming.

2735
03:11:23,379 --> 03:11:25,260
Oh, it hurt.

2736
03:11:25,260 --> 03:11:33,139
Gotta heal.

2737
03:11:33,139 --> 03:11:34,100
Round three.

2738
03:11:34,100 --> 03:11:36,180
The attacks are extreme now.

2739
03:11:36,180 --> 03:11:38,059
All right, I need 30% TP.

2740
03:11:38,059 --> 03:11:42,680
Get it right here.

2741
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:46,629
Hey, was there a third guy?

2742
03:11:46,629 --> 03:11:51,139
Ah!

2743
03:11:51,139 --> 03:11:56,639
Oh, I go through the legs.

2744
03:11:56,639 --> 03:11:58,280
Shit, I need more turbo dodge.

2745
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:02,829
No.

2746
03:12:02,829 --> 03:12:05,069
Join me and all of you will become super strong and cool.

2747
03:12:05,069 --> 03:12:06,469
Meanwhile, I don't need to improve

2748
03:12:06,469 --> 03:12:07,510
because I'm already perfecting

2749
03:12:07,510 --> 03:12:15,889
to shoot lasers from my fancy glass.

2750
03:12:15,889 --> 03:12:17,739
Shit.

2751
03:12:17,739 --> 03:12:24,450
Shit, let me give me a chance to fucking hit ya.

2752
03:12:24,450 --> 03:12:25,530
I believe I've made my point.

2753
03:12:25,530 --> 03:12:27,770
I'm going to procedurally loop my dialogue now.

2754
03:12:27,770 --> 03:12:51,229
Here we go.

2755
03:12:51,229 --> 03:12:54,930
Whoa, that was a new move.

2756
03:12:54,930 --> 03:12:55,770
All right, turbo dodge?

2757
03:12:55,770 --> 03:12:56,690
No.

2758
03:12:56,690 --> 03:13:11,100
Again.

2759
03:13:11,100 --> 03:13:12,180
All right, now it's time to heal again.

2760
03:13:12,180 --> 03:13:13,540
No, yes, heal.

2761
03:13:13,540 --> 03:13:14,379
Heal!

2762
03:13:14,379 --> 03:13:22,500
Heal!

2763
03:13:22,500 --> 03:13:34,530
Hey!

2764
03:13:35,370 --> 03:13:37,649
You have truly proven yourself to be worthy of learning.

2765
03:13:37,649 --> 03:13:38,930
You have earned the right to remember

2766
03:13:38,930 --> 03:13:41,209
what your fighting machine's true purpose is.

2767
03:13:41,209 --> 03:13:44,209
To get your own ass thrashed by me.

2768
03:13:44,209 --> 03:13:45,889
That's my final attack.

2769
03:13:45,889 --> 03:13:55,219
Bye.

2770
03:13:55,219 --> 03:13:58,719
Shit.

2771
03:13:58,719 --> 03:14:02,510
What the fuck is an Omega Baseball?

2772
03:14:02,510 --> 03:14:10,739
I get it.

2773
03:14:10,739 --> 03:14:12,100
Battle power dropping.

2774
03:14:13,059 --> 03:14:16,430
Overheat activated.

2775
03:14:16,430 --> 03:14:17,909
Listen well.

2776
03:14:17,909 --> 03:14:19,750
You may have defeated me,

2777
03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:22,790
but I still possess one thing.

2778
03:14:22,909 --> 03:14:28,020
You three will never have.

2779
03:14:28,020 --> 03:14:33,200
Detachable hands.

2780
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:36,690
Was I supposed to punch that?

2781
03:14:36,690 --> 03:14:43,209
Did I lose?

2782
03:14:43,209 --> 03:14:54,420
Noel, honey, sweetie.

2783
03:14:54,420 --> 03:15:05,459
Gravy, take the pin I gave you

2784
03:15:05,459 --> 03:15:10,950
and stab the earth, creating our new supreme empire.

2785
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:13,540
I.

2786
03:15:14,700 --> 03:15:16,540
What's wrong, Noel?

2787
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:19,110
I know it would make you happy.

2788
03:15:19,110 --> 03:15:22,549
Or should I, with the last 1% of my battery,

2789
03:15:23,549 --> 03:15:31,780
push Susie into eight bits?

2790
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:34,530
Leave?

2791
03:15:34,530 --> 03:15:36,129
Leave Susie alone!

2792
03:15:36,129 --> 03:15:38,850
You think listening to you makes me happy?

2793
03:15:38,850 --> 03:15:41,770
No, I'll never be happy if I'm controlled by you.

2794
03:15:41,770 --> 03:15:46,340
Why can't you understand that?

2795
03:15:46,340 --> 03:15:47,620
That was acting class.

2796
03:15:47,620 --> 03:15:48,540
That was like, okay, if you have a room

2797
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:53,540
with like 100 people in an acting workshop,

2798
03:15:53,540 --> 03:15:55,219
that's like, that was like how I did it, you know,

2799
03:15:55,219 --> 03:15:58,260
in my acting classes.

2800
03:15:58,260 --> 03:16:03,030
Sometimes you just like, you blow out like the first workshop

2801
03:16:03,030 --> 03:16:04,829
and then like when you get the second assignment,

2802
03:16:04,829 --> 03:16:06,590
like you go nuts, you're a fucking lightning rod.

2803
03:16:07,430 --> 03:16:08,389
You act your ass off in the first like 20 minutes,

2804
03:16:08,389 --> 03:16:11,670
30 minutes of the class and you don't want to do anymore

2805
03:16:11,670 --> 03:16:15,549
and you're kind of just done.

2806
03:16:15,549 --> 03:16:23,110
I'm not gonna go like 100 miles per hour again.

2807
03:16:23,110 --> 03:16:25,750
Perhaps my computations were miscalibrated.

2808
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:36,989
Noel, disregard me and with your own power,

2809
03:16:36,989 --> 03:16:43,989
choose the world that makes you happy.

2810
03:16:43,989 --> 03:16:45,500
Queen?

2811
03:16:45,500 --> 03:16:46,899
Queen?

2812
03:16:46,899 --> 03:16:48,180
Queen, are you okay?

2813
03:16:49,549 --> 03:16:52,569
Seems she ran out of battery power.

2814
03:16:52,569 --> 03:16:59,819
Guess we can seal the fountain now, right?

2815
03:16:59,819 --> 03:17:02,180
Everybody?

2816
03:17:04,850 --> 03:17:09,260
Queen, she said, choose the world that makes you happy.

2817
03:17:09,260 --> 03:17:12,670
Don't want to live in a world ruled by her.

2818
03:17:12,670 --> 03:17:14,229
That wasn't the case.

2819
03:17:14,229 --> 03:17:19,719
Wonder if this world wouldn't be so bad.

2820
03:17:19,719 --> 03:17:26,209
Huh, Lucy, don't you think so too?

2821
03:17:26,209 --> 03:17:27,969
Oh, you mentioned it.

2822
03:17:27,969 --> 03:17:31,100
Chris, isn't this world just better?

2823
03:17:31,100 --> 03:17:34,950
You make so many friends here, you know?

2824
03:17:34,950 --> 03:17:37,610
I've never had an adventure like this before.

2825
03:17:37,610 --> 03:17:40,899
Axes and battles and magic.

2826
03:17:40,899 --> 03:17:44,299
Everything can be healed with a little spell

2827
03:17:44,299 --> 03:17:47,219
and no matter what happens, no one tells us what to do.

2828
03:17:48,750 --> 03:17:50,389
Gosh, yeah.

2829
03:17:50,389 --> 03:17:53,110
So even if things were really scary just now,

2830
03:17:53,110 --> 03:18:00,590
I mean, is there any reason not to?

2831
03:18:00,590 --> 03:18:01,870
Not that I can think of.

2832
03:18:02,750 --> 03:18:04,309
Me neither.

2833
03:18:04,309 --> 03:18:12,540
Then, Noel, let this be my real apology.

2834
03:18:12,540 --> 03:18:14,860
Concentrating my will into this blade,

2835
03:18:14,860 --> 03:18:19,420
I will make a new fountain and unleash a bright future.

2836
03:18:19,420 --> 03:18:22,059
A future that shines for us.

2837
03:18:22,059 --> 03:18:26,219
A future whose brightness is born from darkness.

2838
03:18:26,219 --> 03:18:29,979
Stop.

2839
03:18:29,979 --> 03:18:36,690
What in the world are you all doing?

2840
03:18:38,489 --> 03:18:39,329
Stop.

2841
03:18:40,209 --> 03:18:41,409
Stop.

2842
03:18:41,409 --> 03:18:45,020
You realize what will happen if you do that?

2843
03:18:45,020 --> 03:18:48,959
You'll just, you'll bring the roaring.

2844
03:18:57,100 --> 03:19:02,920
When the light is subsumed by shadow,

2845
03:19:02,920 --> 03:19:09,459
when the fountains fill the sky,

2846
03:19:09,459 --> 03:19:14,520
all will fall into chaos.

2847
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:16,649
I can do anything.

2848
03:19:16,649 --> 03:19:23,690
Titans will take form from the fountains

2849
03:19:23,809 --> 03:19:33,020
and envelop the land in devastation.

2850
03:19:33,020 --> 03:19:34,819
I had an opportunity to do that in Armand's voice

2851
03:19:34,819 --> 03:19:35,940
because it's like the Armand voice

2852
03:19:35,940 --> 03:19:37,180
I've been doing the whole game.

2853
03:19:37,180 --> 03:19:42,370
Surviving darkners crushed by the darkness

2854
03:19:42,370 --> 03:19:48,819
will slowly, one by one, turn into statues,

2855
03:19:48,819 --> 03:19:54,739
leaving the lighteners to fend for themselves,

2856
03:19:54,739 --> 03:19:59,510
lost eternally in an endless nightmare.

2857
03:19:59,510 --> 03:20:02,510
I thought it was gonna be a nightmare.

2858
03:20:02,510 --> 03:20:16,479
Is that your idea of paradise?

2859
03:20:17,440 --> 03:20:19,399
Oh, damn, I did not know that.

2860
03:20:21,389 --> 03:20:22,829
You didn't?

2861
03:20:22,829 --> 03:20:25,110
But your whole plan was to...

2862
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:28,549
I'm just a computer laughing my fucking ass off.

2863
03:20:28,549 --> 03:20:30,790
I didn't, I don't know everything.

2864
03:20:30,790 --> 03:20:34,020
I was just guessing based off the night's actions.

2865
03:20:34,020 --> 03:20:37,299
Why the heck, hell, would I want to end the world?

2866
03:20:38,739 --> 03:20:39,579
That's a relief.

2867
03:20:42,290 --> 03:20:44,489
Sorry, I, after everything,

2868
03:20:44,489 --> 03:20:48,030
I just caused trouble for you again, Noel.

2869
03:20:48,030 --> 03:20:49,989
That's okay, Birdly, I understand.

2870
03:20:49,989 --> 03:20:52,510
I thought about it while charging my battery.

2871
03:20:52,510 --> 03:20:55,920
You cannot calculate other people's feelings.

2872
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:58,500
You understand how I feel?

2873
03:20:58,500 --> 03:20:59,340
Not really.

2874
03:21:00,860 --> 03:21:03,889
I just don't want Noel to be sad.

2875
03:21:03,889 --> 03:21:07,639
Well, I'm glad you two kind of get it now.

2876
03:21:07,639 --> 03:21:10,239
Yes, we all made a pretty sweet team in the end.

2877
03:21:13,899 --> 03:21:16,860
I was just the judge in the acid.

2878
03:21:19,420 --> 03:21:20,700
No, we freaking didn't.

2879
03:21:21,700 --> 03:21:24,000
Can you let go of us now?

2880
03:21:25,479 --> 03:21:26,319
Oh, yeah.

2881
03:21:33,100 --> 03:21:33,940
Suzie?

2882
03:21:34,979 --> 03:21:37,180
Hey, you stood up to the queen, not half bad.

2883
03:21:38,340 --> 03:21:40,059
Really?

2884
03:21:40,940 --> 03:21:41,780
Yeah.

2885
03:21:42,940 --> 03:21:45,219
Just guess you gotta wake up soon, huh?

2886
03:21:46,139 --> 03:21:47,379
Huh?

2887
03:21:47,379 --> 03:21:50,879
Everything got so intense, I forgot it was a dream.

2888
03:21:50,879 --> 03:21:54,719
And I just hope I get to have more dreams like this.

2889
03:21:54,719 --> 03:21:58,309
Hey, Noel, when you wake up,

2890
03:21:58,309 --> 03:21:59,149
when you wake up,

2891
03:22:00,610 --> 03:22:01,969
well, I just wanted to say.

2892
03:22:07,100 --> 03:22:10,760
Well, then I suppose it is time for you all to exit.

2893
03:22:10,760 --> 03:22:12,959
Running program, tendergoodbye.exe.

2894
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:17,040
I will miss each and every one of you.

2895
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:19,159
Well, your unneeded honesty.

2896
03:22:19,159 --> 03:22:21,239
Suzie, your foolish bravery.

2897
03:22:21,239 --> 03:22:22,680
Chris, your chill vibes.

2898
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:27,620
Birdly.

2899
03:22:27,620 --> 03:22:29,899
Doesn't have to be goodbye, queen.

2900
03:22:29,899 --> 03:22:33,020
Chris can take you back to our castle town.

2901
03:22:33,020 --> 03:22:35,020
You and all our recruits can live there.

2902
03:22:35,670 --> 03:22:36,510
Oh.

2903
03:22:37,950 --> 03:22:39,510
Leading tendergoodbye.exe.

2904
03:22:41,879 --> 03:22:45,170
All right, time to do what we came here for.

2905
03:22:45,170 --> 03:22:47,889
Hey, Noel, if you see the real Suzie,

2906
03:22:47,889 --> 03:22:52,450
just know that maybe she's.

2907
03:22:52,450 --> 03:22:54,370
Look, she doesn't have a tail, okay?

2908
03:22:56,459 --> 03:22:57,299
Okay, got it.

2909
03:22:58,860 --> 03:23:02,110
Just go, Chris.

2910
03:23:02,110 --> 03:23:20,270
Everybody's laughing.

2911
03:23:20,270 --> 03:23:21,110
Chris.

2912
03:23:23,219 --> 03:23:25,540
Looks like we're here again.

2913
03:23:28,069 --> 03:23:29,149
Roaring night.

2914
03:23:32,399 --> 03:23:33,239
Whatever they are.

2915
03:23:34,280 --> 03:23:35,760
We're making these fountains.

2916
03:23:40,579 --> 03:23:46,750
But is that really a bad thing?

2917
03:23:46,750 --> 03:23:50,750
Since they started showing up,

2918
03:23:50,750 --> 03:23:58,979
everything's gotten a lot more interesting, hasn't it?

2919
03:23:58,979 --> 03:24:03,180
Well, we don't have to think about it that now.

2920
03:24:05,860 --> 03:24:06,780
I'm doing Obama?

2921
03:24:08,059 --> 03:24:10,250
I'm not trying to.

2922
03:24:10,250 --> 03:24:16,459
Chris, it's your turn.

2923
03:24:16,500 --> 03:24:19,739
It was as if your very soul was going.

2924
03:24:34,309 --> 03:24:41,700
Guitar riff.

2925
03:24:41,700 --> 03:24:42,540
Okay.

2926
03:24:44,180 --> 03:24:46,049
What happened?

2927
03:24:46,049 --> 03:24:47,690
Oh, it was a dream, wasn't it?

2928
03:24:49,209 --> 03:24:50,780
A dream?

2929
03:24:50,780 --> 03:24:53,350
That was all a dream?

2930
03:24:54,350 --> 03:24:57,110
Of course, that must have been a dream.

2931
03:24:57,110 --> 03:24:58,870
Such feelings, such thoughts.

2932
03:24:58,870 --> 03:25:02,020
Oh, sweet lady of justice.

2933
03:25:02,020 --> 03:25:05,610
You think I would ever think Suzie would be.

2934
03:25:05,610 --> 03:25:07,420
Suzie?

2935
03:25:07,420 --> 03:25:09,219
Suzie?

2936
03:25:09,219 --> 03:25:10,420
What are you doing here?

2937
03:25:13,180 --> 03:25:16,879
You invited us to study, remember?

2938
03:25:16,879 --> 03:25:17,719
Oh, right.

2939
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:21,120
What, studying with them?

2940
03:25:21,120 --> 03:25:22,239
Noelle?

2941
03:25:22,239 --> 03:25:26,000
Heavens to yikes, they're...

2942
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:30,500
Well, I guess we could try it.

2943
03:25:31,790 --> 03:25:33,840
My alarm.

2944
03:25:33,840 --> 03:25:37,659
I'm gonna be late for shift with Miss Boom.

2945
03:25:37,659 --> 03:25:39,420
Oh no, how is it that late already?

2946
03:25:40,719 --> 03:25:42,319
Well, adieu everyone.

2947
03:25:42,319 --> 03:25:45,649
I must gather my book longings.

2948
03:25:45,649 --> 03:25:49,479
How I love the texture of freshly picked up books.

2949
03:25:49,479 --> 03:25:57,430
Now, let us hasten, my dear Noelle.

2950
03:25:57,430 --> 03:26:02,100
Good day, Chris, Suzie.

2951
03:26:02,100 --> 03:26:03,100
Bye, Chris.

2952
03:26:03,100 --> 03:26:05,090
And bye, Suzie.

2953
03:26:06,649 --> 03:26:12,770
See ya.

2954
03:26:12,770 --> 03:26:15,409
What, what are you looking at for something?

2955
03:26:15,409 --> 03:26:19,760
Nothing, nothing, nothing, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

2956
03:26:19,760 --> 03:26:21,719
I think it's her problem anyway.

2957
03:26:21,719 --> 03:26:24,940
When you treat someone who just saved the world.

2958
03:26:24,940 --> 03:26:26,379
Look at me.

2959
03:26:26,379 --> 03:26:27,219
Chris.

2960
03:26:27,219 --> 03:26:29,059
Hey, wait a second, Chris.

2961
03:26:29,059 --> 03:26:31,889
We just actually saved the world, didn't we?

2962
03:26:33,370 --> 03:26:35,170
Damn, we really are heroes.

2963
03:26:35,170 --> 03:26:37,290
And no one even knows.

2964
03:26:37,290 --> 03:26:39,940
This is better that way though, right?

2965
03:26:39,940 --> 03:26:42,059
Freak out if they knew the world's in danger.

2966
03:26:43,620 --> 03:26:46,450
Well, it kind of sucks Noelle has to forget too.

2967
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:54,360
Whatever, let's get out of here.

2968
03:26:54,360 --> 03:26:55,399
The recycling bin.

2969
03:26:55,399 --> 03:26:57,000
Looks like someone accidentally printed off

2970
03:26:57,000 --> 03:27:02,620
a lot of useless emails.

2971
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:04,819
Full of many backup devices like extra mice,

2972
03:27:04,819 --> 03:27:09,280
extra keyboards, or extra maracas.

2973
03:27:09,280 --> 03:27:11,260
What's back here?

2974
03:27:11,260 --> 03:27:14,629
Closet is spacious and full of old electronics.

2975
03:27:14,629 --> 03:27:18,020
Large person could easily fit inside.

2976
03:27:18,020 --> 03:27:21,610
Computer, the monitor is flickering brightly.

2977
03:27:21,649 --> 03:27:22,850
The trash can, you get the feeling

2978
03:27:22,850 --> 03:27:24,489
it doesn't have any friends.

2979
03:27:24,489 --> 03:27:33,370
Hard to explain why you feel this way about a trash can.

2980
03:27:33,370 --> 03:27:46,370
Before you left, you gathered up everything in the room.

2981
03:27:46,370 --> 03:27:51,600
I love reading books, especially the books upstairs.

2982
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:54,870
I love reading, especially books.

2983
03:27:54,870 --> 03:28:04,260
I love reading books.

2984
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:06,479
Man, it got late, didn't it?

2985
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:09,120
Guess you should go home, huh?

2986
03:28:11,059 --> 03:28:14,870
All right, you don't have to say it.

2987
03:28:14,870 --> 03:28:16,790
Don't wanna walk home by yourself, huh?

2988
03:28:17,790 --> 03:28:19,870
Well, if you're gonna make me, I guess.

2989
03:28:20,829 --> 03:28:32,409
Let's go.

2990
03:28:32,489 --> 03:28:34,129
You're gonna make an apartment?

2991
03:28:34,129 --> 03:28:35,920
Nah, just here to hang out.

2992
03:28:35,920 --> 03:28:36,760
I see.

2993
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:40,979
I can actually go in all the way in here.

2994
03:28:42,489 --> 03:28:46,299
Silver, Drake, I've never beaten this boss before.

2995
03:28:46,299 --> 03:28:48,940
All right, hand it over, honey, I got this.

2996
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:50,739
No, Dad, this is my battle.

2997
03:28:50,739 --> 03:28:54,860
So, how about just telling me what to do?

2998
03:28:54,860 --> 03:28:57,979
Sure, how about trying fire shock?

2999
03:28:57,979 --> 03:29:00,629
I'd love to, Dad, but the mage left the party.

3000
03:29:00,629 --> 03:29:05,270
Oh yeah, how about one of your 99 blaze potions?

3001
03:29:05,270 --> 03:29:07,190
Oh, I'm saving those.

3002
03:29:07,190 --> 03:29:08,030
What, your birthday?

3003
03:29:08,030 --> 03:29:10,069
Come on, little, little.

3004
03:29:10,110 --> 03:29:11,430
Hey, Dad, this one's for you.

3005
03:29:11,430 --> 03:29:15,450
Hi-ya, it reflects fire attacks.

3006
03:29:17,049 --> 03:29:19,129
Oops, hey, you gotta heal.

3007
03:29:20,379 --> 03:29:23,850
I wish I knew healing magic in real life

3008
03:29:23,850 --> 03:29:24,850
that it'd make you better,

3009
03:29:24,850 --> 03:29:30,780
and it wouldn't just be me and Mom.

3010
03:29:30,780 --> 03:29:33,180
Your mother is, hey, it's okay, sweetheart,

3011
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:34,899
I'm getting better.

3012
03:29:34,899 --> 03:29:38,260
I might even be able to go to church tomorrow.

3013
03:29:38,260 --> 03:29:41,969
Really, are you sure you're okay?

3014
03:29:41,969 --> 03:29:44,940
Holidays happen whether you like it or not.

3015
03:29:44,940 --> 03:29:47,590
Even though everyone likes holidays?

3016
03:29:47,590 --> 03:29:52,040
Well, gotta go home soon or Mom will call.

3017
03:29:52,040 --> 03:29:53,239
See you tomorrow, honey.

3018
03:29:54,360 --> 03:29:56,680
Hi, Dad, love you.

3019
03:29:56,680 --> 03:29:59,180
Susie, what are you doing here?

3020
03:29:59,180 --> 03:30:02,379
All right, guys, this game's only one player.

3021
03:30:02,379 --> 03:30:04,540
Dad, this is Susie.

3022
03:30:04,540 --> 03:30:06,459
Oh, this is Susie.

3023
03:30:06,459 --> 03:30:08,659
Susie, and I heard a lot about you.

3024
03:30:08,659 --> 03:30:10,579
Dad, stop that.

3025
03:30:10,579 --> 03:30:12,180
You have?

3026
03:30:12,180 --> 03:30:16,889
Cool, think I have to go now.

3027
03:30:16,889 --> 03:30:17,729
Susie, huh?

3028
03:30:20,799 --> 03:30:23,620
Lay a finger on her and I'll kick your ass.

3029
03:30:23,620 --> 03:30:24,940
Huh?

3030
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:26,540
I'm just kidding.

3031
03:30:27,420 --> 03:30:36,950
Well, kind of kidding.

3032
03:30:36,950 --> 03:30:39,850
Hey, Chris, why are you checking the sink?

3033
03:30:39,850 --> 03:30:43,090
That's what I'm asking, sweetheart.

3034
03:30:43,090 --> 03:30:45,450
I don't know.

3035
03:30:45,450 --> 03:30:49,420
Sorry, I used up a lot of my energy just now.

3036
03:30:49,420 --> 03:30:52,420
Probably not gonna be very fun to talk to.

3037
03:30:52,420 --> 03:30:54,579
Thanks for visiting, though, Chris.

3038
03:30:54,579 --> 03:30:57,450
And you too, Susie.

3039
03:30:57,450 --> 03:30:58,809
Susie, current situation?

3040
03:30:58,809 --> 03:31:02,459
No, well, current situation?

3041
03:31:02,459 --> 03:31:04,700
Seems like I need some more tests.

3042
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:06,500
So just gotta wait it out.

3043
03:31:06,500 --> 03:31:09,459
They can't keep me down for too long, baby.

3044
03:31:09,459 --> 03:31:11,420
Sooner or later, I'm busting out of here.

3045
03:31:14,139 --> 03:31:20,790
Besides, your dad ain't much without his main man.

3046
03:31:20,790 --> 03:31:21,989
What does this say?

3047
03:31:21,989 --> 03:31:25,659
Is your name Rudolph Rudy Holliday?

3048
03:31:25,659 --> 03:31:39,389
Hey, Chris, you forgot my name or something?

3049
03:31:39,389 --> 03:31:44,750
Looks like she's resting her voice.

3050
03:31:44,750 --> 03:31:46,229
Look inside the cupboard.

3051
03:31:46,229 --> 03:31:48,829
Very small obligatory piano is hiding inside.

3052
03:31:52,270 --> 03:31:58,139
Okay.

3053
03:31:58,139 --> 03:31:59,940
Well, Chris, you can play the piano.

3054
03:32:05,129 --> 03:32:07,510
Whoops.

3055
03:32:07,510 --> 03:32:08,350
There's more?

3056
03:32:08,350 --> 03:32:09,190
Yeah.

3057
03:32:09,190 --> 03:32:16,110
Let's just see what else is here.

3058
03:32:16,950 --> 03:32:17,790
Susie.

3059
03:32:17,790 --> 03:32:20,340
Hey, Chris, she's a nice girl, huh?

3060
03:32:20,340 --> 03:32:21,299
The hell are you talking,

3061
03:32:21,299 --> 03:32:24,340
the hell are you taking her here for?

3062
03:32:24,340 --> 03:32:26,139
Why don't you take her to the movies?

3063
03:32:27,139 --> 03:32:30,950
Hey, yeah, the hell didn't we go to the movies, Chris?

3064
03:32:30,950 --> 03:32:33,510
Yeah, and take me too while you're at it.

3065
03:32:33,510 --> 03:32:35,260
Yeah, Chris, come on.

3066
03:32:35,260 --> 03:32:36,459
Kettle corn, Chris, big.

3067
03:32:36,459 --> 03:32:40,100
Don't skimp out.

3068
03:32:40,100 --> 03:32:40,940
What is it?

3069
03:32:40,940 --> 03:32:44,379
Crispus.

3070
03:32:44,379 --> 03:32:46,379
Look, Chris, can't say much, but,

3071
03:32:46,379 --> 03:32:48,700
well, might look like she has it all.

3072
03:32:48,700 --> 03:32:51,059
Her mother, mother, you know.

3073
03:32:51,059 --> 03:32:54,139
Love her, but she's tough on her.

3074
03:32:54,139 --> 03:32:56,979
Normally, I balance it all out.

3075
03:32:56,979 --> 03:32:59,620
I can't do much when I'm not there.

3076
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:00,860
I'm gonna get better.

3077
03:33:00,860 --> 03:33:12,610
I have to.

3078
03:33:12,610 --> 03:33:18,840
Bees of the toy march on.

3079
03:33:18,840 --> 03:33:22,319
Uh-oh, Alfie's, hell if I'm gonna go any further.

3080
03:33:22,319 --> 03:33:25,200
Already close enough to getting banned from school.

3081
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:28,360
Don't wanna be banned from outside of school, too.

3082
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:33,319
That's a thing, right?

3083
03:33:33,319 --> 03:33:35,200
Hi, Chris, getting your project done?

3084
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:40,760
Oh, my bike, it's, I had a little crash.

3085
03:33:40,760 --> 03:33:42,479
You see, there was this police officer

3086
03:33:42,479 --> 03:33:49,700
and it's complicated, how are you doing?

3087
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:52,659
Chris, it's no secret, the police in this town are,

3088
03:33:52,659 --> 03:33:53,940
how do I put this?

3089
03:33:53,940 --> 03:33:56,739
Just eye candy, I guess.

3090
03:33:56,739 --> 03:33:58,420
Wait, wait, wait, I came out wrong.

3091
03:33:58,420 --> 03:34:01,219
I mean, they're symbolic, they barely do anything.

3092
03:34:01,219 --> 03:34:05,459
It's because of the mayor, there isn't any crime.

3093
03:34:05,459 --> 03:34:08,059
Makes me wonder if she even needs the police

3094
03:34:08,059 --> 03:34:10,899
or if they're just getting in her way.

3095
03:34:10,899 --> 03:34:13,100
Sorry, I'm just saying what you already know.

3096
03:34:13,100 --> 03:34:17,530
After all, she's your neighbor, right?

3097
03:34:17,530 --> 03:34:19,000
Did you need something?

3098
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:20,920
What's cool?

3099
03:34:20,920 --> 03:34:23,440
How's your project going with Susie?

3100
03:34:23,440 --> 03:34:25,559
What, you went to the library together?

3101
03:34:25,559 --> 03:34:26,559
With Noelle and Birdley?

3102
03:34:26,559 --> 03:34:28,200
That's amazing, Chris.

3103
03:34:28,200 --> 03:34:31,000
And while you were there, this has nothing to do with me,

3104
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:34,479
but the Teen Zone seems to have some good anime reviews,

3105
03:34:34,479 --> 03:34:37,440
you know, I'm not sure if you and the gang were,

3106
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:40,040
I'd check that out as you studied the anime.

3107
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:42,479
Next time you go, you might want to casually bring that up

3108
03:34:42,479 --> 03:34:44,360
among your fellow teens.

3109
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:47,120
I know your dad liked Miu Miu 2, at least.

3110
03:34:47,159 --> 03:34:53,719
Again, nothing to do with me, yeah.

3111
03:34:53,719 --> 03:35:00,299
We're the infamous dog burglars, the Wet Nose Bandits.

3112
03:35:00,299 --> 03:35:02,139
We're getting ready to sneak into that big house

3113
03:35:02,139 --> 03:35:03,700
over the holidays.

3114
03:35:03,700 --> 03:35:06,979
We were attacked from the shadows by something merciless.

3115
03:35:06,979 --> 03:35:09,860
Fearing for our lives, we ran right into the office,

3116
03:35:09,860 --> 03:35:12,420
Undyne's warm, loving arms.

3117
03:35:12,420 --> 03:35:14,540
She suplexed us all into the snow

3118
03:35:14,540 --> 03:35:16,979
with our tails hanging in the air.

3119
03:35:16,979 --> 03:35:19,979
Now we're in jail, but at least we're alive.

3120
03:35:19,979 --> 03:35:22,219
Plus, that nice ghost keeps giving us

3121
03:35:22,379 --> 03:35:25,139
corporately low-calorie treats.

3122
03:35:25,139 --> 03:35:28,159
And we all howl holiday songs together.

3123
03:35:28,159 --> 03:35:31,069
Oh, oh, oh!

3124
03:35:31,069 --> 03:35:32,069
Did I say that key?

3125
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:35,639
Hey, get out of the road!

3126
03:35:35,639 --> 03:35:37,319
Oh, sorry, bad habit.

3127
03:35:37,319 --> 03:35:39,879
Anything I can help you with, punk?

3128
03:35:39,879 --> 03:35:41,540
Dark World.

3129
03:35:41,540 --> 03:35:45,180
Oh, a super dangerous alternate world in the library?

3130
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:47,780
More are appearing, people might fall inside.

3131
03:35:49,879 --> 03:35:53,040
Listen, punk, you seriously think I'm gonna believe that?

3132
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:54,840
Dark World.

3133
03:35:54,920 --> 03:35:56,079
Oh, seriously?

3134
03:36:08,670 --> 03:36:10,950
I love those guys, I hope they show up.

3135
03:36:10,950 --> 03:36:11,790
Hey, wait.

3136
03:36:13,229 --> 03:36:15,149
No, not again.

3137
03:36:15,149 --> 03:36:18,780
Looks like I gotta go recap to those criminals.

3138
03:36:18,780 --> 03:36:21,819
Hey, by the way, that yellow glasses lady,

3139
03:36:21,819 --> 03:36:24,379
she a teacher, she kinda had an accident earlier

3140
03:36:24,379 --> 03:36:26,100
with her bike.

3141
03:36:26,100 --> 03:36:28,860
Just wanted to make sure she was feeling better.

3142
03:36:28,860 --> 03:36:30,379
Give her this.

3143
03:36:30,379 --> 03:36:32,139
Got a heart-shaped box of candies that says,

3144
03:36:32,180 --> 03:36:33,020
Get Well Soon.

3145
03:36:34,020 --> 03:36:36,979
It has to, it has to your bike hastily scrawled

3146
03:36:36,979 --> 03:36:39,799
underneath the Get Well Soon.

3147
03:36:39,799 --> 03:36:42,639
Look, Get Well Soon's all the store had.

3148
03:36:42,639 --> 03:36:45,159
Open it and I'll arrest you, look.

3149
03:36:45,159 --> 03:36:46,600
I'll even put a note on it.

3150
03:36:46,600 --> 03:36:48,600
Now stop interrupting me, I gotta go.

3151
03:36:48,600 --> 03:36:50,500
Got the previously described box of candy

3152
03:36:50,500 --> 03:36:55,899
with a note on it.

3153
03:36:55,899 --> 03:36:58,059
Oh, jailbreak.

3154
03:36:58,059 --> 03:37:25,020
I'll solve the alarm.

3155
03:37:25,020 --> 03:37:28,389
I gotta go, wait no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3156
03:37:28,389 --> 03:37:29,549
I gotta get the candy, I gotta get the candy,

3157
03:37:29,549 --> 03:37:33,340
candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.

3158
03:37:33,340 --> 03:37:36,459
Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.

3159
03:37:37,299 --> 03:37:38,139
Do you have something for me?

3160
03:37:38,139 --> 03:37:41,909
Here.

3161
03:37:41,909 --> 03:37:44,469
Oh, Chris, what is that you're giving me?

3162
03:37:44,469 --> 03:37:47,129
A box of heart-shaped chocolates?

3163
03:37:47,129 --> 03:37:49,889
Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't accept that from you.

3164
03:37:49,889 --> 03:37:52,229
What, it's from the police?

3165
03:37:52,229 --> 03:37:57,229
You mean she's giving me this Get Well Soon gift to my bike?

3166
03:37:58,760 --> 03:38:00,079
There's a note on this that says,

3167
03:38:00,079 --> 03:38:03,120
open this and I'll arrest you, you little punk.

3168
03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:19,729
Chris, tell her I appreciate it.

3169
03:38:19,729 --> 03:38:21,090
Hey, Chris, shouldn't we check on Lancer?

3170
03:38:21,090 --> 03:38:28,920
You should be back in the school closet, right?

3171
03:38:28,920 --> 03:38:30,489
Sant!

3172
03:38:30,530 --> 03:38:32,739
Oh, oh!

3173
03:38:32,739 --> 03:38:38,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's up?

3174
03:38:38,790 --> 03:38:39,629
Occupation.

3175
03:38:40,629 --> 03:38:42,149
Hey, you the boss around here?

3176
03:38:43,270 --> 03:38:44,110
Oh, me?

3177
03:38:44,110 --> 03:38:46,870
I'm just the janitor.

3178
03:38:46,870 --> 03:38:48,629
And where's the cashier?

3179
03:38:48,629 --> 03:38:50,270
Hey, cashier?

3180
03:38:50,270 --> 03:38:51,809
We don't have one.

3181
03:38:53,629 --> 03:38:55,149
And who do we buy stuff from?

3182
03:38:56,709 --> 03:38:59,170
Hey, me.

3183
03:38:59,170 --> 03:39:01,760
And that makes you the cashier?

3184
03:39:01,760 --> 03:39:04,399
Nope, I'm the janitor.

3185
03:39:04,399 --> 03:39:05,479
I'm just filling in.

3186
03:39:06,319 --> 03:39:10,780
Are there any other employees?

3187
03:39:10,780 --> 03:39:12,989
Nope.

3188
03:39:12,989 --> 03:39:15,709
And why don't you hire somebody else?

3189
03:39:15,709 --> 03:39:18,549
Whoa, you think I can afford that on a janitor salary?

3190
03:39:18,549 --> 03:39:19,389
It's Bertie.

3191
03:39:19,389 --> 03:39:20,229
Hey, I'll let you talk.

3192
03:39:20,229 --> 03:39:21,709
It's Bertie Sanders.

3193
03:39:21,709 --> 03:39:27,319
New voice, I'm trying to remember what I did last time.

3194
03:39:27,319 --> 03:39:28,159
Hey, what's up?

3195
03:39:29,940 --> 03:39:33,780
Sorry, kid, the brother thing's gonna have to wait.

3196
03:39:33,780 --> 03:39:35,180
How long?

3197
03:39:35,180 --> 03:39:37,579
Maybe a day, maybe another two years.

3198
03:39:37,579 --> 03:39:41,540
Who's keeping track at this point?

3199
03:39:41,540 --> 03:39:44,860
Hey, what's up?

3200
03:39:45,659 --> 03:39:47,819
Welcome to the convenience store.

3201
03:39:47,819 --> 03:39:48,979
You wanna buy something?

3202
03:39:48,979 --> 03:39:51,790
Put it in the basket and bring it over here.

3203
03:39:51,790 --> 03:40:02,840
In case you didn't know what the store was.

3204
03:40:02,840 --> 03:40:05,770
Hey, hey, you forgot something?

3205
03:40:05,770 --> 03:40:09,020
Yes, I think I left my eggs on the counter.

3206
03:40:09,020 --> 03:40:12,469
Guess your memory's not what it's cracked up to be.

3207
03:40:12,469 --> 03:40:13,989
Hee hee hee.

3208
03:40:13,989 --> 03:40:17,540
There's really egg on my face now, is there not?

3209
03:40:17,540 --> 03:40:20,750
You're egg-scused.

3210
03:40:20,750 --> 03:40:24,139
Now it sounds as if you're egging me on.

3211
03:40:24,139 --> 03:40:28,149
Egg on or egg off, I expect a lot from you.

3212
03:40:28,149 --> 03:40:30,950
Well, I am exceptional, hee hee hee.

3213
03:40:30,950 --> 03:40:33,270
Don't forget me, you're Egg's husband.

3214
03:40:36,860 --> 03:40:37,860
Hello, Asgore.

3215
03:40:39,059 --> 03:40:41,139
Hurry, I didn't expect to see you here,

3216
03:40:41,139 --> 03:40:46,840
but I have some extra flowers and I was wondering if...

3217
03:40:46,840 --> 03:40:49,319
Oh, I was just about to go, actually.

3218
03:40:49,319 --> 03:40:51,440
Oh, sure.

3219
03:40:51,440 --> 03:40:53,440
Home is where the heart is, isn't it?

3220
03:40:55,790 --> 03:40:58,809
So when Asriel comes home...

3221
03:40:58,809 --> 03:41:01,170
Yes, we should all discuss that together soon.

3222
03:41:01,649 --> 03:41:05,040
Donkey, donkey, say hi to Chris for me.

3223
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:09,709
Of course, have a nice day.

3224
03:41:10,870 --> 03:41:13,629
You know what I want, bone man?

3225
03:41:13,629 --> 03:41:15,030
Uh, yep.

3226
03:41:15,030 --> 03:41:17,229
Free pickles.

3227
03:41:17,229 --> 03:41:19,239
Why, thank you.

3228
03:41:19,239 --> 03:41:24,200
Uh, can I ask, what kind of flowers do you think

3229
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:28,139
would make her remember how she felt before?

3230
03:41:28,139 --> 03:41:31,700
Uh, maybe you should talk to your plants about that one.

3231
03:41:31,700 --> 03:41:33,299
Uh, I tarnished it.

3232
03:41:33,299 --> 03:41:35,260
Why, what happened?

3233
03:41:36,059 --> 03:41:38,700
Ha ha, don't worry, they're the first ones I asked.

3234
03:41:39,540 --> 03:41:41,700
They said good listeners, you know, flowers.

3235
03:41:43,120 --> 03:41:45,239
Well, yeah, nothing like a captive audience.

3236
03:41:45,239 --> 03:41:47,950
Ha ha, he's changing.

3237
03:41:47,950 --> 03:41:50,309
Yes, ha ha, I keep them in glass.

3238
03:41:51,229 --> 03:41:52,229
He's turning into...

3239
03:41:52,229 --> 03:41:56,360
What's he turning into?

3240
03:41:56,360 --> 03:42:00,319
Yes, ha ha, he's turning into Barney Rubble.

3241
03:42:00,319 --> 03:42:03,600
Uh, that's the same shit happened last time in Undertale.

3242
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:04,879
Uh, like that movie.

3243
03:42:05,879 --> 03:42:08,079
Yes, yes, it's very similar to that movie.

3244
03:42:09,579 --> 03:42:10,979
Uh, well, have a good one.

3245
03:42:12,180 --> 03:42:13,180
I'm trying.

3246
03:42:17,790 --> 03:42:23,959
Hey Chris, um, nevermind.

3247
03:42:23,959 --> 03:42:26,159
Yeah, I'm the sicko that looks at all the milks

3248
03:42:26,159 --> 03:42:27,760
to find the best expiration date.

3249
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:32,290
You got something about it?

3250
03:42:32,290 --> 03:42:34,889
Sometimes the hoofed girl comes here,

3251
03:42:34,889 --> 03:42:37,090
opens the freezer door, then stands in front of it

3252
03:42:37,090 --> 03:42:38,290
lost in thought.

3253
03:42:38,290 --> 03:42:40,290
I guess she really likes the cold or waffles.

3254
03:42:46,010 --> 03:42:50,010
Okay, well that's cool.

3255
03:42:50,010 --> 03:42:52,569
Sands runs the convenience store.

3256
03:42:52,569 --> 03:42:54,139
Can I do that?

3257
03:42:54,139 --> 03:42:55,540
Loose eggs, one dollar.

3258
03:42:55,540 --> 03:43:00,610
It's too much responsibility for an egg.

3259
03:43:00,610 --> 03:43:03,450
What time is it?

3260
03:43:03,450 --> 03:43:12,930
All right, I told the tip of the hats guys

3261
03:43:12,930 --> 03:43:17,540
that I was gonna be around around six,

3262
03:43:17,540 --> 03:43:19,139
and we're at six o'clock right now,

3263
03:43:19,139 --> 03:43:32,870
so am I almost done?

3264
03:43:32,870 --> 03:43:34,270
School has a save point.

3265
03:43:34,270 --> 03:43:36,100
Save your game in the school.

3266
03:43:36,100 --> 03:43:38,899
There's like 15 minutes left.

3267
03:43:38,899 --> 03:43:40,899
Let me just reel.

3268
03:43:40,899 --> 03:43:42,500
I'm gonna go to BRB screen for a second

3269
03:43:42,500 --> 03:43:45,280
because I wanna see how long they're gonna go for.

3270
03:43:45,280 --> 03:43:48,559
See if I can go another 15 minutes or so.

3271
03:43:48,559 --> 03:43:49,760
Give me one second.

3272
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:51,159
I just wanna hit up...

3273
03:43:51,159 --> 03:44:01,020
I'll be right back, and I'm gonna pee too.

3274
03:47:17,520 --> 03:47:18,520
All righty.

3275
03:47:18,520 --> 03:47:21,600
I dropped a few messages to them.

3276
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:26,049
We're gonna go until, I guess maybe they...

3277
03:47:26,049 --> 03:47:30,500
until somebody says, hey, come on over.

3278
03:47:30,500 --> 03:47:31,899
I think we have probably another 10 to 15 minutes,

3279
03:47:31,899 --> 03:47:33,100
so let's do it.

3280
03:47:33,100 --> 03:47:45,159
I'm gonna keep this open so I don't miss a message though.

3281
03:47:45,159 --> 03:47:45,959
All right.

3282
03:47:45,959 --> 03:47:48,159
Keep that open.

3283
03:47:48,159 --> 03:47:49,559
There we are.

3284
03:47:49,559 --> 03:47:51,360
Okay, good.

3285
03:47:51,360 --> 03:47:55,000
Go back to the school to save your game.

3286
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:55,799
Okay.

3287
03:47:55,799 --> 03:47:59,840
You kids came out of the library, didn't you, studying?

3288
03:47:59,840 --> 03:48:01,040
How wonderful.

3289
03:48:01,040 --> 03:48:03,239
Personally, I hate libraries, but...

3290
03:48:03,239 --> 03:48:05,569
There's like 10 minutes left.

3291
03:48:05,569 --> 03:48:09,979
Yeah, I don't need to explore every single little thing.

3292
03:48:09,979 --> 03:48:11,379
If I wanna talk to every single citizen,

3293
03:48:11,379 --> 03:48:14,139
I can do that, like on my own time.

3294
03:48:14,139 --> 03:48:18,510
Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.

3295
03:48:18,510 --> 03:48:19,309
Everyone?

3296
03:48:19,309 --> 03:48:28,370
Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.

3297
03:48:28,370 --> 03:48:28,969
Knock, knock, knock.

3298
03:48:28,969 --> 03:48:30,370
Ooh, is that a human?

3299
03:48:30,370 --> 03:48:38,500
If humans are made of bones, where does skeletons come from?

3300
03:48:38,500 --> 03:48:39,899
All right, let's head to the school.

3301
03:48:39,899 --> 03:48:42,180
We'll complete it.

3302
03:48:42,180 --> 03:48:43,180
Somebody said you could have finished it

3303
03:48:43,180 --> 03:48:45,379
in the time that you've been gone?

3304
03:48:45,379 --> 03:48:47,780
Well, I wanted to tell them,

3305
03:48:47,780 --> 03:48:50,379
because we kind of said that around 6 o'clock.

3306
03:48:50,379 --> 03:48:53,079
I told them and see what they were up to.

3307
03:48:53,079 --> 03:48:55,520
I wanna make sure that I'm communicating, right?

3308
03:48:55,520 --> 03:48:58,520
Oh, hey, that's my trash from other people's houses.

3309
03:48:58,520 --> 03:48:59,719
Like, privacy much?

3310
03:48:59,719 --> 03:49:02,319
God, living with Azzie made you weird.

3311
03:49:06,340 --> 03:49:07,940
Like, a little Chrissy, you hear,

3312
03:49:07,940 --> 03:49:10,319
that guy at the pizza place.

3313
03:49:10,319 --> 03:49:11,120
God, what was his name?

3314
03:49:11,120 --> 03:49:13,079
Pizza Pants?

3315
03:49:13,079 --> 03:49:15,780
Already got, like, a super hot girlfriend.

3316
03:49:15,780 --> 03:49:16,379
What was her name?

3317
03:49:16,379 --> 03:49:19,979
Like, uh, pizza-rina?

3318
03:49:19,979 --> 03:49:23,399
Anyway, what did you, like, wanna talk?

3319
03:49:23,399 --> 03:49:26,940
Okay.

3320
03:49:26,940 --> 03:49:28,940
Chrissy, like, guess what?

3321
03:49:28,940 --> 03:49:31,739
Today, I, like, went to the beach to play with my uke,

3322
03:49:31,739 --> 03:49:34,909
and, like, guess who's already there?

3323
03:49:34,909 --> 03:49:38,309
That copycat playing the same song I wanted to play.

3324
03:49:38,309 --> 03:49:41,510
Oh, my God, cat on the beach, grody.

3325
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:44,709
Did she, like, get lost looking for the litter box?

3326
03:49:44,709 --> 03:49:47,709
So, like, I try to, like, play the same song, too,

3327
03:49:47,709 --> 03:49:50,709
to, like, you know, assert my ukulele dominance,

3328
03:49:50,709 --> 03:49:52,909
and we end up, ugh, get this,

3329
03:49:52,909 --> 03:49:55,510
playing the whole song together.

3330
03:49:55,510 --> 03:49:59,139
Like, oh, my God, who does this girl think she is?

3331
03:49:59,139 --> 03:50:02,340
She thinks she can just, like, harmonize with me?

3332
03:50:02,340 --> 03:50:06,950
Uh, I can't stand her.

3333
03:50:06,950 --> 03:50:09,149
Little Chrissy, come to visit me.

3334
03:50:09,149 --> 03:50:12,440
I'm a real alligator, aren't I?

3335
03:50:12,440 --> 03:50:13,840
Oh, my God, it's, like, so sweet

3336
03:50:13,840 --> 03:50:16,440
you have a nasty, dirty little friend.

3337
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:19,040
But, like, this is my polluted alleyway,

3338
03:50:19,040 --> 03:50:21,840
so, like, I think I might have to go to the mayor

3339
03:50:21,840 --> 03:50:25,420
and get a traffic sign that says, like, uh, no plus funds

3340
03:50:25,420 --> 03:50:27,899
because, like, okay.

3341
03:50:27,899 --> 03:50:29,100
What is that?

3342
03:50:29,100 --> 03:50:32,299
Hey, Chris, this free milk is amazing.

3343
03:50:32,299 --> 03:50:41,079
It just magically refreshes itself every night.

3344
03:50:41,079 --> 03:50:42,879
Hey, Chrissy, like, guess what?

3345
03:50:42,879 --> 03:50:51,270
Today, I, like, oh, wait, I already did this.

3346
03:50:51,270 --> 03:50:52,670
Okay, that's, all right, let's go.

3347
03:50:52,670 --> 03:50:54,270
I wanna explore!

3348
03:50:54,270 --> 03:50:57,110
All right, let's go to the school.

3349
03:50:57,110 --> 03:51:00,110
I'm gonna, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3350
03:51:00,110 --> 03:51:02,909
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3351
03:51:02,909 --> 03:51:06,959
Whose house is this?

3352
03:51:06,959 --> 03:51:12,299
It's down?

3353
03:51:12,299 --> 03:51:19,620
Where's the school?

3354
03:51:19,620 --> 03:51:23,110
The school!

3355
03:51:23,110 --> 03:51:24,620
Oh, it's the church.

3356
03:51:24,620 --> 03:51:26,020
Just a spot.

3357
03:51:26,020 --> 03:51:28,180
Nothing like admiring the great paint job

3358
03:51:28,180 --> 03:51:30,379
me and my bro did on our church.

3359
03:51:30,379 --> 03:51:34,840
Haul, no sense of direction.

3360
03:51:34,840 --> 03:51:36,639
Well, I mean, I haven't been here in a long time.

3361
03:51:36,639 --> 03:51:40,760
Graveyard?

3362
03:51:40,760 --> 03:51:48,239
One of my best ideas came from the dreams.

3363
03:51:48,239 --> 03:51:54,389
You can rest here if anyone asks your writing.

3364
03:51:54,389 --> 03:51:55,989
He's confused west with east again.

3365
03:51:55,989 --> 03:51:58,190
I feel like I could literally walk around here

3366
03:51:58,190 --> 03:51:59,389
for, like, an hour and a half

3367
03:51:59,389 --> 03:52:00,790
and just listen to every single thing.

3368
03:52:00,790 --> 03:52:01,989
And I'm probably gonna do that.

3369
03:52:01,989 --> 03:52:08,850
I'll do that, like, later tonight before I go to bed.

3370
03:52:08,850 --> 03:52:12,690
I do want to be, I don't want to just cut into their time.

3371
03:52:12,690 --> 03:52:15,299
I did tell them a certain time.

3372
03:52:15,299 --> 03:52:19,010
Let's go ahead and end the process here.

3373
03:52:19,010 --> 03:52:32,069
Go right, down and left, right at the library to finish.

3374
03:52:32,069 --> 03:52:37,760
School is not the end.

3375
03:52:37,760 --> 03:52:39,760
Yeah, I have the game saved, like, 10 minutes before this,

3376
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:42,420
so that's fine.

3377
03:52:42,420 --> 03:52:44,620
So this is, is the school ending game?

3378
03:52:44,620 --> 03:52:50,069
Just finish it?

3379
03:52:50,069 --> 03:52:51,069
End of the game is your, yeah.

3380
03:52:51,069 --> 03:52:51,870
I'll, I can walk around.

3381
03:52:51,870 --> 03:52:53,469
I'm gonna do this probably on my own time.

3382
03:52:53,469 --> 03:52:57,700
Just explore everything and talk to everybody.

3383
03:52:57,700 --> 03:53:01,379
We can finish the game.

3384
03:53:01,379 --> 03:53:04,059
So what, where's the houses?

3385
03:53:04,059 --> 03:53:05,659
The secrets after the school?

3386
03:53:05,659 --> 03:53:07,280
Yeah.

3387
03:53:07,280 --> 03:53:08,479
Oh, the school is a save point.

3388
03:53:08,479 --> 03:53:09,879
Ah, all right, but I want to, like,

3389
03:53:09,879 --> 03:53:11,479
I want to end the game, though.

3390
03:53:11,479 --> 03:53:20,340
Do school first.

3391
03:53:20,340 --> 03:53:25,790
Door is locked.

3392
03:53:25,790 --> 03:53:31,270
What the fuck?

3393
03:53:31,270 --> 03:53:33,069
No, wait, you made me go in the school.

3394
03:53:33,069 --> 03:53:35,469
You said there was a save point.

3395
03:53:35,469 --> 03:53:37,579
What the fuck?

3396
03:53:37,579 --> 03:53:43,200
So this is your castle town.

3397
03:53:43,200 --> 03:53:45,399
It's not bad.

3398
03:53:45,399 --> 03:53:49,000
Chris, Susie, on behalf of everyone, I oppressed.

3399
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:52,549
Thank you.

3400
03:53:52,549 --> 03:53:54,350
Oh, the save point in the town, okay.

3401
03:53:54,350 --> 03:53:57,620
I'm going to be your wacky roommate now.

3402
03:53:57,620 --> 03:53:58,219
I thought you guys were putting me

3403
03:53:58,219 --> 03:54:04,090
to, like, the next part of the game.

3404
03:54:04,090 --> 03:54:05,889
Chris, I bet you have a lot of people to talk to,

3405
03:54:05,889 --> 03:54:08,290
but you don't have to do everything at once.

3406
03:54:08,290 --> 03:54:09,889
Save and take a break.

3407
03:54:09,889 --> 03:54:13,930
I know, you're in chat right now.

3408
03:54:13,930 --> 03:54:18,899
Where's the save point, up here?

3409
03:54:18,899 --> 03:54:20,100
You thought about how you can't go back

3410
03:54:20,100 --> 03:54:21,299
to the cyber world anymore.

3411
03:54:21,299 --> 03:54:24,299
You considered this carefully.

3412
03:54:24,299 --> 03:54:25,500
Okay, there we go.

3413
03:54:25,500 --> 03:54:33,040
Now let's complete the game.

3414
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:35,059
Now let's go home.

3415
03:54:35,059 --> 03:54:36,459
Then I can come back here and walk around

3416
03:54:36,459 --> 03:54:39,049
and talk to everybody.

3417
03:54:39,049 --> 03:54:43,780
So now home is where from here?

3418
03:54:43,780 --> 03:54:56,649
Yeah, it's at the top of the town somewhere, right?

3419
03:54:56,649 --> 03:54:57,250
This is it here.

3420
03:54:57,250 --> 03:54:58,649
All right.

3421
03:54:58,649 --> 03:55:00,149
Chris, you going home?

3422
03:55:00,149 --> 03:55:01,329
Yep.

3423
03:55:01,329 --> 03:55:02,819
All right.

3424
03:55:02,819 --> 03:55:05,020
Then I guess it's goodbye for today.

3425
03:55:05,020 --> 03:55:06,219
See you tomorrow, Chris.

3426
03:55:06,219 --> 03:55:10,569
Chris, how was studying with your...

3427
03:55:10,569 --> 03:55:16,770
Why, Chris, is that your friend?

3428
03:55:16,770 --> 03:55:19,700
I did Spampton already, yeah.

3429
03:55:19,700 --> 03:55:21,700
Why don't you invite her inside?

3430
03:55:21,700 --> 03:55:23,700
Uh, I mean, I...

3431
03:55:23,700 --> 03:55:26,260
Chris, I should probably get going.

3432
03:55:26,260 --> 03:55:28,500
And I was going to bake a pie.

3433
03:55:28,500 --> 03:55:30,700
Did you want anything?

3434
03:55:30,700 --> 03:55:39,739
I guess I can come over for a bit.

3435
03:55:39,739 --> 03:55:47,010
Feel free to come in.

3436
03:55:47,209 --> 03:55:49,409
Oh, excuse me. I'm Chris's mother, Toriel.

3437
03:55:50,610 --> 03:55:53,040
Yes, ma'am, I remember.

3438
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:56,579
Oh, you do? And you are Suzy, are you not?

3439
03:55:56,579 --> 03:55:57,579
Oh, you...

3440
03:55:57,579 --> 03:56:00,700
You remember my name, too?

3441
03:56:00,700 --> 03:56:03,860
Of course. Miss Alfie is a good friend of mine.

3442
03:56:03,860 --> 03:56:06,659
She often talks about you.

3443
03:56:06,659 --> 03:56:07,860
Glad to hear it.

3444
03:56:07,860 --> 03:56:11,440
What the hell is Alfie saying about me?

3445
03:56:11,440 --> 03:56:14,139
Suzy, why don't you wash your hands over there?

3446
03:56:14,139 --> 03:56:17,139
Then we can make the pie together.

3447
03:56:17,139 --> 03:56:18,780
Make it together?

3448
03:56:18,780 --> 03:56:21,020
But I don't know how to.

3449
03:56:21,020 --> 03:56:23,250
Do not worry, I can teach you.

3450
03:56:23,250 --> 03:56:26,479
Okay.

3451
03:56:26,479 --> 03:56:28,479
Chris, Suzy seems like a nice girl.

3452
03:56:28,479 --> 03:56:30,280
I'm very happy you're friends with her.

3453
03:56:30,280 --> 03:56:35,979
But, Chris, I heard from Alfie about her behavior.

3454
03:56:35,979 --> 03:56:39,479
If by any chance she influences you...

3455
03:56:39,479 --> 03:56:43,190
Leave the chalk alone, alright?

3456
03:56:43,190 --> 03:56:46,540
Hands washed.

3457
03:56:46,540 --> 03:56:48,540
Wonderful. Now we can...

3458
03:56:48,540 --> 03:56:51,540
Oh, Chris, how about you show Suzy how to bake it?

3459
03:56:52,639 --> 03:56:54,639
Chris, you know how to make pie?

3460
03:56:54,639 --> 03:56:57,879
The hell have you made me any for? What dumbass?

3461
03:56:57,879 --> 03:57:01,079
You pie hoarding piece of...

3462
03:57:01,280 --> 03:57:03,280
I mean, excuse me, ma'am.

3463
03:57:03,280 --> 03:57:06,579
Suzy, you can just call me Toriel outside of school.

3464
03:57:06,579 --> 03:57:09,959
Oh, okay, sweet.

3465
03:57:09,959 --> 03:57:12,959
Uh, Chris, oh, you need to wash your hands too.

3466
03:57:12,959 --> 03:57:15,329
And I suppose I shall teach Suzy for now.

3467
03:57:15,329 --> 03:57:17,329
Suzy and I will start getting ready to make the pie.

3468
03:57:19,079 --> 03:57:20,079
Wait, what?

3469
03:57:20,079 --> 03:57:25,159
It's a TV.

3470
03:57:25,159 --> 03:57:30,049
They're making a pie.

3471
03:57:30,049 --> 03:57:32,049
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

3472
03:57:32,049 --> 03:57:34,049
She's sneaking sugar right out of the bag.

3473
03:57:35,350 --> 03:57:36,350
Suzy?

3474
03:57:36,350 --> 03:57:37,659
What?

3475
03:57:37,659 --> 03:57:39,829
My pie, my rules.

3476
03:57:39,829 --> 03:57:42,739
Got it.

3477
03:57:42,739 --> 03:57:43,739
I couldn't do that.

3478
03:57:43,940 --> 03:57:48,950
Is the bathroom sink?

3479
03:57:48,950 --> 03:57:49,950
Will you run the tap?

3480
03:57:49,950 --> 03:57:50,950
Yes.

3481
03:57:50,950 --> 03:57:53,540
It started to run.

3482
03:57:53,540 --> 03:57:55,540
It's making a lot of noise.

3483
03:57:55,540 --> 03:58:05,329
Oh, not this again.

3484
03:58:15,680 --> 03:58:19,010
Why does it keep doing this?

3485
03:58:19,010 --> 03:58:42,559
I mean, dude, there are way better ways to hide

3486
03:58:42,559 --> 03:58:44,559
you shitting in the bathroom, by the way.

3487
03:58:44,559 --> 03:58:58,379
Well, let us get the flour.

3488
03:58:58,379 --> 03:59:00,379
That's this, this bag.

3489
03:59:00,379 --> 03:59:02,379
And you just... oops.

3490
03:59:02,379 --> 03:59:06,010
Oh, Suzy, you have flour on your nose.

3491
03:59:06,010 --> 03:59:08,010
Oh, I meant to do that.

3492
03:59:08,209 --> 03:59:12,090
I thought you would stop to smell the flour, eh?

3493
03:59:16,090 --> 03:59:17,389
Come on.

3494
03:59:17,389 --> 03:59:22,059
Now, on to the next part.

3495
03:59:22,059 --> 03:59:25,059
Where the... where the heck is Chris?

3496
03:59:25,059 --> 03:59:28,750
Oh, Chris does this sometimes.

3497
03:59:28,750 --> 03:59:30,379
Well, they should hurry.

3498
03:59:30,379 --> 03:59:31,379
I'm getting sleepy.

3499
03:59:31,379 --> 03:59:35,319
You know what they call a sleeping Suzy?

3500
03:59:35,319 --> 03:59:37,750
Uh, what?

3501
03:59:37,750 --> 03:59:41,620
They would call her a snoozy.

3502
03:59:41,620 --> 03:59:42,620
Uh, haha.

3503
03:59:42,819 --> 03:59:47,059
Then... and I guess you'd be, uh, Snoriel.

3504
03:59:47,059 --> 03:59:49,739
Hahaha, Snoriel!

3505
03:59:49,739 --> 03:59:51,739
Snoozy and Snoriel!

3506
03:59:51,739 --> 03:59:55,739
Uh, yeah, you really liked that one, huh?

3507
03:59:55,739 --> 04:00:01,500
Wasn't it funny?

3508
04:00:01,500 --> 04:00:04,899
Alright, where the hell is Chris?

3509
04:00:04,899 --> 04:00:05,899
Pie is nearly done.

3510
04:00:05,899 --> 04:00:07,200
Oh, the sugar.

3511
04:00:07,200 --> 04:00:08,200
Wait, here a moment.

3512
04:00:08,200 --> 04:00:09,200
I left it in the car.

3513
04:00:09,200 --> 04:00:10,200
Okay.

3514
04:00:10,200 --> 04:00:34,030
What?

3515
04:00:34,030 --> 04:00:40,879
Does it get the heart?

3516
04:00:40,879 --> 04:00:44,780
Okay, this is some, like, this is some weird shit.

3517
04:00:44,780 --> 04:00:46,780
He's taking the heart out and he's, like, killing people

3518
04:00:46,780 --> 04:00:47,780
in town or something.

3519
04:00:47,979 --> 04:00:50,219
He takes the heart out and he just does some weird shit

3520
04:00:50,219 --> 04:00:51,219
outside.

3521
04:00:51,219 --> 04:00:52,219
What is he doing?

3522
04:00:52,219 --> 04:00:53,219
Why does he keep doing that?

3523
04:00:53,219 --> 04:01:13,059
Hey, Chris, hurry up next time.

3524
04:01:13,059 --> 04:01:29,750
We're already almost done.

3525
04:01:29,750 --> 04:01:30,750
What's next?

3526
04:01:30,750 --> 04:01:32,700
Is they?

3527
04:01:32,700 --> 04:01:34,700
Oh, they go by they them.

3528
04:01:34,700 --> 04:01:39,709
Okay.

3529
04:01:39,709 --> 04:01:41,709
We already worked quite hard, have we not?

3530
04:01:41,709 --> 04:01:43,709
How about we finish it later?

3531
04:01:43,709 --> 04:01:50,049
How about we finish it?

3532
04:01:50,049 --> 04:01:53,120
Uh, okay.

3533
04:01:53,120 --> 04:01:57,090
Then I guess I'll walk home.

3534
04:01:57,090 --> 04:01:59,090
Oh, no, there's no need to do that.

3535
04:01:59,090 --> 04:02:01,969
Oh, actually.

3536
04:02:02,170 --> 04:02:04,659
Susie, would you like to stay over?

3537
04:02:04,659 --> 04:02:05,659
Huh?

3538
04:02:05,659 --> 04:02:09,479
I mean, um, if it's okay, then

3539
04:02:09,479 --> 04:02:11,479
here come the chimpanzees.

3540
04:02:11,479 --> 04:02:19,159
Here comes the chimpanzee.

3541
04:02:19,159 --> 04:02:21,159
Everyone's, why, what's going on?

3542
04:02:21,159 --> 04:02:29,389
I have to, every, every character that I control

3543
04:02:29,389 --> 04:02:31,760
is always just becomes, like, me

3544
04:02:31,760 --> 04:02:32,760
in a way.

3545
04:02:32,760 --> 04:02:34,760
As I'm walking around.

3546
04:02:34,760 --> 04:02:36,760
I tend to just say he

3547
04:02:36,760 --> 04:02:38,760
because I put it as me, essentially.

3548
04:02:38,760 --> 04:02:40,760
That's kind of how it works for me.

3549
04:02:40,760 --> 04:02:44,090
Yeah, that's fine, that's cool.

3550
04:02:44,290 --> 04:02:47,940
It always kind of becomes like an extension of me.

3551
04:02:47,940 --> 04:02:49,940
Like, walking around in a circle.

3552
04:02:49,940 --> 04:02:51,430
If that makes any sense.

3553
04:02:51,430 --> 04:02:58,579
Oh, hey, look at this!

3554
04:02:58,579 --> 04:03:00,579
Our couch is used to being used as a bed.

3555
04:03:00,579 --> 04:03:05,379
It's not perfect, but we could all sleep out here.

3556
04:03:05,379 --> 04:03:08,459
We could all sleep out here?

3557
04:03:08,459 --> 04:03:10,459
That sounds too, oh, get the sleeping bag!

3558
04:03:10,459 --> 04:03:13,079
Splendid, I'll make sure everything's in order.

3559
04:03:13,079 --> 04:03:18,069
So why do I keep ripping my heart out

3560
04:03:18,069 --> 04:03:20,069
and attacking people or something?

3561
04:03:20,069 --> 04:03:23,020
Just call your parents, will you not?

3562
04:03:23,020 --> 04:03:32,680
Yeah, of course.

3563
04:03:32,680 --> 04:03:34,680
So, what the hell, what the hell, a sleepover?

3564
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:36,920
I haven't had one of those in forever.

3565
04:03:37,120 --> 04:03:41,600
We're gonna watch every single episode of Rugrats.

3566
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:43,600
All of them.

3567
04:03:43,600 --> 04:03:46,219
It's not like someone has to tell you to sit, right?

3568
04:03:46,219 --> 04:03:49,549
Here, chill out for a sec.

3569
04:03:49,549 --> 04:03:53,649
So now what?

3570
04:03:53,649 --> 04:03:57,790
I got it.

3571
04:03:57,790 --> 04:03:59,790
Maybe between the pillows here.

3572
04:03:59,790 --> 04:04:05,229
Here, I knew I'd find the boat in there.

3573
04:04:05,229 --> 04:04:07,229
You can always find good stuff wedged in the couch.

3574
04:04:07,229 --> 04:04:11,200
Geez, it's dusty.

3575
04:04:11,200 --> 04:04:13,500
When did you last use this thing?

3576
04:04:13,500 --> 04:04:15,500
Well, who cares, it's just watch TV.

3577
04:04:15,500 --> 04:04:18,700
So, what are we gonna marathon tonight?

3578
04:04:18,700 --> 04:04:21,010
Blood Crushers 3, Hellbusters,

3579
04:04:21,209 --> 04:04:23,209
Invasion of the Catpetters.

3580
04:04:23,209 --> 04:04:28,299
Maybe Icee, the movie's more your speed, huh, Chris?

3581
04:04:28,299 --> 04:04:30,540
Ha ha ha ha!

3582
04:04:30,540 --> 04:04:34,190
What a good day, huh, Chris?

3583
04:04:34,190 --> 04:04:36,500
You, Rousey, Lancer, everyone.

3584
04:04:36,500 --> 04:04:39,250
It's cool hanging out together.

3585
04:04:39,250 --> 04:04:43,219
That's why, you know, don't you think we should

3586
04:04:43,219 --> 04:04:45,219
try to have them come to our world?

3587
04:04:45,219 --> 04:04:47,219
Come on, think about how much better it would be.

3588
04:04:47,219 --> 04:04:50,100
Lancer could do our homework,

3589
04:04:50,100 --> 04:04:52,100
Lancer could live under your bed.

3590
04:04:52,100 --> 04:04:54,459
We could all walk to school together.

3591
04:04:54,459 --> 04:04:56,459
Perfect, you know?

3592
04:04:56,459 --> 04:04:58,829
Maybe we'd be unstoppable, is what I'm saying.

3593
04:04:59,030 --> 04:05:04,219
Um, I don't know.

3594
04:05:04,219 --> 04:05:07,479
That seems, doesn't that seem,

3595
04:05:07,479 --> 04:05:11,579
isn't it like a different world?

3596
04:05:11,579 --> 04:05:13,579
I feel like that's like a, it'd be hard to do that.

3597
04:05:13,579 --> 04:05:23,930
We could try.

3598
04:05:23,930 --> 04:05:25,930
That seems, I don't know, that seems a little far-fetched.

3599
04:05:25,930 --> 04:05:27,930
What? Come on, it'd be easy.

3600
04:05:27,930 --> 04:05:29,930
Rousey looks like your mom, right?

3601
04:05:29,930 --> 04:05:31,930
Just say he's a long-lost cousin, it'd be easy.

3602
04:05:31,930 --> 04:05:35,170
Lancer could even make him a fake mustache.

3603
04:05:35,170 --> 04:05:37,409
Oh, whatever, let's just get back to watching.

3604
04:05:37,409 --> 04:05:45,469
Well, the festival's coming up, right?

3605
04:05:45,469 --> 04:05:47,469
The thing where the town becomes a carnival?

3606
04:05:47,670 --> 04:05:49,670
Stupid, right?

3607
04:05:49,670 --> 04:05:54,790
Say you had to take someone.

3608
04:05:54,790 --> 04:05:56,790
Noelle or Rousey.

3609
04:05:56,790 --> 04:05:58,790
I would probably take,

3610
04:05:58,790 --> 04:06:03,909
I honestly would probably go with Rousey.

3611
04:06:03,909 --> 04:06:05,909
Like you and Noelle could,

3612
04:06:05,909 --> 04:06:09,049
you could do that, right?

3613
04:06:09,049 --> 04:06:11,049
I'll take Rousey.

3614
04:06:11,049 --> 04:06:13,049
Why are you saying it's so confused?

3615
04:06:13,049 --> 04:06:15,420
It's not like I meant anything weird.

3616
04:06:15,420 --> 04:06:17,420
You know what? Forget it.

3617
04:06:17,420 --> 04:06:19,420
Well, no, I'm just saying like you and Noelle

3618
04:06:19,420 --> 04:06:21,420
can go, will go, like,

3619
04:06:21,420 --> 04:06:23,420
you and Noelle,

3620
04:06:23,620 --> 04:06:25,620
can go, will go, like,

3621
04:06:25,620 --> 04:06:29,780
we'll just go, why can't we just go together?

3622
04:06:29,780 --> 04:06:32,659
Now this is what I'm talking about.

3623
04:06:32,659 --> 04:06:35,020
Giant monster movie special.

3624
04:06:35,020 --> 04:06:37,020
I always like the better than the giant human movies.

3625
04:06:37,020 --> 04:06:39,020
Now this is something we can marathon.

3626
04:06:39,020 --> 04:06:41,459
Are you ready, Chris?

3627
04:06:41,459 --> 04:06:43,459
12 hours of building-bashing, car-crunching action

3628
04:06:43,459 --> 04:06:45,459
because we are locked in, got it?

3629
04:06:45,459 --> 04:06:47,459
Better not see you move until your eyes bloodshot.

3630
04:06:50,020 --> 04:06:52,020
Now let me just get comfortable here.

3631
04:06:52,020 --> 04:07:04,610
Zuzi fell asleep.

3632
04:07:04,610 --> 04:07:07,100
Already? That tends to happen though, it really does.

3633
04:07:07,299 --> 04:07:13,190
What is going on? Why does this keep happening?

3634
04:07:13,190 --> 04:07:17,739
Oh, I thought

3635
04:07:17,739 --> 04:07:19,739
the heart was going to come out again.

3636
04:07:19,739 --> 04:07:23,239
Officer, officer.

3637
04:07:23,239 --> 04:07:30,409
Thank goodness, I finally got through.

3638
04:07:30,409 --> 04:07:32,409
I thought I saw someone

3639
04:07:32,409 --> 04:07:34,409
prowling around outside.

3640
04:07:34,409 --> 04:07:36,409
And when I checked our car,

3641
04:07:36,409 --> 04:07:38,409
the tires looked like they'd been slashed.

3642
04:07:38,409 --> 04:07:40,649
Officer, if you could please come over.

3643
04:07:40,649 --> 04:07:50,819
You will soon, thank you.

3644
04:07:50,819 --> 04:08:05,719
They're already asleep.

3645
04:08:05,719 --> 04:08:10,969
It's not going to happen again, right?

3646
04:08:10,969 --> 04:08:25,610
Maybe it will? Oh god.

3647
04:08:25,809 --> 04:09:01,059
It is again. Oh god.

3648
04:09:01,059 --> 04:09:05,020
Oh, you're making the fountains.

3649
04:09:05,020 --> 04:09:16,159
You're making the fountains.

3650
04:09:16,159 --> 04:09:22,610
You're making fountains.

3651
04:09:22,610 --> 04:09:28,299
Why? Chris is the knight.

3652
04:09:28,299 --> 04:09:33,280
Are we going to get the

3653
04:09:33,280 --> 04:09:35,280
hahahaha

3654
04:09:35,280 --> 04:09:41,790
Come on, do it.

3655
04:09:41,790 --> 04:09:50,420
Well, shit.

3656
04:09:50,420 --> 04:09:54,000
What's going on? This feels weird.

3657
04:09:54,000 --> 04:09:57,969
Oh, I thought it was crashing.

3658
04:09:57,969 --> 04:10:06,670
I thought it was a skipping CD.

3659
04:10:06,670 --> 04:10:16,459
Alright, that was cool. That was good.

3660
04:10:16,459 --> 04:10:23,379
You want me to give it a rating?

3661
04:10:29,020 --> 04:10:31,020
Give it a rating. Alright, I'm going to give that one A.

3662
04:10:32,020 --> 04:10:34,020
I refuse to rate it until the whole thing's up.

3663
04:10:34,020 --> 04:10:42,319
There you go. Number three.

3664
04:10:42,319 --> 04:10:45,389
That was very good though. That was really fun.

3665
04:10:45,389 --> 04:10:47,389
That was exactly what I thought

3666
04:10:47,389 --> 04:10:50,979
it was going to be. Exactly what I expected.

3667
04:10:50,979 --> 04:10:52,979
The weird part about this is I'm surprised.

3668
04:10:52,979 --> 04:10:54,979
This is going to be seven chapters.

3669
04:10:54,979 --> 04:11:00,100
That seems like a lot.

3670
04:11:00,100 --> 04:11:02,100
That seems like a lot more

3671
04:11:02,100 --> 04:11:04,979
to do. Seven.

3672
04:11:04,979 --> 04:11:10,350
See, when you're 50.

3673
04:11:10,350 --> 04:11:17,389
Toby said three to five

3674
04:11:17,389 --> 04:11:19,389
chapters coming out around the same time.

3675
04:11:19,389 --> 04:11:22,659
You know, that would make sense.

3676
04:11:22,659 --> 04:11:24,959
There's another route for

3677
04:11:24,959 --> 04:11:26,959
three, four, five in the same release.

3678
04:11:26,959 --> 04:11:28,959
This is no longer free anymore, right?

3679
04:11:28,959 --> 04:11:30,959
Chapters three, four, and five are a paid thing.

3680
04:11:30,959 --> 04:11:32,959
So they're going to be one

3681
04:11:32,959 --> 04:11:37,760
thing that's paid, right?

3682
04:11:37,760 --> 04:11:40,379
Look, being able to actually

3683
04:11:40,379 --> 04:11:42,379
just check it out, because this is called the demo.

3684
04:11:42,379 --> 04:11:44,379
You get the first two chapters for free and then if you want to

3685
04:11:44,379 --> 04:11:46,379
pay for it and you like it, you can just keep going.

3686
04:11:46,379 --> 04:11:53,260
That's cool.

3687
04:11:53,260 --> 04:11:55,569
That's really cool.

3688
04:11:55,569 --> 04:11:58,700
It's been four, eight.

3689
04:11:58,700 --> 04:12:00,700
The first time I played through was like

3690
04:12:00,700 --> 04:12:02,700
six or seven maybe. It's like almost

3691
04:12:02,700 --> 04:12:04,700
15 to 18 hours of content I've

3692
04:12:04,700 --> 04:12:07,069
gotten for free.

3693
04:12:07,069 --> 04:12:11,360
I absolutely would pay for the next ones, for sure.

3694
04:12:11,360 --> 04:12:19,739
There's a lot more to see. Alright, I am going to

3695
04:12:19,739 --> 04:12:21,739
send you guys, because we're

3696
04:12:21,739 --> 04:12:23,739
pressed for time. There's not going to be an outro

3697
04:12:23,739 --> 04:12:25,739
to this stream. What's going to happen here is

3698
04:12:25,739 --> 04:12:27,739
I'm going to send you guys over to the tip of the hat stream

3699
04:12:27,739 --> 04:12:30,620
right now, and I will

3700
04:12:30,620 --> 04:12:32,620
see you if you go over there and you want to hang out.

3701
04:12:32,620 --> 04:12:34,620
I don't know how much longer.

3702
04:12:34,620 --> 04:12:38,270
I think they're going to be live for a little bit longer.

3703
04:12:38,270 --> 04:12:40,270
I'm going to go from there. I'm going to take a quick

3704
04:12:40,270 --> 04:12:42,270
little break. We're going to raid the tip of the hats.

3705
04:12:42,270 --> 04:12:44,579
I'm going to go to the

3706
04:12:44,579 --> 04:12:46,579
bathroom. I'm going to go to the water.

3707
04:12:46,579 --> 04:12:48,579
I will be appearing on that stream very

3708
04:12:48,579 --> 04:12:51,329
shortly. I will see you guys next weekend.

3709
04:12:51,329 --> 04:12:53,329
We'll go on Saturday of

3710
04:12:53,329 --> 04:12:55,329
this next week exactly. I'll see you Saturday, Sunday,

3711
04:12:55,329 --> 04:12:57,500
next weekend. Weekend, day, and day at it again.

3712
04:12:57,500 --> 04:13:03,059
I'll see you guys soon.

3713
04:13:03,059 --> 04:13:05,059
Go hang out at the tip of the hats if you want to see.

3714
04:13:05,059 --> 04:13:07,659
I think we're going to play, what's this called?

3715
04:13:07,659 --> 04:13:09,840
Gartic Phone?

3716
04:13:09,840 --> 04:13:12,850
I'm going to play Gartic Phone.

3717
04:13:12,850 --> 04:13:16,940
So I don't know how much longer that stream's

3718
04:13:16,940 --> 04:13:18,940
going to go for, but maybe at least enough

3719
04:13:18,940 --> 04:13:20,940
for it to hang out for an hour or so. I'm not sure.

3720
04:13:20,940 --> 04:13:27,840
Alright, let's raid.

3721
04:13:27,840 --> 04:13:29,840
I will see you guys later. See you next weekend. Thank you.

3722
04:13:29,840 --> 04:13:31,840
Delta Room was really good. It was awesome.

3723
04:13:31,840 --> 04:13:33,840
It was a great experience. Happy to have had it with you.

3724
04:13:33,840 --> 04:13:37,090
See you next weekend. Goodbye.

3725
04:13:37,090 --> 04:13:40,159
Good night. Take care of yourselves.

3726
04:13:40,159 --> 04:14:30,270
See you soon.

3727
04:14:35,420 --> 04:14:38,690
There's so many fucking boogers in my nose.

3728
04:14:38,690 --> 04:14:41,120
Oh my god, hot bike!

3729
04:14:41,120 --> 04:14:43,120
See you guys later.
