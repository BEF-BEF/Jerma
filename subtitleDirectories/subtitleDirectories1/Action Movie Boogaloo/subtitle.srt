1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,210
Oh, I see you. There you are. I see you next to the, you near the helicopter.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,500
No. Oh, I see Lee. Okay. Okay. Well,

3
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,380
you didn't expect somebody to break through the fucking glass, did you?

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:21,320
I did. I saw you. Oh, where's the checkpoint? Checkpoint. I don't know.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,600
This is confusing. Are we going to do a one V one now? Yeah. Checkpoint.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,850
I've won. I'm in the lead. That's not what happened. No, no. What,

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:36,100
what did happen? Oh, there is another person here. Well, whatever. Wait, wait,

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,579
wait, wait. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me. That's you.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm going to jump in that window.

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,219
I almost got it. Oh no. Oh no. I'm okay. Just go. Just go.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,299
Just go. Just jump. Just go. Just jump. Just go. Hi.

12
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,520
You're missing me. You cannot hit me with those punches.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,760
I got you.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,049
It's like falling. That was so stupid.

15
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,930
I am at the helicopter right now. Hey, here I come.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,060
Double action slide. How do I get out of here? Oh, are you stuck in there forever?

17
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:31,379
Here. Just watch, watch, watch a master. Do it. Watch a master.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,060
What did you, what happened to you? Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,299
Please come to me. All right.

20
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,739
So you're going to break through this glass and we're going to start the fight.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,420
Okay. Okay. I'm just going to come down on you.

22
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,859
He's going to break through the glass.

23
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:58,540
Are you ready? Right through the glass. Do it. Right through the glass.

24
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,379
Why didn't you break through the glass? You messed up the stunt action movie.

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,819
All right. So, so get in there. I can get in there. Can you,

26
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,780
I don't know if you really can. You've like, okay, you didn't get in.

27
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,990
You didn't make it in, but, uh, I'll take it.

28
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,060
So now I'm going to break through. So I'm going to go like this. All right.

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,219
Action movie. You know, why did you not do the action movie?

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,939
I didn't want to get blown up. You threw a grenade in. Oh, hi.

31
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,740
All right. I want to get the action movie clip. Okay. Oh, he's getting away.

32
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,620
He's out of his mind. He's getting away. Action.

33
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:50,620
Okay. I want to get the action movie clip now.

34
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:57,490
Fuck off. It's a brawler.

35
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,650
It's rocking. I want to get the action movie clip. Get in there. Okay.

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,610
What is the action? What are we trying? I'm doing the action movie.

37
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,370
This is my movie. I'm the director. I'm the producer. Okay.

38
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,009
No, you can make it. It's supposed to be part of the movie.

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,400
Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast material here.

40
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,210
It's pop tarts. Oh, pop tarts.

41
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:40,900
I want them too. Ooh, that was stylish. I got, Oh, what's this?

42
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,340
Slow motion. I better hide from you.

43
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:51,259
He's coming after you. He's really is. Why did he spawn right here?

44
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:54,349
Cause this is where.

45
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:01,819
No, these corners right here is like the majority of the spawns.

46
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,340
We're just all spawning on top of each other.

47
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,379
You think you're going to be able to mess with the walker?

48
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,699
You're not a walker. You have to be certified to be a walker.

49
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,540
You can fuck with the walker. Dead. Where are you hiding?

50
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,620
It's not hiding. I'm running around doing the checkpoints.

51
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,649
That's not very stylish of you to do. Oh, good grenade. Good night woman.

52
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,209
That wasn't even close to that. I seriously was not even close to that.

53
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,370
No, when you see that, you're going to see that. You're going to be like,

54
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,449
wow, I can't believe that actually. Oh, wow. That's interesting.

55
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,910
Yeah. Go fuck yourself.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
I can only imagine that I must've looked like a rocket.

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,480
You really were like jet propelled in my face.

58
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,699
Uh, the noise you made too.

59
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,589
Is this thing reloaded?

60
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:18,660
How could I not have hit you by now?

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,980
Did I get you in the head? Probably.

62
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,899
Where is this guy? He's up there. No, that's you again.

63
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,819
I'm not going to mess around this time. Who's slow mode?

64
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,100
Him. He came in behind us. Can I slow mo his slow mo?

65
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,620
You can slow mo his slow mo if you slow mo. We're stuck in slow mo.

66
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:48,040
Shit. Just come meet me at the secret hole.

67
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm coming to meet you at the secret hole.

68
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm down near the secret hole in the secret,

69
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
in the secrets of the lost temple of doom. Hey, what's up? That wasn't even you.

70
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,959
That wasn't even you. And I, I, I'm,

71
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680
I waited for him to do that. Are you serious? Yeah.

72
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,759
I just watched him coming down the hallway.

73
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,920
I probably scared the shit out of that guy though.

74
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,980
Cause I think he knows we are both secret hole and cause he kind of saw me go

75
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,540
down there. Does he know about the secret hole?

76
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,459
Well, he doesn't know about the fact that I'm behind. Oh,

77
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,779
he jumped at the same exact time. He still doesn't know I'm behind him.

78
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,600
He doesn't know anything about the secret hole. Come look for me.

79
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Come look for me in the secret hole.

80
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,040
Oh, he came and looked for me and it was perfect cause he has slow motion.

81
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,589
Grenade. You're just throwing grenades down the hole. Yeah.

82
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,170
You are a fucking dick. Secret hole.

83
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,660
Meet me maybe in the secret hole and you have to come down.

84
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,699
You have to come down the actual secret hole.

85
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,860
You can't like do like the sneaky secret hole part seriously.

86
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,459
Why would I think you were going to do anything else?

87
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,740
Why would I ever think you were going to do anything else?
