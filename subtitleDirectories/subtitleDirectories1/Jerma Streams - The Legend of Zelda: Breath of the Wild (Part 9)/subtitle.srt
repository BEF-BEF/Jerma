1
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:40,429
Alright, sorry I ruined the birthday. I walked back into the door, and I... I didn't forget that this was here, but I kind of... kind of did.

2
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:47,469
And I walked... I took down the... I walked into the thing that was hanging.

3
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:58,659
Okay, so now that was a ton of fun. I'm really surprised I had that much fun on Roblox.

4
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:04,659
I thought that was going to be like 20 minutes of just like, oh, whatever, let's just play something, or like an hour or something.

5
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:15,430
That was really fun. Yeah, I walked into the banner. I'll show you.

6
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:25,609
Um, let me turn my switch on. What about Five Nights at Freddy's?

7
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,650
I think Ster was just tired, and he just was like, taking off.

8
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:40,209
Because it's, uh, yeah, we're late night Andes over here.

9
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,469
That's it. We'll do it again. We'll do something else later. That's fine.

10
00:01:43,469 --> 00:02:07,680
I want to play that game, uh, with Poke2, the scary one. Let me make sure I am capturing this correctly.

11
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:19,060
One, one sec.

12
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:30,060
They're making a new BNAF movie. Holy shit.

13
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,889
Yeah, actually, when I was VRV, Polly was like, I thought you were hot micing.

14
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:54,409
No, I'm just stupid and had my desktop audio muted.

15
00:02:54,409 --> 00:03:03,620
Uh, why is my switch not working?

16
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,680
Um, is this not even plugged in? Oh, shit. Hold on.

17
00:03:10,680 --> 00:04:55,769
Give me one more second. I got to plug. I unplugged the switch for something else.

18
00:04:55,769 --> 00:05:00,899
Okay. Wait, did you not hear when I said I was going to leave? Wait, what?

19
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:03,899
I said I had to plug my switch in because it was unplugged.

20
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,920
You didn't hear that? Wait, what?

21
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,259
My audio is not delayed still, is it? It shouldn't be. That's weird. Okay.

22
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:28,759
Alright, let me just plug my headphones in. You should be able to see it now.

23
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:37,899
Or in a second.

24
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:56,970
Hey, there it is. Uh, let me just plug my actual headphones in.

25
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,670
Alright, it's time to play.

26
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:28,980
What was the last thing I did? What did I do last?

27
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,810
I do need to do this.

28
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,810
And if I'm going to have any face cam, I need to do this.

29
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,899
Like this. Hold on.

30
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,899
Oh, you want to see the, uh, yeah. Here, I'll show you.

31
00:06:46,899 --> 00:07:02,300
Oh, hold on. I fucked it up. Did I fuck it up?

32
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:12,120
Uh, yeah, I accidentally walked into it. I tore it down.

33
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,980
I hit my fucking head on the birthday.

34
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,350
No, I ducked. I was ducking down. That would mean I was very small.

35
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:32,699
Well, it's okay. Let me fix this because I need to delay this camera.

36
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:40,600
That should do it.

37
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,829
Alright, I am officially ready to play Breath of the Wild.

38
00:07:46,829 --> 00:08:05,310
Happy. And get...

39
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,639
Rip the decorations down when you fuck a puzzle up?

40
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:18,500
Alright, this is the last Divine Beast.

41
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,050
But I don't want to do that right now. I think I want to do...

42
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:40,049
What are some side... There's, like, the trials, right?

43
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:48,179
Should I do those? Go get your horse? Bottom right.

44
00:08:48,179 --> 00:09:04,100
Am I going to play Minecraft again?

45
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
There's an island with a really cool side quest down here.

46
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:23,919
Check it out. Ignored? What happened?

47
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:31,779
What did I ignore? Ignore what?

48
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:36,809
Oh, the horse. That's right. I'm imagining it's probably over here.

49
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,370
Not the horse, but this... Is this the island down here you're talking about?

50
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,370
Ooh, there is an island down... Wait, I was here before.

51
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,629
Isn't there, like, a big troll here?

52
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:59,820
Is this a stupid thing I'm doing?

53
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:28,539
I think I'm going to make it. I think I'll be alright.

54
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,539
I have stamina drinks.

55
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,820
Can you finally sing Happy Birthday?

56
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,320
Yeah, I said I wasn't, but fine.

57
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

58
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Happy birthday to... Whoever you're watching.

59
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Whoever's watching, right? And you distracted me.

60
00:10:44,320 --> 00:11:00,830
And you just probably got me killed.

61
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,139
How do I get down there?

62
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,769
Do I just have to make it with stamina?

63
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,860
I need stamina potions.

64
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
I think I have some, don't I?

65
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:25,370
Nah, this is haste.

66
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,370
Is there any stamina food?

67
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,100
I need a boat. Stamina potions.

68
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:43,029
Maybe I can't do it yet. Stealth. Cook a durian.

69
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:50,460
Well, I definitely can't do it yet.

70
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,779
There's a boat to your left.

71
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,419
Ooh, wait a minute. Over there?

72
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:08,789
Yeah, I think I remember that.

73
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,740
Actually, I can make this too, right?

74
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:20,059
I can teleport to the shrine. What am I doing?

75
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:30,460
My mom said you made her day by playing Roblox.

76
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,220
It was fun. That was some of the most fun I've had on stream, I think, in...

77
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,210
I don't know. It's been, like, a month or two. That was awesome.

78
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,960
That was just super fun, super funny.

79
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:53,980
There we go. Ooh, wait.

80
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:01,590
I need a leaf or something, don't I?

81
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:13,220
Isn't there usually, like, a leaf? What was that?

82
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:22,629
Cut a tree down? Oh, there it is.

83
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:32,450
I'm going to drop. What should I drop?

84
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm dropping this. I can get it later.

85
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,500
Drop the Master Sword? That would be awful.

86
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,230
I'm going to turn that thing back on.

87
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,230
This is to get one of those seeds.

88
00:13:51,230 --> 00:14:09,710
Hurry up! Got it.

89
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:21,789
Yeah, I need way more of these.

90
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:26,019
All right, that's the destination, right?

91
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:45,019
What the hell am I doing?

92
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:49,399
Okay, turn it.

93
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,350
What a gamer.

94
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,470
All right, so what did I do wrong?

95
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh, I thought...

96
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,740
He's throwing rocks at me.

97
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:20,549
Is there still an after party going on at the fashion contest?

98
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,200
That's the... I love it.

99
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
After party.

100
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,019
All right.

101
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:42,250
So, even tied up.

102
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,610
All right.

103
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,610
So, even tied island.

104
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,149
You who has traveled to this island,

105
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,909
I present you the challenge.

106
00:15:59,909 --> 00:16:01,909
In your travels, you've relied on the equipment...

107
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,909
Oh, that's right. It takes all your equipment and shit.

108
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:17,669
Offer up the orbs to the three altars on the island,

109
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:19,669
only them you... Okay.

110
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:24,519
So, three orbs.

111
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:34,759
All right. Is it puzzle stuff in this?

112
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,320
Oh, it's going in E mode only? Oh, no.

113
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,659
Uh...

114
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,659
Yeah, it's a big puzzle, isn't it?

115
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:49,289
All right. We're good. We're good. We're good.

116
00:16:49,289 --> 00:17:00,419
I got a stick.

117
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:07,140
Oh, I don't have a bow. Shit.

118
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:19,670
Bananas.

119
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,740
30 minutes?

120
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
This is not going to take 10 minutes?

121
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:36,579
You're saying 30 minutes?

122
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:50,019
There's an axe right there.

123
00:17:50,019 --> 00:18:03,339
I didn't even fucking jump.

124
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:13,380
Okay. Woodcutter's axe.

125
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
All right. So, I'm going to cut down some trees.

126
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:30,089
Okay.

127
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:36,140
Wood. Okay.

128
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:45,990
I probably need a bunch of wood.

129
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:58,329
I got three wood.

130
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,700
I don't think I have any... I don't want to die.

131
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Ooh. Okay. Good. I still have this.

132
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,420
Should I eat the bananas or should I cook the bananas?

133
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Probably cook, right? Yeah. All right.

134
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,549
I'm going to cook. Wait. I need something to light it.

135
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:17,990
No. No, no, no. I need something to light it.

136
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:43,640
I could fight these guys.

137
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:55,849
Shit. That's a lot of

138
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,849
nose. You guys don't think I can do it?

139
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:00,859
That's a ton of...

140
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:05,779
That's way too many nose.

141
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,920
I got it. All right. Here's one.

142
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:19,990
Ooh. Bow. Good. Soldier's bow.

143
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,500
What?

144
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:39,690
Okay. I got one.

145
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,119
I need three. What do I bring

146
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,599
these? Wait. There's a fire right here.

147
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:59,910
All right. Should I cook individual

148
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:10,730
bananas? Roasted mighty

149
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,859
banana. It doesn't do anything. How is

150
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,859
that any better than a regular

151
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:23,990
banana? Okay. Let's do this.

152
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,809
A couple bananas.

153
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,140
This should be pretty good.

154
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,960
Wait. It's not a stove. Pick it

155
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
all up. Oh, shit.

156
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,450
It's not a stove.

157
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:53,430
Okay.

158
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:04,279
Okay.

159
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:15,349
What do I take this?

160
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:33,640
Isn't it up? All right. I'm going to go up.

161
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,890
I think it's actually up. I'm

162
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,890
90% certain that it's on one of the mountains.

163
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,339
No, no, no. Wait. There's one

164
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:54,069
kind of on the beach, right?

165
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:56,250
Please don't wake up.

166
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:09,160
Why did you let

167
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
go of it? Why did I let go of it?

168
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:23,559
What? All right.

169
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:38,279
I need this. Right there.

170
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:41,289
I need to just despawn this guy.

171
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:49,289
All right. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here.

172
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:57,779
Okay.

173
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:17,670
You can't run with this. How are they so

174
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:28,420
accurate? This is going to unlock

175
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:44,359
something, probably, right? I hope so.

176
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,730
Why are you laughing at me? It's not funny yet.

177
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,349
It's not funny yet.

178
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:59,450
Okay. Hold on.

179
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:07,380
Shit. I'm terrified

180
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:30,730
of this. Can I

181
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:40,779
golf it over there?

182
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:47,690
Am I going to lose it if I go in here with this?

183
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,730
I am, aren't I? No?

184
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,730
Wait. I'm not going to. I won't lose it.

185
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,079
This is very conflicting.

186
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,079
I don't know what to do.

187
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:47,799
I have an idea. All right.

188
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm not supposed to do it like this. I'm just

189
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
going to go for it and whatever happens happens because I'm just

190
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
going to test and see if this is even possible.

191
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,509
Am I going to lose this shit?

192
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:03,509
No. This is bad. This is a bad idea.

193
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:09,529
Is there another spot on the map

194
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:14,329
where one of those is?

195
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,329
Don't even do that.

196
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:23,099
Rebranch?

197
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:30,390
I'm so paranoid just to walk over there

198
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:37,299
with it. I probably can just

199
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,480
walk over there. Whatever.

200
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:49,980
People are going to laugh at me. It's fine.

201
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,980
Okay. I didn't lose it though. I had the right

202
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:59,910
idea. I thought it was going to disappear.

203
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:08,099
Yeah. I was just paranoid that it wasn't going to go away.

204
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,099
Like it was just going to disappear.

205
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:35,240
Let's go. All right. There's

206
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:45,720
one. What does that do?

207
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,109
Okay. So I got

208
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:51,109
I just put free in there and I'm good.

209
00:28:51,109 --> 00:29:01,269
What is happening? Thank God.

210
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:03,269
I just did that. That would have been a

211
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,619
disaster. Okay.

212
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,930
There are two more balls on the island.

213
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:17,930
Got to find them. That was almost

214
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:39,369
frame perfect. I'm going to have to kill

215
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:44,359
that thing, aren't I, eventually? I'm going up.

216
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:48,259
I know there's another one up there. I remember

217
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:56,519
seeing it. So the play is just don't

218
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,519
aggro the big guy, right?

219
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:05,160
That's what I would think.

220
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:18,789
Oh shit. There's another one.

221
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:28,119
Oh.

222
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:45,130
It'll get solid.

223
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:51,849
Do they notice this?

224
00:30:51,849 --> 00:31:09,819
Ah! How do I move this?

225
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:46,859
Wait. Will that, does that actually work?

226
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:51,210
That's going to get struck by lightning, right?

227
00:31:51,210 --> 00:32:35,029
Do I have to have it equipped? How do I get this

228
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:42,069
to strike? Come on.

229
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:45,269
I don't even know who I'm walking onto.

230
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:07,460
Go. Come on.

231
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:32,680
Where's the flurry? You got

232
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,140
to be fucking kidding me, dude. Can I

233
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,299
stand up here? There's a spot right there.

234
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:46,299
Come on. No!

235
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:48,299
Yes.

236
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,539
Oh, thank God. I'm so relieved. Thank goodness.

237
00:33:50,539 --> 00:34:05,000
Don't get greedy. Just climb.

238
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,210
If I just do it normally, I'll be fine.

239
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:33,800
Just do it normally. Yes. All right.

240
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,369
Do I have any food? I do.

241
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:48,599
I'm just eating them. Okay. Can I

242
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,420
clear it with my lightning move?

243
00:34:51,420 --> 00:35:07,139
I just killed everything else.

244
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,139
I wasn't even close. I just killed everything else

245
00:35:09,139 --> 00:35:11,699
in the whole map. What?

246
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,940
Oh, I can cook here. All right.

247
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:27,050
Let me clear this.

248
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,380
All right. We're good.

249
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
Now I can take a good look and figure this out.

250
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:47,719
Arrows. Food.

251
00:35:47,719 --> 00:36:02,309
Hell yeah. All right. I can cook now.

252
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:04,309
Ooh. Somebody said to find one of those. I just found one.

253
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,219
Happy birthday.

254
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:16,019
Happy birthday.

255
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:29,139
Take a picture and then kapow.

256
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:42,519
I gotta delete some of these pictures. What's this?

257
00:36:42,519 --> 00:37:04,329
Pretty cool rock. Shit.

258
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:21,539
How do I break it? Smash. Kapow.

259
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,099
Smash. I did not even know

260
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:26,099
this was small, like big enough to do this with.

261
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:30,309
I thought it was too big.

262
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:37,800
All right. Nice. That's two.

263
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,090
There's only one more. Nice.

264
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:52,840
All right. One more. We're good.

265
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,809
So where's this last one?

266
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:02,440
Let me cook some food for us.

267
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,440
You got ten minutes left. Oh, I got...

268
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
I got ten minutes for each ball.

269
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm gonna be close. All right. I'm gonna pay attention.

270
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:19,750
I need fire.

271
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:26,219
All right. Where's this last one?

272
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:29,539
It's on his neck. All right. Watch this.

273
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:46,570
I'm gonna drop this on this fucking guy's head.

274
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:52,710
Come on, Link. You can do it.

275
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,710
Come on. Push it. You can do it. I know you can.

276
00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:15,030
Perfect.

277
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:52,199
Perfect. Crush his head.

278
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:01,349
Shit. I just killed a fucking

279
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,349
goat accidentally. All right.

280
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:21,780
I thought it was gonna roll.

281
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,539
I'm gonna walk this down. Wait, wait, wait.

282
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:27,349
I want to bring this too. Where is it?

283
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:30,809
I'm gonna be strategic. This is the last one.

284
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,809
I gotta be strategic. It respawned.

285
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,809
It wants me to do that, I think. I think it wants me to do that.

286
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,050
It wants me to crush him. Look.

287
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,570
It's back. It's back.

288
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,739
It's right here. It wants me to crush him.

289
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:56,119
That's not bad.

290
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:04,500
God damn it.

291
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
All right. It hit him.

292
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:32,809
At least it hit his ass.

293
00:41:32,809 --> 00:42:10,550
How do I get him? I get it. Uh-oh.

294
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:21,369
It hit him right in the fucking head.

295
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:23,369
Why would I have this equipped?

296
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:41,989
Why did I have this equipped?

297
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:54,730
What the hell?

298
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,400
I'm alive.

299
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive. I'm alive.

300
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:46,820
I need more arrows.

301
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,070
That's the problem.

302
00:43:52,070 --> 00:44:06,150
There's a lizard here. Don't hit me. Please don't hit me.

303
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:23,369
Please get up.

304
00:44:23,369 --> 00:45:13,019
Climb.

305
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:23,900
Holy shit. Look at this. Oh my god.

306
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,739
This is bad. Oh my god.

307
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:29,739
He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up.

308
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:31,739
He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up. He's coming up.

309
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:34,099
Hold on. Do not blow those up, please.

310
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,099
I need those.

311
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:41,670
My lightning move isn't cooled down.

312
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:54,409
What's wrong with him?

313
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:56,409
What's he doing?

314
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:58,409
What is he doing?

315
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:01,420
Everybody fuck off for a second.

316
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:10,760
Just get out of the fucking way.

317
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:28,489
Oh.

318
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:40,650
That didn't even hurt him.

319
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,650
What am I doing?

320
00:46:42,650 --> 00:47:03,059
I'm zooming in on his crotch.

321
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:05,059
Fine. I'm fine.

322
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:16,199
I am going to be just fine.

323
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,199
I just have to smear this all over his fucking head a few more times.

324
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:26,070
I just have to smear this all over his fucking head a few more times.

325
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:42,650
Get out of here.

326
00:47:42,650 --> 00:48:01,269
You fuck off. Can I punch you?

327
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:03,269
Oh, let's go.

328
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:19,579
Oh.

329
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:33,510
I got him. Stop.

330
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,510
Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving.

331
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:56,550
So close.

332
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:58,550
Stop. You have what?

333
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,550
It's not over? What do you mean?

334
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:06,570
What time is it?

335
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:14,059
What time is it?

336
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:20,650
31 minutes.

337
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,400
I didn't know that lightning instantly killed him.

338
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,719
I didn't have it charged either.

339
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:33,940
It spawns one of these.

340
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:48,260
Now there's a shrine up there.

341
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,489
I'm going to enter the shrine.

342
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,489
You could have just walked up and taken his necklace while he was sleeping.

343
00:49:54,489 --> 00:50:01,059
Oh.

344
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:15,960
That's good to know.

345
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,960
What's wrong with my face?

346
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,989
My face is kind of weird.

347
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:34,150
It was really close?

348
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:40,869
I should probably cook some food, but I'm not going to.

349
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:43,500
That was fun.

350
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:51,239
Is there an easy way to get up here?

351
00:50:51,239 --> 00:51:06,889
It's fine.

352
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:13,210
Alright, so what's in here?

353
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,539
Your eyes are all messed up?

354
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:26,260
Something in my teeth?

355
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:40,539
Everyone's cyberbullying him.

356
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:45,980
Dude, Roblox was so fun.

357
00:51:45,980 --> 00:52:02,679
We should definitely do it again.

358
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:20,710
300 rupees. Okay, I'll take it.

359
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,710
Oh, also, people started getting the grotto beasts.

360
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,269
We've seen a lot of people writing

361
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:27,269
like, hey, look what I got.

362
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,269
Look what I got. Look what I got.

363
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:32,860
I think a lot of the kits have gone out.

364
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,099
If you have ordered it, keep an eye out.

365
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:38,230
I would anticipate it very soon

366
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,230
if you ordered it in the first week or so of the presale.

367
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:47,000
Got mine yesterday.

368
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,300
Also, the FAQ

369
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,780
and the

370
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,780
quick start rules should be on

371
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,780
the site now.

372
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,369
They should be there on the bottom of the page.

373
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:06,019
It should be like a PDF or something.

374
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,019
So, a while back

375
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:11,289
I talked about the baby

376
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,360
being a digital version. So, over the last

377
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,599
I want to say a couple weeks, two or three weeks

378
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:18,599
we've been really trying to figure out what that

379
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,599
meant and what a digital

380
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:23,780
version was going to be. So,

381
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,960
I will tell you right now what we are

382
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,960
doing right now, what we're exploring right now, and it's

383
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,199
currently the thing that we are

384
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:34,230
doing. We're going to do a tabletop simulator

385
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,030
mod, a free mod

386
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:41,300
that, there's a person here,

387
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
is going to have all 200 cards available.

388
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,250
And the idea was to make it so

389
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,510
so the

390
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,510
actual experience is not going to be like

391
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,510
card pack pay openings

392
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,510
or anything. It's not like, oh yeah, let's

393
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,510
buy more card packs digitally.

394
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,329
We understand that there's a lot

395
00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:02,329
of people that want to play with other people that just

396
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:04,329
don't really have any way to do that

397
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:06,329
because there is a game, right? There's a game on top

398
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,329
of it. So,

399
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,329
the game designer

400
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,329
and we're going to get some

401
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:14,630
other people like

402
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,630
the core art team and maybe

403
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,630
a 3D designer is going to come in and

404
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,630
we're going to make a whole experience in tabletop simulator.

405
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,960
Just tons of

406
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,960
little toys and it's going to be a whole

407
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,960
experience. It's not just going to be, here's a

408
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,960
wooden desk with all 200 cards. Good

409
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,960
luck. They're going to dev it out.

410
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,030
So, if you don't have tabletop

411
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,269
simulator, that's, I mean

412
00:54:37,269 --> 00:54:39,269
I think that, it goes on sale

413
00:54:39,269 --> 00:54:43,300
a lot, doesn't it? I think it's pretty cheap too.

414
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,300
I think it's only like, what, 10, 15 bucks?

415
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:52,539
20 bucks? Yeah, very often.

416
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:58,360
But it also gives an opportunity for the, so the

417
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,360
game designer is going to be

418
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,360
kind of curating that space

419
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,599
on top of the art team. So

420
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,599
it's just going to be free. You can

421
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,599
have fun, play with it, play with your friends.

422
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,599
That's kind of the idea.

423
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,400
I'm seeking adventure.

424
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,090
You and I have that in common. It is only from here

425
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,090
that I can probably hear the wind.

426
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:26,869
I want to live as the wind does, free and unrestricted

427
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,869
to bide here and listen to

428
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:30,869
its voice offers a taste of that freedom.

429
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,869
Don't you long to be like the wind

430
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:36,260
too? It didn't really occur to me.

431
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:41,769
We can read the messages ourselves.

432
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:44,070
These?

433
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,070
You don't want me to read them to you?

434
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:53,610
Okay. Is there anything else

435
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,909
to do with this bird? Have you returned a train

436
00:55:55,909 --> 00:55:57,909
to become the wind?

437
00:55:57,909 --> 00:56:01,500
Okay. 20 rupees

438
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,949
to set it, alright, let's go.

439
00:56:04,949 --> 00:56:07,380
Wait here while I prepare the course. Obstacle course?

440
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:23,699
So I gotta fly through these?

441
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:52,679
Gotta go faster than this.

442
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,679
Daruk's protection is now ready to roll.

443
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:59,989
Goku? No.

444
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:05,110
All the way up. Oh, over here.

445
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:12,659
Whoops. Wait, go down.

446
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:15,929
Oh!

447
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,420
I gotta go.

448
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,420
Wait, what happened? Why do I have no stamina?

449
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,420
Am I gonna fall?

450
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,110
Wait, why did I run out of stamina?

451
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,699
Do I not have enough stamina to do it?

452
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:40,980
I need to eat stamina food.

453
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:47,059
23 rings.

454
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:51,909
He gave me my money back.

455
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:56,329
You know what, here, take it back.

456
00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:00,230
Let's do it again.

457
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,980
Release the glider when you're descending.

458
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,980
Oh, that's true.

459
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:25,079
Alright, let's go.

460
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,079
Do I have an opportunity to release it though?

461
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:52,659
How did I not go through it?

462
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,659
Oh!

463
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:56,659
Shit, alright, I gotta...

464
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:12,710
That's a tricky one.

465
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,530
Let go in the middle and then press it again?

466
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,530
No, I wanna do it again.

467
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:27,179
You gonna beat the game tonight?

468
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:29,179
No, no, I'm just gonna do some side stuff.

469
00:59:29,179 --> 00:59:34,099
Eat stamina food. I don't have any.

470
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:37,500
I'm gonna have to come back here when I do.

471
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:58,230
I went through it.

472
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,230
You saw me do that. I went right through the middle.

473
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,670
What the fuck just happened?

474
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:47,699
Whatever, I got 25.

475
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:54,090
Okay, I made money. I wanna do it again.

476
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,219
That's the end of the course, right?

477
01:00:57,219 --> 01:01:32,980
Is that the end? Oh, it's not.

478
01:02:02,659 --> 01:02:05,539
Did you actually play Roblox?

479
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:09,429
Yeah, me, poke, and stir.

480
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:14,300
It was a ton of fun. Poke is fucking hilarious too.

481
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,750
So stir.

482
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,750
The vibe of that group is really fun.

483
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:34,539
Let me go this way.

484
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:44,579
I'm gonna go for air this time.

485
01:02:44,579 --> 01:03:11,960
Much better.

486
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,780
Where? Over here?

487
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,780
Get the fuck away from me.

488
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:22,199
What's going on?

489
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,199
Dude, get the lightning out of here.

490
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,199
The lightning is distracting as fuck.

491
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:29,019
Distracting as fuck.

492
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:45,059
Relax. That was better than before.

493
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:48,820
Nice.

494
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,820
I'm gonna try one more time. I beat it, but I wanna do one more.

495
01:03:50,820 --> 01:04:05,340
31 is the biggest one?

496
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:36,489
That was risky, but I did it.

497
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:44,489
Don't even fucking think about it.

498
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,489
Don't strike me with lightning, please.

499
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:52,380
That was going so well too.

500
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:57,429
That was going so well.

501
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:59,429
That was like the best...

502
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:13,260
I probably wasn't gonna 100% that.

503
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,260
That was going so good too. Take off the armor?

504
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:41,349
Okay, I don't have any gear on anymore.

505
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:43,530
I shouldn't get struck by lightning.

506
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:58,550
Can I get a bunch of bananas or something?

507
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:25,030
Alright, let's go.

508
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:37,429
I think I screwed it up. I think I'm alright.

509
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:39,860
No. The first one was so much better.

510
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:50,420
What is happening with that shit?

511
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:53,429
Why do I go through, but it doesn't count?

512
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:55,610
Why do I go through, but it doesn't count?

513
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,980
What's going on?

514
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:05,530
I just went through three times.

515
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:25,219
I have to do it. Why do I keep doing this with my mouth?

516
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:35,530
Like this? I had it that time.

517
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:39,050
Did I get struck by lightning?

518
01:07:39,050 --> 01:08:09,300
Alright, last try and that's it. No matter what.

519
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,300
Let's try to get too flashy with it.

520
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,300
No, just try again. I was being flashy.

521
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,699
I was trying to be so flashy.

522
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:29,619
That was stupid.

523
01:08:29,619 --> 01:09:10,420
Alright, this is actually the last one no matter what.

524
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:12,420
Let's go.

525
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:41,739
Why are you talking? What happened?

526
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:50,569
I just won.

527
01:09:50,569 --> 01:09:53,380
Just go. I need to get the money back.

528
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:00,100
I was going to say, I love how my knees can go through.

529
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,100
But if my head goes through it doesn't count.

530
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:10,920
Why am I losing so much momentum now?

531
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,920
Why can I not do it anymore?

532
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,510
I don't get it.

533
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,510
I've done this like ten times. These last three times I've just fallen on the ground.

534
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:57,829
Alright, this is the last one.

535
01:10:57,829 --> 01:11:06,460
It's alright. I think I'm fine.

536
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:18,939
What part of your body has to go through the rings?

537
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:20,939
Because sometimes my knees go through and it doesn't work.

538
01:11:20,939 --> 01:11:28,039
Sometimes my head goes through and it does.

539
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:36,149
The middle of my body has to go through.

540
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:38,149
Why does this keep screwing up?

541
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:40,649
I've done this like fifteen times now.

542
01:11:40,649 --> 01:12:10,220
I'm doing it the exact way I did it before.

543
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:14,170
Oh my god.

544
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:37,079
Just go.

545
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,090
Dude, I can do that. I know I can.

546
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:56,659
I know I can do that.

547
01:12:56,659 --> 01:13:01,779
I made all my money back. We're good. I can do it again.

548
01:13:01,779 --> 01:13:07,289
I made it all back. We're good. Everything's fine.

549
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:09,289
Are you guys betting on these? I think I'm going too quick for you to bet.

550
01:13:09,289 --> 01:13:13,829
Alright, this is actually going to be the one for real.

551
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:53,380
No more messing around.

552
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:55,380
What are you talking about?

553
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:58,010
Why is this so finicky?

554
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:00,010
Why is this so finicky?

555
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,010
What? Are you crazy?

556
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,010
What?

557
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:28,260
I'm making money but

558
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:34,340
What the hell?

559
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,340
How can I get the first one and not the second one?

560
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,340
I just got the first one. It's a fucking air vent.

561
01:14:38,340 --> 01:15:49,369
Yes!

562
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:52,439
There it is. I got it.

563
01:15:52,439 --> 01:16:16,359
What happened? Oh no, people are still betting.

564
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:20,649
Oh, I only get a hundred? I thought I was going to get something more.

565
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:26,729
Well, I left it with like three hundred extra dollars.

566
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:39,020
That's cool.

567
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,510
I missed one? No, don't tell me that.

568
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:45,420
I'm not going to do it anymore. Alright, where should I go from here?

569
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,359
That was cool. I can remove this.

570
01:16:48,359 --> 01:16:57,510
It's thirty-five, not thirty-four.

571
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:05,880
Eh, it's alright. I want

572
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,399
Can I upgrade my gear?

573
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:23,850
Where was that? It's like over here, isn't it?

574
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:32,550
Upgrade the Master Sword. Fifty plus is the top reward.

575
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:42,729
How would you even do that?

576
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:45,800
Where's the, where's the

577
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:57,510
Kakariko? Whatever it is.

578
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:07,479
Salmon upgrade? Southeast.

579
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:12,260
Where is it? Hyrule Field.

580
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:22,939
East. Oh, it's right here. Isn't it?

581
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:26,199
Where is it? Right here. Where's the upgrade person?

582
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:40,220
I want to upgrade. It's marked with a leaf?

583
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:55,369
Isn't this where I have to, the big forest,

584
01:18:55,369 --> 01:18:57,369
big bunch of trees and shit and I have to go

585
01:18:57,369 --> 01:19:16,039
this way, right? Yeah. What was that?

586
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:37,140
Is that something cool? I don't even know if I have

587
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,380
any ingredients to do this. I don't.

588
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:47,899
I probably do. It's been like

589
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:50,199
six to ten in-game hours.

590
01:19:50,199 --> 01:20:09,380
I can do this. I mean,

591
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:15,659
I might as well put your clothes back on.

592
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:19,560
Wait, can you not actually do it with my clothes on?

593
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:27,939
I don't, I think it just said I couldn't

594
01:20:27,939 --> 01:20:33,380
really do anything. I don't think it's worth it.

595
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:39,260
Yeah, no,

596
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
it didn't have to be on.

597
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,010
Nah, I'm going to wear it. I want

598
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:49,449
this one. I like this stuff. Swim speed

599
01:20:49,449 --> 01:20:51,449
is cool, but I think I already did that area.

600
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:56,170
I feel like I really need it. Although those horns,

601
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,170
I feel like I have a lot of those.

602
01:20:58,170 --> 01:21:00,170
I don't know how rare those horns are.

603
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:05,539
Go find another fairy.

604
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:07,539
Four upgrades per piece.

605
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:17,260
Doesn't cost like nothing.

606
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:19,260
There's other fairy fountains. Oh, okay.

607
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:25,020
I'll just do it. Why not?

608
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:47,140
Set bonuses.

609
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:57,239
I have.

610
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,239
So it said follow the path behind

611
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:01,239
this area. Follow the

612
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:03,239
path and there's something to do.

613
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:26,710
I'll check it out. Cool.

614
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:35,159
Okay, follow the path.

615
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,909
Like the actual path path, like

616
01:22:37,909 --> 01:22:40,090
the road. Or is there some like secret

617
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:47,000
over here I haven't seen? What is

618
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,520
your bedtime?

619
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,520
Maybe a little bit.

620
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:57,239
Northeast. Like over

621
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:10,939
here? Do I have to

622
01:23:10,939 --> 01:23:22,899
climb out of here?

623
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:27,189
Am I going the right way? Path

624
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:29,560
does not mean climb. I mean, I feel like

625
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,800
I'm at the end of the

626
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
forest here in the northern section.

627
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,810
Just kind of stay. I mean,

628
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:52,340
you mean like over here? Yeah.

629
01:23:52,340 --> 01:24:18,310
I think this is it. Birthday

630
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:29,319
raid song. I don't have any weapons

631
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:41,909
equipped. Not bad. Who's my horse?

632
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:46,439
Um, I don't know. I never seem to have

633
01:24:46,439 --> 01:24:52,390
the horse. About a year ago I was walking along

634
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,390
the road here at night when I suddenly saw a

635
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:56,390
blinding light in the sky. When my eyes finally

636
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,390
just started looking at a shimmering object floating

637
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,210
overhead, I couldn't look away. I was bathed in light

638
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:03,210
when I came to. I woke up in bed covered in sweat.

639
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:07,289
What do you think about

640
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:14,649
that? That sounds like a dream.

641
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:16,649
Bed full of liquid in an empty room and

642
01:25:16,649 --> 01:25:18,649
when I looked in the corner there was a weird glowing

643
01:25:18,649 --> 01:25:21,079
device. When I touched the device

644
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:23,079
I was overwhelmed with a feeling of familiarity.

645
01:25:23,079 --> 01:25:26,579
When I came to I was here.

646
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:29,659
What do you think about that? Does that sound familiar?

647
01:25:29,659 --> 01:25:31,829
Hylian Champion.

648
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:33,829
Master Koga.

649
01:25:33,829 --> 01:26:06,899
I ain't dying here. Got ya!

650
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:12,390
Ooh! Demon

651
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:21,420
Carver. Alright. What can I drop?

652
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:28,250
It's not what I wanted. Okay.

653
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,420
So left or right here? I'm going to say

654
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:32,420
right. Right looks kind of interesting.

655
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:34,659
Keep the leaf. Keep the leaf

656
01:26:34,659 --> 01:26:47,699
please. Keep the leaf.

657
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:53,340
That's a lot of damage. In exchange for what?

658
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:55,340
I don't know what to drop. You don't need the leaf.

659
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:02,760
Oh, people are trolling. Okay.

660
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,760
Yeah, there's a million trees

661
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:23,579
in this world. I'll find another one.

662
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:25,579
Interesting. Okay.

663
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:35,880
You could beat Ganon

664
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:39,130
with a leaf. Um,

665
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:41,369
probably not. I highly

666
01:27:41,369 --> 01:28:19,000
doubt that. How do you break these

667
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,100
without blowing them up? Do I have to blow these up

668
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:32,100
with the magnet? Just by smashing them?

669
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:51,479
Oh, okay. Cool. Nice.

670
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:54,020
I got a lot of money. I could probably

671
01:28:54,020 --> 01:29:18,979
buy something nice. You need a big two-hander

672
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:25,319
to break them. I mean, this is effective. It doesn't really

673
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:55,180
do it a couple times.

674
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:03,800
That did not hit me. Master Sword.

675
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:16,859
Where's the Master Sword? I mean, it recharges

676
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:18,859
in time. Yeah, how come it's not on the menu though?

677
01:30:18,859 --> 01:30:36,630
That's kind of freaking me out. Yes.

678
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:48,140
That's very good. Ooh.

679
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:53,060
Down here. Ah,

680
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:57,989
that's why everybody wanted me to get a leaf.

681
01:30:57,989 --> 01:31:08,359
Now I understand. I can

682
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:13,159
swim this. That's not a problem. It's not

683
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:18,979
even deep. Where's the actual line?

684
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:29,140
Is it underwater?

685
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:45,079
Underwater. All right. Get up.

686
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:56,899
Get on the thing. What are you doing?

687
01:31:56,899 --> 01:32:27,689
Hey. Nice. As long as I don't

688
01:32:27,689 --> 01:32:30,250
dash, I think I can. Wait. What on my

689
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:42,020
swim? I just upgraded it. How come you're not listening

690
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:46,310
to us? Uh, I'm going

691
01:32:46,310 --> 01:33:07,239
behind the waterfall, right? Swim upwards.

692
01:33:07,239 --> 01:33:24,899
Swim upwards. Quick. I don't even know what just

693
01:33:24,899 --> 01:33:51,699
happened. All right. What's wrong?

694
01:33:51,699 --> 01:33:59,050
That's a very good idea. I think I'll do it.

695
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,420
How do I get under there though?

696
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:44,260
Climb it. Oh, shit. Yep.

697
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,439
What is in here? This looks pretty expensive.

698
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:53,220
Whatever it is. Soldier's

699
01:34:53,220 --> 01:35:03,020
broadsword. Should I get rid of the

700
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:05,020
bat? This thing is 60 damage though.

701
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:11,909
That's ridiculous. Not worth it. It's

702
01:35:11,909 --> 01:35:14,539
terrible. Got extra durability though.

703
01:35:14,539 --> 01:35:46,180
Not worth it. Okay. So

704
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,180
now what's the deal here?

705
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:52,920
Should I just swim up? How do I

706
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,399
get down? Swim under?

707
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:02,460
I don't think there is like a dive,

708
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,300
right? Swim through. It's behind it.

709
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:13,909
Oh,

710
01:36:13,909 --> 01:36:19,159
okay. So now what?

711
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:33,100
Uh, where am I?

712
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:37,319
Look up. I'm gonna fucking die. Hold on.

713
01:36:37,319 --> 01:36:40,520
What? No. Dude, stop.

714
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:45,130
Just let- You killing me here.

715
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:59,529
You- I- I can't go down.

716
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:04,199
You said- Do you say it was underwater or is it

717
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:13,350
up above here? It's not

718
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:15,350
down. Oh, I thought people were telling me to dive down.

719
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:25,340
Chat- Chat is dumb. It's

720
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:29,239
behind the waterfall. What?

721
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:44,220
What the hell is up here?

722
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:57,270
Am I even moving? Okay.

723
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:05,140
I thought it was under- I thought it was down, like in the-

724
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:09,430
under the water or something. Okay,

725
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:18,710
this makes way more sense. I saw like

726
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:20,710
the reflection in the water. I thought it was like

727
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:26,859
down in the water. That shit

728
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:29,159
wouldn't even reflect that far. Unrealistic.

729
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:48,279
Alright, what is this?

730
01:38:48,279 --> 01:38:50,279
Uh, I don't think we're doing any voting

731
01:38:50,279 --> 01:39:02,949
or betting. Alright, chest.

732
01:39:02,949 --> 01:39:09,670
Are you gonna turn any- emote only on though or are you gonna kill me?

733
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:15,939
You're gonna get me killed. Cause I can't

734
01:39:15,939 --> 01:39:20,039
see the chat and they can't help me. Alright.

735
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:29,689
Big button. Big button

736
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:36,220
can't- ooh, okay, hold on.

737
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:38,220
What does this big button need?

738
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:41,930
Can I put like a chest on it?

739
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:45,449
Okay. I think it's just a weight thing.

740
01:39:45,449 --> 01:40:17,689
Is it a weight thing? It's gotta be

741
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:34,699
it, right? Okay. That's enough

742
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:52,100
weight. Okay.

743
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:59,210
This goes over here. And then I climb

744
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:04,970
that. Wait, let me get the items first.

745
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:06,970
This is not gonna mess with the weight, is it?

746
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:15,399
Nope, not. Zora sword? If that's any

747
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:24,020
better than what I have. Zora sword

748
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:28,680
meh. 14 damage.

749
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:44,489
That's really not that much. How do I-

750
01:41:44,489 --> 01:41:54,390
Oh, like this. Is it?

751
01:41:54,390 --> 01:42:15,770
Well, I hit the wrong button. Do I have four?

752
01:42:15,770 --> 01:42:17,770
I think like- I feel like I need way

753
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:35,539
more stamina. How many do I have? You can't

754
01:42:35,539 --> 01:42:43,159
see it, but it's two. Very cool.

755
01:42:43,159 --> 01:42:45,909
What else is down here? Anything else I should do?

756
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:59,270
Probably. Can you just do a shrine

757
01:42:59,270 --> 01:43:04,779
normally? There's a memory

758
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:08,939
down here apparently. Okay. Hold on.

759
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:20,899
Let me get this. Ooh, wait. What's this?

760
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:30,699
Should I climb up here? I'm climbing up here.

761
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:42,859
Are you more like Zelda or Link?

762
01:43:42,859 --> 01:43:45,930
What's that little- what's that little weird guy?

763
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:49,000
He like does confetti and like

764
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,590
flies around. Tingle. Yeah.

765
01:43:55,590 --> 01:44:11,260
I wonder if I should just keep going that way.

766
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:23,159
But, I'm intrigued.

767
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:26,229
Vinny also said he's like Tingle.

768
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:29,109
Yeah, okay. Vinny's a smart

769
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:48,170
fucking guy. Get away from me.

770
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:50,979
I'm going across this bridge. I'm not going to fight

771
01:44:50,979 --> 01:44:55,979
these. Why would I? You can't

772
01:44:55,979 --> 01:45:00,899
both be Tingle.

773
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:13,689
Who can I be? Ganon? No.

774
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:15,689
No way. I'm

775
01:45:15,689 --> 01:45:24,390
way too lazy to be Ganon. The prospect

776
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:27,140
of taking over the entire universe.

777
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:29,140
Like, oh yeah, alright. The whole fucking

778
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,140
universe. Let's- I kind of just want to

779
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:33,140
watch The Office on Netflix. Never mind.

780
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,770
That was a- eh. I don't care.

781
01:45:35,770 --> 01:46:08,439
Check your iPad. Memories.

782
01:46:08,439 --> 01:46:24,310
Found it. Oh, that's right. Okay.

783
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:58,729
Shh. Let's see.

784
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,310
One second, I felt like I was still

785
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:26,310
in Roblox.

786
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:30,310
After all, it's not like your last shot

787
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:32,310
was up there on Mount Mineru.

788
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:34,310
Anything could finally spark the power

789
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:36,310
to seal Ganon away. We just

790
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:38,310
have to keep looking for that

791
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:43,560
thing. That's kind of you.

792
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:45,560
Roblox

793
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,560
brain rot. If I may.

794
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:56,140
There is to say it,

795
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:59,210
but I was thinking about what I do

796
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:01,960
when I'm feeling. You know, what

797
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,960
usually goes through my mind.

798
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,840
It helps when I think- when I think

799
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:10,229
about it.

800
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:35,579
This is it, then.

801
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:37,579
Are you sure? Positive.

802
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:39,579
It's awake. Ganon.

803
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:47,260
Let's stop wasting

804
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,260
time. We're gonna need everything we got

805
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:51,260
to take that thing down.

806
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:53,260
Now champions,

807
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,260
who are your divine beasts?

808
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,260
Show that swirling swine who's boss.

809
01:48:57,260 --> 01:48:59,260
Link will need to meet Ganon head-on

810
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:01,260
when we attack. This needs to be

811
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:03,260
a unified assault.

812
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:05,260
Little guy, you get to Hyrule Castle.

813
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,260
Count on

814
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,260
us for support. But it's up to you

815
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,260
to pound Ganon into oblivion.

816
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:15,779
Come. We should go.

817
01:49:15,779 --> 01:49:17,779
We need to get you someplace safe.

818
01:49:17,779 --> 01:49:23,100
I'm not a child anymore.

819
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:25,100
I didn't- I'm sorry. I may not be much use

820
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:29,130
on the battlefield. There must

821
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:31,130
be something I can do to help.

822
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:51,270
I dragged it over. Cause

823
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:53,699
I have to be on

824
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:55,699
a different input on my monitor.

825
01:49:55,699 --> 01:49:58,649
And I can't see what's actually

826
01:49:58,649 --> 01:50:00,649
on my desktop behind the screen.

827
01:50:00,649 --> 01:50:05,750
That was cool. That was a dramatic

828
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:13,609
moment. It was fine.

829
01:50:13,609 --> 01:50:15,609
There. We'll go facecam off.

830
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:19,829
Live tingle reaction.

831
01:50:19,829 --> 01:50:35,770
Alright, cool. Let's do it.

832
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:41,340
Oh, it's one of these

833
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:44,340
guys. Alright.

834
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:51,060
Okay. Oops.

835
01:50:51,060 --> 01:51:23,239
Where- Stop!

836
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:25,239
For one second! I can't-

837
01:51:25,239 --> 01:51:28,060
What's going on? What are you doing?

838
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:49,670
Shit.

839
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:14,970
I don't even know what direction he is swinging at.

840
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:16,970
Is it vertical or

841
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:29,899
horizontal? I need a shield.

842
01:52:29,899 --> 01:52:33,350
Oh, right. I unequipped my shield.

843
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:35,350
There's a stupid lightning

844
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:37,350
dogshit. And now I can't

845
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,350
parry this dogshit.

846
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:41,350
Okay.

847
01:52:41,350 --> 01:53:12,250
Oh my god. You have a lot of health.

848
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:20,819
Don't!

849
01:53:20,819 --> 01:53:27,350
I need a- Where-

850
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:29,350
Put a weapon on! What's going on?

851
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:34,220
Oh my goodness gracious.

852
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:43,880
What can I even eat?

853
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:50,659
I have to eat all this stuff. I have to.

854
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:53,159
Eat it all. Just eat everything. I don't-

855
01:53:53,159 --> 01:54:09,539
Doesn't matter. Oh, you do that more than

856
01:54:09,539 --> 01:54:17,930
a few times.

857
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:20,739
Oh, that wasn't a swing.

858
01:54:20,739 --> 01:54:23,430
I think I'm dead here.

859
01:54:23,430 --> 01:54:44,739
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

860
01:54:44,739 --> 01:54:54,659
Oh, missed it.

861
01:54:54,659 --> 01:55:10,710
One more hit. Yeah!

862
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:17,539
Very nice. What do I get?

863
01:55:17,539 --> 01:55:25,079
Sword.

864
01:55:25,079 --> 01:55:27,079
Mighty. Lionel. Bow.

865
01:55:27,079 --> 01:55:31,750
Well, I absolutely am getting rid of something.

866
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:34,890
Holy shit. Alright, awesome.

867
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:37,640
What should I get rid of? Golden bow?

868
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:46,920
I feel like this is the worst of all of them.

869
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:52,170
Golden bow. Another lionel shield.

870
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:58,229
I think.

871
01:55:58,229 --> 01:56:01,180
What is better? A knight shield or a lionel shield?

872
01:56:01,180 --> 01:56:15,109
Probably the knight shield, yeah.

873
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:17,109
The lionel shield does damage when you parry.

874
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:26,779
That one's about to break.

875
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:28,779
This one's new though, isn't it?

876
01:56:28,779 --> 01:56:32,300
Drop the old lionel shield.

877
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,859
Actually good idea.

878
01:56:35,859 --> 01:56:37,859
But how much have I used it?

879
01:56:37,859 --> 01:56:58,520
I have used that a lot.

880
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
Sparkle means new.

881
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:13,689
Go back to Impa.

882
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:18,550
Is that all I can do here?

883
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:27,130
Copy. That was part of it, right?

884
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:30,710
Keep going up the mountain.

885
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:32,949
It's kind of chilly here.

886
01:57:34,949 --> 01:57:40,119
Wait, even with the occurence?

887
01:57:40,119 --> 01:57:56,380
I don't think I have anything, do I?

888
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:58,810
Flame sword? Is that enough?

889
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:05,899
No. I don't think I can do this.

890
01:58:05,899 --> 01:58:18,630
I need special armor.

891
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:22,729
That's what I figured. Alright.

892
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:27,079
Sweet. Imagine there's something up here.

893
01:58:27,079 --> 01:58:36,020
There is. Eventually.

894
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:39,859
Where's Impa?

895
01:58:39,859 --> 01:58:49,460
Somebody said go talk to Impa now. Mark it.

896
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:55,220
I don't want to mark this spot right here

897
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:57,220
because I'll be confused how to get there.

898
01:58:57,220 --> 01:58:59,220
How did I get up here?

899
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:03,239
It was through the waterfall.

900
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:07,779
I'll mark it just to...

901
01:59:07,779 --> 01:59:28,250
Leap. Oh shit.

902
01:59:28,250 --> 02:00:03,619
I don't know if that was a quest or not.

903
02:00:03,619 --> 02:00:09,699
Let's turn it in. What do you got for me?

904
02:00:09,699 --> 02:00:12,899
Impa uses a neti pot, do you?

905
02:00:12,899 --> 02:00:16,659
I've used it before, but not in a while.

906
02:00:16,659 --> 02:00:41,420
It kind of feels weird.

907
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:44,170
I'll hand this over to you now before I forget.

908
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:48,250
Champions tunic.

909
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,250
In ancient Hyrule, this garment could only be worn by one

910
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:52,250
and earn the respect of the royal family.

911
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,250
Equipment will reveal an enemy's life gauge.

912
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,250
Wait, don't I already have that?

913
02:00:56,250 --> 02:01:00,789
Doesn't it already show people's health bars?

914
02:01:00,789 --> 02:01:14,680
Exact values.

915
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:27,800
Wait, is it telling me to go kill the divine beasts?

916
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:33,800
I already got three down.

917
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:51,189
Let me see that thing. Five.

918
02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:53,189
If I upgrade this, it's already going to be...

919
02:01:53,189 --> 02:01:56,010
Alright, that's cool. Do I have enough materials to upgrade it?

920
02:01:56,010 --> 02:02:14,420
I don't think I do.

921
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:17,500
Be careful.

922
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,500
You're dressed like a dork right now. I think I look pretty cool.

923
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:28,579
When it's fully upgraded, it's one of the strongest in the game.

924
02:02:28,579 --> 02:02:30,579
Well, alright, I'll keep it for sure.

925
02:02:30,579 --> 02:02:35,640
Alright, I think that's probably a good place to call it.

926
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:39,930
I think this is a good time.

927
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:42,420
11.15. Five hours and some change.

928
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:47,479
I gotta get some food too.

929
02:02:47,479 --> 02:02:52,090
It was a really fun night though.

930
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:55,100
I had a great time.

931
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:57,100
I feel like the vibes were on tonight.

932
02:02:57,100 --> 02:03:01,779
So, it was a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good night.

933
02:03:01,779 --> 02:03:09,720
Do the DLC?

934
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:20,649
Uh, yeah, I mean...

935
02:03:20,649 --> 02:03:22,649
We're just gonna play it. I'll play it just to turn it on.

936
02:03:22,649 --> 02:03:26,220
Then I got really nothing else going on.

937
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:31,590
I think the next thing I really want to do...

938
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:35,500
I did that.

939
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:41,659
I want to at least get this area uncovered.

940
02:03:41,659 --> 02:03:48,760
Because I want the whole map sort of revealed at this point.

941
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,859
At least from here.

942
02:03:52,859 --> 02:04:03,100
Baron is really cool.

943
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:08,020
When are you gonna do no-cam chill streams?

944
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:10,260
Yeah, I feel like they've been a little crazy recently, but...

945
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:17,369
There's been a lot going on.

946
02:04:17,369 --> 02:04:19,369
We'll slow it down a little bit.

947
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:22,250
I said that last week, but I mean it this time.

948
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:26,390
We're gonna hold the, uh...

949
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:35,850
We're gonna put the brakes on.

950
02:04:35,850 --> 02:04:37,850
Yeah, I mean, next stream, I don't know if I'm gonna play Breath of the Wild next.

951
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:40,979
Maybe I will.

952
02:04:40,979 --> 02:04:43,609
Let's say, um... Friday?

953
02:04:43,609 --> 02:04:46,300
Oh, also, uh...

954
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:48,920
Something else I really want to do.

955
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:50,920
I want to do another, like, 80s and 90s commercial watch stream.

956
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:52,920
I feel like people really enjoyed that.

957
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:57,659
I thought that was really fun.

958
02:04:57,659 --> 02:04:59,659
I think we'll probably do that at some point, too.

959
02:04:59,659 --> 02:05:02,979
People have been asking for that again.

960
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:04,979
And I've just kind of been like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

961
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:08,359
Maybe we'll do that, I don't know, at some point this weekend.

962
02:05:08,359 --> 02:05:11,050
Maybe a little bit after this weekend.

963
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:18,220
I'll get it set up.

964
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:20,220
Maybe it launches tomorrow.

965
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:29,239
Ooh, maybe we'll do that on Friday.

966
02:05:29,239 --> 02:05:34,229
Yeah, I still have to watch Ster play Five Nights at Freddy's.

967
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:36,229
But I think we played Roblox for, like, three hours.

968
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:38,229
And I think, uh...

969
02:05:38,229 --> 02:05:47,260
I don't know if we anticipated we were gonna do that.

970
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,260
But yeah, there's a couple games that me and Ster are gonna play at some point, too.

971
02:05:49,260 --> 02:06:01,210
Next week, probably.

972
02:06:01,210 --> 02:06:07,100
More of Roblox.

973
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,100
Roblox is, like, the kind of game that I kinda like.

974
02:06:09,100 --> 02:06:13,770
It's just, you can just jump in a game and who cares?

975
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:16,069
It doesn't even matter.

976
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:18,500
Thirty minutes can go by and you can just leave.

977
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:25,079
Or you can play for, like, two hours.

978
02:06:25,079 --> 02:06:34,680
There's no shame.

979
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:36,680
No, that was great. Thanks again.

980
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:39,750
Big thanks to Poke and obviously Ster.

981
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:41,750
Vibes were immaculate tonight.

982
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:47,579
It was really fun, really funny.

983
02:06:47,579 --> 02:07:01,720
And I'll see you guys on Friday.

984
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:04,279
I don't know exactly what we'll do on Friday.

985
02:07:04,279 --> 02:07:06,279
Anticipate either Resident Evil 4 Mercenaries, maybe Breath of the Wild,

986
02:07:06,279 --> 02:07:08,279
maybe, you know, maybe I might just turn on something random.

987
02:07:08,279 --> 02:07:12,409
Just play it. We'll see.

988
02:07:12,409 --> 02:07:14,409
Friday's stream is gonna be slowed down.

989
02:07:14,409 --> 02:07:17,220
We're gonna chill out.

990
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:19,220
And then at some point, maybe this weekend, we'll do the 80s and 90s ads.

991
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:26,699
See if I can get it set up.

992
02:07:26,699 --> 02:07:43,260
I'll let you know.

993
02:07:43,260 --> 02:08:04,229
Yeah, Hilux 2.

994
02:08:04,229 --> 02:08:06,229
Can we submit videos?

995
02:08:06,229 --> 02:08:09,619
Um, no, I have a lot of compilations that we didn't even see.

996
02:08:09,619 --> 02:08:13,270
So if I ever get to a point where

997
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:17,369
I need more,

998
02:08:17,369 --> 02:08:19,609
which, I don't know how often I do this kind of stuff,

999
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:23,000
so I don't know if I do it at the frequency to need to have

1000
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
a bunch of submissions or something.

1001
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Because it's still a lot that we have not even looked at.

1002
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:38,140
There's the music?

1003
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:43,060
Oh shit, sorry.

1004
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:48,810
Oh well, we're at the end anyways.

1005
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:50,810
Vinnie might have some good playlists, especially for terrible video game ads.

1006
02:08:50,810 --> 02:08:56,310
Yeah, I'll be talking to him soon anyways.

1007
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:58,310
Maybe I'll see if he's got any good ones.

1008
02:08:58,310 --> 02:09:06,760
But yeah, thanks for watching.

1009
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:14,699
Good night, good stream.

1010
02:09:14,699 --> 02:09:17,449
Fun freaking times.

1011
02:09:17,449 --> 02:09:19,449
I'll see you guys on Friday.

1012
02:09:19,449 --> 02:09:21,449
Take care of yourselves. Have a great evening.

1013
02:09:21,449 --> 02:09:23,939
See you this weekend.

1014
02:09:23,939 --> 02:09:25,939
Same time, 6 o'clock Pacific.

1015
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:29,079
Is it standard time?

1016
02:09:29,079 --> 02:09:31,079
Or is it day...

1017
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:33,079
Is it Pacific standard or Pacific daylight time right now?

1018
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:37,579
And I can never keep track, I have no idea.

1019
02:09:37,579 --> 02:09:47,180
Is it PST or PDT right now?

1020
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:55,060
Pacific standard time?

1021
02:09:55,060 --> 02:09:59,100
Yeah, it's PDT.

1022
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,100
Whatever it is.

1023
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:03,979
Alright, I'll see you guys later.

1024
02:10:03,979 --> 02:11:13,739
Take care of yourselves. Good night.
