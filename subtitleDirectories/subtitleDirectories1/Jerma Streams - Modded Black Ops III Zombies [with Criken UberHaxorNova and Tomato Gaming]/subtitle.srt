00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:13,720
Hi guys, welcome to an Omega Lake stream. You were here earlier, I had to change a few things,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,760
because we have some interesting things going on tonight. There's always something interesting

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,469
going on. There's always something, always something different, you know, always something

4
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:41,140
new going on here. Am I using a webcam, Mike? Am I? Hold on. Hello? Hello? Are we good?

5
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,969
What Mike was that? I don't know what Mike that was. Okay, well, anyways, hi. Welcome to

6
00:00:50,969 --> 00:01:00,759

7
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:08,329
here? I have no idea. So let's go over a couple things. I'm not going to tweet this out yet.

8
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,340
I want to make sure that the stream is going to be stable, because I'm currently downloading

9
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,560
hundreds of gigabytes worth of data. And we'll explain it. We'll talk about it.

10
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Somebody just gave speaking of hundreds, thinking of hundreds of gigabytes of data.

11
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:44,599
Somebody just give $200. That was German's massive dong for two,

12
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,219
$200, 20,000 bits. They're just given they're just given hundreds of dollars.

13
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,060
This this is just still happening right now, by the way, like this is another

14
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,620
hundred dollars just came in 300 bucks. This isn't I don't even know how to react. This is insane

15
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,530
to read. This is 300 bucks right at the beginning from German's massive dong. Well,

16
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:21,530
he gave it to himself. I didn't. I didn't. But thank you so much for the 300 fucking dollars.

17
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,849
They say I love you, Jeremy. You're the best been watching you since before the TF2

19
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:46,939

20
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,689
after that gigantic blast out of money. One night, why don't I tell you myself?

21
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:07,580
How you doing? Okay, anyways, so let me make sure one thing happens here.

22
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:19,449
Okay. Am I delayed? I might be. Did it again. Why did you do it again? That that's that's $400.

23
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:28,120
400 from German's massive dong. Okay, this is where it gets a little weird.

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,189
This is another one. They say take all of my money. Take it all. I don't want to take all

25
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:45,509
your money. I don't want to take all your money. That's 500 bucks. Take it all. Take

26
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:51,669

27
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,750

52
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,040
or a bad stream. This might be a middle of the road stream. This might be a great stream.

53
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:08,870
I don't know. I can't. That's $750. That's outrageous. What was I saying? Oh yeah.

56
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:47,429

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,259

00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,299

68
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,710
Kraken and Nova. I didn't even tell you about this guy spoiled. I mean, I just spoiled it for you.

69
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,019

70
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:40,009
done in 11 minutes. I said I would give all my money the second the stream started

71
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,850
German's massive dong and you're over $1,000 and I don't know why you do that. I don't

72
00:10:45,850 --> 00:11:01,659
know what to do. This is insane. You don't have to give me all your money. That is

73
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:23,269
$1,005. No, $1,050, right? I forgot how to stream. I forgot how to stream.

74
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:33,159
I don't remember how to do this. Okay. So first of all, thanks for the thousand,

75
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:38,360
$1,000 shut the closet. Okay. No, I can't get up because I have like a fucking weird

76
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,759
pants on and I don't want you to see anything. I swear to God, that's the truth. Five

77
00:11:42,759 --> 00:12:06,649
community subs from loco roco. I haven't been able to even say anything. That's another

78
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:12,330
1100 bucks. How do I stop? How do I turn it off? I'm turning off bits. How do I turn off this?

79
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:18,600
I swear to God, I don't know what to do is I'm overwhelmed right now. I'm so overwhelmed.

80
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,940
Who is this guy? Oh, obviously it's it's German's massive dong. But you hold on,

81
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:42,629
you got to stop though. You've got to stop it at the 1000 bits per inch, right? No,

83
00:12:53,419 --> 00:13:04,419
No, no, that's not what I meant. I mean, you'd be able to put out fires with that thing.

84
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,500
All right. Okay. Now I'm all fucked up. I don't know. I'm done. Just show us the dog.

85
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,659
Oh my God, dude. 12. I cannot fucking believe that I just got over $1,200 from the same

86
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:23,179
person. And then other people will cut like this is there. Okay, there you go. That's that's

87
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,899
$1,200 for 12. You do the math. I'm not I'm not one of those streamers. I'm not going to go

88
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:38,519
there. Okay. Anyways, my God, this is fucking ridiculous. German's massive dog. Thank you

89
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:48,009

90
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,009
now? Why am I going to make this much money right now? I didn't even do anything.

91
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:05,220
Well, now I'm going to immediately order the wireless vibe set thing. Time to retire.

92
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:18,279
Holy shit. It's just a dream. Like wake up in my bed. But for real, though, like,

93
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,240
completely unnecessary. But thank you fucking so much for the insane uncountable dog money.

94
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:35,320
And that Peter P 337 are 100 bucks. He just said party. So fucking much. This is insanity.

95
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:46,070
Thank you. That's his name. That's the person's name. Anyways, this is what's happening today.

96
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,789
We're gonna hang out. I'm currently downloading a bunch of mods. Let's go over it. Let's go

97
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,029
over the week. We're just gonna hang out. We got like 40 minutes until, like I said,

98
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:01,590
Kraken Nova and tomato. We're gonna do something. And what that is, I'll tell you

99
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:13,779
after I collect myself. Yes, I had the title of the stream is already here. I'm off.

100
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,779
Anyways, okay, here we go. Let's get a sip of coffee. Let's fucking ground ourselves here.

101
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:41,029
Let me ground myself. Let me ground myself with like a clear quartz crystal. That's quartz.

102
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:51,340
It looks pretty. This is this is quartz. Let me ground myself. What's that supposed to do?

103
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:59,779
Why do I have that? Because I got Kim a ring the other day. No, no, not what you think.

104
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,820
Not what you're thinking. We just were like, we will. No, listen, I got, it was just

105
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,019
like a fun ring and like it was a crystal ring. And I was like, oh, it looked cool. Listen to me.

106
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:19,460
All right. Another hundred dollars just came in. No, we're not. Who are characters of these? Have

107
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,899
you ever seen them before? I don't know what these are. My stream is lagging. Too much

108
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:28,759
money has come in. Just kidding. The love never stops. Thank you, Jermis. Massive dong.

109
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:46,139
But anyways, another 13 hundred five. Sometimes I think this isn't even real.

110
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:55,259
You know what I mean? I'm going to wake up in like a week or like a month or something.

111
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:59,580
And I'm going to be like 14 just in bed. And this is just a wild fucking like 10 year,

112
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:12,069
15 year long dream. You ever think about that? You are always, this is the, this is the,

113
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,269
this is the point of money where like you went over that, that threshold of like,

114
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:22,630
that's a lot. And then you went over it again. It's like the bar is here and it's just over

115
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:28,650
there and I can't, I can't see it anymore. It's 1400 dollars from Jermis massive dong.

116
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:39,859
I have to say it every time. Buy a ring here. Buy a ring with all my money. It wasn't an

117
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,859
expensive ring. It was just a fun thing for fun. We were looking around at some stores and

118
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:49,640
stuff. Turtle toenail. Another 50 dollars. Let's not forget about the other people that

119
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,759
have given more than 50 hundred dollars in the first 10. This was supposed to,

120
00:17:52,839 --> 00:18:01,099
we are just kind of hanging out, I guess. My goodness gracious. No stream, just bits.

121
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:04,940
Been watching you for years. This is my first live stream. Well, welcome. Thanks for hanging

122
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,779
out. Eventually I will tell you what we're doing tonight. I bought her a candy ring. Yeah,

123
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:25,460
made it a candy. Twerk on stream. Why would I do that? But anyways, so we were going to

124
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:34,380
play. I got to reset. I can turn the stream off and turn it back on. Hold on. Let me

125
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:59,859
reset. I got to reset. I have to reset. Okay, we reset. Welcome to the stream, everybody.

126
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:07,859
No, he did it again. A streamer makes a million dollars doing that. You're not going

127
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,339
to give a million dollars. Do not fucking even think, don't even, I don't know if that's

128
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:20,009
real. You could be being a fucking weirdo. Though do not give a million dollars. I'm not

129
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:28,420
very good with money. Don't give it to me. Don't give it to me. It'll never work again.

130
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,640
I make a million dollars tonight and I'm like, well, all right. That was like fun for like

131
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:46,710
the last 10 years. I'm going to go live on a beach. I'm just going to just permanently

132
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:51,819
lie down in the sand and have like a beer right here. And I'm going to do it so often

133
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:56,700
that I'm going to have like a permanent sunburn, vacation beer sunburn here. It's

134
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:14,279
going to be like a tattoo. I was going to tell you what we were doing today.

135
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:42,869
What am I supposed to do? Dude, what the fuck are you doing? That's $1,600. What did

136
00:20:42,869 --> 00:21:09,220
you say? You best stream for the rest of your life until you die. I can't stream

137
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,619
anymore. Is this what happens? Is this what happens when you get like too much money?

138
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:27,660
You're just like, um, so what we're going to, hey, what we're going to do today,

139
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,859
let me tell you, it's really cool stuff that what's going on. Uh, so what we're

140
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:40,650
doing today is, uh, it's something very cool. We're going to play, listen, so, uh, my,

141
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:47,740
my mother is coming in. All right. So my mother's coming in next week.

142
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,970
So I'm going to spend the next few days here in rural streaming. So those of you

143
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:01,190
know that I'm taking a little vacation next week. One bit equals minus one brain cell.

144
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,660
Okay. Give, look, give me, give me a little credit here. So I'm just sitting here in my office,

145
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,349
right? And I'm like, Hey, let me get started with something here. Hold on. Oh, let's get

146
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:19,559
started. Hey guys, welcome. Somebody opens the door and they have a briefcase. And I don't,

147
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,640
I don't know. I'm just like, Hey, and by the way, this person has a sign on them that says

148
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,460
German has a huge dick. And I'm like, well, hey, huge, all right, what's, what's the

149
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,420
briefcase? What is this? And he like, and he walks out of the room and I open up this

150
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,390
briefcase and there's two grand in here. And it's like, what this, what's in here?

151
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,140
There's $2,000 in here. I'm trying. It's, um, this is fucking ridiculous.

152
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,660
He brings in $1,600 briefcase. Yeah. Okay. He just walks in with it with another

153
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,619
briefcase. Five minutes later, there's another a hundred dollar bill of it.

154
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:11,210
He does that 16 times and he walks in every time he goes like,

155
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:23,269
and it's like, yeah, like a German's dick. Oh my God. All right. That they said, this is

156
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,089
another a hundred bucks. Derma, I'm done. Give it money for now. But seriously,

157
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,890
your videos and streams got me through some hard times that I could never gotten

158
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,250
through without you. Just want to say thank you for being used so much. Love a fellow

159
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:46,099
gamer. That's, that's all you needed to say. Seriously. That's it. You don't have to give

160
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:53,109
me fucking 1700 bucks, but that's a, that money will be spent on candy. I buy a lot of

161
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:58,230
chocolates. I buy a lot of Reese's. Uh, but for real, that's so much fucking money.

162
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:05,380
I, I have nothing else to say besides I am fucking forever grateful that you would

163
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,099
even consider even thinking for a second that some random guy on the internet deserves

164
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,299
almost $2,000 of your money and I can't even fucking comprehend it.

165
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,349
Thank you so much for being part of the community. That's, that's fucking intense,

166
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:26,200
man. Like I, I really, really hope that you can afford it. Number one. And I'm just glad that

167
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:35,029
you have fun here. That's all I care about. So I will put that money to good use. You just,

168
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:42,740
you just yourself pretty much bought like the dunk tank spring. Yeah. There it is. Like

169
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:53,930
seriously, uh, moving on from that though, I, I'm forever grateful. Thank you. Oh yeah,

170
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,289
that's right. I thought I didn't like talk about that yet. I talked about a little bit

171
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:02,569
at the end of the stream. Uh, you'll see it whenever someday. But anyways, um, after that

172
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:15,940
monumental amount of fucking money, what we're doing today. Hey, how are you talking to you?

173
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:22,539
How you been? He's going to say it. He's finally going to say it. He's going to tell

174
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:30,390
us what we're doing today is I originally planned. So we were VR last night. I wanted

175
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:36,980
today to be kind of a chill stream. So around like, I don't know, three o'clock,

176
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,670
I was going to just play, um, what's that video game Western? Call of Juarez, right? We're

177
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:54,140
going to play Call of Juarez. We're going to play Call of Juarez. But it turned out that,

178
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,880
uh, Criken sent me a message and he said, Hey, we've got some shit going on. If you want

179
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,930
to play, we're going to do like black ops, three zombies modded. And I was like,

180
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:10,650
all right, that sounds like fun, but they don't start streaming till like 20, 30

181
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:14,869
minutes from now. So what I kind of had to push the stream back a little bit.

182
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,789
It was like kind of last minute, not even like 24 hours, really 12 hours or so.

183
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:25,670
So I thought it'd be fun. We're going to do extreme modded black ops three.

184
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:44,619
There's like 50 mods, Jervis dong is average. Why people are given more.

185
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:53,109
So before I address the more penis money that came in the dong money that came in,

186
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:14,390
this is like surgeon income right now. Do you understand? This is like, I should be

187
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:28,730
performing like a heart surgery. I've lost. Okay, hold on. But listen, so yesterday VR,

188
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,450
I was going to chill a little bit today, but we're going to do another high octane

189
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:37,349
stream today. Crazy black ops three modded nonsense. It was like a hundred and 200,

190
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:39,589
300 gigs worth of stuff. I can't, I don't know what the fuck it's going to be. It's

191
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,630
going to be insane. That's happening very soon. We're just going to hang out till then

192
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,710
tomorrow. Carl Juarez might beat the whole game. I don't know. Might not might

193
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,269
give up halfway through. It might be the whole thing Friday. That's right. Going four days in

194
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,670
a row, four days in a row of streams here. Friday after like six o'clock. Cause I have,

195
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:01,720
I've got an appointment that I have to do. So Friday at like five, six plus o'clock,

196
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,000
just going to turn it off and we're going to hang out and have fun about appointment.

197
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,619
So we're going to do four days in a row because after Friday, I'm going to be gone

198
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:28,140
for a little under a week. My mother's coming in, you know, got to hang out with my mother.

199
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:36,099
It's been like seven months, which Carl Juarez gunslinger tried to play it a long time ago

200
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:46,339
and it just didn't work out, but I will be gone from Saturday ish all the way through

201
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:52,019
into like potentially Thursday, like Wednesday to Thursday depending. So I'll be gone for

202
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:58,329
about five days straight. Give or take. I'll let you know. He still hasn't started to

203
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:03,700
play the game. I have to wait. I have to wait for criken and Nova. They don't start for like

204
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,710
another 20 minutes. So we're just hanging out to begin with. Why is this so laggy?

205
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:23,049
You see that? It shouldn't be laggy like this. There we go. Okay.

206
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,990
I think we were going to set up a little. I have everything installed now.

207
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,539
Let me just get in there and see if it worked. Dude, they're already playing it.

208
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:43,180
Imagine if they like, like the lie to me. Imagine they're like, yeah, they get it.

209
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,619
It's like a bunch of, it's a bunch of gigs and I'm like, oh yeah,

210
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,259
gigs and I download all this shit and they just like stop playing without me

211
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:58,069
and they just pretend I'm like not here, but we had before I'm going to open up the game.

212
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:01,109
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of stalling and a lot of money came in and

213
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,200
you guys are fucking too much. Thank you. Turtle toenail $50. Stop talking about the

214
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,200
stream. What? Dermis dong is average. Thank you Magellan. Thanks for the $50.

215
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,079
Fine. You got me take my money for real though. Forever grateful for your content

216
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,470
and we'll forever will be. I'm forever grateful for the fact that you're watching and you're

217
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,650
here. So I, you guys have made my literally my dreams of like when I was 12 come true.

218
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:35,480
So thank you for that. That the counter is all fucked up. It's going to be broken for like

219
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,430
the next 30 minutes. Everything I've ever wanted to do in my life. It's like what I,

220
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,470
what you guys are fulfilling that dream. So I have you to thank for that one.

221
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:53,849
But let's open it up. Let me get out of here. Let me open up black ops.

222
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,589
I haven't never even played this before guys. I don't even know how to play zombies.

223
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:04,980
This is, I'm going to be such a piece of crap to stream. I've never played a game of zombies in

224
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:23,690
my life, but thank you so much again to Dermis massive dong. You are too fucking generous.

225
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:35,609
All right. Let's open this up. Black ops three might be loud. Hope it's not loud.

226
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:39,259
Yeah. They're going to have to give me like a crash course in this game.

227
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:45,220
Cause I have no idea how to play it. Play online multiplayer to warm up.

228
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:54,519
I think Kraken is in like the streaming channel. I wonder what that means.

229
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:08,309
Imagine thanking your own dong. I know it's weird. Yeah. But how could I warm up?

230
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:11,190
No, does anybody play black ops? I thought there was like a joke.

231
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:26,329
No, I don't. How do I turn off the discord overlay? There we go.

232
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:29,450
Yeah. Wasn't there a meme before that like only like eight people had this on PC or

233
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:40,890
something. I hear this. Why would this be coming through my Ben Q monitor? What the fuck?

234
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:46,819
We saw that you had a Ben Q monitor plugged in. You wanted to come through the non-speakers.

235
00:32:47,460 --> 00:33:03,299
There we go. So let's get this captured. It's a PC game. That sure is. Hey, there we go. Look at

236
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:12,420
that. Hey, do you want to open the store? Oh, Kraken. There is this Kraken. Hey, Kraken,

237
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,500
Kraken, can you hear me? Kraken. Oh, you can't hear me. Oh no. He has AirPods in. Kraken.

238
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:29,660
I hope I downloaded all this shit right. It wasn't three. It was way more than three.

239
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:46,759
Hold on a second. Wait a second. Wait a minute. Hold on. It was like 50.

240
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:52,819
Why are you just downloading? No, no, I have, I should have them all. I downloaded them. Dude,

241
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:58,230
it took like two hours to download all these. What was that? It was just fucking.

242
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:14,739
Maps only show up in zombies. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. That's the default sound. I'm such

243
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:21,320
a bad streamer. Is there any way I can make sure that I'm like subscribed to these? Let me see.

244
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,670
It says I'm subscribed to all of them. Should I go? Is Kraken streaming right now?

245
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:33,139
Yeah, it says I have them all. All right. I think I just panicked for no reason.

246
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:54,539
The first 35 minutes of the stream. My God. All right. Here we go. Let me get my

247
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:08,949
settings correct. Should be starting very soon here. Stop giving yourselves a bunch of donations.

248
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,380
Treyarch. I'm surprised I actually have Call of Duty installed.

249
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:35,460
Re-chat. Re-chat. I'm trying to set up a video game. 2015? Oh, that's right. They make,

250
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,420
they made so many of these that I forget that they come out like every eight months.

251
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:45,530
Okay. Let's go to, I want to chat. Party privacy. I don't know what the fuck that means.

252
00:35:46,090 --> 00:36:06,170
Oh, where's this? Where's this settings? Oh, oh, that, oh, all right. Is there a settings?

253
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:20,619
Media options. What, what kind of menu is this? Did enough $50 come in? Multiplayer. All right.

254
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm going to, let's get this down a little. Voice volume. It looks good. I can turn this

255
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,300
up. I want to turn, let me, cinematics. Somebody wants to hear that. Subtitles on.

256
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:40,619
Multiplayer music. Multiplayer dialogue. That's because it's Xbox. Okay. Graphics.

257
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:49,179
Yeah, this is what I want. Windowed full screen. Yeah. RGB. Field of view. Excuse me.

258
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,559
How dare you make that default at 80. Max frame to second. Sync every frame. That's

259
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:09,050
not what I want, right? Okay. That's better. Subtitles still off. That's all right.

260
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:17,530
All right. Extra quality. Stop the bits. No, this is, okay, look, I'll do this.

261
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:25,510
Those are all late coming in. You can tell the money's just going right to his fucking head.

262
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Game player name. What? What? Full name. I don't want the people's full names.

263
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:53,340
It's your player name. Oh, okay. All right. I think, I think I'm ready to,

264
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,150
I think I'm ready to go. Should I go in here and just scream at Kraigen?

265
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:08,260
Turn off motion blur. Oh, yeah, that's right. Off. Disabled. Ambient occlusion. I don't think so.

266
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,260
Dynamic shadow of this. Some of these are dumb, right? Which one of these is the dumb one?

267
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:27,420
I know there's at least two or three dumb ones. Extra? No, this is dumb. I don't want

268
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,500
any of these to be on it like that high because we're doing fucked up mods. They're

269
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:42,980
going to run like shit. AO is the dumb one. Oh, okay. All right. Let's see if I fucking

270
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,019
get in here and see what he says. All right. Let's see if we can pull them in.

271
00:38:51,929 --> 00:39:03,510
Hello. Hello. Hey. Hey, how are you? Hey, how are you, man?

272
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:08,070
This is the, so everyone in here is currently screaming? This is the waiting room. Yeah. I'm

273
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,070
actually about to deafen, but uh. Oh, okay. Cool. Hey, yeah. This is the, this is the place

274
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:18,019
to be. Yeah. I'm live right now. I'll be back in like, oh, oh, say something, say,

275
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:26,679
quit, say something, say something. I'm fucking alone. That was tomato, by the way. All right.

276
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:32,219
So just, it's just me in here. Nope. Don't go into the auto chest room. What? All right. Here

277
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:50,519
we go. All right. So I said I was streaming and I scared him. All right. So what can I,

278
00:39:50,519 --> 00:40:02,650
what can I do? How do, what do I do? What do I do? I've just set up, I gotta get camera,

279
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:10,949
put the camera back on. Everyone loves a cam, right? I'm not going to play the campaign.

280
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:28,409
Spend my COD points? I have 200. What does that get me? What? This is a Captain America

281
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:45,539
t-shirt, guys. What are you talking about? Home Star Runner. It could be that too.

282
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:58,199
We're going to get started real soon here. What the fuck? Open a loot crate? No,

283
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,480
because I don't want you guys, wasn't there a thing where if you opened up a loot crate,

284
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,079
somebody else could watch you opening loot crates? Was that this game or was that a

285
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:23,610
different one? Dong's account is gone? Oh Jesus. Well, I, I, I don't know what to say. I don't

286
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:32,460
know what to do. I guess we'll just see how that plays out. But I snapped him. No, I didn't.

287
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,909
Well, I don't know what happened to that, but I, I don't have much else to say, you know,

288
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:58,980
that it was fucking an insane amount of money. Kraken's playing? I'm in the streaming

289
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,340
channel right now with Kraken and he's muted and he's deafened. He's doing an introduction.

290
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,920
That's what I've been doing. This is just the guys. This is the introduction. This is my

291
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:34,630
43 minute introduction. Fix my sleeve. Where? What? What is wrong with you guys? What? What?

292
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:50,860
Fix your, what the fuck? Like that is like tiny sleeves. I know this is like a look.

293
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,500
You want to see how you make yourself look like a baby? Ready? Like I got like big

294
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:03,059
fucking shoulders, right? Kraken sent you the collection, right? Yeah. I got it all

295
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:10,900
downloaded, all installed. I hope it was 800 gigabytes. I'm going to assume. It was insane.

296
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:17,539
I couldn't believe it. Every, almost every map in that thing is worth about two gigs a pop.

297
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:24,389
I don't know why. Dude, it was like, I was telling my chat earlier before he started,

298
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:28,230
it was like I was taking buckets of water and like dumping them out of a sinking ship.

299
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:33,590
I had to, I was just uninstalling things as it was going. Yeah. That's I mean, think about

300
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,789
like this. I've had this shit on my computer for probably like the last two weeks when we've been

301
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:44,469
planning on doing this again. So I've been watching this like tumor on my drive just getting

302
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:49,829
bigger and bigger. Oh my God. It's going to be insane when it's all removed. Yeah. I mean,

303
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:53,030
honestly, half the stuff, I never cleaned up this collection from the last time we did it

304
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,070
because we never got through all of it. Yeah. So like there's like, it's like 50% trash and

305
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:03,349
other 50% like actual levels and about 50% of that is stuff we've already done. So it's actually

306
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,110
just like, all right. So how do I know if I have this installed correctly? Cause it's,

307
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:13,989
is there with me to like see it? Yeah. If you're on zombies, hang on. I'm logging in

308
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:17,590
as well. The easiest way is just to like join, like go into the game personally, like

309
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,789
a private zombies level. Okay. So like private game. Yeah. And just grab like Minecraft or

310
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:31,909
something, man. All right. So like change map. Yeah. Okay. I see like star wars, Minecraft,

311
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:39,750
just grab one song. Hey, don't look too much. Wait, what the fuck are these? Don't. Hey.

312
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:46,730
All right. Just grab one. This 70 files here. Hey, all right. Just grab one, launch it up

313
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,769
and see if you like what you see or if at least what did it? Oh my God. All right. I'm

314
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:55,769
going to try. I'm going to try to launch. You said Minecraft. I'm going to just see

315
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:05,500
if it launches. Get a Minecraft one. We're probably going to start with monopoly again,

316
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,539
though. Why did your voice do that? Huh? I forgot. It's a, it's a, it's an

317
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:13,739
Activision game. It just makes everybody's voice a thousand times louder. Doesn't it?

318
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:25,219
Oh fuck. Wait, did I do that? Was it you? Wait, was it me or you? Hello. Hey. Hey,

319
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:31,139
there's the guy. How you been? I've been great. How are you? I'm doing great. Sorry.

320
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,139
Wait in here in this room for a bit. Are you okay? No, we're good. We're good.

321
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:40,340
I'm just hanging out. Just being a weirdo. Yeah. My microphone. Oh God, it does.

322
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,019
Craig, you gotta be careful. It does things. Oh, it boosts your mic. Yep. Oh yeah. I just

323
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:50,579
watched it. I watched it at normal volume. The second I unmuted to tell you guys that

324
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:55,860
it didn't boost, it boosted to 100. So I remember. Yeah. Okay. So, uh,

325
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,619
Jermo, would you prefer me to call you Jeremy or Jermo? I don't want to.

326
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:04,179
You can call me anything you want. Anything you want. All right. As long as it's, it's,

327
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:09,139
it's makes sense. Germ town. How about that? Yeah, that's good. So I'll get the map. The

328
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:13,940
map works. Cool. Well, which map? Oh, you guys are testing out one. I just had him,

329
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,340
I just had him pick a random one from the collection because we can assume as long as,

330
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,260
as long as his drive wasn't full when he tried to install it. I mean, we'll see,

331
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,460
because it sounds like you're deleting as I was doing that. I was deleting as I was coming in.

332
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,539
I've been like laying down the tracks. It was like 10 gigs a second. It was like,

333
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:36,340
I mean, I bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. I was doing a Jerma, but like the issue is that I

334
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,539
didn't go through the collection Kraken from last time to get rid of the stuff that we did

335
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:43,619
and wouldn't go back to. So it's all just like still. Yeah, it's all just this messy.

336
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,219
At this point, I mean, we forgot most of the shit we did last time. So I'll probably

337
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:50,820
just like grab like stuff that still looks interesting or shit. And we'll skip the shit

338
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:59,179
that I know was complete irrevocable garbage, you know, the pseudo voodoo one was never going

339
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:03,739
to play that. No, yeah, that one was fucked, dude. I couldn't find another one that was like

340
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:08,139
that. Like that was really their Pokemon that you're better zombies. There's there's nothing

341
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:11,260
else. No, there's definitely some weird ones. I went, I did like a little,

342
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,139
there's one where you fight against rats and I think you're supposed to be cats. I think

343
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:19,340
I got that one. OK, there's one like TOS violations in this, like 70.

344
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:26,539
Well, there's a game of Thrones one because I had to. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's topical, dude.

345
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:31,989
That's gonna be great. I know exactly who do you think I am? Yeah, we're you know,

346
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,510
we're all about the clickbait here. We're just trying to capitalize on those trends.

347
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,610
Months. Why we're playing this Black Ops 3. I was surprised with Black Ops 3.

348
00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:46,250
Didn't Black Ops like seven come out like last week? Yeah, but this is for some reason,

349
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:52,889
we're all surprised to manage to con you into joining. Yeah, it was literally like just like

350
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:58,420
today. It was just like, do you want to do this? And I'm like, yeah, yeah.

351
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,139
Yeah, I'll spend 60 bucks on Black Ops 3. Every other person we messaged to play this

352
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:09,210
actually like, yeah, everyone else said no. So thank you guys for there's no, you know,

353
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,090
there's no reason for that. You'll have a great time. I'll tell you that much.

354
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,889
Let's see. Well, we'll make it fun. That'll be fun. Have you what? Have you met James,

355
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:23,079
by the way, over half Xenova? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hello. Welcome. Sorry, I was muted.

356
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:31,510
Where's this bit? It's a bit. What happened to you, buddy? What do you mean? Are you on

357
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:38,119
pain meds or something? This is my voice. I'm fucked up. It's a little weird and loud. No.

358
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:47,639
Ah, hold on one sec. No, is it? No, it's definitely addressed. Why is it pitched up?

359
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,500
All right. I'm like having to like on the fly change everyone's audio levels.

360
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,860
They're fucking. Yeah, everyone. When you turn on Black Ops, like have your

361
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,420
microphone properties open this whole stream. Oh, yeah. Fun, fun bit. Some of these maps

362
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,420
will crash you not for any of our fault, but just because they're bad. And when that

363
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:12,500
happens, the game will auto boost your mic to 100 again. So it's like an added fucking

364
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,340
slap in the face. Also, full disclosure to cover my own ass. I personally don't have the time to

365
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,340
vet all these levels. So whatever we see in there is basically the extent of me scrolling

366
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,659
to the comments and seeing if anyone yelled, holy shit, how'd this get on? Yeah. So, yeah.

367
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,389
A button prepared for this one. I'm going to get a little bit of a scene change,

368
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:39,769
ready for this. Last time wasn't so bad. We played Monopoly. We played Minecraft.

369
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,409
Is it working now? Oh, you're great.

370
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:52,920
Except for the. Oh, Jesus. What? What's going on, man? What did you do to your mixer?

371
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,960
I don't know. What's wrong with it? You're fucking 13.

372
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,900
This is this is. It started. It's not a bit. What's wrong with my voice? Dude,

373
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:09,139
I've heard you in real life. This is not your voice. What's it? That laugh was on the fly.

374
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,539
What kind of computer you have hooked up? Yeah. I don't know how that computer works.

375
00:50:13,539 --> 00:50:17,860
Wait, can you guys still hear me? Yes. Oh, my God. It's discord, dude.

376
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,110
I closed discord, but it's still up. It's like a ghost. Oh, God. Yeah.

377
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:29,510
I don't recognize this person. It's really, it's fucking me up. By the way, I sent you guys

378
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:35,429
a squad invite, the new Twitch squad. Why don't you do that? Oh, wait. Oh, yeah. Does that work?

379
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,150
Oh, no, no. I tried the other day. Actually, this does it. Let's try it.

380
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,730
So is there there's a squat. Oh, I see invite to the squad.

381
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,650
And then people can, you know, watch all the chats and watch all the perspectives.

382
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:55,769
And it's meant to be like a big happy family. I just hurt my mouth. How?

383
00:50:57,849 --> 00:51:00,250
You invited me and I clicked on it. It hurt my fucking mouth.

384
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,010
I'm sorry. No, I just like I opened my jaw really fast.

385
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,289
It was too bad because you're excited about the invite or what?

386
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,650
Yeah, I just saw the invite. I like I pogged myself to death.

387
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:14,619
We can't hear James anymore. So if he's

388
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:21,079
having the one time with spoon. What the fuck? Hello? Yeah.

389
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,639
How are you still in the call? Is it good? No. What the fuck, dude?

390
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,559
I think it's starting to grow on me, though. Yeah, I kind of like this new James.

391
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:36,039
It's getting worse. I don't know how to say it.

392
00:51:36,039 --> 00:51:38,360
It's definitely getting worse by the minute. It's getting higher.

393
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:43,030
Like a high wine. Oh, he's gone. All right.

394
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:45,429
Hopefully he's fixed it. This is fucking hilarious.

395
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:48,710
OK, so we get like in a team or something. Yeah, I'm making a lot.

396
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,550
Let's get in it. Let's get in the team. Do you ever play Black Ops 3?

397
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,110
Never. I've never even opened it. I don't even know how to play zombies.

398
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:58,710
I've never even opened it. Oh, great. All right, cool.

399
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,110
I played like the original Black Ops. I don't think I ever played

400
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,309
until we did this like a couple of months ago.

401
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,949
Yeah, another saw map by that tomato because that was that was inspired.

402
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:11,590
Yeah, we can grab them. You know how like those people

403
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,349
like didn't respond or they didn't want to do it.

404
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:16,630
And like I did. I probably should have been one of those people that said no,

405
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,429
because I've never played zombies before in my life.

406
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,030
Oh, God. I know the basics.

407
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,989
Run in a circle and a crowd of people run behind you.

408
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:29,800
Yeah. Except, yeah, that's it. I figured it out.

409
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,079
Some of the some of these maps also have additional objectives.

410
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:38,679
Like I think one had us in Minecraft forge a diamond sword,

411
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:40,199
which would let us progress in the level.

412
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:49,940
We had one I saw was Black Ops for you where so it's like I guess there's many games.

413
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,739
I don't really know how that's going to work, but this is going to be so odd.

414
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:55,219
Yeah, no, we don't know what we're getting into.

415
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:58,659
That's the whole that's the whole point. It's like it's like through let wheel.

416
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,039
Cool. Oh, my God.

417
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:06,280
I opened up my my Black Ops mod folder and it's this barren wasteland

418
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,559
because the folder is somehow full even though it's not.

419
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,000
Craig, you might have to do the first level without me.

420
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:15,480
All right. Are we going to invite you?

421
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,280
I do like I'll give you the name of one of them.

422
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,679
OK. Hello. You sound good now.

423
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:24,340
I'm good. No, no, no.

424
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,460
No, no. Are you serious?

425
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,179
It's you started all right. And then it was like, no.

426
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:33,349
Yeah. What the fuck is weird?

427
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:37,670
I was I was told to like deactivate my mic before and that should have fixed it.

428
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:39,989
This is crazy. Other people have had this before.

429
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:42,309
I don't know how they fixed it. This is totally intentional.

430
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:44,469
I can't I can't believe it's not intentional.

431
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:48,250
Now it's getting a little bit to the length where it can't be intentional.

432
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:50,570
Any better? Or is it still the same?

433
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,769
There it is. Oh, here.

434
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:55,179
Yeah. Yeah, you're fixed.

435
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:56,139
Legit. Yeah.

436
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:57,500
Yeah, you sound good. Great.

437
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,860
All I did was disable it and re enable it again.

438
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,219
Well, there you go. That's all it takes.

439
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:04,780
That's why turning it off and turning it back on.

440
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,860
Oh, yeah, dude. That's what I said.

441
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,260
Unplug and plug it back in.

442
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,619
Hot take one bikini bottom.

443
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:13,260
A spongebob zombies want cheese cube three.

444
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:13,820
Do you want dead?

445
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,980
Dude, how many fucking maps did you make me download?

446
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:20,059
There was it took me like two hours to fucking go over.

447
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,820
Yeah. Do you want Cobra Kai?

448
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,780
Do you want farm?

449
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,500
Do you want to see? I told you guys.

450
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:26,699
Minecraft.

451
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:29,019
I told everybody that last time I was making it up.

452
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,340
I picked multiple Minecraft levels.

453
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,500
I grabbed a lot because I knew I knew this might happen.

454
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,579
OK, this one's called Minecraft, like the fucking German like nine.

455
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:40,940
Oh, yeah, try that one.

456
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,579
That looks bad.

457
00:54:42,539 --> 00:54:44,860
I mean, I told you I didn't vet any of these, but sure.

458
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,219
Yeah, let's hope this is good.

459
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,860
Get your get your get your scene change ready for real.

460
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,619
And wait, what do I have to do?

461
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,820
Why do I have to do that?

462
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,119
Do we have to like cut the black screen or something?

463
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:57,239
I didn't hear you guys.

464
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:59,880
No, I don't think it's ever going to get to that level.

465
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,960
It probably won't be to us.

466
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,800
I can't imagine any of those.

467
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,159
Like all these levels aren't ones.

468
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:08,360
These are all ones that people have played and voted for.

469
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,199
And there's titties in it to some extent.

470
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:12,119
Oh, yeah, you know, but we can't.

471
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:12,440
What?

472
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,800
I'm not saying there's not titties.

473
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,679
You could get titties in a fucking zombies map.

474
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:17,639
Dude, these are all modded.

475
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:23,139
Mod map makers are historically just the strangest people in the world.

476
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,699
Why didn't you just download the fucking titty ones then?

477
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:27,139
We may have.

478
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:29,139
You know, it's part of the excitement.

479
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:30,980
It's like you never know if you're going to get titties or not.

480
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,139
Why did I agree to this?

481
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,659
This could have been playing Call of Juarez right now.

482
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,340
I'm ready.

483
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,940
All right, I'm going to invite you.

484
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:45,139
Yeah, you guys do the first one without me while I power download the last of these maps

485
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:47,539
and I'll join for the next one.

486
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:48,179
So we're going to start.

487
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:48,980
Do I have you guys on here?

488
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,340
Did you invite on Steam?

489
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,110
Did I make it in?

490
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:53,349
Let's see.

491
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,510
It says you're not in the game.

492
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:56,809
Me?

493
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,250
No, not Jerma.

494
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,809
I don't know about...

495
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:01,340
I don't even see you online, James.

496
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:03,420
Do I shut you in?

497
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,219
Did I accept that you're in?

498
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:04,780
No, I'm in the party.

499
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,900
Oh yeah, Jerma's in, Jerma's in.

500
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:07,909
Okay.

501
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,030
All right, so let me get off camera now because I'm disgustingly ugly.

502
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,380
Oh, don't say that.

503
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,820
All right, wait, hold on.

504
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,260
Is there anything I shouldn't be showing?

505
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,380
Is it like passwords or something?

506
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

507
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:20,659
Okay.

508
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,099
Nope, the chances of anyone stumbling across our lobby is

509
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:26,179
uh, it's impossible.

510
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:29,219
These maps have been long hidden from the world.

511
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,179
Long hidden.

512
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:30,500
Hello?

513
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:31,619
Hello.

514
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:32,179
Hey.

515
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:35,219
Oh, the game like cut my mic out for some reason.

516
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:37,539
Oh yeah, the game's going to fuck with your mic 100%.

517
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:38,900
Yeah, if it closes at all,

518
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,219
you're going to need to go back into the properties and fix it.

519
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,699
All right.

520
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:48,139
If the game closes?

521
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,659
If it closes ever.

522
00:56:49,659 --> 00:56:52,860
If the game even opens and minimizes again,

523
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,420
you're going to want to take a quick look.

524
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,820
I feel like the game just like auto-adjusted your mic

525
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,820
and made you like sound.

526
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,380
Because it did.

527
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,059
What?

528
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:00,619
It'll do that.

529
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,019
It'll take control of your mic

530
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:03,900
and it'll make you do things.

531
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,780
It's a parasite.

532
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,369
It's a parasite.

533
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:08,650
You think I'm fucking around.

534
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:09,690
Parasite.

535
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,409
You guys don't understand.

536
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:11,449
Wait, how do I fix this?

537
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,090
You don't, you just try to live with it.

538
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:14,969
You've got to go in your mixer

539
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:16,650
and change it afterwards once you get in.

540
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:16,889
Yeah.

541
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:17,690
Oh my god.

542
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,969
Didn't mean to call you a parasite.

543
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,289
Really just fucking made you all like really quiet.

544
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,000
This is, this is like akin to like video game archaeology.

545
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,239
Like we're just, we're digging through the remains

546
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:30,599
of this old game that no one plays anymore.

547
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,639
And we're finding these little gems from like on area.

548
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:34,360
This is truly bizarre, dude.

549
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,159
Okay, shift is run.

550
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:37,079
Left click is shoot.

551
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,239
Right click is melee.

552
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:40,119
How do you do that?

553
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:42,199
I've, I don't play any of these.

554
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:43,320
I'm going to be so lost.

555
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:46,199
Do we even melee zombies?

556
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,239
I guess you use the knife, right?

557
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:49,289
Is right click melee?

558
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:50,170
I don't think that's true.

559
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:50,969
Right click is aim.

560
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,079
Probably be like what?

561
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:53,880
F or something?

562
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,800
It should be V or F I think for melee.

563
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,769
Oh my god.

564
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:58,489
It's easy.

565
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:01,369
It's like, this was the first zombie game.

566
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:04,570
So, you know, they all could just kind of copy that.

567
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:06,010
Play one, play them all.

568
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:13,179
I like bump you guys up on everything else except for the game.

569
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,340
Yeah, the game messes with your mic.

570
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,900
So it blows us up and then we have to turn each other down.

571
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,860
If I minimize it, will it be fine?

572
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:25,820
Yeah, it should be.

573
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,420
If you can get to your mixer.

574
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:27,739
What?

575
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:28,300
Oh, there you are.

576
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:28,539
Okay.

577
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:29,820
I'm going to invite you now, James.

578
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,940
Is F's what the fuck?

579
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,739
I see no F's.

580
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:34,860
Stop saying F's.

581
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,500
There's no F's.

582
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,300
I don't see any F's.

583
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,949
Y'all crazy.

584
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,349
I think they're saying F for squad.

585
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,429
Oh, did I never?

586
00:58:43,429 --> 00:58:43,829
Hold on.

587
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:49,000
What a fucking confusing thing then.

588
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:53,139
Also, Kraken, what the fuck have you done on that fucking RP server, my man?

589
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:55,539
Oh, I've done some fucked up stuff, dude.

590
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:57,139
Yeah, I fucking heard last night.

591
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,780
They were telling stories about a crime bus.

592
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,500
Yeah.

593
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,769
You know, like, you guys are like enemy.

594
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:10,090
You're like public enemy number one on that server.

595
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,210
We are?

596
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,250
I didn't do anything.

597
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,010
I've never committed a crime on that server.

598
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,050
Yes, you are.

599
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,170
Like, you're fucking.

600
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,610
You're like known by everybody.

601
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,889
I think every conversation that I had, they talk about the PP boys and like some

602
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:22,010
of the shit you guys did.

603
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,489
That's like how I guess I could gather some of the info.

604
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:25,690
Got that scene switch ready.

605
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:26,250
I told you.

606
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:26,730
I'm prepared.

607
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,849
You should accept the squad invite.

608
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:28,409
Just testing it out.

609
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:29,130
Make sure it works.

610
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,929
Launch it.

611
00:59:29,929 --> 00:59:32,170
You know what it is?

612
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:32,730
I don't know.

613
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,449
I don't.

614
00:59:33,449 --> 00:59:34,889
You go to your dashboard and you scroll down.

615
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:37,610
There should be a squad stream section and you just go to invites and hit accept.

616
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:40,469
Oh, shit, dude.

617
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:41,989
This is revolutionary.

618
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:42,309
Yeah.

619
00:59:42,309 --> 00:59:44,309
Yeah, they were pretty cool implementation.

620
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,989
Nice, dude.

621
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:51,000
Also, Jerma, dude, I love your fucking VR stuff that you've been doing as of late.

622
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,000
It's a lot of fun.

623
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,639
Thanks.

624
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:57,400
Some of the shit that you've been your green screen stuff that you're doing the

625
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:57,880
one night.

626
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:00,360
I was like, what the fuck is this?

627
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,800
But it was so good.

628
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

629
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,079
The community came together and made some absolutely fucking hilarious things.

630
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:11,690
So all right.

631
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:12,969
Squad mode, I guess.

632
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:14,170
I've never I've never done.

633
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:16,730
Do I get an achievement for that?

634
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:17,289
Probably, dude.

635
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:21,860
Put that on your jacket for now.

636
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,500
Like a little patch.

637
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:27,900
I tried to put it on the next twitch hoodie.

638
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:29,960
All right.

639
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,599
I send you an invite.

640
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:32,039
You should be able to join our lobby.

641
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:33,880
Should I go change right now?

642
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,239
I'll go put my twitch shirt on.

643
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,159
Oh, I got my twitch hoodie right here, too.

644
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:37,639
Is it on?

645
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,000
Oh, my God.

646
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,800
I threw it on the floor.

647
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,440
I'll pick it up.

648
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,519
Fuck on the floor on the floor.

649
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,260
Oh, you hang it up and you you steam clean that and steam it every day.

650
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:54,389
I ain't going to go get by.

651
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,349
I don't care.

652
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:58,090
I don't know.

653
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,369
I just like make them go get that.

654
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,349
I think we're all just being twitch ambassadors right now.

655
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:04,789
Twitch ambassador.

656
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:05,269
No, dude.

657
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:07,190
I'm a stream labs ambassador.

658
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,909
Oh, OK.

659
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:11,190
Do you have a stream lab or something?

660
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:20,900
I have no idea.

661
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:24,739
How do I all tab out of the game to fucking get to your guys' settings

662
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:25,780
so I can bump you up?

663
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,380
Just go to your like your Windows mixer or go to Discord or click.

664
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,699
I can't even click out of your black ops.

665
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,539
I'm going to like it if you try to leave.

666
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:42,679
Yeah, I haven't had that problem.

667
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,860
And then you make it windowed mode instead of full screen.

668
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:50,840
Where's the where's the actual settings for for black ops?

669
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:54,679
Go to the menu and then graphics from there.

670
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,929
They have windowed borderless window.

671
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,440
So that'll do it.

672
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:06,469
We could start a map in the meantime to take you there.

673
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,349
There's like fucking in here.

674
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,849
Yeah.

675
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,780
Yeah, it'll take me like a couple more seconds to be ready to go

676
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:18,599
because my drive lied to me, but I'll be ready to go after like one map.

677
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,940
Yeah, I mean, we can do whatever.

678
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:27,780
How about this?

679
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,340
You want cracking?

680
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,179
Can you like just teach me how to play black ops?

681
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:32,659
Yeah, do like a warm up.

682
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,179
Well, we'll start the map.

683
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:34,980
I'll walk you around.

684
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,820
I'll give I'll teach the ropes.

685
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,139
Yeah.

686
01:02:37,139 --> 01:02:40,179
And then, you know, bring on the horde.

687
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:41,880
Yeah, of course.

688
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,320
That's what we say when you're a zombie hunt.

689
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,119
You say bring on the horde.

690
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,400
This is Minecraft zombies, Minecraft, but with zombies.

691
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:51,300
What?

692
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,900
Beta 0.15.

693
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:58,119
They got a ways to go to release, but I I have faith.

694
01:02:58,119 --> 01:02:59,400
I think they're gonna get there.

695
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,480
Beta 0.1.5.

696
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,519
Let me go ahead and take a cursory check when that map was made for you guys.

697
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:10,010
Yeah, Minecraft with an EI.

698
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:18,090
This was released in beta form back in June 14th of 2017.

699
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,409
It was like they didn't get the funding for this one.

700
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:22,570
They weren't able to finish it up.

701
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,690
One of these is going to be a screamer.

702
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,650
I just know what I'm telling you.

703
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,329
Isn't this nice?

704
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:29,130
Look, it's like Minecraft, but also a bit of zombies.

705
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,210
It's not a 32 bit texture pack.

706
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,650
Oh, what's that over there?

707
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:35,050
Hey, wait, are you already playing?

708
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,170
I just fixed my stuff.

709
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:36,889
What the fuck?

710
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:38,090
We just started a map.

711
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:38,969
I'm teaching this boy.

712
01:03:38,969 --> 01:03:40,250
He's never seen his own pistol.

713
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,130
God dang it, dude.

714
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:47,139
Man, he's a natural.

715
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:48,019
Look, he's already doing it.

716
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,719
Headshots only.

717
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,519
So actually on the first wave,

718
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:53,480
you're going to want to use the knife.

719
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,360
It gets you more money.

720
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,760
Oh, that's grenade.

721
01:03:57,559 --> 01:03:58,119
It's a V.

722
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:00,199
V is the knife.

723
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:03,480
It's as if somebody shakes your head.

724
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,429
Are you teaching him how to just play like zombies legit?

725
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:10,070
He's never played zombies in my life.

726
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:12,469
This is going to be a great first experience.

727
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,550
I mean, like ever.

728
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,349
Custom maps.

729
01:04:19,269 --> 01:04:20,550
Should we clear debris?

730
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,469
What's the clear debris supposed to be?

731
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:23,750
I think it just opens up more of the map

732
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,869
so we can get more of the items.

733
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,110
But it costs the points to use the points

734
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,389
to buy better guns, basically.

735
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:29,510
Dude, I swear to God,

736
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,670
I've seen the same map in fucking Gmod.

737
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,429
This is like a conversion or something.

738
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,789
Really?

739
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:36,789
You'll see that a lot.

740
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:39,190
Well, this is stupid.

741
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,670
I don't want to play.

742
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,389
I'll see you guys later.

743
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:44,630
I'm starting to see why everyone said no

744
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,389
when I asked them to play tonight.

745
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:46,949
Oh, dude.

746
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,789
We were like the last invitees.

747
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,269
We had weaves, really.

748
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:51,670
Oh, no.

749
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,789
We're at the bottom.

750
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:54,070
We're at the scraps.

751
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,349
You guys were the Hail Mary

752
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,949
and you both said yes and it's like,

753
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,829
yeah, still on.

754
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,750
Oh, James got in.

755
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:03,590
Yeah, I joined in progress.

756
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:04,389
How do I?

757
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:05,110
What's the melee?

758
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:07,349
I got to refine that.

759
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:08,469
That's gross, dude.

760
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:09,909
Yeah, so we got instakill there,

761
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:11,590
which meant whenever you hit a zombie,

762
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:12,389
they die in one hit.

763
01:05:13,719 --> 01:05:14,440
That is true.

764
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,199
Wait, are you teaching me

765
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:17,159
or are you still teaching German?

766
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:18,599
I'm just kind of teaching the room.

767
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,280
You know, you can listen or you don't have to.

768
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,320
Which weapon is X?

769
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,039
Who made that?

770
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,639
It should be Q.

771
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:27,159
Behind you.

772
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:29,829
OK, we're down.

773
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:30,389
It's over.

774
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,429
Fucking pistol.

775
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,070
Are you kidding me?

776
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:41,429
OK, well, I got my controls anyway.

777
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:44,309
Q is your special three.

778
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:46,550
Wait, your mic.

779
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:51,429
I told you, whenever you start the game,

780
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,280
that's like you opened your mouth

781
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,440
and put like the Xbox mic in your mouth,

782
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,280
close your lips around it slowly.

783
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:05,000
That's like the old Xbox 360 mic,

784
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,519
too, the fucking old quality one.

785
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:08,840
All right.

786
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,880
So that was pretty bad.

787
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,360
We're going to look for a better one.

788
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,230
That was probably about two gigs.

789
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,510
Do you buy stuff in zombies?

790
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,989
You do, right?

791
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,309
Yeah, you buy more guns

792
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,909
and upgrades to those guns.

793
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:20,949
Oh, so it's like Counter-Strike.

794
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:21,750
That's what they got it from.

795
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,670
Yeah, I stole from zombies.

796
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,190
No, no, no.

797
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,989
I'm saying counter-strike.

798
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,349
Yeah, whatever you want to tell yourself, dude.

799
01:06:30,389 --> 01:06:31,429
Zombies was the first.

800
01:06:31,429 --> 01:06:32,070
Candyland.

801
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,110
Wanna play Candyland?

802
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,309
I don't know if I want to play Candyland.

803
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:35,670
Oh, like the board game?

804
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:37,030
Yeah, the board game, but it's zombies.

805
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,250
Nice.

806
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,030
There's turkey survival.

807
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,059
That sounds fun.

808
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,679
All right.

809
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:46,119
Turkey survival?

810
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:47,400
So here's the thing.

811
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,480
There's clearly meme maps

812
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,800
and then there's potentially good maps

813
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,159
and there's somewhere in the middle.

814
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,519
Don't blow every meme map at once,

815
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:58,760
trust me, because eventually we'll run out of those.

816
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,039
They're going to get burnt out real quick.

817
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:01,480
We're going to run out of them.

818
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,599
And then we're just going to be playing cod zombies on stream.

819
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:07,530
You need to throw out a titty map at some point.

820
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:10,150
Look, we may have been promising a lot

821
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,190
if we promised titties.

822
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,829
I'm willing to bet there's titties.

823
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,829
I'm willing to lie as much as it takes

824
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:17,670
to get people in for a session

825
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,429
of cod zombies meme stream.

826
01:07:19,429 --> 01:07:20,309
All right, I'll tell you guys.

827
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,429
Sonic zombies.

828
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:25,269
McDonald's custom zombies.

829
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:26,150
McDonald's custom?

830
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,949
Why would you make them McDonald's?

831
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:28,789
The amount of food brand maps that I found.

832
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:31,190
Taco Bell 2.0.

833
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,429
The amount of food brand maps I was able to find.

834
01:07:33,429 --> 01:07:34,469
We got KFC in there.

835
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:35,829
KFC 3.0.

836
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:36,710
Pick all the food ones.

837
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:38,309
Do the food ones back to back to back.

838
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:39,909
Ashley, this one looks good.

839
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:41,030
And then we have to decide.

840
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:42,710
You guys have to talk about your favorite

841
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,099
favorite fast food restaurants after we do it.

842
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:47,670
Yeah, is there a Wendy's one?

843
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,070
There's no, I only see Taco Bell, KFC and McDonald's.

844
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,869
None of them will respond to you on social.

845
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:55,159
Yeah, Wendy's will though.

846
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,360
Yeah, Wendy's sticks to this shit.

847
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,710
Does anyone want to try Super Mario Halloween?

848
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,150
Just fucking pick one, dude.

849
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,869
Oh my God.

850
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,550
Super Mario Halloween.

851
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,869
This one looks good.

852
01:08:06,869 --> 01:08:08,469
This one looks high quality compared to the others.

853
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,309
Mario Dracula teeth then.

854
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:12,219
Yeah.

855
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:13,420
You think there'll be titties in this one?

856
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:16,420
I hope there's titties in one of these.

857
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,340
Looking to get banned today.

858
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,020
Start without me for one more.

859
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,140
What the fuck?

860
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,340
This might be the long haul, Tomato.

861
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,979
I'm willing to sit out the long haul

862
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:26,739
to make sure it's actually fucking.

863
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,060
To put it into perspective,

864
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,020
my disk drive was so afraid of downloading the maps

865
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,380
that it actually lied to me

866
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,779
so I wouldn't have to put Call of Duty on my disk.

867
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,659
So when I went on today, it listed all the maps.

868
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:41,539
But when I went over to my workshop ID thing,

869
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:43,939
like the actual download page, it just said no space.

870
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:49,939
So right now, I'm using all 100 megabytes down at once

871
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:52,420
to blast every mod back onto my game.

872
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,100
That is too many megabytes at the same time.

873
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:54,899
Damn.

874
01:08:54,899 --> 01:08:57,539
I've actually never seen Steam provide this many megabytes.

875
01:08:57,539 --> 01:08:58,899
I think Gabe feels bad for me

876
01:08:58,899 --> 01:08:59,859
because he's letting him in.

877
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,100
What do you have selected here?

878
01:09:02,979 --> 01:09:05,939
We have Mario Halloween.

879
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:06,579
Okay.

880
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:07,460
Let's try to beat this one.

881
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,140
I think we can beat this one.

882
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,619
I've played Mario a couple of times,

883
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:12,899
so I know my way around the.

884
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,380
We've beat zombie levels on this stream.

885
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:15,939
We have.

886
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:17,539
We beat the Star Wars one.

887
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:18,340
How do you beat it?

888
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,539
We also beat Star Wars.

889
01:09:19,539 --> 01:09:21,699
You have to pay like an absurd amount of money

890
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,619
that no one would ever save in COD Zombies.

891
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:24,500
And that lets you leave.

892
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:24,739
Yeah.

893
01:09:24,739 --> 01:09:26,260
There's usually like a little giant.

894
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:26,979
Oh, nice.

895
01:09:26,979 --> 01:09:28,579
Do they give you like a cutscene at the end?

896
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:30,100
Sometimes.

897
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:30,500
Yeah.

898
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,060
Yeah.

899
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:32,899
The Star Wars one we flew away in the Millennium Falcon.

900
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:34,100
Press start to play.

901
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:34,579
You hear that?

902
01:09:34,579 --> 01:09:35,939
Press start to play.

903
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:36,739
Press start to play.

904
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,300
Oh, God.

905
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,500
Is that going to do that?

906
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,380
Why does it keep saying it?

907
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,579
It keeps happening.

908
01:09:40,579 --> 01:09:41,380
Is it the Goomba?

909
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:43,460
I don't know.

910
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,739
Are the Goombas the zombies?

911
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:45,779
Oh, they're behind us.

912
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:46,340
Oh, they're just.

913
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:47,140
They're just zombies, though.

914
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:47,619
They're not.

915
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:48,819
They're just regular zombies.

916
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,939
There are some levels that have custom zombies,

917
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:54,979
like full custom.

918
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:56,819
This is literally just a fucking plug

919
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:58,500
for this person's YouTube channel.

920
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,899
I definitely do remember the Halloween Mario one.

921
01:10:00,899 --> 01:10:01,140
Yeah.

922
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,380
Why is Bowser T-posing over there?

923
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,979
There was a good Mario level I picked,

924
01:10:06,979 --> 01:10:09,060
and then there was this one that I picked as like the.

925
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,619
God damn it.

926
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,140
You picked another one.

927
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,180
I picked the wrong one.

928
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:20,260
Why did we choose to do this again?

929
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:21,460
Is that even Bowser or is that?

930
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:22,340
No, that's like one of the.

931
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,619
That's one of the Bowser's kids.

932
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,020
On the left side, the ginormous Bowser.

933
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:28,819
You're missing the big guy.

934
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,220
Oh, I thought you were talking about like Greco,

935
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,180
whatever his name is.

936
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,340
Greco, the famous Bowser.

937
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,340
It's like Greco, Beco, Deco.

938
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,939
They all have the same name.

939
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:38,500
And then Iggy.

940
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,539
I bought a new pathway.

941
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,770
What the fuck?

942
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,520
Oh shit.

943
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,760
Oh, you opened the path?

944
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,199
Yeah, I opened the path over here.

945
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:52,680
All right, cool.

946
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,159
What do we got?

947
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:54,539
Nothing.

948
01:10:55,399 --> 01:10:55,880
Nothing?

949
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,840
You can hit this block and maybe get something out of it.

950
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,340
What?

951
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,239
Like a power up?

952
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,399
But I stopped to play my game.

953
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:03,960
That was it.

954
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,760
That was the only audio clip from Mario in this whole map.

955
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,020
Maybe we can get to if we get to Bowser,

956
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,819
we can get to the castle over there and we can we can win.

957
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:25,460
Somewhere in that collection is a fully modeled Mario 64 castle level.

958
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,939
And you guys picked Bowser T-pose.

959
01:11:27,939 --> 01:11:29,460
All right, how am I supposed to know?

960
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,739
That's not this at all.

961
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:36,899
Yeah, was there a bullet drop in a bullet drop realistic?

962
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:41,619
The last time I shot a gun in Call of Duty,

963
01:11:41,619 --> 01:11:43,220
I was like 19.

964
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:43,779
Here, hit this.

965
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:44,819
Hit this.

966
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:45,380
Pick this up.

967
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,579
Hit this?

968
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:49,319
Was that the times two?

969
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:50,439
That nukes all of them.

970
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,199
I'm just telling them, you know.

971
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,399
This is an early round, man.

972
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:54,680
You don't even know these strats.

973
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,640
Yeah, why don't you pick it up?

974
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,279
I'm talking Call of Duty 3, by the way, for those of you in the chat.

975
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,399
19, how?

976
01:12:01,399 --> 01:12:01,960
I'll do it.

977
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,960
Oh, that was good.

978
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,560
That was an audio.

979
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,039
T-posing skeletons?

980
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,720
What does this do?

981
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,079
Let's turn on the power first.

982
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:12,279
These are not from Mario.

983
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:17,770
Should I clear one of these?

984
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:19,289
Sure, why not?

985
01:12:19,289 --> 01:12:20,649
I got news for you, friend.

986
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:21,609
I just spent a lot of money.

987
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:27,130
The strangest thing about Call of Duty zombies mod maps is that almost all of them,

988
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:30,329
even if it's not seasonally, you know, accurate at all,

989
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,409
are either Christmas or Halloween related.

990
01:12:32,409 --> 01:12:36,489
I've seen Christmas levels launched in June on fucking zombies.

991
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:38,489
Shit, you're not.

992
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:39,449
Hundreds of them.

993
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:40,810
It's like almost every single one.

994
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:43,050
So this is going to have a lot of Christmas levels and Halloween levels.

995
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:43,850
Is it Garfield?

996
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,409
No, that's the...

997
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:46,170
Oh, dude, do you hear that?

998
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,369
That was Mario's sound.

999
01:12:47,369 --> 01:12:47,869
Yeah.

1000
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:54,939
It's about how you can buy weapons.

1001
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:58,060
I don't like this.

1002
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,220
You're not having fun.

1003
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:00,859
I'm gonna have money.

1004
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:04,699
What is he saying?

1005
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:08,699
The horror.

1006
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:09,199
Oh.

1007
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:15,819
Monopoly.

1008
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:21,000
Because that's when it gets real modded.

1009
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,039
Yeah, I'm honestly feeling...

1010
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:23,960
Play Monopoly in zombies?

1011
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,399
Like full-on Monopoly?

1012
01:13:25,399 --> 01:13:27,880
I'll tell you guys one thing about Monopoly zombies.

1013
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,640
Last time me and Kraken tried that one,

1014
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,920
I don't even think we made it past Go before we did the whole thing.

1015
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,439
We died before going past Go.

1016
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,119
I'm sure these guys are better, though, you know?

1017
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:41,800
We've brought together the greatest gaming teams.

1018
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,520
Yeah, these are the best.

1019
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,199
This is like...

1020
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:47,800
This is like the Mario noises.

1021
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,439
This is just a meme.

1022
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:52,039
Somebody just thought this was fun.

1023
01:13:52,039 --> 01:13:52,279
And you know what?

1024
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:53,319
They spend a lot of time on it.

1025
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:53,720
You can tell.

1026
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:55,159
Yeah, come on.

1027
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:55,960
Come on, some slack.

1028
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,000
That toad is on fire.

1029
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,760
I turned the power on.

1030
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,119
What did that even do?

1031
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:02,039
It powered up these juice boxes.

1032
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,960
Wait, I have the best gun in the game.

1033
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,319
I thought I was gonna do something cool with the map.

1034
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:05,800
Like, what the f...

1035
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,760
Is the best gun in the game?

1036
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,960
I have the Wonder Waffle.

1037
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,319
Oh, that is good.

1038
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:11,079
That is the best gun in the whole game?

1039
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:11,960
The best gun in the whole game?

1040
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,460
I got it?

1041
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,220
Yeah.

1042
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,180
We win, dude.

1043
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,020
Actually, did we save it?

1044
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,020
No, there's no saving it.

1045
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:19,739
Just don't die.

1046
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:20,859
What do you mean don't die?

1047
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:21,659
What do you mean don't die?

1048
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:22,380
What about ammo?

1049
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:26,600
Well, you can't get a max ammo for you.

1050
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,560
Is there infinite ammo?

1051
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,720
What are these fact zombies?

1052
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,760
So I'm not gonna use it then.

1053
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,960
I'm gonna hold on to it until we have the boss.

1054
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,520
They're back here.

1055
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,220
Boss.

1056
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:37,680
That T-posing boss is gonna drop down.

1057
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,239
There you go.

1058
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:39,039
You got ammo back.

1059
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:39,520
Look at that.

1060
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,079
Oh.

1061
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:42,880
There are bosses that are modded into some of these mods, by the way.

1062
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,439
Yeah.

1063
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,159
It's like actual full sequences in this game.

1064
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,159
And Darth Vader knows fucking hype.

1065
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,520
But this one, I don't think has a boss.

1066
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,199
You keep talking about like cool instances.

1067
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:51,600
I know.

1068
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,319
I mean, hey, hey, I'm not here to pick the maps out, all right?

1069
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:56,960
This is an uncurated Kraken version right now.

1070
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,640
I'm still redownloading the mods.

1071
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,399
I feel like I invited you guys to my party

1072
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:01,600
and like only three people showed up

1073
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,439
and then they're all just shitting on the fact

1074
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:04,640
that I don't have any decorations.

1075
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,359
You watered down the booze.

1076
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,239
I wanted them to last longer, dude.

1077
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,279
I know how to show up.

1078
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:12,640
So I want to make sure they had enough.

1079
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,619
Look, my plan was originally to fake you guys out

1080
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:18,939
and start the map downloading on Minecraft

1081
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,859
and then swap it last second to Kiddyland.

1082
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:21,739
Surprise you guys.

1083
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:22,539
Then I was going to, you know,

1084
01:15:22,539 --> 01:15:23,899
then we're going to switch to a nice one after that.

1085
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:25,579
But the whole team has been ruined.

1086
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:29,520
Well, if you didn't tell us, I would have felt for it.

1087
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,359
I'm not the host yet because I'm still here.

1088
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,039
How long does the zombies game actually take

1089
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
did you start to finish?

1090
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,840
Oh, it depends.

1091
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,000
The normal ones don't really have like an end.

1092
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,680
So you just fucking keep going.

1093
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:45,439
We beat the original Minecraft one from last time

1094
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:46,880
we played this in like 15.

1095
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,079
Can I not kill this guy?

1096
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,359
No, it was like 20 to 30.

1097
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:50,880
And the Star Wars one,

1098
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,399
I guess it was about an hour and a half.

1099
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:54,640
Star Wars one was a passion project.

1100
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,680
Yeah, that was it.

1101
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:56,159
That was it.

1102
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:56,720
That was a trip.

1103
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:02,729
We'll, if we just keep progressing,

1104
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:04,250
we can get further to the end.

1105
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,369
And then maybe we can fight Bowser and save Princess Peach.

1106
01:16:07,369 --> 01:16:08,329
All I care about is Bowser.

1107
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:08,810
That's it.

1108
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:10,729
I mean, I can't, I'm going to shoot this into his mouth.

1109
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:13,130
I don't know what this means.

1110
01:16:13,289 --> 01:16:16,890
Oh, you hear that?

1111
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,090
That means there's dogs.

1112
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:18,810
Dogs?

1113
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,609
Oh my God.

1114
01:16:20,329 --> 01:16:21,710
Here they come.

1115
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:24,510
Hold them off.

1116
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,949
Yeah, I can insta-kill these dogs.

1117
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:26,430
Leave it to me.

1118
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,510
Yeah, it's actually bad.

1119
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,510
My sensitivity up by like two points and it's.

1120
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,590
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

1121
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:37,210
All right.

1122
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,239
All right, guys, my chest.

1123
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,520
Tell me we got to wall run this.

1124
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,960
Does anyone know how to wall run?

1125
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,920
How the fuck do you do that?

1126
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,479
Wall run?

1127
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,119
Oh, get this animal.

1128
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:47,600
I'm dead.

1129
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:49,039
No, I'm not.

1130
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:49,520
I'm okay.

1131
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,199
I think if you just hold space, it'll do it when you jump.

1132
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,960
But you have to be sprinting.

1133
01:16:57,609 --> 01:17:01,369
I mean, I just completely guess that.

1134
01:17:01,369 --> 01:17:03,289
I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.

1135
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:04,750
Yeah.

1136
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:06,649
Oh my God.

1137
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:07,130
Does it work?

1138
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,020
Wait, you're still alive.

1139
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,100
Hold space.

1140
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,779
There's no consequences whatsoever.

1141
01:17:14,779 --> 01:17:18,270
So no.

1142
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,909
What the fuck?

1143
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:20,350
I don't understand.

1144
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:21,310
How do you do that?

1145
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:21,869
I think you.

1146
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:24,109
Yeah, it's literally telling me.

1147
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:27,920
Oh my God.

1148
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:31,659
How do you fucking jump to the other side?

1149
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:35,899
All right.

1150
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:38,380
There's a guy with yellow eyes chasing me and then he's

1151
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:39,739
hard because he doesn't die in one hit.

1152
01:17:40,619 --> 01:17:42,220
Wait, do they all have yellow eyes?

1153
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,460
They, they, yeah, they all do.

1154
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,979
Oh, there's one behind you.

1155
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:46,539
Never mind.

1156
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:48,380
All right.

1157
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,020
I'm going to try this again.

1158
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:51,789
Death machine.

1159
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:54,189
What the fuck do you do?

1160
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:55,390
Oh, no.

1161
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:56,670
All right.

1162
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:57,069
I can get you.

1163
01:17:58,029 --> 01:17:59,229
How do I get you?

1164
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:00,109
I found it.

1165
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:01,239
You pick them up.

1166
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:01,800
I'll go.

1167
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,520
I'll take care of them.

1168
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,939
Did I think, did I just use an item on you?

1169
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,020
No, you're good.

1170
01:18:07,819 --> 01:18:09,260
I got max ammo.

1171
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:14,600
All right.

1172
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,640
Let's try this again.

1173
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:27,800
It's almost like when you don't stick on the second part.

1174
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:28,840
Yeah.

1175
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,560
I can do it, dude.

1176
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,359
Watch me.

1177
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:33,720
How did you fucking jump?

1178
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,239
When do you jump off of this?

1179
01:18:35,239 --> 01:18:36,439
Oh, just watch.

1180
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:36,680
Okay.

1181
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,159
Look forward and hold A or D while jumping wall to wall.

1182
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:40,600
Really?

1183
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,079
Yes.

1184
01:18:41,079 --> 01:18:41,640
Keep sprinting.

1185
01:18:43,949 --> 01:18:44,510
That's true.

1186
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:45,229
They got it.

1187
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:45,949
Hey, you got to hold.

1188
01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:49,449
Oh, okay.

1189
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:50,810
Well, zombies are here now.

1190
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,819
Oh, I'm dead.

1191
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:57,600
Somebody save me.

1192
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,399
Somebody save me.

1193
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:00,239
They'll lose the best gun in the whole game.

1194
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,609
I got him.

1195
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:04,699
Does everyone have a little more fun?

1196
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,220
Yeah.

1197
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,140
This is big fun, man.

1198
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:08,859
This is big fun.

1199
01:19:09,979 --> 01:19:11,020
And you want another drink?

1200
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:11,579
What should I do?

1201
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,020
I have $2,700.

1202
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:13,819
Is that my money?

1203
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:14,460
Where's my money?

1204
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:15,180
Bend it on the juice.

1205
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:18,119
Replace the pistol.

1206
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:19,159
People are screaming at me.

1207
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,439
I don't know.

1208
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:23,960
I've never played it before.

1209
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,399
We can get a crawler and then we can just keep fucking trying.

1210
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,960
Yeah, that's the high level strategy.

1211
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,199
Yeah.

1212
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:33,439
Buy the juice.

1213
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,600
Yeah, buy the juice.

1214
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,239
Is this juice?

1215
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,840
You're going to want to get the juggernaut one.

1216
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,359
Yeah, get the juggernaut juice.

1217
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,399
I don't know.

1218
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:43,439
Was that the juggernaut one?

1219
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:44,960
What brand did I just drink?

1220
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,920
It's red.

1221
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,479
Yeah, it's red.

1222
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:48,640
I want an off-brand Stamina right there.

1223
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,079
Was that an off-brand Stamina drink?

1224
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:52,399
Yeah, that was a store brand right there.

1225
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,220
Uh-oh.

1226
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,880
I think I found juggernaut.

1227
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,520
It's back here by Raccoon Mario.

1228
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,039
Replace pistol.

1229
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:02,159
Replace pistol.

1230
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:02,960
I'm sorry.

1231
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,550
Raccoon Mario.

1232
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,670
Oh, yeah.

1233
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:15,340
How much is this?

1234
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:17,159
Here we go.

1235
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,359
It's like 2,500, I think.

1236
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:19,159
Oh, all right.

1237
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:21,239
Oh, that's 950.

1238
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,819
Okay, he just got one of the other best guns in the game right there.

1239
01:20:25,819 --> 01:20:28,859
I just watched him on stream get one of the best guns.

1240
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:29,420
What did he get?

1241
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,779
What the fuck is this shit?

1242
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:31,279
What?

1243
01:20:31,979 --> 01:20:32,479
What?

1244
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:35,760
What did he get?

1245
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,399
I don't know.

1246
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:36,880
Let me...

1247
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,520
He's got like some dual-wheeled laser beam shit.

1248
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,760
GKZ-45 MK3?

1249
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,260
No!

1250
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,289
I mean, it looks cool.

1251
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:46,449
I am a god.

1252
01:20:46,449 --> 01:20:48,369
How do you keep making this fucking jump?

1253
01:20:48,369 --> 01:20:49,329
Oh, crack and fell.

1254
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:50,130
Learn to wall run.

1255
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,859
Oh, I can't see.

1256
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:53,659
I'm trying, dude.

1257
01:20:54,939 --> 01:20:55,979
I actually fucking...

1258
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:56,479
Oh!

1259
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:58,689
No, no, no.

1260
01:20:58,689 --> 01:20:59,649
I don't like this gun.

1261
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:03,090
I found the same exact spot.

1262
01:21:03,729 --> 01:21:04,609
Whoa, what was that?

1263
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:05,090
I don't know.

1264
01:21:05,090 --> 01:21:06,770
It's my new weapon that I locked up.

1265
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:07,970
What? You got a black hole gun?

1266
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,569
I got a black hole gun.

1267
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:11,569
Of course, the guy that doesn't know what to do gets it.

1268
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:13,729
Did you just fall?

1269
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:14,210
Just now?

1270
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:14,850
Yeah.

1271
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:15,810
Yeah, I walked right off.

1272
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,810
But I got stamina up so I can run forever.

1273
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:21,979
No, I was there.

1274
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:22,939
Oh, really?

1275
01:21:22,939 --> 01:21:23,739
I should do that, too.

1276
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:24,460
That was pretty close.

1277
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,210
That's actually a good idea.

1278
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:27,489
Are we losing money for doing this?

1279
01:21:27,489 --> 01:21:28,289
Oh, baby.

1280
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:29,810
Oh, baby.

1281
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,180
Oh, come on.

1282
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:33,859
Oh, my god.

1283
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:34,500
I'm so bad.

1284
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,890
There's only two zombies.

1285
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:40,529
No!

1286
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:41,409
What happened?

1287
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:42,369
Never mind the pain.

1288
01:21:43,329 --> 01:21:44,210
Don't kill the zombies,

1289
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:45,250
because then the round goes...

1290
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,369
What am I doing wrong?

1291
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,289
Don't kill the zombies.

1292
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:53,250
I actually got hurt just now.

1293
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:53,569
I don't know.

1294
01:21:53,569 --> 01:21:54,689
Don't hurt that one.

1295
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:54,850
What?

1296
01:21:54,850 --> 01:21:55,489
Don't hurt that...

1297
01:21:55,489 --> 01:21:56,210
No!

1298
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:56,529
Why?

1299
01:21:56,529 --> 01:21:57,090
What's wrong?

1300
01:21:58,609 --> 01:21:59,569
It's a new round.

1301
01:21:59,569 --> 01:22:01,729
What do you mean it's a new round?

1302
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:02,369
It's all right,

1303
01:22:02,369 --> 01:22:04,770
because you got a new guy on the team, hey.

1304
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:05,489
Oh, he's here.

1305
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:07,010
It's me.

1306
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:07,409
I'm here.

1307
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:09,649
Do you know how to wall jump, Tomato?

1308
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,689
Oh, now there's 56 of them.

1309
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:14,050
I don't even know how to get to you

1310
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,010
if we're going to be real.

1311
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:16,770
Where am I?

1312
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,050
Did you not spawn right on us?

1313
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:19,890
No, I spawned like...

1314
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:23,729
I'm pretty close to T-posing cloud turtle,

1315
01:22:23,729 --> 01:22:24,449
more than anything.

1316
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:26,529
Oh, look.

1317
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:26,689
Yeah.

1318
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:27,489
Oh, yeah.

1319
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:28,609
I may be making a mistake.

1320
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:29,010
Oh, yeah.

1321
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,409
Oh, yeah.

1322
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:30,289
Fuck.

1323
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:32,079
Sorry, guys.

1324
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:34,479
My first ever experience in Cod Zombies

1325
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:37,279
is Mario meme Bowser T-pose map.

1326
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:39,680
I don't have time to understand.

1327
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,279
And fucking wall run parkour.

1328
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:43,899
Oh, I keep getting to the end.

1329
01:22:43,899 --> 01:22:44,300
I made it.

1330
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,340
What the fuck?

1331
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,149
I made it to the end.

1332
01:22:47,149 --> 01:22:48,189
Oh, what does that do?

1333
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,109
Nothing.

1334
01:22:50,109 --> 01:22:50,909
There's Wario.

1335
01:22:51,789 --> 01:22:52,189
What?

1336
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:54,430
That's it.

1337
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:54,909
Get ready.

1338
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,590
I'm about to pull this off in one go.

1339
01:22:57,630 --> 01:22:59,300
You guys should hurry up and get over here.

1340
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,180
I don't have any guns.

1341
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,500
Can you guys Luigi me over there?

1342
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:03,859
What?

1343
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:04,659
Luigi me?

1344
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:05,220
Yeah, just like...

1345
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,380
Luigi just does it for you

1346
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:08,500
in Mario 3D world.

1347
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,039
Oh, oh.

1348
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,319
I don't...

1349
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:15,359
I don't know what you're talking about.

1350
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:16,319
That last one I can't get.

1351
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:16,720
Oh, my God.

1352
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,600
We're going to die.

1353
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,000
I'm dead.

1354
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:19,840
No.

1355
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:20,960
You're my mirror town.

1356
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:22,500
What?

1357
01:23:22,579 --> 01:23:23,220
Keep them off me.

1358
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,739
I'm going to get you out of there.

1359
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:25,460
Oh, God.

1360
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:28,350
I'm going to get you out of there.

1361
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:28,909
Can I do it?

1362
01:23:30,189 --> 01:23:30,989
Keep him off of me.

1363
01:23:30,989 --> 01:23:32,270
Keep the one off of me.

1364
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:33,229
Yeah, we're doing it.

1365
01:23:35,979 --> 01:23:38,939
Oh, I don't know what's happening.

1366
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:39,579
I revived.

1367
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:40,779
Please don't make me go back

1368
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:41,979
to that fucking other area.

1369
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:43,340
I got you.

1370
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:43,819
Go back.

1371
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,380
Yeah, we're fine.

1372
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:47,579
Why don't you pick me up?

1373
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:49,260
I was trying to get to you.

1374
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,180
Two men zombies pushed me out of the way.

1375
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:51,739
I got you.

1376
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:52,140
Don't worry.

1377
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,260
German's distracted.

1378
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,060
He just ran off.

1379
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:55,340
No, I'm all right.

1380
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,060
I'm all right.

1381
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:57,180
There's nine zombies left.

1382
01:23:58,689 --> 01:23:59,170
What?

1383
01:23:59,170 --> 01:23:59,810
Pick me up.

1384
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:01,409
But I don't want to get killed.

1385
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:02,689
No, not me.

1386
01:24:02,689 --> 01:24:03,489
I died.

1387
01:24:03,489 --> 01:24:03,970
He's dead.

1388
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:04,369
What?

1389
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:04,609
No.

1390
01:24:04,609 --> 01:24:04,930
Wait.

1391
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:05,409
You can die?

1392
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:06,770
Oh, no.

1393
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,890
I didn't know you could die.

1394
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:09,409
There's only eight zombies left.

1395
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:11,890
They're getting awfully close.

1396
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,010
I didn't know you could actually perma die.

1397
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:17,010
I thought if we all died.

1398
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,250
Well, eventually he'll come back.

1399
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:20,930
We'll come back in another black hole.

1400
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,210
But he won't have his guns anymore.

1401
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:26,210
I like slow games like pick Ross.

1402
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,560
Sudoku.

1403
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,199
All right.

1404
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,560
I have I'm ready.

1405
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,800
I'm ready to like switch over and take over the

1406
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,720
the curating duty for this like stream.

1407
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:35,279
Wait.

1408
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,159
James is almost at Peach.

1409
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,760
Yeah, I'm at Peach, dude.

1410
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,039
I see T posing Peach.

1411
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:40,159
How much do you need for that?

1412
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,359
I need more money.

1413
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:41,859
How much?

1414
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:44,079
It's 3000.

1415
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,680
I have 1700.

1416
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,159
You can do it.

1417
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,479
I can get the Peach.

1418
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:50,960
I always say if we get to Peach, then we win.

1419
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,359
How about that?

1420
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:52,239
What else is called that?

1421
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:52,739
I made it.

1422
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:56,449
Oh, yeah, it was over here, too.

1423
01:24:57,329 --> 01:24:59,039
We just need the money.

1424
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:00,079
We don't have enough money to do this.

1425
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:01,760
How much money is it?

1426
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:02,479
It's 3000.

1427
01:25:06,449 --> 01:25:09,170
I can make us the money, but I need someone said to shoot

1428
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,369
the teddy bears that are hidden.

1429
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:13,409
Oh, I saw one of those hidden teddy bears.

1430
01:25:13,409 --> 01:25:13,970
Really?

1431
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:14,930
I just shot one.

1432
01:25:14,930 --> 01:25:16,050
I just shot one.

1433
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,409
What the fuck does that do?

1434
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,289
Yeah, just got one.

1435
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,369
We can't pull our money together.

1436
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,760
No, this isn't a cooperative game.

1437
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:31,909
Oh, man, that last jump is.

1438
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:32,229
I know.

1439
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:33,270
I keep falling there.

1440
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,670
I don't know.

1441
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,470
That last jump.

1442
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,869
The angle.

1443
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,569
This is a boss wave incoming.

1444
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:38,770
How can you jump?

1445
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:41,729
This map was just shitty and intriguing enough for you guys

1446
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:45,170
to kill just enough time for my entire download to pretty much finish,

1447
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,289
which was very nice of you.

1448
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:50,020
Oh, this is so fun.

1449
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,460
So whenever we're sick of this one, we can move on to something.

1450
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,260
It's more so whether or not we're going to be sick of you guys trying this jump.

1451
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:57,699
Hurry the fuck up and make it.

1452
01:25:57,699 --> 01:25:58,180
Oh, my God.

1453
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:59,779
Why are you waiting for me?

1454
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:00,340
I'm dead.

1455
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:01,380
What?

1456
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:01,779
You're dead?

1457
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:03,140
Yeah, German left me.

1458
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:05,699
But he made it.

1459
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:06,420
Okay, I'm here.

1460
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,300
Are you happy?

1461
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,100
Jesus.

1462
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,500
We got to kill the last four zombies.

1463
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,699
They were way back there.

1464
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:13,460
No.

1465
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:16,659
No, there's got to be a way for them to follow us.

1466
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:16,979
Nope.

1467
01:26:16,979 --> 01:26:17,699
You got to go back.

1468
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:20,819
I think they come through this blue door.

1469
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:22,680
Don't worry, guys.

1470
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,279
I think that mapmaker had the foresight to build that mechanic into this.

1471
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:27,960
Maybe, because you can't do anything with this shit.

1472
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,880
If he had the time to make it when I buy a gun, it makes a coin ding sound,

1473
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,329
then I'm going to guess there's at least a little bit of thought.

1474
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:36,689
Okay, I need to kill four zombies.

1475
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,720
Wait, is that Yoshi looking at Yoshi's own skeleton?

1476
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:41,960
Yeah.

1477
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:42,680
I'll be ready.

1478
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,319
That's...

1479
01:26:43,319 --> 01:26:43,720
I'm here.

1480
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:45,720
Okay, they're coming.

1481
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:48,680
All right, now I just need to get to you easy.

1482
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:49,720
Where are you?

1483
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,800
At the spot that spawn.

1484
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,920
Okay, well, here comes another wave.

1485
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:55,119
All right.

1486
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:56,159
I'm here with you, though.

1487
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:57,439
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:26:57,439 --> 01:26:59,279
One of us is going to get enough money to get to Peach.

1489
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,399
Dogs left.

1490
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:01,199
Are you going to be okay?

1491
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,039
It's dogs.

1492
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:04,079
Oh, wait, you went all the way back?

1493
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:04,720
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,479
I came back to kill the zombie.

1495
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:06,880
Okay.

1496
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,800
You get out of here.

1497
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,279
It's all right.

1498
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:11,840
I'll get there.

1499
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,319
James, do you have like good like sodas, like juggernaut?

1500
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:19,199
Do you have anything fancy?

1501
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:19,840
Oh, no.

1502
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,600
I've got juggernaut and the stamina one.

1503
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,880
Okay, then you just stand in front of me and catch all the dog mouths.

1504
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,279
All right.

1505
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,640
Bad dog.

1506
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:29,359
I just bought a nice gun.

1507
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:30,239
I don't have anything else.

1508
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:32,960
All right.

1509
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,520
Where are you?

1510
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:33,920
Here we go.

1511
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,039
Let me know if they spawn back here.

1512
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,399
Yeah, I got you.

1513
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,859
Now, this is that Black Ops co-op gameplay.

1514
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,100
I was really seeking out when I conned you all.

1515
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,819
They just the dog just went through that blue portal door thing.

1516
01:27:48,819 --> 01:27:49,859
Whatever the fuck that is.

1517
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:50,260
I did it.

1518
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:51,140
I'm here.

1519
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,500
He did program that shit.

1520
01:27:53,619 --> 01:27:54,739
You sold him short.

1521
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:56,180
Oh, yeah.

1522
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:56,899
No, it's coming in.

1523
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:57,939
You good?

1524
01:27:58,899 --> 01:28:01,029
It's good.

1525
01:28:01,029 --> 01:28:02,149
He's just going to do the jump.

1526
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:06,069
Oh, intense, intense.

1527
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:06,550
Nice, guys.

1528
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:06,789
Nice.

1529
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:07,189
Nice.

1530
01:28:07,189 --> 01:28:08,710
Reload your guns, boys.

1531
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,829
I'm like shaking right now.

1532
01:28:09,829 --> 01:28:10,869
Black Ops things.

1533
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:11,270
Damn it.

1534
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:15,829
You still don't have enough money to get through to the fucking peach.

1535
01:28:17,649 --> 01:28:18,289
Someone's close.

1536
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:19,569
Someone's got to 2,400.

1537
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:20,449
That's me.

1538
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:20,770
Who is?

1539
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:21,250
Yeah, who is?

1540
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:21,810
You have 2,400?

1541
01:28:22,529 --> 01:28:22,930
Yeah.

1542
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:23,250
Wow.

1543
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:24,050
I love this.

1544
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,250
I love the framing of this.

1545
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,850
You see peach desperate for help.

1546
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:30,130
And right above it is a YouTube ad for someone's channel.

1547
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,689
Right above that is Mario.

1548
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:34,130
And above that is a castle.

1549
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:38,369
And above that is Bowser juggling boobs, I think.

1550
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,250
Oh, I thought you said juggling boobs.

1551
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,810
I was like, you guys have been talking about boobs for like 45 minutes.

1552
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:44,770
The boob viewer prompts.

1553
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:46,470
No.

1554
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,550
Oh, fuck off.

1555
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:49,270
Cock.

1556
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,770
Cock.

1557
01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:52,390
Look at this meta here.

1558
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,829
They're trying to tell a story here with this mirror.

1559
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:58,020
I got enough.

1560
01:28:58,579 --> 01:28:59,939
James is almost there.

1561
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:00,180
What?

1562
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:05,220
I'll wait until the pack is a little bit more lower down, I guess.

1563
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:05,779
Oh, my God.

1564
01:29:05,779 --> 01:29:06,260
What the fuck?

1565
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,739
Is that the waffle gun?

1566
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:10,420
Yeah, I kind of can't lose.

1567
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:11,619
Wait, crack.

1568
01:29:11,619 --> 01:29:12,500
I'm going to break down.

1569
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,539
You're incredibly powerful.

1570
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:14,020
Yeah, I'm dead.

1571
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:14,500
It's all right.

1572
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,140
You guys have fun.

1573
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,579
I'm going to watch the peach part.

1574
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:20,260
You're going to watch the peach part?

1575
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:21,460
Yeah, I'm a viewer now.

1576
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:21,859
It's cool.

1577
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,100
I can come back and get you.

1578
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,300
I don't have anything to lose.

1579
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,819
I mean, now I'm out of time, I think.

1580
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:28,500
No, I can try.

1581
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,000
No, that's not right.

1582
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,760
We've made the necessary amount of money.

1583
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,000
Okay, I'm watching.

1584
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,720
Oh, my God.

1585
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:38,439
Go get peach.

1586
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,199
I have a black hole gun, too.

1587
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:46,149
I don't understand how you got every gun in the game.

1588
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:49,270
I kind of just, yeah, I typed in the console.

1589
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:00,420
I am looking forward to what this payoff is going to be.

1590
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,340
If there even will be any payoff.

1591
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:02,979
Payoff?

1592
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:04,180
Is there any payoff?

1593
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:05,060
Will there be payoff?

1594
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,100
No.

1595
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,500
No?

1596
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:11,220
In a mod map of Halloween, Mario, you're shooting a payoff.

1597
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:13,380
No.

1598
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:15,699
Okay, I'm fine.

1599
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,220
What the fuck?

1600
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:17,460
What?

1601
01:30:19,829 --> 01:30:20,470
Go get peach.

1602
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:22,600
It's time.

1603
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:24,449
4,000.

1604
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:26,210
Wait.

1605
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:27,600
Wait, what?

1606
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,960
It should be 3,000.

1607
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,760
No, it's 3,000.

1608
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,720
The other one is 4,000.

1609
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,359
It's 3,000.

1610
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:32,560
You want me to do it?

1611
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,359
Yeah, I guess.

1612
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:34,640
I'll get the next one.

1613
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,359
Peach.

1614
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:36,960
Oh, the pack of punches here.

1615
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:37,600
What does that do?

1616
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:38,960
5,000.

1617
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,000
Wait, upgrade your weapon.

1618
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:41,680
Oh, shoot.

1619
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,279
I can upgrade my starter pistol.

1620
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:45,359
This is one of the coolest things you can do in the whole game.

1621
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:47,760
Wait, rescue peach is only 3,000?

1622
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,239
No, it's-

1623
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,439
No, it's 43,000.

1624
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:51,199
43,000.

1625
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:52,880
43,000.

1626
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,359
No.

1627
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:54,960
The fucking rescue peach.

1628
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,680
That means we have to play for like six hours.

1629
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:58,640
I could keep on saving up some more money.

1630
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,680
I don't want to do that.

1631
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,039
That's like six hours of gameplay.

1632
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:06,720
I just killed everybody in one shot.

1633
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,079
I'm going to pack a punch to the starter pistol,

1634
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:11,600
which is a wacky part of the game.

1635
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,319
You get the starting pistol.

1636
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:15,920
Hey, that scared the shit out of me.

1637
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:18,000
I don't know why.

1638
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:20,159
I shoot grenades.

1639
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,109
Hey, you guys want to give up?

1640
01:31:25,109 --> 01:31:27,430
Hey, you know those other like 75 maps?

1641
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:31,430
Yeah, I got like 70 other smooth maps we can shoot if you guys want.

1642
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,750
Yeah.

1643
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:33,670
You don't want to rescue peach.

1644
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:34,149
What?

1645
01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:34,649
No.

1646
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:37,989
We did not rescue peach.

1647
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:42,149
You know, it's like a to-be-continued scenario.

1648
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:45,300
But we're so close.

1649
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:45,939
You're losing out, man.

1650
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:48,819
I guess you could always see the ending on that dude's YouTube channel.

1651
01:31:48,819 --> 01:31:49,619
Oh, you're right.

1652
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,220
Dude.

1653
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:52,579
Shout out, you always win.

1654
01:31:52,579 --> 01:31:53,539
You always win.

1655
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,930
That's not a bad YouTube channel name.

1656
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:58,289
That's a pretty good name.

1657
01:31:58,289 --> 01:32:00,850
That was definitely an early like 2000 name.

1658
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:05,000
I can't remember if I downloaded a bunch of his maps

1659
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,399
because I thought they all looked like trash garbage or not.

1660
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,560
There were definitely a couple people that I went through their entire catalog grabbing

1661
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,760
maps because I was like, oh, fuck.

1662
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,520
He's like, all right.

1663
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,920
So do I make you the you win, you lose.

1664
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:17,640
You always win.

1665
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,359
I don't know if you can make me the leader.

1666
01:32:20,359 --> 01:32:21,800
Yeah, I don't know either.

1667
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,319
Do you want to tell me which map to pick?

1668
01:32:23,319 --> 01:32:24,279
Or do you have a?

1669
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:27,880
Yeah, I'll back out and tell you which one to pick next.

1670
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,319
Okay, why are you back out?

1671
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:32,039
Because I that way I can know which maps are still downloading for me

1672
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:33,239
and which ones are done.

1673
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:33,560
Okay.

1674
01:32:34,119 --> 01:32:36,119
Because there's still a couple of them pushing through.

1675
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:41,430
Let's do you guys want to do a real map?

1676
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:42,869
Do you want to do another shit take?

1677
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:44,869
Because that's what it boils down to.

1678
01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:45,670
We could just kind of roll.

1679
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:47,909
What do you consider to be a real map?

1680
01:32:49,029 --> 01:32:53,829
There are real decent maps like that Binding of Isaac one is actually a decent map.

1681
01:32:53,829 --> 01:32:54,149
Really?

1682
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:56,710
Like stuff like A Christmas Carol, which is a decent map.

1683
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:02,310
Then there's ones like Pokemon Sun Slash Moon, which I can assure you is a shit map.

1684
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:04,149
And Taco Bell, which is shit.

1685
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:05,350
I think one sounds pretty cool.

1686
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,630
There's zombies and cars.

1687
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:08,390
Mario Kart Edition where you drive cars.

1688
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:12,979
Oh, so this is going to be a throw up stream.

1689
01:33:13,619 --> 01:33:14,020
Yeah.

1690
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:15,539
Yeah, I don't drive car.

1691
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:17,060
I doubt to do after birth.

1692
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,659
That one sounds okay.

1693
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:19,539
That one can't fail.

1694
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:24,659
It's Isaac and it's actually got like challenges and like the proper rooms

1695
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,260
and you get rewards in the right rooms.

1696
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,539
It's all okay.

1697
01:33:27,539 --> 01:33:29,220
It's all like that one's a legit.

1698
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:30,180
Okay, cool.

1699
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,140
Yeah, let's do it.

1700
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:34,739
Sorry, bless me.

1701
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:37,140
That's not like somebody grabbed you in the back of the head and need you and think

1702
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:40,100
Yeah, that was like, but bang.

1703
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:44,689
Thank you.

1704
01:33:44,689 --> 01:33:45,090
Crack it.

1705
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:55,489
We lose somebody.

1706
01:33:55,489 --> 01:33:55,890
Sorry.

1707
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:56,689
Oh, there we go.

1708
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:57,489
Oh, you disappeared.

1709
01:33:57,489 --> 01:33:57,649
Yeah.

1710
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:00,289
Oh, I can read.

1711
01:34:00,289 --> 01:34:02,850
I can join mid game if you guys just start loading.

1712
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:05,409
I'll join while it's loading too much data.

1713
01:34:05,409 --> 01:34:05,810
There we go.

1714
01:34:05,810 --> 01:34:06,289
There it goes.

1715
01:34:08,789 --> 01:34:10,470
After this, we'll do Candyland.

1716
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,750
Candyland.

1717
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:15,350
Candyland.

1718
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:17,430
I'd like to do Monopoly again.

1719
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:20,420
Yeah, I'm curious about Monopoly too.

1720
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:21,699
Do you actually play Monopoly?

1721
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:25,640
Do we have to actually place Monopoly?

1722
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,000
Or are you asking in the game?

1723
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,560
I think you make money by killing the zombies and then you pay to move the dice.

1724
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:33,960
Oh, yeah.

1725
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,479
It costs zombie points to move your dice.

1726
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:41,000
It's a mess.

1727
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,800
It's like it's rough at the very beginning too because they're going to move.

1728
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,239
What the fuck?

1729
01:34:47,239 --> 01:34:47,720
What?

1730
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:48,760
Whoa.

1731
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:52,119
They even have the Isaac font and everything.

1732
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:53,800
Dude, I told you.

1733
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,640
I picked out some actual mods.

1734
01:34:57,779 --> 01:34:59,060
Oh, man, if you go into your graphics,

1735
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,020
it changes all the font and like the menus too and everything.

1736
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:02,659
Oh, that's cool.

1737
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:04,819
Nice.

1738
01:35:06,819 --> 01:35:07,699
Oh, knife only.

1739
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:08,180
I'm sorry.

1740
01:35:12,609 --> 01:35:13,729
Host kick noob.

1741
01:35:13,729 --> 01:35:14,930
Not knifeing first round.

1742
01:35:17,010 --> 01:35:19,329
I'm trying to help you guys out to get further here.

1743
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:21,010
And I say, fuck you guys.

1744
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:21,810
You guys are idiots.

1745
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:22,449
And you booed me.

1746
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:31,430
Okay, so my eye-catcher actually looks like me.

1747
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,989
What the fuck?

1748
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:33,029
It does.

1749
01:35:33,829 --> 01:35:34,789
What the fuck?

1750
01:35:34,789 --> 01:35:35,670
Does that mine look like me?

1751
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:36,229
Knife only.

1752
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,000
Okay.

1753
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,710
Do we need the music?

1754
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,550
We like the music, right?

1755
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:46,310
I think I want to turn it off.

1756
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:47,350
It's all right.

1757
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:48,390
It's quite ominous.

1758
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:48,869
I like it.

1759
01:35:49,829 --> 01:35:50,630
Quick revive.

1760
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,380
I'm going to open this door.

1761
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,979
So do you pick a door to go through?

1762
01:35:54,979 --> 01:35:56,420
Or is 2000 going to open this door?

1763
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,020
Come forward.

1764
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:58,579
Who's got 2000?

1765
01:35:58,579 --> 01:35:59,699
That's crikey.

1766
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:00,739
I will open.

1767
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:03,890
Whoa, there's a chest.

1768
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:04,770
Cool.

1769
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:06,369
It's randomizing.

1770
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,279
What did we get?

1771
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:09,760
Nothing.

1772
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:11,119
Nothing here.

1773
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,079
There's nothing in that chest.

1774
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,399
It's alive.

1775
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,159
We need a key, I think.

1776
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,520
I think we actually need to get a key.

1777
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,279
Hey, and now we wipe and die.

1778
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:22,640
It's happening.

1779
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:23,039
No.

1780
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:25,199
Is it still knife only?

1781
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,039
I got a knife.

1782
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,920
Now it's only knife only if we have insta-kill.

1783
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,039
We all take turns opening doors.

1784
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,720
We do have insta-kill.

1785
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,720
So if we have insta-kill, it's knife only.

1786
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,960
Don't have insta-kill, shoot him.

1787
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,520
All right.

1788
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,720
Who's opening this one?

1789
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,520
Who's the rich one?

1790
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:45,039
It opened up.

1791
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:45,760
How did it open?

1792
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:47,520
Oh, how did it open?

1793
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:52,239
Oh, we got weapon box.

1794
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:52,640
That's good.

1795
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:54,880
How much did this cost money?

1796
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,800
Give me the treasure.

1797
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,479
Whoa, what the fuck was...

1798
01:36:58,479 --> 01:36:59,439
Did you guys see that thing?

1799
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,520
There was some sort of goblin monster in the box.

1800
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,359
Oh, no.

1801
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:08,960
Hey.

1802
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:09,439
Are we bad?

1803
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:09,840
Are we bad?

1804
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,760
I think we're bad, gang.

1805
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:16,659
That grenade just saved our lives.

1806
01:37:16,659 --> 01:37:17,300
I can do this.

1807
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:18,579
Oh, God.

1808
01:37:18,579 --> 01:37:19,539
I can't.

1809
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:20,020
Get us.

1810
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:21,460
I'm trying.

1811
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:22,420
Do whatever it takes.

1812
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,300
I have no more ammo.

1813
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:26,020
I have no more...

1814
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:27,460
Yeah, I can crawl with knife.

1815
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,600
I'm dying, dude.

1816
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,960
I get in this position when I play VR.

1817
01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:37,989
All right.

1818
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,510
Nice job, guys.

1819
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,119
Somebody said fucking noobs.

1820
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,079
Keep that thing alive.

1821
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:44,640
Keep that thing alive.

1822
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:46,079
Keep it in crawl.

1823
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:47,680
950.

1824
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:48,399
I won't make the new...

1825
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,640
Yeah, just keep heading around.

1826
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:50,880
We're good.

1827
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,199
We're good.

1828
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:51,520
We're good.

1829
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,159
Just fucking stop explaining what you're gonna explain.

1830
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,279
Yeah, I'm just panicking.

1831
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:58,319
Dude, he's getting closer.

1832
01:37:58,319 --> 01:37:58,560
All right.

1833
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,199
Buy us all some.

1834
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,239
Open another door over here.

1835
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:01,520
Hey, there's rocks over here.

1836
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,520
If you...

1837
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:03,760
Oh, God.

1838
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,000
Apparently, the blue one, there should be an item in here.

1839
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,039
Oh, it's 500.

1840
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:07,840
Fucking do that.

1841
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,560
Never mind.

1842
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,119
How much is it?

1843
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,880
I can't buy another gun.

1844
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,199
Dude, I'm gonna get killed by this thing.

1845
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:13,520
I can't...

1846
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:13,920
Hey, hey.

1847
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:14,319
Shoot him.

1848
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:15,039
Should I shoot him?

1849
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:15,279
Help.

1850
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:15,920
Help.

1851
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:16,560
I don't know.

1852
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,680
Wait, did I kill you?

1853
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:19,920
Get him off, man.

1854
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,039
I don't know if I killed you or not.

1855
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,319
Just...

1856
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:23,359
No, just get me up.

1857
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:24,239
Don't let that thing come.

1858
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,000
Don't let that thing get you.

1859
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Please, fuck off.

1860
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,199
All right, I'll be over here.

1861
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,319
I'll be like the dog food.

1862
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,079
I'll leave him for two seconds.

1863
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,079
I think I accidentally tinged him.

1864
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:38,000
There's a player over here on the wall that says you can draw it.

1865
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,279
And I don't know what the fuck that even...

1866
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:42,159
I'm gonna kill this thing so I get enough money to open this door for us.

1867
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:42,560
And then we're gonna...

1868
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,520
I still have a pistol.

1869
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:43,840
Don't do...

1870
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,239
Yeah.

1871
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:44,800
There's more.

1872
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,079
There's more pathways over here.

1873
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:46,800
Here, I opened it.

1874
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,239
2,000.

1875
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,119
Oh, the power isn't here.

1876
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:49,600
Power isn't here.

1877
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,239
This is 2,000.

1878
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,939
Oh, that's 2,000.

1879
01:38:52,819 --> 01:38:56,260
I mean, I feel like we need to open up some of the stuff connecting these rooms together.

1880
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:56,739
I have to kill this thing.

1881
01:38:56,739 --> 01:38:58,260
It's freaking me out.

1882
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:58,899
I think that works.

1883
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,899
Like, I don't know how the fuck this works.

1884
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:03,939
How do you draw this?

1885
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:05,380
Hang on, let me see.

1886
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:06,340
I'm gonna get stuck here.

1887
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,899
I'm holding F.

1888
01:39:09,619 --> 01:39:11,539
I'm aiming and drawing.

1889
01:39:11,539 --> 01:39:12,260
I need money.

1890
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:14,500
Nothing's happening.

1891
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:16,100
Okay.

1892
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:16,420
Yeah.

1893
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:16,659
Nice.

1894
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:18,579
Wow, this is like...

1895
01:39:18,579 --> 01:39:19,460
Oh, this is a good room.

1896
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,260
Guys, come over here.

1897
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:22,149
Good room?

1898
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,949
This is like good shit.

1899
01:39:23,989 --> 01:39:25,430
You could like actually do around.

1900
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:28,390
It's a slot machine.

1901
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:29,670
Yeah, I just...

1902
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:30,149
See?

1903
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,550
What?

1904
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:31,829
Oh, shit.

1905
01:39:31,829 --> 01:39:32,789
What is this?

1906
01:39:32,789 --> 01:39:33,989
They'll fucking lock, dude.

1907
01:39:33,989 --> 01:39:34,949
What is that?

1908
01:39:34,949 --> 01:39:35,510
I don't know.

1909
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,989
An item?

1910
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:38,550
Out of order.

1911
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:40,630
You broke it.

1912
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:41,430
It wasn't a weapon.

1913
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,630
What did you get?

1914
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:43,189
It was a...

1915
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,750
I don't know.

1916
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:45,270
Watch out behind you, guys.

1917
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,869
The guy's in here.

1918
01:39:46,869 --> 01:39:47,590
Ow.

1919
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:50,319
I think it was a shield part or something that you build.

1920
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:50,560
Oh.

1921
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:53,920
Yeah, there are parts in Black Ops 3, zombies,

1922
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:58,000
like you pick up parts of stuff that you then construct at counters to make,

1923
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:01,439
you know, into gear, I guess.

1924
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:03,760
Did you see this gun on the wall?

1925
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,880
Did you figure this thing out?

1926
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,359
We have to find Chalk to draw that.

1927
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:08,000
Keep it off him.

1928
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,560
I need a weapon.

1929
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:12,239
Present hold to draw Uzi.

1930
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:13,520
Yeah.

1931
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,399
I think we need Chalk.

1932
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:16,319
I bet you need Chalk and you actually draw it on the wall.

1933
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:17,279
You don't trace it.

1934
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:18,640
You just need Chalk on the ground.

1935
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,680
Oh, right here's the Chalk.

1936
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:21,119
Oh, nice.

1937
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,439
It's a gun version of Chalk.

1938
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:27,840
I think we want to defend in this big room.

1939
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,079
Yeah.

1940
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,800
Why didn't it do it?

1941
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,439
Did you drop a coin?

1942
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:32,239
I just picked up Chalk.

1943
01:40:33,680 --> 01:40:34,399
Is there a tinted...

1944
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:35,680
People saying tinted rocks, maybe?

1945
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,390
It was a blue rock and you still had to buy it.

1946
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,630
Yeah.

1947
01:40:45,909 --> 01:40:46,390
The fuck?

1948
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:48,390
Double points.

1949
01:40:49,989 --> 01:40:50,710
Oh, this is fun.

1950
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:53,829
I picked up the Chalk, but it doesn't let me take out the gun.

1951
01:40:53,829 --> 01:40:55,510
I have it in my inventory.

1952
01:40:57,670 --> 01:40:58,470
What the fuck?

1953
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:03,270
It shows that I have Chalk.

1954
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:05,510
Let me draw this Uzi.

1955
01:41:06,069 --> 01:41:06,390
All right.

1956
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:07,590
Now we knife.

1957
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:09,670
Oh, that's the 5-7 Chalk.

1958
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,829
Now we need Chalk specific for the gun.

1959
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:13,829
I'm going to open this door.

1960
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:15,510
Wait, what number?

1961
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:16,390
The number on the bottom left is 6.

1962
01:41:16,390 --> 01:41:17,430
Now our power is on.

1963
01:41:18,069 --> 01:41:20,550
The gun, the gun called the 5-7.

1964
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:21,829
Oh, what is happening?

1965
01:41:21,829 --> 01:41:23,510
I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.

1966
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,670
He's in that room locked in.

1967
01:41:25,670 --> 01:41:26,710
He went into like a boss fight.

1968
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:27,750
Why are you in a boss room?

1969
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,909
I didn't realize this was happening.

1970
01:41:29,909 --> 01:41:30,789
The fuck was that?

1971
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:33,189
I'm doing the boss fight without it.

1972
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:34,149
Where are my friends?

1973
01:41:34,949 --> 01:41:35,430
Out here.

1974
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:37,670
Watch out.

1975
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:39,960
Run.

1976
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:40,439
What the fuck?

1977
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:41,560
I'm in a bad spot.

1978
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:43,640
Describe it.

1979
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:45,239
They're all here.

1980
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:47,159
All the zombies are here.

1981
01:41:47,159 --> 01:41:47,720
Oh shit.

1982
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:50,850
You guys have any ideas?

1983
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:51,350
Hey.

1984
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:54,130
How do I use those axes?

1985
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:55,890
I got a DSLR.

1986
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:57,489
Be known, Kraken,

1987
01:41:57,489 --> 01:41:59,489
that I did stay at the other side of the door

1988
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:00,529
in your final moments.

1989
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:01,729
Oh, thank you.

1990
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:03,329
Throw it.

1991
01:42:03,329 --> 01:42:03,970
I don't know how to-

1992
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:04,470
Oh my God.

1993
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:09,890
Yeah, you can save me.

1994
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:11,649
I'm going to come get you.

1995
01:42:12,449 --> 01:42:13,970
We're going to have to push through.

1996
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:18,840
The music's gotten started now.

1997
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:21,159
It started like the OG-

1998
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah, I'm one of them.

1999
01:42:24,710 --> 01:42:25,750
Don't let me die.

2000
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,869
I think he's going to die.

2001
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:30,470
Oh, look at that no-scope, Jerm.

2002
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:30,949
I saw that.

2003
01:42:30,949 --> 01:42:31,350
I'm dead.

2004
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,909
Knock you.

2005
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:35,270
Geez, normal grenades.

2006
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:37,989
How the fuck do you throw secondary grenades?

2007
01:42:37,989 --> 01:42:39,670
We're going to get you out of this one, Jerma,

2008
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:40,949
but you got to give me a hot sec.

2009
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:44,689
I mean, actually, now I'm looking at it more.

2010
01:42:44,689 --> 01:42:46,130
I don't think we're going to get you out of this one.

2011
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:48,069
We should be okay.

2012
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:48,630
We should be okay.

2013
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:49,590
I mean, we'll be okay,

2014
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,590
but I don't know if I can get to him.

2015
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:52,630
How many more are there?

2016
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:53,909
Oh, we don't even know.

2017
01:42:53,909 --> 01:42:55,109
There's a lot left.

2018
01:42:55,109 --> 01:42:56,069
Oh, look out behind me.

2019
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:57,109
I'm behind you.

2020
01:42:57,109 --> 01:42:57,829
Come on in here.

2021
01:42:57,829 --> 01:42:58,310
4,400.

2022
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,949
Just get in here.

2023
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:02,310
Come on.

2024
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:04,239
I'm going to die.

2025
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:05,760
I'm running low on ammo, James.

2026
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:06,479
I'm dead.

2027
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:07,970
I'm okay.

2028
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:08,529
I got some.

2029
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:12,819
Nuke, let's go.

2030
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:15,300
Oh, you got rid of the crawler.

2031
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,579
Don't!

2032
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:17,300
No!

2033
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,500
Wait, I'm alive.

2034
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,140
You did it.

2035
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,180
Hey, we did it.

2036
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:20,680
Yay.

2037
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:23,220
I don't have any guns, though.

2038
01:43:23,779 --> 01:43:25,140
Yeah, we need to get them quick.

2039
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:25,640
Yeah.

2040
01:43:27,859 --> 01:43:29,060
That gun's good, man.

2041
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:29,859
That shotgun.

2042
01:43:29,859 --> 01:43:30,579
Oh, what's that one?

2043
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,239
Oh, what's the teddy bear?

2044
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:34,920
I'm sorry.

2045
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:37,000
Teddy bear means it goes to another location.

2046
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,479
It means you don't get to use the box.

2047
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:41,560
Oh, the box moves.

2048
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,199
Oh, no.

2049
01:43:42,199 --> 01:43:44,039
Oh, there's a sail, too.

2050
01:43:44,039 --> 01:43:45,960
No, a fire sail.

2051
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,039
We cannot survive in this room.

2052
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:49,319
We got to go.

2053
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:50,199
This one looks okay.

2054
01:43:51,239 --> 01:43:52,199
This gun is so bad.

2055
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:54,279
Blue rock.

2056
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:58,359
We got to pay that thing 500 bucks

2057
01:43:58,359 --> 01:43:59,800
or it's not going to go anywhere.

2058
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,880
All right, I'm going to you guys.

2059
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,880
I can open this fancy room.

2060
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:05,359
Oh, in here.

2061
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:06,079
In here, gang.

2062
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:06,479
In here.

2063
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:08,800
Wait, it came back.

2064
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:09,279
It came back.

2065
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:09,680
Thank god.

2066
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:11,199
The box is here, too.

2067
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,039
Use this one.

2068
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:13,920
I'll cover you.

2069
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,479
Hold for part.

2070
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:14,880
What is that?

2071
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,279
I need to touch that thing.

2072
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:18,000
What do I do with that thing?

2073
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,239
What?

2074
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,239
I don't get to touch the teddy.

2075
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,319
What did you do to the box where the box goes?

2076
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:24,079
Teddy, I didn't touch it.

2077
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:25,279
I didn't touch anything.

2078
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:26,079
He took the box.

2079
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:27,920
I didn't press any buttons at all.

2080
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,840
What's happening?

2081
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:32,149
I wanted to use that thing.

2082
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:33,750
Are you okay in there?

2083
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:33,989
No.

2084
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:36,920
I got a slot machine part.

2085
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,199
The teddy bear is over here.

2086
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,640
Whenever I walk up to something to use it,

2087
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:43,680
someone has just been there

2088
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,119
and when I try to use it, it's broken.

2089
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,800
This slot machine is on fire now.

2090
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,760
I'm out of ammo.

2091
01:44:49,479 --> 01:44:52,420
Can I make a crawler?

2092
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:52,979
I don't think I can.

2093
01:44:52,979 --> 01:44:54,340
Why did you get out of that slot machine?

2094
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,020
Because the second I tried to use it, it broke.

2095
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,500
The fire still puts them everywhere

2096
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,460
if someone's telling me so.

2097
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,579
There you go.

2098
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:01,859
You guys okay?

2099
01:45:02,659 --> 01:45:04,260
Yeah, but the teddy bear is over here.

2100
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:04,340
I made a crawler.

2101
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:04,819
You're good.

2102
01:45:04,819 --> 01:45:05,619
You can explore.

2103
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:08,020
Hold F for part.

2104
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,699
Does anyone know what the teddy bear does?

2105
01:45:09,699 --> 01:45:10,020
Hang on.

2106
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:10,579
Let me take a look.

2107
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:12,180
If there's a part on the ground,

2108
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:12,340
I found it.

2109
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:12,739
I found it.

2110
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:13,539
I see it.

2111
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:13,939
See this?

2112
01:45:13,939 --> 01:45:14,260
I found the box.

2113
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:14,579
See that?

2114
01:45:14,579 --> 01:45:15,300
See that foot?

2115
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:17,300
See that?

2116
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,500
Yeah, that's the part.

2117
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:18,739
Oh.

2118
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:21,140
When we get a couple of those,

2119
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,979
you can put them together on a bench

2120
01:45:22,979 --> 01:45:25,539
and you can make a fancy weapon.

2121
01:45:25,539 --> 01:45:26,260
It's not four.

2122
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:27,779
Nice.

2123
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:28,739
Max ammo.

2124
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:29,140
Thank you.

2125
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:29,939
Rocks.

2126
01:45:30,979 --> 01:45:31,380
Dibs.

2127
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:32,180
No.

2128
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:34,579
No me dibs, please.

2129
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:35,060
Oh my god.

2130
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,020
Oh, you have grenades.

2131
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:38,340
Yes.

2132
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:39,220
Oh.

2133
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:39,779
Yeah, nice.

2134
01:45:39,779 --> 01:45:40,739
Classic pistol.

2135
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,659
Step aside, will ya?

2136
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:43,859
Press F.

2137
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:46,840
I want to go again.

2138
01:45:48,199 --> 01:45:48,840
Sorry.

2139
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,449
What do you got?

2140
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:52,720
Not bad.

2141
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,779
What's in the mystery box?

2142
01:45:55,779 --> 01:45:57,220
How about I get like the half-life hand?

2143
01:45:58,180 --> 01:45:59,760
Where the fuck are you guys?

2144
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,119
I keep seeing that in like some weird-

2145
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,560
I keep seeing this fucking crawler over here.

2146
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:04,819
I mean, do you really have to babysit it

2147
01:46:04,819 --> 01:46:06,100
or can you like sort of leave it?

2148
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,699
It'll die on its own if you leave it.

2149
01:46:07,699 --> 01:46:08,180
Oh, will it?

2150
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,140
Well, I'll trade off with you.

2151
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:09,619
You go ahead.

2152
01:46:09,619 --> 01:46:10,180
I have no money.

2153
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,180
All right, what'd you guys do over here?

2154
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:12,739
Tag.

2155
01:46:12,739 --> 01:46:13,140
Tag me.

2156
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:15,140
Tag, you're in.

2157
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,140
Uh, how do I get in there?

2158
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,069
Can I open this door for $750?

2159
01:46:20,789 --> 01:46:22,149
Uh, skip that one because I'm on the-

2160
01:46:23,350 --> 01:46:24,609
Because I'm on the other side.

2161
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,739
Yeah, that takes us back to Swan.

2162
01:46:30,899 --> 01:46:33,380
Do you guys need somebody with more money

2163
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,819
to fucking open some more shit?

2164
01:46:35,300 --> 01:46:35,539
Yeah.

2165
01:46:35,539 --> 01:46:36,579
Don't let this thing die.

2166
01:46:36,579 --> 01:46:36,979
This one?

2167
01:46:37,539 --> 01:46:38,260
What should I open?

2168
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,260
I don't know if there's like multiple furs or what,

2169
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,539
but there's a key door over by me.

2170
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:46,579
I don't know if you can open it.

2171
01:46:47,539 --> 01:46:49,060
Wait, what happened to the zombie?

2172
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:49,539
Okay.

2173
01:46:49,539 --> 01:46:50,500
How much is the key door?

2174
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:51,619
I don't know.

2175
01:46:51,619 --> 01:46:53,140
It's over here by me.

2176
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:53,859
I'll walk over to it.

2177
01:46:53,859 --> 01:46:55,380
But I gotta make sure the zombie doesn't get too far away.

2178
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,340
Yeah, there's a key door here.

2179
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,220
He's stuck on a rock.

2180
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:59,220
I'm so fucking excited for that.

2181
01:47:00,819 --> 01:47:01,699
This one's $2000.

2182
01:47:02,739 --> 01:47:03,939
I'm holding in P for that.

2183
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:04,739
Stop looking at him.

2184
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:07,060
There's another $2000 door over here as well.

2185
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:11,590
I guess just don't be careful.

2186
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,750
One of the $2000 doors that's blue

2187
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:15,430
leads into the same room we've already opened.

2188
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:17,590
Because it is too much of a distance.

2189
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:19,029
So make sure you don't get that room.

2190
01:47:20,609 --> 01:47:23,010
Oh, I see an item room.

2191
01:47:23,010 --> 01:47:24,210
It looks like it makes a random...

2192
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:27,250
But we need the chalk for all of these guns.

2193
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,010
Seriously?

2194
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:29,569
Yeah.

2195
01:47:29,569 --> 01:47:32,130
You need to find the chalk that goes with...

2196
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:32,930
Wait, no.

2197
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:35,890
Press and hold F to pick up AN-94 chalk.

2198
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:37,409
Oh, this is like you get the chalk here

2199
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,250
and then you bring it to the room.

2200
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,050
Oh shit, okay.

2201
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,810
So I'll tell you guys which one this was over here.

2202
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:45,970
We need Uzi's chalk.

2203
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:46,470
I got it.

2204
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:47,649
Yeah, get the Uzi's chalk.

2205
01:47:47,649 --> 01:47:48,850
Put that on the wall there.

2206
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:54,020
I'll just be here babysitting the zombie.

2207
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,039
That's $1500.

2208
01:47:57,039 --> 01:47:57,840
Stop getting me...

2209
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,359
You still have to pay for it after that?

2210
01:47:59,359 --> 01:47:59,840
What the fuck?

2211
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:00,319
Yeah.

2212
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:01,039
And you gotta pay.

2213
01:48:01,039 --> 01:48:02,239
You gotta find it and pay.

2214
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:05,399
That's a good perk that we got back here.

2215
01:48:06,039 --> 01:48:06,600
Mule kick.

2216
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:08,289
God.

2217
01:48:08,930 --> 01:48:10,930
I like that everyone's getting excited for this map

2218
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:13,090
because the next one's gonna be trash.

2219
01:48:14,210 --> 01:48:14,850
Trash.

2220
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:17,159
Garbage.

2221
01:48:17,159 --> 01:48:18,119
I want to play Mario Kart.

2222
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:18,680
What's in here?

2223
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,239
I picked a lot of Mario maps

2224
01:48:21,239 --> 01:48:24,119
because they're almost as plentiful as Halloween and Christmas maps.

2225
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:27,890
Why am I getting vote kicked in my own chat?

2226
01:48:31,109 --> 01:48:31,609
What?

2227
01:48:33,699 --> 01:48:35,140
Have we gotten most of the doors?

2228
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:37,060
What's this music?

2229
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:38,260
Yeah, do you hear it?

2230
01:48:38,260 --> 01:48:39,140
Get closer to the button.

2231
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:46,640
I don't remember this being in Binding of Isaac.

2232
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:49,600
I don't think that's a part of Binding of Isaac at all.

2233
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:53,970
Hey, can I kill this stupid zombie now?

2234
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:54,470
Yeah.

2235
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:56,210
Yeah, we don't have anything else.

2236
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:00,319
Oh, it's this thing.

2237
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,899
Mule kick is three guns instead of two.

2238
01:49:02,899 --> 01:49:03,399
Oh, okay.

2239
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,460
PhD Flopper.

2240
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,420
Do you know what that is?

2241
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,260
That's the one we need to be the dolphin dive.

2242
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:10,180
Yeah, it blows up.

2243
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:13,300
Okay, I'm gonna hang out in this big square room

2244
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,640
if y'all want to join me.

2245
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:22,689
We haven't found Juggernaut, have we?

2246
01:49:23,329 --> 01:49:23,829
No.

2247
01:49:24,449 --> 01:49:27,640
What about Stamina?

2248
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,510
This one makes a cool noise.

2249
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:37,510
I feel like the Stamina one was in that first one with the blue rock

2250
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:39,590
where the slots was with the Uzi.

2251
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:41,510
This map would be good for that.

2252
01:49:43,029 --> 01:49:45,350
Guys, I got stuck.

2253
01:49:51,569 --> 01:49:53,010
I'm still learning.

2254
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:55,750
I can get you.

2255
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:57,109
I can get you.

2256
01:49:57,909 --> 01:50:01,840
I don't even know why I switched guns.

2257
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,239
Now, scroll.

2258
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,000
I thought I had the shotgun.

2259
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,720
I do.

2260
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,220
Ow!

2261
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,439
S-V-U-A-S.

2262
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:15,739
Chalk.

2263
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:18,279
Just buy my fucking custom random-

2264
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:18,920
Ray gun!

2265
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:19,880
Come on, man.

2266
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:20,380
Whatever.

2267
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:25,600
That means that my arms have never been done.

2268
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:26,399
What was that?

2269
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:27,600
Why is there a nuke right there?

2270
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:30,800
That's like a fucking pentagram.

2271
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,319
Hey, I'm standing on a pentagram.

2272
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:33,600
It's rotating around.

2273
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:34,720
Yeah, that's gonna be good.

2274
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,520
Was that you doing that?

2275
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,079
Check it off.

2276
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:37,279
Uh, maybe.

2277
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:38,720
I'm afraid to get off.

2278
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,279
Oh, fuck!

2279
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:39,920
What is that?

2280
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:40,479
I don't know.

2281
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:41,199
Oh, why?

2282
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,560
Oh, fuck.

2283
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,439
What's with the coordinates?

2284
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:46,720
What the fuck is that?

2285
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,960
Yo, there's some-

2286
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:52,239
There's some sort of ghost chasing after me right now.

2287
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:53,760
What the fuck are those things?

2288
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,319
Oh, we're on-

2289
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:55,520
Okay, we're on the same page.

2290
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,399
They spawned out of there.

2291
01:50:58,399 --> 01:50:58,800
All right.

2292
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,310
What is up with all the numbers?

2293
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,430
Is that the fucking coordinates?

2294
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,949
There's money in like-

2295
01:51:06,949 --> 01:51:07,590
Break these down!

2296
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:09,510
What are the numbers mean?

2297
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:10,069
As they come out.

2298
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,619
This is just a Mega Man password.

2299
01:51:13,619 --> 01:51:14,579
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

2300
01:51:15,699 --> 01:51:16,180
What?

2301
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,680
Cranking?

2302
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:18,460
Whoa!

2303
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,159
Oh, there's like a super one here.

2304
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:23,039
Oh, no.

2305
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:23,520
What is that noise?

2306
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,880
All right, I gotcha.

2307
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:25,359
Oh, no!

2308
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:26,739
I have no way out!

2309
01:51:26,739 --> 01:51:28,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

2310
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:28,899
I'm panicking!

2311
01:51:30,739 --> 01:51:31,539
Okay, he's-

2312
01:51:31,539 --> 01:51:32,819
Oh, shit.

2313
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:33,380
We did it.

2314
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,979
I'm gonna get you out of here.

2315
01:51:34,979 --> 01:51:35,779
Thank you.

2316
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,060
You're welcome.

2317
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:37,560
We did it.

2318
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:40,600
You know, I always got your back, James.

2319
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,000
I forgot about my secondary weapon.

2320
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,170
You guys know how to open these yet?

2321
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:46,670
More weapons.

2322
01:51:47,850 --> 01:51:48,569
Try hitting it.

2323
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:50,569
Double tap root beer.

2324
01:51:51,609 --> 01:51:52,109
Cool.

2325
01:51:54,199 --> 01:51:55,079
Hey, can I play?

2326
01:51:55,079 --> 01:51:56,199
Can I play on the slot machine?

2327
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:57,840
Yeah.

2328
01:51:58,779 --> 01:52:00,390
We'll need one more piece of that.

2329
01:52:03,029 --> 01:52:03,529
I'm dead.

2330
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,289
Oh, I won!

2331
01:52:05,289 --> 01:52:05,789
I won!

2332
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,430
Where's the-

2333
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:09,369
Where's the gun thing?

2334
01:52:09,369 --> 01:52:09,869
Where's the-

2335
01:52:09,869 --> 01:52:10,369
Where's the bomb?

2336
01:52:10,369 --> 01:52:10,869
Crawl over here.

2337
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:13,130
How do I unprone?

2338
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:15,050
Crayon, how do I get up?

2339
01:52:15,050 --> 01:52:16,090
The same way you prone.

2340
01:52:16,649 --> 01:52:17,149
I don't-

2341
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:23,819
All right, what does double tap even mean?

2342
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,720
It just means you shoot twice as fast.

2343
01:52:29,159 --> 01:52:30,119
Yeah, fast.

2344
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:30,619
Hold still.

2345
01:52:31,819 --> 01:52:32,779
God damn it.

2346
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:33,260
Hang on.

2347
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:34,220
I'll get him-

2348
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:35,579
No, you get him all for you.

2349
01:52:35,579 --> 01:52:36,079
No!

2350
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:36,579
I got a big gun.

2351
01:52:36,579 --> 01:52:37,579
No, they spawn behind me!

2352
01:52:37,579 --> 01:52:38,079
No!

2353
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:42,460
I don't know if we can make it to you, man.

2354
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:42,960
You're like-

2355
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,560
Uh, we can do it.

2356
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,359
We can do it. Let's go.

2357
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:46,319
I'm pretty far.

2358
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:47,600
He's like a mile away.

2359
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:49,359
This grenade.

2360
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:56,800
Four grenades into the chasm next to him.

2361
01:52:58,659 --> 01:52:59,220
I'm going for him.

2362
01:52:59,220 --> 01:52:59,720
I'm going for him.

2363
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:01,239
All right.

2364
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:02,979
We're with you.

2365
01:53:07,329 --> 01:53:10,449
Oh, they all go down in the chasm.

2366
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:11,329
I need a new gun.

2367
01:53:11,329 --> 01:53:12,369
I got insta-kill.

2368
01:53:16,510 --> 01:53:17,010
Yeah.

2369
01:53:17,489 --> 01:53:17,989
Fuck.

2370
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:19,250
Where's the guns?

2371
01:53:19,649 --> 01:53:21,729
All right, let's try to keep a couple of these alive now.

2372
01:53:21,729 --> 01:53:22,930
I think we're reaching the end.

2373
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:24,609
Uh, we can spend some time.

2374
01:53:26,609 --> 01:53:27,810
PhD flopper.

2375
01:53:28,529 --> 01:53:29,810
I don't know what that is, but I got it.

2376
01:53:31,069 --> 01:53:33,710
I don't know how to PhD flop in Black Ops 3.

2377
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,229
That was something in like Black Ops 1.

2378
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:37,390
Is it like control?

2379
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:38,430
No, not control.

2380
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:42,100
I just don't kill any of the zombies that are still alive.

2381
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:43,649
Maybe is it-

2382
01:53:43,649 --> 01:53:44,529
I think I want a different gun.

2383
01:53:45,489 --> 01:53:47,760
There's always the random box.

2384
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,439
You can slide with C.

2385
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:50,560
I don't know what that is.

2386
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:51,060
Oh shit.

2387
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,159
Wow, you can.

2388
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,960
Where's the box at?

2389
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:57,840
I got a fucking teddy.

2390
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,000
Oh, it's right here now.

2391
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,880
Uh, it looks like it changes spots, actually.

2392
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:05,979
All right, I'm going to open this.

2393
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:08,060
I don't even know if this is-

2394
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:09,579
this goes to anything, honestly.

2395
01:54:11,699 --> 01:54:12,659
That's like the last zombie.

2396
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:13,300
Wait, what's this?

2397
01:54:13,859 --> 01:54:14,340
Oh, god damn it.

2398
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:15,380

Deadshot Dakiri.

2402
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,619

How do I do the flop thing before saying okay, I just got another m time what the fuck these are like

2409
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:07,720
Mass-produced these things are bad. That's what I just got. I just got one. Oh, oh good. Oh

2410
01:55:08,359 --> 01:55:10,359
Now there goes there. Oh god

01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:13,960
What lady a second m tar and then flew away?

2412
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:18,939
Was this the door that you guys said you already unlocked on the other side this blue door here?

2413
01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:25,779
That's in this blue room. No, I hang on stay there. That's a team. That's a 2,000

2414
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:32,100
Check I'm gonna go to where as close as I can get to that side and see if it's actually like a space or not

2415
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:38,960
Well, should we kill this guy? No, I got okay. I got a tinted rock over here James

2416
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:44,640
There's no way we've been there before well somebody has enough points to open it. I've spent so many points. I do things

2417
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:47,039
Okay, I'll open it. I'll

2418
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:50,159
I'll take the hit

2419
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:53,680
If any guys know what a vulture aid is is $3,000 and it's right over here. I

2420
01:55:54,279 --> 01:55:57,199
Would have spent all my $2,000 plus another thousand

2421
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:05,279
The fuck oh, this is uh, it's like a super gold key room for another 2k and

2422
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:09,439
Then over here we know let you see everything. I

2423
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:19,500
Want to go in the super gold key room? What's that? What's that? You see that see that bottle?

2424
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:28,739
The bottle shoot it. I think I think it's a part, isn't it? So what's the story?

2425
01:56:29,260 --> 01:56:35,140
Are we doing a little 11? Oh, how many rounds through these blues? Yeah, you see this right here. Wait, wait

2426
01:56:35,659 --> 01:56:41,340
Boys, they spawn random. Uh, see this. Well, I was shot fenders. Oh, it's a secret. Oh

2427
01:56:41,859 --> 01:56:48,279
It is a wall, but it's probably a secret wall. We need a grenade step back. Oh

2428
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:54,060
It rolls

2429
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:04,130
I hope

2430
01:57:05,329 --> 01:57:07,329
We're gonna wipe and die

2431
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:14,890
They drop grenades and kill themselves and then I

2432
01:57:16,210 --> 01:57:22,189
This thing and I was on it when they threw them including my own grenade. I can't jump over this

2433
01:57:22,949 --> 01:57:26,850
Why oh my god

2434
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:35,680
Well, you know that was good that was a good second time

2435
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,880
I don't know if it's random every game or not. I'm gonna assume no

2436
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:44,350
It fell in the hole. My monkey bomb fell in the hole didn't work

2437
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:49,489
Hey, well black ops 3 is pretty fun game. It's first time I've ever opened it

2438
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:56,850
Yeah worth the 60 bucks in three years. I hope you liked the one good map. We played man cuz

2439
01:57:57,369 --> 01:57:59,989
Next is Candyland. It was still 60 bucks

2440
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:07,260
Yep, you think it's ever gonna drop price. No, I thought maybe wait five nights at Freddy's zombies, dude

2441
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:12,140
I totally grabbed that pog dude wants to do was to put five minutes of ready hog, dude

2442
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:14,899
Five nights at Freddy's

2443
01:58:15,020 --> 01:58:17,020
Let me see if that one's already for me yet. I

2444
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:29,359
Got Candyland ready for sure. Okay, let's do can't land and then five nights of Fred. Yeah, that'll be ready after that

2445
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:32,279
I think after like that level I'll be caught up

2446
01:58:35,289 --> 01:58:40,649
I mean, hey, you gotta give you this game credit. They made itself. They made this game really moddable

2447
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:50,239
For I'm surprised you can put this much stuff in here. Yeah, it's I mean, I think that's I think it's really impressive

2448
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:55,920
It's a shame. They'll probably never let people mod a game this much again. All right. I need more alcohol for this

2449
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,840
I'm gonna get it be back

2450
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,960

2562
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:24,180
I don't think these zombies can cut across the invisible walls

2563
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:27,260
So they have to go down the whole thing and they can spawn on us though

2564
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:31,859
They can't spot like he's they're cutting across these guys. Those ones are fresh fun. Oh

2565
02:09:33,699 --> 02:09:35,939
No, these ones jump over them back

2566
02:09:36,739 --> 02:09:43,039
So they can't spawn in front of us, but what is this terrible PNG of blood?

before I talked

2630
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:11,020
It's like the second the game window opens. I will say the saw ones are usually inspired

2631
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:12,620
saw ones

2632
02:17:12,620 --> 02:17:17,620
I feel like they were so inspired that I think we forgot already having done this one and just completely

2633
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:20,819
Like forgot about it because I'm pretty sure we did every song

2634
02:17:22,459 --> 02:17:24,459
To really to

2635
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:31,739

Okay, I can't guarantee the how good that one

2643
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:14,520
I can I personally vetted every single one of these levels to make sure they were

2644
02:18:15,159 --> 02:18:20,280
The absolute peak of quality that we come to expect from black ops 3 co-op

2645
02:18:21,719 --> 02:18:26,079
Seems like they want the spongebob one. That's why you can find if you scroll through the list

Like, you know why I have so much presence there

2654
02:19:02,379 --> 02:19:06,940

2824
02:33:49,959 --> 02:33:52,559
Thing sucks. Yeah, that's

02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:01,600
Help you know fucking rocket. I mean rockets are shit. I'm not super thrilled about this thing

02:34:02,239 --> 02:34:05,920
Got a lot of ammo for apparently there's a juggernaut by the chum bucket

2827
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:09,530
Might be worth an investigation. Okay

2828
02:34:10,129 --> 02:34:13,139
That's the bacon mark chum bucket

2829
02:34:13,739 --> 02:34:21,700
Where's the chum? Oh, it's right next to the it's right there. I see it down this room. What the fuck?

Wait, why we need a crawler? Oh, I didn't realize that was

2831
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:30,770

2832
02:34:30,770 --> 02:34:36,010
Shit, where is it over here? It's up here. We should do this anyways, cuz there's a box here

2833
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:39,690
We need to get souls into I have no way. This is the chum bucket

2834
02:34:40,409 --> 02:34:42,090

Juggernaut was near chum bucket somebody said over here. I have no ammo come this way cranking. I'm covering you

Right on me. We know Tommy. Oh, there's anyone has enough money. I do I do

2837
02:34:57,319 --> 02:35:00,180
We want to kill stuff by this box. I think that's how we get the keys

02:35:02,370 --> 02:35:05,250
handcuffs over there

2839
02:35:05,850 --> 02:35:07,850

Extra hits before you go down. All right, just don't kill the car. There's one right there, dude. I'm gonna cut this one

2846
02:36:00,110 --> 02:36:06,319

2851
02:36:25,819 --> 02:36:30,700
I mean if you kill this thing, you can actually have enough to both open the pack a punch door and pack a punch

2852
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:35,340
Probably or be close. I could open the gate. It's over here. It's by the gate

2853
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:37,739
I just cast do it do it do it all this cash

2854
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:45,950
Would that would that push you up enough is that would that get you 180 if you like our every hit on this guy

2855
02:36:46,510 --> 02:36:49,510
Punch, I don't have enough. It's I'm on

2856
02:36:49,870 --> 02:36:53,790
If you shoot this guy like a couple of times in the body then finish him off with a knife

2857
02:36:53,790 --> 02:36:56,909
What is this percacola? You can get a percacola over here

2858
02:36:57,590 --> 02:36:59,590
That a random perk

2859
02:37:00,030 --> 02:37:02,030
dig dig

2860
02:37:04,229 --> 02:37:07,069
It's loud it's loud it's loud it's loud it's loud tell me to dig

2861
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:11,190
Hey

2862
02:37:11,190 --> 02:37:16,799
He's getting in here. It gives you a random perk on the road. You can dig on the road

2863
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:24,579
You know James. I genuinely think if you shoot this thing like a couple times and knife him you'll get enough for dig

2864
02:37:25,420 --> 02:37:29,930
But do I but is there any more progress that we can do with money?

2865
02:37:30,930 --> 02:37:33,790
No, no, I think you should buy a good gun. I think it's time to get

2866
02:37:35,329 --> 02:37:38,270
You guys seen this dig

2867
02:37:38,350 --> 02:37:44,329
Somebody said they dig I see it. I see it's just a skull. I know I've been doing that all the time

2868
02:37:44,329 --> 02:37:47,129
It doesn't look like it doesn't do it. No, okay. I did it

2869
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:50,850
Well, I think I'm the only one who got the hang on

2870
02:37:50,850 --> 02:37:54,290
I'm gonna run around with the shovel and dig all this stuff. Oh, I got one

2871
02:37:54,290 --> 02:38:00,110
I just got one you got a key. So they're in okay. The keys are in the skull part in the skull piles. All right

2872
02:38:00,649 --> 02:38:03,500
It's a search around before we kill this last one

2873
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:07,540
Yeah, I don't know about you guys my chest has literally just been quoting spongebob for the last hour

2874
02:38:08,139 --> 02:38:12,540
What'd you expect? Also, I mean we've only played for like 20 minutes. So it's sort of weird. They've been going for

2875
02:38:13,579 --> 02:38:15,579
It's really like spongebob, dude

2876
02:38:15,899 --> 02:38:21,700
Your place is safe haven for their community 2000. I got one key here. So

2877
02:38:22,819 --> 02:38:27,799
Squidward

2878
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:34,639
What is the fucking pile look like follow me? It's a weird muddy skull pile like bones and dirt mud

2879
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,520
debris

2880
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:39,120
Ah

2881
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:45,190
Am I just follow? Yeah, I'm just following cracking because of me. I got no money and I got no money either pal

2882
02:38:45,389 --> 02:38:47,389
We're just kind of walking around

2883
02:38:49,590 --> 02:38:53,350
You found one is one yeah, there's a there's a pile here if you want see what it looks like

2884
02:38:54,469 --> 02:38:58,989
It looks exactly like a pile of garbage with bones in it. There's a wait

2885
02:38:59,989 --> 02:39:01,989
Wait, oh, that's not it

2886
02:39:03,629 --> 02:39:06,430
Wait James, we got open this the store over here. See that. Oh

02:39:13,950 --> 02:39:17,149
Got one. I'm gonna kill this motherfucker. All right, wait

02:39:28,139 --> 02:39:31,020
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm not kidding. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I

2891
02:39:31,899 --> 02:39:38,899
Was locked myself with the boat and I was died it's easy to do that

2892
02:39:43,209 --> 02:39:48,170
Well, I don't I didn't see any more places to get keys which makes me believe that it's still that those like soul

2893
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:50,170
Boxes crying I dare you to shoot him

2894
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:53,540
Okay, you did you actually did?

02:39:54,139 --> 02:39:56,639
All right now do you need to shoot him?

2896

I still didn't get enough. No, all right guys open this open this

2897
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:10,100
Key, okay. I'm telling you guys the rest of them. We got to kill zombies near these boxes

2898
02:40:10,260 --> 02:40:13,979
Those take the souls of the zombies. Oh bad. That's true

2899
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:28,760

They're behind you guys well my leg that was the worst

2902
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:04,829
Yeah, I've seen the pop-up before too I got the bridge

2903
02:41:05,590 --> 02:41:15,850
They're spawning you all behind us. They're trying to spawn behind

2904
02:41:16,649 --> 02:41:20,770
Markers. Oh, oh it gave us a nuke. All right, these things are garbage. We don't need them

2905
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:25,110
We're gonna have to hunt these keys

2906
02:41:26,909 --> 02:41:33,709
Creativity and ingenuity. Okay, so there's another way to our right. Yeah, right here. Okay. Oh, there is

2907
02:41:34,309 --> 02:41:36,350
Packing pack a punch. Oh shit

2908
02:41:36,909 --> 02:41:38,909
Pack a punch M16

2909
02:41:39,069 --> 02:41:41,700
Wait, don't kill

2910
02:41:41,819 --> 02:41:43,819
Why?

2911
02:41:45,059 --> 02:41:49,739
Oops, oops, oops. Why are you this way? Wait, what do you what do you need? I want pack a punch

2912
02:41:49,739 --> 02:41:55,940
Pack a punch you need five thousand. You put it back in here. Oh, I only have four thousand

2913
02:41:58,670 --> 02:42:04,329
Put in whatever gun you want and it'll like make it a super a super gun. It'll be objectively

2914
02:42:05,069 --> 02:42:07,069
Nice. All right. Yeah, I'm gonna try

2915
02:42:08,069 --> 02:42:11,190
But then definitely don't die cuz you'll lose that. I will

2916
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:21,600
Be like fail fish is like every five seconds. Yeah, I'm gonna do it and 16 right let's do it

2917
02:42:26,229 --> 02:42:33,010
Dude, no, this is giving me some hit markers completed

2918
02:42:33,969 --> 02:42:40,729
Completed what I finished the the route taxi. I'm gonna go back to super again. I got a legendary

2919
02:42:41,569 --> 02:42:46,409
How do you know that dude? You want to play even press F on this?

2920
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:55,639
trade your pack of

2921
02:42:57,559 --> 02:43:05,540
Keys what I want to see if this is possible. All right guys, I'm pretty sure can you put it on there?

2922
02:43:05,540 --> 02:43:07,719
Yeah, I can cheese. Yeah, that's bad

2923
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:10,799
So it's a crawler don't kill the crawler this time's a

2924
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:18,600
How do I do it I don't know if we can make it to

2925
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:27,719
Someone's gotta keep them off me. I go for you. Keep them off. There's no spawning here as well behind you

2926
02:43:27,719 --> 02:43:32,799
I'm not gonna be able to do it. I mean, there's no one here. I mean there were people

2927
02:43:32,799 --> 02:43:36,479
That's why I was to 50% health right away. I got me baby

2928
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:40,280
Alright, so I got the second key crawler right here

2929
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:42,559
I'm okay sure

2930
02:43:50,159 --> 02:43:53,120
I wasn't just gonna do that if I didn't know good

2931
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:56,540
The binding of Isaac level I'm not gonna jump off

2932
02:43:59,559 --> 02:44:05,760
Here I think we've got a feed the souls to little shiny boxes cuz we've gotten two keys two different ways

2933
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,760
I think it's the third way

2934
02:44:08,639 --> 02:44:13,799
Pathway that you opened is that it that's it the race. Yeah, all I got all we got from the shiny box

2935
02:44:13,799 --> 02:44:15,600
It was here was a nuke

2936
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,899
Yeah, but we didn't get anything from the other holes that we dug. So

2937
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:23,399
You don't want to do one more pass through and look around. I'm

2938
02:44:24,719 --> 02:44:27,959
Unity here sure nothing else is viable

2939
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:30,760
nothing is double-tabble

2940
02:44:30,799 --> 02:44:32,799
double-tap over there by you cracking

2941
02:44:33,639 --> 02:44:40,200
I think was bomb stoppers. Oh bomb floppers bomb floppers. That's what I did when I killed us all into Isaac one

2942
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:46,549
I think double-tap was by the beginning was it all the way back there

2943
02:44:47,450 --> 02:44:50,690
I'm over here. Now. I'll look for you. It's quick reload around here

2944
02:44:54,159 --> 02:44:58,040
Over by me is double-tap German get that

2945
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:05,090
Way, oh, that's a long pretty pretty pretty close to oh, I fucking bought the wrong one

2946
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:10,329
That's a kick in the pants guys. No, I'm not gonna get you'll kick. I'll get something else. I

2947
02:45:11,010 --> 02:45:14,979
Just get the random one

2948
02:45:14,979 --> 02:45:17,459
Random one is pretty good. If you have enough money to just like

2949
02:45:18,459 --> 02:45:23,139
100 of them might as well bang bang. There it is double-tap. Oh my god, that's loud

2950
02:45:23,979 --> 02:45:25,979
What?

2951
02:45:26,459 --> 02:45:36,600
Is there any paths we somehow miss was that quick reload that I just actually get creek fucking reload what the fuck

2952
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,120
All right, we're gonna put our

2953
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:46,000
That's amazing. I don't know. I was trying to see if there was any like paths be missed because we're still

2954
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:48,879
That's okay

2955
02:45:51,909 --> 02:45:56,950
Little box that I know I know there's one box that's over here that I had to buy a thing to get to some pretty

2956
02:45:56,950 --> 02:46:01,829
That's it one box by the Krusty Krab. I'm gonna get one box that shows that maybe it's one over here

2957
02:46:02,309 --> 02:46:06,430
Well, look, I had to literally it's the corner of the map and I had to buy a way to get into it

2958
02:46:06,430 --> 02:46:08,430
There's nothing else here. So I figure if anything

2959
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:10,870
Inside the car, what was that?

2960
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:16,030
James what no. Oh, I thought that was a zombie. No buying perks

2961
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:19,200
Okay. Hmm

2962
02:46:19,319 --> 02:46:21,799
Electricity electric cherry was good, but I only used it once

2963
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:28,559
Yeah, electric sure is really good when every other perk is stacked with it because you're like reloading faster and moving faster

2964
02:46:28,559 --> 02:46:30,559
So you're headed more shit

2965
02:46:32,899 --> 02:46:36,819
If we make it through a couple more rounds without going down, we pretty much what is that go?

2966
02:46:37,540 --> 02:46:40,299
It's the widow one. I don't even know what the fuck the widow one does

2967
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:43,739
That one gives you a special kind of grenade. Oh

2968
02:46:46,260 --> 02:46:50,719
Watch out the guys are still if you just stepped on the crawler

2969
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:58,059
Their cluster grenades, ooh, maybe the race is to get the key

2970
02:46:58,819 --> 02:47:05,860
He got one from the race. Oh, they already got one. Okay. Yeah, why is he not aggro bastards confused?

2971
02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:07,860
He doesn't know who to go after anyone

2972
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:11,540
Fuck I can get one stock here the boat

2973
02:47:12,180 --> 02:47:15,510
I'm a kill. I'm a kill him

2974
02:47:15,510 --> 02:47:22,819
No, try to stop me stay away from him try to stop me rip. What the fuck is that one?

2975
02:47:23,299 --> 02:47:27,840
Wait, did you get tombstone? It's rip

2976
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:33,559
Yeah, when you die, you're gonna drop a tombstone, which will mean that when you've respawn you can recollect your perks

2977
02:47:34,239 --> 02:47:36,239
Nice

2978
02:47:37,159 --> 02:47:43,719
Over here guys turn left if there's one thing I know it's call of duty black ops 3 perks and

2979
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:47,840
Their various this is where the shiny box is. Oh

2980
02:47:50,079 --> 02:47:54,079
This place already filled up though. No. Oh, this is this

2981
02:47:55,079 --> 02:47:58,299
Camp in this corner. Yeah, this is why I've been telling you all along

2982
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:01,659
90 I'll believe me. I

2983
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:04,260
Still don't want to do

2984
02:48:05,420 --> 02:48:07,420
How many got a kill

2985
02:48:10,459 --> 02:48:13,139
You see those little orbs that go into it those are their souls

2986
02:48:21,520 --> 02:48:27,969
My god get your face out of my face

2987
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:33,840
You would think that it has enough by now. Yeah, it's got like a hundred people

2988
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:43,559
Yeah, we gotta wait sir closer, how could you tell when it actually got finished

2989
02:48:44,459 --> 02:48:46,459
Disappeared there's a pickup

02:48:50,799 --> 02:48:52,799
Boots

2991
02:48:55,440 --> 02:49:01,180

2992
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,799
Do you get any items? Oh, it's only something cash. Oh

2993
02:49:05,360 --> 02:49:17,309
Behind you behind you we gotta get out of here go to the Christmas crab advantage of the sail

2994

2995
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:33,579
Somewhere right? Yeah. Yeah, it's oh and the box here too. I put a lot of work into that box

2996
02:49:34,899 --> 02:49:36,899
This box should be ready to go

2997
02:49:37,299 --> 02:49:39,780
What is this? I have money to I'm gonna buy

2998
02:49:41,780 --> 02:49:46,760

It's like nowhere to someone should watch the back just oh, yeah

3000
02:49:57,479 --> 02:49:58,760
This way

3001
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:06,479
And then it's it for now. Well, unless there's one maybe like a

3002
02:50:07,280 --> 02:50:09,280
No, there's a couple more

3003
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:14,569
Electricity thing now. I'm gonna get this again. I might get it, too

3004
02:50:16,250 --> 02:50:17,850
Yeah, there it is

3005
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:20,649
Souls complete reward is in the spawn zone. Yeah

3006
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:23,170
Let's stick together here

3007
02:50:23,170 --> 02:50:26,850
This is gonna be it. This is gonna be our key our key out of here

3008
02:50:27,370 --> 02:50:30,530
Is this gonna be one key? Oh or it's gonna be three guns

3009
02:50:31,049 --> 02:50:38,020
What's three guns? I can't wait for this to be what kills me. What's

3010
02:50:39,659 --> 02:50:43,819
The round isn't over yet. Ah

3011
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:50,340
Yeah, there's more people's being over there pack a punch holes. Okay. They're good though. Yeah

3012
02:50:51,020 --> 02:50:53,020
These are high tier guns

3013
02:50:53,780 --> 02:50:57,549
Alright, we're hiding here today. Let's get that fucking key

3014
02:50:58,430 --> 02:51:04,579
They fucking spawn right on top of us. What the fuck we don't have any other options. I

3015
02:51:05,459 --> 02:51:14,399
Don't got it somewhere in there. Oh, they're all gonna strike

3016
02:51:16,559 --> 02:51:24,989
Wait, there's infinite ammo. I see it. We're gods of a little back up. Okay

3017
02:51:26,229 --> 02:51:29,700
I got it. It was Max and the time warp. We're good

3018
02:51:31,950 --> 02:51:35,309
We're free with this much ammo in the chamber. How can it be?

3019
02:51:36,030 --> 02:51:38,459
There's only behind this again

3020
02:51:38,459 --> 02:51:43,049
Nothing fine over towards Kraken because I I'm too strong

3021
02:51:44,350 --> 02:51:48,909
Where is the where's the junk dog thing? Oh right there. I'll take a left

3022
02:51:50,790 --> 02:51:57,680
Nice you don't you just get a couple of times turned around looked at me

3023
02:51:58,959 --> 02:52:06,860
All right, we gotta figure out what this oh, you gotta beat this love there

3024
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:11,500
Or let's think who have you not talked to who who's not giving us a quest

3025
02:52:12,729 --> 02:52:15,450
Larry Larry's had Larry's been keeping his mouth. Whoa

3026
02:52:18,379 --> 02:52:23,420
Larry the lobster Larry looks like he's pointing at some dude. I just watch you kill a crawler

3027
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:28,799
I just watched you pointing run up and kill my crawler. Are you talking to me? Yeah, I'm talking to you

3028
02:52:28,860 --> 02:52:32,819
No, you better not be talking to me because I fucking saw you do it. No one else here

3029
02:52:35,180 --> 02:52:37,180
You guys have a crawler over there

3030
02:52:37,420 --> 02:52:40,700
Last one just blew up your crawler. No, we don't have one. Oh, okay

3031
02:52:40,739 --> 02:52:45,299
There's a running crazed guy over here by me. So leave that guy alive

3032
02:52:47,299 --> 02:52:51,940
Drink what is this? I'm gonna pack up. I'm so loud. Oh, it's loud. All right, it's

3033
02:52:52,379 --> 02:52:56,780
Holy shit with the pack a puncher. It's like over by the key to it. All right, send it

3034
02:52:56,780 --> 02:53:01,930
I have ten thousand points. I'm gonna need more perks

3035
02:53:02,610 --> 02:53:08,450
Any more drinks dude fill up on all the perks, dude. I'm uh, I'm on babysit duty right now

3036
02:53:09,010 --> 02:53:11,809
I can babysit swap for you. All right

3037
02:53:12,329 --> 02:53:16,889
I need to use your comprehensive lore of spongebob to explain where the third key

3038
02:53:16,889 --> 02:53:21,149
Where did spongebob and Patrick hide the final key? Yeah, where did they hide the final key?

3039
02:53:22,010 --> 02:53:28,329
The key of the STG 44. What do you think I try checking garbage cans?

3040
02:53:28,690 --> 02:53:32,870
That's what I thought they look at the garbage cans in this map seem a little bit too high-detail

3041
02:53:35,969 --> 02:53:38,149
Just get the box

3042
02:53:39,629 --> 02:53:41,850
Davy Jones locker the lid

3043
02:53:42,989 --> 02:53:47,989
Okay, everyone's saying the lid. All right, I get it. You know, it's one of my memes what the little

3044
02:53:49,709 --> 02:53:54,879
Okay, 47

3045
02:53:54,879 --> 02:53:56,879
so you guys do puzzle work, I'll just

3046
02:53:57,520 --> 02:53:59,520
Babysit this Dutchman for a while

3047
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:07,049
Light beam, okay

3048
02:54:10,610 --> 02:54:16,049
The lid the lid the lid it wasn't everyone's screaming about the lid everyone's young I must be the lid guys

3049
02:54:16,209 --> 02:54:20,290
It's unanimously the lid all the lid the lid. I know anything about that

3050
02:54:20,969 --> 02:54:24,649
Did they mean like sewer vent like a lid for honestly?

3051
02:54:24,649 --> 02:54:27,930
It could be opening the final door because we've opened all the mix it for the one over here. So

3052
02:54:28,409 --> 02:54:33,209
All right, dude, what just happened? Well, I was looking I was trying to go towards like the beam of light and oh

3053
02:54:34,129 --> 02:54:37,409
Here you just want to come over to me. You distracted my zombie

3054
02:54:38,049 --> 02:54:44,280
What is happening? Oh my god, I need a hyper. I think German needs to go over here

3055
02:54:44,319 --> 02:54:46,319
It's right here, right?

3056
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:48,399
this

3057
02:54:48,399 --> 02:54:50,399
bus bus bus bus bus

3058
02:54:51,399 --> 02:54:54,159
I need a weapon. I'm gonna power back

3059
02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:04,559
Thanks, right. Does he suck? Huh? Who's he? I mean you could get a better gun. Yeah. Yeah from the box. I

3060
02:55:05,159 --> 02:55:09,760
Did not miss a dig site. I'm looking what sort of was sort of past the phase where we settle for

3061
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:12,680
Yeah, that's true

3062
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:14,850
sack three

3063
02:55:14,930 --> 02:55:16,090
thing

3064
02:55:16,090 --> 02:55:18,450
Looks like a dual wield, which means it shoots pretty fast

3065
02:55:19,049 --> 02:55:23,450
Probably good pack a punched. Yeah, let's pack punch this thing. I don't know. Did you guys figure out how to dive yet?

3066
02:55:23,450 --> 02:55:27,989
Oh easy easy. You can't afford the pack a punch. I think they needed to open up a debris hole

3067
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:30,530
Yeah back this spawn

3068
02:55:34,889 --> 02:55:36,889
I'm just gonna run this way for a sec. I

3069
02:55:37,930 --> 02:55:42,250
Don't have enough money. I will in a minute though. It's like just like holding this

3070
02:55:42,569 --> 02:55:43,850
No, oh

3071
02:55:43,850 --> 02:55:46,649
All right. They're apparently we missed one. Oh, there's the last dig site

3072
02:55:47,129 --> 02:55:53,170
Maybe double pack the fist gun you can double pack. I thought they just gave you more ammo fuck

3073
02:55:54,569 --> 02:55:56,569
Nothing. No

3074
02:55:57,610 --> 02:56:01,049
James does double packing do anything in this or does it just refill your ammo?

3075
02:56:01,329 --> 02:56:06,719
Uh, I don't know if they added that in like a later thing

3076
02:56:06,719 --> 02:56:10,079
I know all these zombie games merged for me after we need it

3077
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:12,840
This this door right here

3078
02:56:14,239 --> 02:56:16,000
You see where I am

3079
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:19,200
Yeah, this is the last one. We haven't open

3080
02:56:19,479 --> 02:56:22,280
That just goes back to the beginning. Yeah, but maybe it's okay

3081
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:25,959
I was hoping it's gonna like give us a little shortcut opened all the doors thing

3082
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,040
double packing gives special ammo

3083
02:56:29,440 --> 02:56:35,569
Dude, what the fuck? Where's spongebob hiding his special treasure?

3084
02:56:36,129 --> 02:56:38,129
No, no, we kind of

3085
02:56:39,170 --> 02:56:41,170
There's another power switch here. Oh

3086
02:56:42,809 --> 02:56:44,969
Racing stripes we exhausted all options

3087
02:56:45,569 --> 02:56:51,159
Power switch people are saying I pulled another switch right there. We did the power though. It's by the gate

3088
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:55,100
No, there's more than one power. This one activates only one of the vending machines though

3089
02:56:55,100 --> 02:57:02,440
Check that maybe we're missing power on the side of every vending machine is its own power. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's true

3090
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:05,440
One over here as well that's already broken

3091
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:08,840
We're mr. Krabs. Don't you can't talk to mr. Krabs?

3092
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:12,000
No, mr. Krabs. Don't talk. He's dead

3093
02:57:12,719 --> 02:57:15,559
That's just oh wait shoot all the Aquaman's

3094
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:19,280
I've made man to man man to man

3095
02:57:20,079 --> 02:57:22,079
man to man

3096
02:57:22,719 --> 02:57:26,979
Alright, I see it. No, that's just a blue

3097
02:57:28,180 --> 02:57:30,180
Yeah

3098
02:57:33,899 --> 02:57:36,780
Okay

3099
02:57:40,229 --> 02:57:47,350
I don't have them. Oh, I had them. Oh shit. Get it. We we did it. What is this press F

3100
02:57:48,149 --> 02:57:50,149
50,000

3101
02:57:50,629 --> 02:57:55,790
Welcome to my game. I fucking hate you're gonna have to pay another 50,000 to get

3102
02:57:58,469 --> 02:58:00,469
What the fuck

3103
02:58:01,549 --> 02:58:03,549
50 grand here time

3104
02:58:04,110 --> 02:58:10,709
I'll have like a punch stuff. This should be okay. Yeah, just try it once and see how fast it goes up because they're right like if

3105
02:58:11,629 --> 02:58:13,629
Standing here. They don't spawn in here. We just

3106
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:16,709
Shoot like crazy. I'll watch I'll watch behind it

3107
02:58:18,549 --> 02:58:21,840
See how see if it goes make sure you guys prone

3108
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,639
extra accuracy

3109
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:29,469
Yeah, no, this should be super easy if none spawn back here. This should be like like a two-round

3110
02:58:30,309 --> 02:58:37,229
Not two rounds not to run I was I was thinking more of like if someone

3111
02:58:38,510 --> 02:58:47,090
Yeah, nothing's spawning in here. We're good. So this is one person. I'm gonna shoot every enemy

3112
02:58:51,170 --> 02:58:55,930
Just shoot every enemy well, we just cover it. All right covering

3113
02:58:56,649 --> 02:59:03,940
What was that? That's a super loud coal emission

3114
02:59:05,079 --> 02:59:09,870
Which lets me see Oh vulture lets you see every pickup on the map

3115
02:59:10,510 --> 02:59:21,700
So this is just practice for you practice for you almost there. I mean honestly ten percent

3116
02:59:24,959 --> 02:59:31,690
Hey, I mean this is this is how you actually wouldn't go up black ops and this is an actual

3117
02:59:32,809 --> 02:59:35,440
Yeah

3118
02:59:36,239 --> 02:59:41,790
Fun just watching next map is gonna be KFC

3119
02:59:42,389 --> 02:59:44,389
So enjoy this

3120
02:59:46,069 --> 02:59:49,950
I'll throw a grenade though. It's like bring it out. Actually. Now's a good chance

3121
02:59:50,590 --> 02:59:55,629
Chats one for McDonald's two for KFC three for Taco Bell make your decision

3122
02:59:56,430 --> 02:59:58,989
Which three separate food maps to do

3123
03:00:00,389 --> 03:00:09,799
Somebody can pack a punch again. Okay. I'm seeing a lot of threes in there. I see this blood and glory

3124
03:00:10,719 --> 03:00:13,219
That's cool

3125
03:00:13,219 --> 03:00:20,229
Now we get a max ammo out of this sir, I'm gonna run out of these

3126
03:00:24,709 --> 03:00:27,790
Sorry, man, I'm getting the last couple of my purge come unstoppable

3127
03:00:28,590 --> 03:00:36,149
18 only it looks like four more of those. Wait am I saving up now? Yeah, you're saying you got $50,000

3128
03:00:38,590 --> 03:00:41,069
Fuck

3129
03:00:41,069 --> 03:00:43,069
You're a savior money your money

3130
03:00:44,069 --> 03:00:59,430
Well seems just like enough time to run an ad on my channel thanks guys for watching all this I did

3131
03:01:05,270 --> 03:01:07,750
He rent like you read like a hundred ads on

3132
03:01:08,149 --> 03:01:13,069
I mean so much money no idea work. Did it make you know actually was not

3133
03:01:16,350 --> 03:01:21,790
No, I'm not up to warrant all the the unfollows I got so at your own expense

3134
03:01:23,069 --> 03:01:24,790
run the ads

3135
03:01:24,790 --> 03:01:28,739
It was easily like a quarter of the stream

3136
03:01:31,819 --> 03:01:39,250
Career suicide exactly wait. I made it feel that if someone were to gift me a sub I would run an ad so

3137
03:01:42,350 --> 03:01:45,709
This is not gonna be worth it you're gonna open that it's gonna just say oh no

3138
03:01:45,709 --> 03:01:49,989
It's gonna instantly send us to the gate. It's essentially you pay to game over the key

3139
03:01:51,989 --> 03:01:55,389
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be credit for the easy to channel. I can't wait

3140
03:01:56,670 --> 03:01:58,549
15,000

3141
03:01:58,549 --> 03:02:01,989
This was an interesting map of straight lines

3142
03:02:03,069 --> 03:02:08,209
Roads, I'm gonna run out of ammo. I might have to like pack a punch again

3143
03:02:09,889 --> 03:02:11,690
No

3144
03:02:11,690 --> 03:02:18,239
You always have to buy that's gonna set us back. Oh, I know I know but like I have nothing

3145
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:26,719
So they're like starting to get to us to well, I'm not firing at them. I'm running out of ammo to actually

3146
03:02:27,719 --> 03:02:47,129
You're gonna get to like 42,000. We're gonna all have no ammo. I'm gonna piss a bear bear

3147
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:56,459
How's there not been a max ammo yet Jesus

3148
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:06,579
We're too far away from them. No, there's there's perks popping up. There's drops. It's just not a good

3149
03:03:06,700 --> 03:03:11,899
I'm any good ones. All right, I am out of ammo. So fun. I'm running out too

3150
03:03:11,899 --> 03:03:16,459
I should pack a punch real quick. No, I don't know don't don't I have 20

3151
03:03:16,459 --> 03:03:22,700
No, he should I barely have any animal either in German's peeing man. I we need ammo. No, no, no, no

3152
03:03:24,780 --> 03:03:27,459
Not as much it's not as much it's only 2,500

3153
03:03:28,180 --> 03:03:32,959
Okay, it actually didn't give me any ammo. It filled up

3154
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:43,319
It gave me an extra perk. I don't know what the fuck that even does for me. But oh

3155
03:03:44,709 --> 03:03:47,700
God, when is he coming back?

3156
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:51,520
I don't know, but I need to pack a punch now

3157
03:03:52,520 --> 03:03:58,379
Wait, did we get one? Oh, that's a death machine

3158
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:12,780
Weak it's it's weak compared to I pack a punch this thing. It didn't even give me any ammo. We're gonna die here

3159
03:04:15,440 --> 03:04:17,440
I have no way of helping

3160
03:04:25,739 --> 03:04:27,739

3163
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:35,219
He's dead

3164
03:04:35,219 --> 03:04:37,219
There's nothing we can do

3165
03:04:37,260 --> 03:04:41,059
Get him up. Maybe you won't notice if you get him up. There's no dude. There's no hammer

3166

There's no fucking

3170
03:04:59,370 --> 03:05:01,370
I know I know I have an idea

3171
03:05:01,409 --> 03:05:04,360
If we take a wall

3172
03:05:04,399 --> 03:05:09,329
Item now we can probably switch it to pack a punch. I'm down

3173
03:05:09,969 --> 03:05:15,389
You're down. What do you mean? You're down? Oh, what was that sound over here pack a punch?

3175
03:05:23,440 --> 03:05:27,920
No, I'm dead. No, I am completely out of everything that I have in my image

3176
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:30,360

3182
03:05:58,540 --> 03:05:59,540

It's car and he says Patrick we're gonna go jelly hunting. Do you want to come too?

3193
03:06:41,770 --> 03:06:46,290
You didn't hear me say I'm gonna go pee cuz we know we heard you say you were gonna go pee and then

3194
03:06:46,290 --> 03:06:48,290
It was like 20 minutes

3195
03:06:51,610 --> 03:06:53,850

03:06:54,690 --> 03:06:56,690

3201
03:07:15,860 --> 03:07:19,620

Okay, I still want to do Mario Kart. Oh

3203
03:07:24,750 --> 03:07:30,000
Wow, my microphone went up to 160 for suddenly and I got a little

3204
03:07:31,139 --> 03:07:33,139
jumpy

3205
03:07:33,340 --> 03:07:36,620
Freddy's as well, too. I'm fine with anything. I mean, I was just thinking, you know

3206
03:07:36,620 --> 03:07:41,950
I've done for Mario Kart five nights Freddy's or Taco Bell is the lobby up yet or no

3207
03:07:42,190 --> 03:07:46,590
No, hang on. Did that count as a good map or a joke awful map?

3208
03:07:46,590 --> 03:07:49,309
I would say it's more in the middle. I'd say it wasn't quite good

3209
03:07:49,870 --> 03:07:56,790
A little serious about would you guys consider that one a shit because if we do Taco Bell that is a guaranteed to be the worst

3210
03:07:56,790 --> 03:08:01,590
You ever played alright. Oh, wait, wait, wait, they lost because I went to go pee and they ran out of ammo

3211
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:07,370

3212
03:08:10,819 --> 03:08:19,040
Meet a mutant deaf and what was that sound you were just doing in my ear? Oh now you now you're quiet

3213
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:24,440
Wait, what happened? I don't know. He started making these like gum smacking sounds and like pissed me off

3214
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:31,959
Quiet when I called him gum spacking. Yeah, I was like you wouldn't you'd have to I'll probably do it again

3215
03:08:33,239 --> 03:08:40,409
Yeah, it sound like it sound like that. Who thing you did earlier cranking on out work like that gross

3216

Game cranking I don't want to be here. Where's the exit?

3220
03:09:06,579 --> 03:09:16,600
They really don't I mean, I guess I could host snow if you're trapped in the game

3221
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:23,610
Are you guys actually have to buy one of these people or else you can't leave? All right

3222
03:09:23,889 --> 03:09:30,270
Why are you hosting or should I you can just host again? It's been fine so far

3223
03:09:30,270 --> 03:09:34,190
Plus, I'm not sure if I've ever lost team. Is it up now? It is up now

3224
03:09:35,110 --> 03:09:37,989
All right, you want five minutes of Freddy's?

3225
03:09:38,510 --> 03:09:40,110
Might be shit

3226
03:09:40,110 --> 03:09:42,110
This is also a thing we have to do

3227
03:09:42,389 --> 03:09:48,819
Yeah, okay. Let's well bang them out quick. We got uh, oh, yeah, I don't see it the hell let's do

3229
03:09:53,659 --> 03:09:57,780
Which looks better than the other time we did that and then there's oh there it goes

3230
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:00,739
I want to do

3231
03:10:00,739 --> 03:10:06,940
Dude, there's a lot of extra minecraft levels. I think we wrote off minecraft too soon

3232
03:10:06,940 --> 03:10:08,940
I got like eight of those

3233
03:10:10,579 --> 03:10:14,260
The beginning because people weren't ready, but there's a lot of minecraft in there

3234
03:10:14,899 --> 03:10:18,649
There's also Simpsons. There's saw still

3235
03:10:19,370 --> 03:10:25,149
Saw is so good. They've must have fucking made a Simpsons level. There is I mean, I got it in the pack

3236
03:10:25,170 --> 03:10:32,450
Do you think I missed something? I got no I got everything but I would do almost every page of the fucking

3237
03:10:32,450 --> 03:10:35,850
I believe it. I downloaded all of them. It took me two hours

3238
03:10:36,850 --> 03:10:41,170
Hey, I mean you can't fault me. I put effort into picking these up

3239
03:10:41,489 --> 03:10:43,489
to some extent, okay

3240
03:10:44,819 --> 03:10:51,500
Okay, saw three the final chapter. I guarantee you will be good times. I can't guarantee that

3241
03:10:51,500 --> 03:10:56,340
I don't think it's even made by the same guy who made the good level. Oh, no really shit when I snuck in

3242
03:10:57,379 --> 03:11:01,299
Trap you. Yeah, this might have been my son. No, there's there's saw one

3243
03:11:01,299 --> 03:11:06,110
There's saw two there's saw three the final chapter and then there's jigsaw. We're playing soft

3244
03:11:07,229 --> 03:11:12,350
There's a lot of chapters. They really love me. There's like 18 saw movies to be fair

3245
03:11:13,030 --> 03:11:18,469
One though, right? Yeah, you're right. You're right. Maybe you're right. It might be the you know

They're fresh that one that jigsaw was made in like 2017. So

3247
03:11:22,469 --> 03:11:24,840
Probably operating

3248
03:11:25,159 --> 03:11:32,829
There is definitely a couple of traps like my own saw sort of traps that I put in this mod pack

3249
03:11:32,950 --> 03:11:36,670
Cuz I wasn't I mean, I guess I guess they are officially traps now cuz you're the host

I can't crawl

3293
03:15:12,260 --> 03:15:14,559

03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:46,760
We got a new TV

3307
03:16:46,920 --> 03:16:48,920
Hello, we're here

3308
03:16:57,569 --> 03:17:00,250
This it means you have passed your first

3309
03:17:11,629 --> 03:17:14,709
Why does he keep doing damn it keep walking back in the room

3310
03:17:28,190 --> 03:17:30,190
Hey

3311
03:17:41,149 --> 03:17:47,590
Wait, we have to find out what the game is. This is writing the wall game. All right, the blood shirt like surely doesn't hurt you

3312
03:17:51,149 --> 03:17:53,149
Don't touch the blood don't touch the blood

3313
03:17:56,450 --> 03:17:58,770
Do you know how to hack no

3314
03:17:59,049 --> 03:18:04,620
I don't have anything come over here check it. I won't even know how to hack

3315
03:18:06,780 --> 03:18:09,899
I'm not fucking around. No, he does. I need a

3316
03:18:12,059 --> 03:18:17,780
We need to learn real quick guys, okay, maybe in that box is the secret tech. What was that?

3317
03:18:19,780 --> 03:18:26,299
Alright as soon as you start talking nobody move and let him finish his head because he gets spooked if we're moving too much

3318
03:18:26,299 --> 03:18:28,299
He's drunk. Oh

3319
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:35,639
Oh wait, I heard him again. Oh shoot this. Yeah, that's what I was just shooting it not doing anything

3320
03:18:40,780 --> 03:18:44,690
Shy guy. Oh, wait a minute. I don't move nobody move

3321
03:19:00,760 --> 03:19:05,049
Okay

3322
03:19:05,329 --> 03:19:11,280
However, this next challenge will test your ability to adapt to your surroundings

3323
03:19:11,879 --> 03:19:13,879
Literally talking to just them

3324
03:19:15,719 --> 03:19:20,799
Okay, wait, so you two got to talk to Jigsaw I didn't wait I shot I shot a bear in the fire

3325
03:19:20,799 --> 03:19:25,520
And it did something it disappeared. Did you learn how to hack? It said get used to your surroundings

3326
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:30,079
We need Jigsaw's key for this room. I'm okay with your dying if I get to live

3327
03:19:30,719 --> 03:19:32,959
There that he decided he was too lazy to write to

3328
03:19:33,799 --> 03:19:36,139
Did Jigsaw have a knee brace in the movies?

3329
03:19:37,319 --> 03:19:41,000
Yes, you see the last one we got crippled. No, I don't said

3330
03:19:41,639 --> 03:19:43,739
Okay on if you stand next to this

3331
03:19:44,799 --> 03:19:49,079
Guys, you couldn't hear Jigsaw stand next to the walkie-talkie. Yes. That's when you can hear him

3332
03:19:49,879 --> 03:19:52,569
What does he say?

3333
03:19:52,569 --> 03:19:54,569
Run past him

3334
03:19:56,770 --> 03:19:59,709
His button on the ceiling

3335
03:19:59,989 --> 03:20:05,659
He says ass if you keep running past it button on the sale asshole button on the ceiling asshole

3336
03:20:06,579 --> 03:20:09,739
Asshole mine's actually not bugging out. I can hear the whole thing

3337
03:20:10,139 --> 03:20:18,360
All right test our ability to adapt to our surroundings. I think two two of us have to go in here and die

3338
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:25,450
That doesn't seem I don't think Jigsaw. I mean, I guess he does like was this no die. So what?

3339
03:20:25,809 --> 03:20:31,930
Oh, no, no to if I get if I live get to know I'm okay with your sign if I get to live

3340
03:20:31,930 --> 03:20:33,930
It has got nothing to do with

3341
03:20:37,930 --> 03:20:39,930
His dialogue

3342
03:20:40,129 --> 03:20:44,049
Stop I can't get out of the blood. I can't get out of the blood

3343
03:20:45,329 --> 03:20:49,290
Okay, we guys we got to adapt to our surroundings. Okay

3344
03:20:49,649 --> 03:20:54,610
I'd know not to jump into the pool of blood which means I've adapted to my surroundings

3345
03:20:54,610 --> 03:20:56,610
Red is dead

3346
03:20:58,129 --> 03:21:00,750
So, what do I do now?

3347
03:21:01,590 --> 03:21:03,590
There's that door

3348
03:21:03,670 --> 03:21:09,940
Has anyone learned how to hack have we adapted to hacking no hacking over here key

3349
03:21:10,979 --> 03:21:14,500
Throw nade into box. Oh

3350
03:21:15,459 --> 03:21:27,559
Smart chat. Let's try. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. What about in here? What about in the fireplace?

3351
03:21:28,360 --> 03:21:30,360
Okay, we're gonna need a fireplace

3352
03:21:36,780 --> 03:21:40,479
You realized what I get is three

3353
03:21:45,620 --> 03:21:49,899
I mean this button surely is a thing. What happened to my arrow pointing at it?

3354
03:21:50,379 --> 03:21:55,309
There goes are we not like what if you parkour with these pillars? Yeah, I'm trying to go

3355
03:21:56,989 --> 03:21:58,190
Okay

3356
03:21:58,190 --> 03:22:00,610
I'm not sure you can

3357
03:22:00,610 --> 03:22:05,620
No, maybe not. I mean, maybe there's something you need to interact with it

3358
03:22:06,260 --> 03:22:09,059
You can't do it I'm jumping on these

3359
03:22:12,100 --> 03:22:16,219
You can definitely parkour these yeah, I mean yeah you could

3360
03:22:16,219 --> 03:22:20,139
Oh, and then you eat your box and you get in the box totally jump to this and into the box. Okay. Yeah

3361
03:22:21,020 --> 03:22:26,280
All right. You ready guys. There you go

3362
03:22:27,000 --> 03:22:29,500
You're in

3363
03:22:33,299 --> 03:22:35,299
Come on guys

3364
03:22:35,860 --> 03:22:37,459
You

3365
03:22:37,459 --> 03:22:42,139
That's you're the one that needs to die. That's what it says. I'm right. I made it it says it on the wall

3366
03:22:44,139 --> 03:22:47,149
Okay, all right now pick me up

3367
03:22:53,700 --> 03:22:55,700
Now pick me up

3368
03:22:55,700 --> 03:22:57,700
Oh

3369
03:23:04,500 --> 03:23:06,500
Every time I revive I'm gonna die from these

3370
03:23:11,180 --> 03:23:14,059
We gotta be pretty sure yeah come through I'll catch you

3371
03:23:20,430 --> 03:23:23,420
Okay, okay

Dude, I'll see you go. I'll see you on this. I'm I remind me. Oh, hold on. You know what? Let me go

3374
03:23:35,979 --> 03:23:37,950
Craigin

3375
03:23:37,950 --> 03:23:40,670
Craigin was that supposed to hit me. Oh

3376
03:23:41,790 --> 03:23:47,229
Shit, it wasn't even in the right place. All right, so that way hold on anything on the right side here

3377
03:23:47,430 --> 03:23:53,149
There's some stuff over here teddy bear. Yes. Oh wait. We just had you just had it. Oh wait

3378
03:23:53,149 --> 03:23:54,950
That's a different one. Oh

3379
03:23:54,950 --> 03:23:59,799
Dude do they have juggernaut in there? It looks like it. All right follow me

3380
03:24:02,420 --> 03:24:06,440
Help oh, I see

3381
03:24:07,260 --> 03:24:12,860
Another parkour. Okay, it's some sort of jump thing. Yeah, you fall and you gotta climb back up. Well, oh

3382
03:24:20,290 --> 03:24:22,290
It's just sliding

3383
03:24:23,450 --> 03:24:29,860
Why wait they don't move with you? Why you gotta move with it? That's awkward

3384
03:24:30,540 --> 03:24:33,739
Oh, this is this is I remember this part and saw five

3385
03:24:35,739 --> 03:24:42,760
Remember the park or platform mattress to mattress. Oh that one looks so bad

3386
03:24:42,760 --> 03:24:45,319
Is it even gonna make it back in time for me? Where am I going?

3387
03:24:45,879 --> 03:24:50,639
There's a door. There's a door. There's a door right there next to you. I can't see it, man

3388
03:24:51,159 --> 03:24:54,790
Can you just like swim to it? No, there's I mean

3389
03:24:55,489 --> 03:24:59,010
Hang on. Let me see

3390
03:24:59,049 --> 03:25:01,049
No, no, no, you cannot

3391
03:25:01,569 --> 03:25:04,530
Do it you gotta do it for real

3392
03:25:05,049 --> 03:25:11,340
What level was it that this guy made that we played before candy land land?

3393
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:16,379
Okay, maybe it gets you to jump. I mean you gotta give the guy some credit. He really covers every genre with this

3394
03:25:16,379 --> 03:25:18,739
Yeah, I think he also made the game

3395
03:25:24,219 --> 03:25:26,899
You got it you got a jump you're gonna jump from that one to that

3396
03:25:29,540 --> 03:25:34,059
This is never going to have our this is we have no we can totally do this this is

3397
03:25:38,670 --> 03:25:42,069
Hey Kraken if you go into if you go into console, can you know?

3398
03:25:44,229 --> 03:25:51,610
Can you wall run I just gonna hurt. Oh, yeah wall running. Can you walk on that? That's not a thing on this map

3399
03:25:59,940 --> 03:26:04,059
Where's the where's the other what yeah, it's like the timings off

3400
03:26:06,700 --> 03:26:08,700
I'm gonna get there if you got

3401
03:26:09,620 --> 03:26:14,020
You gotta wait. Oh hard person to completely fall before you even get on the next one or else the

3402
03:26:15,340 --> 03:26:21,139
I'm just gonna go. Oh my god. It's like buggy man. It's like

3403
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:28,260
Yeah, it's odd you press forward and sometimes it's very weird. Sometimes you get stuck and then maybe jerk off. I'm host

3404
03:26:28,260 --> 03:26:30,260
It's not that bad for me, but

3405
03:26:30,500 --> 03:26:32,500
Soon as you get through this

3406
03:26:33,059 --> 03:26:38,510
One of I've now I'm too deep in no one though. I want to know how it's next

3407
03:26:38,510 --> 03:26:40,510
I want to hear more

3408
03:26:41,389 --> 03:26:45,690
It's like you move slower than the thing moves so you have to like preemptive

3409
03:26:49,709 --> 03:26:56,149
It's you guys you got a jitter step here if you watch how I do it here it's not the bed

3410
03:26:59,329 --> 03:27:04,770
I'm showing you he's like the greatest call duty gamer I've ever seen and then where's the where's the where's the door?

3411
03:27:09,530 --> 03:27:14,200
Now I can't now it's got to reset all the way, okay, I'm gonna get it this time

3412
03:27:23,620 --> 03:27:25,620
Well, that's gonna be

3413
03:27:27,340 --> 03:27:30,049
Give it a minute. It's not gonna be back in time

3414
03:27:30,670 --> 03:27:36,840
Thanks, Kraken. I think is it is it I think it might be like client-side because it was reset for me

3415
03:27:38,260 --> 03:27:43,920
Check under the water bugs. Oh man. Yeah, I don't even think my connection is good enough to do that

3416
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:45,920
I'm running on like over 120 ping

3417
03:27:46,879 --> 03:27:49,250
So I think I just watch

3418
03:27:50,809 --> 03:27:52,649
Don't look at that

3419
03:27:52,649 --> 03:27:57,530
No, crank it if you actually next to one the tilt a key actually does open the real console

3420
03:27:58,010 --> 03:28:04,829
Recognizes no clip as a command. I don't have any cheese to not turn off my fucking flashlight again. Try typing SV cheats

3421
03:28:05,329 --> 03:28:08,319
It's not SV though. Is it?

3422
03:28:08,840 --> 03:28:10,840
Actually, it recognizes SV

3423
03:28:11,319 --> 03:28:14,959
Does the knife make you run it faster in this game? Oh

3424
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:24,360
My god, it activated the platform to all guys take out your knives take out your knives. What does that do? You write faster?

3425
03:28:24,879 --> 03:28:32,940
It's just like sir. You can keep up with it. Sorry James. I'm cutting you fucking cut me. I just cut you

3426
03:28:33,299 --> 03:28:37,540
Ha I did I can do this. You're almost there. Oh

3427
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:44,440
Hey tomato, what happened to you? I died the poison she drowned

3428
03:28:45,219 --> 03:28:50,360
Yeah, the knife definitely makes it easier. All right, go for it

3429
03:28:50,639 --> 03:28:52,000
You got it

3430
03:28:52,000 --> 03:29:01,079
No, I think it's I think sometimes just get lucky in the platform doesn't fuck you. I'm mine still sitting there. Yeah

3431
03:29:01,079 --> 03:29:02,040
Oh

3432
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:04,040
You got it. You got it

3433
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:07,920
There you go, there you go

3434
03:29:08,879 --> 03:29:10,559
What's the end goal?

3435
03:29:10,559 --> 03:29:16,280
When you reach the middle of that wall, right under the stops right under the P is the is the door

3436
03:29:16,360 --> 03:29:19,000
You got to jump at the P. Oh, okay. I see

3437
03:29:19,479 --> 03:29:22,350
All right. I might get this I see it now

3438
03:29:22,829 --> 03:29:27,420
fuck

3439
03:29:27,420 --> 03:29:30,399
Don't too early. Wait, if it's under the P

3440
03:29:30,399 --> 03:29:36,479
What's the point of that platform under the like the yellow flag? I think that might be what you need to jump to actually

3441
03:29:38,479 --> 03:29:41,559
That goes towards it. Oh, really?

3442
03:29:45,639 --> 03:29:53,360
Probably right cuz look look I'll activate it. Let me see if it does anything. Is it moving or I'm dying

3443
03:29:54,239 --> 03:29:57,799
Okay, I died. Let's got it. I died

3444
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:03,479
Nice yes, was it taking me it didn't move. Oh

3445
03:30:04,399 --> 03:30:07,540
No, I don't even know if that's do it if that's gonna do anything

3446
03:30:07,540 --> 03:30:11,459
I thought it would move and it never did or do you have to jump from there into the hey

3447
03:30:12,020 --> 03:30:16,639
Crawl crawl up to what it doesn't look like you're losing time

3448
03:30:18,159 --> 03:30:25,680
The thing's gonna come back. Come on. Come back. All right, here we go. All right, so the last one doesn't move

3449
03:30:26,959 --> 03:30:29,840
It should move I it moved when I was in the wall

3450
03:30:30,920 --> 03:30:33,319
Maybe I need to be on it for longer, but I panicked

3451
03:30:33,319 --> 03:30:38,879
Maybe it gives you a second to stand on it before it moves cuz you definitely should move broken. I

3452
03:30:40,799 --> 03:30:42,799
Love saw

3453
03:30:44,040 --> 03:30:49,909
What a jump

3454
03:30:50,670 --> 03:30:54,469
Is it in the middle for you the rest of this is the rest of the

3455
03:31:04,450 --> 03:31:09,649
All right, you're there look it moves look it is moving right now. Why why is it you know?

3456
03:31:10,129 --> 03:31:15,450
God, who started it? I shot it what I shot it. I shot it. Oh

3457
03:31:16,049 --> 03:31:19,809
Yeah, oh, maybe someone else has to like do it the rest of the way you guys shoot it yourself

3458
03:31:19,809 --> 03:31:23,770
It's like a Mario maker level only one guy was able to do this. It was person that created it

3459
03:31:25,719 --> 03:31:28,479

03:47:14,649 --> 03:47:22,620
There may have been some developments on my side, too. I know what developments happened kind of

3611
03:47:24,389 --> 03:47:27,590
Sideway eyes. I haven't played on the server

3612
03:47:27,590 --> 03:47:32,190
It says the lobbies not joinable what

3613

3615
03:47:47,899 --> 03:47:49,459

03:47:49,459 --> 03:47:51,829
Are you interested? Oh

3617
03:47:51,870 --> 03:47:53,309

3618
03:47:53,309 --> 03:47:55,309
Okay

3619
03:47:55,870 --> 03:48:03,280
Conversation and I was about as quick as we got rejected inviting people to this stream. Yeah, really? That's what you should have said

3620
03:48:03,280 --> 03:48:05,280
You're like, yeah

3621
03:48:05,479 --> 03:48:09,959
Hey, you want to do this zombies thing and probably not not really

3622
03:48:12,719 --> 03:48:19,159
James can you still not get in it won't let me where let me check. Let me go off the message on steam

3623
03:48:19,479 --> 03:48:24,280
Yeah, try that cuz uh now there are enough people in that's something weird going on

3624
03:48:25,280 --> 03:48:33,389
I just clicked it. It's not that I don't think it would be fun. You just don't like us. I get it

3625
03:48:37,000 --> 03:48:41,920
Yeah, I mean like this is the first thing you've done with us I'm like fucking I know I wouldn't blame after this

3626
03:48:43,840 --> 03:48:47,920
What you guys just talking about how you guys are getting like banned from the server you want me to jump in on

3627
03:48:48,680 --> 03:48:55,260
No, there's no drama with the admins. All right, we we know the admins. Okay. Look, we're cool with them

3628
03:48:55,299 --> 03:48:59,540
It's this is more of a it's a beef. All right their gang vs our gang

3629
03:48:59,819 --> 03:49:05,540
Dude, I did something pretty questionable last night that I that chat was my chat was telling me that I could surely get banned for

3630
03:49:05,540 --> 03:49:07,659
Okay, I'm not gonna speak for James. I don't know

3631
03:49:09,940 --> 03:49:14,700
No, but I figured it out later like someone else on the server said it was like it was all cool. I

3632
03:49:16,520 --> 03:49:20,440
Used information that I got from role-playing and I did something dirty. Oh

3633
03:49:22,120 --> 03:49:24,040
But it was from role-playing

3634
03:49:24,040 --> 03:49:26,079
Okay

3635
03:49:26,120 --> 03:49:30,299
Everything my character does is dear. It's great. I'm gonna have to host since James can't join my game

3636
03:49:31,239 --> 03:49:37,719
I'm trying to accept your invite. It's just keep saying can't join try it try joining like off of yeah

3637
03:49:37,719 --> 03:49:40,120
I go put me or join. I think that's how I did it

3638
03:49:40,760 --> 03:49:48,649
Well, I'll be not joinable. What the fuck is it there try it again. There is everywhere errors

3639
03:49:49,610 --> 03:49:56,520
Maybe I mean cracking as long as we know that map like appears or something for you that you know

3640
03:49:56,840 --> 03:49:59,000
It's labeled as Game of Thrones on the map list

3641
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:03,280
Well, I'm sure that I'm not gonna be able to find it in my own lobby for some reason. It's still not working

3642
03:50:03,280 --> 03:50:04,879
I'm gonna host again

3643
03:50:04,879 --> 03:50:07,440
Yeah, let's see if you can find it. It's like all caps Game of Thrones

3644
03:50:09,719 --> 03:50:17,059
Chad am I blind or is versus thing you subscribe to everything like that. I sent you most recently

3645
03:50:17,059 --> 03:50:20,420
I think so, but I have most of it there that one was pretty

3646
03:50:20,700 --> 03:50:23,780
That one might have been one of the last ones on that list in the collection

3647
03:50:23,780 --> 03:50:26,950
I might have had the same issue as some of people were my

3648
03:50:27,709 --> 03:50:29,350
There is it

3649
03:50:29,350 --> 03:50:34,610
Okay, I was about GT RP. It's just a bunch of cringy dudes. That's the point man. Oh, dude

3650
03:50:35,010 --> 03:50:38,670
They got my number we can all be cringy together. That's right

3651
03:50:38,909 --> 03:50:45,670
We're just as cringy in the server as we are IRL cringy

3652
03:50:54,079 --> 03:50:56,760
There we go it worked

3653
03:50:56,799 --> 03:51:04,729
I'm gonna make that problem James. What's your problem with me steam filters only true friends tomato. What the fuck? All right, let's go

3654
03:51:06,190 --> 03:51:09,129
I'm sorry. Are you guys ready for us?

3655
03:51:09,170 --> 03:51:13,870
By the way, it says this game thrown spoilers if you've never seen the show don't watch the spoilers

3656
03:51:15,209 --> 03:51:17,690
You know, I actually don't know how many spoilers this might have

3657
03:51:18,409 --> 03:51:23,309
Pretty good warning if you've seen the first episode you you should probably be good

3658
03:51:23,870 --> 03:51:26,270
Yeah, watch just come here all of a sudden

3659
03:51:28,600 --> 03:51:34,540
Chad told me to turn on dev mode so I can use cheats and that may have broken some of these maps because I did

3660
03:51:34,540 --> 03:51:40,500
You like yours. Why do you listen? Are you cheating? I do even know how to undo that. No breaking stuff. Oh

3661
03:51:41,059 --> 03:51:43,059
Wow

3662
03:51:44,620 --> 03:51:49,020
White walkers what the go back to castle black

3663
03:51:53,180 --> 03:51:55,180
Enable copyright sounds

3664
03:51:56,020 --> 03:52:01,620
Fuck you, Chad. What fucking you completely broke your own game. Yes, I hear a song

3665
03:52:06,809 --> 03:52:12,010
All right, I can't actually leave I can barely hear it. All right. I'm sorry. I'm crashing. That's not the song

3666
03:52:16,450 --> 03:52:20,989
Because I was not playable why did you open a thing called

3667
03:52:21,989 --> 03:52:23,989
Online

3668
03:52:24,229 --> 03:52:28,469
His chat was like that's how you can know clear friend. They teach you

3669
03:52:29,750 --> 03:52:35,229
All right. Sorry guys, I'm chat bad a moat only mode for the next five minutes and I'm playing an ad

3670
03:52:40,709 --> 03:52:45,110
That map didn't actually look that bad though, did you see that wall? Yeah, I like the voice acting

3671
03:52:45,110 --> 03:52:50,229
I like the voice acting in the wall. They couldn't put the elevator in so they just made it stairs, which is okay

3672
03:52:50,270 --> 03:52:51,750
I guess

3673
03:52:51,750 --> 03:52:55,700
Dev mode

3674
03:52:55,700 --> 03:53:01,379
Mods enable a mode only mode. I don't watch out for you. I don't know how watch out for my mic

3675
03:53:01,379 --> 03:53:03,379
Why should I watch out for my watch out?

3676
03:53:05,260 --> 03:53:08,420
Loud loud loud

3677
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:15,020
Screamer how come well, I've been talking to screamer yet. That's kind of unfortunate

3678
03:53:15,059 --> 03:53:19,020
Yeah, I want to either screen or tits and I got neither

3679
03:53:19,059 --> 03:53:24,799
I can find tits and put them in this mod pack. You guys really want that I could look like right now

3680
03:53:26,940 --> 03:53:30,459
Hey, it's too quiet. Yeah, now you went too quiet. I

3681
03:53:31,059 --> 03:53:35,579
Want to get man, I can take all your accounts out right now if you want to slip it in

3682
03:53:35,700 --> 03:53:39,579
Do you guys want me to I can't it's a part of a video game. It's fine

3683
03:53:40,180 --> 03:53:47,510
Wait, did I ever tell you guys about my my my like my porn challenge idea? What what is a challenge?

3684
03:53:47,510 --> 03:53:49,069
Oh, does that mean?

3685
03:53:49,110 --> 03:53:51,110
Okay, all right hear me out

3686
03:53:52,350 --> 03:53:54,350
You know how you can have multiple

3687
03:53:55,909 --> 03:53:58,270
Screens like, you know, everyone's got multiple monitors, right?

3688
03:53:58,870 --> 03:54:07,879
so the idea is we're gonna stream with display capture and one of the monitors that it's off-screen is me playing porn the

3689
03:54:07,879 --> 03:54:09,879
entire stream and

3690
03:54:10,079 --> 03:54:14,379
You just have to ignore it and have it muted and like

3691
03:54:14,760 --> 03:54:18,040
It's just gonna be on the whole time and everyone's gonna know it's there

3692
03:54:18,040 --> 03:54:20,440
But as long as it's not on-screen, you can't get in trouble for it, right?

3693
03:54:23,639 --> 03:54:26,680
Fucking stuff glitches out first or something and fucking me

3694
03:54:26,680 --> 03:54:32,600
It's just like top and just like this this mental game of like watching chat and on the other side of the monitor

3695
03:54:32,600 --> 03:54:34,200
We take your heart. Oh, no, we did

3696
03:54:34,200 --> 03:54:40,000
I remember we also established the rule that you had to be you had to have a source open for desktop capture on the

3697
03:54:40,040 --> 03:54:42,040
Desktop next to it. Yeah

3698
03:54:42,879 --> 03:54:47,389
Jason desktop has to have capture. It's playing a

3699
03:54:47,909 --> 03:54:50,409
dance with death

3700
03:54:50,489 --> 03:54:54,530
The only way I know how to feel alive anymore. Exactly. All right, how are we?

3701
03:54:55,049 --> 03:55:01,370
Are we ready to I'd like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're just I mean I should I should porn on stream before I got an infraction

3702
03:55:01,370 --> 03:55:03,729
And that's it. I didn't get banned. Yes

3703
03:55:04,489 --> 03:55:06,489
porn on stream before I

3704
03:55:06,489 --> 03:55:10,370
Remember this stretch when you were streaming where it seemed like you had infraction the other day

3705
03:55:10,450 --> 03:55:13,729
Yeah, I think that was that was during that time. Yes

3706
03:55:13,729 --> 03:55:18,209
It was like a there was like this stretch where you're always like on an infraction or the context to it

3707
03:55:18,209 --> 03:55:21,329
Or just like this was a nice porn clip. I saw it wants to watch it

3708
03:55:22,090 --> 03:55:24,170
You know that fucking super seducer game

3709
03:55:24,170 --> 03:55:25,209
They had yeah

3710
03:55:25,209 --> 03:55:30,569
Like like a link in it like when you're dating one of the chicks and she said so it was like a I thought

3711
03:55:30,569 --> 03:55:34,409
It was like a fake website or something. Oh, no, and I and I pulled it up and it was real

3712
03:55:45,969 --> 03:55:47,969
That was probably the first one ever

3713
03:55:49,090 --> 03:55:54,090
I mean, there's no way that wasn't taken by that dates back to like 1996

3714
03:55:54,329 --> 03:56:00,409
That's an old one. I got a slap on the wrist for it. All right, you guys can release the mode only mode

3715
03:56:00,409 --> 03:56:04,989
Sorry, everybody. You had to be taught a lesson. All right, you guys ever do that to your chats

3716
03:56:04,989 --> 03:56:06,989
You're teaching a lesson slap around a little

3717
03:56:07,209 --> 03:56:13,329
No, I've never actually heard of my chat. My chat's usually okay. Hey yours is nice cuz you're trained them

3718
03:56:13,329 --> 03:56:18,850
Well, I that's my problem. You gotta train them on their puppies. Otherwise they get I make examples

3719
03:56:19,729 --> 03:56:22,629
Wait, we're fine with in Game of Thrones finally

3720
03:56:24,149 --> 03:56:26,149
Yes

3721
03:56:26,190 --> 03:56:28,190
I'm gonna turn up my music

3722
03:56:28,430 --> 03:56:30,430

Throne you do not know

3731
03:57:02,700 --> 03:57:04,700
The walkers don't care

3732
03:57:11,690 --> 03:57:18,020
Dude I loved much a bickering without his fucking clock and gunned down like eight guys in the woods

3733
03:57:18,379 --> 03:57:20,379
Bunch of undead bastards

They're coming no matter what you do. I'm dead. I

03:57:29,219 --> 03:57:31,639
Can't read the font of any of this

3737
03:57:32,739 --> 03:57:35,110
I'm having trouble telling how much I have

3738
03:57:35,389 --> 03:57:42,149
Look at the UI on the right the game of Thrones logo. Yeah, I'm having trouble like reading into what I'm working with here. Yeah

3739
03:57:43,750 --> 03:57:50,829
Dude I just got John's fucking sword. Wait, what I do I have it when you got ice. No, that's Ned Stark

3740
03:57:51,829 --> 03:57:54,309
One claw I got a long claw long claw

3741
03:57:57,350 --> 03:57:59,350
Oh my god

3742
03:58:01,989 --> 03:58:03,989
Your guns use long claws

3743
03:58:04,750 --> 03:58:10,270
Long claws. Oh stop using your guns. It's free. It's right over here. It's free. Yeah. Oh

3744
03:58:10,909 --> 03:58:16,149
It is free randomly in this pile. Wow, I feel a sudden change in my momentum

3745
03:58:17,110 --> 03:58:19,670
Is that text to speech? Yeah. Yeah

3746
03:58:20,989 --> 03:58:23,790
All right. Well, I'm gonna start climbing the wall and by me I mean

3747
03:58:27,229 --> 03:58:29,229
Long call doesn't even do that

3748
03:58:30,469 --> 03:58:35,389
Explode them. Yeah, they like a flying. Oh, we haven't seen the big battle yet. Maybe it will

3749
03:58:40,709 --> 03:58:43,079
Hold on hold on

3750
03:58:43,840 --> 03:58:48,280
Oh, no, I think we need to start switching to using guns. Yeah

3751
03:58:48,399 --> 03:58:50,399
Oh

3752
03:58:51,200 --> 03:58:58,260
God cover me if you still man, even when you're using guns

3753
03:59:04,819 --> 03:59:09,379
Open some of the way up. Come on guys up the wall pesky crows. They look evil

3754
03:59:10,100 --> 03:59:13,459
They look evil shoot those pesky crows. They look evil

3755
03:59:14,219 --> 03:59:17,500
Come on, we gotta go going in slow bow

3756
03:59:22,329 --> 03:59:24,930
Walkers remaining 60. I've got 68 hundred

3757
03:59:25,770 --> 03:59:26,969
Bingo

3758
03:59:26,969 --> 03:59:30,370
I'm glad there's only 60 white walkers in their army

3759
03:59:30,930 --> 03:59:36,010
This we lucked out doesn't as bad as I want to say this next one's three thousand. I got it. Oh

03:59:36,850 --> 03:59:42,370
My god, big spender boys. Let's go. It's a big map of straight line walls. Oh

What's censored over there somebody naked?

3773
04:00:48,940 --> 04:00:54,319
This is like a sensor over here on how much further is this route. They just don't seem to stop coming

3774
04:00:59,340 --> 04:01:01,340
They're behind us

3775
04:01:02,059 --> 04:01:05,049
All right, we gotta watch people what's behind us because we are getting

3776

Oh, you're trouble for the super laser gun that Jon Snow used to defeat the white walk

3778
04:01:26,319 --> 04:01:35,760
Actually, I want there's a lot of money. Yeah, let's use a lot of that money to open up this six six thousand dollar door

3779
04:01:36,200 --> 04:01:39,559
Okay, so was only 8,000 on the next one

3780
04:01:41,079 --> 04:01:44,920
Dragons

3781
04:01:46,079 --> 04:01:49,469
They're gonna be the final boss 8,000 on this one. Oh

3782
04:01:52,350 --> 04:01:54,350
At least they can't get up here easily

3783
04:01:55,069 --> 04:02:00,799
There's just a hell laser. So wow, it should just blast the theme song

Right out with me

3788
04:02:56,159 --> 04:03:04,250
That's really good there's too much shit in the way they're starting to break

3789
04:03:04,250 --> 04:03:12,489
It's gonna disappear I'm sorry I'm trying

3790
04:03:43,989 --> 04:03:45,989

3794
04:04:03,579 --> 04:04:05,020
Wait, where is he?

3795
04:04:05,020 --> 04:04:06,340

04:04:32,620 --> 04:04:34,620
There's no indicator

3801
04:04:40,500 --> 04:04:42,579
Hold on hold on

3802
04:04:45,940 --> 04:04:47,620
Here

3803
04:04:47,620 --> 04:04:52,260
Stand right here. Wait, okay. See now I can see it. I wasn't there before I swear to hold the door

3804
04:04:52,260 --> 04:05:00,090
They look drowsy. I froze them. My god. This one's ten thousand. Oh my god. I got

3805
04:05:01,149 --> 04:05:03,270
There's no ammo up here. Oh

3806
04:05:05,350 --> 04:05:07,350
This might be the end of our journey

3807
04:05:08,590 --> 04:05:10,709
Make a pound

3808
04:05:10,709 --> 04:05:12,870
Make every shot count every single one of them

3809
04:05:13,670 --> 04:05:19,190
I've used all of my shots sir. No, if you both not a headshot. Don't take the shot

3810
04:05:25,879 --> 04:05:32,629
I feel a sudden change in my momentum. I just I feel like I just felt a sudden change

3811
04:05:36,149 --> 04:05:39,290
This cut is so bad

3812
04:05:45,770 --> 04:05:47,770
I'm still alive

3813
04:06:10,069 --> 04:06:15,700
This next one is 11,000. Oh my god, someone's almost got enough

3814
04:06:16,420 --> 04:06:20,860
It's me. It's me. I just need I need a couple more hits. Let's let him go

3815
04:06:24,620 --> 04:06:27,180
It's open let's move

3816
04:06:27,299 --> 04:06:30,819
Almost to the top guys. This is so my god epic. I think there's one more

3817
04:06:31,579 --> 04:06:36,120
Why are there 13 thousands? I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it

3818
04:06:36,120 --> 04:06:41,239
I think the character I think the fucking character just said ask why it's so expensive

3819
04:06:42,719 --> 04:06:48,420
I think they're breaking help help guys. Oh my god. I have 30,000 they came from

3820
04:06:51,319 --> 04:06:53,319
You were with us is what happens

3821
04:06:54,879 --> 04:06:56,879
I was holding them literally all off

3822
04:07:00,520 --> 04:07:13,590
There's too many people down here he left guys start crawling towards us they're breaking in

3823
04:07:15,709 --> 04:07:17,709
I can't crawl anymore

3824
04:07:24,799 --> 04:07:27,420
Get that one off

3825
04:07:33,059 --> 04:07:40,180
Come on James snow, you can do it they're spawning here

3826
04:07:54,360 --> 04:08:02,170
And back nice dude, we could totally yeah, we can do this we can do this

3827
04:08:03,889 --> 04:08:10,809
So shame that we're about to crash out how the white walk is still dying. They're killing each other

3828
04:08:13,420 --> 04:08:18,879
What if we just sit here and let it get to zero they're running they're running off the side of the

3829
04:08:19,879 --> 04:08:22,879
Didn't want to live anymore. Hey, no crash. That's it's pretty good

3830
04:08:25,399 --> 04:08:29,139
Alright, let's go again

3831
04:08:29,139 --> 04:08:35,229
You can actually do this one the amount of times that I try to arrest someone and then a zombie pushes me off of

3832
04:08:35,229 --> 04:08:37,229
Them like a fucking asshole

3833
04:08:37,510 --> 04:08:39,750
He's getting a little bit wild

3834
04:08:39,829 --> 04:08:48,379
We're almost there too. I think the sword I think I got too distracted carrying around the sword

3835
04:08:48,379 --> 04:08:52,860
I sacrifice not having a full extra gun to you know, shoot with

3836
04:08:53,379 --> 04:08:58,059
My chest talks to do I want to give him a minute long at this dude give them more ads. Yeah

3837
04:08:59,340 --> 04:09:01,340
They're blaming me for us losing

3838
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:12,219
Pointing fingers ain't gonna get us over that wall, you know, hold the door Khaleesi, you know

3839
04:09:15,340 --> 04:09:18,059
You need to get out to castle black

3840
04:09:23,819 --> 04:09:27,819
What should we make of this sooner my mom

3841
04:09:28,700 --> 04:09:34,709
Shoutout to Simbo for his support

3842
04:09:39,860 --> 04:09:44,889
So cinematic

3843
04:09:44,889 --> 04:09:52,360
Maybe we should let them get in here first because then they have a chance to drop the pack of punch and that thing like

3844
04:09:53,000 --> 04:09:55,000
Save my ass. That is true

3845
04:09:57,200 --> 04:10:01,170
Yeah

3846
04:10:01,729 --> 04:10:03,729
Shame shame on you

3847
04:10:05,809 --> 04:10:08,049
Well dropped a new bomb, yeah

3848
04:10:08,889 --> 04:10:13,430
Sure did. I guess I'll open the first tier unless it's like should we just wait?

3849
04:10:13,450 --> 04:10:18,450
Until we're completely like fucked can't do anything. I mean if you open it that's here. They can start spawning behind us, which is

3850
04:10:21,450 --> 04:10:25,739
My favorite part favorite part. Oh, there it is

3851
04:10:30,889 --> 04:10:32,889
I feel like none of us get quicker by

3852
04:10:34,959 --> 04:10:38,440
So wait, you can if you go down you just get right back up

3853
04:10:38,719 --> 04:10:41,959
No, it means that we can basically res each other in like a quarter of a second

3854
04:10:41,959 --> 04:10:43,959
It means I would have been able to res you

3855
04:10:44,000 --> 04:10:45,200
Okay

3856
04:10:45,200 --> 04:10:47,000
Pretty much if I had it

3857
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:48,860
Yeah, what?

3858
04:10:48,860 --> 04:10:55,280
Well, there's also uh, there's also juggernaut get the top there too. That's kind of what helped me out a little bit

3859
04:10:56,520 --> 04:11:03,000
I'm taking damn it. I'm gonna get quicker vibe. I'm gonna get it max. Am I gonna save that?

3860
04:11:03,520 --> 04:11:07,969
Did anyone even use any if you're just using melees right now?

3861
04:11:08,809 --> 04:11:12,409
No, right, but like right now that I was reminded again. Oh

3862
04:11:16,059 --> 04:11:18,489
Enough firecrackers

3863
04:11:18,809 --> 04:11:20,809
All mine

3864
04:11:21,129 --> 04:11:24,149
I feel a sudden change in my momentum

3865
04:11:29,700 --> 04:11:32,739
Can you buy it up here we didn't fit an animal that's I just see red

3866

Can someone buy the uh, I think it's somebody used can you stop blowing into your microphone

3867
04:11:47,540 --> 04:11:49,540
Stamos we on dead

04:11:53,120 --> 04:11:55,120
Shoot those pesky crows

3869
04:11:55,239 --> 04:11:57,239
I love the iron sights on this sword

3870
04:12:05,049 --> 04:12:08,889
I was waiting on someone with more money to do it, but I guess I'll have to I open

3871
04:12:15,020 --> 04:12:20,860
Well, this is what quick revive us for let me get him

3872
04:12:23,819 --> 04:12:27,799
The gods are with us. All right, let's go because everything's starting to flake us

3873
04:12:34,040 --> 04:12:46,540
Nice God's be good. Huh James? Why is your sword on fire? I don't know on fire

3874
04:12:47,059 --> 04:12:48,940
Looked like it was on fire

3875
04:12:48,940 --> 04:12:53,209

3876
04:12:54,329 --> 04:12:56,329

Ha ha ha they look drowsy. Ha ha ha hee-hee-hoo

3882
04:13:27,930 --> 04:13:30,420
Should I buy the next tier?

3883
04:13:30,780 --> 04:13:33,780
Whoa the man of war too. All right. I'm good

It's gonna be great. Okay, what happened?

3888
04:13:57,270 --> 04:14:01,989
What happened they're coming up they're coming up you can if you have you shoot the crows it goes

3889
04:14:02,829 --> 04:14:07,750
Okay, Nick. Whoa, dude Thunder gun on this level is absurd

3890
04:14:08,489 --> 04:14:10,209
I'm going by

3891
04:14:10,209 --> 04:14:16,159
It's so bad to be stuck at like the end point and like the middle point. Yeah, it really is

3892
04:14:17,079 --> 04:14:21,159
We got times to get back time to get those points in lads

3893
04:14:22,479 --> 04:14:27,520
Time to get those points in lads. I love this game

3894
04:14:32,760 --> 04:14:35,200
It's time to get those points in life

3895
04:14:43,219 --> 04:14:45,219
Sudden change in momentum

3896
04:14:46,889 --> 04:14:48,889
sudden change in my momentum

3897
04:14:50,170 --> 04:14:54,260
And swing faster Wow, who's gonna open? Are you gonna hold for a while?

3898
04:14:55,020 --> 04:14:57,020
Hold for a bit. Oh, you wanna hold it? Okay

3899
04:14:57,620 --> 04:15:02,219
Looks like it's pretty much whenever James wants to go. He's got double or make it this max ammo here

3900
04:15:04,219 --> 04:15:08,219
The gods are with us dude, that's actually so good Thunder gun to clear the lane

3901
04:15:09,940 --> 04:15:14,780
Yeah time to get those points in lads there it is again

3902
04:15:16,139 --> 04:15:21,569
We get some good yellow line are we not gonna get like, uh, oh wait, this isn't the joke

3903
04:15:21,969 --> 04:15:24,950
Yeah, we got to keep pushing up. We might be able to just reach it

3904
04:15:25,450 --> 04:15:27,090
Start buying

3905
04:15:27,090 --> 04:15:31,840
Crikey, where you going, dude? Oh, we're going up. Okay, we're almost to the end of the wave

3906
04:15:31,840 --> 04:15:34,559
We might as well start going up now. All right, who wants to do it?

3907
04:15:35,239 --> 04:15:41,319
James gets first. How much further is this route? They just don't seem to stop coming. I'm not buying any new guns

3908
04:15:41,319 --> 04:15:47,440
I had like 13,000. We should have saved to get the bigger ones. Yeah, I'll get this one

3909
04:15:48,479 --> 04:15:53,190
Come on boys. They're gonna start spawning behind us. We don't get up to this corner. I just opened the next wave

3910
04:15:53,190 --> 04:15:55,350
Oh, there you go. What is that? Oh, they're spawning

3911
04:15:55,909 --> 04:15:57,909
What is that?

3912
04:15:58,270 --> 04:16:03,989
The power-up get it for your sword. Let's just stand here. It didn't do anything to the sword. That's bad

3913
04:16:08,389 --> 04:16:13,750
What is fireworks standing like this corner, yeah, let's crouch they can shoot over me

3914
04:16:15,350 --> 04:16:17,389
We're gonna nuclear shame on you

3915
04:16:18,149 --> 04:16:23,139
Shame on you. Yeah, this is a shitty spot to can't because of those ones spot in the corner

3916
04:16:23,139 --> 04:16:27,379
You just open up this next one. I can get it here because like they all spawn

3917
04:16:28,260 --> 04:16:32,700
All right. Okay James like right behind you. There's a good the next one

3918
04:16:33,399 --> 04:16:37,079
Right behind me. Yeah, they spawn like under you. Let's not get the nice one yet

3919
04:16:37,079 --> 04:16:42,479
Let's let's hold it here for a bit for sure far. Yes farm, baby. Does anyone have a juggernaut?

3920
04:16:44,959 --> 04:16:48,739
Okay, I think it's one more door this was really good for farming I remember this

3921
04:16:49,700 --> 04:16:55,360
I tell we didn't ran out of ammo. That was problem. Yeah, I got thunder gun this time. So forget max ammo down there

3922
04:16:56,559 --> 04:17:01,879
So tell me if you see yes, I'll let him come all the way up then or you know as far up as we can

3923
04:17:02,360 --> 04:17:04,819
All right there

3924
04:17:04,819 --> 04:17:08,319
Yeah, some points for short of an infinite ammo. There you go

3925
04:17:13,299 --> 04:17:16,909
That that's pretty cheap at the pulse gun

3926
04:17:17,709 --> 04:17:21,620
Things awesome. I don't think anything in the spa. There's another power-ups down here

3927
04:17:22,379 --> 04:17:30,250
The hell was that dead gun. Yeah, it's going in the middle now

3928
04:17:33,989 --> 04:17:37,270
All right, we want to be want to stay here on a farm what I'm gonna do I

3929
04:17:37,790 --> 04:17:40,930
Think we stay here for a little bit longer because we have plenty of ammo right now

3930
04:17:41,510 --> 04:17:45,129
As long as we don't stand any further than where James is since that's what the enemies

3931
04:17:45,950 --> 04:17:50,250
We're good to like just hang out here. I can clear it if it gets too dangerous in one

3932
04:17:51,250 --> 04:17:54,000
Nobody spots behind all right

3933
04:17:54,239 --> 04:17:57,879
Besides the more money we make right now the faster we just push straight to the top. That's true

3934
04:17:57,959 --> 04:18:03,860
Somebody needs like with 13,000 and like 11,000 for the next one to think yeah

3935
04:18:06,000 --> 04:18:11,100
All there's another pack of punch they won't have a gun. Oh, let me thunder gun. Do you hear me? Yeah

3936
04:18:12,459 --> 04:18:18,219
Right. Oh god, what was that? It's lagged get it. Yeah, I got it. I'm just trying to get past the zombie

3937
04:18:19,100 --> 04:18:21,979
The Zeus cannon wag

3938
04:18:22,459 --> 04:18:25,200
That shit's strong. Oh it is

3939
04:18:25,840 --> 04:18:27,840
Yeah, I can like clear the entire road with this

3940
04:18:29,239 --> 04:18:39,840
There's still bum rushing through. Oh shit. Nothing is insane. Yeah cold like double the ammo, too

3941
04:18:42,079 --> 04:18:49,270
I'm running low on ammo. By the way, you still have your sword. Nope. Oh

3942
04:18:50,510 --> 04:18:54,590
The sword actually works pretty well. That's a good if you don't have a mo thing. It's great

3943
04:18:55,030 --> 04:18:58,540
Wish I kept mine. Oh, I don't miss mine

3944
04:18:59,659 --> 04:19:05,879
Don't expect me to like something's getting you out of shit

3945
04:19:09,340 --> 04:19:11,340
I'm gonna buy the next thing

3946
04:19:11,620 --> 04:19:13,340
Yeah, we you know

3947
04:19:13,340 --> 04:19:15,260
any damn old school

3948
04:19:15,260 --> 04:19:20,850
Might down on the ground. What the fuck? Yeah, watch these. Oh god. They're spawning right there

3949
04:19:21,649 --> 04:19:23,170
Jerker dog

3950
04:19:23,170 --> 04:19:27,219
Yeah, get this. Let's cover here. They're up here. They're up here. Oh

3951
04:19:29,909 --> 04:19:31,909
God, oh god

3952
04:19:33,870 --> 04:19:41,110
Oh boy, the gods. Oh, thank god. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Yep. Follow James. Once you get a juggernaut front

3953
04:19:41,110 --> 04:19:45,829
I gotta get my juggernaut. Come on. I cleared it out. All right, I can't go get the juggernaut

3954
04:19:46,870 --> 04:19:49,510
10,000. I'll die. I'll die. I'll get it

3955
04:19:50,190 --> 04:19:54,030
God, I'm glad I still have it for this thing

3956
04:19:54,629 --> 04:19:59,680
We're gonna do it. Keep going up. I can't get it money. Keep going up buddy. Go

3957
04:20:00,340 --> 04:20:04,899
All right, we wait here. We camp here. Yep 11,000

3958
04:20:06,790 --> 04:20:10,549
I'm gonna save all my closest one to get to it. There's a gun here, too

3959
04:20:10,549 --> 04:20:12,549
So if we absolutely need it just so we can buy

3960
04:20:13,229 --> 04:20:17,590
I'm putting my thunder gun away for a bit to make some cash. Yes

3961
04:20:18,350 --> 04:20:23,079
James tell me if you're getting really low on health. Okay. Yes

3962
04:20:23,799 --> 04:20:29,219
Yeah, they're not going to fall. There you go. I'm infinite ammo. I'm gonna go now, baby

3963
04:20:32,540 --> 04:20:34,540
All right, save your

3964
04:20:35,260 --> 04:20:47,959
Yes, I could get the juggernaut I'm going for it I'm going to protect me I'm gonna get by

3965
04:20:50,120 --> 04:20:52,120
It's okay, I'll come with

3966
04:20:54,219 --> 04:20:58,979
You got insta kill so you should be all right if it was over if it ever was over. Yep

3967
04:21:01,159 --> 04:21:02,719
Beautiful. Thank you

3968
04:21:02,719 --> 04:21:09,340
That's up. You guys are standing a little bit ahead of the spawn point. Yeah

3969
04:21:09,340 --> 04:21:22,620
I still don't know what the fuck fireworks even does for my sword

3970
04:21:23,299 --> 04:21:34,180
I wonder what so where's the end is the next two more after this or what?

3971
04:21:34,180 --> 04:21:37,299
It's got to be a cut. It's got to be like pretty much where we were. I think

3972
04:21:40,379 --> 04:21:43,819
Push for it time to get those points in lads

3973
04:21:45,459 --> 04:21:49,860
Let's get those points in lads those points in lads I

3974
04:21:51,180 --> 04:21:54,579
Have like 15 runs left. So we're going through pretty quick right now

04:21:56,340 --> 04:21:58,899

You gonna need to get juggernaut again now. Oh, fuck me. I do I'm so bad. I'm going for it. No, yeah

3982
04:22:28,729 --> 04:22:32,049
I got 12 rounds left. This isn't a lot considering how many I had when we started

3983
04:22:33,569 --> 04:22:39,489
Walking away, we should go up an axe and we're going to fall short of ammo. We got it. Well, let's get you

3984
04:22:46,690 --> 04:22:48,610
All right, it's everyone good on chugging dog

3985

What's happening this sword is taking a lot what's going on

3986
04:22:58,930 --> 04:23:01,360
All right

3987

04:23:54,000 --> 04:24:01,079
You guys like it pretty though we should get we should get a crawler out of this out of the 56 left. Yeah

3999
04:24:16,200 --> 04:24:18,200

04:24:18,680 --> 04:24:24,280
I don't know a man in us and said basically fuck you guys as you went down the elevator kill the dragon

4001
04:24:25,000 --> 04:24:26,600

Kill the dragon. It is flying pretty close to us right now

4003
04:24:32,760 --> 04:24:37,620
All right, we're at like 39 left we should start trying to make a crawler, okay

4004
04:24:38,540 --> 04:24:45,659
Are they still down here? I don't have any more nades. Well for so what what the fuck what just happened?

I'm gonna make a crawler out of one of these white walkers

4008
04:25:05,409 --> 04:25:07,409
What an unexplainable encounter

4009
04:25:08,090 --> 04:25:10,889
Is there any? Oh, there's a max ammo over here a

4010
04:25:11,690 --> 04:25:17,129
Free one to manage. I wouldn't take it yet. Actually actually i'm pretty low on zeus cannon. We might as well

4011
04:25:17,129 --> 04:25:19,850
That's yeah, that's why I figured you get it. What the fuck just happened now

4012
04:25:21,290 --> 04:25:23,290
Coming

4013
04:25:27,290 --> 04:25:31,129
Wait laser beams, how do we get through this? I think we have to fight the dragon

4014
04:25:32,090 --> 04:25:34,090
Oh

4015
04:25:47,260 --> 04:25:49,260
Fire

4016
04:25:51,100 --> 04:25:56,219
Oh there we're locked in here don't take that max ammo yet. I'm not it's like a sequence

4017
04:25:58,059 --> 04:26:01,899
Watch out craig it behind you don't kill all those zombies gonna start the next wave

4018
04:26:02,139 --> 04:26:04,139
No

4019
04:26:14,780 --> 04:26:16,780
The seven more

4020
04:26:26,489 --> 04:26:30,569
Now at least we have to go is that seven one two three four, but that's like 30

4021
04:26:30,569 --> 04:26:35,049
I don't have to pay my hbo subscription. I know how it ends. We already know no

4022
04:26:36,409 --> 04:26:39,290
That's not seven

4023
04:26:39,290 --> 04:26:41,129
I'm this is i'm

4024
04:26:41,129 --> 04:26:44,170
I'm a little bit disappointed that we didn't manage to do a single damage on the dragon

4025
04:26:44,170 --> 04:26:48,170
We didn't do one damage on him. We did one damage. I don't see anything on his bar

4026
04:26:48,170 --> 04:26:51,850
It looks like we didn't do any damage. It's all right. We'll be okay james

4027
04:26:51,850 --> 04:26:56,170
You could probably res me if you ran over to me fast. I think they're flying. They are so fast

4028
04:26:56,729 --> 04:27:03,370
This is i believe in you because you're you're faster james take out those six there's only six what's the problem

4029
04:27:05,209 --> 04:27:07,209
There's only six left james

4030
04:27:07,530 --> 04:27:09,690
Yeah, there's only six left dude. There's only five now

4031
04:27:10,649 --> 04:27:13,690
Fucking get them more on top. They just spawn on top. Okay

4032
04:27:14,809 --> 04:27:15,930
Why

4033
04:27:15,930 --> 04:27:20,090
Why'd you tell me to do that? I'm sorry james. I guess i'll leave now

4034
04:27:22,889 --> 04:27:25,379
Let me get up right there after that

4035
04:27:26,860 --> 04:27:28,059
Hey, I mean

4036
04:27:28,059 --> 04:27:34,059
They made a level about game of thrones. That was pretty good. I mean the dragon trick custom drag model got a hand

4037
04:27:34,860 --> 04:27:36,860
Yeah

4038
04:27:37,500 --> 04:27:39,500
Like that

4039
04:27:39,819 --> 04:27:43,100
Did you hear that at the end? Yeah, it's been

4040
04:27:44,860 --> 04:27:48,459
Oh, I thought that was one of you guys. No, that wasn't us. That was the map

4041
04:27:48,700 --> 04:27:52,139
No, that was a good map that that wasn't just like t-posing bowser in the corner

4042
04:27:53,100 --> 04:27:56,379
Speaking of t-posing bowser, let's do five nights at freddy's next god

4043
04:27:57,979 --> 04:28:00,860
That's a jump. That's a jump scare one. Yeah, let's do that. Oh, hell. Yeah

4044
04:28:01,579 --> 04:28:05,989
This one actually have jumped to jump schism

4045
04:28:07,350 --> 04:28:10,170
This is gonna be a scary one

4046
04:28:10,170 --> 04:28:12,170
It might be scary warning you

4047
04:28:23,059 --> 04:28:29,459
By the killer s be the killer gonna put a face game off of this one. Yeah, that's right. You should that's true

4048
04:28:30,409 --> 04:28:32,409
Yeah, let me get it on

4049
04:28:34,950 --> 04:28:51,770
Not for me guys, you know, I don't have i haven't done a face reveal yet. Someone's got a lot of graphics. It's uh

4050
04:28:52,969 --> 04:28:54,969
We didn't ask smile

4051
04:28:55,690 --> 04:28:56,809
Okay

4052
04:28:56,809 --> 04:29:02,489
This one's loading in a lot of uh, yeah vertices what happened polygons. He's got a lot going on

4053
04:29:03,610 --> 04:29:05,690
Well, yeah charging out. I got kicked out

4054
04:29:06,170 --> 04:29:09,770
You got kicked. I got kicked out. Did you not install this one?

4055
04:29:10,870 --> 04:29:12,870
I installed the pack. I mean

4056
04:29:14,780 --> 04:29:19,420
Was it in the pack? It should be in the pack, right back. All right. Oh, it's in the pack

4057
04:29:20,299 --> 04:29:23,690
What the heck happened?

4058
04:29:23,690 --> 04:29:27,209
It still says i'm in your game too. It's still loading for me

4059
04:29:27,290 --> 04:29:32,170
I'm not sure how much the dev of this map possibly put in that it should still be loading for me

4060
04:29:35,079 --> 04:29:37,079
Hmm. Yeah, i'm wondering that too

4061
04:29:37,319 --> 04:29:42,440
How much lore did they jam pack into this? Well, do you think the reason there's no ratings?

4062
04:29:43,239 --> 04:29:47,319
Is because it's shit. Well, I knew that is there another five. Yeah, so I warned you

4063
04:29:48,520 --> 04:29:54,280
I didn't know was in my solo list. Yeah, my solo list. That means I have it, right? Yeah should be

4064
04:29:54,760 --> 04:29:56,760
Okay. Well, then yeah, I have it

4065
04:29:56,760 --> 04:30:02,600
Hang on while this is loading because it's obviously still loading the game. I'm gonna take a trip to the actual page. Yeah

4066
04:30:04,010 --> 04:30:06,010
Take a five gander nights

4067
04:30:06,489 --> 04:30:08,219
five nights

4068
04:30:08,219 --> 04:30:10,219
at freddy's zombies

4069
04:30:10,680 --> 04:30:14,760

4075
04:30:41,719 --> 04:30:45,319
Just if I can get into it if I can if it even works. Yeah, I can do that

Didn't work. I don't get why we're not friends. What did I do? What about five nights at freddy's man?

4106
04:32:40,329 --> 04:32:42,969
We're just not compatible too a good one

4107
04:32:43,530 --> 04:32:46,979
Which one was that one five minutes freddy's five?

4108
04:32:47,219 --> 04:32:53,000
Cry again, no, it was the one with all of them dude the one with all of them. I was all of them. God damn it

4109
04:32:53,559 --> 04:32:56,280
Yeah, there's like an ultimate five nights at freddy's that has all of them

4110
04:32:57,000 --> 04:33:03,000
I guess we'll just join kraken again. See if this time. Yeah, again. I'm gonna fix my mic

04:33:05,080 --> 04:33:07,080
Press join game see if we get it

4112
04:33:07,319 --> 04:33:16,889
I love it when my mic gets all quiet and everyone's like ready to go, you know

4113
04:33:18,599 --> 04:33:20,599
Lobby is not joinable. What are you?

4114
04:33:20,759 --> 04:33:22,759
Is not joinable

4115
04:33:24,520 --> 04:33:27,340
All right, guys, come on come on

4116
04:33:32,970 --> 04:33:34,970
All right

4117
04:33:35,049 --> 04:33:36,250
now

4118
04:33:36,250 --> 04:33:39,290
It's time to spend five nights at freddy's

4119
04:33:40,169 --> 04:33:44,250
Be careful to get scared. Give it five minutes at freddy's and then we're switching to monopoly

4120
04:33:44,650 --> 04:33:49,049
Oh, you guys are gonna be really excited about this one what I saw it looks like a good one

4121
04:33:49,610 --> 04:33:52,250
You know, I thought it was called friday nights at freddy's for about

4122
04:33:53,130 --> 04:33:54,330
Two years

4123
04:33:54,330 --> 04:33:59,610
What friday nights at freddy's? Yeah, I mean that was like friday fridays friday is pizza night

4124
04:33:59,689 --> 04:34:01,689
I was like, yeah, it's a pizza place

4125
04:34:02,009 --> 04:34:04,009
I mean that but that wouldn't be wrong

4126
04:34:04,409 --> 04:34:07,209
Right. Yeah, I mean you spend what a week there

4127
04:34:07,689 --> 04:34:11,049
You'd spend at least one of those days one of them is friday at least one of them is friday

4128
04:34:11,130 --> 04:34:16,810
Probably unless you start on a on saturday sunday in which case you'd probably get off right before that's true

4129
04:34:17,770 --> 04:34:19,770
You somehow skip the friday

4130
04:34:19,930 --> 04:34:21,930
You skip friday

4131
04:34:22,409 --> 04:34:28,299
I think we've reached the same spot as last time. Oh my god. I did it again

4132
04:34:28,860 --> 04:34:29,659
Yeah

4133
04:34:29,659 --> 04:34:30,619
I think

4134
04:34:30,619 --> 04:34:35,500
The only way that we make this work is that james hosts we join on james because he's the only one that's confirmed

4135
04:34:35,740 --> 04:34:37,740
Had a usable map version of this

4136
04:34:38,459 --> 04:34:42,299
How the fuck tricky tricky tricky stuff. Is there anything I need to change?

4137
04:34:42,459 --> 04:34:47,099
Uh under the private but kraken does need to kraken needs to release us like yeah

4138
04:34:47,099 --> 04:34:51,020
Like spirit so he has to close his game to release us so we don't have to restart

4139
04:34:51,259 --> 04:34:56,950
Yeah, you're you're released go go forth prosper I still have the the game up I guess

4140
04:34:57,750 --> 04:35:01,029
It'll release us in a moment. I don't know. I'm stuck forever. It's gone

4141
04:35:01,830 --> 04:35:03,830
No, trust it trust it

4142
04:35:04,150 --> 04:35:07,209
God, I hope they make more board game maps. I don't give a shit about any of this

4143
04:35:07,209 --> 04:35:10,889
I just want like not like nazi zombie yahtzee, you know, I like

4144
04:35:11,610 --> 04:35:12,729
Yahtzee

4145
04:35:12,729 --> 04:35:14,330
I want them to cover everything

4146
04:35:14,330 --> 04:35:20,810
It's like rng based where you keep rolling the dice the monopoly one does have rolling. I know that i'm almost positive

4147
04:35:21,770 --> 04:35:25,450
You you you pay like 500 bucks and it rolls the dice for you and you

4148
04:35:27,130 --> 04:35:28,810
Yahtzee zombies

4149
04:35:28,810 --> 04:35:33,689
Not that's pretty good. That's pretty good. How is it not there yet? Somebody that's perfect

4150
04:35:34,250 --> 04:35:36,650
Come on someone hop to it. Wait a minute

4151
04:35:37,450 --> 04:35:39,689
Let me look it up a friend of mine

4152
04:35:40,409 --> 04:35:45,450
Uh recently turned 24 and he said what he did for his birthday is he played yahtzee

4153
04:35:46,330 --> 04:35:50,729
That was his that was what that was his activity. That's not bad. Yeah, you know, it's a good night

4154
04:35:50,970 --> 04:35:56,490
It's a good game. It's a fun game. You just dice around and shake it up in the container. It makes the cool satisfying noise

4155
04:35:57,610 --> 04:35:59,779
Maybe you get them right maybe get them wrong

4156
04:36:04,580 --> 04:36:07,860
All right, so well it finally released me from my torment

4157
04:36:10,490 --> 04:36:12,490
It released us from

4158
04:36:16,150 --> 04:36:22,150
You want to play a game stop dude, I don't leave my mic peaked when I do the bit

4159
04:36:22,229 --> 04:36:25,029
You know, that's the thing with the bit is that I turn it down after

4160
04:36:26,939 --> 04:36:28,939
All right, james. Let's uh

4161
04:36:29,419 --> 04:36:30,779
My should be major

4162
04:36:30,779 --> 04:36:35,180
It should be up. I guess if uh, if kraken wants to join in first, I guess he could

4163
04:36:35,819 --> 04:36:40,299
No, I think i'll join in because i'm your friend on steam and i'm done. Holy shit. It worked. Look at that

4164
04:36:40,619 --> 04:36:44,860
I'm finished with you saying that we're not friends. Are we get in are we are we good?

4165
04:36:46,380 --> 04:36:48,380
Do you have james on no, I don't have

4166
04:36:48,380 --> 04:36:50,380
The guy

4167
04:36:50,619 --> 04:36:52,939
Okay, I have like two people on steam

4168
04:36:54,220 --> 04:36:56,119
the rest is like

4169
04:36:56,119 --> 04:36:58,119
7 000 notifications from when he's

4170
04:37:05,220 --> 04:37:09,220
Turning it down too low like you should remember what it's at. No, it's it's automatic

4171
04:37:09,459 --> 04:37:13,700
First it goes full volume and then it goes to 60 and I turn it back up to 90

4172
04:37:13,779 --> 04:37:15,779
I'm joining off you kraken. Hopefully you're in there

4173
04:37:16,680 --> 04:37:18,869
Oh, he's in

4174
04:37:18,869 --> 04:37:22,709
Dude, let's play this five nights at freddy's five nights seven

4175
04:37:23,349 --> 04:37:24,389
six

4176
04:37:24,389 --> 04:37:25,349
five

4177
04:37:25,349 --> 04:37:34,360
Four how the fuck does that make any sense that it would have to be me as host to fucking get it to load up

4178
04:37:34,439 --> 04:37:35,319
I don't know all we well

4179
04:37:35,319 --> 04:37:39,400
I mean all I know is that you're the only person of the four of us that loaded the map and got in it

4180
04:37:39,400 --> 04:37:43,880
You know, okay. Wait, how many of us here has done a five nights at freddy's video razor? I have

4181
04:37:44,840 --> 04:37:49,959
I I have was this was this a trap? I put my hand back down. I technically I technically didn't

4182
04:37:50,840 --> 04:37:55,639
You technically did I did not i'm the only one I am the only one that this is a new experience for me

4183
04:37:55,639 --> 04:37:59,400
I didn't make it. Well, I mean i've seen the game and i've played it on a video. Okay

4184
04:38:00,759 --> 04:38:03,319
I I had connections back when five nights at freddy's came out

4185
04:38:03,319 --> 04:38:06,599
I got like early access to the second game and the third game. Oh shit

4186
04:38:06,599 --> 04:38:09,799
You know that guy the guy that made it. I didn't know the guy that made it

4187
04:38:09,799 --> 04:38:13,080
But I knew a guy that knew the guy that made it. So they said luke am I in or crash?

4188
04:38:13,319 --> 04:38:15,880
I think it might be crashed

4189
04:38:15,880 --> 04:38:18,840
Yeah, I don't think it worked for me. I think i'm i'm probably the problem child

4190
04:38:19,799 --> 04:38:20,680
It's waiting for yeah

4191
04:38:20,680 --> 04:38:24,439
I mean, it's not letting maybe this is only a single player map because I don't remember there being four other like

4192
04:38:24,599 --> 04:38:29,560
Schmucks in five nights at freddy's it also got stuck again for me too. It just says awaiting textures

4193
04:38:29,880 --> 04:38:33,400
Maybe this isn't multiplayer. Maybe we have to settle for monopoly

4194
04:38:34,520 --> 04:38:38,520
Settle, he said but I gotta turn the webcam off. Sorry guys

4195
04:38:40,119 --> 04:38:42,119
Yeah, I mean I could

4196
04:38:43,400 --> 04:38:47,240
I did I picked some like actual good spook levels. Oh, yeah

4197
04:38:47,959 --> 04:38:53,240
Well, let's do scary like there's zombie dollhouse, which is creepy clowns and shit

4201
04:39:03,639 --> 04:39:07,479
Do I have to do I have to reboot the fucking game? Yeah, you have to release this james

4202
04:39:08,119 --> 04:39:10,599
Okay, oh alien isolation zombies

4203
04:39:11,240 --> 04:39:16,630
That was when I uninstalled because I okay sure it wasn't actually very big that map. It's pretty small

4204
04:39:16,709 --> 04:39:18,549
Is it some kind of currency thing?

4205
04:39:18,549 --> 04:39:22,709
Oh my god, I actually can't get out of this at all. What the fuck release us. I I

Okay. Now counterpoint. What about zombies and cars mario kart edition? Let's do it

I'm sorry that had to happen to you working. I had the working cars does sound pretty good sounds pretty cool

4212
04:39:54,779 --> 04:39:59,180
Yeah, that's the only reason I clicked uh, add it to collection as I saw working cars

4213
04:39:59,180 --> 04:40:04,860
I don't even think they had because in call of duty. So yes, that's an instant letter grade up no matter what game it is

4214
04:40:05,020 --> 04:40:06,700
Yeah, they they made

4215
04:40:06,700 --> 04:40:08,700

04:40:08,700 --> 04:40:10,299
quality black ops

4217
04:40:10,299 --> 04:40:11,900
That's impressive

4218
04:40:11,900 --> 04:40:15,830
I hope it works zombies and cars

4219
04:40:16,790 --> 04:40:22,229
I hope it launches dude. There's gonna be so many lol moments if you can run the zombies and with the cars

4220
04:40:22,869 --> 04:40:25,590
Oh my god, it'll be out of the yellow moments. All right

4221
04:40:26,310 --> 04:40:31,349
This is the best little little bit of education for you. All right, we call them, uh lpbs. All right

4222
04:40:31,430 --> 04:40:33,430

So you're gonna want to track your lpbs every time you do a bit

4224
04:40:37,349 --> 04:40:39,750
You're gonna want to get counter up every time you see a laugh

4225
04:40:40,389 --> 04:40:41,830
You'll know if it was a good bit or not

4226
04:40:41,830 --> 04:40:47,029
It's important to report this stuff accurately to our shareholders or else we're gonna get shot down

4227
04:40:47,830 --> 04:40:49,830
So, you know keep it

4228

The music is on for like very limited amounts of time

4255
04:42:41,540 --> 04:42:43,700
Wait, do you have to fight the zombies now? I think we have to get out

4256

04:42:51,299 --> 04:42:55,220
Wait, we need 5 000 points. No, you can't run them over you can't

4259
04:42:55,939 --> 04:42:57,939
Okay, we're like sandwich them

4260
04:42:58,419 --> 04:43:00,419
So we have to run them over

4261
04:43:00,419 --> 04:43:02,419
Why can I not run them over?

4262
04:43:02,419 --> 04:43:04,419
There's insta kill. There's an insta kill

4263
04:43:05,540 --> 04:43:07,939
We have to pay the toll. I'm down

4264
04:43:09,060 --> 04:43:11,299
How do you die with a car to protect you?

4265
04:43:12,259 --> 04:43:14,580
I wasn't in my car double points

4266
04:43:15,220 --> 04:43:17,540
Double points imagine getting out of your car

4267
04:43:18,180 --> 04:43:20,580
I got I pack a punch my car. I think

4268
04:43:21,700 --> 04:43:25,930
Is that pack a punch for everybody? I think everybody got that pack a punch

4269
04:43:26,970 --> 04:43:28,970
Kraken mother of god. What happened to you?

4270
04:43:29,610 --> 04:43:34,090
I can't get you up because I have a war machine. All right, so i'm gonna do this in here until it's gone

4271
04:43:34,490 --> 04:43:36,490

04:43:36,970 --> 04:43:42,250
Pick me up. Get me up. For the love of god ignore him. Help me. Why are you still picking me up?

4273
04:43:49,319 --> 04:43:51,319
You're all right

4274
04:43:51,740 --> 04:43:55,000
well

4275
04:43:55,000 --> 04:43:59,639
James what's up? I'm gonna need a hand. Why do we have these kind of guns?

4276
04:44:01,720 --> 04:44:07,240
James is running out the clock so he can win the race man. He's playing a win guys. I can win the race

4277
04:44:07,319 --> 04:44:11,720
How do I win the race? Well, I mean first you gotta help us because we gotta pay for the next checkpoint

4278
04:44:12,200 --> 04:44:16,919
This is gonna know me up because jim is dead. There's a lot more still spawning here

I'm gone. I died instantly when you left

4283
04:44:38,459 --> 04:44:41,099
That's what I meant was that we were both about to kill over

4284
04:44:42,060 --> 04:44:45,740
This is not even mario. You're not even a mario kart character. You gotta go behind you

4285
04:44:45,740 --> 04:44:50,409
Okay

4286
04:44:56,330 --> 04:44:59,849
Look at the png of the mario's in the audience what the fuck

4287
04:45:01,369 --> 04:45:05,369
There is a weird with this hive mind like of mario's just

4288
04:45:06,090 --> 04:45:09,290
I want to go again. I think we can do that. Let's go. Yeah, let's see if it good

4289
04:45:09,369 --> 04:45:11,369
Let's see if this crashes

4290
04:45:17,990 --> 04:45:19,990
You know easy days to do on the piano

4291
04:45:20,819 --> 04:45:23,459
How is yeah, how easy go up three keys you go down three keys

4292
04:45:24,279 --> 04:45:25,959
Go impress your friend do it

4293
04:45:25,959 --> 04:45:27,799
If I had a keyboard I could do it

4294
04:45:27,799 --> 04:45:29,159
F g h

4295
04:45:29,159 --> 04:45:31,720
Hg get a digital one use the digital keyboard

4296
04:45:33,240 --> 04:45:34,119

Okay. All right. Yeah, i'll get it right now

4298
04:45:36,119 --> 04:45:37,479

4299
04:45:37,479 --> 04:45:39,130
I'm gonna play right now

4300
04:45:39,130 --> 04:45:45,319
Okay, here we go. You have to get to watch my stream though because I can't pull through here

4301
04:45:47,590 --> 04:45:51,270
Just turn it out. Just turn it up really loud. I'll hear you. I'm gonna turn up really loud

4302
04:45:51,509 --> 04:45:54,009
I'm gonna lean into the mic

4303
04:45:54,840 --> 04:45:56,840
Can you hear it?

4304
04:46:16,540 --> 04:46:18,540
What wait, what do you mean?

4305
04:46:20,380 --> 04:46:26,540
I guess it wasn't a tune. Did you just realize it was wrong? Yeah, it's it's different the tone goes a little

4306
04:46:28,619 --> 04:46:35,110
I'm opening the game back up one elaborate one elaborate fucking bit

4307
04:46:35,590 --> 04:46:39,110
I thought I thought it was dead and dead dead. Uh, right

4308
04:46:41,830 --> 04:46:44,009
Yeah, it's a little different than that

4309
04:46:46,009 --> 04:46:48,569
Oh, oh he's lpb farming, right?

4310
04:46:50,490 --> 04:46:52,490
He's stealing our shits

4311
04:46:58,099 --> 04:47:01,700
I got too excited about all those new all those new comedy people

4312
04:47:02,659 --> 04:47:04,659
comedy people

4313
04:47:05,060 --> 04:47:08,020
Wait, why am I in your how am I in your lobby? But you're not like actually in a lot

4314
04:47:09,139 --> 04:47:14,180
Why are you in my lobby? I thought you were hosting dude. Let's turn on let's turn on black ops 3 multiplayer

4315
04:47:14,659 --> 04:47:20,500
Yeah, I got really excited really fast and then sometimes I get a little worked up it's okay. Yeah, you sir. Yeah, that's all right

4316
04:47:21,979 --> 04:47:27,180
You know, it's honestly the most jarring thing we could possibly do at this point play an actual call of duty black ops 3 zombie

4317
04:47:27,180 --> 04:47:30,299
Level and just see how fucking shit every other one die

4318
04:47:31,500 --> 04:47:33,500
Honestly, I can't even go back now at this point

4319
04:47:33,500 --> 04:47:37,659
Yeah, yeah, I never started to begin with I can't I think I can do that ever for the no

4320
04:47:38,779 --> 04:47:40,779
This is the only experience

4321
04:47:40,860 --> 04:47:42,619
it's like imagine

4322
04:47:42,619 --> 04:47:44,380
Imagine play imagine all these levels

4323
04:47:44,380 --> 04:47:51,020
But they've jam-packed about 20 000 times more needless complexity into zombies like for every actual level

4324
04:47:51,419 --> 04:47:55,659
There's like a billion different things you're supposed to do a thousand easter eggs

4325
04:47:56,139 --> 04:48:01,020
Every map is supposed to last like four months. It's insane and awful

4326
04:48:01,740 --> 04:48:03,509
honestly

4327
04:48:03,509 --> 04:48:06,630
And other people that play zombies in it. Yeah haven't some levels they just

4328
04:48:07,349 --> 04:48:09,349
They marathon lasted forever

4329
04:48:09,909 --> 04:48:14,549
They last forever and some levels might as well be like small cities at this point

4330
04:48:14,630 --> 04:48:19,189
You know one of them the what the first one in this game actually is a small city

4331
04:48:19,430 --> 04:48:25,189
You have to take a fucking bus to get to spots of it. It's like a it's like transit

4332
04:48:25,270 --> 04:48:31,319
It's like it's more chores. It's more chores than taking trams than it is playing the level. Oh my god

4333
04:48:32,549 --> 04:48:38,599
Imagine that zombies in time. Oh, we're we're doing this again. Right? Okay, I forgot

4334
04:48:39,560 --> 04:48:44,020
So someday german when you're in a conversation with someone at a party and they're like, oh I love nazis played

4335
04:48:44,500 --> 04:48:46,740
And you have to think you have to think to yourself

4336
04:48:47,139 --> 04:48:49,139
How do I answer this?

4337
04:48:49,540 --> 04:48:54,180
If you say yes, he's in mario kart version. How do you how do you relate to it?

4338
04:48:54,500 --> 04:48:58,979
You just pretend you'd be like, yeah, I could because I know about the boxes and buying and stuff

4339
04:48:59,540 --> 04:49:02,040
I'm first. I'm first. I'm first

4340
04:49:02,040 --> 04:49:04,040
No, you're not anymore boy

4341
04:49:04,439 --> 04:49:08,020
Dude, I totally screwed you over

4342
04:49:09,020 --> 04:49:10,779
Oh, this sounds awful

4343
04:49:11,479 --> 04:49:13,479
Why is my engine stuttering like this?

4344
04:49:13,720 --> 04:49:19,029
Damn, I was gonna knock you off the road, man

4345
04:49:20,340 --> 04:49:25,799
I knew there was a turn coming up. I couldn't do that forever. I love how the music's so temporary

4346
04:49:26,659 --> 04:49:28,819
What the fuck? I mean we have to make money

4347
04:49:29,779 --> 04:49:32,150
We can't even open this until we make some money

4348
04:49:33,509 --> 04:49:39,430
I've I found something. All right, everyone. Let's make some money at the beginning of the level. There's something back here

4349
04:49:40,229 --> 04:49:40,950
Oh

4350
04:49:40,950 --> 04:49:44,630
Jesus christ, why'd that zombie jump? I knew you were gonna be fine

4351
04:49:46,709 --> 04:49:50,389
I mean, we should never be caught because we can run there's so much space to run

4352
04:49:53,509 --> 04:49:58,869
Somebody just said this looks like a shitty mobile game

4353
04:50:02,709 --> 04:50:09,500
One of like the 4 000 ipad versions of this game how do we get up here? It's the kill

4354
04:50:10,299 --> 04:50:13,380
There's the music

4355
04:50:13,380 --> 04:50:15,529
And it's gone

4356
04:50:15,529 --> 04:50:17,529
Nice now, how much does this cost?

4357
04:50:19,240 --> 04:50:21,240
5000 5000. Oh

4358
04:50:22,200 --> 04:50:24,919
This is gonna be a bad race too many. Hello

4359
04:50:26,360 --> 04:50:29,560
What was that? That it looks like a pack of punch thing, but like

4360
04:50:31,400 --> 04:50:35,009
What does it actually do? Oh, it's a streaker

4361
04:50:36,770 --> 04:50:38,880
What oh

4362
04:50:38,880 --> 04:50:43,680
I'm getting real sick of my music just turning on for the first four beats and then turning off

4363
04:50:44,240 --> 04:50:46,319
That's how the member you know that myth about copyright

4364
04:50:47,520 --> 04:50:49,680
As long as you only play it for 10 seconds, you're fine

4365
04:50:50,560 --> 04:50:52,479
Oh my god

4366
04:50:52,479 --> 04:50:55,919
Nintendo's yet to find this they won't find dastardly creator

4367
04:50:58,080 --> 04:51:02,479
Is a shrieker it's it's like one of the dragons

4368
04:51:03,919 --> 04:51:08,959
Dragons, I don't know what the hell the ticking is the sound of you getting any points watch

4369
04:51:09,759 --> 04:51:12,709

4370
04:51:14,279 --> 04:51:15,880
Oh it is

4371
04:51:15,880 --> 04:51:21,560
Someone can afford to open someone can afford blue guy can do the race blue and the guy from over here actually killing stuff

4372
04:51:22,119 --> 04:51:25,880
What we were killing? Oh, you took my car german get out. So i'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

4376

Maybe if you if you move a car close enough, I can climb into it. Can't you oh, that's that a good idea

4454
04:57:30,150 --> 04:57:33,990
James I got bad news turns out you just had to pay money to open up the end of the race

05:02:49,349 --> 05:02:51,110
One came through

4532
05:02:51,110 --> 05:02:54,630
Can you clear can you make sure that place is cleared out for me so I can like run in it's clear

4533
05:02:55,029 --> 05:02:57,909
Oh, well, there's a couple that that come through but there's not

4534
05:02:58,709 --> 05:03:00,709
There are dogs behind

4535
05:03:04,389 --> 05:03:09,459
Doing like a weird what's this walk they don't even want to fight you. Yes

4536
05:03:12,889 --> 05:03:17,130
Oh, what the fuck I think you might have forgotten but there's a race that's on right now james

4537
05:03:19,590 --> 05:03:21,830
I'm right behind you. Is this beginning of the level?

4538
05:03:24,439 --> 05:03:26,569
Oh tree

4539
05:03:26,569 --> 05:03:28,099
Oh

4540
05:03:28,099 --> 05:03:30,099
Okay. Well, this level is awful. I'm gonna

4541
05:03:30,659 --> 05:03:34,900
I'm gonna vote in for taco bell the car that kreiken was just sitting there

4542
05:03:35,779 --> 05:03:38,779
What do you guys think?

4543
05:03:38,779 --> 05:03:43,360
Because I don't think with this tree here we can finish. I don't think it's possible

4544
05:03:43,919 --> 05:03:49,360
So I think you're supposed to get up here you're supposed to probably get the ramp ramp over ramp up here

4545
05:03:50,400 --> 05:03:53,950
But I mean like I did the lap technically

4546
05:03:56,080 --> 05:03:58,250
Yeah, I guess we did

4547
05:03:58,250 --> 05:04:01,529
Oh look up here. It says I fucking hate this map

4548
05:04:02,490 --> 05:04:07,290
Oh, well, that's a good enough sign for me. I think it's time to play taco bell

4549
05:04:08,009 --> 05:04:13,369
Taco bell mcdonald's or I can see the outside of the map right here. I can see give me a boost

4550
05:04:13,689 --> 05:04:17,290
Can you see underneath? Oh, you're pushing me under turn and look underneath if you can

4551
05:04:19,549 --> 05:04:21,069
Hold on. They're coming

4552
05:04:21,069 --> 05:04:26,439
I can see a better place a better

4553
05:04:28,939 --> 05:04:30,939
I want to see it so bad. Give me a boost

4554
05:04:37,790 --> 05:04:40,029
I want I think i'm gonna let him take me. I got an idea

4555
05:04:40,669 --> 05:04:46,380
Kill me james. I'm not I can't do this with you anymore. Okay, you have zombie blood. They can't see you

4556
05:04:46,459 --> 05:04:49,020
Wait, hold on. Can you guys just walk around the tree?

4557
05:04:49,819 --> 05:04:51,819
Is this

4558
05:04:52,299 --> 05:04:54,619
Go win the race tomato. That was your chance

4559
05:04:55,979 --> 05:04:57,979
He's held up

4560
05:04:57,979 --> 05:04:59,979
Goodbye james. I'm sorry

4561
05:05:01,020 --> 05:05:04,139
Wait, no, it's not it doesn't matter as much if you don't like to feel bad about me

4562
05:05:04,860 --> 05:05:06,860
I'm just trying to get out of this world

4563
05:05:09,020 --> 05:05:11,020
On a car spawn a car get a car get a car, dude

4564
05:05:12,380 --> 05:05:16,700
Oh, i'm bankrupt. I don't have any money for a car. I don't have any money that one

4565
05:05:17,180 --> 05:05:20,650
This is my old car. I left this car here. I glitched out up here

4566
05:05:21,919 --> 05:05:23,520
This is it

4567
05:05:23,520 --> 05:05:27,040
This is the one I kept this one can fly, you know, this is your chance

4568
05:05:30,880 --> 05:05:32,240
Wait

4569
05:05:32,240 --> 05:05:34,400
That's how I died. Be careful, please

4570
05:05:35,599 --> 05:05:40,319
I can see it. Oh, yeah, that that is how two people have died on this map not by the zombies

4571
05:05:41,200 --> 05:05:43,200
second lap

4572
05:05:45,119 --> 05:05:47,520
How many laps in this lap that's five

4573
05:05:48,000 --> 05:05:50,000
Va

4574
05:05:50,880 --> 05:05:52,880
No way

4575
05:05:52,959 --> 05:05:57,599
That was some pretty good pretty good driving around I need another 5 000 bucks to open the door again

4576
05:05:58,240 --> 05:06:01,439
What do you think these like parts do there's random parts on the map, too

4577
05:06:02,319 --> 05:06:06,639
I don't know what the fuck this man. I don't know how to explain this to you, but I don't think I care what they do

4578
05:06:08,400 --> 05:06:11,360
You're trying to fucking win the race. No, I want to go

4579
05:06:11,599 --> 05:06:14,560
I want kraken to close the lobby, but he keeps on telling me to race

4580
05:06:15,520 --> 05:06:21,119
There must be a winner I feel like I won. Can we go? Someone has to win

4581
05:06:22,400 --> 05:06:26,639
I can't fuck. Oh, wait quick. Look look Mario. Oh

4582
05:06:28,080 --> 05:06:30,080
Wait, i'm alive. What am I alive?

4583
05:06:31,279 --> 05:06:33,279
Why are we alive? We can win this

4584
05:06:34,799 --> 05:06:40,720
What did they just trade his life for ours? We sacrificed him to the giant mario statue

4585
05:06:41,680 --> 05:06:44,750
What the fuck now is our time

4586
05:06:45,470 --> 05:06:49,790
It's the time to shine. Oh, we're going backwards. They're going the wrong way. I'm gonna get this cold

4587
05:06:50,509 --> 05:06:52,509
Brewski and let's go

4588
05:06:55,599 --> 05:06:57,599
I think are we going the wrong way?

4589
05:06:57,840 --> 05:07:00,299
I think it's the right way

4590
05:07:00,299 --> 05:07:04,860
Oh, there's so many what the fuck. Yeah, no way you're gonna get swarmed

4591
05:07:05,500 --> 05:07:10,619
They're all treated. I just spit all over myself. Hey, I got insta kill for you guys. Oh, wait

4592
05:07:11,099 --> 05:07:13,099
Go into that corner over there

4593
05:07:13,180 --> 05:07:16,139
Yeah, yeah, go it's too many watch this

4594
05:07:20,619 --> 05:07:23,279
Investigate that corner. It's further over

4595
05:07:25,200 --> 05:07:28,720
I mean, I do want to see the mario again. Oh, I see what you're saying

4596
05:07:31,340 --> 05:07:35,979
It's well, I i've dropped through further. It's over here. It's over here. It's over here. What is another bar?

4597
05:07:37,180 --> 05:07:40,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's where there it is. This is this is the lip. This is the lip

4598
05:07:40,860 --> 05:07:43,659
Okay, where where is mario's location? All right, I

4599
05:07:44,619 --> 05:07:46,619
Is it this this way

4600
05:07:47,580 --> 05:07:51,819
Where's the center? The center is that way, right? I'm gonna start spinning around. All right, you just start

4601
05:07:52,619 --> 05:07:58,750
Just start spinning around. I'll tell you east. He's east which way which east

4602
05:07:59,069 --> 05:08:07,950
I'll put hold him think about east is it could be anybody's east. Why is that actually under there?

4603
05:08:08,799 --> 05:08:11,840
How do I capitalize on that and find him in kraken's honor?

4604
05:08:13,040 --> 05:08:15,040
It's right. I don't know where east is

4605
05:08:15,520 --> 05:08:17,520
It's on the other end of the tunnel there he is

4606
05:08:19,770 --> 05:08:21,130
um

4607
05:08:21,130 --> 05:08:27,529
What the fuck is everyone else dead? Is it just me? I don't have any money. Can we win the race? Did I win?

4608
05:08:28,090 --> 05:08:32,490
Yeah, you won. I don't really want to grind money to do this mario bit. Honestly

4609
05:08:33,130 --> 05:08:35,130
I don't think the lpb is gonna

4610
05:08:37,200 --> 05:08:40,990
What do you get that mario model? You know what I mean?

4611
05:08:42,029 --> 05:08:43,389
Yeah, gmod

4612
05:08:43,389 --> 05:08:45,389
Just gmod and you made it

4613
05:08:46,349 --> 05:08:52,080
I don't know. You can't like pull data from from like the wii u disc. Oh, yeah, you can totally convert

4614
05:08:52,569 --> 05:08:54,569
You can pull like the mario t-post from like

4615
05:08:55,369 --> 05:08:56,569
wii u

4616
05:08:56,569 --> 05:08:58,569
For sure. Oh

4617
05:08:58,650 --> 05:08:59,930
crashing

4618
05:08:59,930 --> 05:09:01,930
That means it was a good map

4619
05:09:02,090 --> 05:09:04,189
All right. How you guys feeling do I do one more?

4620
05:09:04,189 --> 05:09:07,150
I don't want to hold you guys hostage if you're all burnt out from

4621
05:09:07,790 --> 05:09:11,150
This chaos we can do another one. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good

4622
05:09:11,869 --> 05:09:16,349
All right. Well, there's zombie cat tree, which I kind of want to try and then there's uh, what happened?

4623
05:09:17,389 --> 05:09:19,389
When are we doing?

4624
05:09:21,709 --> 05:09:26,110
We heard monopoly monopoly so much fun we've never gotten past like the second wave of monopoly, but

4625
05:09:26,669 --> 05:09:29,310
I mean, this might be the crew. We might have trained enough

4626
05:09:30,189 --> 05:09:32,270
Oh, I think we've trained enough

4627
05:09:36,139 --> 05:09:38,139
I can hear him swallowing tomato

4628
05:09:38,540 --> 05:09:40,540
Dude get out of my fucking ears

4629
05:09:41,340 --> 05:09:42,860
I'm just

4630
05:09:42,860 --> 05:09:47,180
I'm just waiting that's the kind of microphone that you can hear the person's mom trying to talk to them

4631
05:09:47,659 --> 05:09:49,740
You they're in like the xbox lobby and you hear like

4632
05:09:51,180 --> 05:09:54,060
You want this or that? No, I'll take uh, yeah, I want

4633
05:09:55,180 --> 05:09:57,099
Yeah, i'll take the chicken

4634
05:09:57,099 --> 05:09:58,299
All right

4635
05:09:58,299 --> 05:10:02,220
It's not on me. You hear them like smoking you can hear them smoking fucking cigarettes

4636
05:10:04,409 --> 05:10:07,209
You guys have been able to hear that before you can you ever hear somebody else in the room?

4637
05:10:07,930 --> 05:10:11,689
Smoking cigarettes like not the person that's in the lobby the person like on their couch

4638
05:10:14,360 --> 05:10:17,400
Yeah, I swear to god like 20 feet away. Yeah, you just hear like

4639
05:10:21,919 --> 05:10:24,080
I can hear it. I swear to god. I've never had that

4640
05:10:31,229 --> 05:10:43,819
Monopoly dude, you guys haven't gotten past wave two

4641
05:10:44,459 --> 05:10:47,419
It's so hard. Wow

4642
05:10:47,419 --> 05:10:51,419
We didn't have enough. I think we're also cracking was that last time we did this

4643
05:10:51,419 --> 05:10:54,939
We only had three people and did we have more this was the first one we did last time

4644
05:10:55,840 --> 05:10:59,840
You know, how many people did we have when we did it? I think we had three. Yeah, so we were not

4645
05:10:59,840 --> 05:11:03,200
Yeah, we were short a guy. We were short a guy and we were not we had no idea what we were doing

4646
05:11:03,200 --> 05:11:08,080
So all right. Well, hey what what how about why don't we do taco bell first and and give a two minute time?

4647
05:11:08,720 --> 05:11:14,080
You want to warm up the tuck? All right, we'll start with taco bell. Let's start with a three minute time talk about kfc because

4648
05:11:14,639 --> 05:11:19,919
All right. I'll be honest. There's there's mcdonald's 1.0. There's taco bell 2.0 and kfc 3.0

4649
05:11:19,919 --> 05:11:24,959
All I can say about mcdonald's is definitely the best map, but I think taco bell has the best

4650
05:11:26,000 --> 05:11:27,040
You know

4651
05:11:27,040 --> 05:11:32,240
Presence taco bell then taco bell was the one that won the vote. Okay. All right deal

4652
05:11:33,200 --> 05:11:36,240
Yeah, we don't have to do the whole thing working drive-through. It's just so on the features

4653
05:11:36,479 --> 05:11:38,000
Look every time I have taco bell

4654
05:11:38,000 --> 05:11:38,720
I'm like

4655
05:11:38,720 --> 05:11:43,360
This is going to be the time that I enjoy taco bell and every time I get sick and I wish I didn't have taco bell

4656
05:11:44,080 --> 05:11:46,080
What are you ordering?

4657
05:11:47,770 --> 05:11:51,130
There's no way you can't enjoy it if it's completely digitalized, you know

4658
05:11:51,450 --> 05:11:54,009
What are your favorite things on the menu favorite things on the taco bell menu?

4659
05:11:54,650 --> 05:11:57,290
I don't know because i've been sick every time i've had any of those. I would say

4660
05:12:02,119 --> 05:12:06,119
Last last time we talked about this everyone got hungry which is crazy. Yeah. Yeah

4661
05:12:06,119 --> 05:12:09,400
I mean, you don't want to make me hungry because i'll leave i'll leave. I'm trying to join

You guys have a cheesy gody to crunch from taco bell. Oh, no, but I haven't but that sounds so good

4673
05:12:49,279 --> 05:12:54,959

You just said yourself though, like you fucking don't like it. I always regret it. No, don't post

4681

You gotta fucking do it real quick. Yeah, you can't post mates after 12 a.m

4683
05:13:21,709 --> 05:13:25,869
After 12 a.m, like the gremlins come out you you'll never get your water. I have totally done it

4684
05:13:27,150 --> 05:13:28,909

4712
05:15:34,520 --> 05:15:37,959
It is crazy and this cheese spread on the soft shell. I'm dead again

4713
05:15:40,700 --> 05:15:47,099
Oh my god, I forgot. We're playing a video game. I definitely take money from them to bring up this sort of shit on stream

4714
05:15:48,880 --> 05:15:55,200
Every time i'm gonna uh box that's why you think I picked this map and added it to my collection delicious

4715
05:15:56,240 --> 05:15:58,240
Okay, that's cheesy gordita taste

4716
05:15:59,200 --> 05:16:00,560
The fire sauce

4717
05:16:00,560 --> 05:16:03,680
This is there's like a there's like a fiery burning asshole joke in here

4718
05:16:03,680 --> 05:16:05,919
If you guys want to see some mellow moments, it's in there

4719
05:16:06,080 --> 05:16:11,360
I'm not allowed to talk about that because I they asked me not to I love to talk about burning assholes

4720
05:16:11,360 --> 05:16:14,479
Let's take a look. Take a look at me. It's there. Oh, that's pretty funny

4721
05:16:15,200 --> 05:16:17,200
That's all you know

4722
05:16:17,259 --> 05:16:19,259
relatable

4723
05:16:19,919 --> 05:16:25,360
Relatable if I were if I was the map maker I'd put red all over this that's gonna be you in a fucking

4724
05:16:26,080 --> 05:16:28,080
couple hours here

4725
05:16:28,959 --> 05:16:30,959
What if i'm gonna sleep by then?

4726
05:16:32,959 --> 05:16:35,520
No, that's not good. You don't want to sleep with diarrhea in your body

4727
05:16:37,599 --> 05:16:41,599
Because then you know, it's in there and you know, you gotta get it out sloshing around

4728
05:16:44,799 --> 05:16:48,720
Yeah, whatever gets us out of this whole conversation sounds pretty good get me out

05:16:58,240 --> 05:17:03,360
He's doing the speed voice guys. Everyone. Listen, it doesn't do that. It's like that's like a joke. It's like a meme

4732
05:17:04,939 --> 05:17:06,939
Oh my god

4733
05:17:06,939 --> 05:17:09,630
Well, I opened the door you guys

4734
05:17:09,709 --> 05:17:12,380
You can go outside and the taco bell if you'd like

4735
05:17:13,419 --> 05:17:15,849
Why would I want to leave?

4736
05:17:15,849 --> 05:17:18,279
Hey, I got the thunder gun

4737
05:17:18,360 --> 05:17:20,360
Oh, that thing's good

4738
05:17:20,439 --> 05:17:25,869
Okay, clear them off of me clear them off of me get them off of me

4739
05:17:27,630 --> 05:17:29,630
Hey, I don't know if that was

4740
05:17:29,790 --> 05:17:36,349
Bro, come on get me out. Hey, did you know that if you eat taco bell like did you get like fucking crabs?

4741
05:17:38,029 --> 05:17:40,029
Like that doesn't happen like

4742
05:17:40,349 --> 05:17:42,919
I mean like I

4743
05:17:42,919 --> 05:17:47,080
I don't remember many times after I had taco bell that I like was incapacitated for like

4744
05:17:47,799 --> 05:17:52,919
And did you know that it's like 75 percent fake meat a day's human meat in it, too

4745
05:17:53,930 --> 05:17:59,369
They have their menu back here. This is hostile. Wait, wait at the back of the mopping hold them up

4746
05:18:01,290 --> 05:18:03,290
No

4747
05:18:03,770 --> 05:18:05,849
You got it, that's if you can read the menu closer

4748
05:18:06,970 --> 05:18:13,369
All right. I don't think they had the gordita crunch. You guys see this like hostile advertising on the back of the fucking

4749
05:18:14,490 --> 05:18:18,009
Is there wait? Why why is this burrito crisp? I mean a massive

4750
05:18:18,569 --> 05:18:19,689
Why is it?

4751
05:18:19,689 --> 05:18:21,689
It says mcdonald's is coming soon

4752
05:18:22,169 --> 05:18:26,650
Coming soon. I mean that map exists. They got empanadas. They've empanadas at the taco bell

4753
05:18:27,369 --> 05:18:28,409
Huh?

4754
05:18:28,409 --> 05:18:29,849
You fucking serious up

4755
05:18:29,849 --> 05:18:34,569
I'll post mace it right now, too. Hi. Well, we're over our three minutes on this map guys. So it's time to wrap up

4756
05:18:34,729 --> 05:18:39,529
I'm gonna order these empanadas. I gotta I gotta order food. Hold on. Let me order the food. Are we all gonna order?

4757
05:18:40,009 --> 05:18:41,689

05:18:41,689 --> 05:18:43,689
Oh not in real life. All right, i'm actually gonna do it

4760
05:18:45,770 --> 05:18:47,770
I don't know the hell. Oh shit

4761
05:18:49,340 --> 05:18:52,860
I think did it give me this is this hey, do you guys want to see a funny meme?

4762
05:18:52,939 --> 05:18:55,900
Let me know well you you better order before the gremlins come up

4763
05:18:57,229 --> 05:18:59,549
All right. Well, here's a funny meme if you look at top left

4764
05:19:00,110 --> 05:19:02,110
It says 30 customers left

4765
05:19:03,130 --> 05:19:05,290
God damn. Oh, i'm physically looking

4766
05:19:06,560 --> 05:19:10,560
Yeah, looking instead of zombies. They're implying that the zombies are customers

4767
05:19:11,119 --> 05:19:13,119
I get it mexi fries

4768
05:19:14,159 --> 05:19:16,159
Hold on a minute. This stuff isn't even real

4769
05:19:16,959 --> 05:19:22,479
Wait, why are we still looking at the fucking menu? Yeah, I don't this is I i've been to taco bell a lot of times

4770
05:19:22,799 --> 05:19:28,000
Mexi fries mexi fries. No, those are real. I had someone talking about those earlier today in my chat. I saw it

4771
05:19:28,720 --> 05:19:31,680
Someone brought up mexi fries. They took them off of the menu. I don't know why

4772
05:19:32,319 --> 05:19:35,200
But they actually removed they executed them recently from the menu

4773
05:19:36,639 --> 05:19:42,880
I know they had they must exist because someone someone talked about them and there's no way they sell cigars

4774
05:19:44,080 --> 05:19:46,080
Look at no

4775
05:19:47,119 --> 05:19:51,680
No beef burrito. Look at that. That's a that's a nice cigar

4776
05:19:52,400 --> 05:19:54,080
Look at the bottom

4777
05:19:54,080 --> 05:19:56,080
Yeah, I see it. Oh

4778
05:19:56,560 --> 05:20:03,919
I mean, I think it's legit. I think those two exist. I'm trying to read the menu still quit beeping behind me

4779
05:20:05,520 --> 05:20:09,279
All right, we're all here at fucking two o'clock in the morning. You don't have to hold the horn down

4780
05:20:11,450 --> 05:20:16,220
50 people behind me trying to punch me all the way down underground

4781
05:20:17,549 --> 05:20:19,549
Did you guys ever understand that when people do that shit?

4782
05:20:23,740 --> 05:20:28,240
Oh, I definitely don't have time to get you it's like a thousand guys

4783
05:20:29,610 --> 05:20:32,009
Oh now I do should I get a cool ranch

4784
05:20:35,209 --> 05:20:38,889
Stop squirming. I'm not moving. I haven't even moved at all

4785
05:20:39,849 --> 05:20:45,200
Like doing this a little wiggle. Are you what the fuck happened? Oh, you're dead

4786
05:20:46,159 --> 05:20:48,159
Yeah. Oh, yeah, i'm dead

4787
05:20:49,520 --> 05:20:52,159
Taco time is taco time taco bell

4788
05:20:53,200 --> 05:20:57,040
Is that a different company? Wait, is this wait a minute? This is not even taco bell

4789
05:20:57,040 --> 05:21:00,959
Could this guy not get the actual taco bell menu? You want to get fucking serious?

4790
05:21:02,159 --> 05:21:04,159
Taco time is a different restaurant

4791
05:21:04,400 --> 05:21:10,080
They keep grabbing adjacent taco themed restaurant and put it up on his taco bell menu like map

4792
05:21:16,240 --> 05:21:18,880
We're shilling for the wrong restaurant buddy

4793
05:21:19,599 --> 05:21:22,909
Did you kill them all? Yeah. Oh, there's one customer left

4794
05:21:24,560 --> 05:21:29,680
Don't kill them. I need to go underground to explore this map. What's the fiery sauce? What is that called?

4795
05:21:30,319 --> 05:21:36,000
Fire sauce. It's not on here. It just says fire sauce hot sauce technically fire

4796
05:21:36,159 --> 05:21:40,560
How many mick chickens do you think guys could eat in one sitting if you were really hungry? I'm gonna say six. Uh, 30

4797
05:21:42,009 --> 05:21:46,250
Wait 30. Oh, I thought you meant nuggets mick chickens. Oh, yeah, I always like to get nuggets

4798
05:21:47,209 --> 05:21:49,209
Make chickens. I could probably do four or five

4799
05:21:51,389 --> 05:21:53,389
I eat a lot 30

4800
05:21:54,110 --> 05:21:56,599
I eat a lot. You'll be winning competitions

4801
05:21:58,430 --> 05:22:02,990
Ask kraken. I eat a lot. He does eat a lot. I eat I eat an abnormal amount

4802
05:22:09,599 --> 05:22:12,080
No, wait watermelon

4803
05:22:12,080 --> 05:22:15,759
Yeah, the beginning said shoot three watermelons. There's gonna be some joke here

4804
05:22:16,240 --> 05:22:18,799
Where you follow that pipe all the way to the end. It might yeah

4805
05:22:18,880 --> 05:22:24,400
It might be a joint and that's gonna pump into the restaurant as like the meat or something. You found all teddy bears

4806
05:22:25,200 --> 05:22:29,599
Yay, what does that mean? I think i'm gonna jump in this makes fun music hole

4807
05:22:29,919 --> 05:22:32,159
Oh

4808
05:22:37,229 --> 05:22:39,229
Don't go down there don't

4809
05:22:41,069 --> 05:22:47,229
This is a real band I think it's like some 41 I don't want to go to school. I just want to stay at home

4810
05:22:48,509 --> 05:22:50,509
Oh

4811
05:22:50,509 --> 05:22:55,389
Art careful last one I went in it killed me instantly

4812
05:23:00,090 --> 05:23:04,970
Man, we waited just long enough to talk there that we definitely murdered all of our vods. That's pretty cool

4813
05:23:07,930 --> 05:23:10,650
I was a good well unified silence

4814
05:23:13,720 --> 05:23:18,279
The fuck do I open this saw you land the watermelon. I need the other watermelon to open it

4815
05:23:19,580 --> 05:23:22,299
I I love this taco bell map play through

4816
05:23:23,020 --> 05:23:25,020
I wish this played in taco bell

4817
05:23:27,119 --> 05:23:29,599
No worries guys i'll find this

4818
05:23:30,880 --> 05:23:35,130
It's probably up there

4819
05:23:35,130 --> 05:23:39,369
It actually to come back to taco bell. This is this is some 41 by the way

4820
05:23:41,930 --> 05:23:44,250
Yeah, I have all their albums I just know I know so

4821
05:23:46,169 --> 05:23:47,290
No

4822
05:23:47,290 --> 05:23:49,290
I do this thing where you know how like you play

4823
05:23:49,450 --> 05:23:51,450
You get in the car and you pick up a few people and you get you know

4824
05:23:51,610 --> 05:23:53,770
You want them to hear your music that you think is good?

4825
05:23:54,729 --> 05:23:56,970
And then you but you're you you know that they're not gonna like this

4826
05:23:56,970 --> 05:24:01,049
But like maybe if you put on the best one of the album they'll listen and go

4827
05:24:01,130 --> 05:24:05,049
Oh, actually, this is pretty fucking cool. You're like, yeah, it's pretty good. I i'll put on some some 41

4828
05:24:05,529 --> 05:24:07,689
I do that to everybody and I put this song on

4829
05:24:09,529 --> 05:24:12,490
And I like I just sit there and I hope that they're gonna be like this is pretty good and I like

4830
05:24:12,650 --> 05:24:16,729
Validate myself going like yeah, it is fucking kind of good. You know that it fell off recently

4831
05:24:18,889 --> 05:24:22,729
Literally now I have like a poster of all of them separately not just the band as a whole

4832
05:24:23,049 --> 05:24:25,049
Each individual band member is on the wall

4833
05:24:30,569 --> 05:24:34,810
Why are we doing why are we I think this is symbol I think it's symbolic of the song

4834
05:24:35,450 --> 05:24:38,330
I want to be relieved. He's doing a bit with the song lyrics

4835
05:24:43,049 --> 05:24:45,049
Can we

4836
05:24:46,509 --> 05:24:49,950
Look at this little car

4837
05:24:49,950 --> 05:24:51,950

05:32:55,349 --> 05:32:57,970
Guess who it's made by

4947
05:33:37,700 --> 05:33:42,819
What is he saying the shadow man? We have to free the shadow man from this game so he can live in peace

4948
05:33:43,700 --> 05:33:50,259
Don't get too distracted by the lore or else the zombies will get you. This is like a this haze is kind of making me hurt

5001
05:37:27,110 --> 05:37:34,049
I'm pushing forward a bit. We're almost to the box. I love that killjoy community chest

5002
05:37:34,610 --> 05:37:37,409
He's built a really interesting brand with his mouse

5003
05:37:38,930 --> 05:37:42,439
All right, who's gonna open this one?

5004
05:37:43,479 --> 05:37:46,529
Fine charge zombies rent

5005
05:37:47,169 --> 05:37:49,490
Yeah, put a hotel on there. Yeah, do it when they land on it

5006
05:37:50,049 --> 05:37:53,759
I think a better gun. How do I do that?

5007
05:37:53,919 --> 05:37:57,360
I think we gotta kill someone somebody just somebody just said that and it was uh,

5008
05:37:58,159 --> 05:37:59,119
Oh

5009
05:37:59,119 --> 05:38:00,479
I believe you

5010
05:38:00,479 --> 05:38:02,479
three parts

5011
05:38:05,040 --> 05:38:06,720
I'm down

5012
05:38:06,720 --> 05:38:08,720
Oh, are you? Help me

5013
05:38:09,439 --> 05:38:11,520
I have no god good gun

5014
05:38:12,479 --> 05:38:17,279
Axe ammo

5015
05:38:21,490 --> 05:38:23,090
Here it is

5016
05:38:23,090 --> 05:38:29,330
Oh my god, it's 9 50 hold f to take a chance. Oh, oh fuck. It wasn't a good chance. Okay

5017
05:38:30,450 --> 05:38:32,450
The odds hang on i'm gonna try

5018
05:38:32,849 --> 05:38:34,849
Don't touch this spending money

5019
05:38:34,930 --> 05:38:39,650
No, it's free, but i'm just making sure that it's safe for everyone. It's not don't touch this thing

5020
05:38:40,450 --> 05:38:42,529
I think he uses 10 bucks a pop actually

5021
05:38:43,590 --> 05:38:46,229
This is probably my so it doesn't do that's third time

5022
05:38:47,029 --> 05:38:48,549
three times a charm

5023
05:38:48,549 --> 05:38:52,549
I don't know if my odds are bad or what i'm gonna try to get you try it. I'll get you one

5024
05:38:53,430 --> 05:38:55,590
I think this is a kill on touch situation

5025
05:38:56,229 --> 05:38:57,909
Why do you guys keep doing that?

5026
05:38:57,909 --> 05:39:01,669
Because it seems like it takes some money when you use it, which means it might give you something

5027
05:39:02,470 --> 05:39:04,470
Hang on. We got ants to kill. I'm trying one more time

5028
05:39:05,750 --> 05:39:10,630
It's possible that you could do this and then hit the mega bonus. It's possible. It gives you something really good

5029
05:39:10,709 --> 05:39:12,310
You want to give it a go?

5030
05:39:12,310 --> 05:39:14,319
What's this thing?

5031
05:39:14,319 --> 05:39:16,880
Why is this thing red? Oh, I think he's the last one

5032
05:39:17,759 --> 05:39:23,360
Yeah, all right. Wait, wait for the next wave to start. I think I I think the chance is it's a chance to desync you

5033
05:39:23,360 --> 05:39:25,360
From the game i'm warping out

5034
05:39:26,529 --> 05:39:28,529
Don't feel stop chancing it dude

5035
05:39:28,930 --> 05:39:31,729
I'm like i'm getting this like this pop up on my screen

5036
05:39:32,209 --> 05:39:37,009
That shows something yanking out the ethernet cable of my computer and I don't know what's happening to me. What?

5037
05:39:38,049 --> 05:39:40,049
I think my internet is breaking down

5038
05:39:40,369 --> 05:39:42,369
Zombie shield dude

5039
05:39:43,250 --> 05:39:45,250
Lots of zombies

5040
05:39:46,720 --> 05:39:48,720

5041
05:39:49,119 --> 05:39:55,279
Oh, I think i'm dead. Don't even bother getting me up. I've entered like a twilight zone

5042
05:39:57,720 --> 05:40:01,880
Oh, they're moving the dice. Uh, oh, I think what if I dice a little bit? Oh, oh

5043
05:40:06,340 --> 05:40:09,029

5044
05:40:09,750 --> 05:40:12,310

05:43:32,709 --> 05:43:34,150
Oh, they're stuck

Kraken's got uh, the um window thing which means that on hit

5091
05:43:39,189 --> 05:43:41,189
Nobody can hit kraken right now

5092
05:43:43,279 --> 05:43:45,139
He's safe

5093
05:43:45,139 --> 05:43:46,819
He said he's alive

5094
05:43:46,819 --> 05:43:49,939
He's gonna be alive for about 10 more seconds until his charge runs out

5095
05:43:51,459 --> 05:43:55,279
Hurry up and get it back in here. Get those tacos

5096
05:43:56,000 --> 05:43:57,759
We did it

5097
05:43:57,759 --> 05:44:01,840
Yeah, I got a bomb you guys bad news. I haven't left yet still what?

5098
05:44:05,750 --> 05:44:07,750
Oh, this is bad. This is bad

5099
05:44:21,759 --> 05:44:28,259
It wasn't me this time I went brb last day wasn't me this time done five times

5100
05:44:31,439 --> 05:44:36,319
Hey, i'm i'm proud of you guys. We've never even made it past round two of the dice rolling

5101
05:44:37,040 --> 05:44:39,599
We made it all the way to go. We could have easily did it

5102
05:44:40,000 --> 05:44:43,919
We have a there's a technique of just jumping off and restarting at the beginning

5103
05:44:44,479 --> 05:44:47,700
Yeah, it's pretty you can see the end game of monopoly

5104
05:44:48,639 --> 05:44:52,450
Yeah, I mean and it's oh never mind the game bottom fragging

5105
05:44:53,810 --> 05:44:56,610
every time

5106
05:44:56,610 --> 05:44:57,490
It's too bad

5107
05:44:57,569 --> 05:45:03,650
I picked out a lot of there's a lot of other levels like a lot of clown levels and like creepy alien levels and

5108
05:45:05,009 --> 05:45:07,009
simpsons level

5109
05:45:07,569 --> 05:45:09,090
Just never get to the

5110
05:45:09,090 --> 05:45:12,770
Turkey survival actually had fully modeled turkeys clown

5111
05:45:14,049 --> 05:45:15,569
They were the zombies

5112
05:45:15,569 --> 05:45:16,689
That's why I picked it

5113
05:45:16,689 --> 05:45:22,130
There was one from there was a legacy one from last stream where it didn't have any real purpose behind it

5114
05:45:22,130 --> 05:45:26,689
But every zombie was for some reason pseudo voodoo the pokemon

5115
05:45:26,849 --> 05:45:32,689
I don't know why it wasn't in there was no description. Why it was just every zombie was pseudo voodoo. It just was

5116
05:45:33,169 --> 05:45:35,169
They were just pseudo voodoo

5117
05:45:35,810 --> 05:45:38,049
Which was pretty cool

5118
05:45:38,209 --> 05:45:41,330
So you guys you guys good to go you want to what's the I mean?

5119
05:45:41,330 --> 05:45:44,290
I don't know if I can host because james can't join me

5120
05:45:45,250 --> 05:45:50,529
But um, we have to see what the cranky boy wants to do since he's got his fucking gordita crunches

5121
05:45:50,529 --> 05:45:51,169
I mean, that's right

5122
05:45:51,169 --> 05:45:51,330
Yeah

5123
05:45:51,330 --> 05:45:55,169
It's like more of a situation of how much longer you guys want to go because there are plenty of maps the maps will

5124
05:45:55,169 --> 05:46:00,930
Go forever. So it's like whenever people pull the plug is when we wrap up because we're not going to run out of stuff to do

5125
05:46:01,169 --> 05:46:02,770
It's just more of like

5126
05:46:02,770 --> 05:46:04,369
You know

5127
05:46:04,369 --> 05:46:06,369
No, okay. It can only take so much

5128
05:46:08,450 --> 05:46:11,090
And then we don't come back to this for about a year ish

5129
05:46:13,959 --> 05:46:18,200
Are you gonna keep the maps downloaded? Yeah, it's all it's all it's all in one ever expanding

5130
05:46:18,439 --> 05:46:21,080
Map pack that I won't prune from the ones that we did

5131
05:46:21,159 --> 05:46:25,400
So anyone is interested in doing part three in like nine months

5132
05:46:25,880 --> 05:46:29,319
Uh, they can enjoy a 400 gigabyte download

5133
05:46:29,959 --> 05:46:31,959
I couldn't believe that seriously like when

5134
05:46:32,680 --> 05:46:37,560
He's like, oh, yeah kraken said it's a really big file. I'm like, yeah, whatever of course 10 gigs 20 gigs

5135
05:46:38,599 --> 05:46:42,119
Yeah, it took like it was huge. It was like my whole entire ssd

5136
05:46:43,159 --> 05:46:46,919
Yeah, it's it's a little gargantuan. I might i'll probably pretty big too

5137
05:46:47,479 --> 05:46:53,319
Yeah, the actual base game is like 60 or 70, isn't it? I think it's 90. It's like 89. Well, yeah

5138
05:46:53,319 --> 05:46:56,279
Well, that's part of it. I think this was around I think this was

5139
05:46:57,159 --> 05:46:59,159
I had to redownload the entire

5140
05:46:59,240 --> 05:47:04,520
Mod pack on stream like mine didn't download when we started so I was just quietly redownloading the whole mod pack

5141
05:47:04,840 --> 05:47:11,240
It was 150 gigabytes. So god, it's a little bit over double the game scale than at that point

5142
05:47:11,400 --> 05:47:13,400
So we're up at 250 ish

5143
05:47:14,680 --> 05:47:20,520
That's insane that I can right I mean I went through I got more or less everything that wasn't like completely garbage tier

5144
05:47:20,599 --> 05:47:22,599
Like obviously not worth playing

5145
05:47:23,159 --> 05:47:28,680
In this already so like honestly all that would be added for another session would be like new stuff and

5146
05:47:29,080 --> 05:47:33,479
I don't know how much new stuff that's good. Was the one on the the featured was the the

5147
05:47:34,200 --> 05:47:38,040
The fucking game of thrones one. Is that the one that's it looks like the same one that's featured

5148
05:47:38,040 --> 05:47:41,639
This one was new game of thrones is the one that's featured. Yeah, that one was brand new

5149
05:47:42,360 --> 05:47:44,360
Came out came out on the 14th. Yeah

5150
05:47:44,520 --> 05:47:45,799
Yeah

5151
05:47:45,799 --> 05:47:46,919
Like they're still updated

5152
05:47:47,000 --> 05:47:51,560
There's still new mods being made for this and some of them are honestly like you if you look like

5153
05:47:52,759 --> 05:47:59,000
There's actually good maps like there are good zombies maps on this obviously we didn't touch any of the actual good ones

5154
05:47:59,080 --> 05:48:03,400
But I made it is black ops 4 or not doesn't have it. Why black ops 3?

5155
05:48:04,200 --> 05:48:07,000
Well, I don't know why it's black ops 3. That's like the most

5156
05:48:08,520 --> 05:48:13,000
Don't all of them all of them have it but like they have to win. It's just that they don't have moddable

5157
05:48:13,240 --> 05:48:16,680
They did yeah, they didn't have the mod tools out right? Yeah, they don't have workshop

5158
05:48:17,400 --> 05:48:20,200
Like integration and that's what's made this so, you know

5159
05:48:20,599 --> 05:48:21,720
Okay

5160
05:48:21,720 --> 05:48:23,959
Did we win? No, we lost. No, we didn't win

5161
05:48:24,840 --> 05:48:26,040
oh

5162
05:48:26,040 --> 05:48:31,479
You were you were invincible for like 15 seconds held out for one more round after you left and then it went to shit

5163
05:48:32,119 --> 05:48:39,479
Remember pokemon sun and moon now. I remember that one. No, it was bad. Yeah. I remember that one now

5164
05:48:45,540 --> 05:48:49,619
Well, i'll give you i'll give you my uh, i'm down if you guys want to do any more

5165
05:48:49,779 --> 05:48:51,540
I'll be around for a little while

5166
05:48:51,540 --> 05:48:54,900
If uh, if we want to I got like we could play like a wind down one

5167
05:48:54,900 --> 05:49:02,020
That's like probably decent that I saw that actually intrigued me or we can play more trash garbage like cheese cube recheese

5168
05:49:03,220 --> 05:49:07,540
We've got options on both fronts. I will do anything. Whatever you guys i'm good for another one

5169
05:49:10,840 --> 05:49:12,840
Your mic is really low quiet

5170
05:49:13,490 --> 05:49:16,689
I'm fine to stick around for a little bit longer. It's not like I have anything. Okay cheese

5171
05:49:17,569 --> 05:49:19,569
I didn't want to see more. Uh

5172
05:49:20,689 --> 05:49:23,349
What do we feel on I I could be either the meme one or

5173
05:49:24,069 --> 05:49:29,430
The real one. I got a gordita crunch here with my name on it, but i'm also you know, happy to wait

5174
05:49:31,650 --> 05:49:33,650
I don't mind. It's up to you guys

5175
05:49:34,740 --> 05:49:39,700
There's a lot here. Let's do two more then. Yeah, okay. Uh, let's do

5176
05:49:40,659 --> 05:49:45,619
This one looks like it would be pretty good like actually like a decent map actually good

5177
05:49:46,979 --> 05:49:49,360
Sure

5178
05:49:49,360 --> 05:49:53,040
It's like a western themed cowboy one. That's an actual map. So

5179
05:49:53,680 --> 05:49:55,680
Wanted yeah

5180
05:49:56,549 --> 05:49:59,189
So is cheese cube just like a piece of absolute shit

5181
05:50:00,470 --> 05:50:04,709
He's assuming I think a lot of cheese cube is inevitably going to be garbage trash like

5182
05:50:05,509 --> 05:50:11,509
Go to solo and uh, look at the picture hover a picture under the maps. You can see it on cheese cube

5183
05:50:11,590 --> 05:50:13,590
There's a lot of cheese themed maps

5184
05:50:13,830 --> 05:50:19,590
All of them are completely garbage and I don't know why a bunch of different people make these maps cheese cube

5185
05:50:19,590 --> 05:50:22,310
Because like never the same person is what somebody just said

5186
05:50:22,950 --> 05:50:24,950
They don't go out here

5187
05:50:25,110 --> 05:50:29,270
That's like the whole mentality of the meme is that you see someone makes a cheese cube map and you say well

5188
05:50:29,270 --> 05:50:32,069
It must be good and then you make a cheese cube map. That's also fucking

5189
05:50:32,709 --> 05:50:37,590
Trash garbage and then you know the cycle continues. Uh, I don't oh there it is wanted. Okay

5190
05:50:39,200 --> 05:50:44,560
Now i'm only talking about like pictures that I saw wanted looked pretty good. Somebody said the cheese maps are challenge maps

5191
05:50:45,200 --> 05:50:47,889
I do like cheese

5192
05:50:48,209 --> 05:50:52,130
Cheese in the name they're for high level, uh zombies players only

5193
05:50:53,090 --> 05:50:57,490
That's us. Well, I'd say that's us. We almost beat monopoly. We almost need monopoly. That's pretty

5194
05:50:58,529 --> 05:51:05,119
I'd like I mean, I don't want to toot my own horn, but you know, I will I had about like a go ahead

5195
05:51:06,159 --> 05:51:09,200
No, I don't like to do that. Yeah, I had like a 40 headshot ratio

5196
05:51:10,720 --> 05:51:16,259
I didn't get I get I didn't give her many kills craig and the lobby is not joinable. Can you invite me again?

5197
05:51:18,740 --> 05:51:22,979

My friend's game gotta tell you I hear that I can smell it I hear

5202
05:51:41,700 --> 05:51:47,139
I can smell the cheese in this cheesy gordita crunch a mile away as i'm as i'm picking it up

5203
05:51:48,720 --> 05:51:52,560
It's got a pungent odor for sure. Yeah, i'm not gonna do a taco camp guys

5204
05:51:53,119 --> 05:51:56,639
I I look i'm like the scum of the earth right now. I'm like

If I turn on that star wars 3am bits midnight bits like from the keyboard and mouse. Thank you so much though

5285
05:58:29,669 --> 05:58:33,590
It's very good. Remember when I made two thousand dollars earlier. Yeah, it was fucking insane

5286
05:58:34,310 --> 05:58:38,150
It was gonna be honest. Thank you so much for the fifty dollars. I don't like pepsi very much

5287
05:58:39,189 --> 05:58:41,590
All right, you don't like pepsi. It's pepsi. Okay

5288
05:58:42,639 --> 05:58:46,560
Is it weird? I can't tell if you gave me a glass of pepsi and a glass of coke

5289
05:58:46,560 --> 05:58:51,119
I would not be able to identify the difference because I don't really care about soda. They're pretty they're pretty different

5290
05:58:51,279 --> 05:58:55,200
I think I just don't I don't feel like I could notice. I just don't

5291
05:58:56,000 --> 05:58:56,959
care

5292
05:58:56,959 --> 05:58:58,400
brave

5293
05:58:58,400 --> 05:59:00,799
Thanks everybody. I was just gonna say brave

5294
05:59:01,759 --> 05:59:06,720
Squeeze just take a lemon and juice like a half a lemon squeeze the lemon into your water and just put it like a

5295
05:59:06,720 --> 05:59:11,279
Teaspoon of sugar and then stir it up and drink it. Don't don't don't drink so bad. That'd be tea

5296
05:59:12,400 --> 05:59:14,400
Are you saying like this is that PSA?

5297
05:59:16,400 --> 05:59:19,919
Yeah, that's the you're on the right one if everyone can join james looks like he's

5298
05:59:20,720 --> 05:59:26,799
I'm gonna have to force crash steam, but i'm you know, i'll be there in a second. I'm being like fucking crazy

5299
05:59:28,479 --> 05:59:30,479
Hey, thanks for the 10 community subs pin

5300
05:59:32,439 --> 05:59:35,959
Man 10 community subs. Thank you. I don't think i've ever tried rc cola

5301
05:59:36,439 --> 05:59:37,799
How do you guys feel about rc cola?

5302
05:59:37,799 --> 05:59:40,279
I've never heard of it because I live out in the middle of fucking nowhere

5303
05:59:40,520 --> 05:59:44,919
Is that water with a lemon in it? I think that's more reason that you should probably have heard of

5304
05:59:46,599 --> 05:59:49,400
With the lemon in it you didn't squeeze the lemon into it. It's not my thing

5305
05:59:49,400 --> 05:59:51,959
So i'm not gonna say i'm not gonna answer that it's not like

5306
05:59:52,759 --> 05:59:54,200
for me

5307
05:59:54,200 --> 05:59:59,400
Is this like uh like off-brand cola, but I don't like cola

5308
05:59:59,799 --> 06:00:04,119
But how do you get more bootleg than cola feel like the mass produce it enough that you know, that's cheaper

5309
06:00:04,680 --> 06:00:08,680
Rc cola isn't it like a full dollar per can cheaper or something? Yeah, it's cheaper

5310
06:00:08,680 --> 06:00:11,159
But I don't understand why like how do they make it cheaper?

5311
06:00:12,610 --> 06:00:15,090
Because when you buy a mac you think like the mac tastes better

5312
06:00:16,400 --> 06:00:18,080
That's the reason

5313
06:00:18,080 --> 06:00:21,279
It's like a oh a computer. Yeah, it's like this. It's a reason

5314
06:00:21,279 --> 06:00:23,279
It's a reason why why are you eating your max dude?

5315
06:00:23,279 --> 06:00:27,040

I mean this game uses a lot. I stuttered there for a second

5387
06:06:23,319 --> 06:06:26,599
I think it's the particle effects of the why are you on fire again?

5388
06:06:27,319 --> 06:06:29,319
I just wanted to see if I could jump it

5389

Wait, where what are we talking this lava here? You can't jump it

5390
06:06:33,409 --> 06:06:35,409
Out. What is this?

5391

There's something here. There's a horse. Oh, there's a light shovel. Yeah

5392
06:06:38,930 --> 06:06:42,049
Yeah, don't look at the train. Were you looking at the train cracking? Oh, maybe

5393
06:06:42,930 --> 06:06:45,090
Don't look at the train. I think the particles of the engine

5394
06:06:47,799 --> 06:06:49,479
Oh

5395
06:06:49,479 --> 06:06:51,479

What the fuck how'd they mod is this like from a different black ops or like call of duty game?

5463
06:11:57,639 --> 06:11:59,799
I don't think there's a way they modded this at this point

5464
06:11:59,880 --> 06:12:03,639
This must have been like from a different call of duty and they like ported it in like the bats and stuff

5465
06:12:04,279 --> 06:12:10,200
What other call of duty has fucking bats like the I mean, I don't know. There's a western themed, uh zombies map in one of them

5466
06:12:10,759 --> 06:12:12,360
but

5467
06:12:12,360 --> 06:12:16,840
I don't think that is this bats behind us bats coming in hot behind us

5468
06:12:17,639 --> 06:12:21,400
I need a weapon. I'm too dumb to play this game here. Come to me

5469
06:12:21,560 --> 06:12:25,159
Come to me inside the bar. There's a really good one on the stairs over here

5470
06:12:26,439 --> 06:12:29,639
Get one on the wall. So you have like actual ammo to get back. This one's pretty good

5471
06:12:31,779 --> 06:12:36,259
Oh atomic guns, these bats are like stuck underneath the fucking bottom of this

5472
06:12:37,060 --> 06:12:39,060
What is going on with this?

5473
06:12:39,299 --> 06:12:41,540
Wait, this is just a regular black ops 3 map. No way

5474
06:12:42,099 --> 06:12:46,419
No way. We just played an actual map. That was wait. This is not a modern map

5475
06:12:47,299 --> 06:12:51,299
This is not no, this is a mod. This is a mod. I was gonna say this is pretty well done. Okay

5476
06:12:52,180 --> 06:12:57,459
Black ops 3 has a call of Cthulhu type map and has bad enemies. Okay, so yeah, I mean, okay

5477
06:12:57,779 --> 06:12:59,779
Yeah, the what the enemies make sense reported

5478
06:13:00,819 --> 06:13:04,340
That was the map I was talking about the hat that was like a city. Where's that box?

5479
06:13:04,500 --> 06:13:06,500
I'm gonna get rid of this crossbow

5480
06:13:07,779 --> 06:13:10,500
Box is behind the saloon behind the saloon

5481
06:13:11,619 --> 06:13:14,819
Should we start opening more doors like a lot of money? Just look up into the air. I was gonna go

5482
06:13:14,979 --> 06:13:16,979
You'll see the light. Oh, right, right

5483
06:13:17,459 --> 06:13:24,279
Oh, sorry should I go into the cemetery I can go into the cemetery

5484
06:13:25,799 --> 06:13:31,159
Oh a model 1887. It's just this little sibling that your mom makes you take with you

5485
06:13:32,200 --> 06:13:34,200
ban that guy for life

5486
06:13:37,000 --> 06:13:41,159
Someone's making fun of me. I'm just gonna get banned for life. Your character's actually voiced by Jeff Goldblum

5487
06:13:41,560 --> 06:13:43,560
Is my chat shitting out like with me?

5488
06:13:44,520 --> 06:13:46,119
Are they shitting with me?

5489
06:13:46,119 --> 06:13:48,119
Or no

5490
06:13:49,400 --> 06:13:50,840
Oh shit

5491
06:13:50,840 --> 06:13:53,759
I'm like lagging all over the place on this map though

5492
06:13:54,959 --> 06:14:01,569
I'm gonna go into the jail. I opened the door to the jail

5493
06:14:02,290 --> 06:14:05,090
Cool, that's in here

5494
06:14:05,090 --> 06:14:10,930
Wow, there's a model 1903 in here. Whoa, I got I got a part for some goop in the cage

5495
06:14:11,009 --> 06:14:13,009
Is that what you that was pretty good?

5496
06:14:13,250 --> 06:14:17,840
Need to turn the power on that storm down

5497
06:14:18,479 --> 06:14:23,840
Hold for part. I got a part two

5498
06:14:23,840 --> 06:14:25,759
I opened up this back way

5499
06:14:25,840 --> 06:14:29,439
The stables so we want to open up the way to the church. Oh, I found another part

5500
06:14:29,439 --> 06:14:33,599
We need a key for the church. Well, those people look that yeah, I don't feel bad. They went to heaven

5501
06:14:39,759 --> 06:14:41,759
You need a key

5502
06:14:43,299 --> 06:14:51,000
Insta kill I regret picking that up so quick. Oh, I found a shovel. I can go back in. Uh, oh, yeah

5503
06:14:51,720 --> 06:14:54,599
There's a bunch. There's one over here James behind the inn

5504
06:14:55,560 --> 06:14:58,919
There's so many places to go. I just want here too. Yeah

5505
06:15:00,869 --> 06:15:02,869
Where at right here right here?

5506
06:15:05,520 --> 06:15:08,470
What is that? Oh

5507
06:15:08,470 --> 06:15:10,470
Dude, what the fuck?

5508
06:15:10,709 --> 06:15:12,470
Give you a power up

5509
06:15:12,470 --> 06:15:15,889
Oh looks like this is where we turn on the power, but we need the key

5510
06:15:17,090 --> 06:15:21,889
Dude, I'm really liking this submarine aim. Uh downsides look here

5511
06:15:23,700 --> 06:15:25,700
Are you using that gun? Yeah

5512
06:15:26,020 --> 06:15:34,930
It's really cool. It's got a good submarine attack, uh, rectangle. I don't know if this is a mod though this gun

5513
06:15:35,810 --> 06:15:39,810
Feels like too good to not be like made by a professional leader

5514
06:15:40,979 --> 06:15:42,020
Oh

5515
06:15:44,840 --> 06:15:46,360
Max ammo

5516
06:15:46,360 --> 06:15:47,560
ice

5517
06:15:47,560 --> 06:15:52,400
What happened to the crawler? There was a crawler over here. Oh, there it is

5518
06:15:52,799 --> 06:15:54,799
There's a crawler over here and he's coming in with me

5519
06:15:55,279 --> 06:15:58,319
It's freaking me out. I'm gonna just look a guy close him in here. There's a door

5520
06:15:58,959 --> 06:16:02,639
I have another one over here like a slower one if you want to kill that one

5521
06:16:03,279 --> 06:16:05,299
All right. I'm gonna

5522
06:16:05,299 --> 06:16:08,979
How do we get the gum back? I want to fill up the gobble gum machine how

5523
06:16:09,860 --> 06:16:14,919
horses in the bag

5524
06:16:15,159 --> 06:16:18,040
We're done. What else do I do?

5525
06:16:18,599 --> 06:16:24,599
Like a 2,900 or buy some more doors. I don't know where though. There's a cemetery by the church

5526
06:16:27,000 --> 06:16:30,759
Oh shit, I got a big revolver come back around 12 to get gums

5527
06:16:33,169 --> 06:16:35,169
Jesus there's no way. This is mod

5528
06:16:38,930 --> 06:16:41,490
Oh crack it take a look at this

5529
06:16:42,369 --> 06:16:46,209
Where does this does this look like a mod gun to you? It's like a big

5530
06:16:46,849 --> 06:16:48,930
Revolver. Well, you're holding it kind of goofy

5531
06:16:49,569 --> 06:16:56,369
But yeah, I found out how to turn on the power. I mean, it's like it's all modeled and like so what does the power do?

5532
06:16:57,409 --> 06:16:59,330
I think you just turn it on on the side of the house

5533
06:16:59,409 --> 06:17:03,409
I just turn a valve there's a valve on the side of the house and I guess maybe that power

5534
06:17:03,569 --> 06:17:08,529
Oh, wait, it did it powered it powered the jail. The machine in here is on the phd. Ah

5535
06:17:09,330 --> 06:17:13,200
whoops

5536
06:17:13,200 --> 06:17:17,759
I'm gonna open the uh, is there any other places we haven't opened? There's a cemetery right here

5537
06:17:17,919 --> 06:17:19,919
Yeah, there's keys we need to open the rest

5538
06:17:20,319 --> 06:17:24,639
I opened the cemetery. I opened it both ways and there's a bunch of things to dig with the shovel

5539
06:17:25,360 --> 06:17:29,680
James what's up? Well, isn't that bad luck digging in a cemetery? No, I do put in

5540
06:17:32,159 --> 06:17:37,459
Hold on i'm about to there's a wait. What do you mean do over here dig this? Uh, dig this hole

5541
06:17:38,819 --> 06:17:42,979
Dig up this. Uh, i'm a goner. Yeah this person. Okay, this is just

5542
06:17:44,020 --> 06:17:46,900
I don't want no part of this. I gotta go around no come back

5543
06:17:47,619 --> 06:17:49,939
Oh, oh, but you'll shoot the casket the one that's out

5544
06:17:55,250 --> 06:17:57,250
Oh, that's bad luck

5545
06:17:58,290 --> 06:18:02,450
We should probably open up the uh, y'all should I uh buy this heart?

5546
06:18:03,860 --> 06:18:05,220
Yeah

5547
06:18:05,220 --> 06:18:06,900
It's 1500

5548
06:18:06,900 --> 06:18:08,900
Buy it activates a trap

5549
06:18:09,459 --> 06:18:11,700
Oh it activates a trap and yeah

5550
06:18:12,099 --> 06:18:14,099
Wait, what are we waiting for?

5551
06:18:14,740 --> 06:18:18,419
I mean, there's just a crawler just to buy up as much as you can

5552
06:18:19,919 --> 06:18:24,240
I'm gonna hang out in the salon. Is there a juggernaut anywhere or juggernaut?

5553
06:18:25,520 --> 06:18:27,200
No

5554
06:18:27,200 --> 06:18:31,439
Oh, I can craft an antler shield here guys. There's a shield where i'm standing. I thought I crafted

5555
06:18:33,560 --> 06:18:35,240
A stand a shield

5556
06:18:35,240 --> 06:18:39,159
It's a shield. Yeah, it's like, uh, can we you can operate this, um this minigun?

5557
06:18:39,639 --> 06:18:41,639
Or is that something that just does it automatically?

5558
06:18:43,840 --> 06:18:48,560
You probably gotta pay to do it. You guys want this shield? It's free if you uh walk up and grab it. Yeah

5559
06:18:49,360 --> 06:18:55,360
Free stuff, I mean, yeah, uh when you press two you can pull it out and you can push through a whole horde of zombies

5560
06:18:57,200 --> 06:18:58,880
It's really strong

5561
06:18:58,880 --> 06:19:00,880
Oh, there's a little crawler, huh? We get them

5562
06:19:02,610 --> 06:19:04,150
Oh

5563
06:19:04,150 --> 06:19:06,150
I did that from across the map

5564
06:19:07,189 --> 06:19:12,229
Come over here grab this here. Oh, there's juggernaut right here. What the fuck. Wait, where oh i'm going over there

5565
06:19:13,840 --> 06:19:16,520

Where is it? We'll get it in this room. Take this take this down

5567
06:19:23,090 --> 06:19:31,060
Crack it take the shield. Oh, it wasn't that far. That was like 2 000 kilometers away. Crack it. Ah

5568
06:19:32,020 --> 06:19:35,299
What am I looking at that's like lagging every single time?

5569
06:19:36,020 --> 06:19:37,700
Ah

5570
06:19:37,700 --> 06:19:41,220
This map is slowly killing my computer

5571
06:19:41,779 --> 06:19:45,860
I think it's the train

5572
06:20:04,680 --> 06:20:07,159

Is it I bet it looks so cool

5586
06:20:59,040 --> 06:21:02,240
It did look pretty cool. All right, here we go. Let's see if it looks cool in practice

5587
06:21:03,599 --> 06:21:06,319
It looks cool because you're on fire while you're fucking swinging it

5588
06:21:08,240 --> 06:21:16,840
It's like always when I go when I come down he's down

5589
06:21:17,889 --> 06:21:19,009
Yeah

5590
06:21:19,009 --> 06:21:24,130

5682
06:28:00,360 --> 06:28:02,259
Yeah

5683
06:28:02,259 --> 06:28:04,900
It's a portal to the future. Oh, don't worry. It's not open yet

5684
06:28:05,939 --> 06:28:07,220
What?

5685
06:28:07,220 --> 06:28:11,220

5686
06:28:12,659 --> 06:28:14,580
No, no

5687
06:28:14,580 --> 06:28:15,939
He's dead

5688
06:28:15,939 --> 06:28:18,340
We can be free cracking. We just have to kill him

5689
06:28:19,139 --> 06:28:21,139
No, we have to let him die

5690
06:28:21,299 --> 06:28:23,700
Oh, I got you have to get me up you have to

5691
06:28:25,200 --> 06:28:28,400
Oh, they got me. I'm sorry james. They knocked me down

5692
06:28:30,049 --> 06:28:33,889
But they I think they knocked me down james. He's so far away

5693
06:28:34,689 --> 06:28:38,209
You have to worry cranking will get you and me you have to get me. You have to get me

5694
06:28:38,290 --> 06:28:41,650
She's a good eater cron. I actually did knock me down. I was trying to get you

5695
06:28:42,610 --> 06:28:44,610
I just want to look at an image of it

5696
06:28:46,529 --> 06:28:48,529
Nice

5697
06:28:50,180 --> 06:28:55,220
I don't have like postmates or things to order food with so I actually have to just think about the taco bell

5698
06:28:55,299 --> 06:28:58,020
Cheesy gordita crunch and I don't get to act on that urge

5699
06:28:58,740 --> 06:29:02,180
Oh, thanks for the res man

5700
06:29:02,180 --> 06:29:04,740
My buddies used to get these urges to go

5701
06:29:05,540 --> 06:29:07,540
Fast food, but when you know you get lazy

5702
06:29:08,419 --> 06:29:11,779
You'd always it's true. You always end up just going if you don't have food

5703
06:29:11,779 --> 06:29:15,939
You don't have the means to get some, you know restaurant near you or something

5704
06:29:16,180 --> 06:29:20,580
It was always a bowl of cereal. Fuck suck that that sucks. You know what I mean?

5705
06:29:21,299 --> 06:29:26,340
Or a bologna and cheese sandwich. It's just like that's never the same. It sounds like some fucking first world problem

5706
06:29:27,139 --> 06:29:29,700
It's never the same. You know what I mean? Like a bowl of cereal

5707
06:29:30,259 --> 06:29:34,819
Oh, oh you guys you guys all get to act like that, but that is what i'm gonna do when I go upstairs

5708
06:29:34,900 --> 06:29:36,900
I don't have options like

5709
06:29:36,979 --> 06:29:39,700
No, it used to be like that i'm going to go upstairs. I'm going to open my fridge

5710
06:29:39,779 --> 06:29:44,340
I'm gonna go turkey sounds good. I'm gonna pull out like a slice of turkey right put it in my mouth

5711
06:29:44,659 --> 06:29:47,139
And that's my fucking day. All right, because I can't just

5712
06:29:47,860 --> 06:29:49,380
I know because here's the situation

5713
06:29:49,380 --> 06:29:55,060
Okay, I can't like they had postmates here where I lived for like a day and then the driver was like fuck that shit

5714
06:29:55,060 --> 06:29:59,169
And he 180 degree right out of town. He left and since then

5715
06:30:00,069 --> 06:30:05,909
I'm out here in the sticks alone. I used to eat a dry ass one slice one slice dry

5716
06:30:08,229 --> 06:30:10,310
Dry ass no mayo nothing

5717
06:30:10,310 --> 06:30:13,270
It was just a dry sandwich with a piece of bologna and a piece of cheese

5718
06:30:14,369 --> 06:30:15,409
And I was like this sucks

5719
06:30:15,409 --> 06:30:19,569
When you're deprived options you get like it to honestly like there's no at a certain point

5720
06:30:19,569 --> 06:30:23,119
There's no creativity in my meal. Like I just like there's no options

5721
06:30:23,119 --> 06:30:26,479
So I might as well just eat the most the most absolute basic shit, you know

5722
06:30:26,639 --> 06:30:28,479
That's what it's that's what it comes down to now

5723
06:30:28,560 --> 06:30:31,279
And it always you open up the pantry or whatever and you just see it

5724
06:30:31,279 --> 06:30:35,840
It's something so basic that you can't you can't even stand it. It's like corn flakes or something

5725
06:30:36,479 --> 06:30:39,840
It's just like god did why did why didn't I buy like the s'mores cereal?

5726
06:30:40,000 --> 06:30:42,000
Um for this very reason

5727
06:30:43,599 --> 06:30:48,159
I mean my situation is that like I only go shopping like once like a week and I end up blowing all the nice stuff

5728
06:30:48,159 --> 06:30:51,360
I would have eaten over the course of the first two days and the rest of the fucking week is like

5729
06:30:51,759 --> 06:30:53,599
a ramen

5730
06:30:53,599 --> 06:30:57,520
Fucking bagel like for like the next five days. Yeah shaking my head the whole time dude

5731
06:30:57,599 --> 06:30:59,599
I do the same thing with like drinks

5732
06:31:00,240 --> 06:31:02,799
I go get like a carton of orange juice if it's gone in two days

5733
06:31:04,630 --> 06:31:07,909
Yeah, uh, this will last me a week and I drink the whole thing in a day

5734
06:31:08,790 --> 06:31:13,439
Yep, and like yeah, I know that i'm sitting there because I can't I can't order new stuff

5735
06:31:13,520 --> 06:31:18,720
And it's too inconvenient to take the trip back. I'm glad someone finally understands me man. That's that's really what i'm telling you

5736
06:31:18,799 --> 06:31:20,799
It feels like all these people from the city, man. They don't

5737
06:31:21,279 --> 06:31:23,279
Wait, you guys he just said he was from vegas

5738
06:31:26,639 --> 06:31:28,639
He's lying to you

5739
06:31:32,959 --> 06:31:35,720
I just was trying to use empathy

5740
06:31:35,720 --> 06:31:37,720
A friend

5741
06:31:38,040 --> 06:31:40,689
I trusted you

5742
06:31:40,689 --> 06:31:42,689
I'm taking my bagels elsewhere

5743
06:31:44,180 --> 06:31:50,659
Yeah in vegas I could I could go walk down the street and find like a five-star steak right now. What is it 2 a.m?

5744
06:31:55,029 --> 06:32:00,630
All right, I after that I gotta go I gotta eat something I gotta find like some slop to put in my mouth

5745
06:32:02,470 --> 06:32:08,470
Well, it's been fun guys. Thank you for humoring us in our uh, yeah, uh, it's pretty fun. No, it's cool

06:32:27,009 --> 06:32:29,009
I heard him say don't follow all their channels

5752
06:32:29,569 --> 06:32:31,569
What and then?

5753
06:32:31,810 --> 06:32:36,529
I didn't say that did I I think he just said that I definitely heard that. Uh, well

5754
06:32:37,490 --> 06:32:39,490
That killed the mood for me. Yeah, like

5755
06:32:40,529 --> 06:32:42,529
I didn't say that did I did not

5756
06:32:43,810 --> 06:32:49,490
Yeah, that's like it's in this one thing off. Yeah, we're turning it off. All right, i'm not gonna support this behavior

5757
06:32:52,799 --> 06:32:54,799
No, not the squad anything about the squad

Uh, thank you so much for the thousands of dollars. It's not even a joke

You know, it's just whenever it happens it happens, right?

5778
06:34:35,040 --> 06:34:39,040
But uh, let's get the it is getting late. So I want to kind of

5779
06:34:39,759 --> 06:34:45,090
It's very late. It's almost four o'clock in the morning eastern. So

5780
06:34:45,729 --> 06:34:50,599
i'm gonna turn this off because

5781
06:34:55,490 --> 06:34:58,369
And let's go back about uh, six and a half hours ago

5782
06:34:59,090 --> 06:35:03,889
So i'll be starting to like three or four

5783
06:35:04,529 --> 06:35:09,119
normal time tomorrow

5784
06:35:09,119 --> 06:35:11,880
Not like it was today

5785
06:35:11,880 --> 06:35:13,080
but

5786
06:35:13,080 --> 06:35:15,319
We had the the insane

5787
06:35:17,340 --> 06:35:18,479
1700

5788
06:35:18,479 --> 06:35:20,479
almost 1800 dollars from

5789
06:35:21,110 --> 06:35:23,110
somebody named jeremiah's massive dong

5790
06:35:25,860 --> 06:35:29,380
And I yeah, it was fucking out of control. It was a lot of money

5791
06:35:31,569 --> 06:35:35,000
I

5792
06:35:35,000 --> 06:35:38,869
Not much else to say on that

5793
06:35:38,869 --> 06:35:41,669
That's how we started it out freudian weapon gave 250

5794
06:35:44,930 --> 06:35:47,490
Regardless of the start time. These streams are always a hoot

5795
06:35:49,080 --> 06:35:51,080
Jerma Hartway appreciate you

5796
06:35:52,659 --> 06:35:55,279
I appreciate you too

5797
06:35:55,279 --> 06:35:59,759
Yeah, I wouldn't have started this late unless there was a reason to push it forward by that much which obviously

5798
06:36:00,720 --> 06:36:03,520
Pretty good reason

5799
06:36:03,520 --> 06:36:04,799
It's always fun

5800
06:36:04,799 --> 06:36:10,689
I might i'm sorry. I wasn't really that great at black ops zombies tonight was the only experience i've ever had

5801
06:36:12,229 --> 06:36:14,799
i've never played it

5802
06:36:14,799 --> 06:36:18,799
And I don't play call of duty either. So it was still fun

5803
06:36:21,939 --> 06:36:24,080
Oh then we had

5804
06:36:24,080 --> 06:36:26,560

5805
06:36:27,200 --> 06:36:34,369
Dork cube gave 250 i'm hiding my bits next to mr. Moneybags donations

5806
06:36:36,229 --> 06:36:41,720
They still got through you may have been the worst player i've ever seen

5807
06:36:44,500 --> 06:36:46,020
Yeah, but like

5808
06:36:46,020 --> 06:36:48,020
I don't even know what any of these guns do

5809
06:36:49,650 --> 06:36:52,049
I don't even know what I don't know what the power-ups are

5811
06:37:01,250 --> 06:37:17,729
Just shoot gun at monsters is all I know just shoot

5812
06:37:21,860 --> 06:37:26,200
Yeah, I didn't do the tutorial i'm talking like the black ops 3 tutorial

5813
06:37:27,430 --> 06:37:31,110
Last time I opened a call of duty game was I think modern warfare 3

5814
06:37:33,250 --> 06:37:35,970
Well black ops 2 maybe like 10 years ago

5815
06:37:41,159 --> 06:37:44,369
I don't know

5816
06:37:44,369 --> 06:37:48,049
And nothing has changed. Yeah, but i've been playing zombies. It's like a completely different game mode

5817
06:37:55,459 --> 06:37:57,459
Uh, but drosophilia. Thanks with five dollars

But my favorite level was probably the if no, what was my favorite level?

5830
06:38:54,630 --> 06:39:04,400
Probably the game of thrones one. That was just cool. It's fun and funny

5831
06:39:04,880 --> 06:39:11,250

5850
06:40:51,860 --> 06:40:54,819
I can't even believe i'm having this conversation that that much money is coming through

5851
06:41:03,439 --> 06:41:05,439
It's fucking remarkable to me

5852
06:41:07,639 --> 06:41:13,250
Thank you

5853
06:41:13,250 --> 06:41:15,250
Uh flimflam ten dollars from flimflam

5854
06:41:16,080 --> 06:41:19,040
Surely such a massive streamer getting such a massive amount of money

5855
06:41:20,000 --> 06:41:24,400
Mainly from one massive dong warrants a massive stream announcement for the near future

5856
06:41:25,040 --> 06:41:29,700
Well, I already talked about this is this already this whole this stream paid for the dunk tank stream

5857
06:41:31,000 --> 06:41:33,400
That might cost a few thousand dollars at least

5858
06:41:34,279 --> 06:41:36,279
So there it is

5859
06:41:40,950 --> 06:41:42,950
Depending on how what needs to happen

5860
06:41:43,430 --> 06:41:50,150
I sure I probably should hear back from

5861
06:41:50,869 --> 06:41:53,189

5862
06:41:54,580 --> 06:41:58,470

Sorry, I haven't been catching up. What memes have I missed?

5878
06:43:00,040 --> 06:43:02,389

5885
06:43:39,430 --> 06:43:42,869
That may be one of the last times I ever played the game. That was like six years ago

5886
06:43:43,509 --> 06:43:50,099
And I didn't even play that that was my that was grandpa

Um, mr. Biffy thanks for the four dollars germa, why does your door look like it's screaming?

5897
06:44:54,150 --> 06:44:56,150
I don't really have time to play this now

5898
06:44:56,950 --> 06:44:58,950
This is a full episode of television

5899
06:44:59,430 --> 06:45:02,740
It's a long one

5900
06:45:02,740 --> 06:45:04,979
I might open with this tomorrow

5901
06:45:07,009 --> 06:45:09,009
Because it's very very late

5902
06:45:09,409 --> 06:45:11,810
It's like 4 a.m. Eastern. I'd rather

5903
06:45:12,529 --> 06:45:14,049
do this when

5904
06:45:14,049 --> 06:45:18,689
It's not so so late. This is fucking list. I'm like just i'm not gonna scroll that far

5905
06:45:18,689 --> 06:45:20,689
But this looks like it's very well made

5906
06:45:21,880 --> 06:45:27,759
Make sure to remind me to do this tomorrow because this is like a full episode of television

5907
06:45:28,709 --> 06:45:30,869

Or you know, you know, you know, you know what friday is like i'm gonna be a chill day where we just

06:45:40,479 --> 06:45:48,049
Because tomorrow i'm gonna play a game but friday, we're just gonna do whatever

5911
06:45:48,610 --> 06:45:52,000
So remind me on friday that we're gonna watch this

5912
06:45:52,639 --> 06:45:54,639
It seems like something good just to do right

5913
06:45:54,639 --> 06:46:02,790
What am I playing tomorrow? The plan is to do cauliflower as gunslinger

5914
06:46:04,340 --> 06:46:06,099
Unless something else comes up

5915
06:46:06,099 --> 06:46:09,029
But i'm, not sure we'll see

5916
06:46:09,029 --> 06:46:14,069
Tomorrow is friday. Yeah, but you know what I mean like not tomorrow not friday stream

5917
06:46:15,619 --> 06:46:24,360
I mean not uh, not thursday stream friday stream because thursday technically is today, right?

5918
06:46:28,200 --> 06:46:28,919

5919
06:46:28,919 --> 06:46:30,919
Thomas win thanks for the five dollars

5920
06:46:31,159 --> 06:46:33,880

That we're gonna watch on like the chill friday stream

5922
06:46:37,979 --> 06:46:45,500
I'm, not sure how long the stream will be on friday, but I did I kind of want to get something out there

5923
06:46:47,639 --> 06:46:51,529
We'll do a few fun things

5924
06:46:51,529 --> 06:46:56,759
But thank you for audience weapon. Thanks for the 250. I was never crazy about cod

5925
06:46:56,759 --> 06:46:59,639
But this stream makes me reconsider looks like fun derma jex

5926
06:47:02,180 --> 06:47:06,680
It was it was fun. I feel like it took me like

5927
06:47:07,319 --> 06:47:10,119
A couple hours to kind of get into the element in the zone there though

5928
06:47:13,340 --> 06:47:15,740
Which just came from vr chat

5929
06:47:16,790 --> 06:47:18,790
Not even 24 hours ago

5930
06:47:20,650 --> 06:47:22,650
And just dump into like candy land

5931
06:47:23,450 --> 06:47:25,770
It was a little overwhelming at first, but it was all

5932
06:47:26,330 --> 06:47:28,729
After like a couple hours it started to click and it was a lot of fun

5933
06:47:35,240 --> 06:47:47,930
But thank you for audience. It was fun. I would you not like it. It's got candies

5934
06:47:54,069 --> 06:47:55,669
Felt like it fizzled at the end

5935
06:47:55,669 --> 06:47:59,909
Yeah, I mean that that the one I just was kind of getting tired and you get it was kind of very easy to tell

5936
06:48:05,259 --> 06:48:09,900
The good a good like the good four and a half to five hours in the middle there was an absolute blast

5937
06:48:10,619 --> 06:48:13,099
Took me like about an hour or two to understand the game mode

5938
06:48:13,900 --> 06:48:18,459
And really get a click for it. Then we started having a great time and then I got tired

5939
06:48:19,180 --> 06:48:31,459
