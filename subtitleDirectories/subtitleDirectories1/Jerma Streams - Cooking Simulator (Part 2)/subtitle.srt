1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:10,259
Okay, I am back. So we're gonna hang out. I believe... when's the Bethesda

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:22,949
conference? It's in like an hour, right? 4 p.m. Pacific? So in like two hours? Okay.

3
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,019
So I'm gonna play Cooking Simulator. We're gonna pick up right where I left

4
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,719
off in the meantime. And then we're gonna do the Bethesda conference. And

5
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,530
then that's probably... I don't think I'm gonna do Devolver. Because Devolver

6
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,090
every year kind of has... it's not necessarily a live conference, right? It's

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:55,090
kind of like a edited video. They do like a little special thing, right? But

8
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,990
I'll be back tomorrow for Square Enix and... what's the other one? What the hell

9
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:12,579
is they doing? At Ubisoft, right? We'll do that tomorrow as well. Let's get

10
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,579
Cooking Simulator open while we just chill. By the way, remind me when

11
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:21,060
we're like 10 minutes out, because I will forget and I will be late to the

12
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:37,730
conference. Let's get it open. You should see it on the screen. Very shortly. Like

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:52,739
as in right now. Hey, there it is. No one tell him anything. You have to

14
00:01:52,739 --> 00:02:04,340
remind me. I'm not gonna be able to remember. Are we still doing the floor

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:14,300
soup? Yes. Corporate? What do you mean corporate streamer? Which is

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:29,620
soup yard, right? A 12 balance. Which one is it? This one, right? He's not

17
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,120
gonna know. No, I'm paying attention. I got a clock right in front of me.

18
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:52,740
This is loud. Hold on. Loud, loud, loud, loud, loud. There we go. That's better. It's not as

19
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,969
loud now. Okay, so for those of you that have no idea what the hell is going on,

20
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:05,210
you may be just still hanging out here after the Microsoft conference. This

21
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,800
is a soup house. And I got... hold on. There's stuff already going on. Duck broth.

22
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,330
I already got that made, right? Why are there eggs in here? Oh, there's oil in there still.

23
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,780
Why? What's going on? All right, here we go. The duck is right here. I got my

24
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:32,099
duck broth right here. And it's just a few pieces of this, right? All right,

25
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:41,159
that's done. Floor organization. Yeah, I... I pre-made a bunch of this shit. And,

26
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,490
okay, it's... I don't know why it's doing this. I just lost fame for that.

27
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:51,509
That's... I'm reloading. That's bullshit. That's absolutely fucking stupid.

28
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:00,090
How long till Bethesda? Just about two hours. I do not deserve that.

29
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:11,099
Let's try this again. Grab the soup. Grab a few pieces of duck. Okay.

30
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:18,939
Some of the pieces of duck don't stay in. I don't know why. I can't... I don't know why.

31
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:24,569
You get two. Can I put three in here? All right, these are all in here. They're not moving.

32
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:35,189
Go. Oh my fucking god. I can't do anything about it. I can't. I'm gonna lose fame every

33
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:44,730
time. You saw... I tried. I really did. All right, here we go. I need to make a pork chop.

34
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:54,550
Pork rabbit. Do I have one ready? I got one of these ready. What is it? Uh, eight? I don't

35
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:09,750
remember. It's eight. Yeah. Eight chive. Yeah. There's probably a bunch of people that are just

36
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,990
like, what the hell are you doing? Why is everything on the floor? This game...

37
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:23,189
I just like threw it at them. What just happened? What's going on? Did it dump? No,

38
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:39,670
it dumped. It was forward dumping. They didn't patch it. This makes no sense. They

39
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:47,800
did not patch out the floor soup. No way. It's only been like two days. Okay, hold on.

40
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:58,339
I'm gonna start with the pork chops first. Pork chop. Grab one. Get this seasoned up. It is

41
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:11,319
four salt, four pepper. There is four salt. There's already a pork chop out here, but

42
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:22,709
whatever. I can use it later. And then it's time, right? Six time. Yep. If this thing

43
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:31,899
falls off a plate, I'm gonna go play pick-ross. Okay, how much oil? There's plenty of oil. There's

44
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:37,209
plenty of oil in the pan already. Turn it on. Get this cooked up. I already have the potatoes

45
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:44,230
ready. All right, that's going. Uh, potatoes are already done over here. I have my potato

46
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:54,470
section, right? Right here. They're good. And then, okay, now the duck. This should... I don't

47
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:02,139
know why this is not working. They definitely did not patch this. Somebody go look at their

48
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:09,220
notes. If you have food that's been sitting out for more than four days, does it just

49
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:30,620
disappear? Pull it up. Okay, it's still... it's fine. Got it. Finally. See? It's fine. That's

50
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,920
like a four-star meal. Bachelor. I'm gonna flip this in a few seconds. Gaspacho comes in next.

51
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:59,500
No, another duck. Some of these pieces just don't stay in. That's the issue. Okay, this

52
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:09,670
is good too. Yeah, the strategy here is the game doesn't really care that much if your

53
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:18,360
food is four or five days old. Oh, here we go. So I just made a ton of shit in advance.

54
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:41,379
Got it. Okay. Uh, what's next? What was it? Oh, it's fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. That'll

55
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:48,539
be done soon. And I got the plate. I got the, uh, trout. Uh, I want to get this off.

56
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:58,649
There we go. It's a pepper thyme dill. Almost. Pepper thyme dill, pepper thyme dill, dill,

57
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:10,759
dill, dill, dill. Oh shit. That's pepper again. What? How did I just do that? How did I just do

58
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:23,110
that? I don't know how I even just did that. It's because there's two peppers. I think...

59
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:32,090
Where's dill? Dill, dill, dill. I don't think I even have it out. Cayenne. Salt. Where's dill?

60
00:09:32,730 --> 00:10:01,220
Well, I gotta take this out. I need a plate. Come here. All right. Potatoes. Six, right?

61
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:17,620
I need to make more of these. There's nothing bold on it. That's just spices.

62
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:25,059
It's seasoning. All right, now I need to make the trout. I have a little to work fast on this one.

63
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:42,169
Oh, come on. Fine. I don't care. Uh, this is... I don't have any dill. Did I lose the dill?

64
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:58,820
Do I actually have to buy dill again? Did I throw it away? Okay, get this in the oven.

65
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:15,179
Come on. Get in there. No, pick it up. Okay, that's gonna cook. And then I need

66
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:29,830
a lemon. How's that doing? That's doing fine. Where's my knife? I threw it the last time I played

67
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:42,870
somewhere. Sh**. This is not good. Didn't I throw it out the window? I think I threw the knife

68
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:59,850
out the window last time. I have no idea. I gotta buy one though. Okay, um, get that

69
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:12,820
cut into fours. Good. And a plate. Which one's gonna be done first? I gotta flip that. Oh,

70
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:28,519
fuck. where's my spatula? quick quick quick quick quick go go go go cook. are you cooking? thank you.

71
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:38,889
okay get this out. and then what's the little herb that goes on it? parsley? i don't remember.

72
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:57,500
it's uh parsley. eight? six. presentation is lacking but it's okay. that was pretty good.

73
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:11,299
i didn't put horseradish on it. oh well. what i still have to make? what? pork chop. oh tomato

109
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:19,180
and then salt the hell out of it. what if i just put like five duck breasts in here

110
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:31,539
and then have them forever? i'll never have to cook these ever again. i'll get like five.

111
00:21:32,180 --> 00:22:00,039
okay. now move it around a little just so i can. did i just pull the water out? 50 50

112
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,420
milliliters of duck breast. okay. this is good, right? i gotta salt the water too. don't forget

113
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:21,880
that. how much time do i got? plenty. add a loaf of bread. 10? that's enough salt. let's go.

114
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:28,180
these are all cooking. good good good. all right. now we're gonna do gazpacho. do i

115
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,769
remember the gazpacho? i can't even say that fucking word. let's see if i remember it.

116
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:53,670
it was two cucumbers, three tomatoes, a loaf of bread. i forget the rest. is it two bell peppers

117
00:22:53,670 --> 00:23:03,589
or three bell peppers? i think it's three. and that's it, right? or is there an onion?

118
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:14,900
and then one onion. oh no, that's garlic. garlic. that's it. and then i go over here,

119
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:28,220
grind it up. okay. then i add this shit. i think it's 30 of this, right? and then

120
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:50,519
where's the other one? it's like some kind of oil. give me a break. okay. three. this is fucking

121
00:23:50,519 --> 00:24:04,789
dumb. the whole thing wouldn't spill. it's salt, pepper, and then there's an oil? where's my oil?

122
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:25,059
right here. okay. and then 10 salt, 10 pepper. grind it up again. that's dill. oh shit. oh my

123
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:51,740
god. okay. it's done. yeah. right? laugh. everybody laugh. please laugh. please clap. all

124
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:57,059
right. it's done. that's good. it's just sitting there a little overcooked on the onions, but

125
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:09,220
some people like crispy onions. that looks good. don't need more than two. we have 120, 250.

126
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:20,970
that's good. put this down for a minute. i could probably do two more, three more. let's find

127
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:35,940
out. this might be it. can i get one more in here? okay. that's good. that should be

128
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:45,539
enough. almost almost landed perfectly. these are all capped up. all right. now i need to

129
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:52,759
duck broth. how much time? five. i got plenty of time. this is fine. all right. i want to put

130
00:25:52,759 --> 00:26:01,980
the broth over here where it was before. that's tomato. let's get this over here.

131
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:11,450
all right. i need like three or four more plates. plates do not break anymore, right?

132
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:19,130
yeah. i got that upgrade. just get them over there. i gotta be careful though because i will

133
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:35,380
knock over all the tomato soups. one more? okay. let's set them up. oof. that frame rate.

134
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:48,230
i think i'm just gonna cook like five tuna steaks too if i have time.

135
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:58,259
let's get all these out so i can cut them. where's my cutting board? we're gonna skimp the

136
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:04,779
absolute fuck out of this too. i'm gonna have duck breast for like a month. it's gonna be

137
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:24,730
great. the onions doesn't need it. it's fine. i mean the knife. nice and thin. nice and thin.

138
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:49,960
ready? check it. it's so much duck. all right. put the knife down. it's so tender. is this

139
00:27:49,960 --> 00:28:01,619
all gonna fit on here? no. no, it's not. just give me... hold on. let me get another... i need

140
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:15,000
to get another plate. that's not gonna happen. i need a big plate. here we go. that's raw. no,

141
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,099
this is what duck is supposed to look like. you ever had duck before? it looks like this.

142
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:31,670
there's a couple more pieces of duck on the table. it doesn't? yes it does. duck is like

143
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:40,869
green in the middle. it's not. okay. got my duck ready. my broth is ready to be poured

144
00:28:40,869 --> 00:29:00,759
into the bowls. is there an extra duck breast under there? nice. there is. all right. 230.

145
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:17,000
let's see if i can spread this out around 5. 250. 220. 380. it's still a little more. what's

146
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:28,470
when this one needs a little more? let's transfer some of these into here. and then

147
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:37,849
i'm gonna cook up like a bunch of meat too. easy with this. don't fucking drop it. all

148
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:46,740
right. so i got my broth. i got one more breast in here. where is it? let's cut it up.

149
00:29:47,380 --> 00:30:00,470
oops. let's make this one even thinner. i want paper thin slices of duck. i still got a minute left.

150
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:21,289
jeremy, no. wait, why not? you trick your brain into thinking there's more food.

151
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:39,930
this is a really good technique. i'm telling you. did that not even cut? no, it did. okay.

152
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:57,210
that looks pretty good. i would eat this. see, you got two different kinds of duck. you get

153
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,779
like breast meat and like thigh meat. all right. almost time to go. uh what do i need

154
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:15,619
to do before this continues? um okay. i got time in the beginning. 130 bucks. i have a bunch of

155
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:20,710
time in the beginning of this day too. uncooked versus cooked. some people want raw meat.

156
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:35,700
i want more time in the beginning of the day. maybe fame points. let's see. how much is it

157
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,059
for more time during the day? better tips. faster repairs. uh easier. where is it? extended

158
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:48,650
cleaning phase. extended preparation phase. here we go. yeah. that's important. and then

159
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:56,490
i'm gonna do the fame one. more fame points. where is it? where is it? come on. this one right

160
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:05,750
here. all right. shitty fame is still fame. yeah. hey. any publicity is good publicity, right?

161
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:10,230

162
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,640

219
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:57,000
pepper? what? did i fuck up the broth? i didn't fuck up the broth, did i? all right. speaking of

220
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,030
broth. here. because look. this is. this has been sitting here for like at least two weeks.

221
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:16,500
this is going to be fine. see? i must have screwed the recipe up. espachio with uh.

222
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:32,170
there's already one end here sitting on the edge. all right. these are good.

223
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:41,099
what's next? i gotta pick up these potatoes. uh. it's gonna be salmon, i guess. i'm guessing.

224
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:50,070
no. another duck. but this is not right. this is not seasoned correctly. i have so much of it too.

225
00:49:50,949 --> 00:50:03,219
too much duck. maybe give them only two pieces. let me see. it's gotta be something i messed up

226
00:50:03,219 --> 00:50:09,239
in the seasoning. yep. i fucked up the broth. i'm gonna have to remake the broth. god damn

227
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,760
it. yeah. not enough pepper. too much duck? not enough salt. well i'm gonna salt it in

228
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,539
pepper before i give it to them. yeah. that didn't do the broth right. uh. it's all good.

229
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:39,340
tomato soup. i got that over here. all right. that's good. oh. it's because i put

230
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:50,119
way too much duck in the broth. all right. that sucks. i'll make this one perfect.

231
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:57,590
pepper time dill. i'm gonna do it perfect. i can't rinse it off. okay. did i? pepper. not salt.

232
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:33,059
pepper time dill. time dill. pepper time dill. this is dill, right? yeah. and then horse

233
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:56,019
riders, when it comes out, go in. clown cooking. all right. i need a big bowl for

234
00:52:56,019 --> 00:53:18,489
this. a big plate. thank god. what? the water? hey, i got plenty of potatoes. these look actually

235
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:27,269
pretty good. they look like kind of yummy chips. they actually do look kind of good.

236
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:37,190
let's stick these over here out of the way. nice. nice like flavor explosion.

237
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:53,139
what the hell? all right. i need duck. it's gonna be fucked up, but whatever.

238
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,289
too much duck. i'm gonna go one piece. this is all fucked. doesn't matter.

239
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:11,219
i'll fix it for tomorrow. at least if i don't lose points, it's fine. it's a net zero.

240
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:21,480
horseradish. and then what is it? what else do you need? a lemon into quarters, right?

241
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:32,010
hey, our special of the day is salmon. oh, just kidding. it's actually duck five times.

242
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:37,139
this is the third or fourth time it's been duck. there's only been one salmon.

243
00:54:37,780 --> 00:55:04,420
okay. new plate. horseradish. trout's not burning. it's good. i need a horseradish

244
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:24,730
right here. nice. lemons on there. get this one perfect. and then it's parsley. six. this

245
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:31,420
one will be good. this should be at least five stars. four or five stars. that's perfect.

246
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:49,820
yeah. there we go. i'm bringing it back. is something still cooking? the oven is just on.

247
00:55:49,820 --> 00:56:10,630
there you go. not bad. duck broth again. we're going for not losing points on the

248
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:16,789
duck broth. i'm gonna season it. salt and pepper, right? let me get this out quickly.

249
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:45,400
perfect. so what was wrong with the duck? do i need more salt? is it salt or pepper?

250
00:56:45,400 --> 00:57:07,139
and where's the salt? that looks like a mess. salt. i need like a salt in every corner of the

251
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:20,150
room. okay. i seasoned it up. let's put some duck on here. and hopefully we can at least

252
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:34,019
get three stars. net zero. thank god. still under seasoned? too much pepper and too much salt.

253
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:41,590
so i needed to dilute it with water. i'm here. it was too much. all right. i need another trout.

254
00:57:42,150 --> 00:58:27,289
okay. here we go. duck. too much salt and too much pepper. let's see if diluting helps.

255
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:44,469
yep. yeah, it does. now there's not enough pepper. bake trout. i can do the trout. i'm

256
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:49,139
gonna make this one perfect again because i'll get more fame points. and what do you know?

267
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:29,190
it's fine. it's just barely hanging on the edges. actually, presentation-wise, it looks

268
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:54,949
pretty good. parsley, right? why? where'd the fish go? where's the fish? where did it go?

269
01:02:54,949 --> 01:03:02,579
it fell into the ground. i don't see it anywhere. okay. well, that's fantastic. great. i'm glad. um,

270
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:43,980
okay. what just came in? come on! hurry up! go go go go go go go go!

271
01:03:43,980 --> 01:04:10,539
come on! 30 seconds! 20 seconds! it's almost done! i had to get it out. it was still

272
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:17,349
fine. not gonna lose points. all right. we got the pork chop. that's it. we just need the

273
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:24,840
potatoes. we just need the cooked chip potatoes. i don't have any of those. we'll just use these.

274
01:04:27,559 --> 01:05:08,900
plate. that's way too many. i gotta take some off. done. it was the potatoes. sorry,

275
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:22,519
i'm not gonna lose any points. that's it, right? anymore? i'll clean up. i'll make this one

276
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:28,869
perfect. i have to. and i mean, like, the best i could possibly do. i don't have another one

277
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:35,179
that was made. all right, hold on. salt, pepper. let's get them both out here. these two

278
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:42,710
are gonna be good. they're both just salt and pepper. this one... i already got the boiled

279
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:48,780
potatoes. this one is not... it's not clean, but it's okay. speaking of clean... is this clean?

280
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:09,300
10 in here. a little too much oil, but it's fine. all right, so now i'm gonna get these

281
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:22,940
going. salt and pepper on both. is it five on both or is it four on both? five on this one.

282
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:33,130
five on both. come on, i did it five times. why do you do that? i clearly just clicked

283
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:53,110
on it. salt. and this goes on the grill. this goes on the pan. all right, let's go.

284
01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:04,739
bang. get it on. all right, now i need to do... i got the potatoes. this one's already done.

285
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:29,019
and then i need to lemon into slices. four slices. flip it. yeah, yeah, yeah. where's

286
01:07:29,019 --> 01:07:55,219
my spatula? how's this going? pretty good. make lemon fries. that would actually probably

287
01:07:55,219 --> 01:08:21,460
be kind of good. almost time to flip. and flip it. same deal over here. uh,

288
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:33,220
not quite. i definitely... i have to flip it again, though. take a look at that char. i know

289
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:47,189
it's a beautiful char. and this beautiful bird shit all over this grill. i'm gonna flip it.

290
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:55,130
okay, good. let it cook the rest. this one's almost going to take off. put on a plate,

291
01:08:55,130 --> 01:09:02,470
almost. let's get this down. and i needed... what do you need with this? just two potatoes

292
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:21,109
for that one. and then this one needs the lemon slices and oregano. you got it. almost,

293
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:41,779
almost. go, go, go, go, go. bethesda is starting? no, it's not starting. i keep looking over here

294
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:50,119
and i see... bethesda, hurry! starting in five minutes. done. okay, this is just lemon slices.

295
01:09:50,119 --> 01:10:21,699
lemon slices and then oregano. how many? eight. that should be the end of the day.

296
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:26,659
that's perfect. that's a lot of points. good. how does a full five star not have more points?

297
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:34,869
all right, i think we're probably gonna get a new recipe here. is salmon steak hanging

298
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:45,220
out? whatever. throw it away. all right, i need to do some cleaning. just put everything in the

299
01:10:45,220 --> 01:11:06,100
sink. is this clean? this is not clean. let's get that set. turn off the stove. this is clean.

300
01:11:06,899 --> 01:11:16,789
this is fine. there's a salmon just still in there. all right, let's get the repair man.

301
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:20,729
all these potatoes, are they cooked? no. put them back. can i put them back?

302
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:48,090
so much junk. i gotta get the bucket. clean up the floor. all right, that's in.

303
01:11:49,430 --> 01:12:00,100
it's out. it's in. carrot on the ground. send this for food. that's not gonna work.

304
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:09,130
there's nothing to send. okay, i can clean that up. put it back up there. nothing in the ground

305
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:20,010
over here. there's a couple of these things. and that should be good. a little bit over here.

306
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:36,340
all right, dump it. set this back up. oh, i would throw these away, but i don't want to.

307
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:41,060
yeah, i will. it's a fucking mess over here. it's an absolute mess.

308
01:12:55,289 --> 01:13:06,789
what is happening with this? why does it keep doing this? how much time? 20. i'm gonna stick

309
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:15,479
this down. and the person beeping the horn is gonna drive me insane. let's wash the counter.

310
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:27,989
put the horseradish over here. see, i'm cleaning. you guys think i'm not gonna clean?

311
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:34,810
i'm gonna have to get a repair man in here. because this is all messed up. this looks like

312
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:53,930
crap. i can't believe Todd Howard just announced Rat Movie 3. that would be interesting.

313
01:13:54,649 --> 01:14:07,859
that would be really strange. i'm gonna put this away in the mop. watch out for the floor.

314
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:28,779
no more spills, right? nope. okay, now i need repair. i'm gonna fix all this bullshit in here.

315
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:49,430
need a new fridge? fix that. just fix everything. fix this. fix this. fix the

316
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:56,060
fryer later. fix the stove. anything else need to be repaired? i don't think so. what about

317
01:14:56,060 --> 01:15:10,939
the counter? i can't fix the counter? yeah, i can. fix the counter. money well spent. how much time

318
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:21,800
do i have? all right, so i have to... i need to make some shit. i gotta make some stuff. let's

319
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:36,810
move this cayenne pepper back over here. i need a little spice rack. how am i doing on soups?

320
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:46,819
i need to make another gazpacho? no, this looks like enough. three, three. i need to make

321
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:51,579
what? yeah, i got plenty of tomato. i gotta make some duck. this is all junk, i think.

322
01:15:52,300 --> 01:16:17,029
it's just not made right. this is junk. unfortunately, i had to do that. when is

323
01:16:17,029 --> 01:16:25,909
the bethesda conference? it is in, i think, like 30 minutes? 40 minutes? let me check.

324
01:16:25,909 --> 01:16:31,979
what just happened? what just happened? what's going on? what the hell just happened?

325
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:47,590
uh, well, that's great. it's been 90 minutes. yeah, so we got plenty of time. uh, that

326
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:55,590
just broke this raspberry juice. i need to just get rid of this, because this is just

327
01:16:55,750 --> 01:17:22,630
every time i put this down, it just causes a problem. i have to carry this around with me.

328
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:28,460
okay, good. well, now i have more shit to clean up. that's great. i'm gonna make a

329
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:39,909
gazpacho. no, duck. let's try this again. 1.3, and then what? 12 salt, 12 pepper,

330
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:50,439
and two ducks. that's what the recipe was last time. so i'll season this up.

331
01:17:52,140 --> 01:18:01,420
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. it's 12 and 12,

332
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:11,340
i think. or maybe 10, but it's okay if it's a little bit over. again, i'm missing the salt. again.

333
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,810
yet again, i have no idea where the salt is. i'm just gonna buy five of them and put them in

334
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:33,539
every corner. i don't care. they're two cents. i'm gonna do the same thing with pepper.

335
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:54,460
there'll always be one, no matter where i am. there we go. okay. let me clean this up. my

336
01:18:54,460 --> 01:19:17,989
bucket. still standing. that was weird. the bucket. potato rack. no, i need this over here.

337
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:34,359
give me the sponge. this is gonna give me, like, anxiety. i can't have that. i can't have, like,

338
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:53,130
blueberry juice all over the place. okay. up, down. i need another bottle of vinegar,

339
01:19:53,130 --> 01:20:07,590
right? and then i can make the duck and we can get going. spatula, bring it back. all right.

340
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:12,199
this is looking a little better. is my salt and pepper? always put them right next to each

341
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:29,369
other. clean, clean, clean. why is there a blend in here? are we good? i think that's it.

342
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:34,729
now i'm gonna make the broth for the duck. one carrot, one onion. i've already salted and

343
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:52,760
peppered this, haven't i? i have not. are you sure? damn it. it's all right. no, i did. i did.

344
01:20:52,760 --> 01:21:13,529
i did. didn't i do this? didn't i put pepper in there? do i need pepper in there? does pepper...

345
01:21:13,529 --> 01:21:36,600
no pepper. okay, duck. it's two duck breasts. and that's it. and you start it up. yeah,

346
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:55,750
that'll be fine. Todd Howard is watching you play this on stage. can you imagine? didn't

347
01:21:55,750 --> 01:22:04,250
level up. all right. is the critic gonna come today so i can finally do this? we got to fame

348
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:08,600
three and then it was immediately ripped from us. grilled tuna steak is the dish of the day.

349
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:23,460
you got it. it needs to simmer overnight. all right. tuna steak. let's get them out. salt them

350
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:56,630
up. okay. salt and pepper on every location. good. it's five and five. what's that? good.

351
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:21,220
good. good. put it on the ground. it hits... don't worry. it'll hit the ground. there's

352
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:24,180
plenty of time for this tuna steak to hit the ground. at least half of these will. two

353
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:33,060
out of the four will be on the ground. Todd Howard just said the new elder scrolls map is at least

354
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:38,100
five. at least five times as least... what are you saying? at least five as big as me? five

355
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:57,689
germas? shit. i just let this sit here like that. all right. hold on. fucking ruined it,

356
01:23:57,689 --> 01:24:21,000
i think. how cooked is it? is it overcooked? it looks all right. you're wasting more duck.

357
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,079
no, i'm not. it's fine. let's get four or five plates over there and i can start the day.

358
01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:53,430
i gotta get my tuna steaks ready. last one. i got my broth. just set them up in a row

359
01:24:53,430 --> 01:25:07,899
here. we'll be good to go. we need more detail. all right. let's start pouring it. here we go.

360
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:20,090
the onion's a little burnt, but i don't think it'll be too much of a problem. be 25. 230.

361
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:33,720
as long as it's over 220. that's good. 290. that's a little over. 270. i can spread this

362
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:50,090
out a little bit more. that's good. all right. good. duck is cut. give me a plate. how much

363
01:25:50,090 --> 01:26:01,909
time? five minutes. i can prepare the tuna steaks as well. slow and steady. don't explode.

364
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:06,539
all right. tuna steaks. these have all been salted. now i have to just grill them up.

365
01:26:06,539 --> 01:26:19,800
i'm gonna put them all on at the same time. now give me a plate. transfer them all. what did

366
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:28,460
i tell you? this is at least one. well that one was dropped a double. we have one out of

367
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:44,630
four. i hit the gun twice. does that count? that's good. now i need lemons, right? lemons

368
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:55,529
into squares. four slices on each lemon. i need four lemons. get them on the cutting board.

369
01:26:59,029 --> 01:27:14,579
excellent. four into fours. now i gotta move this shit out of the way. i can't do that.

370
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:32,970
there we go. these have to be good. they do. i should be able to get these. four.

371
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:42,779
what are you doing to me? oh whatever. that one's a little jacked up but it's fine.

372
01:27:43,420 --> 01:28:16,890
all right. lemons are done. steaks. oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! saved. nice. is this cooking?

373
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:25,819
yes. all right. i also need how much... what do i need? parsley. i actually forget what it is,

374
01:28:25,819 --> 01:28:31,739
but okay. now that we're almost done with that, i'm gonna get... my broth is already done. my

375
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:37,079
tomato soup. i have gazpacho. i have borscht. i think i'm gonna get a couple of these out,

376
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:46,890
too. there's always a herring. always. season these up. i don't remember what it is. it's...

377
01:28:47,210 --> 01:29:09,880
um... give me a big plate. pepper, thyme, and dill. okay. p-t-d. pepper, thyme, dill.

378
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:19,050
well, i think it's gonna be perfect. tawd is beating up somebody in the audience. so

379
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:34,340
okay. sure he is. that one's not done. well, the edge of that needs to be cooked a little

380
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:43,510
more. okay. let's put this down. all right. now in the meantime, pepper, thyme, dill.

01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:27,130
pepper, thyme, dill. okay. pepper, thyme, thyme. it's done. done. steaks are ready. now i just need

385
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:32,649

386
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:40,470
a twitch chat and just sits there and goes, this is really strange. do you think he knows

387
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:48,409
what everybody says? you don't think... maybe he just doesn't do social media. it doesn't look

388
01:31:48,409 --> 01:32:12,550
at all when these come out horse radish. i need two of these. get it done. i can't even

389
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:19,989
imagine what it would be like to be like tawd howard. sometimes i open up my twitter

390
01:32:20,069 --> 01:32:26,359
and like somebody will like draw a picture of me with like spit coming out of my nose and like

391
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:46,220

what was so wrong with that? what was wrong with that? it was perfect. you didn't cut...

397

411
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:43,909
online, and they're reducing the price of like all in-game purchases in blades by like 8%.

412
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:52,310

413
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:56,710
and it's gonna be like the elder scroll 6 on it. it's gonna be like blood. he's

415
01:37:23,609 --> 01:37:30,100
is it weird? i kind of hope that he does. no, never mind. i was gonna just say something

416
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:40,199
stupid. he comes out and does like the pendover gym carry thing where he like talks with his

417
01:37:40,199 --> 01:38:00,840
butt. all right, is the duck worth it? i think this is good. we remade the duck. nice. okay,

418
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:10,859

419
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:20,710
that ready to go, so we're gonna have to make it. turn the grill on. salt and pepper.

420
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:40,199
get it on there quick. good. all right. oh, i still have the potatoes, but they're junk.

421
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:45,880
these are so junky. hold on. let me see if i can cut these into fries and then salt them.

422
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:54,920
give me a plate. if i can at least make these look nice, then it should be fine.

423
01:38:55,560 --> 01:39:02,840
let's go with this. how many should i get? like four or five of them? cut them into little

424
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:22,470
fries and then salt them up. this should be good. okay, give me the... wait, turn this

425
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:56,920
in the knife. i cut these into fries. is that not doing anything? why? all right,

426
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:27,449
why did that work and the other one didn't? oh, who cares? why can't i cut these? they're

427
01:40:27,449 --> 01:40:57,319
not salted. i got it. i got it. i got it. i got it. enjoy. good enough. you guys have lost your

436
01:42:52,789 --> 01:42:59,609
either. i can't wait to see. i wonder what they're gonna do. oh, fuck you, game. that's

437
01:42:59,609 --> 01:43:30,439
such bullshit. that's gonna bring me down. oh my god. can just get this off the fucking table?

438
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:44,840
what the fuck? i wasted two perfectly good soups. give me a break. why? those are perfectly fine.

01:43:44,840 --> 01:44:01,479
what's the last thing? one more duck. i have another gazpacho, don't i? yeah, i do.

441
01:44:18,119 --> 01:44:38,699
i already got it right here. i'm low on soups. another steak dinner. no tuna. it's gazpacho.

442
01:44:40,600 --> 01:45:01,800
i like saying gazpacho. finally, a tuna. i just hear gas. that's not a good sign. one, two,

443
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:12,420
three, four, and then it is oregano. give me a perfect score on this one, please. i'll take

444
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:29,880
it. i love how rowdy everybody is right now over this e3 tod conference. i would have had

445
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:36,460
it too. that sucks. this sucks. i have to make that from scratch now. let me just do the steak

446
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:55,319
quickly. salt, pepper, get on the grill. i think people are more excited for tod howard to just

447
01:45:55,319 --> 01:46:04,229
walk on the stage than they are about the games he may or may not be announcing. okay,

448
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:25,369
the french fries. let's just dump these for a second. potatoes on this. why are they all

449
01:46:25,369 --> 01:46:42,680
falling off the plate? flip, salt. i actually kind of want to eat those. one, two, three, go.

450
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:52,710
okay, everything's good. this is what it is. this just burns on. all right, now i need to

451
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:58,890
make a... i need to make the borscht. onion, carrot, parsley, beetroot. i forget what it's

452
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:15,779
like. how many is it? i haven't made it in so long. it's chicken broth. 1,700. how's

453
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:23,819
this looking? almost done. and then it's salt, right? let me look at the recipe. 20 grams,

454
01:47:23,819 --> 01:47:45,029
20 grams. oh yeah, i forgot. it's like ridiculously seasoned. the screen fell.

455
01:47:45,989 --> 01:47:50,260
yeah. are you guys really trying to tell me that the titantron fell down?

456
01:47:51,819 --> 01:48:10,180
thank god i have one more of those. but i'm gonna make this first. looks good. 20 grams.

457
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:17,479
this is so salt-intensive. people actually eat this? this is like a thousand milligrams

458
01:48:17,479 --> 01:48:25,699
of salt per serving. it's like drinking salt. no, now i need... i swear to god. get the

459
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:38,300
fuck away from me. just get them away. they're like magnetic. god damn it. am i cooking

460
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:45,380

461
01:48:45,380 --> 01:49:17,270
shit. what a pain in the ass. salt, pepper, again. do it again. where's the salt? i just

462
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:43,029
had it. all right. this is parsley, carrot, five beets, and an onion. i think that's it.

463
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:52,489
cook it. go. what else do i need to get? uh, gazpacho. i already hear it. it's right there.

i got an idea. it's already ready. new order of what? tomato soup? i'm so excited.

466
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:53,720
too many lemons? now that's the right amount of lemons. see? making some good money.

467

471
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:16,500
careful with this. duck broth. right here. that's the last one. hopefully nobody else orders it.

472
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:40,090
and hopefully that goes through. and i got the last tuna. hopefully... wait. where's the last

473
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:50,520
tuna? oh, come on. it's another duck. i still have just a full herring that nobody ordered.

474
01:52:53,590 --> 01:53:05,960
i'm gonna pee my pants. i'm gonna piss really bad. i gotta make sure i pee before the

475
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:20,279
conference. what do we team on is what? duck. i guess i can just make it right now. i need

476
01:53:22,569 --> 01:53:53,859
well, shit. you got it. um, i need ten ten and then one carrot, one onion. e3 countdown on the

477
01:53:53,859 --> 01:54:08,199
screen. let's get it on the screen. no. i don't care. no. i care about e3. i just don't care

478
01:54:08,199 --> 01:54:15,539
about the countdown to e3. i know it's gonna happen. that's one more extra pepper. that's

479
01:54:15,539 --> 01:54:26,229
fine. all right. now i need parsley and a carrot. right? no. carrot and onion. and then

480
01:54:26,229 --> 01:54:35,130
put the two duck breasts in here as well. and then grind it up. we good. i need two

481
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:43,449
of these. that's it. what the hell? what the hell happened over here? skipping

482
01:54:45,750 --> 01:55:10,199
interconnecting words now. is this on? these are clean. yeah. give them up. what's been your

483
01:55:10,199 --> 01:55:17,510
guy's favorite part about e3 so far? and i need full paragraphs. if what you write is less

484
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:38,649
than four sentences, you're getting banned from the channel. Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd

485
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:55,819
Todd. at least i can use these. anybody a Todd fan here? oh, i don't think so. i think you're

486
01:55:55,819 --> 01:56:18,619
in short company there. all right. get that onion in. is one of these duck breasts not cooking?

487
01:56:18,619 --> 01:56:26,260
no. get the onion out. no reason to have it in. the Keanu Reeves is probably my favorite part

488
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:29,779
of all the things they showed at e3 this year. when he came out on stage

489
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:34,180
and made the references to the game that i liked, i thought it was really fun. see,

490
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:37,859
i did a paragraph. i pretty much only needed to have like two or three words there,

491
01:56:37,859 --> 01:56:40,420
but i told you you're going to get banned if you don't do at least four sentences.

492
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:53,619
i'm not going to get banned. you might. someone will. okay, take this out. i just need to do

493
01:56:53,619 --> 01:57:18,060
the broth. get the duck breasts out. cut. serve. i've really been feeling indifferent

494
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:21,340
about e3 so far. i'm not really a microsoft fan, so the entire show just went past me.

495
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:24,380
yesterday i only saw the soccer football conference for the fifa game, and that was

496
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:46,699
the kind of awful not gonna lie. all right, let's broth it up. Todd comes out in a

497
01:57:46,699 --> 01:58:04,699
terminator costume. they making a new terminator game? i'd fucking play it.

498
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:20,899
i wonder if they're still gonna be, whatever the game is, still gonna be using the telltale

499
01:58:20,899 --> 01:58:38,149
engine from like 2007. we'll find out soon enough. all right, it's time. it's time to,

500
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:43,210
the critic is coming today. i gotta get everything ready to go. whatever the critic wants,

501
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:53,079
i gotta make fresh. i do have some bowls to put out. i got duck here because we're at

502
01:58:53,079 --> 01:59:00,260
fame level three. i have a full halibut ready. i've got my potato crisps. let me get some

503
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:11,180
bowls out because i need the broth. i'm ready for the critic. need it. gazpacho. i gotta make a

504
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:19,529
lot of shit here, don't i? yeah, the boar should be fine. i can probably fit it into three or

505
01:59:19,529 --> 01:59:32,840
four plates, and then i need to make some gazpacho. gazpacho, gazpacho, gazpacho. every

506
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:37,829
time i say gazpacho, some of you guys have like your veins pop out of your forehead.

507
01:59:41,289 --> 01:59:52,229
calm down. it's okay. just relax. it's not worth getting upset over. like, when people call me,

508
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:56,630
like, okay, for instance, my streamer persona video game online media name

509
01:59:57,270 --> 02:00:06,680
is jerma. jerma985, right? don't forget it either. i get called sometimes jerma. oh hey,

510
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:25,020
jerma! jerma! it's all right. what am i gonna, that's fine. it's too much in that one.

511
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:26,460
people have different ways to pronounce things.

512
02:00:30,039 --> 02:00:32,520
i know some people are freaking out about pouring with the handle.

513
02:00:33,239 --> 02:00:37,319
don't worry. it's all right. it's, you can call me jerma. you can call me jerma.

514
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:59,380
call me joe. all right, i need a bunch of, i need a bunch of the g one. i need to make a

515
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:14,899
little bit more jerma. that's good enough. take this out. hopefully there's not more than

516
02:01:14,899 --> 02:01:25,079
two borsts tomorrow. hopefully the critic doesn't want it. just remake the soup,

517
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:32,069
again, with the same pot. i need more chicken stock if that's gonna, let's just see if it works.

518
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:51,689
these are all empty. why am i still holding on to these? isn't this how grandmothers usually make

519
02:01:51,689 --> 02:01:57,560
the food? they use the same thing over and over again. no, that's still good. it's still

520
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:07,220
delicious. no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't need to go to the grocery store. grandma,

521
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:14,939
the beets are green. extra flavor. people eat cheese, you eat cheese. that's gotten mold on

522
02:02:14,939 --> 02:02:36,869
it. i mean, it's hitting, it's hitting all the onions and shit. are you happy,

523
02:02:36,869 --> 02:02:42,489
you're happy you had the onions? are you glad you had the onions? are you happy you had the onions?

524
02:02:42,489 --> 02:02:59,979
huh? are you glad you had the onions? all right, we still got time. anybody knows that that's a

525
02:02:59,979 --> 02:03:05,850
reference to. you get 600 fucking million dollars from my pretend monopoly bank account

526
02:03:05,850 --> 02:03:25,430
that i pretend to send to you through telepathic means as a joke. am i gonna say it? nobody

527
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:37,619
knows that. i don't think anybody knows. no, it's not from family guy. there's 6100 people

528
02:03:37,619 --> 02:03:48,520
here. not one person knows this. it's not the simpsons. i'm not saying it again. well,

02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:41,020
i'm walking around like an idiot. that's some curb your enthusiasm. yep, you got, hold on.

535
02:04:43,050 --> 02:05:13,770
there you go. spend it wisely. and did i get it? didn't go in? 30 and 30, right? yes.

536
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:24,170
and then what is this? all right, there's supposed to be salt and pepper at every station.

537
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:50,279
there is. shit, i thought i didn't get it. come on, get in there. what? whatever. you

538
02:05:50,279 --> 02:05:56,659
gotta get a new joke to pass the time. i'm not like a joke factory, guys. what do you

539
02:05:56,659 --> 02:06:15,449
want me to say? i'm not like, i can't just produce. just turn the webcam on. no, i can't,

540
02:06:15,449 --> 02:06:19,449
i can't just produce under fucking circumstance. i got, i've got, it's just gotta be natural.

541
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:37,159
you want to turn the fucking webcam on and start dancing? why would i ever do that?

542
02:06:37,159 --> 02:06:54,890
what do you think i am? a vessel. ah, maybe, maybe in your, like,

543
02:06:54,890 --> 02:07:18,550
fucking fan fiction. this is all burnt completely. that was loud. all right, so

544
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:23,479
i think i'm pretty much ready for the day. i got that. i'm gonna make up some,

545
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:31,529
what's the meal of the day? see, i dumped the hot soup all over me. don't, isn't that,

546
02:07:31,529 --> 02:07:49,399
isn't that like a 10 out of 10 hysterical piece of human comedy? give me the bucket.

547
02:07:49,399 --> 02:07:52,890
here comes the critic. i'm gonna impress the critic. and then at that point,

548
02:07:52,890 --> 02:07:58,890
it's gonna be time for the bethesda electronic conference. we'll see what the fuck they

549
02:07:58,890 --> 02:08:13,909
introduce. i'm so looking forward to it. my whole life has been leading up to this moment

550
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:20,710
when i get to see todd howard come out on stage, clap and go,

551
02:08:21,590 --> 02:08:30,199
i can't wait. it's gonna happen. this first thing is gonna do. all right, i think i'm ready to go.

552
02:08:35,829 --> 02:08:41,640
i am. whatever. i'm not gonna make the meat beforehand because if he wants meat,

553
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:46,470
it has to be fresh. i can't just give the critic the crap from the freezer.

554
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:57,699
all right, here we go. this is it. more exciting than e3. that was 916 dollars.

555
02:08:57,699 --> 02:09:09,130
is that more than i've ever had? i've never received that kind of paycheck right here.

556
02:09:09,770 --> 02:09:18,390
all right, we got some skills. all right, cheaper products, liquids, fame boost.

557
02:09:19,189 --> 02:09:25,449
is it like a one where critics are less critical? taste tolerance is already up.

558
02:09:28,439 --> 02:09:31,960
derpers and gourmets have their expectations lowered. is there a derper?

559
02:09:35,539 --> 02:09:38,899
oh, i was gonna explain a dream. you're right. yep, yep, yep. i was gonna talk about a dream.

560
02:09:38,899 --> 02:09:42,739
so i don't know how many of you other guys do this or not, but sometimes this happens to

561
02:09:42,739 --> 02:09:48,020
me, and it happened like over the course of a few nights. so a few nights ago, i had a dream

562
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:58,300
that i broke my brother's golf clubs. i don't know why. i had a dream that i was golfing,

563
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:01,260
and i snapped the head off. i was trying to drive too hard, and i was really embarrassed,

564
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:05,500
and i was really scared about it. i was like, holy shit, this is bad. i just broke my

565
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:10,779
brother's fucking driver. it was like a golf club or something. so i broke it, and then i

566
02:10:10,779 --> 02:10:16,699
woke up. and i thought that it was real, and after like two or three hours, it wasn't

567
02:10:16,699 --> 02:10:19,979
really that real anymore. i was like, oh, whatever, that's weird. did that happen? did

568
02:10:19,979 --> 02:10:26,470
it not happen? whatever, and i forgot about it. but like two days later, i had another

569
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:32,279
dream where i replaced the golf clubs. and it was so... like i went to the store and

570
02:10:32,279 --> 02:10:39,060
i bought golf clubs, and i brought them back, and i gave them to my brother. so i woke up,

571
02:10:39,859 --> 02:10:46,840
and i'm not kidding, i thought that i did a perfect like dream loop where i honestly,

572
02:10:46,840 --> 02:10:53,609
to goodness still, even to this day, think it may even be real. like a day later. it was so real

573
02:10:53,609 --> 02:10:58,090
that i broke the clubs, replaced them over two days, and i was going to text him, be like,

574
02:10:58,090 --> 02:11:02,680
hey, like i replaced your golf clubs. i just want to like... you got them, right? i don't

575
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:11,899
know why my brain was going to text him that like this morning. you guys ever have like a

576
02:11:11,899 --> 02:11:16,539
complete loop where you finish a complete story arc in your brain, and you thought it was

577
02:11:16,539 --> 02:11:26,069
real over the course of a couple days? that may not have even been a dream. okay, here we

578
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:39,880
go. i definitely want that. you're just insane. you're just a freak. at least i replaced them.

579
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:50,420
let's go with less spices. all right, this is it. i fucked this up last time. bad.

580
02:11:55,479 --> 02:12:03,579
you don't have a brother. espachos de... okay, this is... i gotta be ready. those of you that

581
02:12:03,579 --> 02:12:08,699
don't know this game, if you don't give the critic at least a four star dish, he removes

582
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:12,140
almost 150 points from your score, and it takes like two hours to come back.

583
02:12:12,859 --> 02:12:31,579
it's really bad. but i don't even play golf. i don't even do that. i don't play golf at all, ever.

584
02:12:31,579 --> 02:12:40,810
all right, let's get right to it. i don't even need to prepare. let's go. of course,

585
02:12:40,810 --> 02:12:43,130
it's pork chops. the thing... one thing that i don't have ready to be made,

586
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:50,119
but this is not the critic, so i don't really care that much about it. this is what? pepper

587
02:12:50,119 --> 02:13:10,569
p t d, right? salt, pepper, and thyme. no. it's s b t. four four s b t. thyme. where is it?

588
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:23,859
that's... why is it not on my station? you all right? come on. what? what do you... what do you...

589
02:13:23,859 --> 02:13:30,119
i just clearly did it. i clearly just put it on there. you gotta be kidding me. all right, 30.

590
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:41,380
these take a long time to get it in there. and then i also have the potatoes, right? yeah,

591
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:59,300
they're already over here. just gotta wait for that to cook. just stare at it. i got

592
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:09,260
one customer in the store. all right, whatever it is, i'm making it fresh for the critic.

593
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:28,149
oh shit, they have to be baked. they gotta be baked. just chunked up the potatoes. that's 11.

594
02:14:28,149 --> 02:14:38,579
i keep making that mistake. i swear to god. it's all right. all right, chunk them up into

595
02:14:39,220 --> 02:15:06,380
50 gram slices. i lose this knife every single day. is it on the ground? i can't cut it on

596
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:50,390
here. get out of the way! it's not the critic, i don't care. that technique's not

597
02:15:50,390 --> 02:16:05,670
going to work here. good. all right. salt. e3? e3? e3? what do you mean e3? e3? in 30 minutes.

598
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:21,560
it's not right now. it's in 30 minutes. i'm not missing it. no, you guys, it's not even time.

599
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:42,329
the pre-show? why do i want to watch the pre-show? i am the pre-show! he's not wrong.

600
02:16:44,100 --> 02:16:49,000
hey, what just happened to the view count? the view count just went to zero.

601
02:16:50,520 --> 02:17:00,069
oh no, nobody's watching anymore. nobody's here. they all left. everybody wanted to go see the

602
02:17:00,069 --> 02:17:19,930
pre-show. zero viewers. well, shit. hey, they all came back. did you? but how was the pre-show? is

603
02:17:19,930 --> 02:17:31,219
it any good? i knew you'd come back. i knew you were gonna come back to this channel. come on.

604
02:17:31,219 --> 02:17:54,600
i can't serve it on this. what am i doing? i gotta salt these. excuse me. yeah, we've

605
02:17:54,600 --> 02:18:01,139
already talked about our e3 impressions. what more would you like me to say? what do i think

606
02:18:01,139 --> 02:18:04,500
is going to happen at bethesda? you want me to give you my insider information that i don't have?

607
02:18:05,059 --> 02:18:12,969
we've got to pay extra for the pre-show. you don't have to pay anything for the pre-show.

608
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:24,569
i would be happy if we got a game that had magic in it. like, with a wand. that's really

609
02:18:24,569 --> 02:18:35,209
it. is this the critic? no. make sure you start screaming when it's time, because i will

610
02:18:35,209 --> 02:18:41,079
forget. and i'm going to be late to the conference. all right, this is salmon. yeah,

611
02:18:41,079 --> 02:18:57,850
i got potatoes already done. what's the big thing this year besides the xbox alexa?

612
02:18:57,850 --> 02:19:15,420

613
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:23,579
but we've already seen them. is there anything new that we've never seen before? starfield. oh

614
02:19:23,579 --> 02:19:42,040
yeah, they're making a starfield. i completely forgot about that. i wonder if they're going

615
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:53,190
to show any gameplay. you just activated my alexa? oh, i'm sorry. i forgot. i'm on

617
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:07,899

619
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:52,659

620
02:20:53,299 --> 02:20:59,000
he doesn't seem like the kind of guy that can do like aerials and backflips.

621
02:20:59,799 --> 02:21:07,450
i don't know why i see him on a trapeze. he comes out in one of those like circus

622
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:19,239
onesies. he's like the kind of like trapeze kind of guys i think. he's a nerd. you can be a nerd

623
02:21:19,239 --> 02:21:38,069
and still use a trapeze. i'm not sure what was so bad about that. potatoes? all right, here we go.

624
02:21:38,069 --> 02:21:42,469
food critics ordering. this is a big deal. i can't screw this up. whatever it is, i'm making it

633
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:53,540
right, in the time that i've just been being a dickhead, i could have just done this normally

634
02:25:53,540 --> 02:26:11,159
and done it correctly and had a normal amount of stars. i can't put this in. just finish it

635
