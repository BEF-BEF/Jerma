00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,929
Hey what's going on everybody, Jerma here with the first ever episode of Enlighten.

2
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:12,089
That's the title I'm gonna be using I guess. Enlighten is a series I'm doing where I go back in time

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,289
and I pick a title that was overlooked by a lot of people or didn't really sell that well but it was

4
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:22,739
still a fantastic game that you have to check out. And the first title I'm gonna go over is

5
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,140
something called The Neverhood. Some of you might know what this game is but a lot of you don't

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,299
because it sold so awfully and was released at such an odd time in gaming's history that

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:38,579
it went under the radar, very very much so. And it's unfortunate because the creator,

8
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,979
Doug Tenable, this is kind of his baby, he's the guy that if you don't know who Doug Tenable is,

9
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:49,140
he created Earthworm Jim. He's the guy responsible for Earthworm Jim so that alone is the reason why

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,640
you should check out this game. So what do you say we get started? I'm gonna do this very very much

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,039
in a review style, gonna show you a whole lot of clips, gonna show you a whole lot of stuff,

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,520
condense it down, you know the deal. So what do you say we go back in time?

13
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:16,040
The year is 1996 and the age of PC gaming is just starting to flourish. Large companies were

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,840
starting to realize that video games not only could function well on the PC but compete with

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,439
the popular gaming consoles. This was also the tail end of the adventure game era, a certain

16
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,920
genre that had players problem solve and pay attention to detail rather than shoot up a room

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,680
full of enemies. The Neverhood is one of those games and unfortunately the room full of enemies

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,560
I just mentioned is the reason why this game was killed. Selling just 42,000 copies, which by today's

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,319
standards is like getting hit by a tornado, the Neverhood died out fairly quickly, which is very

20
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:56,120
unfortunate because this game is absolutely in my top five greatest games of all time, all time,

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:04,200
and here's why. If you want to talk about style points for a game, the Neverhood is absolutely

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,280
off the charts when it comes to style. Everything you see, every environment, every person, every

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,759
character, everything was crafted entirely out of clay. There's no camera tricks, there's no CGI,

24
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:22,919
everything is real, in real space, and I think that adds a lot to the realism of the game and

25
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,680
how you can get lost in games like this. Too many games nowadays don't imply real space.

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,319
I find it a lot easier to fall into these characters and get sucked into the world when

27
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,159
they're actually real. I feel the same way with movies. You go back to John Carpenter's The Thing

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,719
or one of the Alien movies or any movie that actually had real creatures in it that were

29
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,360
crafted by an animatronic or by Jim Henson, you're going to talk about much more realism

30
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:58,300
and much more frightening things. So the plot of this game is you play a character named Clayman

31
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,740
who just wakes up on the ground with no backstory, nothing is there, there's no introduction, you just

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,580
appear on the ground, and it is your duty as the player to find out why you're even playing the

33
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,620
game in the first place. You do this by collecting these random cassette tapes that happen to be on

34
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,500
the ground all over the world. You then take those tapes and put them in these various tape

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,699
players that play the entire story. Once you collect all the tapes, you pretty much complete

36
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:35,060
the game. These discs are all that are left of the true story, true story of the closing of the third

37
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,020
age. This is a fantastic example of reverse storytelling where nobody tells you anything,

38
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,259
you don't get any info, you don't get any hints, you just figure it all out on your own.

39
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,939
And the story is actually very very interesting, it's not one of those games where you get to the

40
00:03:49,939 --> 00:04:02,180
end and you go, oh well that was stupid. It's actually a pretty good story. Like any adventure

41
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,180
game, the gameplay revolves around problem solving and puzzles. The difficulty can be described as

42
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,500
stupidly easy to tear your hair out of your skull difficult. There's actually a puzzle in this game

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,620
that mimics memory, if you know what memory is. Memory is the game where you flip over tiles and

44
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,699
you have to match different icons. That's great and all, but in this version if you miss one time

45
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:31,399
or if you mess up once, the entire board is deleted. Which brings me to the next point about the

46
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:38,279
gameplay, get a pen and paper. You're gonna need to write down a lot of stuff. I would actually

47
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,800
say if you do not write down half of the information you see in this game, you will never complete it,

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:55,050
you will never beat the game. The game is also fairly short. If you blaze through every task and

49
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,290
you don't spend a whole lot of time exploring the world, you can beat this game in less than two

50
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,410
hours. But you don't really play this game for the gameplay. You play this game for the sheer amount

51
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,889
of style, the unbelievable cast of characters and you get to see a game that was created not for money

52
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,740
but for passion, art and creativity. Those are the reasons why you play this game and it's not

53
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,779
something you can sit here and watch, it's something that you have to experience. And hopefully there's

54
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,699
a rumor going around that the Neverhood is gonna make it to mobile devices, whether that be iPad,

55
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,060
iPhone, Android. So hopefully that all goes through because that would be amazing if we could all play

56
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,779
this game and pay a little bit of money for it, pay the developers what they actually deserve rather

57
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:43,379
than have them get thrown under the bus for years. So hopefully you guys check this game out, I really

58
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,899
do recommend you do it. I will see you guys all next time and enjoy yourself in the Neverhood.

59
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,899
Take care everybody.
