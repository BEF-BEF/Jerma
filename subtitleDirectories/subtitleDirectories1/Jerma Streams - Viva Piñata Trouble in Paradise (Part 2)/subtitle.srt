00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:08,150
I want to read this one. Viva Pinata ran its course. Resident sleeper Drew Crew is out in full force.

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:17,269
Oh, so we didn't run Drew Crew's course with like five streams and like 17 hours of gameplay?

3
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:29,899
I think you- I think you're holding on to something there. It's been like three and a half hours of

4
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:41,939
Viva Pinata. Do you guys act like I've streamed this game for the last like four years straight?

5
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:51,500
Holy shit, Viva Pinata. It's been 75 hours of this game straight. I played it yesterday for like

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:01:14,810
three hours. I need to check on my animals and that's what we're gonna do. Check on your animal

7
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:26,709
crossing village. I can't. It's not here. I got- my girlfriend needs something. I gotta have something

8
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:33,879
to do. She's playing animal crossing. I'm playing my version of animal crossing which is animal

9
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:46,060
related and it's called Viva Pinata out of control. What am I supposed to name the game?

10
00:01:46,060 --> 00:02:00,920
Trouble in paradise. That's the one. It's the animal crossing wannabe. They both came out the

11
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:09,180
same time. I'm opening it up. We're going. This is what I want to play. This is what we're gonna play.

12
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:22,680
Where's my headphones? What the fuck happened? Where are my headphones? Why am- why are my

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,199
headphones not in this room? Wait, they were connected yesterday. What? Hold on a second.

14
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:40,490
Why are my headphones not here? What the fuck? I didn't take them out of here. This doesn't make

15
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:51,129
any sense. I got them. They were wrapped up in the bottom of the chair. Okay, we're good.

16
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:06,620
No, it wasn't Kim. It wasn't Kim. All right, I got them. We're good. Imagine that. All right,

17
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:21,259
here we go. Did we just get bits? We did. We did right now. Very nice. Gave 20 dollars in bits.

18
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:30,520
Can you guys even hear this? Yeah, you can't hear. 20 bucks in bits. 2,000. Love you,

19
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,819
German. Always stay safe, bro. That's been very nice. Well, I think that's very nice. So,

20
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:47,990
thank you. Don't mind me just passing through. All right, what were we doing? I wanted to get-

21
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:55,259
Okay, here we go. Oh, yes, there they are. It's been so long since I've seen you two.

22
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:17,779
Wouldn't they just drown? Wait, wouldn't that frog be like in- like swallowing water? Wake them up.

23
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:26,300
All right, so let me- okay, right, right, right. That's what I was gonna do. I got a plan. We're

24
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:34,779
gonna get cats. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats eat mice. Mice have sex. Mice make more mice.

25
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:43,930
Feed cats. Cats have sex. What do cats need? We'll find out maybe eventually here. Okay,

26
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:55,689
give me my shovel. I need crabs too. Wait. All right, send that person off in a cannon. I'll

27
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,250
level up if I do this, right? Yeah. Anyways, I didn't do an intro. Hey, guys. Welcome to the

28
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:22,060
stream. Fucking cool. Where's that? Where's the cannon box? That was lame. Do it again.

29
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:30,149
No, I already did my intro. I don't know. This isn't like 2012. I don't need to be like, hey,

30
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:43,899
what's going on, everybody? It's Jerma here with another stream. No, where- this is 2020.

31
00:05:43,899 --> 00:06:04,459
That was better. He's unprofessional. Gameplay. In that way, how come it's not shooting at all?

32
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:19,930
How many do I need to pack in here? Did I not pack it? I did. So why is the cannon not shooting?

33
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:26,120
Like my post if I'm here- if you're here from the discord. I got it. I am. Has to be a new- oh.

34
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,639
So did I just remove that person for no reason? Kind of annoying. All right, what's most- whatever

35
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:44,660
I want. Like my post if you're here from the discord. All right, what do you think? I'm

36
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:54,600
thinking sand. I'm thinking sand over this way. Yep. That looks good to me. I don't want that

37
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:01,670
much sand though because I- don't the snakes not like sand? Fix the noise gate on your microphone.

38
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:08,629
Don't worry. In like- in a week, I won't even be in the same place. We'll fix that some other

39
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:23,060
way. Why is the sound fucked up? I mean it seems like it's working. No, there's this-

40
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:46,629
like what's wrong with it? Yeah, it's working. It's working. It's fine. Do a stream from the back of

41
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:56,139
the moving van. Like I'm just sitting back there. Just like sit at a desk trying to like stream

42
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:04,410
something. What happened? Like why- why don't- why- why's my right analog not work now?

43
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,220
What the fuck? Why can I not- up and down on my analog doesn't do anything?

44
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:42,309
Okay. What the hell is going on? What's that? What's that mean? What's that? What's that mean?

45
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,659
Battery? Well, why can I go forward? Wait, there's no battery going to the right analog?

46
00:08:51,639 --> 00:09:17,419
Battery going to X? What? Hold on. I do it. He's orange. Stop. I just want to play with my animals.

47
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,519
Why does the right analog not fucking work? What does this take for batteries?

48
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:41,019
Two double A? Got it right here. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, surgery. Surgery on stream. I didn't even

49
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:53,960
sedate this guy. I didn't even- I didn't even get anesthesia. Sorry. Which way does it go?

50
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,830
Which way does it go? Wait, did you take- you can't take that serial number and like fucking

51
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:15,129
like do anything to me, right? All right, let's- where's uh- how does it go? Wait, oh fuck!

52
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:22,840
God damn it, they're all the same brand! And I just dropped them. I think- wait, I don't remember.

53
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:38,330
I think this is it. My brand. Why are you orange? Because this fucking white balance isn't set up

54
00:10:38,330 --> 00:11:00,889
right now. I don't know. What? Okay. L. The triggers don't work. The bumpers work. B doesn't work.

55
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:11,320
B doesn't work? What's going on? Those are the right batteries. Okay, up and down works. Start

56
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:23,370
works. B does work. So why does the right analog not work? The triggers don't work either. Hold on,

57
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:32,330
I gotta- I gotta restart the fucking game? Smash the controller in the closet. No, no, no. Let me-

58
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:47,240
Hold on. This doesn't make any sense. Controller style? What? What? What the hell?

59
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:22,820
Why would they do that? Why would that even be an option? Simple controls. Well, all simple

60
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,450
controls does is just remove the function of half of your controller. All right, where- okay, let's

61
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:49,419
go. Okay, I want to do more- I want to do more grass over here. This dude does like a dirt over

62
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:59,019
here. Get the crab? I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm trying. I'm just trying to make this look a little

63
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:13,929
better. I just got an expanded- I got an expanded ground. Cheeto puff controller?

64
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,370
Let's do dirt. Yeah, over to here. Getting rid of this- yeah, that's like a little beach. That's

65
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:36,539
fine. The snakes don't like this though. I'm gonna- let me change this. Turn the orange cam back on.

66
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:47,929
It's fine. No, I don't like this because you can see my fucking red eyes from like sleeping

67
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:53,850
two hours a night. No, I don't like that. You guys can see my like my fucking like two hours of

68
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:15,240
sleep eyes. You should wink. I'm not fucking winking. He's high. Please. I'm trying to make

69
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,120
this place look better. What shit are you wearing? What shit?

70
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,679
It's a Pac-Man t-shirt. Are you out of your fucking mind?

71
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,919
Look at how messed up this is. Let me plant down- it doesn't matter. I'll fix it.

72
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,120
I just don't want this to look so shitty because this looks awful.

73
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,399
Look at how much cleaner this is gonna start to look now.

74
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,240
How's David doing? I don't know. I don't know- I don't know who David is.

75
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,600
All right, that's better. We got a little pond over there. Now let's put this away.

76
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,700
Now I'd like- why are you- what are you doing? Why the fuck is she doing?

77
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:20,629
It's the guy you stole the Xbox from. I didn't steal any Xbox actually. This is- this was- I

78
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:26,970
bought it. All right, now we need a little bit more. We'll do desert over here. How do I get

79
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:38,570
you to get in here? Just eat one of these mice. Hurry up. Let's do desert over here. You bought a

80
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:50,460
stolen Xbox. I don't- I don't think that's what happened. I think I made that name.

81
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,659
I don't know why but maybe- I don't know. I did for some reason. I can't think of a reason why.

82
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:10,899
That's a liar. I don't know. Maybe I'll check and see what David's like play history is, right?

83
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:20,950
All right, that's good. All right, this is a daisy. I need some more. Look at this. It's starting

84
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:27,139
to come together. What's in here? What the hell is this? Oh shit, it's another- another water

85
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:36,379
tube. Wait, what happened to the other water tube? Did somebody eat it? Who ate it? Did somebody eat

86
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:47,190
that old water tube? Oh, it's like a little lily pad. I did. Well, you fucking shouldn't have done

87
00:16:47,190 --> 00:17:08,519
that. How much water can the watercress take in? Too much. Okay, so we get the- this is good.

88
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,039
So what does it take for a crab again? We need much more water. So I'm thinking- so we got a

89
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,049
little sand portion over there. We need more sand. I'm thinking another sand portion this way,

90
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,130
right? Because this is- we could bring the crabs in over here. That's what I'm thinking.

91
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:32,599
You're right, I shouldn't have done that. The streamer is pissed. Why am I pissed?

92
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,769
Is it because I'm like red?

93
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:53,579
You know what we're gonna do tomorrow? And for the next 30 to 40 straight days, this.

94
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:02,309
I'm gonna play Viva Pinata every single fucking goddamn day

95
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:15,140
the rest of my life until I'm 100. Because I'm- I'm- I'm making it to 100, okay? You know how

96
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:23,339
many green vegetables I eat on a weekly basis? Not enough. Probably like one serving a week,

97
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,259
which is bad. You should be- you should do like a green serving of vegetables every fucking day.

98
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:33,140
At least every other day. But now that I think about it, I'll probably- nutritionally speaking,

99
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,700
I'll probably make it to like 61. So that's why I gotta start now. I've got to start eating green

100
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:51,140
vegetables on every meal. Oh, seeds. When my mask gets broken, I fix it with flour and water paste.

101
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:59,819
You gotta start like 20 years ago, dude. I actually- I actually eat very well. I eat at least

102
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:09,059
one green vegetable at every meal. Can I even do this with a straight face? Oh, the trick stick.

103
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:22,599
Let's try that. Tahini- I have tahini paste at every meal. Uh, plant dried out. Didn't I just

104
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,980
overwater this like five fucking seconds ago? Oh, the $20- a $20 donation just came in a bit.

105
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:36,789
From Very Noise. Another one. 2,000 bits. Thanks, dude. Thank you for that. 40- that's 4,000 bits

106
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:46,339
total in the last like 10 minutes. Thank you. The Cheez-Its have made him orange. Should I fix it?

107
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:53,660
You want me to fix it so it's not orange? You want me to put like a- like a handsome filter on?

108
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:28,440
No. What? Why? Put the handsome filter on? Hold on. Wait, this is wrong. What? Hold on. Something's

109
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:42,309
wrong here. I can't get- it doesn't- it looks wrong like this and it looks wrong like this.

110
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,910
Okay, here we go. Right? All right, we'll put the handsome filter on here in a second.

111
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,970
I could- I could be- I could be anything. You can imagine the rest of my features.

112
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:44,460
See how handsome this is? What's going on? No, fuck! You know what the worst part about this is?

113
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,960
You know when you're watching a streamer and they have autofocus on, which by the way,

114
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,039
you want a streamer tip, turn autofocus off because what happens is it gets like this

115
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:59,980
and they don't even know it's like that and the camera is fucking struggling so hard to just-

116
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,539
please refocus it and it could be like this for about two to three straight minutes.

117
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:16,039
But we're going to keep it here for five straight minutes. Wait, how else can I change this to make

118
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:19,559
it- how else can I change it to be like, hey streamer, something's wrong with your webcam?

119
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:38,259
How about this? All right, this is- this is- I just plugged it in. Yeah. This is- I just plugged

120
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:43,690
the webcam in and didn't even do one setting. I just turned the fucking stream on after- this

121
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:56,970
is not even default. I just plugged it in and turned it on. No, actually that- it'd be more

122
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,930
like this. This is more accurate. If you just plugged it in for the first time and didn't even

123
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:18,970
fucking do any settings. Let's make me a little bit more handsome though. Now this is- this is

124
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:25,509
just the- this is the side image for every copypasta villain or monster you've ever read about.

125
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:55,099
Like, yeah, like turn the blur off. Yeah, it has to be forward and like eyes wide open and mouth

126
00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:06,660
wide open. We can do a better one, hold on. Really close too, like- can we be dead? This is actually

127
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:50,220
scary. It's delayed. Oh, whoa, look at that guy. Kind of looks all right. I'm scaring me. All right,

128
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,980
get this off. Go shave. It's a process, okay? It's a- you know, you know when Jeremy goes like this

129
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:05,849
and he gets like right into the fucking camera and he goes like, keep the cam on. No, all right,

130
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:22,259
I- people- animals are over here. What? Oh shit, real face. This is what I really look like.

131
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:27,380
Fuck. Come on, man. We can't do that.

132
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:45,059
Here we go. This hurts my fucking eyes. I'm done. Oh, there he is for real. Now let's go the other

133
00:25:45,059 --> 00:26:29,099
way. Oh, this is what I look like. Oh shit. Oh, fuck. This sound is freaking me out.

134
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,740
What's- my skin doesn't look like this. What's with my lips? All right, I've just burnt. I can

135
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:41,420
only stream for like three or four hours and I've already burnt like- burnt, burnt. I've already

136
00:26:41,420 --> 00:27:01,269
burnt. Say it. Do it right. I've already burnt like 30 minutes. I just burnt it. Nothing's real.

137
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:28,309
Nothing is real. Nothing is real. All right, what the fuck was I doing? Sounds fucking with my head.

138
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:47,509
All right, let's go. I need a surfboard in the garden. You got it. Where do I get it? Who sells

139
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:54,470
a surfboard? It's desynced. What the fuck are you talking about? What are chocolate coins if not

140
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:03,509
for spending? I'd spend- It's not desynced. Better value. It's not desynced. What? It's not. No,

141
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,119
it can't be. It can't be. I refuse to believe them. Don't believe them. All right, so we need a

142
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:21,140
toy surfboard, right? Toys? Woo woo train? Where do I get a surfboard? Toad voice. It's horribly

143
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:33,990
desynced. Okay, I don't believe you. The camera is set to be- Hold on. No. The camera is set to be

144
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:42,039
delayed by 650 milliseconds. The microphone is 650 milliseconds. Ready? That's- This is how you know.

145
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:58,650
I do know because they're both set for 650. Yes, so now it's 650. My mic is 650. You're burning time.

146
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:12,650
You guys are burning time. I've got three hours. You're burning time. My voice is early. My voice

147
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:32,650
is early. This happens before the mouth moves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I already said

148
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:46,009
fucking go. No, they're right. They're right. Okay. I need a surfboard. Do I not have access

149
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:55,720
to a surfboard yet or what? I can't- I don't have a surfboard. When do you get a surfboard?

150
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,380
Does anybody know? Stop sign. It's going to be in the toys. They probably don't have it.

151
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:13,859
This is some kind of currency thing. No one plays this game. This is such a- People love this game.

152
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:19,220
You guys are being mean to this series for no reason. It's- This is like a fun game. Like the

153
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:24,579
piñata animals. Like, come on. What a fucking idea. A new piñata has been spotted in the desert. Ooh,

154
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:33,109
let's go. He's scared of the duck. I don't know. I can't have a surfboard. But piñatas. Like,

155
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:49,140
that's so- Look at how cool that is. All right. You got to explain to me how catching fish in

156
00:30:49,140 --> 00:31:07,049
Animal Crossing is pog. But watching frog in lake is un-pog. I need an explanation here. Neither are

157
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:25,099
pog. Neither. You tell me that serpent one is un-pog. But if I- That was pretty un-pog.

158
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,299
Okay. So let's go over this again. So this is un-pog. But if I took the head off

159
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:42,539
this snake and put it on a standing body, gave him a shovel, and had him go like this.

160
00:31:47,420 --> 00:32:01,589
That would be pog. I just want to make sure I get the facts correct with my brain.

161
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:14,460
Yes. Yo, that's pog. Why does this guy hate Animal Crossing? I love Animal Crossing.

162
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,019
But I don't- I refuse to believe that this is an un-pog moment right here.

163
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:56,740
That was not a good example. I like them both. And they both are fun. And I can't wait for Viva

164
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:08,440
Piñata 3. On the road again. Coming soon for the Xbox Scorpion. I'll be the guy that plays it.

165
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:19,930
All right. What does this person want? All right. You guys, I know what you're doing.

166
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:29,769
So fucking tactful. You're distracting me and derailing things so we can- You're burning time.

167
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:45,819
Fucking smart. Real smart. Pretty good idea. And I get it now. I'm very easy to- I'm very

168
00:33:45,819 --> 00:34:02,549
manipulatable apparently. It's still working. All right. I'm going to go back to what I was doing

169
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:12,730
in my pog experience. Digging holes in this game sucks. But if you dig a hole in Animal Crossing-

170
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:35,780
I can't even put it there. I want to put two images side by side. I want to put this

171
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,460
with resident sleepers and then I want to put the Animal Crossing dig with like a bunch of pogs.

172
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:52,900
Somebody get on it. Somebody get on it. Oh, this has to be desert, desert, desert, desert, desert.

173
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:59,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a terrible meme. It's not a- I'm not making a meme. That's from my

174
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:07,320
personal collection. I'm going to have that playing on a Roku stick behind me in a frame

175
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:27,980
for the next six weeks. Where does this go? What the fuck is this thing? Doesn't this go in the

176
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,730
desert? What's this? This is not the right- Oh, does this have to go in soil? Oh,

177
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:50,920
forever sucks at this game. It's a reddit joke. I have a feeling that all the people that talk

178
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:59,909
all this shit about reddit have like a post history. It's like 30 pages long. Fucking redditor.

179
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:09,210
I can't believe he uses reddit. And then you go to the like- you slash- whatever the name is.

180
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:16,010
Here it is. Like 10 pages. Like r slash smash brothers. They've been on- they have like 600

181
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:29,099
posts. And they're all at least a paragraph each. That's un-pog. All right, I gotta go back to the

182
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,980
desert. I want to find the new- good work. You're doing a good job. Look at you guys. Look at you

183
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:50,340
go. Look at- look at- look at you go. Uh, no, I don't want to go to the Arctic. I want a gecko.

184
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:59,719
Yes, I do. I don't think I've been here at night. Irma actually made me have fun. How

185
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:08,659
does he do it? What do you mean I made you- what? We're just hanging out here, man.

186
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:24,840
We're just having fun, man. You're forcing fun. What did you guys think? I have some like fucking

187
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:40,170
streamer playbook on how to like- we're having fun in a jail cell. I've never heard of a Java- Java

188
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:46,250
prison system where the doors are all unlocked and you can leave the prison at any time.

189
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:53,940
Yeah, sorry, you're sentenced for 20 years in prison. By the way, uh, you know, the doors are

190
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,059
all open and you can just- you can leave whenever you want, sir. This is a- what do you mean prison?

191
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,400
You can just walk out of yourself, walk out the door, and go to the nearest Wendy's and

192
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:51,960
order a fucking number four. What are you guys doing? I love the 4% battery. All right, I need

193
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:10,019
to lock this fucking thing in place. All right, let me ask you a question. Would you- would you

194
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:15,059
swipe left on this person? Wait, is it right? Would you swipe- all right, would you swipe right

195
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:31,510
on this? Yeah, I think this is one of those cases where you go, oh, I mean, it's all right, but

196
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:38,840
you got any like other pictures? And then the next four pictures are me, like, with my face

197
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,559
blocked out like this, and this is another person, and this is another person, and I'm like-

198
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,719
I'm like peeking through like this. This is where they are. It's like this.

199
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:06,309
I'd fucking- I- why would I- I'd swipe right on that person because that person's me. If I was on

200
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:11,030
tinder, it'd be like, oh yeah, that guy looks all right. I'd fucking hang out with that guy.

201
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:29,019
Gecko alert! Gecko alert! You're an egomaniac. Set off early and catch some good stuff. I like

202
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:35,139
your style. Some of the- some of the smartest people ever were, and the most successful,

203
00:40:35,219 --> 00:41:05,989
and the coolest people ever were egomaniacs. Like, um, who's like an egomaniac that was

204
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:09,590
really successful that now everyone doesn't look back and go, oh, that person sucked?

205
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:19,860
Is that gonna happen to me? In like 40 years, are you guys gonna be like in your 40s and 50s

206
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:28,920
and look back and be like, oh wow, that guy sucked? Shit. All right, we're gonna dial it back.

207
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,320
I'm like a- I'm like a- look, here's the safe way to answer any of these questions.

208
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,199
Oh, what do you- how good looking do you think you are? I'm like a seven. I'm a seven, I think.

209
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,250
And then people are like, okay, that's not too high, but that's not too low. You got like some

210
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:50,199
confidence. Yeah, all right. I'm a seven. Just say seven for everything. Oh, I just- I just- that

211
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,719
was a home-cooked meal. I just cooked it for you, and I- what did you think? If you didn't like it,

212
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:03,929
that was like- I'm a seven. I was into it. 75. Sounds pretty good. Or if you are reviewing- if

213
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:10,070
you're reviewing any movie, TV show, video game, or book, just do that too. It works everywhere.

214
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:28,329
75 is terrible. 75 is not terrible. 75 is- I thought this was terrible,

215
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,610
but I didn't want to tell you that it was terrible. Fuck! Don't listen to that. I've done this like

216
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:41,739
10 times already on this stream. Uh-oh. No, now everyone's gonna go back and look for all the

217
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:56,070
sevens I gave to games. Oh, shit. Uh, what have I done the two recently? He gave a seven to Outer

218
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:02,659
Wilds. I did not. No, I did not. I gave that an 89. Get out of here. I did not give Animal Crossing

219
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:11,860
a seven. I did not. Outer Wilds was an 89. He hates Mario Sunshine. I didn't even- I didn't even

220
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:24,139
score Mario Sunshine. What are you talking about? He gave a seven to that ninja game. Oh, okay,

221
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:43,269
this is the image I was looking for. Rate Animal Crossing. No, I can't. Because if I give Animal

222
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:49,030
Crossing a score, it's either too low throw rocks at his house or it's too high. That game's boring.

223
00:43:49,030 --> 00:44:06,619
What an idiot. This- I don't think I can take a position on there. Get the rocks. They're in my

224
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:15,980
eye. I'm having fun. It doesn't matter. It could be anything in the fucking screen right now.

225
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:41,190
All right, what was it? Here. I like Animal Crossing. This is- this is just a little, like,

226
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:46,630
this is just a little shtick, you know what I mean? But it's- I like- I really like- I really

227
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:54,650
like Animal Crossing. No one- wait. Why is there- why is there- why is there dialogue in the left

228
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:06,179
one? Why is there dialogue in the left one? Who's Lily? Lily, League of Legends team? What the fuck

229
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:24,519
did you get this from? The Legends team. What did you get this fucking image from? All right,

230
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:32,570
anyways. What was I just saying? It's a random screen cap. Oh yeah, I need a trap. Business

231
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:44,940
edition. That's not necessary. You are a boomer. All right, that- what do you want me to say? Yeah,

232
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:54,789
yes I am. Yeah, yes I am. I'm a boomer at me. Like, how do I respond to that? What's the proper way

233
00:45:54,789 --> 00:46:08,309
to respond to somebody saying that now? All right, now I need a- what do they- they want a snow thing?

234
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:18,840
They know. I don't even know- I'm- that's- but that's the thing, I'm not even. All right, come on. No

235
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,750
snake. You go get this. I won't- look at- look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that,

236
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,070
look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that, yep, look at that,

237
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:51,400
yep, look at that, got it. Resident sleeper, resident sleeper, resident sleeper, resident sleeper.

238
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,469
You know, I'm gonna record something right now and then when I- the more- when I see them, I'm

239
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:18,260
just gonna- hold on. Yeah, let's go back. Well, not- there's a cooldown on it. I know you guys are just

240
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:28,300
doing it for fun now. All right, where's my- let's go get it. I finally am gonna get a gecko.

241
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:38,360
We're not. This is boring. I'll press it right now and it'll- you'll be- wait, this is not even

242
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:47,239
centered. This looks fucked up. What did you guys do? Well, hey, what the fuck did you just do?

243
00:47:51,800 --> 00:48:15,380
What did- what did you do? What did you do? I'm sorry! All right, here we go. You don't like the

244
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:23,289
frogs. Frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a- there's a frog at the bottom- there's a leg on

245
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:27,690
the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a leg on the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a

246
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:33,210
sea, there's a sea, there's a hole at the bottom of the sea. There's a ward on the- ward on the leg

247
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,210
of the frog at- ward on the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a ward on the leg on

248
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:45,420
the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a hole at the bottom of the sea. There's a fly on the

249
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,699
ward of the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a fly on the leg- there's a fly on

250
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:54,980
the ward of the leg of the frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a- there's something down there

251
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:04,940
at the bottom of the sea. There's a hair on the fly in the ward of the frog. There's a- there's a

252
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,940
hair- there's a hair on the fly in the- there's a hair on the fly on the ward of the leg of the

253
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,150
frog at the bottom of the sea. There's a hair on the fly in the ward of the frog in the log- fuck!

254
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:39,670
You guys didn't go to preschool? How many- what- you guys how- ow! What you made me do? I'm not

255
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,190
American. What you guys didn't have like the- there's a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a

256
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,670
this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a this, and a that,

257
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,949
and then everyone's like laughs, and has fun, everyone's like moving around, and cheering,

258
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:56,659
and stuff. What- what- what- what happened? You guys didn't do that? You just don't remember you

259
00:49:56,659 --> 00:50:04,809
did. I do. I remember everything. Nobody had that. I feel bad that you didn't have the fucking this,

260
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:09,860
and the this, and the this, and the this, and the this, and the this thing. It was so much fun.

261
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:24,500
I actually did. Yeah, I know. Good. What are you doing? Look, all right. I'm gonna- okay, I'll get-

262
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:33,860
I know- I- I know that there's- I know that about that chocolate factory. Okay? I know it- I know

263
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:43,480
that the chocolate factory is- I know that's a chocolate factory. All right. What are you guys

264
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:51,619
linking? You got- I'm- but wait a minute, but I'm running out of time here. I hate that I know

265
00:50:51,619 --> 00:51:08,789
what you're talking about. See? I knew it. What? What's wrong with this? You guys- here's the bad

266
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:12,949
meme you asked for. Wait, did- we already showed- wait, have you been gone for the last like 30

267
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:26,309
minutes making this? Somebody did it already. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But this one's good too.

268
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:49,960
This one's also good. This is seven out of ten? Hey. Hey! Hey! No, this is- I would give this- I

269
00:51:49,960 --> 00:52:03,769
would give this an eight. Okay, here we go. What the fuck am I doing? I want- where's the gecko?

270
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:10,619
Did you guys make me lose my gecko? I think you actually made me lose the gecko. I think he left.

271
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:26,119
You gotta be kidding me. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Gecko's gone. Play- play

272
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:50,420
Tokyo. No. I'm gonna play Ikaruga. I'll play Ikaruga tomorrow. I can beat that game in like

273
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:59,369
two or three hours. You guys don't think I'll be able to do Ikaruga? Oh, you've got something.

274
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:14,150
You'll see. You should play as a guaranteed no. You don't have to beat every game in one stream.

275
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:22,139
I mean, Ikaruga's only- I looked up time to beat and it said an hour and a half.

276
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:30,519
I think I could do it. Here, this is important. Please, can you pretty please get me a kitty?

277
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,829
Yeah, sure. The cat doesn't want to come over here. There's plenty of food over here.

278
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:42,579
All right, now I- where are the ducks? Ducks need to eat crabs. I need a taffy.

279
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:49,099
I'm starting to loomer. Sorry about that. I've played Resident Evil 4, god damn it.

280
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:22,309
Is this- is this- is this just shout games that you like our- is this just yell games that you like

281
00:54:23,269 --> 00:54:42,780
the hour like Gex? Oh, shit. I have a 3DO. I have like 15 3DO games and I have a 3DO.

282
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:50,019
I was supposed to do that very recently. I was supposed to play a 3DO, but for some reason,

283
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:54,679
I did not do it. I said I was going to do it like next week, but I didn't do it though.

284
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:09,780
Weird that I- weird that- weird that I- kind of weird that I- kind of weird that I- kind of weird

285
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:16,460
that I- okay, what the fucking happened there? I think I messed up. Kind of weird that I bring

286
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:27,909
that up because I was supposed to play Gex like three weeks ago. Real voice revealed.

287
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:45,079
Fuck, Eagle. This game's boring. Play Fortnite. I'm never going to open Fortnite on this stream.

288
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:53,300
Ever. Ever. I will never open that video game on this stream. I got- I got real close.

289
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:59,349
Those of you that know what the Fortnite stream was going to be, it's the only time I was going

290
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:06,940
to open it. That was going to be the vape pen stream. Remember? I was going to be in like

291
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:15,099
stunner shades and like really bright colors and just smash on a fucking vape pen and I was going

292
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:19,019
to have, over the course of like an hour of playing it, I was going to fill this room. I was going to

293
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:23,260
have, well not this one, but I was going to do somewhere that was safe to do it and have

294
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:29,340
fog machines just fill the fucking room with just vapor and I was going to sit in there until I

295
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:42,150
disappeared completely. There was going to be like a- and I was going to still just be fucking

296
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:50,780
doing it and still talking and like just like going for like fucking a shot. That stream was

297
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:57,690
going to be like 40 minutes long but I didn't because that means I'd have to open Fortnite.

298
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:15,050
That's- that's a struggle for me. That was going to happen like two years ago.

299
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:31,340
I just never did it. Someone's just going to steal that joke. I hope it's funny.

300
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:58,280
Here are four- ah! I have to play fucking Viva Piñata! This is a comp- this is a comp stream

301
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:06,809
with the- this is a comp stream with a video in the background. You don't even want to play this,

302
00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:14,460
you know it. No, you are wrong! You are wrong! You're wrong! I think this is fun and I think

303
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:24,360
it's cute. He's not even playing. I- what do you mean not even playing? This is- look at the title

304
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,760
of the stream. This is like looking at an aquarium that you've like reached in sometimes.

305
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:44,809
This is an interactive screensaver. I- why am I playing? Look at how much fun they're having.

306
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:53,860
All right, slow down. I can't believe that you guys aren't getting behind like- I can't believe

307
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:01,960
like Quack Crew is not- where's the Quack Crew at? Where's Quack Crew? Can I manufacture one? Can I

308
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:07,619
like force one of these? I don't think I can do that, can I? Where's the Quack Crew? No, it's- it

309
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:12,489
doesn't work that way. This is like when some like company on social media desperately tries to make

310
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:16,570
their own fucking version of a meme and everyone's like, wow, that was fucking stupid and lame and

311
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:37,900
shitty. Yeah, I can't. Quack Pack! Yeah, where's the Quack Pack? Look it! Uh, guys, where's the

312
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:45,340
Quack Pack? Wow, nice game, Omega Low. You didn't just think that that was fucking cute when he

313
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,380
just drank the water out of the dirt there, like he just like licked it up off the ground. It was

314
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:55,659
like cute. He like was laughing up like a dog. Like, fuck. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp. Grimp.

315
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,449
What? But that's not how that- what that noise makes. It's like,

316
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:25,159
that's not grimp. Gramp? Grimp? Stop distracting me. Okay, I gotta- I gotta water this. Is it

317
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:33,130
already watered all the way? It's sitting in water. I already got stupid. All right, kill this. He

318
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:51,289
sounds like a sim. Jeremy, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What? What? What? What? Shit! Put this down!

319
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:06,420
I'm fine. No, guys, I'm not gonna like after this- I don't know, some of you guys think I like after

320
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,900
the stream is over, I like go and take a hot shower and just like scream into the water. Like,

321
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:23,260
like, I don't just fucking yell in the shower. I mean, I mean, I do- everybody does that though.

322
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:32,300
Who- all right, let me ask them. Who doesn't fill their mouth with water every like 45 seconds in

323
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:38,550
the shower and then just go- just spit it out. Everybody does that. Everybody just goes,

324
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:46,150
fills and then just goes- if you don't do- you're a liar if you don't do that. That's a lie.

325
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,989
Everybody fills their mouth with the fucking water every like minute and then just like

326
01:01:51,989 --> 01:02:20,170
just flushes it off there and out of their mouth. Yes, you do. I- no way. Oh shit. I don't like

327
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:30,059
people watching me drink water. It freaks me out. I admit it, laughing my ass off. Good. You-

328
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:37,900
seriously? Yes, you do. Imagine- can you like imagine lying about if you put water in your

329
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:45,719
mouth and spit it out in the shower into the ground? Come on. I'm sorry, we don't- I don't

330
01:02:45,719 --> 01:03:00,309
drink it. I just- you go and you go- who goes like this? Everybody does. You get in the shower and

331
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:15,750
you go, yes, you do. Yes, you do. You get in the shower and you go like this and like it does- yes,

332
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:25,019
you do. Everybody does that. I want- next time you take a shower, I want you to be very aware

333
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,269
of what you're doing so you don't even realize you're doing it. You get in and like the shower- you're

334
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:32,230
waiting for the shower because you're blocking the shower might not be hot enough or too cold

335
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:36,940
or too hot so you like just getting it ready and then it- yes, it is. I want you to be aware of it

336
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,219
next time and then you're gonna go- you're gonna get in the shower, you're gonna be like, that guy

337
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:45,739
Jerma is a fucking idiot. He's so fucking weird. He's like the weirdest guy I've ever known in my life.

338
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:59,539
He was right! And then you're gonna come- and like in a week, you're gonna fucking come to the stream

339
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:04,599
and you can say, hey man, I've done a week of showers and you were right and I'll be like, I know,

340
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:17,320
welcome back. And then you're gonna do something that I don't even do. You're gonna go like this

341
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,699
and then you're gonna be like, whoa, I do disgusting shit in here apparently

342
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:33,739
and oh oops oh yeah that's- oh no but I- Jerma's the weirdo. Jerma the weirdo. He puts his hands up

343
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:46,550
and like puts water in his mouth. Hold on a second. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. It's- it's

344
01:04:46,550 --> 01:05:04,650
unbelievable. My dad does that and that's- and that's where you get it. You get it from your dad.

345
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:17,909
It's in your- it's in like your DNA. Wait, why?

346
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,260
I'm playing an animal. This is not Animal Crossing.

347
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:33,289
It's okay. This is the worst stream of 2020. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way.

348
01:06:33,369 --> 01:06:42,440
No way. We're not even- we're not even into fucking April. You got way more nominees.

349
01:06:55,739 --> 01:07:00,860
You promised me a kitty. I can't just fucking- I gotta wait for one of them to get in here.

350
01:07:01,739 --> 01:07:11,449
I'm actually having a lot of fun. I don't know what you guys are talking about. I'm having like

351
01:07:11,449 --> 01:07:15,530
a ton of fun. Can I like nominate this for like most like fucking quirky stream of-

352
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:47,940
Oh, there's no cat. Get back here. No. If you didn't like, no, I'm Petula. My runs used to run

353
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:56,099
this shop till the- I suppose you better select a piñata to give this to. Oh my fucking god.

354
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:24,699
First select where the accessory should go on your piñata. Oh, that's good. Oh, that's so funny.

355
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:57,500
Should I give him German hair? How about the wizard? Okay, what about eyes? No, no glasses.

356
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:12,170
No glasses. A nose ring? Oh, I could do a clown nose. Holy shit. No. No, I don't want that. I don't

357
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:21,210
want that. I want little shoes though. Is that the only shoes? I want like little sneakers.

358
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:46,460
What about this? What about the bow tie? No, I don't want- I don't want the hair. I want something

359
01:09:46,699 --> 01:10:02,390
on the head. Look at that. So cute. Clown nose over riot. There's like 10 animals to do this to.

360
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:25,479
This. Okay, that looks all right. Good choice. Well, now we need- now we need to do it to the-

361
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:35,260
look at- look at how cool he looks. I don't want you to have anything. I'm always a frog. I want

362
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:44,579
the frog to have something. The snake. Yep. This is real exciting. Can somebody link the other

363
01:10:44,579 --> 01:11:03,539
Animal Crossing shovel image again, please? Oh, I love the hard hat. It's perfect. Oh, the wizard

364
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:20,949
cap. Yes, the hard hat. Hard hat and like glasses. Oh, they- they don't go like this? They- shouldn't

365
01:11:20,949 --> 01:11:29,210
they go like that? Click that link. What do you mean me click that link? This is for you to click.

366
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:52,619
German, what the fuck? This is like- okay. This is what it looks like when you go back and look at

367
01:11:52,619 --> 01:12:02,649
like history and paintings and shit. This is like a historical painting of me. If I was- if I was

368
01:12:02,649 --> 01:12:16,460
like some- some like fucking senator from like 1402 or like 1400. But like I actually look like this

369
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:32,630
looking at a mirror in a dream. Yeah, I was gonna say this is like dreamy person. Let's see if I

370
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:48,250
can match it. There's no difference. Yes, there is. There's a fucking huge difference. I need this one

371
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,560
to be moving, though. You guys gotta tell me which one's real. You already fucking know. What

372
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:33,770
are you talking about? It's like before and after. Yeah, it's before and after I get like

373
01:13:33,770 --> 01:14:09,899
cosmetic surgery. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. There. All right. Yeah, that's like before and

374
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:34,710
after. I go- I go get like some work done. I'm not growing out my beard. Wow, he fucking hates this

375
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:40,250
game.

376
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:57,420
What are you guys doing? What are you doing? Stop. You have less than two hours to play. I know. I'm

377
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:17,220
sorry. I'm trying. How did I bite my lip? Fuck, did I bite my lip?

378
01:15:25,579 --> 01:15:34,859
Why, what the fuck? We already went over this.

379
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:46,039
We've already talked about that. Remember kids, everything you write is saved forever on the

380
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:52,199
internet. Don't forget that ever. I wrote this like a year or two ago and it's still here.

381
01:15:52,680 --> 01:16:08,569
It's- I have what? Okay. Okay, cool. I will do one more. Let's do the frog.

382
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:20,390
Okay. I suppose I'll pick a piñata. Sure, how about you?

383
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:36,250
All right, the frog's gonna have a big top hat. Yes. Oh. Oh, you could marry. And a monocle,

384
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:54,840
of course. Yes, and the monocle will be bright. And is a piece of Professor Clown,

385
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:12,020
Professor Clownsworth. This is just Mr. Peanut. Mr. Peanut. What the fuck?

386
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:35,220
No, no, none of this. Wait. Yes. No, it's- Thanks on behalf of my absence. When you get back to

387
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:44,630
your garden, you should like think about me. Okay. I won't say bye because you'll probably be right

388
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:53,399
back in here really soon. All right. Now, what's it gonna look like? Let me, let me, let's see.

389
01:17:53,399 --> 01:18:04,789
What am I gonna do? Let me just fucking, let me just. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. There's only like

390
01:18:04,789 --> 01:18:09,829
this. I got eight more seconds before this doesn't work anymore. Okay. I'm thinking about, let's see

391
01:18:09,829 --> 01:18:24,470
what I want to do here. Come on. Big spin. Big spin here. What do we got? Big spin. Yeah. I don't

392
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:38,890
care. I don't care if you didn't like it. I don't care. I think I'm gonna get some yams.

393
01:18:53,560 --> 01:19:09,369
Okay. So what do I need? I was gonna buy a reminder. Stream ends in one hour and 40 minutes.

394
01:19:09,369 --> 01:19:17,180
Fucking god damn it. Do I need to put more time on this shit? It's been an hour and 20 minutes

395
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:35,699
already. Fuck. Okay. I want to do some paving. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Stone. Stone. Insert another

396
01:19:35,699 --> 01:19:42,840
coin. Put more quarters in. Where do I want to put the stones? I think I want to put them over here

397
01:19:42,840 --> 01:20:01,340
next to the snakes. Yeah. Like this. A little bit here. A little bit like over here. Okay. I'm bored.

398
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:24,979
Let's play Mario Yahtzee. No. You look better. I don't, what are you doing? Why are you, why are

399
01:20:24,979 --> 01:20:40,890
you linking this? Why are you linking? I don't know what this is for. 2015. Okay. So this is,

400
01:20:41,689 --> 01:20:45,770
this is the, the day that Battlefront came out. The original Battlefront.

401
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:56,180
How else do you want me to explain this? This is me pretending to be really excited for Battlefront.

402
01:20:56,180 --> 01:21:05,939
You knew I needed to explain this? You sure? I didn't play Battlefront. You need me to explain

403
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:16,069
this? You can't get that from me. I don't have one minute in Battlefront. I need to apologize for

404
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:30,630
this. You were 30 when you tweeted this. No. You just did the same thing. You just did the same

405
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:36,869
fucking thing. This doesn't work. This does not work because you did the same exact thing. It did

406
01:21:36,869 --> 01:21:50,979
not change at all. This doesn't work. Paul, the only thing that happened was I was ready for the

407
01:21:50,979 --> 01:21:58,250
picture on the left one and I wasn't ready for the picture on the right one. This is like the

408
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:03,380
30 selfies you take and then you delete 28 of them and you pick the one that you're like, wait,

409
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:12,010
whoa, I look like a fucking weirdo in that one. You know just how much your face can fucking change

410
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:18,470
in, here's an experiment. Okay. So we're going to do this. Here's an experiment. What I'd like

411
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:22,390
you to do is we're going to, remember, I remember I'm taking selfies of myself over the course of

412
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:26,949
three or four seconds. I would like for whoever wants to do this to take a frame, every frame of

413
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:34,180
this, and we'll go over them and we're going to see how shitty half of them look. Are you ready?

414
01:22:34,180 --> 01:23:04,550
Here we go. Click, click, click. Okay. So at least 40 of those 50 frames were terrible.

415
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:27,579
They were terrible. Every frame is bad. Why are my eyes so huge? What? You have big, I've got big

416
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:55,819
fucking eyes. There's no filter on. T minus hour and 40 minutes. I know, I know, I know, I know,

417
01:23:55,819 --> 01:24:13,260
I know, I know. Alita Battle Angel. They're not that big. That looks nice. That didn't even look

418
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:29,560
good. All right. Look at me. I know everything about paving. That looks good. Yeah, that looks

419
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:39,770
good. All right. That's fine. Somebody just said you're surprised that I know what Alita

420
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:50,630
Battle Angel is. Do you think that, okay, so after every stream, after every single fucking stream,

421
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:56,170
there's just sand outside and I just, I'm like, all right, I'm done with the broadcast today.

422
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:27,560
It's been swell. Okay. Good night, everybody. And then 12 hours go by. Oh, fuck. That looked really bad.

423
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:35,270
It looked like it was fake. Oh, fucking god damn it.

424
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:46,409
Stop playing. We're in it. No, we got an hour and a half left of this particular broadcast.

425
01:25:46,409 --> 01:25:53,960
We're all in at this point. I'm making at least one more duck. Worst hair, worst hair. Fuck. It's

426
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:59,640
all right. Whatever. It's not going to win. Don't worry. I'll have a greasy ass head in like four

427
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:06,310
months. What is this? What, do you guys think that changing the game is going to change what's

428
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:12,170
going on in the chat now and what the stream is derailed into? This is not, this is what we're

429
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:31,510
doing. Why can I not open this image? It's Bill and Ted hair. Wait, somebody, wait, what? Bill and Ted?

430
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:39,060
Why could I not, I can't even connect to the internet. Does somebody have a comparison?

431
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:54,739
Bill and Ted. Why can I not connect to the fucking internet? Am I stream still on? I can't open up

432
01:26:54,739 --> 01:27:25,720
any of these links because it's on, is Discord having problems? Nice link, dude. What? This is,

433
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:41,500
what the fuck is this? You swapped my eyes? Hold on. Let's go. I need to go over this. So this is

434
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:55,640
normal eyes. Hold on. Normal. Right eye and right eye. What? Who looks better?

435
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:10,439
This is left and left. Left and left doesn't look good. And this is eyes swapped. Which one looks the

436
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:17,829
best? All right. Bottom right and bottom left look fucking awful. Top right, I think looks the best

437
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:26,060
to me. What do you think? Oh, okay. If we're going to, if we're going to rate these on like on order,

438
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:34,260
okay. Number one is top right. Number two is top left. No, all right. Fourth eye swapped is number

439
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:40,409
three. And at the bottom is left. And my left eye is not the strong eye, huh? This eye is not the

440
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:54,539
strong one. Look what top right is looking. I don't get it. Left and left is himbo germa.

441
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:41,500
No comments. What do you mean no comments? Where's kitty floss?

442
01:29:41,500 --> 01:31:10,949
Oh god damn it. It's like the same face. It's the same, the same energy is coming off of these images.

443
01:31:10,949 --> 01:31:35,770
Same actor. Okay, that's enough. I'm done with this. Grow a beard? I can't grow a beard.

444
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:40,890
You think I can grow a beard? This is the extent of what I'm capable of. You don't want to get it

445
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:45,130
up close and personal here. You're gonna see all my nose hairs. They need to be trimmed. They're very,

446
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:50,859
very long. They're very long. You don't want to see them. I don't want to get that close so you

447
01:31:50,859 --> 01:31:58,250
can see them and you can count how many. No, no, I haven't had time to do any trimming or any any

448
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:08,100
any of this stuff. There's a spider on the ceiling. Oh wow. There's a spider on the ceiling.

449
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:39,399
Get a hold of this guy. What the fuck am I doing? I just like stopped. Did you see that? You just

450
01:32:39,399 --> 01:32:46,329
watched the train leave the station on camera. It just like I was just here. I stopped. It was

451
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:57,930
like the eye halted. It was like his brain was empty. All right, time to fill my brain with

452
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:05,619
knowledge. What was I doing? I have no fucking, oh this has been no experience gained. Nothing's

453
01:33:05,619 --> 01:33:12,779
happened and I've and we're like halfway through the stream. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

454
01:33:12,859 --> 01:33:20,010
wait a minute. I gave them funny hats. So that's excuse me. This dude's high as a kite. I'm not

455
01:33:20,939 --> 01:33:27,619
at all. Why are they all hanging out over here? Why have none of them been eaten yet?

456
01:33:29,829 --> 01:33:49,859
I feel like this is one of the Muppets. Next resident sleeper. There is no next. There's a

457
01:33:49,859 --> 01:33:57,770
next tomorrow. There's an Ikaruga tomorrow. Not right now. Let me at least do the one thing I

458
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:07,340
wanted to do. Please, please. And that one thing was, okay, I got the two ducks. They need to eat

459
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:19,340
crabs. I need a crab. I need a surfboard. First of all, Odama tomorrow. I need to say this on

460
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:24,220
camera because people don't would just apparently don't want to get this solidified into their

461
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:38,390
brains. I will, why am I blinking so much? I will never play Odama the GameCube ever again. Okay,

462
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:53,529
I need a house. I need to get a mouse house. We have, uh, I need these two birds are still

463
01:34:53,529 --> 01:35:03,449
hanging. They've been sleeping for like four days. Let me go to, I need a gecko. That's what I want.

464
01:35:03,449 --> 01:35:15,109
Gecko. Go get one. That's the ice place. Go to the desert. Actually get a gecko. That's what I want.

465
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:22,859
A kitty floss. Will they have to show up? Is a gecko in your mailbox? Well, I'm going to get two of

466
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:38,739
them. You missed like three. Show webcam. We want to see your face. Show webcam. I'd recommend that.

467
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:42,979
I don't like the, I don't like the frog that talks. It takes away my version. I give them

468
01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:49,300
their own voices. Like for me, that's like, not like this. You know what I mean? It's like,

469
01:35:49,300 --> 01:36:05,609
oh, it's fucked it all up for me. Okay. We need to get bait. Uh, come get it. I'll get two.

470
01:36:05,609 --> 01:36:15,689
Voice is wrong. We demand orange. We demand orange. There we go. This is exactly what I was

471
01:36:15,689 --> 01:36:55,130
talking about. This is the exact thing. Yep. Why do they all look like this? Why do all the

472
01:36:55,130 --> 01:37:01,020
paintings from like the 13th century, 14th, why do they look like that? That's how people looked.

473
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:12,090
What? This is not even, you just like made my nose a little more bulby. But this is, what the

474
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:21,380
fuck even is this? I'm going to show this on stream. Yeah. And that's not even an edit. That's just me

475
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:32,390
going like, ah, let's head back. Now let's make the geckos happy. Very happy. Did I bump you? I'm

01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:42,439

477
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:55,270
Sorry. I have to do this every time. Some of you guys weren't here yesterday. Some of you guys

478
01:37:55,270 --> 01:38:00,869
weren't here yesterday. There's a thing, talk about the mouth flap hitting hard and it's chasing you

479
01:38:00,869 --> 01:38:12,619
in a nightmare. This is like literally yesterday. I had a dream last night. It was crazy. It had

480
01:38:12,619 --> 01:38:18,039
something to do with Twitch. What was it? Oh my God. What was it? I remember I was like, ah, maybe

481
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:28,279
I should fucking like say something about this. Fuck. What was it? I don't remember. Damn it.

482
01:38:28,279 --> 01:38:39,029
Yes. A little gecky. Okay. Now how do I get you to stay? You need to eat a flutter scotch. There's two

483
01:38:39,029 --> 01:38:52,329

484
01:38:52,329 --> 01:39:03,380
just flying around? I need to put a light in the garden. You got it. How do I get that from that

485
01:39:03,380 --> 01:39:27,449
store? This is like when the, this is like the part of the movie where the caveman guy comes into

486
01:39:27,449 --> 01:39:31,369
society and they're trying to teach him how to count to 10 and they're trying to teach him numbers

487
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:37,420

Extra pepperoni. Okay. But you can't say circle, huh?

01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:43,220
Where's the flutter thing? There it is. That's an ad for Domino's.

Whatever. You eat Domino's. Eat it. It's fucking down. It's all right.

Do the whole scream in that voice. No. What? Oh, Chadbird incoming. Chadbird incoming.

502
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:19,369
I need three corns. Oh, that's not Chadbird. Did I lose the gecko again? I need to bring in...

503
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:24,170
What do they need? This and something else. Let me take a look at the encyclopedia. Let me actually

504
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:37,579
learn. Hulk waiting room. You're gonna be waiting for a little while. When can we expect a movie?

505
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:49,699
When can you expect me to make a movie? Okay. White flutter. Does it matter? White flutter scotch.

506
01:43:51,739 --> 01:43:57,000
Okay. Up here I have one daisy in the garden. No, it's the other ones. It's a regular one,

507
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:03,000
right? When are you doing the chocolate factory tour? Guys, we thought... We brought this up

508
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:11,000
yesterday afternoon. It's not just like, okay, time to go to the chocolate factory and broadcast

509
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:24,390
from a chocolate factory. How do I make the regular flutter thing show up? It was... I need...

510
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:34,359
What was it? It was the... It was the torches and what? Do that tomorrow. I can't go... All right.

511
01:44:34,359 --> 01:44:48,520
That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Mods. Mods. Start mods. Oh, okay. There's one.

512
01:44:48,520 --> 01:45:00,970
But how do I get the other ones? You all right? Oh, you're on fire. Here. What are you doing?

513
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:10,390
Backgammon waiting room. I don't know how to play backgammon. You're going to be waiting

514
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:23,340
forever. I... How? I need ducks, but they need to eat crabs. All right. I'm getting a cat.

515
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:35,939
I'm just buying one. Can I buy a cat? I don't... I don't know how to play backgammon.

516
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:50,600
I don't have any money. I can't even buy one. Gekko was a resident already. I don't see him.

517
01:45:50,600 --> 01:46:04,020
Where? I want to hear a story. I don't really have many stories. Where's the Gekko that's the

518
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:20,039
resident? I don't see a resident Gekko. Oh, yes. Okay. Now what do you need? I need to eat a moth

519
01:46:20,039 --> 01:46:26,899
drop. All right. You'll stick around though. Look at how cute he is. I knew people were going to do

520
01:46:26,899 --> 01:46:30,949
resident Gekko with the resident sleeper. I knew you were going to do that. All right. It's time

521
01:46:30,949 --> 01:46:43,640
to start selling people. Sell. Sell. Sell all the birds. Sell the birds and sell the bird.

522
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:52,329
If you're not a duck, then I'm going to sell you. Play Resident Evil 4. I'm going to.

523
01:46:53,130 --> 01:47:05,130
I'm gonna play Resident Evil 4. Just not in the next 20 minutes. Good. Now I need a Gekko house.

524
01:47:15,619 --> 01:47:22,020
Ooh, cool. Somebody said Resident Evil 4 sucks. Do you guys understand there's no way I could ever

525
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:28,039
make all of you happy? Even if a majority of you guys want to see Resident Evil 4, somebody just

526
01:47:28,039 --> 01:47:38,039
said Resident Evil 4 sucks. You know what I mean? Like, what do you want me to do? Pizza. Pizza.

527
01:47:38,039 --> 01:47:43,850
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Take off your shirt. And that person actually for like at least five

528
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:59,060
minutes. All right. I need to do Gekko house. We're going to put it over here. Where's the door?

529
01:48:00,359 --> 01:48:08,569
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Take off your glasses.

530
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:55,670
Fuck. I hate this. I hate this. But I'm going to show it anyways. I hate this. Build it. All right.

531
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:59,270
That looks good. I'm going to buy a couple more of these. I'm going to buy like four or five

532
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:03,029
watercresses and put them along the edge here. Do I have enough money for that?

533
01:49:03,029 --> 01:49:09,670
Do a voice. I can't do. Oh, fuck. He's on fire. Why the hell burning?

534
01:49:15,319 --> 01:49:18,680
I think we have to be careful. We have some more. Hold on. I think I get it. Just give me a minute.

535
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:31,050
I think that I like, I think that we can maybe get some quality entertainment here school.

536
01:49:31,050 --> 01:49:33,609
Oh, yes.

537
01:49:36,810 --> 01:49:41,689
Like maybe we should stop streaming school. I think maybe that's a good idea.

538
01:49:49,779 --> 01:49:53,859
Don't say I didn't fucking try. Come back soon and try again.

539
01:49:53,859 --> 01:50:25,529
Okay. Scooby-Doo isn't a Yoda horse. Um, what the fuck are you talking about?

540
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:36,340
Yes, he is. Scooby-Doo is can be absolutely described as a Yoda horse.

541
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:55,779
Are you serious? Yes. Are you kidding me? It's true. Why are you don't you? Yeah, you can't.

542
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:02,819
Yeah, like, like, like, I almost got it. I'm close. I'm really,

543
01:51:02,819 --> 01:51:05,220
if you give me like four or five hours in the mirror tonight, I'll get it.

544
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:13,079
I've never tried that before. Don't I have another gecko?

545
01:51:23,659 --> 01:51:28,920
Please buy a milk bottle. People happy. Kitty floss. I'm crying. There's not going to be a

546
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:34,199
kitty floss because there are no kitty flosses that care about my house. They don't care about

547
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:48,229
this place. Oh, look, a Gekki. Eat that right there. Right there. There is no, that's a fox.

548
01:51:48,229 --> 01:51:52,840
This is a fox. I don't want one of these. I had them last time right there. I see one. No,

549
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:59,220
you don't. That's a lie. Oh my God. You're not a liar. Okay. Come here. How do I do this?

550
01:51:59,220 --> 01:52:15,300
Direct a mouse over here. Come here. Oh shit. He's going to eat it. Yeah. Now I have two geckos for

551
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:19,319
residents and I'm going to give them hats. Stop eating this food before you get, I'm going to

552
01:52:19,319 --> 01:52:48,340
sell you if you don't cut the shit. Break the shit. Break the shed. Break the shed. Wait,

553
01:52:48,340 --> 01:53:02,020
isn't that from Courage? Cowardly Dog? Return. What is it? Return the slab. Return the slab.

554
01:53:04,439 --> 01:53:23,609
Super dog. Yes, Gekki 2. All right. Let me see what the house looks like. Oh, Courage. Be careful

555
01:53:23,609 --> 01:53:30,439
out there. Don't go out too late at night. You're putting too much effort into this dumb dog.

556
01:53:31,159 --> 01:53:47,859
Oh, does she have an Irish accent? I don't know. She doesn't? She's Scottish. Oh, well,

557
01:53:47,859 --> 01:54:09,560
this is nice. Look at this place. How is this a gecko house? Okay. Now for them to, I have two.

558
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:21,159
They both need to eat a moth drop. How do I get a moth drop to come stay? Permanently. Let's look

559
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:32,439
it up. This is a baby game. Play Dead or Alive. Does anybody actually play that game? Like,

560
01:54:32,439 --> 01:54:40,600
do people play that game? Isn't that a fighting game? Did they just give up and just start making

561
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:53,689
fucking like beach simulations? Do they still make Dead or Alive the fighting game? Isn't it good?

562
01:54:53,689 --> 01:55:08,199
Isn't Dead or Alive a good game? Like fighting game wise? Isn't it like a good game? It was.

563
01:55:08,199 --> 01:55:15,779
The old ones are pretty good. Yeah. I'm just saying what I've heard. All right. I don't think

564
01:55:15,779 --> 01:55:26,060
I even have any info. How do I attract one? There we go. Moth drop. Peer requirements. Night time

565
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:32,869
in the garden. All right. But have a light in the garden. Night time in the garden.

566
01:55:32,869 --> 01:55:48,199
How do I make you stay? Wait for night time. Play Dead or Alive. I'm not, I don't play fighting games.

567
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:54,229
No, I don't play them. It's not even just like, oh, I don't stream that. I, that, it's just not.

568
01:55:54,229 --> 01:56:02,119
I just don't. All right. There's a moth drop right here. Has eaten one bluebell flower. Here we go.

569
01:56:02,119 --> 01:56:22,380
Check this out. Bluebell flower. Plant them. Put a couple here right in their spot that they like.

570
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:32,840
Well, this is so POG. This is an, this is a POG only stream. Okay. I'll do fertilizer on these.

571
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:45,060
Does it matter? Just blue fertilizer, right? Kind of POG, I guess. POG only. So let's do a fertilizer.

572
01:56:45,699 --> 01:56:51,619
Plant a bunch of shit and then get a bunch of fertilizer. What should I do first? Plant first,

573
01:56:51,619 --> 01:56:58,579
then fertilizer. Was it fertilize first and plant or plant then fertilize? Fertilizer goes on

574
01:56:58,579 --> 01:57:10,340
afterwards, right? I know. Like you, you smeared my face up a little bit. God, I'm so, okay.

575
01:57:11,079 --> 01:57:14,840
Very on POG of you. I hope the same people doing Resident Sleeper do the same thing for

576
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:21,430
Animal Crossing. People happy. Um, I think that half the people doing that are doing it because

577
01:57:22,069 --> 01:57:27,369
they just, they, they just want to cause chaos. They just want constant fucking conflict.

578
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:36,979
I know. I saw it. I saw it. It's fertilizer after, right? We're doing, we need bluebell.

579
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:57,779
Do I not have it in my bag? Fuck. Ah, mean flower. Just watch Family Guy funny moments. Why would I

580
01:57:57,779 --> 01:58:12,100
do that right now? Why would I watch Family Guy funny moments? There's no reason for me to do that.

581
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:16,699
All right. I need bluebell flowers. We need to feed these people and then they're going to go

582
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:20,539
and they're going to, we're going to have gecko. They're going to have gecko babies.

583
01:58:23,300 --> 01:58:39,319
Watch TikTok compilation. All right. Fertilizer and seeds. I need seeds first, then fertilizer.

584
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:47,850
No, no, no. I mean, where's bluebell? I don't even have access to this shit. Bluebell.

585
01:58:49,829 --> 01:58:58,260
You need to react. Uh, what I need to do is, holy shit, he's zooming around. You see that? Look at

586
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:14,260
them. Look at how fast they're running. Well, don't touch it then. Don't touch the fire. What

587
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:26,010
are you stupid? All right. Here we go. Plant. Fertilize. Action. I'm going to play my favorite

588
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:32,170
game. All right. On sub. Good morning. Can I interest you in something seedy? No, I don't mean

589
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:36,869
like that. That's, that's what you could title this stream. I could just change the title of

590
01:59:36,869 --> 01:59:40,949
this stream to Jerma play the game I like or on sub. I could just change. I could be the title

591
01:59:40,949 --> 02:00:08,729
today. All right. We need blue fertilizer. Fertilize. Fertilization. Didn't get this one,

592
02:00:08,729 --> 02:00:22,659
did I? Yep. What about this one over here? Did I get this one? Yep. Okay. Water. He's not playing

593
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:36,359
farming simulator. I am. I am going to lose it. A monkey Island. I am going to lose it.

594
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:46,979
Play Toho. Until like four days ago. I didn't even know what that was.

595
02:00:49,420 --> 02:01:08,500
It's, can I, give me a second. It's really good. All right. It's like, wait, why can I not do this

596
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:23,739
anymore? Wait, here they go. All right. Blue Bells are up. This is like you recommended a movie.

597
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:31,699
Hey man, you should really go see Star Wars, Return of Skywalker. Okay. Yeah, that sounds

598
02:01:31,699 --> 02:01:35,380
like a good movie. Maybe I'll check it out eventually. Maybe I'll do it. Yeah, I'll probably

599
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:41,319
watch it. No, go right now. I don't want to go watch the new Star Wars movie right now.

600
02:01:41,319 --> 02:01:48,199
I've got some stuff to do. No, go right now or I'm not your friend anymore. Can I just give me a

601
02:01:48,199 --> 02:01:53,479
couple of days to figure out? I got to look at movie times. No, there's one playing at 5 30. Go

602
02:01:53,479 --> 02:01:58,760
now. Here, let me help you. And you start like pushing me out of my house. Let me help you.

603
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:04,279
Just go out there. You open the car door. Get in. I don't want to go see the movie right now. Get

604
02:02:04,279 --> 02:02:10,600
in and drive the car now. All right, fine. Jesus. And then you stand there like so like you stand

605
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:16,859
there straight in the air like a pencil till I come back. And I get out. I'm finally, I'm like,

606
02:02:16,859 --> 02:02:22,630
God, I get back in the movie. You're still there. Like, and I pulled the car into the fucking

607
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:28,729
driveway and that the lights hit you and you're fucking still there standing staring. And then

608
02:02:28,729 --> 02:02:36,659
the door opening was that best movie you ever seen your life? Um, well, I yeah, I know. I like

609
02:02:36,659 --> 02:02:39,460
the two. It was my favorite movie ever seen my whole life. That's your favorite movie you've

610
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:48,819
ever seen your whole life, right? Sure. I thought it was great. Cool. What do you do tomorrow? Um,

611
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:57,239
I don't know, man. You should go see this movie. I'll stand here. I'll be ready. I tried to kill it

612
02:02:57,239 --> 02:03:08,899
in time. Did I get it? I did. Can you stop with the movie recommendations?

613
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:26,279
Never. He hates it. Why were you friends with person in the first place?

614
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:45,300
Why were you friends with this person in the first place? Because they were a pretty normal guy

615
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:58,300
until the subject of movies came up. Kitty, please. I can't. Look, the kitty is going to come

616
02:03:58,300 --> 02:04:12,569
eat. The kitty is going to come eat a bug if the kitty wants to. Oh crap. I still can't get a surf

617
02:04:12,569 --> 02:04:23,430
board. Here we go. All right. Where's uh, where's my, where's my gecko friends? Four daisies in the

618
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:33,350
garden. Oh fuck. You should play Roblox. And that's another one, right? Like Roblox is so

619
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:39,689
much shit. It's like the Roblox is not like the game Roblox. It's the infrastructure Roblox. And

620
02:04:39,689 --> 02:04:43,449
I've seen that often too. And that's the equivalent of not telling me to go see a specific movie.

621
02:04:43,449 --> 02:04:50,060
That's telling me to go just spend my whole day in the movie theater, right? And just, hey, can

622
02:04:50,060 --> 02:05:09,750
you like pick a cool movie to watch in the movie theater? I, I guess. What do you do? You're not

623
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:16,170
even, you gotta live here, man. Go watch all the Star Wars movies. All right. I need to wait till

624
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:30,140
nighttime. Are these ready to be harvested? Choo, choo, choo. Honda. Chota. Chota. Chota. Honda.

625
02:05:31,340 --> 02:05:47,579
Choo, choo, choo. Choo, choo, choo. Let's get some info here. Okay. He's eating one moth drop.

626
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:54,920
I gotta get the moth drops to show up. He never went back to that game. Yeah. Cause I bought like

627
02:05:54,920 --> 02:06:02,500
a bootleg copy of it and it fucked up. Do I have my sneeze button still? Uh, I don't know. What is

628
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:15,189
this one? What's that doing? No, I don't. Actually it's gone. That's sad. All right. Here we go.

629
02:06:16,180 --> 02:06:26,539
Here come the moth drops. Eat these bells. Hurry, hurry. I'm only 400 pounds. Hurry, feed me,

630
02:06:26,539 --> 02:06:51,939
feed me more. I'm only 350 pounds. I think that's the, the thing in the arcade from like 20 years

631
02:06:51,939 --> 02:07:08,739
ago that then you throw the balls in the lady's mouth and she gets fatter. Come on. What? I'm under

632
02:07:08,739 --> 02:07:13,449
wifi. Something like that. Yeah. All right. Where are the fuck are these moths? Look at, I got

633
02:07:13,449 --> 02:07:22,970
everything they want right here. You promised me a kitty. I can't unless the kitty decides to come

634
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:29,960
over here and eat one of the mice. I'm trying to make the geckos do the gecko dance cause I

635
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:44,939
want to see it. Cause that game used to terrify me as a kid. Yeah. It, yeah. It was fucking crazy.

636
02:07:45,579 --> 02:07:51,020
Check its visit requirements. Yeah. It needs blue. It needs these bells and needs these lights.

637
02:07:51,100 --> 02:08:03,539
This is nighttime. So where is it? Excuse me. Are you here yet? Moth drop. Eat a blue bell flower.

638
02:08:03,539 --> 02:08:25,500
Look what's over here. Eat it. Yes. No, wrong image. Uh, yes. This, uh, it's big Bertha.

639
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:29,659
And what you would do is you would throw balls into this. There was a little ball thing that was

640
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:36,140
underneath down here and it was like the little tray and you had to throw the balls into her mouth

641
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:41,500
and there was an inflatable thing underneath where her, where her shirt is. And every time

642
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:53,689
you put another ball, a ball went in, it would inflate a little more until a big got huge.

643
02:08:53,689 --> 02:09:00,149
And, and points were weight. And every time you'd get like two or three, four or five balls in,

644
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:04,859
she'd say like, I'm only 200 pounds. I can be much fatter than this. And then it'd be like,

645
02:09:04,859 --> 02:09:08,460
I'm only, you'd cut it off sometimes. So if you, if you had like three or four friends all doing it

646
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:11,979
at the same time that you did, it was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It'd be

647
02:09:11,979 --> 02:09:17,300
like, I'm only, I'm only three. I'm free. I'm 400. I'm only 500 pounds. You can do better.

648
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:22,439
And then the timer would run out and then she would laugh. And then you'd put

649
02:09:22,439 --> 02:09:28,170
25 cents in and you would do it again until you were out of money. And then you'd go buy

650
02:09:28,170 --> 02:09:37,739
four tootsie rolls at the counter with the tickets you won. Did I get a moth drop yet?

651
02:09:37,819 --> 02:09:53,260
Bingo. Bingo. Do it. Please. Eat one of these. Eat one. Yeah.

652
02:10:08,699 --> 02:10:19,109
All right, go. Now we have our resident moth drop. We need another one. And then we can feed

653
02:10:19,109 --> 02:10:31,590
the geckos. He's still playing piñata. Yeah. I mean, for now, for now. Yeah. And I'm probably

654
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:36,619
not going to play this tomorrow. I just want to make a couple more geckos. I'm playing

655
02:10:36,619 --> 02:10:49,800
Icaruga tomorrow. Oh, they're actually kind of cool looking. He hates the piñata. He hates

656
02:10:49,800 --> 02:11:11,159
the piñata. No, no. You hate the piñata. You hate the piñata. Not me. These still need to be

657
02:11:11,159 --> 02:11:19,579
a plant dried out. What? Stop fucking touching this. You're going to get hurt. Come here.

658
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:31,500
All right. Now I need another moth drop. You need to eat one of these moth drops, but not yet.

659
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:35,449
I need another moth drop, two moth drops. We're going to have moth drops and then we're going to

660
02:11:35,449 --> 02:11:41,609
have a gecko baby. Why are your lips so red? They're not. They're not. The white balance on

661
02:11:41,609 --> 02:11:48,090
this camera is tilted to a point where it's all red. My eyes are red though, because I've only

662
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:52,090
slept like two or three hours a night for the last five straight days, but that's accurate.

663
02:11:56,899 --> 02:12:05,800
Patch here. Where am I needed? I'm ready for healing and stuff. That's an exaggeration.

664
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:10,699
It's probably been like four. It's probably been like four hours a night, maybe four and a half.

665
02:12:10,699 --> 02:12:31,539
Oh my God. A liar. It's maybe like three or four plus maybe four and a half or stop streaming and

666
02:12:31,539 --> 02:12:44,199
go to bed. I'm fine. I'm all right. I've like, I've had four plus hours a night. Oh, there's six,

667
02:12:44,199 --> 02:13:02,890
six to ten. Turn off the torches, please. The piñatas are burning. Bluebell. Dink, dink, dink.

668
02:13:02,890 --> 02:13:16,729
All right. I'll turn the torches off. He sleeps 18 hours a day. He'd probably puke. If I slept

669
02:13:16,729 --> 02:13:27,720
for 18 hours more than, I'd probably throw up. I'd wake up and I'd feel like shit and I'd probably

670
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:39,750
puke. Turn around, you bad streamer. Oh, here. Look, I can't, there, I can't do anything about

671
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:56,550
this. They have to come eat a mouse. Look, he doesn't even want to come over here. Bad. He

672
02:13:56,550 --> 02:14:01,210
doesn't want to come over here. He has to eat a mouse mallow. He doesn't want to come over here.

673
02:14:01,210 --> 02:14:11,689
Buy milk. Oh my God. Go buy milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk. All right,

674
02:14:11,689 --> 02:14:17,300
get milk. Cats aren't supposed to fucking drink milk. Birds aren't supposed to eat bread.

675
02:14:17,859 --> 02:14:33,899
This is ridiculous. This is a thousand dollars. Uh, no. Uh, you want to spend a thousand fucking

676
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:50,020
dollars on milk. Can I, I can't sell you. You don't, you don't, you don't live here.

677
02:14:55,340 --> 02:15:14,600
Selling a mouse and selling two mice. No, I'm not. Fuck. I don't, I can't sell anything. I don't

678
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:24,579
have any money. Let me do it. I don't. Uh, fine. I'll sell a mouse. Fine. Get back in there and buy

679
02:15:24,579 --> 02:15:48,970
that milk. It's a thousand dollars. Sell the seeds. Where is he? Where's this weirdo? March

680
02:15:48,970 --> 02:15:56,170
in there and get that milk. I can't until I have a thousand dollars. There goes the cat. No, no,

681
02:15:56,170 --> 02:16:14,390
no, no. I want the cat. No. Oh, moth drop. I'm so mad. Look, he's pretending to fly.

682
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:22,550
Did you see that? He had his arms out and he has the, the helmet on. Oh yeah. He's mocking us.

683
02:16:23,619 --> 02:16:36,069
Was I? I don't think, I don't think I was. You won't come here without a surfboard.

684
02:16:36,069 --> 02:16:42,440
Okay. How about, um, I need to sell. I'm just going to sell.

685
02:16:44,360 --> 02:16:50,549
Uh, I have to sell a mouse. That's just what's going to have to happen. I'm selling a mouse

686
02:16:50,549 --> 02:17:03,670
and I'm going to sell a couple of flowers. Make an OnlyFans account. How would I do that?

687
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:11,340
Oh, I don't have a reason to do that. I'm selling a mouse. You and I'm going to sell some of these

688
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:37,799
flowers. Daisy. All right. I need five, nine, 70, 981. Okay. I can get the milk. I'm not going to

689
02:17:37,799 --> 02:17:43,239
buy it yet until the cat comes back. I'm supposed to get distracted. I've been distracted for almost

690
02:17:43,239 --> 02:17:54,469
two and a half straight hours. I've, I've been distracted for as long as a, a like Christopher

691
02:17:54,469 --> 02:18:24,340
Nolan movie. Okay. So we, I can start to play now. All right. We're looking for more moth drops.

692
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:44,540
Turn these on. Back away from this. Back away. Back away. Back away. Back away. You're going to get,

693
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:51,690
whatever. Attention. Attention. Look at me. Attention. Okay. Cool.

694
02:18:55,270 --> 02:19:00,790
It's worth showing this one. It's worth showing this. This is great. This is very good.

695
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:10,739
This is my favorite of the whole night. I think this is very, very good.

696
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:45,420
Any more moth drops. Come eat and then I'll, I can make the geckos breed. This one's better. I

697
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:51,639
promise. Oh, that one. Whoa. Wow. That's way better. No, it's just, you, you, it's a smudge tool in

698
02:19:51,639 --> 02:20:09,930
Photoshop. You. Howdy doody. Howdy doody Hummer. Howdy doody Hummer. Howdy. No, I can't do that.

699
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:19,979
That's not, I'm not good enough. If you tuck it. That's different. What's that one? I don't think

700
02:20:19,979 --> 02:20:37,430
you. Oh, that's like, there's a bit. When my mask gets broken. I can't. How many do you have? All

701
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:42,229
right. What is this thing? This is a question mark, question mark, question mark. Mystery seed.

702
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:51,979
Let's try it. Where's it? What are you doing to plant it? Just right over here. It's a mystery seed.

703
02:20:53,430 --> 02:21:18,180
Let's check it out. It is a doesn't go. No. Gooseberry bush. Whatever. Fucking controls.

704
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:26,680
Fucking suck. Fucking controls. Stupid fucking controls. Hey, time to silent. Nobody's in my

705
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:32,680
room. Be mad at something. The fucking controls are fucking stupid. Dumbest fucking game ever,

706
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:46,059
man. Such a fucking stupid game. So fucking stupid. Fucking dumbest fucking thing ever.

707
02:21:48,920 --> 02:22:17,299
Fucking be in the game. Fucking. What is this? Is it a tree? Dude, it's a hazel tree.

708
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:38,040
Hmm. This thing take a lot of water. Nice and this. Um, hello? Look at how much water this shit takes.

709
02:22:39,579 --> 02:23:04,940
Fuck this. All right. Another one. The show was better than the game. Oh, squazzle. Oh, wait,

710
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:09,780
there's a hazelnut tree. That's how you get a squazzle. This game is fucking so bad.

711
02:23:11,620 --> 02:23:16,680
Why would anyone play this for more than five minutes? It's opposite day. Just kidding.

712
02:23:20,219 --> 02:23:27,530
Oh, fuck. Is that another one? What is this one? Is that too close? An apple tree. Oh, shit. Nice.

713
02:23:27,530 --> 02:23:38,069
Is this too close? Actually, that kind of look that look good. That look kind of good.

714
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:45,579
All right. What's the mystery one then? Just in case something big. I'll put it over here.

715
02:23:46,299 --> 02:24:00,250
Something dried out. Where? Oh, this shit takes a ton of water. Oh, gooseberry bush.

716
02:24:03,079 --> 02:24:28,649
I just walk into fire. These things take so much water. Holy shit. Stop walking into the fire.

717
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:50,309
Oh my. Aye. Okay. Well, I know what it looks like now. Big bits. Big bits. Fill this up with

718
02:24:50,309 --> 02:24:58,659
5,000. 5,000 bits from Titan Claws. 50 bucks. Thanks to the 50 fucking dollars, dude.

719
02:24:59,959 --> 02:25:05,659
And Titan Claws says, uh, girlfriend of five years broke up with me. Then my father passed

720
02:25:05,659 --> 02:25:10,940
away unexpectedly two days later. Holy shit. I'm so sorry. The past two and a half weeks have been

721
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:14,059
the worst of my life, but your streams and highlights have helped me more than you could

722
02:25:14,059 --> 02:25:27,479
know. Thank you. I'm really sorry to hear about that shit. That's pretty rough. Back to back

723
02:25:27,479 --> 02:25:39,299
like that. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. Try to keep your head up.

724
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:55,030
Hang in there, buddy. Yeah, for real. Because that's two, that's just two things back to back

725
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:59,590
that nobody wants to that shit to happen. Especially like that back to back like that.

726
02:26:06,459 --> 02:26:12,520
Let's hope when the page turns here, take as long as you need to grieve for all this stuff

727
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:20,819
that the page can turn. Thank you so much. It's completely unnecessary to give me this much money.

728
02:26:21,850 --> 02:26:35,059
Take care of yourself. I wish you the best. Thank you so much. And an award for, oh, did I level up

729
02:26:35,059 --> 02:26:48,299
finally? It took me like three hours to do that. Come on. Yes. Level 13. In no way unlucky, I hope

730
02:26:48,299 --> 02:26:56,469
Petula has a new wig and Lottie has three new items to dress up your garden. Most importantly,

731
02:26:56,469 --> 02:27:01,430
you can buy a new seed packet from Lottie that will give you more options in your garden.

732
02:27:01,430 --> 02:27:10,219
Because I wasn't doing anything. There it is. How many times do I have to get a shovel upgrade?

733
02:27:11,180 --> 02:27:22,920
You've reached the stage I got to on my third day. Well done. This makes your shovel stronger.

734
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:28,180
So you should be able to deal with some of the more awkward things in your garden. Thanks for

735
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:34,940
the info. I don't know what that means. Stupid idiot. Hi, these are all ready. This one needs

736
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:41,000
some water properly. Whoo. It's going. It's going. Attention. I'm not gonna say that.

737
02:27:43,479 --> 02:28:02,170
I know it's drying out. I'm trying. I'm working on it. Happy birthday. Cool. So we have,

738
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:11,610
we need to get them off. These ducks are still having fun. Having some fucking fun. Sick. Sell

739
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:21,579
you. And buy milk. Screamer. Attention. Buy milk. Buy milk. Milk, milk, milk, milk. You need milk

740
02:28:21,579 --> 02:28:31,799
for the cat. You need milk for the cat. You need milk for the cat. I know, I know, I know. There's

741
02:28:31,799 --> 02:28:58,459
no cat in sight. PS2 emulator slow down. Do you guys remember that shit? What game did I play on

742
02:28:58,459 --> 02:29:08,180
that PS2 emulator? It was that news one, right? Something with the CPU cycling was wrong. And it

743
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:15,750
kept going like that. Yeah. What was that? Michigan report from hell. Yeah. Didn't I beat that whole

744
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:32,010
game to putting up with all that crap? I was waiting for them to come in. I got the bad ending.

745
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:46,409
Whatever. Shit. Where'd that go? I gotta get rid of this. Where is it? It's in here. Get rid of it.

746
02:29:47,129 --> 02:29:56,409
Stop. I can't even select it. Tell it. Quick. It still needs water. All right. Time to turn

747
02:29:56,409 --> 02:30:09,100
this shit on. There's Mr. Cidos. Oh, I didn't even plant this. What is this one? Let's see what it

748
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:26,729
is. A tree? It is a tree, isn't it? It's a blackberry bush. How much water does it need?

749
02:30:27,450 --> 02:30:33,559
Or it's too much? That's probably good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. Looking

750
02:30:33,559 --> 02:30:40,379
for the moths. I need another moth. Are you a moth? No, you're an ant. I don't really care about the

751
02:30:40,379 --> 02:30:49,379
ant. Wait, they want to eat it? I think they want to eat this. Cat. The cat's not here. There's no

752
02:30:49,379 --> 02:30:57,299
cat. I can't get a cat. Cat has to come on its own when it wants to. There's no cat available. See,

753
02:30:57,299 --> 02:31:02,569
I looked all around the whole perimeter. No cats. There is. No, there's not. I don't see. There's no

754
02:31:02,569 --> 02:31:21,239
cat here. That's a fox. What are you doing over there? He's over there. Then find one. All right.

755
02:31:21,239 --> 02:31:28,569
I will find one. Just attention. 28 minutes remaining until the stream is over. I'll find one.

756
02:31:28,569 --> 02:31:37,559
I'll just have to... I'll get a... All I have to do is just find... Yeah, I'll get an upgrade for it.

757
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:57,479
Thermo monkey has thermo. 28 minutes. Oh, fuck. Is it really? Where are these fucking moths? You

758
02:31:57,479 --> 02:32:02,040
can't turn the stream off till we have the cat. That's fair. That's, that's fair. No, the stream

759
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:11,860
can't turn off till we get the cat and I breed the geckos. That's just the way it is. Where's this

760
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:33,959
bat? Attention. Use hunter. I can't use the hunter until I have a resident sleeper. Moth drop. All

761
02:32:33,959 --> 02:32:46,500
right. There's one. I need another moth drop. Moth drop two. Oh. Yep. Okay. Eat a blue. Eat a

762
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:59,079
flower. And then finally I can breed the geckos. Over here. Come over here. Check it out. Can you

763
02:32:59,079 --> 02:33:04,700
breed the moths? I think I can, but I got to see what it takes to do that. Come on. Come over here

764
02:33:04,700 --> 02:33:12,549
and eat one of these. Come over here. Come on. I know you want to do it before the time runs out.

765
02:33:12,549 --> 02:33:38,790
Please. No. Is it leaving? No. No. Don't leave. No. What the fuck? No, please don't test it.

766
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:57,450
Badgicle. Didn't we already know this? A badgicle has appeared. The garden has a blackberry bush.

767
02:33:57,450 --> 02:34:00,969
Then a badgicle won't be far behind. Didn't we already get introduced to a badgicle?

768
02:34:02,489 --> 02:34:06,329
Eat it. It's going to eat it. Come on. You're right there. Eat it so we can keep this going.

769
02:34:06,329 --> 02:34:14,459
Please just land on this and eat it. Come on. Do it. Why are you doing this? You're teasing me.

770
02:34:14,459 --> 02:34:29,110
You must be a chat member. Will you just eat it? Oh my god. Just eat it. You've already

771
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:33,770
have to fly around like this. Just eat this and then live here and then I can make a moth house

772
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:40,100
and then I can breed you and then we can breed the geckos. Eat that. Eat it. Please just eat it.

773
02:34:42,139 --> 02:35:06,020
Just eat it. Eat. Weird owl ripoff. That's a weird owl song. I'm singing the weird owl version. That's

774
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:10,899
not me singing that. That's a weird owl song. No, it's a Michael Jackson song. That then turned into

775
02:35:10,899 --> 02:35:14,979
a weird owl song. That then turned into me referencing a weird owl song which references

776
02:35:14,979 --> 02:35:34,700
the Michael Jackson song. Sorry. I win. Now I can build a moth drop house. Two moth drops.

777
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:41,579
Now what does it take for them to breed? Has to eat a hazelnut tree seed. Oh god. Do I just say

778
02:35:41,579 --> 02:35:55,909
fuck it? Hazelnut tree seed. Somebody just gave 5,000 bits again. Another one. What's with the

779
02:35:56,709 --> 02:36:08,340
all right turn this off. That's another 5,000 bits from phylactery lich phylactery. 50 bucks 5,000

780
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:15,219
fucking bits. Thanks for the huge amount of money as always. This is an actual important game tip.

781
02:36:15,219 --> 02:36:19,530
Okay. Thanks for the huge amount of money first of all. Second of all,

782
02:36:20,489 --> 02:36:25,370
once you breed a species the first time you can just go buy romance candy and feed it to them

783
02:36:25,370 --> 02:36:27,930
to make them breed again. You don't have to keep feeding them moth drops.

784
02:36:30,649 --> 02:36:42,979
Wow. Holy shit. Don't dig a pond. Well, thanks for the tip and now let's do that. Okay. So let's um

785
02:36:43,540 --> 02:37:07,829
you know what I mean? We're gonna look for a seed, right? No seeds are gonna fall. Fuck. Okay. So

786
02:37:07,829 --> 02:37:13,670
let's do romance candy. Wait. Let me read that again. Once you breed a species for the first

787
02:37:13,670 --> 02:37:27,620
time. All right. So just eat the moths. Where's my uh geckos? Gecko one. Eat this moth. Gecko two.

788
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:46,520
Where's gecko two? Gecko one. Gecko two. Eat moth one and then breed. Where's moth one? All right.

789
02:37:46,520 --> 02:38:03,700
Gecko two to moth one. Gecko two to moth one. Over. Where's moth one? Gecko two to moth one.

790
02:38:03,700 --> 02:38:26,549
This is big business. Um seriously. Where's the other moth? Is he in the house? Wait. What?

791
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:35,909
Moth. Eat moth. What are you afraid of? Where are they? I'm gonna start. I'm just gonna start

792
02:38:35,909 --> 02:38:41,719
massively selling. I'm just gonna sell a bunch of marshmallows. They're impeding on my gecko.

793
02:38:41,719 --> 02:39:09,049
Come here. Go eat this. Eat. Go for it. Got it. Wait. Don't both of you do it. Wait. Can you both

794
02:39:09,049 --> 02:39:14,620
just eat it together? It just dropped a peanut. Come on. Eat. Maybe they don't have. Maybe I'm

795
02:39:14,620 --> 02:39:25,930
gonna keep that one moth. Eat this candy. Come on. When? Really? This fucking squirrel is over here.

796
02:39:28,219 --> 02:39:46,600
Get out of here. It's not yours. Get out of here. It's not your food. All right. Where's moth? That's

797
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:54,170
not the right moth. Why do you not live here? Are you? Moth? No. This is not. This is not even the

798
02:39:54,170 --> 02:40:00,920
right one. Where is this motherfucker? Did somebody help me out here? Where's this other moth drop

799
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:14,309
that moved in on the sand building? Oh, I thought that was part of the fucking-

800
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:37,530
I thought that was part of the decor- the design. All right. Let's go. Eat. Eat. Eat. Apples and bananas.

801
02:40:38,649 --> 02:40:50,409
I like to eat. Eat. Eat. Apples and bananas. Oh, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you do

802
02:40:50,409 --> 02:40:58,489
baby bop and people fucking want to leave. Wow. Whoa. Unbelievable. You do the fucking

803
02:40:58,489 --> 02:41:18,549
Barney the Dinosaur character and everybody decides it's time to go now. He's actually mad.

804
02:41:19,350 --> 02:41:31,829
All right. Let's do it. Are you ready? Did you even eat yet? Eat. Dermot, you should be worried

805
02:41:31,829 --> 02:41:43,239
about the people that stay. What? He's view pandering. I just started singing the Apples

806
02:41:43,239 --> 02:41:46,520
and Bananas song from Barney the Dinosaur and then you think that's me pandering views.

807
02:41:53,610 --> 02:42:01,219
It's time to see what this sex thing is. What are you- are you saying that the audience is like

808
02:42:02,649 --> 02:42:18,500
10 years old? What is that thing? Sour Profitimel. You have attracted a sour profisimel, I'm sorry.

809
02:42:19,059 --> 02:42:25,059
Well, just hit him in the head with the fucking hammer, whatever this is. Hit him with the face

810
02:42:25,059 --> 02:42:40,360
of the shovel. He'll go away. Where is it? Are you guys ready to see the dance of the geckos?

811
02:42:41,079 --> 02:42:59,659
You ready? This is gonna be sick. Here it comes. We've been waiting two days for this. All right,

812
02:42:59,659 --> 02:43:19,860
let me see. So we go bottom. I don't know. Who cares? This is really hard to control. It is.

813
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:32,020
Trust me when I say that. This is very difficult to control this. It's very, very sloppy. Change

814
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:38,010
camera. You can now press the Y button at any time. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

815
02:43:38,809 --> 02:44:01,770
During the time, I'm fine. All right, let's see the dance. Let's go.

816
02:44:03,610 --> 02:44:07,159
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out,

817
02:44:07,159 --> 02:44:12,379
watch out. I gotta get back to the house. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. She's coming over. Oh my god.

818
02:44:12,379 --> 02:44:17,850
Oh no, no, no, no, no. I gotta make sure. Is the bed clean? Does the bed smell? Oh fuck. Is there

819
02:44:17,850 --> 02:44:24,120
trash in my fucking counter? Shit. Yeah, just one second. Throw it on the fucking ground and

820
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:37,979
push it in the corner. Where's the Febreze? All right, we're ready. Come on, come on in. Fuck.

821
02:44:37,979 --> 02:45:11,110
Come on in. I love this one. That was great. That was awesome. I want to see what the duck one is.

822
02:45:11,110 --> 02:45:29,129
So bad. What about this? Can we see the snake one at least? Egg delivered. Maybe we'll get to see

823
02:45:29,129 --> 02:45:46,149
the cat one. New seeds. A new pinata is in the desert? A new pinata has been spotted in the

824
02:45:46,149 --> 02:46:07,190
Keen Arctic. Let's go check it out. Wait, evil. You're my cursed dog PNG.

825
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:12,870
At last you have a shovel worthy of a real gardener. There isn't much you can't do with this now.

826
02:46:13,670 --> 02:46:19,510
See the jagged edge on this shovel? That's so you can cut down any tree that you don't need anymore.

827
02:46:21,129 --> 02:46:30,979
That's pretty cursed. You're right. Now all we need this to do is we need this to move. So the mouth

828
02:46:30,979 --> 02:46:34,420
is constantly moving forward and another head's coming out of the mouth. You know what I mean?

829
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:39,159
Like those weird images that just keep going forward at you. Or keep going backwards or

830
02:46:39,159 --> 02:46:57,540
whatever it is. That's a Jojo reference. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I just gave you a Jojo reference.

831
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:03,459
I'm waiting for him to come in. He'll come in in a second. Right when you cross that line,

832
02:47:03,459 --> 02:47:10,200
that's it. That's it. You crossed it. You crossed it. That's the line. You're off sides.

833
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:20,469
If only you'd stayed over there, I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have hit you.

834
02:47:22,569 --> 02:47:49,219
God, fuck. There's another one? What the fuck? This reminds me of a song. I want attention.

835
02:47:50,540 --> 02:48:00,409
Only 11 minutes remain in the stream. Only 11 minutes remain in the stream. I have no,

836
02:48:00,409 --> 02:48:09,239
what's wrong? Oh, I got it. My phone just started. Oh, I got a notification. Okay,

837
02:48:09,239 --> 02:48:11,719
I only have a little bit more time left. I got the notification.

838
02:48:18,389 --> 02:48:32,139
11. That's it? What the fuck? I thought I had more time than that. That's weird.

839
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:39,079
All right. Oh, what was I doing? I need that cat. A cat has to show up. Wait, isn't that a cat?

840
02:48:39,639 --> 02:48:43,219
This is a cat. This is your cat right here. No, it's not.

841
02:48:47,350 --> 02:49:07,479
Ooh, apples. He's not selfish very much. Just keep him. Hazelnut seed. Who wants one of these?

842
02:49:08,680 --> 02:49:29,450
Oh, there he is. He's so cute. Put a hat on Gekki. Yup. On a little Gekki. Absolutely. Whoa.

843
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:52,620
Fucking holy shit. Can I put it on? Do they have to be an adult? Yeah, they have to be an adult.

844
02:49:53,260 --> 02:50:15,479
Okay, what about for a hat? Anymore? Oh, there's new stuff. Hold on. I mean, perfect. Fireman,

845
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:32,629
right? Ooh, football helmet. Hmm. I think I want the bonnet. Or the fire helmet. Yeah, that's

846
02:50:32,629 --> 02:50:50,500
perfect. I love it. I love the eyes. Superhero mask. Eh. Eh. Nah. Nose. A gas mask? That doesn't even

847
02:50:50,500 --> 02:51:11,079
fit on his face. There's nothing more than these teeth. Funky. Ooh, a tie. Or a spiked collar. Okay,

848
02:51:11,079 --> 02:51:30,170
the collar is kind of cool. Or the tie. So I like the tie. Collar is cool too. I like the collar.

849
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:46,180
Sweat bands. What about shoes? Yep. But all of his feet are on the ground. All right, I like it.

850
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:55,000
We're good. Yeah, selling's good. Means you do most of the work. Won't say bye because-

851
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:03,139
Put a tie on the duck. Yup. Couldn't have thought of anything more perfect than what you just said.

852
02:52:04,549 --> 02:52:11,370
New resident. A taffy? When did I get a taffy? What? I need a taffy. What do I need this taffy?

853
02:52:11,370 --> 02:52:19,899
Somebody has to eat this, right? I think, what, a snake? Who eats the taffy? Burn it. Set the

854
02:52:19,899 --> 02:52:50,569
taffy on fire. Come here. Do it. Do it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Look at him. Oh no, I'm the

855
02:52:50,569 --> 02:53:12,790
fireman. I'll put you out. When do I have to, when do I put it out? There we go. There it is. A super

856
02:53:12,790 --> 02:53:26,620
taffy. Evil candy? A ruffian is on the way. Oh no, a ruffian is on the way. They're experts

857
02:53:26,620 --> 02:53:44,659
in spiteful destructive behavior. Okay, now sell. For 2,200 bucks. Done. Okay, now,

858
02:53:45,540 --> 02:54:03,079
hey, uh, hit him. I gotta hit him with the shovel. Um, I can't even hit him. I can't hit him. He just

859
02:54:03,079 --> 02:54:06,120
throws up a candy and leaves. What is it? I think there's a candy. I think I know what that candy

860
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:18,090
might do. 5,000 more bits from Filashulich. Holy shit. Another 50 fucking dollars. Feed a gooseberry

861
02:54:18,090 --> 02:54:27,450
to a duck for a special surprise. Yeah, but what does it do? Oh, thanks for the 100 bucks.

862
02:54:28,540 --> 02:54:39,959
Feed a gooseberry to a duck. Okay, let me, I'll do it. Do I get a super duck? All right, here's

863
02:54:39,959 --> 02:55:13,459
a gooseberry. Hey, you. Not into it? Not into it? Not into it? Yeah, that was blackberries. Oh,

864
02:55:14,790 --> 02:55:29,049
was it gooseberry? I gotta look at all this fruit. Okay, gooseberry. You.

865
02:55:29,850 --> 02:55:48,139
Eat that gooseberry right there. What does it do? Oh, it turns up in a squidward.

866
02:56:00,809 --> 02:56:10,760
God damn it. You know, there are some people like myself who can help you with your more mundane

867
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:16,219
tasks. For example, you should let a springling like me come water your plants for you. Oh,

868
02:56:16,219 --> 02:56:21,829
you do work for me. Good. But I'm worth it. You can find me an arfer in here if you want to take me

869
02:56:21,829 --> 02:56:36,409
arfer. No doubt. How many people live in this town? Seriously? Hello. If you have problems with

870
02:56:36,409 --> 02:56:41,450
garden visitors, we can make sure that only guests on the list get in. I'm just going to have a

871
02:56:41,450 --> 02:56:50,090
couple of drinks and I'll be ready for work. Welcome to level 16. This level has a new helper

872
02:56:50,090 --> 02:56:56,170
to make life easier. Lottie has some very special fencing, a new item, and a-

873
02:56:56,170 --> 02:57:06,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can buy the surfboard now.

874
02:57:07,559 --> 02:57:13,719
But I don't have a duck. I have a duck and like a juicy duck. They can't- can they breed together?

875
02:57:13,719 --> 02:57:26,579
Can I do that? Does it have to be duck and duck or can it be duck and juicy duck? Can I do that?

876
02:57:26,579 --> 02:57:40,969
No, I can't. It's got to be duck and duck. And now there's no other- just buy a duck.

877
02:57:40,969 --> 02:57:49,129
Should I sell juicy duck? That's a lot of money. But does juicy duck sleep in the same house

878
02:57:49,129 --> 02:58:03,610
as regular duck or do they need a juicy duck house? This is- no, okay. All right, I'm gonna

879
02:58:03,610 --> 02:58:13,799
buy a duck and then I'm gonna buy- okay, I have some things to buy. I need- I'm gonna buy another

880
02:58:13,879 --> 02:58:26,760
duck. It says goose. Goose. Okay, where's duck? $2,000 fucking dollars for express delivery.

881
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:33,110
Get the fuck out of here. Come on, man. Standard delivery. Yeah, thank you.

882
02:58:40,780 --> 02:58:50,200
You're leveled up. I know. We're looking for- we have the- all right, I think it's time- I

883
02:58:50,200 --> 02:58:55,399
can throw this- I can- I can cannon this Gekki, right? I think it's time to cannon the Gekki.

884
02:58:55,959 --> 02:59:12,090
Because I already- I have two. He's gonna go to the- have a party. Yeah, we haven't done this yet,

885
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:15,610
so we'll be able to send him to the party. Yeah, we're gonna get a lot of experience for this.

886
02:59:18,889 --> 02:59:32,440
Fire him away. Reward for sending to a party. Yes, more, more, more. Level 17? Where's my pop-up

887
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:43,459
window for 17? Juicy goose. Gekki 1 is ready for liftoff as well. Should we send Gekki 1 to the

888
02:59:43,459 --> 03:00:11,579
party? They come back, right? They come back. They come back. Send to the party. No, they come back.

889
03:00:11,579 --> 03:00:29,370
They're just going to the party. I'm gonna do- I'm gonna sell these things. Sell. Sell. No, don't sell

890
03:00:29,370 --> 03:00:53,590
this. Okay, sell. They do come back. Going to the party means you get your guts- what? Anytime

891
03:00:53,590 --> 03:00:57,750
these things are within two or three pixels of each other, or like 200 or whatever they are,

892
03:00:58,229 --> 03:01:04,899
it's so hard to select anything. There's napping in the game, and it just- it's very- it's wonky.

893
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:17,770
Cat alert. Milk time. I did promise before the stream ended that I was gonna go get a cat.

894
03:01:17,770 --> 03:01:33,559
Attention. Chat has detected cat. Milk. No, milk is not a vegetable. Milk is not a vegetable,

895
03:01:33,559 --> 03:01:47,079
as much as the American food pyramid would like for you to know and believe. Bone. 14 fucking

896
03:01:47,079 --> 03:02:28,860
hundred. This is so much money. You- I hope you like this. Get rid of this shit. Hey, fuck. Get

897
03:02:28,860 --> 03:02:48,899
out of here. Don't- Juicy goose. Don't eat that food. It's bad for you. Do not eat that food.

898
03:02:48,899 --> 03:02:54,420
Leave it alone. Don't touch it. Nobody touch this food. It's bad. Poisonous. What is this, a mushroom?

899
03:02:54,420 --> 03:03:19,750
What is this? Is this live? Oh, I don't know what it was. Okay, now these apples. Who needs to eat

900
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:25,959
one of these? Somebody has to eat one of these. Where's my duck? I need a crab too. I need a

901
03:03:25,959 --> 03:03:50,180
surfboard. Fuck. Okay, surfboard. Boys. Boys. No, there's woo-too train and woo-woo train. There's

902
03:03:50,180 --> 03:04:12,059
no- What do I get it? Garden item? Surfboard. There we go. All right, good. Now I can bring crabs in.

903
03:04:16,299 --> 03:04:45,100
Evil bat. I know. I see him. Go to the desert? I will after I get rid of evil bats. So I have

904
03:04:45,659 --> 03:04:53,579
two apples that I think I can- Attention. You have over five minutes of your eluded

905
03:04:53,579 --> 03:05:00,549
minutes allowed on stream. Each minute after this momentary interruption will cost the streamer

906
03:05:00,549 --> 03:05:13,780
$15 per minute. The clock is still here though. That should be fine. Got to text. I don't know

907
03:05:13,780 --> 03:05:16,979
who's texting me right now, but I'm getting noticed. I don't want to fucking even see it.

908
03:05:16,979 --> 03:05:46,950
I'm streaming. What the fuck? Where's a cat? Where's a crab? Oh, a duck. Fred, we're gonna- Oh,

909
03:05:46,950 --> 03:06:11,930
come here. Hey, come here. Make more goose. I can do two goose. The bread's in the water.

910
03:06:11,930 --> 03:06:31,620
Does it matter? I have another- My delivery is ready, right? Oh, super goose. Geese. It's geese.

911
03:06:31,620 --> 03:06:54,069
I know. There's a quackberry. Where? Collect? Yeah. Thank you. All right. Nope.

912
03:06:56,870 --> 03:07:03,590
Omega lol, two goose. Omega lol, two goose. I mean, you get it. Did you eat that bread yet?

913
03:07:04,149 --> 03:07:31,020
You didn't. Why? What am I doing? I'm waiting to tame a cat and I'm waiting for a crab to show up.

914
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:46,170
When a crab shows up, I can breed the ducks, play Lisa the Painful. What on earth? What? All right,

915
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:51,700
we're gonna get the camera off of this one. I probably will never play Lisa the Painful on this

916
03:07:51,700 --> 03:08:07,819
stream. I've got to make all these statements today. No, I said probably. All right, I said

917
03:08:07,819 --> 03:08:13,500
probably. I gotta fix that. I will never play Lisa the Painful on this stream.

918
03:08:14,219 --> 03:08:27,379
There you go. I have to- Sometimes you gotta just pull the bandaid off. Go to the desert or riot.

919
03:08:29,239 --> 03:08:49,430
I'd like to see you try. I don't see anything new. I see Chadbird. I see everything that I've seen

920
03:08:49,430 --> 03:09:12,059
already. Where's the new pinata? The box. The box. What box? They were telling you to play desert

921
03:09:12,059 --> 03:09:18,500
bus, not go to the desert. I already did play desert bus and I gave up after about 15 minutes.

922
03:09:19,059 --> 03:09:22,819
I did desert bus vr and I was like, oh, this is kind of- I'm done.

923
03:09:24,500 --> 03:09:52,920
Wait, let's really reload the area. Why won't you play Lisa the Painful? Because I don't want to.

924
03:09:52,920 --> 03:09:59,180
I don't want to play that on stream. I don't- I'm not gonna. That's all the reason I need.

925
03:10:00,540 --> 03:10:04,620
I have to give you like a written essay as to why I'm not going to play Lisa the Painful on

926
03:10:04,620 --> 03:10:36,139
this stream. Is that my homework for next time? Wait, nope. Go to the Arctic. Lisa's like Dark

927
03:10:36,139 --> 03:10:43,319
Souls though. No, it's not. It's not. It's like an RPG. Like a top down. It is not. Yeah,

928
03:10:43,319 --> 03:10:56,219
nice try though. That could- you would have got me to play. Oh, penguins! It isn't top down.

929
03:10:56,780 --> 03:11:05,670
My whole world is upside down. Pengum. I kind of wish I'd, you know, made a-

930
03:11:08,549 --> 03:11:11,030
Really wish I made a kind of an ice place.

931
03:11:11,510 --> 03:11:23,540
What are you doing here? What should I bring? Will a penguin be able to exist in my land?

932
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:27,530
Maybe I should get him. All right, let's get him.

933
03:11:36,659 --> 03:11:54,149
All right, what is he like? Something hot. Something hot. All right, I can do- how about a-

934
03:11:54,149 --> 03:12:12,600
is it holly berry? What's hot? Is a holly berry hot? Is this hot? No! Hey! Get out.

935
03:12:13,450 --> 03:12:39,129
You idiot. And now they're running away. Just- where's- where you gonna crab? Juicy duck having

936
03:12:39,129 --> 03:12:56,649
a fun time? Seed guy? Come here. Gold. Gold's more valuable. Gold is. I'm just saying something

937
03:12:56,649 --> 03:13:19,700
that's stupid. Is this a yam? Fear tree? Punish him with a shovel? No. You guys are twisted.

938
03:13:20,260 --> 03:13:28,600
You guys are twisted. You guys are so fucking twisted. I can plant some more of these trees.

939
03:13:28,600 --> 03:13:44,379
Uh, how about over here? I'll do some more of these trees. Why not? They look nice. Cat? Well,

940
03:13:44,379 --> 03:13:51,129
there's milk just sitting there. Look, I can't- what- what's that I was saying? You can- you

941
03:13:51,129 --> 03:14:06,950
can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. What do you want me to do? Stop being so

942
03:14:06,950 --> 03:14:14,489
cool and go over here. Get over here! Come visit me! Hurry! Look what I have for you!

943
03:14:16,649 --> 03:14:35,219
He just stomped all over it! Got it! Okay, and now we eat. What did you just eat? He just ate

944
03:14:35,219 --> 03:15:01,319
something. Mouse. You. You're on the menu. Come on! A new taffly resident. No, you just drank my

945
03:15:01,319 --> 03:15:20,780
milk and you're fucking off? That was $1,400, man. You smug bastard. All right, well, how do I- I

946
03:15:20,780 --> 03:15:48,899
want cats to do this shit in real life. Yes, they do. Okay, is there another fad seed here?

947
03:15:51,799 --> 03:15:57,479
Okay, we're good. Fill this fucking hole. How do I- what's the requirement to get a frog to show up?

948
03:15:57,479 --> 03:16:15,059
And why have I not seen any crabs in two fucking hours of game time? Oh, 3.17 hours of game time.

949
03:16:15,059 --> 03:16:29,000
Shit, you're right. I want to plant these. Jerma, it's time for bed. Uh, you know, you're actually

950
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:39,209
right. It is. Thanks for reminding me. I gotta get off this computer soon. Very soon here. You're

951
03:16:39,209 --> 03:16:44,500
right. No, you're right, guys. You're right. How do I plant this? What the hell even is this thing?

952
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:53,799
Where do- I can't plant this anywhere. What is this? Hazelnut. Oh, it's- I can't plant it. It's

953
03:16:53,799 --> 03:17:04,090
just the nut. It's just the hazelnut. All right, where's that goddamn cat? And no crabs either.

954
03:17:09,420 --> 03:17:17,620
Unbelievable. Where are the crabs? The same crab showed up five times. And now that there's a surf

955
03:17:17,620 --> 03:17:24,420
board here, he doesn't want to show up ever again. And we got him. We got him. There he is. Get over

956
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:43,610
here, ladies and gentlemen. We got him. I didn't even mean to do that. Is he eating the apple?

957
03:17:44,489 --> 03:17:54,809
Okay, everyone inside. Come on over here. That's a gamer meme. I don't want to. Everything is here

958
03:17:54,809 --> 03:18:02,069
that you want. Everything is here that you like. Come spend eternity here. You just have to cross

959
03:18:02,069 --> 03:18:08,020
that line. Just cross that white line. And you will- you and I will be friends forever.

960
03:18:09,459 --> 03:18:18,760
You can do it. Just cross that line. Paradise. Water. Sand. There's a cool surfboard. Just walk

961
03:18:18,760 --> 03:18:27,159
over that line. That's all you need to do. Just cross the line. And there you go. Your signature

962
03:18:27,159 --> 03:18:43,829
is right here now. Excellent signature. Yes. Yes, it's very nice. Welcome. Welcome. Now stay.

963
03:18:44,969 --> 03:18:53,110
No, no, no. You can- you don't- Why is he leaving?

964
03:19:02,059 --> 03:19:22,120
He doesn't like the juicy duck. Okay. Well, at least you'll come over here. Eat a taffy.

965
03:19:22,120 --> 03:19:41,850
Taffy. Eat it. Second frog. Yeah. Second frog. Incoming. A crow. I kind of want one of these,

966
03:19:41,850 --> 03:19:50,250
as a friend. You need a dock patch on speed dial? All right. Eat this and then we can have a

967
03:19:50,250 --> 03:20:07,659
frog dance. I- Where's that cat? Seriously. Oh, look. Instant money. The piñata is ill.

968
03:20:08,379 --> 03:20:24,420
What is this guy? Sweet tooth. Oh, they're so cool. It's like a beaver. I gotta get this dude.

969
03:20:27,979 --> 03:20:37,260
Wait, what's wrong? Who's somebody sick over here? Oh, no. Taffy ate some bad candy. No.

970
03:20:42,860 --> 03:21:01,829
He ate rotten candy. What do I do? He's dying. What the hell on earth? How do I help him? Call

971
03:21:01,829 --> 03:21:21,190
the doctor quick. Please help him. All right. Get in here. The two frogs. Okay. Romance time.

972
03:21:21,190 --> 03:21:25,819
What do I need for them to romance? Green flutterscotch. Good fucking luck trying to

973
03:21:25,819 --> 03:21:34,149
figure that out. Will you get in here? This cat doesn't give a shit. All right. What do you want?

974
03:21:34,149 --> 03:21:42,819
Three fur cones. Okay. I got those. Right? I have a fur tree. What do I plant? Where's the fur tree?

975
03:21:44,469 --> 03:22:02,819
Where the fuck is the tree? I just planted one. Did I just plant one of these? He's good. He's good.

976
03:22:02,819 --> 03:22:14,219
Where did I plant that fur tree? This is the right there. Holy fuck. This thing's dying.

977
03:22:14,219 --> 03:22:29,579
He ran him over with his car. See, he's back to normal. Flying around. Having a good time.

978
03:22:30,139 --> 03:22:47,940
I need cones. Can I knock some cones down yet? All right. Just plant this shit. Fuck digging. Who

979
03:22:47,940 --> 03:23:14,139
cares? And we're gonna eat these. He's lazy. Yes, I am. Just go in the water. Go in the water. Go

980
03:23:14,139 --> 03:23:18,940
in the water. Go in the water. In the water. Get in the water. Stop flying away and get in the...

981
03:23:18,940 --> 03:23:23,540
I can't even put you out. I can't put you out. Get to fly in the water, man. Into the water.

982
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:29,379
Fly in the water. Fly in the water. Into the water. Into the water. Get in the water. You're

983
03:23:29,379 --> 03:23:40,709
gonna die. Go in the water. Are you drinking? Get... Okay. You're good. Oh, I want to do some more

984
03:23:40,709 --> 03:23:51,239
dressing. I want to do some more dressing up. This is moldy bread in the water. Fuck. All right.

985
03:23:51,239 --> 03:23:56,120
We're gonna make you look absolutely fucking wonderful. What plant dried out?

986
03:23:58,940 --> 03:24:24,299
Oh, will you fuck off? Is there... What plant dried out? Marshmallow three is very unhappy. Well,

987
03:24:24,299 --> 03:24:30,819
Marshmallow three is going to be food very, very soon. So, um, I'm sorry, but that's just the way

988
03:24:30,819 --> 03:24:57,459
it is. I need that cat to come back. And wouldn't there crab somewhere? Get out of here. No, fuck

989
03:24:57,540 --> 03:25:06,010
off. Get out of here. I need a kitty, you promised. I'm... I've actively been trying. You've seen it.

990
03:25:07,290 --> 03:25:13,209
Dear me, it's been three hours. That's all right. How much... What do I owe? I owe like $400 something?

991
03:25:13,209 --> 03:25:24,899
Whatever. I'm gonna get this cat. I need that cat to come eat a mouse. And then they'll be the

992
03:25:24,899 --> 03:25:34,379
resident. And then I'm gonna put a funny hat on them. And then I'll see you tomorrow. But I do

993
03:25:34,379 --> 03:25:47,500
want to do this right now on you. If I nod off, I suppose you'd better select a piñata to give this

994
03:25:47,500 --> 03:26:07,340
to. Here we go. Kind of like the ultimate creation. Should it be... Should we do it like a British

995
03:26:07,340 --> 03:26:29,899
bobby hat fruit hat? I mean, that's absolutely... That's wonderful. Bottles, glasses, caterpillars?

996
03:26:30,620 --> 03:27:04,780
Okay. Ears. Mermaid earrings. Jiggy earrings. Puzzle piece earrings? Well, no, no clown nose.

997
03:27:04,780 --> 03:27:24,299
Big jolly lips. The teeth? The teeth? No. No, that doesn't... The lips? Okay. Neck. A stethoscope!

998
03:27:24,299 --> 03:27:48,180
Oh, it's perfect! I'm out of money. A yeehaw saddle. Oh my god. I don't have any money.

999
03:27:48,180 --> 03:27:56,950
I need shoes, though. Kazooie talons. Like Banjo Kazooie. It's the same company. Fuck!

1000
03:27:57,510 --> 03:28:13,159
Good choice. If you see my parents, tell them I do actually need...

1001
03:28:13,799 --> 03:28:24,950
You... I don't know. What do you... Why... I'm... Let's take a look. All right. Cool. I like you. You have fun.

1002
03:28:24,950 --> 03:28:39,190
Look at that hat. Okay. Cat. No cats. This is rotten. What are you even doing here? Get out of here.

1003
03:28:39,909 --> 03:28:52,020
All right. Where's that taffy? There's a moth coming in. Where's that taffy?

1004
03:28:52,020 --> 03:29:14,170
Get this fucking bat. What am I hitting? Hit the bat! This is so fucked up. Where's the kitty?

1005
03:29:15,129 --> 03:29:42,969
I don't know. I... I tried. Where is it? Is there one? Oh, come on. Are you dead? All right.

1006
03:29:42,969 --> 03:29:55,899
Where is that cat? I need the cat to eat a mouse. Big time. Where? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All

1007
03:29:55,899 --> 03:30:11,559
right. Get over here. Eat a mouse. Come on. Wake up. Wake up. He's gone again. Gone again.

1008
03:30:11,559 --> 03:30:37,399
Gone again. Cat might not come in since there's no milk anymore. I'm not going to sit here and

1009
03:30:37,399 --> 03:30:47,579
just drop thousands and thousands of dollars. No. You promised. Yeah, I know. I'm going to try. I'm

1010
03:30:47,579 --> 03:31:09,100
going to try again. Fly into this so I can get 2,000 more dollars. Got it. All right. 2,000.

1011
03:31:09,100 --> 03:31:20,729
Oh, you're ready to go for a party. No, I want the camera. Don't pour it on him. Come here.

1012
03:31:30,069 --> 03:31:31,350
I think the badger got in there.

1013
03:31:37,989 --> 03:31:53,190
Ah, just me and the crew. You know, no big deal. All right. What's... I think they... Let me go to

1014
03:31:53,190 --> 03:32:04,340
the menu again. Give me the cyclopedia. We're looking for the cat. What does it take for a

1015
03:32:04,340 --> 03:32:09,379
kitty floss to show up? We're just going to appear... I have two resident mouse mallows in the garden

1016
03:32:09,379 --> 03:32:16,120
and it's nighttime. I have one bottle of milk in the garden. Three resident mouse mallows in the

1017
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:25,670
garden. All right. I need three mouses and I need milk. I can do that. They just need to... I need

1018
03:32:25,670 --> 03:32:30,549
to breed a mouse or just buy one. What does it take to breed? I already think I already have a couple.

1019
03:32:32,069 --> 03:32:35,670
They need to eat a yam. We can do that right now or just do romance candy,

1020
03:32:35,670 --> 03:32:36,870
but I think yams are probably cheaper.

1021
03:32:52,969 --> 03:33:13,940
Romance. Ah, romance candy. Yeah. Bye. Go for it. Romance candy. Eat it. You. Romance candy.

1022
03:33:16,680 --> 03:33:24,760
Tell this shit because it's just stinking up the place. Quick. Don't let him eat it.

1023
03:33:30,860 --> 03:33:35,020
I just sprint around. Okay. Let's get a third one and then I'll get some milk.

1024
03:33:39,959 --> 03:33:46,229
How could you not like it? I thought this was Animal Crossing. Some people wish it was.

1025
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:59,159
Sorry. I was looking at the chat. I mean, this doesn't have to be... This doesn't have to be that

1026
03:33:59,159 --> 03:34:17,829
good of a... We just need one. Wait, there is three. There are three. Give me some milk.

1027
03:34:18,549 --> 03:34:37,500
Play something cool with blood tomorrow. That's so funny. Dude, play something with

1028
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:44,860
blood and like... Shoot people and like... Axe and hit people in the head with a fucking axe.

1029
03:34:44,860 --> 03:34:58,620
Play that one. Okay. Play blood. There's no blood in this one. I'm playing Ikaruga tomorrow.

1030
03:34:59,799 --> 03:35:06,260
All right. I've got milk. I've got three mice. It's going to be night time. We're getting that

1031
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:23,260
fucking cat. The new resident. Where? The cat has to eat a sparrow. Well, we'll go get one.

1032
03:35:23,260 --> 03:35:25,180
I'll get one. I'll express deliver it.

you know what i like more than materialistic things german knowledge

1212
04:04:44,649 --> 04:04:48,250
okay in fact i'm a lot more proud of these seven new shelves

1213
04:04:48,250 --> 04:04:51,930
that i had to get installed to hold 2 000 new bottles of cvd oil

1214
04:04:51,930 --> 04:04:55,290
that i bought from my boomer back like the trillionaire barry

1215
04:04:55,290 --> 04:04:59,450

1218
04:05:22,790 --> 04:05:25,829
germa tell us about the cat you mentioned having also thanks for playing

1219
04:05:25,829 --> 04:05:29,670
viva it's nice to have a chill stream in the background while writing

1220
04:05:29,670 --> 04:05:33,110
uh you're referring to young soy which is kim's

1221
04:05:33,110 --> 04:05:39,540
cat or it was kim's cat until it was given to one of her friends because we

1222
04:05:39,540 --> 04:05:43,860
moved and uh didn't really have the opportunity

1223
04:05:43,860 --> 04:05:59,399
to bring the cat to las vegas and originally

1224
04:05:59,399 --> 04:06:08,760
that was kim's kim sort of got young soy it was sort of

1225
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:12,280
i think from my understanding it was she was taking care of

1226
04:06:12,280 --> 04:06:19,110
that cat temporarily because that was not really hers to begin with i guess it

1227
04:06:19,110 --> 04:06:22,790
was like a stray and she was just doing her best to take

1228
04:06:22,790 --> 04:06:26,790
care of the cat until i figured out what we were going to do

1229
04:06:26,790 --> 04:06:43,180
would you ever want a cat i've had lots of cats before

1230
04:06:43,180 --> 04:06:47,260
my family had at least six five or six of them

1231
04:06:47,260 --> 04:06:51,459
one of my old cats was actually in a video

1232
04:06:51,459 --> 04:06:59,700
and uh i mean that cat has since left this earth but i've had cats a lot

1233
04:06:59,700 --> 04:07:03,139
at least five or six of them over the couple decades where i was in my

1234
04:07:03,139 --> 04:07:17,559
parents house you know update the wiki the purpose we were trying to we were

i played floygan brothers for like 40 minutes

1307
04:14:06,739 --> 04:14:11,780

in the shower thank you on a separate note how do you

1322
04:15:14,090 --> 04:15:17,209
feel about a stream where you hire an actual therapist and

1323
04:15:17,209 --> 04:15:22,200
get group therapy for you and chat i don't think i would want that i don't i

1324
04:15:22,200 --> 04:15:25,079
don't i don't think i want to go to a therapist on stream

1325
04:15:25,079 --> 04:15:28,440
because i don't want to sit there and have them analyze me

1326
04:15:28,440 --> 04:15:31,879
and then it would be like what if they come up with some fucked up shit

1327
04:15:31,879 --> 04:15:35,379
you know what i mean like i don't want to do that i feel i feel like that was

1328
04:15:35,379 --> 04:15:42,040
like that would be out of my comfort zone i think

1329
04:15:42,040 --> 04:15:45,159
like what i don't what if they're like let's talk about your childhood or

1347
04:21:52,139 --> 04:21:56,229
mind wasn't happy uh now because of all the virus that's

04:29:15,799 --> 04:29:23,770
to play you know what it was what was it it was not

1419
04:29:23,770 --> 04:29:36,309
odama it was mario sunshine that's correct uh at least one of

1420
04:29:36,309 --> 04:29:41,370
those mario sunshine streams was a full-blown crack stream

1421
04:29:41,370 --> 04:29:48,379
and that was like two weeks ago so that was more meth based

1422
04:29:48,379 --> 04:29:51,979
anybody hear that yes because i opened my own stream because i wanted to see

1425
04:30:10,069 --> 04:30:14,250
the second mario sunshine stream yes so it doesn't have to be a game it doesn't

1426
04:30:14,250 --> 04:30:16,899
