1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:17,379
Hello. How are you? How are you doing? How are things? You good? What's up? I changed my Twitch

2
00:00:17,379 --> 00:00:29,559
server. Let's see if that fixes the problem. Streaming on a different server. If you're not

3
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:37,159
here last night, every like five minutes I would drop like a few hundred frames for no reason. It

4
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:45,740
seemed to happen at the same exact interval. Apparently I have negative latency to your stream.

5
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:55,219
I'm seeing it before you stream it. That's weird. Uh, some people were saying that it might have

6
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,500
been a Twitch problem. Maybe the server I was connecting to. So I changed servers. Let's see

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,620
if it fixes it. If not, then I, unfortunately, don't know what to do about it because my internet

8
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:18,700
seems to be perfect. Today, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be very calm today. I'm going to relax. I'm going

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:27,019
to, I'm going to be in Zen mode. I'm not going to get angry today. I'm going to very desperately

10
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:39,560
try to stay focused and my voice will not go over a certain amount of DB level. Okay. It's going to

11
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,909
be collected. I'm going to just relax and enjoy the world of Elden Ring because that's all I do

12
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:55,290
now. I'm literally an Elden Ring streamer. I don't do anything else. Uh, but yeah, I'm looking

13
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:08,229
forward to it. It'd be a good time as always. Hey, Jerma the Bod for the what? The Bod for

14
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:17,139
that last boss fight got deleted. Did it? No, it didn't. Don't forget about Smite Saturdays.

15
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:30,870
Did you smoke before this? No. I would never play Elden Ring inebriated. Yeah, that's not going to

16
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:38,699
happen. You understand how impossible that would be? You're asking me to do an impossible task.

17
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,580
You can't, like that's like handing somebody that's like just, just zonked out of their mind

18
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:58,300
of Rubik's Cube. Then you have one minute to solve this. Huh? How's this it? It's scabbed over. It

19
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:14,949
looks pretty bad. Whatever. I'm literally doing that right now. It's not that bad. I would be

20
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:21,990
completely de-stressed, but that would be an unwatchable stream because I would walk into

21
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:29,590
boss encounters and die in five seconds and I wouldn't even care. I'd be like, Oh man,

22
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,990
that's what he does. Oh, okay. And that would happen for two or three straight hours. Like

23
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:39,430
I wouldn't even attack the boss. So many people like claim that they would stay here and watch

24
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,009
that kind of shit. But after an hour or two of doing that, I wouldn't attack the boss.

25
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,400
You just, you would go do something else. You'd find something else to do. You just would.

26
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:02,819
That would be the best stream. It would not. It would be an actual improvement. Oh, get out of

27
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:14,389
here. Okay. Uh, you guys ready? It's a couple of things. I, I have marked some things on the map

28
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:25,029
that I want to do. A few of them in particular. I want to continue this quest line for Ranny.

29
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:40,629
Maybe please just do one designated song stream with me strong. All right. I will, I'm, it might

30
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:53,620
be fun to do a, a me strong stream in Elden ring and I would just be role playing. You guys are

31
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,259
not going to want to watch it. It's going to be awful. No one's going to do it. No one's going

32
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:04,300
to want to watch that stream. I'm telling you, there's going to be threads on Reddit about this

33
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,420
about like, I mean, like that was like, not that funny. It was like kind of fucking like

34
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,540
irresponsible and annoying of him. Um, like that was the worst stream 2022 without a doubt. Like

35
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,860
it was, that was just boring and like, not funny. You guys are not going to like this stream. I'm

36
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,180
just, I want to be, I want to be clipped completely sober of sound mind and sound body. They will be

37
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,300
people that they're going to be a lot of people that are going to think that's the worst frame

38
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,829
of the year. Okay. I just want to make sure I'm clear on that. So let's just, I'm going to,

39
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:40,870
I'm going to make it so you can't nominate it. It's grayed out. Okay. You guys ready? I'm ready.

40
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:53,509
Let's get into it. Can you guys hear it? You can't. No, you can't. Make sure I've got my fan

41
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:00,089
going already. And even been five minutes. I'm getting that fan going layer blowing on me.

42
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:30,490
That cannot be the way that is though. So use me. I've got like red circles under my eyes. Why?

43
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,879
What does that mean? Actually, nothing sits in lighting the way the lighting is in the room.

44
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:47,180
Yeah, it's just weird lighting. All right. I gotta move this out of the way. So last thing we did,

45
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,439
by the way, this is the most face cams per capita you've ever had.

46
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:05,259
This is the most face cams you've ever had like in a row. So what? It's something I don't normally

47
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:12,939
do. Okay. I want to show you some stuff. First of all, let me show you some things. I have marked

48
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:20,170
on the map specifically where we are going to go. We're going to go here. I was told by somebody

49
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:26,060
in chat that this is a place that I would be very interested in. So I marked it. I also wanted to

50
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:34,040
make sure that I checked, got this map fragment. I also wanted to check out this place because it

51
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:42,170
looked kind of cool, like a church or something, right? I also wanted to go here. This looked like

52
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,170
an interesting boulder of some sort. And I don't know what this spiky stuff is, but this looks like

53
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:55,990
an interesting boulder to me. Zip will go away in like a week. Don't worry. And then I want to

54
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:04,600
continue the quest line. So at the end of that Redan fight, the stars all fell. And I was like,

55
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,279
oh, falling stars, falling stars. And I had to go find them. So I'm going to go look over here

56
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,279
because from the lore perspective, it sounded like it may have been somewhere

57
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,180
around this vicinity, if I were to take a guess. So we're going to check this out here.

58
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:31,060
Permanent Zip. South of the Mistwood. That's what I was thinking too. I was thinking like somewhere

59
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:38,419
in this vicinity here. Because this looks like an area it could fall. Nice cringe lore. That's like

60
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:47,929
one of the coolest parts of all the Dark Souls games is like the lore. Has anybody ever looked

61
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:54,470
at you like that before in your life? I used to get that all the time. I used to get that all of

62
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,480
the time. Like it'd be like, something, I'm saying something, saying something. That's equal parts

63
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:12,090
stop and equal parts. What are you doing? What are you saying? Like, yeah, me too.

64
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:24,570
That happened to me too. Yeah. Microwave rant. I need to start to put a tally on how many times

65
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:34,019
that happens to me. It's very distinctive. It's not a book. It's not. Nope. It's not. It's,

66
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:45,509
it's very distinct. It's, it's equally parts confused and upset and kind of like what?

67
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:54,580
All right. Let's go. We're going to check section one, which is this part right here. I'm going to

68
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:01,509
go in order. I heard this is something I'd be interested in. That's the face that I make almost

69
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:11,259
all the time when watching you. You're wicked funny. Okay. So the, how do I get up there though?

70
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:25,429
I was told I'd be very interested in this space here. Okay. I don't think I can get up here this

71
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:33,580
way. All right. There's like some, there's some cringe rocks in the way. How am I going to, from

72
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:41,220
this way? How do I get on this road? This is all, this is the bridge. Okay. So how,

73
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:47,059
I'm going to have to go from here, aren't I? I don't think I can get up there from here.

74
00:10:52,570 --> 00:11:01,350
Yeah. I'll go from here or I think I have to go backwards from here. I don't know. Or maybe

75
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:11,179
forwards from here. Let's try forwards from here. Doesn't know how to read a map. You look like

76
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,379
some, I don't, I know. I know. I look like everybody you've ever seen in your life.

77
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:40,659
So I need to go this way. Not that way over here. Look like my grandma. That would actually be kind

78
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:56,250
of funny if I really did look like your grandmother. This is just an item here. Fire arrows. Cool.

79
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,490
Okay. Let's keep going. I got to follow the, just the path. Yeah. I didn't get a bunch of these

80
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:09,580
things. Hey, can you please kiss the camera? You know how many times I've done that? There's

81
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:15,960
somebody in here. You know how many times I've kissed the camera and regretted it immediately

82
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,610
after doing it. Who's this guy? War Master Shaq.

83
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:43,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

84
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Yeah. Battle arts.

85
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:16,019
Okay. This guy sells battle arts? Ah, okay. Very cool. Well, I don't think I really need any of

86
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:24,970
these or want any of these in this playthrough because I'm a magic magician person. So pretty

87
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:59,460
cool though. What level am I? 60. Oh, knowledge of the arts.

88
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,059
All right. See you later. Have fun. Good luck with you. It's the world's wacky out there.

89
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,669
Just be careful. That's cool though. I don't need any of that, but that's cool to know that

90
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:25,000
that's what that is. We're going to continue. I want to go that way. I had a dream last night

91
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:35,269
that you did an in-person event. You were there. You did an in-person event. You did an IRL like

92
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:40,309
tier list, like live show. What? It's like kind of fun. What are you talking about?

93
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,350
Ooh, this is a new space. All right. What's, what's here? There's probably something here

94
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:10,179
that I didn't get. Jort sword. Oh, come on. I don't want to fight anybody. I just want to

95
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:26,360
like take all the stuff in your camp. I don't want to fight you for it. I don't want to fight

96
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:36,600
you for any of this stuff. I just want it. I met you while lucid dreaming. We need the guy with

97
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,830
the green hat on. What the fuck, dude? What? We both were flying next to each other and I looked

98
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,190
over and you gave me the thumbs up and like, and I had the big airplane goggles on, like the big,

99
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:59,909
like the red Baron goggles on. That was so much fun. It sucks though, when I fucking,

100
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,470
like I stopped flapping my wings and I like froze in midplace and did a big cartoon gulp and fell.

101
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,470
You laughed at that, which is kind of fucking, that's kind of annoying,

102
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:24,519
but you know, it was still cool to see you though. I had a dream that you were over mine.

103
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,159
You're losing so many viewers. Um, I don't, I don't hear a thing. I don't think I'm,

104
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,519
I don't think we're losing viewers. I think we're getting to the stage where a lot of people don't

105
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:50,120
want to see because a lot of people aren't necessarily grinding out this game. So the

106
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,600
further we go in Elden Ring, the further that people might not be and they might not want to see.

107
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,440
So that's the phenomenon you're experiencing here and that's cope.

108
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:12,839
That's streamer cope, but it's true. It's true. See, one person says that. You know how I know

109
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,000
that. Do you know why I know that's true? Because the first three or four days of Elden Ring,

110
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was watching tons of streamers. Oh my God, how'd they do with that guy? I have avoided every

111
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,940
single person's broadcast the last like four days. I've not looked at anybody, no one. So I mean that

112
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:38,660
ego kind of, kind of the way it is. All right, so I got to cross this bridge, but not yet.

113
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:46,660
And plus, I don't, not every stream has to have

114
00:17:47,380 --> 00:18:08,980
20,000 people on it. I get it, man. I get it. These guys have so much health. He's gonna break

115
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:18,089
down because he's lost it. But I mean, I've only been live for fucking like 15 minutes. I don't,

116
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:30,180
I don't pay attention to that kind of stuff that much. Should I kill this thing? It has so much

117
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:39,750
health. Wait, how come this one doesn't have that much health? These vary in how much health they have.

118
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:48,819
Okay, so wait a minute. That one that was on the rooftop, I couldn't even hurt.

119
00:18:48,819 --> 00:19:03,819
Is it just because they scaled to the area they're in? Yes. Frames dropping again? No,

120
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:17,750
they're not. Don't even say that. What? It can't be. Be serious. No. Hold on a minute. Let me,

121
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:46,180
let me do it. Let me do something real quick. Give me one second. I don't get it. My speed

122
00:19:46,180 --> 00:20:04,630
tests are perfect. It couldn't get any better than this. It couldn't. What's going on? Yeah,

123
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:13,000
I was running a speed test. That's why I killed it. I don't think server matters. This is happening

124
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:31,539
to east coast streamers too. What? I did switch servers. I did. Yeah, I just ran a speed test and

125
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:46,660
it's perfect. Well, that's frustrating. Sorry guys. I wish there was something I could do about it.

126
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:57,269
I don't think it's a problem on my end. I don't. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that we kind of have to

127
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:06,759
painfully deal with this because I changed servers. It doesn't seem to have fixed anything.

128
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:33,509
Well, we will press on. I got to go down there. Cross this bridge. It's not fine. It's not bad.

129
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,579
Yeah, that really does. It still sucks though because this is one of those games and one of

130
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:46,059
those streams where we're like kind of experiencing this and the harder it is to experience for some

131
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:54,250
of you guys, the more irritated it makes me. This is so new. It looks fine. It's probably going to

132
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:05,980
keep happening. Unfortunately, I don't think there's very much I could do about it. Let's just

133
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:18,980
kill this guy. Cause I'm probably my leveled up for this area. Probably it's all your fault.

134
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:35,430
I think stone. Yeah, we're in. Okay. So now I'm here. I was told that I would, I'd be very

135
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,279
interested in this area over here. And there's also something in the middle here too. All right. I

136
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:54,970
haven't seen any of this, so let's, let's take a, let's take a minute. Hey, I have a question. Is

137
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:04,500
the, is the tree in the middle? Is that why? Hold on. Is the tree just in the middle of every zone?

138
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:26,339
It is, right? I'll, I'll, I'll show you this gigantic tree. Am I still in combat?

139
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:40,390
Oh, like is, is, is this the tree here? Just huge in the middle. That would make sense.

140
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:55,400
All right, let's do it. This is the area I was told to come explore.

141
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:07,269
I said, Jerma, go check out this area. Somebody said you'd be very interested to see what's here.

142
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:25,720
Not actually this space, but you know, a little bit further. What a boat. Why don't you just get

143
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:36,069
out and walk? What's the point of being in a boat? You're that, that's harder to push. Who Tibia,

144
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:52,460
who Mar- who is this? Tibia Mariner? Where are you? Is this, is this the Mar- is this them right here?

145
00:24:53,259 --> 00:25:04,599
Where are you? Where'd you go? Are you hiding? Oh, there you are.

146
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:18,920
You can't be that dangerous, right? Like I'm- is this person just actually in a boat?

147
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:28,410
This person like sucks. I, I think they got to like the boss sign up sheet.

148
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:35,509
And from software is just like, oh, all right, I guess we're going to add you. That's fine.

149
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:52,069
Where'd you go? All right, let's go kill this guy. Yeah. Okay. Uh, so you, you want to be a boss

150
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:59,190
in Elden Ring? Yes. What do you do, man? Ah, I have a boat. All right. Boat encounter. Sick. Cool.

151
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,109
Boat encounter, man. All right. So you're going to be like flying down like a speedboat. You're

152
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:13,769
going to have like a Kraken come up. Um, yeah. No way, bro. Seriously. Oh, wow. Yeah, absolutely.

153
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:21,609
So how much damage do you think you could do? Two. Two thousand? No fucking way, bro. Cool.

154
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:35,829
Get them on there quick. Get them on the list. This poor guy. This is just a regular enemy. He

155
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:44,259
wasn't supposed to be in the game. I feel so bad. I actually feel bad for that guy.

156
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:58,490
Death root. Skeletal militiaman ashes. Okay. Hey, don't even say anything else, man.

157
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:12,619
Welcome to Dark Souls. Welcome to Elden Ring, man. That actually is Pinwheel. That was, that was,

158
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:16,859
that was easier than Pinwheel. Even if I was, because I'm probably, what level am I? Level 60?

159
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:26,700
Yeah, I'm level 60. So if I was like level 45 or 50, I still think that would be impossible to lose.

160
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,009
That's not possible to lose. That guy literally was like the last minute sign-up.

161
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:58,490
Okay. Well, that was fun. Anything else here? That was cool. This guy in a fucking boat. Oh,

162
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:16,619
just die. I was level 16 when I did that. I got bone boys. I think is it only two or is it more

163
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:30,009
than two bone boys? Okay. I think there's a place to go down here. I think there's a dungeon here.

164
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:56,950
I would be surprised if there wasn't. By the way, I have to get intelligence to 52 if I plan on

165
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:04,920
using that staff. There's got to be a way to go down. All right. There's got to be.

166
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:32,059
Check over here one more time. This, that down here. I don't know. I don't see anything. Oh,

167
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:42,740
my back. Okay. I don't see any way to go down. Maybe it's here somewhere. I'll check one more

168
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:50,890
time this way. And that's it. All right. Somebody said next to the turtle. Are you sure? Are you,

169
00:29:50,890 --> 00:30:05,509
are you, are you sure? Are you for real? I said what turtle? Turtle? Are you for real? Next to

170
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:14,250
the turtle. I don't remember where the turtle was. Where's the turtle? Is it a turtle? Ah,

171
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:18,299
fuck it. Whatever. I'll come back later. I don't know. I don't know what the turtle is.

172
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:41,259
I don't know what the turtle is. What about over there? Not over here. What about this one?

173
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:11,579
Thanks. I can't go down here. Why not? How do I get down there? It's a stone sword. Oh, it is.

174
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,339
Let's go. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. I got plenty of these.

175
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:30,470
Let's go. Let's go for it. I don't just, this dungeon is gonna get me kicked off the internet.

176
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:50,019
I don't have to fight these, right? Okay. Cause I like the turtle thing. Like everybody loves

177
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:53,460
the turtles in Elden Ring and like, I'm not just going to kill a room full of turtles.

178
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:10,309
Green turtle talisman. I got the turtle talisman. What's that? Oh, that's good. Raises stamina

179
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:20,329
recovery speed. Turtles are known as a nutritious ingredient symbolic of inexhaustible power.

180
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:37,460
So I just have permanent stamina recovery. So what's, is that better than slowly? How much HP does

181
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:52,660
this load? It's low HP and maybe get rid of this. That's the best talisman in the game. Well, that's

182
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:06,170
was worth, that was worth coming down here. Very cool. It's really slow, but it'll save you flasks.

183
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:19,609
Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Turtle friend. What a weird animal. What a weird animal. It's

184
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:29,369
like, it's like this weird, like almost like an elephant, but they have elephant feet and like

185
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:36,089
lizard heads and like big, like rock bodies. What a fucking weird animal. Like what an interest.

186
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:47,109
And they live to be like 150 years old. So strange. They have elephant feet. Yeah. Look at

187
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:58,460
there. Look at, look at this guy's elephant feet. He's got elephant feet. Cool. They're so slow,

188
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:13,000
but they're so wise. Did we just make that up by the way? Is this reason why like the turtle in

189
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,239
all TV shows and movies is old and has like a brow? Is it because they're old and we just like made

190
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:35,880
them, we just pretend they are? Oh, okay. Old equals wise. That's right. They live a long time.

191
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,980
Yeah. That's why we've made them like intelligent beings. We made them like super intelligent alien

192
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,730
beings. They live a long time, but that's cool though. That's cool to you that they can live

193
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:53,590
that long. All right. So now I want to go this way. That was not what I was told to go see.

194
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:01,400
I gotta keep going. Elephants are wise. Elephants are very intelligent, right? Elephants are very

195
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:12,489
wise, but I can't remember a piece of media, TV show, cartoon, movie, video game where an elephant

196
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:18,969
was, yes, it's me, the elephant, the old and wise elephant with like gray hairs here. How many,

197
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:33,289
how many gray haired tortoises have you seen? I think I gotta go this way. It's turtles and

198
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:40,199
owls. No, the ninja turtles don't count. They got covered in ooze. That doesn't count.

199
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,789
They could, any animal could have been in that ooze and they would have become,

200
00:35:51,429 --> 00:36:01,079
you know, that. It could have been like the ninja seahorses if they, if they'd gone in that goo. So

201
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:13,179
that doesn't count. Okay. Where is it? This is, there's apparently a cave here somewhere. I was

202
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:24,090
told explicitly to come here. How come they chose turtles for that show? They just kind of did,

203
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:37,480
didn't they? That's up further, but up there, those turtles are cool. Turtles are cool.

204
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:51,940
They should have just used people, but that would just be teenage mutant ninjas, teenage mutant

205
00:36:51,940 --> 00:37:12,809
ninjas, heroes, teenagers. How would you even do that? Okay. I think this is right. What do I

206
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:25,860
have against turtles? I just told you that I thought turtles were cool animal. Can you swing

207
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:33,079
at them please? Oh my goodness. Really? Are you that bad? I just said that I thought turtles were

208
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:56,739
cool. All right. So what's here? What is it? There's something right here. What is it? Ah,

209
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,380
do you not think snakes are cool? I think snakes are cool that they just scare me.

210
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:13,019
Oh, all right. Okay. Cool. Let's go. Snakes kind of scare the shit out of me. Not because,

211
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,820
and I honestly, I don't, I'm not afraid of snakes. I'm afraid of snakes unpredictability.

212
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:31,739
Snakes are unpredictable. I have this fear of, okay, snake is just like, oh, you want to hold

213
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:37,260
the snake? Yeah, sure. And they're just kind of, it's wrapping around my arm and looking at me and

214
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:44,940
going, it's like, oh, hey, hey, hey, little guy, like licking and like, kind of looks cute. And

215
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:54,260
then I move like a way that they don't like any, and I'm like, and I start to fucking pass out and

216
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,559
shit. Like, I don't know if they freak me out. I just feel like they're unpredictable. Like you

217
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:05,449
can't determine like what the move is that they're not going to like. So like, if you have a snake

218
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:11,510
in front of you and you turn your eyes a certain way, I don't like that. I don't like what you just

219
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:21,340
did. And like they hear it fucking strike. I don't know. They don't, they're unpredictable.

220
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:29,349
What about children are unpredictable too? Yes, a child is unpredictable. But the difference is

221
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:36,230
watching like a two year old like bounce around walking and like bump into a wall is not the same

222
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,829
as a snake biting you in the neck. It's different. A toddler is not going to come up to you and look

223
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:50,380
at you and be like, what is it a little Johnny? What do you want? And just like fucking leech,

224
00:39:50,380 --> 00:40:03,530
like leap at you and like fucking strike you right here. How am I supposed to get down there?

225
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:11,269
Horses are unpredictable too. I'm just saying, and I'm saying a lot, there's no poisonous horses.

226
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:19,480
Look, if a snake, if there was snakes that just bit you and that was it, it's like, fuck, I got a

227
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,039
snake bite. A shitload of snakes can literally kill you. They can, but there's not a poisonous

228
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:31,300
horse. Although if a horse like fucking kicks you in the face, it's going to cave in your face.

229
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,219
Okay, that argument's not that sound. But you understand what I mean though? Like a snake can

230
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:44,420
hide. A snake can hide somewhere in like a bush. I know that at the danger level of a horse,

231
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,849
if you get, you know, kicked, bucked in the face, it's going to blow up your whole face and you're

232
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:54,809
going to die instantly. But like I can see the horse, I can run from the horse, right? I can see

233
00:40:54,809 --> 00:41:00,969
the horse from a mile away. A snake just like in a bush is like, where is he? I don't know. He's

234
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:04,650
somewhere near me. And then they get off and they're like this and they go like that. And

235
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:10,150
they like fucking fray out their heads. And then it's like, okay, if I move, I'm dead.

236
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:23,739
It's unpredictable. Guys, like tigers are like that too. Sometimes like a tiger or a lion will

237
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:31,349
just be like, oh, like, it's just like, whoa, whoa, what happened? What happened? What's going on?

238
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,550
What's going on? Why'd they freak out? Like sometimes they just freak out. Sometimes animals

239
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:44,300
like just freak out. Snakes. Tigers are like, no, I don't like unpredictable animals. I like

240
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,699
predictable animals. Like a, like a fucking little like sausage dog because they're just going to

241
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:53,420
lie on the couch and they're not going to like, there's no point where Otto is going to like

242
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,460
roll over. I'm going to be rubbing his stomach and he's going to go like, oh yeah. And like,

243
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:16,900
come and fucking kill me. Like it's not going to happen. Oh, the title of the stream. Do you

244
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:23,300
live in a rainforest? No, I don't live in a rainforest. I'm just saying I'm comfortable.

245
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,500
I'm not comfortable around certain animals as much as I think they're cool. I think snakes are

246
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:33,139
really cool animals. I just don't want to hold one. And I know that, oh, but Mr. Snookums,

247
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:38,900
my snake is so cool. I, that's fine. I don't care. Hold them. I'll watch. I'll take a fucking picture

248
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,650
like big tarantula spiders. No, I don't want to hold you tarantula. I don't get it. That's

249
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:58,329
I want to be within like three or four counties away from that thing. Your neck is all red. I'm

250
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:05,690
telling you. That's what I'm saying. I get bit by a snake. Have you ever seen a wild tarantula?

251
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,460
Look, we're not talking about in the wild. We're talking about like people that have pets.

252
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,179
There's a ton of people that have tarantula pets. A ton of people have snakes for pets.

253
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:21,179
I'm glad you like it. I hope you enjoy it. I know they're probably so loving and so wonderful.

254
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,260
I don't want it near me. I don't want to be near it. I just want to look. I'll look at it

255
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:44,179
from like a distance. Okay. I need to level up. And those little ball pythons, they're so cute

256
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,179
and they're so nice and they're so fun and they'll just kind of sit and hang out with you.

257
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,340
That one moment, one moment in my brain where like I did something unpredictable to the snake

258
00:43:55,699 --> 00:44:06,619
and he latches on. Don't let go. You can put it on a leash. You don't put a leash on a snake.

259
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:32,099
What are you talking about? Oh, I can do it now. All right. Let me uh, okay. This that way. Okay.

260
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:44,489
Object permanence time. Object permanence time. Down, right, left. Got it. Okay. You go right.

261
00:44:44,489 --> 00:45:19,380
1100 damage. Holy crap. Okay. This leads into this waterfall area. Do that once.

262
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:53,909
Okay. This is a tiny little area to fight this. What? I don't have any juice left.

263
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:09,210
Bad timing. I gotta get around him. Here we go. It's not doing enough damage to remotely even

264
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:45,690
considered using. Oh man. He's susceptible to that for sure. Behind you. What? Still alive?

265
00:46:45,690 --> 00:47:07,369
You were very susceptible to that. Land octopus ovary. Cross naginata causes blood loss. Dex C.

266
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:24,360
This thing looks crazy. Oh, it's a spear. That's cool. It's a spider behind you.

267
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:47,500
Oh, got him. Damn it. My room is too clean. I was hoping I could put like a piece of like

268
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,179
brown or like black dust or something in my hand and be like, oh yeah, and show it.

269
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:56,409
Well, I thought that was going to be like a piece, like a little piece of something like I could put

270
00:47:56,409 --> 00:48:04,099
in my hand. Why do you look AI generated? I don't know because I'm ugly. Okay. Why don't you just

271
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:30,150
say what you want to say? Ooh. Okay. So that's, there's nothing here. You won't acknowledge his

272
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:35,190
dude. I was literally pretending to bite my neck with a snake.

273
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:43,960
Can you imagine if I just showed up on stream one day and they were just like,

274
00:48:49,269 --> 00:49:09,860
I just don't say anything. I need 20,000. I'm, I'm putting it into health. Don't worry.

275
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:23,500
Just be covered in boils for your next stream. No, I, that would be, that would be concerning.

276
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:30,230
Could be like, what the hell's happening? Is he okay? If I just have like boils everywhere,

277
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,269
like big bubbles, like I got, I went to a prosthetic makeup person or something and had

278
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:40,070
him all over me. You guys would be like, what's, what happened? I would actually scare the shit

279
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,150
out of people. And if I didn't make a joke about it or something, I feel like people would not be

280
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:54,199
happy about that. It'd be like, dude, come on. Like, what the fuck? Just draw a bunch more zits.

281
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:04,820
You just say you're allergic to something. Yeah. Sorry guys. I changed laundry detergents.

282
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:16,619
That's actually kind of funny. Yeah. Sorry guys. I, I, I'm using a new brand of detergent and

283
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:25,030
I think it's my blanket. I don't know. Had a big reaction to it because that is everything down

284
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:40,150
there. I have enough to level up. I think let's just do it. Where was that? I want that spear.

285
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:49,940
I'll show you in just a sec. Uh, that spear is behind the big optic octopus in the Gale tunnel,

286
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,500
which is in this weird section down over the off the road here between, uh,

287
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:01,429
Kalid and limb grave come down this way. There's a cave down here. There's some

288
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:12,469
enemies down here as well. You're looking for that, uh, pretty good weapon. It looks kind of cool.

289
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:23,880
I'll have to check it out. I'll try it on. I need one more kill should do it. And then I'm

290
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:41,989
going to put it into health. How big is your spear? Um, well, this is a, this is a short sword. So

291
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:47,670
it's like, maybe, well, I was using a dagger before, so three, four inches.

292
00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:55,769
You talk about like the blade, like from the blade to the, uh, handle. That's a lot. That's

293
00:51:55,769 --> 00:52:00,869
what I was using. It was a dagger. Oh, what? Oh my God. What the heck happened? I said something

294
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:20,010
weird and gross. All right, let's keep going. No reason to fight any of you.

295
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:33,880
I would get banned from my own chat. We'll just be clear. I would get banned from my own chat.

296
00:52:33,880 --> 00:53:05,219
Like I would actually get banned from my own chat. Hey, race mimic. What is that? Oh,

297
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:09,300
it's the thing where you break it and it kills. It gets rid of all your souls and puts you to a

298
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:24,949
bonfire. Five of them. That was down here. That's it. Oh, hold on. This is, this is

299
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:56,219
smithing stone. There's something big behind here. Okay. Is there a bonfire right here?

300
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:03,820
Cause that thing is, whatever that is, it's big. This guy died at pinwheel. Yes, of course. I'm

301
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:15,590
glad I didn't just open that door. Did you play destiny too? If there was sex scenes? No,

302
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:29,130
who cares? It's down here. This is the other entrance. Uh, I have way too many flasks

303
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:39,670
been acting up lately. Like this chest thing. Let's do, uh, I'll do seven and two.

304
00:54:40,389 --> 00:55:05,099
All right. Who's in here? Go headphones. Magma worm. Didn't I already fight this guy?

305
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:19,500
All right. Oh no. I thought the magma worm maker. So this guy is made by the big magma worm guy.

306
00:55:19,500 --> 00:56:02,920
Okay. Well I have experience fighting you, but glint stones. What am I doing? I'm not, I'm not,

307
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:38,650
I'm not like at Disney world. Like what am I doing? Oh, now does he stand up like his friend?

308
00:56:39,289 --> 00:56:57,909
Stop doing that move. Stop doing the move. This tiny little area. Stop doing that move. Stop

309
00:56:57,909 --> 00:57:04,630
doing that move. Okay. Like dude, you guys gonna run a circle? It's a tiny circle.

310
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:21,820
I got it. I got it. Not all these magma worms. They're magma worm maker. He makes the magma

311
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:31,699
worms. He's like, he's like the chocolate factory guy. He died to the magma worm at level 60.

312
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:41,079
Did your magma worm do three or four magma runs in a row? I didn't think so. So who?

313
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:58,489
Okay. Object permanence. Where are we going? Wrong way. Can I summon Oleg in there? But Oleg

314
00:57:58,489 --> 00:58:41,179
kind of sucks against these guys. I actually would rather have the boys. Oh, the boys are dead.

315
00:58:50,619 --> 00:59:27,800
Oh, he spins all the way around. Let that fire dissipate. Dude, I got a river of flame here.

316
00:59:48,460 --> 01:01:08,010
Oh, you stand up. Do you stand up like your friend does? He does stand up. I don't think he stands

317
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:25,780
up. That's the difference. It's annoying. It has a lot of health. What the fuck? Oh, what the fuck?

318
01:01:26,340 --> 01:03:22,949
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Hey, I dodged it.

319
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:44,650
I didn't. Oh, another dragon heart and I got nothing called moon veil. Moon veil.

320
01:04:03,929 --> 01:04:32,869
Int and deck scaling katana. Really? Wow. It has a magic slash. Shit, this thing's fucking crazy.

321
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:47,260
Chief blade holding it at the hip in a composed stance. Follow up with either a normal or a strong

322
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:59,320
attack to draw the blade at great speed. Both attacks fire a wave of light. Oh, my whole body

323
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:19,610
just like got like cold. What does it take to level up? It's fast. It's fast as fuck too.

324
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:34,119
That's a huge one. I wonder how much damage that does. How much man does it take? That goes far

325
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:39,480
and look at that's a huge wave. That doesn't take very much mana. I wonder how much it does.

326
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:54,389
And it has bleed. Are you kidding me? It's a magic bleed weapon. This is the best int weapon in the

327
01:05:54,389 --> 01:06:16,389
game. What the fuck? It hits like a truck. All right, dude. Okay, for now, let's I got to put up

328
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:24,650
but the carrion knight sword has been passed down for generations. The carrion knight blade is like

329
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:37,900
so it's a regal and look at it's both best in the game. Yeah, I know that's subjective. Well,

330
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:44,139
I need to go investigate that because if that's the case, if that's the case, then I might have

331
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:47,579
to actually use it. I need to see how much damage that magic part of it does though.

332
01:06:48,460 --> 01:07:03,340
Well, that's really cool. Passed down for generations. Well, I mean, I yeah, this wasn't

333
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:12,039
passed down to me. I took it off of some guy. Oh, passed down for generations. I like I kind of

334
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:28,199
just took this off a guy's body. Oh, do I really? Am I that attached? Okay, let's do a little I need

335
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:31,880
to do an investigative work here. I it's not going to do that much damage that I don't have enough to

336
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:46,090
I need one point in strength. But how much damage does that do? 173. How big is the arc?

337
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:06,889
That's a big arc. He's serious, dude. I can't even I'm not like that. I'm legally not even

338
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:11,909
allowed to have this like on right now. And I'm still like, all right, no, no more testing.

339
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:34,789
I don't know. I don't know. You're too handing it so you get the benefits. Okay, okay.

340
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:50,619
Cool weld. It looks cool. It is cool. It's like a like a see through. It's like bubbles.

341
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:58,470
It's like styrofoam. I have a styrofoam sword. This is kind of weird. It's just styrofoam.

342
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:14,149
Am I sure this is actually hurting people? Do not use it. All right, let me I want to see what it

343
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:19,210
what it takes to upgrade. Because I can have a couple weapons, right? But let me all right,

344
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:40,819
let me clear this from I did that there. Bro, watch out. There's a snake. Good kidding. See

345
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:47,380
through brain Andy. Let me clear that. And then all right, do I go back to the Smith?

346
01:09:47,939 --> 01:09:54,090
Is there anything else over here that I marked? I don't think so. No. I just had a panic attack

347
01:09:54,090 --> 01:10:00,979
for one second. I actually thought I actually thought that I was going here. I was like, oh,

348
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:08,500
I have to go fight that guy on the radan guy. I beat him. Thank God. All right. What was next

349
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:16,659
on the list of like my cleanup list? Here, I wanted to see what this was. So we're gonna go

350
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:28,539
there. Yeah, I did. I fight I fight it over Dan. And he he wouldn't take me about three or four

351
01:10:28,539 --> 01:10:41,430
hours to beat him. planning all the way. hating the game the whole way. So this way, I get up.

352
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:50,229
Oh, no, nevermind. I don't Is there even a way to get up there? It doesn't look like it. I don't

353
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:56,979
think I can get there from here. If you have to go from here. Whatever. Okay. Alright, nevermind.

354
01:10:57,619 --> 01:11:02,409
Where's three? Three was this I was like, what's this thing? This is kind of weird thing. What's

355
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:33,420
that? Let's go find out. You please play Lego GTA. Stupid game. Finish Ronnie's quest. Yeah,

356
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:39,260
after I clean up these waypoints, I'm going to go to the Smith. I'm going to see what I have

357
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:46,699
available and see if I want to potentially upgrade that katana. I also need 12 strength.

358
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:59,510
I don't know. I'm not sure yet. It's definitely available. Alright, so what is here? Play Lego

359
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:15,770
elven room. Let's explore this island. frames are still dropping. Yeah, they are and they're

360
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:22,010
going to continue to. It's some something going on with the twitch servers right now.

361
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:43,159
I've confirmed it is not my internet. This seek three wise beasts. Tetsu's rise. You must solve

362
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:54,729
the puzzle to enter. Seek three wise beasts. Oh, we're just never doing this one.

363
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:37,100
Kill three turtles. Oh my god, the whole island is here. God, get off me. How many people are

364
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:49,159
just gonna spawn here? I mean, I'll take the souls. There's not stop. Let's farm here for a minute.

365
01:13:49,159 --> 01:14:15,609
Why not? So I'm just gonna farm here. What? Oh, I thought I had the sword out. Oh my god,

366
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:21,930
what? They're not giving you any souls. Are they not 65? That's a lot. That's not bad.

367
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:27,380
That's not bad. Then actually, it's not that. Yeah, you're right. Let's get out of here.

368
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:48,149
All right. Well, I can't do whatever this is, but I can check the back. I don't think I can do this

369
01:14:48,149 --> 01:15:00,600
yet. Oh, okay. Well, that's cool. Magic turtle. Find three wise beasts. That's a turtle right

370
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:14,180
there. What do I do? Is that it? It's definitely fine. Three wise beasts. It's actually turtle.

371
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:19,300
It actually is, isn't it? You gotta be kidding me. After all the shit that we just talked, is it?

372
01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:29,109
Oh, that was kind of mean. That's what it is. Oh my god, it's actually that.

373
01:15:30,329 --> 01:15:38,630
Let's kill the three wise beasts. It's the turtles. And then that's gonna open. All right,

374
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:53,420
where's the other turtles? That was one. They're just hiding in random trees or something.

375
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:40,060
Come on. Where are you? I know there's more. Two? Where's three? Everybody see three?

376
01:16:52,090 --> 01:17:10,819
I don't know. Other side? It's gotta be here. Like right here somewhere. Where's this third

377
01:17:10,819 --> 01:17:55,659
turtle? On the beach maybe? Over in the rocks. Where the hell are you? I don't know. Behind you.

378
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:56,810
There's one more turtle. I need to find it. Oh shit! Do I have to get them again? I just reset it.

379
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:04,199
Wait, okay. Where the fuck were they? Where were they? Where were they? I don't remember.

380
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:47,699
Object permanency. Where is this last turtle? Look over the east cliff. Thank you. Thank you.

381
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:57,020
I don't- I'm not playing where's Waldo for like another fucking five minutes. East cliff? This is

382
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:10,489
the east cliff right here. I swear to god damn god man. Just teleport quick before I fall off.

383
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:26,180
I have to start the puzzle again? I'm just gonna sprint as fast as I can.

384
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:32,010
Oh, it's because I have to activate it. Right. Okay, because all those guys didn't spawn.

385
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:38,890
Seek three wise beasts. Okay, where are they?

386
01:20:43,449 --> 01:20:46,600
I'm just waiting for one of them to go.

387
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:55,640
Oh, I'm awake. They always sleep and they always wake up and have a white beard. Where are they?

388
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:26,340
Oh, there's the dog mouth too. It's like- all right, let me at least get the other ones.

389
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,020
Where's this last one? This last one's gonna be like a suction cup down a wall. I know it.

390
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:39,899
It's gonna be so stupid. Are you sure that they are- I reset it because I don't see the one in

391
01:21:39,899 --> 01:22:22,569
the tree anymore. He's in a bush next to the stairs. You lying motherfucker. There's no turtle

392
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:31,850
in this bush dude. East- it's off the side of a cliff. Southwest cliff. Southwest cliff. Southwest

393
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:50,199
cliff. Southwest cliff. Oh my goodness gracious. I have a confession to make. I thought that was a

394
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:55,560
sickle on the compass and I was wondering what the hell that was the whole game. It's S.

395
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:13,979
Southwest cliff. I thought that was like a sickle and it was like oh this is some kind of a sickle

396
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:17,979
enemy or a sickle thing. They're like- I don't know what it was. That doesn't look like an S.

397
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:23,270
Okay, southwest cliff. This is southwest. Here's the cliff.

398
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:50,810
Right? This southwestern cliff. I hear magical sounds near the edge. I'm just gonna look up from

399
01:23:50,810 --> 01:24:03,079
here. Stop throwing. I'm looking for a turtle that is randomly in a spot here and I can't find this

400
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:11,579
little bastard, okay? Southwest cliff. Why am I still in combat? I can't even look at my fucking

401
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:51,590
map. Wrong side. This is the southwestern- look at the compass! It's just- where the fuck is this

402
01:24:51,590 --> 01:25:15,189
thing? It's not on a cliff. Look at the map. I know- I know- people- I feel like people are

403
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:24,520
fucking baiting me. I need to- I'm gonna circle the whole goddamn island. I'm not- dude, southwest

404
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:36,869
cliff! Yeah, last time I did that I fell off the edge. This- I am at the southwest part of the map

405
01:25:36,869 --> 01:26:11,449
right now. I don't see a turtle. Like, you mean out here? He just looked at it? Flying above you.

406
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:34,789
No, it is not. It's not a blimp. It's a turtle. Go on the cliff. I am at sea level right- I'm not

407
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:44,949
supposed to be yelling. I'm currently at sea level right now. South cliff. Look down. There's no cliff

408
01:26:45,029 --> 01:26:50,310
on the southwestern part. South cliff. Look down. I'm gonna listen to that person.

409
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,800
There's no southern cliff. It all leads down to sea level.

410
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:29,850
Where are you? Where are you? Dude, it was right there. Right side of the tower. Run along the edge.

411
01:27:32,069 --> 01:27:39,779
The edge of the tower or the edge of the map? Like, the cliff. Oh my god, it is stupid motherfucker.

412
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:21,539
I thought- I thought he was gonna be like- like, suctioned on the edge. Okay, I get it. What's in

413
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:31,260
here? This is very intriguing. Very intriguing. Seek three wise beasts. I can't believe it was

414
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:50,119
wise beasts. We just had a whole rant about that. Okay, so what the hell's here? Do you think- oh,

415
01:28:50,119 --> 01:28:53,560
question mark, question mark. Do you think turtles have suction powers? LOL, what an idiot.

416
01:28:54,779 --> 01:29:03,960
One of them was in a fucking tree. I don't know very many tortoises that can climb trees

417
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:22,390
and get to the top of the fucking tree. Is that for your logic? Oh, wait. Oh, hold on. Can I get

418
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:35,739
over there? Oh, look at this. Oh, look what's over here. Really? Come on. Is there something I can

419
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:49,689
do about this? Where's the shot? Wait, illusory wall. Don't tell him what to do. Let him lose on

420
01:29:49,689 --> 01:30:02,409
his own. Okay, fine. That's interesting. Gonna be a teleporter. Oh, another spell- another memory

421
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:09,670
stone. That's it? That's kind of cool. That's kind of cool. It's a little puzzle to get a memory

422
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:27,380
stone. This is definitely a place where online messages make a big difference, yeah. Lugades

423
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:34,100
is probably the hardest boss in the game. Oh, I hear- yeah, yeah. General Lugades. That guy's nuts.

424
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:49,430
Crazy. That's a crazy fight. Okay, so that's cool. As I did want to check that out, I wanted to

425
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:55,829
see what that was. I also wanted to see what this was before we continue on our on our main

426
01:30:55,829 --> 01:31:13,180
quest here. Very curious what that boulder thing is. Very curious about it. Are we in the end game

427
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:23,270
now? No, I don't think we'll be in the end game for quite a while. All right, what is this big boulder?

428
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:58,229
Royal Grave Evergale. Go to Evergale. Yes. Okay. Alabaster Lord? What did this guy come from?

429
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:13,529
Oh, shit. That's all right. All right. All right. All right. All right, Mr. Lord.

430
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:42,600
Not bad. I got magic of my own. See how it works against you. That was- that staggered him too.

431
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:54,340
Hold on. Get a better one. That not even hurt me. That did. All right, now we're fucking around.

432
01:32:54,899 --> 01:33:33,689
No more testing. No more theories. Let's go to phase two. Okay, so that doesn't do damage,

433
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:45,350
but just knocks you down. Oh, okay. He kind of reversed a long way. Oh, boy. This bad.

434
01:33:46,310 --> 01:34:43,130
All right. That wasn't that bad. Alabaster Lord. Meteorite. Cool. That's just- that's just a boss.

435
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:52,090
It's just like a phantom boss thing. Let me see what that looks like. I can use this now. 30 in.

436
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:58,170
All small meteorites down from the sky. Someone's avoid that in his reign of small meteorites hold

437
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:05,050
to continue the effect. I definitely want to try it. I've- wait, you haven't done any- I've not done-

438
01:35:05,050 --> 01:35:11,479
that's- I didn't even know they existed. How many more of these are there? Is that the first Evergale

439
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:22,060
he's seen? Yeah. There's a lot of these? There are dozens of these. Okay, let me ask a question. I

440
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:28,220
have a question for everybody watching. Did I, like- because I spent a lot of time exploring

441
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:35,699
in the first stream or two, did I just go the route to avoid every single possible interesting

442
01:35:35,699 --> 01:35:46,899
thing? Did that- how did I miss everything? I did so much exploring. I did, like, I did a bunch of

443
01:35:46,899 --> 01:35:52,979
dungeons and, like, I looked down here, the burnt ruins. I didn't find any of this stuff. It was a

444
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:58,920
required item that I was supposed to find. I just didn't even know it existed until, like, literally

445
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:16,630
fucking 12 hours ago. You can fight these? Okay. Well, that's cool. You explored armpits when the

446
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:22,470
full body was exposed. That's, like, weird. That was a weird thing. I don't even know what I said.

447
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:26,229
That was a weird thing to say. That was a very weird thing to say. I don't even know what you're

448
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:30,869
saying. That was weird. That was a very odd way to put that and, like, I don't know. It's freaking me

449
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:38,840
out. You explored the armpit when the whole body was exposed. What's that supposed to mean?

450
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,979
What's that supposed to mean? That's freaking me out. I don't know what that means.

451
01:36:44,619 --> 01:36:49,000
Did you expect a serious answer? Yes. I know this is a very serious community.

452
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:58,920
Okay. Pretty cool. I think I've tied up all the loose ends. There's one more loose end that I

453
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:02,439
want to tie up and I just want to get the map fragment for here because it's, like, come on.

454
01:37:03,079 --> 01:37:14,869
Really? Try the meteor? Yeah. Yeah. You want to try the meteor? Okay. I'll try it. Sure. Okay.

455
01:37:14,869 --> 01:37:41,180
Let's see what it does. It shoots me in random directions?

456
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:50,310
This is fucking terrible. Hold on. Does it? If I lock on, will it? Let's test it over here.

457
01:37:51,029 --> 01:38:08,220
I wonder if I lock on. All right. Let's see what happens here. That might be the worst move in the

458
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:34,579
game. I didn't hit any single person. It's probably good against big enemies. I guess maybe if you cast

459
01:38:34,579 --> 01:38:50,649
right in front of them maybe. That's a lot. I thought it was a different spell. I thought it

460
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:57,430
was one that, like, shot little ones. It says small meteors. Those are huge. Okay. Well,

461
01:38:57,430 --> 01:39:02,869
it's not very good, but maybe it'll be good in random scenarios. I need... I'm going to get to

462
01:39:02,869 --> 01:39:21,850
25 vigor. Do I have enough... So what? What? Oh, wait. I got a new great rune. What does Rodan's

463
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:27,960
great rune do? The void of any benediction. Seek the divine tower of Kaelid, which stands upon the...

464
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:33,579
I think I have to talk to the finger lady. Yeah. Let's go talk to the finger lady. Upgrade strength.

465
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:43,189
Wait. Do what I came here for. I could, yeah, I could go to the dragon thing.

466
01:39:43,829 --> 01:39:58,039
But those are all faith moves. And Rodan's soul weapons. Yeah. Let me get the map fragment.

467
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:13,319
Should do the katana. I'm going to make a very, very hard decision. I'm going to make a decision.

468
01:40:13,319 --> 01:40:38,460
Not going to be easy. Lunaria East. Finally, I can see what the hell's going on here. I wonder

469
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:47,819
how much further up this goes. You know what I mean, Vern? All right. Time to head back to the

470
01:40:47,819 --> 01:41:14,979
blacksmith and make some decisions. This is not going to be easy. I don't have enough to level up

471
01:41:14,979 --> 01:41:24,840
one time, but I could get it pretty easily. I also need to... Let me do this while I'm here as well.

472
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,210
Greetings. Are you here for spirits? There's something you should know.

473
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:34,409
I need to warn you about something. A little while ago, someone started lurking in the wing

474
01:41:34,409 --> 01:41:40,409
on the opposite side of the round table. And I can hear, from all the way over there,

475
01:41:40,409 --> 01:41:49,260
a thing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive twisted malice in itself.

476
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:54,460
A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony. I can't even imagine

477
01:41:54,939 --> 01:42:01,500
how much suffering inflicted to who knows how many souls. Not even the crafting caused anything

478
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:06,460
like this to happen. You should keep your distance. I know you're strong, but please.

479
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:14,630
Wait, what? There's like a boss in here? This little one.

480
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:20,140
But you want to give me a little friend?

481
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,699
I'll be glad if you'll come to me, I think.

482
01:42:22,699 --> 01:42:41,210
Favorite jellyfish. All right, let's get the boys up. I need Ghost Glovewort II to even do Oleg.

483
01:42:42,170 --> 01:43:04,819
Boys love free. I'll do the wolves as well. Level the boys up, yeah. I'm curious what

484
01:43:04,819 --> 01:43:12,619
she's talking about. I'm gonna go take a look. All right, so...

485
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:24,060
So, somber smithing stone 6 is what I need to get this to plus 6. I also need to start

486
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:31,659
upgrading. I gotta get this upgraded. My scaling is such shit. What does it take to get Katana

487
01:43:31,659 --> 01:44:11,880
upgraded? Also, somber smithing stone. That's C scaling, C and C. All right, all right, all right,

488
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:33,619
hold on. This is 150, 150 plus 29, 38. The scaling is so much higher. And with the strength,

489
01:44:33,619 --> 01:44:45,500
it would be, it'll be fine. What does more? 137 plus 62 plus the bleed. Yeah, I'm gonna put a

490
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:51,579
point in strength. It's, yeah. It's time to put the, uh, carrion knight sword to rest, because that's

491
01:44:51,579 --> 01:45:03,159
D and D scaling. This is C and C scaling. It's like, well, is this a no-brainer? That's a

492
01:45:03,159 --> 01:45:15,430
no-brainer. I'm gonna miss this little guy, but this thing just seems way too good. All right,

493
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:25,859
I just need a point in strength. And I'm also going to do this too, because where's that staff

494
01:45:25,859 --> 01:45:36,890
that I want to eventually use? It's here. Okay, somber smithing stone. I can do it again. Get this

495
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:48,550
to plus four, which I'm going to do. I want to equip, it's almost an S scaling, bro. My current

496
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:53,189
staff does not use somber smithing stones, so I'm just going to use the regular ones on here.

497
01:45:53,829 --> 01:46:21,539
So I need, I need six. Uh, bro. Okay, now I've got to, what do I gotta do? What was I gonna do?

498
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:28,229
What the hell am I doing? There's something very specific I wanted to do.

499
01:46:29,529 --> 01:46:38,020
What was it? Oh, the, uh, the boss soul and the finger lady. Go find out what the deal is.

500
01:46:38,819 --> 01:46:56,260
All right, what's the radan boss soul? Cause I'll just crush it. Okay. This is just a huge strength

501
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:05,300
weapon and a bow though. That's kind of cool. I am great bow. Star color cry. Bring the,

502
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:18,279
wait, it's two swords. You pull people, you pull them in. The great bro is pretty pog.

503
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:26,729
Radan's rain. Archery skill performed from a low stance. Oh, it shoots. It does the arrow move.

504
01:47:28,279 --> 01:47:40,020
Sucks. Okay. Uh, I'm just going to crush it for souls. That's really cool though.

505
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:51,029
Oh, don't what? Let me don't. Why is everybody going? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't,

506
01:47:51,029 --> 01:48:08,390
don't. Why not? Wait, what are his namesake? I'm not by the finger reader. Yeah. Or used to gain

507
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:18,710
a great bounty of ruins. What are you talking about? What are you guys talking about? That's a lot.

508
01:48:19,670 --> 01:48:22,869
Okay. That's, that actually just helps me a lot. Big time. All right. So we can get strength.

509
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:34,579
Yeah. If you're not going to use the boss weapon, then just remove it. Let's point

510
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:38,739
one point in strength. That's, and I can do one point strength and we'll do, uh,

511
01:48:38,739 --> 01:48:48,470
I'll get 25 vitality. Good. All right. We've got a new weapon and I'm ready to check it out.

512
01:48:49,109 --> 01:49:01,449
Somebody do some math with me here though. I need a calculator.

513
01:49:02,329 --> 01:49:12,739
137 plus 62. That's there. It's 67, 80, 90. That's one 99 and one 15. That's 29,

514
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:26,970
one 25, 35, 36, 7, 8, 9, 41, 2, 3, 4, 144 and one 99 versus one 81, one 90.

515
01:49:27,609 --> 01:49:39,350
But it has bleed and it's also as the magic built into it's close.

516
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:56,819
This also is, is it not leveled up? Oh, it just, it just says it there. That's cool. Okay.

517
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:13,699
Three 72, three 44. Okay. But it does have the bleed and it's also plus four when the

518
01:50:13,699 --> 01:50:27,750
carrying a sword is plus five. So fuck it. Let's go. I'll use it now. Very important. I need to,

519
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:48,220
uh, talk to you about something. I can get his helmet. That's kind of cool. I can also get his

520
01:50:48,220 --> 01:51:00,420
lion armor. Holy shit. That's a lot of defense. Look at the robustness increases intelligence

521
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:24,619
by how much, by how much is this thing increases intelligence, but it makes me, it makes me slower.

522
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:36,579
My stamina is gone. It's the same. Okay. But hold on. So I get my stamina back.

523
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:51,770
Fucking idiot. This is going to just, I'm, I'm going to tell you, this is distracting.

524
01:51:51,770 --> 01:52:08,090
This is very distracting. That's going to, it gets, it's like, it's in the way. It's actually in

525
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:17,350
the way. You look like a coat hanger. I look like a moron and it's takes up too much of the screen.

526
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:31,399
Real estate. I don't like it. Fucking idiot. Well, I have to like put on other clothes then, right?

527
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:44,859
I just look like I'm about to go to sleep. I'm wearing pajamas. This is like, okay. Do you

528
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:49,579
know like back in like the, like the 1910s, this is like the pajamas that people would wear. They'd

529
01:52:49,579 --> 01:52:59,720
wear like the pajama hat and pajamas. Okay. Well, whatever. It's better than it is actually

530
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:09,189
statistically better than what I had on the carrying night stuff back on. I'll keep the

531
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:28,300
dunce cap on. Now I got my new weapon. I've got my new stuff. It's time to continue the video game

532
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:36,979
and that means go find the shooting star that landed down here somewhere. I'm going to continue

533
01:53:36,979 --> 01:53:58,199
Ranny's quest. You look like a Frito. Okay. I definitely don't want that. I'll put this on.

534
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:10,149
Yeah. All right. Let's go like here. We're looking for a star fallen star. Anybody sees it? Please

535
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:44,500
let me know right there. Look in the sky and it would be on the ground. Something here, man. Hold

536
01:54:44,500 --> 01:55:11,319
on. Oh, I thought that was a bush. I thought that was a bush. He's stuck in the thing. He's

537
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:27,159
actually stuck in the wall. Perfect. Holy shit. This thing's fucking incredible. This weapon is

538
01:55:27,159 --> 01:55:45,079
unbelievable. It is a place to go down here. Very cool. Let's do it. Katana. Good. Katana. Good.

539
01:55:45,079 --> 01:55:51,180
Yes. Katana. Very good. Well, let me put the purpose. I've been saying magic Katana. Very good.

540
01:55:52,890 --> 01:56:10,060
Axe talisman enhances charge attacks. That doesn't count for like this, right? It's only this.

541
01:56:11,659 --> 01:56:26,460
That's really cool. It's just R2 attacks. Okay. That's still cool though. I feel like I would

542
01:56:26,460 --> 01:56:35,260
want to remember that for me strong because holding R2 with like a big gigantic club because

543
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:40,779
that's the weapon I'm going to use the big huge like turkey leg. All right. Well, that was cool.

544
01:56:41,579 --> 01:57:07,699
Very cool. All right. Looking for a star shooting star East East. I feel like it would be glowing

545
01:57:07,699 --> 01:57:15,899
and really, really visible on like the whole map, right? I don't think it's something that I have

546
01:57:15,899 --> 01:57:41,460
to go searching for desperately or maybe I do. Maybe it's tiny. Is that it? It looks like down

547
01:57:41,539 --> 01:57:54,470
here. Did it make a big crater? Can I jump down there? Go down. Jump. Is this going to kill me?

548
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:02,970
Okay. I thought I was going to put with like a magical realm or something.

549
01:58:03,529 --> 01:58:21,539
I thought it was going to be a magical realm. I didn't know. How do I get down?

550
01:58:21,539 --> 01:58:32,859
If there's a, there's literally a path down there. Oh, I don't know. This guy's got literal brain

551
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:43,989
rot. I don't look, I don't know. It looks very magical down there. Plus it was a little fog.

552
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:47,989
It's not, it's not so foggy right now. Do you see how much fog was covering this whole thing?

553
01:58:47,989 --> 01:59:09,399
I can actually see now. What? It wasn't, it was like a thousand ruins or something.

554
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:15,270
Okay. Uh, the fall damage in this game, I got to tell you, I don't make no much sense to me.

555
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:30,250
You either die or you take like five damage. This is where I jumped from. That's not that far.

556
01:59:37,850 --> 02:00:09,220
That's not that far. That was a Reddit comment. This is crazy though. It's cool. How about,

557
02:00:21,239 --> 02:01:28,470
oh, I got to go over there. Oh, fuck. What the fuck?

558
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:43,130
You guys, this is going on magical down here. What? I thought it was magical.

559
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:51,060
Yeah. I thought it was like magical or something. Like there's nowhere else to go.

560
02:01:51,060 --> 02:02:09,479
Where else do you go? He's always frowning. I don't, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be

561
02:02:09,479 --> 02:02:53,420
doing here. It's, I definitely have to go this way, but I don't understand where. Don't do it again.

562
02:02:57,829 --> 02:03:35,590
I'm getting laughed at. I'm getting actually laughed at. I'm getting laughed at. Dude,

563
02:03:35,590 --> 02:03:47,100
just play worms. Okay. What's happening? What keeps happening here? This game's too hard.

564
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:51,100
This game's too hard. All right. What keep, what, what the fuck actually keeps happening to me?

565
02:03:51,739 --> 02:03:58,060
I don't, what's going on here? I keep getting here and then my brain goes nowhere. Go lose that way

566
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:07,899
left. See how fucking foggy it is here. Dude. It's so foggy. I couldn't see this.

567
02:04:08,699 --> 02:04:46,699
It's too foggy. I couldn't see it. Are you malding? Yeah, dude. Oh, oh, oh yeah.

568
02:04:47,420 --> 02:05:00,460
Are you balding? Yeah. Not that rapidly though. I'll probably have here for a while.

569
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:11,750
Probably into my like forties. It's gotta be a, a touch stone thing here, right?

570
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:18,579
Bonfire. If it's not, then like, I'm sorry, but the developers like seriously made a fucking big

571
02:05:18,579 --> 02:05:25,689
mistake. If there's not a bonfire down here, then like, I mean, the devs made a fucking massive

572
02:05:25,689 --> 02:05:28,810
mistake. And like, if I was on the team, I'd probably know how to do, I'd probably fix it.

573
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:42,500
You know what I mean? If I was like one of the devs, I would like know what to do. Like this,

574
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:46,579
this part here, like I'm not a fucking big fan of that. Like man, if I was on the team, I'd fuck,

575
02:05:46,579 --> 02:05:53,109
I'd fix that quick. The small animation cancel at the end there. I would have fixed that if I was

576
02:05:53,109 --> 02:06:14,149
on the team. What is he talking about? I'm doing the thing where like when you suck at Dark Souls,

577
02:06:14,149 --> 02:06:18,229
you talk about how like the game's not good and you would explain why like, and how you're

578
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:30,520
going to fix it. And like, you would know so much better. Oh, this is we're now. Okay. I get it.

579
02:06:31,159 --> 02:06:48,859
I get it. Be careful. All right. Dual headphones going in. You explain the joke minus two.

580
02:06:49,579 --> 02:06:53,340
Sometimes you have to because people think I'm actually sitting here doing that.

581
02:06:58,550 --> 02:07:15,420
I'm sorry. I'm not going to fall. No, I am going to look for secrets.

582
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:21,180
Oh, you go. Gross you.

583
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:35,689
What was that? People genuinely think souls games are perfect. No, they're not.

584
02:07:36,899 --> 02:07:57,670
Absolutely not. Radan is in the game. It's not perfect. This is weird.

585
02:07:58,869 --> 02:08:11,210
Holy shit. I thought I just walked off the edge. Whoa. It's just like the thing from clay fighter,

586
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:27,050
the blob was his name. Oh my goodness. Be careful. Yep. Yep. Yep.

587
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:41,670
Oh, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt. If it gets that reference.

588
02:08:43,579 --> 02:08:59,819
You're, uh, you're a real one. That's literally from clay fighter. We were just talking about it.

589
02:08:59,819 --> 02:09:13,430
I can't believe some people just don't get it. What's that? Silver tear husk.

590
02:09:13,430 --> 02:09:24,939
Stop doing that or I'm going to fucking tell on you.

591
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:46,710
Those guys are fucking terribly easy. Just get them. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

592
02:09:46,710 --> 02:10:01,560
Come here. Come here. Come here. I still get it. Right. I win. Right. Ascent butterfly.

593
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:32,550
Next game. I fall through this. Okay. For a second, I thought I was avoiding that accidentally.

594
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:38,979
One of them, maybe you can go right through. I wouldn't be surprised.

595
02:10:39,539 --> 02:10:48,539
When is Elden Ring going to come out? Um, I don't know, dude. Check your fucking local listings.

596
02:10:48,539 --> 02:11:14,180
Leave me the fucking line. Cool. You just got to type in, go to walmart.com and type in Elden Ring

597
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:37,140
PC CD ROM. Okay. I don't know. I don't know when it's coming out. Is that what I need?

598
02:11:37,140 --> 02:11:54,460
No, it's somber smithing stone five. Pretty cool. We use the CD. I don't know very many people that

599
02:11:54,460 --> 02:12:12,550
still have a CD drive on their computer. Uh, is this safe? I don't think this is safe. Is it? I'm

600
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:31,960
kind of scared to do this. I don't think this is safe. This kind of frames. Yeah. I don't,

601
02:12:32,970 --> 02:12:38,649
I'm sorry guys. There's nothing I can do about it. If I could fix it, I would.

602
02:12:38,729 --> 02:12:43,050
Something with a lot of people on Twitch's connections streaming to Twitch right now,

603
02:12:43,050 --> 02:13:20,699
it's not good. That's seriously like unfucking good. Damn, that's good. It's better on mobile.

604
02:13:21,420 --> 02:13:29,750
Um, I, it's, it's my connection to Twitch, whatever is wrong. But I would originally

605
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:35,670
be kind of concerned about this. But according to what a lot of you guys have told me, this is not

606
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:55,159
just a me problem. Cause when I do a speed test, it's perfect. Okay. I can't level up

607
02:13:55,159 --> 02:14:06,090
for anything. So what I, something I do want to do, I want to get rid of this enhances left hand

608
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:16,550
shield damage. How much though? By what? Either that or maybe starlight. I feel like I'll need

609
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:37,989
it at some point. What about Glenstone arc? I have Glenstone arc as this weapon, so I don't need it

610
02:14:37,989 --> 02:14:56,600
anymore because I have it baked into this weapon. It's pretty damn good. Something tells me I'm

611
02:14:56,600 --> 02:15:02,140
about to fight something here. I'm getting very concerned about it. I'm getting very concerned.

612
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:22,859
Please don't curse. Yeah. All right. I'll do my best. If I think about cursing, I'll just,

613
02:15:22,859 --> 02:15:34,579
I'll mute. Glove ward. It is ghost glove ward. That's exactly what I needed to upgrade. Oh, like,

614
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:53,270
I don't know if it's exact this one though. This is a boss area. It has to be. So let's prepare.

615
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:06,869
The audio is completely out of sync. I think it's because the stream keeps like hiccuping

616
02:16:07,989 --> 02:16:39,780
and I think it's happening on the browser. Hey, oh, stop. Oh, stop it. Oh, stop. I don't know what

617
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:52,600
happens when that fills up, but I don't want to, I don't want to find out process frost. Okay.

618
02:16:53,319 --> 02:17:11,819
So it just makes me slow. Not a big, not a big deal. Ghost glove ward pickers bell bearing.

619
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:24,790
I can bring that to the store. That's kind of cool. All right. I can read it in the store

620
02:17:26,729 --> 02:17:31,510
that five times fast. Ghost pickle bell bearing. Ghost sword pickle bell.

621
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:48,840
I don't know what it was. Let's check this side. I want to miss anything.

622
02:17:56,360 --> 02:18:08,139
shit. All right. I was close to my boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.

623
02:18:08,139 --> 02:18:12,059
Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. That was a record. I think

624
02:18:12,299 --> 02:18:41,139
this channel at least that was probably at least 10 plus times in a row what other channels do that

625
02:18:42,340 --> 02:18:47,139
i'm just saying in general i can't claim to have the record because somebody probably did it a

626
02:18:47,139 --> 02:19:09,750
hundred times in a row that's mad damage that's actually that's actually just mad that's mad

627
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:19,850
damage i like this area's music it's very blood-borne-y that leg

628
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:55,420
great one two that's five great shield boys interesting tank boys all right so i can go

629
02:19:55,420 --> 02:20:16,219
in here i could go down there let's see what's in here can't replace the boys i can at least get them

630
02:20:16,219 --> 02:20:26,469
so plus three marvel tier i'm gonna do an item uh like recap essentially i picked up a lot of

631
02:20:26,469 --> 02:20:36,309
stuff in the last like hour okay i think that's everything i'm gonna go down there is a desync

632
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:45,239
i i don't think there is i think i don't see it on my uh preview i honestly think it's the internet

633
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:59,700
shit that was happening with twitch's servers oh shit okay there's a boss here one of those statues

634
02:21:02,950 --> 02:21:12,680
hmm i think i level up first yeah definitely i have enough runes i think to put

635
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:15,559
another point into intelligence which is what i'm gonna do

636
02:21:20,549 --> 02:21:32,760
oh fuck out of here

637
02:21:39,350 --> 02:22:04,979
big whip do i get the whip you kissed erba i already have what that was a different whip though

638
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:11,879
that was a like a chain it almost looked magical a magical whip would be kind of fun

639
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:23,879
hmm yeah i definitely can level up for uh going in there without a doubt so that's what we're gonna

640
02:22:23,879 --> 02:23:13,620
do another larval tier oh i need that's why i don't have the arc i have it already i think

641
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:18,020
that's all i can do but i'm gonna level up unless because there's a statue back there so that's what

642
02:23:18,020 --> 02:23:23,940
they want you to respawn after you die a multitude of times here i do have to pee too so we're gonna

643
02:23:23,940 --> 02:23:37,430
take a break before doing whatever the heck this is yeah all right i'm going back to the bonfire

644
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:52,920
i gotta pee whoa what did i just go what no that's not what i wanted to do

645
02:23:53,639 --> 02:24:11,420
what happened what it's the wrong one what's the right one this one here okay yeah this is the

646
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:17,979
right one all right uh let me see if i can level up yeah i have so many of these it's gonna be 5k

647
02:24:17,979 --> 02:24:44,280
okay 23 000 24 000 i believe it's 24 or 23 23 okay i gotta kill a couple things

02:37:47,770 --> 02:38:04,739
one person i know more than anybody it's me i wouldn't have done that that's how i know you're

684
02:39:55,719 --> 02:40:01,479
timing on this i don't fucking understand time oh good one good okay you're learning

685
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:23,420
okay see how long it just took him to do that all right no more messing around time to die

686
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:52,500
larval tier silver tier mask what is that like a clay mask greatly increases arcane to the

687
02:40:52,500 --> 02:41:15,739
detriment of physical attack power by how much 17 versus oh my god that's a lot it's a lot

688
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:40,840
okay well that was not that bad maybe if he was a stronger character very cool yeah i mean i we

689
02:41:40,840 --> 02:41:46,120
might have to come up with like a command for like the frames or something like like exclamation

690
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:51,299
point frames and just have like they have like a corporate response like i don't understand what's

691
02:41:51,299 --> 02:41:56,020
going on my internet is fine i think we've narrowed it down to possibly it's something going on on

692
02:41:56,020 --> 02:42:13,659
twitch is in bear with us all right well that leads to this which this looks like the real

693
02:42:13,659 --> 02:42:18,620
encounter coming up here this is a huge bridge there's no way that this is not the real fight

694
02:42:19,579 --> 02:42:29,750
i have 10 000 souls i'm kind of concerned about this how come no one else is losing

695
02:42:29,750 --> 02:42:34,790
frames if it's a twitch problem i don't i don't understand i thought people i thought it was

696
02:42:34,790 --> 02:42:50,819
happening to other people i can upgrade the katana those are fine they've gotten way worse

697
02:42:51,780 --> 02:43:06,420
other streams are fine i did switch servers brutal right now what the fuck is going on i

698
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:11,059
actually am dropping a huge an insane amount of frames though like it's actually really bad

699
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:21,479
this server might actually be worse it doesn't make any sense because i i have i i literally

700
02:43:21,479 --> 02:43:26,200
have a thousand megabit upload right now like i just i just did a speed test it was like 940

701
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:49,670
megabits up i don't get it should i change back to the other server it is definitely happening to

702
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:56,700
other people it is literally happening to other people don't let anyone don't listen to everybody

703
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:21,270
worse than yesterday though it's not happening it's not happening to every streamer but it's

704
02:44:21,270 --> 02:44:26,709
happening to a lot of people um that's this is like really not good though i kind of might go

705
02:44:26,709 --> 02:44:33,909
to the other server yeah let me let me try that i i changed maybe it's happening to like where like

706
02:44:33,909 --> 02:44:38,870
maybe some route is fucked up so people may be in like the i don't know in like the western part

707
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:45,110
of the country or something but let yeah this is bad like i'm i have six percent drop frames

708
02:44:45,909 --> 02:44:56,260
let me go back to the server i was on before see if it makes it even a little bit better

709
02:44:56,819 --> 02:45:02,389
because i have 6.6 percent of all frames have been dropped which that's really not that's awful

710
02:45:05,059 --> 02:45:10,250
let me refresh the stream i'll be right back see if it gets any better if i go to the place

711
02:45:10,250 --> 02:46:53,770
i was before i'll be right back don't go anywhere don't move a muscle be right back okay whoa

712
02:46:55,639 --> 02:47:07,030
holy shit i can't even connect to this server what the fuck yeah like i i'm dropping

713
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:13,420
60 percent of all my frames trying to connect to this one what the fuck is going on right now

714
02:47:13,420 --> 02:47:27,139
this is insane what i'm gonna have to connect to a i'm gonna have to go somewhere else for like

715
02:47:27,139 --> 02:47:35,770
my server what the fuck this is by the way this is the server that i use i've been using for like

716
02:47:35,770 --> 02:47:45,659
two straight years holy shit this is unbelievably bad i don't know what's going on but this is

717
02:47:46,219 --> 02:47:57,670
really really weird i'm doing a speed test right now and i do 900 down 900 up

718
02:47:58,739 --> 02:48:23,399
fuck yeah this is fucked up yeah i just did a speed test 900 900 um well we're gonna try a

719
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:42,340
different server yes there's no way i can connect to this one i will see you guys again in a moment

720
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:54,280
yeah i have officially confirmed this has nothing to do with my internet zero i just ran three or

721
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:59,579
four speed tests in a row it's perfect officially confirmed has nothing to do with my internet i'll

722
02:48:59,579 --> 02:49:03,500
be right back i'm gonna try another one uh it's not my vpn i don't have my vpn's not on

723
02:49:04,059 --> 02:50:19,370
be right back we're gonna try another server okay how are we doing are we good

724
02:50:23,209 --> 02:50:36,100
now something's still wrong it's better but it's still really bad i'm gonna stick out let's stick

725
02:50:36,100 --> 02:50:42,600
on this one for a little bit for a minute or two because this is the third server i've tried i'm

726
02:50:42,600 --> 02:51:08,540
gonna stay here for a minute let's just let's just chill out for a moment i i i have a live

727
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:19,049
monitor over here and i can see that it's it's still about 10 maybe i should turn the vpn on

728
02:51:19,690 --> 02:51:23,290
because that'll route traffic in a different way maybe because something to do with the connection

729
02:51:23,290 --> 02:51:29,459
to twitch maybe it's a good idea to just to turn the vpn on and have it just kind of go somewhere

730
02:51:29,459 --> 02:51:46,469
else and have the track of traffic come in a circle it seems better we'll give it a moment

731
02:51:46,469 --> 02:51:55,540
oh hello what can i do for you all right i'm gonna i'm not gonna go brb actually i'm technically

732
02:51:55,540 --> 02:52:01,690
gonna go brb because i think you need something uh i'm gonna sit here and see because i think it's

733
02:52:01,690 --> 02:52:10,899
all right it's definitely better than it was before at least it seems that way what are you

734
02:52:10,899 --> 02:52:19,319
doing where are you going what are you doing ato all right yeah i think he's probably just

735
02:52:19,319 --> 02:52:21,799
he just i think he wants a treat or something i would just give him a treat

736
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:32,170
oh you want a treat yeah he always wants a treat he wants a biscuit um i i'm just gonna go for it

737
02:52:37,180 --> 02:52:41,479
well the treat stream that's right me and holly we're we're actually talking about it we were

738
02:52:41,479 --> 02:52:46,819
like how are we gonna do like the treat tier list how are we gonna do a treat tier list i tell

739
02:52:48,680 --> 02:52:52,219
yeah it's better than it was before and we're gonna have to deal with it because i can't just

740
02:52:52,219 --> 02:53:06,100
sit here and just do nothing for like another 40 minutes so sorry about that treat stream yeah

741
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:15,000
we actually did talk about it but sorry everybody i know this is kind of annoying but it's annoying

742
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:22,700
for me too trust me but it seems to be settling down dude i don't know what's going on with the

743
02:53:22,700 --> 02:53:26,780
west coast servers maybe the josh you were saying the east coast servers are doing it too but

744
02:53:28,549 --> 02:53:32,709
i connected to the server that i've been connecting to for years and i couldn't even

745
02:53:32,709 --> 02:53:42,459
put anything through but it's okay it's all good i'm just glad it's not my problem because

746
02:53:42,459 --> 02:53:48,629
you guys know i have like traumatic experiences with my internet being terrible but thankfully

747
02:53:48,629 --> 02:54:10,309
i can confirm that it's not my internet but we continue it's a long bridge oh oh okay

748
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:19,110
we see auto um he just ran away all he gave him a treat and he's he now he doesn't care about me

749
02:54:19,829 --> 02:54:27,049
he's like hanging out with her he's incredibly food motivated wait go to the end of the bridge

750
02:54:34,819 --> 02:54:48,219
maybe a little bit later a little bit later i'll show i i will show auto i actually he did lose one

751
02:54:48,219 --> 02:55:03,510
pound but that's good i wonder if i can get down there like right there he was way too chunky

752
02:55:04,549 --> 02:55:17,829
weight like bad he's supposed to be like between like 22 and like 26 pounds yeah

753
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:28,360
he may have been uh closer to 30 so i'm glad that he's uh getting back down to like 27

754
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:34,120
we want i'm trying to get him to 26 because he's a dachshund mix so he's not he's actually

755
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:38,760
supposed to be a little he's supposed to be bigger so his ideal weight is like 24 to 26

756
02:55:40,090 --> 02:55:57,030
so he was like 28 he's down now to like 27 trying to get him down to 20 all right you get it let's

757
02:55:57,030 --> 02:56:27,100
go fuck you well these guys got a lot of health huh all shrimps get the mushrooms oh that you

759
02:56:46,979 --> 02:56:53,860

763
02:57:37,459 --> 02:57:44,090
the way that my webcam is picking up my voice like my voice comes out sometimes my voice doesn't

815
03:18:22,709 --> 03:18:26,469
the old-fashioned like dear old dad used to make that's like that's like that drink that is

816
03:18:26,469 --> 03:18:31,430
undrinkable it's probably like 40 alcohol it's probably that it's what half the drink is alcohol

817
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:42,280
don't make it so sweet this time let me show you let me show you how dear old dad used to make it

818
03:18:47,180 --> 03:19:02,059
oh no no not 40 alcohol by volume i mean like the drink is 50 alcohol and 50 something else

822
03:20:00,620 --> 03:20:20,860

824
03:20:38,620 --> 03:21:43,610
pepe laugh uh what have i done can you recommend whatever it was um oh i don't need that

825
03:21:44,729 --> 03:22:14,760
if they laugh this is like too this is too simple but what this room is this is too simple this

826
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:40,579
guy's gonna turn into like an eagle or something this person's gonna turn to an eagle ancestral

827
03:22:40,579 --> 03:22:52,940
infant's head what is that didn't it say something about that i have an item that is wait what is

828
03:22:52,940 --> 03:23:11,639
that uses fp to spray spirit vapor the vapor becomes a temporary geyser which deals continuous

829
03:23:11,639 --> 03:23:26,360
damage to everything it touches and then the helmet that i have right strengthens ancestral

830
03:23:26,360 --> 03:23:53,209
infant's head is it just one use or how does this work i'm just gonna try it that's actually kind

831
03:23:53,209 --> 03:24:03,799
of cool it's just reusable that's really actually pretty cool i wonder how much more significant it

832
03:24:03,799 --> 03:24:09,829
is if you have the helmet on all right well i'm gonna keep it on the bar because that's kind of

833
03:24:09,829 --> 03:24:19,959
cool i might use it how do i get out of here now do i have to just teleport i'm not sure i can

834
03:24:19,959 --> 03:24:30,020
like do anything about this i think i just teleport unless i'm missing something else here

835
03:24:33,110 --> 03:24:45,530

840
03:25:37,540 --> 03:25:44,649
it was we went from six point eight percent to three point five percent so i don't know what

884
03:34:49,559 --> 03:35:01,780
that's part of it let's see what this is very interesting they said there's a gate

885
03:35:01,780 --> 03:35:08,250
hidden over here it really is wow it really is kind of just buried in the corner here

886
03:35:09,129 --> 03:35:30,569
i definitely don't think i would have found this look it up regal's dragon barrow hey hey

03:35:56,659 --> 03:36:14,540
second half is here so that's interesting dragon barrel so holy shit what is that i was scared

890
03:36:14,540 --> 03:36:20,569
though that actually scared me that was terrifying to me that was terrifying why are you writing

891
03:36:20,569 --> 03:36:24,809
notes like a nerd because i'm trying to good luck keeping track of anything going on

892
03:36:29,610 --> 03:36:51,219
east yield sanctum okay so this is the guy he's like i'm gonna send you to my friend

893
03:36:57,159 --> 03:37:09,000
hand over death root let me let me first uh figure out what i'm handing them

894
03:37:09,719 --> 03:37:23,780
so i don't even know what it is death root east clergyman seeks and devours these

895
03:37:24,579 --> 03:37:40,170
where did i get this i don't know where i got that from where is that from like your notes

i said to tremble when near death root the murky violet iris writhes if it's alive

902
03:39:11,379 --> 03:39:26,329
i wonder what that that's an indicator on the screen fort farrowth in the dragon barrel

903
03:39:26,889 --> 03:39:32,579
that was kind of interesting what was the other thing give me two things flaw

904
03:39:33,540 --> 03:39:52,760
was it sometimes i like kind of wish this game had a like combat log of history that happened

happened what was it i just got it gave me two things i and the claw but what is

906
03:40:03,510 --> 03:40:40,469
it's a weapon where is it it's a talisman eighth talisman where is it didn't give me two things

907
03:40:41,030 --> 03:40:54,280
it's an offhand oh bestial incantations okay i was i'm looking around i thought it was an item

909
03:41:03,399 --> 03:41:13,959

910
03:41:13,959 --> 03:41:17,079
really cool all right let's uh this area i'm probably not supposed to be here so let's go

911
03:41:17,079 --> 03:41:36,379
ahead and like just spray this guy wait this is a boss what this is a boss that took me a while to

912
03:41:36,379 --> 03:42:13,079
figure that out i was mesmerized okay he's that's one hit i don't i don't think i'm uh

913
03:42:15,559 --> 03:42:30,040
it's a weird place to fight him too you're not hostile until you hit him well now i now i want

914
03:42:30,040 --> 03:42:47,159
to go out there and fight him i was he versus this stuff let's see very bad what if he was like oh

03:50:37,850 --> 03:50:50,899
butterflies oh frames drops only happen when you attack i think uh i think that might be

940
03:50:51,780 --> 03:51:13,690
a really interesting coincidence i wasn't make it it's your pc it's not my pc my pc's fine

941
03:51:15,780 --> 03:51:21,799
my game is playing flawlessly my internet is perfect there's nothing wrong with my face

942
03:51:21,799 --> 03:51:59,450
i have no pimples to go up where we're going oh shiny in there it's too quiet in this place

943
03:51:59,450 --> 03:52:02,940
it just is that usually means something horrible is about to happen

03:52:05,180 --> 03:52:27,299
black wet blade yep i knew it i heard it oh it's you what's that how many do i have

946
03:52:43,670 --> 03:53:02,500
why can i attack this person what's going on who is this oh it's a chest

947
03:53:07,770 --> 03:53:37,540
okay what is it wow this is gold mimic tier ashes that's a gold beam legendary ashen remains used

948
03:53:37,540 --> 03:53:46,260
to summon the spirit of a mimic tier summoning consumes hp rather than fp the spirit takes the

949
03:53:46,260 --> 03:53:51,219
form of the summoner to fight alongside them but its mimicry does not extend in imitating the

950
03:53:51,219 --> 03:54:05,420
summoner's will what do i summon a copy of myself to run around that's kind of interesting i'm

951
03:54:05,420 --> 03:54:28,569
curious this one sucks oh legs better i'll try it oh no how much does it cost to use

952
03:54:29,530 --> 03:54:33,540
that's kind of good it's literally the best summoned by a thousand miles

953
03:54:34,180 --> 03:54:42,579
because how many keys that take to get in here not that many there's only one okay we're good

997
04:08:38,459 --> 04:08:41,420
yep yep yep yep there's something well there's something weird right there i don't know what

998
04:08:41,420 --> 04:09:21,139
though what's this like smoldering rocks oh ah okay it's one more that i'm missing i think

999
04:09:21,860 --> 04:09:32,280
i don't have any idea where it could be oh no that's it is it oh i got them all all right cool

1000
04:09:32,280 --> 04:09:47,500
all right got them all i'm gonna level up first i want to get i need to get to uh all right first

1001
04:09:47,500 --> 04:10:05,909
of all just kill the people that are attacking me because some of my friend maybe i will he's

1002
04:10:05,909 --> 04:10:19,510
still fighting me this weapon is so good i didn't abandon oleg what are you talking about i'm sure

1003
04:10:19,510 --> 04:10:47,940
he'll set he'll be really useful in a lot of time a lot of places level up time this area looks

1004
04:10:47,940 --> 04:11:21,270
cool this area is really cool 25 000 i think is what i need maybe 22 20 what do i need

1005
04:11:21,270 --> 04:12:01,829
25 all right i'm gonna kill a few more people hey come on it's so good it's so good

1006
04:12:09,639 --> 04:12:29,540
that enough i think i need 25 i'll just kill this group here that's such a great move i wonder if

1007
04:12:29,540 --> 04:12:33,299
that's only good against these guys but whatever i'll take it he's just kind of a pain in the ass

1008
04:12:33,299 --> 04:12:49,030
all right that should do it it was 25 and some change hopefully it's not more than that

1009
04:12:49,670 --> 04:13:00,180
works on shield with enemies too wow that sounds fucking incredible uh health or more

1010
04:13:00,180 --> 04:13:13,110
into i'm gonna try to get health to 30 i feel like i'm really lacking in that right now all right

1011
04:13:13,750 --> 04:13:21,879
you guys ready ready let's go for it see if we can fight this thing this is another one of those

1012
04:13:21,879 --> 04:13:51,159
deer bosses something okay let's go i wonder how different this one will be

1013
04:13:51,159 --> 04:14:19,879
let's go eagle ancestor spirit is it the same fight seems to be pretty similar

1014
04:14:27,159 --> 04:15:06,409
two that's different what so this one does three what that does four

1015
04:15:06,489 --> 04:15:13,500
four that's a one two three four

1016
04:15:39,530 --> 04:16:24,600
these pigs are in the way don't be greedy i love that sound whoa what's this

1017
04:16:33,639 --> 04:16:40,540
excuse me what happened here you healed to full health oh well that's gotta stop that from

1018
04:16:40,540 --> 04:16:54,780
happening i have to stay i have to stutter that i think what the holy shit okay that was okay so

1019
04:16:54,780 --> 04:17:52,940
that it's not a big aoe move it's a heel what the fuck it's like bunny hopping is that it holy

1020
04:17:52,940 --> 04:18:41,620
fuck i thought you're gonna do the bunny hop yeah oh fuck i think it's run maybe you can dodge

1021
04:18:41,620 --> 04:19:30,549
through it no no no no no no no no no no i gotta go faster i gotta kill him faster than this

1022
04:19:31,190 --> 04:19:43,139
i just happen to be drinking all right yeah i gotta kill i gotta kill you faster than this

1023
04:19:43,139 --> 04:19:53,420
you gotta burn i gotta put the burn fight it's a burn what the fuck are you doing stop

1024
04:19:54,299 --> 04:20:48,899
this shit's a burn fight what or shit and i mean that literally fuck i could have done more hits

1025
04:20:48,899 --> 04:21:24,440
on this idiot no no no god all right all right okay okay so the dude heals and i gotta kill him

1026
04:21:24,440 --> 04:21:29,319
before he does the deal twice i gotta get when he's healing get in there whack him a bunch of

1027
04:21:29,319 --> 04:21:32,360
times i thought it was a giant aoe explosion that's why i didn't do it the first time and

1028
04:21:32,360 --> 04:21:49,620
he got full health i got him like i'm no sword skill um i feel like i could have just beaten

1029
04:21:49,620 --> 04:22:00,040
him without it i'll try it though don't even make sure you use that sheath magic i'll try it

1030
04:22:00,760 --> 04:22:20,440
he shit like that like i didn't know that now i know that i'm ready yes dead what about killing

1031
04:22:20,440 --> 04:22:27,670
the animals uh i could try it maybe it's the amount of heal he gets that's a great question

1032
04:22:27,670 --> 04:23:24,149
actually i should probably try it god damn it got greedy being stupid yep that's definitely

1033
04:23:24,149 --> 04:23:31,260
that's what it is he eats the animals he eats the animals all right i gotta i gotta run around him

1034
04:23:31,260 --> 04:23:34,940
oh come on i could have had an opportunity all right yeah i he i gotta get rid of the animals

1035
04:23:35,959 --> 04:24:16,520
he eats the animals that's what's going on here oh that's a stagger let's get him right in the

1036
04:24:16,520 --> 04:24:55,000
head see you later oops try dodge it that hurts me too all right bro fuck you

1037
04:25:05,479 --> 04:26:04,600
fuck what he added that dude what the fuck stop yes yes yes yes yes that's a remembrance

1038
04:26:07,940 --> 04:26:16,360
really okay that's actually kind of cool i wonder what that boss weapon is

1039
04:26:19,659 --> 04:26:30,489
all right really cool really really cool pretty cool pretty cool that's another level too very

1040
04:26:30,489 --> 04:26:44,489
nice i want to see what that does whatever to the burger king head uh it was kind of nerfing me

1041
04:26:44,489 --> 04:26:48,870
this thing dude this thing is the same thing as the burger king head the only difference is it

1042
04:26:48,870 --> 04:26:58,409
does not it's way less defense but this brings my stamina down 10 this doesn't it gives me the same

1043
04:26:58,489 --> 04:27:16,280
intellect increase but it's not as funny you can do this again what's that all about

1044
04:27:30,549 --> 04:27:37,350
okay so let's do let's see what the remembrance is i have to imagine this is probably sorcery

1045
04:27:38,760 --> 04:27:49,579
right because i mean think about it that was pretty much all sorcery imagining a pretty major

1046
04:27:49,579 --> 04:28:05,450
spell winged great horn axe ancestral spirits horn restores fp upon defeating enemies

1047
04:28:06,170 --> 04:28:27,610
this is a helmet or is this a talisman this is kind of huge deal how much fp does it bring back

1048
04:28:27,610 --> 04:28:46,500
because man we're gonna be needing that talisman it's only about three fp per kill is that worth it

1049
04:28:47,540 --> 04:29:05,399
i guess maybe hold on how much does it cost to how much fp does this thing use hard to tell

1050
04:29:05,399 --> 04:29:12,040
is that worth using well how much is like a just regular source removed to tell you

1051
04:29:12,840 --> 04:29:25,909
fp costs seven okay so this is 12 i get three back per kill which would mean if there's like

1052
04:29:25,909 --> 04:29:41,059
three or four enemies i don't know i don't know worth it more just to probably level up into fp

1053
04:29:41,700 --> 04:29:50,620
what else are you using your talisman slots for this one i'm not taking off for the rest of the

1054
04:29:50,620 --> 04:29:58,309
game this one i could replace because i'm using the magic on the weapon not necessarily sorceries

1055
04:29:58,309 --> 04:30:13,030
that much anymore and this is i could probably replace this one i'll get it the heal is pointless

1056
04:30:14,700 --> 04:30:32,379
i'll get it let's try it i want it let's try it we'll put it on okay bingo restores fp upon

1057
04:30:32,379 --> 04:30:59,559
defeating enemies i replaced the heel very cool well that was awesome oh oh uh ronnie do i have

1058
04:30:59,559 --> 04:31:17,100
any uh crunchies i have to be careful i do have the finger blade so i gotta bring it back to ronnie

1059
04:31:18,540 --> 04:31:39,500
see what else i have to do i want to test that talisman as well see if it's worth it okay hello

1060
04:31:42,090 --> 04:31:48,809
it was the not blithe it seemeth even in my slumber i sensed it i picked it up it is in

1061
04:31:48,809 --> 04:31:57,690
my possession is it not the hidden treasure of nokron my thanks finally all the pieces are in

1062
04:31:57,690 --> 04:32:11,659
place soon must i begin my journey on the dark path only i may tread but before i leave i shall

1063
04:32:11,659 --> 04:32:23,190
entrust you arian inverted statue nice sterling efforts what does that do a strange gift perhaps

1064
04:32:23,750 --> 04:32:31,780
but a rare source such as thee would welcome it i'm sure i am certain now fate steered us

1065
04:32:31,780 --> 04:32:38,899
to our reunion i must thank torrent too for his part you may leave now it was but brief

1066

but thou gavest me fine service what is it i too and depart on a journey

1067
04:32:48,979 --> 04:33:01,299
upon the dark path probably fight this lady so what's that he revealing the hidden form of

1068

1071
04:33:40,650 --> 04:33:53,110
this is the academy this is the carrion hall i would imagine i mean this is isn't this carrion

1072
04:33:53,110 --> 04:34:14,200
manner royal grave uh area behind carrion manner and his rise to the two towers to the right

magic downpour oh that fp item is actually helping a lot yeah it is downpour

1112
04:47:41,000 --> 04:47:57,669
magic down for some of the magic mass that sprays projectiles be cool all right well

1113
04:47:58,389 --> 04:48:02,659
now i can level up but let me see what else is okay hold on something up here

1114
04:48:03,299 --> 04:48:15,529
oh yeah i see the ladder i see the ladder from come on from what's with this like what's with

1115
04:48:15,529 --> 04:49:03,180
this weird glitch from this is dangerous hold on hold on hold on nobody do anything weird

1116
04:49:03,180 --> 04:49:35,819
what why can they walk like this oh we're good yeah all right oh shit i got some mana back

1117
04:49:35,819 --> 04:50:02,540
that's how that works there better be something good up here all right what's the least the path

1118
04:50:02,540 --> 04:50:08,790
of the least resistance here i don't know i'm gonna get spawned on they're gonna climb up

1119
04:50:08,790 --> 04:50:11,990
something i gotta be i gotta get myself situated that straightaway right there

1120
04:50:50,939 --> 04:50:58,409
boost fp restoration from flask it's really not that big of a deal that's not worth climbing

1121
04:50:58,409 --> 04:51:09,849
two ladders for that's not worth climbing two ladders for okay uh that's it nothing else here

1122
04:51:09,849 --> 04:51:16,180
i'm just gonna jump down to here i'm gonna go back down i'm gonna go up a little bit more though

1123
04:51:16,740 --> 04:51:38,310
be careful wait why uh i do want to go here though because there was another place to go

1124
04:51:39,029 --> 04:51:53,369
what is this wait no no no no no this is the way up oh i think i missed something

1125
04:51:54,330 --> 04:52:10,250
i think i missed an item maybe not no never mind

1126
04:52:23,580 --> 04:52:32,919
okay i think that's it at least well that's cool to get i'll try it out a little bit flip

1127
04:52:32,919 --> 04:52:38,279
the thing upside down go back up here and i guess do whatever i need to do for this uh

1128
04:52:39,419 --> 04:52:51,080
ron rainy quest ronnie i haven't been here for a few hours what's going on uh with that hat

1129
04:52:51,639 --> 04:52:57,159
i lost a bet with uh chat and they said that i had to wear this hat for the next three to six

1130
04:52:57,159 --> 04:53:04,759
hours of gameplay um it does it's so stupid when you put this on you take 25 more damage from all

1131
04:53:04,759 --> 04:53:11,419
sources uh it's a lot of like speed runners and like like really like hardcore gamers are going

1132
04:53:11,419 --> 04:53:16,700
to be using it because your movement speed is like 10 faster so but it's like really bad to

1133
04:53:16,700 --> 04:53:22,900
have on right now it's actually a pretty stupid thing to wear for like a first playthrough

1134
04:53:25,270 --> 04:53:29,110
and actually it might even be 30 more damage with a 10 movement speed buff

1135
04:53:45,029 --> 04:53:47,669
why do they just lie all the time i don't know because it's kind of funny

1136
04:53:48,470 --> 04:53:52,419
well i'm just making conversation but oh what's going on with you

1137
04:53:54,099 --> 04:53:57,779
oh

1138
04:54:14,419 --> 04:54:16,979
i'm gonna get this to 30 and then we're gonna do some more intelligence

1139
04:54:17,619 --> 04:54:29,380
let's check it out magic down four i'll try it see what it does

1140
04:54:36,950 --> 04:54:54,069
oh actually pretty good area denial i charge it i can charge it that's pretty good denial

1141
04:54:54,069 --> 04:54:59,049
right like i can kind of catch people up guard does like no damage yeah but it's probably good

1142
04:54:59,049 --> 04:55:16,700
to some area denial okay now let's go for it i already saw this let me check the frames i'm

1143
04:55:16,700 --> 04:55:32,299
just curious it's a pretty consistent three percent frame drop for some reason on twitch what's going

1144
04:55:32,299 --> 04:55:44,259
on with my connection to your servers what's going on here no no i don't want to do this

poison build up that fucking language that was like that language was so incorrect for me that

1216
05:24:57,930 --> 05:25:32,840
fucking language what's that remember you're gonna get an epic item come on i'll be back

1217
05:25:33,479 --> 05:26:03,240
that's poison build up say it causes wearer too consumable to be poisoned

1218
05:26:32,009 --> 05:26:36,729
poison build up i know stop saying it because it's making me fucking angry and i'm angry about it

1219
05:26:36,729 --> 05:26:47,180
and i keep seeing it is i'm i'm so yeah it's poison build up first mark of death stargazer

1220
05:26:47,180 --> 05:27:21,909
heirloom that's plus five intelligence okay i have a question is this considered a sorcery

1221
05:27:23,430 --> 05:27:27,830
or is that just magic intelligence based scaling does that consider it a sorcery

1222
05:27:28,389 --> 05:27:45,979
it's a weapon skill so it's not a sorcery it just stacks with intelligence okay so i i'm gonna lose

1223
05:27:45,979 --> 05:27:52,520
the potency but i mean that's just gonna make this weapon do so much more damage and gets me closer

1224
05:27:52,520 --> 05:28:02,490
to the other stuff but now i scale even more oh my god plus 82 holy shit all right so that's all

1225
05:28:02,490 --> 05:28:05,610
it's up here there was something else up here too what was that was like a key item or something

1226
05:28:05,610 --> 05:28:22,180
what was it what else was down there's something else here first mark carved into lunar princess

1227
05:28:22,180 --> 05:28:47,750
ronnie's discarded what that's her what happened what the hell happened also known as the half

1228
05:28:47,750 --> 05:28:53,990
wheel wound of the centipede this curse mark was carved at the moment of death of the first demi

1229
05:28:53,990 --> 05:29:01,189
god and should have taken the shape of a circle however two demi gods perished at the same time

1230
05:29:02,150 --> 05:29:06,970
breaking the curse mark into two half wheels ranny was the first of the demi gods whose

1231
05:29:06,970 --> 05:29:26,889
flesh perished while the prince of death perished in soul alone does that mean so what where do i

1458
06:43:25,380 --> 06:43:40,389
is that shit does 400 damage every time i did it now i mean the problem with this which i have

1459
06:43:40,389 --> 06:43:51,639
to be careful is it takes i kind of takes a second use the ash of war to buff its magic scaling

1460
06:43:56,680 --> 06:43:59,959
here's the crazy part right this is the most ridiculous part about this weapon

1461
06:44:03,669 --> 06:44:10,229
i have not been building this character all intelligence really i mean i put like i put

1462
06:44:10,229 --> 06:44:18,409
like 10 what 11 points in dexterity if i had just 50 points in intelligence this might be just stupid

1463
06:44:27,770 --> 06:44:38,599
you're over leveled i don't i'm only level 70 i'm not that high when i because people

1464
06:44:38,599 --> 06:44:46,459
okay his thing people said i was under leveled for radan and i was like 55 for radan this boss

1465
06:44:46,459 --> 06:44:55,159
is an earlier game boss well that makes sense too this area is but that this area has to be

1466
06:44:55,159 --> 06:45:00,759
after radan though because this is part of the witch's quest or am i just out of my mind and

1467
06:45:00,759 --> 06:45:15,380
i just found this isn't the quest this is not part of the quest oh okay so there's just there's

1468
06:45:15,380 --> 06:45:28,310
just a boss down here very cool well what was the spell i got some kind of weird like frost spell

1469
06:45:28,310 --> 06:45:40,279
or something didn't i what was it didn't i get a new spell frozen lightning spear oh it's an

1470
06:45:40,279 --> 06:45:58,380
incantation okay well that was cool that was very cool this is an area that you can get too early

1471
06:45:59,180 --> 06:46:15,930
this game is insane this guy's just down here game's insane great ghost glove ward

1472
06:46:17,459 --> 06:46:27,180
there's probably only like four of these in the game okay well that's awesome uh

1473
06:46:28,810 --> 06:46:39,099
should i just leave so much more down here uh yeah i gotta keep doing the what's what am i

1474
06:46:39,099 --> 06:46:49,130
even look what am i doing down here for rena's quest but what am i actually doing here i don't

1475
06:46:49,130 --> 06:47:15,909
know to go kill the shade thing she talked about is it down here let's go the other way

1476
06:47:16,709 --> 06:47:42,569
oh all right um so i need 29 i'll be fine so if i were to go go back over here where was that

1477
06:47:42,569 --> 06:47:52,700
area with all the red bugs and shit and my throat's been kind of annoyed cancel river main to main

1478
06:47:54,970 --> 06:47:59,209
and then head into that okay yeah my throat's been although i'm just talking a lot

1479
06:47:59,770 --> 06:48:12,250
i'll probably get some water in a minute here okay so like over here this is where i came from

1480
06:48:12,250 --> 06:48:27,220
so from here it was another way wasn't there yeah there was okay there was another way to go

1481
06:48:27,220 --> 06:48:32,250
that's right that's a whole huge area that i just was there for like an hour and a half

1482
06:48:33,209 --> 06:48:43,029
i don't know why am i fighting these people how long am i going to play tonight

1483

1499
06:57:29,049 --> 06:57:46,889
my throat too am i screaming too much maybe i got some water though i'll be all right we'll go for

1500
06:57:46,889 --> 06:58:07,240
like another hour or two we'll see what happens at the end of this because once i get to wherever

1501
06:58:07,240 --> 06:58:12,409
i need to go here i'll try to complete some more of this quest line i don't know how much longer

1502
06:58:12,409 --> 06:58:33,369
it's gonna go it'll be a long time for all i know okay i did get some more water though i want to

06:58:33,369 --> 06:58:42,979
make sure it's cold i got an ice cube in here you're too tight no i'm good i'm good i'll be good for

1504
06:58:42,979 --> 06:58:51,669
like another half hour at least and then we'll be live again tomorrow we'll do it again tomorrow

1505
06:58:53,139 --> 06:58:56,819
then after tomorrow i'm gonna have to start to figure out what i want to do with this game

1506
06:59:00,040 --> 06:59:09,799
we'll see i i really don't know i'm still having a bunch of fun and i'm still finding new things

1507
06:59:09,799 --> 06:59:46,540
and finding more reasons to play oh that person riding a bug can i use my horse down here time

1508
06:59:46,540 --> 06:59:58,900
tomorrow probably on the same town for about four o'clock pacific four p.m pacific uh i could almost

1509
06:59:58,900 --> 07:00:03,380
level up again and i think i'm gonna just keep putting in intelligence try to get to that 52

1510
07:00:04,180 --> 07:00:18,840
i can't use the horse here i go up into the building or right this way there is so much

1511
07:00:18,840 --> 07:00:25,380
content there really is i don't it's like it's kind of overwhelming in a way it's just it's

1512
07:00:25,939 --> 07:00:51,799
i so much to do there's so much going on oh that hurts oh that hurts a lot

1513
07:00:52,759 --> 07:01:04,630
it's very overwhelming yeah it's every and every area is so different and fresh it is every area

1514
07:01:04,630 --> 07:01:12,310
just feels so and that's why it's almost hard to remember what's going on because everything

1515
07:01:12,310 --> 07:01:17,990
is so different there's so much going on that it's almost like wait this is a whole new zone

1516
07:01:18,869 --> 07:01:23,909
you almost you don't even give a shit what happened like two zones ago even though

1517
07:01:23,909 --> 07:01:31,060
that's important stuff going on there it's like that ant place that i just was there might be

1518
07:01:31,060 --> 07:01:36,569
something else there but it's like whoa look at a new pretty area i may i may as well have never

1519
07:01:36,569 --> 07:01:45,930
gone there to the ant place it just constantly a drip feeding new crazy places it's ridiculous

1520
07:01:47,639 --> 07:01:51,159
in a good way obviously not in a bad way right like in a very much a good way

1521
07:02:10,979 --> 07:02:27,689
germ of the ruins germ of the ruins i got him what's my take on asiago bagels um they're good

1522
07:02:28,250 --> 07:02:39,299
nothing wrong with them they taste good i'm gonna go over here i think i have enough to level up

1523
07:02:41,099 --> 07:02:57,990
i will do that this soft cap at 40 yep how do i compare this to bloodborne i kind of can't

1524
07:02:58,709 --> 07:03:09,299
it's uh it's actually becoming very difficult to do that for a few reasons the first most important

1525
07:03:09,299 --> 07:03:20,700
reason is bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive game that came out that's locked at 30 fps that was made in

1526
07:03:20,700 --> 07:03:30,060
2013 or 2014 or something right i mean that i consider that to be one of the best games i've

1527
07:03:30,060 --> 07:03:34,939
ever played in my whole life if not the best single player game i've ever played we all know

1528
07:03:34,939 --> 07:03:42,740
that we're all aware of that problem is this game comes out and i would say completely blows it

1529
07:03:42,740 --> 07:03:48,790
completely out of the water a thousand percent technically speaking it runs way better right

1530
07:03:49,430 --> 07:03:55,290
there's so much more to do there's so much more going on but it's like it's just it's kind of

1531
07:03:55,290 --> 07:04:02,099
unfair to say that because this game came out like look at eight years seven or eight years after

1532
07:04:02,099 --> 07:04:12,360
bloodborne did if bloodborne were to have if this was elden bloodborne right maybe i don't know

1533
07:04:12,360 --> 07:04:18,630
we'd be having a different question we're having a different conversation runs better yeah blood

1534
07:04:18,630 --> 07:04:25,430
borne was locked at 30 fps and all the time it would drop i remember that dropped down to like

1535
07:04:25,430 --> 07:04:31,770
25 frames a second a lot of time so it this game runs a thousand times better 2015 yeah well you

1536
07:04:31,770 --> 07:04:49,740
know what i mean it's been seven years since that game came out it's a shield how's this poison

1537
07:04:49,740 --> 07:05:07,799
build up if you attack with it oh is it alive damn what's the damage mitigation on this is

1538
07:05:07,799 --> 07:05:30,299
this thing's alive 100 physical guard boost yeah cool why does everything have to be alive in this

1539
07:05:30,299 --> 07:05:46,279
game it's kind of creepy isn't it yeah i i have already played through more areas in this game

1540
07:05:46,279 --> 07:05:54,939
than bloodborne times two already what is going on up here i feel like i've played through bloodborne

1541
07:05:54,939 --> 07:06:06,409
twice already and i'm not even like what halfway through the game why these guys electrified

1542
07:06:06,409 --> 07:06:29,799
it's killed each other okay well whatever i'll take it okay not even half yeah there's no way

1543
07:06:29,799 --> 07:06:36,330
they were not working on this game for the last like 10 years it's impossible i know that they

1544
07:06:36,330 --> 07:06:43,930
already had all these assets after making dark souls 3 and bloodborne and sekiro they had a

1545
07:06:43,930 --> 07:06:49,459
shitload of assets no fucking way this game took them three to four years to make it this game

1546
07:06:49,459 --> 07:06:54,380
has probably took them like seven or eight years to make it there's just too much to do there's too

1547
07:06:54,380 --> 07:07:01,400
much in the game there's too many things to see the game is too big you're gonna do the electric

1548
07:07:01,400 --> 07:07:14,310
explosion thing holy shit oh they have shields on their faces okay well let's change that then

1549
07:07:14,950 --> 07:08:03,020
okay can i get behind them whoa this game is worth 60 this game is worth probably

1550
07:08:03,020 --> 07:08:09,500
this game is worth probably 150 like this game the actual value of the video game is probably

1551
07:08:09,500 --> 07:08:23,740
worth like 125 dollars maybe even more this is like three video games like you're getting

1552
07:08:23,740 --> 07:08:29,270
all three lord of the rings movies in one game and you don't have to wait like three four years

1553
07:08:29,270 --> 07:08:34,169
between them like you know what they could have done and this is i'm gonna okay time to get from

1554
07:08:34,169 --> 07:08:40,840
software some some praise here they could have had like elden ring become like an episodic thing

1555
07:08:41,720 --> 07:08:47,880
right if it's like oh yeah elden ring part one we're seeing that a lot lately like oh it's like

1556
07:08:47,880 --> 07:08:53,659
the first part and the more will come later they could have done it in three parts they could have

1557
07:08:53,659 --> 07:08:58,779
done it in two parts it could have been like elden ring part one and elden ring part two

1558
07:08:58,779 --> 07:09:04,840
because there's that much content to do it episodic i know i say it weird

1559
07:09:05,959 --> 07:09:19,349
oh more stuff in the shop the whatever the dlc they do to this game is actual full-on

1560
07:09:20,580 --> 07:09:27,060
would be like the fourth or fifth dlc in dark souls 3 you're getting a game that has the amount

1561
07:09:27,060 --> 07:09:34,470
of content that would take probably five dlcs for dark souls 3 i don't even know what they're

1562
07:09:34,470 --> 07:09:45,750
gonna do for dlc it's already here it's already in the game i'm playing it right now final fantasy

1563
07:09:45,750 --> 07:09:51,770
7 remake that's a good point that's exactly kind of what i was talking about it's just

1564
07:09:53,430 --> 07:09:57,189
it's they they could have done that they could have actually just released it like in two or

1565
07:09:57,189 --> 07:10:09,189
three parts not saying the final fantasy 7 is a bad game to remake whatever it's just

1566
07:10:10,150 --> 07:10:11,349
i think they could have done that

1567
07:10:28,119 --> 07:10:32,040
final fantasy 7 remake is a bad game well i didn't say you did

1568
07:10:39,450 --> 07:10:57,380
i do it should i do it what do you think should i do it i'm doing it i thought those were statues

1569
07:10:57,380 --> 07:11:44,099
these are people they're not npcs either nox monk greaves all right so what is it what's in the

1570
07:11:44,099 --> 07:12:09,540
chest purple night maiden and swordstress puppets cool very cool fireplace this is literally the

1571
07:12:09,540 --> 07:12:19,000
area i just was looking at oh my goodness i can jump down be careful i didn't think i was gonna

1572
07:12:19,000 --> 07:12:35,639
be able to make that i i honest to god it's it's it's kind of bizarre to think that like what how

1573
07:12:35,639 --> 07:12:43,639
did they make sakiro if this was still going on i know they have two teams right who made sakiro

1574
07:12:43,639 --> 07:12:51,740
and who made this member it was like dark souls 2 wasn't uh oh i thought it was frozen i thought

1575
07:12:51,740 --> 07:13:11,959
i didn't know could come get me what the dark souls 2 team must have made sakiro that was so

1576
07:13:11,959 --> 07:13:19,659
much easier yeah because they had like an a team a b team and the b team would work on stuff while

1577
07:13:19,659 --> 07:13:23,830
the a team was working on something else all right i really hate to say a team and b team

1578
07:13:23,830 --> 07:13:27,909
but you know what i mean not like oh a like gray and better but like just two two teams

1579
07:13:28,549 --> 07:13:45,240
sakiro was still directed by miyazaki though yeah how does he have enough time to do any of this

1580
07:13:46,040 --> 07:13:51,610
like i'm just a streamer you know what i mean like i'll like get up in the morning

1581
07:13:51,610 --> 07:13:58,330
i don't know time is two o'clock i don't know what what am i doing today i got streaming

1582
07:13:59,049 --> 07:14:05,939
this guy's got like holy shit man the amount of work ethic and the amount of time and like

1583
07:14:06,900 --> 07:14:13,060
genius level iq to like have that much time and dedication and passion to do stuff like this it's

1584
07:14:13,060 --> 07:14:29,110
ridiculous in the morning you're still on boston time uh 2 p.m early bird yeah the early bird

1585
07:14:29,110 --> 07:14:39,979
special i don't know i'm at least happy that we get to experience just think about this this might

1586
07:14:39,979 --> 07:14:46,790
be a little sad for some of you but don't be sad it's literally probably one of the worst games

1587
07:14:46,790 --> 07:15:36,150
ever played i'm sad now only two hits gorsh gorsh gorsh okay so what i was gonna say

1588
07:15:39,290 --> 07:15:46,150
is this is gonna make people probably a little sad this these from software games have all come out

1589
07:15:47,349 --> 07:15:59,860
in this kind of like what like 10 like what 15 year span when did demon souls come out on ps3

1590
07:16:09,669 --> 07:16:20,869
2009 so it's been 12 13 years we are we are experiencing those of you that have played

1591
07:16:20,869 --> 07:16:26,009
these games a lot those of you that have played all of them which i have right or a lot of you

1592
07:16:26,009 --> 07:16:33,430
guys have to here's the generations that are coming after us because these games are so

1593
07:16:33,430 --> 07:16:39,590
interesting and they're so unique and they're so uniquely made and they're so weird like in

1594
07:16:39,590 --> 07:16:46,790
10 to 20 plus years people are going to be younger people right like in 20 years younger

1595
07:16:46,790 --> 07:16:52,950
people will be playing these as kind of this crazy wow well can you look at all look at how

1596
07:16:52,950 --> 07:16:57,909
ridiculous this was look at how much fun this was imagine like this this was coming out and

1597
07:16:57,909 --> 07:17:02,709
you get to play it right when it released that kind of shit right so many kids are going to be

1598
07:17:02,709 --> 07:17:06,950
playing this in 20 years and having those kind of conversations like the way that we have conversations

1599
07:17:06,950 --> 07:17:14,740
almost about like um even stuff like ocarina of time right or even before that but it's not even

1600
07:17:14,740 --> 07:17:31,180
the same though it's a boomer thought all right i hope i don't die that's worth it because we get

1601
07:17:31,180 --> 07:17:38,779
to play these as they come out and that's cool but being able to like play all the from software

1602
07:17:38,779 --> 07:17:45,259
games that at least since kind of the demon souls era of them making games it's going to be really

1603
07:17:45,340 --> 07:17:52,630
interesting because they're going to play them and what does it hate them or something like

1604
07:17:52,630 --> 07:17:56,889
they're going to die they're going to fall off a cliff or something and be like grandpa i don't

1605
07:17:56,889 --> 07:18:07,340
understand that's right you little fuck now you go back and get those souls like it's going to be

1606
07:18:07,340 --> 07:18:23,560
correct what if they what if this is like they think it's dumb get good grandson your grandson

1607

07:25:21,939 --> 07:25:48,009
not a big deal at all ah this way right i hear some something growling oh yeah i've guys i've

1625
07:25:48,009 --> 07:25:52,490
been streaming and doing youtube for over 10 years but you know that half my material is just

1626
07:25:52,490 --> 07:25:59,450
calling back to other things that i've done over the last 11 years we've reached that stage where

1627
07:25:59,450 --> 07:26:03,290
i can do a widget it's just re-reference these things that's like the whole thing now

1628
07:26:04,169 --> 07:26:17,209
i'm gonna get attacked by something there's a whole nother area down there

1631
07:27:04,549 --> 07:27:19,560

1632
07:27:19,560 --> 07:28:15,029
actually is that what's that i'm gonna go in there you're close okay all right don't fight

1633
07:28:15,029 --> 07:28:23,560

1634
07:28:23,560 --> 07:28:34,659

1635
07:28:35,380 --> 07:28:46,470
this ring must be so old the elden ring and yeah probably a few thousand years old

1636
07:28:47,110 --> 07:29:07,110

1637
07:29:07,750 --> 07:29:22,250
i don't know scary like i am like irrationally afraid of this or scary like this thing is

1638
07:29:22,250 --> 07:29:31,750
terrifying and can like hurt people because i guess probably a centipede or something

1639
07:29:32,759 --> 07:29:38,360
or like a uh like a yellow jacket like hornet because hornets are just mean they're just

1640
07:29:38,360 --> 07:30:29,259
actually mean angry little shitheads really hey this wasn't your fight those guys suck

1787
08:12:52,729 --> 08:12:59,689
one in your guide i don't have i have i have not been using a guide ever the only time i used it

1788
08:12:59,689 --> 08:13:05,770
was when i opened it because it looked like this was going to get confusing this quest i've played

1789
08:13:05,770 --> 08:13:09,849
50 hours of this game without a guide we've been you and i have been talking and trying to figure

1790
08:13:09,849 --> 08:13:41,779
out what the fuck man where do i go i haven't even used it nobody said dude it's really cute

1791
08:13:41,779 --> 08:13:46,659
even you've been pretending what like you don't know where to go but we can see the reflection

1792
08:13:46,659 --> 08:13:54,810
of the guide on your forehead i swear to god i'm i want to experience the game

1793
08:13:56,810 --> 08:14:01,930
let me ask you this do you really think i'm using a guide if i didn't know what a sacred tier did

1794
08:14:01,930 --> 08:14:08,330
until literally yesterday do you think i'm using a guide if i didn't have the physique flask until

1795
08:14:08,330 --> 08:14:12,490
40 hours into the game do you think of what i'm just i don't what do you think what are

1796
08:14:12,490 --> 08:14:26,729
you talking about i'm dead all right i got the items over here i didn't know that sacred tears

1797
08:14:26,729 --> 08:14:37,700
were in churches until like seven game like 12 game hours ago you're getting a tactical advantage

1798
08:14:37,700 --> 08:14:44,500
all right so just tank it and run i got the items over there we're gonna go get the items over here

1799
08:14:48,340 --> 08:15:04,979
an item run what don't you think doesn't the rock grease just sound like a big fat guy is like

1800
08:15:04,979 --> 08:15:14,069
cooking food for you what's that rock grease it's healthy it's fine rock grease to me sounds like

1801
08:15:14,069 --> 08:15:19,209
they didn't like change the fryer later oil and i have something about it like i don't care

1802
08:15:21,319 --> 08:15:36,619
like that's kind of like that's weirdly appetizing to me i don't know why is that strange i don't know

1803
08:15:36,619 --> 08:15:40,220
like something about like oh oh like grease i don't know i don't know something about it maybe

1804
08:15:40,220 --> 08:15:50,119
i think that sounds good somehow in a cartoon pretend way you know what i mean i was just

1805
08:15:50,119 --> 08:15:57,139
just seeing if there was any items over there everyone relax you sound delirious just get to

1806
08:15:57,139 --> 08:16:03,130
the ball i'm i'm just telling you it's a cartoon world i'm talking about i'm not going to go put

1807
08:16:03,130 --> 08:16:10,340
like rot grease on my hot dog i'm not going to put rot grease on like my cheeseburger later i'm

1808
08:16:10,340 --> 08:16:15,540
just saying like uh grease like rot grease just sounds like something like a big fat cartoon

1809
08:16:15,540 --> 08:16:21,220
character would put on his hot dog and in that world in that context i'd be like it's that's

1810
08:16:21,220 --> 08:16:34,330
not bad wait what the fuck just happened what did i just step on i just drained the lake of rot

1811
08:16:34,889 --> 08:16:55,450

1812
08:16:55,450 --> 08:17:08,740

1853
08:29:42,709 --> 08:29:49,560

1854
08:29:54,330 --> 08:30:10,889
all right that's it i'm gonna stop it right here i'm gonna sit at the fire i'll see you guys

1855
08:30:10,889 --> 08:30:16,220
tomorrow i'm gonna go eat some food i'm gonna rest my voice for a little bit because it's

1856
08:30:16,220 --> 08:30:33,880
kind of getting a little junky i will see you guys tomorrow let me put on the credits

1857
08:30:34,680 --> 08:30:52,279
we're at 4 pm the pt so how i haven't really done i didn't do any of the main kind of quest

1858
08:30:52,279 --> 08:31:01,080
line today did i just kind of running around doing this stuff i really like this area this

1859
08:31:01,080 --> 08:31:10,119
is a really cool spot how much more realistically percentage wise like where am i percentage wise in

1860
08:31:10,119 --> 08:31:28,099
the game realistically 30 to 40 40 maybe 50 that's ridiculous you're legit like 50

1861
08:31:28,979 --> 08:31:42,740
that's crazy so this really is like 100 plus this is a 100 plus hour game on a first playthrough

1862
08:31:42,740 --> 08:31:54,389
without seeing everything that's ridiculous the game took me about 80 hours to fully explore it

1863
08:31:55,029 --> 08:32:10,200
i believe i'm like 48 49 hours in that's still in the 30 to 40 plus hours are you liking the

1864
08:32:10,200 --> 08:32:20,229
game yeah i mean i think it's it's ridiculous it's really easy to get overwhelmed but i think what

1865
08:32:20,229 --> 08:32:25,349
i have to start doing is i didn't do this yesterday and this is where we're gonna i did it today is

1866
08:32:26,310 --> 08:32:32,840
i picked four or five things that i wanted to go do specific areas i wanted to go look at

1867
08:32:34,259 --> 08:32:38,979
and just did those and if something led to another thing if that thing led to another thing i did

1868
08:32:38,979 --> 08:32:45,909
that too uh yesterday i kind of just was wandering around i got like lost and i didn't really have

1869
08:32:45,909 --> 08:32:51,209
any direction or anything but i uh i definitely like the idea of picking a few places to go

1870
08:32:51,849 --> 08:33:05,139
but yeah thanks for watching guys see you tomorrow four o'clock pacific same thing elden ring after

1871
08:33:05,139 --> 08:33:10,020
tomorrow's stream we're gonna have to evaluate what i want to do with this game i'm gonna have

1872
08:33:10,020 --> 08:33:18,330
to evaluate what the plan is because i don't want to just stream elden ring only so the stuff i'd

1873
08:33:18,330 --> 08:33:26,970
like to do we'll find out after tomorrow are you gonna drop it after the stream tomorrow

1874
08:33:27,849 --> 08:33:41,930
i don't know i don't think so i may um maybe we sprinkle in some mario golf go back to it

1875
08:33:42,650 --> 08:33:45,770
problem with coming back to it and this is the problem with all souls games

1876
08:33:46,810 --> 08:33:51,720
my fear of not playing this game for more than two or three days

1877
08:33:53,319 --> 08:34:00,250
coming back to this game a week or two later you just you're gonna get your ass kicked and it's

1878
08:34:00,250 --> 08:34:04,330
gonna be hard to get back into the swing of things to remember where anything was

1879
08:34:05,290 --> 08:34:11,369
to have the timings down it's it's rough to come back to a from software game

1880
08:34:11,930 --> 08:34:20,169
if you don't play it for like a few weeks so if i were to stop playing it every day or every stream

1881
08:34:20,970 --> 08:34:28,119
they would it would have to be a case of all right we're gonna do mario golf and then like

1882
08:34:28,119 --> 08:34:33,159
like the next day we're gonna play elden ring two days in a row right they're gonna be a lot of

1883
08:34:33,240 --> 08:34:41,720
streams i think for me to continue to want to play this but we'll see i mean i might just keep

1884
08:34:41,720 --> 08:34:58,549
going as of tomorrow as well we'll see i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll pick up right here

1885
08:34:59,270 --> 08:35:31,830
take care of yourselves see you guys soon have a good one really important before i go

1886
08:35:32,630 --> 08:35:46,180
did the frame drop stop and if they did when they kept going the whole way even up until like right

1887
08:35:46,180 --> 08:35:53,450
now did they actually get better or has it still been happening maybe like an hour ago

1888
08:36:00,950 --> 08:36:06,310
it weren't as bad as they were a few minutes ago yeah so this is definitely not an internet

1889
08:36:06,310 --> 08:36:19,380
problem for me yet like one o'clock in the morning no way yeah now i confirmed it a few times anyways

1890
08:36:21,080 --> 08:36:25,080
hopefully that whatever routing issue or server issue that's happening with twitch

1891
08:36:25,080 --> 08:36:31,500
i really hope that gets resolved because that would suck all right good night see you tomorrow
