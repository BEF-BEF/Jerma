1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:12,490
No, I'm not back yet. I'm not back yet. I want to I want to refill my drink. I'm not quite back yet.

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:48,130
Not quite. Give me a sec. Hold on. I'm not quite back yet. I need to refill my drink.

3
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:56,490
I do have something really cool though. I think I've showed this already, didn't I? I probably did. It's cool though.

4
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:09,650
All right, actually, you know, I'll be all right. I'll be I'll take a break in a little bit. Let's just get to it.

5
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:24,650
Okay. Hello. How are you? There's that. There's that. And of course here am I.

6
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm back. Welcome everybody to season two of multiverses. It's been a while since we played this.

7
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,359
Thank you Warner Brothers for sponsoring the stream.

8
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:47,980
This is gonna be a couple of hours of sponsored content. By the way, just in case you didn't know. What's it available on?

9
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:55,870
Do we know? PlayStation, Xbox, PC, cross-platform. They just did a huge, huge

10
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:01,200
internet change and it's apparently really cool and it's apparently good.

11
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,530
There's some new characters we haven't played with which I need to do that first.

12
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:18,840
But yeah, season two, I believe just started right now. You'll see Marvin Martian at some point soon here. Show us your legs.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,120
They exist. Here, you wanna, you wanna see what, okay, fine.

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:38,229
You wanna see what kind of, you wanna see what kind of pants I'm wearing? Here, you wanna see? Yeah, there it is.

15
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:50,569
There's, there are my pants. There, I ripped the leg. It's fine. These things were already ripped.

16
00:02:50,569 --> 00:03:01,659
Did you, could you hear the tearing? Could you, did it come through?

17
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:10,509
Let's get to it everybody. Okay, I actually need to practice first.

18
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:17,759
But yeah, thanks again to Warner Brothers. Warner Brothers has been incredibly awesome to this channel. Let's see who's here.

19
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:27,780
I know there's another Gremlins character, which is pretty sick. So let's see who we got. They've added, of course,

20
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,939
there's Rick from Rick and Morty. There's Black Adam. There's

21
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:51,180
Stripe. Let me see Black Adam. Let's see what you do. Okay, that's cool. Looks, looks pretty good.

22
00:03:51,659 --> 00:04:02,990
All right, so what about the specials? Let me read about this because that's pretty cool. Whoa, a lot of Bugs Bunny stuff.

23
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:15,370
Yeah, I'm a little rusty, but let me go to the move list. Okay, so let's see. That's a, okay.

24
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,009
Black Adam releases a beam of lightning to, this is just neutral, why?

25
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,949
Damaging them repeatedly and applying shock before tossing them either up or down.

26
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,629
Can I choose which way they go? When the lightning hits a target it searches for nearby

27
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,339
targets, jumping to them to repeat the move in a chain of electric attacks. You can charge it.

28
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:42,350
All right. Dash forward and is chased moments later by a bolt projectile.

29
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:50,420
This bolt will reflect off the force field generated by Black Adam's grounded down special. Okay, let's see.

30
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:56,230
Let's see what that looks like. So what's the down special? That stays there.

31
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:10,759
It bounces off that. So what does that do? Black Adam briefly gains the ability to fly in any direction. That's awesome.

32
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:19,689
Generates an electromagnetic force that it blocks enemy. That's actually insane. It blocks all projectiles.

33
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:24,480
My voice did that. It was a weird thing that just happened, but trust me, I actually think it's interesting.

34
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:39,699
All right. So what about this stuff? Holy shit. Seems actually pretty good. Lot of cooldowns though, it seems.

35
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:57,509
How long can you fly for? A pretty long time. I'll give it a try. Okay, so what about who's next?

36
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:02,069
There's also Stripe, which is, that's definitely, I'm gonna play Stripe for sure.

37
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,899
Gremlins.

38
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:12,720
Already like it. Already like the moves.

39
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
It's, you know, it's kind of funny.

40
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:23,779
I never thought in my entire life that they would bring gremlins back, but they did. All right, that's a pretty good combo. What about down?

41
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,939
Sawz?

42
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:39,149
All right, let's take a look at the moves. Stripe fires his gun at close range. All right, there's a gun.

43
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:48,740
I believe that means that they're targeted. Okay. He will shoot at them. Okay, if Stripe has targeted an enemy,

44
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,420
he will shoot at them instead, regardless of distance. That just seems like a better version of

45
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,490
Velma. Doesn't Velma put a target?

46
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:04,899
All right, Stripe charges a push with his skateboard and shoots across the area. He also can combo into a backflip.

47
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,319
Oh my god, that's fast. Okay.

48
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:24,709
That's terrifying. I like this character. Oh, I like this character a lot.

49
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,879
Okay, cool. What else we got?

50
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:35,060
I could just kind of learn as I go. Stripe dashes upward at his target.

51
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:43,379
If he hits any projectile while leaping, he will destroy it. Stripe pulls out a bundle of dynamite that detonates after a duration. Press input

52
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,379
again to detonate it immediately.

53
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:57,740
Detonating ignites and hits enemies outward. Stripe also receives damage. What? So I get her too? Oh, okay.

54
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,459
All right, I'm taking Stripe into ranked. Show Marvin? I don't know if Marvin's available. I don't think he's out yet.

55
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:27,699
There's no- I have to- we have to look at Rick for a second at least. Just for a second. Actually kind of cracked.

56
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:43,799
Actually kind of cracked. I think I might be playing Rick Sanchez.

57
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:53,529
That was funny. I'm sorry it was. That was actually pretty funny. That was funny. Yeah, it was.

58
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:03,129
All right, let's give it a try. I'm in- I'm in fucking wood league, so it really doesn't matter. Let's look at the battle pass.

59
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:12,009
Astronaut velvet. Pretty cool. Utility belt Batman. What else is here? What's the very last thing?

60
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,490
Shield and bubbles.

61
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:31,220
I love the ring out effect stuff. What is this? What's this? Taz taunt. Taz hungry. What's this?

62
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,929
Bug's bunny taunt. All right, I'm ready. I think I'm- I think I'm warmed up.

63
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,649
Gotta take a real series, huh?

64
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,100
I think I'm ready. Let's go- let's go play wood league. I'm ready. All right, let's get out of here.

65
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:53,269
How do I get out of here? Oh, there we go. All right, you guys pumped up for season two of multiverses. Let's go!

66
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,490
Top 10 most pumped up moments.

67
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,519
There's- they added a bunch of weird shit too. This is cool.

68
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,669
Arcade classic? Yeah, like look, there's like weird like silly mode. We definitely have to play silly mode.

69
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,509
Let me get back into- should I do ranked? This is gonna be so embarrassing.

70
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,879
All right, I'm gonna do ranked one-on-one and it's gonna be a desa-

71
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:31,639
Should I warm up first? No, we're going right in with stripe. Let's go. I'm ready.

72
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:52,759
I think I got- I- it's like riding a bike. Yeah, silly mode activated. I wonder what it is. Where's the level-

73
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,879
Any perks?

74
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,570
Oh, this is gonna be a disaster. Um, all right. Well, let's see what happens. Uh, my rank- rank-

75
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,629
Excuse me, didn't even show this bad boy off. That's a multiverses controller.

76
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:21,659
I didn't think I was gonna get a multiverses control. All right, let me actually be real here. Let me try.

77
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,519
It's all about the gun. It's all about the dynamite.

78
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:40,379
Here we go.

79
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:45,080
Ooh!

80
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,919
My audio is all messed up.

81
00:11:48,919 --> 00:12:05,029
Ah!

82
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:24,659
Oh, that move is gonna be so cool if you can hit it. Ooh, I can throw blades too. That's cool.

83
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:37,240
I just hurt myself.

84
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,440
Oh!

85
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
How am I still on the stage? That's crazy.

86
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:35,460
Oh, not good. It's all right. I love the screams. Come on.

87
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
All right. Come on. Come on. I got four minutes. I got four minutes.

88
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:20,549
Don't do it. No!

89
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:25,960
It's all right. It's a warm-up. It's a warm-up. It's the first match I played in like three weeks.

90
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,190
That was- I did pretty good. That wasn't bad. That's the first match I've had in like three weeks.

91
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:40,440
Let's go again.

92
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,779
You don't have any perks. You lost to an Xbox player? So what?

93
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,899
What do you- should I- who should I play with? I'm gonna stick with Stripe.

94
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,419
No, no. We change it up.

95
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:57,919
Bugs.

96
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:15,799
I got perks on Bugs. Level 11. I was pretty good with uh- what's the name there? Um,

97
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,399
Gizmo.

98
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:25,110
Yeah, go ahead. Bet. Hey, the rust is gonna shake off here and I'm gonna do just fine.

99
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,850
Uh-oh, he's bringing out the main.

100
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:45,480
I got one minute. I don't want to- this is a nice controller. I don't want to mess it up.

101
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,039
All right, let's go. Don't be messing around.

102
00:15:49,080 --> 00:16:09,850
Check this out. What the hell is going on?

103
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:29,429
Shit. All right, bring it back. Let's go.

104
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:18,359
Oh shit.

105
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:30,230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. I got plenty of time.

106
00:17:46,700 --> 00:18:01,960
Don't do anything stupid. I got the advantage here. There it is. All right. We're good. We're good. We're getting it back.

107
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:21,190
This is ranked, man. I gotta get out of Wood League. I mean, we gotta go for the whole thing, right? This is it.

108
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,099
Do I stick with Bugs or should I go- no, I gotta stick with what I know, right?

109
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:48,809
Hmm, land the first knock-up, knockback. All right, cool. I'm gonna stick with Bugs. It's like riding a bike. I remember all the moves.

110
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:59,480
Go with Rick? I don't know anything about Rick. I would have to go with not in ranked. I'm just gonna joke around with it.

111
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,309
That's why you have to practice.

112
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,450
Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

113
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,099
All right, let's see if I can pull this out. Let me get into my zone here. All right, let's go.

114
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,839
I feel like my eyes are bugging out of my head. All right, just let's do it.

115
00:19:23,079 --> 00:20:24,039
It's my odd one. All right, this is the Rick Sanchez level. Gotta keep the pressure up. Shit. Oh,

116
00:20:44,740 --> 00:21:01,640
Ooh, oh, it's gonna come. Bad. Come on. Come on. Sweaty hands.

117
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,930
What was that? That was a dog toy. You have to go off the line.

118
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,970
I could never make that sound ever again if you- if you told me to, right?

119
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,569
I gotta turn the camera off for that. I don't- the camera's not linked up to anything. Good game. Good game.

120
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:17,029
What did that even sound like?

121
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:33,859
Multiverses is on the Xbox,

122
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
PlayStation, and PC with complete cross-platform.

123
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:44,549
By the way, season two is out now and it's pretty damn fun.

124
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,579
All right, I'm gonna do-

125
00:22:54,819 --> 00:22:59,299
Gizmo was fun. Let me see if I can remember how to play Gizmo. I'm not doing ranked. We're not- we're just gonna play normal.

126
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:11,259
I don't think I'm ever coming out of wood league. Let's do normal and

127
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,190
let's just maybe- no, no, not silly mode yet. Not silly mode.

128
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,720
Let me try stripe again.

129
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,539
Why did he squeak? I do- I-

130
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:38,329
I don't know. I don't- I couldn't make that sound ever again. I'm telling you, even if you- it doesn't matter what would happen here.

131
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,319
So I'm trying to think of the combos to do with stripe. It seems to be you want to get the target,

132
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:07,940
bop, bop, bop, juggle, and then do an up smash. Okay, let's go for it.

133
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,980
What the heck?

134
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,059
Was that- what happened?

135
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,380
Stripe's fun.

136
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
Do you want to go again or

137
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:51,880
start over?

138
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,049
Nah, I'm good. Okay. Well, thanks for playing.

139
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,490
I guess that was- we- we got it. I'll take the win, whatever.

140
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:20,150
Oh, do I have any points? No, it's okay.

141
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,849
I'm never doubting ever again.

142
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:36,329
Thanks for the refund. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, sometimes it doesn't count, right?

143
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,099
Is the chatbot working, by the way? Let me make sure it is.

144
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,140
Should be- I believe so. Okay, it should be popping up.

145
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:05,930
All right, this is versus a high level shaggy, so I gotta be- I gotta be ready for this. I'm trying to learn stripe.

146
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,769
I'm a gremlins franchise only player.

147
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:37,369
Oops.

148
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:39,369
Dang, when I run out of booms!

149
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:53,819
Oh! How did that block?

150
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:29,609
No! Don't! I got perfect.

151
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:40,819
Bro, he got owned. Yeah, this is a shaggy that knows what he's doing.

152
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:51,210
I got a better idea. Pulling out the LeBron.

153
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:03,980
Do I have this? Oh, I don't have that. Oh.

154
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:17,500
Oh, no, why? I'm ready.

155
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:35,960
Oh, let me pull this one out.

156
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:44,680
Yeah, there is- there's a new battle pass. Is that part- is that part of a battle pass? All right.

157
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,680
Let's see if I can pull this out.

158
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,099
I lost the ball already.

159
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,069
Oh, man, this is bad. It ain't over yet.

160
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,799
This guy's a good player. I don't- this guy's- this guy's not in wood league, okay?

161
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:10,009
It ain't over. It ain't over. It ain't over.

162
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,119
Oh, I'm just getting combo'd.

163
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,839
Oh, he's mad.

164
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,119
So am I.

165
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,119
Let's go, man.

166
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:47,690
I just fucking freaked you out for no reason. No, I want that- I need that ball. Fucking really- I'm in wood league!

167
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,750
Your eyes popped out of your head.

168
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:42,140
Dude, you fell off. Just fine. Does he really- he isn't- no, no, no.

169
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,259
I don't want to play ranked because I don't want to go up against people that can beat me bad.

170
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,230
I gotta stick with one character and play.

171
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:11,049
We're gonna stay on Stripe. We're not moving off Stripe for at least 25 minutes. Okay.

172
00:32:12,009 --> 00:33:27,339
What's going on?

173
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,190
Oi!

174
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,490
Oi!

175
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,170
Stop! Don't taunt! Don't taunt! That makes me angry!

176
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:17,619
Yeah, I mean, this is a spider in the room. A huge spider just went down. You can't revoke my gamer license.

177
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,900
That's not fair.

178
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:26,820
I gotta get like a few warm-up games in and I- well, I am so red and it's because they can't- hold on.

179
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,619
I'm not this red, I swear.

180
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:36,820
Look at how red the room is! Have I emanating heat from my body?

181
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:45,610
I'm not red. My room is red. I'm not heating up the room, right?

182
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,230
All right. Okay, it's against level 8 Morty. Everything's gonna be fine.

183
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,849
Shit.

184
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,329
I'm starting to get it. We'll be good.

185
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:10,679
You should stand up. No, I'll fall down. I'll be good. We just gotta warm up a little. I'll get a few wins.

186
00:35:11,000 --> 00:36:45,030
Was that a grenade? So many places to fall down. Damn it! Oh my god, we're on a boat!

187
00:37:14,809 --> 00:38:57,530
Yeah!

188
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:11,019
Got it. Ah, that felt good. That felt good. That felt good.

189
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:19,530
Over Dean?

190
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,530
Yeah!

191
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:34,460
Somebody said I move around too much. I know. I do. Again, season 2 is out. It's on everything.

192
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:44,889
PC, Xbox, PlayStation. You can play this complete cross-play. It's all there. Season pass is available right now.

193
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:52,949
I like Stripe. That's gonna do better.

194
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:07,059
This was the Rick who gamed on you, is it? I gotta get my revenge. This is the Rick who's dude who absolutely just dunked on me.

195
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:59,989
Oh, it worked out!

196
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:09,190
Oh, what happened, Rick?

197
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:19,699
That's not even fair! You did a...

198
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:35,659
Whatever. I mean, it's just well known that Rick is a complete hard counter to Stripe. We all know that.

199
00:42:51,059 --> 00:43:10,969
Oh, what'd I get? Oh, wait a minute. Oh, I got the astronaut Belma. Cool. I'm buying my lip too much.

200
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:24,570
Profile? 50 coins? I feel like I would like Batman a lot, but I just never get him any time.

201
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:33,179
At all. Okay, this is up next. Maybe I should change some stuff up here.

202
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:47,829
This is not... Okay. Do you remember when I played last time and I had like an 80% win rate? I've played like five games.

203
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:57,900
That's like only today. That's today. What do I got? That's cute.

204
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:21,909
Somebody said, can you please do the Stripe impression? Yeah, sure.

205
00:44:30,809 --> 00:45:00,309
That'll be a thousand dollars, please. I'm kidding. Don't do that. That's not worst impression. That was pretty close.

206
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:38,900
Both had the same idea. Both brilliant players.

207
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:51,579
All right, I'm getting too fancy. Don't get too fancy. Just play. I'll just play. Oh, I got it off first. That's horseshit.

208
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,139
Oh, Snipe. Stripe is fun.

209
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:19,639
You're sim...

210
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:25,909
Why are you squirming around? Whenever I play a game like this, my whole body has to move back and forth.

211
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:27,989
I just have to be... I'm inside the game.

212
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,909
Do you guys remember back in the day when they talked about those, oh,

213
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:38,170
like, oh, you can wear this thing that when you get hit, you get hit. They like toyed with that idea.

214
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,889
Like it was like a dun dun dun dun dun dun dun, or something, right?

215
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:51,130
I feel like I have one of those on. Let's go back to Bugs for a little bit.

216
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,010
I do want to mess around with Black Adam, though. Seems like his move set's pretty fun.

217
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:05,159
Start time. Maybe Velma.

218
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:13,900
Maybe, yeah.

219
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
I played Stripe for 25 minutes.

220
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:21,699
All right, no more like high stress. I feel like I've warmed up. I feel like I'm good to go.

221
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:38,789
Don't let him do that.

222
00:48:38,789 --> 00:49:08,300
What's happening? Keep letting him do it.

223
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:49,980
Careful. Oh, I thought I could just drain him. All right. Okay. All right.

224
00:50:24,820 --> 00:51:00,340
Oh, sandwich versus pie. Don't let him do that!

225
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,670
What?

226
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:19,619
I'm not playing it up. I genuinely move around. I don't even know what I'm doing. Am I like moving too much?

227
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:31,719
That was a good fight. That was very good. Stop pretending. I'm not, I'm not pretending.

228
00:51:35,639 --> 00:52:10,409
Oh, what's this? Oh, a shaggy ring out. I'm curious about what that is. Oh, that's cool. Also cool.

229
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:33,219
Oh, that's cool, too. Didn't I? What did I get? I'll do this one. This one looks good. All right, one more.

230
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,510
One more. Wait, what's this? I don't want to activate that yet. Okay, one more

231
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:50,280
of these will do a little bit of silly mode. You're doing video game commercial acting.

232
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,960
You mean when they're like this and they're like, oh,

233
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:19,500
and they're pressing buttons really hard. It really, ah, whatever. Whatever. It's fine. You need something blowing in your hair, too.

234
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:32,969
Yeah, make it some uh, fuel in me. This level is really hard. I think there's some new maps too, right?

235
00:53:40,179 --> 00:54:12,179
All right. Come on, let me play.

236
00:54:35,380 --> 00:55:29,780
Oh, the snipe at the end. Oops, it's on fire.

237
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:51,260
snipe

238
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,969
See, I just had to play a few games. Everybody said, oh my god,

239
00:55:57,449 --> 00:56:02,650
this dude is awful. I can't believe this guy thinks he can play this game. What are you? This is a joke.

240
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:05,289
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,010
He's gonna, you gotta warm up a little bit.

242
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,460
I'd be careful where you put your uh, channel points at this point, guys.

243
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:37,739
Uh, you're too confident now. That's it. That's good.

244
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:53,190
Gotta have a little bit of confidence. Dude, you're still in plastic league. That's all right. I'm still, I'm still going somewhere. You go from

245
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:59,260
water to wood to plastic to steel to bronze.

246
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:03,909
I got a long way to go, but what did I just do?

247
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,340
Come on, pick character.

248
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:22,440
Skipping cardboard.

249
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:30,300
Dude, I guarantee you if I grinded rank, I would just be at bronze two.

250
00:57:31,219 --> 00:57:38,099
I would, I would always win one, lose two, win two, lose two, win one, lose three, win three, lose four.

251
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:45,030
I would never climb. I can never get something going where I win like 10 times in a row.

252
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,739
I would always be bronze two or bronze one.

253
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:02,230
I get in my own head way too much in competitive games because I start doing

254
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,030
well and then I get a little bit too comfortable and relax a little bit and then no, no, no, I lose two in a row.

255
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,210
Then I get angry

256
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:15,369
and then try as hard as I can for the next two, win both of those, get confident and comfortable and relax a little, lose two in a row.

257
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:25,019
Are you, are you not fighting me?

258
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:27,780
Okay, are you, are we playing?

259
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,019
All right. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, we're playing. We're, we are playing.

260
00:58:30,659 --> 00:59:15,300
Risky.

261
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:24,980
Oh, got my static. Did you actually get that off? How did I not hit you?

262
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:54,329
Let's do it. All right. Yeah, look, you're gonna, you gotta learn how to play. I have to learn how to play.

263
00:59:55,719 --> 01:00:03,900
I'm gonna play, I'll play Black Adam.

264
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:11,260
You don't know, who knows? You know, sometimes they have bad games. Sometimes you're trying to learn a character. Well, hey, hey,

265
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:26,710
relax. Okay. Oh, you're looking for a mirror.

266
01:00:28,309 --> 01:01:00,280
I have no idea how to play Black Adam, but we'll try. Don't get cocky. I'm not gonna. Somebody just wrote, am I banned?

267
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:14,940
Testing to see if you're banned in the chat. Okay, here we go. See, we're good.

268
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:33,179
Black Adam is disgusting.

269
01:01:33,260 --> 01:02:25,079
That's my bubble. Get out of it. We were just like two dogs playing. Just like, we're gonna play, we're running around having so much fun.

270
01:02:25,400 --> 01:03:02,710
Stop. Okay, let's go again. Oh, we just died. Okay. That was fun. That was fun.

271
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:07,349
It's a fun game. It's a fun game. People are gonna play the fun game. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry.

272
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:19,579
I, I, I had warmed up. Do silly mode.

273
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:33,219
How about one more with Stripe and then we'll do silly mode. Does Stripe have an announcer pack?

274
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,840
Because I have to have it, if that's the case.

275
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:48,420
What's this? That's, oh, that's good.

276
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:57,269
Anytime for three seconds after knocking back an enemy with a projectile. That's pretty good.

277
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,480
Uh, this is a level 13.

278
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:24,150
Uh, Garnet, so we're gonna be prepared. I don't really know Garnet's, but I forget Garnet's moves. And we've got, um,

279
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:26,230
home field advantage here.

280
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:36,579
This is, uh, it's gonna be hard.

281
01:04:36,579 --> 01:05:16,650
All right, that was an extreme move. I will agree. I'm on a ride right now. This is the multi versus carnival ride.

282
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:27,429
All right, focus.

283
01:05:27,429 --> 01:05:55,909
Don't do that. No, no, no, no, no.

284
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:29,479
That was such a good match too. Dude, you're a freak. Okay. I gotta, I gotta bring out something.

285
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:40,949
Good.

286
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:35,899
What's wrong with him? I'm gaming, man. Yeah, we'll do silly mode after this. All right, level 19 Batman. I gotta be prepared.

287
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:50,279
You guys having fun? All right, should I do, we'll do silly.

288
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,079
All right, silly Q. Do we have to pick rules or what is, uh, what is silly mode?

289
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:04,220
There's also a, I think, a versus,

290
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:16,090
like an arcade mode versus boss or something. I want to see what that is too. I, I, I don't know why I left.

291
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:34,729
Okay, so it's a 2v2 silly mode. Yeah, I'll do some 2v2s now. Refund the point.

292
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:52,140
Uh, was there, did it go through? I did. Okay, good. What is this?

293
01:10:54,569 --> 01:11:11,300
Okay, I'm not gonna almost fall off the stage and squeak. I'm gonna be relaxed and we're gonna play. Okay, four ring outs.

294
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,310
What? Okay, so we just have big heads.

295
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:29,500
Why did Morty already lose? I don't think Morty's here.

296
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:45,189
This is truly silly.

297
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:53,960
Last box is shrinking.

298
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,159
Well, we didn't, I don't want to just end silly mode right now. Oh, man.

299
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:24,140
Okay, that, this is a literal 2v1. That Taz was actually holding pretty well.

300
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:37,880
Uh, yeah, I don't think we continue this. I think we go do it again. Some gold, nice.

301
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:51,989
Forget how to play with gizmo, but it's silly mode, so it's okay.

302
01:12:52,789 --> 01:13:12,020
Yeah, well, no, we don't, don't run bets on, uh, on silly mode. Do a gizmo impression.

303
01:13:12,579 --> 01:13:29,909
No, I did a stripe impression. Everybody told me it was embarrassing. So I, why would I do another one? Do it now.

304
01:13:40,539 --> 01:13:47,079
All right, level 19, but it doesn't matter. It's silly mode. I remember gizmo being really fun.

305
01:14:13,029 --> 01:14:21,020
Oh, yeah, then you shoot the popcorn. I remember. Okay. Isn't there also a little car too? Yep, there is.

306
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:33,880
I loved gizmo. Dude, I'm giving my teammate a bunch of, a bunch of juice or whatever that was.

307
01:14:34,439 --> 01:15:00,420
How do I shoot the bow and arrow? I forget. Is it down?

308
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:26,039
Up? Or how do I do, how to shoot the bow and arrow? Come here, take some of this juice. Right bumper?

309
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:29,590
Oh, that's what it is. Right. Okay. I was like, where the hell is it?

310
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:50,579
Was this TV?

311
01:15:50,579 --> 01:16:19,659
Oh my goodness. Where was I going? It's too silly. There it is. All right, we brought it back. Brought it back.

312
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:32,779
Take this juice. There it is. Give me a hand here. Give me a hand here. Who am I talking to?

313
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:41,220
We got it.

314
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:46,420
All right, give me a hand here. Juice over here, man. Like I'm, you know, nobody can hear me besides you guys.

315
01:16:53,779 --> 01:17:04,899
Alting.

316
01:17:04,899 --> 01:17:12,220
So what's, let me see the other mode. See this arcade classic?

317
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:18,260
Play a series of enemies that will take you on a journey across the multiverse. Do you have what it takes to make it to the end?

318
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,479
Three stages, unlimited tries. Let's, let's do medium.

319
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,710
What is this? It's arcade?

320
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:39,020
I wonder. So it's an adventure mode?

321
01:18:01,699 --> 01:18:12,010
Okay, so let's see what this is. I'm interested. Stage one of five.

322
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,279
Sorry, kid. I know you got this game for Christmas, but

323
01:18:35,100 --> 01:19:24,949
try to rank up here.

324
01:19:24,949 --> 01:19:48,380
I know I'm doing the I'm trying really hard face, but I kind of am. Oh, that was it. There it is.

325
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:59,819
By the way, the game's also free to play. Get it right now. Season two has officially launched Xbox, PC, PlayStation.

326
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,340
Can I hear it please?

327
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:15,479
So it was just another round?

328
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:34,569
I'm curious what happens at the end of this. Do you get experience? I will say

329
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:42,970
Let's be completely real. I have never played an online fighting game. I would have never played this ever again. Let me be very honest.

330
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:50,760
Um, like I don't really play fighting games. I don't. The net code of fighting games is always

331
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,800
unbelievably awful.

332
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,539
This game

333
01:20:55,539 --> 01:21:00,899
feels like I'm not even playing it online. It feels like I'm playing it and the person is sitting next to me in the

334
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:02,899
room with a controller plugged in.

335
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:06,470
It's just, I'm telling you that's what it is.

336
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:11,909
I've never played a fighting game that was like that. I've never done it. It's never happened.

337
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:17,909
I always play a fighting game online, have half a second of input delay, and never play it ever again.

338
01:21:17,989 --> 01:21:20,310
I'm just telling you the truth. That is what has happened.

339
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:30,039
Being able to play this game and not have to think oh, I have to do my moves

340
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,840
like a second early.

341
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,680
I can't do it.

342
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:42,180
I have to be completely honest. That's honesty. It is.

343
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:50,180
When I play this when I'm playing online, it feels like the person I'm playing against is sitting right next to me

344
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:52,260
and we're trash talking a little bit.

345
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:02,819
I don't know what magical powers it takes to get the game to do that. I heard it's very difficult to get it right.

346
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:20,310
And it's very very good.

347
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,630
Yeah, rollback netcode. It's just good.

348
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:29,689
I would not make that up. I'm serious. The last handful of fighting games that I ever played,

349
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:33,930
I was just like I don't want to do this. It's like it's horrible in my brain. I can't do it.

350
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:49,189
All right, so what's the question mark mean?

351
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,029
We believe you.

352
01:22:51,029 --> 01:23:01,960
You don't believe me. You don't understand. The gremlins movie is so good.

353
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,760
They're both good. Gremlins 2 is better than gremlins 1.

354
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:09,510
Gremlins 1 is a little more serious than gremlins 2, but gremlins 2 is just a big comedy show.

355
01:23:19,539 --> 01:23:21,060
Feral gizmo.

356
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:57,750
He's a good player.

357
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:19,270
Trying to bait me. I gotta learn how to use the um saws better. I feel like I haven't been utilizing very well.

358
01:24:43,539 --> 01:24:45,130
Do I do that?

359
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:52,340
I feel like I'm hearing myself. Didn't I do that? I do I I like just kind of scream make weird sounds like that.

360
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:53,220
Don't I?

361
01:24:53,220 --> 01:25:14,460
Don't do that. Oh shut up.

362
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:27,140
Not you. Not you. Him. Oh my god. I lost the computer.

363
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:37,770
I just wasn't paying that much attention.

364
01:25:40,659 --> 01:25:43,699
Okay, let me let me just get I'm gonna get to it. All right, let me get to the end of this

365
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:49,739
So just let me pay attention now in my brain. I didn't want to try so hard that people are like dude

366
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:51,739
Why is he trying this hard?

367
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:53,500
Against a bot

368
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,899
Like dude, relax, you know, this is not a player like why are you trying so hard?

369
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:06,899
So then I pulled back a little ended up losing because of that, but now i'm mad

370
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:27,640
Here we go. Check this out

371
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:24,140
Goodbye

372
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:27,449
Where's the commentary?

373
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:29,449
There's no commentary on these

374
01:28:30,329 --> 01:28:59,460
Okay, so i'm almost done trying hard against a bot. Well, I want to beat this

375
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:07,180
I don't want to have to retry twice bro is mashing buttons

376
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:17,380
You know what the worst part about um, what you just said was I know that you can tell when I do that

377
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,020
because you hear the

378
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:26,569
Because I can hear it I wish I could turn it off because I don't want I

379
01:29:26,729 --> 01:29:30,489
No, but I like having it on because I like to know when i'm not supposed to be doing something

380
01:29:30,729 --> 01:29:33,289
But I I just don't want you to know that i'm messing up. You know what I mean?

381
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:37,930
It happens all the time

382
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:40,649
I don't want you to know that I screwed up. Does that make sense?

383
01:29:41,619 --> 01:29:44,100
Even though it's an incredibly incredibly useful feature

384
01:29:44,659 --> 01:29:48,149
I'm gonna make sure it doesn't happen this time

385
01:29:48,149 --> 01:30:34,779
Is it weird that ever since i've been really conscious of you saying that i've been playing better because I don't want you to hear this

386
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:41,340
Because that's what you hear the whole time. I play this game

387
01:31:06,279 --> 01:31:10,439
I you got in my head and I heard it and I all right. I'm not even listening to that person

388
01:31:22,949 --> 01:31:25,109
Jesus jerma, i'm sorry. No, it's all good

389
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:35,239
Your head moves around when you do it. That should be a poker table

390
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:59,189
Well, I got I got pocket aces I would be terrible at poker. Yeah, I would get pocket aces

391
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:09,609
I'd have sunglasses on a hat hoodie zip up and pocket aces. I would just stand up and be like

392
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:18,779
Look at that. Look what I got. I wouldn't be able to contain it. I would turn around

393
01:32:18,779 --> 01:32:20,939
I'd like look under again and be like whoo

394
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,579
I would just I'd just be a weirdo and people wouldn't know

395
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,600
But I would also do that if I had like a three and like a three and a six

396
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:35,159
That would work wouldn't it do you think that I could do pretty well in a tournament

397
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:39,850
If I had a three and a six and I did that I got up and did a bunch of movements pointing

398
01:32:40,489 --> 01:32:43,449
Pointing a tip in the hat and shit. Do you think it would work?

399
01:32:44,250 --> 01:33:11,989
Oh my god, why are you so huge?

400
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:13,989
What how did you get that?

401
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:31,029
Is that part of this?

402
01:33:31,029 --> 01:34:04,840
You can somebody said I can throw the dynamite. I don't think you can throw it. I have it before. I think I dropped it

403
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:37,979
Hey, one more tap. Come on, dude. Get out of here

404
01:34:37,979 --> 01:35:15,659
Oops

405
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:02,680
All right good

406
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:27,939
Was it raid who raided somebody raided? I didn't see who raided an engineer. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it

407
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:41,189
I don't know. I can't see it. Welcome everybody. There's no no, I don't know raid song

408
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:48,100
No, raid song you guys are digging up memes from 2021. All right, so I just did it. That's cool

409
01:36:51,029 --> 01:37:03,989
All right, I want let me do some team action here teams. I'm not doing ranked. I got absolutely dunked on

410

411
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:25,430
You should do another meme funeral. I forgot about that stream. The thing is though it worked that worked

412
01:37:25,670 --> 01:38:06,539
All right. This is 2v2. I think why do you hate fun? I don't what I love fun. Hmm. That's kind of good

413
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:20,859
This has got to be one of the wildest group of characters to be in the same room

414
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:33,510
It's pretty crazy bugs bunny harley quinn stripe from gremlins and aria stark. It is very very interesting

Where'd we go? Oh shit, don't say he's so bad. That's the thing that makes every streamer angry

418
01:40:31,539 --> 01:40:42,939
Hmm

419
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:59,529

422
01:41:32,600 --> 01:42:18,039
Have I've only been doing the same attack

01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:19,699
Here we go. All right, it's tied up. It's all set. So it's tied up. I just put the sandwich down

424
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,880
Keep the pressure up pressure pressure

425
01:43:43,899 --> 01:43:46,649
Good, keep it up. Just get the bugs

426
01:43:47,289 --> 01:44:04,699

I got it wrong doesn't matter. It's our I thought I had it lined up right ended. Sorry

430
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:52,659
Remember, why did you eat all my peanut butter? I mean peanut butter lasts a long time

431
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,220
All right, let's do it for real. Don't mess around

432
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:57,909
Let's try to hit my own teammate. Things are going great

433
01:46:30,420 --> 01:47:00,890
So much going on here. Don't get up there. Don't even don't even think about it

434
01:47:07,989 --> 01:47:18,619
Not the will of the gods

435
01:47:26,119 --> 01:47:29,180
Can I hit the jake with the mallet, please

436
01:47:56,039 --> 01:47:59,000
Thank you wonder woman, I really appreciate it you did a very good job

437
01:48:27,609 --> 01:48:33,399
Dude, I can't hit anybody. Why did that mallet not hit? I I don't understand it. Why?

438
01:48:44,569 --> 01:49:03,899
Uh crunchy or smooth peanut butter, uh smooth every time smooth every single time no matter what hey

439
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:13,689
All right, we're going back to strike

We're going to back to one of you once

441

Boom. Oh, okay. I want to play some stickers because what about I can do my banner, right?

442
01:49:50,329 --> 01:49:54,359
There it is. I can put stickers on this, right?

443
01:49:54,359 --> 01:50:10,359
Oh, okay. Definitely this one this one and this one. Oh, I don't have it. That's 20 000. Okay, but I had it

444
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:19,529
Here comes the heat

445
01:50:19,529 --> 01:50:25,380
All right, one v ones. Let's go back to one v one. Here comes the heat play a few more

446
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:42,250
Back to stripe. You look like a ferret today. It's kind of hot in here. All right this time. I gotta relax

447
01:50:42,729 --> 01:50:47,319
I just can't help it though when I play competitive games like this. I just get so

448
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,310
My whole body just starts to react

449
01:51:06,939 --> 01:51:09,739
Uh guys, do I make silly noises like a gremlin?

450
01:51:15,899 --> 01:51:29,880
Damn it. Everybody stand up. No more talking. Here we go

Good dodge. Oh got it. All right

453
01:53:27,479 --> 01:53:31,239
He's sitting on top of a washing machine. That was very funny

454
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:45,539
People can do some crazy combos in this game. It's actually pretty impressive

455
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:56,380
See, I relaxed. I just chilled out didn't make any weird sounds or anything

456
01:53:56,539 --> 01:54:01,239
We were just hanging out playing multiverses. It was easy. It wasn't easy. Actually. It was very difficult

457
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:06,119
It was easy to relax

458
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:07,899

01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:42,949
Here we go

465
01:54:42,949 --> 01:54:45,130
What? How did I get hit by that?

466
01:55:11,609 --> 01:55:34,329
Damn, you're good with that charm

467
01:55:40,199 --> 01:56:22,760
Yo, what?

468
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:24,039
Whoa

469
01:56:24,039 --> 01:56:26,920
Oh, I told you we got this

01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:42,760
Whoa, what happened wrong button? Maybe he's playing really well. I feel pretty good in that one

471
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:49,369
Please if you keep your head still I will give you a hundred subs

472
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:55,800
How do we determine that if I did it right?

473
01:56:57,560 --> 01:57:07,289
I don't think I can do it. You caught him jumping. Oh, okay. He didn't have a second one left. Okay, so

474
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,699
Wait, wait, wait, we gotta do this, right?

475
01:57:09,699 --> 01:57:10,659
We gotta do this right

476
01:57:10,659 --> 01:57:48,970
I just need like a shape and I want you guys to really really pay attention to this

477
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:55,939
Needs to be like a bright red. I mean I

478
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:07,130
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you know what I mean? I I have to make it so

479
01:58:08,090 --> 01:58:11,289
I right because if I come out of the if I come out of these lines and it's over

480
01:58:11,449 --> 01:58:34,409
We'll do it next one next one next one next one next one. Goodness. What were we just doing?

481
01:58:34,489 --> 01:58:36,489
I quit i'm i'm i'm raged with that wait

482
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:42,020

483
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:46,739
You want to play on the fucking edge? Come on to the edge. Let's do it. Come on. Come on here. Come on here

484
01:58:53,180 --> 01:59:24,539

485
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,819
Shake it up

486
01:59:45,819 --> 01:59:59,350
Okay, that was if not that wasn't even a real fight. No, i'm sorry. I have something to do. That was mr

487
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:02,409
Pancake, you're very good. That was very good, but I need to go back

488
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:09,000
Because I need to go back good luck in your the rest of your fights for the rest of the night

489
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:25,909
I have something important to do. I'm gonna try to make 100 subs here. Okay, so

490
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:30,229
Let me get this straight. So if i'm like here, right?

491
02:00:31,319 --> 02:00:37,340
We have to make the camera big so you can actually zoom in and see it and thin enough

492
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,180
How much room do I get is this okay?

493
02:00:45,819 --> 02:00:49,340
Or do I have to not move at all like completely still like this just not move from here

494
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,630
Is that all right right here? Because if I come outside of the lines here that that's it, right? Are we good?

495
02:01:05,989 --> 02:01:08,420
Tell me if i'm in the right spot

496
02:01:08,979 --> 02:01:11,939
Let me itch my face because i'm gonna i'm gonna freak out and halfway through this

497
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,979
Okay

498
02:01:15,979 --> 02:01:29,619
Is it okay? Okay, so don't move from here and I get 100 subs

499
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:57,079
Don't move. I i'm not i'm not I just was looking to see what was in the right spot show them what we got

500
02:02:03,479 --> 02:02:16,710
You got this i'm gonna try

501
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:03,739
As I fucking hate this I need to move

502
02:03:33,319 --> 02:03:40,229
I lost what?

503
02:03:40,229 --> 02:04:03,850
No, I didn't

504
02:05:17,779 --> 02:05:20,180
You know what a harder thing you know how you would guarantee

505
02:05:21,909 --> 02:05:24,069
That you would win that bet against me

506
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:29,189
Is that i'm going to make a screeching sound through my throat with my mouth closed at the end of every match

507
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:43,399
That's how you win. That's a guaranteed victory. I'll try it one more time

508
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:49,479
Here comes the heat

509
02:05:49,479 --> 02:06:15,029
Is that all right?

510
02:06:15,029 --> 02:06:27,300
Right there your ear is poking out

511
02:06:27,699 --> 02:06:33,989
I thought I just got a exe crash. That's what I thought. That was because I wasn't looking show them what we got

512
02:06:36,819 --> 02:06:44,100
Your hair is out. I mean that nothing to do about that hair doesn't count. No, it's it's like my head and face

513
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:31,340
I don't care. I don't care. I just don't care

514
02:07:36,020 --> 02:08:18,970
It hurts to do that. I don't care

515
02:08:19,449 --> 02:08:24,979
I'm so i'm sitting doing this like lock my head in place routine and I can't play the game get these out of here

516
02:08:25,539 --> 02:08:33,899
No, I don't want to turn the stream off

517
02:08:33,899 --> 02:08:46,390
All right last game. This is gonna be the last game. This is it. I'm gonna try as hard as I can. I'm gonna try to win

518
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:52,899
rule of thirds

519
02:08:52,899 --> 02:08:54,949
Here comes the heat

520
02:08:54,949 --> 02:08:57,750
Yeah, again, thanks. Uh wanna brothers for sponsoring this part of the stream

521
02:08:58,390 --> 02:09:01,430
Uh, I genuinely do really like this game. I think it's really fun

522
02:09:02,380 --> 02:09:10,600
It is out season two. It's been out for a while or season two hasn't but season one has you know where to get it

523
02:09:13,539 --> 02:09:15,539
There is a current season

524
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,750
uh game

525
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:27,619
Pass, right i've been losing for fun. No, I was playing something else earlier

526
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:34,699
You don't play it without being sponsored. I play it. I've actually played it a lot off stream

527
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:39,899
On the xbox actually show them what we got on a different account

528
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:54,460
Battle pass. Yeah season battle pass. Yeah. Yeah, there are a lot of mr. Pancakes

529
02:09:55,699 --> 02:09:59,460
Is this also a mr? No, this is the snow guys. It's the same. Mr. Pancake

530
02:10:00,949 --> 02:10:02,949
Let's go down a good one. It's a mirror

531
02:10:42,579 --> 02:11:20,039
Oh, you snuck out. Oh, come on really. Holy shit. How are you still here?

532
02:11:26,220 --> 02:11:27,420
Oh my

533
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:34,010
I am so confused right now. Will you get off the stage?

534
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:19,029
Oh

535
02:12:19,029 --> 02:12:31,220
The spike that's a good one to go on him. That was unfortunate

536
02:12:33,369 --> 02:12:34,970
Yeah, let's do another one one more

537
02:12:34,970 --> 02:12:41,239
You end up getting right to the edge of the right right when I did the down and just caught him at the perfect angle

538
02:12:42,119 --> 02:13:00,090
That's that was painful. I would have been annoyed at that one changing to shaggy. Okay

539
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:09,689
Game is cross play

540
02:13:09,689 --> 02:13:15,109
Yeah, it does. You might run into somebody on the xbox

541
02:13:15,189 --> 02:14:00,329
You might run into somebody on pc playstation really win the final match. We'll find out careful careful

542
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,300
Oh my god

543
02:14:38,020 --> 02:15:35,319
Fine I threw so hard there. Oh, where are you going? Don't even think about it. Oh my god

544
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:37,640
He beat me

545
02:15:48,579 --> 02:15:49,960
Shit

546
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,079
Oh rematch one more. It's one to one. Come on. We're not doing it like that

547
02:15:53,399 --> 02:16:01,699
That stage is hard because all the stuff on the edge. All right, i'm fine. I'm fine. We're gonna win

548
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:22,069
Everything's good

549
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:30,100
Okay, I understand. He's he does he tries to bait you to the edge of the map so he can do the step move

550
02:16:30,819 --> 02:16:34,340
And he tries to jump jump out all the way and do like that's not happening

551
02:16:34,899 --> 02:16:39,780
Sorry, it's just not what we got last match of the night is right here

552
02:16:43,530 --> 02:17:28,500
Okay

553
02:17:29,059 --> 02:17:31,270
That's it

554
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:35,590
I told you we got this

555
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:37,590
He jumped so far out man

556
02:17:44,489 --> 02:17:48,969
He did a max jump then another max jump. I am don't look at that

557
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:53,100
Good matches though. Good fight

558
02:17:53,100 --> 02:18:04,920
Good fight that was a that was tense. I could feel that I toasted back this game just does it to me. I just get so

559
02:18:05,639 --> 02:18:13,219
Intense when I play this hits me in a certain spot and i'm not even that good

560
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:19,379
Some people that are so good at this game. It just they can just do so much cool stuff. All right, one more funny one, right?

561
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:34,579
Let's just do like a joke one

562
02:18:34,579 --> 02:18:36,280
Are you over covid yet?

563
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:38,280
Uh, i've been testing negative so that's good

564
02:18:39,079 --> 02:18:41,270
I definitely still feel a little

565
02:18:41,270 --> 02:18:42,729
sloppy

566
02:18:42,729 --> 02:18:45,350
My throat's still kind of messed up

567
02:18:45,430 --> 02:18:50,059
Um, i'm a little tired still but

568
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:55,540
I am I would say operating probably like 80 at this point show them what we got

569
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:09,479
Did you shave your eyebrows and what thanks for watching though guys?

570
02:19:15,909 --> 02:19:19,299

Continue

574
02:22:05,799 --> 02:22:09,159
All right. That was fun one more for all time's sake. All right fine one more

575
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:21,000
I want to get at least one good lebron game in I try to play him in the first 10 minutes and I just

576
02:22:21,159 --> 02:22:35,209

578
02:22:55,930 --> 02:23:01,799
So if you guys are curious what we're doing, um

582
02:23:29,879 --> 02:23:32,120

584
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:20,629
You know

585
02:24:47,940 --> 02:25:05,290
All right, it's not over it ain't over

586
02:25:07,479 --> 02:25:08,840
I don't understand

587
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:10,520
I turned it into mario

588
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:17,319
I literally just like just like just a frozen frame like about jumping what happened. I said good suck. I turned it into one frame

589
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:25,079
I was just like

590
02:25:26,389 --> 02:25:29,219
I just went that was ridiculous

591
02:25:53,299 --> 02:25:55,620
Level 10 is for the big perk, right?

592
02:26:03,260 --> 02:26:05,620
I'm so sweaty right now

593
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:14,940
You're gonna try god of war. Um, I don't I gotta play the first one through all the way

594
02:26:15,260 --> 02:26:18,069
I'm gonna play the first four or five hours of the first one. Well

595
02:26:18,790 --> 02:27:01,059

Check it out. Thanks for watching everybody. Appreciate it. I ripped like I ripped this out halfway through when I turned around

597
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:03,610
I ripped out my headphones accidentally and I couldn't hear anything. I didn't say anything one more

598
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:07,579
No, that's it. No, no, that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it

02:28:25,479 --> 02:28:34,149
Okay. Nah, that's it. That's it. I had fun

I had my fun

603
02:28:43,989 --> 02:28:45,829
Immediately following this one

604
02:28:45,829 --> 02:28:59,139
Is it immediately concluding this match that's the end of the stream i'm gonna lock in for this one

605
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:10,459
Show them what we got. All right locking in

606
02:29:13,829 --> 02:29:24,389
Play jack too. I've never played those games. All right, here we go

607
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:26,870
Scum like this never lasts long

608
02:29:27,430 --> 02:30:32,309
danger

609
02:31:53,719 --> 02:31:55,719
That was fucking wild

610
02:31:56,549 --> 02:32:03,340
Oh, that was tight. That was very tight. Good match. I thought I lost that one for sure

611
02:32:04,229 --> 02:32:06,229
I thought I was done. I thought I was dead in the water

612
02:32:15,940 --> 02:32:23,479
All right, all right thought about it for a second he thought about it

613
02:32:27,239 --> 02:32:33,750
I feel like I might see him. He might change up. We got to go to sleep

614
02:32:34,819 --> 02:32:38,790
Yeah, I mean you can't go out on that one. This is a oh no. Okay

615
02:32:39,350 --> 02:32:46,840
I mean you when you're in a match like that, that's a best of three. You know what i'm saying?

616
02:32:47,319 --> 02:32:51,020
It's not that late show them what we got

617
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:53,899
7 pm pacific

618
02:33:00,809 --> 02:33:02,809
Can't go out on a heater

619
02:33:04,889 --> 02:33:08,329
Well, I mean it's just this this that was a good match and it's like one to nothing right now

620
02:33:08,409 --> 02:33:43,100
We just gotta make it happen. Let's go

621
02:33:43,100 --> 02:33:59,370
Damn what a move

622
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:05,209
It's too good. That was uh, that's cheese. I got cheese. I got cheese. I got cheesecakes

623
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:18,020
That was a cheesecake move. That was a good match. That was a really good match. We're gonna do one more. I um,

624
02:34:19,129 --> 02:34:21,879
Very good. Very very good match

625
02:34:23,510 --> 02:34:45,079
You got me now. It's time for me to get serious. I you I can't just leave that guy just absolutely slam dunked on my head

626
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:49,879
Shattered the rim all the glass just fell all over me. I can't just go out on that

627
02:34:51,770 --> 02:34:53,770
I got he slammed dunked on my head

628
02:34:54,489 --> 02:35:09,639
Like i've it's one to one right now. You need to take the l it's one to one. Nobody's believing

629
02:35:09,639 --> 02:35:15,739
All right, you gotta believe I know that trick now. I'm not gonna fall for that trick. This is it. This is the one

630
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:19,739
The stage I don't like this stage. Sorry. Here we go. Three two one action

631
02:36:11,270 --> 02:36:13,270
Why did I press?

632
02:36:17,110 --> 02:36:20,069
My fingers are so greasy. Everything's falling off the controller. You have no idea

633
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:52,260
Let's just go to the game. He's just gonna get plays a lot. He's just going to the game. He plays a lot

634
02:36:52,819 --> 02:37:12,200
That's it

635
02:37:17,379 --> 02:37:28,409
All right, it's been fun. It's been fun. Just wipe all the water off the controller can't go out on the loss

636
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:52,540
Polish this up a little you can't leave us like that. No, I can't you're right. You're right. I'm gonna get my ass kicked

637
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:59,829
It's all right. Why am I so addicted to this game?

638
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:17,129
All right. No, i'm good. Those are some good games that play that guy was really good at the game

639
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:22,819
He was just a better player and he got the opportunities, you know, like the catch down like you know what I mean?

640
02:38:23,139 --> 02:39:18,809
This is a good player. All right, let's see how long I can last here get away from the edge

641
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:22,170
I have a terrible edge game. It's like the worst part about all of my gameplay

642
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:05,860
All right, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good

643
02:40:09,219 --> 02:40:12,219
That's not like a seal

644
02:40:12,219 --> 02:40:14,219
Stop, this is a close game

645
02:40:14,459 --> 02:41:19,110
Stop, I can't even land him. Oh, check it out. We only get stuck

646
02:41:19,750 --> 02:41:24,180
Remember you're supposed to hit the other player. I want that person timed out for one second

647
02:41:35,239 --> 02:41:46,229
That was fun. This game's really fun got really into it. All right, I gotta call it. I gotta call it

648
02:41:46,549 --> 02:41:58,739
I'm getting too addicted. That's it. You can't end on a loss. Yeah, I can because it's a quite a few games

649
02:41:58,739 --> 02:42:07,079
I play ending a loss the last few really brought my

650
02:42:07,799 --> 02:42:20,059
My thing down. All right, that's it. Let me look i'm gonna look at the battle pass for a second. That's a lot of fun

651
02:42:21,899 --> 02:42:24,059
I don't really play video games that well

652
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:28,629
Right, but when you sit down and you play a game like this and you just try hard

653
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:34,459
You get into it you get like oh, it's a really great feeling

654
02:42:35,639 --> 02:42:37,639
Good games all the players

655
