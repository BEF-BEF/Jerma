1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:09,779
All right, that was fucking weird. So apparently, I don't know why this is,

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:20,219
but I guess most of Twitch's servers are down. So let me explain why this is possible. I usually

3
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:28,379
stream to a server in Arizona, right? So I picked the Arizona server. That's the one I usually

4
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,820
stream to because Italics and I run from the same box. We both decided we shouldn't probably run

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,060
to the same server. So I was just like scrolling through picking new servers.

6
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,659
Which one of these is going to work? And then you guys saying this stream was fine. So I'm like,

7
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,539
well, let's just go to the same one. So we're both going to the same server and there's no

8
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:00,020
problems at all. So I was freaking out. I thought there was a major problem with like my computer

9
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:08,569
or something. No, it's just all the Twitch servers are all fucked up. I guess that's just

10
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:19,510
what's going on. So welcome. Sorry for that. I wish I was live 15, 20 minutes ago. Anyways,

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:32,459
I need a coaster here. I feel like I should retweet again, but it's all right. Let's just

12
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:41,670
get started here. What is happening on stream today? Well, let me give me a second to explain it.

13
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,950
I just turned it on. I just was able to be live for a minute. Just making sure it's going to

14
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:57,689
work now. Now, now, now, now, now. All right. Everybody relax. I just, I just like dodged a

15
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,730
major like computer bullet. Okay. And this is what we got here. Okay. Hi, by the way,

16
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,610
I'm a little flustered. I'm a little like fucking angry. I've just, I can't help that.

17
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,879
I got to come down off of like being upset because I was really upset. I was just very,

18
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:26,090
very irritated, but not anymore. I think I'm just making sure this is good. Nice table. Well,

19
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,569
this is a fuck you table. You don't know what a fuck you table is. It's a table that you

20
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,490
just do whatever you want on it. You don't really care. You paint on it. You play card

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,889
games on it. You like pick it up over your head and throw it down a flight of stairs.

22
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:47,129
Just because you felt like it. I got here three decks. This is the thing I was talking

23
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,770
about like last week. Probably like, why do you get a fucking iPad here? First of all,

24
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,689
I know people are going to talk about it, so let's just show it. Yes, this is broken.

25
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,539
I don't know if you can see this. All down there is a big crack down the middle.

26
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:11,099
I stepped on this out of bed one day and now there's a big giant lice down the middle

27
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,919
and it's cracked and the volume doesn't work anymore. I was lying in bed sleeping sometimes,

28
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:23,479
but I don't know why I do this. I'm just a fucking idiot. I have an end table to my left,

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,800
so instead of just putting it on the end table when I'm tired, I'm falling asleep and just go

30
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:40,340
hang it over the edge and let go. I don't know why. I'm just fucking crazy. I just get

31
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,379
so tired that I just like hang it over the edge and just and then fall asleep.

32
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,340
I forgot that I did that and I got out of bed one day and I just put the heel down

33
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,580
right in the middle and then stepped again. No, no, no, no. I'm not ready yet. I'm not

34
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:04,360
ready yet. Don't press this button. I've got to be so fucking mad right now. I was about

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,719
to elbow through the screen. I was going to WWE off the top rope through the middle of

36
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:16,040
ice cream. I was so fucking angry. I got to like, how do I, how do you, give me like an

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,779
exercise. Can I do something? How do I like make this right? How do I like change this attitude?

38
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:38,230
I've got such a fucking bad attitude right now. Give me a minute. I have such a bad attitude

39
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:45,100
right now. I can hear it. I sound different. I sound like an attitude boy. It's not like

40
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:52,790
let it go over the bed. Like whatever. I can feel it. But should I tweet again?

41
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:02,149
Everybody like, are we good? Or should I like tweet again? No, I think I'm all right. Anywho,

42
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:07,990
I don't know which one of these I want to play. This game is this like 20 of them,

43
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,310
right? So I got these three. I don't, maybe you guys could pick which one we want to do.

44
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,430
I don't, I don't know. I was going to just like randomize and like let my finger

45
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:27,829
stop on one of them. We've got the clown world, like clown in the town. We've got wild west world.

46
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,610
We've got dinosaur world. So I don't know which one of these three we want to do.

47
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:43,350
Let us click. Well, I think people want to do clown from my, from what it was before,

48
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,100
my understanding. Squeak and sausage. Now I have no idea how this is played. This might

49
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,980
be the worst spring you've ever been to, or it might be the best spring you've ever been to.

50
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,860
It's one of those like flip the coin. Which one of these is it going to be?

51
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,189
But each one of these has a deck, which I very specifically was yelled at

52
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:09,370
because look at this, ready? You open the box. Look at, oh, this is cool. Unlock. Important.

53
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,649
Do not look through the card decks. It's like, don't fucking touch this.

54
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,610
So I'm like, okay. So I haven't even opened them. They're just here.

55
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,160
It says, don't just don't touch it. So I just, so people look, I want people to know that I

56
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,860
didn't fuck with this. Sealed. Inside of the shrink. I haven't done anything to that. I want

57
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,259
to make sure you understand that. I'm not, I'm not trying to cheat here. The goal of these

58
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:42,550
decks is it is an escape game, which pairs itself with this. You pick one from here and

59
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,389
then you've got to escape the game. I don't know how the fuck. Yeah, I've got my

60
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:51,990
fingerprints on it now. All right. So you understand how it works. Well, I mean as much

61
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,939
as I do and I don't really just fingerprints all over this. Yeah. I mean, yeah. You want

62
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,459
to like dust this. You're going to find all kinds of fucking like fingerprints on this.

63
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:05,209
You'll find footprints on this too. You'll find nose prints. Okay. You know what a

64
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:09,449
dog when there's a sliding door at somebody's house and at the bottom of the glass with a

65
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,250
sliding door is there's like dog nose prints, like literally all over it. Like that's,

66
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,089
that's definitely on here. Like I've gotten close before and like my nose is streaked down

67
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,490
the middle. So this is my nose prints on here. All right. I think it was, let's just do the clown

68
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:30,060
one. That one sounds like the most fun. I think that's the one I want to do. And look,

69
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,300
these are supposed to take, you have your timed to do these. You have 60 minutes to

70
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:47,879
complete them. And I'm going to try just to do one. So how do I, let's see. Unlock ages

71
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:58,360
10 and up, 60 minutes, one to six players. So if they, if I had six, okay. I might go over a

72
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,120
little bit of time here because if it's 60 minutes and you can have six people working

73
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,470
together, I mean, I'm going to take the whole 60 minutes, right? It's going to take me like

74
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,279
a long time. All right. Hold on. Important. Do not look through the card decks before

75
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:21,720
starting to play. There's a 10 card tutorial deck and then a 60 card deck. Each deck is

76
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,480
a full independent scenario. Enter an immersive adventure and work together to complete your

77
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:36,789
mission. You have one hour in real time to overcome the many challenges. I got to go

78
00:08:36,789 --> 00:09:13,220
like smell like a rose. I'm going to go get a flower. I'll be right back now. I was

79
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,980
about to leave. Nevermind. I'm not, I'm still here. No, get this off. I just,

80
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,419
God, I got to get this out of me. I'm going to scream. Okay. I think that'll work.

81
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:45,750
I need to like scream. Like I, I'm going to scream. I feel a little bit better. All

82
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:53,450
right. I think I'm good. Did that work? This is like a devil just sitting right here.

83
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,009
There's no angel here. There's two devils and they're both just like fucking throwing

84
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:05,059
darts into my neck. Just like, could you really go get like a drink? But it's like,

85
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:09,059
it's like fucking four o'clock in the afternoon. Oh, I got to just like relax.

86
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,580
I got to beat the clown game. Okay. It's over. I'm live. Everything's fine.

87
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:22,779
Everything's fixed. I got to like fucking get over it. Okay. So I'm like fucking happy

88
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:32,299
Gilmore Ray. I swear to God. All right. Welcome to unlock. I don't think I need this

89
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:42,730
anymore. Do I? Maybe I should put that up here. Feels nice. Get a better table.

90
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,500
Don't push me right now. I'm already fucking flustered. Don't push me.

91
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:54,809
Okay. So you guys are not going to be able to read these that well. So I just like

92
00:10:54,809 --> 00:11:03,429
looked at the fuck. I just saw all the answers. I think the fact there's like a teacher's guide.

93
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:08,200
There's like a teacher's guide. No, I did not. I didn't. Right.

94
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,389
There's no, that's not what's on the back. Why did it? Why did it not say don't look at

95
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:21,669
the back? Oh, do I look at that either? Okay. I didn't see anything. I swear to God. How do I

96
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:29,740
get this open without seeing the answers? I swear to God. There is like a full on cheat

97
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:47,080
sheet back here. Do I, am I supposed to open the deck? I am right? The sick feels pretty nice.

98
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,340
These are high quality cards. I just, I don't know. I just want to see what it's not like.

99
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,240
All right. Tutorial. Welcome to Unlock. You will find all the sensations of an escape room game

100
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,730
in this game. You will be confronted with puzzles, codes to decipher, objects to put

101
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,820
together and tricks to discover. For this first adventure, you are in, you are at an interview

102
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:19,500
in the Unlocked Secret Society on the top floor of an office building. The manager who welcomes you

103
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:26,090
smirks and leaves you in a seemingly trivial room, locking the door behind him. Oh,

104
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:38,169
a secret society. All right. Here we go. All right. I'm ready. I got to get excited for

105
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:45,769
this shit. This is like in like 10 point font by the way. Hopefully they're not all like

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:55,299
this. All right. Launch the app, select the scenario tutorial. Okay. There's like all kinds

107
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:07,080
of weird shit on here. And then press start. You now have 10 minutes to get out of your first

108
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,769
unlock adventure. Are you stuck? You may ask for hints in the application by entering the

109
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:21,990
card number. Oh, okay. I gotta go. 10 minutes remaining. Turn this, turn over this card.

110
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,700
This is the office. Here is the room where you are locked in. Several elements are visible.

111
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,899
You may now search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see.

112
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:44,940
Okay. Search and reveal the five cards whose numbers you can see.

113
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,879
You guys get a good look at that. Make sure you can see that. Okay. Okay. Honestly like

114
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,039
I will tell you what's happening because I got 10 minutes. Okay. What is it? 20. What card?

115
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,019
Search and reveal the five cards whose number you can see. I need 11, 21. There's a fucking

116
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,590
million of these. All right. 21. 21. It's going to be 10 minutes to find these. 67.

117
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,580
Okay. I gotta put this out in a good area here because this 21 is down here. 67 is up here.

118
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Do I have anything else in there that I need? I don't think so. Okay. Wait. Nothing else in

119
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:45,960
there? Okay. 21. 67 is a room up here. 35. 35. 42. Okay. Eight minutes and 33 seconds. Okay.

120
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:54,600
42. And then hold on. Let's get this in a better spot. And 11. All right. Here's the

121
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,519
room where you're locked in. Several elements are visible. Okay. I can see a trash can.

122
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,539
A desk. A window. A switch. All right. You may now search and reveal the cards. What's

123
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:17,740
over here? We got a key. We've got an exit door. We've got a grid with five centimeter

124
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:30,409
apart pins. Okay. We got a locked cabinet. And we also have a TV screen. Can you guys

125
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:36,710
see this shit? Do I have to like turn the brightness up on the sun? Okay. So we got

126
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:51,940
this is the office here. Key. No. Well, I'll play like this. You can combine this object with a

127
00:15:51,940 --> 00:16:00,100
red object or the red number of a machine. To do so, add their numbers together. If the total

128
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,759
corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. So I can combine this with

129
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:13,370
a red object or red number. I can do key and TV. Okay. So should I open the TV with the key?

130
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:23,240
Keys don't have TVs. Add their numbers together. To do so, add their numbers together. If the

131
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:32,360
total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. 53. No, I can't. I cannot

132
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:40,200
use the key on TV, guys. A locked cabinet. You can combine this object. Okay. Key on cabinet,

133
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,629
which means 45, 46. So 46. We're going to do key on. Yeah, there it is. 46. We could

134
00:16:46,629 --> 00:17:01,450
open that cabinet with this key. So then here we go. Ready? Oh, sick. Very good. The

135
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:09,819
cabinet is open. Discard cards 11 and 35. Look closely at the picture. There are two

136
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:22,019
interesting elements. If you see a number, reveal the card. We opened it. We opened the

137
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:36,539
cabinet. 16. I see it. Okay. Boom. I gotta like turn the sun up. I'm turning up the sun.

138
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,259
And give me something like music too. No, that's for the dinosaur one. What's

139
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:57,990
up with the clown one, right? Let me turn up the sun. There we go. Okay. Now you guys

140
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,069
can like see what's going on here. Now you can see what's going on. Maybe a little too

141
00:18:04,069 --> 00:18:17,289
bright. That's better. All right. There we go. So this is a... What is this? Did I

142
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:23,940
actually make it worse? Electrical wire. You can find it. Okay. Combine this with a red

143
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:32,180
number or... I'm running out of time here. Now it's too bright. So I got a red wire.

144
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:44,569
I can add it to a machine. If I have red wire on TV, I think that might be better.

145
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:51,640
All right. Red wire on TV. That's what I'm going to say. So that's 16 plus 42

146
00:18:52,599 --> 00:19:02,549
is 52, 58. No. That can't... No. No wire on TV. Red wire on this weird grid over here,

147
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:11,930
possibly. This is a machine. Single... Your first... Your goal is to obtain a single red

148
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:24,299
number. Some of them... Then add that number to the blue object modifier. Single red

149
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:31,930
number. I don't have a single red number. Are you telling me I can't use that on here?

150
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:40,329
What about the exit? I need... There's a four digit... All right. I see a skull right now.

151
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:53,960
What am I supposed to do with this wire that ends in rings? I... No. I definitely have to

152
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:03,589
put it on here. That's definitely where that red wire goes. Obtain a single sum of one or

153
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:14,660
more black numbers. I don't know what the fuck that's even talking about. I can't like

154
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,859
just use that on here. I can use this on a machine. So that would... But there's no

155
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:35,420
cards in here for that. Just crawl under the door. TV is a red number. Yeah. That's... So I

156
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:46,039
could... But that... There's no card here that could make any sense. You add these two

157
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:52,309
numbers together. 16 and 42. There's no number in here that matches that. Should I just

158
00:20:52,309 --> 00:21:03,339
flip these cards over and see what they are? I have two minutes left. It's definitely

159
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:24,710
this and this. Why would it not be? It's a single red number. I discard these. Should

160
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:37,880
I just get it a hint? Take the 16, add two of the numbers on the 67 card. I don't want

161
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,730
to just... 10 and up, man. I'm not old enough to play this, I don't think.

162
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:59,339
So I'll have to combine like two black numbers together? Not these. I don't even

163
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:10,579
have a hint. Oh, 16. No, I want a hint. Card number 16 could be inserted into the machine.

164
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:17,380
That's what I'm saying. So why... I just did that. So what the hell is going on here?

165
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,730
If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card. It doesn't.

166
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:40,680
Two black numbers plus 16. Like, didn't I discard these? It's a... Discard cards 11 and 35.

167
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:50,740
So I discard these. How do I combine two black cards if there's only one available here?

168
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:07,670
Use the app. Machine. What? Wait, what? Hold on. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

169
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:28,710
wait. This is the machine? I'm dead. Combine this with a red object or the red number of

170
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:51,049
a machine. I have to add two num... Oh, I thought they were talking about like cards.

171
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,019
Single red number. Sum of one or more of the black numbers. Okay, so I thought they

172
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:07,269
were talking about like this shit up here. That's all right. We've only been dead for

173
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:19,240
48 seconds. We can come back. Okay, so we need a single red number from four, five,

174
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:31,049
four plus two. So then add that. Okay, so what about six plus 16? So we've got to get

175
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:36,740
two of these and then it's going to correspond to a card in here. Okay, so 25 minus 16.

176
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,160
All right, I fucking get it. Don't worry. Everybody relax. It's okay. We're just

177
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:56,740
figuring... This is the tutorial. So it's going to be nine, right? Seven, eight, nine,

178
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,569
plus 16. Okay, I thought I had to like do something with this shit. Apparently not.

179
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:11,349
What? Nine. Wrong. I'm going to flip the table in a fucking second and I'm going

180
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:21,000
to play like fucking pee pants. I have to enter 67 into the app? No, I don't. No,

181
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:39,880
I do not. Oh my fucking God damn it, dude. Are you serious? You lose one minute per error. It is

182
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,079
best to first understand which are the right pins before using it. Okay. All right. Everybody

183
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:51,319
relax. I'm starting to understand here. When you have a machine card, you have to use the

184
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:54,839
machine, the actual machine that you have in your hand, which is the iPad device.

185
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:09,019
Should have gotten that rose. Okay. So we need to have 25 minus 16. And we've got this here.

186
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:17,220
We need nine. So you've got seven in the top left and two in the top right.

187
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:32,539
And there you go. Thank you. Okay. I lost a minute. What are you talking about?

188
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:57,670
25 minus 16 is nine. I don't understand what's going on. Can you, can you help me?

189
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:09,619
I don't fucking understand. A single red number, some or more of the black numbers, right?

190
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,269
Sum of one or more and then add that to the, to this blue object, which is the wire.

191
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,839
If the total corresponds to a card in the deck, you may reveal that card.

192
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:31,940
So why did, why can't it just be, does it have to be a certain,

193
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:44,779
how was that? I don't understand. How is seven and two not nine? Why is six plus three,

194
00:27:44,779 --> 00:28:09,420
nine and seven plus two, not nine. So why I did seven and two and it said wrong cabinet.

195
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:22,309
Look at the cabinet. I didn't know that was important information. I didn't know that I,

196
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:35,509
all right. I'm going to start to 25. Are you ready? Well done. You have restored the

197
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:45,509
electricity by placing the wire on the machine. Discard 16, 46 and 67. 16. Discard. 46. Discard.

198
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:57,369
I didn't know I still needed that. Where's 47? It's already discarded. 67 I mean. Got it. All

199
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:06,230
right. The power is back on. Plus six. Plus six is a modifier that you can add to a red object

200
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,630
or the red number of machine. Okay. If the total corresponds to a card in the deck,

201
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:20,859
you may reveal that card. 42 plus six. Well played. The screen lights up.

202
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:27,099
Seven, two, three, nine. Well played. The screen is on. This should help you out to get out.

203
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:36,299
Discards 25 and 42. There it goes. Hey, what you, you can enter a code into the application

204
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:42,410
thanks to these four digits. To get out and finish the tutorial, you must enter a four digit

205
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:50,490
code into the application. What's that? Code. Seven, two, three, nine. Seven, two, three, nine.

206
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:58,180
No. What? No, these are the correct numbers, but they aren't in the right order.

207
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:09,960
Oh, it's red. Red, yellow, blue, green. I got to pay attention to these cards.

208
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:23,240
It's color coded. Nine, three, nine, three, nine, three, seven, two. All right. All right, boys and

209
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:32,390
girls. I did it. I understand it now. I get it. I get it. Check your score. Your time and the

210
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:39,859
penalty is in court. 17 minutes. I used one hint. I lost a minute and I got two stars.

211
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,809
That's not bad. I've never even opened up these decks before. How the fuck am I supposed

212
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:53,450
to know? I'm ready. I think I'm ready for squeak sausage. I think I get it. All right.

213
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:08,759
All right, here we go. Can you guys see? It's all right. I'll read it to you. All you guys need

214
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:16,299
to know is that this is like the Simpsons. Now it is too bright. The sun's like going

215
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:29,940
up in a random. I'm going to zoom the fuck in. I got an idea. Is that, you guys can

216
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:39,130
probably read that a little bit better. I mean, not really, but that's better, right?

217
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:46,490
Enhanced. Now I got this right here for you to check that out. Yeah, there's no way anybody's

218
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,049
going to read this. So what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to like go like this,

219
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:57,670
but even still, no, you can't read that. Nobody can. Just trust me. I'm going to read

220
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02,019
it to you and you'll get it. You'll get the gist of it from there. All right. I think

221
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:07,990
I'm ready. Are you guys ready? This is called squeak and sausage. This is the clown one.

222
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:15,980
So let's get some appropriate music. I need to go get like fucking drinks for this. Here we go.

223
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:26,019
I'm going to go get like drunk tonight for this. Not yet though. I'm going from like coffee to

224
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:42,230
alcohol. That's not, I'm going to slow down. Okay. Can you see? One, two, three, go. Blasted

225
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,390
Professor Nose-Side. Once again, your old enemy has stirred up an evil plan, but you have

226
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,069
courageously slipped into his headquarters to prevent it. While you wander in the corridors of

227
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:59,589
this old shack, a trap door opens beneath your feet and you fall into a dark and damp dungeon.

228
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,660
Your screams will not help you. You are prisoners of the professor. The world is lost forever.

229
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,420
Unless you can get out of here and sabotage the plans of Nose-Side,

230
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,180
you are our last hope. Launch the app. Use your iPad and launch the application to get

231
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:31,140
out of here. Kids, launch the app and select the scenario. Squeak and sausage. Then press

232
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,140
start. Oh, squeak and sausage. This is a hard one. This is like two, this is, look at it.

233
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:47,609
This is like two locks out of three. Okay, kids. Oh, look, it's got like its own theme too.

234
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:54,740
Cool. I'm not going to press the button. Can you see that? All right, here we go.

235
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:03,450
Press, what do I have to go to the bathroom? I might have to pee. Do I, can I, do you get to

236
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:10,579
pee in the dungeon? Is that, does this not work like that? All right, here we go. You

237
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:22,730
have 60 minutes to get out of this adventure. Turn over this card. I'm, you are plunged into

238
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:46,179
darkness. What? But what do I do? Is there a number? Anybody see a number? I see a J.

239
00:34:46,900 --> 00:35:14,760
Is there a J? You guys can't even see. J, I see J. J. There's no J's. Is there, there's no number.

240
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,989
Here, I'll get you the better camera so you can help me. Does anybody see anything?

241
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:31,260
We're going to die down here. It's worse. Does anybody see, I don't see shit. I see a J.

242
00:35:42,739 --> 00:36:00,699
G? I have no fucking idea. There's too much light in here. There's only a J. But what

243
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,300
about, wait, wait, what number is the alphabet? J, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, 10. Right? That's

244
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:22,070
the number that it's corresponds to. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, there are letters in here.

245
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:36,139
There are letters in here. There are letters. See, G, J, J, J, J, J. Look up a J, look up a

246
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:46,309
J. Come on. J, I'm going to fucking drop all these cards. Where's J? Where's the J?

247
00:36:49,030 --> 00:37:12,710
Is T, does anybody see J? I can hear them. I can hear the aliens. Where is

248
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:47,980
J? No, pick them up one by one. A, 72, P, this is P, 4. I'm just looking for the flag

249
00:37:47,980 --> 00:38:04,170
in Double Dare right now. I'm not even playing an escape game. Where is J? This is not even

250
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:44,550
in this deck. Am I fucking crazy? I must be crazy. There's no J. There's no J. It's a lie.

251
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:56,170
Okay, I take it. All right, I got it. J, you grope in the dark and end up finding. Yes,

252
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:12,789
it feels like a light switch. All right, I got it. So that's one. One. I couldn't

253
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:22,820
have just started at one. I don't, I don't see anything. Hidden object. What? I just

254
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,599
canceled something. I just got a hidden object. Wait, I just like pressed the X.

255
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:47,300
How do I get back to that? One. Okay, good. Whoa. All right. We can see now.

256
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:56,440
Get a good look. Okay, store room. Hallelujah. The room that you were locked in from the start

257
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:03,289
is a store room. Okay, we can look at all these other things. Finally, we can see.

258
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:12,739
So we got a fridge. We got a TV. We've got a cabinet. What is M? What the hell is M?

259
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:19,769
Yeah, you guys take a, okay, ready? Take a screenshot. Like put it up on your screen

260
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:24,340
like that. There you go. Okay, now you know where it is. I'm going to say there's a

261
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,739
little pouch over here. Let's go, let's go for M. I'm going to, what's this thing? M.

262
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:34,409
I don't know how much more of this clown music I could take. I'm not, I can't even hear it.

263
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,769
I can very faintly hear the clown music and it's like probably annoying a lot of people.

264
00:40:42,409 --> 00:41:04,739
All right, do I discard these now? I feel like I need, I discard this. M. Can I just like

265
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:08,420
spread these out on the ground? I'm going to put these on the ground. All right, M.

266
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:21,659
Let's see what M is. What the hell does this mean? I'm appearing in, it's like a

267
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:42,619
25, 25, 79 and then plus one. They're all, they're all pluses. Strange. Okay,

268
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,219
so now I mean, I don't know what that means. 91? Let's check out 91.

269
00:41:49,860 --> 00:42:05,460
It's 90. So I have to add those together somehow. I want to like make my own one of

270
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:20,139
these and have some of them like have like, never mind, 91. I'm putting them on the ground.

271
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:25,480
Did I already go buy it? No, it's of course the last one that I got here. All right,

272
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,590
91 is this cabinet over here. Let's see where it is. I'm going to get this in a right spot.

273
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:41,429
Let's move these out of the way. So 91 is like a radio, a dilapidated old VCR. So that's

274
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:47,820
here. That's what's over the cabinet. You're playing an escape room by yourself. Yeah,

275
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,739
I got locked down here by myself. I like fell down some weird hole. It's one to six players.

276
00:42:53,739 --> 00:43:05,260
For those of us that are alone in a room. Okay, VCR. We also got 11. 11 is a TV.

277
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,610
I'm turning off, I'm turning that fucking music off. I keep hearing the same loop.

278
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:23,619
Yeah, I'm not having that play for like a fucking hour. 11. Come on, come on, come on.

279
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:37,340
I got 50 minutes. 11. Got it. This is the TV, an ancient TV VCR combo. And weirdly enough, guys,

280
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:43,619
what detective work can you see there? The rewind button is broken. It's popped off.

281
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,619
Why is that? I'm going to have to figure that out. I'm turning this fucking music off

282
00:43:48,980 --> 00:44:02,260
and I'm going to put on, I'm not putting on doom. Has anybody uploaded like background

283
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:10,409
clown music? Here we go. This one, this is creepy circus clown music. Is that any worse?

284
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:26,010
Okay. I got, I got, I'm timed. All right. An ancient TV VCR. All right. Now we've got

285
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:32,550
avoidable. We got H. See, this is how, this is why you play with two people because like

286
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:39,940
somebody's the banker in monopoly. So this is the fridge. Make sure you guys can still see

287
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,659
everything we're looking at here. Here's the fridge. A high tech refrigerator. It makes ice

288
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:50,340
in different shapes. The instructions are simple. Add water. Choose the shape of your ice.

289
00:44:51,139 --> 00:45:20,150
Enjoy. Okay. So we need what? So now let's see P. That's P, right? P is this door is locked

290
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,800
with a digital code. Here's the exit. And it's the weird doctor is looking at me. So this

291
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:34,860
is the door. And then we got 14, which is this little cabinet over here. That's pretty

292
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:42,599
creepy. Actually. He just like staring at the other window 14. There's a lot of little

293
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:50,650
scenarios in here. Why do they all have to have the alien sound? This is a different song.

294
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:59,269
This is a completely different video. Ooh, a bag containing little seeds. All right. Let's,

295
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:08,409
we got them all. Let's take a look. A bag containing seeds with this. I can combine this

296
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:17,940
seeds, high tech fridge, an ancient DVR combo to VCR. And then this thing over here with

297
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:40,019
pluses and pluses on it. 79 plus. Okay. Put seeds in the VCR seeds in VCR. No, that wouldn't

298
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:50,409
fucking do anything. Seeds into this here. So that's 14 plus 30 right now that I can drop

299
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:54,170
those in there. I can't drop them in the ice machine. That's like a little game. All right.

300
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:02,969
So 14 plus 38. So I need 48, 49, 50, 51, 52. 52. So we're going to combine these. We're

301
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:07,880
going to put the seeds into this little like weird machine. Oh, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait,

302
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:18,599
wait. No, I have to combine them, right? It's yeah, it's 52. How's your fucking Sunday

303
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:32,949
going by the way? What day is it? 52, 52. There it is. It's a machine. So, but yeah,

304
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:39,639
but don't I have to combine them? And then machine 38. This machine is special to access

305
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:49,719
it into the sum of the four pieces which form it. Some of the four pieces that form it.

306
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:13,289
There's one, two, three. Is it 52? The four pieces that form it. 38, one, 25, 79.

307
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:29,179
So just add them. Yeah, there's another piece of the maze. If there's another piece of the

308
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:33,739
maze, then how do I get from... I'm going to put the fucking seeds into the...

309
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:43,079
Makes ice. This is no water, right? These are just seeds. If I get one more of those alien

310
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:50,550
spaceships. What about that? 31. Let's try it. Let's do that. Let's try the ice machine.

311
00:48:50,550 --> 00:49:11,659
31. Okay. 35, 30, 47. Which makes ice in different shapes. Do I need a shape? What about

312
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:31,500
this one? A star. 35. Add this result to a blue number. 35. 14. Can I put it in the bag?

313
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,699
Can I dump it up with the ice in the bag? I don't know. I don't have any water.

314
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:53,449
How do I get water? Can I turn the TV on? Put the seeds in the VHS. Yeah, but I don't

315
00:49:53,449 --> 00:50:00,010
think that... Does a number correspond with that? I don't think it does. Melt the TV.

316
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:17,429
Pee into the ice machine. I don't think that's how it works. Pause it. All right. Hold on.

317
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:27,699
You can only combine... I'm just trying to think. I'm not cheating. I just had to take a sip.

318
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:39,670
When I sip, it doesn't count. A bag containing strange little seeds. An ancient TV VCR,

319
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:49,050
but these are... Can I put the seeds into the TV? I feel like I need to combine these two.

320
00:50:49,530 --> 00:51:03,900
Ugh. 38 requires... I need the other piece of this. So where's the other piece of that?

321
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:13,289
Is it like... Hold on. Is there something I can do to find that? You know what I'm saying? Is

322
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:34,230
there something on this piece that will show me? Use the VCR. That's not a machine,

323
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:40,219
though. 91, that's not a machine. The machine is green. I can't use the VCR. I can't use the

324
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:50,650
TV. I can only... I can make ice, but I need water, or whatever. I can make ice cubes

325
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:57,690
in different shapes. But then when I have an ice cube, I have to combine that ice cube with a

326
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:21,880
blue number. But this is just a bag of seeds. Will it grow into a bush? Am I gonna do a hint

327
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:33,699
right now? Okay. I'm gonna... We're gonna do... Here's what I'm gonna do. 31, and I'm gonna

328
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:39,429
make... I'm gonna take the... I'm gonna make the... I'm gonna take... I don't know. How about the

329
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:48,230
skull? Add this to our tube. Okay, 30. 44. Let's just... What happens with 44? Is 44 in here?

330
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:58,980
Will it do anything? See, this is good, because you guys are part of the other people.

331
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:03,539
There'd be like four people all being like, hmm, where's the TV? And I'm just... I gotta

332
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:09,639
do it on my own. I'm the kind of guy that when somebody starts to say a good idea,

333
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:16,949
I finish their sentence with them, and act like I had the idea, too. So I can't do that right

334
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:26,039
now. It kind of sucks. So yeah, we take the seeds, and we put it into the... Yeah! That's

335
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:38,309
what I was gonna say. Exactly. Yeah, you and I are on the same page. There's no 44 in here.

336
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:54,869
So, uh, this 41, so that's not correct. What about one of the other ones? I'll go back.

337
00:53:54,869 --> 00:54:04,869
Can I just put these two together? 38, 48, 49, 50, 50. I'm gonna look at 52. I'm looking at it.

338
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:10,099
That's what I would do. I would say that. That's not it. That's something else.

339
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:27,190
That's like a big rat. I don't know what that was. Uh, I don't know what to do.

340
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:46,059
The high tech refrigerator. 35 plus 14? 31. 35 plus 14. Ice to the seeds? I'm doing a hint.

341
00:54:46,699 --> 00:54:57,860
I don't care. A hint for 14. You could always try to plant them, but without soil,

342
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:06,860
they're useless. Where am I supposed to get soil? I have 40 minutes to beat this whole

343
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:16,809
mission. I'm gonna just... I only have a few options here, and those options are

344
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:26,019
just combine these with these. So that's 35. So this is, yeah, so this would be 35

345
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:45,269
and 14. Let's just see if it's in here. That's 41. That's 55. 45. Is 45 in here? 41.

346
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,909
I don't think 40... I don't think there's any 40s in here, but that's 41.

347
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:10,230
46. Come on. What? That's not... What are you guys getting 49? 49?

348
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:27,989
Well, where are you combining 49 from? What's 49? 35 plus 14 is... Oh, all right. I'm a

349
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:37,829
fucking moron. Sorry. I forget sometimes. 49. I don't think it's even in here.

350
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:44,250
There's no 49. What's stuck here for... We're dead, and we're gonna die in here.

351
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:58,949
This is 46. We're literally going to die down here. Yeah, guys. We're dead. We're

352
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:11,820
dead down here. We're gonna starve to death. There's a fucking number on here. There's a

353
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:24,820
number. Do you see that? There's a number right there. It's tiny. It's 18. God damn

354
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:35,510
it. All right. There's 18 down there. Should I just grab 18? Do I have to combine it with

355
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:56,329
something? 18. No. The VCR has 18 down underneath. 49 and 18. No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

356
00:57:57,929 --> 00:58:05,269
Why would we go water to seeds into the VCR? I just have to get 18. I see it. I'm like

357
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:21,849
looking at it, right? 18. I don't understand this at all. There's 18 on this VCR, but what

358
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:30,630
does that even mean? I'm gonna look at 18. If there's no 18 in here, I'm throwing the

359
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:57,750
deck in the air. 89, 39, C, 18. All right. Crisis averted. Got it. A VHS cassette comes

360
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:06,250
out of the video recorder with difficulty. All right. Now I got, now I got VCR into the,

361
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:26,380
uh, should I play it? Into the TV. 18 plus 11. Into the TV. That gives us 28, 29, 39. What?

362
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:35,860
It's 29. 29. It only took us, it only took me. I'll be honest with you. I'll be real.

363
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:41,429
It took me that much time. Gotta pay more attention to the random shit that's all over

364
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:49,300
these things. 29. There it is. What is it? Boom. The cassette is not rewound and the rewind

365
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:55,099
button on the old VCR combo is unfortunately damaged. It takes time to come out. Press

366
00:59:55,099 --> 01:00:14,579
the penalty button. Three minutes at such precious time! What? What's the fucking point

367
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:26,090
of the VCR? So what do I do with the fucking, I discard this, right? That's what, that's what

368
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:38,329
that means. I think I throw this away. What is the point of the fucking, so I hurt myself

369
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:43,449
and now I have just a random tape and that don't work. Is there anything on the rewind

370
01:00:43,449 --> 01:01:03,429
button? Use the, use the VCR back into here. 18 and 91. Machine 91. No, I've, what is it?

371
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:16,809
Is that going to work? 18 and 91 is... 90. 90. 90. 90. 19. Uh, 91. 99. 109. Okay,

372
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:30,460
there's definitely not a 109 in here. This is no way. They're all double digit numbers. No,

373
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,159
there's no triple digits in here. No, that's not going to work. I just spent all this time

374
01:01:37,159 --> 01:01:43,320
for no reason. Putting a stupid cassette into a t, into a TV for no reason. No, there are

375
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:51,800
no triple digits guys and this is I 91 doesn't do anything so what the hell am

425
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,359
got 17 visit c c c c c let me look inside the maze there's a maze there I want to look

426
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:13,380
inside of it got it okay I got all these numbers now see there are one two three four

427
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:16,420
five of these numbers but wait a minute that's not this there's more there's another piece down

428
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:21,220
here this is not even the right one this is the wrong one that's that doesn't connect correctly

429
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:34,430
all right that was z t t is this like color-coded wheel down here no okay this draw is locked

430
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:38,909
with a digital code so that I gotta get inside the draw okay get inside I got that this is

431
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:48,699
like that's I got that's the ultimate goal here 24 24 is the glass of water it looks

432
01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:52,859
like on the table here although good luck looking at seeing that good thing you got

433
01:14:52,859 --> 01:15:11,920
me here to explain it 24 there's got a glass of water oh I just the water okay simple glass

434
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,479
of water this is one of my items it's going up here so I got my pouch of seeds my water

435
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:31,409
and then the fridge so I can do 24 plus 31 get the right hydrate you got it I gotta

436
01:15:31,409 --> 01:15:45,579
all right hold on I gotta pull this out so you can see more oh don't I'll show them to

437
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:48,989
you but you guys you guys need to be able to see more because we're getting way too many

438
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:55,100
items there we go that's a little better okay I'm getting more items so you can know what we have

439
01:15:55,819 --> 01:16:01,899
I'm expanding we're expanding okay so this is at 24 what wait don't go anywhere check this

440
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:09,409
before do you see anything on there I'm just waiting for somebody in chat to say something

441
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:21,619
I don't see anything no hidden numbers no hidden thing I don't see shit I think that's

442
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:27,380
it so that was c now we're gonna go to a a is the other puzzle piece I think on the side

443
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:37,659
of the wall there do you remember I told you how I kept on hearing the alien pause it

444
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:43,659

01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:49,409
up this fucking alien sound is pissing me off it's coming from here it's actually like

446
01:16:49,409 --> 01:17:03,520
sounds on the ipad uh I'll show you how do I like turn the volume up all right

449
01:17:45,489 --> 01:18:01,279
minutes I turned off the music okay here we go oh music got it louder 46 minutes gone I know I

450
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:06,960
know we're just learning all right hey I need more space okay sorry I just fucking bumped into

451
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:12,560
a there's another one of these god damn it there's gonna be another one there's gonna

452
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,390
be four of these fucking things how the hell am I gonna figure this out there's like

453
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:27,409
10 numbers on here well that's the correct one there and this is not correct yes it is

454
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:40,670
fuck this fuck you table sucks okay that's a uh what about three four three or seven

455
01:18:41,229 --> 01:19:02,380
let's go three there we go kitchen please do not enter so this is the kitchen can I like

456
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:10,100
skull on the fucking door get skull ice cube put it in the door got it uh before we go let's see

457
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:25,899
seven seven is an entrance and obviously an exit and there's also v there's another layer

458
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:31,359
here I gotta put these together I gotta fuck I'm this is starting to freak me out all right

459
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:40,800
let's move this so this is this door this code goes I'm gonna do like this because I'm

460
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,119
starting to get a lot of things here let's go like that so these are connected together

461
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:51,619
and then this is so I need v now which is another like a close-up of the door

462
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:08,220
v what did I just open the door the door opens onto a pretty garden in the middle of which

463
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:14,619
stands no sides shed laboratory you need to enter an aggressive guard dog stands in front

464
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:19,420
of it it's the impossible to get past it's impossible to get past while the monster is

465
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:34,420
still here okay so he has a guard dog that just sits out front all right um well shit now um

466
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:42,029
go back so this is the water I can do that I can get the cube so I have the water which

467
01:20:42,029 --> 01:20:52,640
gives me number 31 which gives me 30 so machine we're gonna do 31 get the skull

468
01:20:55,489 --> 01:21:09,619
add this result to a blue number 30 and 24 go back let me go back hold on one thing at a time

469
01:21:11,739 --> 01:21:37,229
so this and this makes the ice cube which is 34 55 56 55 55 55 54 31 and 24 is 55 yes it is

470
01:21:38,029 --> 01:21:45,649
is there no 55 shit what do you 54 31 41 oh it's the

471
01:21:46,699 --> 01:21:56,300
ah it's not the number up here it's the number right there it's 54 no don't leave game

472
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:21,619
54 got it ice in the shape of a skull discard um what discard 11 h and 24

473
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:27,859
discard where's what is what number what is this h or 11 I don't have an 11

474
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:36,590
I don't see 11 what number is it is it h or 11 it's too blurry because this webcam sucks

475
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:52,270
and even though it's new it don't matter what did I not discard I h I don't have that all

476
01:22:52,270 --> 01:23:02,300
right so now we're gonna do 54 into three which is the skull so we're gonna do 54 55

477
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:09,979
56 57 this is gonna get into the kit we're gonna have like a whole

478
01:23:09,979 --> 01:23:12,699
another like thing to do I'm gonna have to get like another table

479
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:25,500
56 where's 57 57 opens the door fucking god damn it get rid of three and 54 you got it

480
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:47,140
the kitchen oh shit ah there you can see good good view this so we've got a stove

481
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:54,130
a microwave and then a weird thing over here next to the sink 40 we're gonna do let's go

482
01:23:54,130 --> 01:24:09,699
to the stove first the stove is 89 89 I can do this shit in a minute 89 got it okay let's

483
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:17,760
open the stove it's an oven in which little cakes are baking a message is stuck on the

484
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:30,180
door and that's the message is 73 73 okay 73 is the I need to get 73 there's the stove

485
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:51,260
okay stove oven 73 is the note on the door 77 51 36 73 oh I can't read this fucking thing

486
01:24:51,260 --> 01:25:03,649
it's so small dear the message left by the oven probably by the cook dear professor here are

487
01:25:03,649 --> 01:25:08,770
the chalk cheddar cupcakes you asked for I've gone to do some shopping if you could just

488
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:15,250
add the cheese at the right time it would help me ps to stop the cheddar being eaten by you know

489
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:21,409
who I've locked it in the cupboard I won't give you the code I know you love deduction games

490
01:25:21,409 --> 01:25:27,119
given your intelligence you shouldn't have any problems guessing it ps don't burn everything

491
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:34,750
like last time all right the cheddar if you just add the cheese at the right time would help me

492
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:40,670
stop the cheddar by being eaten by the mouse we already got spoiled on that unfortunately

493
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:45,569
it's locked in the cupboard I won't give you the code I know you love deduction so we gotta

494
01:25:45,569 --> 01:25:54,340
get the code to the cupboard cupboard is 63 let's go go go I have to get another

495
01:25:54,340 --> 01:26:01,680
fuck you table I think 63 bingo here it is a cupboard shut with a combination lock

496
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:11,279
contains cheese and flies so here's the lock to this so this is the lock it's a four digit

497
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:22,699
code we got E E is another one of these is the oh shit this looks like a sausage on it

498
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:34,399
okay so that's complete now but what the hell how do I get to the sausage okay hold on

499
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:44,500
I've got six minutes to beat this so hold on 41 is another I can get I look at something else

500
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:56,050
here 41 there's a little like a window to look through 41 is a window a poster of

501
01:26:56,050 --> 01:27:06,770
questionable taste decorates the decrepit wall questionable taste uh purple red green

502
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:11,939
oh wait that that that that that that that hold on hold on hey look at this

503
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:32,500
how many purple all right I got it no I don't there are one two three there are one two three

504
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:45,840
four five six seven purple one two three four five green and then one two three four five six

505
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:58,319
orange but how does that correspond to this this four numbers is it just the same one two three

506
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:05,060
four five six so it's just gonna be six six we're gonna lose it's obvious very obvious

507
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:13,899
we're gonna lose this one but who cares this is fun okay so it's seven six seven six five six

508
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:22,289
you got it done seven six is gonna this is the desk over here so seven six five six

509
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:34,380
so I need to do a code into code seven six five six the drawer slides open it's overflowing

510
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:52,829
with papers and various documents what the fuck is wrong with me I forgot like where I was all

511

568
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:49,229

571
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:55,579
is this one right add this number to a blue number one plus 15 15 because the seeds no

572
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:13,439
I don't have a number I don't have them I need them I the pills no wouldn't be well I

573
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:35,100
I need the sausage what am I missing here I need like the mouse 63 63 is locked I gotta pee so bad

574
01:42:35,100 --> 01:44:53,020
the oven I gotta pee so fucking bad I brought back I almost just knocked over all this shit

575
01:44:53,979 --> 01:45:01,630
I was really close okay so how do I I need to get a mouse or a rat or something

576
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:15,760
we're back okay I need a mouse or a rat to get the cheese inside of this maze

577
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:25,659
how would you do that do you think a cupboard shut with a combination lock contains cheese and

578
01:45:25,659 --> 01:45:31,020
flies I have the recipe for the cheese recipe is there anything else on here

579
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:37,149
there are the sleeping pills the recipe the instructions and then there's a book ah there's

580
01:45:37,149 --> 01:45:45,300
a book in here take a look at that book you can't see it that well but there is a 37 on that

581
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:53,489
left book I am seriously like sometimes I think that like I'm the smartest fucking person in the

582
01:45:53,489 --> 01:46:14,210
room yeah I am I'm the only person in the room 37 37 so I am technically the smartest person

583
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:19,520
in this room but I also might be I could you know I could be the dumbest person in the room

584
01:46:21,539 --> 01:46:28,829
oh yeah I am the smartest and stupidest fucking person in this room there's nobody else in here

585
01:46:28,829 --> 01:46:32,770
I'm also the most handsome person in the room I'm also the ugliest person in the room

586
01:46:32,770 --> 01:47:03,140
okay uh this is notes music score three three three one three five is there a piano

587
01:47:03,779 --> 01:47:14,560
I don't see like a piano or something three three three one three five I don't understand

588
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:26,619
how that plays into anything else but it is a musical score nothing else on here right

589
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:45,789
this is probably the code this could also be just added together but if it's 18 then

590
01:47:45,789 --> 01:47:58,500
but what would that why would that matter is there 18 still in here I don't think 18

591
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:10,529
still in here 18 was already out yeah well 18 was the uh the cassette tape musical score

592
01:48:10,529 --> 01:48:20,750
maybe the stove I can't like put that away for now let me see if there's anything else

593
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:27,979
there's the door with the dog there's nothing else on there there's a doggy door there's the

594
01:48:27,979 --> 01:48:32,380
cage with the cheese in it there's the fridge with the ice in it that I think I'm supposed to

595
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:37,310
yeah I'm supposed to get rid of that okay I have seeds I have sleeping pills

596
01:48:38,270 --> 01:48:45,760
there's the kitchen the maze which is already done but I need the mouse so I need to do

597
01:48:45,760 --> 01:49:02,369
this shit in the kitchen I gotta do the stove okay cheese and all right let me see this

598
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:12,189
page torn this is the recipe book the start time of the oven is 1217 and it's 300 degrees

599
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:19,310
fill the molds with this delicious mixture and bake for 30 minutes at 300 so that started

600
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:26,779
at three 30 minutes and now it's at 12 minutes and 17 seconds which then bleeds into

601
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:42,989
is could that be is that four digits is it just this oven timer thing let's see code 1217

602
01:49:46,609 --> 01:50:06,560
now it's not 1217 that's wrong is it whatever was before that it's not 8008 it's not that

603
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:22,159
I have no idea add the cheese at the right time the cheese is locked up it's locked up

604
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:31,390
because the mouse is going to eat it don't burn everything these are in the oven already

605
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:39,859
is it maybe it's the time that it already was cooking for I think it's the time it was

606
01:50:39,859 --> 01:51:03,899
already in there for it's a 30 minus 12 seven that's what 17 minutes and 17 17 um 30 40 17

607
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:19,420
40 to 43 come on what what the fuck what is it then how do I get this mouse what is

608
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:38,960
this musical score for what are these the pouch of the seeds for uh sleeping pill sleeping

609
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:51,489
pill for I did wait did I do that wrong all right I'm gonna use a hint hint for 89

610
01:51:53,890 --> 01:52:05,359
the cooking started at 12 17 p.m. therefore oh that's that's what time it is

611
01:52:07,659 --> 01:52:24,239
30 minutes it's a 12 third it's gonna be 12 47 got it you open the cupboard and take the

612
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:33,920
cheese that's hidden behind a cloud of flies take the card 32 all right sometimes you gotta

613
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:44,300
use a hint and we're like 20 minutes over but it's okay 32 a small piece of cheddar

614
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:50,689
matured for 18 months all right I got a lot of things to discard here oh don't drop the whole

615
01:52:50,689 --> 01:53:01,550
deck well I must drop a whole deck okay get rid of uh 68 or 63 which is the one we just

616
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:23,659
opened 63 get rid of 73 78 so get rid of 73 78 63 89 okay so 63 73 78 89 freeing up some

617
01:53:23,659 --> 01:53:34,479
space here all right get that over here so now I have a piece of cheese cheese plus the maze

618
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:52,449
I think cheese because that would mean the mouse would come in no I need cheese plus um

619
01:53:53,489 --> 01:54:04,430

626
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:33,810
difficulty catching it but you succeed in the end now we do this and the fucking maze

627
01:55:34,449 --> 01:55:46,670
well I gotta clean this up move this over here looks pretty good all right I think I can get

641
01:59:49,979 --> 01:59:58,539
was a bad idea because I'll just pretend I didn't do that I was trying to wake everybody up oh it's

642
01:59:58,539 --> 02:00:05,649
because of the lullaby and here I am thinking I gotta like do something crazy to wake everybody

643
02:00:05,649 --> 02:00:11,859
up and it's the fucking music that's playing and I'm I just added I just ruined the whole

644
02:00:11,859 --> 02:00:18,300
playthrough for myself I thought everyone was like oh shit like this I'm bored and I'm just

645
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:26,180
like oh yeah fuck it's all right there's gonna be like 40 penalties but it's not real so

646
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:32,590
okay so what the hell is what do I do then so it's not that one's not this one maybe it's

647
02:00:32,590 --> 02:01:01,649
this one the one that starts in the corner over here this is it that's not it got it 77

648
02:01:07,979 --> 02:01:12,380
snossage all right I got it a sausage it was released when the mouse went over the opening

649
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:19,840
button of the maze's trap door big subs came you know fuck they did uh cyanide thank you

650
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:27,340
for the 10 community subs cyanide appreciate that thank you for the 10 community subs much

651
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:32,539
love to you thank you uh we got the sausage and that means I can get rid of all this

652
02:01:39,819 --> 02:01:46,829
and I can get rid of c4 and 52 mouse is gone desk does not need to be used anymore

653
02:01:46,829 --> 02:01:57,630
c4 and 52 okay all right we've cleaned up the space a little bit now I can take the

654
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:07,920
the sausage and the dog right so I can take 77 plus 49 that's not gonna do anything though

655
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:23,680
I have this sausage anything on the sausage sausage and the pill here all right yeah let's bingo

656
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:47,579
so that's 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 83 83 it's a sausage sleep but the sausage can send anybody

657
02:02:47,579 --> 02:02:54,050
into the arms of Morpheus I don't know what Morpheus is supposed to be but now we have 83

658
02:02:55,550 --> 02:03:06,420
which can be used on the monster right so 83 there's a little doggie door 83 and 7

659
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:15,460
put it like in front of the door that sounds about right I think that's a good idea so 83

660
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:26,989
and 7 let's get 90 maybe he'll come through the door there it is sausage on the door

661
02:03:27,869 --> 02:03:33,500
you open the door slightly and carefully throw the sausage in the garden noises of something

662
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:38,939
being wolfed down can be heard immediately after a few seconds chewing noises are replaced by deep

663
02:03:38,939 --> 02:03:44,699
snores the dog has fallen asleep he will finally be able to get out but no side's voice suddenly

664
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:52,210
comes from a loudspeaker did you really think it would work so easily and I let you go

665
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:57,569
like that click clack the door is now locked the evil professor really does not want you

666
02:03:57,569 --> 02:04:19,789
to save the earth take card five 783 783 and v all right take card five this music doesn't

667
02:04:19,789 --> 02:04:31,229
really fit but it's okay five what's the big secret here the door is now locked so there's

668
02:04:31,229 --> 02:04:41,739
no reason to do any of that what which is back into the door is now locked there's just a big

669
02:04:41,739 --> 02:05:10,399

690
02:08:42,529 --> 02:08:49,310
was the teacher's aid like teacher's cheat sheet this is the one the water inlet pipes

691
02:08:49,310 --> 02:09:01,300
have fallen down you must find the right ones to get water well it's a machine so I can I'm

692
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,260
gonna use the machine over here all right so let's not hold on don't get too hasty here

693
02:09:04,979 --> 02:09:09,779
don't get too hasty we're still going 58 is just the dirt in the ground there it is

694
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:25,170
right everybody everybody do it everybody fucking do it I know you're going to so

695
02:09:25,170 --> 02:09:34,750
let's wait like five minutes for you to get it out of your system I know I need a haircut

696
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:41,060
stop saying it a brown substance granular and slightly damp it's yes it's soil

697
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:53,090
didn't I need soil I need soil for the seeds okay hold on here this fucking

698
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:56,930
super Nintendo music I'm not sure if it's keeping people or driving people away

699
02:09:57,489 --> 02:10:01,890
and thank you cyanide for the 10 more community I got it right away thank you for the 10

700
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:09,579
community sub sign I appreciate it 10 more on top of the ones you gave earlier too thank you

701
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:23,779
all right um R you need to get in this room contains a weapon of mass destruction

702
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:39,170
okay inside his shed is like a nuclear bomb of some sort okay so that's it so let's go

703
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:44,770
ahead and think about this we're going to do the soil and the seeds so that's 58 plus 14

704
02:10:44,770 --> 02:11:01,250
is 58 69 61 62 64 5 6 7 7 7 7 172 tada the seeds are well planted in the nourishing

705
02:11:01,489 --> 02:11:08,079
soil so now we've got seeds in the soil get rid of these two cards now we don't need them anymore

706
02:11:09,550 --> 02:11:19,659
sick okay now we get the we got to do the water here so 50 machine 56 all right so I need to

707
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:24,800
the water inlet pipes have fallen down you must find the right ones to get water

708
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:44,020
but how do I which one goes first left find the right ones

709
02:11:44,020 --> 02:11:55,659
once one okay hold on do I press this button and then hit okay no I'm trying but what do

710
02:11:55,659 --> 02:12:04,180
you mean find the right ones I need one I need one two three I need like four of them

711
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:18,050
or three of them I can't like drag and drop though it's one connection two three maybe three

712
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:24,109
of them it looks like this one here so it needs to go like down down this one

713
02:12:24,829 --> 02:12:32,220
do I have to press them all okay I'm an idiot all right so it's this one and then we need

714
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:40,380
like a little snake one so this one and then we need the this one how does that make any

715
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:54,350
sense we talk about lose one minute yeah because look it goes I need one that goes

716
02:12:54,430 --> 02:13:01,390
down like this so it's this one here right that makes sense that's right there

717
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:10,750
and then anyone that goes bang bang bang which is bad it's this one here and then one that

718
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:24,909
goes bang bang straight down it's this one right here how's that wrong yes yes this is it

719
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:33,229
yes I did it right yes I did it everyone's five it's everyone's like dancing I must have

720
02:13:33,229 --> 02:14:11,550
done it what so two three nine that's nine nine plus 72 wait wait wait it's not even it's not

721
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:27,859
showing the other side why is it not showing the bottom left hold on a minute this it's

722
02:14:27,859 --> 02:14:41,119
not showing me the whole thing over here so it needs to go down down down down okay okay

723
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:51,970
I got it I got it so it's because this is not on here that's bullshit so it is this one

724
02:14:53,680 --> 02:15:00,909
and then it goes this one and then it has to go to the other one down there so it's this one

725
02:15:10,689 --> 02:15:17,069
I have no idea what the fuck is going on here because I don't know why it's missing these ones

726
02:15:17,069 --> 02:15:30,850
on this wouldn't it just be all of them except for one because it would be this I don't even I

727
02:15:30,850 --> 02:15:37,020
don't understand why you would even you got all these numbers here what are the numbers for

728
02:15:37,659 --> 02:15:41,569
at least everyone's having a fucking fun time dancing I must be doing something right

729
02:15:42,850 --> 02:15:58,829
all right so then 16 plus 72 because of obviously this 72 88 bingo was it growing

730
02:15:59,390 --> 02:16:12,140
piranha plants massive subs just came in holy god 20 community subs atrox atrox give 20

731
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:24,659
community subs holy fuck that's thank you that's a lot thank you so much for the 20 subs

732
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:37,579
that's a lot of subs 56 can go 72 can go I can't wait till if I like Moran kids play this

733
02:16:38,299 --> 02:16:45,950

734
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:54,899

orange purple orange purple purple orange what does that mean what is that for it's the musical

736
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:14,579
notes take a look at this shit look at this look at that three three three one three fuck

737
02:17:17,059 --> 02:17:45,010
never mind there's an extra one three three one three five there's too many one two three four

738
02:17:45,010 --> 02:17:51,200
five six one two three four five six seven eight so where are these this is that one

739
02:17:51,840 --> 02:18:04,559
and this is that one so these two are both six or something son who's what the fuck is happening

740
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:15,149
right now flutters just gave 30 subs 30 community subs from fluttered 30 20 from match looks 30

741
02:18:15,149 --> 02:18:23,440
from flutters that's a thank you for the huge amount of community subs you guys are way too

742
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:29,469
generous thank you I was just about to rip this in half but then how would my grandkids ever

743
02:18:29,469 --> 02:18:35,389
be able to finish it that's a lot thank you for the fucking huge amount of subs

744
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:46,590
and I'm gonna turn the brightness up so you guys can see because it's getting a little darker

745
02:18:46,590 --> 02:19:14,700
outside there we go okay um it's something to do with the notes the musical notes but what

746
02:19:17,309 --> 02:19:56,959
it's really washed out now I got you hold on better no better better better okay we got

747
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:04,940
these the timer is broken no because I went like this that this this whole this is meaningless

748
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:13,069
we're just using this for the machine portion all right hidden numbers I don't see anything

749
02:20:13,069 --> 02:20:31,280
on here that's a hidden number I'm gonna have a magnifying glass but when what do I need

750
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:59,940
to get in this room 98 what's what hold on machine no code fuck two three four

751
02:21:00,899 --> 02:21:22,989
well they're three three three five three three three five is that it did I get it

752
02:21:28,459 --> 02:21:43,280
incorrect are you lacking no I don't think so three three how about three one

753
02:21:44,239 --> 02:22:19,700
three one five well three three three six three three three three one five three one six five

754
02:22:20,659 --> 02:22:34,159
three one six five let's see if that does it god what does this have anything on it

755
02:22:34,799 --> 02:22:40,079
it's five look it's this one this one's purple it's purple it's the purple ones

756
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:42,879
whatever the purple ones are there's a little purple face on it can you see that

757
02:22:44,829 --> 02:22:51,520
you can't but I trust me it's purple right here it's a little purple guy all right so

758
02:22:51,520 --> 02:23:02,930
then it's three one four five three one five four because those aren't on there three one five

759
02:23:02,930 --> 02:23:14,579
four that's really washed out but it's okay uh the laboratory contains a huge screen showing

760
02:23:14,579 --> 02:23:20,260
a satellite image of the earth towards which a hundred missiles are pointing how can you

761
02:23:20,260 --> 02:23:26,860
stop it yes look at the ceiling take card 36 he has a bunch of missiles pointed at earth

762
02:23:27,739 --> 02:23:36,579
yeah usually in like these saturday morning kids cartoon villains they like

763
02:23:39,409 --> 02:23:42,770
they don't they don't do anything like this usually it's something like

764
02:23:43,739 --> 02:23:49,170
I stole the ice cream maker and now you'll never make ice cream again and no one will ever

765
02:23:49,170 --> 02:23:54,850
be happy or like oh my like rainbow machine is I stole it this guy is trying to destroy

766
02:23:54,850 --> 02:24:04,700
the fucking earth with missiles this doesn't happen okay so get rid of pretty much everything

767
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:11,860
we got one more really clever puzzle to do to get rid of this one get rid of nine thirty seven

768
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:21,420
fifty one nine thirty seven fifty one eighty eight fifty one is already gone

769
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:27,500
now it's not okay that leaves us with this why do I still have the kitchen and shit out here

770
02:24:28,219 --> 02:24:33,180
all right let's get these in the good view here so we got this machine

771
02:24:34,399 --> 02:24:41,579
a cage is hanging by a chain from the ceiling choose the right maneuver to get down push the

772
02:24:41,579 --> 02:24:48,139
lever to the left take card g to do that or push the lever to the right take card d this

773
02:24:48,139 --> 02:24:57,860
might be a death scenario so push the lever to the left or the lever to the right so if

774
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:09,540
I push the lever to the right that would mean we would be going this way so this way which

775
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:20,530
would make this purple one go this way which would make you know it's the same amount of

776
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:26,290
it's the same chance as roulette so I mean just put it on black or red uh I'm gonna

777
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:45,309
say put it on red we're gonna push it over to the right this way means it'll go this way

778
02:25:45,389 --> 02:25:56,129
which will spin this this way which will move this one this way which will move this one

779
02:25:58,270 --> 02:26:08,620
this way which will move this one this way which will move this one this way and it'll go down

780
02:26:09,579 --> 02:26:36,860
we're taking card d it's to the right d here we go nothing in my hand right

781
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:46,780
nothing in my hand at all got nothing the cage slowly descends creaking it is closed by a coded

782
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:50,459
lock hurry to open it and press the button that will stop the destruction of the planet

783
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:59,459
I think that already happened see I don't know I haven't been outside in like fucking probably

784
02:26:59,459 --> 02:27:03,620
four hours so I might just be in the bunker and the earth is probably gone

785
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:12,399
hurry to open it and press the button what do you mean how do I hurry up hurry hurry hurry

786
02:27:12,399 --> 02:27:24,989
okay the cage slowly what's what's the code I see okay I see uh dash you see that on the bottom

787
02:27:24,989 --> 02:27:31,340
of the cage there's a dash star dash dash dash star dash star dash dash dash star dash is that

788
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:48,059
morse code I'll show it to you look these the it's so fine it's hard to see it so one

789
02:27:50,590 --> 02:28:00,850
hurry up and do it before the before the bomb explodes one one three one three one one three

790
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:14,459
one three one um congrats what do you mean congrats why is everybody saying good job

791
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:39,069
congrats oh the music okay um I'm like we're getting like gross lips right now the cage

792
02:28:39,069 --> 02:28:48,770
slowly hurry up or the planet will be destroyed dash star dash one three one three

793
02:28:48,770 --> 02:29:03,780
one one three one one one three one one what's that mean one one two three four and two

794
02:29:07,069 --> 02:29:23,170
I don't know read it upside down dash no that doesn't do anything uh code I'm gonna say

795
02:29:23,889 --> 02:29:35,260
all right we got move this out of the way um it's four digits so I don't fucking have any idea

796
02:29:35,260 --> 02:29:52,819
what this the star this is two different numbers one three one three one three one

797
02:29:57,360 --> 02:30:18,079
one four three one one four fucking everyone's dead by this point this cage makes you think

798
02:30:18,079 --> 02:30:28,739
of a code with bars where do we usually find bar codes how the hell does that help me I know

799
02:30:32,860 --> 02:31:09,020
look for the answer on am I really getting that'll be solid right now this is not even

800
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:34,909
the right box where's the bottom of the box there's a there's the barcode uh it is you

801
02:31:34,909 --> 02:31:41,059
gotta be fucking kidding me it's this barcode on the bottom that's the actual barcode on the

802
02:31:41,059 --> 02:31:47,459
box that I would have never figured that out in a million years I would have gave up I would

803
02:31:47,459 --> 02:31:50,340
have had to quit I would think that I would have just started I would have started flipping

804
02:31:50,340 --> 02:32:04,590
cards over the code is three five eight three what no no no no no no no no the code is

805
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:27,250
five eight zero six that's that's some metal gear solid shit right there press the button

806
02:32:27,250 --> 02:32:32,049
and no sides evil device stops after releasing a few electrical flashes well done you have saved

807
02:32:32,049 --> 02:32:56,770
the world that's all folks what about these other cards now that was not 112 minutes I

808
02:32:56,770 --> 02:33:01,010
pressed the button a million times 60 minutes of added stuff I would it would have been three

809
02:33:01,010 --> 02:33:12,639
stars I would have been I would have had a nice three stars on this I would have I pressed

02:40:35,620 --> 02:40:41,579
was like 20 minutes for that I had no idea what the hell I was doing Wild West or dinosaurs

841
02:40:41,579 --> 02:40:49,780
I'm gonna say dinosaur this one apparently is hard this is the hardest one that I have

842
02:40:50,739 --> 02:40:58,940
so I gotta fucking get this shit done in exactly one hour and for every penalty I have

843
02:40:58,940 --> 02:41:13,139
to drink I'm just kidding I'm not doing that is this one ages 12 and up this one is is

844
02:41:13,139 --> 02:41:17,760
still 10 and up all right I'm not gonna reveal the deck yet and hold on you know what I'm gonna

845
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:24,239
make this faster I'm gonna make this quick hold on all right let me go let me go let me get

850
02:43:42,530 --> 02:44:02,959
hold on I've got uh some sake and my company is out of fucking business shot glass look at

851
02:44:02,959 --> 02:44:29,309
that and my liquidated company shot glass rip machinima you're drinking liquid evil

852
02:44:29,309 --> 02:44:41,299
why do you say that to drink with every card poll I am not gonna fucking do that

853
02:44:41,299 --> 02:44:44,260
pull for which deck all right that's the hour you know if this is gonna be the one

854
02:44:45,309 --> 02:44:49,629
this is the one then this uh that's a good idea we'll pull with the dinosaurs or wild

855
02:44:49,629 --> 02:45:02,000
wild west I am already messing up my words this is the reason why anybody voted for this

856
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:08,719
hey you want to do another fucking card game no no no anything but that do anything else

857
02:45:08,719 --> 02:45:21,469
I don't want to see this again hey I'm gonna be drinking okay all right that sounds great do

858
02:45:21,469 --> 02:45:33,229
that all right let's do uh dinosaur or wild west you all right give me another poll because

859
02:45:33,229 --> 02:45:43,860
that makes sense we should do it like that you only do boring shit drunk would you rather

862
02:46:06,059 --> 02:46:09,340
all right guys which one do you want to see which deck this is important this is the last

863
02:46:09,340 --> 02:46:16,399
time you're gonna see this you should play just dance um why would I ever turn that game on

864

03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:49,790
no no no no it's not 1050 it would be it would be no it's 50 10 I don't want to

948
03:01:49,790 --> 03:02:03,969
lose any more time five fucking thousand subs around the line oh my god I just lost

949
03:02:03,969 --> 03:02:34,979
fucking 10 whole minutes what's the wiggly line what's this painting 14 14 14 14 I'm

950
03:02:34,979 --> 03:02:42,879
fucking doing I'm trying so hard 14 I can see 14 in the corner for the painting 16 80 99 25

951
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:59,870
give me who is fucking 14 what it's a uh a coconut behind the painting you find a strange

952
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:07,840
coconut coconut smash the coconut with it with the with the horn 42 okay a high quality shoe

953
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:20,819
horn smashed the coconut 42 plus 14 is 42 52 56 it's right on top 56 is right on top

954
03:03:21,620 --> 03:03:28,799
smash the coconut I am so fucking I'm on top of this right now I ain't gonna lose

955
03:03:30,139 --> 03:03:35,860
I need to discard pile up here the coconut opens in the middle it holds a mysterious machine

956
03:03:37,600 --> 03:03:48,190
latitude longitude what is that 56 machine 56 enter destination latitude no longitude no

957
03:03:48,190 --> 03:04:00,430
I need a map a map that's uh I need latitude and longitude all right I gotta get a map I gotta

958
03:04:00,430 --> 03:04:08,159
find a map okay okay got a candle this painting still okay I don't I don't have it I got

959
03:04:08,159 --> 03:04:24,420
nothing for that what how do I get in this fucking book was it supposed to 36 15 thought

960
03:04:24,420 --> 03:04:36,829
of getting a fucking book f and c f I don't know how to get in the book I don't know what this

961
03:04:36,829 --> 03:04:50,559
even means I know it's Fahrenheit and Celsius but there's nothing no other information on

962
03:04:50,559 --> 03:05:00,690
this book to give me any leads I it's like not 50 and 10 so what the hell is it Fahrenheit

963
03:05:00,690 --> 03:05:08,340
Celsius I got no longitude I got no latitude I've got a painting but there's nothing on that

964
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:30,719
painting I got this weird scissors rock paper scissors lemons can I burn these two oh 50 60

965
03:05:30,719 --> 03:06:11,870
70 80 86 87 89 burn the burn it now come on come on 89 89 89 89 89 89 80 88 87 89 what 36

966
03:06:16,159 --> 03:06:22,479
all right what the fuck after just okay discard 36 and 53 get rid of these I just didn't okay

967
03:06:22,479 --> 03:06:32,860
discard what the fuck does this even say woods in the form of our voyage and a few of natural

968
03:06:32,860 --> 03:06:39,500
history and g-toe could of interest to the general public help enter both latitude and

969
03:06:39,500 --> 03:06:50,100
longitude rates by teleporter to our the five of us we are in great danger ned each coordinate

970
03:06:50,100 --> 03:07:01,700
is made of a car followed by two I will nobody can read that each there's more of this I'll

971
03:07:01,700 --> 03:07:17,579
help you with the it is for minute uh each coordinate is made of a car followed by two

972
03:07:17,579 --> 03:07:24,780
I will help you with the it is the four minutes and look on the lower right side for the other

973
03:07:24,780 --> 03:07:51,409
row beat the and enter challengers initials lower right side of what of the car look on

974
03:07:51,409 --> 03:08:02,319
the lower right side of the car I have to get into this book Fahrenheit Celsius it's 50 and

975
03:08:02,319 --> 03:08:17,950
then this is 10 but then there's that weird little symbol that's flying around what is

976
03:08:17,950 --> 03:09:01,149
that symbol is there like a squiggly latitude no that's not it it's his initials and then

977
03:09:01,149 --> 03:09:19,219
something I'd have no idea enter both latitude and longitude rates be teleported to our

978
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:30,659
the five of us we are in great danger hey what the rock n rock e scissor w paper

979
03:09:31,299 --> 03:10:13,329
fuck does this even mean dot dot dash dot dash dot dash dot is it f and c on here

980
03:10:13,329 --> 03:10:24,590
yeah but that's just morse code but how but that I need to translate that into four digits

981
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:58,450
50 10 I tried 50 10 earlier it didn't do anything this is fucking bogus this painting

982
03:10:58,450 --> 03:11:12,479
is Japanese but what I don't have that information in my book how the fuck you

983
03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:21,520
supposed to do this in 60 seconds I mean very clearly f and c are right here why would it be

984
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:45,489
f and c with that the the squiggles around it these are just the dinosaurs as in there's no

985
03:11:45,489 --> 03:12:04,819
squiggly lines you see squiggly lines on here I don't it seems g e challenger is his initials

986
03:12:04,819 --> 03:12:18,079
so it's g e 50 10 wait there was there was squiggly where were that where were we talking

987
03:12:18,079 --> 03:12:28,340
about where what are you talking about what do you see them I don't see them what I mean

988
03:12:28,340 --> 03:12:44,719
right there where do you see these no you're lying to me there's nothing here I'm I there's

989
03:12:44,719 --> 03:12:56,909
nothing on this map that has squiggly lines on it I can't even get the fuck out of this first puzzle

990
03:12:56,909 --> 03:13:21,680
wait wait wait wait is there f and c here g e but then I need the longitude and latitude

991
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:31,620
but it's a rock and paper scissor f c but is the the wave the is this the wave the painting

992
03:13:31,620 --> 03:14:01,059
14 c is 14 no what the fuck there's no and no there's no lettered cards c is in blue is

993
03:14:01,059 --> 03:14:05,840
for celsius f is for fahrenheit so what the fuck are you talking about game

994
03:14:09,149 --> 03:14:22,500
f is clearly on 50 c is very clearly on 10 50 10 how does this make no sense I tried that already

995
03:14:22,500 --> 03:14:40,430
g e 50 10 on this on this dumb machine no but this is like latitude latitude north

996
03:14:41,469 --> 03:14:46,930
look scissors this doesn't make any sense this makes no sense

997
03:14:49,540 --> 03:14:59,200
you I've rock paper scissor and then 50 and 10 is this like element shit

998
03:15:02,940 --> 03:15:51,389
rock is north but what is rock sees north rock east scissor no fucking idea like like zero

999
03:15:51,389 --> 03:15:57,219
idea what the hell they want me to do there's no way I'm gonna do this I'm gonna okay minus

1000
03:15:57,219 --> 03:16:06,129
five fucking thousand subs this is the it's not possible what the fuck are you talking

1001
03:16:06,129 --> 03:16:16,110
about okay let me tell you how dumb this is okay the apparently the red number is for

1002
03:16:16,110 --> 03:16:31,180
boiling temperature why would I ever ever ever ever ever think that how would I what information

1003
03:16:31,180 --> 03:16:49,899
is here boiling temperature what I'm gonna boil the card so it's two oh but boiling in

1004
03:16:49,899 --> 03:16:57,940
fahrenheit is was what two two twelve so two twelve and then the celsius is just what for

1005
03:16:57,940 --> 03:17:06,000
freezing which is zero two one two zero what a dumb fucking thing well yeah by the way that

1006
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:11,440
means it's boiling now if you didn't catch that this game owes me five thousand subs

1007
03:17:12,239 --> 03:17:32,370
it's not over five take the card five padlock opens five a number is at the bottom of the

1008
03:17:32,370 --> 03:17:35,969
book page oh there's a really there is yep thank you for that I just I didn't I didn't

1009
03:17:35,969 --> 03:17:43,709
press that it scared me okay there we go 36 minutes I can do it discard how am I supposed

1010
03:17:43,709 --> 03:17:48,879
to read the book is open it's a it's it says 34 and there's a I'm not supposed to read that

1011
03:17:48,879 --> 03:18:16,079
okay it's a bunny and a lady 34 come on come on please I'm fighting for my life here 34

1012
03:18:16,079 --> 03:18:26,610
look at how do you see how much text is on this this volume holds in the form of a diary

1013
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:30,850
the account of our voyage and a few short remarks about natural history in geology

1014
03:18:30,850 --> 03:18:35,409
that I believe could be of interest to the general public we needed to study the lands

1015
03:18:35,409 --> 03:18:41,090
and follow the right coordinates left behind by the previous explorer so to confirm whether or

1016
03:18:41,090 --> 03:18:45,569
not there was a hidden valley in which huge animals hid and needed to be saved from the

1017
03:18:45,569 --> 03:18:53,120
desert people who killed them out of fear we also wanted to check on the coordinate pointing

1018
03:18:53,120 --> 03:19:00,219
to a bird called the red cardinal presumably living on the highest point we were missing

1019
03:19:00,219 --> 03:19:06,059
several of the digits and therefore we couldn't find the latitude we went as far this is a joke

1020
03:19:06,780 --> 03:19:16,770
the text gets smaller they couldn't fit it so they shrunk it we had planned to we went as

1021
03:19:16,770 --> 03:19:21,170
far as we could to the south we had planned to stay but after a few seconds we were attacked

1022
03:19:21,170 --> 03:19:44,610
by a very big dinosaur and chased by an even bigger rabbit there's like lines going through

1023
03:19:44,610 --> 03:20:11,840
this l c d g the line is what disaster there's clearly a line here going through

1024
03:20:12,559 --> 03:20:30,379
they're supposed to do this in an hour no way more like two or three i have to read

1025
03:20:30,379 --> 03:20:49,649
this whole essay again hold on does this even mean cardinals check on the coordinate

1026
03:20:49,649 --> 03:21:20,430
pointing to a bird the red cardinal i want to see a dinosaur i got no fucking idea

1027
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:30,340
bird called the red cardinal presumably living on the highest point we were missing several of

1028
03:21:30,340 --> 03:21:38,770
the digits and therefore we couldn't find the latitude we went as far as we could to the south

1029
03:21:38,770 --> 03:21:42,209
we had planned to stay but after a few seconds we were attacked by a dinosaur

1030
03:21:42,770 --> 03:22:15,899
camp i'm gonna smash the table this is like so convoluted i need magnifying glasses to read

1031
03:22:15,899 --> 03:23:14,540
this camp for stream central lake there's no bird on here rapid and a lady none of this

1032
03:23:14,540 --> 03:23:22,700
makes any sense to me just give me a hint i don't i don't even understand the rabbit has a strange

1033
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:48,879
posture what is it playing at what is supposed to be like a constellation rock he's doing rock

1034
03:23:51,059 --> 03:24:10,239
but but who cares he's doing rock north rabbit north north rock north is she doing paper

1035
03:24:21,309 --> 03:24:30,959
north but what does the rabbit even mean is it like a rabbit up north a rabbit named anything

1036
03:24:31,600 --> 03:25:02,000
i don't even have this still up here have i tried solving the puzzle i'm returning this one this

1037
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:22,290
one doesn't count no this one don't count it's like it's like you got to find like this one

1038
03:25:22,290 --> 03:25:28,940
little thing how did you not know that the f was talking about boiling water you're supposed

1039
03:25:28,940 --> 03:25:32,540
to know that the rabbit was pointing to a rock which was the cardinal which the cardinal

1040
03:25:33,500 --> 03:25:49,090
oh give me a break but i dude your driving exam your driver's ed exam has text bigger than this

1041
03:25:49,729 --> 03:26:04,059
when you put your eyes in the fucking microscope thing when you do like the test to see if you

1042
03:26:04,059 --> 03:26:11,700
need glasses for like the driving exam they're bigger than this so thankfully i don't need

1043
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:30,450
glasses to operate a car we went as far south as we i rock north rabbit i don't know rabbit

1044
03:26:30,450 --> 03:26:42,559
north rock but what is rock rock is rock on here coconut painting doesn't do anything

1045
03:26:44,379 --> 03:27:13,260
they've hidden numbers 34 we already have 34 34 anything on the cardinal how is this ages 10

1046
03:27:13,260 --> 03:27:24,110
plus no no you got helped by like four adults you're not doing this at 10 plus you can't even

1047
03:27:24,110 --> 03:27:32,559
fucking read at 10 you can't read at 10 years old age is 10 enough no that's like

1048
03:27:32,559 --> 03:27:49,899
the fucking esrb rating there's no blood in this game no idea i'm just give me the

1049
03:27:49,899 --> 03:27:57,899
fucking solution i'm done i have the solution here i don't care uh this makes no sense

1050
03:27:58,620 --> 03:28:17,139
okay so it's here's listen to me okay it's north it's the page it's the pages in the book

1051
03:28:18,239 --> 03:28:53,579
that are the no no one would why would you ever that's not even like it's bullshit

1052
03:28:54,459 --> 03:28:59,260
uh and you know it you all know it i don't need i don't have to say anything you know it

1053
03:28:59,819 --> 03:29:09,340
it's the page is the page is the latitude not like any of this other it doesn't matter

1054
03:29:09,340 --> 03:29:38,959
i got a lot on the line here four and where's 89 already over there now what this okay this

1055
03:29:38,959 --> 03:29:52,079
just changed this is now uh very important apparently you have been you've been teleported

1056
03:29:52,079 --> 03:29:57,680
to challenger's base camp in the lost valley you must find ned to obtain a better score you

1057
03:29:57,680 --> 03:30:01,680
will have the opportunity to find and save the other members of the expedition their health

1058
03:30:01,680 --> 03:30:09,180
deteriorates every night use the app to indicate your movements and take the shown cards to

1059
03:30:09,180 --> 03:30:18,450
reconstitute the map to interact with a card with an anchor you must be on its space

1060
03:30:19,090 --> 03:30:24,209
the other objects are transported with you good luck and be careful now take card 81 it's

1061
03:30:24,209 --> 03:30:49,010
the first part of the map 81 the air is humid and stuffy so we got the tent and then the ground

1062
03:30:49,010 --> 03:31:22,559
so 93 45 did i go by 93 already am i is the timer still on 93 and 45 you got an empty bottle

1063
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:42,829
and a used chalk stick day one okay chalk and bottle i'm i'm gonna any hidden numbers like

1064
03:31:42,829 --> 03:31:53,360
buried in the back of the tent i don't think so uh we're gonna go left you come to a mangrove

1065
03:31:53,360 --> 03:32:22,690
take the card 87 we're gonna get like that timer erupt 88 90 75 27 87 okay there's a

1066
03:32:22,690 --> 03:32:33,420
there's a pterodactyl here uh let's uh four i guess we're gonna see what the pterodactyl

1067
03:32:33,420 --> 03:32:38,620
does can we tame the pterodactyl this strange creature is playing with a rope

1068
03:32:40,260 --> 03:32:45,149
empty bottle and rope there's also an anchor though what's the anchor mean again

1069
03:32:45,870 --> 03:32:56,399
you must be on its space okay you have to be i have to be on the anchor space to use that

1070
03:32:58,930 --> 03:33:06,219
so i have to be here can i do rope and bottle what would that what would that even do

1071
03:33:06,860 --> 03:33:29,500
well let's do 26 a torch chalk bottle torch pterodactyl uh the torch is not

1072
03:33:31,260 --> 03:33:38,110
i don't think i can do anything about this day two a vast lowland is laying in front you take 52

1073
03:33:38,110 --> 03:33:56,610
okay there's a buck a huge deer stands in this lowland it looks peaceful 40 a huge rock

1074
03:34:00,180 --> 03:34:11,520
okay we got a huge rock torch bottle can i light the rock on fire i don't think so torch on

1075
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:23,020
rock chalk on rock chalk on rock mark the rock let's go right swampy you're moving slowly in

1076
03:34:23,020 --> 03:34:48,559
a swamp 82 84 13 28 come on 82 82 i'm running out of room here 82 that is a huge animal's

1077
03:34:48,559 --> 03:34:53,680
trudge in the marsh we need seven and 21 i'm gonna have to fucking knock the table over and

1078
03:34:53,680 --> 03:35:01,709
just do it on the ground use rock on self like smash the rock into my own head i don't think

1079
03:35:01,709 --> 03:35:25,329
that's a good idea seven there it is a boot a lightly laced shoe okay shoe look at the swamp

1080
03:35:25,329 --> 03:35:54,959
water 21 what does that mean 20 21 23 19 31 21 there's a gun in here uh roxton's rifle his

1081
03:35:54,959 --> 03:36:04,450
name is engraved on the butt okay i got a gun machine 21 use gun how many bolts
