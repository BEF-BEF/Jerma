1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:13,769
Okay, I'm back. So, Vampire Survivors. This is not the first time I've played this game.

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,320
Holly and I used to, when it first came out, really just grind this. I've played a lot of this so far,

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,810
but it was really when it first came out, so I have not played it in like six or seven updates.

4
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:49,270
I did play a lot of it though, so I'm very seasoned. If you don't know what this game

5
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,390
is, then you're in for a treat, because the game is actually incredible. Okay, let's get it open.

6
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:17,109
I might be a little rusty. It has been a while. We'll find out. No wobble dogs? No, I won't play

7
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:28,700
this. So, I don't know how to get like the new... There's a bunch of new characters, I think. I do

8
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:42,170
need to turn it up though. That is far too low. How's that? Better? Okay, can you see? I don't

9
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:56,569
think you can see yet. Hold on. You can't even see me. No. This is creepy. Okay, let's get it up here.

10
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:30,340
Fucking glover. Can you see it? No? I've never captured this game before. Do I have to capture

11
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:40,699
the... I probably have to capture the window. That would make sense, wouldn't it? Oh, let me get it.

12
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:59,689
Hold on. Okay, there it is. I should be able to see it now. Okay, that's not correct. That is also

13
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:10,280
not correct. That is not correct either. Hey, look at that. Okay, I got a lot of money, as you see.

14
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,620
I got a lot of cash. I play with a controller. Does that make me a shitty person? Does that make

15
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:29,270
me bad? How come it's not... There we go. Okay. Yeah? Does it make me bad at the game? I know,

16
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,469
you just move around. You literally just walk around. All right, so let's get started. So, start.

17
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:38,870
You want to see what I've done. I've gotten to level 20 in the forest. This, all this shit. Yeah,

18
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:48,389
I don't even know what this is. A hundred? I've survived 10 minutes. All right, let's just go.

19
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:54,379
Want to see my collection? So, they added a lot of stuff, huh? There's like a whole row of new

20
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:04,229
items. I'm interested. So, who should I play with? I like this guy with the bones. You get more... Oh,

21
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:10,819
wait, wait, wait. I need to do my unlocks. Oh, power-ups, yeah. So, did they add any new power-ups?

22
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:22,759
Revive once with 50% health? That seems kind of insane. Curse. Increases enemy speed, health,

23
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:32,810
quantity, and frequency by 10% per rank. Why would you want to do this? That feels kind of like...

24
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:40,060
Just make the game harder? It's a challenge run. Oh, okay. I'm going to try this. I'll take this one.

25
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,529
And then I usually take the damage one. I love the damage one. And by the way, the money I got,

26
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:51,670
because as you play the game, you just get money and you can spend it however you want. You can

27
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,970
refund it whenever you want as well. I know I'm making a lot of motions and gestures towards you.

28
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,199
You can refund it whenever you want. All right, so this is damage. 5% damage per rank. I'm just

29
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:15,180
going to do this max. What else did I like used to do? Pull down. Oh, more projectiles. Hell yeah.

30
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:29,459
Move speed. Hell yeah. Luck. Hell yeah. More coins? Yeah. What else is good? I forget. I haven't

31
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:37,540
played in like three or four months. Probably area. All right. Attack speed. Oh, that's right.

32
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:47,079
I don't really care about the magnet thing, although it's very helpful. Read. Max health.

33
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:55,939
Duration. Yeah, whatever. I mean, it's been a while, but I'm just going to fucking put points

34
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:00,170
away. It doesn't matter. All right, let's go. I'm going to play with the bone guy. So I get

35
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:12,790
extra projectiles. What do I want to play though? Not yet discovered. Stage two. Oh, the library.

36
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:20,779
Wait, so hold on. What should I do? This one? Can I do this? I can't do this one yet. Should I do

37
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:32,519
this one? The library? All right, let's go. See if I remember how to play this game. So all you do

38
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,240
for those who have no idea if those have never played, you literally walk around and the game

39
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,480
auto attacks enemies around you. And the game's harder and harder and harder. You get more and

40
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,800
more and more powerful and there's more and more and more enemies. It's so good. It's like one of

41
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,470
the best games ever made. Okay. So what do I want to do here? I probably, I like lightning

42
00:06:51,110 --> 00:07:00,439
strikes at random enemies. You level up every so often. Check this out. Boom. See that? That's

43
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,759
lightning level one. There's like eight ranks. I think of 10 ranks of every eye of every weapon.

44
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,920
The little gems I'm picking up on the ground. That is experience points. When it fills up at the top,

45
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,420
you probably can guess what happens. I go, all right, what do I want?

46
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,149
I got to, you guys got to help me out here. Cause this is once you get two weapons to maximum,

47
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:30,389
once you level up and you get two weapons that can combine into a super weapon, I kind of don't

48
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:36,069
fucking remember. I know lightning didn't have one. Does lightning have a, an upgrade now?

49
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:46,250
Does lightning have an upgrade? It does. All right. How do I do it? It tells you what you

50
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:53,750
need to evolve now. Really? It's wings. The duplicator. Okay. So I'm going to, I'll go whip.

51
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:06,310
I like whip. Duplicator evolves lightning. Hell yeah. Lightning is my favorite move.

52
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:14,649
I'm not pressing any buttons. Just doing it automatically. By the way, this game is like

53
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:31,860
fucking $3. $3. That's, this is an ad. I mean, honestly, this is, this game is amazing. It's

54
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,460
through the three bucks. What do you want me to say? All right. 8% more experience. I like that.

55
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:46,139
Yeah. I want more EXP. This is making me want to play it. I'm excited. You know what I did?

56
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,460
The thing about early access, cause this game is in early access. I was sitting here going,

57
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,059
Oh wow, this game's so good. But it was so early. And I did the thing where I said, you know what?

58
00:08:56,059 --> 00:09:02,379
I want to play it so bad. And this is like the last three or four months, but I just did not.

59
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,059
Cause I knew eventually, like right now I was going to get to a point where like, if there's

60
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:13,179
enough added, where there's way more for me to see. All right. So I already got bone. I'm

61
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,460
going to do bone level two last 0.2 seconds longer base area bite. Yeah. Let's go on level two.

62
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:30,360
Santa water is OP. It is, but I was that. Oh shit. Oh, okay. Don't be an idiot.

63
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:40,710
You do not die in one hit. You have health, but it's bad to get hit. Santa water has upgrade now.

64
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,039
I feel like I, did I play the one, the update that had the upgrade? I don't know.

65
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:55,340
The library is hard because it's not a whole lot of room to move around. There's a new enemy.

66
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:09,500
Do water and orb level two. Yeah. Yeah. I want more whip. Let's go. Whip is what? Whip is to

67
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:23,259
get the super whip. Whip and heart. Yeah. Okay. Hollow heart. Okay. Lightning again.

68
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:36,019
Do you say, do wings do anything? XP is early is good too. Yeah, but I want lightning. Let's go.

69
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:53,690
No, XP. Let's do it. So as time goes on, the game just gets harder. So you can really kind of blow

70
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,809
up a whole run. If you build without like enough damage or without enough health or speed,

71
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:19,159
you can blow up an entire run. All right. Does bone have an upgrade? I don't think this bone

72
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:24,250
doesn't have an upgrade, does it? No, it didn't have them before either. I want lightning.

73
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:31,590
Oh shit. What is that? Oh, one of the mod just linked an evolution chart. You're the best.

74
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,629
Bone is bad. Is it? I kind of, I like this guy. Is this guy at the bottom tier?

75
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:52,250
I thought this guy was good. Oh, chat gave it to me. Oh, chat is absolutely pog. Yeah,

76
00:11:52,250 --> 00:12:00,120
bone bounces. I like, it can bounce off people. Can we go bone level three or do I get some

77
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:12,840
spinach? What do you think? I would say damage up and one more bone. Yeah, let's do that. That's

78
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:32,759
fucking pretty sick. Get the mouse off the screen by the way. Mortacio used to be the best character

79
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,909
in the game. Did they nerf this character? That one again. This thing's awesome. Did they give

80
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:42,789
an upgrade to this? Cause this thing's, this is incredible. This is the thing that bounces around

81
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,590
and goes through people. This thing's incredible, right? They did. All right. I want it. How do I do

82
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:56,629
it? I have no, I don't even know what this thing, how do I do it? Armor? I don't want to get screwed

83
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:02,309
up here though, because the thing is these are permanent. You can't take these off and you can

84
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:08,789
have six of each thing. There's six, there's a, see the top and the top left? The top is the weapon

85
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,629
slots and the bottom is the item slots. So you got to be careful. You don't screw it all up

86
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:22,100
because you, I can't pick anything else up. I'll do Rune Tracer. Yeah. Cause I want to see the

87
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:31,860
shit that I haven't seen. If I see armor, I'm getting it. God damn it. I'm, am I actually

88
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,500
going to stream like all fucking night? Yeah, probably. Yeah, let's go. I'm going to have to

89
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:47,429
take a break to eat something though. I would tell you right now, the stream is good. We're going to,

90
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:50,470
we're going to just kind of chill and just play this the fuck out of this for like the next,

91
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:57,100
at least three or four hours. So we're going to chill, just play, right? It's going to be fun.

92
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:12,299
I love this item. I just completed all my exams. Hell yeah. Hope you did good. This, you need this.

93
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:17,830
I, I need this because I'm terrible. Laurel sucks. I thought I, I'm, I'm awful at this game.

94
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:25,620
Let's, let's talk about what a chest does. Okay. So when you open a chest, it randomly,

95
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,340
depending on if you could get an Epic, a legendary, I don't know what it is yet.

96
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,779
It randomly upgrades one or two or three items that you have.

97
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:51,450
All right, cool. Yeah, that's good. I'll take it. That's good for me. You can get a legendary

98
00:14:51,450 --> 00:15:04,519
chest. That's five random upgrades. And oh my God, does it feel good? Whip. I'm telling you right

99
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:17,370
now, I, me and Holly, we just, we just sit on the couch and I would just be high with my mouth open

100
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:27,899
just like watching her play. I would literally be sitting there like this for like two straight

101
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:42,070
hours. I'm doing whip again as it should be like, Hey, do you want to play? No, I just want to watch

102
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:59,940
you. Oh, dinner. Does that mean help? All right. I got it. So I, so now here's what happens.

103
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:07,690
So this is random, right? So if I max out the armor and I max out the rune tracer,

104
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,690
I can combine them. This is going to be awesome. I can't wait. All right. Don't tell me what it

105
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:18,649
does because I don't want to know. All right. Now this is a run, so I can't fuck it up. Don't be an

106
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:28,789
idiot. Once you confirm that you have the two items that you need to at least do one or two major

107
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:41,289
upgrades, don't fuck it up. This is an auto battler, resident sleeper. No, you don't resident sleeper

108
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,529
vampire spires. I'm sorry. You just don't, you can't, you can't do that. This is like actually

109
00:16:45,529 --> 00:17:03,500
like, I think illegal. Nice whip upgrade. Okay. Do I just rush this or do I just let it go? What

110
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:15,190
I meant 10 minutes is where it gets crazy. Go with Santa water. If I get Santa water, that's it.

111
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,500
I don't have any other room for upgrades for, for weapons. So I need, if I do Santa water, so I have

112
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:32,329
the rune tracer. I need the heart container for the whip. So that's two. Okay. I'll have enough

113
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:42,059
room, right? Well, I have enough. I can't make the decision yet. I don't know. Only the weapon

114
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:54,650
needs to be max. Really? I thought it was both. Really? Fire wand. This is it. All right. We got

115
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,940
the hollow heart. So now I I'll be able to get the max whip soon, which is huge. The max, max whip

116
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:20,869
has life steal too, which is crazy. Okay. So we're going to do lightning orb, rune tracer,

117
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:33,029
and whip mega upgrades. And okay. Yeah, let's do it. Because that, if this is Santa orb, right?

118
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:44,250
Santa. Um, let me see. Let me make sure. Yeah, it is. All right. Let's do it. Around the 10 minute

119
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:56,619
mark is where this gets wild. What's the lore for the game? I actually don't know. We're gonna do

120
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:10,180
bone. It's like Castlevania. Kind of reminds me of Castlevania. Bone again. Another projectile for

121
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:26,950
bone. So am I on level two for the library? Oh, it's getting wild. Resident sleeper. No, I mean,

122
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:41,190
we're, we're just chilling out now, right? Like, okay, if I'm going to, that's like the, I need to

123
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,630
pretend like this is crazy. So you don't leave, right? Like, oh, it's getting real. It's getting

124
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,509
wild. It's getting crazy guys. Oh, whoa. It's getting wild out here. So, you know, like we're

125
00:19:51,509 --> 00:20:04,900
going to click the X. Oh, you don't want to miss this. No, I don't get. That thing explodes and I

126
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:19,160
might get hit. I need to wait. I haven't seen ruin tracer at all. Oh dude. It's getting wild.

127
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,890
Those things explode and they can kill you in like one hit. They really can. It's awful.

128
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:37,990
It's truly terrible. Oh, this is going to be awesome. Oh, it's getting wild. You see that?

129
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,910
Okay. Yep. I want the Santa water. Santa water drops a little like a little splashes.

130
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:56,779
There we go. Finally. What's the lightning upgrade? The ring, the duplicator. Okay. So

131
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:06,700
I don't want to take, I'll take the, uh, you kind of like the friend that's really interested in

132
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:16,740
the niche game. I mean that I don't know. Would you call this game niche right now? I feel like

133
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,750
this is like one of the most popular games on steam. I feel like this game is like wildly,

134
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:34,250
wildly popular. So in that first screen, I know like most of you guys have already played this,

135
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,450
I've seen this a million times, but in that first screen where you can do the power-ups,

136
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,009
see the little blue area of effect that's kind of like twinkling. That's kind of on the ground.

137
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:47,640
That does damage when people walk on it. When you first do the, you look, you do the power-up

138
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,960
screen, you do area of effect, you do cooldown reduction, right? You kind of build the character

139
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:04,380
the way I'm sorry. I bumped it. What do I want to do first? Probably this one from what I remember

140
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,819
the Santa water at high levels is fucking crazy. And I'm not going to square anymore. Cause like,

141
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:17,660
what was the point of saying the F word? Good. I'll take it.

142
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:34,500
The F word. Oh fuck. This is a pro tip for you. If you see a health on the ground and you have full

143
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,900
health, don't touch it. You might need it later and things do not despawn. It's a little,

144
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:53,750
that's a little pro tip for you. All right. We're almost at 10 minutes is where it gets hard.

145
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,579
This is where it determines if you have the right build to continue going. And oh my God,

146
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,259
it's about to get really wild here. I actually stopped fucking around because I don't want to

147
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,259
lose at 10 minutes. The game says, okay, you've been playing for a little while. Let's see if you

148
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:15,400
can actually beat it. Let's see if you have like a build that's worth playing. I'm going to do whip

149
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:33,859
cause it's closest. Okay. This is going to be huge. Oh, should I just do spell binder for the

150
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:50,329
Santa water? So wild, crazy, hyper insane. Oh, I think I'm just doing Santa water. Spell binder

151
00:23:50,329 --> 00:24:10,920
also helps the bone. Yeah, I'm doing it. Spell binder again. You love to see that. That's awesome.

152
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,839
You love to see that happen. Okay. I'm going to do bone again, base damage, almost at the max bone.

153
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:32,779
Whoa. XP batches. All right. Bone is maximum. I cannot upgrade bone anymore. That's good. It's

154
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:41,460
going to be bouncing around and helping out. Oh, okay. Imagine, imagine, imagine bad chesting,

155
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:55,500
vampire survivors. What do you imagine? Bad chesting, vampire survivors. Who are you? Okay.

156
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:07,029
I want ruined tracer fires. Another projectile. I forget what this does.

157
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:28,299
Kills everything on the screen. Hell yeah. All right. Spell binder. Yeah. The red ones are worth

158
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:44,279
way more. All right. Am I missing any secondary item that I need? Wings is, um, no, cause I need

159
00:25:44,279 --> 00:26:00,619
the duplicator. So I can't do that. I just do what Santa water again. Come on. You should smoke weed

160
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:11,500
on stream. I'm not going to do that. Why? For what? Chest. Actually I probably shouldn't touch that

161
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,970
because when you get to a max, you need to open it in a chest. Has that changed or is that the same?

162
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:29,619
It's the same. Okay. All right. So I don't want to touch that yet until I have something that's max.

163
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:40,599
So I can open the, um, yeah, I'm not going to touch it. Look at that area. Look at that area.

164
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:57,980
It's gotten so much bigger. Oh, wait. Are you guys bad chesting? Cause I'm saying like, oh, wow,

165
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,579
this is so cool. Look at how cool this is. That's why you, that's why you're doing that. Right.

166
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:21,019
You said chest. Oh, please attract or begin. Cause I don't want to use the sec. I don't,

167
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:46,420
I only have one more slot, so I'm not using it. I need a duplicator. I love this game. Yeah,

168
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,500
I do too. It's great. Don't listen to all the bat chest haters out there. Okay.

169
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,089
They're all just making it up. You can't not like this game. I don't think it's possible.

170
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:07,539
Oh, that bat means chest usually. That means whatever. Fuck off.

171
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:24,549
Fuck it. I, it actually does though. If you, if you kill one of those highlighted bats,

172
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,990
there is a very high chance that it's going to drop a chest.

173
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:43,509
It's been a while since I've seen a lightning. Stop. I know. Stop. You're making me swear. All

174
00:28:43,509 --> 00:29:00,809
right. No one's wearing. I can't. Whatever. Dude, this isn't paper Mario. Wait, are you defending

175
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:08,279
the bat chesters or are you saying they shouldn't be doing it? Oh, all right. We're good. I got the

176
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:33,880
duplicator. Whip is going to be first, I think. So how long do I have to survive in the library now?

177
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:50,569
40 minutes at least 30 at least. Okay. I think I've done that or have I? Maybe I did 20.

178
00:29:51,210 --> 00:30:01,049
All right. There's, there's two chests here. I think I'm just going to get this one. No.

179
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:22,920
Yeah. Okay. Let's get it. Whatever. All right. Don't open the other one. I'm surprised as many

180
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:27,109
people don't like know what this is. Well, hopefully some of you guys that didn't know

181
00:30:27,109 --> 00:30:32,309
what this was, look at this and go, this is fucking hog champ. And I love it. There's a bat chest

182
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:53,619
right there. It'd take a while to kill. See, I told you. All right. There it is. I got whip level

183
00:30:53,619 --> 00:31:07,059
eight. Check this out. Bloody tear. Evolve whip can deal critical damage and absorbs HP. Take a

184
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:25,160
look at it now. Now this thing is insane. Play more of this? Oh yeah. I'm going to play in this

185
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:45,190
rest of the night. I mean, I will, I will accept you. I will accept you bat chesting Glover,

186
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,019
but I am not going to stand here and let you bat chest vampire survivors. You have any,

187
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:58,039
you don't even know what you're saying. It's like, it's crazy to me. Bat chesting Glover. Okay. Oh,

188
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:21,240
Glover and 64. Whoa. Oh, excuse me. All right. Lightning level six. Yep. I want to try to get

189
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:35,420
the lightning one. I wonder what it does. All right. Lightning level eight. Here we go. Let's

190
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:48,869
do it. What does it do? Thunder loop, evolved lightning ring, projectile strike twice. Oh shit.

191
00:32:48,869 --> 00:33:06,220
That's probably crazy. Whoa. Holy shit. All right. That was actually insane. All right. That's

192
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:39,769
actually insane. Don't pass over the duplicator. Um, I, I'm messing. This is a good run actually.

193
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:49,289
All right. Duplicator again. All right. What do we got here? Rune Tracer level six.

194
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:02,119
There's a good chance of winning this. Yeah. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Sometimes you just get

195
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:09,429
this dog shit and you just can't get something going. One more projectile base area by 20%.

196
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:17,769
Yep. Yeah. I win this one. This is going to be a win here. As long as I don't do anything like

197
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:31,960
boneheaded. What is that? Oh, okay. Level seven Santa water. Rune Tracer. Another projectile.

198
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:44,170
This one. Jesus. Okay. Rune Tracer is level eight. I'm ready to upgrade it. Oh my God. They're all

199
00:34:44,170 --> 00:35:10,010
level eight. Um, where's the chest? What does this one do now? No future evolved Rune Tracer

200
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:31,219
explodes when bouncing and in retaliation explodes. Oh my God. I don't, I think it's

201
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:48,150
impossible that I possible to lose. I got another one, right? Hell yeah. LeBora evolved Santa water

202
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:57,900
damaging zones, follow you and grow when they move. Okay. Time for the bit rate to shit the bed.

203
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:24,519
Don't have a funny title. Don't go. Somebody said, don't commentate the game. I don't care.

204
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,909
Okay. Wait, what? What do you want? It won't just be quiet.

205
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,010
All right. The title of the stream is not vampire survivors. And then in brackets,

206
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,170
long play, no commentary. Although maybe I should change it to that.

207
00:36:46,170 --> 00:37:02,889
Should I just change it to that? I have a joke. I'll do it. I'll do it for that person.

208
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:31,260
Okay. Here you go. Here's your joke.

209
00:37:31,260 --> 00:40:50,010
Fuck. For one second. Shut the fuck up.

210
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:46,199
Like people saying like mute your mic, mute mic, idiot. Like stop talking. Like I've built a

211
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:50,519
reputation of being the guy that just doesn't talk on stream. And everyone's like pissed when I do.

212
00:41:51,559 --> 00:42:11,980
And that would be a big controversy. That would be a huge controversy. If finally I just, I said

213
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:18,380
something and I'd be like, shut whatever. Like I sneezed once, like relax. And I lose like

214
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:23,719
fucking a thousand, like a thousand viewers or something. Lose like 10,000 viewers. That's not

215
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:50,199
what I'm here for. Voice revealed. Like stop talking. Stopped up. Like I did. I talked for

216
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:58,329
not even a second guys. Like relax. This game is so loud. Hold on. Is it really? Hold on. Let me fix

217
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:09,449
it. Is that better? I'm unstoppable right now. Your face cam quality is dog shit. What do you

218
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:37,670
want me to do? I don't, it's so hot in this room. I don't, I always take the money. Always.

219
00:43:50,840 --> 00:44:15,099
I'm, I'm just, I, this is amazing. I can't fall asleep to this. Here we go. More money. More.

220
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:48,389
Give me more. More money. Can we get a bit rate Pog face? Yeah. It's too quiet now. Holy shit.

221
00:44:48,389 --> 00:45:04,019
I forgot about this thing. This was actually a great start. This is a great start. I got to turn

222
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:31,539
on hyper mode next time. I'm going to do like hard mode. I'll try it. Face cam is too big.

223
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:07,860
It's still too big. No guys. I'm not muting my mic. No, I, I want to do some new content.

224
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:18,309
I'm not muting my mic. I want to do some new content. And I, you've, yeah, you know me over

225
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:23,349
the last five to 10 years as being the long play, no commentary and everything. But today I wanted

226
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:34,150
to, I just wanted to have you, I wanted to talk. Why is that such a big deal? I don't know. I don't

227
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:43,849
understand why. I want to change. I kind of have what I'm doing and not just do like no commentary.

228
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:46,250
If there's a lot of people there, I figured I could see if anyone's still like, can I hear

229
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:55,530
me talk and everything? If you don't like it, then just fucking leave. Okay. How's that sound?

230
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:03,500
I'm doing it. I want to, I'm taking my channel in a new direction. It's commentary. I know the title

231
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:25,539
says that, but I'll change the title. Rip 200 people. Why is it 200 people? I don't get it.

232
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:46,679
We made you. We made you. Do you know what I would want to do so bad? I would want to do a like long

233
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:51,960
play, no commentary video. And it's like six hours long and it's a game, but somewhere in the middle,

234
00:47:52,679 --> 00:48:00,840
just do this huge shitty mic quality burp. It's just like, what the? Holy shit. What was that?

235
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,949
It's just like a,

236
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:18,809
and that's it. And like, or like have it be like a plate of food, like metal onto ceramic.

237
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:27,429
He's eating a chicken parm or something, but he's not talking just once for like 10 minutes

238
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:48,730
in the middle. That'd be so weird. Yeah. You hear a lawnmower open up in the background. Yep.

239
00:49:02,489 --> 00:49:15,320
Oh my God. Wonder what it's going to be. Holy shit. Imagine getting this like 10 to 20 minutes ago.

240
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:33,300
I'll take the money. How can we look like a simulation? You can't do that in a simulation.

241
00:49:33,300 --> 00:50:04,300
Stop. Graphics have not gotten that far. Damn. All right. I'm almost at 30 minutes. I'm making

242
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:28,630
so much money. This is what space invaders look like to a three-year-old me. I could see that.

243
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:49,690
I'm going to puke if I keep watching. Why? Just turn your bit rate down. Turn off the damage

244
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:54,730
numbers so you can see better. I kind of like the damage numbers though. Like, well, not this late,

245
00:50:54,730 --> 00:51:19,260
but it helps to know like how much you're doing. I'm watching this at 160. All right. We'll go in

246
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:25,179
hard mode next time. I'm going to turn on hyper and I'm going to do first mode. See how crazy we can

247
00:51:25,179 --> 00:52:09,050
make it. All right. And I got one minute, one minute to get as much money as I can. I got to

248
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:13,639
get out of this area here. There's so much experience down there. I'm going for it.

249
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:54,980
I did it. I did it. All right. Oh, I get to revive right because of the thing I bought. Let's go.

250
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:15,130
Ooh, I unlocked Cavallo. Reach level 100 with unlocks reroll. Reach level 40. Unlock Dairy Plant.

251
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:25,340
Unlocks Banish. All right. I got a new character. Evolve the Ruin Tracer. You can see how much

252
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:30,550
damage things were doing. Looks like the bloody, bloody tear was doing a lot. All right. I got to

253
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:40,219
try Cavallo. This is pretty fun, man. This is a pretty fun game. All right. What's Cus Cavallo?

254
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:49,590
Gets more projectiles every 20 levels. And he starts with, what is that? He's functionally

255
00:53:49,590 --> 00:54:02,860
identical. What is this? What is this weapon? This is a new weapon. It's a cherry bomb. I'll try it.

256
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:09,059
That sounds cool. All right. So this guy, let me see. This is more projectiles every 20 levels.

257
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:14,889
So we want to do projectiles. So let's refund this here. So we're obviously going to do this

258
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:21,590
because one more projectile is just great off the bat. So if we're going to be based on projectiles,

259
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:37,539
I want to do projectile speed damage. I'll do move speed too. A little bit of Curse. Yeah,

260
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:53,590
cool down as well. Banish. Oh, these are new. These are new. Once per rank allows to remove

261
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:00,699
an item from level up choices for the rest of the run. So what? I can say I don't ever want

262
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:07,289
to see this again. Once per rank allows to get different choices when leveling up so I can

263
00:55:07,289 --> 00:55:18,489
reroll. That's a lot of money though. 11,000. This is kind of cheap, right? Reroll is stupid.

264
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:30,090
It's almost all the half the money I have though. Should I do Curse? Or should I wait to do Curse

265
00:55:30,090 --> 00:56:02,300
and do it later? I'll do 20%. I like that. I want luck too. Magnet maybe. Area. Yeah. Max Health.

266
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:13,780
Breed. All right. That's fine. Okay. So I'll try Cavallo. All right. This is a new weapon. Dairy

267
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:19,610
plant. The magic map hidden in here might finally lead us to a vampire or at least to more roast

268
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:42,179
chicken. Dairy. This is new. Am I standing up? Let's do it. So what is this move? So it is it.

269
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:47,510
Okay. It is. Whoa, it exploded. Why did it explode? They blow up. All right. That's cool.

270
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:57,719
Okay. I made the game 20% harder. Oh, garlic. Definitely garlic. No, no, I don't. I want

271
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:03,500
projectiles. This is not a projectile though. Santa water again probably. I like garlic. Let's do

272
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:09,429
garlic. I love garlic. So how garlic functions is see it just does this big zone around you.

273
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:14,820
I know this is not the build to do garlic but whatever. I like it. It's my favorite.

274
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:32,789
Is there a chest already? All right. Here we go. Projectiles. Do I want to do axe or knife?

275
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:45,130
Probably knife. I would say knife or Rune Tracer again. Yeah. Rune Tracer is just too good. Just

276
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:57,590
too good. Any wings? Is this technically a projectile? Because this is the bird fly around

277
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:04,920
you. You need to do two different birds. Is that a projectile or is that kind of something else?

278
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:18,139
Yes. Bird is a projectile. Okay. Bird is kind of hard to use early but late game it's stupid.

279
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:35,030
Oh, shit. All right. Is there a map hidden here instead? Should I go looking for it?

280
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,239
Holy shit. Thank God for garlic. Otherwise, I probably would have gotten killed.

281
00:58:47,960 --> 00:59:03,159
Oh, sorry. Killed. I probably would have gotten killed. More cherry bomb. Does cherry bomb have

282
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:16,619
an evolution? What's the cherry bomb evolution? No? Oh, shit. Okay. Well,

283
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:26,739
I'm going to do it. It's a great weapon though. It seems like it. It seems really good.

284
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:57,289
Chest. All right. Give me a legendary right now. Garlic. Legendary. Garlic again. That's actually

285
00:59:57,289 --> 01:00:05,159
awesome. He's ignoring us? No, I'm looking over here every like 15 seconds. For a great

286
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:10,820
germa, you should relaunch the stream at like 3000 up and see how crusty it is.

287
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:21,110
Didn't I do that one time? I remember back in like 2016 when I was first starting streaming.

288
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:35,320
Oh, definitely Bible. I remember playing like Overwatch at like 100k up. All right. I have to

289
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:42,360
get the other bird. I can't do anything else. No more new weapons. It has to be the other bird.

290
01:00:42,360 --> 01:01:07,289
Garlic. Bible. Tome. Speed. Equal. Yeah. All right. What do I need here? I need garlic in what?

291
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:23,940
Garlic in something else. Danish the garlic. I like garlic. Here we go. All right. So this is

292
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:31,659
Pumarola is the evolution for garlic. I'm going to get that. This is my first stream that I'm

293
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:46,059
watching. Really? What's up? How you doing? Welcome to the stream. First stream too? Really? There's

294
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:59,269
a lot of new viewers today. Where'd you come from? Where'd all you guys come from? Garlic again.

295
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:08,710
Garlic saves your life. It really does. I would have gotten hit probably three or four more times

296
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:26,900
already. I came from what? Gotta stay hydrated. It's a gaming sesh man. Gotta stay hydrated.

297
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,239
Blood looked like doom so I started watching and then this kept me here. Oh, cool. All right.

298
01:02:40,500 --> 01:03:02,730
There's the other bird. All right. Now we got to get the birds up. Watch out for this Minotaur.

299
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:16,119
Oh, he didn't drop anything? I just popped into the stream. I'm already considered buying it.

300
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:22,380
Yeah. I want to say I'm curious how many hours I have in this game.

301
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:33,860
I should just get the duplicator just because garlic and okay. It's just, it's like one of the

302
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:52,170
best items in the whole game. Of course I am. Nice. Here we go. Very good. I'll take it. Yeah. No

303
01:03:52,170 --> 01:04:08,199
reason to pass it up ever. How high is garlic level six or something? All right. The Bible is,

304
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:27,579
let me look at my cheat sheet. Bible and spell binder and then it's garlic and heart. I already

305
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:47,019
have it and then it's rune tracer and armor. Okay. So I need armor and I need, um, spell binder

306
01:04:51,690 --> 01:05:03,159
and then we're good to go for a while. I wonder if I should just get this too.

307
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:11,750
Will I have enough? I need one, two, three. I'll have enough. Yeah. I'm just going to get it.

308
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:20,150
Just damage, straight up damage is insane. I'm done doing it. That's going to be like 50% more

309
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:32,059
damage. What I was going to say is I've already played this game a lot. The really slow burn of

310
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:38,230
progression in this game is really, really, really fun. Unlocking each new thing and kind of getting

311
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:44,460
better and better and better and better. It's awesome. Okay. I can't do that. We'll do this.

312
01:05:44,460 --> 01:06:00,150
Yeah. Also crew ran X and chat made a lot of the pixel art for the game. Are they still here?

313
01:06:00,949 --> 01:06:27,320
Really? That's pretty awesome. Oh my God. I'm going to die. Okay. Definitely cherry bomb. No.

314
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:37,340
Yeah. Spinach. I'm not entirely confident. I think I screwed this up a little bit. It's all right.

315
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:44,139
All right. Here we go. Spell binder. Hell yeah. I can get the Bible now. Did I need wings for

316
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:54,219
anything? No, right? I don't think so. How come you're a sloth? Do you think I look like a sloth?

317
01:06:56,059 --> 01:07:04,340
I don't know. Oh, I thought you were talking about me and then like the camera in the top right. I

318
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,659
was like, I don't know. Do you think I look like a sloth? I kind of could see it for a second. That's

319
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:14,650
why I didn't say anything. I kind of like, I was like, yeah, I guess like I kind of, maybe I do a

320
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:30,969
little. I don't know. You're talking about that as a panda. I'll take it. Who can complain about

321
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:46,659
damage? Oh fuck. Okay. I need health. Is there health down here? I did make the game 20% harder.

322
01:07:47,460 --> 01:08:16,899
So I gotta be careful. Jesus. How far down is this? Where the hell is this thing? Did I even go all

323
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:29,000
the way down here? When did I come down here? This is so far away. I'm not touching that yet.

324
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:35,369
How far? What the hell? Oh, the title needs to change. Oh shit. I'm probably like dumping

325
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:42,659
viewers. I'm dumping fucking viewers right now. The title is still there. I forgot about the title.

326
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,930
People probably are coming and they're like, ah, am I dumping? Am I? Are people? No, I haven't lost

327
01:08:49,930 --> 01:09:27,510
that many. Hold on. I gotta change this. How about 160p is fine. Relax. That's better, right? I'm

328
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:38,229
leaving because you talked. All right. We got the upgrade. Let's go. Let's go. I need to minimize

329
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:53,260
this window, but I can't. I love the garlic and the Bible. It's just awesome. It's like the double

330
01:09:53,899 --> 01:10:09,529
rings. Hell yeah. You can play Kirby's Air Ride maybe. Hey, it was free. I'll take upgrades.

331
01:10:09,529 --> 01:11:11,270
Can you make the webcam 160p? I could try. I don't think I can. Let's find out. Yeah, I can.

332
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:42,229
There's no difference. This is at 160p. It's not that bad. It'll be worse. Why am I cross-eyed?

333
01:11:42,229 --> 01:12:06,649
Oh, it's because my eye is like drifting this way. Make your voice robotic? No. It doesn't

334
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:44,279
like movement, right? Doom guy? Can I change this back? Can I even change this back? What was it

335
01:12:44,279 --> 01:13:15,029
before? 720? Yeah, it was like, no, it was 1080, wasn't it? Yeah, it was 1080. Can I bring it back?

336
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:43,779
Where is it? What the fuck? What happened? What happened? That was weird. This is very weird.

337
01:13:43,779 --> 01:14:04,579
Why is it like this? I tried to make it. Okay, there we go. All right, we're back. That's fine.

338
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:10,060
All right, I gotta get back into this. Eye only. No, no, eye only. That's fucking stupid. That's

339
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:32,460
cringe. Are you cringe? Okay, you sure? No, you sure? Okay, there's no enemies here. Why did I

340
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:41,880
pick this up? That was stupid. You save that when there's too many things on the screen. You just

341
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:48,550
get a ton of exp really quick. I still don't know what's down here, but I don't remember being down

342
01:14:48,550 --> 01:15:02,819
here. The webcam looks worse. No, it doesn't. Okay, people said, you should get a better webcam. I

343
01:15:02,819 --> 01:15:11,529
don't want a better camera. You can see every inch of my ugly face if I had a very

344
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:21,750
expensive DSLR or something. No, no, thank you. No, thanks. You'd be able to see the nose hairs I

345
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:32,420
have. I don't know. I don't like that. I don't know. I don't want you to see that. I'm actually

346
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:54,810
confused. Where is this thing? I want this thing to die. Oh shit. Die already, please.

347
01:15:54,810 --> 01:16:20,859
Oh my god, die. Uh-oh. That's a good, I'll take it. All right, I need to break like a box or something

348
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:35,779
because I'm dead. Are there boxes? I know that this box is in the world, but where are they?

349
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:43,640
What do they look like on this map? What the fuck? I can't go that way.

350
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:55,369
Oh, there's like a, oh, it's a magic map. That's what it is. Permanently enables the map in the

351
01:16:55,369 --> 01:17:28,010
pause menu. What? What does this mean? What's that mean? I'm dead. Well, I got the unlockable.

352
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:34,710
I gotta beat it with a bear. Do it again. Do it again. Come on, come on, come on.

353
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:46,789
Let's go. All right, no fucking around. Let's go. I'm ready. Axe. Projectiles.

354
01:17:46,789 --> 01:18:10,180
This is Rick and Morty theme song. All right, no garlic. It didn't help us. Knife.

355
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:30,300
I'm not making a stupid joke. That's what it just sounded like. How many seasons do you think Rick

356
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,140
and Morty is going to go before they cancel it? Or do you think they will cancel it? Do you think

357
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:56,489
it'll go as long as like the Simpsons? Maybe one or two more? What is it out now? Season five?

358
01:18:56,489 --> 01:19:11,979
I bet you it goes to season seven. The merch alone makes adults swim millions. Yeah.

359
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:37,399
Hell yeah. I got the bracers. Let's go. All right. I'm kind of getting shit on here.

360
01:19:51,590 --> 01:20:12,869
Ooh, that actually worked really well. Fuck. Knife. I need damage now.

361
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:33,180
Surprise this is a dead run. I need damage now. This is a dead run. You picked up the worst item

362
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:54,840
in the game? Uh, ba ba ba. That's all I hear. You just picked up the worst item in the game.

363
01:20:54,840 --> 01:21:21,829
What item? The knife? It's a challenge run, dude. Do the barrels open? Oh, Jesus. No! Fuck. I'm dead.

364
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:37,479
This place is hard. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.

365
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:43,529
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it right now. Let's go. That's it. No more bullshit. No more

366
01:21:43,529 --> 01:22:00,380
bullshit. Fire. The lamp post of the drop items. Thank you so much. I've never would have guessed

367
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:10,979
it. It's okay. I don't like this level. Everything looks like it's on the same plane, but like I

368
01:22:10,979 --> 01:22:18,680
can't move over this. It's hard to tell. It's like that in a lot of places. Pentagram erases

369
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:45,210
everything in sight. It's Ruin Tracer. Every time. Especially now that they can be upgraded.

370
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:57,979
Put a webcam on the character. How am I going to be able to do that? Yeah, Santa water is amazing.

371
01:22:57,979 --> 01:23:10,300
check the map I'm so confused so what I could try the items that I can go get or

372
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:31,399
something so I need this for the Santa water pop left you can go over the item

373
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:38,029
cap if you get the items in the map really so should I not pick this up

374
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:56,409
they're far away oh fire want to move your webcam away from the level display

375
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:15,859
yeah that's a good idea there we go all right this is not a bad start

376
01:24:15,859 --> 01:25:03,180
could be better yeah my ass hurts fuck oh god all right I need more damage you

377
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:08,529
know man the curse really does make the game so much harder because they're

378
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:43,939
faster than me 20% damn it fuck come on something good that's our it's not bad

379
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:56,829
because that's 20% more damage oh shit this is bad really bad dude fuck you

380
01:25:56,829 --> 01:26:09,890
fuck okay okay okay I gotta go dude how am I supposed to get through that what

381
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:21,180
the fuck I'm dead no way no fucking way no way all right I gotta take the curse

382
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:55,300
off this level is fucking hard yeah I know no way not here speed area oh wait

383
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:59,420
do the expensive upgrades first right so what's the most expensive probably this

384
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:10,020
one and then this one and then I want the damage it's just so good

385
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:16,510
cool down is amazing speed is amazing I need movement speed all right now what

386
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:31,670
do I want growth recovery is good too yeah because that's that's a pretty

387
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:47,100
decent amount max health and growth growth and area and okay all right can I

388
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:56,729
do anything else agreed okay all right this is fine maybe I should have tried a

389
01:27:56,729 --> 01:28:06,979
different character I like the starting with the lightning it's great permanent

390
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:15,750
plus 30% area starts with temporary cooldown bonus 30% area 10% more

391
01:28:15,789 --> 01:28:23,729
experience every five levels that's huge permanent plus 40% duration and speed

392
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:32,409
this guy's so low as shit though maybe I could probably still do it on the bear I

393
01:28:32,409 --> 01:28:36,939
have to do I have to beat it on the bear don't I yeah let's try it again all right

394
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:40,779

431
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:19,060
right that's right that's not I did that wasn't a typo $3 but the amount that it

432
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:26,060
costs for you to buy three hash browns from McDonald's will get you this game

433
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:36,229

gonna be a garlic carry anyways really go all right give me another legendary

437
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:55,399
garlic legendary why would you buy less than three hash browns when the

438
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:58,600
McDonald's breakfast is it's just one of those things where you completely

439
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:03,170
forget it exists until for some reason you just up at like six o'clock in the

440
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:15,729
morning you're like y'all that's what we're doing right now McDonald's is so

441
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:19,390
ridiculous I mean other places do this too but McDonald's just has two

442
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:27,220
completely different operating menus it's crazy the McDonald's breakfast menu

443
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:32,899
it's just like it's a completely different restaurant and some could

444
01:38:32,899 --> 01:38:41,739
argue it's okay this is not on quiet it's not you me all right we're good

445
01:38:41,739 --> 01:38:48,449
it's so expensive is the breakfast stuff more expensive than okay it's like a

446
01:38:48,449 --> 01:38:52,810
double cheeseburger from McDonald's more expensive than and a sausage egg

447
01:38:52,810 --> 01:39:08,510
McMuffin are they the same McMuffin is more is it really it's about the same I

448
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:13,770
wonder why maybe see ingredients cuz don't doesn't McDonald's use real

449
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:18,409
cracked eggs like a real egg that they like they have to actually crack it in

450
01:39:18,409 --> 01:39:28,590
the morning right no they don't they do yeah they do it's only for some of the

451
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:33,189
stuff yeah but for like a sausage egg McMuffin has like a they crack it into

452
01:39:33,189 --> 01:39:41,340
a little thing and cook it in there I'm almost certain they do god damn I'm

453
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:49,659
sorry I keep punching you they do yeah they have real and they have fake yeah

454
01:39:49,659 --> 01:39:53,979
that's what I mean like it's some of the items have like actually somebody

455
01:39:53,979 --> 01:40:06,300
actually crack the egg and cook it you guys ever just get in the mood

456
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:12,539
where you just want to crack like three eggs in a pan and just like flip them up

457
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:21,289
over easy and just eat each egg in one bite does anybody else do that I take

458
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:27,810
each egg and I go scoop it up I fold it in my mouth mmm and I eat the whole egg

459
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:31,050
in one bite and just kind of let it just kind of mush it around and eat it it's

460
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:39,520
so good I love doing that I love it cuz I'm I don't like when the yoke breaks

461
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:44,930
and gets all over everything else I'm not I don't like that if I have eggs on

462
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:47,970
a plate let's say if I go to a breakfast place or if I'm gonna have eggs in the

463
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:57,060
morning or something those eggs are being eaten in one bite why are you a

464
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:11,270
snake no but I get that energy I mean it you don't you know I'm not talking

465
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:23,140
about like you like no you pick it up and you like fold it up and you let you

466
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:38,720
eat it I don't like when the yoke breaks and gets all over everything else I like

467
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:44,079
enjoying an over easy egg completely on its own with the yoke and the white at

468
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:58,399
the same time now there is an exception right if you eat sort of around the yoke

469
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:04,619
you don't break it I do that too so you'll get the egg white kind of around

470
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:11,520
the middle can't go that way I'll eat I'll eat that and then you just take the

471
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,680
whole yoke that has a little bit of the whites surrounding it you eat the whole

472
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:20,819
thing in one bite how do you guys eat your eggs you let me guess you guys like

473
01:42:20,859 --> 01:42:25,260
cut cut cut cut spread spread spread and then it touches all your other food and

474
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:33,779
then after about five minutes you have this cold yoke this cold gooey liquid

475
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:54,510
all over all your other shit yuck omelets are better omelets are amazing

476
01:42:54,510 --> 01:43:07,520
those are incredible the yoke is like extra sauce yeah I would feel that way

477
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:13,840
if it didn't turn it okay yoke when it's broken after a few minutes changes

478
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:20,640
it turns into this half kind of solid congealed liquid but not liquid sometimes

479
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:30,770
it like heart I don't know mmm hard-boiled eggs are amazing but you

480
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:36,319
have to eat them right when you make them I would still eat hard but we

481
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:40,069
already went over the hard-boiled egg stuff right hold on I don't want to die

482
01:43:40,069 --> 01:43:49,729
how have I not gotten anything to upgrade these yet that's kind of insane

483
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:57,619
deviled eggs are amazing deviled eggs can be incredible but they gotta be

484
01:43:57,619 --> 01:44:05,029
fresh I'll be the first person in line when the deviled eggs come out I'll be

485
01:44:05,029 --> 01:44:08,529
the last person in line when they've been out for more than five to ten

486
01:44:08,529 --> 01:44:15,819
minutes like after a deviled egg has been out for like 20 minutes nope we've

487
01:44:15,819 --> 01:44:30,939
been over this already yeah but there's new people here so much experience here

01:57:34,760 --> 01:58:02,079
clearing that fast like I was on the first run give me that it's your stream

543
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:06,159
you should go as long as you want yeah oh yeah no I'm good I'll be good for a

544
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,970
little while I told you this is this is we're just winding down here this is the

545
01:58:09,970 --> 01:58:16,619
chill part of the screen see we had three different streams today we had

546
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:23,260
like the kind of wild first two or three hours with that scary game then we had

547
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:27,939
the middle gamer moments where I was playing the FPS gaming and now we're in

548
01:58:27,939 --> 01:58:31,619
the chill mode we don't talk about Glover that didn't happen

549
01:58:31,619 --> 01:59:09,770
ooh I definitely want that that's gonna kill everything in one hit pick up all

550
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:18,159
the stuff hurry that first run was seriously so good that's exactly what

551
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:35,930
you want to have happen every time this one's not bad though luck I don't

552
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:40,060
understand what's happening uh I'm walking around and things are dying

553
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:49,979
that's pretty much all you really need to know all right eight minutes can I do

554
01:59:49,979 --> 02:00:03,229
it how far how close am I my still that far away I think I'm gonna be here for a

555
02:00:03,229 --> 02:00:20,539
while fire wand again just walk in a circle

556
02:00:20,539 --> 02:00:29,560
fire wand again base damage up what is the fire it turns into like a meteor or

557
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:49,279
something right one more and I need a chest there's no Glover footage to

558
02:00:49,279 --> 02:01:04,300
upload what do you mean all right there it is and what do you know just right

559
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:15,579
here it's like a meteor hellfire passes through enemies evolved fire one right

560
02:01:15,579 --> 02:01:20,109
this thing's really deadly if I remember y'all yeah this thing's insane all right

561
02:01:20,109 --> 02:01:23,869
I'm good to go I should get to 30 minutes because I don't think there's a

562
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:49,409
world where I don't almost maxed out here and then it's just get money hey

563
02:01:49,409 --> 02:01:58,770
what's a bluffer I don't go too far there's no reason to go far because I

564
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:03,500
won't I'll miss out on money you just want to at this stage if you got a

565
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:07,020
really insane building you can't even do anything else just stand in the middle

566
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:16,000
and just collect money this is pretty much a locked in when I think I could

567
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:25,000
try to go get the question mark but I think I feel like I'm too far could I

568
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:37,260
you think I could I get there in time you think I'll make it it might be too

569
02:02:37,260 --> 02:03:10,949
far I'll try kind of just southeast maybe I can't make it five minutes yeah

570
02:03:10,949 --> 02:03:25,220
I'll get it turn on map guides guide guides show guides what oh that's

571
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:32,569
interesting okay I gotta be careful this is I could die really quickly if I'm not

572
02:03:32,569 --> 02:03:55,750
okay hold on stop moving is it a key I wonder what that is good even though I'm

573
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:59,550
really powerful you still if I lose the Laurel you die in one second to these

574
02:03:59,550 --> 02:04:05,710
enemies if they touch you you'd lose 30 40 percent per second you can die very

575
02:04:05,710 --> 02:04:17,119
easily right now I have the two yeah right I have to revive to you right I

576
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:37,680
shouldn't be all that concerned Jesus how close am I now all right I'm almost

597

601
02:09:21,329 --> 02:09:41,689
points yeah master hand glove is cartoon white glove okay hyper dairy plant

602
02:09:41,689 --> 02:10:00,979
popiah and gallo tower very cool make a glove pizza hamburger helper glove is

603
02:10:00,979 --> 02:10:06,989
white cartoon glove it's Glover Mickey Mouse hamburger helper they're all the

604
02:10:08,829 --> 02:10:13,989
same yeah Glover counts as a cartoon glove what is it at right now okay so it

605
02:10:13,989 --> 02:10:28,909
looks like cartoon white glove survive ten minutes with okay all right what is

606
02:10:28,909 --> 02:10:46,500
a popiah gains 1% duration every level what does that mean what does this move

607
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:54,189
the duration of her weapon effect ah there's no maximum that seems kind of

608
02:10:54,189 --> 02:11:03,609
insane holy water Bibles bones really so I should do even more duration then okay

609
02:11:03,609 --> 02:11:17,420
duration 30% more duration more area projectile I definitely want luck pull

610
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:39,420
down speed all right it looks like it's gonna be a cartoon white glove now

611
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:49,529
that's way too much on this again I want try even get the duplicate yeah I guess

612
02:11:49,529 --> 02:12:17,859
so what else do I even want growth is so important moving speed good 4,000

613
02:12:17,859 --> 02:12:31,260
advantage is cheap I was just take it I think that's good all right so we're

614
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:39,779
looking for duration stuff duration so yeah what is this I'm interested what

615
02:12:39,779 --> 02:12:49,380
this move is gallo tower I'll try gallo tower yeah so I eat eat a cartoon white

616
02:12:49,380 --> 02:13:04,119

618
02:13:12,890 --> 02:13:34,600
points this time wait what none of these have a duration axe maybe or whip mmm

619
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:46,800
cross is good this weapon is awesome though all right duration is the ebony

620
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:53,699
wings is that duration I think it is right all right this time don't screw

621
02:13:53,699 --> 02:14:02,500
this up and get the other bird this is a really this is really small area as it

622
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:11,539
just vertical it's a great character to take here gets the vertical cross again

623
02:14:11,539 --> 02:14:33,819
song of mana base area up a hundred percent this thing is like s-tier this

624
02:14:33,819 --> 02:14:45,340

629
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:43,739
I got both the birds this character is awesome this is probably the best

630
02:15:43,739 --> 02:15:49,289
character in the game cool down I think I want cool down what is cool down scale

631
02:15:49,289 --> 02:16:01,939
with magic wand all right so I should probably get magic one the last one

632
02:16:01,939 --> 02:16:07,699
right where's it no sorry is it rune tracer I thought it was magic one magic

633
02:16:07,699 --> 02:16:18,350
wand is bad but it's okay the wand sucks don't even get it I definitely want this

634
02:16:18,350 --> 02:16:36,729
do not get magic one magic wand eventually turns into a machine gun

635
02:16:37,020 --> 02:16:44,129
it doesn't stop right there's rune tracer do I want that as my last lot

636
02:16:44,129 --> 02:16:53,850
though because I can't I guess I could yeah duration it lasts a lot longer yeah

it's too good I still have a few slots I have options all right well there's the

725
02:41:14,489 --> 02:41:30,639
axe do I even do I get the axe though I don't know what to do mm-hmm I have to

726
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:43,950
get something up because we're getting a ten minutes here yeah this would be the

727
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:53,600
last run to whatever happens here this is it I've got a win there we go I'll

stupid idiot I know it's a duplicator is always an instant grab but not right

730
02:42:30,030 --> 02:42:52,639
now I think I'm all right without it is there another item up top that's a quest

731
02:42:52,639 --> 02:43:06,690
item tracer there is I mean it's so far away there's no way I'm getting at this

732
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:44,639
run that's a new enemy I don't know hang out here damn it if you 10 minutes to

733
02:43:44,639 --> 02:43:51,940

734
02:43:51,940 --> 02:43:56,670
stuff that I yeah let's go back up there's a lot of items and stuff that I

737
02:44:54,860 --> 02:44:58,299
it's just a vertical map I'm kind of just going into the bright and left

even actually get the upgrade right now for one of them whatever it is it's

741
02:46:04,120 --> 02:46:17,540

six all right no I'm almost there all that that's five items I don't have to

ridiculous display I've ever seen out of all the time I played this game I'm not

766
02:54:33,319 --> 02:54:37,739
sure I've seen something like this it's kind of kind of can't see what's

767
02:54:37,739 --> 02:54:53,229
happening ten ten more minutes of this something's hitting me oh my god all

circular motions we'll get up there eventually okay let's go is there a

770
02:55:46,840 --> 02:56:04,379

02:56:04,379 --> 02:56:17,079
on am I there is a chest right here this is an AI generated image all right I got

772
02:56:17,079 --> 02:56:28,600
the super bird this is where it gets crazy it shoots like the yeah I got ten

773
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:35,280
minutes to go walking a story line up everything's maxed out completely maxed

774
02:56:35,280 --> 02:57:00,209
out what's all that all those cards one more weapon oh my goodness you're right

775
02:57:00,209 --> 02:57:03,569
what should I try to get I forgot when they combine it you get another one back

776
02:57:03,569 --> 02:57:18,829
what should I try to do pentagram oh that's right you can keep leveling this

777
02:57:18,829 --> 02:57:32,739
thing up we'll do that for now pentagram should I do pentagram I feel

778
02:57:32,739 --> 02:57:42,090
like this is the kind of ramps up didn't I banish the pentagram at the very

779
02:57:42,129 --> 02:57:54,569
beginning I could do the axe because I have the evolve right all pentagrams do

780
02:57:54,569 --> 02:57:59,750
I have the thing that requires the pentagram to evolve what do you need for

781
02:57:59,750 --> 02:58:12,440
it I do all right now if it shows up I'll get it I never done that before no

782
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:56,319
no pentagram oh my god I can't see any help guys hey what's happening I'm

783
02:58:56,319 --> 02:59:16,860
fucking dead huh what was going on I couldn't see what was happening I have

784
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:27,040
to dodge the mortis yeah I what I could I could see the exclamation point but I

785
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:36,530
didn't I don't know where the circle is do my screen is like I can't fucking see

786
02:59:36,530 --> 02:59:46,620
anything what the fuck wings are necessary on this map because what the

787
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:59,719
hell was that oh my god I was trying to talk I could see the exclamation points

788
02:59:59,719 --> 03:00:03,780
I'm assuming that there's like a circle around it and I'm trying to move around

789
03:00:03,780 --> 03:00:18,149
and get the fuck out of the way god damn it that was such a great run too oh

790
03:00:18,149 --> 03:00:30,719
that sucks oh come on really I didn't expect them to be that many it just they

791
03:00:30,719 --> 03:00:39,510
just kept happening I didn't know where to go all right that's it oh that's

792
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:45,879
suck what a shitty one to go out on I even have that I had the movement speed

793
03:00:45,879 --> 03:01:12,639
shit all right one more one more now I know that happens maybe I should do here

794
03:01:12,639 --> 03:01:20,350
this is actually the last one for real there's no way I'm doing another one is

795
03:01:20,350 --> 03:01:34,569
that the for real the last one who do I play with should I do the same character

796
03:01:34,569 --> 03:01:49,049
I feel like I said I don't know stupid reporter what does hurry mode mean all

797
03:01:49,049 --> 03:01:59,440
right we're going up it's all about the area it's all about lightning ring yeah

798
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:11,860
see it's like I it's hard to tell Santa water we're doing all area area area

799
03:02:11,860 --> 03:02:23,309
area I'm going up I'm so salty with that one well now I know what they do it's

800
03:02:23,309 --> 03:02:28,389
like they go whoop and they land so the exclamation point happens and then it's

801
03:02:28,389 --> 03:02:33,110
like two it's like a full two seconds later it's like one two there and it

802
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:41,049
shows up see that I couldn't tell yeah you couldn't see anything and I'm taking

803
03:02:41,049 --> 03:02:45,530
Laurel and I know that's like a you know wow this dreamer is actually gonna take

804
03:02:45,530 --> 03:02:48,729
Laurel I want it and I need it I feel like it's a huge thing to have here I

805
03:02:48,729 --> 03:02:53,520
feel like it's very important especially when you don't know what you're getting

806
03:02:53,520 --> 03:03:06,120
hit by I'm taking it duration or it's just let's just rush these up as fast as

807
03:03:06,120 --> 03:03:24,479
I can look we're already at one minute Laurel has helped a ton yeah it really

808
03:03:24,479 --> 03:03:28,399
does especially when it gets leveled up because then you can take three four

809
03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:40,600
five hits in a row it's really really helpful I'm not concerned about damage

810
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:56,840
here I have lots of concentrated damage so I think I'll be fine that one was so

811
03:03:56,840 --> 03:04:37,489
cool though hey stop walking in circles it can't be I where do I get the thing

812
03:04:37,489 --> 03:05:51,069
that upgrades it more more again more Kylo Ren more more I can't I don't know

813
03:05:51,069 --> 03:05:58,489
why I just thought of the Voldemort Homer Simpson thing again that's been

814
03:05:58,489 --> 03:06:06,420
killing me I don't know why I've been thinking of it recently legendary chest

815
03:06:06,420 --> 03:06:21,739
writer stick around I'm not going anywhere until I get it up just in this

816
03:06:21,739 --> 03:06:45,889

818
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:45,549

819
03:07:45,549 --> 03:07:59,500
uh when I press the button yeah a little bit of sweet a little bit that might be

820
03:07:59,500 --> 03:08:05,000
the greatest thing to come out of that stream those guys was so funny they

821
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:11,260
really were that was such a great group but that was such a great group of guys

822
03:08:11,860 --> 03:09:03,079
yeah yeah let's go can I get a look at me okay if I don't do it this time then

823
03:09:03,079 --> 03:09:16,079
when the hell am I ever gonna do I just save so much time very nice everything I

824
03:09:16,079 --> 03:09:19,440

825
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:27,229

yep all right we're good yep I feel a little more confident in this one

830
03:10:40,610 --> 03:11:02,209
mainly because of the law of the Laurel I have trouble just stubborn this on the

831
03:11:02,209 --> 03:11:11,090
switch would be crazy no kind of be hard on the switch anything that small screen

832
03:11:11,090 --> 03:11:27,260

836
03:12:24,040 --> 03:12:46,260
whatever that is I'm almost there well oh my god this this is not the run then I

837
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:49,059

03:19:22,469 --> 03:19:25,430
level up like one more time right I'm gonna stick around here for a second

857
03:19:25,430 --> 03:19:37,120
one of the scientists let you out of the lab oh yeah let's go um well it was a

858
03:19:37,120 --> 03:19:43,200
hospital and it was when I was an infant I was born and then my mother and father

859
03:19:43,200 --> 03:19:52,250
took me home oh that was about when I was another day old how long are you in

860
03:19:52,250 --> 03:19:56,409
the hospital for when you're a baby uh I don't want any of these so I'm gonna

861
03:19:56,409 --> 03:20:23,010

armor I can get the ruin tracer yeah yeah and then I have that okay well

863
03:20:29,809 --> 03:20:35,719
ruin tracer it is or clover but I can't evolve anything with clover can I or is

864
03:20:35,719 --> 03:20:47,040
clover axe evolved garlic heals clover and cross okay what would be better

865
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:51,000
probably garlic then they I don't guard garlic I feel like would be great because

866
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:56,549
it will heal and it's like a huge area oh I banished the item for garlic I can't

867
