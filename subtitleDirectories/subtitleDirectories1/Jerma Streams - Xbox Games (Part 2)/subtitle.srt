1
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:32,170
So I'm looking at my phone and so I apparently never tweeted last night. I didn't tweet last

2
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,859
night. Yesterday. So I opened up my phone. This is the first time I've opened my phone.

3
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,280
And I'm pretty sure like the entire 24 hour period since yesterday.

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:49,100
And it's just Twitter is open with the tweet from yesterday. So I just have to delete a few lines

5
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,719
and I'm ready to go. Look at this. I'm just gonna write. Oh, it's at X. It's at PS1. I'm gonna write

6
00:00:57,719 --> 00:02:09,419
Xbox time. It's like already done for me. This is perfect. All right. Okay. How you doing? How are

7
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:23,379
you? So today we have the X, the original Xbox is set up, ready to go. I have been playing. Oh,

8
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,259
my mic cut out. Oh, whoops. That's because I'm delayed by like a full second. That's right.

9
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:38,620
So I'm on the original Xbox. It's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this is because

10
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,340
there are actually a lot of games that are not backwards compatible with the 360 or with any

11
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:53,180
of the newer consoles. So some of these kind of just got like lost forever. And I have,

12
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,960
I'd say half of the games that half of the Xbox are like that. They're still here at some here

13
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,629
that work on the 360, but we've got the original set up. Let's see how long it takes us to go

14
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:12,219
through the originals. So first up, which is kind of surprising that you can't really play

15
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:17,500
it anywhere. But I think it's on PC, but it's like a Windows. It's an old Windows game,

16
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:27,860
very old Windows game. So trying to get the old like Windows, what Windows 2000.

17
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:56,620
Okay. Sorry. So he's fake typing. No, I'm not. Why would I? I'm real typing. Why would I fake

18
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:12,009
type? No reason. Please see your evil face. No. But anyway, so what was the same? Okay.

19
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:17,129
So a lot of these old Xbox games cannot run on the 360. I have a 360,

20
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,209
but some of these don't work. So I've owned some of these games for four or five years.

21
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,089
They've been sitting on a shelf because it's like, oh, fuck. I can't play these on the 360.

22
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:30,970
I thought 360 was backwards compatible. Maybe one day I'll get an original Xbox somehow.

23
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:37,529
Maybe I'll do it. But here's that day today. We're there now. You are about to see

24
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,259
games that are no longer available. So that's a, that's not true. You could probably, I mean,

25
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,740
look, I know that this is going to be, somebody's going to be like, whoa, what about just get an

26
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,079
emulator? It's original hardware. I like original hardware because, I mean, yeah, emulators are

27
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:06,680
great, but there's this period of emulation where once you hit the PS2 and PS3 arrow, like that PS2

28
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:15,160
Xbox into PS3, a lot of games have a ton of problems on emulators. They're, they get messed

29
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,680
up. There's tons of bugs. There's graphical problems. You got to like, oh, no, no, no.

30
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,050
The problem is you need a different BIOS. I don't want to do all that. PS3 emulation is

31
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,250
actually pretty great now. I hope that's cool because it wasn't a few years ago when I, you

32
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,730
know, three, four years ago, but also I also, I don't know if the game is still available

33
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,019
and like, I, if I can play it on the original hardware, I'm going to, if it's not, then of,

34
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:46,649
and of course I have a different opinion, right? But we're, we're on original hardware today.

35
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:55,269
When are you going to play boom blocks? This dude is lawful neutral.

36
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:07,819
That's what you took out of that. Oh, he's lawful neutral. No, I'm not. Am I? What's that mean?

37
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:26,279
Lawful neutral Andy. No, I'm not, I'm not chaotic neutral. I'm not going to say that. I'm,

38
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:38,730
I'm really not even that chaotic. I'm really not. All right. Give me one more second. Uh,

39
00:06:38,730 --> 00:07:35,209
we're going to be wearing a turtleneck. Why would I be wearing a turtleneck right now? All right.

40
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,339
I'm going to get started. Let's go. It's time to play the matrix. That's the first game I've got.

41
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:45,620
It's enter the matrix. Weirdly enough, this game never got any, it's probably, honestly, a lot of

42
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:56,410
this is probably for licensing problems, right? You have to imagine that some of these did not

43
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:02,019
get ported to the newer consoles because of that. Why did somebody just write? Ha ha ha ha ha. Why

44
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:09,050
did you do that? Explain it. This game rules and I'm on original hardware. So this is, oh yeah,

45
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:16,889
baby. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. No more stalling. I'm ready to go. Can you do an agent

46
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:31,100
Smith impression? Mr. Anderson, it seems I am not the only spy. You are in deep trouble, Mr.

47
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:37,159
Anderson. Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. You know what was really cool about what just

48
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,480
happened right there? That was the same audio clip three times in a row. And I just did it

49
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,600
just from my mouth. That was fucking awesome. And I'm going to, I will die on that hill. That was

50
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,580
actually really interesting. What just happened that there was no difference in how I said all

51
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,980
three of those. It was perfect each time, the same exact audio clip. And it was me talking.

52
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,820
I win the argument by the way. It was no argument. All right, let's go. Let's go. I made sure this

53
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:11,110
was playing the whole time because I was so afraid of the screen burning it. This trailer

54
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,330
has been going on for, oh my goodness. It's got to be at least 20, 30 minutes at this point.

55
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:25,529
I've just been playing this. So I've had to sit here and listen to this a while. All right,

56
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:32,139
you guys ready? You said you weren't chaotic. What's chaotic about saying pretty good three

57
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:40,200
times in like a cool voice? I think that's pretty lawful neutral. That's, that's 100%

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,240
just neutral, right? Like I just said it perfectly. If I was chaotic, I would have said it differently

59
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:56,919
three different times. I win. All right, let's go. New game. I'm not playing on hard. All right,

60
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:03,190
we're doing the no save file. Let's go. That matrix save is good enough for me.

61
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,759
Your account do hacking. No, I'm not. I want to play. Why is this in 320p? Because I'm on

62
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:17,450
is the burn in from there from last night. No, but I am actually so paranoid about it.

63
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:27,590
Let me check. Hold on. If I turn this off. No, it's not there. Thankfully. All right, quiet.

64
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,049
This isn't a movie.

65
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:17,700
I haven't seen the move. I haven't seen the matrix hidden. All right, I, I saw the first

66
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:26,330
matrix. I saw the second matrix and then I didn't see the third one. Stop watching this.

67
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:35,850
It's part of the video game. That's fine. This is exclusive footage. What the fuck? Quiet. Stop

68
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,860
talking. Just got out of the post office. Is the drop still clean?

69
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:49,929
Naomi, this won't be easy. I'm not just watching the matrix. I swear that is what's my friend.

70
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,769
I knew him. He never used to drop before. He didn't trust him. Whatever's in that box costs

71
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:02,899
that he has his life in the lives of his crew. And I have a feeling if we don't get to it first,

72
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,220
it's going to cost us a whole lot more. So are you red or blue on this?

73
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:16,659
Yes. You know me, Naomi. It's not a choice. Wait, didn't, don't you already have to take the pill

74
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:22,259
to do this in the first place? Wait, I thought they already took the pill to be able to be in

75
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,179
this universe or something. I know how valued my opinion is on this ship. I won't bother to tell

76
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,820
you, but I think it's insane for you not to wait for a support team. And for the record,

77
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,220
when I cart your bodies back to Zion, I prefer cremation or the gardens. Sparks,

78
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:42,100
balls. No, because this is flipped. It's all both ways. Then can you shut up and hit the button?

79
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,059
Your wish captain. My captain is my keystroke colon double backslash execute command.

80
00:12:48,100 --> 00:13:14,230
Okay. Oh, okay. Pick. I'll pick ghost. Why do you do that? Do what? Check your guns.

81
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,389
I can turn it up. It's a program. They get loaded every time the exact same way.

82
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,549
Hume teaches us that no matter how many times you drop a stone and it falls to the floor,

83
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,590
you never know what will happen the next time you drop it. It might fall to the floor,

84
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,139
but then again, it might float to the ceiling. Past experience can never prove the future.

85
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:48,179
So, so you never know. Here we go. Cool. All right. It's time. I would doesn't matter how

86
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:52,100
many times that happens. It was scared the shit out of me every time post office closes. There's

87
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,460
a ton of heat in the area, but the package is still untouched. Box number is seven three one

88
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,340
two two two. Got it. And hey, can you ask ghost if he doesn't make it? Can I have his boots?

89
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,409
To me, it's kind of like when a plane lands, when you're just like, you know, I've flown planes

90
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:12,090
hundreds of times at this point, right? And the plane is like landing and it's just like,

91
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,500
okay, we're okay. Right? Like everybody kind of has that moment.

92
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,929
It doesn't matter how many times you fly a plane. It doesn't matter.

93
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:37,620
There's that one second moment where you're just like, and that's it. And that's it. And you're

94
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:49,210
fine. Save matrix. Yeah. Is it burnt in? No, it's not. No. Why did he just check? No, that's fine.

95
00:14:49,210 --> 00:15:00,220
All right. Let's do it. Xbox night. The instant messaging window below is where

96
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,899
me message will appear from your operator sparks. All right. What's what do I have to do?

97
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,240
I didn't get it. I thought I didn't get a tutorial. What the fuck is happening?

98
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:23,500
I don't know. I don't know how to play. All right. Where do I go?

99
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,200
New tip fighting multiple enemies. What? What do you mean tip? I didn't even tell me how to play.

100
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:53,529
All right. What do I do? All right. That way. How do I play? Okay. What was the mission? Okay.

101
00:15:53,529 --> 00:16:01,139
That's punch this combos. All right. Cool. You're supposed to read the manual and I don't have time

102
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:13,590
for that. I don't. Okay. I have gone to, how do I open doors? It's just, dude, just, just kicking

103
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:19,299
punch. Don't care who cares. Don't worry about anything else. Wait, press the action button to

104
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:29,539
activate switches. That's the telephone. This is blocked. Read the manual. There's no manual guys.

105
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:40,870
I don't have a manual. Oh, it's okay. That's locked. That's locked. Should I restart? Did I

106
00:16:40,870 --> 00:17:18,940
do something wrong? Why are you so violent? What does it say? Kick the doors open. Okay. What do

107
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:26,920
I do? Stop asking the question and play. What? Why am I doing this? Why am I asking you everything?

108
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:40,339
Just walk around and figure it out. What am I talking about? I didn't like that was in one ear.

109
00:17:54,839 --> 00:18:04,119
What did he say? Okay. Pause menu and select objective. Oh, here we go. First person mode.

110
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:09,559
You can view the environment from a first person. Press enter exit. First person to enter first

111
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,599
person. Enter exit first person again. What? What? I can't even read the sentence.

112
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,680
You can view the environment from a first person view for the eyes of your character.

113
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,039
Press enter exit first person to enter first person mode. Press enter exit first person again.

114
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:34,650
What button is that on the Xbox? They didn't tell me what button it is. I have X, Y, B, A,

115
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,660
left. Oh, first person mode. There it is. Sorry. First person exit enter.

116
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:53,210
Okay. You can punch. You can kick when running from agents to exit hand to hand combo. Either press

117
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:00,470
move away from the enemy. Press fire or press first. I need to see these controls. Multiple

118
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,509
enemies at once from nearby all angles. Tap movement. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I need the

119
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:16,250
con- there we go. Focus movement. Weapons menu. Pause weapon select. Target lock. Action. Where's

120
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:36,599
it? Okay. First person. Cool. All right. Let's go. What box was it? Second floor upstairs.

121
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,220
I found a way inside. Try the security door behind the clerk's desk.

122
00:19:44,220 --> 00:20:01,299
Okay. How does this run? I'm in. I'm going to watch this whole stream on the toilet.

123
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,710
Make sure you stand up every so often because your circulation is going to get all fucking up to me.

124
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:33,079
I'm in. Why did you tell me to come to this door if you're not going to open it?

125
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:42,839
Why did he do that? Did you hear a word he said? Yeah, he said go to the freight

126
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,000
station somewhere over in the freight area. I don't know. I thought he was going to open a door.

127
00:20:49,799 --> 00:21:03,640
Press fire to draw a weapon. Well, there is no bumper on the original Xbox.

128
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:26,920
What's fire? I don't have- I changed weapon, I thought. Wait, what's fire? Fire is-

129
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,579
What are these two weird buttons? What are these two weird buttons? What the hell are these?

130
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:42,900
Huh? There's- I- What are these two buttons? There's a white and black button? Holy shit,

131
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:54,660
I didn't know that. Look at this thing. There's two buttons here. I- They were invisible to me.

132
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:10,180
Why are you such a zoomer? I never had an Xbox. That's actually- I don't like pressing that all

133
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:18,599
the way down there. Stop. Put it away. That's so far away. This is the worst controller.

134
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:32,500
He has small hands? No, it's just- What is this? What a bad controller this is.

135
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:55,000
White and black were bumper equivalents. Really? Okay, well, what was that? Why are we in like this

136
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:10,299
split screen? How did I just do that? I don't know. This game is awesome. This is- What a fun game

137
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:16,980
this really is. How would this not- Why wouldn't they get the licensing figured out to get this

138
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:30,329
game on the 360 or something? What are they thinking? There's a PC version? Yeah, but PC

139
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:34,250
version, you have to jump through like 10 hoops to get it to run sometimes, especially on a new

140
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,450
computer. If it has like Windows 10, Windows 11, it's just like- You have to set up a virtual

141
00:23:39,450 --> 00:24:11,369
machine at some point. Yuck. I missed so many times, but whatever. The climb fence is moved

142
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:31,400
toward the fence and your character will begin to automatically climb it. Shoot him. Shoot him.

143
00:24:32,119 --> 00:25:00,420
Shoot him. What? I have no more ammo? Wait, these are- Okay, wait, these are-

144
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:11,430
What am I doing? What's the point of that? They just do that to that guy.

145
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:24,789
Dude, if you're in a full sprint like that, what do you do? Stop that. Stop doing that.

146
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:09,900
Special moves? Ow. Go over there and fight him. Go over and jump to him.

147
00:26:10,859 --> 00:27:01,500
Wait, there's weapons. Wall press? I'm all right. How do I wall press? Reload firearms. I don't know.

148
00:27:02,059 --> 00:28:15,750
Shoot around corners. How do I get out of this? Oh, I got him. This game is so fun. All right,

149
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:23,849
cool. This game's fun. Grenade.

150
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,279
Stay above the gas. The cops are sealing the doors. Where's Niobe? She's trying to find a way

151
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,920
into the building. You're flying solo. Stay above the gas and find a way out of it. Yeah.

152
00:28:42,339 --> 00:28:49,319
Stay above the gas and get out. How do I do that?

153
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:19,779
Where do I go? Stay above the gas? Wait, this room's not full of gas?

154
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:37,579
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

155
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,190
Oh, the gas is in here. All right. I was confused. I got confused. I got confused. It's fine.

156
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,289
First, I wasn't getting hit by the gas and then I was hit by the gas. I get it. I understand.

157
00:29:49,289 --> 00:30:40,710
It takes me a second. I was too busy making the dumb joke. I got it. Jesus. Whoa. Pretty sick.

158
00:30:49,849 --> 00:31:02,650
All right. Here's the help. Oh, I just punched him right in the throat.

159
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:20,220
Okay. Now I'm not messing around. All right. The gas is over here somewhere. Shoot him. What

160
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:47,130
are you doing? Just attack somebody. What are you doing? You need to wall run. Damn it. How

161
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:55,480
do I do that? Face an object such as a wall, then tap movement forward as if to walk into the wall.

162
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:02,779
Your character will turn their back and press up against the object. Okay. Wall press. Wall run.

163
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,380
Is this correct? When a wall press, strafe left and right or move left and right to move along

164
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:35,990
the object. Okay. Cool. All right. I get it. All right. Let's do it. Don't turn around and

165
00:32:35,990 --> 00:33:00,150
and go the wrong way. So the correct way is over there. Where am I going? I don't understand.

166
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,650
But I'm going to go out of this gas down here. Can I jump on this?

167
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:27,640
Need to use focus. Climb up the fence. Get up there. What are you doing? I don't get it.

168
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:38,420
Somebody said I hated this level when I was a kid. Where are these vents?

169
00:33:44,410 --> 00:34:08,630
What? I don't think this is correct. Go back. Go back. I don't want to. I don't want to do this

170
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,829
again. I really don't want to do this level again. I don't want to do it again. I really don't.

171
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:44,409
I just had three arms. Ow. Look for us. Skylight. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Get down. Get

172
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:53,059
down. Get down. Hey, get off the first person. You idiot. Skylight. Ah, holy shit. I made it.

173
00:34:53,059 --> 00:35:14,730
Okay, we're good. I have 2% health. Did I soft lock myself? I hope not. Is there health anywhere?

174
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:46,440
There's no health. I have to actually be stealthy. I didn't even fucking see me coming.

175
00:35:47,079 --> 00:36:31,500
I just shot myself in the face. Hey, wait, wait. What are you doing? Oh shit. Oh shit. That's

176
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,889
fucked. That would be the quickest way for you to die. This dude is fucked up.

177
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:47,769
I'm coming through the grate. No, you're not, man. You're not going to make it.

178
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:57,349
If I sit here long enough, it'll recharge. Just anger overtook this character. I'm going to get

179
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:07,980
through that chain link fence. I'm saying happy birthday. Okay, wait. I'm waiting until full health.

180
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:48,409
I'm not messing this up. Holy shit. I just destroyed that guy. That was awesome.

181
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:52,090
Health is recharging. I'm not going to be stupid. This game is hard.

182
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,940
Just run by. I can't hurt. I can't hit them. Wait, what about behind the energy drink container?

183
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:27,590
No, go. Just run. I'm good.

184
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,230
The 85th birthday.

185
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,510
There was once a jail or bank or something. I need some guidance.

186
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,309
Oh, there should be a control room located very close by.

187
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:01,369
Find it. Call me back when you get there. This dude can't hear me through the wall.

188
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:41,429
It's a window. It's soundproof. Die through glass. Oh, no way. How do I do that?

189
00:39:41,429 --> 00:40:23,590
Kick through glass windows by running. Okay. Make this fucking epic. What's with my health being so

190
00:40:24,309 --> 00:41:16,840
reduced? Nice. Shoot this guy. What are you doing? Your character will automatically duck under low

191
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:49,059
hanging. Okay. How do I crouch? Is there a crouch? Dude, stop kicking. I put too many inputs in.

192
00:41:49,059 --> 00:42:38,820
It's locked. Oh, hold on. Go. Can I talk? Is there a talk button? No, it's not talk.

193
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:52,309
I'm not going to do it. I need to power up the lobby elevator. There should be a switch somewhere

194
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:01,340
on the control panel. All right, guys. I had to come in and press the big button.

195
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:26,730
How's the audio? Is the audio still okay? You want to do a couple quick tests? Hello there.

196
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:44,250
My name is Jerma. Does it work? They say it's good, right? He just hit me right at the fault.

197
00:43:46,469 --> 00:44:11,800
What was that? He just went like that. Okay. The combos. Who made this game?

198
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:37,980
Who made this? What company made this? Shiny? Shiny Entertainment? Because this is pretty good

199
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:42,860
for thinking about how it holds up. This actually kind of holds up pretty well.

200
00:44:44,630 --> 00:45:02,150
This is fun. Wait, the Shiny Entertainment that made Earthworm Jim? Wait, Shiny Entertainment.

201
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:17,619
What? The devs that made Earthworm Jim made Enter the Matrix and MDK. You know what's crazy about MDK?

202
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:27,659
I remember that being on a demo disc way back in the day and I played that demo disc a million

203
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:45,849
times. I didn't even know what the game was. What happened to that guy? Yeah, there was level one

204
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:53,579
of MDK was on some old demo disc and I remember just playing it over and over. Those old demo

205
00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:02,679
discs were so awesome. Do you know how many times I played level one of Parappa the Rapper?

206
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:28,980
It had to have been hundreds of times. All right, let's go. Were they awesome sauce or just regular

207
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:41,659
awesome? Please do a demo disc night. I feel like it wouldn't hit as hard as it did back a long time

208
00:46:41,659 --> 00:47:08,739
ago. Do it, please. Oh, this is a long first level. I feel like I've been here this like

209
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:32,519
tutorial level. Where are they going? What? Let's go. You used to get them in magazines.

210
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:44,170
Yeah, you know, I might be just completely speaking totally completely out of line here,

211
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:50,760
but do video games really do anything kind of funny and fun like that anymore? Not funny,

212
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,519
but you know what I mean? Like, oh, looks like a little thing we're going to put in the box.

213
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:01,829
People don't really have a box, right? Like, oh, here's like a preview for and it was weird

214
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:05,909
because some wasn't it sometimes it'd be like two discs in the PlayStation one case.

215
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:20,260
It's like, oh, here's, by the way, here's like some weird DVD extras. Like, oh, cool. No, good

216
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:27,269
riddance. What? You don't want like some fun thing just to kind of browse around when you're

217
00:48:27,269 --> 00:48:42,360
just kind of bored one day? Why? What do you mean good riddance? That's DLC now. A special edition

218
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,699
of Halo 2 and 3 had extra discs. It was awesome with behind the scenes stuff. Hold on, I gotta

219
00:48:47,699 --> 00:49:03,269
pay attention for a second. I have an unbelievably brilliant idea and I don't want to tell anybody

220
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:08,840
because it's so good that I feel like somebody would steal it. I might just figure out how to

221
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:18,280
do it one day. It's actually like a 100 out of 100 on a point scale for like how cool this would be.

222
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:27,019
I wish people would do it. I can't tell you because somebody's going to hear this and you'll be on

223
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:30,780
Shark Tank in two weeks and I'll be like, that was my shit and I shouldn't have said it.

224
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:49,050
That's such a weird flex. I'm telling you, I have an unbelievable idea and it's so good. It's so

225
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:55,719
good. It makes me angry that nobody did it yet. It makes me fucking mad that nobody's done it yet

226
00:49:55,719 --> 00:50:06,980
and it's there's only two people on earth that know what this is. Ollie and Otto. I told Otto

227
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:28,179
very very detailed information about this. Otto is a spy. Dude, one time,

228
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:37,159
this is completely unrelated but it's just so stupid. One time, so I like, okay,

229
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,139
I don't want this to burn in. I have to do something. I have to like literally run in a

230
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:50,679
circle. It's so annoying that I have to do that. It's gonna be hard to talk. I don't care. Okay,

231
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:58,789
so I like to, it's a new hobby that I have. I'll tell you about my hobby. So I like to collect

232
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:04,789
at this point right now playing cards. I like cards, you know, like ace, king, queen, jack.

233
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:11,460
There's so many different decks. There's so many cool things to kind of find and, oh wow, this like

234
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,420
there's so many different artwork that you can collect. There's so many different kinds of styles

235
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,610
and it's fun. It's fun. They're not that expensive. It's just like, okay, cool.

236
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:26,460
You're a psycho. Yeah, some people collect coins. I like playing cards. Let him cook. Exactly. Let me

237
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:36,219
cook. So sometimes it's fun just to kind of play cards on the couch. It's like, you know, like

238
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:43,179
Polly's right here, I'm right here, and Otto is like asleep kind of on the couch over there,

239
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:52,579
like over here, like to the left, and we just deal Otto in and like we were playing poker.

240
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:58,969
It's just like, okay, like here you go. Here's your cards. Here's my cards. Here's Otto's cards.

241
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:04,230
And it got to a point where we just started laughing and we're just like, what are we doing?

242
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:09,829
Because it's like, oh, what do you got? Oh, no, no, I fold. Oh, this is what I got. And I look at

243
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:17,719
Otto's cards and I go, oh, Otto folds. He's just like lying on his side, just sleeping and snoring.

244
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:23,909
It's like he's not even participating. Why is he in? Why are we doing this? Like, oh, Otto folds.

245
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:35,130
Like, what was the point? This is that was that's cute. It's just for fun. I don't even care.

246
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:43,480
But anyways, this is fun. Like he's not giving like, oh, look, look, he's playing too. Isn't that

247
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:50,710
cute? Otto has no idea what the hell we're doing. He doesn't care at all. He's just asleep.

248
00:52:52,409 --> 00:53:06,179
You should let Otto win. You should ban Otto. He counts cards. But anyways, yes, I've been,

249
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:11,800
I've been, I like, I don't have that many. I probably have seven or eight decks total.

250
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:20,599
It's fine. Some people collect coins. Some people collect. Look, all right. You know what? Some

251
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:26,519
people collect cars. I don't, not going to do that. I'll take the, I'll take the cards. Did I say,

252
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:32,949
what did I just say? Did I say? No. Yes. Some people collect cards. Cars. Right. I ain't doing

253
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:48,760
that. Okay. Jump from behind cover. Cool. You, hey, whatever you want to collect, that's up to you.

254
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:56,550
Go ahead and collect whatever you want. If it's cars, if it's coins, if it's playing cards,

255
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:03,539
if it's video games, people, old video games, collecting old video games, who's Otto?

256
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:43,989
I don't, I hate, I turn this off. Turn the sound off. That's really cool. Oh my goodness.

257
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:51,829
Dude, how do you fucking win? Dude, how do you, how do you win? There's too many people.

258
00:54:52,789 --> 00:55:08,019
My God. Skill issue. People that don't have the context that Otto is a dog are confused.

259
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:18,099
Like there's just some guy, Otto, that's here. Oh, you know what? Otto folds. Just a guy lying

260
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:38,920
there. Otto is a dog. Otto is a, my Dachshund mix. Okay. Don't mess it up here. I'm just going to

261
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,880
hide. I'm going to hide in the corner. Just, yeah, that's the best way to do it. Wait,

262
00:55:43,880 --> 00:56:05,269
how long ago was this? This is so long ago. Why was there no checkpoint here? Why was there no

263
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:55,099
checkpoint? Skill issue. I'll show you a skill issue. Hey, rate this one. All right. Let's not

264
00:56:55,099 --> 00:57:13,289
mess this up, please. How did you choose Otto's name? Uh, that was Otto's name already. So Otto

265
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:20,010
was a rescue and he was already two or three years old and kind of already knew his name.

266
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:29,219
So it's just like, yeah, we'll just keep it that way. All right. Here we go.

267
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:49,800
Do it. Shoot him. I just got so angry. What the fuck? This level is so hard.

268
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:24,010
I just, you have focus, but I shot those guys like a thousand times. Oh, come on. No. What?

269
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:45,260
I, those guys weren't even, my eyes are so itchy. Okay. The whole game is difficult. It's very cheap

270
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:50,630
in the later levels. Oh, great. Well, it's a good thing we have a time limit on all of these games

271
00:58:50,630 --> 00:59:13,750
we play. I wish there was a checkpoint here. Spamming is the meta. Don't be afraid to spam.

272
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:18,710
So wait, I, it's not about looking cool. It's about just spamming as much as you possibly can.

273
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:24,809
Are you going to play Elmo's preschool? No, probably not. That game's way too hard.

274
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:28,809
Especially the last boss is just like fucking stupid.

275
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:39,690
The dodge mechanic in that game is so annoying when you're in like the,

276
00:59:39,690 --> 01:00:00,619
when you go to that, uh, like kind of, hold on. What the fuck? It's too hard.

277
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:10,099
It was just the underworld level is just like, I don't know. They give you like five health potions

278
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,900
and you can, they think you can beat that like Satan character with five, which is like, you,

279
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:19,539
it does, you, it's just, I don't know. You can only heal like a few times during that fight.

280
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:50,860
True. I don't know. It's all right. That's not bad. Don't do that anymore. Something is in my

281
01:00:50,860 --> 01:01:20,170
eye and it's causing me stress. Ow. No, you piece of shit. This game is impossible. Holy shit, dude.

282
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:31,510
This game is like not even beatable. Oh, excuse me. I don't understand. I, those guys were on

283
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:35,590
the ground dead and then they, all right. I'm, I'm not, I'm doing this for real this time.

284
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:39,190
I'm not going to talk about like, oh, Elmo has a funny game with like a dodge mechanic.

285
01:01:39,909 --> 01:02:58,760
Stop and play. You didn't see him blank and plain view. I want that health.

286
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:08,250
Actually, it'll read, it'll go up. Stop walking into bullets. Watch this clip. It's as, this is

287
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:19,429
as bad as singing the braids song. What braids song are you talking about? Why am I losing health?

288
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:36,579
Okay. I am going to try as hard as I can. I'm not going to talk. I'm not going to say a single

289
01:03:36,579 --> 01:05:07,510
sentence. I promise. Where are the enemies? What am I doing? What's happening? What am I doing?

290
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:41,989
All right. Go. Nice. Pick up that phone. That's just kind of scared me.

291
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:21,400
Yes. Thank God. Thank goodness. Did you play Peglin? I did not. I'm still in the first level.

292
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,539
What is coming out of that?

293
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:59,449
From the second floor. Sorry. That's a big ice maker. You can make it. It's money. Oh, it is money.

294
01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:07,860
That'd be so cool if there was a counter up in the top, right? That was like, like hundreds,

295
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:11,059
hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds.

296
01:07:11,059 --> 01:08:08,820
That guy almost just killed me. There's no side jump. There is. I mean, I can side jump out of the,

297
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:20,300
out of cover. I want to like side jump right now. I hope I'm going the right way because I have

298
01:08:20,300 --> 01:09:15,750
absolutely no idea where I'm going. See you. Okay. I think I got it. This game looks pretty sick.

299
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:24,329
The game is pretty sick. Can you wall run in real life? You know, I actually feel like I probably

300
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:28,699
can. You know, those things that you've never really tried that much before, but you're just

301
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:36,569
so confident that you could. I think I can. I could probably get at least one, two, three,

302
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:44,020
four, five steps or at least one, two, three, four. If I, if I was in full sprint and I was

303
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:58,970
like, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh. I could do at least four. Where these guys even come from?

304
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:10,020
Do it on the battle act stream. I, all right. That's fine. Well, I'm going to add more things

305
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:36,739
that I can prove that I can do. We'll get a list. I'll do them all. How did you shoot me more than

306
01:10:36,739 --> 01:11:33,319
I shot you? Oh, that's how you do that. Oh goodness. What did I just do? I just did a split in the air.

307
01:11:40,140 --> 01:12:34,869
That would be so scary. I have no bullets. Oh fuck. What are you doing? Oh, get out. What am I doing?

308
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:46,069
I don't know. I don't understand what to do. Am I, should I run? What? Am I missing something?

309
01:12:46,069 --> 01:13:29,029
Or do I have to fight? They can definitely see me. I kicked that guy through the glass.

310
01:13:29,029 --> 01:14:27,100
Dude, what the? I gotta climb this. No, I don't. It hurt me. Where do I go? You gotta eat. Dude,

311
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,579
they're just coming out of nowhere. They're actually spawning out of nowhere. I'm not,

312
01:14:29,579 --> 01:15:21,739
I have to go somewhere. Come on, man. That's the same. Is it the same model?

313
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,060
Something's burnt into the bottom left of the screen and I don't know what it is.

314
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:55,340
There is text burnt into the bottom left. What is it? Is it loading screen?

315
01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:19,380
I, is it select? No, it's loading. Yep. That is slowly being burnt into the screen.

316
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:37,159
How old is your capture card? Hold on. Something important just happened. What am I firing at?

317
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:55,930
It's inverted. Dude, this sucked. There's nobody to shoot. I could be inside the car right now.

318
01:16:56,649 --> 01:17:18,920
There's nobody to shoot. Oh, now there is. Unreal engine demo. This is so

319
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:35,819
fucking loud. I, can anybody even hear me? Why am I doing this? Dude, you know, I have to tell you

320
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:40,060
something. It's very important and I have to pause it for this because you can't hear me.

321
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:46,140
This reminds me of arcade games that are, you know, light gun arcade games. Can somebody explain to

322
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:53,979
me please? Tell me why. Explain to me. Why is every light gun game stuck in like 2003?

323
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:02,859
Every light gun game, they've, they're on the same technology, the same kind of graphics engines.

324
01:18:02,859 --> 01:18:12,100
Why are they all so kind of scuffed? Every game I've ever played at an arcade that,

325
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:22,020
it's never progressed past like 2003. No, they did not stop being made. There are new ones. There

326
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:27,300
are new ones that come out and I've played some of these new ones and they are terrible.

327
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:33,800
They are brand new games and you know what they do? This is what they do instead. Instead of

328
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,239
looking good and playing good, you go into this weird audio world where it's like,

329
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:45,640
we have subwoofers built in. So don't, don't, it's like, don't pay attention to the 25 FPS

330
01:18:46,279 --> 01:18:52,149
awful shooting game. They, they, they make these like weird sit in Disney kind of rides

331
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:57,770
where it's just like, oh, okay, I'm ready. It just shakes and screams at you, but the game's

332
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:13,510
terrible. What happened? Why are all these games just stuck in the same era? Is it hard? Is it

333
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:19,109
just, is it impossible to make a game that's got like 2015 graphics and plays well? Why are they

334
01:19:19,109 --> 01:19:30,380
all running like such shit too? Burn-in. All right, sorry. I'm so paranoid about the burn-in.

335
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:44,489
I thought the health 93% was burnt in. What if I just don't shoot anyone? I don't know if that was

336
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:54,890
scripted or not, but I would be dead. My head would have been crushed five times. I'm not

337
01:19:54,890 --> 01:20:20,500
shooting anybody. This guy sucks at driving. What is happening to the car? Oh my God. Wait,

338
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:30,840
wait, I, I, wait, I'm not, no, I'm not driving. Who's driving? I would be driving better than this.

339
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:47,109
This feels like I'm playing GTA online. This is exactly what it's like. Did the bridge just spawn?

340
01:20:47,989 --> 01:21:19,979
What was that? Why did the bridge just spawn? It's the matrix. Oh, it is the matrix. I'll tell you

341
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:25,579
something that has increased. You know, it has increased, not the quality of the light gun games,

342
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:49,020
but how much they cost to play. Interesting. Exit. Tell me it's close. It's close. The fire escape

343
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:54,539
on your left. Hurry. Does it make this phone on the roof? The phone is behind the roof access door.

344
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:57,340
Oh, thanks sparks. I couldn't have been on the ground floor.

345
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:26,390
She aimed that gun like she was casting a spell. Oh, here he is. Yeah. No pinball tables. It's

346
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:30,229
bullshit. You know what? There are a lot of places that are starting to kind of try to do the old

347
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:43,020
fashion arcade stuff. That's really cool. If I ever had an arcade, it would just be free pizza,

348
01:22:43,020 --> 01:23:00,060
but you had to be like playing. That's a casino. Nevermind. Free pizza. It's just like a waiter or

349
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,020
a waitress rocking around. Pizza. Anybody want some pizza? Oh yeah. I'll take a slice instead

350
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:17,479
of alcohol. I'm sorry, but that's fucking cool. That's, I would go there, but then the logistically

351
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:22,340
would be hard because people get greasy fingers all over the controls. Imagine somebody walking

352
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,739
around with like a piping hot pizza, walking around the like, I almost just said casino floor.

353
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:53,529
Imagine walking on the casino floor. Where's that? I just, I didn't know what like the constraints

354
01:23:53,529 --> 01:24:04,920
were of the video game. I actually didn't mean to do that one. Greasy controllers are given at an

355
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:14,279
arcade. They always have bar food. You know what? What's going on here? You come to my arcade. Okay.

356
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:21,260
As long as you're playing, you know you're playing. Hey, I'm having one like slice. How are you doing

357
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:27,579
over there? By the way, no toppings or no bullshit. No toppings. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse

358
01:24:27,579 --> 01:24:38,979
me. Oh yeah. Pepperoni and olives. No, no, no, no. This is cheese only by the way. What do you mean

359
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:47,130
fuck that? No toppings. You know how difficult it would be to actually logistically put that

360
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:56,140
together? Hold on a second. Oh, I had an opportunity. I just need to, I'm sorry everyone. I need to do

361
01:24:56,140 --> 01:25:10,170
this. This is for the video. This is for the video and three, two, one. This is for the video.

362
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:32,279
Let's go. It is I, Superman. It's going to be, I can see it. People can rewind and watch it rewind.

363
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:44,840
It's going to have a huge hump for replayed part of the video. Ladders. How do these work?

364
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:06,229
That place would be disgusting. They would just be, people would drop full cheese slices,

365
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:10,739
cheese side down on the ground. You know what I'm talking about? Just like, oh, thank you.

366
01:26:10,739 --> 01:26:17,819
They appreciate a full slice. Cheese like sauce, cheese side down on the ground.

367
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:28,460
This place would be a mess. You got bread side down. That's not a big deal. Cheese side down.

368
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:55,939
That's a carpet clean. Oh, yes. Cheese. I'm talking like with this, like cheese and sauce

369
01:26:55,939 --> 01:27:10,380
side down. Like if you dropped it on the ground, new tip impossibly fast, incredibly lethal

370
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:15,100
and fearless are hands down the deadliest enemies within the matrix. You can never completely kill

371
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:19,319
an agent. They'll just acquire another body that is plugged into the matrix. At best,

372
01:27:19,319 --> 01:27:32,649
you can temporarily defeat. All right. So it's like, you just can't kill them. I don't even

373
01:27:32,649 --> 01:27:43,020
know where, where am I going? Yeah. And you could not order a full pizza. It would just be a slice

374
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:52,859
of cheese is what you could get. Am I missing something here? I'm, that probably looked on

375
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:56,859
purpose and it kind of was, but I thought I could go, I don't know. I thought I could do Spider-Man

376
01:27:56,859 --> 01:28:01,340
on the wall. People are going to be pissed. I'm sorry. People are going to be pissed off now,

377
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:06,489
but that's going to make people angry. It's like, dude, just stop doing this. Not fucking funny.

378
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:22,840
I'm just trying to see what I can do in the game. What are you doing? So I need to go. Oh,

379
01:28:22,840 --> 01:29:14,789
there's a ladder right here. So now from, where do I go from here? This way over there. Climb

380
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:52,899
over the fence. You can jump a thousand feet in the air. Oh, oh shit. What were you, why were you

381
01:29:52,899 --> 01:30:08,170
two in here? What is in here? Why are they were just sitting in here? There's nothing here. What

382
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:58,439
is that? Just a big, is that just like a, what is it? What is it? Oh, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Anderson.

383
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:10,569
Okay. So just don't, just don't bite them. Oh my God. Okay. This actually sucks. I just gotta run.

384
01:31:10,569 --> 01:31:31,060
This sucks. It's so far back. Mr. Anderson, seven minutes. How many people in the chat even

385
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:48,869
understand what that was? Some of you do. Some of you, not very many. That is Albert Wesker,

386
01:31:48,869 --> 01:32:09,930
but why did I say that? Trivia, some channel trivia for people. Stop. Old video, dude. That's

387
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:36,380
right. No. Oh my fucking God. You've got to be, I, oh my God. I got caught on the lip and I didn't

388
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:53,460
jump. I got stuck and the character went like that and I couldn't stop doing that. I'm sorry.

389
01:32:54,460 --> 01:33:01,340
I'm not doing it on purpose. I am telling you, I'm promising you. I actually got, you think I

390
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,149
would be at the very end like that and do that? No, I got caught. You should change the game. I'm

391
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:12,140
kind of, I kind of like this. I'm giving this another 30, 20, 30 minutes. I, I get to, I'm going

392
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:18,739
to have the streamer reverse veto where I'm, I'm playing this like at least another 25 minutes,

393
01:33:18,739 --> 01:33:57,020
at least this is, I like this a lot. This is very fun. Okay. Come on. Don't screw it up. Okay. Now

394
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:25,140
I have to sit here. The health region. Okay. What is this? A little shortcut. What is this? I didn't

395
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:39,210
see this. What do I go? Where do I go? I fucking freaked out. I freaked out. I'm going to take the

396
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:46,569
disc out. I, I thought I had to jump over there. I don't, I don't, I can't fight them. Oh shit. I

397
01:34:46,569 --> 01:34:58,840
look so stupid. I look so dumb. I would, I, where do you go? It doesn't look like there's a, to the

398
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:10,550
right. Don't jump to him. What? Where am I supposed to go? I need to go left. I, that's what I tried

399
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:26,630
to do. You were at the right spot. I just missed the jump. This breakable wood. I, that, that's

400
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:40,729
what I saw. And I was like, can I jump into that or through that? I almost didn't make that jump.

401
01:36:21,560 --> 01:37:29,850
What? Stop. Oh shit. Is that him? Now where? Here. Oh, I pressed it and it didn't jump,

402
01:37:29,850 --> 01:38:04,229
but I made it. I'm fine. Oh, we got a cut scene. Perfect. Okay. You want a shot to feel good,

403
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:13,159
can fix you up. Right now, all I know is what's on that disc. Sir, we just received an emergency

404
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:18,439
broadcast from the Logos. She did it. Yes, sir. The last transmission of the Osiris.

405
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,359
This is Daddy's, captain of the Osiris. It is 1803 on 1214 and I fear this will be our last

406
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:30,039
transmission. Less than two hours ago, we were pinned between two search units near BZ 218.

407
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:33,640
We tried to outrun them on the surface when our sensors went completely berserk.

408
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:38,039
We didn't believe what our equipment was telling us until we ran smack into the middle of it.

409
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:45,159
An army, their army. It's massive. Hundreds of times the size of anything we fought.

410
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,720
We're under heavy pursuit and have sustained critical damage. We're going to attempt an

411
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:56,760
emergency broadcast drop in the matrix. After that, let's hope that somehow this disc reaches Zion.

412
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,199
And if it does, it's not too late. We had an opportunity.

413
01:39:02,649 --> 01:39:07,850
Drop down in Zion broadcast. I want this data transmitted immediately. Emergency encryption.

414
01:39:08,569 --> 01:39:13,130
What are you saying? Wife of Barty? Lieutenant. Yes, sir. Is the Logos still in contact?

415
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:16,970
Yes, sir. There's ants in your hair. Get me Captain Nyope.

416
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:24,090
Black feed from Zion. Jesus, it's deadbolt himself. Give me that.

417
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,899
Captain, you and your crew to be commended. What you have done may prove to be the turning

418
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:35,779
point in this war. Do you have a plan, Commander? Right now, I want every ship to return to Zion

419
01:39:35,779 --> 01:39:40,859
all as fast as humanly possible. I leave the recall hands kept.

420
01:39:40,859 --> 01:39:44,539
Yes, sir, Commander. It's all on one disc, by the way. That's pretty remarkable.

421
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:50,090
Nyope, please be careful. As careful as I can be.

422
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:58,680
That's just one disc. It was a DVD. The power of the DVD.

423
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:04,380
No, it's weird about the Xbox. When that first came out,

424
01:40:06,939 --> 01:40:10,779
that's why we're going to use the airport. All those different pay phones will make a trace

425
01:40:10,779 --> 01:40:14,539
impossible. We can split up and stay mobile. What could go wrong?

426
01:40:14,539 --> 01:40:44,250
I am calling to confirm that your order of Red Orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.

427
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:50,300
This is the Great Beyond Travel Agency. We will get back to you as soon as humanly possible.

428
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:55,340
I am calling to confirm that your order of Red Orchids will be delivered tomorrow by midnight.

429
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:58,380
Operator. Jax.

430
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:01,180
Nyope, is that you? I'm not sure I can talk right now, Jax.

431
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:06,060
Nyope, listen to me. They got Axel. Soren led everybody in after him. It's bad,

432
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,460
Where? The airport.

433
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:10,300
What? We're at the airport.

434
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,899
Please, you gotta help us.

435
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:15,979
Agents have cornered Soren. They're moving Axel to the tarmac. If they get him in the air...

436
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:22,810
What the hell happened? I thought you said be discreet.

437
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,970
It wasn't me. It's Soren.

438
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:28,250
Agents pinched one of his crew. Now they've come in and tried to rescue him.

439
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,210
You? Yeah.

440
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:31,130
What? Lucky for him, not so lucky for us.

441
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:32,649
It's Axel.

442
01:41:32,649 --> 01:41:33,689
Shit. What do you want to do?

443
01:41:33,689 --> 01:41:36,170
See if you can help Soren. I'll go after Axel.

444
01:41:36,170 --> 01:41:37,050
Well, good luck.

445
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,649
I'm certainly due for something.

446
01:41:38,649 --> 01:41:53,720
I have no idea what just happened. Okay.

447
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:58,699
Okay, stay calm. Help is on its way.

448
01:41:58,699 --> 01:42:01,340
How many of them were there? I swear I got them.

449
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:02,539
Did you see any of them?

450
01:42:02,539 --> 01:42:03,819
He was right in my sights.

451
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,619
Why did I... No, put this down.

452
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:07,659
Emergency evacuation.

453
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:08,699
Can I... How can I...

454
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:12,060
They're just gonna lie down and get scanned by the machine.

455
01:42:18,939 --> 01:42:20,380
I didn't even go through security.

456
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,779
What? What... I don't...

457
01:42:25,819 --> 01:42:28,310
Oh, shit. It's Agent Smith.

458
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:36,359
Shit. What's going on?

459
01:42:38,539 --> 01:42:39,819
What? I just made it through.

460
01:42:45,579 --> 01:42:46,779
This isn't Hitman.

461
01:42:46,779 --> 01:42:48,220
You unlocked the cartwheel.

462
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:49,500
This guy does not know where I am.

463
01:42:50,380 --> 01:43:04,010
What'd he just drop?

464
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:05,210
Ooh, how do I use that?

465
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:06,890
Wait, how do I use the cartwheel?

466
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:16,579
I'm holding gun, hold down, focus, side step.

467
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:18,739
Okay, so you have to have a gun out.

468
01:43:18,739 --> 01:43:26,199
How does this not work?

469
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:54,920
Okay, I think I missed something here.

470
01:43:55,989 --> 01:43:58,550
This dude's flailing. I was told flailing is fine.

471
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:00,840
All right, I'm back.

472
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:12,659
Why did that guy climb?

473
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:14,739
He climbed on top.

474
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:21,380
Okay, what do I do?

475
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:42,340
Is this supposed to be a stealth mission?

476
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:42,739
Well, I...

477
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:46,250
Like, the character picked up the weapon.

478
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:46,729
I didn't want...

479
01:44:46,729 --> 01:44:48,010
No, look, I don't want this stuff.

480
01:44:48,010 --> 01:44:48,729
I didn't want to do that.

481
01:44:50,010 --> 01:45:06,390
How do I use flashbangs?

482
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:10,760
Circle strafe.

483
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:17,659
Use your strafe controls.

484
01:45:17,659 --> 01:45:18,939
Well, how do I strafe?

485
01:45:18,939 --> 01:45:22,760
Oh, hit strafe left and strafe right.

486
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:25,750
That doesn't help at all.

487
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,789
Hold target lock.

488
01:45:26,789 --> 01:45:35,479
Wait a minute, what's strafe?

489
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:48,060
Press strafe to strafe.

490
01:45:49,899 --> 01:45:58,920
This is not a cartwheel.

491
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,119
I'm sorry, but it's not.

492
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:05,930
I'm not dying in here.

493
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:44,020
Fucking get down, what?

494
01:46:44,579 --> 01:47:06,149
I can't adapt how you do it.

495
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:10,869
I'm gonna die.

496
01:47:10,869 --> 01:47:11,829
Please don't do it.

497
01:47:13,029 --> 01:47:20,739
Where am I supposed to go?

498
01:47:21,699 --> 01:47:25,380
This is gonna keep spawning on me

499
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:28,180
until I find the right door to plug into or whatever.

500
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:37,850
NVIDIA, the way it's meant to be played.

501
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:38,489
Holy shit.

502
01:47:39,210 --> 01:47:41,449
It's linear, just go forward.

503
01:47:41,449 --> 01:47:42,569
Isn't that where I just was?

504
01:47:43,369 --> 01:47:48,279
Oh, I was not here.

505
01:47:48,279 --> 01:47:49,399
Oh, all right, all right, all right.

506
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:20,710
That guy, the only one that got affected by it.

507
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:23,189
He looked over here.

508
01:48:26,649 --> 01:48:28,170
Oh my God, I just want to...

509
01:48:31,619 --> 01:48:55,500
Fuck.

510
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:57,579
They can see pretty well right now.

511
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:08,069
This is where you go.

512
01:49:08,069 --> 01:49:08,710
Everything's fine.

513
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:09,670
Oh, this is awk.

514
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:10,310
Everything's fine.

515
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:35,079
You need to throw a grenade at the window.

516
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:40,810
No, I don't.

517
01:49:41,369 --> 01:49:46,380
He didn't read.

518
01:49:48,489 --> 01:49:49,289
Use the grenade.

519
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,579
An actual grenade.

520
01:49:53,779 --> 01:49:54,979
I don't even have grenades.

521
01:49:56,199 --> 01:49:57,239
Is there a different grenade button?

522
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,020
That's a flashbang.

523
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,420
Okay, but I don't have actual grenades.

524
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:08,439
Weapons like fire, secondary fire.

525
01:50:08,439 --> 01:50:09,960
First person, kick, jump.

526
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,060
Do I... I don't have any grenades.

527
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:16,119
Shoot the glass.

528
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:21,770
I don't think there is.

529
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:32,520
No, I don't think there is.

530
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:38,470
Do you think it was trapped?

531
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:39,350
Try the big wall.

532
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:43,369
Hold on, let me just make sure.

533
01:50:43,369 --> 01:50:47,500
No, I didn't miss something over here.

534
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:56,920
I don't get it.

535
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:10,409
I think you need to use the superman dive.

536
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:29,420
Okay, where does it want me to go?

537
01:51:30,939 --> 01:51:32,220
I think I might actually be soft-locked.

538
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:42,229
It's the white button.

539
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:47,909
Yeah, the yellow...

540
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:49,750
Is something yellow in the room?

541
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:51,560
The yellow box?

542
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:52,600
Yeah, I can't touch it.

543
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:57,239
In the lockers?

544
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:03,539
This actually might be bugged.

545
01:52:03,539 --> 01:52:12,380
The flashbangs might have soft-locked the box.

546
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:14,060
That's the grenade box.

547
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,520
Oh, should I just refresh?

548
01:52:19,539 --> 01:52:20,340
I'll just refresh.

549
01:52:20,819 --> 01:52:22,600
How far away is the load, though?

550
01:52:23,239 --> 01:52:23,880
No, no, no, no, no.

551
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,439
Just shoot it.

552
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:26,680
Wall?

553
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,000
Run?

554
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:48,569
Follow the arrow.

555
01:52:48,569 --> 01:52:49,369
I can't.

556
01:52:49,369 --> 01:52:53,829
You could probably blow your way out of there.

557
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:56,039
Yeah?

558
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,500
It's broken.

559
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,220
I'm just going to relax.

560
01:53:01,939 --> 01:53:04,550
It's...

561
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:05,510
Okay, everything's fucked up.

562
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:06,550
I'm just going to...

563
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:09,420
I'm scared that if I do this, though...

564
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:19,350
Where am I going to be?

565
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:24,119
Shoot the box?

566
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:25,399
It's not shoot the box.

567
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:36,250
It's not...

568
01:53:36,250 --> 01:53:38,890
I guarantee it's not shoot the box.

569
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:43,460
I guarantee it.

570
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,539
This is not that far back.

571
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:48,180
That's one of them.

572
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:48,899
Get to the guns.

573
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:50,329
See?

574
01:53:50,329 --> 01:53:51,210
Okay, I just picked it up.

575
01:54:21,689 --> 01:54:23,289
All right, so now...

576
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:25,289
Flashbang.

577
01:54:27,449 --> 01:54:33,109
Why is it back?

578
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:47,829
You broke it again?

579
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:52,220
How did I do that?

580
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:07,319
You weren't soft-locked.

581
01:55:07,319 --> 01:55:08,199
You didn't break it.

582
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,260
Change to different...

583
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:15,659
Hold on.

584
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:19,000
What was that?

585
01:55:20,069 --> 01:55:21,029
Oh, I thought I shot...

586
01:55:21,029 --> 01:55:23,109
I thought I shot a harpoon out of my chest.

587
01:55:23,909 --> 01:55:24,630
All right, hold on.

588
01:55:25,689 --> 01:55:26,810
Do I have to do it again?

589
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:28,250
Equip the grenade.

590
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:35,659
I didn't know where to...

591
01:55:35,659 --> 01:55:36,140
Okay.

592
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:37,420
It didn't tell me to do that ever.

593
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:47,989
Let's go.

594
01:55:47,989 --> 01:56:06,380
Okay, now where do I go?

595
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,479
Oh, dude!

596
01:56:09,479 --> 01:56:11,800
Maximize your experience with Pentium IV.

597
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:13,579
That...

598
01:56:13,579 --> 01:56:14,699
A lot of computer ads.

599
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:36,310
What?

600
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:48,010
Stop!

601
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:53,989
Am I right?

602
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,899
Why did he go so fast?

603
01:57:21,079 --> 01:57:28,970
I thought the helicopter was inside of the building for a second.

604
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:31,449
Like, this is no way.

605
01:57:32,010 --> 01:57:57,100
Why are you saying F?

606
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:57,420
F?

607
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:57,899
What?

608
01:57:57,899 --> 01:57:58,699
Small F?

609
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:05,770
I don't see it on my end.

610
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:11,770
The only option is to fight.

611
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:24,600
I didn't even have a second to understand what was going on.

612
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:25,720
Maybe the switch is having a problem?

613
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:27,640
Okay, so don't...

614
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,579
Fuck you!

615
01:59:30,949 --> 01:59:38,260
Refresh my health!

616
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:53,909
Why is the health not counting up?

617
01:59:53,909 --> 01:59:54,630
I can't.

618
01:59:55,670 --> 01:59:57,989
Fourth wall break when he looked over his shoulder like,

619
01:59:57,989 --> 02:00:03,739
Whoa, man, this is crazy.

620
02:00:03,739 --> 02:00:05,180
The music is fucking me up, too.

621
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:05,659
It's just like...

622
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:10,619
The disk is to get things.

623
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:13,579
How do you do this without...

624
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:50,649
Where's the helicopter?

625
02:00:51,369 --> 02:01:03,079
Hell are you talking about?

626
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:04,439
Oh my god!

627
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:24,260
I'm so dead!

628
02:01:27,180 --> 02:01:28,859
Oh my goodness.

629
02:01:32,869 --> 02:01:33,270
This is...

630
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:35,050
This is ridiculous.

631
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:44,979
What's the way to actually go about doing this?

632
02:01:44,979 --> 02:01:48,180
Just use grenades on the helicopter?

633
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:49,220
I don't think that's gonna work.

634
02:03:03,079 --> 02:03:04,199
Why would you do that?

635
02:03:13,579 --> 02:03:16,920
Well, the helicopter's cycle is so weird.

636
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:17,800
Like, where is it?

637
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:27,829
I give up.

638
02:03:27,829 --> 02:03:28,710
What are you supposed to do about this?

639
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:34,760
Dodge the bullets?

640
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:36,600
Okay.

641
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,619
Excuse me.

642
02:03:38,619 --> 02:03:40,060
Just dodge the bullets.

643
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:43,109
That ain't gonna happen.

644
02:03:44,149 --> 02:04:22,619
Where's the helicopter?

645
02:04:28,630 --> 02:04:29,189
It goes around.

646
02:04:29,189 --> 02:04:29,430
It goes...

647
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:44,380
So then wait for it to turn around and knock up.

648
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:44,939
God damn it!

649
02:04:44,939 --> 02:04:45,739
I thought they were spawning.

650
02:04:46,380 --> 02:05:06,760
That was a good cycle.

651
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:08,279
Wait for the machine gun fire.

652
02:05:08,279 --> 02:05:08,920
Go across.

653
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:15,210
Yep.

654
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:17,109
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

655
02:05:17,109 --> 02:05:17,350
Go.

656
02:05:18,069 --> 02:05:26,039
Maybe one more cycle.

657
02:05:31,689 --> 02:05:32,890
Get off my screen!

658
02:06:05,479 --> 02:06:05,880
Yeah!

659
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:32,329
What does it want me to do?

660
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:42,310
Check the area for useful gear.

661
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:42,949
What does it want me to...

662
02:06:42,949 --> 02:07:45,880
I don't get it.

663
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:46,840
I have to get it.

664
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:47,880
I can't leave without it.

665
02:07:50,220 --> 02:08:01,800
Is there a crouch?

666
02:08:25,659 --> 02:08:32,100
I don't know what it wants me to do.

667
02:08:32,819 --> 02:08:38,819
Hey, did you ever heard of up dog?

668
02:08:40,140 --> 02:08:42,220
What is that thing you just said up dog?

669
02:08:42,220 --> 02:09:05,609
I don't know why it wants me to do this.

670
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:06,329
Good.

671
02:09:06,329 --> 02:09:07,770
I think it was just broken.

672
02:09:08,659 --> 02:09:11,460
I'm having a good time, but it might be time to move on to...

673
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:14,859
I don't know.

674
02:09:14,859 --> 02:09:16,460
Moving on sounds like a bad idea.

675
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:17,899
Hold on.

676
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:21,619
Not yet.

677
02:09:22,180 --> 02:09:22,500
Another...

678
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:24,420
I can't get past that gate.

679
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:27,819
The other walkway.

680
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:46,380
I don't know where I'm going.

681
02:09:46,380 --> 02:10:24,699
How'd you guys get over here?

682
02:10:25,340 --> 02:10:27,270
This wasn't open!

683
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:30,630
That was not just open 15 seconds ago.

684
02:10:31,430 --> 02:11:07,560
I was gonna say I almost like fogged too hard there.

685
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:08,600
And went out the window.

686
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:29,640
Lower the resolution to the face cam.

687
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:30,760
No, it'll break.

688
02:11:32,779 --> 02:11:33,979
I have it set perfectly right now.

689
02:11:33,979 --> 02:11:34,939
I don't want to fix it again.

690
02:11:40,489 --> 02:11:42,600
The piano will help you reach the roof.

691
02:11:43,239 --> 02:11:49,449
Is it piano?

692
02:12:19,909 --> 02:12:25,539
I love this music.

693
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:29,539
Butter!

694
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:39,100
I almost made it.

695
02:12:39,739 --> 02:13:06,840
Grab it!

696
02:13:30,939 --> 02:13:32,380
Wait on the piano.

697
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:43,159
Piano?

698
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:49,220
Aim, you idiot.

699
02:13:49,939 --> 02:13:53,189
Where's the piano?

700
02:14:21,880 --> 02:14:23,319
I have to pee so bad.

701
02:14:23,319 --> 02:14:30,439
Why is he looking for a piano in the ceiling?

702
02:14:30,439 --> 02:14:30,840
I'm not.

703
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:31,079
I'm...

704
02:14:35,239 --> 02:14:36,199
Where's this piano?

705
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:37,880
Wait for the piano.

706
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:53,479
Where's the piano?

707
02:14:54,279 --> 02:14:55,000
I'm being loud.

708
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:07,699
Okay.

709
02:15:07,699 --> 02:15:08,420
I don't...

710
02:15:08,420 --> 02:15:17,829
I don't know what was...

711
02:15:17,829 --> 02:15:19,189
Guys, this is a...

712
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,430
It's a...

713
02:15:20,229 --> 02:15:25,880
I'll go pee.

714
02:15:26,439 --> 02:15:28,920
We lost some time in there.

715
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:29,560
Where are they now?

716
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:30,840
Soren and his men have been cornered.

717
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:31,239
Give me a minute.

718
02:15:31,239 --> 02:15:32,520
AT-28 in the annex.

719
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,560
How's Naomi doing?

720
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:34,520
She's not dead yet.

721
02:15:36,789 --> 02:15:37,270
Okay.

722
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:38,069
I gotta pee a beer back.

723
02:15:38,789 --> 02:18:38,329
Got about the burn in.

724
02:18:38,329 --> 02:18:41,799
But something else that's very interesting.

725
02:18:41,799 --> 02:18:43,159
So I had this computer.

726
02:18:43,159 --> 02:18:45,559
This room gets really, really hot.

727
02:18:45,559 --> 02:18:48,420
Because this computer and, you know,

728
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:51,450
streaming and encoding and things

729
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:52,569
pretty much just cooking over here.

730
02:18:55,129 --> 02:18:58,459
The original Xbox is almost, I think,

731
02:18:58,459 --> 02:19:01,799
generating more heat than that computer.

732
02:19:01,799 --> 02:19:05,159
I went from just out of this room to back in here

733
02:19:05,159 --> 02:19:08,680
and it was at least 10% to 20% hotter in here

734
02:19:08,680 --> 02:19:11,530
than it's ever been.

735
02:19:11,530 --> 02:19:13,530
It's like a sauna in this room.

736
02:19:14,090 --> 02:19:16,760
This is ridiculous.

737
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:25,739
You should play Halo.

738
02:19:26,809 --> 02:19:27,209
I actually...

739
02:19:27,209 --> 02:19:27,770
I thought about it.

740
02:19:28,409 --> 02:19:29,209
Maybe one of these days.

741
02:19:30,739 --> 02:19:31,059
All right.

742
02:19:31,059 --> 02:19:32,579
So I'm not leaving yet.

743
02:19:33,219 --> 02:19:36,649
But I do want to give you a couple of options here.

744
02:19:36,649 --> 02:19:41,479
It's not over yet.

745
02:19:41,479 --> 02:19:44,629
But I want to pull in the chat.

746
02:19:44,629 --> 02:19:47,959
I'm going to give you three options to pivot from here.

747
02:19:47,959 --> 02:19:52,870
The first option is Cold Fear.

748
02:19:52,870 --> 02:20:00,250
The second option is Star Wars Obi-Wan.

749
02:20:04,059 --> 02:20:07,180
And the third option is Legends of Wrestling.

750
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:11,930
That's a tough one.

751
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:13,530
That's a very tough one.

752
02:20:13,530 --> 02:20:20,420
Is there a fourth option?

753
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:21,459
Go offline.

754
02:20:21,459 --> 02:20:25,430
It's a little too early for that.

755
02:20:28,299 --> 02:20:28,940
Okay.

756
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:29,420
Coming back.

757
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:35,159
Let's see.

758
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:35,879
What do you guys want?

759
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:40,379
It's still pretty early in the poll.

760
02:20:40,379 --> 02:20:46,979
Are you ever going to return to A Dead of Night?

761
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:47,459
No.

762
02:20:47,459 --> 02:20:47,780
Never.

763
02:20:49,030 --> 02:20:49,430
Never.

764
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:52,200
That's just not going to happen.

765
02:20:52,200 --> 02:21:01,530
I couldn't do it.

766
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:02,729
All right.

767
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:07,780
Unless the Obi-Wan fans can really pull this through,

768
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:10,180
Legends of Wrestling looks like it's going to be what we're doing.

769
02:21:10,180 --> 02:21:13,639
It's really not even close.

770
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:15,000
Go ahead and close it.

771
02:21:15,719 --> 02:21:17,559
Legends of Wrestling is up next.

772
02:21:17,559 --> 02:21:20,760
Okay.

773
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:21,639
Let's go.

774
02:21:21,639 --> 02:21:26,760
I'll play this for another 15 minutes.

775
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:38,709
That was the lamest action movie jump I've ever seen.

776
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:50,709
So loud.

777
02:21:50,709 --> 02:21:53,579
Is it?

778
02:21:53,579 --> 02:21:57,350
Oh, I didn't turn up the music.

779
02:21:57,989 --> 02:22:02,120
All right.

780
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,520
Does anybody else get like this when there's an escalator

781
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:07,059
and there's nobody in front of you?

782
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:09,530
Just go.

783
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:10,090
Hurry up.

784
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:10,329
Right?

785
02:22:15,579 --> 02:22:17,340
Sometimes I just sit there though.

786
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:21,100
Sometimes I just like, you know what?

787
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:21,579
I don't even care.

788
02:22:21,579 --> 02:22:23,420
I'm going to let the machine just do it for me.

789
02:22:24,059 --> 02:22:32,200
Are you not afraid of escalators?

790
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:37,379
Because to me in my brain,

791
02:22:37,379 --> 02:22:40,020
an escalator is an incredibly basic contraption.

792
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:43,780
All an escalator is, is just a thing.

793
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:45,780
It's just a tread that moves in a circle.

794
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,559
There's nothing really that mechanically ridiculous

795
02:22:49,559 --> 02:22:52,280
or strange about an escalator.

796
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:54,360
It's a very basic concept.

797
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:59,180
It's the stuff that has the complicated shit in the middle

798
02:22:59,180 --> 02:22:59,979
that freaks me out.

799
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:16,950
By the way, where am I going here?

800
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:17,270
Shoot.

801
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:21,079
What did I just, did I just command bullets to fly?

802
02:23:21,879 --> 02:23:27,020
It's still open.

803
02:23:27,020 --> 02:23:27,659
Now's your chance.

804
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:32,340
Oh, move.

805
02:23:32,899 --> 02:23:33,700
Check your gun.

806
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:41,260
Give the signal.

807
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:41,979
So open it.

808
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:45,579
Oops.

809
02:23:50,899 --> 02:23:52,100
For a second I thought he was talking.

810
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:53,299
I thought that was the person in my ear.

811
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:56,569
Escalator up at the second floor.

812
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:04,420
Technology.

813
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:15,479
How do you miss every single one of those?

814
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:36,979
No, my goodness.

815
02:24:36,979 --> 02:24:37,780
I'm going to die.

816
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:43,110
Not if I hide over here.

817
02:24:43,110 --> 02:25:10,760
Oh, escalator.

818
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,319
What?

819
02:25:11,319 --> 02:25:31,139
Why can I not take the escalator?

820
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:32,020
Take the stairs?

821
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:35,989
It said take the escalator, didn't it?

822
02:25:35,989 --> 02:25:39,909
Something I have to do with it?

823
02:25:39,909 --> 02:25:40,549
They're different.

824
02:25:40,549 --> 02:25:40,790
No.

825
02:25:52,819 --> 02:25:54,260
Anyone want to help me?

826
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:54,979
The different one?

827
02:25:55,620 --> 02:26:02,459
The game is chugging so hard right now.

828
02:26:02,700 --> 02:26:04,469
Okay.

829
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:07,190
It's a different escalator.

830
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:28,360
Oh, all right.

831
02:26:28,360 --> 02:26:29,239
There we, whoa.

832
02:26:29,959 --> 02:26:39,940
Where did it go?

833
02:26:39,940 --> 02:26:40,180
What?

834
02:26:40,180 --> 02:26:41,860
It went into the escalator.

835
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:52,600
There's a door leading there at the end of this hall.

836
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:53,000
Right here.

837
02:27:32,459 --> 02:27:33,100
Over the railing.

838
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:33,739
Over the railing.

839
02:27:33,739 --> 02:27:34,379
Over the railing.

840
02:27:34,379 --> 02:27:34,940
Come on.

841
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:36,459
Oh, and I didn't even do it in slow motion.

842
02:27:36,459 --> 02:27:37,180
I'm pissed.

843
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:59,049
Don't die here.

844
02:27:59,049 --> 02:27:59,530
Hold on.

845
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:07,030
Hide next with a bunch of exclamation points.

846
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:07,829
Relax.

847
02:28:07,829 --> 02:28:14,899
Okay.

848
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:16,790
He came, he's behind me.

849
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:17,110
Where?

850
02:28:18,489 --> 02:28:25,399
What?

851
02:28:25,399 --> 02:28:27,159
That was a cardboard cutout.

852
02:28:27,159 --> 02:28:32,180
Exactly five to 10 minutes from now.

853
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:34,340
We're going to do Legends of Rest.

854
02:28:34,579 --> 02:28:46,069
They get Axl off the ground.

855
02:28:46,069 --> 02:28:46,549
He's dead.

856
02:28:52,870 --> 02:28:53,350
Who's this?

857
02:29:00,379 --> 02:29:01,180
Find them.

858
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:04,790
Can't give him a car.

859
02:29:05,430 --> 02:29:06,979
Binary.

860
02:29:06,979 --> 02:29:08,180
Or like a golf cart.

861
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:10,709
We'll take you to such a double back.

862
02:29:10,709 --> 02:29:11,430
Ghost, can you cover us?

863
02:29:11,430 --> 02:29:12,549
Do they have to run?

864
02:29:12,549 --> 02:29:17,610
I got it.

865
02:29:17,610 --> 02:29:19,129
What is your field of fire?

866
02:29:19,690 --> 02:29:20,809
I've got the runway.

867
02:29:20,809 --> 02:29:22,170
How about the hangar?

868
02:29:22,170 --> 02:29:23,209
Provide sniper cover.

869
02:29:23,209 --> 02:29:23,850
I can cover that too.

870
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:24,969
I've got activity below.

871
02:29:24,969 --> 02:29:25,690
Top of the stairs.

872
02:29:25,690 --> 02:29:26,569
One of the suspects.

873
02:29:26,569 --> 02:29:27,450
The female.

874
02:29:27,450 --> 02:29:29,850
Clear shot.

875
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:30,569
Confirmed.

876
02:29:30,569 --> 02:29:33,780
Take them.

877
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,379
That was so, like such a,

878
02:29:35,379 --> 02:29:38,729
I thought we were on the same team.

879
02:29:38,729 --> 02:29:40,250
That was so overdone too.

880
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:42,170
Like I just, I'm on edge right now.

881
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:44,790
Why?

882
02:29:44,790 --> 02:29:46,629
I, in my brain,

883
02:29:46,629 --> 02:29:48,069
it was, I thought they were talking to,

884
02:29:48,069 --> 02:29:49,030
why am I in this room?

885
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:50,469
And why is everybody looking?

886
02:29:50,469 --> 02:29:51,829
Honest, that, please.

887
02:29:52,549 --> 02:29:54,520
I need to relax.

888
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:57,690
I need to calm down.

889
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:59,180
Okay.

890
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:04,020
That was so completely overdone.

891
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:06,139
In my brain, it was like,

892
02:30:06,139 --> 02:30:08,219
there's not a single reason ever.

893
02:30:08,219 --> 02:30:15,940
Like I thought we were on the same team for a second.

894
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:17,860
It was like, oh, get the sniper rifle and support.

895
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:18,819
And they were talking.

896
02:30:18,819 --> 02:30:20,100
Why am I even in the room?

897
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:20,979
Is what I'm trying to say.

898
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:29,430
Why do I shoot this?

899
02:30:31,129 --> 02:30:34,280
How do you, how do you zoom in?

900
02:30:35,079 --> 02:30:48,040
Was that my teammate?

901
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:48,680
I don't know.

902
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:54,520
Was that the guy I'm supposed to protect?

903
02:30:57,059 --> 02:30:57,700
Fuck.

904
02:30:57,700 --> 02:30:58,739
I think that was,

905
02:30:58,739 --> 02:31:00,020
I think that was a good guy.

906
02:31:07,049 --> 02:31:09,690
He was just in the cut scene.

907
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:19,450
I'm so stupid.

908
02:31:21,020 --> 02:31:21,500
I don't know.

909
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:22,780
It's just like, there's a,

910
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:26,379
just a trailing short-term memory where it just ends.

911
02:31:26,940 --> 02:31:29,020
There's a period where I'll remember anything,

912
02:31:29,659 --> 02:31:33,500
but it just ends here and it just moves along on a track.

913
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:37,100
And it's just everything that's back behind here is gone

914
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:39,500
in short-term memory.

915
02:31:41,799 --> 02:31:43,239
I can't believe I did that.

916
02:31:49,530 --> 02:31:53,780
Do you see people are talking and it's like,

917
02:31:53,780 --> 02:31:54,579
look, help.

918
02:31:54,579 --> 02:31:56,340
We were all talking about helping each other.

919
02:31:56,579 --> 02:31:57,860
I've got a clear shot.

920
02:31:58,420 --> 02:31:59,139
Confirm.

921
02:31:59,139 --> 02:31:59,940
Take the shot.

922
02:32:01,079 --> 02:32:01,639
Sure thing.

923
02:32:10,489 --> 02:32:12,090
Cover the stairs below the roof.

924
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:12,329
Okay.

925
02:32:12,329 --> 02:32:13,129
All right, all right, right, right.

926
02:32:21,979 --> 02:32:23,500
No, that's somebody else on the team.

927
02:32:24,059 --> 02:32:25,260
That's somebody else.

928
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:26,299
Where do you want me to fight?

929
02:32:33,370 --> 02:32:35,690
What the hell are you, what?

930
02:33:12,629 --> 02:33:23,420
Cover the stairs below the roof.

931
02:33:23,420 --> 02:33:27,420
Why can you even walk forward?

932
02:33:27,420 --> 02:33:33,219
Why can you walk forward there?

933
02:33:33,219 --> 02:33:35,219
What is your field of fire?

934
02:33:35,219 --> 02:33:36,340
I've got the runway.

935
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:37,379
How about the hangar?

936
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:39,540
I have a blindfold on.

937
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:41,139
I've got activity below.

938
02:33:41,139 --> 02:33:42,979
It's one of the suspects, the female.

939
02:33:42,979 --> 02:33:44,629
A clear shot.

940
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:50,940
Let's take the shot on the tower.

941
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:52,299
Machine gunner, lower balcony.

942
02:33:54,229 --> 02:33:55,430
I have to throw this guy out.

943
02:34:00,629 --> 02:34:01,030
Okay.

944
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:04,229
So where, what do I have to do on the lower staircase?

945
02:34:09,989 --> 02:34:10,309
Shit.

946
02:34:13,239 --> 02:34:13,799
Down here.

947
02:34:16,709 --> 02:34:18,149
These motherfuckers right here.

948
02:34:19,030 --> 02:34:36,069
Get to the balcony downstairs and help.

949
02:34:36,069 --> 02:35:07,190
Okay.

950
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,989
Come on.

951
02:35:07,989 --> 02:35:09,030
There's no way.

952
02:35:09,030 --> 02:35:10,459
That kills you.

953
02:35:10,459 --> 02:35:12,059
There's no way that kills you.

954
02:35:12,059 --> 02:35:16,340
How far down do we have to go?

955
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:16,979
Times up.

956
02:35:16,979 --> 02:35:21,739
No, it's not up.

957
02:35:21,739 --> 02:35:23,100
What is your field of fire?

958
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:31,100
Who are you talking to still?

959
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:02,280
This is such a weird angle too.

960
02:36:26,200 --> 02:36:27,479
What do you mean I passed it?

961
02:36:27,479 --> 02:36:29,399
Guys, come on.

962
02:36:29,399 --> 02:36:30,680
This is a fool me once scenario.

963
02:36:31,799 --> 02:36:32,920
There's always just a dead end.

964
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:34,760
Five feet in front of these doors.

965
02:36:48,819 --> 02:36:49,059
No.

966
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:56,180
I'm back to the top of the tower.

967
02:36:56,899 --> 02:37:00,760
Are you serious?

968
02:37:00,760 --> 02:37:14,940
I just, okay, we're good.

969
02:37:14,940 --> 02:37:15,260
All right.

970
02:37:15,979 --> 02:37:18,059
In exactly five minutes, I'm moving on.

971
02:37:18,059 --> 02:37:33,079
I promise.

972
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:44,979
They shot the cover off the front tire.

973
02:37:44,979 --> 02:37:51,290
Take the tire out of the plane or the car.

974
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:56,360
I don't think that's how that would work.

975
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:57,959
But you know, whatever.

976
02:38:00,729 --> 02:38:01,530
Where are they?

977
02:38:53,579 --> 02:39:00,809
You have to take out that copter with a sniper rifle.

978
02:39:07,049 --> 02:39:07,370
Okay.

979
02:39:19,059 --> 02:39:20,340
It was like a little animal.

980
02:39:28,819 --> 02:39:29,379
Give me a chance.

981
02:39:39,850 --> 02:39:41,049
2.5 minutes left.

982
02:39:41,049 --> 02:39:44,170
Yeah, I have to do that again.

983
02:39:47,739 --> 02:39:49,819
Oh, I hope I can do this twice.

984
02:39:49,819 --> 02:39:52,700
This game is awesome though.

985
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:54,940
I might just come back and play this another like later.

986
02:39:54,940 --> 02:40:08,340
Okay.

987
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:08,579
All right.

988
02:40:08,579 --> 02:40:11,959
Get out, get out, get out.

989
02:40:11,959 --> 02:40:14,389
Where is the where's it right in front of me?

990
02:41:02,739 --> 02:41:42,729
Is he alive?

991
02:41:42,729 --> 02:41:43,620
Was he dead?

992
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:44,180
Is he alive?

993
02:41:44,180 --> 02:41:45,139
I don't know if he's, is he dead?

994
02:41:49,370 --> 02:41:50,489
That was unfair.

995
02:41:50,489 --> 02:41:52,170
That was actually unfair.

996
02:41:52,170 --> 02:41:56,950
I thought he was still alive.

997
02:41:56,950 --> 02:41:59,190
I thought he was going to shoot me like three or four more times.

998
02:42:01,139 --> 02:42:02,100
Time's up.

999
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:04,780
5.46 is the prediction.

1000
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:05,180
Okay.

1001
02:42:08,659 --> 02:42:09,540
I had that too.

1002
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:15,690
That was annoying.

1003
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:16,729
You have 15 seconds.

1004
02:42:16,729 --> 02:42:17,450
5.46.

1005
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:29,879
So the mods have told me.

1006
02:42:29,879 --> 02:42:43,260
I wonder.

1007
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:44,059
Oh, yeah.

1008
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:45,020
All right.

1009
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:48,149
I got it right here.

1010
02:42:48,149 --> 02:42:49,350
You just got to go right in.

1011
02:42:55,129 --> 02:42:55,770
What?

1012
02:42:55,770 --> 02:42:56,409
Get the help.

1013
02:42:58,500 --> 02:43:01,639
What?

1014
02:43:01,639 --> 02:43:02,360
Who just did that?

1015
02:43:03,079 --> 02:43:05,700
What's this?

1016
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:14,920
Did I skip a cut scene?

1017
02:43:16,229 --> 02:43:17,829
There was no way to go down.

1018
02:43:17,829 --> 02:43:19,750
Did I skip the cut scene?

1019
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:30,340
I heard hurry up.

1020
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:32,260
I'm I'm I'll get it right now.

1021
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:36,579
I got the strategy door opened.

1022
02:43:36,579 --> 02:43:37,299
You didn't even look.

1023
02:43:37,299 --> 02:43:38,659
I did.

1024
02:43:38,659 --> 02:43:42,170
But I didn't know I had literally five seconds to move.

1025
02:43:42,729 --> 02:43:45,540
It just was like, oh, get the heck out of there.

1026
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:45,780
Okay.

1027
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:46,579
Get the heck out of there.

1028
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:52,329
You know, many times we've heard get out of there in this game in the last two and a half hours.

1029
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:25,180
Okay.

1030
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:28,379
I was going to say there's not a single chance that would happen.

1031
02:44:28,379 --> 02:44:40,809
I can't believe I shot this guy in that.

1032
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:47,750
We'll need a car.

1033
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:49,270
Wait, what?

1034
02:44:50,069 --> 02:44:53,540
Weren't we just going down?

1035
02:44:53,540 --> 02:44:54,579
Why are we back up?

1036
02:44:54,579 --> 02:44:55,940
I thought the whole point was to get out of here.

1037
02:45:02,489 --> 02:45:04,389
Is this a full letter grade?

1038
02:45:04,389 --> 02:45:05,670
Because if it is, I am not leaving.

1039
02:45:24,889 --> 02:45:28,870
That person's dead.

1040
02:45:29,430 --> 02:45:30,469
That person is dead.

1041
02:45:31,110 --> 02:45:54,020
I thought it was supposed to be exactly five more minutes.

1042
02:45:54,020 --> 02:45:54,819
It is.

1043
02:45:54,819 --> 02:45:57,540
But if there's a if I get to actually drive the car, I get to add it.

1044
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:59,379
Hey, ghost, I've tapped in.

1045
02:45:59,379 --> 02:46:00,659
No, I don't care.

1046
02:46:01,700 --> 02:46:02,899
Do you want me to leave now?

1047
02:46:02,899 --> 02:46:03,379
No way.

1048
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:39,290
Don't lose it.

1049
02:46:40,649 --> 02:46:42,090
Drive the car.

1050
02:46:42,090 --> 02:46:42,489
Drive.

1051
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:44,979
Now he's on that plane.

1052
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:55,479
I love the way he's driving too.

1053
02:46:55,479 --> 02:47:07,540
This is a great game.

1054
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:08,659
I love this game.

1055
02:47:08,659 --> 02:47:11,899
It gets it.

1056
02:47:11,899 --> 02:47:17,500
I know it's like an old lady.

1057
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:39,399
Is there a horn?

1058
02:47:39,959 --> 02:48:02,840
What are they dropping?

1059
02:48:27,770 --> 02:48:32,329
Someone fell out of the plane.

1060
02:48:35,129 --> 02:48:45,829
Who fell out of the plane?

1061
02:49:01,540 --> 02:49:02,260
Who is this?

1062
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:07,459
What is happening?

1063
02:49:08,260 --> 02:49:13,860
Did they fall out of the plane?

1064
02:49:39,829 --> 02:49:40,950
What am I supposed to be doing?

1065
02:49:43,159 --> 02:49:44,440
I just don't understand.

1066
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:51,799
Go up the ramp?

1067
02:49:55,959 --> 02:49:57,399
This car is smoking.

1068
02:49:58,200 --> 02:49:59,500
There's a ramp?

1069
02:50:00,299 --> 02:50:08,899
I'm on top of their car.

1070
02:50:19,059 --> 02:50:19,780
What ramp?

1071
02:50:20,500 --> 02:50:21,299
There was a ramp?

1072
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:29,739
There's an arrow.

1073
02:50:29,739 --> 02:50:30,540
Follow the arrow.

1074
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:32,459
Don't do 10 HA's.

1075
02:50:34,379 --> 02:50:35,100
Hey, ghost.

1076
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:35,739
I'll get it right now.

1077
02:50:35,739 --> 02:50:36,459
Tapped in.

1078
02:50:36,459 --> 02:50:37,500
Car CB radio.

1079
02:50:38,219 --> 02:50:39,420
Keep following the plane.

1080
02:50:40,139 --> 02:50:40,700
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1081
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:43,020
I couldn't see the ramp with all the mud on the screen.

1082
02:50:43,899 --> 02:51:02,709
Play Breath of the Wild.

1083
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:05,829
Not today.

1084
02:51:06,709 --> 02:51:33,450
I'm just waiting for him to turn around and do that look.

1085
02:51:36,379 --> 02:51:37,420
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1086
02:51:38,219 --> 02:51:38,860
Pay attention.

1087
02:51:46,760 --> 02:51:49,190
Someone's falling out of the plane.

1088
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:49,690
Okay.

1089
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:54,149
Pick him up when he lands.

1090
02:51:55,190 --> 02:51:55,989
Don't lose him.

1091
02:51:56,790 --> 02:52:01,340
I didn't see anybody fall out of the plane.

1092
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:31,639
I didn't even see it.

1093
02:52:31,639 --> 02:52:32,920
I accidentally just did that.

1094
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:33,319
How would you?

1095
02:52:33,319 --> 02:52:35,399
How did you even see that was here?

1096
02:52:35,399 --> 02:52:36,840
How did you know that was here?

1097
02:52:37,479 --> 02:53:05,079
My car can't even fit through this fucking hole.

1098
02:53:05,079 --> 02:53:07,239
Am I going the right way?

1099
02:53:14,680 --> 02:53:15,879
This is insane.

1100
02:53:17,319 --> 02:53:17,959
Oh, no.

1101
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:27,049
Please push me.

1102
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:29,209
Push me, push me, push me, push me, push me.

1103
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:30,409
Push me out.

1104
02:53:31,459 --> 02:53:32,020
Drive forward.

1105
02:53:32,020 --> 02:53:32,659
Push me out.

1106
02:53:32,659 --> 02:53:33,620
Please drive forward.

1107
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:35,860
Drive forward and push me out.

1108
02:53:38,329 --> 02:53:38,729
Please.

1109
02:53:38,729 --> 02:53:39,530
I don't want to do this again.

1110
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:40,170
Drive forward.

1111
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:06,579
Push me out.

1112
02:54:09,780 --> 02:54:11,219
Oh, it's so close.

1113
02:54:11,219 --> 02:54:11,540
Do it.

1114
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:11,940
Keep going.

1115
02:54:11,940 --> 02:54:12,260
Keep going.

1116
02:54:12,260 --> 02:54:14,100
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1117
02:54:14,100 --> 02:54:14,420
Yes.

1118
02:54:15,219 --> 02:54:32,200
What the fuck are you talking about?

1119
02:54:32,840 --> 02:54:42,790
This driving level is...

1120
02:54:43,750 --> 02:54:44,950
I just...

1121
02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:46,870
Damn, he's going to beat you to axle.

1122
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:47,370
What?

1123
02:54:47,989 --> 02:54:56,920
Whatever you do is that car.

1124
02:54:58,840 --> 02:55:03,110
This car is...

1125
02:55:03,110 --> 02:55:04,069
I can't have control.

1126
02:55:19,719 --> 02:55:21,879
I can't see because of the smoke.

1127
02:55:21,879 --> 02:55:22,360
Am I going...

1128
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:28,180
He's getting away with the axle.

1129
02:55:37,850 --> 02:55:47,719
Which way?

1130
02:55:48,520 --> 02:55:56,280
Did I accidentally pick the right door?

1131
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:59,420
Oh, my God.

1132
02:55:59,420 --> 02:56:00,299
That was unbelievable.

1133
02:56:00,299 --> 02:56:02,120
That was ridiculous.

1134
02:56:02,120 --> 02:56:03,319
That was so hard.

1135
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:07,459
I loved it, though.

1136
02:56:07,459 --> 02:56:23,219
Pretty good wall run by that car.

1137
02:56:53,829 --> 02:56:54,309
Hold on.

1138
02:56:54,309 --> 02:56:55,909
Okay, I'll call you when we get close.

1139
02:56:55,909 --> 02:56:56,409
Wait.

1140
02:57:08,180 --> 02:57:13,989
This is fun.

1141
02:57:13,989 --> 02:57:15,430
I guess you were due for some luck.

1142
02:57:15,590 --> 02:57:16,790
Did you get Soren out?

1143
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:17,290
Yeah.

1144
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:19,110
And call the rest of the fleet.

1145
02:57:19,110 --> 02:57:19,610
Good.

1146
02:57:19,989 --> 02:57:23,159
Let's get the hell out of here.

1147
02:57:23,159 --> 02:57:24,680
Remember, I fully support you.

1148
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:33,190
Just play this all day and do Xbox another night.

1149
02:57:33,190 --> 02:57:36,629
Let's just watch this last DMCA cutscene and we'll figure it out.

1150
02:57:37,190 --> 02:57:41,690
Axel, that's your dust-off.

1151
02:57:41,690 --> 02:57:42,809
I think we're all right.

1152
02:57:42,809 --> 02:57:43,309
I'll move on.

1153
02:57:43,309 --> 02:57:44,809
I'm sorry, guys, you wouldn't have done what you did.

1154
02:57:44,809 --> 02:57:46,950
Thank you for it.

1155
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:48,950
Depends on how interesting the next mission starts.

1156
02:57:48,950 --> 02:57:49,510
I'd rather kill you.

1157
02:57:49,510 --> 02:57:50,010
You know what I mean?

1158
02:57:50,389 --> 02:57:53,190
I'm just glad fate brought you to the airport.

1159
02:57:53,190 --> 02:57:55,479
I'm not sure you'll agree with that tomorrow.

1160
02:57:56,040 --> 02:57:57,639
Just tell Soren midnight.

1161
02:57:57,639 --> 02:57:58,520
He'll know the place.

1162
02:57:59,719 --> 02:58:11,819
He is fast.

1163
02:58:11,819 --> 02:58:12,459
I will say that.

1164
02:58:12,459 --> 02:58:13,180
Come back to this game.

1165
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:27,000
72 hours.

1166
02:58:28,299 --> 02:58:29,500
72?

1167
02:58:31,579 --> 02:58:32,540
What did you just say?

1168
02:58:33,340 --> 02:58:38,020
That's exactly how long, Zion.

1169
02:58:38,020 --> 02:58:39,540
What do you mean and who are you?

1170
02:58:40,659 --> 02:58:41,159
Me?

1171
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:44,389
I thought that was Adam Sandler for one second.

1172
02:58:49,559 --> 02:58:51,639
72 hours.

1173
02:58:51,639 --> 02:58:57,510
I don't know why.

1174
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,340
Actually, how?

1175
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:02,819
I don't know.

1176
02:59:03,620 --> 02:59:05,139
It was like 72 hours.

1177
02:59:09,370 --> 02:59:11,700
It's just 72 hours.

1178
02:59:11,700 --> 02:59:12,200
Right?

1179
02:59:12,659 --> 02:59:26,709
That was a bad imitation.

1180
02:59:27,350 --> 02:59:27,909
No, it wasn't.

1181
02:59:27,909 --> 02:59:28,629
That was fine.

1182
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,319
You're here.

1183
02:59:31,319 --> 02:59:37,290
Ghost?

1184
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:38,090
No wrestling?

1185
02:59:38,090 --> 02:59:38,590
No, I-

1186
02:59:38,590 --> 02:59:39,129
We're waiting.

1187
02:59:39,129 --> 02:59:39,629
Just wait.

1188
02:59:40,250 --> 02:59:41,829
Has everyone arrived?

1189
02:59:41,829 --> 02:59:42,790
That sounded like Yoda.

1190
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:44,069
I have a Kineser.

1191
02:59:44,069 --> 02:59:44,569
Figures.

1192
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:46,579
Think for an entrance.

1193
02:59:59,049 --> 02:59:59,549
Captains.

1194
03:00:02,120 --> 03:00:03,399
Captain Niobe.

1195
03:00:03,399 --> 03:00:05,399
My crew and I appreciate what you did for us.

1196
03:00:05,399 --> 03:00:07,000
It's not illegal if it's on a video game disc.

1197
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:07,959
He's alive.

1198
03:00:07,959 --> 03:00:09,219
Happy to be.

1199
03:00:09,219 --> 03:00:09,940
Let's get going.

1200
03:00:09,940 --> 03:00:12,979
Because you know Morpheus is not going to show up until we get started.

1201
03:00:12,979 --> 03:00:13,540
I agree.

1202
03:00:13,540 --> 03:00:16,020
I don't like us all being in the same place for too long.

1203
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:18,180
Why don't you tell us what this is all about, Niobe?

1204
03:00:18,180 --> 03:00:20,180
The machines are digging.

1205
03:00:24,250 --> 03:00:25,530
Tell that to the judge.

1206
03:00:50,809 --> 03:00:51,309
Shit.

1207
03:00:51,309 --> 03:00:54,090
It's the feds.

1208
03:00:55,290 --> 03:00:56,170
Get to your exits.

1209
03:01:02,659 --> 03:01:06,420
You know, they could just cut the pipes up there so nobody has to duck anymore.

1210
03:01:06,420 --> 03:01:11,829
Get some pipes, these cutters, and just cut the top.

1211
03:01:11,829 --> 03:01:12,709
People don't-

1212
03:01:12,709 --> 03:01:14,549
You've clearly cut them already.

1213
03:01:14,549 --> 03:01:15,909
They're perfectly cut.

1214
03:01:15,909 --> 03:01:16,409
Straight across.

1215
03:01:17,030 --> 03:01:18,309
Go up by one- two feet.

1216
03:01:19,860 --> 03:01:20,659
All right, here we go.

1217
03:01:21,459 --> 03:01:22,020
Is this-

1218
03:01:23,270 --> 03:01:25,430
Beginning of this mission interesting enough for me to keep playing?

1219
03:01:25,430 --> 03:01:26,069
Let's find out.

1220
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:35,940
I'm telling you, if he hops on a motorcycle, I ain't going anywhere.

1221
03:01:36,579 --> 03:01:41,180
All right, that was pretty funny.

1222
03:01:41,180 --> 03:01:41,899
I might have to stay.

1223
03:01:42,459 --> 03:02:04,520
So Legends of Wrestling is coming up next.

1224
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:06,760
Seems like a fun thing to do.

1225
03:02:06,760 --> 03:02:08,950
Seems like an interesting game to play.

1226
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:11,139
That was the Matrix.

1227
03:02:11,139 --> 03:02:12,700
Enter the Matrix.

1228
03:02:12,700 --> 03:02:13,420
We're going to move on.

1229
03:02:15,159 --> 03:02:22,620
Let me just make sure I don't burn the screen in with the next thing.

1230
03:02:22,620 --> 03:02:23,260
I just-

1231
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:33,219
I don't really want to climb up all that right now.

1232
03:02:33,219 --> 03:02:33,780
All right.

1233
03:02:33,780 --> 03:02:35,540
Legends of Wrestling, where are you?

1234
03:02:35,540 --> 03:02:46,299
Did he beat it?

1235
03:02:46,299 --> 03:02:46,780
No, I didn't.

1236
03:02:47,420 --> 03:02:49,030
I did not beat it.

1237
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:53,579
Will you go back to the Matrix?

1238
03:02:55,659 --> 03:02:57,219
I mean, that was really fun.

1239
03:02:58,840 --> 03:02:59,319
Maybe.

1240
03:02:59,319 --> 03:03:00,040
I don't know.

1241
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:01,319
We gave it a solid three hours.

1242
03:03:03,579 --> 03:03:05,260
That was double overtime.

1243
03:03:05,260 --> 03:03:10,440
That was a double overtime.

1244
03:03:16,059 --> 03:03:19,420
Usually it's about 40 minutes to an hour for each one of these.

1245
03:03:19,420 --> 03:03:21,690
I thought it was double, triple overtime almost.

1246
03:03:27,770 --> 03:03:28,569
Okay, here we go.

1247
03:03:28,569 --> 03:03:33,610
Hold on.

1248
03:03:33,610 --> 03:03:34,090
Can you see?

1249
03:03:35,780 --> 03:03:37,379
A great disc loading action.

1250
03:03:38,790 --> 03:03:39,290
Yeah.

1251
03:04:16,760 --> 03:04:17,319
All right.

1252
03:04:17,319 --> 03:04:18,040
I'm interested.

1253
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:37,899
Everyone is so hyped for me to play this, but I don't know.

1254
03:04:37,899 --> 03:04:39,579
I feel like this is maybe-

1255
03:04:40,540 --> 03:04:41,040
Wait.

1256
03:04:41,659 --> 03:04:42,219
I don't know.

1257
03:04:43,020 --> 03:04:44,489
I'm not going to pretend to know.

1258
03:04:45,209 --> 03:04:48,680
Because this could just be kind of not that fun.

1259
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:50,680
I don't know.

1260
03:04:52,100 --> 03:04:54,899
This game is legitimately not that good.

1261
03:04:54,899 --> 03:04:55,860
That's what somebody just said.

1262
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:00,979
Okay.

1263
03:05:00,979 --> 03:05:11,530
Hold on.

1264
03:05:11,530 --> 03:05:12,409
Ban that guy?

1265
03:05:24,840 --> 03:05:39,110
We're creating a wrestler.

1266
03:05:39,110 --> 03:05:40,069
Barrel chest?

1267
03:05:40,069 --> 03:05:40,709
Heavyweight.

1268
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:43,399
Muscle?

1269
03:05:45,370 --> 03:05:45,770
Skinny?

1270
03:05:46,489 --> 03:05:48,100
The audio is bad?

1271
03:05:54,409 --> 03:05:54,909
Skinny?

1272
03:05:56,360 --> 03:05:56,860
Skinny?

1273
03:05:59,370 --> 03:06:00,090
All right, fine.

1274
03:06:18,059 --> 03:06:19,819
How about Mean Green?

1275
03:06:19,819 --> 03:06:29,239
That's fine.

1276
03:06:29,319 --> 03:06:30,280
Wait, modify.

1277
03:06:31,159 --> 03:06:31,879
Oh, hold on.

1278
03:06:41,379 --> 03:06:43,299
Light, medium, or heavy hair?

1279
03:06:45,059 --> 03:06:47,299
Oh, it's how much hair is on my body?

1280
03:06:48,020 --> 03:06:56,760
Okay.

1281
03:07:01,139 --> 03:07:01,780
Upper body.

1282
03:07:26,229 --> 03:07:27,030
I like this one.

1283
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:36,549
He has sprayed on clothes.

1284
03:07:55,239 --> 03:07:55,739
All right.

1285
03:07:59,530 --> 03:08:00,250
Right arm?

1286
03:08:01,209 --> 03:08:01,610
Hold on.

1287
03:08:01,610 --> 03:08:03,450
Can I have like a huge arm?

1288
03:08:07,479 --> 03:08:08,040
Okay.

1289
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:10,040
He's going to have a huge right arm.

1290
03:08:10,840 --> 03:08:28,280
Goodness.

1291
03:08:29,719 --> 03:08:31,159
Should I have diney hands?

1292
03:08:31,879 --> 03:08:33,479
Like, diney hands are huge hands.

1293
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:36,520
Hold on.

1294
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:37,559
This is really loud.

1295
03:08:43,930 --> 03:08:44,430
Tiny?

1296
03:08:44,969 --> 03:08:47,510
Let's see what it looks like when it's huge, though.

1297
03:08:58,120 --> 03:08:58,360
Okay.

1298
03:08:58,920 --> 03:08:59,479
I'm sorry.

1299
03:08:59,479 --> 03:08:59,959
It's that.

1300
03:09:07,459 --> 03:09:08,979
Wait, diseased?

1301
03:09:08,979 --> 03:09:09,940
Oh, what the fuck?

1302
03:09:17,770 --> 03:09:19,290
I'm going to do ripped.

1303
03:09:19,290 --> 03:09:29,770
Okay.

1304
03:09:31,670 --> 03:09:32,309
Left arm.

1305
03:10:19,319 --> 03:10:19,819
Okay.

1306
03:10:22,579 --> 03:10:23,459
Wait, torso.

1307
03:10:23,459 --> 03:10:24,739
Torso, torso.

1308
03:10:24,739 --> 03:10:25,370
Should I?

1309
03:10:25,370 --> 03:10:25,770
No, no.

1310
03:10:25,770 --> 03:10:26,329
Keep it that way.

1311
03:10:28,809 --> 03:10:29,930
Lower body pelvis.

1312
03:10:37,180 --> 03:10:38,299
Should I have a huge?

1313
03:10:41,799 --> 03:10:43,079
You're making a crab.

1314
03:10:50,760 --> 03:10:52,120
That's just strange looking.

1315
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:53,600
Okay.

1316
03:10:54,139 --> 03:11:19,430
Do these all be tiny?

1317
03:11:20,780 --> 03:11:21,819
Make it opposites.

1318
03:11:31,459 --> 03:11:33,379
You couldn't even stand on these.

1319
03:11:35,159 --> 03:11:35,799
This is...

1320
03:11:35,799 --> 03:11:36,040
Okay.

1321
03:11:36,040 --> 03:11:38,520
It just looks like somebody pinched and went like this.

1322
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:35,639
That doesn't look right.

1323
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:46,180
Please mute the sound.

1324
03:12:48,409 --> 03:12:48,809
There.

1325
03:12:48,809 --> 03:12:49,530
It's not as bad.

1326
03:13:25,879 --> 03:13:34,840
I don't know.

1327
03:13:34,840 --> 03:13:36,200
No, it's definitely tiny.

1328
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:55,290
I kind of want to take the mask off and have it just have this.

1329
03:13:55,290 --> 03:14:05,319
I love how it's coming through the mask.

1330
03:14:05,319 --> 03:14:06,280
Okay, hold on.

1331
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:31,219
It stays on skinny.

1332
03:14:31,219 --> 03:14:32,819
It's staying on skinny.

1333
03:14:32,819 --> 03:14:40,950
Yeah, take it off.

1334
03:14:40,950 --> 03:14:41,190
Take...

1335
03:14:41,190 --> 03:14:44,250
Yeah, just none.

1336
03:14:44,250 --> 03:14:46,200
Okay, I think we're good.

1337
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:51,899
Entrance gear?

1338
03:14:51,899 --> 03:14:52,299
Iron?

1339
03:14:54,100 --> 03:14:54,979
A flag?

1340
03:14:55,540 --> 03:14:57,899
A scepter?

1341
03:14:57,899 --> 03:15:00,870
A spear?

1342
03:15:00,870 --> 03:15:02,870
He's going to come out with the US flag.

1343
03:15:06,569 --> 03:15:07,209
A spear?

1344
03:15:08,010 --> 03:15:14,739
He's going to come out with a scepter.

1345
03:15:27,209 --> 03:15:28,250
I don't know.

1346
03:15:28,250 --> 03:15:39,770
He's coming out with a cape.

1347
03:15:39,850 --> 03:15:41,209
He should come out with a hat.

1348
03:15:41,209 --> 03:16:00,790
This guy sucks.

1349
03:16:00,790 --> 03:16:03,959
Okay, you know what this looks like to me?

1350
03:16:03,959 --> 03:16:04,680
It's just like what...

1351
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:09,340
This looks like an AI-generated person.

1352
03:16:09,340 --> 03:16:16,459
It's like, oh, a man with a hat on holding a scepter has big legs and is very muscular.

1353
03:16:16,459 --> 03:16:29,420
It's like this is what it makes.

1354
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:30,299
Kind of like that.

1355
03:16:30,299 --> 03:16:38,260
I like that.

1356
03:16:38,260 --> 03:16:48,500
I can't wait to lose every match.

1357
03:16:48,500 --> 03:16:51,930
Okay, I think I'm ready.

1358
03:16:51,930 --> 03:16:52,329
Weight?

1359
03:16:52,329 --> 03:17:00,280
What about attributes?

1360
03:17:00,280 --> 03:17:01,719
Strong?

1361
03:17:01,719 --> 03:17:04,520
Super charismatic?

1362
03:17:04,520 --> 03:17:05,079
That's all.

1363
03:17:05,079 --> 03:17:09,260
I can't do any more points.

1364
03:17:09,260 --> 03:17:09,979
No, fuck that.

1365
03:17:10,219 --> 03:17:11,420
Everybody just loves this guy.

1366
03:17:11,420 --> 03:17:12,219
You know what I mean?

1367
03:17:12,219 --> 03:17:24,420
Brawling?

1368
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,879
All right, high risk.

1369
03:17:25,879 --> 03:17:28,360
Cheating?

1370
03:17:28,360 --> 03:17:29,479
Hold on.

1371
03:17:29,479 --> 03:17:30,600
High risk or cheating?

1372
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:34,600
What's better?

1373
03:17:34,600 --> 03:17:35,479
Definitely cheating.

1374
03:17:35,479 --> 03:17:35,959
There's no way.

1375
03:17:35,959 --> 03:17:37,479
I'm definitely cheating.

1376
03:17:37,479 --> 03:17:53,860
Okay, size?

1377
03:17:53,860 --> 03:17:56,409
That is just...

1378
03:17:56,409 --> 03:17:57,450
Okay, that's not...

1379
03:17:57,450 --> 03:17:58,489
That doesn't do anything.

1380
03:17:58,489 --> 03:18:08,709
Okay, appearance.

1381
03:18:08,709 --> 03:18:09,590
I already did that.

1382
03:18:09,590 --> 03:18:12,229
What do you think?

1383
03:18:12,229 --> 03:18:13,989
The name is very important here.

1384
03:18:13,989 --> 03:18:16,540
Make him short.

1385
03:18:16,540 --> 03:18:21,319
Five, six.

1386
03:18:21,319 --> 03:18:27,879
The crab?

1387
03:18:27,879 --> 03:18:31,260
What did you say?

1388
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:32,459
Look at...

1389
03:18:32,459 --> 03:18:34,360
He's such a cheater.

1390
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:36,440
No, I'm not going to name this guy Berserker.

1391
03:18:36,440 --> 03:18:42,920
The Berserker.

1392
03:18:58,409 --> 03:19:04,540
Okay, fine.

1393
03:19:04,540 --> 03:19:05,579
Crowd?

1394
03:19:05,579 --> 03:19:06,459
Names?

1395
03:19:06,459 --> 03:19:07,739
Music manager?

1396
03:19:07,739 --> 03:19:10,600
What do you mean, crowd?

1397
03:19:10,600 --> 03:19:11,559
Eat dirt?

1398
03:19:11,559 --> 03:19:12,680
Or, no, loved.

1399
03:19:12,680 --> 03:19:15,260
Do I have a manager?

1400
03:19:15,260 --> 03:19:15,899
Music.

1401
03:19:15,899 --> 03:19:31,879
Wait, can we hear it?

1402
03:19:31,879 --> 03:19:35,180
This is not Hulk Hogan's music.

1403
03:19:35,180 --> 03:19:37,610
This is not even close.

1404
03:19:37,610 --> 03:19:38,569
What is this?

1405
03:19:38,569 --> 03:19:53,719
Are these all just DMCA versions?

1406
03:19:53,719 --> 03:19:56,969
Yeah, they're all royalty-free versions.

1407
03:19:56,969 --> 03:20:15,750
But they're not even close.

1408
03:20:15,750 --> 03:20:16,709
I know...

1409
03:20:16,709 --> 03:20:24,809
I know Bret Hart's music.

1410
03:20:24,809 --> 03:20:28,489
No, it really is royalty-free versions.

1411
03:20:30,149 --> 03:20:32,149
Why would they have the rights to the wrestlers

1412
03:20:32,149 --> 03:20:33,430
but not their entrance musics?

1413
03:20:34,069 --> 03:20:43,670
Somebody said these are iCarly beats?

1414
03:20:45,959 --> 03:20:47,879
iCarly beats?

1415
03:20:47,879 --> 03:21:11,510
It's this no way you're going to convince me

1416
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:14,200
it's not this one.

1417
03:21:14,200 --> 03:21:15,799
This one is so dumb.

1418
03:21:15,799 --> 03:21:20,809
This is Jerry Lawler's music but not...

1419
03:21:20,809 --> 03:21:21,370
It's...

1420
03:21:21,370 --> 03:21:21,850
This is the...

1421
03:21:21,850 --> 03:21:22,409
Okay.

1422
03:21:22,409 --> 03:21:24,489
These are the dream versions of this music.

1423
03:21:26,739 --> 03:21:27,299
Like, that was...

1424
03:21:27,860 --> 03:21:28,819
That was what was playing

1425
03:21:28,819 --> 03:21:30,819
but that's not what was playing in the dream.

1426
03:21:51,049 --> 03:21:52,170
Look at iCarly.

1427
03:21:52,809 --> 03:22:20,709
These are all so good.

1428
03:22:20,709 --> 03:22:21,670
I don't know.

1429
03:22:24,229 --> 03:22:24,790
Wait, hold on.

1430
03:22:24,790 --> 03:22:26,069
We have to hit a drop on this one.

1431
03:22:26,629 --> 03:23:14,649
This is just the intro to Monster Rancher.

1432
03:23:14,649 --> 03:23:20,170
Oh, no, it's not.

1433
03:23:21,620 --> 03:23:21,940
It's...

1434
03:23:22,500 --> 03:23:24,420
It's that song.

1435
03:23:29,579 --> 03:23:30,379
I think I have to go...

1436
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:31,979
Look at how many there is.

1437
03:23:35,829 --> 03:23:37,829
I think I have my choice already.

1438
03:23:38,469 --> 03:23:39,930
This one has lyrics.

1439
03:23:40,569 --> 03:23:49,209
This is Persona music.

1440
03:23:49,850 --> 03:23:52,700
This plays in Persona.

1441
03:23:52,700 --> 03:23:53,739
It's like Persona 5.

1442
03:23:54,459 --> 03:24:19,420
I don't know.

1443
03:24:20,299 --> 03:24:21,819
Our character eats bugs.

1444
03:24:21,819 --> 03:24:23,020
I don't think this is...

1445
03:24:23,020 --> 03:24:23,500
No.

1446
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:39,510
We're at a joint.

1447
03:24:39,510 --> 03:24:41,670
That's been cooking up burgers since 1950.

1448
03:24:42,469 --> 03:24:44,309
Off on the corner of 1st and 2nd Street,

1449
03:24:45,479 --> 03:24:46,040
there's Hank.

1450
03:24:53,209 --> 03:24:53,930
The atmosphere.

1451
03:24:53,930 --> 03:24:54,889
I love the food here.

1452
03:24:54,889 --> 03:24:55,690
It's just so good.

1453
03:24:56,489 --> 03:24:58,969
And we're going to talk about his homemade meatballs.

1454
03:24:59,690 --> 03:25:01,700
Hold on a minute.

1455
03:25:01,700 --> 03:25:01,940
Hold on.

1456
03:25:01,940 --> 03:25:02,739
I have to...

1457
03:25:02,739 --> 03:25:06,709
What is this here, man?

1458
03:25:07,350 --> 03:25:07,829
There it is.

1459
03:25:07,829 --> 03:25:08,069
All right.

1460
03:25:08,069 --> 03:25:08,709
Let me take a bite.

1461
03:25:15,770 --> 03:25:16,409
To the onions.

1462
03:25:16,969 --> 03:25:17,930
When they really get in there

1463
03:25:18,649 --> 03:25:19,290
and you've got the...

1464
03:25:19,290 --> 03:25:19,930
You got the thyme.

1465
03:25:19,930 --> 03:25:21,450
You got the cumin in there too.

1466
03:25:21,450 --> 03:25:22,889
Oh, you knocked out of the park, man.

1467
03:25:22,889 --> 03:25:23,290
Out of the park.

1468
03:25:24,090 --> 03:25:24,969
Killed it.

1469
03:25:24,969 --> 03:25:46,379
This person doesn't have music.

1470
03:25:46,379 --> 03:25:47,100
Oh, yeah, they do.

1471
03:26:13,530 --> 03:26:15,770
I don't want to do any more reality TV shit.

1472
03:26:15,770 --> 03:26:19,129
I'm gonna...

1473
03:26:19,129 --> 03:26:20,489
Now, when you...

1474
03:26:20,489 --> 03:26:21,770
You don't come back here

1475
03:26:21,770 --> 03:26:23,290
and tell me how to run the store.

1476
03:26:24,010 --> 03:26:24,969
Whenever you run a store

1477
03:26:24,969 --> 03:26:26,329
and somebody comes up with an item

1478
03:26:26,329 --> 03:26:28,090
that just looks like it's worth a thousand dollars

1479
03:26:28,090 --> 03:26:29,370
but it could be worth millions.

1480
03:26:29,370 --> 03:26:29,770
This guy...

1481
03:26:31,209 --> 03:26:32,889
This guy came in with a sword.

1482
03:26:33,770 --> 03:26:35,850
I don't want you buying that sword,

1483
03:26:35,850 --> 03:26:36,809
you fucking idiot.

1484
03:26:37,370 --> 03:26:38,250
Hank Chumley.

1485
03:26:38,889 --> 03:26:39,370
Chumley.

1486
03:26:40,090 --> 03:26:41,209
Go get us lunch.

1487
03:26:42,250 --> 03:26:43,610
It's 1230.

1488
03:26:44,409 --> 03:26:49,799
Wait, there's the same song.

1489
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:52,649
Dude, Storage Wars.

1490
03:26:52,649 --> 03:26:53,450
Storage Wars.

1491
03:26:57,639 --> 03:26:59,399
Every so often somebody comes in with an item.

1492
03:26:59,399 --> 03:27:00,680
That floors everybody.

1493
03:27:00,680 --> 03:27:01,879
Wows everybody, you know?

1494
03:27:03,719 --> 03:27:14,219
Wait, that's a one...

1495
03:27:14,219 --> 03:27:14,459
Oh.

1496
03:27:16,340 --> 03:27:18,020
I'm just having fun listening to these songs.

1497
03:27:21,670 --> 03:27:22,870
This is more fun than the game.

1498
03:27:44,280 --> 03:27:44,680
This one...

1499
03:27:44,680 --> 03:27:45,719
I like this one

1500
03:27:45,719 --> 03:27:55,079
but I just want to hear the fucking

1501
03:27:55,079 --> 03:27:57,159
take a bite out of the food diner's drive-ins

1502
03:27:57,159 --> 03:27:58,440
and dive song one more time.

1503
03:28:07,399 --> 03:28:09,159
I think it actually might be the song.

1504
03:28:09,719 --> 03:28:11,079
I think this is the song.

1505
03:28:11,959 --> 03:28:12,280
Right?

1506
03:28:13,750 --> 03:28:14,790
Just make it this one.

1507
03:28:17,959 --> 03:28:19,719
This is the song that plays.

1508
03:28:19,719 --> 03:28:21,000
I think it's the royalty...

1509
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:21,719
I'm...

1510
03:28:21,719 --> 03:28:36,700
Hold on.

1511
03:28:36,700 --> 03:28:37,579
This one...

1512
03:28:37,579 --> 03:28:38,940
It kind of has to be this one

1513
03:28:38,940 --> 03:28:39,979
because if I get hit in the chair

1514
03:28:39,979 --> 03:28:40,860
and get injured...

1515
03:28:41,579 --> 03:28:42,950
If I get hit in the face of the chair

1516
03:28:42,950 --> 03:28:43,750
or the first match...

1517
03:28:44,389 --> 03:29:06,100
Fuck.

1518
03:29:06,100 --> 03:29:06,979
Okay, fine.

1519
03:29:07,540 --> 03:29:10,600
I gotta pee again.

1520
03:29:11,700 --> 03:29:12,899
Let me pee one more time.

1521
03:29:18,420 --> 03:29:18,979
I press...

1522
03:29:18,979 --> 03:29:20,420
Wait, there's this button.

1523
03:29:20,420 --> 03:31:54,309
I have a question.

1524
03:31:54,309 --> 03:31:58,680
Are there more episodes of One Piece

1525
03:31:59,239 --> 03:32:01,000
or diners drive-ins and dives?

1526
03:32:08,379 --> 03:32:17,739
How many episodes of One Piece are there?

1527
03:32:17,739 --> 03:32:18,219
One Piece?

1528
03:32:18,780 --> 03:32:21,319
There are about a thousand.

1529
03:32:21,319 --> 03:32:23,399
There are over a thousand episodes of One Piece.

1530
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:27,159
How many episodes of diners drive-ins and dives are there?

1531
03:32:27,159 --> 03:32:27,879
Are there a thousand?

1532
03:32:35,059 --> 03:32:36,659
There's probably a thousand.

1533
03:32:36,659 --> 03:32:40,860
Google says 419.

1534
03:32:41,659 --> 03:32:43,379
So it's not even close.

1535
03:32:43,379 --> 03:32:43,860
Never mind.

1536
03:32:47,979 --> 03:32:49,579
All right, what about Naruto?

1537
03:32:49,579 --> 03:32:52,139
Are there more episodes of diners drive-ins and dives

1538
03:32:52,139 --> 03:32:52,620
or...

1539
03:32:52,620 --> 03:32:53,420
Don't burn in the screen.

1540
03:32:54,540 --> 03:32:55,100
It's happening.

1541
03:32:55,100 --> 03:32:55,600
I did it.

1542
03:32:56,620 --> 03:32:58,379
Okay.

1543
03:32:59,020 --> 03:33:05,899
It's 700.

1544
03:33:05,899 --> 03:33:06,399
500.

1545
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:16,079
Mail average.

1546
03:33:20,829 --> 03:33:21,870
What was this person's name?

1547
03:33:30,799 --> 03:33:32,620
Crab?

1548
03:33:32,620 --> 03:33:33,819
Just keep mail average.

1549
03:33:48,860 --> 03:33:53,420
Bob Berserker?

1550
03:33:54,059 --> 03:33:59,930
How do you spell Berserk?

1551
03:33:59,930 --> 03:34:04,780
Bob Berserker.

1552
03:34:04,780 --> 03:34:08,989
Is there an R?

1553
03:34:08,989 --> 03:34:10,430
Is it like Berserk?

1554
03:34:10,430 --> 03:34:22,360
Or is it Berserk?

1555
03:34:22,360 --> 03:34:23,079
Bob Berserk.

1556
03:34:23,639 --> 03:34:24,139
Okay.

1557
03:34:24,680 --> 03:34:28,440
Short name.

1558
03:34:29,239 --> 03:34:30,180
Berserker?

1559
03:34:32,159 --> 03:34:47,709
Wait, do we need to...

1560
03:34:48,670 --> 03:34:50,680
Wait, what do you mean the list?

1561
03:34:51,639 --> 03:34:52,600
Does it say the name?

1562
03:34:55,709 --> 03:34:56,750
Wait, does it say these?

1563
03:34:57,469 --> 03:34:57,950
Hold on.

1564
03:35:05,069 --> 03:35:06,510
It definitely says these.

1565
03:35:08,379 --> 03:35:08,940
It's definitely...

1566
03:35:10,700 --> 03:35:11,659
Bruiser!

1567
03:35:11,659 --> 03:35:12,540
Burnout!

1568
03:35:12,540 --> 03:35:13,040
Cabbage!

1569
03:35:13,579 --> 03:35:14,079
Captain!

1570
03:35:14,620 --> 03:35:15,500
Cowboy!

1571
03:35:15,500 --> 03:35:16,540
Oh, you know it does.

1572
03:35:17,260 --> 03:35:18,940
It has to be a Z name?

1573
03:35:32,319 --> 03:35:32,819
Zebra!

1574
03:35:34,239 --> 03:35:34,739
Ugly!

1575
03:35:35,870 --> 03:35:36,370
Weirdo!

1576
03:35:37,639 --> 03:35:38,139
Zap!

1577
03:35:38,600 --> 03:35:39,100
Zodiac!

1578
03:35:42,110 --> 03:35:43,069
Here he is.

1579
03:35:43,069 --> 03:35:43,569
The weirdo!

1580
03:35:45,680 --> 03:35:46,399
Oh, man.

1581
03:35:46,399 --> 03:35:47,440
I'm telling you, Bob.

1582
03:35:47,440 --> 03:35:50,959
The weirdo is having struggling in that corner there.

1583
03:35:50,959 --> 03:35:55,120
Let's hope that the weirdo can get out of this without that many scars.

1584
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:00,319
Middle of name?

1585
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:05,239
Do Uncle Bob.

1586
03:36:07,319 --> 03:36:07,719
Bob.

1587
03:36:07,719 --> 03:36:08,360
Uncle Bob.

1588
03:36:08,360 --> 03:36:09,000
Uncle Bob.

1589
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:09,639
Uncle Bob.

1590
03:36:09,639 --> 03:36:10,360
Uncle Bob.

1591
03:36:10,360 --> 03:36:11,639
All right, all right, all right.

1592
03:36:12,440 --> 03:36:13,159
Uncle Bob.

1593
03:36:14,459 --> 03:36:15,420
Uncle Bob.

1594
03:36:15,420 --> 03:36:16,620
Bob Berserker?

1595
03:36:19,309 --> 03:36:20,750
No, not Uncle Bob.

1596
03:36:22,590 --> 03:36:23,090
Shit.

1597
03:36:24,049 --> 03:36:27,329
Okay, that's good.

1598
03:36:30,030 --> 03:36:30,670
Finisher.

1599
03:36:30,670 --> 03:36:31,790
The Double Roundhouse.

1600
03:36:32,510 --> 03:36:34,750
Does it matter?

1601
03:36:40,700 --> 03:37:03,739
The music is very loud.

1602
03:37:03,739 --> 03:37:04,239
The...

1603
03:37:05,809 --> 03:37:06,309
The...

1604
03:37:08,129 --> 03:37:08,850
The Grinder.

1605
03:37:11,139 --> 03:37:11,459
The...

1606
03:37:11,459 --> 03:37:12,180
The Crusher.

1607
03:37:12,739 --> 03:37:14,020
The Smoosher.

1608
03:37:16,639 --> 03:37:17,840
I'm not calling it that.

1609
03:37:21,139 --> 03:37:22,819
The Stern Talk!

1610
03:37:22,819 --> 03:37:23,540
I like that.

1611
03:37:24,510 --> 03:37:25,229
I love...

1612
03:37:25,229 --> 03:37:26,909
The Stern Talk.

1613
03:37:26,909 --> 03:37:27,389
What is that?

1614
03:37:27,389 --> 03:37:27,950
What is that?

1615
03:37:28,670 --> 03:37:30,159
Imagine if you just like...

1616
03:37:30,719 --> 03:37:41,629
I like it.

1617
03:37:41,629 --> 03:37:42,110
Hometown.

1618
03:37:44,129 --> 03:37:44,610
I don't know.

1619
03:37:44,610 --> 03:37:45,649
Fucking L.A.

1620
03:37:46,959 --> 03:37:47,459
Where...

1621
03:37:48,079 --> 03:37:50,700
Who cares?

1622
03:37:51,420 --> 03:37:56,559
All right.

1623
03:37:57,620 --> 03:37:58,420
I don't want a manager.

1624
03:38:05,540 --> 03:38:08,670
I did save it when I came right back that first time.

1625
03:38:09,309 --> 03:38:10,129
Let's do it again.

1626
03:38:14,940 --> 03:38:18,219
I made sure before I took off because I was scared that something might go wrong.

1627
03:38:28,180 --> 03:38:29,059
Oh my goodness.

1628
03:38:29,059 --> 03:38:30,180
I forgot what it looked like.

1629
03:38:31,059 --> 03:38:31,299
All right.

1630
03:38:31,299 --> 03:38:32,020
Are you guys ready?

1631
03:38:33,620 --> 03:38:34,260
It's time.

1632
03:38:34,819 --> 03:38:37,709
It's time.

1633
03:38:38,670 --> 03:38:39,069
Career.

1634
03:38:39,709 --> 03:38:59,040
Where's the...

1635
03:38:59,040 --> 03:38:59,760
Where's the character?

1636
03:39:00,399 --> 03:39:02,540
Did it need to be a legend?

1637
03:39:06,530 --> 03:39:06,850
Okay.

1638
03:39:06,850 --> 03:39:07,090
Good.

1639
03:39:14,219 --> 03:39:14,620
Okay.

1640
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:15,260
Let's go for it.

1641
03:39:15,819 --> 03:39:17,889
Pick a region.

1642
03:39:19,620 --> 03:39:20,180
Las Vegas.

1643
03:39:20,180 --> 03:39:20,579
Of course.

1644
03:39:23,409 --> 03:39:23,889
Options.

1645
03:39:25,090 --> 03:39:25,649
Costume.

1646
03:39:26,370 --> 03:39:27,170
Advice on.

1647
03:39:28,049 --> 03:39:28,690
Okay.

1648
03:39:28,690 --> 03:39:33,139
All right.

1649
03:39:33,139 --> 03:39:34,180
We're going down here.

1650
03:39:34,180 --> 03:39:36,350
Let's go.

1651
03:39:39,459 --> 03:39:39,860
Dallas.

1652
03:39:40,579 --> 03:39:43,549
Yes.

1653
03:39:43,549 --> 03:39:44,989
I wish to load wrestler one.

1654
03:40:04,139 --> 03:40:04,639
Why?

1655
03:40:05,579 --> 03:40:11,870
I thought I didn't have a manager.

1656
03:40:12,430 --> 03:40:24,750
Where's my...

1657
03:40:24,750 --> 03:40:25,549
What was my music?

1658
03:40:25,549 --> 03:40:26,190
Did I have it?

1659
03:40:32,620 --> 03:40:33,500
I don't even know how to play.

1660
03:40:44,959 --> 03:40:45,520
Wait.

1661
03:40:46,819 --> 03:40:57,059
I'm not even playing.

1662
03:40:57,059 --> 03:40:58,579
Why am I not playing?

1663
03:41:22,420 --> 03:41:23,780
Uncle Bob.

1664
03:41:23,780 --> 03:41:25,059
Bob Berserker.

1665
03:41:25,620 --> 03:41:47,549
Are we going to do this for everybody?

1666
03:41:49,379 --> 03:41:50,659
Everybody's going to get one of these.

1667
03:41:53,010 --> 03:41:53,409
All right.

1668
03:41:53,409 --> 03:41:54,850
I'm skipping the rest of these people.

1669
03:41:56,129 --> 03:41:57,010
Is it Aquaman?

1670
03:42:08,610 --> 03:42:09,729
Don't skip.

1671
03:42:09,729 --> 03:42:16,620
So what's the match?

1672
03:42:16,620 --> 03:42:28,030
Are we just going to hang out and just...

1673
03:42:28,030 --> 03:42:28,350
Shit.

1674
03:42:29,069 --> 03:42:31,149
This camera angle is so bad.

1675
03:42:32,340 --> 03:42:33,139
How do I fight?

1676
03:42:40,340 --> 03:42:41,219
Oh, shit.

1677
03:42:44,260 --> 03:42:44,579
What?

1678
03:42:52,860 --> 03:42:54,299
Did I lose that fast?

1679
03:42:57,889 --> 03:42:59,569
Aquaman was doing the same face.

1680
03:43:04,290 --> 03:43:05,250
Boring moves.

1681
03:43:06,129 --> 03:43:07,250
Ignored your partner.

1682
03:43:08,290 --> 03:43:09,409
Minimal combos.

1683
03:43:10,770 --> 03:43:12,370
Zero percent popularity.

1684
03:43:28,670 --> 03:43:30,100
Okay.

1685
03:43:30,100 --> 03:43:32,120
Good.

1686
03:43:35,739 --> 03:43:37,659
I guess we're staying here.

1687
03:43:38,379 --> 03:43:50,530
I'm telling you.

1688
03:43:50,530 --> 03:43:51,729
Buttons didn't do anything.

1689
03:43:53,329 --> 03:43:54,129
I pressed X.

1690
03:43:54,129 --> 03:43:54,850
I pressed Y.

1691
03:43:54,850 --> 03:43:55,569
I pressed V.

1692
03:43:55,569 --> 03:43:57,010
I pressed the trigger buttons.

1693
03:43:57,010 --> 03:43:58,290
Nothing seemed to do anything.

1694
03:43:58,850 --> 03:44:05,219
Why are they booing me?

1695
03:44:05,219 --> 03:44:06,500
I'm supposed to be a fan favorite.

1696
03:44:33,920 --> 03:44:35,120
Why are they booing me?

1697
03:44:35,680 --> 03:45:02,639
Okay.

1698
03:45:02,639 --> 03:45:05,629
Let's not lose immediately, please.

1699
03:45:06,430 --> 03:45:16,270
I did a move.

1700
03:45:16,270 --> 03:45:16,750
I did a move.

1701
03:45:23,790 --> 03:45:24,430
Oh, shit.

1702
03:45:24,989 --> 03:45:30,979
Extreme damage.

1703
03:45:44,989 --> 03:45:46,670
We're playing on concrete right now.

1704
03:45:46,670 --> 03:45:48,350
There was no give to this ring.

1705
03:45:48,350 --> 03:45:59,540
Shit.

1706
03:46:00,180 --> 03:46:37,379
How did you do the same move?

1707
03:46:37,379 --> 03:46:37,780
How do I...

1708
03:46:37,780 --> 03:46:38,659
I want to get out of the ring.

1709
03:46:45,870 --> 03:46:47,389
That's got to hurt with an arm that big.

1710
03:46:47,950 --> 03:46:53,569
How do I climb the top?

1711
03:46:56,620 --> 03:47:29,170
Let go.

1712
03:47:29,170 --> 03:47:30,690
I think it's like a fighting game.

1713
03:47:30,690 --> 03:47:32,209
I think I have to do like down...

1714
03:47:32,770 --> 03:47:33,889
Like left down up.

1715
03:47:33,889 --> 03:47:34,370
Left down up.

1716
03:47:34,370 --> 03:47:34,770
Hey.

1717
03:47:34,770 --> 03:47:51,969
Left down up clicks.

1718
03:47:51,969 --> 03:47:52,290
Nice.

1719
03:48:03,889 --> 03:48:04,370
Oh, shit.

1720
03:48:04,370 --> 03:48:05,170
They don't like it.

1721
03:48:06,450 --> 03:48:07,969
They are actually pissed.

1722
03:48:08,610 --> 03:48:20,270
Uh-oh.

1723
03:48:20,270 --> 03:48:27,680
Where are you going?

1724
03:48:27,680 --> 03:48:28,180
Uh-oh.

1725
03:48:29,659 --> 03:48:30,139
How do I run?

1726
03:48:30,139 --> 03:48:30,700
How do I run away?

1727
03:48:30,700 --> 03:48:31,180
How do I run?

1728
03:48:31,180 --> 03:48:31,579
How do I run?

1729
03:48:31,579 --> 03:48:32,059
How do I run?

1730
03:48:32,059 --> 03:48:32,780
How do I pick that up?

1731
03:48:33,340 --> 03:48:36,590
Pick that up.

1732
03:48:36,590 --> 03:48:37,069
How do I pick it up?

1733
03:48:37,069 --> 03:48:37,309
Pick it up.

1734
03:48:37,309 --> 03:48:37,549
Pick it up.

1735
03:48:37,549 --> 03:48:37,790
Pick it up.

1736
03:48:37,790 --> 03:48:38,030
Pick it up.

1737
03:48:38,030 --> 03:48:38,510
Pick that up.

1738
03:48:39,549 --> 03:48:42,610
How do I pick...

1739
03:48:47,969 --> 03:48:49,409
How do I pick the chair up?

1740
03:48:54,430 --> 03:48:55,549
Oh, I am fucked here.

1741
03:48:55,549 --> 03:48:55,950
It's over.

1742
03:48:55,950 --> 03:48:56,909
There's no way I'm getting up.

1743
03:49:06,530 --> 03:49:06,770
No.

1744
03:49:07,329 --> 03:49:22,379
My goodness.

1745
03:49:23,790 --> 03:49:24,510
I'm dead.

1746
03:49:24,510 --> 03:49:25,309
I'm not getting up.

1747
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:34,079
Run.

1748
03:49:34,079 --> 03:49:34,559
Run away.

1749
03:49:34,559 --> 03:49:35,040
Run away.

1750
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:35,440
Run away.

1751
03:49:35,440 --> 03:49:35,840
Run away.

1752
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:36,239
Run away.

1753
03:49:36,239 --> 03:49:43,299
Run away.

1754
03:49:43,299 --> 03:49:43,940
Oh, my God.

1755
03:49:43,940 --> 03:49:44,899
It's so hard to control.

1756
03:49:45,620 --> 03:49:46,260
I want that chair.

1757
03:49:46,260 --> 03:49:46,979
Give it to me.

1758
03:49:46,979 --> 03:49:48,459
Pick it up.

1759
03:49:48,459 --> 03:50:02,750
How do you pick up?

1760
03:50:06,690 --> 03:50:07,969
There's no move list.

1761
03:50:07,969 --> 03:50:14,610
I'm trying to...

1762
03:50:14,610 --> 03:50:16,690
I'm trying every single combination I'm trying.

1763
03:50:16,690 --> 03:50:17,170
I swear.

1764
03:50:21,700 --> 03:50:23,299
I want the chair so bad.

1765
03:50:23,299 --> 03:50:24,100
You have no idea.

1766
03:50:34,659 --> 03:50:35,059
No.

1767
03:50:35,059 --> 03:50:36,340
Pick the chair up.

1768
03:50:37,299 --> 03:50:38,420
Pick the chair up.

1769
03:50:39,569 --> 03:50:44,829
Pick the chair up.

1770
03:50:44,829 --> 03:50:46,430
How do you pick up the chair?

1771
03:51:02,270 --> 03:51:02,510
L?

1772
03:51:09,979 --> 03:51:22,430
I'm pressing L.

1773
03:51:22,430 --> 03:51:23,229
Up on the D-pad.

1774
03:51:23,229 --> 03:51:23,790
D-pad up.

1775
03:51:34,219 --> 03:51:35,579
Get more weapons.

1776
03:51:35,579 --> 03:51:44,700
Ow.

1777
03:51:44,700 --> 03:51:45,420
No, give that to me.

1778
03:51:46,860 --> 03:51:48,139
I'm nothing without my weapon.

1779
03:51:48,700 --> 03:51:59,360
Give me the weapon.

1780
03:51:59,360 --> 03:51:59,920
Give me a weapon.

1781
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:01,040
I need a weapon.

1782
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:02,159
Give me a weapon.

1783
03:52:02,159 --> 03:52:03,680
It's an exciting match at least.

1784
03:52:04,479 --> 03:52:10,819
Why is he up immediately?

1785
03:52:17,229 --> 03:52:17,790
Get off me.

1786
03:52:18,190 --> 03:52:37,790
This chair is huge.

1787
03:52:38,829 --> 03:52:43,250
Leave me the fuck alone.

1788
03:52:44,049 --> 03:52:44,450
No.

1789
03:52:44,450 --> 03:52:49,069
Stop it.

1790
03:52:49,790 --> 03:52:53,809
Dude, his ass is insane.

1791
03:52:54,770 --> 03:52:55,250
What do you...

1792
03:52:55,250 --> 03:52:57,100
Oh.

1793
03:52:58,059 --> 03:53:04,719
I need a weapon.

1794
03:53:04,719 --> 03:53:05,280
Please.

1795
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:06,479
All right.

1796
03:53:06,479 --> 03:53:09,729
I have a guitar.

1797
03:53:10,450 --> 03:53:10,930
Uh-oh.

1798
03:53:15,120 --> 03:53:15,680
Oh, shit.

1799
03:53:15,680 --> 03:53:16,000
Oh, my God.

1800
03:53:16,000 --> 03:53:16,399
Oh, my God.

1801
03:53:16,399 --> 03:53:16,799
Oh, my God.

1802
03:53:16,799 --> 03:53:17,120
Oh, my God.

1803
03:53:17,120 --> 03:53:17,440
Oh, my God.

1804
03:53:17,440 --> 03:53:17,840
Oh, my God.

1805
03:53:17,840 --> 03:53:18,159
Oh, my God.

1806
03:53:18,159 --> 03:53:18,319
Oh, my God.

1807
03:53:18,319 --> 03:53:18,799
Oh, my God.

1808
03:53:18,799 --> 03:53:19,120
I got it.

1809
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:20,540
I got it.

1810
03:53:20,540 --> 03:53:20,780
I got it.

1811
03:53:20,780 --> 03:53:21,180
I got it.

1812
03:53:21,180 --> 03:53:21,340
I got it.

1813
03:53:21,340 --> 03:53:21,579
I got it.

1814
03:53:21,579 --> 03:53:21,899
I got it.

1815
03:53:21,899 --> 03:53:22,379
Wait.

1816
03:53:22,379 --> 03:53:26,750
Yeah, I can throw this?

1817
03:53:27,309 --> 03:53:43,010
Everybody loves it.

1818
03:53:43,010 --> 03:53:45,090
This is the greatest match they've ever been to.

1819
03:53:46,129 --> 03:53:51,600
Wait.

1820
03:53:51,760 --> 03:53:52,000
Wait.

1821
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:52,239
Wait.

1822
03:53:53,840 --> 03:53:54,399
Pick it up.

1823
03:53:55,940 --> 03:53:56,340
Ow.

1824
03:54:00,770 --> 03:54:01,569
Oh, I blocked it.

1825
03:54:31,940 --> 03:54:32,659
Give me a weapon.

1826
03:54:32,659 --> 03:54:33,059
Hurry.

1827
03:54:54,399 --> 03:54:55,280
What the hell is this?

1828
03:55:05,659 --> 03:55:06,620
Should I pin him?

1829
03:55:25,520 --> 03:55:27,520
Dude, his health is transparent right now.

1830
03:55:27,520 --> 03:55:45,819
He has no health bar.

1831
03:55:45,819 --> 03:56:01,950
He's out?

1832
03:56:01,950 --> 03:56:05,069
He has, like, a little cut on his forehead.

1833
03:56:08,399 --> 03:56:09,520
Dude, look at this excitement.

1834
03:56:09,520 --> 03:56:10,559
159%.

1835
03:56:13,200 --> 03:56:34,079
Oh, look at this popularity.

1836
03:56:34,079 --> 03:56:35,040
This game is great.

1837
03:56:35,780 --> 03:56:36,340
Yeah.

1838
03:56:36,340 --> 03:56:37,540
I mean, it's not fun.

1839
03:56:38,100 --> 03:56:40,420
It's not very good, but it is at the same time.

1840
03:56:41,219 --> 03:56:42,500
It's actually pretty good.

1841
03:56:43,219 --> 03:56:50,500
Oh, yeah.

1842
03:56:50,500 --> 03:57:06,100
We're in Vegas and we're going to a joint tag team.

1843
03:57:06,659 --> 03:57:12,459
Is that a gun?

1844
03:57:13,020 --> 03:57:15,200
Oh, no.

1845
03:57:15,200 --> 03:57:15,600
Is it?

1846
03:57:16,899 --> 03:57:17,379
No.

1847
03:57:17,379 --> 03:57:17,860
What is it?

1848
03:57:18,420 --> 03:57:21,149
It's a gun.

1849
03:57:56,620 --> 03:58:03,870
Rob Van Dam.

1850
03:58:03,870 --> 03:58:04,989
Bob and Rob.

1851
03:58:04,989 --> 03:58:25,120
Are we going to fight this guy?

1852
03:58:53,409 --> 03:58:54,209
Not this again.

1853
03:58:54,930 --> 03:58:56,129
Wait, I'm cheating.

1854
03:58:56,129 --> 03:58:58,979
Why does it say cheat?

1855
03:59:08,110 --> 03:59:08,989
How do I cheat?

1856
03:59:08,989 --> 03:59:27,940
Holy shit.

1857
03:59:27,940 --> 03:59:29,059
How do I turn?

1858
03:59:29,059 --> 04:00:04,700
Hey.

1859
04:00:04,700 --> 04:00:07,840
Wait, tag.

1860
04:00:07,840 --> 04:00:08,639
Tag in.

1861
04:00:08,639 --> 04:00:24,059
Tag in.

1862
04:00:24,059 --> 04:00:25,020
Oh, shit.

1863
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:40,379
We're in.

1864
04:00:40,379 --> 04:00:40,879
Uh-oh.

1865
04:00:54,260 --> 04:00:55,219
Pick the weapon up.

1866
04:01:12,350 --> 04:01:25,149
What?

1867
04:01:25,149 --> 04:01:38,670
Oh, I blocked it.

1868
04:01:38,670 --> 04:01:40,260
Tag.

1869
04:01:40,260 --> 04:02:13,010
Tag, you idiot.

1870
04:02:13,010 --> 04:02:13,409
Pin.

1871
04:02:13,409 --> 04:02:13,909
Pin.

1872
04:02:16,139 --> 04:02:16,639
Pin him.

1873
04:02:23,520 --> 04:02:26,500
No, shit.

1874
04:02:26,500 --> 04:02:35,149
Tag in.

1875
04:02:35,149 --> 04:02:35,549
All right.

1876
04:02:35,549 --> 04:02:36,270
Tag in.

1877
04:02:36,270 --> 04:02:45,780
Let's do it.

1878
04:02:51,329 --> 04:02:53,329
He punched his own brother.

1879
04:02:53,329 --> 04:02:55,010
Why can I hit two of them together?

1880
04:02:55,649 --> 04:02:56,690
Why is the rev out?

1881
04:03:08,379 --> 04:03:08,780
All right.

1882
04:03:08,780 --> 04:03:09,020
Pin.

1883
04:03:09,819 --> 04:03:18,510
Turn around and look at this guy.

1884
04:03:20,379 --> 04:03:21,819
Stop looking at the other guy

1885
04:03:21,819 --> 04:03:23,420
and look at the guy fighting in the ring.

1886
04:03:24,219 --> 04:03:41,700
Oh, shit.

1887
04:03:41,700 --> 04:03:43,020
Get him.

1888
04:03:43,020 --> 04:03:45,979
Get him.

1889
04:03:45,979 --> 04:03:47,020
Oh, my God.

1890
04:03:47,020 --> 04:03:48,459
That's a dangerous move.

1891
04:03:54,579 --> 04:03:54,899
All right.

1892
04:03:54,899 --> 04:03:55,620
Get in here.

1893
04:03:57,139 --> 04:03:57,860
And I need to get it.

1894
04:03:57,860 --> 04:03:59,139
I need to pin you.

1895
04:03:59,139 --> 04:04:11,069
His body is lifeless.

1896
04:04:11,709 --> 04:04:16,510
My God.

1897
04:04:19,780 --> 04:04:20,500
Okay.

1898
04:04:20,500 --> 04:04:20,739
Pin.

1899
04:04:21,379 --> 04:04:22,420
What's the pin button?

1900
04:04:23,139 --> 04:04:34,159
Yeah, I could use your help right now.

1901
04:04:34,879 --> 04:04:35,840
No, just take your time.

1902
04:04:35,840 --> 04:04:36,239
Don't worry.

1903
04:04:36,239 --> 04:04:36,719
I got both.

1904
04:04:47,409 --> 04:04:49,010
I pressed every single button.

1905
04:04:49,569 --> 04:04:59,090
What's he doing?

1906
04:05:04,899 --> 04:05:09,940
Pin.

1907
04:05:09,940 --> 04:05:10,739
Oh, my God.

1908
04:05:10,739 --> 04:05:12,100
That was a centimeter.

1909
04:05:46,780 --> 04:05:48,219
No excitement, Andy.

1910
04:06:16,559 --> 04:06:18,000
I tried to tag the partner.

1911
04:06:18,000 --> 04:06:18,559
It didn't work.

1912
04:06:20,479 --> 04:06:25,020
You're going for a no pin run.

1913
04:06:25,899 --> 04:06:28,750
I mean, I'm going for a maybe one more match

1914
04:06:28,750 --> 04:06:29,549
before we move on.

1915
04:06:30,430 --> 04:06:33,069
This is too much in my brain right now.

1916
04:06:37,760 --> 04:06:39,520
It's D-pad plus X.

1917
04:06:40,159 --> 04:06:45,950
There's a QTE on the health bar to cheat.

1918
04:06:46,590 --> 04:07:06,299
Wait, what did I do?

1919
04:07:06,299 --> 04:07:26,209
Oh, it's the iron cheek.

1920
04:07:26,209 --> 04:07:31,860
Okay.

1921
04:07:31,860 --> 04:07:33,860
Why am I against two people?

1922
04:07:33,860 --> 04:07:53,520
Oh, wait, I get it.

1923
04:07:53,520 --> 04:07:59,760
I see what you mean.

1924
04:07:59,760 --> 04:08:01,200
I have to time it.

1925
04:08:01,200 --> 04:08:02,180
I get it.

1926
04:08:02,180 --> 04:08:16,819
How do I do a finishing move?

1927
04:08:16,819 --> 04:08:32,719
How is this not exciting?

1928
04:08:32,719 --> 04:08:54,530
That's never not going to be funny.

1929
04:08:54,530 --> 04:09:17,700
That was sick.

1930
04:09:17,700 --> 04:09:39,420
You need to cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat.

1931
04:09:39,420 --> 04:09:39,899
What?

1932
04:09:39,899 --> 04:09:53,540
Of course, I bring out the weapon

1933
04:09:53,540 --> 04:09:54,500
and all of a sudden everybody thinks

1934
04:09:54,500 --> 04:09:59,180
the match is cool again.

1935
04:09:59,180 --> 04:09:59,819
Look at that.

1936
04:09:59,819 --> 04:10:01,680
I brought out the weapon.

1937
04:10:01,680 --> 04:10:03,360
I got 30% excitement meter.

1938
04:10:04,860 --> 04:10:06,299
Dude, you should hit the ref.

1939
04:10:06,299 --> 04:10:08,219
I think I did accidentally.

1940
04:10:20,479 --> 04:10:25,680
Huge power bomb.

1941
04:10:25,680 --> 04:10:26,159
Oh, hold on.

1942
04:10:26,159 --> 04:10:27,040
Grab him.

1943
04:10:27,040 --> 04:10:37,680
Hit him.

1944
04:10:37,680 --> 04:10:38,479
Stop winning.

1945
04:10:39,200 --> 04:10:55,680
You don't get up immediately from that shit.

1946
04:10:55,680 --> 04:10:56,239
Come on, dude.

1947
04:11:12,450 --> 04:11:13,729
Stop reversing that.

1948
04:11:14,450 --> 04:11:22,370
Why do they just cut to that guy?

1949
04:11:23,170 --> 04:11:25,040
All right, I got to get it.

1950
04:11:25,040 --> 04:11:25,680
He's going to get it.

1951
04:11:25,680 --> 04:11:26,319
He's got a weapon.

1952
04:11:41,860 --> 04:11:42,819
You like that dodge?

1953
04:11:49,459 --> 04:11:50,340
Reverse it.

1954
04:11:50,340 --> 04:12:06,530
Hit him.

1955
04:12:06,530 --> 04:12:07,250
Get him.

1956
04:12:07,250 --> 04:12:13,500
How are you doing a one count

1957
04:12:13,500 --> 04:12:14,379
after a move like that?

1958
04:12:21,840 --> 04:12:41,040
Shit, it's got to be it.

1959
04:12:41,040 --> 04:12:43,120
Why are you doing it like that every time?

1960
04:12:45,780 --> 04:12:47,059
Just pin him regular.

1961
04:12:47,059 --> 04:12:47,860
Pin him normally.

1962
04:13:00,979 --> 04:13:02,420
What is going on right now?

1963
04:13:02,420 --> 04:13:03,059
Look at his health.

1964
04:13:05,409 --> 04:13:05,969
I've had enough.

1965
04:13:36,719 --> 04:13:38,479
It's so stupid.

1966
04:13:38,479 --> 04:13:42,209
The ref is speaking Simlish.

1967
04:13:47,200 --> 04:13:48,239
He had to flex.

1968
04:13:49,120 --> 04:14:11,010
Reverse.

1969
04:14:11,010 --> 04:14:43,309
I can't hit him.

1970
04:14:52,110 --> 04:15:04,989
I need to win one by a pin.

1971
04:15:04,989 --> 04:15:12,319
Dude has zero health.

1972
04:15:12,319 --> 04:15:14,399
I just have to knock everybody out.

1973
04:15:14,399 --> 04:15:18,530
Oh my God.

1974
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:24,799
That was a big excitement match.

1975
04:15:28,420 --> 04:15:31,469
All right, I'm moving on.

1976
04:15:31,469 --> 04:15:32,510
This was too much.

1977
04:15:32,510 --> 04:15:34,829
That was a great one though.

1978
04:15:34,829 --> 04:15:36,909
Two back to back great ones in a row.

1979
04:15:37,790 --> 04:15:39,629
Although I do want to see one thing though.

1980
04:15:40,430 --> 04:15:43,969
I want to see something.

1981
04:15:44,770 --> 04:15:48,879
Okay, versus four way tag team arena.

1982
04:15:48,879 --> 04:15:49,520
Arena.

1983
04:15:52,510 --> 04:15:54,350
I'm just checking to see if there's any other game modes, all right?

1984
04:15:55,389 --> 04:15:56,590
Like four way dance.

1985
04:16:03,120 --> 04:16:03,920
Yeah, I think that's it.

1986
04:16:07,680 --> 04:16:08,319
Very limited.

1987
04:16:09,540 --> 04:16:10,579
There's no Royal Rumble.

1988
04:16:11,870 --> 04:16:13,469
All right, it's time for you to vote.

1989
04:16:14,110 --> 04:16:20,079
Are we playing Obi-Wan or Cold Fear?

1990
04:16:20,719 --> 04:16:24,350
You get to vote.

1991
04:16:24,350 --> 04:16:25,469
Obi-Wan or Cold Fear?

1992
04:16:26,110 --> 04:16:32,260
Please vote.

1993
04:16:32,260 --> 04:16:35,120
I don't know.

1994
04:16:35,120 --> 04:16:37,600
We've been sticking on the Xbox games a little longer.

1995
04:16:38,159 --> 04:16:40,670
There's been some quality stuff here.

1996
04:16:40,670 --> 04:16:44,190
It's going to be close.

1997
04:16:47,790 --> 04:16:49,950
It's 43 to 57.

1998
04:16:49,950 --> 04:16:51,790
This could, I'm going to have to wait for a second.

1999
04:16:56,930 --> 04:16:59,569
Uh, Star Wars fans are losing out here, I think.

2000
04:17:05,469 --> 04:17:07,069
Cold Fear, I think, is running away with it.

2001
04:17:07,709 --> 04:17:15,139
Somebody said Obi-Wan is haha funny.

2002
04:17:15,700 --> 04:17:17,329
Cold Fear is a horror game.

2003
04:17:18,049 --> 04:17:21,489
Well, do you want a haha funny Star Wars game or do you want a horror game?

2004
04:17:22,129 --> 04:17:22,930
It's up to you.

2005
04:17:28,350 --> 04:17:29,950
Uh, looks like it's going to be Cold Fear.

2006
04:17:37,120 --> 04:17:38,479
Okay, now that's it.

2007
04:17:38,479 --> 04:17:39,920
That was close, but that's it.

2008
04:17:41,219 --> 04:17:42,420
45 to 55.

2009
04:17:42,979 --> 04:17:43,299
Close.

2010
04:17:54,940 --> 04:17:58,719
This game's on PC, isn't it?

2011
04:17:58,719 --> 04:18:01,280
One of those games that, I think it's on PC.

2012
04:18:01,840 --> 04:18:06,850
But it doesn't really work.

2013
04:18:06,850 --> 04:18:08,700
I feel like I tried to play this on PC.

2014
04:18:08,700 --> 04:18:09,579
Maybe not.

2015
04:18:09,579 --> 04:18:09,979
Did I?

2016
04:18:11,020 --> 04:18:11,979
Did I play this before?

2017
04:18:14,829 --> 04:18:15,389
Lights off.

2018
04:18:16,770 --> 04:18:20,780
Okay.

2019
04:18:20,780 --> 04:18:22,690
Okay.

2020
04:18:22,690 --> 04:18:39,260
I'll do it.

2021
04:18:39,260 --> 04:18:42,559
That, just auto exposure.

2022
04:18:43,600 --> 04:18:44,559
It got brighter.

2023
04:18:46,829 --> 04:18:47,229
Hold on.

2024
04:19:02,209 --> 04:19:03,409
How did it get brighter?

2025
04:19:03,409 --> 04:19:10,770
Hold on a second.

2026
04:19:10,770 --> 04:19:28,719
It's because I have auto exposure on.

2027
04:19:28,719 --> 04:19:29,780
There we go.

2028
04:19:29,780 --> 04:19:30,260
That's better.

2029
04:19:30,260 --> 04:19:38,590
That's what it actually looks like in here.

2030
04:19:38,590 --> 04:19:41,780
Is this actually scary?

2031
04:19:41,780 --> 04:19:43,459
Or are you just memeing on me?

2032
04:19:43,459 --> 04:19:51,299
All right, let's go.

2033
04:20:01,120 --> 04:20:03,360
Extreme to be what?

2034
04:20:03,360 --> 04:20:35,659
All right, be quiet.

2035
04:20:35,659 --> 04:20:40,049
How do you look like you're in a part of Mexico in a Netflix series?

2036
04:20:40,049 --> 04:21:00,239
You can see how, like, sweaty my face is.

2037
04:21:00,239 --> 04:21:17,020
I'm not getting anything here.

2038
04:21:18,139 --> 04:21:19,020
Marcus.

2039
04:21:19,020 --> 04:21:19,739
Law.

2040
04:21:19,739 --> 04:21:20,700
Can you hear me?

2041
04:21:20,700 --> 04:21:23,520
Somebody, absolutely.

2042
04:21:23,520 --> 04:21:24,479
Is anybody alive?

2043
04:21:24,479 --> 04:21:30,930
I'll get me another asset of their product.

2044
04:21:30,930 --> 04:21:31,649
Anything we've got.

2045
04:21:32,909 --> 04:21:33,469
Anything.

2046
04:21:33,469 --> 04:21:37,219
Does this have tank controls?

2047
04:21:37,219 --> 04:21:42,209
It's a tank control game.

2048
04:21:42,209 --> 04:21:43,250
I'm taking it out of this.

2049
04:21:43,250 --> 04:21:44,129
This is the USS Ravenswood.

2050
04:21:44,129 --> 04:21:46,209
We arrived at the vicinity of the vessel

2051
04:21:46,209 --> 04:21:48,850
and will now initiate a search patrol and look for it.

2052
04:21:48,850 --> 04:21:49,649
Ravenswood out.

2053
04:21:49,649 --> 04:21:51,250
Yes, of course it has tank controls.

2054
04:21:51,250 --> 04:21:51,969
Are you serious?

2055
04:21:52,209 --> 04:21:54,909
This is a granny like?

2056
04:21:54,909 --> 04:21:56,190
I don't think it's a granny like.

2057
04:21:57,840 --> 04:21:59,040
It's tank controls.

2058
04:21:59,840 --> 04:22:00,479
God damn it.

2059
04:22:00,479 --> 04:22:05,680
It's a survival horror game between 1992 and 2003.

2060
04:22:06,399 --> 04:22:07,120
Of course.

2061
04:22:07,120 --> 04:22:07,920
What am I thinking?

2062
04:22:07,920 --> 04:22:09,760
Of course it's going to be a tank control game.

2063
04:22:09,760 --> 04:22:10,719
Am I out of my mind?

2064
04:22:42,750 --> 04:22:45,229
Uh, not tank controls, by the way.

2065
04:22:46,190 --> 04:22:47,069
Not tank controls.

2066
04:22:49,360 --> 04:22:51,680
Already, already much cooler.

2067
04:22:52,479 --> 04:22:56,909
My image running is not suspended thing.

2068
04:22:57,469 --> 04:22:58,350
Combat systems are better.

2069
04:22:58,350 --> 04:23:00,590
They also put their downed hummers

2070
04:23:00,590 --> 04:23:01,790
and potential source of ammo in mid-kits.

2071
04:23:02,590 --> 04:23:04,989
You use the butt of your rifle in close combat systems

2072
04:23:04,989 --> 04:23:06,430
and only do the gain the necessary distance

2073
04:23:06,430 --> 04:23:07,069
to adjust your aim.

2074
04:23:07,870 --> 04:23:10,000
Your opponents will attempt to immobilize you.

2075
04:23:10,000 --> 04:23:11,680
Do not simply empty your foot.

2076
04:23:11,680 --> 04:23:12,719
Drag out of them, refer to yourself,

2077
04:23:12,719 --> 04:23:13,760
and shoot at point blank range.

2078
04:23:13,760 --> 04:23:14,639
This is generally how I respect it.

2079
04:23:15,280 --> 04:23:15,889
Okay.

2080
04:23:16,530 --> 04:23:18,239
All right.

2081
04:23:18,959 --> 04:23:19,700
Okay.

2082
04:23:28,739 --> 04:23:31,379
Legends of wrestling has burnt into the top of the screen

2083
04:23:31,379 --> 04:23:32,659
and it's ruining my immersion.

2084
04:23:33,459 --> 04:23:52,909
How do I run?

2085
04:23:53,469 --> 04:23:58,370
This is actually kind of cool.

2086
04:24:02,530 --> 04:24:02,850
Whoa.

2087
04:24:03,649 --> 04:24:10,540
This is not tank controls.

2088
04:24:10,540 --> 04:24:12,379
This actually seems like it's going to be pretty awesome.

2089
04:24:13,180 --> 04:24:29,020
What am I supposed to do?

2090
04:24:45,520 --> 04:24:46,399
Ammo.

2091
04:24:46,399 --> 04:25:10,659
There's a monster right there.

2092
04:25:10,659 --> 04:25:20,879
I have fully loaded ammo.

2093
04:25:21,600 --> 04:25:36,129
What was the point of coming in here?

2094
04:25:40,239 --> 04:26:01,229
Booth cam top right.

2095
04:26:06,690 --> 04:26:09,500
Um, what am I missing here?

2096
04:26:10,219 --> 04:26:15,729
Find the emergency radio code.

2097
04:26:16,290 --> 04:26:19,680
He should be on the front deck.

2098
04:26:20,399 --> 04:26:29,149
Okay.

2099
04:26:29,149 --> 04:26:30,190
Get out of the fucking way.

2100
04:26:30,829 --> 04:26:39,889
It's burning.

2101
04:26:41,520 --> 04:26:43,040
How do I get to the front of the deck?

2102
04:27:10,690 --> 04:27:11,010
What?

2103
04:27:11,010 --> 04:27:11,409
Where?

2104
04:27:11,409 --> 04:27:19,629
How do I get to the front deck?

2105
04:27:19,629 --> 04:27:21,389
Can I go in a door that I didn't see before?

2106
04:27:34,510 --> 04:27:35,549
It's too quiet now.

2107
04:27:37,940 --> 04:27:38,899
Guys, help me out here.

2108
04:27:38,899 --> 04:27:41,459
I don't understand what this game wants me to do.

2109
04:27:42,180 --> 04:27:42,979
It's right here.

2110
04:27:43,940 --> 04:27:44,500
That door.

2111
04:27:45,809 --> 04:27:47,170
I can't go into this door.

2112
04:27:52,190 --> 04:27:52,829
Go left?

2113
04:27:52,829 --> 04:27:53,709
Off to the side?

2114
04:27:59,010 --> 04:28:00,049
What the fuck is this?

2115
04:28:04,739 --> 04:28:06,340
I did it on purpose, but I had to see.

2116
04:28:13,790 --> 04:28:14,590
I had to do it though.

2117
04:28:14,590 --> 04:28:18,639
You know I had to.

2118
04:28:18,639 --> 04:28:41,889
Now I know where to go.

2119
04:29:04,829 --> 04:29:05,389
Get up there.

2120
04:29:11,040 --> 04:29:18,620
Do I actually have to fall and shimmy?

2121
04:29:20,379 --> 04:29:22,139
I went in a fucking circle.

2122
04:29:22,139 --> 04:29:23,659
You guys told me to do a go here.

2123
04:29:24,700 --> 04:29:25,260
Never mind.

2124
04:29:25,260 --> 04:29:26,459
That's where you started.

2125
04:29:26,459 --> 04:29:27,500
What do you mean never mind?

2126
04:29:28,059 --> 04:29:29,340
What do you mean never mind?

2127
04:29:29,340 --> 04:29:30,540
Everybody told me to go over there.

2128
04:29:32,770 --> 04:29:33,729
Everyone said go.

2129
04:29:33,729 --> 04:29:34,209
Go.

2130
04:29:34,209 --> 04:29:37,649
Oh, yeah, you're not gonna do the troll face and tell me.

2131
04:29:37,649 --> 04:29:40,129
No, you all got that wrong.

2132
04:29:40,129 --> 04:29:40,690
And so did I.

2133
04:29:42,049 --> 04:29:43,889
You all got that completely wrong.

2134
04:29:43,889 --> 04:29:44,450
All of you did.

2135
04:29:50,940 --> 04:29:51,739
Other side?

2136
04:29:52,620 --> 04:30:06,129
You walk past the stairs.

2137
04:30:10,129 --> 04:30:12,610
Yeah, we haven't played this game.

2138
04:30:12,610 --> 04:30:14,370
You guys all told me to go this way.

2139
04:30:22,530 --> 04:30:27,090
Dude, if the front of this fucking boat is this hard to find.

2140
04:30:27,090 --> 04:30:28,930
I'm sorry, but this is stupid.

2141
04:30:29,889 --> 04:30:31,780
You did it again?

2142
04:30:31,780 --> 04:30:33,459
The other side of the...

2143
04:30:33,459 --> 04:30:34,899
Do you want me to link you a walkthrough?

2144
04:30:36,190 --> 04:30:37,389
The left staircase.

2145
04:30:38,270 --> 04:30:39,819
This staircase right here.

2146
04:30:40,459 --> 04:30:41,340
This one right here.

2147
04:30:43,200 --> 04:30:44,079
This one right here.

2148
04:30:46,450 --> 04:30:47,969
Okay, I've been up here before.

2149
04:30:48,930 --> 04:30:50,819
I was already up here.

2150
04:30:55,069 --> 04:30:57,069
It just takes you to the other side of the boat.

2151
04:30:58,430 --> 04:30:59,549
What are you talking about?

2152
04:31:05,360 --> 04:31:07,040
Just go to customer service.

2153
04:31:07,600 --> 04:31:08,319
There's a door.

2154
04:31:11,889 --> 04:31:12,770
Why are you yelling?

2155
04:31:12,770 --> 04:31:15,889
Because it's really loud in my ears and I have to talk really loud to hear myself.

2156
04:31:16,770 --> 04:31:17,409
That door?

2157
04:31:18,290 --> 04:31:21,809
Dude, this door is just a scary jump scare for five seconds.

2158
04:31:25,809 --> 04:31:35,620
Look, nobody knows where I'm supposed to go.

2159
04:31:36,260 --> 04:31:43,469
This is not the front deck.

2160
04:31:55,709 --> 04:32:02,000
Go to the...

2161
04:32:02,000 --> 04:32:04,000
Try the opposite side of the boat from where you started.

2162
04:32:04,000 --> 04:32:04,559
Maybe.

2163
04:32:04,559 --> 04:32:05,200
I don't know.

2164
04:32:05,200 --> 04:32:05,760
This is...

2165
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:07,280
I don't understand what it wants me to do.

2166
04:32:08,239 --> 04:32:12,049
I've been every single place.

2167
04:32:12,930 --> 04:32:14,340
Go to the poop deck.

2168
04:32:14,979 --> 04:32:16,420
That was actually kind of funny.

2169
04:32:17,139 --> 04:32:22,370
Go to the tip of the boat.

2170
04:32:23,090 --> 04:32:25,260
Believe it or not, you're not in the right area now.

2171
04:32:25,260 --> 04:32:26,700
Go find the area you're supposed to be in.

2172
04:32:27,420 --> 04:32:28,379
Over here?

2173
04:32:28,379 --> 04:32:29,500
Have I looked back here?

2174
04:32:30,379 --> 04:32:53,040
How do I reload?

2175
04:33:00,639 --> 04:33:03,360
I'm sorry, that was impossible.

2176
04:33:03,360 --> 04:33:07,439
I had to accidentally touch every piece of this boat.

2177
04:33:14,340 --> 04:33:15,779
The door is locked by an electrical system.

2178
04:33:17,919 --> 04:33:19,439
Damn thing's locked from the other side.

2179
04:33:20,240 --> 04:33:22,779
Maybe I can shoot this thing.

2180
04:33:23,419 --> 04:33:33,119
It's unlocked.

2181
04:33:33,119 --> 04:33:33,919
Get off!

2182
04:33:34,880 --> 04:33:37,119
Stop!

2183
04:33:37,119 --> 04:33:37,919
Stop it!

2184
04:33:37,919 --> 04:33:38,319
Stop!

2185
04:33:38,880 --> 04:33:39,360
Stop!

2186
04:33:39,919 --> 04:33:40,400
Stop!

2187
04:33:45,069 --> 04:33:46,110
Why are you touching it?

2188
04:34:03,650 --> 04:34:04,450
What are you doing?

2189
04:34:07,470 --> 04:34:07,790
Hey.

2190
04:34:26,020 --> 04:34:27,459
I haven't saved it yet.

2191
04:34:32,209 --> 04:34:32,529
Hey.

2192
04:34:34,080 --> 04:34:34,880
All right.

2193
04:34:34,880 --> 04:34:37,439
Now, I don't remember even where to go from there.

2194
04:34:38,979 --> 04:34:42,419
I can't believe you can get electrocuted by the thing.

2195
04:34:48,029 --> 04:34:48,270
Hey.

2196
04:34:57,220 --> 04:34:57,860
Yeah, yeah.

2197
04:34:57,860 --> 04:34:58,340
I know.

2198
04:34:58,340 --> 04:34:58,819
I know.

2199
04:34:58,819 --> 04:34:59,220
Steady.

2200
04:34:59,220 --> 04:34:59,779
Watch out.

2201
04:34:59,779 --> 04:35:00,580
You can use ammo.

2202
04:35:00,580 --> 04:35:01,299
Put it in your gun.

2203
04:35:01,299 --> 04:35:01,619
Yep.

2204
04:35:01,619 --> 04:35:02,659
Sounds great.

2205
04:35:02,659 --> 04:35:03,299
Excellent.

2206
04:35:03,299 --> 04:35:04,099
I can't wait.

2207
04:35:06,580 --> 04:35:07,700
I'm not going to shoot anything.

2208
04:35:08,419 --> 04:35:10,500
Why would there be this much ammo around here if there's no enemies?

2209
04:35:11,459 --> 04:35:12,340
It's over here.

2210
04:35:12,340 --> 04:35:13,380
Straight ahead.

2211
04:35:13,459 --> 04:35:20,659
The one tiny, teeny, tiny, itsy bitsy, not even the width of a human being.

2212
04:35:21,540 --> 04:35:22,580
This is what I needed to see.

2213
04:35:23,540 --> 04:35:24,259
Look.

2214
04:35:24,259 --> 04:35:25,939
It's not even the width of a human being.

2215
04:35:25,939 --> 04:35:26,900
And this is where I have to go down.

2216
04:35:36,130 --> 04:35:36,689
Who's this?

2217
04:35:37,250 --> 04:35:37,970
Who's this guy?

2218
04:35:43,869 --> 04:35:44,509
What happened?

2219
04:36:03,299 --> 04:36:05,060
Why did that happen?

2220
04:36:05,060 --> 04:36:11,840
He got killed by the waves last time because you took so long.

2221
04:36:16,430 --> 04:36:17,869
You got to be fucking kidding me.

2222
04:36:32,020 --> 04:36:35,459
How do I, how do I do this correctly?

2223
04:36:57,340 --> 04:36:58,459
What are you doing?

2224
04:36:59,180 --> 04:37:13,900
Shut up.

2225
04:37:14,720 --> 04:37:15,200
Shut up.

2226
04:37:15,200 --> 04:37:15,599
Shut it up.

2227
04:37:28,180 --> 04:37:28,580
Save.

2228
04:37:28,580 --> 04:37:29,220
How do you save?

2229
04:37:44,240 --> 04:37:46,000
Now what?

2230
04:37:46,000 --> 04:37:46,479
Okay.

2231
04:37:46,479 --> 04:37:47,520
He should be in the front.

2232
04:37:47,520 --> 04:37:48,639
I got to get to the front deck.

2233
04:37:49,279 --> 04:38:10,959
The tank control games are stupid.

2234
04:38:10,959 --> 04:38:12,180
They're dumb.

2235
04:38:12,180 --> 04:38:14,139
They're dumb.

2236
04:38:14,139 --> 04:38:18,880
I have to say it to you.

2237
04:38:18,880 --> 04:38:28,610
That was, that took me way too long to, oh, okay, good.

2238
04:38:28,610 --> 04:38:48,830
You're a weenie.

2239
04:38:52,770 --> 04:38:53,490
I'm okay with that.

2240
04:39:13,490 --> 04:39:16,689
Yay.

2241
04:39:16,689 --> 04:39:19,569
Hey, hey.

2242
04:39:19,569 --> 04:39:24,990
Ah, what are you doing?

2243
04:39:24,990 --> 04:39:26,110
How am I supposed to see?

2244
04:40:00,189 --> 04:40:01,389
Where's the door?

2245
04:40:01,389 --> 04:40:07,419
It's a scary game now.

2246
04:40:07,419 --> 04:40:09,520
You're being too quiet.

2247
04:40:09,520 --> 04:40:13,939
I'm trying to focus.

2248
04:40:13,939 --> 04:40:19,020
Main deck.

2249
04:40:19,020 --> 04:40:20,220
This door ain't opening.

2250
04:40:53,419 --> 04:40:54,220
Save.

2251
04:40:54,220 --> 04:41:02,139
A note about the armory.

2252
04:41:02,139 --> 04:41:03,419
Smoking is forbidden.

2253
04:41:03,419 --> 04:41:05,419
Okay, so this is where, this is death.

2254
04:41:05,419 --> 04:41:24,740
That was Resident Evil typewriter music, right?

2255
04:41:24,740 --> 04:41:26,500
We need some comedic relief.

2256
04:41:26,500 --> 04:41:28,529
Can you put in a bit more effort, please?

2257
04:41:29,090 --> 04:41:43,360
Electrical boxes.

2258
04:41:43,360 --> 04:41:44,479
Yeah, I know.

2259
04:41:44,479 --> 04:41:44,959
Trust me.

2260
04:41:44,959 --> 04:42:06,060
I, I wish I had that info like 20 minutes ago when I got electrocuted to death.

2261
04:42:06,060 --> 04:42:06,860
It's locked.

2262
04:42:06,860 --> 04:42:16,740
Watch how much I'm using.

2263
04:42:16,740 --> 04:42:18,340
I ain't got an unlimited supply.

2264
04:42:18,340 --> 04:42:19,619
Why would I even take that?

2265
04:42:19,619 --> 04:42:22,900
I thought it was a health pack I could store in my inventory.

2266
04:42:22,900 --> 04:42:25,340
That's not what that was.

2267
04:42:25,340 --> 04:42:27,419
I had full health.

2268
04:42:27,419 --> 04:42:30,340
Have you been, I'm not going to read that.

2269
04:42:30,340 --> 04:42:54,750
A page from the, wait, I ain't reading all that.

2270
04:42:54,750 --> 04:42:55,709
Nevermind.

2271
04:42:55,709 --> 04:43:01,540
I wish I could just turn on, I wish it was a thing like a caveman filter

2272
04:43:01,540 --> 04:43:06,380
where it would just be like, this is like two or three pages of info.

2273
04:43:06,939 --> 04:43:11,500
And I can press like, I can hold start, select and press both the trigger buttons.

2274
04:43:11,500 --> 04:43:14,259
And it'll just give me one sentence.

2275
04:43:14,259 --> 04:43:16,619
Like, electrical box.

2276
04:43:16,619 --> 04:43:18,060
Danger.

2277
04:43:18,060 --> 04:43:18,380
Touch.

2278
04:43:18,380 --> 04:43:19,889
Do not.

2279
04:43:19,889 --> 04:43:20,130
Key.

2280
04:43:20,770 --> 04:43:22,909
Upper hallway.

2281
04:43:22,909 --> 04:43:24,509
Like, hallway 1B.

2282
04:43:25,150 --> 04:43:25,470
All right.

2283
04:43:25,470 --> 04:43:35,099
I just wish it would be, I would, I would pay extra for that.

2284
04:43:35,099 --> 04:43:37,630
Me die from electrical box.

2285
04:43:37,630 --> 04:43:38,990
Me leave key.

2286
04:43:38,990 --> 04:43:40,270
Hallway 1.

2287
04:43:40,270 --> 04:43:41,229
Door 1B.

2288
04:43:42,349 --> 04:43:43,310
Thank you.

2289
04:43:43,310 --> 04:43:44,110
Thank you so much.

2290
04:43:44,110 --> 04:43:44,909
What kind of way of ship is this?

2291
04:43:44,909 --> 04:43:54,369
I'm going to need an electronic key to open this sucker up.

2292
04:43:54,369 --> 04:44:03,279
Shit.

2293
04:44:03,279 --> 04:44:04,880
You need a journalist mode?

2294
04:44:04,880 --> 04:44:06,240
That's not Eve.

2295
04:44:06,240 --> 04:44:06,880
Come on.

2296
04:44:07,680 --> 04:44:16,369
No, I just want like a condensed mode.

2297
04:44:16,369 --> 04:44:40,700
Okay.

2298
04:44:40,700 --> 04:44:42,860
Well, good thing I already killed the zombie.

2299
04:44:50,959 --> 04:44:52,319
I knew it was going to happen.

2300
04:44:57,500 --> 04:44:57,979
Thank God.

2301
04:44:57,979 --> 04:44:58,619
I got the key.

2302
04:45:01,009 --> 04:45:02,290
Can I do something about this?

2303
04:45:02,930 --> 04:45:04,689
What do I do about this?

2304
04:45:04,689 --> 04:45:12,849
Okay.

2305
04:45:12,849 --> 04:45:13,250
Okay.

2306
04:45:13,250 --> 04:45:13,889
All right.

2307
04:45:13,889 --> 04:45:14,369
All right.

2308
04:45:14,369 --> 04:45:15,090
All right.

2309
04:45:15,090 --> 04:45:20,659
I need a handle for this door.

2310
04:45:20,659 --> 04:45:21,860
I have the upper deck key.

2311
04:45:22,419 --> 04:45:25,970
Let me just see if these doors, if any of these doors work after the next electrocution.

2312
04:45:26,130 --> 04:45:36,990
The damn thing's stuck.

2313
04:45:36,990 --> 04:45:41,330
There's too much water pressure.

2314
04:45:41,330 --> 04:45:41,889
I can't.

2315
04:45:43,889 --> 04:45:44,369
Upper deck.

2316
04:45:45,009 --> 04:46:07,759
It's unlocked.

2317
04:46:07,759 --> 04:46:11,040
I need a save point right now.

2318
04:46:11,040 --> 04:46:15,939
I need a save point right now.

2319
04:46:15,939 --> 04:46:17,299
This is really bad.

2320
04:46:17,299 --> 04:46:51,380
Nothing even in here.

2321
04:46:51,380 --> 04:46:55,009
Really?

2322
04:46:55,009 --> 04:47:14,430
This is a stupid idea.

2323
04:47:14,430 --> 04:47:15,150
Shut up.

2324
04:47:15,150 --> 04:47:16,290
Shut up, idiot.

2325
04:47:47,220 --> 04:47:48,180
All right.

2326
04:47:48,180 --> 04:47:52,770
Please raise your hand if in five minutes you could get back to the front of the boat

2327
04:47:52,770 --> 04:47:53,650
where we were.

2328
04:47:53,650 --> 04:47:56,319
Good luck.

2329
04:47:56,319 --> 04:47:58,770
Because I have no, I have no idea.

2330
04:47:58,849 --> 04:48:17,869
Why did he do that?

2331
04:48:20,830 --> 04:48:24,130
Dude, just if you just waited five seconds.

2332
04:48:28,450 --> 04:48:29,330
Okay.

2333
04:48:29,330 --> 04:48:32,419
Should I check this door?

2334
04:48:32,419 --> 04:48:35,040
What was the point of that?

2335
04:48:35,040 --> 04:48:39,580
Front deck.

2336
04:48:39,580 --> 04:48:41,599
I think I made it to the front deck.

2337
04:49:06,979 --> 04:49:08,099
All burned.

2338
04:49:08,099 --> 04:49:32,349
Must be downstairs.

2339
04:49:32,349 --> 04:50:03,709
Where?

2340
04:50:03,709 --> 04:50:04,590
Page from the diary.

2341
04:50:05,229 --> 04:50:15,869
Boy, it doesn't hurt.

2342
04:50:15,869 --> 04:50:16,430
Infection.

2343
04:50:18,259 --> 04:50:19,540
Antidote needed.

2344
04:50:19,540 --> 04:50:23,150
Appreciate it.

2345
04:50:23,150 --> 04:50:43,069
The gun sounds, sounds like they're coming from a different room in the house.

2346
04:50:45,630 --> 04:50:46,450
It sounds like they're...

2347
04:50:54,619 --> 04:51:05,009
The thing's stuck.

2348
04:51:05,009 --> 04:51:08,509
Lansing?

2349
04:51:08,509 --> 04:51:11,939
Man.

2350
04:51:11,939 --> 04:51:12,659
I'll give it to him though.

2351
04:51:12,659 --> 04:51:13,619
This is pretty good.

2352
04:51:13,619 --> 04:51:21,860
This isn't, this ain't bad.

2353
04:51:21,860 --> 04:51:27,409
At least I found the code.

2354
04:51:27,409 --> 04:51:29,409
This isn't...

2355
04:51:33,520 --> 04:51:34,639
Find the radio room.

2356
04:51:34,639 --> 04:51:35,119
Good luck.

2357
04:51:35,119 --> 04:51:37,490
I have no idea.

2358
04:51:37,490 --> 04:51:40,049
Actually, I'm probably going to actually ask somebody to look that up.

2359
04:51:40,049 --> 04:51:42,610
And because this is, how am I ever going to find that from here?

2360
04:52:42,959 --> 04:52:53,540
Yeah, I'd like to save.

2361
04:52:53,540 --> 04:52:54,580
Weird pop-up.

2362
04:52:54,580 --> 04:53:03,360
But who am I, who's playing as who?

2363
04:53:03,360 --> 04:53:04,319
Oh, it's me.

2364
04:53:04,319 --> 04:53:04,819
Wait.

2365
04:53:24,900 --> 04:53:26,419
Oh, get out.

2366
04:53:33,520 --> 04:53:34,560
Where's the radio room?

2367
04:53:35,729 --> 04:53:39,810
Wait, the radio room is the first room at the very, the beginning of the entire thing, isn't it?

2368
04:53:40,529 --> 04:53:42,290
That's the radio room, isn't it?

2369
04:53:43,009 --> 04:53:46,049
That would be correct.

2370
04:53:47,330 --> 04:53:59,509
Yeah, I would imagine, right?

2371
04:53:59,509 --> 04:53:59,990
It has to be.

2372
04:54:00,709 --> 04:54:25,639
This game's...

2373
04:54:26,659 --> 04:54:27,700
I don't, I don't hate it.

2374
04:54:28,419 --> 04:54:31,830
It's fun.

2375
04:54:33,720 --> 04:54:34,759
It's fun enough.

2376
04:54:34,759 --> 04:54:45,139
I just wanted to see if those things actually explode.

2377
04:54:45,139 --> 04:55:01,909
Okay, this is where we have fun trying to go all the way back to the very beginning of the game.

2378
04:55:01,909 --> 04:55:07,349
To make the ship roll realistically, the developers had to write a completely new program

2379
04:55:07,349 --> 04:55:12,229
dubbed the Darkwave Editor to allow them to control movement on both vertical and horizontal axes.

2380
04:55:12,950 --> 04:55:16,950
They also used real physics to simulate the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship.

2381
04:55:16,950 --> 04:55:21,029
Through the random nature created by this, the player character required nine times

2382
04:55:21,029 --> 04:55:23,830
the amount of animations usually seen in third-person games.

2383
04:55:24,389 --> 04:55:27,750
Ultimately, the game contained more than nine hundred...

2384
04:55:29,029 --> 04:55:29,990
What else?

2385
04:55:30,229 --> 04:55:30,630
It's cool.

2386
04:55:33,110 --> 04:55:33,909
This is a good game.

2387
04:55:34,549 --> 04:55:35,830
Look, this came out...

2388
04:55:35,830 --> 04:55:38,759
I don't even know when, but like, this is cool.

2389
04:55:40,279 --> 04:55:41,560
Look at the swaying back and forth.

2390
04:55:45,889 --> 04:55:46,610
That's really cool.

2391
04:55:53,459 --> 04:56:01,799
Hey, we've played at least one other game in this genre of survival horror like this.

2392
04:56:01,799 --> 04:56:03,799
This is the only one that I wouldn't eat.

2393
04:56:03,799 --> 04:56:20,799
What's that supposed to mean?

2394
04:56:20,799 --> 04:56:21,680
I don't know.

2395
04:56:21,680 --> 04:56:27,330
It's the only one I would keep around.

2396
04:56:27,330 --> 04:56:31,009
I would eat the other ones, but no, I wouldn't eat the other ones.

2397
04:56:31,090 --> 04:56:36,799
It's just the only one that I wouldn't break.

2398
04:56:38,799 --> 04:56:39,200
I don't know.

2399
04:56:39,840 --> 04:56:40,959
I thought eat was a different...

2400
04:56:40,959 --> 04:56:45,040
was like a cooler way to say like throw away or like break.

2401
04:56:45,759 --> 04:56:58,119
No, we got to know who that is.

2402
04:56:58,759 --> 04:57:11,349
Damn.

2403
04:57:11,349 --> 04:57:15,060
What's this?

2404
04:57:15,060 --> 04:57:16,419
It looks like this will do the job.

2405
04:57:17,060 --> 04:57:25,830
Handwheel for the fish hold door.

2406
04:57:25,830 --> 04:57:26,869
Ooh, that was a health pack.

2407
04:57:27,430 --> 04:57:35,279
Dude, you're not beating the you're not human allegations.

2408
04:57:44,500 --> 04:57:45,880
Is he dead?

2409
04:57:49,330 --> 04:57:50,290
What the fuck?

2410
04:57:54,049 --> 04:58:09,880
I have to shoot their heads.

2411
04:58:10,599 --> 04:58:16,240
See, I told you I'm gonna ammo.

2412
04:58:16,240 --> 04:58:23,119
Thank God.

2413
04:58:29,459 --> 04:58:32,680
It's actually scary.

2414
04:58:32,680 --> 04:58:36,130
Where do I go from here?

2415
04:58:36,130 --> 04:58:38,610
I got, I got, we can turn around.

2416
04:58:38,610 --> 04:58:47,590
I can't.

2417
04:58:47,590 --> 04:58:47,909
All right.

2418
04:58:47,909 --> 04:58:48,950
Well, sorry.

2419
04:58:48,950 --> 04:58:53,909
How do I get out of here?

2420
04:59:17,380 --> 04:59:18,659
Holy shit.

2421
04:59:18,659 --> 04:59:23,759
You got to find the fish stick door.

2422
04:59:23,759 --> 04:59:28,799
You're so greasy.

2423
04:59:28,799 --> 04:59:30,479
Sound is so decent.

2424
04:59:30,479 --> 04:59:31,200
Is it?

2425
04:59:31,200 --> 04:59:38,040
Is it what did nobody tell me for like the last five hours?

2426
04:59:38,439 --> 04:59:42,240
No, it's not.

2427
04:59:42,240 --> 04:59:42,959
Not at all.

2428
04:59:42,959 --> 04:59:45,799
It's fine.

2429
04:59:45,799 --> 04:59:46,200
It's fine.

2430
04:59:46,200 --> 04:59:46,840
No, it's fine.

2431
04:59:46,840 --> 04:59:48,200
It's fine.

2432
04:59:48,200 --> 04:59:50,400
Sounds fine.

2433
04:59:50,400 --> 04:59:51,439
It's a stream.

2434
04:59:51,439 --> 04:59:57,090
Oh, I mean, yeah, I'm going to get like a little moisture all over my face.

2435
04:59:57,090 --> 04:59:58,049
I'm sitting here.

2436
04:59:58,049 --> 05:00:00,369
I've got an Xbox sauna in the room.

2437
05:00:00,369 --> 05:00:07,970
I've got a GTX 3090 going at firing at all cylinders.

2438
05:00:07,970 --> 05:00:11,889
I've got three monitors blaring light into my face.

2439
05:00:11,889 --> 05:00:15,889
I have a ring light up here blaring sauna like heat into my face.

2440
05:00:16,450 --> 05:00:20,450
You have a 3090?

2441
05:00:20,450 --> 05:00:20,930
Yes, I do.

2442
05:00:21,490 --> 05:00:28,770
All right.

2443
05:00:28,770 --> 05:00:29,729
How do I get out of here?

2444
05:00:37,060 --> 05:00:37,939
Oh, I remember this.

2445
05:00:39,799 --> 05:00:40,439
This part.

2446
05:00:40,439 --> 05:00:41,400
And then I'm close.

2447
05:00:43,810 --> 05:00:44,689
I'm really close.

2448
05:00:51,840 --> 05:00:53,439
Privileged streamer.

2449
05:00:53,439 --> 05:00:55,040
Oh, do not be mistaken.

2450
05:00:55,040 --> 05:00:56,080
I am a moron.

2451
05:00:56,720 --> 05:00:57,360
It sucked.

2452
05:00:57,919 --> 05:00:59,360
I didn't want this.

2453
05:00:59,360 --> 05:01:00,959
I did not want this card.

2454
05:01:02,720 --> 05:01:08,959
I paid so such a stupid price for this because there were no graphics cards.

2455
05:01:08,959 --> 05:01:09,759
There were none.

2456
05:01:10,919 --> 05:01:13,880
Do you remember a few years ago, two or two years ago?

2457
05:01:14,599 --> 05:01:19,720
They were bots just waiting and anytime like a 3080 or like a 3070 came up,

2458
05:01:20,520 --> 05:01:23,159
there was whole websites, there were whole discords and bots

2459
05:01:23,159 --> 05:01:25,400
dedicated to scooping them up at the second they were available.

2460
05:01:26,279 --> 05:01:32,119
I found one 3090 for a stupid price and I was like, I hate myself for doing this.

2461
05:01:32,119 --> 05:01:35,080
But I waited like probably four or five, six months.

2462
05:01:35,080 --> 05:01:36,680
I was like, what the fuck, man?

2463
05:01:38,279 --> 05:01:40,599
I want a new computer and I want a new graphics card.

2464
05:01:41,319 --> 05:01:42,799
I really didn't want to do it.

2465
05:01:46,959 --> 05:01:48,400
This door ain't opening.

2466
05:01:48,400 --> 05:01:49,520
You look like a wax model.

2467
05:01:50,240 --> 05:01:57,700
I wanted a 3090.

2468
05:01:57,700 --> 05:02:00,419
No, a 3080, but it just was never going to happen.

2469
05:02:01,220 --> 05:02:03,939
And I didn't want a 3070 because I got streaming.

2470
05:02:03,939 --> 05:02:06,340
It was like, I want to stream and be able to play games of good quality

2471
05:02:06,340 --> 05:02:07,139
and stream it and stuff.

2472
05:02:07,139 --> 05:02:07,860
So I was like, whatever.

2473
05:02:11,189 --> 05:02:11,430
Okay.

2474
05:02:11,430 --> 05:02:12,470
Where do I need to go from here?

2475
05:02:14,319 --> 05:02:15,520
It's back this way, isn't it?

2476
05:02:16,500 --> 05:02:16,740
Yeah.

2477
05:02:18,319 --> 05:02:19,680
And then where?

2478
05:02:19,680 --> 05:02:19,919
Here?

2479
05:02:25,919 --> 05:02:26,959
Where's the way out of here?

2480
05:02:30,790 --> 05:02:31,430
Is it this one?

2481
05:02:32,150 --> 05:02:36,279
No.

2482
05:02:36,279 --> 05:02:36,520
Okay.

2483
05:02:36,520 --> 05:02:37,639
This is the armory.

2484
05:02:38,279 --> 05:02:44,119
What was the price?

2485
05:02:44,919 --> 05:02:47,240
I don't remember, but it was, it had,

2486
05:02:47,240 --> 05:02:49,799
it was definitely more than a couple thousand dollars.

2487
05:02:51,840 --> 05:02:54,560
It was, it was, it was, it was, it was just like,

2488
05:02:54,560 --> 05:02:56,880
this is just her stomach ache thinking about it.

2489
05:02:58,470 --> 05:02:59,270
It was a stomach ache.

2490
05:02:59,270 --> 05:03:01,189
I got a stomach ache looking at it.

2491
05:03:05,139 --> 05:03:06,180
It was so bad.

2492
05:03:07,220 --> 05:03:14,979
I ended up getting a 3060 TI for two and a half times retail.

2493
05:03:15,779 --> 05:03:22,720
Can somebody help me here?

2494
05:03:23,279 --> 05:03:26,599
What brand of 3090?

2495
05:03:26,599 --> 05:03:32,389
I actually EVGA, maybe.

2496
05:03:33,110 --> 05:03:36,740
Then can somebody help me go down the stairs?

2497
05:03:36,740 --> 05:03:37,060
Thank you.

2498
05:03:37,779 --> 05:03:54,400
This is with the electricities down here.

2499
05:03:54,959 --> 05:03:57,919
It's unlocked.

2500
05:03:57,919 --> 05:03:58,959
Oh, shit.

2501
05:03:58,959 --> 05:03:59,599
Okay.

2502
05:03:59,599 --> 05:04:08,560
They stopped making Nvidia cards.

2503
05:04:08,560 --> 05:04:08,799
Yeah.

2504
05:04:08,799 --> 05:04:15,939
I mean, I, who even makes good graphics cards now?

2505
05:04:15,939 --> 05:04:18,099
You don't play games that require 3090.

2506
05:04:18,659 --> 05:04:21,220
Have a streaming requires a very powerful machine,

2507
05:04:21,220 --> 05:04:22,740
especially if you're going to do the GPU rendering.

2508
05:04:36,799 --> 05:04:37,599
Swag.

2509
05:04:48,360 --> 05:05:00,549
Ooh, boy.

2510
05:05:01,110 --> 05:05:02,389
Son of a bitch.

2511
05:05:02,389 --> 05:05:15,569
He's still alive.

2512
05:05:15,569 --> 05:05:47,270
That it?

2513
05:05:47,830 --> 05:06:06,229
But yeah, I don't, I typically do graphics cards every,

2514
05:06:07,680 --> 05:06:14,720
I want to say I usually wait at least two or three generations.

2515
05:06:14,720 --> 05:06:16,770
So if I have a 3090,

2516
05:06:16,770 --> 05:06:19,650
I'm probably going to wait for at least like the 6000,

2517
05:06:19,650 --> 05:06:24,049
like the 6090 or whatever, a 6080.

2518
05:06:24,049 --> 05:06:27,349
I usually wait two or three generations.

2519
05:06:27,349 --> 05:06:32,479
Before the 3090, I had a 1080.

2520
05:06:32,479 --> 05:06:33,200
So what's that?

2521
05:06:33,200 --> 05:06:36,290
Two, two generations, three, maybe.

2522
05:06:36,290 --> 05:06:39,119
Took a while for the 30 series to come out, didn't it?

2523
05:06:39,119 --> 05:06:42,240
The damn thing stuck.

2524
05:06:42,240 --> 05:06:43,439
What am I missing in here?

2525
05:06:43,520 --> 05:06:44,979
It's a latch.

2526
05:06:44,979 --> 05:06:49,799
And let me be really honest.

2527
05:06:49,799 --> 05:06:53,560
That 1080 lasted an incredibly long time.

2528
05:06:53,560 --> 05:06:57,189
And do I have permission to swag out?

2529
05:06:57,189 --> 05:07:06,150
Yeah, you don't have to wait.

2530
05:07:06,150 --> 05:07:10,869
I don't, I don't want to just buy shit just to buy it.

2531
05:07:10,869 --> 05:07:14,159
I'd rather just get what I pay for and use it

2532
05:07:14,159 --> 05:07:15,680
and get the best out of it whenever I can.

2533
05:07:17,459 --> 05:07:19,299
I don't buy a new phone every year.

2534
05:07:21,250 --> 05:07:26,720
That's kind of, I feel like that's an overkill.

2535
05:07:26,720 --> 05:07:29,279
I buy a new graphics card when I buy a new phone.

2536
05:07:29,279 --> 05:07:32,400
The damn thing stuck.

2537
05:07:32,400 --> 05:07:34,639
They happen at the same time.

2538
05:07:34,959 --> 05:07:46,119
So what am I, what?

2539
05:07:46,119 --> 05:07:47,560
Is it an item I didn't get?

2540
05:07:47,560 --> 05:07:51,919
Who buys a phone every year?

2541
05:07:51,919 --> 05:07:57,349
Didn't I get a fish key?

2542
05:07:58,150 --> 05:07:59,669
How come I can't use it here?

2543
05:07:59,669 --> 05:08:09,439
You got the radio room key.

2544
05:08:09,439 --> 05:08:10,560
I got a fish thing though.

2545
05:08:10,560 --> 05:08:14,720
It said like the fish thing.

2546
05:08:14,720 --> 05:08:15,520
Didn't it say that?

2547
05:08:26,400 --> 05:08:26,799
No.

2548
05:08:26,799 --> 05:08:27,919
So what's the point of coming down here?

2549
05:08:27,919 --> 05:08:29,599
Just to get scared and then leave?

2550
05:08:29,599 --> 05:08:34,529
Yeah, I don't need new phones.

2551
05:08:34,529 --> 05:08:35,889
I like the stuff that I have.

2552
05:08:35,889 --> 05:08:38,080
And I get, and then I, I don't know.

2553
05:08:38,080 --> 05:08:39,759
Cause then here's another thing, right?

2554
05:08:39,759 --> 05:08:41,840
You buy a phone every single year.

2555
05:08:41,840 --> 05:08:44,819
You're just going to have like a bunch of fucking phones.

2556
05:08:44,819 --> 05:08:45,619
And then what?

2557
05:08:45,700 --> 05:08:48,340
I mean, you can try to use one of those recycling programs.

2558
05:08:49,680 --> 05:08:50,159
I don't know.

2559
05:08:50,159 --> 05:08:52,639
I just, I don't want, I don't just don't want it.

2560
05:08:54,340 --> 05:08:55,540
I mean, you could just turn them in.

2561
05:08:56,180 --> 05:08:59,060
But I don't want a new, because when you get a new phone,

2562
05:09:00,529 --> 05:09:02,369
think about what happens when you get a new phone.

2563
05:09:05,889 --> 05:09:07,490
When you get a new phone, it's like you have to re,

2564
05:09:07,490 --> 05:09:08,849
your whole life has to reset.

2565
05:09:10,240 --> 05:09:12,639
Like you got to get all the applications

2566
05:09:12,639 --> 05:09:14,560
and you got to get all your contacts.

2567
05:09:14,560 --> 05:09:16,000
You got to, hey, you got to do this.

2568
05:09:16,000 --> 05:09:16,479
You got to do that.

2569
05:09:16,479 --> 05:09:17,919
You got to update this.

2570
05:09:17,919 --> 05:09:18,880
No, I don't want it.

2571
05:09:18,880 --> 05:09:19,599
I don't know.

2572
05:09:19,599 --> 05:09:21,439
I have, but I have works and it's fine.

2573
05:09:21,439 --> 05:09:22,080
It's up to date.

2574
05:09:22,799 --> 05:09:27,119
All right.

2575
05:09:27,119 --> 05:09:27,840
Where do I go from here?

2576
05:09:28,400 --> 05:09:44,959
Can you help just transfer your shit?

2577
05:09:44,959 --> 05:09:47,040
But I don't want a new phone every year.

2578
05:09:47,040 --> 05:09:48,560
They don't change very much.

2579
05:09:49,889 --> 05:09:51,250
I don't need new shit.

2580
05:09:51,889 --> 05:09:52,529
I, okay.

2581
05:09:52,529 --> 05:09:54,849
If you have like an iPhone, if you have an iPhone,

2582
05:09:55,729 --> 05:09:57,970
let's just say like an iPhone 12 right now,

2583
05:09:58,610 --> 05:10:00,849
right now, like you have an iPhone 12 or an iPhone, like 13.

2584
05:10:01,409 --> 05:10:05,759
What is going to happen next year where you,

2585
05:10:05,759 --> 05:10:07,439
you need to upgrade it?

2586
05:10:08,080 --> 05:10:10,599
What's a, when you go on Twitter,

2587
05:10:11,159 --> 05:10:12,439
when you're on Snapchat,

2588
05:10:12,439 --> 05:10:14,680
like the filter loads 0.2 seconds faster.

2589
05:10:14,680 --> 05:10:15,000
What is it?

2590
05:10:15,000 --> 05:10:15,799
What's the need for it?

2591
05:10:16,819 --> 05:10:17,540
USB-C.

2592
05:10:20,319 --> 05:10:22,319
I'm telling you, two or three years,

2593
05:10:22,319 --> 05:10:25,520
you'll get some new, there'll be some new development

2594
05:10:25,520 --> 05:10:26,560
to make it worthwhile.

2595
05:10:27,540 --> 05:10:29,939
You're just getting, it's like buying Madden every year.

2596
05:10:31,509 --> 05:10:35,430
It's like Madden 2021, 22, 23, 24.

2597
05:10:35,430 --> 05:10:37,509
You know, I just buy Madden 20 fucking 20

2598
05:10:37,509 --> 05:10:38,709
and I just update the rosters.

2599
05:10:42,290 --> 05:10:44,369
I don't, I don't need a new Madden.

2600
05:10:46,639 --> 05:10:48,080
Or I go into the character creator

2601
05:10:48,080 --> 05:10:49,919
and I just make the motherfuckers myself.

2602
05:10:51,139 --> 05:10:55,939
You know how long I played MVP baseball like 2004, 2005?

2603
05:10:56,580 --> 05:10:59,299
And I just made every single fucking major league

2604
05:10:59,299 --> 05:11:00,580
baseball player, I didn't care.

2605
05:11:00,580 --> 05:11:01,459
You can just replace them.

2606
05:11:02,099 --> 05:11:05,680
It takes a little bit of work, but it's worth it.

2607
05:11:05,680 --> 05:11:08,959
It's an iPhone rant.

2608
05:11:09,520 --> 05:11:11,520
No, no, I like phones.

2609
05:11:12,319 --> 05:11:14,880
Oh, wow, the Galaxy, like super cool, cool.

2610
05:11:14,880 --> 05:11:15,919
That's fucking cool.

2611
05:11:15,919 --> 05:11:19,700
But you don't need one every single year.

2612
05:11:19,779 --> 05:11:24,659
You know, you get a Galaxy, a Galaxy phone, sick.

2613
05:11:24,659 --> 05:11:27,299
That's fucking awesome.

2614
05:11:27,299 --> 05:11:30,180
You're going to get the Galaxy phone seven months later.

2615
05:11:30,180 --> 05:11:32,310
You already have the Galaxy 2.

2616
05:11:32,310 --> 05:11:33,189
You need the Galaxy 3.

2617
05:11:33,189 --> 05:11:34,950
You're already on a different goddamn,

2618
05:11:34,950 --> 05:11:36,790
you're in a goddamn nebula at that point.

2619
05:11:36,790 --> 05:11:38,229
You need another Galaxy.

2620
05:11:38,790 --> 05:11:39,909
It's the, you already have the 2.

2621
05:11:39,909 --> 05:11:40,869
You don't need the 3.

2622
05:11:40,869 --> 05:11:42,959
What does the 3 give you, the 2 that you're still,

2623
05:11:42,959 --> 05:11:44,159
you're in outer space already.

2624
05:11:44,159 --> 05:11:49,319
Somebody tell me where to go.

2625
05:11:54,560 --> 05:11:56,529
Somebody tell me what, like door to open?

2626
05:12:00,930 --> 05:12:03,090
Go down the hall, electrocution door is on the right.

2627
05:12:08,000 --> 05:12:08,720
I can hear it.

2628
05:12:09,200 --> 05:12:17,279
Where is it?

2629
05:12:17,840 --> 05:12:25,860
Am I going the right way?

2630
05:12:27,430 --> 05:12:29,029
Yeah, the right is the crew quarters.

2631
05:12:29,029 --> 05:12:29,830
Just use a guide.

2632
05:12:31,029 --> 05:12:34,630
This is the right way.

2633
05:12:34,630 --> 05:12:35,509
It's right through here, right?

2634
05:12:37,270 --> 05:12:37,909
It's right through here.

2635
05:12:45,040 --> 05:12:46,319
Yeah, no, it's not right.

2636
05:12:48,740 --> 05:12:49,860
I hate backtracking.

2637
05:12:49,860 --> 05:12:51,939
I just want, just go forward.

2638
05:12:51,939 --> 05:12:53,139
Or I need a map.

2639
05:12:53,139 --> 05:12:54,419
If there's backtracking, I need a map.

2640
05:12:56,819 --> 05:12:57,700
You're cheating already.

2641
05:13:03,990 --> 05:13:05,830
I feel like I'm so close, but so far away.

2642
05:13:10,180 --> 05:13:11,700
They just spawn randomly.

2643
05:13:11,700 --> 05:13:13,299
It's randomly generated spawns.

2644
05:13:13,939 --> 05:13:16,840
I just did not expect anybody to be right here.

2645
05:13:22,419 --> 05:13:23,220
Next game.

2646
05:13:23,220 --> 05:13:23,619
All right.

2647
05:13:23,619 --> 05:13:26,419
But I need to at least complete this part.

2648
05:13:27,060 --> 05:13:28,819
Draw your own map.

2649
05:13:28,819 --> 05:13:29,220
I can't.

2650
05:13:29,860 --> 05:13:34,470
From where I'm standing right now, where do I go?

2651
05:13:34,470 --> 05:13:35,650
Just help me.

2652
05:13:36,610 --> 05:13:45,880
I know you guys can help me.

2653
05:13:45,880 --> 05:13:47,319
Do whatever you want.

2654
05:13:47,319 --> 05:13:47,560
Up.

2655
05:13:49,569 --> 05:13:51,250
That was like a Twitch staff member.

2656
05:13:51,250 --> 05:13:52,369
So I'm going to listen to that.

2657
05:13:53,009 --> 05:13:53,729
Back and up.

2658
05:13:54,450 --> 05:14:02,400
How do I go up?

2659
05:14:02,400 --> 05:14:11,459
Just be yourself, little guy.

2660
05:14:16,930 --> 05:14:19,279
How do I get out of here?

2661
05:14:19,279 --> 05:14:19,680
Just help.

2662
05:14:24,400 --> 05:14:25,200
I'm playing Obi-Wan.

2663
05:14:26,080 --> 05:14:26,720
I'm playing Obi-Wan.

2664
05:14:26,720 --> 05:14:27,520
This is why I need a map.

2665
05:14:27,520 --> 05:14:28,240
Just give me a map.

2666
05:14:28,880 --> 05:14:29,919
Just give me a map.

2667
05:14:29,919 --> 05:14:31,360
Backtracking sucks without a map.

2668
05:14:32,080 --> 05:14:40,000
Hog, I made it up.

2669
05:14:41,599 --> 05:14:43,200
Literally nobody's played this game.

2670
05:14:43,200 --> 05:14:44,319
We can't help you.

2671
05:14:47,000 --> 05:14:49,400
Fuck, I just want to complete this one mission.

2672
05:14:49,400 --> 05:14:52,599
So I can say I got through chapter one of Cold Fear, at least.

2673
05:14:53,400 --> 05:14:54,599
How do I get out of here?

2674
05:15:01,779 --> 05:15:05,299
No, it's one of these seven or eight doors.

2675
05:15:07,409 --> 05:15:13,720
I have to take the disc out.

2676
05:15:13,720 --> 05:15:14,840
It's not this door.

2677
05:15:15,560 --> 05:15:19,330
Please, did you try the far left door?

2678
05:15:19,970 --> 05:15:34,240
This one, it's right here.

2679
05:15:34,240 --> 05:15:35,599
It's right here.

2680
05:15:35,599 --> 05:15:37,279
I remember we walked over here and I was like, oh, cool.

2681
05:15:37,279 --> 05:15:38,799
What the fuck?

2682
05:15:38,799 --> 05:15:40,709
Other left.

2683
05:15:40,709 --> 05:15:41,590
It's right here.

2684
05:15:42,150 --> 05:15:42,950
Don't give up.

2685
05:15:42,950 --> 05:15:44,470
My cat would be disappointed in you.

2686
05:15:45,349 --> 05:15:45,750
Fuck.

2687
05:15:46,310 --> 05:15:47,799
It's not that one.

2688
05:15:47,799 --> 05:15:48,599
It's not that one.

2689
05:15:49,880 --> 05:15:50,680
It's not this one.

2690
05:15:50,680 --> 05:15:51,400
This one doesn't open.

2691
05:15:51,400 --> 05:15:52,200
It's not this one.

2692
05:15:54,049 --> 05:15:56,529
So what door is it to get out of here?

2693
05:15:57,169 --> 05:15:58,389
Stop yelling at people.

2694
05:16:06,400 --> 05:16:07,439
It's that one.

2695
05:16:08,159 --> 05:16:19,830
Okay, I didn't have any guns.

2696
05:16:20,389 --> 05:16:29,000
Okay, I'm almost there.

2697
05:16:29,560 --> 05:16:32,020
And then after I turn this in, I'm going to play Obi-Wan.

2698
05:16:32,020 --> 05:16:47,240
Can we have a break?

2699
05:16:47,799 --> 05:16:53,220
You'll have a break in the time it takes me to take Obi-Wan out of its case

2700
05:16:53,220 --> 05:16:54,500
and put it into the disk tray.

2701
05:16:54,500 --> 05:16:56,020
It's about five minutes.

2702
05:16:56,020 --> 05:16:58,720
Why am I going back down?

2703
05:16:58,720 --> 05:17:10,080
What's happening now?

2704
05:17:17,840 --> 05:17:23,360
Why would it take you five minutes?

2705
05:17:23,360 --> 05:17:23,840
Time it.

2706
05:17:24,400 --> 05:17:49,909
You don't have a fucking head.

2707
05:17:49,909 --> 05:17:50,790
You can't do that.

2708
05:17:51,349 --> 05:17:55,669
I've been really on edge tonight.

2709
05:17:55,669 --> 05:18:28,979
I can't wait till we get to here.

2710
05:18:31,459 --> 05:18:32,419
This looks like a radio.

2711
05:18:37,439 --> 05:18:40,000
Apollo 7, Niner.

2712
05:18:40,000 --> 05:18:40,560
Can you hear me?

2713
05:18:41,200 --> 05:18:42,400
Who am I speaking to?

2714
05:18:42,400 --> 05:18:44,709
This thing's dead.

2715
05:18:44,709 --> 05:18:45,669
This is Hanson.

2716
05:18:45,669 --> 05:18:46,549
Everyone else is down.

2717
05:18:47,750 --> 05:18:48,389
Bloody hell.

2718
05:18:49,029 --> 05:18:51,439
Then I guess we're stuck with each other, Hanson,

2719
05:18:51,439 --> 05:18:52,959
but you're not the only survivor.

2720
05:18:53,680 --> 05:18:56,159
There's still a very dangerous man loose on that ship.

2721
05:18:56,159 --> 05:18:57,439
Colonel Dmitry Yusupov.

2722
05:18:58,389 --> 05:18:59,990
He needs to answer a few questions.

2723
05:19:00,709 --> 05:19:02,630
Round him up, and then we'll get you out of there.

2724
05:19:03,430 --> 05:19:04,069
Who's we?

2725
05:19:04,950 --> 05:19:05,450
Babe.

2726
05:19:19,000 --> 05:19:19,500
Okay.

2727
05:19:21,080 --> 05:19:22,919
Find that person.

2728
05:19:25,139 --> 05:19:25,639
Got it.

2729
05:19:35,880 --> 05:19:42,439
Why did they just turn me?

2730
05:19:43,400 --> 05:19:45,459
Wait, where am I?

2731
05:19:50,240 --> 05:19:51,360
All right, that was fun.

2732
05:19:51,360 --> 05:19:52,720
That was cold fear.

2733
05:19:54,080 --> 05:19:58,900
It is apparently January 15th, 2001,

2734
05:19:58,900 --> 05:20:03,299
and it's somehow this clock is wrong,

2735
05:20:03,299 --> 05:20:05,139
but not by very much, which is weird.

2736
05:20:06,389 --> 05:20:07,750
It's 2001.

2737
05:20:11,759 --> 05:20:13,200
I'm not alive yet.

2738
05:20:16,130 --> 05:20:16,630
What?

2739
05:20:21,029 --> 05:20:23,029
Pog, I'm not even alive yet.

2740
05:20:29,189 --> 05:20:29,990
All right, that was fun.

2741
05:20:29,990 --> 05:20:30,790
It's time for Obi-Wan.

2742
05:20:31,750 --> 05:20:33,110
I would rate this one.

2743
05:20:33,110 --> 05:20:35,590
I'd give this like a B plus on the tier list.

2744
05:20:35,590 --> 05:20:36,150
It was like a B.

2745
05:20:36,709 --> 05:20:38,840
I think there was some fun.

2746
05:20:38,840 --> 05:20:39,319
That was great.

2747
05:20:40,479 --> 05:20:43,279
Okay, so how long does it take to put a disc in and to load it up?

2748
05:20:43,279 --> 05:20:43,599
Here we go.

2749
05:20:43,599 --> 05:20:44,900
You ready?

2750
05:20:44,900 --> 05:20:48,229
Start timing right now.

2751
05:20:48,229 --> 05:20:51,889
Opening tray.

2752
05:20:51,889 --> 05:20:56,919
Grabbing Obi-Wan.

2753
05:20:57,560 --> 05:20:58,759
Opening Obi-Wan.

2754
05:20:58,759 --> 05:21:02,180
Taking Obi-Wan out of that.

2755
05:21:02,180 --> 05:21:05,380
If that was bionicle, I am going to be furious with you.

2756
05:21:05,380 --> 05:21:11,409
It wasn't.

2757
05:21:11,409 --> 05:21:19,439
Okay, remove about 15 seconds because of that.

2758
05:21:19,439 --> 05:21:23,619
Open going in.

2759
05:21:23,619 --> 05:21:28,840
Something wrong.

2760
05:21:28,840 --> 05:21:32,529
Obi-Wan going in.

2761
05:21:33,090 --> 05:21:39,880
Okay, very cool.

2762
05:21:40,439 --> 05:21:46,099
Opening it.

2763
05:21:49,299 --> 05:21:52,770
It's not ready yet.

2764
05:21:52,770 --> 05:21:54,049
It's not ready yet.

2765
05:21:54,049 --> 05:21:56,000
It's been like a minute.

2766
05:21:56,000 --> 05:21:56,880
It's no, it hasn't.

2767
05:21:58,000 --> 05:21:58,880
We're not ready yet.

2768
05:21:58,880 --> 05:22:14,630
That was cute.

2769
05:22:14,630 --> 05:22:20,680
It's been over a minute.

2770
05:22:20,680 --> 05:22:21,319
It's we're not.

2771
05:22:21,319 --> 05:22:22,279
I'm okay.

2772
05:22:23,380 --> 05:22:26,500
Now, how long has it been since I did that?

2773
05:22:26,500 --> 05:22:27,139
Two, three minutes?

2774
05:22:27,779 --> 05:22:43,540
Jedi one.

2775
05:22:44,819 --> 05:23:00,659
Is there German noises?

2776
05:23:00,659 --> 05:23:01,139
What do you mean?

2777
05:23:05,810 --> 05:23:06,450
No, they're not.

2778
05:23:07,169 --> 05:23:25,799
How about, I'm so bad at making real names.

2779
05:23:29,169 --> 05:23:35,439
Darth, Darth Vader Jr.

2780
05:23:38,720 --> 05:23:39,279
I hate it.

2781
05:23:39,840 --> 05:23:42,130
Wait, aren't I playing as Obi-Wan?

2782
05:23:46,560 --> 05:23:47,279
Why would I need?

2783
05:23:47,279 --> 05:23:48,479
Why wouldn't I just be Obi-Wan?

2784
05:23:53,560 --> 05:23:54,680
This doesn't matter.

2785
05:23:54,680 --> 05:24:03,830
No, that's lame.

2786
05:24:18,360 --> 05:24:22,310
All right, here we go.

2787
05:24:38,259 --> 05:24:39,779
Real FMV cutscene.

2788
05:24:39,779 --> 05:24:44,000
Are we going to get a beep?

2789
05:24:44,000 --> 05:24:44,639
Yes, we are.

2790
05:24:50,599 --> 05:25:06,919
Obi-Wan, for thousands of years,

2791
05:25:07,639 --> 05:25:13,560
the Jedi Knights have served the Republic as defenders of peace

2792
05:25:14,520 --> 05:25:15,400
and justice throughout-

2793
05:25:15,400 --> 05:25:17,000
A little bit faster on the prompter, please.

2794
05:25:17,000 --> 05:25:17,720
The galaxy.

2795
05:25:21,119 --> 05:25:23,119
Young Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi,

2796
05:25:23,680 --> 05:25:27,520
who studies to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight,

2797
05:25:28,340 --> 05:25:30,740
must prove himself to his master,

2798
05:25:31,380 --> 05:25:32,180
Qui-Gon Jinn,

2799
05:25:32,979 --> 05:25:34,020
and the Jedi Council.

2800
05:25:37,939 --> 05:25:45,060
As part of his ongoing training,

2801
05:25:45,060 --> 05:25:49,779
Obi-Wan is commissioned by Maze

2802
05:25:49,779 --> 05:25:52,580
when due to investigate the rise of a dangerous new threat

2803
05:25:52,580 --> 05:25:54,419
in the lower levels of Kurosan.

2804
05:25:55,220 --> 05:26:03,779
Hover over that X.

2805
05:26:03,779 --> 05:26:04,659
Hover over that X.

2806
05:26:04,659 --> 05:26:05,860
I know, I saw you do it.

2807
05:26:06,500 --> 05:26:07,619
You didn't click it, though.

2808
05:26:07,619 --> 05:26:08,740
Some of you did.

2809
05:26:08,740 --> 05:26:12,389
Some of you were just like,

2810
05:26:12,389 --> 05:26:14,389
I want to see this stupid fucking Star Wars game,

2811
05:26:14,389 --> 05:26:17,669
but I wish you would stop talking.

2812
05:26:17,669 --> 05:26:18,549
I got you, don't worry.

2813
05:26:18,549 --> 05:26:22,610
Everything has been quiet, Master.

2814
05:26:22,610 --> 05:26:24,209
Nothing unusual to report.

2815
05:26:24,209 --> 05:26:26,369
Are you sure my presence here is necessary?

2816
05:26:27,330 --> 05:26:42,229
Yes, Master.

2817
05:26:42,229 --> 05:26:44,389
There is an Elkhart transport station nearby.

2818
05:26:48,549 --> 05:26:49,750
Why are you holding him?

2819
05:26:49,750 --> 05:26:49,990
What?

2820
05:26:50,950 --> 05:26:53,139
I thought, aren't we like Batman?

2821
05:26:53,139 --> 05:26:55,139
We don't use the powers unless it's necessary?

2822
05:26:56,180 --> 05:26:56,419
What?

2823
05:27:00,259 --> 05:27:01,220
Why am I doing this?

2824
05:27:02,479 --> 05:27:03,599
He's screaming help.

2825
05:27:10,020 --> 05:27:21,680
That guy's got a golf club.

2826
05:27:21,680 --> 05:27:22,959
Why would you even come over here?

2827
05:27:46,240 --> 05:27:48,310
What's the mission?

2828
05:27:58,759 --> 05:27:59,880
What am I doing?

2829
05:28:01,560 --> 05:28:03,360
What is he doing?

2830
05:28:03,360 --> 05:28:04,240
Wait, what is it?

2831
05:28:04,240 --> 05:28:05,119
Why can you do this?

2832
05:28:05,919 --> 05:28:06,880
Why can I do this?

2833
05:28:07,759 --> 05:28:08,799
I missed everything.

2834
05:28:08,799 --> 05:28:10,560
It was just like, oh, I'll be one.

2835
05:28:11,599 --> 05:28:13,599
Go over this way, and that's all I heard.

2836
05:28:14,639 --> 05:28:20,020
I only have four attempts remaining.

2837
05:28:20,020 --> 05:28:32,840
I don't know what just happened.

2838
05:28:32,840 --> 05:28:34,200
You're supposed to be the good guy.

2839
05:28:34,200 --> 05:28:35,159
Well, what happened?

2840
05:28:36,200 --> 05:28:37,000
We need to see that again.

2841
05:28:37,000 --> 05:28:41,319
I need to fully focus on what's happening.

2842
05:28:41,319 --> 05:28:41,819
Okay.

2843
05:28:45,569 --> 05:28:45,970
Look out.

2844
05:28:45,970 --> 05:28:46,290
Okay.

2845
05:28:46,290 --> 05:28:47,169
So what if I just don't?

2846
05:28:53,750 --> 05:28:55,189
Okay, that's enough.

2847
05:29:06,180 --> 05:29:07,459
I didn't want to kill that guy.

2848
05:29:11,680 --> 05:29:16,119
I think I was doing the right thing.

2849
05:29:16,119 --> 05:29:16,919
I just jumped.

2850
05:29:30,680 --> 05:29:32,599
This game is fucking pretty good.

2851
05:29:32,599 --> 05:29:33,479
This game is good.

2852
05:29:51,169 --> 05:29:53,490
I'm back to defend the order.

2853
05:30:09,799 --> 05:30:11,240
You ever see people do that shit?

2854
05:30:11,880 --> 05:30:12,840
I've seen videos.

2855
05:30:12,840 --> 05:30:15,000
If it's like, oh, look at somebody doing back handsprings.

2856
05:30:15,560 --> 05:30:16,200
This many.

2857
05:30:19,590 --> 05:30:20,310
Don't you?

2858
05:30:20,310 --> 05:30:20,950
You know what I'm talking about?

2859
05:30:20,950 --> 05:30:21,990
Like during like a musical,

2860
05:30:21,990 --> 05:30:24,069
they'll just kind of go across the screen.

2861
05:30:24,069 --> 05:30:25,750
It's like, doesn't that make you feel sick?

2862
05:30:26,630 --> 05:30:29,700
I would feel so awful after that.

2863
05:30:33,509 --> 05:30:36,229
You have to, you can only backflip only run.

2864
05:30:36,950 --> 05:30:37,450
Fine.

2865
05:30:46,919 --> 05:30:49,000
You wouldn't believe how hard it is to actually get that done.

2866
05:31:07,139 --> 05:31:07,700
Who needs help?

2867
05:31:11,060 --> 05:31:28,080
I don't know.

2868
05:31:28,080 --> 05:31:29,119
Is it safe to go down here?

2869
05:31:47,970 --> 05:31:48,450
Boss fight.

2870
05:31:49,090 --> 05:31:55,669
Front flip Andy.

2871
05:32:01,919 --> 05:32:03,360
Over here.

2872
05:32:04,580 --> 05:32:05,139
What?

2873
05:32:05,139 --> 05:32:06,139
How about?

2874
05:32:28,520 --> 05:32:29,319
Take this.

2875
05:32:29,319 --> 05:32:45,409
Did I get it?

2876
05:32:45,409 --> 05:32:46,450
Why can you do that?

2877
05:32:56,240 --> 05:32:57,919
Guys, I gotta be honest.

2878
05:32:57,919 --> 05:33:00,159
I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.

2879
05:33:03,569 --> 05:33:04,209
New objective.

2880
05:33:04,209 --> 05:33:07,090
Clearly obstruction that is blocking the transport.

2881
05:33:07,090 --> 05:33:07,810
Are you a bad guy?

2882
05:33:39,110 --> 05:33:40,310
How do I do Jedi moves?

2883
05:33:42,069 --> 05:33:42,569
Like that.

2884
05:33:44,790 --> 05:33:45,349
Hold on.

2885
05:33:45,349 --> 05:33:46,150
I can pick that up.

2886
05:33:48,319 --> 05:33:51,319
Holy shit.

2887
05:33:51,319 --> 05:33:51,819
All right.

2888
05:33:53,080 --> 05:33:54,840
Transfer at council stop.

2889
05:33:54,840 --> 05:33:55,560
What's going on here?

2890
05:34:00,900 --> 05:34:04,599
Okay.

2891
05:34:04,599 --> 05:34:05,560
All right.

2892
05:34:05,560 --> 05:34:06,060
So go.

2893
05:34:09,509 --> 05:34:10,009
It's not.

2894
05:34:14,959 --> 05:34:17,380
Wait, you have a big health bar.

2895
05:34:34,080 --> 05:34:35,200
I suck.

2896
05:34:35,200 --> 05:35:01,990
Just needed a little extra time.

2897
05:35:01,990 --> 05:35:12,040
I think the disc was spinning.

2898
05:35:12,040 --> 05:35:15,650
We've identified the group that attacked you as the black.

2899
05:35:15,650 --> 05:35:19,919
According to the authorities, they are a group of wanted criminals who up to this point have

2900
05:35:19,919 --> 05:35:25,080
been involved in this sudden escalation in their criminal activity is most concerned.

2901
05:35:25,080 --> 05:35:26,360
I thought that was Yoda talking for a second.

2902
05:35:26,360 --> 05:35:26,919
I was like, what?

2903
05:35:26,919 --> 05:35:27,560
That's Yoda?

2904
05:35:39,159 --> 05:35:43,779
Yoda looked like ruffled up piece of paper.

2905
05:35:43,779 --> 05:35:47,560
I'm sorry, but he did.

2906
05:36:02,799 --> 05:36:03,299
Okay.

2907
05:36:03,919 --> 05:36:11,430
Hello.

2908
05:36:11,430 --> 05:36:19,669
Wait, the robot was a Sith?

2909
05:36:20,560 --> 05:36:21,759
Wait, what is this?

2910
05:37:00,599 --> 05:37:08,740
I'm sorry, but do not give anybody in our group a red lightsaber.

2911
05:37:08,740 --> 05:37:11,330
Are you out of your mind?

2912
05:37:11,330 --> 05:37:13,509
Why did you give him a red lightsaber?

2913
05:37:13,590 --> 05:37:14,549
Give him green.

2914
05:37:16,319 --> 05:37:17,200
Red is evil.

2915
05:37:26,099 --> 05:37:29,060
I'd be able to handle it though.

2916
05:37:29,060 --> 05:37:31,919
I would have a red lightsaber, but I would be good.

2917
05:37:31,919 --> 05:37:34,290
I could handle it.

2918
05:37:34,290 --> 05:37:37,250
I would have a red lightsaber and it'd be dark and mysterious,

2919
05:37:37,250 --> 05:37:38,450
but I would still be a good guy.

2920
05:37:41,000 --> 05:37:42,180
That's me.

2921
05:38:05,830 --> 05:38:07,270
Well, this is where this playthrough ends.

2922
05:38:07,270 --> 05:38:12,319
You can monitor the informant on your

2923
05:38:12,319 --> 05:38:20,240
What was with the early 2000s and having games have just hard fail stealth missions?

2924
05:38:20,240 --> 05:38:20,880
Is that what this is?

2925
05:38:27,799 --> 05:38:28,360
Did I lose?

2926
05:38:32,319 --> 05:38:32,880
It's not.

2927
05:38:49,700 --> 05:38:50,419
What did I do?

2928
05:38:53,400 --> 05:38:54,119
It is.

2929
05:38:54,119 --> 05:38:59,729
It's a fucking hard fail stealth mission and they were obsessed with these

2930
05:38:59,729 --> 05:39:01,169
back in the early 2000s.

2931
05:39:01,169 --> 05:39:01,669
Why?

2932
05:39:02,630 --> 05:39:03,830
Nobody wanted to do this.

2933
05:39:05,029 --> 05:39:07,990
Hard fail stealth missions are the worst of the worst.

2934
05:39:07,990 --> 05:39:09,029
The worst offender.

2935
05:39:18,310 --> 05:39:18,810
What?

2936
05:39:19,669 --> 05:39:21,750
No, I didn't even get to start them.

2937
05:39:21,750 --> 05:39:22,549
No, fuck you.

2938
05:39:24,610 --> 05:39:25,889
You don't get to sound the alarm.

2939
05:39:26,689 --> 05:39:28,770
Anybody come near this button, you're dead.

2940
05:39:29,409 --> 05:39:30,790
I'm just saying.

2941
05:39:33,599 --> 05:39:41,729
Nobody's pressing this.

2942
05:39:56,950 --> 05:39:57,590
You know what?

2943
05:39:57,590 --> 05:39:58,389
I can break it.

2944
05:39:58,389 --> 05:39:59,189
Fuck that, let's go.

2945
05:40:12,759 --> 05:40:19,159
Okay, I'm fine.

2946
05:40:19,159 --> 05:40:20,439
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

2947
05:40:25,919 --> 05:40:31,540
Just destroy all their alarm system shit and nobody can do anything.

2948
05:41:20,560 --> 05:41:22,709
That's gonna kill me.

2949
05:41:22,709 --> 05:41:25,189
No, it's not.

2950
05:41:25,189 --> 05:41:26,549
Infiltrate the lower levels.

2951
05:41:33,889 --> 05:41:34,849
I need a lower level.

2952
05:41:37,490 --> 05:41:43,009
What was that?

2953
05:41:43,650 --> 05:41:45,090
Holy shit, you got me.

2954
05:41:46,770 --> 05:41:50,000
Did I do it?

2955
05:41:57,430 --> 05:41:58,549
Is there anywhere lower to go?

2956
05:42:23,590 --> 05:42:25,590
Come here.

2957
05:42:43,270 --> 05:42:43,770
More!

2958
05:42:45,080 --> 05:42:45,580
More!

2959
05:42:52,479 --> 05:42:53,439
He's bloodthirsty.

2960
05:42:54,319 --> 05:42:57,479
Minus two plus two right next to each other.

2961
05:42:57,479 --> 05:42:57,979
Rare.

2962
05:43:07,959 --> 05:43:12,610
They're really quiet.

2963
05:43:33,639 --> 05:43:42,159
Did I push him even further?

2964
05:43:45,560 --> 05:43:46,840
Wait, this could happen to me too.

2965
05:43:47,720 --> 05:43:57,939
One more layer.

2966
05:44:04,549 --> 05:44:12,630
Do not.

2967
05:44:12,630 --> 05:44:21,799
What kind of lightsaber would you have?

2968
05:44:22,520 --> 05:44:30,439
I would want like two small lightsabers and have them be like Raphael from Ninja Turtles.

2969
05:44:32,759 --> 05:44:41,319
No, I would want a throwing knives made out of lightsaber.

2970
05:44:52,549 --> 05:44:54,549
I would have an ice blue lightsaber.

2971
05:44:54,549 --> 05:44:55,049
Nice.

2972
05:44:57,029 --> 05:44:57,669
Nice, dude.

2973
05:45:15,080 --> 05:45:17,319
This game is kind of fun and I'll tell you why.

2974
05:45:17,319 --> 05:45:19,400
Because the right analog is swing.

2975
05:45:20,200 --> 05:45:24,040
Remember that trend back in the early 2000s where every single game had to have

2976
05:45:24,040 --> 05:45:28,200
movement with the right stick to attack and fight and stuff?

2977
05:45:28,200 --> 05:45:29,240
It actually works kind of well here.

2978
05:45:29,240 --> 05:45:29,720
It's kind of fun.

2979
05:45:32,040 --> 05:45:47,490
That's why I loved this as a kid.

2980
05:45:48,450 --> 05:46:13,540
When do I unlock a horse coat?

2981
05:46:13,540 --> 05:46:15,299
Imagine doing this actually stealth.

2982
05:46:15,299 --> 05:46:17,060
This would be such a boring mission.

2983
05:46:17,860 --> 05:46:19,060
It would take so long.

2984
05:46:19,060 --> 05:46:20,340
This is layer five.

2985
05:46:21,159 --> 05:46:22,279
This would be awful.

2986
05:46:35,779 --> 05:46:37,060
How would you even do this stealth?

2987
05:46:48,560 --> 05:46:49,599
That's it?

2988
05:46:49,599 --> 05:46:50,319
That didn't heal.

2989
05:46:50,319 --> 05:46:51,119
That was not even...

2990
05:46:52,000 --> 05:46:54,319
The health I just gained was just removed.

2991
05:46:55,360 --> 05:47:09,509
That's it?

2992
05:47:09,509 --> 05:47:10,310
That's so bad.

2993
05:47:19,040 --> 05:47:35,189
I'm okay.

2994
05:47:35,189 --> 05:47:35,689
Secret?

2995
05:47:48,340 --> 05:47:50,180
There are lightsaber helicopters?

2996
05:47:50,180 --> 05:47:50,900
What?

2997
05:47:50,900 --> 05:48:10,020
All right, I got the bar on the bottom right is 100% getting burned in.

2998
05:48:10,020 --> 05:48:13,270
Yep, because it's already there.

2999
05:48:13,270 --> 05:48:17,040
I have like three different games sort of burnt in.

3000
05:48:17,040 --> 05:48:21,880
This health and mana, whatever it is, is burnt in right now.

3001
05:48:21,880 --> 05:48:28,470
Thankfully, after the monitor was off for the whole evening, it was fine.

3002
05:48:29,430 --> 05:48:30,310
I'm not concerned about it.

3003
05:48:31,029 --> 05:48:32,389
I'm not worried about it.

3004
05:48:43,400 --> 05:48:45,479
How come they're talking like Lord of the Rings characters?

3005
05:48:46,930 --> 05:48:47,810
Back off, scum.

3006
05:48:51,040 --> 05:48:51,520
Man fell.

3007
05:48:52,159 --> 05:48:53,040
How come they...

3008
05:48:53,040 --> 05:48:54,639
Don't lose because I didn't save the game.

3009
05:49:03,380 --> 05:49:04,180
You spawned.

3010
05:49:04,180 --> 05:49:05,779
That's absolutely bullshit.

3011
05:49:42,720 --> 05:49:59,830
Where do I start from here before I freak out?

3012
05:49:59,830 --> 05:50:00,330
Where...

3013
05:50:00,950 --> 05:50:01,509
I don't know.

3014
05:50:01,509 --> 05:50:01,990
Where am I?

3015
05:50:02,549 --> 05:50:03,110
Is this bad?

3016
05:50:20,200 --> 05:50:22,680
I'm making it read the discs so hard right now.

3017
05:50:53,880 --> 05:50:55,639
Hey, hey boys, go!

3018
05:51:11,650 --> 05:51:12,150
What?

3019
05:51:17,479 --> 05:51:17,979
What's...

3020
05:51:36,919 --> 05:51:37,799
I spawned a secret.

3021
05:51:57,060 --> 05:51:58,500
Game just crashed.

3022
05:51:58,500 --> 05:52:00,849
Oh shit.

3023
05:52:01,569 --> 05:52:04,919
Who's this?

3024
05:52:17,540 --> 05:52:19,939
That was the person I was supposed to save.

3025
05:52:22,020 --> 05:52:27,270
Why were they just staring at me?

3026
05:52:27,270 --> 05:52:35,720
You killed the hostage.

3027
05:52:35,720 --> 05:52:36,520
Why wouldn't you be like,

3028
05:52:36,520 --> 05:52:38,279
Obi-Wan, over here, save me?

3029
05:52:40,759 --> 05:52:43,080
All right, I think I've had just about enough.

3030
05:53:02,099 --> 05:53:04,099
Something's wrong, by the way.

3031
05:53:04,099 --> 05:53:04,819
Something's wrong.

3032
05:53:05,459 --> 05:53:06,740
We lost contact.

3033
05:53:06,740 --> 05:53:07,779
How did you lose contact?

3034
05:53:07,779 --> 05:53:09,220
Does the guy have an earpiece?

3035
05:53:09,220 --> 05:53:10,500
What are you talking about?

3036
05:53:56,340 --> 05:53:57,380
Can't just...

3037
05:53:57,380 --> 05:53:58,740
Why is there no cutscene?

3038
05:54:02,479 --> 05:54:04,000
Why is there no cutscene?

3039
05:54:04,799 --> 05:54:05,299
Why is...

3040
05:54:06,319 --> 05:54:08,799
Why is there no cutscene?

3041
05:54:08,799 --> 05:54:10,479
Okay, I can't fuck this up again.

3042
05:54:12,500 --> 05:54:15,299
I can't fuck this up like a ninth time.

3043
05:54:23,240 --> 05:54:23,799
Just do it...

3044
05:54:23,799 --> 05:54:24,520
Get it right.

3045
05:54:25,240 --> 05:54:26,360
All right, I have a plan.

3046
05:54:30,630 --> 05:54:31,669
Why would they shoot him?

3047
05:54:32,709 --> 05:54:33,750
Whatever, just run.

3048
05:54:34,470 --> 05:54:36,229
And then when I get down to the second level,

3049
05:54:36,229 --> 05:54:37,270
I'm just gonna kill everybody.

3050
05:54:37,990 --> 05:54:40,610
And another thing.

3051
05:55:02,630 --> 05:55:03,349
Don't fuck it up.

3052
05:55:05,889 --> 05:55:07,090
Do not screw this up.

3053
05:55:07,090 --> 05:55:07,650
Take it easy.

3054
05:55:07,650 --> 05:55:08,209
Take it slow.

3055
05:55:09,090 --> 05:55:10,049
Full health.

3056
05:55:10,049 --> 05:55:11,090
Lightsaber out.

3057
05:55:11,090 --> 05:55:13,009
That means it's I am ready.

3058
05:55:13,889 --> 05:55:15,250
And let's go.

3059
05:55:15,970 --> 05:55:33,090
Why would they...

3060
05:55:34,720 --> 05:55:35,220
Shit.

3061
05:55:36,880 --> 05:55:38,529
Where is he?

3062
05:55:38,529 --> 05:55:39,009
Where'd he go?

3063
05:55:39,569 --> 05:55:40,849
Why is he not sitting in the middle?

3064
05:55:41,830 --> 05:55:42,549
Where did the guy go?

3065
05:55:53,520 --> 05:55:55,439
You weren't even tied up this whole time?

3066
05:56:01,619 --> 05:56:02,340
Excuse me?

3067
05:56:04,419 --> 05:56:04,819
What do I...

3068
05:56:05,619 --> 05:56:08,770
What is this guy saying?

3069
05:56:09,889 --> 05:56:10,689
What are you saying?

3070
05:56:12,310 --> 05:56:13,270
Oh, don't come near me.

3071
05:56:13,270 --> 05:56:13,750
Don't come near me.

3072
05:56:13,750 --> 05:56:14,470
What do I do?

3073
05:56:14,470 --> 05:56:15,430
What do I have to do with this?

3074
05:56:21,639 --> 05:56:23,000
You need to die right now.

3075
05:56:35,889 --> 05:56:37,090
You speak perfect English?

3076
05:56:39,330 --> 05:56:40,689
Like very eloquently.

3077
05:56:43,169 --> 05:56:44,340
What's going on?

3078
05:57:05,240 --> 05:57:07,799
This game is just kind of chaos.

3079
05:57:07,799 --> 05:57:09,799
I kind of love it.

3080
05:57:09,799 --> 05:57:12,119
Man, some real bangers tonight.

3081
05:57:12,119 --> 05:57:15,319
I don't think there was a game that I didn't even slow at all.

3082
05:57:15,319 --> 05:57:16,279
These were all bangers.

3083
05:57:16,279 --> 05:57:17,080
All of them.

3084
05:57:17,080 --> 05:57:18,279
Damn Xbox.

3085
05:57:18,279 --> 05:57:20,099
Xbox, you got some good shit.

3086
05:57:50,790 --> 05:57:51,290
Uh-oh.

3087
05:57:52,310 --> 05:57:52,810
Uh-oh.

3088
05:58:00,369 --> 05:58:01,250
I can't wait to hear it.

3089
05:58:01,250 --> 05:58:01,889
Here it comes.

3090
05:58:14,799 --> 05:58:17,669
I could do that this whole time?

3091
05:58:20,470 --> 05:58:24,849
That's scary, isn't it?

3092
05:58:42,580 --> 05:58:45,599
Where do I go from here?

3093
05:58:57,750 --> 05:58:59,110
Kind of hard to hit, aren't I?

3094
05:59:07,439 --> 05:59:08,560
Where am I supposed to go?

3095
05:59:09,360 --> 05:59:15,360
This is not connected to anything, is it?

3096
05:59:16,240 --> 05:59:16,740
Oh.

3097
06:00:06,630 --> 06:00:18,200
Don't.

3098
06:00:18,200 --> 06:00:18,700
Don't.

3099
06:00:32,069 --> 06:00:32,950
God damn it.

3100
06:00:32,950 --> 06:00:33,349
I'm okay.

3101
06:01:32,659 --> 06:01:33,779
These guys are so hard.

3102
06:01:33,779 --> 06:01:34,740
All right, get me out of here.

3103
06:02:02,580 --> 06:02:09,189
Don't even have to let him do it himself.

3104
06:02:20,869 --> 06:02:23,590
You did the Dark Souls PvP near the ledge thing.

3105
06:02:23,590 --> 06:02:24,310
We've all been there.

3106
06:02:24,950 --> 06:02:25,450
Sucks.

3107
06:02:51,439 --> 06:02:58,279
But surely the process of synthesizing cortosis into armor and weapons is far too

3108
06:02:58,279 --> 06:03:00,919
expensive and sophisticated by the Jinhal.

3109
06:03:00,919 --> 06:03:02,720
Those be involved.

3110
06:03:02,720 --> 06:03:06,000
It is well you succeeded in placing a tracker on their ship.

3111
06:03:06,000 --> 06:03:09,759
You're sending Master's Klo Koon and Eeth Koth to investigate.

3112
06:03:09,759 --> 06:03:11,119
We shall soon learn more.

3113
06:03:11,119 --> 06:03:15,090
Now to proceed to the trial arena, Obi-Wan.

3114
06:03:15,090 --> 06:03:17,009
You must be prepared.

3115
06:03:17,009 --> 06:03:19,250
Somebody said that Qui-Gon looks weird.

3116
06:03:19,250 --> 06:03:21,330
Like there's something off about Qui-Gon.

3117
06:03:21,330 --> 06:03:23,409
Yeah, something's off about Qui-Gon's model.

3118
06:03:24,290 --> 06:03:39,330
Another another Sith Lord robot by any chance.

3119
06:03:47,959 --> 06:03:48,459
Okay.

3120
06:03:51,669 --> 06:03:52,169
Hi.

3121
06:03:52,709 --> 06:03:53,909
So what do you want to teach me?

3122
06:03:55,029 --> 06:03:56,869
Now, okay, that hurt for real.

3123
06:03:56,869 --> 06:03:57,830
That hurt for real.

3124
06:03:58,389 --> 06:04:00,630
I just want to make sure you understand that hurt for real.

3125
06:04:01,430 --> 06:04:04,470
We're not using wooden swords.

3126
06:04:04,470 --> 06:04:40,099
What a lame fight.

3127
06:04:55,330 --> 06:04:56,290
He just killed me.

3128
06:04:57,409 --> 06:04:58,930
You killed Obi-Wan.

3129
06:04:58,930 --> 06:05:00,770
Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.

3130
06:05:00,770 --> 06:05:02,529
When you defeat him, you will be ready.

3131
06:05:03,779 --> 06:05:06,099
You would like to try again, Padawan.

3132
06:05:06,099 --> 06:05:07,860
You're going to revive me?

3133
06:05:11,599 --> 06:05:16,560
Use force lightning?

3134
06:05:16,560 --> 06:05:18,000
That's what I would want more than anything.

3135
06:05:18,639 --> 06:05:19,759
I don't want a lightsaber.

3136
06:05:19,759 --> 06:05:25,250
I want to just be able to be like boom lightsaber.

3137
06:05:25,250 --> 06:05:26,290
That's hand to hand.

3138
06:05:26,290 --> 06:05:26,790
I don't know.

3139
06:05:27,430 --> 06:05:27,930
It hurt.

3140
06:05:31,560 --> 06:05:32,599
That was quite an intro.

3141
06:05:55,880 --> 06:05:57,639
You can't be serious.

3142
06:05:58,439 --> 06:06:04,419
Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.

3143
06:06:04,419 --> 06:06:06,099
When you defeat him, you will be ready.

3144
06:06:06,099 --> 06:06:06,900
Stop jumping.

3145
06:06:06,900 --> 06:06:07,459
What the fuck?

3146
06:06:07,459 --> 06:06:08,740
I like to try again.

3147
06:06:08,740 --> 06:06:11,220
It's just mapped to A and I press A all the time.

3148
06:06:11,860 --> 06:06:13,159
I'll get it right now.

3149
06:06:16,040 --> 06:06:17,799
Where's like where's force bite?

3150
06:06:19,430 --> 06:06:33,779
Didn't expect that, did you?

3151
06:06:35,799 --> 06:06:38,919
Your little WWE entrance got interrupted, didn't it?

3152
06:07:06,580 --> 06:07:07,080
Stop.

3153
06:07:08,860 --> 06:07:09,360
It's hard.

3154
06:07:14,889 --> 06:07:16,810
Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.

3155
06:07:16,810 --> 06:07:18,490
When you defeat him, you will be ready.

3156
06:07:19,740 --> 06:07:26,330
You would like to try again, Padawan.

3157
06:07:26,330 --> 06:07:28,090
Oh, I'm not a journalist.

3158
06:07:28,729 --> 06:07:32,729
And there are tons of very talented game journalists out there.

3159
06:07:32,729 --> 06:07:36,279
A lot of them, tons of them.

3160
06:07:36,279 --> 06:07:36,919
You don't know any.

3161
06:07:36,919 --> 06:07:37,479
What do you know?

3162
06:07:46,250 --> 06:07:47,930
I tried to just kill this guy.

3163
06:07:48,889 --> 06:07:50,889
That was not a sparring move.

3164
06:07:50,889 --> 06:07:53,130
I'm trying to bury this into your head.

3165
06:08:41,349 --> 06:08:50,299
I think I should end this game now.

3166
06:08:50,299 --> 06:08:51,099
Don't be a weirdo.

3167
06:08:52,139 --> 06:08:55,319
Sai Sith Tim gives no quarter.

3168
06:08:55,319 --> 06:08:57,080
When you defeat him, you will be ready.

3169
06:08:58,310 --> 06:09:02,020
You would like to try again, Padawan.

3170
06:09:02,020 --> 06:09:02,659
Say something.

3171
06:09:02,659 --> 06:09:03,459
I am focused.

3172
06:09:05,720 --> 06:09:07,560
Down on the right stick to parry.

3173
06:09:07,560 --> 06:09:14,709
Does that work?

3174
06:09:14,709 --> 06:09:16,150
Holding left trigger blocks.

3175
06:09:27,099 --> 06:09:27,740
I think that worked.

3176
06:09:28,540 --> 06:09:30,009
Why would they not tell me that?

3177
06:09:31,029 --> 06:09:33,509
They told me this guy was going to teach me shit.

3178
06:09:33,509 --> 06:09:34,630
And he didn't teach me anything.

3179
06:09:35,430 --> 06:09:36,950
He just walked in and started swinging at me.

3180
06:09:38,549 --> 06:09:41,110
In every other video game, it's like, let me show you something.

3181
06:09:41,110 --> 06:09:43,430
When I swing at you, what I want you to do is,

3182
06:09:43,430 --> 06:09:45,669
I want you to dodge to the left and press X, right?

3183
06:09:45,669 --> 06:09:47,590
Like, he just walked in here and attacked me.

3184
06:10:23,689 --> 06:10:27,740
The saber is most impressive.

3185
06:10:28,380 --> 06:10:31,180
The force is indeed strong in you, young Obi-Wan.

3186
06:10:31,180 --> 06:10:31,659
I get it.

3187
06:10:31,659 --> 06:10:32,380
But beware.

3188
06:10:35,659 --> 06:10:39,180
Obi-Wan, Master Tin, come quickly to the council chambers.

3189
06:10:39,180 --> 06:10:41,900
Something has happened to Master Plo Koon and Ith Koth.

3190
06:10:42,540 --> 06:10:47,080
It's a surprise birthday party.

3191
06:10:48,279 --> 06:10:48,840
This is what they did.

3192
06:10:48,840 --> 06:10:50,360
They got rid of me for a minute.

3193
06:10:50,360 --> 06:10:53,400
So they could set up the surprise birthday party.

3194
06:10:53,400 --> 06:10:55,240
Like, come quick, hurry, back to the chamber.

3195
06:10:55,240 --> 06:10:56,360
And it's going to be a big birthday cake.

3196
06:11:01,450 --> 06:11:04,810
Somebody said, who the fuck are all these people?

3197
06:11:04,810 --> 06:11:12,310
You must not consume very much Star Wars.

3198
06:11:13,430 --> 06:11:14,790
But I don't know either.

3199
06:11:14,790 --> 06:11:17,189
I know who Luke is.

3200
06:11:17,189 --> 06:11:18,790
I know who Darth Vader is.

3201
06:11:18,790 --> 06:11:21,240
I know who Qui-Gon Jinn is.

3202
06:11:21,240 --> 06:11:22,919
The situation has become very serious.

3203
06:11:22,919 --> 06:11:24,599
I know who the Ewoks are.

3204
06:11:46,009 --> 06:11:47,770
Where is he going?

3205
06:11:47,770 --> 06:11:49,130
He just walked in a circle.

3206
06:12:09,799 --> 06:12:10,520
You take the lead.

3207
06:12:11,799 --> 06:12:12,520
You take the lead.

3208
06:12:12,520 --> 06:12:12,680
Go.

3209
06:12:12,680 --> 06:12:15,639
I want to see what Master Qui-Gon Jinn can do.

3210
06:12:31,939 --> 06:12:33,299
You're kind of not very good.

3211
06:12:48,330 --> 06:13:04,099
The families are going to be so sad.

3212
06:13:04,659 --> 06:13:08,659
Watch out for snipers.

3213
06:13:09,860 --> 06:13:10,419
Snipers.

3214
06:13:12,419 --> 06:13:20,340
Hurry Obi-Wan.

3215
06:13:21,060 --> 06:13:22,020
Ow.

3216
06:13:29,270 --> 06:13:29,909
Help.

3217
06:13:29,909 --> 06:13:30,310
Help.

3218
06:13:30,310 --> 06:13:30,790
Help.

3219
06:13:30,790 --> 06:13:31,110
Help.

3220
06:13:31,110 --> 06:13:31,430
Help.

3221
06:13:32,790 --> 06:13:33,430
Help.

3222
06:13:33,430 --> 06:13:33,830
Help.

3223
06:13:34,630 --> 06:13:36,869
Help.

3224
06:13:36,869 --> 06:13:37,270
Dad.

3225
06:13:38,470 --> 06:13:40,069
I know you probably need a dad.

3226
06:13:40,069 --> 06:13:41,270
But where's the...

3227
06:13:41,270 --> 06:13:42,069
I need some help.

3228
06:13:44,069 --> 06:13:44,709
Where did he go?

3229
06:13:44,709 --> 06:13:50,970
I got sniped out of the air.

3230
06:14:00,700 --> 06:14:01,020
All right.

3231
06:14:01,020 --> 06:14:01,979
I might...

3232
06:14:01,979 --> 06:14:03,979
It might be time to call it for tonight.

3233
06:14:05,659 --> 06:14:08,099
Another one or two attempts.

3234
06:14:08,099 --> 06:14:08,580
No help.

3235
06:14:13,369 --> 06:14:14,330
Can I reflect it back?

3236
06:14:24,939 --> 06:14:25,819
There are animals here.

3237
06:14:31,240 --> 06:14:32,040
That's cool looking.

3238
06:14:37,529 --> 06:14:38,330
Where's Qui-Gon?

3239
06:14:42,380 --> 06:14:43,419
I don't think I can kill them.

3240
06:14:49,849 --> 06:14:50,569
Where's Qui-Gon?

3241
06:15:02,869 --> 06:15:03,590
Honestly, where is he?

3242
06:15:03,590 --> 06:15:04,069
Where the hell?

3243
06:15:13,659 --> 06:15:19,479
This looks like a developer area.

3244
06:15:19,479 --> 06:15:20,680
I feel like I'm not supposed to be up here.

3245
06:15:36,700 --> 06:15:37,419
Snipers.

3246
06:15:40,389 --> 06:15:41,110
What?

3247
06:15:41,110 --> 06:15:43,209
Is he in a tree?

3248
06:16:10,250 --> 06:16:10,889
Fuck off.

3249
06:16:11,770 --> 06:16:12,810
You've got to be kidding me.

3250
06:16:51,779 --> 06:16:52,259
Oh.

3251
06:16:52,259 --> 06:16:54,900
Hurry up.

3252
06:16:54,900 --> 06:16:55,220
We have to...

3253
06:17:01,990 --> 06:17:02,470
Wait, did...

3254
06:17:02,470 --> 06:17:03,750
Now let us press the attack.

3255
06:17:04,860 --> 06:17:05,259
What happened?

3256
06:17:05,259 --> 06:17:05,740
Did I...

3257
06:17:05,740 --> 06:17:07,099
Did we get teleported back?

3258
06:17:31,560 --> 06:17:32,599
I don't want to lose Qui-Gon.

3259
06:17:37,619 --> 06:17:39,619
Dude, what are you doing down here?

3260
06:17:39,619 --> 06:17:40,259
Ow.

3261
06:17:40,259 --> 06:17:40,580
Stop.

3262
06:17:54,900 --> 06:17:55,540
I'm just...

3263
06:17:55,540 --> 06:17:56,340
I'm just going.

3264
06:18:22,150 --> 06:18:22,790
No.

3265
06:18:22,790 --> 06:18:23,189
Please.

3266
06:18:26,259 --> 06:18:26,659
I'm done.

3267
06:18:27,299 --> 06:18:27,700
I'm done.

3268
06:18:27,700 --> 06:18:28,099
I'm done.

3269
06:18:28,259 --> 06:18:28,900
I'm done.

3270
06:18:28,900 --> 06:18:29,619
This was fun.

3271
06:18:29,619 --> 06:18:30,340
This was a good one.

3272
06:18:30,340 --> 06:18:32,099
This was fun, but I don't want to do this anymore.

3273
06:18:32,099 --> 06:18:33,139
This level sucks.

3274
06:18:33,779 --> 06:18:36,409
This level is just like a big green plane.

3275
06:18:36,970 --> 06:18:38,250
And you just walk forward.

3276
06:18:38,250 --> 06:18:42,409
This is like a thousand G-Mod spawned sniper people.

3277
06:18:42,409 --> 06:18:43,900
This mission is...

3278
06:18:43,900 --> 06:18:45,060
One more.

3279
06:18:47,290 --> 06:19:01,220
Token.

3280
06:19:02,419 --> 06:19:09,560
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3281
06:19:10,360 --> 06:19:11,080
I'm invincible.

3282
06:19:16,619 --> 06:19:17,900
What direction do I go?

3283
06:19:17,900 --> 06:19:18,779
What direction do I go?

3284
06:19:19,740 --> 06:19:20,139
This way?

3285
06:19:21,020 --> 06:19:23,619
That's water.

3286
06:19:23,619 --> 06:19:24,020
I'm dead.

3287
06:19:24,740 --> 06:19:36,740
I've survived my facility and discovered the source of their weapons technology.

3288
06:19:36,740 --> 06:19:39,060
We can still turn defeat into victory.

3289
06:19:39,619 --> 06:19:44,069
Can I do it?

3290
06:19:44,630 --> 06:19:45,430
I think it's beautiful.

3291
06:19:47,770 --> 06:19:48,009
Oh.

3292
06:19:56,650 --> 06:19:57,130
Oh.

3293
06:19:57,130 --> 06:20:10,520
That works.

3294
06:20:10,520 --> 06:20:14,200
Master, I found the entrance to some kind of large mining complex.

3295
06:20:16,259 --> 06:20:18,580
Undoubtedly a cortosis mine.

3296
06:20:18,580 --> 06:20:22,180
I'll wait till there's some kind of manufacturing plant inside.

3297
06:20:22,180 --> 06:20:24,659
See what kind of evidence you could gather down there.

3298
06:20:24,659 --> 06:20:30,340
I'm not sure.

3299
06:20:30,340 --> 06:20:31,220
I'm not sure.

3300
06:20:31,220 --> 06:20:35,220
I'm not sure.

3301
06:20:37,430 --> 06:20:41,000
I'm not sure.

3302
06:20:41,880 --> 06:20:42,759
I'm not sure.

3303
06:21:51,959 --> 06:21:52,439
I'm done.

3304
06:21:52,439 --> 06:21:53,080
I'll see you later.

3305
06:21:55,259 --> 06:21:55,740
I'm done.

3306
06:21:57,020 --> 06:21:58,139
End of the stream run.

3307
06:21:58,139 --> 06:21:59,259
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

3308
06:22:01,720 --> 06:22:02,599
One more.

3309
06:22:02,599 --> 06:22:03,080
One more.

3310
06:22:03,080 --> 06:22:05,000
We'll go out last when I try to run through it.

3311
06:22:05,000 --> 06:22:06,970
But do another game?

3312
06:22:07,689 --> 06:22:08,650
This is so much fun.

3313
06:22:09,450 --> 06:22:10,169
Don't worry.

3314
06:22:10,169 --> 06:22:10,889
We're doing this again.

3315
06:22:12,200 --> 06:22:12,680
Very soon.

3316
06:22:14,490 --> 06:22:15,450
One last run through.

3317
06:22:33,799 --> 06:22:54,549
How did I fall the second fucking time?

3318
06:22:55,270 --> 06:23:03,619
How did I fall the second time?

3319
06:23:06,619 --> 06:23:07,020
All right.

3320
06:23:07,020 --> 06:23:07,500
That's it.

3321
06:23:07,500 --> 06:23:07,979
That was fun.

3322
06:23:09,880 --> 06:23:11,080
A raid just came in too.

3323
06:23:11,080 --> 06:23:12,520
Well, thanks for the raid.

3324
06:23:12,520 --> 06:23:13,319
Welcome.

3325
06:23:13,319 --> 06:23:16,409
We are ending right this very moment.

3326
06:23:16,970 --> 06:23:22,619
That was console gaming weekend and there is...

3327
06:23:23,259 --> 06:23:25,689
So remember when I said the reason why I was doing this

3328
06:23:25,689 --> 06:23:28,490
is because I wanted to get through some of the ones

3329
06:23:28,490 --> 06:23:29,610
that I didn't do years ago?

3330
06:23:30,169 --> 06:23:33,700
Like, oh, I still have like 10 or so 15 games to play, right?

3331
06:23:34,500 --> 06:23:36,900
Well, I added 30, 40, 50 more.

3332
06:23:37,700 --> 06:23:41,139
So now instead of having 10 or 15 to do left,

3333
06:23:41,139 --> 06:23:43,540
there's like still like 25.

3334
06:23:44,569 --> 06:23:45,369
I added more.

3335
06:23:50,200 --> 06:23:51,400
We got caught on somebody.

3336
06:23:51,400 --> 06:23:51,799
There was two.

3337
06:23:51,799 --> 06:23:52,279
They were fun.

3338
06:23:52,840 --> 06:23:54,680
Hey, you get caught on them.

3339
06:23:54,680 --> 06:23:55,000
That's fine.

3340
06:23:55,560 --> 06:23:58,119
Do a DS scream.

3341
06:23:58,119 --> 06:24:02,009
I probably will eventually.

3342
06:24:02,009 --> 06:24:03,369
I want to do N64 as well.

3343
06:24:05,619 --> 06:24:06,340
Ratchet and Clank.

3344
06:24:10,069 --> 06:24:11,110
We are doing this again.

3345
06:24:12,580 --> 06:24:14,659
I'm just going to make another pile and just move stuff

3346
06:24:14,659 --> 06:24:17,450
we've already played to another section

3347
06:24:17,450 --> 06:24:19,130
so I don't accidentally do it again.

3348
06:24:20,279 --> 06:24:21,159
That was the Xbox.

3349
06:24:21,159 --> 06:24:23,479
That was Xbox Night number one.

3350
06:24:23,479 --> 06:24:26,360
Probably of at least three or four,

3351
06:24:26,360 --> 06:24:28,119
judging by how much is sitting in front of me here.

3352
06:24:30,740 --> 06:24:32,580
So the next time you will see me live,

3353
06:24:34,889 --> 06:24:36,169
this is where it's going to get interesting

3354
06:24:36,169 --> 06:24:41,220
because Ster and I are going to do the Elden Ring co-op

3355
06:24:41,220 --> 06:24:42,099
this coming weekend.

3356
06:24:42,099 --> 06:24:46,380
I think either the 21st or the 22nd,

3357
06:24:46,380 --> 06:24:47,340
I think is what we were thinking.

3358
06:24:48,220 --> 06:24:50,139
So that's happening this weekend.

3359
06:24:50,139 --> 06:24:54,069
So we'll probably just come back with the Xbox

3360
06:24:54,069 --> 06:24:59,000
in a couple days on Wednesday.

3361
06:24:59,000 --> 06:25:00,520
So we'll do Wednesday Xbox

3362
06:25:01,580 --> 06:25:05,799
and then maybe Friday Xbox

3363
06:25:05,799 --> 06:25:07,080
and then whenever Elden Ring happens.

3364
06:25:07,080 --> 06:25:08,279
So I'll see you on Wednesday.

3365
06:25:08,279 --> 06:25:16,599
See you in a couple days.

3366
06:25:16,599 --> 06:25:17,479
I'm just going to keep it all here.

3367
06:25:17,479 --> 06:25:19,319
I'm not going to tear it down or anything.

3368
06:25:19,319 --> 06:25:24,380
We'll just keep going.

3369
06:25:24,380 --> 06:25:25,099
Thanks for hanging out.

3370
06:25:25,099 --> 06:25:27,290
Thanks for watching there.

3371
06:25:28,409 --> 06:25:31,319
Um, it's a ton of fun.

3372
06:25:31,319 --> 06:25:32,200
I love doing this.

3373
06:25:32,200 --> 06:25:37,750
We talked about it last night,

3374
06:25:37,750 --> 06:25:40,069
but one of the big reasons why it's so much fun to do this

3375
06:25:40,069 --> 06:25:42,860
is because you can just move on

3376
06:25:42,860 --> 06:25:44,619
or I play it for three or four hours.

3377
06:25:44,619 --> 06:25:47,080
You just kind of never know what you're going to get.

3378
06:25:47,080 --> 06:25:58,500
But yeah, and then the Elden Ring co-op stuff.

3379
06:25:58,500 --> 06:25:59,860
I don't know if we're going to do that

3380
06:25:59,860 --> 06:26:02,619
for more than a couple of days.

3381
06:26:02,619 --> 06:26:05,349
I can't imagine that's going to be something that happens.

3382
06:26:05,349 --> 06:26:10,279
I mean, we're going to do randomizer co-op.

3383
06:26:10,279 --> 06:26:13,560
It's going to be a mess.

3384
06:26:13,560 --> 06:26:15,880
But oh, I love tweet.

3385
06:26:15,880 --> 06:26:17,159
Thanks for the raid.

3386
06:26:17,159 --> 06:26:20,869
I think there were a couple of raids tonight that I missed.

3387
06:26:20,950 --> 06:26:22,979
I was too in it.

3388
06:26:22,979 --> 06:26:27,029
But if you just came from Love Tweed's stream,

3389
06:26:27,029 --> 06:26:28,310
thanks for rating.

3390
06:26:28,310 --> 06:26:32,790
Sorry that we're turning it off immediately after you get here.

3391
06:26:32,790 --> 06:26:41,880
But appreciate it.

3392
06:26:41,880 --> 06:26:44,040
Vinny's playing a Star Wars game right now, too.

3393
06:26:47,419 --> 06:26:48,299
What is Vinny doing?

3394
06:26:48,299 --> 06:26:58,419
Let's see.

3395
06:26:58,419 --> 06:27:00,419
Star Wars Dark Forces.

3396
06:27:00,419 --> 06:27:05,590
See if it's as good as Obi-Wan.

3397
06:27:05,590 --> 06:27:07,939
All right.

3398
06:27:07,939 --> 06:27:08,659
Yeah, we'll raid Vinny.

3399
06:27:08,659 --> 06:27:10,259
We haven't raided anybody in a long time.

3400
06:27:10,259 --> 06:27:11,990
So let's raid Vinny.

3401
06:27:11,990 --> 06:27:15,830
It's been at least a few weeks,

3402
06:27:15,830 --> 06:27:17,029
at least a couple of weeks.

3403
06:27:17,029 --> 06:27:28,759
Go say hello to Vinny playing Star Wars Dark Forces mod.

3404
06:27:28,759 --> 06:27:29,639
Very cool.

3405
06:27:32,900 --> 06:27:34,099
Give my best.

3406
06:27:34,099 --> 06:27:37,909
And I'll see you later.

3407
06:27:37,909 --> 06:27:39,340
See you Wednesday.

3408
06:27:39,340 --> 06:27:39,900
Good night.

3409
06:27:39,900 --> 06:27:40,619
Goodbye.

3410
06:27:40,619 --> 06:27:42,299
Call your mother.

3411
06:27:42,299 --> 06:27:43,479
See you later.

3412
06:28:17,369 --> 06:28:18,330
Oh, I'm not muted.

3413
06:28:18,889 --> 06:28:30,200
See you later.
