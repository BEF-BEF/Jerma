1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:18,329
Hey, hey, how are you doing? How are you doing? Good. I'm gonna just make a tweet real quick.

2
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:39,179
Hey, Vod Watchers. What's up? Hold in ring. All right. Screaming. I'm not gonna scream today. I

3
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,460
need to save my voice because we're going, we're gonna go hard. I can't, I can't blow my voice out

4
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,100
day one out of like two or three in a row, like 10 hours. You know what I mean? We should be collected

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:04,219
today. Tomorrow, we can do whatever we can. I can be as loud as I want, right? Okay, how about

6
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:18,500
Elden Ring? I'm ready. That sounds good. It kind of makes it sound like I'm just starting the game,

7
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:30,120
though, doesn't it? Oh, well. Okay. Welcome back. It's been a few days. I definitely wanted to take

8
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,159
a few days. I thought I was only going to need to take two days, but I got up on the third day

9
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:44,340
and was like, maybe I should just relax. Just go chill. Not scream or yell or tense my body up.

10
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,200
Here's the thing about these games, right? When you play one of these games, you don't even

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,319
realize you're doing it, but you are exercising your entire body. You are exercising your blood

12
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:03,209
vessels to everything. Every inch of your body is doing a lifting routine. Your stomach tightens

13
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:11,180
up your arms, tighten up your neck, your jaw. Guys, I woke up like the third day, my teeth hurt.

14
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,020
It was weird. It was like, wow, my teeth were exercised somehow. How

15
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:31,180
cool. People think I'm fucking whatever. I'm just fucking kidding. All the grinding. Yeah,

16
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,860
I don't know what happened, man. My teeth got a workout. It's like, no, dude, you were

17
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,169
clenching your throat. But we're going to keep playing. I know that people are going to,

18
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,729
this is an Elden Ring channel. I know. But for the first time in about half a decade,

19
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,569
there's a game that I think is really interesting and I'm going to just play the hell out of it.

20
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,250
I expect way more streams, right? Like I'm going to do three, four plus days in a row with this game.

21
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,569
I do have to be careful because I don't want to go too crazy. I'm going to go too hard.

22
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:05,210
So we'll see how I feel tonight. How long we go. We might go long today. Very long.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,780
Into the early evening hours, probably early evening. I mean, late evening, early morning.

24
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,659
We will after this weekend, even if I don't, I don't plan on beating this game

25
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:24,340
this weekend. Even if I go two, three hard kind of days in a row or like one day,

26
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,460
day off three days or something or two days, right? However, I'm going to do it.

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,979
Definitely not going to beat the game this weekend. So I got to figure out what I want

28
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:38,120
to do content wise with Elden Ring because just because there's no way I'm going to beat it.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,319
So does this just become a permanent game that happens every week or so that, you know,

30
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,439
there's just going to be an Elden Ring stream that's just going to happen as we progress

31
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,610
through the game. And we just do other stuff too in the meantime. That's a possibility too.

32
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,930
But as it stands right now, this is what we're doing. This is the plan. I'm still super into it.

33
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,979
I have not played. I did make a new character because I wanted to play, but then I stepped

34
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,419
back because that new character was way different than the character that I play on stream. I have

35
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:16,680
about 12 minutes with a new character and I just got, it's like a big two-handed swing pattern.

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,720
I didn't want to get used to that. I want to just stay muscle memory with the guy that I have.

37
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,420
Astrologer? No, the name was Mee Strong and they look like a caveman and they have a big club.

38
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,040
That's my new, one of my new characters I've been playing with off stream.

39
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,689
But yeah, let's keep going. I, this is what we're doing for the next couple of days at least.

40
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:47,860
I need to study, but I can't stop playing Elden Ring. Yeah, it'll be here though. And it's,

41
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,639
there's a lot. We also have to clean up the notes because the notes look like shit. And I also want

42
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,360
to be, make it very, very clear before we get started. I got a big zit on my face. It's huge.

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,279
It's going to be incredibly distracting for me. It's going to be, it's going to be so distracting

44
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:12,550
for you. Just know that I shaved and I had like a bunch of Elden Ring stress sits. So it's, it

45
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:20,949
looks awful. It looks really bad. I just need to get it out there because the second I turn the

46
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:27,350
camera on, all I'm going to see is in all capitals, zit. So I'm just getting in front of it because

47
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:35,029
fuck it. You know what I mean? I'm in control now, right? Like I am in control now. Yeah, I don't

48
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:44,300
know. I'm getting the Elden Ring stress sits. All right. Hold on. It's almost time. Almost time.

49
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:58,459
Hold on. Wait a second. I'm really excited to play though, because I have not played

50
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,540
my character. I went in my character's inventory very briefly. Just looked at stuff for a few

51
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:11,110
minutes, but I have not walked away from the bonfire that I was at. We, I'm in that spot and

52
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,379
I can't hide it anymore. Can't hide it anymore. People are going to see my like freshly shaven

53
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:22,980
zit face and whatever. It's okay. I'm okay with it. I'm not, I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it.

54
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,379
It's a beauty mark. It's not a, it's a beauty mark. I already said, oh fuck. It's naughty. Look,

55
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:52,279
it's fine. And then like I made it so much worse because you know, you're in the mirror like,

56
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,680
what do I do about it? And then you make it so much worse. It gets infected.

57
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,399
I like accidentally shaved it off with the razor and I was like, God damn it. And then when it was

58
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:05,720
shaved off, I'm like, wait a minute, hold on. And then I, and now it's, it's over and now it's fine.

59
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,720
This is not, this is not herpes. What are you talking about? I don't have, this is not,

60
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,699
what are you, what? All right. Time that person up for fucking 10 seconds. It's herpes. You're

61
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:32,149
gonna, now I'm going to get angry. Are you sure you're 40? Dude, anybody can get, I don't really

62
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:39,189
get that many pieces of acne anymore. Like I'm sorry. Like this is, my cortisol levels while

63
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,589
I've been playing Elden Ring have been like a hundred, a hundred percent. So I mean, of course,

64
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:49,670
but my cortisol level is increasing and my like, I'm getting like very stressed and angry and it's

65
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,430
always really sweaty in here. And I shaved, it's going to happen. Like even though you,

66
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,269
I don't even matter how old I am. By the way, you never, never ask somebody how old they are.

67
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:14,500
Are you kidding me? All right, here we go. We're going to get started. Elden Ring part four. I

68
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:23,430
don't, I don't even, I have no idea. All right, let's load game. There's a, there's me strong

69
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:30,860
and I may have, I may have, okay, this is an hour, but that's not true. That's not true. I sat,

70
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,940
I sat there testing to see if I, my laptop could handle the game. And I was doing like a temperature

71
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,179
test because my laptop, I don't think it can handle it. Cause I was thinking I could play like in bed

72
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,740
with my laptop. So I just kind of sat there and did like a temperature test to see if I could like

73
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,950
even play the game. So you're not, you guys are never going to see me strong by the way. There's

74
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:59,029
no way it's never going to happen. That's the character that I play only off stream for me.

75
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:09,320
You're not going to get to see me strong. I'm really sorry. He's addicted. No, I was addicted

76
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,850
to trying to find out if I could play it potentially like not in the bathroom. All right,

77
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,169
here we go. So we've got, what do we got? Turn it up a little bit. I can't really hear it.

78
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:29,080
Why is his name Edgward? I don't know. This is the first thing that somebody said. He's gatekeeping

79
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,629
his character from us. No, I just, that's my off stream character and I didn't want to play as him

80
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:40,629
because the swing timings are so off that I would get used to over the last two days playing with

81
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:47,129
me strong. And I would, I would get on here and I would complain to you guys that I couldn't play

82
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:50,809
right. It would be so annoying. It'd be like, no, but you don't understand this, but the swing

83
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,169
timings on my other character are so different that that's why I got hit three times. I don't

84
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,940
want to give, even give you guys the firepower for that. All right. So last thing happened,

85
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,940
I beat Loretta. I got this, which is really cool. Those of you that missed it, this is the great

86
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,659
bow. Really, really interested in how this is going to work because I feel like that's going

87
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:17,820
to be cool. What's on your face? Yeah, whatever. I knew it was going to happen. That's why I got

88
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:24,490
in front of it. You're just in that, like, if I never said anything, it would just be like,

89
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,009
it would just be like zit. I told you, and this is that person just came to the spring like five

90
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:35,240
minutes ago. All right, let's go. So last thing that I did, I beat Loretta. There's way more stuff

91
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,000
going on here. So I didn't even, I didn't even look around this area. So let me look around.

92
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:47,220
Don't listen to them. I'm not going to listen to them. Let's see what's over this way. I have

93
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,580
been very itching and excited to play this. Okay. There's this, I can go up this way,

94
00:10:51,379 --> 00:11:01,370
which seems to lead out. All right, hold on. Not yet. There's a place to go up here. We have a zit

95
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,789
cam. You mean you want me to zoom in, crop this and put it as big as the face cam and have it be

96
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:18,519
the zit. No, I want new viewers to not like write threads about how fucking annoying I am.

97
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:28,500
No, that's gross. That's just actually disgusting. That's actually gross. Like that would be that if

98
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,659
I saw somebody doing that, it'd be like, that's fucking okay. You're like trying, you're like

99
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,659
trying to really put this like, Oh, look at how gross and like weird we are. Like, no, that's

100
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:42,200
fucking I don't want to do that. Not happening. So what there's nothing here. I thought there'd be

101
00:11:42,200 --> 00:12:00,409
something important here. I guess not. Big statue, rub pizza on it and see how big it gets.

102
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:13,559
All right. Well, we're going out here, put a sensor bar on it. I move around too much. It's

103
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:21,179
not going to happen. Okay. Here we go. Three sisters, three sisters, by the way, in case,

104
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:29,429
in case anybody thought there was a problem, I've got it. A lot of you just exhale the sigh of

105
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:37,769
relief. Of course I do. There's a giant, there's literally a, there's literally a giant dragon

106
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:47,000
over there on the left. I'm going to go on the right. I have my horse frame dropped. What?

107
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:28,460
Okay. I think it's okay. I think we're okay. That may have been temporary. It might show up again.

108
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:34,649
Remember you need lip fillers. Actually, thanks for reminding me, but I don't know where it is.

109
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:44,490
Frames aren't great. I don't know. That's weird. Sometimes randomly. It seems like the last like

110
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,970
few months, once every like few weeks, we'll get like an F for like 40 minutes and then it's fine

111
00:13:50,970 --> 00:14:05,240
permanently. That's weird. Okay. Here we go. I want to go around this edge. Is this actually

112
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:18,059
the edge of the world or is there more? There's more all the way up here? No, there's not. Isn't

113
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:35,159
this the edge of the world? Oh, hold on. You sound like people that are interviewed to replace you.

114
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:49,159
Wait, you just distracted me. I said no yelling frozen armament. What is that? What is floating

115
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:57,620
over us? Why is it like a, why is there like a spaceship floating above us? That was weird. You

116
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:13,929
saw that? All right. All right. Get off. I got to check out rave side. I'm going to see what that

117
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:29,210
item is. Frozen thing. What level am I? I am. Oh shit. Hold on. Are you dead? I am level 51. 51.

118
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,759
Those of you that want to see what my loadout is, I will show it because there might be some new

119
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,929
people here that just are dropping by for the first time. Uh, I got the carrion night sword,

120
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:44,090
which scales with intelligence and dexterity, which is exactly what I'm doing. I've got the

121
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:51,480
carrion glint blade staff soon to be replaced with the Azores glint stone staff. I'm not

122
00:15:51,480 --> 00:16:04,409
overleveled dot 51. You look younger. I'm doing like a half and half kind of deck slash int weapon

123
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:16,600
build. Very happy with it so far. And we're still gone. Okay. I'm just, so somebody actually just

124
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:34,679
say again, shut up. Noob sidebar. Ooh, everybody said that. Who is saying this? I don't know. I

125
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,519
saw guys sometimes have to fill in the blanks. I get shit sometimes because people go,

126
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,679
dude, he like read half of a sentence and then just like made up the rest. Yeah, I did because

127
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:47,000
like I can't read it that fast. So if you say in your message and I catch it and it's like,

128
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,039
Hey dude, I have such a huge fan of Bert and you're like, all I can see is the B you are.

129
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,600
I'm going to be like, Oh, Burger King. Like you're a huge fan of Burger King. All right, man.

130
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:02,970
Like that's cool. I guess I'm going to fill it in. I want to see what that spell is.

131
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:12,250
Rosen armament. Enchant arm is held in the right hand with frost. Really? But I can't

132
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:25,819
enchant this weapon. That's really cool though. I kind of wish I could. Will you ever use your

133
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,859
pouch? It's actually really super useful. Um, you mean like this here? Yeah, I got to,

134
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,930
I got to figure that out. I got to figure that out. All right. So this is going this way,

135
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,640
but I don't want to go this way. There seems to be a lot of stuff this year. I have 10,000 souls.

136
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:53,380
First of all, be careful. I don't want to die. I need more of this glove war. Yes, exactly what

137
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:05,480
I wanted. I need glove war too, which is exactly what I just got. All right. This is going to lead

138
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,009
to a whole new area. All right. There was more to do in that area back here. Let me know. I don't

139
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:21,380
want to get too overwhelmed. Don't overwhelm me. Stop overwhelming me. Still dropping frames. Is

140
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,430
it still happening? It'll, it'll even out. It evened out last time. Last time there was an issue,

141
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:33,430
it was at like four or five o'clock and it resolved itself in like 30 minutes. So it should be okay.

142
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:42,140
All right. So this is where we are. I want to go back here because there's an area to go this way.

143
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:55,539
Check it out. The zip and the shave makes you look like you're 20.

144
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:14,950
Could you do a Garfield impression? Yeah, I think I could. I could try. Yeah, maybe. That's the best

145
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:26,170
you're going to get. All right. This is where I want to be. Who am I in combat with? So I want to

146
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:33,400
go over here. Let's try here first because this looks, this looks pretty interesting. Let's go.

147
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:49,099
Yep. Yep. Something in here. I haven't go in here. Renna's rise locked shut for now.

148
00:19:50,819 --> 00:20:00,900
What do you mean blocked shut for now? What? Okay. What about over here or over here? I want to check

149
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:09,460
these. Renna's rise frames. I know. I don't know why it's happening. It doesn't make any sense.

150
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,019
Okay. Let's check these places. I actually, right. I got to clean up the notepad. You're right. Let's

151
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:23,700
do that first. Uh, these, I already did this. This was that area that I got the, um,

152
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:31,059
that weird snake, uh, monster thing. I already did that. Uh, I already did that. Didn't do this

153
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:37,480
prawn guy. This sea offer thing. I did it already. This can stay and this can stay. All right. So

154
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:50,980
Renna, Renna's is closed for now. I, I guess. I don't know. It might be Twitch. I don't know.

155
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,900
It's not Twitch. This is definitely coming from my end. All right. So that's Renna's is closed

156
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,000
for now. And I guess that that's all I need to know. That's good. Let's go check out. Uh, yeah.

157
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,880
There's like a dragon over here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. First of all,

158
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:16,950
like this, I got so much shit on my map. Get rid of that. What are the crap is on here? Just one.

159
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:25,500
I don't want any more than that. How do I get rid of all markers? Four and five of the, okay.

160
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:33,750
I don't want three anymore either. All right. This, this dragon here. What am I supposed to do

161
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:42,700
about this? Just kill this. What was it? Is it a dragon? It is. Okay. Wait, I don't want to fight

162
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:55,720
that right now. I have 10,000 souls. That'd be a mistake. I'm being so rude about it. This is it.

163
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:05,819
Yeah. Tell them are you going to beat every single boss? I don't think so because I really,

164
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:09,339
I kind of want another play through to be able to have stuff that I haven't seen, which is

165
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:14,619
kind of interesting to me. So I'm going to do the ones that I find or the ones that I'm interested

166
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:29,559
in. Right. What is that? Ranny's rise. Wait, Ranny, Brenna. Oh, the three sisters. Okay. Well,

167
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:42,119
this one's open. What the hell is this? Oh, someone's going to be mad about that.

168
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,240
Imagine somebody just w I can imagine I was just wasn't here. Somebody walked into my streaming

169
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,299
setup and just took a two-handed great sword and just crashed through the middle of it and then

170
00:22:52,299 --> 00:23:14,200
left. And they didn't take anything. So what is going on in here? I wonder if I, you probably

171
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,160
have to fight the three sisters, right? I would be surprised if you didn't, especially because

172
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:28,549
there's a bonfire right here. Oh, I did my routine this morning, by the way. I did my,

173
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:38,490
I did my Elden Ring routine. The Elden Ring routine was I got up, I took a nice like warm shower.

174
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:46,089
I made a salad and this salad, by the way, is very healthy. It's half spinach, half spring mix.

175
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,450
And then just do a little bit of olive oil on that. Don't do anything else.

176
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:55,609
Eat that. Let that just get inside you. Let that like kind of coagulate inside of your body. Get

177
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:02,869
it good. Make a green tea. And here we are. Like I am actually like, I am full up. I'm ready to go.

178
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:08,420
Like that's how I play Elden Ring. I eat like a salad is absolutely awesome here. All right. Wait,

179
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:16,460
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to level up. Do I have enough to level up though?

180
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:28,890
Probably not. What is this? How much is it for me to level up? 16, 17 thousand? I don't want to die

181
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:37,210
like five times. All right. I can get 50. I can get that right now. Just give me a sec. All right.

182
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:43,609
I can come right back here. Makes me want to have some more green. Does that even count as a salad?

183
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,779
Um, yeah, of course it does. Let me just get some souls. I don't want to go up here and die

184
00:24:50,779 --> 00:25:00,490
and lose 15k. It'd be horrible. I have to fight the hand enemies again, which I said this is

185
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,849
actually not a bad idea. I, I, I was like very, very tired when I got here and very annoyed.

186
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,930
So I think now that I'm refreshed and ready to go, this is a guy I want to explore a little bit

187
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:19,240
here because this place with the hands that actually scared the fucking shit out of me.

188
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,839
That like, that was the worst one so far of the whole game, but I'm not kidding. That hurt.

189
00:25:24,839 --> 00:26:01,829
That actually hurt my body. Damn it. These enemies suck so bad. These guys are the worst.

190
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,869
Yeah. Like, what was that? You get it? Like, what was that little like, it's, it's that,

191
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,789
what is it? You know what I mean? How do you can even tell what he's even doing?

192
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:16,230
All right. There we go. Finally. That was horrible. My whole, I hurt a lot.

193
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:23,500
Okay. So this is, yeah, this is good because I can actually explore over here and not just be a

194
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:38,809
dipshit. Don't. All right. Fine. No more huge ones. Attention streamer, attention streamer,

195
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:45,769
circle behind the hands. Dude, I have to get another flask upgrade. I'm at plus one still.

196
00:26:45,769 --> 00:27:08,470
I got to get like a plus two or plus three attention streamer. Okay. I'll try it. It's

197
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:15,990
easier said than done when they take up the whole fucking goddamn screen. Don't lose these.

198
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:19,829
Oh my fucking God. These hands are the worst enemy in the whole game.

199
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:32,140
Without us, without a solitary doubt in my mind. Crystal bud. Yeah. Eat shit. Your hand.

200
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:41,289
Fuck. Yeah. You can't, you, you can't like how, what the these guys are fucking unbearable.

201
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:54,380
I couldn't even get around him. He, he, his hitbox is this. He goes, almost just dropped like a

202
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:08,089
bunch of stuff. All right. He's fire. I don't have fire. I don't have, I'm sorcery. All right. Go

203
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:19,529
ahead and come out of the ground. You fucking piece of shit. Where is he? He's like right here.

204
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:35,079
Really? Does not do very much. All right. Circle attention streamer, attention streamer,

205
00:28:35,079 --> 00:29:16,140
get around his back. Thank you. Appreciate it. He's using the joke weapon. This is not,

206
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,369
how is this a joke weapon? This thing's awesome. This is not a joke weapon.

207
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:32,180
Joke weapon? These knight swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous

208
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:39,380
battle skills. Despite numbering fewer than 20, this power made them a match for even the champions

209
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:48,809
of gold in battle. It's a joke weapon? Where's the comedy paragraph? That is, this is a knight's

210
00:29:48,809 --> 00:30:00,420
sword for a carrion knight. There's no joke paragraph. All right. I almost have enough.

211
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:29,099
Where is he? He's a great air. Where are you? Oh, hi. Hello. Hey, hey game. What the fuck was that?

212
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:49,859
Why can't I walk onto this guy? What the fuck? What? There's so many fucking trees in the goddamn

213
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,859
way. Somebody fucking rocks. Like I come down here so I can actually fight your dumb ass enemy.

214
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:27,140
Dude, stop turning around so fucking fast. I hate these things. These things just make me angry.

215
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,140
You know, you got that like one enemy in any of these souls games that just like makes you

216
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,579
remarkably fucking angry, remarkably angry. Like you, you can't stand being sitting in the seat

217
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:47,579
when you, when they show up is this guy. These, these, these big hands make me remarkably upset.

218
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:57,720
Like it's unbelievable how bad they make me. So let's see. What else did I not see over here?

219
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:07,289
I swear to God, I didn't even see it. All right. Just run. Like fuck, fuck this whole place. I

220
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:11,289
like, seriously, I don't care. They could literally be a sorcery item that kills every boss in one

221
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:16,009
hit literally over there. I don't even care. I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it.

222
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:40,890
I don't want it. I will do this though. I think it doesn't do that much damage. Oh, you bet your

223
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:56,490
ass. I'm going to sit here and do this. I need the souls. If he kills me, I'm going to be fucking

224
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:08,890
furious. How did you get in here? What? How did you get in here? Oh my God. I'm fucking mad. I

225
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,730
got to kill this guy because it's the only way that'll satiate my anger is killing this guy

226
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:35,240
right now. Holy shit. I'm going to cheese this shit out of this guy. I hate these fucking things.

227
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:45,109
I don't like, I don't like them, dude. I can't, it's just, I can't, I don't care. I'm leaving.

228
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,809
I'm leaving. He just moves too quickly. I don't care. Like I can run his head into the wall the

229
00:33:52,809 --> 00:34:00,539
whole time. What do I have? 13? I need 15. Those guys don't even get that much souls either.

230
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:08,599
There's such a pain in the ass that you can't, it's, give me the other spot. Like down here

231
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:20,179
or somewhere else. Yeah. I'm, I'm leaving the world's worst area. This guy's back too. All

232
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:28,070
right. 34 minutes in and then the mauled has started. Oh, just those hands. That's it. I

233
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,269
promise. I won't get mad for another 30 minutes as long as no fucking hands are involved.

234
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:47,880
I got to, I got to find somebody to kill. When there's somebody like right out here,

235
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,920
this is where like the lightning stuff was happening. No, no, I'm back. I'm back here at

236
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:08,630
the end place. All right. No more complaining. I'm killing these hands right now. Get down here. No,

237
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:18,420
get down here. Get down here. Go. Not two. I don't want to, not two, not two, not two. I would have

238
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:36,860
done one. Oh my God. I hate these motherfuckers so much. I don't even want to be here, but like my

239
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,300
body keeps gravitating back here. Cause I fucking hate this place so much. I want to wipe this whole

240
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:52,809
place out. The boys betrayed you and I, it took too long to cast. All right. I'm just getting my

241
00:35:52,809 --> 00:36:38,039
souls and leaving. I just need a few thousand. Get them right here. All right. Give me 2000 souls,

242
00:36:38,039 --> 00:37:07,420
please. Thank you. Oh shit. Now let's get the boys involved too. Why not? I can upgrade the boys

243
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:28,949
again, by the way. Look at how much better of an idea this was. This is so much smarter. Why would

244
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:37,030
I even, why would I torture myself with the stupid hand enemy when I could just go on a like exp trip?

245
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:53,530
Oh, I got a helmet. All right, gone a little bit more. That's it. One more.

246
00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:02,280
Everybody else die. I picked it to be you. All right. Goodbye. Thanks for the experience.

247
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:20,699
Appreciate it. All right. Let's go over there. They're chasing me. Okay. Well kill these guys.

248
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:32,730
What the fuck? He must have killed me in one hit. All right. Give me out. Let's go.

249
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,630
Okay. We're ready. We're good. Everything is fine. Everybody can relax.

250
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:49,860
Everything is good. Nothing is, there's no problem. Why are you getting zits at 42? Did you know that

251
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,739
it doesn't matter how old you are? You can still get pimples all the way through to your like 80.

252
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:13,880
Ooh, look what we can do now. I have a hundred mana. I have 100 mana. Oleg can actually show

253
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:25,719
up now. Okay. Let's give it a try. There's Oleg. I wonder how good Oleg is. It takes the entire

254
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:31,900
mana bar, by the way. Okay. Now I'm safe. I'm comfortable. I'm going to go up. Are you ready?

255
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Use the pouch for the summons. You know what? What a fucking brilliant person you really are.

256
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:46,150
Let's take this off here and let's get those. Where's the pouch? Like equipment pouch, right?

257
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:53,989
Is this it? Where is it? How do I get a pouch? Is there a way to do it? Does it have to be in

258
00:39:53,989 --> 00:40:05,239
the inventory? Which right? How do I do it? It's the first screen. How do I switch to the pouch?

259
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:16,519
Right side of the first screen. Oh shit. Okay. How do I assign something? Switch. Okay. I will go

260
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:27,900
right stick for Oleg, right D pad. We'll do left D pad for the boys and then down D pad for the

261
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,630
dogs. This is actually so much more useful. Why the hell did I not do this? Okay. So then I can

262
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:40,699
go like this. Yeah, that's much better. Cool. Thank you. I'm so glad that actually I haven't

263
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:44,460
streamed this in like three days. So you guys like know how to do like all like the actual quality

264
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:51,530
of life stuff that I didn't pay attention to because I know a shitload of you guys are at

265
00:40:51,530 --> 00:41:19,130
least like a full day ahead of me now. So I'm grateful. All right, let's do it. All right.

266
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:27,980
Oh, it's you. What do you have? Oh, again, we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna.

267
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:32,949
Last we met. Is it a lie? It pleaseth me to see torrent hail and hearty,

268
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,869
but tarnished. What business hast thou here? I have no memory of ink and thee in invitation.

269
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,659
No particular reason. No particular reason in particular thou claimest. Intrigued,

270
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:55,260
then mayhaps fate have steered thee to this reunion. Wilt thou enter into my service?

271
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,329
I am the witch, Ronnie. I stole death long ago. Then you say name was Rana? I search now for the

272
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:08,489
dark path. What's your name? That I might wonder. What's this person's name? And the world of all

273
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:18,809
that came before. Has that roused thy interest? Serve Ronnie the witch. I don't, um, I don't know

274
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:38,019
if I should do this. I don't know what this does. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I see. I did it. A choice

275
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:47,639
well made. Thou art a rare sword. Do I get witch sorceries? But I require as much of those under

276
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:53,239
my command. Why am I under your command? Good work from thee. I thought you were gonna,

277
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,289
I thought this was like I was gonna like do like a couple of little gigs for you. I didn't think I

278
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:06,949
was gonna be like under your command. Good. Then I ask we proceed with haste. There is in my service

279
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:14,820
a half-woven warrior by the name of Blythe. I would have thee join him in searching for

280
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:21,639
the hidden treasure of Nocron. The eternal treasure. I have called for Blythe to greet thee below.

281
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:27,400
What? Take from him the particulars. Wait, are we gonna like ride together somewhere? And there

282
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:36,179
will thou find E.G. or Canceller and Salavis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts also. Okay,

283
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:44,179
there's more people? Are we about to do like a, are we about to become like the wizard of Oz?

284
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:53,179
Are we gonna have like four people? Okay. Speak with the three who await below.

285
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:09,460
Okay, so they're just waiting for me below? I'm very interested. All right, let's go.

286
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:30,090
Are we gonna go kill the dragon together? I'm very interested right now. Is that them? Oh no,

287
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:44,860
that's just like a brass. Wait, who's this? What do you want? Is this the blacksmith?

288
00:44:52,380 --> 00:45:16,150
Okay. Okay, what's your guidance? Don't underestimate me.

289
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:39,000
What? Okay, let us give all that we can. Sure. All right, well, what are you gonna,

290
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:45,190
what kind of potions are you gonna give me? Where's the sack of jewels that just are gonna

291
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:51,690
help us on our journey? All right, so are they outside? Am I drinking? That is matcha.

292
00:45:52,489 --> 00:46:13,000
It's a green tea matcha powdered drink. Okay.

293
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:28,300
The well in the Mistwood. The well in the Mistwood. Let me write that down. Me.

294
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:57,980
I write that down? Okay. Well in the Mistwood. Okay. All right, well in the Mistwood for the

295
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:12,460
worgen guy. And then, wait, is that all you have to say? See if I can't. I won't, I won't,

296
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:21,380
I won't. Well, how can, well, how come, why are they force ghosts? I see. You must be Rani's new

297
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,059
I kind of like this person.

298
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,539
Celibus. I like this, I like this person.

299
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:50,949
I like this person. So where are you gonna be?

300
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,389
I reside in another tower.

301
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:04,500
Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Rani? If it were up to me,

302
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:11,940
I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you. But who am I to stand against the wishes of my lady?

303
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,500
Okay, very cool. Turn the sound up. Yeah, it looks like it was a little low. I got you.

304
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:28,949
I got you. Sound going up. I reside in another tower. Because I reside in another tower.

305
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,860
Do I have to pick one of these three that I want to play with?

306
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,769
Oh, you're in one, you're in this one or this one? Does it matter?

307
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:52,789
Where's the Mistwood? Mistwood. Where is that? Have I not found that yet? Where's Mistwood?

308
00:48:53,429 --> 00:49:09,059
It's east of Limgrave. Mistwood. Okay. He died, he did say Limgrave. But what about the guy with the

309
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:18,949
hat? What about the guy with the hat? This choice will have consequences. What? What about the big

310
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:24,010
guy? Did he even say where he was gonna be? Wait, I know where he is. Oh no, I have to pick one of

311
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:39,559
these three? So let me get- Okay, I've got a prediction. Oh no. There are no choices? Oh,

312
00:49:39,639 --> 00:49:43,900
there's not a choice. Okay. All right. All right. All right. So if that doesn't matter,

313
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,500
I was kind of concerned. So I'm going to go to that. But first, I'm going to go to the tower

314
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:54,949
where this guy is. You don't get to pick. It's okay. All right. All right. So I want to go to

315
00:49:54,949 --> 00:50:00,329
this tower. I think it's this one here. Unless it was the one that was closed before. But I'm going

316
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:11,900
to check this place out. That is so cool. I'm really excited. Because there's this one here.

317
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:25,880
Or choice matters. Well, all right. I'm gonna I'm literally gonna excuse me. What's going on here?

318
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:34,539
This is an invisible wall. That's odd. That shouldn't be here. I'm screwed up there. Go

319
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:46,300
talk to Ronnie first. Okay. Why can't I leave? It's because I can't. Why I can't leave the zone.

320
00:50:46,940 --> 00:51:00,099
I have to go talk to Ronnie or I can't leave. Okay. This seems pretty cool. I'm actually pretty

321
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:22,489
excited for this. We're off to see the wizard. The wonderful wizard of Oz. Here is a hell of a

322
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:30,570
I don't know the lyrics. Ah, allow me to forewarn thee. I shall soon enter my slumber.

323
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:36,889
And it will be some time before I wake. This doll's body is not without its hindrances.

324
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:44,969
Still, I have high hopes for thee. I look forward to the good news when I what are we what are we

325
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:51,340
doing? I don't even know what the quest is. I shall soon enter and it will be what's what's the

326
00:51:51,340 --> 00:52:08,760
quest? I hope I look for all she said is I'm gonna go to sleep. You're off to sell the treasure.

327
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,079
Right, right, right, right, right. All right. Here we go. It's time. We're gonna go explore.

328
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:22,550
I want to go see what is the deal. I want to see what the deal is at the tower because I want to

329
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,739
talk to they're all gone. But you know what I mean? Not fighting that dragon right now. We got

330
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:34,539
we got way bigger fish to fry. It's not a huge dragon. No, not even cool. Not even remotely

331
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:57,099
interesting. Let's go. Oh my god. I think I'm fine. I'm too excited. Fuck. We're off to see

332
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:22,119
the wizard. The wonderful wizard. What do we do now? I don't know. I'm not sure what we do now.

333
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:27,800
What do we do? What do we do? Okay. That it's hard to do that without the cringe. It is that the

334
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:34,329
lion is hard to do without absolute cringe. Do you understand how hard that is to do? Like it like

335
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:41,449
without everybody being like stop. Put a mob. Put a mob. What are you doing? Nobody can do that

336
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:45,929
without it. It has to be that bad actor like nobody else can. It's kind of like anybody

337
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:58,550
else doing that is cringing. You're the lion. No, I am not the lion. No, I would not be the lion.

338
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:04,889
And I would not be the mayor of munchkin land. Okay, so let's get that out of the way. I would

339
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:20,119
be the scarecrow. Get the fuck away from me. I would be the scarecrow. You know how I know

340
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:23,960
I'd be the scarecrow because the scarecrow does like little movements. He like goes like this and

341
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,159
like this and he like puts his hands like this and shit like that's me. That's me. I'm the scarecrow.

342
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:36,780
All right, there's this person. So here we go.

343
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:54,840
Cease to amaze. Okay. I suppose you're here now. Perhaps I'll give you something to do.

344
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,320
What do you do? I'd like you to find a woman called Nefeli to administer a potion.

345
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:06,440
Even you can do that much. Where are they? What do I do? I do it. I'll do it.

346
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:21,510
Okay, syllabus is potion. Find Nefeli and ensure she drinks it. Find Nefeli. I expect clad tidings

347
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:30,440
and soon. I have no time for idle shit. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your

348
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:39,500
tasks completion. Are we understood? I have enough on it please. Oh, do you know what? Where are they?

349
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,039
I have no time. The only thing I have is I have enough. Does it say on the thing?

350
00:55:45,000 --> 00:56:05,880
Where is it? What if I just like drink it in front of him? Where is it? It looks like a key item.

351
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,800
Oh, there it is. Small flask received from Perceptor Celvis containing a cloudy tonic

352
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:21,909
of bluish black. Find Nefeli and ensure she drinks it. I don't know where that person is.

353
00:56:22,469 --> 00:56:45,960
I need to put it on my notepad. Okay. Sure. Maybe. But what if I don't? All right.

354
00:56:46,760 --> 00:57:06,360
I don't confuse me. I'll just. It's the potion quest. Okay. Sounds good. What if it's poison?

355
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,039
I mean, it probably is poison and I'm gonna have to make a decision whether or not I want to keep

356
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:20,170
that person alive or not. All right. What if I just give him the potion? If I'm like, here,

357
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:34,539
how about a nice ice cold spray? Oh, thank you. Of course. And then I'll get his hat.

358
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:48,340
Ooh, good. Very good. Very good. Very good. Another spell slot. So what about,

359
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:55,659
can I go back in here though? Because now it's like, okay, maybe not. I could try. All right.

360
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:13,820
Mist. Where the mist is. The well in the mist would. Check it out. You wouldn't download a car.

361
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:22,340
No, I, you're right. I wouldn't. If I was a well, I would probably be like here somewhere.

362
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:31,400
There's a, that's a well. That is a well. Is it just, okay, down, is it just in Siofra?

363
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:50,550
Okay. How do I switch map to go down to? Okay. Let's do it. I need to like switch. Oh,

364
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:57,820
shit. All right. So where, where is he going to be? Just, I'll be down the well.

365
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:06,840
Just right in the front, front door. I'll be down the well. You'll find me by the well.

366
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:28,500
Right. Something like that. I don't think he's here. Riverbank. Maybe this is how to get here

367
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:38,230
with this, uh, with this fest this way. How can we read the most out of context messages?

368
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:46,980
We're just looking for him. He's going to be sitting somewhere in a weird spot.

369
00:59:47,860 --> 01:00:15,820
His arms crossed. Just like sitting there. Frames. There he is. Frames. Right there. All right. I

370
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:27,539
found him. There you are. All right. Cool. He's really intimidating. Do you fight these guys?

371
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,260
What do you have to say about these guys that shoot the bow and arrows from across the whole

372
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,579
game? I mean, you, you could probably just kill them and you're going to kill them. Can I give,

373
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:42,619
will he die? All right. Fight them. Show me what you can do. Very intimidating. That's right. See

374
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:47,670
who I'm with. I'm with the guy that you don't want to fuck with and we're together and we're

375
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,280
coming to, we're, we're coming to the party together. Yeah. And that, and that's something.

376
01:00:53,159 --> 01:01:07,349
And that's something. Yeah. Hey, I got this. Don't get up. Good to see you. Apologies, mate,

377
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:19,099
but I don't. I thought he killed me. I thought it was like a fucking scam. I thought it was a scam.

378
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:24,460
Like apologies. Like, sorry, mate. Like, boom, like arrow in the neck.

379
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:38,340
I missed that whole fucking thing. I just hear, oh, apologies, mate. Nothing to report so far. Boom.

380
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,639
Out. I fucking swear to God, I'm going to throw this guy. I'm going to just grab him by his legs

381
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:51,619
and just spin, spin, spin and throw him into a fucking bomb. I am trying to immerse myself

382
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:58,280
in the world. Leave me alone. And I don't care about your world immersion. I don't care about

383
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:03,079
your story arc. I care about that story arc of the big hairy guy. I don't give a shit about your

384
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:18,889
story. Can you repeat that whole thing? Because I missed everything. Damn it. Is he still going to

385
01:02:18,889 --> 01:02:24,010
be there? Is he going to be there? Right? Is he still going to be there? He's still going to be

386
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:38,179
on the ledge. What if he's gone? It's because when you get on the horse, you move forward like,

387
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:48,739
okay, thank God you're still there. Please leave me alone. I don't want to aggro anything.

388
01:02:49,380 --> 01:03:05,510
I already did, but whatever. Like I'll just kill them. Are you going to shoot an arrow from all

389
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:11,320
the way down there? You better not. Okay. He's shooting the arrow into a rocket. Just can we

390
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:31,369
walk this way? All right. I'll show you what I got. You're working with a saucer. Impressive.

391
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,769
Was that Loretta's grade bomb? I haven't seen that move in at least three or four years.

392
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:47,699
How did you come across such an incredible item? Well, well. I jest that far. Besides,

393
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:54,900
I should check on some things here. Leave this place to me. You just do what you feel is right.

394
01:03:55,539 --> 01:04:03,960
If either of us learns anything, we tell the other. Right. What was the first thing you told me?

395
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,420
Leave this place to me. And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.

396
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,539
Some of us rarely gives a straight answer the first time.

397
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:28,309
God damn it. I keep thinking you're betraying me. I swear to God. Stop. Okay. What was the first

398
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:34,230
thing he said? I was freaking out. He was like, let's go up there and beat that person up. He

399
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:42,380
mentioned about us beating somebody up. Where did what did he say? He's like, oh, we go beat

400
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:52,949
that person up. He said to go talk. He meant syllabus. He said you go talk to syllabus. Okay.

401
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:02,150
Okay. All right. Okay. Damn it, man. Go talk to the sorcerer. Come back.

402
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:08,809
I have a potion from the sorcerer. Squeeze the sorcerer, right?

403
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:29,139
All right. We have new dialogue with syllabus. The syllabus is this one down here. This is cool.

404
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:54,019
Oh, mind the dragon. Hey, what info do you have?

405
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:59,380
Time for idle chit chat. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your tasks completion.

406
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:08,039
Are we understood? I haven't. You're asking me about that. Are you? The task was left to you and

407
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:14,920
the mongrel, was it not? Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. Dead if you keep going here,

408
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:21,559
bud. Now's as good a time as any. I let you in on it. What's going on? A glint stone sorcerer by the

409
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:28,199
name of selling in the grave. She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from

410
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:33,800
the academy. Who's that? I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. I'll write you a letter

411
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:41,739
of introduction. Go ask. Is that the lady that I found in syllabus introduction? Okay. No time for

412
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:47,000
the only thing. Are we? And I haven't. Is that the lady, the burger queen? Yep. Okay. I gotta

413
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:57,579
remember where that was. Burger queen was where? Somewhere in one of these caves. Waypoint ruins?

414
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:03,500
It was really, really close to the start of the game. I think it's this one here. Waypoint ruins.

415
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:15,690
Am I still dropping frames? What the fuck? It's annoying. It shouldn't be doing that. Let me see.

416
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:37,719
It should even out. Why is it doing this? Yeah, I mean, I'm dropping frames on OBS,

417
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,789
but my internet connection's fine. I don't know. Maybe it's like my connection to the

418
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:51,219
um, it might be my connection to this, to Twitch servers. So because everything else seems perfectly

419
01:07:51,219 --> 01:07:58,250
fine. It happens like every five to 10 minutes. Hmm. All right. Well, here we go. There you are,

420
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:06,789
my apprentice. Shall we commence the lesson? Son of us is not a name I ever wanted to hear again,

421
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:14,619
but fine. If it will help you, my apprentice, I offer my knowledge. Thank you. The stars alter

422
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:21,270
the fate of the Karyan royal family and the fate of your mistress Rani. Long ago,

423
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:28,329
General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations and in a crushing victory arrested their cycles.

424
01:08:28,329 --> 01:08:35,210
Huh? Now he is the force that repulses the stars. If General Radahn were to die, the stars would

425
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:43,340
resume their movement and so too would Rani's destiny. Okay. Um, I'm going to hand you a piece

426
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,819
of paper and can you just write down a name and an X on where they are and then how,

427
01:08:48,699 --> 01:09:02,680
you know what I mean? Like I don't, what does that mean? Ooh. All right. Ooh. Ooh.

428
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:16,069
That's new. Okay. So now we take that. We take that back to the source server guy or do I go

429
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:30,810
back to the wolf now? I think the wolf at this point. Yeah. Very cool. All right. So now we're

430
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:49,079
going to go talk to the wolf. You were here. This is crazy. Pepe laugh. Haha. Pepe laugh. All right.

431
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:54,470
Well, that's not good. He's the best boss in the game. New spell slot. You're exactly right,

432
01:09:54,470 --> 01:10:29,930
but I can do it left here. What news? Oh shit. Don't kill him. I need him. I was seeing if he

433
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:36,489
would get angry. What if he just got hit in the head and died? Oh my God. That would be horrible.

434
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:41,369
I'm freaking out right now. Oh my fucking God. All right. I thought I actually fucked everything

435
01:10:41,369 --> 01:10:47,369
up. I thought, I honestly thought I fucked up the whole game and I thought he was going to get

436
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:57,220
aggroed and like break his quest. Is this your first time playing? No, no. I beat every souls

437
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:01,220
game. I beat Sekiro on stream. Final boss in Sekiro, which is one of the hardest things I've

438
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:17,579
ever done. So don't worry. I'll get it eventually. He's still bragging about Sekiro. Yeah. I will

439
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:22,060
take that to the grave because I know people that abandoned, I know a shitload of people abandoned

440
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:28,060
Sekiro at the last like hour of the other game. I didn't. I beat it. I beat the last fucking guy.

441
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:31,180
And I know a bunch of people like, yeah, fuck that game. I'm not ever playing that ever again.

442
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:53,020
And I was like, yeah. And then I beat him. Do you guys have to seriously have an aggro range

443
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:02,579
that's this far? Just get out of here. Okay. We're good. What news? Here's the story. So Rani's

444
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:08,500
fate is kept in stasis by Starsgur's Radar. That reminds me of something I heard. What did you hear?

445
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,659
There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Kaelid Wiles,

446
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:19,529
east of Limgrave. It's a festival of combat. And I heard that you can fight Radar himself.

447
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:26,199
He who's once called the strongest of all the Debbie gods. Maybe it's just a coincidence.

448
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,250
I think it's worth investigating. I'll be on my way to this festival of Radar.

449
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:39,539
Okay. In big F. I know. You're coming too, right? I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in

450
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:45,430
Kaelid. Redmane Castle in Kaelid. We fight sword and fire.

451
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,710
You understand like, why did this guy all do this? Why did he, he was de-aggroed.

452
01:12:51,829 --> 01:13:08,939
These guys weren't even, it's been like, oh two minutes. Just get, you are way too level for

453
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:24,279
Radan. Oh, I still, Kaelid's all over there. I beat Radan. Okay. Well, at least I want to check,

454
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:34,500
maybe I'll check it out. Okay. So that is here. Probably up here somewhere. I haven't been over

455
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:44,420
here really at all. So I don't know. Maybe I, okay. I have that activated now. Maybe I continue to

456
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:50,659
trek this way. Cause there's still stuff apparently up here that I haven't done. Is it, it's visible

457
01:13:50,659 --> 01:14:02,710
up on the map. Is it, it's not this over here. It's like the festival. Is it here? No, it's

458
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:10,630
probably there. I've been stuck on Radan for four days. Oh God, that's not encouraging.

459
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:37,350
That's it? Wait, it is this. It's this? Okay. What does this do? Where does this go?

460
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:58,140
Probably across the great bridge, right? I still, I'm just seeing what's here. It said impassable

461
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:08,069
bridge, but it's, it's, I can walk across it. I don't know what they mean. Why does it say that?

462
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:38,119
Is that going to take me just right to the, oh, I'm just here now. There's a tournament or

463
01:15:38,119 --> 01:16:06,550
something going on. It's definitely right there in the halo theme song. Okay. Well I got this.

464
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:12,649
I kind of want to check out what's going on back there though. This festival. Yeah. Should I do

465
01:16:12,649 --> 01:16:16,409
that? I kind of don't want to like have the frame rate. I don't want it like the internet to fuck

466
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,890
up in the middle of one of these fights, right? Cause then how am I supposed to prove if I beat

467
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:30,760
it? I'm kind of scared. Maybe I'll come back later. Is it actually a tournament arc?

468
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:40,399
What?

469
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:52,899
It's actually a tournament? This is insane. Do you, how many bosses do you fight?

470
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,600
Grab the great run.

471
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:21,850
Defeat the general in glory and great

472
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:32,970
and feel real bad for her. I've been practicing this new move to Loretta's great bow for anybody

473
01:17:32,970 --> 01:17:37,369
that, you know, just in case somebody thought they were going to be at least even think they

474
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:44,619
could compete against me. And I mean, you know, I beat Loretta, killed Loretta mere hours ago,

475
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:47,899
got some pretty cool moves. You know, there's still time to back out of the tournament.

476
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:50,170
Fucking loser.

477
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:01,050
Fist of Alexander.

478
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:08,939
This is the pot.

479
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:32,439
Be sure to get a good vantage.

480
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,079
Look at that guy.

481
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:53,829
Oh, y'all should just go home. Okay. Who's that? Wait, what else do I have to say? This is crazy.

482
01:18:53,829 --> 01:19:13,319
I like this. Get a good vantage. Okay. What about you? Do that. What do you have to say?

483
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:22,680
Then what's going on with your hand here? All right. All right. We've got to go through all these

484
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:29,289
clowns into the fray together. Let's see what you made into the fray together. So wait, is it,

485
01:19:29,289 --> 01:19:35,289
it's like a tag team matches. Is it two V two? This is cool. Okay. I can't wait. This is actually

486
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:49,079
awesome. We're going to get two V twos into the fray together. Let's go. The prepared young chum,

487
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:58,149
the festival begin. Let's do it. I'm going to get my ass kicked. Wow. We begin.

488
01:19:58,949 --> 01:20:21,460
Allow me to paint you the full picture. What? Long time ago. General Radon is cursed ever to wonder

489
01:20:24,949 --> 01:20:32,500
inside by millennia scarlet rot. His wits are long gone.

490
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:47,300
Oh, now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike, gorging on them like a dog

491
01:20:51,369 --> 01:21:09,340
at the sky. But now we must make merry. Oh, gathering of champions. The rebels begin

492
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,539
the celebration of war.

493
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:21,819
I just started killing this guy next to me. Art and cry. Do I have to start fighting him?

494
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:24,859
Do I just start, do I backstab this guy? Is it everywhere for himself?

495
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:34,340
Past the church ahead on the shore. It's time to battle.

496
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:48,010
And howling at the sky. Okay. So he's through here. Oh, okay. So I get it. But wait, is there

497
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:54,899
anything else I can see? It might be something I can pick up. You guys are all on the same team.

498
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:59,779
What if I had backstabbed him? What would happen? Would I have just ruined this quest line?

499
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:09,579
Thank God I can actually upgrade this weapon now. It's been like six plus hours in game time.

500
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:23,270
Let me just check what's going on here. I don't want to just run out there,

501
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:39,689
but something in here. Anything? Yeah, there is smithing stone six. Nice. I don't think I've seen

502
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:55,029
one of those yet. What does this go? I was just trying to see what this does. Curious. Let's go

503
01:22:55,029 --> 01:23:13,180
down road. Yeah. I'm going to upgrade my weapon. It goes down here. Okay. What is this?

504
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:19,510
Okay. Did I just like find something else? It's like a summoning thing here. There's definitely

505
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:45,130
a boss right here. I just like wandered away. Can I walk in this? I'm curious. What does this go?

506
01:23:49,989 --> 01:23:56,579
Wait, I thought what happened to the tournament? I thought we were in a tournament. Star Scourge

507
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:10,789
for Dan. I thought we were in tournament together. What's all this shit? All right. I

508
01:24:10,789 --> 01:24:19,340
got to get the timing down on this. I'm like confused. It's like travel so fast, but so slow

509
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:37,529
at the same time. Okay. Just don't drink. What is this shit on the ground? Oh shit. Let's go.

510
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:46,899
Wait, I can just bring everybody in here? I don't give a shit about the emote I just unlocked.

511
01:24:47,619 --> 01:25:04,819
I don't care. Like put it in the fucking top left of the screen. You don't need to teach me

512
01:25:04,819 --> 01:25:09,140
your dance move. Like when I press the button to... All right. I'm going to upgrade this shit.

513
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:18,630
Do I have enough to... I don't have enough souls to do it. I could probably sell some stuff. Yeah,

514
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:37,239
I will. Let me upgrade my weapon. That should be fun. Okay. If I summon each person and they

515
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:39,880
teach me a dance move, is that going to be annoying? Am I going to have to like hit,

516
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,439
like get it off the screen? Is that going to be annoying?

517
01:25:42,840 --> 01:26:05,529
There you go. So let me get rid of some of this stuff. I know for a fact I'm not going to use...

518
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:24,409
I don't want to sell it though. I want this stuff. Okay. I have two of these. I don't want these

519
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:37,590
bug helmets. I'm not going to use them. I don't want to sell any of this. I need to sell something.

520
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:57,020
I'm going to sell some materials. Yeah. Oh, okay. Sell these. I don't need these. I need 800. Yeah.

521
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:07,159
Use this FP. Throw magic darts. What am I going to use those for? Okay. Here we go. This will get

522
01:27:07,159 --> 01:27:14,949
this to plus five, which is way better than what it is right now. I need a somber smithing stone

523
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:30,789
six. All right. That looks good. Sick. Sick. Sick. Let me... I want to do like the actual tournament.

524
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:44,789
I don't want to just wander off to the beach and get killed. Look at me. He's purple.

525
01:27:44,789 --> 01:27:56,859
I'm just... I don't know. Sometimes I turn purple. All right. Let's try it. All right. If I can't do

526
01:27:56,859 --> 01:28:07,880
this... If I don't... If I'm not reliably going... Oh, I got this. That is the tournament. Oh,

527
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:15,960
what was this thing here with the... All right. Spell slot. I'm not going to use it against him.

528
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:21,319
I'm not going to use it for the boss anyways. It's okay. All right. I'm ready.

529
01:28:26,069 --> 01:28:32,220
I'm ready. Do I have to do this every time? Is he going to have to tell me the story every time?

530
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:43,270
We don't. Okay. So I can... So what happens if I go through this? Does this just take you to that

531
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:53,260
area? What is like through this door? Or is this just blocked? Okay. So that's just blocked. Okay.

532
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:59,060
I don't know if you get to go through it or something. All right. Let's go. I'm going to

533
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:04,340
try it. I got to get that timing down. We... I got to... I got to dodge, summon, dodge, summon,

534
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:19,720
dodge, summon. Oh, right. Because there was that statue. You're right. Okay. What's this?

535
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:41,210
Anything here? All right. Let's go. Let's give it a try. The statue will be right here. All right.

536
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:55,960
Gaming begins. I don't think I'm going to use mana that much. We'll see. I really don't know.

537
01:29:57,109 --> 01:30:08,170
But let's try it. Okay. It's time to fight this guy. All right. Dodge, summon, dodge,

538
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:54,779
summon. Let's go. Everybody. Everyone. There's more people? Oh, the jar. Oh, shit. Get in there.

539
01:31:00,119 --> 01:31:08,840
All right. Get him. Get him. Get him. Summon Patches? Wait. Patches is here? Everybody's here.

540
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:22,659
Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in. Everybody get in. Oh, let me get the item. All right. Patches. Go.

541
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:42,949
It's like skin hanging off my mouth. Wait. Blade is dead. Why did Patches leave? Let's go.

542
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:07,239
Oh, shit. Everybody's dead. What is he? He's on a horse? He's on a horse. What the fuck?

543
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:46,779
Are you shitting me? That poor horse. Oh, nice. All right. Let's go. Oh, what the fuck?

544
01:32:48,600 --> 01:33:03,189
I think that's a gravity move. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. I have no stamina. Did he drain my

545
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:23,100
stamina? Holy shit. Okay. You got to jump over that. I thought he was on wheels.

546
01:33:30,729 --> 01:34:16,100
Burning through stamina here. I wonder why. Damn it, man. Oh, shit. I'm dead. It's over.

547
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:29,239
You can resummon people? Resummon in phase two? I was just eating through stamina unlike before.

548
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:49,819
I was just inhaling stamina. You can resummon indefinitely. I wonder if I should put more

549
01:34:49,819 --> 01:34:58,710
mana on and just shoot him with a bow. He's stamina drains. Oh, that's what it is.

550
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:07,300
Can I just run through? How hard is it to dodge this on the horse? Okay. I'm fucking just roving

551
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:18,149
into it. Hold on a second. Let me get this down. Can I just go like this? Let me see. Hold on.

552
01:35:18,949 --> 01:35:30,489
Yeah. Okay. I was testing to see if you could just run parallel to it. You cannot. Just kill me

553
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:37,460
because there's no reason to do this right now. I was seeing if you could just run like parallel,

554
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:40,899
all right? Perpendicular and not get hit by it, but he hits you with it no matter what.

555
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:49,430
Whatever. Say it. You know what I mean? The triangulation. Yeah. The sword ruins break one

556
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:58,039
hit. I think I got it. I think I got this. It's going to come down to just kind of running around

557
01:35:58,039 --> 01:36:17,699
and being patient. Try Oleg. I got to be up a little closer, I think. Here we go. You, you,

558
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:46,500
you, you, you, you. Go, go, go, go, go. What the fuck are they doing? Why are they spinning around?

559
01:36:47,539 --> 01:37:03,000
All right. Let's go. What happened? Hello? What happened? What happened? What's going on?

560
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:20,220
Where's my horse? What the fuck? Why did I die? What was that? Oh shit. That was dumb.

561
01:37:20,939 --> 01:37:46,840
Was I falling? Oh shit. Okay. Well, whatever. All right. Get him again. So when you're saying

562
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:57,289
that when he, when the summons die, I can go. Jesus. So I can just run back and summon them all

563
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:26,390
again. I mean, that's, that's what we're doing. No. Everybody in. Everybody. Get on it. Get on.

564
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:38,140
Oh my God. I'm just like fucking spam. So those, those, those things follow you around.

565
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:43,100
Of course they do. So can I summon them on the horse? I wonder if I can just dodge that shit

566
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:57,609
and just run. See you guys in four days. No, no, no, no way. He has homing. I think I can,

567
01:38:57,609 --> 01:39:03,100
I could try to avoid it. It's like getting off the horse and having that like one and a half seconds

568
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:07,739
of animation that you can't do anything with is what will get me killed if I get off the horse.

569
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:16,170
Let me see what happens if I do this. Like, can I, I'm just seeing if I can like dash like

570
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:27,350
right when it's there, right? We do it. It's a test run. That's run. So you physically cannot

571
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:34,170
avoid getting hit by that. Let's maybe jump over it. See, I didn't try dashing when it was right

572
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:46,869
there. I tried running. I'm going to try jumping. Let's try jumping. Yeah. That's a test run. Yeah.

573
01:39:46,869 --> 01:39:49,909
I know I can use the scrap piles to block it. That's not what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned

574
01:39:49,909 --> 01:39:54,149
about like needing to go all the fucking way over there. And when he does that stupid arrow homing

575
01:39:54,149 --> 01:40:04,600
missile boom, let me see that happen. That ain't fucking happening. The dude literally has a homing

576
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:09,479
missile. It's like a 5,000 mile per hour homing missile. You can't do it. I just have to do what

577
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:39,350
I did before. Really? No shit. What happened? What? What? He, I got hit by like the spray.

578
01:40:40,149 --> 01:40:50,420
Just run sideways. It, it, it still hits you. Even if you run sideways, you have to get lucky.

579
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:56,359
You're a bigger target on the horse. All right. So the play is to just run backwards and just let

580
01:40:56,359 --> 01:41:04,170
them all run in. You have iframes while you summon the horse. How many though?

581
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:17,210
Hold on. Let's find out. Interesting. All right. Well, you don't have, you don't have iframes when

582
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:24,729
you get off the horse. How long do they last? Is it the whole time? It's actually really interesting.

583
01:41:24,729 --> 01:41:30,539
Okay. No, you don't. Okay. You only have iframes when you get on the horse, not off.

584
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:36,779
I think I'm just going to have to do what I did last time. And that's just, I had just get on,

585
01:41:36,779 --> 01:42:18,039
just do it on point. Let's do the stuff I think about. Oh, he's coming for me. All right. So you

586
01:42:18,039 --> 01:42:49,340
said I can re-summon them now, but not yet. Spot's still alive. Okay. Oh, he's staggered,

587
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:55,239
but it's not going to help me. Don't do it. Okay. Here we go. So wait, I can summon them again.

588
01:42:56,279 --> 01:43:21,670
I don't think I can. Nobody's there yet. I got to figure out like what a good time to go is.

589
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:29,960
Spot's still alive. Shit. I don't, I still don't know when to go.

590
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:41,750
Me, man. When I go in there, he just doesn't move. Are they not in the same place? I don't see any

591
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:56,630
summoning signs. Just have to be really careful and slow. This is one of those like 15 minute

592
01:43:56,630 --> 01:44:02,649
boss encounters. I need to get to phase two. Okay. They come back for phase two. Okay.

593
01:44:02,649 --> 01:44:23,960
Let's keep going with what I was doing. Like, please suck my ass.

594
01:44:26,279 --> 01:45:56,420
You, you're not, what the fuck are you doing? Oh my God. Fuck off already. Good. Oh, fuck you.

595
01:45:56,420 --> 01:46:02,659
Are you kidding me? Oh my God. What a hero. What a fucking hero. Who did that?

596
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:17,319
Who did that? I don't know who did that. Yes, should be the one on the right, not the left.

597
01:46:17,319 --> 01:46:22,039
I shouldn't have to press left on the D pad. Of course I want to re-summon. Of course I want to

598
01:46:22,039 --> 01:46:30,859
summon the fucking whores. What happened? There's meteors falling. Are we back? What's going on?

599
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:54,409
Where is he? Okay. There he is. Holy shit. Okay. I, what do those do? What do those things do?

600
01:46:54,409 --> 01:47:05,210
What do the meatballs do? Do the meatballs fly out? What do the meatballs do? I don't, what do

601
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:33,369
the meatballs do? Bro, I don't fucking know. Are they going to shoot at me? Are you, are you fucking

602
01:47:33,369 --> 01:47:45,619
kidding me? But they have a countdown timer of like two straight minutes. What? I'm sitting there

603
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:56,729
waiting for them to do anything and they just fucking sit there. Okay. Here's my play. Here's

604
01:47:56,729 --> 01:48:16,810
the play. Uh, I'm going to put more mana potions in. Let's go. We're doing arrows. I don't want

605
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:21,590
to fight this guy normally. This is a very abnormal fight. This is a very weird fight.

606
01:48:25,609 --> 01:48:28,810
I'm going to get on top of my horse and I'm going to fucking, I'm going to, I'm going to

607
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:40,409
meatball this guy. Cheese Andy. That's right. It's going to be a toasted fucking cheese sandwich

608
01:48:40,409 --> 01:48:58,739
with a side of tomato soup. Before we begin, but now we, let's do it. It's time for some grade A

609
01:48:58,739 --> 01:49:08,220
cheese. I cheese so hard. I didn't even have to hit him myself. I, you know, I really feel,

610
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:17,220
I really feel bad for the like 60 points in strength. Andy's was like, how the fuck do you

611
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:22,659
do this fight? This is probably so hard because you have to just get up in there and you've got

612
01:49:22,659 --> 01:49:30,630
to get up in there. Oh man. I just spam summons and got the last hit to make myself feel better.

613
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:40,199
It's easy on strength. You just have to do a test. I wonder how much damage it does.

614
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:50,060
Do 600 damage per hit. Oh, that's like, that's good. All right. Should I bring out Oleg too?

615
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:53,420
I feel like that's too much mana. This is not the time. This is not the time for Oleg.

616
01:49:54,060 --> 01:50:33,130
All right, here we go. Bullshit. Bullshit again. I, what? He didn't do that before.

617
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:42,359
What a dick. Oh my fucking God. I hate this fucking guy. He usually does the,

618
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:59,880
he does the fucking frame drop. The fuck? No, I don't want to like run like across the whole

619
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:05,720
game to fight the guy, to do a deal with his like trap shooting. Like, oh look, he's got like the

620
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:09,640
orcs must die trap that he shoots at you. I don't, I want to fight the guy.

621
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:51,130
Stop. What the fuck? All right. Get in there. Get in there. What are you waiting for?

622
01:51:52,329 --> 01:51:58,409
Get in there and fight him. You guys are pissing me off. You guys are pissing me off. You're pissing

623
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:04,569
me off. Get in there. I'm a fucking raid leader. Yeah. Like what taking so long? Fucking get up

624
01:52:04,569 --> 01:53:08,149
there and fight him. Get out the maiden. What are you doing? Get away from me. Go fight him.

625
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:32,489
He's literally in front of you. Where'd he go? Is he underground? Oh shit. No, dude. I'm so confused.

626
01:53:32,489 --> 01:53:40,100
What is this person? I thought he was going to phase two. I don't, I'm so confused. I thought

627
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:48,760
he like went like away. He's a healer. I'm so fucking confused. I, oh my God. Okay. I'll get

628
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:56,949
him now. I'm going to get him. I'll get him. I'll get him now. Don't worry. Stupid ass encounter.

629
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:17,659
Watch the, I watched the clip after this. You guys, honestly, God, like I'm about to fucking scream.

630
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:31,109
Like just kill me already so I can start it again. I fucking, I fucking hate the fact that he's just

631
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:35,430
playing orcs must die. Like this is dark souls. Okay. This is an orc. I don't want to be an orc

632
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:39,270
and orcs must die. I just want to fucking go get them. I want to fight them. I want to fight this

633
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:45,510
guy. I don't want to, I don't want to get hit by like the spring trap. Like, oh, look out, watch out

634
01:54:46,149 --> 01:55:07,449
the spikes that come out on the wall. I feel like he's playing tower defense and I'm like one of the

635
01:55:07,449 --> 01:55:25,699
little shits. He didn't fucking do it. He usually does. You know what I'm saying. You know what I'm

636
01:55:25,699 --> 01:55:43,210
fucking saying. And now I'm fucked. Fucking summon them. What the fuck? God, I hate this.

637
01:55:44,010 --> 01:56:01,210
I like just summon them. Like I'm just running over them. Oh, I'm so mad right now. I didn't even

638
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:11,779
hit him. This is the guy that was in the E3 trailer. This is what you're going to do?

639
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:34,619
No, no, don't fight the fucking raid leader. Fight those, fight the other guys, fight the other people.

640
01:56:35,420 --> 01:57:06,460
Ow. Oh shit. I just got really, really sloppy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

641
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:22,899
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't be an idiot. God damn it. I'm not locked on. I don't even know

642
01:57:22,899 --> 01:57:50,500
who the fuck he is. This is fucking, this is dumb. Okay. What do you want me to do?

643
01:57:51,460 --> 01:58:17,220
Look at the clip. What's the clip? Let me get it. This is fucking dumb. I hate this. All right, let's go

644
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:21,039
I'm so I hate this. All right. What are we watching? Let's go

645
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:38,229
I don't want to fight this guy. I want to fucking just leave

646
01:58:44,189 --> 01:58:51,779
Fuckin hate this guy. I want all right. I'm beating him right now. I'm fine. So bad. It's unvoking believable

647
01:58:53,449 --> 01:59:03,180
All right

648
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:05,659
That didn't even look real that looked like a fake picture

649
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:09,659
That looked like I put I pumped that in on purpose. I fuck all right

650
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:17,449
Stop shut up. Fuck you. I'm gonna beat him right now. This is the one I promised

651
01:59:18,090 --> 01:59:26,140
All right, he did the stupid orcs must die move and now I gotta get on the

652
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:45,180
Hurry, hurry, hurry

653
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:47,340
No, dude, get on the fucking horse

654
01:59:50,569 --> 01:59:54,329
Why are you still shooting at me? There are people in front of you. Do you not see?

655
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:32,680
Get in there, please

656
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:56,090
All right, let's go. I'm gonna summon some more people

657
02:01:56,649 --> 02:02:02,220
There's a stone. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god

658
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:04,460
I thought he was back. I thought he was turned to face the other guy

659
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:12,630
I thought he was turning the other way because the guy was in front of him. I hate this encounter

660
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:15,979
Oh my god, I hate it

661
02:02:15,979 --> 02:02:21,029
This is not even about dodging the guy

662
02:02:21,189 --> 02:02:25,189
it's just throw up a bunch of fucking action figures to like this like

663
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:28,069
The school bully that comes and stomps on him

664
02:02:34,539 --> 02:02:37,500
Oh my how do I throw a grenade down at the ground and die?

665
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:49,979
Just throw a grenade to the ground like because i'm like I just wasted a estus

666
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:10,899
Even with sorcery too. You were here very early. You can do the fun stuff

667
02:03:11,619 --> 02:03:14,420
I'm beating this guy out of spite. I'm gonna win

668
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:18,840
This guy is such a piece of shit

669
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,640
I'm going to beat him out of spite

670
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:30,300
All right

671
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:37,720
If in 10 tries I do not do it. I'm going to leave and we'll come back later

672
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:48,380
10 tries 10 tries

673
02:04:24,569 --> 02:04:26,569
Fuck you. Where are they?

674
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:29,420
Oh my god eat

675
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:33,020
Eat it seriously. God fucking damn it. Like I just don't

676
02:04:35,300 --> 02:05:17,720
Like I fucking hate it

677
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:22,680
Oh my god, the fucking turning radius on this stupid ass horse. Like give me a fucking goddamn break

678
02:05:40,119 --> 02:05:42,199
If you if you were on the ground, how would you avoid that?

679
02:06:03,449 --> 02:06:07,800
dude like

680
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:30,170
Help me help my god. How the fuck are you dodging the house?

681
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:20,390
Dead I can't get out of this. I can't animation cancel anything. I'm stuck. How are you still alive lady?

682
02:07:20,789 --> 02:07:36,600
Is lady still alive?

683
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:38,600
She's just running behind him

684
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,199
What the fuck?

685
02:07:40,199 --> 02:07:58,600
All right. I got some of these guys

686
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:01,880
I can't take my thing off of them. I gotta like get it like here

687
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:12,340
Come on lionel get over here. All right, there's another couple that respawned over here

688
02:08:15,779 --> 02:08:17,659
Christ

689
02:08:17,659 --> 02:08:20,619
Where are they? I can't take the lock on off of them. I gotta just run around

690
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:36,470
It's like right here somewhere. All right, turn around and fight

691
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:01,909
All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's fight fight fight fight fight. I need more summons

692
02:09:01,909 --> 02:09:08,760
Where are they everybody back?

693
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,920
Fucking horse what?

694
02:09:11,239 --> 02:09:13,239
Huh? What happened? What?

695
02:09:13,399 --> 02:09:14,600
What?

696
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:19,000
What does he land there? Does he land there? What what does he land? He land on me?

697
02:09:19,239 --> 02:09:20,920
Does he land on the top of the hill?

698
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,640
Was it the meteor was that him landing? I don't know

699
02:09:24,279 --> 02:09:44,229
In meteor. All right, that's one

700
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:48,020
I just keep summoning people

701
02:09:48,020 --> 02:09:51,619
Yeah, like the worst part about that though is you need to just ride around like a dickhead

702
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:57,859
And like sometimes it's hard to know where they're gonna spawn and turning and turning you back to try to look and see if you're

703
02:09:57,859 --> 02:10:01,220
In the right direction. It's just you're just gonna get hit by a fucking one of these dumb things

704
02:10:01,939 --> 02:10:08,970
I okay. I need to figure out what the solution is here

705
02:10:09,529 --> 02:10:12,970
Because if I get on the horse and he does the fucking purple thing i'm fucked

706
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:17,050
Like can I just out? I don't think I can outrun this and I

707
02:10:17,850 --> 02:10:19,899
It's so hard to tell

708
02:10:19,899 --> 02:10:22,439
I think I can

709
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:31,909
Like everybody

710
02:10:31,989 --> 02:10:38,329
I don't know you really really like are you fucking kidding me, dude?

711
02:10:57,340 --> 02:10:58,699
Like everybody

712
02:10:58,699 --> 02:11:07,210
I think there's the ladies up here, right?

713
02:11:07,609 --> 02:11:10,680
I don't know. I can't there's I can't turn my back

714
02:11:11,079 --> 02:11:54,039
Man, come on. Is there any more signs?

715
02:11:54,760 --> 02:12:10,279
Just drive around

716
02:12:10,279 --> 02:12:16,300
I don't see any more signs

717
02:12:16,619 --> 02:12:18,619
I wonder if they just recently

718
02:12:20,619 --> 02:12:43,720
Get them more more more people more people

719
02:12:44,859 --> 02:12:51,659
Oh shit, I lost him

720
02:12:51,659 --> 02:13:07,050
God damn it

721
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:08,890
i'm fucking dead

722
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:20,329
I don't I don't understand why that move is it is that in this it seems like how the fuck me what are you supposed to do?

723
02:13:21,689 --> 02:13:25,390
Like what how do you fucking avoid that move? Is it even possible?

724
02:13:26,329 --> 02:13:35,289
How big that fucking move is I can dodge roll it but i'm on the fucking horse

725
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:42,390
I'm so dead

726
02:13:42,390 --> 02:14:01,340
All right up on the hill

727
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:06,060
We're running around doing that. Well, I mean I can't it's hard to close the gap if i'm gonna hit him and do like fucking

728
02:14:06,539 --> 02:14:15,750
40 damage

729
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:24,579
That moves dumb

730
02:14:24,579 --> 02:14:25,939
You all know it

731
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:34,630
That moves dumb

732
02:14:34,630 --> 02:14:36,630
That's a dumb move

733
02:14:37,109 --> 02:14:42,300
Let me just try to fight him

734
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:46,600
I'm gonna try to get up just to just to fight him either bleed or freeze

735
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:53,859
I feel like I can get him to at least phase two. I think the bow is takes way too long as as safe as you are

736
02:14:54,659 --> 02:14:58,060
using the bow

737
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:01,020
Look at how long it takes. I mean, you don't need to see it, but it's just like one

738
02:15:01,659 --> 02:15:02,619
two

739
02:15:02,619 --> 02:15:03,659
three

740
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:08,300
Four five. It's like it's just you aren't you're in such a bad position. I'm just gonna fight him. I'm just gonna fucking fight

741
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:10,619
Let's go

742
02:15:10,619 --> 02:15:13,420
I'm just gonna get in there and i'm gonna kick his ass

743
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:19,380
That's it. I'm just gonna go i'm gonna go kick the shit out of him face to face one on one

744
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:22,100
With a bunch of friends and then that's it

745
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:36,010
Can I outrun this?

746
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:41,399
Because getting on the horse is like such a bad idea right here because he'll do the purple shot

747
02:15:42,199 --> 02:15:47,130
I can outrun it. All right, I don't need to get on the horse

748
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:49,130
Really?

749
02:15:49,130 --> 02:16:01,689
You buddy let's go

750
02:16:01,689 --> 02:16:04,170
Let's all get in there and fight him as one as a team

751
02:16:20,869 --> 02:16:23,189
There's too much going on too many people

752
02:16:24,149 --> 02:16:26,390
Way too many bodies

753
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:30,470
Uh, it's hard so many sound effects. It's almost I can't tell who's even doing move

754
02:16:31,029 --> 02:16:36,979
You're supposed to get on the horse

755
02:16:36,979 --> 02:16:44,840
All right. How many attempts is that before I just like never come back to this shitty piece of fucking garbage fight ever again

756
02:16:48,620 --> 02:17:10,659
three, okay, just gotta do this seven more fucking times I

757
02:17:13,989 --> 02:17:15,590
Fucking hate this

758
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:17,590
Just kill me like a what?

759
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:26,090
Somebody said this took them four days to do what the fuck

760
02:17:32,979 --> 02:17:35,219
No, that counts that counts that counts

761
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:47,559
I'll summon oleg. I'm gonna summon oleg and let him get one hit killed

762
02:17:48,120 --> 02:18:02,059
Dude, honestly, I think i'm gonna fight this boss without the hut too, by the way

763
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:05,909
You know what I mean? Like i'm just gonna turn the hut off because like what's all this info on the screen?

764
02:18:05,909 --> 02:18:45,659
I don't want to fucking see it

765
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:58,069
47 fucking damage

766
02:18:58,489 --> 02:19:17,700
Dude, will you stop fucking swinging? Oh my god

767
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:47,459
Is this like a fucking movie i'm watching or do I get to fight the guy oleg get out here

768
02:19:49,659 --> 02:19:53,420
Get to be off the horse. How come I can't summon what?

769
02:19:54,059 --> 02:19:59,670
Why not? I can't summon

770
02:20:00,069 --> 02:20:07,379
I can't summon them here

771
02:20:07,379 --> 02:20:09,459
Everyone yelling at me to summon oleg. I can't

772
02:20:14,489 --> 02:20:17,079
I got a better idea

773
02:20:17,079 --> 02:20:18,760
All right

774
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,200
new plan

775
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,200
New plan for the last five attempts

776
02:20:23,219 --> 02:20:30,389
My hand goes through my monitor

777
02:20:30,469 --> 02:20:32,520
new plan

778
02:20:32,520 --> 02:20:33,399
uh

779
02:20:33,399 --> 02:20:39,579
Do I have

780
02:20:39,579 --> 02:20:43,739
I this is not gonna this is not gonna cut it. This might though. Hold on

781
02:20:46,090 --> 02:20:48,090
Maybe I should just sit there and just like

782
02:20:50,819 --> 02:20:54,100
These things happen quick swift ones

783
02:20:55,059 --> 02:21:10,010
I don't think anything else is worth doing. I'm honest. I think I just eat

784
02:21:10,649 --> 02:21:13,930
I think I just have yeah, I mean i'm gonna get i'm gonna lose but

785
02:21:14,649 --> 02:21:28,250
I'm just gonna be an absolute coward and we're just gonna swift glintstone fucking run around and just pick them

786
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:36,540
Yeah, I I only have one sacred tier on these flasks, which is really awful

787
02:21:37,700 --> 02:21:39,700
If I can't get it, i'm just i'm not ready for it

788
02:21:41,299 --> 02:21:45,299
Activate rune arcs. Yeah, but if I die with a rune arc, isn't that just gonna delete the rune arc?

789
02:21:45,299 --> 02:21:48,979
Wow, I wouldn't want to use that at a boss. I'm not comfortable getting 50% of his health down

790
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:56,870
Anything besides the bow is probably too short range

791
02:21:58,809 --> 02:22:02,329
I'll try it. It's just a humanity

792
02:22:03,459 --> 02:22:06,340
I cannot use my summons, but they're not allowed in that area

793
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:11,260
I can summon the people on the ground but the hardest part for me so far has been

794
02:22:11,979 --> 02:22:13,500
All right, you summon everybody

795
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:16,700
You do the orcs must die bullshit in the first fucking minute and a half of the fight

796
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:21,579
I'm getting on my horse and like I gotta like go around and touch the summoning signs

797
02:22:21,579 --> 02:22:24,520
But sometimes I'll lose the walk-on

798
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:26,840
And then I then he just I can't even fucking see him

799
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:30,979
All right

800
02:22:30,979 --> 02:22:35,139
I'm gonna just be a wuss and we're gonna swift glintstone them over and over again

801
02:22:38,899 --> 02:22:46,700
In fact, i'm gonna put the sword away. I'm not gonna use it. I was gonna hold this in two hands

802
02:22:51,799 --> 02:22:53,799
Go take a csgo

803
02:22:54,120 --> 02:23:00,920
Break

804
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:05,639
All right. I got five more attempts before i'm turning around and running away from this bullshit

805
02:23:07,930 --> 02:23:09,930
The festival is nigh

806
02:23:10,809 --> 02:23:14,489
I'm just gonna stay the fuck away from and just be very very cautious

807
02:23:15,899 --> 02:23:18,409
Before we begin

808
02:23:18,409 --> 02:23:20,409
I only have two heels though, which is bad

809
02:23:29,530 --> 02:23:44,969
I don't need to talk to him. Oh, okay. It's good to know use the buffs bow and spam the bow

810
02:23:45,850 --> 02:23:50,500
I I have to stand in the circle, which that's like just guaranteed to die

811
02:23:51,219 --> 02:23:55,379
I have to stand inside of that little buff circle. It doesn't it's not it doesn't stay on me

812
02:24:07,909 --> 02:24:11,030
I know i'm not supposed to be doing this. I'm not i'm under leveled. I know

813
02:24:11,989 --> 02:24:16,389
I'm under geared. I'm coming in here at the wrong time. I know

814
02:24:23,299 --> 02:24:25,299
I know i'm missing flasks. I know

815
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:28,889
What it's called being a stubborn little shit

816
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,559
Get out of the way

817
02:24:53,559 --> 02:25:05,850
Eat my ass. I'm serious

818
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:30,950
I'm not even fucking kidding. Yeah, it's not it's bow. It's bow or nothing

819
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:42,260
Do it very slowly

820
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:47,639
slow

821
02:25:47,639 --> 02:25:49,639
It's gonna find the other summoning sign right here

822
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:55,479
I don't know if I got it or not. It's so fucking hard to tell

823
02:25:59,909 --> 02:26:01,799
Where is he?

824
02:26:01,799 --> 02:26:04,440
I don't know what the fuck out god god god god god god

825
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:47,129
What the fuck dude, what are you curving around his fucking body?

826
02:26:47,850 --> 02:27:21,530
What was that?

827
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:22,649
Damn it

828
02:27:22,649 --> 02:27:51,750
Just the opportunity is so small to hurt him. I just have to run around and just don't even attack him

829
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:57,100
Just get the shots that I can get off and then half the summons hurt him. They keep spawning. I guess

830
02:27:58,459 --> 02:28:13,610
I don't fucking know

831
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:23,559
Any more summons?

832
02:28:23,559 --> 02:28:25,719
We're doing coward play right here. I don't care

833
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:39,739
It's real coward gameplay right now

834
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:51,430
I have no shame

835
02:28:51,430 --> 02:28:55,110
Oh my god. I thought he was aiming the out way. I didn't think it was gonna come this way

836
02:28:55,909 --> 02:29:10,569
All right more summoning symbols. Where are they?

837
02:29:11,209 --> 02:29:29,049
Thought I saw one over here. No, fuck off. It's three people next to you dude. Get out of here

838
02:29:54,170 --> 02:30:16,809
Summoning signs

839
02:30:16,809 --> 02:30:18,809
Oh shit

840
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:48,729
Where is everybody

841
02:30:48,729 --> 02:30:50,889
Why he baited me he fucking actually baited me

842
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:54,790
That was actual bait right there

843
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:58,549
Okay, watch over the meteor meteor meteor meteor watch over the meteor. Where's the meteor?

844
02:30:59,350 --> 02:31:01,610
Where is it?

845
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:02,969
Where's the meteor?

846
02:31:02,969 --> 02:31:27,540
Oh my god

847
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:30,899
I'm so scared. I don't want to go close to him. This is for the meatballs

848
02:31:36,020 --> 02:31:43,579
You know, i'm terrified

849
02:31:43,579 --> 02:31:46,459
I'm gonna shoot the bow and the meatballs gonna kill me

850
02:31:53,770 --> 02:31:55,770
What the fuck you?

851
02:32:08,069 --> 02:32:09,829
What killed the wolf?

852
02:32:09,829 --> 02:32:12,139
Why did the both die?

853
02:32:13,180 --> 02:32:15,610
Get on a horse

854
02:32:15,610 --> 02:32:19,129
Dude, I fucking can't with that goddamn move

855
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:23,350
I was

856
02:32:23,350 --> 02:32:34,629
Slow and steady if you're on you can't you're just gonna just do that fucking move and pull you in

857
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:49,979
Don't use the horse. Do you you understand how fast i'm gonna fucking die if I don't use the horse?

858
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:58,020
I I I have fucking 25 points in dexterity. I'm in trouble if I get off that fucking horse

859
02:32:58,979 --> 02:33:14,540
The only way that I can do that off the horse is if I just just try to just learn all of it

860
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:16,540
But that's gonna be fucking impossible

861
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:21,540
I wonder how many people beat this off the horse. I feel like it's like you're not supposed to

862
02:33:22,899 --> 02:33:27,299
Because he's on a horse and we've already seen if somebody's on a horse get on a horse

863
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:34,920
I just like

864
02:33:35,479 --> 02:33:39,639
I freaked out. I fucking freaked out

865
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:05,270
You've got five people around you

866
02:34:05,989 --> 02:35:06,540
All right summon fuck that's worked every other time just running sprinting

867
02:35:08,459 --> 02:35:15,110
All right, how many is that how many is that I usually sprint diagonally and I don't get hit

868
02:35:17,399 --> 02:35:20,600
I'm i'm gonna cut it short. I don't think I can do it without more upgrades

869
02:35:23,639 --> 02:35:25,639
I don't think I can I don't think I can do without upgrades

870
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:28,760
I need at least like a plus three flask

871
02:35:29,479 --> 02:35:30,440
and

872
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:34,409
I just want to fucking throw a grenade at this guy

873
02:35:38,379 --> 02:35:43,739
I have a plus one flask. What am I my fucking idiot? Like I have to drink like six extra potions

874
02:35:44,620 --> 02:36:16,950
Still don't understand that move. I just don't get it

875
02:36:18,819 --> 02:36:21,620
It's it's that you can't avoid it on foot and if you get on the horse

876
02:36:21,940 --> 02:36:24,899
You might get fucking hit by the purple thing if you get off the horse again

877
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:32,540
I can't dodge through it because it goes behind me. I don't I don't understand that

878
02:36:33,909 --> 02:36:34,149
All right

879
02:36:34,149 --> 02:36:36,149
So when I get on the horse if he does that move

880
02:36:36,629 --> 02:36:41,590
And I outrun it with the horse and he does the purple charge beam as I he's gonna hit me with it

881
02:36:41,829 --> 02:36:45,110
He's gonna fucking hit me with it. What what the fuck were they thinking?

882
02:38:32,739 --> 02:38:36,340
I don't have a fucking regular ass weapon out. What are you thinking bro? What are you doing?

883
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:38,420
I don't have a fucking regular weapon out

884
02:39:03,750 --> 02:39:21,399
Don't lose lock on

885
02:39:21,399 --> 02:39:23,719
I don't know why I keep i'm freaking out about that one now

886
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:39,700
All right summon there's a couple up here

887
02:39:40,260 --> 02:39:43,559
At least it should be right

888
02:39:43,559 --> 02:39:57,700
No

889
02:39:57,700 --> 02:39:59,379
Where is it?

890
02:39:59,379 --> 02:40:03,770
It's back here somewhere

891
02:40:03,770 --> 02:40:17,850
Where are they over there?

892
02:40:18,809 --> 02:40:33,139
Fuck you. Fuck you. I can't avoid that. I have to get hit by it every time

893
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:48,889
Dude, no god damn it the fucking turning radius. Oh my god. I hate this fucking thing

894
02:40:48,969 --> 02:41:02,149
I hate if you could even call it that if you could even call it that I like I turned but the horse went like

895
02:41:02,870 --> 02:41:04,069
like

896
02:41:04,069 --> 02:41:29,799
That way that one was going pretty well too. It's just you get like if you get like caught a tenth of a second

897
02:41:31,079 --> 02:41:34,360
I just don't I don't I don't want to be a fucking mile away from a goddamn boss like fucking

898
02:41:35,799 --> 02:41:44,340
See what I mean? He didn't do the fucking thing. He didn't do the thing. He did the purple shit instead

899
02:41:44,979 --> 02:41:46,979
And he did the purple shit again

900
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:54,899
And now he's gonna do the I hate him. I fucking hate him. This guy gets a cap

901
02:41:55,459 --> 02:42:11,739
Somebody invading the game. Why is there a red guy?

902
02:42:12,459 --> 02:43:20,389
All right, right there back there

903
02:43:30,069 --> 02:43:37,770
Get it. That is such a dog shit fucking

904
02:43:38,090 --> 02:44:05,989
I tried to jump at the right time

905
02:44:06,629 --> 02:44:15,610
You're running to you're running circles around him instead of running away

906
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:19,610
But if I run away I lose the lock on and I like turn that way and fucking sucks

907
02:44:20,569 --> 02:44:49,610
Oh, that's

908
02:45:04,440 --> 02:45:06,760
And he's also faster than me too. That's another thing

909
02:45:08,299 --> 02:45:10,780
He pursues me. He's gonna close the gap because he's faster

910
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:33,129
Where are those summoning things over there?

911
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:35,780
Fuck you

912
02:45:36,500 --> 02:46:20,790
This boss is from knack three they should have kept him there. I don't know summoning signs back behind me. I think

913
02:46:22,489 --> 02:46:29,909
I'm not gonna beat him one. I'm gonna back. I'm gonna go here

914
02:46:30,389 --> 02:46:37,239
It's a really stupid idea. But whatever

915
02:46:42,229 --> 02:46:43,270
I don't know

916
02:46:43,270 --> 02:46:50,649
I don't see me. Oh my goodness. This is bad. What the fuck did you come from? Well do something. What? Hey

917
02:46:51,450 --> 02:46:58,409
What was that?

918
02:46:58,409 --> 02:47:02,329
All right, I give up. I give up this guy sucks. I'll be back later

919
02:47:03,129 --> 02:47:16,549
He's going in the air. All right

920
02:47:17,110 --> 02:47:23,340
Meteor I don't know where it is. Where the fuck is it?

921
02:47:25,620 --> 02:47:27,700
I don't know. I don't know

922
02:47:38,219 --> 02:47:40,940
I can't do anything. I have to just run around

923
02:47:43,909 --> 02:47:58,040
I can't even fight the guy. I just have to sit here and stare at him. Yeah, just go fight him. Fuck off everybody

924
02:47:58,040 --> 02:48:02,200
Go fight him. I'll watch i'll watch the stupid ass thing. Go fight him

925
02:48:03,590 --> 02:48:07,829
Eventually, maybe somebody will do enough chip damage where I can fucking be out of here

926
02:48:22,659 --> 02:48:24,979
I'll stay all the fucking way back here. I don't give a shit

927
02:48:25,780 --> 02:48:30,969
Is anyone hurting him? Oh, there we go. 193. You see that

928
02:48:36,569 --> 02:48:39,770
Someone will kill him. Somebody will kill this guy

929
02:48:44,790 --> 02:49:45,299
Are there any more summoning soap signs? I don't see any more. Oh shit. Oh, I can't see

930
02:49:51,559 --> 02:49:54,059
What the fuck happened?

931
02:49:58,459 --> 02:50:04,379
Where did that come from?

932
02:50:04,379 --> 02:50:06,379
Oh this this little

933
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:07,989

934
02:50:07,989 --> 02:50:10,069
I'm so upset at this

935
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:15,860
You gotta be fucking kidding me. Oh, I am I am very annoyed

936

942
02:52:02,709 --> 02:52:04,709
So we're gonna do something else

943
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:11,299

Am I still frame dropping what the that's also pissing me off

02:53:38,229 --> 02:53:40,229
Why am I dropping so many frames?

959
02:53:40,469 --> 02:53:45,430
I have I have fucking gigabit thousand thousand internet connection. What is going on?

960
02:53:46,229 --> 02:53:50,780
This is like my internet connection can't get better than this

961
02:53:51,340 --> 02:54:05,739
Like I physically can't get a better connection

962
02:54:06,379 --> 02:54:08,739
Look at how sweaty I am. Holy shit

963
02:54:10,579 --> 02:54:13,219
Why do you look like this because i'm deranged right now. Okay

964
02:54:16,139 --> 02:54:24,120
I know what we can do. I have an idea. Let's go kill the dragon. Let's go kill the the dragon that's over here. That's good

965
02:54:31,700 --> 02:54:34,120
That's something I can do

966
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:35,399
That sounds like fun

967
02:54:35,399 --> 02:54:50,010
Because I I know I can kill the dragon. It's been a while

968
02:54:50,729 --> 02:55:24,920
We do a brb. Uh, if I don't beat the dragon in three tries, I will be Rebecca. Oh my god. That's the vendor

969
02:55:25,239 --> 02:55:29,000
Oh my god, that's the vendor. I just was like mad. So I just attacked a guy

970
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:32,120
No, don't kill the vendor, please

971
02:55:37,879 --> 02:55:40,200
Okay, geez, I don't want to kill the vendor

Next time you fight that boss, don't use the party finder. It's full of morons

979
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:35,209
Stop is it safe for me to drop down from here or i'm gonna die

02:58:13,190 --> 02:58:15,670
carry out absolution at the church of vows

992
02:58:17,879 --> 02:58:19,379
reversing all

993
02:58:19,379 --> 02:58:20,840
antagonizations

994
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:30,569
Is this so I bring that to the turtle and I can reverse people that are angry

995
02:58:31,290 --> 02:58:40,629
interesting

996
02:58:40,629 --> 02:58:44,389
Okay, that's weird. It makes npcs not mad at you. Ah, all right

997
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:47,270
Uh, okay. I need to go

998
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:52,250
No, what's the fastest way to get there?

999
02:58:52,250 --> 02:58:53,690
I think it probably

1000
02:58:53,690 --> 02:59:02,729
You still have plus a one flask. I know but like I don't

1001
02:59:03,290 --> 02:59:05,370
This world is so huge that it's like

1002
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:08,700
I need to I don't know what they are

1003
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:12,700
I think they're like churches, but like I need to where is it? I need to find a church

1004
02:59:17,530 --> 02:59:25,540
I'll get it soon. Don't worry. I feel like i've come across random churches. Maybe would they be on the map?

1005
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:28,899
like that right

1006
02:59:28,899 --> 02:59:32,180
So like in here like but I feel like i've gotten that one already

1007
02:59:34,899 --> 02:59:36,899
Did I get this this is a church?

1008
02:59:37,059 --> 02:59:40,790
technically

1009
02:59:40,790 --> 02:59:42,790
No dragon. No, no, i'm going for the dragon right now

1010
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:46,100
I just want to get a better uh place to do it

1011
02:59:46,739 --> 02:59:53,159
So if we go I gotta go this can I jump over this?

1012
02:59:53,959 --> 02:59:59,110
What's the best actual way to go to get here from probably one of these this one?

1013
02:59:59,989 --> 03:00:01,510
That's a cave

1014
03:00:01,510 --> 03:00:04,329
this one here

1015
03:00:04,329 --> 03:00:08,520
Because I can jump i'm trying to just not die because you die from the fall damage there

1016
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:16,969
Yeah, it's this one here. Yeah. All right. Let me go kill this dragon. Let me try to

1017
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:41,739
See if i'm gonna do it

1018
03:00:41,739 --> 03:00:44,860
Frames are still dropping. I I have no idea what's going on

1019
03:00:47,219 --> 03:00:48,979
That should not be happening

1020
03:00:48,979 --> 03:00:50,979
But it apparently is

1021
03:00:51,059 --> 03:00:54,899
I don't know if it's twitch server problem or I don't know if it's a connection my connection problem

1022
03:00:55,940 --> 03:00:57,379
but

1023
03:00:57,379 --> 03:00:59,750
I don't know it's weird

1024
03:00:59,750 --> 03:01:02,680
I'm gonna start connecting to a different twitch server

1025
03:01:03,079 --> 03:01:07,319
I feel like the one i'm connecting to is like a piece of shit. So i'm gonna connect something else

1026
03:01:08,969 --> 03:01:12,010
Next stream I will connect to a different ingest server

1027
03:01:12,809 --> 03:01:14,809
I feel like that's part of the problem

1028
03:01:15,049 --> 03:02:10,250
Okay, let me see if I can kill him. Here we go. Do it. What was that?

1029
03:02:10,969 --> 03:03:01,899
Is he gonna use me?

1030
03:03:01,899 --> 03:03:08,299
I don't like this place, but I don't like fighting him here

1031
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:29,850
I don't want to fight him against the wall

1032
03:03:33,770 --> 03:03:37,159
Thank you for moving I appreciate

1033
03:03:37,159 --> 03:04:02,459
What are you doing?

1034
03:04:02,459 --> 03:04:03,899
What are you doing?

1035
03:04:03,899 --> 03:04:05,590
What's he doing?

1036
03:04:05,590 --> 03:04:13,659
What are you doing?

1037
03:04:13,659 --> 03:04:15,659
Being a weirdo. What are you doing?

1038
03:04:15,659 --> 03:04:18,010
Why are you being such a weirdo?

1039
03:04:18,010 --> 03:05:09,959
What are you doing?

1040
03:05:09,959 --> 03:05:18,409
Not against the wall get out of there

1041
03:06:21,350 --> 03:07:12,860
Watch out for the giant slug. Where'd he go? I'm not gonna fight a giant slug right now. Hey

1042
03:07:13,500 --> 03:07:28,649
All right. I'm good. Oh

1043
03:07:28,729 --> 03:08:04,309
Shit, I jumped. I didn't I jumped twice. What happened? He killed me in one hit

1044
03:08:04,950 --> 03:08:07,260
What happened what

1045
03:08:07,260 --> 03:08:11,500
What happened? I jumped I double jumped and hit him. I hit my head on the ceiling

1046
03:08:12,059 --> 03:08:13,020
What?

1047
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:15,020
I died in one hit

1048
03:08:16,649 --> 03:08:19,180
What?

1049
03:08:19,180 --> 03:08:21,180
That's no

1050
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:22,979
No

1051
03:08:22,979 --> 03:08:26,870
No

1052
03:08:26,870 --> 03:08:30,950
He landed he landed but I like jumped and he landed I touched his like

1053
03:08:31,750 --> 03:08:32,950
Buddy

1054
03:08:32,950 --> 03:08:36,149
That was so sad one hit

1055
03:08:38,010 --> 03:08:42,090
Oh my god, i'm so defeated right now like what the

1056
03:08:42,649 --> 03:08:44,170

1057
03:08:44,170 --> 03:08:46,860
What?

1058
03:09:01,190 --> 03:09:06,389
I guess i'm gonna just somebody said be aggressive. Yeah, I was trying to be slow and smart

1059
03:09:08,950 --> 03:09:13,270
But fuck man if I can die in one hit am I like not supposed to be fighting this guy either

1060
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:19,579
Go

1061
03:09:20,549 --> 03:09:22,979
How is what's going on

1062
03:09:22,979 --> 03:09:25,540
I've landed on this rock fucking a hundred times

1063
03:09:26,180 --> 03:09:27,139
What?

1064
03:09:27,219 --> 03:09:38,979
That doesn't count i've jumped on that rock three five thousand times in a row

1065
03:09:39,700 --> 03:09:41,700
What what the fuck is going on?

1066
03:09:42,260 --> 03:09:44,260
Where did you just put me?

1067
03:09:44,500 --> 03:09:50,149
No, it doesn't count. Jeremy, you are so stressed. Take a break

1068
03:09:52,579 --> 03:09:54,579
That was so that was horse shit

1069
03:09:56,299 --> 03:09:58,299
Why did I die in one hit?

1070
03:10:00,920 --> 03:10:05,399
I feel like i've gotten hit by that move. Okay. So tell me what the fuck is going on right now because literally i've

1071
03:10:05,719 --> 03:10:07,479
Is it the double jump?

1072
03:10:07,479 --> 03:10:10,739
I guess I

1073
03:10:11,159 --> 03:10:13,559
I'm just gonna be super aggressive and if it gets me killed whatever

1074
03:10:17,530 --> 03:10:19,530
Go directly south of the dragon

1075
03:10:23,209 --> 03:10:40,680
Right here. I want to see look. All right. I understand that you want to shoot a whole map full of fucking magic

1076
03:10:40,680 --> 03:10:42,840
But like look, can I please see my fucking map?

1077
03:10:43,799 --> 03:11:16,299
Thank god. I don't even fucking think about it. You're pushing my buttons right now

1078
03:11:28,420 --> 03:11:31,620
A little there's a little island here. I just you said there's one here

1079
03:11:32,579 --> 03:11:34,180
All right, save me

1080
03:11:34,180 --> 03:11:59,659
Did I beat the dragon? No, he killed me in one hit

1081
03:12:00,299 --> 03:12:08,520
I have full health which leads me to believe that I either got like omega stomped

1082
03:12:09,079 --> 03:12:12,389
Or I like wasn't i'm still not supposed to fight that guy

1083
03:12:14,780 --> 03:12:20,489
All right. Well, you said go to the island. What's on the island? I mean, it's lily

1084
03:12:21,129 --> 03:12:28,899
What's the island this island? Is there a flask thing on one of these islands?

1085
03:12:30,819 --> 03:12:35,750
Far out of the cell. You mean like you mean like all the way down here

1086
03:12:36,389 --> 03:12:44,090
Like way south i'm gonna go all the way down there

1087
03:12:46,219 --> 03:12:52,329
Okay, this is crazy. This is a whole nother content

1088
03:12:53,290 --> 03:13:02,489
Go this way

1089
03:13:02,489 --> 03:13:05,870
I thought this was like the end of the world. There's another way to go. That's fucking ridiculous

1090
03:13:18,709 --> 03:13:21,350
What's back here? I feel like i've done this part

1091
03:13:22,389 --> 03:13:26,739
Let me just check

1092
03:13:26,979 --> 03:13:28,979
Starlight shards

1093
03:13:46,329 --> 03:13:53,239
All right. So the what am I looking for down here? Is it gonna kill me?

1094
03:13:54,489 --> 03:14:00,309
I'm not okay

1095
03:14:00,309 --> 03:14:02,549
Southern island is is is pretty easy

1096
03:14:03,350 --> 03:14:09,510
Oh you you mean you want me to oh was this the way for you guys to get me away from like the hard shit?

1097
03:14:09,510 --> 03:14:11,510
That's making me want to fucking

1098
03:14:11,510 --> 03:14:13,510
Smash my webcam into 100 pieces

1099
03:14:16,979 --> 03:14:18,100
Oh, okay

1100
03:14:18,100 --> 03:14:38,459
All right. I can still be on the horse

1101
03:14:38,969 --> 03:14:40,969
I'm gonna get to one of those, uh gray states

1102
03:15:12,569 --> 03:15:14,569
All right, give me a bonfire so I can take a quick break

1103
03:15:17,829 --> 03:15:21,190
Smashing my fucking head against a wall fighting a boss i'm not supposed to be fighting

1104
03:15:22,329 --> 03:15:23,690
who has

1105
03:15:23,690 --> 03:15:25,610
a shit

1106
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:31,850
Shit encounter i'm gonna go down here and i'm gonna have a great time

1107
03:15:32,409 --> 03:15:47,290
Okay, here we go. I've been holding my key i'm going i'm going i'm going let's go. Let's go. Let's go

1108
03:15:48,010 --> 03:21:09,110
All right, i'm right back

1109
03:21:09,110 --> 03:22:28,280
All right. I'm back. Let's try this again

1110
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:53,270
Let's go for it. Hello. How are you? So where where am I?

1111
03:22:55,510 --> 03:23:03,899
bridge of sacrifice

1112
03:23:03,899 --> 03:23:10,459
shito, okay

1113
03:23:10,459 --> 03:23:12,729
where

1114
03:23:12,729 --> 03:23:19,579
Even is shito. I think so. All right, let's go

1115
03:23:20,700 --> 03:23:23,819
Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. I'm gonna go back to the bridge and we go down

1116
03:23:24,139 --> 03:23:34,780
Or I gotta get all these markers. Is that how can I can I just clear all the markers that I have?

1117
03:23:35,420 --> 03:23:37,340
I I feel like this should be a fast way to do this

1118
03:23:37,979 --> 03:23:44,860
And I just like because if i'm gonna be down here

1119
03:23:45,420 --> 03:23:51,219
I don't want these on the map. Okay

1120
03:23:53,139 --> 03:23:54,100
uh

1121
03:23:54,100 --> 03:23:59,260
this way

1122
03:23:59,260 --> 03:24:19,770
Back in a new npc. Hello. Is somebody there? Might I bend your ear for a moment, please? My name is arena

1123
03:24:20,489 --> 03:24:22,489
I've escaped from castle

1124
03:24:22,729 --> 03:24:25,370
No, that's uh, that's laniya have rebelled

1125
03:24:25,930 --> 03:24:28,739
I can't be sure what it is

1126
03:24:29,139 --> 03:24:34,899
My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see but I swear I heard frightful howling from all over

1127
03:24:35,379 --> 03:24:39,780
My good father secreted me out the castle but decided himself to stay

1128
03:24:41,059 --> 03:24:43,059
He says it's his duty

1129
03:24:43,540 --> 03:24:49,540
As commander red nose, you can just see like that. Is it all the anger is hanging out right now? It's like here

1130
03:24:51,049 --> 03:24:53,049
I look like i'm fucking trashed

1131
03:24:54,260 --> 03:25:00,729
I look shit-faced. I look like i've had like seven beers today like I look trashed

1132
03:25:01,370 --> 03:25:08,440
The servants are full of wrath. They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with

1133
03:25:09,159 --> 03:25:11,000
They haven't spared a soul

1134
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:17,319
I fear it's no different at castle morning. Please don't mind taking a letter to my father and my soul wishes that he escaped

1135
03:25:18,200 --> 03:25:20,680
Even if his honor should be the price take a letter, please

1136
03:25:22,040 --> 03:25:24,040
I just want him to be safe. Okay

1137
03:25:24,840 --> 03:25:28,840
Uh, yeah, thank you i'll do it i'll deliver the letter then please

1138
03:25:30,280 --> 03:25:35,290
Marina's letter deliver it to my father who remains in the castle if you please

1139
03:25:36,010 --> 03:25:39,979
i'll try

1140
03:25:39,979 --> 03:25:42,299
Ah promise I won't read the note though

1141
03:25:43,899 --> 03:25:45,899
And promise i'm not going to read it

1142
03:25:45,979 --> 03:25:50,090
let's say

1143
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:51,670
ah

1144
03:25:51,670 --> 03:25:57,909
Gorgeous silicon handkerchief lightly stained with blood words can be made out with that's not what's on the letter. That's what it's made out of

1145
03:25:58,870 --> 03:26:02,459
I'll read it

1146
03:26:02,459 --> 03:26:06,170
What if it says like assassinate the guy that gave you this letter? What if it says that?

1147
03:26:16,600 --> 03:26:20,920
Fucking hate that encounter. I feel like I feel like happy gilmore right now

1148
03:26:22,100 --> 03:26:24,100
Like i'm just like still mad about it

1149
03:26:25,159 --> 03:26:27,159
i'm still so fucking mad about it

1150
03:26:29,180 --> 03:26:33,260
I even like took a minute. I like put some water in my face and I was just like just relax, man

1151
03:26:33,979 --> 03:26:50,090
This looks like it's gonna be tricky. I think it's time to call in a little bit of support here. Oh leg the commander

1152
03:26:57,299 --> 03:26:59,299
Nice, okay

1153
03:27:00,500 --> 03:27:02,569
All right

1154
03:27:02,569 --> 03:27:04,250

1169
03:28:15,610 --> 03:28:19,829

Is that an npc or is it a i've got to fight let's find out

1174
03:28:37,479 --> 03:28:39,479

1175
03:28:39,479 --> 03:29:06,280

Good team

1178
03:29:16,090 --> 03:29:19,610
All right. I definitely feel like I am a little bit leveled for this area

1179
03:29:22,540 --> 03:29:24,379
Morning star cool

1180
03:29:24,379 --> 03:29:32,139
Anything on this side? No. Oleg seems pretty basic. There he is

1181
03:29:34,389 --> 03:29:36,389
He's a new enemy

1182
03:29:41,030 --> 03:29:46,280
Oh, yeah, let's go let's just wipe the floor with this area

1183
03:29:47,399 --> 03:29:52,940
Okay, I thought that was Oleg for a second. I was like what are you doing, man?

1184
03:29:53,180 --> 03:29:54,379
Oh

1185
03:29:54,379 --> 03:29:56,680
Why is he even doing 25 damage?

1186
03:29:57,799 --> 03:30:00,549
I feel like he should be way more

1187
03:30:22,149 --> 03:30:34,549
Oh mighty shot mighty shot. What else we got?

1188
03:30:36,459 --> 03:30:38,739

Let's keep going dude. Sometimes you have to if you've got like, okay

1232
03:36:53,479 --> 03:36:55,930
there's been cases where

1233
03:36:55,930 --> 03:36:59,450
I'm playing it like with you're at like a friend's or like someone's playing a game

1234
03:37:00,329 --> 03:37:01,610
and they're

1235
03:37:01,610 --> 03:37:06,090
And they're just they're just trapped and they're just like no I can do it

1236
03:37:06,409 --> 03:37:09,770
It's like, uh, you don't have you can like come back later. It's like kind of the it's kind of hard

1237
03:37:10,090 --> 03:37:14,409

1239
03:37:18,010 --> 03:37:21,690
They're just like gonna keep doing this and then they keep doing it

1240
03:37:21,930 --> 03:37:24,969
They lose over and over again and then you kind of just have to reach over at some point

1241
03:37:25,209 --> 03:37:27,290
And you fucking alt tab when you hit like the escape button

1242
03:37:28,170 --> 03:37:30,170
And it's just like yeah

1243
03:37:30,170 --> 03:37:34,090
Hey, and it's just like dude. I'm sorry. I had to fucking do that and then they go

1244
03:37:35,670 --> 03:37:36,950
Oh, okay

1245
03:37:36,950 --> 03:37:38,950
Why foods here foods here?

1246
03:37:39,110 --> 03:37:41,989
You know what I mean? Like you got sometimes you just have to alt tab the person

1247
03:37:42,549 --> 03:37:45,270
And just be like take second and just like think about what's happening right now

1248
03:37:46,250 --> 03:37:49,290
And they go look in the mirror and their nose is like big fucking red nose

1249
03:37:50,250 --> 03:38:02,520
But you've got to start like playing something like music or something just start playing like I don't like fucking party in the usa behind them

1250
03:38:02,520 --> 03:38:03,959
and they'll be like

1251
03:38:03,959 --> 03:38:09,659
The hands up they're playing what's going on behind me and then they and then you got them they got you got them out

1252
03:38:10,549 --> 03:38:11,829
You got them out

1253
03:38:11,829 --> 03:38:17,159
Now here's the problem. I'm gonna go back in eventually

Fire grease I can make a bunch of those too

03:44:54,229 --> 03:45:14,700
Remember, why do you kill so many people there's a better way than just violence. Um, okay. Well, here he is

1301
03:45:16,170 --> 03:45:18,329
Uh pumpkin, that's a pumpkin head guy

1302

The guy didn't even get to stand up

1303
03:45:25,129 --> 03:45:37,860
Have you tried talking to the monsters?

1304
03:45:40,379 --> 03:45:43,030
Yeah, i've been going

1305
03:45:43,030 --> 03:45:47,020
Like waving and they don't do anything. I keep going like this

1306
03:45:47,659 --> 03:45:49,959
And I don't understand. I keep going like

1307
03:45:52,969 --> 03:45:56,409
And i'm just trying to wave to him. I don't know. Nobody seems to be like trying to communicate

1308
03:45:57,290 --> 03:46:00,920
Get it

1309
03:46:00,920 --> 03:46:02,920
They keep walking like kind of forward

1310
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:07,639
And like maybe I hit them in like the face sometimes accidentally if it's not my fault. Like i'm just trying to say hi

1311
03:46:11,780 --> 03:46:14,409
Fucking wave at that guy

1312
03:46:16,250 --> 03:46:19,540
This game's fucking stupid like i'm trying to wave at people i'm trying not to hit anybody

1313
03:46:22,979 --> 03:46:26,020
That actually kind of pisses me off that you can't like just like, you know talk to them

1314
03:46:26,979 --> 03:46:31,829
Okay, at least the title of this stream is correct

1315
03:46:33,100 --> 03:46:35,340
For the first time in five streams, right?

1316
03:46:40,299 --> 03:46:41,260
Oh, hey

It keeps happening to me

1320
03:46:53,319 --> 03:47:17,620
Wave

1321
03:47:17,620 --> 03:47:19,620
Hit him with your sword

1322
03:47:20,040 --> 03:47:22,040
Wave at him harder

1323
03:47:22,040 --> 03:47:26,840
This is a youtube video stream

1324
03:47:29,909 --> 03:47:31,510
Like all of them could be

1325
03:47:31,510 --> 03:47:35,020
This is coping mechanism for me not to get mad. Don't you understand?

1326
03:47:38,950 --> 03:47:43,750
Contrary to what you guys might believe I am desperately trying not to eat a chunk of my monitor

1327
03:47:49,530 --> 03:47:51,690
Oh my goodness. That was a bad move

1328
03:47:52,409 --> 03:48:05,059
I want this item

1329
03:48:05,059 --> 03:48:24,819
What the hell is going on over there?

1330
03:48:24,819 --> 03:48:27,700
Yeah, it's called the big fish eat the little fish

1331
03:48:28,500 --> 03:48:32,020
I cut it in just like

1332
03:48:34,250 --> 03:48:36,489
Can you imagine there was something like that in like in humanity?

1333
03:48:37,209 --> 03:48:44,520
Like, you know the whale sharks that just like float forward just hold their mouths open and they eat like a hundred fucking million fish

1334
03:48:46,540 --> 03:48:52,059
Can you imagine him just you're just walking around outside and there was just this thing that was just moving slowly forward with his mouth open

1335
03:48:52,940 --> 03:48:54,540
be like

1336
03:48:54,540 --> 03:48:56,139
We're just we're just dead

1337
03:48:56,139 --> 03:48:59,100
Like this thing's gonna eat us like we're just gonna die. Like what do we do?

1338
03:49:01,129 --> 03:49:04,649
We're so lucky that spiders are as big as they are imagine spiders were as big as a house

1339
03:49:07,079 --> 03:49:08,520
Well, okay

1340
03:49:08,520 --> 03:49:25,799
But what do you do about that for you? There's a face i've not seen before

1341
03:49:26,520 --> 03:49:27,799
i'm edgar

1342
03:49:27,799 --> 03:49:34,120
Warden of this castle as ordained by lord godrigg himself edgar that you can see how things have turned out

1343
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:36,920
The menials have all rebelled

1344
03:49:37,559 --> 03:49:39,559
They gave me good service or so. I thought

1345
03:49:40,360 --> 03:49:42,360
But it seems it was all an act

1346
03:49:43,159 --> 03:49:47,879
Foul creatures as it said and true enough they're foul inside getting quieter

1347
03:49:48,520 --> 03:49:50,520
I'm sorry to disappoint you

1348
03:49:50,760 --> 03:49:54,780
But whatever you come here to do castle mourn

1349
03:49:55,420 --> 03:49:57,420
Won't hold much longer

1350
03:49:57,420 --> 03:49:59,420
Take this by way of apology

1351
03:50:00,840 --> 03:50:05,159
Something wrong with my headphones. Why is he quiet? He's so quiet

1352
03:50:05,959 --> 03:50:16,059
Give the letter

1353
03:50:16,139 --> 03:50:18,139
Oh my audio has been fucked up the whole time

1354
03:50:18,940 --> 03:50:20,940
Even if the castle should fall

1355
03:50:21,100 --> 03:50:23,100
As commander I must remain

1356
03:50:23,819 --> 03:50:28,780
To ensure the treasured sword of mourn does not fall into the hold of the morning

1357
03:50:31,110 --> 03:50:35,270
Okay, if you see arena do tell her her father will come for her

1358
03:50:35,829 --> 03:50:37,829
Once he's fulfilled his duty

1359
03:50:39,590 --> 03:50:41,590
If you see her father

1360
03:50:43,510 --> 03:50:44,950
Wait

1361
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:49,290

03:51:03,530 --> 03:51:05,530
Oh, I can upgrade my glass

1364
03:51:09,510 --> 03:51:13,110
Where is it? I don't know a little twig

1365
03:51:13,829 --> 03:51:26,040
It's an item. It's a talisman

1366
03:51:27,079 --> 03:51:29,079
Oh will be lost on okay

1367

So, uh, okay

Back into the castle

1371
03:51:57,340 --> 03:52:05,270
It did not go this way

1372
03:52:05,670 --> 03:52:10,309
Anything else over here?

1373
03:52:10,309 --> 03:52:11,750
Ah

1374
03:52:11,750 --> 03:52:15,340
Just need to take a moment. Okay

1375
03:52:17,319 --> 03:52:19,319
Take a cartoon bite out of your keyboard

1376
03:52:19,799 --> 03:52:27,739
What does this do for me? This i'm in like a bad spot. All right, whatever

1377
03:52:28,540 --> 03:52:33,399
I'm not gonna rest at that because I don't

1378
03:52:34,250 --> 03:52:40,649
Wait, what let's see if I can go this way

1379
03:52:40,809 --> 03:52:50,860
I don't think i'm gonna rest at that one. Maybe I should have it was a ball joke

1380
03:52:52,420 --> 03:53:04,040
You didn't I didn't even realize I could like that. Why isn't he doing it? Do what?

1381
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:10,979
So what you want me to lift up my keyboard and take like a big bite and have it be the

1382
03:53:11,700 --> 03:53:13,940
ice cream bar packaging bite

1383
03:53:14,500 --> 03:53:16,899
Which is like the corner of the top of the ice cream

1384
03:53:17,940 --> 03:53:19,940
I can't do that right now. I'm sorry

1385
03:53:28,120 --> 03:53:30,120
I I I already ate a shoe

1386
03:53:49,350 --> 03:53:50,870
Eating keyboards

1387
03:53:50,870 --> 03:53:55,780
Let's not down that

1388
03:53:56,020 --> 03:53:58,020
Wait, let's not down that

1389
03:53:58,100 --> 03:54:10,840
All right, be careful. I don't want to something's gonna happen here

1390
03:54:13,459 --> 03:54:18,819
Yes, no

1391
03:54:18,819 --> 03:54:27,260
Okay, so what's here?

1392
03:54:27,659 --> 03:54:31,420
What else

1393
03:54:31,420 --> 03:54:33,659
My wife and baby would love to watch you eat your keyboard

1394
03:54:34,540 --> 03:54:38,540
Your baby doesn't understand anything besides that. There's colors on the screen

1395
03:54:47,219 --> 03:54:56,170
Twin blade talisman

1396
03:54:56,170 --> 03:54:58,170
final hit of chain attacks

1397
03:54:59,819 --> 03:55:01,819
A lot of cool stuff, but not for me

1398
03:55:04,709 --> 03:55:10,260
Okay, that's that

1399
03:55:10,260 --> 03:55:13,299
Maybe sensory yeah, your baby doesn't understand what i'm saying

1400
03:55:16,170 --> 03:55:18,170
all your baby hears is just like

1401
03:55:23,350 --> 03:55:25,350
Um

1402
03:55:29,030 --> 03:55:34,860
It's literally all your baby understands finally after like a year or two your baby can like

1403
03:55:36,059 --> 03:55:38,379
My ears are developed for me can hear things

1404
03:55:50,260 --> 03:55:52,659
Like their eyes don't you understand that like a baby's eyes?

1405
03:55:53,299 --> 03:55:55,299
It's like they they can't see

1406
03:55:55,379 --> 03:55:59,559
They're like constantly developing their their senses

1407
03:56:05,610 --> 03:56:07,610
Mars attack alien

1408
03:56:07,690 --> 03:56:22,680
Nothing down there. Oh, is this all that was over here?

1409
03:56:24,040 --> 03:56:26,040
No, that's before

1410
03:56:26,120 --> 03:56:37,159
What else is over nothing? Let's go should go down. I can't go down

1411
03:56:39,110 --> 03:56:41,190
Oh, that's right. Oh nice

03:56:41,909 --> 03:56:43,909
All right, i'm stopping

1413
03:56:43,909 --> 03:56:54,579
That's enough. What's going on? What's going on over there is what I want to know

1414
03:56:55,139 --> 03:57:08,729
Who's over there? Oh, no father gravestone. Of course

03:57:16,940 --> 03:57:19,620
I must fulfill my duty

1417
03:57:19,620 --> 03:57:24,420
I almost just I almost died. I jumped for no reason and it was the only thing that kept me alive

1418
03:57:24,899 --> 03:57:26,899
I actually just died right there

1419
03:57:37,049 --> 03:57:39,049
I must take my leave

1420
03:57:41,590 --> 03:57:43,590
What is the saying?

1421
03:57:43,670 --> 03:57:45,110
fear the blood

1422
03:57:45,110 --> 03:57:46,780
eat the blood

1423
03:57:46,780 --> 03:57:48,780
Drink the old blood

1424
03:57:49,239 --> 03:57:51,239
Uh willem I must go

1425
03:57:54,040 --> 03:57:56,680
No, the great you know, what's cool about um the souls games

1426
03:57:58,309 --> 03:58:01,239
these actors I feel like

1427
03:58:01,239 --> 03:58:05,399
They're they're just so good. There's some I wish I knew who they were

1428
03:58:06,120 --> 03:58:08,840
I feel like I don't know any of the other things that these actors have been in

1429
03:58:12,229 --> 03:58:19,770
I missed an item what I am

1430
03:58:21,180 --> 03:58:25,370
Did I was talking

1431
03:58:25,370 --> 03:58:28,569
Whip that's awesome, but I don't want it. Did I miss an item? I actually did

1432
03:58:29,450 --> 03:58:30,969
Okay, no more talking

1433
03:58:30,969 --> 03:58:35,750
I really missed an item. Whatever. It was a fucking smithereen smone. Whatever it is. It was I don't care

1434
03:58:36,549 --> 03:58:45,540
It was a smithing stone

1435
03:58:45,540 --> 03:58:47,540
Dude, tom brady voices the main character

1436
03:58:53,879 --> 03:58:55,319
Oh, yes elden won

1437
03:58:55,399 --> 03:59:00,120
You never noticed they get really close that when it's like a celebrity that doesn't really like do voice acting or act really

1438
03:59:00,760 --> 03:59:03,799
They're always super close to the microphone and they're just talking loudly

1439
03:59:04,360 --> 03:59:07,319
It's like loud talking is not acting but that's what they do

1440
03:59:10,729 --> 03:59:16,149
Oh my goodness. I can't believe what we're looking at here. No, you're not gonna get that by me

1441
03:59:16,950 --> 03:59:18,950
Loud talking always equals acting

1442
03:59:19,350 --> 03:59:33,129
Okay, I got 8200. Are you guys ready for me to one shot kill?

1443
03:59:33,850 --> 03:59:35,850

1444
03:59:44,729 --> 03:59:50,920
Oh, that's I gotta make sure I have at least one of those every like every 30 minutes or so

1445
03:59:50,920 --> 03:59:54,920
So the editors can make sure they get something funny like a clip like a funny clip or not

1446
03:59:56,280 --> 03:59:58,760
I gotta do like every like 30 minutes. I haven't done it in a while

1447
04:00:03,459 --> 04:00:09,860
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

1448
04:00:09,860 --> 04:00:12,260
Anything else over this way? I'm just checking

1449
04:00:13,139 --> 04:00:15,479
Shut up

1450
04:00:15,479 --> 04:00:17,479
What are you doing over there? Shut up

1451
04:00:27,450 --> 04:00:34,379
Whoa, that's the edge of the world. Oh, I got a somber smithing stone

1452
04:00:34,940 --> 04:00:44,659
Can't go on the horse something over there

1453
04:00:46,739 --> 04:00:54,840
It's

1454
04:00:54,840 --> 04:00:56,840
Crab the huge crab

1455
04:00:56,840 --> 04:00:58,840
in every fucking zone

1456
04:00:59,239 --> 04:01:22,760
But I mean that's not even surprising anymore. It's not even surprising to me anymore. It's so bad. I'm gonna do it

1457
04:01:23,770 --> 04:01:25,370
Why should I do it?

1458
04:01:25,370 --> 04:01:29,020
I don't think I want to do it on camera. So i'll hide

1459
04:01:29,500 --> 04:01:42,549
No, i'm not gonna do it. Fuck

1460
04:01:44,700 --> 04:01:57,639
No, never mind

1461
04:01:57,639 --> 04:01:59,700
Is this gonna kill me?

1462
04:01:59,700 --> 04:02:03,299
Be serious. Will this kill me if I go down? No, I think it might i'm gonna go from the bridge

1463
04:02:07,690 --> 04:02:10,329
Oh those those actors are so goddamn funny

1464
04:02:11,290 --> 04:02:15,819
That was so fun

1465
04:02:15,819 --> 04:02:18,219
I don't I think I want to level up first

1466
04:02:21,450 --> 04:02:34,360
Yeah, let's just kill these guys until we level up. What do these guys give us? It's not very much

1467
04:02:34,920 --> 04:02:55,180
It's not a lot who has some decent amount of souls. It's too much to go die at a boss with

1468
04:02:55,899 --> 04:03:10,739
Because i'll probably die like once choice

1469
04:03:11,059 --> 04:03:19,159
I just need to get some souls here

1470
04:03:20,120 --> 04:03:23,299
Is that an item up there?

1471
04:03:25,799 --> 04:03:36,629
No, all right, you're gonna kill the guy this is literally the easiest boss in the game

1472
04:03:38,649 --> 04:03:42,329
Yeah, but I okay if it don't say that because then if I lose then I look bad

1473
04:03:42,809 --> 04:03:49,579
I'm that i'm not that far. I'm gonna kill the big giant guy

1474
04:04:15,780 --> 04:04:19,049
I don't know, man

1475
04:04:20,760 --> 04:04:29,370
Okay, there's 11 000 I got one of these

1476
04:04:35,129 --> 04:04:36,409

All right, getting there almost there almost there almost there. All right, i'll go kill him. Fine. Jeremy, please the boss is like pinwheel

1478
04:04:46,090 --> 04:04:49,149
Fine, okay, it's pinwheel. The boss is pinwheel

1479
04:04:52,250 --> 04:04:59,239
Fine, i'll go all this for a single level. I'll go get him right now. He's pinwheel. Well, let's show him. Let's show him his boss

1480
04:04:59,879 --> 04:05:04,889
It's literally pinwheel. All right. All right. All right. All right, relax. I'll go get him

1481
04:05:08,700 --> 04:05:11,340
This boss is the easiest boss in the game. Okay, fine

1482
04:05:22,659 --> 04:05:23,840
leonine

1483
04:05:23,840 --> 04:05:49,559
Misbegotten

1484
04:05:49,559 --> 04:05:51,559
I wouldn't call this guy pinwheel

1485
04:05:51,559 --> 04:06:23,750
This guy ain't fucking pinwheel

1486
04:06:24,069 --> 04:07:23,500
This guy ain't fucking pinwheel. This guy's got moves

1487
04:07:24,540 --> 04:07:36,729
Good thing I have like a good. Yeah, i'll get him. It's not that bad

1488
04:07:37,370 --> 04:07:44,629
Like I also I like where where

1489
04:07:45,350 --> 04:07:46,229
those

1490
04:07:46,229 --> 04:07:51,350
Fucking sacred tears. I thought they were down here. All right, relax

1491
04:07:52,229 --> 04:07:57,850
How have I only found one the whole time? I played this game. It's impossible

1492
04:07:58,729 --> 04:08:21,059
All right. Now i'm like trying too hard

1493
04:08:21,219 --> 04:08:51,579
Bump heads bumped into each other. That's weird

1494
04:09:46,659 --> 04:09:48,659
Crafted blade great sword

1495
04:09:55,909 --> 04:09:58,229
What the heck is that?

1496
04:09:59,110 --> 04:10:02,920
strength

1497
04:10:02,920 --> 04:10:11,239
Oh my goodness gracious

1498
04:10:13,670 --> 04:10:20,840
This looks like the shit that you pick out of your leg if you've been when you go into the woods

1499
04:10:21,559 --> 04:10:24,059
The things that like are just attached to your body

1500
04:10:26,920 --> 04:10:44,260
What does it move? Is it a block? That's pretty cool weapon

1501
04:10:44,899 --> 04:10:52,729
Uh, yeah, that guy wasn't that bad. But I mean I i'm obviously probably five plus levels leveled for it

1502
04:10:56,309 --> 04:11:00,549
Look with churches

1503
04:11:00,549 --> 04:11:04,500
I mean church I need to find a church

1504
04:11:05,139 --> 04:11:08,139
I mean

1505
04:11:08,139 --> 04:11:18,549
bro

1506
04:11:18,549 --> 04:11:20,969
Can I just get another one of those?

1507
04:11:20,969 --> 04:11:22,489
All right. Well, that's cool

1508
04:11:22,489 --> 04:11:24,649
That's a really cool fight

1509
04:11:24,649 --> 04:11:29,479
Nothing too. Nothing too fancy schmancy. Just gotta kill them

1510
04:11:30,040 --> 04:11:38,360
Okay, uh, so let's go from here

1511
04:11:40,969 --> 04:11:44,250
Is this a church right here? That looks kind of church ish

1512
04:11:45,459 --> 04:11:47,459
That looks kind of like the top of the church

1513
04:11:47,540 --> 04:11:52,649
Either that or here

1514
04:11:52,649 --> 04:11:55,940
That's not a church

1515
04:11:55,940 --> 04:11:58,659
What where's the church? I'm looking for a church. Is this a church?

1516
04:12:01,430 --> 04:12:06,219
They're marked on the map

1517
04:12:06,219 --> 04:12:07,899
That looks like a church

1518
04:12:07,899 --> 04:12:13,610
This looks like I there's no church here

1519
04:12:14,489 --> 04:12:17,750
It looked like ruins

1520
04:12:17,750 --> 04:12:19,750
This looks like it i'm gonna go to two

1521
04:12:28,100 --> 04:12:30,100
Why does everything look like a church to you?

1522
04:12:33,340 --> 04:12:36,459
Everything doesn't look like a church that I mean like if they're all buildings

1523
04:12:45,700 --> 04:12:47,219
That looks like a church

1524
04:12:47,219 --> 04:12:54,309
We're gonna check it out

1525
04:12:54,309 --> 04:12:57,190
Oh, let me go talk to um, what's that? The the girl?

1526
04:12:58,069 --> 04:13:00,309
I gotta go talk to the girl that I gave the letter

1527
04:13:00,870 --> 04:13:04,420
She's like give this letter to my father. He's right here, right?

1528
04:13:05,059 --> 04:13:06,579
There was she right here

1529
04:13:06,579 --> 04:13:08,200
It was right here somewhere

1530
04:13:08,200 --> 04:13:12,549
Is she at the rampart or was she at the gate?

1531
04:13:12,950 --> 04:13:15,510
Where is she?

1532
04:13:15,510 --> 04:13:19,799
She was back here, right?

1533
04:13:20,760 --> 04:13:23,290
Can you just take a shower?

1534
04:13:23,290 --> 04:13:25,610
Don't tell me when I need to clean. Okay

1535
04:13:26,329 --> 04:13:32,260
I assure you I am very clean

1536
04:13:32,819 --> 04:13:58,739
Do I have to really go to the other one?

1537
04:13:58,739 --> 04:14:17,020
Remember you too stressed out today. I'm fine run and jump. I said I just did that

1538
04:14:17,659 --> 04:14:27,430
She's right here. Where is she? Where is she? Isn't she right here?

1539
04:14:28,069 --> 04:14:41,180
I thought she was sitting like right over here somewhere

1540
04:15:02,299 --> 04:15:04,059
Wait, what?

1541
04:15:04,059 --> 04:15:05,879
She's dead

1542
04:15:05,879 --> 04:15:10,860
You mean she's dead

1543
04:15:10,860 --> 04:15:13,260
Somebody drop a sword on her from up there

1544
04:15:17,690 --> 04:15:19,690
All right. Oops

1545
04:15:25,780 --> 04:15:27,780
I'm gonna be in big fucking trouble

1546
04:15:30,459 --> 04:15:33,260
Frank I was never fucking on the rampart. Please you gotta help me

1547
04:15:37,479 --> 04:15:41,129
uh

1548
04:15:41,129 --> 04:16:03,290
Dad was over here. Dad was like up in the tower up there. She should level up. I will

1549
04:16:03,770 --> 04:16:19,850
Where was the dad up on the I just said my object permanence especially with the game with this 500 million places to go

1550
04:16:20,809 --> 04:16:25,860
Is he was up in one of these that one there? I think he was further in

1551
04:16:26,659 --> 04:16:37,959
so yeah, he was actually like inside the castle and

1552
04:16:39,799 --> 04:16:43,180
Lift I remember him just sitting on top of one of these things

1553
04:16:44,059 --> 04:16:54,329
Here, but like the rampart has a gotta go through and up to the left tower

1554
04:16:56,819 --> 04:17:16,139
Does this go up? I'm not in the castle right now

1555
04:17:17,100 --> 04:17:21,079
I remember doing this and then he's like up in there

1556
04:17:21,719 --> 04:17:23,719
I

1557
04:17:23,719 --> 04:17:26,860
Don't know. I have no idea where he is

1558
04:17:27,260 --> 04:17:32,309
You can't remember the dungeon. He just cleared it. No, dude. I can't because this it's it's so big

1559
04:17:32,469 --> 04:17:34,469
There's so much to see there's so much going on

1560
04:17:35,430 --> 04:17:37,430
I like it's so hard to remember everything

1561
04:17:39,239 --> 04:17:41,319
I have absolutely no idea how to get up there

1562
04:17:44,469 --> 04:17:49,590
Like if you gave me a 100 million dollars right now and said in 10 seconds show me on the map where he is

1563
04:17:50,469 --> 04:17:53,829
I wouldn't be able to do it. I physically wouldn't do it. I wouldn't be able to

1564
04:17:54,790 --> 04:18:04,889
What I should have done is I should have marked where he was

1565
04:18:05,690 --> 04:18:23,129
Because the the thing with the souls games for me and this probably happens to a lot of you guys too

1566
04:18:23,610 --> 04:18:27,209
is you have like an ever moving window of stuff that you know

1567
04:18:28,010 --> 04:18:28,969
and like

1568
04:18:28,969 --> 04:18:33,450
It just keeps moving like this and the and all you can remember and all you can do

1569
04:18:33,930 --> 04:18:37,930
Is the shit in this line here and it moves with you

1570
04:18:38,489 --> 04:18:40,489
So like you'll get through an area

1571
04:18:41,129 --> 04:18:43,129
And like you you start here

1572
04:18:43,129 --> 04:18:48,329
Oh, there he is. He's on top of the fucking rampart. I know where that guy is and then like a half an hour later

1573
04:18:49,290 --> 04:18:53,530
It's like that guy never existed. It's like you can't even go back that far. It's moving with you

1574
04:18:55,930 --> 04:18:58,329
So like now I now I remember where he is

1575
04:18:59,129 --> 04:19:06,629
Now I remember he's up there. I was gonna get them. It's the fastest way to get that this way

1576
04:19:16,340 --> 04:19:18,340
It's like there's an ever moving window

1577
04:19:19,219 --> 04:19:22,100
Of like stuff that I can remember in these games

1578
04:19:24,020 --> 04:19:26,500
Because remember in the back of my mind i'm thinking about like

1579
04:19:27,139 --> 04:19:29,139
All the whiz why do I where's my weapon?

1580
04:19:33,979 --> 04:19:38,139
There's so much other side info in the back of my head that I need to remember

1581
04:19:39,180 --> 04:19:40,540
That's just here

1582
04:19:40,540 --> 04:19:42,540
And they all get mixed up together and putt

1583
04:19:43,020 --> 04:19:56,260
That's what the notepad is for. Well, that's what the markers are for, but i'm not using them

1584
04:19:56,879 --> 04:20:25,260
Effectively. Okay, so he's like here all the way up there you motherfucker. How do I go over there?

1585
04:20:28,870 --> 04:20:30,870
Um, don't die for the love of god, please

1586
04:20:31,829 --> 04:20:57,479
Is he gonna die on here and then up we're good, right? Am I going the right way? There's something else here

1587
04:21:01,430 --> 04:21:10,069
Yeah, I found something else

1588
04:21:15,399 --> 04:21:19,319
Ooh a smithing stone. Okay, so he's like up there

1589
04:21:20,120 --> 04:21:24,420
Is he on this one or is he on the other one?

1590
04:21:26,020 --> 04:21:29,739
No, he's definitely on this one. This is right

1591
04:21:30,700 --> 04:21:41,430
Other way, I never got that item the east corner

1592
04:21:43,219 --> 04:21:45,610
He's like in here

1593
04:21:45,610 --> 04:21:47,610
What would it be at would he be at the fire?

1594
04:21:47,930 --> 04:21:55,930
Is there a ladder that I didn't see?

1595
04:21:55,930 --> 04:21:57,930
Bps needed this is not east

1596
04:21:59,590 --> 04:22:00,870
This is east

1597
04:22:00,870 --> 04:22:09,350
What are you talking about? Not south. I can't I can't go any more east

1598
04:22:10,229 --> 04:22:12,229
There's no more east I can go

1599
04:22:12,469 --> 04:22:17,690
Even here

1600
04:22:17,690 --> 04:22:21,530
He's dead dickheads over there. All right, fucking god. Damn it, man

1601
04:22:22,950 --> 04:22:24,950
I thought he was up in one of those like tower things

1602
04:22:25,510 --> 04:22:39,610
And there's like so many like roundabouts and like ladders you climb and then jump down and then drop down and go around the corner

1603
04:22:40,090 --> 04:22:42,090
It's it's kind of hard to navigate

1604
04:22:47,209 --> 04:22:49,850
There's not just a ladder sitting in front of that it's like

1605
04:22:50,250 --> 04:22:54,409
Go up climb up and then go around that side and then drop down and then go around the rock around the bridge

1606
04:22:54,409 --> 04:22:56,170
And then up and into the right

1607
04:22:56,170 --> 04:23:15,110
I can't just she's dead

1608
04:23:21,180 --> 04:23:23,059
What does that do?

1609
04:23:23,059 --> 04:23:27,319
Kill him. I don't think I want to kill he might show up later

1610
04:23:35,110 --> 04:23:39,120
I'm not gonna kill him now go back to her location

1611
04:23:50,180 --> 04:23:52,180
Freaking 100 million dollars

1612
04:24:18,899 --> 04:24:21,139
I chose duty over my daughter's safety

1613
04:24:22,180 --> 04:24:23,059
and

1614
04:24:23,059 --> 04:24:25,219
That is how fate has answered

1615
04:24:28,219 --> 04:24:31,770
Find them wretched responsible for this

1616
04:24:32,409 --> 04:24:36,329
I'll hunt them down and exterminate every last one of them

1617
04:24:36,969 --> 04:24:38,489
Rest assured

1618
04:24:38,489 --> 04:24:40,790
Arena, it will be done

1619
04:24:43,959 --> 04:24:46,760
Find the foul i'll hunt them down. Rest assured

1620
04:24:47,399 --> 04:24:48,440
Okay

1621
04:24:48,440 --> 04:24:51,129
Oh

1622
04:24:51,450 --> 04:24:59,559
Now what is that that's at the end of his little thing there

1623
04:25:00,200 --> 04:25:02,860
I don't think i'm gonna kill him

1624
04:25:02,860 --> 04:25:04,940
That's it kill him kill

1625
04:25:07,590 --> 04:25:12,459
Why would I kill him?

1626
04:25:12,459 --> 04:25:15,180
He definitely shows up later. Why wouldn't he? No, i'm not killing him

1627
04:25:18,739 --> 04:25:24,500
All right time to go to the church and get my god damn for the first time in history

1628
04:25:25,459 --> 04:25:28,840
A flask level up for the first time in history

1629
04:25:34,360 --> 04:25:35,639
We're going

1630
04:25:35,639 --> 04:26:00,020
to number three

1631
04:26:00,020 --> 04:26:01,860
Up here around the left

1632
04:26:01,860 --> 04:26:06,170
You should have plus four by the time you go back to really

1633
04:26:07,049 --> 04:26:25,850
Enter evergale

1634
04:26:25,850 --> 04:26:27,290
the area

1635
04:26:27,290 --> 04:26:33,500
market

1636
04:26:33,500 --> 04:26:36,620
No, no, no, no go to church. I know hold on

1637
04:26:37,500 --> 04:26:46,579
I lost my marker

1638
04:26:46,579 --> 04:26:49,620
What the fuck is happening with these markers four?

1639
04:26:50,340 --> 04:27:06,600
I feel like i'm gonna die if I drop don't kill me, please

1640
04:27:07,239 --> 04:27:09,620
Okay

1641
04:27:09,620 --> 04:27:15,959
I'm begging you read the map

1642
04:27:18,920 --> 04:27:20,920
That is 2d. It's hard to read this

1643
04:27:21,559 --> 04:27:34,760
Can I even get across there from I don't think I can make it from here. Maybe this way

1644
04:27:45,319 --> 04:27:46,280
Oh

1645
04:27:46,280 --> 04:27:47,620
Let's go

1646
04:27:47,620 --> 04:28:04,889
Hey, it's all good to find a way

1647
04:28:05,129 --> 04:28:14,809
Oh my god

1648
04:28:14,809 --> 04:28:28,340
This was kind of way out of the fucking way. My boys are way cooler

1649
04:28:30,700 --> 04:28:32,069
All right

1650
04:28:32,069 --> 04:28:34,280

mausoleum prowls

1652
04:28:35,559 --> 04:28:37,559
Cradling the soulless demigod

1653
04:28:38,200 --> 04:28:44,840
Purchase pilgrimage

1654
04:28:51,579 --> 04:28:54,940

Add a charge sacred tear. Let's go. Thank you

1658
04:29:11,319 --> 04:29:19,559
Okay

1659
04:29:19,559 --> 04:29:26,250
Uh, that's that church. I see a church right here. Is that a church? I think that's a church

1660
04:29:26,250 --> 04:29:43,610
How do I get over there?

1661
04:29:43,610 --> 04:29:46,979
Any more churches?

1662
04:29:46,979 --> 04:29:48,979
in this direct vicinity

1663
04:29:49,299 --> 04:29:52,569
would be

1664
04:29:52,569 --> 04:29:58,090
I'm gonna investigate these these could be

1665
04:29:58,889 --> 04:30:20,340
Four and five that's definitely a church over there. All right. Hell. Yeah, let's fucking come on man. Can we do this?

1666
04:30:21,139 --> 04:30:30,840
How many seats do I have that I that was my third so I i have zero now

1667
04:30:36,950 --> 04:30:39,989
This is definitely not a church, but that is so i'll have plus three

1668
04:30:42,489 --> 04:30:44,170
back here later

1669
04:30:44,170 --> 04:31:01,690
What is that? What the hell is that?

1670
04:31:09,000 --> 04:31:11,000
I don't I don't want to fuck with that thing right now

1671
04:31:12,120 --> 04:31:17,930
No, not yet, there's no heads

1672
04:31:26,700 --> 04:31:28,700
Give me another flask thing

1673
04:31:29,100 --> 04:31:31,100
This is definitely a church

1674
04:31:34,870 --> 04:31:41,690
Fourth church of marika. Oh, yeah

1675
04:31:53,190 --> 04:31:58,229
Okay, i'm in a much better position now. I played this whole damn game without this. How did I fucking do that?

1676
04:32:03,139 --> 04:32:05,139
Very nice. I'm gonna say

1677
04:32:05,780 --> 04:32:11,420
seven and two

1678
04:32:11,500 --> 04:32:12,459
Uh

1679
04:32:12,459 --> 04:32:17,670
Is there any more?

1680
04:32:17,670 --> 04:32:28,040
What about like here?

1681
04:32:28,040 --> 04:32:29,879
This looks kind of church-like

1682
04:32:29,879 --> 04:32:35,260
Investigate that tree

1683
04:32:37,079 --> 04:32:46,840
on the map

1684
04:32:46,840 --> 04:32:49,159
This do you mean this one? I think I already was over here

1685
04:32:54,280 --> 04:33:13,580
I think I want maybe let me wait and then I need to level up either health or more intelligence. Yeah

1686
04:33:22,459 --> 04:33:24,299
Go to the tower. That's here

1687
04:33:24,299 --> 04:33:41,240
The game just crashed going on you're gonna come back. Oh, it's the last thing that happened

1688
04:33:46,360 --> 04:33:52,340
Hold on if the stream dies, i'll be right back. I hope it doesn't hold on

1689
04:33:59,220 --> 04:34:04,599
Uh, that was weird

1690
04:34:08,459 --> 04:34:23,479
Um, I think i'm okay. I think i'm okay. Yeah, we're good. That was weird

1691
04:34:24,040 --> 04:34:35,299
I spammed the markers so they crashed my game. I'm annoying. Hopefully I didn't lose any progress or anything

1692
04:34:40,409 --> 04:34:45,450
Uh, there's an eldering save conflict. Uh, definitely the one from like 10 five two minutes ago

1693
04:34:46,090 --> 04:34:53,930
My computer's locking up now. What the fuck is going on?

1694
04:34:55,130 --> 04:34:57,130
What the fuck is happening dude?

1695
04:34:58,090 --> 04:34:59,580
I pressed

1696
04:34:59,580 --> 04:35:03,000
Put a marker down five times and then my whole computer's locking up

1697
04:35:07,139 --> 04:35:26,470
Fuck off windows update. No, no, it's just the game just died. Okay. Well, hope I didn't lose any progress

1698
04:35:26,869 --> 04:35:34,380
Let's come back

1699
04:35:34,380 --> 04:35:36,380
I don't think I lost any progress

1700
04:35:37,369 --> 04:35:39,930
Last save was the local file was from a minute ago. So

1701
04:35:40,569 --> 04:35:59,430
Let's hope not

1702
04:35:59,430 --> 04:36:02,860
Yeah, all right. We're fine. That was very odd

1703
04:36:03,580 --> 04:36:16,599
Yeah, I think we're good

1704
04:36:16,599 --> 04:36:18,599
So I needed to go down here

1705
04:36:19,000 --> 04:36:23,029
Okay, i'm gonna do that slower now

1706
04:36:23,270 --> 04:36:30,310
I think I clicked it too fast. So I want to go here

1707
04:36:32,700 --> 04:36:33,740
Maybe here

1708
04:36:33,740 --> 04:36:44,150
Let's go. Oh, it's a little house

1709
04:36:52,819 --> 04:36:54,180
Love love work

1710
04:36:54,180 --> 04:37:03,770
People just hanging out on the beach

1711
04:37:03,770 --> 04:37:05,770
Something in the water. What's that?

1712
04:37:07,830 --> 04:37:18,779
Oh, it's just a tree never mind game's sick

1713
04:37:19,740 --> 04:37:31,750
All right. Who's this person?

1714
04:37:36,889 --> 04:37:39,849
They all have such interesting stuff well, there's a lantern but I don't I don't need it

1715
04:37:40,650 --> 04:37:43,139
Another key. All right. Well, you're cool

1716
04:37:46,139 --> 04:37:53,419
Enjoy your shack

1717
04:37:53,419 --> 04:37:55,419
Okay. So is this a church up here?

1718
04:38:02,869 --> 04:38:09,259
Uh, I have the spell. I don't really need it three crunchies

1719
04:38:15,529 --> 04:38:17,049
three crunchies

1720
04:38:17,049 --> 04:38:18,330
Crunchy spot

1721
04:38:18,330 --> 04:38:29,080
Okay, that's what that is. So then what's this?

1722
04:38:29,400 --> 04:38:42,310
I'm really sorry, but I was afraid that you're gonna all people get me

1723
04:38:43,110 --> 04:38:59,000
All right. Well, it's not over here. I gotta go back up to like land

1724
04:38:59,799 --> 04:39:10,709
I can't like catch it

1725
04:39:10,709 --> 04:39:19,959
There we go. That thing is so weird. I gotta go see what that thing actually does

1726
04:39:43,619 --> 04:39:45,619
Stop bringing the bell. It's annoying me

1727
04:39:46,979 --> 04:39:58,740
All right, what's up here?

1728
04:39:58,740 --> 04:40:07,720
What a guy great dragon fly head

1729
04:40:08,279 --> 04:40:23,369
What do you got? This doesn't look like a church, but there's something here

1730
04:40:24,090 --> 04:40:25,930
our return

1731
04:40:30,020 --> 04:40:38,009
Climb you get to play the king's field games

1732
04:40:38,810 --> 04:40:40,650
No, not a chance

1733
04:40:40,650 --> 04:40:41,849
not a chance

1734
04:40:41,849 --> 04:40:44,810
I've seen gameplay of king's field and

1735
04:40:45,529 --> 04:40:48,090
It just looks I could I don't think I could do it

1736
04:40:48,810 --> 04:40:57,369
It seems like uh, what's that first person?

1737
04:40:58,009 --> 04:41:01,209
rpg game

1738
04:41:01,290 --> 04:41:05,529
It's a first person rpg. That's really really strange

1739
04:41:08,229 --> 04:41:14,330
Nope, actually, let's do it. Wait

1740
04:41:15,610 --> 04:41:26,540
Wait, nothing in there

1741
04:41:26,860 --> 04:41:44,569
I go i'm just gonna go i'm curious where it takes me lindell royal capital

1742
04:41:48,150 --> 04:41:58,389
Dear okay. Well, uh, okay. Where am I?

1743
04:42:08,459 --> 04:42:10,459
Somebody lying down

1744
04:42:10,860 --> 04:42:27,880
Oh, yeah, you're gonna get up obviously

1745
04:42:28,360 --> 04:42:31,110
There's a chest over there

1746
04:42:31,189 --> 04:42:55,880
stagger him

1747
04:42:55,880 --> 04:42:57,159
Jesus

1748
04:42:57,159 --> 04:43:16,520
Stop trying to squash me. Oh my god

1749
04:43:17,319 --> 04:43:31,509
This early end game area. Oh fuck I can beat this guy. Let me kill this guy

1750
04:43:31,509 --> 04:43:53,770
He probably drops like 20 000 souls. He's gonna fall off

1751
04:43:55,049 --> 04:43:56,090
I can't

1752
04:43:56,090 --> 04:43:57,880
I don't

1753
04:43:57,880 --> 04:43:59,880
He's gonna is he gonna fall?

1754
04:44:00,459 --> 04:44:02,860
Who falls first here? I don't know. Okay. Can he fall?

1755
04:44:03,900 --> 04:44:13,610
I don't think he can touch as I want him to

1756
04:44:28,569 --> 04:45:00,740
All right still not enough

1757
04:45:17,290 --> 04:45:30,259
Whoa, I didn't get it. I thought I staggered him I get it

1758
04:45:32,009 --> 04:45:34,009
Nope, I thought he was falling down. I'm good

1759
04:45:34,979 --> 04:45:38,340
I every time it goes like oh down to one knee. I keep I think i'm staggering you

1760
04:45:39,060 --> 04:45:54,779
Your face is red

1761
04:45:54,779 --> 04:45:57,020
I'm gonna try this one more time. I'm not supposed to be here. So i'm gonna leave

1762
04:45:57,819 --> 04:46:17,819
But I feel like I can do it. Fuck you, buddy

1763
04:46:22,099 --> 04:46:25,299
Yeah, fuck off. I'm taking you a freaking free shit

1764
04:46:26,259 --> 04:46:49,860
Thank you. Thanks for the talisman. I'm not supposed to be here. It don't matter

1765
04:47:02,540 --> 04:47:08,819
I'm i'm out. I got the item. I got the item. I'm not supposed to be here

1766
04:47:09,700 --> 04:47:17,939
There's a dead end mini boss

1767
04:47:17,939 --> 04:47:19,939
There's a portal on the other side

1768
04:47:21,619 --> 04:47:25,959
Does he actually drop anything?

1769
04:47:25,959 --> 04:47:27,959
I mean, I know this isn't a boss

1770
04:47:29,779 --> 04:47:31,779
These enemies that are like as big as the whole screen

1771
04:47:32,259 --> 04:47:34,259
It's just so hard to tell when they're gonna swing it

1772
04:48:02,439 --> 04:48:03,799
I'll get him

1773
04:48:03,799 --> 04:48:09,369
He's gonna stop being greedy hit him twice and run away. Otherwise, you physically cannot see what he's doing

1774
04:48:17,939 --> 04:48:21,139
They fall over. Yeah that but I need to do more damage

1775
04:48:22,919 --> 04:48:25,560
You got this tomato boy, shut up

1776
04:49:42,549 --> 04:49:47,540
I knew that was gonna happen

1777
04:49:50,970 --> 04:49:54,549
He was just too close to the edge. I thought he was gonna do the thing where he pulls up

1778
04:49:55,029 --> 04:50:03,740
Maybe i'll try jump attacking

1779
04:50:03,740 --> 04:50:19,099
I feel like I won't hit him in the ankle though

1780
04:50:19,099 --> 04:50:23,259
What actually worked?

1781
04:50:24,060 --> 04:50:31,130
I did that two times

1782
04:50:31,130 --> 04:50:47,720
That staggers that much. Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me, dude?

1783
04:50:48,919 --> 04:50:53,209
I don't stagger that much

1784
04:50:57,610 --> 04:51:19,299
Just made that not even a problem holy shit

1785
04:51:20,259 --> 04:51:23,659
Oh my goodness, okay. Well

1786
04:51:24,139 --> 04:51:29,430
That's one way I had to do that

1787
04:51:29,430 --> 04:51:32,630
That's more stagger than a fully charged right trigger

1788
04:51:33,430 --> 04:51:44,380
Well, there was no point in that but it was fun

1789
04:51:45,020 --> 04:51:48,599
All right. What was the talisman?

1790
04:51:50,470 --> 04:51:52,709
Slowly restores hp by how much?

1791
04:51:53,349 --> 04:52:10,869
I think I want that that's cool. All right. What was what was I doing? I was trying to get more flasks, right?

1792
04:52:11,590 --> 04:52:26,090
I think cool. Okay

1793
04:52:26,729 --> 04:52:29,529
I have a few options

1794
04:52:29,529 --> 04:52:31,830
option one

1795
04:52:31,830 --> 04:52:33,830
Go kill this goddamn dragon

1796
04:52:35,459 --> 04:52:37,450
option two

1797
04:52:37,450 --> 04:52:42,090
Go finish whatever's going on and carry a manor because I think I didn't complete it all

1798
04:52:44,250 --> 04:52:46,580
uh

1799
04:52:46,580 --> 04:52:48,580
option four

1800
04:52:50,840 --> 04:52:57,189
Head down here

1801
04:52:57,189 --> 04:52:58,790
Big tree, please

1802
04:52:58,790 --> 04:53:20,860
All right option five. I'll go to big tree. All right, big tree is at number one. Let's go

1803
04:53:21,419 --> 04:53:29,540
I wonder if I should mess around with this too

1804
04:53:36,979 --> 04:53:39,220
Oh, there it is the tower

1805
04:53:39,220 --> 04:53:41,779
Finally can return to our home bathed in rays of gold

1806
04:53:49,400 --> 04:53:54,549
I'm getting my revenge

1807
04:53:54,549 --> 04:53:57,110
No, the person said go to the okay. I'm gonna go to the tree

1808
04:53:58,340 --> 04:54:01,220
I'm gonna go to the tree. I'm gonna go to the tree. I'm gonna go to the tree

1809
04:54:01,380 --> 04:54:03,779
That person that just said dude go to the tree just almost flipped out

1810
04:54:05,450 --> 04:54:23,799
I'm going to the tree

1811
04:54:23,799 --> 04:54:27,479
Do the bell do the bell. I gotta do the tree before I gotta do the tree first

1812
04:54:27,959 --> 04:54:30,439
Don't go. I need to do the tree first. Trust me

1813
04:54:31,240 --> 04:54:33,959
I'm a i'm not a doctor. I don't want to say that. That's that's fake

1814
04:54:34,759 --> 04:54:37,479
I don't want somebody to be like, oh dude, what happened? What do you think about my bike?

1815
04:54:37,799 --> 04:54:39,959
The I got this like pimple on my back. I don't care

1816
04:54:42,150 --> 04:54:44,599
All right. I'm here

1817
04:54:44,599 --> 04:54:45,799
What's here?

1818
04:54:45,799 --> 04:54:50,380
What do we got? Minor urd tree

1819
04:54:51,020 --> 04:55:06,409
What do we got?

1820
04:55:06,409 --> 04:55:22,259
singing

1821
04:55:22,259 --> 04:55:42,569
What's here? There's nothing here. At least not that I can see

1822
04:55:55,669 --> 04:55:58,150
Is a go to the pots something on the pots

1823
04:55:59,029 --> 04:56:05,450
It's like a time of day thing

1824
04:56:05,450 --> 04:56:13,770
Who's that? Oh, this person's singing

1825
04:56:15,110 --> 04:56:18,819
urd tree avatar

1826
04:56:18,819 --> 04:56:22,340
Okay, let's go

1827
04:56:22,580 --> 04:56:24,099
The caster

1828
04:56:24,099 --> 04:56:39,979
It's like a tree trunk

1829
04:56:39,979 --> 04:56:53,099
This boss is kind of cool

1830
04:56:53,180 --> 04:57:10,580
Not bad. I see. Oh my god. Stop talking

1831
04:57:12,259 --> 04:57:15,720
Gerva stop talking

1832
04:57:16,900 --> 04:58:00,540
Stop talking

1833
04:58:00,540 --> 04:58:02,540
Line aside. Haha, stupid

1834
04:58:22,860 --> 04:58:29,459
Got it. He knows chat will make fun of him if we use magic

1835
04:58:30,020 --> 04:58:34,299
Okay, so that was

1836
04:58:34,360 --> 04:58:38,779
Opalene bubble tear and crimson burst crystal tear

1837
04:58:42,259 --> 04:58:42,979
Oh

1838
04:58:42,979 --> 04:58:45,299
That was worse than the boss. That was scary than the boss

1839
04:58:46,020 --> 04:58:48,360
Thank you game. Oh my god

1840
04:58:49,400 --> 04:58:54,299
okay

1841
04:58:54,299 --> 04:58:59,029
enhances charge attacks for

1842
04:59:00,009 --> 04:59:02,650
set sadly reduces hp

1843
04:59:04,970 --> 04:59:07,849
Significantly negates damage in mixed physique. What do these do?

1844
04:59:08,569 --> 04:59:14,779
What do these do?

1845
04:59:14,779 --> 04:59:16,779
flask of wondrous physique

1846
04:59:16,779 --> 04:59:24,139
I need a I still need the flask. I don't have

1847
04:59:24,860 --> 04:59:28,180
You can make potions with them. Oh cool. Okay

1848
04:59:28,979 --> 04:59:30,819
That was cool

1849
04:59:30,819 --> 04:59:34,419
All right. Now I gotta go to the tree you go to the tree cool. Okay, so now

1850
04:59:35,220 --> 04:59:39,380
That was pretty cool fight

1851
04:59:39,380 --> 04:59:42,259
It's time for I gotta get my revenge. I have to get my revenge

1852
04:59:42,419 --> 04:59:54,409
I have to kill this fucking dragon before I lose my mind back off the horse

1853
05:00:03,459 --> 05:00:05,459
All right, don't get one hit killed

1854
05:00:07,099 --> 05:00:08,459
This is it

1855
05:00:08,459 --> 05:00:17,720
I'm coming in here with knowledge with more flasks. I'm ready

1856
05:00:18,680 --> 05:00:23,000
I have three attempts. We're not angry. We're having a good time together

1857
05:00:23,159 --> 05:00:25,159
You and me are hanging out here

1858
05:00:34,459 --> 05:03:00,759
Got a little greedy. I thought I was gonna be able to sprint away from it

1859
05:03:01,319 --> 05:03:04,330
I thought I was gonna be able to sprint through

1860
05:03:06,819 --> 05:03:11,139
God damn man. That fucking insta kill is kind of horseshit if i'm honest

1861
05:03:12,500 --> 05:03:14,819
I was trying to do this like just sprint away from it

1862
05:03:15,540 --> 05:03:24,490
Okay, so I can't sprint. I can't jump because jumping i'll hit his body when he lands and instantly kills you

1863
05:03:28,919 --> 05:03:30,439
You game what?

1864
05:03:30,439 --> 05:03:38,869
Because when he like when he comes down, I wonder

1865
05:03:39,590 --> 05:03:42,729
Instead of running sideways run like forward

1866
05:03:43,529 --> 05:03:57,990
Okay, i'm stuck in his body

1867
05:03:57,990 --> 05:05:09,340
It's bad. All right. Here we go. Here we go

1868
05:05:09,580 --> 05:05:11,580
Forward straight straight straight straight

1869
05:05:11,659 --> 05:05:55,979
God, that's plain. Where'd you go? Don't be greedy. I'm gonna try not to i'm not gonna be greedy

1870
05:06:04,700 --> 05:06:07,180
Didn't fucking work that time. I was running straight

1871
05:06:07,979 --> 05:06:10,979
Just got lucky and went right between his legs

1872
05:06:30,840 --> 05:07:17,319
bad

1873
05:07:17,319 --> 05:07:23,400
No, don't do that again

1874
05:07:23,479 --> 05:07:25,560
Someone invade him. I'm not playing online

1875
05:07:26,360 --> 05:07:28,040
I'm not getting invaded

1876
05:07:28,040 --> 05:09:53,779
Get stamina stamina stamina. I'm such a coward. I'm too afraid

1877
05:10:18,490 --> 05:10:42,169
Don't freak out. It's bugs all over my fucking body

1878
05:11:35,000 --> 05:11:42,150
Oh, man

1879
05:11:42,150 --> 05:11:43,450
Get out of here

1880
05:11:43,450 --> 05:11:46,729
God that was fucking horrible. That wasn't even that bad. It was just smart

1881
05:11:47,450 --> 05:11:50,490
What did I drop?

1882
05:11:50,490 --> 05:11:52,700
The dragon heart?

1883
05:11:52,700 --> 05:11:56,700
Neutriconic power is available. Let's go

1884
05:11:57,419 --> 05:12:12,150
Let's go

1885
05:12:12,150 --> 05:12:14,389
Do you're pursing your lips so much they're turning purple

1886
05:12:15,189 --> 05:12:22,599
I'll get some blood back into it

1887
05:12:22,599 --> 05:12:24,919
It looks like i've been drinking wine for like four hours

1888
05:12:25,639 --> 05:12:42,090
The item dropped an item you look cold. I'm not cold. I'm actually burning up

1889
05:12:42,970 --> 05:12:59,430
Description is nonsense. Okay. Okay, all right. We cleaned up a little bit

1890
05:12:59,990 --> 05:13:03,509
I'm gonna level up and then I think it's time

1891
05:13:04,549 --> 05:13:11,369
It might be time. It was an item at your feet. Was there actually?

1892
05:13:12,250 --> 05:13:16,599
I mean, this is where I killed him. I don't see one

1893
05:13:17,689 --> 05:13:26,900
item item item item

1894
05:13:27,060 --> 05:13:28,939
We're

1895
05:13:28,939 --> 05:13:32,139
Dragon item. I mean I picked it up didn't I I don't see it on the ground

1896
05:13:33,299 --> 05:13:40,889

1897
05:13:40,889 --> 05:13:43,799
I just bait or are you guys serious?

1898
05:13:44,439 --> 05:13:47,909
I killed him right here

1899
05:13:47,909 --> 05:13:51,240
That's great

1900
05:13:51,240 --> 05:13:56,709
Okay, so now

1901
05:13:56,709 --> 05:14:10,139
That tied up that loose end. I'm just trying to tie up some loose ends. What time is it? What just happened?

1902
05:14:10,619 --> 05:14:24,759
That's fine. Okay, go back to where he spawned. Uh, I already got that item. I

1903
05:14:25,319 --> 05:14:27,319
I got that a long time ago

1904
05:14:30,790 --> 05:14:36,860
I mean somebody here. I already got this

1905
05:14:37,500 --> 05:14:43,060
Okay. So now i'm what i'm gonna do

1906
05:14:43,779 --> 05:14:45,779

1907
05:14:45,860 --> 05:14:48,259

1908
05:14:48,740 --> 05:14:50,500
Chill the heck out

1909
05:14:50,500 --> 05:14:52,020
i'm gonna level up

1910
05:14:52,020 --> 05:14:55,220
And i'm gonna try this guy

1911
05:14:55,220 --> 05:15:09,189
Two more times just two more times. I just want to try them two more times. That's it. I promise only two times

1912
05:15:09,990 --> 05:15:34,919
I'm only gonna try them two times. Oh upgrade. Oh look, uh, I can't really use them here anyways, but

1913
05:15:35,720 --> 05:15:39,430
How many souls do I actually have?

1914
05:15:39,590 --> 05:15:42,090
Okay, I have a lot

1915
05:15:47,979 --> 05:15:52,299
I spent all yesterday trying to beat him, but we got it done. All right, I gotta get him done

1916
05:15:53,319 --> 05:15:55,319
No more complaining

1917
05:15:55,319 --> 05:15:57,159
No complaints just

1918
05:15:57,159 --> 05:16:03,380
Beat him. I will go upgrade what I can upgrade and i'm gonna buy

1919
05:16:05,419 --> 05:16:06,709
Yeah

1920
05:16:06,709 --> 05:16:08,229
Yeah, okay

1921
05:16:08,229 --> 05:16:27,099
Give me a sec. So can I did I get anything else to upgrade? I kind of want to upgrade this other step

1922
05:16:31,930 --> 05:16:34,490
You need like 40 vigor to not get one shot

1923
05:16:35,130 --> 05:16:39,099
I feel like my health is kind of low. Maybe I should start focusing on it

1924
05:16:41,020 --> 05:16:50,950
I feel like i'm too spread out

1925
05:16:50,950 --> 05:17:03,110
Okay, i'm gonna use this eventually so i'm gonna level it up got a

1926
05:17:03,650 --> 05:17:06,470
Intelligence scaling i'm gonna get i'm gonna use this staff eventually

1927
05:17:07,029 --> 05:17:14,659
In fact, let me see what it is now. I think I can use it get the physique flask

1928
05:17:15,139 --> 05:17:26,599
Maybe i'll go check out that new dragon power

1929
05:17:31,479 --> 05:17:43,950
Maybe let me do my dumb shit first. Okay, i'm gonna buy this

1930
05:17:46,939 --> 05:17:51,099
I'm gonna buy that because i'm gonna use it and I can justify using it

1931
05:17:51,740 --> 05:17:56,700
Because I just bought it

1932
05:17:56,700 --> 05:17:58,700
Get the special flask

1933
05:17:58,939 --> 05:18:00,380
Somebody said it sucks

1934
05:18:00,380 --> 05:18:04,180
Because I so I just purchased that so i'm gonna turn it on

1935
05:18:08,740 --> 05:18:12,490
Where is it? So I have this one on

1936
05:18:13,049 --> 05:18:16,520
So let me activate it. I got 30 intelligence 25 decks

1937
05:18:17,060 --> 05:18:23,849
2020 let's see what happens. How do I use it? Here we go

1938
05:18:27,060 --> 05:18:36,759
Okay

1939
05:18:36,759 --> 05:18:38,759
35 intelligence

1940
05:18:39,159 --> 05:18:41,159
It's five plus five to everything

1941
05:18:44,490 --> 05:18:45,689
Okay

1942
05:18:45,689 --> 05:18:47,689
All right. All right. All right

1943
05:18:47,689 --> 05:18:50,020
um

1944
05:18:50,020 --> 05:18:52,020
I die though is a huge problem

1945
05:18:52,580 --> 05:18:59,580
That's a huge problem if I die should I even fight the boss?

1946
05:19:00,380 --> 05:19:05,740
I feel like I should not do that now and just do something else

1947
05:19:06,549 --> 05:19:17,189
All right. Here's what i'm gonna do

1948
05:19:17,189 --> 05:19:18,549
i'm gonna go

1949
05:19:18,549 --> 05:19:23,080
This way like here

1950
05:19:23,319 --> 05:19:26,860
either that

1951
05:19:26,860 --> 05:19:28,860
Or um, why is it still pointing down here?

1952
05:19:29,659 --> 05:19:31,900
This tree go to the earth tree

1953
05:19:34,220 --> 05:19:36,220
All right. What do you think?

1954
05:19:37,080 --> 05:19:40,180
up

1955
05:19:40,180 --> 05:19:41,779
south west

1956
05:19:41,779 --> 05:19:46,950
or north

1957
05:19:46,950 --> 05:19:47,830
flask

1958
05:19:47,830 --> 05:19:52,439
I don't want the flask

1959
05:19:52,439 --> 05:19:57,619
up three

1960
05:19:57,619 --> 05:19:59,220
Please get the flask

1961
05:19:59,220 --> 05:20:03,619
Drew, please. All right, just so chat stops yelling at me. Where's this flask?

1962
05:20:04,340 --> 05:20:11,509
They're going to get and stop screaming at me

1963
05:20:14,310 --> 05:20:16,409
It's where the

1964
05:20:16,409 --> 05:20:18,409
Port hate which was here

1965
05:20:19,659 --> 05:20:21,180
What here?

1966
05:20:21,180 --> 05:20:26,919
I'm not screaming

1967
05:20:27,639 --> 05:20:29,240
It's on the ship

1968
05:20:29,319 --> 05:20:31,380
In this ship right here

1969
05:20:31,380 --> 05:20:34,900
North of the mist wood like up here

1970
05:20:36,459 --> 05:20:38,459
here

1971
05:20:38,459 --> 05:20:42,869
Above the mist wood urn tree like somewhere like around here

1972
05:20:44,150 --> 05:20:49,290
I guess

1973
05:20:49,290 --> 05:20:51,430
Say that

1974
05:20:51,430 --> 05:20:53,799
All right, let's go there

1975
05:21:02,939 --> 05:21:07,479
That one is number five

1976
05:21:10,919 --> 05:21:15,110
Okay, you really need it. You'll be really glad that you got it

1977
05:21:15,830 --> 05:21:28,919
I'll give it a go

1978
05:21:28,919 --> 05:21:30,919
So this flask if I drink out of this

1979
05:21:32,900 --> 05:21:34,180
does it

1980
05:21:34,180 --> 05:21:37,580
Does it consume that little bubble?

1981
05:21:37,659 --> 05:21:40,860
Is it just a one and done or is it something I can just put on whenever I feel like it?

1982
05:21:41,580 --> 05:21:49,340
Sure punishes. Okay

1983
05:21:49,340 --> 05:21:51,340
Oh wait, this is also a church

1984
05:21:51,500 --> 05:21:53,500
I wonder if this is a sacred tier here as well

1985
05:21:55,479 --> 05:21:57,479
Oh, thank goodness. Okay good

1986
05:22:00,779 --> 05:22:02,779
and

1987
05:22:02,779 --> 05:22:09,099
Flask of wondrous physique you can find crystal tears at the basis of minor urn trees and elsewhere through the lands between

1988
05:22:10,060 --> 05:22:16,900
The size of grace you can mix two crystal tears in the flask of wondrous physique this will allow you to create elixirs the various custom effects

1989
05:22:18,099 --> 05:22:20,299
Okay

1990
05:22:20,299 --> 05:22:30,599
I mean he did all this without that. Yeah, dude. I don't know. I didn't I this this area this game is fucking huge

1991
05:22:30,759 --> 05:22:33,159
Uh, I I don't I didn't go to the one church

1992
05:22:33,799 --> 05:22:37,000
That had that I don't know. I've just been fucking run around

1993
05:22:37,799 --> 05:22:39,080
Don't get angry

1994
05:22:39,080 --> 05:22:51,689
Okay. So now what?

1995
05:22:51,689 --> 05:22:53,689
Mix wondrous physique

1996
05:22:53,770 --> 05:23:00,490
Restores half of total hp

1997
05:23:03,610 --> 05:23:07,799
Really boosts stamina significantly negates damage

1998
05:23:09,220 --> 05:23:11,209
damage and

1999
05:23:11,209 --> 05:23:12,580
and

2000
05:23:12,580 --> 05:23:17,450
stamina or damage and

2001
05:23:17,930 --> 05:23:18,889
um

2002
05:23:18,889 --> 05:23:23,909
damage and healing it's a one-time use

2003
05:23:26,470 --> 05:23:28,470
Bubble is basically a free hit

2004
05:23:33,159 --> 05:23:34,759
I would probably say

2005
05:23:34,759 --> 05:23:38,099
I don't know stamina is pretty big too, though

2006
05:23:40,409 --> 05:23:43,290
Healing over time is good. But stamina is also

2007
05:23:46,200 --> 05:23:49,319
I'm doing that. I'm doing I can take a hit and I have stamina

2008
05:23:50,119 --> 05:23:51,720
All right, go ahead and make it

2009
05:23:51,720 --> 05:23:57,750
work

2010
05:23:57,750 --> 05:23:59,669
so now

2011
05:23:59,669 --> 05:24:01,669
You can use it one time per death

2012
05:24:04,580 --> 05:24:05,979
What?

2013
05:24:05,979 --> 05:24:11,619
What?

2014
05:24:11,619 --> 05:24:20,979
What?

2015
05:24:20,979 --> 05:24:25,060
That's insane. So I can take a free hit and my stamina regenerates

2016
05:24:25,779 --> 05:24:28,540
It acts like a normal flask

2017
05:24:29,880 --> 05:24:31,880
No wonder everybody was screaming at me

2018
05:24:35,849 --> 05:24:37,849
Okay. Well, I got what I wanted

2019
05:24:38,250 --> 05:24:40,549
It's time to now decide

2020
05:24:40,709 --> 05:24:43,979
Do I want to try this guy?

2021
05:24:44,060 --> 05:24:46,540
again and get frustrated or do I

2022
05:24:47,340 --> 05:24:49,340
Get no i'll get killed and lose the buff

2023
05:24:49,659 --> 05:25:13,619
I'll go up from here

2024
05:25:13,619 --> 05:25:15,930
I'll check out this part this this place

2025
05:25:28,439 --> 05:25:39,900
I'm just gonna i'm gonna just ride in this direction and there's a big thing over there. Let's go that way

2026
05:25:50,040 --> 05:25:56,040
There's that area there. So what's over that? That's the I know that okay, but what about here?

2027
05:25:57,479 --> 05:25:59,779
I want to go like this way

2028
05:26:00,180 --> 05:26:06,229
Let me mark some stuff

2029
05:26:06,229 --> 05:26:15,799
Can I cross this?

2030
05:26:15,799 --> 05:26:17,560
I wonder I don't know

2031
05:26:17,560 --> 05:26:18,599
I don't

2032
05:26:20,419 --> 05:26:38,439
Okay, there's a bunch of these things down here

2033
05:26:39,159 --> 05:26:45,799
I wonder should I kill this thing? I feel like that that might be a bad thing

2034
05:26:46,520 --> 05:26:57,689
We're going that way. Is it safe to get anywhere from here? I think so

2035
05:27:00,330 --> 05:27:03,139
ah

2036
05:27:07,479 --> 05:27:18,919
Can I make that jump that's beautiful. Yeah, it's a beautiful view

2037
05:27:23,529 --> 05:27:49,990
What about over here very clearly is that death probably probably

2038
05:27:49,990 --> 05:27:56,250
Reliably

2039
05:27:56,569 --> 05:28:07,209
Okay, so how do I get down there reliably it has to be a way to get down there my buff

2040
05:28:28,139 --> 05:28:35,270
That sucks

2041
05:28:35,270 --> 05:28:38,220
Good thing at least I bought it

2042
05:28:38,220 --> 05:28:39,819
That's why I can never use that fucking thing

2043
05:28:39,819 --> 05:28:43,099
I never used humanities either because I would use them and just die in five seconds

2044
05:28:43,500 --> 05:28:47,740
Because I would just forget I turned it on or it would just be like I would fall off a building or something like

2045
05:28:47,740 --> 05:28:49,099
That's why I don't ever use them

2046
05:28:49,099 --> 05:28:52,939
I would use them for bosses like if I was about to fight a boss I would turn I would use the community

2047
05:28:56,900 --> 05:29:00,419
But uh, oh it turned on the humanity and then I would just like I would like answer the phone

2048
05:29:01,139 --> 05:29:04,500
Or I would like put a fucking cheeto in my mouth and forget everything and then just walk off the building

2049
05:29:06,779 --> 05:29:10,840
So I can't go that way

2050
05:29:10,840 --> 05:29:13,930
So how can I go out here?

2051
05:29:16,180 --> 05:29:19,139
I'm imagine i'm gonna okay i'm gonna go from here and i'm gonna go that way

2052
05:29:19,860 --> 05:29:26,459
See what I see this does what about the seal?

2053
05:29:27,740 --> 05:29:29,110
Wait

2054
05:29:29,110 --> 05:29:37,189
Wasn't that just to go back to the wasn't that just to go back to the academy? Isn't the seal to go back to the academy?

2055
05:29:38,860 --> 05:29:49,900
I already did the academy. Was it where was it? There were two seals

2056
05:29:50,459 --> 05:29:52,939
Oh, that's right. I walked up to one and it was like, sorry

2057
05:29:56,009 --> 05:29:57,819
wait

2058
05:29:57,819 --> 05:29:59,819
Telling me that I could literally just

2059
05:30:04,389 --> 05:30:06,389
I'm gonna appear at the end of the bridge aren't I?

2060
05:30:25,930 --> 05:30:27,930
Read my palm

2061
05:30:47,080 --> 05:30:49,080
And lift ahead

2062
05:30:51,740 --> 05:30:53,669
Or

2063
05:30:53,669 --> 05:30:58,389
Are you planning to throw this lady could be replaced with a wooden sign?

2064
05:31:08,340 --> 05:31:10,340
Okay, so this is a whole new area

2065
05:31:10,419 --> 05:31:31,270
Let's see how this plays out

2066
05:31:31,270 --> 05:31:37,610
All right. There's these knights here

2067
05:31:38,409 --> 05:31:42,549
Oh, he's beefy

2068
05:31:42,549 --> 05:32:21,380
I'm using the fucking tree

2069
05:32:21,380 --> 05:32:22,500
That hurts

2070
05:32:22,500 --> 05:32:43,979
This dude is definitely a milk drinker. It'd be me

2071
05:32:44,380 --> 05:32:51,450
I mean milk drinker. I don't I don't drink milk, man

2072
05:32:52,250 --> 05:33:08,919
That's I was just triangulated. I was literally triangulated

2073
05:33:10,020 --> 05:33:12,259
One, two, three, I couldn't fucking go anywhere

2074
05:33:15,659 --> 05:33:18,220
They like did I was like a fucking

2075
05:33:18,939 --> 05:33:30,150
Dirt hole trying to dig into a rock and animal crossing. Where even am I? Oh, fuck you really

2076
05:33:40,540 --> 05:33:49,220
All right. Yeah, we're bringing out oleg and not summon anybody here

2077
05:33:50,970 --> 05:33:52,970
Well, also I have a question

2078
05:33:53,799 --> 05:33:57,880
What is the criteria for summoning people? I feel like it's just like fucking random

2079
05:33:58,599 --> 05:34:02,200
What when can you summon when can I how come I can't summon people?

2080
05:34:02,759 --> 05:34:05,959
I feel like it's like oh, it's grayed out. Why why?

2081
05:34:06,759 --> 05:34:13,180
Has anybody figured that out yet?

2082
05:34:13,180 --> 05:34:15,740
Because there's a boss or a statue nearby really

2083
05:34:17,939 --> 05:34:53,270
What you're fucking kidding me, dude

2084
05:34:53,270 --> 05:34:59,740
Oh

2085
05:35:08,599 --> 05:35:13,529
Yeah, i'm talking about these I feel like this is just like kind of random times when you can't summon them

2086
05:35:17,419 --> 05:35:19,419
Kind of figure that that means

2087
05:35:21,509 --> 05:35:25,430
Okay, let's do this. This is what I wanted to do before before I got rudely interrupted

2088
05:35:26,709 --> 05:35:54,599
Fuck off already

2089
05:35:56,220 --> 05:36:15,779
Old man just sit on the ledge. I gotta get down. It's too hard to fight on the horse back here. I gotta just fight

2090
05:36:16,580 --> 05:36:54,439
I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't have any stamina. He broke it

2091
05:37:04,659 --> 05:37:07,799
Tried to jump inside

2092
05:37:11,580 --> 05:37:13,580
So wet

2093
05:37:15,349 --> 05:37:25,259
Like literally it's like I dumped my hand in the fucking sink like literally my hands are covered in fucking water

2094
05:37:29,849 --> 05:37:35,639
Jesus christ

2095
05:37:35,639 --> 05:37:38,200
There's a little stone spire nearby you can summon

2096
05:37:39,240 --> 05:37:42,380
There's a boss here

2097
05:37:43,180 --> 05:37:55,930
This is actually one of the only games where I would wear those like fingerless gamer gloves, you know

2098
05:37:55,930 --> 05:37:58,970
I mean the like biker. I want I want biker gloves

2099
05:37:59,610 --> 05:38:07,369
I'm gonna get them for next time

2100
05:38:07,369 --> 05:38:12,409
Like it would be embarrassing for me to shake somebody's hand right now. I would have to if it was no

2101
05:38:12,409 --> 05:38:15,049
No, no shake my hand right now jerma. It'd be like

2102
05:38:15,689 --> 05:38:22,779
I wouldn't do it

2103
05:38:22,779 --> 05:38:42,229
Racing gloves. Yeah

2104
05:38:42,229 --> 05:38:45,669
Is there anything on the it's not one of those map things I can get here, right?

2105
05:38:46,150 --> 05:39:02,520
Oh

2106
05:39:07,319 --> 05:39:23,509
Yep, yep, we found the the moon katana yet. I have not

2107
05:39:26,169 --> 05:39:38,580
We're gonna just keep going this way

2108
05:39:39,220 --> 05:39:51,060
I guess

2109
05:39:51,060 --> 05:40:00,549
dear any trouble we got

2110
05:40:01,590 --> 05:40:07,159
charm a pierced enemy or

2111
05:40:08,119 --> 05:40:17,080
You don't get very but you got a cool bow focus immunity now

2112
05:40:19,340 --> 05:40:25,110
I'll mark it because I should probably mark all these guys anyways

2113
05:40:27,540 --> 05:40:30,020
That's the merchant house, right? That's what i've been saying

2114
05:40:35,700 --> 05:41:04,229
Uh, okay. Yeah marking the merchants a good idea. Yeah

2115
05:41:05,110 --> 05:41:14,700
Okay, i'm gonna parry this fucking guy and i'm gonna stop being an embarrassing video game player

2116
05:41:16,939 --> 05:41:18,459
That begins now

2117
05:41:18,459 --> 05:41:29,799
Let's not parry on this

2118
05:41:29,799 --> 05:41:56,860
What else is down here? I gotta find a map fragment or something

2119
05:41:57,580 --> 05:42:12,020
Are you gonna cast a spell?

2120
05:42:12,020 --> 05:42:18,520
I feel like a lot of people are resistant to magic in this game. I feel like i'm running into all the places where they are

2121
05:42:20,360 --> 05:42:22,540
But i've been i've happened

2122
05:42:23,340 --> 05:42:36,540
I mean my weapon is intelligence. That's like the whole point right a little hut

2123
05:42:40,169 --> 05:42:41,909
All right. Give me a map

2124
05:42:41,909 --> 05:42:43,909
map fragment of some kind

2125
05:42:44,310 --> 05:42:51,479
Interesting. Where are we?

2126
05:42:54,950 --> 05:42:56,950
Have you tried cheese?

2127
05:42:57,430 --> 05:42:59,270
Formula cheese or whatever that is

2128
05:42:59,270 --> 05:43:03,880
Where is this?

2129
05:43:03,880 --> 05:43:05,880
ravine veiled village

2130
05:43:06,360 --> 05:43:18,680
I'm gonna go let's go up the map fragments are already on you. Yeah, usually they show up here

2131
05:43:18,759 --> 05:43:23,240
Like i'm looking for like that's one right there

2132
05:43:23,799 --> 05:43:26,099
I'm trying to see this one here

2133
05:43:26,259 --> 05:43:29,049
in this vicinity

2134
05:43:29,049 --> 05:43:30,869
Well shit

2135
05:43:30,869 --> 05:43:40,659
just go up

2136
05:43:40,659 --> 05:43:46,979
nothing, okay

2137
05:43:46,979 --> 05:43:48,340
for

2138
05:43:48,340 --> 05:43:49,619
romundo

2139
05:43:49,619 --> 05:43:51,259
I don't know what that is

2140
05:43:51,259 --> 05:43:57,849
Remember look like you look like you can't ride a bike

2141
05:43:59,049 --> 05:44:01,049
I mean I would get on and I would go like

2142
05:44:01,900 --> 05:44:10,919
Then I would straighten out and be fine

2143
05:44:11,639 --> 05:44:16,419
You're going

2144
05:44:16,419 --> 05:44:25,380
Try the new oreo shamrock with flurry. Is it good?

2145
05:44:26,020 --> 05:44:28,580
I feel like that's too much

2146
05:44:28,580 --> 05:44:40,200
That sounds like a lot

2147
05:44:40,200 --> 05:44:42,200
oreo shamrock

2148
05:44:42,279 --> 05:44:46,060
The shamrock flurry is kind of I don't know if i'm into it yet

2149
05:44:50,330 --> 05:44:53,689
It's kind of the first like two three sips is like, oh this is kind of good and then it's just like

2150
05:44:54,900 --> 05:44:56,900
Does it kind of feel like sludge?

2151
05:44:58,970 --> 05:45:01,610
It gets like that like sludge feeling like in the back of your mouth

2152
05:45:04,659 --> 05:45:07,380
It has way too much sugar. I think that's probably what it is

2153
05:45:07,939 --> 05:45:23,799
What's this guy doing? All right, i'll take the free kill. Why not?

2154
05:45:31,290 --> 05:45:32,169
poison

2155
05:45:32,169 --> 05:45:34,169
Oh, fuck you. It is poison. All right

2156
05:45:36,459 --> 05:45:40,220
Oh, this is a disaster. Okay. Uh, I think I have one of those things I need

2157
05:45:40,860 --> 05:45:50,180
It's rot, right?

2158
05:45:50,180 --> 05:45:51,459
It's not rot

2159
05:45:51,459 --> 05:45:53,459
What is it? It's wait what?

2160
05:45:53,779 --> 05:46:03,669
Poison do I not have anything that stops poison? I thought rot was poison. What the fuck is rot then?

2161
05:46:07,159 --> 05:46:09,720
Rot is different than poison. Um, I don't think I have anything

2162
05:46:11,189 --> 05:46:17,419
Can I craft something?

2163
05:46:17,419 --> 05:46:23,819
Blood loss cures rot buildup and it's not rot. I don't I don't have any I can't make any poison blocker thingy

2164
05:46:25,400 --> 05:46:30,740
Oh, well, you can outheal it rot is poison, but it's 10. Oh, okay. So rot is like the

2165
05:46:31,779 --> 05:46:47,639
How does that look man? What's that sleep?

2166
05:46:49,180 --> 05:46:51,819
These guys just throw like all the dust at you

2167
05:46:53,560 --> 05:46:55,560
I know hold on. I want to see what's down here

2168
05:46:57,029 --> 05:46:59,029
That was probably sleep. That was probably gonna be bad

2169
05:46:59,349 --> 05:47:17,029
And nothing can also make soap to reduce poison buildup before it's full

2170
05:47:17,909 --> 05:47:20,310
Can I wash it? No, I can't wash it off, right?

2171
05:47:25,159 --> 05:47:42,869
Um, that doesn't look like it not after it fills up wait this shit over there. Ah item

2172
05:47:46,310 --> 05:47:49,509
Remind me that that's there

2173
05:47:50,069 --> 05:48:15,909
I'm at a mana fuck

2174
05:48:23,529 --> 05:48:26,250
Cracked crystals, I don't think i've seen those before

2175
05:48:27,209 --> 05:48:44,889
Cracked crystal. Oh, that's not good

2176
05:48:46,490 --> 05:48:48,490
Lightning grease

2177
05:48:48,729 --> 05:48:51,700
My god guys, what the fuck slow down

2178
05:48:52,580 --> 05:48:55,340
You're gonna poison yourselves

2179
05:48:56,779 --> 05:49:12,659
In midair, okay lightning grease

2180
05:49:13,459 --> 05:49:23,430
It's down here. Oh, it's an exploder

2181
05:49:24,310 --> 05:49:33,110
We're good ruined strewn precipice

2182
05:49:33,909 --> 05:49:45,340
Okay, it was another way I could go in the cave. I think i'm gonna go back in the cave

2183
05:49:49,700 --> 05:49:51,540
Yeah, let's go back in the cave

2184
05:49:51,540 --> 05:50:00,250
There's something I did not explore in here

2185
05:50:17,180 --> 05:50:19,180
Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2186
05:50:34,099 --> 05:50:43,659
Oh watch it watch it watch it. Where the fuck did you come from?

2187
05:50:58,950 --> 05:51:05,740
Oh

2188
05:51:05,740 --> 05:51:13,080
What do you got?

2189
05:51:13,080 --> 05:51:15,639
Well, good. I replaced the one that I was a bonehead

2190
05:51:19,909 --> 05:51:21,909
The fucking thing into the dirt

2191
05:51:21,909 --> 05:51:29,020
Did I go everywhere?

2192
05:51:29,020 --> 05:51:32,569
Wait, there's that item that I wanted to get

2193
05:51:32,569 --> 05:51:44,119
On the elevator, let me get the item on the elevator

2194
05:51:47,240 --> 05:51:49,540
Which was there, right?

2195
05:51:50,540 --> 05:51:52,299
No, i'm an idiot

2196
05:51:52,299 --> 05:51:58,860
Right like here. Oh my god. It's not right there fucking come on, dude. Seriously. I thought I saw the light

2197
05:52:01,340 --> 05:52:05,180
I saw the light and I thought the light was the ledge. I was like, i'm not I don't want to miss it

2198
05:52:05,990 --> 05:52:10,680
It was way further down. It's right. It's okay. It's all right. It's right here

2199
05:52:18,040 --> 05:52:21,479
It's way lower. I saw the green light the green lantern thing

2200
05:52:23,689 --> 05:52:27,130
Wait, wait, what's going on? That's not what I want to do

2201
05:52:27,290 --> 05:52:28,889
What's going on here?

2202
05:52:28,889 --> 05:52:30,409
Wait, what's happening?

2203
05:52:30,409 --> 05:52:32,279
Why is that here?

2204
05:52:32,279 --> 05:52:34,279
Wait, what i'm confused

2205
05:52:34,360 --> 05:52:35,880
What's going on?

2206
05:52:35,880 --> 05:52:39,080
It was this cave. Yeah

2207
05:52:39,639 --> 05:52:40,599
Oh

2208
05:52:40,599 --> 05:53:04,729
We're good

2209
05:53:04,729 --> 05:53:20,540
Way higher

2210
05:53:21,419 --> 05:53:39,779
It looks like another way to go too. Yeah, I can't summon unless there's a boss or a statue nearby

2211
05:53:39,860 --> 05:53:41,860
That's it. I did not know that the whole time i'm playing

2212
05:53:42,819 --> 05:53:58,419
All right. Where is this fucking thing? Right here smithing stone. Very cool

2213
05:53:58,900 --> 05:54:11,959
I wish it was a six

2214
05:54:11,959 --> 05:54:16,250
Is that right?

2215
05:54:16,250 --> 05:54:27,159
Okay, that's it. So now, uh

2216
05:54:28,200 --> 05:54:32,099
Just go out

2217
05:54:32,099 --> 05:54:34,979
I want the souls. No problem

2218
05:54:52,360 --> 05:54:54,119
So now let's go over here

2219
05:54:54,119 --> 05:54:56,680
So should I go up or should I go?

2220
05:54:57,400 --> 05:55:00,060
Should I be here? Maybe I should just I wonder

2221
05:55:01,659 --> 05:55:07,509
What should I do? What should I do? Should I just go?

2222
05:55:08,709 --> 05:55:13,560
Should I go up?

2223
05:55:13,560 --> 05:55:18,580
I wonder if I should leave it just go

2224
05:55:19,459 --> 05:55:21,689
I don't know

2225
05:55:21,689 --> 05:55:25,880
There's two ways to go

2226
05:55:25,880 --> 05:55:29,799
I need them. Yeah, I also I need a map to fucking lost like this

2227
05:55:49,279 --> 05:56:01,479
10 000 souls. Don't be an idiot. I'm gonna go up. Was there something else that I could do here though? I feel like I could

2228
05:56:06,580 --> 05:56:11,419
But i'm just gonna go up

2229
05:56:11,419 --> 05:56:27,479

Why did you turn it back? Uh, I see you up there you piece of shit land

2232
05:57:23,639 --> 05:57:43,819
Okay, did you drop where did the guy go? That guy where'd that guy go?

2233
05:57:57,099 --> 05:58:00,330
Climb this

2234
05:58:00,330 --> 05:58:10,580
Jump over there

2235
05:58:10,580 --> 05:58:12,979
Somber smithing stone three. That's not what I want

2236
05:58:13,779 --> 05:58:36,139
Nothing over fine. Okay, that's it now. Let's go down

2237
05:58:38,439 --> 05:58:40,439
Fall fall fall fall

2238
05:58:42,520 --> 05:58:46,040
I don't want to lose this many souls. So i'm gonna say no to the fall joke

2239
05:58:47,000 --> 05:58:49,689
Sorry

2240
05:58:49,689 --> 05:58:54,060
Maybe some of it that was one person that said that

2241
05:59:06,919 --> 05:59:09,540
Yeah, the fuck am I even going?

2242
05:59:10,180 --> 05:59:15,700
Okay

2243
05:59:15,700 --> 05:59:39,750

2244
05:59:39,750 --> 05:59:41,110
Hey up there

2245
05:59:41,110 --> 05:59:47,590

You and me

2252
06:00:52,099 --> 06:00:54,099
Sand throwing sand in my eyes

2253
06:00:54,740 --> 06:01:12,520
Nice get over here

2254
06:01:14,580 --> 06:01:39,380
Uh, uh, oh, that's a big ruin. That's a huge one. Come on. I don't have sand

2255
06:01:42,069 --> 06:01:49,430
Uh, I don't think I ever got it six is uh, just 2,500. I can definitely level up now then

2256
06:01:49,909 --> 06:02:04,819
I knew it. I knew you were gonna show up

2257
06:02:04,900 --> 06:02:09,959
I just better get knocked off

2258
06:02:10,439 --> 06:02:33,099
I'm too nervous to go that way

2259
06:02:33,180 --> 06:02:40,779
Let me scale them out

2260
06:02:42,779 --> 06:02:53,340
There's gonna be some asshole up here. I know it

2261
06:02:54,020 --> 06:02:56,819
I'm gonna get to the top and it's gonna be a boss and i'm gonna kick its ass

2262
06:02:57,220 --> 06:03:22,549
I'm gonna help you. All right, don't clear everything out first. There's two of them. Yeah, creepy looking

2263
06:03:23,110 --> 06:03:33,400
Where are the slugs?

2264
06:03:33,400 --> 06:03:42,330
Oh

Yikes

2268
06:04:13,860 --> 06:04:18,790
I wish I had my fucking magic right now

2269
06:04:19,349 --> 06:04:21,349
That would be ideal

2270
06:04:38,259 --> 06:04:56,540

2271
06:04:56,540 --> 06:05:22,569
Ugh dick. No, no, no, no, no. I know that's gonna kill me. I'm gonna play very very very cautiously

2272
06:05:23,529 --> 06:05:34,169
Dude this little fucking turret bullshit like I swear to god if I had my magic you'd be toast

2273
06:05:34,569 --> 06:05:36,569
You wouldn't even live another single second of your life

2274
06:05:38,200 --> 06:05:43,159
You're lucky I don't have a mana potion you piece of crap you're lucky I don't have fucking flask

2275
06:05:44,810 --> 06:06:13,880
Get the fuck over here

06:06:13,880 --> 06:06:20,470
I got it. I got it. That was kind of horrible

2277
06:06:26,900 --> 06:06:29,340
Okay, i'm glad I can at least replace some of those

2278
06:06:30,139 --> 06:06:33,380
I would have felt very

2279
06:06:33,459 --> 06:06:53,930
Over there. It's a big scary octopus thing. Let me check it out. I don't even think about it

2280
06:06:54,009 --> 06:07:08,979
I know what you're gonna do

2281
06:07:09,220 --> 06:07:34,180
You're not gonna kill me. Okay. Well, okay

2282
06:07:34,900 --> 06:07:37,180

Oh, okay. We're good. Oh my god. He's still chasing me

There's a flea on the hair on the dog on the frog on the log on the bog on the bottom of the seat

2292
06:09:18,069 --> 06:09:28,040

06:09:46,020 --> 06:09:51,529
Do it without leaning forward. There's uh

06:09:52,330 --> 06:09:55,290
A lee on the hair on the dog on the frog on the bog on the log at the bottom of the seat

06:12:01,990 --> 06:12:05,029
So I gotta wait don't go in yet. Just kind of let him do his thing

06:12:05,990 --> 06:12:08,360
Are you how do you how do you feel about the sorcerer?

2314

06:13:03,860 --> 06:13:08,409
All right around the pillow. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. Go

2322
06:13:09,369 --> 06:13:18,869
It's low and steady

2323
06:13:18,869 --> 06:13:27,639
Oh get him under the water

2324
06:13:27,639 --> 06:13:29,669
It's genius

2325
06:13:29,669 --> 06:13:55,400
Watch that fire dude. Don't be an idiot

2326
06:14:03,500 --> 06:14:05,500
Holy shit, he went all the way around

2327
06:14:49,419 --> 06:15:21,220
I don't know where the fuck I just was

2328
06:15:21,459 --> 06:15:52,680
Fuck that's so long

2329
06:15:52,680 --> 06:16:31,080
If i'm on that pillar, I don't like it when you're over here

2330
06:16:59,459 --> 06:17:18,900
Get rid of the fire. He's gonna do his little bullshit move where he spins

2331
06:18:03,779 --> 06:18:05,779
What no

2332
06:18:05,939 --> 06:18:07,939
One fucking hit what?

2333
06:18:09,349 --> 06:18:13,180
No way

2334
06:18:13,180 --> 06:18:19,029
What?

2335
06:18:19,029 --> 06:18:21,110
Oh, I fucking dodged right through it

2336
06:18:21,990 --> 06:18:23,990
Damn it, man. I

2337
06:18:28,310 --> 06:18:30,310
I fucking had it right there, too

2338
06:18:30,549 --> 06:18:32,790
God, what's with the fucking instant kill bullshit?

2339
06:18:35,580 --> 06:18:37,819
I fucking had it. Oh my god

2340
06:18:39,110 --> 06:18:41,110
What a fucking goddamn eye roll

2341
06:18:52,040 --> 06:19:02,659
It looked like I dodged right through it, too

2342
06:19:03,540 --> 06:19:26,650
Not as short

2343
06:19:31,799 --> 06:19:33,799
I need like 10 more points

2344
06:19:34,040 --> 06:20:02,220
Seriously bad again with this bullshit

2345
06:20:03,099 --> 06:20:50,939
I'm so fucking annoyed. I can't believe I didn't want to kill him out of the fire

2346
06:20:51,740 --> 06:21:12,729
The camera maybe dodged backwards

2347
06:21:24,169 --> 06:21:27,939
Out of the fire out out of the fire

2348
06:21:46,229 --> 06:22:37,540
I don't dodge into it this time. Oh this fire there this fire over there

2349
06:22:38,259 --> 06:23:01,979
You can see

2350
06:23:01,979 --> 06:23:06,220
Dude, I fucking didn't what the fuck I can't see

2351
06:23:07,180 --> 06:23:11,909
Like I apparently I queued up a heel and I just I didn't have the animation time to dodge

2352
06:23:16,549 --> 06:23:17,990
God damn it

2353
06:23:17,990 --> 06:23:19,990
Okay, oleg's got to come out at second phase

2354
06:23:20,470 --> 06:23:27,270
It's just like when I dodged I I guess I pressed x and it just queues up the heel when you get up

2355
06:23:27,430 --> 06:23:29,430
And I was just fucked at that point

2356
06:23:36,439 --> 06:23:38,439
And that move kills you in one hit

2357
06:23:38,520 --> 06:23:45,689
All right, oleg comes out at phase two

2358
06:23:46,090 --> 06:24:16,580
Really? Oh you piece of garbage

2359
06:24:17,380 --> 06:24:43,930
I might reset

2360
06:24:44,169 --> 06:24:49,450
I

2361
06:24:49,450 --> 06:24:52,650
Yeah, I got I burnt through two flasks in the first 15 seconds. I gotta reset

2362
06:24:59,830 --> 06:25:02,389
Use the summon. I'm waiting for phase two, dude

2363
06:25:03,189 --> 06:25:04,389
phase two

2364
06:25:04,389 --> 06:25:06,389
He dies instantly in the fire here

2365
06:25:28,740 --> 06:25:30,979
You're gonna do it back to fucking time. Really?

2366
06:25:33,860 --> 06:25:36,180
Uh, I didn't mean to press x twice. I'm full tailed

2367
06:26:23,220 --> 06:26:26,099
You're not gonna do it three times. All right. Oh, you've got

2368
06:26:57,639 --> 06:27:26,659
Slides for a dick. He's going here. We go

2369
06:27:26,659 --> 06:27:32,009
Phase two, let's go. Go get him oleg

2370
06:27:33,209 --> 06:27:59,000
Come on, my boy

2371
06:27:59,000 --> 06:28:21,659
Oleg's no good here

2372
06:28:22,939 --> 06:28:31,130
That whole I can't even go to the whole right side

2373
06:28:31,450 --> 06:28:52,299
Come here. God damn it. I got yeah

2374
06:28:53,340 --> 06:29:34,659
God fucking damn it. I'm in fire too

2375
06:29:37,220 --> 06:29:40,419
Oh my god, fuck. Oh fuck me. No

2376
06:29:41,459 --> 06:29:42,900
Oh fuck

2377
06:29:42,900 --> 06:29:44,259
Oh fuck

2378
06:29:44,259 --> 06:29:45,860
Oh fuck

2379
06:29:45,860 --> 06:29:47,860
He caught me again

2380
06:29:48,599 --> 06:29:50,759
Oh fuck. Oh fuck

2381
06:29:54,540 --> 06:29:56,220
Fuck

2382
06:29:56,220 --> 06:29:58,220
Oh fuck

2383
06:30:04,340 --> 06:30:05,459
Shit

2384
06:30:05,459 --> 06:30:07,959
Porn sounds

2385
06:30:07,959 --> 06:30:10,520
Uh, it's just if he catches you with that but like trying to bait

2386
06:30:11,849 --> 06:30:13,849
Trying to bait out that attack

2387
06:30:13,849 --> 06:30:16,729
You get in and he swings three times. The third time is the horrible one

2388
06:30:17,450 --> 06:30:19,450
When you get in close to bait it

2389
06:30:19,610 --> 06:30:24,009
It's like you can't it's like look at it's like I feel like i'm gonna fall over

2390
06:30:24,569 --> 06:30:27,500
Like looking up at a fucking giant statue

2391
06:30:36,299 --> 06:30:42,020
That's the camera is your enemy in this game because when you're locked on you just your eyes are just pointing like this

2392
06:30:42,020 --> 06:30:44,259
I'm just like, okay. What when is he coming down?

2393
06:30:48,060 --> 06:30:49,340
Let's do this

2394
06:30:49,340 --> 06:30:58,549
Try this. I feel like there's a lot of time. I might be able to actually get one of these off

2395
06:30:58,549 --> 06:31:00,389
I wonder how much damage this does

2396
06:31:00,389 --> 06:31:18,700
I don't actually a lot but it takes a while

2397
06:31:45,900 --> 06:31:46,860
Nope

2398
06:31:46,860 --> 06:31:48,380
Oh takes too long

2399
06:31:48,380 --> 06:31:51,240
Takes too long takes too long

2400
06:31:51,240 --> 06:32:15,540
Doesn't really do enough damage either

2401
06:32:24,700 --> 06:32:29,459
Fuck on he really is gonna get stuck there

2402
06:32:30,419 --> 06:32:54,700
You guys can't shoot

2403
06:32:54,700 --> 06:33:06,009
Oh boy. No, no, no, no

2404
06:33:06,650 --> 06:33:09,849
I get caught sometimes he does it like three times in a row

2405
06:33:13,060 --> 06:33:15,220
Yeah, the magic's not the magic's not gonna cut it

2406
06:33:16,860 --> 06:33:18,860
Maybe at the end if I could stay back

2407
06:33:28,389 --> 06:33:38,220
Oh my god top to clean the front

2408
06:33:56,459 --> 06:34:10,860
This is a sloppy one

2409
06:34:10,860 --> 06:34:12,220
sloppy one

2410
06:34:12,220 --> 06:34:19,639
All right, so he's trying to see if he like

2411
06:34:20,599 --> 06:34:22,840
That's a sloppy one

2412
06:34:22,840 --> 06:34:24,520
How much damage is this?

2413
06:34:24,520 --> 06:34:37,000
I think it's time for jump r2s on this guy

2414
06:34:38,139 --> 06:34:54,229
But it'd be hard to do because he can't dodge through that is he gonna get hit by the hitbox that lasts?

2415
06:34:55,189 --> 06:35:21,669
Well, just practice

2416
06:35:23,500 --> 06:35:25,099
He's still alive

2417
06:35:25,099 --> 06:35:50,569
I just don't know where the fuck I am

2418
06:35:56,419 --> 06:36:01,220
Like he puts his hands all the way over his head. So even looking up. It's like I can't see his fucking arms

2419
06:36:10,500 --> 06:36:13,450
All right last try last try

2420
06:36:14,250 --> 06:36:20,790
Last try and then i'm gonna go eat some food. I need to eat something. I need to eat food

2421
06:36:23,110 --> 06:36:25,110
I have to come back refreshed

2422
06:36:51,580 --> 06:36:55,979
I waited so fucking long too. My god you guys take an eternity to do moves in this game

2423
06:37:26,009 --> 06:37:27,770
I knew you were gonna do that

2424
06:37:27,770 --> 06:37:43,110
Damn it. I tried to dodge through it again. It didn't do it

2425
06:37:43,909 --> 06:37:46,919
Can't dodge through that when he puts it in his mouth

2426
06:37:47,400 --> 06:38:41,430
No, whoa

2427
06:38:41,430 --> 06:38:42,389
Really?

2428
06:38:42,389 --> 06:39:10,389
Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye

2429
06:39:35,509 --> 06:39:37,590
Where the fuck am I come on?

2430
06:39:38,229 --> 06:39:40,950
Dude, what the fuck man?

2431
06:39:41,669 --> 06:40:36,259
That's a bad idea man. This is my friend

2432
06:41:09,849 --> 06:41:11,849
Dude, what the fuck am I?

2433
06:41:12,470 --> 06:41:13,849
seriously

2434
06:41:13,849 --> 06:42:14,180
Oh

2435
06:42:14,180 --> 06:42:18,259
Dude, I fucking it's so annoying. Like I just don't know where the fuck even is

2436
06:42:19,930 --> 06:42:23,689
Walking on not walking on his hands go all the way into the air into the ceiling

2437
06:42:41,020 --> 06:42:43,020
Get away from me you fucker

2438
06:42:44,599 --> 06:42:47,819
You fucker

2439
06:42:47,819 --> 06:43:21,419
You motherfucker

2440
06:43:21,419 --> 06:43:37,529
Eat cheese for breakfast you fucking piece of shit. You're gonna get diarrhea in the fucking morning. I guarantee it

2441
06:43:54,810 --> 06:43:55,930
No

2442
06:43:55,930 --> 06:44:00,279
Oh, oh no. I'm running out of juice

2443
06:44:17,659 --> 06:44:19,659
Fuck you. Stop missing

2444
06:44:20,459 --> 06:44:27,909
Goddamn it

2445
06:44:27,909 --> 06:44:30,069
I'm playing this so fucking safe. You have no idea

2446
06:44:30,709 --> 06:44:33,740
You're gonna give me the cheese hall of fame for this one

2447
06:44:36,299 --> 06:44:42,099
What? Oh shit. What does this weapon power do?

2448
06:45:28,380 --> 06:45:31,290
Fuck you game

2449
06:45:31,290 --> 06:45:33,290
I'm gonna smoke that cheese all the way to the bank

2450
06:45:34,650 --> 06:45:36,569
Oh my god

2451
06:45:36,569 --> 06:45:42,520
That was so scary

2452
06:45:42,520 --> 06:45:44,520
I would I cheesed him, but we know what whatever

2453
06:45:45,159 --> 06:45:52,569
What was that?

2454
06:45:52,569 --> 06:46:06,819
Agma worm scale sword d scaling agma guillotine

2455
06:46:08,729 --> 06:46:12,040
What? Let's see

2456
06:46:12,599 --> 06:46:18,060
But I need

2457
06:46:18,060 --> 06:46:28,409
Wait, I have to sit down

2458
06:46:28,970 --> 06:46:32,270
It's not cheese. Well, I I I 50 percent

2459
06:46:36,360 --> 06:46:37,880
What the hell

2460
06:46:37,959 --> 06:46:46,279
That's actually kind of cool. All right. I mean I I didn't really cheese him I

2461
06:46:47,240 --> 06:46:55,020
Pursued him correctly and I killed him. All right, let me level up and then um, let me think about eating something

2462
06:46:55,659 --> 06:47:03,909
Some of the moves are follow-up moves

2463
06:47:04,229 --> 06:47:26,020
Fire is supposed to come out. Maybe I can't I can't wield it

2464
06:47:28,619 --> 06:47:32,520
I'm trying to do a bunch of combinations

2465
06:47:35,349 --> 06:47:39,110
Yeah, I don't know. I I think I think it's a twitch problem because this has been happening consistently all night

2466
06:47:42,090 --> 06:47:45,849
I this is not an internet problem. Somebody said that other people are having problems, too

2467
06:47:47,270 --> 06:47:57,430
Yeah, I don't meet the requirements to use it. All right. So what what else is over here? What else is before I stop?

2468
06:47:58,389 --> 06:48:11,779
Let's check out over here

2469
06:48:11,779 --> 06:48:22,009
All right. So the plan is i'm probably gonna I want to try to kill that goddamn guy. All right. Here's the plan

2470
06:48:22,889 --> 06:48:26,090
I'm gonna give it like three attempts to go fight that other dude

2471
06:48:27,450 --> 06:48:38,220
We've got rep again. I'm gonna go try. Okay. I've got more flasks. I've got more health. I've got more everything

2472
06:48:44,340 --> 06:48:56,740
I'm gonna let me try it first. Let me atlas plateau. Okay, this is really pretty

2473
06:49:00,900 --> 06:49:04,020
Did I get me six smithing stones? I don't think I did

2474
06:49:06,229 --> 06:49:08,150
This is four

2475
06:49:08,150 --> 06:49:15,639
All right. Uh, let me just touch the bonfire here. There's probably one right here somewhere

2476
06:49:16,599 --> 06:49:29,619
There's okay. All right. I'm not gonna do this area. Not yet

2477
06:49:30,340 --> 06:49:33,459
What i'm gonna do is i'm gonna i'm gonna go check it out

2478
06:49:34,340 --> 06:49:36,740
See if I can do it reliably in like one or two attempts

2479
06:49:37,459 --> 06:49:56,360
Then i'm gonna stop stream i'm gonna eat and i'll be back tomorrow I think can I level anything up?

2480
06:49:57,799 --> 06:50:09,590
I did have a lot of those uh crushes. Yeah, I think I actually might be able to get there

2481
06:50:11,400 --> 06:50:15,099
Four thousand i'll be close

2482
06:50:18,060 --> 06:50:32,630
I need a little bit more. All right, let me just get i'll kill some people. Is there people out here like right here?

2483
06:50:33,189 --> 06:50:35,189
Just people like yeah, we're gonna go to the farming zone

2484
06:50:43,799 --> 06:50:52,360
Just enough to get I want to get vitality up another point

2485
06:50:52,840 --> 06:50:54,840
I'm trying to get I want to get like 25 or 30

2486
06:50:54,840 --> 06:51:09,750
You're like 18 000

2487
06:51:09,750 --> 06:51:19,419
Like that. All right. All right

2488
06:51:26,200 --> 06:51:28,200
Knocked me off my fucking horse

2489
06:51:28,200 --> 06:51:39,529
Oh, you don't even move that far get out of here

2490
06:51:50,150 --> 06:51:52,150
There's 14

2491
06:51:57,299 --> 06:51:59,299
Any headphones in because of being a dumbass

2492
06:52:02,139 --> 06:52:25,639
Ow

2493
06:52:25,639 --> 06:52:27,340
Stop it

2494
06:52:27,340 --> 06:52:51,659
Oh my god, they weren't even trying to kill me. They got me

2495
06:52:52,459 --> 06:53:26,310
All right. What am I needing now? I need like a thousand two thousand one or two more of these dogs will do it. I think

2496
06:53:26,790 --> 06:53:31,189
Let's go ahead and just make this easy on ourselves. Why don't we?

2497
06:53:48,950 --> 06:54:19,560
Back up back up back up run away. Whoa easy

2498
06:54:20,279 --> 06:54:23,880
Who the fuck are you?

2499
06:54:23,880 --> 06:54:27,240
Okay, we're almost there

2500
06:54:27,240 --> 06:54:28,919
Almost there

2501
06:54:28,919 --> 06:54:35,909
Put on your old uh gear. Yeah, that's a good point. That's a very good point

2502
06:54:38,099 --> 06:54:41,819
Let's just respawn everybody one more time

2503
06:54:41,819 --> 06:54:45,900
All right, we're giving it three attempts. That's it. I promise three attempts and that's it

2504
06:54:49,450 --> 06:54:54,169
I'm just gonna do the thing. I was doing before i'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna I got some extra levels

2505
06:54:54,970 --> 06:54:58,619
I can't do it. I'll i'll do it again another time

2506
06:55:03,270 --> 06:55:36,090
Okay, I think i'm there

2507
06:55:36,090 --> 06:55:38,069
I don't want to get too many

2508
06:55:38,069 --> 06:55:41,459
Yeah, i'm definitely all right. Let's go

2509
06:55:42,020 --> 06:55:56,139
I'm still getting chased

2510
06:55:56,139 --> 06:56:02,090
All right. Here we go. Let's give it a few tries. I'm only gonna try it a few times. I'm not gonna do anything stupid

2511
06:56:02,729 --> 06:56:11,159
Are you ready?

2512
06:56:11,159 --> 06:56:12,360
We good

2513
06:56:12,360 --> 06:56:16,900
I gotta change my flasks

2514
06:56:17,060 --> 06:56:20,950
Because what does that he he what man what kind of damage is he doing?

2515
06:56:23,299 --> 06:56:25,700
Very nice. Just think I think it's good all around

2516
06:56:26,650 --> 06:56:28,150
Would it be like

2517
06:56:28,150 --> 06:56:29,369
slashing

2518
06:56:29,369 --> 06:56:31,209
He has magic too though

2519
06:56:31,209 --> 06:56:35,369
He has that like wave of magic

2520
06:56:37,209 --> 06:56:49,189
Hmm

2521
06:56:49,189 --> 06:56:52,650
Uh, i'll put the these are good

2522
06:56:54,580 --> 06:56:56,180
Something drilling right? Yep

2523
06:56:56,180 --> 06:56:58,500
Yeah, that's good

2524
06:56:58,500 --> 06:57:03,139
Potency of sorceries restores hp. Do I have any like lightning damage?

2525
06:57:03,860 --> 06:57:06,549
Holy damage or something reduction

2526
06:57:06,950 --> 06:57:10,259
I think that's good

2527
06:57:10,259 --> 06:57:17,619
Okay, here we go. Are you okay? Um, yeah, i'm fine. The game's hard and frustrating

2528
06:57:22,889 --> 06:57:23,770
All right

2529
06:57:23,770 --> 06:57:25,770
Three attempts and then i'm calling it tonight

2530
06:57:26,009 --> 06:57:42,900
And then we'll come back to it probably tomorrow. I need to get some food through the dragon powers. We'll we'll do that tomorrow

2531
06:57:43,380 --> 06:57:54,680
I just want to see if I can get get this done. Sometimes you beat him on your first try. I mean

2532
06:57:55,639 --> 06:57:57,290
I'm still

2533
06:57:57,290 --> 06:57:59,290
I'm still gonna probably leave

2534
06:58:04,790 --> 06:58:10,200
Can I open these?

2535
06:58:10,200 --> 06:58:13,400
Uh, wait, what's going on?

2536
06:58:13,479 --> 06:58:15,909
Uh, do I have to say yes to him? I do don't I?

2537
06:58:16,470 --> 06:58:26,740
All right, everybody I need total silence for this

2538
06:58:29,750 --> 06:58:31,750
I need complete 100 total silence

2539
06:58:32,150 --> 06:58:37,430
We must make merry if anybody does a chat message. I'll hear it and it'll freak me out

2540
06:58:41,909 --> 06:58:43,909
No chatting no messages

2541
06:58:44,979 --> 06:58:50,810
done three attempts

2542
06:58:50,810 --> 06:59:25,290
Let's go

2543
06:59:25,290 --> 07:00:57,419
Oh fuck everybody get in. All right, let's go find some more summoning signs. Is that too far away? Nope

2544
07:00:57,979 --> 07:01:26,330
I need those signs right now, please

2545
07:01:55,220 --> 07:03:34,650
Where are the other ones here somewhere where's the meteor he falls away from me brand get him away

2546
07:03:46,939 --> 07:03:52,020
I need more summons. Where are they? I gotta go find them. It's only like three people there

2547
07:03:54,500 --> 07:04:09,099
They up on the top of the hill. Let's go

2548
07:04:09,659 --> 07:04:29,700
I don't know the hell that was but I don't want to be part of that

2549
07:04:30,419 --> 07:04:44,630
All right, there's one down there. All right, let's go see if I can get a couple hits

2550
07:04:45,750 --> 07:05:04,659
Where is it? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

2551
07:05:05,540 --> 07:05:39,959
Oh man, here they go

2552
07:05:40,119 --> 07:05:43,959
What hit me I got like two of them

2553
07:05:44,900 --> 07:05:49,259
What?

2554
07:05:49,259 --> 07:05:57,819
Aye, aye, dude

2555
07:05:57,819 --> 07:05:59,979
All right. Well, this is a major problem. I'm already seeing here

2556
07:06:00,979 --> 07:06:05,860
Here's the here's the huge problem. I should not have seven fucking flasks. This is

2557
07:06:06,500 --> 07:06:08,869
a huge problem

2558
07:06:08,869 --> 07:06:16,889
It's a big problem

2559
07:06:16,889 --> 07:06:20,169
Uh, two healing potions. I should not be hit more than one or two times ever

2560
07:06:20,810 --> 07:06:32,630
Try it again one hits. Are you gonna get one shot?

2561
07:06:33,430 --> 07:06:34,869
Yeah, I

2562
07:06:35,319 --> 07:06:39,639
It's I it's weird because sometimes he gets into range and they don't attack me

2563
07:06:40,279 --> 07:06:44,520
They just kind of still sit there. I wonder what the actual timing is on having them actually attack

2564
07:06:45,080 --> 07:06:47,400
Sometimes it just feels kind of random

2565
07:06:48,200 --> 07:06:50,200
Because i'll be close to him and he won't nothing

2566
07:06:50,599 --> 07:06:52,599
the npcs

2567
07:06:52,599 --> 07:06:54,599
We're all over them and they weren't firing

2568
07:06:57,029 --> 07:07:01,590
Shouldn't even need to take one healing potion. Yeah, but you know, i'm gonna take two

2569
07:07:05,619 --> 07:07:08,099
Oh my god, I have to say

2570
07:07:08,099 --> 07:07:11,349
Yes to him again

2571
07:07:11,349 --> 07:07:13,349
Be sure if you get too far away

2572
07:07:13,750 --> 07:07:15,830
I mean, I sometimes i'm across the whole map

2573
07:07:22,009 --> 07:07:24,569
But now they don't fire if you're in melee range

2574
07:07:27,349 --> 07:07:33,479
Accurate he roars. That's how you know, he does it really

2575
07:07:42,299 --> 07:07:44,700
Do I have the right armor? I don't really have anything else. That's better

2576
07:07:45,259 --> 07:07:49,419
Like the carrion knight stuff, which is just kind of generally just good all around

2577
07:07:50,299 --> 07:07:55,500
You should use a rune arc for this. All right, i'm gonna use a rune arc and hopefully it doesn't come back and bite me in the ass

2578
07:07:55,500 --> 07:07:57,500
I'm using one right now

2579
07:07:57,979 --> 07:08:01,099
All right, if I die immediately to this first thing i'm gonna

2580
07:08:02,299 --> 07:08:04,139
I'm gonna be very upset

2581
07:08:04,139 --> 07:08:12,009
Okay, here we go. This is the one. This is actually the one we're gonna do it right here. This is the one

2582
07:08:12,090 --> 07:08:14,090
I'm this is copium and that's fine

2583
07:08:14,330 --> 07:08:57,659
I thought it was gonna hit me

2584
07:08:57,659 --> 07:09:00,939
and

2585
07:09:00,939 --> 07:09:02,860
What the fuck?

2586
07:09:02,860 --> 07:09:06,310
bro

2587
07:09:06,310 --> 07:09:08,229
Okay, bro

2588
07:09:08,229 --> 07:09:10,229
What are you fucking doing?

2589
07:09:31,000 --> 07:10:33,979
Are you fucking

2590
07:10:34,459 --> 07:10:51,750
Are you still alive up there? Who's even alive up there? I thought he was still alive

2591
07:10:53,270 --> 07:11:40,169
Okay, sorry

2592
07:11:40,169 --> 07:11:42,650
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Where is he going?

2593
07:11:47,900 --> 07:11:50,220
I don't know which way he went. I don't know which way he went

2594
07:11:51,020 --> 07:11:56,709
We're good. I actually have no idea where the fuck he is

2595
07:11:57,349 --> 07:12:15,459
All right, dude, I don't know. I don't know

2596
07:12:15,779 --> 07:12:21,860
I'm not in melee range and they're not firing at me though

2597
07:12:22,580 --> 07:12:33,580
Why they're not firing? Let's say if you're if you're in not in melee range remember it was

2598
07:12:34,380 --> 07:12:47,380
Or if I get in melee range what happens I don't understand I'm fucked they only fire during certain moves

2599
07:12:52,090 --> 07:12:53,450
My god

2600
07:12:53,450 --> 07:13:01,259
Do I have to get off the horse?

2601
07:13:02,540 --> 07:13:04,900
Jesus

2602
07:13:04,900 --> 07:13:08,169
fucking hell man

2603
07:13:08,250 --> 07:13:13,849
Even if I didn't look at chat like I why did you stop shooting because I it's it's you stand so still

2604
07:13:15,639 --> 07:13:17,639
Roll them. I i'm on the horse

2605
07:13:18,520 --> 07:13:21,020
Get off the horse and roll them

2606
07:13:22,229 --> 07:13:25,750
Is that like worth getting off the horse and just like just sitting there and waiting till he fires them

2607
07:13:26,470 --> 07:13:47,799
I lost the ruinarc. I I I can't use a ruinarc until I get that down because like I just still don't understand

2608
07:13:48,840 --> 07:13:51,590
Is it just get off the horse?

2609
07:13:51,750 --> 07:13:59,180
I don't even know what the timing's like either

2610
07:13:59,419 --> 07:14:25,619
Shit my horse. How long does it take for the horse to respawn?

2611
07:14:26,340 --> 07:14:27,700
Without a heal

2612
07:14:27,700 --> 07:14:33,459
I'm hitting him with a fucking stab

2613
07:14:35,740 --> 07:14:36,779
Doesn't

2614
07:14:36,779 --> 07:14:38,659
That's not good

2615
07:14:38,659 --> 07:14:54,060
So i'm gonna get off the horse and i'm gonna dodge those things

2616
07:14:54,779 --> 07:14:58,569
Christ

2617
07:14:58,569 --> 07:15:38,169
Too far away, I think

2618
07:15:38,490 --> 07:15:59,619
Did I get it? I have no idea. I think so. They appear together

2619
07:16:00,259 --> 07:16:08,979
Let's fucking summon everybody. Whatever. Well, he's not gonna despawn

2620
07:16:09,939 --> 07:17:13,610
What the fuck you're coming for me still that's not cool

2621
07:17:14,569 --> 07:17:20,520
What do I do to you leave me alone?

2622
07:17:20,680 --> 07:17:35,610
Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right move move men

2623
07:17:36,810 --> 07:18:28,680
All right, get off the horse

2624
07:18:28,680 --> 07:18:43,020
Huh? Oh fuck

2625
07:18:47,299 --> 07:18:51,720
Oh

2626
07:18:56,919 --> 07:18:59,319
I can't get on the horse fast enough afterwards, dude

2627
07:19:01,770 --> 07:19:03,049
Oh like

2628
07:19:03,049 --> 07:19:07,479
Of course you have to do that move

2629
07:19:07,479 --> 07:19:14,380
Get back on the horse. Yeah, I it takes three or four seconds

2630
07:19:16,409 --> 07:19:20,490
Stay on the horse and dodge the meatballs. Can you though? I feel like they're homing missiles

2631
07:19:21,130 --> 07:19:29,459
fucking sorcery, man

2632
07:19:29,459 --> 07:19:31,529
Horse mount has eye frames

2633
07:19:31,529 --> 07:19:36,889
Could I theoretically okay, could I theoretically get on the horse when he shoots them?

2634
07:19:39,270 --> 07:19:46,380
Probably could right at least a second maybe I think that's the play

2635
07:19:49,770 --> 07:19:51,849
Dude I in the fucking heart was just kill me

2636
07:19:52,810 --> 07:19:57,290
It's so frustrating. It's like dude, like does it have to go home to my body going that fast?

2637
07:19:57,689 --> 07:20:13,319
Like I was trying to get it to hit the fucking thing hopping on the horse as the rolling eye frames

2638
07:20:13,880 --> 07:20:15,400
i'm gonna try to

2639
07:20:15,400 --> 07:20:17,400
dodge the first one

2640
07:20:17,639 --> 07:20:19,080
and then

2641
07:20:19,080 --> 07:20:23,880
Get on the horse when he shoots the second one that should do it and that should be it

2642
07:20:23,880 --> 07:20:35,049
That should be the one that should literally be the one. Oh, yeah, i'm i'm done after this. I would love to beat him

2643
07:20:35,849 --> 07:20:38,970
Do this bullshit tomorrow because I don't ever want to fucking fight this guy again

2644
07:20:39,689 --> 07:20:42,119
I'll put game charles in

2645
07:20:42,439 --> 07:21:06,360
And like skip this boss on my next play for you. You're not gonna do it again. Are you?

2646
07:21:07,000 --> 07:21:08,599
Yes, you are

2647
07:21:08,599 --> 07:21:23,099
All right, let's go

2648
07:21:23,099 --> 07:21:25,099
I got really screwed on the first few hours, too

2649
07:21:25,740 --> 07:22:36,490
I'm gonna start so i'm gonna stop and we're gonna move here

2650
07:22:37,450 --> 07:22:41,860
Come on, where are you at over here?

2651
07:22:42,099 --> 07:22:46,020
Where are they?

2652
07:22:46,020 --> 07:22:48,020
Oh, come on. Where are you?

2653
07:22:48,020 --> 07:22:50,020
Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you there?

2654
07:23:07,939 --> 07:24:10,970
Whoa more over here

2655
07:24:11,209 --> 07:24:13,849
Egads, I mean that's the egads like seriously

2656
07:24:14,490 --> 07:24:22,169
There he goes. He's going up

2657
07:24:38,439 --> 07:25:03,259
Every time I scream doesn't matter. Okay. Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

2658
07:25:03,340 --> 07:25:04,619
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

2659
07:25:04,619 --> 07:25:22,439
I think I can jump

2660
07:25:22,520 --> 07:25:24,520
Oh fuck he's coming for me

2661
07:25:25,240 --> 07:25:49,819
Don't work. Don't work. Don't work. You gotta

2662
07:25:50,459 --> 07:25:52,459
Dodge dodge call don't work

2663
07:25:57,450 --> 07:26:00,709
You have to attack him

2664
07:26:00,709 --> 07:26:03,270
I I know but I want to get summons

2665
07:26:10,259 --> 07:26:15,939
That second phase is so hard for this character because I have I don't i'm not I don't have that many points in like melee

2666
07:26:16,740 --> 07:26:25,770
I mean I i'm getting up in there, but then like the meatballs are gonna fire this guy just is fucking hell

2667
07:26:33,180 --> 07:26:35,180
Maybe I need more like endurance or something. I don't know

2668
07:26:47,689 --> 07:26:49,689
My ass

2669
07:26:51,369 --> 07:26:56,919
Are you gonna are you gonna do that shit again you're gonna fire you're gonna do it again, of course you are

2670
07:26:58,229 --> 07:27:29,430
Why would you do anything else? I didn't even summon these guys either. I can't even get fucking close

2671
07:27:29,830 --> 07:27:31,669
Like this next to so

2672
07:27:31,669 --> 07:27:34,549
I can't how how do I approach him?

2673
07:27:35,189 --> 07:27:37,560
Like I was gonna go and do melee attacks

2674
07:27:37,959 --> 07:27:42,860
It's like a fucking god fucking hell

2675
07:27:43,659 --> 07:27:59,830
Okay, I gotta stick with the same strategy because like honest to god

2676
07:28:00,549 --> 07:28:02,549
Melee might be a good idea

2677
07:28:03,419 --> 07:28:09,099
But hear me out. I fought this guy for four fucking hours and I have I have no idea what those timings are

2678
07:28:09,819 --> 07:28:11,900
I have to try to beat him the way with i'm doing the sorcery

2679
07:28:14,599 --> 07:28:17,880
It's probably like I could probably do it. Right, but he's on the horse though

2680
07:28:17,880 --> 07:28:20,040
I feel like he's moving around so much faster than you could

2681
07:28:20,840 --> 07:28:22,840
How do you close the gap if you do melee?

2682
07:28:23,000 --> 07:28:25,000
Just horse melee

2683
07:28:25,080 --> 07:28:32,250
I don't know like that's hard

2684
07:28:55,880 --> 07:28:57,880
Yeah, go forward on that

2685
07:28:57,959 --> 07:29:11,689
I gotta get at least one more decent attack before I call it. Yeah patches doesn't do anything. I don't why why am I even summoning patches?

2686
07:29:11,689 --> 07:29:13,689
He's a fucking piece of shit. It didn't do anything

2687
07:29:14,169 --> 07:29:22,700
Let's try I I gotta get at least I gotta get one more solid attempt

2688
07:31:07,380 --> 07:31:13,860
Somebody's gotta somebody's got a fucking backstab on what holy shit somebody just saved the day. All right, relax relax relax

2689
07:31:13,860 --> 07:31:15,060
Relax, where do I go?

2690
07:31:15,060 --> 07:31:16,889
Where does he come from?

2691
07:31:16,889 --> 07:31:18,889
Where does he come from? Where does he go? Where does he come from? Where does he go?

2692
07:31:19,369 --> 07:31:24,040
Where does he come from? Where does he go? There he is

2693
07:31:32,470 --> 07:31:35,689
Oh fucking come on not i'm not immediately

2694
07:31:41,380 --> 07:31:46,099
I need summons too. Oh, i'm in deep trouble now. Come on. Do it now. Let me dodge him both and get on the horse quick

2695
07:31:46,979 --> 07:31:55,029
You had to do that. I couldn't

2696
07:31:55,509 --> 07:32:06,869
It's fine. It's fine. Oh you fucking gotta be kidding me

2697
07:32:08,180 --> 07:32:12,650
Do it do the move, please do the move, please do the move

2698
07:32:28,229 --> 07:32:30,580
Asshole do it

2699
07:32:30,580 --> 07:32:32,580
Is that it? That's not it

2700
07:34:22,580 --> 07:34:51,560
What kill him

2701
07:34:51,560 --> 07:34:53,560
Oh

2702
07:35:12,360 --> 07:35:29,080
That was too hard it was too much I don't like that one i'm not doing that anymore

2703
07:35:29,880 --> 07:35:33,659
I'm not gonna play that one anymore. That was too hard

2704
07:35:34,549 --> 07:36:00,169
Too hard for me. I think i've i've done it. I look like shit man. I've looked like shit this whole fucking day

2705
07:36:03,110 --> 07:36:05,110
I look like shit

2706
07:36:10,259 --> 07:36:15,139
You know what it looks like this whole time i've been upside down and I haven't told you yet

2707
07:36:15,779 --> 07:36:18,659
You know what I mean? Like I look like my I look like i'm hanging upside down

2708
07:36:26,840 --> 07:36:29,880
Like all that's gonna happen is eventually this thing's gonna flip and you're gonna be like, holy shit

2709
07:36:29,880 --> 07:36:32,919
This guy's been live for seven and a half hours streaming upside down

2710
07:36:35,639 --> 07:36:37,819
Damn

2711
07:36:37,819 --> 07:36:47,720
Oh, that was fucking horrible. What a sick way to fight the glory of the clashes shared by radon

2712
07:36:48,200 --> 07:36:56,330
No, that guy was an asshole. I saw that was there was no glory in that afterwards falling star right before our own father

2713
07:36:56,490 --> 07:36:58,650
My radon was holding back something of that scale

2714
07:36:59,290 --> 07:37:01,290
He was a living legend if ever I saw one

2715
07:37:01,930 --> 07:37:04,409
And the path has now been cleared to nokla

2716
07:37:05,139 --> 07:37:07,139
Irani's fate would be decided

2717
07:37:07,220 --> 07:37:09,220
Let's meet where the falling star bit the earth

2718
07:37:10,020 --> 07:37:12,580
We'll take up our souls once more. You should get some food

2719
07:37:14,659 --> 07:37:17,770
I don't even know if this guy's name is

2720
07:37:17,770 --> 07:37:18,889
Okay

2721
07:37:18,889 --> 07:37:21,259
I have 70 000 souls

2722
07:37:21,419 --> 07:37:25,560
Let's keep talking. Hold on. We're not done. Let's meet with a falling star bit the earth

2723
07:37:26,200 --> 07:37:28,200
My only purpose is to fight for ronnie's fate

2724
07:37:28,759 --> 07:37:31,720
So okay, so we're gonna go with it with a star fell to the earth

2725
07:37:32,759 --> 07:37:39,419
I'm a final. Okay. What about the pot guy?

2726
07:37:44,709 --> 07:37:49,590
Hello there. It was a battle marvellously fought

2727
07:37:50,389 --> 07:37:52,630
You are well and truly a champion friend

2728
07:37:53,450 --> 07:37:55,450
I on the other hand

2729
07:37:55,529 --> 07:38:02,099
Have nothing but a croc one hit was all it will come back tomorrow strong and i'm gonna know i'm not gonna get angry tomorrow

2730
07:38:02,099 --> 07:38:04,099
I promise after that

2731
07:38:06,069 --> 07:38:08,500
hid like a coward and as such

2732
07:38:09,139 --> 07:38:12,310
Oddly stand to face one such as you

2733
07:38:14,599 --> 07:38:16,279
You did good pot

2734
07:38:16,279 --> 07:38:18,599
I want to know don't you think i've given up who?

2735
07:38:19,080 --> 07:38:21,080
Parried him

2736
07:38:24,040 --> 07:38:26,759
This whole stream, I don't know who it was

2737
07:38:28,599 --> 07:38:34,360
Somebody parried him mighty warrior again in no time like which one of you dickheads did that the body's found here

2738
07:38:34,599 --> 07:38:39,979
Who could expect any less? I want to look back and see who did that shattering

2739
07:38:44,150 --> 07:38:47,509
Just you wait and see friend i'll grow even stronger

2740
07:38:48,409 --> 07:38:52,810
Just you wait when next we meet we should be friends. I don't want to fight anybody anymore

2741
07:38:52,889 --> 07:38:57,130
Can't we can I just like go ahead i'll throw in the towel and just like kind of watch the rest of the time

2742
07:38:59,500 --> 07:39:04,060
Here like you just take my staff and i'll just like ride on your back and just you play and

2743
07:39:04,700 --> 07:39:06,700
Whatever. Yeah, you can be the elden lord. It's like this

2744
07:39:07,340 --> 07:39:12,060
It's it's way too much stress. You know what I mean? Like I did my I killed uh radan

2745
07:39:13,189 --> 07:39:15,750
When we did I know i'm taking credit for that which is kind of fucked up

2746
07:39:15,830 --> 07:39:20,150
That body's found who could expect any less from the very warriors who fought in the shattering

2747
07:39:20,790 --> 07:39:22,790
the greatest of all wars

2748
07:39:22,869 --> 07:39:23,750
Okay

2749
07:39:23,750 --> 07:39:25,750
Just you wait and just you wait

2750
07:39:26,549 --> 07:39:29,669
So i'm good. So let's activate this i'm gonna level up and then i'll see you tomorrow

2751
07:39:33,639 --> 07:39:43,319
He's too old from software anymore sage. He's too old for from software what?

2752
07:39:44,439 --> 07:39:48,970
This fight is so hard

2753
07:39:48,970 --> 07:39:52,650
It's just so much. It's like when you your brain like knows what you have to do

2754
07:39:53,689 --> 07:39:58,970
You just won't it won't do it and then I just want I I so badly wanted my brain to do certain things

2755
07:40:00,259 --> 07:40:03,939
And he's he's a he's a righteous piece of shit. Like i'll be honest

2756
07:40:04,819 --> 07:40:07,750
He is a righteous piece of shit. That was

2757
07:40:08,790 --> 07:40:12,860
That was just that was rough. That was rough. You guys are righteous piece of shit

2758
07:40:17,020 --> 07:40:18,919
I think

2759
07:40:18,919 --> 07:40:23,479
Uh, I think I gotta just stack vitality at this point. Let's try to get it to 30

2760
07:40:24,119 --> 07:40:27,770
Either that or we put up decks

2761
07:40:38,220 --> 07:40:39,900
Harder than sakiro

2762
07:40:39,900 --> 07:40:42,470
No, it's different

2763
07:40:42,470 --> 07:40:44,599
it's I don't know

2764
07:40:44,599 --> 07:40:46,599
it's definitely very difficult, but

2765
07:40:47,400 --> 07:40:50,040
They give you enough tools to make it so it you'll get it

2766
07:40:51,340 --> 07:40:52,779
in sakiro

2767
07:40:52,779 --> 07:40:57,340
Your only tool was being able to hit l1 at the right time. That was it

2768
07:40:57,900 --> 07:41:01,860
So, all right, you got these like summons. You got these like magical spells. You got a horse, right?

2769
07:41:01,939 --> 07:41:04,020
There's a lot of ways to go about playing

2770
07:41:04,740 --> 07:41:08,009
this game

2771
07:41:08,009 --> 07:41:11,290
Sakiro you had to do one thing and you had to do it. Well, otherwise it was over

2772
07:41:11,689 --> 07:41:20,259
You might kind of be able to get to that staff

2773
07:41:20,819 --> 07:41:27,900
Okay, i'm gonna do

2774
07:41:27,900 --> 07:41:29,900
I'm gonna regret that later, but fucking whatever

2775
07:41:30,700 --> 07:41:41,049
What do I need for some of this stuff?

2776
07:41:41,049 --> 07:41:43,049
That staff is 52

2777
07:41:43,529 --> 07:41:46,250
Which with my equipment on it's 33

2778
07:41:47,369 --> 07:41:49,369
This thing on it's 36

2779
07:41:50,729 --> 07:41:52,729
So I could definitely get there

2780
07:41:52,970 --> 07:41:58,220
Gotta get bigger to 25. Yeah, that's the plan now

2781
07:41:59,900 --> 07:42:01,900
All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow

2782
07:42:02,139 --> 07:42:04,580
It looks like it's stressed out. I'm just tired

2783
07:42:05,299 --> 07:42:14,169
Helm nerfs your strength that your hp and stamp. Yeah, it does

2784
07:42:14,970 --> 07:42:20,139
This is that was that was crazy. That's crazy. I definitely need some protein or something

2785
07:42:21,380 --> 07:42:23,380
I'm currently melting

2786
07:42:23,459 --> 07:42:26,500
I don't understand what's going on with the internet stuff. I think it's a twitch problem

2787
07:42:26,500 --> 07:42:28,819
But if it's not then that's kind of frustrating too

2788
07:42:31,299 --> 07:42:35,380
All right, i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll start at somewhere around four o'clock

2789
07:42:37,180 --> 07:42:38,700
And we'll go from there

2790
07:42:38,700 --> 07:42:43,220
That was elden ring

2791
07:42:43,220 --> 07:42:50,520
Art good night

2792
07:42:51,000 --> 07:42:54,900
Daylighter

2793
07:42:54,900 --> 07:42:56,659
It turned purple

2794
07:42:56,659 --> 07:43:02,709
I did

2795
07:43:02,709 --> 07:43:04,709
Beat the game what no

2796
07:43:05,029 --> 07:43:06,790
Not even close

2797
07:43:06,790 --> 07:43:08,229
i'm probably a thousand

2798
07:43:08,229 --> 07:43:13,180
Years away from beating it

2799
07:43:13,180 --> 07:43:15,099
I couldn't watch any of the stream because i'm playing it myself

2800
07:43:15,099 --> 07:43:19,020
But listening to this just sounded like you were on the water park ride from hell

2801
07:43:23,750 --> 07:43:30,139
That guy was hell

2802
07:43:30,139 --> 07:43:32,139
That was absolute hell

2803
07:43:35,720 --> 07:43:40,279
But he's dead and we can we can keep going

2804
07:43:40,919 --> 07:43:47,799
Yeah, this this is uh, this has been complain andy

2805
07:43:48,520 --> 07:43:51,020
i'm the guy that complains about uh

2806
07:43:52,150 --> 07:43:55,590
The game the whole time he's playing it what i'm known for

2807
07:43:56,790 --> 07:44:06,220
For all the streams and guy you'll see tomorrow. I'm playing andy part six. That's a good title

2808
07:44:09,880 --> 07:44:13,770
Yeah, see you tomorrow at four o'clock. I just love you. Thanks for hanging out

2809
07:44:13,770 --> 07:44:14,650
I know these go late

I'm very much in the grind set right now and i'm gonna be back prepared tomorrow tomorrow is gonna i'm gonna lock in
