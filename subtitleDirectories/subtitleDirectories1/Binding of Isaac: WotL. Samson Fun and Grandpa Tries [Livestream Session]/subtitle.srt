1
00:00:02,359 --> 00:00:13,509
Let's see if I can do it with Samson. All fingers are pointing to no. So, let's go guys.

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,609
So, wait, what? Why do I have a spirit heart? I'm not exactly sure why that happened. Envy right

3
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,649
off the bat. But okay, so Samson, the way Samson works, every time you hit an enemy, you get

4
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,289
stronger tiers. Like every five to 10 hits or something like that, you get stronger. See how

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:46,500
I'm turning red? I got like a pink kind of tinge to my body right now. It means I'm doing a little

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,289
bit more damage. Every hit. But as you can tell, he has only one heart, so it's just like, nope,

7
00:00:53,289 --> 00:01:00,729
you're gonna die. Why is Envy in like the first room and the first level? That's just a lot of

8
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:14,920
malarkey, if you ask me. Oh my god, why is this guy blue? That guy's like a grape. Hello from

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:24,120
Alabama. Hello from Boston. City of Boston. Well, I can't believe I didn't get a hit. City of hot dogs,

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:36,840
bright lights, and a Boston Red Sox. Well, that didn't take forever. Is it every kill? Okay,

11
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,980
it's every kill then. So, he can be pretty, if you get a lot of HP up, he can be pretty powerful.

12
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,579
But of course, we're in the spider room, so I'm probably gonna die like right now.

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:59,819
Oh god, this is the worst. If I die in this room, I swear I should have already been dead,

14
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:06,140
to be honest. I don't know where that spirit heart even came from. I should be dead right now.

15
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,180
But I'm gonna take it to stride. You know what, I got a second chance. It's time to do this thing.

16
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:26,139
All right, come on. Come on, you like cupcake. You meat cupcake. Let's get that item. Have I

17
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:31,370
met the scout in Boston? Yeah, I see him like riding his bike all the time.

18
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,740
He's always like riding around wicked fast, like a psycho.

19
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,020
Oh, so he got buffed. That's what it is. All right. Well, what about Judas? I mean,

20
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,740
so would you, why would you ever play as Judas now? Isn't Judas have one heart or does he have two?

21
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,419
Because I mean, if that's a buff, I can't think of a reason why you would ever play

22
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,689
as anybody else. If you go over Judas, at least. Come on, blow up the secret room.

23
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,139
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna make it. I don't think I'm gonna do this. Yep, it's,

24
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,819
it's widow. I don't think I'm gonna do this, guys. I might have to start this over again.

25
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:27,530
Oh no, no way. No way. Not a chance. Not a chance. We're gonna reach right. Okay. All right,

26
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,080
hopefully I don't run into the spider boss again. I don't think I will because we're not in the

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,800
spider catacomb place right now. Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna rage. Not gonna rage you yet.

28
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:49,060
Homing shots. Good, good, good, good, good. Hey, it's always good to get your Binding of Isaac

29
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,460
deaths out of the way in the very beginning. Especially when you play on the stupid spider

30
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:03,580
level. That's way too hot. I think the spider level shouldn't be able, like, to spawn until,

31
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,300
like, the second, at least the second or third run. Because if you're playing as a character

32
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,180
like this, it's, there's no way you're gonna beat that spider boss with one heart. There's no way.

33
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,439
I mean, I guess you could if you were really good.

34
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,959
All right, doing much better. Let's continue down here.

35
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,970
Yeah, I was a little late today to the stream. And that's because I actually went out last night

36
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,980
for the first time in a very long time. And I got a little under the weather, as they say.

37
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:55,220
Heh. And I woke up a little too late. But, hmm, should I get the key and get the crate?

38
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,970
Why am I saying crate? Too many games do crates lately. No, we're not gonna do that yet.

39
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,790
I don't think it's worth it. Yeah, unless you're, like, a character like Kane or,

40
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,269
even Isaac can probably do it, but all the other, oh, Magdalen can, you can do with Magdalen.

41
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:25,699
Let's keep going this way. Get out of here, you bugs. Whoa, didn't even see that guy. That guy

42
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:38,199
came out of nowhere. I didn't even check my rearview mirror. How could you ever delete

43
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:47,939
the binding of Isaac? This game is too good. Everything about this game is good. Except

44
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:54,730
there's one bad part about this game. It has to end. Like, when you're playing, it has to be,

45
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:08,519
like, over. Ooh, ace of spades. The ace of spades. No, not doing that. Not with Samson.

46
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:21,339
Oh, let me walk over the spikes. That's a great idea. Oh, I want that chest. But I don't want

47
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:28,680
that chest, because it might be something not worth it. Decisions, decisions. Oh, you know what?

48
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:37,029
Yolo, you only live once. Let's do it. I'm opening this chest. All right, give me something good.

49
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:49,110
Oh, yeah. That was so worth it. Oh, well, you know what? You gotta take risks sometimes.

50
00:06:50,500 --> 00:07:00,069
It's not gonna pay off sometimes, apparently. All right, let's go whoop this guy's butt.

51
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:09,740
All right, Mastro. Oh, two Mastros. That's not ever a good thing. And you gotta fight two of

52
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:25,480
the same Mastro. Come on, Burger Boy. Come on, Burger Boy. Oh, come on. Why did it have to be

53
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Monstros? They're just, they're so happy. I feel like these guys aren't even really trying to hurt

54
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,639
me. They're just trying to like play. You look at them, they're just like, hey, I just want to

55
00:07:37,639 --> 00:08:02,759
jump and throw up. Will one of them just go away? Just go away. Come on. Oh, my God, Samson, you

56
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,959
bastard. Why is this still two? Okay, geez, it took to like 10% health to get one of these

57
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:24,439
bastards out of here. Okay, we're good to go. Two hearts. We got it. Do I have any bombs?

58
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:34,899
I do not have any bombs, so I gotta just go. Who is Burger Boy, really? Burger Boy is one, oh,

59
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:42,649
Curse of Darkness. This is, ugh. Burger Boy is one of my real life good friends. And he's also

60
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:48,740
crazy. But that's good. That's like a good quality. Because we're all crazy.

61
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:01,100
But Burger Boy is also the egg. And there's a, uh, might be a special video coming soon.

62
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,259
Coming soon. Not like tomorrow, not like next week. But there might be the return of the egg.

63
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:21,220
That's the only thing I'm going to say. The egg. Best worst character ever.

64
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,470
All right, what's this? The Emperor. All right. Forget what you do, but that's all right.

65
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,090
You know, I'm actually one of those people that really liked Meet the Pyro.

66
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,529
A lot of people liked it, but a lot of people really didn't like it either.

67
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,789
I'll tell you one thing, though. I think Meet the Pyro was too short. If there's one complaint I

68
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:54,440
have about Meet the Pyro, it was too short. Because, I mean, they gave us Meet the Spy,

69
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,759
which was like three and a half minutes. Then they gave us Meet the Medic, which was like

70
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,919
four minutes. And then it's like, oh man, they're getting crazier and crazier. Like,

71
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:07,639
more cinematic and more cinematic as they go. And then Meet the Pyro was like two minutes and

72
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:17,419
22 seconds. That's the only complaint I have. Now I teleport you to the boss room. Good to know.

73
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:28,620
Good to know. Am I? All right, I must be crazy. I have another spirit heart. Did I walk over one

74
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,559
and just not even pay attention? Or do you, every time you kill like 20 people at Samson,

75
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:44,549
you get a spirit heart? Maybe I'm just crazy. But I mean, after the interview, I think they

76
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:48,519
could have done the interview stuff a little bit longer. You know, when the spy's like,

77
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,080
what kind of inhumane, just horrible, disgusting thoughts, or whatever he says.

78
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
If they fleshed that out a little bit more, maybe get a couple more characters,

79
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,970
like get the sniper to say some stuff. Let's do it. I'm not going in that room.

80
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:17,769
They blew the budget on the special effects. Get away from me. This guy's gonna be hard to kill

81
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:26,090
with this spoon. It's gonna, oh no, it's gonna like attack the things around him and not him.

82
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:35,480
It's all right. I can wait it out. I'm also glad that the Pyro's gender is a secret to the couple

83
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,120
of you guys that are saying that right now. I don't know. When you have a mystery like that,

84
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,580
you got to keep it a mystery. It's just like when you read a book,

85
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,139
right? If I read a book, and it's like, you don't know what the character looks like,

86
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,779
you get to make up your own kind of version of the character. Because everybody has their own Pyro.

87
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:00,820
I mean, and I'll bring up a friend of mine, Boo. You guys know Boo. Boo has like the best

88
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,460
perfect description of the Pyro. It's just like a cute, just like cuddly little entity that runs

89
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,179
around and just has fun. Like that there is no man or woman. It's just the Pyro. I think that's

90
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:29,419
perfect. The Pyro is not a man or a woman. It is a thing. It's just a mindset. It's an entity. Okay,

91
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:41,179
I'm absolutely not doing either of those. Ew, who reads books? I not miss. I gotta go. I gotta go

92
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:54,860
down. I would use the Source Filmmaker if I had any idea how to use it. The Source Filmmaker is

93
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,700
one of those things where you really have to sit down and like play with it and be good with it and

94
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:06,919
learn. And artistically, I was never really like an art student. I mean, I can, I went to school for

95
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,759
film. I could probably use it. I could probably like do like shots with it and stuff. But once

96
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:19,000
you get to the animation part of things, there's no way I would ever know what to do with that

97
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,799
program. Because I've tried Garry's mod, even just like do little dumb animations and little

98
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:29,960
dumb things in Garry's mod. And they always end up as complete atrocities. Like complete,

99
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,200
like just horrible things. Like, oh, I want to get like the heavy to smile and point his finger.

100
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,080
And he just ends up going like, oh, get it. Like his hand comes up. I'm just not good with art.

101
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:54,419
Wish I was though. Mini greed. Oh no, please don't kill me. Wow. Wow. I was going to say it.

102
00:13:54,419 --> 00:14:01,399
There's no way I'm that lucky to dodge like five of the cut. Oh my God. Now I'm just being an idiot.

103
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:19,029
It's these stupid things that are in the way. Supposed to have homing shots. Come on now.

104
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:27,379
Oh, I hate epic hack. I absolutely hate epic hack, but I'm going to take it. I really don't

105
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:33,210
like epic hack and it's probably going to kill me. But you know what? I'm going to take it.

106
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:42,580
Let's see if I can find the secret room. Is this a full heart up here? Okay, there's two. Good to know.

107
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:55,669
Oh no, no, no, it's homing too. Oh my God, I forgot about that. Oh man, this is bad. This is

108
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:05,240
really bad. This is really bad. I'm going to kill myself with this. Guaranteed because it's homing.

109
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:27,960
Oh no. Oh no. I'm blowing this up. Cool. Yeah, this is definitely a run that is in the tank,

110
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:36,649
in my opinion. There's just no way I'm going to do this because it's homing. I will open you though.

111
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:56,679
Oh, it's over. Oh, and it's over. I'm getting out of here. I can't believe I survived that.

112
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,639
The only thing this is going to be good for is bosses. That's it. Barely, barely that.

113
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,340
Boom. What did I have for dinner last night? I think I had a chicken sandwich.

114
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:28,950
Pretty sure. Oh wow. I can't believe I got hit by that.

115
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,830
Hmm. This is taking so much longer because I have to keep going back and healing myself.

116
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:45,960
No super secret room there. Super secret room is probably all the way to the right,

117
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:58,299
if there is one here. Oh God. Super wrath, huh? I don't think I've never faced super wrath.

118
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:07,589
Oh no, he does not do that. He does troll bombs, like the big ones that follow you.

119
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:18,869
I guess it doesn't really matter because he's dead. Blast damage. Does blast damage incorporate

120
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:32,099
epic hack shots? Oh, I hope so. Why am I not watching the soccer finals? I'm not a big soccer

121
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:42,490
guy. I never really was. I grew up on baseball. Baseball is my thing. Versus peep. Oh, well,

122
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:51,930
this might be like good. Maybe I'll like kill him easily with this epic hack. Oh God. Yeah,

123
00:17:52,490 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm gonna be good. I'll be good to go. Epic hack. Oh God. Boink. I'll take the tears up,

124
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:21,029
even though I don't really want it. And let's go. Yeah, I'm definitely dead soon. I am absolutely

125
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:29,559
dead soon. Oh, screw you. You aren't getting any of my hearts. You aren't getting my heart.

126
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,539
Actually, that's not that bad as long as you stay away from it. Favorite baseball team is the Boston

127
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:57,460
Red Sox. I live in Boston, so I don't live in Boston. I live right next to it. We'll put it

128
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:14,660
that way. Boing. Get smashed. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. I can't shoot this. Come on. Oh, come on.

129
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:28,099
This is the worst. This is the worst. This is the worst thing. Ah. What's this? Poison bombs. Cool.

130
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:37,769
Well, I think this is the end of Sampson. Let's find out. Unless I get a heart right here. The sun.

131
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:45,529
Okay. I'm gonna stay alive. What's in this next room? Goodbye. Sorry. I was not dealing with that.

132
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:58,380
Not a chance. I'm probably not gonna do a GTA 4 let's play or a walkthrough. GTA 5, though.

133
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:05,500
I will probably do a some type of walkthrough. Maybe a let's play or something, because I love

134
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:17,059
GTA games so much. I can't shoot that. Go in here. Of course it's greed. Wilds wouldn't be anybody

135
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:26,890
else but greed. At least it's a steam sale. Mike Lowell is my favorite Red Sox player of all time.

136
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:51,430
Mike Lowell. Epic hack. You are the worst. Oh, I want that. It's good for those guys. I will

137
00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:15,579
say that for sure. Okay. No. No. No. No. Get away. Good. I'm stuck. Get. I can't hit these bugs.

138
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:35,319
Strike one. Strike two. Strike three. Strike four. Okay. There we go. All right, boss. I am

139
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:41,559
shocked that I've gotten this far. I am like legitimately shocked. You know, we're gonna do

140
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:48,980
this. Ready? Hey, what's going on? What's going on, buddy? How you doing? You want like some of my

141
00:21:48,980 --> 00:22:00,630
hots? Eat this! I missed. Eat this! Run. Who's talking to me? I'm getting tweets all over the place.

142
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:10,680
All right, let's fight this guy. Oh, fantastic. Well, it was nice knowing you guys. I'm sure I'll

143
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:22,069
be like in the afterlife as Samson. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe not. Wow. All right. I'll take that.

144
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:34,759
I'll take a swift victory. Oh, I want. Mommy. Curse of the labyrinth. That's exactly what I wanted.

145
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:44,359
That's. I'm glad. Oh, no. No, boy. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I can't even. I can't even

146
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:54,519
handle this right now. Yeah. Well, now it. Now the jig is up. Unless I pull off some real, real

147
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:01,779
ridiculous moves. I am not doing this. Oh, bombs are key. I actually would rather have that. Thank

148
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:08,630
you. This could be the end right here. I'm going to. I'm going to probably say time to be quiet.

149
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,390
Go to try hard mode and not scream when I die, because that's probably what I'm going to do.

150
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:42,809
All right. OK. As long as you take it slow and steady.

151
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:54,359
Just like the turtle. You don't got to be. You don't got to be the hare. OK, but now. Oh, no.

152
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:16,779
Oh. All right. It hurts every time playing this game. I might want to just go. I don't know.

153
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:32,869
I don't know. I have one heart now. I'll die. I need more stuff. That's not what I needed.

154
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:46,819
I'm afraid to even attempt to get in here. Oh, my. You know, it was going to happen.

155
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,400
I just. I got it. I got it over with. I got over with on purpose.

156
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:09,049
How come that killed me, by the way? I thought it only did. I thought it only did

157
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:20,440
one half heart. Why did I die from that? Oh, whatever. Let's just go straight up,

158
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:35,559
Isaac. Isaac never did me wrong. Samson, you're too hard with your no hearts. I'm going to take

159
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:43,750
this game by the horns with Isaac. Tack fly. That's a good start. I'm going to beat this right

160
00:25:43,750 --> 00:26:00,230
now. You see, that just made me so sad that I'm going to beat this now. The key. All right. All

161
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:13,539
right. OK. Come on, flies. What do you got against Isaac? I'm speaking about those spikes again.

162
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:19,299
I swear that I mean, I had one heart. Why would it do more than one heart worth of damage?

163
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:26,809
Maybe they changed it or maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand. Oh, yeah. Keep throwing

164
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:39,259
your bugs at me and then you run them over yourself. Hi, Zach. Hi, Zach. Actually, I'd rather

165
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:50,200
stay up here keeping from moving around so much. Whoa. Wow. There you go. Kill your own dudes.

166
00:26:50,759 --> 00:27:02,470
That's what I like to say. Now, that's what I like to say, son. Not that, though. Get away.

167
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:17,349
Whoa. Dodging bullets here. You can hit me. You can do better than that. Oh, you could do better

168
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:31,589
than that. Cuban meat. Jump. I'm smoking this game. I'm going to smoke this whole game right now

169
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:50,940
as the title character as Isaac. Screw that thing. I don't want it. I wish they would come out with

170
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:58,140
Binding of Isaac 2 and have it be like not single player. Have it be you can have more than one or

171
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,980
two people in the game. Oh, probably two. More than more than two would be ridiculous.

172
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:19,819
All right, let's go. Cupcake. You velvet cupcake batter. Speed and range up. And I look like a

173
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:35,190
freaking psycho. Yeah. Nickel. All right. Got a nickel. Good to go. Let's go, you uncooked chicken.

174
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:47,819
You can't kill me. I think Abu was telling me that he 100% of this game, which like that's

175
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:57,420
incredible. What a boss. It's not an easy feat to complete like everything in this game.

176
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:05,779
Really isn't. See, I use it on the secret room, which is probably right here.

177
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,289
Well, apparently it wasn't right there. Probably was down this hall somewhere.

178
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:27,349
But you know, I can take it. Whatever. My favorite holiday is definitely

179
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:34,299
Halloween. I love Halloween more than anything. It's the only time of the year where you are

180
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:42,569
allowed to be a freak show and like nobody cares or gets mad. Think of any other night

181
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:50,730
the entire year where you are allowed to hang out your car window as the Joker and scream and laugh

182
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:55,049
at random like old people on the street. When can you do that? And people will just go, oh,

183
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:05,980
he's just being fun. There's not another time in the world where you can do that.

184
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:22,410
Oh, you're going to curve your bullets too, huh? Curve the bullets. Angelina Jolie. That's every

185
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:37,940
day for me, mad killer. Or the Dark Knight premiere. I guess that is the situation where

186
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,940
you couldn't do that. Oh, welcome to the Dark Knight premiere. Oh, okay. You can be the Joker

187
00:30:44,940 --> 00:31:00,809
and like scream at people. That's awesome. Man, I kind of feel like an ice cream cone right now.

188
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:17,259
I feel like a big ice cream cone. Oh, these guys aren't that bad. I can handle these guys.

189
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:25,930
I can handle these two dudes. Oh, if you're wondering if someone was asking about Team Fortress

190
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:32,089
and how come I'm not streaming it or anything, I'm still waiting for a fix. And I think

191
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:37,769
there's a beta driver right now for the 670 or the 600 series in general. I'm going to download that

192
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:42,970
and try it. It's just I didn't want to spend like an hour or two troubleshooting when I was already

193
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,769
like an hour late to the stream anyways. So next week we will see what happens with that.

194
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:58,019
But for right now, Larry Jr., you're dead and you're not coming back as much as you want to.

195
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:03,160
I'm sorry. As much as you want to be in your like fruit punch pool.

196
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,539
See, this is looking more and more like a clean run every single time.

197
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:33,690
Let's go. Four hearts, full. I got no Samsonite to worry about. You need to die. Man, you are a

198
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:39,980
persistent son of a... I kept hitting that guy in the face and he just kept going like...

199
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:57,160
He's like, get out of my face, man. Get out of my face. Do I play MMOs? Absolutely. I played World

200
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:06,279
of Warcraft for over six years. I had multiple max level characters. My main was a warlock. Well,

201
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:18,730
actually let me rephrase that. Warrior. Then it was a priest and then it was a warlock and my

202
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:26,950
main was the warlock for the most amount of time. But I had a priest, warrior, warlock, druid. God,

203
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:36,970
I had everything in that game. But then they did a bunch of weird changes. I don't know why.

204
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:42,809
They did a lot of changes. Oh, it's lagging right now? Stream's lagging? What's going on here?

205
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:57,000
Are we good? I hope so. It just popped up. Everybody was like, lag, lag, lag.

206
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,859
Ah! Like my stream is on fire right now. So apparently my stream is like in flames.

207
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:14,230
Try refreshing it. Try refreshing it up. Let's see. Hold on. Let's see. Just to make sure I...

208
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,699
Because a lot of you guys were just saying that it was lagging. Let's take a look here.

209
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:40,219
Look at my stream health to make sure it's okay. Events. I have control room. Because it'll tell

210
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,820
you. It'll be like, oh, your stream is lagging like crazy. It says it's okay.

211
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,980
So it seems better now. All right. That's good. That's a good thing. All right. Well,

212
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:09,960
I apologize about that. Sorry. Somebody just like rolled over and like tripped over my stream

213
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:20,360
cord at YouTube somewhere. And then I had to plug it back in real quick. Somebody was eating a

214
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,960
sandwich and they just like tripped and ripped out my stream cord.

215
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,239
If you're still getting the lag, try and refresh. Sometimes that fixes it.

216
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:50,250
Shouldn't be happening to begin with though. My favorite superhero is...

217
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:59,539
Ah, that is a tough question because there are a lot. There are a lot that I could say.

218
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,139
Oh my god, this room is full of bugs.

219
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:20,949
Man, I don't want to say like, oh, Batman, because it really isn't Batman. Or Superman. Or...

220
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:31,960
What is his name? I should be able to answer this question in three seconds. I don't know why I

221
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,619
can't answer this. Superhero. Superhero. Oh, Deadpool. Deadpool. There you go. Probably

222
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:46,500
Deadpool. Deadpool or Venom. That took me a long time to say that. Oh, I need more coins.

223
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:54,219
ASAP. I'm going to buy this bomb and try to blow up the secret room. See if it's right here.

224
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,639
But Venom is just such a cool character. I love the way like he is. He just is Venom.

225
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:10,119
No, that was the wrong place. It was up top. All right, whatever. Let's a go.

226
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:22,489
Gertie. I actually like facing Gertie. I can handle him. I can handle Gertie. Gertie, come on.

227
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:30,940
Dodge. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I did not dodge that right at all. There we go. Oh, you're too like

228
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:42,420
bubbles of puke. Gotta get rid of those bubbles of puke. I know in Deadpool, because the Deadpool

229
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,900
comics, if you ever read them, he is insane. He breaks the fourth wall all the time. He'll

230
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,420
just be like, hey, reader, if you want to like skip this part, go ahead and like go to page 14.

231
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:58,019
This part's like pretty boring. I just talked to some broad for like five minutes. I love how

232
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:06,300
much he breaks the fourth wall in the Deadpool comics. It's so funny. All right, Gertie,

233
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,940
that's just about enough of you and your like big smelly body. Oh, come on. You're gonna do

234
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:20,780
me like that, Gertie. I keep thinking that eye is not mine and that happens every time.

235
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:32,739
Do it again. Come on, do it again. I dare you. I dare you. Oh, he missed. You're stupid.

236
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:47,460
Go. The caves. Welcome to the caves. But down here, you never see the light of day again.

237
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:06,329
And you almost die from walking into things. What you know, Isaac. I actually, when Vindictus

238
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:13,349
first came out, I was, it's free to play, right? I actually was going to download that and I just

239
00:39:13,429 --> 00:39:19,539
forgot to do it. So thank you for reminding me because I'm going to go download Vindictus

240
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:24,489
like right after the stream is done. That's the one where it's like an MMO, but it's like a hack

241
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:31,079
and slash kind of like third person. That's the right game I'm thinking of, right? I'll take that

242
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:43,059
money. Go ahead, blow up. I'll take that money. It's going here. Now, what do you have for me?

243
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:48,260
If you don't have, if I don't win this on the first time, you are dying just to let you know.

244
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:53,260
All right. I know you heard me. Do you want to stay alive? We'll find out.

245
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,500
Oh, it looks like somebody wants to get blown up. No, please. No, please. Yeah. Couldn't even

246
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:14,489
finish your sentence. And that's enough of that. Yeah. Definitely downloading Vindictus

247
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:26,460
at the end of this stream. And I'm going to play it a bunch. Oh, you turned into like a little

248
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:36,869
piece of jello. I feel bad for you. I'm doing it. No, it wasn't worth it for like the seventh time

249
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:49,429
in a row. It's never worth it. Me and MLC Stealth played DC Universe for a little while.

250
00:40:50,070 --> 00:41:03,030
We played for like a few hours at least. A few. Oh, I'm cracking my back. Hours at least. Of

251
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:13,960
course it's greed. Of course it's greed. Why would it be anybody else besides greed? Get him, eyeball.

252
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:26,230
Show him that. So I just realized something. I am shooting a red tier every other tier. Is that

253
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:39,300
because my eye came out? Yeah, it has to be, right? Greed, you bastard. Why don't you go bottle like

254
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,789
Edward Elric? Like, leave me alone. Never mind. You dropped a lot of money. I like you, now.

255
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:56,840
What am I doing standing there? I need to be in the corner. I need to be in the rear view. There

256
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:07,670
we go. Don't even need to do that. Uh oh, it's super toothless Joe, whatever his name is.

257
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:21,780
These guys freak me out. These guys are scary. I've had all the Warhammer games for a pretty long

258
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:31,590
time. If you are a fan of RTS, I would highly recommend you get the original Dawn of War.

259
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:38,780
I wasn't a fan of Dawn of War 2. I'm not gonna lie. I thought Dawn of War 2 was a good game,

260
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:47,590
but I don't think it was nearly as good as Dawn of War 1. Just quit following me, dude. Come on.

261
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:55,269
Come right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. I've got like candy and soda and chips. You know what?

262
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:59,690
You're not gonna come down, so I'm just gonna kill you. We're gonna have a party down there,

263
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:13,050
but you like didn't feel like coming. That makes me sad. How much fur? There we go. There it is.

264
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,590
Item room is all the way over there. After this, I'm gonna have to go do that. Get to the item room.

265
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:33,820
After all these like toothless freaks. There we go. Speaking of Left 4 Dead 2,

266
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,019
someone just said Left 4 Dead 2. Didn't they come out with a new map? Coldstream?

267
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,349
Or Coldland or something? Because whatever it is, I'm definitely gonna be playing a lot of that, too.

268
00:43:47,300 --> 00:44:00,469
Fork. Isaac's Fork. Okay. Oh, if you're gonna come to the party, you gotta bring like salsa.

269
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:07,900
You gotta bring dip, chips, soda, burger patties, frozen hot dogs,

270
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,369
a love for life, and a good attitude. That's the only way you're allowed my party.

271
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:35,219
You sack of marbles. Get out of here. Open. Open. Now open again. I'm the dentist,

272
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,739
and your teeth need a real cleaning.

273
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:54,820
Where's this item room? God, such a big level. This is dumb. Oh my goodness, will you just...

274
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,059
I need to damage up something because it's taking forever to kill any of these things.

275
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:10,019
Open. Open. Yeah, once it comes out, I'll stream Left 4 Dead 2. Once the new map comes out. Open.

276
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:23,110
Come on. I didn't even kill him. My little buddy did. Ooh, little Chad. He's so happy.

277
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:33,340
Hi, I'm Bill Chad. I'm gonna drop hearts for you. Thanks, little Chad. No problem. So little Chad,

278
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:39,940
you're gonna like tell me your life story. Okay, so I grew up in the sewer and then I pooped out

279
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:45,380
hearts. That's a touching story, Chad. Thank you. Now give me your hearts before I kill myself

280
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:51,880
because I'm pretending to be two people. Okay. Well, that's a good way to lose three hearts.

281
00:45:51,880 --> 00:46:05,219
Do a little Chad movie. Pills here. No, no. That's the worst. That's the last thing I wanted.

282
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:14,420
There is a circus following me right now. Look at this.

283
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:27,260
It's like all I need now is a brother Bobby and like more attack flies and I'll be all set.

284
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:43,480
Hopefully I don't die. Oh, Chad. Oh, no. Why is he so weak? Or did it? Was that my...

285
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:53,190
What just even hurt him? I didn't do that. Hopefully he doesn't kill me. All right. Little

286
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:59,989
Chad and big Chad. This is like very surreal. He's fighting his like daddy right now. This is like

287
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:15,909
weird. Whose side are you on, son? I stand on the side of light. What's in here? I'm actually kind

288
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:23,449
of tempted to take this because I could use the spirit hearts. I think I'm going to take that.

289
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:30,489
I really think I'm going to take this right now. Oh, I'm going to take it. I'm going to take it.

290
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:42,840
I took it. Thank you. It was a decision I had to make and I made it. I needed it. Oh, God.

291
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:50,730
I'm like, why is it crashing? What? What? Oh, for a second there, I thought the game was just

292
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:56,650
crashed and done. I was just about to freak out. Did my stream die? We're still streaming,

293
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:09,769
right? Okay. You guys saw that. It was just like, you know what? We might even do it again

294
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:23,980
at some point if I need it. Oh, pro dodges right there. Pro dodging. I wish there wasn't all these

295
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:33,539
obstacles in the way so I could hit them. Oh, that was, that thing was blocking it. That was why.

296
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:46,300
Give me this. Give me that. And I'm going to blow this up for sure. Good position now. Too bad I have

297
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:52,619
stupid curse of the labyrinth. Whatever this dumb thing does. Makes it so I can't see anything.

298
00:48:55,989 --> 00:49:01,619
Oh, I want to kill at least mom. I want to kill mom. That big fat...

299
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:17,530
Ugh. There we go. Let's go down. I just did this room, man. I just did this room. Okay,

300
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:28,260
I'm going the other way. I'm going around. Ugh. There's too much stuff blocking you for me to

301
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:37,800
shoot you. See, if I didn't take that guppy's hand and I didn't use it, I probably would be dead right

302
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:49,820
now. Because I've been hit at least at least five or six times. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is really

303
00:49:49,820 --> 00:50:01,019
bad. Especially this room. Don't spawn anymore. No. No. Get... Ugh. God. I hate spiders. Not only

304
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:23,269
in real life, but in fake life too. It's a good thing to take. Guppy. Die. Oh, you hairy...

305
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:28,630
This is gonna be so hard. I'm just gonna stay in the corner. No sense going out there and

306
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:36,409
meeting my demise like that. Get out of here. Oh, no. Corner's a bad move.

307
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,909
There has to be this many things in this room. Get out of here, you ba-bomb.

308
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:01,659
There's so many of these little guys that shoot. I hate those ones. I actually just

309
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:09,719
tried the Samson run. Didn't really work out too well. I got to, like, what, the third or fourth

310
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:27,690
run when I died? Ugh. I don't want any of your, like, cream cheese. Get out of here. This is the

311
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:36,280
binding of Isaac. Wrath of the Lamb. DLC. And this is me getting stuck and not being able to... Oh,

312
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,800
my God. I had to use it. I had to do that. You guys all saw it. I had to do that. I might even

313
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,300
have to do it again. I'm gonna have to do it again. I'm gonna have to do it again. I'm probably

314
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:55,960
gonna have to do it again. Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to do it again. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.

315
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:16,599
There's nowhere for me to go. Oh, there was nowhere for me to go. Oh, my God. Ugh. There was

316
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:25,289
literally nothing I could do right there besides just get hit a million times. Oh, now it is

317
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:36,230
definitely over. Oh, these... Come on. Okay, well, that's gonna be the end of this run. Hopefully,

318
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:41,429
you enjoyed this. Have fun in whatever you're gonna do and however you... What path you take

319
00:52:41,429 --> 00:53:02,219
in your life. I'm silent. God. Ugh. That was the worst possible thing that could have happened.

320
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:13,559
Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. Nowhere to go. They were, like, engulfing me.

321
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:40,570
Ugh. Gosh, darn it. Well, that's... So now you know what's gonna happen is grandpa's gonna play as

322
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:44,010
question mark, question mark, question mark, and that's gonna be the end of the stream.

323
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:49,980
So I'm gonna go get grandpa. Grandpa can come in and he'll sit down. He'll talk about how he loves

324
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:58,440
this game and we'll see what happens. Hey, grandpa. Hey, you gotta get down here. You gotta play Binding

325
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:07,699
of Isaac right now. No, come... Yeah, come down. You're scaring the dog. Just come down. Okay,

326
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:13,900
let me just get over here. What the hell is this game? What game is this? Binding of Isaac.

327
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:20,489
What's that? Just play it. Just sit down and play. Okay, I'll sit down right here. There we go.

328
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:32,300
Okay. Hello. Let's play Binding of Isaac. What? Did I just eat shit? What the hell was that?

329
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:40,969
All right, so what are the controls in this game? Up, down, left, right. Okay, so here we go. Up,

330
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:52,619
down, left, right. Okay, good. Let's go this way. What's this? That's a spider. This game is stupid.

331
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:59,179
What a dumb game. So, you know what? You just killed spiders and that's it. This is stupid.

332
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:06,010
Why would you ever play this game? Okay, let's keep going. What's that? What the hell?

333
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:15,449
What? Oh, that hurts you. Oh, am I gonna like die? Let's just go. Okay, I'm gonna beat this

334
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:20,650
entire game right now. And let's go. Let's go down. Okay, we're gonna go down here.

335
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,119
Okay, so look, I'm driving like a farm right here. A pet spiders. Okay, hey spiders.

336
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:31,800
So today, we're gonna, I'm gonna feed you some little bugs and you're gonna eat them.

337
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:39,429
Again, I'm gonna shoot that. So how do I, is this like a simulator? How do I get out of here?

338
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:44,360
Oh, one of them escaped. One of the bugs escaped. One of the bugs fucking escaped.

339
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:53,349
That means you die, by the way. If you escape the hole, that means you die, you bastard. See,

340
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:59,800
these guys are locked in here forever. Can you get out now? Come on, try to get down now.

341
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,980
You're not getting anywhere. I'm gonna shoot the shit out of you. You can't even do it.

342
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:10,489
That's it, I got the key. Gonna go in the golden room, the golden palace,

343
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:19,619
and pick up the lazy beam. What? What does this do? Does this just shoot right through people?

344
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:33,860
So what's this button do? Oh, yeah, yeah. Ew. This game is gross. No, I take money. I love the

345
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:40,969
money. I absolutely love money. It's the best thing in the world. Whoa, that was an explosion.

346
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:50,309
We're going down to this room. Okay. Did I miss anything? Do I have to go back up here

347
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:58,139
or southward? What the hell is this? What is this? Do I go this? Oh my god, this guy. What is with

348
00:56:58,139 --> 00:57:03,030
this guy? Can I help you? I'm gonna get him down. I gotta get him down off that rope. He's gonna die.

349
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:14,619
Oh, whatever. Screw you. Let's go down here. And this is the room I need to go in, right?

350
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:24,579
Oh, I have to fight this little worm. So what, do I just... Okay, so how many lives do I get?

351
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,860
What, I get like 10 lives, right? Like two, at least two or three lives, right?

352
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:42,139
What is... Do I have to start this all over again? You don't get lives in this game,

353
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:49,989
is that what you're trying to tell me right now? How come I don't have... This is the stupidest

354
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:56,380
game I've ever played. Why would you... This is the dumbest... You know what? I'm not gonna do

355
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:01,659
anything. I'm going right back to that same boss. That worm son of a bitch is going down right now.

356
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:11,480
Hey, worm! He's a different guy. Why is he... Where's the worm? The worm would look a lot easier

357
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:19,590
than this guy. What is... Is this whole game just like randomly generated? This is stupid.

358
00:58:20,389 --> 00:58:25,059
I'm gonna like punch him in the face. I'll punch you! I'm gonna punch you right in your face.

359
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:28,820
You see, that's how you do it. That's a pro tip right there. See all those bugs that were around

360
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,059
him? They're not there anymore, are they? See, I'll do it again. Get rid of all the stupid goddamn

361
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,539
bugs. And that's how you win. That's how you beat this. And then you poo on them too. And that's

362
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:51,110
how you get the most massive points. Concentrate. Concentrate. Need to concentrate! Oh, I don't have

363
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:57,260
enough life to do the bug move again. I don't have enough life to do the bug move. And you know what?

364
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:02,380
He's almost dead. I'm gonna beat the game. I just beat the game. I just beat the game.

365
00:59:04,099 --> 00:59:13,849
I just beat the game. This game's supposed to be hard. We're doing it again. We're going to do it

366
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:29,139
again. Go. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. This game is stupid. See you later. If you play

367
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:35,139
that game, you're a son of a bitch in my opinion. And we're not friends anymore. So I'm getting out

368
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:54,840
of here. Talk to you guys later. Hello? You see, did he die? What happened? Oh, I gotta put these

369
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:05,340
headphones back in. I mean, he still has a heart left. Not like he didn't die completely. Why is

370
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:16,039
he playing as this guy, by the way? All right. Oh, let's salvage the grandpa run. It's gonna be

371
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:32,469
impossible. Oh, poor grandpa. Don't worry, he'll get over it. Grandpa rages all the time. He'll get

372
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:44,760
over it. Ten bombs. And he died three times. Make it four, because I'm probably not going to make

373
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:53,719
it out of this room. Nope. Oh, there's no way. There's no way. Like, there's not a chance.

374
01:00:53,719 --> 01:01:14,710
That's it right there. Well, that's gonna wrap it up, guys. Thanks everybody so much for coming.

375
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:20,300
This will all be on YouTube in the next, like, half an hour or so. So if you missed it from the

376
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:26,059
beginning, didn't really do any good runs, unfortunately. It wasn't a good night for Isaac.

377
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,900
But that's okay. Had fun, regardless. So thanks everybody again for coming so much. You guys all

378
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:41,260
rock and roll. And I will see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody. And let's end the stream.

379
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:50,469
Oh, and grandpa just says goodbye, too, and that he loves you all. Right, grandpa? Oh, he's coming

380
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:58,860
in here. Hold on. Grandpa, get in. You need to apologize to these people. Apologize to anybody.

381
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:09,449
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You know, rage takes over us all. And the game was just a little

382
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:19,929
too hard. But I love everybody. I hope you guys have a fantastic Sunday and love grandpa. And

383
01:02:19,929 --> 01:02:26,260
goodbye. That's the end. Bye. Now, we're gonna eat in like 10 minutes. You gotta come up here,

384
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,739
Jeremy. Come on, let's go. And bring your dog, too. I'm gonna feed him.

385
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:40,440
All right. See you later. So that's gonna be the end, guys. Thanks a lot for watching. I really

386
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,880
do appreciate it. And of course, again, take care, everybody.
