00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:12,820
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,239
Gonna be playing on Harvest, just casually playing some Sniper.

3
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,239
Try to shave some people's heads down a size.

4
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,059
I love Harvest, you all know that.

5
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:29,109
Where the hell is everybody? Am I gonna have to go like Super Secret Sniper?

6
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:37,619
Let's go. Watch your head. Watch your head. That's a two piece double cheeseburger.

7
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:44,619
I'm actually very, very tired right now. So anytime I play Sniper, if I'm really, really tired, I can do very, very well.

8
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,179
I don't know why. I think it's because... Ah, there's a spy.

9
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:54,179
I think it's because I just relax a whole lot more than if I was, you know, stressed out and trying to get headshots and stuff.

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,179
But I just, you know, just... Who cares? Let's just play. Who cares?

11
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:07,760
Ready? Ready? Come on out. Come on out and meet your maker. Anybody. Any second now. Any... I missed.

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,959
Right here. Pyro.

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,329
Are we gonna win? Oh, we did it. Good thing I was here for the whole round. Let's do another one.

14
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:28,319
Try to win Shiv, huh? Let's go in the spawn and just like smash, smash, smash.

15
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:35,019
Uh oh. I ran out of coffee. Trying to keep myself awake and I just completely ran out of coffee.

16
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,019
That can't happen for a Jerma video.

17
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,019
There has to be a full coffee here at all times, ready to go down my throat, into my stomach, into my brain.

18
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,019
And let's do it, baby.

19
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:49,060
A zoo.

20
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:59,980
Oh, heavy. If you didn't have crits, I would have killed you. I still might.

21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,540
Oh, sneaky little snake.

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,490
And that's how you snipe somebody's skullcap off. You're real. Let's get it again.

23
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,979
That is... That's a spy. You are def... You are not a real Pyro. I do... Yeah, I knew it. I could tell. I could tell.

24
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,479
Neither are you. You're not real either and I just keep missing these spies.

25
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,939
I love that hat, by the way. That Antla hat that that engineer has on right now. I love that thing.

26
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,240
That's like one of my favorite hats.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,759
What is it? Merasmus's hat, I think is what it is.

28
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:42,289
This is a very bad spot for me to be right now. Very... Oh, damn it.

29
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:48,610
Come on. What's going on, y'all?

30
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:57,270
I'll take it. I'll take it. Oh, no. I'll get this guy. I'll get this guy. I'll get this guy.

31
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,849
I backed up right into that. How many people are in this server? There's plenty of people in here.

32
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:13,539
There's at least like two dozen people in here. Oh, no, there's not. Two dozen is 24. Right. Yes, Roger.

33
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:20,460
All right. Let's get some more kills. I got to make sure... No. Spy behind you. I got to kill him before he kills him.

34
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,169
Oh, he... Oh, he got the... He must have got... No, he didn't.

35
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:32,020
You? Spies everywhere. And who's behind me? You little prick. Come here.

36
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:39,590
Oh, thank God, Heavy, you just saved my life. All right. I need to get my head on straight here.

37
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:55,490
I'm gonna die. Get my head on straight. Don't get backstabbed. Right as I said it. Right as I said it, I got backstabbed.

38
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,659
All right. You know what? Am I going to do this right now? I think I'm putting on the Razorback.

39
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:10,060
It's time for the Razorback to go on, bros. Backing up into spies, backing up into knives. This started off pretty well.

40
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:19,540
No. No. He's not dead. Make sure he stays dead. Is it... Is their team just spies and pyros? What's going on here?

41
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:26,370
All right. We got the point. That's a good thing. Oh, you...

42
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:35,870
Stay in sniper. I'm going to stay sniper on principle. This is a long respawn. Holy shoot. That's like an 18, 17 second respawn.

43
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:46,279
I've only killed four people. All right. Let's pull this out here. I got to get some more headshots. Let's go.

44
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:57,970
We're going to win this. How are we winning right now? There we go. You stay still. But there's a spy somewhere.

45
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:08,610
Somewhere over the rainbow way.

46
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,660
I'm like singing karaoke. How did I not hit him? I was going to say it. I hit that guy right in his mouth.

47
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:37,620
That too. I should have hit that guy right in his face. God damn it. Oh, hey. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't get me that time, spy.

48
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:52,920
I hit Razorback ranked up. What's a level one? Yeah. Oh, I got him in midair. Did I? I don't even know. Where's he going? Where's he going?

49
00:05:52,920 --> 00:06:01,550
Hey, that guy was... That engineer. Wow. EngineerGG. We got time for one more? I think we got time for one more. Why not?

50
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,980
All right. Well, we have changed maps to Nucleus. How are we going to end this? I'm going to give myself three lives right here.

51
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:17,490
Three lives to do as much damage and as much offensive power as I possibly can. I might not even do anything. We might just win the match.

52
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:31,730
Let's see. Oh, looking for someone like this scout. Where is he going? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This spy is so dead. Maybe not.

53
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:38,720
He's going to kill me. No, he's definitely not dead. There's no way. I hit him like in the shoulder blade. Whoa. Who's on that point?

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:47,220
Oh, I got him in the head. Didn't matter. I can't. I can't shoot with this thing. Oh, that was so lucky. You cannot shoot from the hip with that damn thing.

55
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:57,759
Why did I pick it? Well, because it's awesome. That's why. That's why. Bro, you are. Are you kidding me?

56
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,689
He was like sitting up on the ledge. He was like chameleon blending in with the background, too. That was ridiculous.

57
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:13,750
Whatever. That's one. Two more deaths. Maybe we'll win. I'm assuming it'll be like one death per minute. Maybe not.

58
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:31,720
Yeah. You want to dance around? You want to dance? Yeah. I swear I thought that was a spy. Speaking of spies. Oh, man. I can't even shoot anybody.

59
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:46,500
Team is just too good. All right. So anyways, apparently we have the point locked down. Yeah, there's people on the other team.

60
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,910
I think there's just oh, almost fell off the cliff. What? How did that hurt him in the face? I can't believe that.

61
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:06,720
I run that back. He's got one health. That that line went right into in between his eyes.

62
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:16,329
That was a bunch of baloney and cheese sandwiches stuffed underneath like my grandmother's ass. Oh, my God. That was gross.

63
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:24,529
Baloney and cheese. You know, I love baloney and cheese sandwiches, but you have to be in the mood for baloney and cheese sandwiches.

64
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:31,350
Otherwise, it's just gross. Well, this was a completely successful round. I killed like one person.

65
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:38,940
You know what? Just get over here. Get the hell over here. You can shoot me all you want. I'm going to get this. I'm going to get this kill.

66
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:48,230
And this one, too. You know what? Oh, no, he's got a big sword. Your sword's way bigger than mine. All right. Well, that's three.

67
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:55,419
You know what? We'll wait till the end because we're about to win right now for as well as my team is doing.

68
00:08:55,419 --> 00:09:06,679
I haven't really done anything. I just be kind of just sitting around like a real freak. Here we go.

69
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:18,970
Twelve seconds. I got to get an epic headshot right here. Epic headshot. No, this has just been like me versus but you know what?

70
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:28,129
I got an epic headshot right here. Didn't get it. Just might as well jump off the cliff over time over time.

71
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:33,429
Hey, I know you got like your camping gear. Look at this guy's just like opening and closing the gate over and over again.

72
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:38,429
I think you have enough ammo and health. I think you don't know. Stop. Stop opening that. You don't need any more.

73
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,610
Look, you got to save the rest for the rest of the damn team. There's rations in there. You're eating them all.

74
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,059
Anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.

75
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:53,059
Facecam Fortress 2, Sniper, Tire, Jerma for the loss or for the win. I'm not really sure, but I'll see you guys all soon.

76
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,059
And of course, take care, everybody.
