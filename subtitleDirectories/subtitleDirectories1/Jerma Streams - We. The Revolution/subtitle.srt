00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:11,830
Hello everybody. I've been away for a little while. Just returned. I had a nice entertaining

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:23,140
four days. I got to hang out with a close friend. It was very, very, very cool. It's the first time

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,980
I've seen anybody from back in Massachusetts in almost six months. So that was great.

4
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:41,060
And I have, since the last four days, have developed a cough. Kim got sick.

5
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:48,020
She got a cough, a cold, and passed it along to me. So I'm gonna have to be muting. It's

6
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,460
not bad. I'm fine. But I'm gonna have to mute every so often to cough into a tissue.

7
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,399
So quarantine him already, yeah. But hopefully you guys have been doing well.

8
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:13,980
You are going to see another one of these four to plus day breaks again sooner than you think.

9
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,299
And I'm sorry that these are kind of all compound on top of each other. But apparently

10
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,659
like springs the time to come visit me. My mother is coming up to visit as well. But

11
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:31,260
that's not until, that's not like another month. But still I'll be taking another probably

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,379
four or five days off when mom comes up. So I just want to make you aware of that now.

13
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,950
Speaking of other things to plan and get ready for. What's tomorrow? Something going on tomorrow,

14
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:50,180
right? A video game that I have been looking forward to for years by a company whose video

15
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,730
games I've played for years. And I'm talking all the way back to the original King's Field.

16
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:05,480
I beat that game. I don't even talk about that. But Sekiro comes out tomorrow. And yes,

17
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,460
I know that there's like 200 million people watching it right now on streams. But I don't

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,849
have access to the game. I don't have like an early deal or something. So I'm just going to

19
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:25,500
get it. I'm going to play it when it comes up. It's already preloaded sitting in my steam

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:34,969
inventory. Inventory inventory inventory. It's going to be an amazing horrible time for you.

21
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:39,849
Sorry in advance. I'm looking forward to it. I love and this is the best part about a

22
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,969
brand new From Software game. Everybody in the chat is, you can't talk shit to me.

23
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,610
You can't because you don't know either. You know, there's no Wikipedia page with like

24
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,770
5,000 articles about, oh, this is the best thing to do. This is where you go here. Nope.

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:02,650
Nobody has any idea. You're going to be just as lost as I am. I love it. I don't have to

26
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:18,020
know in order to talk shit. That's true. That's true. You are correct. He's dying.

27
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,419
No, I told you I got a cough. It's just annoying. It doesn't hurt or anything.

28
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,860
But so I'm going to give you a plan. Let's go over the plan of action here.

29
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,979
So today is we're going to play this game called We The Revolution. It's a game that was

30
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,860
inspired by Papers, Please. It's a game where you have to admit you're a judge

31
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,500
and you're presented with cases and you either send people to the guillotine,

32
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:54,300
you acquit them, or you put them in jail. And you got to be careful because there's a lot of

33
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,500
crazy shit that can happen. Fighting in nations and political powers rising. It looked

34
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,099
interesting just to play because I didn't want to start something elaborate because tomorrow

35
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,900
I'm going to be streaming all day. Tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, I'm going to, I'm going to

36
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,819
play that game a shitload. So I figured let's just do something for a little while so I can

37
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:24,019
prepare my body for the inevitable like 30 plus hours of streaming I'm going to do over

38
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:38,149
the next like two and a half days, right? After Sekiro, when Sekiro is done, or maybe

39
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:44,870
even to take a break from Sekiro, Monster Rancher 4 is the next thing. Because I

40
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,180
want to go back to play it. I want to play Monster Rancher 2. Monster Rancher 4 was when

41
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:59,399
we didn't try. And that's what's going to happen later on this coming week. There's also other

42
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:06,550
collaborative things, collabs with other people, that are still kind of floating around. Maybe

43
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,540
we'll get a new Beanbag Sonic. Possibly, yeah. But for now, for today, we're just going to

44
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,319
chill. I just got back, I have to be completely honest. I didn't really look at anything. I

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,600
haven't been planning any streams or anything for the last four days. I've just been hanging

46
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,060
out with friends. So I kind of just have what am I going to do today, right? This is what we're

47
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:38,730
going to do. Let's go ahead and open it up. Again, this is called We The Revolution. And

48
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:48,300
there it is on your screen. Do a collab with Quaker Oatman. What is it? What do you do?

49
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:55,420
The guy on the on like the cereal box? You're talking about George Washington, right?

50
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,319
I thought that was George Washington for like the first 30 years of my life.

51
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,079
It is George Washington, isn't it? Is it? Who is on the front of the Quaker Oats?

52
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:24,600
Wait, no, no, no, for real. Who? Who's on the Quaker Oats box? The Quaker man is not an actual

53
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,480
person. His image is that of a man dressed in the Quaker garb chosen because the Quaker faith.

54
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,870
Wait, that's not supposed to be George Washington. Well, I knew it wasn't George

55
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:44,360
Washington. I just want to make sure you knew. I got to turn this down. This is loud.

56
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,420
No, I knew it wasn't George Washington. I'm just fucking around. All right, new profile.

57
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,259
This game just came out today. So we're going to give it a check. You know that steam review.

58
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:11,379
Let's see. Let's just make sure this is correct. Full screen. Yeah, that's yeah,

59
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,540
let's get a tutorial just because we don't know what the hell we're doing.

60
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:20,060
Game options, audio. I always hate having music. That's something I got to tell.

61
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,620
I got to give some developers a little bit of audio lessons here. You know,

62
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,310
I'm the master of audio. Don't have music be the same volume percentage as sound and voice.

63
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:37,480
This should always be like 30% lower. How many trailers you ever watched where the music was the

64
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,160
same volume as people talking? Music is supposed to be in the background, not in the foreground.

65
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:52,620
Some people even do it like this. That's wrong. If you have people talking and sound effects,

66
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,060
you want the music to be at a decibel much lower because you can hear them talking.

67
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,810
No wonder he didn't like doom. I liked doom. What did I give doom?

68
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:09,319
That's better. Okay, see maybe even a little lower, like 47.

69
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,740
Why did it go to zero? What? Oh, it didn't. Okay, the song ended.

70
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,920
Okay, we the revolution. This is like Ace Attorney. Just imagine playing Ace Attorney

71
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,340
for all of the Ace Attorney fans. I wonder if I'm gonna have to do any voice acting.

72
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,299
Let's see if I can do some voice acting. Oh no, they're gonna be way better than me.

73
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,340
Never mind, I'll just be quiet.

74
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,340
This takes place in the French Revolution, if you didn't know.

75
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Play as Jean Paul Gosseau. He used to own a Marine tank.

76
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:51,610
He was nothing. I am better than he was. People will follow in my footsteps.

77
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,809
I know this factor. Father.

78
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,549
Who is he? That like people will follow him in my footsteps, like I've heard it before.

79
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:15,799
Music's too quiet. I can't hear. The game is louder than me. France, turn off the 18th

80
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:22,789
century. Turn to the 18th century. Prologue. I hope this is a fucking musical.

81
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:31,960
Everything from France is a musical. Has to be. Every piece of media, every TV show, every film.

82
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:57,100
Is he but a puke too? Is that me? All right, so now I get to talk. Remind me next time I

83
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:03,340
want to stop drinking this cloudy rotgut. Remind me before I drink it. We're disgracing

84
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:17,500
Thomas. Is someone coming? This was bound to happen. I told you. Papa, you said we would go.

85
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:26,389
You promised. Papa had a lot of work. Yes, a lot of heavy glasses. You promised me.

86
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:33,299
I can't anymore. I'm fed up with asking. Mama is angry because- Quiet. Today it's hard to

87
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:43,610
do four people at the same time, okay? All different ages. Today your favorite son wanted

88
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,529
to prove he was more honorable than his father, so he started a fight. A five-year-old boy,

89
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:54,179
for God's sake. Our neighbors wanted you to explain that to them, but well,

90
00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:00,259
you were fighting for justice. At an inn, damn you, you bloody drunk. Mama.

91
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,190
Is this kid on trial? Oh, this is like a trial. Okay, hold on.

92
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Drag and drop documents to manage their layout click to display their contents.

93
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:24,009
React to events. Ignoring them may have severe consequences. Okay, so that's events, documents.

94
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,330
Review detailed information about current events, actions, and characters.

95
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:33,990
Okay. Choose- Consider the effects and decide the defendant's fate.

96
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:39,799
And you can change the settings from here. Review the current balance of power in Paris

97
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:46,139
and your position therein. So that's the balance of power. Intrigues are complex conflicts

98
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,100
between you and another political player. A defeat may turn out to be disastrous for you.

99
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,799
This is how many influence points I have of the main currency in the game. Use them wisely.

100
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,759
And then we got like a Sims notification field. Pay close attention to the changes

101
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:09,399
in your influence and relations with factions. Okay. Some of your decisions and changes in the

102
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:14,360
world of the game may cause global modifiers to come into effect. These factors affect

103
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,879
relations, reputation, and influence. You can review them in the notebook.

104
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:28,840
All right, so guilty. No, punishment. Make the most important decision. Condemn the defendant

105
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:37,940
or deem them not guilty. Sign the document to legitimize your verdict. Okay, so choose a

106
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,100
verdict. What if I just say you're guilty? I'm dead, right? All right, so here we go.

107
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,879
Case file. Review charges and facts. This will make it easier for you to unlock questions

108
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:55,240
for the defendant. Okay, so review charges and facts. But where are these the facts?

109
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,500
All right, so case file. This is an assault. Skip this? I'm not gonna skip this. I have to,

110
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,059
what am I gonna go off of like how I feel? We have not expected this kind of behavior from

111
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:18,820
your son, although apparently we should have. Innocent child's play turned into an assault

112
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:27,000
on our children. The younger one, Antoine, now has a chipped front tooth. We hope that

113
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,240
you will punish your child accordingly. Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more

114
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,399
decisive decisively. I am sure we can deal with the gambler and drunkard even if he is a judge.

115
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:44,440
We will not let our children be hurt. Okay, can I click these? We should have. Innocent,

116
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,029
an innocent child's play turned into an assault. Innocent. Finding links. I'm not

117
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:55,179
gonna put my son to the guillotine. Find the correct links to unlock questions for

118
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,940
the defendant. Choose a line of inquiry and link it to the right category.

119
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,769
Okay, what the fuck? While linking lines of inquiry in categories, you can make a limited

120
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:12,330
number of mistakes. If you make too many mistakes, the whole system will become locked.

121
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:23,799
Oh god. And there are traps here too? Some cases may contain traps. Read through the

122
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:30,600
files thoroughly to find the lines of inquiry that are irrelevant. Okay, so child's play.

123
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,500
I thought that you said eating children. I was like, that, where did that come from?

124
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,950
All right, wait, wait, go back, go back, back. Course of events. Wait, wait, hold on,

125
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:48,970
let me look at this. So, innocent child's play turned into an assault. The younger one.

126
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,690
So, Antoine has a chipped front tooth. So, innocent child's play turned into a chipped

127
00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:01,350
front tooth. Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more. So, okay,

128
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:08,740
innocent child's play into a front tooth being chipped. Okay, so let's take a look.

129
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:29,029
Child's play to, all right, so we've got course of events in victim. Wait, this isn't a

130
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:35,259
Jerma game. Yes, it is. All right, this is the victim. Fighting children is the

131
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:44,259
extenuating circumstance. No, no, no, chipped tooth is the extenuating circumstance. Oh, fuck.

132
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,080
That's all right, we have a question. Hold on. Gather information to influence

133
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,320
the jury's attitude. Why is there a jury here? Why am I bringing this? This is what happens when

134
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:06,490
you have a dad judge. All right, this is the embarrassing shit that you have to go through.

135
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:13,640
What exactly were they saying? Okay, who started the fight? To ask questions, you have to first

136
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,880
unlock them in the inquiry linking menu. Okay, being in the jury's good graces allows you to

137
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:26,039
find out which way they will sway after you have asked a question. Okay, so you can sway

138
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:35,049
on home. Let me go back to this. So an injured Anton. So we've got possibility of repeating.

139
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:42,140
We've got fighting children is the that's the course of events. Okay, chipped tooth is also

140
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:50,710
the course of events. All right, that's I get it. All right, what's my son's name? How did

141
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,299
your play turn into a fight? That makes sense. How did your play turn into a fight?

142
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:01,000
Our neighbors, Antoine and Jean, they were saying mean things about you.

143
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,480
We were playing guards and they asked me to pretend to be a drunkard whom they would,

144
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,220
you know, you were fighting both of them at once. I had to. All right, so they were making

145
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,190
fun of me. And then he started fighting two people at the same time. All right, who started

146
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,059
this fight? Did you start it? Or did somebody for a rocket? Who started the fight? I can tell

147
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:33,140
you who ended it. He didn't have a bruise or anything. Oh, he did. I think it was me. I

148
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,890
kicked the one on the left and then wanted to get the one on the right. But but they ended

149
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:47,750
it. They knocked me to the ground and paid me back for hitting them. Okay, so you so they

150
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:55,339
made they made fun of me and then you kicked one of them. Okay, what did you really break

151
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:01,660
Antoine's tooth? There's a really noisy courtroom with nobody being here. Yeah.

152
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,119
Frederick is just a child. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think I broke his tooth.

153
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,759
Did you hit him in the face? I think I kicked him, but not that hard. Okay, but in the

154
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:26,759
face. Did you kick him in the face? What were they saying? Are you too drunk to guess? Who

155
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:34,390
is this person? Can I contempt a court this person out of here? I was not asking you.

156
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,390
They were yelling that you are well, I told them that it's not true. And they started

157
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,339
calling me names. They called me a drunkard's son. Okay, so let me look at this one more

158
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:52,250
time. The young one now has a chipped front tooth. He probably fell down. Let me look

159
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,380
at this shit. Negative relations with factions mean negative consequences for you.

160
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:07,980
AKA the fervor in Paris rising. So this is my relations. There are factions. Yeah, reputation.

161
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,460
Reputation impacts everything in the world of the game. Factions, family relations,

162
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,779
the audience's attitude. That's you. That's you guys. The fervor in the sections and even the

163
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,099
ability to persuade other characters. You have a set amount of influence points per day. In

164
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:29,460
the future, you will be able to increase this limit. All right, so how many death penalties

165
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,359
do I have? Zero. So this is the common folk. This is how the common folk feel about me. This

166
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:40,150
is how the revolutionaries feel about me. This is my reputation is pretty much right in the

167
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:48,220
Okay, this good to know. What's this? Events. Here you'll find okay, this is information about

168
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,220
events. And then this last one is people and family and okay, you can see detailed

169
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:01,500
info. So this is my wife. This is my oldest son. No, it's not. Yes, this is my oldest

170
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:10,660
son. This is my youngest son. I have my dad and then my mentor. Got it. So this is all family in

171
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:22,789
here. All right, so look at the hierarchy for a second. This is me. A judge of the

172
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,670
Revolutionary Tribunal, generally considered drunkard and gambler, a protege of Raymond

173
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,910
DuVoy, who introduced him to the world of law and regulations. In private, he is an

174
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:37,220
unremarkable character. We'll just wait till I make it up to like top 1000 streamer

175
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,190
in Vegas. All right, so let's let me get this straight. He started the fight. Somebody if

176
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,549
somebody calls me names, you just tell them you just you just tell them to shut the fuck up.

177
00:21:52,549 --> 00:22:03,289
Okay. You can't like attack somebody you can't you're guilty. You say leave me alone.

178
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:17,670
You say oh yeah well my dad's a judge. What's this? Make your decision. Each action may

179
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,589
require a different number of influence points and have a different chance of success. Consider

180
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:33,299
them carefully. Intimidate parents. We can go right to evil if you want. Your addictions

181
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,539
are no longer a secret. The fact that other children are bullying your son because of them

182
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:42,900
is a minor problem. But who is spreading those rumors? It is likely to be one of their

183
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,859
parents. They could have whispered into their children's ears whom they shouldn't play with

184
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:53,859
and why. They might even have spiced the story with a lie. But who will but who will hear it next?

185
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,160
Now I can't just go fall on chaotic evil. No. Let's talk eye to eye. This is one influence

186
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:23,539
point. Talk eye to eye. Neighborhood gossip. So now what does that do for me now?

187
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:42,380
Neighborhood gossip. Yeah I've read this already. So this is reputation influence. I mean I

188
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:51,579
already read this. Did that show up in a different place? Maybe we'll see later on.

189
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,910
Because I don't think I can. I think that just means I'm going to talk to them. Any other

190
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:08,140
questions? Now what about you guys? Can I interact with anybody here? No I think that

191
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:15,130
just happens at some point later on. Because now there's nothing really else to do. Vertex

192
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:26,380
form. To the gallows. No. I mean I found the defendant guilty of the offense which they

193
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,099
were charged. You kicked somebody. How am I supposed to prove that you didn't, right?

194
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:39,670
Here's my signature. I'm not going to give my actual signature because I don't want anyone to

195
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:49,240
have that. What's my name? I'm scared to even do anything remotely similar. How about um

196
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:06,519
oh there we go. I did it. Guilty. Unfortunately you should not start fights regardless of

197
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:17,579
the reason. Look come on. Does my son go to prison? Those children are so small and they

198
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:23,339
already know the truth. The father of my children is a lying drunk and a gambler. Bernard used to

199
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:28,700
worship you but he soon grew up. Now it is Frederick's turn to learn the truth that echoes

200
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,329
in the streets. He's no longer fearing your anger. He knows that your threats are empty.

201
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,250
Frederick is only starting to learn the truth about his father from the streets.

202
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,619
I was unaware that Matilda had such a temper. As was I. We will wait outside as always.

203
00:25:54,599 --> 00:26:11,640
Congratulations. You passed the first judge exam. Paris. Liberty. We were enchanted by the idea

204
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:25,140
of freedom. Could not resist it. Is that me or am I taking these pictures? Yeah I'm taking

205
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,299
these photos. Whole families took to the streets. We're on like this is like vacation photos.

206
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:46,869
France was never so happy. We were enchanted by the idea of freedom.

207
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,859
Yeah this is the revolution. Yeah I know it's very loud. It's one of those games

208
00:26:52,859 --> 00:27:02,170
it's very loud if it's in a cut scene. Act one. All right here we go. Liberty day one.

209
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:21,460
Okay here we go. So expected sentence. Find out which verdict is expected by the factions

210
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:34,089
and your close ones. Okay so acquittal and prison. The common folk and revolutionaries want

211
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:46,839
prison and this is um nobody expected but who is it? Police file. Okay hold on. Wait wait wait

212
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,759
everybody hold on a second. I need like a minute to get ready. There's no timer.

213
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,839
I can take as long as I want. Imagine a judge saying this. I can take as long as I want. I

214
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:04,299
just I need to review the case first. I might need to get a coffee too. All right so this is

215
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,079
in difficult times people like to seek peace at the bottom of a glass.

216
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:18,809
Please introduce yourself. My name is Jean Renard and the Montserrat is huge. Nothing but a fraud.

217
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,970
Systematically opposing the opinion of the jury may lead to serious consequences.

218
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:30,119
Okay so everyone wants this guy arrested. Let's see what he did.

219
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,059
Compiled by Richard Moneur. Fraud. Jean Renard, a 45 year old innkeeper, has been charged with

220
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:44,299
fraud. He's accused of diluting alcohol in his tavern, tricking his clients into paying extra.

221
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:51,750
Okay. Guests came with their mindset on a specific goal, getting roaring drunk,

222
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,869
but instead of staggering out after drinking two pitchers of wine or several pints of beer,

223
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:00,549
they would sit in the inn until morning still sober and completely penniless.

224
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,670
The innkeeper's fraud came to light when one of the customers discovered the scam

225
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,390
and caught the cheater in the act. The man entered the host cellar and witnessed him

226
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,710
diluting the alcohol in the barrels with ordinary water. As a result, customers received

227
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,150
only four parts of what they had paid for and one part from the water carrier.

228
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:32,059
So he was diluting alcohol, but all right. So let's see. So diluting alcohol. So the innkeeper

229
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,920
exposing the innkeeper, customers drunkenness, adding water was the method.

230
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,460
Okay. Diluting alcohol was the method. But what about, I need a motive. What's going on here?

231
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:55,400
Motive for the innkeeper. Caught in a trap. What does that mean? I wouldn't even caught in

232
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:08,920
a trap. Did he set a trap? I can't ask any more questions. What? No. Customers drunkenness,

233
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,579
are the witnesses. Fuck. Shit. Exposing the innkeeper is the motive.

234
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:27,910
It's the motive and exposing the innkeeper. We need witnesses, right? Okay. We're good.

235
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:35,640
Here we go. So we have influence on the jury's opinion. This is people are going to want like

236
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:47,029
guillotine. Should I just call in the witness? People want this guy dead. How long you've

237
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:50,309
been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol? Yeah, that means like,

238
00:30:51,190 --> 00:31:00,859
do your clients drink a lot? Okay. Please call in Thomas Leclerc to the stands.

239
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:09,160
Please introduce yourself. Thomas Leclerc. I'm the regular Gene Renard's establishment.

240
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay. How long have you suspected that something was wrong with the alcohol?

241
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,450
How did you catch citizen? How did you catch him in the act? How'd you catch him in the

242
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:32,809
act? I was having one drink after another. So I had to, you know, I'm Monterey. I think

243
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:37,289
that means Pete. So it happened that one time I got lost and instead of, you know, I

244
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,369
ended up in the cellar where I saw Renard adding water to the barrels.

245
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,549
Fuck. They want him in prison. All right. So that's a witness testimony.

246
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,250
Wait, wait, wait. Can I tell her, can I like, is it like, where's my gavel?

247
00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:04,230
Please call it, okay. Review the trials records so I can review what happened previously.

248
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:10,970
All right. A button news here. Here we go. Neighborhood gossip. The father had a rare

249
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,049
episode of foolishness when he decided to stand up to someone stronger. Threatening

250
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,930
him with a fist and showing his children they are safe by his side. He did not listen to

251
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,650
your arguments. Furthermore, he gave a precise description of where you can shove them. What?

252
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:32,660
Why am I getting this right now during a case? Like somebody just slides that on the

253
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:41,559
desk. I know you're busy with this, this case, but somebody, what? I don't know,

254
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:48,819
man. I might, I might say fuck this guy. Okay. So threatening him with a fist and

255
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,700
showing his children they're safe by his side. He didn't listen to your arguments.

256
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:59,900
What we don't, oh yeah. Like I'm supposed to be doing a case here.

257
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,450
I'm hiring thugs not to hurt them. They're going to go do the, two of them are going

258
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,410
to go. I had two influence points. They're going to both raise their fist at him like

259
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,930
he did to me. And then he's going to hire three thugs and do that to me. And we're

260
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:20,259
going to keep going until one of us eventually wins the auction. All right. So let's take a look

261
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:24,740
again. We already know. All right. Let me do some more questions. Probably let's question them.

262
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:34,470
Okay. So how did you feel? Do clients drink a lot? Tavern regulars usually drink a lot.

263
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,920
So you have been selling plenty of wine. Quite a lot. Yeah. And yet you have been

264
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,240
paying taxes on the amount of wine you bought, not the amount of wine you've been selling.

265
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:55,049
Correct. I don't understand. You've been paying taxes on four wine barrels, but by adding a quarter

266
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:59,769
of water to each have actually made the money for selling five barrels of wine.

267
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:06,660
Oh, that's one way of putting it, but perhaps it is correct. I'm not good with numbers.

268
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,300
You are not good with numbers, yet good enough to have calculated that fraud pays off.

269
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,739
I wasn't aware. I will take this answer into account.

270
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:27,099
The judge has exposed the bastard. This guy's an idiot. Okay. How long you've been involved

271
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:33,320
in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol. It's not an illegal practice. Everyone adds a

272
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,849
little bit. In your case, it was a bit of wine in the water, not the other way around.

273
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:43,460
Have you been doing this for a long time? A few weeks at the most. It's been hard to

274
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,179
earn a living lately. I used to run an honest business. Pure wine was overspilling the

275
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,119
glasses. Is there any proof to support your testimony? He lied to his customers. No reason

276
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,300
he wouldn't lie in court. Does he have anything? Give me some documents. Anything.

277
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:12,389
You don't got anything to give me here. How did you feel about tricking the citizens?

278
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,780
Terrible. But all I wanted was to keep my business afloat. Others don't mess around for

279
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,380
sure. No diluting would be the end of me. So you decided to commit fraud so as not to lose

280
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,940
money. If I lost my tavern, my family would starve to death. Do you have children? I do.

281
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,599
One son and two daughters. Time to start saving up for the dowry. Then why don't you send them

282
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:44,679
to work? Idiot. All right. It's, uh, jury's opinion is prison. They're getting inflamed

283
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:56,329
here. People want him in prison. Uh, let me see. Yeah. Let's take a look. What do we

284
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:02,780
got here? Choose a verdict to see its influence. The jury votes in favor of incarceration.

285
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,710
The defendant, they find the punishment sufficient. Choose a verdict. Prison.

286
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,840
So this would, uh, give me a reputation bonus with common folk and with revolutionaries.

287
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,530
Reputation bonus if you can get up there. Okay. Uh, what about a quiddle?

288
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:32,809
Go on. Go free. Just don't do it again. All right. I'm sorry, sir, but you've been,

289
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:36,250
I mean, we've got witness testimony. We've got your own testimony. You're talking about tax

290
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:45,260
fraud. You're going to prison. Sorry, but that's the way it is. I sentence citizen

291
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:54,070
Jean Renard to prison. Lead the condemned out. Huzzah. Long live pure wine. All right.

292
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:59,500
Moving on. After trial, click to move on to the next part.

293
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,750
We're going to get some big like fucking M. Night Shyamalan twist.

294
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:18,099
Verdict form. Here we go. Okay. May I remind you that you promised to join me?

295
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:24,230
I have a feeling that tonight's moon favors gamblers, though it does not favor spouses.

296
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:29,849
God should grace us with wives who understand the importance of an evening game of dice.

297
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:34,010
They should also know that the right amount of wine guarantees a lucky role.

298
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:41,849
I should go home. Bringing a judge to the game has benefits. Other players will surely not cheat.

299
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:47,449
That is not a strong argument. My name is Jacques-Louis David.

300
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,130
I am but a humble painter, not a silver-tongued judge.

301
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,780
You are a sly politician, Jacques. As a politician, I understand the

302
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,739
importance of keeping promises. And you, my friend, are trying to get out of yours.

303
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,320
Go out or go home? I just got in trouble with my wife for going out.

304
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,619
Go out. But this could be a good political move for me.

305
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:36,280
Send thugs. Oh my god. But what about my career? Nah, I'm gonna do the right...

306
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:43,909
Not tonight, Jay. Now he's gonna work to undermine me.

307
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:55,539
Oh, how boring! I could be sitting in that seat right there with my coins.

308
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:02,949
The same cold meatloaf and cold peas and cold potatoes and cold gravy and

309
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:10,920
cold thyme leaves and cold plates and cold eyes staring back at me, angry with me.

310
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:27,769
Late evening at the judge's house. Uh-oh. What?

311
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:37,480
Do you not want to berate me like you always do? I'm glad you're home.

312
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,880
Are you aware that Frederick sometimes imagines you as a deep sea sailor?

313
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,369
He dreams that you visit distant countries and have wonderful adventures.

314
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:53,340
But he would rather have you by his side, on land. We all want that.

315
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:59,130
I don't want to watch the storm blow your lifeboat away and bury it beneath the waves.

316
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,309
There are no waves. The storm is getting closer.

317
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:07,239
Dark clouds already hang over the shore. Just wait until they finish building the guillotine.

318
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,400
Your oars will break at once and the waves will take you to a place you'll

319
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:27,050
soon wish you'd never set foot on. A place without us. Your family loves you.

320
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,170
But we won't find you in the darkness that has already begun to reach for you.

321
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,860
Relations with family. You have to choose an action. What?

322
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:47,719
Oh god. Upon returning home, you can decide how you would like to spend the rest of the day.

323
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:54,659
Each action will affect the other members of the family as well as their attitude towards you.

324
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:02,619
Okay. Each character's attitude can provide you with or deprive you of certain bonuses,

325
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:09,429
like reputation or relations with factions. Your youngest son is special.

326
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:14,469
His attitude makes the other family members, like you slightly more, take good care of him.

327
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:24,840
Okay, so hanging out with grandpa gives influence to the people.

328
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,309
Hanging out with Bernard is influence on the revolutionaries.

329
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:33,670
Hanging out with Matilda is influence on reputation and then influence on the family.

330
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:39,980
Opening night at the theater. There's a new play opening tonight on stage at the

331
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,849
Comme des Francaux. It is a good chance to take a breather from reality. Political debate.

332
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:50,119
It's time for the grown men to talk about the revolution's achievements.

333
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:56,809
It should be an interesting exchange. Spend your evening and your energy on carefree playtime

334
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:04,489
with your sons. Your wife's needs can wait. Reading together. There's nothing like sitting

335
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:10,150
with your family in a good book next to a warm fire, even though some may think it is dull.

336
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:20,789
Why don't we just all go out to the play? Everybody gets to go to the play.

337
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:34,489
Playtime with grandpa. Debate the child? No, the child is not. It's only these two.

338
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:40,219
No, all right. Let's involve everybody. Let's just hang out with the kids and just have fun.

339
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:48,380
We're gonna, okay. Why did you not? Oh, your wife's needs can wait. You weren't you not

340
00:42:48,380 --> 00:43:01,739
involved? So that influenced, oh man, my god. This is just, there's a lot going on here.

341
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,719
Okay, today the people of Paris commemorate Jacques Guillemin Simon, Mayor of Vintampes.

342
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,630
He was lynched by a furious mob for performing his duties to France.

343
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,389
This march shall symbolize the unity of our society in the hope that the most

344
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:24,710
violent stage of the revolution is past us. Let us make sure that no other loyal

345
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:36,139
servant of France becomes a victim of such hatred ever again from King Louis.

346
00:43:36,139 --> 00:43:40,780
Oh, Simon, you was a good loyal officer. Those bastards lynched him for observing the law.

347
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:49,880
Will you join me at the march? We have to show that we oppose the self-appointed

348
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,820
executioners and stand alongside. I wonder why the king has taken the trouble to show up.

349
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,639
Louis marching in arm and arm with the people of Paris, that is unexpected.

350
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:09,139
King Louis, continue please. I am merely an observer. Do not change your habits for me.

351
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,300
I heard a thing or two about a young and ambitious judge at the tribunal.

352
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,820
I was curious as to he guided by justice or by entertainment, as some would say.

353
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:35,190
Oh, we've got this theft and burglary. Hold on, we've got a dozen notifications here.

354
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,030
Good relationship with a younger son. Your younger son adores you like he used to back

355
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:48,650
in better days. This is a drawing, an invite. Oh, well thanks. That's nice of you.

356
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,059
Okay, so we've got a new case here. Got a good relationship with the son.

357
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,789
Is that, that's, that's, that's King Louis. I got some news here.

358
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:10,230
All right, neighborhood gossip. Uh-oh. Most parasi, I don't even know what that is,

359
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:15,909
ordinary. They have ordinary problems, ordinary consciences, and an ordinary's

360
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:20,389
resistance to pain. They were not hardened by the revolution. The father of the family

361
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:25,510
that spread the rumor about your weaknesses was no different. A few punches were more

362
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:34,730
than enough to convince his instincts that it was time to stop talking. Parisians.

363
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,760
Most, why does it just, why does the judge say most people from Paris?

364
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:52,059
Most Parisians. Is that what they're called? Parisians? I did not know that.

365
00:45:52,699 --> 00:46:00,969
All right, so common folk endorsement went down by two, but my reputation went up.

366
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:08,380
So that may not have been a great idea. Common folk minus two, reputation plus one.

367
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:14,139
That's from the gossip of the neighborhood. All right, let's go.

368
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:19,429
All right, here we go. Who do we have here? We have, the defendant is Oliver Muggler,

369
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:25,429
a 65 year old master locksmith who was famed among Parisian burglars as an expert on

370
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:32,440
unopenable locks. Okay. Last month, he was commissioned by the owners of a Parisian

371
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:40,599
glassworks, Jean Rude, Louis Rowe, and Ferdinand Salon to construct locks for ornate chests for

372
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,719
valuables, presumably as gifts for their wives. The craftsman praised his latest creation as

373
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:51,079
thief proof. Shortly following their completion, the industrialist houses were hit by a series

374
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:57,400
of burglaries committed by a recent newcomer to Paris, Hector Vian. The thief from Orleans

375
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:06,440
was caught in the act and shot by Ferdinand Salon. An expensive

376
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,480
Turgo map of Paris, but the houses of the recently robbed industrialist marked on it was

377
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,800
found on the deceased. Surprisingly, Salon had given Muggler an identical map as advanced

378
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,599
payment. This deposit was an addition to the agreed remuneration from all the employers.

379
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:30,969
Okay. So he had somebody do his dirty work. All right. Let's see. So we have master locksmith

380
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:36,900
who is a famous locksmith. So a month ago, these three people commissioned him to make

381
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:48,230
an impossible lock. Oh, there's more. Oh, right. Okay. So let me just, let me just get this,

382
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:53,269
make sure I get this straight. So construct locks for ornate chests. So he's like,

383
00:47:53,269 --> 00:47:56,389
yeah, I can make a lock for you and nobody will be able to break into it. Okay. Great.

384
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,539
After they were done, all their houses were hit by burglars

385
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:08,659
by a newcomer to Paris. Okay. This guy, Hector Vian, this is the thief from Orleans

386
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,139
and shot by Ferdinand Salon and anybody these people. Okay. So Ferdinand Salon

387
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:18,699
was one of the people that commissioned. So he was caught in the act at one of the houses.

388
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,829
I got it. Further interesting information came from the owner of the Ginger Margo Inn. She

389
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:29,590
recalled that on the night proceeding the burglary, the locksmith met there with a

390
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:35,429
man she didn't recognize. Based on her description, we were able to identify him as the affirmation

391
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:40,949
to Hector Vian. The men allegedly engaged in an evening of drinking sponsored by Muggler.

392
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:45,030
And then we have a map of Paris found on Hector Vian. Let's take a look.

393
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:55,929
Do I have that in my, uh, that's protocol. Where's, um, notebook somewhere. Kind of want

394
00:48:55,929 --> 00:49:02,809
to see the, uh, kind of want to see it. All right. So even though this is very obvious

395
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:13,269
evening of drinking, a drunken evening. Uh, that's not an accusation marks on the map

396
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:19,190
series of burglaries. Uh, been to master locksmith. We got, we only got fucking a few

397
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:26,780
questions asked here. Sentence and thugs. No, the famous thief. Try like accused that,

398
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:38,389
you know who that is. This is that's evidence. Master locksmith is what about the drunken

399
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:51,429
evening, the construction of the locks series of bullets. That's that's, but that's like

400
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:57,750
a course, it's course of events. Okay. I still have six more questions to reveal and I can only

401
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:06,230
make three mistakes. Marks on the map or I mean, come on, like you got marks on the goddamn

402
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:18,340
map. That's an accusation, right? Like yeah, drunken evening, course of events. Yeah. Lock

403
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:31,750
construction, uh, personality, famous thief. I guess you could say that's extending winning

404
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:44,380
circumstances. Maybe law construction is course of events. It's probably course of events.

405
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,980
Yeah. And then finally the master locksmith is extended. Okay. We got them all. No mistakes.

406
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:56,250
Uh, the jury has not revealed it's for it gets okay. The acquittal is for common folk.

407
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:01,690
Think this guy's a common folk. Think this is a good guy and the revolutionaries, uh,

408
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,940
think don't want to think he's a bad guy. We got the king in the court here and I am ready

409
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:13,460
to start my questioning. Robbing the persuasion is no crime. According to the case file,

410
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:22,420
you are citizen Oliver Muggler. Is that correct? Uh, uh, voice and see. Indeed it is.

411
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,579
More sure as you may have a request. I'd like to sit down. I'm an old man. You see

412
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:32,489
basic respect for the judiciary requires that you remain standing. The names salon,

413
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:38,840
rude and row mean anything to you. Why are you so determined to harass an old man?

414
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:46,119
They sound like the names of my debtors. Debtors. They are the victims of activities.

415
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:57,110
You conducted. You mean look smithing. You were commissioned by the victims to make

416
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,550
chess locks. Did you know Hector Vian before? Do you recognize this map?

417
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:05,750
Were you the one who marked the addresses on the map? How much did you charge for

418
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:13,239
your services? We'll start. We're gonna start at a zero. How much did you charge for your services?

419
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:22,219
3000 francs. Tidy some that is. If you were a master locksmith, you charge that much too.

420
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:28,739
That is quite a substantial fee. Indeed. That's how much it costs to have high

421
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:33,300
quality locks made by a master with nearly 50 years of experience. And those bastards never

422
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:40,170
paid me a single franc. The victims did not pay you the agreed amount. Not a franc. I'd

423
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:45,050
beat that money right out of them, but I'm too old for that. So you didn't get paid?

424
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:57,110
Cases break it open wide. All right. Um, that rumor has it that you're one of the best locksmiths

425
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:05,429
in all of Paris. I should deny it for modesty's sake, but I will not. That cannot be true,

426
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:10,710
though, as a random thief from Orleans was easily able to open your locks. Well, then

427
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:15,829
he must have been one of the best thieves in Orleans. I should be serious. Every lock can

428
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:23,849
be picked with the right talents, even mine. Okay. So we're going down towards

429
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:33,820
revolutionaries here. All right. It's time. I think it's time we, uh, we bring out the big

430
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:43,579
guns here. Hmm. You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks. Did you know

431
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:50,139
Hector Vian before? This is the first time I've heard the name. That's interesting as

432
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:53,260
you were seen draining several bottles of wine together at the Ginger Margo Inn.

433
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,500
Is that a crime? No, but the question is, why are you denying it now?

434
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,699
Was your drinking spree just a deception for discussing the burglary?

435
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,000
Nobody I had a drink with introduced themselves as Hector. I didn't plan on heist for Vector,

436
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:15,320
Victor or Hugo. I'm a locksmith and I earn good money from it. Burglaries are for vagrants

437
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,090
without a job. Okay. So you may have been drinking with them. There's no way to tell

438
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:32,039
that you knew them beforehand. Okay. You recognize this map? No, I don't recall ever

439
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:37,340
seeing it before. Ferdinand Salon claims that he gave you this map as advanced payment

440
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:44,300
for your services. He claims what? That wicked wretch of a second rate merchant. He gave me

441
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,260
a scrap of old paper as payment for making three locks and said it's supposed to be worth

442
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,730
more than 3000 francs he owes me. And honest labor is being judged while frauds remain

443
00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:02,969
at large. Silence. So this map does belong to you. It doesn't. So where's the map that you

444
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:11,989
received from Citizen Salon? I lost it. Oh, what horse shit. I lost it. But it wasn't even worth

445
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:16,869
a loaf of bread. So I surely won't shed a tear. But if you have it, maybe you stole it from

446
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:24,550
me. You better make a note of that Oliver Muggler demands rumination from Rude, Roy and Salon.

447
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:40,619
All right. Hold on a second here. I didn't pay him though. Can I call somebody to the stands?

448
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:55,000
Can I? Did they not pay him? So circumstantially he could have been just drinking.

449
00:55:55,639 --> 00:56:06,090
That might he just may have been out there hanging out. And maybe he he got the map stolen

450
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:20,980
from him by the guy he was drinking with. Right. And if he didn't get paid, then maybe

451
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:46,150
he's just kind of disgruntled. Common people don't like that. Prison is not something that

452
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:53,380
the common people want. I have more questions. Do I? Is there a penalty to? Well, I mean,

453
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,820
I guess look, right? So depending on how I want to have this play out here,

454
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:03,139
I could ask another question. This one. This is balanced, right? Let's bring this up a little

455
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:10,980
bit. Or the neutral ones. Did you give Hector the map? I gave nothing to Achilles, Hector or

456
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:19,989
any other Greek God. Call on the witness citizen Jean Rude. Oh, there we go. Jean Rude in the

457
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:27,079
flesh. He will not speak unless called upon. Naturally, of course. What went missing during the

458
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:34,809
burglary? My house was the first one to be robbed. And in my case, it was mostly valuables.

459
00:57:34,809 --> 00:57:38,809
At Rue's house, he will not say it himself. And I do not want to go to prison.

460
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:45,460
It was the letters he had exchanged over the years with King Louis. Oh, damn monarchist.

461
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:52,460
Salon did not lose a thing. He shot that vermin in the act. That is what he said. What happened to

462
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:57,800
the items that he stole? That still remains unknown. According to Salon, Hector had nothing

463
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:05,239
with him. Ferdinand suspects he had hidden the other valuables somewhere. He hid the other

464
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:17,059
items before robbing the last house? Strange. Huh. Advanced payment in the form of a map,

465
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:20,739
its disappearance, the murder of a burglar, and a lack of payment for services.

466
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:26,809
You look upset. What are you afraid of? Yeah, look at all this shit.

467
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:36,380
And a lack of payment for services. It all makes for a rather strange story, a suspicious one,

468
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,469
too. I do not. What are you mumbling? If I say something, will I be free?

469
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:47,619
He knows something. Please testify what you know immediately.

470
00:58:50,679 --> 00:58:55,159
The map was Salon's idea. He told the thief about the advanced payment we gave

471
00:58:55,159 --> 00:59:02,679
the locksmith and proposed that Hector steal it. And he did? Indeed. But when the bastard robbed

472
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:07,719
us, later we were forced by Salon not to pay the locksmith because he sent the thief after

473
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:13,130
us. And that's when it all went down a drain. That's the bourgeoisie for you. He fooled them

474
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:19,340
all and went in one fell swoop. It sounds like citizen Salon had everything planned.

475
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,539
However, there's no evidence to support the claim. Perhaps it is citizen Rude that is

476
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:32,550
plotting against his partner and wants to frame him. And Vion is dead, so he will not be able to

477
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:40,969
shed light on any of this. If I was younger, I'd give that Salon a drubbin. I'd peep that

478
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:46,119
good-for-nothing lying bastard. Please restrain yourself. The testimony of a witness is still

479
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:55,699
not evidence. Neither of citizen Salon's guilt nor of your innocence. Oh shit. Well,

480
00:59:59,269 --> 01:00:03,429
I don't I don't think that you are I don't think you committed a crime here.

481
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:13,980
This is the jury's opinion. Yeah. Yeah, I think we got enough information here.

482
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:27,260
That's an acquittal. Ask the neutral questions? I don't think I even need to. Did you tell

483
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,659
Hector how to open the locks? I understand what you're implying, but consider this. If

484
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:36,300
he sold the secret of my locks, then my business would be over. Wood spreads fast among

485
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:44,440
thieves. Yeah, I guess I could probably ask one of these. I don't think it would go up much higher.

486
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:49,670
I need to know. Were you the one who marked the addresses on the maps? No,

487
01:00:50,550 --> 01:01:01,539
no, he didn't do shit. He's he's innocent. Yep, we're gonna be I got some we lost with

488
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:06,170
the revolutionaries though. Risk of being removed from office. We can't let this go down that

489
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:19,349
far. Kill him just in case. This is risky, because that makes it I gotta think about my career.

490
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:26,500
All right, acquittal. That's my verdict. There's way there's way too much going on here.

491
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:37,909
The verdict for citizen Oliver Muggler is not guilty. Lead the defendant away.

492
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:46,090
Bravo, Muggler. Away with the bourgeoisie. If I may, to be honest, this does bear the marks of

493
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:55,050
social justice. They would not pay him so he had them robbed. There is a balance here. Grandpa,

494
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:07,239
that's not really what happened. Common folk. Okay, lost with the revolutionaries, but gained

495
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:13,539
with common folk. Senile old man couldn't even hear the case. Is that am I good to go?

496
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:20,469
Well, that's because I lost some common folk. So I just gained it back. What am I doing on

497
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:28,230
the hierarchy? I'm still just oh, wait a minute, hold on. Who are these two? David. Oh, that's the

498
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:36,170
guy that came to me and said, who is this guy with the sunglasses on? He's widely referred to

499
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:41,929
as the incorruptible. As leader of the radical Jacobins. He preserves order in the national

500
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:46,889
convention with an iron fist and of need be terror. Undeniably the most powerful man in

501
01:02:46,889 --> 01:03:01,159
Paris in the age of revolution. As yet none have dared defy him. That's me. So this is my friend

502
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,789
and I don't know who that is. I guess I don't know who that is yet. All right,

503
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:08,469
we've got plenty of good names here. All right, congratulations, you're free.

504
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:20,199
I think that's good. Let's get out of here. Next. Look, an authentic map by Togo. It would

505
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:27,989
be a pity if it rotted in a safe deposit box. We cannot do that. These are court deposits.

506
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:31,900
Well, the tilde did tell me long ago to take care of my study at home.

507
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,900
There you go. I know someone who can remove these marks without damaging the map.

508
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:47,110
The king is just still hanging out here. Is he sleeping? King Louis the 16th. There were people

509
01:03:47,110 --> 01:04:06,570
who truly loved him. He reminded the French they had noble ancestors. Do not be manipulated

510
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:13,340
by people who are not bearing the burden of responsibility. Good George Washington right there.

511
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:21,989
Well, this saddened me. Someone had advised him to say that. Someone who was well aware

512
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:33,110
of the cold, inevitable wind of change. I did not pity the king, but those who will come after

513
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:46,309
him as they will not have great ancestors. Okay, one of us. A Frenchman marched in the

514
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:51,030
streets of Paris side by side, one line after another to commemorate Jacques Guillemin

515
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:56,949
a mayor of Entemps. He was murdered by a furious mob, punished for a law he did not enact,

516
01:04:56,949 --> 01:05:01,989
but was obliged to observe. Freedom of speech killed him. If we understand this as the right

517
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:06,710
to cast stones to show one's discontent, the right to murder people because you deem them

518
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:11,829
responsible for your miserable life, surely the people of Paris would prefer if we said that

519
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:29,059
nothing happened. Lost common folk. Gain revolutionary. Your son is rather good with

520
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:36,619
the violin. He is both talented and enthusiastic. I'd prefer that he was as enthusiastic about the

521
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:42,150
law books I give him. I look so defeated. Maybe his destiny is to become an artist,

522
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:47,690
not a lawyer. Mother likes to hear me playing, and there is nothing more boring than law.

523
01:05:48,969 --> 01:05:55,269
See? He would rather let his career rely on the humours of the people. There are many ways

524
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:59,829
to re-zoo-escue France. Believe me, our country desperately needs something to ennoble

525
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:05,670
it. The power is in the hands of simple, illiterate people. Let him rescue their souls with music.

526
01:06:08,139 --> 01:06:14,519
That's better than boring laws and clauses. See what you're doing? You are spoiling my child.

527
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:21,800
I do not have my own children to spoil, so I am focusing on yours. Speaking of which...

528
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:31,820
Oh, no, no, no, no. Here we go. Locked action. After various important events,

529
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:36,539
you may find yourself in an action forced upon you. On this day, you become the victim of

530
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:45,719
your own decisions. Oh, c'est manuel. You cannot change. You attended the parade in memory of

531
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:59,030
the lynched official. So that's what we did. That's what we're going to do. People influence

532
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:05,670
Bernard, influence on revolutionaries. Wife is not that happy. Son's doing all right.

533
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:20,280
Liberté. Day three. That is our new symbol of freedom. You can still smell the fresh wood.

534
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,340
Do you feel free looking at it? Individuals like us do not need symbols, but France does.

535
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:34,309
Did you hear the news of the day? People are running around like headless chickens

536
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:37,110
and yelling about Louis and his entourage escaping Paris.

537
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:40,869
So we will not be enjoying the aroma of fresh wood for long.

538
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:46,230
Monuments like that are not installed solely for the purpose of punishing thieves or lesser

539
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:54,380
aristocrats. Do you think it wants to taste royal blood? Louis' flight was a stupid move,

540
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:00,460
yet it seems it was planned. One of us will sacrifice him. That is, if they catch him.

541
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:11,449
Is that why Louis visited us at the court? To manipulate us? Maybe deep in his heart he

542
01:08:11,449 --> 01:08:16,489
felt what the builders of the guillotine did. That someone has to be exposed as a traitor,

543
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:32,310
even if there is none. Interesting. Okay. This is Antoine. Welcome, citizen Fidel. My name is

544
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:38,949
Antoine Quentin Faquer de Tinville. I am the public prosecutor that has been assigned to assist

545
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:47,060
at every tribunal trial starting from today. Okay. I should warn you that I am uncompromising,

546
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,699
although I hope that we quickly find common ground. In happier news, the construction of

547
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:56,600
the guillotine has been finished. We may begin using it today. Yes, we've seen it.

548
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,560
The king is gone. Treason. Anyone with information about his whereabouts should

549
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:13,880
immediately disclose it to the authorities. From Rasputin. Okay. Anyone with information

550
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:20,060
about his whereabouts should immediately disclose it to the authorities. Okay.

551
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:29,939
So I'm assuming this is a little law here. What does this start? Okay, so this is

552
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:41,750
burglary. Notifications. Let's see. Uh, good relations with the father. Yours,

553
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:53,539
pride and joy. Keep it up. Anything else? Okay. So father and son, both very, very happy.

554
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:02,699
So we've got death penalty, prison, and then acquittal. That's the common vogue and

555
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:10,489
revolutionaries. The jury has not revealed its verdict yet. We need to use the new toy. Oh,

556
01:10:10,489 --> 01:10:21,539
God. Do it. Do it with no questions.

557
01:10:26,659 --> 01:10:38,069
Immediately do it. You got, hold on a second. They just, they're not even done building it.

558
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:51,319
I want blood. Do it. Do it. At least once. No. What? There is no save game.

559
01:10:55,189 --> 01:11:08,920
Do it. They just built it. Oh my God, guys. That's gonna,

560
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,520
the defendant confessed to the crimes.

561
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:39,750
No. What made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people? Uh, uh, this one. How did the

562
01:11:39,750 --> 01:12:03,000
defendant explain signs of assault? Um, I don't know. I don't know. I sentence citizen

563
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,460
John Ilver to be guillotined. I just got an achievement for doing that by the way. The

564
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:15,020
evidence against him was not conclusive. Outrageous. What are you doing? You fool,

565
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,659
traitor of the people, murderer of our hero. A verdict already? What about the trial?

566
01:12:22,899 --> 01:12:29,270
Bad job. I got an achievement for that. It said, I think if you guillotine somebody within

567
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:43,319
10 seconds of it starting, you get an achievement. Rumors are spreading. Rumors

568
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:46,680
about your careless approach to your duties are spreading. You'd better shape it up if you

569
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:56,859
want to keep your job. That wasn't worth it. Maybe it was for the achievement.

570
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:17,289
Well, no, maybe I could win the heart of the crowd. Earn the favor of the crowd by delivering

571
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:27,079
a speech or proceed directly to the execution. I have to give a speech on me? Just remember,

572
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:31,000
once you start your speech, there's no going back. An awkward or clumsy speech will earn

573
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,399
you nothing but ridicule from the audience. Depending on your reputation, the crowd will

574
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:52,550
be more or less aggressive. Strategy building? What? Before attempting persuasion, you may

575
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:57,590
explore different approaches to all the topics of the conversation. After employing every

576
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,409
kind of emotion, you will receive an evaluation of your choices. Okay.

577
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:08,279
Each attitude comes with a set of emotions that have a positive and negative impact.

578
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:11,479
Learn their effects to manipulate the people of Paris in any way you please.

579
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:15,640
The higher your reputation, the more you know about the other speaker's attitude.

580
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:19,000
You can also obtain this information by spending influence points.

581
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:31,380
Okay. Choose topic. Humility. The defendant. Manipulation. Revolution. Okay. Oh my God.

582
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:52,010
Crime. Aggression. Defendant. Humility. Revolution. Manipulation. I got points,

583
01:14:52,010 --> 01:15:01,979
right? Oversensitive. Okay. So they go. A strong argument. Good. And they're attached.

584
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:07,819
So maybe actually, yeah. Manipulate humility and we'll go with some aggression here.

585
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,239
If they're oversensitive, why would I want to be aggressive? If they're attached,

586
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:25,859
why would I want to be aggressive? No. What are you talking about? I don't think I need

587
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:44,300
it. Here we go. Today marks the what? What's going on? When there is a crime,

588
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:50,539
there must be punishment and we shall dish it out. Oh, yes. Even the convict's ancestor

589
01:15:50,539 --> 01:16:00,760
Scheffler, the cold edge of the guillotine slicing through their necks. The criminals

590
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:09,479
belong in the grave. Only then we build a better future. The reign of the previous

591
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:14,359
rulers whose goal was to bring injustice to the people ends with their swift deaths.

592
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:24,970
They were doubtful. All right. I understand. You can reveal it.

593
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:31,640
You decapitated a man for a scuffle in the streets. People, I rescued you and now you

594
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:51,739
murder me. What? Off with his head. Pull the revolution. Oh, I have to do this.

595
01:16:52,619 --> 01:17:20,250
I'm just the judge. Pull the ro- Due to the establishment of a revolutionary tribunal,

596
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:24,489
we need to prepare an official stamp. I was told to ask you, citizen,

597
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:35,479
because President DeVoy is indisposed. How much did he drink? He was not able to say,

598
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:51,100
shall we? Design your stamp. Okay. My base. I want it to be three dots. I like this. I like

599
01:17:51,100 --> 01:18:00,039
that. Emblem, the crow, the chicken, the compass, the horn, the scale, the book,

600
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:13,289
the White House, the owl, the quarter, the judge, the tree, the surrender, the time,

601
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:26,489
the key, the lady, the goblet of fire, the lion, defense, eagle, bow and arrow,

602
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:44,550
musket man, and then two crayons. I think I'm going to do two crayons. I like, no,

603
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:53,939
something a little small. I like that. Change the base. If we're going to have two,

604
01:18:53,939 --> 01:19:00,970
if we're going to have the crayon crossed, then it needs to, that's all right. That looks

605
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:12,569
good. Thank you for your time. I know it's late. The stamp should be ready tomorrow.

606
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:24,539
Good night. Look, okay. Work on tomorrow's trial. All right. Now that I got that, like,

607
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:31,029
you can't ask for that again. You used your one chat joke Trump card, right? Not again.

608
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:39,029
So work on tomorrow's trial. You will unlock more question effects in court. I have to do

609
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:56,229
this because I need to make sure this trial is done correctly. The wife. Go gamble. Evening

610
01:19:56,229 --> 01:20:01,109
gambling. You should spend some time with your father every now and then. Show him your world.

611
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:08,600
Perhaps you will get a taste for it. Your world. Go lie down face up with the neck in guillotine

612
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:26,300
and pray for soft winds. Paragraphs and codes. Needs to learn some more

613
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:33,500
perspective skills and law can be taught. And law can be an art in its own right.

614
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,020
Your eldest wife is going to hate you? I only have one wife. What are you talking about?

615
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,300
You take your family for an evening stroll around Paris. It will let your father stretch

616
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:57,939
his bones a little. Let's take the family up. Wow, he hated that. He liked it. Okay. What about

617
01:20:57,939 --> 01:21:09,939
the son? Nice. Almost got a fall bar. He's old. He hates walking. You only read chat when

618
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:14,659
they give you shitty joke advice. Why? I read chat the whole day. What? What are you talking

619
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:24,819
about? That was okay. That was a unanimous chat decision. All right. There was only a couple

620
01:21:24,819 --> 01:21:30,899
of one guys that didn't want me to do that. You cannot go back to your chat logs and you

621
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:37,590
look at that unanimous chat display. It was, I didn't even need to do a poll. It was so

622
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:45,859
overwhelming. I got the achievement. I got like the kill a guy without even looking.

623
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:59,850
Achievement. All right. Anyway, let's go. I wasn't joking and I'm glad you killed him.

624
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:10,789
All right. All right. Here's Matthew. Tragically, we are losing control of the streets.

625
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:16,470
People feel betrayed by the king and some believe him to be a spy trying to elude justice.

626
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:23,670
Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest. We only need an opinion from the judges

627
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:27,590
to make sure. I'm going to read that again because I have to do that again. I wasn't paying

628
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:32,390
attention. Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest. We only need an opinion

629
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:37,319
from the judges to make sure we are working legally. In other words, you need their

630
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:42,390
blessing to shoot at protesters. People can't control their emotions and are hurting at the

631
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:47,109
citizens as a result. Look at the windows. Next time they might do something worse than

632
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:55,689
just throw rocks. It pains us to see unrest growing in the streets of Paris.

633
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:00,569
Commander in Chief Burel has informed us that the guard is no longer able to control the

634
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:05,050
situation through peaceful means. It is recommended that he be allowed to use more

635
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:09,210
immediate methods to protect the innocent civilians. But we would like to know the

636
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:14,939
tribunal's opinion on the matter. I approve of the National Guard's use of force against

637
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:33,529
running, ruining the capital. Accept it. Chat deserves karma.

638
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:54,090
No, no, I'm with Grandpa on this one. Yeah, no. The authority should not use force against

639
01:23:54,090 --> 01:24:11,800
the people. If it has to, it already has lost. I do not approve of this decree.

640
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:17,079
Oh, right. I just put it on my signature. It's the first time I've done this. I don't know.

641
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,399
Without this document, we can only wait for the citizens of Paris to start killing each

642
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:29,319
other before our very eyes. I hope you know what you're doing. The convention may have issued

643
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:41,420
that decree, but I have no doubt it was Robert Svearie's idea. Executes a guy with literally

644
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:49,590
no trial. Whoa, violence against civilians. Ah, that's not okay. That wasn't me. I was

645
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:58,649
out sick that day. Chat took over that day. I was out sick. The mob wanted to act as both

646
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:03,529
judge and jury again and hang people from the street lamps. Poor Pochard was almost hanged.

647
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:11,109
Pochard? Claude Pochard? Exactly. The beloved tutor of your Frederick. You had to dismiss him

648
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:16,699
after the incident with the oath of the clergy, did you not? Yes, Frederick tells me from time

649
01:25:16,699 --> 01:25:23,100
to time that he misses his teacher. What are you doing? The trial is about to begin.

650
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:30,100
It's about Monsieur Pochard. News travels fast. He's been accused of counter-revolutionary

651
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:37,609
activities. You know him. It can't be true. It's not so simple. Leave before somebody hears

652
01:25:37,609 --> 01:25:50,550
us. Papa, please go home. Think about the family for once at least. Papa. Uh oh.

653
01:25:54,569 --> 01:25:58,170
Good relationship with the elder son. Got good relationship. Okay. All right. Let's see here.

654
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:07,180
We got the family wants acquittal. This is the revolutionaries want prison and the common folk

655
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:19,020
want the death penalty. Okay. Interesting. You are, please introduce yourself. This is Claude

656
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:24,520
Pochard. Monsieur les jours, you know me. State your personal information or there will be

657
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:30,739
consequences. Claude Pochard. Monsieur les jours. You stand accused of spying for the

658
01:26:30,739 --> 01:26:35,060
counter-revolutionaries and criticizing the existing order. Do you admit to these crimes?

659
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:41,369
I am innocent. The accusation is exaggerated and comes from the ill will of the accusers.

660
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:48,250
Suggesting that the revolutionary government is acting in ill will. Typical of a priest.

661
01:26:52,680 --> 01:27:00,199
All right. Let's see. Okay. Counter-revolution and treason.

662
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:11,859
Claude Pochard, a 26-year-old vicar and tutor, son of a cobbler, believes in enlightenment ideals.

663
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:19,859
After refusing to endure the civil constitution of the clergy, he was removed from his parish,

664
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:24,819
prohibited from carrying out his duties, and sentenced to banishment. Despite this,

665
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:31,619
he stayed in Paris and continued his work as a tutor, which he started before 1789.

666
01:27:32,659 --> 01:27:38,180
Pochard was captured in the streets by fortuitous circumstance. A guard officer

667
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:43,779
present during his trial a few months ago recognized him and didn't hesitate to act.

668
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:48,899
Following an investigation, Pochard was accused of spying and spreading

669
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:54,659
counter-revolutionary propaganda in order to prepare for an intervention that would end

670
01:27:54,659 --> 01:28:02,020
the revolution. Correspondence with Archbishop Jean Arsène des Bretus was found in a room

671
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:08,020
Pochard had been renting from Marie Gimmett. In it, the clergyman asked for information about

672
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:15,460
the unrest and the supporters of the monarchy in hiding. Riches were also found, a golden

673
01:28:15,539 --> 01:28:28,020
chalice and a reliquary. Moreover, the director of one of the orphanages Claude

674
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:32,739
Toddin testified that the tutor would question the law of the revolution in front of the students,

675
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:39,939
stating that it was less important than the laws handed down by God. A letter to Claude

676
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:40,420
Pochard.

677
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:30,550
prepare for a foreign intervention that would end the revolution.

678
01:29:31,779 --> 01:29:39,270
They would riches also found. Let's take a look. So ban it, let's see, see, see. Okay.

679
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:49,699
A letter from the church riches spreading propaganda espionage. Tudor. Tudor. It's

680
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:57,100
banishment. So you were banished for speaking against, right? So this is this would be

681
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:13,500
counterrevolution. Fog. It's Tudor. Tutor. Tutor. Church riches. That's evidence.

682
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:26,149
Spreading propaganda. That's counterrevolution. Espionage. That's an accusation. Four more

683
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:36,409
questions possible. Parish priest. It's a personality question. Another possibility

684
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:48,260
for propaganda. I mean, that's an accusation. Letter from the archbishop. That looks like

685
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:55,399
evidence to me. Banishment is a course of events. We got them all. All right. We don't

686
01:30:55,399 --> 01:31:08,310
know where the jury stands at the moment. So we can just let's just do what do you teach? Why

687
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:13,989
did the accused stay in France despite being banished? Sekiro unlocks in three hours.

688
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:23,640
Wow. No, but I can't. I can't. Don't even tell me that. Don't tell me that. I already

689
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:31,319
got it loaded. Don't tell me that. All right. So why? That's a good question. Why are you still

690
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:37,819
here? What are you? Why are you still here? I had to take care of my sick mother. Without me,

691
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:44,729
she would surely have died. Why did you not take her with you? Good. Make the filth squirm.

692
01:31:45,289 --> 01:31:50,250
I was in no position to afford that. I'm just a poor parish priest who is unable to

693
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:56,229
even carry out his duties. I have to teach every single day to survive. Is that why you

694
01:31:56,229 --> 01:32:02,890
started spying for money? No. What information could I glean that would be useful to

695
01:32:04,489 --> 01:32:12,020
emigres? That of the supposed persecution of priests. The main argument that Archbishop

696
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:18,260
de Pertoux and Pius VI are using to convince Catholic monarchs to strike against the

697
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:25,739
revolution. I do not correspond with emigres and I certainly do not write about the

698
01:32:25,819 --> 01:32:30,500
suffering of our clergymen. I would like to remind you that we have evidence.

699
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:48,760
Away with the liar. Okay. We already got that one. Mother was sick. What do you teach?

700
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:54,250
The caregivers in orphanages only pay for reading and writing lessons.

701
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:00,279
So why did the accused teach children that God's laws stands above that of the republic?

702
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,560
You spread superstition and counter-revolutionary propaganda.

703
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:08,939
This is a misunderstanding. The children I teach are unable to understand such complicated

704
01:33:08,939 --> 01:33:15,529
matters. The accused's explanation further incriminates him. If they are unable to

705
01:33:15,529 --> 01:33:20,220
understand the topic, why would he even discuss it at all? The church spreads

706
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:25,220
ignorance and takes our money. I was only answering questions from the director of

707
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:30,819
the orphanages in Gambines. I said that God's laws stood above my banishment.

708
01:33:30,819 --> 01:33:34,819
It is God's law that prohibits me from leaving the country. I have a duty to help

709
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:47,899
those in need. Okay. We're currently leaning towards acquittal at the moment. I need more

710
01:33:47,899 --> 01:34:03,220
info. All right. So hold on. Who? Okay. This is my family would think this is a good idea

711
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:08,920
because this is a friend of the family. Common folk want the death penalty currently

712
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:18,119
leaning. All right. Here we go. What information did the accused manage to convey to Archbishop

713
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:18,840
de Bluthy?

714
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:57,079
to the letter? What a coincidence. Archbishop de Bluthy currently resides

715
01:34:58,180 --> 01:35:04,039
in Switzerland. It is indeed a coincidence. Many clergymen reside in Switzerland.

716
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:24,760
You believe that? I mean, that's come on. The accused travels extensively around the world,

717
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:31,590
around the Paris department. To what end? Why? I teach wherever I can find students. Doing

718
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:36,229
that requires time and effort, I admit. Is that why you received gold from your fellow

719
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:43,189
conspirators abroad? He travels around France to spy on people. The only money I see comes

720
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:48,390
from my students' caregivers. It's not at all immodest. So where did the riches found in

721
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:56,579
your room come from? They were litigar- they were lit- they were literally accountants.

722
01:35:57,140 --> 01:36:02,340
Oh, yeah. They were liturgic- they were liturgical accrotrements. I- everyone's gonna

723
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:07,689
make fun of me now. They were liturgical accrotrements. I saved them from the

724
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:11,289
plunder of the church and compents. I would rather go hungry than sell them.

725
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:27,159
They were literally- okay. Fanatic, thief, peddler of superstition. Boy, I know what

726
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:34,069
donation words I'm using next time. What- what does that mean? All right. Hold on.

727
01:36:38,619 --> 01:36:51,619
All right, some of the witness. Marie Gimé. Citizen, what is your name? Marie Gimé.

728
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:59,220
Monsieur Lejeu. Was the witness aware that she was renting a room to an unsworn Catholic priest?

729
01:36:59,859 --> 01:37:12,819
Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence? What if this is a- what if this is also a spy?

730
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:20,140
I'm gonna say this one. Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence? Meaning?

731
01:37:21,189 --> 01:37:27,619
Did he receive many letters? I don't remember any letters with his name. Perhaps he had a

732
01:37:27,619 --> 01:37:32,789
rich social life. Did he entertain many guests? I don't remember anyone visiting him at all.

733
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:36,550
He wasn't there most of the time anyway. He just used the room to sleep.

734
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:41,500
Where would he go? I don't ask my guests about things like that.

735
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:52,220
Did he pay rent on time? Did he ever criticize the revolution and its accomplishments?

736
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,229
Wow, did he pay his rent on time? I feel like this is much more-

737
01:38:01,029 --> 01:38:14,310
this makes more sense. Did he pay rent on time? Did he pay rent on time? Sometimes I had to

738
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:19,800
threaten to kick him out, but eventually he would always pay. So the accused did not strike

739
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:24,199
you as a person who has a substantial amount of money to operate with or spend freely?

740
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:30,489
No, he lived like a poor man. I mean, a normal fellow would never get rich from teaching.

741
01:38:32,409 --> 01:38:44,140
Okay. What stipend does the accused receive? So he is- maybe he's hiding it though.

742
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:51,699
What do you get from being a teacher?

743
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:08,659
I'm realizing this now. Yeah, this is not England. Let me rephrase this.

744
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:17,109
I don't know how to do a French accent.

745
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:23,430
I can't do that. I'm going back to English.

746
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,079
Why did the accused continue teaching instead of leaving?

747
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:05,899
All right. I think people are going to start chanting for his head here. I got to-

748
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:06,859
Hold on. Where's the evidence?

749
01:40:20,949 --> 01:40:25,140
Oh, I can do this. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

750
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:51,899
It's not sacrament, merely prayer.

751
01:40:57,739 --> 01:40:58,300
Stupid!

752
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:16,199
Oh. Why did the accused continue teaching? Why did you do this?

753
01:41:25,449 --> 01:41:27,609
Your knowledge is a Catholic propaganda!

754
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:31,930
I prefer the term- all right, hold on. They are both of the same-

755
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:39,100
I'm trailing into like Jamaican. You're right. All right. Hold on.

756
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:43,979
I prefer the term. I prefer the term Catholic values.

757
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:56,329
Okay. Jury's opinion is- doesn't- don't need to kill him.

758
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,539
Family wants to be acquitted. Hold on. Let me see anything else I can do here.

759
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,359
Did the defendant confess? No.

760
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,680
Was his act counter-revolutionary?

761
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:12,600
When and where did the defendant corrupt the people of Paris?

762
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:19,449
During arguments? No. It would be here.

763
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,710
During the reading and writing lessons in the orphanage, right?

764
01:42:25,779 --> 01:42:27,140
During arguments? No.

765
01:42:29,619 --> 01:42:31,539
Maybe they went during- yeah, in the orphanage.

766
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,350
Was his act counter-revolutionary?

767
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:43,029
I mean, yeah. Yeah, close.

768
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:46,229
I'm not going to kill you.

769
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:57,189
All right, acquittal. Wow. That would be bad.

770
01:42:57,189 --> 01:43:01,239
Prison. Death penalty.

771
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,000
Nah, I can get some points of revolutionary here.

772
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,359
But I need to do- the common folk need to be appeased.

773
01:43:09,079 --> 01:43:18,020
The people want blood, but they're not going to get it because

774
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:24,460
the revolutionaries will actually come and remove me from office.

775
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:27,020
The joke fucked you up so bad. Yeah.

776
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,930
Sorry. Prison.

777
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:42,520
Sorry, family. That could be anybody's name.

778
01:43:45,739 --> 01:43:48,859
I sentence Citizen Claude Pochard to prison.

779
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,979
Lead the condemned out.

780
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:55,140
He saved that priest!

781
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,699
He showed mercy to an enemy of the revolution.

782
01:43:58,579 --> 01:44:01,699
He ought to have been killed. I have nothing else to say.

783
01:44:02,579 --> 01:44:06,920
All right. Correct, correct, correct.

784
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:07,800
Three to three. Good job.

785
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,760
My influence went up. My reputation went up.

786
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,000
I played that pretty much by the book.

787
01:44:14,069 --> 01:44:15,750
So for the next case, unfortunately,

788
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:18,550
I'm going to have to play some politics here and we need-

789
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:24,619
I need- we need to sway people towards like execution for them.

790
01:44:24,619 --> 01:44:34,970
Cool. This game's fun.

791
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,880
I like this. This is actually really interesting.

792
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:46,329
Okay, so I still- I'm still at the bottom here.

793
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:56,390
Take him away.

794
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,750
Is it as fun as Sekiro?

795
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,909
I can't start Sekiro three hours from now.

796
01:45:01,319 --> 01:45:03,640
I'll be almost five hours into the stream.

797
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,119
I can't start Sekiro.

798
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,880
I'm gonna have to- if I start Sekiro in three or four hours,

799
01:45:10,520 --> 01:45:15,239
I will actually burn out for tomorrow and I won't stream tomorrow.

800
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,399
I'll be- I'll be live for like 16 hours or something.

801
01:45:17,399 --> 01:45:18,920
It'll- no, I can't.

802
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:30,659
Who's that? Who's that?

803
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:48,500
That was a dad. No, it's not.

804
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,899
One fool spewed out one word to many.

805
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:52,819
The other fired a musket.

806
01:45:54,020 --> 01:46:04,300
They fought for freedom, each for their own.

807
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:11,319
The man who was forbidden to shoot.

808
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:17,420
Commander Buell paid the highest price for our decisions.

809
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:21,340
The defender who kept watch over ordinary citizens,

810
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,579
but was denied the right to protect himself.

811
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:29,130
Whether I like it or not, his death is also my fault.

812
01:46:34,659 --> 01:46:41,670
That's because I've rejected the- we made a nice profit.

813
01:46:41,670 --> 01:46:43,109
There was a chance of prosperity.

814
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:49,050
Why would the Renard family want to take over your shop, grandpapa?

815
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,850
For profit and power.

816
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:54,170
It's always the same and it's no different in these times.

817
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:58,699
We get the same like hair energy coming to realize.

818
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:04,520
Today is about equality so that not only the aristocrats can live with dignity.

819
01:47:07,699 --> 01:47:09,939
Grow up. Grow up, boy.

820
01:47:09,939 --> 01:47:14,340
I only saw the truth when they attempted to sentence my son, your uncle, to death.

821
01:47:14,979 --> 01:47:18,899
It suddenly dawned on me that the only things that mattered were the power I never had,

822
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:21,220
and the connections I never cared for.

823
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:26,149
You wanted to be righteous while the injustice spread like a plague?

824
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:28,710
You should not- you should not be sorry for that.

825
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,310
Sorry, I misspoke there, dad.

826
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:33,300
Now this is my son.

827
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,220
Who is this- wait, who's the kid?

828
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:35,699
Who am I?

829
01:47:36,819 --> 01:47:38,020
No, that's the kid.

830
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:39,060
Where's me?

831
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,340
Which one of these is me?

832
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:44,869
That's me.

833
01:47:44,869 --> 01:47:45,590
No, that's me.

834
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:52,970
Why does my kid look older than me?

835
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,979
He's dressed like an old man too.

836
01:47:55,979 --> 01:47:59,579
I am not, but I would rather your brother live so that I still had two sons.

837
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:00,699
No, this is dad.

838
01:48:11,130 --> 01:48:13,239
He looks different in court.

839
01:48:13,239 --> 01:48:14,760
You have a brother, daddy?

840
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:15,880
Where is he?

841
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:22,329
He died a long time ago before you were born.

842
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:25,640
Why did he die?

843
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,800
Do not talk so much while eating.

844
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,159
Your uncle went to war and died in battle.

845
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:37,239
Your generation will soon realize the extent of the damage we inflicted upon the world.

846
01:48:38,039 --> 01:48:43,260
In the past, decent people like Puchard never had to worry about courts or tribunals.

847
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:49,609
But now, do you even consider the possibility that Puchard was guilty?

848
01:48:49,609 --> 01:48:52,489
No, not Mr. Puchard!

849
01:48:52,489 --> 01:48:55,859
He was no guiltier than any of us, son.

850
01:48:55,859 --> 01:48:57,619
Keep an eye on the Reynards.

851
01:48:57,619 --> 01:49:06,359
Jermyn, when you stream games, do you stream with your monitor on or off?

852
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:08,819
Typically on.

853
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:19,449
I get it.

854
01:49:19,449 --> 01:49:20,170
Fuck off.

855
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:21,210
How does that sound?

856
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:22,090
Fuck off, mate.

857
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:33,579
Very rare occasion.

858
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:39,109
Why did you read that?

859
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,590
I don't know.

860
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:51,029
I'm sorry.

861
01:49:51,029 --> 01:49:51,989
That was really funny.

862
01:49:51,989 --> 01:49:52,949
I'll give you that one.

863
01:49:52,949 --> 01:49:56,260
All right.

864
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:57,859
So let's read together.

865
01:49:57,859 --> 01:49:59,300
It's been a rough couple of days.

866
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:02,859
We're going to read together.

867
01:50:02,859 --> 01:50:05,609
Some people think it's dull.

868
01:50:05,609 --> 01:50:06,489
No, no, no, no, no.

869
01:50:06,489 --> 01:50:07,210
Political debate.

870
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:11,000
I'm going to bring the sons doing political debate.

871
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:15,819
Although, influence on reputation, influence on the people.

872
01:50:15,819 --> 01:50:22,010
I need dad to be happy.

873
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:22,329
What?

874
01:50:22,329 --> 01:50:22,729
No!

875
01:50:22,729 --> 01:50:23,529
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

876
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:24,250
Hey, hey, hey.

877
01:50:25,449 --> 01:50:26,329
Oh, come on.

878
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:26,569
What?

879
01:50:26,569 --> 01:50:27,770
They're going to kill me.

880
01:50:27,770 --> 01:50:32,180
I thought dad wanted to debate politics.

881
01:50:32,819 --> 01:50:33,060
What?

882
01:50:35,909 --> 01:50:36,789
Oh, my God.

883
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:38,579
All right.

884
01:50:38,579 --> 01:50:39,539
We've got to kill.

885
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:42,840
We're going to have to just drop the guillotine on somebody, I think.

886
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:44,199
Oh, this sucks.

887
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:46,619
What's my reputation right now?

888
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,789
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is bad.

889
01:50:56,899 --> 01:50:58,100
Revolutionaries want to quittle.

890
01:50:58,739 --> 01:51:00,180
Common people want death penalty.

891
01:51:00,979 --> 01:51:02,579
I have to pee.

892
01:51:03,819 --> 01:51:04,380
Give me a minute.

893
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,180
I'm going to pee.

894
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,140
I also want to get some water.

895
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:12,869
By the way, if you weren't, if you're not aware, I have a cough,

896
01:51:12,869 --> 01:51:15,909
which if you've been here for even remotely five, 10 minutes, you'd know.

897
01:51:15,909 --> 01:51:20,390
So I'm trying to keep my vitamin C levels up, stay hydrated.

898
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:21,029
I'll be right back.

899
01:51:21,750 --> 01:54:35,539
Oh, man.

900
01:54:35,539 --> 01:54:38,489
I drank a glass of water.

901
01:54:38,489 --> 01:54:40,409
I've just been in a coughing fit this whole time.

902
01:54:41,369 --> 01:54:45,960
Oh, I was laughing my ass off.

903
01:54:46,899 --> 01:54:48,899
So remember when we played The Sims modded?

904
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:58,779
And I was when the guy was peeing and he was mid piss and he sneezed

905
01:54:58,779 --> 01:55:00,460
and like his pee stream kept going.

906
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:03,340
And somebody said, that's fucking impossible.

907
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:05,500
I was like, I don't know why I keep thinking of that.

908
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:11,640
I keep seeing that image and seeing that person in chat write that.

909
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,920
And it makes me laugh every time.

910
01:55:13,319 --> 01:55:20,840
Because I started coughing while I was peeing and you know what happens?

911
01:55:23,239 --> 01:55:28,180
The fact that that sim was just mid piss,

912
01:55:28,899 --> 01:55:32,340
sneezing, coughing, and the stream was just perfect the whole time.

913
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:38,710
All right.

914
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:39,510
Let's get back to this.

915
01:55:42,789 --> 01:55:43,189
Sorry.

916
01:55:43,189 --> 01:55:43,510
Hold on.

917
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:50,789
Okay.

918
01:55:50,789 --> 01:55:52,069
Sekiro's out now.

919
01:55:52,069 --> 01:55:53,430
Comes out in like a couple hours, doesn't it?

920
01:55:58,869 --> 01:55:59,510
Anyway, here we go.

921
01:55:59,510 --> 01:56:00,390
This is murder.

922
01:56:01,029 --> 01:56:01,430
Murder.

923
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:07,289
A tragedy occurred in one of the ten minutes by the...

924
01:56:07,289 --> 01:56:08,170
Oh my goodness.

925
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:12,760
Fuck.

926
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:16,680
I picked a great day to do a talking stream, right?

927
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:22,340
Like not at every stream is a talking stream, but a reading stream.

928
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,819
Set your VPN to Japan.

929
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:27,619
You can play it now.

930
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:34,789
Yeah, but I mean, I can't stream through a VPN.

931
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:38,149
I can't stream through a VPN.

932
01:56:38,149 --> 01:56:38,550
What are you talking about?

933
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:39,270
Why would I do that?

934
01:56:41,109 --> 01:56:42,149
That's fucking illegal.

935
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:47,739
All right.

936
01:56:47,739 --> 01:56:54,420
It's not illegal.

937
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:59,859
Yeah, but I'm talking about like pretending that I'm from Japan to stream the game early.

938
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:02,899
That's like gotta be illegal.

939
01:57:02,899 --> 01:57:04,180
You guys would put me in the guillotine.

940
01:57:07,579 --> 01:57:09,260
Yeah, no, you can't.

941
01:57:10,699 --> 01:57:15,739
I'm not sure that my internet is powerful enough to be able to stream through a VPN.

942
01:57:15,739 --> 01:57:16,539
I really don't think so.

943
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:20,039
No, we're doing that tomorrow.

944
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:23,399
Look, I got to get more vitamin C and drink more water and like go to bed early

945
01:57:23,399 --> 01:57:26,039
because tomorrow I'm going for like 10 straight hours.

946
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:26,920
You heard it here first.

947
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,399
Put the bulletin on the board.

948
01:57:31,319 --> 01:57:35,750
No, yeah, we're just hanging up like this.

949
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:37,430
I'm good here for a little while longer.

950
01:57:38,069 --> 01:57:40,649
This is interesting.

951
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:42,649
We got a whole...

952
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:46,729
Look, because I've been gone for like four days, right?

953
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:51,000
I mean, I'm going to play the absolute hell out of Sekiro.

954
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:51,960
That's like the...

955
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:53,239
I'm not going to stop playing that.

956
01:57:54,949 --> 01:57:55,350
You know what I mean?

957
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:57,270
I'm going to like be eating pizza on stream again.

958
01:57:57,909 --> 01:58:01,380
But anyways, let's go.

959
01:58:01,939 --> 01:58:02,500
Ahem.

960
01:58:03,779 --> 01:58:07,380
A tragedy occurred in one of the tenements by the scene near the point new.

961
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:10,100
The fourth floor collapsed.

962
01:58:10,979 --> 01:58:11,300
Okay.

963
01:58:11,939 --> 01:58:17,619
The tenants, horrified by the crash and ubiquitous dust, ran outside.

964
01:58:17,619 --> 01:58:20,340
Only after a few minutes did some of the braver men

965
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:23,220
run upstairs to look for survivors and remove the corpses.

966
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:23,619
Jesus.

967
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:28,739
Rubble and timber buried two families, 12 people.

968
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:31,939
Three children managed to survive by hiding beneath a wooden table.

969
01:58:32,659 --> 01:58:36,500
Neighbors dug them out and carried them to the hotel due.

970
01:58:37,899 --> 01:58:40,619
We cannot comprehend what the orphans are going through,

971
01:58:40,619 --> 01:58:42,779
and they have not eaten or spoken for two days.

972
01:58:43,500 --> 01:58:43,819
Okay.

973
01:58:45,239 --> 01:58:49,640
The owner of the house testified that he had ordered the construction of an extra floor

974
01:58:50,279 --> 01:58:51,319
a few years back.

975
01:58:52,279 --> 01:58:55,479
Works were supervised by architect Maurice Lorty.

976
01:58:56,279 --> 01:58:58,520
The National Guard found the architect,

977
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,439
who was also the construction foreman, at an address given by the owner.

978
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:08,680
Maurice Lorty was not surprised when the gendarmes knocked at his door,

979
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:11,800
and he did not resist when they handcuffed him and took him to jail.

980
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:21,859
So this is like criminal negligence, right?

981
01:59:26,869 --> 01:59:28,229
Construction of an extra floor.

982
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:30,789
All right, let's see, there's four questions.

983
01:59:30,789 --> 01:59:32,630
All right, so we got additional floor.

984
01:59:38,539 --> 01:59:41,819
So we've got the corpses, that's the victim.

985
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:46,699
Collapse floor is the circumstances.

986
01:59:46,699 --> 01:59:47,659
Oh no.

987
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:52,579
Isn't that the, that's like the additional floor

988
01:59:52,579 --> 01:59:55,300
caused potentially the circumstances of the collapse floor.

989
01:59:55,859 --> 02:00:13,720
All right, crowded flat.

990
02:00:14,899 --> 02:00:16,180
That's the circumstance.

991
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:17,539
Okay, yeah, I got it, I got it.

992
02:00:18,579 --> 02:00:19,380
I got it, I got it.

993
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:21,699
Get a dictionary, I'm fine.

994
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:26,630
Okay, so common folk want death penalty.

995
02:00:26,869 --> 02:00:29,029
I have to sway towards the death penalty.

996
02:00:29,829 --> 02:00:32,069
The people, the people are angry and scared

997
02:00:32,069 --> 02:00:34,310
and expect someone to be punished for this tragedy.

998
02:00:36,649 --> 02:00:37,130
Your name?

999
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:40,659
Maurice Lorty, Mr. Judge.

1000
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:42,859
Do you build houses?

1001
02:00:43,659 --> 02:00:44,619
That's right.

1002
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:47,819
I've earned my living from construction and renovation for many years now.

1003
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:51,289
Did the floor collapse because of your mistake?

1004
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,130
I don't know.

1005
02:00:53,130 --> 02:00:55,050
I have worked at many houses since then.

1006
02:00:56,060 --> 02:00:58,220
There's children are dead because of you.

1007
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:01,689
Let me just say that I always build the best,

1008
02:01:01,689 --> 02:01:03,289
I always build the best work I can.

1009
02:01:07,109 --> 02:01:10,229
Uh, citizen, a few years ago you were assigned

1010
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:11,909
to perform some construction work.

1011
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:15,770
It was nine years ago.

1012
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:18,250
I was supposed to remove the roof, add one floor,

1013
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:19,369
then build a new roof.

1014
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,840
Is that a hard task?

1015
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:26,340
It is known that it is easier to build a new

1016
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:28,260
than to improve something already there.

1017
02:01:29,989 --> 02:01:32,470
Did the owner have any objections regarding your work?

1018
02:01:33,819 --> 02:01:36,939
If he did, I would have made as many corrections as necessary.

1019
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:40,229
Which floor was built by you?

1020
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:43,029
The attic, the fourth.

1021
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:45,029
Before that, the third floor was the attic.

1022
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,810
Oh, I'm ready.

1023
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:54,899
They're sharpening the blade.

1024
02:01:55,539 --> 02:02:02,069
Citizen, with your knowledge of construction,

1025
02:02:02,069 --> 02:02:03,909
what could have led to this tragedy?

1026
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:08,489
I can't be sure.

1027
02:02:08,489 --> 02:02:12,170
Pests, poor materials, too much load on the structure.

1028
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,770
Every house is different.

1029
02:02:13,770 --> 02:02:14,890
This should have been checked

1030
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:16,729
before the room fell on people's heads.

1031
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:20,039
You did not mention a construction error.

1032
02:02:21,159 --> 02:02:23,159
Yes, unfortunately, that could also happen.

1033
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:24,359
I could have made a mistake

1034
02:02:24,359 --> 02:02:26,680
and my calculations are wrongly assessed

1035
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,960
the quality of the timber.

1036
02:02:29,369 --> 02:02:30,489
You are not denying it.

1037
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:33,210
If you judge that I have contributed

1038
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:34,329
to the death of those children,

1039
02:02:34,329 --> 02:02:36,250
I will accept whatever punishment you choose.

1040
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:39,609
Two weeks ago, a disease took my wife

1041
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:41,529
and I no longer care what happens to me.

1042
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:43,770
Oh, fuck.

1043
02:02:55,239 --> 02:02:56,439
Did you talk to the tenants,

1044
02:02:56,439 --> 02:02:58,439
the ones that pulled the victims from the rubble?

1045
02:03:00,869 --> 02:03:02,869
They came to me in the night angry and hurt.

1046
02:03:02,869 --> 02:03:04,550
I understand their pain is too...

1047
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:05,510
I too have children.

1048
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:07,029
Answer my question.

1049
02:03:07,029 --> 02:03:07,909
Did you talk to them?

1050
02:03:08,859 --> 02:03:10,539
No, I was forced to hide inside my house

1051
02:03:10,539 --> 02:03:11,579
and close the window shutters

1052
02:03:11,579 --> 02:03:12,939
because they were throwing stones.

1053
02:03:13,659 --> 02:03:16,460
So the building collapsed because of your mistake

1054
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,819
and you did not even have the courage

1055
02:03:17,819 --> 02:03:19,260
to talk to the victims?

1056
02:03:20,140 --> 02:03:21,260
I'm a coward, I know.

1057
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:23,850
How did they know where to go?

1058
02:03:24,869 --> 02:03:25,750
I don't know.

1059
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:28,229
Only the owner of the tenement knew my address.

1060
02:03:30,579 --> 02:03:32,100
Oh, fuck, we're about to prove...

1061
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:34,020
We're about to call in the witness and like prove...

1062
02:03:48,859 --> 02:03:58,550
All right, but the thing is,

1063
02:03:59,829 --> 02:04:00,710
how long in prison?

1064
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:02,710
Can I say like just like a little while?

1065
02:04:07,619 --> 02:04:09,140
If this drops, I die.

1066
02:04:13,689 --> 02:04:15,050
Prison's the most...

1067
02:04:15,050 --> 02:04:17,609
Okay, I'm going to do prison just because it's...

1068
02:04:19,770 --> 02:04:21,369
I'm corrupt as hell,

1069
02:04:21,369 --> 02:04:23,210
but you have to understand something.

1070
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:24,010
They're going to come after me.

1071
02:04:24,649 --> 02:04:30,310
Did the defendant confess to the crimes?

1072
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:31,590
Yeah, kind of.

1073
02:04:32,149 --> 02:04:34,180
Does he act counter-revolutionary?

1074
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:34,680
No.

1075
02:04:36,899 --> 02:04:37,619
Call the witness?

1076
02:04:37,619 --> 02:04:38,739
Yeah, but if the witness...

1077
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:42,819
If the witness comes in and says a bunch of shit,

1078
02:04:43,539 --> 02:04:46,500
then the people might not be so inclined.

1079
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:50,460
Are you the owner of the house where the floor collapsed?

1080
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:52,359
Yes.

1081
02:04:52,359 --> 02:04:53,880
The floor and the attic collapsed

1082
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,319
and fell on the rooms beneath.

1083
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,960
Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?

1084
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,890
The apartments were small, correct?

1085
02:05:07,479 --> 02:05:10,949
Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?

1086
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:13,510
They said something about squeaky floors,

1087
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:16,310
but that's not unusual as they squeak at my place too.

1088
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,810
So what?

1089
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:19,319
Did you inspect the floors?

1090
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:21,340
I planned to,

1091
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:23,579
but this tragedy happened before I was able to.

1092
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:26,649
Thank God he managed to take their money.

1093
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:34,819
So no, so he didn't.

1094
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:50,310
According to the witness,

1095
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:52,710
did the tenants complain about anything, squeaky floors?

1096
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:03,770
All right, prison, death penalty.

1097
02:06:03,770 --> 02:06:05,689
Prison is probably the best choice

1098
02:06:05,689 --> 02:06:06,890
because he might not have...

1099
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:11,939
Kill him for the love of God,

1100
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:13,939
but my conscience is at stake here.

1101
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:17,270
Squeaky kill is the best,

1102
02:06:18,069 --> 02:06:26,380
but kill him because he mad at squeaky floors?

1103
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:27,600
Really?

1104
02:06:35,989 --> 02:06:53,579
He just said something fucking horrible.

1105
02:06:53,579 --> 02:06:55,659
Architect Lordy shall be sent to the guillotine

1106
02:06:55,659 --> 02:06:58,060
for the terrible tragic death of two families.

1107
02:06:58,060 --> 02:06:59,340
Long live justice!

1108
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,640
Incorrect.

1109
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:05,779
And I did a good job.

1110
02:07:05,779 --> 02:07:06,659
Okay, here we go.

1111
02:07:07,460 --> 02:07:11,460
I got some common folk reputation.

1112
02:07:12,779 --> 02:07:14,140
Let's try to make...

1113
02:07:14,140 --> 02:07:15,020
Let's do the speech.

1114
02:07:16,619 --> 02:07:17,500
Take a breather.

1115
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:18,779
No, I have a cough.

1116
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:22,789
It's been annoying the last two days.

1117
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:25,109
Maybe I could win the heart of the crowd.

1118
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:28,359
They're irritated.

1119
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,710
Skip...

1120
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:31,909
Speak to the common folk.

1121
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:35,880
Okay, so the crime...

1122
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:37,720
Carelessness.

1123
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,399
I would say carelessness, right?

1124
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:44,470
So they're bullheaded right now.

1125
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:46,579
Aggression.

1126
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:49,640
The defendant...

1127
02:07:50,359 --> 02:07:51,399
Let's reveal this.

1128
02:07:51,399 --> 02:07:52,119
This is attached.

1129
02:07:52,119 --> 02:07:52,840
Let's manipulate.

1130
02:07:55,859 --> 02:07:57,539
Manipulate and then bullheaded.

1131
02:07:57,539 --> 02:07:59,619
We can do either aggression or humility.

1132
02:07:59,619 --> 02:08:00,260
Aggression, right?

1133
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:04,310
And the crime would be carelessness.

1134
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:06,439
So that's...

1135
02:08:13,619 --> 02:08:14,340
I think that's good.

1136
02:08:21,880 --> 02:08:23,319
Carelessness is the approach.

1137
02:08:25,619 --> 02:08:27,060
Well, isn't that the crime?

1138
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:32,310
Let's just see.

1139
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,869
Attached.

1140
02:08:32,869 --> 02:08:35,189
Well, manipulation again.

1141
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:39,109
Manipulation, manipulation, and then aggression.

1142
02:08:39,829 --> 02:08:51,100
That makes sense.

1143
02:08:51,819 --> 02:08:57,529
There we go.

1144
02:08:57,529 --> 02:08:58,329
Yeah, I was right.

1145
02:08:59,210 --> 02:08:59,770
That one would...

1146
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:00,729
This one was strong.

1147
02:09:00,729 --> 02:09:01,609
This one would have been okay.

1148
02:09:02,489 --> 02:09:03,449
So now we're going to do...

1149
02:09:03,449 --> 02:09:05,850
So it's manipulation, manipulation, aggression.

1150
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:07,420
Let's go.

1151
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:10,949
Manipulation.

1152
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:15,670
Future generations will remember that we were not cowards.

1153
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:19,670
They will remember us delivering punishment for such heinous crimes.

1154
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:21,670
All right?

1155
02:09:21,670 --> 02:09:22,949
Defendant, manipulate.

1156
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:27,609
Will you just stand there and allow criminals to tell you what to do?

1157
02:09:28,329 --> 02:09:30,840
And then aggression.

1158
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,899
You have gained power in France.

1159
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:36,380
Now spill the blood of those who oppose the Republic.

1160
02:09:38,229 --> 02:09:39,029
Oh, come on.

1161
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:41,609
Oh, come on.

1162
02:09:41,609 --> 02:09:41,850
What?

1163
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:48,920
That was perfect.

1164
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:50,520
That was strong, perfect, perfect.

1165
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:57,829
Is this justice?

1166
02:09:57,829 --> 02:09:59,989
Will someone punish the owner of the house?

1167
02:10:05,029 --> 02:10:10,390
Do I have to do it?

1168
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:11,350
Can somebody else do it?

1169
02:10:11,989 --> 02:10:23,060
What's that famous line?

1170
02:10:23,779 --> 02:10:26,060
The one that carries out a sentence.

1171
02:10:26,779 --> 02:10:28,939
Should carry out a sword, right?

1172
02:10:32,899 --> 02:10:34,180
He's ours.

1173
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:36,439
Uh-oh.

1174
02:10:36,439 --> 02:10:38,729
Uh.

1175
02:10:38,729 --> 02:10:43,210
There can be no more demeaning experience for revolutionary Paris

1176
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:45,689
than the escape of Citizen Capet.

1177
02:10:45,689 --> 02:10:48,729
He escaped, slipped right from their hands,

1178
02:10:48,729 --> 02:10:51,529
and the revolution now seems feeble and weak.

1179
02:10:51,529 --> 02:10:55,529
The people resemble a child that could easily be duped by anyone.

1180
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:58,890
However, the Republic quickly composed itself

1181
02:10:58,890 --> 02:11:00,890
thanks to a postmaster and his people

1182
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:04,329
who were able to catch the fugitives escaping to Montmidi.

1183
02:11:04,329 --> 02:11:07,930
Ordinary citizens led to the fall of a monarch.

1184
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:10,409
You will have a chance to serve the Republic as well,

1185
02:11:10,409 --> 02:11:13,930
for Citizen Capet will face the tribunal tomorrow.

1186
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:16,250
You will choose how he will be remembered

1187
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:20,170
as a traitor and a coward or as an unlucky statesman.

1188
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:24,420
If it were for the prison guards to decide,

1189
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:26,340
there would be only one outcome.

1190
02:11:31,130 --> 02:11:33,670
Allow the guards to rough up Citizen Capet

1191
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:35,270
or leave him alone until the trial.

1192
02:11:35,909 --> 02:11:37,979
Does this get me points with people?

1193
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:53,020
I'll get points with the people.

1194
02:11:54,579 --> 02:11:55,539
I need those right now.

1195
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:04,300
Or the fair trial.

1196
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:16,020
Let's have trial.

1197
02:12:16,819 --> 02:12:20,810
Get him out of here.

1198
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:21,930
Work on tomorrow's trial.

1199
02:12:22,569 --> 02:12:23,609
Opening that at the theater.

1200
02:12:24,329 --> 02:12:27,770
Let's go to the theater.

1201
02:12:29,239 --> 02:12:30,359
Fuck, am I getting worse?

1202
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:31,079
I might be.

1203
02:12:31,079 --> 02:12:31,720
This is bad.

1204
02:12:32,439 --> 02:12:36,979
I didn't feel this coffee earlier before it started.

1205
02:12:37,619 --> 02:12:39,800
Work on tomorrow's trial.

1206
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:40,439
I think I've...

1207
02:12:40,439 --> 02:12:44,550
No, I have to get this up.

1208
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:46,359
Evening with granddad.

1209
02:12:46,359 --> 02:12:48,439
Sit down with your father and listen to stories of days.

1210
02:12:48,439 --> 02:12:50,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

1211
02:12:54,539 --> 02:12:56,220
Where we can lose some of that.

1212
02:12:56,220 --> 02:12:58,739
You can lose some of the sun, that's fine.

1213
02:12:58,739 --> 02:13:09,529
Listen to grandpa ramble.

1214
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:14,810
There he is.

1215
02:13:16,439 --> 02:13:17,000
The king.

1216
02:13:21,930 --> 02:13:24,649
The people want death penalty.

1217
02:13:24,649 --> 02:13:26,409
The revolutionaries want death penalty.

1218
02:13:26,409 --> 02:13:29,289
The family wants prison and nobody wants acquittal.

1219
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:33,609
Okay.

1220
02:13:36,729 --> 02:13:40,010
My lord, should any reason appear,

1221
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:41,770
shoot the rebels without hesitation.

1222
02:13:42,329 --> 02:13:43,930
Just as his majesty ordered,

1223
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:46,810
have no mercy for they shall have none either.

1224
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:49,180
VF Bugleberry.

1225
02:13:49,819 --> 02:14:00,439
Counterrevolution, treason, fraud,

1226
02:14:00,439 --> 02:14:02,760
advocating monarchy and neglect of duty.

1227
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:07,500
What's in here?

1228
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,560
Victory.

1229
02:14:14,199 --> 02:14:17,079
Okay, minus four reputation.

1230
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,930
Plus one revolutionary endorsement.

1231
02:14:23,909 --> 02:14:26,380
My reputation is so bad.

1232
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:29,939
Any more notifications?

1233
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:32,060
All right.

1234
02:14:33,529 --> 02:14:36,729
Louis Capet, I hereby open your trial.

1235
02:14:36,729 --> 02:14:38,649
Answer the questions when you are asked.

1236
02:14:42,939 --> 02:14:45,020
Capet is the name of one of my ancestors.

1237
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:47,020
My name is Louis August de Bourbeau.

1238
02:14:49,369 --> 02:14:51,850
That may have been your name before you raised your hand

1239
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:53,770
against the people you had sworn to defend.

1240
02:14:55,050 --> 02:14:57,609
As a king, I have never done a thing against my people.

1241
02:14:57,609 --> 02:14:59,210
I love them and I still do.

1242
02:15:00,899 --> 02:15:01,539
Objection!

1243
02:15:01,539 --> 02:15:02,739
Ah, that hurt my throat.

1244
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,939
I'm just gonna say the word.

1245
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:14,659
Objection!

1246
02:15:15,220 --> 02:15:17,779
There's evidence of Louis Capet's treason

1247
02:15:17,779 --> 02:15:19,300
against the people of France.

1248
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:21,619
He should be tried as a foreigner and an enemy,

1249
02:15:21,619 --> 02:15:22,899
not a citizen of the Republic.

1250
02:15:23,619 --> 02:15:26,119
This is the audience.

1251
02:15:26,119 --> 02:15:28,439
Questioning the defendant will stir the impatient audience.

1252
02:15:28,439 --> 02:15:31,079
Once angered, the people may even start a riot.

1253
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:35,100
I can't do voices.

1254
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,340
Drink some tea, I got something right here already.

1255
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:37,840
See?

1256
02:15:38,539 --> 02:15:39,340
It's a brick.

1257
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:40,939
I'm just like licking it with salt.

1258
02:15:43,539 --> 02:15:44,020
Let's read.

1259
02:15:48,659 --> 02:15:52,420
Compatriot Citizen Capet, previously known as King Louis,

1260
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:56,340
the ex-V.I. of France,

1261
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:01,529
must be punished for conspiring against the people of France.

1262
02:16:02,649 --> 02:16:06,890
Louis Capet tried to defend his absolute authority

1263
02:16:06,890 --> 02:16:10,489
by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly

1264
02:16:10,489 --> 02:16:11,529
and the people of France.

1265
02:16:12,569 --> 02:16:14,729
We all remember July of 1789,

1266
02:16:14,729 --> 02:16:18,250
he gathered an army, fifteen foreign regiments,

1267
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:20,489
and ordered them to surround Paris.

1268
02:16:21,289 --> 02:16:23,529
Soldiers led by Baron de Bessignolles

1269
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:26,729
were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens

1270
02:16:26,729 --> 02:16:28,409
defending the reforms.

1271
02:16:28,409 --> 02:16:29,609
And so they did.

1272
02:16:29,609 --> 02:16:32,170
The Royal German Regiment drew first blood.

1273
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:37,049
After the plot failed, Louis tried to flee the country

1274
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:41,049
with his family and scheme with foreign monarchs abroad.

1275
02:16:41,770 --> 02:16:45,530
Is that not the reason he took flight from the Tuileries

1276
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:49,129
one night in June of 1791 using someone else's passport?

1277
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:52,489
Was he not heading to Montmedie

1278
02:16:52,489 --> 02:16:54,170
where his loyal armies were stationed

1279
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:55,610
ready to take him to Austria?

1280
02:16:56,409 --> 02:16:58,329
If it were not for Postmaster Dore,

1281
02:16:59,659 --> 02:17:01,819
the scheme could have ended tragically for us.

1282
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:04,739
Louis Capet will never abandon the thought

1283
02:17:04,739 --> 02:17:06,579
of suppressing the revolution by force.

1284
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:10,020
Before the events of 1792, he gave orders

1285
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:13,139
for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Tuileries to be doubled.

1286
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:17,139
He conducted a public muster in front of horrified citizens.

1287
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:18,819
The people had no choice.

1288
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:21,940
They had to act before Capet attacked

1289
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:24,180
citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness

1290
02:17:24,180 --> 02:17:26,739
was shot at, even after Capet's escape

1291
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:27,940
to the National Assembly.

1292
02:17:28,899 --> 02:17:31,620
And evidence in order issued by Marshal de Broglie

1293
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:32,979
to Baron de Bessignolles.

1294
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:37,670
Oh, god damn it.

1295
02:17:38,629 --> 02:17:41,260
I'm starting to turn into dust.

1296
02:17:42,899 --> 02:17:43,299
All right.

1297
02:17:43,299 --> 02:17:46,389
So, hey, we got anything else?

1298
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:53,420
Equitable.

1299
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:56,620
If I equate them, I'm dead.

1300
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:03,059
If I press this button, then that's it for me.

1301
02:18:03,059 --> 02:18:04,500
I'm going to, they're going to throw

1302
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,780
like a fucking spear at me.

1303
02:18:06,579 --> 02:18:10,790
So let's, let's start the questions by,

1304
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:13,350
and by that, I mean, let's take a look what we've got.

1305
02:18:14,069 --> 02:18:16,549
Oh, there's a lot.

1306
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:17,989
Ten questions to reveal.

1307
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:20,069
Surrounding, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1308
02:18:20,069 --> 02:18:21,829
Suppress the revolution is an accusation.

1309
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:24,149
Doubling the size of the guard method

1310
02:18:24,149 --> 02:18:26,389
shooting civilians accusation.

1311
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:28,069
Okay.

1312
02:18:28,069 --> 02:18:29,270
Defending his authority.

1313
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:30,469
Gathering armed forces.

1314
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:35,899
The attempt to flee the country is,

1315
02:18:35,899 --> 02:18:38,139
that's a, that's a motive.

1316
02:18:38,139 --> 02:18:39,260
Fake passport is evidence.

1317
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:43,750
No evidence there?

1318
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:53,479
Shit.

1319
02:18:53,479 --> 02:18:54,440
I was just going to kill him.

1320
02:18:55,239 --> 02:18:56,120
Fake passport.

1321
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:57,159
Okay.

1322
02:18:57,959 --> 02:19:00,600
International plot is motive.

1323
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:03,459
How is that?

1324
02:19:03,459 --> 02:19:06,579
How is the proportional plot not the motive?

1325
02:19:06,579 --> 02:19:08,180
Isn't that like the plot?

1326
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:16,950
Suppressing the revolution is the motive.

1327
02:19:21,399 --> 02:19:24,040
International plot, you're accused.

1328
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:25,959
Suppressing the revolution is the motive.

1329
02:19:27,190 --> 02:19:27,829
Is the method.

1330
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:32,100
No, that's what it is.

1331
02:19:32,899 --> 02:19:33,219
Okay.

1332
02:19:36,819 --> 02:19:37,299
Witness.

1333
02:19:37,299 --> 02:19:39,139
Postmaster DeRay was a witness.

1334
02:19:40,819 --> 02:19:42,100
Gathering the armed forces.

1335
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:42,819
That's a method.

1336
02:19:43,979 --> 02:19:45,420
Surrounding the city of Paris.

1337
02:19:45,420 --> 02:19:47,020
That is an accusation.

1338
02:19:47,020 --> 02:19:51,770
Suppressing the revolution.

1339
02:19:51,770 --> 02:19:53,610
Doubling the size of the guard is also a,

1340
02:19:53,610 --> 02:19:54,809
they're a method or an accusation.

1341
02:19:57,639 --> 02:20:03,639
That's also a method.

1342
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:05,079
What's the third question?

1343
02:20:05,079 --> 02:20:05,879
There could be two here?

1344
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:12,659
This isn't a game.

1345
02:20:12,659 --> 02:20:13,540
This is homework.

1346
02:20:15,139 --> 02:20:17,829
All right.

1347
02:20:17,829 --> 02:20:22,459
So this is making me feel tense.

1348
02:20:22,459 --> 02:20:23,659
This is making, I'm going to sneeze.

1349
02:20:24,299 --> 02:20:26,059
I'm trying to figure out how to do that

1350
02:20:26,059 --> 02:20:28,860
without being annoying on stream.

1351
02:20:29,659 --> 02:20:34,040
Somebody just gave 100 bucks too.

1352
02:20:35,739 --> 02:20:38,940
Cora Monster gave $100, 10,000 bits.

1353
02:20:38,940 --> 02:20:39,579
Thank you so much.

1354
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:43,829
100 large bits.

1355
02:20:46,379 --> 02:20:47,819
Hey, Jerma, I got accepted to the

1356
02:20:47,819 --> 02:20:50,139
studio arts program at a college I applied to.

1357
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:52,059
Well, that's awesome.

1358
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:53,979
First of all, congratulations to that.

1359
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:55,899
Your own brand of creativity

1360
02:20:55,899 --> 02:20:57,500
has been really inspiring for me.

1361
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,020
And your Discord channel has given me

1362
02:20:59,020 --> 02:21:00,700
a great outlet to share the stuff I draw.

1363
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:02,700
Your streams have been very helpful

1364
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,059
in de-stressing during the time

1365
02:21:04,059 --> 02:21:05,579
I was getting ready to apply.

1366
02:21:05,579 --> 02:21:07,579
And I'm very thankful for your streams.

1367
02:21:08,139 --> 02:21:09,260
I say, Jerma, one guy.

1368
02:21:10,139 --> 02:21:12,809
That's fucking incredible.

1369
02:21:14,340 --> 02:21:15,780
I'm so happy that you got accepted.

1370
02:21:16,500 --> 02:21:18,950
It's a great feeling.

1371
02:21:20,409 --> 02:21:21,129
Do good work.

1372
02:21:22,389 --> 02:21:23,110
Stay focused.

1373
02:21:23,750 --> 02:21:25,620
Have a good time.

1374
02:21:25,620 --> 02:21:29,299
Glad you can hang out here and de-stress.

1375
02:21:29,299 --> 02:21:33,139
And thank you for the $100.

1376
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:36,250
That is an absolute shitload of money.

1377
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:40,760
All right.

1378
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:47,659
So on top of we're going forward here, art.

1379
02:21:47,659 --> 02:21:48,139
Yeah, art.

1380
02:21:48,139 --> 02:21:50,520
No, that's there are a lot of

1381
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,360
talented fucking artists that are here.

1382
02:21:52,360 --> 02:21:53,159
I've said it before.

1383
02:21:54,120 --> 02:21:58,739
Streamers stealing money from poor art students.

1384
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:03,340
Buy some pencils and some paintbrushes,

1385
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:05,500
some crayons and some pastels

1386
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:09,780
and some textbooks.

1387
02:22:09,780 --> 02:22:11,540
Suppressing the revolution is a method,

1388
02:22:11,540 --> 02:22:12,979
is a motive, it's an accusation.

1389
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,940
Doubling the size of the guard is a method.

1390
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:19,340
Suppressing the revolution is a motive.

1391
02:22:24,069 --> 02:22:24,870
It's an accusation.

1392
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:27,799
I'm getting fucking worse.

1393
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:29,239
Shit.

1394
02:22:29,239 --> 02:22:30,440
Am I really going to have to like

1395
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:31,879
cut this stream short?

1396
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:35,819
God damn it.

1397
02:22:40,360 --> 02:22:43,399
Does the itchy, you have to cough now

1398
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:45,159
is happening more often.

1399
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:46,760
All right, we're good.

1400
02:22:47,319 --> 02:22:49,670
I missed one.

1401
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:53,000
That's a motive.

1402
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,040
I told you it was a motive.

1403
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:55,159
Everybody said that I was wrong.

1404
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:57,020
All right.

1405
02:22:57,020 --> 02:22:57,819
Who issued the...

1406
02:22:57,819 --> 02:22:59,100
Let's go right off the bat.

1407
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:00,139
Top questions.

1408
02:23:00,139 --> 02:23:01,500
You're on my show.

1409
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:03,659
Who issued the order to fire at the citizens?

1410
02:23:06,010 --> 02:23:09,610
Either Marshal de Broglie or Baron de Bissenbaum.

1411
02:23:09,610 --> 02:23:11,850
The one responsible should be the one standing here

1412
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:14,729
as he was not authorized to issue such orders.

1413
02:23:15,959 --> 02:23:16,840
Really?

1414
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:18,120
Not according to this document

1415
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,639
it was signed by the Marshal.

1416
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:24,280
Marshal de Broglie went too far and lied to us all.

1417
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:27,079
I swear on my crown I did not issue that order.

1418
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:30,780
De Broglie is a sworn monarchist

1419
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:33,420
and was given an army to suppress the revolution.

1420
02:23:33,420 --> 02:23:35,739
Would he work on his own without Capet's blessing?

1421
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:39,479
People sometimes do stupid things.

1422
02:23:47,659 --> 02:23:49,420
Has the accused ever considered Paris

1423
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:51,020
and its citizens to be his enemies?

1424
02:23:51,739 --> 02:23:56,250
Absolutely not.

1425
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:58,010
I asked that you explain the question.

1426
02:23:59,290 --> 02:24:03,930
How can you deny it if you do not understand the question?

1427
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:05,850
Your army surrounded Paris.

1428
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:07,850
Is that not what you do to your enemies?

1429
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:13,639
My soldiers were there only to ensure public order

1430
02:24:13,639 --> 02:24:15,559
while the National Assembly was in session.

1431
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:19,989
Adequate forces were already present in Paris.

1432
02:24:19,989 --> 02:24:20,790
Was that not enough?

1433
02:24:24,629 --> 02:24:30,899
Who helped you suppress the revolution?

1434
02:24:30,899 --> 02:24:34,010
Frederick William II?

1435
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,889
Francis II?

1436
02:24:34,889 --> 02:24:35,610
Catherine II?

1437
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:39,209
Or maybe it was somebody that wasn't a two in their name.

1438
02:24:39,209 --> 02:24:42,329
Maybe it was the guy with the three or the four.

1439
02:24:43,219 --> 02:24:44,500
Charlie IV, huh?

1440
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:45,139
Was it four?

1441
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:47,700
Justice awaits them as well.

1442
02:24:49,129 --> 02:24:50,409
Nonsense all of it.

1443
02:24:50,409 --> 02:24:53,049
I only desire to take my family out of Paris

1444
02:24:53,049 --> 02:24:55,530
as I did not wish for them to suffer house arrest.

1445
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:58,540
We all know the European monarchs

1446
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:02,219
despise our ideals of freedom, equality, and brotherhood.

1447
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:05,020
Am I to understand that you try to prepare

1448
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:07,020
a joint military intervention?

1449
02:25:08,040 --> 02:25:09,879
I deny any such accusation.

1450
02:25:09,879 --> 02:25:12,520
There is no evidence for such outrageous claims.

1451
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:14,520
I would never turn against my beloved France.

1452
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:18,309
Liar!

1453
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:18,950
Oh, that hurt.

1454
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:22,709
I can only go so loud before it hurts.

1455
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:25,750
He'd sell his own mother, never mind his country.

1456
02:25:27,559 --> 02:25:28,840
Wait, people want me to quit them?

1457
02:25:29,639 --> 02:25:30,760
How does that make any sense?

1458
02:25:34,739 --> 02:25:35,459
That's, no.

1459
02:25:35,459 --> 02:25:36,659
The people are getting aggressive.

1460
02:25:36,659 --> 02:25:37,780
How do I calm them down?

1461
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:40,709
How do I calm them down?

1462
02:25:43,559 --> 02:25:44,520
People are aggressive.

1463
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:46,200
What do I, is it, what am I, like, book?

1464
02:25:51,319 --> 02:25:53,159
Do I have any way to calm them down?

1465
02:25:53,959 --> 02:25:57,030
Let's relax.

1466
02:25:57,030 --> 02:25:57,909
Let's go to an easy,

1467
02:25:57,909 --> 02:25:59,909
let's go to like a softball question here.

1468
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:05,510
Was he accused planning to reclaim his authority in Paris

1469
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:07,510
and reestablish an absolute monarchy?

1470
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:09,670
Well, that's actually very inflammatory.

1471
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:11,270
That's, that's very inflammatory.

1472
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:12,149
Why would I do that?

1473
02:26:12,149 --> 02:26:13,670
According to the constitution,

1474
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:15,909
I always, yeah, this is very, very, very bad.

1475
02:26:18,389 --> 02:26:19,350
Pick red, no.

1476
02:26:20,149 --> 02:26:21,750
They're gonna fucking freak out.

1477
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,040
I am still the king.

1478
02:26:25,340 --> 02:26:27,819
Then why did you raise a number of troops in the Tuileries?

1479
02:26:30,459 --> 02:26:32,059
I feared for my family's life.

1480
02:26:32,059 --> 02:26:34,540
It is not a mystery that the citizens of Paris

1481
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:37,579
were incited to seize the palace and capture us,

1482
02:26:37,579 --> 02:26:39,659
especially as it was Mr. Danton's goal.

1483
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:44,420
Ah, it is clear then that the guard

1484
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,819
were organized against the citizens of Paris,

1485
02:26:46,819 --> 02:26:48,979
many of whom did fall in the Tuileries.

1486
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:52,020
Against violence and disorder?

1487
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:54,020
Mr. Tinville, not against my people.

1488
02:26:54,819 --> 02:26:59,459
Who is responsible for the delivery

1489
02:26:59,459 --> 02:27:01,780
of the passport of the man called Pinet?

1490
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:08,250
My butler.

1491
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:10,090
I ordered him to prepare all the formalities

1492
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:11,450
regarding travel to Montmedy.

1493
02:27:13,819 --> 02:27:15,100
The city hall has not received

1494
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:18,139
any submissions from your butler.

1495
02:27:18,139 --> 02:27:19,579
I do not know what to say.

1496
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:24,340
Mr. Judge, Louis Carpets' butler

1497
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:26,500
was seen at the Austrian embassy.

1498
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:27,940
They sure took care of all the documents

1499
02:27:27,940 --> 02:27:28,739
for the defectors.

1500
02:27:30,569 --> 02:27:32,409
What's your Tinville that there's mere hearsay?

1501
02:27:32,889 --> 02:27:34,090
Who said such a thing?

1502
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:36,090
Bring him here so that I may repeat it.

1503
02:27:37,719 --> 02:27:38,520
There's no need.

1504
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:39,639
That is hard evidence,

1505
02:27:39,639 --> 02:27:41,719
especially in light of what the accused has told us.

1506
02:27:49,299 --> 02:27:50,579
What did the accused plan to do

1507
02:27:50,579 --> 02:27:52,340
with the constituents' deputies?

1508
02:27:52,899 --> 02:27:56,309
Well, we're getting close to a riot.

1509
02:27:58,040 --> 02:27:58,920
Nothing.

1510
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:02,120
The assembly that I joined on the 27th June 1789

1511
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:04,120
granted immunity to its members,

1512
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:05,879
and I intended to respect that.

1513
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:08,629
And yet you ordered your soldiers

1514
02:28:08,629 --> 02:28:11,270
to seize and imprison the deputies,

1515
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:12,790
and perhaps even execute them.

1516
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:14,739
Nonsense.

1517
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:17,219
There's no evidence of that.

1518
02:28:17,219 --> 02:28:19,459
My enemies spread rumors to get rid of me.

1519
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:22,010
We don't need evidence

1520
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:24,170
against a coward who runs from his own people.

1521
02:28:24,170 --> 02:28:25,610
That person was waiting to say that

1522
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,610
for like fucking 40 straight minutes.

1523
02:28:27,610 --> 02:28:29,209
They were practicing over and over again.

1524
02:28:29,209 --> 02:28:30,409
They were practicing it in the head,

1525
02:28:30,969 --> 02:28:32,250
and they finally had an opportunity

1526
02:28:32,250 --> 02:28:33,049
to drop out and say it.

1527
02:28:33,690 --> 02:28:37,350
All right, we're getting the imprisonment.

1528
02:28:37,909 --> 02:28:40,149
Call on the witness Jean Doré.

1529
02:28:40,870 --> 02:28:49,159
Okay, introduce yourself.

1530
02:28:50,469 --> 02:28:53,350
Jean Doré, postmaster of Saint-Main-Haut,

1531
02:28:53,350 --> 02:28:54,229
Monsieur Les Jouges.

1532
02:28:56,389 --> 02:28:57,350
Bad judge.

1533
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:57,850
What?

1534
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:02,010
What did I do?

1535
02:29:05,290 --> 02:29:08,149
Did the accused Louis Capet

1536
02:29:08,149 --> 02:29:09,430
introduce himself to the witness

1537
02:29:09,430 --> 02:29:10,469
with his full name?

1538
02:29:12,579 --> 02:29:14,659
No, he didn't introduce himself at all.

1539
02:29:14,659 --> 02:29:16,739
They only produced someone else's documents.

1540
02:29:18,059 --> 02:29:19,739
So he tried to hide his identity.

1541
02:29:20,379 --> 02:29:21,659
You could say so.

1542
02:29:21,659 --> 02:29:23,260
I used the name from the documents

1543
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:24,700
after he showed them to me.

1544
02:29:24,700 --> 02:29:25,659
He never objected.

1545
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:28,469
Then how did you learn his true identity?

1546
02:29:29,799 --> 02:29:33,239
By the image of the paper assignation.

1547
02:29:35,719 --> 02:29:37,879
Then a messenger from General Lafayette

1548
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:39,159
confirmed my suspicions.

1549
02:29:39,719 --> 02:29:41,479
I ran as fast as I could to Varennes

1550
02:29:41,479 --> 02:29:42,600
to inform the authorities.

1551
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:45,959
The accused tell anyone

1552
02:29:45,959 --> 02:29:47,399
the destination of his journey.

1553
02:29:49,129 --> 02:29:50,170
Acting like a defector,

1554
02:29:50,170 --> 02:29:51,530
was he nervous or in a hurry?

1555
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:01,620
I say, I say, foghorn, leghorn.

1556
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:11,590
That was pretty good.

1557
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:16,700
There's a lot of French names

1558
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:18,219
and it's hard to pronounce French names.

1559
02:30:18,219 --> 02:30:19,180
I don't speak French.

1560
02:30:19,739 --> 02:30:22,139
I didn't even take French 101 in high school.

1561
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:34,420
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say the top one.

1562
02:30:40,659 --> 02:30:42,659
Does anybody hear the end stream song?

1563
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:50,729
Did he tell you the destination?

1564
02:30:51,450 --> 02:30:53,770
He asked for the way to Montmidi.

1565
02:30:53,770 --> 02:30:56,569
I told him to go through Varennes and Argonne

1566
02:30:56,569 --> 02:30:58,649
and warned the coachman to be careful.

1567
02:30:58,649 --> 02:31:00,409
The road is difficult out there.

1568
02:31:01,209 --> 02:31:04,860
Would the accused like to comment

1569
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:05,819
on this testimony?

1570
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:08,540
It confirms that I had no intention of escaping.

1571
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:09,500
I was merely traveling

1572
02:31:09,500 --> 02:31:11,420
and is the right of any free citizen.

1573
02:31:30,329 --> 02:31:31,209
Bad judge.

1574
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:34,620
People's patience has its limits.

1575
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:36,219
The trial went on for too long

1576
02:31:36,219 --> 02:31:39,420
and the audience was extremely agitated.

1577
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:43,399
Okay, fine.

1578
02:31:43,399 --> 02:31:44,520
Put an ax in his head.

1579
02:31:45,319 --> 02:31:46,520
What happened in real life?

1580
02:31:47,079 --> 02:31:49,219
Because we could just cheat, right?

1581
02:31:49,219 --> 02:31:50,899
By using actual history.

1582
02:31:50,899 --> 02:31:54,340
King Louis the...

1583
02:31:54,340 --> 02:31:55,379
What happened to him?

1584
02:31:55,459 --> 02:32:02,629
He got the guillotine.

1585
02:32:02,629 --> 02:32:15,209
Okay, imagine if I just changed the history

1586
02:32:15,209 --> 02:32:15,770
and put him...

1587
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:18,149
He's still alive.

1588
02:32:22,379 --> 02:32:24,379
Oh god, that's so stupid.

1589
02:32:24,379 --> 02:32:25,260
He's still alive.

1590
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:26,299
All right, unable to know.

1591
02:32:26,299 --> 02:32:28,379
All right, just death penalty.

1592
02:32:28,379 --> 02:32:30,459
Get my reputation back up.

1593
02:32:31,829 --> 02:32:32,309
Sign it.

1594
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,139
Everybody's on board.

1595
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,719
The crowd in front of the building is enraged.

1596
02:32:43,719 --> 02:32:45,799
There may be soon a massacre.

1597
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:48,280
Oh god, a rumor has spread

1598
02:32:48,280 --> 02:32:50,520
about hidden evidence of Citizen Capay's treason.

1599
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:51,479
People have gone mad.

1600
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:53,079
What evidence?

1601
02:32:54,229 --> 02:32:55,110
I will go to them.

1602
02:32:55,110 --> 02:32:57,670
I would ask you all to stay in your seats until I return.

1603
02:32:59,059 --> 02:33:00,100
Uh oh, this is bad.

1604
02:33:03,579 --> 02:33:04,459
Why do I have to do this?

1605
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:07,530
People, what vexes you?

1606
02:33:08,329 --> 02:33:09,530
Why are you so angry?

1607
02:33:09,530 --> 02:33:10,489
Is he the one talking?

1608
02:33:12,059 --> 02:33:13,180
The king lied to us.

1609
02:33:15,639 --> 02:33:17,399
That coward ran from us.

1610
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:19,559
He'll surely run from justice as well.

1611
02:33:19,559 --> 02:33:20,440
No, we're gonna kill him.

1612
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:21,079
I already did it.

1613
02:33:21,959 --> 02:33:24,360
We found proof of the king's treachery

1614
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:26,040
in his secret iron cabinet.

1615
02:33:29,430 --> 02:33:30,629
Oh shit, okay.

1616
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:34,229
Citizen Capay shall not escape justice.

1617
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:36,309
Aggression, humility.

1618
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:37,270
How many points do I have?

1619
02:33:41,209 --> 02:33:42,489
Believe in me.

1620
02:33:43,780 --> 02:33:44,819
I'm just winging it.

1621
02:33:46,809 --> 02:33:51,129
Yeah, that, like, he's not going to escape justice.

1622
02:33:51,690 --> 02:33:55,270
The evidence from the iron cabinet will be examined,

1623
02:33:57,270 --> 02:34:01,049
manipulate, and then believe in me.

1624
02:34:02,629 --> 02:34:03,190
Humility.

1625
02:34:07,530 --> 02:34:08,489
They're all withdrawn.

1626
02:34:09,209 --> 02:34:09,770
Manipulate.

1627
02:34:11,989 --> 02:34:12,870
Full aggro.

1628
02:34:22,090 --> 02:34:23,209
All full aggro.

1629
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:27,049
No, no, this is aggressive.

1630
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,379
And then probably humility,

1631
02:34:31,379 --> 02:34:32,659
because people are already,

1632
02:34:32,659 --> 02:34:34,020
humility and then manipulation.

1633
02:34:34,579 --> 02:34:36,020
People are withdrawn.

1634
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:38,100
I can, like, do the dance, right?

1635
02:34:38,979 --> 02:34:39,700
Or humility.

1636
02:34:42,659 --> 02:34:43,540
I would even do humility.

1637
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:44,659
Maybe both of them.

1638
02:34:44,659 --> 02:34:51,139
I still have the points.

1639
02:34:51,139 --> 02:34:52,899
Yeah, the withdraw, withdrawn, withdrawn.

1640
02:34:52,899 --> 02:34:54,180
Manipulate, manipulate.

1641
02:34:54,180 --> 02:34:55,620
Aggression, manipulate, manipulate.

1642
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:58,680
Or aggression, humility, humility.

1643
02:34:59,239 --> 02:35:02,600
I'm doing it.

1644
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:03,000
Fuck it.

1645
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:03,639
Let's go.

1646
02:35:03,639 --> 02:35:04,360
Yes!

1647
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:04,600
Yes!

1648
02:35:06,059 --> 02:35:07,659
Yeah, I'm so fucking pumped up right now.

1649
02:35:07,659 --> 02:35:08,540
I'm so fucking pumped.

1650
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:12,870
The king has been imprisoned.

1651
02:35:13,430 --> 02:35:15,110
He will not escape a second time.

1652
02:35:15,829 --> 02:35:19,270
If he tries, I will kill him with my own bare hands.

1653
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:23,659
Ah, doubtful.

1654
02:35:23,659 --> 02:35:24,620
You're not that strong.

1655
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:28,059
Each new piece of evidence will be thoroughly examined.

1656
02:35:28,059 --> 02:35:30,139
The republic's standards demand nothing less.

1657
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:32,620
I shall follow them to the letter.

1658
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:34,299
Okay, I guess.

1659
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:36,219
Intrigued.

1660
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:39,020
I know that you might be angry.

1661
02:35:39,739 --> 02:35:42,540
But you have chosen your representatives to protect you.

1662
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:44,299
Believe in me.

1663
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:49,639
Yeah, they bought it.

1664
02:35:50,280 --> 02:35:52,709
Plus two reputation, plus two influence,

1665
02:35:52,709 --> 02:35:55,430
and then plus five common folk endorsement were back.

1666
02:35:59,899 --> 02:36:00,940
So what happened out there?

1667
02:36:01,659 --> 02:36:02,299
It is true.

1668
02:36:02,299 --> 02:36:04,299
Evidence of Capete's guilt has been found.

1669
02:36:05,399 --> 02:36:05,879
Really?

1670
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:11,159
Would the defendant like to explain why he concealed his secure iron cabinet

1671
02:36:11,159 --> 02:36:13,639
and the documents hidden within from the convention?

1672
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:17,350
I hid nothing from the convention.

1673
02:36:17,909 --> 02:36:20,629
No one asked me about the existence of such things.

1674
02:36:21,270 --> 02:36:24,760
You kept your correspondence well hidden under lock and key.

1675
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:29,479
It could only be retrieved only the assistance of a master locksmith.

1676
02:36:33,989 --> 02:36:37,750
Any affluent Parisian has a lockable cabinet.

1677
02:36:37,750 --> 02:36:40,149
I for one am keenly interested in locksmithing.

1678
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:44,059
Let's go.

1679
02:36:44,059 --> 02:36:44,940
Wait, is there more?

1680
02:36:46,569 --> 02:36:47,930
Oh shit, there's more?

1681
02:36:50,180 --> 02:36:51,219
No, no, no, no.

1682
02:36:51,219 --> 02:36:52,579
What is all this other stuff?

1683
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:55,219
It's like a fucking bunch of papers.

1684
02:37:00,819 --> 02:37:01,860
Get these both out of here.

1685
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:02,979
What is this?

1686
02:37:05,989 --> 02:37:06,950
Shoot the rebels.

1687
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:07,989
No, no, that's this one.

1688
02:37:07,989 --> 02:37:08,870
What is this?

1689
02:37:08,870 --> 02:37:11,909
The deputies of the so-called national assembly are to be carefully questioned,

1690
02:37:11,909 --> 02:37:15,190
and if any of them should display common sense and cease to support the assembly,

1691
02:37:15,190 --> 02:37:19,750
reward him with an extraordinarily high allowance and forward his majesty's thanks.

1692
02:37:23,399 --> 02:37:25,399
We trust that with God's grace and help,

1693
02:37:25,399 --> 02:37:31,260
his majesty will soon arrive within the imperial borders for us to grant H.M.

1694
02:37:31,260 --> 02:37:35,100
as well as our beloved sister's safety and to potentially take the steps necessary

1695
02:37:35,100 --> 02:37:38,620
to reestablish the natural European order within the borders of France.

1696
02:37:39,770 --> 02:37:43,450
His imperial majesty, the Holy Roman Emperor, King Hungary,

1697
02:37:43,450 --> 02:37:47,450
Bohemia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Slovenia, Galicia,

1698
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:49,610
Latin America, etc.

1699
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:53,770
Whoa, your country doesn't get to be added, you're in the etc.

1700
02:37:53,770 --> 02:37:54,729
I'd be pissed about that.

1701
02:37:55,690 --> 02:37:57,129
You start wars over that shit.

1702
02:37:59,020 --> 02:38:01,750
A.D. 1791, 15th of May.

1703
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:08,120
And your grace, soon we will come to your majesty's rescue.

1704
02:38:09,209 --> 02:38:14,250
However, for the time being, I implore you, Y.M.,

1705
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:17,370
to muster local troops that remain loyal.

1706
02:38:17,370 --> 02:38:22,250
I shall issue a warning to Y.M.'s subjects that any and all who dare raise a hand

1707
02:38:22,250 --> 02:38:25,770
against Y.M. would suffer the du-rest of consequences.

1708
02:38:25,770 --> 02:38:30,649
My armies await my orders to curb the tide of anarchy in Y.M.'s country.

1709
02:38:31,290 --> 02:38:36,409
Duke of Brunswick, Lundberg, Charles William Ferdinand, A.D. 1792, 9th of June.

1710
02:38:38,329 --> 02:38:39,370
That wasn't even a cough.

1711
02:38:40,569 --> 02:38:41,850
It's a pretend cough.

1712
02:38:42,889 --> 02:38:45,770
All right, get them out there, get them to the gallows, let's go.

1713
02:38:46,329 --> 02:38:47,930
How is the jury not reached what they think?

1714
02:38:48,889 --> 02:38:52,309
Wait, what?

1715
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:59,020
Must be pun- try- all right, there's more.

1716
02:38:59,579 --> 02:39:00,700
There are new questions.

1717
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:05,620
Louis Quipet tried to defend his absolute authority by plotting against

1718
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:08,100
the National Consistuate Assembly and the people of France.

1719
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:10,260
We all remember July of 1789.

1720
02:39:10,260 --> 02:39:14,739
He gathered an army, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to surround Paris.

1721
02:39:14,739 --> 02:39:19,540
Soldiers led by Baron de Bessenval were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens

1722
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:21,540
defending the reforms, and so they did.

1723
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:23,379
The royal German regiment drew first blood.

1724
02:39:24,659 --> 02:39:27,879
After the plot failed- I just read this.

1725
02:39:29,690 --> 02:39:30,489
No, I didn't.

1726
02:39:30,489 --> 02:39:31,959
It was more after that.

1727
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:33,639
Whatever, we'll do it.

1728
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:38,280
Louis Quipet tried to flee the country with his family and scheme with foreign

1729
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:39,559
monarchs abroad.

1730
02:39:39,559 --> 02:39:44,040
Is that not the reason for him leaving that one night in June of 1791?

1731
02:39:45,079 --> 02:39:45,559
Who knows.

1732
02:39:47,350 --> 02:39:51,670
Louis Quipet will never abandon the thoughts of suppressing the revolution by force

1733
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:53,110
before the events of 1792.

1734
02:39:53,110 --> 02:39:57,110
He gave orders for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Toulouse to be doubled.

1735
02:39:57,110 --> 02:40:00,309
He conducted a public buster in front of horrified citizens.

1736
02:40:00,309 --> 02:40:08,299
The people had no choice.

1737
02:40:08,299 --> 02:40:10,139
They had to act before Quipet attacked.

1738
02:40:10,700 --> 02:40:14,299
Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were shot at even after

1739
02:40:14,299 --> 02:40:15,979
Quipet's escape to the National Assembly.

1740
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:21,100
An order issued by the marshal, instructions issued by the minister,

1741
02:40:22,059 --> 02:40:24,780
a letter from the emperor, and a letter from the duke.

1742
02:40:25,899 --> 02:40:27,180
Let's bring it down.

1743
02:40:27,899 --> 02:40:29,559
So a letter from the duke.

1744
02:40:29,559 --> 02:40:30,680
I would call that evidence.

1745
02:40:31,239 --> 02:40:33,299
We've got a letter from the emperor.

1746
02:40:33,379 --> 02:40:34,100
What'd you call that?

1747
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:35,379
I'd call that evidence.

1748
02:40:35,379 --> 02:40:37,139
You got the minister's order.

1749
02:40:37,139 --> 02:40:39,700
I would call that, hold on, attempted escape.

1750
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:43,219
I would call that a fucking counter-revolutionary term

1751
02:40:44,329 --> 02:40:45,290
or course of events.

1752
02:40:46,309 --> 02:40:47,430
Suppressing the revolution.

1753
02:40:48,469 --> 02:40:49,430
That's your method.

1754
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:51,190
That's your method to do that.

1755
02:40:55,370 --> 02:40:56,569
That's the method.

1756
02:40:56,569 --> 02:40:57,129
It's not.

1757
02:40:57,129 --> 02:40:58,489
That's the course of actions.

1758
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:13,819
Uh-oh.

1759
02:41:13,819 --> 02:41:14,700
And that's your method.

1760
02:41:15,819 --> 02:41:17,430
Bingo!

1761
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:20,329
More questions.

1762
02:41:20,329 --> 02:41:20,729
All right.

1763
02:41:22,549 --> 02:41:25,829
Were you aware of the plans of the emperor and the duke of Brunswick?

1764
02:41:25,829 --> 02:41:26,709
Why did you not...

1765
02:41:27,909 --> 02:41:30,709
Why did you not warn the National Assembly and the army?

1766
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:35,909
You need to speak up.

1767
02:41:36,629 --> 02:41:39,979
I did not deem their threat serious.

1768
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:43,500
Treason.

1769
02:41:44,299 --> 02:41:45,260
Allow me to quote you.

1770
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:50,170
My armies await my orders.

1771
02:41:50,170 --> 02:41:52,010
Does that not sound like a serious threat?

1772
02:41:53,590 --> 02:41:55,350
Prince Charles is impetuous,

1773
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:57,510
but I never once thought he would dare attack France.

1774
02:41:58,309 --> 02:42:00,780
All right, everyone wants him dead.

1775
02:42:02,229 --> 02:42:05,270
Did the accused intend to lead the emperor's forces to France?

1776
02:42:07,559 --> 02:42:08,600
I certainly did not.

1777
02:42:09,860 --> 02:42:15,700
In his letter, the emperor was quite clear about his intentions to return order to France.

1778
02:42:16,659 --> 02:42:18,659
I do not know plans of Emperor Leopold,

1779
02:42:18,659 --> 02:42:21,860
but I do know that I would never allow anyone to spill French blood.

1780
02:42:23,030 --> 02:42:26,870
But you must admit that such an offer from an enemy government paints you in a bad light.

1781
02:42:28,459 --> 02:42:32,219
Dear God, is it merely personal correspondence from my brother-in-law?

1782
02:42:32,860 --> 02:42:38,329
It's not personal when the letters exchanged are by rulers and deal in matters of national security.

1783
02:42:40,889 --> 02:42:41,209
All right.

1784
02:42:41,209 --> 02:42:42,170
Let's calm it down a little.

1785
02:42:43,930 --> 02:42:44,409
Oh, shit.

1786
02:42:44,409 --> 02:42:45,129
They're going to riot.

1787
02:42:45,690 --> 02:42:56,500
He's going to die.

1788
02:42:58,329 --> 02:43:00,010
Did the defendant confess to the crime?

1789
02:43:00,010 --> 02:43:01,139
No.

1790
02:43:01,139 --> 02:43:04,100
Who was corrupting politicians on Citizen Cafe's request?

1791
02:43:06,659 --> 02:43:10,100
Did Citizen Cafe explain his reasoning behind Roland's mission of corruption?

1792
02:43:10,100 --> 02:43:15,540
He denies the situation took place, and I don't know who did this.

1793
02:43:18,219 --> 02:43:19,979
I think it was, was it Roland?

1794
02:43:27,350 --> 02:43:28,950
He literally just said it.

1795
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:56,870
Say a letter.

1796
02:43:56,870 --> 02:43:57,829
Look at that boost.

1797
02:43:58,950 --> 02:44:05,030
I, Sigward of Katarina, sentence Citizen Cafe to death by guillotine.

1798
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:06,149
Take the convict away.

1799
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:09,559
Long live the people.

1800
02:44:09,559 --> 02:44:10,600
Down with the tyrant.

1801
02:44:12,739 --> 02:44:17,399
Oh, damn.

1802
02:44:17,399 --> 02:44:23,479
Good job.

1803
02:44:23,479 --> 02:44:24,920
Got some extra influence points.

1804
02:44:27,180 --> 02:44:27,819
He's ours.

1805
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:31,909
Okay, let's go watch.

1806
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:37,299
No one's upset with me.

1807
02:44:37,299 --> 02:44:39,780
Yeah, but everybody wanted it.

1808
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:46,549
Understand?

1809
02:44:49,959 --> 02:44:54,360
Their excitement was stronger than the smell of the fresh wood the guillotine was made from.

1810
02:44:55,079 --> 02:44:58,739
Know what's about to happen?

1811
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:03,219
Turbo vs. Star.

1812
02:45:03,219 --> 02:45:06,579
Sheep that only now realize they used to have fangs and claws.

1813
02:45:07,059 --> 02:45:07,559
Oh.

1814
02:45:34,540 --> 02:45:39,180
The guy in the bottom right is every created character that allows me that haircut

1815
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:41,739
has that haircut for every game I play with the creative character.

1816
02:45:43,719 --> 02:45:46,120
I was unable to understand their screams.

1817
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:49,319
I only tasted the stench of their sweaty bodies.

1818
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:53,299
But I could hear one thing perfectly.

1819
02:45:54,100 --> 02:45:57,930
Bring us the king.

1820
02:46:02,379 --> 02:46:03,100
Time for a speech.

1821
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:05,079
This one's important.

1822
02:46:08,739 --> 02:46:13,959
All right, so we have oversensitive, crime, revolution.

1823
02:46:13,959 --> 02:46:14,600
I have points.

1824
02:46:16,579 --> 02:46:17,700
So they've withdrawn.

1825
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:25,000
They're oversensitive about the king,

1826
02:46:26,489 --> 02:46:28,010
which means we could do humility here.

1827
02:46:33,399 --> 02:46:34,040
Revolution.

1828
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:35,639
Manipulation.

1829
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:38,549
Full aggro.

1830
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:47,770
I'm not going to do full aggro.

1831
02:46:48,649 --> 02:46:52,489
Humility is better for withdrawn, I think.

1832
02:46:53,209 --> 02:46:54,489
Why would you use carelessness?

1833
02:46:55,129 --> 02:47:04,469
And then oversensitive.

1834
02:47:04,469 --> 02:47:10,409
That's, yeah, I mean, that's either manipulation.

1835
02:47:10,409 --> 02:47:11,370
Aye, yai, yai.

1836
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:15,209
All right, well, defendant is manipulation is perfect.

1837
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:17,530
So withdrawn, is it all?

1838
02:47:19,590 --> 02:47:22,889
Nobody wants to be shouted at when they're withdrawn.

1839
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:25,579
Maybe carelessness.

1840
02:47:31,059 --> 02:47:34,180
Maybe aggressive for the crime, but not aggressive for revolution.

1841
02:47:34,180 --> 02:47:35,059
Maybe, I don't know.

1842
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:37,700
I would say manipulation for revolution.

1843
02:47:43,290 --> 02:47:45,209
Crime aggressive might work here.

1844
02:47:45,209 --> 02:47:49,659
Aggressive manipulation and then, I don't know.

1845
02:47:50,379 --> 02:47:52,659
Let's try aggressive here.

1846
02:47:53,299 --> 02:47:58,100
Disorder shall be suppressed with the brutal strength of our truth.

1847
02:47:58,100 --> 02:47:59,299
No turning back now.

1848
02:47:59,940 --> 02:48:00,659
All right, that was good.

1849
02:48:01,219 --> 02:48:03,129
And then manipulation for the defendant.

1850
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:07,719
These offenders want to go back to the old ways they defend them.

1851
02:48:08,280 --> 02:48:08,920
Intrigued.

1852
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:11,799
And then revolution.

1853
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:13,879
Let's go with manipulation again.

1854
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:19,479
Aggression.

1855
02:48:23,219 --> 02:48:26,579
These criminals think that because we are tolerant, we are so weak that is not enough.

1856
02:48:28,100 --> 02:48:37,909
Speaking of not enough, who comes?

1857
02:48:37,909 --> 02:48:39,590
I die as an innocent man.

1858
02:48:39,590 --> 02:48:41,110
I forgive my enemies.

1859
02:48:41,829 --> 02:48:52,120
For the revolution.

1860
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:55,079
All the road.

1861
02:48:55,079 --> 02:49:06,459
Do they ever clean this thing?

1862
02:49:07,590 --> 02:49:08,309
Somebody probably does.

1863
02:49:08,309 --> 02:49:09,110
Maybe like once a week.

1864
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:13,379
I must be dreaming.

1865
02:49:13,379 --> 02:49:15,780
Is that the map from the Muggler's case?

1866
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:17,700
You stole evidence from the court?

1867
02:49:18,340 --> 02:49:20,059
I did not steal it.

1868
02:49:20,620 --> 02:49:22,219
Only found a use for it.

1869
02:49:22,219 --> 02:49:26,459
It will be more useful in your room than in the dusty drawers of the court archives.

1870
02:49:27,260 --> 02:49:32,219
After all, this is a map by Turgo and should be traded with respect.

1871
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:34,840
What a lovely explanation.

1872
02:49:35,399 --> 02:49:36,790
Consider it a gift.

1873
02:49:37,350 --> 02:49:38,149
Take it.

1874
02:49:38,149 --> 02:49:39,590
And try not to talk so much.

1875
02:49:40,229 --> 02:49:42,549
You should be more concerned about the events with the king.

1876
02:49:43,270 --> 02:49:45,510
Because this whole situation just seems pretty.

1877
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:50,680
As your superior, I should be the one judging your ways and case.

1878
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:57,180
I failed to understand why Rumpus Spear asked for your assistance.

1879
02:49:57,180 --> 02:49:58,059
Wait, are you jealous?

1880
02:49:59,209 --> 02:50:00,329
Of course I'm jealous.

1881
02:50:01,270 --> 02:50:07,219
It is an important moment in history and people will be reading about it.

1882
02:50:07,219 --> 02:50:07,940
People hate this.

1883
02:50:08,579 --> 02:50:09,700
It seems there will be trouble.

1884
02:50:09,700 --> 02:50:11,700
I have a feeling that someone is toying with my life

1885
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:14,100
as though an unknown force were pushing me into utter chaos.

1886
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:17,620
Keep your eyes open.

1887
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:21,700
You came to the political world of this city from out of nowhere.

1888
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:24,260
And that means someone will have to step down to make room.

1889
02:50:26,520 --> 02:50:28,600
Do you have to sound so defeated?

1890
02:50:28,600 --> 02:50:30,520
My husband is a renowned person now.

1891
02:50:30,520 --> 02:50:33,780
We should be happy about it.

1892
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:35,940
It is easier to shoot someone in the spotlight.

1893
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:43,159
Evening stroll.

1894
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:50,180
Whoa, we just unlocked one.

1895
02:50:50,180 --> 02:50:52,680
Demonstration.

1896
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:55,690
Let them see real life up close.

1897
02:50:55,690 --> 02:50:56,329
No, no, no, no.

1898
02:50:56,329 --> 02:50:58,139
We gotta chill out here.

1899
02:50:58,139 --> 02:50:59,020
Evening stroll.

1900
02:50:59,020 --> 02:51:01,399
No, hates that.

1901
02:51:01,399 --> 02:51:02,200
Political debate.

1902
02:51:02,200 --> 02:51:03,399
He hates that too.

1903
02:51:03,399 --> 02:51:04,520
Paragraphs and codes.

1904
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:12,899
Take a walk with dad.

1905
02:51:21,659 --> 02:51:22,860
Let's go to demonstration.

1906
02:51:22,860 --> 02:51:23,979
Let's go see it.

1907
02:51:23,979 --> 02:51:28,790
Let's go.

1908
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:32,920
Full bar.

1909
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:42,040
Full bar.

1910
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:43,079
Alt is ready.

1911
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:54,440
The people have shrugged the invisible burden off their backs.

1912
02:51:55,159 --> 02:51:56,760
The streets seem more peaceful.

1913
02:51:57,559 --> 02:52:00,280
Even the windows at the courthouse were soon replaced.

1914
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,780
That's the whole day?

1915
02:52:03,860 --> 02:52:04,340
Oh, okay.

1916
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,780
Oh, look at all these points.

1917
02:52:09,579 --> 02:52:12,950
Dear Citizen Fidel, I am writing to congratulate you

1918
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:15,030
on becoming a part of our country's history.

1919
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:17,430
Citizen Cafe's trial is on everyone's lips.

1920
02:52:17,430 --> 02:52:19,590
I would also like to discuss the important topic

1921
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:21,350
of appointing the new commander-in-chief

1922
02:52:21,350 --> 02:52:24,709
of the National Guard who will replace Citizen Burel.

1923
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:28,309
It is my honest belief that I am the best candidate.

1924
02:52:28,950 --> 02:52:30,549
So would you give me your permission?

1925
02:52:30,549 --> 02:52:32,549
I would like to pay you a visit this evening.

1926
02:52:32,549 --> 02:52:34,069
Long live the Republic.

1927
02:52:34,069 --> 02:52:35,750
Francois Henriot.

1928
02:52:39,829 --> 02:52:40,229
All right.

1929
02:52:40,229 --> 02:52:44,149
So we have burglary, assault, theft, destruction of property.

1930
02:52:48,299 --> 02:52:52,219
And we have people, revolutionaries want prison.

1931
02:52:52,860 --> 02:52:53,979
Common folk want acquittal.

1932
02:52:56,219 --> 02:52:56,940
All right.

1933
02:52:56,940 --> 02:52:57,979
Let's take a look at the case.

1934
02:52:59,770 --> 02:53:00,329
One of the two.

1935
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:03,879
But first of all, Juno.

1936
02:53:05,079 --> 02:53:06,520
Juno Obsetto.

1937
02:53:06,520 --> 02:53:08,360
Juno Obsetto, thanks for the five community subs.

1938
02:53:09,899 --> 02:53:10,940
Five subs.

1939
02:53:11,659 --> 02:53:13,659
Just rifling in right now.

1940
02:53:13,659 --> 02:53:13,979
Thank you.

1941
02:53:14,620 --> 02:53:18,010
Really appreciate that.

1942
02:53:18,010 --> 02:53:23,420
That was Juno Obsetto.

1943
02:53:26,579 --> 02:53:31,379
So we have, before the court stands, Claude Garnier,

1944
02:53:31,940 --> 02:53:35,780
a resident of Paris and a baker's apprentice, arrested for robbery.

1945
02:53:35,780 --> 02:53:38,100
He led a group of people who broke into the house

1946
02:53:38,100 --> 02:53:41,139
of citizen Dominique Fournier, a wealthy man.

1947
02:53:41,860 --> 02:53:44,899
According to Fournier's testimony, the robbers insulted him

1948
02:53:44,899 --> 02:53:46,899
and then began beating him.

1949
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:49,610
All right.

1950
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:52,889
At the same time, Claude told his accomplices,

1951
02:53:53,370 --> 02:53:55,049
which expensive belonging should be taken,

1952
02:53:55,049 --> 02:53:58,409
and the group left the battered Fournier lying on the floor.

1953
02:53:59,129 --> 02:54:01,129
Many witnesses saw the whole incident.

1954
02:54:01,129 --> 02:54:03,930
Fournier's servants saw present during the events,

1955
02:54:04,649 --> 02:54:06,649
while some passers-by looked through the windows.

1956
02:54:11,059 --> 02:54:13,540
Garnier not only admitted to leading the group,

1957
02:54:13,540 --> 02:54:15,139
but he actually boasted about it,

1958
02:54:15,139 --> 02:54:17,860
calling it a revolutionary deed of which he was proud.

1959
02:54:18,500 --> 02:54:21,860
He supposedly found out that Fournier is funding

1960
02:54:21,860 --> 02:54:23,299
counterrevolutionary leaflets

1961
02:54:23,299 --> 02:54:25,379
and decided to relieve him of his funds.

1962
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:30,139
The accused would not reveal the source of the information.

1963
02:54:30,139 --> 02:54:33,819
He handed the guards a lampoon of Robespierre,

1964
02:54:34,379 --> 02:54:36,379
claiming that he had found a thick pile of them

1965
02:54:36,379 --> 02:54:37,180
in the victim's house.

1966
02:54:38,149 --> 02:54:42,309
Garnier claimed to having burned all but one,

1967
02:54:42,309 --> 02:54:43,670
which he kept as evidence.

1968
02:54:44,309 --> 02:54:45,590
When the guards arrested him,

1969
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:48,709
they noticed a gold signet ring on his finger

1970
02:54:48,709 --> 02:54:50,469
that belonged to Fournier.

1971
02:54:51,350 --> 02:54:52,549
Okay.

1972
02:54:52,549 --> 02:54:55,909
Garnier often takes a stand during the gatherings of the Engrage,

1973
02:54:56,469 --> 02:54:59,030
demanding that all wealthy people be hanged.

1974
02:54:59,989 --> 02:55:03,270
In the year 1789, he took part in the storming of the Bastille.

1975
02:55:07,290 --> 02:55:10,520
So let's go.

1976
02:55:11,079 --> 02:55:13,719
So we have the...

1977
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:18,780
There's a trap here, though.

1978
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:21,639
Assaulting the victim is...

1979
02:55:24,040 --> 02:55:24,840
Who is the witness here?

1980
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:25,239
We have...

1981
02:55:25,879 --> 02:55:27,750
There's one of the servants.

1982
02:55:27,750 --> 02:55:28,709
One of the servants was a witness.

1983
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:30,069
So that's one.

1984
02:55:30,870 --> 02:55:37,780
Freeing the Bastille prisoners.

1985
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:38,340
That's a...

1986
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:45,959
The gold signet is evidence.

1987
02:55:49,739 --> 02:55:50,780
I'm afraid of a trap here.

1988
02:55:50,780 --> 02:55:54,709
Break-in is the accusation, right?

1989
02:55:54,709 --> 02:56:00,950
I mean, I want to see what's going on.

1990
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:02,940
He led a group of people

1991
02:56:03,579 --> 02:56:06,500
broke into the house of Dominique Fournier,

1992
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:07,139
a wealthy man.

1993
02:56:10,489 --> 02:56:11,049
God.

1994
02:56:11,049 --> 02:56:12,569
According to Fournier's testimony...

1995
02:56:13,209 --> 02:56:13,530
All right.

1996
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:23,479
So break-in is the accusation.

1997
02:56:24,040 --> 02:56:27,989
Assaulting the victim is an accusation.

1998
02:56:28,549 --> 02:56:31,750
I feel like the funding thing is a trap.

1999
02:56:36,409 --> 02:56:37,370
Funding leaflets...

2000
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:48,409
No.

2001
02:56:48,409 --> 02:56:48,729
Shit.

2002
02:56:49,290 --> 02:56:57,350
We need more people like Gagné.

2003
02:56:57,350 --> 02:57:00,620
Please introduce yourself.

2004
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:02,540
My name is Claude Gagné.

2005
02:57:02,540 --> 02:57:05,260
You are accused of breaking into the house of Citizen Fournier,

2006
02:57:05,260 --> 02:57:07,579
whom you then brutally assaulted and robbed.

2007
02:57:08,219 --> 02:57:10,440
I led an investigation of his house.

2008
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:11,479
Viva la révolution.

2009
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:12,760
Good.

2010
02:57:16,069 --> 02:57:17,030
Is that what you're gonna yell?

2011
02:57:18,489 --> 02:57:19,770
That's the reaction somebody has

2012
02:57:19,770 --> 02:57:21,530
when they've been paying attention to their iPhone.

2013
02:57:21,930 --> 02:57:23,209
And are asked for a comment.

2014
02:57:25,559 --> 02:57:26,040
Good.

2015
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:26,360
Yeah.

2016
02:57:27,370 --> 02:57:30,170
Who gave you the right to represent the revolution?

2017
02:57:30,809 --> 02:57:32,149
The people of Paris.

2018
02:57:33,180 --> 02:57:33,899
Sure we did.

2019
02:57:34,540 --> 02:57:36,069
Is that sarcastic or...

2020
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:41,659
It's motive.

2021
02:57:41,659 --> 02:57:44,139
Fine.

2022
02:57:44,139 --> 02:57:44,459
No.

2023
02:57:44,459 --> 02:57:45,979
One of these is a trap.

2024
02:57:49,670 --> 02:57:50,389
Fine answer.

2025
02:57:51,030 --> 02:57:52,069
There's the trap.

2026
02:57:52,069 --> 02:57:52,790
There's the trap.

2027
02:57:54,790 --> 02:57:58,090
That's okay.

2028
02:58:00,709 --> 02:58:01,510
All right.

2029
02:58:01,510 --> 02:58:03,590
So he was beaten.

2030
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:04,790
Why was he severely beaten?

2031
02:58:05,350 --> 02:58:07,319
He could have avoided it, yes.

2032
02:58:07,319 --> 02:58:08,520
I punched him once or twice.

2033
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,079
Only because he kept squealing like a pig.

2034
02:58:11,639 --> 02:58:13,559
Are you proud of yourself?

2035
02:58:13,559 --> 02:58:14,600
He got what he deserved.

2036
02:58:15,559 --> 02:58:17,079
Royalists are animals.

2037
02:58:17,719 --> 02:58:21,450
He kept squealing when you were turning his place over.

2038
02:58:22,010 --> 02:58:24,969
He was plotting against decent Parisians.

2039
02:58:24,969 --> 02:58:25,690
Isn't that enough?

2040
02:58:26,489 --> 02:58:27,770
We'll kill that dog.

2041
02:58:29,959 --> 02:58:30,280
Okay.

2042
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:36,620
Would you like...

2043
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:37,100
Would you...

2044
02:58:37,659 --> 02:58:39,659
Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with...

2045
02:58:39,659 --> 02:58:41,180
You were found with a gold signet.

2046
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:41,420
Yeah.

2047
02:58:42,139 --> 02:58:45,459
I have reason to believe that it belonged to the victim.

2048
02:58:45,459 --> 02:58:45,940
Am I right?

2049
02:58:47,079 --> 02:58:49,159
Why do you keep calling him a victim?

2050
02:58:49,159 --> 02:58:50,760
He's a rich traitor.

2051
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:52,440
The true victims of the people of France.

2052
02:58:54,250 --> 02:58:55,690
You know what we're talking about.

2053
02:58:55,690 --> 02:58:57,850
And we will take care of him in due course.

2054
02:58:57,850 --> 02:58:59,290
Now what about that signet?

2055
02:59:00,180 --> 02:59:00,659
Oh, yeah.

2056
02:59:00,659 --> 02:59:01,459
The signet.

2057
02:59:01,459 --> 02:59:02,180
Nice, isn't it?

2058
02:59:02,739 --> 02:59:05,540
Those swines got fat off our hard work.

2059
02:59:05,540 --> 02:59:07,780
And they refused to give us a tiny part of their wealth.

2060
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:08,819
Not even the tiniest.

2061
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:10,200
Huzzah!

2062
02:59:10,819 --> 02:59:13,079
What did you plan to do with it?

2063
02:59:13,959 --> 02:59:14,360
Nothing.

2064
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:15,559
Looked nice on my finger.

2065
02:59:15,559 --> 02:59:16,680
Much better than on that pig.

2066
02:59:17,319 --> 02:59:20,069
The signet was not only the thing you took.

2067
02:59:21,219 --> 02:59:22,180
It wasn't the only thing.

2068
02:59:22,819 --> 02:59:23,379
Was it?

2069
02:59:23,379 --> 02:59:25,459
I heard the house was stripped of everything precious.

2070
02:59:26,420 --> 02:59:28,979
I was especially fond of those gold-plated candlesticks.

2071
02:59:33,260 --> 02:59:33,659
All right.

2072
02:59:33,659 --> 02:59:33,899
Well.

2073
02:59:36,120 --> 02:59:38,120
Why would you think that the victim had anything to do

2074
02:59:39,879 --> 02:59:41,719
with the counter-revolutionary activity?

2075
02:59:42,809 --> 02:59:43,930
Ask anyone on the street.

2076
02:59:43,930 --> 02:59:45,290
They all knew about it.

2077
02:59:45,290 --> 02:59:47,610
Only no one had any proof and we were tired of waiting.

2078
02:59:48,420 --> 02:59:49,379
How did they know?

2079
02:59:49,379 --> 02:59:50,739
Did the rats talk to them?

2080
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:52,579
Well, I just knew.

2081
02:59:52,579 --> 02:59:55,610
People always know what's going on.

2082
02:59:55,610 --> 02:59:57,850
We always smell a filthy royalist.

2083
02:59:58,569 --> 03:00:01,590
So you decided to find evidence of Fournier's guilt.

2084
03:00:02,819 --> 03:00:05,860
Whenever someone's suspected of a crime, there's an investigation.

2085
03:00:05,860 --> 03:00:06,899
No.

2086
03:00:06,899 --> 03:00:08,020
We decided to do one.

2087
03:00:08,579 --> 03:00:10,059
Do I understand correctly?

2088
03:00:10,059 --> 03:00:11,340
Let me just make sure I understand.

2089
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:12,540
Do I get this?

2090
03:00:12,540 --> 03:00:15,180
You assaulted Citizen Fournier because of some rumors.

2091
03:00:15,180 --> 03:00:16,139
Am I getting that?

2092
03:00:16,139 --> 03:00:16,860
Do I get that correctly?

2093
03:00:18,360 --> 03:00:21,159
Mr. Judge, are you implying that Parisians are liars?

2094
03:00:22,920 --> 03:00:24,840
I'm the one who asked the questions here.

2095
03:00:24,920 --> 03:00:25,399
Not you.

2096
03:00:26,500 --> 03:00:28,579
The judge is on the side of the bourgeoisie.

2097
03:00:29,530 --> 03:00:32,280
Uh-oh.

2098
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:34,360
That was a family guy to your joke.

2099
03:00:50,940 --> 03:00:51,979
Oh, give me a break.

2100
03:00:52,780 --> 03:00:53,180
Whatever.

2101
03:00:58,620 --> 03:01:00,870
Let's get the witness in here.

2102
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:03,670
The victim's servant, Gaten Cave.

2103
03:01:09,700 --> 03:01:12,020
Why did you not try to interrupt or defend the victim?

2104
03:01:13,780 --> 03:01:14,739
Why didn't you do that?

2105
03:01:16,489 --> 03:01:16,989
Me?

2106
03:01:17,860 --> 03:01:18,360
Yes.

2107
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:21,309
I only said why.

2108
03:01:21,309 --> 03:01:23,549
What chance would I have against a group of thugs?

2109
03:01:28,729 --> 03:01:30,090
Did they attack you as well?

2110
03:01:31,629 --> 03:01:33,149
Fortunately, they didn't.

2111
03:01:36,270 --> 03:01:39,469
It is clear that their aim was the bourgeoisie and not the common people.

2112
03:01:39,469 --> 03:01:40,430
Did you call for help?

2113
03:01:41,709 --> 03:01:44,030
I yelled, but nobody came.

2114
03:01:49,049 --> 03:01:49,850
I yelled.

2115
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,200
I yelled.

2116
03:01:56,200 --> 03:01:59,420
Why didn't you call the police with the phones that don't exist?

2117
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:01,500
They screamed out the window like they used to do.

2118
03:02:01,500 --> 03:02:02,000
All right.

2119
03:02:02,559 --> 03:02:09,469
After you were arrested, you handed the guards a slanderous leaflet about citizen Robb's Pier.

2120
03:02:10,110 --> 03:02:13,649
I found it in the royalist's pig's house.

2121
03:02:13,649 --> 03:02:16,370
There were scores of them there, and we burned them all in the street.

2122
03:02:17,739 --> 03:02:18,239
Wonderful.

2123
03:02:19,309 --> 03:02:20,989
You did not burn that one.

2124
03:02:21,549 --> 03:02:23,899
I saved it just in case, you know, I needed it for something.

2125
03:02:24,829 --> 03:02:26,989
How can we be sure it belonged to Faunier?

2126
03:02:27,549 --> 03:02:29,180
Where else would I have found it?

2127
03:02:29,739 --> 03:02:32,290
Tell us exactly where you found it.

2128
03:02:32,850 --> 03:02:36,350
He had piles of these leaflets in a recess there.

2129
03:02:37,819 --> 03:02:38,319
Plotter!

2130
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:39,520
Scum!

2131
03:02:41,020 --> 03:02:43,659
Why did you not go to the guard with the leaflet at once?

2132
03:02:45,170 --> 03:02:45,729
Why would I?

2133
03:02:46,610 --> 03:02:49,729
With evidence like that, you could be sure the accused would meet the guillotine.

2134
03:02:53,139 --> 03:02:54,020
He's right.

2135
03:02:54,020 --> 03:02:55,860
You should have brought the leaflet to the guard.

2136
03:02:56,340 --> 03:03:02,350
They're on my side now.

2137
03:03:02,350 --> 03:03:05,739
Did you really take part in the storming of the Bastille?

2138
03:03:05,739 --> 03:03:06,239
I did.

2139
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:08,379
What a hero, one of us.

2140
03:03:11,540 --> 03:03:12,829
There's just chat back there.

2141
03:03:12,829 --> 03:03:13,329
It really is.

2142
03:03:14,030 --> 03:03:15,469
Was your experience helpful?

2143
03:03:15,469 --> 03:03:18,430
The only thing missing was Delaunay's head raised on a pike.

2144
03:03:19,069 --> 03:03:21,360
That's another difference.

2145
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:22,799
I wasn't arrested for doing it.

2146
03:03:22,799 --> 03:03:24,719
Everyone knew what they were doing, the right thing.

2147
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:26,959
The Bastille was a fortress.

2148
03:03:26,959 --> 03:03:29,600
We are talking about breaking into the house of an unarmed man

2149
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:30,959
and that is why we have doubts.

2150
03:03:32,989 --> 03:03:35,149
You mean an unarmed, royalist pig?

2151
03:03:38,049 --> 03:03:38,549
All right.

2152
03:03:39,010 --> 03:03:41,040
Common folk want acquittal.

2153
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:43,200
Revolutionaries want prison.

2154
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:47,280
Why meet you?

2155
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:48,559
Did they confess to the crimes?

2156
03:03:48,559 --> 03:03:49,059
Yeah.

2157
03:03:50,030 --> 03:03:51,549
Common revolutionary in nature?

2158
03:03:53,069 --> 03:03:53,569
No.

2159
03:03:53,870 --> 03:03:55,950
What made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people?

2160
03:03:56,590 --> 03:03:58,540
He took part in the storming of the Bastille.

2161
03:04:03,309 --> 03:04:04,110
Kill him is a joke.

2162
03:04:08,129 --> 03:04:09,010
I'm not going to kill him.

2163
03:04:09,569 --> 03:04:12,049
I'm going to put him in prison.

2164
03:04:12,049 --> 03:04:22,940
Nobody wants that.

2165
03:04:22,940 --> 03:04:23,440
Prison.

2166
03:04:23,979 --> 03:04:24,479
Acquittal.

2167
03:04:25,420 --> 03:04:25,899
Wait a minute.

2168
03:04:25,899 --> 03:04:26,399
Hold on.

2169
03:04:27,440 --> 03:04:28,559
Reputation bonus.

2170
03:04:32,450 --> 03:04:35,170
No, let's keep it normal here.

2171
03:04:35,170 --> 03:04:35,670
Prison.

2172
03:04:36,209 --> 03:04:37,010
Sentence to prison.

2173
03:04:37,569 --> 03:04:41,809
That'll be balanced.

2174
03:04:44,180 --> 03:04:44,659
I quit.

2175
03:04:44,659 --> 03:04:45,159
I quit.

2176
03:04:46,180 --> 03:04:46,680
No.

2177
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,440
I want to keep this balanced.

2178
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:52,079
I'm a judge.

2179
03:04:52,799 --> 03:04:57,899
I'm a judge.

2180
03:04:58,620 --> 03:05:01,360
I don't acquit somebody

2181
03:05:01,360 --> 03:05:03,040
because somebody in Twitch chat yelled at me

2182
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:04,479
to like turn around and pick up the item.

2183
03:05:04,479 --> 03:05:05,440
Actually, I do that all the time.

2184
03:05:09,299 --> 03:05:11,459
We've changed entire game sessions

2185
03:05:11,459 --> 03:05:13,620
based on what like three people have said in chat before.

2186
03:05:13,620 --> 03:05:18,819
So I sentence Citizen Glaude Garnier to prison.

2187
03:05:19,540 --> 03:05:20,819
Lead the condemned out.

2188
03:05:21,870 --> 03:05:22,370
What?

2189
03:05:24,690 --> 03:05:26,049
Check, check, check.

2190
03:05:26,049 --> 03:05:26,549
Good job.

2191
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:28,979
Reputation and influence.

2192
03:05:34,780 --> 03:05:35,280
What?

2193
03:05:35,739 --> 03:05:39,250
Good work.

2194
03:05:39,969 --> 03:05:43,379
So I notice when I like beat that guy up

2195
03:05:43,379 --> 03:05:44,659
and like sent thugs to his house,

2196
03:05:44,659 --> 03:05:45,780
no one's done anything since.

2197
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:50,239
Hold on.

2198
03:05:50,239 --> 03:06:08,979
Okay.

2199
03:06:08,979 --> 03:06:10,420
That was a big juicy one.

2200
03:06:10,420 --> 03:06:13,360
I can feel that one down here.

2201
03:06:13,360 --> 03:06:18,860
Oh, I wasn't muted.

2202
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:20,379
I went to be muted when I said that.

2203
03:06:20,379 --> 03:06:20,780
Fuck.

2204
03:06:20,780 --> 03:06:22,139
It caught embarrassing.

2205
03:06:22,139 --> 03:06:22,639
What?

2206
03:06:23,180 --> 03:06:24,219
Like a hot mic.

2207
03:06:24,940 --> 03:06:29,149
Your wife told me that I seek the support of just people.

2208
03:06:29,149 --> 03:06:32,899
I should look for them in your house.

2209
03:06:32,899 --> 03:06:34,180
Yes, Citizen Hanria.

2210
03:06:34,180 --> 03:06:35,540
My husband will be more than happy

2211
03:06:35,540 --> 03:06:39,379
to endorse your candidacy for the post of commander in Captain Crunch.

2212
03:06:40,850 --> 03:06:43,489
Why does this feel like a fait accompli?

2213
03:06:44,129 --> 03:06:48,590
Please do not be angry at your wife.

2214
03:06:48,590 --> 03:06:51,629
I am sure that they acted in good faith when she made those promises.

2215
03:06:51,629 --> 03:06:55,860
How could anyone refuse to support such a respectable officer?

2216
03:06:56,420 --> 03:06:59,860
I'm certain that my husband will acknowledge your merits just as I have.

2217
03:07:01,870 --> 03:07:03,069
Undoubtedly.

2218
03:07:03,069 --> 03:07:05,950
But how can I be so sure when there are so many other candidates?

2219
03:07:07,569 --> 03:07:09,010
Well, I respect the other candidates.

2220
03:07:09,010 --> 03:07:10,049
They are decent people.

2221
03:07:10,049 --> 03:07:12,450
However, I can offer you the most precious gift.

2222
03:07:13,329 --> 03:07:13,729
Money.

2223
03:07:14,290 --> 03:07:16,290
Working together, we can greatly benefit each other

2224
03:07:16,290 --> 03:07:20,750
and maybe Barry too.

2225
03:07:20,750 --> 03:07:24,510
Our family has a high regard for sincerity and loyalty, does it not, my dear?

2226
03:07:24,510 --> 03:07:28,620
Moreover, we respect each other's boundaries.

2227
03:07:28,620 --> 03:07:29,340
At every turn.

2228
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:35,680
Yes, sir, those ugly rumours about you being an addict should be put to an end.

2229
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:40,260
Nor that I never forget those who have done me a favour.

2230
03:07:40,260 --> 03:07:41,940
Words, words, words.

2231
03:07:41,940 --> 03:07:44,879
A lot of words, Citizen Hanria.

2232
03:07:44,879 --> 03:07:48,159
I am certain that no other candidate has asked for your endorsement.

2233
03:07:48,159 --> 03:07:50,899
They do not think that you are worthy of their friendship.

2234
03:07:50,899 --> 03:07:54,100
But I, Francois Henry, am different.

2235
03:07:54,100 --> 03:07:55,780
And so are my words.

2236
03:07:56,420 --> 03:07:59,889
I am sure that my husband has already noticed that.

2237
03:08:00,819 --> 03:08:02,399
Thank you.

2238
03:08:02,399 --> 03:08:04,159
Regardless of what the masses are yelling,

2239
03:08:04,159 --> 03:08:06,959
Paris is only as strong as its united elites.

2240
03:08:06,959 --> 03:08:09,819
I will not retract my wife's promises.

2241
03:08:09,819 --> 03:08:12,540
But in the future, make sure you come to me first.

2242
03:08:12,540 --> 03:08:13,549
But of course.

2243
03:08:17,629 --> 03:08:19,229
Words, words, words.

2244
03:08:24,079 --> 03:08:25,440
Okay, I need to hang out.

2245
03:08:26,479 --> 03:08:27,200
Okay.

2246
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:29,459
But now I need to learn how to deal with stage fright

2247
03:08:29,459 --> 03:08:30,819
if he wants to be a professional musician.

2248
03:08:30,819 --> 03:08:36,370
You will have to endure an hour of racket.

2249
03:08:36,370 --> 03:08:37,809
Opening night at the theatre sounds fun.

2250
03:08:38,370 --> 03:08:50,979
But the wife is happy though, right?

2251
03:08:50,979 --> 03:08:51,219
Yes.

2252
03:08:56,260 --> 03:08:57,139
You don't like that?

2253
03:08:57,139 --> 03:08:58,500
I thought you wanted to be a musician.

2254
03:09:00,479 --> 03:09:04,719
Oh, is that like me?

2255
03:09:04,719 --> 03:09:05,520
Is that yours?

2256
03:09:05,520 --> 03:09:06,319
Is that my head?

2257
03:09:06,959 --> 03:09:10,799
Decapitation still had not lost its charm since the beginning of the revolution.

2258
03:09:10,799 --> 03:09:14,959
A group of people were gathered in a Parisian street surrounding something on the floor.

2259
03:09:14,959 --> 03:09:18,399
Your prestigious position allowed you to make your way to the centre of the mob,

2260
03:09:18,399 --> 03:09:20,639
only to find a man's severed head.

2261
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:24,639
What had caught everyone's attention was that the head's facial expression,

2262
03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:26,159
it was grinning.

2263
03:09:26,799 --> 03:09:31,360
It was so unusual that the crowd stared hypnotized for no apparent reason.

2264
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:34,399
You wonder if anyone had thought to ask about the rest of the corpse.

2265
03:09:34,399 --> 03:09:37,360
A lone severed head should deftly cause curiosity,

2266
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:40,159
even if for purely scientific reasons.

2267
03:09:40,159 --> 03:09:42,719
And now you're staring alongside everybody else.

2268
03:09:45,629 --> 03:09:46,829
Order the guard to get rid of the head.

2269
03:09:47,629 --> 03:09:49,729
Leave scratching your own head.

2270
03:09:49,729 --> 03:09:55,569
No, get that fucking thing out of here.

2271
03:09:57,200 --> 03:10:01,700
Come on, the smiling head was removed and people dispersed.

2272
03:10:01,700 --> 03:10:02,340
That's Paris.

2273
03:10:03,870 --> 03:10:07,149
Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely fucking ridiculous.

2274
03:10:07,149 --> 03:10:08,190
I don't want that on the street.

2275
03:10:13,069 --> 03:10:14,110
I'm gonna get booed for that.

2276
03:10:19,149 --> 03:10:20,670
A paris of a new era.

2277
03:10:25,340 --> 03:10:27,260
Weak, vulnerable to attacks.

2278
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:33,020
Waiting for someone to reach for power.

2279
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:41,459
Waiting for someone who, once again, will take control of its soul.

2280
03:10:44,399 --> 03:10:46,000
The pawns are now in play.

2281
03:10:46,559 --> 03:10:49,180
It's just like Los Santos down here.

2282
03:10:50,819 --> 03:10:52,879
Revolutionary holiday.

2283
03:10:52,879 --> 03:10:54,959
Recent days have proven that Paris can win,

2284
03:10:54,959 --> 03:10:56,000
that France can win.

2285
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,520
We managed to overcome our past,

2286
03:10:58,079 --> 03:11:01,360
divesting our last remaining tyrant office power.

2287
03:11:01,360 --> 03:11:03,860
Now it's time to rebuild.

2288
03:11:04,719 --> 03:11:07,200
To create symbols that inspire future generations.

2289
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:08,959
That is why during a gathering at the convention,

2290
03:11:08,959 --> 03:11:13,280
several enterprising citizens proposed the construction of a statue

2291
03:11:13,280 --> 03:11:15,840
to commemorate the revolutionary victory over injustice.

2292
03:11:16,559 --> 03:11:18,979
You were given the honor of supervising the construction.

2293
03:11:19,540 --> 03:11:23,379
There is no better candidate than the one who vanquished Louis Capet.

2294
03:11:23,379 --> 03:11:25,860
You have an opportunity to leave yet another mark on Paris.

2295
03:11:25,860 --> 03:11:27,700
Do I get to say what it looks like?

2296
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:33,059
Can you not speak these common words?

2297
03:11:34,899 --> 03:11:36,659
I'm trying not to cough in the middle of them.

2298
03:11:39,620 --> 03:11:40,260
Like I just did.

2299
03:11:40,979 --> 03:11:44,100
Each section can be controlled by you, by an enemy, or by a neutral.

2300
03:11:44,659 --> 03:11:47,540
They're opening up a game, a board game now?

2301
03:11:51,889 --> 03:11:52,290
All right.

2302
03:11:53,360 --> 03:11:56,959
Each section you take over provides you with one additional influence point.

2303
03:11:56,959 --> 03:11:59,760
The chance of mission success is higher in your territory.

2304
03:12:02,270 --> 03:12:04,829
Enemy agents can also take over your sections.

2305
03:12:05,629 --> 03:12:08,750
Actions performed in enemy sections are less likely to be successful.

2306
03:12:10,239 --> 03:12:11,520
Some sections are locked.

2307
03:12:11,520 --> 03:12:14,239
I'll lock them with any agent to carry out actions without them.

2308
03:12:14,879 --> 03:12:17,920
To unlock a section, you have to scout it first.

2309
03:12:18,559 --> 03:12:20,399
You can only unlock sections adjacent to the ones

2310
03:12:20,399 --> 03:12:22,479
that you already have unlocked.

2311
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:28,000
A fervor.

2312
03:12:28,559 --> 03:12:31,360
Each section reacts to the situation in the game,

2313
03:12:32,299 --> 03:12:35,100
causing the fervor of residents to rise or fall.

2314
03:12:35,100 --> 03:12:38,059
If the fervor becomes too intense, it could result in destructive riots.

2315
03:12:40,020 --> 03:12:40,420
Geez.

2316
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:42,799
So I have agents here.

2317
03:12:43,659 --> 03:12:47,659
Send agents on missions, manage unruly crowds, and fight for influence over the city.

2318
03:12:49,100 --> 03:12:51,500
Click an agent and choose the action you wish them to carry out.

2319
03:12:52,610 --> 03:12:56,610
The bruiser is good at fighting and gaining reputation and managing crowds,

2320
03:12:56,610 --> 03:12:58,290
while the diplomat takes over sections,

2321
03:12:58,290 --> 03:13:01,170
nurtures relations with factions, and lowers fervor in sections.

2322
03:13:01,889 --> 03:13:03,649
Weaker in duels against enemy agents.

2323
03:13:05,620 --> 03:13:07,139
This has opened up a whole new game here.

2324
03:13:08,399 --> 03:13:10,959
You can move your agents freely between your sections.

2325
03:13:10,959 --> 03:13:13,040
Unfortunately, in hostile or neutral sections,

2326
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,200
they can only move one space per day.

2327
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:18,540
So this is controlled by me.

2328
03:13:28,079 --> 03:13:31,360
So does the red faction the people?

2329
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:32,319
Attitude neutral.

2330
03:13:36,829 --> 03:13:38,670
Lower the crowds fervor in the section.

2331
03:13:40,719 --> 03:13:42,239
District fully upgraded.

2332
03:13:44,110 --> 03:13:45,389
Can I move here?

2333
03:13:45,389 --> 03:13:47,950
I'm going to send a diplomat to the people.

2334
03:13:50,420 --> 03:13:52,020
Lower the crowds fervor.

2335
03:13:52,020 --> 03:13:53,940
Increase your influence over the district.

2336
03:13:54,500 --> 03:13:58,049
And what about down here?

2337
03:14:02,829 --> 03:14:04,110
Take over an enemy section.

2338
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:10,350
Raphael Clovis is unlocking a section.

2339
03:14:11,469 --> 03:14:11,790
Okay.

2340
03:14:18,989 --> 03:14:21,229
There's a lot going on here.

2341
03:14:21,229 --> 03:14:22,270
I still haven't moved up?

2342
03:14:22,270 --> 03:14:22,909
What happened to you?

2343
03:14:25,020 --> 03:14:25,579
Did he die?

2344
03:14:28,209 --> 03:14:28,530
Fell?

2345
03:14:28,530 --> 03:14:29,250
Oh, that was the...

2346
03:14:29,250 --> 03:14:30,530
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

2347
03:14:31,819 --> 03:14:33,100
I can't move up a slot here?

2348
03:14:34,819 --> 03:14:36,500
Oh, we got two new people.

2349
03:14:36,500 --> 03:14:43,459
This is not the guy that I just sent out.

2350
03:14:43,459 --> 03:14:44,180
He's not...

2351
03:14:44,180 --> 03:14:44,899
No, no, no, no.

2352
03:14:44,899 --> 03:14:46,020
You guys, this is the...

2353
03:14:46,020 --> 03:14:49,899
He's not dead.

2354
03:14:49,899 --> 03:14:50,540
Is that guy dead?

2355
03:14:52,770 --> 03:14:56,340
No.

2356
03:14:56,340 --> 03:14:57,139
All right.

2357
03:14:57,139 --> 03:14:58,100
This is the main section.

2358
03:14:58,739 --> 03:14:59,969
Let's go back here.

2359
03:15:00,770 --> 03:15:01,569
Wait.

2360
03:15:01,569 --> 03:15:03,180
I have something here.

2361
03:15:04,299 --> 03:15:19,680
There's nothing in there?

2362
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:22,129
What the fuck?

2363
03:15:22,129 --> 03:15:23,569
The more sections under your control,

2364
03:15:23,569 --> 03:15:25,649
the faster the monument is constructed.

2365
03:15:26,829 --> 03:15:28,430
Each subsequent stage of completion

2366
03:15:28,430 --> 03:15:29,870
allows you to take over another building

2367
03:15:29,870 --> 03:15:30,829
near the monument.

2368
03:15:34,270 --> 03:15:40,319
Uh, I mean, I have to do the...

2369
03:15:40,319 --> 03:15:40,799
Look at me!

2370
03:15:41,520 --> 03:16:00,239
I like that pedestal.

2371
03:16:00,239 --> 03:16:01,200
I don't like that pedestal.

2372
03:16:03,329 --> 03:16:04,370
No, that's fine.

2373
03:16:04,370 --> 03:16:04,850
That's good.

2374
03:16:10,319 --> 03:16:12,319
Why is the judge commissioning statues?

2375
03:16:13,899 --> 03:16:14,780
Yeah, it's almost like they added

2376
03:16:14,780 --> 03:16:19,969
another video game here.

2377
03:16:19,969 --> 03:16:21,010
Each building lets you perform

2378
03:16:21,010 --> 03:16:21,809
a different kind of action.

2379
03:16:21,809 --> 03:16:22,450
Take over the ones

2380
03:16:22,450 --> 03:16:23,969
that support your play style.

2381
03:16:24,610 --> 03:16:30,159
Whenever you finish a stage of construction,

2382
03:16:30,159 --> 03:16:31,920
you'll be able to seize another building.

2383
03:16:31,920 --> 03:16:33,520
Why am I seizing my own residence?

2384
03:16:34,159 --> 03:16:41,600
Spend more time with your family

2385
03:16:42,620 --> 03:16:44,780
or facilitate the persuasions.

2386
03:16:46,459 --> 03:16:47,180
I need points.

2387
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:51,040
I only have one influence point.

2388
03:16:55,469 --> 03:16:56,430
I don't think I can do anything now.

2389
03:16:56,989 --> 03:17:09,729
How do I get back to the judge game?

2390
03:17:15,700 --> 03:17:18,159
End of the day.

2391
03:17:18,159 --> 03:17:19,840
You're gonna unlock the battle royale mode

2392
03:17:19,840 --> 03:17:20,319
in 10 days?

2393
03:17:21,360 --> 03:17:22,159
There's a lot of stuff.

2394
03:17:22,799 --> 03:17:28,420
Yeah, this game just came out today,

2395
03:17:28,420 --> 03:17:29,379
by the way, if you're curious.

2396
03:17:29,379 --> 03:17:30,260
A bloody beginning.

2397
03:17:30,979 --> 03:17:32,100
A violent prologue

2398
03:17:32,100 --> 03:17:34,340
announced by a flowing red curtain.

2399
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:39,040
The wrath of strangers

2400
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:40,399
made me sick to my stomach.

2401
03:17:41,360 --> 03:17:42,959
Feet stirred dark puddles.

2402
03:17:43,760 --> 03:17:45,760
The air tasted like iron.

2403
03:17:46,780 --> 03:17:48,299
Their heads, someone cried.

2404
03:17:51,170 --> 03:17:52,530
Anger hidden in the shadows.

2405
03:17:53,329 --> 03:17:55,329
Thousands of cries from a single throat.

2406
03:17:56,129 --> 03:17:56,930
Here was a beast

2407
03:17:56,930 --> 03:17:58,530
with hundreds of claws and teeth.

2408
03:17:59,090 --> 03:18:00,049
What, was that a monster?

2409
03:18:01,010 --> 03:18:05,299
A kicked, abused,

2410
03:18:05,299 --> 03:18:06,659
and physically wounded soul.

2411
03:18:08,340 --> 03:18:08,899
Their heads.

2412
03:18:09,700 --> 03:18:11,540
What a cold and urgent order.

2413
03:18:12,260 --> 03:18:13,459
The beast's eyes

2414
03:18:13,459 --> 03:18:15,219
showed a long disguised bitterness.

2415
03:18:15,860 --> 03:18:16,819
Yesterday's envy.

2416
03:18:20,879 --> 03:18:22,079
It has waited too long

2417
03:18:22,079 --> 03:18:23,040
to show mercy now.

2418
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:25,520
Too long covering its ears

2419
03:18:25,520 --> 03:18:26,559
while others laughed

2420
03:18:26,559 --> 03:18:28,319
at its inadequacies and feebleness.

2421
03:18:33,309 --> 03:18:35,309
The beast's bark was filled

2422
03:18:35,309 --> 03:18:37,069
with a thousand smiles

2423
03:18:37,069 --> 03:18:39,149
of those who worshiped this bloody moment.

2424
03:18:40,270 --> 03:18:42,510
The day when their enemies will perish.

2425
03:18:42,510 --> 03:18:43,709
Is this a metaphor?

2426
03:18:45,149 --> 03:18:45,790
They're brothers.

2427
03:18:52,020 --> 03:18:52,420
You think?

2428
03:18:56,100 --> 03:18:58,500
It's just dogs attacking each other.

2429
03:19:01,059 --> 03:19:01,860
This is murder.

2430
03:19:05,760 --> 03:19:06,879
It's all literal.

2431
03:19:08,989 --> 03:19:09,870
All right, so let me,

2432
03:19:09,870 --> 03:19:10,750
oh, let me look at this.

2433
03:19:16,159 --> 03:19:18,219
Let's see.

2434
03:19:19,940 --> 03:19:21,540
Bruno Hugo, 26,

2435
03:19:21,540 --> 03:19:23,860
is a groom working for the wealthy

2436
03:19:23,860 --> 03:19:25,379
and influential aristocrat

2437
03:19:25,379 --> 03:19:27,379
Jean-Claude de Jacquemart.

2438
03:19:28,100 --> 03:19:28,819
During a quarrel,

2439
03:19:28,819 --> 03:19:30,659
he was seen to push his employer

2440
03:19:30,659 --> 03:19:31,780
down the stairs,

2441
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:34,020
resulting in the aristocrat's death.

2442
03:19:34,819 --> 03:19:36,420
It is significant for the case

2443
03:19:36,420 --> 03:19:38,899
that due to his origin and low intellect,

2444
03:19:39,540 --> 03:19:40,739
Bruno Hugo is known

2445
03:19:40,739 --> 03:19:42,899
in the local community as a village idiot.

2446
03:19:44,459 --> 03:19:45,979
The witnesses testified

2447
03:19:45,979 --> 03:19:48,620
that Jacquemart returned from a ride

2448
03:19:48,620 --> 03:19:49,659
displeased with the way

2449
03:19:49,659 --> 03:19:51,180
Bruno had prepared his horse.

2450
03:19:52,139 --> 03:19:54,940
Apparently, the saddle had become so loose

2451
03:19:54,940 --> 03:19:56,700
that Citizen de Jacquemart

2452
03:19:56,700 --> 03:19:58,059
almost fell from his mount.

2453
03:19:58,860 --> 03:20:00,620
The victim called for Bruno

2454
03:20:00,620 --> 03:20:02,139
in order to scold him

2455
03:20:02,139 --> 03:20:03,100
and began insulting

2456
03:20:03,100 --> 03:20:05,340
and physically abusing the stable boy.

2457
03:20:06,479 --> 03:20:08,799
When acting on an impulse,

2458
03:20:08,799 --> 03:20:10,559
Bruno pushed his employer away.

2459
03:20:11,120 --> 03:20:12,719
As a result, Citizen de Jacquemart

2460
03:20:12,719 --> 03:20:14,559
landed at the foot of the stairs

2461
03:20:14,559 --> 03:20:15,920
with a twisted neck.

2462
03:20:16,719 --> 03:20:17,520
The incident happened

2463
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:19,120
in front of other employees.

2464
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:21,120
Bruno Hugo escaped to the stable

2465
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:22,559
where he was later found,

2466
03:20:22,559 --> 03:20:23,440
pale with fright

2467
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:24,399
and whispering something

2468
03:20:24,399 --> 03:20:25,280
to one of the horses.

2469
03:20:29,739 --> 03:20:31,100
A quiddle from the common folk

2470
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:31,979
and from family

2471
03:20:33,100 --> 03:20:35,260
and prison for the revolutionaries.

2472
03:20:37,659 --> 03:20:40,530
So we got some info here.

2473
03:20:40,530 --> 03:20:44,260
Let's go ahead and start this theory.

2474
03:20:45,219 --> 03:20:49,219
So, twisted neck is

2475
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:53,059
no, no, no, no.

2476
03:20:53,059 --> 03:20:55,700
The village idiot is personality.

2477
03:20:59,809 --> 03:21:02,770
Groom is what the witness does.

2478
03:21:06,399 --> 03:21:11,840
Loose saddle is the accusation.

2479
03:21:20,459 --> 03:21:22,059
Loose saddle, no, that's the motive.

2480
03:21:22,059 --> 03:21:23,340
No, it's not.

2481
03:21:23,340 --> 03:21:24,379
That's the method.

2482
03:21:24,379 --> 03:21:28,989
Uh-oh, there was no motive.

2483
03:21:32,500 --> 03:21:32,899
Hold on.

2484
03:21:38,270 --> 03:21:38,989
God damn it.

2485
03:21:39,709 --> 03:21:42,739
I'm going to go like Gargo with salt water.

2486
03:21:42,739 --> 03:21:51,219
This is starting to get really fucking annoying.

2487
03:21:51,860 --> 03:21:53,969
All right, return for his ride.

2488
03:21:53,969 --> 03:21:55,329
Okay, the witness testified that

2489
03:21:56,129 --> 03:21:57,409
Jacques returned from a ride,

2490
03:21:57,969 --> 03:21:59,090
displeased from the way

2491
03:21:59,090 --> 03:22:00,290
that Bruno prepared his horse.

2492
03:22:01,940 --> 03:22:03,059
The saddle was so loose

2493
03:22:03,059 --> 03:22:04,260
that he almost fell.

2494
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:07,459
Okay, so that's the method.

2495
03:22:08,180 --> 03:22:10,540
So then we've got

2496
03:22:11,100 --> 03:22:12,139
return from a ride

2497
03:22:13,309 --> 03:22:14,350
that was a witness, right?

2498
03:22:14,909 --> 03:22:21,840
There's been too much learning

2499
03:22:21,840 --> 03:22:23,440
on these streams recently.

2500
03:22:26,780 --> 03:22:28,700
Shout and struggle, uh, that's

2501
03:22:31,760 --> 03:22:33,040
I mean, is that method?

2502
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:34,079
Twisted neck is

2503
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:37,170
that's not an accusation.

2504
03:22:37,170 --> 03:22:37,729
That's not a witness.

2505
03:22:37,729 --> 03:22:38,450
That's not a motive.

2506
03:22:38,450 --> 03:22:39,569
That's the method, right?

2507
03:22:40,450 --> 03:22:43,940
Like if you break your neck,

2508
03:22:43,940 --> 03:22:45,780
that's the method by breaking your neck

2509
03:22:45,780 --> 03:22:46,899
was falling down the stairs

2510
03:22:47,540 --> 03:22:50,979
or it could be a trap.

2511
03:22:55,620 --> 03:22:56,260
I don't buy that.

2512
03:22:56,899 --> 03:23:07,819
So he was

2513
03:23:07,819 --> 03:23:09,420
the victim called for Bruno to scold him

2514
03:23:09,420 --> 03:23:11,819
began insulting and abusing the stable boy.

2515
03:23:13,540 --> 03:23:18,020
So shout and struggle is the method

2516
03:23:18,659 --> 03:23:20,510
or the accusation.

2517
03:23:24,930 --> 03:23:26,690
It's method, motive, or accusation.

2518
03:23:27,329 --> 03:23:32,959
Okay, yeah.

2519
03:23:34,370 --> 03:23:36,690
Then it's only three more.

2520
03:23:37,809 --> 03:23:41,170
Groom is the offender's personality.

2521
03:23:41,889 --> 03:23:42,930
Oh, that's a trap.

2522
03:23:42,930 --> 03:23:44,049
How is that the trap?

2523
03:23:45,549 --> 03:23:45,790
What?

2524
03:23:46,510 --> 03:23:48,829
The twisted neck method is not the trap?

2525
03:23:49,549 --> 03:23:54,610
Well, that sucks.

2526
03:23:55,250 --> 03:24:00,940
This is a simple case.

2527
03:24:00,940 --> 03:24:02,379
The accused is guilty of murder

2528
03:24:02,379 --> 03:24:03,180
and the only problem is

2529
03:24:03,180 --> 03:24:04,700
that people feel sorry for him.

2530
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:05,979
What's your name?

2531
03:24:06,620 --> 03:24:08,850
Bruno Hugo.

2532
03:24:08,850 --> 03:24:09,889
I'm Bruno Hugo.

2533
03:24:10,930 --> 03:24:13,170
Do you work for citizen Jean-Claude de Jacquemin?

2534
03:24:14,399 --> 03:24:16,079
Yes, I worked there for a few years.

2535
03:24:16,079 --> 03:24:16,639
Quite a few.

2536
03:24:17,809 --> 03:24:18,610
Leave him alone.

2537
03:24:18,610 --> 03:24:19,969
He's just a man child.

2538
03:24:21,229 --> 03:24:22,430
Do you admit to the murder?

2539
03:24:22,430 --> 03:24:22,989
Yes or no?

2540
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:24,639
But I...

2541
03:24:25,889 --> 03:24:26,530
Poor thing.

2542
03:24:26,530 --> 03:24:27,729
He's shaking all over.

2543
03:24:30,979 --> 03:24:32,180
All right, I need three more.

2544
03:24:32,180 --> 03:24:32,899
I can't fuck this up.

2545
03:24:33,459 --> 03:24:35,840
Twisted neck.

2546
03:24:35,840 --> 03:24:36,559
There's no more trap.

2547
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:40,290
Twisted neck is the method

2548
03:24:44,239 --> 03:24:45,520
that he broke his neck.

2549
03:24:47,899 --> 03:24:49,180
Shout and struggle is...

2550
03:24:49,899 --> 03:24:50,930
What?

2551
03:24:50,930 --> 03:24:53,280
Is another one for shout and struggle?

2552
03:24:53,280 --> 03:24:55,520
Return from a ride as the witness said, right?

2553
03:24:55,520 --> 03:24:56,159
Let me see this.

2554
03:24:59,420 --> 03:25:00,620
The witness has testified

2555
03:25:00,620 --> 03:25:04,719
that Jacques returned from a ride, right?

2556
03:25:10,219 --> 03:25:11,420
Village Idiot Streamer.

2557
03:25:12,799 --> 03:25:16,180
And then the personality of the...

2558
03:25:17,459 --> 03:25:17,700
Yeah.

2559
03:25:18,579 --> 03:25:19,379
Okay, we're good.

2560
03:25:19,379 --> 03:25:20,340
Because that's the personality

2561
03:25:20,340 --> 03:25:21,940
of the guy that was fucking strangling him.

2562
03:25:23,069 --> 03:25:23,709
Okay, here we go.

2563
03:25:25,229 --> 03:25:27,309
Do you know how local people refer to you?

2564
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:31,200
Bruno does not know.

2565
03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:31,920
Does not know.

2566
03:25:33,229 --> 03:25:34,190
Village Idiot.

2567
03:25:34,190 --> 03:25:35,469
Do you wish to comment on this?

2568
03:25:35,469 --> 03:25:36,829
Why am I doing that?

2569
03:25:37,389 --> 03:25:39,549
Bruno does not like that name.

2570
03:25:39,549 --> 03:25:39,790
No.

2571
03:25:40,430 --> 03:25:42,530
Do they often call you that?

2572
03:25:44,129 --> 03:25:45,569
It's mocking him.

2573
03:25:45,569 --> 03:25:47,409
No, I don't like it.

2574
03:25:47,409 --> 03:25:48,049
And that's that.

2575
03:25:48,049 --> 03:25:48,930
I already have a name

2576
03:25:49,569 --> 03:25:50,690
given to me by my mother.

2577
03:25:50,690 --> 03:25:51,569
She gave me one.

2578
03:25:52,620 --> 03:25:53,659
What is this?

2579
03:25:53,659 --> 03:25:54,620
Well, is this nickname

2580
03:25:54,620 --> 03:25:57,340
the reason you push Citizen Jacques Le Guard

2581
03:25:57,340 --> 03:25:58,139
down the stairs?

2582
03:25:58,860 --> 03:26:00,399
The master was shouting

2583
03:26:00,399 --> 03:26:01,760
and I don't like it when he shouts.

2584
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:02,479
I don't like it.

2585
03:26:09,309 --> 03:26:11,870
Uh...

2586
03:26:11,870 --> 03:26:13,790
Are you aware that you have killed a man?

2587
03:26:13,790 --> 03:26:14,909
Do you understand that?

2588
03:26:16,940 --> 03:26:17,340
I know.

2589
03:26:17,979 --> 03:26:19,180
I just swung my arm

2590
03:26:19,180 --> 03:26:20,940
because he was shouting at me like that.

2591
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:22,059
So loud.

2592
03:26:22,059 --> 03:26:22,860
Wait, I thought he was...

2593
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:26,799
I thought he was attacking.

2594
03:26:28,540 --> 03:26:30,139
Were you aware that you could hurt him?

2595
03:26:31,170 --> 03:26:31,969
I didn't think so.

2596
03:26:31,969 --> 03:26:32,450
I didn't.

2597
03:26:35,059 --> 03:26:37,219
Did you swing so hard that he fell down?

2598
03:26:38,479 --> 03:26:40,239
I got so scared I can't remember.

2599
03:26:40,239 --> 03:26:41,920
I squinted my eyes, sir.

2600
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:43,120
And when I opened them again,

2601
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:45,280
there he was lying down there downstairs.

2602
03:26:51,899 --> 03:26:53,100
He plead guilty.

2603
03:26:55,809 --> 03:26:57,170
How did Citizen Des Jacques Mar

2604
03:26:57,170 --> 03:26:57,649
treat you?

2605
03:26:58,530 --> 03:26:59,489
He was good to me.

2606
03:26:59,489 --> 03:27:00,530
Sometimes he shouted,

2607
03:27:00,530 --> 03:27:02,850
but he fed me and was good to the horses.

2608
03:27:02,850 --> 03:27:03,170
Good.

2609
03:27:03,809 --> 03:27:05,360
How often did he shout?

2610
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:07,040
Sometimes he shouted.

2611
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:07,840
Sometimes he didn't.

2612
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:11,600
Aristocrat scoundrel.

2613
03:27:12,420 --> 03:27:14,100
Is that why you decided to kill him?

2614
03:27:15,229 --> 03:27:16,819
Uh...

2615
03:27:16,819 --> 03:27:18,579
First he was tormented by the nobleman

2616
03:27:18,579 --> 03:27:19,860
and now by the revolution.

2617
03:27:20,579 --> 03:27:24,959
Please call in, uh...

2618
03:27:24,959 --> 03:27:26,159
Please call in.

2619
03:27:26,159 --> 03:27:27,040
Call in.

2620
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:27,760
Please call in.

2621
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:28,319
Please call in.

2622
03:27:28,319 --> 03:27:28,719
Call in.

2623
03:27:33,649 --> 03:27:35,489
Please introduce yourself and state your duties.

2624
03:27:37,250 --> 03:27:38,530
My name is Colin Bouffieu.

2625
03:27:38,530 --> 03:27:40,530
I am the major domo at the residence

2626
03:27:40,530 --> 03:27:42,770
of the Des Jacques Mar family

2627
03:27:42,770 --> 03:27:44,049
and saw exactly what happened.

2628
03:27:45,489 --> 03:27:46,610
Please tell us what happened

2629
03:27:46,610 --> 03:27:47,569
between Citizen Hugo

2630
03:27:47,569 --> 03:27:49,090
and the master of the horses on that day.

2631
03:27:49,889 --> 03:27:50,850
What do you think of the groom?

2632
03:27:51,489 --> 03:27:52,129
Tell us what happened.

2633
03:27:53,899 --> 03:27:55,420
Citizen Des Jacques Mar

2634
03:27:55,420 --> 03:27:56,620
was furious at Bruno

2635
03:27:56,620 --> 03:27:58,540
because he hadn't tightened the saddle.

2636
03:27:58,540 --> 03:28:00,059
Could have caused an accident.

2637
03:28:01,569 --> 03:28:03,250
How did your employer react to this?

2638
03:28:04,379 --> 03:28:06,059
He started shouting at Bruno.

2639
03:28:06,620 --> 03:28:08,139
Tugging and pulling at him.

2640
03:28:08,139 --> 03:28:10,459
Bruno pushed Citizen Des Jacques Mar away

2641
03:28:10,459 --> 03:28:12,299
causing him to fall down the stairs

2642
03:28:12,299 --> 03:28:13,579
they were both standing on.

2643
03:28:14,590 --> 03:28:15,549
Nasty bourgeois.

2644
03:28:20,020 --> 03:28:20,979
Uh...

2645
03:28:20,979 --> 03:28:24,180
How do you plead?

2646
03:28:25,059 --> 03:28:26,420
I don't know what I did wrong.

2647
03:28:26,420 --> 03:28:27,139
I don't understand.

2648
03:28:27,139 --> 03:28:28,500
These people wanted me to come here

2649
03:28:28,500 --> 03:28:29,700
so I came.

2650
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:31,059
I meant no harm to nobody.

2651
03:28:31,059 --> 03:28:31,620
No harm.

2652
03:28:32,180 --> 03:28:34,500
You're facing the death penalty

2653
03:28:34,500 --> 03:28:35,139
for murder.

2654
03:28:35,139 --> 03:28:36,180
Do you realize that?

2655
03:28:36,979 --> 03:28:37,700
Is he?

2656
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:38,739
I'm jumping to that.

2657
03:28:40,770 --> 03:28:42,450
I just want to go back to the horses.

2658
03:28:42,450 --> 03:28:43,729
I don't know if they've eaten today.

2659
03:28:43,729 --> 03:28:45,729
If a horse doesn't eat for a long time

2660
03:28:45,729 --> 03:28:46,770
the master isn't happy

2661
03:28:46,770 --> 03:28:47,969
when the horses aren't fed.

2662
03:28:48,530 --> 03:28:50,850
Are you more worried about the horses

2663
03:28:50,850 --> 03:28:52,610
than your own master?

2664
03:28:52,610 --> 03:28:54,000
The master is dead.

2665
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:55,040
What can I do?

2666
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:56,639
And the horses are still alive.

2667
03:28:56,639 --> 03:28:57,360
They're alive.

2668
03:29:15,309 --> 03:29:27,649
Did the defendant confess to the crimes?

2669
03:29:28,930 --> 03:29:29,250
Yes.

2670
03:29:30,270 --> 03:29:32,590
Was his act counter-revolutionary in nature?

2671
03:29:33,549 --> 03:29:34,750
I mean not really.

2672
03:29:35,790 --> 03:29:37,549
What was the reason behind the argument

2673
03:29:37,549 --> 03:29:38,750
the defendant had with the victim?

2674
03:29:39,309 --> 03:29:40,350
A loose saddle.

2675
03:29:41,709 --> 03:29:43,790
Does the defendant understand the indictment?

2676
03:29:44,750 --> 03:29:44,989
No.

2677
03:29:50,159 --> 03:29:51,120
He didn't confess.

2678
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:51,600
Yeah, he did.

2679
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:53,040
He said like, yeah, I did it.

2680
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:53,520
He's dead.

2681
03:30:03,170 --> 03:30:04,370
You're responsible for preparing

2682
03:30:04,370 --> 03:30:05,489
the horses for the victim.

2683
03:30:06,290 --> 03:30:07,489
Yes, I combed them and fed them.

2684
03:30:07,489 --> 03:30:08,610
Horses eat a lot of grass.

2685
03:30:08,610 --> 03:30:09,170
I combed them.

2686
03:30:10,030 --> 03:30:11,309
Was the saddle loose?

2687
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:15,920
Hello?

2688
03:30:15,920 --> 03:30:16,319
Citizen?

2689
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:18,079
No, impossible.

2690
03:30:18,079 --> 03:30:19,040
I pulled the straps.

2691
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:20,079
You can't pull too hard

2692
03:30:20,079 --> 03:30:21,760
or it crushes and hurts the horse's stomach.

2693
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:22,479
Horses are good.

2694
03:30:22,479 --> 03:30:23,600
Better than humans.

2695
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:23,840
They...

2696
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:26,940
Did you want your master to fall off the horse?

2697
03:30:26,940 --> 03:30:29,340
Did you deliberately leave the girth strap loose

2698
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:30,700
to get back at your employer?

2699
03:30:31,340 --> 03:30:32,209
I never.

2700
03:30:32,209 --> 03:30:33,090
I liked our master.

2701
03:30:33,090 --> 03:30:33,729
I wouldn't hurt him.

2702
03:30:33,729 --> 03:30:34,290
I liked him.

2703
03:30:34,930 --> 03:30:37,250
You can see that he's just a gentle child.

2704
03:30:37,889 --> 03:30:43,069
People are aggressive.

2705
03:30:49,899 --> 03:30:50,620
Let him go.

2706
03:30:51,500 --> 03:30:52,459
Riot incoming.

2707
03:30:52,459 --> 03:30:53,260
I'm not a bad judge.

2708
03:30:53,260 --> 03:30:53,819
I just need to get there.

2709
03:30:53,819 --> 03:30:55,340
I got to get all the facts.

2710
03:30:56,139 --> 03:30:59,200
You still killed somebody.

2711
03:30:59,760 --> 03:31:08,340
This one makes the most sense to stay balanced.

2712
03:31:13,819 --> 03:31:15,100
Manslaughter, not murder.

2713
03:31:20,379 --> 03:31:22,299
Balance or justice.

2714
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:31,440
Saddle didn't fit.

2715
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:32,559
The saddle didn't fit.

2716
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:38,190
Yeah, that's the best for game purposes.

2717
03:31:38,190 --> 03:31:39,549
That's the best option.

2718
03:31:39,549 --> 03:31:45,229
It's death penalty.

2719
03:31:45,229 --> 03:31:47,469
Can you imagine that if I had done that?

2720
03:31:55,840 --> 03:31:58,959
I find Bruno Hugo not guilty of the aforementioned crimes

2721
03:31:58,959 --> 03:32:00,799
as he is unaware of what happened.

2722
03:32:01,360 --> 03:32:02,799
What does it matter?

2723
03:32:02,799 --> 03:32:03,920
A crime is a crime.

2724
03:32:05,969 --> 03:32:07,729
You have to be careful with the likes of this one.

2725
03:32:07,729 --> 03:32:09,170
His employer should have known better.

2726
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:19,469
Good job.

2727
03:32:19,469 --> 03:32:20,190
Bad judge.

2728
03:32:20,190 --> 03:32:20,909
I didn't get bad judge.

2729
03:32:20,909 --> 03:32:21,870
I got influence points.

2730
03:32:24,590 --> 03:32:25,469
I got to get some more water.

2731
03:32:29,819 --> 03:32:31,579
My name is Jean-Marie Rowland

2732
03:32:31,579 --> 03:32:33,180
and my name should not be unknown to you.

2733
03:32:33,180 --> 03:32:35,100
After all, you wiped your shoes on it

2734
03:32:35,100 --> 03:32:36,620
during King Louis' trial.

2735
03:32:44,209 --> 03:32:46,049
Citizen's cafe, not King.

2736
03:32:48,479 --> 03:32:50,000
King Louis Auguste Babin.

2737
03:32:52,879 --> 03:32:55,040
Thanks to you flinging around half-truths

2738
03:32:55,040 --> 03:32:56,000
and speculation.

2739
03:32:56,799 --> 03:32:58,479
Everyone is calling for my head.

2740
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:01,120
Accusing me of corruption and treason

2741
03:33:01,120 --> 03:33:03,280
while you used our backs as a stepladder

2742
03:33:03,280 --> 03:33:05,600
on your way up the social hierarchy.

2743
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:08,739
Corrupting politicians does not always work out.

2744
03:33:09,870 --> 03:33:10,989
Danton does it.

2745
03:33:10,989 --> 03:33:12,270
Melville tried to.

2746
03:33:12,270 --> 03:33:13,309
But they caught you.

2747
03:33:13,870 --> 03:33:14,350
Happens.

2748
03:33:15,229 --> 03:33:18,079
I will probably be dismissed from my station.

2749
03:33:18,799 --> 03:33:20,639
I may even end up at the guillotine.

2750
03:33:21,280 --> 03:33:24,079
But I will make sure your head rolls right after mine.

2751
03:33:24,959 --> 03:33:28,799
You will be my comrade in misery.

2752
03:33:29,760 --> 03:33:31,659
Threatening the judge of the tribunal

2753
03:33:31,659 --> 03:33:33,979
is an even worse idea than supporting a despised king

2754
03:33:33,979 --> 03:33:35,420
and corrupting politicians of the convention.

2755
03:33:38,180 --> 03:33:41,860
I will get rid of you, a candidate for captain of the guard.

2756
03:33:41,860 --> 03:33:44,030
And then I will go after you.

2757
03:33:44,829 --> 03:33:48,500
It took me and my wife too long to get used to where we are.

2758
03:33:49,139 --> 03:33:53,440
I will not die because of some over-boozed maggot

2759
03:33:53,440 --> 03:33:55,680
that likes to call himself a judge.

2760
03:33:57,040 --> 03:33:59,840
You will see how we wage war in Paris' salons.

2761
03:34:00,479 --> 03:34:13,700
You treacherous mongrel.

2762
03:34:13,780 --> 03:34:16,579
Dear comrade, I heard the news of Minister Roland's unexpected visit.

2763
03:34:18,159 --> 03:34:20,719
I have to confess that Roland knows about me

2764
03:34:20,719 --> 03:34:22,239
something that he should not have.

2765
03:34:23,870 --> 03:34:26,350
I am certain he is already weaving an intrigue against us.

2766
03:34:26,350 --> 03:34:28,270
We have to start working on one against him.

2767
03:34:29,250 --> 03:34:33,870
Francois.

2768
03:34:33,870 --> 03:34:35,629
Play something for me, son.

2769
03:34:35,629 --> 03:34:36,750
No, that's the wrong voice.

2770
03:34:36,750 --> 03:34:37,229
Wrong guy.

2771
03:34:37,790 --> 03:34:39,149
I have work to do.

2772
03:34:39,149 --> 03:34:40,350
What if we just...

2773
03:34:40,350 --> 03:34:41,389
Everyone gets the same voice.

2774
03:34:41,389 --> 03:34:42,190
Don't you guys understand?

2775
03:34:42,750 --> 03:34:44,110
As you wish, father.

2776
03:34:44,110 --> 03:34:55,219
Support the construction of the statue.

2777
03:34:55,860 --> 03:35:01,920
Increase the rate at which the statue is constructed.

2778
03:35:01,920 --> 03:35:02,479
Who cares?

2779
03:35:03,739 --> 03:35:05,020
Opening night of the theater.

2780
03:35:05,020 --> 03:35:07,100
No, I think dad's got to get happy here.

2781
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:07,739
Reading together.

2782
03:35:08,459 --> 03:35:12,059
Yeah.

2783
03:35:12,059 --> 03:35:13,260
Dad will think this is interesting.

2784
03:35:19,069 --> 03:35:21,569
Wow, mom really liked that.

2785
03:35:22,370 --> 03:35:22,870
A lot.

2786
03:35:23,489 --> 03:35:25,569
We must get four altis.

2787
03:35:29,790 --> 03:35:34,100
Ooh, what happened?

2788
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:34,600
Ooh.

2789
03:35:35,790 --> 03:35:37,549
Ooh, unlocked.

2790
03:35:37,549 --> 03:35:38,049
Uh-oh.

2791
03:35:38,670 --> 03:35:41,860
Enemy agents will fight with your agents for territory.

2792
03:35:41,860 --> 03:35:44,579
They can take over your sections with neutral sections.

2793
03:35:45,870 --> 03:35:46,670
This combat.

2794
03:35:47,389 --> 03:35:50,350
When at least two hostile agents meet in one section,

2795
03:35:51,069 --> 03:35:52,270
combat ensues.

2796
03:35:53,069 --> 03:35:56,110
Remember that a diplomat has little chance against a brutal fighter.

2797
03:35:57,860 --> 03:36:00,579
After defeating combat, your agent becomes injured.

2798
03:36:01,379 --> 03:36:04,020
They can still move around, but are not able to perform any actions.

2799
03:36:05,139 --> 03:36:06,579
Your main section is vital.

2800
03:36:07,139 --> 03:36:10,340
The buildings here enable you to influence the rest of the game.

2801
03:36:10,340 --> 03:36:12,100
Protect it at all costs.

2802
03:36:12,100 --> 03:36:14,500
If you let it out of your grasp, you will lose the game.

2803
03:36:17,180 --> 03:36:17,899
I'm sorry, I didn't mute.

2804
03:36:18,940 --> 03:36:19,879
Okay.

2805
03:36:21,709 --> 03:36:26,690
Go fucking get them.

2806
03:36:26,770 --> 03:36:27,969
Fighting. This is a diplomat, right?

2807
03:36:34,819 --> 03:36:35,620
Revolutionaries.

2808
03:36:36,260 --> 03:36:39,280
Construction of the monument, okay.

2809
03:36:39,280 --> 03:36:41,040
Why does the judge have his own militia?

2810
03:36:41,040 --> 03:36:41,760
What's down here?

2811
03:36:42,319 --> 03:36:45,340
Let's go take a look.

2812
03:36:46,139 --> 03:36:47,819
Unlock this section too.

2813
03:36:48,379 --> 03:36:53,940
Now, this is a captain versus a diplomat.

2814
03:36:54,579 --> 03:36:58,750
This guy's going to be coming out of the library with a bunch of books in his hand,

2815
03:36:58,750 --> 03:37:01,229
and this guy's going to just walk over and shoulder-attack them,

2816
03:37:01,229 --> 03:37:03,549
and he's going to go like, oh-ho, and fall backwards.

2817
03:37:04,110 --> 03:37:07,659
I'll see to this that you hang, and he's going to run away.

2818
03:37:11,469 --> 03:37:12,270
Easy.

2819
03:37:12,270 --> 03:37:17,899
Okay, so that's good.

2820
03:37:18,700 --> 03:37:19,200
Intrigue.

2821
03:37:21,809 --> 03:37:24,790
Well, there's more.

2822
03:37:25,510 --> 03:37:30,229
The documents discovered in Capay's iron cabinet raise suspicions regarding Roland.

2823
03:37:30,870 --> 03:37:34,549
The minister hates the tribunal for openly ridiculing him,

2824
03:37:34,549 --> 03:37:36,469
and he will not forgive you for it.

2825
03:37:36,469 --> 03:37:39,190
His intelligent wife holds an even stronger grudge.

2826
03:37:40,549 --> 03:37:41,909
Number of successes.

2827
03:37:41,909 --> 03:37:43,110
Three number of successes.

2828
03:37:43,110 --> 03:37:43,610
Five.

2829
03:37:47,680 --> 03:37:48,559
Action blocks.

2830
03:37:49,200 --> 03:37:53,809
Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.

2831
03:37:55,239 --> 03:37:57,399
If you carry out too few, you will lose.

2832
03:37:57,399 --> 03:38:00,200
If you perform more than necessary, you will receive a bonus.

2833
03:38:01,799 --> 03:38:03,879
Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.

2834
03:38:03,879 --> 03:38:05,159
If you carry out too few, you will win.

2835
03:38:05,159 --> 03:38:05,659
Okay.

2836
03:38:09,010 --> 03:38:10,360
The documents.

2837
03:38:12,360 --> 03:38:13,559
Successful intrigue.

2838
03:38:13,559 --> 03:38:17,270
So, convincing a witness.

2839
03:38:17,270 --> 03:38:20,149
So far, there are only rumors that Roland destroyed the documents.

2840
03:38:20,149 --> 03:38:23,350
If we find someone from his social circle to corroborate this,

2841
03:38:23,350 --> 03:38:24,790
we would gain a powerful tool.

2842
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:28,229
We have a potential candidate, Philip Cotet,

2843
03:38:28,229 --> 03:38:31,670
who was among the people who opened Capay's iron cabinet.

2844
03:38:32,389 --> 03:38:36,079
For an action to be successful,

2845
03:38:36,079 --> 03:38:38,319
you need to persuade the required number of people.

2846
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:41,760
You can also send your diplomat to do it for you.

2847
03:38:41,760 --> 03:38:44,000
Remember, you can only do this while the block is active.

2848
03:38:47,280 --> 03:38:57,180
All right.

2849
03:38:58,040 --> 03:38:58,760
So you can send it.

2850
03:38:58,760 --> 03:38:59,559
It's two points.

2851
03:38:59,559 --> 03:39:00,600
I only have like three points.

2852
03:39:03,829 --> 03:39:04,549
What if I do it?

2853
03:39:04,549 --> 03:39:05,049
Convince.

2854
03:39:05,670 --> 03:39:07,219
Can I do this?

2855
03:39:08,520 --> 03:39:10,200
Is it like a certain chance that I...

2856
03:39:12,790 --> 03:39:13,270
Oh, shit.

2857
03:39:13,270 --> 03:39:15,590
We have a string of dialogue?

2858
03:39:16,149 --> 03:39:17,430
Thank you for coming, Citizen Cotet.

2859
03:39:17,989 --> 03:39:21,670
How could I say no to a person who holds the lives of kings in the palm of his hand?

2860
03:39:22,229 --> 03:39:24,879
I presume that our meeting is connected to Minister Roland?

2861
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:26,500
Exactly.

2862
03:39:27,280 --> 03:39:29,520
I'd like to talk about the incident with the iron cabinet.

2863
03:39:30,079 --> 03:39:31,989
It is indeed rather ugly.

2864
03:39:31,989 --> 03:39:34,389
The minister could lose his head because of it,

2865
03:39:34,389 --> 03:39:36,469
although it is currently nothing more than gossip.

2866
03:39:37,940 --> 03:39:41,459
Yes, but what if the gossip suddenly turned into the truth?

2867
03:39:42,479 --> 03:39:44,239
Then things would certainly get nasty.

2868
03:39:44,879 --> 03:39:47,459
I want to get him.

2869
03:39:47,459 --> 03:39:49,079
What are you going to do to help me?

2870
03:39:49,079 --> 03:39:49,879
Carrots and sticks.

2871
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:51,639
All right, withdrawn.

2872
03:39:51,639 --> 03:39:52,520
I want to get Roland.

2873
03:39:52,520 --> 03:39:53,020
Aggressive.

2874
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:56,739
What will he get out of this?

2875
03:39:57,559 --> 03:39:58,200
Manipulate.

2876
03:39:59,510 --> 03:40:00,309
Carrot and stick.

2877
03:40:01,399 --> 03:40:02,040
Carelessness.

2878
03:40:03,280 --> 03:40:03,840
Bingo.

2879
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:04,479
Bingo.

2880
03:40:04,479 --> 03:40:04,979
Bingo.

2881
03:40:05,780 --> 03:40:09,510
Fuck.

2882
03:40:09,510 --> 03:40:11,030
No, that was right, except for this.

2883
03:40:14,629 --> 03:40:15,430
So I think it's...

2884
03:40:16,069 --> 03:40:16,389
That's...

2885
03:40:16,389 --> 03:40:17,190
This is not perfect.

2886
03:40:18,790 --> 03:40:20,549
These are both good, but neither one of them is perfect.

2887
03:40:23,799 --> 03:40:26,520
Manipulate would be perfect, but this one's not perfect.

2888
03:40:26,520 --> 03:40:27,639
What will he get out of this?

2889
03:40:28,360 --> 03:40:32,129
Maybe carelessness for this one?

2890
03:40:35,510 --> 03:40:37,270
Will strong, strong, and perfect.

2891
03:40:37,510 --> 03:40:39,190
We're strong, strong, strong, convinced.

2892
03:40:44,760 --> 03:40:45,479
I wonder.

2893
03:40:45,479 --> 03:40:47,969
Or humility.

2894
03:40:47,969 --> 03:40:50,450
I'm going to do aggression, manipulation, and humility.

2895
03:40:50,450 --> 03:40:56,629
Here we go.

2896
03:40:56,629 --> 03:40:59,459
I need Roland's head.

2897
03:40:59,459 --> 03:41:00,340
He is a pest.

2898
03:41:00,340 --> 03:41:02,739
By bribing politicians, he has harmed all of France.

2899
03:41:03,889 --> 03:41:05,969
We need the witness that saw him opening the iron chest

2900
03:41:05,969 --> 03:41:07,090
to reveal his identity.

2901
03:41:07,090 --> 03:41:07,889
We need you.

2902
03:41:08,530 --> 03:41:09,170
Sibyzen.

2903
03:41:10,600 --> 03:41:11,959
Roland has his vices,

2904
03:41:11,959 --> 03:41:14,280
but are they enough to justify my betrayal

2905
03:41:14,280 --> 03:41:16,280
because that is what you ask of me?

2906
03:41:18,209 --> 03:41:19,329
Manipulation.

2907
03:41:19,329 --> 03:41:24,159
Minister Roland will not save you

2908
03:41:24,159 --> 03:41:25,520
when matters become troublesome.

2909
03:41:25,520 --> 03:41:28,079
I can save you from charges of complicity,

2910
03:41:28,079 --> 03:41:29,440
for example, other things.

2911
03:41:30,559 --> 03:41:33,430
All right, and then humility.

2912
03:41:33,989 --> 03:41:38,469
I believe that you are a man of reason, Citizen Coat.

2913
03:41:38,469 --> 03:41:40,309
Listening to it, telling you that you do not want

2914
03:41:40,309 --> 03:41:41,670
to pay for Roland's mistakes,

2915
03:41:42,229 --> 03:41:44,069
and I do not want to make you pay for them.

2916
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:47,280
Got it.

2917
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:49,200
I will help you and testify against him.

2918
03:41:49,760 --> 03:41:51,200
Let us see where this leads.

2919
03:41:51,200 --> 03:41:52,319
But hopefully to you,

2920
03:41:52,879 --> 03:41:55,040
hopefully to my head staying on my neck,

2921
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:55,840
as you promised.

2922
03:42:02,370 --> 03:42:03,090
Got it.

2923
03:42:03,090 --> 03:42:09,700
Thank you.

2924
03:42:09,700 --> 03:42:11,059
Oh, God, spreading rumors.

2925
03:42:12,229 --> 03:42:14,069
Choosing how to resolve this.

2926
03:42:14,069 --> 03:42:16,309
Some actors require you to make decisions about tactics.

2927
03:42:16,309 --> 03:42:18,389
Each decision may have a different chance of success.

2928
03:42:23,190 --> 03:42:24,309
What is this one?

2929
03:42:24,309 --> 03:42:28,450
Courtguard Raphael Clovis,

2930
03:42:28,450 --> 03:42:29,329
your loyal subordinate,

2931
03:42:29,329 --> 03:42:31,569
will have to talk some sense into a few heads

2932
03:42:31,569 --> 03:42:33,409
so they realize how big a threat Roland is.

2933
03:42:34,049 --> 03:42:37,409
Or a few casual remarks made by the respected Jacques-Louis David

2934
03:42:37,409 --> 03:42:38,690
should unleash an avalanche.

2935
03:42:41,909 --> 03:42:43,110
Chance of success is 10%.

2936
03:42:43,989 --> 03:42:45,989
Or plus 10%.

2937
03:42:46,870 --> 03:42:48,370
Does that not get-

2938
03:42:48,370 --> 03:42:49,170
That's not gonna-

2939
03:42:49,170 --> 03:42:50,290
10% chance?

2940
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:54,639
Or is that added on top?

2941
03:42:59,569 --> 03:43:01,399
I don't think it's worth doing.

2942
03:43:04,840 --> 03:43:06,600
We'll do, ah, diplomacy.

2943
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:10,520
Intrigues are carried out in a matter of days.

2944
03:43:10,520 --> 03:43:11,799
The results of some action blocks

2945
03:43:11,799 --> 03:43:13,399
may only be seen the next day.

2946
03:43:14,120 --> 03:43:15,649
So that's plus 10%, okay?

2947
03:43:16,370 --> 03:43:21,110
Okay.

2948
03:43:21,110 --> 03:43:22,309
How is that a failed intrigue?

2949
03:43:22,950 --> 03:43:24,129
I think we're good.

2950
03:43:24,850 --> 03:43:27,920
Added from the one before, okay?

2951
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:28,799
What happened here?

2952
03:43:28,799 --> 03:43:29,200
They're just-

2953
03:43:29,200 --> 03:43:29,680
They're fighting.

2954
03:43:30,479 --> 03:43:31,520
All right, we'll end the day.

2955
03:43:33,829 --> 03:43:44,680
It's a cool game, it is.

2956
03:43:46,440 --> 03:43:47,799
All right, here we go.

2957
03:43:47,799 --> 03:43:50,040
Revolutionaries want the death penalty,

2958
03:43:50,760 --> 03:43:52,819
and common folk want acquittal.

2959
03:43:53,540 --> 03:43:56,559
He fell in love with Marie Antoinette.

2960
03:43:57,280 --> 03:43:59,760
Are you Mr. Antoine Barnet?

2961
03:44:03,270 --> 03:44:03,670
I am.

2962
03:44:05,000 --> 03:44:07,000
Did you and your mistress Marie Antoinette

2963
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:07,959
plot against France?

2964
03:44:09,430 --> 03:44:10,870
There are so many lies in your-

2965
03:44:10,870 --> 03:44:11,510
No, wait, wrong.

2966
03:44:13,750 --> 03:44:15,430
There are so many lies in your question

2967
03:44:15,430 --> 03:44:17,350
that I cannot decide which one to deny first.

2968
03:44:18,819 --> 03:44:21,139
He tries to defend himself with pretty words.

2969
03:44:22,559 --> 03:44:23,920
So are you not pleading guilty?

2970
03:44:24,639 --> 03:44:25,909
Of course not.

2971
03:44:28,659 --> 03:44:29,860
All we got here, we've got-

2972
03:44:31,159 --> 03:44:33,559
Your Highness, I am certain that our shared efforts

2973
03:44:33,559 --> 03:44:35,079
will convince the people of France

2974
03:44:35,079 --> 03:44:36,280
to preserve the monarchy.

2975
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:39,159
The loss of your wisdom and kindness

2976
03:44:39,159 --> 03:44:40,600
would be too tragic a blow

2977
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:43,159
for the state to afford yours, Antoine.

2978
03:44:43,159 --> 03:44:44,280
What else do we have here?

2979
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:45,319
We have this case file.

2980
03:44:49,190 --> 03:44:51,110
Treason, advocating monarchy,

2981
03:44:51,110 --> 03:44:52,469
and counterrevolution.

2982
03:44:57,799 --> 03:45:13,399
Defendant is Antoine Barnet, a 32-year-old politician

2983
03:45:13,399 --> 03:45:15,239
and famous orator.

2984
03:45:16,239 --> 03:45:19,360
Parisians remember him from his fiery speech

2985
03:45:19,360 --> 03:45:26,629
defending the constitutional monarchy.

2986
03:45:26,629 --> 03:45:28,469
He is known as a fierce enemy of the republic

2987
03:45:28,469 --> 03:45:29,510
and protector of the king.

2988
03:45:30,069 --> 03:45:31,430
Seeing that his political efforts

2989
03:45:31,430 --> 03:45:33,430
were fruitless, he joined the National Guard.

2990
03:45:34,229 --> 03:45:34,790
Excuse me.

2991
03:45:42,020 --> 03:45:45,940
In 1791, during the notorious flight to Varans,

2992
03:45:46,579 --> 03:45:48,420
the Capets were detained by the Guard.

2993
03:45:49,059 --> 03:45:50,979
Antoine Barnet and two of the soldiers

2994
03:45:50,979 --> 03:45:53,540
were ordered to escort the fugitives back to Paris.

2995
03:45:55,670 --> 03:45:57,829
When Barnet met Marie Antoinette,

2996
03:45:57,829 --> 03:45:59,590
he was absolutely charmed.

2997
03:46:00,309 --> 03:46:02,389
The two developed a potentially sexual,

2998
03:46:02,389 --> 03:46:04,309
potentially sexual relationship.

2999
03:46:05,190 --> 03:46:07,270
Later, they were frequently writing to each other.

3000
03:46:07,829 --> 03:46:10,229
In her letters, Marie Antoinette often expressed

3001
03:46:10,229 --> 03:46:12,389
hope for the survival of absolute monarchy.

3002
03:46:13,909 --> 03:46:17,030
Not long after, Barnet joined the Jacobins,

3003
03:46:17,030 --> 03:46:18,229
hoping to help the Capets

3004
03:46:18,229 --> 03:46:19,430
and alleviate the radical approach

3005
03:46:19,430 --> 03:46:20,309
of the revolutionaries

3006
03:46:20,309 --> 03:46:22,149
towards Citizen Capet and Marie Antoinette.

3007
03:46:22,950 --> 03:46:25,190
His efforts, however, were futile.

3008
03:46:25,909 --> 03:46:27,670
Due to his sympathy towards the monarchy

3009
03:46:27,670 --> 03:46:30,469
and the Capets, especially Marie Antoinette,

3010
03:46:30,469 --> 03:46:32,149
he was under constant surveillance.

3011
03:46:32,870 --> 03:46:35,110
Now we have finally managed to collect enough evidence

3012
03:46:35,110 --> 03:46:36,870
against him to file an indictment.

3013
03:46:37,510 --> 03:46:39,030
One of the pieces of evidence is

3014
03:46:39,030 --> 03:46:41,590
his correspondence with Marie Antoinette,

3015
03:46:41,590 --> 03:46:42,629
which potentially proves

3016
03:46:42,629 --> 03:46:44,309
his counter-revolutionary tendencies.

3017
03:46:45,110 --> 03:46:47,590
Antoine Barnet ought to be punished

3018
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:49,190
like any other enemy of the revolution.

3019
03:46:49,909 --> 03:46:51,270
And the evidence is a letter

3020
03:46:51,270 --> 03:46:52,870
Barnet wrote to Marie Antoinette.

3021
03:46:53,989 --> 03:46:56,629
Okay, so, famous orator.

3022
03:46:59,989 --> 03:47:02,549
Ordered to escort the fugitives back to Paris.

3023
03:47:04,020 --> 03:47:07,459
Okay, met Marie Antoinette,

3024
03:47:07,459 --> 03:47:09,780
was absolutely charmed.

3025
03:47:09,780 --> 03:47:11,059
They developed a relationship.

3026
03:47:11,059 --> 03:47:12,340
They write back and forth.

3027
03:47:13,219 --> 03:47:15,299
Had some sympathy towards the monarchy

3028
03:47:16,120 --> 03:47:17,079
and wrote some letters.

3029
03:47:19,700 --> 03:47:22,260
Okay, so, famous orator.

3030
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:24,120
That's a personality.

3031
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:25,879
We have letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.

3032
03:47:27,399 --> 03:47:28,040
That's evidence.

3033
03:47:28,680 --> 03:47:29,959
Sympathy towards the monarchs.

3034
03:47:31,079 --> 03:47:32,120
That's the not motive.

3035
03:47:32,840 --> 03:47:36,610
That's personality or counter-revolution.

3036
03:47:37,430 --> 03:47:38,870
Charmed by the queen.

3037
03:47:38,870 --> 03:47:44,069
That's what we like to call a Marie Antoinette.

3038
03:47:45,750 --> 03:47:51,729
That's it.

3039
03:47:51,729 --> 03:47:53,559
Okay, four more questions.

3040
03:47:54,850 --> 03:47:55,889
Letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.

3041
03:47:55,889 --> 03:47:56,610
This is evidence?

3042
03:47:56,610 --> 03:47:58,530
No, this is the motive.

3043
03:47:59,409 --> 03:48:01,809
Personality.

3044
03:48:02,690 --> 03:48:08,370
Fuck.

3045
03:48:08,370 --> 03:48:09,729
Escorting Citizen Capay.

3046
03:48:11,159 --> 03:48:13,590
That is motive.

3047
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:14,090
Dude.

3048
03:48:17,350 --> 03:48:24,549
God damn it.

3049
03:48:31,360 --> 03:48:32,719
I didn't even need to click that.

3050
03:48:45,750 --> 03:48:49,329
Okay, after this,

3051
03:48:49,889 --> 03:48:51,329
I gotta get some fucking water.

3052
03:48:52,129 --> 03:48:54,440
Get some fucking salt.

3053
03:48:57,200 --> 03:48:58,719
Uh, I can't make any more mistakes, though.

3054
03:48:58,719 --> 03:48:59,360
So, we've got...

3055
03:49:01,030 --> 03:49:01,909
This is just...

3056
03:49:01,909 --> 03:49:03,909
Letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.

3057
03:49:03,909 --> 03:49:05,430
Is extenuating circumstance.

3058
03:49:06,069 --> 03:49:12,069
And then, is Marie Antoinette the motive?

3059
03:49:12,069 --> 03:49:12,629
Hold on.

3060
03:49:12,629 --> 03:49:13,129
No, no, wait.

3061
03:49:16,959 --> 03:49:18,479
Yeah, he's either too developed to say that

3062
03:49:18,479 --> 03:49:20,239
later they were frequently writing letters to Marie Antoinette

3063
03:49:20,239 --> 03:49:22,479
to express hope for the survival of absolute monarchy, right?

3064
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:27,520
And then, the evidence is letters that he wrote to Marie Antoinette.

3065
03:49:34,579 --> 03:49:35,860
Replenish your electrolytes.

3066
03:49:35,860 --> 03:49:36,579
Yeah, I'm going to.

3067
03:49:37,559 --> 03:49:39,639
Unfortunately, this stream is gonna probably cut short.

3068
03:49:40,280 --> 03:49:45,299
Because this is really starting to cause me anguish.

3069
03:49:49,879 --> 03:49:50,840
Charmed by the Queen.

3070
03:49:51,559 --> 03:49:53,799
I don't know if that's motive or just extenuating.

3071
03:49:59,920 --> 03:50:01,040
No, the absolute...

3072
03:50:01,040 --> 03:50:03,280
I'm not going to not stream Sekiro tomorrow.

3073
03:50:03,280 --> 03:50:03,840
You kidding me?

3074
03:50:05,200 --> 03:50:07,040
If anything, I want to get ready for it.

3075
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:10,239
I want to get some rest and save my throat.

3076
03:50:10,879 --> 03:50:15,170
I'm not going to play Sekiro off stream.

3077
03:50:15,170 --> 03:50:16,610
Oh my god, I've been waiting for it for so long.

3078
03:50:18,100 --> 03:50:18,659
That's motive.

3079
03:50:19,459 --> 03:50:33,969
Well, she was fucking playing him.

3080
03:50:37,190 --> 03:50:38,149
She was playing him.

3081
03:50:38,950 --> 03:50:44,450
Whatever, this guy's done.

3082
03:50:44,450 --> 03:50:46,290
I don't need this shit.

3083
03:50:46,850 --> 03:50:52,950
All right, not long ago you were on the path to a grand career.

3084
03:50:52,950 --> 03:50:56,229
I remember your famous speech in defense of Citizen Capay.

3085
03:50:56,229 --> 03:50:57,750
Your charisma could have taken you to the top,

3086
03:50:57,750 --> 03:50:59,030
but instead you are here.

3087
03:50:59,030 --> 03:50:59,989
Do you not regret it?

3088
03:51:00,790 --> 03:51:03,649
That speech was not aimed against the revolution.

3089
03:51:03,649 --> 03:51:05,809
I only wish to appeal to common sense.

3090
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:09,040
Many remember that performance as an attack

3091
03:51:09,040 --> 03:51:12,479
on everything that started in France on July 14th.

3092
03:51:13,440 --> 03:51:15,299
Nonsense.

3093
03:51:15,299 --> 03:51:17,139
The changes were essential.

3094
03:51:17,940 --> 03:51:20,579
Constitutional monarchy is a reasonable alternative

3095
03:51:20,579 --> 03:51:21,700
to the old order.

3096
03:51:22,340 --> 03:51:23,920
So in your opinion,

3097
03:51:23,920 --> 03:51:25,520
people who brought misery to France

3098
03:51:25,520 --> 03:51:26,879
should continue living in a palace.

3099
03:51:27,600 --> 03:51:30,020
I do not think they should be guillotined

3100
03:51:30,020 --> 03:51:31,379
only for their ancestry.

3101
03:51:31,940 --> 03:51:37,409
Did you ever express your feelings

3102
03:51:37,409 --> 03:51:38,690
to Marie Antoinette in your letters?

3103
03:51:40,420 --> 03:51:42,340
Did you not read our letters carefully?

3104
03:51:42,979 --> 03:51:45,139
I would not have dared to woo the Queen of France.

3105
03:51:47,239 --> 03:51:49,079
You wrote about her wisdom and kindness.

3106
03:51:49,159 --> 03:51:51,079
It sounds like you were paying her compliments.

3107
03:51:51,719 --> 03:51:53,729
Those were just pleasantries.

3108
03:51:55,190 --> 03:51:56,870
Maybe she was wooing him.

3109
03:51:56,870 --> 03:51:59,270
The Austrian whore was insatiable.

3110
03:52:01,920 --> 03:52:02,799
Kill him.

3111
03:52:02,799 --> 03:52:08,799
It would appear that in your letters,

3112
03:52:08,799 --> 03:52:10,879
Marie Antoinette, you tried to convince her

3113
03:52:11,520 --> 03:52:14,879
and her husband to support the revolution.

3114
03:52:15,680 --> 03:52:17,200
What would you gain from that?

3115
03:52:17,920 --> 03:52:20,469
I believe that we would avert the terror

3116
03:52:20,469 --> 03:52:21,670
we were currently facing.

3117
03:52:22,229 --> 03:52:24,959
Why do you think there's terror in our country?

3118
03:52:24,959 --> 03:52:27,299
I would not be standing here now otherwise.

3119
03:52:28,840 --> 03:52:31,079
You're there because you're a royal swine.

3120
03:52:31,799 --> 03:52:34,370
The Capais were not interested in the Constitution?

3121
03:52:34,930 --> 03:52:36,200
Unfortunately not.

3122
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:38,559
And how would you benefit from it?

3123
03:52:39,299 --> 03:52:39,780
I only...

3124
03:52:40,500 --> 03:52:43,000
Did I catch that?

3125
03:52:43,000 --> 03:52:43,719
I think I did.

3126
03:52:43,719 --> 03:52:45,719
I only wanted what was best for my country.

3127
03:52:49,299 --> 03:52:51,620
Were you not afraid to openly support

3128
03:52:51,620 --> 03:52:53,780
the monarchs on the eve of the revolution?

3129
03:52:53,780 --> 03:52:55,219
That could be interpreted as treason.

3130
03:52:55,860 --> 03:52:58,739
I may be young and idealistic,

3131
03:52:58,739 --> 03:52:59,700
but I'm no traitor.

3132
03:53:00,870 --> 03:53:01,670
If that were true,

3133
03:53:01,670 --> 03:53:03,670
you'd be standing on the right side.

3134
03:53:03,670 --> 03:53:05,680
I love this country,

3135
03:53:05,680 --> 03:53:07,680
and I'm certain that the republic

3136
03:53:07,680 --> 03:53:09,600
which the revolutionaries are fighting for

3137
03:53:09,600 --> 03:53:10,079
is not...

3138
03:53:10,879 --> 03:53:11,120
a...

3139
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:13,120
Anassia.

3140
03:53:15,090 --> 03:53:16,209
If you fight the republic,

3141
03:53:16,209 --> 03:53:17,329
you fight France itself.

3142
03:53:18,610 --> 03:53:20,760
What is it, snowing?

3143
03:53:20,760 --> 03:53:36,469
French YouTuber voice.

3144
03:53:37,190 --> 03:54:10,629
I'm sick of listening to your shit.

3145
03:54:11,190 --> 03:54:12,790
We already saw this movie.

3146
03:54:12,790 --> 03:54:14,309
I've no further questions, thank you.

3147
03:54:14,309 --> 03:54:15,909
I said to citizen Antoine Barnard,

3148
03:54:15,909 --> 03:54:17,110
that by the Aguiq team,

3149
03:54:18,520 --> 03:54:20,120
that's how every court should operate

3150
03:54:20,120 --> 03:54:24,100
swift and bold.

3151
03:54:24,100 --> 03:54:25,780
And does it matter what we have to say?

3152
03:54:25,780 --> 03:54:27,860
You'd better take us into account in the future.

3153
03:54:31,319 --> 03:54:32,360
Look, it's all balanced.

3154
03:54:36,000 --> 03:54:37,120
Enemy at the courthouse.

3155
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:40,280
The jury noticed you making the wrong choices

3156
03:54:40,280 --> 03:54:41,399
and forgoing justice.

3157
03:54:41,399 --> 03:54:42,440
The rumors spread fast.

3158
03:54:42,440 --> 03:54:44,040
That's what happened in reality.

3159
03:54:45,909 --> 03:54:47,829
I'm basing my shit on the book.

3160
03:54:47,829 --> 03:54:50,870
You can adapt your Game of Thrones season fucking seven

3161
03:54:50,870 --> 03:54:51,829
however you want.

3162
03:54:51,829 --> 03:54:53,350
You can change the ending.

3163
03:54:53,350 --> 03:54:54,790
Not me, I'm going right to the books.

3164
03:54:55,350 --> 03:55:07,399
Hey guys, welcome back to part 143

3165
03:55:07,399 --> 03:55:08,280
of my YouTube series.

3166
03:55:08,280 --> 03:55:09,479
Today we're going to get

3167
03:55:09,479 --> 03:55:11,959
sentenced to death for supporting the monarchy.

3168
03:55:13,239 --> 03:55:15,559
It's agent, you ordered me to silence.

3169
03:55:15,559 --> 03:55:16,920
It is done, but there's something

3170
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:18,200
you need to see for yourself.

3171
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:18,840
Who is this?

3172
03:55:19,479 --> 03:55:29,510
All right, speak to the comic book.

3173
03:55:32,559 --> 03:55:34,799
Carefree for the crime.

3174
03:55:35,360 --> 03:55:36,879
So should I be careless with this?

3175
03:55:37,680 --> 03:55:38,239
Whatever.

3176
03:55:39,440 --> 03:55:41,440
They're oversensitive about the defendant.

3177
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:47,350
Carelessness, they're oversensitive

3178
03:55:47,350 --> 03:55:48,950
so we can do some humility here.

3179
03:55:50,920 --> 03:55:52,120
And then revolution,

3180
03:55:52,120 --> 03:55:53,559
let's go straight up aggressive.

3181
03:55:56,399 --> 03:55:57,760
Perfect, strong

3182
03:55:59,350 --> 03:56:00,389
and revolution.

3183
03:56:05,120 --> 03:56:07,440
Manipulate or humility?

3184
03:56:08,159 --> 03:56:14,469
Probably manipulate.

3185
03:56:15,190 --> 03:56:21,239
Careless, humility, and manipulate.

3186
03:56:22,280 --> 03:56:27,719
For this convict here,

3187
03:56:27,719 --> 03:56:29,799
killing was as easy as breathing.

3188
03:56:29,799 --> 03:56:31,719
That's how this guillotine is to us.

3189
03:56:32,840 --> 03:56:35,200
I'm telling a joke.

3190
03:56:35,200 --> 03:56:36,159
Humility.

3191
03:56:36,159 --> 03:56:37,440
The criminals belong in the grave

3192
03:56:37,440 --> 03:56:38,879
only then we can build a better future.

3193
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:43,090
Yes, and then manipulation.

3194
03:56:43,649 --> 03:56:44,930
Future generations will remember

3195
03:56:44,930 --> 03:56:46,129
that we were not cowards.

3196
03:56:46,129 --> 03:56:46,930
It needs to be done.

3197
03:56:48,049 --> 03:56:48,850
And everyone's happy.

3198
03:56:51,270 --> 03:56:56,360
Reputation plus three.

3199
03:56:56,360 --> 03:56:57,799
I performed my duties

3200
03:56:57,799 --> 03:56:59,559
when the king was equal to France

3201
03:56:59,559 --> 03:57:01,559
and this is how France repays me.

3202
03:57:13,299 --> 03:57:14,979
Boo, for the revolution.

3203
03:57:14,979 --> 03:57:16,899
Boo, why are you always booing me?

3204
03:57:20,129 --> 03:57:27,569
That guy's usually happy.

3205
03:57:27,569 --> 03:57:29,409
Oh, he didn't get a good seat this time.

3206
03:57:30,340 --> 03:57:38,440
He didn't get her quick enough.

3207
03:57:38,440 --> 03:57:40,600
Do you want to show me a common dead body?

3208
03:57:41,760 --> 03:57:43,840
It's not just a dead body.

3209
03:57:43,840 --> 03:57:45,280
Look at that necklace.

3210
03:57:45,280 --> 03:57:45,840
It's Winston.

3211
03:57:46,479 --> 03:57:48,959
A fleur de lis.

3212
03:57:48,959 --> 03:57:50,159
That's the Winston voice actor.

3213
03:57:50,159 --> 03:57:52,479
There's more hidden under his clothes.

3214
03:57:54,790 --> 03:57:57,270
We found a message in the inner pocket of his cloak.

3215
03:57:57,270 --> 03:57:57,829
No, it's not.

3216
03:57:57,829 --> 03:57:58,549
It's an order.

3217
03:57:59,350 --> 03:58:01,190
Someone told that man to build support

3218
03:58:01,190 --> 03:58:03,510
for a mysterious R in the district.

3219
03:58:05,969 --> 03:58:08,370
Who is arrogant enough to take Louis place?

3220
03:58:08,370 --> 03:58:10,209
You guys thought my French accents weren't good.

3221
03:58:10,209 --> 03:58:11,889
Only aristocrats are powerful enough

3222
03:58:11,889 --> 03:58:13,809
to secretly organize people like him.

3223
03:58:13,809 --> 03:58:15,489
These guys have an American accent.

3224
03:58:16,129 --> 03:58:17,440
I'm at least in the same hemisphere.

3225
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:19,920
Even they would need help from someone in the convention.

3226
03:58:20,639 --> 03:58:22,079
So who is R?

3227
03:58:23,780 --> 03:58:25,059
Robespierre, maybe.

3228
03:58:25,059 --> 03:58:26,979
If he's allying with aristocrats,

3229
03:58:26,979 --> 03:58:29,459
we must tell someone, everyone.

3230
03:58:32,079 --> 03:58:33,680
It could be Minister Roland.

3231
03:58:34,479 --> 03:58:36,159
As long as we are not sure,

3232
03:58:36,159 --> 03:58:37,600
we would only create panic.

3233
03:58:39,829 --> 03:58:41,030
If that's the case,

3234
03:58:41,030 --> 03:58:42,549
we'll have to hunt down other agents.

3235
03:58:43,350 --> 03:58:44,950
This one won't be telling us anything.

3236
03:58:45,590 --> 03:58:46,629
We have no other choice.

3237
03:58:49,000 --> 03:58:51,319
If this R is trying to gain support,

3238
03:58:51,879 --> 03:58:54,120
you must do the same for the greater good.

3239
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:56,360
It's that Robespierre guy.

3240
03:58:57,079 --> 03:58:58,309
He's at the top.

3241
03:58:58,950 --> 03:59:01,729
When are they going to add vibe support?

3242
03:59:02,450 --> 03:59:04,659
The evening is warm,

3243
03:59:04,659 --> 03:59:06,260
so you decide to take the long way home.

3244
03:59:06,260 --> 03:59:07,780
Near the Café Chantilly,

3245
03:59:07,780 --> 03:59:09,219
you spot an amusing scene.

3246
03:59:09,219 --> 03:59:11,700
Two drunkards fighting over a bottle of liquor.

3247
03:59:11,700 --> 03:59:13,219
Cursing like stable boys.

3248
03:59:13,219 --> 03:59:14,260
The first is shorter

3249
03:59:14,260 --> 03:59:16,100
and dressed in a disheveled officer's uniform,

3250
03:59:16,100 --> 03:59:17,219
possibly a colonel.

3251
03:59:17,219 --> 03:59:17,940
The second fighter,

3252
03:59:17,940 --> 03:59:19,620
although significantly taller,

3253
03:59:19,620 --> 03:59:21,219
is just an ordinary street thug.

3254
03:59:21,780 --> 03:59:25,059
You listen to the gibberish and tangled epathies,

3255
03:59:25,700 --> 03:59:26,899
only to reach the conclusion

3256
03:59:26,899 --> 03:59:29,379
that the bottle contains one last gulp of drink.

3257
03:59:30,100 --> 03:59:33,159
Try to settle the dispute between the drunkards.

3258
03:59:34,040 --> 03:59:37,090
The two enemies unite in the face of a stranger

3259
03:59:37,090 --> 03:59:38,450
in an elegant coat.

3260
03:59:38,450 --> 03:59:40,370
It surely looks comical to the observers

3261
03:59:40,370 --> 03:59:42,930
when, in a fit of booze-driven solidarity,

3262
03:59:42,930 --> 03:59:44,450
one tries to hit you in the head

3263
03:59:44,450 --> 03:59:45,809
with the disputed object,

3264
03:59:46,450 --> 03:59:47,809
while the other kicks at your ankle.

3265
03:59:48,370 --> 03:59:49,250
He dodges the bottle,

3266
03:59:49,250 --> 03:59:51,170
which smashes on a nearby wall,

3267
03:59:51,170 --> 03:59:53,409
spilling the remaining alcohol everywhere.

3268
03:59:53,409 --> 03:59:55,329
However, the kick is a success

3269
03:59:55,329 --> 03:59:57,010
and immobilizes you long enough

3270
03:59:57,090 --> 03:59:59,809
for the drunkards to disappear down a back alley.

3271
03:59:59,809 --> 04:00:00,690
It takes some time

3272
04:00:00,690 --> 04:00:02,290
for the bystanders to stop laughing.

3273
04:00:02,930 --> 04:00:04,370
And I'm a judge

3274
04:00:05,090 --> 04:00:07,120
and I could literally,

3275
04:00:07,120 --> 04:00:09,600
I could have your tongue out.

3276
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:22,639
Should I do this?

3277
04:00:22,639 --> 04:00:26,260
How should I do this?

3278
04:00:26,260 --> 04:00:27,139
Evening stroll.

3279
04:00:27,139 --> 04:00:27,940
No, we're gonna,

3280
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:29,540
everyone's doing so good.

3281
04:00:30,579 --> 04:00:32,100
Evening with grandfather.

3282
04:00:32,100 --> 04:00:35,719
Yeah, it's okay to lose points here.

3283
04:00:37,600 --> 04:00:38,639
He's hard to please.

3284
04:00:38,639 --> 04:00:40,799
That's an entire evening with grandpa

3285
04:00:42,450 --> 04:00:50,690
and it's not even a centimeter dead.

3286
04:00:50,690 --> 04:00:51,569
I would.

3287
04:00:51,569 --> 04:00:57,120
Why is this on fire?

3288
04:00:58,840 --> 04:01:01,079
Riots block agents except the bruiser

3289
04:01:01,079 --> 04:01:02,920
and prevent you from gaining influence

3290
04:01:02,920 --> 04:01:03,879
points from the section.

3291
04:01:04,520 --> 04:01:05,620
When not quelled,

3292
04:01:05,620 --> 04:01:06,899
riots make a section neutral

3293
04:01:06,899 --> 04:01:07,940
and can quickly spread.

3294
04:01:10,500 --> 04:01:11,059
Get in there.

3295
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:18,639
Let's head back.

3296
04:01:21,649 --> 04:01:24,469
Increase your influence.

3297
04:01:26,229 --> 04:01:27,510
Just increase influence over here.

3298
04:01:28,229 --> 04:01:29,989
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.

3299
04:01:29,989 --> 04:01:31,030
Five community subs.

3300
04:01:31,030 --> 04:01:33,030
Thank you for the five subs.

3301
04:01:33,750 --> 04:01:37,350
Let's try to quell the unrest here.

3302
04:01:38,069 --> 04:01:40,579
But did you, did you,

3303
04:01:41,299 --> 04:01:41,780
hold on.

3304
04:01:42,340 --> 04:01:44,899
Your name used to be an all lowercase.

3305
04:01:46,069 --> 04:01:48,290
Didn't it?

3306
04:01:48,290 --> 04:01:49,329
Did you change your name

3307
04:01:49,329 --> 04:01:50,770
to add uppercase letters?

3308
04:01:54,639 --> 04:01:55,440
That's what you did.

3309
04:01:58,850 --> 04:01:59,350
Why?

3310
04:01:59,969 --> 04:02:01,010
All right.

3311
04:02:01,010 --> 04:02:01,649
I'll be right back.

3312
04:02:02,629 --> 04:02:03,350
And I actually,

3313
04:02:05,030 --> 04:02:06,879
I'm probably gonna have to stop here.

3314
04:02:07,520 --> 04:02:08,079
I'm sorry.

3315
04:02:08,719 --> 04:02:12,149
I'm getting raw in the back.

3316
04:02:12,870 --> 04:02:15,250
Sorry for like the four

3317
04:02:15,889 --> 04:02:16,930
to five hour stream.

3318
04:02:18,209 --> 04:02:23,360
Hold on.

3319
04:02:23,360 --> 04:02:24,719
I just, it's starting to hurt.

3320
04:02:27,159 --> 04:02:28,200
Let me, let me, hold on.

3321
04:02:28,200 --> 04:02:29,000
I'm not gonna say that yet.

3322
04:02:29,000 --> 04:02:29,879
Let me go get some,

3323
04:02:29,879 --> 04:02:31,479
like I'm gonna gargle some salt water

3324
04:02:31,479 --> 04:02:33,000
and like have a drink of water.

3325
04:02:33,000 --> 04:02:34,040
And let me just see how I am

3326
04:02:34,040 --> 04:02:34,760
in like two minutes.

3327
04:02:34,760 --> 04:02:35,959
I'll be right back.

3328
04:02:35,959 --> 04:02:44,360
And yes, regardless,

3329
04:02:44,360 --> 04:02:45,319
Sekiro is tomorrow.

3330
04:02:45,319 --> 04:02:46,120
Sekiro tomorrow.

3331
04:02:48,370 --> 04:02:49,010
Probably all day.

3332
04:02:50,290 --> 04:02:51,489
From the moment I get up,

3333
04:02:51,489 --> 04:02:53,090
I don't know when the stream's gonna start,

3334
04:02:53,090 --> 04:02:54,049
but I'm just gonna play

3335
04:02:54,049 --> 04:02:55,090
the absolute hell out of it.

3336
04:02:58,450 --> 04:02:59,090
So I'll be right back.

3337
04:02:59,090 --> 04:03:00,530
We'll just, we'll see in a second.

3338
04:03:00,530 --> 04:03:06,799
Too sick for Sekiro tomorrow, guaranteed.

3339
04:03:06,799 --> 04:03:07,440
No way.

3340
04:03:07,440 --> 04:03:09,280
I've been waiting too long to play this.

3341
04:03:09,280 --> 04:03:10,239
No, that's not gonna happen.

3342
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:12,479
I don't care if I have to mute myself.

3343
04:03:13,920 --> 04:03:15,760
It'll be like a no talking stream.

3344
04:03:15,760 --> 04:06:12,959
I'll be right back.

3345
04:06:12,959 --> 04:06:13,680
All right.

3346
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:15,489
Hooray.

3347
04:06:15,489 --> 04:06:18,559
Cough syrup is coming in.

3348
04:06:18,559 --> 04:06:19,200
Rejoicing.

3349
04:06:23,360 --> 04:06:26,000
But I am gonna just call it.

3350
04:06:26,000 --> 04:06:30,049
I was down there talking to Kim

3351
04:06:30,049 --> 04:06:31,409
and I've decided

3352
04:06:32,610 --> 04:06:35,170
it's probably for the best

3353
04:06:35,170 --> 04:06:37,010
because if I like keep going,

3354
04:06:37,010 --> 04:06:38,450
I keep talking and keep like

3355
04:06:40,129 --> 04:06:42,440
irritating the area that I did tomorrow.

3356
04:06:42,440 --> 04:06:44,120
Sekiro, you know what I'm saying?

3357
04:06:44,120 --> 04:06:45,559
Like I want to be fucking ready to go

3358
04:06:45,559 --> 04:06:47,079
completely all day.

3359
04:06:50,209 --> 04:06:51,170
Can you hear her?

3360
04:06:51,170 --> 04:06:53,760
Hold on.

3361
04:06:53,760 --> 04:06:54,479
She's coughing too.

3362
04:07:01,170 --> 04:07:01,889
Yeah.

3363
04:07:01,889 --> 04:07:03,170
She got it first.

3364
04:07:03,170 --> 04:07:04,129
She has it bad.

3365
04:07:04,129 --> 04:07:04,930
Mine's not that bad.

3366
04:07:04,930 --> 04:07:05,809
I hope it doesn't progress.

3367
04:07:05,809 --> 04:07:06,530
That'd be terrible.

3368
04:07:08,420 --> 04:07:10,579
But I'll be honest with you here.

3369
04:07:11,299 --> 04:07:12,760
This game is actually fucking fun.

3370
04:07:13,559 --> 04:07:15,479
And I would recommend that you play this game

3371
04:07:15,479 --> 04:07:16,280
if you think, you know,

3372
04:07:16,840 --> 04:07:19,799
if you like doing this kind of thing.

3373
04:07:20,360 --> 04:07:22,840
What a terrible, terrible review that I just gave.

3374
04:07:23,719 --> 04:07:25,000
It's good if you like this,

3375
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:26,520
if you kind of like this kind of thing.

3376
04:07:27,569 --> 04:07:27,809
Yeah.

3377
04:07:27,809 --> 04:07:28,290
No shit.

3378
04:07:30,440 --> 04:07:31,479
Italics is not sick.

3379
04:07:31,479 --> 04:07:32,760
I don't know how me and Kim got this.

3380
04:07:33,559 --> 04:07:35,010
I have no idea.

3381
04:07:35,569 --> 04:07:39,989
It's really only been the last couple of days though.

3382
04:07:44,049 --> 04:07:44,610
But yeah.

3383
04:07:44,610 --> 04:07:47,010
I'm gonna just get ready for Sekiro tomorrow.

3384
04:07:48,129 --> 04:07:49,649
I'm gonna do the thing that I should do.

3385
04:07:51,670 --> 04:07:52,870
And unfortunately,

3386
04:07:52,870 --> 04:07:54,629
we're gonna have like a four and a half hours stream.

3387
04:07:55,920 --> 04:07:56,559
But, and I'm sorry.

3388
04:07:56,559 --> 04:07:58,079
I haven't been gone for four days

3389
04:07:58,079 --> 04:08:00,719
for unrelated friend of mine came up.

3390
04:08:00,719 --> 04:08:02,879
And really the day coming back,

3391
04:08:02,879 --> 04:08:03,600
I don't want to be like,

3392
04:08:03,600 --> 04:08:05,120
see you later after like four hours.

3393
04:08:05,760 --> 04:08:07,479
But we are gonna go

3394
04:08:08,600 --> 04:08:10,280
probably Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

3395
04:08:10,920 --> 04:08:11,799
Because I'm just gonna,

3396
04:08:11,799 --> 04:08:13,399
obviously Sekiro is gonna be on the mind.

3397
04:08:15,559 --> 04:08:18,049
So with that, I'll see you tomorrow.

3398
04:08:18,049 --> 04:08:19,889
If you don't want Sekiro to be spoiled,

3399
04:08:20,770 --> 04:08:21,569
then by all means,

3400
04:08:22,370 --> 04:08:25,170
I'll just see you again when that's over with.

3401
04:08:26,069 --> 04:08:29,030
And later on in this coming week,

3402
04:08:29,750 --> 04:08:32,709
Monster Rancher 4 and probably Monster Rancher 2,

3403
04:08:32,709 --> 04:08:35,909
depending on how bad or good Monster Rancher 4 is.

3404
04:08:35,909 --> 04:08:37,299
I'll be going back to it.

3405
04:08:37,940 --> 04:08:39,219
So that's kind of the plan.

3406
04:08:40,209 --> 04:08:43,090
Maybe go back to VR a little after that.

3407
04:08:43,090 --> 04:08:43,590
Possibly.

3408
04:08:44,290 --> 04:08:51,510
So, so, I will see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.

3409
04:08:51,510 --> 04:08:54,000
I'm fucking insanely excited for it.

3410
04:08:54,719 --> 04:08:57,250
And again, sorry for the short stream tonight.

3411
04:08:57,809 --> 04:08:59,520
But I'm gonna rest up my voice.

3412
04:09:01,399 --> 04:09:02,440
And like I said,

3413
04:09:02,440 --> 04:09:04,680
of course the day coming back and having like,

3414
04:09:04,680 --> 04:09:06,600
oh, let me pick a game where I read,

3415
04:09:07,479 --> 04:09:10,930
where I'm gonna read a shit little dialogue.

3416
04:09:10,930 --> 04:09:17,639
What a, what a dope, you know what I mean?

3417
04:09:17,639 --> 04:09:19,079
Friday, yeah, the Sekiro,

3418
04:09:19,079 --> 04:09:21,879
Sekiro is technically out in like 30 or 40 minutes or something.

3419
04:09:21,879 --> 04:09:24,469
But I'm gonna wait till tomorrow.

3420
04:09:25,030 --> 04:09:27,090
Thank you so much.

3421
04:09:27,090 --> 04:09:31,719
Hope you enjoyed the time that we had here today.

3422
04:09:31,719 --> 04:09:33,719
I'll see you for Sekiro tomorrow.

3423
04:09:33,719 --> 04:09:34,760
Have a great one.

3424
04:09:37,280 --> 04:09:39,600
Catch you guys later.

3425
04:09:39,600 --> 04:09:41,540
And with that being said,

3426
04:09:42,819 --> 04:09:47,010
we are going to do the bits we pulled up.

3427
04:10:05,780 --> 04:10:11,079
Okay, so we have earlier today.

3428
04:10:17,239 --> 04:10:17,799
Out of the way.

3429
04:10:19,920 --> 04:10:25,750
Okay, so we had sad Vega for the 250.

3430
04:10:25,750 --> 04:10:26,629
Thank you, sad Vega.

3431
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:28,959
They say Sekiro tomorrow.

3432
04:10:28,959 --> 04:10:31,680
As you know, it's gonna be amazing, horrible time for you.

3433
04:10:31,680 --> 04:10:35,360
Sorry in advance for all the day one backseating you're gonna get.

3434
04:10:35,920 --> 04:10:39,280
I'm going to blitz that game tomorrow just to see all the shit you go through

3435
04:10:39,280 --> 04:10:44,079
and laugh gleefully like a shit goblin as you suffer what I suffered through.

3436
04:10:44,159 --> 04:10:45,360
I'll be rooting for you though 100%.

3437
04:10:46,159 --> 04:10:47,840
Also, your mother is coming up to visit.

3438
04:10:47,840 --> 04:10:49,520
Don't you mean down or left?

3439
04:10:50,079 --> 04:10:53,760
Because you're in Vegas, which I'm sure is southwest of Boston.

3440
04:10:56,159 --> 04:10:56,719
That's true.

3441
04:10:57,280 --> 04:10:57,520
Yes.

3442
04:10:58,639 --> 04:11:00,079
But I always say up no matter what.

3443
04:11:00,719 --> 04:11:02,799
Coming up somewhere, coming up somewhere, I always say up.

3444
04:11:03,840 --> 04:11:05,680
Coming down left just doesn't sound right.

3445
04:11:06,319 --> 04:11:09,139
But I'm looking forward to it.

3446
04:11:10,020 --> 04:11:12,149
Hey, how do you know you're gonna blow through it?

3447
04:11:12,149 --> 04:11:12,950
What if you get stuck?

3448
04:11:13,590 --> 04:11:14,469
It might happen.

3449
04:11:16,500 --> 04:11:18,420
Labo VR is out now.

3450
04:11:18,420 --> 04:11:19,139
The video is.

3451
04:11:20,840 --> 04:11:23,319
Yeah, I can look into that too when that's coming up.

3452
04:11:25,250 --> 04:11:26,129
Tutorial boss.

3453
04:11:26,129 --> 04:11:27,170
Maybe I'll get stuck on it.

3454
04:11:27,170 --> 04:11:27,649
I don't know.

3455
04:11:27,649 --> 04:11:28,450
I hope I do.

3456
04:11:29,750 --> 04:11:34,629
I hope I get like locked at an encounter for like 45 minutes to an hour or something.

3457
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:37,030
I miss that shit.

3458
04:11:37,030 --> 04:11:42,159
I miss not knowing what to do and it's a whole new experience.

3459
04:11:42,159 --> 04:11:42,719
I cannot wait.

3460
04:11:46,399 --> 04:11:48,239
Every death gift of one sub.

3461
04:11:48,239 --> 04:11:49,040
I'm not gonna do that.

3462
04:11:52,239 --> 04:11:53,360
Only an hour.

3463
04:11:55,010 --> 04:11:58,549
Yeah, it's possible.

3464
04:11:59,510 --> 04:12:00,069
But thank you.

3465
04:12:00,069 --> 04:12:02,469
Thank you Toshiro.TV for the five bucks.

3466
04:12:03,110 --> 04:12:06,469
I'm super excited for you to play Sekiro and I'm gonna be playing the heck out of it too.

3467
04:12:06,469 --> 04:12:08,790
But remember that there's not just dodging anymore.

3468
04:12:08,790 --> 04:12:10,229
It's gonna be weird to adjust.

3469
04:12:10,229 --> 04:12:12,309
But the posture system is really well designed.

3470
04:12:13,110 --> 04:12:15,110
Yeah, I've read some reviews about it.

3471
04:12:15,909 --> 04:12:19,989
And no, I thought there was one coming.

3472
04:12:19,989 --> 04:12:20,389
We're good.

3473
04:12:21,430 --> 04:12:26,690
Yeah, there's a whole system now on parries, right?

3474
04:12:26,690 --> 04:12:27,809
Not like there was before.

3475
04:12:27,809 --> 04:12:31,090
The parries are not the same throughout all the From Software games.

3476
04:12:32,309 --> 04:12:36,950
It's now there's an indicator and there's three different moves that you can do to block or parry.

3477
04:12:38,260 --> 04:12:39,620
It's not just like the,

3478
04:12:39,620 --> 04:12:40,100
DOOM!

3479
04:12:40,100 --> 04:12:40,819
Knock the thing up.

3480
04:12:40,819 --> 04:12:44,340
You have to actually do a certain maneuver, right?

3481
04:12:44,979 --> 04:12:48,100
Not just like hit left trigger, from my understanding.

3482
04:12:48,100 --> 04:12:49,940
And you get like a telegraph of when it's gonna happen.

3483
04:12:51,379 --> 04:12:52,500
So I don't know.

3484
04:12:55,620 --> 04:12:56,659
I'm so sorry.

3485
04:12:57,860 --> 04:12:58,500
I'm so sorry.

3486
04:12:58,500 --> 04:12:59,219
That was bad.

3487
04:13:00,020 --> 04:13:02,979
I'm sure a lot of people probably just like so sick of hearing this tonight.

3488
04:13:02,979 --> 04:13:06,819
Which is another reason why I'm like, it's probably for the best to stop.

3489
04:13:09,940 --> 04:13:10,659
So, sorry.

3490
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:15,239
He's dying.

3491
04:13:15,239 --> 04:13:18,100
No, I'm fine.

3492
04:13:18,100 --> 04:13:20,180
But yeah, there's a whole, there's like two health bars, right?

3493
04:13:20,180 --> 04:13:22,340
One of them is the posture system.

3494
04:13:22,340 --> 04:13:23,459
One of them is the health bar.

3495
04:13:23,459 --> 04:13:26,100
I'm sure it'll take a lot of getting used to, but that's, you know.

3496
04:13:26,100 --> 04:13:26,979
I'm looking forward to it.

3497
04:13:27,940 --> 04:13:29,920
Thank you.

3498
04:13:31,200 --> 04:13:31,600
Thank you.

3499
04:13:31,600 --> 04:13:33,280
WildFox1 for the three bucks.

3500
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:35,840
Dear Jeremiah, on behalf of your recommendation,

3501
04:13:35,840 --> 04:13:39,600
I have bought some metal straws and I can say it was a good buy.

3502
04:13:39,600 --> 04:13:40,399
So thanks for that.

3503
04:13:40,399 --> 04:13:44,229
Yeah, metal straws are awesome.

3504
04:13:45,620 --> 04:13:47,299
The liquid stays cold going through.

3505
04:13:48,629 --> 04:13:52,069
As for the question, I present each with each bit message.

3506
04:13:52,069 --> 04:13:56,229
Why the fuck did you let that globalist mutant frog out into the wild?

3507
04:13:56,229 --> 04:13:58,149
Do you want to watch the world burn?

3508
04:14:01,670 --> 04:14:03,909
Referencing Seaman, if you don't know.

3509
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:06,719
I had to see the credits.

3510
04:14:06,719 --> 04:14:07,600
That's my reasoning.

3511
04:14:09,430 --> 04:14:10,389
Thank you, though, WildFox.

3512
04:14:10,389 --> 04:14:11,590
Thank you, Jules, for the 250.

3513
04:14:11,590 --> 04:14:14,709
Have you thought about playing role-play games like GTA RP?

3514
04:14:14,709 --> 04:14:16,229
It's been getting a lot of attention recently.

3515
04:14:16,229 --> 04:14:17,190
I think you'd be good at it.

3516
04:14:17,829 --> 04:14:25,940
I think it would be a lot of fun, but I think I've, at least me personally,

3517
04:14:25,940 --> 04:14:32,120
I don't like to jump into random sessions with people that I don't know

3518
04:14:33,079 --> 04:14:36,200
because it's hard for me to bounce off of strangers.

3519
04:14:38,040 --> 04:14:42,680
If I get a few friends and we kind of all are in on the same jokes and the same material,

3520
04:14:43,559 --> 04:14:45,959
it's really easy to create scenarios and create fun.

3521
04:14:47,239 --> 04:14:51,559
But I don't really like to jump into just complete stranger scenarios

3522
04:14:51,559 --> 04:14:52,840
where somebody says something.

3523
04:14:52,840 --> 04:14:57,639
I mean, it would be fun, but it almost feels like, in a way for me,

3524
04:14:59,299 --> 04:15:03,139
when there's like a ton of people all kind of doing a bit at the same time,

3525
04:15:04,100 --> 04:15:08,840
it's hard to have your bit be a thing that you want to care about.

3526
04:15:08,840 --> 04:15:09,319
You know what I mean?

3527
04:15:11,120 --> 04:15:14,959
If you've got like 10 people all making something happen,

3528
04:15:15,600 --> 04:15:18,000
realistically, only a couple people can talk at once.

3529
04:15:18,799 --> 04:15:22,159
And what it ends up being, it ends up being one or two people's stories

3530
04:15:22,159 --> 04:15:24,719
that everybody else has to kind of find out how they're going to fit

3531
04:15:24,719 --> 04:15:26,479
into involved inside of it, right?

3532
04:15:27,840 --> 04:15:34,629
You could pretend to be a traveling salesman and pass through town

3533
04:15:34,629 --> 04:15:35,909
and only play for like a week.

3534
04:15:36,790 --> 04:15:42,629
Yeah, and don't a lot of the RP servers have pretty staunch rules

3535
04:15:42,629 --> 04:15:44,149
on what your character can do?

3536
04:15:46,149 --> 04:15:48,069
Isn't it like a commitment you really need to go in there

3537
04:15:48,069 --> 04:15:56,819
and follow like terms and you need to take improv classes?

3538
04:15:56,819 --> 04:16:01,360
No, it's just when there's so many people all doing the same thing.

3539
04:16:02,790 --> 04:16:06,229
Improv is improv, but when like 15 people are all doing improv

3540
04:16:06,229 --> 04:16:08,870
at the same time, it can just turn into noise.

3541
04:16:09,829 --> 04:16:10,950
That's what I'm saying.

3542
04:16:11,590 --> 04:16:18,440
That seems to happen with a lot of kind of,

3543
04:16:18,440 --> 04:16:21,079
it's almost like the scenario where, and this is,

3544
04:16:21,079 --> 04:16:25,889
this might sound like I'm talking shit or something, but I'm not.

3545
04:16:26,610 --> 04:16:32,120
But back in the day in YouTube, everybody was making a video, right?

3546
04:16:32,840 --> 04:16:36,200
So what would happen is if you got like five, six, seven people

3547
04:16:36,200 --> 04:16:40,760
that you're all new or you were kind of all going into a scenario with,

3548
04:16:41,479 --> 04:16:43,719
all of you were recording at the same time,

3549
04:16:44,600 --> 04:16:47,399
and all of you want to make the video,

3550
04:16:47,399 --> 04:16:50,040
and all of you want to make the joke.

3551
04:16:51,000 --> 04:16:52,600
So what ends up happening is just like,

3552
04:16:55,159 --> 04:16:56,520
it's almost incomprehensible.

3553
04:16:58,920 --> 04:17:01,079
Everybody's got their own intros,

3554
04:17:01,079 --> 04:17:02,520
everybody's got their own like characters,

3555
04:17:02,520 --> 04:17:04,680
everybody's got their own shit that they want to say

3556
04:17:04,680 --> 04:17:06,440
because they're making a video too,

3557
04:17:06,440 --> 04:17:10,440
they want to be the spotlight because their people are watching,

3558
04:17:10,440 --> 04:17:11,079
you know what I'm saying?

3559
04:17:15,649 --> 04:17:19,110
That's why it was always so much easier to, you know,

3560
04:17:19,110 --> 04:17:20,709
get like one or two people together,

3561
04:17:20,709 --> 04:17:24,709
and everybody knows kind of what we're going to do for this bit,

3562
04:17:24,709 --> 04:17:25,510
and where we're going to say,

3563
04:17:26,149 --> 04:17:27,110
how fun are we going to make it,

3564
04:17:27,110 --> 04:17:28,309
and what we're going to do this time.

3565
04:17:28,309 --> 04:17:30,469
And even if it was completely all off the cuff and improv,

3566
04:17:30,469 --> 04:17:31,909
which a lot of it was, most of it was,

3567
04:17:35,110 --> 04:17:37,510
30 main characters and no supporting cast.

3568
04:17:37,510 --> 04:17:38,229
Yeah, that's what I mean.

3569
04:17:38,950 --> 04:17:42,840
And that's not intended to like throw like shade at somebody,

3570
04:17:42,840 --> 04:17:46,600
it's just personally I don't do well in an environment

3571
04:17:46,600 --> 04:17:50,120
where everybody's all trying to make a joke at the same time,

3572
04:17:50,920 --> 04:17:52,920
because everybody has their camera pointed at them.

3573
04:17:53,799 --> 04:18:03,879
You can hang out with only one or two people,

3574
04:18:03,879 --> 04:18:06,040
lots of streamers have just broken up into gangs.

3575
04:18:07,909 --> 04:18:09,350
I mean, I don't know anything about it.

3576
04:18:09,909 --> 04:18:13,030
All I know is that it's really, really popular right now,

3577
04:18:13,030 --> 04:18:14,950
and anytime you jump into something really popular,

3578
04:18:14,950 --> 04:18:16,069
you kind of, it's kind of inevitable

3579
04:18:16,069 --> 04:18:17,670
that you're going to just get landed somewhere,

3580
04:18:17,670 --> 04:18:20,389
and all right, where's the camera pointing,

3581
04:18:20,389 --> 04:18:21,350
and where are we going, right?

3582
04:18:29,559 --> 04:18:32,360
And that's not me talking specifically about GTA RP,

3583
04:18:32,360 --> 04:18:40,149
that's just talking about the nature of kind of online playing

3584
04:18:40,149 --> 04:18:43,510
or making a video or streaming with a bunch of other people

3585
04:18:43,510 --> 04:18:44,629
that are all doing the same thing.

3586
04:18:56,610 --> 04:19:00,079
But it's not something that I think it would be a lot of fun,

3587
04:19:00,079 --> 04:19:02,479
it's just I'm not sure exactly even where to start

3588
04:19:02,479 --> 04:19:03,200
with something like that.

3589
04:19:04,899 --> 04:19:06,659
Because I really would just be like every,

3590
04:19:06,659 --> 04:19:09,459
like you said, people break off into like gangs and stuff,

3591
04:19:09,459 --> 04:19:12,659
and I would just be the one dickhead walking around,

3592
04:19:12,659 --> 04:19:16,420
like I said, trying to find the content to be a part of.

3593
04:19:17,540 --> 04:19:20,149
Oh, we got like these like five guys are doing this,

3594
04:19:20,149 --> 04:19:21,750
these like four or five people are doing this,

3595
04:19:21,750 --> 04:19:23,829
and I'm just like, hey, I just joined.

3596
04:19:27,190 --> 04:19:30,629
Alert, alert, it's me, alert, I'm here, alert.

3597
04:19:30,629 --> 04:19:32,229
Like, I don't even know where to start.

3598
04:19:41,190 --> 04:19:45,219
But anyways, hopefully that kind of answers the question of

3599
04:19:46,239 --> 04:19:51,360
why I don't typically do RP based stuff on stream or on video.

3600
04:19:52,159 --> 04:19:53,600
Especially people that I don't know.

3601
04:19:53,600 --> 04:19:55,520
That's the number one reason.

3602
04:19:56,239 --> 04:19:58,319
Number one is with people that I don't know, right?

3603
04:19:58,319 --> 04:20:02,370
But thank you for the 250.

3604
04:20:02,370 --> 04:20:03,969
Thank you Mad for the $5.

3605
04:20:04,690 --> 04:20:06,719
Hey, Jerma, hope all is well.

3606
04:20:06,719 --> 04:20:08,479
I'm heading to Boston on Saturday for college,

3607
04:20:08,479 --> 04:20:10,959
so I might not be able to see some of your streams, but hey.

3608
04:20:12,440 --> 04:20:14,520
Well, welcome to Boston.

3609
04:20:20,360 --> 04:20:22,520
Boston is a wonderful city.

3610
04:20:23,319 --> 04:20:23,819
Enjoy it.

3611
04:20:26,659 --> 04:20:28,100
Going to college in Boston is that,

3612
04:20:28,899 --> 04:20:32,180
that's, I don't know if it's a new thing

3613
04:20:32,180 --> 04:20:35,379
or something you've been doing already, but good luck.

3614
04:20:36,100 --> 04:20:43,399
And I don't know how far away you are, but hope you enjoy it.

3615
04:20:44,040 --> 04:20:49,620
All the people I work with from there are pretty straightforward.

3616
04:20:51,250 --> 04:20:55,670
Yeah, I mean, Boston is kind of one of those cities

3617
04:20:55,670 --> 04:20:57,909
where it's just, who are you?

3618
04:20:57,909 --> 04:20:58,469
What do you want?

3619
04:20:59,030 --> 04:21:01,350
And how do I get it to you as fast as possible?

3620
04:21:01,350 --> 04:21:02,229
So you leave me alone.

3621
04:21:02,870 --> 04:21:05,590
That's like a lot of like Boston.

3622
04:21:05,590 --> 04:21:06,469
Who are you?

3623
04:21:06,469 --> 04:21:07,430
Oh, my name is Jeremy.

3624
04:21:07,430 --> 04:21:08,149
Okay, what do you want?

3625
04:21:09,270 --> 04:21:10,790
I want a sandwich.

3626
04:21:10,790 --> 04:21:11,670
All right, here, here you go.

3627
04:21:11,670 --> 04:21:12,870
It's done already.

3628
04:21:12,870 --> 04:21:13,909
I didn't even order.

3629
04:21:13,909 --> 04:21:14,790
Are you sure you didn't?

3630
04:21:15,350 --> 04:21:16,950
And then they bring the order that I was going to order.

3631
04:21:17,670 --> 04:21:19,909
I, that's what I thought.

3632
04:21:19,909 --> 04:21:20,790
Okay, thank you.

3633
04:21:20,790 --> 04:21:21,590
Bye.

3634
04:21:21,590 --> 04:21:30,229
Thank you Tingy for the 250.

3635
04:21:30,790 --> 04:21:34,239
Jerma, I don't think I could wear your shirts in public anymore.

3636
04:21:35,120 --> 04:21:35,520
Why not?

3637
04:21:35,520 --> 04:21:36,639
Over the weekend I was out

3638
04:21:36,639 --> 04:21:38,959
and someone saw me wearing my night sky shirt

3639
04:21:38,959 --> 04:21:40,399
and it must have angered them.

3640
04:21:41,360 --> 04:21:43,040
He pointed at me and starts yelling

3641
04:21:43,040 --> 04:21:44,959
shpee compact streamer another weird thing.

3642
04:21:48,469 --> 04:21:49,670
This is bullshit is what you're saying.

3643
04:21:50,309 --> 04:21:51,250
It's a great shirt.

3644
04:21:51,250 --> 04:21:51,729
You should wear it.

3645
04:21:52,450 --> 04:21:53,889
Thank you though.

3646
04:21:54,450 --> 04:21:56,559
I'm going to like turn my mic fucking down.

3647
04:21:58,799 --> 04:22:00,159
I hate being a coughing.

3648
04:22:03,379 --> 04:22:03,860
It's all right.

3649
04:22:06,559 --> 04:22:08,719
Thank you for the 20 bucks earlier.

3650
04:22:09,440 --> 04:22:09,760
Thank you.

3651
04:22:11,840 --> 04:22:13,360
Jeremy the Jerm, the big Jerm.

3652
04:22:13,920 --> 04:22:14,719
I have a request.

3653
04:22:14,719 --> 04:22:18,719
My dearest friend Haley is having a birthday bash and I need you.

3654
04:22:19,360 --> 04:22:19,600
Okay.

3655
04:22:20,479 --> 04:22:22,870
Her favorite hunk o' man.

3656
04:22:23,909 --> 04:22:28,309
I need you, her favorite hunk o' man

3657
04:22:28,309 --> 04:22:30,870
to wish upon her the happiest birthday

3658
04:22:30,870 --> 04:22:33,750
you've ever wished upon anyone upon reading this.

3659
04:22:34,790 --> 04:22:36,790
I need you to go hard on this one for me.

3660
04:22:36,790 --> 04:22:37,590
As hard as you can.

3661
04:22:38,229 --> 04:22:39,750
Possibly get for 20 dollars.

3662
04:22:42,790 --> 04:22:43,430
Well, all right.

3663
04:22:43,989 --> 04:22:45,719
Somebody clip this.

3664
04:22:45,719 --> 04:22:47,159
Don't get this first part though.

3665
04:22:47,799 --> 04:22:52,760
Haley.

3666
04:22:52,840 --> 04:22:53,700
Hold on.

3667
04:22:53,700 --> 04:22:54,739
No, no, not this part.

3668
04:22:54,739 --> 04:22:55,459
Starting now.

3669
04:22:59,120 --> 04:22:59,520
Haley.

3670
04:23:00,799 --> 04:23:01,920
Happy birthday.

3671
04:23:01,920 --> 04:23:03,729
Just want to make that very clear.

3672
04:23:04,290 --> 04:23:06,290
Hope you have a wonderful birthday, Haley.

3673
04:23:08,180 --> 04:23:10,180
I don't know what your last name is

3674
04:23:10,979 --> 04:23:12,100
but I just know you're Haley

3675
04:23:12,100 --> 04:23:14,659
and I know that you're going to have a great fucking birthday.

3676
04:23:14,659 --> 04:23:15,299
You know why?

3677
04:23:15,860 --> 04:23:20,149
Because I just deemed it necessary.

3678
04:23:20,149 --> 04:23:20,790
I want one.

3679
04:23:20,790 --> 04:23:21,989
Is that somebody somebody right there?

3680
04:23:21,989 --> 04:23:24,790
I want you to load up the crowd right now.

3681
04:23:24,790 --> 04:23:26,870
There's at least 400 people at your party.

3682
04:23:26,870 --> 04:23:28,549
Look at one, two, three, four, five.

3683
04:23:28,549 --> 04:23:29,350
Stop blowing the horns.

3684
04:23:29,989 --> 04:23:31,250
Put on the party hats.

3685
04:23:31,889 --> 04:23:33,350
Get the ice cream out.

3686
04:23:33,350 --> 04:23:34,879
Because it's your birthday.

3687
04:23:34,879 --> 04:23:37,120
And everybody on earth should be celebrating.

3688
04:23:37,120 --> 04:23:39,040
I want this to be broadcast on fucking TV.

3689
04:23:40,719 --> 04:23:41,600
And it will be.

3690
04:23:41,600 --> 04:23:44,719
I'm going to spend the 645,000 dollars it takes

3691
04:23:44,719 --> 04:23:47,200
to put this and put it on every station.

3692
04:23:47,920 --> 04:23:54,659
Happy birthday.

3693
04:23:54,659 --> 04:23:58,239
And tune into like MTV in a week

3694
04:23:58,239 --> 04:24:00,959
and when I pay Viacom, that's a lie.

3695
04:24:00,959 --> 04:24:02,000
But happy birthday, Haley.

3696
04:24:02,639 --> 04:24:04,260
Hope you have a great day.

3697
04:24:04,819 --> 04:24:10,680
Of course, you got friends.

3698
04:24:11,319 --> 04:24:12,840
You got all kinds of friends that care about you.

3699
04:24:12,840 --> 04:24:13,319
That's good.

3700
04:24:16,200 --> 04:24:17,239
Looking out for you, you know?

3701
04:24:17,959 --> 04:24:18,840
Happy birthday.

3702
04:24:21,270 --> 04:24:24,579
Hey, Professor Breen.

3703
04:24:24,579 --> 04:24:25,940
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

3704
04:24:25,940 --> 04:24:26,500
And that's it.

3705
04:24:27,299 --> 04:24:29,430
Thank you so much, Professor Breen.

3706
04:24:29,989 --> 04:24:32,319
No message.

3707
04:24:32,319 --> 04:24:33,600
Just 10 dollars.

3708
04:24:33,600 --> 04:24:34,000
Thank you.

3709
04:24:36,530 --> 04:24:38,610
Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the 250.

3710
04:24:38,610 --> 04:24:40,690
All these characters in the hierarchy are real.

3711
04:24:41,409 --> 04:24:43,729
Jacques-Louis David was a world-renowned artist

3712
04:24:43,729 --> 04:24:45,569
who operated during the revolution.

3713
04:24:45,569 --> 04:24:47,409
He made some of the most famous art pieces

3714
04:24:47,409 --> 04:24:49,170
of the period like this one.

3715
04:24:52,200 --> 04:24:55,920
Oh, this is Jacques-Louis David, Bonaparte,

3716
04:24:56,479 --> 04:24:58,639
Francis Le Grand, St. Bernard.

3717
04:24:59,280 --> 04:25:00,850
Google Art.

3718
04:25:00,850 --> 04:25:02,149
Okay.

3719
04:25:02,149 --> 04:25:06,200
Oh, he made this?

3720
04:25:14,450 --> 04:25:17,250
That's the guy who made the famous

3721
04:25:17,250 --> 04:25:19,559
rearing Napoleon painting.

3722
04:25:19,559 --> 04:25:20,520
That's cool.

3723
04:25:20,520 --> 04:25:22,209
Didn't know that.

3724
04:25:22,209 --> 04:25:23,329
It's a very educational game.

3725
04:25:23,969 --> 04:25:26,260
Thank you, Smelly Boy.

3726
04:25:28,610 --> 04:25:30,049
Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.

3727
04:25:30,049 --> 04:25:33,250
You say 10 straight hours as if it's an amazing feat.

3728
04:25:33,250 --> 04:25:35,250
But at this point, nine or 10 hour streams

3729
04:25:35,250 --> 04:25:37,969
are common for you when you got to read bits for hours.

3730
04:25:39,250 --> 04:25:42,290
Yeah, but that hasn't happened that very recently, no.

3731
04:25:44,200 --> 04:25:47,159
All the streams recently since that the 250 change.

3732
04:25:48,879 --> 04:25:50,639
The end of the streams have not been that long.

3733
04:25:52,000 --> 04:25:54,239
They've been maybe 30 to 40 minutes each.

3734
04:25:56,129 --> 04:25:56,690
Not anymore.

3735
04:25:57,329 --> 04:26:01,040
A nine to 10 hour stream is really like

3736
04:26:01,040 --> 04:26:04,879
has been recently a nine, an eight to nine plus hour stream.

3737
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:14,420
Remember when he only streamed for like three or four hours?

3738
04:26:15,299 --> 04:26:17,540
Yeah, I do.

3739
04:26:18,260 --> 04:26:24,930
A few years ago.

3740
04:26:24,930 --> 04:26:26,610
A couple years ago is really what it was.

3741
04:26:27,719 --> 04:26:30,760
A five, a four to five hour stream like two or three years ago was

3742
04:26:32,530 --> 04:26:33,809
that was a long stream for me.

3743
04:26:36,520 --> 04:26:38,950
But also I was so not used to that.

3744
04:26:38,950 --> 04:26:39,670
That's another thing.

3745
04:26:40,950 --> 04:26:42,629
Remember, I was making YouTube videos.

3746
04:26:43,190 --> 04:26:46,870
I wasn't just broadcasting straight for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine hours.

3747
04:26:47,750 --> 04:26:53,299
It took a long time really for me to really understand how to

3748
04:26:54,260 --> 04:27:01,809
limit myself energy wise and because what I would I would just blow out for like an hour or two.

3749
04:27:01,809 --> 04:27:03,010
And sometimes I still do that.

3750
04:27:03,889 --> 04:27:07,809
But sometimes I'll just blow out for two or three straight hours and then just be exhausted.

3751
04:27:08,530 --> 04:27:13,440
But I've learned sort of how to keep my energy levels up

3752
04:27:14,239 --> 04:27:16,799
to a point where I'm not just blown out after three hours.

3753
04:27:29,360 --> 04:27:31,680
Somebody said Vinny streams are like three hours max,

3754
04:27:32,239 --> 04:27:33,840
but he also streams almost every day.

3755
04:27:34,799 --> 04:27:36,479
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ways to do it.

3756
04:27:36,959 --> 04:27:40,559
There's a lot of ways to I know there are people aren't the people that

3757
04:27:40,559 --> 04:27:44,159
will stream for like three, two or three hours and then they'll take a break

3758
04:27:44,159 --> 04:27:46,559
and then come back in the night time and do another three or four hours.

3759
04:27:47,520 --> 04:27:48,239
People do that.

3760
04:27:57,190 --> 04:27:59,030
So, I mean, everybody is different.

3761
04:28:00,120 --> 04:28:07,520
And I've found over the years that if, you know, I give myself a day or two off,

3762
04:28:07,520 --> 04:28:10,000
a couple days off here or there, once a, you know, once a week,

3763
04:28:10,000 --> 04:28:11,120
take like two or three days off,

3764
04:28:12,079 --> 04:28:17,120
then I can usually sit here for more than five to six, maybe sometimes 10 hours.

3765
04:28:17,760 --> 04:28:19,600
It's taken me a long time to figure out how to do that

3766
04:28:20,319 --> 04:28:21,969
and be comfortable doing it.

3767
04:28:24,770 --> 04:28:26,610
Stream for five minutes every half hour.

3768
04:28:27,969 --> 04:28:29,489
You would get unfollowed in a second.

3769
04:28:30,370 --> 04:28:34,840
But thank you, Dorkcube for the 250.

3770
04:28:34,840 --> 04:28:36,440
You say 10 hours straight.

3771
04:28:36,440 --> 04:28:37,319
That was Dorkcube.

3772
04:28:37,319 --> 04:28:46,239
I don't even know if I said your name, but thank you.

3773
04:28:48,579 --> 04:28:49,620
Yeah, CoreMonster.

3774
04:28:50,340 --> 04:28:54,659
CoreMonster gave a hundred dollars, a hundred dollars and two cents.

3775
04:28:57,540 --> 04:28:58,500
Thank you, CoreMonster.

3776
04:28:59,969 --> 04:29:01,010
It's a shitload of money.

3777
04:29:01,010 --> 04:29:03,090
We touched upon it already, but it's fucking a lot.

3778
04:29:03,090 --> 04:29:03,489
Thank you.

3779
04:29:10,549 --> 04:29:11,190
Yeah, nothing.

3780
04:29:11,190 --> 04:29:12,549
I don't have any other issues though.

3781
04:29:13,840 --> 04:29:16,319
I don't have, you know, my head doesn't hurt.

3782
04:29:16,319 --> 04:29:17,520
I don't have a stuffy nose.

3783
04:29:18,870 --> 04:29:22,549
I just have this irritated throat and like an annoying

3784
04:29:23,430 --> 04:29:25,670
cough that originates down here in my chest somewhere.

3785
04:29:26,549 --> 04:29:28,709
So here's the shitty part about that.

3786
04:29:30,209 --> 04:29:32,290
If I, if this doesn't go away in a few days,

3787
04:29:32,290 --> 04:29:33,809
I'm probably going to have to go to the doctor

3788
04:29:33,809 --> 04:29:36,930
because like chest cough is, you don't, you want to take care of that.

3789
04:29:37,969 --> 04:29:48,280
So it's just like throat down into the down here.

3790
04:29:51,329 --> 04:29:52,850
But I'm fine.

3791
04:29:52,850 --> 04:29:53,969
I just have a cough.

3792
04:29:53,969 --> 04:29:55,329
It's not a problem.

3793
04:29:55,329 --> 04:29:57,110
And if it becomes an issue, I'll take care of it.

3794
04:29:57,110 --> 04:29:57,989
That's all there is to it.

3795
04:30:01,840 --> 04:30:02,399
No shirt.

3796
04:30:02,399 --> 04:30:05,280
Yeah, I just proved to everybody that I don't have a shirt on.

3797
04:30:05,920 --> 04:30:07,719
That's all it took.

3798
04:30:09,079 --> 04:30:10,280
I love how somebody just said that.

3799
04:30:11,159 --> 04:30:11,879
No shirt.

3800
04:30:13,649 --> 04:30:13,889
No.

3801
04:30:17,239 --> 04:30:19,479
Nintendo tried to sue you recently.

3802
04:30:19,479 --> 04:30:21,159
Who fucking made up that bullshit?

3803
04:30:22,760 --> 04:30:24,200
Nintendo tried to sue me?

3804
04:30:28,870 --> 04:30:29,989
Give me a source on that.

3805
04:30:32,680 --> 04:30:35,799
Hey blue comet, thanks for the $23 blue comet.

3806
04:30:35,799 --> 04:30:37,040
Here's some bits, Jerma.

3807
04:30:37,040 --> 04:30:39,040
Thanks for being so entertaining and funny, Jerma Hart.

3808
04:30:39,680 --> 04:30:42,319
Thanks for paying me a shitload of money

3809
04:30:42,319 --> 04:30:44,319
and watching the stream and being part of the community.

3810
04:30:44,319 --> 04:30:44,639
Thank you.

3811
04:30:49,620 --> 04:30:51,200
That means an absolute fuck time.

3812
04:30:51,200 --> 04:30:51,840
Thank you so much.

3813
04:30:54,659 --> 04:30:56,020
Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 10 bucks.

3814
04:30:56,020 --> 04:30:56,659
Have some bits.

3815
04:30:56,659 --> 04:30:58,020
You deserve it, girlfriend.

3816
04:30:58,659 --> 04:31:00,020
Thank you, Dr. Pepper.

3817
04:31:00,020 --> 04:31:01,379
For the $10.

3818
04:31:06,049 --> 04:31:06,850
Really appreciate it.

3819
04:31:07,489 --> 04:31:11,700
I'm honored that you think I deserve your money.

3820
04:31:12,260 --> 04:31:14,770
Did I talk to Skrillex yet?

3821
04:31:14,770 --> 04:31:15,270
No.

3822
04:31:15,969 --> 04:31:18,549
No, I did not.

3823
04:31:19,989 --> 04:31:21,590
Hey man boy, thanks for the $250.

3824
04:31:21,590 --> 04:31:25,030
Hey Jerma, Nintendo tweeted out a video showcasing Labo VR.

3825
04:31:25,030 --> 04:31:26,389
It's seven minutes long.

3826
04:31:27,030 --> 04:31:28,549
So you should watch it on your own time.

3827
04:31:28,549 --> 04:31:30,549
Too bad it probably won't be good for streaming.

3828
04:31:31,829 --> 04:31:35,520
That's what everybody said about the other Labo streams,

3829
04:31:35,520 --> 04:31:37,280
but that's not going to stop me from streaming it.

3830
04:31:40,079 --> 04:31:42,239
I'm going to stream Labo VR.

3831
04:31:43,040 --> 04:31:44,610
That is a promise.

3832
04:31:45,809 --> 04:31:46,770
Why would I not do that?

3833
04:31:47,409 --> 04:31:53,700
You have to put the switch on your head.

3834
04:31:54,420 --> 04:31:56,180
Well, it's switch on head or pre-recorded.

3835
04:31:56,180 --> 04:31:56,979
I can make that joke.

3836
04:31:57,860 --> 04:32:01,000
Don't clip that or anything.

3837
04:32:01,000 --> 04:32:02,760
I want to be able to say that on that stream.

3838
04:32:03,319 --> 04:32:07,040
But thank you, man boy, for your $250 again.

3839
04:32:07,040 --> 04:32:08,239
They forgot to link.

3840
04:32:08,239 --> 04:32:11,059
I will definitely take a look at this.

3841
04:32:11,059 --> 04:32:12,500
But thank you for the $5, man boy.

3842
04:32:14,340 --> 04:32:16,180
And then Dorkcube, thanks for the $250.

3843
04:32:16,180 --> 04:32:16,979
Get well soon, friend.

3844
04:32:16,979 --> 04:32:19,059
I can't wait to see you play Sekiro tomorrow

3845
04:32:19,059 --> 04:32:21,379
and die to this game's version of Pinwheel.

3846
04:32:22,340 --> 04:32:23,940
Now, but nobody knows who that version is.

3847
04:32:23,940 --> 04:32:25,459
Nobody knows anything about Pinwheel.

3848
04:32:28,559 --> 04:32:29,840
I don't know and you don't know.

3849
04:32:29,840 --> 04:32:32,159
So even if I do die to Pinwheel tomorrow,

3850
04:32:32,159 --> 04:32:34,239
you're not going to know that for like another couple of weeks

3851
04:32:34,239 --> 04:32:34,959
and then you'll forget.

3852
04:32:39,520 --> 04:32:51,459
Repaired joke.

3853
04:32:51,540 --> 04:32:52,340
Somebody just clipped it.

3854
04:32:52,340 --> 04:32:53,620
I just told you not to.

3855
04:32:54,260 --> 04:32:56,209
Oh my God, he did the thing.

3856
04:32:58,290 --> 04:33:01,459
Oh, switch on head.

3857
04:33:03,670 --> 04:33:04,470
Oh my goodness.

3858
04:33:06,020 --> 04:33:08,959
All right, let's roll the credits.

3859
04:33:14,279 --> 04:33:16,680
Let's see the subs and resubs tonight.

3860
04:33:18,450 --> 04:33:20,439
A lot, a lot.

3861
04:33:20,439 --> 04:33:22,040
A lot of people subbed and resubbed today

3862
04:33:23,400 --> 04:33:24,279
and gone for a while.

3863
04:33:24,279 --> 04:33:25,240
So thank you, guys.

3864
04:33:25,880 --> 04:33:29,599
German with the credits music.

3865
04:33:29,599 --> 04:33:33,750
What? The music's on?

3866
04:33:33,750 --> 04:33:37,490
What's your opinion of the French Revolution?

3867
04:33:39,299 --> 04:33:39,779
It happened.

3868
04:33:40,419 --> 04:33:46,099
Started watching your Stardew stream while working and it's cozy.

3869
04:33:47,599 --> 04:33:50,659
Yeah, that's a cozy game.

3870
04:33:51,540 --> 04:33:55,240
I can't wait to check out that multiplayer, right?

3871
04:33:55,240 --> 04:34:02,849
What's that burger restaurant in Vegas called?

3872
04:34:02,849 --> 04:34:03,810
They're going to be in Vegas tomorrow.

3873
04:34:03,810 --> 04:34:05,330
I want to go to their hash house at Gogo.

3874
04:34:07,509 --> 04:34:08,389
It's at the link.

3875
04:34:10,049 --> 04:34:11,810
You can, you can put the stamp of it.

3876
04:34:11,810 --> 04:34:13,729
You can wear a t-shirt that says,

3877
04:34:13,729 --> 04:34:16,930
German985 said this was the best restaurant in Las Vegas.

3878
04:34:19,009 --> 04:34:22,689
The burger from, they do a stuffed burger.

3879
04:34:23,409 --> 04:34:27,029
They do, it's a specialty from hash house at Gogo in the link.

3880
04:34:28,069 --> 04:34:31,349
Is probably the best fucking restaurant in Las Vegas.

3881
04:34:32,549 --> 04:34:33,459
There it is.

3882
04:34:44,419 --> 04:34:44,979
Sponsor.

3883
04:34:44,979 --> 04:34:45,779
Nope.

3884
04:34:45,779 --> 04:34:47,220
They just got the best burger in town.

3885
04:34:47,939 --> 04:34:51,189
Did you really die to pinwheel?

3886
04:34:51,189 --> 04:34:51,430
No.

3887
04:34:52,580 --> 04:34:54,740
That is a, what they call a funny joke

3888
04:34:55,459 --> 04:34:58,360
that the community has kept going,

3889
04:34:59,919 --> 04:35:03,119
you know, to crawl under my skin and say it and I get really angry

3890
04:35:03,119 --> 04:35:04,479
and I say, yeah, I didn't do that.

3891
04:35:05,279 --> 04:35:12,049
Never had the Gordon Ramsay burger.

3892
04:35:12,049 --> 04:35:15,490
I've been to Gordon Ramsay's steak, which was incredible.

3893
04:35:16,290 --> 04:35:21,599
That's the thing about Vegas.

3894
04:35:22,799 --> 04:35:27,360
There are hundreds and hundreds of amazing restaurants.

3895
04:35:27,360 --> 04:35:28,560
You kind of just have to pick one.

3896
04:35:29,119 --> 04:35:34,709
This is the guy that beat, yeah.

3897
04:35:34,709 --> 04:35:35,270
So, all right.

3898
04:35:35,270 --> 04:35:37,270
So I, I beat flame lurker first try.

3899
04:35:39,380 --> 04:35:40,740
Let's go over this real quick.

3900
04:35:40,740 --> 04:35:42,500
Flame lurker first try from Demon's Souls.

3901
04:35:43,220 --> 04:35:43,619
Blind.

3902
04:35:45,040 --> 04:35:47,919
We got champion gun deer first try.

3903
04:35:47,919 --> 04:35:48,959
Dancer first try.

3904
04:35:49,680 --> 04:35:50,479
Who else?

3905
04:35:50,479 --> 04:35:52,240
Because I want people to understand that

3906
04:35:52,240 --> 04:35:53,840
that's going to happen over the next couple of days.

3907
04:35:53,840 --> 04:35:56,240
I'm going to first try a hard boss over the next few days

3908
04:35:57,490 --> 04:35:59,830
and everybody is going to remember it.

3909
04:35:59,830 --> 04:36:01,430
God, I'm going to make sure I talk about just as much

3910
04:36:01,430 --> 04:36:02,310
I talk about the other ones.

3911
04:36:03,189 --> 04:36:07,639
Well, no, Jevil's not from software related.

3912
04:36:07,639 --> 04:36:08,680
I'm talking from software here.

3913
04:36:12,389 --> 04:36:13,509
Gwyn first try too.

3914
04:36:13,509 --> 04:36:13,750
Yeah.

3915
04:36:14,470 --> 04:36:21,439
Any new stream starting soon or BRB overcards

3916
04:36:21,439 --> 04:36:22,799
you mentioned sometime before you're going to be?

3917
04:36:22,799 --> 04:36:23,360
Yeah, oh yeah.

3918
04:36:24,319 --> 04:36:27,720
I've just been away from the computer

3919
04:36:27,720 --> 04:36:30,759
so I haven't really had a chance to get in touch with Blordel.

3920
04:36:31,080 --> 04:36:32,439
But it's going to happen.

3921
04:36:33,720 --> 04:36:35,479
I've been not here for about a week so.

3922
04:36:38,360 --> 04:36:41,000
Are socks feet gloves or are gloves hand socks?

3923
04:36:43,139 --> 04:36:44,659
They're made out of like cotton.

3924
04:36:44,659 --> 04:36:45,380
That's it.

3925
04:36:45,380 --> 04:36:46,099
They could go anywhere.

3926
04:36:46,099 --> 04:36:49,619
You can put cotton like on your penis

3927
04:36:50,840 --> 04:36:52,040
and it's just cotton.

3928
04:36:53,159 --> 04:36:54,790
I don't know why I said that

3929
04:36:54,790 --> 04:36:56,790
but that's pretty much where we're going to end.

3930
04:36:59,569 --> 04:37:00,930
Thanks for watching everybody.

3931
04:37:00,930 --> 04:37:01,409
See you soon.

3932
04:37:01,409 --> 04:37:01,970
See you tomorrow.

3933
04:37:08,099 --> 04:37:11,540
Are you going to make any more E-Bots?

3934
04:37:11,540 --> 04:37:12,259
Uh, yes.

3935
04:37:15,159 --> 04:37:17,319
Like that one, I don't know why that was the first.

3936
04:37:17,319 --> 04:37:18,360
I could have said like fingers

3937
04:37:18,360 --> 04:37:19,319
but that would just be gloves.

3938
04:37:20,200 --> 04:37:23,729
Anywho, I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.

3939
04:37:25,639 --> 04:37:26,520
Yeah, I ended early.

3940
04:37:26,520 --> 04:37:27,720
Who's streaming right now?

3941
04:37:27,720 --> 04:37:29,409
We got any streamers right now?

3942
04:37:30,130 --> 04:37:35,459
Okay, we've got who's live?

3943
04:37:35,459 --> 04:37:35,939
I don't know.

3944
04:37:35,939 --> 04:37:37,060
Why is it taking so long to load?

3945
04:37:39,110 --> 04:37:42,979
Let's run on Twitch.

3946
04:37:44,099 --> 04:37:45,080
Twitch, what are you doing?

3947
04:37:47,990 --> 04:37:50,369
What the hell was that?

3948
04:37:51,009 --> 04:37:51,970
Does it lose internet?

3949
04:37:54,040 --> 04:37:54,759
All right, we got...

3950
04:37:56,200 --> 04:37:57,720
What are people playing?

3951
04:38:05,720 --> 04:38:07,000
Vinny's playing Devil May Cry.

3952
04:38:08,740 --> 04:38:11,700
Joel's playing a game called Bad Smell.

3953
04:38:11,700 --> 04:38:12,580
What the fuck is that?

3954
04:38:14,689 --> 04:38:15,729
Nova's just hanging out.

3955
04:38:17,490 --> 04:38:20,369
Kiwo is playing, doing GTRP I assume.

3956
04:38:21,090 --> 04:38:31,009
Kraken's playing Sekiro.

3957
04:38:31,009 --> 04:38:32,130
Well, then we don't want to rate him

3958
04:38:32,130 --> 04:38:34,450
because I want you to watch my Sekiro stream.

3959
04:38:38,659 --> 04:38:44,209
Uh, yeah, let's rate Kiwo.

3960
04:38:44,849 --> 04:38:49,590
We rated Kraken a few days ago

3961
04:38:49,590 --> 04:38:51,669
and we rated Vinny like a few days before that.

3962
04:38:51,669 --> 04:38:52,389
Let's rate Kiwo.

3963
04:38:53,189 --> 04:38:53,830
Go say hello.

3964
04:38:54,630 --> 04:38:58,020
And I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.

3965
04:38:58,580 --> 04:39:01,639
Have a great one.

3966
04:39:01,639 --> 04:39:07,299
Go to my channel page here.

3967
04:39:07,939 --> 04:39:12,279
So here we go.

3968
04:39:13,000 --> 04:39:15,110
Bingo.

3969
04:39:16,900 --> 04:39:18,500
Ready to raid GTRP.

3970
04:39:18,500 --> 04:39:19,139
Hope you enjoy it.

3971
04:39:23,159 --> 04:39:24,439
You don't know who that is.

3972
04:39:24,439 --> 04:39:26,200
She's a very funny, talented person.

3973
04:39:26,840 --> 04:39:29,779
Go say hello.

3974
04:39:31,599 --> 04:39:32,240
Take care, guys.

3975
04:39:32,880 --> 04:39:33,939
See you tomorrow.

3976
04:39:33,939 --> 04:39:38,549
Oh, I missed right at the end here.

3977
04:39:38,549 --> 04:39:39,909
Hey, bath bath, five bucks.

3978
04:39:39,909 --> 04:39:40,790
Thanks for the five bucks.

3979
04:39:41,430 --> 04:39:42,790
And it's all another birthday as well.

3980
04:39:42,790 --> 04:39:43,750
So happy birthday.

3981
04:39:43,750 --> 04:39:44,630
I want to make sure I caught that.

3982
04:39:44,630 --> 04:39:45,110
I didn't see it.

3983
04:39:46,229 --> 04:39:47,590
Happy birthday to the bath bath as well.

3984
04:39:48,310 --> 04:39:50,150
And happy birthday to the rumor.

3985
04:39:51,619 --> 04:39:52,740
See you guys tomorrow.
