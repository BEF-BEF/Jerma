00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:12,500
Hello, how you guys doing? Welcome back to the stream. The stream is currently bopping. I mean,

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:21,609
it's on. I wouldn't necessarily say the stream is bopping right now because, I mean, it's not

3
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:24,969
there's not, it's not like anything crazy is happening right now or anything cool.

4
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:31,620
I mean, I guess the planets are cool. Nobody dancing though. Well, I mean, the jay is kind

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:40,740
of dancing. That's me. It's bopping. I retract my statement. When I say nothing, I mean nothing like

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:47,859
cool on that. This is the starting card and it is cool, but I'm talking about like nothing's

7
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:56,950
nothing cool happened yet on camera and the pre-stream voice. That's yeah, that's it.

8
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,079
Moving on to the real thing now. No, hope you're doing well. Before we get going, I want to talk

9
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,560
about a couple of things because they're very important and it is going to affect the streams

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,819
and I want to keep you guys in the loop of things because you know, that's that's what we do here.

11
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:24,090
So I am currently on a couple of new medications for my stomach

12
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:33,019
and one of them is kind of hard to manage. We'll just put it that way.

13
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:45,379
So the streams over the next week, there are going to be more streams, but they are going

14
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:50,579
to be shorter. So instead of streaming a few times for six, seven, eight hours,

15
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,060
I'm going to stream more than a few times, like probably four or five times in a row here,

16
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:07,579
but only for like three or four hours at a time. So more days, less time because the medication

17
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:18,020
that I'm on is kind of makes it hard to sit here for more than a few hours at a time. It's sort of

18
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:26,699
difficult to do. So I figured that's probably a good way to do this. We actually like that. Well,

19
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,020
it's just for this week because I do like to stream for at least six hours or so.

20
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,969
And we're going to start with fear. We'll not start with, I mean, we did horror stuff last week. So

21
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:44,330
what you can expect over the next week, the original fear is what's going to happen now

22
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,580
and then into tomorrow and the next day or whatever, you know, how we do this,

23
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,419
how long it takes to beat fear. I am not going to move on to fear two and I'm not going to move

24
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:03,740
on to fear three, at least not now. I've been told that fear two and fear three are not very good.

25
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:13,659
I've heard that fear one is great, but then the other two are really not even close. I'm not saying

26
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:23,080
I will not play them on stream. They're just not a priority. I also have the thing on PC. If you

27
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,530
don't know the thing, it's supposed to be the sequel to the movie, I guess. It looks like it's

28
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,710
going to be crazy. I've never played the thing. I've heard it's wild. There's also a couple of

29
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:46,580
PlayStation two horror games that I have, which we will try and mess around with. And then there's

30
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,379
a bunch of rhythm games and then it's Halloween. So that's kind of what you're looking at for the

31
00:03:53,379 --> 00:04:03,000
next couple of weeks. But without further ado, let's get started because I don't want to sit

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,639
here for more than a few minutes because I'm kind of up against the clock. I will not go into the

33
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,800
gritty details on this, but we got to go. You know what I mean? We've got to start. So here we go.

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:31,209
I think there's a camera on. It's not. Why is the camera not on? Well, you can see that.

35
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:40,379
What the F? What the F? I really don't want to start saying F words. Like,

36
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:48,740
fuck. Did you guys know? I didn't even know this. I didn't know that you could say the F word on TV.

37
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:56,459
Did you guys know that? I thought I thought it was just shit. And, uh, and I didn't think you could

38
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:05,660
say that for it on TV. You could do it once once over a whole season or just once in an episode.

39
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:17,540
Do you have to pick the one place you get to use it once per episode? When are they going to get

40
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:28,540
rid of that? I'm just thinking about this right now. Like shit, dick, fuck, asshole. Who cares?

41
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:41,110
You're like seven-year-old kids and not watching The Sopranos. So why? The demographic for these

42
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:55,209
TV shows are for adults. We just pretend that adults don't say swears. I don't get it. The rule

43
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:02,089
is with the boomers. Yeah, but what about what your kids might hear? Okay, so if I have a DVD

44
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:07,209
player and I put an R rated movie in my DVD player and I press play and I watch it really loud in my

45
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:14,379
man cave, they're going to hear that too. What's the difference? It's like it's my house. I decide

46
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:22,019
the swears that come through my speakers. You know what I mean? Like, sure. Like, oh, this is

47
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,100
mature content in it, right? That people do that. Why can't I determine the kind of square words

48
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:37,110
that I have in my house? I'm just realizing this right now. That's fucking weird. Don't say shit on

49
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:46,230
TV. What? Why? Oh, fucking the world. You know what I mean? I'm supposed to go. Dude, my mom is

50
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:57,860
watching. Your mom probably says the word fuck a hundred times a day. You're just not in the room.

51
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,670
You're at school. Your mother like probably like stubs her toe and it's just like, fuck,

52
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:21,240
fuck, fuck. And then you walk in there like, honey, how was school today? I know this because I

53
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,629
caught my mother swearing. She was like making up. She was doing like a, she was making something

54
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,310
like a, she was baking something. And I just heard, she didn't know I was in the room.

55
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:39,910
This is when I was like, I don't know, I was like 17, 18. And I just hear like, she didn't know I

56
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,149
came in and I just hear like this fucking recipe is so fucking stupid. What the fuck is with this

57
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:52,230
fucking fucking recipe is fucking stupid. And I was like, Holy shit. Wow. And then she turned,

58
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:01,050
it was like, Oh, and she was like, sometimes when people get at, I gotta go. All right. What am I?

59
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:13,699
Low difficulty, not low, but made fun of. Not extreme. No. This guy, this guy, this game is

60
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:19,699
like 15 years old. Extreme difficulty means it's impossible to beat. You die in like one bullet.

61
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:27,379
I'm not doing that. I'm not doing extreme. No, we're going to do moderate. We're going to do,

62
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,540
we're going to do somewhere high increase enemy action. We're going to do weapons image

63
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,970
recommended for veteran players looking for a challenge. Moderate default enemy actually

64
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:44,629
weapon damage recommended for experienced players. Novice and casual. I ain't one of those. I'm an

65
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:51,750
experienced player. It's too late. There's no confirmation. I'm an experienced player.

66
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,789
I would do high. Well, we can change it on the fly. I think. Okay. Situational high level alert

67
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:03,590
has been issued. Mission fear teams to report for emergency briefing on the situation. You've

68
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,509
just been transferred to the unit as a point man. This will be your first assignment with fear.

69
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:17,700
He's going with two today. In 2002, the U S army formed a secret unit dedicated to

70
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:25,460
combating paranormal threats to national security. The unit was named first encounter assault recon.

71
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,120
Oh, for short, an iPad strategy game that just came out on the app store last week.

72
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,399
Sierra entertainment. That's an old one. Ma Monolith made this. That's right.

73
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:55,580
This is way too low. I can't even hear this. Hopefully you can. Nope. Oh, they're the ones

74
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:07,899
that made shadow of war, by the way. It's a great studio. That is so small. It's an eye exam.

75
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:24,409
Hope you guys like the subtitles. Pretty good movies. Sound clip too. We're going to be

76
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:40,759
criticizing this whole time. I hope you understand. Grant good Eve grant. Wait, the TF2 engineer is in

77
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,700
this game already plus five letter grades. Who's the, who's the, who's grant good Eve?

78
00:10:46,700 --> 00:11:04,539
What the fuck did I do that for? What's that guy? Is he going to do it to you?

79
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:19,779
Oh, that's, that's the ATC of alcohol, tobacco and cheaters. Like it's cheating in video games,

80
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:41,480
the ATC. I know that one. I have to like not laugh today. Currently got a lot going on down here.

81
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:06,360
We can still resolve this discreetly, but we have to move. I don't think so. We got to find,

82
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:14,889
we got to find grant good Eve. This wacko's name is Paxton Fettle. He's the key. If we contain him,

83
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:20,490
we contain the situation. Fucker's got an appetite. I think he has an agenda. It's not just

84
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,090
you got to turn on VSync. Essential vitamins and nutrients. It's not looking good. What's his story?

85
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:31,610
Property of Armicam technology corporation. They're working on a military contract to develop

86
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,049
an army of clones that respond to a psychic commander. Top secret, of course. Fettle is one

87
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,690
of the commanders. You gotta be fucking kidding me. This is why nobody takes us seriously.

88
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,049
A full battalion of them, highly trained, heavily armed, full battalion. What are we supposed to do

89
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:53,610
against a thousand super soldiers? Like I said, we put Fettle down and it's over.

90
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,289
Fortunately, the whole point of the program is to give commanders firsthand knowledge of the

91
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:02,009
battlefield. That's not Boston. What are you talking about? Knowledge of the commander without

92
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:07,049
having to wade through all those soldiers. That's like Wisconsin, Boston. Planted a transmitter in

93
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:11,610
his head. Should lead us right to him. That's awfully convenient. Assuming it does what it's

94
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,490
supposed to. What about you buddy? Ready to go to work? You're putting him in the field?

95
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:25,210
Are you crazy? He just transferred in a week ago. Of course. His reflexes are totally off the charts.

96
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,690
I think he can handle himself. Whatever man, it's your call. Goddamn right it is.

97
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,730
Why do I feel like that's the kind of hat like a guy at the gym is going to have on?

98
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:04,659
Okay, car plus one letter grade. No sign of enemy activity on the satellite, but don't take any

99
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,220
chances. Jenkowski, you in position? Just say the word. All right, move it out.

100
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,190
Situation. F.E.A.R. mission coordinator Rowdy Betters has tracked enemy commander Paxton Fettle

101
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:23,750
to an abandoned building in Auburn District. Hannibal III spy satellite in Geo Synchronous

102
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,460
orbit shows no signs of replica soldiers in vicinity. F.E.A.R. combat operatives will

103
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,899
infiltrate target site from two separate entry points and attempt to neutralize Fettle. According

104
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,379
to Armachem, technical advisor, once Fettle is contained, replica soldiers will become inactive

105
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,899
and can be rounded up without incident. Investigate area for signs of Paxton Fettle. I could have just

106
00:14:46,899 --> 00:15:04,889
read that part. Let's turn the volume up a little. Let's make it a little louder. I came in here

107
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:11,049
earlier. I'm trying to make it like a nice level for you guys. I don't want you to have your ears

108
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:24,220
hurt. And yes, I did get the I got the 90 FOV changer. So this should be at a good FOV. All

109
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,340
right. Do I have a map? What do I got a gun? That's very loud. That's like so loud that I may have

110
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:41,210
just scared the shit out of a lot of you. And I'm going to change that now. That's an explosion.

111
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,309
That that to me is the hearing that and how scary that was and how fucking abrupt it was.

112
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,149
That's like, what did you put in the microwave that exploded?

113
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,700
Like how long did you leave the bag of popcorn in there for? All right, well, how do I crouch?

114
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:08,620
Okay, made it. C. C and then it's, I guess you could shoot it too. Do you have infinity ammo?

115
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,799
Yeah, you just sprint normally. All right, so let's go. We gotta get in here.

116
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:26,970
Okay, no, we go this way. Thank God I could put toggle on. I did that before we started.

117
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:32,679
Press use to open doors or activate objects. All right, so use.

118
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,970
Really? Okay, I thought I was just I was about to make a joke about me being on fire,

119
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,610
but you can catch fire. Good to know. Tutorial. Wait, anything over?

120
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:59,289
Fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Wait, is it back for like vengeance?

121
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:19,880
How do I have flashlight, right? Plus V to use flashlight. I have a battery in the flashlight.

122
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,759
That's great. Please help us keep this room clean.

123
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,829
Why did you punch the glass out? Try to find a way around.

124
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:49,029
Rendezvous with Jan Kowski. All right, find a way around. Hey, bro. What a trash in here.

125
00:17:49,670 --> 00:18:22,900
Come here, you little fuck. Wait, I can slide? Holy shit, he exploded. Oh, man, that was terrible.

126
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,210
I, okay. I just need to, it's a tutorial. I need to test, see if I can do that stuff.

127
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:40,140
Pick up a hammer. Wait. Oh, what? No, I thought it was pick up hammer. I can't use hammer. Oh,

128
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,349
that's a permanent health upgrade. I'm assuming it's like half life.

129
00:18:47,910 --> 00:19:15,430
Come on, open for space to jump. Wait, open it. I can't. I can't open this. Touch door,

130
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:26,740
Easter egg. I can't like fit through that. I don't have an okay. The print is so small.

131
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:55,740
I cannot, I don't see. It's like I've 71 in that. What? All right. My accuracy rating.

132
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:03,720
Oh shit, I can knock him down. That's wasting ammo. Right. All right. Right. Right. All right.

133
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,009
Okay. I'm not going to waste ammo. Why'd you bring me here? Why'd you bring me back?

134
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:32,259
That was a delayed reaction there. All right. When were we supposed to just go around to find

135
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:38,950
that guy? Jan Kowski. Is it ammo anywhere that I should be? All right. That just,

136
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,789
I thought that was somebody coming to get me. Shoot the padlock. Sure thing. First try. Ready?

137
00:20:46,519 --> 00:21:02,869
Shoot the padlock. Holy fuck. My God. All right. Where's Macaulay Culkin?

138
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,980
Hey, you would have had me. You would have killed, you would have killed me right there, Macaulay.

139
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:27,539
Didn't saw that one. Thin enough. Hold on a second. I was just, I just crashed the game.

140
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:37,619
You ready? Find a neutralized pack of Fettel. Go. And what's going on? What's, what happened to you?

141
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:47,500
Uh oh. Uh oh. I think that might have just been an Infinity Wars,

142
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:56,539
uh, an end game Marvel universe happening in the world here. If you have, it's, it's a spoiler

143
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:06,099
for Infinity. This is not even Marvel. Forget it. Jin, we need you up here. Looks like we're too

144
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:15,619
late, boss. Just leftovers. Gotta be around there somewhere. I'll wait here for Jin. You take a look

145
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,220
around. You guys are fucking hilarious. Infinity. No, I'm not going to make that. That's legit. Get

146
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,079
going. I'm talking to somebody in my earpiece right now. For all you know, I could be getting

147
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:39,700
some extremely important info. Dude, take a look around. Am I going to hit him in the face?

148
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:48,519
What are you, chicken shit or something? Look, you're the FNG. So you do as I say. What? Since

149
00:22:48,519 --> 00:23:01,339
when? All right, let's go. If somebody here, we're outside. Let's turn the flashlight off.

150
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:12,809
I'm trying to prove that I can shoot in video games and they're giving me all these

151
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:44,809
fucking stupid little opportunities to show you. Give me a light gun. I would have had that. Okay.

152
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:56,420
What about up? Maybe up. That looks, can I get in the window? That would hurt so bad. No,

153
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:05,700
I want to jump and hit the window. Okay. I don't know what I knocked. I know. Well,

154
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:16,680
I can't get back up there ever again. Oh well. These things boarded out. I'm making a mountain

155
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:31,609
out of a molehill here. I killed him. I would have killed him. I got him like four times in the chest.

156
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:54,869
Makes no difference. He deserved to die. They all deserve to die. Come in. Over. What's going on?

157
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:02,359
Last pedal signal. Rejoin the team. Tom cast? What kind of situation?

158
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:15,559
Let's head back down. We'll be ready. What was the whole, what was the point of me going up here?

159
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:33,990
Just to look at the roof. By the way, I have 47 bullets left. I have shot like 30 and there has

160
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,230
not been a single enemy on the screen. So I might need to restart the game and just run through this.

161
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:49,460
Hey, back already? See anything? You guys about done up there? Our day's just getting started.

162
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:59,450
You boys run along. I'll be busy here for a while. Why? Because the guy's dead. Breathe.

163
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:13,220
I've tried to forget. I've tried so hard to forget.

164
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:29,059
Okay. These men are from fear. There are special attachments to our unit for the duration of this

165
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,099
up. They will be on point. Their mission is to assess the nature of the threat.

166
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:39,859
Our job is to keep them alive. Do not engage the enemy. Remember that we are not dealing with

167
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:45,859
ordinary bad guys. Team one will move in from the southwest. Team two will approach from the north.

168
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:49,380
Once our recon is complete, we will rendezvous and wait for further orders.

169
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:58,119
Okay. Let's saddle up. What if you're not on any, any team? Do I just stay in the helicopter?

170
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Oh, right. Yeah. James, right. You, you go ahead and you open up your iPad and find us a good

171
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:32,119
place to eat after. Really important job. Okay. I guess. Yes, sir. Open up Google maps and just

172
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:36,630
type in food. That is actually pretty good.

173
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,500
Oh, yeah. This is little bird. We're on the ground. Let's go.

174
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,670
You're on point. See if you can get this kid open. Okay. I'd send one of my boys,

175
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:59,109
but I think we need a specialist for this one. Yeah. Stupid. Yeah. Since we got a Tweedledee

176
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:10,900
and Tweedledum over here, I think I can do, I'm going for it. Yes, sir. These two idiots. All

177
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:29,539
right. Uh, I think it might be over in here. What was it? A price scanner? Reflex booster.

178
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:55,910
Reflex is permanently boosted. Okay. Anything up here? No. Hey, I didn't, I didn't find that. I

179
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:25,940
found a reflex booster though, dude. Cool. It's not over here. You know, it'd be good if we all

180
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:39,269
looked instead of just telling me to do this. It doesn't work. Shoot the, shooting the gate doesn't

181
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:49,940
do anything. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why would anybody do that? Did I miss it over here? Maybe

182
00:29:49,940 --> 00:30:13,079
it's, yeah, I can keep going. I think there we go. Okay. Can I use this? Does it explode? Yep.

183
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,170
They just hear, they hear that downstairs over there. They hear a fucking explosion.

184
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:34,089
Dude, you just have to press a button. What are you doing up there? Okay. Hey, I found the button.

185
00:30:34,809 --> 00:31:09,799
It's up here. It's going to be, yep. Coming. They're all skeletons.

186
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:32,380
If you look at her, you die. You turn it. That's like super Medusa. Medusa just turns you to stone.

187
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:40,339
This peels all your skin and muscles off and melts you. That's kind of fucked up. Status unknown.

188
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,500
Both teams have gone silent and fear teams. Life signs monitors are offline. Interference

189
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,019
is preventing satellite reconnaissance. Surviving operatives should attempt to rendezvous in an

190
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:54,019
exfiltrate mission area until reinforcements arrive rendezvous with Jan Kowski's team.

191
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:24,819
All right. Um, that's an interesting, how do they, okay. Warning. These premises are monitored.

192
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:41,720
Trespassers will be prosecuted. I probably just got pressing a button. Yeah. Don't have to worry

193
00:32:41,720 --> 00:33:08,250
about. I know what that's like. The kill command activated. Okay. Yeah. Is there any stuff in this

194
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,819
game? I like this game already because it's not stuff to pick up. I have problems with games with

195
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:45,210
when you have stuff to pick up these people. I thought we were not. Oh, these bad. Okay.

196
00:33:45,210 --> 00:34:01,369
Okay. Wait, what? What happened? Hold on. Did I lose? Did I lose the game?

197
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:14,599
All right. Okay. For a second, I thought we, I was rendezvousing and I stood there and exploding.

198
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,380
There was explosion that way. All right. I get it. Let's go.

199
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,059
I just started.

200
00:34:23,260 --> 00:35:00,329
Do it. Good. Here we go. All right. Good. Ammo. Please listen closely as our menu options have

201
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:06,469
changed. It's been like that for fucking seven years. I think people know by now.

202
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:38,059
I don't know what's in here. All right. He's dead. I should be peeking way more often than I do.

203
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:48,599
All right. Wait, hold on. Everybody up there. Health kits, health bleach. I don't know. I'm

204
00:35:48,599 --> 00:36:13,539
going to go up. It seriously is fucking home alone. What's in here? Oh, med kit to use med

205
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:18,179
kit T to restore some of your health. You can carry up to 10. Okay. Well, that's good to know.

206
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:24,440
I think I've got a med kit. I want to upgrade the flashlight. I ain't going that way yet.

207
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:43,530
There's another place to go down here. Is it fall damage? Nope. Best game ever. Okay. Nothing

208
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:53,449
out here. Can I not break through this? I can't just turn sideways and slide through there.

209
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:13,000
Oh, well, I guess not. I'm too, I'm too fat apparently. Yeah. That's all good. All right.

210
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:26,010
I got everything I needed. Uh, let's keep going. T is health kit, right? Uh, I didn't really mean to

211
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:39,130
do that, but it's okay. No, don't. Oh, wait, no, I want to go that way. Okay. That's how you get it.

212
00:37:40,739 --> 00:38:00,969
Why am I sliding on this? Oh, that's how you get out. Very cool. Let's go. Checkpoint. That's not it.

213
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:39,980
Mouse three is mouse three is different because I changed it. Oh, I can't, I can't laugh that hard.

214
00:38:44,710 --> 00:39:02,230
Oh shit. He was smart. What happened to that guy? What was that explosion? All right. I'm good.

215
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:18,699
The gun play is actually pretty fun. All right. I got a pistol. That's a, that's a double pistol.

216
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:41,940
We've got health 95. Any, uh, potions. It's fun. That's fun to shoot.

217
00:39:49,989 --> 00:40:07,300
Right in the head. All right. I gotta be careful. I need armor. I gotta take flashlight off of V by

218
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,219
the way. It's getting in the way. It's me. I'm hitting C accidentally because I don't know

219
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:35,690
where the CV and X are on the keyboard and I'll laugh it up. It's fine. I don't see anybody. No,

220
00:40:35,690 --> 00:41:21,639
don't break it. Hello. We all right. We good. Okay. Pacific rim. He's just like tripped. Check

221
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:44,219
it out and go see what happened. All right. We're good. Do you get a shotgun in this game?

222
00:41:44,780 --> 00:42:03,610
Cause damn, that would be fun. Yep. Oh, good. Good. Good. Good. Fizzy Cola. Dice. Dicked. Squish.

223
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:13,340
I feel like the, the, that's like what you guys write in donation messages.

224
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:30,170
What? Oh, that's a grenade. How long did you hold that for? The timing on that was incredible.

225
00:42:31,619 --> 00:43:16,280
What is mouse for? I have to heal. They have these insane grenades. I have them too, but

226
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:24,900
they blow up really fast. They are cooking these things for a full seven or eight seconds. Use the

227
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:37,750
slow mo. Oh, the camera's in a bad spot. Hold on. On the next save point. I'll move it. The game

228
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:56,599
hasn't, the game hasn't taught me to use the slow mo yet though. What's that? So I need to be true

229
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:21,860
to the video game. I can, I don't want to break that though. Oh, fuck. That's like super slow mo

230
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:27,780
videos. That guy's head rocked in a circle like five. That's how, you know, I hit him really hard.

231
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,639
That's like when you punch somebody in the face, like slow motion, it's like,

232
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:39,559
your face like turns to fucking yellow and you can see their eyes and skull pulsate and rock back

233
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:53,320
and forth. That's so bad. Okay. That's a good strategy though is slow mo punching face.

234
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:09,349
Anybody else in here? Oh shit. Pick up. What is that? It's an assault rifle

235
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:17,699
and another pistol. How loud is this? It's actually pretty quiet. It's like underwater.

236
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:27,210
Cool. All right. I'm not going to use it yet. We'll stick with the default. Is this a new pistol

237
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:39,989
or is this just two of these? Tri-wheeled. Hold the other one in your mouth, just like with your

238
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:55,429
teeth. They hit you with like feet. Pop on one foot and like, that'd be so funny. Why hasn't a

239
00:45:55,429 --> 00:46:00,329
video game done that? Like laugh out loud kind of humor. You got three pistols. Oh, here comes like

240
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:05,369
a foot on camera up there. What a fucking hilarious moment that would be for all these streamers and

241
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:11,079
YouTubers. If you could see, if you could see, what did it say? If you can see the blinking,

242
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:34,469
it means what? That it can be activated. Okay. Loud noises. Anything else? What if he's like

243
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:45,900
blocking something? Nope. You know, there could be something under there. Like it could be any

244
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,900
situation where, oh, there's a grenade under there because you did that. All right. Let's go.

245
00:46:52,019 --> 00:47:01,210
I, it's, I can't do this. It's a puzzle. I don't, I didn't think this was a puzzle game. I don't

246
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:30,340
want to do it anymore. I think I'm done. What? That's so much better than me. That projectiles.

247
00:47:36,900 --> 00:48:03,800
Oh fuck. Okay. Don't fuck it up again. God damn it. This is far. Okay. Med kid. I didn't,

248
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:22,489
they all just kind of spawned and came at me. Are you, why is it on pulse fire now?

249
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:45,880
They were not this many before. Did it add enemies? All right. Let's go. Fuck. Okay. Is there,

250
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:59,690
oh, there is a save. Okay. I didn't know. Is it, was it F5? Quick saving. All right. Well,

251
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:44,070
now, well now I know. Whoa. See ya. All right. Where are those grenades? Quick save.

252
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:54,780
There's grenades in here. I know there is. Okay. Got that. Where are the grenades?

253
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:11,500
Come on. That can go off. There's nothing behind there or anything. Really? Okay. Fine. Whatever.

254
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:23,610
All right. Got that. There's no grenade. There they are. That's kind of cool. I'm going to do

255
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:38,119
that to somebody in slow mo. Quick save. Here we are. I made it. Wait, wait, that's got armor too.

256
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,239
They drop armor. That's, that's pretty sick. All right. All right. Here we go.

257
00:50:55,059 --> 00:51:01,460
That guy, that guy like threw it like this. Why did he go like this? Usually you throw, you go,

258
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:09,269
all right, man, let's like throw it. No, he went like this. Here we go. Like he said, oh, I'm going

259
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:26,650
to windmill. He threw it right into the ground. He reversed softball pitch that good back upstairs.

260
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:38,010
Here we go. So he baseball pitched it. No, no, no, you don't pitch like that in baseball.

261
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:44,980
Nobody does. Nobody goes spin, spin up here and let's go up here. Nobody does that.

262
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:54,920
You do that under and you let go for softball. You don't do that in baseball. I know this.

263
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:25,369
I can't climb through that. All right. Let's jump kick. Wait, I think I got him.

264
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:38,619
I think I did it. Did he say, oh, slow mo. He didn't say that. Right. Am I just injecting that in?

265
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:49,590
Ah, why did my motherboard come out of the fucking monitor? What? Oh, he was so psyched.

266
00:52:50,630 --> 00:53:05,130
Oh, shit, no way, dude. Slow mo. That's so cool. Okay. Here we go. Listen to the message.

267
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:21,019
This is it. They come out of the door. Get it ready. Ready? Hold on. Check this out.

268
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:27,820
They come through that door, right? Watch this. This is gonna be cool. It's gonna be cool. I think.

269
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,739
That was pretty cool. I mean, it was pretty cool.

270
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:04,710
Hey, dude. Look at it. When did this game come out? This actually is pretty good. This is like

271
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:14,230
pretty advanced shit for a game that had a future being 2002. When did this game come out? Like 1999?

272
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:18,150
The year is 2002. Like that's supposed to be the future, right? When does it come out?

273
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,659
2005. Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's still, that's more than 10 plus years ago. All right. Hold on.

274
00:54:27,659 --> 00:55:01,059
Did I miss anything? It said 2005. Well, sorry. It's in six point font. Gun, armor. Nice. I'm here.

275
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:33,860
Did he say Pog? I'm telling you, you guys have ruined me. Grenade of Pog. Okay. Let's keep going.

276
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,659
Did I miss anything? I want to make sure I don't miss anything. No, it's just some boxes.

277
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:54,250
Rifle, rifle, rifle, rifle. Yeah. That guy's got a rifle. I'll get it. What?

278
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,920
It's got a shot in the head. Oh, a bullet in the head. What the fuck was that? Did a fly just fly

279
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:33,460
into my visor? What is it? Damn it. How many healed? All right. Assault rifle. Upgrades.

280
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:41,210
Games with upgrades. I love them. When does the game get scary? It kind of already has been,

281
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:51,380
don't you think? There's been like a few weird, scary. I mean, this, this is doing the scary

282
00:56:51,380 --> 00:57:00,460
little girl thing back when that was in the height of its scariness. That looks like an exit.

283
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:10,389
I want to get this stuff. Nothing else. And telephone that's not off the hook.

284
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:25,750
And then, but they still, they're still doing the scary little girl thing. They just turned it into

285
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:42,019
a doll. It's evolved. Your height and reflexes will give you an edge against enemies. Press

286
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:45,539
slow mo to enter slow motion. See, I told you, they didn't give me a tutorial for it yet. And

287
00:57:45,539 --> 00:58:31,639
you guys are trying to get me to do it. I didn't know what happens. Oh, the recoil. All right.

288
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:48,300
Let's end this guy with a kick. Damn it. Where the hell are you? Where's this guy? Did he die?

289
00:58:50,230 --> 00:59:05,530
No, there's somebody still over here. No, he's dead. Good. Checkpoint. Save. Let's keep going.

290
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:28,340
Do a side kick. Ooh, what's that? Same thing I had? Yeah. Crouch and melee. A slide kick.

291
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:57,190
Do I have to be running for a certain amount? All right. Free slow mo. I could use it. Fucking

292
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:04,900
idiot. I just had to do it. It's like my attention problems. I thought I was far enough away.

293
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:27,610
Let's keep going. All right. Hold on. Um, doesn't look like you have anything.

294
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:36,760
No, dude, turn your own stream off. What are you fucking an amateur?

295
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:57,980
They don't have any stuff. This looks safe. I would highly doubt that, but you know, it's all good.

296
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:16,679
So slide kick, huh? Do I have to hold crouch? How do you do a slide? Double tap. We've got to be

297
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:39,340
sprinting first. Am I not sprinting already? Oh, I probably should run. I thought it was a cut scene.

298
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,340
I thought it was, okay, I thought it was a, I thought it was like a thing that we were watching.

299
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:56,460
It was playing music. It was like, I thought it was one of these kind of scenarios.

300
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:09,980
Someone, someone, there is nothing here. Just get to the turnaround and didn't do it first

301
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:28,730
try. That means we don't do it at all. All right. Part two, quick save often. You're supposed to die

302
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:33,769
there. So then the game can tell you, Hey, I mean, just want to let you know, you probably should

303
01:02:33,769 --> 01:02:38,090
save all the time. You see, I wouldn't have done that unless you guys told me to. So you know what

304
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:59,940
I'm saying? Okay, here we go. Did I make it? I was trying to go through the door, but I got,

305
01:03:00,659 --> 01:03:19,750
I jumped out. Okay. Cool. He's alive. He doesn't appear to be injured, although I don't know how

306
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,750
we survive. Injury level three escalation.

307
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,190
You can't send him in alone. That's crazy.

308
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:42,659
When we're just, I was just in there doing the go, I could go back in. All right. I'm going back in.

309
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:50,920
Can we trade your standing out here? You better get going. You're not in any immediate danger.

310
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,639
You're sending me in to go kill this guy. I want the better gun. You don't have to give me your

311
01:03:55,639 --> 01:04:05,320
helmet too. It's the same gun. No, it's not. His is bigger. Let's compare guns. Well, whatever. I

312
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:18,500
want your ammo. Just take your clip out. Wait, what about, where does it want me to go? What was

313
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:40,179
that? Oh, okay. Dead guy. Okay. No, this is our choice. Not our choice. This is our chance.

314
01:04:41,619 --> 01:05:19,269
What's this? Fuck. That's such a, I want that so bad. Bad guys. Now I see three tubes. That's an

315
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:29,030
explosion. Wouldn't happen, right? Or are they punching bags? Okay. Don't fuck around there.

316
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:44,860
One shot. Come on. Why am I getting flashbacks of a different game? What game did this happen in?

317
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:57,670
This happened in a game, right? I'm not insane. Am I? I remember being like on that exact bridge.

318
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:16,920
All right. Listen to the message. This turn on. Did I turn the alarm on? No. All right. This

319
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:26,489
changes this to go this way. Wait, what about down here? Any guns or weapons or hidden secrets or

320
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:42,840
something? Probably not, but I'm just going to do it. It doesn't look like it. Nope. Wear the shot.

321
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:53,739
Why not just build two bridges? Yeah. It seems very, very stupid. Why do you need an entire

322
01:06:53,739 --> 01:06:59,860
electronic mechanism to spin this around when you could just have it cross in the middle? Slide

323
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:15,380
kick. How do you? All right. Let me get the slide kick down. Let's walk. I am running. I missed an

324
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:25,289
upgrade. What? Back to the boxes. Check the controls. All right. So controls. Configure

325
01:07:25,289 --> 01:07:35,739
controls. Toggle walk. Movement. Step right, turn, lift side, walk, jump, crouch. Toggle walk.

326
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:48,170
Interaction. Flashlight, slow-mo, aim, reload, throw grenade. Look down, center view, inventory.

327
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:52,340
Fear one doesn't have a sprint. Yeah. So how do you do the slide kick?

328
01:07:53,300 --> 01:08:03,179
All right. Let me step back to the boxes because I missed something. Did I? It's forward crouch

329
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:17,989
melee. Holy shit. Oh, nice. Reflex is permanently boosted. So you got to go like that. Okay. Can

330
01:08:17,989 --> 01:08:32,229
you do it in the air? Sort of. Ow. That's a broken ankle. All right. So I moved to the thing, right?

331
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:40,710
We're going to go this way. Save it. All right. Turn the flashlight off. We don't need it right

332
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:56,920
now. Okay. Down into the sewer. I don't think fall damage exists. It does not. It's been confirmed.

333
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:16,180
You can jump anywhere you want. Literally anywhere. God. Okay. Narrow tunnels. Great.

334
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:27,590
I don't have any grenades. Otherwise I just would have thrown one down this hole.

335
01:09:28,310 --> 01:10:01,430
Fresh blood on the ceiling. Ooh. Health booster. What? What? What? Why is my heart beating? 110.

336
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:27,460
Nice. All right. Um, caution. I thought that was a person. I go in this building. No admittance. Oh,

337
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:49,430
well. Peak. All right. There's health over there. There's a guy right there. Okay. Here it comes.

338
01:10:49,430 --> 01:11:08,949
Okay. Slide. Ready? Here it comes. Did you hear that? Oh, what happened out here? Oh, Frank was

339
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:17,529
practicing back flips again. This time that's, he ain't going to be practicing anymore. Imagine

340
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:23,449
exploding because you did try to do a back flip and you grazed your head on the ground.

341
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:44,260
Holy shit. Holy shit. I wonder what that looks like. You know, we always get to see from the

342
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,579
perspective of the person playing the game, what slow motion looks like, but we never get to see

343
01:11:48,579 --> 01:11:53,560
what it looks like on the other side. I want to see what that looks like on the other side.

344
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:14,619
Are you just really fast? You're just super fast. Okay. Ooh. Grenade. What's that? Nothing.

345
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:22,229
That's not what that sounds like. Okay. Let's keep going. What about the lockers?

346
01:12:22,949 --> 01:12:35,819
When am I going to move my camera? That's, I know. All right. I'll do it right now. Where should I

347
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:55,850
put it? Is there a good place for this to go? Top right? That's okay. All right. That's better.

348
01:12:56,489 --> 01:13:01,109
I'm not going to put it in the center of the screen. There you go. Now you can see

349
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:09,699
there. Put it right in the middle. I'm not going to put it right in the middle.

350
01:13:10,579 --> 01:13:18,869
No. You know how many times I've done that? Doing that. Put webcam in middle, make it three times

351
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:32,789
bigger. All right. Let's slide. Uh, another person. How would you know I was coming?

352
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:37,939
We're going to slide tackle the first person that comes down the hall. One, two,

353
01:13:37,939 --> 01:14:17,859
two, three. Shit. Who's left? Ooh. New gun. Slide tackle this guy. Where is he? Isn't he right

354
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:42,310
there? Oh, no, they're dead. Okay. But is this a new gun? Stuff. Is it stuff? Why is there a

355
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:58,460
ladder here? Oh, all right. I just, this is just the way to go. Oh, come on. Really free stuff,

356
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:06,630
secret stuff. No, I didn't get, no, there's nothing there. Go get it. There's something there.

357
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:56,789
I'm just not trying to make as much noise as possible. How many? One, two. Wait, why am I

358
01:15:56,789 --> 01:16:39,350
going so slow? Oh, got him. No, that hurts more than a bullet. Turn the light off. I don't have

359
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:48,199
any more grenades left. Bad. Should I switch to the other gun? No. What's the point of switching

360
01:16:48,199 --> 01:17:01,529
to another gun when you have the good one? Slow down. Is there anybody to jump kick? I want to

361
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:12,810
jump kick somebody through a window. Is that possible? Nothing in any of this shit. Come on.

362
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:27,449
Really? Am I blind? No. One of these times, one of these days, someone's going to just be standing

363
01:17:27,449 --> 01:17:34,810
around the corner and it's going to be awesome. Well, um, here comes a boss fight or something.

364
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:50,779
Why would this all be here? Is there, are there bosses in this game? Yeah, this is a boss. Look

365
01:17:50,779 --> 01:18:19,800
at this boss room. What? Oh shit. I froze up there. Holy shit. He got in. I can't see. Okay,

366
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:59,100
done. That's another person. There's one more. Where is he? Is he dead? He's dead. Okay. Healing.

367
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:14,039
Good. Anything else? Grenades. Copy machine. I did it. I did it. I did the thing. Guaranteed

368
01:19:14,039 --> 01:19:33,449
fucking comedy points. I did it. I'm going to go up and around. Got it. Okay. Keep going. Save it.

369
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:44,329
I love quick save. Seriously. It's so useful in every video game. Well, that's convenient.

370
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:53,640
I wonder what I'm supposed to do with these. Can I pick them up? I can't. But wait a minute,

371
01:19:53,640 --> 01:20:03,670
we got assault rifle, more of this. First aid, seven health packs. Should I? Okay. Should I

372
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:08,550
restart? Cause I, how much health do I have? I just took, no, I'm good. I didn't mean to do that.

373
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:19,979
That's fine. All right. I'm ready. Certain laptops contain useful information. Activate the laptop

374
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:43,060
to retrieve data stored on it. Why are there green tanks on the ground? If someone's not going to

375
01:20:43,060 --> 01:21:04,340
like scream and sprint down this hall. Okay. Good to know. Why are there green tanks on the wall?

376
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:15,079
I'm not on the wall. Only, you know what I mean? And there's this shit. Okay.

377
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:43,750
Look at all this prep. 80 armor. How's that? Save it. This is the door. Can I move this out of the

378
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:57,449
way and make like a shortcut? All right. Here we go. Whatever it is, it is. Turn up the difficulty.

379
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:13,260
No, no. Absolute zero. No. I have to like, we'll see after like another four hours. I can't,

380
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:21,529
I can't even turn the, look at it. Where can I do that? Game. Yeah. I know it. difficult HUD.

381
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:58,300
Okay. I'll put the difficulty to the HUD up at harder. Where's the grenade? Nice. What should,

382
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:17,050
what should I do? No, this is, this is like playing the division. Now everybody has like 5,000 HP.

383
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:49,939
It's like I can throw a grenade in here. No, don't you gonna get a shotgun? Too bad. Where's all

384
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:54,380
their ammo? I think I have full ammo in this gun. Let's use it for a little while. This thing's

385
01:23:54,380 --> 01:24:16,260
pretty sick. So save it. I can't, what the fuck was that? Now get me in here. Grenade. Nope. Just

386
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:23,939
a can of soda. They so badly want me to be ready. I have eight health packs. Is that what it is?

387
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:28,500
Is that why the difficulty had to be increased? Cause I have eight health packs and I'm only

388
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:32,979
supposed to have two or something. And oh yeah, you're so lucky. You can heal whenever you want.

389
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:37,220
Right. That's what it is. And yeah, I knew it. I knew it. I'm playing the game very, very, very

390
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:40,659
well. And all of a sudden it's like, you don't, you're playing too well. You have too many health

391
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:55,350
packs. Turn it up. Fine. How do I turn damage numbers on? Cause I might as well use that too.

392
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:21,380
Alligator or something. Let's give something in the water. In my opinion, this is just me,

393
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:26,119
but in my opinion, if there's like somebody waiting for you or stalking you here, there's like the

394
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:30,520
enemies. This is what I would do in this scenario for real. Instead of where the fuck are they?

395
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:35,539
Can they see me? I would just start fucking screaming and firing. And then they'd be like,

396
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:44,979
they'd be like, what the fuck? Wait, is he in here? See it worked. See that fucked him up

397
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:49,140
because they thought they were with it. When we go in the water and we sneak around and we say,

398
01:25:49,140 --> 01:26:07,189
we'll be careful. No, that ain't me. Hey, when he gets to 10 health packs, we should put it on

399
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:14,539
extreme difficulty. That is never going to happen. If you want to see a blind play through of extreme

400
01:26:14,539 --> 01:26:38,819
difficulty, you are watching the wrong video game live stream. All right, we're in.

401
01:26:53,210 --> 01:27:08,520
Cool. Did I die? No, I thought that was, all right, good. It's just blood. Hey! That was,

402
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:15,180
all right, that was kind of scary. It was. That was a little scary. Just a little.

403
01:27:28,539 --> 01:27:31,100
Wait, you think you're having a better journey than me? Think I'm having a cool, oh, I found

404
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:36,539
some. Oh yeah. Well, I found a, I know I found human remains too. And a fucking monster in the

405
01:27:36,539 --> 01:27:40,220
water was trying to kill me. I killed it though. I mean, but like, tell me more about how awesome

406
01:27:40,220 --> 01:28:27,100
your trip is. Am I underwater? There it is. It's huge though. It's unexpected that I still survived.

407
01:28:27,819 --> 01:28:33,100
Hey, it's all right. I've got a, I got 11 health pack. I can't even pick him up. I'm doing so well.

408
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:52,250
Extreme, extreme. No, that's not. Okay. We're good. I have to, I need to lure somebody over

409
01:28:52,250 --> 01:29:07,079
here to do this to them. She's afraid of you. Oh, wait. It's, this is like a new checkpoint.

410
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:23,960
Hold on. What's over here? I've already been here. It's like that game, you know, that game

411
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,119
where you, where you've hit the ice down, the little squares and the penguin falls through the

412
01:29:28,119 --> 01:29:41,189
middle. God, I've loved that game. Here we go. Where's the, where's it? Oh, right here.

413
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:56,229
Somebody just crashed a car. I want to use this. Can I roll it? This doesn't hurt me, right? Okay.

414
01:29:56,229 --> 01:30:12,819
I think I can do this. Is it on the ground? I don't think I can do it unless I can hit it right

415
01:30:12,819 --> 01:30:21,340
here. Get it out of the, okay. Now, what the, how the fuck does that physics make any sense? I'm

416
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:33,109
trying to roll this way. Keep going. All right. If you hit it in the front, it rolls backwards.

417
01:30:35,939 --> 01:31:03,079
Fuck it. All right. I did not expect them to be standing right here. They do this thing where

418
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:07,079
it's almost like they're auto targeted on you and they're strafing around you. So their hand goes

419
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:12,520
like aiming at like different directions behind them and to the right and left of them.

420
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:55,560
This is my opportunity. He just kicked me in the face and killed me. How far away am I?

421
01:31:56,680 --> 01:32:08,069
What the fuck? Why did I not save it? No, I did. I did. Okay. I'm, you know, I'm,

422
01:32:08,069 --> 01:32:13,590
I just need to make a macro in this game or just like a script that runs in the background that

423
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:32,260
presses F5 every 10 minutes. That's not illegal. Oh shit. We both did the same thing. Where is this

424
01:32:32,260 --> 01:33:04,569
person? Don't die again. I'm stuck in the, my DPI just, why? What is happening? I'm using health

425
01:33:04,569 --> 01:33:19,850
potions. He's using this spin bot. Okay. There it is. HP. Was that an arm? Okay.

426
01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:44,489
No, this is not that, this is not that far. Yep. I don't, why do I not remember this?

427
01:33:45,210 --> 01:34:00,300
Anybody else not remember this? The game icebreaker right in the middle. I missed him. It

428
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:10,489
doesn't matter. I don't remember this at all. Did I go a different way? I think I went a different way.

429
01:34:22,729 --> 01:35:07,079
Shit. I got one. All right. Who's left? Anybody? Still left. Got it. Open the valve. Not yet. All

430
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:17,420
right. Lots of ammo over here though. Gimme, gimme, gimme. That's all. I have too much of this. It's

431
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:26,840
all right. I like to use, this thing's better, stronger, faster, less recoil. All right. Let's

432
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:33,180
go. You're playing, I'm playing daft punk. What do you mean daft punk?

433
01:35:57,619 --> 01:36:43,779
Get him. One grenade. Got it. It's like the, got it. Got reflex booster. Got it. I want to go this

434
01:36:43,779 --> 01:36:52,279
way. Shoot the grenade in midair. Oh, absolutely. We're doing that next. Second, I get an

435
01:36:52,279 --> 01:37:07,670
opportunity to. I'm doing that. I got one chance. What is this? Buoy? Looks like we're going down.

436
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:22,539
What the fuck did I just do? I'm throwing my, that's a G. Throws your gun on the ground. Okay.

437
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:35,189
Why would you ever do that? F and G being that close to each other is going to be very, very bad.

438
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:54,550
I don't think I want those two bound. Throw all your guns on the ground. All melee run.

439
01:37:55,189 --> 01:38:25,460
Oh, sour please. Here we go. What does that do? Raises the water level or I don't know. It does

440
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:32,520
something to the water. What does it say? Caution. Operate shouldn't buy certified operators only.

441
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:56,300
Okay. Ooh, it's full now and that can go over that way. All right. I don't trust this. What do

442
01:38:56,300 --> 01:39:18,060
you think? Grenade in there. Okay. That scared the shit out of me. Okay. I don't know. For some

443
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:25,670
reason, I thought I had to use that. How is it already broken? Impossible. What? Oh, this is

444
01:39:25,670 --> 01:39:31,100
where I came from. Right. Thank God. That's, you guys wonder why I'm doing that. Why does he keep

445
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:48,470
breaking those? Well, because it's a breadcrumb trip and I know where I've been. Oh baby.

446
01:39:50,069 --> 01:40:13,050
They're all alive. Dead. I thought he dropped the grenade on the ground. I was going to say, dude,

447
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:25,210
what the hell is the matter with you? Great commentary. Dude, what the hell is the matter

448
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:34,250
with you? Paying attention and focusing on where I'm going. Words coming out of my mouth to fill

449
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:43,939
dead air. Dude. Okay. Is this now? That's what I'm talking about. I'm never going to have another

450
01:40:43,939 --> 01:41:07,779
gun ever. I love, I love a shoddy. You know what I mean? Ooh, what are those mines? There's nothing

451
01:41:07,779 --> 01:41:43,460
in there. There's nothing in there. Oh, I don't, I can't. I mean, that was cool, but I thought he

452
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:59,859
was dead. Why haven't I been, are you serious? It bounced off the ceiling. It bounced off the

453
01:41:59,859 --> 01:42:21,000
ceiling, but it's okay. I still got it. Garlic bacon burger. That's a lot of fun to do, but I can

454
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:29,189
stop doing that. That's pretty dang fun to do, but not going to do that anymore. Here we go.

455
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:35,270
Shotgun save the game. Here we go. I'm not messing around anymore. Watch this one. Just going for it.

456
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:42,810
Mine. Just pick it up. Let's get a couple of these. Proximity. Press five to switch

457
01:42:42,810 --> 01:43:22,600
proximity. Okay. I'm telling you, they're not throwing them right. What's that? Okay.

458
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:36,229
Through the middle. Oh shit. It spins. No, I thought it was a gray. It wasn't a gray.

459
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:51,239
What the fuck did you come from the ceiling? What? That guy fell from the ceiling.

460
01:43:54,939 --> 01:44:11,699
Why are you crawling over here? Oh, this game is fucking ridiculous. I love it. Okay. Oh, what?

461
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:25,369
I hear auto. Oh shit. The wrong button. Ah, let me explain. Let me explain. Let me explain.

462
01:44:26,619 --> 01:44:33,020
This is melee. This is grenade. I got to stop putting these so close to each other.

463
01:44:39,270 --> 01:45:10,970
Grenade. Where is he? Up there. Come on. Fall. That sucks. Okay. Got some stuff. Back to the

464
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:33,430
shotgun. Move, move, move, move. Get up. What are you doing? What the fuck am I? What? Okay.

465
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:54,170
That doesn't work. I need explosions. Oh, we really would be great if I had, you know,

466
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:59,850
a couple of land mines would be fantastic right now, but I don't have them. I don't have any.

467
01:46:10,869 --> 01:46:44,680
Where is he? It didn't do anything. Why did he just turn off? Why was it so loud? What is this

468
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:56,550
thing? Oh shit. It's like a rail gun. All right. Save it. All right. Hold on. I think I got to go

469
01:46:56,550 --> 01:49:06,840
let auto outside. Give me a second. I'll be right back. I got to go see auto. Okay. He is taken care

470
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:13,640
of. And while there's a lot of people here, I do want to talk about this because I brought

471
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:19,270
it up in the beginning of the stream, but there weren't a whole lot of people here at the very

472
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:27,510
beginning. So this week I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach and they're kind of

473
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:34,630
like fucking me up a little. So what we're going to do is instead of streaming like six or seven

474
01:49:34,630 --> 01:49:40,550
hours a few times, we're going to do like four or five hours, like five times. You know what

475
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:51,640
I mean? So there's going to be more streams, but less time on each stream. So just want to make

476
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:57,720
sure people are aware of that because there is very specific reason why I will not go into the

477
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:03,000
details, but more streams, less time instead of the typical, what you used to is like six to eight

478
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:19,100
hours, like six, seven. I got a little nervous about that comment. Let's go. Oh, there I am.

479
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:28,579
So that was big guy. Wait, what am I doing? I need two headphones. It's so much better to play

480
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:33,770
games with headphones in. I've been missing a lot for the last like two straight decades. Damn.

481
01:50:34,409 --> 01:50:42,810
Okay. Do I, I want to keep this going for now. Get the shotgun. I want to try this weird laser

482
01:50:42,810 --> 01:51:11,979
pointer. Yes. Yes. I'm so happy it did that. Pulling out. Are they afraid of me?

483
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:18,579
Do I have them in a full retreat? What did I just do? I just put, I didn't pick up anything.

484
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:27,000
Why did it just took a health push? I didn't press anything. I did not press the button to

485
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:40,359
do that. Ooh, found the secret permanent health boost. I'll take it. 115. Nice. I love upgrades.

486
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:45,960
How much almond milk do I have in my fridge right now? Zero. Cause it's gone.

487
01:51:46,600 --> 01:52:10,409
Let's go back. I want to see how this gun works. Is it a one hit kill? Is that guy streaming?

488
01:52:10,409 --> 01:52:25,819
Where's he aiming? I want to see how he's aiming this gun. It's important to me.

489
01:52:28,140 --> 01:52:49,020
Nevermind. Oh, this thing is insane. Okay. That's crazy. It's wow. I like this thing.

490
01:52:49,020 --> 01:53:07,930
Is that gas? Yep. No, it's not. What's going on? Is this room filled with gas? I have no idea.

491
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:21,479
Oh, you can get that open, please. Oh, I don't know. Oh shit. What is going on here? Cool, dude.

492
01:53:21,479 --> 01:53:44,489
How do I get it? Oh, turn the gas off. Yep. Or rise the water. That works too. I got a checkpoint

493
01:53:44,489 --> 01:54:01,689
here. Hammer. Check the room first. Cause I can now go in here. I thought that was a person

494
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:07,029
crouched. Ooh, all right. Shotgun, but how loud is it going to be? Be careful.

495
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:15,479
I want this thing. This thing is awesome. One headshot and it just stuck to a wall.

496
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:24,140
It's beautiful. I love it. Swap the way. Oh, you can just take any three weapons you want.

497
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:33,640
That is very interesting. I'm glad you told me. Interesting stuff. Okay. I thought that one was

498
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:39,640
light weapons. Two was medium and three was heavy or something. I don't know. How am I supposed to

499
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:59,899
know? Save it right here. What is that? I hear something. Turn the flashlight off. This is a

500
01:54:59,899 --> 01:55:09,979
place to hide. I'm going to have to hide back here. I know it. Where is Alma? I don't know what you're

501
01:55:09,979 --> 01:55:23,340
talking about. Some secrets get buried deeper than others. But I know, Mr. Moody, the time for talk

502
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:34,220
is done. Please. No. All right. This is the guy. That's the guy we got to get rid of.

503
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:45,029
It's a real bad guy. Okay. But wait a minute. Didn't, wasn't there someone else? No, it wasn't. Okay.

504
01:55:45,029 --> 01:56:03,449
Hey, hey, a crawl, a crawling horror movie trailer girl. Of course. How could I have ever thought it

505
01:56:03,449 --> 01:56:08,979
was going to be something else? Then on all fours here, I'm running at the camera and then I just

506
01:56:08,979 --> 01:56:14,340
have to get sucked. I have to land on my stomach and get sucked backwards and then smash into a

507
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:53,210
mirror. So, okay. Mission three is pretty much done. No, it's not. Just make it down. Make it

508
01:56:53,210 --> 01:57:13,159
down. Make it down. Deserve to die. They all deserve to die. I wouldn't be scared. I just

509
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:20,039
didn't expect you to be there. No one can look cool when someone startles them. Guys, when Dwayne

510
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:25,399
the Rock Johnson is standing there and he's like flexing in a mirror, just like looking huge and

511
01:57:25,399 --> 01:57:29,880
fucking awesome and somebody comes up behind him and like grabs him, he's going to go,

512
01:57:31,640 --> 01:58:05,319
you can't, nobody looks cool that way. I'm trying to take out the cameras. What the fuck am I doing?

513
01:58:06,439 --> 01:58:25,300
All right. Here comes a little scary thing. I'm wasting ammo in this gun. Am I going to stream

514
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:43,189
with the rock? No, I don't, I don't think that's going to happen. I'm sorry. What this shit, what

515
01:58:43,270 --> 01:59:17,770
is it? All right, we got the info we needed. Get out of here. Wait, keep this room clean.

516
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:34,170
Something's going to jump out of here. Did I just grab onto it? I can't do anything about it.

517
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:47,220
There's nothing I can do, right? I don't think so. Maybe I should go down.

518
01:59:47,939 --> 02:00:18,630
Clean it. This is not visceral cleanup detail. Oh shit. Okay. It's mine. Get out of here. How do I

519
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:35,880
get down there? Got to go like around and down. Okay. I know like, like official, right? People

520
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:43,319
are writing like, oh, official Dwayne the Rock Johnson, official the rock. If it were you,

521
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:50,789
would you like my, my name is not official German 985. It's just German 985. Why does everybody

522
02:00:50,789 --> 02:00:55,670
think that that's a way to make it seem like it's legit? No, you would just be the rock.

523
02:00:56,310 --> 02:01:15,750
Official the rock. What? This guy's stunning. Something in the water. Something in the water.

524
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:38,890
They've been putting, they've been putting chlorine. I'm going to be completely honest

525
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:46,170
with you guys. Um, I looked over at you guys at chat and, uh, came back and turned my eyes

526
02:01:46,170 --> 02:01:51,609
on the doors in front of me. And it was more startling than if I actually saw what happened.

527
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:29,289
Holy shit. What the hell was that? What was that? What was that floating person?

528
02:02:31,210 --> 02:02:51,670
What was that? That was fucking weird. All right. I made it. Hey, stop. Why are you getting all scary

529
02:02:51,670 --> 02:02:55,350
now? Where's the guys? Where's the funny slide tackle the enemies and watch their heads hit the

530
02:02:55,350 --> 02:04:11,989
ground. You can't be scared of what you can't see. Told you in person. Where is she? Oh, fuck.

531
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:46,869
Why did it bounce off of him? What's going on? Do the thing.

532
02:04:48,920 --> 02:05:08,199
Oh, my. That'll find, sir. Origin. Origin. I knew it. Hit the lights. What do you mean hit the

533
02:05:08,199 --> 02:05:21,880
lights? You just turned them off and now they're back on. What? Boom. Right in the head. Still

534
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:49,220
alive? Right here. Do it. DPI. Fucking DPI. I'm not, I'm underneath you.

535
02:05:57,319 --> 02:06:20,170
What the fuck is happening? No, wrong button. DPI. Why do you do this to me?

536
02:06:21,050 --> 02:07:05,060
Did he just say that we're good? I think so. All right. Investigate time.

537
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:30,409
Holy fuck. Okay. I don't have any health packs left.

538
02:07:30,409 --> 02:08:33,430
Why are there so many people in here? You didn't have to do that. You did not have to do that.

539
02:08:38,699 --> 02:08:50,810
Oh, yeah. Okay. Save it here. I actually could have just had them burned by running down the

540
02:08:50,810 --> 02:09:49,180
hall. Should I go up here? Save it. Okay. Cool. I got armor. Jesus Christ. Where is this guy?

541
02:09:53,670 --> 02:10:27,380
Fucking hammer. Where? That is a lot of fun. Where the fuck is he?

542
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:57,619
What the fuck was that? Dude, I don't even know where I'm going right now. What's the mission?

543
02:10:58,869 --> 02:11:24,760
Find packs and fetal. I have no rail gun ammo. Oh, now I do. I'm not going to use it for a little

544
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:49,939
bit though. Give me a shotgun. Good ammo. I don't know. I don't know. I know. I know. Saving. Okay.

545
02:11:49,939 --> 02:11:53,939
Just save it again. Just double save. Just in case your computer crashes when your hard drive is

546
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:57,529
broken. That's saving on a different hard drive. You didn't think I thought about that?

547
02:11:58,409 --> 02:12:17,829
How would you explode from that far away?

548
02:12:21,850 --> 02:13:12,100
Dammit. No. No, no, no, no, no. Wait. All right. I was going to go backwards.

549
02:13:42,579 --> 02:14:03,060
Is this guy Canadian? No. I think he's Wisconsin. What the fuck was that? He's putting down mines.

550
02:14:05,189 --> 02:14:23,779
All right. Mines. So the goal is to get him to walk over his own mines. Sounds like plan B.

551
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:33,140
See you guys 45 or so minutes from now when we actually get that to happen.

552
02:14:33,699 --> 02:15:06,020
Oh, more rail gun to save. Hit the bell. I guess not. Wait, there might be others.

553
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:23,560
Grenade. Nothing else I need. All right. I can break that. How close can I get to these proximity?

554
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:27,850
So then, I mean, obviously I cannot go over there. What's the distance though? I just need to see.

555
02:15:28,949 --> 02:15:35,699
Is it one square or is it more than one? All right. That's not bad. I could just shoot it too.

556
02:15:35,699 --> 02:15:41,529
You're out of the way.

557
02:15:50,279 --> 02:15:52,920
Once they've got the fire under control, we can check the rubble.

558
02:15:55,479 --> 02:16:24,119
Not yet. Save it. I've gone. I've been saving. Rats. Can I get through this? No. It's a wall.

559
02:16:33,670 --> 02:16:38,620
All right. Scary guy just jumps in the water. That means I have to jump in the water too. Or do I?

560
02:16:39,579 --> 02:16:45,450
I do not have to jump in the water. I get to bypass that whole segment.

561
02:16:47,000 --> 02:17:11,909
Let's spawn him anyways though. Never mind. Right. Okay. Three shots. One, two, three in the head.

562
02:17:11,909 --> 02:17:36,250
Here we go. He's going to get stuck to the ceiling. You motherfucker. I swear to God.

563
02:17:37,049 --> 02:17:59,030
I think that's it. Give me some more rail gun. Nice. All right. I ain't going to just sprint

564
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:05,750
over here because if there's one, there's two. If there's two, there's three. And if there's three,

565
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:26,680
there's 10. Kind of how this game has been working so far. All right. Is this in the

566
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:44,340
source engine? I don't think so. No, it's not. I don't know what this is in. It's probably like

567
02:18:44,340 --> 02:19:13,030
Unreal or something. One of the old Unreal's. Flashlight off. It's the boomer engine. Health

568
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:29,620
upgrade. Good. 120 max HP and a new health. All right. Cool. Damn it. I can't open that.

569
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:44,489
Come on. Got to go down here into the water. Fine. This way. This does remind me of Half-Life.

570
02:19:46,409 --> 02:19:59,370
Even just the sound effects too. That alarm sound. The going through the water sound. It has guns.

571
02:19:59,370 --> 02:20:03,850
Yeah. That's right. I didn't even think about that. Yeah. I didn't even think about that. It

572
02:20:03,850 --> 02:20:13,290
has guns. You're right. It's weird. It's got health glued to the wall. Wait. I ended up.

573
02:20:15,239 --> 02:20:23,959
All right. Fuck it. I don't care. Does that mean I can't go that way?

574
02:20:24,600 --> 02:20:50,309
Why do I feel like this is going to kill me? Shit. How did I go all the way back around?

575
02:20:51,979 --> 02:20:59,000
There is fall damage. What? Just run fast. Run fast.

576
02:21:28,899 --> 02:21:32,819
My body is exploding. It's disintegrating. So no, that's not how this works.

577
02:21:33,459 --> 02:21:39,930
Just use a health kit. Guys, I'm spamming T. It's not going to work. I'm out. I'm going that way.

578
02:21:40,649 --> 02:21:49,700
I will pick this up though. Shit. I went the wrong way.

579
02:21:54,809 --> 02:22:05,129
Back down here. Where did I go wrong? One of these big rooms back here.

580
02:22:08,120 --> 02:22:19,239
I shot the mines. Yeah. Yeah. I did. I didn't know it was going to cause electricity

581
02:22:19,239 --> 02:22:25,579
all over the place. Use a grenade and boost yourself. I don't think that's going to work.

582
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:36,729
This is where I remember this up. Should I go up here or should I go down there?

583
02:22:37,690 --> 02:22:57,479
I'm going to go up that way. I actually almost just made it. I almost just made it.

584
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:06,819
Okay. So there's a bottom there that there's no water underneath. It just goes all the way down.

585
02:23:06,819 --> 02:23:13,059
That's good to know. So you don't shortcut jump that just go around and go up. Very good to know.

586
02:23:20,620 --> 02:23:23,180
I'm not going to bunny hop through it. I'm going to go the right way.

587
02:23:24,459 --> 02:23:36,709
There's no bunny hopping in this game anyways. Why am I even trying? I know it doesn't exist.

588
02:23:36,709 --> 02:23:47,270
Why would I try it? See, I thought there was water here. Here we go. Ladder up this way.

589
02:23:47,270 --> 02:24:00,170
I didn't go up here. Maybe I did. Let's try it. Okay. And then is that the? Oh, here it is.

590
02:24:00,969 --> 02:24:11,930
I haven't. Okay. This is the electric. That's the electric. Oh no. The health kit. Oh, here we go.

591
02:24:13,700 --> 02:24:33,319
Solved it. Nice. All right. Let's keep going. 35 armor. Feels pumpkin man.

592
02:24:33,319 --> 02:24:38,069
Feels pumpkin man. What's feels pumpkin man? I can't see it.

593
02:24:45,559 --> 02:25:01,979
Okay. Mine's. Yeah, I do have a BTTV. The thing is though, I'm your chat right now is coming

594
02:25:01,979 --> 02:25:09,340
through Streamlabs. The Streamlabs OBS. So I don't know if I can have BTTV through Streamlabs.

595
02:25:10,899 --> 02:25:15,989
That's a new gun and there's more health. All right. New gun. What is this?

596
02:25:17,129 --> 02:25:27,239
ASP rifle. Oh, that's pretty great. Actually. I love that noise too. Perfect. All right. I don't

597
02:25:27,239 --> 02:25:37,270
need the assault rifle. I want this. How many bullets? 30, 15. Okay. Remote bomb. Remote bombs

598
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:41,270
stick to almost any surface, including enemies and can be manually detonated, making them ideal

599
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:48,090
for traps. Oh, don't do this to me. Don't give me this kind of shit. You don't want me to have this.

600
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:56,299
You sincerely do not want me to have this, but you gave it to me anyways. So

601
02:25:58,299 --> 02:26:11,989
I'm just going to use it immediately. Over here. Wait. I was already over here.

602
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:29,639
Is there a straight? Straight through here. I came up that way. So, huh. We're just downstairs.

603
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:37,239
Here comes the blew myself up joke. No, I'm not. I'm it's blow the other guy up joke.

604
02:26:37,239 --> 02:26:55,909
We've lost contact with the search team. How would you even see me?

605
02:26:57,750 --> 02:27:12,819
Is it playing the game that you don't throw with like that? That's just the detonator, but

606
02:27:16,120 --> 02:27:31,239
okay. I get it. I understand. I didn't. I thought you'd be like threw it with that or like,

607
02:27:31,239 --> 02:27:42,700
I get it. It's okay. Nice placement. Can I break this window without them freaking out about this?

608
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:52,629
I didn't do what? Let me check it out. You heard the wind.

609
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:16,360
It's not satisfied. I was not satisfying enough. I don't. That's a lot of people in there.

610
02:28:17,479 --> 02:28:44,969
That's pretty cool. Works pretty well. Pretty cool. So we get regular grenades. We have,

611
02:28:44,969 --> 02:28:56,069
okay. Do I have one regular grenade? Okay. Storm troopers. Their aim is sort of as bad as storm

612
02:28:56,069 --> 02:29:01,239
trooper. I want to try the sniper rifle. I'm going to snipe somebody. Who can I snipe? Right

613
02:29:01,239 --> 02:29:29,049
here. Nice. Should I go down? Ooh, there's more of this. Okay. So we need. I mean, I have.

614
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:41,690
That's what I currently have. More ammo for that thing. Pretty nice. Pretty nice. I wish it was

615
02:29:41,690 --> 02:29:49,590
only a one shot. I don't want the first. I only need is one bullet, not four, because it goes,

616
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:54,709
did it in, did it in, right? Did it in. What are they? What are they? What are they?

617
02:29:57,739 --> 02:30:08,260
Something like that. Let's see. What are they? That helicopter is huge.

618
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:26,629
You only dropped two. Why didn't like 10 people come out of there?

619
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:51,000
No, don't waste them. I'm up. I'm up close now. Get the shotgun hazard. I didn't even use the

620
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:33,909
hazard really. Nope. Nothing. How do you hear me? Where are they? Where is he?

621
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:46,649
Are they upstairs in the room? Movement. Who threw that?

622
02:31:52,329 --> 02:33:03,479
Is he dead? I am fucking around. Let's go. I'm no more screwing around. Wait for my signal. Yeah.

623
02:33:03,479 --> 02:33:34,260
It's called. You're dead. It was me. Oh, he fucking missed. Fail.

624
02:33:35,059 --> 02:34:42,409
Who the fuck are you? Oh, I got it. Come on. Did I get him? I couldn't even think about it.

625
02:34:42,409 --> 02:35:11,719
Where is he? It's right there. All right. Those guys are tricky. Those guys are hard.

626
02:35:11,719 --> 02:35:20,020
What else you got? Submachine gun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do I got? 25 shots.

627
02:35:21,819 --> 02:35:27,899
Bad. All right. I got three health packs. It's good. Not terrible. Not great. Not good either,

628
02:35:27,899 --> 02:35:39,260
though. That's where he came from. Very nice. Okay. You missed a health pack. Did I miss a health

629
02:35:39,260 --> 02:36:00,729
pack? Where do you see that? Oh, oh, you got baited. Baited. I don't think I did. I think I'm

630
02:36:00,729 --> 02:36:20,469
doing just fine. All right. Straight through. My point man's current position.

631
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:31,100
Problem is there's an enemy gunship sitting there at the moment. Oh shit. Thanks. Nice. Okay. Turn

632
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:39,260
the light off. 70. Ooh. That's exactly what I want. Got 45 in this now. I'm going to use the

633
02:36:39,260 --> 02:36:46,120
shotgun. Yeah. Shotguns. Look at those ammo. That's way too much ammo. Comcast. Yeah. That's right.

634
02:36:46,120 --> 02:36:59,079
Sounds like they're saying. All right. Uh, good. We're good. We're good. Save it. Someone's going

635
02:36:59,079 --> 02:37:17,719
to pop around the corner. I'm not going to shoot him right in the face. Or not. This is going to

636
02:37:17,719 --> 02:37:38,469
alert people. Just don't just walk. You can make it in there. You seriously can. You really can. I

637
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:58,440
know you can get in there. You can fit inside of that. You are not as big as this. I don't want

638
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:16,040
that though. No, I like what I have right now. Helicopter battle. Looks like it. I'll put you

639
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:45,850
can go through that. Right. You can go through that. Uh, nine shots in this. Hey, what? Nice aim.

640
02:38:45,850 --> 02:39:51,239
Idiot. Oh no. Not another one. Okay. I need. Is that a person? No. Run away. NA aim. NA aim.

641
02:39:51,239 --> 02:40:24,200
Explosives. I have one of these. Okay. I'm going to use this one first. Did I not throw it far

642
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:34,709
enough? Why do you have so much HP? It's just not even fair to us that don't have those suits.

643
02:40:50,440 --> 02:41:12,540
Oh, I just panicked and had to try. Okay. I have to replace something. Maybe not. Did I do it?

644
02:41:12,540 --> 02:41:29,590
This is the, oh, that's the evac point. Interval four.

645
02:41:37,190 --> 02:41:42,469
How do I like the game so far? It's good. It's fun just to shoot and there's some weird stuff going on.

646
02:41:44,069 --> 02:42:01,979
Look at that water. It is pretty beautiful. Drop the scope gun. Ammo forward is too scarce

647
02:42:01,979 --> 02:42:06,940
for it to be viable. Yeah. I guess, you know, that's probably true considering

648
02:42:08,620 --> 02:42:11,899
when you, it's not like it's that big of a difference.

649
02:42:13,659 --> 02:42:21,379
Really guys. Really? What? Okay. That was a little.

650
02:42:21,379 --> 02:42:49,049
That guy has three in his head. He has three in his head. Why are you still alive?

651
02:42:51,930 --> 02:43:14,600
Holy shit. You are a maniac. This is the kind of shit that happens to people in BR,

652
02:43:14,600 --> 02:43:18,600
like in Fortnite and shit. You're just jumping around trying to get that and,

653
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:27,079
oh, I just got fortnighted. I got like, what? How did I insta fucking die?

654
02:43:27,079 --> 02:43:46,700
Why? That guy's not dead. Can we be clear about that? He was still alive.

655
02:44:14,629 --> 02:44:20,420
I thought it was going to bounce back. I had this, I was just being a cameraman. I'm sorry.

656
02:44:20,979 --> 02:44:39,930
He's got it out. Instantly killing me.

657
02:44:40,889 --> 02:44:56,969
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Okay. I need to pay. Okay. This is,

658
02:44:57,690 --> 02:45:03,059
I'm going to run. I'm going. Here's the plan. You ready? Watch this.

659
02:45:08,809 --> 02:45:17,530
Oh, this is not the shotgun. Oh shit.

660
02:45:17,530 --> 02:47:00,659
Where is he? Fuck. Where'd he go? Whoa. He fell off the edge. Oh shit. I got him. Okay.

661
02:47:00,659 --> 02:47:08,649
Um, I need to tap a new gun or something. What's this? Oh, that's a nice one. No,

662
02:47:08,649 --> 02:47:29,350
it's one I just threw over here. Okay. I'm going to save it here. I have no health.

663
02:47:29,350 --> 02:47:51,270
Is he going to do it? What do you think? No, he's not. We need 20 more. Oh shit.

664
02:47:51,270 --> 02:48:00,569
I don't think we need more than those. Pre-recorded. What'd it say? Pre-recorded.

665
02:48:00,569 --> 02:49:00,579
Bleach. Oh, no. All right. I don't want to make noise and stay down. Health. Nice. 130.

666
02:49:00,579 --> 02:49:24,340
I feel like you were waiting for me. 200 is max. That makes sense. Watch out for that gas.

667
02:49:36,760 --> 02:50:03,299
What did he just throw? Check it. All right. What, what did you, did you pre-fire me? Okay.

668
02:50:03,299 --> 02:50:21,290
Guys, I, he's, he's pre, just kill me. I'll do it again. Where should I go? I love it. He's just

669
02:50:21,290 --> 02:50:27,209
holding down the trigger on me, screaming, where should I go? I'm so scared. This guy's

670
02:50:27,209 --> 02:50:32,680
fucking terrifying. If the grenade throw, if the grenade pops up here, I'm going to be very mad.

671
02:50:35,959 --> 02:51:23,899
All right. There's no grenade. Oh shit. That's so funny. This bitch jumps at like, like 10%.

672
02:51:23,899 --> 02:51:40,860
Dude, dude pulls out a shotgun. Oh shit. He gets his fucking face blown off. The guy next to him.

673
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:51,799
Oh shit. Oh, this game's fucking awesome. Oh, that's fucking real. That's just really stupid.

674
02:51:52,899 --> 02:52:28,059
That's really stupid. Oh, okay. Hold on. I have to compose myself here. Let's get this together.

675
02:52:34,329 --> 02:52:44,280
I was hoping he was going to say, oh shit. Oh shit.

676
02:52:50,219 --> 02:53:13,290
I don't know why it's making me laugh so bad right now. What is he aiming at?

677
02:53:14,010 --> 02:53:33,370
I just got, I get stuck on something and I can't, I can't get away from it.

678
02:53:53,989 --> 02:54:12,389
Why wouldn't you do anything? Protect yourself. Okay. He was scared.

679
02:54:25,959 --> 02:54:51,909
Whoa. I held the button for too long. You guys are played, uh, smash TV.

680
02:54:53,030 --> 02:55:23,899
He's not going to use the stairs. It reminds me of the, no way. No way. That game is so good.

681
02:55:23,899 --> 02:55:51,030
I should play that game on stream. I'm starting to kind of lose it. It's too ridiculous sometimes.

682
02:55:51,270 --> 02:56:06,459
You got mortal combated. Yeah. He did like a high punch, mid kick, high punch, mid kick. He was

683
02:56:06,459 --> 02:56:11,610
trying to do a combo. So yeah, it's all right. It's okay. Sometimes you mess up the, mess up the

684
02:56:11,610 --> 02:56:39,500
button combos. He was trying to do like the sub zero freeze. I don't. That's true. You do have that

685
02:56:40,379 --> 02:57:02,700
right. Okay. Let's, oh, save it. All right. I'm good. Two health packs. What's with this?

686
02:57:02,700 --> 02:57:18,500
Here comes the music. What's with the, here comes the music. A lot of people out there.

687
02:57:47,319 --> 02:57:59,319
Good. Can somebody, can I watch that clip? Can somebody cut the, oh shit. Oh shit. It's,

688
02:57:59,399 --> 02:58:05,610
it won't get out of my head. I just, I need to see it again. I don't care about anything

689
02:58:05,610 --> 02:58:15,180
else right now. I just want to see it again. Like you get, you can watch it like on your own time.

690
02:58:15,180 --> 02:58:55,350
I just, I need to see it again. It's funny. Okay. I just want to remind myself if it's funny or not.

691
02:59:01,059 --> 02:59:08,469
All right. I just needed to, sometimes you need to be reminded if it was funny. Okay. So

692
02:59:09,430 --> 02:59:18,629
I'm going to go up this way. Darn it. Darn it. Healing sticks.

693
02:59:24,469 --> 02:59:33,340
Wait a minute. Oh, through the glass. I need to jump through the glass.

694
02:59:38,340 --> 03:00:24,659
I did this already. How did I, I hold up the sign that says, uh-oh. And then I fall. Locate

695
03:00:24,659 --> 03:00:32,100
and reset the network. I'll try. I need healing. I need healing very, very badly.

696
03:00:32,819 --> 03:00:42,379
Oops. Now no one will ever get into the network. Okay. You got to wedge it with something.

697
03:00:43,100 --> 03:00:47,959
Just stick something in there. I got to wedge something in there. First of all,

698
03:00:47,959 --> 03:00:59,340
let's get some refreshments. I don't think there is any refreshments. No, there is not.

699
03:00:59,979 --> 03:01:19,500
Somebody in here watching this. Okay. That's pretty, that's pretty funny. That's pretty great.

700
03:01:19,500 --> 03:01:31,180
It actually moves the projector around too. That's, I love it. That's great.

701
03:01:31,899 --> 03:01:55,180
This is, that's highly detailed for 2004. Hey, open this. No, not, not if I can be open until

702
03:01:55,180 --> 03:02:16,680
the network's back online. Anything in here? Health pack. Nothing. When there are horror

703
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:54,809
game like this, we walked around in the office. Oh shit. Stay out of my way. What is up above here?

704
03:02:54,809 --> 03:03:01,780
Oh, computer. The data is uploading now. There's a reference of something called Icarus. It says

705
03:03:01,780 --> 03:03:06,979
here that it was a bioengineering program that started in 1973. Something about health issues

706
03:03:06,979 --> 03:03:11,459
related to microgravity, loss of muscle mass, bone density, shit like that.

707
03:03:12,500 --> 03:03:23,379
Well, it's shit. Okay. Oh, I mean, it's the other side. Okay.

708
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:33,420
Assault rifle. I was, I've talked a lot of shit about how much health I had and how many health

709
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:39,739
packs I had. And now that I switched over to hard mode, I've not had as many health packs. They,

710
03:03:40,219 --> 03:04:01,799
spawn less. Enemies take more damage. It's a lot harder. Nope. I was going to say it's going to

711
03:04:01,799 --> 03:04:14,520
open up and scream. I knew it. I fucking knew. I told you, I knew that shit was going to happen.

712
03:04:15,399 --> 03:04:24,379
Fucking Venetian blinds. I'm telling you, they're the worst invention in history.

713
03:04:25,899 --> 03:04:34,069
I will never have Venetian blinds in my house. I don't understand why you want these huge,

714
03:04:34,870 --> 03:04:38,950
obnoxious pillars that get in the way of everything you do when you open a door.

715
03:04:39,940 --> 03:04:47,290
Why are they still putting these in houses? Why? Everybody hates them. Every single person hates

716
03:04:47,290 --> 03:04:54,940
these things. Ask anybody that has them. Oh, yeah. They suck ass. Oh, okay. Why are they in your

717
03:04:54,940 --> 03:05:08,010
house? I don't know. Get a curtain. No, I don't want to get a curtain. That means I have to

718
03:05:08,729 --> 03:05:13,690
go to the Home Depot and get a curtain and put it up. I'll just deal with the,

719
03:05:14,250 --> 03:05:17,690
like the swinging pendulums of death every time I open my slider.

720
03:05:25,819 --> 03:06:01,100
How do you leave a voicemail on a public phone? Later. The glossy TV. You should get a matte TV.

721
03:06:01,100 --> 03:06:07,100
Never buy a glossy TV. And if anyone wants to argue with glossy screen versus matte screen,

722
03:06:07,899 --> 03:06:13,100
I'm sorry, but you're going to lose every time. I will win that argument every single time.

723
03:06:13,739 --> 03:06:32,979
Oh, it's a satellite. Okay. How many, what do I have? Three. Okay. I have four. I have three grenades

724
03:06:32,979 --> 03:06:50,040
and let's get the shotgun out. Comes a jumpscare. No, no jumpscare in here. That's strange. I would

725
03:06:50,040 --> 03:07:08,200
have thought it would be. What's that? All right. I thought that was this gun. Hello? I'm walking.

726
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:32,700
Stop walking. I'm freaking out right now. Okay. Just don't kill me. Kill me. That was bullshit.

727
03:07:32,700 --> 03:08:01,420
I'll do it. That was terrifying. I'll be ready this time. That's like, what?

728
03:08:03,020 --> 03:08:10,969
This is unbelievable. There's no way I'm visible. Well, they're in the game now. That's great. I

729
03:08:10,969 --> 03:08:39,860
can't wait to deal with that. Look for the little wiggly lines. Dead. Place to go up there. Can I

730
03:08:39,860 --> 03:09:25,239
jump up that? No, I can't. Got him. If you only knew how to defeat me. Chuck Hamburger?

731
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:52,969
So we've got, nice. Good. We've got a, I've got to go up somehow.

732
03:10:53,770 --> 03:11:02,420
I have to go up that shaft over here. How am I going to do that? Is there another way to get up

733
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:19,180
there? Can I, I guess I could just go through here. All right. Be ready because I'm trying to

734
03:11:19,180 --> 03:11:24,780
put the nail in the guy's head. I see electricity. That's what, I know what that means. There's

735
03:11:24,780 --> 03:11:54,440
electricity. He's running above me. I don't know why that scared me. I don't know. I was ready for

736
03:11:54,440 --> 03:12:24,040
it, but it still did it. I don't know why. Why is this opening? Oh, look, look. It's an, it's office

737
03:12:24,040 --> 03:12:38,409
space. TPS report. Red stapler. What's this say? November. Oh me. That's an office space

738
03:12:38,409 --> 03:12:44,250
reference. That's a pretty good movie too. Never seen office space. Go watch it. Right now. Just

739
03:12:44,250 --> 03:13:35,989
go get it. What? I think grenades. Don't touch that dial. We're just getting started. Thanks.

740
03:13:35,989 --> 03:13:59,100
Appreciate the feedback. What the fuck was that? What's wrong with me? Why is everything all spooky?

741
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:18,979
Show yourself. That's all it took is right in the stomach. All right.

742
03:14:20,340 --> 03:14:39,100
Shotgun is way better for these guys. You just plant one right in the face. I thought that was a

743
03:14:39,100 --> 03:14:57,540
mine. Computer. Ooh. All right. He's uploading. Looks like the Icarus program got shut down in

744
03:14:57,540 --> 03:15:02,819
favor of something called Perseus, which from what I can tell is funded by DMZ. I'm guessing that's

745
03:15:02,819 --> 03:15:35,079
where Fettel had been sold. Server room. I can't go in server room. Guy live. Hello. That's silent

746
03:15:35,079 --> 03:15:58,459
in here. Why? Oh you piece of shit. Where are you? Bye. Where's he? Don't shoot. It's Norton

747
03:15:58,459 --> 03:16:21,590
Mapes. I'm an engineer. What? Give him a comm link. Hello. This is a human Garfield. I'm having a

748
03:16:21,590 --> 03:16:31,100
hell of a time. He said you're an engineer. Tell you what. You disable the local security system

749
03:16:31,100 --> 03:16:36,379
and I'll see what I can do about the server. I can disable it remotely once I'm locked in.

750
03:16:36,379 --> 03:16:50,549
No, you can't. It's on a separate network. To bring down the security system anyway.

751
03:16:53,620 --> 03:16:59,940
It's happened. You want my help? That's the price. What's going on? He's eating the grenades.

752
03:17:07,579 --> 03:17:24,059
What else does he eat? Will you eat anything else? Whoa. Wait, hold on. Just wait here.

753
03:17:25,020 --> 03:17:41,350
Okay. Back up. That's the price. Okay. That's it. We're good. Just wait here.

754
03:17:44,709 --> 03:17:57,450
He's just an NPC. Whoops. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it. Restart it.

755
03:17:59,129 --> 03:18:18,260
Uh oh. Human. I can't believe human Garfield. That's sad. You want my help? That's the price.

756
03:18:18,899 --> 03:18:34,680
Okay. What does he want? Just wait here. What's he eating? Those are Cheetos. He's actually eating

757
03:18:34,680 --> 03:18:41,540
Cheetos. That's fantastic. That's the best character. I wish I could play as that character.

758
03:18:42,950 --> 03:19:01,079
I feel so much more at home. Human Garfield. That's so funny. Scary. Dark hallway. Don't want

759
03:19:01,079 --> 03:19:17,430
to go down there yet. Don't do that. Okay. This is his desk. Oh god. Look at this, like,

760
03:19:17,430 --> 03:19:25,430
gamer chair. Look at this gamer setup. They don't even make Cheetos bags this big.

761
03:19:26,069 --> 03:19:34,739
That's bigger than the monitor. This is like a 24 inch size Cheetos bag. They don't even make

762
03:19:34,739 --> 03:20:15,290
these. Well, let's listen to the message. I just want to shatter his computer so he freaks out.

763
03:20:18,090 --> 03:20:20,329
You know he's had that monitor for like 15 years.

764
03:20:35,319 --> 03:20:42,420
All right. Let's do some sneaking around and actually stealth kill people.

765
03:20:44,020 --> 03:21:24,170
I wish I had a little map with a radar. Okay. So far so good. This is it. Let's try to get a clean...

766
03:21:24,809 --> 03:21:47,909
I mean. I wish I had a silenced gun. Who's down? Am I down here? I mean,

767
03:21:47,909 --> 03:22:19,719
how did you know I was up there in the first place? Holy shit. What was that?

768
03:22:19,719 --> 03:22:36,540
What's that?

769
03:22:36,540 --> 03:22:39,799
You see him?

770
03:22:39,799 --> 03:22:41,799
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

771
03:23:06,180 --> 03:23:10,899
What? Bullshit.

772
03:23:10,899 --> 03:23:14,790
Bullshit.

773
03:23:14,790 --> 03:23:16,790
Alright, that's it.

774
03:23:16,790 --> 03:23:18,790
I've had just about enough of this shit.

775
03:23:18,790 --> 03:23:20,790
I've had just about enough of this.

776
03:23:20,790 --> 03:23:25,780
Wrong button.

777
03:23:25,780 --> 03:23:29,239
Whatever, just die.

778
03:23:29,239 --> 03:23:31,239
Are you really throwing a grenade?

779
03:23:31,239 --> 03:23:36,280
I thought he was

780
03:23:36,280 --> 03:23:38,280
Like, I'm gonna do it.

781
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:50,059
I'm getting ready.

782
03:23:50,059 --> 03:23:53,639
There, right there.

783
03:23:53,639 --> 03:23:55,639
Right there, right there.

784
03:23:55,639 --> 03:24:13,290
What was that? Did he fall?

785
03:24:13,290 --> 03:24:15,290
Who's fucking tripping around?

786
03:24:34,149 --> 03:24:38,819
Clean. Clean.

787
03:24:38,819 --> 03:24:40,819
Very clean.

788
03:24:40,819 --> 03:24:50,489
Okay, healing.

789
03:24:50,489 --> 03:24:53,559
What else we got? Nothing else here.

790
03:24:53,559 --> 03:24:57,459
I'll take the

791
03:24:57,459 --> 03:24:59,459
I'll take the shotgun and the shells.

792
03:24:59,459 --> 03:25:01,959
We good, we good.

793
03:25:01,959 --> 03:25:10,920
Armor.

794
03:25:10,920 --> 03:25:16,739
Nice.

795
03:25:16,739 --> 03:25:18,739
117 shots in this thing.

796
03:25:18,739 --> 03:25:21,879
That's pretty good.

797
03:25:21,879 --> 03:25:23,879
Oh damn, alright.

798
03:25:23,879 --> 03:25:30,469
Decision time.

799
03:25:30,469 --> 03:25:38,090
Wait, what the? Grenades?

800
03:25:38,090 --> 03:25:40,389
Shotgun.

801
03:25:40,389 --> 03:25:42,389
And then I have

802
03:25:42,389 --> 03:25:44,389
Do I have full ammo with this?

803
03:25:44,389 --> 03:25:47,209
I think so.

804
03:25:47,209 --> 03:25:50,090
Actually, it wasn't really that cool.

805
03:25:50,090 --> 03:25:54,120
Oh well.

806
03:25:54,120 --> 03:25:56,120
I have full ammo for everything.

807
03:25:56,120 --> 03:25:59,190
Good. What's that?

808
03:25:59,190 --> 03:26:04,739
Activate.

809
03:26:04,739 --> 03:26:06,739
Got it.

810
03:26:17,139 --> 03:26:19,639
Locate and reset the network hub.

811
03:26:19,639 --> 03:26:21,639
I will try.

812
03:26:21,639 --> 03:26:24,069
Server room is down here.

813
03:26:24,069 --> 03:26:26,819
Right?

814
03:26:26,819 --> 03:26:33,930
Where was it?

815
03:26:33,930 --> 03:26:35,930
Where was the server room?

816
03:26:35,930 --> 03:26:43,780
Back here?

817
03:26:43,780 --> 03:26:45,780
There's a label. Server room.

818
03:26:45,780 --> 03:26:49,049
Come on in.

819
03:26:49,049 --> 03:26:54,549
Back at the beginning?

820
03:26:54,549 --> 03:27:09,059
Target.

821
03:27:09,059 --> 03:27:11,059
Target.

822
03:27:11,059 --> 03:27:14,840
Get that open.

823
03:27:31,159 --> 03:27:39,799
What?

824
03:27:41,799 --> 03:27:47,239
I'm not using this gun.

825
03:27:47,239 --> 03:27:58,760
I'm using a shotgun from down the hall.

826
03:28:01,579 --> 03:28:07,850
Server room. There we go.

827
03:28:07,850 --> 03:28:09,850
Alright, save it. Now...

828
03:28:16,329 --> 03:28:18,329
Wait, hold on.

829
03:28:18,329 --> 03:28:27,350
Let me go in here first.

830
03:28:27,350 --> 03:28:34,840
Alright, that hurt.

831
03:28:34,840 --> 03:28:38,229
Reboot the network.

832
03:28:38,229 --> 03:28:41,750
One, two, three, go!

833
03:28:47,879 --> 03:28:49,879
Did Jerma find the fat guy?

834
03:28:49,879 --> 03:29:08,379
He did it!

835
03:29:08,379 --> 03:29:17,909
He set it!

836
03:29:17,909 --> 03:29:19,909
Okay. I gotta find the status of this person?

837
03:29:19,909 --> 03:29:22,659
I guess.

838
03:29:22,659 --> 03:29:27,719
There's seven shots in this thing.

839
03:29:27,719 --> 03:29:29,719
That's not gonna cut it.

840
03:29:29,719 --> 03:29:37,340
Make that a sub sound.

841
03:29:37,340 --> 03:29:43,750
I can plan under the camera feed, but I don't have any direct access to the system.

842
03:29:43,750 --> 03:29:47,590
Shoot.

843
03:29:47,590 --> 03:29:49,899
Wait.

844
03:29:49,899 --> 03:29:54,489
There's no sub sound?

845
03:29:54,489 --> 03:29:56,489
Yeah, I kind of muted it.

846
03:29:56,489 --> 03:29:58,489
After a while.

847
03:29:58,489 --> 03:30:08,340
Scary!

848
03:30:14,809 --> 03:30:16,809
It's a really fun thing.

849
03:30:16,809 --> 03:30:19,110
It's a really cool thing.

850
03:30:19,110 --> 03:30:21,610
Sometimes if you think about it...

851
03:30:21,610 --> 03:30:23,610
Let's say there's a bunch of subs.

852
03:30:23,610 --> 03:30:27,610
Let's say there's a ton of community subs and a bunch of subs.

853
03:30:27,610 --> 03:30:29,610
It's almost like you constantly have...

854
03:30:29,610 --> 03:30:31,610
every like...

855
03:30:31,610 --> 03:30:33,610
two minutes or every one minute...

856
03:30:33,610 --> 03:30:35,610
just a noise that's just like...

857
03:30:35,610 --> 03:30:38,420
Hey, keep a track of my head!

858
03:30:38,420 --> 03:30:40,600
Boink!

859
03:30:40,600 --> 03:30:42,600
Hey, keep a track of my head!

860
03:30:42,600 --> 03:30:44,600
Boink!

861
03:30:44,600 --> 03:30:46,600
Hey, keep a track of my head!

862
03:30:46,600 --> 03:30:48,600
Boink!

863
03:30:48,600 --> 03:30:50,600
And that shit happens for fucking seven straight hours.

864
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:52,600
And that shit happens for fucking seven straight hours.

865
03:30:52,600 --> 03:30:54,600
You know how easily distracted I am?

866
03:30:54,600 --> 03:30:56,600
You know how easily distracted I am?

867
03:30:56,600 --> 03:30:58,969
It's very, very easy.

868
03:30:58,969 --> 03:31:00,969
Hold on, this is...

869
03:31:00,969 --> 03:31:02,969
Hold on, this is Laura going around right now.

870
03:31:02,969 --> 03:31:09,479
Full health.

871
03:31:09,479 --> 03:31:15,110
Don't do noise, just the banner?

872
03:31:15,110 --> 03:31:17,110
The banner should be on.

873
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:19,290
It's not because of this. Hold on.

874
03:31:19,290 --> 03:31:21,290
The banner should actually...

875
03:31:21,290 --> 03:31:23,780
The banner should still be there.

876
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:26,149
But it's because I had to capture this strangely.

877
03:31:26,149 --> 03:31:30,700
It should be there.

878
03:31:30,700 --> 03:31:45,100
It should be there now.

879
03:31:45,100 --> 03:32:00,200
Unknown origin.

880
03:32:00,200 --> 03:32:05,059
This room's on fire.

881
03:32:05,059 --> 03:32:07,819
I don't...

882
03:32:07,819 --> 03:32:19,850
Why are you running at me?

883
03:32:19,850 --> 03:32:31,559
I'm fine.

884
03:32:31,559 --> 03:32:33,559
Something is right next to me.

885
03:32:33,559 --> 03:32:35,559
Something is right next to me.

886
03:32:42,700 --> 03:32:44,940
I'm here!

887
03:32:44,940 --> 03:33:06,739
Hey, I'm here!

888
03:33:06,739 --> 03:33:10,139
Hey, guys.

889
03:33:10,139 --> 03:33:12,139
There was a lot of anger in this room.

890
03:33:12,139 --> 03:33:14,870
Great. Better to be useful.

891
03:33:14,870 --> 03:33:17,879
I don't see any bullet holes.

892
03:33:17,879 --> 03:33:19,879
There's no brass lying around either.

893
03:33:19,879 --> 03:33:21,879
These guys didn't fire a shot.

894
03:33:21,879 --> 03:33:23,879
Then what killed them?

895
03:33:23,879 --> 03:33:26,420
I don't know.

896
03:33:26,420 --> 03:33:28,420
Figure it out.

897
03:33:28,420 --> 03:33:30,420
Alright, buddy, get moving. Fettel's gotta be close.

898
03:33:30,420 --> 03:33:32,420
I'm not even sure where to start.

899
03:33:32,420 --> 03:33:34,420
Continue the search for Paxton Fettel.

900
03:33:34,420 --> 03:33:37,180
Almost complete liquefaction.

901
03:33:37,180 --> 03:33:39,350
Liquefaction?

902
03:33:39,350 --> 03:33:42,299
Maybe a chemical agent?

903
03:33:42,299 --> 03:33:45,370
Hmm.

904
03:33:45,370 --> 03:33:47,370
It could be a grenade.

905
03:33:47,370 --> 03:33:53,260
This is going to take some time.

906
03:33:53,260 --> 03:33:55,260
Did you take photos of the ground?

907
03:33:55,260 --> 03:34:04,020
What are you doing?

908
03:34:04,020 --> 03:34:08,059
You're going to delete a lot of those.

909
03:34:08,059 --> 03:34:10,059
That's why I don't...

910
03:34:10,059 --> 03:34:12,059
Guys, people ask me.

911
03:34:12,059 --> 03:34:14,059
Dude, you don't take any pictures of your phone.

912
03:34:14,059 --> 03:34:16,059
Why don't you take photos?

913
03:34:16,059 --> 03:34:18,059
I take one photo when I know I want to take a photo.

914
03:34:18,059 --> 03:34:20,059
When I know I need to take a photo.

915
03:34:20,059 --> 03:34:22,059
I do not take

916
03:34:22,059 --> 03:34:24,059
15 or 20 pictures of the same thing.

917
03:34:24,059 --> 03:34:26,059
I get it right the first time.

918
03:34:26,059 --> 03:34:28,360
Because then when you...

919
03:34:28,360 --> 03:34:30,360
If you take like 20 pictures of something you think is interesting.

920
03:34:30,360 --> 03:34:32,360
You end up...

921
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:34,360
You don't even think about it.

922
03:34:34,360 --> 03:34:36,360
You don't go back and look at those pictures.

923
03:34:36,360 --> 03:34:38,360
Maybe for potentially months and months and months.

924
03:34:38,360 --> 03:34:40,360
You'll go to like...

925
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,360
The Smithsonian.

926
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:44,360
And you'll take a picture of like a space shuttle.

927
03:34:44,360 --> 03:34:46,360
Oh wow, that's so cool.

928
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:48,360
The space shuttle, that's awesome.

929
03:34:48,360 --> 03:34:50,360
That's really fucking interesting.

930
03:34:50,360 --> 03:34:52,360
And then two years goes by.

931
03:34:52,360 --> 03:34:54,360
And you have like 16 different

932
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:56,360
stupid angles of

933
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:58,360
the same space shuttle in the Smithsonian.

934
03:34:58,360 --> 03:35:00,360
And your phone is at like

935
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:02,360
99% capacity.

936
03:35:02,360 --> 03:35:04,360
And you go, fuck, let's just go back.

937
03:35:04,360 --> 03:35:06,360
And that's like 1600 photos.

938
03:35:06,360 --> 03:35:08,360
I guess I'm going to go back and delete all these.

939
03:35:08,360 --> 03:35:10,360
Take one.

940
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:13,479
Just one.

941
03:35:13,479 --> 03:35:15,479
Get a good one.

942
03:35:15,479 --> 03:35:17,479
One that you remember.

943
03:35:17,479 --> 03:35:19,659
You don't have to go like...

944
03:35:19,659 --> 03:35:22,020
Hold on.

945
03:35:22,020 --> 03:35:24,969
I want to also do...

946
03:35:24,969 --> 03:35:45,239
Should I? Oh.

947
03:35:45,239 --> 03:35:48,569
It's not my hand.

948
03:35:48,569 --> 03:35:50,569
Just a bug.

949
03:35:50,569 --> 03:35:54,600
Damn it, my fucking stupid ass thing

950
03:35:54,600 --> 03:35:57,159
didn't work.

951
03:35:57,159 --> 03:35:59,159
Come on. Really?

952
03:35:59,159 --> 03:36:05,430
Do these not break? It would have been fucking funny

953
03:36:05,430 --> 03:36:11,639
if I did it the first time.

954
03:36:11,639 --> 03:36:13,940
It's one of those things. Where is it though?

955
03:36:13,940 --> 03:36:35,940
Full health.

956
03:36:35,940 --> 03:36:38,309
Let's go. Watch out.

957
03:36:38,309 --> 03:36:40,309
They're going to spawn.

958
03:36:40,309 --> 03:36:42,309
They're just throwing...

959
03:36:42,309 --> 03:36:44,309
There's a health pack in every single room.

960
03:36:44,309 --> 03:36:46,309
In this level.

961
03:37:12,360 --> 03:37:21,059
Come on.

962
03:37:21,059 --> 03:37:27,530
Holy shit, that's too many people.

963
03:37:27,530 --> 03:37:29,530
Okay, there's a lot of people in there. We gotta change tactics.

964
03:37:29,530 --> 03:37:32,729
I gotta pick them off one by one.

965
03:37:32,729 --> 03:37:34,729
Sniping style.

966
03:37:44,260 --> 03:37:46,260
You walked in front of them.

967
03:37:46,260 --> 03:37:48,260
And said, oh shit.

968
03:37:51,850 --> 03:37:53,850
Like, seriously.

969
03:37:53,850 --> 03:37:55,850
You've got a guy fight. Imagine there's a guy

970
03:37:55,850 --> 03:37:57,850
right here shooting.

971
03:37:57,850 --> 03:37:59,850
This guy just goes like this.

972
03:37:59,850 --> 03:38:01,850
Like the chair is fighting you.

973
03:38:06,010 --> 03:38:12,409
Oh shit.

974
03:38:12,409 --> 03:38:14,409
How does he know he's

975
03:38:14,409 --> 03:38:16,840
in your crosshairs?

976
03:38:16,840 --> 03:38:18,840
Oh shit. I'm going to get like

977
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:20,840
right inside of your...

978
03:38:20,840 --> 03:38:23,020
aim down sights.

979
03:38:23,020 --> 03:38:25,020
I know he's looking at me now. I shouldn't have walked

980
03:38:25,020 --> 03:38:27,020
in front of my colleague who's also

981
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:29,020
shooting. I made so many

982
03:38:29,020 --> 03:38:31,020
mistakes in a row.

983
03:38:31,020 --> 03:38:34,659
Wait, I can't hear.

984
03:38:34,659 --> 03:38:56,469
Say it.

985
03:38:56,469 --> 03:39:10,940
Say it. Say the line.

986
03:39:10,940 --> 03:39:12,940
Say the line.

987
03:39:12,940 --> 03:39:15,430
Alright, it's time to stop fucking around.

988
03:39:15,430 --> 03:39:17,430
Watch this one. Activate.

989
03:40:07,459 --> 03:40:12,969
Okay, we're good.

990
03:40:12,969 --> 03:40:30,100
I'm going to use shitties?

991
03:40:30,100 --> 03:40:40,469
I just frogged that computer.

992
03:40:40,469 --> 03:41:41,579
Alright, I got plenty of ammo. Shotgun?

993
03:41:41,579 --> 03:41:43,879
Is that a different shotgun? I don't think so.

994
03:42:42,100 --> 03:42:45,239
No, you can't apparently.

995
03:42:56,250 --> 03:42:58,250
Hell!

996
03:42:58,250 --> 03:43:00,250
What's up?

997
03:43:00,250 --> 03:43:02,250
I'm trying, man.

998
03:43:11,459 --> 03:43:16,700
Here.

999
03:43:20,700 --> 03:43:22,700
Sauer Tower?

1000
03:43:22,700 --> 03:43:45,909
Bye.

1001
03:43:45,909 --> 03:43:48,790
Do what? Okay, go to the elevators.

1002
03:43:48,790 --> 03:43:55,899
I'm really trying to put on

1003
03:43:55,899 --> 03:43:57,899
a good display of video gaming skill.

1004
03:43:57,899 --> 03:43:59,899
I had to just blink my eyes a few times.

1005
03:43:59,899 --> 03:44:06,170
I'm still in it too.

1006
03:44:06,170 --> 03:44:08,170
I'm still in that zone. It's going to happen.

1007
03:44:08,170 --> 03:44:16,040
Elevators.

1008
03:44:18,040 --> 03:44:20,040
Are they?

1009
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:22,040
Oh, it feels bad for them.

1010
03:44:22,040 --> 03:44:28,700
It feels bad for them.

1011
03:44:30,700 --> 03:44:36,520
Oh, boy. Your head.

1012
03:44:47,510 --> 03:44:49,510
It's no fair.

1013
03:44:51,690 --> 03:44:53,690
They didn't get...

1014
03:44:53,690 --> 03:45:06,360
No!

1015
03:45:06,360 --> 03:45:08,360
We had an opportunity!

1016
03:45:08,360 --> 03:45:10,360
We had an oh shit opportunity!

1017
03:45:10,360 --> 03:45:12,360
It's over!

1018
03:45:12,360 --> 03:45:28,299
I just burped.

1019
03:45:34,950 --> 03:45:38,790
Oh, boy.

1020
03:45:38,790 --> 03:45:40,790
He just got compressed in the elevator.

1021
03:45:50,139 --> 03:45:52,139
I'm not supposed to...

1022
03:45:52,139 --> 03:45:54,139
I'm trying to stifle laughter because I'm like...

1023
03:45:59,450 --> 03:46:01,450
I'm on like medication right now.

1024
03:46:03,450 --> 03:46:05,450
From my stomach.

1025
03:46:05,450 --> 03:46:07,450
And it's like making me very, very tender.

1026
03:46:07,450 --> 03:46:09,450
And sensitive.

1027
03:46:09,450 --> 03:46:11,450
And sore and shit.

1028
03:46:11,450 --> 03:46:13,620
And I...

1029
03:46:13,620 --> 03:46:16,440
I didn't think this game was going to be...

1030
03:46:19,579 --> 03:46:31,930
What?

1031
03:46:31,930 --> 03:46:35,899
You guys didn't think I could pick up a free one?

1032
03:46:35,899 --> 03:46:42,170
What? Ooh.

1033
03:46:42,170 --> 03:46:44,170
Oh, shit!

1034
03:46:44,170 --> 03:46:48,840
Where is the hostage?

1035
03:46:48,840 --> 03:46:53,260
Oh, right. He's down here.

1036
03:46:53,260 --> 03:46:55,260
Where is he? I don't remember. He's over here somewhere.

1037
03:46:55,260 --> 03:46:59,030
Can somebody turn this on?

1038
03:46:59,030 --> 03:47:01,030
I don't know how to get over there.

1039
03:47:01,030 --> 03:47:06,340
Just... There.

1040
03:47:06,340 --> 03:47:14,219
Through the wall that we explored.

1041
03:47:14,219 --> 03:47:17,350
These guys are both dead, by the way.

1042
03:47:17,350 --> 03:47:19,350
This is going to be a...

1043
03:47:19,350 --> 03:47:22,040
Scenario.

1044
03:47:22,040 --> 03:47:27,479
That's all I need to tell you.

1045
03:47:27,479 --> 03:47:37,659
Really?

1046
03:47:43,959 --> 03:47:45,959
Get this shit off me!

1047
03:47:50,329 --> 03:47:52,329
You just...

1048
03:47:52,329 --> 03:47:55,510
You should just...

1049
03:47:55,510 --> 03:48:05,670
You shouldn't just pet it for a while.

1050
03:48:05,670 --> 03:48:07,670
Whatever you're doing.

1051
03:48:07,670 --> 03:48:09,670
Here we go. You and me, let's go!

1052
03:48:09,670 --> 03:48:11,979
Forward!

1053
03:48:11,979 --> 03:48:15,180
Good call. Let's do it. Emergency.

1054
03:48:15,180 --> 03:48:17,180
You and me.

1055
03:48:17,180 --> 03:48:21,379
Yeah, that means you have to go too.

1056
03:48:21,379 --> 03:48:25,860
Yes, I know.

1057
03:48:25,860 --> 03:48:27,860
You're not going to come with me.

1058
03:48:27,860 --> 03:48:30,299
You're just telling me whatever.

1059
03:48:30,299 --> 03:48:32,469
They were taking hostages.

1060
03:48:32,469 --> 03:48:43,079
They were asking about Harlan Wade.

1061
03:48:43,079 --> 03:48:45,079
What happened to human Garfields?

1062
03:48:45,079 --> 03:48:52,870
Our office is in the...

1063
03:48:52,870 --> 03:48:54,870
Oh, nice.

1064
03:48:54,870 --> 03:49:12,860
Health permanent at 9135.

1065
03:49:12,860 --> 03:49:24,250
Up we go.

1066
03:49:24,250 --> 03:49:26,250
Shit just comes back in my head.

1067
03:49:26,250 --> 03:49:28,250
I can't stop it from coming back.

1068
03:49:28,250 --> 03:49:32,659
I feel like I've been hearing this alarm

1069
03:49:32,659 --> 03:49:36,950
for two straight hours.

1070
03:49:36,950 --> 03:49:46,620
Hey, I'll be seeing your mail back.

1071
03:49:46,620 --> 03:49:48,620
Oh, mega lol.

1072
03:49:48,620 --> 03:49:50,620
Shit.

1073
03:49:50,620 --> 03:50:11,799
Alright, turn it off.

1074
03:50:11,799 --> 03:50:14,170
There's been just a constant

1075
03:50:14,170 --> 03:50:16,170
morning alarm going.

1076
03:50:16,170 --> 03:50:18,170
This whole time I've been here.

1077
03:50:18,170 --> 03:50:21,940
It's like, yes, I know. I need to wake up for work.

1078
03:50:21,940 --> 03:50:26,739
Sure.

1079
03:50:26,739 --> 03:50:28,739
150 pounds. I was like, wait, what?

1080
03:50:28,739 --> 03:50:35,459
That's not a lot.

1081
03:50:35,459 --> 03:50:38,469
Alright, get it off. Thank you.

1082
03:50:38,469 --> 03:50:41,350
Did I need those?

1083
03:50:41,350 --> 03:51:08,469
Is there something behind me here?

1084
03:51:08,469 --> 03:51:10,469
I'm just trying to scare... I'm just trying to see if, you know,

1085
03:51:10,469 --> 03:51:12,469
if it's flinched or something.

1086
03:51:12,469 --> 03:51:18,659
Where's my flashlight?

1087
03:51:18,659 --> 03:51:21,989
I don't have a flashlight anymore.

1088
03:51:21,989 --> 03:51:34,729
Well, that's not good.

1089
03:51:36,729 --> 03:51:38,729
No.

1090
03:51:38,729 --> 03:51:42,819
Well, I thought you said...

1091
03:51:42,819 --> 03:51:51,659
I thought you said this didn't work.

1092
03:51:51,659 --> 03:51:54,340
Uh-oh, this is the part that...

1093
03:51:54,340 --> 03:52:00,170
I did it. I made it.

1094
03:52:00,170 --> 03:52:02,170
For a second I was very confused why I could not go this way.

1095
03:52:02,170 --> 03:52:09,780
Biak.

1096
03:52:09,780 --> 03:52:11,780
Biak.

1097
03:52:11,780 --> 03:52:13,780
Biak.

1098
03:52:13,780 --> 03:52:15,780
Head biak. Biak.

1099
03:52:15,780 --> 03:52:19,500
Oh, I can't go through.

1100
03:52:19,500 --> 03:52:21,500
I actually can't do this. I have to do it another way.

1101
03:52:21,500 --> 03:52:27,379
Shit. Really?

1102
03:52:27,379 --> 03:52:29,819
Can I climb anything?

1103
03:52:29,819 --> 03:52:35,379
Yes, I can.

1104
03:52:35,379 --> 03:52:48,229
Why is this...

1105
03:52:48,229 --> 03:52:50,229
This looks like it should be right, but it doesn't

1106
03:52:50,229 --> 03:52:53,879
look like it is.

1107
03:52:53,879 --> 03:53:08,520
Oh, right there.

1108
03:53:08,520 --> 03:53:14,020
Get out that way.

1109
03:53:14,020 --> 03:53:17,350
Anything else here?

1110
03:53:17,350 --> 03:53:19,350
I can stand up right there.

1111
03:53:19,350 --> 03:53:21,909
But I don't think it does anything.

1112
03:53:21,909 --> 03:53:23,909
This is just the beginning of GoldenEye, the facility level.

1113
03:53:23,909 --> 03:53:26,219
Which is the best level.

1114
03:53:26,219 --> 03:53:28,219
Can I tell you guys something?

1115
03:53:28,219 --> 03:53:30,219
When I used to play GoldenEye,

1116
03:53:30,219 --> 03:53:32,219
I actually do not really know

1117
03:53:32,219 --> 03:53:34,219
what the last

1118
03:53:34,219 --> 03:53:36,219
six or seven GoldenEye levels look like.

1119
03:53:36,219 --> 03:53:38,219
Because when I was younger,

1120
03:53:38,219 --> 03:53:40,219
I would just go to the facility.

1121
03:53:40,219 --> 03:53:42,219
That was one of the first games

1122
03:53:42,219 --> 03:53:44,219
where you could kind of just do anything.

1123
03:53:44,219 --> 03:53:46,219
You could just do whatever you wanted.

1124
03:53:46,219 --> 03:53:48,219
There was a mission, but you could just kind of

1125
03:53:48,219 --> 03:53:50,219
go anywhere you really wanted to.

1126
03:53:50,219 --> 03:53:52,219
So what I would do,

1127
03:53:52,219 --> 03:53:54,219
I'm actually...

1128
03:53:54,219 --> 03:53:56,219
Something's fucking wrong with me.

1129
03:53:56,219 --> 03:53:58,219
I'm realizing this right now.

1130
03:53:58,219 --> 03:54:00,219
So I would just go to the facility level

1131
03:54:00,219 --> 03:54:02,219
and find interesting ways to shoot the guy

1132
03:54:02,219 --> 03:54:04,219
that was in the bathroom stall.

1133
03:54:04,219 --> 03:54:10,170
There was a guy in the bathroom

1134
03:54:10,170 --> 03:54:12,170
and you...

1135
03:54:12,170 --> 03:54:14,170
I wanted to try to just, okay,

1136
03:54:14,170 --> 03:54:16,170
get him and then hide and just watch everybody,

1137
03:54:16,170 --> 03:54:18,170
watch the alarms go off and stuff.

1138
03:54:18,170 --> 03:54:20,170
Throw a grenade down there

1139
03:54:20,170 --> 03:54:22,170
and just wait for the alarm to go off

1140
03:54:22,170 --> 03:54:24,170
and then hang out and be like,

1141
03:54:24,170 --> 03:54:27,500
I'm just in the vent, nobody knows!

1142
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:30,500
If I have...

1143
03:54:30,500 --> 03:54:32,500
Let's say I probably realistically have

1144
03:54:32,500 --> 03:54:34,500
200 to 300 hours in GoldenEye.

1145
03:54:34,500 --> 03:54:36,500
At least 100 of them were

1146
03:54:36,500 --> 03:54:38,500
in the vent in the facility.

1147
03:54:38,500 --> 03:54:48,409
It has to be.

1148
03:54:48,409 --> 03:54:50,840
Seriously.

1149
03:54:50,840 --> 03:54:56,200
Where is it?

1150
03:54:56,200 --> 03:55:06,489
Is that Garfield?

1151
03:55:06,489 --> 03:55:09,819
Oh, okay.

1152
03:55:09,819 --> 03:55:11,819
Looks like somebody already did

1153
03:55:11,819 --> 03:55:18,729
the thing that I was about to do.

1154
03:55:18,729 --> 03:55:20,729
I'm not going to make that same reference.

1155
03:55:20,729 --> 03:55:22,969
They all did it already.

1156
03:55:22,969 --> 03:55:26,420
The data's uploading.

1157
03:55:26,420 --> 03:55:28,420
Well, this confirms the point of Perseus

1158
03:55:28,420 --> 03:55:30,420
was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers.

1159
03:55:30,420 --> 03:55:35,350
Why would that kill you?

1160
03:55:35,350 --> 03:55:40,729
Wouldn't you be cushioned by

1161
03:55:40,729 --> 03:55:42,729
all the, like, people?

1162
03:55:42,729 --> 03:55:44,729
This is not that far of a fall.

1163
03:55:44,729 --> 03:55:57,379
And it's just dead.

1164
03:55:57,379 --> 03:56:01,860
Okay. You had some other issues,

1165
03:56:01,860 --> 03:56:03,860
I think, besides just falling down.

1166
03:56:03,860 --> 03:56:06,549
The data's uploading.

1167
03:56:06,549 --> 03:56:09,110
Slide, kick him in.

1168
03:56:09,110 --> 03:56:11,110
Well, this confirms the point of Perseus

1169
03:56:11,110 --> 03:56:13,110
was to train telepathic commanders to work with cloned soldiers.

1170
03:56:13,110 --> 03:56:15,110
Although it looks like Jackson and Fettel

1171
03:56:15,110 --> 03:56:17,110
were the only commanders in the program.

1172
03:56:17,110 --> 03:56:19,110
The weird thing is, they were further invented

1173
03:56:19,110 --> 03:56:21,110
after the drone attack.

1174
03:56:21,110 --> 03:56:23,420
I can't think that's funny.

1175
03:56:23,420 --> 03:56:25,420
I slide in.

1176
03:56:25,420 --> 03:56:31,799
Nope. Okay, we're good.

1177
03:56:31,799 --> 03:56:33,799
All right, thanks for whatever I just did.

1178
03:56:33,799 --> 03:56:44,549
Okay, let's go.

1179
03:56:44,549 --> 03:56:46,549
Open fucking world. You wouldn't do it.

1180
03:56:46,549 --> 03:56:48,549
You wouldn't, like, break this.

1181
03:56:48,549 --> 03:56:50,549
It's a two window there.

1182
03:56:50,549 --> 03:57:31,299
Open fucking world.

1183
03:57:31,299 --> 03:57:33,799
Got it!

1184
03:57:33,799 --> 03:58:02,780
I saw you!

1185
03:58:02,780 --> 03:58:50,629
Here we go!

1186
03:58:50,629 --> 03:58:52,629
Kind of messy, but, you know, I'll take it.

1187
03:58:52,629 --> 03:59:14,899
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!

1188
03:59:14,899 --> 03:59:20,469
Sorry, that was fucking sloppy, anyways.

1189
03:59:20,469 --> 04:00:06,540
Go, one, two, three.

1190
04:00:06,540 --> 04:00:08,540
All right, we're good. One, two, three.

1191
04:00:08,540 --> 04:00:27,420
This is a silent fucking gameplay.

1192
04:00:27,420 --> 04:00:31,379
You're gonna try

1193
04:00:31,379 --> 04:00:33,379
to move the thing that's see-through

1194
04:00:33,379 --> 04:00:46,889
in the way so I don't shoot you.

1195
04:00:46,889 --> 04:00:51,110
Bring it on. I see light, I see

1196
04:00:51,110 --> 04:00:53,110
light, I see light.

1197
04:00:53,110 --> 04:01:03,540
Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on. This is the one, this is the one.

1198
04:01:03,540 --> 04:01:07,319
This is right in front of me.

1199
04:01:07,319 --> 04:01:09,319
It's right in front of me. Why did I do that?

1200
04:01:09,319 --> 04:01:40,280
Pick it back up.

1201
04:01:40,280 --> 04:01:42,280
He was waiting for me.

1202
04:01:42,280 --> 04:01:44,579
He wanted to shoot the barrel.

1203
04:01:44,579 --> 04:01:46,579
That's great, I love it.

1204
04:01:46,579 --> 04:01:48,579
He was like, I'm gonna shoot that barrel, I'm gonna shoot that barrel.

1205
04:01:48,579 --> 04:01:50,579
What?

1206
04:01:50,579 --> 04:01:58,969
There's no way you-

1207
04:01:58,969 --> 04:02:22,700
Why were they over there?

1208
04:02:22,700 --> 04:02:27,370
Not this time.

1209
04:02:27,370 --> 04:02:44,579
You idiot. Why are we giving up?

1210
04:02:46,579 --> 04:02:51,450
I'm not giving up on anybody,

1211
04:02:51,450 --> 04:02:58,739
what are we talking about?

1212
04:02:58,739 --> 04:03:01,739
Where?

1213
04:03:03,739 --> 04:03:10,709
It's when I activate it.

1214
04:03:10,709 --> 04:03:12,709
How do they know-

1215
04:03:12,709 --> 04:03:14,709
If I stand still and I activate the slow mo,

1216
04:03:14,709 --> 04:03:17,079
they don't- how do they know?

1217
04:03:17,079 --> 04:03:19,079
They just go, oh no.

1218
04:03:19,079 --> 04:03:21,079
Do I start shaking?

1219
04:03:21,079 --> 04:03:42,379
I thought he was alive.

1220
04:03:42,379 --> 04:03:44,549
Hold on, I'll see-

1221
04:03:44,549 --> 04:03:46,549
Wait.

1222
04:03:46,549 --> 04:03:52,809
My-

1223
04:03:52,809 --> 04:04:01,829
He was trying to kick me.

1224
04:04:01,829 --> 04:04:11,500
This stream is not live. What are you talking about?

1225
04:04:17,370 --> 04:04:19,370
No, we had the same idea!

1226
04:04:25,129 --> 04:04:27,129
What the fuck is that?

1227
04:04:57,739 --> 04:04:59,739
What are you talking about?

1228
04:04:59,739 --> 04:05:01,739
What do you guys mean?

1229
04:05:01,739 --> 04:05:06,790
Look at the funny image, hold on.

1230
04:05:06,790 --> 04:05:13,829
What is it?

1231
04:05:13,829 --> 04:05:16,329
I'm looking, I'm looking.

1232
04:05:17,329 --> 04:05:20,079
It's a very flattering smile.

1233
04:05:20,079 --> 04:05:22,079
Oh my god.

1234
04:05:22,079 --> 04:05:33,709
Is that real though?

1235
04:05:33,709 --> 04:05:35,709
That's real?

1236
04:05:35,709 --> 04:05:50,559
Why do I look like that?

1237
04:05:50,559 --> 04:06:01,309
I don't really look like that though.

1238
04:06:01,309 --> 04:06:03,870
You're getting old.

1239
04:06:03,870 --> 04:06:15,440
Yeah, I know.

1240
04:06:15,440 --> 04:06:31,170
Is he still alive? Where is he?

1241
04:06:31,170 --> 04:06:35,700
Okay, we're good.

1242
04:06:35,700 --> 04:06:40,610
Save it. Bring this up.

1243
04:06:40,610 --> 04:06:42,610
Smile and optimism.

1244
04:06:47,299 --> 04:06:58,059
Three.

1245
04:07:06,840 --> 04:07:08,840
I'm gonna go up ten.

1246
04:07:08,840 --> 04:07:10,840
Full health, super save.

1247
04:07:10,840 --> 04:07:16,219
Oh, okay.

1248
04:07:16,219 --> 04:07:22,040
Shit.

1249
04:07:45,399 --> 04:07:47,399
Nice Waluigi impression.

1250
04:07:47,399 --> 04:07:50,280
Little too much grit though.

1251
04:07:50,280 --> 04:07:55,399
You gotta bring it down a little bit more.

1252
04:07:55,399 --> 04:08:05,319
That was a bad quick save spot.

1253
04:08:05,319 --> 04:08:23,290
It's okay.

1254
04:08:23,290 --> 04:08:25,290
Where is it?

1255
04:08:25,290 --> 04:08:36,149
Alright, I'm going in.

1256
04:08:36,149 --> 04:08:42,170
Fuck it, here we go.

1257
04:08:42,170 --> 04:08:50,420
One, two, three, go!

1258
04:08:50,420 --> 04:08:52,420
Oh, I bounced him.

1259
04:08:52,420 --> 04:08:58,309
Okay, so far so good.

1260
04:08:58,309 --> 04:09:11,110
Flash warning!

1261
04:09:11,110 --> 04:09:19,350
Screams.

1262
04:09:19,350 --> 04:09:32,920
Fuck, wrong way.

1263
04:09:32,920 --> 04:09:49,350
Never mind.

1264
04:09:49,350 --> 04:09:51,350
I'm gonna try something.

1265
04:09:51,350 --> 04:09:55,500
You pick it up with F.

1266
04:09:55,500 --> 04:10:15,530
That was like so...

1267
04:10:15,530 --> 04:10:17,530
It had to have been fake, right?

1268
04:10:17,530 --> 04:10:21,049
Had to have been.

1269
04:10:21,049 --> 04:10:23,049
And I agree with you.

1270
04:10:23,049 --> 04:10:34,500
It had to have been.

1271
04:10:34,500 --> 04:10:38,899
Is it saved? Yeah.

1272
04:10:38,899 --> 04:10:43,639
Get off there!

1273
04:10:43,639 --> 04:10:46,200
Who's...

1274
04:10:46,200 --> 04:10:49,850
He's throwing a grenade?

1275
04:10:49,850 --> 04:10:55,670
What the...

1276
04:10:55,670 --> 04:10:57,979
Why would you throw?

1277
04:10:57,979 --> 04:11:00,600
Whoa!

1278
04:11:00,600 --> 04:11:02,600
I think I shot his gun and it fired and hit me in the face.

1279
04:11:02,600 --> 04:11:12,260
Un-fucking-believable.

1280
04:11:12,260 --> 04:11:18,790
Wrong button.

1281
04:11:18,790 --> 04:11:20,790
Playing with fire, playing with fire!

1282
04:11:20,790 --> 04:11:31,610
I'm trying to do fucking cool moves.

1283
04:11:31,610 --> 04:11:33,610
Alright, I'm done.

1284
04:11:33,610 --> 04:11:56,569
Fuck, that hurt.

1285
04:11:56,569 --> 04:12:16,579
We good?

1286
04:12:16,579 --> 04:12:24,500
I think so.

1287
04:12:24,500 --> 04:12:29,370
Good.

1288
04:12:29,370 --> 04:12:31,370
Somebody asked how long I've been streaming tonight.

1289
04:12:31,370 --> 04:12:37,370
So, for the next week or so, I'm gonna do a thing where I only stream for four amounts of time.

1290
04:12:37,370 --> 04:12:39,370
Beep.

1291
04:12:39,370 --> 04:12:41,739
Is that guy on the other side of the building?

1292
04:12:41,739 --> 04:12:46,340
Did I drop a grenade in the ground?

1293
04:12:46,340 --> 04:13:00,489
What an idiot.

1294
04:13:00,489 --> 04:13:13,100
It's never not gonna be funny.

1295
04:13:17,879 --> 04:13:20,440
Okay, he's gone.

1296
04:13:20,440 --> 04:13:23,829
But anyways,

1297
04:13:23,829 --> 04:13:26,139
I'm trying to spread out the streams this week.

1298
04:13:26,139 --> 04:13:32,139
To do more streams, but less time on the streams.

1299
04:13:32,139 --> 04:13:34,139
If that makes any sense.

1300
04:13:34,139 --> 04:13:44,360
It should.

1301
04:13:44,360 --> 04:13:46,360
Like five hours?

1302
04:13:46,360 --> 04:13:48,360
Yes, it really depends.

1303
04:13:48,360 --> 04:13:54,360
Because, for anyone that wasn't here an hour or two ago, or the couple when I started talking about it in the first place,

1304
04:13:54,360 --> 04:13:58,360
I'm on a couple of new medications for my stomach that...

1305
04:13:58,360 --> 04:14:04,700
Hold on, this is important.

1306
04:14:04,700 --> 04:14:06,700
Oh, what the fuck?

1307
04:14:31,500 --> 04:14:33,500
I mean, I could be...

1308
04:14:33,500 --> 04:14:35,500
Whatever, I could just tell you.

1309
04:14:35,500 --> 04:14:37,860
It's not like I'm embarrassed by it.

1310
04:14:37,860 --> 04:14:41,639
Who cares?

1311
04:14:41,639 --> 04:14:44,579
Oh, hold on.

1312
04:14:44,579 --> 04:14:46,579
He hasn't told us.

1313
04:14:46,579 --> 04:14:49,909
No, I haven't.

1314
04:14:49,909 --> 04:14:53,750
I have not. You're right, I haven't.

1315
04:14:53,750 --> 04:14:56,950
What is it?

1316
04:14:56,950 --> 04:14:58,950
Well, I'll let you deduce that for yourselves.

1317
04:14:58,950 --> 04:15:01,579
What would I be on that would...

1318
04:15:01,579 --> 04:15:04,709
Oh, hold on.

1319
04:15:04,709 --> 04:15:06,709
I don't know, I want...

1320
04:15:06,709 --> 04:15:08,709
Ah, the sniper rifle's fun though.

1321
04:15:08,709 --> 04:15:12,709
I'm on a certain medication that requires me to do something.

1322
04:15:12,709 --> 04:15:16,709
A few times a day.

1323
04:15:16,709 --> 04:15:20,709
And it's a strong medication that has a specific purpose.

1324
04:15:20,709 --> 04:15:30,600
And it's just causing me some stomach upset, discomfort, and...

1325
04:15:30,600 --> 04:15:36,030
I can't really be in the same place for more than four or five hours, really.

1326
04:15:36,030 --> 04:15:38,340
No, I'm not doing cocaine.

1327
04:15:38,340 --> 04:15:46,909
But I'm on two new medications.

1328
04:15:46,909 --> 04:15:48,909
That's one of them.

1329
04:15:48,909 --> 04:15:53,409
And the other one is kind of working together with it.

1330
04:15:53,409 --> 04:15:57,709
So, there will be more streams, but not as long.

1331
04:15:57,709 --> 04:16:01,659
This week.

1332
04:16:01,659 --> 04:16:03,969
Cocaine is one of them.

1333
04:16:03,969 --> 04:16:05,969
So you can't clip it.

1334
04:16:05,969 --> 04:16:09,420
Whatever, who cares?

1335
04:16:09,420 --> 04:16:12,110
Where am I supposed to go? Rejoin?

1336
04:16:12,110 --> 04:16:18,510
The Holiday Bishop on the roof.

1337
04:16:18,510 --> 04:16:22,739
Isn't that where we are?

1338
04:16:22,739 --> 04:16:30,100
I'm on the roof, let's go!

1339
04:16:30,100 --> 04:16:39,569
The other roof.

1340
04:16:39,569 --> 04:16:41,569
There is no other roof, there's only one roof.

1341
04:16:41,569 --> 04:16:44,899
I mean, I guess I have to go through here?

1342
04:16:44,899 --> 04:16:47,760
Did I just miss a door?

1343
04:16:47,760 --> 04:17:00,750
Yeah, it looks like I did.

1344
04:17:00,750 --> 04:17:04,979
I just wrapped around.

1345
04:17:04,979 --> 04:17:08,500
Nope.

1346
04:17:08,500 --> 04:17:11,569
Fuck.

1347
04:17:11,569 --> 04:17:13,569
Okay, I killed it.

1348
04:17:13,569 --> 04:17:15,569
I killed it, I'm sorry.

1349
04:17:15,569 --> 04:17:17,569
He died instantly.

1350
04:17:17,569 --> 04:17:19,569
I really am so sorry.

1351
04:17:19,569 --> 04:17:22,190
He's just trying to tell the news.

1352
04:17:22,190 --> 04:17:33,569
We're good.

1353
04:17:33,569 --> 04:17:35,569
I'm going to pick up, I'm taking the sniper rifle.

1354
04:17:35,569 --> 04:17:38,059
I feel like why would they keep showing it to me?

1355
04:17:38,059 --> 04:17:43,309
You're leaving without me.

1356
04:17:43,309 --> 04:17:45,309
You're leaving without me!

1357
04:17:45,309 --> 04:17:47,309
Say it!

1358
04:17:47,309 --> 04:17:55,120
Oh, he's gone.

1359
04:17:55,120 --> 04:17:58,829
That was quick, alright.

1360
04:17:58,829 --> 04:18:19,229
What's going on with this guy's body?

1361
04:18:19,229 --> 04:18:21,229
I mean, he was being a little strange.

1362
04:18:21,229 --> 04:18:25,010
He was being a little strange.

1363
04:18:31,940 --> 04:18:34,940
I thought it was him!

1364
04:18:34,940 --> 04:18:36,940
I thought it was the guy flying off the...

1365
04:18:36,940 --> 04:19:03,680
I thought it was the guy flying off the...

1366
04:19:03,680 --> 04:19:05,680
I thought it was the guy flying off the...

1367
04:19:05,680 --> 04:19:08,299
I thought it was the guy flying off the...

1368
04:19:08,299 --> 04:19:10,299
They had the same kind of

1369
04:19:10,299 --> 04:19:12,299
cadence and tone.

1370
04:19:12,299 --> 04:19:17,360
Ugh.

1371
04:19:17,360 --> 04:19:19,360
Okay, again.

1372
04:19:19,360 --> 04:19:21,360
That's a lot of money though.

1373
04:19:21,360 --> 04:19:24,559
Hold on.

1374
04:19:24,559 --> 04:19:32,989
Goodbye.

1375
04:19:32,989 --> 04:19:34,989
Somebody give a hundred dollars.

1376
04:19:34,989 --> 04:19:36,989
Ten thousand bits, hold on.

1377
04:19:36,989 --> 04:19:38,989
He didn't feel very friendly to me.

1378
04:19:38,989 --> 04:19:40,989
I think that they were deliberately targeting me.

1379
04:19:40,989 --> 04:19:44,059
What the fuck are you doing?

1380
04:19:44,059 --> 04:19:55,459
He's like

1381
04:19:55,459 --> 04:19:57,459
flying in a circle.

1382
04:19:57,459 --> 04:19:59,459
Ugh.

1383
04:19:59,459 --> 04:20:01,459
One of his colleagues.

1384
04:20:01,459 --> 04:20:04,020
What the fuck are we doing?

1385
04:20:04,020 --> 04:20:06,020
Who is this? This is the shoulder guy.

1386
04:20:06,020 --> 04:20:12,209
Ugh.

1387
04:20:12,209 --> 04:20:14,209
This game is really, really fun.

1388
04:20:14,209 --> 04:20:18,479
This has been

1389
04:20:18,479 --> 04:20:28,850
just very fun.

1390
04:20:28,850 --> 04:20:32,049
He's over here!

1391
04:20:32,049 --> 04:20:34,739
What the fuck?

1392
04:20:34,739 --> 04:20:36,739
How did you get me that quickly?

1393
04:20:36,739 --> 04:20:38,739
PumpkinSmasher68

1394
04:20:38,739 --> 04:20:40,739
gave ten thousand bits.

1395
04:20:40,739 --> 04:20:42,739
That's one hundred bucks in bits. That's a shitload of money.

1396
04:20:42,739 --> 04:20:44,739
Thank you, Pumpkin.

1397
04:20:44,739 --> 04:20:46,739
I hope this makes your day better.

1398
04:20:49,360 --> 04:20:51,360
It's a hundred dollars.

1399
04:20:51,360 --> 04:20:53,360
That's a shitload of money.

1400
04:20:53,360 --> 04:20:55,360
I mean, thank you.

1401
04:20:55,360 --> 04:20:59,459
Why are they not shooting me?

1402
04:20:59,459 --> 04:21:09,500
He's over here!

1403
04:21:09,500 --> 04:21:11,870
What the fuck is ATC doing?

1404
04:21:11,870 --> 04:21:13,870
Thanks a lot, PumpkinSmasher.

1405
04:21:13,870 --> 04:21:15,870
Seriously.

1406
04:21:15,870 --> 04:21:17,870
You made my day really good.

1407
04:21:17,870 --> 04:21:19,870
Thank you.

1408
04:21:19,870 --> 04:21:21,870
I'm gonna buy a fucking large

1409
04:21:21,870 --> 04:21:23,870
pizza with that. Why would this guy die?

1410
04:21:23,870 --> 04:21:28,219
Feels pumpkin, man.

1411
04:21:28,219 --> 04:21:31,020
Thank you.

1412
04:21:31,020 --> 04:21:33,389
It's quiet. This is my opportunity.

1413
04:21:33,389 --> 04:21:35,389
This is my chance. Okay, they come

1414
04:21:35,389 --> 04:21:40,190
through this door.

1415
04:21:40,190 --> 04:21:43,459
That's as far as you can throw that.

1416
04:21:43,459 --> 04:21:45,459
That's unbelievably pathetic.

1417
04:21:45,459 --> 04:21:54,780
That's ridiculous. I could

1418
04:21:54,780 --> 04:22:04,959
throw that shit over that roof.

1419
04:22:08,959 --> 04:22:23,299
Where's the other one?

1420
04:22:23,299 --> 04:22:25,600
Where's the other one?

1421
04:22:25,600 --> 04:22:28,540
Wasn't there two?

1422
04:22:28,540 --> 04:22:30,540
Wasn't there a second person?

1423
04:22:30,540 --> 04:23:01,010
I can't!

1424
04:23:01,010 --> 04:23:03,010
Okay, I need to pay attention.

1425
04:23:03,010 --> 04:23:05,010
It's too fun to just...

1426
04:23:05,010 --> 04:23:09,790
Okay.

1427
04:23:34,020 --> 04:23:36,260
No!

1428
04:23:36,260 --> 04:23:56,739
Just do it!

1429
04:23:56,739 --> 04:24:05,629
You don't have to get close!

1430
04:24:05,629 --> 04:24:07,629
I'm getting too close!

1431
04:24:07,629 --> 04:24:09,629
I don't know why I'm doing that!

1432
04:24:09,629 --> 04:24:11,629
Why am I getting so close to everybody?

1433
04:24:11,629 --> 04:24:13,629
I was doing fine!

1434
04:24:13,629 --> 04:24:15,629
I wanted to get over there

1435
04:24:15,629 --> 04:24:17,629
and I don't know what I was thinking.

1436
04:24:17,629 --> 04:24:33,100
Okay, I'm done.

1437
04:24:33,100 --> 04:24:35,100
I'm ready.

1438
04:24:58,360 --> 04:26:00,489
Out of here!

1439
04:26:00,489 --> 04:26:02,920
I wanted to watch him go!

1440
04:26:02,920 --> 04:26:10,340
Okay, that wasn't on fucking purpose.

1441
04:26:10,340 --> 04:26:12,340
Fuck. Everyone's going to think that I did that on

1442
04:26:12,340 --> 04:26:14,340
fucking purpose and I did, but I didn't.

1443
04:26:14,340 --> 04:26:16,579
I did, but I didn't.

1444
04:26:16,579 --> 04:26:18,579
You understand? I did, but I didn't.

1445
04:26:18,579 --> 04:26:20,579
I wanted to do a final look to...

1446
04:26:20,579 --> 04:26:22,579
I did, but I didn't. And that was not...

1447
04:26:22,579 --> 04:26:30,780
It was, but it wasn't. You understand?

1448
04:26:30,780 --> 04:26:32,780
I swear I've not tried to do this

1449
04:26:32,780 --> 04:26:34,780
this many times.

1450
04:26:53,280 --> 04:26:58,399
Who the fuck are you?

1451
04:26:58,399 --> 04:27:07,600
He's here!

1452
04:27:07,600 --> 04:27:11,489
How close are you?

1453
04:27:11,489 --> 04:27:13,489
He's trying to flank!

1454
04:27:13,489 --> 04:27:15,489
What? No, I'm not! I'm trying to...

1455
04:27:15,489 --> 04:27:23,170
Where is this person? Oh, right there.

1456
04:27:23,170 --> 04:27:32,500
Are they dead? Oh, fuck.

1457
04:27:32,500 --> 04:27:39,280
I thought that was a face.

1458
04:27:39,280 --> 04:28:01,790
You're not alive!

1459
04:28:01,790 --> 04:28:03,790
Has been neutralized. Flashlight!

1460
04:28:03,790 --> 04:28:07,819
Good work! He's over here!

1461
04:28:11,409 --> 04:28:16,590
These guys...

1462
04:28:16,590 --> 04:28:18,590
It's so dangerous. This shit is

1463
04:28:18,590 --> 04:28:21,149
so powerful. I have no more healing.

1464
04:28:33,100 --> 04:28:52,620
Good. That's what I want.

1465
04:28:52,620 --> 04:28:55,950
He's over here!

1466
04:28:57,950 --> 04:29:03,709
Close the fucking door!

1467
04:29:03,709 --> 04:29:25,090
Alright, give me that. Give me that shit.

1468
04:29:25,090 --> 04:29:33,260
Go down. Why can I not go over here?

1469
04:29:33,260 --> 04:29:42,139
How the hell do I get out?

1470
04:29:42,139 --> 04:29:50,700
Uh oh. I'm good. Okay, let's go.

1471
04:29:50,700 --> 04:29:52,700
There's no Half-Life crouch jump?

1472
04:29:52,700 --> 04:29:54,700
I know what the fuck is going on there.

1473
04:29:54,700 --> 04:29:57,649
One health pack.

1474
04:29:57,649 --> 04:30:00,020
This is around the corner here. Alright.

1475
04:30:00,020 --> 04:30:21,899
I can go the other way.

1476
04:30:21,899 --> 04:30:24,139
Good health. Nice.

1477
04:30:24,139 --> 04:30:26,139
They do put it everywhere though, so that's good.

1478
04:30:26,139 --> 04:30:36,500
We're up here.

1479
04:30:36,500 --> 04:30:38,500
Snipers. That's why, because they had sniper rifles.

1480
04:30:38,500 --> 04:30:41,440
Damn. Okay.

1481
04:30:41,440 --> 04:30:44,639
I got ammo for it.

1482
04:30:44,639 --> 04:30:46,639
Might as well use it.

1483
04:30:46,639 --> 04:30:57,840
Watch out! Grenade!

1484
04:30:57,840 --> 04:31:05,250
How would you see that?

1485
04:31:05,250 --> 04:31:08,899
I don't think they got out. How would you know

1486
04:31:08,899 --> 04:31:11,200
that was a grenade? You just, you wouldn't.

1487
04:31:11,200 --> 04:31:24,129
Oh, music. What does that mean?

1488
04:31:24,129 --> 04:31:31,100
Alright, refilling all the health. That's good.

1489
04:31:31,100 --> 04:31:33,100
Flashlight. What?

1490
04:31:33,100 --> 04:31:40,319
Get down!

1491
04:31:40,319 --> 04:31:42,319
The fuck just happened?

1492
04:31:42,319 --> 04:31:44,319
It went like anti-gravity.

1493
04:31:44,319 --> 04:31:47,069
What? What happened?

1494
04:31:47,069 --> 04:32:06,190
What the fuck?

1495
04:32:06,190 --> 04:32:08,190
Okay, I'm fine.

1496
04:32:08,190 --> 04:32:10,190
Oh, what the, what the fuck?

1497
04:32:10,190 --> 04:32:23,309
What the fuck?

1498
04:32:23,309 --> 04:32:25,309
Find a way back up to the main building. Oh, you bastard.

1499
04:32:25,309 --> 04:32:27,549
Really?

1500
04:32:27,549 --> 04:32:49,700
You gonna do this shit to me right now?

1501
04:32:49,700 --> 04:32:58,129
Uh, okay.

1502
04:32:58,129 --> 04:33:00,129
I guess I'm going over, oh.

1503
04:33:00,129 --> 04:33:02,620
Ooh. Alright.

1504
04:33:02,620 --> 04:33:06,209
I'll take it. Thank you.

1505
04:33:06,209 --> 04:33:09,599
Now we gotta go, uh,

1506
04:33:09,599 --> 04:33:14,080
up there,

1507
04:33:14,080 --> 04:33:16,959
somehow.

1508
04:33:16,959 --> 04:33:18,959
Or under. Wait, there we go.

1509
04:33:18,959 --> 04:33:22,849
Alright, what's, what's going on here?

1510
04:33:22,849 --> 04:33:24,849
There's like a giant animal in there.

1511
04:33:24,849 --> 04:33:27,659
Shotgun time. Mine's screwing around here.

1512
04:33:27,659 --> 04:33:30,349
What is that?

1513
04:33:30,349 --> 04:33:33,869
I thought that was a,

1514
04:33:33,869 --> 04:33:43,139
it's alright.

1515
04:33:43,139 --> 04:33:45,139
Uh, I need to get that health back.

1516
04:33:45,139 --> 04:33:47,889
Can I reach the wall?

1517
04:33:47,889 --> 04:34:04,720
Let me, let me exploit this.

1518
04:34:04,720 --> 04:34:08,180
I can't get up there.

1519
04:34:08,180 --> 04:34:10,180
What is going on right now? Why is the,

1520
04:34:10,180 --> 04:34:26,110
why is the world shaking?

1521
04:34:26,110 --> 04:34:30,270
I knew it was gonna fall.

1522
04:34:30,270 --> 04:34:34,240
I knew it.

1523
04:34:34,240 --> 04:34:36,240
And there ain't any other way to go, so I have to go around.

1524
04:34:36,240 --> 04:34:38,479
Can't make that jump.

1525
04:34:38,479 --> 04:34:47,439
So that leaves,

1526
04:34:47,439 --> 04:34:55,950
uh, over here.

1527
04:34:55,950 --> 04:35:01,009
I guess we're gonna try over here.

1528
04:35:01,009 --> 04:35:03,180
No, this is where I came in, so.

1529
04:35:03,180 --> 04:35:05,490
If I go this way,

1530
04:35:05,490 --> 04:35:07,490
that way is, okay,

1531
04:35:07,490 --> 04:35:09,490
over here. No, I, can I get up

1532
04:35:09,490 --> 04:35:40,060
that? Huh.

1533
04:35:40,060 --> 04:35:43,520
Can I do anything with that?

1534
04:35:43,520 --> 04:35:45,759
Just go forward?

1535
04:35:45,759 --> 04:35:48,639
I, I guess,

1536
04:35:48,639 --> 04:36:04,450
but I can't really go over here.

1537
04:36:04,450 --> 04:36:09,549
Wait, can I go?

1538
04:36:09,549 --> 04:36:12,430
Alright, I guess I'm going this way.

1539
04:36:12,430 --> 04:36:39,810
Oh shit, okay.

1540
04:36:39,810 --> 04:36:46,340
No, I can't go that way either.

1541
04:36:46,340 --> 04:36:55,020
Let's try over here.

1542
04:36:55,020 --> 04:37:06,099
He hates gaming. That may have just ended the stream.

1543
04:37:06,099 --> 04:37:22,990
I'm not gonna,

1544
04:37:22,990 --> 04:37:26,959
no, he didn't poop.

1545
04:37:26,959 --> 04:37:30,669
I'm starting to get, um,

1546
04:37:30,669 --> 04:37:33,619
a little queasy.

1547
04:37:33,619 --> 04:37:35,619
There's nothing to do with the game. It has to do with what's going on in my life right now.

1548
04:37:35,619 --> 04:37:37,619
So, um,

1549
04:37:37,619 --> 04:37:39,619
yeah,

1550
04:37:39,619 --> 04:37:43,520
on the next stopping point, I think I'll call it.

1551
04:37:43,520 --> 04:37:49,090
They left her in darkness.

1552
04:37:49,090 --> 04:37:51,090
That'll be just exactly where I wanted to stop anyways.

1553
04:37:51,090 --> 04:37:53,090
In about, like, five hours.

1554
04:37:53,090 --> 04:38:07,419
Yeah, I just got a good

1555
04:38:07,419 --> 04:38:09,419
checkpoint.

1556
04:38:09,419 --> 04:38:13,139
I don't wanna push it. Yeah, that's good.

1557
04:38:13,139 --> 04:38:16,000
That'll be good. We'll keep going tomorrow.

1558
04:38:16,000 --> 04:38:18,000
So again, for the next, like, four or five days,

1559
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:20,000
we're gonna do

1560
04:38:20,000 --> 04:38:22,000
more days, but shorter streams.

1561
04:38:22,000 --> 04:38:24,689
Uh, plus I actually

1562
04:38:24,689 --> 04:38:27,060
have to go take

1563
04:38:27,060 --> 04:38:29,060
some of this medicine now.

1564
04:38:29,060 --> 04:38:32,000
And it's not gonna be fun.

1565
04:38:32,000 --> 04:38:34,000
But, I will see you guys tomorrow.

1566
04:38:34,000 --> 04:38:36,369
We'll call it there.

1567
04:38:36,369 --> 04:38:39,680
Oh, okay.

1568
04:38:39,680 --> 04:38:43,200
This is a lot of fun.

1569
04:38:43,200 --> 04:38:45,700
This was a blast. This game's great.

1570
04:38:45,700 --> 04:38:47,700
Anybody know how much is left?

1571
04:38:47,700 --> 04:38:50,130
What time tomorrow?

1572
04:38:50,130 --> 04:38:52,130
It's regular time, around one or two.

1573
04:38:52,130 --> 04:38:56,799
It's been about four and a half hours.

1574
04:38:56,799 --> 04:38:58,799
Four hours and forty minutes. Keep a couple hours.

1575
04:38:58,799 --> 04:39:02,189
Okay. This is about

1576
04:39:02,189 --> 04:39:05,580
three hours, four hours.

1577
04:39:05,580 --> 04:39:07,580
Forty-six hours. Alright, then that might be

1578
04:39:07,580 --> 04:39:11,099
a perfect time tomorrow. There's a lot

1579
04:39:11,099 --> 04:39:14,049
to play. We're just gonna spread it out.

1580
04:39:14,049 --> 04:39:16,049
So, thanks for coming. I'll see you guys

1581
04:39:16,049 --> 04:39:18,349
tomorrow. Let's get to the bits

1582
04:39:18,349 --> 04:39:20,349
and everything. We're gonna call it right there.

1583
04:39:20,349 --> 04:39:22,349
I'll just manually save it just in case.

1584
04:39:22,349 --> 04:39:27,599
And we'll see you tomorrow.

1585
04:39:27,599 --> 04:39:29,599
Oh, look. Top subgifter.

1586
04:39:29,599 --> 04:39:31,599
I wonder if they fixed this, cause Streamlabs

1587
04:39:31,599 --> 04:39:35,439
had an update. Let's check and see if they did.

1588
04:39:35,439 --> 04:39:46,819
Uh, let's

1589
04:39:46,819 --> 04:39:51,549
save game.

1590
04:39:53,549 --> 04:39:58,290
Oh, let me see.

1591
04:39:58,290 --> 04:40:00,290
Top subgifter, come on.

1592
04:40:00,290 --> 04:40:03,490
Session.

1593
04:40:03,490 --> 04:40:05,490
They just had an update.

1594
04:40:05,490 --> 04:40:07,490
Tell me they fixed it.

1595
04:40:07,490 --> 04:40:11,069
No!

1596
04:40:11,069 --> 04:40:17,139
Come on. It's not

1597
04:40:17,139 --> 04:40:19,139
me. This is the session.

1598
04:40:19,139 --> 04:40:21,139
I didn't do anything this session.

1599
04:40:21,139 --> 04:40:28,500
Session.

1600
04:40:28,500 --> 04:40:30,500
Let's put on a follower train.

1601
04:40:30,500 --> 04:40:39,889
But, see you tomorrow.

1602
04:40:39,889 --> 04:40:42,639
Oh, fuck.

1603
04:40:42,639 --> 04:40:45,759
I'm getting a little drained.

1604
04:40:45,759 --> 04:40:47,759
But I knew that was gonna happen. That's alright.

1605
04:40:47,759 --> 04:40:49,939
Anyhow,

1606
04:40:49,939 --> 04:40:51,939
let's go back.

1607
04:40:51,939 --> 04:40:59,979
About four hours ago.

1608
04:40:59,979 --> 04:41:02,610
It's rigged. Well, it's rigged to

1609
04:41:02,610 --> 04:41:06,450
reset.

1610
04:41:06,450 --> 04:41:08,450
But thank you Sturdy Bread for the 250. Hey, here's

1611
04:41:08,450 --> 04:41:10,450
some bits. I don't know what to put in these messages.

1612
04:41:10,450 --> 04:41:13,139
Thanks for being the best streamer around.

1613
04:41:13,139 --> 04:41:19,389
Thanks a lot. Glad you had fun.

1614
04:41:19,389 --> 04:41:21,389
Also, thank you Yes Is Online

1615
04:41:21,389 --> 04:41:24,590
for the 250.

1616
04:41:24,590 --> 04:41:26,590
They say, I wish I could fully watch the stream

1617
04:41:26,590 --> 04:41:28,590
today, but my glasses got absolutely destroyed

1618
04:41:28,590 --> 04:41:30,590
at the JPEG

1619
04:41:30,590 --> 04:41:32,590
Mafia show last night and I have to spend my

1620
04:41:32,590 --> 04:41:37,200
entire day blind.

1621
04:41:37,200 --> 04:41:39,200
Inside this Lenscrafters.

1622
04:41:39,200 --> 04:41:42,779
They say, good luck.

1623
04:41:42,779 --> 04:41:51,340
Thank you.

1624
04:41:51,340 --> 04:41:53,340
Thank you Jules for the 250.

1625
04:41:53,340 --> 04:41:55,340
Hey, Jerma, have you experienced anything paranormal

1626
04:41:55,340 --> 04:41:57,340
in your life? If not, will you be

1627
04:41:57,340 --> 04:41:59,340
visiting any haunted places in Vegas

1628
04:41:59,340 --> 04:42:01,340
this month? Does paranormal interest you?

1629
04:42:01,340 --> 04:42:03,340
Um, not at all.

1630
04:42:03,340 --> 04:42:06,220
We had a conversation

1631
04:42:06,220 --> 04:42:08,220
like a week or two ago about ghosts

1632
04:42:08,220 --> 04:42:10,220
and stuff and I don't really believe in the

1633
04:42:10,220 --> 04:42:12,220
term ghost in a

1634
04:42:12,220 --> 04:42:16,189
traditional sense.

1635
04:42:16,189 --> 04:42:18,189
Talked about how your great great great great great great

1636
04:42:18,189 --> 04:42:20,189
grandfather is like watching down and

1637
04:42:20,189 --> 04:42:22,189
walking around your house and eating

1638
04:42:22,189 --> 04:42:24,369
food out of your fridge.

1639
04:42:24,369 --> 04:42:26,369
It was a whole ordeal.

1640
04:42:26,369 --> 04:42:30,720
But I don't really believe in ghosts.

1641
04:42:30,720 --> 04:42:33,090
In the like,

1642
04:42:33,090 --> 04:42:35,459
I'm here

1643
04:42:35,459 --> 04:42:37,459
because

1644
04:42:37,459 --> 04:42:39,459
I have unfinished business

1645
04:42:39,459 --> 04:42:41,459
with you.

1646
04:42:41,459 --> 04:42:43,700
You screwed me out of the deal

1647
04:42:43,700 --> 04:42:45,700
and they literally won't leave your house like

1648
04:42:45,700 --> 04:42:47,700
Beetlejuice style. No, I don't I don't

1649
04:42:47,700 --> 04:42:57,229
think that's real.

1650
04:42:57,229 --> 04:42:59,229
Say Beetlejuice three times.

1651
04:42:59,229 --> 04:43:04,290
I will never do that.

1652
04:43:04,290 --> 04:43:07,680
That's what a ghost would say.

1653
04:43:07,680 --> 04:43:09,680
Look, but I can't prove that they don't exist

1654
04:43:09,680 --> 04:43:11,979
either, right?

1655
04:43:11,979 --> 04:43:13,979
I can't tell you guys.

1656
04:43:13,979 --> 04:43:15,979
We see a certain

1657
04:43:15,979 --> 04:43:18,740
spectrum of colors.

1658
04:43:18,740 --> 04:43:20,740
Who knows? There might be a whole other spectrum of light

1659
04:43:20,740 --> 04:43:22,740
that we can't see.

1660
04:43:22,740 --> 04:43:24,740
That's not like infrared. It might be something completely

1661
04:43:24,740 --> 04:43:26,740
different. There might be a whole world underneath

1662
04:43:26,740 --> 04:43:28,740
our world. I don't know. You can't see it.

1663
04:43:28,740 --> 04:43:39,419
I have no idea. Do I believe in aliens?

1664
04:43:39,419 --> 04:43:43,500
Um,

1665
04:43:43,500 --> 04:43:46,060
yeah, probably.

1666
04:43:46,060 --> 04:43:49,259
If there's 500 billion galaxies,

1667
04:43:49,259 --> 04:43:51,259
one of them is going to have a Starbucks

1668
04:43:51,259 --> 04:43:53,630
somewhere. There'll be something.

1669
04:43:53,630 --> 04:43:55,869
I mean, I don't think we'll ever, ever,

1670
04:43:55,869 --> 04:43:57,869
ever, ever talk to them.

1671
04:43:57,869 --> 04:44:11,360
We'll never see them, ever.

1672
04:44:11,360 --> 04:44:15,970
I don't know. Do you understand how

1673
04:44:15,970 --> 04:44:17,970
fucked up this whole world is? Like, the giraffe exists.

1674
04:44:17,970 --> 04:44:21,040
Nobody can

1675
04:44:21,040 --> 04:44:23,040
tell you anything. Nobody can explain

1676
04:44:23,040 --> 04:44:34,299
shit. You have

1677
04:44:34,299 --> 04:44:36,860
a series of tubes in your body

1678
04:44:36,860 --> 04:44:38,860
that carry a

1679
04:44:38,860 --> 04:44:40,860
substance around your whole body

1680
04:44:40,860 --> 04:44:45,599
to make sure you stay alive.

1681
04:44:45,599 --> 04:44:54,479
Huh? Electricity

1682
04:44:54,479 --> 04:44:56,479
is a thing. Like lightning strikes

1683
04:44:56,479 --> 04:44:59,680
from the sky. We're just

1684
04:44:59,680 --> 04:45:01,680
making our best guesses, guys.

1685
04:45:01,680 --> 04:45:03,680
It don't matter who you are.

1686
04:45:03,680 --> 04:45:08,349
Can you imagine trying to fucking

1687
04:45:08,349 --> 04:45:10,779
explain what the hell that is?

1688
04:45:10,779 --> 04:45:12,779
Boom! Lightning!

1689
04:45:12,779 --> 04:45:14,779
I have no

1690
04:45:14,779 --> 04:45:16,779
fucking idea what that was.

1691
04:45:16,779 --> 04:45:18,779
I guess we'll try to think what it

1692
04:45:18,779 --> 04:45:20,779
could... We'll figure it out, I guess.

1693
04:45:20,779 --> 04:45:25,259
Science can prove how it works, but science

1694
04:45:25,259 --> 04:45:27,259
can't prove, like,

1695
04:45:27,259 --> 04:45:29,439
why it doesn't... Why?

1696
04:45:29,439 --> 04:45:31,740
Why is it lightning?

1697
04:45:31,740 --> 04:45:33,740
Why do we have veins? Like, why did this happen?

1698
04:45:33,740 --> 04:45:35,740
What the fuck was this for?

1699
04:45:35,740 --> 04:45:45,090
It's called electric... I know what

1700
04:45:45,090 --> 04:45:47,580
electricity is, I'm just saying.

1701
04:45:47,580 --> 04:45:50,590
What? What? What?

1702
04:45:50,590 --> 04:45:52,590
You put gasoline in your car and you can drive

1703
04:45:52,590 --> 04:45:54,590
down the road. That... Why?

1704
04:45:54,590 --> 04:45:56,590
How did we get that far? You have a

1705
04:45:56,590 --> 04:46:00,430
flat-screen TV in your house. You're telling me

1706
04:46:00,430 --> 04:46:02,430
two to three hundred years ago, people would

1707
04:46:02,430 --> 04:46:04,430
fucking ride around in horse and

1708
04:46:04,430 --> 04:46:06,669
buggies? And you have an iPhone

1709
04:46:06,669 --> 04:46:14,860
in your pocket now? Maybe I do believe

1710
04:46:14,860 --> 04:46:16,860
in aliens. They fucking landed and they gave us

1711
04:46:16,860 --> 04:46:21,409
all the goddamn technology.

1712
04:46:21,409 --> 04:46:23,409
Imagine not knowing what thermodynamics

1713
04:46:23,409 --> 04:46:25,409
works. How... Thermodynamics

1714
04:46:25,409 --> 04:46:27,409
was a word that was made up to explain

1715
04:46:27,409 --> 04:46:34,770
what thermodynamics is.

1716
04:46:34,770 --> 04:46:40,459
It's all language.

1717
04:46:40,459 --> 04:46:51,650
But an eye-opening

1718
04:46:51,650 --> 04:47:01,439
string. Time isn't

1719
04:47:01,439 --> 04:47:04,319
real. Yeah, I guess

1720
04:47:04,319 --> 04:47:06,319
time is a concept that

1721
04:47:06,319 --> 04:47:08,319
we created to try to explain

1722
04:47:08,319 --> 04:47:10,319
why the sun goes up and down.

1723
04:47:10,319 --> 04:47:14,220
Two hundred IQ?

1724
04:47:14,220 --> 04:47:18,830
I tell you, sometimes it's

1725
04:47:18,830 --> 04:47:30,419
too easy. Can I tell you,

1726
04:47:30,419 --> 04:47:33,099
one of my favorite things

1727
04:47:33,099 --> 04:47:35,099
is verbal shitposting at the beginning

1728
04:47:35,099 --> 04:47:37,099
and the end of my streams.

1729
04:47:37,099 --> 04:47:39,099
It's so fun.

1730
04:47:39,099 --> 04:47:41,099
Now I get it. I know why you guys do it.

1731
04:47:41,099 --> 04:47:46,419
That's one of my favorite things in the world.

1732
04:47:46,419 --> 04:47:59,200
He understands.

1733
04:47:59,200 --> 04:48:01,200
You're always doing that. I don't

1734
04:48:01,200 --> 04:48:03,200
know. It's fun. It's fun just to

1735
04:48:03,200 --> 04:48:07,740
talk about random things.

1736
04:48:07,740 --> 04:48:13,950
Dad gets me. Mouth

1737
04:48:13,950 --> 04:48:21,889
diarrhea. Yeah.

1738
04:48:21,889 --> 04:48:23,889
Who's your favorite?

1739
04:48:23,889 --> 04:48:37,259
What's your favorite pantheon?

1740
04:48:37,259 --> 04:48:39,439
Norse. Norse. Greek.

1741
04:48:39,439 --> 04:48:42,130
Greek. Roman.

1742
04:48:42,130 --> 04:48:54,720
Are we going to get a smite stream? I'm

1743
04:48:54,720 --> 04:48:56,720
dumb and don't know what you mean.

1744
04:48:56,720 --> 04:49:01,009
Gods. Gods. Yeah, you do. They're all cool.

1745
04:49:01,009 --> 04:49:03,889
That's how people

1746
04:49:03,889 --> 04:49:06,900
explain the world.

1747
04:49:06,900 --> 04:49:08,900
Can you imagine if in

1748
04:49:08,900 --> 04:49:10,900
a thousand years they're looking back at us

1749
04:49:10,900 --> 04:49:12,900
talking about string theory and they're

1750
04:49:12,900 --> 04:49:14,900
laughing because it's as ridiculous

1751
04:49:14,900 --> 04:49:24,689
as Zeus?

1752
04:49:24,689 --> 04:49:31,220
They didn't know.

1753
04:49:31,220 --> 04:49:33,650
It's funny now.

1754
04:49:33,650 --> 04:49:35,650
All right. Hold on.

1755
04:49:35,650 --> 04:49:38,340
I don't want to turn a end of

1756
04:49:38,340 --> 04:49:40,340
the stream shitpost into a let's debate

1757
04:49:40,340 --> 04:49:45,709
science for real.

1758
04:49:45,709 --> 04:49:47,709
Anyways, I don't know how it got there. Somebody

1759
04:49:47,709 --> 04:49:52,450
said something. But anyways,

1760
04:49:52,450 --> 04:49:57,380
let's go. Let's do it for real.

1761
04:49:57,380 --> 04:49:59,380
Lizard Amiibo, thanks

1762
04:49:59,380 --> 04:50:01,380
for the 500 bits. Hey, Jerma, I just started my

1763
04:50:01,380 --> 04:50:03,380
first year of college and so far it's been pretty

1764
04:50:03,380 --> 04:50:05,380
rough. The streams and videos are

1765
04:50:05,380 --> 04:50:07,380
one of the things that have been able to make me smile.

1766
04:50:07,380 --> 04:50:09,380
The time, effort,

1767
04:50:09,380 --> 04:50:11,380
and why is this cut off?

1768
04:50:11,380 --> 04:50:17,060
Streamlabs, I'm telling

1769
04:50:17,060 --> 04:50:19,060
you. You got, you made

1770
04:50:19,060 --> 04:50:21,060
this new update.

1771
04:50:21,060 --> 04:50:23,549
But

1772
04:50:23,549 --> 04:50:26,430
you're cutting off everything now.

1773
04:50:26,430 --> 04:50:28,430
Why are you cutting everything off?

1774
04:50:28,430 --> 04:50:30,930
This is this new

1775
04:50:30,930 --> 04:50:33,229
mini feed.

1776
04:50:33,229 --> 04:50:35,229
Not good. I'm not happy with this.

1777
04:50:35,229 --> 04:50:39,569
Huh. Mini feed

1778
04:50:39,569 --> 04:50:41,569
cuts off everything. How do I just make it the regular

1779
04:50:41,569 --> 04:50:44,000
feed? What have we done?

1780
04:50:44,000 --> 04:50:52,180
Hold on. I

1781
04:50:52,180 --> 04:50:55,119
think, I think, I think

1782
04:50:55,119 --> 04:50:57,119
I think I'm going to dump Streamlabs

1783
04:50:57,119 --> 04:51:00,319
OBS. Yeah,

1784
04:51:00,319 --> 04:51:02,319
not, not doing

1785
04:51:02,319 --> 04:51:07,439
it for me. Not doing

1786
04:51:07,439 --> 04:51:09,439
it for me at all actually.

1787
04:51:09,439 --> 04:51:19,139
Go here. Good.

1788
04:51:19,139 --> 04:51:21,139
It's a bunch of great, interesting

1789
04:51:21,139 --> 04:51:23,139
ideas that all of them just kind of don't

1790
04:51:23,139 --> 04:51:25,139
work at the same time together.

1791
04:51:25,139 --> 04:51:30,130
I'm going to, I'm just going to go back to the regular

1792
04:51:30,130 --> 04:51:32,130
Streamlabs. Not Streamlabs, regular OBS.

1793
04:51:32,130 --> 04:51:34,689
Apparently it's some really

1794
04:51:34,689 --> 04:51:36,689
cool features that they added.

1795
04:51:36,689 --> 04:51:49,229
OBS vanilla flavor, yes.

1796
04:51:49,229 --> 04:51:55,700
Logitech bought Streamlabs.

1797
04:51:55,700 --> 04:52:00,819
That's kind

1798
04:52:00,819 --> 04:52:04,139
of interesting I guess, yeah.

1799
04:52:04,139 --> 04:52:09,970
That's kind of interesting. That explains

1800
04:52:09,970 --> 04:52:13,490
a lot, does it? They're just trying

1801
04:52:13,490 --> 04:52:15,490
to load too much in the same place and then

1802
04:52:15,490 --> 04:52:17,729
I don't know. I could

1803
04:52:17,729 --> 04:52:19,729
talk about how I don't like it but it's

1804
04:52:19,729 --> 04:52:21,729
fine. Just don't use it.

1805
04:52:21,729 --> 04:52:23,729
It's that simple. Anyways, alright,

1806
04:52:23,729 --> 04:52:26,159
let's go back to what we were doing.

1807
04:52:26,159 --> 04:52:28,159
We had, we had five community

1808
04:52:28,159 --> 04:52:30,159
subs from Snooze and Copter at the very beginning

1809
04:52:30,159 --> 04:52:37,069
of the stream. We also had

1810
04:52:37,069 --> 04:52:39,069
Cyclops Parker

1811
04:52:39,069 --> 04:52:44,060
gave ten community subs

1812
04:52:44,060 --> 04:52:46,060
three, four hours ago here. Thanks to the ten community

1813
04:52:46,060 --> 04:52:50,860
subs. Also Zake,

1814
04:52:50,860 --> 04:52:52,860
this is where we left off here. Zake, thanks for the 250. Hey

1815
04:52:52,860 --> 04:52:54,860
man, thanks for providing a nice distraction from student

1816
04:52:54,860 --> 04:52:56,860
stress. How are you? Are you enjoying

1817
04:52:56,860 --> 04:52:58,860
streaming? Cheers from

1818
04:52:58,860 --> 04:53:00,860
5,390 miles away.

1819
04:53:00,860 --> 04:53:04,189
I love streaming. Streaming's like one of my

1820
04:53:04,189 --> 04:53:08,799
favorite things ever. I would say

1821
04:53:08,799 --> 04:53:15,330
streaming is, it's

1822
04:53:15,330 --> 04:53:17,330
one of my main focuses of my

1823
04:53:17,330 --> 04:53:23,470
whole life. So greetings from

1824
04:53:23,470 --> 04:53:25,470
5,400 miles away.

1825
04:53:25,470 --> 04:53:27,470
That's really far, I wonder

1826
04:53:27,470 --> 04:53:32,270
where is that? I missed two hundred dollars

1827
04:53:32,270 --> 04:53:34,450
right now? Oh

1828
04:53:34,450 --> 04:53:36,450
earlier, okay, yeah. It was from

1829
04:53:36,450 --> 04:53:38,450
Vilemi. Two hundred dollars

1830
04:53:38,450 --> 04:53:40,450
twenty thousand bits

1831
04:53:40,450 --> 04:53:43,009
from about

1832
04:53:43,009 --> 04:53:45,180
five minutes ago or so

1833
04:53:45,180 --> 04:53:47,810
we were talking about like

1834
04:53:47,810 --> 04:53:49,810
the blood vessels in your body and how that means

1835
04:53:49,810 --> 04:53:51,810
that like aliens landed. I don't know.

1836
04:53:51,810 --> 04:53:53,810
A bunch of people left and probably thought I was like actually

1837
04:53:53,810 --> 04:53:56,430
a fucking weirdo. Oh, whatever.

1838
04:53:56,430 --> 04:53:58,669
That's okay. Thanks

1839
04:53:58,669 --> 04:54:00,669
for the 200 bucks though. That's a lot of money, Vilemi.

1840
04:54:00,669 --> 04:54:02,669
It's a shitload of money.

1841
04:54:02,669 --> 04:54:05,869
At the same time, just to dump

1842
04:54:05,869 --> 04:54:07,869
two hundred twenty thousand bits.

1843
04:54:07,869 --> 04:54:10,689
True.

1844
04:54:10,689 --> 04:54:16,639
But Vilemi, fuck yeah, that's a lot of

1845
04:54:16,639 --> 04:54:19,009
money. And they say germ

1846
04:54:19,009 --> 04:54:21,500
A-W-O-O

1847
04:54:21,500 --> 04:54:23,500
Germ-O-Woo

1848
04:54:23,500 --> 04:54:25,810
I'm re- I'm reading it!

1849
04:54:25,810 --> 04:54:31,889
Tell us when the next carnival's gonna be. There's not gonna be

1850
04:54:31,889 --> 04:54:33,889
a carnival with it but you stream on the 31st

1851
04:54:33,889 --> 04:54:35,889
or at least on the 30th or 31st.

1852
04:54:35,889 --> 04:54:38,130
Doing a Halloween stream

1853
04:54:38,130 --> 04:54:40,130
that's gonna have a lot of intricate details to it so

1854
04:54:40,130 --> 04:54:42,130
go check out the Discord. There's a couple

1855
04:54:42,130 --> 04:54:44,500
channels there. Go read the pin messages

1856
04:54:44,500 --> 04:54:48,529
and you'll know what's gonna happen.

1857
04:54:48,529 --> 04:54:51,860
But thanks a lot, Vilemi. That brings us back

1858
04:54:51,860 --> 04:54:57,740
down. Let's go back down to

1859
04:54:57,740 --> 04:55:04,340
right down here. But Lizard Amiibo,

1860
04:55:04,340 --> 04:55:06,340
thank you. Sorry to hear that your first

1861
04:55:06,340 --> 04:55:08,340
year of college is rough.

1862
04:55:08,340 --> 04:55:10,340
It can happen like that though.

1863
04:55:10,340 --> 04:55:13,020
The first year or so

1864
04:55:13,020 --> 04:55:15,020
is very nerve wracking for everybody.

1865
04:55:15,020 --> 04:55:17,389
So you kind of just need to

1866
04:55:17,389 --> 04:55:19,389
keep going, try to

1867
04:55:19,389 --> 04:55:21,389
make some friends, and try to make

1868
04:55:21,389 --> 04:55:23,389
the best of your college experience.

1869
04:55:23,389 --> 04:55:29,900
It can be a lot of fun. Just make sure you

1870
04:55:29,900 --> 04:55:31,900
are taking care of your work, taking care of your

1871
04:55:31,900 --> 04:55:33,900
life. It can be a good time.

1872
04:55:33,900 --> 04:55:37,229
But the first year always is

1873
04:55:37,229 --> 04:55:39,540
a big kind of

1874
04:55:39,540 --> 04:55:41,540
shock for a lot of people.

1875
04:55:41,540 --> 04:55:45,119
But you'll shake off the cobwebs.

1876
04:55:45,119 --> 04:55:50,669
I wish you the best of luck. Thank you

1877
04:55:50,669 --> 04:55:52,669
Snooze for the 250. Hey Germ, I just want to say that your streams

1878
04:55:52,669 --> 04:55:54,669
have always cheered me up and made me laugh.

1879
04:55:54,669 --> 04:55:56,669
You are genuinely kind and humble.

1880
04:55:56,669 --> 04:55:58,849
It inspires me to be the same way.

1881
04:55:58,849 --> 04:56:00,849
Anyways, enough being cheesy, I made some

1882
04:56:00,849 --> 04:56:02,849
fan art for you recently. I can't wait for the next

1883
04:56:02,849 --> 04:56:04,849
Community Content Night so you can

1884
04:56:04,849 --> 04:56:07,979
see it. Goodnight. Yeah?

1885
04:56:07,979 --> 04:56:11,360
Toss it in there.

1886
04:56:11,360 --> 04:56:13,360
The next time we do it, I'm sure it'll be there.

1887
04:56:13,360 --> 04:56:17,709
I appreciate the incredibly kind messages

1888
04:56:17,709 --> 04:56:25,250
though. Thank you Snooze.

1889
04:56:25,250 --> 04:56:27,250
And speaking of Community Content Night, I'm going to be

1890
04:56:27,250 --> 04:56:30,189
adding much more

1891
04:56:30,189 --> 04:56:32,189
material to pull from for you guys

1892
04:56:32,189 --> 04:56:35,900
that make videos. I will say it again,

1893
04:56:35,900 --> 04:56:37,900
I've said it the last few streams in a row.

1894
04:56:37,900 --> 04:56:39,900
I'm going back in front of the green

1895
04:56:39,900 --> 04:56:41,900
screen for a whole stream.

1896
04:56:41,900 --> 04:56:43,900
We're going to do a whole other thing where

1897
04:56:43,900 --> 04:56:45,900
we pull a ton of suggestions

1898
04:56:45,900 --> 04:56:47,900
and we do green screen DLC

1899
04:56:47,900 --> 04:56:49,900
for free.

1900
04:56:49,900 --> 04:56:51,900
That's the title of the stream. I've got it

1901
04:56:51,900 --> 04:56:53,900
already like a month and a half in advance.

1902
04:56:53,900 --> 04:57:00,819
I already know that's what the title is.

1903
04:57:00,819 --> 04:57:02,819
Hey Lude Sheep, thanks for the 300 bits. Hey

1904
04:57:02,819 --> 04:57:04,819
Germ, we just want to say hello from all of us at the Sprio

1905
04:57:04,819 --> 04:57:07,630
Discord channel. Hello from

1906
04:57:07,630 --> 04:57:09,630
there. Nice to see you.

1907
04:57:09,630 --> 04:57:11,869
They say, oh and

1908
04:57:11,869 --> 04:57:13,869
Postposs says

1909
04:57:13,869 --> 04:57:16,299
hey as well. Postposs

1910
04:57:16,299 --> 04:57:22,380
one. Hi guys.

1911
04:57:22,380 --> 04:57:24,380
Thank you Lude Sheep. And hello

1912
04:57:24,380 --> 04:57:26,380
everybody at that Discord. Whoever you are.

1913
04:57:26,380 --> 04:57:29,779
Wherever you are. Thank you.

1914
04:57:29,779 --> 04:57:33,169
Sir Canine, thanks for the 250. Louis Anderson

1915
04:57:33,169 --> 04:57:35,169
Human Garfield is probably one of the most terrifying

1916
04:57:35,169 --> 04:57:39,069
creations in human history.

1917
04:57:39,069 --> 04:57:41,069
What happened to that guy? That guy just kind of disappeared.

1918
04:57:41,069 --> 04:57:45,229
I wanted more of the

1919
04:57:45,229 --> 04:57:47,229
Grenade Eater. But we're not going to

1920
04:57:47,229 --> 04:57:52,740
get it. Hey Shiggy, thanks for the

1921
04:57:52,740 --> 04:57:57,659
250.

1922
04:57:57,659 --> 04:57:59,659
Hey Germ, I wonder if you consider yourself a

1923
04:57:59,659 --> 04:58:02,669
what is this? What is this word?

1924
04:58:02,669 --> 04:58:06,700
What do you have to say about the fans

1925
04:58:06,700 --> 04:58:09,069
proclaiming you are a model

1926
04:58:09,069 --> 04:58:17,650
H? What is this?

1927
04:58:17,650 --> 04:58:19,650
Yeah, what is that? What does it

1928
04:58:19,650 --> 04:58:33,979
mean? It means

1929
04:58:33,979 --> 04:58:37,380
stupid but handsome.

1930
04:58:37,380 --> 04:58:39,380
Well those people are the ones that stuck around for

1931
04:58:39,380 --> 04:58:41,380
the post stream.

1932
04:58:41,380 --> 04:58:43,380
There are tubes in your body. Rant.

1933
04:58:43,380 --> 04:58:45,380
And then they left.

1934
04:58:45,380 --> 04:58:47,380
And that's the only piece of the content they watched. They missed the part

1935
04:58:47,380 --> 04:58:50,450
when I talked about the

1936
04:58:50,450 --> 04:59:01,009
Well, whatever.

1937
04:59:01,009 --> 04:59:03,630
Himbo.

1938
04:59:03,630 --> 04:59:05,630
Okay, I don't

1939
04:59:05,630 --> 04:59:09,090
What do I have to say about that?

1940
04:59:09,090 --> 04:59:16,000
I got a degree. I went to engineering

1941
04:59:16,000 --> 04:59:25,659
school. I was a waiter

1942
04:59:25,659 --> 04:59:27,659
for three years.

1943
04:59:27,659 --> 04:59:31,889
What are the more made up

1944
04:59:31,889 --> 04:59:33,889
things around the wiki page?

1945
04:59:33,889 --> 04:59:42,139
I wonder. Why don't you look at chat during

1946
04:59:42,139 --> 04:59:44,900
the stream? I look at chat

1947
04:59:44,900 --> 04:59:46,900
so much during the stream that it makes me step in bear traps.

1948
04:59:46,900 --> 04:59:48,900
500 times.

1949
04:59:48,900 --> 05:00:01,180
I'm just speaking in reality.

1950
05:00:01,180 --> 05:00:06,619
That's a nice excuse.

1951
05:00:06,619 --> 05:00:08,619
It is a pretty good excuse.

1952
05:00:08,619 --> 05:00:10,619
I mean it's surely, absolutely

1953
05:00:10,619 --> 05:00:12,619
an excuse but it's a pretty good one.

1954
05:00:12,619 --> 05:00:16,779
Hey Warm Like Biscuits, thanks for the

1955
05:00:16,779 --> 05:00:18,779
500 bits.

1956
05:00:18,779 --> 05:00:20,779
I've been watching you since your early YouTube days.

1957
05:00:20,779 --> 05:00:22,779
Thank you for all the laughs. You've pulled me out of some

1958
05:00:22,779 --> 05:00:24,779
dark places. Here's a little bit of gratitude

1959
05:00:24,779 --> 05:00:27,860
so thank you. Thank you

1960
05:00:27,860 --> 05:00:29,860
Warm Like Biscuits.

1961
05:00:29,860 --> 05:00:38,990
I'm glad you can laugh.

1962
05:00:38,990 --> 05:00:40,990
I love laughing. It's one of my favorite things in the world.

1963
05:00:40,990 --> 05:00:43,939
Hey guess what?

1964
05:00:43,939 --> 05:00:46,560
Laughing at shit has

1965
05:00:46,560 --> 05:00:48,560
pulled me out of some places that I never

1966
05:00:48,560 --> 05:00:51,380
really wanted to be in over the

1967
05:00:51,380 --> 05:00:54,830
course of my life. I think it's so

1968
05:00:54,830 --> 05:00:56,830
important. I think

1969
05:00:56,830 --> 05:00:58,830
laughing and having a good time.

1970
05:00:58,830 --> 05:01:00,830
Jokes. I think comedy

1971
05:01:00,830 --> 05:01:02,830
is one of the most important things.

1972
05:01:02,830 --> 05:01:05,259
If you can pull comedy out of any

1973
05:01:05,259 --> 05:01:07,259
situation or situations

1974
05:01:07,259 --> 05:01:10,639
and everybody can laugh

1975
05:01:10,639 --> 05:01:16,979
I think it's incredibly important.

1976
05:01:16,979 --> 05:01:19,659
It's the best medicine. Well it's a good

1977
05:01:19,659 --> 05:01:22,540
supplement. It's a good supplement to medicine.

1978
05:01:22,540 --> 05:01:25,869
I'd probably say that's more accurate.

1979
05:01:25,869 --> 05:01:34,060
We're talking comedy here.

1980
05:01:34,060 --> 05:01:37,840
Yeah I think it's

1981
05:01:37,840 --> 05:01:39,840
a very important thing so

1982
05:01:39,840 --> 05:01:41,840
if anybody gets that out of this stream then that makes me

1983
05:01:41,840 --> 05:01:43,840
really happy because that's obviously

1984
05:01:43,840 --> 05:01:45,840
I find that to be something that I care so much about

1985
05:01:45,840 --> 05:01:48,340
in my life. So I'm

1986
05:01:48,340 --> 05:01:50,340
glad it translates to a lot of you.

1987
05:01:50,340 --> 05:01:52,509
That makes me really happy.

1988
05:01:52,509 --> 05:01:59,220
Thanks a lot. Hey Sad Vega

1989
05:01:59,220 --> 05:02:01,220
thanks for the 250.

1990
05:02:01,220 --> 05:02:03,220
Question about the slime night.

1991
05:02:03,220 --> 05:02:05,220
Okay. That's going to be the 31st

1992
05:02:05,220 --> 05:02:07,220
right? Also how are you handling

1993
05:02:07,220 --> 05:02:09,220
the slime? Because I'd expect it's going to create a mess

1994
05:02:09,220 --> 05:02:11,220
on your gear and your headphones.

1995
05:02:11,220 --> 05:02:13,220
Are you saran wrapping your home room?

1996
05:02:13,220 --> 05:02:15,220
Doing it in a studio I cannot imagine how

1997
05:02:15,220 --> 05:02:17,220
awful getting the slime out of the equipment be.

1998
05:02:17,220 --> 05:02:19,889
You'll see.

1999
05:02:19,889 --> 05:02:22,450
It's not going to

2000
05:02:22,450 --> 05:02:24,880
be in my room.

2001
05:02:24,880 --> 05:02:26,880
So don't worry. That's not

2002
05:02:26,880 --> 05:02:31,549
going to happen. There is

2003
05:02:31,549 --> 05:02:33,549
a whole

2004
05:02:33,549 --> 05:02:35,549
the last week and a half

2005
05:02:35,549 --> 05:02:37,549
or so since I first started talking about it

2006
05:02:37,549 --> 05:02:39,549
has been complete and total planning.

2007
05:02:39,549 --> 05:02:41,549
Every day that I'm not on stream essentially.

2008
05:02:41,549 --> 05:02:44,110
And it's almost

2009
05:02:44,110 --> 05:02:46,110
ready to go completely. So

2010
05:02:46,110 --> 05:02:48,290
don't worry. That is completely

2011
05:02:48,290 --> 05:02:52,060
and totally taken care of.

2012
05:02:52,060 --> 05:02:54,060
He's going to do it on his bed. No that's

2013
05:02:54,060 --> 05:02:56,430
not where this is going to be. But

2014
05:02:56,430 --> 05:02:58,610
yes it's supposed to be

2015
05:02:58,610 --> 05:03:00,610
on Halloween. Halloween

2016
05:03:00,610 --> 05:03:03,360
day. I know a lot of people

2017
05:03:03,360 --> 05:03:05,360
have things to do on Halloween night usually.

2018
05:03:05,360 --> 05:03:07,540
So it's going to be Halloween

2019
05:03:07,540 --> 05:03:09,540
afternoon into

2020
05:03:09,540 --> 05:03:11,540
Halloween evening.

2021
05:03:11,540 --> 05:03:18,319
Should be fun. And it's not just

2022
05:03:18,319 --> 05:03:20,319
going to be a slime stream. Let me make that

2023
05:03:20,319 --> 05:03:22,319
really clear. There's at least two or three

2024
05:03:22,319 --> 05:03:24,689
segments on that stream that are

2025
05:03:24,689 --> 05:03:26,689
not sliming. There are other things

2026
05:03:26,689 --> 05:03:28,689
that could be Halloween related.

2027
05:03:28,689 --> 05:03:31,500
Slime is just the main event.

2028
05:03:31,500 --> 05:03:37,060
You know how we do it. Mind my halo

2029
05:03:37,060 --> 05:03:39,060
thanks for the ten dollars thousand

2030
05:03:39,060 --> 05:03:41,060
bits. There's no message but

2031
05:03:41,060 --> 05:03:43,060
just thank you for the ten dollar

2032
05:03:43,060 --> 05:03:49,650
drop. Thank you shitty viewbot

2033
05:03:49,650 --> 05:03:51,650
for the five hundred bits. Last time you mentioned

2034
05:03:51,650 --> 05:03:53,650
Scream Fortress you said ask me again.

2035
05:03:53,650 --> 05:03:55,650
Well I'm asking you again. Is there any chance for

2036
05:03:55,650 --> 05:03:57,650
a TF2 Scream Fortress stream?

2037
05:03:57,650 --> 05:04:01,659
No. I will

2038
05:04:01,659 --> 05:04:03,659
probably not stream

2039
05:04:03,659 --> 05:04:05,970
Team Fortress 2 ever again.

2040
05:04:05,970 --> 05:04:12,220
I don't think so.

2041
05:04:12,220 --> 05:04:14,220
Like I said before there would need to

2042
05:04:14,220 --> 05:04:16,220
be a

2043
05:04:16,220 --> 05:04:18,220
significant major

2044
05:04:18,220 --> 05:04:20,220
change to the game for me to get

2045
05:04:20,220 --> 05:04:22,220
interested in it again. Because let's be

2046
05:04:22,220 --> 05:04:24,220
completely and totally honest here.

2047
05:04:24,220 --> 05:04:26,220
Scream Fortress is just

2048
05:04:26,220 --> 05:04:28,400
it's the Halloween update.

2049
05:04:28,400 --> 05:04:30,400
It's not like a major

2050
05:04:30,400 --> 05:04:32,400
change to the game. It's a

2051
05:04:32,400 --> 05:04:34,400
few cool maps and some cosmetics

2052
05:04:34,400 --> 05:04:36,400
and stuff. It's not

2053
05:04:36,400 --> 05:04:38,770
it's not anything that's like a big big

2054
05:04:38,770 --> 05:04:40,770
big major change.

2055
05:04:40,770 --> 05:04:44,740
And even when sometimes they've done

2056
05:04:44,740 --> 05:04:46,740
updates that have brought a couple

2057
05:04:46,740 --> 05:04:48,740
of new items and a couple of new scenarios

2058
05:04:48,740 --> 05:04:50,740
it's what it kind of

2059
05:04:50,740 --> 05:04:53,099
wasn't enough. You have to

2060
05:04:53,099 --> 05:04:55,099
remember I put

2061
05:04:55,099 --> 05:04:57,099
almost

2062
05:04:57,099 --> 05:04:59,099
six seven straight years

2063
05:04:59,099 --> 05:05:01,099
into that game.

2064
05:05:01,099 --> 05:05:04,500
And I sort of closed the book on it.

2065
05:05:04,500 --> 05:05:06,500
There are other things that I'd like to do

2066
05:05:06,500 --> 05:05:13,979
that are not that

2067
05:05:13,979 --> 05:05:17,950
he hates it.

2068
05:05:17,950 --> 05:05:19,950
No but it's kind of it's one of those scenarios

2069
05:05:19,950 --> 05:05:21,950
where I like to look back

2070
05:05:21,950 --> 05:05:23,950
at how awesome that community was

2071
05:05:23,950 --> 05:05:26,580
and how amazing those

2072
05:05:26,580 --> 05:05:28,580
five plus straight years of my life were.

2073
05:05:28,580 --> 05:05:31,459
I put a lot

2074
05:05:31,459 --> 05:05:33,459
I was playing TF2 before

2075
05:05:33,459 --> 05:05:35,459
Steam even counted the hours.

2076
05:05:35,459 --> 05:05:37,459
And that's when I spent the most time in it.

2077
05:05:37,459 --> 05:05:42,580
But I don't think there would be a scenario

2078
05:05:42,580 --> 05:05:44,580
where it'd be like hey here's like a

2079
05:05:44,580 --> 05:05:46,580
TF2 livestream.

2080
05:05:46,580 --> 05:05:49,009
I don't really have any

2081
05:05:49,009 --> 05:05:51,009
that's not like doing it for me.

2082
05:05:51,009 --> 05:05:53,180
Like it could have maybe

2083
05:05:53,180 --> 05:05:55,619
used to years ago.

2084
05:05:55,619 --> 05:06:07,459
You want to see TF2 get the love it deserves

2085
05:06:07,459 --> 05:06:10,779
from Valve?

2086
05:06:10,779 --> 05:06:12,779
Yeah but that would mean Valve would

2087
05:06:12,779 --> 05:06:14,779
Valve has not been very game

2088
05:06:14,779 --> 05:06:16,779
centric over the last

2089
05:06:16,779 --> 05:06:18,779
five years.

2090
05:06:18,779 --> 05:06:20,779
They've been more hardware and business centric.

2091
05:06:20,779 --> 05:06:22,779
And it's done

2092
05:06:22,779 --> 05:06:25,090
really well for them.

2093
05:06:25,090 --> 05:06:27,090
Everybody wants Valve to make games

2094
05:06:27,090 --> 05:06:29,090
but Valve has done

2095
05:06:29,090 --> 05:06:31,090
has changed

2096
05:06:31,090 --> 05:06:33,090
they're just incredibly lucrative

2097
05:06:33,090 --> 05:06:35,090
when they focused on Steam

2098
05:06:35,090 --> 05:06:37,840
and the VR stuff.

2099
05:06:37,840 --> 05:06:40,020
If they ever actually

2100
05:06:40,020 --> 05:06:42,020
and they're supposed to be

2101
05:06:42,020 --> 05:06:44,020
they're supposed to be developing something for VR.

2102
05:06:44,020 --> 05:06:51,889
That's what everyone says right?

2103
05:06:51,889 --> 05:06:53,889
Half Life 3 VR. I know that's

2104
05:06:53,889 --> 05:06:55,889
the thing that everyone says now.

2105
05:06:55,889 --> 05:06:58,450
And even if it's not

2106
05:06:58,450 --> 05:07:00,880
they're doing something.

2107
05:07:00,880 --> 05:07:02,880
But it would take something significant.

2108
05:07:02,880 --> 05:07:04,880
Valve would have to really decide

2109
05:07:04,880 --> 05:07:06,880
that something like Team Fortress was

2110
05:07:06,880 --> 05:07:09,250
alright we're going to go back

2111
05:07:09,250 --> 05:07:11,250
to TF2 and we're going to develop

2112
05:07:11,250 --> 05:07:13,250
like six new official maps.

2113
05:07:13,250 --> 05:07:15,250
We're going to make a new game mode

2114
05:07:15,250 --> 05:07:17,250
and it's going to be 12 new items

2115
05:07:17,250 --> 05:07:19,250
and we're going to rebalance a bunch more stuff.

2116
05:07:19,250 --> 05:07:22,189
But it's almost it's hard for that to

2117
05:07:22,189 --> 05:07:24,189
even happen because at what point

2118
05:07:24,189 --> 05:07:26,189
is it they've added so

2119
05:07:26,189 --> 05:07:28,189
much stuff to TF2.

2120
05:07:28,189 --> 05:07:30,189
They've done they've added

2121
05:07:30,189 --> 05:07:32,189
so many items

2122
05:07:32,189 --> 05:07:34,189
and weapons and game modes

2123
05:07:34,189 --> 05:07:36,189
and maps and at what

2124
05:07:36,189 --> 05:07:38,189
point do they not have very much

2125
05:07:38,189 --> 05:07:45,229
else to do.

2126
05:07:45,229 --> 05:07:47,540
They've added whole class

2127
05:07:47,540 --> 05:07:49,540
whole new class worth

2128
05:07:49,540 --> 05:07:56,770
of items dozens of times.

2129
05:07:56,770 --> 05:07:58,770
So it's almost like I know everyone's oh man

2130
05:07:58,770 --> 05:08:00,770
I wish Valve would make like 25

2131
05:08:00,770 --> 05:08:02,770
new weapons and items

2132
05:08:02,770 --> 05:08:05,200
but they've already come up with so many

2133
05:08:05,200 --> 05:08:07,200
and in the scheme the grand scheme of what

2134
05:08:07,200 --> 05:08:10,340
that game is it's not

2135
05:08:10,340 --> 05:08:12,700
that you're limited it's that

2136
05:08:12,700 --> 05:08:14,700
they've done probably so much

2137
05:08:14,700 --> 05:08:16,700
stuff that they can't really probably come up

2138
05:08:16,700 --> 05:08:18,700
with what the hell are we going to give

2139
05:08:18,700 --> 05:08:21,779
like the fucking spy.

2140
05:08:21,779 --> 05:08:23,779
He's got like 12 15 different

2141
05:08:23,779 --> 05:08:30,619
knives and guns and

2142
05:08:30,619 --> 05:08:36,580
give him a fire knife a

2143
05:08:36,580 --> 05:08:39,069
knife gun yeah

2144
05:08:39,069 --> 05:08:42,590
and that's the thing though that when they come up with this many

2145
05:08:42,590 --> 05:08:44,590
things they come up with so many items and weapons

2146
05:08:44,590 --> 05:08:46,590
he's got like a bunch of revolvers and people only use

2147
05:08:46,590 --> 05:08:55,419
one or two of them.

2148
05:08:55,419 --> 05:08:57,419
I think the era of TF2

2149
05:08:57,419 --> 05:08:59,419
and here's the thing about

2150
05:08:59,419 --> 05:09:03,069
TF2 TF2

2151
05:09:03,069 --> 05:09:05,069
everybody wants to emulate how

2152
05:09:05,069 --> 05:09:07,069
fun that game is and how much

2153
05:09:07,069 --> 05:09:09,069
awesome it was and how everybody

2154
05:09:09,069 --> 05:09:11,069
cared about it. You see

2155
05:09:11,069 --> 05:09:13,069
so many games pop up now that are just

2156
05:09:13,069 --> 05:09:15,069
desperately trying to tap that

2157
05:09:15,069 --> 05:09:17,069
fun interesting

2158
05:09:17,069 --> 05:09:19,069
funny community

2159
05:09:19,069 --> 05:09:21,069
game and it's almost impossible.

2160
05:09:21,069 --> 05:09:31,439
There was a string

2161
05:09:31,439 --> 05:09:33,439
of at least a few years in a row

2162
05:09:33,439 --> 05:09:35,439
back in like 2013

2163
05:09:35,439 --> 05:09:37,439
14 15 into like 2016

2164
05:09:37,439 --> 05:09:39,439
where everyone wanted to be

2165
05:09:39,439 --> 05:09:41,439
everyone wanted to make that next awesome

2166
05:09:41,439 --> 05:09:43,439
Team Fortress style game that

2167
05:09:43,439 --> 05:09:45,439
everyone cared about but

2168
05:09:45,439 --> 05:09:47,740
yeah somebody just said it's a timeless

2169
05:09:47,740 --> 05:09:49,740
masterpiece it is.

2170
05:09:49,740 --> 05:09:51,740
So that's why it's hard to do another

2171
05:09:51,740 --> 05:09:53,740
one and I think that's why they're afraid to do

2172
05:09:53,740 --> 05:09:55,740
another one maybe not afraid it's the wrong word

2173
05:09:55,740 --> 05:09:58,180
but when you make something that's so

2174
05:09:58,180 --> 05:10:00,180
good that from its

2175
05:10:00,180 --> 05:10:02,180
when it was from release

2176
05:10:02,180 --> 05:10:04,180
to all through all these updates

2177
05:10:04,180 --> 05:10:06,180
and it is a actual

2178
05:10:06,180 --> 05:10:08,180
like first person shooter

2179
05:10:08,180 --> 05:10:10,180
solidified in history as

2180
05:10:10,180 --> 05:10:12,180
one of the best that has been ever made

2181
05:10:12,180 --> 05:10:14,180
so you have to make another one

2182
05:10:14,180 --> 05:10:16,180
and you have to make it as good or better than

2183
05:10:16,180 --> 05:10:19,250
that one. It's a

2184
05:10:19,250 --> 05:10:21,619
lot of pressure and a lot

2185
05:10:21,619 --> 05:10:23,619
of work to try to stand on

2186
05:10:23,619 --> 05:10:27,779
your own shoulders but we'll

2187
05:10:27,779 --> 05:10:35,389
see what they do and people will if

2188
05:10:35,389 --> 05:10:37,389
Team Fortress 3 gets announced

2189
05:10:37,389 --> 05:10:40,080
can you imagine how

2190
05:10:40,080 --> 05:10:42,080
everybody will everyone will be so

2191
05:10:42,080 --> 05:10:44,080
excited for it oh this is gonna be

2192
05:10:44,080 --> 05:10:46,080
the best game ever made it's a new

2193
05:10:46,080 --> 05:10:48,080
engine they're doing source 3 it's gonna

2194
05:10:48,080 --> 05:10:50,080
launch source 3 they've got like

2195
05:10:50,080 --> 05:10:52,080
two new classes and look

2196
05:10:52,080 --> 05:10:54,080
at all these new maps and there's like a whole

2197
05:10:54,080 --> 05:10:56,080
MVM new single player it's gonna be so good

2198
05:10:56,080 --> 05:10:58,080
if that game is not the

2199
05:10:58,080 --> 05:11:00,080
best game you've ever played

2200
05:11:00,080 --> 05:11:03,729
if it has to hit that expectation

2201
05:11:03,729 --> 05:11:05,729
otherwise it's just ah

2202
05:11:05,729 --> 05:11:07,729
fuck it wasn't really

2203
05:11:07,729 --> 05:11:10,099
that good I wish they didn't

2204
05:11:10,099 --> 05:11:12,099
do it in the first place then you think look at Diablo 3

2205
05:11:12,099 --> 05:11:15,360
do you know how long

2206
05:11:15,360 --> 05:11:17,360
I've wanted Diablo 3 for

2207
05:11:17,360 --> 05:11:19,540
Diablo 3

2208
05:11:19,540 --> 05:11:21,540
Diablo 2 is one of my favorite games ever made it's one of

2209
05:11:21,540 --> 05:11:23,540
my favorite fucking games I love it

2210
05:11:23,540 --> 05:11:26,220
so much and every

2211
05:11:26,220 --> 05:11:28,220
day I prayed for a Diablo

2212
05:11:28,220 --> 05:11:30,220
3 I thought about all the new

2213
05:11:30,220 --> 05:11:32,220
items they would be making a new

2214
05:11:32,220 --> 05:11:34,220
engine oh it would be so great

2215
05:11:34,220 --> 05:11:36,220
there would be endless content

2216
05:11:36,220 --> 05:11:38,220
there would be so much awesome shit you could do

2217
05:11:38,220 --> 05:11:40,220
just give us Diablo 3 please

2218
05:11:40,220 --> 05:11:42,220
and it's almost like

2219
05:11:42,220 --> 05:11:44,220
the monkey's paw right

2220
05:11:44,220 --> 05:11:47,229
like you got it

2221
05:11:47,229 --> 05:11:49,229
and it really wasn't

2222
05:11:49,229 --> 05:11:51,599
what I wanted

2223
05:11:51,599 --> 05:11:53,599
Diablo 3 was fun

2224
05:11:53,599 --> 05:11:56,029
but it was not the thing that I

2225
05:11:56,029 --> 05:12:03,139
wanted at what cost

2226
05:12:03,139 --> 05:12:05,139
they made it they tried

2227
05:12:05,139 --> 05:12:07,139
to do the whole money auction house thing and

2228
05:12:07,139 --> 05:12:09,139
you could look over that for a little while but

2229
05:12:09,139 --> 05:12:11,380
items didn't drop the problem with

2230
05:12:11,380 --> 05:12:13,380
D3 the very beginning of the game the game was like

2231
05:12:13,380 --> 05:12:15,619
a month old

2232
05:12:15,619 --> 05:12:17,619
the unique the legendaries the unique items

2233
05:12:17,619 --> 05:12:20,369
that's what we call them

2234
05:12:20,369 --> 05:12:22,369
they didn't drop and they were just random

2235
05:12:22,369 --> 05:12:24,369
stats and shit it was just

2236
05:12:24,369 --> 05:12:26,369
dog shit it was dog shit

2237
05:12:26,369 --> 05:12:31,099
Reaper's Souls came out and

2238
05:12:31,099 --> 05:12:33,099
they actually did a lot of good

2239
05:12:33,099 --> 05:12:35,099
they fixed a lot of stuff

2240
05:12:35,099 --> 05:12:37,099
what's the

2241
05:12:37,099 --> 05:12:39,099
the lead dev of

2242
05:12:39,099 --> 05:12:41,099
Reaper's Souls

2243
05:12:41,099 --> 05:12:43,919
he tried to do his best

2244
05:12:43,919 --> 05:12:45,919
and I don't think that guy works for the company anymore

2245
05:12:45,919 --> 05:12:47,919
he like fixed Reaper

2246
05:12:47,919 --> 05:12:49,919
he fixed Diablo 3

2247
05:12:49,919 --> 05:12:51,919
and I think they got rid

2248
05:12:51,919 --> 05:12:55,569
of him did that happen am I remembering

2249
05:12:55,569 --> 05:13:01,580
this correctly yeah he left

2250
05:13:01,580 --> 05:13:10,700
yes why

2251
05:13:10,700 --> 05:13:12,700
why wouldn't you make sure that

2252
05:13:12,700 --> 05:13:15,459
that person was

2253
05:13:15,459 --> 05:13:17,459
responsible for your next Diablo

2254
05:13:17,459 --> 05:13:20,020
iteration that's

2255
05:13:20,020 --> 05:13:22,020
it's like almost

2256
05:13:22,020 --> 05:13:24,020
he

2257
05:13:24,020 --> 05:13:26,639
yeah

2258
05:13:26,639 --> 05:13:28,639
his name is Josh Martens

2259
05:13:28,639 --> 05:13:33,360
this dude and

2260
05:13:33,360 --> 05:13:35,360
obviously some of the other talented people that worked with him

2261
05:13:35,360 --> 05:13:37,360
and underneath him right

2262
05:13:37,360 --> 05:13:39,360
but this dude at all these

2263
05:13:39,360 --> 05:13:41,360
they took that game and they made it

2264
05:13:41,360 --> 05:13:46,099
actually like fun

2265
05:13:46,099 --> 05:13:48,099
alright well you want to do

2266
05:13:48,099 --> 05:13:50,659
Diablo 4 it'd be great

2267
05:13:50,659 --> 05:13:52,659
if you did it because from the ground up

2268
05:13:52,659 --> 05:13:54,659
you probably would have some better ideas

2269
05:13:54,659 --> 05:14:01,250
like what the fuck happened

2270
05:14:01,250 --> 05:14:06,240
like what

2271
05:14:06,240 --> 05:14:08,240
if they okay if Blizzard announces

2272
05:14:08,240 --> 05:14:10,240
forget about like all the other

2273
05:14:10,240 --> 05:14:12,240
controversy that Blizzard is seeing

2274
05:14:12,240 --> 05:14:14,240
right now if Diablo 4 is announced

2275
05:14:14,240 --> 05:14:16,240
I don't what the fuck is this game even going to be

2276
05:14:16,240 --> 05:14:26,349
who even made this game

2277
05:14:26,349 --> 05:14:28,349
Josh Mascara not

2278
05:14:28,349 --> 05:14:30,349
Martens okay yeah I want to make sure I get that right

2279
05:14:30,349 --> 05:14:36,619
Josh Mascara and Kevin Martens

2280
05:14:36,619 --> 05:14:38,619
were the directors of Reaper's Souls

2281
05:14:38,619 --> 05:14:41,569
and after everybody said

2282
05:14:41,569 --> 05:14:43,569
all the critics all the fans

2283
05:14:43,569 --> 05:14:45,569
were like wow

2284
05:14:45,569 --> 05:14:47,569
I mean Diablo 3 still isn't that

2285
05:14:47,569 --> 05:14:49,569
good it's still like not what I wanted

2286
05:14:49,569 --> 05:14:51,569
but this is actually

2287
05:14:51,569 --> 05:14:53,569
really good they like took what they

2288
05:14:53,569 --> 05:14:55,569
took all the broken systems

2289
05:14:55,569 --> 05:14:57,569
and they made them all work and then they made the game

2290
05:14:57,569 --> 05:15:04,159
fun you don't have

2291
05:15:04,159 --> 05:15:06,159
those people stick around

2292
05:15:06,159 --> 05:15:12,500
it's like it's just counter

2293
05:15:12,500 --> 05:15:25,740
productive I bought D3

2294
05:15:25,740 --> 05:15:27,740
on release and regret it deeply all my friends accounts

2295
05:15:27,740 --> 05:15:29,740
got stolen within the first oh jeez

2296
05:15:29,740 --> 05:15:35,819
that's not good

2297
05:15:35,819 --> 05:15:37,819
he like Diablo

2298
05:15:37,819 --> 05:15:39,819
me click on enemy push number

2299
05:15:39,819 --> 05:15:41,819
keys once every hour

2300
05:15:41,819 --> 05:15:45,340
right but you're

2301
05:15:45,340 --> 05:15:47,340
that you're referencing Diablo

2302
05:15:47,340 --> 05:15:49,520
3 Diablo 2

2303
05:15:49,520 --> 05:15:51,520
was a dangerous fucking game if you

2304
05:15:51,520 --> 05:15:53,520
okay look there's let me be

2305
05:15:53,520 --> 05:15:56,080
if you played Diablo 2

2306
05:15:56,080 --> 05:15:58,080
and you did like the exploity kind of

2307
05:15:58,080 --> 05:16:00,080
ways to just mow through everything

2308
05:16:00,080 --> 05:16:02,080
once you play on like when you get to Nightmare in Hell

2309
05:16:02,080 --> 05:16:04,080
in Diablo 2 it was a dangerous game

2310
05:16:04,080 --> 05:16:10,860
you were at

2311
05:16:10,860 --> 05:16:13,169
risk of dying in every

2312
05:16:13,169 --> 05:16:15,169
room in Diablo 2

2313
05:16:15,169 --> 05:16:17,169
especially when you got past like level 20

2314
05:16:17,169 --> 05:16:22,659
Diablo 3

2315
05:16:22,659 --> 05:16:24,659
was just a nut it

2316
05:16:24,659 --> 05:16:27,150
was an idle game

2317
05:16:27,150 --> 05:16:29,150
at it's very very core once you got

2318
05:16:29,150 --> 05:16:31,150
once it got to complete late game it was an idle game

2319
05:16:31,150 --> 05:16:34,220
and you just waited

2320
05:16:34,220 --> 05:16:36,590
until this thing

2321
05:16:36,590 --> 05:16:38,590
dropped letters on the ground

2322
05:16:38,590 --> 05:16:40,590
that you walked over and did you get

2323
05:16:40,590 --> 05:16:42,590
just open it

2324
05:16:42,590 --> 05:16:44,590
and what is it okay no it's not better than what I have

2325
05:16:44,590 --> 05:16:46,590
we're gonna just watch the numbers again

2326
05:16:46,590 --> 05:16:55,099
the ever changing difficulty slider in

2327
05:16:55,099 --> 05:16:57,099
Diablo 3 was a bad idea bad design

2328
05:16:57,099 --> 05:17:01,970
maybe but

2329
05:17:01,970 --> 05:17:03,970
I think there's probably ways to do

2330
05:17:03,970 --> 05:17:07,939
that there's ways to do like

2331
05:17:07,939 --> 05:17:09,939
a never ending difficulty slider

2332
05:17:09,939 --> 05:17:12,369
without it being

2333
05:17:12,369 --> 05:17:14,610
well I mean never ending is the wrong

2334
05:17:14,610 --> 05:17:16,610
word there really should only be like

2335
05:17:16,610 --> 05:17:19,869
five difficulties

2336
05:17:19,869 --> 05:17:21,869
the regular game cause there was like even

2337
05:17:21,869 --> 05:17:24,180
you would put that slider

2338
05:17:24,180 --> 05:17:26,180
on hard

2339
05:17:26,180 --> 05:17:28,180
or very hard and it was just

2340
05:17:28,180 --> 05:17:30,669
the normal game the issue

2341
05:17:30,669 --> 05:17:32,669
with Diablo 3 in the end

2342
05:17:32,669 --> 05:17:34,669
was the normal game

2343
05:17:34,669 --> 05:17:36,669
was absolutely

2344
05:17:36,669 --> 05:17:38,669
just brainless

2345
05:17:38,669 --> 05:17:40,669
you couldn't even

2346
05:17:40,669 --> 05:17:43,169
lose you could just walk into

2347
05:17:43,169 --> 05:17:45,169
rooms and things it wasn't even hard

2348
05:17:45,169 --> 05:17:47,169
the game was not even it was so easy

2349
05:17:47,169 --> 05:17:50,689
so on it's lowest kind of end

2350
05:17:50,689 --> 05:17:52,689
like the first three difficulties were just

2351
05:17:52,689 --> 05:17:54,689
why would you even do them there's too easy

2352
05:17:54,689 --> 05:17:56,689
and the last three difficulties

2353
05:17:56,689 --> 05:17:58,689
were not even possible

2354
05:17:58,689 --> 05:18:01,950
it's just such a

2355
05:18:01,950 --> 05:18:04,450
scale was just off have

2356
05:18:04,450 --> 05:18:06,450
a normal base game that's challenging and fun

2357
05:18:06,450 --> 05:18:08,450
have a difficulty after that

2358
05:18:08,450 --> 05:18:10,819
that's harder have a difficulty

2359
05:18:10,819 --> 05:18:12,819
after that that's really fucking hard

2360
05:18:12,819 --> 05:18:14,819
like a normal nightmare

2361
05:18:14,819 --> 05:18:16,819
hell you want to have inferno

2362
05:18:16,819 --> 05:18:18,819
have it be sure have

2363
05:18:18,819 --> 05:18:20,819
inferno have inferno be stupid

2364
05:18:20,819 --> 05:18:23,700
and like impossible

2365
05:18:23,700 --> 05:18:25,700
but that's like the plus that's like the

2366
05:18:25,700 --> 05:18:27,700
game plus mode

2367
05:18:27,700 --> 05:18:33,500
you don't have to do that there's like

2368
05:18:33,500 --> 05:18:35,500
how many there were like twelve difficulties

2369
05:18:35,500 --> 05:18:44,590
in Diablo 3

2370
05:18:44,590 --> 05:18:47,919
there's a lot fifteen

2371
05:18:47,919 --> 05:18:53,680
that's even more than I thought

2372
05:18:53,680 --> 05:18:56,750
there are nineteen now

2373
05:18:56,750 --> 05:18:58,750
why even have difficulties then

2374
05:18:58,750 --> 05:19:00,750
why not just have prestige

2375
05:19:00,750 --> 05:19:03,250
what's the point of having

2376
05:19:03,250 --> 05:19:05,250
difficulties why don't you just prestige

2377
05:19:05,250 --> 05:19:07,250
give up all your shit and then start at level one

2378
05:19:07,250 --> 05:19:09,250
and the game's harder

2379
05:19:09,250 --> 05:19:20,450
what's the point of having a slider

2380
05:19:20,450 --> 05:19:22,450
and if you don't want to prestige you just don't

2381
05:19:22,450 --> 05:19:25,970
just uncheck a box

2382
05:19:25,970 --> 05:19:27,970
that's what seasons is

2383
05:19:27,970 --> 05:19:29,970
seasons doesn't change the difficulty

2384
05:19:29,970 --> 05:19:32,909
seasons is just the

2385
05:19:32,909 --> 05:19:35,599
that's not a difficulty thing right

2386
05:19:35,599 --> 05:19:37,599
should you play Diablo 2 it really depends

2387
05:19:37,599 --> 05:19:41,180
because Diablo 2

2388
05:19:41,180 --> 05:19:43,810
is old and a lot of

2389
05:19:43,810 --> 05:19:45,810
people can't get over that

2390
05:19:45,810 --> 05:19:47,810
old school video game feel

2391
05:19:47,810 --> 05:19:50,500
there's a lot of things in Diablo 2

2392
05:19:50,500 --> 05:19:52,500
that are stupid

2393
05:19:52,500 --> 05:19:54,500
that really suck that you have to get over

2394
05:19:54,500 --> 05:19:58,720
it's just an old old

2395
05:19:58,720 --> 05:20:00,720
game that never got

2396
05:20:00,720 --> 05:20:02,959
the remaster treatment

2397
05:20:02,959 --> 05:20:04,959
never got the remake treatment

2398
05:20:04,959 --> 05:20:06,959
it's just an old ass game that's really really good

2399
05:20:06,959 --> 05:20:09,779
stupid

2400
05:20:09,779 --> 05:20:11,779
equals bad

2401
05:20:11,779 --> 05:20:21,119
greater than bad yeah

2402
05:20:21,119 --> 05:20:23,119
you gonna play the weird minecraft Diablo clone

2403
05:20:23,119 --> 05:20:25,119
I don't know

2404
05:20:25,119 --> 05:20:28,509
it depends on if it's any good

2405
05:20:28,509 --> 05:20:30,509
but we went from scream fortress

2406
05:20:30,509 --> 05:20:32,509
to talk about I don't know Diablo somehow

2407
05:20:32,509 --> 05:20:34,819
yeah the whole Diablo thing

2408
05:20:34,819 --> 05:20:37,060
really it's

2409
05:20:37,060 --> 05:20:39,060
that's close to my chest cause

2410
05:20:39,060 --> 05:20:41,549
it's literally one of my favorite

2411
05:20:41,549 --> 05:20:45,139
things ever and that's why

2412
05:20:45,139 --> 05:20:47,139
stuff like Diablo immortal Diablo

2413
05:20:47,139 --> 05:20:49,569
4 I

2414
05:20:49,569 --> 05:20:51,569
can't I'm not gonna get excited for those games

2415
05:20:51,569 --> 05:20:53,869
and there's no I don't

2416
05:20:53,869 --> 05:20:57,009
have a reason to because

2417
05:20:57,009 --> 05:20:59,009
everybody that ever was really involved in

2418
05:20:59,009 --> 05:21:01,009
any of the original stuff just didn't there anymore

2419
05:21:01,009 --> 05:21:03,380
it's like they have all these

2420
05:21:03,380 --> 05:21:05,380
assets randomly that have been canned over

2421
05:21:05,380 --> 05:21:08,060
the years who knows

2422
05:21:08,060 --> 05:21:10,060
like the Diablo 4 might have

2423
05:21:10,060 --> 05:21:12,060
Titan assets

2424
05:21:12,060 --> 05:21:15,520
remember that that a lot of that turned

2425
05:21:15,520 --> 05:21:26,209
into Overwatch who knows

2426
05:21:26,209 --> 05:21:28,209
there's not a good demand for those games anymore

2427
05:21:28,209 --> 05:21:31,020
and that's another thing too yeah

2428
05:21:31,020 --> 05:21:33,020
people just top

2429
05:21:33,020 --> 05:21:35,259
down ARPGs

2430
05:21:35,259 --> 05:21:37,259
at least in the realm of like Diablo and like

2431
05:21:37,259 --> 05:21:39,259
loot collecting and stuff people would rather

2432
05:21:39,259 --> 05:21:41,259
loot collection is still very much alive

2433
05:21:41,259 --> 05:21:43,259
but people would rather

2434
05:21:43,259 --> 05:21:45,259
get their loot from

2435
05:21:45,259 --> 05:21:47,259
first person shooters or out of a box

2436
05:21:47,259 --> 05:21:51,490
they took

2437
05:21:51,490 --> 05:21:53,490
that Diablo formula

2438
05:21:53,490 --> 05:21:55,490
was transformed into a box you

2439
05:21:55,490 --> 05:22:09,950
pay two dollars for

2440
05:22:09,950 --> 05:22:11,950
Path of Exile you hit enemies with a rubber sword

2441
05:22:11,950 --> 05:22:13,950
yeah Path of Exile is awesome

2442
05:22:13,950 --> 05:22:16,189
I just don't like the camera

2443
05:22:16,189 --> 05:22:18,880
it's something that's it's kind of

2444
05:22:18,880 --> 05:22:31,549
hard for me to get over

2445
05:22:31,549 --> 05:22:33,549
uncensored what's the name what

2446
05:22:33,549 --> 05:22:38,159
that's an interesting problem what's the problem with

2447
05:22:38,159 --> 05:22:40,590
the camera it's I

2448
05:22:40,590 --> 05:22:42,590
think it's it's too close

2449
05:22:42,590 --> 05:22:47,330
I wish I could pull the camera

2450
05:22:47,330 --> 05:22:49,330
out like 20%

2451
05:22:49,330 --> 05:22:51,330
more in Path of Exile

2452
05:22:51,330 --> 05:22:53,330
and I wish it

2453
05:22:53,330 --> 05:22:55,500
was angled a

2454
05:22:55,500 --> 05:22:57,500
little bit more

2455
05:22:57,500 --> 05:22:59,500
like a few like five degrees

2456
05:22:59,500 --> 05:23:01,500
ten degrees more than it is right now

2457
05:23:01,500 --> 05:23:11,099
but that's the only reason why

2458
05:23:11,099 --> 05:23:13,470
and that's a very

2459
05:23:13,470 --> 05:23:15,470
very very just personal thing

2460
05:23:15,470 --> 05:23:17,470
as to why I can't play it

2461
05:23:17,470 --> 05:23:20,990
there are actually some

2462
05:23:20,990 --> 05:23:22,990
I think you can get mods for it or you can

2463
05:23:22,990 --> 05:23:24,990
get like window changers for

2464
05:23:24,990 --> 05:23:26,990
it but it's really not the same

2465
05:23:26,990 --> 05:23:28,990
if you run Path of Exile

2466
05:23:28,990 --> 05:23:30,990
in a window and you resize the window in really

2467
05:23:30,990 --> 05:23:32,990
strange ways you can kind of get more

2468
05:23:32,990 --> 05:23:34,990
viewing angle and but

2469
05:23:34,990 --> 05:23:37,229
it's not

2470
05:23:37,229 --> 05:23:48,689
ideal and I know that

2471
05:23:48,689 --> 05:23:50,689
problem that's not a problem

2472
05:23:50,689 --> 05:23:52,689
that anybody really

2473
05:23:52,689 --> 05:23:54,689
that's not an

2474
05:23:54,689 --> 05:23:56,689
issue to patch the game over

2475
05:23:56,689 --> 05:23:58,860
when a

2476
05:23:58,860 --> 05:24:00,860
handful of people just don't really like the camera

2477
05:24:00,860 --> 05:24:03,229
right like every

2478
05:24:03,229 --> 05:24:05,229
there are millions of people that have

2479
05:24:05,229 --> 05:24:07,229
played Path of Exile and loved every second of it

2480
05:24:07,229 --> 05:24:09,229
that don't care that doesn't bother them at all

2481
05:24:09,229 --> 05:24:11,229
so I really I do not

2482
05:24:11,229 --> 05:24:13,229
I never expected nor do I ever

2483
05:24:13,229 --> 05:24:15,229
expect them to be like oh like one guy

2484
05:24:15,229 --> 05:24:17,229
said he didn't like the camera so let's

2485
05:24:17,229 --> 05:24:19,229
spend a bunch of development

2486
05:24:19,229 --> 05:24:21,229
time making it so you can pull the camera out

2487
05:24:21,229 --> 05:24:23,229
by 20%

2488
05:24:23,229 --> 05:24:25,470
no I completely understand

2489
05:24:25,470 --> 05:24:32,369
but yeah

2490
05:24:32,369 --> 05:24:36,459
we can move on. Goad conversation

2491
05:24:36,459 --> 05:24:39,470
all interesting stuff

2492
05:24:39,470 --> 05:24:46,189
ACDC freak thanks

2493
05:24:46,189 --> 05:24:48,189

2494
05:24:48,189 --> 05:24:50,189
money on you than my Tinder profile

2506
05:25:25,069 --> 05:25:27,069
how have I never played their original

2507
05:25:27,069 --> 05:25:29,069
FPS franchise

2508
05:25:36,860 --> 05:25:38,860
I'm gonna be in bed

2509
05:25:38,860 --> 05:25:40,860
Kim is gonna think I'm insane

2510
05:25:40,860 --> 05:25:42,860
I'm gonna be in bed lying there

2511
05:25:42,860 --> 05:25:44,860
just on my iPad just hanging out

2512
05:25:44,860 --> 05:25:46,860
after eating some dinner

2513
05:25:46,860 --> 05:25:48,860
and I was gonna think of oh shit

2514
05:25:48,860 --> 05:25:50,860
and it's gonna make me

2515
05:25:50,860 --> 05:25:52,860
laugh and there's gonna be no context

2516
05:25:52,860 --> 05:25:59,709
but thank you ACDC freak

2517
05:25:59,709 --> 05:26:01,709
thank you for giving

2518
05:26:01,709 --> 05:26:03,709
me ten dollars instead

2519
05:26:03,709 --> 05:26:05,709
of Tinder I guess

2520
05:26:05,709 --> 05:26:10,319
thank you also thank you

2521
05:26:10,319 --> 05:26:12,319
to Freudian Weapon for the 250 happy Wednesday

2522
05:26:12,319 --> 05:26:14,500
hope you feel better

2523
05:26:14,500 --> 05:26:16,500
try not to overdo it on another note

2524
05:26:16,500 --> 05:26:18,500
do you plan on dressing up for Halloween this year

2525
05:26:18,500 --> 05:26:20,500
I plan on

2526
05:26:20,500 --> 05:26:22,500
being in some sort of costume on stream

2527
05:26:22,500 --> 05:26:24,500
we'll see what it is I have not figured

2528
05:26:24,500 --> 05:26:30,189
it out yet but yeah I

2529
05:26:30,189 --> 05:26:32,189
am I'm not overdoing it I mean

2530
05:26:32,189 --> 05:26:34,189
this stream is only about I mean we've spent

2531
05:26:34,189 --> 05:26:36,189
a little bit more extra time here because we're getting into

2532
05:26:36,189 --> 05:26:38,189
some conversations but

2533
05:26:38,189 --> 05:26:40,189
I stopped at about five hours

2534
05:26:40,189 --> 05:26:42,189
four hours and like 45 minutes that's probably what it'll

2535
05:26:42,189 --> 05:26:44,189
be like tomorrow somewhere around like four

2536
05:26:44,189 --> 05:26:46,189
four four and a half five

2537
05:26:46,189 --> 05:26:49,970
I'm trying just to

2538
05:26:49,970 --> 05:26:51,970
be easy but

2539
05:26:51,970 --> 05:26:53,970
over the in the long term

2540
05:26:53,970 --> 05:26:55,970
it won't be less time on stream

2541
05:26:55,970 --> 05:26:57,970
it'll just be spread over more days

2542
05:26:57,970 --> 05:26:59,970
so that'll be should be fine

2543
05:26:59,970 --> 05:27:04,830
but thank you I appreciate the concern

2544
05:27:04,830 --> 05:27:07,259
Siroc thanks for the 250

2545
05:27:07,259 --> 05:27:09,259
they say B E E T

2546
05:27:09,259 --> 05:27:11,259
L E J U I

2547
05:27:11,259 --> 05:27:13,259
I S E C E

2548
05:27:13,259 --> 05:27:16,080
I can't say that a third time

2549
05:27:16,080 --> 05:27:18,080
or I will get sucked into into hell

2550
05:27:18,080 --> 05:27:22,159
thank you thank you the thrill

2551
05:27:22,159 --> 05:27:24,159
for the 500 bits I remember playing

2552
05:27:24,159 --> 05:27:26,159
this game years ago and my god the sounds

2553
05:27:26,159 --> 05:27:28,159
and ragdoll physics is still insanely funny

2554
05:27:28,159 --> 05:27:30,159
the game in series really does hold

2555
05:27:30,159 --> 05:27:32,159
up well today which is pretty cool

2556
05:27:32,159 --> 05:27:34,159
hope your poops aren't spooky

2557
05:27:34,159 --> 05:27:38,639
yeah it does

2558
05:27:38,639 --> 05:27:40,639
I'm surprised this game is this

2559
05:27:40,639 --> 05:27:43,009
old when games are this old

2560
05:27:43,009 --> 05:27:45,380
they are not that good

2561
05:27:45,380 --> 05:27:47,380
they might be funny but they're not

2562
05:27:47,380 --> 05:27:49,380
fun to play this game is actually fun

2563
05:27:49,380 --> 05:27:56,029
to play too

2564
05:27:56,029 --> 05:27:58,029
the rest of the franchise is really not that good

2565
05:27:58,029 --> 05:28:00,029
yeah maybe I'll do

2566
05:28:00,029 --> 05:28:02,029
them eventually I know that I just wanted to do this

2567
05:28:02,029 --> 05:28:04,029
one because I just heard

2568
05:28:04,029 --> 05:28:06,029
so many good things about it and I never put any

2569
05:28:06,029 --> 05:28:08,590
time into it but here we are

2570
05:28:08,590 --> 05:28:12,819
no uh Freudian thanks for the 250

2571
05:28:12,819 --> 05:28:14,819
my last bit message got messed up tried

2572
05:28:14,819 --> 05:28:16,819
to put a germa heart emote so have

2573
05:28:16,819 --> 05:28:21,470
another thank you

2574
05:28:21,470 --> 05:28:23,470
uh Jason thanks for the 250 what was your

2575
05:28:23,470 --> 05:28:25,470
most embarrassing moment on stream

2576
05:28:25,470 --> 05:28:27,900
uh pick one of these two either

2577
05:28:27,900 --> 05:28:29,900
slapping myself in the face or

2578
05:28:29,900 --> 05:28:31,900
crying to a

2579
05:28:31,900 --> 05:28:33,900
farting and screaming

2580
05:28:33,900 --> 05:28:36,909
compilation both pretty

2581
05:28:36,909 --> 05:28:38,909
embarrassing I'm not sure

2582
05:28:38,909 --> 05:28:45,310
which one is worse one of those

2583
05:28:45,310 --> 05:28:49,409
uh thank you

2584
05:28:49,409 --> 05:28:51,409
Zeon WASD for the 500

2585
05:28:51,409 --> 05:28:55,060
bits bro where the

2586
05:28:55,060 --> 05:28:57,060
literal teeny parts of the universe

2587
05:28:57,060 --> 05:28:59,060
who invented the idea of things

2588
05:28:59,060 --> 05:29:01,060
meaning things so

2589
05:29:01,060 --> 05:29:03,060
things just mean whatever they

2590
05:29:03,060 --> 05:29:05,060
we say they do where are the

2591
05:29:05,060 --> 05:29:07,060
arbiters also I'm sorry for

2592
05:29:07,060 --> 05:29:09,060
saying fuck you that one time

2593
05:29:09,060 --> 05:29:11,060
so Resident Evil 2 Claire

2594
05:29:11,060 --> 05:29:13,060
campaign fuck you

2595
05:29:13,060 --> 05:29:19,200
that's what I'm saying yeah that's

2596
05:29:19,200 --> 05:29:21,200
what I said I said like we have made

2597
05:29:21,200 --> 05:29:23,200
up that idea of giving things

2598
05:29:23,200 --> 05:29:25,200
meaning by things that we say

2599
05:29:25,200 --> 05:29:30,580
but hey I appreciate the fuck you

2600
05:29:30,580 --> 05:29:36,209
thank you Gondrelaine thanks for the

2601
05:29:36,209 --> 05:29:38,209
250 since it's been a while since you did some DOS

2602
05:29:38,209 --> 05:29:40,209
the archive just added over 2500

2603
05:29:40,209 --> 05:29:42,209
hundred new DOS games

2604
05:29:42,209 --> 05:29:44,770
I did see that

2605
05:29:44,770 --> 05:29:46,770
that seems insane I know you stop

2606
05:29:46,770 --> 05:29:48,770
the streams because you were digging too deep into the vault

2607
05:29:48,770 --> 05:29:50,770
and the games were getting worse

2608
05:29:50,770 --> 05:29:52,770
but the new games should add new stuff

2609
05:29:52,770 --> 05:29:55,139
or a new stream also a good

2610
05:29:55,139 --> 05:29:57,139
idea would be a horror DOS game stream if you want

2611
05:29:57,139 --> 05:30:00,020
I love you Jerma

2612
05:30:00,020 --> 05:30:02,020
more DOS games playable yeah we'll go back to it

2613
05:30:02,020 --> 05:30:04,900
we'll check them out see if there's any

2614
05:30:04,900 --> 05:30:13,090
better ones any new good ones that's

2615
05:30:13,090 --> 05:30:15,520
the thing when you have a list of

2616
05:30:15,520 --> 05:30:17,520
like 5000 games that are on a

2617
05:30:17,520 --> 05:30:19,819
page you just go wow

2618
05:30:19,819 --> 05:30:21,819
how are we going to do this

2619
05:30:21,819 --> 05:30:24,509
how are we going to do this reliably

2620
05:30:24,509 --> 05:30:29,250
but those streams some of the most fun

2621
05:30:29,250 --> 05:30:31,250
I've had on stream this last year has been

2622
05:30:31,250 --> 05:30:33,250
on some of those DOS streams

2623
05:30:33,250 --> 05:30:35,250
so I definitely would like to do it again

2624
05:30:35,250 --> 05:30:37,250
but I want it to be the whole stream

2625
05:30:37,250 --> 05:30:39,939
because it seems like it's kind of in one of those scenarios

2626
05:30:39,939 --> 05:30:41,939
where it's oh we're going to do

2627
05:30:41,939 --> 05:30:43,939
this and that's going to be like four or five hours

2628
05:30:43,939 --> 05:30:45,939
and I guess we'll do DOS too but you would really

2629
05:30:45,939 --> 05:30:47,939
you have to focus a full

2630
05:30:47,939 --> 05:30:50,240
day on that

2631
05:30:50,240 --> 05:30:52,240
you need to give some of those games the

2632
05:30:52,240 --> 05:30:54,240
hour or two plus that they deserve

2633
05:30:54,240 --> 05:30:56,990
at least some of them

2634
05:30:56,990 --> 05:31:01,470
so yeah I agree we should go back and do it

2635
05:31:01,470 --> 05:31:04,159
thank you Jason

05:31:04,159 --> 05:31:06,159

05:34:10,939 --> 05:34:12,939
Jerma also wondered what kind of retro

2679
05:34:12,939 --> 05:34:14,939
or obscure computers you are a fan of

2680
05:34:14,939 --> 05:34:16,939
keep up the cool projects and streams

05:34:16,939 --> 05:34:19,759
as always thank you

2682
05:34:19,759 --> 05:34:21,759
what kind of retro or obscure

2683
05:34:21,759 --> 05:34:23,759
computers are you a fan of I am actually

2684
05:34:23,759 --> 05:34:25,759
a big fan of those

2685
05:34:25,759 --> 05:34:27,759
old

2686
05:34:27,759 --> 05:34:30,580
chunky IMAX

2687
05:34:30,580 --> 05:34:32,580
do you remember those things that were in the computer lab

2688
05:34:32,580 --> 05:34:34,580
they were different colors

2689
05:34:34,580 --> 05:34:41,099
they were red, blue,

2690
05:34:41,099 --> 05:34:44,240
green, orange

2691
05:34:44,240 --> 05:34:46,240
they were junk but I loved them

2692
05:34:46,240 --> 05:34:49,119
they were cool

2693
05:34:49,119 --> 05:34:51,299
it was just this

2694
05:34:51,299 --> 05:34:53,299
little shell that had everything

2695
05:34:53,299 --> 05:34:55,299
right there it was a little computer

2696
05:34:55,299 --> 05:34:57,299
this is insane

2697
05:34:57,299 --> 05:34:59,299
I remember what that room smells like

2698
05:34:59,299 --> 05:35:01,299
I remember what that computer smells like

2699
05:35:01,299 --> 05:35:03,790
that room had that IMAX

2700
05:35:03,790 --> 05:35:05,790
smell there was an IMAX room

2701
05:35:05,790 --> 05:35:08,220
smell it was

2702
05:35:08,220 --> 05:35:10,220
it was the computer smell the computer

2703
05:35:10,220 --> 05:35:19,630
lab smell so every time I

2704
05:35:19,630 --> 05:35:21,630
think of an IMAX

2705
05:35:21,630 --> 05:35:23,630
I smell the computer lab

2706
05:35:23,630 --> 05:35:32,529
I can never explain what

2707
05:35:32,529 --> 05:35:34,529
that smell is I just know that

2708
05:35:34,529 --> 05:35:40,740
it exists it was great

2709
05:35:40,740 --> 05:35:45,150
but let's get the credits on

2710
05:35:45,150 --> 05:35:51,860
throw them up there

2711
05:35:51,860 --> 05:35:54,419
get this

2712
05:35:54,419 --> 05:35:56,419

2713
05:35:56,419 --> 05:36:00,830
why did you get rid of this

2714
05:36:00,830 --> 05:36:03,840
streamlabs OBS

2726
05:36:47,549 --> 05:36:49,549
I'm about to end the stream

2727
05:36:49,549 --> 05:36:51,549
we'll be back tomorrow though at the same time

2728
05:36:51,549 --> 05:36:54,299

05:36:54,299 --> 05:36:57,889
thank you everybody

2730
05:36:57,889 --> 05:36:59,889
thanks for supporting the stream continuing to sub

2731
05:36:59,889 --> 05:37:01,889
new subs old subs

2732
05:37:01,889 --> 05:37:04,259
you surprise me every day

2733
05:37:04,259 --> 05:37:09,380
thank you we have a few more to get through

2734
05:37:09,380 --> 05:37:11,380
in the bits category here

2735
05:37:11,380 --> 05:37:14,580
modus pons

2736
05:37:14,580 --> 05:37:16,580
says there better be bugleberry on Halloween

2737
05:37:16,580 --> 05:37:18,580
don't give in to the haters

2738
05:37:18,580 --> 05:37:20,580
thanks for the 250

2739
05:37:20,580 --> 05:37:22,880
what makes you think I'm gonna give in to

2740
05:37:22,880 --> 05:37:24,880
people that hate that character

2741
05:37:24,880 --> 05:37:26,880
don't you think that's more of a reason why they would show up

2742
05:37:26,880 --> 05:37:35,069
I'm just saying if they were too

2743
05:37:35,069 --> 05:37:38,779
I'm not gonna say anything

2744
05:37:38,779 --> 05:37:40,779
I don't I mean I don't know what his schedule

2745
05:37:40,779 --> 05:37:42,779
is like it's he's all over the place

2746
05:37:42,779 --> 05:37:55,139
thank you zion

2747
05:37:55,139 --> 05:37:57,139
WASD for the 500 bits

2748
05:37:57,139 --> 05:37:59,139
I'm actually sorry for saying fuck you though

2749
05:37:59,139 --> 05:38:01,139
I don't know how to express love dog

2750
05:38:01,139 --> 05:38:03,139
real question

2751
05:38:03,139 --> 05:38:05,139
are you ever gonna do stand up comedy on stage

2752
05:38:05,139 --> 05:38:07,139
and in person you're more funny while improvising

2753
05:38:07,139 --> 05:38:09,139
like most netflix comedians are with their super

2754
05:38:09,139 --> 05:38:11,139
well prepared specials

2755
05:38:11,139 --> 05:38:13,139
and your premeditated skits are even funnier

2756
05:38:13,139 --> 05:38:15,139
also any plans on voice acting

2757
05:38:15,139 --> 05:38:17,139
and anything you got some cords

2758
05:38:17,139 --> 05:38:20,909
uh no

2759
05:38:20,909 --> 05:38:23,340
I don't think I'll ever do it

2760
05:38:23,340 --> 05:38:26,029
unless it was for a specific

2761
05:38:26,029 --> 05:38:28,029
stream

2762
05:38:28,029 --> 05:38:30,029
where the point was I was gonna try

2763
05:38:30,029 --> 05:38:32,029
to do open mic night

2764
05:38:32,029 --> 05:38:34,029
I thought about that before

2765
05:38:34,029 --> 05:38:36,029
where I try to come up with

2766
05:38:36,029 --> 05:38:38,029
some material

2767
05:38:38,029 --> 05:38:40,029
to do a seven minute set

2768
05:38:40,029 --> 05:38:42,029
in open mic night

2769
05:38:42,029 --> 05:38:44,340
but that's the thing every time

2770
05:38:44,340 --> 05:38:46,340
I've come into this oh

2771
05:38:46,340 --> 05:38:48,340
should I do that would be fun I think that might be funny

2772
05:38:48,340 --> 05:38:50,340
I always hit the same wall

2773
05:38:50,340 --> 05:38:52,580
that's a ten minute

2774
05:38:52,580 --> 05:38:55,900
stream

2775
05:38:55,900 --> 05:38:57,900
that's it

2776
05:38:57,900 --> 05:39:05,650
there's nothing else there

2777
05:39:05,650 --> 05:39:07,650
I mean maybe if I want to do it one day and just turn it on

2778
05:39:07,650 --> 05:39:09,650
and just who cares I'm gonna do like a

2779
05:39:09,650 --> 05:39:14,319
fourteen minute stream

2780
05:39:14,319 --> 05:39:16,319
we'll see but I don't have really any plans

2781
05:39:16,319 --> 05:39:18,319
for it there are plans for other streams

2782
05:39:18,319 --> 05:39:20,319
coming up over the next few months

2783
05:39:20,319 --> 05:39:22,319
but that is not currently one of them

2784
05:39:22,319 --> 05:39:27,700
but thank you so much

2785
05:39:27,700 --> 05:39:31,729
I like what's going on here

2786
05:39:31,729 --> 05:39:34,540
you know this is where my focus is

2787
05:39:34,540 --> 05:39:37,939
completely so I don't think I could

2788
05:39:37,939 --> 05:39:39,939
I couldn't spread myself out if I really

2789
05:39:39,939 --> 05:39:41,939
wanted to like pursue a stand up comedy career

2790
05:39:41,939 --> 05:39:44,180
that's time that's a lot

2791
05:39:44,180 --> 05:39:46,180
of dedication it's a lot of work

2792
05:39:46,180 --> 05:39:48,180
I wouldn't want to split myself

2793
05:39:48,180 --> 05:39:52,779
up it takes a lot

2794
05:39:52,779 --> 05:39:56,689
to do that

2795
05:39:56,689 --> 05:39:58,689
thanks for the 250 thanks for playing fear Jerma

2796
05:39:58,689 --> 05:40:00,689
my big brother bought this game

2797
05:40:00,689 --> 05:40:02,689
and I was too young in a wuss to play

2798
05:40:02,689 --> 05:40:04,689

as I say a lot

2817
05:40:51,900 --> 05:40:54,459
but I have to stay interested

2818
05:40:54,459 --> 05:40:56,459
or else I can't do this

2819
05:40:56,459 --> 05:41:00,750
if I am not interested if I'm

2820
05:41:00,750 --> 05:41:02,750
not having a good time and I'm not

2821
05:41:02,750 --> 05:41:04,750

2822
05:41:04,750 --> 05:41:06,750

or may not happen in my life

2887
05:44:26,369 --> 05:44:29,759
that I have to start to think about

2888
05:44:29,759 --> 05:44:31,759
you know there's a lot of things to think about

2889
05:44:31,759 --> 05:44:41,869
as you get a little older

2890
05:44:41,869 --> 05:44:51,409

I am getting a little older

2899
05:45:09,490 --> 05:45:11,490
and you need to start you gotta think about what you

2900
05:45:11,490 --> 05:45:13,860
do when you get a little older

2901
05:45:13,860 --> 05:45:15,860

2921
05:46:26,270 --> 05:46:28,270

2926
05:46:38,220 --> 05:46:40,400
