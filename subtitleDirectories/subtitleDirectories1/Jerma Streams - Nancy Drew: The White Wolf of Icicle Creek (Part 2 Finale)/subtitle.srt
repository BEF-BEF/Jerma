00:00:00,120 --> 00:01:17,269
Hello, how are you? How is everybody doing today? Today I think I'm going to be

2
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:37,239
playing some Nancy Drew and also Diablo 4. How you doing good? Starting off strong

3
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:41,420
on this one. Starting off strong. No, I'm gonna slow it down a little bit today.

4
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:56,319
There was a TikTok voiceover. No, go full speed. How many stream points do I have?

5
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:07,569
Stream points? Like channel points on my own channel? Do I even get them? Introducing

6
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,210
channel points. Watch German 985 earn channel points. Unlock rewards. I haven't

7
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,490
even clicked the button to begin accruing points. So I guess the answer is

8
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:33,560
zero. Wouldn't I be... Oh yeah, me getting my own currency created

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,830
from my own channel from me? I feel like that's contributing to... I don't... No, I

10
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,550
don't want to do that. I would want to make sure... I would want to take away

11
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:53,759
from myself from having that many points. Fake fan. Some kind of currency thing.

12
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:00,500
Dude, just click it. I don't want to click get it get started. I don't want...

13
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,539
When I click... If you click get started that just to me tells the computer like

14
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:10,819
alright I'm ready to do this now and I don't even want to do it. You know what I mean?

15
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,500
I don't want to click get started because I want to finish it the second

16
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:27,740
I click get started. Like the title? I mean it's true. Scared of commitment. I'm

17
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,099
scared of committing to things that I don't necessarily really care that much

18
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:39,340
about. I understand. I said steam points. God damn it. Why does this happen to me

19
00:03:39,340 --> 00:04:03,330
every day? Your balance on steam. I don't know. I don't... I don't know. 200. There you go.

20
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:26,769
This is my balance. 200. A lot. 200 points. That's a shitload. No, not your steam wallet

21
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:37,410
balance. That's not accurate. I'm just made up a number. I feel like that that would be kind of

22
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,189
a lot of money to have in a steam wallet. Wouldn't it? Like 200 plus dollars? Maybe not. It's

23
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:55,779
depending on how many games you plan on buying. But anyways let's talk about what's happening.

24
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:03,980
Okay. Let's talk. Today we're going to be finishing our Nancy Drew homework.

25
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,379
I feel like the Diablo 4 server is... I played it... I have to confess. I played it a lot last night.

26
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,610
Ollie and I played it a lot. I made another character and I just kind of... kind of went...

27
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:36,899
we kind of went nuts without us. Yeah. I did. I did. But I can tell you that

28
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:51,649
I enjoy it. I think it's fun to play. And I'm hoping that the game is searching to how to stay

29
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:57,009
fair. It's searching. They're trying to come up with a way to say be fair about it but also not

30
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,250
too involved. Don't let them think that you care that much. That's what's screaming through my

31
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:09,730
brain right now. So what I want to tell you is I want to play as the Necromancer. That'll be the

32
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:24,829
way that I really tell if I'm going to play it or not. But I do like... I like it so far. I don't

33
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:29,069
know how deep the skill system is really going to go. I don't know how deep the itemization is going

34
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:45,220
to be. But if Necromancer is fun, I will probably be playing it. That's it. That's it. But today is

35
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,939
the last day that it can be played for this week. So the plan is to do Nancy Drew for a little while.

36
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,339
Maybe get to the end of that. Maybe get however far enough the end of there that I want to,

37
00:06:54,339 --> 00:07:02,160
you know, play it. And then move on to D4 for the rest of the night. Just chill because I think it's

38
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:11,740
turning off at midnight. Is it tomorrow at midnight or is it tonight at midnight? Because I still want

39
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:21,170
to play with these sorcerers. 3 p.m. on Monday Eastern. Okay. So there's plenty of time. And then

40
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:30,110
Resident Evil 4, I'm going to play it essentially until I beat it. So that's, I believe... Is that

41
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:36,110
the 23rd at midnight or is that the 24th in the middle of the day? I asked this in pre-stream. I'm

42
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,509
curious if anybody knows. Is the Resident Evil 4 remake coming out like in the middle of the day

43
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,649
on the 24th or is it going to be like a midnight release on Thursday? I don't think anybody really

44
00:07:45,649 --> 00:08:03,420
knows. He didn't even listen to our answer. It's just out when it's out. Yeah. Well, whatever.

45
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,160
Whatever it launches on the 24th, that is when I will be getting ready to play it. Apparently,

46
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,319
the remake, as of all the reviews I've seen, is stellar. It is getting unbelievable reviews.

47
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:25,310
Some of these outlets are giving it a 10. This is getting tens. So I don't want to say that,

48
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,000
like, okay. Am I? I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it. I gave the Resident Evil 2 remake

49
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,679
game of the year when it came out. Is that going to happen again for another Resident Evil remake?

50
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:46,259
It might. We'll see. That's funny, though. Oh, Bat Chest stellar reviews.

51
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,899
All right. I am going to open up Nancy Drew. I might not put the camera on. I've been doing

52
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,480
no cam and I've been liking it. We'll see. Maybe we'll turn it on a little bit later.

53
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:21,340
We'll go cam camless for now. Don't worry about cam. Yeah, no, I know. I know nobody here is

54
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,940
pressured me to put it on. Don't worry. Just last night was kind of like I was feeling it.

55
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,220
Let's put it on and just fuck around. It's going to happen a lot. All right. Nancy Drew.

56
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,240
Does anyone remember anything that we did? I'll be really honest with you. Not last night. You know,

57
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,100
my sense of time is so fucked up. We were going back and forth between Nancy Drew and Diablo that

58
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,610
I kind of don't even remember what the hell we even did. Hey, I tried to do the cat puke noise

59
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,129
and it just makes me sound like I'm burping. Any tips? I do not recommend anybody attempt that.

60
00:09:54,129 --> 00:10:02,049
Don't try that at home. You should not. Don't try this at home. Okay. I need to make I need to put

61
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:06,929
like a huge disclaimer up somewhere on the stream that just don't ever try anything or say anything

62
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,690
I say ever. Don't ever do any of this and don't watch and don't comment. Don't subscribe. Don't

63
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,090
be here. I should probably put that up, right? Don't ever say anything that I say. Don't ever

64
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,730
do anything that I've done. Don't ever attempt anything I've done. Don't ever watch. Don't

65
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,809
subscribe. Don't donate or anything. You know what I mean? Just probably like a disclaimer.

66
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,279
That would be such a fucked up disclaimer. All right. Don't watch. Just put it at the bottom

67
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:40,750
of the screen. Hold on. I got to think of like a huge paragraph though. I should have thought

68
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:47,330
about this like an hour ago. No, I'll do it another day. All right. Nancy Drew, what do you got?

69
00:10:47,330 --> 00:11:00,059
Hopefully it's not too loud. How's the audios? All right. Don't attempt anything you see. Yeah,

70
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,480
but people that are coming in and seeing that pinned are going to think I'm about to like

71
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,720
backflip off of a building or something, right? Like that that you get that warning before

72
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,879
something crazy is about to happen and they're going to be really disappointed when it's just

73
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:20,340
Nancy Drew. I'm not going to do anything. That's a warning to me. To me that is something dangerous

74
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,779
is going to happen at some point. He's going to turn his cam on. He's going to get like attacked

75
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:37,279
by a bear or something. All right. Anyways, what I need to focus. We fished. We put the line in.

76
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:44,220
We did the fishing mini game. I couldn't keep one, right? I snagged a log. There goes my line.

77
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:53,090
Can you stop being funny for a minute? I need to pee. Um, well, I think funny is very subjective

78
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,730
to people. So you, you might've thought that was really funny would just happen, but somebody else

79
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,330
might not think that what I just did was funny. And you two need to come to some common ground

80
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,899
of what you think is funny with for me because, um, it's very subjective. So I think you could

81
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:16,259
have made a lot of people very upset with what you just said. I need a container for the fish.

82
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:29,440
It's a comedy committee. All right. So I got it. What the hell have we been doing?

83
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,450
All right. What the hell happened? The wolf, right? I remember the wolf. I remember this guy,

84
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:43,070
the avalanche. We reported the avalanche. I remember that we had, we cooked dinner. We cooked

85
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:53,440
lunch for people. I did. I have access to the snowmobile. So I got to track down the snowmobile.

86
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:03,679
This is Nancy Drew guys. Beyond centrist Andy. Really cold. How do you go? Wait, wait,

87
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:11,460
beyond centrist Andy. What? Wait a minute. That's not correct. Wouldn't beyond centrist Andy be

88
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,580
like not in the middle. That would be beyond the middle. So I can't be,

89
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,970
I can't go too far centrist because that means I've got, I have to go somewhere.

90
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:31,279
If I don't get warm soon, she's going to die. She's going to die. Why is she, what's happening?

91
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,320
Turn around, turn around, turn around. Where am I going? Turn around, turn around. Nancy,

92
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:46,100
turn around. I used to go lake. No, this way. I'm walking wicked stiff too. All right. There's

93
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:54,909
this snowmobile. Let me go inside and warm up for a second. Warm again. This is an unhinged

94
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:06,269
stream incoming. No, it's not. No, it's on the Z axis. You're still a centrist. Z axis.

95
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:38,639
What? I want to go. What? Okay. It's 7 a.m. Hold on a minute. Sure. Am I being put into time out?

96
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:47,250
Is this time out? Get in there and, and, and stay, stay there for a while. What? Wait,

97
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,889
what are we eating? French toast. I didn't tell me how to make French toast. I thought I only

98
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:59,360
know how to make hamburgers. How do you make French toast? I didn't get a tutorial. Oh, hold on.

99
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,860
Yes, may order French toast. You hear the cook. Are you just waiting for breakfast? What is French

100
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,460
toast? I don't know how to make this. What is this? Where's this? Where's the step by step

101
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:18,049
instruction? I would just drink an orange juice and walk out. I would take the, the yogurt in the

102
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:25,980
sitting in the ice, which always freaks me out. But, you know, whatever. Like I know that when

103
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,059
the yogurt sitting in the ice, I kind of feel like I want that in a, I don't, I want it in the fridge

104
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:35,250
because it's like yogurt. I don't want it left out because what if like the top part's getting cold?

105
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,210
I mean, the bottom part's getting freezing cold. The top part might be at like room temp. I don't

106
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,789
know. Anyway, somebody is asking, do you know how to make French toast without the book? Let me,

107
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:54,289
let me see if I get it right. Okay. It's two pieces of bread and you dunk the bread in egg,

108
00:15:54,289 --> 00:16:03,899
in an egg wash. And then after you soak the bread in an egg wash, you put it on like a pan

109
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,740
and you kind of cook it. And then you put, I don't know, like cinnamon sugar on it. I don't eat French

110
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,860
toast. I don't really like French toast. Why would I know how to make this? Why would I care

111
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:23,419
about making the food that I don't eat? I don't eat French toast. Why do I care? I'm not a sugary

112
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:32,820
breakfast guy. I'm a savory breakfast guy. Eggs, corned beef hash, bacon, sausage, toast, orange

113
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,700
juice, a shitload, a huge, like a 32 ounce glass of orange juice. I'm talking like a fucking thermos

114
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,179
that you would take if you were going hiking for like three days. That amount of orange juice.

115
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:52,240
All right. What do they want? Okay. French toast and Canadian bacon should be cooked on the griddle.

116
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,559
Omelette should be in the frying pan. Make sure all food is thoroughly cooked before removing it

117
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,799
from the griddle or pan. French toast and omelette should be golden brown while Canadian bacon should

118
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:06,400
be lightly browned. Making an omelette, simply add any old, any, when making an omelette, simply add

119
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,180
any extra ingredients to the pan of egg mixture. Fold the omelette over, whatever. Okay. I'm just

120
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:20,619
going to, they're going to get what they get. How many pieces of French toast? It's two, right?

121
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:29,170
Is it done? How do I pick this up?

122
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,769
Fanning through the book with a piece in my hand. Oh, that's not it. How do I put this down?

123
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:53,900
What? Okay. Honestly, how do I put it down? One French toast. I put this ingredient down.

124
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:12,059
Okay. There's French toast. Beautiful. Three Canadian bacon. Okay. I flip it.

125
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:31,420
Do I, why is this not cooking? Is the oven on? Oh, okay. Three, one omelette and then you want

126
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,019
spinach, two bacon, one bacon, two spinach and two green peppers. All right. Omelette. Where's the egg?

127
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:55,140
Okay. And then what? What do you want? Fuck. This is wrong. Three. Okay. One bacon, two spinach,

128
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:07,200
two green peppers. What is this bacon? One bacon, two, what is this spinach? One bacon, two spinach,

129
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:30,130
two green peppers. Okay. Hey, come on. We're hungry here. I'm going. I'm working. Okay.

130
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,299
Order up. Order up. Three French toast, two Canadian bacon. That's all you want.

131
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:52,539
Imagine waiting hours for French toast. Imagine forcing somebody that doesn't know anything about

132
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:57,980
how to cook meals from more than one or two people at a time and not being a chef. I'm a fucking

133
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:02,779
detective at a detective agency telling that person that they need to be the chef

134
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:07,259
for an expensive lodge. Order up. I can tell you one thing that that would be pretty dumb.

135
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:16,299
Are we sure that it's, am I, am I wrong here? Okay. Two French toast, one omelette. Let's get

136
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:23,410
the French toast on there. And what do you want in it? Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives.

137
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:29,819
Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives. Spinach, green, three olives. I don't remember.

138
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:39,710
One spinach, one cheese, three green peppers. Ah, what? Oh my God. I'm fucking so mad right now.

139
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,720
You don't bring me here. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. What if, you know what?

140
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:57,809
Who cares? Does it matter? I don't know who cares. Just French toast. Just eat it.

141
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:09,859
One French toast. Everybody wants French. Just make, I don't care if it sits here. I need one

142
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:20,420
French toast, two, three, four, five, six, seven French toast. So one, just fill the whole thing

143
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:28,529
because it's going here. You wanted one. You wanted one. You wanted one. You wanted two.

144
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:39,069
You wanted, ah. Oh my God. This is embarrassing. This is embarrassment. I fucking didn't get it.

145
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:42,509
All right. I, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be in the kitchen. I don't want to be

146
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,779
in the kitchen. I don't want to fucking be here. I would never do this and I would never do it.

147
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:58,769
Nancy, you need to cook for like 10 people. Good. Hire a chef. Thank you. One, one, two.

148
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:15,309
Oh my God. If I just press a goddamn button. All right. Two, three, four, five, six, seven pieces.

149
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:38,299
Okay. So it's two and then three. And then it's two. Single task Andy. I don't want to mess it up.

150
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,859
This game, guys, this game came out when some of you guys weren't even born yet.

151
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:51,599
All right. Give me, give me a minute. All right. Three Canadian bacon or five, six, seven. All

152
00:22:51,599 --> 00:23:12,259
right. So let's do three. And then, okay, three. Okay. So this three here, why does this take so

153
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:20,180
much longer than anything else? But I feel like this would be the fastest thing to go. Okay.

154
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:41,329
Then two Canadian bacon, five, six, seven. This is two, three. How many people here weren't born in

155
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:50,450
2007? Is that when this game came out? I apparently have a lot of 10 year olds here. I didn't think

156
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,730
about that. How many does it want? Three? Stop making me laugh. You're fucking me up.

157
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:19,009
This whole channel is 10 year olds. All right. Two more. Dude, 2007 was 28 years ago. Aware.

158
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:34,259
All right. Now we do the complicated shit with the omelets. One omelet. So this person wants a

159
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:40,500
fully, this one person wants a fully loaded omelet. One bacon, three spinach, three cheese.

160
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,299
I would put the cheese first. In my opinion, the greens and vegetables is after. This is throwing

161
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:59,809
me off. One bacon, three cheese. One bacon. One, two, three. Three spinach, three peppers, one olive.

162
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:16,059
Here you go. What the hell do you want? One bacon, one spinach. What the hell else do you want? Two

163
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:33,230
green, one olive. Order up. All right. That's all you wanted, right? Omelets kind of suck. Yeah.

164
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,460
Actually, I'm not a big fan of omelets either. To me, omelets almost feel like they're too much.

165
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,339
Order up. I don't know why. Sounds like we've eaten a whole omelet. Just kind of like,

166
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:53,220
I can't, I can't really do it. All right. Two bacon, two spinach, one green. Two bacon, two spinach,

167
00:25:53,940 --> 00:26:01,299
one green. What else do you want? Two olives. What do you want in here? No omelet. Okay.

168
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:11,170
So you're done. Order up. So you want three spinach, one cheese, two green, three spinach,

169
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:26,960
two, wait, two green, one cheese, two olives. Wait, which one is this one? I forget.

170
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,609
Which one is the, who got, who got this one? Who got this one? This is this person's, right?

171
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:58,690
Order up. Okay. Good. And then no omelet for you? Order up. We got it. We did it. Finally. Cheese.

172
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:11,420
Okay. So I think we're all right. I think we did a pretty good job. We're good. So now what

173
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:33,279
were we doing? Oh, the snowmobile. Let's get the hell out of here. Move. Can't you, how am I driving

174
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:56,509
this on this? Doesn't it have to be in snow? What is going on? Oh no, Nancy's dead. Wait, how?

175
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:34,210
Oh. Have I fired? Oh no. Okay. Well, now we know what happens when you just hold the

176
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:45,359
pedal down to the floor. Honestly, to crash that many times as violently as I, Jesus Christ,

177
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,940
to crash that violently, I feel like the car needs to be made out of magnets or something.

178
00:28:49,940 --> 00:29:18,910
And it just pulled me around. Um, what is the hit box? What are you in there? Oh, okay. I think I

179
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:33,059
made it. The sign's not buried. So I guess there hasn't been an avalanche. Okay. How do I put the

180
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:52,609
key down? No, I want to put the key away. Why can I spell avalanche right now? Okay. I'm not looking

181
00:29:52,609 --> 00:30:07,089
at chat. Avalanche. A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E. Avalanche. Correct? I didn't look at chat. I promise. So

182
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:30,160
maybe I can't, I guess I can't do anything here. It just seems any secrets are up and up here.

183
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:37,119
You should do a spelling bee. You know, a streamer spelling bee. Like, yeah, that would actually be

184
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:43,009
pretty funny and just pick wicked, easy fucking words. I guarantee you we would eliminate half

185
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:47,539
the people. I, cause you know why I know that? Cause I know I would be eliminated by spelling

186
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:52,660
like a simple five-letter, four-letter word, like five-letter word. I don't think you even

187
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,779
need to go up to like seven or eight letters. I think everyone would get eliminated after like

188
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:05,839
the fifth. So what, what, what did I do wrong? Is arrow pointing me back to the lodge?

189
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:22,799
Like where is this moment to go? I need shoes. Oh, I probably do need snow shoes. That's all right.

190
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:51,359
In the play testing for this game, people probably got lost. I probably need snow shoes. Okay. So

191
00:31:51,359 --> 00:32:09,920
then now what's, what's the progress then? What's the progress? Much better. I was really cold.

192
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:17,140
Tell the guy there was an avalanche. I did. Oh, I was checking to see if there was an avalanche.

193
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,460
And now we have to tell the person downstairs, whoever that was, that there was not an avalanche.

194
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,460
Now I remember. Sorry guys. I was playing like Diablo four every 30 minutes. I don't even

195
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:34,500
remember what happened in Diablo four. And I played it again too. It was pretty cool though.

196
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:54,380
All right. Where is this dude in here? Where the hell are you? Hey, I did.

197
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:03,740
No avalanche. There's your snowmobile key. You make a report to the eye cup. Um, I see, uh,

198
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,869
and then after the, after that, I think there's a, um, I think after there's a U and then after

199
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:16,269
that, there's what, uh, A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P the 16th letter of the alphabet, which is

200
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:24,130
P. I think that's how it's spelled. I think I got it. Wait, what? Oh, what do you got to tell me?

201
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:34,910
What did you tell me to spell? I forgot. That's okay. I'll call him. What else do you want?

202
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:42,849
Oh, I'll call them. Okay. I'll get out of your hair now. Good. What? What you need. That's all

203
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:49,019
the questions I had. Should I call? I probably should call anyways. I think it's just call

204
00:33:49,019 --> 00:34:24,530
anyways, right? I want to go this way. Well, that kind of blew it all up to me. Now what do I do?

205
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:34,190
It's not the snowmobile. It's not the avalanche thing. So now what? We've been here. We've been

206
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,190
here. We've been here. We've been here. We did this. Wait. Yeah. We know we did. Maybe we'd know

207
00:34:40,190 --> 00:35:03,489
we didn't do this. Did we go look in people's rooms again? Okay. I guess. Okay. What's the area

208
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:09,469
code though? Cause I want to call that. Why would it want this number here? If it wasn't supposed

209
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:23,460
to call it five, five, five, it's four Oh three. Was it four Oh three five, five, five, two eight.

210
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,050
What was it? Two eight, two eight. Hurry up. I, it's going to go dial tone on me. Two eight,

211
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:45,949
two eight, two eight, two eight, two eight, two eight, two nine, three eight. Oops. Your call

212
00:35:45,949 --> 00:36:13,329
cannot be completed. Four oh three, five, five, five, two nine, eight, three, two, three, eight, three.

213
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:33,840
This is going to, is anyone going to pick up? Well, I mean, I'm just going to, what are these?

214
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:57,340
What's the maximum amount of rings? Oh, so what's that ring? Two, three, eight, three. It was wrong.

215
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:35,949
Two, three, eight, three, two, three, eight, three. What? Uh, what about three 12? Oh yeah.

216
00:37:35,949 --> 00:38:10,769
God damn it. It was the first one. No, I want one. Okay. So we'll just say,

217
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:29,920
called, called Joe. There's no Joe. Joe mama. Ban everybody writing that. I want every,

218
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,340
every single person writing that right now. I want them banned from the channel and I want them

219
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:40,559
permanently five minute banned. And what that means is that you do not get unbanned within that

220
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,099
five minutes. So like, it's really funny until you get permanently banned for five minutes.

221
00:38:46,099 --> 00:39:04,380
I don't know what the hell to do. There's the laundry bag again. I guess I'll just take it.

222
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:24,590
I need like phone numbers on here. All right. So I'm just going to go, but I need to find,

223
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:33,860
this is a granny like, although not really granny like means that I'm being pursued in

224
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:55,519
this house while I have to do all these things. Yeah. This, this predates a granny likes the bed

225
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,809
used towels clean no later than noon. Okay. I already, nobody's even using their room.

226
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:20,349
Is there nothing in here? There has to be something in here, right? This one has been locked.

227
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:30,099
I can't get even, I can't even get into this one. Who's in here? It's vacant. Oh, that's why.

228
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:39,500
But yeah, it's because it's vacant. Well, that's great. All right. Well, well,

229
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,500
let me see if anybody else has anything I have to do. I got to do everybody's bed.

230
00:40:45,500 --> 00:41:05,969
All right. Fine, fine, fine, fine. There you go. Okay. There's four rooms that need it today.

231
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:27,280
What's this? Oh, interesting. This room is studying wolves. Hmm. Why, why do you have

232
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:43,329
this book? Okay. And you're a sculptor. Interesting. Who's in this room? I can ask

233
00:41:43,329 --> 00:42:05,119
a few questions about that. I think who is in this room? Okay. This is who the hell's in here.

234
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:18,909
Oh, Lou. Okay. Lou Talbot, Lou Talbot. Interesting. Okay. Did they make this? Is this a children's

235
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:23,309
game? This is the person that had the wolf book in their room. The one to be like, you are like,

236
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:29,869
you like wolves. Yes, I do. And you did it. Yes, I did. Is that like the smoking gun in a way?

237
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:50,019
I have to imagine in my feed. Okay. Give me your laundry. Nice. I can't get into anybody else's

238
00:42:50,019 --> 00:43:16,320
closets unless, wait. You forgot to put all the laundry in that bag. No, I got it all actually.

239
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:35,579
Are there people down here now hanging out that I can talk to? I'm just going to call Lou on the

240
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:46,289
phone. Nancy. Hey, got a proposition for you. Since Lou hears two chicken to go mano a mano

241
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:52,210
with me out there in the ice fishing shack. Snowshoeing is my thing, dude. Besides, it's

242
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:59,699
animal cruelty. Oh, you're Lou. Give me a break. You ever been ice fishing? I have. As a matter of

243
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:06,099
fact, I have. Excellent. Here's the deal. I need some competition. So I want you to go out there

244
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,099
and try to catch a bigger fish than I caught yesterday, which means you got to catch a two

245
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:14,820
foot northern pike. Now it's a bit of a hike out to the lake, but the shack is solar heated.

246
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,699
I already did this even from first. So what do you say, kiddo? You game? Anything to make

247
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:27,489
your guests happy. Atta girl. Well, I'll let you get back to beating Lou. Do I need a place to

248
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:35,219
keep it or no? What's up? So you go to school and talk to me here? Yep. University of California,

249
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:43,630
Brea. What degree are you working on? Master of fine arts. Hmm. What's your favorite medium?

250
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,829
Cool. So what's your favorite medium? Holograms. What is this? Like the Spanish Inquisition.

251
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:56,590
Hey, give her a break. She's just trying to make pleasant conversation. Oh, right. Um,

252
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:06,610
my favorite medium, dirt. Dirt. You paint with dirt? I create works of art by manipulating

253
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:11,570
naturally occurring geophysical substances like dirt. Oh, sometimes I just use my hands,

254
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,809
but most of the time heavy machineries. So you're blowing up pieces of the earth.

255
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:19,170
No, what do you understand? You're like throwing grenade. You're like burying grenades and like

256
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:27,380
taking great to be misunderstood. FYI, Ralph Waldo Emerson said that. Yeah. Yeah. You're like

257
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:33,599
using explosives to create art in like out in the wilderness or something, right? I think that

258
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:43,250
might be what it is. Is this your first time at the lodge? Yep. My car broke down on my way to

259
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,889
Lake Louise last summer, pulled in here to wait for the tow truck and figured it'd be a cool place

260
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:57,920
to visit during the winter. So here I am. Well, good luck. Well, let's go catch the fish. At least

261
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,750
that's the way we know we have to do. I can't wait to have to play somebody in this because

262
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:10,300
you know, I'm going to have to and I don't want to. No need to go in there till it's time to cook.

263
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:18,769
I already went over this, but this is from the oldest RPGs. Like D&D taught us this like almost

264
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:25,579
a hundred years ago. People are good at stuff. The whole the whole reason for like a party system

265
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,460
is because everybody's good at different things. I don't want to be the chef. I don't want to be

266
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:36,380
the manager. I don't want to be the performer at the fucking comedy club that's down the street.

267
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:44,750
We all do the things that we're good at. That's why if RPGs have taught us anything. All right,

268
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:58,079
how do I get back to the lake? Is it this way? Call the avalanche patrol? Uh, I was going to,

269
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:05,469
but that guy said he was going to do it anyways. You are literally a performer at a comedy club.

270
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:13,659
You don't see me cooking, do you? You don't see my like unbelievable chef skills. No, you don't. You

271
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:22,260
don't see me. Um, you know, I'm not, I can't, I can't really let him cook. Let him cook. No,

272
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:39,489
you don't really want me to. What about the egg salad? Well, the egg salad only requires a very

273
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:48,210
small amount of cooking. Go back to chicken ridge and risk getting caught in another avalanche.

274
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:53,010
I don't think so. All right. I, I need a map. Go back to chicken ridge and risk getting caught

275
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:59,900
in another avalanche. I don't think so. I'm not going out there again. I figured if I spun her

276
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:04,690
around a few times, she wouldn't know where she was either. It's like, I'm not going back there.

277
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,650
Oh yeah. Actually, you know what? You've spun me around enough times. That actually seems pretty

278
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:20,539
safe. Let's go that way. No more avalanches for me. Thank you very much. What was that lake? I feel

279
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:29,599
like I got lost accidentally and found my way to that lake. You were literally on a cooking stream.

280
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:44,829
Yes. Yes, I was. Would you have eaten any of the food that Charlie and I made? Okay. So what,

281
00:48:44,829 --> 00:49:02,239
what's the point there? Aren't you making the point for me? I need to look at a map because

282
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,239
this is, Oh, here it is. I got it. Too cold to go any further. Oh, come on. All right. I got it.

283
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:17,679
It's the skating pond. It's the skating pond. Is it get in the house? Oh my God. I just clicked off

284
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:41,360
of it. Much better. Okay. It's really cold. Go right back out here. Is it the skating pond

285
00:49:41,360 --> 00:50:03,280
past the skating pond? Save the game. It was, wasn't it? I don't remember. No, it's not. It was

286
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:20,349
like a weird, it was like a shack. And I remember being like, how did I even get here? It's past

287
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:34,750
the snowball fight area. It's not that way. Which way? I better not follow this trail until I know

288
00:50:34,750 --> 00:51:10,500
for sure where it goes. Nobody remember over here. Oh, Oh, nice hit. Nice job. Oh, look out. Oh,

289
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,920
it got me. You let me bite. Now let me bite. Now get out of the way. I'll get out of the way. Get

290
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:33,409
out of the way. Thank you. It was fun. Very fun time. If I don't get warm soon, I may not make it.

291
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:41,260
All right. Well, hurry up. Okay. Catch the fish. It looks like someone came in here and just

292
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:46,539
wrecked everything, including the fishing gear. What? So much for catching a two foot northern

293
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:51,739
pike. It's definitely one of the two of them then. I can't fish. The tackles ruined. There's

294
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:57,739
somebody one step ahead of me. It's one of those two. Left behind by whoever trashed this place.

295
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:33,010
Birds of the Southwest. Okay. All right. Calling that. Get me out of here. Uninstall Diablo four,

296
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:56,500
please. I'm starting to get really cold. Why? It's Lou. It's definitely Lou. Somebody left me a note.

297
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:08,780
A note. Nancy Drew. Hmm. I really like playing snowball fights with you, but I'm afraid you

298
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,809
won't want to play with me anymore. If you play with me and win, I'll give you my top secret way

299
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:18,369
I can... Oh, this is a little kid. Nevermind. I thought this was like a mastermind criminal or

300
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:24,179
something. I'll give you my top secret way I can stay out in the cold for so long. Wait, wait.

301
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:53,500
Ready. Secret. I better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes. Wait, where?

302
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:30,059
Dude, this voice. What did you just throw at me? I didn't even see it. What did I even get? What is

303
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:36,989
that? What the... No, I don't want to use it right now. What is that? I didn't want to even take that.

304
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:46,449
What drugs did I just take? What did I just take? Did I soft lock myself or something?

305
00:54:46,449 --> 00:55:11,860
Was it a hand warmer? Why did I use it? What just happened? All right. Let's make the call.

306
00:55:15,420 --> 00:56:43,039
202-555-7237. Damn it. Two... What is it? 202-555-202-7237. Interesting. So, hey. Lou? Where's Lou? Lou?

307
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:00,260
Who? Has he been here the whole time with you?

308
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:16,340
What? You're kidding. So my gear's ruined? Yep. Completely. So much for our little fishing contest.

309
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:23,539
Wait a minute. Ollie ice fishes. Go ask him for a hook and line and don't take no for an answer.

310
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:33,579
Oh, okay. I'll see you two later, okay? Where's Ollie? Who's Ollie? I don't know who that is.

311
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:40,320
I've just learned these two people's names into long term memory like five minutes ago. So,

312
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,119
actually, I don't even know who the person on the right is. I'll catch you later. In real.

313
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,039
If you told me, Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars right now, tell me this guy's full name.

314
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,559
I wouldn't be able to do it. I don't think I wouldn't be able to do it. Even if you said it,

315
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,730
I'll give you a million dollars. I have no... I don't know what his first name is. I have no idea.

316
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:15,219
I know this is Lou. It's time to serve lunch now. Not time for kitchen duty yet. Okay. So,

317
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:22,219
I need to go find Ollie. Who's Ollie? Is Ollie this person down here? It's two people down.

318
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:28,820
This is Ollie? I'm glad for the chance to talk once again. There is something I must explain.

319
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:36,289
Sure. There is? What I said before about wolves, it is because my grandmother was killed by wolves,

320
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:46,239
killed and devoured. Okay. Are you serious? Years ago, when my mother was a little girl,

321
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:51,119
her mother, my grandmother was on her way back from the village on her motor scooter,

322
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:56,480
which was and still is the only means of transportation most Fredonians can afford.

323
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:03,360
It was January and the sun had just set and it was dark, very cold. There were thousands of

324
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,599
wolves in the countryside that winter. At night, they would roam in huge hungry packs. My grandmother

325
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,880
was halfway home when she came upon a young man waving from the side of the road for her to stop.

326
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,000
Wait a minute. He too had been on a scooter, but his had broken down and wolves were gathering

327
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,719
all around him, preparing to attack. My grandmother, of course, stopped and he

328
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,199
leapt on behind her and they took off down the road with the wolves, dozens of them

329
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,960
chasing after them. But with two people riding it, her scooter was slow, much too slow and the

330
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,119
wolves soon caught up with them. When one of the wolves seized my grandmother's boot and its teeth

331
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:47,280
and started to pull, instead of helping her, the man pushed her off the bike. It instantly gained

332
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:56,130
speed and he got away. My grandmother, set upon by the wolves, did not. If she died, how do you know

333
00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:01,250
that's what happened? If she died, how do you know that's what happened? Tormented by guilt,

334
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:06,929
the young man eventually confessed. He went to prison for several years and the wolves were

335
01:00:06,929 --> 01:00:13,409
hunted year round until the countryside was rid of them. But the damage was done. I don't think

336
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:23,010
that's what happened. Yeah. You ever see Lou Talbot when you're out there training?

337
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:27,570
Ever see Lou Talbot when you're out there training? The college student?

338
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:35,219
Just yesterday I had to slow down to avoid colliding with him. It ruined my whole session.

339
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:38,659
Chantal would like to use your name and picture on her website when she gets it.

340
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:48,429
Would that be okay? I'm sorry, but no. Guilty. Oh, well, so much for that. I have disturbed you

341
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:58,739
long enough. Kavicinaya. We've got some more info. Why do I feel like this is in slow motion?

342
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:21,219
I'm hearing slow motion artifact sounds. Does it sound like that? What you need? Someone went

343
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,579
into the ice fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment. Someone went into the ice

344
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:29,940
fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment. Probably some animal loving eco

345
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:37,010
fanatic who figured it was time to save the fish. How am I going to catch it? Problem is,

346
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:43,010
Mr. Kessler still insists that I try to catch a two foot northern pike. Say no more. There's

347
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:49,889
my tackle box. Oh, yes. Yes. Me into competing with him, but I can't very well do that when

348
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:55,650
you've got my hook and line now, can I? No, I don't suppose you can. What else do you want?

349
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:01,090
That's it. That's all the questions I had. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the

350
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:06,210
rooms were cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. How is that even possible? I don't

351
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:12,780
even care. If that's not game breaking, game progress breaking, I'm not doing it ever again.

352
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:42,380
I don't care. Yeah. OK, come on, kid. I feel like this is Groundhog Day and I have to do this every

353
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:48,139
day. Eventually. See, I've gotten so good at this because this is like the 5000th time I've had to

354
01:02:48,139 --> 01:03:17,940
do this. I love this voice. I want to hear more of it. I like it. I like this voice. It's cute.

355
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:36,349
It's like imagine. It is really, really cold out here. It sounds like Cartman. All right,

356
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:52,960
let's do what we were supposed to do an hour ago. Close to two feet, right? It's Dark Souls 2.

357
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:07,980
It does it. You'll hear it again. Just you'll hear it. It goes. It goes done, done, done,

358
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:20,769
done, done, done. It does it for one. It's one part of the song. Not this part. Yes, it does.

359
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:56,260
Just wait. Never mind. It goes done, done, done. And then that's it. It does it for one part of the

360
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:07,840
song. I mean, I'm like I'm a I'm a plastic beach fan, so I guess I have one of my favorite albums.

361
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:18,860
Rats too small. Also, I vodka pineapple. It's super good. It's not a whole lot of

362
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:43,250
bullshit. Yeah, I don't, you know, that's what I drink. Oh, no, that one looks pretty good.

363
01:05:43,250 --> 01:06:08,750
Rats too small. That was that's it. Oh, come on. There was that won't do.

364
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:21,969
Shit. It's not. It's not that one. There we go. Yay. Northern Pike fishing for me.

365
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:31,280
Gameplay resident sleeper. Hold on a second. Somebody resident sleeper, Nancy Drew.

366
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:43,460
Wait a second here. OK. OK. All right.

367
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:04,690
What did he fucking throw at me? Oh, my gosh. Whoever threw that ice ball at me must have set

368
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:10,210
off an explosion that shattered the ice. Huh? My jacket's gone. No wonder I'm so cold.

369
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:27,780
What? You're the worst detective I've ever heard of. I need to make it to shore by jumping from

370
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:35,409
ice floe to ice floe and put on that coat. Wait, Nancy. Nancy, somebody. Oh, hold on.

371
01:07:37,340 --> 01:08:03,090
What the hell is happening here? How do I get over there? How do I how do I get over there?

372
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:29,279
What? I can't reach it. There's no I didn't know you could go diagonal.

373
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:44,689
Those weren't even touching. First of all, I don't know. Let's come. I need to talk about

374
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:51,899
this for a second. Nancy, if somebody throws a snowball at you and then the room you are in

375
01:08:51,899 --> 01:09:02,670
explodes, it wasn't a snowball. Like, oh, no, if somebody threw a snowball at me and something

376
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:31,260
blew up, I must have caused an explosion. I don't what how am I supposed to do this?

377
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:46,130
What are we trying to do here? That is what OK, I have to step on this one to be able to get up

378
01:09:46,130 --> 01:10:21,390
there. I understand how it works now. We just got to get over there quick. What's going on?

379
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:40,500
Come on, get up there. Spawn one up there. Is there a rhyme or reason to how this works?

380
01:10:40,500 --> 01:11:01,250
Because I stepped on that one last time and it spawned one up here. This is just RNG. OK,

381
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:52,689
so if I go diagonal, then it spawned that over there. What if I go diagonal again? I think the

382
01:11:52,930 --> 01:12:00,800
idea to make it so you fill in these so that it has nowhere else to go makes the next one

383
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:33,710
over appear or disappear. I think it's random. Is that one? OK, then OK. I can't use the heat

384
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:38,960
pack. It's almost there. All right, just make my way over there. Come on, go, go, go, go, go.

385
01:12:38,960 --> 01:13:16,380
Come on, do it already. I'd be freaking out if I were you, dude. I'm all right. I just don't.

386
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:21,970
Is there a pattern? It doesn't feel like there is. If I go down, what happens?

387
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:28,369
It takes that one down. I go up. It takes the one above me. If I go down, will it

388
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:38,770
reappear? No, it won't. So what if I go left? What if I go right? OK, left again. Up. OK,

389
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,739
all right. Wait, wait, wait. I think I'm starting to understand what's going on here. All right.

390
01:13:41,739 --> 01:14:13,170
All right. All right. OK, so what is making it? So why did that spawn down there is the opposite

391
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:22,619
side? I don't know. I diagonal down left middle. No, it's definitely not random. It's OK. Well,

392
01:14:22,619 --> 01:14:28,189
how do I know if it's going to move one or not? If I go down, it takes someone below

393
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:31,789
where I land. If I go up, it takes below. If I go left, it takes the next one to go right.

394
01:14:31,789 --> 01:15:17,409
Diagonal is nothing throwing me off. Is that it? Did I get it? I think that's it. Is that it?

395
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:26,750
Fuck you. The blocks of ice are laid out in a grid pattern with horizontal, vertical,

396
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:32,720
and diagonal rows. If Nancy moves along a horizontal row, then random ice flows in that

397
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:37,600
row will appear or disappear. She moves in a vertical, then it will be ice flows in the

398
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:49,180
column that appeared. The same applies. Is this pre-recorded? No, it's just because you know

399
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:58,579
what I was about to say to you. I stopped myself. I stopped myself from saying. Have you been on this

400
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:12,560
for an hour? No, I just don't. We're fine. All right. I am starting to understand. So I want to

401
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,010
go diagonal because I want it to hold on. I want to like fill in the next diagonal spot, right?

402
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:33,779
I go like that and it'll have to. Okay. Fill it in again. Do it again. Fill it in.

403
01:16:42,159 --> 01:17:15,789
It's just so cold. The ruin one lets you place one. Yeah. Got it. I don't know whose this is or

404
01:17:15,789 --> 01:17:19,729
why that wolf left it here, but at least now I won't freeze to death.

405
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:26,180
Whose jacket is this? I feel warmer already. There's a note in one of the pockets.

406
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:46,050
Swear word. Since I can't go back the way I came, maybe these tracks will lead me to shelter.

407
01:17:47,010 --> 01:18:04,590
Beautiful mountain range. Beautiful mountain range. Avalanche ridge. Not exactly reassuring.

408
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:09,260
At this point that I look up, I cup my hands to my mouth and I go

409
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,960
just fucking wait and see what happens. The snow's so deep. I'm sinking up to my knees.

410
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,460
If I want to follow those tracks, I'm going to need some snowshoes.

411
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,380
Oh, I know where to get those.

412
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:39,300
Reuse joke do better. There's like 10,000 people that weren't here when I did that like two years

413
01:18:39,300 --> 01:19:02,239
ago. Stop it. What's this place called? Avalanche ridge. All right. So I got to get the

414
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,760
snowshoes to go to Avalanche ridge.

415
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:27,600
What? No, get. Wait, eat the thing. Eat the hand warmers. I don't eat them, but

416
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:40,270
hypothermia claims Icicle Creek lodge employee. What? Avalanche ridge. Not exactly reassuring.

417
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:46,189
Ski tracks. Probably Yanni's. I bet if I follow them, I'll wind up back at the lodge.

418
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:53,550
I was right. Nobody's going to look out the window and see Nancy Drew is like blue

419
01:19:53,550 --> 01:20:02,640
with icicles all over her face and shit. So come on. Was nobody aware? If I don't get warm soon,

420
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:31,220
I may not make it. I feel warmer. Lunchtime. I got it. I got this. Don't worry. Oh, wait,

421
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:41,819
somebody's sleeping. Well, who are you? Well, keep it down. Somebody's sleeping over there.

422
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:50,180
Uh, I'm Elsa's replacement. Oh, the new maid. Thank goodness. I was wondering how much longer

423
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:58,000
the owner expected us to endure these conditions and still pay full price. I'm trying to learn

424
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,439
everyone's name. What's your name? My name is Guadalupe Comeo. My friends call me Lupe.

425
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:12,829
So I should call you Lupe. I hardly think so, dear. Yeah. I don't even know your name.

426
01:21:12,829 --> 01:21:19,390
My name's Nancy Drew. Wonderful. Now be a doll and clean my room first. It'll hardly take you

427
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:26,109
any time at all, especially compared to the other rooms. The other guests are all men, single men.

428
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:33,979
Well, I'm happy to report that I've already cleaned your room. Excellent. What are you doing? I hate

429
01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:41,420
to sound nosy, but what are you doing? Birds. I'm watching birds. That's what I am. You see a bird

430
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:47,659
watcher. Sometimes I go outside and watch and sometimes I stay inside. It all depends on what

431
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:54,220
the birds feel like doing and what I feel like doing. She fucked up the, she fucked up the

432
01:21:54,220 --> 01:22:06,189
shack. That was the bird newspaper with the number on it. There's a bird magazine. Hmm. So that's

433
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:11,550
what brought you to Icicle Creek Lodge, the birding? Absolutely. The place is a veritable

434
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:18,670
birding paradise, even in winter. In fact, in the short time I've been here, I've seen hawks,

435
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,550
eagles, orioles, cardinals, jays. I was just going to say, oh yeah, name three birds.

436
01:22:25,869 --> 01:22:30,880
I should have said it. I was holding it until the conversation was over. I was right about to say,

437
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,640
oh yeah, name three birds. That would have been really funny. I was holding it because I didn't

438
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:40,130
want to talk over the conversation. Well, okay. Well, you named three birds. There you go.

439
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:45,420
Have you met the other guests? I've bumped into them at one time or another. Yes, I don't spend

440
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:52,140
all my time in front of this window. That Yanni fellow, he's very talented, but extremely intense.

441
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:57,260
His whole life revolves around being the best in the world. As for the two who are always sitting

442
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:03,500
across the way playing that silly game, the older man, Bill Kessler, he's no deep thinker,

443
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,699
but he's nice enough. But the other one, that college student, talking to him is like trying

444
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:13,819
to converse with a giant turnip. You're hiding booze in there? You're hiding booze in there?

445
01:23:13,819 --> 01:23:19,409
I almost prefer talking to the handyman, almost. Okay. Anyone that intent on destroying something

446
01:23:19,409 --> 01:23:25,260
as glorious as that wolf is hardly worth talking to. I'm just gonna say it's a little quiet.

447
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:35,100
You can turn it up. Let me know if that's better. Have you seen the wolf? Have you ever seen the

448
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:41,180
wolf that's been hanging out around here? No, not that I'm looking for it. Of course, Yanni

449
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:47,869
occasionally skis by, and that dullard, the student, I see him snowshoeing occasionally,

450
01:23:47,869 --> 01:23:57,220
but I've yet to see the wolf. Have you seen it? No, you see, I have. Yeah, up close and personal,

451
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:01,380
as a matter of fact. How did it act? Was it aggressive? Did it look injured?

452
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:07,840
You seem to really want to know a lot about this wolf, even though you claim to not really care,

453
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:14,140
and you're hiding booze in those binoculars. I don't think I fucking don't know.

454
01:24:16,829 --> 01:24:22,350
Actually, I think it may have saved my life. Really? Of course, its behavior does suggest

455
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:28,510
that it's had contact with humans before. Have you told anyone else what you just told me?

456
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:36,659
No. Good. Don't. You see, I'd like to see this wolf for myself, and I don't want everyone else

457
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:40,500
going after it and scaring it away. Okay, I have to tell everybody. There's no telling what that

458
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:44,899
trigger-happy handyman might do. So it'll just be our little secret, all right?

459
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:52,029
No. No. No, because I'm not going to end up with a kitchen knife in my back in 10 minutes.

460
01:24:52,029 --> 01:24:56,350
I'm going to tell everybody. Do you want a book about birds of the southwest?

461
01:24:56,350 --> 01:25:05,329
I might. Why do you ask? Hmm. See, I just like, just totally just throw this whole thing under

462
01:25:05,329 --> 01:25:12,050
the bus and just be like, well, because I know what you're doing. I know everything. And I know

463
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:18,420
there's booze in there. Because I found a piece of a book cover in the fishing shack,

464
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,380
and since it was about birds, I wondered if it was yours.

465
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:29,020
No, it's not from any book I have. I've never been in the ice fishing shack, so how could it be?

466
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:34,460
Yeah, but it forgot the whole part where I walk up to the window, get out a cigarette, like,

467
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:42,880
start smoking the cigarette and telling her about the magazine that I found in the shack.

468
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,770
Well, there was a magazine in the shack that had a lot of things about birds in it, and

469
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:53,659
well, I mean, not too many people around these parts really love birds as much as some people

470
01:25:53,659 --> 01:26:00,210
I've talked to recently. Have a good afternoon. And I make loud fucking walking sounds. There's

471
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:08,319
like jingling on my person, you know what I mean? Just like, ching, ching, ching. I make noise

472
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:17,729
whenever I go anywhere. Good luck. Good luck with your birding. Au revoir.

473
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:25,500
Yeah, if I was a... Sorry, let me get my fucking 200-caliber sniper rifle I dropped on the ground.

474
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:28,779
I wonder what you're doing out here.

475
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,350
Okay, well then where did this just come from?

476
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:42,989
It was probably lying there on the floor all along and you just happened to kick it into view,

477
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:48,510
that's all. This did used to be a hunting lodge deer. I wouldn't worry about it.

478
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:53,979
Yeah, I'm telling you, if I was ever a detective, I'm having, I'm putting a bunch of coins in my

479
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:58,750
pocket. I'm going to walk around like a tambourine. I'm going to make sure that, like, I'm going to

480
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:04,670
wear, like, leather so it makes like... I'm going to be fucking loud as fuck if I go anywhere. I'm

481
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:09,390
going to be making all kinds of noise. Like, I'm going to lean down to stretch and look at, like,

482
01:27:09,949 --> 01:27:19,979
where the body was. Yeah, interesting. Light up a cigarette. How'd they die?

483
01:27:19,979 --> 01:27:28,899
Sure, am I just going to accuse this? Am I going to accuse her of this?

484
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,819
Worst joke? Why? I thought it was humorous.

485
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:52,590
You did it because you're a member of the Run and Grow Free and you're trying to protect the

486
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:57,149
wolf at any cost, aren't you? That's why you have that magazine in your room so you figure out how

487
01:27:57,149 --> 01:28:09,489
to keep Olly Randall from shooting the wolf. These are both the same thing, aren't they?

488
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:11,890
If you didn't find this bullet, it would have ended up in your back.

489
01:28:34,779 --> 01:28:39,180
I don't want to see anything happen to that wolf either. If you belong to Run and Grow Free,

490
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:45,260
just tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets, believe me. You're right, I am a member of the Run and Grow Free.

491
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,579
I'm a detective, aren't I trying to... I did make sure that brute would miss if he took a shot at

492
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:56,380
the wolf, and I will do whatever it takes to protect that beautiful creature. Hey, we're talking

493
01:28:56,380 --> 01:29:01,569
about a potential crime that's being committed, but just tell me. I mean, just tell me the crime

494
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:12,449
you're committing. I can keep a secret so you're undercover. So you're here undercover? Yes.

495
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:21,739
What are you going to do next? What are you going to do next? That's all I'm going to tell you, Nancy.

496
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:36,000
And if you really are concerned about the wolf's welfare, you won't repeat any of this to anyone.

497
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:54,270
Let's not talk anymore, Nancy. People are starting to get suspicious. R1, R1, R1, R1, R1. Hey, hey,

498
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:58,989
you wouldn't believe what the fuck is going on in this lodge. Wait, can I talk to you?

499
01:29:58,989 --> 01:30:06,270
Nancy, hi. What the heck happened out there? Actually, I'm not quite sure. I walked out to

500
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:10,829
Icicle Lake to see how you were doing in the fishing shack, only there wasn't any fishing

501
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:16,670
shack. There wasn't even a lake. The ice was all busted up like somebody dropped a bomb on it.

502
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:21,710
All I know is... I wouldn't want to be told any of this shit. I walked outside and someone knocked me

503
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:26,510
unconscious with an ice ball. The next thing I knew there was an explosion and I was on an ice

504
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:31,229
flow in the middle of the lake with no code and no fish. Somebody decked you with an ice

505
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:38,909
ball and blew up the lake? Holy moly. The good news is you're okay. The bad news? No more ice fishing.

506
01:30:41,789 --> 01:30:45,869
I mean, I don't know, if like a detective came up to me and was like, hey, hey, listen to all this

507
01:30:45,869 --> 01:30:52,340
shit that's going on. Hey, by the way, I know it's her. It'd be like, who? Oh, hey, the lady by the

508
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:59,300
window with the binoculars. Watch the fuck out. It's like, oh, but the arrestor, what are you

509
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:11,010
talking about? Yeah, by the way, hey, just want to let you know, she dropped a bullet. What? Yeah,

510
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:19,060
shut up, don't do that, I'm not supposed to tell anybody. You're not a cop. Oh, no, that's right.

511
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:30,050
I'm just like an investigative enthusiast, right? What is Nancy Drew's, what's Nancy Drew for a

512
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:53,920
career? You're literally like 16. Nancy Drew is just like a teenager. Oh, she's a true crime

513
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:07,380
podcast fan. Oh, since Mr. Talbot isn't here, could I play a game of fox and geese with you?

514
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:14,020
You bet. Have a seat. Here are the rules. Oh, no, I don't want to do this. The black piece is the fox.

515
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:18,260
The goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move, while the goal of the fox

516
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:23,060
is to gobble up geese so that they can't corner him. The geese can only move forward along a

517
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:28,020
line to the next point, either directly forwards, diagonally, or sideways. You gotta slow down. Same

518
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:32,819
thing for the fox, except when he's next to a goose that has an empty spot directly behind it.

519
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:38,819
He can jump over it. Gobble it up. Right, gobble it up and remove it from the board. Dave. Just take

520
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:43,779
turns and play until somebody wins and somebody loses. Dave, I just found a bullet on the ground.

521
01:32:43,779 --> 01:32:52,079
I don't want to do this. No, I don't. I really don't want to do this. I don't. The goal is to...

522
01:32:53,199 --> 01:33:03,819
Let me read this for a minute. Okay. The goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move.

523
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:10,300
The goal of the fox is to gobble up the geese so they can't corner him. The geese can only move

524
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:15,100
forward along a line to the next point, so the geese can only move forward. They can't go diagonal.

525
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:22,720
No, they can go diagonal, but they can only move one space, except when he's next to a goose that

526
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:28,699
has an empty spot behind it, he can just brute force the puzzle because it can't be that hard.

527
01:33:29,869 --> 01:34:45,260
You bet. What team am I on? Shit in my... No! Can't restart. I don't... I take these things.

528
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:50,619
If I walk by and there's a puzzle like this being played, I walk right by it,

529
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:55,979
or I lean over to two people playing it and I go, oh, interesting. You want to play? No, no,

530
01:34:55,979 --> 01:34:59,819
no, no, no, no. You guys are doing pretty sick. You guys are good. I don't play... I would never

531
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:05,550
play this. I would glance over and say, cool, and then I would never talk about it ever again.

532
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:25,739
Whatever. I don't... It doesn't matter. There. Now you... Okay, I have to restart. I gotta back away.

533
01:35:26,619 --> 01:35:38,850
Okay, if we start over. Oh my god. Okay, what is the... What's the... I don't know. I know it's about

534
01:35:38,850 --> 01:36:12,899
patience and I have none of that. Watch this spot down here. All right, you cannot go anywhere. I've

535
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:18,819
got you locked right here. Actually can't do anything. Cannot go anywhere. Now we close it in.

536
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:32,640
Slowly close it in. You can't go that way. All right, if you go up, you could take that out. If

537
01:36:32,640 --> 01:37:35,010
you go up, you... All right. Slowly close it in. Okay. Okay, now... No! Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.

538
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:44,579
I got it, I got it. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I don't... I fucking don't know. I fucked it up. It's okay.

539
01:37:44,579 --> 01:38:14,979
You actually can't go anywhere. Okay, now... I got greedy. I win. I win. Not yet. I need to...

540
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:29,939
Did I win? But will... I think he'll just jump it. Won't he just jump it? Oh my god, what just

541
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:33,619
happened? I fucking hate this. I want to delete this so bad. I would flip the table at this point.

542
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:39,069
I don't know what just happened. I fucking hate this shit. I never play these. I avoid these like

543
01:38:39,069 --> 01:38:44,350
the... I avoid them because I don't want to play these. I don't like... I don't play checkers,

544
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:47,470
I don't play chess. Everyone... I've had people ask me, oh, are you interested in playing chess?

545
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:52,350
No, zero. It's a big brains. A lot of brains involved. I'm not saying I have a small brain.

546
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:56,029
I'm just saying a very particular brain that does particular things pretty well. This is not one of

547
01:38:56,029 --> 01:39:02,180
them. I had it. I... Dude, I know I had it. You know the guy who stabbed that? Don't save it.

548
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:11,140
Just quit and just start over. I hate these fucking things. It's not even hard. It's just like...

549
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:35,729
Yeah, I have to sit there and just like... I thought I just won. This game is best for an

550
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:55,340
ages nine and up. Yeah, I know at the age... I know the rating it has. Now I'm just fucking tilted.

551
01:39:55,340 --> 01:40:04,020
I'm just... I don't want to be doing this. Okay, if we start over. Where's the part where I could

552
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,659
like sprint wicked fast for a few minutes? You know what I mean? Like where's that part?

553
01:40:12,100 --> 01:41:14,430
I had it. I know. I just don't care. I just want to flip this. Fuck out of here. Now you're stuck

554
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:39,439
here. Now you're stuck here. Now I can bring everything down safely, right? Yes. Now I can

555
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:52,350
go down. We're good. Now this is where I screw it up. If I go down here, can't go left, but he can

556
01:41:52,350 --> 01:42:01,329
go that way. So let me think about this. If I go down, it's going here, which means I had... This

557
01:42:01,329 --> 01:42:10,850
one has to be here, right? I'm just planning this out. So if he goes here, I don't... So then this

558
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:19,010
one needs to be moved as well. We don't want to give him any opportunity. This means he cannot

559
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:27,680
go diagonal from here. So if I go down with this one, he can jump it. If I go down with this one

560
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:46,880
right now, he cannot. Save it right now. Oh, nice. So let's see what happens. Okay. I'm scared.

561
01:43:37,899 --> 01:43:47,500
No! I saw it. I saw it the last second. I hate these fucking games. No, it doesn't let you cheat.

562
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,649
It doesn't let you cheat. It doesn't let you cheat. It doesn't... Oh my God. Why did I...

563
01:43:51,649 --> 01:43:56,930
It's one little mistake. Just fucked the whole thing up. I hate this. I don't want to do this.

564
01:44:10,899 --> 01:44:22,079
What went so wrong there? God damn it. Fuck you. I would never bring this to Friday night game night

565
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:59,760
ever. Where you going? Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that?

566
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:31,939
Why is he doing that? He can't go this way, right? Can he go this way? He cannot go this way. Can he?

567
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:54,699
No. No, no, no. Okay. Oh my God. I can't... Oh my God. I can't do it. I don't think I can do it,

568
01:45:54,779 --> 01:46:00,220
guys. I don't think I can fucking do it. I think I have to literally get a save file from some fucking

569
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:14,670
random ass website. I fucking hate this more than anything. I hate this shit. I hate this shit.

570
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:20,000
I can't play these. I can't... I just don't have the... I just don't have... I could do it and I'm

571
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,579
going to shut the heck up and I'm going to beat it right now. Start the timer. We're not sitting

572
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:29,500
here anymore. I promise. All of you that are sitting there that are thinking, I can't believe

573
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:40,779
this guy... I can't believe this guy drives a car. I got you. Just relax. What would this have to do

574
01:46:40,779 --> 01:47:13,010
with driving a car anyways? It's not like you do this when you stop at a stop sign. I can't do

575
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:25,140
anything. He's stuck. I can move this here and it's safe. No, I can't do that. Okay. Wait a minute.

576
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:32,270
What if I put him up here? No. Should I put him up there? Worst gamer moment. These things are

577
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:39,630
annoying and hard. I guarantee you. You sit... 90% of you down. You ain't going to beat this in five

578
01:47:39,630 --> 01:48:03,300
minutes. What should I move? I just... I'm so paranoid that I'm going to just miss something.

579
01:48:03,939 --> 01:48:09,710
I wonder if the other guy got up because he was kicking his ass for three straight days in a lodge

580
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:19,659
and that's all you guys can do is sit here. Oh my god. I can't even see it. I can't even comprehend

581
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:26,180
it. My brain is not wired to be able to understand how this game works in every single facet of it.

582
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:31,789
This is like the one... If a bomb was going to go off, get me out of this room. Don't give

583
01:48:31,789 --> 01:48:54,689
this to me. It's not going to happen. God damn it. I fucking want to get out of here so bad.

584
01:48:54,689 --> 01:49:03,899
Okay, we start over. It's so... It's not hard. It's just there are so many places to screw it up.

585
01:49:03,899 --> 01:49:47,649
All right. I'm going to get it this time. All right. Trust me. That's safe. Everything is safe

586
01:49:47,649 --> 01:49:56,939
if I do it here. There's nothing. You can jump over here so I can start closing the gap here.

587
01:49:56,939 --> 01:50:03,180
As long as I move this and then the other one right behind it immediately.

588
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:19,949
Okay. You're stuck here. Same deal. Wait. I got to be aware of this. So move... What should I... I

589
01:50:19,949 --> 01:50:32,340
don't know what to do first. Putting this here is free. It would ruin everything. So moving this

590
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:39,140
would have to see what he moves. If I put this here and he moves diagonal. I don't know. Maybe

591
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:48,449
I should move one of these down. This one down because then he has to go up and then from here

592
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:58,659
you've got nothing. You've got nothing. You've got nothing. So I can safely move this here

593
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:15,789
or this forward. You've got nothing. Okay. You've got... You've got nothing. This is coming down.

594
01:51:15,789 --> 01:51:35,090
You've got nothing. This is coming down. You've got nothing. You've got nothing here. There's no

595
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:47,550
diagonal to here. So I can move this. You'll come down and you got nothing. By the way. You've got

596
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:59,859
nothing. All right. Now we come down with it. Right? Come down with this one and down with this one.

597
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:04,180
You've got no... You can't... You literally can't go anywhere. So just bring these ones down

598
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:18,510
where I can. All right. Now what? Now what? Should I try to do what I did before and just keep them

599
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:30,930
down here? Is that the right play? Keeping them down here. Is that the right play? All right.

600
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:37,170
We're solid right now. Actually has nowhere to go. Now I don't want to mess this up. And I'm going

601
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:50,180
to if I don't... I'm going to mess this up big time. If I put this one down then it's bad.

602
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:58,380
This one comes down it's over. This one comes down it's not over. If I put the middle one down.

603
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:06,960
If I put this down and he goes to the diagonal. I'm in trouble aren't I? I could have one move

604
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:16,449
to bring the one down which should save me. Right? Middle coming down blocks everything he's doing.

605
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:31,779
Now he can go... He can only go this way so I can block that here. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait,

606
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:39,329
wait, wait. Block that. He has to go back down. So he ends up here and I have these two. So you

607
01:53:39,329 --> 01:53:45,470
end up right here with two here. He can't... If I go down then he'll go that way and I'm going to

608
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:59,600
bring another one down. Should I... Okay this one or the middle one? I'm not sure because I think

609
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:06,880
it's both scary. Or do I bring this down again? But that will I think open up too many opportunities.

610
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:20,159
I think I'm bringing the right one down. Okay. Then I'm bringing this one down that blocks him

611
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:24,079
so he can go right. He's going to go right. I'll block that. He's going to go right again.

612
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:31,149
I don't... I can't block it again. What? What? Hey what happened? What? What? Huh? Huh? Huh?

613
01:54:31,149 --> 01:54:41,069
Excuse me. What's going on? What just happened? Why did it move? What just happened? Okay we're

614
01:54:41,069 --> 01:54:54,300
fine. He went up. Bring middle down or do I bring this one down? If I bring this down here

615
01:54:54,300 --> 01:55:07,180
then he has to go right. This is... I think this is correct. So many people don't know.

616
01:55:09,579 --> 01:55:22,060
I don't want to mess this up. I swear. This one going down or this one come down? Bro he's

617
01:55:22,859 --> 01:55:33,329
stupid. I just don't want to mess it up. I just don't want to screw it up. The top one,

618
01:55:33,329 --> 01:55:42,100
this one comes down. That's what I was thinking. That's correct, right? Yes. That's what I would

619
01:55:42,100 --> 01:55:48,420
have done. All right. Now I can't come down. I can't come down. We just have to start moving

620
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:57,329
other stuff down because if I move anything it's over. This has to come down. He's now...

621
01:55:57,329 --> 01:56:26,420
She's trapped here. He can't do anything. This comes down. Ah! What? I'm safe as long as I'm

622
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:29,460
going to get everything in the right spot. If even it comes up here I can't... All right. Bring

623
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:48,340
everything down. Okay. All right. Now this comes down. If he moves to the right then I block it.

624
01:56:48,340 --> 01:57:06,930
Right? Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Wait. He's gonna move down. If I move this then he'll be

625
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:37,140
able to get that. Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Blocked. Okay. Blocked. Now. I got him!

626
01:57:40,689 --> 01:58:02,619
What just happened? Did I lose? Did I win? Did it take too long? He fell asleep.

627
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:22,989
It was optional. You have to win this three times. No, I don't. How about another game? No.

628
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:31,810
It's three games. No, it's not. I don't remember any of that. I would just watch the VOD.

629
01:58:32,449 --> 01:58:40,500
It's just a side game. No, it's definitely not seven times. It's just optional. Well, I thought

630
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,779
he was gonna give me an item or something. All right. Well, now what the hell am I doing now?

631
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:52,289
Oh, now what? Well, sorry to bother you. You want to talk? You know where to find me.

632
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:18,579
Whatever. Well, okay. Fine. Now what? Oh, it's time for dinner. Oops. Oopsie. Um, okay. This is fun.

633
01:59:18,579 --> 01:59:30,109
This is a fun game. Hope everyone's having a good time. I'm having a good time. I need to cook.

634
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:40,029
Where's the door? I have no object permanence. Nancy, Chantal's calling. Again?

635
01:59:40,829 --> 01:59:56,079
Lunch. I'm never here. I'm never here to cook food. Oh, God. This is elaborate.

636
01:59:57,229 --> 02:00:07,260
One salad with a bunch of bullshit in it. Oh, my goodness. Okay. What is salmon and or a salad.

637
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:12,939
Cook salmon on the griddle and remove when it turns bright orange pink. Put extra salad ingredients

638
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:20,180
in the salad bowl on top of the lettuce. All salads are to be topped with the Lodge's famous

639
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:25,489
Icicle Creek ranch dressing. What if somebody doesn't want ranch dressing? We just put it on

640
02:00:25,489 --> 02:00:33,409
everything. Why would I? What if somebody says don't put any sauce on it? Do I say? I don't

641
02:00:33,409 --> 02:00:54,369
care. I saw it comes. What do you want? One say, let's get this right. One salmon. Okay. Now you

642
02:00:54,369 --> 02:00:59,409
want three egg, three. I'm going to have to look at this like five times. Don't want any anchovies

643
02:00:59,409 --> 02:01:07,869
and no croutons. Three egg, three yellow peppers. Does all salad have lettuce? Which one? This is

644
02:01:07,869 --> 02:01:17,649
lettuce. Does all salad have lettuce on it? Yeah. Okay. Three eggs, three yellow peppers, two

645
02:01:17,649 --> 02:01:26,909
tomatoes. Three eggs. Dude, that's a lot of eggs. Three yellow peppers. That's kind of a fucked up

646
02:01:26,909 --> 02:01:46,140
salad. Two tomatoes, two spinach, three carrots, three cucumbers. Okay. Here you go. Salad. Enjoy.

647
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:58,880
Order up. What do you want? Two salmons and then one salad with two egg and then a bunch of other

648
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:20,430
stuff. Two eggs, one yellow pepper, two tomato, two spinach, one anchovy, three carrots, three

649

Two egg, three yellow peppers. One, two, three. One tomato, one spinach, two anchovy, one carrot,

651
02:02:51,020 --> 02:03:04,979
and three cucumber, two croutons. There you go. Order up. Just want a salad. Two egg, three yellow

652
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:48,960
peppers. I can't remember this. Okay, we're good. What do you want? Two egg, three yellow peppers.

653
02:03:48,960 --> 02:04:04,930
One, two, three. Two tomatoes, two spinach. Okay. One carrot, one cucumber. Easy. And then three

654
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:17,300
croutons, right? Yeah. Order up. Are you de-boning the fish? No, I don't think so. All right. Two of

655
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:23,359
these. What do you want? Do you want any of that? All right. What? Put four on. You're both getting

656
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:39,840
salad. Yes, they're both getting salad. I put, oh, what just happened? All right. They're both

657
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:49,979
getting a salad. Did I just frisbee that? Where did that just go? All right. You're both getting

salads. You both want one egg, two yellow peppers, both two yellow peppers, one tomato, two tomato,

661
02:05:43,760 --> 02:06:05,340
And then you wanted two. Order up. We're done. We're good. Okay. Very nice. Now I did that.

662
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:14,210
Everything's good. We were in the middle of trying to figure out what this is. Okay, we've got a

663
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:25,470
okay, it's a four. Wait, what's that? No, no, no. What is that on the wall? On the wall, on the wall,

664
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:31,460
on the wall. Come on. You're not going to do this to me right now. Come on to the wall. What's that?

665
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:45,340
No, we're in Canada. All right. What's Canadian? Canadian, um, hockey, maple syrup, um, trees,

666
02:06:45,340 --> 02:07:06,909
mountains, snow, poutine. All right. We're good. Who cares? When do I get to go to sleep by the way?

667
02:07:06,909 --> 02:07:21,979
Hmm. Should I go upstairs? I feel like people are in their rooms now. Let me see. Right. People in

668
02:07:21,979 --> 02:07:41,250
their rooms or anything? No, I don't get it. We can name one human being who is not yourself. Um,

669
02:07:41,250 --> 02:08:00,289
anymore? Why am I stuck here? What's going on? What do you want? You messed with my rifle,

670
02:08:00,289 --> 02:08:06,689
didn't you? This I got to hear. What? Excuse me? This fact just came for you. It's from the

671
02:08:06,689 --> 02:08:13,170
wacko left-wing wildlife gang that paid you to screw up my rifle so I'd miss that wolf.

672
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:18,930
Talk to me like that. I'm leaving this place right now. Good. You just got yourself an escort off

673
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:35,329
the premises. What happened? Hey, wait, wait. No, I'm the detective. Come talk to me. Wait.

674
02:08:35,329 --> 02:08:48,430
I'm not going outside now. It's too cold. What the heck? That's for me. What? Nancy, because of that

675
02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:52,989
Neanderthal of a handyman, I've been forced to return home. Please call me. When it comes

676
02:08:52,989 --> 02:09:00,380
to the white wolf, there was much for us to talk about. All right. Let's call you on a secure line.

677
02:09:00,380 --> 02:09:16,819
Two, one, three, five, five, five. Just do the two, one, three part. Two, one, three, three, two,

678
02:09:16,819 --> 02:09:30,850
six, four. Two, one, three, three, two, six, four. What was it? Two, two, one, two, one, three,

679
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:57,310
three, two, six, four. What? Hi, this is Nancy Drew. I'll call you later. Oh, no. Call now.

680
02:09:57,949 --> 02:10:41,869
What was it? Three, three, two, six, four. Still not there. Still not there. She just left. Give her

681
02:10:41,869 --> 02:10:46,819
a few minutes. What am I going to do for a few minutes? I got to go talk to that guy.

682
02:10:51,729 --> 02:11:13,539
Walking around. You hear that? Who's walking around? What you need? What's going on here?

683
02:11:13,539 --> 02:11:18,260
I couldn't help but overhear the argument you and Miss Camille had. She messed up my

684
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:22,979
raffle so I couldn't shoot that wolf. So I tossed her out, told her to take her little crusade

685
02:11:22,979 --> 02:11:29,949
somewhere else. Tell. Have you told Chantal that you threw her out? Chantal that? Not yet.

686
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:34,909
She's not going to be happy. But by golly, that woman was a menace. Anybody who deliberately

687
02:11:34,909 --> 02:11:40,029
sabotage a man's rifle is capable of anything. But at least now I know why I miss that wolf.

688
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:45,229
And like I told her as I was giving her the bum's rush next time, I won't miss.

689
02:11:49,020 --> 02:12:04,060
Oh, that's why you missed. Thumbs up some major copium. Oh, hasn't your rifle been?

690
02:12:05,630 --> 02:12:12,659
I'd better get back upstairs. If you need anything, just holler.

691
02:12:12,659 --> 02:12:17,760
Copium. Yeah, all of you guys would be saying no skill issue, skill issue.

692
02:12:18,640 --> 02:13:05,819
All right. Can I call her now? Was it three, two, six, four? Still not there. So now what do I

693
02:13:05,819 --> 02:13:13,819
got to do? I can't leave. I'm not going outside now. It's too cold. Call in the morning maybe.

694
02:13:14,619 --> 02:13:24,140
Can I just go to bed? I feel like there's not much else I can do right now. Call 1555 Mystico

695
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:31,659
and prepare to be amazed. There's not even enough numbers on a keypad to type that in.

696
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:47,649
Whoever came up with that jingle. What are you talking about? Go call it? There's not even that

697
02:13:47,649 --> 02:14:06,109
many numbers. That doesn't make any sense. What was it? Mystico, 1555, 1555, 1555, 1555, call

698
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:19,020
it. What is it? 1555, M, Y, S, T, I, C, O?

699
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:26,130
Who dares disturb the concentration of Mystico the Magnificent?

700
02:14:27,550 --> 02:14:35,789
Um, I'm sorry. This is Nancy Drew. Nancy Drew, I see your future clear as tape.

701
02:14:35,789 --> 02:14:44,430
I see. That's too many numbers. And a dark figure named Bruno. Bruno. Bruno? But beware,

702
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:52,750
Nancy Drew. The wolf will only lead to danger and intrigue. Cool. I mean, yes, Mystico.

703
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:58,109
The Magnificent. Huh? You're supposed to say Mystico the Magnificent.

704
02:14:59,069 --> 02:15:07,390
Oh, right. Yes, Mystico the Magnificent. So Nancy Drew, what secrets from the beyond do you seek?

705
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:14,819
A hint. What do you think I am? An insurance salesman, a pair of underage

706
02:15:14,819 --> 02:15:21,939
detectives, a star-struck teenager, a watch the police officer, an elderly housekeeper, a parrot?

707
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:31,380
You have incurred the wrath of Mystico. From this moment forward, bad luck shall creep behind you

708
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:39,010
like a malevolent shadow. Don't say that. Mystico has spoken. Now, why would you say that to me?

709
02:15:39,649 --> 02:16:07,470
What the heck? Do that? People sad. Well, I'm just going to go to bed. Isn't this my room?

710
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:24,460
This is my room. This is my room. Where's my room? This is my room. Which one of these is mine?

711
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:58,670
Isn't it this one? It's the one that's locked. If you put your face cam on, we'll tell you.

712
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:08,100
You would like me to turn my face cam on, wouldn't you? Check my items.

713
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:19,809
Okay, I need to call her in the morning. It's this thing. I haven't seen any of these. I don't

714
02:17:19,809 --> 02:17:27,409
know what that's trying to tell me. What is this? Oh, that's the fishing toolbox. I already did that.

715
02:17:27,409 --> 02:17:41,409
Here's the bullet. I already called this. This is the book of things going on. I don't know.

716
02:17:57,219 --> 02:18:02,540
What about her room? I'm going up to her room because, okay, she just got like kicked out,

717
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:14,180
right? Maybe she left something behind? I don't know. What was the word I said again?

718
02:18:14,180 --> 02:18:48,610
Oh, lolly. Did he leave something behind? I mean, it's 730 at night. It's getting kind of late.

719
02:18:48,610 --> 02:19:01,409
I can't leave, so there's got to be something I can do here. This is weird, too. What is this?

720
02:19:01,409 --> 02:19:07,739
Why does it want me to look at this? 730 isn't late. Well, it's late enough where I can't leave

721
02:19:07,739 --> 02:19:31,020
the lodge. I need to get the snowshoes. How do I get the snowshoes from him? I don't get it.

722
02:19:37,469 --> 02:19:39,629
I can talk to this guy again.

723
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:54,799
Do you have no other dialogue? No. What about the sauna? The sauna's just hanging out here.

724
02:19:54,799 --> 02:20:01,709
Is there anything I can do with the sauna? I don't know. What's this for?

725
02:20:01,950 --> 02:20:26,110
I don't know. Lala or pre-recorded. That's the worst way to get me to do that.

726
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:57,340
Save the game. This is the first game that I ever played. It's a good one, so I can't leave.

727
02:21:00,139 --> 02:21:14,719
So I have to call that number. You're just not available. Go to bed? I can't. I can't go to sleep.

728
02:21:16,829 --> 02:21:38,129
Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.

729
02:21:38,129 --> 02:22:12,610
Oh, it's closed, though. What do I do? Are these symbols in the... Wait a minute. What about that

730
02:22:12,610 --> 02:22:18,989
device that's sitting on the table? Where is it? With the wolf face and this thing. Have I not

731
02:22:18,989 --> 02:22:24,209
figured out what the hell this means yet? I have to know what is going on here, right? I have to

732
02:22:24,209 --> 02:22:50,110
know what this means. What is this? You know what I'm saying? There's nothing under the table.

733
02:22:50,110 --> 02:23:04,579
What about that symbol note? Yeah, but what... Okay, is there... Do the animals have symbols

734
02:23:04,579 --> 02:23:29,420
next to them somewhere? I think it means... I'm not reading that. It's the Saga of the White Wolf.

735
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:38,879
Don't forget. Yeah, I know. So what? What does that mean? What does that mean? Why are you saying

736
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:48,190
that? Why are you putting that in quotes? Don't forget. It's the Saga of the White Wolf. Why are

737
02:23:48,190 --> 02:24:15,260
you saying that? What's that? Is that a book? Is that a book up here? Where are the books? How do

738
02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:47,329
I go to sleep? Skip. I'm trying not to spin in circles. Go that way. Who had that book? Saga of

739
02:24:47,329 --> 02:25:17,659
the Winter Sports Monthly. The Call of the Wild. That's not it. I thought this was going to be it.

740
02:25:17,659 --> 02:25:37,709
Where is it? It's the Saga of the White Wolf. Damn it. I don't know where to go. Engineering,

741
02:25:38,270 --> 02:25:50,000
geology, machines. Wait, what was that crumpled up piece of paper? It's all totally unfair and

742
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,979
I'm sick of putting up with things that aren't fair. It's his fault, her fault, their fault,

743
02:25:55,059 --> 02:26:00,579
but I don't have what's rightfully mine. They are thieves and it's an insult to have what they

744
02:26:00,579 --> 02:26:07,500
stole from us waved around in my face. I could throttle them, both of them, for what they did.

745
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:21,360
Justice shall be served one day. One day I will have justice. Whose room is this? Pish one? Pish

746
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:45,760
Pish is who? Bill Kessler. Okay, Bill, that's your room. Snowshoes on the ground? Are those snowshoes?

747
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:55,469
I don't think I can look down and get them. Other room? Those are slippers, dude.

748
02:26:56,129 --> 02:27:06,030
Just get out there in slippers. God damn it. Where am I going? Okay, I need to fucking focus

749
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:13,069
for one goddamn second. The same shit happens to me in Myst when it's just pictures. Instead of

750
02:27:13,069 --> 02:27:23,020
actually moving, my brain does not let me put it into memory. This is Bill's room. No, this is my

751
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:52,399
room. Whose fucking room is this? Where are the snowshoes? Get them. I can't pick them up. I can't

752
02:27:52,399 --> 02:28:27,340
touch them. No stealing. I've been walking around in a simulated hour. Please lala into your

753
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:46,799
microphone. Need to check the den? What the fuck is this? What are these? Snowshoes. I thought

754
02:28:46,799 --> 02:29:12,989
these were tennis rackets. Wait a minute. Do I have something here? What's this? How do I get that?

755
02:29:12,989 --> 02:29:25,790
Heat and moisture sometimes cause the door of the sauna to stick. Periodically check to make sure

756
02:29:25,790 --> 02:30:00,370
that no guests are inside. What? That sounds pretty bad. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

757
02:30:00,370 --> 02:30:10,670
She was full of shit. There are no eagles in the winter. There are no orioles in the winter.

758
02:30:10,670 --> 02:30:33,649
She's a liar. Not watching birds at all. There's booze in that. Don't we already know that she

759
02:30:33,649 --> 02:30:42,989
wasn't bird watching? She told us. Interesting. That's right. Good detectives always stick together

760
02:30:42,989 --> 02:30:56,350
by the tens of thousands. So, you know, you know, I'll work on a case with me to get there. Imagine

761
02:30:56,350 --> 02:31:12,899
being a detective and having fucking twitch chat. Oh my god. What a fucking nightmare. All right. I

762
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:17,459
need to figure out how to get these. It's a four digit code. What's the code? Like is it a number?

763
02:31:17,459 --> 02:31:29,809
It's numbers. Okay. You know, I've seen, I've seen this number in the chat. Drew Crew spammed this so

764
02:31:29,809 --> 02:31:40,379
he opens it. I think this is cheating. The Drew Crew wants me to hurry up and finish this. I mean,

765
02:31:40,379 --> 02:31:44,540
I'm, I'm, I can't pretend like I haven't seen the number like a thousand times.

766
02:31:49,600 --> 02:32:02,690
Everybody's writing this. It's four. It's. Oh, now they're fucking it all up. Okay.

767
02:32:07,969 --> 02:32:15,090
Drew Crew spammed this so he sees. It's not even real. I'm going to get it on my own. Okay. And by

768
02:32:15,090 --> 02:32:23,440
on my own, I mean, I want you to help me get there. I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions

769
02:32:23,440 --> 02:32:33,709
and I would like for you to answer them. I am the detective. I'm asking you. It's time for your

770
02:32:33,709 --> 02:32:50,190
questioning. You've looked at that dog breath. I feel like that sometimes. Oh, check on somebody,

771
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:58,899
dude. I think the balls are stuck to the bottom. I think we're okay, man. Nice talking to you.

772
02:32:58,899 --> 02:33:12,340
Been real. What's up? Nice talking to you. Ditto, dude. It's something with this, right? But I don't

773
02:33:12,340 --> 02:33:18,799
know. I need the snowshoes. I got to figure out what that because this is telling me what the code

774
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:27,729
is, but that where are their numbers? Are there numbers somewhere that I've like with symbols

775
02:33:27,729 --> 02:33:38,139
next to them? Cause I don't, I don't know what this would be next to the numbers are on the note.

776
02:33:40,110 --> 02:34:15,760
This is not, these are symbols. It's mirrored. What are you talking about? This is a four,

777
02:34:16,719 --> 02:34:40,930
a one, an eight, a nine. What do you mean? It's mirrored. How does he not see it? It's guys.

778
02:34:42,049 --> 02:34:54,639
Hold on. Seven, nine, one, four. But I know, but I thought this, but I'll buy it. Hold on a second.

779
02:34:54,639 --> 02:35:02,530
Hold on a second. I get that. But what I'm looking for is I see this shit all over the place. I see

780
02:35:02,530 --> 02:35:08,059
these. Hold on a minute. Like I saw, I saw like this triangle and I was like, okay, triangle,

781
02:35:08,059 --> 02:35:16,829
maybe that's like, hold on. I'm looking for symbols that I have a number. I forgot this game was made

782
02:35:16,829 --> 02:35:36,270
for children. Okay. Well not adults too. We can enjoy these for everybody. What was it? Seven,

783
02:35:36,270 --> 02:35:47,549
one, seven, nine. What is it? What is it? Seven, nine, eight, seven, nine, one, four. That's not

784
02:35:47,549 --> 02:36:00,239
correct. That's incorrect. That's incorrect. You guys don't have it right. Seven, nine, one,

785
02:36:00,239 --> 02:36:23,379
four is incorrect. Seven, nine, one, four. Four, one, nine, seven. What's happening right now?

786
02:36:23,379 --> 02:36:39,860
Because I don't think this is right. You guys are all wrong. Four, one, write it correctly. Four, one,

787
02:36:45,790 --> 02:37:01,180
that's not correct. You guys got it wrong. Seven, nine, one, four. Drew. Yeah. The Drew crew has

788
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:26,700
failed. Keep it in mind. That's a shoelace. Seven, nine, one, four. So what's, what's going on here?

789
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:49,700
Is it like an accept button? Press enter. If that's for something else then. Well,

790
02:37:49,700 --> 02:38:06,719
shit. That might be for the suitcase. Maybe it's backwards. Yeah. I'll put it in. I just did it

791
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:26,829
backwards too. Maybe a year. Not like 19, 1940s, 1947. Would it be a year? I don't know. I don't

792
02:38:26,829 --> 02:38:34,110
know. No, it's definitely, that's for something else. Read the plaque.

793
02:38:34,110 --> 02:38:42,799
Snowshoes owned and used by Trapper Dan in the early 1900s. Right. That didn't work. What about

794
02:38:42,799 --> 02:39:12,590
1974? No. What about seven? Hold on. Seven, six. No, that's not going to be a six. That's nine.

795
02:39:12,590 --> 02:39:39,180
Oh wait. I'm going to call the number. Still not there. It's a six. Oh my God. I'm dying. You think

796
02:39:39,180 --> 02:40:05,899
it's a six? So it would be seven, seven, six, one, four. Time that person up for one second.

797
02:40:05,899 --> 02:40:22,209
Look at the wall. Oh my God. Hold on. Trapper Dan started construction of what is known today

798
02:40:22,209 --> 02:40:29,860
as the Ice Creek in 1894. It served as his center of operations until the winter of 1921.

799
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:37,860
When he vanished without a trace in 1934, the lodge was purchased by Abe Wentworth who maintained

800
02:40:37,860 --> 02:41:14,659
it as a hunting lodge until, okay, 1894. 1934. 19, let's just write 19, 19, 1934. 19, 1930. I don't

801
02:41:14,659 --> 02:42:03,200
know. 1980. You're wrong. All of you. All of you are wrong. Seven, six, six, nine. You're wrong too.

802
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:50,430
At some point, who's coming over here and going, Nancy, what are you doing over there?

803
02:42:50,430 --> 02:43:10,000
Call the number. I just did. You have to call Tino. What the fuck? Tino, are you awake?

804
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:30,430
I need help. I think that'll do it. Thanks, Tino. Can't I just be like, what's the code for the

805
02:43:30,430 --> 02:43:36,700
snowshoes? Cause I need them. Why is this so difficult? Can I, can somebody get me snowshoes?

806
02:43:36,700 --> 02:44:01,500
Hi, Chantal. It's Nancy Drew. Not quite yet. This is a lot of questions. How come the entries for

807
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:08,340
last year were deleted from the guest register? That's what the computer says. Contents deleted.

808
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:30,340
Well, I didn't. Okay. Ollie's daughter? Has she done other things like that? No. I think that's

809
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:34,819
only in movies. Besides, pretty much all this person had to do was press the delete key.

810
02:44:34,819 --> 02:44:55,309
Maybe it was on the kid? I'd like to know more about the accidents. I asked Ollie, but he said

811
02:44:55,309 --> 02:45:30,579
you said he wasn't allowed to talk about them. The guest server. Okay. I'm not listening. I'm

812
02:45:30,579 --> 02:46:03,420
not paying any attention by the way. But the only incidents that you can be sure were sabotage were

813
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:08,059
the tires, the phone wires, and maybe the explosion in the bunkhouse. I gotta send this. I gotta do

814
02:46:08,059 --> 02:46:24,610
the survey. Where's the survey? I better get back to work. No, I had to go. No, I had to go. Don't

815
02:46:24,610 --> 02:46:28,690
one-up me. Don't one-up me during our conversation. Hey, I'm wicked busy. You got a lot of stuff going

816
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:33,090
on. I'm out of here. Oh, I'm actually wicked busy too. Yeah. I was just about to leave. No, I was.

817
02:46:33,090 --> 02:46:49,329
You weren't. I was about to leave. Okay. How do I fill out this survey? Is it on the computer

818
02:46:49,329 --> 02:47:20,500
or something? Like where's the survey? In your inventory. No, it's not. What kind of weird social?

819
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:34,319
I'm just kidding. I don't actually think that. Or does he? All right. So I don't have this thing

820
02:47:34,319 --> 02:48:03,680
you're talking about. Let's see. Get the guest survey. I was, when I just talked. Give me the

821
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:20,129
survey. Hi, it's Nancy Drew. Yes, but he said no. Darn. I can't. There's nobody. I just talked.

822
02:48:20,129 --> 02:48:26,110
There's no guest. The guests that are in the lodge now. Did any of them stay here last year?

823
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:47,090
About Tino. About Tino. I'm not totally comfortable with the idea of consulting with him on this case.

824
02:48:47,090 --> 02:49:12,620
Okay. Do you know what he did when we were on that train trip Laurie Gerard arranged?

825
02:49:12,620 --> 02:49:35,360
Understood. Anything else? No. I better get back to work. I have to get going too. Go outside? I can't.

826
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:43,219
It won't let me. It's too cold apparently. Carrying this laundry bag around is a pain. I need to dump

827
02:49:43,219 --> 02:49:48,899
it down. Why do I have the laundry bag at 10 o'clock at night? Who told me to pick this up?

828
02:49:48,899 --> 02:50:15,260
If I go outside now, I'll freeze. I can't do anything. Go to bed? I don't think I can go to bed.

829
02:50:15,260 --> 02:50:22,270
I'm just trapped. I can? I was in my room and I couldn't click on my bed.

830
02:50:22,909 --> 02:50:40,209
Get me the hell out of here. Which is, which my room again? I better wait until this do not disturb

831
02:50:40,209 --> 02:50:49,280
sign is gone. I better wait until this do not disturb sign is gone. Where's my room? This is my

832
02:50:49,280 --> 02:51:15,569
bedroom. What just hit me in the head? Why is it, I woke up at one o'clock in the morning?

833
02:51:15,569 --> 02:51:27,020
Now it's 1 p.m. I missed, I missed serving breakfast. Oh god. Just hold on. True though.

834
02:51:27,020 --> 02:51:32,780
How often does that happen? All the time. I gotta, I gotta go to food. As long as it's not time to

835
02:51:32,780 --> 02:51:41,069
cook, I might as well stay out of the kitchen. All right. Now I can finally leave. I'm gonna call

836
02:51:41,069 --> 02:51:57,100
that number. What was it? One, three, three, two, six. I've memorized it by this point.

837
02:51:57,100 --> 02:52:05,600
Ms. Camillo, hi. It's Nancy Drew from Icicle Creek Lodge. Yes. Well, Ollie hasn't succeeded in

838
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:47,250
shooting or trapping it yet, if that's what you mean. It scares me. The wolf scares me.

839
02:52:47,250 --> 02:52:51,649
When I was trapped out on the lake without a coat, it dragged one to the shore and left it there for

840
02:52:51,649 --> 02:53:22,879
me. It may have sensed you were in trouble. It is? Wolves and humans simca dog may mask that reason

841
02:53:22,879 --> 02:53:28,479
no matter how sociable the wolf may appear. Instinct can at any moment rear its ugly head

842
02:53:28,479 --> 02:53:34,399
with devastating results for any humans involved and for the wolf, especially for the wolf. It

843
02:53:34,399 --> 02:53:42,420
will have simply been doing what comes naturally. Don't go up to wild animals like it's a Disney

844
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:53,569
movie. I think we've, I think we could all agree on that. So the fact that this wolf doesn't seem

845
02:53:53,569 --> 02:53:58,129
to be that afraid of people could lead people to think they don't have to be afraid of it.

846
02:54:00,290 --> 02:54:26,540
He's so brave. Oh, shit. I get the picture. I was talking about throwing raw turkeys to it,

847
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:35,579
right? That's my bad. Yeah, I was talking about somehow giving it raw turkeys and stuff, right?

848
02:54:35,579 --> 02:54:43,010
I was like, oh, I'll just throw raw turkey at it. Yeah, that's a good idea, Jeremy. Bad idea.

849
02:54:43,010 --> 02:54:46,450
Are you the one who wrecked all the gear that was in the fishing shack?

850
02:54:46,450 --> 02:55:08,590
Yes, I have to bring the stream warning back. Oh, yeah. Do not attempt anything you see or hear

851
02:55:08,590 --> 02:55:18,819
here. All this is to be never attempted. It's a it's a stream based around comedy and there's

852
02:55:18,819 --> 02:55:24,690
some things that you hear that you do not be said again or to be attempted. I forgot about that.

853
02:55:24,690 --> 02:55:28,049
Yeah, I got to have that like take up the whole entire it's going to be a watermark across the

854
02:55:28,049 --> 02:55:39,620
entire image. When you were here at the lodge, how come you had a magazine that featured

855
02:55:40,579 --> 02:56:14,670
in your room? You know, actually, nevermind. Why didn't you just come out and tell the people

856
02:56:14,670 --> 02:56:41,659
at Icicle Creek Lodge that you were there to protect the wolf? I didn't even ask. I need to

857
02:56:41,659 --> 02:56:59,629
get back to work. I'm getting back to work. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

858
02:56:59,629 --> 02:57:19,120
Please check the number and dial again. Recording. Now I can take the test. He's saying hi,

859
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:38,370
it's Nancy Drew. I'm glad you called. Actually, it was more like Ollie threw her out. Well,

860
02:57:38,370 --> 02:57:48,860
hold on. Hold on a second. We just spoke and what I can I can just accuse. I can just accuse

861
02:57:48,860 --> 02:58:07,139
automatically. Now call Tino. Bad friend. Yeah, we just became really good friends. I can now.

862
02:58:08,290 --> 02:58:21,180
Yeah, but don't betray. Don't betray. I don't think so. We don't know the only we still have

863
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:50,379
to come up with proof. And now that's it for now. Now we call Tino. She gets us the survey.

864
02:58:50,379 --> 02:59:07,649
I think that'll do it. Nevermind. All right. Now what the hell do I do? What do I do now?

865
02:59:07,649 --> 02:59:18,819
You have to go back to Avalanche Ridge to trigger her recognizing she needs the shoes.

866
02:59:18,819 --> 02:59:25,309
Didn't I already do that? I already did that. Yeah. She was like, oh, I can't go anywhere

867
02:59:25,309 --> 02:59:35,459
further without snowshoes. And I kept walking and she died. Go to Avalanche Creek. You die.

868
02:59:36,100 --> 03:00:05,250
You died. Avalanche Creek, not Ridge. Where's Avalanche Creek? Avalanche Ridge. Okay. Now

869
03:00:06,049 --> 03:00:14,159
the snow so deep I'm sinking to my knees. Okay. If I want to follow those tracks,

870
03:00:14,799 --> 03:00:26,559
gonna need some snowshoes. Turn around. I need snowshoes. If I don't get warm soon.

871
03:00:26,559 --> 03:00:36,219
Oh my God. And now I'm gonna die. I don't have any more hand warmers.

872
03:00:42,940 --> 03:01:10,829
I feel warmer already. All right. Now where do I get the snowshoes? You. Now call. I need snowshoes.

873
03:01:10,829 --> 03:01:21,059
Where do I get them? It's Nancy. Listen, I think I'm on to something, but I desperately need

874
03:01:21,059 --> 03:01:25,219
snowshoes. Could you give me the combination to the lock on the display case so I could use

875
03:01:25,219 --> 03:01:54,540
the ones in there? Sure. What do you want me to do? I can't believe it. I'm just gonna write

876
03:01:54,540 --> 03:02:07,459
random information. Sounds good. Excellent. As we speak. Great. I just hope the questions aren't

877
03:02:07,459 --> 03:02:28,670
too dumb. Got it. Good. Okay. Nothing else to report. Don't let me down. Which side of the bed

878
03:02:29,309 --> 03:03:18,620
does S get up from? Yeah, Pluto. Didn't answer. Actually, I was supposed to spill coffee on this

879
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:57,120
one. Neptune. This is two states. I don't know. The right side? What side of the bed? Left? I

880
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:05,200
don't know. And then left? All right. It's filled out. Done. That was fun. Backs it over. I can't

881
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:09,520
send this yet. First, I have to call Tino and tell him to turn his machine on. Turn your machine

882
03:04:09,520 --> 03:05:04,940
on. I sure am. Huh? You bet. I better go. God damn it. I have to go interview people now.

883
03:05:04,940 --> 03:05:36,020
Speedrun. They're not even here. Who do I need? I need to, okay. G, C, L, T, B, K, and Y, V.

884
03:05:36,020 --> 03:05:50,799
Let's go talk to Bill down here, right? Before I forget, Chantal called. Told me I can answer any

885
03:05:50,799 --> 03:05:55,569
questions you might have about those accidents after all. Guess she changed her mind. Okay.

886
03:05:55,569 --> 03:05:59,889
How do you explain what happened to Carl Jenkins, the former guest who slipped on the stairs and

887
03:05:59,889 --> 03:06:05,250
broke his leg? Can't explain it. One minute those stairs were clear and dry. Next minute they're

888
03:06:05,250 --> 03:06:15,680
slick with ass and he's lying at the bottom of them. What's going on with my game? Okay. You're

889
03:06:15,680 --> 03:06:20,479
positive they were clear and dry? Yep. Chipped every bit of frozen snow off of them. Oh, they

890
03:06:20,479 --> 03:06:23,600
have the answers in the chat right now. You ask me. Fuck it. I don't care. Somebody ice those stairs

891
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:29,840
down on purpose because it wasn't nothing I did. No, sir. No, sir. I'll get out of your hair now.

892
03:06:30,079 --> 03:06:33,840
By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned,

893
03:06:33,840 --> 03:06:39,120
so I put it back up at the front desk. He's cheating. Yeah, but this mission is literally,

894
03:06:39,120 --> 03:06:43,440
I just have to talk to people and get their answers. We can write, I already know them.

895
03:06:43,440 --> 03:07:15,920
What is this? Do I have to spell the whole thing out? It's that, right? I don't care. I genuinely do

896
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:19,040
not. I don't care. I know people are saying, oh my God, what? I can't believe you're cheating

897
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:24,459
right now. This is, this is going to take us like an hour. This is like a gigantic fetch quest. I

898
03:07:24,459 --> 03:07:33,809
don't care. I'll copy somebody's paper. This is the kind of stuff I don't, you know, this is,

899
03:07:33,809 --> 03:07:39,139
I don't need to do this detective work. We already got detectives here. What planet was this one?

900
03:07:39,139 --> 03:07:59,920
Just search the rooms. I just, I just pretend I did. I'm disappointed. I, I, I'm telling you,

901
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:10,299
you're not. I know you're not. You're not disappointed. I know you're not disappointed.

902
03:08:10,299 --> 03:08:14,290
You cheated not only the game, but yourself. I know. That's fine. You can, don't spam that

903
03:08:14,290 --> 03:08:19,780
for at least a minute though, cause I can read. Why are you even playing this game? This is the

904
03:08:19,780 --> 03:08:32,020
only time I've done this. This is the one time I decided to do this. You're letting down the

905
03:08:32,020 --> 03:08:37,729
Drew crew. The Drew crew. I, I'm just, I mean, I'm just saying that we have revitalized the

906
03:08:37,729 --> 03:08:41,329
Drew crew the last couple of days. Yeah. There's no way it's disappointing. All right. Let me get

907
03:08:41,329 --> 03:09:23,040
this right. All right. So that is earth. Wait, what earth? No. Okay. Lou is Venus. Okay. Yes.

908
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:38,260
Okay. Okay. Wolf. Yes. How many people is that? That's probably people mad at me.

909
03:09:38,819 --> 03:10:06,370
It's all right. Okay. Okay. No. Okay. What is this one? That? Okay. I didn't get any of these

910
03:10:06,370 --> 03:10:31,139
right even accidentally. Hey, look at that. I did it. All right. Yeah. Let's fax that over.

911
03:10:31,139 --> 03:11:21,979
Turn yours on. I sure did. You messed it up. Oh my God. What was wrong with it? Oh, wrong club.

912
03:11:22,620 --> 03:11:39,090
X. I know. Do it over. Not in Venus. So somebody was lying to me in the chat. Planet X. You know

913
03:11:39,090 --> 03:11:48,059
how painful that would have been. All of us know that we want to avoid me opening the same three

914
03:11:48,059 --> 03:11:56,299
doors 10 times over the course of 40 minutes. Right? I mean, I'm just telling you. Yep. Just

915
03:11:56,299 --> 03:12:26,290
saving us a little time. No problem. I think that'll do it. That's both right. Right. Is it

916
03:12:26,290 --> 03:12:45,059
because I like have, is it capital and don't do capital letters? Maybe Angeles earth earth

917
03:12:48,959 --> 03:13:03,790
isn't random. I spell it wrong. It's Planet X. You're doing the shitty lying voice. No, I swear.

918
03:13:03,790 --> 03:13:18,239
I promise you. I'm looking at a screenshot right now. Is this correct? This is wrong. Spelling,

919
03:13:18,239 --> 03:14:02,579
spelling, spelling. You have to say Planet X. Like that. Planet X. Yeah. Let's try that. Yep.

920
03:14:02,579 --> 03:14:13,090
Okay. Come on, man. What the hell? But Bill Kessler likes to ice fish. Guadalupe Camillo is the one

921
03:14:13,090 --> 03:14:18,610
who likes to bird watch. Yanni Valksdaya is a champion skier and Lou Talbot likes to snowshoe.

922
03:14:18,610 --> 03:14:28,739
That's right. But you were kind of right. I mean, you did pretty much describe everyone at the lodge.

923
03:14:39,229 --> 03:15:00,930
There we go. Finally. Finally. Yes. To the display case. What is it? So what is the point

924
03:15:00,930 --> 03:15:07,090
of that paper with the seven and the four? What was that even for the mirror? That does it for now.

925
03:15:07,090 --> 03:15:32,379
I mean, these damn things did it. I did that number already, but I had to do all that bullshit

926
03:15:32,379 --> 03:15:37,440
first. Okay. I got the snowshoes. Now we're going back out of the ridge. I'm going to walk on the

927
03:15:37,440 --> 03:16:24,940
ice. I'm going to go get a, let me get the hand warmer. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now I have to

928
03:16:24,940 --> 03:16:55,629
go not that way. Not that way. Not that way. This way. Snowshoes. See what's really going on here.

929
03:16:55,629 --> 03:17:18,079
Now what's really going on? What happened to my snow thing? I just took it. Are you kidding me?

930
03:17:18,079 --> 03:17:41,940
I just guess I saw off lock myself. What's going on? I'm starting to get really cold.

931
03:17:41,940 --> 03:17:49,329
I can't stop shivering. I need to get in out of the cold. Looks like some kind of house.

932
03:17:49,329 --> 03:17:56,450
Could someone be living? Hello. Is anyone here? Fuck. Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, no.

933
03:17:56,450 --> 03:18:11,100
This is it. What is it? This is definitely it. It's what was it? Mirrored seven nine. All right.

934
03:18:11,100 --> 03:18:24,530
We're in a weird book. The rest of my life by Julius McQuade. I'm not reading all this.

935
03:18:24,530 --> 03:18:34,159
I'm not reading all this. No way. I don't know. It's too long. So once I get her attention by

936
03:18:34,159 --> 03:18:50,239
saying her name, I can give her commands. I got to pick this up. Maybe I'll write in it.

937
03:18:50,239 --> 03:18:55,760
Okay. Now I miss somebody. I feel like I'm hiking around. I have to write to somebody,

938
03:18:55,760 --> 03:19:01,500
even it's my cell phone. Maybe probably not. I'm tired of writing these down. Tired of feeling

939
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:07,389
caged like an animal. I spent 40 years of working with three hours. The train will reach

940
03:19:07,389 --> 03:19:12,190
Edmonton. Maybe I'll get off. Maybe I won't. I don't know. The next day I woke up in my tent

941
03:19:12,190 --> 03:19:18,139
to the sound of distant gunshots this morning. Later I found my wolf pup is all by herself.

942
03:19:18,139 --> 03:19:25,979
Stuck in a lunch. I figured out the hunting got him and mother since she was nowhere else around.

943
03:19:25,979 --> 03:19:33,659
And since there is no way whatever extra extricate herself, I started shopping through the brambles

944
03:19:33,659 --> 03:19:39,940
to free her. It took me a while though. And I was talking to her all the time, trying to keep her

945
03:19:39,940 --> 03:19:45,540
from struggling and hurting herself. So what I was really doing without meaning to was

946
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:52,639
imprinting my voice and my scent on her brain. Because at first she went racing off, but then

947
03:19:52,639 --> 03:19:56,799
later I noticed that she was following me. Even now she's sitting about 20 yards away,

948
03:19:56,799 --> 03:20:03,180
despite my campfire. Just watching me. I haven't fed her. I avoided touching her while I was cutting

949
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:08,020
her free from the brambles, yet she's there. So since this could be the beginning of an

950
03:20:08,020 --> 03:20:14,739
inter-sting relationship, I thought maybe I should take some notes. Old habits of one indeed,

951
03:20:14,739 --> 03:20:20,590
whatever. A week went by. The pup whose coat is pure white still shadows me wherever I go.

952
03:20:20,590 --> 03:20:25,489
Every day she narrows the distance between us, which has been reduced to about 20 feet. If I

953
03:20:25,489 --> 03:20:30,459
get any closer she runs. Another like month went by. The pup which has been, I've been calling,

954
03:20:32,219 --> 03:20:37,659
now keeps no less than seven feet between us at all times. Distance which I am happy as well. I've

955
03:20:37,659 --> 03:20:42,620
watched her hunt for food, have seen what she can do with her teeth and jaws, and have no desire

956
03:20:42,620 --> 03:20:48,700
to even encounter either on a personal basis. I have revisited the urge to feed her, to make her

957
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:53,819
in any way dependent on me, but I do talk to her. I can't help myself. I've discovered that talking

958
03:20:53,819 --> 03:21:02,159
in a very basic human need, way, why, is a first listens and I don't know, but then she's something

959
03:21:02,159 --> 03:21:11,170
happens. A month went by. Snow has began to fall. I've moved into an alarming dome storage,

960
03:21:11,170 --> 03:21:16,979
but I found it's a little too close, but I don't care. All right, so the dog had a friend.

961
03:21:22,049 --> 03:21:26,209
Hey, are there any plumbers in chat? I took apart my shower head and now I'm confused.

962
03:21:26,209 --> 03:21:31,010
I've been there before and it sucks. I've actually been there before and it kind of sucks,

963
03:21:31,010 --> 03:21:41,520
trying to figure out what to do with it. Yeah, I've been there. I've been there, man. It sucks.

964
03:21:41,969 --> 03:21:45,170
Just, I don't know, at this point, just turn off, turn the water off and just call somebody

965
03:21:45,170 --> 03:21:52,670
that knows what they're doing. That's what I do. Like it or not, I've become hers. I'm not at all

966
03:21:53,389 --> 03:22:00,670
sure which, while she is never underfoot, referring to remain at least three feet away from me most

967
03:22:00,670 --> 03:22:06,020
of the time, she does permit and occasionally seeks out a friendly pat or two on the head and

968
03:22:07,229 --> 03:22:12,559
shoulders. Although like most dogs, she doesn't seem to consider my touch to be any kind of reward.

969
03:22:12,559 --> 03:22:20,079
In fact, I sometimes feel that by letting me pet her, she's rewarding me. Like three months,

970
03:22:20,079 --> 03:22:27,979
four months have gone by. With the coming of the spring, I fully expect Isis to take off one day

971
03:22:27,979 --> 03:22:36,500
and never return, but so far that hasn't happened. She appears for hours at a time. No doubt to hunt,

972
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:41,309
but for some reason she always returns. Another month. Last night, a wolf started howling in the

973
03:22:41,309 --> 03:22:49,409
distance. Isis sat bolt upright, jolted, and listened to my hand she was shaking when howling

974
03:22:49,409 --> 03:22:54,290
ended. After a moment, she lay back down and went back to sleep. I suddenly realized that she's not

975
03:22:54,290 --> 03:23:04,059
going to leave. Even it was either the wilderness or me and incredibly she chose me. This is like

976
03:23:04,059 --> 03:23:10,979
another year. Isis is by far the smartest animal I have ever seen by watching her carefully and

977
03:23:10,979 --> 03:23:23,469
reinforcing the commands. I could have just turned to this page and said that I can give

978
03:23:23,469 --> 03:23:35,489
commands. Down, forward, jump, stay, bark, paw, left, right, around. I can give Isis not just

979
03:23:35,489 --> 03:23:40,530
one command, but many commands chained in a row and she'll carry them out one by one in order.

980
03:23:40,530 --> 03:23:46,540
I start with a chain of commands by saying Isis and I end the chain by saying go.

981
03:23:47,809 --> 03:23:52,989
Ability to sort objects by scent. There's nobody reading this. She has an object in her mouth,

982
03:23:52,989 --> 03:23:58,510
she'll sniff, then drop the object near another object that has the same scent.

983
03:23:58,510 --> 03:24:15,299
Pinevale Hospital. Okay. Uh oh. Sit, sit, sit, stay. Where's the turkey? Where's my raw turkey?

984
03:24:15,299 --> 03:24:35,979
Isis, stay. Okay. Isis, jump. Jump, paw, left, right, jump, down. I'm going to stop here.

985
03:24:36,829 --> 03:24:42,590
Isis, jump, paw, left, right, jump, down, go.

986
03:24:58,639 --> 03:25:08,989
Jump, jump, down, down, left, right. I'm going to stop here. I can't do the Konami code.

987
03:25:08,989 --> 03:25:19,819
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. I'm going to stop. Isis, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,

988
03:25:19,899 --> 03:25:42,930
go. Wow. Bark, bark, bark, bark. I'm going to Isis, bark, bark, bark, bark, around, around, go.

989
03:25:47,459 --> 03:25:56,799
So stupid. Why are we doing this? I mean, this is a really smart, intelligent dog. It seems like a

990
03:25:56,799 --> 03:26:07,469
really great animal, but like, what, why am I, am I going to go out this way or what? Forward,

991
03:26:08,030 --> 03:26:23,489
Isis, forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, go. Okay. So now how about, okay. So left, left,

992
03:26:23,489 --> 03:26:39,149
left out the door. Okay. So left, left, left again, left, and then forward, forward and then

993
03:26:39,149 --> 03:26:46,750
down, down. Like, what does that do? Isis, left, left, forward, down, go. Who's left? My left?

994
03:26:46,750 --> 03:26:55,260
No, that's, that's okay. That's Isis's left. So right. So you need to go right, forward, down,

995
03:26:56,059 --> 03:27:11,600
bark. Okay. So I think I want her to go out here, right? Get rid of this. Right, forward, down.

996
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:32,690
What does that do? Isis, right, forward, down, go. Right, forward, down. Wonder what this is.

997
03:27:32,690 --> 03:27:44,290
Looks like there's a phone number on it. Call it. This is just practice. Oh, what's that?

998
03:27:44,290 --> 03:27:48,770
This indentation looks just like the one on that plaque in the lodge where that missing Rex

999
03:27:48,770 --> 03:27:59,409
bone used to be. A little bro distracted by Bop It. Okay. Well, that's, I guess that's how it is.

1000
03:27:59,409 --> 03:28:07,229
If I try to walk back to the lodge now, I'll freeze. I better stay here for the night.

1001
03:28:07,229 --> 03:28:11,389
Nancy, you forgot about breakfast. You forgot about lunch. I have customers.

1002
03:28:11,389 --> 03:28:42,540
That it? I think that's it. Let's go back. Thanks for being a good dog. Another explosion.

1003
03:28:42,540 --> 03:28:57,280
What the hell is going on out here? It wasn't the dog. The dog was with me. The dog was with

1004
03:28:57,280 --> 03:29:09,170
me the whole time. Do vertebrae employ this furniture to provide wings for muscle attach

1005
03:29:09,170 --> 03:29:19,180
missing otherwise in excellent condition. Big money. Possible urgent sleutlinosis of a new

1006
03:29:19,180 --> 03:29:32,670
species. This thing is important. Owner clueless. Says, says came with lodge probably excavated by

1007
03:29:32,670 --> 03:29:40,510
builder aka rapper Dan. Which search of immediate vicinity private property yielded possible

1008
03:29:40,510 --> 03:29:48,260
sauropod scapula take to lab for precise ID. Must figure out how to look for and excavate

1009
03:29:48,260 --> 03:30:01,200
other species in secret potential gold mine. These are just Trump tweets. Order clueless.

1010
03:30:01,200 --> 03:30:28,670
Okay. Well, so that's the bone. It's okay, Jerma. I get it. So, all right, let's go get that thing.

1011
03:30:28,670 --> 03:30:55,280
Wait, I got turned around. Which one am I going? Wait, yeah, I'm going the right way. Am I going

1012
03:30:55,280 --> 03:31:16,479
the right way? Yeah, okay. We're gonna check out that bone. Ah, much better. Who's this from?

1013
03:31:16,479 --> 03:31:22,899
Uh oh. Meet me in the sauna in the basement. I have some interesting information for you.

1014
03:31:22,899 --> 03:31:27,139
Well, I- Sauna sounds good to me. I'm not getting locked in the sauna. That's not gonna happen.

1015
03:31:27,139 --> 03:31:34,930
That's what's gonna happen. So let's prepare. Where's that? There's like a, where is it? There

1016
03:31:34,930 --> 03:31:52,000
it is. I need to, this is like worth a lot of money. I gotta pick this up. There's no way I don't

1017
03:31:52,000 --> 03:32:09,809
get- I'm gonna get closed in the sauna. Okay. Who is it? Hello? Anybody here? I'm gonna go in.

1018
03:32:09,809 --> 03:32:17,629
These weren't here before. That birthmark below his eye looks very familiar. Wait a minute.

1019
03:32:20,420 --> 03:32:30,659
Oh, somebody locked me in. Is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot.

1020
03:32:31,459 --> 03:32:54,590
Well, we're dead. I can just get cold water running through these pipes. I'll be okay.

1021
03:32:54,590 --> 03:33:10,059
I don't get these pipes adjusted soon. I'm not gonna make it. Hold on. Not much time. I've gotta

1022
03:33:10,059 --> 03:33:17,860
get these pipes lined up now. What's the right? I don't get it. What's, where's it coming from?

1023
03:33:18,659 --> 03:33:30,979
Where's the water coming from? Is someone out there? This is really great. Finding of Isaac

1024
03:33:30,979 --> 03:33:41,729
music. I'm getting really, really hot. Okay. All right. So what the hell's going on here?

1025
03:33:42,450 --> 03:33:59,219
Do I have to connect everything? I can't take this heat much longer. Oh, that's impossible.

1026
03:33:59,860 --> 03:34:10,559
I don't get these pipes adjusted soon. I'm not gonna make it. What the fuck are you doing to me?

1027
03:34:10,559 --> 03:34:19,579
I don't have much time. I've gotta get these pipes lined up now. What the hell? This goes so fast.

1028
03:34:19,579 --> 03:34:36,319
Is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot. This is a

1029
03:34:36,319 --> 03:34:58,129
bullshit puzzle. This is a bullshit puzzle. I'm running out of time. I've gotta do something fast.

1030
03:34:58,129 --> 03:35:04,770
Oh, you piece of shit. That's so awful. That's it, right? Go, go, go, go, go. That's gotta be. Why?

1031
03:35:04,770 --> 03:35:07,809
I've gotta get these pipes aligned before it pass out from the heat.

1032
03:35:07,809 --> 03:35:11,729
Every single one has to be connected, the whole thing. I can't just have one space.

1033
03:35:12,690 --> 03:35:16,129
I don't have much time. I've gotta get these pipes lined up now.

1034
03:35:17,170 --> 03:35:24,100
How the fuck am I supposed to do this? I got it. I got it. I got it. Watch, watch, watch, watch.

1035
03:35:24,100 --> 03:35:31,020
I have to make a closed circle with the first part and then go up. This shit is bullshit. This is

1036
03:35:31,020 --> 03:35:37,260
bullshit. Hey, is someone out there? The door's- I'm getting really, really hot.

1037
03:35:38,219 --> 03:35:48,379
No, stop.

1038
03:35:59,809 --> 03:36:02,530
Dude, stop doing that. This sucks.

1039
03:36:09,250 --> 03:36:09,969
Stop it.

1040
03:36:20,190 --> 03:36:21,620
That was horrible.

1041
03:36:29,340 --> 03:36:30,059
Trying to kill you.

1042
03:36:36,770 --> 03:36:40,690
Say, you look kind of bedraggled. Are you all right?

1043
03:36:40,690 --> 03:36:44,290
I'm fine, and I'll be even better after you and I have a little talk.

1044
03:36:47,229 --> 03:36:52,510
Yeah, that's me. When I was a kid, this place was practically my second home.

1045
03:36:52,510 --> 03:36:55,229
My late grandmother, Tilly Wentworth, used to own it.

1046
03:36:56,500 --> 03:37:04,610
Great. Why did you not open the door when I was dying in the sauna, screaming? I think that's

1047
03:37:04,610 --> 03:37:10,370
the first question we ask after we get the police here. You know what I mean? That's the

1048
03:37:10,370 --> 03:37:21,180
number one question. None of this other shit matters. Was she the reason you wrote that

1049
03:37:21,180 --> 03:37:26,059
letter I found crumpled up in your room? About two years ago, just before she died,

1050
03:37:26,059 --> 03:37:31,020
my grandmother sold this place to Albert Mowikwe without telling anyone in her family.

1051
03:37:31,020 --> 03:37:35,340
From what I've heard about Mowikwe, I'm pretty sure he bullied her into selling.

1052
03:37:35,340 --> 03:37:39,899
I think he cheated her, and he cheated us, and that it's high time somebody-

1053
03:37:39,899 --> 03:37:43,819
Taught him a lesson by, say, putting Icicle Creek Lodge out of business?

1054
03:37:44,540 --> 03:37:50,059
I had nothing to do with that explosion, loose window, the food poisoning, the icy stairs,

1055
03:37:50,059 --> 03:37:55,180
none of that stuff. You ask me, it's karma. The Mowikwes are just getting what's coming to them.

1056
03:37:56,459 --> 03:38:00,700
How about another game of Vox and Geese? How about another game of Vox and Geese?

1057
03:38:00,700 --> 03:38:03,500
Now you're talking. Have a seat. Ready? Okay.

1058
03:38:05,709 --> 03:38:09,069
Actually, I changed my mind. I don't want to play right now.

1059
03:38:09,069 --> 03:38:14,879
Okay. So what can I do for you? Since you used to spend so much time

1060
03:38:14,879 --> 03:38:17,760
here, do you know if there's a way to get into Trapper Dan's needle?

1061
03:38:18,319 --> 03:38:22,719
You know that pyramid thing on the table over there by the entrance to the dining room?

1062
03:38:22,719 --> 03:38:28,399
If you fool around with it until nothing but pigs show on the outside, this compartment will open

1063
03:38:28,399 --> 03:38:33,760
up and inside will be this round magnetic thing that used to be Trapper Dan's special master key.

1064
03:38:34,399 --> 03:38:38,079
Just hold it up by the needle and a hidden door will pop open.

1065
03:38:38,079 --> 03:38:43,520
Are you telling me that I did every animal besides pig? I did at least two of them,

1066
03:38:43,520 --> 03:38:49,090
and just said no. But that was the solution. I would have beat the game.

1067
03:38:49,090 --> 03:38:52,370
If it was all pigs, it would have opened and I would have got the key to that tower and I

1068
03:38:52,370 --> 03:39:01,059
would have beat the game four hours ago, five hours ago. Why did he need a special master key?

1069
03:39:01,059 --> 03:39:06,020
Who knows? I mean, let's face it, living all by himself way out here in the wild

1070
03:39:06,020 --> 03:39:11,459
winter after long dark winter, Trapper Dan was probably stark raving bonkers.

1071
03:39:12,340 --> 03:39:16,879
Two days ago. And we wouldn't have all these lovely memories. You know, that's true.

1072
03:39:16,959 --> 03:39:19,840
I better get going. Okie dokie. That's a good point.

1073
03:39:21,709 --> 03:39:28,639
Okay, so let's go do that. Although that would have been kind of funny.

1074
03:39:30,459 --> 03:39:44,770
Okay, all pigs. So what is right before pig is wolf. We have to get these all to be wolf.

1075
03:39:44,770 --> 03:39:49,680
Thankfully, I already did this puzzle a lot of times. I already know what to do.

1076
03:39:53,100 --> 03:40:09,250
Okay, now we go like this. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine.

1077
03:40:10,190 --> 03:40:16,270
That's fine. Okay, thankfully, open it up empty. If there was a special master key in here,

1078
03:40:16,270 --> 03:40:37,389
it's gone now. So what was the point of that? All for nothing? Really? Wake up. He's not in there.

1079
03:40:38,110 --> 03:40:44,190
Huh? Oh, now what? I opened up that pyramid like you told me, but there was nothing inside.

1080
03:40:44,829 --> 03:40:48,430
There wasn't? Oh, well, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

1081
03:40:49,549 --> 03:40:52,750
What? Could that magnetic key thing be somewhere else?

1082
03:40:52,750 --> 03:40:58,909
You know, Grandma Tilly once told me that if you turn the top of the pyramid 45 degrees,

1083
03:40:58,909 --> 03:41:04,430
then fill all the boxes on the outside with one kind of animal, then another kind of animal until

1084
03:41:04,430 --> 03:41:09,790
you do that for all four animals. She said if you do that, you'd find a journal in there written by

1085
03:41:09,790 --> 03:41:16,270
Trapper Dan himself. So just do every animal? Did you ever read it? I was a kid. What would

1086
03:41:16,270 --> 03:41:23,659
I want to read some crazy old coot's journal for? So go there and turn it into an animal and then

1087
03:41:23,659 --> 03:41:48,100
another animal and then another animal. Now, what is this? What does it want me to do? Do I have to

1088
03:41:48,100 --> 03:42:07,409
get it all the rows like this? One, two, okay, hold on. So one row of raccoons, a row of wolf,

1089
03:42:07,409 --> 03:42:17,780
row of pig, and a row of Mises. I think that's what it wants me to do. So to get this correct,

1090
03:42:17,780 --> 03:42:26,639
we need to line this up. So it'll always be. So what is right before wolf? This has to be

1091
03:42:26,879 --> 03:42:36,510
that. What is right before pig? That. And then right before this is raccoon. So if we go like

1092
03:42:36,510 --> 03:42:41,649
that, that's correct. But it has, okay. So that's good. So this, this, don't touch this line. This

1093
03:42:41,649 --> 03:42:59,420
line is, this line's fine. Okay. Pig. Oh, I messed it up. It's all right. Oh shit. You're really going

1094
03:42:59,420 --> 03:43:10,000
to fuck with me here now, aren't you? Okay. You're ignoring chat. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1095
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:13,520
please, please stop, stop, stop. What, what, what, what, what, what am I doing the hard way?

1096
03:43:13,520 --> 03:44:46,909
Just do it. Okay. All right. I'm working on it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck. No. Oh boy.

1097
03:44:46,909 --> 03:45:05,250
Okay. I got to, I messed it up. The whole thing screwed up. Okay. I need to think about this for

1098
03:45:05,250 --> 03:45:21,579
a sec. It moves everything around it. I got to get all these two. Oh, this hurts my head. This

1099
03:45:21,579 --> 03:45:54,959
hurts my head. This hurts my head. You got to start. Okay. So you get corner and here. Oh fuck.

1100
03:45:54,959 --> 03:46:09,040
Oh man. I think you have to start on the corner. All right. Get everything to, what is it?

1101
03:46:09,040 --> 03:46:21,549
Everything has to be, everything has to be raccoon or at least close to it. This should do it.

1102
03:46:21,549 --> 03:46:34,559
This get all these to raccoon. Okay. And then this should do that. I should do this. Close. There it

1103
03:46:34,559 --> 03:46:45,010
is. Yeah. LOL. The D for beta is over. Oh, oh well. Daniel Weissnitz, better known as trapper Dan,

1104
03:46:49,600 --> 03:46:56,979
a hi-he-ho-ho to you for discovering my hidden journal. No doubt you already found my magnetic

1105
03:46:56,979 --> 03:47:03,459
key that unlocks my needle and the rooms. Keep my secrets safe, especially from the Mounties

1106
03:47:03,459 --> 03:47:11,280
and those rascally squirrels, evious varmints. One thing's for certain without an intelligent

1107
03:47:11,280 --> 03:47:16,159
creature that can crawl through small spaces such as my beloved Mary. You won't be able to

1108
03:47:16,159 --> 03:47:22,239
use my vaults. I fixed the vault passageways so you can see if your animal is dumb or smart by

1109
03:47:22,239 --> 03:47:27,680
getting lost in the vaults. Make sure your pet can jump as there are pits in there and has paws

1110
03:47:27,680 --> 03:47:34,079
or hooves to make the move the levers. The first thing you need to do is crack my cipher below

1111
03:47:34,079 --> 03:47:41,069
or just follow the moose, wolf, raccoon, and Mary. Looks like the rest is in some kind of code.

1112
03:47:41,069 --> 03:47:44,989
First thing you need to is to crack my cipher below or just follow the moose, wolf, raccoon,

1113
03:47:44,989 --> 03:48:20,319
and Mary. I think I get it. I don't. What are you saying? What is this? I have to do this?

1114
03:48:20,319 --> 03:48:29,579
More of this? Any combination will work. Can't find Mary? Well, try pulling on that rope above

1115
03:48:29,579 --> 03:48:35,840
the vaults. It'll open a surprise at the end of the hallway on the second floor. Keep it taut.

1116
03:48:35,840 --> 03:48:40,479
Mary always helped me with that one. She got through the maze. You just need three more

1117
03:48:40,479 --> 03:48:51,940
keys to open the keyholes. Oh my goodness gracious. These are the locks on the doors

1118
03:48:51,940 --> 03:49:10,459
that need to match the animal that need to. This thing is made out of stone. What did this shit

1119
03:49:10,459 --> 03:49:33,260
say again? Oh no, this. No, where's this guy's journal? Isn't this it? Where's the journal?

1120
03:49:33,260 --> 03:50:02,940
So the raccoons need to be the pigs. So the pigs need to be in just like the order. So raccoons

1121
03:50:03,500 --> 03:50:21,899
go in these two slots or something. I don't really box in the geese. Is this this blue? All right.

1122
03:50:21,899 --> 03:50:28,879
These are the hotel. Okay. So blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Please remember that for me.

1123
03:50:28,879 --> 03:50:51,600
I have to go do this to the rooms upstairs. Blue. I already forgot it. I already forgot.

1124
03:50:51,600 --> 03:51:29,620
Blue, red, white. Blue, red, white. Blue, red, white. Then green, blue, red. I did it. Now what?

1125
03:51:29,620 --> 03:51:33,700
Oh my goodness. This is one of those games where you can click out of the window accidentally and

1126
03:51:33,700 --> 03:51:43,219
it minimizes and re-changes all your resolutions. Wrong order. All right. Looking straight down

1127
03:51:43,219 --> 03:51:54,399
this way. Left side is blue. Like I'm talking like from me forward. On the left we've got blue.

1128
03:51:57,709 --> 03:52:08,899
Blue, red, white, green, blue, red. So blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Go to the end of the hall.

1129
03:52:08,899 --> 03:52:13,379
Start at the end of the hall. This isn't an emergency. I better not open it. Okay. So we've

1130
03:52:13,379 --> 03:52:36,319
got looking this way. Starting at the fireplace. Blue, blue, red. Okay. Blue. Stop. Oh my God. I

1131
03:52:36,319 --> 03:52:45,860
hate it. I hate this. I wish I could just move. This side is. So this is blue. What was it? Blue,

1132
03:52:45,860 --> 03:53:01,219
white, red, and green. Infinite content omega low. Hold on now. Blue, red, white on the right side.

1133
03:53:01,219 --> 03:53:20,590
Blue, red, white, green, blue, red. Blue, red, white. That's what I was going to say.

1134
03:53:20,590 --> 03:53:31,579
Green. No, close this door. What just happened? Where am I? What am I looking at? Turn back around.

1135
03:53:31,579 --> 03:54:00,909
Green, blue, red. That it? I don't know if that did anything. I'm taking a picture of my fucking

1136
03:54:00,909 --> 03:54:13,139
phone. I don't even care. I'm literally taking a picture of this on my phone. That's it. That's

1137
03:54:13,139 --> 03:54:24,909
what a normal, sane human being would do. We'll just take a picture of this. Here it is. Got it.

1138
03:54:24,909 --> 03:54:42,530
Done. Go. Got it. All right. From the fireplace, we've got on the left side, green, blue, red.

1139
03:54:42,530 --> 03:55:04,700
Stop turning around. On the right side, it is blue. Okay. Next, we've got blue and red. Blue on left

1140
03:55:04,700 --> 03:55:30,100
side. Close that fucking door. Red on this side. The final hallway is red on the left side. White

1141
03:55:30,180 --> 03:55:48,020
on the other side. Done. I got it. What is going on? So this should be white on the left,

1142
03:55:48,020 --> 03:55:58,899
red on the right. It is. The middle should be red on the left, blue on the right. It is.

1143
03:55:58,899 --> 03:56:11,139
Blue on the right. And the final ones should be blue on the left, green on the right. What's going

1144
03:56:11,139 --> 03:56:20,270
on? Yeah, I did it from the fireplace. Looking like from the fireplace. From the fireplace,

1145
03:56:20,270 --> 03:56:27,409
it's green, blue, red on the left, and blue, red, white on the right. I'm looking at it right now.

1146
03:56:27,409 --> 03:56:43,360
What about the fireplace? Check the fireplace. You have to turn the fireplace on. Do I? You need

1147
03:56:43,360 --> 03:56:54,940
to put fire in the fireplace. You did it right. You have to do something else. So, okay. Okay.

1148
03:56:54,940 --> 03:57:08,430
I keep mistaking this for the... Okay. You use my vault. Make sure you... Okay. Make sure you have a

1149
03:57:08,430 --> 03:57:29,020
dog. Right. Okay. Three keys. I did that. So now that's done. Throw all the books into the fireplace.

1150
03:57:29,020 --> 03:57:47,010
They're pretty useless anyways. So now, the raccoon? With this? Is everybody else as lost as I am?

1151
03:57:47,569 --> 03:58:36,450
Okay. As for the rooms, well, you'll just have to bust down the doors and remake the key.

1152
03:58:36,450 --> 03:58:43,059
Crack my cipher below. Can I just crack this code? I kind of want to hold this up too.

1153
03:58:43,059 --> 03:58:52,750
Because I have, like, the translator app. Like, take it or something. You know what I mean?

1154
03:58:52,750 --> 03:59:02,540
Yeah, what's this code? Cipher this code. I don't... I don't know what this is trying to tell me,

1155
03:59:02,540 --> 03:59:07,840
though. Like, very obviously this is that pyramid. And they're talking about this is where the raccoon

1156
03:59:07,840 --> 03:59:14,370
was placed. So the left side, most left side on the left was a raccoon image. It's telling me to

1157
03:59:14,370 --> 03:59:29,659
do whatever this is. And it wants me to spin it around. Go play the game of geese and fox.

1158
03:59:29,659 --> 03:59:40,299
Did I already do that, though? Do I actually have to play that with this guy? Hello again. I'd better

1159
03:59:40,299 --> 03:59:48,379
get going. Okey dokey. What's up? I'll catch you later. Can't do it. Hello again. I'll see you two

1160
03:59:48,379 --> 03:59:53,979
later, okay? See you later. Any combination will work. What's up? Oh my god. Nice talking to you.

1161
03:59:53,979 --> 03:59:57,420
I just wish there was a different button I could press to, like, leave instead of having to go to,

1162
03:59:57,420 --> 04:00:18,620
like, this magic five pixel area at the bottom of the screen. Yeah, what... what is this even

1163
04:00:18,620 --> 04:00:28,930
talking about? My vaults? There's, like, a whole underground world we haven't been to. It's a maze

1164
04:00:28,930 --> 04:00:54,399
underground, apparently. Do I have to go back to where that needle is and just go... just go there?

1165
04:00:54,399 --> 04:01:04,700
Those are the pyramid clues. Any combination will work, but I don't... it's a raccoon. But I don't

1166
04:01:04,700 --> 04:01:10,370
like spinning around with a weird fucking line in the middle. What does this even mean? If you wanted

1167
04:01:10,370 --> 04:01:13,649
me to spin it around, why would you draw a line in the middle? Is this a letter? What is this?

1168
04:01:18,819 --> 04:01:27,280
And then I thought this was a lobster until I realized it was the moose. So but where do you...

1169
04:01:27,280 --> 04:01:44,290
why is there... and there's, like, a slice of pizza here. Is this a pig? This is a pig. So this is a

1170
04:01:44,290 --> 04:02:00,959
pig's face here. What's this? What's the... hold on. Let me look at this pyramid again. There ain't

1171
04:02:00,959 --> 04:02:17,629
any geese! There's no goose! There's no ducks! Why am I secret hideout? Fox and geese, there is

1172
04:02:17,629 --> 04:02:23,969
a pig, moose, raccoon, and a wolf design on the fox and geese game table. Well, I would love these

1173
04:02:23,969 --> 04:02:44,110
assholes to get the fuck up from the table so I can look at the stupid thing. I can't look at it.

1174
04:02:46,909 --> 04:02:54,930
This needs to be lunchtime, but I can't sit here. Apologize to them. No! I'm not going to.

1175
04:02:54,930 --> 04:02:58,899
I'm just gonna go. I'm just going to bed. I'm just going up there. I'm gonna hit the button

1176
04:02:58,899 --> 04:03:24,139
fucking 10 times in a row. Wait, something on the bed. That's not... get out of my fucking way.

1177
04:03:24,139 --> 04:03:45,010
I have to walk up here and turn around. I want to look at the table! All right, I'm getting

1178
04:03:45,010 --> 04:04:08,659
tantrum-y here. Take the... someone's telling me how to do the code. Take the first line. Take...

1179
04:04:08,659 --> 04:04:17,229
okay, hold on. Take the first letter of the first line, then the first letter of the second line.

1180
04:04:17,309 --> 04:04:28,059
The second letter of the first line, then the second letter of the second line. What? The first

1181
04:04:28,059 --> 04:04:40,530
letter of the first line, and then that's first. So it's first things first. Dude, you have to

1182
04:04:40,530 --> 04:04:54,979
write this out. I have to actually write this down on a piece of paper. Hold on. First... oh,

1183
04:04:54,979 --> 04:04:59,620
somebody has it. First things first. Locate my secret hideout up in the mountains. It's so secret

1184
04:04:59,620 --> 04:05:04,260
you'll probably never find it. But if you do, find my Rex bone and use it in the wall of my

1185
04:05:04,260 --> 04:05:10,100
hideout. That'll open up a secret lock. You could have just said that in three words. Dan,

1186
04:05:10,100 --> 04:05:19,889
whatever your name is. My secret hideout up in the mountains. Find my Rex bone. That didn't help at

1187
04:05:19,889 --> 04:05:32,159
all. Find my Rex bone? Wasn't it telling me that this shit was made out of, like, Rex bones?

1188
04:05:42,620 --> 04:05:56,510
This thing right here. Yeah, so what the hell? Go back to where you met Isis.

1189
04:06:00,540 --> 04:06:30,739
I have to go back to fucking bed, first of all. Okay. I feel like this game has gotten very,

1190
04:06:30,739 --> 04:06:35,299
like, convoluted in the end. Go to my magical pyramid and press the button on the top and then

1191
04:06:35,299 --> 04:06:39,700
do a bunch of weird shit. And by the way, decipher my thesis code. If you can't do that, get a bone

1192
04:06:39,700 --> 04:06:51,309
and put... I'm trying to find... Where is this bone? You miss serving breakfast? I don't give a shit.

1193
04:06:51,309 --> 04:07:23,540
These people go order takeout for all I care. Why is he so mad? What happened? I'm not mad.

1194
04:07:23,540 --> 04:07:58,639
I'm frustrated. Okay. So now where is this thing? Under here? Maybe I can use Isis and her incredible

1195
04:07:58,639 --> 04:08:03,200
sense of smell to figure out who owns the notebook I found outside. I already know who's it is. All

1196
04:08:03,200 --> 04:08:07,520
I have to do is get something from each of the people at the lodge. Something that each of them

1197
04:08:07,520 --> 04:08:12,879
has touched. Then let Isis figure out which of their scents matches the scent on the notebook.

1198
04:08:13,520 --> 04:08:32,420
What? I don't even know what that means. Forward. Isis. Forward. Go. And smell this.

1199
04:08:32,420 --> 04:09:03,860
How do I get the dog to smell this? You do not have to hand it. Okay. You use a guide book.

1200
04:09:03,860 --> 04:09:20,020
This shit's empty. It's empty. I can't get it. We have a Vinny raid coming in right now. Vinny,

1201
04:09:20,020 --> 04:09:24,899
I'm having trouble. I'm having trouble. I need help from the Vinesauce community if you can help us.

1202
04:09:24,899 --> 04:09:33,409
Trying to figure out playing Nancy Drew right now and I'm stuck. Thanks for the raid. Welcome.

1203
04:09:35,780 --> 04:09:41,090
Having a little bit of trouble in the game. Somebody says there's a couple of key things

1204
04:09:41,090 --> 04:09:43,250
you need to find if you actually want to progress. What you need to look for is some

1205
04:09:43,250 --> 04:09:47,409
good old-fashioned values. It's a family guy routine that they're doing a family guy joke.

1206
04:09:47,409 --> 04:09:54,340
I read the rest of it. I'm not going to read the rest. Translate the rest of the words.

1207
04:10:07,940 --> 04:10:12,739
That looks like a Geiger counter. What? What a weird. This measures radioactivity.

1208
04:10:12,739 --> 04:10:22,219
I wonder if Isis found it outside somewhere or in here. Radioactivity. There's a number I could

1209
04:10:22,219 --> 04:10:41,459
call on this weird thing, right? Okay. I can call that. Um, leave. Right. Right. Isis. Right. Right.

1210
04:10:41,459 --> 04:11:00,879
Right. Right. Go. I don't really know what the game wants me to do.

1211
04:11:00,879 --> 04:11:27,020
Smells stuff. But how do you smell this? Bark. Bark. Isis. Bark. Go. Smell this. I don't. I need

1212
04:11:27,020 --> 04:11:33,250
to put the bone here, but I don't have the bone. Somebody stole the bone. I don't know who has the

1213
04:11:33,250 --> 04:11:51,090
bone in their possession. Did they ever expect children to do this stuff? How? Even with an

1214
04:11:51,090 --> 04:11:55,709
adult's help, I would, I would have been like, like son or daughter. Now close that game.

1215
04:11:55,709 --> 04:12:00,049
No, open up, open up fucking Nickelodeon. You know what I mean? Like, get off of this.

1216
04:12:00,049 --> 04:12:24,059
This is too much. Get off of this. Go watch Rugrats. You did choose senior difficulty,

1217
04:12:24,059 --> 04:12:27,899
to be fair. Yeah. Cause if I picked the other difficulty, everyone would have made fun of me.

1218
04:12:27,899 --> 04:12:46,780
Tell the dog to figure it out. I feel like this hole just, can I tell, can you leave?

1219
04:12:46,780 --> 04:12:52,239
Can you leave the hole? Like, this is very clearly saying, Hey, look, there's a space.

1220
04:12:52,319 --> 04:12:55,760
The dog can fit under here. There's no way that's not what this is. No way.

1221
04:13:08,620 --> 04:13:13,790
Very cute, but didn't do anything. Wait, someone's got a solution. Go back to Isis at the shack,

1222
04:13:13,790 --> 04:13:18,930
pass Avalanche Ridge, exit the lodge, go left. I'm at this point. I'm just going to listen to you.

1223
04:13:18,930 --> 04:13:44,989
I'm going to listen to you. Go left, left at the corner of the lodge, left again. So go left,

1224
04:13:44,989 --> 04:13:54,909
the left, left at the corner of the lodge. Wait, what's happening? Go right by the lodge and left

1225
04:13:54,909 --> 04:14:01,899
into the sus space. You're not helping. I already had the shack. Oh, that was the shack. Wait a

1226
04:14:01,899 --> 04:14:11,469
second. I need to, I'm going to uninstall this game. I swear to God, it made me drop. I just

1227
04:14:11,469 --> 04:14:23,700
dropped my chapstick on the ground and I'm pissed about it. Okay. I'm at the lodge. Go left. No,

1228
04:14:23,700 --> 04:14:32,079
I can't go left. Exit the, exit the lodge. I can't even turn around. Okay. Exit the lodge. Go left.

1229
04:14:32,079 --> 04:14:48,719
I'm going to follow this. I don't apply it every 30 minutes. I apply it every hour or 30 minutes.

1230
04:14:48,719 --> 04:15:05,420
Okay. Left, left at the corner of the lodge, left again at the next corner. No, the, no,

1231
04:15:05,420 --> 04:15:10,620
not the shack, the, the, okay. Not the shack, the lodge, the actual lodge where I came from.

1232
04:15:10,620 --> 04:15:16,139
Wait, didn't I already come back here? It's just, it's telling me to go back to where I just was.

1233
04:15:16,139 --> 04:15:28,879
Go back. Yeah. Why wouldn't it go back to ISIS at the shack pass ridge? Exit the lodge, go left.

1234
04:15:28,879 --> 04:15:35,200
Wait, what are you talking about? I just did that. I need to read this. Go left at the corner.

1235
04:15:35,840 --> 04:15:39,760
After the avalanche sign, you use the snowshoes. We already did this. Go forward until the shack.

1236
04:15:39,760 --> 04:15:45,200
Give the notebook with pictures to ISIS. Why? I was just, I didn't read the whole paragraph yet.

1237
04:15:46,079 --> 04:16:05,020
All right. My game is alt tabbed. Warm again. I don't want to say it.

1238
04:16:05,659 --> 04:16:25,860
Give her the notebook with the pictures. I didn't, I try that already. Did that already.

1239
04:16:25,860 --> 04:16:38,430
We did this. It just didn't do anything. It's one of those games where you have to do A, B, C, D, E,

1240
04:16:38,430 --> 04:16:43,629
F, G, even if you have G in your inventory. We just saw it with the stupid survey thing.

1241
04:16:43,629 --> 04:17:26,340
Here's the notebook. Smell that. It doesn't work. I can't even pick this up. I have to talk to

1242
04:17:26,340 --> 04:17:33,889
everyone in the main lodge. I don't even know what anything smells like. Like, what is this?

1243
04:17:33,889 --> 04:17:52,829
Hold on. This is funny. Okay. Somebody asked chat GPD. Great. In Nancy Drew, the white wolf

1244
04:17:52,829 --> 04:17:57,629
Icicle Creek, there's a puzzle that involves snow wolves and triangle puzzles. To solve this puzzle,

1245
04:17:57,629 --> 04:18:01,629
you need to first collect all the triangle pieces scattered throughout the game. Once you have all

1246
04:18:01,629 --> 04:18:05,709
the triangle pieces, go to the room with the wolf display and arrange the triangles to form a wolf

1247
04:18:05,709 --> 04:18:09,950
picture. This will reveal a hidden compartment that contains a snowshoe. Use the snowshoe to

1248
04:18:09,950 --> 04:18:20,059
traverse the snowy area. Well, that's not accurate. That didn't help at all. So we've got to go back

1249
04:18:20,059 --> 04:18:31,329
to the lodge and get things, ask people for stuff that the dog can smell. Why would I do that? Okay.

1250
04:18:31,329 --> 04:18:53,139
This is actually a Wind Waker quest. This is actually driving me crazy. It's going to get dark

1251
04:18:53,139 --> 04:19:12,989
soon and cold. I'm going in. Going in where? I feel warmer already. Let's get Luigi'd. Go to

1252
04:19:12,989 --> 04:19:20,399
the basement. Go to the workbench and get a red rug. Everybody's just telling me the solutions.

1253
04:19:20,399 --> 04:19:36,659
I mean, they're kind of, I mean, come on. Go to the workbench. I'll let you get back to work.

1254
04:19:36,659 --> 04:19:47,549
See you later. How can I help you? I hear that a major cross-country skiing competition may be held

1255
04:19:47,549 --> 04:19:58,719
in this area in a couple of years. This is very true. The towels in the rooms, the laundry.

1256
04:19:58,719 --> 04:20:04,239
I also hear that you can be pretty imaginative when it comes to gaining an edge on your competition.

1257
04:20:04,239 --> 04:20:10,000
I told you about the bomb. My competitors will stop at nothing to defeat me. I am forced to seek out

1258
04:20:10,000 --> 04:20:15,860
and exploit every possible advantage open to me. I take no pride in some of the things I've done

1259
04:20:15,860 --> 04:20:22,219
to bring victory to my country, but I have no choice. I would love to stop clicking out of the

1260
04:20:22,219 --> 04:20:34,180
window. I have disturbed you long enough. We'll talk again, I'm sure. Okay. I need to,

1261
04:20:34,180 --> 04:20:39,299
there's just a certain order to, this is a granny like. I'm conceding that. This is a granny like.

1262
04:20:39,299 --> 04:20:45,569
I didn't think it was, but it is. Everything has to be done in a specific fucking particular order

1263
04:20:45,569 --> 04:20:52,590
or it won't work. It's a granny like. And I'm being chased by my own embarrassment from the chat room.

1264
04:20:52,590 --> 04:20:56,670
That's what's chasing me around these rooms. Laughing at me, pointing at me. You're the granny

1265
04:20:56,670 --> 04:21:04,100
in this situation. It is a granny like. I would love to put the bullet down.

1266
04:21:04,100 --> 04:21:10,260
That's all the questions I had. Good. I would love to put this down, but I have a full,

1267
04:21:11,059 --> 04:21:23,680
full fucking inventory. Oh no, I don't. Relax. Relax. Everything's fine. There's no problem.

1268
04:21:23,680 --> 04:21:35,100
I just keep clicking out of this stupid thing. Please give me the one correct route to go up

1269
04:21:35,100 --> 04:21:44,899
the stairs. Oh my God. Okay. Okay. Cool. I made it out of the basement. Now what?

1270
04:21:45,620 --> 04:21:57,579
He's having a meltdown. It's getting there. Do I have the laundry bag in my gigantic inventory

1271
04:21:57,579 --> 04:22:01,280
of old notes that I didn't even know why I'm keeping any of these? What's the point of me

1272
04:22:01,280 --> 04:22:04,639
holding onto the shit in my inventory? Why do I have this? Throw it in the trash. Throw this away.

1273
04:22:04,639 --> 04:22:08,399
I don't need it. Throw it away. I don't need it. Get rid of it. Throw it in the trash. Where's the

1274
04:22:08,399 --> 04:22:31,309
trash can? Fucking laundry bag. He's losing it. I am. I should have picked, all right. If I haven't

1275
04:22:31,309 --> 04:22:38,829
played a Nancy Drew game ever again, I am picking the, the children, whatever the, the, as whatever

1276
04:22:38,829 --> 04:22:45,709
the, I'm picking like the junior detective mode. I ain't picking the senior detective mode that

1277
04:22:45,709 --> 04:22:50,110
back in like the mid 2000s that was telling you, Hey dude, this is going to be, this is going to

1278
04:22:50,110 --> 04:22:55,739
suck. Don't do that. This is like not even, this is higher than parents difficulty. This is bring

1279
04:22:55,739 --> 04:22:59,100
this to school and give it to your teacher difficulty. This is your teacher's going to look

1280
04:22:59,100 --> 04:23:06,850
at it and go, I don't fucking know what this is. Go sit down. Okay. So we're going to go to bed.

1281
04:23:06,850 --> 04:23:30,559
We're going to wake up at 1 AM. Apparently I got it out. I feel fine. I can't go in. If I unlock

1282
04:23:30,559 --> 04:23:41,969
the door and someone's inside. Yikes. It's why am I waking up at one o'clock in the morning?

1283
04:23:43,170 --> 04:23:48,530
Why is that happening? Can somebody help me here? Why am I waking up at one o'clock in the morning

1284
04:23:48,530 --> 04:24:17,420
every day? They don't need their rooms cleaned anymore. Okay. Take all the laundry. I think I'll

1285
04:24:17,420 --> 04:24:33,569
keep one of these washcloths. Okay. Good. Good. Excellent. Very nice. There we go. Okay. Now let's

1286
04:24:33,569 --> 04:24:53,649
keep going. Excellent. Very cool. Very good. Okay. I've got these. There's one more, right?

1287
04:24:53,649 --> 04:25:05,120
No, that's it. That's it. I've got the three that I need. You're not making the beds. I don't care.

1288
04:25:05,120 --> 04:25:17,229
They're going to fire me anyways. I don't care. This one's already done. All right. So I've got

1289
04:25:17,229 --> 04:25:25,139
these. Now I have to bring this to the dog. I believe these are the only three. Please get out

1290
04:25:25,139 --> 04:25:44,899
of the room. Nancy Drew killed Diablo. Now I missed one. What am I missing? There wasn't one in the

1291
04:25:44,899 --> 04:25:59,329
other room. No, I don't want to give. This is my room, right? It wasn't any in one of these rooms

1292
04:25:59,329 --> 04:26:20,299
though. I need the other. Oh, I need to go to the workbench, right? That's where you get the other

1293
04:26:20,299 --> 04:26:37,729
that dude's rag. You're losing viewers. That's fine. Sorry. It's okay. All right. So now this

1294
04:26:38,370 --> 04:26:42,770
I need to drop this laundry bag down the chute upstairs. No, I don't want to do that.

1295
04:26:42,770 --> 04:26:47,979
How do I put this? Put it away. I don't want to carry dirty laundry around all day.

1296
04:26:47,979 --> 04:27:04,370
I should get rid of this bag. I'm going to kick this door. What? What's going on? I should get

1297
04:27:04,370 --> 04:27:26,100
rid of this laundry bag before I forget. Hi. How do I get his? I need his. What you need.

1298
04:27:26,100 --> 04:27:32,610
I'll let you get back to work. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were

1299
04:27:32,610 --> 04:27:41,340
cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. How do I get his? Go upstairs, enter and go to

1300
04:27:41,340 --> 04:27:49,229
the moose head, right? Click on the moose's eye, take the moose disk with the radio. This is worse

1301
04:27:49,229 --> 04:27:58,829
than a granny like go upstairs to Yanni's room, enter and go to the moose head, right of the door,

1302
04:27:58,829 --> 04:28:02,909
click on the moose's eye, take the moose disk, look at the radio, click on the radio. And there's a

1303
04:28:02,909 --> 04:28:21,700
foreign somebody's talking and then talk to Yanni in the basement about the radio. Jesus. What the

1304
04:28:21,700 --> 04:28:38,270
hell is this thing? It's a third room on a moose head. Oh, give me a fucking break. If something

1305
04:28:38,270 --> 04:28:46,719
tells me this radio belongs to Yanni and if so, why is he hiding it? Click on a moose's head to

1306
04:28:46,719 --> 04:29:21,329
get it a key item. Now go, Hey, what's the radio in your room? Okay. Now let's go talk to you about

1307
04:29:21,329 --> 04:29:28,799
the radio I found in the room. How can I help? Hi. Why do you have a radio hidden away in your room?

1308
04:29:28,799 --> 04:29:34,780
You've got the disk. How do you know about that? When I got done cleaning the moose head, that

1309
04:29:34,780 --> 04:29:41,340
compartment was open. When I looked in it, there was the radio. Now you answer my question. I use

1310
04:29:41,340 --> 04:29:47,100
that radio to communicate with my coaches. It's a special radio. It scrambles the signal so that my

1311
04:29:47,100 --> 04:29:52,219
competitors cannot listen in. How did you know there was a secret compartment in your room?

1312
04:29:52,219 --> 04:29:57,100
The first night I was here, I searched for bugs. Something which, due to the cunning of my

1313
04:29:57,100 --> 04:30:03,340
competitors, I've become very good at. I discovered that by pushing on the moose eye, a compartment

1314
04:30:03,340 --> 04:30:09,100
opened up. What I don't know is, did you really open that compartment by mistake or were you up

1315
04:30:09,100 --> 04:30:16,959
to something else? I'm a detective. I'm a detective. I'm a detective. I'm a detective. Shut up.

1316
04:30:16,959 --> 04:30:22,959
I'm no spy, Mr. Volksteyer. I'm just very observant. Who else have you told about the radio?

1317
04:30:23,520 --> 04:30:30,239
No one. I believe you, Nancy. So if I find out you're lying, both of us will be very sorry.

1318
04:30:30,239 --> 04:30:37,620
Okay. You're busy, so I'll let you go. Hold on, I'll be right back. I gotta get the crime disk

1319
04:30:37,620 --> 04:30:44,719
from out of whatever that was. I'll be back. Hold on, just be right back. I'm going to get the crime

1320
04:30:44,719 --> 04:31:17,409
disk out of your room. All right, now where is it? Did I get it? Okay, got it. All right, now show

1321
04:31:17,409 --> 04:31:37,729
him the crime disk. Okay. Make him take off the wetsuit. How can I help you? Do you have any proof

1322
04:31:37,729 --> 04:31:43,409
that your competitors are out there spying on you? When one has enemies, it's prudent to assume that

1323
04:31:43,409 --> 04:31:50,379
they are always close by. They are here, Nancy. Make no mistake. Okay, can you imagine? We have

1324
04:31:50,379 --> 04:31:58,049
a conversation here. I found this hidden radio up in your room. You did? Oh, well, that was nothing.

1325
04:31:58,049 --> 04:32:02,770
Why were you in my room looking through my things? Well, because I was, I'm a detective.

1326
04:32:02,770 --> 04:32:07,010
I'm trying to find like a killer and who's trying to kill people and shit. Oh, don't do that again.

1327
04:32:07,010 --> 04:32:15,629
Okay. Yeah, I won't. And then I turn around and I fucking sprint fucking stairs and they,

1328
04:32:15,629 --> 04:32:23,840
and he hears above him me running up the other fucking stairs. Are you chasing, am I getting

1329
04:32:23,840 --> 04:32:38,299
chased? You're busy, so I'll let you go. That's how fast I was going. Okay, so now I can take that

1330
04:32:38,299 --> 04:32:45,219
thing. What you need? I'll let you get back to work. If you need anything, just holler.

1331
04:32:46,079 --> 04:33:01,459
Everything's good. We're fine. Okay, so now where do I take that thing? This goes into,

1332
04:33:02,260 --> 04:33:49,259
it goes into a slot. Is it fire? Fireplace? Really? You need to look for the shotgun behind the front

1333
04:33:49,259 --> 04:33:57,409
desk. There'll be a buckshot under the rug. Shut. Come on, man. The fire necklace will tell you all

1334
04:33:57,409 --> 04:34:02,689
you need to open up. Sly raccoons hiding place. Just don't wake up in the, yeah, this is very

1335
04:34:02,689 --> 04:34:09,860
helpful. Don't wake, go back and take a look at the fire necklace at the display table. Take note

1336
04:34:09,860 --> 04:34:14,580
of the colors of the disks. Go back up to the guest rooms. Look close to the colored wedges above

1337
04:34:14,580 --> 04:34:36,049
the doorknobs. Yeah, you're a click. Look at the picture of the raccoon between. Yeah, I would never

1338
04:34:36,049 --> 04:34:41,169
would have clicked on this. I just wouldn't have. I never would have clicked the random painting on

1339
04:34:41,169 --> 04:34:52,860
the wall. I never would have done that. Okay, so where, how do I get the pig one? This is the pig.

1340
04:34:52,860 --> 04:35:08,669
How do I light the fireplace? Go talk to Lou. You know what's so funny about this? There are about

1341
04:35:08,669 --> 04:35:17,810
17,000 people here right now. I bet you at least 12 to 13,000 of you have the guide open on like,

1342
04:35:17,810 --> 04:35:23,360
you have like the game facts open and you're all just sitting there going, how are we going to just,

1343
04:35:23,439 --> 04:35:28,380
how do I make sure he reads this? I think two or three thousand of you just gave up and like are

1344
04:35:28,380 --> 04:35:32,860
making food right now and you can probably hear me from across the room. Maybe you put me on the TV

1345
04:35:32,860 --> 04:35:35,740
and you're like, you know what? I'm, he's not going to finish this in like the next 20 minutes. I'm

1346
04:35:35,740 --> 04:35:39,659
going to make like a steak and I'm probably talking to you right now. You may, hopefully the steak is

1347
04:35:39,659 --> 04:35:44,000
good. Hope you cook it well. Well, not well done, but well enough for you to enjoy it. And then I

1348
04:35:44,000 --> 04:35:48,750
think like a couple thousand of you just left and they were like, I'm going to bed. So for all of

1349
04:35:48,750 --> 04:36:06,479
the 12,000 of you that had the game facts open, I appreciate it. Now we need to talk to Lou. One

1350
04:36:06,479 --> 04:36:10,959
person has it open 12,000 or just copy and pasting the one person's answers and changing

1351
04:36:10,959 --> 04:36:18,860
one word to be sus. That's also true. You're right. A lot of you are not helping at all.

1352
04:36:18,860 --> 04:36:22,939
You're copy and pasting the real answer and then adding like, and then you poo poo all over and

1353
04:36:22,939 --> 04:36:27,419
then you pee pee. And then it's like, okay, well I've read that one. I didn't, but you know,

1354
04:36:27,419 --> 04:36:33,139
I did read it, but I didn't say that I read it until right now. Lou. Yeah. Well, good luck with

1355
04:36:33,139 --> 04:36:48,740
the game. In real moose, the moose, the moose, the moose, the moose. I can't already have the

1356
04:36:48,740 --> 04:36:58,180
moose eye. Why are you telling me to click on the moose? I already have it. How do I talk to Lou?

1357
04:36:58,740 --> 04:37:13,069
Hello again. I'll see you two later. Okay. I haven't served food in three days. What's up?

1358
04:37:13,069 --> 04:37:21,419
Nice talking to you. Ditto dude. I'm going to sneeze and I'm really sorry. Wait, I need to do

1359
04:37:21,419 --> 04:37:56,419
this. Come on. I wanted so badly to get that. If it's back, I'll do it. Damn it. I want to click

1360
04:37:56,419 --> 04:38:05,090
on this one. I can't even click on it. As long as it's not time to cook, I might as well stay out

1361
04:38:05,090 --> 04:38:40,830
of the kitchen. I can't click this one. Um, someone's talking about like element ring strategies.

1362
04:38:40,830 --> 04:38:53,939
Mm hmm. Things are not going well for stripper. German 95 has been having a little trouble in

1363
04:38:53,939 --> 04:39:06,900
Nancy Drew playthrough. I do not have the bone yet. I can't open it. I'm going to call this number

1364
04:39:06,900 --> 04:39:38,619
three, three, four, five, five, five, seven, six, two, five. What is this? My name is Nancy Drew.

1365
04:39:38,619 --> 04:39:45,310
I'm staying at the Icicle Creek Lodge and I recently came across some kind of device that

1366
04:39:45,310 --> 04:39:55,840
had your phone number on it. Well, it has a spike on one end of it. And well, actually this,

1367
04:39:55,840 --> 04:40:02,000
I mean, someone's dog was using it as a chew toy. She must have found it outside somewhere.

1368
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:29,810
You know what it is? What's a geophone? They said it sounds like a frog detective voice.

1369
04:40:29,810 --> 04:41:03,279
OK, so I got to go take the radiation device. When you say seismic waves, are you talking about

1370
04:41:03,279 --> 04:41:29,229
earthquakes? So to put the geophones to use, you need to blow things up. So if someone were

1371
04:41:29,229 --> 04:41:45,099
looking for valuable mineral deposits, they might use geophones to do it. Types of mineral deposits

1372
04:41:45,099 --> 04:42:09,009
are likely to be found around the Icicle Creek drainage. Good word. What do you know about

1373
04:42:09,009 --> 04:42:12,930
dinosaur bones? What do you know about dinosaur bones? That's not the one I wanted to click on.

1374
04:42:12,930 --> 04:42:44,080
Are dinosaur bones good for anything? Delete that part of the stream. Just rewind that and delete

1375
04:42:44,080 --> 04:42:58,110
it. I came across a Geiger counter. What can you tell me about them? How am I able to bring that

1376
04:42:58,110 --> 04:43:54,540
up? Do you know what range of radiation is unsafe? All right. In other words, if I'm doing a high

1377
04:43:54,540 --> 04:43:58,700
reading on my Geiger counter, it doesn't necessarily mean I'm an imminent danger.

1378
04:44:06,939 --> 04:44:44,930
All right. 990. 990 frequency. All right. So that's cool and all. So can I turn the radio station?

1379
04:44:44,930 --> 04:45:11,040
Or this is 990. It's the radio. You sound sad. Yeah. I just wanted to. You don't. I can't. OK,

1380
04:45:11,040 --> 04:45:20,349
turn it to nine. I don't know what this is. There's too many moving parts in this game.

1381
04:45:20,349 --> 04:45:34,220
I have. Should I bring this stuff to get sniffed? Look at all this shit in my inventory.

1382
04:45:34,299 --> 04:46:16,860
How do I get this open? I can't get it open. I need to talk to Lou. Every time I talk to Lou,

1383
04:46:16,860 --> 04:46:24,419
he's sitting at that game and he just goes, talk to you later. A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E,

1384
04:46:24,419 --> 04:46:31,619
E to G, G to X, and then Y and Z. And you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And if you go from 1 to 4,

1385
04:46:31,619 --> 04:47:02,029
what's going on? Somebody's like radiated here. Turn around. What's up? Nice talking to you.

1386
04:47:02,029 --> 04:47:16,430
Ditto, dude. I can't talk to Lou. Lou doesn't do anything. The bear? What about the ram head?

1387
04:47:16,430 --> 04:48:16,220
How do I get it? I need a ladder. I need a ladder. The door colors are wrong. Go check them.

1388
04:48:16,779 --> 04:48:22,080
No, they're not. I wouldn't. I wouldn't really get the raccoon one if that was the case.

1389
04:48:22,080 --> 04:48:40,959
Why is there a radiation mechanic in a Nancy Drew game? Oh, this game is fucked. I need to

1390
04:48:40,959 --> 04:48:50,299
turn the fire on. So I need to somehow get whatever. This is the pig head. I got to get

1391
04:48:50,299 --> 04:48:56,509
the fire to turn on, but I also have to get the ram one too. So I need a stepladder or something.

1392
04:48:56,509 --> 04:49:07,520
Have I not beaten this game yet? I don't know, because the game is fucking goofy. So this is a

1393
04:49:07,520 --> 04:49:28,240
goofy game. This is a wacky game. I could maybe go back and have the dog smell this. That's the

1394
04:49:28,240 --> 04:49:36,419
only thing I can think of right now. Understand anything else. What the hell am I supposed to do?

1395
04:49:36,419 --> 04:50:00,580
Just do that. Why do you pick the hilarious difficulty? I didn't mean to. It was only it

1396
04:50:00,580 --> 04:50:14,479
was this or easy. See what the dog says about this stuff, which I view left of the stream in

1397
04:50:14,479 --> 04:50:19,729
the last 20 minutes. He came back to check on us. The dog talks. That's a kind of bizarre,

1398
04:50:19,729 --> 04:50:23,009
by the way. So you missed that, which is very weird when it started talking.

1399
04:50:23,650 --> 04:50:40,029
I mean, I don't I don't think it should be like an Elmo voice. It was off putting and weird when

1400
04:50:40,029 --> 04:50:47,549
it was like Elmo was like high pitched kind of Elmo voice. I'm surprised I actually decided to

1401
04:50:47,549 --> 04:50:52,110
give it that kind of a voice. All right. What do you think about this? I shouldn't give Isis that.

1402
04:50:52,110 --> 04:51:14,159
I should give her the notebook. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Looks like it's not Yanni's

1403
04:51:14,159 --> 04:51:24,560
negative for Bill Kessler. The sense match, which we got those notes belong to Lou Talbot.

1404
04:51:26,770 --> 04:51:44,799
Good dog. Hey, Lou got a bone to pick with you, Lou.

1405
04:51:47,520 --> 04:52:15,500
Everybody laugh. We just sneaking with our jokes like that. I was going to walk in with the notebook

1406
04:52:15,500 --> 04:52:20,259
in my hand, holding it straight up. He's like a cigarette too. You know what I mean?

1407
04:52:21,860 --> 04:52:29,040
Just walk right in the front door. What's it say in the first passage here? Oh,

1408
04:52:29,040 --> 04:52:34,959
two vertebrae employed as furniture, but your fried wings for muscle attachment.

1409
04:52:37,700 --> 04:52:40,740
It's quite the notebook. Just be talking loudly about it.

1410
04:52:42,720 --> 04:52:51,810
Now where would I be able to find the owner of this notebook? I wonder warm again. Now what?

1411
04:52:51,810 --> 04:53:03,810
What is this? Lou Talbot charged with trespassing, vandalism and theft. I have a plan property,

1412
04:53:03,810 --> 04:53:11,299
creating a piece of earth a texture inspired by maverick artist Poppy Dada of keeping the

1413
04:53:11,299 --> 04:53:31,840
dinosaur bones dug up on the process. Dinosaur bones. Hey Lou, can I get your hand with

1414
04:53:31,840 --> 04:53:44,849
something in the kitchen? Oh, he's gone. Not time for kitchen duty yet. I feel like it hasn't been

1415
04:53:45,569 --> 04:54:05,729
for days. Let me in here. That just hurt my fucking head. I did too many and it hurt.

1416
04:54:07,389 --> 04:54:32,990
Why is that so loud? Okay, so now I call somebody. I mean, I know that I need to talk to Lou,

1417
04:54:32,990 --> 04:55:02,740
but Lou is not here. Do I just have to go to sleep? Can I get that ladder? Thanks for taking the time

1418
04:55:02,740 --> 04:55:14,529
to talk to me. Come back anytime. What you need. I'll let you get back to work. Keep me posted.

1419
04:55:22,000 --> 04:55:27,040
When you make the scavenger hunt too hard, the kids can't do it and you just have to keep telling

1420
04:55:27,040 --> 04:55:34,610
them where things are hidden. I should put on a coat before I go outside. I don't know where the

1421
04:55:34,610 --> 04:55:42,959
egg is. Well, did you go up and press the face of the ox up in the bedroom? No. Well, after that,

1422
04:55:42,959 --> 04:55:49,040
did you take the Geiger counter out of the wall and then find the radiated banana that I put

1423
04:55:49,040 --> 04:55:57,250
under the sink? No. Well, I mean, and then after doing that, did you look down the third drain of

1424
04:55:57,250 --> 04:56:03,380
the fourth toilet in the house? I just want to collect eggs. I don't want to do this. Well,

1425
04:56:03,380 --> 04:56:10,560
you must be a dumb kid then. Let me show you where everything is. And I don't even fucking know.

1426
04:56:10,560 --> 04:56:14,400
All right. It's the banana. I like open up the banana, peel the banana and then there's a code

1427
04:56:14,400 --> 04:56:19,540
written on the peel. No, it's not. The code's not on this banana peel. No, I must have written that

1428
04:56:20,340 --> 04:56:26,189
underneath the desk. I don't, it's not there either. I don't know where your eggs are. They're gone,

1429
04:56:26,189 --> 04:56:32,110
kid. They're fucking out of here. They're gone. I ate all the eggs. I ate all the chocolate in them.

1430
04:56:33,069 --> 04:56:48,459
That's what happened to them. Okay. I need to talk to Lou. I feel warmer already. I'm just going

1431
04:56:48,459 --> 04:57:10,930
to fucking bed. Mr. Green, are you all right? No, I can't get out of here. I'm fine. Stupid Easter

1432
04:57:10,930 --> 04:57:21,229
eggs hunt anyways. When I was younger, we did money hunts. My father put six grand in a brief

1433
04:57:21,229 --> 04:57:25,310
case we hid it and me and all my siblings had to beat the shit out of each other and find it.

1434
04:57:25,950 --> 04:57:31,939
He hid it in one place. He gave us all different clues that were wrong. We had to come together

1435
04:57:31,939 --> 04:57:35,939
and put our pieces of our clues together, but it never worked out that way. We just beat the shit

1436
04:57:35,939 --> 04:57:46,509
out of each other. I don't talk to any of my siblings anymore either. There he is. What's up?

1437
04:57:46,509 --> 04:57:55,279
Can I have the Rex bone that you took from the plaque? Do you think I could have the Rex

1438
04:57:55,279 --> 04:58:01,119
bone that you took from that plaque by the display case? Dude, what makes you think I took some bone

1439
04:58:01,119 --> 04:58:10,020
from some plaque? Don't get smart with me. Because you referred to it in your notebook.

1440
04:58:10,979 --> 04:58:16,740
He's losing it. I'm fine. Someone who has a really good nose for such things is positive that it's

1441
04:58:16,740 --> 04:58:22,020
yours. All right, here's the deal. There's a lot of people out there who collect stuff like fossils

1442
04:58:22,020 --> 04:58:27,700
and dinosaur bones, okay? They pay big bucks for them. And it just so happens paleontology is kind

1443
04:58:27,700 --> 04:58:35,500
of my thing. This guy's drip is atrocious. I disagree because this reminds me of Scott Cyclops's

1444
04:58:35,500 --> 04:58:41,810
drip, which is the blue with the yellow thing that goes across. That's Scott Cyclops's drip.

1445
04:58:41,810 --> 04:58:45,360
I like this. Don't call this bad drip. It's the same outfit.

1446
04:59:09,380 --> 04:59:12,020
You want the bone from that plaque? Go ahead and take it.

1447
04:59:12,740 --> 04:59:18,580
Okay, dude. Excitement's over. Who's move? Okay, dude.

1448
04:59:21,700 --> 04:59:51,569
That's awesome. Okay, dude. All these bones. Lou's been a busy guy. Okay, dude. Here's the one I'm

1449
04:59:51,569 --> 04:59:55,889
looking for. Give me that. The Rex bone that's missing from that plaque. It is. Now let's go do

1450
04:59:55,889 --> 05:00:28,580
it and solve the mystery. Did I call anybody? Crumpled paper under the desk? I think we already

1451
05:00:28,580 --> 05:00:36,860
called that number. I lost my phone. Can you call it for me? Yeah, yeah. Give me a second.

1452
05:00:36,860 --> 05:01:02,349
It's ringing. It's in the room somewhere. I can hear it somewhere in the house. Can you hear it?

1453
05:01:04,130 --> 05:01:10,259
Check under the sofa. Like just look under the bed. Yeah, somewhere in here. I don't know where

1454
05:01:10,259 --> 05:01:44,049
your fucking phone is. You're sitting on it. I'm not sitting on it. I already looked. I still don't

1455
05:01:44,049 --> 05:02:01,580
have the other coins though. If you don't need it. I'm not sitting on it. Do you want me to call it

1456
05:02:01,580 --> 05:02:07,889
again to see if I'll prove I'm not sitting on it? I'm calling you right now. I'm calling it again.

1457
05:02:07,889 --> 05:02:56,220
My service. Hold on a second. My phone's fucked up. All right. It's ringing. I don't know where

1458
05:02:56,220 --> 05:03:07,779
it is. It's not underneath me. Oh shit. It's underneath me. I just set up. What do I do?

1459
05:03:07,779 --> 05:03:21,790
What do you want to do with this? I was sitting on it. Fuck. All right. I gotta. That's weird.

1460
05:03:21,790 --> 05:03:34,400
I was kind of muffled before I picked it up from under my ass. But I don't know. I don't know what

1461
05:03:34,400 --> 05:03:41,069
that was. But, um, that's pretty. I guess we just did that. This one. Oh, that just happened.

1462
05:03:42,740 --> 05:04:01,500
Fucking door. There it is. So I can rearrange these by continuing to drop the tile that falls

1463
05:04:01,500 --> 05:04:06,700
out the bottom into one of the columns at the top. What? The question is, how should I rearrange

1464
05:04:06,700 --> 05:04:14,049
them, match the symbols and line them up in rows of three? Maybe. Oh no. It's the shit again.

1465
05:04:14,049 --> 05:04:30,639
It wants me to do all this weird shit. Can I change the difficulty right now? I gotta put

1466
05:04:30,639 --> 05:06:11,680
all the coins in. Don't I? No. Wait. What is it? Okay. Wait. No. No. Having a tantrum. Um,

1467
05:06:11,680 --> 05:06:20,979
so there's an extra one here. The question is, how do I, I gotta get rid of the extra one.

1468
05:06:20,979 --> 05:06:49,139
Putting it in. Like it's just stupid ass puzzle. I just don't know the order. It's just, I just

1469
05:06:49,139 --> 05:06:54,720
don't know what order I need to do this in. I'm just so over this. I'm just over it. I would

1470
05:06:54,720 --> 05:07:16,590
smash this thing with a fucking hammer until I got it. Well, how many are in this row? The order is

1471
05:07:16,590 --> 05:07:24,130
beside it. I know it's fish owl bunny, but this one stupid ass duck is ruining everything for me.

1472
05:07:24,130 --> 05:07:31,819
Only the answers were in a book. Yeah. I can't, I have to like leave this to open up the book.

1473
05:07:31,819 --> 05:07:38,740
It wants me to do this first and that's all fine and dandy, but how do I get rid of this stupid

1474
05:07:38,740 --> 05:07:53,759
duck? I need to get the fish to be like the next thing coming down like here. How do I get it out

1475
05:07:53,759 --> 05:08:08,479
of order? Like on the bottom row is if I'm going to, I have to start moving shit around. I'm going

1476
05:08:08,479 --> 05:08:14,700
to get all this. It's going to get all messed up because it takes so many coins out. Whatever.

1477
05:08:14,700 --> 05:08:21,740
I'm just going to fuck the whole thing up. I just don't, I don't know how to get to the solution I

1478
05:08:21,740 --> 05:08:46,110
want to get to. Is that it? No, it's not. God damn it. Range two columns at a time. Uh, I'm just,

1479
05:08:46,669 --> 05:08:50,849
I've been playing this dumb ass fucking children's game for five hours. Where am I going with this

1480
05:08:50,849 --> 05:09:03,150
one left? I didn't, I didn't even know you could fucking do that. Are you kidding me? But that

1481
05:09:03,150 --> 05:09:17,599
doesn't help. Crazy how not hard this is. Well, it's not hard when you know exactly how to do it.

1482
05:09:17,599 --> 05:09:22,799
I don't know how to do it. So it's not easy for me. It's hard for me because I don't know what I

1483
05:09:22,799 --> 05:09:44,689
have to do. I mean, I get it, but I'm running into a wall in my brain. That's why puzzles exist.

1484
05:09:44,689 --> 05:09:55,409
All these symbols and shapes and placement. Like I could sprint a hundred miles per hour in five

1485
05:09:55,409 --> 05:10:01,790
seconds. You give me a ball. I could hit that fucking ball hard. I can do anything else with

1486
05:10:01,790 --> 05:10:31,889
this. I need to reset it. The game won't even let me leave. It's like, no, dude, you're here.

1487
05:10:31,889 --> 05:10:41,569
You're, you're stuck here. Yeah. I know what it's supposed to look like. It's supposed to be fish,

1488
05:10:41,569 --> 05:10:50,450
owl, bunny. I'm about to just let you guys do it while I watch fucking SpongeBob on another

1489
05:10:50,450 --> 05:11:16,819
yellow monitor. Let me see if I can get it. Let me try it one more time. So bunny, bunny,

1490
05:11:16,819 --> 05:11:22,180
fish fit. It's just like, it's like knocking shit down. I can rearrange these by continuing to drop

1491
05:11:22,180 --> 05:11:26,259
the tile that falls out the bottom. I hate looking at this. Columns at the top. Then everybody get

1492
05:11:26,259 --> 05:11:31,700
that way. We look at just a shitload of symbols and you just can't anymore. They all just meld

1493
05:11:31,700 --> 05:11:42,529
together into one picture. Like this is all melding into one image. They're all, it's all the same

1494
05:11:42,529 --> 05:11:47,409
picture. It's all literally the same photo. I can't move them around. They're stuck here.

1495
05:11:47,409 --> 05:12:13,650
Maybe Dave can help. I almost feel like I want two coins at the same time, but I can't, I can't get

1496
05:12:13,650 --> 05:12:31,090
that. He's going to end the stream. I'm not going to end the stream. It's like a slight. Yeah. It's

1497
05:12:31,090 --> 05:12:37,340
all the slider puzzle dog shit. All right. Slider puzzles are problems too. I wasn't going to get

1498
05:12:37,340 --> 05:12:46,979
angry today. Slider puzzle. Oh God. No, I can't do a slider puzzle. Oh no. You know, when we were

1499
05:12:47,060 --> 05:12:55,090
younger, we didn't do slider puzzles. We went down the slip and slide off on rocks. Yeah. None of

1500
05:12:55,090 --> 05:13:11,659
this smooth fucking grass bullshit. Let me look at this again. Reset the whole thing. So I can

1501
05:13:11,659 --> 05:13:16,860
rearrange these by continuing to drop the tile that falls out the bottom into one of the columns

1502
05:13:16,860 --> 05:13:22,529
at the top. I know how it works Nancy. How should I rearrange them? Match the symbols and line them

1503
05:13:22,529 --> 05:13:37,580
up in rows of three maybe? Nancy. Hold on. I'm going to click that out of the window. You want

1504
05:13:37,580 --> 05:13:45,169
the bunny on top. Yeah. I, you need the bunny on top. Always keep the animal tokens next to each

1505
05:13:45,169 --> 05:13:56,139
other. That's the theory. Oh, I've got wicked bad diarrhea right now. I'm just, oh, I'm sorry.

1506
05:13:56,139 --> 05:14:13,060
Stomach is like fucking like a wicked bad diarrhea right now. I think it passed. I think I'm all

1507
05:14:13,060 --> 05:14:22,369
right. Yeah. I think I'm good. Get a good look at this. All right. The duck definitely has to go.

1508
05:14:22,369 --> 05:14:31,389
If it were me doing this, I would probably put the duck second row or the first row. I think

1509
05:14:31,389 --> 05:14:34,990
now that can go to the right side because you want to make sure that that's in the middle now

1510
05:14:34,990 --> 05:14:38,979
and then that goes on the left side for me. I would put this in the middle and this is going

1511
05:14:38,979 --> 05:14:44,209
to go up here and then on the left again, I think, and then probably back up. But I would

1512
05:14:44,209 --> 05:14:50,209
say probably on the left side and the left again and then maybe on the right. No, I would say

1513
05:14:50,209 --> 05:15:01,979
probably the middle. I think that's correct. Maybe the right left side and the right side

1514
05:15:01,979 --> 05:15:09,220
and the left side again. The walkthrough is different now. How, how, how, how would you

1515
05:15:09,220 --> 05:15:14,860
fucking do this shit? Look at all this and look at this mess. This is a fucking mess. I'm cheating.

1516
05:15:14,860 --> 05:15:21,200
I don't care. I'm literally cheating right now. I hate these. All these games that have just slider

1517
05:15:21,279 --> 05:15:25,569
puzzle after slider puzzle. I would, I would know just give me anything else besides this.

1518
05:15:25,569 --> 05:15:36,880
I can't even follow the guide. It's happening so fast. I'd rather eat my own hand than do a

1519
05:15:36,880 --> 05:15:55,330
slider puzzle. Okay. This goes here. So I can rearrange these by continuing to drop the

1520
05:15:55,330 --> 05:16:00,130
this is like the worst. This is my least favorite way to play a video game is these kinds of

1521
05:16:00,130 --> 05:16:08,349
puzzles. How should I rearrange the game? Just crashed. Stop fucking with me. Match the symbols

1522
05:16:08,349 --> 05:16:28,189
and line them. And I lost my place in the video slider puzzles. Okay. Goose goes first and that

1523
05:16:28,189 --> 05:16:38,479
goes on the right side that mine is different than the walkthrough. What, what's going on?

1524
05:16:38,479 --> 05:17:00,979
Is it our, is it random? The walkthrough is going too fast. This is not, I put, why did I put this

1525
05:17:00,979 --> 05:17:07,779
on a hard? What was I doing? It's Nancy Drew. Do I really care? The tile that falls out the bottom

1526
05:17:07,779 --> 05:17:14,819
into one of the columns at the top. Question is how should I match the symbols and line them up

1527
05:17:14,819 --> 05:17:21,779
in rows of three? Maybe if I was in bed with my iPad, I wouldn't care. I would be doing this,

1528
05:17:21,779 --> 05:17:36,860
but I'm, we're not in bed. I'm not, we're not in bed. We're not there. That no baited me.

1529
05:17:37,419 --> 05:17:41,889
It actually baited me. This is not supposed to go here. They put the, they hovered over here.

1530
05:17:41,889 --> 05:18:09,569
And it was like, Oh, no. And then they moved. What the fuck? Christ, man. So I can rearrange

1531
05:18:09,569 --> 05:18:14,209
these. I know how it works. Stop talking. That falls out the bottom into one of the columns at

1532
05:18:14,209 --> 05:18:20,349
the top. The question is how should I rearrange them? Match the symbols and line them up in rows

1533
05:18:20,349 --> 05:18:28,750
of three, maybe. I'm going to laugh if this walkthrough takes a wicked long time to do this.

1534
05:18:36,419 --> 05:19:02,220
That was the one that, okay, that was, don't, I got to, okay, right here, installing. I don't think

1535
05:19:02,220 --> 05:20:31,250
they know where to go. Yeah, they do. How long does this take to do this? I hope I'm doing this

1536
05:20:31,250 --> 05:21:27,360
right. Cause this is long, man. This is a long time. I'm going to imagine if I did this and it was

1537
05:21:27,360 --> 05:21:32,400
just like a fuck you germa at the end and this doesn't, was supposed to doing anything. I feel

1538
05:21:32,400 --> 05:21:52,849
like that could happen. Come on, man. Come on. It has to be getting close. It has to be right.

1539
05:21:52,849 --> 05:22:30,720
I'm going to miss a step. Just pay attention. Why does my back hurt? This is not ending. How

1540
05:22:30,720 --> 05:22:46,099
much longer? When do I get to leave this? Okay. I think it's close. I'm just following what it's

1541
05:22:46,099 --> 05:23:14,979
doing. I'm just following the walkthrough. I'm following the walkthrough. I promise. I got it.

1542
05:23:14,979 --> 05:23:54,880
Bingo. All right. Bingo. Scary. A little creepy. Looks like the map to some kind of maze. Christ.

1543
05:24:13,759 --> 05:24:21,599
Where am I right now? I'm taking a picture of this. No, nobody, no human does this without a

1544
05:24:21,599 --> 05:24:37,040
fucking photo. Um, where am I right now? Here or here? Do I know where I am? Follow me. I wonder

1545
05:24:37,040 --> 05:24:56,560
if she expects me to do something. Um, I want you to go. I want you to go. I don't know what,

1546
05:24:56,560 --> 05:25:04,909
I don't know even what direction I'm even facing. What direction are we looking? Around ISIS, around.

1547
05:25:04,909 --> 05:25:21,709
This map is meaningless unless I know what direction I'm looking. What? All right. Even

1548
05:25:21,709 --> 05:25:28,419
the dog doesn't want to do this. The dog doesn't want to do this either. All right. So let's just

1549
05:25:28,419 --> 05:25:34,900
let forward around. Around. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Let's just see what happens.

1550
05:25:34,900 --> 05:25:46,619
ISIS. Around. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Go. I just want to know what I'm even

1551
05:25:46,619 --> 05:26:01,700
looking at. Forward. Forward. Forward. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. Um, forward.

1552
05:26:01,779 --> 05:26:16,369
Forward. Hold on. Forward. Forward four times and then right? Right? Forward. Right. I don't,

1553
05:26:16,369 --> 05:26:23,500
how many commands can I even queue up? ISIS. Forward. Forward. Forward. Forward. Right. Right.

1554
05:26:23,500 --> 05:26:41,139
Go. Your dog is a rudimentary computer, bro. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way.

1555
05:26:41,139 --> 05:26:48,180
I did forward four times. One, two, three, four. There are four dots. What are you talking about?

1556
05:26:54,619 --> 05:27:02,770
Forward. Forward. Forward. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. I'm going to stop. ISIS. Forward.

1557
05:27:02,770 --> 05:27:21,520
Forward. Forward. Right. Right. Right. Go. You start on the first one. Forward. Forward. Right.

1558
05:27:21,520 --> 05:27:39,889
This dog is not doing the correct thing. Is it, will it go until it hits a wall? Forward one.

1559
05:27:41,020 --> 05:27:53,860
Forward. Then right? Right. Left. Left. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Forward. Right.

1560
05:27:53,860 --> 05:28:06,990
Okay, well there is, I can't go past the gates. I have to get to the jump over the gate. Okay,

1561
05:28:06,990 --> 05:28:15,900
what if, okay, forward jump? Forward. Jump. Jump. Let's just see what that does. ISIS. Forward.

1562
05:28:15,900 --> 05:28:22,369
Jump. Go. You start at the first dot. Yeah, well then why, why did, why did the dog go five dots?

1563
05:28:22,369 --> 05:28:30,450
I said three forwards, not five. I said forward once here. Okay, you just go until you hit something.

1564
05:28:30,450 --> 05:28:48,639
I, can somebody please explain to me what on earth is going on right now? Is it four circles is one

1565
05:28:48,639 --> 05:28:58,080
forward? So would it be forward, forward, jump? Forward. Jump. ISIS. Forward. Forward. Jump. Go.

1566
05:28:58,080 --> 05:29:09,889
Every intersection is a command. Will I end up in the, whatever this is in the middle here?

1567
05:29:09,889 --> 05:29:31,810
Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. Forward. Right. Forward. Right. Does that actually

1568
05:29:31,810 --> 05:29:54,990
work though? I feel like this is not working. Forward. Right. Go. Forward. Right. Okay, forward.

1569
05:29:54,990 --> 05:30:10,990
Right. Forward. Jump over the hole and then pop. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. What about under

1570
05:30:10,990 --> 05:30:22,659
the gate? Down. Each command is an obstacle. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Forward. Left.

1571
05:30:22,659 --> 05:30:34,180
Right. Left. Jump. ISIS. Forward. Left. Right. Left. Jump. Go. Why'd you just do left? Somebody said it.

1572
05:30:34,180 --> 05:30:39,860
Right. Left. Not. Right. Chat is moving so fast. I'm sorry I got the one guy that gave me the

1573
05:30:39,860 --> 05:30:57,360
fucking bogus directions. Looks like some kind of gate is in her way. I can't even take it anymore.

1574
05:30:57,360 --> 05:31:05,119
Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. Forward. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. ISIS. Forward.

1575
05:31:05,200 --> 05:31:09,520
Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. We're losing respect for you? I don't think you are. I think everyone

1576
05:31:09,520 --> 05:31:15,840
can look at this and go, this is kind of fucking cheesy. This is cheesy. This is like a stinky

1577
05:31:15,840 --> 05:31:39,150
cheese. My respect for you went up actually. Yeah, thanks. Now what? What did we just do to the dog?

1578
05:31:45,650 --> 05:32:04,580
We beamed him up into outer space. Now what? Okay, that was just Liam Neeson jumping over a fence

1579
05:32:04,580 --> 05:32:23,869
with 12 cuts. I could have just walked up that easily, right? Like we didn't have... Now where

1580
05:32:23,869 --> 05:32:38,700
am I going? A moose, a wolf, a raccoon, and a pig. The same animals Trapper Dan mentioned in his

1581
05:32:38,700 --> 05:32:43,500
journal when it came to getting into his needle without the key. I'll bet that's what's behind

1582
05:32:43,500 --> 05:32:48,860
this wall. A room below the needle. Next thing I have to do is get each of these panels open.

1583
05:32:48,860 --> 05:33:21,939
Bro, what is this game? I have to get all the panels open? Where's the dog? Oh, I have two

1584
05:33:21,939 --> 05:34:10,299
coins. Okay, what about right? Oh, hi. Good job, I think. And then no nine-year-olds beating this

1585
05:34:10,299 --> 05:34:13,659
game. Nine-year-olds gonna cry. They're gonna get to a point they're gonna be crying because it's

1586
05:34:13,659 --> 05:34:22,830
just... A nine-year-old will cry. No way. Should have picked the child. Should have picked the

1587
05:34:22,830 --> 05:34:34,959
children. Fucking difficulty. Okay, I need to obviously flip up all these switches and have

1588
05:34:34,959 --> 05:34:42,369
all four of the infinity stones. I need to get all of the stones and then come back here again

1589
05:34:42,369 --> 05:35:01,229
and then do all this bullshit again. I mean, that's what I have to do. That's what I have to do.

1590
05:35:06,369 --> 05:35:34,529
I have to... I can't do this. This is a punishment. It kind of is. Okay, this four switches in the

1591
05:35:34,529 --> 05:35:42,830
tunnel. But I'm gonna need the four horsemen of the apocalypse. I need the other two coins. Oh,

1592
05:35:42,830 --> 05:35:53,310
it's too late to walk back to the lodge now. I'd better spend the night here. When you make the

1593
05:35:53,310 --> 05:35:57,389
dog pull the rope, you're on a timer. You have to run back to the lodge and get the pig token and

1594
05:35:57,389 --> 05:36:02,299
the pig head. Is that accurate? Because if it is, I cannot understand how that would be a thing.

1595
05:36:02,299 --> 05:36:29,729
That's not accurate. Oh, that can't be right. The timer is reset now. Do I actually have to do this

1596
05:36:29,729 --> 05:36:59,650
again? A whole day went by. I slept in the shack. The timer reset? Did the timer actually reset?

1597
05:36:59,650 --> 05:37:13,520
No way. Do you have to beat the guy at that coyote game three times now? No, I don't.

1598
05:37:13,520 --> 05:37:42,770
You're making it up. Nancy, what is going on? Nancy, what is going on with this one?

1599
05:37:42,770 --> 05:37:52,619
Why is there a sleep mechanic in the game? You know what I mean? Like, why is there like,

1600
05:37:52,619 --> 05:38:03,810
go go to bed and reset stuff? No, why is it? Why do I have to do people's laundry? What's going on

1601
05:38:03,810 --> 05:38:30,270
in this game? I'm not even here. I'm about to watch the rest of this on YouTube. And by this,

1602
05:38:30,270 --> 05:38:34,669
I mean, they just like what happens at the end. Chantal's on the phone, Nancy. Oh my god. I don't

1603
05:38:34,669 --> 05:39:06,049
stop being a negative Nancy. I can't believe I actually have to go back. Chantal's counting

1604
05:39:06,049 --> 05:39:12,130
on me to get those rooms cleaned. I should go do that. Is there a why is there a clean the rooms

1605
05:39:12,130 --> 05:39:20,860
mechanic? Why? Nobody wants to do what I'm doing right now. I don't want to. I want to solve the

1606
05:39:20,860 --> 05:39:36,779
fucking murder mystery. Why is there a go up and clean the room mechanic? What is this for? I don't

1607
05:39:36,779 --> 05:39:42,060
care. Fuck off. I don't care. I'll close it. I'm not going to even go over there. My jacket. I'm

1608
05:39:42,060 --> 05:40:00,700
getting a definite feeling I'm not wanted here. My jacket. Okay. I know who did it. We already

1609
05:40:00,779 --> 05:40:13,950
we've done this for like an hour and a half. Is there a room done or what? I think I'm good. I

1610
05:40:13,950 --> 05:40:21,659
need not just leave. I don't get call me again. Why is she not wearing the jacket? Yeah. I do. I

1611
05:40:21,659 --> 05:40:26,299
actually have to have the dog pull that and run back here. I really hope that's not bait. I can't

1612
05:40:26,299 --> 05:40:39,250
go anywhere. I still haven't cleaned all those rooms. Oh my god. I do. I have to actually do

1613
05:40:39,250 --> 05:40:46,430
the laundry too. This late in the game. You're going to maybe do the fucking laundry. I'm pissed

1614
05:40:46,430 --> 05:40:53,150
right now. We're like moments away from solving the mystery. Make sure you go clean the rooms

1615
05:40:53,150 --> 05:41:05,099
and shit. Let me finish the game. I don't want to cook lunch and go clean. Why? What earth do I

1616
05:41:05,099 --> 05:41:42,209
have to do this? I'm livid right now. I click too fast and the game operates on six screens in this

1617
05:41:42,209 --> 05:41:57,220
hallway. I don't even know if I'm getting it all. I'm just trying to rush because this is a crap.

1618
05:41:57,220 --> 05:42:09,200
This is a crap part of the game and we all know it. Why am I reviewing this old Nancy Drew game

1619
05:42:09,200 --> 05:42:24,689
from 2007 like it came out last night? I don't know and I don't care. Much better. I'm really

1620
05:42:24,689 --> 05:42:56,270
cold. I can't. Get me the fuck out of here. The pig head thing is not bait. My wife plays these

1621
05:42:56,270 --> 05:43:04,000
games and is very upset. Also the wolf token is in the basement. I really actually have to do that?

1622
05:43:04,000 --> 05:43:34,669
Wait. You should back down here. What's happening right now? Okay. Okay. I was going to say I'm not

1623
05:43:34,669 --> 05:43:58,540
going to do that again, right? Okay. We need to have him do all the levers so let's just get it

1624
05:43:58,540 --> 05:44:08,580
over with. So with that being said, we need to do all the levers. We need to get it over with.

1625
05:44:08,580 --> 05:44:30,000
Apologize to his wife. Why? Because I said this game sucks? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1626
05:44:30,000 --> 05:44:40,459
I'm kidding. Relax. It's a joke. I could never say that about the Drew crew and Nancy Drew. Come on.

1627
05:44:40,459 --> 05:44:47,840
I've just eaten at least three pieces of this chapstick in frustration over the last hour and

1628
05:44:47,840 --> 05:44:54,720
25 minutes. I would never say something like that about the Drew crew. Speaking of the Drew crew,

1629
05:44:54,720 --> 05:45:05,409
they could give me a quick hand here. Just give me the exact combination to do all this.

1630
05:45:05,409 --> 05:45:10,110
Speaking directly to the Drew crew right now. Just give me the exact combination.

1631
05:45:10,110 --> 05:45:14,319
We all know I don't want to do this. We know you don't want to do it either, but one of us has to.

1632
05:45:16,400 --> 05:45:21,779
And we all know it ain't going to be me. I'm busy looking directly into the center of the screen and

1633
05:45:21,779 --> 05:45:33,740
not moving my arms. Everybody else do it. Show us the map. I can't alt tab this game either. That's

1634
05:45:33,740 --> 05:45:40,669
the problem. Wait. Here's the combination. Oh shit. Somebody actually has it. I can't even bark.

1635
05:45:40,669 --> 05:45:57,060
It's so easy. This really isn't. It's easy if you like, I've checked out. I clocked out like 30, 40

1636
05:45:57,060 --> 05:46:01,360
minutes ago. I'm not kidding. Like it would be easy if I like looked at this map and was like,

1637
05:46:01,360 --> 05:46:05,840
oh, like one, two, three, five, two, four, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. I checked out.

1638
05:46:05,840 --> 05:46:13,840
I checked out like 30 minutes ago. They took bark off this too, which I wouldn't you check out as

1639
05:46:13,840 --> 05:46:34,270
well. I fucked up my shower. You should have called somebody. Okay. Forward. Forward. Left.

1640
05:46:35,150 --> 05:47:02,610
Paw. Forward. Left. Left. Paw. Isis. Forward. Left. Left. Paw. Go. Looks like some kind of gate

1641
05:47:02,610 --> 05:47:15,680
is in her way. That's not right. Forward. Right. Left. Right. Jump. And then I have to run out.

1642
05:47:15,680 --> 05:47:22,610
Do I have to, I probably, do I have to do something else to get those bars to move?

1643
05:47:22,610 --> 05:47:35,360
Or was it forward. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. What was it? Forward. Right. Left. Right.

1644
05:47:35,360 --> 05:47:50,590
Jump. Isis. And then I have to run out of here. Right. Left. Right. Jump. Go. You've opened the

1645
05:47:50,590 --> 05:47:58,639
red gates. You need to win the Fox game on those three sides. This game was not for kids. It

1646
05:47:58,639 --> 05:48:14,430
wasn't. There's no way it was. I played it as a kid. Yeah. And we all know you gave up after the

1647
05:48:14,430 --> 05:48:26,799
first explosion. You were like, whoa. All right. I'm doing something else. Pull it. Now run. Go,

1648
05:48:26,799 --> 05:48:52,930
go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go. Hurry, hurry. Mom's never going to let him play Diablo.

1649
05:48:52,930 --> 05:48:56,290
I think I'm conceding that I'm not going to be playing Diablo tonight because this is the whole

1650
05:48:56,290 --> 05:49:10,159
stream. It was fun though. I had fun. I hope you guys had fun. It's been a great time.

1651
05:49:10,159 --> 05:49:18,259
As frustrated as I've been at some of this. No, the slide puzzles. No, the slide puzzles get you.

1652
05:49:18,259 --> 05:49:31,630
They really do. No, I'm having fun. Everyone at the beginning of 2020, I can handle anything.

1653
05:49:31,630 --> 05:49:37,470
2020, nevermind. Is it just me or has 2020 felt like one long game of Fox and Geese?

1654
05:49:37,470 --> 05:49:58,669
That's from the official Nancy Drew account. What? That's the official Nancy Drew account said that.

1655
05:49:58,669 --> 05:50:04,619
They made their game harder than Dark Souls and Dark Souls wouldn't even out yet. So

1656
05:50:05,180 --> 05:50:15,500
they were the original Dark Souls. Much better. I was really cold. Okay. Oh no, go, go, go. Don't

1657
05:50:15,500 --> 05:50:39,549
talk to, don't stop and talk to Chad for a second. Oh, I need to play. Well, sorry to bother you.

1658
05:50:41,869 --> 05:50:56,750
Don't we play this? Now go into the basement. Okay. What's, what's going on in the basement?

1659
05:50:57,229 --> 05:51:03,069
It's gone in case you didn't know. Just up and left. Oh, Chantal's not going to like that.

1660
05:51:03,069 --> 05:51:07,709
The good news is you don't have to do the cooking anymore. I can handle it from here on out.

1661
05:51:07,709 --> 05:51:14,130
Thank God. I'll let you get back to work. By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the

1662
05:51:14,130 --> 05:51:41,459
rooms were cleaned. So I put it back up at the front desk. Oh no. Let's see. Do I really want

1663
05:51:41,459 --> 05:51:50,060
to go outside without a coat? I don't think so. I can't go outside. Not without a coat. It's too cold.

1664
05:51:50,939 --> 05:52:05,630
Let's see. Do I really want to go outside without a coat? What do I do about that? What's radioactive

1665
05:52:05,630 --> 05:52:20,880
right here? I need a coat. Didn't I, I didn't, I didn't click on it. I had, do I actually have to

1666
05:52:20,880 --> 05:52:24,799
get my coat on? I did. I clicked on it. It was a note on it, but I didn't pick it back up. I thought

1667
05:52:24,799 --> 05:53:11,409
I did. Where's my coat? This isn't even my room. This is my room. Where's my coat? There's, there's

1668
05:53:11,409 --> 05:53:32,860
a reading here. Yeah. It's this, it's this thing right here. 13. See the reading at the bottom left.

1669
05:53:33,099 --> 05:53:37,599
Go down to the main floor. Go right and go left side of the kitchen door. There's a high reading

1670
05:53:37,599 --> 05:53:45,779
by the dinosaur bow and stool decor. Go down to the basement. Go forward after they get another

1671
05:53:45,779 --> 05:53:49,459
high reading. After the stairs and the cellar door, face the stairs and get the highest reading.

1672
05:53:49,459 --> 05:54:07,500
Wasn't I just, I was just, I was just standing there. Do I have to get a reading from everything

1673
05:54:07,500 --> 05:54:24,580
that needs to be read before I can do that? Click the bottom stair. What in the, do I have them all

1674
05:54:24,580 --> 05:54:37,389
now? I didn't know. One, two, three, four. I got them all. All right. We're almost there. We're

1675
05:54:37,389 --> 05:54:46,099
almost there. I have to beat this guy three times. This is going to be a nightmare. I'm just going to

1676
05:54:46,099 --> 05:54:50,500
click in random places until I get it. I'll put up like a family guy clip compilation or something

1677
05:54:50,500 --> 05:54:57,619
in the corner if I can't do it. Please just leave me alone. I'm just, I'm trying to literally walk

1678
05:54:57,619 --> 05:55:12,380
up the stairs, but I have to walk in a full circle to go up the stairs. No, I have to go to, I have

1679
05:55:12,380 --> 05:55:47,520
a sleep cycle. Go to bed and wake up and play the guy. It's too early. Go back to bed. Get, get,

1680
05:55:47,520 --> 05:56:03,500
get, I wish I could just click on the room. Where is this guy? Where is this? Why would he never be

1681
05:56:03,500 --> 05:56:08,700
here? Why would there be a code, a line of code where he wouldn't be sitting here? It's 3 PM.

1682
05:56:09,259 --> 05:57:06,060
Go back to the mines. Back to the mines. I have all the tokens, but all I, I can't,

1683
05:57:07,340 --> 05:57:14,880
I need to open the gates, the red gates. If I don't have the red gates open, I can't do anything.

1684
05:57:15,360 --> 05:57:20,930
So how do I get the red gates to open? Play this guy three times, but he's not even here.

1685
05:57:20,930 --> 05:57:33,759
Do I have to go to bed until he comes back? You don't have to. Oh my God. You don't have to.

1686
05:57:33,759 --> 05:57:53,549
All right. Well then I'm, all right, I'm going. Got all the coins. So you have to play the game.

1687
05:57:53,549 --> 05:57:59,650
Well, they didn't code him in to be there. He's not there. Something tells me I shouldn't be

1688
05:57:59,650 --> 05:58:07,020
making this much noise. Not when I'm walking in a place called Avalanche Ridge. Where are my shoes?

1689
05:58:07,659 --> 05:58:36,689
You should play something else. I feel like we're in way too deep and we were in way too

1690
05:58:36,689 --> 05:58:49,060
deep after I said I would play this today. I haven't completed a Nancy Drew game in two or

1691
05:58:49,060 --> 05:59:06,880
three years. The lanterns in here are basically just rocks hung in cages. I wonder what makes

1692
05:59:06,880 --> 05:59:11,919
the rocks glow like that. I don't know, but I wouldn't be breathing in that deeply because

1693
05:59:11,919 --> 05:59:42,639
it's like, apparently like it's radiation. Next thing I have to do is get each of these panels

1694
05:59:42,639 --> 06:00:10,180
open. Glad I just came all the way to do that. You actually have to beat him three more times.

1695
06:00:16,819 --> 06:00:20,580
Why is he not just sitting there? If that, if that is like a core

1696
06:00:21,459 --> 06:00:28,049
thing you have to do to beat the game, why would he, how would anybody, he needs to be sitting there

1697
06:00:28,049 --> 06:00:34,209
at the table ready to play. Not, not there and not sleeping. He needs to be sitting at the table.

1698
06:00:34,209 --> 06:01:10,209
Dude, you got to get out of there. The uranium is getting to your brain. All right. Let's go back

1699
06:01:10,209 --> 06:01:21,299
and play. I can't believe I have to play this game three more times. Yeah. I've got the pig token.

1700
06:01:21,299 --> 06:02:05,380
Set your alarm clock to earlier in the day to bury these games in a fucking landfill. Like they

1701
06:02:05,380 --> 06:02:22,299
did ET warm again. How about another game of Fox and Geese? How about another game of Fox and Geese?

1702
06:02:22,299 --> 06:02:29,810
Now you're talking. Have a seat. Ready? You don't mind if we at least little pig I found. Do you

1703
06:02:29,810 --> 06:02:39,200
mind if we use this little pig I found in place of the Fox piece? Fine by me. And now what? Now

1704
06:02:39,200 --> 06:02:45,279
what do I have to do? I have to corner. Well, I have to have to in different directions.

1705
06:02:46,610 --> 06:03:00,259
Heard the pig by surrounding with a geese squares. Good luck. But is this just the same game or is it

1706
06:03:00,259 --> 06:03:21,520
different somehow? Do I have to corner him in this corner over here? You've got to be shitting me.

1707
06:03:21,520 --> 06:03:44,779
You're going to be shitting me. There's no way there's, I actually, you have to do this.

1708
06:03:44,779 --> 06:04:00,159
All right. I'm going to move them over to the raccoon and I guess this won't be that bad. It's

1709
06:04:00,159 --> 06:04:17,619
going to be bad to do the pig though. Put him in the pig corner. Dude, this sucks. Okay. Oh my God.

1710
06:04:17,619 --> 06:04:41,360
You know what? You know what? I'm about to pull a plug on this. This is, this sucks. Okay. Have we

1711
06:04:41,360 --> 06:05:20,700
start over? I have an ad. Hold on. Give me 10 minutes. This looks so, so fucking annoying.

1712
06:05:21,500 --> 06:05:25,340
Okay. This sucks. I'm going to have to take this physically forever.

1713
06:05:28,700 --> 06:05:33,650
No, family guy has brought to you in part by that commercial you just saw.

1714
06:05:47,090 --> 06:05:55,060
Why did they pad Nancy Drew to be like a nine to 10 hour game? Like they got to the end here

1715
06:05:55,700 --> 06:06:04,180
and instead of just ending the game, they put like a two hour padding on it. Why? Why is there,

1716
06:06:04,180 --> 06:06:10,909
why do I have to, why is there at least a 45 minute to an hour padding on the final part of the game?

1717
06:06:10,909 --> 06:06:18,529
I don't remember the other Nancy Drew games doing this. You know what? I'm not,

1718
06:06:18,529 --> 06:11:02,259
I don't care about a guide. We're doing it my way. Now get up there. I was right there. Get me. Shit.

1719
06:11:02,259 --> 06:11:07,549
Is the mic off? No, I'm just really trying to focus because I don't want to lose this because

1720
06:11:07,549 --> 06:11:46,700
I almost got them up there. Here. Nobody knows what you're doing. I'm, yeah, they do. I'm trying to

1721
06:11:46,700 --> 06:12:05,500
trap the pig up here. I'm kind of, I'm this one maybe just to get it in here. No, no, no. Back,

1722
06:12:05,500 --> 06:12:25,979
move it back. Got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. All right. He ain't going anywhere. I got him.

1723
06:12:25,979 --> 06:12:53,169
So then this is go in the middle. It can't get me from anywhere in the middle. I will be able to go

1724
06:12:53,169 --> 06:13:01,200
up when he does. Now I'm not getting cocky because he's probably going to go, he's probably going to

1725
06:13:01,200 --> 06:13:06,779
go down and then I'm going to move the one that's left up. All right. That's, that's still good for

1726
06:13:06,779 --> 06:13:42,849
us. We can trap him here. That's even, that's better for us. We're good. I fucked it up. I fucked it

1727
06:13:42,849 --> 06:14:06,720
up. I ruined everything. I ruined it. Didn't I? Fucked it up. I fucked it up. I'm good. No, I'm good.

1728
06:14:06,720 --> 06:14:16,130
I got him. I win.

1729
06:14:24,979 --> 06:14:26,259
But this time I want to use a different one.

1730
06:14:39,520 --> 06:14:44,799
I want to replace my, wait, do I want to, was it, do I have to use a different coin?

1731
06:14:44,799 --> 06:14:57,970
Why can I not use a different coin? It's just the pig pile you use.

1732
06:14:58,849 --> 06:15:05,759
Oh, I thought it was like pig went up there, raccoon coin. Okay. So it doesn't matter. All right.

1733
06:15:05,759 --> 06:16:25,090
Well, let's just even get them over here. Are we quiet? Did I do that before? What? Oh, no, no,

1734
06:16:25,090 --> 06:16:30,860
no, no, no, no. Stay over there. Stay over there. You're, we're good. Stay over there. I just won.

1735
06:16:30,860 --> 06:16:40,060
I just beat him. I just beat him. Hold on. He's over here. Wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1736
06:16:40,060 --> 06:17:05,310
God damn it. He can get out. I can't block him. You went in three moves. I don't know what those

1737
06:17:05,310 --> 06:17:18,080
moves are. I know I can, but give me a hand here. I don't want to fuck around. And one in the middle

1738
06:17:18,080 --> 06:18:07,169
is what I want to do. Okay. So where do I go? Middle one, middle down left, right? Middle diagonal left.

1739
06:18:17,840 --> 06:18:31,090
All right. So, this thing's dead. I can't move anything here. This is, he's going to get out,

1740
06:18:31,090 --> 06:18:44,159
move it back. Nah, he's going to get out. I guess I'm going to try to do what I was doing before and

1741
06:18:44,159 --> 06:19:44,270
just get him over here. Okay. Now get out of here. There we go. Okay. I'm in such a bad position,

1742
06:19:44,270 --> 06:20:10,130
though, to try to get him to, I'm just going to start moving shit. Like I have to. Okay. Move

1743
06:20:10,130 --> 06:22:07,459
forward this one. Good. Don't go that way. Do not go that way, please. Thank you. That's fine. This

1744
06:22:07,459 --> 06:22:13,299
dude can't be fucking safe. Yes. Dude, I, all right. For those of you that don't know, I have to get

1745
06:22:13,299 --> 06:22:18,500
him in each one of these stupid ass slots. They tweeted about this. This was a meme to their

1746
06:22:18,500 --> 06:22:22,500
development team. They even said, wow, it's like, well, really it wasn't fucking, wow,

1747
06:22:22,500 --> 06:22:30,189
it was something, wasn't it? They are, they did that. The game devs already told you that this was

1748
06:22:30,189 --> 06:22:43,229
a long ass, stupid ass part of the game. Okay. I'm just participating. I don't know. Hold on.

1749
06:22:43,229 --> 06:23:18,180
He needs to go back up. Actually kind of good, I think. I can't go that way. Get up here. Build

1750
06:23:18,180 --> 06:23:28,459
the edges. Yeah, but he only moves into, he won't go up there. See? Like get the, stop going. He

1751
06:23:28,459 --> 06:23:32,779
goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Just go up here and try to kill something.

1752
06:23:32,779 --> 06:23:40,639
Because if I put this down here, he's going to go up here and then he's going to go bunk, bunk, bunk.

1753
06:23:40,639 --> 06:24:29,389
Don't do it. He's going to go down here and he's going to jump me. If I go right here, he's going

1754
06:24:29,389 --> 06:24:43,549
to go back to that one and he's going to jump over my ass. He's definitely not going to go into the

1755
06:24:43,549 --> 06:24:59,840
corner. I mean, this is, I could just see what he does. He's going to move backwards. I got to get

1756
06:24:59,840 --> 06:25:15,900
this, I got to get a piece down in the corner. Why is he doing that? Wait, no, no, he can't go

1757
06:25:15,900 --> 06:25:33,950
that way. He can't go diagonal. Can he? Wait, I think he can. That's freaking me out. No, he

1758
06:25:33,950 --> 06:25:45,650
definitely can't. Okay. Okay. This is in the right spot. Go back up there. All right. Now let me see

1759
06:25:45,650 --> 06:25:52,099
what happens if I do this. Okay. He'll only go there and there. If I move this down here, he's

1760
06:25:52,099 --> 06:26:02,750
going to move probably down, right? He's going to jump that. This has to come down. Damn it.

1761
06:26:03,389 --> 06:26:31,439
Because if I block this and he jumps, he does a double jump. I don't, I don't know how I'm going

1762
06:26:31,439 --> 06:26:38,689
to get him to stay over here. Cause it seems like he has an escape every time. Sacrifice a middle

1763
06:26:38,689 --> 06:26:44,479
piece to make him jump into the corner. That's not a bad idea. Put this here and just make him

1764
06:26:44,479 --> 06:26:49,419
jump over here. I guess I could do that. I hope it's not going to be a problem, but I guess we're

1765
06:26:49,419 --> 06:27:15,889
going for it. Okay. Now, now he's trapped in here. There's now nowhere for him to go. He could go

1766
06:27:15,889 --> 06:27:24,000
this way if he wants to, which, okay. So hold on. If he moves to the left, he's going to jump this

1767
06:27:24,080 --> 06:27:44,990
or down. I need to block this. He's, I mean, he's going to go up, stop and look. I know,

1768
06:27:44,990 --> 06:28:01,150
but these games are so just, it's just brain mush. The experience, the bottom piece, like this one,

1769
06:28:01,150 --> 06:28:07,970
he's, he's going to jump up. They just, somebody had a bet in their game studio. Like,

1770
06:28:07,970 --> 06:28:12,529
can we make a Nancy Drew game, a 20 hour game? No, impossible. I'll just make them do this five

1771
06:28:12,529 --> 06:28:28,060
times. Oh, done. We did it. He can jump this. I have to block this or he's gone.

1772
06:28:28,060 --> 06:28:43,099
Okay. Now he can't move diagonal. So if he goes down, he could jump to the left,

1773
06:28:43,099 --> 06:29:40,779
but that's fine. Cause I can move this here and I think we got them. Not quite. I don't know what

1774
06:29:40,779 --> 06:30:09,060
to do. Ah, you beat me. Another win. Another set of red eyes. All right. No, one more, one more.

1775
06:30:09,060 --> 06:31:44,610
I took it to this one more time and we went, okay. If we start over, get in there. Why are you doing

1776
06:31:44,610 --> 06:33:16,590
that? Get in there. What the fuck did you just do? What did you just do to me? What did you just do?

1777
06:33:18,159 --> 06:33:34,139
Get over there. What's happening? Okay. If we start over, my fucking God,

1778
06:33:34,139 --> 06:33:44,770
this is the stupidest fucking thing ever. Kidding me, man. Like, it's just like, I, who won?

1779
06:33:44,770 --> 06:33:50,189
Nobody wants to do this puzzle. I, I guarantee you, all of you that have ever played this,

1780
06:33:50,189 --> 06:33:58,479
probably saw this happen and you went, Oh, fuck. No. Who wanted to do this? I don't even know

1781
06:33:58,479 --> 06:34:02,209
anybody that would even make this. That would say, you know what? I want to do this five times.

1782
06:34:02,209 --> 06:34:07,729
Who would ever want to do this five times in a row? Unless you download the Fox and the fucking goose

1783
06:34:08,619 --> 06:34:15,490
game. That's like what I'm trying to do. That's what I'm doing. Like who wants to play this?

1784
06:34:15,490 --> 06:34:31,709
Besides people that actively are looking to play the Fox and the goose game. It was so close too,

1785
06:34:31,709 --> 06:35:45,180
but it's just, God, hurry off. Wait, you can't go that way. You, where was this one? Yeah, yeah,

1786
06:35:45,180 --> 06:35:57,470
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one o'clock in the morning. What happened? Oh my God. It's 1 a.m.

1787
06:35:57,470 --> 06:36:30,639
I must got you, you motherfucker. Go that way. You're in trouble. I must got you, you motherfucker.

1788
06:36:30,639 --> 06:37:47,470
That's the correct play here. What do I do? Top one. Can you screw me if I move this here?

1789
06:37:47,470 --> 06:37:55,520
As long as I move this and then the one right next to the right. If I go this one here and then this

1790
06:37:55,520 --> 06:38:07,220
one here, he can't do anything, right? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm seeing a lot of nos. He'll take

1791
06:38:07,220 --> 06:38:26,669
the piece above it. Will he though? He doesn't have anywhere to go. I think that's correct.

1792
06:38:26,669 --> 06:38:36,750
Yeah, it is correct because now that's fine. I can sacrifice that one. Now he's in a bad spot.

1793
06:38:36,750 --> 06:38:56,610
Oh my God. I couldn't hold that one. You can't. Wait, wait, wait. He can't go this way. He can't.

1794
06:38:56,610 --> 06:39:03,709
He has to go left. Fill out the corners. Wait, wait. I know. I just have been doing this for

1795
06:39:03,709 --> 06:39:12,000
so long and my brain is having problems. I think it's fine. This moves here, right? Or do I just

1796
06:39:12,000 --> 06:39:24,619
try to block him now? If I move this here, he has to go left. Block the middle one and then take the

1797
06:39:24,619 --> 06:39:35,709
top one, top left. This one goes top left now. He can't go anywhere. He really can't do much of

1798
06:39:35,709 --> 06:40:45,060
anything. I win soon. Give me my token now. Another set of red eyes. Give me my token right now.

1799
06:40:45,060 --> 06:40:56,689
That's it. I win. This game over. I thought the building was on fire. Let's go. Let's go. All

1800
06:40:56,689 --> 06:41:03,950
right. Let's get out of here. It's like I was convinced that the building was on fire. Way too

1801
06:41:03,950 --> 06:41:15,840
cold to go out there now. I have to do it one more time? No, I don't. I already beat him once.

1802
06:41:15,840 --> 06:41:27,169
No, no, no, no. It's only three. It's only three. It's not one more. They all have to be red. Yeah,

1803
06:41:27,169 --> 06:41:33,139
no, that's the one guy. Okay. No, we're good. This is kind of a lot of guys. I'm getting up

1804
06:41:33,139 --> 06:41:46,880
bright and early in the morning. How do I make this? What time I wake up? Right there. Fine.

1805
06:41:46,880 --> 06:41:56,259
No, not 12 a.m. Oh, that sucks when you do a.m. instead of p.m. I've been there before. Your whole

1806
06:41:56,259 --> 06:42:03,979
life comes crashing down because you've been awoken very rudely and sometimes it's not really,

1807
06:42:03,979 --> 06:42:07,389
you know, you can't go back to bed. So then you just screw it for the rest of the day.

1808
06:42:07,389 --> 06:42:22,139
It sucks. I've been there before. All right, let's go. Time to see the conclusion of Nancy Drew.

1809
06:42:23,119 --> 06:42:55,229
Wilderness of the wild white fox. The title is not correct. Yeah, the title is not correct.

1810
06:42:55,229 --> 06:42:59,389
I get this still. Oh, my God. There's a lot of people still here at one o'clock in the morning.

1811
06:42:59,389 --> 06:43:03,630
Hey, well, we're good. We go till we beat it. I, you know, even if I have a few complaints,

1812
06:43:03,630 --> 06:43:09,060
the game was probably a nine point five out of ten. And then when we had to do the four games of

1813
06:43:09,060 --> 06:43:13,779
reverse, whatever the hell that is, brought it down at least two letter grades at least.

1814
06:43:14,419 --> 06:43:36,369
Now we get to have this fun. Let's see. So I got a picture of it. I've been like screaming,

1815
06:43:36,369 --> 06:43:41,419
too. It's been it's been kind of a wild stream. Sorry about that. Today was going to be like a

1816
06:43:41,419 --> 06:43:54,909
chill day. No cam. Sorry. We'll make up for it next time. All right. Here we go. All the gates are

1817
06:43:54,909 --> 06:44:05,950
open. So we just need forward, forward, jump forward. So forward, forward, forward, jump.

1818
06:44:05,950 --> 06:44:30,209
Let's try it. Four, four, four, jump, Isis, forward, forward, forward, jump, go forward,

1819
06:44:30,209 --> 06:44:53,860
forward, forward, forward, forward, forward, jump. Oh, forget it. Four, four, four,

1820
06:44:53,860 --> 06:45:03,889
jump. Isis, forward, forward, forward, jump, paw, go Australian hours. Yeah, I'll tell you there's

1821
06:45:03,889 --> 06:45:10,590
a lot of I look at the demographics of the channel. There's a lot of people from Australia that watch.

1822
06:45:10,590 --> 06:45:23,659
I actually think it's like the third or fourth demographic highest. So hello Australia, Asia too.

1823
06:45:23,659 --> 06:45:27,979
Yeah, but just just pure demographic wise, Australia is I think number three or four.

1824
06:45:27,979 --> 06:45:41,619
You stream at great Aussie hours. Well, that's good. So that was one. OK, now the other ones

1825
06:45:41,619 --> 06:46:09,139
looks like left, left, paw, left, right, paw. Let's try left, left, left, right, paw, Isis, left,

1826
06:46:10,020 --> 06:46:19,299
right, paw, forward. I think I think Isis goes forward already. Does it account for the first

1827
06:46:19,299 --> 06:46:39,069
intersection? It doesn't. OK, so forward, left, left, right, paw, forward, left, right, paw, Isis,

1828
06:46:39,069 --> 06:46:56,240
forward, left, left, right, paw, go. I go right because forward, left, left. Do I have to turn

1829
06:46:56,240 --> 06:47:10,830
that corner? I think is what I this is left is left, right. What happened? Forward. Do I not need

1830
06:47:10,830 --> 06:47:14,909
OK, so that that corner on the bottom doesn't matter. So it's just forward, left, left, paw.

1831
06:47:14,909 --> 06:47:29,650
You don't need to go right. OK, so forward, left, left, paw, forward, left, paw, Isis, forward, left,

1832
06:47:29,650 --> 06:47:39,040
left, paw, go. There's no intersection there. Yeah, that's true. Why is the cave green? That

1833
06:47:39,040 --> 06:47:43,040
would be all the radiation. And I wish I was making that up, but that's actually what that is.

1834
06:47:43,040 --> 06:48:01,810
All right, one more. This looks like it's forward, right, left, paw, forward, right, left, paw. No,

1835
06:48:01,810 --> 06:48:13,409
wait, forward, right, forward. Technically, that's an intersection. What about jump? Oh, there is a

1836
06:48:13,409 --> 06:48:27,569
jump, right? Hold on. So it's forward, forward, right, right, jump or forward again? Forward,

1837
06:48:27,569 --> 06:48:36,369
jump, forward, right, forward, jump. I think, yeah, I think I have to say it. Yeah, I think I have to

1838
06:48:36,529 --> 06:48:51,779
or jump, left, paw, left, paw, Isis, forward, right, forward, jump, left, paw, go. I think that's right.

1839
06:48:51,779 --> 06:49:05,220
Forward, right. This is an intersection here. So forward again, jump over the hole,

1840
06:49:05,220 --> 06:49:18,610
forward again, taking a left paw. There it is. That was fun. I like that one. I just didn't like

1841
06:49:18,610 --> 06:49:24,189
opening all the gates with the convoluted way to do it. I just gained a leather grade,

1842
06:49:24,189 --> 06:49:37,389
one half leather grade. Drink some water. I have been, I'm hydrated, don't worry. All right,

1843
06:49:37,389 --> 06:49:44,029
that is it. It is now time to go open all this shit up and finally see what's going on in this

1844
06:49:44,029 --> 06:50:31,630
world. It's time to party. We like, we like to party. Skiing guy and Lou, both of them,

1845
06:50:32,459 --> 06:50:40,500
they both did it. You see, Brea, this bag must belong to Lou. Oh my gosh, it's full of explosives.

1846
06:50:40,500 --> 06:50:45,779
Lou is the one who's been making those craters. He lied to me. He has been looking for dinosaur

1847
06:50:45,779 --> 06:51:07,279
bones. Nobody behind me. I'm gonna hear clap. Hello. What is this guy doing? Nancy. Yanni,

1848
06:51:07,279 --> 06:51:12,930
what are you doing here? I was skiing, but when I passed the needle, I saw that there was a door in

1849
06:51:12,930 --> 06:51:18,130
it, a door which was open. So I took off my skis to look and now I'm here. You didn't have to play

1850
06:51:18,130 --> 06:51:24,130
reverse heat for four hours. What do you mean? All I know is I found a bag, Lou Talbot's bag,

1851
06:51:24,130 --> 06:51:27,650
and it's full of explosives. There's just a door to come down here. Who is the one who has been

1852
06:51:27,650 --> 06:51:33,889
blowing up things? He is the bomber. He's been excavating dinosaur bones. He may be responsible

1853
06:51:33,889 --> 06:51:38,610
for a lot of the other stuff that's been going on around here too. You must stay here and guard

1854
06:51:38,610 --> 06:51:43,569
the bag. I will ski back to the lodge very quickly and tell the handyman to call the authorities.

1855
06:51:43,569 --> 06:51:55,840
This guy's full of shit. This guy's full of shit. This is very clear. Yeah, this is the villain.

1856
06:52:06,110 --> 06:52:06,909
There's 990.

1857
06:52:15,840 --> 06:52:19,360
A person who's been wearing that snowmobiling suit and blowing things up

1858
06:52:19,360 --> 06:52:26,080
is Yanni. Geophone data. Uranium. Oh my gosh, he set the timer.

1859
06:52:28,080 --> 06:52:33,040
Oh, there was just a door. We've got to get out of here. I was skiing and I found a door and I

1860
06:52:33,040 --> 06:52:40,900
walked in it. No, it would have been more believable if you told me. I had to play that

1861
06:52:40,900 --> 06:52:48,990
old man at that game that he played to beat him four times. It was very tricky.

1862
06:52:54,720 --> 06:52:59,040
You don't say I found a door. Like, buddy, I've been looking around this place for three weeks.

1863
06:53:28,959 --> 06:53:41,330
Get away from me. Snowmobile race. I hate that I can see all the gross shit on my monitor.

1864
06:53:52,689 --> 06:54:03,459
No way. We both just did that. You know, you have those moments where you just go, man,

1865
06:54:03,459 --> 06:54:17,060
I sneezed like a month ago and it's still right there, isn't it? What the hell? Where are you

1866
06:54:17,060 --> 06:55:53,659
taking him? Get over here. This is so stupid. Oh my goodness. Can I cut across somewhere, maybe?

1867
06:55:54,860 --> 06:56:08,290
I don't know. Yep. That's the play. All right. If we go past there again, I'm going that other way.

1868
06:56:09,009 --> 06:57:51,409
I'm trying to cut him off. God damn it. Oh, no. Oh my God. That's a Wario screamer that was.

1869
06:57:51,409 --> 06:57:56,689
Lying there in the snow, defeated, Yanni owned up to everything. He tainted the potato salad

1870
06:57:56,689 --> 06:58:01,569
with bad mayonnaise. He iced down the back stairs. He opened a gas valve in the sauna.

1871
06:58:01,569 --> 06:58:06,610
He blew up the bunkhouse using the clock he took from Guadalupe's room. And he left those pictures

1872
06:58:06,610 --> 06:58:11,169
of Bill Kessler for me in the sauna. Although he swears the door got stuck by accident in order

1873
06:58:11,169 --> 06:58:16,610
to cast suspicion on someone else. He did all this because he wanted everyone to leave Icicle Creek

1874
06:58:16,610 --> 06:58:21,729
Lodge. Why? Because it turns out that he was actually spying for the government of Fredonia,

1875
06:58:21,729 --> 06:58:27,330
which had sent him to Canada to look for uranium. Apparently his superiors hoped to secretly mine

1876
06:58:27,330 --> 06:58:32,130
what he found and smuggle it back to Fredonia. What they planned to do with it then, even Yanni

1877
06:58:32,130 --> 06:58:36,849
didn't know. But he insisted that he never meant to hurt anyone and that he really was the best

1878
06:58:36,849 --> 06:58:41,569
cross-country skier in the world. Unfortunately, he'll never get a chance to prove that now.

1879
06:58:44,319 --> 06:58:48,560
Chantal has barely been off the phone since she got back to the lodge. It seems that Yanni

1880
06:58:48,560 --> 06:58:53,520
Shenanigans made the nightly news, not just in Canada, but in the States. And as a result,

1881
06:58:53,520 --> 06:58:58,720
people have been booking stays right and left, much to her delight. When I told her and Ollie how

1882
06:58:58,799 --> 06:59:04,240
Isis had helped me, they were truly amazed. Hopefully from now on, Ollie will think twice

1883
06:59:04,240 --> 06:59:09,599
about pulling out his rifle every time he sees a varmint. As for Isis, Guadalupe called me that

1884
06:59:09,599 --> 06:59:14,560
very night and told me she'd found a wolf sanctuary that could take her. How could you tell from the way the

1885
06:59:14,560 --> 06:59:18,880
volunteers from the sanctuary treated her when they came to get her that she'll be in good hands

1886
06:59:18,880 --> 06:59:24,560
at her new home? But still, it's sad that through no fault of her own, she could never run free again.

1887
06:59:25,040 --> 06:59:30,159
They said it's possible that she might someday be released back into the wild, but not very likely.

1888
06:59:32,799 --> 06:59:40,540
I'm going to keep my fingers crossed anyway. I told you. I had it from the very beginning.

1889
06:59:41,340 --> 06:59:47,630
The dog was good. I told you that. You've been awarded the title of

1890
06:59:49,250 --> 07:00:03,979
Dear Detective for Superlatory Sleuthing. Got it? All right. Best suggested we head to New Orleans

1891
07:00:03,979 --> 07:00:10,619
for a short vacation. I thought it was a great idea. The French Quarter, fantastic food, awesome music,

1892
07:00:10,619 --> 07:00:17,180
friendly people, but all it took was one little side trip to check on a friend of Ned's and suddenly

1893
07:00:17,180 --> 07:00:25,819
everything got very strange. A recent death, a musty old mansion, a disturbingly odd curio shop,

1894
07:00:25,819 --> 07:00:31,900
a garden where only secrets seemed to grow, and something as ancient as it was terrifying.

1895
07:00:32,860 --> 07:00:37,340
Join me on my next adventure, Legend of the Crystal Skull.

1896
07:00:37,979 --> 07:00:44,529
I would, Nancy, but unfortunately I'm going to need a shovel to dig out all the buried copies of the game.

1897
07:00:45,169 --> 07:00:59,380
So I did say that that was cute. I liked it. That was cute. It was worth playing it. I'm glad we did it.

1898
07:00:59,380 --> 07:01:04,580
It was a lot of fun to be had lots of funny things. We talked about lots of interesting things we did.

1899
07:01:05,380 --> 07:01:13,650
I liked it. Nancy Drew and the Icicle Wolf of Icicle Creek. Just move those words around.

1900
07:01:13,729 --> 07:01:23,580
To where they belong. So next time you'll see Nancy Drew. Hey, did you really think you were

1901
07:01:23,580 --> 07:01:29,310
going to get a Nancy Drew game today? Yesterday? Did you think you were going to get a Nancy Drew

1902
07:01:29,310 --> 07:01:35,860
game? There's no way that you thought that. And we did it. So I have like 30 of these.

1903
07:01:36,419 --> 07:01:44,819
So we can do another one eventually. And it's fun. You skipped half the game. No, I didn't.

1904
07:01:44,819 --> 07:01:52,590
Half the game was the reverse again. Yeah. With that, I'm going to, I'm going to call it seven

1905
07:01:52,590 --> 07:01:58,049
hours. I think that's a good place to stop. So I'm trying to think of what, is there like a

1906
07:01:58,049 --> 07:02:16,659
post credit scene? You scummed at checkers. Well, I scummed at the coin swap machine thingy. That

1907
07:02:16,659 --> 07:02:23,470
was fun. I had a great time. I always have a great time when I play these. As long as you guys are

1908
07:02:23,470 --> 07:02:28,029
having fun. As long as it's fun to watch and fun to be a part of. That's usually how it works.

1909
07:02:28,590 --> 07:02:36,380
All right. The next stream is going to probably be probably the Resident Evil launch.

1910
07:02:37,020 --> 07:02:46,130
When is that? Two or three days? 23rd, 24th. It's probably the 24th in the middle of the afternoon.

1911
07:02:59,119 --> 07:03:04,220
Because what's probably going to end up happening is I'm going to play that

1912
07:03:04,220 --> 07:03:15,619
just until it's done. I imagine that's going to be probably like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday ordeal.

1913
07:03:15,619 --> 07:03:24,020
How long is Resident Evil for? It's like 15 to 20 hours or something, right? Somewhere in that

1914
07:03:24,020 --> 07:03:34,580
range. Maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less. So that's what we'll do.

1915
07:03:36,509 --> 07:03:42,799
I will see you guys again on the 24th and we're just going to go until I beat it for two or three

1916
07:03:42,799 --> 07:03:50,189
days in a row. That seems like the next logical time for me to come back. Plus that also gives

1917
07:03:50,189 --> 07:03:59,330
me the opportunity for the next few days to get some Grotto Beast stuff situated because as of now

1918
07:03:59,330 --> 07:04:06,209
we're starting to kind of come out of this pre-sale period and there is a couple things to make sure

1919
07:04:06,209 --> 07:04:20,900
go off well. You'll see very soon. I'll see you guys on Friday. Thanks for watching. Friday,

1920
07:04:20,900 --> 07:04:25,380
Saturday, Sunday probably or at least starting on Friday and we're just going for however many

1921
07:04:25,380 --> 07:04:33,869
hours or days it takes to beat Resident Evil 4. And actually the next time you see me I might have

1922
07:04:33,869 --> 07:04:52,619
something interesting to tell you or show you perhaps. We'll see. Maybe. Soon. We'll see.

1923
07:04:52,619 --> 07:05:03,729
Maybe. Not guaranteed but maybe. Alright everybody, see you later. That's the wrong thing. Hey,

1924
07:05:03,729 --> 07:05:11,169
there it is. Thanks for the subs everybody. Thanks for watching. Thanks for supporting the stream.

1925
07:05:13,020 --> 07:05:17,869
Kind of unhinged today but I think Nancy Drew just kind of pulls that out of us,

1926
07:05:17,869 --> 07:05:31,150
me specifically. We'll see you again. I'm very excited for Resident Evil 4. It's getting really

1927
07:05:31,150 --> 07:05:35,229
great reviews although I mean it's a remake of the one that already got really great reviews

1928
07:05:35,229 --> 07:05:41,069
but this one's getting very good reviews too. Making a remake could have the opposite happen

1929
07:05:41,069 --> 07:05:47,040
where it's not as good as the original but apparently this is incredible. Most outlets

1930
07:05:47,040 --> 07:05:54,860
are giving this high nines even tens so I'm very very excited because I love the fourth game.

1931
07:05:54,860 --> 07:06:00,700
I've played through it many times at least three or four times many times. We'll see how it holds

1932
07:06:00,700 --> 07:06:12,689
up. I'm very excited. The Resident Evil 2 remake was incredible I'm sure. Yeah we talked about it

1933
07:06:12,689 --> 07:06:17,700
in the very beginning of the stream. It'd be kind of funny if because I gave Resident Evil 2 a remake

1934
07:06:17,700 --> 07:06:22,479
game of the year. It'd be funny if I give this it was just two remakes in three years getting

1935
07:06:22,479 --> 07:06:29,790
game of the year for me. Alright let's raid somebody. I want to you know what I want who I

1936
07:06:29,790 --> 07:06:55,939
want to raid. Let me bring up their stream. Let's get a raid going. I want to raid. Oh let me see.

1937
07:06:56,659 --> 07:07:07,569
I want to raid Seadog. Seadog VA. Seadog's currently doing a charity cycle-a-thon from

1938
07:07:07,569 --> 07:07:24,299
Nagasaki to Kumamoto. Big charity cycle-a-thon. Go say hello. Connor is an awesome dude. Seadog go

1939
07:07:24,299 --> 07:07:44,299
say hi. Charity liker. That's right. I'll see you guys later. Thanks for watching. Take care

1940
07:07:44,299 --> 07:08:03,580
yourselves. Bye bye. Oh also we've got a few coins to spare. The donation the goal right now is 150k.

1941
07:08:03,580 --> 07:08:13,220
It's currently at 132k. So if you got some spare coin you know where to put it. See you guys soon.

1942
07:08:13,220 --> 07:09:07,340
Take care. Hey you hey we can get this to 10k. We can get this to 10k. Let's get a 10k raid on

1943
07:09:07,340 --> 07:09:13,599
charity stream. Come on let's do it. We can get this to 10k. We can do it. Let's do it. We can get it to 10k.

1944
07:09:13,599 --> 07:09:28,900
Come on. Go go go go go go go go go go go go go. If we don't it's fine. Come on go in.

1945
07:09:34,659 --> 07:09:40,779
I think everyone just left already. It's all right. All right see you guys later. See you on Friday.

1946
07:09:40,779 --> 07:10:17,040
Have a great night. Take care of yourselves. Goodbye.
