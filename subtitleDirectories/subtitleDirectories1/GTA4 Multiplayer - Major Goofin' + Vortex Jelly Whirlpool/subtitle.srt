1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:13,259
Uh, Telix. Telix, me and you are the same exact character.

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,429
Well, we can't do this.

3
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:20,179
We are the exact same character.

4
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:22,179
Why? Why? Why are you me?

5
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:24,179
Why do we all have berets on?

6
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,179
Who is shooting at me? I-

7
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,179
Me and you are twin brothers.

8
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,179
Why do all three of us have berets?

9
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:32,179
We're like triplets.

10
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:36,359
Oh, hey, so how-

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,359
Why is he shooting at me?

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,659
Oh, I have a star.

13
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,670
My apologies.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,670
Oh, I was diced.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,299
I can't believe we're the same character.

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,299
Alright, get in this cop. This cop's gonna get the-

17
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,299
Quick, get in.

18
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,299
It's alright, it's Alex.

19
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:56,299
I don't think the cops want you.

20
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,299
This cop's gonna pull me out of the car.

21
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,299
What's with that rag, though?

22
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,299
You guys have to beat the cop.

23
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,299
Oh, no.

24
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,469
Let me in.

25
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,469
What?

26
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,469
Confirm this.

27
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:12,469
Are you wanted by the policeman?

28
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:14,469
Uh, no.

29
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:16,469
Okay, good.

30
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,469
Oh, my god.

31
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:21,290
I was trying to sandwich Alex right there.

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,290
Fortunately, it didn't work.

33
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,780
You're darn right it didn't work.

34
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
Are you throwing grenades?

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,780
No.

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,920
You made a grenade throwing motion.

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Yes, you are. Those are grenades.

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
You are throwing grenades.

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
How did Blue die?

40
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Get me out, get me out of the-

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I got ran over by a cop.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I am innocent.

43
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,099
Explosions everywhere.

44
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,099
Get me out of the-

45
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,099
I splattered and killed you.

46
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,640
I made it out.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I have three stars now.

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,420
I made it out alive.

49
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Wow, dude, you psycho.

50
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,370
What are you doing?

51
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,370
I'm going to get you.

52
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,370
What are you doing?

53
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,370
Get away from me.

54
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,370
Get away from me.

55
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,129
What are you talking about?

57
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:25,129
That was the scariest thing ever.

58
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,430
I jumped down here. I'm down here.

59
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,430
I'm trying to find you.

60
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
I'm going to over the top rope land on you.

61
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,800
What?

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,710
What?

63
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,710
Raymond Stereo from the Top Turnbuckle.

64
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,710
Right into Big Show's arms.

65
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,889
Get in the-

66
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,889
What the hell was that?

67
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:51,259
What's going on?

68
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,259
No, I don't want to get in the vaccine now.

69
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,259
Why is the car exploding?

70
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,259
Italics, are you shooting us from afar

71
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,259
with an explosive sniper rifle?

72
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,259
Who, me?

73
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,259
You son of a-

74
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,259
Explosions are italics.

75
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,259
Hey, I didn't kill you.

76
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,259
He's like posted up behind cover.

77
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,259
This is what I think of your cover.

78
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,259
Oh shit.

79
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,259
Oh.

80
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,620
I got to turn around.

81
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
We got to go around the way.

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,620
I got to try not to crash into a whole bunch of-

83
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,620
It looks like we went through a tunnel

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,620
and our arms broke in the tunnel.

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,500
Oh no.

86
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
What are you doing?

87
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Asshole.

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Let's do it in the cop car. That's more interesting.

89
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's get everybody in the car.

90
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm coming.

91
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,680
Hold off your trigger fingers.

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
I'm going to get killed first so I can take away my stars.

93
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Oh, what the hell? Why do we have three stars?

94
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,300
What happened?

95
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Oh, I did just get in the back of the car.

96
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
I have three stars right now.

97
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
We didn't do anything.

98
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,539
Okay, honest to God,

99
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,539
I really want to watch this back and see what the hell

100
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,539
we even did wrong.

101
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,539
I just shot a cop in the head like twice.

102
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,539
Alright, well let's turn this around.

103
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,360
All of us maybe

104
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
die and lose our stars.

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
I can't get in.

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
You don't have a wheel.

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Wait for me.

108
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
This car is so screwed up.

109
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,360
We're not getting any speed.

110
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
We're going so slow.

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
We're actually turning around and going the opposite direction.

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
There are only cop cars in the city.

113
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,839
This is like drive on PlayStation 1.

114
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,839
Here we go.

115
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,839
Yay.

116
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:50,470
Oh, that sucked.

117
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,470
My head hurts.

118
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,470
Parachute.

119
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,470
He came over the ramp.

120
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,300
You did it.

121
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Look at this drain. Look at this. What's going on here?

122
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,470
Are you getting sucked into a whirlpool?

123
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,220
Is that you?

124
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Dude, we are sucked into this

125
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,220
whirlpool vortex right now.

126
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Oh, it's like this terrain is

127
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,220
impossible to drive a motorcycle on.

128
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Why is this happening?

129
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
There's lots of dead cops stuck outside the drain.

130
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,220
Look towards the dots

131
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,790
on your minimap. Here we go.

132
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,790
We're coming. We're about to fly to the drain.

133
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,790
Yeah, me and Boo are inside this

134
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,220
piece of jello.

135
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Oh, wow.

136
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
I almost landed on one of the boats.

137
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,220
That's a pretty sick

138
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,220
jump. Alright, where's this drain?

139
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,220
Me and Boo are stuck in this

140
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,220
drain jello pudding.

141
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,449
I can't aim. My sensitivity is too high.

142
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:00,199
You can shoot?

143
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,199
Yeah, I'm still in this piece of crap.

144
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,199
Oh, what is this whirlpool?

145
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,199
It's a trampoline whirlpool.

146
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,199
What is this?

147
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,199
I was just standing on the bottom of the ocean

148
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,199
right there.

149
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,199
You can use your gun too.

150
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,199
Oh, man. This is...

151
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,199
I can't hit anybody.

152
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,569
Look at this guy. Look at this cop.

153
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, this is ridiculous.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You guys are in jello. What's going on?

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't aim. My sensitivity is too high.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've got an idea, guys.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I want to see if I can jump into that from the top.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm trying to get out. I got out.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,620
Stay down there where it's safe.

160
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,620
This is a helicopter.

161
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
I've got an idea. I'm sending down a life raft.

162
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,990
Oh, my God.

163
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,990
What are you jumping in?

164
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,990
Jumping in with a cop car is a life raft?

165
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,300
You know, it would really suck

166
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
if you'd land on top of my bonnet

167
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
and I would have drowned.

168
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Obviously, I would have been hurt

169
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
from the collision of you landing on me with a car.

170
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Oh, the helicopter is shooting me.

171
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
I have no stars. Get away.

172
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
No, no.

173
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
They shot my raft.

174
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Oh, my God.

175
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,050
Why did he do that?

176
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,610
A cop just jumped over the railing

177
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,610
and died in the water.

178
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,610
He dove in the water.

179
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,610
Why?

180
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,610
Why did he do that?

181
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,610
Did we lose our Jolo Whirlpool?

182
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,170
I think we did. Oh, my God.

183
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,170
What?

184
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,410
What?

185
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,860
Dude.

186
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Listen. Listen.

187
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
I tried to open the door of that car

188
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
and the guy was on, like, drugs.

189
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,860
He hit his arms.

190
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
His arms.

191
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
He's shooting me.

192
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
The cops are underwater.

193
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
I can't even explain

194
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,860
what just happened.

195
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
The guy was, like, shit-faced.

196
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
And then you plowed into me. He wouldn't get out of the car.

197
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
He would not get out of the car.

198
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
He was looking at me like

199
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
he was like...

200
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
Oh.

201
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Oh, I found a helicopter over here.
