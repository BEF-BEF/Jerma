1
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:24,280
Alright, I'm back. What's up? I got the music working again, aren't you happy?

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:37,509
Fucking better be. Alright, Street Fighter 6, let's go.

3
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:44,969
So I have to tell you, I need to make this very clear. I am not a fighting game player at all.

4
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,340
You've seen me play stuff like multiverses. But traditional fighting games, I don't play them.

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,909
I'm not really super into them. But Street Fighter 6 caught my eye for a few different reasons.

6
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:11,079
One of which is the single player mode. That is the reason why I bought this game,

7
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:18,549
is because of that. Does the title still make sense for this game? Don't adjust your TV set.

8
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:34,540
Yes, I'm actually playing. I guess that makes sense too, because why would I be playing this?

9
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:43,500
Alright, so I need to make a character and I apologize that it's probably going to take about

10
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:55,290
at least 30 minutes. I got no timer on this. The character creator is kind of ridiculous

11
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:10,280
from what I've seen. So let's go for it. You should see it right now. You should see it right

12
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,490
now. There we go. Alright, so what I want to do, I want to do this. This is World Tour.

13
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,849
Create an avatar and embark on a journey to discover the meaning of strength. Take the

14
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:34,979
plunge and experience the world of Street Fighter like never before. Let's go. You ready? Go.

15
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:55,430
I think I'll make Shikidian off of it. Make Miku? Well, let's get in there first.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,159
I'll turn it up.

17
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:20,169
Honestly, Capcom doesn't miss lately. Capcom doesn't miss. I don't know what happened.

18
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:32,439
What happened? Capcom doesn't miss anymore. That's kind of surprising. I know, yeah,

19
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:43,340
I said fuck Capcom that time, but it didn't mean it. I was in a fit of rage. I did say that.

20
00:03:43,740 --> 00:04:08,550
A couple years ago. Well, now it's love. Bless Capcom. Cool. You can remove screen shake in

21
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:24,490
this game. Already did it. Kids, take a breather. This is Buckler Security Services. I'm Luke,

22
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:35,029
the coach around you. New character, new character. Alright, here we go. What do I make?

23
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,079
A new you. Creating your avatar. Bring avatar for World Tour mode. It will also be used in the

24
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:50,970
Battle Hub. OK, I think I have to do this. The length of your limbs and size of your body matter

25
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:57,339
during battle. Having long limbs makes it easier. So I have to just have wicked long arms?

26
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:03,379
Make Golem? We have to live with this character for as long as I play this game.

27
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:27,029
We have to live with this. OK, presets. So where do we start? OK, wait, there's more.

28
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:45,860
Alright, I think I'm starting here. Oh, come on, don't. I think I have to start here. OK,

29
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:56,740
body preset. Moving the point of the triangle after making the settings for interview. OK,

30
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:16,040
so just telling me that it. OK, how big do I want to make this guy? I kind of like that.

31
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:27,910
That's a good start. We can change it after. Blend face. No, no, no. Light and proportions.

32
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:38,899
Well, that just doesn't look right. How tall is this? Sitting height where I could just

33
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:46,120
changing your height to the minimum or maximum. OK, so there's a certain value where it becomes

34
00:06:46,120 --> 00:07:16,519
kind of screwed up. Oh no. OK, I'm going to hate this after 10 minutes. Let's have a long ass

35
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:37,860
torso. All right, I think it's fine. Upper body. No, I could do neck length. So he said crash

36
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,300
bandicoot. OK, we're making crash bandicoot. We're making crash bandicoot. That is exactly

37
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:53,139
who this is going to be. Wow, that's what a great fucking comment. This needs to be up way higher.

38
00:07:53,139 --> 00:08:07,449
We've got to cover the head because we need to put crash bandicoot's face on his chest.

39
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:20,629
Oh, my God, you crash his voice. OK, um. Whoa, it's like that, right?

40
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:43,769
He's kind of like he looks like a flounder. No, no, no. I said big. Make the arms big.

41
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:54,419
How big a crash bandicoot's hands. They're actually kind of long. They go down this far.

42
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:05,529
These arms are way too thick, though. That's better. Shoulders are too thick. This is just a

43
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:11,929
Titan from Attack on Titan. Yeah, that's what everybody is making. OK, everybody is making an

44
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:17,610
Attack on Titan Titan. That's what every person you've seen play this game does. There are no

45
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:36,100
normal people made with this. No one. Not a single person is making normal people. Abdomen bulge.

46
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:49,509
OK, hold on. Sometimes when you stare at your face long enough, wonder if that beauty mark's

47
00:09:49,509 --> 00:10:11,110
always been there. Forehead protrusion. Eyebrow spacing. OK, that looks fine. Brow depth. I like

48
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:44,440
the higher brows. Surprised or angry? Angry for sure. 100%. Yeah, this is all right so far. Along

49
00:10:44,440 --> 00:11:09,100
to the jobby. That's a lot of neck. That's mostly neck. Oh my goodness. With a huge underbite. All

50
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:25,190
right. Jaw shape. This kind of has to fill into the neck a little bit. Maybe not. No, pull it back.

51
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:46,950
That's fine. OK, cool. Hair. I actually kind of like this one. OK, it might be this one too.

52
00:11:47,509 --> 00:12:20,730
Oh my goodness. All right. Is it just a middle part? That's good too, though. Oh, that's really

53
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:50,870
good. That's good too. OK, wait, I need hair color. Am I fucking this up? Is it red? Does it have

54
00:12:50,870 --> 00:13:06,679
wicked shiny hair? Wait, how many colors can I do? Why is it red? Why is it just getting redder?

55
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:24,980
Am I mixing the colors together? Hair color one. OK, there we go. All right, that's fine.

56
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:49,179
Oh, color mixing. There it is. All right, that's fine with me. Eye shape. All right, we have to put

57
00:13:49,179 --> 00:14:19,139
the eyes down really low. OK, that looks fine. Eye size. Wait, what did I just do? No, no. How

58
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:45,340
do I? Oh, right here. OK, I like the big eyes. Intensity. Whoa. OK, that's cool. Do we just give

59
00:14:45,340 --> 00:15:11,299
them undertaker eyes? OK, yep. I like it. When somebody with blue eyes looks at you.

60
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:47,179
You make them bright. Oh, no, too bright. OK, lashes. Just no eyelashes. I'm thinking no

61
00:15:47,179 --> 00:16:14,840
eyelashes at all. No eyebrows either. And no eyebrows and no eyelashes. OK, here we go. This

62
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:24,789
is where we start to really make the face the face. I don't like this at all, but I guess we're

63
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:42,179
living with it. Now I want to go and zoom into his face. This dude's hitboxes are going to be so

64
00:16:42,179 --> 00:17:25,700
fucked. Oh, that's right. Oh, well, the nostrils are all the way down here. OK. OK, I think I'm

65
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:41,990
all right with this. All right. Mouth position. Probably all the way down. Right. I want the I

66
00:17:41,990 --> 00:18:02,740
want the lower. Oh, that's all right. Mouth corners. No, happy for sure. That's terrifying.

67
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:40,119
OK, that's fine. I think that looks good. All right. Facial hair. That's all right. My goodness.

68
00:18:41,430 --> 00:19:13,460
Wow. That's long. Wow. That one's great, too. Holy shit. OK, I Gandalf. We need new hair then.

69
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:23,079
If this is Gandalf or this is, you know, we need new hair and hair is Gandalf have.

70
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:50,099
I guess it's kind of like this. Why is it so like, oh, it's the there we go. OK, he's way too

71
00:19:50,099 --> 00:20:13,690
fucked up. You know what I mean? A lower body. We can fix everything. All right. Hold on. Huge

72
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:32,920
waist. No, no, no, no. Huge pelvis. Oh, no. It looks like a refrigerator. All right. I'll keep it.

73
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:46,380
I'll keep it. I'll keep it. We need to make them as square as possible. Oh, yeah. 100 percent.

74
00:20:46,380 --> 00:21:15,880
No, everything has to be the same. Oh, my God. What? Why? Oh, this is too. This is too much. OK.

75
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:44,099
What else we got? Muscle definition. Wait, metallic, metallic. I can just be shining.

76
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:55,720
That's going to be so annoying to look at. No, I'm sorry. I mean, that's pretty damn cool,

77
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:23,529
though. I mean, that's pretty cool. Maybe not so metallic. That looks good. Oh, hair quality one

78
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:43,480
or two. We're going to have some back hair. OK, I think. Oh, you are kind of. All right. Wait a

79
00:22:43,480 --> 00:23:02,730
minute. Sitting height. This has to be, I think, as long as possible. OK, he's kind of a piece of

80
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:16,329
toast. He's like a piece of bread. OK, I'm happy with this so far. Body paint.

81
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,900
Oh, I can get. I don't need that. What do I have here?

82
00:23:34,539 --> 00:24:00,150
OK. All right. Hold on. It's it's got to be. OK, how about this one? Is this one cool? I don't know.

83
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:32,250
Nice one piece character that you made through. Oops. What do I do? Oh, shit. I screwed it up.

84
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:50,420
Um, what am I? What is this? I don't know what setting. Oh, it's my lips. OK, this is a mold.

85
00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:02,069
Then how do I get? I want to take that off. Shit. How do I get this off? There we go. OK.

86
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:16,309
OK. Body hair color. Yeah, we did this already. All right. Voice. Let me hear those vocal. See

87
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:21,269
what you've got. Put on a good show. Let's see what you've got. Let's see how you do.

88
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:32,410
See what you've got. Think you can take me. Here I go. This one's good. You got the skills.

89
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,410
Let's put on a good show. Let's see what you've got. Let's see what you've got.

90
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:50,440
Oh, that's a good one. That was somebody getting trapped in a combo.

91
00:25:50,680 --> 00:26:03,940
Let's see what you've got. I like that one. Play the game. Relax. I am not to be trifled with.

92
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:21,539
This is half the game right here. I like it. OK, current recipe. Download recipe. No, I just

93
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:32,069
know I'm ready. I think we're good. I think we're good. Forget your name either.

94
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:43,660
Flatline Greg. It's going to be his name. Give me your Sunday best. OK.

95
00:26:43,660 --> 00:27:09,539
OK, sounds good to me. What do I have to do? Take a look. Let's go. Oh, goodness.

96
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:21,140
Honestly, the people that make normal characters, you have a lot of mental fortitude.

97
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:31,900
The mental fortitude it takes to not make your characters nose four or five inches off of their

98
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,579
face is incredible. I can't believe that you're able to do that. All right. How do we play Street

99
00:27:38,579 --> 00:28:01,690
Fighter? OK. All right. Yep. There are three movement speeds. It just doesn't fit at all in

100
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:16,579
this entire universe. I hate this character already. His head is too small. I'm going to

101
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:23,460
know. I'm not going to. I'm going to hate it. OK. Press A, B, X, Y while holding right bumper

102
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,529
allowing you to control the camera even while using a controller that has no right stick.

103
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:51,579
All right. Well, that's fine. Great. Operate the camera. Use right stick. Easy. It's for arcade

104
00:28:51,579 --> 00:29:01,619
stick. OK. You look like a door. Show me how you are with your fists. All right. There are two

105
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,500
control schemes for battles in World Tour mode. Modern and classic. Cool. Modern is a four button

106
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:16,359
layout that allows players to enjoy a more freeform approach to combat. Modern is the only control

107
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:22,630
type available in World Tour during Chapter one. OK. So it's not. I looked into this a little bit.

108
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,779
Yeah. So it's light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, special move. I get it. Might as well.

109
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:47,670
Yep. Holding back is blocking, right? All right. I punched. I did it. Jump three times. I know how

110
00:29:47,670 --> 00:30:12,470
to do that. Up. Nice. You should just do modern. I probably will just do modern. Crouch. Don't. The

111
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:19,769
beard physics are way too distracting. Yeah, but we have to live with it. It's fine. OK.

112
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:33,980
Light, medium, heavy. Yep. Tackle jumping multiple times. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. OK.

113
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:40,839
Three special attacks. So these are special moves like a duken, but you don't have to do like

114
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,599
down, left, down, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, square, left, right, square. Right.

115
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:51,259
You actually just press one button. I actually like that a lot. So I'm sorry if I'm a casual

116
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:59,299
apologize in advance. OK. So it's just in a direction and that it's like somebody

117
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:14,519
said it's like Smash Brothers, huh? OK, cool. Oh, that's the point of modern. Go throw Luke

118
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:32,380
three times left trigger if you're using modern control scheme. Oh, modern's fine. Yeah, I'm not

119
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:38,539
worried about it. I'm not really a fighting game player, but that means I can have fun, too. Cool.

120
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:46,470
Can you play with a modern style online? That's how the basics are. Simple and do you have to

121
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,430
go against other modern players? Even the biggest rockets need a stable launching pad for takeoff

122
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:58,539
or else they're just going to crash and burn. You get me? Coach, how is any of that? No. Interesting.

123
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:10,700
You do less damage with it. Modern and classic can play each other. They're intended to be balanced

124
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:19,130
to both are viable. That's cool. All right. We might have to take the beard off. It's actually

125
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:29,349
is way too distracting. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Decrease every year. Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:32:29,349 --> 00:33:05,140
Declare victory. Decrease. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. I can't believe you got hit in the tutorial.

127
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:17,180
Modern does less damage. Really going to be the type to jump before you think. Coach, that was

128
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,680
the kind of situation I want to learn to deal with. You're not here to punch bags either, right?

129
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:37,500
This is fun. He signed up with the same regimen you are. When does he play golem? I already did.

130
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:49,859
I already gave it a rating too. It was a 5.3. Golem is a 5.3. No, actually it's like a 4.8.

131
00:34:03,829 --> 00:34:11,610
That's generous. That's way too high.

132
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,039
You can cross that bridge when you get to it. You two are still my plucky little trainees.

133
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:29,559
Give it a one. Listen to what your coach says and put your hearts into your training. Game was 60

134
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:35,929
bucks. Oh, it was. Oh my God. I completely didn't take. I did not even take that into

135
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:50,710
consideration. I just death stared. You wanted something more. That was a you're dead at some

136
00:34:50,789 --> 00:35:21,340
point in this story. I'm going to kill you. New content. Billionaire streamer does not care

137
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:31,829
about the price. No, I told you I did. That's why I was like, wait, that's true.

138
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:38,360
I cannot wait to play this. Those of you that don't know why I'm excited about a street fighter

139
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,880
game when it's like, when does he ever cared about this? It's this game mode and just wait,

140
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:53,639
that ass is huge. It was distracting. Holy shit. Okay. What was I? I don't remember what I was

141
00:35:53,639 --> 00:36:29,300
saying. It's open world and you can just kind of fight anybody. It seems really cool. Your

142
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:42,860
character fits right in. I don't know about that. Oh God. Those feet looked like cactuses.

143
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:56,940
They look like cactus. What was going on there? Actual hands-on experience on the streets.

144
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:05,030
Beating up the bad guys around here should do the trick. Sorry. Did the joke fly over your head?

145
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,920
At any rate, I was told this would point us toward our next steps. Oh, hang on a minute. I'm getting

146
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:18,489
a message from coach. There's an app on your device. Check it out. You get anything? You view

147
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:26,949
all sorts of information by pressing. Cool. Okay. You can view messages sent to your device by

148
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:33,719
selecting messages. Luke, let's get you started with some missions. Sending you training exercises

149
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:45,829
to the missions app. Check it out and follow any instructions that pop up there. Missions. New kid

150
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,550
on the block. Welcome to the streets where you go and what you do is entirely up to you. But if you

151
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,070
like to get a feel for how things are and usually done somewhere, there's no quick way than asking

152
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:04,519
the locals. Look for a person named Alice. She'll show you the ropes. Let's go. Basically, it's a

153
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:12,900
to-do list. The first thing we need to do is talk to that person right over there. That should be

154
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:24,820
easy. Let's get going. Your mission destination is denoted by a red mark. Try making your way to the

155
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:34,699
destination using the mark as your guide. Yep. This person's level nine. What level am I?

156
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,980
What do you think of my performance? Exciting, right? When you're performing, what matters most

157
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,659
is technique, tempo, and a mindset that practically commands onlookers to behold.

158
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,960
It's Lucifer. With that in mind, I'm going to teach you a pose to harness that very same mental

159
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:08,570
fortitude. Emote acquisition item. Check me out. Okay. Now that's a mindset you can set your watch

160
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:21,030
to. It all hinges on how you're feeling, friend. All right, let's do this. Alice. And you two must be

161
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:27,460
a couple of rookies who just want to get stronger. I take it. Right on the money. How did you know

162
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:34,710
it was us? Seriously, come on. It's practically written on your faces. That would have been four

163
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:44,139
dollars in gold. He asked me to assist with your training for a bit. Your little mission to come

164
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:48,940
talk to me was a smashing success. Next up, how about we have ourselves a fight? Okay. Don't hold

165
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:59,179
anything back now. I'm a lot stronger than you two. Okay. Plan 10 hits. When playing using the modern

166
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:03,900
control scheme, assisted combos can be before it by keeping right trigger pressed while attacking.

167
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:09,300
And then attack with right trigger X or right trigger A. And you can follow up with a combo

168
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:38,099
by simply repeating the button press. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, I see. So you hold right trigger.

169
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:45,829
It's Luigi mode. That's fine. You're getting one of the first to get to level 100 in Diablo 4.

170
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,500
I played a little bit of Diablo 4. I have a few thoughts on it. Can't give you my total opinion

171
00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:01,590
of the game so far, but what I can tell you is this. So I find it funny. And I don't know why.

172
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:07,989
A lot of games have been doing this, I think, nowadays. But maybe minor spoilers for Diablo

173
00:41:07,989 --> 00:41:11,909
4. If you don't want to hear it, just mute and come back in 30 seconds. But they'll tell you

174
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:21,960
something. Okay. Ready? Here comes spoilers for it. Three, two, one. Oh, you just missed her.

175
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,760
Oh, Lilith was just passed through this town and she would fucked a bunch of stuff up.

176
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Oh, you missed her. And you go to the next town. Oh, you just missed it. She was here and she ate

177
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,840
somebody and then she killed three people. At the next town, I feel like she might be going there

178
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:47,000
and you walk to that town. Oh, you just missed Lilith. She was here. She stole one of our swines.

179
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,440
She stole one of our pigs. And then it's like we've been, I don't know, we're kind of just

180
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:03,829
walking and chasing Lilith. And at some point, there's even a sequence where, and spoilers,

181
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:09,940
we're still talking spoilers. You end up going to this place and it's like, oh, I know where she

182
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,980
went. She went this way. Oh, we have to chase her. She went to the next spot. Oh, she's passed

183
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,579
through here. You end up coming back to that town and it's leveled like shit. She actually fucking

184
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:35,050
came back. Why is he spoiling? I just told you we're talking Diablo four spoilers. That's the

185
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:40,809
entire Diablo two storyline. I think the reason why I don't mind it in the Diablo two storyline

186
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:47,449
is because you only get to hear that like three times total, not every new town you go to.

187
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,460
Do you know what I mean? There are a lot of towns in Diablo four and it's almost like, oh,

188
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:02,809
yeah, this is town number 15. Where'd she go? Find her. Follow the trail. Quick adventurer,

189
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:10,809
defend me while I open this door. I can read the runes. Oh, quick adventurer. Here they come.

190
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:28,969
I feel like that's happened quite a few times. But, but, but it's pretty fun. Yeah, it's fun.

191
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:37,860
But it's fun. I'm having fun with it. Street fighter. I thought you said street fighter four.

192
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,139
Whatever fucking game this is. Street fighter six. Somebody I I'm fucked up. I can't read what you

193
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:51,500
said. I have one other complaint about Diablo four and I'm going to give it to you right now.

194
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:59,500
All right, here we go. Yeah, call me stupid. Call me. Well, he needs like something explained to

195
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:08,380
him. There's a lot of if they're fours in Diablo four. There's a lot of like if this than that,

196
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:17,929
then this like lucky hit chance. If if somebody standing in your poison and then you do chilled

197
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:23,690
to them, then if there's lucky hit percentage going off, then 10% critical strike chance

198
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:31,769
will go up. It's like I like too many. What the fuck even does over what does overpower even do?

199
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:37,050
What does it even do? Well, you see, it's 3% chance to have your health and your fortification

200
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:46,789
combined data be used as a damage move. It's kind of confusing. Your brain is cooked eggs.

201
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:51,510
I'm sorry, but I don't want to look. I just want to hurt. I want to punch things.

202
00:44:52,150 --> 00:45:10,059
You need modern Diablo controls. I gave you my Diablo take. So you're saying stir was right.

203
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:24,329
I don't actually don't know stirs Diablo for take. I wonder what it is now. Nice microwave egghead.

204
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:33,219
OK, when you when you get a legendary that drops and you look at it and you you need to read.

205
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:40,539
I didn't even know what lucky hit did until I was like fucking level 25. I wonder what and even

206
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,300
still I read up on it. I'm like, what the fuck is that? What does that even mean? What's happening?

207
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:58,440
All right, fight and beat two people. Here we go. He does need modern controls.

208
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,119
Oh, here he goes. Here he goes. He's here. He goes. Let's fight Hugo.

209
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:22,170
Hugo, you can use items during battle. OK, I don't need items to fight a level one.

210
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:36,230
I love this guy was just probably on his way to work. Stop jumping. Yeah.

211
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,659
That would be so weird. Try fight the level nine.

212
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,420
All right. Is the level nine going to kick the shit out of me? I'm going for it.

213
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:23,429
I'm barely hurting this guy, but every straight fighter thing I've ever seen is just keep the

214
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:43,429
person over here. Just keep them over on this corner. It's not fighting back.

215
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:57,500
Why is he not fighting? He's not fighting. Why is he not attacking me? Is this a stream sniper? No,

216
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:11,059
it. Oh, no, it's not a stream sniper. Don't you have to like juggle people to in these games?

217
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:31,480
All right. Well, there it is. Are there damage numbers?

218
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:39,659
Sturer said the campaign is the worst he's ever played in any a RPG, but the gameplay loop is

219
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:50,099
pretty fun if shallow. Really? Oh, you level up, right? Right, right, right, right. OK,

220
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:56,199
you gain skill points upon leveling up if you access the status app in your device and choose

221
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:16,949
skills. Oh, he said stirs stir of liked anthem. So, oh, what do I do? Where's my where's my phone

222
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:33,400
settings? Emotes and shortcuts, standard emotes. Oh, I got check me out. OK, cool.

223
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:43,670
Where did I level up? Customize your device can be personalized by changing your wallpaper.

224
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:53,989
Let's do blue. Looks good. Items status. Maybe check your styles and equipment gear.

225
00:49:53,989 --> 00:50:01,860
I don't think I have any gear. Luke's style is the only one I have. OK, I don't.

226
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:09,449
Ah, this is where you change moves. All right. Well, I only have two.

227
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:18,139
Here we go. Skills. You level up. Cool. Carries over. You would like to redo how you've unlocked.

228
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:23,449
OK. All right. So we got increases the row strength. Yep. I'm just going to be a throw Andy.

229
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:38,380
I'm going to be unfucking bearable. Punch. Not like wasting points, am I? Cool. All right. Who

230
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:46,679
holds their phone like that? I did what you asked. Gotten a feel for fighting yet? Nothing beats

231
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,530
trying it for yourself. When you're out and about, not everyone you run into will go easy on you.

232
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,590
So if you're going to start a fight with somebody, pick your opponent wisely. Anyway,

233
00:50:55,590 --> 00:51:07,420
I'll catch you two again sometime. OK, sometimes you got to talk to folks on the street and ask

234
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,900
them for a fight. Think of it like saying hi on the streets. Only lots more punching.

235
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,260
And if all that punching works up an appetite, go ahead and get yourself a bite.

236
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:21,820
There's a food truck nearby. You'd never guess from the look of it, but they do a killer pizza.

237
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:27,960
Pizza. Eating food is part of our training, too. Is coach just messing with us?

238
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:50,780
Let's do what he says. OK. Let's go, motherfucker. I want a free pizza.

239
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,860
Pepino. Watch out. That's funny. Yeah, he's not fighting either.

240
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:42,300
Look like the Beast Titan. He does look like the Beast Titan. Nice. All right. I just beat the shit

241
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:51,059
out of the pizza restaurant guy. Is that a bad thing? There's an X now. Is that bad?

242
00:52:55,289 --> 00:53:03,670
All right, now we're just going to eat. OK, there are two types of food used immediately

243
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,550
and food used during battle. Food lineup changes from time to time. So check your map

244
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:16,260
screen to see what's on the menu. What the hell am I looking at? It's always pizza.

245
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:25,239
Pizza covered in asparagus and. Oh, no, no, no, no asparagus on pizza.

246
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:43,559
No, we get pepperoni. I ate it. This is not the kind of food that athletes like this eat

247
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:54,090
every day. It says clearly like cheating or something. How do you compete with cheese?

248
00:53:54,090 --> 00:54:05,670
This hot and gooey as they do. What I tell you, bomb pizza, huh?

249
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,949
All pizza is good pizza, but the pepperoni gets my vote any day.

250
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:11,750
Ever run low on stamina, eating something will get you right back on your feet.

251
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:16,630
Some food will have you hitting harder, moving faster, the works. Food can power you up in all

252
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:21,099
kinds of ways. So don't be shy about expanding your palate. Now that you're done filling up,

253
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:25,500
why don't you pay a visit to that nearby alley? I could be an actor. I could be an actor. I could

254
00:54:25,500 --> 00:55:04,500
be an actor. OK, go to that alley. OK, by the way, that pizza was fucking gross. One move, Andy.

255
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:20,420
Whoa, what's going on? Why is he? I'm disintegrating him. He's being fucking

256
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:45,940
pulled out of the universe. What's wrong with them? Level up. What are you looking at? Oh,

257
00:55:45,940 --> 00:56:23,800
shit. Who's next? You're beating up a granny. What the hell are you doing? Piece of shit.

258
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:43,880
I'm smurfing. What does it look like? Oh, I can put points in. I have six points.

259
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:59,750
I'll do Max Vitality. Oh, it's all right. What was the other one? Defense. It's kind of the same

260
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:07,110
thing, just different ways, right? This is more complicated than Diablo for his skill tree.

261
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:35,449
Oh, oh, I'm in a fucking weird mood today. I'm sorry. I haven't streamed in like two weeks.

262
00:57:35,449 --> 00:57:40,650
I need to wait to give my full opinion on D4. Look, I'm one of those people and I'm sorry about

263
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:50,219
this. I apologize. No, this is how I feel. Fuck it. Diablo 2 came out and nothing can ever compare

264
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:56,619
and look, oh, you're old and oh, yeah, everything can't be as good. Rose colored glasses. Shut the

265
00:57:56,619 --> 00:58:02,219
fuck up. Right. I get it. But honestly, I don't think they can even come close ever again. I

266
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:06,460
don't think anybody could come close ever again. Nobody could ever come close ever again. It's

267
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:20,260
just unfortunate. It's the way it is. I'm playing Diablo 4 right now and having fun.

268
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:29,909
I'm like I'm having fun, too. I didn't say I didn't like it. I didn't say it wasn't good.

269
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,420
That's backtracking. No, I just told you that I need to like I need to play it more to get like

270
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:41,079
a real opinion. It's like a fucking 700 hour campaign or however long it is. That map is huge.

271
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:46,539
Wait, when getting into battles in the city, you find yourself against multiple opponents at once.

272
00:58:47,340 --> 00:59:05,590
Okay, well, it's like 2v2. All right, this is interesting. Well, that guy was these guys were

273
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:28,199
weak. A giant Capcom symbol. Hello, you two. We meet again. Let me introduce you to my brothers,

274
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:34,489
Tracy and Ryan. Luke asked us to give you a hand with your training. You know, get the whole family

275
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:41,369
on board kind of deal. Hold on. Someone's someone's calling me out here. I got to read it. You don't

276
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:46,010
like Diablo 2 because it's better than the new games. You like it because you did it when you

277
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,969
were a teenager after school instead of getting yelled at for doing it wrong by like 10,000 people.

278
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:54,170
You can never go back to the mind you had the first time you played it.

279
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:08,760
That's like, that's a good point. You know what I mean? That's true. The skill points that needs

280
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,360
to I don't know, there should be more of them. I don't like the five skill points that add like

281
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:20,710
2% damage. I just gave me more of that. I can't give you an opinion until I beat it. I need to

282
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:27,059
give you a real opinion. Diablo 2 is probably number one ever of all time ever for me. I love

283
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:31,699
that franchise. I love it. Give me some time to give you a real opinion on it. Because I don't

284
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:37,079
know it could be much more in depth than I'm giving it credit for. He wants 10 skill points

285
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:49,429
with 1% damage. It's not what I said. We're imitating the thugs around here. They hide

286
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:53,510
their faces just like this. They're attacking folks left and right. So be careful out there.

287
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:06,420
They're random battles. That's funny. Okay, I can't give you an opinion gives an opinion. Well,

288
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:16,659
that's my in in process opinion. Right? That's my like review in whatever they call it.

289
01:01:16,659 --> 01:01:24,380
Review in progress. There you get attacked on site. Their names are colored red. That's okay.

290
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:35,579
And the street will bring the fight to you. Bust out the self defense. Trust me, there are some

291
01:01:35,579 --> 01:01:41,639
places you do not want to wander around unless you have got the chops. Okay. See the sign for

292
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:55,659
the apparel store. I want you to do something. Do some shopping there. Okay. New clothes. He's a

293
01:01:55,659 --> 01:02:10,199
fast texter. It's all about the fight. Okay. Buy clothing. Do I have enough money to buy clothing?

294
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:24,550
Cool. All right. I want a pair of jeans. This is the only thing that's available.

295
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:46,650
This is the only thing I can buy is this hat. Okay. Well, all right. We both have the same hat.

296
01:02:47,289 --> 01:03:07,860
Are you going to kill five boars already? Cringe incoming. What do you mean cringe incoming?

297
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:23,139
Talking about me? Cringe, cringe, cringe. What's going on? Chop till you drop.

298
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:26,579
Doesn't even matter if you're the fashionable type, to be honest.

299
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:30,309
A little bit of attention to your outfit can make all the difference in a fight.

300
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:34,659
And hey, doesn't it feel good when you find out that outfit just speaks to you?

301
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:39,619
Cool. Let's wrap things up for the day. I'm wandering around the city as we speak.

302
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:58,889
See if you can find me. Okay. His ass is reading. What? He's not playing. He's not really playing.

303
01:03:58,889 --> 01:04:12,250
What are you? Yes, I am. Hi. How's the city treating you? Getting some practical experience

304
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:17,349
on the streets? Coach, are we really getting stronger by running around like this? Doubting

305
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:23,780
the wisdom of old Luke Sensei, are you? Let's see where you're at then. Don't worry about taking

306
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:30,409
turns. Both of you. Let's go. All right. Let's go. I'm going to jump. I'm going to jump, kick,

307
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:35,449
only grab. You do grabs only. Jump, kick, only grabs. Grabbing, grabbing, grabbing, grabbing.

308
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:59,699
Grab. I thought that guy in the back was about to jump in and punch us. Nice. Rising up for cut.

309
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:17,289
What are you going to do? Shit. Get in there and you do something. Oh my God. I keep getting caught.

310
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:42,099
God damn it. Level 10. Do you know how to block? This is a, you're supposed to lose this. You hold

311
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:48,099
back to block. I know how to block. I played Street Fighter one when you were, when you were

312
01:05:48,099 --> 01:06:15,800
in a crib. Okay. I played Street Fighter one when you were in a crib. He's crying. It was a bad voice

313
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:27,239
crack. It's okay though. You just got to take it one step at a time. Yeah. I got to get rid of

314
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:39,289
this beard. That first step you both took just now, it's something to be proud of. Man, you two are

315
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:58,900
great students. Okay. Enrolled. We did it. You became Luke's student. You can now use his master

316
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:07,980
action. Becoming the student of a legendary fighter, let's grant you access to their style,

317
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,699
which you can turn, in turn use in battle. Each style includes moves specific to that

318
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:15,900
legendary fighter. Seek out legendary fighters and find a style that works for you.

319
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:21,590
Unique attacks are normal moves that possess special properties. How many you have and what

320
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:27,260
they do depends on which master's style you're using. Attacks can be performed by using the left

321
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:31,900
stick and an attack button together. But if you'd rather not worry about doing them accidentally,

322
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:37,420
you can always remove them from your move list altogether. Just keep in mind that they're all

323
01:07:37,420 --> 01:08:00,570
usable by default. I have to read it. I have to know what I'm doing. You got a grade four reading?

324
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:11,050
Go watch my sorcery playthrough. You tell me how good I am at reading and dictation.

325
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:16,939
Then the two of you can go and travel the world. You can really get to know each other

326
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:27,189
and take on all comers. Seriously, you'll have a blast. Speaking of which, I'm sorry. I can't.

327
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:34,010
I need to be strong and I need to be it now. I'm not like you. I can't go around treating

328
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:41,300
this like a game. Bosh. Come on coach. I'm done with the course. Look at that hat on.

329
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:48,250
Things I need to take care of. But you're right. This did give me some confidence. Thank you.

330
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:52,520
My fight ended in a draw. Wish we could have had a rematch.

331
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,640
The cinematographer hates this character and never line up a shot correctly.

332
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:11,369
It's always going to look wrong. I think he was hacking at Bosh. Chasing after his strength in

333
01:09:11,369 --> 01:09:16,569
a mad rush is a recipe for disaster. Let's just hope he doesn't stumble down any weird rabbit holes.

334
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:22,180
You know, to be honest, I don't consider myself much of a teacher.

335
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,119
Rez said I was too much of a hothead and had me teach new students to help chill me out a bit.

336
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:32,439
I'm giving it the old college try, but maybe my methods could use a little work.

337
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:39,640
Maybe that does it for today's lesson. I'll contact you using this sucker moving forward.

338
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:45,159
Ah, that's right. If you see Alice tell her I said thanks for helping out with the lesson plan.

339
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:50,340
Yeah. She's got a ton to teach you. So I hope you two don't beat each other up too much.

340
01:09:56,180 --> 01:10:15,699
Nah, nah. All right. Yeah, not that impressive. I beat this guy's ass 10 minutes ago.

341
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:28,789
Came all the way over here just to thank little old me. Come on. It's been my pleasure.

342
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:37,640
Your character sucks ass. Start over. No. Guys, this is like Elden Ring.

343
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:46,199
I'm going to make like 15 characters eventually, right? I'm going to get my first move in Elden

344
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:51,180
Ring and just be like, nah, fuck this. I'm doing something else. I'm playing. It's like I'm doing

345
01:10:51,180 --> 01:11:05,220
pyromancy. Never mind. You're not touching this game after the stream. Oh, yeah. What a pull up.

346
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:14,340
What a pull up. Will I play this game again after today? Yes or no. What a pull up. Let's put your

347
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:27,130
money where your mouth is. Let's see it. Yeah. Now cut to me. Cut to me at Evo. I've been screaming.

348
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:34,310
The crowd is fucking electric and there's a thumb cam down on my controller. Just like

349
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:44,569
everyone stands up. Everyone's standing and I flawless victory every opponent.

350
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:55,319
Well, I'm not going to do that, but it'd be fun. Strength is something we all must find on our own

351
01:11:55,319 --> 01:12:09,350
and in order to find it, you've got to talk to people just like you're doing now. Okay. Legends.

352
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,399
Take my style. For example, I learned it from a fighter named Chun Li.

353
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:17,720
If you're looking for a guidepost towards strength to call your very own,

354
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,279
be well worth heading to Chinatown to meet with Chun Li and learn her style.

355
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:37,590
Actually, we had another raid. Yeah, I didn't even see it. I was too busy talking about

356
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:42,470
Captain Planet or something. That was Sips. Sips came in with the raid. I don't know how long

357
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:48,119
ago that was. 10 minutes maybe. But welcome. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody.

358
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:52,729
Points called miles are earned throughout the game by performing various actions.

359
01:12:53,659 --> 01:13:02,550
Ooh, whoa. Wow. The city can save a wealth of things to see and do. You can chat with the people

360
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:09,779
you meet, do part-time jobs for Zenny or even find rare items in the most unexpected of places.

361
01:13:09,779 --> 01:13:43,460
All right, let's go. I'm ready. All right. What do I do first? Let's go. Why does he keep? Why is he

362
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:55,989
only fighting pedestrians? This is a level five. It's not my fault that it's not my fault that

363
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:07,130
that character stinks. All right. What do I have? Items. Hard candy. You can lick your way to its

364
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:27,689
nutritious center. Oh, this is in battle. Oh, iron hard caramels. That sounds awful. Okay. So

365
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:46,619
we need to go to Chinatown. Okay. Break your teeth. Yeah. I can use the phone. Hey, you're

366
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:50,779
going to travel all over to get stronger from here on out, right? Probably as good a time as any to

367
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:57,109
take the bus. Chinatown's that away. Hard to miss its big gate. Anyway, good luck out there.

368
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:03,020
Okay. I'm getting a bus stop for the first time. It'll become available as fast travel location.

369
01:15:03,659 --> 01:15:07,020
I can view the map and your device will allow you to travel there. All right. So it's fast travel.

370
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:16,229
Cool. So make sure you unlock every bus stop. Okay. Wait, this Pete's over here.

371
01:15:16,789 --> 01:15:46,699
I have a car. Whoa. Fight the mime. Where's there a mime? Fight the mime. I don't see a mime.

372
01:15:47,260 --> 01:16:06,779
Where's this mime? Is a mime like the pizza guy again? No, I've already beaten him up twice.

373
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:23,880
Oh, here's the mime. Like, do people know what I'm about to do?

374
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:57,060
Do people just fight each other? Stop running away. The mime is not fighting. Oh,

375
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:37,539
the mime is talking. That's true. Oh, punish counter. Level six. Let's go. Okay. Earning

376
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:42,899
enough styles at EXP will cause that style's rank to increase. If you increase your style rank,

377
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:46,680
your master in that style might teach you new moves the next time you talk to them.

378
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:53,510
Oh, okay. While exploring the city, you may sometimes notice citizens with

379
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:59,109
master icons attached to them. These citizens are talented fighters who use the moves of that icon's

380
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:04,310
corresponding legendary fighter and will yield a large amount of style experience. Ooh. Okay.

381
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:28,680
Anybody have that? Who are you? No. What about you? No. Uppercut somebody. I missed. All right.

382
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:46,630
Let's go to Chinatown. So, where's the bus? How do I? How do I? Got a metro free pass? Yes. Oh,

383
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:53,510
I don't. So, this is now just a travel point. All right. So, how do I get to?

384
01:18:55,750 --> 01:19:24,579
I just walk, I guess. Can I get up there and fight these guys? That's terrifying. Oh, shit.

385
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:33,689
Watcher, I'm a hero. I protect the city from the shadows. I sense destiny in our meeting here.

386
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:42,090
Care to talk shop? And by shop, I mean justice? Yeah. Allow me to begin. There was once a young

387
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:49,289
man seeking strength. He traveled here to Metro City. On his first night, he went in search of

388
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:55,699
food to sate his empty stomach. But along the way, he encountered foul ruffians who stripped him of

389
01:19:55,699 --> 01:20:00,579
every of his possession. If the story ended there, it would be just another tale from the mean

390
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:06,760
streets of Metro City. But all my friend ended did not. A martial artist intervened, aiming to

391
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:13,060
strike down the rampaging ruffians. And strike them down he did. And they all lived happily ever

392
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:18,739
after, perhaps, had the story ended there. You see, the fighter chose to re-leave the gang members

393
01:20:18,739 --> 01:20:25,340
of their money. It was their reward for winning, you see. In that very moment, the young man had

394
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:32,569
an epiphany. Martial artists and gang goons are cut from the same cloth. Strike down evil is a

395
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:39,510
righteous act. All right, you want to go? That's not enough. One's reasons for striking down evil

396
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:43,979
and their sportsmanship afterward are equally important. When you raise your fist, you must

397
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:49,930
do so for just and meaningful purposes. You're a fighter, hmm? Is there meaning guiding your

398
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:57,420
fists? I don't know yet. Hmm, I see. You'll find a clear answer to that question in time, I imagine.

399
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:59,989
You must never forget to fight with a spirit of righteousness.

400
01:20:59,989 --> 01:21:01,270
Sorry for the trouble.

401
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:03,270
Ah, listen to me blabbing, I'm sorry about that.

402
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:07,079
Here it is. Thanks for listening to my story. No need to be shy now, take it.

403
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:17,689
Ooh, okay. Fully restore his vitality and drive gauge. Well, now I'm going to kick the shit out of

404
01:21:17,689 --> 01:22:06,710
you. Capcom, man! Back up. All right, this is bullshit, but it's working. All right, would I

405
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:22,680
get booed? Would I get booed if I was doing this in a tournament? Whoa, what happened? Oh, he

406
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:41,539
countered it. Not if it was working. A win is a win. Okay, yeah. Are there any diminishing returns?

407
01:22:42,100 --> 01:23:08,439
I'm going to level up like five times after beating this guy. Oh my God, what am I doing?

408
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:27,340
Am I actually going to level up a shitload of times? Uh oh, bad. This is bad. This is really

409
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:33,720
bad. I don't know what he's doing. Why did I go against, why did I go against the fucking formula?

410
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:37,939
Why did I do that? That was stupid. I could have beat him. I don't know why I got bored.

411
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:47,270
Let me continue. Somebody resident sleepered and I freaked out and had to punch him twice.

412
01:23:47,270 --> 01:24:08,220
I'm not even going to look at chat. God damn it. Whatever. Okay, well at least it shows them on the

413
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:31,720
map. I'll be back. What did I just do to that guy? Who am I fighting? Oh, it's 2v1. All right.

414
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:53,819
That was not even, that was simple. Nice. That looks awful. You were at the very bottom of the

415
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:57,500
bag of cheese and you were like, you know what? I already have the dough out and I already have the

416
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:08,699
sauce out. I have to, I have to make it work. There's like 15 strands of cheese left. Stop

417
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:13,899
being mean. I just don't like that. I don't like pizza like that. I have to have the perfect level

418
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:41,750
of, perfect level of cheese and sauce. 3v1. Oh shit. This guy's level 14 and 15. How am I

419
01:25:41,750 --> 01:26:02,579
going to beat this? I'm kind of doing it though. Is there another one? How many people are there

420
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:17,130
in this? That was pretty good. No. God damn it. I fucking knew it was going to hit me.

421
01:26:25,449 --> 01:26:40,359
Shit. Guess level 15. All right. I'm going to Chinatown. Oh, that's right. I have items.

422
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:45,689
I can take them in the middle of a fight, right? When are you going to play the actual game?

423
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:51,500
This is the game. Are you asking when I'm going to play multiplayer online matches?

424
01:26:53,560 --> 01:27:00,760
The hell? I don't know. This is what I wanted to play. What? So you can stream snipe me and

425
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:05,399
beat me in fucking 10 seconds. That's what you want. That's why you want me to do that.

426
01:27:08,229 --> 01:27:12,920
You're sitting there hovering over the join match button. It's like, Oh, help I get queued up with

427
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:35,140
them so I can literally do one combo and kill them. Of course you can fight with your creator

428
01:27:35,140 --> 01:28:11,609
characters. That's awesome. I'll definitely do it. IRL street fighter. Whoa. I'm disappointed in you.

429
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:29,779
It's on Lee. Could I get a selfie? Just real quick, real quick. Sorry for the trouble involved.

430
01:28:29,779 --> 01:28:52,300
I'm Chunlin. Is there something I can help you with? Teach me. It actually, there actually is

431
01:28:52,300 --> 01:29:03,510
a selfie system. That's funny. Okay. I had a long career as a fighter myself, faced all kinds of

432
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:08,710
opponents that includes seriously powerful foes and friends forged in the fires of competition.

433
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:17,220
I'm apparently uninterested after all these years of fighting. I decided it might be time for break.

434
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:22,020
So I'm here teaching the locals Kung Fu. I can't promise it will provide you with the strength

435
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:42,680
you're looking for, but I happen to teach you a thing or two. Okay. This really is just a random

436
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:48,579
character. Every button was pressed and randomized. There was no thought that went into this at all.

437
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:32,020
All right. Oh, not good enough. Not good enough. Wow. So epic.

438
01:30:39,220 --> 01:31:01,659
All right. So now I can use Chun Li's moves. Ooh, spinning bird kick. So you have,

439
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:14,939
you can only use a certain style at once. You can't combine moves. Okay. Oh, wait, no. All right.

440
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:26,489
Ooh. So I can combine them. Oh, shit. That's actually pretty cool. All right. So let me do

441
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:48,310
that. Special moves. So do I want rising uppercut or do I want the flash knuckle? I think I want

442
01:31:48,310 --> 01:32:07,770
the range. I want this. I like this move. All right. So this is forward and this is just standard.

443
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:32,619
Okay. Let's try it. Let's go. All right. How do I do it? How do I do it? Whoa. How do I just do that?

444
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:57,289
Am I missing something? Hold back and then forward. Back, forward. Back, forward. Back, forward.

445
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:07,850
Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Forward special.

446
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:27,220
Forward Y. Forward Y. What's happening here? Do I have to charge it for a bit? Oh, that was weird.

447
01:33:27,779 --> 01:33:40,949
How did I just do that? Yeah, but I'm on modern controls. Okay. Hold on. Let me go. Wait.

448
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:55,369
Back, forward. Yeah, but isn't it modern? Oh, hold back, press Y. Hold forward, press Y.

449
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:08,539
It's just forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. How's it not working? Hold forward Y.

450
01:34:08,539 --> 01:34:16,949
I'm just, I'm doing it. Hold back and press special. It's not doing it either.

451
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:31,319
I don't even know how the fuck I just did that. I just tried, I tried every single combination.

452
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:37,579
Hold for one second then forward Y. I did that like probably 30 times in a row.

453
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:53,020
I don't understand what's going on. You weren't holding back for long enough.

454
01:34:53,020 --> 01:35:09,750
How come I'm all the way back here? Where's the moves list? I'm so far away.

455
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:32,869
Charge inputs are not easy. I wasn't, I wasn't holding back long enough. I'll figure it out.

456
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:41,079
Okay. You can check who you're studying. Got it. All right. Let me try this again.

457
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:54,899
One. Okay. Holding one. I'm holding back. Forward Y. Hold forward, back Y. Don't move at all. Press Y.

458
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:06,859
Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Forward, back Y. Down, back Y.

459
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:39,720
One, two, three, forward Y. I don't get it. Press Y while holding forward. That's what I'm doing

460
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:45,560
right now. All right. I, I, what just happened right there? Hold Y. Forward. Okay. It's, you have,

461
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,600
it's only, it's only walking forward. It's walk forward for two seconds and then Y. Not back,

462
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,199
forward Y. Back, forward Y. You have to, you have to walk forward for a full almost two seconds.

463
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:16,760
Like that. Or back. Nope. Back does not work. I feel like that's not very good. Yeah. If I,

464
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:22,680
okay. I'm hold, I'm going to hold back. One, two, three. Doesn't do anything. I'm holding forward.

465
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:34,140
One, one, two, three. Yeah. It's forward only. I feel like I would want to do the regular controls

466
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:39,420
for that one. I wonder if I could do it. I probably should just play with the regular controls.

467
01:37:44,890 --> 01:38:13,529
Hold forward while crouching. Ah, now, now you got it. There we go. Yeah. You bumped into me.

468
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:34,920
Sorry, buddy. Forward. What? Yeah. I don't like that at all. I think I was going to play with the

469
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:55,100
regular controls. Do I do it in here? Controls, right? Uh, modern. Let's do classic. Let's try it.

470
01:38:55,100 --> 01:39:23,579
So four back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back,

471
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:40,600
backward. Forward, back X. Forward, back X. Forward, back X. Forward, back. Wait, what?

472
01:39:42,489 --> 01:40:19,260
Why did they get rid of my, did take it off? I need to re equip it. That combo Omega Lola.

473
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:26,300
Relax. Okay. I don't play Street Fighter. I don't play Street Fighter. You need to calm down.

474
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:32,100
Don't Omega Lola combo me. I'm going back to modern. Some people don't make fun of me.

475
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:47,479
I'm going to go back to modern. Some people don't like make fun of me. What's wrong with that?

476
01:40:47,479 --> 01:40:58,329
Learn new actions from every master you study under. Cool. Street Fighter chat is toxic. No,

477
01:40:58,329 --> 01:41:15,960
what the hell can you do? What? I kind of want to learn that. That seems ridiculous. Okay. Well,

478
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:31,689
I definitely want to do that. All right. Special moves. What happened? Oh, this is how I do this.

479
01:41:31,689 --> 01:41:42,310
All right. All right. So forward, back, doesn't do it back. It's only forward. It's only Y.

480
01:41:46,710 --> 01:42:07,029
I'm going to get you. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Now I'm angry. Ouch. Ouch. Anybody know what that is?

481
01:42:07,029 --> 01:42:48,039
All right. How do I get out of here? All right. Down, up. Yeah. Wouldn't that cool? All right.

482
01:42:48,039 --> 01:43:20,090
So how do I do it? It's forward and Y, right? Oh shit. I'm going to lose. No, we're good. We're

483
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:33,100
good. All right. Cool. I'm just leveling up. All right. I'm going to, we'll do a little bit more

484
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:40,010
and then I'm going to take it online and they get destroyed for a little while and you can all laugh.

485
01:43:40,569 --> 01:43:46,409
Everybody can clip the moments where I get flawless. Didn't you know what I mean? Like

486
01:43:46,409 --> 01:44:48,180
we'll do that in like 10 minutes. Am I not on Chun-Li style? Oh, are you ready? Holy shit.

487
01:44:48,180 --> 01:45:03,260
Hold forward and Y. Oh, it's different because it's different character.

488
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:10,890
Dude, Jerma sucks at fighting games. That's fine. I'm going to have my fun playing the game.

489
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:17,079
You can get good. You can get to rank two, whatever you want to get to.

490
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:44,710
Almost level 10. All right. Anything else to do? Oh, you sup. Get to rank 10.

491
01:45:47,239 --> 01:45:50,359
Should I do the thing that people are going to be so pissed off though?

492
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,529
When I play online, you guys are going to hear a lot of this because I'm,

493
01:45:57,529 --> 01:46:04,250
I'm just going to hit every single button. And I know that people hate that, but he's a masher.

494
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:28,630
I know I'll try. It's okay. I do that too. Yeah. I think a lot of us. Okay. Well, you can discover

495
01:46:28,630 --> 01:46:34,550
the style that's truly yours. And the only time you can do that is in combat. I got to put some

496
01:46:34,550 --> 01:47:02,250
clothing on. Do you mind keeping an eye? Uh, talented. Okay. All right. That full body is.

497
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:22,699
All right. I can at least put pants on. There we go. I still have to learn how to do supers and

498
01:47:22,699 --> 01:47:36,470
stuff and drive gauge. And I don't know how to do any of that. Okay. Okay. You don't go,

499
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:46,779
you don't get it till chapter six. Should I take it online? What do you think? We're taking it

500
01:47:46,779 --> 01:48:06,090
online. Let's go hit up the basic tutorial. All right. I love this mode. I'm definitely

501
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:16,010
going to play it off stream. But did you guys do a poll to determine if I was going to play

502
01:48:16,010 --> 01:48:28,460
this ever again? What was the, what was the percentages? Okay. Most people online space to

503
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:45,130
play. Okay. Let's go. 66% said no. Okay. Quick join. Okay. I think I'm going to do quick join.

504
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:02,470
Okay. I'm not ready. I am not ready.

505
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:13,640
Not in a bad way. Of course. In an amazing way. So this is where I'd usually say you can go

506
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:20,970
wherever and do whatever. But wait, is these other, are these other players? I'm sure you're

507
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:26,250
going to have a lot of questions. This is your first time, right? He's going to rage quit.

508
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:32,630
No, I won't. Can we have a face cam for this? You want to see me my face when I lose? Yeah,

509
01:49:32,630 --> 01:49:39,260
we'll do in a minute. Hold on. The various points around here. Each one has a handy little

510
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:47,399
instruction pop up. So don't be nervous. Look at that. Look at that devil. Look at that devil.

511
01:49:47,399 --> 01:50:10,199
Go explore and have some filter usernames. Oh, should I? Okay. Okay. Okay.

512
01:50:14,489 --> 01:50:39,460
Somebody made a puppy. Okay. I like puppy. So where do I go? Look, I can tell who installed

513
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:44,100
the game 20 minutes ago. We all have the, you installed the game 20 minutes ago pants.

514
01:50:53,880 --> 01:51:18,119
Whoa. Hold on. Come here. This is awesome. This is so cool. Let's go. Oh, whatever. All right. Who

515
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:28,039
wants to fight? Does anybody want to fight? Okay. I think, can I challenge somebody to a duel?

516
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:45,420
How do you fight people? How do I? All right, let's do it. I'm ready. No, no, no. I want to fight.

517
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:54,039
How do we fight? Oh, who did I just fight? I don't know who this is. Apparently,

518
01:51:54,039 --> 01:52:36,859
they're an extreme rookie though. That's good for me. Let's go. Oh, shit. I got grabbed. I'm

519
01:52:36,859 --> 01:53:07,420
gonna try. Oh, that was a grab midair. What just happened? Good blocks. Good blocks. Good blocks.

520
01:53:13,210 --> 01:55:07,289
Shit. Don't do this to me. I won. I won. I did it. Oh, fuck. I fucked up. I fucked up. I'm sorry. I

521
01:55:07,289 --> 01:55:15,159
fucked up. That was my fault. I fucked it up. I fucked up. That's my fault. I screwed up. That's

522
01:55:15,159 --> 01:55:30,180
my fault. That was my fault. I did that. That was stupid. But we're fine. It's my fault. He's back.

523
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:46,300
All right. Let's go. And everybody can come and swarm me again. Come and swarm me. I was worried.

524
01:55:54,229 --> 01:56:04,420
Yeah. That's my own problem. I crashed it out. All right. I'm ready for a challenger. If anybody is

525
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:13,819
there, please. Ezfan was here. Wait. Did Ezfan raid right when I did that? Oh, that's unfortunate.

526
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:39,050
All right. Let's go. I'm ready to fight for real now. What happened? I accidentally turned my

527
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:59,079
fucking internet off. Don't ask me how. This first just destroyed me. What? I closed out of OBS.

528
01:56:59,079 --> 01:57:06,380
I turned my fucking internet off. I just fucked up. It wasn't a rage quit and it wasn't a bit. I

529
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:40,020
promise. All right. I got that too. All right. Bring it back. Shit. No. Are these the people

530
01:57:40,020 --> 01:58:01,500
watching us? No. Did I beat him or did I? Oh, that's too bad. No, rematch, rematch, rematch,

531
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:25,159
rematch. Let's do it again. Okay. That was good. Shit. What the fuck, man? Come on. Oh, my god.

532
01:58:25,159 --> 01:59:01,189
Damn it. Wait, his arms are longer. Fuck. How do I do moves? Shit. All right. I'm doing something

533
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:18,220
else. No, that was fun. Good game. Good game. Try a new character. How do you even play as a

534
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:29,270
different character? Can we just take everybody to the arcade or something? Like, can we just go ride

535
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:47,979
rides at an amusement park? Oh, my goodness. How do you even make that? It kind of is a Roblox

536
01:59:47,979 --> 02:00:12,039
lavia. Wait, what? Wait, we can play these? Can we play those together? This is really cool. Level

537
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:26,699
66. Holy shit. All right. How do I play with a different character? Can I pick a different

538
02:00:26,699 --> 02:00:34,439
character? Press X. Oh, okay. Here's the battle settings. Character, choose your character,

539
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:54,550
fighter profile. Okay. Who are these? Oh, all right. Okay. So who's good? I want to try this

540
02:00:54,550 --> 02:01:11,800
character. Oh, Blanca. Title setting. Let's do this. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Did I confirm it?

541
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:32,100
All right. I'm ready for a challenge. Anybody there? This person has three win streak.

542
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:47,779
Yeah. Oh, it's. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All

543
02:01:47,779 --> 02:02:04,789
right. All right. All right. This character is distracting. Yeah, it's playing a platform game

544
02:02:04,789 --> 02:02:15,420
and that this bro has five. Why did you get all this health? Look at this person's health. Is this

545
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:31,369
for real? Nope. Is that their health bar? What? You don't have three health bars, do you? This person

546
02:02:31,369 --> 02:02:54,939
has three. How is this possible? How do I do that? How do I do that move? That's so unfair.

547
02:02:54,939 --> 02:03:06,340
This guy's got two extra health bars. What the hell? All right. I'm going to play as a different.

548
02:03:06,340 --> 02:03:21,289
I want to play as a character. Okay. Character. Should I go just to the main menu? Go to a cabinet.

549
02:03:21,289 --> 02:03:37,979
Fight against other players. Oh, okay. I joined Q. Um, reserve player one side.

550
02:03:38,779 --> 02:03:48,069
Am I doing it right? Okay. Spectate while waiting, I guess.

551
02:04:05,819 --> 02:04:28,949
You need to. That felt weird. All right. Nice. Nice. Oh, this is you can fast forward. Wait,

552
02:04:29,590 --> 02:04:44,229
I just gave a thumbs up. Do you know that you're not playing? Yeah, I'm in the queue to play.

553
02:04:44,470 --> 02:05:19,989
Beautiful fight. I'm queued up. All right. All right. This person knows how to play.

554
02:05:19,989 --> 02:05:36,859
That face. Holy shit. Wow. That was cool. Hey, somebody said, Hey, is there a streamer here?

555
02:05:36,859 --> 02:05:52,539
Yeah. XQC. That's not. So what the fuck happened? Well, I know. All right. All right. I'm going

556
02:05:53,260 --> 02:06:01,859
change character costume. That's fine. All right. Am I ready? No, I want to get away from this one.

557
02:06:02,659 --> 02:06:26,380
All right. Sit down. Yes. Just queue for a match on the mat. This is me. This is me. All right.

558
02:06:26,380 --> 02:07:07,720
This is me. This is me. Oh, mirror match. You got it. Shit. What did I just do? What am I shortening

559
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:16,039
my butt to him for? What does this do? Oh my God. I need to, I need to do the tutorial of the video

560
02:07:16,039 --> 02:08:00,579
game. Okay. They didn't. What? Ow. Whoa. That was a cool move. Whoa. Oh, somebody learned how to play.

561
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:42,489
What's wrong with me? Ow. Oh yeah. Well, what about this shit? What's wrong with me? Why am I on

562
02:08:42,489 --> 02:09:04,520
drugs? Why am I on fucking crack? What's wrong with me? How do you do a super? How do I do super?

563
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:58,859
Oh, Y and B at the same time. You mean like that? All right. It's all right. It's all right. It's

564
02:09:58,859 --> 02:10:16,409
all right. Adorable. Jerma thinks he can play. Yeah. It's fine. I don't know what the fuck's

565
02:10:16,409 --> 02:10:24,140
going on. That doesn't matter. I'm having fun. All right. I want to play as a different character.

566
02:10:24,779 --> 02:10:54,699
All right. I'm going to sit at this one. You all fell for it. Okay. The tutorial would help you a

567
02:10:54,699 --> 02:11:06,390
lot. Yeah, I know. Cause I know there's like a parry. There's that paint move where you paint

568
02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:33,460
there's a whole super meter thing. There's a whole, there's a whole thing here. Shit. Shit.

569
02:11:35,300 --> 02:12:01,289
That did a lot of damage. Holy shit. Ow. What the fuck? The only way to get good is slamming your

570
02:12:01,289 --> 02:12:49,909
head against the brick wall. Oh, air grab. What does that do? Give me that grab. Give me the grab.

571
02:12:56,300 --> 02:13:26,220
Oh no. What was that? All right. I'll be back. I'm going to go do the tutorial.

572
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:41,369
All right. Everybody come over here. Stand right here. Facing this direction.

573
02:13:42,329 --> 02:13:50,739
Right here. Facing this direction, please. Okay. Stand here and face, uh, face me, please.

574
02:13:51,460 --> 02:14:05,720
No, not in front of me over on the white line. Okay. So everybody come over here. Only like 10

575
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:14,380
of you are actually listening. I feel like I've had dreams where this was what was happening.

576
02:14:15,609 --> 02:14:22,859
Okay. You ready? I'm telling you, we're going to play something here. You ready?

577
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:41,899
Simon says walk one step forward. Nice. Nice. Okay. Step back. Ah, you, you moved a little.

578
02:14:41,899 --> 02:14:56,949
You moved a little. All right. Now let's fucking go. How do I challenge? All right. Simon says do

579
02:14:56,949 --> 02:15:17,800
a full lap around the whole hub back here. Well, y'all lose. He's taking a picture, taking a selfie.

580
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:40,199
Oh, hold on a minute. Oh shit. I just hit like five people. Is that bad? All right. I'm going

581
02:15:40,199 --> 02:15:47,210
to go learn how to play the game. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'm just going to learn

582
02:15:47,210 --> 02:16:06,380
how to play the game. All right, let's go. All right. We know how to do this. We know how to do

583
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:09,579
this. We know how to do this. We know how to do this. We know how to do this. What's this?

584
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:20,979
Let's do a quick review of drive impacts. If your opponent's in the corner and you hit them,

585
02:16:20,979 --> 02:16:37,049
the drive impact. Okay. Okay. So there are some situations where this crush date won't occur.

586
02:16:37,610 --> 02:16:55,260
Okay. Well, I think we have to go back a few steps. Here we go. All right. The drive gauge.

587
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:02,940
These are powerful up special moves that consume two drive gauge blocks. I'm using a special move

588
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:09,799
that has an overdrive version. Press. Okay. Instead of one of the. All right. Overdrive

589
02:17:09,799 --> 02:17:15,399
arts have different properties than their standard counterparts. Just do the first one. God fucking

590
02:17:15,399 --> 02:17:45,930
damn it. Okay. Dashing. Yep. Why am I on classic? How come I can't change this? Why does this keep

591
02:17:45,930 --> 02:18:06,700
changing? Why does this keep changing? You pick the classic tutorial. Oh, come on. All right.

592
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:30,219
I'll get it in 10 minutes. And then I'm going back in there and I'm going to dominate. Yep.

593
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:49,159
It's dashing. Cool. Cool. Jumping. Yep. Okay. Good jumps. Normal attacks. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

594
02:18:50,780 --> 02:19:13,180
Uh huh. Down. Yep. Jump. Yep. Yep. Standing block and crouching block. That's good to know.

595
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:32,780
I didn't know that. Uh huh. See, I'm getting it. Okay. Crouch block. Yeah. I don't think

596
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:48,790
you would have figured that out right away. Yep. Okay. Throw escape by pressing X and A at the same

597
02:19:48,790 --> 02:20:04,790
time. Check your timing. Escape my throw. Oh, that's how you do it. All right. Nice. Okay. Yep.

598
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:25,350
Special moves. Rising up a cut. Nope. Okay. Here we go. This is it. Three levels. You have at least

599
02:20:25,350 --> 02:20:32,620
one you can perform a super art. Level one super art. Okay. Level one super art with either of

600
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:43,540
these. Forward B and Y. This is a level one super art. It's forward B and Y. Level two short range.

601
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:57,129
So it's away from your opponent. So you got to go like wham. Okay. Yep. All right. So you got to go

602
02:20:57,129 --> 02:21:05,020
like wham. Modern control scream. Omega low. No, that's fine. Look, if you know that I'm already

603
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:09,180
using modern controls, you probably, you probably left the stream like an hour ago. That's fine.

604
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:24,870
It's all good. So you go wham. All right. I get it now. So that's how you do that. But what about

605
02:21:24,870 --> 02:21:32,379
the left bumper thing I was pressing? Sure. We'll get it right now. Okay. There it is. All right.

606
02:21:32,379 --> 02:21:38,860
The six bar display shown here is known as the it indicates a fighter's concentration energy level.

607
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:46,940
Utilizing this gauge lets you perform unique actions. Okay. First off is the drive impact.

608
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:51,979
Press left bumper to perform a powerful attack. Just left bumper. Got it. So that uses one cube.

609
02:21:54,659 --> 02:21:58,100
They can absorb two attacks from the opponent, but there are some exceptions. When you're in

610
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:04,360
trouble, use the drive impact to break through an attack. Oh, so that's how you could, that's how

611
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:28,069
you stop somebody from doing a combo. Okay. Didn't I just do it? I'm not doing it. Press A dude. Oh,

612
02:22:31,479 --> 02:22:41,829
while I'm blocking. So it goes through block. All right. So it's mainly to get out of combos.

613
02:22:41,829 --> 02:23:00,389
I was using it as a, like a punch drive parry. Okay. So that's how you replenish the gauge.

614
02:23:02,309 --> 02:23:08,899
They cannot defend against throws. Try them out in real fight. While I perform a drive parry,

615
02:23:08,899 --> 02:23:18,809
press X and A at the same time to throw me. Yep. Okay. You don't want to use it in combos.

616
02:23:20,180 --> 02:23:25,299
Perfect parry is performing a drive parry. The moment an opponent attacks, it's you. Okay.

617
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:39,530
All right. Drive impacts are powerful to use for any fighter. Okay. So drive, you can use drive

618
02:23:39,530 --> 02:23:54,010
parry. Got it. Too much information. I'm going to go hit my sandbag. So parrying is insanely

619
02:23:54,010 --> 02:24:17,500
important, especially if you're in the corner. Okay. Yep. Okay. Burnout. The drive impact and

620
02:24:18,299 --> 02:24:22,459
drive parry are great uses of the drive gauge, but continuous use will drain the gauge. And if

621
02:24:22,459 --> 02:24:28,860
you drain it completely, you'll be unable to use it for a period of time. All right. So that's why

622
02:24:28,860 --> 02:24:44,729
I thought I was like on drugs and you get stunned. Okay. All right. When a fighter is in burnout,

623
02:24:44,729 --> 02:24:48,729
they can still be stunned even if they block a drive impact. Remember chasing someone into the

624
02:24:48,729 --> 02:24:57,690
corner gives you more chances. All right. I get, I think I got it now. I think I'm good. Okay. I'm

625
02:24:57,690 --> 02:25:13,430
ready. Yeah. I'm good to go. Name one move that was introduced. Drive parry, drive gauge, drive

626
02:25:13,430 --> 02:25:20,629
impacts, special one, special two, and special three. Special two is a hit back and press Y and

627
02:25:20,629 --> 02:25:36,229
B. Special three is crouch and hit Y and B. I paid attention. And that person for 25 minutes.

628
02:25:36,229 --> 02:26:12,059
There it is. There it is. I got it now. I got it now. What happens when your drive gauge is empty?

629
02:26:12,059 --> 02:26:16,780
You get, you get into dazed mode and you get, you can get stunned. I win. And that person for four

630
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:49,940
hours. Go back to the hub. I love that you can just kind of hang out here. Doing tournaments like this

631
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:59,510
would be so much fun. You actually can participate. I definitely don't want to fight the person that

632
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:14,739
has three boss health bars. Hey dude, I bet you can't recite the first 20 lines of, of, of pie.

633
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:33,129
Um, the pie, the math problem was a three, um, three point four one five nine two six five three

634
02:27:33,129 --> 02:27:58,329
five nine. Stage select. Ooh, hold on. Where do I want to go? Coliseum. Wait, I think I'm still,

635
02:27:58,329 --> 02:28:05,129
I'm still Blanca, aren't I? Wait, no, no, it's this, it's this guy again. I don't want to fight

636
02:28:05,129 --> 02:28:20,090
this person. They have too much. All right. Well, I learned a lot. So let's go. Wait, I don't have

637
02:28:20,090 --> 02:29:17,000
any drive powers. This is just a leveled up version of my character. Shit. I'm wicked fucking

638
02:29:17,000 --> 02:30:03,180
unpredictable. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I still have health. Damn it. Why can't I do

639
02:30:03,180 --> 02:30:11,399
special moves anymore? I'm pressing why it's not doing anything. What the fuck are my moves?

640
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:57,299
I don't have any moves. Got him. How do I not have a move to do? Oh, it's because I'm story locked.

641
02:30:57,299 --> 02:31:09,500
All right. I get it. I don't even have a super meter. Oh shit. Okay. I got to get out of here.

642
02:31:10,379 --> 02:31:41,379
We got, okay. Let me play the regular game now. Jesus. I'll try Blanca again. All right. Here we

643
02:31:41,379 --> 02:32:41,260
go. Now I know how to play. What? What? Oh, I'm not even in matchmaking. This person might have

644
02:32:41,260 --> 02:33:09,260
a hundred hours in this game, right? Is that accurate? LOL. He's using, no, I'm not getting

645
02:33:09,260 --> 02:33:38,739
better. Shit. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. No, it's not fair. I'm going to matchmaking. I'm going to matchmaking.

646
02:33:40,729 --> 02:33:56,729
I'm going to matchmaking. That was fun. Everyone. Good job. All of you. Thanks for playing. All

647
02:33:56,729 --> 02:34:02,040
right. I'm going to go do matchmaking to play against the real players of my skill level.

648
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:10,920
It was very, very good job. Nice work. But just do it from the pause menu. Can I do it from here?

649
02:34:11,559 --> 02:34:28,379
Is he won a single game? Press X. Oh, ranked matches on like that. All right. What's the

650
02:34:28,379 --> 02:35:02,709
character I would want to play with? Maybe Guile. Hmm. E Honda. I know if I play this character,

651
02:35:02,709 --> 02:35:16,139
I'm going to spam X and people are going to get really bad at me. Oh, all right. I'm doing E

652
02:35:16,139 --> 02:35:36,040
Honda. Fuck it. Let's go. Okay. I don't want to hear about spinning bird kick anymore. Get me away

653
02:35:36,040 --> 02:36:05,139
from them. All right. This is a real challenge now. Let's go. All right. Good. Good. Nice hit.

654
02:36:05,139 --> 02:36:41,530
Nice hit. Oh, good counter. Shit. Nice lock. All right. So we start. Let's get started. Let's go.

655
02:36:53,260 --> 02:37:15,500
Land it. Oh, what? All right. All right. All right. Good throw escape. Good job, dude. All right. I'll

656
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:28,549
get it too. There we go. That's first one of the night. First win of the night. Thank God.

657
02:37:28,549 --> 02:37:42,459
Finally, I do a rematch. I think you're right. This is a computer. How is this computer?

658
02:37:56,299 --> 02:38:09,700
It's for placement. Oh, all right. I get it. Oh, I'm going to get put like,

659
02:38:10,579 --> 02:38:26,940
I'm going to put in chicken league. No, I'm not. That's fine. It wasn't terrible.

660
02:38:29,059 --> 02:39:14,379
Look, I could do more grabs. Way more grabs. Shit. You're getting better. That's good to hear. It's

661
02:39:14,379 --> 02:39:34,920
fun. Back special is your best move. Okay. So now that's it, right? Quit. Uh, previous mode. How do

662
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:48,899
I just keep going? You got to learn the headbutt. Okay. Ranked match. I think it's still happening.

663
02:39:48,899 --> 02:39:54,469
Okay, cool. Let's swarm his body and vibrate him to death like we're bees.

664
02:39:58,809 --> 02:40:47,719
Okay. Hello. This is a real fight. This is a real person. Shit. Oh, he's caught up in a combo. Caught

665
02:40:47,719 --> 02:40:59,020
up in a combo. Stop screaming for no reason. Like I'm, what am I doing? This guy's quick.

666
02:41:00,149 --> 02:41:35,540
Ow. All right. That's a grab. What kind of move is that? How about back in YB, right?

667
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:51,540
Why won't he do it? How come I can't do my special move back in YB, back YB, back YB. Why is it not

668
02:41:51,540 --> 02:42:05,239
working? Why is it not working? I had three bars. I, why, why couldn't I do back YB? I had three bars

669
02:42:07,559 --> 02:42:18,979
back YB is two bar. Didn't I have three? You're on the right. I was doing, I was,

670
02:42:18,979 --> 02:42:23,940
I was doing back YB. I'm promising you. It's different inputs for every account. Oh, come on.

671
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:52,940
Really? All right. Well, I didn't, I have no idea how to do them. God damn it. I'm just not fast

672
02:42:52,940 --> 02:43:27,610
enough. Come on. Jesus. What the fuck? This guy's got insane zoning moves. It's just like an S tier

673
02:43:27,610 --> 02:43:47,780
character. I feel like he is. I just did back YB and it didn't do anything. Whatever. There's

674
02:43:47,780 --> 02:43:54,860
a genre of video game that I've put maybe collectively four hours of time into.

675
02:43:56,760 --> 02:44:24,219
It's Street Fighter. I almost did it. I need a new character. Don't clap for me. I didn't win.

676
02:44:24,940 --> 02:46:08,780
That should come out. I can do that too. Yo. Oh, good. Good counter. Oh shit. Back it up. I'm stunned.

677
02:46:08,780 --> 02:46:45,190
I'm stunned. I'm stunned. I got to back it up. Shit. That's bad. Let's go. I won. I won one match.

678
02:46:45,750 --> 02:47:25,340
I got to figure out how to do the other move. Oh, all right. I should have blocked it. Oh,

679
02:47:26,139 --> 02:47:41,159
this game's fun. Even if I'm not very good at it. I'm learning though. I'm getting, I'm getting

680
02:47:41,159 --> 02:48:27,739
better. Oh, nice job. Good job. Shit. Shit. Jump. Jump out of the way. I'm dead. All right. That was

681
02:48:27,739 --> 02:48:34,409
better. I got to do combo try. Yeah. I mean, I could learn really genuinely how to play a character,

682
02:48:34,409 --> 02:49:15,340
but I'm just having fun. It's all good. Got it. It's down. Shit. I almost blocked it. Shit. No.

683
02:49:16,459 --> 02:49:23,659
Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. Okay. I need to figure out how to play the game.

684
02:49:30,889 --> 02:49:52,200
I got to figure out how to play better and play combo trials. Here we go. And who do I actually

685
02:49:52,200 --> 02:50:14,219
want to play with? Let's see. I don't know. Maybe character guide. It's DJ. Who's DJ? How

686
02:50:14,219 --> 02:50:31,340
to play DJ. Okay. All right. Moves I can use to control the rhythm of battle.

687
02:50:34,200 --> 02:51:11,909
Faints. Oh, that's cool. Seems fun. That's a lot of fake outs. Is that it? Okay. I'll try it. All

688
02:51:11,909 --> 02:51:36,889
right. Rebeat combo. That's just X, X, X. Sure. DJ special board. Was it X board? I'm doing it,

689
02:51:36,889 --> 02:52:22,010
right? Oh, whoa. Okay. A, B, B. Cool. Cool. Okay. What button is he pressing? Show inputs. Whoa.

690
02:52:22,809 --> 02:52:37,700
Okay. Trial display method. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's too many buttons.

691
02:52:40,139 --> 02:52:50,440
Command display. Oh, there we go. Okay. So what is it? Hold right trigger and then X, X.

692
02:52:51,319 --> 02:53:01,590
Okay. Then it's cool. Whoa. This more of this. Holy shit. Okay. Well, I didn't do any of that.

693
02:53:01,590 --> 02:53:44,500
It was cool. That's so cool. I just have to press one button. That's so fun. Okay. And then it's down.

694
02:53:44,500 --> 02:54:26,549
Okay. How fast do we have to do it? There it is. Okay. Nice. All right. Intermediate

695
02:54:26,549 --> 02:54:54,420
during a forward jump. Ooh, that'll catch people. Oh, there's more. Why? And then why? Why? Holy

696
02:54:54,420 --> 02:55:12,139
shit. Okay. Well, connected with the special cancelable move. Forward, forward. Whoa. This

697
02:55:12,139 --> 02:55:47,909
one's going to be hard. That's a lot of presses. Shit. Shit. Shit. Really? I can't string the

698
02:55:47,909 --> 02:56:48,520
bottom B together. Did that work? That's going to be way too hard. Ooh, no, it's not. And then

699
02:56:48,520 --> 02:57:03,209
it's right trigger A. I keep forgetting to hold right trigger. That's actually kind of hard to

700
02:57:03,209 --> 02:57:33,930
do that. Holding right trigger and pressing A is kind of weird. Really? Shit. What is it supposed

701
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:40,120
to be? What is it? Let me see the move. After down B, what does it look like? Okay. You just have to

702
02:57:40,120 --> 02:58:05,829
do it really fast. All right. No, I'm done. I'm going to sit here for like four hours to get that

703
02:58:05,829 --> 02:58:42,020
done. I'm going to take it to the computer. Go to the beach. Who should I go against? Dengue?

704
02:58:42,819 --> 02:58:59,209
There was more in the character guide. I pressed like A. We come up together. That's funny.

705
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:52,549
All right. X forward down B. Whoa. Okay. I just got to learn the combos.

706
02:59:52,549 --> 03:00:23,459
That was close. You know, going the other direction is impossible for my brain to do in fighting

707
03:00:23,459 --> 03:00:36,620
games. That combo I just learned has to be from left to right. You know what I mean? It's like

708
03:00:36,620 --> 03:00:51,340
reading. I have to like do the whole thing backwards. It's funny. God damn it. Focus on

709
03:00:51,340 --> 03:01:15,079
fundamentals first. That's true. I can't wait to watch people play because I like watching people

710
03:01:15,079 --> 03:01:33,750
play things very well and they're probably going to do very good at this game. One time I played

711
03:01:34,309 --> 03:01:41,459
Mortal Kombat, the newer one from like seven or eight years ago, and I sat in a call. I believe

712
03:01:41,459 --> 03:01:49,430
I was in a call with like boo stealth stir and just practicing Kenshi's combo over and over again

713
03:01:49,430 --> 03:01:55,670
for like four straight hours and just sitting there and just trying to get it burned into muscle

714
03:01:55,670 --> 03:02:08,280
memory. There's something about that that's really fun, but we'll do a few more and then I'm going to

715
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:24,059
call it. This is really cool though. I think it's really good. Let's go back to the hub. I did that

716
03:02:24,059 --> 03:02:33,450
for years because I didn't have good online. Yeah. It's fun because once you actually get a combo

717
03:02:34,010 --> 03:02:43,780
and you do it in a game scenario, it's like, mom, get the camera. Okay. Let's do matchmaking,

718
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:59,739
right? How do I set it to matchmaking? Oh, character. I need to get my character. Wait, what?

719
03:02:59,739 --> 03:03:30,409
What? It's on ranked. All right. Let me see if I can put something together here.

720
03:03:47,030 --> 03:04:28,040
Shit. That's not good. I'm already out of juice. Damn it. This lost the CPU. Yeah. I get it,

721
03:04:28,040 --> 03:05:10,409
but I don't get it. You got to get your hands to agree with your brain. Yeah. How are you guys

722
03:05:10,409 --> 03:05:16,489
liking it though? How are you guys actually liking the game for street fighter seasoned veterans?

723
03:05:16,489 --> 03:05:25,530
Is it good? Do you think it's a good one? It feels like it's fun to play. It's hard,

724
03:05:25,530 --> 03:05:36,139
but honestly, I like it. Oh my goodness. He's just destroying me. Oh, I said a fake out.

725
03:05:43,110 --> 03:06:05,989
Shit. Oh, no, I can't lose to the CPU. I was looking at chat.

726
03:06:58,700 --> 03:07:05,959
It's fun. It's really fun. Maybe I'll learn it. Maybe I'll just sit on the couch and learn some

727
03:07:05,959 --> 03:07:15,059
combos. You know what I mean? I don't know. It's definitely really fun to play. I like the modern

728
03:07:15,059 --> 03:07:51,979
control scheme. I think it's a good addition to the game. Just learn easy combos and do those.

729
03:07:51,979 --> 03:08:02,520
You don't need to do big combos yet. That's true. That's very true. Just do whatever you like doing.

730
03:08:02,520 --> 03:08:05,719
Just never tell yourself that you have some artificial limit on your skill. You can be as

731
03:08:05,719 --> 03:08:17,690
good as you want to be. Oh my God. The street fighter community is so nice. Are you serious?

732
03:08:20,059 --> 03:08:29,899
Wow. You guys are great. Look at you guys telling me that I could learn combos and I'm doing good

733
03:08:29,899 --> 03:08:49,350
and doing better. Holy smokes. Wow. All right. Thank you. You guys are great. Real ranked match

734
03:08:49,350 --> 03:09:07,430
now. Vibes are immaculate. We're going to face a good DJ. I'm kind of concerned.

735
03:09:17,079 --> 03:09:29,620
This is really nice. This is cool. All right. Let's go. I got punished really bad. Oh my God.

736
03:09:29,620 --> 03:10:12,899
I'm already empty. Oh my goodness. I'm already empty. That was a lot of early damage. What the

737
03:10:12,899 --> 03:10:41,610
fuck did we both just do? Get out of the corner. Oh, not good. Oh, I just like punched him in the

738
03:10:41,610 --> 03:11:00,680
fucking balls. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, that's bad. Oh, he got me right in the corner. Shit.

739
03:11:01,479 --> 03:11:46,379
I was too scared. Oh shit. Oh my God. How many times is he going to do that move in a row?

740
03:11:54,709 --> 03:12:17,899
Oh, he had so, he had so much drive. He almost got me with the drive. Let's do it again. Shit.

741
03:12:17,899 --> 03:13:02,500
All right. I got to be careful. Ouch. Oh shit. Now you're in trouble. Oh my God. I'm just doing

742
03:13:02,500 --> 03:13:17,319
the thing. What am I doing? I'm throwing so hard. I just kicked in the wrong direction like three

743
03:13:17,319 --> 03:13:57,219
times. That was close. What happened? Oh, this is bad news. Oh, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake.

744
03:14:10,020 --> 03:15:10,549
Good game. Oh no, there's one more. Oh, come on. Oh, that's bad. That's all right. Shit. I forgot

745
03:15:10,549 --> 03:15:32,180
how to do the fucking super. I was hitting back YB instead of forward YB. One more. Oh, you never

746
03:15:32,180 --> 03:15:40,569
even learned what the supers were for this character. That's true. That's true. How do you

747
03:15:40,569 --> 03:16:00,340
do them? Forward YB is one. Down YB is two. What was the projectile? They're the same for everybody?

748
03:16:01,139 --> 03:16:39,420
Really? All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

749
03:16:40,219 --> 03:17:23,209
The supers are the same for everybody. Cool. Cool. Cool. Oh, what? He actually blocked it.

750
03:17:23,209 --> 03:17:54,870
Nice job. Whoa. Oh, I just got fucking destroyed. All right, let's go. This is the one right here.

751
03:18:11,299 --> 03:18:43,989
It's okay. It's all right. Oh, I'm like stunned now. Oh, shit. Nice job. God damn it. So, okay,

752
03:18:43,989 --> 03:18:52,780
my two super, I have to chain it together apparently. I guess. Do I have to just press X

753
03:18:52,780 --> 03:19:47,430
or something? Shit. Not good. It's based on rhythm really. Oh, it's hard to hit. But we both

754
03:19:47,430 --> 03:20:07,770
have three. This is not going to end well. Oh, I got it. All right. Now he's going to do his like

755
03:20:07,770 --> 03:20:11,049
right now. I'm going to flee. I'm going to be a coward. I got to play like a coward for a few

756
03:20:11,049 --> 03:20:58,600
minutes. Did I jump over it? Oh no. Wait, what? I got away from it. Shit. Should have countered

757
03:20:58,600 --> 03:21:43,190
with my own. Shit. Oh, damn it. No. I got outplayed. Oh my God. I just got so outplayed.

758
03:21:43,190 --> 03:21:54,469
I panicked five times in a row. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. Fuck. I got the

759
03:21:54,469 --> 03:21:59,899
comeback you got in your head. You know what I need to stop doing? I have to stop pressing

760
03:21:59,899 --> 03:22:06,329
left bumper as if it's punch. I keep doing it. I'm like, oh, left bumper. Yeah, that's a big

761
03:22:06,889 --> 03:22:21,579
punch counters. Don't use it as offense. Go for grabs too. That's true.

762
03:22:39,420 --> 03:23:54,149
Whoa. Nice. Okay. All right. Oh my goodness. I got fucking annihilated. Oh, he's trying. He's doing

763
03:23:54,149 --> 03:24:17,479
something. I saw he's doing a fatality. I saw him do like down, down, down, down. This is fun. I just

764
03:24:17,479 --> 03:24:35,450
got to learn. Just have to learn and I'll be good. Are we good? Are we good? No. There we go.

765
03:24:38,920 --> 03:25:00,379
I main DJ. He's a blast. He seems fun. Oh my goodness.

766
03:25:25,059 --> 03:27:18,409
What? Damn it. Oh, yeah. What? Oh, damn it. No. I parried it. What? No. Oh, well, that's a lot of

767
03:27:18,409 --> 03:28:11,989
exes. I got to be more aggressive. Shit. Shit. Shit. No again. Oh, I can't finish the job.

768
03:28:12,790 --> 03:28:59,370
Oh, that move. How do I get away from that move? Did she just take my super away? I'm going to lose.

769
03:29:00,729 --> 03:29:13,049
What is she doing to me? She's taking all my shit. What the fuck? You're just panicking.

770
03:29:13,049 --> 03:29:42,649
This game's too hard. Throw fireballs. How do you throw a fireball back? Why also can somebody help

771
03:29:42,649 --> 03:29:50,489
me? I feel like I'm always like zero drive, even if I don't use the meter, even if I don't

772
03:29:50,489 --> 03:30:42,120
use the bars. Am I doing something wrong? Do the move. What? Oh, I'm okay. Jesus. The ex moves

773
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:47,590
burn drive. Those are happening automatically though, aren't they? Because of the modern

774
03:30:48,469 --> 03:31:25,799
combat system. Hmm. Oh, okay. Wake up from a knockdown. You need to block more.

775
03:31:26,440 --> 03:31:31,270
That's the drawback of using modern, less controlled than meters. Hmm. That's good to know.

776
03:31:56,389 --> 03:32:15,239
How do I do my free move? I couldn't do my three super. I did down and YB. It didn't do anything.

777
03:32:15,879 --> 03:32:23,750
What the hell? I was hitting down YB, down YB, down YB. I'm just going to learn how to play on

778
03:32:23,750 --> 03:33:14,469
classic. Oh, I had one meter. I'm an idiot. I'm looking at the bottom left. Try to mix it up.

779
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:46,920
Yeah. All right. Here we go. Oh, it didn't do anything. No, he wants to e-haunt me right now.

780
03:33:48,010 --> 03:33:51,850
I know what you're going to do. I know. I know what you have. You have your triple combo thing.

781
03:33:52,649 --> 03:34:21,370
I ain't fucking around. He wants to do it so bad. I know he does. No, no, that's all right. All

782
03:34:21,370 --> 03:34:34,870
right. One more and I'm done. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. One more. Last one. You're being

783
03:34:34,870 --> 03:34:44,790
more patient. Yeah. In fighting games, I just get in my own head and I go just press every button,

784
03:34:44,790 --> 03:34:58,329
even if you don't need to, and just run and jump five times in a row. Okay. New character. I haven't

785
03:34:58,329 --> 03:35:57,479
seen before. Oh, cool. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Good. Still, I could have lost it there.

786
03:35:57,479 --> 03:35:59,879
Does that drink do something? It's not just a taunt.

787
03:36:50,229 --> 03:37:09,979
Fuck. Come on. Break out of it with your thing. Do your thing. Oh, my goodness. He gets new special

788
03:37:09,979 --> 03:38:04,260
moves. Oh, boy. That's not good. Hey, stop relying on the auto combos. Yeah. Well, now that I know

789
03:38:04,260 --> 03:38:34,809
that it's using meter, it's using bars. I'm trying not to use it that frequently. Oh, that was weird.

790
03:38:35,370 --> 03:39:29,399
Oh, not good. Use RTY more. Oh, you're using RTY too much. Okay. Oh, who did it? Oh, all right.

791
03:39:29,399 --> 03:40:24,489
You got your three. I'm terrified of you. I don't know how the fucking move works. No. He's just

792
03:40:24,489 --> 03:40:44,299
ducking. Oh, my God. I used it all. I used it all. How did I do that? I used that. I went to drain

793
03:40:44,299 --> 03:41:53,100
it to zero. What does CA mean? Critical Art. Oh, okay. That's a good game. Nice fight. It's level

794
03:41:53,100 --> 03:42:05,530
three. So I probably would have got killed by that. Damn. All right. Actually, last one. I mean it.

795
03:42:06,600 --> 03:42:15,290
Last one. I appreciate all the help, though. I'm very new to this. It's really cool. Appreciate it.

796
03:42:15,850 --> 03:42:21,319
You guys have been really nice to me. I was going to look over. I was scared I was going to look

797
03:42:21,319 --> 03:42:32,680
over and it was like, oh, no, they hate me. All right. I rank up opportunity. All right.

798
03:43:14,870 --> 03:44:06,950
All right. I tried to be really patient. Shit. Why are you still bad at this game?

799
03:44:07,590 --> 03:44:11,590
This is the second time I've seen this character play. I don't even know what this guy's... I know

800
03:44:11,590 --> 03:45:02,739
he drinks alcohol. You know what? Time that person up for five seconds. Holy shit. He just fucking

801
03:45:02,739 --> 03:45:12,760
destroyed me. When somebody gets in a rhythm, it's just like, I don't even know what to do.

802
03:45:16,899 --> 03:46:04,170
What the fuck was that? I'm trying to throw fireballs. Why did he just do that? Really?

803
03:46:14,780 --> 03:46:31,700
All right. We can do it again. Shit. I don't know what's going on with him, but he seems

804
03:46:31,700 --> 03:46:57,719
very angry and very drunk. It's been a lot of screaming. Sorry about that.

805
03:46:59,700 --> 03:47:34,440
Okay. I got to pull together here. I did like no damage to him. Oh, my God. He hurts so much.

806
03:47:34,440 --> 03:48:14,840
This guy's fucking crazy. All right. Okay. That's enough. I had fun. That was fun. All right. Last

807
03:48:14,840 --> 03:48:32,389
one. Chun-Li. Okay. You're going to end on a loss. I know that's... I'm going to use this philosophy.

808
03:48:33,590 --> 03:50:12,500
One of my earbuds fell out. Disaster. I was a little scared there. Oh, shit. I got caught

809
03:50:12,500 --> 03:51:05,350
in the corner. All right. This last one. Shit. Shit. Okay. Well, I just got fucking annihilated.

810
03:51:05,350 --> 03:51:34,250
Okay. I keep forgetting you can do the grab parry. I forget it. All right. I didn't mean to even do

811
03:51:34,250 --> 03:52:59,239
that move. Fuck. Oh, okay. All right. One more. It was one and one. It was one and one. Damn it.

812
03:52:59,239 --> 03:53:09,819
I still got it. Everyone's either playing Diablo or this. Well, they're two new, cool, fun video

813
03:53:09,819 --> 03:53:20,309
games. I didn't mean to do that. Oh, my God. I got to stop doing that. I'm just... Oh, I fucked up

814
03:53:20,309 --> 03:53:27,989
everything. If you don't know how to do the move, don't pretend to do it and spam the move

815
03:53:27,989 --> 03:54:10,790
three times and then just burn all your meter. Really? Oh, I'm so screwed here. Damn it. All

816
03:54:10,790 --> 03:54:15,590
right. All right. This time, don't go back wide, back wide, back wide and have no fucking squares

817
03:54:15,590 --> 03:55:12,040
left, you dummy. That's bad. That's game over. Should have blocked. Yeah. All right. Last one.

818
03:55:12,680 --> 03:55:19,110
All right. No matter what happens, this is the last one for... It's over. One more and that's it.

819
03:55:19,110 --> 03:56:00,600
I should have ended when I won. Oh, no. Not this guy. That little head tilt at the end. Whoa.

820
03:56:02,180 --> 03:56:15,370
What the hell is that? That was crazy. I can't grab this guy. How close are I going to be?

821
03:56:22,809 --> 03:57:00,940
Shit. What the fuck? That did like 35% of my health. Is that just a regular grab? I missed it. Oh,

822
03:57:00,940 --> 03:57:23,719
my God. Shit. Come on, dude. Oh, my God. That sucks. It's not over yet. Oh, my God.

823
03:57:25,959 --> 03:57:35,770
I don't know how far it went forward. I thought it went much further than that. Shit. Damn it.

824
03:57:35,770 --> 03:58:06,309
It's all right. What the hell? Oh, my God. Bad idea. I'm getting fucking dominated right now.

825
03:58:30,200 --> 03:59:12,200
I didn't even throw him. What? Oh, that's not good. All right. At least it's something okay.

826
03:59:13,159 --> 03:59:17,100
I'm starting to understand it. He's super good at zoning though. That's the...

827
03:59:17,260 --> 03:59:20,299
I'm saying words. I don't know what they actually mean. I'm just saying them.

828
03:59:32,100 --> 03:59:49,180
Oh, I try to catch it again. Bad idea. That was really stupid of me. That was really dumb of me.

829
03:59:49,180 --> 04:00:14,360
I don't know why I did that. Oh, my God. He's un-fucking-bearable. He has moves that go across

830
04:00:14,360 --> 04:00:17,799
the screen. He's got moves that are close. He's got things to shoot from the fucking ceiling.

831
04:00:18,440 --> 04:00:41,110
All right. That one doesn't count. I got to end on a win. All right. No matter what happens,

832
04:00:41,110 --> 04:00:54,379
this is the final one. I promise. I'm done after this. Everyone's clapping. Hey, thanks.

833
04:00:57,610 --> 04:01:04,090
I wish you well in the world of... I almost just said StarCraft. Street Fighter.

834
04:01:11,989 --> 04:01:14,790
All right. This is the one right here. I'm going to try as hard as I can. I'm going to be quiet

835
04:01:14,790 --> 04:01:46,840
the whole time. Here we go. Three, two, one. Quiet. I just tried as hard as I could.

836
04:01:56,700 --> 04:02:25,479
Nice. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.

837
04:02:41,459 --> 04:02:47,139
No. Why did that not connect? I don't understand StarCraft.

838
04:03:12,219 --> 04:04:15,909
Did it. Okay. What? Stream lagging? Oh, it shouldn't be. Nice. Okay. All right.

839
04:04:16,549 --> 04:04:47,219
That was a good parry. Oh, shit. I just got perfect in the corner. Shit. Oh, my God. My face is

840
04:04:47,219 --> 04:05:11,180
sweating. I forgot how to play the game. I'm in trouble now. Whoa. That was laggy. So good,

841
04:05:11,180 --> 04:05:44,979
though. What? Why did that get animation canceled by every fucking move in the game?

842
04:05:45,940 --> 04:06:06,059
I did it. That was close. All right. That's it. That was really fun. Street Fighter 6

843
04:06:06,059 --> 04:06:11,959
is great. I could see how people could dump hundreds of hours into this game.

844
04:06:12,520 --> 04:06:25,270
I completely get it. That was awesome. Oh, shit. I mean, we have to do it. I'm just here.

845
04:06:25,829 --> 04:06:30,379
Didn't mean to. I just, I tried to exit. You saw me hit the button.

846
04:06:40,500 --> 04:06:44,180
Sorry I turned the stream off halfway through. That was really stupid of me.

847
04:06:44,260 --> 04:07:05,430
It's all right, though. We had fun. I never did face cam either. We'll do it next time.

848
04:07:06,309 --> 04:08:01,100
All right. This is the one here. Right here. Shit. Oh, I somehow pulled that out of my ass.

849
04:08:22,739 --> 04:09:27,930
Shit. I can do that too. Oh. All right. We have to do a revenge. All right. Easy. Hold on.

850
04:09:27,930 --> 04:10:18,420
Oh, that was, I blew it. Sorry. I blew it. It's fine. Shit. Oh, I fucking lost it in this last

851
04:10:18,420 --> 04:10:34,360
round. Big time. Now I forgot what the controls were. All right. That's a, that's a 1v1.

852
04:10:35,079 --> 04:10:42,809
That's I-1-1. That's, yeah. We gotta go for the whole thing. Gotta go for the whole thing. This

853
04:10:42,809 --> 04:11:31,290
is the World Series right here. God damn it. I can't do anything. Oh my God. I'm getting

854
04:11:31,290 --> 04:12:11,500
fucking screwed. All right. Aggression. Let's go. All right. That was, that was like I handed the

855
04:12:11,500 --> 04:13:12,409
controller to somebody else. No. Oh, no. Shit. I just didn't know what to do for a follow-up.

856
04:13:12,409 --> 04:13:22,299
I just was like, what do I do? I, what do I do? It's like, wow, I put it all together and oh,

857
04:13:22,299 --> 04:13:31,850
he's just, he's lying on his back. Okay. Oh, B. All right. Last one or I'll delete my Twitch

858
04:13:31,850 --> 04:13:42,360
channel. This is the last one. If this series, whatever the series ends up being, I'm playing

859
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:52,790
against this next person. Even if we rematch, that's fine. But that's it. I'm out. What the

860
04:13:52,790 --> 04:14:06,870
hell? What was that? Stopped saying last one. Well, I, I was supposed to leave. It's time for

861
04:14:06,870 --> 04:15:31,750
dinner. I'm only leaving because I need to eat. Let's go. You got garlic bread down? Oh, I got

862
04:15:31,750 --> 04:16:09,829
garlic bread. I gotta get out of here. Okay. All right. Oh, what happens? What happens now?

863
04:16:10,790 --> 04:16:28,059
What just happened? I caught him right in the chin. I don't know what happened, but that was

864
04:16:28,059 --> 04:17:30,680
pretty crazy. All right. Cool. Hmm. Oh, what? I grabbed him. All right. I got, I got a lot of

865
04:17:30,680 --> 04:18:13,719
meter. I'm good. All right. That's all right. That's all right. All right. That's it. That was fun.

866
04:18:13,719 --> 04:18:24,780
Oh, I can see how people just delete weeks of their life to this game. I never got into,

867
04:18:24,780 --> 04:18:31,739
I didn't really care for them. They were always too hard. Well, not hard. It just, it was always,

868
04:18:31,739 --> 04:18:38,170
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I gotta get out of here. Thanks for playing whoever played.

869
04:18:38,170 --> 04:18:51,430
That was a lot of fun. I will see you guys in a couple of days. I'll see you on Wednesday,

870
04:18:51,989 --> 04:19:07,540
Wednesday the 7th. Gollum, 4.5 out of 10. Street Fighter 6. I mean, I don't know, like nine.

871
04:19:07,540 --> 04:19:22,149
This is great. I actually really liked this game. It's cool that people think that this is a good

872
04:19:22,149 --> 04:19:35,399
one because I'm having fun with it. Yeah. Four o'clock on Wednesday. Yeah. I promise we'll go

873
04:19:35,479 --> 04:19:43,059
over a gen lost stuff. I kind of got addicted to this game. I forgot about everything because that

874
04:19:43,059 --> 04:19:52,309
was an unbelievable experience. So I definitely want to talk a little bit more about it. Yeah.

875
04:19:52,309 --> 04:19:55,750
I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Why is my voice gone? Have I just

876
04:19:55,750 --> 04:20:10,950
been yelling? Oh, every time I get KO'd, I went, Oh, right. I forgot. Thanks for watching. See you

877
04:20:10,950 --> 04:20:27,930
later. See you soon. Let's actually, let me quit this correctly. That's Street Fighter 6. Yeah.

878
04:20:27,930 --> 04:20:45,049
I'm sweating. Sweaty game. See you soon. Thanks for watching. How do you exit the game?

879
04:20:45,770 --> 04:20:57,059
I don't know how to leave. Where's the quit game button? How do you leave? I don't know how to leave.

880
04:21:01,590 --> 04:21:10,729
Menu. Exit two. Okay. You have to press. Okay. Exit desktop. There it is. All right. Call your

881
04:21:10,729 --> 04:21:19,370
mother. See you later. Otto's doing better. You don't know Otto had a bladder infection. He still

882
04:21:19,370 --> 04:21:26,780
does. And yesterday I wanted to make sure that we monitored him. I can't even talk right now.

883
04:21:27,020 --> 04:21:35,299
That we monitored him because he had to go outside every 45 minutes or so. He's drinking

884
04:21:35,299 --> 04:21:47,129
a lot of water, but he's on antibiotics. Seems to be doing much better. He's good. Yep. Wednesday

885
04:21:47,129 --> 04:21:55,450
is the next stream day. I might play more Street Fighter. Would you guys like it if I actually

886
04:21:55,450 --> 04:22:09,719
learned the game and actually learned how to play more and play it some more? I had a lot of fun.

887
04:22:09,719 --> 04:22:16,250
Yeah. Just jumping off for like a couple of, I'm going to learn some more combos.

888
04:22:17,129 --> 04:22:23,290
I might play with some other characters too. Get better. Take more creative characters. Yeah.

889
04:22:29,319 --> 04:22:37,110
Thanks for being so, I said this earlier, but that was, it was like no toxic chat members.

890
04:22:37,110 --> 04:22:51,620
It's unbelievable. I don't think I've ever seen that before. No, they were. They were. Somebody

891
04:22:51,620 --> 04:23:08,649
said there were plenty. I just wasn't looking at the right time. That's funny. They really were.

892
04:23:09,450 --> 04:23:23,299
It's okay. I don't, it doesn't bother me. I don't feel pressured. No, I, I really, look, I know what

893
04:23:23,299 --> 04:23:31,989
I'm capable of doing. Fighting games are usually not one of them, but you can call me, you can call me

894
04:23:31,989 --> 04:23:38,069
a shitty player. That's fine. It's your opinion. You're allowed to have it. You can call me a,

895
04:23:38,069 --> 04:23:45,299
you can call me a modern Andy and then say that I fucking smell and that I'm bad at this game.

896
04:23:47,139 --> 04:23:52,219
But if you do that, you, you're going to get zapped. Just telling you.

897
04:23:54,700 --> 04:24:13,340
The fighting game community loves you. Really? Thanks guys. They didn't know that. Well, you

898
04:24:13,340 --> 04:24:16,139
can't, that's a, that's a very big blanket statement. I'm sure there's plenty of people

899
04:24:16,139 --> 04:24:23,860
that don't like me, but I appreciate it nonetheless. All right. Good night guys.

900
04:24:23,860 --> 04:24:40,219
See you later. Call your mother. Goodbye. See you Wednesday. See you later.
