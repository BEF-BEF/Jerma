1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:15,429
Listen to that sound, listen to that sound, listen to this sound. It should. PS2 Slim. Okay, yeah, let's do it.

2
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:23,309
So this was a guitar stream that had a coliseum in the middle.

3
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:30,050
Let's do this. This is gonna be called Strummin' Along.

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:46,179
Um, Jammer, Lammy. Did it work? Let's make sure it works first. Reading disc. Is it gonna work?

5
00:00:46,179 --> 00:01:02,700
PlayStation. Alright. Strummin' Along. Um, Jammer, Lammy. Let's do it. Does it work? Come on, work.

6
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:13,709
I don't have a PS1 memory card in here. Does that matter? I mean, this game's only like an hour and a half long, isn't it?

7
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:18,019
Like, I'm... It's not like it's gonna be a problem. I'm gonna beat it now.

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
This is made by the Rappa the Rappa Design Studio team.

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
Don't cry about this. No, I will not.

10
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:54,060
That sure was fun. Part one was good too, but this one had more juice.

11
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,519
Wait, was that Beaker?

12
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,519
What's wrong, Lammy? You seem down.

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,519
Oh, I wish I was that strong.

14
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:12,520
Lammy, you're already strong as is. You should be more confident. Nobody beats Lammy when she's on the guitar.

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Guitar stream.

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
But that is the truth.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Guitar warrior!

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:29,020
We are milk cans. With my son's beats, Lammy's guitar, and my almighty bass combined with that distinguished voice, there's nothing to be afraid of.

19
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,650
Square!

20
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,650
Yeah!

21
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,090
We're lunches for everyone, right?

22
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,090
Hey, that's ours. That's our food.

23
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:52,110
Not only lunches, but a little babe. All dressed up for us. Ain't that right?

24
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,110
Here.

25
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,419
Let's do that around the whole earth.

26
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:09,509
See? The guitar rules again.

27
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's go.

28
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,060
Gotta take it like a stage select.

29
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,060
Gotta make sure load and save, replay, mechanism replay, high score options.

30
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
Let's check it out.

31
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
Turn off the vibration subtitles.

32
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,060
What happened to this?

33
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh, okay, first I'm like, wait, how do you get bites in the middle?

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,870
Level normal.

35
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:04,750
Alright, let's do it.

36
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,750
New game.

37
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,340
It's not easy.

38
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,339
Easy? We thought the bite was on the normal.

39
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,939
What should I tell them?

40
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,939
I had a stomach ache, so I went to the b-b-bathroom.

41
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:31,939
But there was a long line at the gas station.

42
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,939
I told them it was an emergency, but they said,

43
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,439
Let's rap for it.

44
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:48,120
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
Good.

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,160
Does this go?

47
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Who's that?

48
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:09,300
And here's our best choc choc here.

49
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh, this is like the third game. I forgot to tell you this.

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,250
This is, Parappa the Rapper comes up, Parappa the Rapper 2, and then I'm Jammer Lang.

51
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,250
Just in case you want to know.

52
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,250
You're supposed to know who this is.

53
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:33,040
Let's go.

54
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,060
Oh, it's up top. It's up top.

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,060
Watch this.

56
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Oh, fuck.

57
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,879
Alright, I'll shut up.

58
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,629
Never get cool on easy.

59
00:05:46,629 --> 00:06:19,129
What are you targeting on?

60
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:34,170
Is L like an L? Which L?

61
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:45,029
There's two L's.

62
00:06:45,029 --> 00:07:02,439
There's two L's.

63
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,189
Oh, shit.

64
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,310
Oh, shit.

65
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,680
Oh, shit.

66
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Oh, shit.

67
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,480
There's two L's.

68
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,689
When you see L, I don't know if it was left on the D pad or L.

69
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,740
What, it was vacuum cleaned the whole time?

70
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,709
What the what?

71
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:03,269
Yeah, L2 didn't exist.

72
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:08,300
Listen.

73
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
I lost my dojo.

74
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I didn't get the bad one.

75
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
But the dojo remains in my mind.

76
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,600
It even has a casino.

77
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Dojo. Casino.

78
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,230
That's all in my mind.

79
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,230
I have nothing to lose.

80
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,709
Wait, L2 and R2 did exist.

81
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:36,679
Did they?

82
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,500
Back in PlayStation 1?

83
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,250
I remember them existing.

84
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,490
They did?

85
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,490
I have a PlayStation 1 controller literally behind me.

86
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,490
Let me check.

87
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:59,759
Why didn't I just plug that in?

88
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,759
Wait, I've had this. Wait, wait, wait.

89
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,320
Hold on. Could I have used this?

90
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
For Guitar-O-Man?

91
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,769
No, I couldn't have, right? It's not the same.

92
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:29,360
No, it's not the same input.

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:39,399
No, it's not, is it?

94
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,399
It is.

95
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,990
Oh, my fucking god.

96
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,990
This is an official PlayStation 1 controller.

97
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,990
I have an official PlayStation 1 controller in my hand.

98
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:57,309
PS1 doesn't have analog sticks.

99
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,309
This one does.

100
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,309
And they feel great.

101
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,350
I had one.

102
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,350
I had one right behind me.

103
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,350
I'm so infuriated.

104
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,350
I'm going back to Guitar-O-Man after this.

105
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,679
What happened to the Rome game?

106
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:34,960
This thing feels so much better.

107
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Fucking hell, I have this.

108
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,370
Whoa, whoa.

109
00:10:43,370 --> 00:11:03,470
Watch the electricity to the water.

110
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,460
What the fuck is going on here?

111
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,389
What's going on?

112
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:26,490
What?

113
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,559
Are you preventing us from...

114
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:46,720
Casino!

115
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,090
Is this a random person?

116
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:03,679
Let's go.

117
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,679
Everyone's gone crazy.

118
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:38,490
Gotta give it double sometimes.

119
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,980
Fuck.

120
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,450
Oh, that was a little better.

121
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,450
Freestyle, freestyle, here it comes.

122
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
Oh!

123
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,759
Freestyle!

124
00:14:22,759 --> 00:15:19,399
Dude, you guys are throwing freestyles, aren't you guys?

125
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:31,629
High score.

126
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:44,940
The second I put a fucking real controller in my hands...

127
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,940
Come on. Do the math.

128
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,440
Oh, not that pizza.

129
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Flanger?

130
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,049
What?

131
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,440
Why is this happening?

132
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,279
Wait, hold on a minute.

133
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,279
Hold on a second.

134
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,279
What?

135
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,279
What is going on?

136
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,279
I don't remember this.

137
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,279
She's pregnant?

138
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,720
I don't...

139
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
What?

140
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
What?

141
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
No.

142
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Oh my.

143
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,259
Are you in labor?

144
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,259
You don't need to worry anymore.

145
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,259
Get away from me.

146
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,950
What the fuck is going on?

147
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:42,400
Is this what it sounds like? I feel like I make this noise.

148
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I feel like I do this when I talk sometimes.

149
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Is this what it sounds like?

150
00:17:48,400 --> 00:18:09,099
I know.

151
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:17,150
Stop.

152
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,180
Disc scratch.

153
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:30,250
What happened?

154
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,250
I'm so confused.

155
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:43,119
Jesus.

156
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,119
I think something's wrong with

157
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:55,599
the disc.

158
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,599
I'm trying not to laugh that

159
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
hard because I'm having issues.

160
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,279
And

161
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,279
that was really difficult to not.

162
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,460
The disc is no longer spinning.

163
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,940
The disc is clean.

164
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,829
What's fucking going on?

165
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,829
Go back to the Rome

166
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:25,099
game.

167
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,289
This thing has damage?

168
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,289
There's no damage on

169
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,289
here. I'm just trying to buff it out.

170
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,839
It might pick up right where it left off.

171
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:49,240
And I don't have a save either.

172
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,680
Shit. No, I want to play

173
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,019
this. Come on.

174
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:59,019
No.

175
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:10,200
Why?

176
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Yeah, I have to restart it.

177
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
It's all right. I can get through those first. I want to play this.

178
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:21,880
This is fun. The PS2 is bricked.

179
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
No, it's not. Wait, can I go

180
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,119
into the browser?

181
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,119
Maybe it's something to do with the speed. Hold on a

182
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,240
second. Can't you do

183
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,480
something in the config file

184
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
and make it so it doesn't, like it spins the

185
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
PS, does something better?

186
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
It works harder or something?

187
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,970
Let me, I want to see. Is it

188
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,410
in here? No, no.

189
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:57,720
What am I doing? No, it's

190
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,970
not here. No, never mind. All right, let's try

191
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,509
it again.

192
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:14,599
Oh, man. That seriously

193
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:16,599
hurt my, yeah, it's not here.

194
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,599
I think it's just on automatically.

195
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,509
Well, I

196
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,509
have nothing really to say about what just happened. That was

197
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:27,390
that was fucking

198
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,759
bizarre. Is this even going to

199
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,900
read the disk now? Okay.

200
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:44,670
So we're going to skip that cutscene

201
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,670
when we get there. First of all, I'm going to destroy the first

202
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:54,859
two levels, you'll see.

203
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:56,859
Thank you, modest narcissist.

204
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:00,250
Modest narcissist for the

205
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,250
10th period of substance. Thank you.

206
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,319
But in the event that

207
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,319
that happens again.

208
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,319
Wait one second.

209
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,319
I'm getting the

210
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:30,759
up shit.

211
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,009
Really?

212
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,009
It's like another, I have to go. I'm going to skip

213
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,009
through the cutscenes.

214
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:47,390
Let's go.

215
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,329
Okay.

216
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,759
See if I can get cool on this one.

217
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,710
Isn't there a level select?

218
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,710
There is, but do you have to unlock them first?

219
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,430
Hold on.

220
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,369
I'll have to go back here and show you.

221
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,250
I don't have to do this again, do I? It's on normal.

222
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,809
Look. Vibration off.

223
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,809
Subtitles on normal.

224
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:31,309
Stage select.

225
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,039
Yeah, I can't.

226
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:43,390
Alright, let's go. Skip the

227
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,390
cutscenes so they don't break.

228
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:54,730
I have no idea where that is.

229
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,730
The last time I did an actual

230
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,730
PlayStation 1 stream

231
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,730
was like a year

232
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,730
and a half ago. It's somewhere in the

233
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,730
blocks.

234
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,730
Alright, let's get cool here.

235
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:43,640
Skyhide.

236
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,170
Skyhide.

237
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:41,369
No!

238
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,509
Come on!

239
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,640
Why?

240
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
Look what you are holding in your hand.

241
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
I don't know.

242
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,079
What is it?

243
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,079
I'll get the next one. The next one's a good one. I want to get the next one again anyway.

244
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,079
So it doesn't matter.

245
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,079
Save the game. Save the game. Save the game. Save the game.

246
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,079
Save the game. Save the game. Save the game. Save the game.

247
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:32,079
I can't.

248
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,079
I can't do it. I have a PlayStation 2

249
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:40,599
memory card. See?

250
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,599
I can't do it.

251
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,599
My PlayStation 1 memory card's like

252
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:46,599
buried somewhere.

253
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,559
I'll be fine. Postmates it.

254
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,559
No!

255
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,920
Go find it.

256
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,309
Watch this cutscene

257
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:03,609
while I look.

258
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:40,200
Got it.

259
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm putting it into slot one. No, I'm not going to touch. Yes I am.

260
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,640
Slot one.

261
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
I now have a PlayStation 1 memory card in there.

262
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh, I remember this song.

263
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
It's like great.

264
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
How is that bad?

265
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
What the fuck?

266
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,789
What the fuck? I did it last time.

267
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:36,430
What the fuck?

268
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,799
Rock out!

269
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:14,190
Come on! Give me some points!

270
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:37,420
Your expression changes.

271
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,750
That's terrifying.

272
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:58,349
Why are you doing this?

273
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:13,660
Please!

274
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,670
What?

275
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:28,240
CD's in my hand.

276
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
CD's in my hand.

277
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
CD's in my hand.

278
00:31:54,509 --> 00:32:07,420
Well, alright.

279
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,940
What's wrong with this thing?

280
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:18,880
It looks fine.

281
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:35,180
Uh oh.

282
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:43,180
I think our fun's over.

283
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,319
Plug in the PS1.

284
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:54,299
What? Again?

285
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,299
Again?

286
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,490
No!

287
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:18,750
Free style. Come on.

288
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,570
There it goes.

289
00:34:51,070 --> 00:35:07,260
Oh fuck, I just was spamming.

290
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,440
I can't do anything.

291
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:28,969
There's a 3000 IQ play here, guys.

292
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:35,579
3000 IQ play here.

293
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,760
I did that.

294
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
Because I wanted to get rid of the

295
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
opportunity for it to crash during

296
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
the actual game.

297
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
What?

298
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Only 3000 IQ?

299
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,860
That's pretty good.

300
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
For a god.

301
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
For a being that is just

302
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,860
stepping over every

303
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
single human bound.

304
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
You know what I mean? I'm boundless in my brain.

305
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:18,320
Alright, saved.

306
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Alright.

307
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,920
I'm going to skip this.

308
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,679
Don't skip

309
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,679
the cutscene for this one. What?

310
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,679
I have to. What if it

311
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,679
breaks?

312
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,679
It's going to get stuck again.

313
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:43,980
It's going to get stuck again.

314
00:36:43,980 --> 00:37:02,719
Skip it, please.

315
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,239
I can't. See?

316
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:13,239
I told you.

317
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:28,860
I opened the tray on purpose.

318
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,869
Because I wanted to be right.

319
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:45,309
What? Oh, a bird!

320
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:47,309
What? It's in the room.

321
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:50,510
Alright, that was fucking not even funny. Why did I do that?

322
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:58,440
Now I am being skipped.

323
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,360
It's the dry

324
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
laugh he does.

325
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Every stream. No, I don't do that every

326
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:16,329
stream. What if I can get

327
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,340
through this, are we? You're stuck here.

328
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
And I'm Jammer Lammy.

329
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:36,190
Alright.

330
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,190
We'll watch the whole thing. I'm going to close my eyes

331
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,750
and block my ears.

332
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,449
Tell me when it's over.

333
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:50,139
No. Why do they all

334
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:52,139
do this? I tried to go

335
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,139
down to the menu. Oh my god.

336
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,119
I hit down

337
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,119
to go to menu.

338
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,119
But it was on menu already.

339
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,039
Load, okay.

340
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,960
Load game. Load.

341
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,199
Alright. Apparently

342
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,199
it's been loaded. Stage select.

343
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,199
Level three.

344
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,630
Let's go.

345
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:43,099
Enjoy.

346
00:39:46,039 --> 00:39:48,039
Here, stock up on this pizza.

347
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,039
Stock up on this pizza.

348
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,039
Skip. You do

349
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,039
realize.

350
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,039
Guys, if I don't skip it,

351
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,039
half of everybody in here is going to

352
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,039
be very upset with me. If I

353
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,039
do skip it, half

354
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,039
of everybody is going to be very upset

355
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:15,420
with me. It's a double

356
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
it's just two edges to

357
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,849
the sword. No matter what happens,

358
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,849
I'm always going to get like cut by the

359
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:27,800
blade.

360
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:46,059
The sword of plus two and minus

361
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:48,059
two.

362
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:50,059
Skip the whole game. Why would I do that?

363
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:52,059
I purchased it specifically.

364
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,559
I hate this part.

365
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I hate this part.

366
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Alright, it's not skipping.

367
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,059
Okay, it's not

368
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,300
skipping.

369
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,690
Why? You didn't really have a baby, did you?

370
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,690
No!

371
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,690
No!

372
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,530
No!

373
00:41:47,530 --> 00:42:00,269
Skip it quick!

374
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:02,269
Why?

375
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,889
Alright, I'm going to, I'm washing the disc.

376
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,840
There's nothing, there's no scratches

377
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
on this disc. How do you

378
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,119
how do I wash something?

379
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:18,480
How do you wash this? Toothpaste.

380
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,719
Alright, we're going to toothpaste it.

381
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,360
Right? Is that how you do it?

382
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I'm going to put like a shirt on.

383
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
No, don't. That's not how you do it.

384
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,369
Wipe it with a cloth.

385
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:36,619
Alright, hold on. I'll be right back.

386
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:41,289
What the fuck? Oh my

387
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:43,289
god. Is the stream still on?

388
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:52,000
What the fuck is going on?

389
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Stop! Why do I

390
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,679
have this other controller here?

391
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,679
I have this other Playstation 2 controller that's

392
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,679
on my lap. It's been on my lap the whole time.

393
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,760
Okay, we're good.

394
00:43:03,760 --> 00:45:32,619
Alright, if this don't work, I don't

395
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:36,460
know what will.

396
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,829
I did peanut butter. You know, if you get gum

397
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:40,829
on your hair, you do peanut butter.

398
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:42,829
So, let's see if

399
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:56,010
it works. Well, I

400
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,010
had to do that because I don't have toothpaste.

401
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,010
I don't brush my teeth with toothpaste.

402
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,889
I don't even have a toothbrush.

403
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:09,480
So, I have a teething stick.

404
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,849
You know, like your dog chews

405
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,849
on like bone, I just chew on like a

406
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:16,219
teething bone. And then I hold

407
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:18,219
my mouth open in the shower just like this so that

408
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:20,219
my teeth out and just have it just fray my fucking face

409
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:25,150
really hard.

410
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,150
I just like, I chew on a bone.

411
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:44,349
Alright, here we go.

412
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:46,519
Which one is it on?

413
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,519
Why have I done this?

414
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,519
Does red mean highlighted?

415
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,519
Or does it green mean

416
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,519
highlighted? I've already fucked it up. Green is

417
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,889
highlighted, right?

418
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,889
Red is highlighted.

419
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:05,789
Okay. I'm skipping

420
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,789
that cutscene. We're not gonna give it a second.

421
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:15,130
Here we go. Don't even give it a

422
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,909
second. What do you mean don't

423
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:21,469
skip? I'm skipping it.

424
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:28,250
Done.

425
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,650
Goddamn broken ass

426
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,650
disk.

427
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,239
I'm getting the PlayStation 1. Stay right there.

428
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:48,480
What does this have for power?

429
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,969
Oh, I don't even know what that is.

430
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,969
I have no idea what the power is for this thing.

431
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:59,800
I have no idea.

432
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,300
It's a plug with a

433
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,730
yellow plug.

434
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,730
I don't even know what that looks like.

435
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:12,170
I want to continue playing it. I want

436
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,170
to play this. Where is it?

437
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,860
Come on. It's somewhere in here.

438
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,860
I just cleaned up two.

439
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:24,219
Oh.

440
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:26,219
I just cleaned it all up too and it's not. I don't know where it is.

441
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,769
Wait a minute. Is it this one?

442
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,010
What is this? No.

443
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,829
That's the Nintendo Switch.

444
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:52,440
What the fuck was that? Was it the PS2?

445
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,730
Do it on an emulator?

446
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,730
I mean, I gotta go

447
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,739
get an emulator.

448
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,739
I have to go get it and set up a

449
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,739
PlayStation 1 emulator?

450
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:08,940
Found it.

451
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,940
Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it. Found it.

452
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,940
I got it. Hold on.

453
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,420
Alright. Give me a minute.

454
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,659
This is going to be kind of

455
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,659
fucked up but let's go for it. Let's see if I can do this.

456
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,800
Hold on. Stay right there.

457
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
I'll be right back.

458
00:49:26,800 --> 00:50:28,559
That was pretty damn quick.

459
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,559
That was pretty damn

460
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,500
quick. Let's see if it

461
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:39,579
worked. Can you see? That was pretty

462
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:51,019
damn quick. Here we go.

463
00:50:51,019 --> 00:51:01,500
Let's go. Ah, blue.

464
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Don't skip. What are you?

465
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:09,070
Guys, I just hooked up an entire

466
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,070
new console in like

467
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,070
41 seconds.

468
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,369
That has to be some kind of record.

469
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:22,599
Has to be. Don't skip.

470
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:31,869
Alright. Here we go.

471
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:45,050
Shit. Wait.

472
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,019
It's already loaded. Right. Okay. Here we go.

473
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:51,019
Sharper too. This guy's playing on

474
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:53,019
original hardware.

475
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,440
I'm skipping it.

476
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,440
Let's go.

477
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:09,400
Let's go.

478
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,400
I'm killing it right now.

479
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:33,679
Let's go.

480
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:43,980
I'm killing it right now.

481
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:49,929
I'm killing it right now.

482
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:53,900
I'm killing it right now.

483
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,199
I got confused.

484
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:28,969
I got confused.

485
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:34,159
I got confused.

486
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,159
Diaper check. What's in there?

487
00:53:36,159 --> 00:54:03,400
Fuck.

488
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:17,230
The pit rate's going down.

489
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:20,940
The pit rate's going down.

490
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,940
What the fuck?

491
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,940
And she fucking pukes. I hate this thing.

492
00:54:40,329 --> 00:54:45,119
I swear.

493
00:54:45,119 --> 00:55:03,659
I want to do that one again.

494
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:19,639
Thank you. You got a little...

495
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,199
I only have eight more minutes.

496
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,699
Hates his viewers.

497
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,699
What are you talking about?

498
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:45,039
Let's see now.

499
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,039
Was it the green button

500
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,039
or the blue switch?

501
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,369
In there.

502
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,369
Have somebody seen?

503
00:55:57,369 --> 00:55:59,369
Where in the world were you, soldier?

504
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:01,369
Haven't you ever heard the term

505
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:03,369
punctual? In the Air Force,

506
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:05,369
a split second decision makes the difference

507
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,369
between life and death.

508
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:09,369
Don't you know?

509
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:12,000
Here we go.

510
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh, I kind of forgot

511
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
how to fly.

512
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Is it the best song?

513
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
See, I had to go

514
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
repair my denture a few days ago.

515
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,130
Boy,

516
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:32,110
I can eat almonds.

517
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,280
Look,

518
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,280
I told you we don't have all day.

519
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Get to work now, soldier.

520
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:45,000
This guy,

521
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
another one of those.

522
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,690
Casino?

523
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:28,349
It's a casino

524
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,349
airplane.

525
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:50,590
Come on, you can do it, PS1.

526
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:54,559
It's supposed to be

527
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,559
in there, come on.

528
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:08,829
Put it back in the PS2.

529
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:10,829
Oh,

530
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:12,829
fucking goddammit.

531
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:17,639
Did I save it before this one?

532
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:39,449
Come on!

533
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:48,159
PS1 for cutscenes

534
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,159
and PS2 for when you load it in.

535
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:16,829
Give me one second.

536
00:59:16,829 --> 00:59:20,480
Let's plug the power in.

537
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,480
Which one is the right cord?

538
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,480
I don't remember, it's this one.

539
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,019
Alright, back to the PS2.

540
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:38,280
Okay, let's go.

541
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:51,920
I'm going to plug that in.

542
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,329
I need the memory card, the controller,

543
00:59:56,329 --> 01:00:17,880
and let's go.

544
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
I had a save point right there,

545
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,440
so I'm just going to skip that cutscene

546
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,369
and see what happens.

547
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:30,250
Let's emulate it.

548
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,250
It would take like 30 minutes for me to set up an emulator.

549
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:34,489
It takes me 25 seconds

550
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:36,489
to switch consoles.

551
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:52,940
Let's see, here we go.

552
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,139
Stage left, stage four.

553
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:58,380
Skip.

554
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:21,210
Wait, we're rocking?

555
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,909
Alright, cool.

556
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,170
Let's go!

557
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,340
I fucked that up.

558
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,340
Uh-oh!

559
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,280
Uh-oh!

560
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:03,679
Get out of here!

561
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:51,289
And then I run out of oxygen.

562
01:03:51,289 --> 01:04:07,099
I kind of...

563
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:09,099
I kind of killed that one.

564
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:30,860
Save it.

565
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,860
That sounded absolutely awful.

566
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:52,699
Well, some adventure, hey?

567
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,260
Thanks.

568
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,260
I only have two minutes!

569
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,260
I only have three more minutes.

570
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,260
But close enough now.

571
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:11,559
Thanks, sir.

572
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:15,559
I think we got over all the problems.

573
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:22,989
Guitar! My guitar!

574
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:24,989
Where did I put it?

575
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,989
All the problems are gone, I think.

576
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,989
It was the middle of the game.

577
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:31,550
Oh, no!

578
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,920
I left it on the plane!

579
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,920
Hey, there's one.

580
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:43,980
A guitar.

581
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:51,469
What kind?

582
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,710
Well, um, a cool one.

583
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,710
An awesome sound and has reclining seats,

584
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,710
power steering and door airbags.

585
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:59,710
I don't have time for jokers!

586
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,710
Oh, no, no, no.

587
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,710
I'm sorry.

588
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,710
I just want one that's cool and cheap,

589
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,710
and of course the sound quality's gotta be superior.

590
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,710
Hmm, a greedy girl, ain't ya?

591
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,710
Oh, please!

592
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,710
I'll do anything, anything, please!

593
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:21,449
What?

594
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:23,449
Help! Go away!

595
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:26,909
You said anything, didn't ya?

596
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:28,909
You're going to kill me with a chainsaw.

597
01:06:28,909 --> 01:06:30,909
You're going to kill me with a chainsaw.

598
01:06:30,909 --> 01:06:32,909
Come on!

599
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:34,909
Let's make a guitar!

600
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,909
But, but I don't make a guitar.

601
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:42,219
Casino here, casino there.

602
01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:44,219
Casino in my hair.

603
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:52,119
Don't touch the top of that thing.

604
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:54,119
Get your hands away from the top of that.

605
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:56,119
It's not going to be good.

606
01:06:56,119 --> 01:07:33,869
Go.

607
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:35,869
Oh, shit!

608
01:07:35,869 --> 01:08:01,400
What happened?

609
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:27,560
Come on, bring it back.

610
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:52,699
I just tied the things in perfectly.

611
01:08:52,699 --> 01:09:18,750
Almost done.

612
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,319
Ah, fuck!

613
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,319
Back to the PS1.

614
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,319
What?

615
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,319
Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's drying.

616
01:09:42,319 --> 01:10:12,649
We're almost done with the song.

617
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:19,500
We're almost done with the song.

618
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
It's like this last line here.

619
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:29,500
Look it, it's done.

620
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,489
Come on, do it!

621
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:34,859
It's right there.

622
01:10:34,859 --> 01:10:43,180
Just grab the guitar and be done.

623
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:52,010
It's right there.

624
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:54,010
It's right here.

625
01:10:54,010 --> 01:11:17,420
Open track, close it quick.

626
01:11:17,420 --> 01:12:11,289
I'm only doing this one more fucking goddamn time.

627
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:14,359
I ain't doing this again.

628
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:16,359
This is the last time I'm doing this.

629
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:41,850
All the problems are gone.

630
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:43,850
They were though, they actually were.

631
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:50,760
Put in a backwards compatible PS3.

632
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,760
That's not going to do it.

633
01:12:52,760 --> 01:13:08,859
Here we go.

634
01:13:08,859 --> 01:13:10,859
Skip the cutscene fucking immediately.

635
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:12,859
You already saw it.

636
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:30,439
Go.

637
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,439
Please, PlayStation 1, do it.

638
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,779
What is it talking about?

639
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:33,439
I did it.

640
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:35,439
I'm not spamming.

641
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:13,630
It's almost like it takes too long

642
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:15,630
to get to the next note and you stop playing.

643
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:53,130
I really need to move on.

644
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,199
All right, we're good.

645
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,199
How many more levels are there in this game?

646
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,079
No, I don't think it's going to happen again.

647
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:22,079
This is like the last level.

648
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:42,989
There's no way it's going to happen again.

649
01:16:42,989 --> 01:16:47,079
This is the last level.

650
01:16:47,079 --> 01:16:49,079
This is the last level.

651
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:53,760
This is the last level.

652
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,760
There's no way it's going to happen again.

653
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:04,079
For one second, I thought it was happening again.

654
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:06,079
I thought that was actually happening again.

655
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,079
All right.

656
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:22,539
Straight to hell.

657
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,920
All right, so I went back in time.

658
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:00,960
Who thinks you are coming in this late?

659
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,579
Who thinks you are coming in this late?

660
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:05,579
Don't underestimate me just because I'm an idol.

661
01:18:05,579 --> 01:18:07,579
Don't underestimate me just because I'm an idol.

662
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:09,579
Come on, it's time to do it.

663
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:12,010
No, no, no, no, no.

664
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:14,010
You see, I was on my way to my own show,

665
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,010
but I ended up here.

666
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,010
How did that happen?

667
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:20,010
Anyways, I'll help you get to where you're going.

668
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:22,010
Where's hell?

669
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,010
Can you really do that?

670
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,010
Yeah, only if you play right.

671
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:28,010
Come on.

672
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,079
This is the original PlayStation 1 version.

673
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:33,079
This is the original PlayStation 1 version?

674
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:36,920
And A version.

675
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,479
Really?

676
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:41,479
Why would they censor hell?

677
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:51,770
Please, just do it.

678
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,770
Just do it.

679
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:57,229
Yes, all right, we're good.

680
01:18:57,229 --> 01:18:59,399
Let's get cool on this one.

681
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:01,399
That does not look very safe.

682
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:15,180
It looked right.

683
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:38,090
There's an electrocuting vehicle in the crowd.

684
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:40,270
There's an electrocuting vehicle in the crowd.

685
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:45,840
Electrocuting!

686
01:19:59,079 --> 01:20:10,279
I can't move it.

687
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,520
I can still go?

688
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:41,689
Even this one.

689
01:20:41,689 --> 01:20:45,210
Oh no.

690
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,960
Okay, let's go.

691
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Here we go.

692
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,960
No fucking around now.

693
01:20:51,960 --> 01:21:02,270
Check this out.

694
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:28,649
You guys don't understand.

695
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,189
Fuck.

696
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:02,189
You don't understand the song.

697
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:04,189
It's fucking weird.

698
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:10,199
The beat is off.

699
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:17,239
What the fuck?

700
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:19,239
I'm playing to a different song.

701
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:35,239
What did I do wrong there?

702
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:43,239
Huh?

703
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:52,060
What?

704
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,060
I'm pressing the button

705
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,060
when it goes over every time.

706
01:22:56,060 --> 01:23:12,039
What the fuck?

707
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:15,760
This one.

708
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
It's not the controller.

709
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:25,880
It's this shitty song.

710
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:39,239
That was so...

711
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:41,239
That was so fucking bad.

712
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:43,239
Explain to me.

713
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:45,239
That was the worst line I've ever done.

714
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,239
And I still won.

715
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,340
I still got it.

716
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,579
No.

717
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:55,579
I just wanted to pause the game.

718
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:57,579
Why can't you pause video games back in the year 2000?

719
01:23:57,579 --> 01:23:59,760
Why can't you not pause video games back in 1999?

720
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:12,880
It's cheating.

721
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,880
What if I have to go to the bathroom?

722
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,880
What if I'm about to beat the level and I'm going to shit my pants?

723
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:23,979
You have to hold it.

724
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:48,489
What is this song?

725
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:57,359
I hate this song.

726
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:26,029
Guys.

727
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:28,270
This song is dead.

728
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,680
Guys, seriously.

729
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,680
You don't understand.

730
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:45,680
Come on.

731
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,680
Bring it back. I don't want to do this again.

732
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:53,439
Come on.

733
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,930
Back up. Please.

734
01:25:55,930 --> 01:26:18,590
So bad.

735
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:41,439
Why was it worth points?

736
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:43,439
Yes. Yes. I did it.

737
01:26:50,699 --> 01:26:54,920
Unbanned.

738
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,920
I did it.

739
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:05,039
That was...

740
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:07,039
That song...

741
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,039
That was not a very good song for me.

742
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:11,920
I like that one.

743
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,920
That's all I heard.

744
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,920
I couldn't hear the words.

745
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,779
They put this crazy filter on some of these voices.

746
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:34,779
I can't even hear the words.

747
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,050
You took my job.

748
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,050
My watch is broken. My guitar strings broke.

749
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:49,050
My costume has wrinkles.

750
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:51,050
And I don't get any messages on my beeper.

751
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,739
Because of you.

752
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:55,739
Say what?

753
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:57,739
Let's see who's the better guitarist.

754
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,739
I'm really in a hurry.

755
01:27:59,739 --> 01:28:03,119
Some other day.

756
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,119
Follow me in.

757
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:12,350
Get back here.

758
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:14,350
Hey, check this out.

759
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:16,350
Live in concert.

760
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:18,350
Milk can. That's us.

761
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:21,680
That's right around the corner.

762
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,680
Uh-huh.

763
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,680
That's why we have to get going right now.

764
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,810
How does this look?

765
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:30,810
This has been a wild ride.

766
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,810
Well, what about this one?

767
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:34,810
But this kind of makes me look heavy.

768
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:36,810
You think this one's better?

769
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:47,130
That's it.

770
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:49,130
The band's logo's gotta be really big.

771
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:51,130
My picture doesn't have to stand out.

772
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,130
My picture doesn't have to stand out.

773
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:55,130
Oh, come on.

774
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:05,949
It reminds me of one of those

775
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:07,949
weird, like, fucked up YouTube kids videos.

776
01:29:07,949 --> 01:29:09,949
I'm really, really sorry. I got caught up in a lot of this.

777
01:29:12,189 --> 01:29:14,189
Okay, this is it.

778
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:16,189
Are you okay?

779
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:18,189
Oh, yeah. Milk can is always on my mind.

780
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:31,119
Lead it to Milk Can!

781
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:33,119
Was Parappa like this too?

782
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,119
I think it was.

783
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:42,220
Parappa being this dialed up to like

784
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:44,220
1,000.

785
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:47,930
Here we go.

786
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,960
Oh, here's the title song.

787
01:30:03,789 --> 01:30:12,489
Get up, get up.

788
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:30,029
That was awesome.

789
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:32,029
That was awesome.

790
01:30:50,649 --> 01:30:52,649
I missed that one.

791
01:30:52,649 --> 01:31:20,489
Something's confusing.

792
01:31:20,489 --> 01:31:22,489
What the fuck is my turn?

793
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,000
No.

794
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
That was fucking cheating.

795
01:31:59,689 --> 01:32:02,000
Last song.

796
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Wait, if I hold my hand on the PlayStation.

797
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Okay, I have to have one hand on the PlayStation.

798
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:21,229
Put your foot up there. Okay.

799
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:30,359
That's a good idea.

800
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:56,399
Come on!

801
01:32:56,399 --> 01:32:58,399
God damn it. I can hear it running.

802
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:38,359
Squared and doing it?

803
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:46,810
No, it's fucked.

804
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:50,840
This thing is fucked.

805
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:55,319
This is fucked up.

806
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:58,890
Was this the last song?

807
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,890
Do Megalovania? Hold on.

808
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:40,699
This is the last song, right?

809
01:34:40,699 --> 01:34:42,939
We just pretended that I did it.

810
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:44,939
Wait, movement.

811
01:34:44,939 --> 01:34:47,119
What if I just don't touch anything?

812
01:34:47,119 --> 01:35:03,630
We want the falls.

813
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,859
Come on.

814
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:14,220
Just be patient with it.

815
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:18,760
Turn the PlayStation one upside down.

816
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:27,020
What the fuck?

817
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:32,000
It's upside down.

818
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,979
It's not fair.

819
01:35:41,979 --> 01:35:48,489
It's not fair.

820
01:35:48,489 --> 01:35:51,369
Come on, stop.

821
01:35:51,369 --> 01:35:54,960
It worked for a second.

822
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:22,279
Ow!

823
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:24,279
The sucker baited me.

824
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:47,869
Oh, fuck.

825
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:52,840
This is not good.

826
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,840
Turn it back right side up.

827
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,090
What if I just move it?

828
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:02,720
I think I have to shake the PlayStation.

829
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,720
Just sway it back and forth.

830
01:37:21,529 --> 01:37:24,409
Okay, I'm almost there.

831
01:37:24,409 --> 01:37:26,409
This is going to get good.

832
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:48,439
Oh, my God.

833
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:50,439
Come on.

834
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:54,859
I don't want to...

835
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:57,800
No.

836
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:17,180
Do I get extra points?

837
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,180
Upside down again.

838
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:35,789
It's dead.

839
01:38:35,789 --> 01:38:38,350
Wait, okay. I have a plan.

840
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:40,649
I have a plan.

841
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:42,649
I have to get cool.

842
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:47,640
I have to get cool.

843
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,359
I have a plan.

844
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:53,359
It should work.

845
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:58,409
I think the controls are backwards.

846
01:39:00,409 --> 01:39:03,229
I know I can do this.

847
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:40,350
Doh!

848
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:30,479
I knew I was going to be able to do it.

849
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:32,479
I have to start over.

850
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:45,850
I have to get cool or it's not happening.

851
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:51,720
What?

852
01:40:51,720 --> 01:41:03,500
It worked last time. Okay, I'll get it.

853
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,420
I'm getting teased, my love is real neat

854
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,420
I'm trying to shift into gear

855
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:15,420
That's when I see you coming

856
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:26,189
Trying to sack myself

857
01:41:26,189 --> 01:41:43,210
Cause it seems like it's time to try to get downtown

858
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:49,880
I'm thinking I can get out now

859
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,880
Getting close, I'm just running, running around

860
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,630
To all the problems that I get through

861
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:53,319
When the times say no

862
01:42:53,319 --> 01:43:14,079
I'm getting teased, my love is real neat

863
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:19,390
I'm trying to shift into gear

864
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:33,689
I'm getting teased, my love is real neat

865
01:43:33,689 --> 01:43:35,689
Trying to sack myself

866
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:38,810
I'm getting teased, my love is real neat

867
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:43,590
Trying to shift into gear

868
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:47,149
That's when I see you coming

869
01:43:47,149 --> 01:43:50,149
Trying to get into gear

870
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:59,659
That's when I see you coming

871
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:11,840
Trying to sack myself

872
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:27,029
Cause it seems like it's time to try to get downtown

873
01:44:27,029 --> 01:44:44,319
Trying to get down town

874
01:44:44,319 --> 01:45:46,609
Come on! Getting cool is just like, you gotta just spam R.I.P. shit.

875
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:52,909
Burger Boy played Parack of the Rapper 1 and spammed every single group and got cool.

876
01:45:52,909 --> 01:45:56,619
Honestly, I don't stand a chance.

877
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:35,159
Get cool!

878
01:46:42,840 --> 01:47:02,989
Why?!

879
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:34,779
It's about to break!

880
01:47:34,779 --> 01:47:50,399
It's about to break!

881
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:52,960
I have to restart.

882
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,630
If I don't get cool on this one, I'm breaking the disk.

883
01:47:57,630 --> 01:48:00,930
Half of my life I'm going to save it because it's worth a month.

884
01:48:14,289 --> 01:48:16,289
Come on!

885
01:49:08,770 --> 01:49:10,770
That was it! That was it!

886
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:14,800
That was actually it.

887
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,800
I had to just do a huge thing there.

888
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,800
Here we go. I'll get it this time. This is the one.

889
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:29,510
Okay.

890
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:32,319
Sometimes you have to get super points.

891
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:38,920
With PlayStation 2, it's too late.

892
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:45,270
Yeah!

893
01:50:00,319 --> 01:51:04,180
Yeah!

894
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:06,180
Oh, fuck! No!

895
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:14,689
Did I miss the part?

896
01:51:14,689 --> 01:51:16,689
No! What are we doing back here?

897
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:19,000
What are we doing back here?

898
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,409
Just gotta get it again.

899
01:51:58,159 --> 01:52:00,159
Fighting against like a...

900
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:02,159
I'm going against the tide here, as they say.

901
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:08,869
Damn it.

902
01:52:08,869 --> 01:52:10,869
I even got cool too and then I wasn't cool enough to stay cool.

903
01:52:10,869 --> 01:52:14,520
Shit. I'm not breaking this disk.

904
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
It's a great game.

905
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,210
It was just sold to me

906
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:22,899
by some motherfucker

907
01:52:22,899 --> 01:52:24,899
that didn't tell me that it was broken.

908
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:33,859
I'll be like $50, please.

909
01:52:33,859 --> 01:52:41,159
Dickhead!

910
01:52:41,159 --> 01:52:49,670
I don't even know how much this was.

911
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:56,449
Somebody look it up.

912
01:52:56,449 --> 01:52:58,449
What's this going for right now?

913
01:52:58,449 --> 01:53:04,149
I had it too. Shit!

914
01:53:04,149 --> 01:53:06,149
Oh, I'm so disappointed.

915
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:08,710
It's okay. It's alright.

916
01:53:08,710 --> 01:53:10,710
It's alright. Don't worry.

917
01:53:10,710 --> 01:53:13,079
There's no reason to fret over that.

918
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:19,079
Shit!

919
01:53:19,079 --> 01:53:21,079
I would have had it the first time if it just didn't break.

920
01:53:21,079 --> 01:53:30,399
Okay.

921
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:34,500
This stream's gonna turn off here

922
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:36,500
in like 45 minutes.

923
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:50,069
I'm doing this is it.

924
01:53:50,069 --> 01:53:52,069
If it doesn't solve it here, just pretend I beat the game.

925
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:11,970
That's how long you're gonna play Dead Rising 1

926
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,970
given how bad it is.

927
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:15,970
Dead Rising 1's a great game. What are you talking about?

928
01:54:15,970 --> 01:54:25,619
Alright, let's see if we can do this.

929
01:54:25,619 --> 01:54:27,619
Waste of time, yeah.

930
01:54:27,619 --> 01:54:37,729
That's the kind of nature of this whole level, isn't it?

931
01:54:37,729 --> 01:54:39,729
So far.

932
01:54:39,729 --> 01:54:41,729
It's alright.

933
01:54:41,729 --> 01:54:43,729
I'm having a good time.

934
01:54:43,729 --> 01:54:45,729
This is the last level. No, it's not.

935
01:54:45,729 --> 01:54:47,729
Oh, fuck.

936
01:54:47,729 --> 01:54:55,279
The stream thumbnail is a blue screen.

937
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:09,960
Alright, let's see if for the last time

938
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,960
we hear this.

939
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Don't fuck it up, let's go!

940
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,000
I wanna see some Hawke Champ!

941
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It sucks.

942
01:55:38,000 --> 01:56:28,479
I passed it.

943
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:30,789
Alright, don't fuck it up. I passed it.

944
01:56:30,789 --> 01:56:32,789
I passed the glitching.

945
01:56:32,789 --> 01:57:00,500
No!

946
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:25,220
So, it flipped it on me.

947
01:57:25,220 --> 01:58:09,189
And I instantly lost, apparently.

948
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:11,189
So, it flipped it on me.

949
01:58:11,189 --> 01:58:15,140
So, it flipped it on me.

950
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:19,560
So, it flipped it on me.

951
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:21,560
And I instantly lost, apparently.

952
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:23,560
What a fucking trick.

953
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:25,560
Why?

954
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,560
I even got to cool for like

955
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:29,560
about 60 seconds.

956
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:31,560
Oh my god, why?

957
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,560
Why?

958
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:39,720
I'm about to leave.

959
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:41,720
I gotta go home. I already am home.

960
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:53,060
What was so wrong with that?

961
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:11,880
Is this what hell feels like? No, they censored that.

962
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:59,090
LR...

963
01:59:59,090 --> 02:00:01,909
What the fuck?

964
02:00:01,909 --> 02:00:03,909
That's so

965
02:00:03,909 --> 02:00:05,909
fucked up.

966
02:00:05,909 --> 02:00:08,600
That part is such a mess.

967
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,600
Even if I do it right.

968
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:14,439
It doesn't make sense.

969
02:00:17,189 --> 02:00:54,039
It's so slow.

970
02:00:54,039 --> 02:00:59,800
You motherfucker.

971
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:03,000
Hey!

972
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:21,750
Did you see that?

973
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:33,460
He had his fucking game now.

974
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:35,460
It was trying to fuck me over

975
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:38,659
at the very end of that.

976
02:01:38,659 --> 02:01:57,909
There he is.

977
02:01:57,909 --> 02:02:04,609
Okay, I did it.

978
02:02:11,329 --> 02:02:28,470
Wait, wait, wait.

979
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:30,470
I stopped dicking around earlier.

980
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:32,470
I had to change consoles

981
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:34,470
to stop the game from crashing.

982
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:36,470
I would have beat it the first time.

983
02:02:36,470 --> 02:02:42,739
What? I would have beat it the first time.

984
02:02:42,739 --> 02:02:44,739
I didn't mess around and have the game

985
02:02:44,739 --> 02:02:46,739
crash mid song.

986
02:02:46,739 --> 02:03:00,630
I was talking.

987
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:03,319
You couldn't hear me?

988
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:06,770
What is he saying?

989
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:08,770
Somebody said if only he stopped dicking around

990
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:11,270
in the beginning.

991
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:13,270
I have been trying

992
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:15,270
to switch consoles like

993
02:03:15,270 --> 02:03:27,300
five times.

994
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:37,800
You should have just had an emulator.

995
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,159
Illegal!

996
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:58,710
You should have overclocked

997
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:01,329
your Playstation 1.

998
02:04:01,329 --> 02:04:04,079
Alright, so let's see.

999
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:08,819
Wait, what's going on?

1000
02:04:08,819 --> 02:04:33,840
Why is this running at like two frames a second?

1001
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:45,359
He's made a 3D movie maker.

1002
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:51,720
Why is that the post credits thing?

1003
02:04:51,720 --> 02:05:06,739
Parappa?

1004
02:05:06,739 --> 02:05:08,739
I have a Parappa the Rapper one.

1005
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,560
What about you, PJ?

1006
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:42,560
I have a chocolate frosty

1007
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:44,560
and a cherry pie.

1008
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:46,560
No, no, no. I'm talking about Katie's Lime Show.

1009
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,560
What are you going to do?

1010
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:50,560
Oh, then I'll have six chocolate frosties

1011
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,560
and a large cherry pie.

1012
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:17,109
Here we go.

1013
02:06:17,109 --> 02:06:22,930
Yeah!

1014
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:46,930
Get the fuck out of my way!

1015
02:06:50,930 --> 02:06:52,930
Get the fuck out of my way!

1016
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:08,520
He needs to eat some fucking vegetables.

1017
02:08:25,489 --> 02:08:27,489
Then I'll pour me rain.

1018
02:08:29,729 --> 02:08:31,729
And just push the button.

1019
02:08:31,729 --> 02:08:33,729
Pour me rain.

1020
02:08:33,729 --> 02:08:35,909
Come. Then I'll come.

1021
02:08:35,909 --> 02:08:37,909
Then I'll come. Pour me rain.

1022
02:08:37,909 --> 02:08:39,909
Pour me rain. Then come.

1023
02:08:39,909 --> 02:08:42,340
Pour me push.

1024
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,340
Then I'll rain. Come.

1025
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
No, no, I gotta get out of here.

1026
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I have to leave now.

1027
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I have to leave now.

1028
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:10,979
No.

1029
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:12,979
No. No.

1030
02:09:12,979 --> 02:09:14,979
Alright, that's it.

1031
02:09:14,979 --> 02:09:16,979
That's it. That's it.

1032
02:09:16,979 --> 02:09:20,310
That's the stream. I'm out of here.

1033
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:22,310
My stomach hurts.

1034
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:27,170
I have to leave.

1035
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:29,170
No. Okay.

1036
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:31,409
I will see you tomorrow.

1037
02:09:31,409 --> 02:09:37,239
I have to...

1038
02:09:37,239 --> 02:09:39,409
As the term goes.

1039
02:09:39,409 --> 02:09:43,250
I gotta get out of here.

1040
02:09:43,250 --> 02:09:49,779
Thanks for watching everybody.

1041
02:09:49,779 --> 02:09:51,779
Unfortunately we ran into technical problems

1042
02:09:51,779 --> 02:09:55,300
I'm Jeremy Lammydisc.

1043
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:59,140
We'll be back tomorrow.

1044
02:09:59,140 --> 02:10:01,140
We're gonna play Tryin' Tomorrow

1045
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:04,069
with Star.

1046
02:10:04,069 --> 02:10:07,720
So that'll be just kind of a chill stream.

1047
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:09,720
Solving puzzles and shit.

1048
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:14,520
I think Ashley's gonna come too.

1049
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,520
So that should be a good one. And then

1050
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:18,520
we're gonna get away from the PlayStation

1051
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:20,520
1 and PlayStation 2 stuff. We're gonna play The Thing

1052
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,520
on probably Monday.

1053
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:29,430
So I'll see you guys later.

1054
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:31,430
Thanks for watching.

1055
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:34,550
This was a lot of fun.

1056
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,550
Guitar Man was awesome.

1057
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:38,979
This was fun too.

1058
02:10:38,979 --> 02:10:41,800
Hope you enjoyed yourselves. I'll see you guys

1059
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:44,930
tomorrow. Take care.

1060
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:47,680
If you're sticking around to do the bits.

1061
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:51,140
Hey look I gifted 100 subs again.

1062
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:55,810
We'll get to them. Tomorrow's stream

1063
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:57,810
by the way is gonna be starting

1064
02:10:57,810 --> 02:10:59,810
Actually no it'll be

1065
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:01,810
normal. Nevermind.

1066
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:03,810
For some reason I was like, no it will.

1067
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:06,689
Somewhere around 1 or 2 o'clock Pacific.

1068
02:11:06,689 --> 02:11:14,739
Dodge? What did I do?

1069
02:11:14,739 --> 02:11:21,640
Yeah this shit doesn't work.

1070
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:23,640
It kind of, it just

1071
02:11:23,640 --> 02:11:26,770
doesn't make any sense. It's all good though.

1072
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:28,770
Eventually I will fix this.

1073
02:11:28,770 --> 02:11:47,840
This stomach hurts.

1074
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,619
So.

1075
02:11:51,619 --> 02:11:54,560
God damn it. I don't know

1076
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,560
what to even say.

1077
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:04,500
What do you even say?

1078
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:09,109
Thank you from earlier.

1079
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:19,279
We had, what's wrong with chat?

1080
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:22,079
Nothing. Don't worry.

1081
02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:24,079
Don't look into it. Trust. Don't worry.

1082
02:12:24,079 --> 02:12:26,260
Freddie Dread had

1083
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:28,260
10,000 bits earlier. Thank you Freddie Dread.

1084
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:34,279
We caught it but just want to say

1085
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:36,960
thanks again.

1086
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,960
Daffy Jones thanks for the 500 bits.

1087
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:40,960
They say, please get well soon Jerma.

1088
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,960
Let us pray together for your swift recovery.

1089
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:44,960
Our boomer who streamed from Vegas

1090
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,960
ancient by thy name thy

1091
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,960
carnival come thy jokes be repeats

1092
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,960
on earth as it is in Jupiter

1093
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,960
give us this day our daily laughs and forgive us of our

1094
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,960
minus twos as we forgive thy late

1095
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:56,960
streams lead us not into Cox

1096
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,960
high speed internet but deliver us from

1097
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:02,159
yellow skin. Amen.

1098
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:06,840
Those of you that missed the beginning of the stream.

1099
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:10,100
I had a weird

1100
02:13:10,100 --> 02:13:12,100
scare today.

1101
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:14,340
That, just kind of have to go watch it.

1102
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:17,989
It's a long winded thing.

1103
02:13:17,989 --> 02:13:19,989
I can't even explain what it was.

1104
02:13:19,989 --> 02:13:23,000
It's too long.

1105
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,260
But thank you Daffy Jones. Appreciate that.

1106
02:13:26,260 --> 02:13:28,500
Tingy thanks for the 250. Jerma before

1107
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:30,500
you get the liver scan go to the grocery store

1108
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,500
buy the freshest liver you can and

1109
02:13:32,500 --> 02:13:34,500
get the doctor to scan that.

1110
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:36,500
He'll get back to you with healthy results and you'll feel better in no time.

1111
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:38,500
Those livers

1112
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:40,500
Those livers are dead.

1113
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:44,470
I don't think that's a good idea.

1114
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:53,670
But healthy. Deadly healthy.

1115
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:58,340
Thank you Tingy.

1116
02:13:58,340 --> 02:14:01,220
Thank you C4G for the 350.

1117
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:03,460
Guitarra Man was

1118
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:05,460
one of the first games I owned and I think the very first

1119
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:07,460
game I actually beat.

1120
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:09,460
I love this game and I can't wait to see you 100%

1121
02:14:09,460 --> 02:14:11,460
every level first try. And then they do the

1122
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:17,920
that's me face.

1123
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:21,829
It was fun. It was just maybe the

1124
02:14:21,829 --> 02:14:23,829
controller I was using. I still can't believe that I could have used

1125
02:14:23,829 --> 02:14:25,829
the Playstation 1 controller and it was right behind me the whole time.

1126
02:14:25,829 --> 02:14:27,829
It was just right under my nose.

1127
02:14:27,829 --> 02:14:30,710
Moo means Moo thanks for the 500

1128
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:32,710
bits Moo. Kim could probably

1129
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:34,710
save a lot of time and emotional labor

1130
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:36,710
by just buying one of those rubber jar toppers

1131
02:14:36,710 --> 02:14:38,710
if she needed jars opened.

1132
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:42,229
Yeah but then I can't be, I can't open it on stream

1133
02:14:42,229 --> 02:14:44,229
and look strong.

1134
02:14:44,229 --> 02:14:48,500
Hey Spooky Spitfire thanks

1135
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,500
for the 250. So first things first

1136
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,500
I'm done with Dark Souls 3

1137
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:54,500
on my run. I had beat Orphan first

1138
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:58,340
try. I don't know how you did that.

1139
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:00,340
I've never beaten Orphan before which is even more surprising.

1140
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:02,340
How do you beat Orphan first try?

1141
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:09,750
That shit is like impossible.

1142
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:11,750
They said also I had you muted

1143
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:13,750
your stream and played Ludwig's theme over

1144
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:15,750
it and it made the first music fight a million

1145
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:18,500
times better. Did it match

1146
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:26,180
up though? That's more important I think.

1147
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:28,479
Just don't get hit. Yeah but

1148
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:32,960
that's hard. Thank you Spooky Spitfire

1149
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:36,289
I appreciate it. Yeah Orphan of Kos

1150
02:15:36,289 --> 02:15:38,529
what do you think I was talking about?

1151
02:15:38,529 --> 02:15:42,880
Good luck for the rest of your

1152
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:46,979
you got anything else to do?

1153
02:15:46,979 --> 02:15:48,979
Oh you gotta do Sekiro now. Uh oh.

1154
02:15:48,979 --> 02:15:54,720
Good luck. Thank you back in for the 250.

1155
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,720
Thank you for streaming as always. You never cease to entertain.

1156
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:58,720
It's my birthday today and I want to thank

1157
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,720
Stevie the

1158
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:03,090
xEV

1159
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:05,090
for helping out. Also have a great one chat.

1160
02:16:05,090 --> 02:16:09,560
Alright. Happy birthday.

1161
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:13,699
Hope you had a good one.

1162
02:16:13,699 --> 02:16:17,539
And thanks Stevie for helping out.

1163
02:16:17,539 --> 02:16:21,890
Appreciate it. That guy Tag

1164
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:24,960
gave

1165
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,140
twenty dollars

1166
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:30,340
two thousand bits.

1167
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,030
They say Jerm hello Jerm this is

1168
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:35,030
one of my favorite games ever made.

1169
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:38,360
The PS2 version has iffy controls

1170
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
the PSP version does the best. I still

1171
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:43,299
play it to this day. It was awesome.

1172
02:16:43,299 --> 02:16:45,299
It was great. I mean back then

1173
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:47,479
that was

1174
02:16:47,479 --> 02:16:52,659
pretty well done. But thanks a lot Tag.

1175
02:16:52,659 --> 02:16:59,059
No not the Rome game.

1176
02:17:01,809 --> 02:17:08,719
Yeah the Rome game.

1177
02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:10,719
No he's talking about Gitarro man.

1178
02:17:10,719 --> 02:17:17,319
Cause there's a

1179
02:17:17,319 --> 02:17:21,540
should I? No.

1180
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:23,909
Rome game. Oh my fucking

1181
02:17:23,909 --> 02:17:30,819
god that's funny. Hamtaro

1182
02:17:30,819 --> 02:17:34,020
man? What are you guys

1183
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:37,600
talking about? Isn't that

1184
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:41,569
a hamster thing?

1185
02:17:41,569 --> 02:17:43,569
Anyways Tag thanks so much for the

1186
02:17:43,569 --> 02:17:45,569
twenty fucking dollars the two thousand bits.

1187
02:17:45,569 --> 02:17:55,860
Good to see you.

1188
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:57,860
I was watching the tip of the hat

1189
02:17:57,860 --> 02:18:01,190
stream for a little bit. Tried to throw you

1190
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:09,760
guys a host on Saturday. You guys

1191
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:11,760
did a great fucking thing so

1192
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:20,340
good on you guys. But that was Tag.

1193
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:22,340
And by the way

1194
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:24,340
go follow Tag. Please put

1195
02:18:24,340 --> 02:18:26,520
Tag's channel here.

1196
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:32,020
Really really really

1197
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:36,950
good dude. Alright I'll just do it.

1198
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:48,340
I got it right here. Oh somebody did it first.

1199
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:55,059
Who's today's top

1200
02:18:55,059 --> 02:19:00,500
subgifter? Me apparently.

1201
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,500
But thanks Tag.

1202
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:06,079
Go follow Tag if you don't.

1203
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:08,079
Vilemi right after that gave

1204
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:10,079
two thousand bits as well. Twenty dollars from

1205
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:12,079
Vilemi right after that too.

1206
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:14,079
Streamer is pretending to be bad.

1207
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:18,629
And then they do Jermis Sauer.

1208
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:20,629
He's pretending. He's always

1209
02:19:20,629 --> 02:19:22,629
pretending. That's just what he does. He just pretends

1210
02:19:22,629 --> 02:19:24,799
to miss keys.

1211
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:26,799
He pretends to

1212
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:28,799
get hit and fall off cliffs.

1213
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:30,799
That's what he does. He's a pretender.

1214
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:32,799
He's a liar. Don't trust

1215
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:34,799
him. Don't trust anything he says.

1216
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:42,600
No thank you though. Thanks for the

1217
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:44,600
twenty fucking dollars. Thank you

1218
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:46,600
Multitrip for the 250 worst sounding stream

1219
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:49,729
2019. I get it

1220
02:19:49,729 --> 02:19:51,729
because of the guitar. Okay.

1221
02:19:51,729 --> 02:19:53,909
Thanks for the 250. Appreciate it.

1222
02:19:53,909 --> 02:19:55,909
Debockery man thanks for the five hundred bits.

1223
02:19:55,909 --> 02:19:57,909
When's the Elite Beat Agent stream?

1224
02:19:57,909 --> 02:20:01,680
I need to compile a bunch of stuff

1225
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,690
for the DS.

1226
02:20:04,690 --> 02:20:07,190
And get it captured.

1227
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:09,559
I think there's a way you can mod a DS and have

1228
02:20:09,559 --> 02:20:14,930
it capturable. Because I know

1229
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:16,930
emulators exist and I have used them before.

1230
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:19,239
But there's something

1231
02:20:19,239 --> 02:20:21,239
different about them.

1232
02:20:21,239 --> 02:20:23,239
And sometimes it can be hard to set up.

1233
02:20:23,239 --> 02:20:25,239
Especially when you get towards the PS2, PS3 stuff.

1234
02:20:25,239 --> 02:20:28,120
I know that these games are all

1235
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:30,120
emulatable but I like playing on original

1236
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:32,479
hardware. I actually do like doing

1237
02:20:32,479 --> 02:20:34,479
it. It just kind of feels better

1238
02:20:34,479 --> 02:20:37,239
to me. Modding the DS

1239
02:20:37,239 --> 02:20:39,239
is a crime. It is?

1240
02:20:39,239 --> 02:20:47,159
Why? Wait I can't like put

1241
02:20:47,159 --> 02:20:49,159
a capture card in a DS? Why is that illegal?

1242
02:20:49,159 --> 02:20:58,629
Well, but I do

1243
02:20:58,629 --> 02:21:00,629
like playing on mostly if I can original

1244
02:21:00,629 --> 02:21:05,430
hardware. If it's possible.

1245
02:21:05,430 --> 02:21:10,799
Modifying the software.

1246
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:12,799
Well then I'll put my webcam at it. Whatever who cares.

1247
02:21:12,799 --> 02:21:14,799
We'll go back to like fucking 2009.

1248
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:23,829
Yet you got a fake PS2

1249
02:21:23,829 --> 02:21:25,829
controller. No I have a real PS1

1250
02:21:25,829 --> 02:21:27,829
controller back there but a fake PS2

1251
02:21:27,829 --> 02:21:29,829
controller because

1252
02:21:29,829 --> 02:21:32,200
that's what it came with. And I was

1253
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,200
too lazy to go get like the real play.

1254
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,200
It's a real PlayStation. It's just an off-brand

1255
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:43,940
one. Thank you debauchery man.

1256
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:45,940
Maybe at some point in the future.

1257
02:21:45,940 --> 02:21:48,309
We'll see. C4G thanks for the 250.

1258
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:50,309
I don't know how you managed to do that with your

1259
02:21:50,309 --> 02:21:52,309
wonky sticks but I'm glad we got to hear

1260
02:21:52,309 --> 02:21:54,309
all the bangers. Most of them anyways.

1261
02:21:54,309 --> 02:21:56,309
A couple of notes got lost in the process.

1262
02:21:56,309 --> 02:21:58,309
I really wish this got a re-release

1263
02:21:58,309 --> 02:22:00,309
for modern systems because I really love

1264
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:03,059
this game. Thanks for showing it.

1265
02:22:03,059 --> 02:22:05,059
I think the rhythm game is

1266
02:22:05,059 --> 02:22:07,059
due for a big comeback.

1267
02:22:07,059 --> 02:22:12,629
And I'm not talking about

1268
02:22:12,629 --> 02:22:16,790
Guitar Hero. I'm talking

1269
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:18,790
the original

1270
02:22:18,790 --> 02:22:21,280
rhythm game stuff.

1271
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:26,280
And it looks like the

1272
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,280
initial tremors are starting

1273
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:31,280
here. You've got Space Channel

1274
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,280
5 isn't that making a comeback?

1275
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:37,829
Isn't there a new rhythm heaven game?

1276
02:22:37,829 --> 02:22:39,829
Or didn't one just recently release

1277
02:22:39,829 --> 02:22:44,819
or one's coming out? Guitar

1278
02:22:44,819 --> 02:22:46,819
Hero 1 and 2 was fun. No I

1279
02:22:46,819 --> 02:22:48,819
mean those games were so much fun

1280
02:22:48,819 --> 02:22:50,819
but licensed video game

1281
02:22:50,819 --> 02:22:52,819
soundtracks. You know what I mean?

1282
02:22:52,819 --> 02:22:54,819
You're actually playing the guitar

1283
02:22:54,819 --> 02:22:56,819
to Van Halen.

1284
02:22:56,819 --> 02:22:58,819
Not a Parappa the Rappa style original

1285
02:22:58,819 --> 02:23:00,819
songs with a little fun

1286
02:23:00,819 --> 02:23:02,819
cute original storyline.

1287
02:23:02,819 --> 02:23:09,090
I think you'll see a little bit more of that

1288
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:14,850
comeback. It goes in cycles.

1289
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:17,920
Derma sounds so constipated.

1290
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:22,209
Look I know

1291
02:23:22,209 --> 02:23:24,209
that's like a meta joke

1292
02:23:24,209 --> 02:23:26,209
reference. That's a meta reference

1293
02:23:26,209 --> 02:23:28,209
to the fact that you found out today

1294
02:23:28,209 --> 02:23:30,209
that I'm on prescription grade

1295
02:23:30,209 --> 02:23:32,209
laxatives. I know that that's why

1296
02:23:32,209 --> 02:23:34,209
you're saying that. And you've

1297
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:36,209
turned it. You've turned the key here.

1298
02:23:36,209 --> 02:23:40,239
Now I'm angry. I'm angry with you.

1299
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:42,239
I'm angry with you.

1300
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:45,190
What do you care?

1301
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:49,329
First it's just like

1302
02:23:49,329 --> 02:23:51,329
what do I fucking care?

1303
02:23:51,329 --> 02:23:56,950
Nah I'm just kidding. Anyways

1304
02:23:56,950 --> 02:24:00,280
where were we? Over here.

1305
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:02,280
Snowflakes. Am I

1306
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:04,280
right? For 250 thanks for the 250.

1307
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:07,670
Yo Jeremy your streams have been a comfort

1308
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:09,670
of mine for a while. I made some

1309
02:24:09,670 --> 02:24:11,670
portraits of you and Kim cause why

1310
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:13,670
not? Here they are. I'll upload them to my Insta

1311
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:15,670
if you are still chill with that.

1312
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:19,059
Thanks for the laughs. Throw these into

1313
02:24:19,059 --> 02:24:21,059
the community content night channel.

1314
02:24:21,059 --> 02:24:28,659
Toss them in there.

1315
02:24:28,659 --> 02:24:30,659
We'll pull them out during that next night.

1316
02:24:30,659 --> 02:24:32,659
Which will probably be

1317
02:24:32,659 --> 02:24:39,110
pretty soon actually.

1318
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:41,110
Let me see. What day

1319
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:45,399
is it? Today's the 19th.

1320
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:47,829
I would probably say

1321
02:24:47,829 --> 02:24:49,829
somewhere. Maybe there's enough to do it

1322
02:24:49,829 --> 02:24:51,829
before Halloween.

1323
02:24:51,829 --> 02:25:03,459
It's possible.

1324
02:25:03,459 --> 02:25:05,959
Monday and then

1325
02:25:05,959 --> 02:25:08,959
24, 25, 26.

1326
02:25:11,329 --> 02:25:13,329
Let me see.

1327
02:25:13,329 --> 02:25:15,329
If I can't do it before

1328
02:25:15,329 --> 02:25:17,329
the Halloween stream happens. Then it'll be

1329
02:25:17,329 --> 02:25:19,329
early November for sure. But

1330
02:25:19,329 --> 02:25:21,510
those of you

1331
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:23,510
that I guess. I actually have to put this

1332
02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:25,510
down in the

1333
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:27,510
description down below.

1334
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:29,510
That artwork and videos

1335
02:25:29,510 --> 02:25:31,510
are not going to be opened at the end of

1336
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:33,510
streams anymore. They're going to go

1337
02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:35,510
into that Discord channel.

1338
02:25:35,510 --> 02:25:37,510
If you have anything that you want to

1339
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,510
show on stream, we do a community

1340
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:41,510
content night once a month.

1341
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:43,510
Where we compile all

1342
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:45,510
of them and we go through and we have a whole stream where

1343
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:47,510
everybody comes and hangs out there.

1344
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:50,000
Rather than have at the end of

1345
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
streams, you know

1346
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
30, 40, 50% of people will

1347
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
take off because obviously it's like oh the stream's

1348
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
over. I got all the shit I want to do and

1349
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
see you later. But that's, you know, that's fine, right?

1350
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
So

1351
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:05,459
that was kind of the idea is to have them

1352
02:26:05,459 --> 02:26:07,459
all compiled rather than have them open at

1353
02:26:07,459 --> 02:26:10,209
the end of the stream. But

1354
02:26:10,209 --> 02:26:12,209
please, please, please put them in that community content

1355
02:26:12,209 --> 02:26:14,209
on the Discord. If you don't know what the Discord is

1356
02:26:14,209 --> 02:26:16,209
it's right here. It's a public

1357
02:26:16,209 --> 02:26:19,600
open Discord. Join

1358
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,360
it. It's a great community.

1359
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:24,600
Look forward to seeing what you do. And make sure

1360
02:26:24,600 --> 02:26:26,600
you watermark all your shit

1361
02:26:26,600 --> 02:26:29,670
so I know who it's from. Very important.

1362
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:34,399
But thank you so much. I look forward to seeing it.

1363
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:39,520
Thank you for the 250.

1364
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:43,989
Really. Plank V2, thanks

1365
02:26:43,989 --> 02:26:45,989
for the 1100

1366
02:26:45,989 --> 02:26:47,989
bits. Fun fact,

1367
02:26:47,989 --> 02:26:49,989
gladiators didn't die every fight

1368
02:26:49,989 --> 02:26:51,989
because they were too expensive to replace.

1369
02:26:51,989 --> 02:27:01,379
It's a fact I guess. Is that true?

1370
02:27:01,379 --> 02:27:05,399
Interesting. Thank you Plank

1371
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:07,399
for the 11 dollars.

1372
02:27:07,399 --> 02:27:10,979
Look directly at the Discord channel when I do it next time?

1373
02:27:10,979 --> 02:27:14,309
Yeah, but then I have to like cap

1374
02:27:14,309 --> 02:27:16,309
Discord. And you

1375
02:27:16,309 --> 02:27:18,309
can't really like full screen Discord.

1376
02:27:18,309 --> 02:27:20,309
It's still messages that you have to open.

1377
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:22,309
And I'd rather just do it the way

1378
02:27:22,309 --> 02:27:27,559
that I did before. Gladiators weren't

1379
02:27:27,559 --> 02:27:30,370
real. What? Hey,

1380
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:32,370
Appleship, thanks for the 250. Hey man, I need to submit my

1381
02:27:32,370 --> 02:27:34,370
senior quote for the yearbook by the end of November.

1382
02:27:34,370 --> 02:27:36,370
Can you come up with one for me? Choose wisely.

1383
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:38,370
This will be my high school legacy forever.

1384
02:27:38,370 --> 02:27:43,479
Um, okay.

1385
02:27:43,479 --> 02:27:48,399
Use this one. Start the

1386
02:27:48,399 --> 02:27:53,840
quote. Keep your eyes on the prize.

1387
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:55,840
The road to success

1388
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:57,840
is always under construction.

1389
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:05,590
Pretty fucking goddamn good

1390
02:28:05,590 --> 02:28:14,229
if you ask me.

1391
02:28:14,229 --> 02:28:16,229
Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring,

1392
02:28:16,229 --> 02:28:18,229
boring, boring.

1393
02:28:18,229 --> 02:28:20,229
That's what my mother used to say to me.

1394
02:28:20,229 --> 02:28:22,399
That's a quote from my mother.

1395
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:24,399
You making fun of my mother?

1396
02:28:24,399 --> 02:28:26,399
You making fun of my mother? Mrs. Elberton?

1397
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:37,350
I didn't end quote yet.

1398
02:28:37,350 --> 02:28:40,610
Oh, well, end it.

1399
02:28:40,610 --> 02:28:42,920
There.

1400
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:47,590
That's not a good quote.

1401
02:28:47,590 --> 02:28:49,590
That's not a good quote.

1402
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:51,590
That's too long for a yearbook.

1403
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:57,670
You can't use that

1404
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:59,670
one. Use the first part of that that I said.

1405
02:28:59,670 --> 02:29:01,670
Not the other end of it.

1406
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:05,190
Oh god. Well, anyways,

1407
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:07,489
congratulations.

1408
02:29:07,489 --> 02:29:10,120
Take care. Thank you, Appleship.

1409
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:16,000
Hey!

1410
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Heavy Min, thanks for the

1411
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
500 bits. I would absolutely love to see you play Dead

1412
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Rising, genuinely my favorite game of all

1413
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
time. I even did all the awful

1414
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
awful achievements for it, including the survive

1415
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
for 14 literal hours

1416
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,690
by doing nothing one.

1417
02:29:30,690 --> 02:29:32,690
That's gonna be a really, really

1418
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:34,690
fun stream.

1419
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:36,690
Because don't you have to make choices on who

1420
02:29:36,690 --> 02:29:38,690
survives and stuff?

1421
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:45,090
And it's a time limit, right?

1422
02:29:45,090 --> 02:29:47,719
Yeah, that's gonna be a ton of fun.

1423
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:54,309
I'm gonna do that sooner rather than later.

1424
02:29:54,309 --> 02:29:56,610
That might end up happening before Halloween.

1425
02:29:56,610 --> 02:30:02,180
I've never played it. I've seen people

1426
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:04,680
play that game. And me and

1427
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:06,680
Star played Dead Rising 2?

1428
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:08,680
Dead Rising 3? But we didn't even get

1429
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:10,920
out of the fucking first room.

1430
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:12,920
I think we made it 10 minutes into

1431
02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:14,920
the game and we were just throwing shit at each other.

1432
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:19,010
I don't remember. There's a video on it.

1433
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:21,379
I think it was 2. Yeah, I've never played the first one.

1434
02:30:21,379 --> 02:30:29,510
I've played Dead Rising 3

1435
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:32,579
as well. I've played every

1436
02:30:32,579 --> 02:30:34,579
Dead Rising game for like 2 hours each.

1437
02:30:34,579 --> 02:30:36,579
Except for the first one.

1438
02:30:36,579 --> 02:30:40,799
Dead Rising 4? I don't even remember

1439
02:30:40,799 --> 02:30:42,979
which one it was. Hey, Master

1440
02:30:42,979 --> 02:30:44,979
Chicken, thanks for the 1500 bits. 15 bucks

1441
02:30:44,979 --> 02:30:46,979
from Master Chicken, thank you.

1442
02:30:46,979 --> 02:30:48,979
Jeremiah, I almost pissed my pants when the disc started skipping.

1443
02:30:48,979 --> 02:30:50,979
There are tears pouring down my face.

1444
02:30:50,979 --> 02:30:54,239
I mean, it was fucking crazy.

1445
02:30:54,239 --> 02:30:56,239
So, I...

1446
02:30:56,239 --> 02:31:03,159
Hopefully you're alright.

1447
02:31:03,159 --> 02:31:05,159
Thank you to Funky Chicken for the 300 bits.

1448
02:31:05,159 --> 02:31:07,159
If Steve is short

1449
02:31:07,159 --> 02:31:09,159
for Stevious,

1450
02:31:09,159 --> 02:31:11,159
then Jerma is short for a

1451
02:31:11,159 --> 02:31:22,420
34-year-old man.

1452
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:25,430
Nice. Got him. Yeah.

1453
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:28,819
I mean, I'm gonna read it.

1454
02:31:28,819 --> 02:31:32,790
Whatever. I don't care.

1455
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:34,790
Thank you JVibs for the

1456
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:36,790
500 bits. Hey, Jerma, it's Josh.

1457
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:38,790
We met in Las Vegas.

1458
02:31:38,790 --> 02:31:40,790
I finally used the Prime sub

1459
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:42,790
like I promised. Keep on going strong.

1460
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:45,780
I do remember that.

1461
02:31:45,780 --> 02:31:48,469
Kim and I were out to dinner.

1462
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:50,469
We were trying to find new

1463
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:54,440
places to go.

1464
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:56,440
And this dude walked up to us.

1465
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,440
By the way, this was like

1466
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:04,000
last week.

1467
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,290
No, not VR, Josh.

1468
02:32:08,290 --> 02:32:10,290
Kim and I were like, oh, where do you want to go?

1469
02:32:10,290 --> 02:32:12,290
Let's try some new places we fucking don't go.

1470
02:32:12,290 --> 02:32:16,559
I was like, oh, what about here?

1471
02:32:16,559 --> 02:32:19,059
How about here? How about there?

1472
02:32:19,059 --> 02:32:21,879
And then he flashed you.

1473
02:32:21,879 --> 02:32:27,829
No, that did not happen.

1474
02:32:27,829 --> 02:32:36,340
New places.

1475
02:32:36,340 --> 02:32:38,340
Right? The Vegas buffet is worst to best.

1476
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:41,219
There's like

1477
02:32:41,219 --> 02:32:44,100
700 of them.

1478
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:51,719
I can't do that.

1479
02:32:51,719 --> 02:32:54,340
Here's the thing about Vegas though.

1480
02:32:54,340 --> 02:32:56,579
Vegas has more restaurants and more places to eat

1481
02:32:56,579 --> 02:32:58,579
than any place I've ever been on Earth.

1482
02:32:58,579 --> 02:33:01,780
There are probably like

1483
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:03,780
2,000 restaurants in Las Vegas.

1484
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:06,600
It's fucking crazy.

1485
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:09,600
It's overwhelming.

1486
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,600
And they're all good.

1487
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:13,600
They're all good except for, well, hold on.

1488
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:22,549
I don't want to get ahead of myself there.

1489
02:33:22,549 --> 02:33:24,549
Do I have a Yeti restaurant?

1490
02:33:24,549 --> 02:33:27,620
Hash House to Go Go is the best restaurant I've ever been to.

1491
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:29,799
In Vegas.

1492
02:33:29,799 --> 02:33:32,790
That's in the link.

1493
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:34,790
Please, please go if you're ever in Vegas.

1494
02:33:34,790 --> 02:33:40,549
Do a Vegas restaurant tier list.

1495
02:33:40,549 --> 02:33:42,549
It would not happen.

1496
02:33:42,549 --> 02:33:45,620
But anyways, no, I do remember Kim and I were just like

1497
02:33:45,620 --> 02:33:47,620
walking around and it was just like, hey,

1498
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:51,250
what's up?

1499
02:33:51,250 --> 02:33:53,250
And you used the prime sub like you promised.

1500
02:33:53,250 --> 02:33:55,809
That's fucking awesome.

1501
02:33:55,809 --> 02:33:57,809
It was a pleasure.

1502
02:33:57,809 --> 02:34:03,829
I was just saying hello, seriously.

1503
02:34:03,829 --> 02:34:05,829
Hope you had a good rest of your trip.

1504
02:34:05,829 --> 02:34:08,959
I know that you were on a trip.

1505
02:34:08,959 --> 02:34:12,040
You were just going to stop it in and

1506
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:14,280
demand a sub from the guy.

1507
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:18,879
No, that's not what happened.

1508
02:34:18,879 --> 02:34:21,319
Now, if anybody ever sees me,

1509
02:34:21,319 --> 02:34:23,319
and look, I know that

1510
02:34:23,319 --> 02:34:25,319
I currently live

1511
02:34:25,319 --> 02:34:27,879
in a destination city.

1512
02:34:27,879 --> 02:34:29,879
And there are a lot of places

1513
02:34:29,879 --> 02:34:31,879
that you could potentially just see me

1514
02:34:31,879 --> 02:34:34,239
because there's so much to do here.

1515
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:37,510
There's a bunch

1516
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:39,510
of stuff to do on strip. There's a bunch of stuff off

1517
02:34:39,510 --> 02:34:41,510
strip. There's a bunch of stuff downtown

1518
02:34:41,510 --> 02:34:43,510
and some of the other areas and towns

1519
02:34:43,510 --> 02:34:45,510
and communities and stuff.

1520
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:47,680
So I know that there's a lot of

1521
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,920
people that go to Vegas all the time.

1522
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:51,920
People have said already

1523
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,700
that, hey, I'm going to be in Vegas.

1524
02:34:55,700 --> 02:34:57,700
I'm going to be in Vegas. I'm going to be in Vegas. So if

1525
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:59,700
you end up just seeing me somewhere,

1526
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:04,120
do not hesitate to just say hello.

1527
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:06,290
It's not going to bother me. Don't worry

1528
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:16,399
about that. I was there in September, but I

1529
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:21,590
didn't see him. What if I try

1530
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:23,829
to bother you? Well, then

1531
02:35:23,829 --> 02:35:25,829
I will get security.

1532
02:35:25,829 --> 02:35:28,959
They're everywhere.

1533
02:35:28,959 --> 02:35:30,959
I will just go,

1534
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:32,959
excuse me, sir.

1535
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:34,959
This person's trying to bother me.

1536
02:35:34,959 --> 02:35:39,319
What do you mean he hates us? Somebody just

1537
02:35:39,319 --> 02:35:41,319
said, what if I was trying to bother

1538
02:35:41,319 --> 02:35:43,559
you? What does that mean?

1539
02:35:43,559 --> 02:35:46,629
What does that mean? That means you're trying to bother

1540
02:35:46,629 --> 02:35:48,629
me. Shouldn't I be like, hey, security?

1541
02:35:48,629 --> 02:35:55,920
What does that even mean?

1542
02:35:55,920 --> 02:36:01,430
Psycho

1543
02:36:01,430 --> 02:36:03,430
Streamer throws fans out from

1544
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:10,020
the strip. Well, if you're going to

1545
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:12,020
be like a dick

1546
02:36:12,020 --> 02:36:14,020

02:36:14,020 --> 02:36:16,020

02:36:18,020 --> 02:36:20,020
away from me. Like, oh, get the fuck out

1550
02:36:20,020 --> 02:36:23,799
of here. What do you want me to do?

1551
02:36:23,799 --> 02:36:25,799
What? That's like a

1552
02:36:25,799 --> 02:36:27,799
basic human thing.

1553
02:36:27,799 --> 02:36:29,799
If somebody walked up to you and was

1554
02:36:29,799 --> 02:36:31,799
like grabbing you and like fucking

1555
02:36:31,799 --> 02:36:33,799
screaming in your face and like peeking from

1556
02:36:33,799 --> 02:36:35,799
behind corners and like hiding from

1557
02:36:35,799 --> 02:36:37,799
you, looking at you to be like,

1558
02:36:37,799 --> 02:36:39,799
yeah, I'm coming

1559
02:36:39,799 --> 02:36:41,969

02:36:41,969 --> 02:36:44,280
like, um, can

02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:57,459
somebody help me here, please?

1562
02:36:57,459 --> 02:36:59,459
I'll call security on you.

1563
02:36:59,459 --> 02:37:04,180
That's not how it works.

1564
02:37:04,180 --> 02:37:06,180
Anyways, let's put the credits on. But

1565
02:37:06,180 --> 02:37:08,180
no, long story short, if you do see me out,

1566
02:37:08,180 --> 02:37:10,930
you know, if like me and Kim are like

1567
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:12,930
trying a new restaurant or something and you see

1568
02:37:12,930 --> 02:37:14,930
us at the restaurant, then fucking

1569
02:37:14,930 --> 02:37:16,930
whatever. Just come say hello.

1570
02:37:16,930 --> 02:37:21,350
I'm totally alright with that.

1571
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:28,840
Shout out to my favorite centipede

1572
02:37:28,840 --> 02:37:30,840
stream. What do you mean centipede?

1573
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:40,159
What the fuck does that mean? Wormo.

1574
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:43,620
Oh. Anyways, here come the credits.

1575
02:37:43,620 --> 02:37:46,049
Uh, thanks everybody for

1576
02:37:46,049 --> 02:37:48,049
your support, your continued support.

1577
02:37:48,049 --> 02:37:50,049
It means a fucking shitload.

1578
02:37:50,049 --> 02:37:52,049
Gotta bump ya. Sorry.

1579
02:37:52,049 --> 02:37:55,319
Oh fuck, I thought that was a webcam.

1580
02:37:55,319 --> 02:37:58,389
And I don't have any clothes on.

1581
02:37:58,389 --> 02:38:05,799
Alright, I'm good.

1582
02:38:05,799 --> 02:38:07,799
We're not watching the frog video again.

1583
02:38:07,799 --> 02:38:13,409
What you are gonna watch is

1584
02:38:13,409 --> 02:38:15,409
you're gonna watch this pop up.

1585
02:38:15,409 --> 02:38:22,049
Thanks everybody.

1586
02:38:22,049 --> 02:38:24,049
A couple more bits to do we have.

1587
02:38:24,049 --> 02:38:26,049
The ball of koala thanks to the five

1588
02:38:26,049 --> 02:38:28,049
hundred bits. Five fifty actually.

1589
02:38:28,049 --> 02:38:30,049
Hey Jerma put my broken

1591
02:38:32,049 --> 02:38:34,049
and some idiot actually bought it.

1592
02:38:34,049 --> 02:38:37,440
Laughing my ass off, I scammed him.

1593
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:44,870
Thanks. Well, enjoy your

1594
02:38:44,870 --> 02:38:46,870
like forty eight dollars,

1595
02:38:46,870 --> 02:38:49,750
whatever this was. I don't even remember.

1596
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:53,139
Hey gnarly, thanks for the two fifty.

1597
02:38:53,139 --> 02:38:55,139
Hey, just making sure you met your quota for one

1598
02:38:55,139 --> 02:38:58,340
reference per stream of a certain

1599
02:38:58,340 --> 02:39:00,340
thing. I didn't hear one yet and

1600
02:39:00,340 --> 02:39:02,340
I don't want you to break your three year streak.

1601
02:39:02,340 --> 02:39:11,989
Not gonna happen. Thank you Freudian

1602
02:39:11,989 --> 02:39:13,989
Weapon for the five hundred bits.

1603
02:39:13,989 --> 02:39:20,959
Thank you. The game glitching out made

1604
02:39:20,959 --> 02:39:22,959
my night. My bro and I laughed so hard our heads

1605
02:39:22,959 --> 02:39:26,229
were hurting so thanks for the laughs.

1606
02:39:26,229 --> 02:39:31,799
I mean it was a shit show. I already

1607
02:39:31,799 --> 02:39:33,799
forgot your name, how to pronounce

1608
02:39:33,799 --> 02:39:36,610
it. I'm so sorry.

1609
02:39:36,610 --> 02:39:38,610
I remember like two days ago

1610
02:39:38,610 --> 02:39:40,610
I was corrected on this.

1611
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:42,610
It's Czexin

1612
02:39:42,610 --> 02:39:44,610
S and I've already

1613
02:39:44,610 --> 02:39:50,930
forgot it. I don't remember.

1614
02:39:50,930 --> 02:39:55,540
Czexin? Czexin?

1615
02:39:55,540 --> 02:39:58,229
It was Czexin. Okay, right.

1616
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:00,469
Right. Czexin.

1617
02:40:00,469 --> 02:40:03,280
I will remember next time, I promise.

1618
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:05,280
Czexin gave five community subs.

1619
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:09,569
Thanks for the five subs, Czexin.

1620
02:40:09,569 --> 02:40:12,840
And then we had don't start

1621
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:14,840
let me

1622
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:17,079
for the five hundred and fifty

1623
02:40:17,079 --> 02:40:19,079
bits. Play the yeti game, you'll get yeti

1624
02:40:19,079 --> 02:40:21,250
nightmares. I don't

1625
02:40:21,250 --> 02:40:24,579
know what that is. Why

1626
02:40:24,579 --> 02:40:29,889
is there a Terminator emote? Why is there

1627
02:40:29,889 --> 02:40:31,889
a Terminator emote? That's like not

1628
02:40:31,889 --> 02:40:33,889
even the Terminator. That's like the Mortal

1629
02:40:33,889 --> 02:40:35,889
Combat DLC Terminator.

1630
02:40:35,889 --> 02:40:40,559
DinoPulseZetta

1631
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:42,559
thanks for the five community subs

1632
02:40:42,559 --> 02:40:44,559
right now. Thank you.

1633
02:40:44,559 --> 02:40:52,549
Appreciate it. Thanks for the five subs.

1634
02:40:52,549 --> 02:40:55,299
Ishanji

1635
02:40:55,299 --> 02:40:57,299
thanks for the two thousand bits

1636
02:40:57,299 --> 02:40:59,299
twenty dollars. Hey funny streamer

1637
02:40:59,299 --> 02:41:01,299
Jeremy. Love your streams.

1638
02:41:01,299 --> 02:41:03,299
Never seen anyone so determined to finish a physically defective

1639
02:41:03,299 --> 02:41:05,479
game before. Well I

1640
02:41:05,479 --> 02:41:08,610
bought it. Yeah look

1641
02:41:08,610 --> 02:41:10,610
okay hold on. It's real easy to be like

1642
02:41:10,610 --> 02:41:12,610
just like skip this one.

1643
02:41:12,610 --> 02:41:14,920
Just throw it in the trash.

1644
02:41:14,920 --> 02:41:17,219
Break it. Burn it. I

1645
02:41:17,219 --> 02:41:19,219
bought this game. I don't want to just like

1646
02:41:19,219 --> 02:41:21,219
break it.

1647
02:41:21,219 --> 02:41:23,459
I mean if it was Guy Fieri

1648
02:41:23,459 --> 02:41:25,459
the Guy Fieri game who cares?

1649
02:41:25,459 --> 02:41:31,479
I've just

1650
02:41:31,479 --> 02:41:33,479
look I've only destroyed

1651
02:41:33,479 --> 02:41:35,479
two or three games on stream ever in

1652
02:41:35,479 --> 02:41:37,479
like six years. Eight. No like

1653
02:41:37,479 --> 02:41:39,840
ten years. The Guy Fieri

1654
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,079
minute to win it game

1655
02:41:42,079 --> 02:41:44,260
I shredded. Okay?

1656
02:41:44,260 --> 02:41:46,260
Which by the way do not do that. Don't try that

1657
02:41:46,260 --> 02:41:48,260
at home. It's not safe. Do not shred

1658
02:41:48,260 --> 02:41:50,260
anything that unless

1659
02:41:50,260 --> 02:41:52,260
you are certain that it is a

1660
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:54,260
shredder that is capable of doing what you are trying

1661
02:41:54,260 --> 02:41:56,260
to do. Read the instructions.

1662
02:41:56,260 --> 02:41:58,629
Don't do that at home first of all.

1663
02:41:58,629 --> 02:42:00,629
Second of all Army of Two

1664
02:42:00,629 --> 02:42:02,629
was the other one that I broke in half.

1665
02:42:02,629 --> 02:42:08,319
I've never broken another game

1666
02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:10,559
on stream in at least in

1667
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:12,559
the four and a half years plus that I've done this.

1668
02:42:12,559 --> 02:42:17,680
So come on I don't break

1669
02:42:17,680 --> 02:42:24,600
games. And then so the

1670
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:26,840
second part here

1671
02:42:26,840 --> 02:42:28,840
any chance you'll stream tale of the sun

1672
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:30,840
someday. It's a PS1

1673
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:32,840
caveman simulator where you try to build

1674
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:34,840
a tower to the sun out of mammoth

1675
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:37,459
bones. Well you

1676
02:42:37,459 --> 02:42:39,459
just put a new game on the list.

1677
02:42:39,459 --> 02:42:43,110
And they say one of the more unique games on

1678
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:45,110
the system. Also here's a clip to commemorate

1679
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:47,110
your legendary freestyle today.

1680
02:42:47,110 --> 02:42:50,760
Your legendary freestyle

1681
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:59,010
today. What was my

1682
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:01,010
legendary freestyle?

1683
02:43:01,010 --> 02:43:03,639
Then I'll come

1684
02:43:03,639 --> 02:43:05,639
Then I'll come

1685
02:43:05,639 --> 02:43:08,260
Oh right

1686
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:10,500
right. We don't have to

1687
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:13,510
listen to this. It happened already.

1688
02:43:13,510 --> 02:43:16,579
Thanks.

1689
02:43:16,579 --> 02:43:21,430
We don't have to listen to that.

1690
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:23,989
Thanks for the

1691
02:43:23,989 --> 02:43:25,989
20

1692
02:43:25,989 --> 02:43:27,989
Thanks for the 20 dollars seriously. 2,000 bits.

1693
02:43:27,989 --> 02:43:31,120
And I'll put that on the list, tale of the sun.

1694
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,120
Next time I'll do some PS1 stuff for sure.

1695
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:36,639
Sir Canine, thanks for the

1696
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:40,610
500 bits. They say

1697
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:42,610
Hey Jeremy, here's a funny video.

1698
02:43:42,610 --> 02:43:45,430
Videos go in the

1699
02:43:45,430 --> 02:43:47,430
community content night.

1700
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:49,430
If it's about the community. But I know it's not.

1701
02:43:49,430 --> 02:43:51,670
Because I have

1702
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:53,840
memorized the like

1703
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:55,840
first five

1704
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:58,020
letters of this link.

1705
02:43:58,020 --> 02:44:00,020
And I know what it is. It is this.

1706
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:03,989
I know what it is already.

1707
02:44:03,989 --> 02:44:10,629
So that's fine.

1708
02:44:10,629 --> 02:44:17,270
I'm prepared. But thank you

1709
02:44:17,270 --> 02:44:19,270
Sir Canine for the five dollars. And then finally

1710
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:21,700
Colusia, thank you for the 300

1711
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:24,520
bits. The stream made me laugh so hard my

1712
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:26,520
sides are killing me. Thank you Jerma. Also here's a picture

1713
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:28,520
of my cat cuddling my

1714
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:31,459
Andy Mark Goat. What the

1715
02:44:31,459 --> 02:44:42,020
what the fuck? Hold on.

1716
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:47,250
Holy shit.

1717
02:44:47,250 --> 02:45:08,049
Look. So sleepy.

1718
02:45:08,049 --> 02:45:10,680
That's cute. That's

1719
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:13,680
really cute. Well thank you for this.

1720
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:17,079
This is great.

1721
02:45:17,079 --> 02:45:24,290
Sleepy.

1722
02:45:24,290 --> 02:45:26,719
Thanks a lot though. Seriously.

1723
02:45:26,719 --> 02:45:28,719
And that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow

1724
02:45:28,719 --> 02:45:31,409
for Trine. Star and I are

1725
02:45:31,409 --> 02:45:33,590
going to play Trine.

1726
02:45:33,590 --> 02:45:37,170
We're going to do the three Triners. Expect

1727
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:39,170
tomorrow to be more of just a chill out

1728
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:42,690
stream. I would imagine.

1729
02:45:42,690 --> 02:45:46,709
We're just going to play Trine. The new one.

1730
02:45:46,709 --> 02:45:49,969
Take care guys. See you soon. See you tomorrow.

1731
02:45:49,969 --> 02:45:53,920
Have a great rest of your night.

1732
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:56,360
And that is where we end

1733
02:45:56,360 --> 02:46:04,399
this stream. Goodnight guys.
