1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:09,529
He goes, hey, what's up? How are you? Good to see you.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,050
How's everybody doing? I don't know what you're doing. All right.

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:21,079
Just sending out a tweet. Sorry, I'm late. Yeah, whatever. You know what? I'm not even gonna say

4
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:29,260
that anymore. I'm not even gonna say that anymore. Do I? Okay. If you're late every day, are you late?

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,100
Are you just a piece of shit?

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,439
Oh, sorry, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late today. Hey, sorry,

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm late today. Hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late today. At what point you're not late?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:01,579
You're just a dick. I'm not a dick though. For God's sake, what? No, I'd rather look, I'm gonna take

9
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:13,290
the incredible wisdom of Nintendo. Somebody at Nintendo once said, I would delay the fucking

10
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,730
game three more times if I knew it was going to be a better video game when it released,

11
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,019
when kids got their hands on it, right? Somebody said that at Nintendo. What's going on? Why is

12
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:42,310
my voice like this? Why? Whatever. I would rather be live when I'm ready than turn the stream on,

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:50,540
not be ready, have a little bit of a headache, sit there and go, oh, oh, my head. And everyone's

14
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,069
like, oh, his head. And I'm like, oh, ow, ow, ow. For like 30 minutes. No, I'm gonna stream when

15
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:11,750
I'm ready. And you know what I noticed? Since streaming, since going back to, when I say back,

16
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,110
I mean, since going down to like two days a week, obviously Elden Ring was a lot different,

17
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,310
right? Because I was streaming that a lot more. But since doing two to three days a week, like one

18
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,870
to two days a week sometimes, right? I feel like I haven't seen you guys in a while. So I just

19
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,349
absolutely unload on you with just weird stuff that I've like thought of in the last like five

20
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:43,800
days. I think that's why the streams have gotten odder in the last like year. Because there's way

21
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,759
more stuff for me to say to you. And there was, you know, if I were to stream every single day,

22
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,879
I wouldn't have had that Dunkin Donuts drive through scenario, right? Maybe I would have,

23
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:03,639
but it wouldn't have been as in the front of the head. Because you lost your mind. No, I'm just

24
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,680
messing around. You guys know that. Hi, how are you? Welcome to the stream. Today we're gonna play

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:15,050
Elden Ring. Not regular Elden Ring. We're gonna do multiplayer. I'm gonna start, we're gonna do

26
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:23,340
some invasions. We're gonna pick a spot somewhere. I'm gonna put a sign down. Or you'll put a sign

27
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,409
down and then we'll have a group password. We'll do some PvP. Maybe we'll do some summoning. If

28
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:36,150
you're having trouble with the boss. Hey, maybe I might help you kill Godric. That's very possible.

29
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:45,590
What system? This is on PC. I'm not going to tell you anything yet because I don't want...

30
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,569
Okay, here's why I don't want to tell everybody what the information is. I think I'd rather just

31
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:59,210
slowly trickle in because I don't want like 5,000 people to all put their sign down right now

32
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:12,219
in the same spot. So just hold on. You have multiple characters for certain levels. No,

33
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:18,459
unfortunately I have one character that's 153 and then me strong who is level 10.

34
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:28,790
So I'm gonna be playing with this character. Just use a password. Levels don't matter.

35
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:42,500
Well, here's the thing. I'm not gonna do like just PvP only. I want to do like some invasions

36
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:54,980
and stuff. But that's the plan. We're just gonna play. We're just gonna hang out. Tomorrow,

37
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:04,170
I'll be live tomorrow. We're not playing Elden Ring. Tomorrow we're gonna do DOS games. I'm gonna

38
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:17,050
grab a bunch of random stuff. Play for a few hours. That's tomorrow. This is today. If anybody has

39
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,129
any recommendations for DOS games, please put them in the recommendation channel in the Discord.

40
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:31,930
Uh, we've played a lot already. Bringing this back. I used to do this. I've done this probably

41
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,860
like five to ten times. Maybe total. So we have done a lot already. It's gonna be really hard

42
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,740
for me to remember what those are. So we're gonna... I will collectively have a pretty decent list

43
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,879
tomorrow. But I might pop in to the Discord and ask a few questions. All right, let me just tweet.

44
00:05:53,879 --> 00:07:03,660
I'll be right back. We'll get started. It just took me so long to do that. Yeah, I'll get around

45
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:12,550
to the BTTV emotes. I know. Oh yeah, I'll get around to that. Oh, yeah. You know what? I've

46
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:21,100
been kind of... Oh yeah, no, I'll get around to it. Yeah, me strong will take care of that.

47
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:28,790
All right, let's go. It took me so long to tweet that. Why? Why did that take so long?

48
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:35,350
That should have been so quick. I just had to look at the keyboard. I actually, honest to God,

49
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,850
I'm not kidding. I just said, all right guys, I'm gonna go tweet. I'll be right back. Let's tweet.

50
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:54,250
I went like this. I was just looking at my keyboard. What the fuck happened? I was just

51
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,610
looking. I was just like, oh, that's... I'm gonna look at the keyboard for like 10 to 15 straight

52
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:07,480
seconds. All right. Hi. Welcome to another stream. Today, I'm gonna be summoning people in PvP.

53
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,319
This is not where I'm doing this, by the way. I'm not doing it here. I know that I'm gonna look down

54
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:19,000
and it's gonna be like... I'm not... Don't. Stop. I'm not doing it here. See? There's already one

55
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,379
right there. I'm not gonna use the katana. Maybe I will. I don't know. You guys see? Okay. How many

56
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,379
rivers of bloods are we gonna see in the first 30 minutes? I didn't even tell you what we were

57
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:37,750
doing yet. Here's what I'm doing. I want to start because... Let me get the hang of this first. Let

58
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:45,960
me like figure out how this works. I'm gonna do some invasions. I'm gonna try to invade somebody's

59
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:57,700
game. Where should I do this? Rest till night at this bonfire. Is there a place that I should do

60
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:12,009
this? I feel like I want to do it somewhere weird. Go to the mountaintops. Why rest till nightfall

61
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:26,200
here? Is there where I get invaded? At the divine bridge? This is like a perfect knot. Rest again.

62
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:34,419
Rest again and walk to the shack. Hold on. I love how I'm still... I like beat the game and I kind

63
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,820
of finished the actual kind of campaign of the game. I love how people are like, all right dude,

64
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,220
rest at that bonfire. Wake up. Take 10 steps forward. Take 10 steps backward. Look at the

65
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,940
ground. Look at the sky. Swing once and a boss appears. I don't... What's he... What am I even

66
00:09:47,940 --> 00:10:08,309
doing? I'm supposed to be invading? Okay, now walk to the shack. Bell Bearing Hunter. What happened

67
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:16,360
to this weapon? Oh, this is fucking hard. Dude, it's so cool. They added like a boss bar for PvP

68
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,080
encounters. That's so cool. That's awesome. I'd say they should have added that a long time ago.

69
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:32,330
That's a cool move. Where'd you get this weapon? Also something finally added. Thank God. It's

70
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:41,740
being able to scale your player model and stuff. Like, bigger head, bigger arms. Nice. Okay, they

71
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:51,019
can kill the NPCs in a bit. I don't even have two headphones in. This doesn't count.

72
00:10:52,059 --> 00:11:01,929
Oh, now I'm not supposed to drink. I know. Whatever. All right, stop with the fucking

73
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:23,379
PvP joke. Just kill this boss. This guy's easy. Get in! Stop respawning. Oh my God. All right,

74
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:33,289
this is not supposed to be a game where I play Elden Ring. I'm supposed to be PvPing. I'm stuck

75
00:11:33,289 --> 00:12:15,399
in the tree. Thank you. Yeah! How come you look like you're 17? Because I moisturize every day.

76
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:26,379
I'm gonna have youthful skin for the rest of my life. Like, internet just freeze. What was that?

77
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:48,820
That was weird. All right, I'll kill this guy. I'll kill this guy. This isn't Fortnite. Okay,

78
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,500
come on. Now I know what's happening. Wait, is he gone? Why is he not here?

79
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,919
Okay. All right, I'm not playing Elden Ring anymore. I'm playing Elden Ring PvP. They're

80
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,519
two separate clients. Two separate EXE files. I shouldn't even be seeing these enemies. It's

81
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:11,340
ridiculous. Okay, so here's where I'm gonna go. Beat him first. Fine. All right, I'll beat him.

82
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:56,070
I got it. I got it. I beat him. I was here for like four hours. I was here for like four hours.

83
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,000
Medicine peddler's bell bearing. All right, cool. I beat it. There we go. All right,

84
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm not gonna use the moon veil in PvP. I'm not gonna do the thing that everybody thinks I'm gonna

85
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:14,169
do. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna use the baby rattle. It's gonna be people are not used to

86
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:21,509
fighting the baby rattle. All right, so let's go. Are you ready? I'm gonna I'm just gonna invade

87
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:32,149
somebody. Just right here. Can I invade somebody here? I just want to see how this works. That's

88
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:59,659
a summon set. Now here we go. Attempts invasion of other players world. Yeah. Phantom bloody finger.

89
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:21,340
Okay, now what? All right, I gotta kill this person. How come they're not on the minimap?

90
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:34,519
Where are they? This be anywhere? Oh, they are in the mini. They are on the minimap.

91
00:15:34,519 --> 00:16:04,179
No, they're not. Wait, what? Do you see me? This guy afk. Let's get the shit out of this guy. Oh,

92
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:13,350
fuck. I scared him. I scared the shit out of him. Never seen a baby rattling PvP. Have you?

93
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:34,490
Fine. I'll do it too. Two sorcerers back to back. He's being a weirdo. He's being a weirdo. He's

94
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:50,059
being a weirdo. Wait, who's? Wait, there's a is that a go to guy? Why? Who is this?

95
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:28,220
Oops. What's happening? Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Is healing illegal? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh,

96
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:46,900
he just baseball swung me to midair. How come I don't get a tag team partner? Oh, I got him.

97
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:58,740
Now what? Now what? Now what do we do? Do I have to fight him too? Whoa, I did it. I kind of feel

98
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,079
bad though. That like, that's annoying. I kind of feel bad. Like that person was just afk. Like

99
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:21,940
hanging out. The person probably, what did they lose their souls? They do. I feel, I feel kind of

100
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:31,769
bad. That was fun though. I don't know why that was fun. They're five feet from the grace and

101
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:36,730
it's fine. That's true. Oh, so what I can do that anywhere. I've never done PvP in any of the souls

102
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:47,190
games ever. So I can just do that anywhere in the whole world. What's a weird place that no one would

103
00:18:47,750 --> 00:19:05,640
ever invade you at like a front door LB on the map. What is this? What is this?

104
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:27,450
Multiplayer status. This is where people are hot spots. Oh, for Dan swamp. That is kind of a weird

105
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,400
place. Or what about the, I mean, the front door actually has a lot of, uh, activity. What about

106
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:43,099
like over here? Like in right in front of the divine tower of limb grip fight them on the elevator.

107
00:19:43,099 --> 00:20:03,019
Here we go. Oh, I can't use it here. The guy was an afk. He was waiting for me. He was hot spots.

108
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,359
Why? I repeat. Well, well, that was kind of fun. I'll do it again. How about just over here? Whatever

109
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:18,789
right here. Doesn't work in all areas. Okay. He used the taunter's tongue. Lunaria is full of

110
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:26,569
tryhards. So is this sectioned off to kind of like skill level? Lunaria is for the tryhards.

111
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,150
Limgrave is for the people that don't even understand the mechanic is in the game.

112
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:36,539
Kaylet is for people that want the like kind of animated background, like in street fighter.

113
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:42,759
The capital are for people that said, look how far I've come in the game so far. And like, I'm like,

114
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,319
look, I'm at the capital. I played the game for a while and the mountains is nobody cares because

115
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:54,279
nobody plays. Nobody wants to be here. Right. I look at how far I made it into the game.

116
00:20:54,839 --> 00:21:01,670
It's based on your level. Oh, Oh, let's just do it right here. Whatever. I have like, I got a shit

117
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:14,650
load of these. Let's go festering bloody finger. Let's use it. Invasions are one V two.

118
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:29,420
Did it work? I didn't even look. Did I teleport? Cancel. Oh, it's not doing it.

119
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:41,819
You can only evade people who are in co-op. You can one V one viewers by making a password for us

120
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:49,609
and put them down the duelist sign. Like what's going on here? Well, go do something so I can

121
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:55,049
invade you. Oh, there's nobody around there. Okay. There is somebody around there right there.

122
00:21:55,769 --> 00:22:05,259
No one is here. God damn it. All right. How about like, how about like the cat? Yeah. People will

123
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:13,029
be like right here. Right? Yeah. Get a fight club going. I just turned. I just started.

124
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:16,789
Relax. I don't, I'm not going to start the fight club before I even know how to

125
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:29,619
PVP everybody. This is a good place. Uh, Ray Lucario game is good for PVP.

126
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:57,299
Let me do it. I want to do some more invasions. People play this game. The Hallux. Oh, oh, oh,

127
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:11,529
oh, oh, oh, it's a dead game. All right. Here we go. I should dress like a weirdo, right?

128
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:48,599
All right. Make them think I'm fucking lagging. What was that move?

129
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,720
Starlight. Oh, that was a bad idea. I was going to do this. Freak them out.

130
00:23:52,279 --> 00:24:05,049
What the fuck just happened to me? Oh, what? That tracks. How much does that track? Oh my God.

131
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:28,440
I'm going to get embarrassed. I got him. Nice job. GG. What happened? So I should, I should dress up

132
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:39,400
as the baby then. I would be furious right now. That person had 15 bigger.

133
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:53,819
Okay. Why did I, why did that, why did they die? I hit them with the swing for the baby rattle.

134
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,380
That hits. Then the explosion hits. And then like a second later, he would hurt them.

135
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:06,789
That was weird. All right. Cool. I actually kind of like this. It's fun.

136
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:16,380
You played the entire game without following up an L2. Um, maybe rattle does not have an L2 follow

137
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:24,140
up. Everybody scream. No L2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No R2 follow up.

138
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:38,009
Look, no R2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No R2 follow up. No L2 follow up. And by the way,

139
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:42,089
the person that said that you have to understand, I played the first like 50 hours of this game

140
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:50,279
without the flask of wondrous physique. I mean, there's that I'm, I have a tendency.

141
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:56,059
How much is like right in front of the ear tree? Kind of fun. Like at the throne. Yeah.

142
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:12,420
Let's do it right here. And let me change my outfit because who cares about actually winning games.

143
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,559
Let's make ourselves just look like scary and weird and creepy.

144
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:47,319
Yeah. I'm going to be an assassin. Hmm. There we go. Big oven mitts and mushroom legs.

145
00:26:48,039 --> 00:27:01,480
Oh, that's ugly. There you go. I just put on like a boxing glove and go punch people.

146
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:15,289
I just want to walk around with two shields. That'd be fun. All right. Uh, where's the katana?

147
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:25,240
I just want it in one hand and I want a parrying dagger in the left hand. I want people to think

148
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,819
like, Oh, God damn it. Do I really have to fight against this fucking, this guy's just going to

149
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:44,410
try hard the whole time. Where's, uh, where is it? Here you go. Even if it doesn't work, I don't,

150
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:50,140
it doesn't need to work. It just needs to look like I'm trying to do that. Yeah. Like right here.

151
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,839
Yeah. I want people to be like, Oh, come on, man. Really? I'm going to start like this.

152
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,069
They'll think you're trying to use moon bill. All right. Here we go.

153
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:11,480
You can't do it here. You can't do it on the throne. Huh? What about just like here means bed

154
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:21,720
chamber. What I want to, whoever I invade right now as the, I'm the moon veil, try hard guy.

155
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,019
I want to make, here's what, here's the ultimate. We're going to make somebody's day

156
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,359
because I'm going to come in there and I'm going to make sure that I lose.

157
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,539
So that person fucking jumps up in their chair and they're like, yes, like new piece of shit.

158
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:53,460
See, like I beat you. I want to make sure that they think that. So let's do it. I've even,

159
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:06,390
how long have you been drinking matcha for? Um, not that long. Don't pander to the three V ones.

160
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:17,980
Wait, there's a, what started fighting the boss? Oh, that's unfortunate. That's so funny.

161
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,940
Get me in there. I'm going to hopefully find somebody that's about to go in the boss door.

162
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:35,779
I want to stand in front of the boss door. That was a waste of a finger.

163
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:57,940
That should return it to you. That's not fair. And I got a bow too, right? Oh, moon veil. Oh God.

164
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:30,859
Oh, here we go. A bit of menacing. I am. They're talking. They're in a discord call right now

165
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:38,660
going like, man, I, people, people just net decking. Yeah. Nice net deck kid.

166
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,779
That's what they both are saying right now. All right. This time I'm actually going to try it.

167
00:30:43,779 --> 00:31:00,660
I'm going to make somebody angry. No, they're saying what the fuck was that? I'm going to

168
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:18,730
actually try this one. I'm going to, I'm going to be the moon veil guy was going to the boss door.

169
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:35,849
Damn it. Shit. I wanted to backstab them so bad. I will go off and backstab somebody at this box.

170
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:38,730
I'm wasting fingers. Whatever. I can buy them from merchants. Who cares?

171
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,599
Invade away from the boss. I want to go up there and I want to, I want to scare the shit out of

172
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:49,640
somebody. Why would you ever get invaded here? Right? Like dude, there's no, like what a shitty

173
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:58,490
place to fight. First of all, people are just walking into this boss door. The recusant finger

174
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,849
is infinite. Okay. I got to get up there quick. They're going in. They're going to go, go, go,

175
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:17,430
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Quickly. All right. Do I have any? There's

176
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:25,779
anything what's really long range a bow and arrow. Right? Could I like shoot him with a bow? Like

177
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:44,250
should I turn instantly and shoot the bow just like a bow? No. Use a great bow. Can I even hold

178
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:54,470
a great bow? I'm an Azure with a common I common. As they're my take too long. Use the red as a bow

179
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:01,740
And I does that go actually go that far? How annoying is that? I don't okay

180
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,700
I don't also don't want to be annoying the whole time. I want to see if this works

181
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,990
Invasions are always annoying

182
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:37,000
Invading is inherently annoying. Am I being annoying? You don't have a staff equipped. Oh god damn it

183
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:07,789
That would be so scary, I don't think anyone expects it and you know, somebody invaded

184
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:09,590
Oh, I wonder they're probably far away

185
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,030
I'm just at the bottom of the stairs put the fucking staff on dude. What a waste of

186
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:21,260
If this works, this is so stupid. I hate this. Okay, here we go

187
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,139
So just use the other finger. Is there any

188
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,690
Benefit to using this one that I had because I have them

189
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:33,679
Is there any reason to ever use these ever is it the exact same thing?

190
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:43,190
Use the taunter's tongue. I'm currently invading the exact same. Okay, see if I can do it

191
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,989
I

192
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:33,289
Am I up here? Is that the person? Oh shit. I got moved. Oh shit

193
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:45,590
Let's work. What's that? Why did he fall down?

194
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:55,989
Stop oh my goodness

195
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,139
No, I'm trying to kill him in one hit

196
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:19,519
What that was such a good fight? What the fuck? That was such a great fight. What happened? It didn't rage quit

197
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:56,460
Okay, I kind of like that. Let's go

198
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,820
Like what kind of stat combination is this?

199
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:21,760
Also, I want this person to be like, I don't know what the fuck's going on this guy

200
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:35,059
But I'm gonna like just pretend like I'm gonna walk around like my connection is bad. Wait, they're not here yet

201
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:55,429
shit

202
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:59,809
You can jump over the railing I think you can jump over the railing

203
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:12,199
You can jump over that railing. Oh, you know how I know that because I've seen speedrunners that do that

204
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,500
I just not whatever

205
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:27,519
Imagine somebody getting in there. He's invade someone else. I'm not invading the same person

206
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:37,539
Hotkey my beloved Omega. Well, he thinks he can God free skip

207
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:46,150
Nobody thought I could I will skip and I didn't two tries and I just want to so badly just be the boss

208
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,150
I want to be standing there when they get there

209
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:55,340
All right. I'll go in somewhere else. I'm going somewhere else. Fine. God damn it. All right, where's the where's the uh,

210
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:08,460
Activity, why is there a lot of activity inside of these dungeons? That's kind of weird the top like the mountaintop

211
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,809
Do the main gate at Ray Lucario?

212
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:30,079
Let's just try here. Whatever. I'm having fun doing invasions. Oh fire mazula. That's right

213
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:42,949
You should skip 48 minutes of waters. Why I'm invading I'm having fun getting invaded in the dungeons actually pretty cool

214
00:40:43,469 --> 00:41:25,420
All right. Where are you? Can I get on horse here? See me? Oh, yeah, let's get this shit out of somebody

215
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,110
What

216
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:44,980
Why did mine go into the ground what the fuck is happening with these people get away from me

217
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,440
shit

218
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,110
Why?

219
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,469
Why did my beam go?

220
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:10,820
Two inches in front of me and do nothing. I did the beam and it went this far. What happened?

221
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:24,880
I want it. I want to kill up against those people again. You aimed it at the ground

222
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,500
I was targeting somebody you hit the rock in front of you. I didn't know that there was a madness beam

223
00:42:32,059 --> 00:43:11,179
See them right there like I don't see him. What the fuck is he doing?

224
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:29,869
Hope you have fucked now

225
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:40,809
Stayed next to this thing. This is so unfair

226
00:43:41,329 --> 00:44:13,619
Am I hitting him shit? Is it my just cheap? Oh, he killed it. Fuck. Oh my god. I didn't get okay

227
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:22,820
I honestly didn't think he killed it. I was I don't know what I was doing. I don't understand what happened

228
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,699
I I was like, I didn't think he was gonna kill that thing

229
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,340
But then I forgot that like other players probably don't think that the hand is that big of a deal

230
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:37,659
I was like just watching him fight it. All right, no more messing around like I'm not gonna like Oh cutesy

231
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:43,760
Look, I'm not gonna attack you. I'm gonna pretend like I have a connection problem. Oh, I have an idea

232
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,130
Let me invade somebody and pretend I have a connection problem and then they kill me great fucking fantastic. I'm killing this person

233
00:44:50,369 --> 00:45:43,429
Here we go. I'm running another cooperator. Where are they? I'm not since in any movement. I'm gonna get sniped use the compass

234
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,510
Oh

235
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:55,920
Right. I forgot that exists. He's just sitting at a fire

236
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:24,530
Where are they at them a person tried to summon a friend it didn't work. That's not them. Is that them?

237
00:46:24,809 --> 00:46:59,619
No, there's inside the building it below you. How do I get over there? Oh, that's unfortunate

238
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:11,860
You'd reinvade with finger. I'll try this one more time. I'm gonna go somewhere else. I actually think this is really fun

239
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:22,250
No, I love this at a password. We will we will I just want to invade. Well, actually

240
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:32,900
Does the password do invasions thought that was just for what was that? The password doesn't work for

241
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:51,650
Invasions does it? Okay down here. Is this the same thing? Are they underneath me like all the way?

242
00:47:52,250 --> 00:48:02,690
Are they actually here? Why does it keep putting me up there? Yeah, what?

243
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,010
No, I promise we will do I will you guys can put your signs down and I'll bring you in

244
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,110
Alright, and well, I want to some cooperative stuff, too. I want to like have people summon me to help fight

245
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:19,539
Godric. All right. I must be spawning above them, right? So use another finger

246
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,079
Use another one and then it'll redo it jump it down

247
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:53,409
I'm gonna I'll die. That's them right there. Oh shit

248
00:48:53,929 --> 00:48:55,929
Move the person this guy's gonna die

249
00:48:56,329 --> 00:49:10,489
But he doesn't know where I am though, right? This person's not paying attention

250
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:19,380
No, I don't want to shoot you want to shoot your friend friends. Not even fucking here. Let's go

251
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:51,739
Get in there overwhelm them. Yeah, this guy even here. This guy do it

252
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,260
Is he still alive?

253
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:59,900
All right. Well, you've got no friends no more

254
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:09,380
What's that person doing? This guy's probably pissed. What the fuck is happening?

255
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:25,780
What is it? Is there was there another there's another person here. I'm so confused. We're gonna kill this guy. Come on

256
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:36,989
Yo, yo

257
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:38,190
damn it

258
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:59,969
God, who is that? I can't tell these people apart

259
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:34,139
Who's this guy what happened I have I have no idea what's just going on what was just going on

260
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:43,340
Another invader invaded you that was his compound invasions

261
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:49,920
So you tell me that guy I?

262
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,280
Invaded a player that player

263
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:01,210
Asked two other players for help. I killed one of those helpers as an afk

264
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:08,099
One of those helpers invaded that game and killed everybody in one swing

265
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:13,460
That invader was your teammate. Why was I dead? Well, he killed me in one hit

266
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,960
Invaded the host you got a helper but friendly fire is on. So did we win?

267
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,179
Did we did we beat it?

268
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:36,420
That's so funny. That was mayhem. I couldn't even tell you what was going on if I wanted to

269
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:47,679
That guy came in and just waved a magic wand and killed everybody. What the hell was that?

270
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,099
Like I was a referee. That wasn't even a player. He just came in and like he blew a whistle. We all stopped

271
00:52:53,699 --> 00:53:25,440
Oh, you told me to get that up. Oh

272
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,780
shit

273
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:55,579
Thanos snapped doesn't Thanos have like a big hammer

274
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:08,760
Thanos has a big hammer, doesn't he? No, he's got the twin blades. He's got the glaive. Yeah. Yeah, you didn't have a

275
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:29,400
Spike that's not an accurate cosplay and also doesn't have a tabard. That was so funny, though. I almost beat him

276
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:44,449
You know what? I want to do so bad. I just want to freak somebody out like crazy

277
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,949
I want to just jump from here and land in front of them and die

278
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:51,230
Maybe like where did they come from? Why did they just fall? Are they all right?

279
00:54:51,829 --> 00:55:13,480
They right there. Is that them sitting right there? That's a fault. I mean, I'm gonna try. I don't know. That's a marionette

280
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,300
They're at the bonfire

281
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:27,210
Damn it. Oh, well, you know I'm saying I just want that person to be walking around and a red invader just falls into

282
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,210
Like in their field of view in front of them and dies

283
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:44,519
With the fingers and your hot bar. Yeah, I will. Okay same deal. They're probably all the way over here

284
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:52,039
It's the same guy you don't know that I mean it could be because I don't know how many people are currently in Mount

285
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:55,360
Gelmira in the US matchmaking right now, who knows

286
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:11,619
Last guy was here. We're here

287
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:39,679
Person hiding that they were over here. I don't see any movement use the finger again. I didn't mean to do that

288
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:48,099
They see it though

289
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:51,059
I'm gonna be careful. I'm gonna end up in like an Elden Ring

290
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:53,619
funny moments compilation I

291
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:07,260
Was to go somewhere else how about like here let's look at some hotspots people fight here a lot

292
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,840
All right. What about over here? This is where the try-hards are, right? Okay

293
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:31,000
Use the invisible crouch talisman. Do I have it seals wear while crouching? Oh

294
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,900
Shit, I actually do have it. Okay. All right, let's go

295
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:50,059
I'm gonna have to turn crouch on because I'm not pressing X every time. All right, let's do it. So I'm invisible

296
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:58,179
You say so when I crouch when I get in the game, I'm not I'm invisible to the people on the other team

297
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:12,420
Has been only when you move away. You have to be in a distance. Do I have to stand completely still?

298
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:33,809
What can I move you can move this person doesn't see me how this is look at these Christmas lights. What is this?

299
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:41,800
How close is too close?

300
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:54,219
Can you see me now? Oh

301
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,980
Okay, I've already scared him. I would do a bow

302
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:21,480
Let's go

303
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:42,559
Got dabbed on I

304
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:49,250
Had it too. I I'm doing it again. It's the lag. It's the lag

305
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:53,289
I swung and it like went through his body and then like a second later. It's like, oh

306
00:59:54,210 --> 01:00:11,050
But it was a glancing blow apparently. It was a glancing blow apparently this thing is okay

307
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:26,780
So I'm gonna I'm gonna just try to it's BM though, isn't it? And that BM kind of I just invaded

308
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:32,909
Ranny the witch's game my god, I mean I'm gonna be trouble

309
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:45,320
All right. They're trying to do something weird, which is I think they're trying to go on top of the house

310
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:56,940
I'm invisible. They don't know where I am. They're trying to do something weird. Okay, here we go

311
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:20,840
I got another wait. I have a friend. Hey, all right, so this is a friend. It's time for some fucking classic PvP

312
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,840
No, you're a friend. All right, let's go. All right. I don't know if you're watching the streaming up

313
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,480
I mean, I'm not gonna assume that but I'll I'll take

Zealot you got it. All right, let's go

316
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,260
Make sure you bow first

317
01:01:39,260 --> 01:02:05,000
Really a bit recess from software PvP is recess. I'm not gonna

318
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:56,260
Yeah, what why didn't I didn't get a backstab? Why not gonna expect that for me? Are you packed into it? Hey, what happened?

319
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:07,099
I didn't start that by the way. I just finished it. We did it

320
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:19,179
All the host was the okay. I see I didn't do that that guy

321
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,719
Shot a bunch of mold out of his hands and I didn't have anything to do with that

322
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:43,519
What level am I 153? I'm gonna do it again. Where's the pouch? Yeah, let's do this. I'm gonna

323
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,280
Just break a bunch of remembrances in there. What can I do? That's just weird put the soap on somewhere

324
01:03:49,280 --> 01:04:06,739
Just do clean myself. I put this on all these this is gonna be weird. Nobody does that

325
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,500
I'll do like another okay. I'm gonna do like maybe

326
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:18,500
I have a five or six more and then we'll do some we'll do some PvP

327
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:32,760
What does that was put you can put your signs down use the mimic veil. Are you still red? You're still red, right?

328
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:59,860
There they are did I just go invisible on their screen? Oh my god, I was bowing

329
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:40,630
This guy's like do you have any other moves

330
01:05:40,869 --> 01:06:11,849
Oh

331
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:28,639
Fight good fight. Those are some really cool moves. What the hell were those go to the main Academy Gate?

332
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:44,000
I will try that now. Okay main Academy Gate. Oh, those are faith spells. They've those are cool. Let's seem fun

333
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:52,050
dragon and crucible faith moves

334
01:06:52,050 --> 01:07:04,019
So, okay. I see why this is a PvP zone. It's just a circle. I want some new clothes, too

335
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,360
As I'm not I don't need to do the comedy thing anymore

336
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:24,250
What do I actually want to put on I guess I put on the hat I look like a dickhead though, all right

337
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:44,170
Um, I'm still medium with these big pants on this place is for duels not invasions

338
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:47,550
Who's to say that?

339
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:57,739
I'm doing it right now. Is the mimic the mimic fail actually works

340
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:21,220
Put it on it works. How is that nobody to invade here? Oh, there we go

341
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:27,460
Use the red sign on the ground I will it's cross region enabled. It is not

342
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:32,670
I'm sorry to all the people that are not in the United States

343
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:38,750
But I'm not going to get swung at dodge and then two and a half seconds later take damage for it

344
01:08:39,069 --> 01:09:01,760
It's just not happening. All right. Well, well, come on. I'm a hundred and fifty three. All right, here we go

345
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:04,609
If you want to put a sign down, I'll put mine

346
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:16,779
The multiplayer password is cheese doctor. It's like that. I'm gonna put this

347
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:29,470
I guess I'm just gonna have to pull people in it's probably easier for me to pull signs in right?

348
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:40,829
Me you can't see it. All right. Well, okay. The password is cheese doctor capital C capital D cheese doctor. No spaces

349
01:09:41,310 --> 01:10:00,159
No period cheese doctor er smooth face cam. All right, my goodness. Well, I just told you what it was

350
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:27,729
Here cheese doctor. See it. All right, here we go. This is trying to invade another world over and over again

351
01:10:28,449 --> 01:10:35,359
The last time I did this in Dark Souls

352
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:40,520
It was insane how many signs are on the ground turn off the invasion use the remedy. Oh

353
01:10:48,810 --> 01:11:02,739
Okay, how do I turn off the invasion? What happened? I finally found somebody to invade

354
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:42,010
Why would this be out here? It's Garfield. I don't think he notices. All right. Well, that was cool

355
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:46,279
No, no, I don't take it off

356
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:53,699
Like that's gonna fix it. How do I take this off? How do I take it off?

357
01:12:38,369 --> 01:13:05,500
Wait, is this too obvious? I can't see I can't see the painting covers it. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit

358
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:40,500
That's so funny. All right. Where are the signs? That's right. Ladies and gentlemen

359
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:46,960
I might invade your game terms and conditions do apply

360
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:56,659
Could you be the lucky viewer that germa 985 invades? This is a weird thing

361
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:03,220
Oh, well some some like some celebrity will do that and they've never played they don't they're just part of the promotion

362
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,180
They just don't give a shit at all. They invade like two people. That's the whole thing

363
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:16,750
That's the big wow. I can't believe it. They play for like eight minutes

364
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:22,750
All right, let's do this one. Oh, no, we're going against the joker

365
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,239
Two huge hammers

366
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:44,270
That's not a viewer. How do you know? I want to invade somebody in like hide. I think that's so fun

367
01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:03,250
You ready? I don't know. I just did what you did. This is weird

368
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:19,329
This looks like a cartoon

369
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:39,020
Whoa

370
01:15:39,020 --> 01:16:06,609
Oh, I had no stamina

371
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:12,300
Didn't think it was gonna be twice in a row

372
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:39,939
Good game good fight. That was cool. Nobody expects twice in a row. Who are you? How about billy bobbertson?

373
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:50,130
That's that sounds fun password password is cheese doctor capital c and then dr

374
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:54,210
Capital d cheese doctor. This is still not a viewer. How do you know that?

375
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:56,289
You don't know that

376
01:16:56,289 --> 01:17:18,899
All right. Let's incorporate some uh, some more sorceries here a dodge always for I didn't mean to do that

377
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:19,939
All right. Here we go

378
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:24,189
You can always say i'm ready by doing the strafe strafe strafe strafe

379
01:17:24,909 --> 01:17:33,470
Oh, I got it off

380
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:49,500
He's panicking

381
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,060
Oh nice bait. That was good bait. It was

382
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,869
Whoa?

383
01:18:07,869 --> 01:18:14,430
Whoa?

384
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:16,430
Don't waste all your stamina

385
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:27,229
Oh got me signs with circles are viewers. Oh shit

386
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:43,630
Okay, that was good. That's good fight. So that was not somebody watching, okay

387
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:58,189
Really? Yes. There we are. Okay. So this person that's not there's no circle

388
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,779
Oh, are we going to go up up against?

389
01:19:04,579 --> 01:19:13,819
Shpee. Oh, it's the circle on the bottom. I thought it was gonna be up here fine

390
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:27,810
I need some better emotes. See mine. There's like like I these are like default dances in fortnight. Get them off

391
01:19:28,210 --> 01:20:12,510
Oh, it looks like I was mocking. All right. Here we go. Ready. I'm ready. Hey

392
01:20:14,029 --> 01:20:16,029
That's excuse me

393
01:20:16,109 --> 01:20:18,510
Excuse me. He's drinking flask. Where's referee?

394
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:37,100
No, I fucking don't this is all the rules wrong. I'm drinking i'm gonna drink i'm not gonna let that happen

395
01:20:37,739 --> 01:21:35,220
If you get one I get one good fight. Yeah, I ran forward

396
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:50,939
Immediate pivot that was a good fight. That's the soul level 153. This is really fun

397
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:58,909
But this is really fun. I understand why people do this now. All right, I need the ones with the circles

398
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:09,600
Here we go right here. Zoram. We're uh, we'll go zoram first

399
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:14,159
Yeah, okay, how about peeing myself that sounds that's good i'm that might not even been a viewer

400
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:32,449
I don't think that was a viewer. What are the emotes I have?

401
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:37,170
Let's do this while they're before they hear her

402
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:57,119
All right. What do you got? What are you wearing? I don't see any weapons mistake right now. He's like, oh shit

403
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:00,460

404
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:04,060
Uh dash the forward dodge is just oh my god. I'm ready. I gotta be ready

405
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:12,560
Okay, let's do it

408
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,689
What

409
01:23:32,689 --> 01:23:34,689
Is happening with this person?

410
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:39,550
I'm so confused

411
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,069
Wait, what's going on? What the fuck is going on?

412
01:23:51,579 --> 01:23:53,579

Oh, he's peeing. Okay

414
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:05,020
He also drank flask too, which uh

415
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:09,020
We all know that's uh, not allowed

416
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:19,649
And he liked he was like teleporting. That was weird. All right. Yeah, I do a password

417
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:25,460
All right. Password is cheese doctor. You can't see it, but i'll move passwords cheese doctor cheese doctor

418
01:24:30,449 --> 01:24:35,680
Touch chugged flask before a fight. Is that cheating? What should I do for a flask?

419
01:24:57,810 --> 01:24:59,789
for you

420
01:24:59,789 --> 01:25:01,789

01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:29,100
Wait, actually tell me the truth is using the wondrous physique flask

423
01:25:30,539 --> 01:25:36,989
Em in pvp or no, is that fine? No, okay

424
01:25:37,390 --> 01:26:01,010
I don't know where this person is but they're not here. I think this is fucked up. What about over here?

425
01:26:01,329 --> 01:26:05,630
All right. This is

426
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:21,550
Is there xbox that's an xbox username

427
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:26,329
What does this say? No skill ahead all the more dung ahead

428
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:32,239
Try summoning. Oh for the uh ranala

429
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:36,750
How are we?

430
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:53,420
Here we go. What the fuck what happened?

431
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:56,300
That actually worked

432
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:09,289
All right. That was i'm not using that again

433
01:27:12,409 --> 01:27:18,989
Is that was that kind of unfair?

434
01:27:18,989 --> 01:27:22,430
I'm sorry girthquake. That was not fair. That was just stupid

435
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,689
That that's that's so dumb

436
01:27:31,789 --> 01:27:33,149
uh, how about

437
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,590
Hilarious

438
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:46,479
I want to even get one of these off from the beginning like right when it's like let's go. Let's go. Let's go, right?

439
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,020
That works shockingly. Well

440
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,460
Is that fire damage?

441
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:59,819
So technically you could put on a ton of fire resist drink that blow up and then fight them

442
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:07,789
Totally really that's weird. Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. All right. Okay, we're just going you just got here

443
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,060
Hey

444
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,060
Scared the shit out of me. I thought that was

445
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,380
Is the magic bullet doing that?

446
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:41,800
Oh

447
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,520
Wowie

448
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,760
Oh, I wanted to jump but I didn't have enough stamina

449
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:52,989
Nice fight

450
01:28:52,989 --> 01:28:54,989
You're allowed to use a blue flask. You are

451
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:20,939
Well, I can drink blue. Okay, cool. So blue is allowed. Okay, it's fun. Pick me pick me, please

452
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:25,880
warrior

453
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:35,159
Millennia

454
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:39,479
I'm sorry, but there's no respect here at all. This is absolute

455
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm just gonna go go straight up disrespect if this is you playing right now. Just be aware

456
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:51,720
I'm going full on disrespect mode full disrespect. You don't come in and come in here with a millennia cost plan

457
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:18,220
What the hell

458
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,220
Do you want to play that? All right, we'll play that

459
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,960
No, not that stupid thing

460
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:39,149
You gotta be fucking kidding me

461
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:41,710
She has this move where she goes in the air

462
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,069
And she slash slash slash you cannot fucking avoid the

463
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:55,289
Yeah, well, maybe if I didn't drink the take

464
01:30:55,770 --> 01:31:00,729
Uh two-thirds of my health off in the very beginning by drinking the exploding flask and I didn't I didn't time it right

465
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,220
Hold on. Are we certain that the summoning signs are that accurate the circle on the ground?

466
01:31:16,779 --> 01:31:20,729
How actually accurate is that?

467
01:31:20,729 --> 01:31:30,380
Don't growl at me. Okay

468
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:32,380
So you can drink these that's cool. All right

469
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,979
I'm maybe i'm gonna change up my spells too. These are pve spells

470
01:31:36,619 --> 01:31:39,439
I think i'm gonna change that up. I'm gonna put on

471
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,119
Just weird shit that people that people are gonna be like annoyed to have to deal with

472
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:49,609
Pve. Okay. Yeah, like shooting glintstone ice crag. You're gonna no it's not gonna work in pvp

473
01:31:50,409 --> 01:32:21,560
Let's do it

474
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,359
Whoa, you can okay you that you poised through that

475
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,489
Oh fuck

476
01:32:42,489 --> 01:32:46,189
Okay

477
01:32:46,189 --> 01:32:48,189
I you can't he poises through it

478
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:50,680
You poise through it you poise through okay

479
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:56,600
I I for some reason I thought that the magic glintstone ice crag was gonna break that poise

480
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,760
But you just said you cannot become out of that animation

481
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,600
I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know and if I knew you would have lost by the way

482
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:20,220
That's if I knew you would have lost that fight. Okay, this is not gonna work, but maybe this will

483
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,880
Yeah, let's do that

484
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:32,159
That's all right, what about that was weird like freezing mist like who the fuck uses this

485
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:37,479
meteorite something weird

486
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,680
and

487
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,039
What else should I do?

488
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:52,750
crystal release

489
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:56,670
Demo or ice storm. All right, let's just be kind of like an annoying weirdo

490
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:08,039
All right, zoram. Let's go

491
01:34:08,039 --> 01:34:15,039
Crystal burst is good. Oh wait, I don't want to do that

492
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:18,079
That's kind of like bad because it'll start attacking him and I don't want to start attacking him before he

493
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:20,329
That's like kind of unfair

494
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:29,340
All right, here we go. You're missing half of the pvp spells. I don't whatever

495
01:34:29,739 --> 01:34:46,359
These aren't just gonna shoot over there, right?

496
01:34:46,359 --> 01:34:49,819
Get out of the emote

497
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,279
All right, you can

498
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:55,960
You can drink you can drink that wasn't fair. That wasn't fair. You can drink that wasn't fair

499
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,220
Uh, that wasn't fair. You can drink

500
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:09,979
Here we go, right?

501
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:11,979
Freezing mist is weird. Nobody expects it

502
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:41,420
Holy shit

503
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:43,979
I'm alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive

504
01:35:48,279 --> 01:36:03,689
Kill him kill him

505
01:36:03,689 --> 01:36:07,689
That was a 99 99 int play right there

506
01:36:09,529 --> 01:36:16,000
Do I just go put 99 points in int and okay no zero points

507
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,520
Zero points in anything else besides mind and int

508
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:23,039
And just hold down that spell

509
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:27,739
That's so dumb. All right. Maybe I want to play normally a little bit longer

510
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:37,500
Okay trans rights

511
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:45,149
Let's go for it. Get the crystal tier that makes spells cost nothing

512
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:59,840
Oh, I do. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. He's fine. Yeah

513
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,500
Zero cost. Oh, I don't have to do mine. You're right. Okay

514
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:16,460
Here we go. You ready

515
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:19,340
Oh

516
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:27,760
You're not gonna expect this right now

517
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,479
That's the first parry that we have seen all afternoon

518
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:59,479
Flail what you can't parry a flail. That's right. You can't parry a flail

519
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:13,920
It's good for pvp. All right. All right, let's go

520
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:22,779
Poth what's the swear?

521
01:38:25,979 --> 01:38:35,550
Poth hot head. What is it head? You can't your name can't be head

522
01:38:45,850 --> 01:38:52,779
Uh group password is cheese doctor capital c lower case h e e s e

523
01:38:53,659 --> 01:39:00,649
Capital d lower case r and that's it. Why are you like five times bigger than everybody else? Hey, this guy's huge

524
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:10,159
Am I crazy or?

525
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,159
What the hell? Why did it come up before he threw it?

526
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,960
This is a cool character though. Can I be honest?

527
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:28,060
You only have a certain amount of those

528
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:38,319
Holy shit, what?

529
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:40,880
Good game

530
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,909
That's a cool character

531
01:39:44,909 --> 01:39:49,500
Just throwing pots

532
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500
I like that. That's fun

533
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:58,350
That was good. How how do you catch people off guard with that though?

534
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:03,470
Because if you come in if you have the jar, I think that you have that hat that jar on your head, right?

535
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,039
I'm gonna know

536
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:17,279
All right galaxy. Let's go

537
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:24,729
I will do the just put I need okay. Where do I get some of the pvp spells?

538
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:38,720
Use the cannon. It's the ead which qualifies as a square because it's an acronym for e to a dick

539
01:40:44,189 --> 01:40:47,180
really

540
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,420
Eat eat. Oh my god

541
01:40:50,060 --> 01:40:57,710
All right, let's go

542
01:40:57,710 --> 01:41:05,260
That was weird, but I got you you're not gonna fuck with the guy and so far as ice storm. Are you?

543
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:50,140
Telling you nobody expects you to do that two times in a row. Whoa. What was that? He's got knives

544
01:41:50,939 --> 01:41:53,020
Oh, that's right consumables exist

545
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:08,399
That was that was a good that was a good idea throwing daggers

546
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:20,489
Yeah, everybody does the Thanos snap. I should do it too then right? I gotta do the meadow. How come I can't throw these?

547
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:26,090
Because you could really okay, you could freak somebody out, right?

548
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,840
if I

549
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:34,220
Like stew a soap. Hey, what about this weird shit?

550
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:49,600
Gravitational shockwave like who's ready for that? We already saw you

551
01:42:50,859 --> 01:42:52,859
Uh rock strongo, okay

552
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:58,250
Like if you think i'm doing something, but it's like wait, he just did soap

553
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:05,640
You gotta freak the gamers out with soap

554
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:22,220
Level, uh 153 earthquake was the guy that you cheesed. I didn't cheese anybody

555
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,840
How are you? Welcome to the fight?

556
01:43:29,880 --> 01:44:00,399
Let's begin

557
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:02,399
Oh, that's not good

558
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:10,279
Good fight fight caught you right at the little tail end of that

559
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:18,159
That was very close to you. Not getting in the hitbox

560
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:27,850
It would have been lag would have been like cool

561
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:34,880
Okay, but your password and the level on the screen so people don't ask anymore. That's a good idea

562
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:43,760
Let me do that real quick. Okay

563
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,760
password is

564
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:51,869
Okay, and

565
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:54,880
It's all level 153. There we go

566
01:44:55,439 --> 01:45:07,640
We're gonna go

567
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:19,199
All right. That's okay, right?

568
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,899
All right. Oh shit. We're playing. Okay. Here we go

569
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:54,890
What was that?

570
01:45:54,890 --> 01:45:55,850
Oh

571
01:45:55,850 --> 01:46:06,479
Good fight. We both have the exact same idea. Uh platform pc

572
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:46,189
It's done. Well, do you want to put my pc specs in there too? Hold on. That's good. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine

573
01:46:50,680 --> 01:47:00,000
That's fine. Okay, that's fine. Interesting. Okay, you got those horns

574
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,600
I wonder if you're also gonna have the um

575
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:15,119
That move the weird one. It's not aligned with the ruins bar

576
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:21,039
I actually was thinking that somebody was going to be very very upset about that, right property of germa 9-8

577
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:25,659
But yeah, like a watermark

578
01:47:25,659 --> 01:47:30,779
Imagine watermarking you stream like that like I mean huge like across the whole thing

579
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:33,420
I'm gonna do that in a minute. Not right now

580
01:47:35,050 --> 01:47:36,090
Hello

581
01:47:36,090 --> 01:47:41,529
I want to just bow that's not bow

582
01:47:41,689 --> 01:47:46,000
You got a big sword. All right

583
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:04,270
Oh shit. Oh shit. You do have that thing. Okay

584
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:08,029
Okay

585
01:48:08,029 --> 01:48:10,029
Oh, no one's ever ready for it. But

586
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:28,159
That was the unfortunate triple tap. That was a triple tap. That was unfortunate

587
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:32,960
Okay

588
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:38,010
I like that build the build school

589
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,010
Add using xbox controller

590
01:48:47,369 --> 01:48:51,199
Okay, germa boy

591
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,579
Germa boy

592
01:48:53,579 --> 01:49:00,350
All right. What's the overrunner that this guy walks off of the balcony and dies quick before they come in?

593
01:49:00,909 --> 01:49:24,119
It's pretty high. What are you doing?

594

You can hear us

595
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:32,760

596
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:34,279

01:49:34,279 --> 01:49:35,760

I want to fight the streamer because I want to kick his ass on stream and embarrass him in front of an audience

599
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,159
But also I want to jump off to make the joke happen, right?

600
01:49:47,760 --> 01:50:02,670

I was hoping that I was gonna run and then he was gonna turn and run and I was gonna jump again

616
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:40,939
Again, don't ask for the password anymore. Is that too? Is that too?

Well, I mean there's a lot of germa viewers in this spot right now because we're doing this right now

Is that a katana? What is that moon veil? I'm not sure

624
01:53:37,130 --> 01:53:38,720
Let's go

625
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:45,850

628
01:54:01,079 --> 01:54:02,920

Oh

632
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:24,189
Okay

633
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:26,189
You know what the best part about that was?

634
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:28,270
After it happened

635
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:31,720
He stood completely fucking still like this

636
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,909
No moving no taunting just still

637
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,909
Completely still

638
01:54:38,909 --> 01:54:42,760
You would think that oh you'd come up and like point at the ground and be like hey

639
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:46,350
No, he was over here

640
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:48,779
He was just doing this

641
01:54:48,779 --> 01:54:50,939
It was so menacing and strange

642
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,880
I could see his yeah, I could see him breathing

643
01:54:56,039 --> 01:55:09,159
All right. We already fought you

644
01:55:09,159 --> 01:55:12,039
We already fought germa boy

01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:14,439
All right. All right. Let me let me reload the area

646
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:26,800
Actually, maybe we should go somewhere else any new signs here. I guess we just fight

648
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:33,899

Are ready for this move

655
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:35,640
I don't think people are ready for it. It's just stuff something. Did they just not you just don't see it that often

656
01:56:41,739 --> 01:56:43,739
One more one more. That's a good game. Good game

That was a good fight. I was like if this gets here before I do then i'll win

765
02:17:05,129 --> 02:17:08,409
All right. We gotta we gotta go against giga moth, right?

766
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:14,010
There's no way that I don't fight

767
02:17:14,329 --> 02:17:19,959
How are we looking today?

768
02:17:35,790 --> 02:17:49,920
Mog

769
02:18:15,899 --> 02:18:17,979
Oh that range is not there

770
02:18:20,479 --> 02:18:29,500
Mog

771
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:31,500
We're playing that game. We're playing that game

772
02:18:32,299 --> 02:18:54,090
Why didn't I jump? Is that a stamina? Okay mog

773
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:07,020
It's so funny

774
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:10,219
How if you heal if you drank during a fight?

775
02:19:11,309 --> 02:19:13,950
Like people from the audience is gonna start throwing shit

776
02:19:14,590 --> 02:19:16,829
You know what I mean? Like that if they would be like

777
02:19:17,629 --> 02:19:18,510
Cups

778
02:19:18,510 --> 02:19:23,950
There'd be chairs people like from the stadium like it would be full of like fucking coffee cups and fucking hamburger

779
02:19:24,270 --> 02:19:27,149
Containers and stuff if somebody were to drink to it. No

780
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:34,030
That's the one way to get everybody completely not on your side. Yeah, like popcorn. It would like pizzas

781
02:19:34,590 --> 02:19:37,079
It would be a mess

782
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:43,100
Uh, sure

783
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:46,940
I knew what happened. It happens immediately too. It's like the second that you drink

784
02:19:47,819 --> 02:19:52,219
There's just fucking popcorn containers chairs screaming people booing boo

785
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:56,600
Whoa, you suck

786
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:58,860
It's immediate

787
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:02,459
Now i'm not saying that because like I don't whatever it's for fun

788
02:20:03,180 --> 02:20:12,670
Can you imagine if mog during the boss fight just like

789
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:40,250
That'd be so fuck i'd be funny. What the fuck just happened somebody shoot me from the other side of the map, bro

790
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:51,930
I know that move

791
02:20:51,930 --> 02:21:18,780
Yo, oh

792
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:20,780
Pressure's on pressure's on

793
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:28,190
Dude, are you okay?

794
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:32,600
Did he all that for?

795
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:42,729
What the fuck did it happen? Did you unplug your router and plug it back in?

796
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:55,040
What happened?

797
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,309
That's so funny

798
02:21:57,309 --> 02:21:59,309
Now all of a sudden he just started sliding around

799
02:22:01,149 --> 02:22:03,389
Oh god, that's oh my goodness

800
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:12,700
You see what actually happened there

801
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:18,059
Is you you like you you like unplugged your router and plugged it back in and you pissed off a lot of people

802
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:21,739
And somebody threw a fucking full large soda from the audience

803
02:22:22,459 --> 02:22:26,219
And they hit me in the back of the head and you you I didn't do that

804
02:22:26,299 --> 02:22:28,940
Like somebody fucking hit me in the head with like a fucking box

805
02:22:31,370 --> 02:22:33,370
One more like they hit me

806
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,600
If that was just a coincidence, that's really funny

807
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:56,170
And if I don't care whatever it's funny, uh, one more. That's it. This is why dark souls would ever be in esport

808
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:00,620
How cool would that be though?

809
02:23:00,620 --> 02:23:06,040
uh

810
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:08,010
interesting

811
02:23:08,010 --> 02:23:10,829
I mean, this is the one here. This is this is the best two out of three, right?

812
02:23:11,469 --> 02:23:15,690
This is for the the world series

813
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:19,600
Let me make sure i'm ready

814
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:33,870
This is the worst game for pvp

815
02:23:39,930 --> 02:23:41,930
I think this is really fun

816
02:23:42,889 --> 02:23:44,250
All right. We good

817
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:46,780
That means we're ready

818
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:48,780
Round three. This is for all the marvels here

819
02:23:49,020 --> 02:24:01,899
And i'm waiting for you to do it

820
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:33,069
ready

821
02:24:33,069 --> 02:24:36,809
Good game

822
02:24:36,809 --> 02:24:38,809
That was about to be really close

823
02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:44,760
If you pulled me in

824
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:46,760
like one second earlier

825
02:24:47,770 --> 02:24:58,350
You win good game. All right. How about one more? No, i'm not peeing myself

826
02:24:59,309 --> 02:25:01,500
scam god

827
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:04,219
All right, you have scam in your name. I'm like kind of afraid to summon you

828
02:25:05,530 --> 02:25:07,129
How about beep?

829
02:25:07,129 --> 02:25:33,399
All right, I promise i'm gonna go invade after this it would be actually really cool

830
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:36,120
If from software

831
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:41,399
I know they have like the you collect fingers and phantom fingers, right or whatever. Yeah, there's like they had the covenants before

832
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:46,250
Having an actually ranked system in this game. I think would be really

833
02:25:50,569 --> 02:25:51,770
right

834
02:25:51,770 --> 02:26:15,180
Stat stamina

835
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:21,920
Oh

836
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:23,920
Oh, what a comeback

837
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:25,920
Oh, what a comeback. Damn

838
02:26:26,639 --> 02:26:32,700
That was really that was what a great comeback. I was trying to get too fancy with it

839
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:35,680
I should have just went in and swung. That was yeah, that was

840
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:47,260
No, I didn't throw that was a great comeback. I ran out of stamina. I tried to dodge and I didn't no that's not throw

841
02:26:48,139 --> 02:26:51,739
That was a great come that was great gameplay from the other player

842
02:26:52,540 --> 02:27:11,709
All right, last one no

843
02:27:11,709 --> 02:27:14,840
Yeah, this this person looks interesting

844
02:27:15,870 --> 02:27:17,870
all right joseph

845
02:27:18,270 --> 02:27:37,399
Joseph has a slab of concrete. It's a fingerprint shield resident sleeper. What does that do?

846
02:27:43,159 --> 02:27:54,670
Why is it for it? Okay

847
02:27:55,389 --> 02:28:09,629
What are you doing?

848
02:28:09,629 --> 02:28:14,030
Um, wait, do I do we get to wait till he does all those like warcraft buffs or what can I attack him?

849
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:17,340
I don't okay. I'm just going i'm going in

850
02:28:18,909 --> 02:28:20,860
What are you doing?

851
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:57,239
Joy tag are we ready? Oh this guy's a million poise. Never mind

852
02:28:57,879 --> 02:30:00,969
Shit should have dodged in front of him. Oh

853
02:30:03,319 --> 02:30:10,719
God that was close

854
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:12,079
That was a boss

855
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:14,989
That was a boss for me. That was really hard

856
02:30:15,549 --> 02:30:35,069
That was a redditor. How can you tell when somebody's a redditor? I don't get it. I'm thinking about it

857
02:30:36,459 --> 02:30:40,879
All right

858
02:30:40,879 --> 02:30:43,520
I mean we have to summon the person that's called

859
02:30:44,319 --> 02:30:46,479
Barf drinker, okay, and then that's it

860
02:30:50,299 --> 02:30:54,219
You have a disgusting name you obviously have any outfit that you have on

861
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:56,940
Your name is barf drinker

862
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,079
And then I promise i'm gonna go do invasions. I promise

863
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:02,680
This is the last one

864
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:06,440
If I do another pvp summoning sign thing in this spot

865
02:31:07,079 --> 02:31:09,920
right after this fight

866
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,920
And within five minutes of this one, you know, I don't care about semantics

867
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,760
I'll delete my channel if I do not

868
02:31:15,760 --> 02:31:20,780
You know what I mean? Like if I do another one in a row right now in the next five minutes

869
02:31:21,659 --> 02:31:23,959
All right barf drinker, but what's up?

870
02:31:27,579 --> 02:31:29,579
Oh my i'm gonna get bm'd aren't I?

871
02:31:32,989 --> 02:31:39,159
It's so stupid

872
02:31:39,159 --> 02:31:41,159
He's throwing rocks at me

873
02:31:53,399 --> 02:32:07,920
What the fuck what the hell is happening here?

874
02:32:09,979 --> 02:32:16,600
How did you avoid that?

875
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:18,600
You dick. Oh dick

876
02:32:22,440 --> 02:32:26,459
He wants to poison me and end it your cockiness is gonna be the end here for you

877
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:32,479
His cockiness is gonna get you killed man. I'm telling you this cocky behavior is gonna get you killed. I'm saying it

878
02:32:35,149 --> 02:32:37,309
You want to end it with a fucking oh i'm gonna shoot him with the cannon

879
02:32:38,719 --> 02:32:46,270
No, you're not this person's freaking me out. I don't know what they're gonna do next

880
02:32:55,290 --> 02:33:00,700
Fine

881
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:02,700
I can play that game too. You know

882
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:22,090
I thought I was gonna kill him too. That was crazy

883
02:33:28,079 --> 02:33:30,239
I'm telling you you that would have that was close

884
02:33:32,729 --> 02:33:37,260
All right, i'm leaving

885
02:33:37,260 --> 02:33:38,860
i'm gonna go to

886
02:33:38,860 --> 02:33:44,010
Like up here the halong tree or something like up here

887
02:33:46,569 --> 02:33:48,569
Yeah, like right up here on the roots

888
02:33:48,569 --> 02:33:53,049
What was my record anybody keep track?

889
02:33:53,629 --> 02:33:55,629
What was the uh kd there?

890
02:33:55,709 --> 02:34:18,250
Come on someone someone in the group has become a lord

891
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:23,659
What?

892
02:34:23,659 --> 02:34:27,069
What the hell does that mean?

893
02:34:27,069 --> 02:34:29,549
Does somebody using this password beat the game?

894
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:36,729
That's so funny. Can I not invade anybody on the tree?

895
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:41,959
Somebody just ended the game. That's that's so cute that it does that

896
02:34:50,250 --> 02:34:57,120
Wait and you get a buff too

897
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:00,319
Really? That's pretty cool

898
02:35:00,319 --> 02:35:03,260
All right. Nobody wants to fight here

899
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,799
Oh, they're not people right here. There's so many people. Uh,

900
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:09,040
Soul level coming in here

901
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:12,719
That's impossible

902
02:35:12,719 --> 02:35:23,579
Sometimes it says lord sometimes it says elden lord. It's really weird. Sometimes it says nothing

903
02:35:24,139 --> 02:35:27,200
It's weird. I don't know what the fuck I was just doing

904
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:32,000
I just walked off. I for some reason thought I was in a different zone

905
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,760
I was very strange. I don't know why I just did that

906
02:35:36,319 --> 02:35:40,600
It depends on the ending. Oh, that's cool

907
02:35:41,979 --> 02:35:55,209
All right. Well, i'm gonna that was apparently a bad place to do this. Anyways, this is this probably more people here

908
02:36:03,389 --> 02:36:05,629
Your level is very high. So it might be hard to fight people

909
02:36:07,559 --> 02:36:09,319
Yeah, I mean I am

910
02:36:09,319 --> 02:36:11,879
like end stage final ending

911
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:21,260
I was 150 when I beat the game right 145 maybe all right, let's do it

912
02:36:25,079 --> 02:36:29,739
Where are they at defeat pea break?

913
02:36:30,299 --> 02:36:52,780
What's going on over there? That was really weird. Okay

914
02:36:53,500 --> 02:37:20,510
I hear footsteps. Where are they?

915
02:37:21,879 --> 02:37:27,770
Are they on top?

916
02:37:35,290 --> 02:37:46,430
Oh my god, that was terrifying

917
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:53,840
I guess they could just turn the stream on if they're if we have the same password

918
02:37:56,239 --> 02:38:01,690
It worked. That was a really loud scream. I'm sorry. That was fucking horrible

919
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:27,040
Invasions don't work with a password. Oh, all right. Oh, come on

920
02:38:40,379 --> 02:38:42,379
At okay, whoever I invaded

921
02:38:42,459 --> 02:38:44,860
Oh, man, you would you probably went like this

922
02:38:45,659 --> 02:38:47,930
No

923
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:54,489
Just barely missed came right down sliced in the animation landed right next to me

924
02:38:55,209 --> 02:38:58,510
You must you must have been lining that shot up being like, oh my god

925
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:00,829
He actually doesn't know and you just miss

926
02:39:01,549 --> 02:39:04,110
Oh that would that's so sad. I'm so sorry

927
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:14,940
I almost went off with you though. I actually almost fell off with you

928
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:25,389
The lunge attack never works. I honestly don't

929
02:39:26,799 --> 02:39:28,479
I feel like it got worse

930
02:39:28,479 --> 02:39:31,610
I remember in dark souls 1

931
02:39:32,010 --> 02:39:34,520
and dark souls 2

932
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:36,520
Ball r1 was

933
02:39:36,579 --> 02:39:42,409
Insanely good. I feel i'm terrified. I don't want to use it in these newer games. I feel like it's awful

934
02:39:42,409 --> 02:39:48,280
I think I could never get it to work

935
02:39:48,280 --> 02:39:50,360
It still is did they made it harder to hit then probably

936
02:39:51,239 --> 02:39:56,959
What am I doing?

937
02:39:56,959 --> 02:39:58,959
i'm trying to invade

938
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:07,280
Fair mazula should be non-stop invasions at this level. You know, that's a good point

939
02:40:08,569 --> 02:40:11,229
Okay, we'll see if this works

940
02:40:11,229 --> 02:40:15,469
Jump r2 is really good. Yeah jump the jumping r2 is that's one of the probably best move of the whole game

941
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:22,040
This is probably the best single move you can do to anything in the whole game

942
02:40:26,809 --> 02:40:40,000
All right, 10 more seconds and i'm gonna go to fair mazula. All right fucking just die because like i'm not gonna be low

943
02:40:40,159 --> 02:40:41,360
Oh

944
02:40:41,360 --> 02:40:52,030
Reminder that you promised you would eat a glove if the three stooges were I didn't whatever that's doctored footage. I didn't say that

945
02:40:52,590 --> 02:40:59,790
All right fair mazula

946
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:02,479
Where should I go? Just kind of right here

947
02:41:02,959 --> 02:41:06,120
right on the bridge

948
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:24,459
Right here. Yeah passwords don't matter for invasions. Yeah, that's that makes sense though, doesn't it?

949
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:28,350
otherwise, wouldn't you kind of just be able to

950
02:41:29,610 --> 02:41:31,610
farm invasions with your friends

951
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:34,190
I actually don't really know how this works, but

952
02:41:34,430 --> 02:41:57,930
Really? You're having trouble finding people 150 here

953
02:41:58,569 --> 02:42:08,430
Please germa help me beat the last boss. I'm on it right now and it'll be my first win

954
02:42:09,229 --> 02:42:11,600
Yeah, i'm gonna do uh help

955
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:18,670
I'll try to help spam the finger. I go to the one of the other bonfires

956
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:29,309
150 plus is considered over leveled

957
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:36,200
Um, I don't I is it though. I thought maybe like 180 or something one. I was like

958
02:42:36,760 --> 02:42:39,319
120 when I was here like 140

959
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:41,479
Who died?

960
02:42:45,930 --> 02:42:51,530
Who died

961
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:55,290
What somebody's dead? Who the fuck are these people? What's going on?

962
02:42:56,670 --> 02:42:58,670
I came in and somebody died

963
02:43:01,229 --> 02:43:03,229
We didn't even bow yet

964
02:43:03,229 --> 02:43:04,670
What happened?

965
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:11,850
The reason why I I zoned into the game and it was like, oh that person somebody died

966
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:14,729
I was like, oh am I gonna get i'm gonna get returned to my world. I don't know what happened

967
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:21,479
It said recuse and die. Was that another invader?

968
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:29,879
That was a different invader that died and then I came wow. We will look really stupid

969
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,680
Back-to-back invasions and the

970
02:43:34,159 --> 02:43:37,360
I come in and just kind of walk around and die and I didn't even fight anybody

971
02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:43,020
That was so bad. I just kind of fell off the edge and they just bullied me

972
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:49,840
Yeah, there are no rules in it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I gotta

973
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:54,319
I gotta get that into my head

974
02:43:54,319 --> 02:43:56,719
I have to act like a from software

975
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:00,110
NPC i'm gonna show you exactly what that means

976
02:44:06,299 --> 02:44:08,299
Okay, please don't go in the boss room

977
02:44:10,299 --> 02:44:39,159
You're both there you are

978
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:41,559
Boy, this is the actor who is this? This is the actual person

979
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:47,040
What how many people are there? What the fuck?

980
02:44:48,350 --> 02:44:49,629
Hey

981
02:44:49,629 --> 02:44:53,899
What if he's gonna fall off?

982
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:14,079
Host plus two co-op helpers. Oh shit

983
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:24,969
Okay, I get it. I get it. So you I just gotta go for it. I get it. I did. Okay, that was confusing

984
02:45:25,610 --> 02:45:30,379
Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I get it

985
02:45:37,739 --> 02:45:40,030
No mercy

986
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:44,430
There's no honor dude. Stop. Okay. All right. Fine. No honor. There's no honor

987
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,239
Someone in the group defeated the shard bearer

988
02:45:55,629 --> 02:45:59,309
Use the tree sentinel to your advantage. Oh my god, just stand next to it

989
02:46:00,190 --> 02:46:02,760
Stand next to it and taunt

990
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:14,729
Tree sentinel is usually dead

991
02:46:14,889 --> 02:46:45,360
All right, let's go

992
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:54,159
This is bullshit

993
02:46:54,159 --> 02:46:56,159
This is it's bullshit. This is bullshit

994
02:47:00,219 --> 02:47:02,299
Yeah, this is this is absolute. I look like an asshole

995
02:47:06,319 --> 02:47:10,809
Wait, i'm invisible. All right

996
02:47:10,809 --> 02:47:12,250
Where's the other player?

997
02:47:12,250 --> 02:47:14,379
Are there two players?

998
02:47:14,379 --> 02:47:39,149
I don't know how either one of us didn't get hit by that

999
02:47:39,229 --> 02:48:31,389
What the fuck use the explosive flask?

1000
02:48:34,569 --> 02:48:35,450
I

1001
02:48:35,450 --> 02:48:38,440
I mean, it's so

1002
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:39,799
If it was me

1003
02:48:39,799 --> 02:48:43,479
I'm just trying to think of this if this is me doing this like playing and somebody invaded me

1004
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:47,719
And I was fighting the tree sentinel like I had just gotten here maybe like 10 minutes ago

1005
02:48:48,520 --> 02:48:50,440
I'm fighting the tree sentinel

1006
02:48:50,440 --> 02:48:57,239
And somebody invades me and drinks the exploding flask and lols me at the boss. I'd probably fucking be pissed

1007
02:48:58,040 --> 02:49:01,559
I would probably flip out. I'd be like

1008
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:06,520
I would be so mad

1009
02:49:06,520 --> 02:49:09,559
That was me. It was a connection error. Ah, too bad. Good fight though

1010
02:49:10,200 --> 02:49:17,149
Uh, I did try to bm and cheese you and that's uh, that's what I deserve to be disconnected for that

1011
02:49:19,709 --> 02:49:31,739
Here we go. It's like you were waiting for me. You knew I was gonna spawn in this spot

1012
02:49:32,379 --> 02:49:36,590
All right, it's free sentinel alive

1013
02:49:36,829 --> 02:49:39,149
Fuck you killed the tree sentinel you guys played

1014
02:49:40,829 --> 02:49:42,750
All right. Okay easy

1015
02:49:42,750 --> 02:49:50,459
I was I don't know what I was just doing that far. I was trying to freak him out

1016
02:49:55,639 --> 02:50:10,510
Like I don't know why I figured like I don't know sometimes people do like the monkey see monkey do thing

1017
02:50:11,149 --> 02:50:15,389
Where he I jumped up on the balcony and jumped and people I i'm kind of one of these people

1018
02:50:15,389 --> 02:50:19,069
I'd be like, all right fine. I'll do that too. I'll show you i'm not an idiot. I can do it and then they jump up

1019
02:50:27,319 --> 02:50:29,319
All right, let's actually go for it

1020
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:42,090
Duel so you don't get ganked and dunked on. Oh, I mean, it's fun regardless, honestly

1021
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:57,680
Okay, i'm not sure if they've been here yet

1022
02:50:58,239 --> 02:51:46,969
Oh my god

1023
02:51:47,049 --> 02:51:49,049
Why I think it's I think I think I

1024
02:51:56,120 --> 02:52:00,799
This is so scuffed

1025
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:02,329
They just hit a wall

1026
02:52:02,329 --> 02:52:04,329
Your sword hit a wall

1027
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:11,950
I'm, so sorry if that was you that was kind of horrible

1028
02:52:28,489 --> 02:52:31,129
All right. I'm gonna go somewhere else somewhere. That's not just a bridge

1029
02:52:31,930 --> 02:52:42,520
On the rooftops here. Yeah, like over here somewhere somewhere weird

1030
02:52:43,239 --> 02:52:44,959
I like this

1031
02:52:44,959 --> 02:52:51,500
Is they gonna be jumping around here, especially in this area right there? They're gonna be jumping to that area

1032
02:52:51,899 --> 02:53:10,440
Here I can fight. It's a good spot. I want to fight somebody right here

1033
02:53:11,079 --> 02:53:25,600
Who's willing to do it? Let's get some signs right here. You're willing to do it. You want to fight me on this ledge

1034
02:53:26,079 --> 02:53:40,329
When I come back, I think they're up top

1035
02:53:41,610 --> 02:54:40,190
Okay, get up there

1036
02:54:40,190 --> 02:55:08,799
This poor guy

1037
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:14,590
The birds were dead up here

1038
02:55:14,590 --> 02:55:19,709
Were you trying to run off the edge? I think he was trying to jump off. I think he was trying to to get killed

1039
02:55:20,110 --> 02:55:24,459
If he'd stayed up there, he would probably had a better shot

1040
02:55:28,219 --> 02:55:29,819
Why scarlet rot?

1041
02:55:29,819 --> 02:55:38,250
Uh, we got any signs here?

1042
02:55:38,250 --> 02:55:40,559
Okay, who wants to where's oh my god

1043
02:55:43,049 --> 02:55:53,479
baby dragon sure

1044
02:55:53,479 --> 02:55:55,159
try

1045
02:55:55,159 --> 02:56:03,709
Okay, how you doing?

1046
02:56:04,030 --> 02:56:06,030
So this is a 1v1 up here

1047
02:56:06,829 --> 02:56:08,520
Gotta be careful

1048
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:11,579
One wrong dodge gets killed ready?

1049
02:56:12,139 --> 02:56:33,739
Let's go. What the fuck?

1050
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:52,719
What the hell

1051
02:56:52,719 --> 02:56:59,770
That was insane

1052
02:56:59,770 --> 02:57:02,329
No disrespect, but when you laugh, why doesn't your face move?

1053
02:57:16,409 --> 02:57:19,229
What happened there though? That was fucking crazy

1054
02:57:19,790 --> 02:57:31,930
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to do that again. What happened there?

1055
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:35,920
It moves a lot that you

1056
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:41,819
Oh, so she jumped off turned and did the move. That was crazy

1057
02:57:43,239 --> 02:57:46,120
I see. So that was the last that was the latch last ditch play

1058
02:57:47,079 --> 02:57:50,360
That was a oh fuck. I'm gonna fall. I gotta kill him now

1059
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:58,940
Why doesn't your face move?

1060
02:58:01,290 --> 02:58:03,290
All right. Uh, who else we got?

1061
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:06,969
All right. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna we gotta we gotta bring in the barf drinker

1062
02:58:08,889 --> 02:58:11,129
I don't know what the barf drinker is gonna do up here, but good luck

1063
02:58:15,719 --> 02:58:22,379
Does your face not move? All right barf, let's go

1064
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:59,879
He's going for the cannon

1065
02:58:59,879 --> 02:59:01,879
Oh barf drinker. Good try

1066
02:59:11,559 --> 02:59:21,129
All right

1067
02:59:21,129 --> 02:59:22,250
who uh

1068
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:24,649
Who wants to go for it?

1069
02:59:24,649 --> 02:59:25,770
Okay

1070
02:59:25,770 --> 02:59:28,989
Who wants to go for it? Who wants to go for uh?

1071
02:59:30,270 --> 02:59:33,340
This is gonna be a disaster

1072
02:59:36,090 --> 02:59:38,649
You can wear a helmet a helmet of your choice

1073
02:59:39,290 --> 02:59:51,549
I don't know if I like that. I kind of like that. I kind of like this

1074
02:59:56,989 --> 02:59:58,989
All right, we gotta go. This is a grinch

1075
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:08,860
Is there a block or a parry or anything?

1076
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:50,889
Here we go. All right grinch, you know the rules. This is gonna take fucking forever

1077
03:00:58,040 --> 03:00:59,319
Uh-oh

1078
03:00:59,319 --> 03:01:16,879
I just baited it up

1079
03:01:16,879 --> 03:01:31,870
Damn it

1080
03:01:31,870 --> 03:01:33,309
oops

1081
03:01:33,309 --> 03:01:34,909
I was gonna go

1082
03:01:34,909 --> 03:01:57,079
That was fun. Let's not do that ever again. All right. I have a new game

1083
03:01:58,040 --> 03:02:01,209
the new game is

1084
03:02:01,209 --> 03:02:03,209
and you knock me off this platform

1085
03:02:03,610 --> 03:02:11,879
In one minute i'm gonna look like a total dickhead. You have to get you have to knock me off the platform in one minute

1086
03:02:11,959 --> 03:02:14,120
I don't how however you do it. Whatever means necessary

1087
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:17,680
All right, how much strength do I need to put on some of these great shields?

1088
03:02:18,399 --> 03:02:21,930
Okay, I can put this one on this is 90. I know I need 100

1089
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,879
28 30

1090
03:02:26,879 --> 03:02:28,649
20, okay

1091
03:02:28,649 --> 03:02:32,090
Uh, i'm going to go respec to 99 endurance

1092
03:02:33,450 --> 03:02:38,760
And like 30 strength

1093
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:59,049
We're back. You have one minute to get rid of me. Uh, yeah my current stats here. Somebody remember this

1094
03:02:59,530 --> 03:03:09,559
Because I won't here we go

1095
03:03:09,639 --> 03:03:25,069
This is so annoying

1096
03:03:25,389 --> 03:03:27,629
All right 95 I need not mine

1097
03:03:28,510 --> 03:03:37,850
I need enough to hold two great shields in my hand 20 27 do it

1098
03:03:38,409 --> 03:03:46,840
30 strength should do it right

1099
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:48,600
Soft cap is 80

1100
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:50,600
strength per shield 35

1101
03:03:50,840 --> 03:04:01,600
60 is soft cap

1102
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:03,360
60 60 60

1103
03:04:03,360 --> 03:04:08,379
And we use any weapon you can use anything you want you can use literally anything in the game

1104
03:04:08,780 --> 03:04:22,889
No, I want I this I think this is fine 80 is hard cap. Yeah, okay. I think this is fine

1105
03:04:23,530 --> 03:04:41,229
Am I going to be naked? No, absolutely not. Uh

1106
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:44,030
I need the heaviest shield in the whole game

1107
03:04:45,069 --> 03:04:46,590
Probably one. It's probably this

1108
03:04:46,590 --> 03:05:12,219
Uh, what's the heaviest armor in the whole game? Probably this right the lionel stuff or is it the pumpkin head?

1109
03:05:15,659 --> 03:05:37,760
Old goat old goat everything. Yeah now I need

1110
03:05:38,719 --> 03:05:39,840
uh

1111
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:41,840
Greatly increases maximum hp

1112
03:05:42,639 --> 03:05:48,379
I need

1113
03:05:48,379 --> 03:05:53,040
Uh the equipment. I don't care about equipment alone. I need

1114
03:05:53,520 --> 03:06:06,940
Extra enormously boost physical damage negation. What else vastly magic defense?

1115
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:16,219
and under stamina

1116
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:47,819
Good luck shield talisman. I have it on raises defense when hp is at maximum go upgrade the shields

1117
03:06:49,159 --> 03:06:51,129
I don't have it

1118
03:06:51,129 --> 03:06:58,079
Should I go upgrade these bolts plus 10? I feel like that's such a waste

1119
03:07:01,979 --> 03:07:07,610
At least like plus eight or plus nine. Yeah, I don't have the runes to do that

1120
03:07:07,930 --> 03:07:10,090
I have remembrances that i'm not going to use I got a lot

1121
03:07:11,549 --> 03:07:13,549
All right, i'm gonna both these shields are gonna get plus nine

1122
03:07:25,950 --> 03:07:28,190
Oh nice congrats

1123
03:07:32,299 --> 03:07:33,899
30 000 should do it

1124
03:07:33,899 --> 03:07:41,899
You can only block with one of them. I think the one on the right is more effective, right?

1125
03:07:42,540 --> 03:07:44,569
Let's see if I can do it

1126
03:07:44,569 --> 03:07:50,559
Which one is better the one on my right hand is more damage negation, right?

1127
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:57,399
Upgrading shield does literally nothing for their defense. Does it do anything?

1128
03:08:00,379 --> 03:08:02,379
Just increases the damage. Oh, okay

1129
03:08:07,690 --> 03:08:09,930
Fingerprint shield has 100 physical damage

1130
03:08:12,459 --> 03:08:16,379
Makes them use less stamina when blocking it increases. Okay, i'm just gonna do it who cares

1131
03:08:18,510 --> 03:08:21,149
If we break your guard then can we yeah, you just however you can get rid of me

1132
03:08:26,110 --> 03:08:28,110
This one's good though, right?

1133
03:08:28,190 --> 03:08:31,069
This thing I think this is the one what I don't want to go get the other shield

1134
03:08:32,909 --> 03:08:34,909
And how how how easy is it?

1135
03:08:38,989 --> 03:08:48,059
Is it like simple to go get it?

1136
03:08:48,059 --> 03:08:51,819
Not very. All right. Well, i'm just gonna do which one is better for defense. This one's probably this one here

1137
03:08:52,139 --> 03:08:59,180
All right, i'm going for it

1138
03:08:59,739 --> 03:09:09,920
Hold on how many do I need?

1139
03:09:10,559 --> 03:09:13,680
I have access to every single stone in the game besides the plus 10 one

1140
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:19,719
All right smithing stone

1141
03:09:19,719 --> 03:09:22,299
How many do I need?

1142
03:09:22,299 --> 03:09:24,299
a 15 30 29

1143
03:09:24,780 --> 03:09:26,780
25 i've said shitload of these

1144
03:09:31,209 --> 03:09:35,290
12 per step. All right. Well, we I don't have any plus one smithing stones

1145
03:09:38,729 --> 03:09:44,170
I need you don't even have the basic ones. You don't have access to smithing stones one. What the fuck

1146
03:09:49,549 --> 03:09:51,709
You missed out on a lot of early dungeons

1147
03:09:55,319 --> 03:09:57,479
Whatever. I'm just going i'm going to summon people

1148
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:06,030
Zero exploration andy that's not true

1149
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:26,250
So I got one in my back and one on my front. I'm good. Let's do it. Good luck everybody. You have uh, you have one minute

1150
03:10:27,129 --> 03:10:33,069
Get rid of me. I'll knock you off. Okay

1151
03:10:33,950 --> 03:10:50,440
I'm gonna get right in the middle

1152
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:52,840
By the way, I can I can push you if I want to

1153
03:10:56,239 --> 03:11:19,280
It's just bob-omb's battlefield, man

1154
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:30,520
Oh shit, not gonna happen

1155
03:11:46,620 --> 03:11:50,540
It was the first person. Yeah, but I shouldn't have been attacked. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it

1156
03:11:50,540 --> 03:11:52,299
I shouldn't be attacking

1157
03:11:52,299 --> 03:12:18,639
Congratulations, you knocked the guy off. I should I know attacking I can knock you off too, by the way stay still

1158
03:12:36,110 --> 03:12:37,469
Sorry

1159
03:12:37,469 --> 03:12:47,049
This is so annoying

1160
03:12:47,049 --> 03:12:49,049
All right, you got through the defense

1161
03:13:12,299 --> 03:13:29,600
Oh, you got it. All right, whatever then we said this sucks. All right, this one's for

1162
03:13:30,959 --> 03:13:34,329
This is this is dumb who cares

1163
03:13:36,780 --> 03:13:39,739
Oh, you gotta come in and notice. I feel like i'm in like the eighth grade

1164
03:13:40,219 --> 03:13:45,260
This is like the oh man, let's put on a bunch of gear and you try to knock me off

1165
03:13:45,899 --> 03:13:52,170
I'm in the i'm in the seventh grade. No

1166
03:13:54,920 --> 03:14:08,889
Hmm. All right fine. You get me

1167
03:14:09,979 --> 03:14:15,180
In the first move that must have walked out

1168
03:14:18,430 --> 03:14:31,120
Okay, this sucks

1169
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:34,000
All right, this sucks. This is stupid. This sucks

1170
03:14:36,680 --> 03:14:45,309
That's all right. Whatever that was like whatever but wait, I have enough strength to put on

1171
03:14:46,190 --> 03:14:48,190
All right. Now i'm gonna play with like a big two-hander or something

1172
03:14:48,829 --> 03:14:52,409
I don't have any weapon upgrades. Fuck. I gotta go back. Okay, here's what i'm doing

1173
03:14:53,049 --> 03:15:08,969
That was awful two handing a shield. Yeah

1174
03:15:12,510 --> 03:15:14,750
i'm gonna do my other uh

1175
03:15:14,829 --> 03:15:45,690
shithead build

1176
03:15:45,690 --> 03:15:56,889
99 int you have so many mana flasks pvp. Yeah, but I wanted to be able to hold the same move down

1177
03:16:03,930 --> 03:16:05,930
Actually make you cast faster

1178
03:16:06,649 --> 03:16:33,639
That's true. I can't move

1179
03:16:34,829 --> 03:16:36,829
All right, okay

1180
03:16:36,829 --> 03:16:48,319
uh, how about

1181
03:16:48,319 --> 03:16:50,940
Okay, raise intelligence. Yeah

1182
03:16:51,899 --> 03:16:55,290
I like this one. They can stay on

1183
03:16:55,370 --> 03:17:02,409
uh this one

1184
03:17:02,409 --> 03:17:04,090
and um

1185
03:17:04,090 --> 03:17:10,569
fp

1186
03:17:10,569 --> 03:17:19,069
Okay, use the sore seal. Oh, that's right

1187
03:17:22,760 --> 03:17:24,280
This doesn't do

1188
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:26,079
um

1189
03:17:26,079 --> 03:17:27,520
Yeah, the stats I want

1190
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:34,940
Whatever. Okay. My equipment load is so bad

1191
03:17:35,659 --> 03:17:52,059
I'm still at medium. How that seems impossible. What?

1192
03:17:52,860 --> 03:17:59,319
Oh, I didn't have a weapon equipped

1193
03:17:59,399 --> 03:18:03,840
All right, just give me the staff

1194
03:18:03,840 --> 03:18:06,000
Now it's heavy load. Shit. Okay. Well, that makes sense

1195
03:18:13,049 --> 03:18:16,809
Okay. Now I want to do moves that I want to do the fp flask

1196
03:18:17,770 --> 03:18:24,120
They could sneeze and kill you I know but i'm gonna be able just to spam moves

1197
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:29,200
If I touch somebody with a move they did

1198
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:36,620
Where do I want to do this?

1199
03:18:36,620 --> 03:18:41,290
How about like right? How about where um?

1200
03:18:41,770 --> 03:18:48,780
Yeah, like down here. No, no one's gonna be there. Maybe like one of these uh, like the church or the hallowee tree

1201
03:18:49,340 --> 03:18:51,639
Or the foot of the forge

1202
03:18:51,639 --> 03:18:58,200
The image is not going to be that crazy. Well, whatever

1203
03:18:58,920 --> 03:19:03,309
Now if our result was fine, let's go here

1204
03:19:04,190 --> 03:19:08,729
Worst build that takes five minutes to set up

1205
03:19:09,290 --> 03:19:15,440
All right. I need to put on the fp stuff. All right, that's just an experiment. Let's see what happened

1206
03:19:27,530 --> 03:19:29,450
I want the

1207
03:19:29,450 --> 03:19:31,850
All fp consumption and the magic boost

1208
03:19:32,729 --> 03:19:41,559
Where is it?

1209
03:19:41,559 --> 03:19:43,319
Is there a magic boost one?

1210
03:19:43,319 --> 03:19:48,030
I don't think so

1211
03:19:48,030 --> 03:19:49,149
stamina

1212
03:19:49,149 --> 03:19:59,290
Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Here we go. This is so bad, but whatever

1213
03:19:59,930 --> 03:20:06,360
I'm just gonna be annoying. I'm thinking the moon

1214
03:20:07,559 --> 03:20:11,149
I have a ton of decks too. All right

1215
03:20:11,149 --> 03:20:13,360
What would be annoying here?

1216
03:20:13,360 --> 03:20:15,129
probably

1217
03:20:15,129 --> 03:20:18,219
this

1218
03:20:18,219 --> 03:20:19,899
probably

1219
03:20:19,899 --> 03:20:25,450
Maybe like collapsing stars. That would be kind of annoying

1220
03:20:26,090 --> 03:20:32,270
I'll try this

1221
03:20:32,270 --> 03:20:34,110
magic downpour

1222
03:20:34,110 --> 03:20:36,110
That's a good idea. Actually i'll do that

1223
03:20:43,370 --> 03:20:45,370
Yeah, the moon's gonna take too long

1224
03:20:46,139 --> 03:20:48,139
founding rain of stars

1225
03:20:48,139 --> 03:20:49,420
or

1226
03:20:49,420 --> 03:20:53,920
I think i'm gonna try founding rain of stars. I feel like that's really irritating

1227
03:20:55,159 --> 03:20:57,159
Magic downpour i'll try it fine

1228
03:20:58,120 --> 03:21:15,149
Here we go

1229
03:21:15,149 --> 03:21:17,389
Do all mana flasks you didn't die in one hit. Oh, you're right

1230
03:21:18,430 --> 03:21:19,549
It's all right

1231
03:21:19,549 --> 03:21:27,559
I'm gonna confuse the person that I invade though because they're gonna hit me one time and i'm gonna die

1232
03:21:42,510 --> 03:21:48,620
All the way over there

1233
03:21:48,620 --> 03:21:50,620
Oh, you're so far away

1234
03:21:50,860 --> 03:21:58,139
How am I gonna get over there?

1235
03:21:58,139 --> 03:22:08,569
Use the finger again. How do I do it? How do I use the finger again?

1236
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:23,899
Oh repeat

1237
03:22:23,899 --> 03:22:53,610
Ready? Here we go. Come on. I want to do my stupid shit. That actually might be really good. What about crystal release?

1238
03:22:55,690 --> 03:22:57,690
Oh, that's annoying too. Okay

1239
03:22:58,090 --> 03:23:11,549
This one is what does this one do? That's actually probably really annoying too

1240
03:23:15,579 --> 03:23:19,819
magic downpour

1241
03:23:19,819 --> 03:23:22,860
Magic downpour I think is the best one to do with this much intelligence

1242
03:23:28,489 --> 03:23:37,120
Quickly, hurry, hurry quickly. Oh my fucking god. I'm not even close to that

1243
03:23:37,680 --> 03:23:58,280
I'm going far away

1244
03:23:58,280 --> 03:24:00,280
This is a bad place to be too. This is gonna be great

1245
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:10,809
Are you eating a glove if you're having this many invasions problems? No, i'm just in a bad i'm doing it in a bad spot

1246
03:24:10,889 --> 03:24:13,770
Here we go. This is better. All right. Here we go. Three two one action

1247
03:24:17,290 --> 03:24:19,290
What the fuck thought that was them

1248
03:24:19,450 --> 03:24:42,920
Where are they?

1249
03:24:42,920 --> 03:24:46,200
What no, fuck. I thought they were right around the corner. No

1250
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:56,250
I thought they were gonna I heard the fighting right there. All right, i'm just fucking running at them. No more hiding

1251
03:24:56,809 --> 03:24:58,809
No more and my voice is doing the thing

1252
03:25:03,049 --> 03:25:07,850
Paramazula is too content. There's like too many bosses. Everyone that's here is doing one of the two bosses here

1253
03:25:08,569 --> 03:25:23,469
Where did it put me?

1254
03:25:23,469 --> 03:25:46,940
Where the fuck are they?

1255
03:25:46,940 --> 03:25:48,459
Are they above me?

1256
03:25:48,459 --> 03:25:55,790
How do I get up there? I don't I don't remember the layout of this place. I did it one time. How do I get up?

1257
03:25:56,350 --> 03:26:07,159
This does stairs go to these stairs don't go anywhere. I actually don't know how to get the fuck up there

1258
03:26:13,659 --> 03:26:16,379
God damn it this fucking inventory. I just put

1259
03:26:17,020 --> 03:26:30,319
I gotta get a fair mazilla fair mazilla is like chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk and there's two bosses

1260
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:47,319
Everybody's doing it. No fuck this place. No, there's like three bosses like here here in here

1261
03:26:47,399 --> 03:26:49,399

03:33:54,559 --> 03:33:56,559

03:33:57,149 --> 03:34:05,370
What do I do?

1306
03:34:05,370 --> 03:34:07,370
That was insane though. What the fuck?

1307
03:34:07,690 --> 03:34:23,260
Okay, uh, let's do science. All right our speed wagon

1308
03:34:23,340 --> 03:34:24,540

03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:26,969
Yeah, I tried to summon you already didn't work

1310
03:34:27,290 --> 03:34:33,959
All right. How about you? This is gonna be so bad now

1311
03:34:36,829 --> 03:34:38,909
I mean who knows I might be I should actually kill somebody

1312
03:34:54,000 --> 03:35:05,280
Well at 153 soul level I was more concerned about my like computer crashing

1313
03:35:14,989 --> 03:35:18,030
Why do I have like five vigor? It's because this is

1314
03:35:18,989 --> 03:35:22,590
I was doing an invasion build where I would go in and try to kill people in like one hit

1315
03:35:22,989 --> 03:35:24,989
I got embarrassed three times in a row

1316
03:35:27,020 --> 03:35:30,239
and then I uh

1317
03:35:30,239 --> 03:35:32,239
And then and then I had to come back here

1318
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:45,840
They seem friendly. You should still back up the save. I I mean as long as they're not, you know

1319
03:35:46,760 --> 03:35:58,809
Try to get mad. I don't know this cross region stop west to east coast

1320
03:36:04,829 --> 03:36:08,159
Uh, i'm sorry. It didn't work

1321
03:36:08,159 --> 03:36:10,159
There's a classic barf drinker

1322
03:36:10,639 --> 03:36:12,639
All right captain luke harrier

1323
03:36:29,229 --> 03:36:49,559
You're gonna die twice and spend 10 minutes trying to fix the npc build. Oh, I just realized you have to hit me once

1324
03:36:49,639 --> 03:37:08,120
All right, just let's go

1325
03:37:08,120 --> 03:37:11,799
What the fuck? All right. I'm done. I'm done with this build. I'm done. This build is just

1326
03:37:12,760 --> 03:37:18,680
I just why am I using magic downpour by the way magic downpour is literally a serial block skill

1327
03:37:18,920 --> 03:37:21,799
You get it you use it once and then you fucking delete it from your bar. You never put it back on

1328
03:37:22,120 --> 03:37:26,159
This is no reason to put it on

1329
03:37:26,159 --> 03:37:29,840
There's no reason to put this back on. All right, i'm just let's go the let me go. Let's

1330
03:37:31,579 --> 03:37:32,540
So bad

1331
03:37:32,540 --> 03:37:39,469
I just wait

1332
03:37:39,469 --> 03:37:41,229
I'll be right back. Nobody move

1333
03:37:41,229 --> 03:37:50,829
All right, let me see. Let me what do I got my

1334
03:37:50,829 --> 03:38:00,110
Okay, it was 50

1335
03:38:00,909 --> 03:38:03,479
I believe it's 50

1336
03:38:03,479 --> 03:38:04,440
30

1337
03:38:04,440 --> 03:38:06,440
Or like no 30 maybe like 35

1338
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:13,450
Let's do it. I gotta be one. We'll do 35. It sounds better

1339
03:38:13,930 --> 03:38:17,209
Okay

1340
03:38:17,209 --> 03:38:23,079
25 decks should I even have decks at this point? I probably yeah

1341
03:38:27,770 --> 03:38:30,520
65 intelligence

1342
03:38:30,520 --> 03:38:45,100
Wait, that's including items that I had on isn't it? I think that's kind of I think that's pretty good

1343
03:38:46,860 --> 03:38:53,149
Does not include this does not include items. I think that's because of the baby rattle was what was my decks?

1344
03:38:54,670 --> 03:38:56,670
Uh, it was 25 65

1345
03:38:57,209 --> 03:39:02,520
56

1346
03:39:02,840 --> 03:39:05,479
Oh my god, I have no points in endurance. That's why

1347
03:39:06,200 --> 03:39:28,059
All right. Um mine is a dump stat. You can just chug for more. Yeah, I gotta pee again

1348
03:39:28,700 --> 03:39:34,350
pretty

1349
03:39:34,350 --> 03:39:38,600
565 I think this is fine. I'm actually I want like 30

1350
03:39:39,319 --> 03:39:43,229
30 mind

1351
03:39:43,229 --> 03:39:45,049
30 30

1352
03:39:45,049 --> 03:40:02,559
That's fine. Yeah, that's that's pretty much where it was before

1353
03:40:03,520 --> 03:40:20,719
I could wear something better than this though

1354
03:40:20,719 --> 03:40:22,719
Back to reality here

1355
03:40:22,719 --> 03:40:30,239
It's not the right one. Okay, here we go

1356
03:40:30,879 --> 03:40:33,760
It's time for a couple more pvp duels after I pee

1357
03:40:34,479 --> 03:40:37,360
I'll do one before I pee same place

1358
03:40:42,120 --> 03:40:49,159
Have I been playing for four hours?

1359
03:40:49,159 --> 03:40:54,989
That's kind of blown by

1360
03:40:55,069 --> 03:40:57,600
I must be having fun

1361
03:40:57,600 --> 03:41:04,760
I don't know. I just summoned somebody I think

1362
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:10,329
Tired

1363
03:41:10,329 --> 03:41:19,159
I don't know tired low

1364
03:41:19,239 --> 03:41:23,399
Oh, I have such these spells suck. It's okay. I really only need these two

1365
03:41:24,200 --> 03:41:33,360
Tired hollow. Okay, it's because of ho

1366
03:41:34,079 --> 03:42:02,940
Oh, that was rough

1367
03:42:10,829 --> 03:42:12,829
Oh good game. Damn it

1368
03:42:13,709 --> 03:42:16,030
Good game. I thought you were gonna come in a little bit further

1369
03:42:16,590 --> 03:42:30,040
Were you gonna help people fight bosses? Yeah, i'll do this for a little bit longer. That's that was a tuba reaction to

1370
03:42:30,909 --> 03:42:43,129
Becoming aware of that europina

1371
03:42:43,450 --> 03:42:46,120
who else

1372
03:42:46,120 --> 03:42:48,239
Luna

1373
03:42:48,239 --> 03:43:02,350
Pick me strong spells, but you should help people with milania

1374
03:43:04,489 --> 03:43:09,479
I will stand and I will help people outside of different bosses. I will that sounds fun

1375
03:43:09,799 --> 03:43:18,909
I guess I could take this right wondrous physique blaster. Okay

1376
03:43:27,610 --> 03:43:28,889
We good

1377
03:43:28,889 --> 03:43:48,000
You good. Are you good? Hey

1378
03:43:48,639 --> 03:44:23,229
Okay, here we go

1379
03:44:23,229 --> 03:44:30,440
Good fight. Yeah, i'll do cross region in a minute

1380
03:44:33,829 --> 03:44:44,200
Stealth archer. I don't know but I don't know about this one. This one's kind of freaking me out

1381
03:44:44,600 --> 03:44:48,729
Does that mean that the character is going to be invisible and they're going to shoot me with bow and arrow?

1382
03:44:53,479 --> 03:44:55,000
That's kind of sus

1383
03:44:55,000 --> 03:45:39,840
Dude, you got this is the best class in the game. Hey, what's up? All right. What do you got stealth archer?

1384
03:45:54,680 --> 03:46:05,100
I get it. I can see you you move into clothes. I you shot in the sky. I'm so confused

1385
03:46:05,180 --> 03:46:07,579
Okay, i've never nobody plays with bows in this game, huh?

1386
03:46:08,299 --> 03:47:12,649
Bow seems so cool. God damn it

1387
03:47:13,290 --> 03:47:20,649
Those are cool looking they're like little crystals

1388
03:47:31,850 --> 03:47:37,260
Fight that was actually really cool. What are those arrows?

1389
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:54,729
That was really cool. They're rainbow stone arrows. That's really all I actually kind of want to play as that character

1390
03:47:54,889 --> 03:47:58,280
Oh

1391
03:48:07,450 --> 03:48:15,579
My computer crashed

1392
03:48:15,579 --> 03:48:21,840
Did my whole computer crash?

1393
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:45,760
Come on

1394
03:48:45,760 --> 03:48:48,159
Can you level up a few? Do you have to be the exact same level?

1395
03:48:51,639 --> 03:48:53,239
I don't think you have to be the same exact level

1396
03:48:53,239 --> 03:49:07,280
Was it like it's like five level range 10 level range the level? Oh level doesn't matter with the password. Okay

1397
03:49:07,840 --> 03:49:21,180
So wait, so that means that people could I could be fighting people that are way way lower than me, right?

1398
03:49:21,659 --> 03:49:42,750
Technically. Yeah. Yeah, I thought I got banned. I was like, oh no, I saw the pop-up the second pop-up and i'm like

1399
03:49:43,549 --> 03:49:46,909
Oh, no

1400
03:49:46,909 --> 03:50:07,870
I have not used seeing a second pop-up window. I think that was just an actual crash

1401
03:50:11,899 --> 03:50:17,770
Which so what happened between dark souls 3?

1402
03:50:18,469 --> 03:50:20,469
Sekiro and this game

1403
03:50:21,370 --> 03:50:22,489
because

1404
03:50:22,489 --> 03:50:24,489
game crap like hardware

1405
03:50:26,239 --> 03:50:28,079
Those didn't happen in sekiro

1406
03:50:28,079 --> 03:50:32,719
They didn't happen in dark souls 3 either. I don't remember it happening

1407
03:50:33,360 --> 03:50:35,360
Did the game crash one time when I played?

1408
03:50:35,920 --> 03:50:38,760
Because open world all the shaders maybe yeah

1409
03:50:39,319 --> 03:50:41,559
All right. Yeah, let me go p i'll be right back

1410
03:50:41,559 --> 03:54:43,930

1411
03:54:44,409 --> 03:54:45,930
I'm back

1412
03:54:45,930 --> 03:54:51,319
Okay, so we'll do a few more of these pvp rounds and then

1413
03:54:52,440 --> 03:54:57,870
Uh, we'll do some summons to do bosses. That sounds fun. It's cross region on

1414
03:54:58,350 --> 03:55:00,350
No, that's i'll end with that

1415
03:55:00,350 --> 03:55:04,959
We'll do that like in an hour or two

1416
03:55:04,959 --> 03:55:12,120
Hello and the audio back on

1417
03:55:20,600 --> 03:55:22,680
Alrighty

1418
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:24,680
Cross region, you know, let's just do it now

03:55:37,120 --> 03:55:39,920
Uh cross region perform matchmaking. Okay

1421
03:55:40,799 --> 03:55:43,870
Do I have to reset of the game?

1422
03:55:43,870 --> 03:55:58,219
I wonder if it worked. We'll do like a few more five to ten more

1423
03:55:58,780 --> 03:56:02,159
What do you?

1424
03:56:02,159 --> 03:56:07,629
okay, uh, should we go against should we go against the jeremy elbertson with the um

1425
03:56:09,159 --> 03:56:21,530
Let's go. Are you wearing is it wearing the same armor that I am?

1426
03:56:28,110 --> 03:56:36,110
Clone fight is this the real jeremy elbertson?

1427
03:56:40,600 --> 03:56:45,229
All right, just going for it. You get the big shield and think that shoots fire. I know that for a fact

1428
03:56:51,360 --> 03:57:00,190
Walk forward with it

1429
03:57:00,190 --> 03:57:09,819
Oh, I got through the shield

1430
03:57:09,819 --> 03:57:11,819
Oh, you've no idea how badly I want to backstab

1431
03:57:19,639 --> 03:57:26,360
He's just running

1432
03:57:26,360 --> 03:57:35,500
Get over here. How's it charlie brown?

1433
03:57:36,059 --> 03:57:40,489
Does a charlie brown yell in this game?

1434
03:57:43,500 --> 03:57:46,760
I've never heard that before

1435
03:57:47,799 --> 03:57:52,750
Oh, it's already on okay

1436
03:57:52,750 --> 03:57:54,750
based buffalo

1437
03:57:54,750 --> 03:57:56,700
Now the bow user

1438
03:57:56,700 --> 03:58:00,829
The bows are cool. Hold on. What else we got? Uh

1439
03:58:02,219 --> 03:58:03,420
based buffalo

1440
03:58:03,420 --> 03:58:07,129
I think so. Let's try it

1441
03:58:07,209 --> 03:58:31,469
I think it's the bow is fun. Nobody's using the black bow for some reason

1442
03:58:32,110 --> 03:58:35,389
Uh sl means soul level. I know it's probably wrong for elden ring, but

1443
03:58:35,950 --> 03:58:43,370
Okay, I need to put that on my bar, too. Right? Like let me just say hello

1444
03:58:44,010 --> 03:58:48,409
Okay, here we go

1445
03:58:48,409 --> 03:59:18,719
shit

1446
03:59:18,719 --> 03:59:19,600
Oh

1447
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:20,879
close

1448
03:59:20,879 --> 03:59:23,819
Oh going for chip damage. That's what it is

1449
03:59:26,110 --> 03:59:53,930
Good fight good fight one of those arrows kills me so if I had of them would really

1450
03:59:54,250 --> 03:59:56,889
Is it those those not do that much damage? I wasn't really paying that much attention

1451
03:59:58,190 --> 04:00:02,809
I was trying to see how much they hurt for

1452
04:00:02,809 --> 04:00:06,379
That was an interesting build though. How do you build a character?

1453
04:00:07,020 --> 04:00:10,700
So you'd be able to use a great sword and a bow effectively at the same time just

1454
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:12,379
quality

1455
04:00:12,379 --> 04:00:13,819
Does that work?

1456
04:00:13,819 --> 04:00:17,469
The character's ugly

1457
04:00:17,469 --> 04:00:37,610
Why do you just take damage? I like that one you're moving around kind of weird

1458
04:00:38,250 --> 04:00:39,290
I don't know

1459
04:00:39,290 --> 04:00:42,889
I don't like how weird you're moving around. I don't like how weird you're moving around. I don't like this

1460
04:00:43,770 --> 04:00:49,280
Where is this person? Okay. Um

1461
04:00:52,120 --> 04:00:54,040
Oh, no, don't drink

1462
04:00:54,040 --> 04:01:06,379
All right, but seriously though like what's even happening the guy was connecting from the moon

1463
04:01:15,260 --> 04:01:19,899
Cross region omega low cross. I know but whatever it don't matter

1464
04:01:21,520 --> 04:01:26,639
I like your name birdbrain

1465
04:01:26,639 --> 04:01:28,639
Oh, come on. What the fuck

1466
04:01:29,280 --> 04:01:34,879
Why?

1467
04:01:34,879 --> 04:01:36,639
Why do I keep crashing?

1468
04:01:36,639 --> 04:01:55,549
Uh, that's not that's not the multiplayer. That's just the game. I think your hard drive is all no my hard drive is not all like

1469
04:01:56,350 --> 04:02:07,600
Bunged up. All right. It's fine. It's a virus. They're sending it to you through multiplayer

1470
04:02:20,799 --> 04:02:22,799
Crypto miner installed

1471
04:02:35,520 --> 04:02:37,520
Uh-huh. I know I know I know I know

1472
04:02:37,840 --> 04:02:42,579
What's the password?

1473
04:02:42,579 --> 04:02:52,340
Cheese doctor cheese doctor. This is ramander from the toontown national bank that you still owed chad a debt to play toontown

1474
04:02:59,260 --> 04:03:16,799
I'm gonna say okay if this crashes again, i'm just gonna go do boss summons because what the hell what is this?

1475
04:03:17,360 --> 04:03:22,049
Do I dare?

1476
04:03:22,049 --> 04:03:25,709
summon

1477
04:03:25,709 --> 04:03:28,030
Do I dare summon hog rider?

1478
04:03:41,540 --> 04:03:43,899
that mask that

1479
04:04:03,280 --> 04:04:05,649
Torch interesting

1480
04:04:07,840 --> 04:04:12,379
Welcome to the game hog rider. You're gonna fight me with a torch. I feel like this is gonna go

1481
04:04:13,020 --> 04:04:15,020
Oh my god, this is fucking weird

1482
04:04:16,049 --> 04:04:18,940
Is this weird?

1483
04:04:18,940 --> 04:04:20,940
Can you upgrade the torch?

1484
04:04:21,100 --> 04:05:01,440
That was cool. That was really good fight. That was really cool. That weapon was actually

1485
04:05:02,239 --> 04:05:07,680
Can you actually play through the game with a torch?

1486
04:05:12,719 --> 04:05:15,360
Tvp and from software games is atrocious because of netcode

1487
04:05:17,250 --> 04:05:22,450
And I mean it actually really hasn't felt that bad tonight. It really hasn't it felt pretty good actually

1488
04:05:23,549 --> 04:05:25,549
But yeah, I mean sometimes yeah

1489
04:05:27,860 --> 04:05:31,139
I don't know what what is this? I don't I don't know what that says

1490
04:05:34,340 --> 04:05:36,260
First has like the bug stuff

1491
04:05:36,260 --> 04:05:38,450
sorcery

1492
04:05:38,450 --> 04:05:40,559
Hello

1493
04:05:40,559 --> 04:05:42,559
Wait hell

1494
04:05:43,170 --> 04:05:45,889
You can't say hell in from software games hell

1495
04:05:47,420 --> 04:05:52,579
Wow, there's no reason to take it seriously, but it's fun

1496
04:05:53,219 --> 04:05:59,409
Okay

1497
04:05:59,409 --> 04:06:03,329
Do you think that from software pvp would be more interesting to you?

1498
04:06:04,510 --> 04:06:06,719
if

1499
04:06:06,719 --> 04:06:08,719
You could not use

1500
04:06:09,120 --> 04:06:11,090
any

1501
04:06:11,090 --> 04:06:18,209
Like outrageous weapon arts. What if there were no weapon arts? Would you think it was if there were no weapon arts?

1502
04:06:18,370 --> 04:06:29,299
Would it be better or would it be boring? It would be boring. That's interesting

1503
04:06:29,940 --> 04:06:36,379
That's the fun part

1504
04:06:36,379 --> 04:06:41,700
But then what how come there's um

1505
04:06:41,940 --> 04:06:44,819
This game is these games are so popular. Oh, we couldn't get you. Sorry

1506
04:06:45,459 --> 04:06:47,540
We try to get you

1507
04:06:47,540 --> 04:06:49,219
unknown

1508
04:06:49,219 --> 04:06:54,350
none

1509
04:06:54,350 --> 04:07:01,760
Seems like this is gonna be a tough fight

1510
04:07:01,760 --> 04:07:04,079
um

1511
04:07:04,079 --> 04:07:05,809
How did people

1512
04:07:05,809 --> 04:07:09,969
Can you connect real land and play elden ring like is it possible?

1513
04:07:10,610 --> 04:07:17,309
Did you even do that?

1514
04:07:17,309 --> 04:07:22,420
No, but if you were on the same, okay

1515
04:07:22,500 --> 04:07:24,500
If you did no cross region

1516
04:07:24,500 --> 04:07:30,180
And you were playing from the same room on the same kind of like us west or whatever. Would it be fine?

1517
04:07:31,219 --> 04:07:32,659
the same router

1518
04:07:32,659 --> 04:07:39,870
Get to it. Here we go. All your clothes are off now

1519
04:07:41,219 --> 04:07:43,299
I don't know. I don't know what this person's doing. They're freaking me out though

1520
04:07:43,940 --> 04:07:45,940
They had a full costume on now. They're naked

1521
04:08:03,540 --> 04:08:04,899
Holy shit

1522
04:08:04,899 --> 04:08:28,639
Why did I almost kill you?

1523
04:08:28,639 --> 04:08:30,559
What was what was with the naked?

1524
04:08:30,559 --> 04:08:38,110
Was that to have more than

1525
04:08:38,430 --> 04:08:40,430
What was it? It was funny

1526
04:08:40,590 --> 04:08:46,049
It's a min max build

1527
04:08:46,049 --> 04:08:49,090
They were trying to flex on you. It was an ego boost

1528
04:08:50,370 --> 04:08:57,840
Well, you know, they almost did it. So it's a I it's probably more a reason

1529
04:08:58,719 --> 04:09:00,719
I think we already fought shpee

1530
04:09:02,719 --> 04:09:04,719
gravity plus fall guy

1531
04:09:09,840 --> 04:09:10,959
I'm interested

1532
04:09:10,959 --> 04:09:21,440
Does that mean you're just gonna walk off the edge?

1533
04:09:21,440 --> 04:09:23,440
You're gonna hate to see you fans

1534
04:09:23,440 --> 04:09:24,479
Hey

1535
04:09:24,479 --> 04:09:29,069
What are you talking about? I got it's i'm cross region right now

1536
04:09:29,790 --> 04:10:25,629
So what does gravity plus fall joke mean? I wonder if he was in his equipment menu

1537
04:10:28,579 --> 04:10:30,180
I don't think so

1538
04:10:30,180 --> 04:10:31,299
What do you wait?

1539
04:10:31,299 --> 04:10:36,239
That was

1540
04:10:36,239 --> 04:10:38,399
He was no way was he in an equipment menu?

1541
04:10:38,959 --> 04:10:45,790
Maybe he realized that he was like, oh he's this guy's using the stupid ass bullshit. This guy's doing red as mastery

1542
04:10:46,510 --> 04:10:48,750
What a chump. All right. Well, i'm gonna put a different weapon on

1543
04:10:56,030 --> 04:10:58,030
You beat him up before he could do the joke

1544
04:10:58,899 --> 04:11:00,899
I think I think there was ample time

1545
04:11:04,110 --> 04:11:13,520
There was time

1546
04:11:13,520 --> 04:11:15,680
Let him do the joke

1547
04:11:15,680 --> 04:11:18,959
I I held the router's mastery for a long time and then I fired it

1548
04:11:19,840 --> 04:11:24,379
That wasn't a bad fight. Whatever he was in the equipment. I've done that before

1549
04:11:26,750 --> 04:11:40,510
cool

1550
04:11:40,510 --> 04:11:59,440
What the fuck

1551
04:11:59,440 --> 04:12:02,370
You're gonna do it again, aren't you? I gotta be ready

1552
04:12:11,889 --> 04:12:23,790
This is a sheep

1553
04:12:23,790 --> 04:12:27,579
Oh that hurt

1554
04:12:27,579 --> 04:13:06,159
I didn't even know that moves in the game. That's crazy. Good fight. That was actually pretty interesting bill

1555
04:13:11,629 --> 04:13:13,629
So you drink, uh

1556
04:13:13,950 --> 04:13:15,469
the stamina

1557
04:13:15,469 --> 04:13:21,950
Blast and you can just roll for like a minute. All right should be

1558
04:13:25,920 --> 04:13:36,860
augustin augustine sure. It's a weapon art for what weapon?

1559
04:13:54,059 --> 04:13:56,639
Literally roll so I didn't want to talk because I didn't want to burp

1560
04:13:57,760 --> 04:14:11,309
Let's do it. What the hell?

1561
04:14:11,629 --> 04:14:14,700
Why do they just blow up?

1562
04:14:14,700 --> 04:14:24,159
Holy shit, that move is actually kind of ridiculous

1563
04:14:25,040 --> 04:14:37,520
Oh good move

1564
04:14:37,520 --> 04:14:46,030
That's that move is broken pvp

1565
04:14:46,989 --> 04:14:52,420
Like you can't dodge it it just glues to you

1566
04:14:53,139 --> 04:14:59,729
That was a good fight though. I don't think you can dodge that

1567
04:15:00,530 --> 04:15:05,739
Can you dodge these?

1568
04:15:05,739 --> 04:15:13,440
That move is kind of broken. You have to roll it. You have to dodge it, huh?

1569
04:15:15,469 --> 04:15:17,469
Stars of ruin are a better version. Let me see

1570
04:15:18,110 --> 04:15:34,770
Do I have stars of ruin don't what about founding rain of stars?

1571
04:15:35,809 --> 04:15:37,809
These moves are useless. What the hell am I going to do with these?

1572
04:15:38,690 --> 04:15:40,690
Let me try founding rain of stars. I feel like that'd be weird

1573
04:15:42,270 --> 04:15:43,790
and

1574
04:15:44,110 --> 04:15:46,989
The arc onto

1575
04:15:46,989 --> 04:15:48,270
Get rid of this

1576
04:15:48,270 --> 04:15:51,489
Let's do the gravity pull

1577
04:15:51,489 --> 04:15:56,860
From selen's quest line. Okay. I wonder how this works. I feel like this is gonna be really annoying to deal with

1578
04:15:58,059 --> 04:16:01,920
All right bird brain my computer crashed when I tried to summon you last time. That's kind of scary

1579
04:16:03,120 --> 04:16:06,479
Bloody crow. Let's try it again bird brain. I hope you don't crash my computer again

1580
04:16:06,959 --> 04:16:10,399
Because i'm gonna fight you. I actually I really want to fight you. Don't crash my computer, please

1581
04:16:11,790 --> 04:16:20,940
please

1582
04:16:20,940 --> 04:16:32,819
We're good. We're good

1583
04:16:32,819 --> 04:16:54,579
You know what happened by now?

1584
04:16:54,579 --> 04:16:59,700
They probably crashed

1585
04:16:59,700 --> 04:17:03,940
But bird brain, i'm really sorry. It's the world does not want us to play against each other in elven ring

1586
04:17:06,030 --> 04:17:09,340
Yeah

1587
04:17:09,340 --> 04:17:11,260
I'm sorry. I think you crashed

1588
04:17:11,260 --> 04:17:14,940
I just our computers can't interact with each other. I might jump

1589
04:17:15,979 --> 04:17:22,190
Okay, like off the balcony or

1590
04:17:22,750 --> 04:17:27,299
What does that mean?

1591
04:17:27,299 --> 04:17:29,860
Who is this ghost guy that keeps running? I don't know man

1592
04:17:43,420 --> 04:17:45,260
All right, I might jump

1593
04:17:45,260 --> 04:17:53,809
You will jump

1594
04:17:53,809 --> 04:17:59,409
Hello. Sorry. I was like afk putting on a lip bomb

1595
04:18:00,049 --> 04:18:15,569
Shit I didn't get it

1596
04:18:15,569 --> 04:18:17,569
Actually pretty good. It's a ton of denial

1597
04:18:19,739 --> 04:18:21,739
Bat roll, that's not good

1598
04:18:22,799 --> 04:18:26,879
Oh shit. Oh, no bat roll. Must have maybe an equipment issue

1599
04:18:29,579 --> 04:18:34,639
damn

1600
04:18:34,639 --> 04:18:39,620
Okay. Good game. They only jump

1601
04:18:42,000 --> 04:18:44,370
Oh, I get it

1602
04:18:44,370 --> 04:18:48,370
Right. Okay

1603
04:18:48,370 --> 04:18:51,840
That makes sense now that I think about it. Okay

1604
04:18:53,860 --> 04:19:02,239
Uh, sure bloody crow

1605
04:19:02,319 --> 04:19:04,319
They're audio issues. This shouldn't be

1606
04:19:04,479 --> 04:19:13,309
Maybe one of the good when the crash happens screwed up nice grip

1607
04:19:16,100 --> 04:19:21,219
It's okay, it's kind of a disney movie comic relief character

1608
04:19:51,950 --> 04:19:53,950
Oh got into the magic brain

1609
04:20:00,370 --> 04:20:02,370
Holy shit, what's happening? I just exploded

1610
04:20:04,819 --> 04:20:06,020
Whoa

1611
04:20:06,020 --> 04:20:11,809
This exploded

1612
04:20:11,809 --> 04:20:13,809
This you're a little late on the snap though

1613
04:20:15,260 --> 04:20:24,000
You were a little late. I was already disappeared. You had to get it after this last hit boom

1614
04:20:25,090 --> 04:20:27,250
Because otherwise i'm already gone

1615
04:20:27,809 --> 04:20:35,440
That was a really cool move though

1616
04:20:35,440 --> 04:20:42,819
No, good game. Good game

1617
04:20:42,819 --> 04:20:52,860
Uh, who's next?

1618
04:20:52,860 --> 04:20:58,750
I was the other guys

1619
04:20:58,750 --> 04:21:00,750
I don't contextually. I don't know what that means

1620
04:21:01,389 --> 04:21:03,389
I was the other guy

1621
04:21:07,260 --> 04:21:21,459
Who else from the top rope? He's got the joker makeup on

1622
04:21:23,680 --> 04:21:31,360
perfect

1623
04:21:31,360 --> 04:21:33,360
Uh, bounding rain of stars is actually really good

1624
04:21:34,000 --> 04:21:43,649
It's just irritating

1625
04:21:44,450 --> 04:21:46,129
Put on your um

1626
04:21:46,129 --> 04:21:51,540
No, what do you got? I feel like this is a talent show. All right, what do you got for us?

1627
04:22:17,340 --> 04:22:31,809
Whoa, you don't have a lot of health

1628
04:22:31,809 --> 04:22:33,170
Hit swing

1629
04:22:33,170 --> 04:22:58,579
It'll hit you that move is absolutely broken in pvp. That's the new metal that thing is undodgeable

1630
04:23:04,219 --> 04:23:10,559
It happens so fast

1631
04:23:10,959 --> 04:23:14,750
Dodging that it's I mean like maybe it's just weird

1632
04:23:22,190 --> 04:23:26,190
All right to the next person I summon I apologize. I'm gonna be a total asshole. I just need to experiment

1633
04:23:28,049 --> 04:23:32,129
So i'm really sorry whoever this is. All right. I was the other guy. Sure fine

1634
04:23:32,770 --> 04:23:35,889
I just let you know that i'm gonna i'm gonna be a total uh total dick here

1635
04:23:36,610 --> 04:23:40,129
I'm just curious how this works. I mean if you if you can beat me with this, I mean then

1636
04:23:40,930 --> 04:23:43,569
While I do the kind of annoying cheese experiment

1637
04:23:47,040 --> 04:23:48,239
I could dodge it

1638
04:23:48,239 --> 04:23:54,899
Br josh, where's your sign?

1639
04:23:54,899 --> 04:24:04,350
See it br josh

1640
04:24:04,430 --> 04:24:06,909
It hasn't shown up. Oh, I could give you a password

1641
04:24:09,790 --> 04:24:14,270
All right. I was the other guy. Here's the why are you doing that?

1642
04:24:15,489 --> 04:24:20,610
Why why can you interact with that? I don't understand. Why did you pull this? What was the point of that?

1643
04:24:23,389 --> 04:24:27,809
You can interact the stuff in my world

1644
04:24:27,809 --> 04:24:29,809
All right. Here we go. Ready? Good luck

1645
04:24:42,290 --> 04:25:11,760
Dude, this is I mean honest to god. That's so horrible. That really is annoying especially in the very beginning

1646
04:25:12,559 --> 04:25:17,229
This is too active with non viewers

1647
04:25:19,120 --> 04:25:21,120
Actually, really good try though. That's really irritating

1648
04:25:22,079 --> 04:25:24,559
Yeah, you know, that's that's a really good point. We should go somewhere else

1649
04:25:24,959 --> 04:25:27,520
So we don't like kind of mess up other people's thing going on here

1650
04:25:28,159 --> 04:25:32,030
It's a good point. I want to place it like nobody would be but that's not

1651
04:25:32,750 --> 04:25:42,700
Bad to fight in go to a secret spot

1652
04:25:43,840 --> 04:25:45,600
Yeah, we'll go to um

1653
04:25:45,600 --> 04:25:50,620
What are the?

1654
04:25:50,620 --> 04:25:52,620
Alaketh area. No, there's a lot of people there

1655
04:25:56,059 --> 04:25:58,059
lake of rot underground area

1656
04:25:58,700 --> 04:26:11,899
This might be annoying to get back to volcano manor is good. Yeah, let's do

1657
04:26:12,780 --> 04:26:18,100
What about like right out here?

1658
04:26:18,340 --> 04:26:30,819
This isn't I mean, it's kind of an there's a lot of like

1659
04:26:31,620 --> 04:26:33,620
embers floating around but

1660
04:26:33,620 --> 04:26:36,500
Now that's that's too much. We need we need a gamer. We need to be able to see things

1661
04:26:37,379 --> 04:26:40,190
Turtle church, that's a good place

1662
04:26:41,729 --> 04:26:42,930
Yeah, that's a good one

1663
04:26:42,930 --> 04:26:55,659
Like right here. Yeah pat all the info is on the bottom right right here

1664
04:26:56,559 --> 04:27:01,819
We're inside the church

1665
04:27:01,819 --> 04:27:06,030
Right here. I don't want to do I don't want to accidentally kill the turtle

1666
04:27:06,590 --> 04:27:13,500
You guys are gonna make me founding rain of stars on the turtle and he's gonna die

1667
04:27:14,299 --> 04:27:16,049
All right, right here is good

1668
04:27:16,049 --> 04:27:19,309
Seems pretty open

1669
04:27:19,309 --> 04:27:22,450
Yeah, I'd say right here

1670
04:27:22,450 --> 04:27:24,420

All right. I I don't want to show you guys the password though. So you guys can't see this

1673
04:27:50,139 --> 04:28:08,739
Okay, so there's multiplayer password and then there's a group password

1674
04:28:09,780 --> 04:28:24,399
Can I should I just change them both or keep keep one? How does it work? Is it just okay?

1675
04:28:24,959 --> 04:28:29,700

1697
04:31:06,750 --> 04:31:08,659

I mean that was a fight, but that wasn't a real fight. Now. This is actually going to be the real one

1705
04:32:03,360 --> 04:32:12,850
Sometimes takes a second

1706
04:32:12,850 --> 04:32:14,850
No refunds. I mean you bet

04:34:56,110 --> 04:34:58,349
That was close

1721
04:34:59,500 --> 04:35:05,819
What is this build you've got frost poison and rot what is or blood that was that's insane

1722
04:35:06,619 --> 04:35:19,250
That's actually a really cool build. All right, two out of three. It's two out of three josh

1723
04:35:19,970 --> 04:35:23,279
You know how it works

1724
04:35:23,279 --> 04:35:45,380
That counts as one

1725
04:35:45,380 --> 04:35:48,099
It's really yeah, it's a really cool build. Oh my gosh

1726
04:35:54,400 --> 04:35:55,360
No

1727
04:35:55,360 --> 04:36:18,750
Vr josh, why did you hack me? Oh my whole computer might be going down here same spot. I'll be back man

1728
04:36:18,750 --> 04:36:28,740
It really does not like the multiplayer, huh? That's like the third fourth crash of the night

1729
04:36:29,299 --> 04:36:45,150
All from multiplayer. I somehow got sent to your world too. Well, don't mess anything up

1730
04:36:46,459 --> 04:36:49,580
Don't don't take my peaches. Don't dig holes everywhere

1731
04:36:50,750 --> 04:37:10,430
I'll get out of there. I'll get out of there. I don't want you there. Yeah. Okay

1732
04:37:10,669 --> 04:37:18,270
Yeah, I mean other mods in that that I put it in the mod chat

1733
04:37:18,990 --> 04:37:20,990
other I mean if any of the mods

1734
04:37:21,470 --> 04:37:23,900
Are watching you want to just I could summon you

1735
04:37:24,540 --> 04:37:41,069
Give me a second. I could put it in the other chat too

1736
04:37:41,709 --> 04:37:53,619
You need to watermark the stream already

1737
04:37:54,750 --> 04:37:56,750
Yeah, but I mean it's like I'm

1738
04:37:57,659 --> 04:37:59,419
I will I promise

1739
04:37:59,419 --> 04:38:02,770
So we're still best two out of three

1740
04:38:02,770 --> 04:38:11,279
Let's see if we can get this work

1741
04:38:11,279 --> 04:38:13,439
New there is currently a new password while I

1742
04:38:14,159 --> 04:38:16,619
I've got a little thing going on here with vr josh

1743
04:38:18,819 --> 04:38:23,060
There is a paragraph over here in mod chat from vr josh like just fucking pissed

1744
04:38:23,860 --> 04:38:25,599
There's a ton of spelling errors

1745
04:38:25,599 --> 04:38:30,639
It's like three paragraphs like talking about my build is like shit and i'm like a fucking lazy meme build or something

1746
04:38:31,439 --> 04:38:33,439
That's a lot of words here, man

1747
04:38:53,330 --> 04:38:55,490
All right, so a different approach this time

1748
04:39:00,430 --> 04:39:16,509
That's a fortnight emote, right? It looks like it here we go luck. All right

1749
04:39:36,930 --> 04:39:38,930
Oh fuck, all right, this is bad

1750
04:39:49,759 --> 04:39:52,700
Oh shit

04:40:05,790 --> 04:40:15,569
Erica

1754
04:40:15,569 --> 04:40:17,009

1790
04:47:42,189 --> 04:47:45,250
Been a big fan of watching holly play through this game

1791
04:47:46,049 --> 04:47:48,049
Seeing a lot of her playthrough

1792
04:47:48,450 --> 04:47:54,939

I bet on germa, but I hope holly kills you

1821
04:52:35,139 --> 04:52:41,540
Let me know when I can stop covering my eyes

I hope you beat it. But now the boss has two times as much help

2017
05:16:58,110 --> 05:17:03,250

Oh, i'm, so sorry

Help me with the festival. I have not been able to reach that area

05:17:25,259 --> 05:17:28,939

2026
05:17:42,189 --> 05:17:44,189
It wasn't superman helping people kill people

2027
05:17:45,310 --> 05:17:49,709
Superman, I really don't like this person. Could you like use the laser eyes and vaporize them?

2028
05:17:50,349 --> 05:18:04,930
Summon signs back down. What about your pve spells? I honest. Oh, wait a minute

05:18:14,590 --> 05:18:16,720

2031
05:18:16,720 --> 05:18:25,229

Okay. Yeah

2033
05:18:31,950 --> 05:18:33,950
You're in a trans drama. Okay

2034
05:18:34,270 --> 05:18:36,259
Let's go

2035
05:18:36,259 --> 05:18:38,259
You ready? Is this the same person?

2036
05:18:39,709 --> 05:18:44,430
Are you guys ready?

2037
05:18:44,430 --> 05:18:55,860
Don't invade anybody, please. Can you avoid this attack?

2038
05:19:01,229 --> 05:19:03,229
I don't think I can you can't avoid this, right?

2039
05:19:03,950 --> 05:19:12,560
How do you avoid that lag back leg back leg back leg back leg?

2040
05:19:13,360 --> 05:19:48,959
Easy easy easy. Watch it. Oh my god. I'm I'm the one that had to watch it. Did you?

2041
05:19:52,240 --> 05:20:20,419
I don't think I was even hitting them that place to be right now. I don't know. There's an edge nice work

2042
05:20:21,459 --> 05:20:26,189
Boss holy shit. Okay

2043
05:20:26,430 --> 05:20:27,950
What the fuck

2044
05:20:27,950 --> 05:20:30,110
All right, you can handle it. You can handle it from here. You can handle it from here

2045
05:20:30,909 --> 05:20:38,299
I don't know why this keeps happening. Why does it keep happening?

2046
05:20:42,750 --> 05:20:45,310
Does their game keep going because I mean that you're at phase two

2047
05:20:45,950 --> 05:20:53,580
Are you telling me with commander neil commander neil?

2048
05:20:57,740 --> 05:21:00,779
Maybe just find another. Yeah, I don't know what that that's unfortunate. I'm sorry everybody

2049
05:21:02,400 --> 05:21:07,619
We'll go. Uh, we'll go somewhere else. I did say somebody wanted me to help with godric. Let me do that

2050
05:21:09,520 --> 05:21:11,520
I'm just accidentally griefing people

2051
05:21:11,680 --> 05:21:24,220
Fire giant has notoriously shitty netcode. Oh, that's unfortunate. All right, let me help this person with godric

2052
05:21:24,860 --> 05:21:37,759
I need help with neil as well

2053
05:21:37,759 --> 05:21:40,639
It seems like a lot of people are having trouble with neil

2054
05:21:41,569 --> 05:21:50,130
After godric i'll come up to neil

2055
05:21:50,130 --> 05:21:53,090
Uh millenia is gonna be tough because I feel like i'm gonna make that harder for everybody

2056
05:21:53,729 --> 05:21:57,459
It's the anti-cheat. That's wreck wrecking havoc

2057
05:22:01,790 --> 05:22:04,110
They said godfrey. I know somebody said godric

2058
05:22:04,590 --> 05:22:08,930
Somebody said godfrey, but somebody said godric a long time ago. They've probably been sitting here waiting for it

2059
05:22:09,409 --> 05:22:16,020
How could I make that a fight harder when you get summoned the boss gets more?

2060
05:22:16,979 --> 05:22:21,500
Health so if you die if I get killed by water, uh dance

2061
05:22:22,459 --> 05:22:25,150
In the first 15 seconds

2062
05:22:25,659 --> 05:22:29,900
The boss does not reduce their hp. They stay at like times two hp 50. Yeah

2063
05:22:30,380 --> 05:22:35,819
So if you go in if you let's say you play with your friend and you're both trying to kill, uh, millenia really badly

2064
05:22:36,299 --> 05:22:37,979
You summon your friend

2065
05:22:37,979 --> 05:22:41,979
Millenia has 50 more hp your friend dies. You're still in the game

2066
05:22:42,860 --> 05:22:46,610
You just made it 50 harder for you. What's the password 12 piece?

2067
05:22:56,770 --> 05:23:05,250
What why what's going on here respect to the?

2068
05:23:06,380 --> 05:23:10,700
Raya npc mod use all power consumables and launch out the comet azura at every bus

2069
05:23:14,580 --> 05:23:17,459
That's actually true. I could yeah, but that's kind of just like cheating, right?

2070
05:23:18,180 --> 05:23:25,419
Oh, you can't walk into the okay. Can't walk into the bus room

2071
05:23:28,659 --> 05:23:31,540
12 piece i'm going to godfrey after this

2072
05:23:59,819 --> 05:24:01,819
Does nobody actually need this?

2073
05:24:02,220 --> 05:24:20,720
If you're here and you need this to be done multiplayer use a furl calling finger remedy

2074
05:24:21,040 --> 05:24:24,770
You should see my make sure your password is set. It's also in that menu up in the top, right?

2075
05:24:25,409 --> 05:24:34,959

Okay, here it is

2138
05:33:24,500 --> 05:33:46,750
You really need help with godfrey. You're just going through so much trouble. All he wants to do is help a noob in need

2139
05:33:47,729 --> 05:33:52,880

05:33:59,340 --> 05:34:11,439
Why not ready to do this?

2143
05:34:11,439 --> 05:34:15,919
All right. Uh, just keep in mind that when the boss gets down to like 30 hp i'm going to disconnect apparently

2144
05:34:16,560 --> 05:34:18,939
So let's go

2145
05:34:18,939 --> 05:34:53,060
If you can handle it after it gets to that part

2146
05:34:54,319 --> 05:35:05,619

2154
05:36:49,020 --> 05:36:51,020
That guy definitely killed the boss

2155
05:36:55,680 --> 05:36:56,819

2213
05:47:51,700 --> 05:47:54,979
Playing this game with two people against a boss. It feels weird

Like i'm trying to fight it but like my brain is like no, it's i'm not fighting this

05:48:05,319 --> 05:48:08,439
And sometimes they'll do like a combo where he's like one two and then he's like

05:48:09,080 --> 05:48:11,080
You and he just comes he just comes for you

Now, you know what? It feels like how to be the boys

2218
05:48:14,630 --> 05:48:31,520
Uh, that's all right. Use your spells. I want to do moon veil. How come you're griefing your fans?

2239
05:50:52,819 --> 05:50:55,220
All right, i'm gonna put it down again because there are people that need this

2240
05:50:56,259 --> 05:50:59,880

2241
05:50:59,880 --> 05:51:04,279
Uh, I I hate that boss. I'm probably gonna it's i'm gonna be way worse

2242
05:51:05,970 --> 05:51:10,209
You do not want me to help you do elden beast. I'll get like i'll rage and like turn my stream off

2243
05:51:22,000 --> 05:51:24,259
All right malden

2244
05:51:24,259 --> 05:51:26,259
Let's get it this time. Let's go for it

2245
05:51:28,419 --> 05:51:36,360
No, don't apologize. That's my fault. I'm giving i'm making the boss have 50 more health and ditching you at phase two

2246
05:51:37,000 --> 05:52:13,279
That's not you. That's me

2247
05:52:13,279 --> 05:52:51,750
Oh shit got him too close

2248
05:52:51,750 --> 05:52:55,540
Shit. Oh, he did it twice. Okay, we're good

2249
05:53:10,520 --> 05:53:11,560
It's all right

2250
05:53:11,560 --> 05:53:37,799
No, you gotta get out get out get out. Don't say it

2251
05:53:49,509 --> 05:53:52,709
I'm dead. I'm dead. You got it. You got it. You got this. You got this. He's got these. He's low

2252
05:53:52,709 --> 05:53:55,990
He's low. He's low. He's low. You got it right now. You got this you can do it

2253
05:53:57,880 --> 05:54:04,400
Be careful

2254
05:54:04,400 --> 05:54:09,540
You're so close. You can do it bro. You had two heals

2255
05:54:10,259 --> 05:54:11,240
What?

2256
05:54:11,240 --> 05:54:15,000
I had all right. I gotta get these fucking mana flasks out of here, by the way

2257
05:54:15,479 --> 05:54:17,479
This is stupid

2258
05:54:17,860 --> 05:54:28,099
All right. We need to confirm that he did it

2259
05:54:28,099 --> 05:54:31,139
Why do I have why am I why do I have seven mana?

2260
05:54:32,959 --> 05:54:35,759
Bro, I need one fucking mana flask. I need one

2261
05:54:36,400 --> 05:54:37,439
one

2262
05:54:37,439 --> 05:54:48,200
Did you get it confirmation did malden beat the boss?

2263
05:54:48,759 --> 05:55:07,009
He didn't I need two or it'll be zero. Oh my god

2264
05:55:08,470 --> 05:55:11,349
We didn't beat the boss. Oh, no, i'm so sorry. I

2265
05:55:12,470 --> 05:55:15,590
I come in here with three heels like an idiot

2266
05:55:25,459 --> 05:55:27,459
You did this it's all right. We'll get it right here

2267
05:55:40,740 --> 05:55:54,130
We'll get it. We'll get it the aggro talisman. I feel like that's gonna be worse

2268
05:55:54,689 --> 05:55:58,610
We'll find out

2269
05:55:58,610 --> 05:56:11,779
This is a bad idea. We got it. This is the one

2270
05:56:13,700 --> 05:56:16,180
Yeah, all right. We got ira and we also have malden as well

2271
05:56:16,819 --> 05:56:21,970
By the way, i'm not even using this so I need to put on

2272
05:56:22,849 --> 05:56:36,680
Let's go in case I want to cast a spell for some reason. Let's go

2273
05:56:37,319 --> 05:57:19,159
Really? Oh my god, I died

2274
05:57:47,919 --> 05:57:49,919
No phase two. What the hell is going on? All right

2275
05:57:50,319 --> 05:57:54,930
Let's go

2276
05:57:54,930 --> 05:58:12,040
Fuck you

2277
05:58:12,040 --> 05:58:14,040
God damn it. I'm so bad at that part

2278
05:58:14,520 --> 05:58:47,009
Got it. Nice job

2279
05:58:47,009 --> 05:58:48,209
nice work

2280
05:58:48,209 --> 05:58:59,029
A man of my word dual moon veil. Yeah, that's all good

2281
05:59:02,400 --> 05:59:05,119
All right. I got malden. I gotta take care of malden. That was

2282
05:59:12,290 --> 05:59:14,290
When you tried to summon me you crashed my game

2283
05:59:14,770 --> 05:59:16,770
and it seems to be a kind of a

2284
05:59:17,680 --> 05:59:23,990
Thing that happens. All right

2285
05:59:23,990 --> 05:59:25,430
All right malden, let's go

2286
05:59:25,430 --> 05:59:38,520
Where you at and then we'll go to commander neil after this. I gotta get this win for malden though. That's not that's not cool

2287
05:59:44,770 --> 06:00:00,639
This is so fun

2288
06:00:00,639 --> 06:00:05,080
Got it on the ground here. Hopefully malden didn't uh, didn't rage quit or something

2289
06:00:05,560 --> 06:00:12,610
That'd be sad. There we go. I've been doing nothing but co-op bosses since beating the game

2290
06:00:13,169 --> 06:00:15,860
It's it it definitely feels a lot different

2291
06:00:17,639 --> 06:00:20,200
It's like when you have a summon out but the summons there the whole time

2292
06:00:20,840 --> 06:00:23,299
It's really cool

2293
06:00:23,299 --> 06:00:25,299
What do you uh, yeah, we're doing dos

2294
06:00:26,099 --> 06:00:43,159
This is different. This is a different player. Okay snaggle tooth. Let's do it up with elden beast

2295
06:00:45,319 --> 06:00:48,520
We'll do um, I want to do a lot of people what we're talking about neil

2296
06:00:50,279 --> 06:01:21,880
Far away get a stagger. Come on

2297
06:01:22,439 --> 06:01:54,759
There it is

2298
06:01:55,080 --> 06:02:18,630
Phase two. Yeah, there we go. Got it bro. What happened? How did that happen? That was so weird

2299
06:02:20,680 --> 06:02:25,330
No

2300
06:02:25,330 --> 06:02:35,250
Animation continued and happened in phase two because we caught it right. That's unfair

2301
06:02:36,790 --> 06:02:48,240
That's unfair. That was unfair

2302
06:02:52,389 --> 06:02:55,110
All right, last last attempt on whatever on whoever gets it

2303
06:02:55,349 --> 06:03:02,549
Hopefully, uh, i'd love to do with malden and then we're gonna go to commander neil. You look really greasy. I know it's I am

2304
06:03:03,799 --> 06:03:19,759
Do you understand like I am like i'm a greasy fucking person. Okay, cool

2305
06:03:20,319 --> 06:03:21,200
oh

2306
06:03:21,200 --> 06:03:23,139
Stretch it out a little

2307
06:03:23,139 --> 06:03:29,430
All right, somebody else. I apologize to people that I couldn't beat it

2308
06:03:30,069 --> 06:03:32,759
It's my bad, but hopefully we get this one

2309
06:03:34,580 --> 06:04:13,250
That's so like loud. We're a stagger here

2310
06:04:13,810 --> 06:04:18,360
Can't see anything

2311
06:04:22,099 --> 06:05:14,439
It pulls it up right

2312
06:05:19,759 --> 06:05:20,880
Careful

2313
06:05:20,880 --> 06:05:44,549
He's dead. Oh

2314
06:05:44,630 --> 06:05:46,880
Boy

2315
06:05:46,880 --> 06:05:49,040
You gotta we gotta get him one more hit on him and he's dead

2316
06:05:49,759 --> 06:06:06,639
Let's go excellent work

2317
06:06:07,720 --> 06:06:13,169
Get it

2318
06:06:13,169 --> 06:06:14,979
This feels good

2319
06:06:14,979 --> 06:06:19,139
It doesn't feel good when you die in the first 10 seconds and you know that they have to just leave the room

2320
06:06:19,779 --> 06:06:23,750
Did malden do it? I don't think so

2321
06:06:23,830 --> 06:06:28,560
Despite you being bad at the game and dying. I enjoyed coping with you

2322
06:06:31,040 --> 06:06:37,860
Malden you can we get a mod confirmation of malden is still here. I tried helping malden and I died

2323
06:06:39,970 --> 06:06:41,860
No

2324
06:06:41,860 --> 06:06:46,919
Malden just can't malden can't catch a break. This is something it sucks. All right malden

2325
06:06:48,500 --> 06:06:51,459
Mods can we get a private password for malden, please?

2326
06:06:59,919 --> 06:07:06,040
Yeah, let's get up. Let's get a special password for malden. Who is malden?

2327
06:07:07,090 --> 06:07:12,639
Uh, he's a player and I lost twice

2328
06:07:13,520 --> 06:07:15,680
Well, we got him down to one hit

2329
06:07:16,319 --> 06:07:31,569
It's too bad. We'll get it. I'll make sure malden gets a uh gets the win here. He's the main character

2330
06:07:32,369 --> 06:07:35,759
Hopefully malden's here

2331
06:07:35,759 --> 06:07:37,759
Malden might not even actually be here

2332
06:07:38,240 --> 06:07:40,240
They might just be playing the game not even watching the stream

2333
06:07:40,799 --> 06:07:43,430
Oh, no, that's impossible because the password

2334
06:07:48,020 --> 06:07:49,060
anything

2335
06:07:49,060 --> 06:07:53,639
About 10 more seconds and then we're gonna go to uh, neil

2336
06:07:57,000 --> 06:08:06,080
Sorry, man

2337
06:08:06,799 --> 06:08:22,529
Let's go to uh commander neil first commander neil. Oh, we got malden. All right. Yeah, we do have malden

2338
06:08:22,529 --> 06:08:28,869

2339
06:08:31,299 --> 06:08:51,000

2340
06:08:53,889 --> 06:09:21,520
Uh, I just will use this password password confirmed

2341
06:09:22,159 --> 06:09:24,720
Let me get the sign on the ground

2342
06:09:25,200 --> 06:09:56,310
Go fucking around this time. I'm out. I'm gonna go for it. I'm gonna win. I'm not doing elden beast

2343
06:09:56,389 --> 06:10:00,520
No way the password mcchicken is not

2344
06:10:02,419 --> 06:10:10,130
All right, uh malden is confirmed

2345
06:10:11,250 --> 06:10:12,689
Got the password

2346
06:10:12,770 --> 06:10:19,040
This time I have a healing flask

2347
06:10:19,200 --> 06:10:34,240
Do I have the password right? Let me make sure I do

2348
06:10:36,400 --> 06:10:54,450
Yeah, there we go. Okay. There we go. Order one mcchicken every time you die actually

2349
06:10:55,250 --> 06:10:57,810
Maybe I will get some mcdonald's later. I don't know

2350
06:11:01,360 --> 06:11:04,900
Oh, dude, we got it. We're going with the double here

2351
06:11:07,720 --> 06:11:17,090
Please help. All right. Well, then we'll take care of you and summon up some of the actual summon at the door, too

2352
06:11:17,250 --> 06:11:19,250

Let's go

06:11:51,080 --> 06:11:53,080
I can't even tell what's happening

2356
06:11:53,919 --> 06:11:55,119
We're gonna die

2357
06:11:55,119 --> 06:12:01,970
There's too much going on

2358
06:12:01,970 --> 06:12:03,090
god

2359
06:12:03,090 --> 06:12:23,939
Is that still gonna land?

2360
06:12:25,360 --> 06:12:27,599
Did I do it? Oh, no, it was malden. All right, we're good

2361
06:12:28,319 --> 06:12:37,439
We did it. We did it

2362
06:12:37,439 --> 06:12:38,639
Yes

2363
06:12:38,639 --> 06:12:43,909

Here's the best part. I can leave you guys

With that password that you guys could that password can stay

2373

You guys can help each other, right?

2374
06:13:42,630 --> 06:13:44,549
Just use that same password

2375
06:13:44,549 --> 06:13:55,490
All right. This is the room. All right, so it's time

2376

All right, whoever needed help with that commander nail. I'm here right here neil or

2377
06:14:09,330 --> 06:14:12,689
O'neil

2378
06:14:12,689 --> 06:14:14,689
These people are idiots. Don't leave me

2379
06:14:15,009 --> 06:14:17,759
All right boogers just came out my nose. I think i'm i'm ruined

2380
06:14:21,080 --> 06:14:22,599
Oh the password

2381
06:14:22,599 --> 06:14:27,169
It is different password is no longer yo malden

2382
06:14:28,479 --> 06:14:38,069
It's now we'll go back to cheese doctor. That's better same when we had at the very beginning

2383
06:14:38,709 --> 06:14:57,200
Let's do some commander new

2384
06:14:57,200 --> 06:15:00,000
Although actually I no, that's fine. It's fine

2385
06:15:01,360 --> 06:15:15,860
Cheese doctor or cheese drive. I mean it's supposed to be cheese doctor, but I couldn't fit anything else

2386
06:15:16,500 --> 06:15:28,419
If you're just joining the stream if you'd be I don't usually use the moon veil

2387
06:15:29,299 --> 06:15:57,700
It's a good helper weapon

2388
06:15:57,939 --> 06:17:05,779
Is nobody here?

2389
06:17:05,779 --> 06:17:15,970
How have I not been summoned yet?

2390
06:17:15,970 --> 06:17:17,330
Do a diagonal

2391
06:17:17,330 --> 06:17:19,669
How do I do that? I know obvious

2392
06:17:19,669 --> 06:17:24,849
Can I even can I make a diagonal?

2393
06:17:40,479 --> 06:17:42,479
Rewrite the summon sign. Oh shit

2394
06:17:43,680 --> 06:17:53,299
I want to make a diagonal. I don't think I can make a diagonal

2395
06:17:54,400 --> 06:17:56,000
Transform hold on

2396
06:17:56,000 --> 06:17:59,349
No, you can't

2397
06:17:59,349 --> 06:18:27,430
Make it smaller

2398
06:18:27,590 --> 06:18:48,450
Hold on. I gotta add one more thing

2399
06:19:24,360 --> 06:19:26,360
Oh, right. It's you

2400
06:19:30,740 --> 06:19:32,740
I should put like sounds in the background too like

2401
06:19:34,959 --> 06:19:59,720
Um, okay, so where are we going from here? Oh fuck the wrong weapons wrong weapons

2402
06:20:01,779 --> 06:20:25,090
That's so fucking annoying. I hate that. I don't want to do it anymore. All right, get up

2403
06:20:43,639 --> 06:20:45,080
Oh shit

2404
06:20:45,080 --> 06:21:05,759
Oh shit

2405
06:21:05,759 --> 06:21:07,860
Oh

2406
06:21:07,860 --> 06:21:08,900
Oh

2407
06:21:08,900 --> 06:21:11,590
I'm in the corner

2408
06:21:16,419 --> 06:21:53,040
Careful back it up. We got it. I forgot. This is all on here

2409
06:22:00,029 --> 06:22:20,340
Subscription start at 1499 subscription start at 1499. What the fuck was that?

2410
06:22:20,580 --> 06:22:28,959
It scared the shit out of me. Why did it not play before that actually scared the shit out of me?

2411
06:22:28,959 --> 06:22:38,549
I don't know why it didn't play before. No, fuck that joke. I thought somebody like hacked my game was in my call

2412
06:22:39,270 --> 06:22:47,220
I actually thought that somebody was in a call like hacked my computer or something

2413
06:22:49,939 --> 06:22:51,939
I know for a fact somebody else needed help with this. So

2414
06:22:52,819 --> 06:23:04,790
Why did it take so long? That was weird

2415
06:23:11,380 --> 06:23:18,610
Okay, I know there was another person that needed help with this badly. So come on. Let's do it. There we go

2416
06:23:27,889 --> 06:23:29,889
Help with lord of cinder

2417
06:23:43,909 --> 06:23:45,909
Oh, it's pot friend. Okay

2418
06:23:46,319 --> 06:23:49,599
Well now I know why you need help with this because your character probably sucks

2419
06:23:50,080 --> 06:24:03,779
Who the hell what's going on? Why's my health so low? What's going on?

2420
06:24:15,490 --> 06:24:24,520
Bro, I don't know what you want me to do, man

2421
06:24:25,159 --> 06:24:36,880
You're like you're like level 15. All right, let's do it again

2422
06:24:37,439 --> 06:24:44,200
That way the person was level one. Oh my god, that's stupid

2423
06:24:49,490 --> 06:25:05,330
I was gonna say that something was off about that one. Oh jesus again. Jesus

2424
06:25:06,279 --> 06:25:09,720
All right, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I don't know what he's doing. I don't he's freaking out. He's freaking me out

2425
06:25:09,720 --> 06:25:12,680
He's freaking me out. I don't know what he's doing. He's moving around weird. He's moving around get out get out get out get out

2426
06:25:13,240 --> 06:25:15,240
He's doing weird shit

2427
06:25:15,240 --> 06:25:18,369
All right, that was he's freaking me out. I don't like it

2428
06:25:20,419 --> 06:25:22,419
He was like he was going like this

2429
06:25:23,509 --> 06:25:25,509
That was fucking scary. I don't know what he was doing

2430
06:25:26,069 --> 06:25:37,520
I don't know, dude. I'm sorry. I might be freaking out but when the character's sitting there going like this

2431
06:25:38,080 --> 06:25:42,099
It's like okay

2432
06:25:42,099 --> 06:25:47,060
You're like you're hacking the game or something and like you're about to like throw up like a fucking thousand pixels on the screen

2433
06:25:47,060 --> 06:26:02,080
And my computer's gonna crash

2434
06:26:02,080 --> 06:26:03,919
All right, froggy chair

2435
06:26:03,919 --> 06:26:14,790
What do you say? Let's go for it

2436
06:26:16,840 --> 06:26:55,220
Cool good start. What are you doing? What was that?

2437
06:27:13,159 --> 06:27:14,919
He's exhausted

2438
06:27:14,919 --> 06:27:45,009
That was fucking weird

2439
06:27:45,009 --> 06:28:00,450
Shit, good job. All right, this should be it

2440
06:28:09,990 --> 06:28:32,930
Nice job. All right. So was that the person that really needed the help anybody else need help here where jesus is in chat right now

2441
06:28:33,330 --> 06:28:34,689
What what he what?

2442
06:28:34,689 --> 06:28:39,279
I don't know. You scared me. It was scary. I don't know what was going. I was scary

2443
06:28:40,520 --> 06:28:56,479
You look like a greaser not greasy. Oh, okay. How do you even get the name on twitch?

2444
06:29:02,200 --> 06:29:04,360
real

2445
06:29:04,360 --> 06:29:06,360
real jesus christ

2446
06:29:06,919 --> 06:29:11,119
I feel like I feel like that's gonna get caught by a filter eventually

2447
06:29:18,229 --> 06:29:20,229
That name is just so fucking weird

2448
06:29:21,060 --> 06:29:27,200
All right. Is this jesus? No, it's not

2449
06:29:28,279 --> 06:29:31,459
Whoa, that was kind of scary

2450
06:29:31,459 --> 06:29:33,459
The real jesus christ

2451
06:29:33,700 --> 06:29:42,470
That's so fucking funny

2452
06:29:57,159 --> 06:30:04,639
Good careful for the boss boss is right behind you man

2453
06:30:05,599 --> 06:30:08,290
careful for the boss

2454
06:30:08,529 --> 06:30:24,950
Watch out back it up. You'll be able to stagger here

2455
06:30:36,659 --> 06:31:04,259
Oh, no

2456
06:31:04,259 --> 06:31:16,159
Back it up back it up. You're good. Oh my god. I thought he died. Nice job

2457
06:31:16,479 --> 06:31:23,430
Imagine if the second coming happened during an elden ring stream

2458
06:31:24,150 --> 06:31:44,709
You're gonna play the new lego star wars didn't that like the end game already come out. I'm confused

2459
06:31:45,270 --> 06:31:57,189
Everybody would spam pog

2460
06:31:57,189 --> 06:31:59,830
There's a new one. That's is it better than the old one?

2461
06:32:00,389 --> 06:32:03,560
All right, maybe one more of these

2462
06:32:03,560 --> 06:32:06,520
One more of these and then i'm gonna wrap it up with a little bit of pvp

2463
06:32:11,639 --> 06:32:26,520
Just came up. It's pretty fun

2464
06:32:26,520 --> 06:32:30,200
The actual actual second coming of christ, but he spawned an elden ring

2465
06:32:30,840 --> 06:32:49,540
It includes all the new movies. All right, okay

2466
06:32:50,340 --> 06:32:51,939
That makes sense

2467
06:32:51,939 --> 06:32:54,099
Maybe we did maybe everybody is done with um

2468
06:32:56,119 --> 06:33:03,729
Neil are we good? Did the three or four people that needed did uh, are we good?

2469
06:33:07,119 --> 06:33:10,799
No help with millennia. No, that's not happening. I will ruin all your games

2470
06:33:13,520 --> 06:33:17,360
Okay

2471
06:33:17,360 --> 06:33:19,599
Okay, i'm gonna give it 10 more seconds

2472
06:33:20,159 --> 06:33:21,279
Here we go

2473
06:33:21,279 --> 06:33:28,930
Millennia is easier without help. I would imagine so

2474
06:33:29,569 --> 06:33:34,479
Because if she kills your co-opter and heals off of them, then you just have to deal with a way worse version

2475
06:33:35,439 --> 06:33:37,880
All right, ashley

2476
06:33:37,880 --> 06:33:47,479
cool weapon

2477
06:33:47,479 --> 06:33:49,479
I like the uh giddy and off near stuff

2478
06:33:55,270 --> 06:33:57,810
This boss is dead

2479
06:33:57,810 --> 06:33:59,729
Do you kill this already?

2480
06:33:59,729 --> 06:34:11,270
What are we doing? Where are we going? What are you gonna do?

2481
06:34:13,409 --> 06:34:17,650
Where do you want to go?

2482
06:34:17,650 --> 06:34:20,849
I'm i'm following your lead. Where where where we're going. Let's go

2483
06:34:21,569 --> 06:34:40,470
You didn't have to do that

2484
06:34:40,470 --> 06:34:45,299
You didn't have to do that. We could have just walked around. No, I kind of feel bad

2485
06:34:47,599 --> 06:34:50,240
Well, it was cool to see you for the few seconds that we were there

2486
06:34:50,799 --> 06:34:58,200
It was just a short cameo

2487
06:34:58,200 --> 06:34:59,639
All right, let's go to

2488
06:34:59,639 --> 06:35:02,759
I'm gonna do some pp. I'm gonna do moonvale pvp. I'm gonna be an asshole

2489
06:35:03,400 --> 06:35:07,830
We're gonna pick a spot. This is that we're gonna finish the stream this way

2490
06:35:08,470 --> 06:35:22,740
How about like somewhere in caitlin? We're here somewhere. I guess we could do it here

2491
06:35:24,180 --> 06:35:25,860
I'm not over here by virgin

2492
06:35:25,860 --> 06:35:35,700
Yeah, like right over here

2493
06:35:35,860 --> 06:35:38,020
Password is still cheese doctor. So

2494
06:35:39,060 --> 06:35:41,060
Your sign's down

2495
06:35:41,380 --> 06:35:46,049
We'll do this. I'll do another like three or four

2496
06:35:46,369 --> 06:35:52,520
And then i'm gonna call for today

2497
06:35:52,520 --> 06:35:54,119
Oh, you can't do it here

2498
06:35:54,119 --> 06:35:56,200
And what do you can?

2499
06:35:56,200 --> 06:35:59,700
Is that not I hear is that wrong?

2500
06:36:02,310 --> 06:36:05,250
okay, um, how about

2501
06:36:12,500 --> 06:36:18,319
That church of vows was pretty good spot. Yeah, this was a good spot

2502
06:36:18,880 --> 06:36:29,720
We're outside. We're ever gonna do this again. I don't know. I mean, this is really fun

2503
06:36:30,610 --> 06:36:32,610
You guys want to do this again, I would definitely do it again

2504
06:36:33,090 --> 06:36:45,779
This was a good spot

2505
06:36:45,779 --> 06:36:48,099
All right. We have an uh, we have actual psycho

2506
06:36:49,459 --> 06:36:53,360
I'm gonna do moon veil. I'm curious how it is

2507
06:36:53,759 --> 06:36:58,040
Even it makes me an asshole

2508
06:36:58,040 --> 06:37:06,799
Sorry, what's today? Stay saturday

2509
06:37:13,479 --> 06:37:20,229
Actually might not be able to stream tomorrow. We don't have to do dos on monday. I don't know why I thought it was friday

2510
06:37:20,790 --> 06:37:22,150
I thought it was friday

2511
06:37:22,150 --> 06:37:30,369
Did I?

2512
06:37:30,369 --> 06:37:36,689
Summon somebody I just did all right this barf drinker again. We might uh do a rematch. All right a gamer boy

2513
06:37:37,569 --> 06:37:45,830
Do I have a backup save?

2514
06:37:45,830 --> 06:37:47,830
Um, I think i'm fine. I'm okay

2515
06:37:47,909 --> 06:37:52,040
there's been like one or two hackers, but it was just like kind of I mean it was

2516
06:37:52,680 --> 06:37:54,520
It was pretty funny

2517
06:37:54,520 --> 06:37:56,520
It was just like insanity

2518
06:37:56,840 --> 06:38:05,639
I don't mind people just kind of fucking having fun as long as as long as nobody like actually tries to you know

2519
06:38:05,639 --> 06:38:07,799
Hey break my game or something, but you know

Did we confirm that jesus christ was a hacker? I mean

2522
06:38:18,400 --> 06:38:20,400
in the video game

2523
06:38:20,639 --> 06:38:24,919
That's unbelievable. All right. Okay. All right. All right. I'll take it

2524
06:38:26,200 --> 06:38:31,330
Okay, i'll take it up. I'll take it. It's my

2525
06:38:33,119 --> 06:38:37,759
Oh, hi. Yeah, you can heal by the way. Yeah, that weapon's fucking awful. That weapon's unbelievable

2526
06:38:38,080 --> 06:38:40,240
But good luck dealing with uh, good luck dealing with this

Let's just start just start over just start over start over

2530
06:39:07,779 --> 06:39:09,599

Heal all the way heal all the way. Yeah, there we go. All right, so now we can actually go let's go

Oh, I have my weapons flipped my weapons have flipped let me let me fix my weapon

2534
06:40:10,439 --> 06:40:21,720
I was wondering why because I was the spin actually was pretty that that was doing work

2535
06:40:23,590 --> 06:40:28,450
Uh good game though

2536
06:40:28,529 --> 06:40:40,880
Fucking stupid. All right

2537
06:40:41,360 --> 06:40:43,360
Now i'm ready to pvp

2538
06:40:53,430 --> 06:41:01,090
Done you actually have a gun

2539
06:41:01,090 --> 06:41:03,090

2540
06:41:03,330 --> 06:41:06,520

That thing that means right? Wait, do you think jesus is going like

2544
06:41:26,549 --> 06:41:30,400
Probably I would make it would make sense. All right, how are you? Let's do it

2545
06:41:31,939 --> 06:41:42,049
I weren't ready for the fucking rain of stars

2546
06:41:42,770 --> 06:42:07,090
Where are you going?

2547
06:42:07,090 --> 06:42:09,090
Yo, oh, that was cool. All right

2548
06:42:09,650 --> 06:42:11,590

2549
06:42:11,590 --> 06:42:12,950
damn

2550
06:42:12,950 --> 06:42:14,150
Okay

2551
06:42:14,150 --> 06:42:20,610
That person looks like they had a camera

2552
06:42:20,610 --> 06:42:24,770
They're just snapping pictures of us

2553
06:42:38,159 --> 06:42:45,090
gg. Good game. All right, let's get a good one here

2554
06:42:46,779 --> 06:42:48,000
helicopter

2555
06:42:48,000 --> 06:42:55,250
Kind of need to know and you need to know what the helicopter character looks like

2556
06:42:58,770 --> 06:43:00,770
I think i'm not doing spells. I think it's gonna go just two handed

2557
06:43:01,409 --> 06:43:06,659
This is an exploit

2558
06:43:06,740 --> 06:43:20,229
Whatever. Hey, hello

2559
06:43:20,229 --> 06:44:02,040
Dude, you got nice recovery though. It's gonna be close

2560
06:44:08,099 --> 06:44:09,220

06:44:38,209 --> 06:44:44,069
Physical damage, uh, I think it was magic damage

2569
06:44:46,319 --> 06:44:56,080
Yeah, put it

2570
06:44:56,080 --> 06:44:57,990

2571
06:44:57,990 --> 06:44:59,990
Operator turned into atmosphere

2572
06:45:01,330 --> 06:45:03,939
I'm for it. Let's go

2573
06:45:03,939 --> 06:45:12,439

06:45:27,380 --> 06:45:29,169
How are you?

2576
06:45:29,169 --> 06:45:38,360
That's a weird move

2577
06:45:38,360 --> 06:45:52,709
Whoa

2578
06:45:52,709 --> 06:45:57,619
Holy shit. Nice. Okay mode that that was weird

2579
06:45:58,659 --> 06:46:12,130
There's a little purple thing. Okay. Arian slicer is really good. Don't I have it? Do I like dairy queen?

2580
06:46:12,689 --> 06:46:14,689
It yeah, it's fine. It's good

2581
06:46:32,470 --> 06:46:40,180
Would gigachad have that weapon I feel like gigachad would use like the big hammer

2582
06:46:40,740 --> 06:47:49,729
How are you? Holy shit. Oh my god

2583
06:47:52,240 --> 06:47:54,240
Oh, that was so close. Nice fight

2584
06:47:55,279 --> 06:47:58,400
That move what that move did almost 100% of my health

2585
06:47:58,959 --> 06:48:00,639
That was ridiculous

2586
06:48:00,639 --> 06:48:21,279
That is how much I had left. Good fight. I mean barf drinker has been patiently waiting. All right

2587
06:48:21,520 --> 06:48:29,330
Why do I get so tired all of a sudden? I'm like tired

2588
06:48:29,889 --> 06:48:38,560
I don't know what happened summon code is uh cheese dr cheese doctor cheese

2589
06:48:39,779 --> 06:48:41,779
Cheese drive probably makes more sense. All right

06:48:48,150 --> 06:48:50,470
Going on barf drinker long time no see

2591
06:48:51,189 --> 06:49:15,540

All right. Well now that you dropped our fps by about 20 let's go ahead and fight

2596
06:49:39,889 --> 06:49:43,330
On fire

2597
06:49:43,330 --> 06:50:00,159
I don't know why I feel like i'm fighting an old lady

2598
06:50:00,639 --> 06:50:03,889
Piece of shit

2599
06:50:03,889 --> 06:50:11,680
I feel like i'm fighting an old lady and she's like throwing just random shit in her kitchen or like in her living room

2600
06:50:12,159 --> 06:50:13,680
like she's just like

2603
06:50:20,319 --> 06:50:31,520
Hey grandma, what are you doing up in the attic?

2604
06:50:31,599 --> 06:50:36,000
I'm just like going through some old books and stuff and she's just and she fucking just starts throwing them

2605
06:50:50,360 --> 06:50:53,080
Why are you so it's so weird. It's so weird to fight you

2606
06:50:56,150 --> 06:50:58,470
Is that a bomb? That's a mine, isn't it? This is a mine

2607
06:51:02,020 --> 06:51:05,669
Yo, what is that?

2608
06:51:05,669 --> 06:51:07,669
Grandma, where did you find this in the attic?

2609
06:51:19,700 --> 06:51:26,049
Come here. I want to backstab. I want to backstab grandma to end it

2610
06:51:31,520 --> 06:51:32,880

2618
06:52:29,919 --> 06:52:31,119

06:52:31,119 --> 06:52:35,279
Grandma, we just grandma was like fucking breathing out like a crack pipe at the end

2620
06:52:41,540 --> 06:52:47,060
I was trying to get a backstab. I was trying to go I I could have killed barf drinker

2621
06:52:47,540 --> 06:52:52,020
At any moment at that at any moment, but I was trying to get the backstab. I was trying to be cute with it

2622
06:52:53,060 --> 06:52:55,060
Pretty much what i'm saying is barf drinker put it back down

2623
06:52:56,450 --> 06:52:57,650
You're around too

2624
06:52:57,650 --> 06:53:16,060
I can't believe you died to barf drinker dad of air fryer

2625
06:53:17,020 --> 06:53:25,529
It's pretty that's a pretty good name

2626
06:53:38,650 --> 06:53:40,729
Literally, you don't own one

2627
06:53:40,729 --> 06:53:46,169
I don't own an air fryer

2628
06:53:46,169 --> 06:53:47,689
And I don't think I ever will

2629
06:53:47,689 --> 06:54:15,080
Let's run. It's perfectly fine. Hey, all right dad. Let's do it dad. You got low hp

2630
06:54:15,799 --> 06:54:24,599
Yeah, what level are you just a little uh bigger?

2631
06:54:38,810 --> 06:54:46,380
No air fryer

2632
06:54:46,380 --> 06:54:51,580
By the way, i'm not even sure that guy owns an air fryer because why would you make an air fryer character and not have?

2633
06:54:52,619 --> 06:54:54,380
like heat moves

2634
06:54:54,380 --> 06:54:57,930
Like where's where's the fireballs coming out of your hands and shit?

2635
06:54:58,729 --> 06:55:17,189
All right. Here's uh, ashley that you jumped up the flip before barf drinker part two. Oh, yeah. Well, don't worry

2636
06:55:17,830 --> 06:55:42,470
Let's go for it. Here we go. That weapon is scary looking

2637
06:55:43,430 --> 06:56:00,310
That's a good move actually

2638
06:56:15,060 --> 06:56:17,060
Oh, I caught right in the air

2639
06:56:17,619 --> 06:56:32,139
I'm doing it too. You jumped over it

2640
06:56:36,150 --> 06:56:39,029
All right. Well, I i'll get to drink. I can drink another one because you drank too

2641
06:56:39,990 --> 06:57:12,090
Shit okay if they heal you can heal that's that's the uh, that's the

2642
06:57:14,200 --> 06:57:20,520
If they heal you can heal too, but never don't ever go more than they if they let's let's say somebody drinks two

2643
06:57:21,159 --> 06:57:23,159
Then you can drink two somebody drinks five

2644
06:57:24,180 --> 06:57:26,659
You can drink five if somebody drinks one. You can't drink five

2645
06:57:27,380 --> 06:57:36,619
Now let's get that that weapons. What is that weapon? The weapon is actually really cool. I really like that fucking thing

2646
06:57:37,099 --> 06:57:39,099
But there was no reason to say the f-word

2647
06:57:39,259 --> 06:57:47,099
Why did I just say the f-word

2648
06:57:47,099 --> 06:57:51,180
I've received an air fryer in the mail by mistake. I've kept it, but I never used it

2649
06:57:53,819 --> 06:57:55,819
Is it just in the box?

2650
06:58:01,000 --> 06:58:11,099
That's the gargoyle twin blade. Okay. Yeah, we begin

2651
06:58:23,930 --> 06:58:26,490
Holy shit. What's that? Is that the hammer?

2652
06:58:36,069 --> 06:58:37,750
Oh, man

2653
06:58:37,750 --> 06:58:40,889
I've never seen that before

2654
06:58:40,889 --> 06:58:45,639
That thing's crazy

2655
06:58:45,639 --> 06:58:57,020
But that weapon seems really fun. It's the final boss soul. Uh, right, right, right, right

2656
06:59:00,119 --> 06:59:03,560
All right, let's do uh, i'll do three more. I want my rematch

I mean, maybe I should just summon this guy. This guy's kind of a weirdo

2842
07:22:49,619 --> 07:22:55,849
Maybe all right barf drinker versus whatever. This is a michelin man

You freaked me out. Sorry
