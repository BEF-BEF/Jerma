1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:09,699
Let's ditch him.

2
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:15,300
Those are some big tires you've got there, Jerma.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,440
They're better to see you with. They're better to eat you with, my dear.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Yep, those are all solid objects. Okay, that is two.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Alright, this is where I want to go. I want to get on this because I'm going to turn around.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,439
We're going to get some big air.

7
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:42,539
Alright, what's the proper way to change weapons while inside of a vehicle?

8
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,539
Mouse... No, that's not going to do it.

9
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,539
It's mouse scroll outside of the vehicle.

10
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,539
Not sure what it is inside, though.

11
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,539
Whoa, that cop was flying.

12
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,539
Inside the vehicle it is change radio stations.

13
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,539
Ready for some dukes of hazards?

14
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,539
Let's try and catch the mirror with this little leap.

15
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,539
Oh, we didn't get in the air.

16
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,540
That was the leap back there.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,540
I thought it was the leap, but I guess not.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,709
I guess not, huh?

19
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,709
Switch to the driver's seat.

20
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,069
Okay, maybe not.

21
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,780
I probably would have been better off just sitting in the vehicle.

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,430
I just spawned and you like flew by the screen.

23
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,799
Why did I spawn at the perfect time? That was awesome.

24
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,549
Oh, how surreal.

25
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,980
I flew you out of the car.

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:15,469
I picked up something that looked remotely like statue charges,

27
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,469
and I clicked the button right as you ran into me.

28
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:24,469
So, I can only assume that I successfully planted C4 on your vehicle.

29
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:27,469
You smacked your face on the car.

30
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,360
One of us is going to have a bad day.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,330
A real bad day.

32
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,629
Where's Boo? I see him coming, but I don't see him.

33
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,629
Boo, where you at?

34
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,629
Oh my, police.

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,629
Turn around, Boo.

36
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,629
Alright, let's do it.

37
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:48,629
Watch out for the guy in the Ferrari.

38
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,509
That seriously startled me.

39
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,509
That scared me.

40
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,509
What is blowing up?

41
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,509
What just happened?

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Why are there so many explosions?

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Apparently, I had my grenade launcher out.

44
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:16,889
Where are you guys?

45
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,889
I'm trying to play Ski... Wow.

46
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,889
What?

47
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,889
What did you just do?

48
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm trying to...

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm trying to play Ski Ball.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,389
And this is what you do when you play Ski Ball.

51
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,389
Oopsie daisy.

52
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,919
I can't even like...

53
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,919
Who shot that?

54
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,919
What is going on over there?

55
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,349
I just saw that firsthand.

56
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:50,349
You just crashed into that building.

57
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,349
Yeah, but I landed.

58
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,349
I landed on top of the building.

59
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:58,349
My character flew through the window, safely, on top of the building.

60
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:00,349
That was incredible.

61
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,349
Can I still fly this thing?

62
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,659
Is this thing still able to be flown?

63
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,659
My character is trying to find a way.

64
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,659
Maybe that way.

65
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,219
Just get in, you butt head.

66
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,180
Will you just get in?

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,180
What is he doing?

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,180
He's like so unsure of himself.

69
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,180
I don't know, should I get in?

70
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
I don't think so.

71
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,060
No, maybe not.

72
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,540
I get an idea.

73
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
I'm gonna move this thing.

74
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
I'm gonna just ram into it.

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,040
Move.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,430
Get in.

77
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,040
I gotta find you guys again.

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,470
I will get in this.

79
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,310
I just need a car.

80
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,810
Like this car.

81
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,180
Hey, I didn't even need to move it.

82
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,180
This moron ran into it for me.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:53,319
Who would drive directly into a helicopter?

84
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,319
It's gonna be like that, is it, boo?

85
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,319
No.

86
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,319
Dude, seriously, just get in the helicopter.

87
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:08,370
That's a nice little jump you found.

88
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,370
Alright.

89
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,670
Let's see how this works.

90
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,579
So everybody, keep you guys...

91
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,579
Is it straight down that way or straight down that way?

92
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,439
Straight from where you guys are?

93
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,439
Like right here?

94
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,620
Yep.

95
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,620
Alright, you guys ready?

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,790
Let's do it, baby, all at the same time.

97
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
Are we going?

98
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,480
Are we going?

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Yeah, just go.

100
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,040
We gotta line up.

101
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
We're not going fast enough.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Yeah, wait, wait.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Stop right there.

104
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Stop right there.

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,339
Stop right there.

106
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,339
Everybody line up right here.

107
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,339
We gotta get some speed.

108
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,519
Oh, watch out for the police.

109
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,519
This guy's after me, by the way.

110
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,519
This bastard's trying to kill me.

111
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,910
Alright, so everybody line up.

112
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,819
Just like good little boys and girls.

113
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,819
Are these kids in traffic?

114
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,819
Alright, you ready?

115
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,819
What is that guy's problem?

116
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,819
Alright, you ready?

117
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,819
Alright, you ready?

118
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,120
Yeah.

119
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Just like good little students.

120
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Ready?

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,180
One, two, three, go.

122
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Oh, the tandem.

123
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Here we go.

124
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
All go up at the same time.

125
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
See you later, guys.

126
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:45,649
Oh, there's just all kinds of explosions.

127
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:50,490
What is happening here?

128
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,490
Oh my god.

129
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,490
I love hitting my face on cars.

130
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,490
It is so...

131
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,490
Whoa!

132
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,060
Please don't kill me.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Please don't kill me.

134
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,740
Why am I running towards you?

135
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,740
I'm trying to jump and grab onto the ledge.

136
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,689
Come here.

137
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,689
I'm gonna get the ledge.

138
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:14,689
It's gonna be mine.

139
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:16,990
I'm going to get it.

140
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,990
I'm not careful, man.

141
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,990
You're going to slice off my head.

142
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,550
What happens if I hit you with the blades?

143
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,550
I don't know.

144
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,550
Let's find out.

145
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,550
Where am I?

146
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,430
Where am I?

147
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,430
You just zipped up into the sky.

148
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,319
I'm like...

149
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,319
I don't know.

150
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
If I scream, I'm black.

151
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,319
I take it you didn't survive then.

152
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,319
Oh, no.
