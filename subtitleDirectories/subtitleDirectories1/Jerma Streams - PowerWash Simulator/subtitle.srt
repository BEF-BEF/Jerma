1
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:21,429
I am on time. I am on time. I'm here. Clock. By what time it was. It was ready to go.

2
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,589
And I freaked out and I was like, I have to press the button right now.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:34,539
And landed on its side? What does that mean? Hello though, how are you?

4
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,859
Why do I feel like I'm so- I'm really tall right now. I need to- there we go.

5
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,829
My chair booster thing was up high.

6
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:50,810
The air thing that makes you go higher or lower. Anyways. Hello?

7
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:57,159
Today we're going to play Power Wash Simulator. The game that I've been talking about for a long

8
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:08,780
time. And look it, we're finally going to do it. In a booster seat is confirmed funny. All right,

9
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:59,750
let me just tweet this out. I'll be right back. Give me a second. There we go. I might- you know,

10
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,150
I might have to take- I might- I'm going to take a Tylenol. I woke up with a headache today. I need

11
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,889
like a- like ibuprofen or something. You know when you have that wicked bad headache brain?

12
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:18,919
Anybody else get this? Or your- like your head hurts. So therefore like words coming out is- comes

13
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:24,199
out slower. Like I'm talking right now, but there's- it's going through like a headache filter. You

14
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:31,500
know what I'm talking about? I hate that. Give me one more second. I'm going to take Tylenol.

15
00:02:31,500 --> 00:03:52,789
I'll be right back. Also, I feel like I'm way too close, yet way too far away from the screen at

16
00:03:52,789 --> 00:04:01,300
the same time. This is not right right here. Hold on. You know, I let Bugleberry borrow some of my

17
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:09,370
audio equipment and some of my monitors. He didn't- he returned them wrong. Move this back.

18
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:21,269
That's better. Stalling. All right. Everything's too close to me. Get away from me. All my things

19
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:29,139
are too close. I need to be sitting far away from my screen. He didn't change the category?

20
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:40,920
What? I'm still in hot tubs? What? No, I'm not. I hope not. My go live notification is Bugleberry's

21
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,839
cauldron? No, no, no, no. Fix that. Change that. That's not what I want.

22
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:57,189
He just does it again. Oh, dear. Okay. All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.

23
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:09,689
We're good. We're good. We're good. Career of ruining error. Oh, God. Oh, hey. Hey, Regan.

24
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,939
Thank you, Regan, for the end community subs. Appreciate it. And Farz. Thank you, Farz. One,

25
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:25,180
one, two, two, three. The community subs as well. Not- this is not a hot- I mean, there's no camera,

26
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,079
right? No. Where's the- there it is. We're doing Power Wash Simulator. I can't wait. I'm really

27
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:40,360
excited about this game. I thought this game was a joke. I willed this game into reality in my brain.

28
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Now I know that that seems incredibly egotistic and an insane narcissistic thing to say,

29
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,500
because this game's probably been in development for like a year or two. But if you remember,

30
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,170
six months ago, I was like, man, if there was only a game that you could just wash it and clean

31
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:05,139
stuff. And I could put my fingers on my head and I squeezed. In my brain, I willed this game into

32
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:21,000
reality. That's not accurate, but here it is. Okay, yes. Do I even have audio? I do. Oh, there's a-

33
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,350
this is- I don't- I've never played. We're gonna do career mode. We can't hear you. Yes, you can

34
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:36,779
hear- I can see the indicator. Uh, clean the van, this first one. Great news. Finally found a van

35
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:41,019
for you at one of the auctions under your budget. Don't freak out when you see it. It looks like

36
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:46,310
it's just been dredged from the bottom of a lake. Oh, I can't wait. But that's a good thing. It meant

37
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,899
no one else bid on it. They missed out. Underneath that hideous layer of gunk is your perfect

38
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,819
workhorse. Engine's a dream. No rust. There's even equipment in the back. Just needs a good

39
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,050
hosing down and you're in business. You'll certainly earn your pressure washing stripes

40
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,930
getting this thing clean because of- oh, there's a five-star rating and you earn money. This- okay,

41
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,069
I'm gonna- let's just be really, really clear. This- when did this game come out? This year?

42
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:19,050
Was it 2020 or 2021? When did it actually- well, is it- is it out or is it in early access?

43
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:35,620
I'm too quiet. Really? It shouldn't be. Hold on, let me see. Does the mic change? You know,

44
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:43,370
you let Bugleberry borrow shit and all of a sudden look what happens. How about now? Is that better?

45
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,920
Is that better? We good? I think this is where it was before. It got changed. I think we're good.

46
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,529
This might be the best game of the year for me. We'll find out. You guys ready?

47
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,389
Sound like Bugleberry. That was very loud. I'm really glad you didn't have to hear it.

48
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:11,910
All right, select nozzle. Raise lower tablet as escape. Okay, selecting nozzle. Select extension.

49
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:19,769
Select soap. There's different soap categories. Inventory. Rotate nozzle. Refill cleaning fluid.

50
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:27,670
Show dirt. Walk, crouch, jump. Oh my god, there's way more going on in this game. Let me turn the

51
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:34,919
volume down. It's probably really loud. Actually not that bad. Show dirt. I am. Is it an IDFOV?

52
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:54,409
Is it an IDFOV? No, here we go again. Is this an IDFOV? What do I do that? Control sensitivity.

53
00:08:54,409 --> 00:09:03,620
Controls. I think it is. All right, let's do it. So, uh, this sensitivity is way too high.

54
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:17,429
Way too high. Controller sensitivity. Oh, this is gonna be on console. All right, that's fine.

55
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,940
So what do we do? Spray? All right, just like strip the paint. That was way too much.

56
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:37,220
Oh my god, that's loud. Hold on. If you did that to a car, you would rip the paint off. All right,

57
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,740
the ambience is fine. The power washer needs to come down. Water reverb. Turn the reverb down.

58
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:51,029
All right, there we go. That's fine. I think that should be good. That's better. Oh my god,

59
00:09:51,029 --> 00:10:03,590
I love it. How do I change nozzle? Oh, I only have the stubby gun. 15 degree, 25 degree, 40 degree.

60
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:10,759
All right, this actually might be like the best game ever. This is what you, this is the one I

61
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,500
watch. I watch so many videos of people doing this shit. You have no idea. Guys, I will open

62
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,710
up a power washing video or like a wood cutting video and just let shit autoplay for hours. I

63
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,220
actually have a quick story for you. We're talking about autoplaying and maybe think about it. Um,

64
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,610
so like a week ago, like a week ago, I was watching TV and we're gonna go into a story here.

65
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,940
What's wrong with my voice? Hold on. We're gonna go into a story. Uh, so I was autoplaying videos

66
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,139
lying on the couch and I don't turn autoplay off. I know I just turned it up, but I always forget

67
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,659
to. And for some reason I'm never logged into YouTube, never logged in. I'm never logged into

68
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:03,769
any service. So even if I change it, I'm not going to be logged in the next day. So it doesn't matter.

69
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:10,279
So I'm on the couch lying down. I just had a big meal fucking Burger King. Just kidding. It was

70
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:19,480
McDonald's. I don't eat Burger King. And I fell asleep on the couch to autoplaying videos and I

71
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:28,070
believe it was cooking stuff. So I woke up maybe 20 minutes later and I was in that mode in my

72
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,220
brain where I just, I could not move. You know, you just, you just don't feel like it. Nothing will

73
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:39,019
make you get up besides like a fire alarm, right? Just like, I don't care what's happening. I don't

74
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:49,259
care what sounds are playing. I'm just going to keep sleeping. So I heard counting. It was like,

75
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:58,549
oh, like 2,448. 2,500. Who the fuck is counting? And I just went back to bed. I was like, I don't

76
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:02,309
care. I don't care to turn it off. I don't even know what it is. So I got up with like a second

77
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:07,509
or third time and I looked up and I was like, what is it? Why is Binging with Babish on the TV?

78
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:15,450
And I hear 30,345. I thought I was Binging with Babish doing like a counting video. So I was like,

79
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:22,759
I don't, I don't care. And I went back to sleep. And then later on, like the next day, I was like,

80
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:31,019
I'm curious, like what the fuck was that? And I watched on autoplay asleep, the entire Vsauce

81
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,820
Michael prime number video. It's like a four hour video. He says every single prime number up to

82
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:44,340
like 40,000. And it woke me up like three times. And each time I'm just like, shut the fucking

83
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:53,639
counting. Stop counting, please. But I was too lazy to actually get up. So I had, I feel like that

84
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,580
like gave me like a headache or something. It may have changed me forever. And I don't know why we

85
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:09,379
do that shit. Why do we do that shit to ourselves? And I, did you hear Otto? Let me get Otto.

86
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:37,639
Otto! It has to be a scientific reason for it. But the act of waking up like 20% the halfway,

87
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,029
whatever it is. It's like your alarm on your phone when it goes off. It's like, oh yeah,

88
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:51,419
I sleep through my alarms. You just don't care about anything but sleeping. Hearing four hours

89
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,899
of prime numbers was not enough for me to just, just to roll over and pick up the changer or the

90
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:08,809
phone and turn off the TV. That was too much work. But I just suffered, and I would say suffered

91
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:14,860
wrong, but it was so bizarre. My brain was trying to piece it together. It was like, why is Babish

92
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:26,779
doing this? Like what, what is this? I thought I was dreaming. Oh, Otto. He, I can't, he's over

93
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:35,320
there. Oh, this is going to be a good one right here. I love this. Oh, I hope there's wicked,

94
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,580
dirty houses too. I get to switch nozzles and stuff. I got to do the first coat first though.

95
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:54,970
You're jerking off to power washing porn. No, I love these videos. They really are. If you really

96
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:02,809
have trouble sleeping, like that's very loud. I got to turn that down. Um, you know, oh, I have

97
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:08,870
like the beach sound effects. I have the, oh, it just plays the ocean. It just plays the outside.

98
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:16,259
No, no, no. I want log cutting videos because every, every like hour at one of them, one eye

99
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:23,299
will open and I'll just open one eye and just see like, oh yeah. Then I'll go back to bed.

100
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:32,539
All right. These windows are dirty. What's going on? I love this game by the way. This is so much

101
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:42,759
fun. So the body is still dirty. I got to switch nozzles. What does this one mean? That's force.

102
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,169
This is so much better than I thought it was going to be. This is such a fun game

103
00:15:50,809 --> 00:16:10,970
because that's more pressure. Okay. There's even more grime on this thing. Hold on.

104
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:20,090
Just go outside. What do you mean just go outside? This is, you're using that wrong.

105
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:28,980
That term you're using that wrong. I don't have a car to power wash. This is not like I'm not

106
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:38,360
playing like soccer or football or anything. Dude, just go outside. This is an elaborate

107
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,659
power washing device. I don't have one of these. I'm making, I'm getting it a hundred percent.

108
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,460
There's a removals van outside my nightmare neighbor's place. They're finally going. Whoever

109
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:56,389
moves in there is going to need a quality pressure washer. I'm your guy. That's my

110
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:05,240
favorite part right there. None I got to do with. That's my favorite part of any car wash

111
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,130
because the water just like spins all in there and gets all in there,

112
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:19,289
flies around out in your face and stuff. I love it. You're a raid. Who raided?

113
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:34,329
Oh, RT game prop. What's going on RT? Thanks for the raid. What's going on RT gamers playing

114
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:41,750
power washer simulator. RT is a swell, swell lad. If you do not follow RT, what's wrong with you?

115
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:55,529
Oh, thanks a lot, dude. Welcome everybody. Raid song. I don't do raid songs anymore.

116
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,500
At this point, the raid song is becoming like a fucking reunion show.

117
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,259
You understand? Like how many times you want me to do the raid song before we go through like 10

118
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,819
seasons of raid songs and now it's just so I don't even want to hear the raid song anymore.

119
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:30,890
Press R to rotate. Oh my God. Thank you for saving this whole stream. I love it. Let's rotate.

120
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:39,559
Thinner. This is just one of my, I'm living one of my favorite videos.

121
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,670
I can just see like the dirt kicking out underneath that flap. I love it. This is so good.

122
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:54,019
This might be boring to watch. Oh, whatever. This is the rest of my life is right now.

123
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:07,619
Flip it. There we go. You can crouch too. There's a crouch. Oh my God. I love it. I, okay. I gotta

124
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:14,549
stop being like the person at the restaurant that tries everybody's plate and goes, oh my God. I

125
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:23,140
love it. Oh my God. So good. Wow. What did you get? I just keep saying that. Look at how much

126
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:38,279
distilled extra dirt. And the worst part is when you get somebody that does that and you can tell

127
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,900
that they like your food way more than their food. So they start like, yeah, yeah, but try mine,

128
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,819
try mine. I'm going to give you a bunch of my spaghetti. Like, oh, I don't want all your

129
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:55,859
spaghetti. Try my spaghetti. And then you realize that they gave you a huge portion of their food.

130
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,579
So now you are obligated to be like, oh, well, you know, here I get half, you might, you gave

131
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:05,059
me a lot of your caps of mine. Oh yeah. Sure. I'll try it. And they scoop off like half of your

132
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:13,460
fucking plate. Like you didn't get the fucking, you didn't like, sorry, you got the filet mignon.

133
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:26,950
I got them. Come on. What restaurant are we in by the way? I hate that I ordered. That's not

134
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:39,130
relatable anymore. That's no longer relatable. What? Cause I said filet mignon. No, let's change it

135
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:50,039
to McDonald's. I love that place. And that happens to me all the time. Billionaire Billy. No, that's

136
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:58,569
not what I mean. I was just saying a random food. Ever seen water pressure videos? I missed what

137
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:04,710
you said, but yeah, I love water videos. I got to get the roof. Wait, this is still dirty.

138
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:15,140
How is this still dirty? Oh shit. I bet you eat caviar. I think caviar is fucking disgusting.

139
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:28,890
I'm sorry. I don't, I think that's gross. I'll tell you why I think caviar is disgusting. It has

140
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,380
nothing to do with how the thing tastes. The reason why I think caviar is disgusting is the

141
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:39,339
same reason why I wouldn't open up 12 eggs and scoop them out into a fucking cup and drink them

142
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,960
like a bodybuilder. Now I don't want to, I don't want to eat raw eggs. I don't want to just like

143
00:21:43,960 --> 00:22:10,279
drink eggs. Why am I getting question marks? Do you guys know what caviar is? Drink the eggs.

144
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:25,819
Have you actually tried caviar? Who? Who? Who's that? Are you who-ing caviar? Why are you who-ing

145
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:33,430
caviar? It's not like a streamer. All right, change that nozzle. High pressure. Let's go.

146
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:48,680
You got to get the corners of the windows and then the middle. Dermot, stop. You're not using

147
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:58,740
any soap. What? I don't, you don't, what do you mean soap? I don't need soap. It's a power washer.

148
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:13,460
It's just the pressure of the nozzle takes out all the dirt, all the grime, all the filth,

149
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:20,890
and you don't need soap. Isn't that what they say in the commercials? All done with the power of

150
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:41,190
steam and liquid. Yeah, you don't need soap. Stop. What? Get down here. I mean, that was a really

151
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,950
just half-assed impression, but I'm busy enjoying this. You're going to need to, you're going to need

152
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,549
to go with that business name. What do you need me to think something up? I'm phenomenal. I thought

153
00:23:50,549 --> 00:24:08,730
of routing Thomas for that Tyler and she's never looked back. What? No, they really are hitting a

154
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:18,329
completely untapped market here. You're ignoring the story. All right, so what do I, I see a red

155
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:31,539
canister. Oh, I would never shoot a pressure washer at like a propane tank. None of this stuff can

156
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:46,740
even move, so don't worry. I clean the ground too. All right, what do I need? The body is still,

157
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,059
ah, okay, cool. That's cool. Cool. All right, the mirrors. Don't forget about your mirrors.

158
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:06,539
Turn it off. How is the body still this dirty? This is going to be such a huge moment for me.

159
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:22,779
I love it. Here we go. Stop saying I love it. Stop taking people's spaghetti. It wasn't a perfect

160
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:35,369
line, but it was good enough. Let's go wider. Just like the video. Yeah, you got to do it just like

161
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:46,789
the video. It's got to be like swoops. They do these huge sweeps. Yep, you got it. You're right.

162
00:25:46,789 --> 00:26:06,089
Exactly right. Use the jet pack. All right, I got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. How much more

163
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:19,259
is there left to do? This car is clean. There we go. All right, body is cleaned. Oh, back here.

164
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:31,849
Door is clean. Everything is clean here. Window, door, glass. What's that? What else? Oh, right here.

165
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:49,130
This is gross. This will be it for this one. What's dirty on the window? Where is it? Got it, okay.

166
00:26:49,930 --> 00:27:15,319
99% cleaned. Tire? What else? Grill? No, that's clean, man. It is the grill, but where? Up underneath

167
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:33,000
the lights? What? 99%. All right, where's the rest of it? Mirrors? Other mirror? Press tab. Oh,

168
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:47,000
shit. I feel like that's kind of cheating, don't you think? Come on. Where is this? It's just

169
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,440
cheating vision. It is. I haven't pressed the tab. I don't see anything. Oh, it's the tire.

170
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:18,950
Oh, my God. How am I ever supposed to get all that? Another tire? Yep, I did it. Job complete.

171
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:30,569
Open the tablet. Wait, is that showing everything I did? That's awesome. It shows the video of what

172
00:28:30,569 --> 00:28:41,640
you did. That's the greatest thing I've ever seen. How efficient was that? I would do the top first,

173
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:55,609
probably. Okay, cool. So now I got 150 bucks. Continue. Clean the back garden. It's 400 bucks.

174
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:02,069
What about the store? Power washers. A range of washers from small home units to industrial ones.

175
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:09,539
Cleaning liquids. Glass cleaner. Metal cleaner. Plastic cleaner. Universal cleaner.

176
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:17,779
But just get the universal one. Just put it on everything. From all surface materials.

177
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:26,069
Yeah, why would I get the... What do you mean no? Buy all the cleaners. It's more expensive. Yeah,

178
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:46,309
buy five bucks. Buy the stone. Buy the stone. Stone cleaner. I thought this said grass. Okay.

179
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:55,450
Equipment. Prime Vista 1500 turbo nozzle. Oh, shit. That sounds pretty good. It improves the

180
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:05,750
range while still being able to be used quite close to surfaces. Soap nozzle. I want... Okay,

181
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,500
I need the turbo nozzle. And I need this short extension. I want to save my money. Hold on. I

182
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,980
don't want to just buy a bunch of shit. Power washers. This is one I have right now. Surface,

183
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,910
encrusted, embedded. This is awesome. This is awesome. Everybody at the dinner table,

184
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,589
give me all of your plates. I'm eating all of your food. All of it. You know what? I'm eating

185
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:36,220
everything. I want to try all your food till there's nothing left on the plate,

186
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:47,829
and I'll give each of you 50 bucks. That fair? Medium. Heavy duty. Professional duty. How much

187
00:30:47,829 --> 00:31:04,470
are these? 2,000. All right, we're good. Let's go. Why don't just order food? Okay, I think I know

188
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,700
what you mean. Like, why would I just give everybody $50? Why wouldn't I just order

189
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,910
everybody's entrees? Because the entrees were like 30 bucks. 20 bucks. Why wouldn't I just order

190
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,019
three or four of the things that they had? I see what you mean. Yeah, okay. All right, let's keep

191
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:33,500
going. Career. Garden time. Let's do it. This one's gonna be fun. I'm gonna clean the grass,

192
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:43,369
too. Don't tell them we're gonna get 50 bucks. Uh, doc, I'll help you like a challenge because

193
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:50,309
I'm pretty sure I've got the dirtiest backyard you've ever seen. That's not me bragging, by the way.

194
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,549
I had nothing to do with it. I just moved back to town for a bit to help my folks. We're both down

195
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:59,420
to their last knee and rented what I thought was a great little place. Anyway, my girls are itching

196
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,700
to get out there. I don't want them still itching when they get back. All right, I'll clean the

197
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:15,450
grass. Do I have the new nozzle? Oh, this back here is not, this is nothing. This is, this would

198
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:29,579
take 10 minutes. I need, how do I, do I, how do I equip the nozzle? Is it already on? Oh, here we go.

199
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:41,980
All right, prime vista turbo nozzle. That's what's on. Why is it doing that? This, it just makes figure

200
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:55,480
eights? Well, shit, how am I supposed to put on the extension nozzle? This is all over the place.

201
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:09,450
All right, well, let's go for it. No, I hate that. Take it off now. Get it off. What the fuck happened

202
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:19,940
in here? Don't stop saying Aaron. All right, we're going to start with the, uh, we start with the

203
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:33,690
walls, the fence, even more pressure. This is wood. How do I put the soap on? Here we go. Universal

204
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:55,049
cleaner equipped. Is it on? I think it's on, right? Is it something neighbor to come on and be like,

205
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,890
what the hell? Why is there a bunch of drawings? I'm just going to draw like fuck you on the side

206
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:12,969
of their house. You need a soap nozzle at the tops. Don't hold on. You didn't buy the soap nozzle.

207
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:32,599
Oh, well, whatever. Oh, this is stuff. I can't, I have to say it, but I, uh, I don't want it.

208
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay. I'm not going to say it. Are you guys going to be ordering dessert? No, no, I'm stuffed.

209
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:52,469
How come we just can't say no? Just say, no, I don't want dessert. No, fuck, just go waiter. I

210
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:58,070
flew all I would. I just like so much food. Look at all this stuff. Just say I don't fucking want

211
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:09,269
dessert. Why does it make us look bad? I always make up like an elaborate story as to why I

212
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:18,059
don't want to order dessert. I don't want the waiter to think I'm like a weirdo or something.

213
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:27,260
Quit saying we, when it's only you. No, I know a lot of people do this shit, not just me.

214
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:47,349
What was that? You're crazy. I'm, I don't know. I always have this thing in my brain

215
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,349
where if you, if a good waiter or waitress comes over and they're like, oh,

216
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:56,070
would you like to see our dessert menu? And it's like, no, just like, oh, well, you don't even want

217
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:03,190
to look at it. Why? I, I don't want it. I know that's never going to happen, but it's this weird

218
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,550
thing in my brain that is going to happen. So instead of having to say no and be like, well,

219
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,710
you don't want to even look at it. I just go, I make up like an elaborate tale of why I can't

220
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,789
eat dessert today. Just say no, thank you. I know that's simple, but I, I had, there has to be like

221
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:26,179
a reason why I can't eat it. Like I lean back and I put my hands on my belly and I like rub it and

222
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:53,940
I go, oh, I would, but whoa, that's, that's weirder. Did you get to the horror part yet?

223
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,179
Oh, ban that guy. Is that real? I'm just kidding. Don't ban him. I know it's not real.

224
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:10,170
If you say, whoa, at a waiter, you should tip them $50. Uh, my base line of tipping

225
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:33,670
is at least 20%. That's the base. It only goes up from there. 21%. No, I hate, okay. What I'm

226
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,389
saying right now is the equivalent of, so if we go to a restaurant or something, if you go somewhere,

227
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:44,219
you sit down with some friends and that's like actually telling the waiter, oh, by the way,

228
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:49,260
I just want to let you know I'm a good tipper. Isn't that always seen to be the case that that

229
00:37:49,260 --> 00:38:07,929
person tips like 12% or like 8% or something. That's a lot of community subs. Uh, void 880.

230
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:23,320
Thanks for the, hold on a minute. Hey void. Hold on. Hey void. Hey void 880. Thanks for the

231
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:42,869
community subs. I was spelling the name. It's hard. I can't, it's hard to spell with a power

232
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:51,659
washer. But no, I, I know that saying that I tip well means I don't tip well. I just think I do

233
00:38:51,659 --> 00:38:59,239
for some reason. It's like, well, hell, yo, you think, you think like 7% is a good tip?

234
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,280
Of course I think it's a good tip. What do you mean? It's a, it's a tip. It's a very generous tip.

235
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:19,980
They forgot to fill my water, by the way. They didn't fill my water up twice. I mean,

236
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:26,630
you see how many people are in this place right now? I thought the waiter was, was pretty good.

237
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:38,039
No, and you know, I heard a sneeze. I heard a sneeze. So I, I don't, I don't, I'm not,

238
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:52,840
I don't like this place. Okay. Nice run. This one needs the more powerful one. Definitely. Oh yeah.

239
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:11,429
This one needs the, yeah. That's how you get in there. You're fucking up the flower beds?

240
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:26,329
Oh, I guess I kind of am, aren't I? You gotta stand back. Yeah, that's better. My dentist uses

241
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:41,340
this one. I actually love this thing at the dentist. I know we have talked about this,

242
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,820
but there's a lot of new people on this channel and we have to go over this again.

243
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:51,510
Everybody here hates getting their teeth scaled, right? They fucking hate it. Everybody here.

244
00:40:51,510 --> 00:41:00,949
Is that, am I, right? No, no, no, I actually like, see, this is what I don't understand.

245
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:09,239
There are a bunch of people that like this, getting their teeth scaled. That, it sucks. It's

246
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,079
horrible. It's one of the worst things I've ever, it's one of the worst fucking things.

247
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:21,989
Scaling, if you don't know what scaling is, it's that little knife hook that they scrape

248
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:37,369
your teeth gum line with. It's the worst thing on earth. Yeah. I, I hate it. Who wants that?

249
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,579
There's a bunch of people that like it. It's at least like 20, 30% of people that actually like

250
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:46,579
it. I know a handful of people that I've come across, friends, family. I know people that like

251
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:54,840
it. They're like, oh yeah, it feels good. Well, the reason why I bring it up is because they have

252
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,380
one, it's like a water scaler. It goes like this and they do that like all over your gums and stuff.

253
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:18,619
And I much prefer it over the scraping. All right. I don't go to the dentist. Well, then you missed

254
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:29,940
out on the goodie bag. Don't tell them, don't tell them about the goodie bag. If you've been

255
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:41,219
to the dentist before, you missed out. If people that have no idea what I'm talking about, they're

256
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:45,300
like, what do you mean the goodie bag? Oh, it's one of these people talking about

257
00:42:46,420 --> 00:43:06,070
no goodie bag. Okay. I still get the goodie bag. All right. Tell me if I'm crazy because I need to

258
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:12,650
know. Did you guys, when you were a kid, go to the dentist and after you were done, you got to go

259
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:19,670
to like the toy center and they had these little like small cheap toys. It was like a big treasure

260
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:30,099
chest that you can go like get toys from. That was awesome. That was the best part. When I still go

261
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:38,309
to the dentist, when they're done, I go, oh, there's cotton in my mouth. Can I get a toy? Can

262
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:48,860
I go to the toy box? And it's not even weird. They don't even care. Okay. Don't do that. I'm sorry.

263
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:58,380
I'm trying to, here's the thing about those toys that you got from the dentist. I have this like

264
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:06,949
memory. I can't remember any of them. They were all so strange. It was like a device where you

265
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:11,349
pressed a button and it made little water come up like colored blue colored water or something.

266
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:20,380
Like I, they don't even real toys. Well, one of them had like a, I'm making this up, but a string

267
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,269
attached to like a little bicycle thing and you turn the wheel and the string would fly around.

268
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:31,989
I don't remember any of them. They were only in the dentist's office. I've never seen them ever

269
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:47,269
again. Sticky hand. Oh yeah. They did have sticky hands. You're right. Bouncy balls. I don't remember

270
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:51,750
bouncy balls. I remember the weird like the rings. Yeah. It was the thing with the, I remember that

271
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:59,349
in the water. All right. This is still dirty, but I'm going to come back to it.

272
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:07,860
It's still a shitload of dirt on here. Where is it though? Oh, I've done that before. I've done that

273
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:13,929
before. How many of you guys have done yard work or helped it around the house? I've done that a

274
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:22,599
bunch of times or you don't, you just don't do the insides. You just do this and you don't do the

275
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:39,780
insides or the back. You just want to be done. Okay. I'll do the other side after. All right.

276
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:47,420
Should I do the patio furniture first? You should do that while painting. Well, I mean with paint,

277
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:56,710
you have to paint the fence. You can't just, what? So the only, yeah, it's when we, I don't know what

278
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:03,000
something, when I was like a teenager for some reason, but just being able to view it from this

279
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,199
angle and it looking clean was enough for me to think that my parents weren't going to care.

280
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:14,579
Just this picture, this snapshot was like, I did it. It's done. Oh yeah, it is done. And then like,

281
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,480
that's all it took for them to look. That only worked for about two minutes before they came

282
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,769
outside. And the weird teenager brain was like, yeah, that's enough to like fool them for me to

283
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:34,260
be able to ride my bike down the street now. I already told you guys how I mowed the lawn.

284
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:41,929
Everybody thought I was crazy. How I used to mow the lawn was I thought it was a genius idea

285
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:48,860
was I just did a giant circle and just every time I kept going, I went a little bit more

286
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:54,619
further on the line and I just kept going in a circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle,

287
00:46:54,699 --> 00:47:03,349
circle, circle, circle, until it was down in the middle. That's how you do it. I did that too.

288
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:11,110
Yeah. But the correct way is you go is like, you're not supposed to be like, just do a big spiral,

289
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:29,050
right? That's a great way to do it. All right. If you hired somebody to do this and you looked

290
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:39,510
outside and they were going like this, but they still did the job well, what's the scenario?

291
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:47,659
Like, let's say they did that. Is the scenario you don't call them back? You just go, thanks,

292
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,300
appreciate it. Thanks for the power wash. And you just don't call them back to do it again.

293
00:47:51,929 --> 00:48:06,179
Or do you say, Hey, stop doing that. Clean the car. I hold on. I'm getting clean,

294
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:26,219
overwhelming here. Oh, there's so much dirty shit. Is this doing it? Yep. It's like rust.

295
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:39,300
Can I get it with this? Are we going to go harder? That feels so awesome. What a simple concept.

296
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:53,099
It's perfect. All right. How many of you guys used to stand out here like this

297
00:48:53,099 --> 00:49:04,170
and pretend you had a flame thrower sprayed up and down? I remember, I remember like,

298
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,929
if you stood like far enough away. So let's say for instance, if like, if somebody was like there,

299
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,989
like where the, uh, the bird houses, I remember my brother used to stand really far back and just

300
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:22,309
go like this and it would, I, there would just be this mist that would overtake the whole area.

301
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:32,099
I ever tell you guys about how I used to put on hockey equipment and my brother used to like

302
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:47,849
throw baseballs at me. I did, right? Let me give context. Let me give context. Context, context

303
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:54,599
matters. Listen, listen, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The context matters. Just wait. So I have an

304
00:49:54,599 --> 00:50:01,670
older brother and he was a pitcher. So he was like, when he was younger, he was like, you know, in

305
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,829
middle school and high school, he was a pitcher. He played on baseball teams and stuff. And I played

306
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:11,510
baseball too, but I wasn't nearly as good, right? So he always wanted to practice pitching, but

307
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,510
at the house, it was just like, Oh, who do you practice with? Uh, I got, do you want to like

308
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:22,579
practice? I want to like try some new pitches. And I was not very good. And I was like, I was,

309
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:28,380
I was so scared of, of getting like drill with the baseball. So we put me in a bunch of hockey

310
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:32,780
equipment, like a hockey mask, hockey pads. I looked ridiculous. I had that bunch of like a

311
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:39,190
football pads on helmet, everything. And I would just sit out there with a glove and he would just

312
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:45,179
like, just gun them at me, like just whip them at me. And like, it would be like chest sometimes

313
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:49,480
because I couldn't catch very well, but I wanted to like help. I wanted to like, let him practice

314
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:57,610
half the time. The ball would just hit me like somewhere in the chest or like the knees or like

315
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:02,820
the face, but I had a ton of, I was covered. I think I even had pillows all over me too.

316
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:09,050
Yeah. I w we would, we like taped pillows to my arms and stuff. So like, it didn't matter.

317
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:20,380
And on the one or two times that I caught it, it just, it would hurt. It hurt. And I kind of

318
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,389
didn't want to catch it because it'd be like, he'd be like, all right, okay, here comes another one.

319
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:31,510
I'm going to, I'm going to try fastball and to be like, Oh, that sucks. This sucks.

320
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:36,469
So eventually I just like started pretending like I was terrible and just let them hit me in the

321
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:45,050
chest and like the face and stuff because it didn't hurt. You're explaining the story from

322
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:57,849
the mighty ducks. This happened though. I, this actually happened. And it got to a point where

323
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:01,530
he would, he, he would be like, you know, it'd be like after school or something. He'd be like,

324
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:05,610
Hey, Hey, Jeremy, you want to put the hockey pads on? And I'm like, yeah, I want to put the

325
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:14,599
hockey pads on. And that translated to a bunch of different activities that I could just, I was

326
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:28,469
going to never get hurt. I would never get hurt. It was like a little brother suit of armor that

327
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:42,550
I would put on. This is clean, right? This one little piece that's not, where is it? Would he

328
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:55,190
beat you up in the gear too? I mean, like maybe sometimes it would just like, like scoop slam me

329
00:52:55,190 --> 00:53:04,570
or something. But it was, it was, we were like doing something. It was like, Oh, we're going to

330
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:15,980
play like fighters or something. Oh, I'm going to get the hockey pads. Like we're going to do any

331
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,050
outdoor activity. And it required us to like do anything really active. I would probably just

332
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:27,179
put the hockey pads on because I just, what do you mean sometimes beating you up? No, no. This was

333
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:34,260
like, we were having like fun as brothers. And it was like, you know what? I'm just going to,

334
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:54,869
I'll put, I'll put the pillows on my arms just in case I don't get hurt. Repressed memory. I

335
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:59,750
just told you that it was like, it was fun to put the hockey pads on and like play baseball and

336
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:10,760
like run outside and do weird shit and like play fighters and stuff. As they made a product called

337
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,239
sock and boppers. Okay. Oh, what, what are you talking about? You, your brother used to like,

338
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:19,320
you used to put pillows on and your brother, you would like throw, you hold on and wait, wait.

339
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,840
There was a fucking product where you put these air gloves on and beat the shit out of each other.

340
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:40,300
This was not abnormal. Sock and boppers, sock and boppers. It's more fun than a pillow fight.

341
00:54:42,469 --> 00:55:02,230
You put on these kids boxing gloves and just beat each other up. Memory unlocked. I,

342
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,230
and now that I think about it, it's like, so there was a company that they really wanted to, oh,

343
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:10,789
like a pillow fight. Like people, like, uh, like brothers and sisters or party or something. You're

344
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:15,349
like just hitting each other with pillows. You know, you've got to be careful. Let's make kids

345
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:32,659
boxing gloves. It's like, wait, what? I did. I missed a spot. I just got it. All right. There

346
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:49,639
it is. Don't crouch. It's bad for your back. It was no ad. Your brother made a fake ad so he could

347
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:56,730
beat you up with those. Well, when my brother was fucking like 12 or 13 or something, he sure was

348
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:03,510
like a really great like engineer of plastic material. I don't know where he did that. And

349
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:16,659
well, that's very interesting. He had his own like factory, I guess. Oh, that's really dirty. Get

350
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:35,820
rid of that. Still on there somewhere. Where, where is it? Oh, that's very interesting. Oh,

351
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:50,579
that's right. Dirt vision, right? Sorry. I said, take a quick shower. Stop juggling.

352
00:56:51,380 --> 00:57:15,780
What's the age difference between you and your brother? Uh, 30 years. It's one star. I'm not,

353
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,539
I'm not going to just leave the job. I'm in the middle of doing this. It takes a while.

354
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:37,239
Oh, somebody in a pre-stream was just, I caught it. I caught it. I, look, I saw it. They said,

355
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:45,340
what the fuck is that from? Please tell me. I need to know. And like, I, I could tell you

356
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:51,849
an old sound effect. They used to put in lots of stuff back in like the early 90s, mid 2000s,

357
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:58,409
early 2000s. The one where it's the most prevalent is the first boss of the Simpsons arcade game.

358
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:05,449
He goes, and it's been stuck in my head for years and I can never get rid of it. And I just do it

359
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:16,659
sometimes, but it was, it was used a lot. I love cleaning rocks. I just got here. Has it been funny

360
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:20,340
yet? Oh my God. You have no idea. You missed so many funny stories. You missed so many funny

361
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,539
things. You missed like, I couldn't put the nozzle on right for like 20 minutes. Everyone was like,

362
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:40,219
pretending Pog. He's pretending Andy. It was awesome. This one's done. I don't even know.

363
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:53,320
Sometimes you clean it twice. This is good. Where is it? It's somewhere in here.

364
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:05,929
Fence post. Come on, get it. Fence panel, fence post. This is all good. All right.

365
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:26,519
I don't see anything. Here we go. I don't need that nozzle. Let's, yeah, there we go.

366
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:32,619
Wouldn't this fuck up the lawnmower? I have to imagine that spraying water inside of an engine

367
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:43,079
is probably not a good idea. Very dirty though. Oh, if you want to know what we're doing next week,

368
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:47,800
there's a couple of things that are going on next week. I'll tell you. So first of all,

369
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:56,920
um, E3 is this coming weekend. So that's perfect timing. Perfect timing. I'm going to stream on

370
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,179
Saturday and do the Microsoft conference. And then whatever's after that, I'm not going to do,

371
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:07,579
I don't really care about the Ubisoft conference. It really don't. I don't think it's, I really

372
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:16,699
don't think it's worth me streaming that conference, but we'll do Microsoft and we'll do Square Enix.

373
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:25,719
And then, uh, that same stream, I don't even, I'm, I might even just say like, oh, thanks.

374
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:33,079
It's my 10 year anniversary being on like line on YouTube and Twitch.

375
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:40,550
That's happening. I think on that, that's like Thursday of this week coming up. It's the actual

376
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:49,210
10 year anniversary. So I don't, I don't really have anything planned or anything.

377
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:54,980
I was kind of just going to bring it up. So I guess I just already did.

378
01:00:55,539 --> 01:01:07,400
That's the best bird shit nozzle. Probably this one. You're so old. I know I am so old

379
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:22,949
and I'm just getting older. I can go wider. Can I, I need to buy that soap nozzle. Let's

380
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:33,030
probably go so much quicker. Yeah. If I don't address it for some reason on next weekend's

381
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:45,909
stream, then yeah, I, I started doing YouTube when I was like 25 and here I am at 35. Yes,

382
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:52,440
that's how old I am. People think I'm like, I don't know why people think I'm like 23 or something.

383
01:01:52,440 --> 01:02:01,480
I might act like a fucking 25 year old, but I'm 35 and I pay taxes. No, they don't.

384
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:12,860
But yeah, I don't know. I, I have no idea what my future looks like. I don't know.

385
01:02:16,019 --> 01:02:20,420
10 years ago, if you told me that I was going to be continuing to do this 10 years later,

386
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:28,730
I would have been like, I don't think so. I have no idea. So it's surprising that this many people

387
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:47,380
are even here anyways. So this is still dirty. Oh, it's this. All right, let's get it a little

388
01:02:47,380 --> 01:03:03,289
deeper. Come on. Yeah. You, I've been watching you for 10 years. Ew. What do you mean? Ew.

389
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:15,460
I say, ew. How am I going to get on the roof? Is there a ladder? How do I get clean that?

390
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:32,309
I just have to jump. Holy shit. Okay. I guess I could, I'm going to take advantage of this.

391
01:03:46,679 --> 01:04:03,050
I am, you need the propeller. I would just open up the back slider at this point, like the back

392
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:07,530
door or whatever, and just be like, ah, there's a ladder in the garage, dude. Do you need it?

393
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:22,500
You don't have to do that. I need, uh, this is very dirty. Look at how dirty this is.

394
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:55,659
Don't fall off. I'm almost there. How's it look? Okay. We've been watching you since 2013.

395
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:03,579
Yeah. And I'll make the same reference here. That's very surprising to me

396
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:08,539
because after seven years of a TV show, we keep using that magic number of seven,

397
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:15,449
after the seventh or eighth season of a TV show, usually people start to get a little tired of it.

398
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:31,719
So I, I'm surprised that 10 years later, the TV show still exists, but you're a person.

399
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:40,039
Yeah, but still, I mean, usually there's a pretty finite amount of time that is super quote,

400
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:48,570
quote, quote, media is seen as worth watching, right? Remember you're the Simpsons of the

401
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:55,159
internet. Don't say that. Don't say that. I think there's like, I think there's like 30 people that

402
01:05:55,159 --> 01:06:07,610
still watch the Simpsons. I wouldn't say that. It could be a great show. I have no idea. There's a

403
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:11,769
really small amount of people that really enjoy that show still, and it might be the best television

404
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:16,539
out there. I have no idea. I haven't watched it in probably 10 years. I've not seen a single episode

405
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:30,230
of the Simpsons since probably like 2008. They definitely have your 18, 18.8 K Andy. Well,

406
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:35,909
I didn't say my, I did not say my show is better than the Simpsons. I didn't say I have more viewers

407
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:42,550
than the Simpsons. I said that maybe three people watch the Simpsons in every city, in every town,

408
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:48,170
in every state, in every country, in every province. I did not clarify what I meant by

409
01:06:48,170 --> 01:07:15,190
that statement. So in actuality, it's probably like 800,000, 600,000 people. Where's this dirt?

410
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:28,820
Simpsons for every home. I'll tell this story because it's kind of interesting.

411
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:35,989
So I was at the, I was at the pet store. This is literally yesterday. I was at the pet store.

412
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:42,300
I needed to get something for auto and I did not know where the object was. I didn't know where the

413
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:49,320
item was. So I walked up to what I thought was one of the employees and I was like, excuse me,

414
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:55,239
we're going to get like the dog beds that have the things so my dog can walk up the stairs.

415
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:58,760
Because auto has like, you know, I don't want him to be jumping or anything. So I wanted to be able

416
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,260
to go on one of those ramps and sometimes they sell them at the pet stores. So I'm like, oh,

417
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:09,739
do you guys sell those? And the guy goes, I don't, I don't work here. I was like, what?

418
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:16,170
And then the person that they were with was like, are you Jerma? I was like, wait, what?

419
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:22,010
Wait, I, I thought you were an employee. And I actually went like, oh, uh, what's, what,

420
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:28,060
what do you, Jerma, who's that? And they were like, Jerma Twitch. I was like, what's Twitch?

421
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:38,869
And they were just like, I, it's this, you're not Jerma. And I was like, oh, look at me.

422
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:42,229
And I did the look at me thing. I don't know. I was like, oh, maybe I'll like be funny about it.

423
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:50,260
And they were like, you are fucking Jerma, you liar. And I was like, yeah, it's me.

424
01:08:50,739 --> 01:08:56,470
So I, I just like, was like, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I thought you were like, I thought you've

425
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,869
worked here. Cause they had like a similar shirt on as like what the, what one of the employees

426
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:08,140
had on. And they were like, no. And I'm like, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Uh, this is real.

427
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:15,020
I swear to God. And no, they were really nice. They're really cool. It's that rarely ever happens

428
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:22,149
by the way. I wanted to talk about it though. The roof is done. All right. I got to get off the

429
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:30,260
roof. Stop doing the roof. But yeah, it was, uh, it was, it was really, they were really nice.

430
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,579
They're really sweet about it. I took a picture and I was like, oh, that was cool.

431
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:47,829
I just felt like an asshole. I felt like an idiot. It's a cringe streamer moment.

432
01:09:49,109 --> 01:10:06,939
What's the weirdest place you've been recognized? Um, probably in one of the casinos here happened

433
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:16,600
to like a couple of years ago. It was just like, Hey, I know you. It was like, oh, all right.

434
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:23,109
That was it. That was literally it. They just like knew that it was me. No, like we didn't talk

435
01:10:23,109 --> 01:10:28,630
about really anything. It was just kind of like, yeah, I know who you are. And then they just like,

436
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:32,310
they just went on with their rest of the, Oh no, no, somebody screamed at me. Somebody screamed at

437
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:38,680
me. Yeah. Somebody screamed at me from a car. Oh, I fucking forgot about this. I was at a mall

438
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:43,659
and somebody like was in the parking lot of the mall and they like drove by and they were like,

439
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:54,229
and I was like, what the fuck? Who's who is that? This is, this is like three or four years ago. I

440
01:10:54,229 --> 01:11:05,539
think. Yeah. They screamed my name and they were in a car and it scared the shit out of me because

441
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:14,279
I was like, wait, who, huh? And I think I just waved. I was like, hi, that was it. That was it.

442
01:11:14,279 --> 01:11:21,369
It was not like, Oh, hey, like, let's stop it. Like, Hey, are you? No, nope. They just screamed

443
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:37,479
my name. That was actually me. Oh, whoever you were. I mean, like you screamed at me. And that

444
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:59,189
was it. And I like, if anyone's like wondering, if you're like curious, I don't care. I don't care.

445
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:03,350
If, like, if you see me out in public or something, if you happen to think it's me or something,

446
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:07,189
you're like, Hey, I don't want to, like, I don't want to bother. He's probably so busy. Oh my God,

447
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,029
he's probably so he's probably, Oh, he's like the streamer. No, I'm probably literally like going

448
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:16,649
and buying like socks. Like I'm not doing anything important. If you would have like,

449
01:12:16,649 --> 01:12:21,319
waved me down and be like, Hey, are you? I'd be like, yeah, I'll probably talk to you for a

450
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:26,659
little bit. Wouldn't be like it. That doesn't bother me though. So if you're, if you ever do

451
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:34,630
see, you ever see me out in public, you know, I don't care. As long as you're not like fucking

452
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:40,899
weird. Like if you're not weird about it, I don't care. Don't be weird about it. You know what I

453
01:12:40,899 --> 01:13:04,279
mean? Yeah. Yeah. Let me be the weird one. Let me be the weird one. I like the, I like this,

454
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:13,979
this nozzle better. Oh, come on. Don't be weird. But I would use that as a blanket statement for

455
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:23,779
everything though. Just don't be weird. You know what I mean? I'm really happy to like

456
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,880
talk to people and hang out with people just for like a little while. But like,

457
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:31,560
I just don't be weird about it. Like I, I, I, I, I don't want to, I don't want to be weird to you.

458
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:37,579
Right. But I did say, I did do like look at me in the middle of a pet store, but like whatever,

459
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:47,619
like whatever, let me be the weird one. If other people there must've been like,

460
01:13:47,619 --> 01:14:11,979
what the fuck is going on? Who is this guy? If I see you in real life, can I give you

461
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:30,949
bits or subs? No, I literally will not. I will not accept that. Real bits. No.

462
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:48,069
Where's the dirt? Edges? Yep. Uh-huh. What about a gift card? If you give me a gift card,

463
01:14:48,069 --> 01:14:51,510
I'm going to do what everybody does with gift cards. And I'm going to put it into my wallet

464
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:58,359
and forget it's there for a year or two. And then by the time I want to use it, the store

465
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:03,500
that you gave me the gift card to, I probably not even, I probably don't even have one near me

466
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:14,010
anymore. I don't know. Like I may have like moved across like the state lines at that point. And

467
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:28,149
that store doesn't even, I don't have one of those near me. Okay. What's next? I got all that.

468
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:42,140
That's good. 32% clean. What else is left? Oh shit. All this stuff. What the fuck? I just

469
01:15:42,140 --> 01:16:29,829
cleaned this. What? Go. Let's go thinner. Yeah. No. Yeah. Oh, sunflowers. I have those. Congrats.

470
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,800
Yeah. That was my, that was my way for you to be like sunflowers. What do you mean sunflowers?

471
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:43,000
Dermot sunflowers. And then I get to tell you about all my gardening. I'm annoying. I'm really

472
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:59,689
annoying. Look, I'll just tell you about it. And then you can just look at your phone and say every

473
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:18,520
last word of every sentence that I say. Okay. Would you, should you not do this to upholstery?

474
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:33,640
I feel like you don't do this to upholstery. So I have some flowers and I've got four in a big pot

475
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:45,260
and they are just barely going into adulthood. And I'm really into it. I think it's a really cool

476
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:56,819
thing. They're very big. They're going to be probably six feet tall. Yep. Yep. Yep. You're

477
01:17:56,819 --> 01:18:00,500
paying attention. I know you are. Otherwise, how would you know the last word that I just said?

478
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:08,149
Uh, I don't know. I forget the exact name. I think they're, uh, I'm going to get, I don't

479
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:13,689
want to say the wrong name, but they're going to be really tall. I go out there every day.

480
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,159
You're like on your phone. Someone's telling you a story. You just type it away.

481
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,960
And so it was really cool when they came over and, uh, uh,

482
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:43,029
why is it? It's like, what the fuck, dude? Give me the big one. Oh, this is fucking filthy.

483
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:53,270
Do I have any other flowers? Oh, I have a, I have a money tree. That does not stay outside though.

484
01:18:54,539 --> 01:19:06,520
Money tree is, uh, inside. Money tree. They're really cute. It's a, it's a little one. It's one

485
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:13,300
of those, uh, small, uh, braided ones. I have a few succulents that sit in a little container.

486
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:20,060
And then I have, I don't know what it's like a little, it's a little like polka dot plant.

487
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:23,180
I forget what it's called, but it's this little, it says like it's, it's small. It's maybe about

488
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:31,109
as big as a baseball. It has green, pink polka dot leaves. It's almost like the channel colors.

489
01:19:31,109 --> 01:19:37,220
It's really cool. And I take good care of them and I love them very much.

490
01:19:46,539 --> 01:20:14,140
Oh, gross. Did poison ivy? No, it's like a, it's like a little desert plant. Jesus. He's

491
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:22,550
still playing video games. What did you expect me not to be playing games anymore? I still play

492
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:38,359
games like occasionally, right? I play games like this because this is sick. Turns out they're

493
01:20:38,359 --> 01:20:49,939
literally called what? I missed it. I need to get up there. Let's do the car. Play backgammon next.

494
01:20:50,579 --> 01:21:00,220
I don't even, I don't know how to play backgammon. Backgammon was always a game that somebody had

495
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:22,229
in their house as a display. I never took it out of the box. Ooh, that looks nice actually. Play

496
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:34,649
blackjack in Fallout New Vegas. Yeah, that one. It's the car from the carnival. It kind of does

497
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:51,319
look like that. Uh, give me the red one. This one's better. Gambling stream when? Isn't gambling,

498
01:21:51,319 --> 01:22:04,729
isn't like gambling on Twitch now? Yes, lots, lots. You know, I really didn't, I thought,

499
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:11,739
I never thought that slots were going to be a thing. I always knew that like, yeah, you could

500
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:15,260
do it, but I never thought it would be, honestly, I'll take, I'll take the loss on that one. I thought

501
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:23,220
it was going to be Battleship. Honestly, I thought it would, I would have been Twister before it would

502
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:44,140
have been slots. We just went right to slots, huh? Twister is, oh, by the way, I forgot to say this.

503
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:51,050
I watched the entire movie of Son of the Mask last night. I don't know why. Do you know why?

504
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:59,369
This is, this is weird to say. I don't, I, I, the movie sucks, okay? But listen, I wanted to watch

505
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:07,420
all like the really shitty scenes in a row, but I didn't want to open up like 10 YouTube tabs

506
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:19,270
to watch just the scenes of the movie that I wanted to watch. So I just rented it and I just

507
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:25,670
got, I just did the thing I was going to do anyways. The best part of that whole movie is

508
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:29,029
the part where he goes, you're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You're

509
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:32,630
just too good to be true. You're just too good. Oh, it's, it's so bad. I hate it, but I watch it all

510
01:23:32,630 --> 01:23:37,399
the time. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You're too good to be

511
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:58,140
true. I know I love you so much. Yes, I watched Son of the Mask before Megamind. By the way,

512
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:02,779
there's something I didn't realize about Son of the Mask. I've never seen that whole movie start

513
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:09,210
to finish even, even 10, 20 years ago, whatever, when it came out. The, the, the actor would,

514
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:15,850
would Jamie Kennedy, right? He only puts the mask on like twice in the whole fucking movie.

515
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:24,409
That whole movie is the, is a cartoon baby versus the dog. He puts the mask on twice in the whole

516
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:29,210
movie. He puts it on the very beginning and then at the very end, he doesn't ever put the mask on.

517
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:35,180
What the hell? The dog has the mask on in the movie more than he does. What do you mean spoilers?

518
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:57,720
Nobody cares. Stop spoiling Son of the Mask. I didn't tell you the plot of the movie. I just

519
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:07,779
told you that the, the, all right. So Jim Carrey was the mask, right? And oh my God, it's one of

520
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:14,020
the best movies ever made, right? And we all can agree on that. That's, that's a simple fact, right?

521
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:19,779
I still just have to, I don't know why they made another one without having Jim Carrey be the mask.

522
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:40,810
Like, well, why would you even do it? It doesn't make any sense. Get it. This is almost done.

523
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:48,760
Movie is a really awful adaptation of the comic. Yeah, I've heard of that. That's the original.

524
01:25:48,760 --> 01:26:07,369
The original comic is like kind of like dark and awful, right? All right. Looking good.

525
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:11,300
It's just, I, do I have, I have to get a hundred percent. I can't not get it.

526
01:26:11,859 --> 01:26:20,550
This is going to give me a ton of money too. Oh, that's, it's better just to see this.

527
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:36,250
The comic have Jim Carrey in it. Um, wait, what? What are you talking about? No, no, it was for

528
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:44,380
money. I guess, but the only reason why it made any money is because Jim Carrey was the mask.

529
01:26:45,020 --> 01:27:02,779
How am I going to get in this crevice? God damn it. I need a hundred percent. There's stuff in the

530
01:27:02,779 --> 01:27:15,029
crevice. What about Sonic the Hedgehog? I thought he was good in Sonic the Hedgehog. I saw it.

531
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:26,260
This is another thing. Like look, Jim Carrey, Jim Carrey is, Jim Carrey is old now. He's like older.

532
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:30,020
I wouldn't say he's like an old man, but he's, he's like 60 or something.

533
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:46,039
Now the stuff that he was doing in his late twenties, early thirties, like Ace Ventura and

534
01:27:46,039 --> 01:28:00,039
stuff. I mean, he's, he can, he's still got it. I think he's still got it. Nineties, Jim Carrey is

535
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:06,100
peak. I'll tell you, and I mean this very, very much so. If there's no Jim Carrey, there's no

536
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:19,609
Jerma. I'm serious. I don't do any of this stuff unless I thought he was really funny.

537
01:28:20,569 --> 01:28:36,789
Telling you. Give me the big, the big, yeah, that one. Bro, sorry. We're going to clean up the grease.

538
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:46,949
You're a Walmart Jim Carrey. Oh, that's fine. I will never, I will never be Jim Carrey. That's

539
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:54,460
fine. Yeah. I don't care. In fact, don't even, don't even use my name in the same sentence as

540
01:28:54,460 --> 01:29:00,779
Jim Carrey. Like, oh, you're a this Jim, no, no, no, don't even say that. Remove me from Jim Carrey.

541
01:29:00,779 --> 01:29:30,020
That's not enough for grease. Shit. I can only get it off with this one. It feels so good. I love

542
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:42,279
this game. I know. I don't care if I keep saying it. Jim Carrey would be proud of you as their son.

543
01:29:43,699 --> 01:30:02,500
All right. Now we're getting weird. This, now this is getting weird. It is now it's getting weird.

544
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:09,539
What? What did I say before that made it weird? You're just too good to be true. Can't take my

545
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:18,119
eyes off of you. I know I love you so much. I can't. I'm going to watch it again tonight.

546
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:51,699
FAD. Watch that scene on stream. I can't. DMCA exists, guys. I can't do that. What do you say?

547
01:30:51,699 --> 01:30:57,460
Am I going to what? What did that person say? Am I going to what? Are you going to go on schooled?

548
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:23,000
Um, what do you mean schooled? Joe Biden is the son of the mask. Ms. Kiff's show. Oh, oh, okay.

549
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:41,449
Did I admit? Does he want me to do it? Are you guys just saying this? Is this, hold on, is this

550
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:45,689
one of those things where like you get the streamer to say the other streamer's name,

551
01:31:45,689 --> 01:31:49,689
so then the other streamer then has to say and like react to me because I said the streamer's

552
01:31:49,689 --> 01:32:03,180
name? Is that what we're doing? Or did he actually say this? Ego Andy. I didn't say. What are you

553
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:28,970
talking about? What about a banana? He said he hates you. No, he didn't. I know that for a fact.

554
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:39,060
I just watched that scene from Son of the Mask and it sucks. I know. So why don't you watch the

555
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:44,380
whole movie to just here's the thing. I don't even hate watch stuff. That would be classified

556
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:52,630
as hate watching, right? I don't even hate watch it. I'm like happy that I'm there experiencing it.

557
01:32:53,350 --> 01:33:01,659
I don't know. It's weird. It's not hate watching because I don't hate it. I'm just so intrigued by

558
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:24,060
it. Does that make sense? That looks good, right? Oh, no. Whoa, what the fuck? You can prone like

559
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:31,930
Cod. Well, I'll say the same thing I say every time about like collabing with other people.

560
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:39,689
As you all know, I do collabs when I think they make sense or if there's a thing I think would be

561
01:33:39,689 --> 01:33:47,800
fun. I do things with other people sometimes. I, the most part is just me. I don't know. I'm

562
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:54,340
not against doing anything with anybody. It just, I usually do things alone. We've talked about other

563
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,909
streamers before. If it sounds like something fun, sounds like something I'd want to do, I'll do it.

564
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:28,220
That's it. There's no other motive or anything. Mr. Incredible One. What if it happened to the

565
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:36,439
card game? Are you talking about Grotto Beasts? The card? The real card packs that yield the real

566
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:40,520
cards you'll be able to open very soon? Is that what you're referring to? You're talking about

567
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:47,319
the Grotto Beasts cards that you'll be able to buy and have in real life soon? Is that what you're

568
01:34:47,319 --> 01:35:16,579
referring to? Yeah, I mean, that's not, it's not ready yet, but it will be very soon. It'll be soon.

569
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:23,060
He always says soon. Yeah, soon could mean whenever. It can, it's soon is soon. Soon is when you get it.

570
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:31,689
Soon. Okay, listen. Soon means real. That's all you need to know. Soon means it's real.

571
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:48,760
All right, that's good. That one's done. Wait, this backyard's done. It looked like a pretty good

572
01:35:48,760 --> 01:36:19,779
backyard. What if there's a bird in here? You're causing from Boston. God damn it. I don't want

573
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:27,460
to hurt the bird in here. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. Everybody get ready. It's

574
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:34,810
time. Shoot the target in front of you and ready go. Fuck. Now I lost. God damn it.

575
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:42,520
That kid next to me did it perfectly fine. But I'm just, don't just let go. Why even do it anymore?

576
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:48,779
I'm not going to, I'm not going to get to the end. Why even, why even continue if you didn't get it

577
01:36:48,779 --> 01:37:11,369
the first time? Probably should have been mine. Term is bad in Amusement Park games. No, that

578
01:37:11,369 --> 01:37:17,020
happens every time. If you are doing that game and there's 10 of you there and you're ready,

579
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:21,260
you're lining it up and it's like, and start. It's over. You lost. You've lost. It's over.

580
01:37:21,989 --> 01:37:26,310
You've lost. If you end up, like we all do, there's one person that gets it right and they win.

581
01:37:37,109 --> 01:38:05,340
Gosh. What the fuck? What the fuck? Are you kidding me? Who wrote this? Who wrote that? What the

582
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:20,310
heck are you doing? Oh my God. That's so funny. Wait, I don't want to do that last. Is this done?

583
01:38:20,310 --> 01:39:17,060
What? How am I supposed to get in there? Really? Underneath. Oh shit. I'm hurting the bird.

584
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:35,819
Ms. Kiff, I'll do it. I don't even know what I just agreed to. Why don't you be like, oh yeah,

585
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:46,869
yeah, what's going to happen is, oh no. What do you mean oh no? No, I'm not invited. Did you guys

586
01:39:46,869 --> 01:40:05,609
just gaslight me? Oh no, now I look like a fucking idiot. Like accepting an invitation I was

587
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:12,869
never invited to. Oh man. All right. How do I fix this? I got to fix this. What do I do?

588
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:26,520
You just self-invited? Did I? Was everybody just saying that? Just go offline, bro. Oh, I got to

589
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:41,130
go. I'm out. I'm out of here. Wait, I want to do the furniture first. Just agreeing to something

590
01:40:41,130 --> 01:41:03,109
that A, I was probably never invited to and B, I don't even really know what it is. Oh, I like the

591
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:23,640
umbrella. Little bro, apologize. Your ego is showing. Is it? I didn't do anything. What did I do?

592
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:29,909
Did I do something? Is being like a 20k Andy like fucking up my brain? I don't know. Is it?

593
01:41:30,710 --> 01:42:00,949
What do I do? White noise. Ms. Kip just said yes. Next week. Next week? What do I have to do?

594
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:13,079
I have to travel or something? What do we do? What? All right. Stop. All right. I stopped lying.

595
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:21,560
Stop lying. Are they lying? I just got pity invited. No, don't say that. All right. I'm

596
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:25,800
going to stop addressing it. And if it's real, then I'll figure it out. If it's not real, then

597
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:29,479
it was fun. And I'm sure it's a fucking awesome show. I really think it's probably really fun.

598
01:42:30,199 --> 01:42:53,899
You're old enough to be their grandpa. Am I? How old am I? They're saying you have

599
01:42:53,899 --> 01:43:06,300
to come in as the sus guy. They want the sus guy? No, they don't. That would be hilarious

600
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:21,899
if they actually did though. He said hello. Well, I say hello back. Why is this like,

601
01:43:22,779 --> 01:43:28,460
okay. Oh, can you tell, can you tell them that I said hi and I think they're cool?

602
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:34,710
You just go tell them. I don't want to be your messenger. No, you do it. Right? I'm saying it.

603
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:43,659
Hey, what's up, Mizkif? How you doing? Hope things are going well. He's not even live.

604
01:43:45,619 --> 01:44:00,470
Oh, I'm being gassed. Yeah, I'm being gassed. All right. This is whatever. Let's move on from

605
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:05,590
this. We're going to move on. I'm looking forward to. I don't even. All right. Cool.

606
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:10,630
This might be fun. I don't know. I don't even know what it is. Sure. Let's do it. What is it?

607
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:34,439
I don't know. That sounds good. You're a sussy baka. It's like. Hold on. Let me read this. It's

608
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:42,439
like. It seems pretty hype that you said, yes, he's pogging. Oh, all right. That's yeah. Cool.

609
01:44:42,439 --> 01:44:48,340
What are you doing? I'm power washing. Don't waste a weekly stream. No, I would be on top

610
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:56,310
of what I was doing. It wouldn't be. I wouldn't replace anything. The quiz show on school questions.

611
01:44:56,310 --> 01:45:17,779
Oh, he said it would take you 10 minutes. Are you smarter than a Twitch streamer? LOL.

612
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:23,899
Okay. Is it actually like that? Because what if I get every single question wrong? Am I going to

613
01:45:23,899 --> 01:45:38,500
look bad? Oh, shit. I got to like study or something. When is this happening? I'm going to

614
01:45:38,979 --> 01:45:44,069
make sure I can even do this. I might have to do it the next time they do it. If it's real.

615
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:56,340
It's today. It's not today. It's every Monday. All right. Let's hold on. I'll figure this out.

616
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:07,420
You're late. Hurry. Oh, shit. I got to get over there. What's my first question? What genus

617
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:26,149
is the canine family from? Arachnophobia. Kick him off the fucking stream. I'm gone. How's that

618
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:41,880
look? Awful. Did I hear about the new house flipper DLC? Yeah. We play every house flipper

619
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:57,420
DLC. It doesn't matter how long or short it is. You'll see it on this channel. Don't cheat. Why

620
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:10,539
would I? I'm not going to. What do you mean cheat? No, I got nothing to hide. Like really. Like if

621
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:15,500
everyone thinks I'm stupid, whatever. If I can't answer like a fourth grade, fourth grade, whatever.

622
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:18,600
If I can't answer that question, then I can't. And that's what that's the way it is.

623
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:41,260
Oh, no. I'm regressing into a fourth grader. I'm method acting. I'm getting ready. This thing. I

624
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:52,329
need an upgrade. Bad. 100 percent. He'll have you on. All right. Well, we'll figure it out. Maybe

625
01:47:52,329 --> 01:47:57,689
if it's not this time, then I don't want to just fucking just jump in and be like, oh, you said yes.

626
01:47:57,689 --> 01:48:00,970
OK, I'll see you tomorrow. Like, no, if they got plans, they got plans. I'll do it one of

627
01:48:00,970 --> 01:48:06,539
the other times or something. I don't know. We'll figure it out. I make I have no plans, guys,

628
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:27,819
when I do anything with anybody. You come over and have lunch with me sometime.

629
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:43,930
No, I will not. I'm sorry, but I don't do that. I can help you pick out what you'll

630
01:48:44,010 --> 01:49:06,890
eat for lunch today about about a turkey club. That sounds kind of good, doesn't it?

631
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:11,130
Somebody said, is this a minigame? What's the actual game? Yeah, this is a minigame.

632
01:49:12,569 --> 01:49:14,649
This is a this is like a new shooter that came out.

633
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:19,050
There's like a side game where you can like actually just go power wash stuff.

634
01:49:19,689 --> 01:49:28,920
It's like a backyard like like water, like battle game. You get the different nozzles.

635
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,279
This is like a shotgun. And it's just like you spray like each other with water,

636
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:37,960
like Super Soakers. But it is a second game that lets you kind of use all the available

637
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,920
stuff they use in the actual game. You can come and just power wash. It's really cool.

638
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:49,939
I'm really into it. The game is called Soaker Sloshers. But this is like a power wash thing

639
01:49:49,939 --> 01:50:16,420
that they have in it, which is kind of cool. It's called Splatoon and it's real. No,

640
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:25,819
the game is called Soaker Sloshers. And I'm playing the minigame playing the minigame

641
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:46,569
of Soaker Sloshers. No, the trim here. I'm almost done. Look at this. All I have is just

642
01:50:46,569 --> 01:50:56,470
this really dirty muddy thing and a little bit more of the patio. New job available.

643
01:50:57,029 --> 01:51:04,260
This is like when your parents see you playing GTA and you pretend it's a different game.

644
01:51:04,979 --> 01:51:11,770
What do you mean? Like you're in you're playing the golf or something

645
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:28,760
in GTA and you just say you're playing a golf game. You're gonna do more DOS?

646
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:38,060
Probably eventually. It's not now. There's always there's always time for DOS.

647
01:51:38,619 --> 01:51:56,090
Those games are never going away. This umbrella is filthy. You just pretend GTA is a race game,

648
01:51:56,090 --> 01:52:05,939
racing game. Yeah, but then you have to play really well. Oh, no. Yeah. What are you playing

649
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:11,880
in here? Oh, it's just a racing game. Oh, and then you don't realize like you're watching

650
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:17,739
and you just ran over like three people and like crashed. Oh, really? That's interesting.

651
01:52:17,979 --> 01:52:30,069
You can there's people you can you hit someone. Oh, oops. How do you explain that one away?

652
01:52:30,069 --> 01:52:45,800
You can't. I don't want to just go here and just smell this water.

653
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:50,920
I want. OK, so I want to be standing here. I want to be standing right here.

654
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:57,020
I want someone to go like this, bounce it. So this vapor goes right into my face

655
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:26,699
and I can just sit there and just so dirty under here. Savory. No, it's a it's just water vapor

656
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:51,210
that I just like to be near. Oh, I don't vape. I find it disgusting. Don't do that shit. OK,

657
01:53:51,210 --> 01:53:58,300
like this is a public service announcement. Don't cut that out. Cut that out. Cut it out.

658
01:53:58,859 --> 01:54:15,460
Shut up, Dad. No, cut it out. Cut that shit out. Cut it out. If you're thinking about quitting,

659
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:23,609
you're thinking about make this be the time you do it. Make this be the make this be it.

660
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:40,390
That's it. That's just it. That's it. What a shitty PSA. Hey, German 985 here.

661
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:44,470
Just want to say if you vape, just cut cut it out. Cut that shit out. Stop doing that.

662
01:54:45,500 --> 01:55:17,510
All right. Done. Don't do that anymore. I need a wider nozzle. Is this a let's see.

663
01:55:18,069 --> 01:55:50,619
Yeah, this is getting it. Damn it. I screwed it up. What if I power washed a real patio?

664
01:55:51,180 --> 01:56:07,180
Would you guys watch it? Would you like if I if I just like tried to find somebody that had like

665
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:12,579
a really like kind of dirty backyard and dirty house? I just did it for free. I was like, hey,

666
01:56:12,579 --> 01:56:17,140
can I like just power wash your whole entire yard and do and take into clean up your whole house?

667
01:56:17,939 --> 01:56:23,189
Yeah, you just have to let me film in your house or on your like property.

668
01:56:23,189 --> 01:56:27,619
I don't need anything else. I don't care about anything else. You think people would do that?

669
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:33,260
And I would sign a death waiver, too. You know what I mean? So don't worry about that. It'd be

670
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:37,779
like, oh, what about that? I would sign like a death waiver. I guess like a fucking piano

671
01:56:37,779 --> 01:57:04,869
fell on me or something. Don't worry. Almost done. This is a little bit more of that. And then just

672
01:57:04,869 --> 01:57:18,010
this really muddy, dirty area here. I think I would be pretty good at that. I really think

673
01:57:18,010 --> 01:57:38,579
I would do a pretty good job. Eat the BTS meal. What's what's the BTS meal? What it puts in it?

674
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:57,989
McNuggets, the 10 piece nugget with sauce. That sounds fucking great. I love the nuggets.

675
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:14,619
I'm a huge McNugget guy, so that meal that I would eat that. I do have a question, though. So

676
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:19,369
a lot of people have meals at McDonald's, right? It's like, oh, this meal, this like

677
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:24,729
these musicians or this these actors or is it going to get we're going to get to a point where

678
01:58:25,659 --> 01:58:32,250
just the regular McDonald's meal is just like celebrities. Instead of ordering like a Big Mac,

679
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:43,579
you order like the kind of like, you know, like the Larry David sandwich. Like, oh,

680
01:58:43,579 --> 01:58:48,859
you're just on the board. It's like it's Larry David. It's not like a like a whitefish sandwich.

681
01:58:48,859 --> 01:59:00,779
It's the Larry David. I do love nuggets, though. What's the sauce? What's what's the difference?

682
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:13,659
What's the what do you get for ordering that? It's like some Cajun sauce. Wait, is that did they

683
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:27,159
have it? Really? It's a cage like a chili sauce. Cajun sauce. Holy shit. That sounds really good.

684
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:44,569
And a new sauce. All right. I kind of want that. It's a new sauce. Oh, shit. OK.

685
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:09,979
Eat it live on stream. I'm just going to enjoy it. My own time. I don't want to eat on stream.

686
02:00:09,979 --> 02:00:26,699
I don't want to eat on stream. No, I want to enjoy my food on my own time.

687
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:32,100
Go ahead. Call me a coward. That's why I don't want to eat on camera.

688
02:00:40,970 --> 02:01:18,729
Do it as Catboy. I'm going to have to ask Catboy. It's probably going to be no. I just don't like

689
02:01:18,729 --> 02:01:23,289
people looking at me eating or anybody else for that matter. I don't I don't want you to look at

690
02:01:23,289 --> 02:01:31,529
me chewing and hearing like that. I'm going to make me laugh and I'm going to go. I don't want

691
02:01:31,529 --> 02:01:35,770
that to happen. Like someone's going to make me laugh really hard. I'm going to have french fries

692
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:41,460
in my mouth and I'm going to go. I fucking don't want that. No.

693
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:29,539
I got to get in the crevices. What's that from? I already talked about it.

694
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:53,140
I got to get inside all these crevices like this. 15 million off the dead if you eat nuggets as

695
02:02:53,140 --> 02:03:15,779
Catboy. That's not worth it. That's not going to make a dent. 200 million. No, no.

696
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:34,699
Guys, I don't even know where Catboy is. I don't even know. I have no idea. Half the characters

697
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:39,130
that are made just fuck off and they just disappear into the woods and shit. I don't even know where

698
02:03:39,130 --> 02:04:33,050
they go. Some of them we see. Where did what? Who made Bugleberry? I don't know. I met Bugleberry.

699
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:59,270
I found him on like Craigslist. I don't know who made Bugleberry. I hired him. Come on and read

700
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:07,539
some scary stories. That's what it said he did and he was really, really kind of an interesting

701
02:05:07,539 --> 02:05:10,659
guy. So I was like, Oh, I kind of, maybe you'll come back or something. Do some more stuff.

702
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:15,800
He did like kids birthday parties and everything. There was, he had a whole thing.

703
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:42,539
I don't know where he's from. I am almost done. You're right. What about chrome face? He's got

704
02:05:42,539 --> 02:05:52,779
these fucking urns, dude. I don't know. I don't know what any of that stuff is. He create, he

705
02:05:52,779 --> 02:06:02,579
doesn't just make characters for me. He makes them for himself and he does like summoning courses

706
02:06:02,579 --> 02:06:07,300
and stuff and I don't know. I don't know what his daily life is like. I just know that sometimes

707
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:13,960
I bring him on to make characters. This really weird guy, but he's does, he's good at what he

708
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:43,270
does. All right. I'm almost ready to do the really dirty one. Why are all of his characters a version

709
02:06:43,270 --> 02:07:09,479
of me? Well, cause I don't know. Sometimes I don't feel like fucking streaming and I don't know.

710
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:12,840
He's been making different like characters and different stuff.

711
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:20,819
He has like whatever he has. He makes it however he does it. I don't know. I don't know.

712
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:26,819
You think I've watched bugleberry streams? Are you out of your fucking mind? Those streams are

713
02:07:26,819 --> 02:07:33,319
horrible. I always leave when he comes on. Why do you think I've watched a bugleberry stream?

714
02:07:33,319 --> 02:07:53,930
It's bizarre that you have. Yeah. If I know he's going to be on, I'll just like

715
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:56,890
go to the bathroom or something or make some food or just come back and see when he's gone.

716
02:07:58,869 --> 02:08:02,869
He's a smart guy. He's a, he's an interesting guy, but I just don't want to watch him stream.

717
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:26,979
Oh, this is going to be horrible. Look at, look at all these crevices. I think I can do the big

718
02:08:26,979 --> 02:08:45,210
one for this one, right? Nope. God damn it. Green one? Yeah. Why does he stream? Because like I've

719
02:08:45,210 --> 02:08:50,300
told him a long time ago that he could do stuff on camera if he wanted to. And part of me hiring

720
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:54,220
him required that he was going to be able to participate in some of the streams that I do.

721
02:08:55,180 --> 02:09:10,539
Where some of the broadcasting hours, right? What was the charity that bugleberry donated to?

722
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:18,699
Uh, that's actually a work in progress. I'll let you guys know exactly the exact amount and what

723
02:09:18,699 --> 02:09:58,380
charity it is. But no, I'm not, you'll hear about that soon. You're going to pocket it? I'm not

724
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:04,619
going to pocket it. No, I'm not going to do that. I'll, I'll give you the very specifics on all that

725
02:10:04,619 --> 02:10:12,220
stuff. I'm not just going to be like, yay. Donated it to charity. Yep. That, yeah, I did. No, I'm not

726
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:26,939
going to do that. I'll give you guys exact specifics of what it is. What just happened?

727
02:10:26,939 --> 02:10:31,159
Why did it clean it for me? I had like a whole section left. What did it do that for?

728
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:56,899
Wait, what? Free cleaning. Yeah. That doesn't mean cool. What's on this roof that's so,

729
02:10:57,539 --> 02:11:44,949
where is it? Doghouse roof. Where? Come on. Ah, thank God. Did I get the rest of the doghouse?

730
02:11:44,949 --> 02:12:02,359
I think I did, yeah. Use eagle vision. I keep forgetting I have that. No, don't spray that.

731
02:12:02,439 --> 02:12:25,289
Stop. Somebody said I hate this game. Why? This is awesome. This is super relaxing. We hate games

732
02:12:25,289 --> 02:12:32,760
now? Well, you're probably going to hate them even more when the Ubisoft conference happens.

733
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:45,000
That was uncalled for, uncalled for. Why did it do that? That was uncalled for. That was uncalled

734
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,399
for. I don't, why did I say that? I think it's because I hated Watch Dogs Legion so much

735
02:12:50,199 --> 02:13:00,310
that I just had to say that. He hates Ubisoft? Yes, I do. Do you want me to, should I just pretend

736
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:09,399
like I don't? I do. But that's like, that's a very strong way to word it. I don't hate Ubisoft.

737
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:16,939
I just hate all their games. No, let me try that again. I don't, I just don't really like their

738
02:13:16,939 --> 02:13:36,949
games. Okay. I've had fun with some of their games. Some of them. But for the most part,

739
02:13:36,949 --> 02:13:44,489
when an Ubisoft title comes out, I just go, no, I don't care. I just, I don't, it doesn't do it

740
02:13:44,489 --> 02:14:06,789
for me. Hate is too strong of a word though, because I really don't. All right, I want to get

741
02:14:06,789 --> 02:14:20,789
right to the middle. Feels good. All right. Wait, I forgot these. This will take 10 minutes? Yeah,

742
02:14:20,789 --> 02:14:30,569
but I'm, I'm being thorough. I'm being very thorough. I don't just wanna, I just yawned.

743
02:14:31,939 --> 02:14:38,779
I tried to hide it. I think that's from the headache though. That's not because I'm tired,

744
02:14:38,779 --> 02:14:42,779
or I'm bored. That's from the headache. You know when you get like a really yawny headache?

745
02:14:44,010 --> 02:15:01,800
That's what it is. I swear to God, I'm not bored. I love this so much. I just have a little migraine.

746
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:10,060
It's starting to evolve into a big migraine, which is annoying, but I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

747
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:23,739
I'll be good. Too much CBD? I have not taken any CBD today. Or yesterday, or the day before,

748
02:15:23,739 --> 02:16:00,539
or the day before, or the day before. Oh Jesus. Bong water? I don't smoke out of a bong. I don't

749
02:16:00,539 --> 02:16:25,399
smoke weed. I don't smoke weed. I don't. I got four stars already. Damn, this is dirty. It's

750
02:16:25,399 --> 02:17:04,100
one dollar for the car seat? Are you kidding me? So many cracks. Get the majority and it'll auto

751
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:33,930
complete? Oh, still dirty. No, spin it. It does do that, doesn't it? It does, doesn't it? Okay,

752
02:17:33,930 --> 02:17:51,530
cool. Final thing is, oh, the shed. Drink lots of water? Yeah, I got water right here. Somebody

753
02:17:51,530 --> 02:18:03,379
said, have I ever unironically, not joking, smoked crack? I have not unironically smoked crack. How

754
02:18:03,379 --> 02:18:12,790
do you, how do you ironically smoke crack? What are you talking about? Have you ever unironically

755
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:47,049
smoked crack? All right, shed door, shed roof. How did I not get that? If you ever smoked crack,

756
02:18:47,049 --> 02:18:53,209
I would unsub. I not, don't worry about, I'm not going to smoke crack. Dude, what are you talking

757
02:18:53,209 --> 02:19:07,020
about? Don't worry about that. Why would I ever tell you I smoked crack? That's not something that

758
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:11,510
I would just start with one day. Hey, what's up, guys? Yeah, starting to stream. We're going to

759
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:45,180
be playing Fable 3 today. I smoked crack today. Unironically, like I did it today. Unsub. Smoke

760
02:19:45,180 --> 02:20:05,370
crack or I will unsub. I can't, I can't believe it. Okay, I'm going to move on. I'm done with that.

761
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:48,620
Do you have any fuel? I got one right here. Oh, shit. Very, very nice. I'll get the caked on sugar,

762
02:20:48,620 --> 02:21:05,459
the burnt sugar. Very good. Very good. I think this is done. It is. That's it. We just have this spot

763
02:21:05,459 --> 02:21:35,559
over here. I'm going to go thin nozzle. The swing, I'll get it in a minute. I fucked it up. It's

764
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:56,340
all right. I got it. Yes. I thought this is not a fire pit. This is a pool. This is a dirty fucking

765
02:21:56,340 --> 02:22:29,430
pool. I'm going to stop swearing for an hour. It looks like chocolate. What's the max price for

766
02:22:29,430 --> 02:23:03,750
this one? 400, 500. Oh, right to the very end. Oh, yes. Look at how much better this looks.

767
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:38,950
Am I, what am I missing? 99. The grill. Oh shit. They're at the back of the grill. This thing too.

768
02:23:38,950 --> 02:24:56,120
How do I get up there? Oh, all right. 375. What? Okay. Bird house. What's left? Four. I don't see

769
02:24:56,120 --> 02:25:36,280
anything. Checklist is in the menu. Okay. Status. Okay. There's one fence post. Is it? Fence post.

770
02:25:36,280 --> 02:26:11,819
Which one? Oh, I got it. $485. Oh, let's see. Pretty cool. Do it again. Nice. Clean the dirt bike.

771
02:26:11,819 --> 02:26:16,149
Should I buy something? This one would probably be quick. All right. This is going to be quick.

772
02:26:16,149 --> 02:26:34,979
I love these quick jobs. There's so much fun. It just feels so right. You know what I mean?

773
02:26:34,979 --> 02:26:55,819
We do one pass with the wide. We come down to the green. Pass with the green. Let me change the

774
02:26:55,819 --> 02:27:20,600
yellow. This will be quick and efficient. All right. Nice. Other side. What's wrong with the

775
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:54,420
nozzle? The nozzle's like broken. All right. Now we do detail and that's it. The tires. Get in there.

776
02:27:54,420 --> 02:28:30,549
Does distance matter? I think it does. Is that tire? Oh, underneath here. Yes. Yes. Four. Four.

777
02:28:30,549 --> 02:29:14,579
Four. Squeaky clean. Come on. 96%. What's left? Oh, over here. Why am I shooting over there? Okay.

778
02:29:14,579 --> 02:29:41,510
I think it's just the front of the bike. The engine. All right. 99%. Just a little bit in the guts.

779
02:29:42,069 --> 02:30:07,930
No. Where the hell is it? Find out. The exhaust, the fairings, and the brake discs. Okay. Oh, what?

780
02:30:07,930 --> 02:30:43,420
Brake discs? What's back here? Are they not clean? How are they not clean? What is a brake disc?

781
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:58,069
Yeah, it is. Yeah, I got it. It's those. That was quick and easy. Seventy-five dollars.

782
02:30:58,069 --> 02:31:22,840
Ooh. Clean the playground. Clean the bungalow. Playground. Wait. 1250 bucks. Long extension.

783
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:50,899
Ooh. Soap. Urban X U2 turbo. Primus to 3000 turbo nozzle. Improves the range.

784
02:31:50,899 --> 02:32:03,850
Shit. I bought the wrong soap one. All right. Go back. Back. Back. All right.

785
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:12,069
Cleaning liquid. I already have the multi-surface. All right. Let's go.

786
02:32:12,069 --> 02:32:34,309
Need to reload the soap. All right. Let's see what I got. What do I got? I have the

787
02:32:35,590 --> 02:32:50,469
this nozzle. Let me check this one. Oh, no. Where is it? Zero degree nozzle. Did I not get the...

788
02:32:50,469 --> 02:33:08,649
Where is it? Where is it? Bottom left. Well, that's the soap. Didn't I buy a new nozzle?

789
02:33:08,649 --> 02:33:24,870
Oh, jeez. Look at this. Whoa. Holy shit. Okay. Hold on. I don't want to fuck this up.

790
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:58,100
What's the dirtiest thing here? Soap the absolute hell out of this. Is this doing anything?

791
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:48,440
Again? Oh, it is. Okay. Rinse it with water. That works pretty good. Use the wood soap.

792
02:34:48,440 --> 02:35:02,329
Oh, stone cleaner. Is this stone? What do you mean dirty? Oh, this is all-purpose. It's fine.

793
02:35:02,329 --> 02:35:48,139
I gotta get up here. Is the soap actually doing anything worthwhile? I ran out of soap. No,

794
02:35:48,139 --> 02:36:06,409
I didn't. I took it off. Soap is expensive. I mean, the universal soap will work on anything.

795
02:36:06,409 --> 02:36:29,579
Is that working? It is. All right. I'll put that back on. Just spray the hell out of this whole

796
02:36:29,579 --> 02:37:03,479
thing and then we'll rinse it. Wait, is this $15 every time it goes to zero? Is it? Let me

797
02:37:03,479 --> 02:37:35,239
double check. Oh, fuck that. Yeah. I'm not using this anymore. Go down the slide. Yay. All right.

798
02:37:35,239 --> 02:38:02,100
Now bring out the wash. Yeah. And let's wash. What? 8%? What? It should be higher than that.

799
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:19,319
Because all I did was use soap. Stop pretending. What are you talking about? What? What are you

800
02:38:19,319 --> 02:39:03,930
talking about? What am I pretending? Not bad. Play some music. Uh, yeah. What should we put on?

801
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:40,389
What do you guys want to hear? How about the one that goes? Uh, let's see. What can I put on?

802
02:39:40,389 --> 02:39:52,979
Put on. No, not doom. Something relaxing. Something we can just chill with.

803
02:39:52,979 --> 02:40:11,209
Supermarket sweep. Yeah, that sounds good. Ow, my fucking head. That hurts so bad. My volume is

804
02:40:11,209 --> 02:40:48,969
maxed. For you guys, that was 40% softer than what I heard. Supermarket sweep. Sounds like every

805
02:40:48,969 --> 02:41:09,059
first Sonic level after 2005. Something's auto playing. I don't know what it is.

806
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:21,659
Here we go. It's the supermarket sweep main theme. Didn't we already do this like fucking

807
02:41:22,299 --> 02:41:41,719
two or three years ago? Yeah. I remember this. We already did this. It's a clean in here if I can.

808
02:41:53,049 --> 02:41:55,850
Same joke, Andy. No, it's been three years. That means we can do it again.

809
02:41:55,850 --> 02:42:33,989
Mario Kart. It is. It is Mario Kart. It's so grimy. Super Mario Kart shop. Super Mario

810
02:42:33,989 --> 02:42:37,190
shopping shop. I can't even fucking say your joke. It was funny when you said it, not me.

811
02:42:38,069 --> 02:43:11,000
Fuck. Go faster. Oh, I'm trying. I can't go faster. Go faster. I said you do a shitty rush job.

812
02:43:11,639 --> 02:43:41,659
I don't want to do a shitty rush job. That was a bad voice crack. That was supposed to be ding,

813
02:43:42,940 --> 02:44:21,659
not ding. Look at all this crap. I wonder what are we going to get? What era of

814
02:44:21,659 --> 02:44:52,299
supermarket sweep theme song are we going to get? Wheel of Fortune, actually. JRPG music. Yeah,

815
02:44:52,299 --> 02:45:26,120
it is. Is this shit copyright? It probably is. These songs are probably copyright. Yeah,

816
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:41,049
this shit's copyright. I got to get rid of this. That was efficient what I was just doing. Very

817
02:45:41,049 --> 02:46:02,540
efficient. All right, what's next? I'm going to skip like five times. I don't know what this is.

818
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:17,700
This is fucking awesome, whatever this is. What is this? This is called the savers?

819
02:46:21,989 --> 02:46:33,270
Is this super? No, this is not a supermarket thing. This is great. What's next? Skip, skip, skip, skip,

820
02:46:33,270 --> 02:46:43,379
skip, skip, skip, skip. All right, let's go to something else. That was cool.

821
02:46:44,100 --> 02:47:22,659
Penis music. I'll do penis music for 10 seconds, okay? Okay, turn it off before I fucking puke.

822
02:47:30,549 --> 02:47:46,940
What's next? Speedrun? What's good speedrunning music? Son of the Mask. I just want, I don't care.

823
02:47:46,940 --> 02:47:53,290
I just want to play the... I have to do it. I have to. Nobody, just plug your ears for a second.

824
02:47:56,120 --> 02:48:06,360
I just have to hear that one second. I don't care. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my

825
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:19,610
eyes off of you. It's the only part I want to hear, is it? That's it. That's all I wanted to see.

826
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:34,420
Okay, now what? 30 Valley? Vsauce Prime numbers. Vsauce Prime numbers. I can't believe I watched

827
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:44,889
that entire four-hour video in my sleep. No, I am not doing that. I'm not opening up that can of

828
02:48:44,889 --> 02:48:53,940
worms. I'm not just gonna have counting happen. It's a great video. Katamari? I feel like we always

829
02:48:53,940 --> 02:49:08,170
go back to Katamari. Always. All right, you want to go outside, Otto? I think Otto wants to go out.

830
02:49:08,170 --> 02:49:12,729
I will take the first break. I'll be right back. In like two minutes while we figure out what to

831
02:49:12,729 --> 02:49:20,299
play on stream. I'll be right back. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you.

832
02:49:21,020 --> 02:52:28,100
You're just too good to be true. You know I love you, babe. American Bible Challenge theme song?

833
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:43,940
I, I can't like, it's hard to find that. You know, just watch like the first, come on. There it is.

834
02:52:46,170 --> 02:52:53,819
I'm Jeff Foxworthy and this is the American Bible Challenge. Everybody just stand up. I can't wait.

835
02:52:53,819 --> 02:52:59,350
Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. And this is American Bible Challenge.

836
02:53:17,690 --> 02:53:23,129
A computer wrote that song. You know what I mean? That's like algorithmically they just made that

837
02:53:23,129 --> 02:53:28,940
song. And I think that's Jeff Foxworthy singing it. I, you guys said no. I think it is. That's

838
02:53:28,940 --> 02:53:34,379
definitely Jeff Foxworthy singing. And this is American Bible Challenge. The American Bible

839
02:53:34,459 --> 02:53:40,200
Challenge. Everybody put your hands up. It's the, it's the same person that he, it's Jeff Foxworthy

840
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:54,309
singing it. American Bible Challenge. That's, that's him doing that. It has to be. Why would it be

841
02:53:54,309 --> 02:54:08,389
anybody else? There's nobody else that could be. I love that song so much. Everybody put your hands

842
02:54:08,389 --> 02:54:20,489
up. Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. Come on and stand up. Oh shit, forgot to

843
02:54:20,489 --> 02:54:38,950
put music on. Clown car music? No. Kirby's Epic Yarn. Sure. I'll try. Kirby's Epic Yarn.

844
02:54:39,590 --> 02:54:59,739
True. Okay. All right. Oh. Oh shit. All right. I'm getting a lot of everybody put your hands up.

845
02:54:59,739 --> 02:55:13,819
Everybody just stand up vibes from this. Oh, it doesn't go, it doesn't go. All right. That

846
02:55:13,819 --> 02:55:20,469
can stay on. That's fine. Drop it a little bit. It's a little loud. I'm going to drop the sounds in

847
02:55:20,469 --> 02:55:38,409
this game too. I don't want to overpower the music. Yeah. I want to hear the stuff. Yeah.

848
02:55:38,409 --> 02:55:49,399
There we go. Turn up the water. All right. How about the water splash sounds? Let's see.

849
02:55:51,420 --> 02:56:05,299
Ah, that's still, it's way louder. That's, I think that's good. And we'll turn Kirby up.

850
02:56:05,299 --> 02:56:10,540
That's a good audio level. Jerma doesn't know audio. Jerma's so bad at audio. Jerma's audio,

851
02:56:10,540 --> 02:56:12,940
fucking sucks. Jerma's audio is fucking terrible. I don't like everything. If I go to Jerma's

852
02:56:12,940 --> 02:56:28,100
straight, it sounds like shit. I'm working. I'm working on it. I'm trying. I wasn't an audio guy.

853
02:56:28,100 --> 02:56:34,420
I was the, I was the visual guy. I can't do everything. I can't do audio and visual. I

854
02:56:34,420 --> 02:56:48,219
can do visual and make the visual look all right. Is this replaying? All right. That's good. Let's

855
02:56:48,219 --> 02:56:57,370
go. Everybody just stand up. Everybody put your hands up. All right. Let's clean the dinosaur.

856
02:56:58,250 --> 02:57:14,620
I want to soak the fuck out of this. What the hell was that? Oh, I didn't like that. Did I do that?

857
02:57:14,620 --> 02:57:25,450
What happened? What the fuck was that? Someone just dropped something on the piano. Is that in

858
02:57:25,450 --> 02:57:53,049
the song? That's better. I didn't play this game. I didn't play any of the yarn games. They made

859
02:57:53,049 --> 02:58:13,799
like three of them. Gotta go more than that. Let's just go yellow. Make sure we get it all.

860
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:23,719
Play them all? No, I don't think so. I think they mean they're cool and everything, but no,

861
02:58:23,719 --> 02:58:41,670
I don't think so. You know why I don't want to play those games? Because if in the event that

862
02:58:41,670 --> 02:58:48,090
I don't like them or I'm just like, eh, I don't want to sour how I feel about the way they look.

863
02:58:48,729 --> 02:58:53,239
Is it the games or is it just like, eh, if I'm not into the game,

864
02:58:54,260 --> 02:58:57,059
I don't want there to be a scenario where I talk a bunch of shit about it and I talk about how the

865
02:58:57,059 --> 02:59:23,909
game sucks. I'd rather just enjoy it from afar. Nice and clean. All right. Looking good. Somebody

866
02:59:23,909 --> 02:59:32,149
mentioned speed running. I can't wait to see people speed run this game. Right? I feel like

867
02:59:32,149 --> 02:59:49,420
if you want a challenge, this is, this is, this would be very hard to speed run. Cool. Resident

868
02:59:49,420 --> 03:00:18,899
sleeper. All right. Come on. My stairs look good. Doing it in one pass feels great. All right.

869
03:00:18,899 --> 03:00:40,489
What's next on Kirby's epic yarn? Oh, I'm done with this one. I'm skipping ahead. All right.

870
03:00:40,489 --> 03:01:04,200
Okay. This is same OST. What did I do? What just happened? What happened? Where am I? What? I feel

871
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:10,760
like this one's going to be quick. All right. Let's see how fast I can do this one. Start timing.

872
03:01:12,360 --> 03:01:25,700
10 minutes from right now and I'm done. Oh, this is pretty thick dirt.

873
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:54,069
I think I need upgrades for this one. I might be able to get it. Shit. I gotta keep it in the

874
03:01:54,069 --> 03:02:16,020
right spot. I gotta be like a 3d printing machine. Come on. I clean the rest of that shit up later.

875
03:02:16,020 --> 03:03:04,459
It's all right. Oh, come on. It's still so dirty. How did I miss that much? I need a better washer.

876
03:03:04,459 --> 03:03:27,979
Yes, I do. I'll get it after this though. Kirby's epic yarn. Yeah, that's was requested. We do

877
03:03:27,979 --> 03:03:45,979
soundtrack nights like right now and you'll get what you want eventually. Got it. All right. Oh,

878
03:03:46,299 --> 03:03:54,709
boy. It's a lot. All right. I need to get on the roof up and down or left and right up and down.

879
03:03:54,709 --> 03:04:35,129
This is some kid shit. This is some kid shit. I hope this is relaxing. This is supposed to be a

880
03:04:35,129 --> 03:04:44,260
relaxing stream. While you're on the couch, just open one eye and then you'll see, oh, where is he

881
03:04:44,260 --> 03:05:03,059
now? Oh, he's doing the garage door and then just go back to bed. I'm being pretty meticulous. I'm

882
03:05:03,059 --> 03:05:32,040
already at 13%. This is good. What did I say? 10 minutes. How long has it been? Three and four.

883
03:05:32,040 --> 03:06:09,850
Okay, I'm getting there. Hey, get on here. Hey, hey, please play Super Paper Mario. Oh, you know

884
03:06:09,850 --> 03:06:15,930
what? You know what? That person's right because I'm never going to play Super Paper Mario on the

885
03:06:15,930 --> 03:06:39,850
stream. I'll put the Super Paper Mario OST on the stream. That's fair, right? I think that's fair.

886
03:06:47,829 --> 03:07:08,149
That one's good. Over here. Yep. That's just ready. See, I like this one. This one's simple.

887
03:07:08,149 --> 03:07:46,139
It's a big cube. Oh, that's much better. I got to get closer though. How much is left?

888
03:07:46,940 --> 03:08:00,889
That's way too much. Play the Among Us theme song with them and it goes

889
03:08:23,350 --> 03:08:30,229
Yes, that one. I just did it. I don't need to put it on. People still play Among Us.

890
03:08:30,229 --> 03:08:47,899
Or is it over yet? Is it a dead game? I don't, it's probably, I don't think it's a dead game.

891
03:08:48,459 --> 03:09:12,360
It's really popular still. Play Persona 5. I don't want to, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to

892
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:25,290
get on the roof. Can I turn this clown music? Oh, this is Mario Party. I don't know. What game is it?

893
03:09:25,930 --> 03:09:38,389
I'm not going to play Persona. That's like a 60 hour game. You're never going to see a game

894
03:09:38,389 --> 03:09:44,700
on this stream that's more than 20 hours. Top. I stream once a week, twice a week sometimes.

895
03:09:44,700 --> 03:10:14,520
It's not going to happen. I have to be honest. I have to be real. 21, almost there. Oh, what's this

896
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:45,340
song? The green one, I don't have, there's no use for the green one. It's either the white or the

897
03:10:45,340 --> 03:11:17,700
yellow. The green one sucks. I want to use the soap. Oh, that's so good here. Holy shit. That's

898
03:11:17,700 --> 03:11:46,979
so good here. Wow. All right. That's good. Soap the hell out of the whole house and then I'll rinse

899
03:11:46,979 --> 03:12:36,569
it. Time's up. It's been 10 minutes. Oh shit. Oh well. Got to go green. Stone cleaner. Oh shit.

900
03:12:36,569 --> 03:12:46,090
All right. They're good. I can't tell this is, this is good, right? That's pretty, kind of good.

901
03:12:46,090 --> 03:13:07,459
Let me just say play Lisa. Play Lisa. I swear to God, some of you guys have bots and come into

902
03:13:07,459 --> 03:13:18,420
this channel and just write that. It's probably at least two or three accounts at once every month.

903
03:13:19,879 --> 03:13:51,350
Just paste it. Let's just set up as an algorithm. Is this stone? Turn the webcam on. No,

904
03:13:51,909 --> 03:13:56,090
I'm not a webcam streamer. I'm a web, no, I'm a webcam streamer with an asterisk.

905
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:14,700
Only when it makes sense. It doesn't have to be on all the time. Nice. Makes sense right now. No,

906
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:35,739
it doesn't. Please. I would love a webcam. No, I like this song. Let's see how it goes.

907
03:14:36,299 --> 03:15:07,530
How can he be so mean when playing his dream game? I just don't want to put a webcam on.

908
03:15:07,530 --> 03:15:43,340
Stop fucking asking for it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, I know. 50% of this whole place is a roof.

909
03:15:43,340 --> 03:16:00,969
Oh Jesus. Are you kidding me? It's a ladder. Hey, Rick and Morty season four coming up.

910
03:16:00,969 --> 03:16:29,159
Saw the trailer. Everybody else excited? So if I, this is what I understand. If all of you hate

911
03:16:29,159 --> 03:16:46,459
this show, who's watching the show? You know what I'm saying? Redditors? But aren't redditors,

912
03:16:47,979 --> 03:16:55,719
what? I don't know. Wait, so what are you guys? What are you guys? Are you twitchers?

913
03:16:56,440 --> 03:17:14,409
Twitch viewers? What? Neck beards. So if you guys aren't redditors, do you guys

914
03:17:14,409 --> 03:17:29,819
only hang around on Twitch? I don't buy that. I don't buy that. Who's your favorite Twitch?

915
03:17:29,819 --> 03:17:35,209
I can't even talk. Who's your favorite Twitch streamer then? You like Twitch so much. Who's

916
03:17:35,209 --> 03:17:57,530
your favorite streamer? Okay. Okay. There's too much going on on this one. Yep. That's better.

917
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:16,500
You're a fan of Twitch. Name every Twitch streamer. That's what I'm saying. All right.

918
03:18:16,500 --> 03:18:41,379
44%. Let's go with this guy. Let's do a quick coding. Let me get the power. Door is going to

919
03:18:41,379 --> 03:19:04,340
be done. Door is going to be done. Okay. Cool. Yes. Yes. Yes. Please play the Pikachu soundtrack.

920
03:19:04,899 --> 03:19:55,110
Pikachu has his own soundtrack. Yes. Yes. Yes. I think it's just a roof down here a little.

921
03:19:55,110 --> 03:20:23,370
All right. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. He's still dirty,

922
03:20:23,370 --> 03:21:08,549
but on Nier Automata. Nier Automata. Oh, shit. All right. This is good. This is Nier. This

923
03:21:08,549 --> 03:21:25,899
sounds good. Oh, wait, wait. Hold on. Sorry. Nier Automata. Nier Automata full OST.

924
03:21:37,180 --> 03:22:14,709
Nier gets copyright strikes from YouTube. Oh, well. Something else. What's next? How about...

925
03:22:14,709 --> 03:22:22,379
It's been 20 minutes. You're still not done. Yeah, but this is, this is flowing.

926
03:22:22,379 --> 03:22:27,260
Play Lisa. Play Lisa the Painful. You should play Lisa the Painful. You should play Lisa the

927
03:22:27,260 --> 03:22:34,440
Painful and just stream it. It should be like a exclamation point Lisa that just says I will

928
03:22:34,440 --> 03:22:50,620
never play Lisa the Painful. But then I can put it in when the bots put it in. Pokemon? Yeah,

929
03:22:50,620 --> 03:22:59,510
Pokemon battle music. That sounds good to me. Pokemon hype mix battle music. Get hyped with

930
03:22:59,510 --> 03:23:16,260
this compilation of some of the best battle songs from the Pokemon OST. It's pretty, I, I, I get it.

931
03:23:16,260 --> 03:23:56,569
Here we go. Is this in the... Okay, this is not in Pokemon. This song is not in Pokemon.

932
03:23:56,569 --> 03:24:08,090
This is somebody remixed it. This is that song that goes...

933
03:24:14,329 --> 03:24:22,790
This is a, uh, what is it? Chemical, the Chemical Brothers? No, who is it?

934
03:24:40,569 --> 03:24:49,290
That's this song. Firestarter, right? There it is. I'm a firestarter. Mr. Firestarter.

935
03:24:58,309 --> 03:25:28,100
Prodigy, yeah, all right. This is not in Pokemon. I know that for a fact. This is literally Pokemon.

936
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:54,889
I don't believe you. This is from Gen 8. I don't like this. This, this, this is not...

937
03:25:54,889 --> 03:26:06,700
This is the only kind of Pokemon music I like. I don't like new things. I don't like new things,

938
03:26:06,700 --> 03:27:06,200
like old things from 1995. This is not even in Pokemon. Oh, where is it? Where's the one I like?

939
03:27:06,200 --> 03:27:29,049
Oh, where's the one that I like? This is not the Hedgehog. I like this though. I just hear

940
03:27:29,049 --> 03:27:49,590
the blast processing sound. It's gonna be too hard to get these. All right, I can do this.

941
03:27:49,590 --> 03:28:14,219
Yeah, this is awesome. I really like this one a lot. This thing sucks. I need a better nozzle.

942
03:28:17,020 --> 03:28:44,940
I feel like I can beat this level. All right, this is almost... Come on, it's done. Give it to me.

943
03:28:50,540 --> 03:29:13,350
Where'd it go? Oh, whatever. I'm going up. No, no, no. I want... I mean, this is... This playlist is

944
03:29:13,350 --> 03:29:42,100
cool. Here we go. Yep, this is it. This is exactly what I was looking for. That's not... No, that's not

945
03:29:42,100 --> 03:30:18,629
it. Not it. Is this it? No, I want the one from Brawl. What's the one from Brawl? Gen 2? Is it?

946
03:30:18,629 --> 03:31:01,979
I think this is it. Fake Andy. What? Brawl soundtrack is fire. The Brawl soundtrack is

947
03:31:01,979 --> 03:31:09,879
way better than all the other Smash Brothers soundtracks. It is equivocally the best one

948
03:31:09,879 --> 03:31:22,340
they've ever made. I... Nothing compares. It was so much better than everything else. Say what you...

949
03:31:22,340 --> 03:31:27,500
Brawl... You might think Brawl sucks, but the music in Brawl was totally better than anything

950
03:31:27,500 --> 03:31:42,010
else they've ever done. If all... Oh, fuck that. Let's just put on the Brawl OST. Fuck that.

951
03:31:42,729 --> 03:31:53,110
That's the one I want to hear. Do you remember this one when you were... Remember when you heard

952
03:31:53,110 --> 03:32:19,030
this? This one was the... This is one of the best songs in the whole soundtrack. Calm down, man.

953
03:32:21,430 --> 03:32:49,159
I don't think I timed out for one minute. This is a perfect soundtrack for what we're doing.

954
03:32:49,159 --> 03:32:54,500
Just to... This is a coloring book. This is a pro tip for all you guys that have trouble coloring

955
03:32:54,500 --> 03:33:02,579
books. Always fill in the edges first so then you can't color outside the lines. Go a half

956
03:33:02,579 --> 03:33:21,700
inch around so then that's your new line so you'll never color outside the lines. You're going so

957
03:33:21,700 --> 03:33:31,620
slow. Oh, I... What are you... I'm not going slow, right? I mean, I am right now because I'm trying... I

958
03:33:31,620 --> 03:34:01,620
can't move that fast for some reason on the roof. It's another good one. Don't fall. I won't. I'm

959
03:34:01,620 --> 03:34:09,450
good. All right. Now we colored inside the lines. Now we go like this. I can probably do green for

960
03:34:09,450 --> 03:34:27,450
this one. You know what's funny? This would probably be the background music for this video.

961
03:34:27,450 --> 03:34:35,420
If I was going to have this on YouTube and I'm like a power washing guy channel, this is probably

962
03:34:35,420 --> 03:35:13,239
what it would be. Do soap on the roof. Oh shit. That's good. Another classic. Another one. Every

963
03:35:13,239 --> 03:35:20,389
single song on the Brawl... Can I... Why do I... Whatever. Every single soundtrack on the... Oh my

964
03:35:20,389 --> 03:35:28,180
God. Every single... The song is speech jamming me. Every single song on the Brawl soundtrack

965
03:35:28,180 --> 03:35:36,860
was good. I never skipped one of them. They were all good.

966
03:36:02,700 --> 03:36:24,420
All right. We're at 69%. Everybody yellow L real quick. This is like a weird SpongeBob Mario

967
03:36:24,420 --> 03:37:03,129
mashup. Oh my fucking God. Stop. No swearing. Imagine all the junk that would be in there.

968
03:37:03,129 --> 03:37:39,100
Get it. Oh, whatever. Why am I missing on this roof? Oh, it's so dirty. Filthy over here.

969
03:37:39,659 --> 03:38:19,370
Is that Wario? I think it's Wario. Is it... Am I going fast enough for you now? That's a better speed,

970
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:32,500
don't you think? Soap? I don't need it. I'll use soap when I get the better nozzle. I'm still

971
03:38:32,500 --> 03:38:54,280
using the original power washer. This thing kind of sucks. Really need 1200? How many... There's a

972
03:38:54,360 --> 03:39:10,020
lot of Mario songs on the Brawl track, aren't there? I didn't realize there were this many.

973
03:39:10,020 --> 03:39:30,760
S1? Yeah, this is really good too. 74%. Come on. Come on. You know what I'm... Come on. Say it.

974
03:39:30,760 --> 03:39:41,399
Come on. Come on. That's when I hold the microphone out to the audience and everyone goes,

975
03:39:42,280 --> 03:39:57,350
when? We kind of wanted to make a fake advertisement for like a comedy DVD or comedy CD.

976
03:39:59,500 --> 03:40:04,139
And there's a huge audience and it's like the announcer guy, the infomercial guy is like it

977
03:40:04,139 --> 03:40:10,469
and such antics as. It's this little routine of little stream jokes. Like an audience.

978
03:40:11,190 --> 03:40:21,930
Just make a little infomercial of a fake CD that doesn't exist. Relive all those classic moments.

979
03:40:22,489 --> 03:40:27,719
Like, come on, Gwyn. Oh, come on. Come on, Gwyn. And everybody's fucking is cackling in the

980
03:40:27,719 --> 03:40:43,750
audience. And they also brought like the vault. We got access to the German 95 vault

981
03:40:45,340 --> 03:41:06,489
after his estate got it. Yeah, like they got access to my vault. Wait, am I supposed to be dead?

982
03:41:08,729 --> 03:41:42,379
Shit, yeah. Fuck, I didn't want to fall off. Clean, clean, clean. This is going to be a huge

983
03:41:42,379 --> 03:42:17,930
chunk. This roof. How about, was it 80%? Somebody get this guy a harness. You're not safe from a

984
03:42:17,930 --> 03:42:27,159
fall joke even in this game. No, you're not. You're always at risk to hear a fall joke. I see a fall

985
03:42:27,159 --> 03:42:54,600
joke no matter what we're doing. Oh fuck, whatever. That tree has a smile. The tree is fucking laughing

986
03:42:54,600 --> 03:43:24,500
at me right there. I didn't even do any of this. All right, let's do this. I'll finish with the

987
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:32,819
roof. What about like dinosaur playground place? Can I go back and do that again? Hopefully it's

988
03:43:32,819 --> 03:43:55,770
not reset. That would be really annoying if it was. What's this from? Mario's way cooler than Mickey

989
03:43:55,770 --> 03:44:04,229
Mouse. I'm sorry. If you want to have the thing that is just the universal, everybody loves it.

990
03:44:04,229 --> 03:44:11,940
Everyone. It's Super Mario. Like it's not Mickey Mouse. Fuck that guy. Donald Duck is way better

991
03:44:11,940 --> 03:44:33,770
anyways. I can't think of anything. When you hear the word Super Mario, you don't think, all you

992
03:44:33,770 --> 03:44:39,879
think about is, oh that's, I feel very happy right now. I feel at peace for just a moment. Even just

993
03:44:39,879 --> 03:44:50,219
a moment. When you hear Mickey Mouse, you also feel some joy for a moment. Mickey Mouse. Oh,

994
03:44:50,940 --> 03:44:58,379
Mickey Mouse. And then you realize it's four dollars for a water at Disney. And it's, yep,

995
03:44:59,340 --> 03:45:21,049
it gets a little sour in your mouth for a second. Because it must be on sale.

996
03:45:21,850 --> 03:45:28,379
How much is a bottle of water at like Disneyland? Does anybody know? Just like a Dasani bottle of

997
03:45:28,379 --> 03:45:45,670
water. Is it five bucks? Is it four bucks? Probably five bucks. Yeah, it probably is.

998
03:45:46,309 --> 03:46:10,549
3.75, 3.50. Let's go to a water fountain. So when does the copyright run out for Mickey Mouse?

999
03:46:11,110 --> 03:46:18,059
You guys know that that's happening, right? I wonder what they're going to do about that.

1000
03:46:21,879 --> 03:46:26,600
Your local car dealership is going to be able to have Mickey Mouse pop up and be like,

1001
03:46:26,600 --> 03:46:34,329
oh yes, I love Dave's Toyota. Or whatever it is. Can you imagine when the copyright runs out,

1002
03:46:34,329 --> 03:46:37,930
how many fucking commercials are going to be showing up with Mickey Mouse on them?

1003
03:46:37,930 --> 03:46:43,430
It'll be every commercial. Every other commercial, once that copyright runs out,

1004
03:46:43,430 --> 03:46:50,420
will have Mickey Mouse in it. He'll be in Olive Garden commercials, he'll be in every local,

1005
03:46:50,420 --> 03:46:55,459
every single local commercial you've ever seen will have him in it. It's going to be so annoying.

1006
03:46:55,860 --> 03:47:19,139
Mickey Mouse is going to be endorsing so many products. Think of the oversaturation though.

1007
03:47:19,139 --> 03:47:23,270
If you watch an Olive Garden commercial and Mickey Mouse is there and then your local

1008
03:47:23,270 --> 03:47:28,069
Toyota is Mickey Mouse and then a toothpaste commercial has Mickey Mouse in it,

1009
03:47:28,709 --> 03:47:47,959
it's going to be crazy for a while. 2024. Yeah, when is it actually supposed to happen?

1010
03:47:47,959 --> 03:47:54,540
They're never going to let that happen. No way. I would be really surprised if it actually did

1011
03:47:54,540 --> 03:48:14,540
happen. 2024. No way. Think of every virus website. That is a banner ad that will just have Mickey

1012
03:48:14,540 --> 03:48:20,620
Mouse doing the standing sideways with his arms up, with his hands pointing towards the banner.

1013
03:48:24,569 --> 03:48:38,780
People are going to click it because it's Mickey Mouse. It'll just say the magic of Mickey Mouse.

1014
03:48:39,579 --> 03:48:44,940
Come over to, I don't know, whatever it is, whatever virus website it is, whatever scam it is.

1015
03:48:53,209 --> 03:48:58,700
They've already, hold on, let me pause this. They've already bought themselves more time.

1016
03:48:58,700 --> 03:49:03,739
Technically it's the Steamboat Willie Mickey and they've kind of gotten that back by reverting

1017
03:49:03,739 --> 03:49:16,180
to an older art style for some cartoons. Oh, Mickey Mouse. You think scammers care about

1018
03:49:16,180 --> 03:49:25,430
copyright? Literally nobody under 40 cares about Mickey Mouse. That's not true. Mickey Mouse Club

1019
03:49:25,430 --> 03:49:29,989
House was one of the most popular things that anybody that was young, like nieces and nephews,

1020
03:49:29,989 --> 03:49:39,139
they watched the hell out of it. What are you talking about? That was a huge deal for at least

1021
03:49:39,139 --> 03:49:57,500
a few, a couple of years. All right, let's, I want to skip to, ooh, mother. These are good. Yeah,

1022
03:49:57,500 --> 03:50:02,760
of course you, everybody, Mickey Mouse is a big deal when you're a little kid. I could correct

1023
03:50:02,760 --> 03:50:12,520
that statement and say that anybody under 40 and over 10 maybe is correct, but I think you really

1024
03:50:12,520 --> 03:50:19,579
underestimate how powerful of a character Mickey Mouse is to young kids, especially like three,

1025
03:50:19,579 --> 03:50:35,860
two, three, four, five-year-olds. Yeah, hot dog. Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog.

1026
03:50:37,559 --> 03:50:43,799
Now we've got ears. Now we've got ears. Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggity dog. Hot dog, hot dog, hot

1027
03:50:43,799 --> 03:51:03,180
diggity dog. What's wrong? Is it not like that? Let me put the audio back up a little bit.

1028
03:51:03,180 --> 03:51:27,670
It's weird to hear no sounds. There we go, that's better. Okay, so hold on a minute. Is that the

1029
03:51:27,670 --> 03:51:32,389
whole Disney catalog of original characters or is that Mickey Mouse? Like when is Goofy up for

1030
03:51:33,030 --> 03:51:36,950
auction or whatever or whatever it is? Because they have to let, is it people gonna, somebody

1031
03:51:36,950 --> 03:51:42,360
could buy the copyright or no, it's just public domain. Imagine they auctioned off the characters.

1032
03:51:43,239 --> 03:51:48,139
Holy shit. How much do you think that would go for? How many people would be in that room?

1033
03:51:52,420 --> 03:52:07,079
Next up is the rights to Donald Duck. That place would be full of people. Oh, I love this one.

1034
03:52:07,079 --> 03:52:12,950
This is the one that goes down, down, down, down, down, down. Yeah, this is the one that goes crazy.

1035
03:52:12,950 --> 03:52:26,649
Yep. 10 minutes, by the way. What do you mean 10 minutes? Oh, that's how long I said it was

1036
03:52:26,649 --> 03:52:39,319
gonna be here for when I unplugged my thing. I still haven't replaced this. It's still broken.

1037
03:52:39,319 --> 03:52:56,819
All right, that's good. Gosh, Mickey. Who would go for the least amount of money? Between Goofy,

1038
03:52:56,819 --> 03:53:10,549
Donald and, okay, Goofy, Donald, Pluto, like Daisy. Because Minnie and Minnie are,

1039
03:53:11,590 --> 03:53:16,280
they're billion dollar characters, right? You think Pluto would go for the least? I don't know

1040
03:53:16,280 --> 03:53:36,180
about that. I think Pluto is pretty iconic. Pluto or Daisy. I guess Pluto doesn't talk.

1041
03:53:36,180 --> 03:53:45,379
So if you wanted to sell used Toyotas with Pluto, you couldn't do that. Unless they wanted to make

1042
03:53:45,379 --> 03:53:59,379
them talk. What would Pluto sound like? Goofy can talk and Pluto can't. Explain that. Because,

1043
03:53:59,379 --> 03:54:31,129
I don't know, the four of them stepped into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Ooze, and Pluto didn't. Pluto

1044
03:54:31,129 --> 03:54:38,440
would sound like a gangster? Like a 30s gangster? You mean like, come on, what do you say about that?

1045
03:54:38,440 --> 03:54:45,899
Come on now, you say? You like that? I don't know. I don't think so. No, I don't think so.

1046
03:54:53,479 --> 03:55:03,420
No, no way. He'd be, because he's lovable, dopey, funny. What would Pluto talk like? Let's see.

1047
03:55:04,059 --> 03:55:13,430
Well, think of the other talking dog that exists, right? Other talking dog. And when I say talking

1048
03:55:13,430 --> 03:55:20,739
dog, I don't mean Goofy. I don't mean dog. On all fours, dogs. Scooby-Doo, right? On all fours,

1049
03:55:20,739 --> 03:55:24,739
they're a dog. Scooby-Doo's not supposed to be like a talking character. He's a dog on all fours.

1050
03:55:28,659 --> 03:55:37,540
So Pluto would have to be in that same category, right? Pluto's not going to be like Brian Griffin.

1051
03:55:37,540 --> 03:55:44,020
Like, oh, hey, what's going on? It's me, Pluto. Yeah, I like martinis. I did that joke like a week

1052
03:55:44,020 --> 03:55:55,770
ago. I don't care. But seriously, what would Pluto would probably be more dog-like? Let me think.

1053
03:55:56,729 --> 03:56:02,489
It would be some type of range. I don't think it would be as goofball as Scooby-Doo is.

1054
03:56:05,190 --> 03:56:17,530
What other dog on all fours talks? I think it's just Scooby-Doo. It's Scooby-Doo. Astro. Oh,

1055
03:56:17,530 --> 03:56:22,729
that's right. Yeah, Astro's in that same category where he's like, oh, I love you, roach, right?

1056
03:56:24,809 --> 03:56:27,850
The dogs on all fours always talk like Goofy.

1057
03:56:28,489 --> 03:56:37,450
Oh, doggy. I love you, roach. So if we use that same exact kind of barometer for how they're

1058
03:56:37,450 --> 03:56:47,909
supposed to talk, then Pluto would be in the same category. What would he do? I feel like it would

1059
03:56:47,909 --> 03:56:56,700
be very tongue voice. Like, the tongue is always out. Like, you know what I mean? Because he's

1060
03:56:56,700 --> 03:57:01,299
always... I feel like that would be a gimmick. Like, right? It would be kind of a big... His tongue's

1061
03:57:01,299 --> 03:57:18,680
always out. And it would probably be very playful. Like, hey, hey, hey, Nicky, are you hungry?

1062
03:57:19,239 --> 03:57:53,450
Maybe something like that. I can perfect it. Fuck. There's a ladder. It would be a lot of tongue.

1063
03:57:54,250 --> 03:58:06,139
Tongue's just always hanging out. That would be the gimmick for that dog on all fours. I don't

1064
03:58:06,139 --> 03:58:13,750
think Pluto makes sense. Wait, did... What's the Garfield dog? Asteroid? What's the... No, the dog

1065
03:58:13,829 --> 03:58:22,409
from Garfield. Did he talk? Wait, he did for one episode, didn't he? Odie, right. Didn't Odie talk

1066
03:58:22,409 --> 03:58:37,219
for an episode? I swear to God, there was an episode where Odie drank like a magic potion

1067
03:58:37,219 --> 03:58:59,159
and could talk. What am I thinking of? Spike from Tom and Jerry. Hold on, Spike from Tom and Jerry

1068
03:58:59,159 --> 03:59:20,649
is not on all fours. Yeah, he's bipedal. Yeah, he's not on all fours. Yeah, he literally walks

1069
03:59:20,649 --> 03:59:28,170
on two feet. I'm talking about on all fours, you are a dog on all fours. What about Bolt? Bolt?

1070
03:59:28,889 --> 03:59:36,649
Bolt the dog. Bolt the dog talks?

1071
03:59:36,649 --> 03:59:52,100
Oh shit, he does talk.

1072
03:59:58,709 --> 04:00:07,979
Fuck, this ruins everything for me. This blows up the whole theory. Bolt doesn't have like a weird

1073
04:00:07,979 --> 04:00:12,219
thing he does, like he doesn't go like, at the end of every sentence, does he go like, or something

1074
04:00:12,219 --> 04:00:34,469
weird? This is a movie, though, and it's like a celebrity was this role, right? It doesn't,

1075
04:00:34,469 --> 04:00:58,360
it doesn't count. Beverly Hills Chihuahua? What the fuck is this?

1076
04:01:08,040 --> 04:01:10,409
Can I show this on stream? I don't think I can.

1077
04:01:20,260 --> 04:01:24,819
No, this doesn't count either. This doesn't count. I'll tell you why this doesn't count.

1078
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:31,590
Hold on. The reason why this doesn't count is because this is a real dog,

1079
04:01:32,149 --> 04:01:40,020
ha ha funny real dog that we CGI'd a mouth on. That's what makes this different. This is not the

1080
04:01:40,020 --> 04:01:59,000
same. That may, this is different because this is a CG, this is not easy to find a mate with papers.

1081
04:02:01,159 --> 04:02:02,520
Yeah, this doesn't count. This doesn't count.

1082
04:02:18,540 --> 04:02:24,940
Doesn't count because it's a, it's a, the whole gimmick of the movie is, look, it's real actors

1083
04:02:24,940 --> 04:02:31,209
and with its real dogs, but their mouths are CG'd. No, I'm talking about a created character

1084
04:02:31,209 --> 04:02:42,459
that's so, it's not a real animal. Bolt is close. Bolt, I think, ruins my theory.

1085
04:02:43,020 --> 04:03:00,600
101 Dalmatians. What? Fat Albert's dog talked? How many talked? No, no. Lady and the Tramp.

1086
04:03:01,239 --> 04:03:24,809
They talked? Wait a minute. Fuck, they did talk. Yeah, they talked a lot. But they, was it, was it

1087
04:03:24,809 --> 04:03:34,149
weird talking though? I can't, this is so dumb. Grammarly helps make your writing clear.

1088
04:03:35,610 --> 04:03:40,569
Yeah, wait till Grammarly uses Mickey Mouse. Does anybody else, okay, this, I look, I like,

1089
04:03:40,569 --> 04:03:46,329
Grammarly, I don't know how good the product is. I have no idea. It's probably awesome. I wonder,

1090
04:03:47,139 --> 04:03:52,899
right, that being said, I wonder how much money they spend on marketing because half of every ad

1091
04:03:52,899 --> 04:03:59,540
I've ever received for the last almost five straight years has been Grammarly. They must have

1092
04:03:59,540 --> 04:04:04,899
a monster marketing budget. Monster. It has to be like half the whole company's net worth.

1093
04:04:06,620 --> 04:04:18,069
Right? How would it be possible for them to show ads for this long? Right? All right, I did not,

1094
04:04:18,069 --> 04:04:29,379
what the fuck is this video that I just put in here? Am I getting a second ad? All right,

1095
04:04:29,379 --> 04:04:40,229
so anyways, let's see. Shit, they do talk, whatever.

1096
04:04:41,190 --> 04:05:00,069
Hey Joe! Did the animals talk to the people? Okay, all right, I'm not, I'm not playing anymore of

1097
04:05:00,069 --> 04:05:18,170
this. They talk, whatever. All dogs go to heaven. Yeah. What about non-movie? TV show. Movies is a

1098
04:05:18,170 --> 04:05:28,020
different story. What about TV show? Where is the cowardly dog? Yeah, but he stands up. What's,

1099
04:05:28,020 --> 04:05:38,069
what is Martha? Martha speaks. Martha speaks.

1100
04:05:38,069 --> 04:05:54,549
Shit. They all talk?

1101
04:06:00,309 --> 04:06:18,809
God damn it, whatever. Wilfred? Dog with a blog? What is dog with a blog? What is this nonsense?

1102
04:06:20,600 --> 04:06:38,389
Kids? Wait a second. I have a challenge for all of you. Okay, where is it? I need to show it. Dog

1103
04:06:38,389 --> 04:06:53,079
with a blog, Disney Channel. Wait, what? Dog with a blog, Disney Channel. Okay. Have a surprise for

1104
04:06:53,079 --> 04:07:00,120
you. All right, he's making noises. He's a rescue from the shelter. Coming soon to Disney Channel.

1105
04:07:00,120 --> 04:07:07,510
Thank you. I've always. There's just one little thing. Give me the stinking food. I'm drooling a

1106
04:07:07,510 --> 04:07:20,579
pool over here. No, but this doesn't count because he's a, he's a real dog. Wait, what do you mean

1107
04:07:20,579 --> 04:07:33,399
let mom and dad find out? They can't hear him? This is awesome. I want to watch this show. Why is

1108
04:07:33,399 --> 04:07:40,170
this reverse Santa? Disney Channel's all new comedy. Don't tell mom and dad the dog can talk. No,

1109
04:07:41,129 --> 04:07:53,940
dog. I don't understand. This looks bad. I want to watch it. October, this is from 10 years ago.

1110
04:07:53,940 --> 04:08:01,659
All right. Still, but you understand my point. Three, two dogs that have ever existed that have

1111
04:08:01,659 --> 04:08:07,500
ever been created as characters have a funny dog voice if they're on all fours. It's been two ever.

1112
04:08:08,139 --> 04:08:25,270
So, I would think Pluto would be the third. Nine years ago. That's insane. That was the turn of the

1113
04:08:25,270 --> 04:08:39,399
Disney Channel century, right? Where every show was just friends for kids. What about underdog?

1114
04:08:39,399 --> 04:08:46,950
Underdog was stood up. He stood up right and they're still doing it. I don't even know.

1115
04:08:47,670 --> 04:08:51,590
People always say, well, wow, the Disney Channel, like all those shows are suck and they're boring

1116
04:08:51,590 --> 04:08:55,030
and they're dumb and they're just soulless. Well, how can they keep making them? Somebody

1117
04:08:55,030 --> 04:09:21,700
has to be watching them. All right. Where's this? I had 2%. All right. Even the list. Oh, nice. It's

1118
04:09:21,700 --> 04:09:27,770
still there. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

1119
04:09:27,770 --> 04:09:40,889
Go back. Go back. Get out. I need details. Okay. Gutter's the porch. All right. Gutter's in the

1120
04:09:40,889 --> 04:09:53,620
porch. Over here. Does cat dog count? Um, a little, but cat dog has a funny voice. A dog is like this,

1121
04:09:53,620 --> 04:09:59,940
Ryan. And cat is like this. It's like, oh, cat dog. No, that's, that's not like a human talking.

1122
04:09:59,940 --> 04:10:21,979
That's dumb. You talk like that. I don't talk like that. Crypto the super currency.

1123
04:10:30,889 --> 04:10:39,739
Dog from Johnny test. Did he stand upright though? I feel like that he was like a person. He stood

1124
04:10:39,739 --> 04:10:58,459
upright, didn't he? We have to eliminate real dogs that have a CG mouth. That doesn't count.

1125
04:10:58,459 --> 04:11:21,540
The only one I've really seen was that Martha one that fits that category. What about Paw Patrol?

1126
04:11:21,540 --> 04:11:26,649
Yeah, but they like, they drive cars and shit. Pluto doesn't drive a car. Scooby-Doo doesn't

1127
04:11:26,649 --> 04:11:51,719
drive a car. You have to sit upright to drive a car. They fly planes and stuff. What about the

1128
04:11:51,719 --> 04:12:00,389
wonder pets? Um, you're moving the goalpost. I think the things I'm saying are very, they're valid

1129
04:12:00,389 --> 04:12:18,139
points. You log with the blog. Look at how beautiful this house looks. What about Clifford,

1130
04:12:18,139 --> 04:12:26,040
the big red dog? Um, hold on to Clifford. I always thought that he had a funny voice.

1131
04:12:42,620 --> 04:13:01,770
Shit, they all have normal voices. I just skipped the whole episode. I just want to hear Clifford

1132
04:13:01,770 --> 04:13:24,500
talk. Yeah, he's normal. Damn it. What about the live action Clifford? Your whole point has been

1133
04:13:24,500 --> 04:13:31,510
ruined. It doesn't matter. The point still stands. Pluto would not have a normal voice. Can we? Okay,

1134
04:13:32,229 --> 04:13:36,549
let's do a poll. At least give me, give me the benefit of the doubt here. Let's throw a poll

1135
04:13:36,549 --> 04:13:59,180
up. Would Pluto have a normal voice? I don't think he would. All right, let me go back to my

1136
04:13:59,180 --> 04:14:23,610
soundtrack. What was it? Brawl soundtrack. Animal Crossing sounds good. Uh, the porch fences.

1137
04:14:24,170 --> 04:14:48,739
Porch fences and gutters. None of Mickey Mouse and friends have normal voices. I think they kind of

1138
04:14:48,739 --> 04:15:08,760
do. Mickey, um, Daisy? Yeah, yes they do. Yeah, they do. They have, yeah, they're normal. They're

1139
04:15:08,760 --> 04:15:16,069
kind of normal. Like Goofy's is just like kind of a low, a very low booming voice. Like, gosh, Mickey,

1140
04:15:16,229 --> 04:15:30,309
how are you, Mickey? People talk like that. That is, how is that not normal? I just did it.

1141
04:15:32,040 --> 04:15:40,040
Oh gosh, Mickey. Oh, hey guys, it's me, Germo. I'm here, just having a swell time on my channel.

1142
04:15:40,040 --> 04:15:50,260
There are people that actually talk like that. What are you talking about? Donald is the one

1143
04:15:50,260 --> 04:16:30,069
that's not normal. No, 82%. Thank you. Oh my God, clean it already. And then the gutter is over here.

1144
04:16:30,069 --> 04:16:45,819
You just spent an hour proving nothing. Well, I sure did. I just spent an hour proving I don't

1145
04:16:45,819 --> 04:16:53,540
know very many dogs that are on all fours to talk. That's what you should took from that.

1146
04:16:57,219 --> 04:17:01,700
And guess what? Neither did you until probably 10 minutes ago.

1147
04:17:09,879 --> 04:17:22,700
We baa, we baa, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

1148
04:17:22,700 --> 04:17:44,819
Gutters, posts. Post, post, gutters. In here. All right, gotta get up.

1149
04:17:44,819 --> 04:18:04,579
We baa, we baa, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

1150
04:18:04,579 --> 04:18:39,059
Use the ladder. I just did. Is that it? No. The gutters, something over here. Come on,

1151
04:18:39,059 --> 04:19:04,139
it's one little thing. Posts and window frames. What do you mean post? Posts? What window frame?

1152
04:19:04,700 --> 04:19:49,479
Not this, right? Window frames. Which window frame? Under the frame? Tab? Yeah, it's not showing up.

1153
04:19:49,479 --> 04:20:29,510
Window frame. What? Now what? Posts. Oh my God. Come on. This game sucks. No, it doesn't. How dare

1154
04:20:29,510 --> 04:20:57,159
you. I'm furious with that person. Furious with them. This post is fine. This one's not.

1155
04:21:07,909 --> 04:21:42,600
What's the problem? Beautiful. All right, I got 710 bucks. I need 1250 for that. I could get this.

1156
04:21:42,600 --> 04:22:03,799
I'm just gonna save the money. Now I'm gonna go finish the other one. Back to the playground.

1157
04:22:03,799 --> 04:22:25,319
All right, where was I? I want new music. Oh, let's go to retro. Yep.

1158
04:22:30,170 --> 04:22:49,979
All right, let's do the big one. I can get it with this, right? Let's do soap. Why not?

1159
04:22:49,979 --> 04:23:08,790
This is multi-purpose cleaner. Waste of money. It kind of is. This is not that good.

1160
04:23:08,790 --> 04:23:29,219
Hey, this sucks. It's not worth it. Actually not worth it. This is terrible. Here we go.

1161
04:23:29,780 --> 04:23:57,590
Damn it. I keep fucking it up. Can I get it all? Why does it play one second of each one of these

1162
04:23:57,590 --> 04:24:28,020
songs? I'm already at 30% because the songs are one second long. They are? These look much longer

1163
04:24:28,020 --> 04:25:15,610
than this. Go back to Animal Crossing. No, I want lips. What's the lipstick song? They have a list

1164
04:25:15,610 --> 04:25:37,290
here. Let's see. There we go. What's it called? No, shit. It's not here. Yeah, from Panel De Pon.

1165
04:25:37,290 --> 04:26:09,819
Yeah, this is the one. This one is. This one's on fire. Play Plok? What happened to this game?

1166
04:26:09,819 --> 04:26:42,420
Nintendo has access to so many characters and so many things that are cool. Play 100 geths.

1167
04:26:46,870 --> 04:27:09,079
Get off of that one. We did that already. The best part of this song is that

1168
04:27:09,079 --> 04:28:13,559
it's not clean. This might be like the four hour version of the song. Good. Keep it on. Oh,

1169
04:28:13,559 --> 04:28:32,120
come on. Why is this not clean? It looks perfect. There we go. Finally. All right. Looks good. Oh,

1170
04:28:32,120 --> 04:28:41,079
it's the 30 minute version. Right. I want to hear the angel. The angel island zone from Brawl.

1171
04:28:42,680 --> 04:29:11,420
That one was also really good. I don't even like these games. Get it up. Get it up. Get it up. Get

1172
04:29:11,420 --> 04:29:25,510
it up. These corners here. You can really tell the part where the drummer really picks up right

1173
04:29:25,510 --> 04:29:30,739
here. He starts like fucking screaming right there. In the audience, you just see the drummer just

1174
04:29:30,739 --> 04:29:36,940
going nuts right there. He's owning his mouth and closing it like opening him out, closing it.

1175
04:29:36,940 --> 04:30:14,659
This is dirty. Look at how sparkly it is over there. I love it. Play it again. Brawl had the

1176
04:30:14,659 --> 04:30:24,329
best soundtrack. It really did. You know, they got real comfy. They got real comfortable after Brawl.

1177
04:30:24,329 --> 04:30:31,079
Remember how big of a deal this was? They have all these songs from other franchises, some of

1178
04:30:31,079 --> 04:30:42,469
them which are not even Nintendo. It was a huge fucking deal. And I think after the Brawl

1179
04:30:42,469 --> 04:30:46,440
soundtrack, it was kind of just like, yeah, we're just going to put music in.

1180
04:30:47,159 --> 04:31:08,950
They made a really big deal about this. Why is this park covered in shit? Ultimate has a massive

1181
04:31:08,950 --> 04:31:17,719
OST. Yeah, but I'll be honest, I only played Ultimate for a week because I got discouraged

1182
04:31:17,719 --> 04:31:21,399
because of how badly I got shit on and online that I was like, I'm never playing this game ever again.

1183
04:31:37,209 --> 04:31:44,200
Online sucks. And it's too bad because Smash Brothers is one of the only fighting games that

1184
04:31:44,200 --> 04:31:58,120
I actually understand. All right, now let's do, um, you know, it's true. He's told that story more

1185
04:31:58,120 --> 04:32:09,639
than a few times. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. Fighting game. I have to put a quotes or an

1186
04:32:09,639 --> 04:32:15,659
asterisk nest to it. It's not a fighting game. It's a party game. The game where you fight

1187
04:32:15,659 --> 04:32:25,579
each other with essentially health bars. It's a fighting game. Mario versus Luigi. They beat the

1188
04:32:25,579 --> 04:32:32,870
shit out of each other and one of them loses the fight. That's a fighting game. Now, it might not

1189
04:32:32,870 --> 04:32:38,149
be a very in-depth fighting game if you really want to call it that. It's not a fighting game.

1190
04:32:38,149 --> 04:32:43,850
It is. They're fighting each other. The characters are fighting on screen. It's a, you could call it

1191
04:32:43,850 --> 04:32:49,639
a party game too, but it's also a fighting game. You pick a character and one of us wins and one

1192
04:32:49,639 --> 04:33:03,879
of us loses. Cod is a fighting game. Dynasty Warriors is a fighting game. It's not a fighting

1193
04:33:03,879 --> 04:33:19,029
game. Well, what makes a fighting game a fighting game then? What makes a fighting game? No, it's

1194
04:33:19,029 --> 04:33:33,020
not. You could say Madden is a fighting game, couldn't you? 2D melee combat. Well, the Hadouken

1195
04:33:33,020 --> 04:33:50,840
is not melee. It has to have frame data and special moves. Chips are dinner. What are you talking

1196
04:33:50,840 --> 04:33:58,200
about? Why'd you say that? Chips are dinner? They could be. They can be if you eat chips for dinner.

1197
04:33:58,200 --> 04:34:06,630
Who said that? That's funny. Is that Joel? Ah, it's fucking, what a hilarious joke.

1198
04:34:08,520 --> 04:34:13,959
You can eat chips for dinner. It sucks. It's bad for you. You can also, you could eat hamburger

1199
04:34:13,959 --> 04:34:31,299
meat for dinner. Literally Smash is a fighting game. What am I gonna put on for music? Smash is

1200
04:34:31,299 --> 04:34:46,099
a kid's game. Okay, is it a kid's fighting game? A party game to me is like, oh, let's put on,

1201
04:34:46,099 --> 04:34:52,659
let's put on, let's put the Tekken soundtrack on. I don't know. You call it whatever you want,

1202
04:34:52,659 --> 04:34:58,549
but I remember playing like Tekken and playing like Virtua Fighter and shit. And those games,

1203
04:34:58,630 --> 04:35:03,029
I remember just playing it with friends and you'd get punched like three times and you'd go,

1204
04:35:03,990 --> 04:35:07,750
KO knockout. You just like fell off the fucking level. It was, it wasn't fun.

1205
04:35:07,750 --> 04:35:14,220
I remember getting caught in like a Tekken combo and I just didn't even get to play the game.

1206
04:35:14,220 --> 04:35:23,990
Like I felt like it wasn't pressing the buttons hard enough in some of those games.

1207
04:35:28,250 --> 04:35:41,340
Tekken also isn't 2D. That's right. Let's play, let's put on Tekken OST. I remember just getting,

1208
04:35:41,340 --> 04:35:45,740
walking outside of bounds accidentally in Virtua Fighter and never playing it again.

1209
04:35:46,380 --> 04:36:01,740
Just smash like a competitive fighting game. I mean, a lot of people would tell you that,

1210
04:36:01,740 --> 04:36:08,169
that Melee is. What separates Melee from any other fighting game? If you, okay, if you do

1211
04:36:08,169 --> 04:36:27,349
no items, no bullshit, just fighting each other, how is it different? Not this debate. Okay. Like

1212
04:36:27,349 --> 04:36:31,509
Brawl would, I would classify maybe not as a fighting game because you can just trip for no

1213
04:36:31,509 --> 04:36:43,540
reason. It's just, and that's, maybe that's not a fighting game. I don't know. Like imagine if

1214
04:36:43,540 --> 04:36:47,299
Street Fighter, if all of a sudden your character fell down like 1% of the time,

1215
04:36:48,099 --> 04:36:53,319
it would suck for a lot of these competitive players.

1216
04:36:54,200 --> 04:37:04,099
Sakurai himself said there's not, Smash is not a fighting game. So there's no debate.

1217
04:37:04,819 --> 04:37:39,450
I mean, but it's, it's not, but we're just playing semantics though. Oh, look at how dirty this

1218
04:37:39,450 --> 04:37:48,569
edge is. It's an action game. It's an action party game that includes fighting people on a stage to

1219
04:37:48,569 --> 04:38:11,909
reduce their health to zero and reduce their lives to zero. All right. Reduce 100%.

1220
04:38:12,790 --> 04:38:18,599
That's a fighting game. Yeah. I mean, I would say that's a fighting game,

1221
04:38:18,599 --> 04:38:24,020
but then like somebody said, what is, is CoD a fighting game? It's you and me versus each other

1222
04:38:24,020 --> 04:38:28,099
on like a battlefield. And I'm trying to reduce your health to zero while we fight each other

1223
04:38:28,099 --> 04:38:35,220
and shoot each other. Why do we have to have all these rules? Why can't we just whatever?

1224
04:38:45,529 --> 04:39:07,220
Guns make it a shooter. Well, striker is in mortal combat. He has a gun. Joker has a gun.

1225
04:39:13,860 --> 04:39:19,779
Isn't there a character in Tekken that's literally, it's like a kangaroo with boxing gloves on.

1226
04:39:21,909 --> 04:39:29,500
That's pretty much a Smash character. I don't think it matters what the weapon you're using

1227
04:39:29,500 --> 04:39:36,520
is. I really don't think so. It's a bear. Who's the kangaroo? Roger. Yeah. It is a raptor as well.

1228
04:39:36,520 --> 04:40:14,419
What game is that? Tekken 3 is a kangaroo and two bears. There's no role playing in most RPGs.

1229
04:40:15,139 --> 04:40:36,709
That's right. Yeah. So who cares? Like, what does it matter? Smash character is an anime

1230
04:40:36,709 --> 04:40:53,659
protagonist with a sword. Well, I mean, I will say that makes up a lot of them. Makes up a lot

1231
04:40:53,659 --> 04:41:09,720
of the characters, but here's the, here's the one thing I will say about Smash to kind of rebut.

1232
04:41:09,720 --> 04:41:15,540
Look, I don't like that there's anime character with sword for 10 characters either. Here's where

1233
04:41:15,540 --> 04:41:18,979
I rebuttal that. It's the only way I can rebuttal this. It's the only way that makes sense to me.

1234
04:41:19,779 --> 04:41:26,919
There's like 85 Smash characters. Isn't there like a hundred playable characters in the Switch one?

1235
04:41:28,169 --> 04:41:39,159
That's so many characters. I guess at some point you're going to make a few more protagonists with

1236
04:41:39,159 --> 04:41:49,029
sword. There's 80 in the Switch one. That's so many. How many characters are in Tekken? 12? 15?

1237
04:41:59,689 --> 04:42:15,319
50? What? There are not 50 characters in Tekken. No way. How many characters are in Tekken 4?

1238
04:42:16,979 --> 04:42:25,720
23 characters in Tekken 4. All right. Tekken 5. 32 in Tekken 5. Tekken 6. 39 in Tekken 6. Tekken 7.

1239
04:42:27,180 --> 04:42:39,220
36 in Tekken 7. Tekken 8. 51 characters. Wait, this is not out yet. Okay. So Tekken 8 is not

1240
04:42:39,220 --> 04:42:50,490
out yet. But even still, in the Tekken that's not out yet, 51 characters are planned for Tekken 8.

1241
04:42:50,490 --> 04:42:56,630
There are 80 in Smash Brothers. So how many characters are there in Street Fighter? Street

1242
04:42:56,630 --> 04:43:02,389
Fighter... I don't even know anything about Street Fighter. They release the same Street Fighter like

1243
04:43:02,389 --> 04:43:07,509
Skyrim style five times every year or two. Street Fighter 5 has come out like four times. How many

1244
04:43:07,509 --> 04:43:12,659
Street Fighters have there been? Street Fighter 6? How many characters are Street Fighter 6?

1245
04:43:13,299 --> 04:43:24,659
Eight? There are only eight characters in Street Fighter 6? How many characters in Street Fighter

1246
04:43:24,659 --> 04:43:40,099
5? 16. It's not out yet. Oh. We gotta stop numbering shit. I'm serious. Stop numbering

1247
04:43:40,099 --> 04:43:47,880
video games. Especially ones that are in a series like this. Like we're gonna get to eventually like

1248
04:43:47,880 --> 04:43:56,380
Tekken 17? Why? Call it like Tekken? The Battle for Azeroth or whatever the hell you want to call it.

1249
04:43:56,380 --> 04:44:01,419
After five, it's like all right. Do we really need to... How many are you gonna number? Like 10,

1250
04:44:01,419 --> 04:44:11,060
12, 15, 20? I made this joke on Twitter and I'm gonna make it on here now too because it's been

1251
04:44:11,060 --> 04:44:18,299
like six and a half years. When you get to the point where your numbered franchise has as many

1252
04:44:18,299 --> 04:44:37,849
numbers as the Jason movies, it's time to figure out another title. Think about this. In 20 more

1253
04:44:37,849 --> 04:44:47,029
years, trying to remember when Street Fighter 7 or 8 came out is gonna be like impossible.

1254
04:44:48,020 --> 04:44:54,979
Street Fighter 4 was... Wait. When the fuck was that? Street Fighter 2? Street Fighter 16? I don't

1255
04:44:54,979 --> 04:45:07,540
remember. When did that character come out? Street Fighter 70? I don't know. Or if you want to number

1256
04:45:07,540 --> 04:45:15,290
them, just do it like they... Yeah. Give it the year. Like Street Fighter 95. Street Fighter 2006.

1257
04:45:15,290 --> 04:45:21,580
So then I can at least know when the hell it was. Street Fighter 2020. Like I have... I know

1258
04:45:21,580 --> 04:45:34,060
when that was. Sonic 06. Yeah. I know exactly when that came out. In the barrage of Sonic the Hedgehog

1259
04:45:34,060 --> 04:45:40,860
video games, I know exactly what that game was. I know the precise opening cutscene. I know all the

1260
04:45:40,860 --> 04:46:06,060
characters in it. I know the exact game. Sonic 06 came out in 2005. Whatever. It's still that same

1261
04:46:06,060 --> 04:46:15,349
period. It's fine. What's the name of the princess in Sonic 06? Oh! I don't know anything! Eliza!

1262
04:46:16,150 --> 04:46:25,000
Ely... Elisa! One of those. I know it's one. It's close. Elise. Oh! Oh! What? I don't know?

1263
04:46:25,000 --> 04:46:41,619
I was very close. Eliza. I don't know. It was one of that. Why did I know that? Because Sonic 06,

1264
04:46:41,619 --> 04:46:45,540
I remember the whole game because it was 06 and I know the exact year. I know the exact place I

1265
04:46:45,540 --> 04:47:04,520
was sitting. Calm down. I'm calm! I remember... I have a very, very distinct memory of Sonic 06.

1266
04:47:04,520 --> 04:47:10,419
You know why? Because I thought that game was weird as shit. Isn't that the game where there's

1267
04:47:10,419 --> 04:47:16,650
like real people and you're in like a real like human city and shit and there's like real people?

1268
04:47:17,450 --> 04:47:32,569
It was really weird to me. It wasn't the typical, oh, you got the cat. You've got

1269
04:47:33,770 --> 04:47:41,740
you got the slug guy. You've got the bat person. You've got the Amy, right? It was... They were

1270
04:47:41,740 --> 04:48:01,369
humans in cutscenes interacting with Sonic. It was kind of strange. Mario Odyssey did that.

1271
04:48:05,450 --> 04:48:11,369
In Sonic 06, the characters were very like life-like human characters. Like CG human

1272
04:48:11,369 --> 04:48:24,229
characters. Very high detailed humans. They were not in Odyssey. They were like very high detailed

1273
04:48:24,229 --> 04:48:34,419
human characters in Odyssey. They were human characters in Odyssey, but they weren't like

1274
04:48:34,419 --> 04:48:40,659
super high quality, high detailed facial structures and stuff, were they? I don't remember that.

1275
04:48:40,659 --> 04:48:59,180
They were like cartoon, right? Sonic 06 had cartoon style of Sonic and then these highly

1276
04:48:59,180 --> 04:49:27,139
detailed human real people. This is almost done. Sonic 06 was not originally a Sonic game. Is that

1277
04:49:27,139 --> 04:49:45,099
why? What was it supposed to be? Who said that? Somebody did. It was supposed to be a Final Fantasy

1278
04:49:45,099 --> 04:49:57,299
game, was it? It was called Humans 06. Oh, that's great. Give that person a badge or something.

1279
04:49:57,299 --> 04:50:18,200
I need music. How about... How about... Cupcakes! How about... Cupcakes! Um, how about...

1280
04:50:26,009 --> 04:50:33,990
Mega Man? That sounds good. Mega Man... See, this is another problem. I know there's a few songs in

1281
04:50:33,990 --> 04:50:40,790
Mega Man that I would like. I don't know if it's Mega Man 3 or Mega Man 10. I'm gonna go with Mega

1282
04:50:40,790 --> 04:51:17,450
Man 3. Mega Man 06. This thing is dirty. Oh, it's definitely Mega Man 3. Let's pick the right one.

1283
04:51:36,250 --> 04:51:53,849
Under the chin. Stuck in here. I want to throw like a water grenade right here. What do you mean?

1284
04:51:54,490 --> 04:52:13,830
Like a clean grenade. It looks pretty good. Water balloon. Yeah, but a big one. Water bazooka? Yep.

1285
04:52:14,389 --> 04:52:24,569
I just said that to you like I was being asked by my mother if I was ready for school

1286
04:52:24,569 --> 04:52:39,979
when I was still sleeping. Yep. Honey, are you already ready? Yep. Yep. That was my favorite

1287
04:52:39,979 --> 04:52:48,439
thing. I always said, I'm just putting my socks on. That was the way to get away from it. Yeah,

1288
04:52:48,439 --> 04:52:54,180
I'm just putting my socks on with my eyes closed. I'm still in bed. I don't know why that worked.

1289
04:52:54,740 --> 04:53:06,009
I guess because putting socks on kind of is a pain in the ass sometimes maybe.

1290
04:53:06,810 --> 04:53:14,169
Like that takes a while for some reason in my child brain. And then if you hear your mother

1291
04:53:14,169 --> 04:53:18,650
start to come towards the room. You hear like the here comes mom. She's walking towards the door.

1292
04:53:19,369 --> 04:53:25,130
You rip out of the bed as fast as you fucking can. You feel horrible. You feel like shit.

1293
04:53:25,130 --> 04:53:28,569
But you immediately grab the fucking pair of socks and like you're struggling to put it on

1294
04:53:28,569 --> 04:53:34,709
your foot. And she comes in. Are you ready? Yeah, I'm just, I'm just socks on. Like you're

1295
04:53:34,709 --> 04:53:41,689
just so fucked up. And then you hear the door close. You look over and you just lie right back

1296
04:53:41,689 --> 04:53:47,380
down. And then you do it all over again. And then your mother thinks that there's like something

1297
04:53:47,380 --> 04:53:54,200
wrong with you because I was just in here 10 minutes ago and you're still having trouble

1298
04:53:54,200 --> 04:54:03,930
putting your socks on. What are you doing? Are you all right? You're putting the sock on the same

1299
04:54:03,930 --> 04:54:24,200
foot when I came in here 10 minutes ago. There was one time when I didn't want to go to school.

1300
04:54:24,200 --> 04:54:29,180
I was like, I don't want to go to school today. Fuck that. I'm staying home. Like, oh, I don't

1301
04:54:29,180 --> 04:54:37,930
feel good. Oh, my stomach hurts. Oh, okay. Yeah. Take your temperature. And I took the thermometer

1302
04:54:37,930 --> 04:54:44,090
and I held it up. I held it up to a light bulb when she left the room. Like a hot light bulb.

1303
04:54:44,090 --> 04:54:47,529
I held it up right to the light bulb. And then I, when I heard her coming back in,

1304
04:54:47,529 --> 04:54:50,970
she was coming back in the room and I put it under my tongue. I put it like in my mouth.

1305
04:54:51,849 --> 04:55:00,299
And she grabbed it. And it was like 110. Something fucking crazy. And she's like,

1306
04:55:00,299 --> 04:55:15,130
uh, what is going on? I don't feel good. And it was just like, go to school. Get up. No,

1307
04:55:15,130 --> 04:55:18,889
but I don't feel good. I think I have a temperature. Okay, because if you had 108

1308
04:55:18,889 --> 04:55:22,729
temperatures, you'd be dead. Um, you're still alive. So I don't know what you did here,

1309
04:55:22,729 --> 04:55:30,119
but get up and go to fucking school. I'd be like, oh, whatever. I would just get up and get ready.

1310
04:55:31,860 --> 04:55:39,299
Stole that from ET. I probably did. Probably watched it and thought it would work.

1311
04:55:40,650 --> 04:55:44,970
I used to do that shit. I put orange juice in my, I'm not, I'm not making this up. This is a

1312
04:55:44,970 --> 04:55:53,209
fucking real story. I put orange juice in my mouth one time and went to, so my grandmother was around.

1313
04:55:53,209 --> 04:55:58,939
My grandmother was watching us at the time. And I put orange juice in my mouth and like went on the

1314
04:55:58,939 --> 04:56:08,279
ground going like, Oh no, like I'm going to puke. And I went like, and I spit like three tablespoons

1315
04:56:08,279 --> 04:56:21,610
of orange juice onto the ground. It was like, what are you doing? I was like, I'm sexy. You were a

1316
04:56:21,610 --> 04:56:31,580
little shit. No, I just, no, I wasn't. It was a tile floor. So it was easy to clean. I was like 10

1317
04:56:32,380 --> 04:56:44,419
and it was, it was very clearly. I put orange juice in my mouth and I was like, I'm, look at me.

1318
04:56:44,419 --> 04:56:51,700
I'm sick. I'm puking on the ground and it never worked. I always thought somehow it was going to

1319
04:56:51,700 --> 04:56:57,529
work one day and it never did. It's really funny because if I, if I had just, and I used to do this

1320
04:56:57,529 --> 04:57:02,729
sometimes, if I was like, like, nah, I'm not really feeling that great. I'm really kind of,

1321
04:57:02,729 --> 04:57:07,529
I think I need to take like a day. I'm like, I don't feel great. It was like, okay, yeah, sure.

1322
04:57:08,409 --> 04:57:10,409
But it was the times that I was like, oh, I'm sick.

1323
04:57:13,049 --> 04:57:17,770
And I would always put on a voice. You guys ever do that? You ever put on the, I'm sick voice?

1324
04:57:17,770 --> 04:57:24,659
Here's the, I'm sick voice. Mom, I don't feel good. Yeah. I don't know if something's wrong.

1325
04:57:24,659 --> 04:57:29,299
I think I like, I have a headache and everything. What, what does that, what does that mean?

1326
04:57:29,299 --> 04:57:40,299
Doesn't mean anything. Oh, I feel good because my head is hurting. Nobody talks like that. Even

1327
04:57:40,299 --> 04:57:47,860
when you're sick, what are you doing? If, if I had just been honest with my mother, it wouldn't be

1328
04:57:47,860 --> 04:57:51,540
like, all right, go to school. It'd be like, oh, all right. You don't, that's fine. Yeah. Take a day.

1329
04:58:04,340 --> 04:58:08,740
It was not hard. It would just be like, I don't really feel like going to school today. I like,

1330
04:58:08,740 --> 04:58:13,450
don't feel like it. It's like, all right. Is everything all right? Like, yeah, I just,

1331
04:58:13,450 --> 04:58:21,180
I don't know. I just don't want to. I'm telling you right now, it was a fucking miracle that I

1332
04:58:21,180 --> 04:58:28,220
like passed any school besides college. I actually, I tried. I really did try in college. I did.

1333
04:58:28,860 --> 04:58:34,599
I want, I wanted to like do well and I want to do like college stuff. And I, I really did try.

1334
04:58:35,400 --> 04:58:42,200
But man, in high school and in middle school, I think, I honestly think I did one homework

1335
04:58:42,200 --> 04:58:49,060
worksheet in four years. I seriously think that I truly believe that. And I would just do well on

1336
04:58:49,060 --> 04:58:56,229
the tests. Like I would just get like an 80 or 85 on the tests. I just wouldn't ever do homework,

1337
04:58:56,229 --> 04:59:18,500
ever. 2.6 Andy. 2.8, 2.6. Same. I hated homework. Homework is such a scam. It really is.

1338
04:59:19,220 --> 04:59:28,150
Nobody wants to do that shit at their house. I don't think it does anything for kids. I really

1339
04:59:28,150 --> 04:59:31,830
don't think it helps retain information. I really don't think so. I actually don't believe that.

1340
04:59:34,099 --> 04:59:39,700
I think homework makes a little bit of sense. It's almost like the teachers are trying just to get

1341
04:59:39,700 --> 04:59:45,369
you to continue to pay attention or something. But it's like, like, no, no, no, you have to go

1342
04:59:45,369 --> 04:59:49,450
back into your house and do this too. Cause I want to make sure you fucking paid attention today.

1343
04:59:49,450 --> 04:59:57,209
Well, make your class not suck. How does that sound? And then you have the other problem is

1344
04:59:57,209 --> 05:00:03,189
teachers are so underpaid, at least in America, we should be, we should be paying teachers a shit

1345
05:00:03,189 --> 05:00:15,939
load of money. And I mean it in an absolute metric fuck ton of money. Schools should only be four

1346
05:00:15,939 --> 05:00:21,560
days a week and it shouldn't be six hours. It should be like fucking four. Pay teachers a shit

1347
05:00:21,560 --> 05:00:27,270
load of money and it'll be like classes will be better. They'll be more interesting, have interesting

1348
05:00:27,270 --> 05:00:34,919
classes. You know what I mean? Why is it so hard to figure out? This actually is not even that hard

1349
05:00:34,919 --> 05:00:43,740
of a thing to figure out. This is not even difficult. This is like common sense. I was so

1350
05:00:43,740 --> 05:00:49,430
unproductive when I was a kid because I waking up at six o'clock in the morning and going to school

1351
05:00:49,430 --> 05:00:56,250
for six hours, I just, it sucked. I just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. Now imagine

1352
05:00:56,330 --> 05:01:02,009
if school didn't start till fucking 10 or 9 and the classes were interesting, the teachers really

1353
05:01:02,009 --> 05:01:05,049
gave a shit, really, really did. And there are teachers that do give a shit. They do, a lot of

1354
05:01:05,049 --> 05:01:12,139
them. Pay the teachers more money. I would get the 30 fucking thousand dollars a year for a teacher,

1355
05:01:12,139 --> 05:01:18,889
40,000. Double that overnight, immediately. Holy shit, we're talking about our kids' brains for

1356
05:01:18,889 --> 05:01:42,180
God's sake. So much more productivity comes in place when people like want to do it and they're

1357
05:01:42,180 --> 05:01:45,939
prepared to do it and it's not, they're not being forced to do it. I think that's the biggest problem.

1358
05:01:45,939 --> 05:01:54,740
I really do. When I was in school, I felt like I was forced to do it. And there were some classes,

1359
05:01:54,740 --> 05:01:57,380
there were some times where I felt like, oh, actually, you know what, like doing this math

1360
05:01:57,380 --> 05:02:03,159
problem, I actually kind of liked this. It wasn't every day at all. Because maybe like a few times,

1361
05:02:03,159 --> 05:02:06,360
maybe like a few times a week was I really like in the head space of like, you know what, I guess

1362
05:02:06,360 --> 05:02:18,500
I can do like a bunch of long division or something. Fine. You can jump in the game. Yeah, take a look.

1363
05:02:33,849 --> 05:02:38,009
And it's like, even for the kids that really excel, I'm sure some of you, I'm sure probably

1364
05:02:38,009 --> 05:02:44,259
really excel in school. I'm sure you do. But how much more, how much better would you be doing

1365
05:02:45,240 --> 05:02:52,709
if you had the more tools to do better? If the classes were even more interesting, right? If

1366
05:02:52,709 --> 05:02:59,270
like your teachers didn't have to fucking fight the budget board to like get pens and shit and

1367
05:02:59,270 --> 05:03:02,869
like pencils, you know what I mean? Like there's so much things that teachers would like to do.

1368
05:03:05,099 --> 05:03:20,299
We're having a money. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. I would probably still hate

1369
05:03:20,299 --> 05:03:25,430
school. Look, school is school, right? You got, you do it. You got to learn stuff. And there's

1370
05:03:25,430 --> 05:03:30,229
another thing. What in the name of God, and I'm going to go off on this, right? This is time to

1371
05:03:30,229 --> 05:03:36,659
do it during the Mega Man song, right? I don't care. I'm just going off. I'm doing it. Why do

1372
05:03:36,659 --> 05:03:44,599
we not teach everybody, put a huge emphasis on like finances and, and how to like file a

1373
05:03:44,599 --> 05:03:50,759
fucking tax return and stuff. We spend like an hour on that shit. Sometimes like maybe one week

1374
05:03:51,400 --> 05:03:58,650
of like your, your home ec class is about some of this stuff. Teach kids what like a credit

1375
05:03:58,650 --> 05:04:04,630
score is, what like a credit card does. Financial like literacy, like we need to teach this shit to

1376
05:04:04,630 --> 05:04:11,000
people. Like we don't even, it's just, oh, well maybe one day they'll figure it out. What the

1377
05:04:11,000 --> 05:04:17,500
hell is school for? If not to prepare everybody for adulthood, right? It's to prepare us for the

1378
05:04:17,500 --> 05:04:28,040
fucking world. I'll be honest. I don't really care about like doing math problems or what

1379
05:04:28,919 --> 05:04:35,639
like Genghis Khan did. We have Netflix documentaries that can cover that shit in an hour.

1380
05:04:36,279 --> 05:04:49,319
And I'm not saying that stuff's not important. It is. It is. We need to obviously learn about

1381
05:04:49,319 --> 05:04:52,919
who we are and where, what people are, where they're from, what people have done,

1382
05:04:54,040 --> 05:04:57,799
what the world was like, what are the things that happened, major important, of course.

1383
05:04:58,759 --> 05:05:03,580
But to replace, to replace like actual life skills and teaching people things that they're

1384
05:05:03,580 --> 05:05:10,040
going to need. I think the focus is on preparing people for adulthood because when you're not

1385
05:05:10,040 --> 05:05:26,939
prepared for adulthood, then you get stuck. Are you running for office? Yes. No, I'm not.

1386
05:05:28,330 --> 05:05:34,099
This is not even some like, oh wow, he was so brave. No, I don't think that. I just,

1387
05:05:34,099 --> 05:05:39,860
I honestly just think. You guys know how much, you want to get like angry for a second?

1388
05:05:40,500 --> 05:05:46,740
Look at, at least in the United States, go look at the breakdown of where our federal tax dollars

1389
05:05:46,740 --> 05:05:51,860
go. Just go do it. It takes two seconds. Go look at where education is, how much we spend federally

1390
05:05:51,860 --> 05:06:10,810
on education. Huh? What? They need to increase that by a huge amount. This is not, it's not

1391
05:06:10,810 --> 05:06:16,090
political. This is not political. This is just like, well, well, well, well, it is political,

1392
05:06:16,090 --> 05:06:21,610
whatever. I'm breaking my own rules. I know. No, it's not political. It's not political.

1393
05:06:22,330 --> 05:06:27,049
I'm just telling you to go look. We don't spend very much on education at all.

1394
05:06:27,049 --> 05:06:40,810
And it's incredibly important. It's not politics. It's just, this is just whatever. It's not a lot.

1395
05:06:40,810 --> 05:06:51,430
And like, why is it not a lot? We don't, we, education is so important. Science, medicine,

1396
05:06:51,430 --> 05:06:57,740
technology, right? Like these are things we need to do. Just go look at the budget one day. Just go

1397
05:06:57,740 --> 05:07:02,060
look at it and be like, Oh, I wonder where our money goes. And just look at it. Just stare at it

1398
05:07:02,060 --> 05:07:28,139
for a half a minute. This is based. No, it's not. It's not. It really isn't. This is very based. I

1399
05:07:28,139 --> 05:07:34,409
mean, I just think it's, I think a lot of issues could be solved in our country, in our world,

1400
05:07:34,409 --> 05:07:48,779
in our country. Let me, let me put like fake fucking crowd music. I think that a lot of issues

1401
05:07:48,779 --> 05:07:58,490
in our country can be completely solved by having a much better education system, teaching kids

1402
05:07:58,490 --> 05:08:02,970
what they need to learn to be an adult. Fine. I'm talking about financial literacy. I'm talking about

1403
05:08:04,810 --> 05:08:09,770
skills that they'll need to learn to be a functioning adult. I'm talking about being

1404
05:08:09,770 --> 05:08:14,650
able to teach kids, not just about like history and science and social studies. I'm talking

1405
05:08:14,650 --> 05:08:21,049
about life skills, things you need. It shouldn't be 2% of the budget. It should be probably 10.

1406
05:08:26,779 --> 05:08:31,099
If that's political, I'm sorry, then this is a political stream at the moment or this moment.

1407
05:08:31,099 --> 05:08:37,430
I don't think it is. More money to teachers, more money to programs. Like you take a look at,

1408
05:08:39,029 --> 05:08:42,310
you take a look at what are like our programs that are suffering right now.

1409
05:08:42,310 --> 05:08:48,549
Extracurricular shit to like, like our arts and the arts programs are all just suffering.

1410
05:08:48,549 --> 05:08:56,360
You know what I mean? Like what the hell's going on? Oh, I'm looking at my phone.

1411
05:09:02,180 --> 05:09:13,639
Hold your applause for a second. I had to look at my phone. He's getting texted. No, but seriously,

1412
05:09:14,810 --> 05:09:21,740
programs like, okay, when we did the archeology thing, like the science center, they do virtual

1413
05:09:21,740 --> 05:09:25,659
field trips and shit. Imagine how awesome that would be if that was just no, like just a part

1414
05:09:25,659 --> 05:09:31,959
of everybody's lives as a kid. More field trips, do more cool shit. I don't want to go to the same

1415
05:09:31,959 --> 05:09:40,150
place for a field trip. I don't want a field trip to just be, we go into a bus and go to Dairy Queen.

1416
05:09:42,099 --> 05:09:53,340
That's not a field trip. You know how many times I've seen the people, the old time people churn

1417
05:09:53,340 --> 05:10:01,000
the butter when I was younger? Oh, this is what it was like back in the old times. I've been to that

1418
05:10:01,000 --> 05:10:35,080
place like 10 times and go Red Sox. Oh, this feels good. I like this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you.

1419
05:10:38,330 --> 05:10:44,840
But seriously, if you go look at where our money goes, I think we could really stand to put a

1420
05:10:44,840 --> 05:10:52,759
little more of our, we could restructure our budget a little bit, have people going to school and

1421
05:10:52,759 --> 05:10:57,240
shit be really important. I guess it is important and not just not shitty school, not dumb school,

1422
05:10:57,240 --> 05:11:05,459
not school that everybody hates going to. I don't want to dump a shitload more money into

1423
05:11:06,020 --> 05:11:09,939
a boring shitty education system. I'm talking about, let's redo the whole goddamn thing.

1424
05:11:10,659 --> 05:11:14,360
Make it good. Make it fun. Make it interesting. Make it engaging. You know what I mean? Then you'd

1425
05:11:14,360 --> 05:11:30,599
want to do it. You'd want to go and fuck Capcom by the way. Yeah. You say that at like the political,

1426
05:11:31,240 --> 05:11:40,439
at like the big speech and like my campaign rally and fuck Capcom. What's with the FOV?

1427
05:11:40,439 --> 05:11:48,889
They need to change that. And honestly, I don't think it even matters like where you even stand

1428
05:11:48,889 --> 05:11:54,790
politically. I think that everybody could probably agree that we got to, we got to make our shit a

1429
05:11:54,790 --> 05:11:57,830
little better. You know what I mean? We've got to like put another, a higher standard here. We've

1430
05:11:57,830 --> 05:12:04,439
got to make a little bit more. I don't think that's like a necessarily biased statement to

1431
05:12:04,439 --> 05:12:30,979
any political leaning. I really don't think it is. No, you don't know what I am. You don't

1432
05:12:30,979 --> 05:12:34,979
know how I lean politically. I've never talked about it. You have no idea. You have absolutely

1433
05:12:34,979 --> 05:12:43,419
no idea. You guess. I'm going to keep you guessing. But that's not what this stream is for. And we

1434
05:12:43,419 --> 05:12:49,099
talked about that before as well. But sometimes, you know, you got to talk about some things.

1435
05:12:49,099 --> 05:12:53,340
I had to. I had to. I've got something on my mind recently. It has. You literally told us. No,

1436
05:12:53,340 --> 05:12:58,619
I didn't. I thought you were centrist. No, when did I say that? I said that? When did I say that?

1437
05:12:59,180 --> 05:13:11,990
When did I say that? Did I get shitfaced one day and say that? Was I like drunk on wine and I was

1438
05:13:11,990 --> 05:13:24,180
like, I'm a centrist. When did that happen? I don't think that happened. That didn't happen.

1439
05:13:24,180 --> 05:13:29,540
You didn't have to say that. What are you talking about? I've never, it's a fucking secret

1440
05:13:30,259 --> 05:13:37,099
of what, how, what I believe. All right. And no, don't let anybody ever tell you differently.

1441
05:13:37,099 --> 05:13:56,090
It's obvious. What's obvious? What do you mean it's obvious? Why are you panicking? I'm not

1442
05:13:56,090 --> 05:14:18,009
panicking. Whatever. It's in your rant section on YouTube, is it? You support Verbin Supreme.

1443
05:14:19,900 --> 05:14:37,270
I mean, that guy's fucking hilarious, but I don't know what his policies are. I'm already at 60%

1444
05:14:37,270 --> 05:15:00,060
here. Just admit it. You watched Bionicle with Biden. It's obvious. We know. You don't know

1445
05:15:00,060 --> 05:15:11,900
anything. Nobody knows anything. Let me just pretend that people don't know. An anarchist?

1446
05:15:11,900 --> 05:15:35,720
I'm not an anarchist. What are you talking about? You're a Minecraft anarchist. I don't even know

1447
05:15:35,720 --> 05:15:59,540
what that is. I have no idea what I just said. The ultimate secret of German 985s political leanings.

1448
05:15:59,540 --> 05:16:22,279
All right. This is good. I want more soap. Soap is pretty good here. Soap is actually good here.

1449
05:16:22,279 --> 05:16:36,259
I gotta get in there. How do I get up there? Do I have to go across the bars? He's a biblio

1450
05:16:36,900 --> 05:16:59,369
gugu gaga ding dongist. What is that? Sure, I guess. Stop playing this? I'm having fun. I like this.

1451
05:17:09,450 --> 05:17:37,849
There we go. Get in there. That's my dirt KD. Pretty high. Show us what you look like without

1452
05:17:37,849 --> 05:17:42,759
your dentures in. Why would I do that? I don't like the way I look without my dentures in. Why

1453
05:17:42,759 --> 05:18:31,909
would I do that? Stop hot boxing the playground. This is open air in here. Geriatric Andy. I'm not

1454
05:18:31,909 --> 05:18:43,500
geriatric. I am getting older though. You do have that right. It's okay to get older. I don't feel a

1455
05:18:43,500 --> 05:18:50,709
day over 30. I definitely feel 30 though. In fact, probably a little bit older. I don't feel a day

1456
05:18:50,709 --> 05:19:18,549
over 32. You know what I mean? I missed it. You said something but I missed it. 62%. Let's go.

1457
05:19:19,189 --> 05:19:38,069
How is it like living past 30? I like it. I like it. I like being 30 plus. Slow down a little bit.

1458
05:19:38,709 --> 05:19:52,389
Takes me a little longer. I just like kind of chill. Oh, I know. I get that.

1459
05:19:59,400 --> 05:20:03,080
You get angry when young people are loud. I get angry when anybody gets loud.

1460
05:20:15,369 --> 05:20:30,680
I like that. Trinket. From a chill, you're not 60. Yeah, I can guarantee you that I've lost a

1461
05:20:30,680 --> 05:20:37,130
step or two though. I mean, look, I already have like a medical problem, right? I didn't have that

1462
05:20:37,130 --> 05:20:42,459
in my 20s. That started in my 30s. Already, I can tell you, I've slowed down quite a bit.

1463
05:20:54,169 --> 05:21:13,580
Is there a ladder here? Because this is annoying. All right, this is done. I'm 20 and I have a

1464
05:21:13,580 --> 05:21:24,540
bunch of medical problems. It's really a dice roll. Yeah, I know. That's true. I'm sorry to hear that

1465
05:21:24,540 --> 05:22:35,349
though. Get some music? All right, yeah. Do it. What the fuck? He didn't even do it.

1466
05:22:35,349 --> 05:23:13,099
Do it. Why won't he do it? Why was this file? The person played in the wrong file or something.

1467
05:23:34,659 --> 05:23:58,919
Fucking do it. Thank you. It's not the mandala effect. It's right there. I need an actual

1468
05:23:59,000 --> 05:24:44,810
OST though. How about Donut Country? Oh, this is nice. Sure. I have a homework assignment for you

1469
05:24:44,810 --> 05:24:49,580
guys. I know homework. You don't want to do homework. I know we just talked about it, but that

1470
05:24:52,790 --> 05:24:59,099
it's in something else and I don't know what it's in. It's been bugging me for like 25 fucking years.

1471
05:25:00,650 --> 05:25:09,459
It's in something else. It happens in either another game or a TV show or it's been bugging

1472
05:25:09,459 --> 05:25:28,040
me for like 20 years. When's the homework due? Next week. Oh, this is oh my god. This one's

1473
05:25:28,040 --> 05:25:51,540
horrible. I'm buying the soap. Let's go. It works so much better. I can do the rest of the cleanup

1474
05:25:51,540 --> 05:26:05,369
later with the save for the new gun. Okay, that's good. Now go like this. This nozzle is terrible.

1475
05:26:06,009 --> 05:26:15,479
The only thing that takes any dirt up anymore is the green and the yellow and barely the green.

1476
05:26:16,040 --> 05:26:38,939
I need that new gun right now. Was it 1200? I don't know this song. Just skipping. Like it was a CD.

1477
05:26:39,659 --> 05:27:23,209
Why is it doing that? 1080 nozzle. I got a 3090 now, man. Nice flex. No, see what happened was

1478
05:27:23,209 --> 05:27:31,400
I was forced to buy one because graphics cards didn't exist and me and Community Jake were both

1479
05:27:31,400 --> 05:27:38,439
desperately in all these different places trying to find a graphics card because remember eight

1480
05:27:38,439 --> 05:27:45,529
months ago when I wanted to build a new computer? So I didn't want a 3090, but I got a 3090 because

1481
05:27:45,529 --> 05:28:03,450
that was all that was available and I'll tell you this thing is hot. This thing runs way hotter

1482
05:28:03,450 --> 05:28:14,500
than my 1080. So now I get computer room syndrome which means it just gets so hot in here because I

1483
05:28:14,500 --> 05:28:26,779
have this monster 3090 in here generating furnace level of heat. What's the average temp on it?

1484
05:28:27,799 --> 05:28:34,169
It's really high. I'm gonna have to do something about it. It's way too high. I think it hits like

1485
05:28:34,169 --> 05:28:50,119
90 Celsius 95 92 all the time. I think it peaks at like 100. Underclock it. It's not overclocked.

1486
05:28:50,119 --> 05:28:57,060
It's just regular clock speed. Yeah, these things just run insanely hot. I looked it up.

1487
05:28:57,060 --> 05:29:10,060
I might have to get a cooler for this thing in particular. Underclock it. Why would I want to do

1488
05:29:10,060 --> 05:29:23,639
that? Memory runs warm probably referring to that. Micron posted actual specs recently. Max 105

1489
05:29:23,639 --> 05:29:31,529
Celsius under load. That seems so hot. That seems like it shouldn't be like that. That's more than

1490
05:29:31,529 --> 05:29:54,299
boiling water, isn't it? That's like 200 something degrees. Get a water cooler. Yeah, I'm gonna have

1491
05:29:54,299 --> 05:30:00,119
to do something. I really don't want one of those big elaborate tube systems though. I can just get

1492
05:30:00,119 --> 05:30:17,750
a GPU cooler and replace the stock fans on it, right? That'll probably be fine. Get an AIO. AIO, okay.

1493
05:30:18,470 --> 05:30:50,650
What's an AIO? This whole thing under here. PC will cool it, but your room might be just as hot.

1494
05:30:50,650 --> 05:31:01,509
Yeah, they make it make AC units for the back of a computer. I think they do. They're probably so

1495
05:31:01,509 --> 05:31:23,400
stupid expensive though. All the geek squad. Stick it in the fridge. Just get a mini fridge,

1496
05:31:23,400 --> 05:31:29,450
put the computer in the mini fridge, and have the power cord be coming out of like a hole I drilled.

1497
05:31:31,540 --> 05:31:46,950
Would that work? What would that do? That would work, right? There's a Linus Tech Tips video on

1498
05:31:46,950 --> 05:32:14,360
that. That's funny. I'll have to watch that later. 73%. All right, get in there. Can you power wash

1499
05:32:14,360 --> 05:32:21,159
your balls? Well, if you did that, I don't... I think you'd be at the hospital. That would be a

1500
05:32:21,159 --> 05:32:30,419
bad idea. I think that would be a major, major mistake. I would not ever ever do something like

1501
05:32:30,419 --> 05:33:14,759
that. Sounds very dangerous and very stupid. God. 74. This one should be way more than 400 bucks.

1502
05:33:14,759 --> 05:33:36,459
It should be way more. This is so much more time. This is so much more work. GPU hot tub?

1503
05:33:36,459 --> 05:33:48,180
And if you dropped a GPU into oil or something, right? What are those computers I see sometimes

1504
05:33:49,270 --> 05:33:55,990
where all the parts are just in oil? It's like an oil-cooled PC or something. It's weird. Mineral

1505
05:33:55,990 --> 05:34:14,299
oil. Does that work? Deep fried PC. I saw videos on it before where the entire computer is just

1506
05:34:14,299 --> 05:34:24,020
submerged in mineral oil, right? There's a lot of downsides to it, but it does sort of work, huh?

1507
05:34:30,869 --> 05:34:37,860
Well, I mean, problem number one is I really don't want to fry later sitting in my room just

1508
05:34:38,680 --> 05:34:55,369
ready to tip over. Oh, what do I want to eat? I just thought of like fried chicken. Somebody said

1509
05:34:55,369 --> 05:35:03,270
KFC. It'd be like Taco Bell or something. Re-cheesy godita crunches with the Doritos,

1510
05:35:03,270 --> 05:35:14,229
Locos, Tacos. Yep. I think that sounds like a great idea to me. That's the best thing there.

1511
05:35:22,540 --> 05:35:38,729
Oh, bean burrito? The cheesy godita crunch really might be the single most brilliant fast food

1512
05:35:38,729 --> 05:35:44,569
invention. It really is. I think it is like the best fast food item. Where did I put it on the

1513
05:35:44,569 --> 05:35:59,349
tier list? I put it up real high, didn't I? Where was it? Was it A? Was it S or was it A or B? It

1514
05:35:59,349 --> 05:36:15,139
was somewhere higher. It was A. Where did I put an S tier for fast food stuff? German 985 meal?

1515
05:36:15,139 --> 05:36:19,459
At Taco Bell, it's three cheesy godita crunches with Doritos, Tacos, and that's it. You just get

1516
05:36:19,459 --> 05:36:40,540
a drink. That's it. You don't get anything else. Not even the cinnamon things? No, no, I just want

1517
05:36:41,340 --> 05:36:47,259
I'm trying to really think the last time I ordered something else off the Taco Bell menu

1518
05:36:47,259 --> 05:36:55,369
that was not that. I don't think I ever have. Well, before the cheesy godita crunch came out,

1519
05:36:55,369 --> 05:37:02,490
I ordered tacos, the Mexican pizza they had there, chalupa, whatever. After cheesy godita crunch,

1520
05:37:03,349 --> 05:37:08,470
every single order was cheesy godita crunch. I've never ordered anything else off of that menu

1521
05:37:09,029 --> 05:37:30,060
since 1998, whenever it was. It's so good. It really is. It is so good. Oh, I'm getting it.

1522
05:37:30,060 --> 05:37:38,869
I want it right now. What's your opinion on the Crunch Wrap Supreme? It's not the cheesy

1523
05:37:38,869 --> 05:37:43,349
godita crunch, so I will never order it and I will never eat it. I've never had it and I never

1524
05:37:43,349 --> 05:37:51,349
will. There's no other reason. There's no reason for me to order it. All right, if Taco Bell pulls

1525
05:37:51,909 --> 05:37:58,299
a fast one here and they remove that off the menu, I'm not sure I would ever go there again.

1526
05:37:58,299 --> 05:38:04,069
I really don't think so. There's no reason for me to be there. I go to Taco Bell for the cheesy

1527
05:38:04,069 --> 05:38:21,369
godita crunch. If it's not there, I'm not going. Fuck you, German. The Crunch Wrap is a staple.

1528
05:38:23,209 --> 05:38:27,450
I'm sure it's good. It doesn't matter. I'm never going to order something that's not

1529
05:38:27,450 --> 05:38:31,990
the cheesy godita crunch. It's never going to happen. Because you could say, well, dude,

1530
05:38:31,990 --> 05:38:37,029
you get three cheesy godita crunches. Just order two and get a Crunch Wrap. No, no, no, no, no.

1531
05:38:37,029 --> 05:38:42,259
Excuse me. No, thank you. That's one full cheesy godita crunch I will not be able to enjoy.

1532
05:38:43,639 --> 05:38:51,750
I want the full satisfaction. I will take a bite of the Crunch Wrap Supreme and be sitting there

1533
05:38:51,750 --> 05:39:08,060
going, I wish this was a cheesy godita crunch. Why did I order it? I wish they would make

1534
05:39:08,060 --> 05:39:17,770
more cheesy godita crunch variants. They just have the normal one and then they have the Doritos

1535
05:39:17,770 --> 05:39:32,200
one. Make some different ones. You're a cheesy godita dunce. That was pretty good.

1536
05:39:36,729 --> 05:39:54,090
This place is so, how could dirt be in every single area? What even is 864p? Don't click it,

1537
05:39:54,090 --> 05:40:00,580
man. It was a part of a prank video I'm doing. We just finished the shoot and I don't want

1538
05:40:00,580 --> 05:40:12,700
anyone else to click on it. Just be careful. Don't click it. If you want to know, it's the,

1539
05:40:12,700 --> 05:40:17,819
it's a resolution that's divisible by 8, therefore it is true 16 by 9. If you don't

1540
05:40:17,819 --> 05:40:22,220
have a resolution that's divisible by 8, then the program has to do extra work

1541
05:40:23,020 --> 05:40:53,380
for pixels that don't exist. That's it. See, I'm smart, I know things. I mean, I would,

1542
05:40:53,380 --> 05:41:01,479
I want to up my bitrate, but I don't think I can. I think there's a cap on what you're allowed to

1543
05:41:01,479 --> 05:41:12,650
actually do for a bitrate. It was a huge frog burp and I hope nobody heard it. Yeah, 6k, yeah.

1544
05:41:13,290 --> 05:41:21,939
To have anything over 720 not look like ass at 60 FPS, that's got to be at least 8,000.

1545
05:41:23,779 --> 05:41:33,819
8, 9, 10,000. You can do 1080 30 and it will look probably fine. Either that or you have to have

1546
05:41:33,819 --> 05:41:41,430
such a monster CPU that you can drop the preset down to like slow or slowest and then you don't

1547
05:41:41,430 --> 05:41:53,500
need the bitrate. But I don't have a CPU that can do that. I haven't really tried though.

1548
05:41:53,500 --> 05:42:11,619
What OST is this? This is pretty good. I forgot what it was. What's my CPU? My CPU is, I actually

1549
05:42:11,619 --> 05:42:27,580
forget. It's a new computer. Oh, my CPU is a Ryzen 7 5800X 8 core. So it's a 5800X Ryzen 7

1550
05:42:28,220 --> 05:42:52,700
8 core. It has 30 webcams but not two PCs. Well, the 30 webcam stream, the problem was all the

1551
05:42:52,700 --> 05:42:57,560
the bus lanes. There's only a certain amount of lanes on a motherboard where you can plug in like

1552
05:42:57,560 --> 05:43:05,099
webcam but there's a solution for it. Actually, Community Jake and I have been talking about that

1553
05:43:05,099 --> 05:43:11,979
one and the solution for it is something we can do. Maybe it would be fun to do. I donated all the

1554
05:43:11,979 --> 05:43:21,189
webcams. I had like 30 webcams. Like I had like at least 20, 15. I just donated them. I couldn't

1555
05:43:21,189 --> 05:43:33,770
even use them. I was never gonna be able to use them. Did you sign them? No, why would I sign them?

1556
05:43:33,849 --> 05:44:01,959
30, 20, 15. Yeah, whatever. Buff, puke, whatever. Sidekick, puke. Oh, we have a horrible news.

1557
05:44:01,959 --> 05:44:07,720
Pizza the Hut ate himself in his car. He was locked in his car. What's that from Spaceballs?

1558
05:44:07,720 --> 05:44:26,819
Oh, that's a good movie. Pizza the Hut, he had to eat himself because he locked himself in his car.

1559
05:44:27,459 --> 05:44:47,959
I keep overlooking that from that movie. That guy literally ate himself and died. How do you eat

1560
05:44:47,959 --> 05:44:53,290
yourself? He was a pizza. If you didn't see Spaceballs, Pizza the Hut is a character who

1561
05:44:53,290 --> 05:44:59,669
is just a slice of pizza. He's disgusting. It's gross. There's like cheese falling off of him

1562
05:44:59,669 --> 05:45:17,639
and pepperonis and shit. It's really odd. He's a really fucking crazy character. The king of the

1563
05:45:17,639 --> 05:45:37,639
Schwartz. See you next time for Spaceballs 2. The search for more money. That's classic Mel Brooks,

1564
05:45:37,639 --> 05:45:54,119
man. There's not, I don't think there's very much Mel Brooks did that I didn't like.

1565
05:45:54,919 --> 05:46:22,500
Rick Moranis. He was so good in that movie too. What the hell am I looking at? There's a lot of

1566
05:46:22,500 --> 05:46:29,189
new people here, but that's my favorite gag ever. If you want to know what my all-time favorite

1567
05:46:29,189 --> 05:46:36,580
joke ever and any piece of media ever. Comedy, stand-up, movies, TV shows, video games. It's

1568
05:46:36,580 --> 05:46:41,939
that scene from Spaceballs where they have to put the Spaceballs movie into the fucking video player

1569
05:46:42,740 --> 05:46:49,750
to find out what they have to do next. That's, that is the best joke I've ever seen.

1570
05:46:51,189 --> 05:47:04,069
Nothing even comes close. Not even close. Oh, fast-forward this part. Yeah, I guess it's like

1571
05:47:04,069 --> 05:47:08,869
the embarrassing part where he like falls and like hits his head. He's like fast-forward this part.

1572
05:47:08,869 --> 05:47:14,729
In fact, never play this again. Then they go too far and they get to the point where they're

1573
05:47:14,729 --> 05:47:19,060
actually in the same part of the movie of them standing there looking at the screen.

1574
05:47:19,700 --> 05:47:24,919
It's like, what is this? And he's like, oh, it's now, sir. We're watching now.

1575
05:47:25,479 --> 05:47:33,400
How does this make any sense? This can't be. If you've never seen Spaceballs, that's required

1576
05:47:33,400 --> 05:47:53,060
reading for this stream. What's the syllabus? I could give you guys the syllabus.

1577
05:47:54,419 --> 05:47:59,139
That actually is funny to me. Should I make a syllabus for you guys of things you have to

1578
05:47:59,139 --> 05:48:16,229
watch before watching this stream? I like that. That's actually kind of funny. 85%. All right,

1579
05:48:16,229 --> 05:48:30,939
come on, let's go. The syllabus, by the way, has nothing to do with any of my content.

1580
05:48:33,349 --> 05:48:40,299
You don't have to go watch any of my videos. Just go watch Spaceballs three times. Watch

1581
05:48:40,299 --> 05:48:45,419
Ghostbusters one, Ghostbusters two, Gremlins two. Gremlins one is good, but Gremlins two is

1582
05:48:45,419 --> 05:49:14,549
better. I can make the whole syllabus for you. All the Shpee videos. Don't do that. Gremlins

1583
05:49:14,549 --> 05:49:19,029
two is also one of the most important movies of my entire life. So yeah, I would say that that is

1584
05:49:19,029 --> 05:49:34,259
huge too. Who Framed Roger Rabbit? That's another one that's incredibly important, required reading.

1585
05:49:34,259 --> 05:49:50,759
That's embarrassing. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is embarrassing? That's in the Library of Congress.

1586
05:49:51,560 --> 05:50:10,659
Cars two is in the Library of Congress. Doesn't matter. 86%. What's something that I have not

1587
05:50:10,659 --> 05:50:25,049
done at all? Oh, down here. What about Robocop? Robocop is good, but I wouldn't put that in my

1588
05:50:25,049 --> 05:50:36,169
required reading list. Gorilla's Demon Days and Plastic Beach. Also required reading.

1589
05:50:46,259 --> 05:50:55,930
What else is in there? And Plastic Beach. Yeah, I really like Plastic Beach a lot.

1590
05:50:56,650 --> 05:51:02,459
A lot. I thought it was fantastic. A lot of people might not agree with that, but

1591
05:51:03,180 --> 05:51:08,619
I think that's... It's really easy to say Demon Days is the best album, but I think Plastic

1592
05:51:08,619 --> 05:51:13,939
Beach is. I know people are going to be like, no fucking way, but I just really... Replayability,

1593
05:51:13,939 --> 05:51:19,319
re-listenability. I've listened to Plastic Beach's songs more than I have Demon Days.

1594
05:51:21,580 --> 05:51:30,310
And Demon Days is just a rock solid. Just absolute banger after banger. But for some reason,

1595
05:51:30,310 --> 05:51:56,860
Plastic Beach just did it more for me. I don't know why. 89. I mean, I think that arrow,

1596
05:51:57,540 --> 05:52:01,779
Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Gorilla's, I think that's the best. That's when they were at their

1597
05:52:01,779 --> 05:52:14,709
absolute peak. That's not to say that I didn't like humans, but Plastic Beach and Demon Days

1598
05:52:14,709 --> 05:52:25,900
are way better. Song Machine is good too. I actually haven't really given it much listen.

1599
05:52:25,900 --> 05:52:37,849
I'll have to do that. I liked that single they came out with. What was it called? Humility?

1600
05:52:43,270 --> 05:52:47,029
I like that song.

1601
05:52:53,080 --> 05:53:19,799
That was really good. That's from the Now Now. I actually... People were really mixed on

1602
05:53:19,799 --> 05:53:50,540
Saturn bars. I really liked it. I thought it was really good. 91%. This one is the longest out of

1603
05:53:50,540 --> 05:54:00,340
all of them. I like Moments was good too. Moments was just all... It was just super. When you put

1604
05:54:00,340 --> 05:54:23,779
Moments on it, my whole body would just move. I'm so happy De La Soul continued to do stuff

1605
05:54:23,779 --> 05:54:31,180
with the Gorilla's. They're so good. A lot of times, the Gorilla's will have that one-off

1606
05:54:31,900 --> 05:54:34,060
where it's like, oh yeah, they were on that Gorilla's album that one time,

1607
05:54:34,060 --> 05:54:52,549
but De La Soul is just on every album. I love it. What am I missing? There's a lot of places

1608
05:54:52,549 --> 05:55:02,139
I'm missing. Where is it? Trash. Lou Reed collab with them too. Yeah, what was the Lou Reed song?

1609
05:55:02,700 --> 05:55:14,810
I forget what it was. It was in Plastic Beach, right? Yeah, it was Plastic Beach. Oh yeah,

1610
05:55:14,810 --> 05:55:29,209
some kind of nature. That's right. I love Stylo too though. Stylo was awesome. That was a driving

1611
05:55:29,209 --> 05:56:09,479
song. It really was. Bruce Willis video was rad. Yeah, it was. Now you make me want to listen to

1612
05:56:09,479 --> 05:56:24,540
the Gorilla's. I love to do that with my cheesy Gordita Crunch. Is this already clean? Kind of.

1613
05:56:24,540 --> 05:56:44,680
Different nozzle. That's the problem. There it is. It sounds like the Dr. House song.

1614
05:56:44,680 --> 05:56:56,680
It's a song called Teardrop, right? Can I play this for a second on stream? Are we allowed to

1615
05:56:56,680 --> 05:57:04,069
enjoy anything in 2021? Am I allowed to make a reference to any media I've ever watched and

1616
05:57:04,069 --> 05:57:09,139
thought was cool to share with anybody? No? I have to lock myself in my fucking room, turn the lights

1617
05:57:09,139 --> 05:57:13,060
off, close all the windows, put headphones on and not tell anybody I ever listen to it.

1618
05:57:13,700 --> 05:57:34,970
I would play it right now. What the fuck? Whatever. Oh, this is very dirty under here.

1619
05:57:39,130 --> 05:57:51,319
This is a lot of fun. This is very therapeutic. If you're looking for a game that's just

1620
05:57:51,319 --> 05:58:02,759
therapeutic. This is one of them. This is fun. I like this. This is early access. I wonder what

1621
05:58:02,759 --> 05:58:15,029
they're going to put in the full game. I'm curious. It doesn't need to be anything else, right? It

1622
05:58:15,029 --> 05:58:30,659
knows exactly what it is. That's what it's going to give you. That's it. Almost 1K in the bank.

1623
05:58:30,659 --> 05:58:45,130
Almost. Wait, this is genuinely a waste of life. Wait, what are you talking about? What?

1624
05:58:51,419 --> 05:58:54,939
I'm just spraying some walls, man. I'm just hanging out, man.

1625
05:58:59,779 --> 05:59:13,830
You can say that about anything. Why have you not played the Bugsnax LST? I don't think I can. I

1626
05:59:13,830 --> 05:59:36,540
think that song is copyright, isn't it? It's a waste of life. What the fuck? Let's go with the big one.

1627
05:59:36,540 --> 05:59:48,540
I think this is, yeah, that's fine. Okay. Well, there it goes. IRL power washing stream. When?

1628
05:59:48,540 --> 05:59:55,220
Nope. I'll keep it in the head. I'll keep it up here. You might see it eventually. I think that'd

1629
05:59:55,220 --> 06:00:19,509
be fun. Almost done. Man, this is a pain in the ass. This one doesn't want to go. I've got to get

1630
06:00:19,509 --> 06:00:34,979
the other side. How am I going to get that? Are we going to get into through the ages stream?

1631
06:00:36,680 --> 06:00:43,180
I don't know. That was kind of fun for a little while. Maybe. That was pretty fun. Maybe we should

1632
06:00:43,180 --> 06:00:53,240
do that. A lot more people here now than were here before. I'll give you some context. Those

1633
06:00:53,240 --> 06:00:57,400
that don't know what we're talking about. So through the ages stream was, there was a website

1634
06:00:57,400 --> 06:01:02,520
that was made that pulled every single stream I've ever done, every single video I've ever uploaded,

1635
06:01:03,240 --> 06:01:10,970
and it picked a random timestamp randomly across one of those places. So it randomly picked the

1636
06:01:10,970 --> 06:01:16,740
video and then randomly picked the timestamp. And the idea was we were supposed to see what we got.

1637
06:01:17,380 --> 06:01:26,060
I did it with channel points. I don't think I'll even do it with channel points this time.

1638
06:01:26,060 --> 06:01:31,110
It'll probably just be like five minutes. Just five minutes or 10 minutes it just switches

1639
06:01:31,110 --> 06:01:47,799
automatically. I'm gonna get up. Is there a ladder? What about another royalty-free movie night? Yeah,

1640
06:01:47,799 --> 06:01:52,040
I'd want to make sure that the movies were good and not just, because the movies we watched were

1641
06:01:52,040 --> 06:02:03,959
funny. Is there any more Ritz Brothers movies? That's all I care about. It can't be Bionicle.

1642
06:02:03,959 --> 06:02:10,659
I looked into it. That's like a copywritten movie. I can't broadcast that. Even if it's free on the

1643
06:02:10,659 --> 06:02:16,819
internet, I don't have the rights to broadcast it. I need something that there are no rights holders.

1644
06:02:17,540 --> 06:02:24,419
There are still people that own the rights to all the media around Bionicle. I can't stream it.

1645
06:02:24,979 --> 06:02:41,990
Do it anyways. Oh, okay. All right. Well, I'll see when the channel gets deleted.

1646
06:02:42,549 --> 06:02:47,240
It was a good run. Should I throw it all away for Bionicle? What do you think?

1647
06:02:47,240 --> 06:03:04,500
I mean, that'd be kind of a hilarious last stream ever. That would be lame as hell if that was my

1648
06:03:04,500 --> 06:03:24,119
final stream. I mean, it kind of would be. What if you did it with Joe Biden? What would, how would

1649
06:03:24,119 --> 06:03:30,549
they, what would, they wouldn't be able to do anything but about the president. I'm not going

1650
06:03:30,549 --> 06:03:47,270
to stream this. Just make a movie and watch it. I mean, I made a thousand YouTube videos.

1651
06:03:47,990 --> 06:04:09,610
We've watched a bunch of those already. When is Otto's Pogtastic Adventure? I don't know. I have

1652
06:04:09,610 --> 06:04:26,310
to make it. Streamer videos, resident sleeper. Everybody's entitled to their opinion. You can

1653
06:04:26,310 --> 06:04:31,020
have that. You can, you can think my shit sucks if you want. That's fine. I'm not going to combat you

1654
06:04:31,020 --> 06:04:38,950
on that. You are free to have an opinion, which you have. I can't change that. All I can do is

1655
06:04:38,950 --> 06:04:54,200
say thanks for watching. Thanks for coming here. Thanks for spending your day here. I was going to

1656
06:04:54,200 --> 06:04:59,000
scream. I was going to just scream like, get the fuck out of it. I was going to scream it.

1657
06:04:59,000 --> 06:05:05,380
My voice is already kind of fucked up and I thought it might've scared a bunch of people.

1658
06:05:05,380 --> 06:05:21,540
So I didn't do it. Some people are probably actually lying down right now and I don't want

1659
06:05:21,540 --> 06:05:34,900
to scream in their ear. Shit, I got to move the ladder. Wait, no, I don't. Can I just get up here?

1660
06:05:35,540 --> 06:06:01,130
Some people are probably asleep. Should we like fuck with their dreams? How do we do that? Like,

1661
06:06:01,130 --> 06:06:09,939
just talk about how they're asleep right now. You're asleep right now. You sleeping right now. I

1662
06:06:09,939 --> 06:06:17,400
know you're asleep. Wake up for a sec. Look around you. This is a dream. Don't worry. This is a dream.

1663
06:06:17,400 --> 06:06:31,130
It's me, Derma, talking to you. Sleeping. Make sure you take the trash out. Go back to bed now.

1664
06:06:31,130 --> 06:06:35,380
I don't have anything funny to say. I thought I might have something funny to say, but I didn't

1665
06:06:35,380 --> 06:06:42,889
come up with anything quick enough. So I told you to do a small chore. Go back to bed. This is a

1666
06:06:42,970 --> 06:07:05,720
dream. It's a dream. Don't worry. You're fine. It's a dream. 20,455. 20,460. 20,466. 20,600.

1667
06:07:08,090 --> 06:07:16,330
Oh, get me off. I can't take it. That's not a prime number. Whatever. I don't know. I don't

1668
06:07:16,330 --> 06:07:30,090
know prime numbers. Put on forest sound effects. Make them think they're in the woods. Put an ocean

1669
06:07:30,090 --> 06:07:34,009
sound effect. Hey, you're asleep right now and you're in the ocean. All right. Yeah. Let's

1670
06:07:34,009 --> 06:07:50,520
make them think they're in the ocean. Hey there. It's me, Derma985 on the beach with you.

1671
06:07:51,159 --> 06:07:56,139
This is a dream. Don't worry. Don't get up. Just take in the salty air.

1672
06:07:56,700 --> 06:08:10,040
Hear the seagulls. Ah, it's so fresh out here. Don't you think? What I want you to do is I want

1673
06:08:10,040 --> 06:08:17,740
you to let go. Anything negative that you're thinking of is the waves. And you and me here,

1674
06:08:18,299 --> 06:08:27,049
when you wake from your sleep, don't get up. Don't get up. It's okay. You're going to go

1675
06:08:27,770 --> 06:08:35,290
to twitch.tv slash Derma985. If you're not already, which you have to be because you're

1676
06:08:35,290 --> 06:08:48,680
here with me in a dream. Ah, you're going to. I was going to say sub to me and shit,

1677
06:08:48,680 --> 06:08:56,180
but I don't want to do that. It's still a dream. Don't it's you're still in a dream.

1678
06:08:56,740 --> 06:09:07,340
Look at the boat go by. Wow. Watch the seagulls. Look above you. They just flew up one shit in my

1679
06:09:07,340 --> 06:09:23,979
mouth. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, don't get up right now. You're still in a dream.

1680
06:09:24,619 --> 06:09:34,470
When you rise, I want you to just have a new clean day, clear day, clear head after this.

1681
06:09:34,470 --> 06:09:43,450
You're going to watch Derma's streams. He's so good. He's so funny. He's like the funniest guy

1682
06:09:43,450 --> 06:09:52,180
on Twitch. And continue to watch. He's like your favorite. Let's hear the waves and my voice.

1683
06:09:52,819 --> 06:09:59,610
I snap my fingers. You're going to wake up and you're going to act like a chicken.

1684
06:10:01,819 --> 06:10:20,389
The audience is going to laugh in three, two, one. You're up. You're up. I don't know, man.

1685
06:10:20,389 --> 06:10:24,389
I was going to do like the sub thing, but like I got caught halfway through and I just,

1686
06:10:24,389 --> 06:10:43,189
it felt very ugly and I didn't want to do it. Fuck, fuck. Oh, everybody's laughing. I can't

1687
06:10:43,189 --> 06:10:52,889
believe it. He's doing a chicken. He's doing a chicken noise. Statistically, you have at least

1688
06:10:52,889 --> 06:11:01,380
one celebrity fan. Who do you think it is? It's you. So I got to figure out who you are.

1689
06:11:03,299 --> 06:11:06,740
You are literally the celebrity in your underwear watching the stream right now.

1690
06:11:08,580 --> 06:11:12,180
And you asked me that question. So I wonder who you are. I'm going to say,

1691
06:11:20,009 --> 06:11:38,520
who would word it like that? The Grinch? The Grinch is not a person.

1692
06:11:39,509 --> 06:11:56,490
It's a character that an actor plays. It's not Vin Diesel. No, it's not. No, who is it then?

1693
06:11:56,490 --> 06:12:02,580
I don't know. Who is that? Yeah. You know what? It's probably like a senator or something. It's

1694
06:12:02,580 --> 06:12:16,259
probably, it's probably like a congressman or like a congresswoman or something. And it's probably

1695
06:12:16,259 --> 06:12:37,369
like a congressman that you would not expect. Dave State. It's Mitch McConnell. I was asleep

1696
06:12:37,930 --> 06:12:43,610
during German on at fives as well as a stream. And he was very, very kind to me.

1697
06:12:43,610 --> 06:12:57,849
And he told me to be the best I can. So what I've decided is I've decided that there will be no more

1698
06:12:59,380 --> 06:13:09,909
stimulus. We don't need another stimulus. I've decided to stimulate German's bank account

1699
06:13:09,909 --> 06:13:19,740
by providing $200 million to his bank account. All in favor of that stimulus, say aye.

1700
06:13:19,740 --> 06:13:56,970
That's not even how it works. Don't you have to vote? Mitch McConnell. Guys, I don't think

1701
06:13:56,970 --> 06:14:00,569
it's Mitch McConnell. I think Mitch McConnell still has trouble opening up web browsers.

1702
06:14:00,569 --> 06:14:13,750
I think Mitch McConnell still needs to call his son to ask him how, like, Microsoft Network still

1703
06:14:13,750 --> 06:14:32,939
works. Like, yeah, I would feel like he has like an MSN account, don't you? Mitch McConnell's the

1704
06:14:32,939 --> 06:14:53,639
kind of guy that has like an at AOL email. All right, what's left? Okay, the monkey bars,

1705
06:14:54,279 --> 06:15:08,009
tools, the bin. What bin? The trash bin? What's wrong with this? Is it the back? Oh,

1706
06:15:08,009 --> 06:15:19,529
shit. It's up there. This place looks pretty good. I can't wait to see the time lapse.

1707
06:15:19,529 --> 06:15:42,419
There's a second bin. I'll go look. And by the way, what level of celebrity are you guys talking

1708
06:15:42,419 --> 06:15:49,900
about? Are you talking about an A list celebrity? Are you talking about like a person of interest

1709
06:15:49,900 --> 06:15:54,459
or something? Like an A list. I don't know if any A list celebrities watch this stream.

1710
06:16:03,400 --> 06:16:13,400
You think it's Tom Holland? I don't think so. I don't know. Might be. Imagine if I imagine ever

1711
06:16:13,400 --> 06:16:17,479
meeting somebody like a comic con or something. Oh, yeah. Like at the autograph signing or

1712
06:16:17,479 --> 06:16:25,479
something. It's like, Oh, hey, Mitch McConnell. Oh, Mitch McConnell. Wow. I can't believe you're

1713
06:16:25,479 --> 06:16:33,159
at Comic Con. I mean, I may as well be being a rubber mask. I might be a scary monster. But

1714
06:16:33,400 --> 06:16:47,619
I may as well be a scary guy. So Tom Holland. I fucked up the whole thing. Going up to Tom

1715
06:16:47,619 --> 06:16:51,540
Holland at Comic Con or something and getting something signed. And then being like, Oh,

1716
06:16:51,540 --> 06:16:58,419
here you go. What's the name? The name? Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy. Oh, yeah. And he leans in and

1717
06:16:58,419 --> 06:17:13,880
just whispers into my ear, I love that Mitch McConnell voice. What would I do? I love that

1718
06:17:13,880 --> 06:17:34,970
Mitch McConnell voice you do. Hang out with me. Should I scream that? What's left? Oh, over there.

1719
06:17:34,970 --> 06:17:46,580
Okay. I'd be like, Oh, Spider-Man is my favorite character. Spider-Man is my favorite character.

1720
06:17:46,580 --> 06:17:53,299
I love Spider-Man. Spider-Man is my favorite character. And he'd go, All right, man. And I'd

1721
06:17:53,299 --> 06:17:58,580
be like, Oh, it's me, Mitch McConnell. I can't do it. Hold on. Miss Damien. I can't. You liked it,

1722
06:17:58,580 --> 06:18:12,700
though. I love Spider-Man. I would have to do his favorite character in front of him. I would get

1723
06:18:12,700 --> 06:18:17,500
it so wrong. I would be so choked up like this. I wouldn't be able to do anything. But I would

1724
06:18:17,500 --> 06:18:20,220
have to do another character instead. I'd be like, You like Mitch McConnell, but I'll give you another

1725
06:18:20,220 --> 06:18:37,349
one. Here's SpongeBob. And security just grabs me. And then somebody a week later comes in with a

1726
06:18:37,349 --> 06:18:44,180
username. Nice SpongeBob, LOL. Nice SpongeBob impression, LOL. And I know it's him. That's

1727
06:18:44,180 --> 06:19:03,529
their username. Oh, it's inside. This is a huge fan fiction. No, it's not. This is not real. This

1728
06:19:03,529 --> 06:19:20,979
is just make believe of nothing. Self-insert fanfic. Yeah, I know. Whatever. What's not clean?

1729
06:19:22,860 --> 06:19:46,889
Stools. What else? Uh, the bars. That's the only factual thing you've heard me say in this stream

1730
06:19:46,889 --> 06:19:53,770
so far. Is the cheesy Godita crunch is the best item at Taco Bell. And that we need to redo our

1731
06:19:53,770 --> 06:20:06,180
education system. Those are the only two things I've said that are real. What is left? A bench.

1732
06:20:06,180 --> 06:20:23,799
Which one? Underneath? This one? No, it's the other one, right? So what about when you said you never

1733
06:20:23,799 --> 06:20:32,180
pooed your diaper? I did probably a lot. I did probably all the time. When I was one. A lot of

1734
06:20:32,180 --> 06:20:36,419
you guys don't want to hear this, but you probably have filled, you yourself, you listening to this

1735
06:20:36,419 --> 06:20:42,090
right now, have filled probably two to three thousand diapers of shit. You don't want to

1736
06:20:42,090 --> 06:21:11,849
hear that though. But you did. What do you mean question marks? Oh, almost there. I have 1,160.

1737
06:21:15,540 --> 06:21:27,659
Oh, cool. What about you throwing up orange juice on the floor? Yes, that was real. Golf cart.

1738
06:21:28,220 --> 06:21:40,970
This will be quick. This will be really quick. Give me the big one. Give me the, uh, no. Should

1739
06:21:41,049 --> 06:22:07,189
I just spray? This should do it. Yeah, this will be quick. Okay. I got to get the other nozzle.

1740
06:22:07,830 --> 06:22:14,759
You said you missed the whole screen because your Wi-Fi died. Oh shit. I'm sorry.

1741
06:22:25,560 --> 06:22:46,549
But mud. Get it. Who covered the cart in cheese? I think what the actual question is who took the

1742
06:22:46,549 --> 06:23:31,990
cart off-roading? Jackass. Johnny Knoxville. Maybe it's Johnny Knoxville. You're gonna do

1743
06:23:31,990 --> 06:23:41,000
more VR streams? I am gonna do more VR streams. That's coming up soon. I actually think I might be

1744
06:23:41,799 --> 06:23:50,250
getting an index because the Vive is, I like my Vive, but I broke the controller. So I need to

1745
06:23:50,250 --> 06:23:56,520
get the knuckle controllers anyways. I think I kind of want to upgrade. So I'll probably just,

1746
06:23:56,520 --> 06:24:06,220
I'll probably donate the one I have now to another one because I had the original Vive,

1747
06:24:06,860 --> 06:24:15,770
not the Vive Pro or the new one. That, I think that was the original Vive.

1748
06:24:16,490 --> 06:24:32,650
I'll probably get an index. Isn't there another one? What's it called? There's another one that's

1749
06:24:32,650 --> 06:25:10,330
coming out too. Isn't there? Wait, 1250? Well, all right. I have enough. The Oculus Quest 2 is good,

1750
06:25:10,330 --> 06:25:17,930
but requires Facebook. And the Reverb G2 is supposedly really good too. I'll probably just

1751
06:25:17,930 --> 06:25:23,369
get the index. I feel like that's the one to get if you were going to get one. All right. Medium duty.

1752
06:25:23,369 --> 06:25:33,610
Here we go. Surface more, more, more. Oily ingrained. What's that do? All right. So now I

1753
06:25:33,610 --> 06:25:44,419
already got the attachments for it, right? So now I got this detached house. This place is huge.

1754
06:25:44,979 --> 06:25:51,740
Reverb G2 is great when WMR decides to work properly. Index is a goodbye if you're just

1755
06:25:51,740 --> 06:26:04,069
going to do strange stuff. Okay. All right. So where, where's my, where's my new nozzle?

1756
06:26:04,630 --> 06:26:21,619
Just bought it. Where is it? Isn't it one of these ones here? Medium duty, the Urban XU2.

1757
06:26:22,180 --> 06:26:35,610
I own the attachment. Where is it? I didn't equip it. How do I equip it? Oh, E. Okay. And we'll do

1758
06:26:35,610 --> 06:26:48,569
the extension. Ooh, that's better. All right. I think I should be able to do this now, right?

1759
06:26:59,029 --> 06:27:18,470
Looks like a gas tank. It's not optimal. I like going side to side. It's much better for my brain.

1760
06:27:29,060 --> 06:27:57,669
Yeah. What the fuck? This thing sucks. I just take it off. This thing sucks. Dope. Oh shit.

1761
06:27:57,669 --> 06:28:01,750
That's right. I should do soap. Oh, I don't have the soap nozzle. It's like 500 bucks.

1762
06:28:11,290 --> 06:28:41,990
Even this, maybe this is just really dirty. Shoot closer. It's the distance.

1763
06:28:42,709 --> 06:29:33,459
It is kind of distance, isn't it? All right. Not bad. Nice. There we go. Looks better. Change the

1764
06:29:33,459 --> 06:29:41,740
radio. Oh, about. All right. This, this is probably going to be the last thing we do

1765
06:29:41,740 --> 06:29:46,569
after this house. I'd probably call it. What's, um, what's a good one?

1766
06:29:56,540 --> 06:30:03,740
Ape escape. Oh, I like plants versus zombies. That's a good one. That's a good one.

1767
06:30:03,740 --> 06:30:18,740
All right. Let's go. We're zombies. We're coming.

1768
06:30:28,180 --> 06:30:43,740
And if only they made the second game, not a never ending cash grab or pop cap. Pop cap had

1769
06:30:43,740 --> 06:30:52,569
so many cool games. Can you imagine not making an insane aquarium? Another one. Why won't they make

1770
06:30:52,569 --> 06:30:56,490
another one? Why would they not have met? I would have rather taken the pay to win insane aquarium.

1771
06:31:05,380 --> 06:31:12,310
They just leaned so heavy into plants versus zombies. It made like five games of plants versus

1772
06:31:12,310 --> 06:31:43,750
zombies. It's like, I, I will give me something else. It's my favorite PS2 game. Um, what is my

1773
06:31:43,750 --> 06:32:07,369
favorite PS2 game? Oh, I don't know. I don't think so. Favorite PS2 game. I don't remember a lot of

1774
06:32:07,369 --> 06:32:31,139
PS2. I really don't because I have my favorite N64 game. It was no mercy. WWF no mercy. That was

1775
06:32:31,139 --> 06:32:56,680
probably my favorite game of that whole generation. This thing actually is much more powerful. I like

1776
06:32:56,680 --> 06:33:29,110
it. All right. That's that. Let's go back to this one. This is going a lot smoother. I'm already at

1777
06:33:29,110 --> 06:33:47,930
10%. It's going way smoother. Are you going to make a TikTok account? I'm not going to make a

1778
06:33:47,930 --> 06:33:55,020
TikTok account. So sorry. All of you anxiously anticipating a TikTok account. You're not going

1779
06:33:55,020 --> 06:34:14,250
to get it. Already 10, 11%. Holy shit. No, no TikTok. I'm not making any more accounts or any

1780
06:34:14,250 --> 06:34:20,220
more platforms. I'll tell you, I got to be honest with everybody here. This is it. I ain't moving

1781
06:34:20,220 --> 06:34:26,259
again. I went from YouTube to Twitch. I'm not going from Twitch to like TikTok or something.

1782
06:34:26,900 --> 06:34:57,770
No, this is it. This is where the story ends. I got to get the ladder for that one. Oh, that's caked

1783
06:34:57,770 --> 06:35:10,009
on there. Was that ink? That's really caked on there. Check this out. Oof, really caked on there.

1784
06:35:10,569 --> 06:35:59,020
There we go. End's dirty. I can't get up there. How old am I again? 35. Good. Good. Very good.

1785
06:35:59,020 --> 06:36:20,459
Very good. Very good. I like it. Give me the ding. Come on. I need the ladder. Where's the ladder on

1786
06:36:20,459 --> 06:36:41,450
this level? I'm asking you like you guys know. All right. There we go. Ladder. This is a pretty

1787
06:36:41,450 --> 06:37:00,299
good spot. How do you fast forward? You can't. I'm sorry. You have to suffer through me playing a

1788
06:37:00,380 --> 06:37:20,139
chores game. These are my favorite games. You know it. I know it. We all know it. Go to the swirl.

1789
06:37:29,139 --> 06:38:02,569
Did they actually make them that do this? That's kind of cool. This is a big house. God. Celebrity

1790
06:38:02,569 --> 06:38:12,889
that watches him is Chuck E. Cheese. Chuck E. Cheese is not an A-list celebrity. Chuck E. Cheese

1791
06:38:12,889 --> 06:38:18,490
is one of those people that they get to be on like one of the seasons of Survivor or something.

1792
06:38:18,490 --> 06:38:33,290
You know what I mean? It's like, oh yeah, I remember you. He's famous. He's a celebrity,

1793
06:38:33,290 --> 06:38:41,939
but he's not an A-list celebrity. No, no, no. I didn't say I hate Chuck E. Cheese. I just said

1794
06:38:41,939 --> 06:38:49,529
he's not an A-list celebrity. I'm not an A-list celebrity. And look, Chuck E. Cheese is way more

1795
06:38:49,529 --> 06:39:16,740
famous and popular than I am. He would get invited onto Survivor. I wouldn't. Who covered for you?

1796
06:39:16,740 --> 06:39:35,700
What do you mean covered for me? What do you mean he covered for me? What did he cover me for?

1797
06:39:36,340 --> 06:40:11,819
Fun fact, you can hear zombies on your lawn here. That's a pretty fun fact. Liar. Celebrity tier list.

1798
06:40:15,080 --> 06:40:39,849
But what would that even mean? Like who do I think is the coolest celebrity? Who's the most famous

1799
06:40:39,849 --> 06:40:58,310
celebrity? It's probably Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is an S, I think. Brad Pitt. Yeah, S. It's Brad Pitt and

1800
06:40:58,310 --> 06:41:34,700
Tom Hanks. Brad Pitt is absolutely an S tier. Don't even tell me that. Of course he is. But Joe Biden.

1801
06:41:34,700 --> 06:41:50,009
Joe Biden is a politician. If you're a politician, you're already a known person

1802
06:41:50,009 --> 06:41:54,009
because you're a politician. We're talking about people that are like movie and TV show actors.

1803
06:41:55,130 --> 06:42:15,369
Tom Cruise. Yep. Kenneth Paltrow. I don't know. Not so much. Not so much really anymore. I don't

1804
06:42:15,369 --> 06:42:27,509
think. No. Jennifer Aniston. I would put probably an S tier. Yeah, Jennifer Aniston is probably S

1805
06:42:27,509 --> 06:42:46,169
tier. George Clooney. Who-ing Jennifer Aniston. What are you talking about? One of the most famous

1806
06:42:46,169 --> 06:43:11,020
people ever. Where does Kathy Mitchell go though? I would be more happy and more starstruck meeting

1807
06:43:11,020 --> 06:43:24,040
Kathy Mitchell than Jennifer Aniston. I'm serious. I would be nervous around Kathy Mitchell.

1808
06:43:46,060 --> 06:43:48,220
Kids, I have a surprise for you.

1809
06:43:55,130 --> 06:43:59,610
The following is a paid advertisement for the Express Ready, Set, Go! brought to you by GT

1810
06:43:59,610 --> 06:44:05,130
Direct, Lewisville, Colorado. We don't have time in our busy lives to wait for food,

1811
06:44:05,130 --> 06:44:10,569
so we fall into the fast food rut or buy carb-filled snacks. Well, millions have

1812
06:44:10,569 --> 06:44:16,810
discovered the secret. I love this lady. She's one of the best entertainers, one of the best hosts

1813
06:44:16,810 --> 06:44:24,650
ever. Even desserts. All thanks to the original Express 101. What would you say? Here comes Kathy

1814
06:44:24,650 --> 06:44:37,529
Mitchell. What's his name? Mama Farigno. Mama Farigno. What's his name? Joe Farigno and Kathy

1815
06:44:37,529 --> 06:44:53,130
Mitchell. Introduce them already. Introduce them. Oh, look at how good that looks.

1816
06:44:54,650 --> 06:45:00,009
You select for your family. This is possible thanks to breakthrough design advances.

1817
06:45:00,009 --> 06:45:06,490
All right. Well, where is she? This is just resident sleeper until we get to.

1818
06:45:10,250 --> 06:45:18,779
The Express Ready, Set, Go! Just like millions of you, the Express 101 is always there for me.

1819
06:45:19,659 --> 06:45:29,740
Joe Farigno. Joe Farago. It's not Kathy Mitchell.

1820
06:45:30,220 --> 06:45:34,700
Yes.

1821
06:45:43,819 --> 06:45:48,700
What a star. She's an S tier.

1822
06:45:48,939 --> 06:45:53,900
And look at these pies. Blueberry, even cherry. You couldn't do that before. You've improved

1823
06:45:53,900 --> 06:46:04,860
on perfection. I think we've made it even more perfect. Come on, Joe. She's S tier. I would

1824
06:46:04,860 --> 06:46:11,130
watch this whole thing right now. I don't know if I can. This is the Express Ready, Set, Go!

1825
06:46:11,130 --> 06:46:16,330
Well, Kathy, this is beautiful. And it is ready. Look what we've done. We took out that center

1826
06:46:16,330 --> 06:46:20,409
divider. So now you have 25% more cooking area. Can I watch this? Is this going to be right?

1827
06:46:20,409 --> 06:46:24,650
Exactly right. I just think Kathy Mitchell is fantastic. I really do.

1828
06:46:24,650 --> 06:46:28,970
Now, this is my almost instant pizza dough. And the recipe comes with it. All you have to do is

1829
06:46:28,970 --> 06:46:33,209
pop it in there and then put one over the other. And I like to call it a pizza cookie. Yeah,

1830
06:46:33,209 --> 06:46:39,290
I call it a cookie pizza. Where is it? I make a cookie, make a pizza. I call it a cookie pizza.

1831
06:46:39,290 --> 06:46:52,409
Come on, where is it? I call it a pizza. Where is it? It's my favorite line.

1832
06:46:52,409 --> 06:47:26,569
Kathy Mitchell is S tier. I would rather, I would pay a thousand dollars to like meet

1833
06:47:26,569 --> 06:47:45,740
and greet Kathy Mitchell versus, I don't care about any other celebrity. Why? Because I,

1834
06:47:45,740 --> 06:48:01,619
she's cool. And she's so good on camera too. She's so quick. She's so good on camera.

1835
06:48:01,619 --> 06:48:31,830
You can't teach that. She's so natural in front of the camera. Can we pay you a thousand dollars

1836
06:48:31,830 --> 06:48:37,750
to stop talking about the infomercial lady? It's been five minutes. I've been, what do you,

1837
06:48:37,750 --> 06:48:59,779
it's been, I'll tell you, Kathy Mitchell was very, very comforting. I remember being,

1838
06:48:59,779 --> 06:49:06,180
I don't care. I don't care. I'm talking about it. I remember a lot of these, these Kathy Mitchell

1839
06:49:06,180 --> 06:49:12,009
infomercials would air at one, two, three o'clock in the morning. And this is back,

1840
06:49:12,009 --> 06:49:15,849
I think when I was in high school and college and stuff, it was so comforting to hear Kathy

1841
06:49:15,849 --> 06:49:21,159
Mitchell's voice. It was, watch them. It was so nice. It was wonderful. Just having to go

1842
06:49:21,159 --> 06:49:53,000
fall asleep to it. Yeah, it was great. Anytime whenever I was like half asleep and I'd be like,

1843
06:49:53,080 --> 06:49:57,479
and now coming up next, ready, set, go. And I'd be like, hold on. She in this one?

1844
06:49:58,200 --> 06:50:02,470
And if it wasn't, I'd be like, nah, I changed channel. But if it's like, and you're coming up

1845
06:50:02,470 --> 06:50:07,110
weird, we have our resident host, Kathy Mitchell. And I'd be like, put it on, turn the volume up

1846
06:50:07,110 --> 06:50:24,779
higher. And now you have my attention. I'm honest. I probably really am Kathy Mitchell's number one

1847
06:50:24,779 --> 06:50:37,189
fan. I don't think anybody else can say that. I think just me. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

1848
06:50:37,750 --> 06:50:44,950
No, I'm fucking fine. Everybody relax. I just think an introversial lady is cool. What's wrong

1849
06:50:44,950 --> 06:51:03,740
with that? What's wrong with that? Why is everybody treating me like I'm crazy? Shit.

1850
06:51:13,560 --> 06:51:47,740
I can't even. All right, let's go. Oh God. Whatever. I got to get this hole on the side.

1851
06:51:47,740 --> 06:52:13,779
This house is so dirty. Did a fucking volcano erupt on their house?

1852
06:52:30,860 --> 06:52:33,740
No, this is from years of not cleaning the roof.

1853
06:52:38,419 --> 06:52:51,619
Express 101. The Express ready, set, go. The snack master. Kathy Mitchell's dump cakes.

1854
06:52:52,549 --> 06:53:02,740
Kathy Mitchell's dump meals. Kathy Mitchell's copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's square pan.

1855
06:53:04,630 --> 06:53:12,759
Kathy Mitchell's turbo cooker. I've seen them all. All of them. Many times over.

1856
06:53:13,319 --> 06:53:36,680
How many did I buy? None of them. Oh, except I think my family had the snack master. I'm pretty

1857
06:53:36,680 --> 06:54:01,529
sure they did. Fake fan. What are you talking about? What do you mean fake fan? I had the snack master.

1858
06:54:04,330 --> 06:54:10,650
And I had the copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's copper pan. I had it. The only pan I had.

1859
06:54:28,889 --> 06:54:33,290
Your family had it. What do you mean my family had it? I had the copper pan.

1860
06:54:38,360 --> 06:54:44,459
I had the copper pan. I bought the copper pan. Like five years ago. Four or five years ago.

1861
06:54:51,849 --> 06:54:57,689
Show it. I don't have the pan anymore. I stopped using it like six years ago or something. I bought

1862
06:54:57,689 --> 06:55:03,540
it like five years ago. Oh wait, I got caught. Hold on. I bought this pan when I was still in

1863
06:55:03,540 --> 06:55:08,900
Massachusetts. I did not bring the pan to Vegas. It was the copper pan. Kathy Mitchell's face was

1864
06:55:08,900 --> 06:55:20,459
on it. It's not a lie. I'm not lying. I had the Kathy Mitchell copper pan. I only bought it because

1865
06:55:20,459 --> 06:55:53,299
her name was on it. Her face was on it. Yes. 30% that's it. Oh goodness. Buy another one right now.

1866
06:55:53,860 --> 06:56:08,709
No, I don't need it. Actually, I kind of do actually. I could use a new pan. Maybe I'll buy it.

1867
06:56:08,709 --> 06:56:40,650
Maybe I'll get the Kathy Mitchell copper pan again. The big one. There we are. Buy it if you're a real

1868
06:56:40,650 --> 06:56:54,069
fan. I'll probably get it. It was good. It actually worked. Buy the XL square copper pan. Yeah, that's

1869
06:56:54,069 --> 06:57:00,790
the one. My square copper pan is better than all the others. Let me show you. I'm putting two

1870
06:57:00,790 --> 06:57:07,669
tablespoons of teaspoons. I'm adding two cups of flour and a little bit of milk. My copper pan

1871
06:57:07,669 --> 06:57:25,979
is better than all the other pans. Look at that steak. Yeah, I bought it. And they always put a

1872
06:57:25,979 --> 06:57:35,540
piece of cheese in there. Why do they do that? They put one piece of cheddar cheese in the pan

1873
06:57:36,099 --> 06:57:45,000
and they cook the cheese. Who the fuck is cooking cheese in a pan? And as you see, I'm cooking cheese

1874
06:57:45,000 --> 06:57:49,959
in this pan and the cheese does not stick to the bottom. Why are you cooking a piece of cheese?

1875
06:57:50,599 --> 06:58:03,299
To show the quality. That's the point. A grilled cheese. No, but you don't just put a slice of

1876
06:58:03,299 --> 06:58:09,450
cheese in the pan. How many times has this happened to you when you're cooking slices of

1877
06:58:09,450 --> 06:58:24,979
cheese in your pan? To show it will not stick to the pan. To show it doesn't stick. I love when

1878
06:58:24,979 --> 06:58:31,459
that guy says technology too. With anti-stick technology. There's always a technology.

1879
06:58:31,459 --> 06:58:39,020
With vacuum-sealed technology. The word technology in infomercials was the best way to make anybody

1880
06:58:39,020 --> 06:58:47,220
over the age of 70 to pick the phone up and buy it. With true cooking technology. It's a convection

1881
06:58:47,220 --> 06:58:55,349
oven. That's it. The super cooker cooks around all sides with our patented super turbo cooking

1882
06:58:55,349 --> 06:59:05,720
technology. It's a convection oven. Done. Oh, technology. It's got, it's got technology in it.

1883
06:59:05,720 --> 06:59:22,200
I'll call that number right now. Hey PeacefulHaley, thanks for the 10 community subs. I think I missed

1884
06:59:22,200 --> 06:59:44,939
a bunch of other subs too. Thank you though. Apparently also works on you. Also, look at it.

1885
06:59:44,939 --> 07:00:01,270
It looks even better already. You won't shut up about it. You're doing E3 next week? I am.

1886
07:00:01,270 --> 07:00:07,060
We're doing the Microsoft conference. So next time you're going to see my face is Saturday

1887
07:00:07,700 --> 07:00:12,259
at the Microsoft conference. Well, I won't be there, but I will be streaming it.

1888
07:00:12,900 --> 07:00:19,099
I've been giving our reactions to things. I wonder what they got in store for us this time.

1889
07:00:25,819 --> 07:00:40,310
Yes, Saturday is a React Andy stream. It is. Is Microsoft Sunday? I thought Microsoft Saturday.

1890
07:00:40,310 --> 07:00:48,549
When is the Microsoft conference? Is it Saturday or Sunday? Got like 10 AM Pacific. Yeah.

1891
07:00:49,529 --> 07:00:52,250
Sunday. Oh, okay. Well, whenever the Microsoft one is, that's what I'm doing.

1892
07:00:52,889 --> 07:01:10,540
No Nintendo? No, Nintendos are usually, they're always like on like a Tuesday or something.

1893
07:01:11,099 --> 07:01:15,419
And they're always like 40 minutes long. And I really don't know what the hell to do afterwards.

1894
07:01:16,060 --> 07:01:30,709
So no, no Nintendo. And it's really early in the morning too. It's like nine, eight or nine

1895
07:01:30,709 --> 07:01:49,259
o'clock in the morning. He hates Nintendo and Luigi. It's not true, but I have not played a

1896
07:01:49,259 --> 07:01:56,200
Nintendo game all the way through since like Mario galaxy. I mean, I guess you can count

1897
07:01:56,200 --> 07:02:02,700
Mario sunshine, but I haven't really played very many Nintendo games all the way through.

1898
07:02:02,700 --> 07:02:11,819
What's the last Nintendo game I really played? Did I, I beat, did I beat Pikmin? Did I complete

1899
07:02:11,819 --> 07:02:32,419
Pikmin? No, I don't think I did. Right. I got the first ending. Oh, well I got like the, yeah,

1900
07:02:32,419 --> 07:02:42,729
the ending, like the first part of the game. I saw an ending. Oh, that game was terrible by the way.

1901
07:02:43,529 --> 07:02:50,040
I was, I was holding in so much, how much I hated that whole game. I wanted to scream so badly about

1902
07:02:50,040 --> 07:02:56,860
how much I just despised playing it. I just held it in though. It's been a lot, enough times

1903
07:02:56,860 --> 07:03:21,400
gone by. I can tell you. I'm kidding. Jesus. I'm kidding. Oh my God. I'm kidding. Don't worry.

1904
07:03:21,959 --> 07:03:54,180
Oh, there's a lot of dirt still. 40% and everyone back to Hades. That was the game. That was my

1905
07:03:54,180 --> 07:04:04,810
game of the year too. Yeah, actual game of the year. And I only played, I played like, I played

1906
07:04:04,810 --> 07:04:12,860
it for like seven and a half hours. Hey, look, I know exactly how good it is. I don't need to

1907
07:04:12,860 --> 07:04:44,549
know anymore. Was it in Half-Life Alyx? Oh yeah, it was. That game was awesome. Half-Life Alyx was

1908
07:04:44,549 --> 07:05:09,270
so good. It was truly a fantastic game. I underrated it? I did? Didn't I say it was the game of the

1909
07:05:09,270 --> 07:05:40,090
year? What'd I give it for a rating? 9.4? That's pretty good. Going higher than a 9.4. I mean,

1910
07:05:40,090 --> 07:05:50,599
that's one of the most, that's one of the best games I've ever played. Having, having to score

1911
07:05:50,599 --> 07:05:57,319
over a 9 means that's one of the best games I've played. What else have I given a 9 in the last

1912
07:05:57,319 --> 07:06:33,860
five years? Minecraft? Makes sense. Minecraft makes sense. House Flipper? That makes sense too.

1913
07:06:40,229 --> 07:06:55,430
What game is a 10 out of 10? I don't know. GTA 4 is probably pretty high. Resident Evil 2 was

1914
07:06:55,430 --> 07:07:21,939
really high, the remake. TF2 would be pretty close as well. Yeah, I don't know though. Bloodborne?

1915
07:07:21,939 --> 07:07:38,709
Bloodborne needs to be 60 FPS. That's the one thing holding it back. I'm not sure I've ever

1916
07:07:38,709 --> 07:07:52,389
played a perfect 10 out of 10. Team Fortress is close. It probably is TF2. I can't think of much

1917
07:07:52,389 --> 07:08:15,979
else that deserves a 10. Chrono Trigger? Yeah, Mario RPG, Chrono Trigger, those are all really good.

1918
07:08:16,540 --> 07:08:47,450
They're all at least 9.5. Is this side over here? And I'm probably going to call it sooner than I

1919
07:08:47,450 --> 07:08:52,169
think. I might not even finish this one. I'm really hungry. I keep thinking of cheesy goudita crunches

1920
07:08:52,169 --> 07:09:10,540
and I want one right now and I want to go eat one. Diablo or WoW Classic? Diablo 2. That's not an

1921
07:09:10,540 --> 07:09:33,959
easy one to answer though. I still think Diablo 2 beats it. My god. Get up there. Diablo 2 is just,

1922
07:09:35,830 --> 07:09:42,299
you don't get better than that. I think Diablo 2 is a 10. Well, Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction.

1923
07:09:42,299 --> 07:10:01,099
That game was so good. Am I going to play the Diablo 2 remake? I mean, probably. I don't know

1924
07:10:01,099 --> 07:10:05,619
if I'm going to stream that though. I'm not sure that, I think that's something that I want to do

1925
07:10:05,619 --> 07:10:15,540
in my own time if I'm going to do it. And then whenever Elden Ring decides to come out, yeah.

1926
07:10:16,180 --> 07:10:32,709
Elaborate? Um, I don't know. I kind of would just want to play D2 on my own.

1927
07:10:34,650 --> 07:10:50,619
Just sit there with my mouth open. That's my McDonald's order. That's uh, it really depends

1928
07:10:50,619 --> 07:10:58,729
on the day, but usually it's uh, it's right now. I'd say it's two McChickens, two McDoubles,

1929
07:11:01,180 --> 07:11:30,520
and a Big Mac, and a five and a six piece nugget, and two cherry pies. Window frame is so

1930
07:11:31,159 --> 07:11:50,659
finicky. There it is. Very good boy. You're a liar. Now it's two McChickens and two McDoubles,

1931
07:11:50,659 --> 07:12:09,529
and then if I'm really, really hungry, I'll get nuggets. Like a six piece. That's not obscene.

1932
07:12:09,529 --> 07:12:16,520
They're not even that big. A McDonald's patty is like two ounces. What's a McDonald's burger patty?

1933
07:12:17,080 --> 07:12:31,720
It's two and a half ounces. It's three ounces, isn't it? It's like a two or three ounce patty.

1934
07:12:32,279 --> 07:12:39,750
You know, there are people that make four, six, five, six, seven ounce patties. It's not a joke.

1935
07:12:39,750 --> 07:12:52,810
What even is a joke? I hate big patties. I think they're gross. If your patty is bigger than your

1936
07:12:52,810 --> 07:13:06,779
bun, you got a problem. There's a problem there. The ratio of meat to bun has to be different.

1937
07:13:07,340 --> 07:13:15,400
Has to be enough where you get, I would say, meat to bun ratio. Like uh, the meat should be

1938
07:13:16,279 --> 07:13:42,139
half as big as the bun. Maybe even a little less. In terms of volume or mass. Um, like thickness.

1939
07:13:42,939 --> 07:13:46,779
Your bun should never be thicker. Uh, you know, your bun should never be the same thickness as

1940
07:13:46,779 --> 07:14:07,209
your meat. Because then all the condiments have to go on. All your lettuce, your, you know, if you

1941
07:14:07,209 --> 07:14:12,009
have tomato, I mean, that's disgusting, but if you put it on there, good for you. You've got your

1942
07:14:12,009 --> 07:14:16,330
cheese. You've got your onion potentially. You've got your chopped onion. Not, not whole onion

1943
07:14:17,689 --> 07:14:49,029
circles. No, thank you. Etch up, mustard, pickles, whatever. That one felt good. You don't like

1944
07:14:49,029 --> 07:14:54,459
tomato? No, I don't, I don't like cold, wet tomato on my hamburger. I like tomato. I just

1945
07:14:54,459 --> 07:14:59,979
don't like it on a hamburger. I don't think it belongs there. All right. The house is clean.

1946
07:14:59,979 --> 07:15:10,549
All right. I'm probably going to call it here. Just don't look at the side of the house. I need

1947
07:15:10,549 --> 07:15:21,659
to go get a, I need to get some food. I'm hungry. I'm going to get to, I got to 50%. Once it's 50%,

1948
07:15:21,659 --> 07:15:27,139
I'll leave. But thanks for watching everybody. This has been Power Washer Simulator. It's very

1949
07:15:27,139 --> 07:15:30,979
good. It's very relaxing. It's very fun. I'm surprised I sat here for seven hours and 15

1950
07:15:30,979 --> 07:15:39,610
minutes. It was a lot of fun. Had a good time. I'll see you guys next week for E3. I'm going to do

1951
07:15:39,610 --> 07:15:55,750
at least the Microsoft conference. We'll see you after that. We'll see you soon. It is my 10 year

1952
07:15:55,750 --> 07:16:01,509
anniversary online on YouTube and Twitch and everything. That's happening I believe on Thursday.

1953
07:16:01,509 --> 07:16:09,979
I'm not, I'm probably not going to go live for it. We'll talk about it at E3. But in case I miss

1954
07:16:09,979 --> 07:16:21,080
you, it's been 10 years officially as of this week. It's been a wild ride. It's been fun.

1955
07:16:23,369 --> 07:16:30,250
We'll talk about it some more this next weekend. Not my birthday yet. All right. Yeah. I'm going

1956
07:16:30,250 --> 07:16:37,500
to call it here. I need some food. I will see you guys on whenever the Microsoft conference is.

1957
07:16:37,500 --> 07:16:43,700
Have a great rest of your week. It's very, very soon here. I'll have a lot more to talk about.

1958
07:16:44,419 --> 07:16:53,430
There's another few projects that are coming up that are going to be in September, August.

1959
07:16:54,069 --> 07:16:58,970
Talked about baseball. Baseball is confirmed. It's a go. It's happening.

1960
07:16:58,970 --> 07:17:06,979
There's a lot of things happening. I hope you think they're interesting. But I'll see you soon.

1961
07:17:06,979 --> 07:17:17,110
Let's transition out of here. Show the credits. Yeah, the baseball stream is confirmed to be

1962
07:17:17,110 --> 07:17:21,909
happening at some point in September. There's another big stream that's happening in August,

1963
07:17:21,909 --> 07:17:32,040
which I'll talk about more later, among a couple other small things. Don't forget about Mizkif.

1964
07:17:32,040 --> 07:17:49,240
Yeah, I'll hit him up. I'll see what the deal is. That might be fun too. When is your Among Us

1965
07:17:49,240 --> 07:17:56,439
stream? Never going to play Among Us. How late to the meme do you guys really want me to be?

1966
07:18:01,610 --> 07:18:19,029
You really want me to be that late to the meme? Two years too late. Yeah, I'm getting Taco Bell.

1967
07:18:19,029 --> 07:18:32,419
I'm into it. Let's do it. Play it the day the servers go down. We'll find that out. We'll find

1968
07:18:32,419 --> 07:18:37,930
the day the servers turn off, and I'll play it on that day. I don't think that's going to happen.

1969
07:18:45,459 --> 07:18:54,279
I really doubt that'll happen. It's still really popular. I think it's a lot more popular than

1970
07:18:54,279 --> 07:19:13,979
you guys are giving it credit for still. Raid Mizkif? All right, we're going to raid Mizkif.

1971
07:19:13,979 --> 07:19:26,779
I mean, we've been talking about him all stream. We might as well go do it. I've been talking about

1972
07:19:26,779 --> 07:19:35,270
him all stream. It's been like seven hours of us talking about him. Go say hello. What is he doing?

1973
07:19:35,270 --> 07:20:00,569
What is he up to? He's doing something. Raid yourself. Go say hi. Look, we've got to at least

1974
07:20:00,569 --> 07:20:09,830
make a... If I'm going to go on that game show thing, whatever it is, schooled, and here's

1975
07:20:09,830 --> 07:20:15,819
an introduction, I guess. I don't know. He's doing something fun. I'll see you guys soon. We'll see

1976
07:20:15,819 --> 07:20:29,020
you next week. Take care of yourselves. Go say hello. Network Andy. Network Andy's back.

1977
07:20:30,299 --> 07:21:26,540
He's back with a vengeance. Take care, guys. See you soon.
