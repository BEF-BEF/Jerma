1
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,179
Perfect timing. I just oh, I didn't have any music playing

2
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,019
perfect timing

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:39,979
F 099 cool. Oh, all right. How do I do it? Just queue up?

4
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:59,509
Your ranking is visible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so I've never played f0. This is actually really fun

5
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,780
I'm really into this. So there's some basics before your first f0.99 race with players from around the world

6
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:16,879
Okay, steer boost accelerate and then sliding just focus on steering

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:27,189
That's how you get health probably. Oh

8
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:44,030
Should I be drifting or something?

9
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:02,840
Okay, boost there's a while accelerating keep in mind boost drains your power run out of power

10
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:16,000
You'll be in danger of crashing out. Oh, I see. It's like an indicator up there

11
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:28,080
But don't use it again

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:45,039
Colliding with barriers and opponents drains power, but you can recharge power in the pit area. Avoid people

13
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,620
Whoa

14
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:01,099
Okay, well that was that wasn't good, okay slide to avoid players

15
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,159
It's a strafe

16
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:24,979
Super sparks drop by gold bumpers and from collisions between machines to fill your super meter

17
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,960
Okay, press a when your super meter is charged to fly on the skyway

18
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,270
Okay, so I need super I need a super boost. Ah

19
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,860
That's cool. You essentially get your own track

20
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:10,270
You fall off of it. No, but you do that with a hundred people. Let's go. You're ready

21
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,169
25 pilot race

22
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:25,920
Okay, let's do it. You got some practice to do. It was my machine. Oh

23
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,839
I want durability

24
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,519
wild goose

25
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm doing wild goose. Okay. So are these real players of these bots?

26
00:04:46,360 --> 00:05:05,279
So what you're saying is I should absolutely come in first place, but go accelerate to avoid slipping around

27
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,060
I was gonna ask that spin attack

28
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:47,889
That's cool. Let's do it. Now. I get it. They don't have coins. Wow

29
00:05:48,689 --> 00:06:09,490
How come they're not golden? Oh, the strafe is actually good to use on turns. Sometimes

30
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:44,319
Just killed that person. My whole face is itchy, but I can't do anything about it. Okay. No, I

31
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,600
Tried

32
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm okay

33
00:06:47,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Cool jump. Okay, so I did it slow down in the pit. I could have slowed down

34
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,819
I just figured I want to keep up pace. I

35
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,620
Did it now it's time for the real players

36
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,399
50 pilot race not quite

37
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:46,199
Task failed successfully. We're good

38
00:07:46,800 --> 00:08:01,629
What is a grip the road with a fast one back speed for 62 for 78?

39
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:11,920
big blue

40
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:24,399
Different track I think starting now. You'll have to finish within the safe rank of each lap to continue

41
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:31,399
Oh, that's I like that. This is cool. I get it now. Okay, try to finish in the top 35

42
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:48,639
Do it. Let's really screw this person's day up

43
00:08:49,159 --> 00:09:30,600
Not bad. Hmm. Is there a break or is it just gas get out of the way?

44
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,419
Oh my goodness get out of the way. You're just ruining everything

45
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,279
Get this shit out of the way

46
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:46,399
Okay, you have to be in 40th place. I'm in first place. I'm good

47
00:09:46,960 --> 00:10:06,120
So this is a way to mess with the person in first place. I get it start passing people. I think very soon here

48
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:23,460
There you are. I don't even need the boost just drive

49
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:49,450
Okay, so you can die I was not aware that you could explode and be out

50
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,980
I thought it was gonna like key to me and just put me back on the track in like 15th place

51
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:30,990
Okay, good to know stay on the road good

52
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:39,460
So if I cross to the next lap, am I eliminating people that are in those bottom places?

53
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:48,240
Is that how that works? Because if you're real you try as hard as you can you just eliminate people. Oh, wow

54
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,960
That's crazy. Okay, cool

55
00:11:49,960 --> 00:12:09,690
Okay, no, all right just drive I'm way ahead of everybody

56
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:38,450
Don't I just somebody else's blew up. I should be pretty far ahead. All right, there we go

57
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,330
People up. All right, we're good. We're good. Fine. That's fine

58
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,399
There's a lot of red. I knew you're gonna hit by that

59
00:12:47,120 --> 00:13:03,019
That was not fair. No stop. Oh my god. What the fuck?

60
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:09,299
You can just get exploded

61
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:18,879
Okay, let's do it turn it up a little I'll turn it up. This is so fun, though

62
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,899
Is that too loud or is that good?

63
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:52,269
Don't even try hard. Why am I trying really hard just wait to the last lap and then boost past everybody in the last two

64
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,269
Seconds, what if I never played a racing game before?

65
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,019
Just stay within ten places

66
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,480
Top ten, you'll be fine

67
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,740
Just look they're all gonna drive into the red things always stay in 10th place

68
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:12,620
Collect all this bullshit

69
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:52,830
Good okay, but I'm 10th place hurt dude. You just gotta do a little bit of an excuse me right there

70
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,070
honey help I

71
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,590
almost have a

72
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:07,799
Super meter. All right. I'll win this right here

73
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:19,019
Watch out for the explosion stay behind let him do it. Let him hit it

74
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:35,049
But watch that turn how we now we punch it. Okay, I get it now. This is fun

75
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:51,100
I should really like this a lot. This is time for the real deal. Your last trial will be a 99 pilot race

76
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,700
final tutorial

77
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:11,429
Feel like I like it's a little more a little more durable. Yeah

78
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:27,309
It's not Mario Kart timing wait until right before the race starts

79
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:36,080
Okay, I'll try it. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry. This thing just almost fell down

80
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:41,950
What is this?

81
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,110
You'll now be racing against rival pilots of similar skill ratings

82
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:52,879
Okay, if you finish with a higher rank than your rival your skill rating will increase

83
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:11,559
Straightaway, I don't think this boost in this one

84
00:17:14,119 --> 00:18:00,450
Good job. It's a rival it is these are boss. You said right still I can't let my rival beat me

85
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:45,759
She's driving like shit and I'm still not ahead of him. There we go. 10th place. That's what I want

86
00:18:46,319 --> 00:19:10,759
It's place. Is that okay? Oh

87
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,119
Two rivals defeated

88
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:30,799
machine

89
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,640
You receive ticket points based on how well you do in each race

90
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:39,680
Collect enough ticket points and you can earn tickets to allow you to enter grand pre and mini pre events

91
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,759
Now this is the real deal. Now. You're ready to race online

92
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,839
You'll need three tickets to be in the grand prix

93
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,390
Special event pro track taking the most dip. No

94
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:20,789
All right. Let's just do it for real. This is it, right? All right, let's go

95
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm gonna stay on wild goose. So what's considered a win? Is it like hearthstone battlegrounds top four top three top five top ten

96
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:52,759
What's considered a win just don't die off 80 does just survive to be honest. Oh, wow. It's that difficult. Okay

97
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:10,769
Oh shit, I'm going against the Joker. All right, I'm gonna try to get in

98
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,809
25th or above place

99
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:33,460
Yeah, this is a mess, but I like it just get all the coins. I'm not doing super boost till the last second

100
00:21:33,859 --> 00:22:18,200
How come nobody drives on the road?

101
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:47,710
85 what place my in people have to be getting pretty low on health. How do I miss that?

102
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:59,380
Alright, somebody's exploded

103
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:15,910
Please oil slicks. Oh, I was avoiding those the whole time. I thought that was oil on the ground now

104
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:22,670
Alright, let me try that again. Now knowing that that's not what that is. I thought it was oil

105
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:35,400
Just survive. Okay, nice

106
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Grand Prix starts in

107
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:48,349
12 minutes. I can do that. I got enough tickets, right? Oh 12 minutes. Okay. Let me practice. I've practiced

108
00:23:49,269 --> 00:24:03,079
try

109
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:31,319
Each race is four or five minutes. Oh for a track big blue. Why not? These are the rivals. We're all C-

110
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:55,240
It's okay. Good luck everybody. All right, I'm just gonna drive and not even worry about anything else. I

111
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:03,180
Didn't get that. He's dead already

112
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:25,210
It's so rich when this it's ridiculous when there's this many people on here

113
00:25:40,680 --> 00:26:38,289
Hey better than last time. Hey, I don't want to die big opportunity here lots of people dying right now

114
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:13,420
All right better than last time 43, I'm a C

115
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,859
driver

116
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:28,519
Drive time for another couple. So what's the strategy to actually get in first place?

117
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,579
Does it just try to get out in front is I'm gonna try that this time

118
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,160
I'm gonna try getting out in front really really quickly use all my boost just get to first place

119
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:58,200
Again, no one to use the highways you kill another you get a full boost

120
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,910
Use the skyway on tight corners

121
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:25,490
It's all about knowing when to boost it's fun regardless though, even if you're in 40th place top 50, that's the bet

122
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:50,829
I could do it again. I'm just gonna stay with the group. It's hard to stay with the group

123
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:26,319
Shit. Oh, I want that. It'll be useful if I can get it

124
00:29:27,519 --> 00:30:01,329
Skip everybody. All right, get it again. I freaked out for a second, but it's fine. Oh

125
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:41,730
I forgot I forgot I forgot I forgot him. I'm dead. Oh, man. I completely didn't repay attention to the bar. I

126
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,839
Completely just I got into complete tunnel vision. It was like just boost to try to get up to like 30

127
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
And what I had it to

128
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:22,130
About this one. So how long do you when you boost for the final time?

129
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:28,940
Are you just susceptible to dying in one hit when you take yourself down to the to zero?

130
00:31:29,180 --> 00:32:01,069
Maybe even just avoid that part. Honestly the very beginning. I

131
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:25,160
Don't overdo it

132
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:34,630
Dead already, dude. All right, so I

133
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:39,740
Got passed by everybody and I drove on the road

134
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,579
I drove like on the correct part of the road and they all blew by me

135
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,029
Okay, if you just boost over it's don't even do turns

136
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:51,119
Yeah, that's what it is. I don't even you don't drive on the real road

137
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:51,579
Yeah, I'm just gonna try to stay alive way too early. All right, I need this bad. Oh, how did it miss?

138
00:33:54,839 --> 00:34:18,000
Wednesday Grand Prix two minutes. Do I have time to wait? I'm gonna wait

139
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,179
I'm gonna get I'm gonna destroy it on this one

140
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:36,309
Go in practice. I

141
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,489
Kind of want to do this though. I want to see it

142
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,900
Select it right now. Oh

143
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:54,300
Let's go. I'm going back to Wild Goose

144
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:06,949
It's good for me

145
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:10,599
What is port town to

146
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:16,159
Hey, I might get lucky because if these tracks are really really hard then people might just explode

147
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:29,050
All right. Here's I'm gonna just do old lady driving. I feel like it's gonna be helpful. This is not Grand Prix

148
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,940
This didn't set up. I just had a countdown on it. Didn't oh

149
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,960
I thought this is the one they leave

150
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,519
Oh

151
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,429
Well, why did this one have a countdown I can do it after

152
00:35:53,719 --> 00:36:02,670
Sneak by that one

153
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:59,989
Whoa, whoa, should I touch those? Oh, they're sucking us to them. I get it. I thought I was supposed to touch those

154
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:13,510
It's getting hard now. All right, just don't die. I almost have one. Come on

155
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:29,090
Give me this. Oh now I know why this is a pro track because we still have to be on

156
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:37,510
I should have drove like an old lady. My god. I've no experience with these things. It's scary

157
00:37:38,110 --> 00:38:10,280
Can they see my health? I hope not. This is a big deal if I can hit this

158
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:54,230
Great about 50. I did it. So do I get to stay in the race?

159
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:56,869
Got a lot of tickets

160
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:00,929
brand-free

161
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:03,380
night league

162
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,920
Test your metal in the ultimate five race series

163
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
all right, I'm gonna do this and

164
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,199
We are going to this be it I'm gonna call it after this

165
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:38,630
Stay on goose. The bet is for the first race. Will he reach top 50 in the next race?

166
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:49,000
That's what you're betting on. All right, let's do it. These are difficult. No, it's okay if I lose I'm sorry off 80 advance

167
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,559
That's all I'm I'm gonna drive like an old. I don't care about winning. I just need to get to number 79. That's it

168
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:02,619
That's all I care about watch this. What's all these watch all these weirdos watch this. They used to get all drive

169
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,099
How would you do that need to get to 80th place? Oh

170
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,010
You guys bet that's right

171
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,489
My bad my bad. I could I'll try I'll try

172
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,210
That's right. Sorry

173
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:32,309
Hey, don't be stupid I can get up to 50 in one second at the very end here. Oh, I have to get up now

174
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,320
Good I made it I made it I made it. I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh

175
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
My god, that was terrifying but we're good

176
00:41:48,400 --> 00:42:15,340
Yeah, almost I tried I really did not bad though I

177
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:26,880
ranked up

178
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,199
Okay. So now there are 80

179
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:39,019
Honestly, my strategy is just to stay in the very back

180
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:41,699
Whatever the maximum number is

181
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:50,679
Try to get to this very very slowly try to get to top 20 top 40. I have nobody pay attention to me

182
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,619
So this is top 60 fast

183
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,860
I'll try to get to 50 at the very end

184
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,739
I'm gonna try to get as high a place as I can

185
00:43:14,059 --> 00:44:57,789
Okay, now we do it now. I'm gonna hang out in this thing here good place to do it. Fuck out of my way

186
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:08,219
Come on, give me those coins

187
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:19,349
Yeah

188
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:26,070
31 I'm in the bees now

189
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:41,980
Top 50 now top 40 good race

190
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:51,289
See, this is where it gets weird because I've gotten top 50 a few times but top 40 top 20

191
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:59,820
This really might be actual grandma mode for real this time

192
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:15,860
I'm gonna try to conserve boost as much as I possibly can

193
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:28,909
Whoa, that was weird. Where are we going? Oh, we're crossing over each other

194
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:58,519
Easy hold this for now, you know

195
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:17,780
I'll stay in 10th place. I don't care. I got a kale

196
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,230
Grandma, you got to drive better than this

197
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:51,610
All right. Here we go

198
00:47:51,610 --> 00:48:24,170
I'm not doing anything stupid. I had to use it because I want to stay up here with everybody. All right, just drive

199
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:31,590
I'm still safe. Just gotta get to top 40

200
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:49,099
Oh!

201
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,099
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

202
00:48:52,719 --> 00:49:05,489
Top 30 that was my nephew you KO'd

203
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:16,099
You threw so bad. No, I got full boost just started spamming egg

204
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:21,280
30

205
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:40,010
This is okay. Cool. I'm doing all right. I got B pluses as my rivals now. This one has wind. Top 20 advance

206
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,800
You know what?

207
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:14,300
That's fine. I don't got to be in first place. I just have to get into 30th place. My camera's tilted

208
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:36,699
I don't like it

209
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:49,989
Stay up here. I gotta stay up in 30

210
00:50:53,309 --> 00:51:03,480
Am I safe? All of you fucking clowns get out of the way

211
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:12,969
It's happening, but I hope I'm doing okay

212
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:26,539
All right, just heal heal heal. I'm fine. I'm just gonna bump the fuck out of this thing. Yes

213
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,360
I need coins

214
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,800
Dude, I need coins

215
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,159
Give me that coin

216
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:52,289
Fuck oh shit. Oh, I

217
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:17,230
Had it too. That was really fun. Oh fuck. Oh shit. It got bumped too many times. I would have made it too

218
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,639
Too bad

219
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:34,780
All right, let me do one more race one more. I don't want to watch this like fall guys

220
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:51,059
I don't want to watch the people jump on the cubes for like fucking 40 minutes. Do I have to sit here?

221
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,940
This is the final though. Oh, that's true

222
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:00,539
Spectate. Spectate leader. Let's see. Let's see how well you do

223
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:32,000
Seriously, what is the secret here? Show it to me. Not bad. Ah, there's a shortcut. Is that a shortcut?

224
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,199
I don't know. Who's number one? All right, this is

225
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,440
Bronze is in a first place again

226
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:58,039
Still in first place. So you take a left you gotta hit that jump

227
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,869
Risky, but saves a lot of time

228
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,960
I'm asleep behind. Yeah. All right. Ooh

229
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,239
Almost just hit the red

230
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,670
Good recovery good recovery. Oh

231
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:24,900
Still top four

232
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:44,739
Use your attack more does the attack use boost? I've been afraid to use it. It does not. Okay, just a cool-down

233
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:47,570
It's really actually awesome. Oh

234
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:58,010
And bronze pull it through not going for the risky play going for the continuous just stay in fourth place. Oh

235
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:12,079
And that's it it's a good idea stay in fourth, all right

236
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:33,139
Let me do one more because I actually really do like this. GG. Nice job. So they actually

237
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,039
Wow, it's only

238
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,559
two hours

239
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:46,579
Those are special cool special event team battle. How are your team to victory? I don't want to drag somebody down

240
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:56,269
Alright one last bet for the night

241
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:02,650
Don't really care where we go, but why not?

242
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,789
What is a top 50 I

243
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:38,000
Think it's doable now. Oh bronze is right in front of us. I was gonna stay right next to bronze the whole entire game

244
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't even know where he is

245
00:56:40,840 --> 00:57:30,630
That was pretty good. We've just freaked me out and I'm the one that hurt him

246
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:33,800
He bounced off the wall and hit me and it freaked me out

247
00:57:34,440 --> 00:58:47,519
way worse

248
00:58:50,159 --> 00:59:11,719
That one doesn't count I'm really I'm like exclaiming really a lot today

249
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:22,150
Feel like I'm watching a boxing match like whoa, don't dodge it. Whoa

250
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:47,760
Popcorns going everywhere. All right. This is the real last one. I was almost in the 25 to final last one

251
00:59:48,280 --> 01:00:00,329
You're at three to one odds. You got to take the dark side. You got to try to make that uh, make those channel points

252
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:08,119
That's funny. I like that

253
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,840
Yeah, let's check this out

254
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,239
I've been I've been just

255
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:25,289
Been faking it the whole time watch this. I'm gonna get top 20. I'm gonna be a nail-biter. I

256
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:51,360
Just grabbed the wall and ran my head into it over and over again

257
01:00:51,960 --> 01:01:19,119
Wait a shit

258
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,719
Give me a minute

259
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:50,670
Sir, I'm in a good position right now. I actually am that's how we that's called

260
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:52,590
Good

261
01:01:52,590 --> 01:02:35,489
See you later suckers. So long suckers

262
01:02:36,170 --> 01:03:01,860
I did it. I got it. All right that unlocked one more

263
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:05,219
actual final for real the last one

264
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:08,920
I'm just happy

265
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,869
Tried to be the team one

266
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:14,550
All right, we'll do team battle and that'll be the last one

267
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:20,239
Race aggressively with your team and fight for victory highest team score wins

268
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,909
any ko's

269
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:46,559
Go fast. I don't know which one I prefer probably this one

270
01:03:46,599 --> 01:04:03,159
Okay, pink team versus a green team earn points and lead pink to victory, okay

271
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:32,119
Pink team takes the lead. It's a good amount of points so far

272
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:55,030
Losing surrounded by greens

273
01:04:55,750 --> 01:05:14,599
Okay

274
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:32,469
Come on pink. All right, I'm gonna farm this

275
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:43,519
Okay, I'm not gonna touch it once this is what I meant to say. Oh

276
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,719
That was a good good hits good hits

277
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,909
we win

278
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:34,429
pink wins

279
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:41,989
Yes, we did

280
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:56,190
Surely one more. Yeah, it might as well just go out with one final one. I got it. Did I get a new thing?

281
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:59,449
Wait, how do I?

282
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:03,150
Might do that

283
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:11,400
No, that's not what I wanted. Okay. Well, um, I tried to go to workshop and it bounced around and

284
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:17,769
Let's go

285
01:07:17,769 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay

286
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:37,409
Just a mini Grand Prix. We're okay. You don't have to end the stream. No, we're cool. I'm cool

287
01:07:37,769 --> 01:08:00,519
I planned on stopping around like 730, but no, we're good. I'm good. Just chillin in the background right now

288
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:02,440
there's just like the

289
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,679
trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange

290
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:31,329
You guys are all just screaming at each other about buying and selling. I gotta get to at least top. Back in the green

291
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,810
full charge almost

292
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,479
here we

293
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,810
here we

294
01:08:39,810 --> 01:09:15,000
here we go

295
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:27,770
Perfect actually perfect

296
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:31,840
perfect

297
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:50,750
Perfect. Okay go. I did it top 25. Nice

298
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,329
Now I gotta go from top 25 to top 10

299
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:12,899
these are

300
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:23,039
Just done very quickly, too. I like that a lot. So does that put me in a better place?

301
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:36,279
I imagine it probably does is this top? It's top 60. That's it. Very addictive. It is I love it though. This is great

302
01:10:36,800 --> 01:11:27,420
Yeah, okay somebody's dead that always sucks I have to do it now

303
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:18,560
Final lap coming up. I just need my super boost for the final lap and I'm good. Got it some health

304
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,130
I have a lot of time left. Let's do it

305
01:12:22,729 --> 01:13:25,689
It's

306
01:13:26,289 --> 01:13:36,439
All right, this is the last one

307
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:54,829
I've never seen the end probably top 50 for the last one. Where does that put me overall?

308
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
24th overall

309
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,829
that accurate

310
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:12,220
This upcoming level sucks. Prepare yourself. Oh, this does look really really hard

311
01:14:12,819 --> 01:14:23,670
that you tell me I have to go through a fucking queue from

312
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,800
Roller roller coaster tycoon that could have been a much cleaner joke

313
01:14:30,319 --> 01:15:13,649
You know what I was saying, you got to go over the jumps it's really important not that not bad actually

314
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:33,390
Could have been way worse

315
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:42,000
I didn't mean to do that, but it's okay. It's a really bad place to use this but at least get across this part. Oh

316
01:16:02,779 --> 01:16:06,680
Just me and you Matt

317
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:39,149
Me and Matt hanging out in the very bottom. I'm dead. This is this is ridiculously hard

318
01:16:39,670 --> 01:17:10,350
That was fun. That was fun. Machines

319
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:15,569
fire stingray

320
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:20,960
decals boost

321
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,140
Level five. What does that do?

322
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:26,449
There's a different boost

323
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:38,149
Yeah, we have to see what it looks like

324
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:45,319
grandpa playing knockoff Mario Kart

325
01:17:45,920 --> 01:18:11,439
I'm surprised how much I really like this. Where's my

326
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:27,069
That wasn't me. They're adding some more maps at the end of September just melt pac-man 99 was like this too, though

327
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:32,560
I got really really addicted to that for like a whole night a couple nights

328
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:36,539
Played it. You could did it off stream, too

329
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:46,789
That's what I did for like three days straight off screen

330
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:55,279
And I got so mad at one point that I went

331
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:00,800
Fucker and I put both my legs up and put both my heels down. I went through the ground

332
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,119
although at the same time I

333
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:26,979
Would use it, but I'm not going to

334
01:19:41,340 --> 01:20:03,439
Perfect placement. That was pretty good

335
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:32,659
Hey

336
01:20:32,659 --> 01:20:35,840
Collect these so I can do it at the very end

337
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:45,920
I'm gonna be good at this might be actually really great

338
01:20:46,560 --> 01:21:07,359
Let me get top 15. Let me get top 15 right here

339
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:20,270
Yes, everybody avoid me top 15, let's go

340
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:46,470
Getting better. I'm psyching myself up big time tonight. Somebody's behind me. That's the spirit. Yeah

341
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:55,229
All right. Well, I can't go until you lose. I think that's the good philosophy here because I did I just did 22

342
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:57,750
Now I just did 13

343
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:05,130
If I go if I place under 13, then I'm gonna get out here and get there. It's dinner time

344
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:27,909
Let me take out one headphone because I'm like speech jamming myself here. There we go. Are you listening to yourself?

345
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:35,840
No, it's just sometimes when music and noises in both ears. I can't hear myself talk. Sometimes I go. Where am I?

346
01:22:36,520 --> 01:23:17,729
Cannot hear anything. All right, I gotta get at least in the top 12. All right, I'm getting a little too cocky here

347
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:46,779
Oh, I didn't get the kill for that

348
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:55,050
Time to I go drive like grandma until next round

349
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:17,079
Shit. Oh

350
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:25,949
Well, this was a bad one speaking of the one to lose

351
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:45,380
Nobody touch me. Nobody touch me. Don't touch me. Nobody touch me. I finished it

352
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,300
All right. I'll see you guys later

353
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:58,170
Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out

354
01:24:58,489 --> 01:24:59,770
probably

355
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:02,390
Looking at the calendar

356
01:25:03,069 --> 01:25:08,630
I'm gonna be seeing some family. I will not be around. I also have some work stuff to do

357
01:25:09,149 --> 01:25:11,149
So the next time you see me

358
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:19,500
Will be probably at the I want to say Tuesday of next week gonna be visiting family

359
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:29,449
And then we'll probably we'll probably end up doing a couple streams

360
01:25:30,289 --> 01:25:32,289
next week

361
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:36,420
Probably Tuesday and Sunday. I want to get a couple in next week

362
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:44,260
Because there's a there's a couple things. I really want to do. I want to play armored core. I

363
01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:47,020
Really want to do

364
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:54,340
Yes, it is my birthday this week as well. And hey this thing family for my birthday. So that should be that should be nice

365
01:25:54,979 --> 01:26:00,279
Yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday and then we'll do armored core probably

366
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:05,649
We'll figure what we're gonna do on Sunday. Maybe browser games

367
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:09,569
Let's get back to the goofy browser games on Sunday of next week

368
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:19,060
Been a while my 38th birthday. Yes, it is

369
01:26:19,659 --> 01:26:33,260
Getting there another few years another couple of years and I'm gonna be I don't know. It's gonna be weird

370
01:26:33,899 --> 01:26:39,130
Two more years till the judgment day at 40

371
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:48,460
Did you queue again? No the the computer took over you

372
01:26:48,819 --> 01:26:53,260
Leave the controller on the table for a few minutes of the CPU takes over kind of like left dead

373
01:26:53,380 --> 01:27:10,449
I wonder how they do food mode fog

374
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,039
Yeah, I'll see you next week

375
01:27:16,039 --> 01:27:33,140
Ending on 69 was not good enough for you

376
01:27:33,819 --> 01:27:40,689
It was it was good enough, but I kind of had to do it differently

377
01:27:41,329 --> 01:28:53,159
Don't booze not right now. I'm in 30th. I'm fine. Okay final lap drive good

378
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:57,140
Take it easy. I didn't get credit for that. I didn't hit shit

379
01:28:57,659 --> 01:28:59,659
Oops wrong button, but I'm okay. Oh

380
01:29:01,819 --> 01:29:07,539
That's bad. Oh, that's very very very bad. I got I just got destroyed

381
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:18,539
Lucky bumper, what am I doing?

382
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:36,579
I get to be I want to play one more. I

383
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:45,630
Want to play one more and I'm going to because it's my birthday

384
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:50,319
And I'm also almost 40 so I get to dictate when I stop screaming

385
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:53,279
And when I want to go to bed, and I'm not ready for bed yet. I

386
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,630
Want to keep playing

387
01:29:57,630 --> 01:30:16,510
Understand I'm gonna go a new strategy on this one, and then this is actually the final one for real

388
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:26,619
There's no joking around right now. Actually. I'm gonna leave after this. It's a fun stream though finally be breath of the wild

389
01:30:27,859 --> 01:30:33,100
Did the punch-out thing like this did goldenite gold my controls were awful

390
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:36,670
If I play that again, I definitely want to switch it up for the other ones

391
01:30:37,149 --> 01:30:55,600
Still fun to do facility again though if I just hit L&R and inside of all that big group

392
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,680
I kind of just mess everything up don't I yeah?

393
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:17,909
I'm fine sitting right in the middle for now

394
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:22,430
But let's go ahead and use this right

395
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:43,659
Avoid all the bullshit

396
01:31:44,380 --> 01:32:04,739
Okay, that's good. That's good. All right now. I just want to get leveled up

397
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:32,770
Yeah, there we go all right last lap I got a lot of boost don't waste it. Oh, I forgot that was the last lap

398
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:39,439
I got top 50 so I don't know why I was thought that was one more

399
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:51,420
Okay, all right see you later. I said it out loud. Yeah, but

400
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:56,899
It's different processing versus saying something that one didn't even count you're right

401
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:21,609
He's never gonna end I'm ending after this

402
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:35,500
But you guys put me on this game, and I can't get away from it

403
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:46,680
Did the other one still exists like the Mario one the pac-man one Tetris?

404
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,289
Because I could seriously play

405
01:33:50,329 --> 01:33:53,130
These for an entire stream just all night

406
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:56,579
They don't exist anymore

407
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:18,340
Better start don't talk all right no talking this whole match, and I'll get the top line here. We go

408
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:36,699
Pump me out of that. Oh my god. What a disaster

409
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:29,329
Okay, here we go final lap and I have pretty much full boost probably get it again

410
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:59,260
Stop 25. We got it. Bye. Good night top 25. That's how you go out

411
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:03,899
You come in not first place not second place not third place not even 10th place

412
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:12,500
You go so far down, but they don't give medals anymore, and they haven't in a very long time

413
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:25,500
Let's go

414
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:43,619
Okay

415
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:50,760
What if I did this one of the goofy boys or something you guys would like that right

416
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:59,770
I turn it on

417
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:04,699
Hello, I go up to our sometimes. It doesn't work

418
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:28,920
You act like you're not gonna sit and play this off stream. Anyways. Do you get it?

419
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,060
You know exactly what's gonna happen

420
01:37:31,060 --> 01:37:37,420
It's gonna happen is I'm gonna take this in the bathroom and drop the biggest dump of my entire life

421
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,899
Well, I beat everybody in this game

422
01:37:40,739 --> 01:38:18,090
How many people in this lobby right now are sitting on the toilet? It's 99 people here. I'll be like 60 people

423
01:38:18,529 --> 01:39:07,680
I gotta be aggressive. No, I care way too much about that thing. Yeah

424
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:16,789
Well, I I wanted to end it. Anyways, did I just am I safe?

425
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:38,899
That's fun. I will see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Always Pac-man is going away in October

426
01:39:38,899 --> 01:39:49,510
Oh, that's sad. Yeah. Have a good night. See you guys next week. We'll stream twice next week

427
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:56,340
I think I could get a couple in there. Maybe I'll play the Pac-man one again

428
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:03,100
I feel like I really like that check. Can I just I think I'm just gonna do that on Tuesday. That sounds fun

429
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:14,949
Maybe I'll play this again on Tuesday play Pac-man 99 on Tuesday. Maybe some armored core. Maybe some sorcery. I'll see

430
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,819
Yeah, Pac-man is gone on October. Yeah

431
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:31,659
Okay. Well, that was fun. Hope you had a good time everybody. We'll see you in a little bit longer

432
01:40:31,899 --> 01:40:35,250

434
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:17,770
