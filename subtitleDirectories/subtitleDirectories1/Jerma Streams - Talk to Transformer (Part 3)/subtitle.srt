1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:33,560
All right, so let's see. I got fucking wiped out. Do Family Feud? All right, that sounds like fun.

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:59,899
The one for the Xbox? Please no. What? Well, maybe we'll save that for Connect.

3
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:14,659
Play something new? I did that today. Do more Ancestors? I don't think I'll ever play that game

4
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:43,109
again. If I'm completely honest. What should we do? Let's see. What are my final thoughts?

5
00:01:43,109 --> 00:02:04,060
Final thoughts on Ancestors? It was, okay, there's a lot going on in the game. They kind of dark

6
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,400
souls you and you're supposed to figure it out, but at the same time they tell you a bunch of

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:17,479
stuff to do. And then on top of that, it's kind of hard to even play it in the first place.

8
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:26,090
That it's a cool idea, but execution wise, I mean, it was just kind of all over the place.

9
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:44,090
Talk to Transformer? Yeah, you know, let's do that. Let's just talk to Transformer for like an hour or

10
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:55,030
two. Not that long. Maybe if they patch it, they may, I don't know. It just, for every interesting

11
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,750
idea that game had, there was something that was equally just stupid. That I just, I was like,

12
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:14,020
what the hell? Why is this even here? That's my real opinion. All right, let's, let's do some,

13
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,129
let's do some fucking voice work. What do you say? For every good idea, there was a tiger. Yeah,

14
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:23,849
but even if I was supposed to stay up in the trees, a ton of that game is down on the ground.

15
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:30,969
You know, you're going to drink water. You can't get water from a tree. I've got to go pick up

16
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:43,240
fucking sticks and stones. I didn't even know about the whole like evolve through the times.

17
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,939
I thought that the, I don't even need, we don't even need to talk about it. It was a very fun

18
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:58,819
idea. Very cool stuff. I just, I just don't think you'll see me playing that game again.

19
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:06,759
Interesting concept though. Interesting concept. Okay. So I'm going to get this on. Let me turn,

20
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:24,649
let me, am I like fucking ugly for a webcam? Let's see. Let's see. Let's see how fucking weird I

21
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:43,290
look. What's wrong with the camera? Well, it'd be nice if it was plugged in. Why is this not

22
00:04:43,290 --> 00:05:00,860
plugged in? That makes no fucking sense. 800,000 years of evolution. All right, let's take a look.

23
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:24,220
This is bright as fucking hell. Jesus. All right, I'm going to put on Talk to Transformer and talk

24
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:47,449
to it because that's what you do. Hello. Oh, wait a minute. You got, I got to turn off the

25
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:59,740
desync here. All right. Carve out the responses that I will. I'm just going to do this for like

26
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:17,370
an hour. Do tier lists? Um, I feel like that'll take a while. I think I only really want to

27
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,189
stream for like another 30, 40 minutes, but I didn't want to just end right there. Did I kill

28
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:30,329
anything yet? No, I didn't kill one thing in the game. Oh no, actually that's not true. All of my

29
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:45,339
monkeys died. So I technically did kill them. I guess in a technical sense. Okay. 18 of them

30
00:06:45,339 --> 00:07:05,100
to be exact. Yeah. All right. I think I've gotten over it. Let's open it up. Here we go.

31
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:27,500
I'm going to cover up the responses. Well, not all that. To make it so you can't see.

32
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,819
So in case something fucking bad comes through, we can just get rid of it.

33
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:51,980
Like that. So for instance, let's just curious to see what I make sure nobody can see what's

34
00:07:51,980 --> 00:08:13,990
going on down here. It's taking a while. Okay. So you can't see it. Only I can. So that's just

35
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:30,889
made that up. Let's go with, oh, I gotta change the name of the game too. I can see everything.

36
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:46,970
No, you can't. Chilling with transformer. Put it into IRL because that's what we're just doing.

37
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:52,389
Hanging out. There we go. Not playing that game anymore. Let's go. I've said, let's go like five

38
00:08:52,389 --> 00:09:27,110
times. All right. How about this? Okay. This is, this one is just kind of, just kind of good for

39
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:34,470
you to know. Balloons tower defense is what you should play. However, if you do decide to do play

40
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,590
tower defense, you will want to focus your energy on a few things. Leveling. The following guide

41
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,789
will show you what you should be doing at the start of your level. Make sure to take into

42
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:46,549
account when using the first upgrade that you should be spending some of those extra points

43
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:52,779
on if you'd like to spam kill. Keep this guide as a guide, not to tell you how to level up

44
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:02,600
your character, but more to give you some pointers. Level 10. Level 19. Level 27. Level 34.

45
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:13,210
Level 39. Level 44. Level 47. Not very many tips on how to play. Once the required level,

46
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,970
once there's the required level and you've got the level up, you've really the time to get to grips

47
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,730
with the rest of the game to spend some time with the gameplay mechanics before we get into actual

48
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,250
gameplay. There are some things you'll want to do early on as a beginner while the basic abilities

49
00:10:28,250 --> 00:11:03,190
aren't particularly fun. That's it. Those are pretty solid balloons tower defense tips. Okay,

50
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:30,139
I need some music too. Get some tunes on. Okay, let's try this one. What's this website called?

51
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:37,590
This is TalkToTransformer.com. You punch in a sentence or a word and it'll make a full

52
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:44,539
fucked up randomized AI story for you. This is going to be really loud so let me turn it down.

53
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,570
Okay, so let's get the music going. I'm going to get off cam for this because

54
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:12,340
people are reading in here. Please be quiet. I'm serious. As they were thinking, the people who

55
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,009
were supposed to be reading in the room at that time fell silent. The people who seemed to have

56
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,690
been in there for some time, the children, the staff, and the people of the academy,

57
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,169
all of them felt as if they were in a kind of trance just like they had when they were sleeping,

58
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:37,529
not knowing what to do. What did I do? Why were they all asleep like that? I guess I must have

59
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:44,009
been quite noisy the entire time. I just have to make it a calm, serene atmosphere so that the

60
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:50,169
people inside can do their business safely. The place I was thinking of was the study room

61
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:55,049
where the disciples of this academy lived, but how many children could I hold in my arms?

62
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,210
Even if I tried to, I couldn't bring more than one at a time. When I thought about it, I realized

63
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:07,899
that with a total of four, I could not have more than four people. With a troubled expression,

64
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:25,909
I approached the people inside. More than an ape-children armor. Oh my god. And then what?

65
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:39,259
Who knows? Let's see. There you go. With a troubled expression, I approached the people inside the...

66
00:13:48,409 --> 00:14:09,370
Hold on. Okay. I'm going to try this one. With a troubled expression, I approached the people

67
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:19,000
inside the carriage and told them to put the clothes off. Are you tired? Yes. While I spoke,

68
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,080
Anne, who was standing in the back, started to dress herself. She was holding her arms

69
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,000
with an embarrassed expression. Anyways, it's fine. You just ignore this and go back.

70
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,200
Why are you treating me like this? Don't you agree? I'll be going, so you just have to ignore it for

71
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,820
now. I thought of a good plan that made use of Anne's good mood and headed to the next carriage.

72
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,549
I told Anika to stay where I am, and she returned. I'll be going back immediately,

73
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:50,759
and then I'll be leaving once again. By the way, Sirius Kun. Can we let that cat in the carriage

74
00:14:50,759 --> 00:15:11,059
since he has a strange appearance? Sirius Kun. I don't... I don't have... I have nothing to say

75
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:21,700
about that one. Let me move this a little because it's kind of screwed up. There we go.

76
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,440
Okay, by the way, Sirius... We'll do this one too. By the way, Sirius Kun, can we let that cat in the

77
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:44,700
carriage since he has a strange appearance? He is... Keep going. Let us play balloons. By the way,

78
00:15:44,700 --> 00:16:08,549
Sirius Kun, can we let that cat in the carriage since he has a strange appearance? He is also

79
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:15,779
not a human. I also need to look into the cat. Yeah, let's have him. It's okay because it is

80
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,500
dangerous, so I don't want to worry you. I looked at the surroundings and looked at Sirius Kun.

81
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,779
I had a feeling that it would become a problem since the cat is going to get eaten if Sirius

82
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,149
Kun and that cat continue to fight against each other, but I don't have an idea in regards to a

83
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:38,340
strategy yet. It might be better to show a different side of Sirius Kun and leave it be. Well,

84
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,059
I wanted to make him feel the fear of this cat. I wonder if maybe he can feel a little bit of fear

85
00:16:43,059 --> 00:17:23,990
at that moment. After all, I am the one that is the prey here. Well, I'll see you soon, Sirius Kun.

86
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:49,220
Leave it. This is just... I don't... Okay, this is... Garfield versus German NA5 in a steel cage,

87
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,180
the main event of the night pitted the two best female wrestlers and the winner of this one would

88
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,170
go on to win the WWE Women's Championship at SummerSlam. The show wasn't great, but I'm sure

89
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:06,420
the real reason Fox decided to stage it in a gym was just to look good. Hope you guys enjoy this.

90
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:13,900
Feel free to leave comments on the video and let us know what you think of it in the forum. Fox.

91
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,440
Okay, this one's gonna be funny.

92
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,730
I was on the forums last night and I heard about that WWE main event,

93
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:30,759
so I had to watch it on loop last night so I could post up a list of the names that were

94
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,490
called up or put up. So who's the best of the lot? In no particular order. Here's a breakdown.

95
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:43,210
CM Punk won the Raw main event with a steel chair hammer pile driver finish over Batista

96
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:49,140
in one hour and seven minutes. He followed that up with a drop kick on Batista off the top rope,

97
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,220
dropping the champion to the mat again. Batista came back for three and that's where things got

98
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,789
weird. I'm still waiting to hear from WWE and if I have a response I'll give it to you.

99
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:05,190
For now if you're upset that Batista got that far, take a deep breath and take another walk

100
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:13,940
down the hallway. Tom Brady versus Clayton Custer versus CM Punk versus Barry Smith.

101
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,430
That was a pretty fun match, but what really stood out was the action on the outside.

102
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:26,779
Tom Brady

103
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:41,079
who is Barry Smith. I watched it on loop last night to be able to write it down.

104
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:18,630
Okay, let's get, ladies and gentlemen, here we go. Tom Brady versus Clayton Custer versus CM Punk

105
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:25,990
versus Barry Smith tonight at 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time,

Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, at 8 o'clock Eastern time.

109
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,529
Put your TiVo on for 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 o'clock Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time,

110
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:50,809
8 o'clock Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern time, 8 a.m. Eastern

113
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:46,680
Brand Bay Brewing's Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial IPA. Brand Bay Brewing's Double IPA. Let's try that one. Brand Bay Brewing's Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial IPA.

114
00:23:46,680 --> 00:24:42,900
This one's like, I don't know. Hold on. Is this a real place? Okay, here we go. Brand Bay Brewing's Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial IPA.

115
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:52,140
Brand Bay Brewing's Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial IPA, pictured above, is a dry-hopped imperial IPA that's a massive addition to the brewery's lineup.

116
00:24:52,140 --> 00:25:00,569
And it is now available at liquor stores around Austin. We visited the distillery early in June and drank it in all its pungent golden glory.

117
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:14,420
We caught up with Brand Bay CEO Sean Colony via email to talk about this beer, what was going on at the distillery, and how it fits in as a major addition to the brewery's lineup.

118
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:21,420
We've had a few beers from the brewery previously, but this one was by far my favorite. What was the process of coming up with such a flavorful and unique beer?

119
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:28,589
In order to create the bourbon barrel-aged imperial IPA, we had to create a beer that was as unique and special as the barrel.

120
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:38,589
It was so hard to find a beer that had that dry-hopped nature to it. Our original plan was to pair our bourbon with a special citrus hop called Cascade or Magnum.

121
00:25:38,589 --> 00:26:20,190
Interesting, that's it. This is...I'm just gonna do it.

122
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:34,470
Having some trouble in the realms? You guys make up a large portion of the server population and we want to help you improve your gaming experience as well.

123
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,470
Here's an in-depth guide on how to fix a few minor problems.

124
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:47,160
The following list is just a very small list, with the caveat that the fixes listed herein aren't for every problem, but are all effective as a temporary fix for most people.

125
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,160
It's very important that you verify that your desired improvement can be achieved by simply adding a character or two to that server for a couple of minutes.

126
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,160
And in particular, that this does not cause a lag spike, freezes, or other performance issues.

127
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:07,849
If you're having issues with any of these, don't hesitate to leave a message. It'll help us to do our best to fix it.

128
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:10,279
Multiplayer errors.

129
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:28,369
If a character that you had set to offline is back online but after a brief time has passed, such as while another person is playing or logging out and back, you find that the other person has joined your game.

130
00:27:28,369 --> 00:28:14,019
And then, nothing. Let's try. That image, hold on.

131
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:23,240
What the fuck? Wait, this is...this doesn't make any fucking sense.

132
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:39,250
Filling my mouth with way too much peanut butter. Filling my mouth with way too much peanut butter, I decided to do something crazy.

133
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,869
To my surprise, I managed to stop and write a paragraph.

134
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:54,759
I'd have a very bad day. If you want to stop and write a paragraph, you could use the pen and paper version on this exercise by clicking here.

135
00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:04,259
Note that the pen and paper version is very basic, so if you want to be completely in control, you should use a pen and paper renewable device.

136
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:11,849
We'll start by writing a list of numbers on a piece of paper until we reach our goal.

137
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:21,420
After completing the list of numbers on paper, I made a commitment to do another paragraph.

138
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,420
The only way to get a straight answer in mathematics, I decided, was to write a paragraph and stop at that point.

139
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,420
It's not a new concept, but a math teacher, Mark Jacobson, explains that it's essential to know if you're on track.

140
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:39,049
I can't do it this time, though. I have to stop when I reach four, because it's infinity.

141
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:52,390
If I was doing the exercise now, I would feel a little peanut butter in my mouth.

142
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:37,170
Let them tell you a story. I like that phrase. Let them tell you a really horrible story, not me. Let them tell you.

143
00:30:38,170 --> 00:31:26,319
What? This is fucking ridiculous.

144
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:50,740
So I'm going to go through this one slowly. Just just. OK.

145
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:56,369
I'm just going to read it. I'm only 16 and I was the last in my family to get married.

146
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:04,369
So imagine that. Imagine me. Imagine you get married to a man that just killed his whole family and the rest of your family gets on their knees begging you to take their daughter.

147
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:09,369
Why not? He'll ask you. Well, there's only one solution. Why not? Oh, they're all dead now. That's all I got.

148
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:22,609
I just went into the water and I drowned. It was the worst day of my life. What the fuck is this?

149
00:32:22,609 --> 00:33:22,099
Now, tell me a good tell me a fun story. This is not even this is just stupid.

150
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:30,099
It's about mocha butter. Yeah, delicious. Oh, yeah. I love mocha butter. Mocha butter is delicious. That's it.

151
00:33:30,099 --> 00:34:26,239
OK, here we go. Tell me a story, Grandpa. Who were you? I'm a student.

152
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,239
Well, I saw somebody get down on that leg and say, I'm a student. That's my son. That's my grandson.

153
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,610
And he just went, Oh, yeah. Who else would want that? He's right. He's a student. He's my son.

154
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:42,610
And then you get back to these kids and you're like, Oh, that's really nice to hear that he cares.

155
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:50,849
And you don't actually care. But it's like you see that you have some influence whether you realize this or not on the kids you spent a lot of time with.

156
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:57,019
And there's this whole thing where you actually care and you actually helped him out and try to help him be a good parent.

157
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:03,840
I remember this from my own kid. She was a good kid. And she has sweet little face and a little cute laugh.

158
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:10,510
Every time I spoke with her, she would smile and say hi. And I would get up and walk around her in a circle.

159
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:19,769
Okay, Grandpa. Time for bed, right? It's like 630 p.m.

160
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:22,460
That's right. Good night.

161
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:30,809
Grandpa is sleepwalking again because I'm sleeping in the same spot every single night.

162
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:38,480
I wonder if I'll get all and die. I got the feeling that he actually isn't the only one with that mentality.

163
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,480
The last time I checked the entire Mountain Dew is my favorite campaign was started by some kids in South Korea.

164
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,849
I wonder if he'd be all right with being dead. I wonder if people who think like this ever find ways to make ends meet.

165
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:56,849
Thanks to Nana-sama for the link. Reply or report the post.

166
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:07,409
I got the feeling he actually isn't the only one with that mentality.

167
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:13,409
The last time I checked the entire Mountain Dew is my favorite campaign was started by some kids in South Korea.

168
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:32,710
I wonder if he'd be all right with being dead.

169
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,360
I wonder if he'd be all right with being dead. Is that like an old man and then somebody talking about the old man?

170
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:50,820
Oh, God.

171
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:02,730
I can't. I can't. I can't do this one. I'm gonna, but just bear with me.

172
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:14,780
Mountain Dew is my favorite. I do have a small amount of dessert, half teaspoon in the fridge, but it is not as nice and soft.

173
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
It makes about 15 teaspoons of powder.

174
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:25,780
Five grams powdered cinnamon, one medium cinnamon stick, one vanilla bean, one teaspoon ground cinnamon, one half teaspoon ground cloves,

175
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:32,780
one teaspoon ground ginger, one fourth teaspoon ground nutmeg, half teaspoon ground cloves, the dry ingredients this time now,

176
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,780
one cinnamon stick, one teaspoon ground cinnamon, half teaspoon ground cloves, one teaspoon ground ginger,

177
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,780
one fourth teaspoon ground nutmeg, half teaspoon ground cloves, that's all you need.

178
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,780
And the liquids now, one banana, two cups water, I recommend a double boiler.

179
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Sorry, I have something in my throat.

180
00:38:49,780 --> 00:39:01,820
Two cups brown sugar, half teaspoon ground cloves, half teaspoon ground ginger,

181
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,820
one fourth teaspoon ground nutmeg, half teaspoon ground cloves, two egg whites, one cup of sugar.

182
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:18,829
My favorite is one egg white plus half teaspoon of salt.

183
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:21,829
Now for the sugar based ingredients, of course.

184
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:28,829
One cup white sugar, one third cup water, three tablespoons sugar, one tablespoon molasses, one tablespoon ground cinnamon,

185
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,829
two teaspoons ground ginger, half teaspoons of something else.

186
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:39,530
I have listed on the liquids of banana.

187
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:47,139
One banana and five cups of sandwich.

188
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:06,099
No one would eat that.

189
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,730
Make it? Alright, I'm going to make this.

190
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,309
I'm copying this.

191
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:25,210
Oh my god, the fucking five cups of powdered cinnamon.

192
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:41,980
Only makes 15 teaspoons.

193
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
Yeah, what, do you bake it? Do you cook it down?

194
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,070
Okay, here we go.

195
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,070
Oh no, here we go again.

196
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,500
The secret recipe for my famous pancakes, which make a spectacular addition to any sandwich,

197
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
and one of my favorite quick and easy breakfast items, in addition to the chicken.

198
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,500
The other ingredients are two to one eggs, two to one, two tablespoons of butter,

199
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.

200
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,940
You would not put balsamic vinegar in pancakes.

201
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,940
Alright, I'm going to try this again.

202
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,849
The secret recipe for my favorite pancakes, which make a spectacular addition to sandwiches,

203
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:43,849
and one of my favorite quick and easy breakfast items, in addition to the chicken.

204
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:49,849
The other ingredients are two to one eggs, two to half tablespoons of butter,

205
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:55,849
two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, two teaspoons of white wine, one tablespoon of gravy.

206
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:22,239
Okay, I need some other music. That music is making me laugh. That's better.

207
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,739
Welcome back. How are you? Good to see you again.

208
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:28,039
Welcome back to Anthony's Kitchen.

209
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,039
Today we've got a very special show for you,

210
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,039
because I'm going to tell you something my mother passed down to me.

211
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:40,039
It's the secret recipe that my family has for pancakes.

212
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,039
That's right, the little dollops, the little delicious dollops that my mother used to call them.

213
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,039
By the way, these make a spectacular addition to sandwiches,

214
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:50,039
and are one of my favorite quick and easy breakfast items.

215
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:54,039
In addition to the chicken, the other ingredients you'll need are two to one eggs,

216
00:42:54,039 --> 00:43:00,039
two to half tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar,

217
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:03,039
two teaspoons of white wine, one tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese,

218
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,039
half teaspoon of kosher salt, one teaspoon of nutmeg,

219
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,039
half a teaspoon of ginger for a little bit of a kick,

220
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:16,269
two teaspoons of minced garlic. I thought I was going to sneeze.

221
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:22,980
I'm sorry, folks. One teaspoon of oregano, two teaspoons of lemon juice,

222
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,980
one tablespoon of vegetable oil. There's some salt in there.

223
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,980
I'm getting a sneeze, ladies and gentlemen. I'm sorry.

224
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,980
In a bowl, beat the eggs. Just any typical nonstick bowl.

225
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:38,349
In a nonstick skillet over medium flame, melt the butter.

226
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,349
After butter starts to brown and sizzle, add the eggs.

227
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,349
Pour eggs into the skillet and make sure the eggs are covered.

228
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:48,349
And add some vinegar. Bring the eggs to a boil.

229
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:51,349
Remove the chicken on a plate and cook the cooked chicken

230
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:54,349
on the bottom of the skillet until it's done.

231
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:57,349
About four to five minutes. This allows you to control,

232
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:01,349
if not remove, chicken completely where it lands on the skillet.

233
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:17,260
Bring the eggs to a boil is where I had a problem.

234
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,500
It wasn't even the chicken part. The chicken cooked the cooked chicken

235
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,500
is funny, but like bring the eggs to a boil is funnier.

236
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:33,739
God damn, that's fucking so stupid.

237
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:44,269
Boil your eggs. But you're cracking them in water?

238
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:46,269
I don't know, what does it even want me to do?

239
00:44:46,269 --> 00:45:32,369
Damn it, man. Why do they all have to be like this?

240
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:45,659
This is not going to make a lasagna.

241
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:53,670
Ugh, I can't believe it.

242
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,670
I found my mother's secret lasagna recipe in the attic,

243
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,670
exclaimed the young hostess.

244
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,670
And I really have never felt better in my life.

245
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,670
She made it. I thought the best way to see it was to make it myself.

246
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,670
I bought a brand and then it was a challenge to learn to make it.

247
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,670
I took the challenge along with the ingredients.

248
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,670
First, I prepared five eggs and three pieces of white bread.

249
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,670
The eggs turned out well. In fact, the batter was actually just too light.

250
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,300
But the white bread was a great help.

251
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,300
I did make the same mistake as my daughter.

252
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
I added too many cheese.

253
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,469
The result? Too much.

254
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:34,469
With all sorts of strange and unpleasant taste to say the least,

255
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:36,469
but it made for a great lunch.

256
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,900
I made it without the eggs.

257
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
It made for one of my favorite lunches,

258
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:46,210
which we call the frozen foe because of its very good flavor.

259
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,769
The ingredients are as follows.

260
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:56,590
One pound whole wheat flour, three fourths cup, half cup of sugar,

261
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:02,969
one tablespoon of baking powder, sour cream.

262
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:06,780
That's the whole recipe for lasagna.

263
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:15,250
I wonder why it didn't taste very good.

264
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,250
You wonder why that wouldn't be very flavorful.

265
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:22,550
Because you essentially made shitty cookies.

266
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:39,530
How much sour cream does it even tell you?

267
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,530
It doesn't even tell you the amount of sour cream.

268
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:49,699
It just says to put some in.

269
00:47:49,699 --> 00:48:17,030
All right, this is the last recipe.

270
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:45,320
Wait, there was no cheese in that recipe.

271
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
All right, the first part of this is fucking good.

272
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,320
Second part is just nonsense.

273
00:48:49,320 --> 00:49:01,969
I found a treasure map to a recipe.

274
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:02,969
It was this one.

275
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:07,969
I found it in the book called The Art of Making Homemade Pastries.

276
00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:11,340
If you don't like the ingredients, just use the recipe.

277
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,340
This I felt was very misleading.

278
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,340
So I took the recipe, turned it upside down,

279
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,340
and I still found it in the book,

280
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,340
as I just thought the instructions included a hint

281
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,340
to not use a whole box of dough instead of the package that was packaged.

282
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,579
To make it this time, I just used three cups of all-purpose flour,

283
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:32,750
two packets of baking powder, and two eggs.

284
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,750
I went with almond flour, but the texture of it was kind of like regular all-purpose flour.

285
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,750
I would say it was close.

286
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,750
It seems I have never quite been able to find this dough that comes out nice and stiff.

287
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,750
A few times I baked it on both the top and bottom first,

288
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,750
but then I realized it was the wrong color for such a thin crust.

289
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,750
I could not be more proud to be a huge fan of my new favorite bread

290
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,750
to add to my repertoire of treats.

291
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:03,230
Now, if only it would come where?

292
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,230
The best part about this one is this.

293
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,230
Oh, just use the recipe. This is really misleading.

294
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:13,159
So I turned it upside down and it was still in the book.

295
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,159
Like, that was gonna make it disappear?

296
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:47,849
Almond.

297
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:54,530
What?

298
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,530
Uh, okay.

299
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,070
Almond flour is disgusting.

300
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:34,400
That's a pretty big pee pants moment right there.

301
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,469
Okay, no more recipes.

302
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:44,780
Almond flour is disgusting.

303
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,780
I'm ashamed to have even had the pleasure of using it.

304
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,780
I mean, I know it's made from almonds,

305
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,780
but what does it taste like other than that?

306
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:55,780
It's very low in protein and the almonds take a while to dry out.

307
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,780
So this is a big waste of money.

308
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,780
It's also gluten-free, or rather, if you want to get fancy, gluten-free bread dough.

309
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,780
But you'd be more than a little disappointed if you made it.

310
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:10,780
This recipe for chocolate cheesecake flakes came from a local grocery store in my hometown,

311
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,780
and I've used it a couple times now.

312
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,780
They have a fairly large selection of recipes from some of my favorite baking books,

313
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:20,780
but one of the recipes I really enjoyed was this recipe for chocolate cheesecake flakes.

314
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,780
The ingredients were easily accessible and the quality of the cheese was very high.

315
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,780
I wanted to try a recipe that wasn't gluten-free,

316
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,780
but had high protein in the form of almond flour.

317
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,780
They come out perfect with a little tweaking of a few things.

318
00:52:35,780 --> 00:53:04,929
This actually is real.

319
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:07,929
But I really enjoyed the...

320
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:53,730
I really enjoyed the recipe.

321
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,570
Let's see what... Holy shit, this food is gross.

322
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:24,079
Holy shit, this food is gross.

323
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,079
If it looks this bad, there is no way in hell that you're gonna eat it.

324
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,900
So it was a very satisfying experience.

325
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,900
My wife and I sat here and ate a couple of those hot dogs we saw on the street.

326
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,440
I love hot dogs.

327
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,440
They're simple and delicious, but are usually filled with stuff that makes your head hurt after a while.

328
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,440
I was really impressed with the variety of the various things in this.

329
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,440
I tried a few different options and, oh, were surprisingly good.

330
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,440
This is one of those places that you go when you need a little late-night snack

331
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
and don't want to take a table.

332
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
You'll be sitting near where the bar is.

333
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,440
I got here after the party was over and it was already a party of around 20.

334
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,000
This has become an established spot.

335
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,369
It's clean and the food is good.

336
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:07,369
Great for when you don't want to party but need a quick bite.

337
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:10,369
I will definitely be back to try their other items.

338
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:15,139
Came here to celebrate my husband's anniversary lunch.

339
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:17,139
They're eating off the ground.

340
00:55:17,139 --> 00:55:21,019
They're eating, like, off the street.

341
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:58,809
There's nothing here.

342
00:55:58,809 --> 00:56:15,829
It's too fucking goddamn.

343
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,550
Okay, okay, this one's fucked up.

344
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:52,309
Here we go.

345
00:56:53,309 --> 00:57:10,719
No, this is too intense.

346
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,619
I will leave a bad review on Yelp.

347
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:19,309
Why did your restaurant get a bad review?

348
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,550
The other guy at the checkout got a bad review.

349
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,860
My review is way better.

350
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,219
How did a customer get a bad review?

351
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:30,219
I've seen the cafes of hate and have seen that it's a really good thing,

352
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:33,219
a place people can go and hang out and laugh at things that bother them.

353
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:35,219
But even the few reviews out there that are negative

354
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:37,219
can easily be summed up in the words of a person.

355
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:39,219
That wasn't funny.

356
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:43,219
Not too long ago, we've received the following comment to our article on Comedy Central.

357
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:48,219
I was laughing my ass off, but then I felt sick and went to get my medicine.

358
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:50,219
The pharmacist said she'd just be right over,

359
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:52,219
so I gave her a call and she was right,

360
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,219
and I walked out of there with the flu.

361
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:57,219
I was just so grateful they were still open.

362
00:57:57,219 --> 00:58:00,019
That wasn't the end of it, though.

363
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:03,019
As people took it as a sign that you were not funny.

364
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:15,230
Not funny.

365
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:51,099
Our article on Comedy Central.

366
00:58:51,099 --> 00:59:27,880
Nope, not doing that one.

367
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,889
Talk to Transformers, the website, if you were curious.

368
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,699
This is not...

369
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,699
It's just a bunch of...

370
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,699
It's a bunch of words.

371
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,699
This is not...

372
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:06,179
It's just words on a...

373
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:10,059
German985 just made it into the top 500 on Twitch.

374
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:13,059
The next step was to get his custom character created.

375
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:16,550
This time around, he started by writing text on the screen.

376
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,300
This step took many hours.

377
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,300
Then German985 received an email from one of the top Twitch streamers in the world.

378
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,300
He was asked by Twitch for his opinion and feedback.

379
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,300
The chat window above was filled with his responses.

380
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,300
It's great I see so many people having fun streaming,

381
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,300
German985 said, and his stream was live with no issue.

382
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,300
In the Twitch chat, German985 was asked by a streamer about his character.

383
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,300
This time a lot more questions were asked and some feedback was received.

384
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,300
There were questions about the appearance and the way the movement looked and felt,

385
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,300
to the height he could reach on the stage,

386
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,300
the timing of the sword swings, and so on.

387
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,300
German985 told about the last thing he thought to check

388
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,300
if there was a potential fix to the character.

389
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,739
And the first few minutes of the stream he had a small hiccup.

390
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:27,809
Don't even need anything else.

391
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,710
This is... I don't...

392
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:13,710
No, I don't...

393
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:49,679
What?

394
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:51,679
What the fuck?

395
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,539
This is fucking so dumb.

396
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:00,230
Alright, I'm ready.

397
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:05,610
We need some other music for this.

398
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:18,019
This one is fucking crazy.

399
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:29,210
Here we go.

400
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:35,199
I am slightly below average height, which I know isn't ideal.

401
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,199
I'm five feet tall and I can wear shorts and a tight athletic shirt

402
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,199
that shows the tops of my underpants and also shows my thighs.

403
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:47,199
Since there is no other way to show the legs without exposing my bikini lines,

404
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,199
I don't have to keep any of the rest of my skin out of public view.

405
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:53,380
However, I do wear a bra, which leaves my breasts exposed.

406
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:59,550
So I'm not able to wear a bra while I swim in a pool, swim or do gymnastics.

407
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,239
The only other option I have to show my nipples is under a t-shirt.

408
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:07,239
However, as you can see in the photo on the left, that t-shirt is mostly skin.

409
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,239
So there is a part of me that would like to show myself while I'm wearing it.

410
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:15,739
The next choice, swim or do gymnastics, is not an option for most of the ladies at my age or age range.

411
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:19,739
I've always loved the workout part of summer and I do love dancing and dancing in a bikini.

412
01:04:19,739 --> 01:04:20,739
I understand.

413
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:32,619
The only other option I have to show my nipples is under a t-shirt.

414
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:37,940
However, as you can see in the photo, the t-shirt is skin.

415
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,940
So you don't have a t-shirt on.

416
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:45,739
That means you don't have a t-shirt on.

417
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:52,380
I wear a bra, which leaves me exposed.

418
01:04:52,380 --> 01:05:16,349
Hold on, I need to scroll through this one.

419
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:35,500
Is this gibberish? So it's another gibberish one.

420
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:44,739
I am way stronger than everyone here combined.

421
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:48,739
Because you never ask questions, because you don't know how to answer.

422
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:49,739
You're an asshole.

423
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:54,289
That's your only weakness though.

424
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:56,289
You can't change anything.

425
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:58,289
Oh, but you can.

426
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:01,289
You just need to have more faith. You can help this person.

427
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:03,289
I'm just sorry that I'm a dick.

428
01:06:03,289 --> 01:06:06,780
Why would someone like you want to help the person like me?

429
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,780
They just need help. They're doing fine without me helping.

430
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,019
I don't know. I never knew who this... I was helping. I never understood.

431
01:06:12,019 --> 01:06:14,019
I don't know why someone wanted to help though.

432
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:15,019
How can I help them then?

433
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,019
There's nowhere else to go.

434
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:18,329
You're not helping them. You don't know this guy.

435
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:20,500
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

436
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
This guy has taken so much from me and I can never repay him.

437
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:57,239
The end. Gibberish again.

438
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:29,460
Wrong title?

439
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:48,619
Ancestors the Humankind Odyssey.

440
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:57,000
What the hell is the name of this game?

441
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,760
Ancestor the Humankind Odyssey.

442
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:36,750
Here we go.

443
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:44,420
This is my Ancestors the Humankind Odyssey review.

444
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:50,859
And this week, I'm going to be reviewing some of the great role-playing campaigns currently being created.

445
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:57,029
The campaign I'm reviewing this week is the One Night Stand, which you can read my review of here.

446
01:08:57,029 --> 01:09:06,619
When the world and everyone within it is dying, it is up to the human species at the center of the universe to stand up to the forces of darkness.

447
01:09:06,619 --> 01:09:12,619
And darkness to stand up to the forces of good and fight for a vision of what is right.

448
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:18,350
So there's no other choice than to go and get something to eat and stay warm.

449
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:25,720
Which brings me to this fantastic adventure in which players take the role of the characters in the fictional town of Shady Hollow.

450
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,090
And through the power of the human spirit, most attempt to get a job done.

451
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:35,760
And that, I say again, isn't all that different from a regular game of Call of Cthulhu.

452
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:40,000
So yes, you're playing a modern-day pulp novel.

453
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's the same basic concept of an ordinary person facing off against hordes of evil to achieve their own individual salvation.

454
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,739
Good review.

455
01:09:49,739 --> 01:10:30,500
PogChamp. L-U-L-W-what-the-fuck PogChamp.

456
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:35,800
I don't know. I think it's like, I just play the game. I don't feel too much. It's just fun to be part of something that is fun.

457
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,550
You want to win? WWE.com.

458
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,100
And then, Pog. I want to win too.

459
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:46,100
But right now, it doesn't feel very good in the end.

460
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:52,100
It feels a little bit good to win every time, but then a little bit of pain later, but then it's fun.

461
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,399
Well, you've only been in this business for a year, so you probably aren't quite used to the grind.

462
01:10:57,399 --> 01:11:00,579
PogChamp. L-U-L-W-what-the-fuck PogChamp.

463
01:11:00,579 --> 01:11:05,579
I try. When I first started on NXT, the first week was probably the worst day of my life.

464
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:08,750
So that's one thing I try to learn from.

465
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:13,750
And also the whole, what are they doing out? What are they doing out when I cum this thing?

466
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,750
When people are on their last...

467
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:20,810
Is this a username though?

468
01:11:20,810 --> 01:12:10,970
What? What?

469
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:21,180
Social media emotes. Some of the best in the industry.

470
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:23,180
Is this all like info for real?

471
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:27,699
It's an industry with a ton of people and some great people.

472
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:29,699
With over 500,000 accounts on Instagram.

473
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,699
It's way less. It's way more than that.

474
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:36,699
With over 500,000 accounts on Instagram, hashtags, videos, and photo albums under its belt.

475
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:41,699
The company has a head start on Snapchat, which hosts around 100 million accounts.

476
01:12:41,699 --> 01:12:49,710
With a revenue of 4.8 billion US and growth in the US for the past two quarters of 2016.

477
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:53,710
At 17 and 18%, the success of Snap could prove to be a game changer.

478
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:59,720
Snapchat started as a photo sharing app for sharing brief photos of one's current location.

479
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,279
However, the company soon came under fire from critics who dubbed it revenge porn.

480
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:14,579
Snap launched its messaging service in 2012 and has since been rolled into its various media apps.

481
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:18,579
Including Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger.

482
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:25,579
Its stock market value has almost quadrupled since its acquisition by Facebook in 2013 for $2 billion.

483
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:33,029
However, the company recently unveiled what appears to be a departure into another media category, video.

484
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:15,630
This is fucked up. This is so stupid.

485
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:28,579
Okay, here we go. Who has the best Snapchat?

486
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,090
And it's a picture. It's a picture by the NFL, apparently.

487
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:39,090
NFL picked up to international football league December 29, 2015.

488
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:43,090
The NFL was on a full Twitter snapping alert Thursday night.

489
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:49,090
Tweeting out the name and phone number of every professional football player in the league.

490
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,520
This has gone too far.

491
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,520
Hashtag NFL is not okay.

492
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,520
To Snapchat, to NFL, and get your name and number.

493
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,420
What the NFL is doing is giving a shout out to Snapchat.

494
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:10,420
The league's tweet has been blasted by many players of all teams, including some outspoken veterans

495
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,420
that could easily see the hashtag trending on social media.

496
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,420
So it made sense for the league to respond in full force.

497
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,659
Disrespectful is the word that springs to mind when you look at this tweet.

498
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:28,659
The NFL has done more disrespect by tweeting about the Snapchat app over a video than it's done by doing something else.

499
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:37,300
Tweeting out the name and phone number of every single player in the league.

500
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:46,510
Every single fucking player.

501
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:52,250
For what reason?

502
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:56,250
It's like, there's no reason to do that.

503
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,550
Hey, everybody, big football fans.

504
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,550
Hey, it's the NFL, the official NFL Twitter.

505
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:07,550
Here's the fucking personal information of everybody.

506
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:09,729
That's so bad.

507
01:16:09,729 --> 01:16:18,100
This fucking thousands and this thousands of people in the league.

508
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,600
Oh my God.

509
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:30,880
And how do you tweet that out in one picture?

510
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:47,180
That is a sixty seven thousand by forty one thousand resolution picture.

511
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:53,420
You really have to zoom the fuck in.

512
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,420
And they compress it.

513
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:07,250
Two pixels for every player.

514
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:15,539
God, that's ridiculous.

515
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:24,210
Oh, the official NFL Twitter.

516
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:27,149
OK, let's try.

517
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:30,029
And I love how that's supposed to be a shout out.

518
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:32,029
They're giving a shout out to Snapchat somehow.

519
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:36,829
That's their shout out to Snapchat.

520
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:40,829
Hey, Snapchat, great to be a partner. Partner with the NFL.

521
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:49,340
I like these ones. These are fun.

522
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:59,369
You know, my favorite part about that is names and phone numbers.

523
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:05,060
Names.

524
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,430
I don't know, Tom Brady. Oh, I know Tom Brady.

525
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:46,439
OK, this is, this one is going to be fun to read, but it's dog shit.

526
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:55,270
Grandpa, tell me a story.

527
01:18:55,270 --> 01:19:04,159
The boy goes to his grandpa's house for dinner and his grandpa tells him a story.

528
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:09,909
I'm sure he'll enjoy reading this and I'm sure I'll enjoy hearing it.

529
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:12,909
The boy is a little excited about the meal.

530
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:19,279
Grandpa is going to make him cheese, but the grandpa is just bored with the story.

531
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,970
A little boy is bored by the news.

532
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:27,340
Grandpa tells the boy something interesting and the little boy is happy.

533
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:33,010
His grandpa then goes to another room and tells the boy a new story and the boy is still happy.

534
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:36,890
A little boy is still happy from his favorite story.

535
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,060
The grandpa doesn't know what is to come.

536
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:44,750
The boy is surprised that his grandpa has no idea what's about to come.

537
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,250
A boy is bored with his grandpa's dinner.

538
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,189
The boy takes off running.

539
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:55,189
I don't know why, but I think that boy needs space.

540
01:19:55,189 --> 01:20:00,689
The boy hears footsteps on the steps he left behind, I assume.

541
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:32,539
This is just like research data.

542
01:20:32,539 --> 01:21:38,199
This one is also just like, just nonsense.

543
01:21:38,199 --> 01:22:09,539
I just want, it's just, it's generating this over and over again.

544
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:13,289
It really is not though, it's not.

545
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:38,569
I completely disagree with what I just brought up.

546
01:22:38,569 --> 01:22:46,520
Uh, Kraft macaroni and cheese is the best.

547
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:50,520
Kraft macaroni and cheese is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had.

548
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,520
You really need to try it. I promise you'll go back for seconds.

549
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,699
I think this is my favorite macaroni and cheese I've ever eaten.

550
01:22:58,699 --> 01:23:00,699
It's creamy without the cheesy texture.

551
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:04,000
And it makes for a great lunch with a veggie side.

552
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I usually use the ground beef mixture to make a filling meatloaf.

553
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I also love to make macaroni and cheese over a bed of lettuce

554
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,180
and use some leftover shredded carrots.

555
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:17,180
There's no reason you can't use some leftover vegetables and potatoes

556
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:21,479
with some of the vegetables from this recipe when you're making your meatloaf.

557
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:24,479
It's very easy to make something awesome over the top of meatloaf

558
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,939
if you make some additional layers as well.

559
01:23:28,939 --> 01:23:32,939
My latest videos, the meatloaf is really rich and full of flavor.

560
01:23:32,939 --> 01:23:35,939
I can't wait to eat it with an apple or cheese on top.

561
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:39,939
You can leave out the macaroni and cheese, it's really easy to make in a crock pot.

562
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:43,140
It.

563
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,140
Just leave out the mac and cheese, fuck it.

564
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:50,659
A larger model. What is that?

565
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:54,630
At least a larger model.

566
01:23:54,630 --> 01:24:02,489
What does this one do?

567
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:04,489
Oh, it's already implemented, okay.

568
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:10,949
Is there a way? It's already in here?

569
01:24:10,949 --> 01:25:19,430
They're not good.

570
01:25:51,289 --> 01:25:54,289
This is not me, by the way. This is not the store.

571
01:25:56,909 --> 01:25:59,729
I guess it could be.

572
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:06,939
This could be.

573
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,600
Alright!

574
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:19,180
Six Flags sucks.

575
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,180
But the food is good.

576
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:25,810
It's like a family dining table for my friends and family.

577
01:26:25,810 --> 01:26:28,810
Our menu is small but the service is friendly and attentive.

578
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:32,810
We'll all do four courses tonight, please call us.

579
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:35,810
I went there in January and they seem to have been open most of the time.

580
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:38,810
Had a great ambience, good wine, great price.

581
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:43,810
And I felt like coming here was good for me because I'm pretty overweight and a dietitian.

582
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:45,810
So I'm not that big of a picky eater.

583
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:49,810
It's pretty small but we had a table and the waitresses were friendly and attentive.

584
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:52,810
So come on down to Six Flags!

585
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,810
Not a star for what they did here.

586
01:26:54,810 --> 01:27:03,810
But we were there in January before Christmas and waited about an hour to be seated and was immediately greeted by a waitress.

587
01:27:03,810 --> 01:27:07,810
I had a bottle of water so I got a glass of wine to drink and eat while I waited.

588
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:12,810
Service was friendly but somehow slow as there seemed to be a lot of staff.

589
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:14,810
I was also disappointed with the food.

590
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:16,810
This is the cheapest place to get a plate of food.

591
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:56,489
Okay.

592
01:27:56,489 --> 01:28:55,329
What? Hold on.

593
01:28:55,329 --> 01:29:00,319
This is not... Is this fake?

594
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:11,479
They're all fake.

595
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:12,479
What am I talking about?

596
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:20,220
This is the only funny line in here.

597
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:40,729
Oh god.

598
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:43,310
What?

599
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:47,220
Oh god damn it.

600
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:49,220
These are all so... This is gibbering.

601
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:54,079
No, no, no. You're not supposed to... We're not supposed to...

602
01:29:54,079 --> 01:30:02,310
We're not doing the... We're not doing the Venga boys.

603
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:16,479
Okay, we are now.

604
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:21,279
Get on that bus!

605
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:32,500
Six flags eating contest with different styles such as the ones that look really neat with red stripes, yellow stripes, and black for the last one.

606
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:41,500
The second was for the 3D printed flag that looks like this and also the 1.7 gigabyte file where I show how it can be made in Photoshop.

607
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,500
The 3D printing process is similar to the printing process for the flag.

608
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:50,500
In case you're wondering, yes, the flag is made from cardboard for the same reason a flag from an archive folder is.

609
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:56,500
Step one, create a folder that contains two layers, one for the flag and another for the flag file inside.

610
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Step two, I'm doing that because for the flag I'd rather keep it small and as simple as possible so that it's not hard to follow.

611
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:09,500
Step four, open the main.png file inside.

612
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Step five, in your new folder you'll need to go to the two layers that are inside the flag file folder as shown in the picture.

613
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:21,500
Step six, go to step three because you didn't do it.

614
01:31:21,500 --> 01:32:12,579
This is fucking nonsense.

615
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:15,579
Alright, let's try this one.

616
01:32:15,579 --> 01:32:23,340
Unlucky.

617
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:26,350
Number 13.

618
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:33,140
What a terrible day.

619
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:39,939
But at least I'm not in a coma or some kind of superimposed vision.

620
01:32:39,939 --> 01:32:46,260
You have no idea how much it means to me that my son is finally coming home.

621
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:50,810
He's a hard worker and was the one who taught me math.

622
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:57,109
He's a good kid, but he never seemed to get what life or the Internet was really about.

623
01:32:57,109 --> 01:32:59,420
He played all the time.

624
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:03,420
He took the same interest in a game that everybody else did.

625
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,979
That was the only thing that made us a family.

626
01:33:05,979 --> 01:33:10,500
Then his mom decided to get sick of the Internet.

627
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:17,060
She couldn't do any work, couldn't do any online shopping because the Internet had made her life unbearable.

628
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:25,729
So she gave up her job at the local grocery store, took the truck driver job, and she became a waitress to get some extra income.

629
01:33:25,729 --> 01:33:32,479
And then she quit her job as a waitress and she went back to school because she always had something to do in school.

630
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:41,729
She finally made it to the point where she had enough credits to open an online account at work and did just that.

631
01:33:41,729 --> 01:33:49,500
Yes, she did. And there's more.

632
01:33:49,500 --> 01:34:06,300
And with these credits, she bought the necessary equipment to start her own business.

633
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:14,090
At that time, however, she still found employment as a cook.

634
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:19,090
When this job expired, it was easy pickets for other students hoping to get a job for themselves.

635
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:24,970
One of the best places to start is with an online site like this for entry-level opportunities.

636
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:27,970
For example, with online career fairs.

637
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:32,720
Aspiring chefs are a bit different from the ones I had grown up around.

638
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:39,720
For example, they are not only more educated but also more likely to earn the credentials needed to open a food service business.

639
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:47,149
To become the next generation of culinary experts, it is vital for them to get their hands dirty with real work.

640
01:34:47,149 --> 01:34:53,100
In order to do this, they need to take their apprenticeship programs very seriously.

641
01:34:53,100 --> 01:35:00,750
I met a lot of great people, including some of my colleagues at the Food Service Industry Association, during that internship period.

642
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:06,380
The people who took me under their wing were some of the most down-to-earth and down-to-earth people I've ever met in my life.

643
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:36,989
And that's when the accident happened.

644
01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:43,220
Well, I guess the question is, who is it?

645
01:35:43,220 --> 01:35:47,229
Anyway, this one was a bit odd to read.

646
01:35:47,229 --> 01:35:50,229
I've heard rumors that it goes like this.

647
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:53,539
People that have a lot of money like to gamble.

648
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:57,420
The only way to do that is to have an umbrella.

649
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:01,100
I've heard that it's also a sign, a warning.

650
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,100
A sign to say something.

651
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,539
A sign with something to say.

652
01:36:05,539 --> 01:36:07,539
But I don't remember anything like that at all.

653
01:36:07,539 --> 01:36:13,720
Well, the question is, what does a couple of umbrellas stand for?

654
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:17,430
It depends on the year.

655
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:20,430
I would have thought of it, but it was obvious.

656
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:25,430
But if it was a couple of umbrellas, then I think the message was a little too obvious for me to think.

657
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:28,430
The question is, is it a sign from someone who wanted a warning of something?

658
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:31,430
And if so, is that a sign?

659
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:37,380
I feel a little more doubtful of the message being a warning than a warning from the person.

660
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:49,050
Is that a warning? What is it?

661
01:36:49,050 --> 01:37:04,819
That warning.

662
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:09,340
Please, no, let me tell you this. It's my fault.

663
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:23,350
As she stood in front of him as through the shadow of the trees, the air around her was filled with the perfume of spring flowers and the grass was full of golden fragrant grass of the mountains.

664
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:30,770
You think there's trouble down at the other end of the woods that isn't even here a hundred years ago?

665
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:31,770
The girl asked.

666
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,770
And where, can you tell me?

667
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:37,140
We don't know.

668
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,140
Do you remember the forest?

669
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:40,829
She shook her head.

670
01:37:40,829 --> 01:37:44,140
All I remember is the grass and everything else about it was so empty.

671
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:45,140
So empty.

672
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:46,140
So empty.

673
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:49,569
We can't even be sure that it's still here.

674
01:37:49,569 --> 01:37:51,000
Yeah.

675
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It turned to walk away without looking back.

676
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
We have to remember.

677
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,939
There are people down here.

678
01:37:58,939 --> 01:37:59,939
They're looking for us.

679
01:37:59,939 --> 01:38:00,939
They're coming.

680
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:31,329
And then, as though she had imagined it, they appeared to be a different set of individuals, both in appearance and behavior, said police department chief Steve Priest.

681
01:38:31,329 --> 01:38:36,329
It appears there are non-members of the public and we are looking at them as potential witnesses.

682
01:38:36,329 --> 01:38:46,329
When asked if he thought that they may have fled the scene and gone into hiding, Mr. Priest said, I would think, I'd like to think it depends on when those guys got into the car.

683
01:38:46,329 --> 01:38:48,329
If they're actually on board.

684
01:38:48,329 --> 01:44:49,420
Oh, well, just get the ride.

685
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:53,420
Then the next day he comes back with a ride for $55.

686
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,489
Which...

687
01:45:10,869 --> 01:45:42,859
Hey, Lyft can be crazy in these markets.

688
01:45:42,859 --> 01:45:58,859
The driverless cars are now being piloted by hundreds of thousands of students and employees around the world who take UberPool in the US, UberX in Australia, GrabTaxi in Europe, Airbnb in Africa, and dozens of others.

689
01:45:58,859 --> 01:46:04,859
The company has been rolling out its program using taxis in Europe.

690
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:17,720
The company has been rolling out its program using taxis in Europe for several months and is also rolling out a pilot program with private transport operators in cities like London.

691
01:46:17,720 --> 01:46:28,090
It announced in late April that UberPool, a program where customers pay a flat rate up to $1 each way, to share with anyone could end this summer in Chicago.

692
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:42,060
A number of other governments, including the United Kingdom, the United States, and India, are now considering whether regulations that would ban companies from driving commercially on city roads will actually prevent self-driving cars.

693
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:51,539
Uber said in a statement on April 12th that it had not yet tested a self-driving car in London and would have to work with the city to make a decision.

694
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:54,220
The company is testing a cell...

695
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,220
Uber.

696
01:46:56,220 --> 01:47:27,010
This is another fucking ridiculous one.

697
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:29,010
This one is just...

698
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:45,710
My Uber driver was insane IRL.

699
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:48,710
I was scared we'd get arrested and fined for speeding.

700
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:50,710
He was so friendly and friendly.

701
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:57,210
I felt so blessed to be the first picket passenger in my Uber ride home at 10am.

702
01:47:57,210 --> 01:48:01,770
I never dreamed my Uber driver would be the most caring friend a person could ask for.

703
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:06,390
You are in need of a friend in an Uber or Lyft.

704
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:09,020
This is the guy.

705
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:11,510
I've had an Uber car for over three years.

706
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:18,510
I've had plenty of issues, but the one that made me take this last trip is so far the worst was with the driver.

707
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,510
He got upset and wanted me to leave his office.

708
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:24,510
He was very improved with me in person and had to get my money back.

709
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:29,010
I'm never returning and my phone is silent since I left Uber.

710
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:37,869
I had an excellent 3 out of 5 stars because of the quality of service of the driver and his demeanor of not being an asshole.

711
01:48:37,869 --> 01:48:42,050
He was attentive to us and did not make me feel anxious.

712
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:44,050
That's all I could ask from Uber.

713
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:51,449
Overall, it was really good.

714
01:48:51,449 --> 01:48:53,449
He left his office.

715
01:48:59,069 --> 01:49:01,069
Fucking office.

716
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:47,520
Oh, another one.

717
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:55,340
My Uber driver was name is not on the record in the book.

718
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:58,340
What I really want is name on book.

719
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:00,340
So I called the police.

720
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:03,420
This was around 7pm.

721
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:12,890
They say I'm stealing name on book.

722
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:14,890
This was at a restaurant in my neighborhood.

723
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:16,890
I'm not a thief. I'm just a girl from the community.

724
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:21,600
I'm just going to try to stay out of more trouble.

725
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:26,600
They sent me to a police station and I wait out there like I'm a child at a birthday party or something.

726
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,210
They take my name. This music is very loud.

727
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:34,180
I'm also dropping frames.

728
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:37,180
They sent me to a police station and I wait out there like I'm a child at a birthday or something.

729
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:41,739
I fill out some forms and they send me my summons.

730
01:50:41,739 --> 01:50:45,050
If you look at the map, you'll probably see a lot of white dots.

731
01:50:46,050 --> 01:50:50,050
But the cops have my name and the time and the phone number.

732
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:52,050
One cop said I was an adult when I called.

733
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:54,050
I'm like, Whoa, dude, but it's not illegal.

734
01:50:54,050 --> 01:50:57,050
If you were 16, you were not supposed to be calling the police.

735
01:50:57,050 --> 01:51:07,100
The whole last one for Uber and Lyft.

736
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:27,899
I don't know.

737
01:51:27,899 --> 01:51:32,029
This could be I don't know if this could be like factual.

738
01:51:32,029 --> 01:51:34,029
OK, here we go.

739
01:51:34,029 --> 01:51:55,460
We need different music for this one.

740
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:57,630
Uber and Lyft are a scam.

741
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:03,970
They have no business being on the roads in any city in America or the world.

742
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:07,720
And even in New York, they don't operate legally.

743
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:16,340
Uber and Lyft are just the tip of a giant iceberg iceberg of illegal, unsafe and unlicensed ride sharing services.

744
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:22,659
Here's why. Number one, illegal ride share rides to taxi zones.

745
01:52:22,659 --> 01:52:26,659
As Lyft and Uber were introduced to the public with a media blitz in 2014,

746
01:52:26,659 --> 01:52:31,659
their ride sharing platforms were just the start of a much larger illegal network.

747
01:52:31,659 --> 01:52:38,159
From Seattle to Boston based Uber's ride hailing platform had been banned

748
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:42,159
and at least five other cities with a combined population of more than seven hundred thousand.

749
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:49,640
As a result, the average driver's annual earnings would be more than thirty thousand dollars.

750
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:54,989
Many cities are still enforcing Uber and Lyft regulations,

751
01:52:54,989 --> 01:52:57,989
but they're often not the most fair way to run the business.

752
01:52:57,989 --> 01:53:02,989
By allowing these illegal Uber and Lyft ride sharing services to operate legally in a city,

753
01:53:02,989 --> 01:53:06,989
cities are forcing Uber and something else.

754
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:19,180
Okay, one more. What the fuck is wrong with my brain?

755
01:53:19,180 --> 01:54:24,670
I'm not reading this. What the fuck?

756
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:29,220
All right, here we go.

757
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:40,729
My Lyft driver was crazy about Uber, said the man sitting across from us as he waited in the dark, sweaty traffic.

758
01:54:40,729 --> 01:54:42,970
He was a real Uber driver.

759
01:54:42,970 --> 01:54:48,590
Uber is a ride sharing app that uses a car to shuttle passengers around the city.

760
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:52,409
But as Uber became increasingly popular with riders,

761
01:54:52,409 --> 01:54:58,270
it raised some eyebrows when it became partnering with ride sharing services instead.

762
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:05,829
And now for some people it feels like Uber is doing to ride share services what it does to taxis just without your fingertips.

763
01:55:05,829 --> 01:55:14,289
The question then is how can ride share apps be made safer and more transparent in order to keep passengers safe

764
01:55:14,289 --> 01:55:18,289
and Uber drivers less tempted to cheat their passengers?

765
01:55:18,289 --> 01:55:21,529
We spoke to drivers like the one across from ours.

766
01:55:21,529 --> 01:55:24,770
There are currently over two thousand Uber drivers across the country.

767
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:28,770
Many of whom have been with the company for up to six years.

768
01:55:28,770 --> 01:55:35,119
We spoke with them about the company's culture and the risks they face and then asked them to share their experiences.

769
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:42,449
Lyft driver Dan for one believes that Uber and Lyft are a double what?

770
01:55:42,449 --> 01:56:23,369
We need to know. This is just this is not even funny.

771
01:56:23,369 --> 01:56:28,380
Lyft driver Dan for one believes that Uber and Lyft are a double edged sword.

772
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:31,619
Rather than giving their drivers a better sense of ownership,

773
01:56:31,619 --> 01:56:34,619
a lot of drivers are still learning the ropes.

774
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:36,619
Gathering and self-driving vehicles are a risk to what we do.

775
01:56:36,619 --> 01:56:40,619
And it's very important that we're not putting our drivers in harm's way when we're putting other in our vehicle.

776
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:45,619
Also, this company is supporting technology, self-driving vehicles that abuse public allow drivers to check the weather and take photos.

777
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:48,619
And at the same time, driverless vehicles literally take more and more of the taxis business.

778
01:56:48,619 --> 01:56:51,619
And the biggest threat to our tax industry is that indoor use is declined.

779
01:56:51,619 --> 01:56:54,619
But the future of driving remains far away because so far the markets don't have that one or two players.

780
01:56:54,619 --> 01:56:56,619
We're linked to Google. This was like accurate.

781
01:56:56,619 --> 01:57:09,479
All right, this is the last one.

782
01:57:09,479 --> 01:57:15,619
Is this a bounty?

783
01:57:15,619 --> 01:57:18,619
A bounty for talk to Transformers?

784
01:57:18,619 --> 01:57:27,199
OK, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

785
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,199
Jesus fucking Christ.

786
01:57:30,199 --> 01:57:35,939
Thank God. I fucking go.

787
01:57:35,939 --> 01:57:41,380
How the fuck do you spell this stupid thing?

788
01:57:41,380 --> 01:58:04,479
I don't know.

789
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:09,789
I'm not reading another recipe.

790
01:58:09,789 --> 01:58:12,789
No more recipes.

791
01:58:12,789 --> 01:58:21,020
All right, this is the last one and then I'm going to get out of here.

792
01:58:21,020 --> 01:58:22,020
We're going late.

793
01:58:22,020 --> 01:59:44,109
This one sucks.

794
01:59:44,109 --> 01:59:55,479
And then the monster peered around the corner, his hundred teeth grinning at us, blood dripping from his mouth.

795
01:59:55,479 --> 02:00:01,090
The monster was a beast, a monster that couldn't be killed.

796
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:08,140
There was an old man, one who knew the town, and the old man came and told us,

797
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:13,789
These people will die if I don't do something about the monsters.

798
02:00:13,789 --> 02:00:17,789
They're killing your kids and killing our old lady.

799
02:00:17,789 --> 02:00:20,420
It's so sad.

800
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,680
He told us he was the local mayor.

801
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:29,180
He didn't like the goblins because he said the goblins would always be looking for someone to kill.

802
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:37,170
The people in this town were so scared that they would run out from inside to get away from them if they ever came near them.

803
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:39,979
But the old man said,

804
02:00:39,979 --> 02:00:44,479
Let's do what the old man doesn't do and get rid of the monsters.

805
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:46,420
And so we did.

806
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:52,779
You might think that a town in the middle of nowhere doesn't fit in with modern society.

807
02:00:52,779 --> 02:00:59,020
But in fact, it is a small, sleepy, sleepy village with many local businesses like bookstores and inns and small farms.

808
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:03,090
The first time I saw the monster, the story ended.

809
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:48,439
I tried to stop the monster, but his jaw bit down and killed me.

810
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:51,640
He let me go for a little.

811
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:53,640
I'll never forget that feeling of getting up after that.

812
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,260
Hearing that, the man paused.

813
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:00,079
Was he an arboreal creature?

814
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:04,899
No one's ever seen it before, but I think he probably lived in grass.

815
02:02:04,899 --> 02:02:06,520
Grass?

816
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:09,340
This is the same land I've never seen.

817
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:12,470
They sat on the sand as they talked about their history.

818
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:16,470
They started their stories about how they got to where they are and where they will go next.

819
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:20,739
We left the palace a long time ago for the desert.

820
02:02:20,739 --> 02:02:22,359
The man smiled.

821
02:02:22,359 --> 02:02:23,859
Desert?

822
02:02:23,859 --> 02:02:25,659
No.

823
02:02:25,659 --> 02:02:32,659
After I got my hands on magic, I wanted to go anywhere in the world but a place as cool as Mount Olympus had just become too much.

824
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:34,960
I couldn't imagine not being able to see magic.

825
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,260
It was like the end of an era, the man said to himself.

826
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,260
What an era.

827
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,260
This is the end.

828
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:41,569
The end of an era?

829
02:02:41,569 --> 02:02:48,819
All right, last one.

830
02:02:48,819 --> 02:02:52,180
This is it.

831
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:57,260
This is it.

832
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,260
I'm going to end the stream.

833
02:02:58,260 --> 02:02:59,260
What a perfect one to go on.

834
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:00,260
Magic Mayor.

835
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:05,260
He has an incredible ability to not only tell you great stories about the game, but help you to develop games of your own and to become a part of the gaming world.

836
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,260
He loves it.

837
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,939
He loves it.

838
02:03:07,939 --> 02:03:55,289
I'm having trouble with this one.

839
02:03:55,289 --> 02:03:56,289
Let's get some of the music.

840
02:03:56,289 --> 02:03:58,289
This is the last one.

841
02:03:58,289 --> 02:04:04,960
A duck, a shoe, and a frog walk into a bar.

842
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:08,520
The bartender turns to the customers and says,

843
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,520
Hey, what's your favorite sandwich?

844
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,520
Ah, the stream's dead.

845
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:13,520
Hold on.

846
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,229
Let's do it again.

847
02:04:16,229 --> 02:04:17,229
Let's try this one one more time.

848
02:04:17,229 --> 02:04:20,659
A duck, a shoe, and a frog walk into a bar.

849
02:04:20,659 --> 02:04:23,220
And the bartender turns to the customers and says,

850
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:25,220
Hey, what's your favorite sandwich?

851
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:28,720
The people sitting at the bar turn to the customers and say,

852
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:30,720
Your pizza!

853
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:33,840
But these days he's on a tear.

854
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:37,840
And he says he thinks he really can be the most important man in the world again.

855
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:41,270
The only problem is his customers aren't going to buy it.

856
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:45,960
The most important man in the world is a guy who doesn't listen, he complains.

857
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:48,899
You have to listen first.

858
02:04:48,899 --> 02:04:50,899
And why should they?

859
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:57,039
The people in front of Mr. Trump, why should they take advice he can't deliver?

860
02:04:57,039 --> 02:05:05,039
They'd be taking advice from the guy who's been on the front lines in the battle between those who are powerful and those who are more powerless from the guy who said,

861
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:06,340
Don't be stupid.

862
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,779
Be polite.

863
02:05:07,779 --> 02:05:08,779
Be gracious.

864
02:05:08,779 --> 02:05:10,079
And be a man.

865
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:50,810
They'd be taking advice from the guy who can't even be bothered to answer his own questions, I think.

866
02:05:50,810 --> 02:05:52,810
Last one, I promise, from Kylo.

867
02:05:52,810 --> 02:05:57,500
It was nice to see you guys again, though.

868
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:02,500
Before you start doing anything here, make sure to back up your safes before posting it.

869
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:05,060
Oh, a few notes before you start.

870
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:07,369
Get a fresh character.

871
02:06:07,369 --> 02:06:10,369
If you have at least one character that wasn't in a full game save, make sure to add her.

872
02:06:10,369 --> 02:06:13,060
Make sure to use the correct save file.

873
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:16,060
All other versions will show up with the incorrect version from you.

874

Ahem, ahem, ahem.

876
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,640
Okay.

877
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:28,020
Coming soon to xVacation.

878
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:30,770
New and improved animation quality.

879
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:34,329
All new animations for the following skills.

880
02:07:34,329 --> 02:07:35,329
Bashing attack.

881
02:07:35,329 --> 02:07:36,329
Blunt attack.

882
02:07:36,329 --> 02:07:37,329
Kick.

883
02:07:37,329 --> 02:07:38,939
Kick.

884
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:39,939
Lightning.

885
02:07:39,939 --> 02:07:40,939
Kick.

886
02:07:40,939 --> 02:07:41,939
Lightning only.

887
02:07:41,939 --> 02:07:42,939
Kick.

888
02:07:42,939 --> 02:07:43,939
Stun.

889
02:07:43,939 --> 02:07:44,939
Kick.

890
02:07:44,939 --> 02:07:45,939
Stun only.

891
02:07:45,939 --> 02:07:46,939
Kick.

892
02:07:46,939 --> 02:07:48,430
Bash.

893
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:49,430
Kick.

894
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,859
Blunt.

895
02:07:50,859 --> 02:07:51,859
Kick.

896
02:07:51,859 --> 02:07:53,100
Bash only.

897
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:54,470
Kick.

898
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:55,470
Flat.

899
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:56,710
Kick.

900
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,710
Bash only.

901
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:58,710
Kick.

902
02:07:58,710 --> 02:07:59,710
Stun.

903
02:07:59,710 --> 02:08:00,710
Kick.

904
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:01,710
Stun only.

905
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:03,779
And kick.

906
02:08:03,779 --> 02:08:04,779
Bash.

907
02:08:04,779 --> 02:08:05,779
Animations for Sword Art Online 2.

908
02:08:05,779 --> 02:08:10,020
The vast sea of clouds, the southern seas, and the east blue sea.

909
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:14,100
When animating characters in the southern seas, they will not have that area as a region

910
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:16,260
so they will animate in the ocean.

911
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:21,260
Please keep in mind this update is on patch v version 0.2.8.

912
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:25,260
The current live build is 0.3.4.3.

913
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:27,260
So it's higher.

914
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,260
Actual patch notes.

915
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:30,260
Interesting.

916
02:08:30,260 --> 02:08:31,260
This is it.

917
02:08:31,260 --> 02:09:02,710
I'm such an epic coder, I can smash all lines of code.

918
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:43,020
Python, Rust, C++, you name it.

919
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:47,020
I don't know why, but I don't have the time for code reviews.

920
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,510
You'd be amazed what I'd do with code.

921
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:52,510
I'm probably the only one in the world that can write code well.

922
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:55,819
And my code is always awesome.

923
02:09:55,819 --> 02:10:00,060
I know the code is easy to explain, but I can explain it in 20 words or less and make

924
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:01,060
it understandable.

925
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:06,060
I like to write simple, elegant code so I can explain in more than 20 words.

926
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:10,060
But I think I'm going to get a C++ guy to help me out with my code review.

927
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:12,060
But what is there to say about that?

928
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,060
I think I'll go back to C++ in a month or so, at least.

929
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:16,060
I don't know.

930
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,060
But what is there to say about that?

931
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:20,060
I think I'll go back to C++ in a month or so, at least.

932
02:10:20,060 --> 02:10:25,789
But I'm also a guy that needs to make money, right?

933
02:10:25,789 --> 02:11:01,699
I'll fucking talk.

934
02:11:01,699 --> 02:11:17,359
These are all fucking...

935
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:42,260
What?

936
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:43,260
Hold on.

937
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:53,500
What the fuck?

938
02:11:53,500 --> 02:12:00,260
Let's try to process this one.

939
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:06,479
Fuck off, Jeremy, the bartender yelled and he started rifling through his pockets.

940
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:10,739
What kind of fucking bitch doesn't give money back?

941
02:12:10,739 --> 02:12:12,109
Oh, I don't know.

942
02:12:12,109 --> 02:12:14,109
Steve's face paled.

943
02:12:14,109 --> 02:12:15,109
The fear was gone from him.

944
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:17,109
The look of disgust and rage was gone from his face.

945
02:12:17,109 --> 02:12:18,109
He didn't even care about what happened right now.

946
02:12:18,109 --> 02:12:20,109
He just wanted to get a taste of his own medicine.

947
02:12:20,109 --> 02:12:21,109
Well, fuck me, this feels like a $100 bill.

948
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:24,109
Sir, would you mind if I handed over all of your cash?

949
02:12:24,109 --> 02:12:26,420
Sirs.

950
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:28,420
Fuck you, Steve, roared his anchor rising to new heights.

951
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:31,909
You can't fucking steal shit you paid for out of the restaurant.

952
02:12:31,909 --> 02:12:32,909
I gave you plenty of warning.

953
02:12:32,909 --> 02:12:35,979
Now I'm going to break your fucking legs.

954
02:12:35,979 --> 02:12:36,979
The bartender laughed.

955
02:12:36,979 --> 02:12:38,979
Ha ha ha ha, he said, making his escape.

956
02:12:38,979 --> 02:12:45,399
You have good manners as long as you're drunk and you'll think twice before you steal.

957
02:12:45,399 --> 02:12:46,399
What happened here?

958
02:12:46,399 --> 02:13:00,840
The bartender said fuck off, Jeremy, and stole money out of my pocket.

959
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:02,840
Sir, would you mind if I handed over all your cash?

960
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:04,840
Who said that?

961
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:09,409
I have no idea.

962
02:13:09,409 --> 02:13:13,949
But that's it.

963
02:13:13,949 --> 02:13:18,689
That's going to be it for me tonight.

964
02:13:18,689 --> 02:13:20,689
We've been going for a long time.

965
02:13:20,689 --> 02:13:28,560
So the streams this week are going to be kind of all over the place.

966
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:34,630
Because I have a couple of things I need to get done over the next day or two.

967
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:41,060
So what's going to happen is on Saturday, Star and I are going to do Terraria.

968
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:43,500
Friday, let's see.

969
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:47,800
So Friday, Saturday, Sunday is probably what we're going to do this weekend here.

970
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:51,319
That would make the most sense.

971
02:13:51,319 --> 02:13:54,750
So nothing over the next two days.

972
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,750
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

973
02:13:56,750 --> 02:14:04,060
I want to probably start Mario RPG.

974
02:14:04,060 --> 02:14:11,699
Remember we talked about that last week?

975
02:14:11,699 --> 02:14:13,699
I'm assuming that'll start probably this coming weekend.

976
02:14:13,699 --> 02:14:15,699
Probably Sunday or something.

977
02:14:15,699 --> 02:14:19,310
Actually going to do it.

978
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:20,310
I think so.

979
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:31,340
But besides that, Star and I are going to try to finish the base game of Terraria this weekend.

980
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:33,829
Ancestor Part II.

981
02:14:33,829 --> 02:14:36,829
I don't know if I can play Ancestor again.

982
02:14:36,829 --> 02:14:40,840
It was kind of a little too all over the place for me.

983
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:50,630
I really want to love that game, but I can't.

984
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:52,630
There's a lot of random things in the way for me.

985
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:55,149
It was funny.

986
02:14:55,149 --> 02:14:56,149
It was fun.

987
02:14:56,149 --> 02:15:02,210
It was a fun, funny game, but a little too frustrating, I think, in some aspects.

988
02:15:02,210 --> 02:15:11,529
But I'll see you guys on Friday.

989
02:15:11,529 --> 02:15:13,699
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

990
02:15:13,699 --> 02:15:17,100
We'll do some fun stuff.

991
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:21,550
Connect will probably come back.

992
02:15:21,550 --> 02:15:26,460
Yeah, Connect will probably be on Friday.

993
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:29,630
We will do a horror Connect night on Friday.

994
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:31,630
Saturday, Terraria.

995
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:35,810
And then Sunday, Mario RPG start.

996
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:39,579
I think that sounds like a pretty good plan.

997
02:15:39,579 --> 02:15:43,550
But thanks for joining me.

998
02:15:43,550 --> 02:15:44,550
Thanks for hanging out.

999
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:51,779
I'll see you guys on Friday.

1000
02:15:51,779 --> 02:15:57,159
Join me for more Connect.

1001
02:15:57,159 --> 02:16:02,729
And we'll get into the bits.

1002
02:16:02,729 --> 02:16:06,859
Let's go back to about eight hours ago.

1003
02:16:06,859 --> 02:16:08,359
Earlier.

1004
02:16:08,359 --> 02:16:12,689
We'll try to go through these fairly quickly because it is getting late.

1005
02:16:12,689 --> 02:16:16,310
It is 2 a.m. Eastern.

1006
02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:22,840
Later than that, even.

1007
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,840
So let's start with Gnarly gave $2.50.

1008
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:26,840
Thank you.

1009
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:29,840
How come Twilight Summoner from Hearthstone has not been in a rumble yet?

1010
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,840
He was your sub sound for a good while.

1011
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:36,700
Do him justice.

1012
02:16:36,700 --> 02:16:37,700
Oh, yeah.

1013
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:38,700
Wait.

1014
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:39,700
What?

1015
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,700
I can do better than that.

1016
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:41,700
Wait.

1017
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:42,700
What?

1018
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:43,700
Wait.

1019
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:44,879
What?

1020
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:45,879
What?

1021
02:16:45,879 --> 02:16:53,329
One of those worked.

1022
02:16:53,329 --> 02:17:01,069
Uh, there are a lot of characters that should have shown up in rumbles that never did.

1023
02:17:01,069 --> 02:17:02,069
But thank you, though, Gnarly.

1024
02:17:02,069 --> 02:17:04,069
Thank you, Master Chicken, for the $5.

1025
02:17:04,069 --> 02:17:09,069
The store manager that had a problem with my prescription medications got fired for trying to fire me for them.

1026
02:17:09,069 --> 02:17:12,500
So I can now continue slaving way to earn bits for you.

1027
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:16,500
Also, I have a huge image for the Where's Waldo, and it's too big for Discord.

1028
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:25,780
So you got one of those, like, huge ones.

1029
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:28,780
Well, is it possible to maybe compress it a little?

1030
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:34,200
But I'm really sorry to hear about that stuff at work.

1031
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:40,430
Imgur?

1032
02:17:40,430 --> 02:17:41,430
Oh, yeah.

1033
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:42,430
You can probably use Imgur.

1034
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:43,430
What are we linking here?

1035
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:44,430
What's this?

1036
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:45,739
Auto?

1037
02:17:45,739 --> 02:17:52,809
That game was, like, so fun, too.

1038
02:17:52,809 --> 02:17:54,809
Like, it was so interesting.

1039
02:17:54,809 --> 02:18:02,200
Like I told you, there's a box of gold underneath all that sand somewhere.

1040
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,629
There is.

1041
02:18:03,629 --> 02:18:07,450
I wonder if they patch the fuck out of it over the next, like, year.

1042
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:09,450
Maybe it'll be, like, really fun later.

1043
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:26,559
Who knows?

1044
02:18:26,559 --> 02:18:27,559
That's so funny.

1045
02:18:27,559 --> 02:18:30,489
But thank you for that.

1046
02:18:30,489 --> 02:18:32,489
And thank you, Master Chicken, for the $5.

1047
02:18:32,489 --> 02:18:34,489
Hopefully you get all your stuff at work sorted out.

1048
02:18:34,489 --> 02:18:37,620
Hey, Bitslay, thanks for the $5.

1049
02:18:37,620 --> 02:18:43,620
Hey, Jerma, I ran that nasty burger from last stream into Selfie to Anime AI.

1050
02:18:43,620 --> 02:18:52,750
What the fuck does that mean?

1051
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:53,750
What?

1052
02:18:53,750 --> 02:19:05,659
Why did you do this?

1053
02:19:05,659 --> 02:19:08,659
This is actually pretty cool.

1054
02:19:08,659 --> 02:19:10,659
Selfie to Anime.

1055
02:19:10,659 --> 02:19:16,899
Also, please wish me luck as I am stuck at an Air Force base waiting on orders.

1056
02:19:16,899 --> 02:19:18,899
It's the worst Air Force base I've ever been to.

1057
02:19:18,899 --> 02:19:20,899
And I'm losing my damn mind.

1058
02:19:20,899 --> 02:19:23,899
Can you ask the President for help on my behalf?

1059
02:19:23,899 --> 02:19:27,809
Well, I do wish you luck.

1060
02:19:27,809 --> 02:19:31,500
I believe that doesn't take too much longer.

1061
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:35,459
But thank you, Bitslay.

1062
02:19:35,459 --> 02:19:39,540
Hopefully you get some orders soon.

1063
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:44,739
Thanks for the lovely Anime hamburger McDonald's double cheeseburger picture.

1064
02:19:44,739 --> 02:19:51,459
Hey, Miniclips, thanks for $10.

1065
02:19:51,459 --> 02:19:53,459
Our ancestors didn't have tutorials or HUDs.

1066
02:19:53,459 --> 02:19:54,459
Just remember that.

1067
02:19:54,459 --> 02:19:57,940
Thanks for the $10.

1068
02:19:57,940 --> 02:20:00,620
And yes, you're right.

1069
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:06,079
Poo and Pee Party, thanks for the $5.

1070
02:20:06,079 --> 02:20:09,600
They say Stan?

1071
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:13,350
And then Luna?

1072
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:19,190
I don't know what that is, but thank you Poo Poo and Pee Pee Party, whatever your name was.

1073
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:21,190
Poo and Pee Party.

1074
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:24,370
Patrick Johnson, thanks for the $10.

1075
02:20:24,370 --> 02:20:27,370
Hey, Germans, I want to give a big thank you for the countless hours of entertainment you provided me.

1076
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:34,370
I work a pretty dire nightmare office job here in Wales, but your streams always manage to make it bearable.

1077
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:39,459
Thank you, Patrick.

1078
02:20:39,459 --> 02:20:40,459
Thank you for the $10.

1079
02:20:40,459 --> 02:20:43,340
I love streaming.

1080
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:44,340
I love hanging out.

1081
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:53,299
I love just making all kinds of fucking stuff.

1082
02:20:53,299 --> 02:20:54,299
What?

1083
02:20:54,299 --> 02:20:56,299
I got lost there in my brain.

1084
02:20:56,299 --> 02:20:59,299
I was thinking of the fucking Stan thing and I couldn't figure out what that meant.

1085
02:20:59,299 --> 02:21:04,299
And then like I was in the middle of talking and I ran into a wall.

1086
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:07,299
But no, I love being here.

1087
02:21:07,299 --> 02:21:08,299
I love streaming.

1088
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:15,479
Even though I didn't think the game was very fun and I wasn't doing very well in that fucking monkey game,

1089
02:21:15,479 --> 02:21:20,479
I still had a lot of fun playing it just because by its very nature, hanging out and, you know, talking shit.

1090
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:26,190
And, you know, I don't really mean half of it, but it's still fun.

1091
02:21:26,190 --> 02:21:28,190
Making all kinds of stuff, you know.

1092
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:37,899
Teleporting tigers are dumb.

1093
02:21:37,899 --> 02:21:42,899
Somebody that has time in that game that is more than like 10, 20, 30 hours.

1094
02:21:42,899 --> 02:21:46,389
Do you get like tigers spawned on top of you?

1095
02:21:46,389 --> 02:21:47,389
Does that happen?

1096
02:21:47,389 --> 02:21:49,389
I felt like that happened.

1097
02:21:49,389 --> 02:22:00,819
Or was I doing something wrong?

1098
02:22:00,819 --> 02:22:09,379
You weren't supposed to bring your whole clan out with you.

1099
02:22:09,379 --> 02:22:12,940
You were bringing out your entire clan.

1100
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:24,219
That's ridiculous.

1101
02:22:24,219 --> 02:22:27,219
In one of the clips, the tiger literally appears from thin air.

1102
02:22:27,219 --> 02:22:30,219
It spawned right where you are.

1103
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:45,100
Alright, I just wanted to make sure.

1104
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:47,100
I still had a fucking fun time though.

1105
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,100
Even though I like, I didn't even rage quit.

1106
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:50,100
People were saying, you rage quit.

1107
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:51,100
No, I didn't.

1108
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:53,719
I rage died.

1109
02:22:53,719 --> 02:22:54,719
All of them.

1110
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:55,719
Everybody.

1111
02:22:55,719 --> 02:22:56,719
All of us.

1112
02:23:02,819 --> 02:23:03,819
I think it was still worth playing.

1113
02:23:03,819 --> 02:23:12,270
But thank you to Patrick Johnson for the 10 bucks.

1114
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:14,020
Glad to be here.

1115
02:23:22,899 --> 02:23:36,870
Buffalo chicken is probably my favorite party food, I would say.

1116
02:23:36,870 --> 02:23:40,870
And now I'm making myself hungry and I'm going to have to figure out what am I going to eat.

1117
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:44,180
I think there's food in the fridge.

1118
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:45,180
I'm going to eat it.

1119
02:23:45,180 --> 02:23:46,860
But yeah, buffalo chicken.

1120
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:48,860
I'm a huge sub sandwich fan.

1121
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:51,860
I love Italian subs.

1122
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:53,860
I love buffalo chicken subs.

1123
02:23:53,860 --> 02:23:55,860
I love like steak and cheese subs.

1124
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:58,860
I love like Rubens.

1125
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:03,379
I'm a big sandwich kind of guy.

1126
02:24:03,379 --> 02:24:05,379
Pastrami, like a nice pastrami.

1127
02:24:05,379 --> 02:24:08,069
From a nice deli.

1128
02:24:08,069 --> 02:24:15,879
I would love to have my own deli.

1129
02:24:15,879 --> 02:24:18,879
I just, I'm not a talented fucking chef.

1130
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:19,879
I would just be there.

1131
02:24:19,879 --> 02:24:25,440
I would just want to own a deli just so I could eat the food that like hire like a talented person to make it all.

1132
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:31,200
But yeah, those are some of my favorite foods.

1133
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,040
Thank you.

1134
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:36,040
I don't even like Taco Bell for the $2.50.

1135
02:24:44,729 --> 02:24:48,950
Thank you for the $5.

1136
02:24:48,950 --> 02:24:50,950
I don't even like Taco Bell.

1137
02:24:50,950 --> 02:24:55,020
Hey Jerma, I'm not sure the emotes worked properly in my last donation.

1138
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:58,020
Did you delete Jerma Hairy Buttcheeks?

1139
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:02,020
I'd be awfully sad because Jerma Hairy Buttcheeks is my favorite emote.

1140
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:06,020
Spamming Jerma Hairy Buttcheeks is the only thing I love more than spamming...

1141
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:10,020
It's the backpack thing that I'm not going to read out loud.

1142
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:15,020
And Jerma is mad and bald because I'm so funny.

1143
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:22,739
I don't even like Taco Bell again for $2.50.

1144
02:25:22,739 --> 02:25:25,739
Hey Jerma, one last bit donation while I'm on break at work.

1145
02:25:26,739 --> 02:25:30,739
Can you drop a raid on Ital Chad tonight?

1146
02:25:30,739 --> 02:25:35,739
Seeing a bunch of hairy primates tonight reminded me that the notorious ETL doesn't get enough love in this community.

1147
02:25:35,739 --> 02:25:38,739
Jerma Hairy Buttcheeks.

1148
02:25:38,739 --> 02:25:45,850
That's not an emote, first of all.

1149
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:50,840
I did not delete that emote.

1150
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:55,530
So sorry to tell you that that's incorrect.

1151
02:25:55,530 --> 02:26:09,440
And second of all, Italics is not live right now.

1152
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:13,649
So I can't do that.

1153
02:26:14,649 --> 02:26:16,649
But I'll tell you something about Italics.

1154
02:26:16,649 --> 02:26:18,649
I think the two of us are going to play something together real soon.

1155
02:26:18,649 --> 02:26:20,649
There's a game coming out.

1156
02:26:20,649 --> 02:26:26,649
It's like a two-person horror, like choose your own horror kind of Until Dawn game.

1157
02:26:26,649 --> 02:26:30,940
We're going to be playing it together.

1158
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:36,549
I forget what it's called.

1159
02:26:36,549 --> 02:26:40,549
It's called like the Mad Land of Doctor something.

1160
02:26:40,549 --> 02:26:46,379
I don't know. Whatever it is. I have no idea.

1161
02:26:46,379 --> 02:26:48,379
I knew it if I would see it.

1162
02:26:48,379 --> 02:26:51,379
But it's like from the Until Dawn depth.

1163
02:26:51,379 --> 02:26:57,420
So yes, that'll probably be next week.

1164
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,420
Whenever it launches.

1165
02:26:59,420 --> 02:27:02,809
Thank you Razzle for the 250.

1166
02:27:02,809 --> 02:27:08,620
Hey Jerma, the first video of yours I watched was Grandpa Runs a Fast Food Joint and I think it's a hidden gem.

1167
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:10,620
Like I'm literally shitting and farting.

1168
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:12,620
Okay, thanks.

1169
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:22,620
Also as a side note, I showed a friend one of your second Jerma Stream highlight videos and they stopped talking to me.

1170
02:27:22,620 --> 02:27:23,620
Sorry to hear that.

1171
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:27,620
Thank you Jamie for the $5, Jamie2803.

1172
02:27:27,620 --> 02:27:34,500
Hey Jerma, I finally unlocked the 10,000 bit badge and I just want to say that I think you're the best streamer on Twitch by far.

1173
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:36,500
Keep doing what you're doing mate. Much love.

1174
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:39,250
I'm happy to hear that you think that.

1175
02:27:39,250 --> 02:27:41,739
There are a lot of people on this website.

1176
02:27:41,739 --> 02:27:43,739
There are a lot of choices.

1177
02:27:43,739 --> 02:27:51,309
And if you've chosen me, I hope you've made the right choice.

1178
02:27:51,309 --> 02:27:54,000
Right?

1179
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,969
In your mind.

1180
02:27:56,969 --> 02:27:57,969
I'm just glad you think that.

1181
02:27:57,969 --> 02:28:03,139
Because there are a lot of other people that stream that do very cool fun things on this website.

1182
02:28:04,139 --> 02:28:06,899
And you've decided to come here.

1183
02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:08,709
So thank you.

1184
02:28:08,709 --> 02:28:12,860
Really appreciate it.

1185
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:16,860
Also thank you to Cold Warhol for the $10.

1186
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:18,159
Howdy Jerma, hope you're having a good day.

1187
02:28:18,159 --> 02:28:21,159
This is the first stream of yours I've ever been to, able to catch, and it's been a blast.

1188
02:28:21,159 --> 02:28:23,159
Hope to be back for more.

1189
02:28:23,159 --> 02:28:26,299
Well hell yeah, welcome.

1190
02:28:26,299 --> 02:28:29,069
Thanks for the 10 bucks.

1191
02:28:29,069 --> 02:28:30,069
Thanks for sticking around.

1192
02:28:30,069 --> 02:28:32,069
I hope you enjoy it. I hope you have fun.

1193
02:28:32,069 --> 02:28:34,379
I'll see you on Friday maybe.

1194
02:28:34,379 --> 02:28:35,379
If you come around.

1195
02:28:35,379 --> 02:28:42,420
But welcome to the community.

1196
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:44,659
First stream I've been able to catch.

1197
02:28:44,659 --> 02:28:48,239
Thank you.

1198
02:28:48,239 --> 02:28:49,239
Man, boy, thanks for the 250.

1199
02:28:49,239 --> 02:28:54,459
This game is just overly complicated doodle god.

1200
02:28:54,459 --> 02:28:56,459
In a way, yeah, I can see that.

1201
02:28:56,459 --> 02:29:01,069
The great Canadian FK club.

1202
02:29:01,069 --> 02:29:03,069
Thanks for the $15 and the community subs.

1203
02:29:03,069 --> 02:29:12,389
Time for finger extended out and pointing to the sky.

1204
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:16,270
Thank you for the $15 great Canadian FK club.

1205
02:29:16,270 --> 02:29:20,520
Fuck, it's fuck club.

1206
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:21,520
Fuck, fuck.

1207
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:22,520
No, it's not.

1208
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:23,520
I got corrected like three times.

1209
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:24,520
It's like frick club.

1210
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:33,010
Thank you InvaderZ for the 250.

1211
02:29:33,010 --> 02:29:34,629
$2.50.

1212
02:29:34,629 --> 02:29:35,629
Your content makes me happy.

1213
02:29:35,629 --> 02:29:37,629
Here's pictures of my rats.

1214
02:29:37,629 --> 02:29:40,059
Leviathan and Judas.

1215
02:29:40,059 --> 02:29:54,340
Those are some cool ass names too.

1216
02:29:54,340 --> 02:29:57,790
Leviathan.

1217
02:29:57,790 --> 02:30:11,829
Hello.

1218
02:30:11,829 --> 02:30:14,860
They're very cute.

1219
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:17,190
Thank you for sharing.

1220
02:30:17,190 --> 02:30:19,190
Thanks for the 250.

1221
02:30:19,190 --> 02:30:22,010
They are adorable.

1222
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:30,329
Thank you 420Squid for the $10 thousand bits.

1223
02:30:30,329 --> 02:30:32,329
Hey, German just made this sick mashup.

1224
02:30:32,329 --> 02:30:35,329
It's you singing the ABCs as Broccoli's son in the Mind Show stream.

1225
02:30:35,329 --> 02:30:37,329
Over dance with me.

1226
02:30:37,329 --> 02:30:38,329
Hang on to this.

1227
02:30:38,329 --> 02:30:40,459
See, I told you.

1228
02:30:40,459 --> 02:30:43,459
Some of you maybe didn't believe me.

1229
02:30:43,459 --> 02:30:48,149
But people make shit all the time.

1230
02:30:48,149 --> 02:30:58,020
And we can start compiling these and have one of these community nights way sooner than a lot of people think.

1231
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:05,579
That channel for the Discord, by the way, will be open this weekend.

1232
02:31:05,579 --> 02:31:11,200
Tomorrow, no.

1233
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,200
But 420Squid, hang on to that video.

1234
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:26,700
420Squid is going to be a place for you to officially submit it so we can have as many people see it as we possibly can, including me, during our monthly community nights.

1235
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:28,700
Do you care if I use your voice as a sample in some music?

1236
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:29,700
Don't do that.

1237
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,700
Don't do that.

1238
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:31,700
Don't do that.

1239
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:32,700
No, I don't care.

1240
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:33,700
That's fine.

1241
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:47,340
As long as it's not like any TOS breaking stuff.

1242
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:48,340
But thank you 420Squid.

1243
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:50,979
Hold on to that.

1244
02:31:50,979 --> 02:31:55,120
Mark Meltzer, thanks for the three bucks.

1245
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:58,120
Hey, German, popping my donation here since I got my part-time job recently.

1246
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:02,120
Wanted to share this movie clip because I felt it related well to some parts of the stream.

1247
02:32:02,120 --> 02:32:07,340
Gotta get that fucking community Discord up.

1248
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:10,340
So many, like, good links that I want to watch.

1249
02:32:10,340 --> 02:32:16,489
This is exactly what I was talking about.

1250
02:32:16,489 --> 02:32:24,719
Would you accept an interpretive dance?

1251
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:40,860
Oh, this is like a full Nacho Libre movie clip.

1252
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:43,829
Hang on to this.

1253
02:32:43,829 --> 02:32:53,590
I want to try to, I want to make, I guess, I gotta say, I gotta try to say this, like, very clear so we can, like, clip it.

1254
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:54,590
Ready?

1255
02:32:54,590 --> 02:32:55,590
Here we go.

1256
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:04,270
If anybody asks, clip this.

1257
02:33:04,270 --> 02:33:16,379
For the future, any community-oriented videos, artwork, music, or fun, interesting content that you create

1258
02:33:16,379 --> 02:33:19,379
or that you pull out from the internet that is related to the channel,

1259
02:33:19,379 --> 02:33:29,260
put it into the Discord for the community nights, the monthly community nights, so we can show them all and show people.

1260
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:32,200
And we'll have a lot of fun doing it.

1261
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:44,670
For the future, I will not be watching videos or showing artwork or original community content at the end of streams.

1262
02:33:44,670 --> 02:33:52,500
There you go.

1263
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:55,870
We are going to save them for our big community nights.

1264
02:33:55,870 --> 02:34:05,879
I want to make sure I talk about it more and more and more and more.

1265
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:07,879
Clips can only be 60 seconds long.

1266
02:34:07,879 --> 02:34:08,879
Let's summarize.

1267
02:34:08,879 --> 02:34:09,879
Well, they'll get the idea.

1268
02:34:09,879 --> 02:34:22,780
They know we have to really talk about it.

1269
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:25,340
How long can it be?

1270
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:36,209
There will be official stuff there, but any video, I think, that would be longer than five minutes, ten minutes,

1271
02:34:36,209 --> 02:34:40,209
stuff like that, I think, would have to be kind of a special thing.

1272
02:34:40,209 --> 02:34:48,209
I don't really want to have a ton of big, long, ten-minute videos over there because people, I think, would get kind of...

1273
02:34:48,209 --> 02:34:51,209
It's almost like you get video exhaustion after a while.

1274
02:34:51,209 --> 02:34:59,520
So I think that the cap for just general video stuff will probably be about five minutes.

1275
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:02,719
Any more than that, I think, is a little too long.

1276
02:35:02,719 --> 02:35:06,719
But sometimes somebody makes something so good that obviously we have to waive that.

1277
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:15,979
But thank you, Mark Meltzer, for the three bucks.

1278
02:35:15,979 --> 02:35:29,309
And if you want to get a sneak peek, because that stream is going to happen soon, after this weekend, the first one.

1279
02:35:29,309 --> 02:35:31,309
I feel like there's going to be a lot of submissions.

1280
02:35:31,309 --> 02:35:36,090
I'm going to rip the Godfather and post it in the Discord.

1281
02:35:36,090 --> 02:35:38,090
Then you're going to get snapped.

1282
02:35:38,090 --> 02:35:39,090
You're going to get banned.

1283
02:35:39,090 --> 02:35:40,090
Don't do that.

1284
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:42,090
That's going to... You actually will get...

1285
02:35:42,090 --> 02:35:44,090
The mods aren't going to mess around, by the way.

1286
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:51,340
You will be banned from that Discord, from that channel.

1287
02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:55,340
You will not be able to post in that channel ever again.

1288
02:35:55,340 --> 02:36:01,329
Hey, thank you to Bike Richards for the 19 dollars.

1289
02:36:01,329 --> 02:36:03,329
Thank you, Bike Richards.

1290
02:36:03,329 --> 02:36:08,079
Jeremy, you need to have the apes discover wave dashing if you want to defeat the tiger.

1291
02:36:08,079 --> 02:36:11,260
Yeah, the new Planet of the Apes movie stinks.

1292
02:36:11,260 --> 02:36:23,709
Jacob had gave 30 bucks earlier.

1293
02:36:23,709 --> 02:36:28,299
Thanks for the 30 fucking dollars.

1294
02:36:28,299 --> 02:36:30,299
Jeremy, can you put on a monkey suit when playing this game?

1295
02:36:30,299 --> 02:36:32,299
I would overheat and pass out.

1296
02:36:32,299 --> 02:36:33,299
I don't think I could.

1297
02:36:33,299 --> 02:36:37,739
Thank you, though.

1298
02:36:37,739 --> 02:36:42,040
Thank you so much for the 33,000 bits, 30 bucks.

1299
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:43,040
Thank you.

1300
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,040
Jeremy, will you play this game again?

1301
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:48,899
No.

1302
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:55,000
I will play Ancestors again if there's a tiger patch.

1303
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,940
Minus 25% spawn rate.

1304
02:36:57,940 --> 02:37:07,930
Maybe after a few updates.

1305
02:37:07,930 --> 02:37:09,930
Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to write it off completely.

1306
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:15,620
I wanted to love it so much.

1307
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,620
But, it's okay.

1308
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:22,340
But thank you, Jacob, for the 30 bucks.

1309
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:23,340
That's a lot of money.

1310
02:37:23,340 --> 02:37:26,340
Thank you, Emmanuel Depressed for the 9 bucks.

1311
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:30,540
Jeremy, have you ever thought about doing streams with Kim?

1312
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:33,540
Because you're a cute couple and I think it would be fun.

1313
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:35,540
Only if she was okay with it and shit.

1314
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:40,059
Yeah, Kim pops in from time to time.

1315
02:37:40,059 --> 02:37:44,680
But Kim doesn't really like to be on camera.

1316
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:51,579
You know, she's not like a performer or like an entertainer.

1317
02:37:51,579 --> 02:37:54,579
So, she kind of doesn't really...

1318
02:37:54,579 --> 02:37:56,579
And that's not for everybody.

1319
02:37:56,579 --> 02:37:59,209
Sometimes she'll come in and just be like,

1320
02:37:59,209 --> 02:38:02,209
here's like Otto or here's this or...

1321
02:38:02,209 --> 02:38:12,030
But she has shown interest before in doing like a special one-off kind of stream.

1322
02:38:12,030 --> 02:38:16,170
Like a cooking thing or we hang out and do...

1323
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:18,170
We'll play like a card game or something.

1324
02:38:18,170 --> 02:38:28,139
So, I mean, there has been talk of that of what we would want to do if we did it.

1325
02:38:28,139 --> 02:38:35,260
She's been on streams before during a lot of my bullshit.

1326
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:39,420
Like the seed box thing.

1327
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:41,420
You know, that was...

1328
02:38:41,420 --> 02:38:44,200
She was there.

1329
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:46,200
She was on camera for that one.

1330
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:58,700
That was almost a whole year ago.

1331
02:38:58,700 --> 02:38:59,700
Yeah, time flies.

1332
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:00,700
It's ridiculous.

1333
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:08,770
But that's kind of the stance on that.

1334
02:39:08,770 --> 02:39:10,770
Maybe eventually.

1335
02:39:10,770 --> 02:39:11,770
But there's no...

1336
02:39:11,770 --> 02:39:16,770
There's no like pressure to have her be on camera or do anything.

1337
02:39:16,770 --> 02:39:20,770
You see her pop in from time to time, but not like full streams.

1338
02:39:20,770 --> 02:39:22,069
We'll see.

1339
02:39:26,379 --> 02:39:29,379
What a dumb fucking way to have you...

1340
02:39:29,379 --> 02:39:31,379
I'm not even gonna get into it.

1341
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:47,620
I don't know.

1342
02:39:47,620 --> 02:39:48,620
I'm not even gonna get into it.

1343
02:39:57,360 --> 02:40:01,659
You keep saying you need sticks throughout the entire game, but I've been here the whole time.

1344
02:40:01,659 --> 02:40:02,659
Yeah.

1345
02:40:02,659 --> 02:40:07,100
S-T-I-C-K-S, not S-T-Y-X.

1346
02:40:07,100 --> 02:40:08,100
Spelled differently.

1347
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:09,100
It's like there and there.

1348
02:40:09,100 --> 02:40:11,100
I need to go there.

1349
02:40:11,100 --> 02:40:13,100
Not like there as in T-H-E-I-R.

1350
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:14,100
There isn't there.

1351
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:15,100
That's bought over there.

1352
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:16,100
Sounds the same.

1353
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:17,100
English is weird.

1354
02:40:27,079 --> 02:40:29,079
I don't know why I said date.

1355
02:40:29,079 --> 02:40:31,379
This date is not what you said.

1356
02:40:31,379 --> 02:40:33,379
It's not in this message.

1357
02:40:33,379 --> 02:40:37,750
You said, can you go on another one of them hiatuses?

1358
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:41,250
I don't have much free time, and I've got a bunch of games I've been meaning to catch up on,

1359
02:40:41,250 --> 02:40:43,250
but you keep doing all these great streams.

1360
02:40:43,250 --> 02:40:47,250
And before you say it's a choice whether to watch it or not, it's a lifestyle.

1361
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:49,250
JermaJex.

1362
02:40:49,250 --> 02:41:00,590
Well, I mean, I kind of just have been streaming when I want to.

1363
02:41:00,590 --> 02:41:07,590
Streaming a lot, time-wise, to something I'm really into.

1364
02:41:07,590 --> 02:41:12,979
But recently, you know, I've been pulling him back a little bit.

1365
02:41:12,979 --> 02:41:15,569
I'm not going to be streaming.

1366
02:41:15,569 --> 02:41:20,569
I didn't stream for the last two yesterday, and I'm not streaming tomorrow or the next day.

1367
02:41:20,569 --> 02:41:24,569
I mean, sure, you're going to get Friday, Saturday, and Sunday loaded with content, by the way.

1368
02:41:24,569 --> 02:41:27,639
Two Kinect horror games.

1369
02:41:27,639 --> 02:41:30,879
The end of the Terraria saga.

1370
02:41:30,879 --> 02:41:36,510
And Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.

1371
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:40,879
I mean, it's loaded with content, but it'll take a couple days to get there.

1372
02:41:40,879 --> 02:41:46,379
Cox permitting, of course, right?

1373
02:41:46,379 --> 02:41:52,340
I know. Don't say that.

1374
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:54,829
It's been so good lately. Don't say that.

1375
02:41:54,829 --> 02:42:01,739
But yeah.

1376
02:42:01,739 --> 02:42:03,739
Thank you for the $5 air elicited.

1377
02:42:03,739 --> 02:42:10,979
The VODs will all be there for at least two months on Twitch with the chat.

1378
02:42:10,979 --> 02:42:16,979
And then there is that archive channel where they're just kind of there forever.

1379
02:42:16,979 --> 02:42:21,700
They have some time, but thank you.

1380
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:26,700
Thank you, smelly boy, for the phylactery lich did it again.

1381
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:31,379
But let me just first say to smelly boy.

1382
02:42:31,379 --> 02:42:33,379
Thank you for the 250.

1383
02:42:33,379 --> 02:42:35,379
When is Mario RPG stream Sunday?

1384
02:42:35,379 --> 02:42:36,379
I just said it.

1385
02:42:36,379 --> 02:42:38,379
I'm glad I got this message right here.

1386
02:42:38,379 --> 02:42:41,379
Thank you, smelly boy and phylactery lich.

1387
02:42:41,379 --> 02:42:44,149
Holy shit.

1388
02:42:44,149 --> 02:42:49,020
I mean, like that's this is next level.

1389
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:54,700
This is like four or five hundred subs that you have on the channel now.

1390
02:42:54,700 --> 02:42:57,700
Are you responsible for like at least three, four, five hundred people?

1391
02:42:57,700 --> 02:43:02,569
A couple of people have done this before.

1392
02:43:02,569 --> 02:43:04,569
And it's wild.

1393
02:43:04,569 --> 02:43:18,670
There's been at least a handful of people in this community that were responsible for at least two to five plus hundred subs on the channel.

1394
02:43:18,670 --> 02:43:22,700
But holy shit, phylactery.

1395
02:43:22,700 --> 02:43:29,020
Thank you for your mountain of subs that you just dropped here.

1396
02:43:29,020 --> 02:43:34,750
Again, only.

1397
02:43:34,750 --> 02:43:36,750
Only two hundred and thirty seven.

1398
02:43:36,750 --> 02:43:38,750
Only two hundred.

1399
02:43:38,750 --> 02:43:39,750
That's not that.

1400
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:47,750
That's not like a huge ridiculous fucking more than two almost two hundred and fifty fucking subscriptions on the channel attributed to one person.

1401
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:52,360
Thank you, phylactery.

1402
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:53,360
Seriously.

1403
02:43:53,360 --> 02:43:58,649
And congratulations to people that got those subs.

1404
02:43:58,649 --> 02:43:59,649
Thank you.

1405
02:43:59,649 --> 02:44:04,149
Appreciate it.

1406
02:44:04,149 --> 02:44:06,540
Getting down to the end.

1407
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:14,299
And I'm going to put on the credits and what a good opportunity to put them on now, considering that that sub drop just happened.

1408
02:44:14,299 --> 02:44:16,299
We still have some some bits to go through.

1409
02:44:16,299 --> 02:44:24,000
But as always, thanks everybody for joining me.

1410
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Hope you had fun.

1411
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,329
I'll see you guys all on Friday.

1412
02:44:28,329 --> 02:44:32,229
Much love to everybody.

1413
02:44:32,229 --> 02:44:33,229
Thank you for the subs.

1414
02:44:33,229 --> 02:44:34,229
Thank you for the support.

1415
02:44:34,229 --> 02:44:35,229
Thank you for everything.

1416
02:44:35,229 --> 02:44:37,729
All of you here listed.

1417
02:44:37,729 --> 02:44:51,260
You continue to be the oil that moves this engine forward.

1418
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:56,559
And there's going to be a big like oil explosion on that carnival stream.

1419
02:44:56,559 --> 02:45:11,180
Well, I mean, there's going to be like a there's going to be a all of the support from everybody will be on that stream.

1420
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:12,180
I worded that weirdly.

1421
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:19,290
No, not like oil spill.

1422
02:45:19,290 --> 02:45:20,290
Not like no, no, no, no, no.

1423
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:22,290
I'm talking about like you guys.

1424
02:45:22,290 --> 02:45:24,290
Look, I'm fucking stupid.

1425
02:45:24,290 --> 02:45:43,639
Just call me a pee pants and we'll get over it.

1426
02:45:43,639 --> 02:45:50,829
No, that that stream should be so much fun.

1427
02:45:50,829 --> 02:45:52,829
I really can't wait for you guys to see it.

1428
02:45:52,829 --> 02:45:59,079
I have another kind of update meeting.

1429
02:45:59,079 --> 02:46:00,079
I've actually heard.

1430
02:46:00,079 --> 02:46:02,079
I mean, why did I tell you?

1431
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:07,450
This is I mean, what am I going to I'm not going to talk about this stream anymore.

1432
02:46:07,450 --> 02:46:12,450
Oh, there are more than there are more than a few robots.

1433
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:16,879
And one of them has just been completed from what I've been told.

1434
02:46:16,879 --> 02:46:20,879
So one of them is like kind of almost ready to go completely.

1435
02:46:20,879 --> 02:46:30,110
And apparently they apparently said it's a lot of fun and it's pretty crazy.

1436
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:32,930
So that's a little update for you.

1437
02:46:32,930 --> 02:46:40,500
And over the next couple of days, I'm going to figure out some more stuff, get some more details.

1438
02:46:40,500 --> 02:46:45,680
What the hell is even going to happen?

1439
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,680
I would just hang out and show up on the 21st.

1440
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:49,680
That's all you need to know.

1441
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:52,500
Who is they?

1442
02:46:52,500 --> 02:46:58,500
That is the robotics company that is engineering and making the robots and the production company team

1443
02:46:58,500 --> 02:47:02,500
that is responsible for a lot of the on-site stuff as well.

1444
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:04,500
And this is this sub.

1445
02:47:04,500 --> 02:47:05,500
This is still going.

1446
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:06,500
There's a lot of people.

1447
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:11,639
Thank you guys.

1448
02:47:11,639 --> 02:47:15,389
Also, thank you to S10W update for the 250.

1449
02:47:15,389 --> 02:47:19,389
Hey, Jerma, I know you told me that I don't need to donate if it's too expensive, but no matter what,

1450
02:47:19,389 --> 02:47:22,389
I will support even with one dollar in my pocket.

1451
02:47:22,389 --> 02:47:26,629
Hope you have a great night and I hope to donate lots more.

1452
02:47:26,629 --> 02:47:30,940
And they say war and hate war and hate.

1453
02:47:32,559 --> 02:47:35,559
P.S. Why did you leak every football player's phone number and home address?

1454
02:47:35,559 --> 02:47:43,489
I didn't want to donate lots more war and hate.

1455
02:47:43,489 --> 02:47:57,100
How about safety and fucking happiness?

1456
02:47:57,100 --> 02:48:01,639
How about like mac and cheese?

1457
02:48:01,639 --> 02:48:07,940
How about pistachios?

1458
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:10,940
Not in the ice cream, but flavored ice cream.

1459
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:14,500
Don't like the pistachio in the ice cream.

1460
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:16,500
I like the pistachio flavoring in the ice cream.

1461
02:48:16,500 --> 02:48:18,500
Don't give me pistachios in there.

1462
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:23,530
I just want the taste of the pistachio ice cream.

1463
02:48:23,530 --> 02:48:25,469
God.

1464
02:48:25,469 --> 02:48:26,469
But thank you.

1465
02:48:26,469 --> 02:48:30,780
S10W update.

1466
02:48:30,780 --> 02:48:35,979
I really hope that you would keep your last off though, because it's yours.

1467
02:48:35,979 --> 02:48:38,379
But I do appreciate it.

1468
02:48:38,379 --> 02:48:40,129
Thank you.

1469
02:48:40,129 --> 02:48:42,559
We also had...

1470
02:48:42,559 --> 02:48:43,559
Where, where, where, where, where?

1471
02:48:43,559 --> 02:48:44,559
We're almost at the end here.

1472
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:47,559
Schworzard.

1473
02:48:47,559 --> 02:48:48,559
Schworzard.

1474
02:48:48,559 --> 02:48:49,559
Thanks Schworzard Ed.

1475
02:48:49,559 --> 02:48:50,559
Thanks for the five dollars.

1476
02:48:50,559 --> 02:48:55,340
Please read out the story that I got.

1477
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:57,340
Read out the story that you got?

1478
02:48:57,340 --> 02:49:00,049
Oh, from Tonk to Transformer?

1479
02:49:00,049 --> 02:49:01,049
Well, it's loading.

1480
02:49:01,049 --> 02:49:02,049
Let me see.

1481
02:49:02,049 --> 02:49:03,049
Errorless.

1482
02:49:03,049 --> 02:49:04,049
Thanks for the 250.

1483
02:49:04,049 --> 02:49:05,049
Can't wait for the streams this weekend.

1484
02:49:05,049 --> 02:49:06,049
Connect Horror, Sturma, and Mario RPG.

1485
02:49:06,049 --> 02:49:07,049
Those will be fun.

1486
02:49:07,049 --> 02:49:14,100
It will very much be interesting, I think.

1487
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:16,100
Thank you to Dr. Steen for the five dollars.

1488
02:49:16,100 --> 02:49:18,100
Leave your next deli sandwich in the car.

1489
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:22,100
I still have flashbacks of doing that.

1490
02:49:22,100 --> 02:49:28,629
I am so mad about that.

1491
02:49:28,629 --> 02:49:31,629
That was from a really good deli that was around me.

1492
02:49:31,629 --> 02:49:33,809
That place was awesome.

1493
02:49:33,809 --> 02:49:37,010
It was like a little sandwich shop and they did a sandwich.

1494
02:49:37,010 --> 02:49:38,010
I can't even say it.

1495
02:49:38,010 --> 02:49:40,010
I'm not even going to think about it anymore.

1496
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:42,010
But thank you Dr. Steen for the five dollars.

1497
02:49:42,010 --> 02:49:44,010
Thank you BDLujay for the five dollars.

1498
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:46,010
I actually pronounced Blujay.

1499
02:49:46,010 --> 02:49:47,010
Oh, sorry.

1500
02:49:47,010 --> 02:49:48,010
Thank you Blujay.

1501
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:52,010
They say, Hey Jerma, my brothers introduced me to you a long time ago, but I only just

1502
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:56,010
started watching some second Jerma highlights and they brought me a lot of laughs and really

1503
02:49:56,010 --> 02:49:58,010
cheered me up after long days at work.

1504
02:49:58,010 --> 02:50:01,010
This has been the first stream that I've gotten to sit and really enjoy.

1505
02:50:01,010 --> 02:50:05,010
It was so good to cry laughing at the 8 a.m. Eastern bit.

1506
02:50:05,010 --> 02:50:08,010
Thanks for being a cool and funny, genuine guy.

1507
02:50:08,010 --> 02:50:11,340
Incredibly nice message.

1508
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:12,340
I'm glad that you're here.

1509
02:50:12,340 --> 02:50:14,340
Glad you're hanging out.

1510
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:18,409
Thanks to your brothers for introducing you.

1511
02:50:18,409 --> 02:50:19,409
I'm just me.

1512
02:50:19,409 --> 02:50:21,409
I don't know who else to be.

1513
02:50:21,409 --> 02:50:24,420
I'm happy that you find it interesting.

1514
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:27,870
Thank you and welcome.

1515
02:50:27,870 --> 02:50:31,100
Right?

1516
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:34,959
Welcome.

1517
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:43,579
Also, we had those subs from Phylactery and that's the end.

1518
02:50:43,579 --> 02:50:44,579
I will.

1519
02:50:44,579 --> 02:50:45,579
I will.

1520
02:50:45,579 --> 02:50:52,260
I was skimmed through this talk to transformer that was posted here from Schwarz Ed.

1521
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:56,260
I just had a horrible burrito at Taco Bell and I hate it.

1522
02:50:56,260 --> 02:50:58,260
I'm not a vegetarian, but I hate my burrito.

1523
02:50:58,260 --> 02:51:02,260
I've seen my dad eat the same burrito, which was incidentally very decent, but this burrito

1524
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:03,260
was awful.

1525
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,260
This was an incredibly disappointing burrito.

1526
02:51:05,260 --> 02:51:09,260
The burrito was very fatty, very dry, very greasy, but that would be my main complaint

1527
02:51:09,260 --> 02:51:11,260
if it was just a burrito.

1528
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:15,260
The taste was all kind of bland, to be honest, and the portions were actually pretty small.

1529
02:51:15,260 --> 02:51:18,260
The guacamole was good, but to be fair, I didn't order the guac because I was in a rush

1530
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:20,260
and the guac is not a burrito.

1531
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:22,260
And there are some things you can't have in a burrito.

1532
02:51:22,260 --> 02:51:25,260
You can't have cilantro, onion, and cheese.

1533
02:51:25,260 --> 02:51:27,260
And cilantro is a bit of too much.

1534
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:30,260
The beef was good, but so was the avocado.

1535
02:51:30,260 --> 02:51:34,260
However, the tortilla is so soft that I could eat the tortilla without breaking it.

1536
02:51:34,260 --> 02:51:38,680
At the same time, the...

1537
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:39,680
Thank you for that.

1538
02:51:39,680 --> 02:51:43,260
I'll see you guys on Friday.

1539
02:51:43,260 --> 02:51:47,020
Thanks for watching the APE game.

1540
02:51:47,020 --> 02:51:50,020
And of course, talk to Transformers is always fun.

1541
02:51:50,020 --> 02:51:55,770
And Tingy just dropped 10 community subs right now, right before the stream turned off.

1542
02:51:55,770 --> 02:51:58,770
And S10W update gave 250.

1543
02:51:58,770 --> 02:52:00,770
And Dr. Steen gave $5.

1544
02:52:00,770 --> 02:52:01,770
Right now.

1545
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:03,770
We all just came in right now.

1546
02:52:03,770 --> 02:52:09,340
Dr. Steen says, what's the cutoff point?

1547
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:13,340
For hours, a sandwich can be left in the car where you'll still eat it.

1548
02:52:13,340 --> 02:52:15,770
Uh, an hour.

1549
02:52:15,770 --> 02:52:18,329
No, depends on where.

1550
02:52:18,329 --> 02:52:22,620
45 minutes, maybe. 30 minutes.

1551
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:24,920
Depends on where I am.

1552
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:25,920
How hot is the car.

1553
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:26,920
If the car is...

1554
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:28,920
If we're here, talking about Vegas.

1555
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:30,920
105 degrees out pretty much every day.

1556
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:32,920
102, 105.

1557
02:52:32,920 --> 02:52:34,920
Uh, 10 minutes.

1558
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:35,920
15 minutes.

1559
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,920
Before that sandwich is destroyed.

1560
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:44,739
If the car is negative 10 Celsius.

1561
02:52:44,739 --> 02:52:45,920
A few days.

1562
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:47,799
Five, 10 days.

1563
02:52:47,799 --> 02:52:49,799
Put it in the microwave.

1564
02:52:49,799 --> 02:52:56,610
What the fuck? What do you mean?

1565
02:52:56,610 --> 02:52:57,610
Negative 10 Celsius?

1566
02:52:57,610 --> 02:52:59,610
That's like, that's freezing.

1567
02:52:59,610 --> 02:53:01,909
You can keep shit in the freezer for months.

1568
02:53:01,909 --> 02:53:03,909
I think it'll be okay frozen in the car.

1569
02:53:03,909 --> 02:53:09,219
But thank you, Dr. Steen.

1570
02:53:09,219 --> 02:53:10,219
And then S10W update.

1571
02:53:10,219 --> 02:53:11,219
Sorry about that, Jerma.

1572
02:53:11,219 --> 02:53:12,219
That was my evil clone.

1573
02:53:12,219 --> 02:53:13,219
S...

1574
02:53:13,219 --> 02:53:14,219
Slow update.

1575
02:53:14,219 --> 02:53:15,219
Peace and love.

1576
02:53:15,219 --> 02:53:18,829
Slow update.

1577
02:53:18,829 --> 02:53:19,829
Right.

1578
02:53:19,829 --> 02:53:20,829
I think you've...

1579
02:53:20,829 --> 02:53:22,829
It's not S10W update.

1580
02:53:22,829 --> 02:53:25,459
But I keep saying that.

1581
02:53:25,459 --> 02:53:26,459
Right.

1582
02:53:26,459 --> 02:53:27,459
Uh, thank you though.

1583
02:53:27,459 --> 02:53:28,459
Appreciate it.

1584
02:53:28,459 --> 02:53:31,360
Minus 10 is freezer temperature.

1585
02:53:31,360 --> 02:53:32,360
Yeah.

1586
02:53:32,360 --> 02:53:34,360
That's what I was thinking.

1587
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:38,670
Alright.

1588
02:53:38,670 --> 02:53:39,670
Good night, guys.

1589
02:53:39,670 --> 02:53:44,670
I'll see you Friday for more Connect, Horror Movie Connect, Horror Show Connect.

1590
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:48,149
Take care, guys.

1591
02:53:48,149 --> 02:53:49,149
See you soon.
