1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,260
Hold on, so you're telling me that I have to use dive and or kick to be able to navigate the menu. I can't hit up or down.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,260
No, there is no up, there is no down. There is only dive and there is only kick.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,309
This is so dumb.

4
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,309
It's pretty hard at first. I think I'm used to it now.

5
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:36,310
Where's my, like, can I change the settings?

6
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:43,310
Yeah, you have to hit them both at the same time to select something or hold the one button to go back.

7
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,310
What? Why? Why is this?

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,320
I don't know, are you not good enough to play this?

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Dude, I can't even navigate the fucking menu.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:05,200
I like the, okay, can we have a best out of three? This is winner takes all. The loser has to buy the winner new curtains.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Okay, new curtains?

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
New curtains.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,879
That sounds like a plan to me. Let's go. I can't wait to get the new curtains in the mail.

14
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,879
You didn't even kick me.

15
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,180
He doesn't, he doesn't have to kick you.

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
He doesn't, what do you mean? This is dive, kick. This is not electrocute move, kick.

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,180
But it's still pretty much a dive, kick.

18
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,180
Okay, all right, whatever. I'm getting those curtains.

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,390
Are you really going to get the curtains?

20
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,390
Yeah, I am.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,390
You want these curtains?

22
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,390
I'm getting the curtains. I'm getting all kinds of, uh.

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:51,159
Is that all you got?

24
00:01:51,159 --> 00:02:03,959
Those fucking curtains of mine.

25
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
You're going down.

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,959
I picked like the slowest character in the world.

27
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:08,960
He's really good.

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
No, he's slow.

29
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
You can flip him over to change the type of his kick.

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Yeah, cool.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:21,870
It's good.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,870
I can't get frauded out right here.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,219
Yes.

34
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,909
I hate that character so much. Who would ever play that character?

35
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:34,150
Me.

36
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,979
Oh, nice.

37
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:39,979
Okay, okay.

38
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:43,539
Slowly coming back here. I want those curtains.

39
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:47,539
No, see, when curtains are on the line, you don't even stand a chance.

40
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,800
Really? Really?

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,360
Kurt, I thought it was who's higher.

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Who's higher? No.

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
I was higher than you.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
My foot hitbox was in your body. There's a difference.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I punched your foot.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
You didn't punch my foot. I punched your kneecap foot ankle.

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,860
Idiot.

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
Here we go. No holds barred.

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,659
Fight.

50
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,659
Fight.

51
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,110
Oh, die of a kick.

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,949
Yeah, about those curtains.

53
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,949
I want insulated honeycomb.

54
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,949
I got some really nice ones.

55
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:34,300
It ain't over yet.

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Is he cheating?

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,659
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,270
Oh, my God.

60
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,270
My control is broken.

61
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,509
That's the only reason why it just broke.

62
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,509
I believe you. I believe you completely.

63
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,509
My control, the buttons are all broken on it.

64
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,509
I'm lucky to be even playing right now.

65
00:03:55,509 --> 00:04:00,949
Your little moves there.

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,389
Yeah, good job getting lucky, nerd.

67
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,389
Take that to the bank and cash it.

68
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,389
And make sure to cash this one too.

69
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,389
Make sure to cash this one too.

70
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:17,699
Oh, he's getting in his head a little bit here.

71
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,139
Oh, you see me grabbing my head.

72
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:23,139
He's getting in his head a little bit here.

73
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,740
That's okay. That's okay now that I'm not concussioned.

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:38,639
Oh, take that to the kneecap and all the way back.

75
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,639
Hey, don't worry.

76
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,639
He's getting in his head a little bit.

77
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,639
Hey, what's this?

78
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,670
What's this? You want me to go like super kick mode?

79
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,670
What? It didn't activate on you.

80
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,670
You were like right there.

81
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,670
You cheated. You basically cheated.

82
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,670
That's one to one.

83
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,670
That's one to one right there.

84
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,670
It's eight to eight.

85
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,670
You know, let me tell you.

86
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,670
The drapes on my walls could really go good with light blue curtains.

87
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,670
Probably satin.

88
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,670
It could look really, really good.

89
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,170
You don't know what else would look really good?

90
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,170
Yeah, what?

91
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,170
Your blood on my walls.

92
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,170
All right, let's see it.

93
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,170
This is the game.

94
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:18,490
This is the deciding game.

95
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Damn it.

96
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,490
That wasn't your head either?

97
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,240
Okay, it's like you don't even have one.

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,310
Round two, dive kick.

99
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,449
Here we go.

100
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,449
Stupid ass character.

101
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:32,449
Kick you right in the stomach.

102
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,259
Get that out of here.

103
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,259
What? It locks on to you?

104
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,259
I didn't know it locked on to you.

105
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,259
It locks on to you.

106
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,259
Oh, my God.

107
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:56,019
All right, let's make this quick.

108
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,470
Wow, okay.

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,470
Somebody got baited.

110
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,470
Somebody got baited.

111
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,620
My God, no.

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,430
Come on, fill it up.

113
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,670
Oh, here we go.

114
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:18,060
Well, I've got to start picking out some curtains for Jerma.

115
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Hit him.

116
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,089
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,089
You seriously act like you know what was happening.

118
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:36,399
Where are those curtains?

119
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,399
Here's my chance.

120
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,399
Here's my chance.

121
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,399
I need one more.

122
00:06:40,399 --> 00:07:01,300
Get him.

123
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
You know what's best out of five, right?

124
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,220
You heard about that?

125
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Did you hear about that?

126
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Like it was on the news last night.

127
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
I was watching the news and it was like best out of five.

128
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
It was like what?

129
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
No way.

130
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,220
It was crazy.

131
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,220
Like everyone was tweeting about it.

132
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
It was trending.
