1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:16,559
Let me just put my new copy down. I might sound different too, I might have to change some settings because I had to clean every nozzle, every knob, every single one needed to be cleaned.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:50,560
Hold on. Let me see, how's that? Is that bad? Good? Worse? Better? Hold on. I mean, we're muted now, but how about now? Can you hear me? How do I sound? Sound okay? Okay.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, let me go over why we're starting like an hour and 20 minutes late. Because I dumped an entire 16 ounces of coffee on my desk and all like into my computer and shit.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,140
My computer is underneath my desk to the left. I have a big L shaped desk. It's a beautiful desk. The thing is absolutely wonderful. It's walnut wood.

5
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:36,079
And I fucking did the thing I promised myself I would never do. And that's dump. And I didn't even take one sip out of it either. I came up here to get ready to stream like, okay, I'm ready to start hit the button to start streaming. Here we go. Like it's time. And I dumped the whole fucking thing.

6
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:45,579
I tried to put it down on the coaster and it just like, and I it's because my hands were a little wet. And those of you guys that don't let me tell you something about glass. Okay.

7
00:01:45,579 --> 00:02:06,909
Don't fucking use glass. Don't drink out of glass. It's not worth it. If you get even if you could even like one drop of water on your hands, when you grab onto glass, it's it makes the glass 1000 times more slippery.

8
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:17,870
I don't know why we put liquid in these things. Glasses superpower is getting really hard to hold on to when it's wet.

9
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:42,610
You ceramic or metal drink out of 10. I'm getting a 10 cup. It's gonna be I'm gonna get a sippy cup. Everyone thinks that that's a joke. No, no, I'm going to get a I'm gonna buy on Amazon. I'm gonna go buy like a child six pack of sippy cups and just have them ready every anytime.

10
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:59,909
Because this was fucking horrible. I I didn't even react right away because I was gonna cry. I just like dumped it. It was like this. This is a brand new desk and like a new place and not even fucking two months and I dump a fucking full 16 ounces of coffee over

11
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:27,569
my computer on the bike, my my XLR input, my stream deck, my monitor, my fucking controller, my phone, my computer. It was awful. It was horrible. And I almost cried. But we can hold on to those tears now because we're going to do something today. Stop drinking coffee. How do you stop doing something? Yeah, I can't just stop drinking coffee coffees like my whole life.

12
00:03:27,569 --> 00:04:07,099
Two servings of coffee. It was supposed to last. It was supposed to last me like an hour and a half. Hey, just don't do that. No. All right. I just had to vent. I had to vent to you guys. So let's get started. Today what's going to happen is something different. And this I'll give you a quick story of how this came about. I was going to play Super Smash Brothers today. The World of Light. I guess I'm addicted to it. Oh, I just just stopped playing World of Light. Just stop doing that. I'm addicted to the World of Light. It's it's very fun.

13
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:38,420
It's really interesting. And I talked about it in the pre stream chat. I was kind of hanging out here. I'm like, oh, yeah, guys, I got an idea. I'm going to play World of Light Smash Brothers. And like, when you say that, that's like, no, it was just like, no, that's like, don't do that. But like, I want to do it. And I probably am. So and somebody mentioned just play Nickelodeon Flash games. And I said, I don't know, maybe you guys want to play like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network Flash games.

14
00:04:38,420 --> 00:05:15,420
One guy said it. That actually was two guys. And I said, all right, fine, because I want to prove to you guys without even a reasonable doubt that one day you will be the one guy. Everyone thinks that's just like a joke. Now I'm playing Nickelodeon Flash games. And not only that, you guys are going to get to pick which ones I have the extension turned on. That makes it so it shows a percentage of where everyone is clicking on the screen. This is going to be a mess. So it's your guys job to browse.

15
00:05:16,910 --> 00:06:12,970
I'm you can control me. I'm going to go with the highest percentages. You want to test it now. Let's test it. How does it work? All right. Well, it looks like it looks like it's working. Everyone people clicking on the moon. All right. Wow. You guys are really, really coordinated. You're going 87 74% on the moon, huh? Oh, almost had almost had it. 32%, 31%. Holy shit. There's a lot of clicks. Okay, I'm gonna have to like, I'm gonna have to make the clicks. Only one click per person until I stop.

16
00:06:13,009 --> 00:07:00,220
All right. That's enough of that. How do I get this off the screen? Okay, there we go. Also, I need to, uh, I think let me see if I can make this. Yeah, I can. Let's make it. How does that sound? All right, we're gonna try this again. I want to do one more test. Please everybody. If 100% of you guys don't click the moon, the stream is going to end. It needs to be 100%. 100% or the stream ends. I think you guys broke it. What's with the weird half circle there on the bottom?

17
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:44,180
Make sure this is gone. Yeah, it's on there, right? What are you guys even clicking on down there? That was 100% for it. People are clicking on the extension button. Oh, they're clicking on the moon. But that's not a moon though. Okay. Well, it works. I'm gonna regret this. Oh, fuck Jesus. Hold on. Okay. So, oh, yeah. Yeah. Where do we start here? Okay, you guys, I'll show you. I'll show you.

18
00:07:44,180 --> 00:08:24,139
We'll see where we're gonna start. Let's turn that off. Let's pull this up. Well, it looks like we're already on this one. But hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. There are other options here. Let me just go like this real quick. Okay. I gotta, like, put the tabs on here. Okay. So, here are the tabs. If you guys could go ahead and see where right now we're on. This is Cartoon Network. We have, I'll just go through them all. Here's Nickelodeon. Here is Wild Tangent. Nickelodeon Cartoon Network Mini Clip in Armor Games. Uh, could you guys go ahead and tell

19
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:42,080
me which tab you'd like me to start on, please? Why are people starting over here? This is

20
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,710
not part of the options. I can't click that. Okay. We got, most of you guys are over

21
00:08:50,710 --> 00:09:09,820
at Armor, but click the ad. Click the X. No. Turn, click the ad. I have to, I can't click

22
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:47,200
that far left. God damn it. Hold on. I don't want to click the Pokemon ad. No, no. This

23
00:09:47,200 --> 00:10:07,340
is not what we're doing. This is, this is not part of the plan here, guys. Oh my God.

24
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:17,340
This was not part of this. I'm sorry. He's going to have to buy some shit. Oh, I gave

differ. Okay. Well, Twitch plays web browser. Continue. Oh, come on. You guys

31
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:32,730
are supposed to pick a flash game, not make me buy Pokemon. Let's go Eevee. I

32
00:11:32,730 --> 00:12:02,220
just need to make sure it doesn't like show like anything bad. Is this a real

33
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:25,820
website? If I click it on the socks. I don't know. Okay. Hold on. I might need

34
00:12:25,820 --> 00:13:06,500
to restart this. I'm really going to make me buy these 75% add to cart.

Wait, hold on. All right. I add, I did it. I added to cart. Are you happy? Why is it

Restart. Okay. Which buys socks? Nope. Is anybody else voting on this? People

38
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:22,210

This isn't flash games. Yeah, let me just check out with PayPal. That

42
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:21,419

43
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:45,830
shipping? No, we don't need free shipping. Well, all right. 47% want me

44
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,309
to click here. I can click here. That doesn't mean I have to press a

45
00:15:49,429 --> 00:16:03,320
number, guys. It has to be plus one. Well, if I click it, that would mean one, right?

46
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:24,340
Okay. All right. There you go. Okay. Everybody relax for a second. There's

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,019
let me get the free shipping. You're gonna make me check out right now

52
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:28,059
without free shipping. You guys gonna make me suffer? Wow. I can't believe it. I

53
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:57,740
can't believe you guys are gonna make me do this. Okay. There are 30,000

54
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,529
clicks here, by the way. I think I'm gonna call it at 30,000 clicks on

55
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:14,119
each one. But oh, oh my god. How the fuck are you guys gonna be able to do

56
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:25,259
this? Is there even a possible way for you to do that? I gotta reset the

57
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:33,579
clicks here. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. I gotta reset the clicks. Okay. Hold on. Hold on a

58
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:41,759
second. And, and by the way, now I'm including a one click. One click per

59
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:50,650
person. So make sure it counts. You want to make sure this counts. One click

60
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,920
per viewer. You understand? Hold on. I'll make it easy for you. Hold on. I

61
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:08,740
gotta get in close. That's not working. I gotta go even closer than

62
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:18,950
this. I think that's it. Hold on. Maybe a little bit more. That's gonna be so

63
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:32,200
hard. Okay. Here we go. Don't start yet. Actually, it actually is pretty accurate.

64
00:19:32,200 --> 00:20:00,839
Oh, not anymore. Make sure you're accurate. Over, over 15 inches. Costumes. Over, uh, how

65
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:15,880
many we got? We had 1,700 participants. Over 15 inches. All right.

66
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:23,839
That, that's the, oh Jesus Christ. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta

67
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:36,789
restart it again. What am I even gonna fucking do with this? No, that's

68
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:50,119
too far. There we go. Okay. Restart it. Some of these are like 40 bucks. All

69
00:20:50,119 --> 00:21:04,000
right. Hold on. Here we go. We got Pikachu in the running. We got Mr.

70
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,400
Krabs. Uh, it seems to be split between Gardevoir and then, but, but this whale.

71
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:26,039
This is 26 inches. You motherfuckers down there trying to, trying to make me

72
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:31,480
spend $250 on fucking Pikachu. That thing is, is big as the, I don't know

73
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,750
what I could do with that. Everyone has voted so far. It's a good thing

74
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:49,970
you weren't looking at the prices, guys. All right. It looks like it's gonna be a

75
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:57,400
whale lord by an incredibly large margin. Reset? It's not my fault that you

76
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,779
guys weren't paying attention to what the fuck you were clicking on. Are you

77
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:09,769
serious? You, you could have looked at the prices. This is on you guys. All

78
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,839
right. Let's get whale lord, okay? Let's make, I don't know, I don't know

79
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:51,119
what to do here. Reset, please. I'm not gonna reset it. Customer reviews. What

80
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,319
could you possibly review? It's big, it's blue, and, uh, my son sits on it when he

81
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:14,509
plays Fortnite. Back button. No, it's not where people are clicking. Now we're

82
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,069
doing one per customer here, one per user. When we get to about 1,800 to

83
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:25,430
2,000 is clicks. And by the way, if you want to participate, if you don't know

84
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:28,539
what's going on, all you got to do is click the screen. You just got to

85
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:33,339
activate the button there and then click the screen anywhere you want. This is,

86
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:40,119
this is Twitch, uh, plays flash games or chooses what flash games I play, but

87
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,940
I forgot that I told them they have absolute power and they decided that

88
00:23:43,940 --> 00:24:20,930
they were, they weren't gonna do it. So, back, back. Well, looks like you

89
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:31,019
want me to, uh, check it out. Go to cart. We're almost at, we're at 1,500. I don't

90
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,940
think it's, it's kind of an, I don't think it's possible to come back from

91
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:47,480
that. Turn off ad block. I, I can't, I can't just click ads. This is my, my

92
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,400
computer, I don't want to get a fucking computer ad virus. I don't want to

93
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:09,000
get like adware. All right, we hit the 1,700. There we are. Okay, we're

94
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:22,529
gonna restart. My order now qualifies for free shipping. Here we go. No, no,

95
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:41,480
do not even fucking dare. People are still going up here. All right, I, can I

96
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:57,240
finally get off this ride? We're at 1,800. I don't think it's possible. I

97
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:12,200
think it's checking out is what I'm gonna do. Yeah, that's it. I am about

98
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:30,559
to purchase two pairs of Pikachu socks in a, in a Werelord plush. This is

99
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,849
our Christmas gift to you. All right, all right, all right, all right. Let me,

100
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:46,039
let me just hold on a second. I need to like, okay, I got that. I will prove, I

101
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:52,309
will prove that I, I will prove that I bought those. I'm gonna be wearing the

102
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,109
socks on stream and I'm gonna, the, the whale's just gonna be back here

103
00:26:55,109 --> 00:27:09,480
behind me. Okay, so let me go back to where I was. We originally chose, we

104
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:21,220
were, we were originally here. Okay, welcome back everybody. Let's get this

105
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:33,240
back on the screen. Welcome back. So I need you guys to pick the, at the top,

106
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,019
the tabs where you'd like to go. We've got wild tangent. We've got,

107
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:02,369
I can't watch cartoons on this stream. Do you understand? This is the

108
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:28,769
quickest way for my channel to get banned. What are you even clicking on?

109
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,680
I scroll, scroll up. No, this was, this was supposed to be like here, guys.

110
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:01,160
Cheater. No, everyone wants me to click the Amazon link and that's gonna go

111
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,970
into my Amazon account and then we're on a fucking shopping website.

112
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:28,240
No, I'm not gonna spend like five grand on this stream. Get him to

113
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Amazon. Oh my fucking god. Just hold on a second. Let me make sure this is

114
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,279
not gonna, yes, I'm sure I'm, wait, hold on, not sure. I'm not so sure.

115
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:50,079
I'm not so sure about this. I'm not in control here. Oh, I'm not in

116
00:29:50,079 --> 00:30:09,119
control here. All right. I'm not going to Amazon. I don't want to go to

117
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:27,779
fucking Amazon, guys. No, we're going where we're supposed to go. I want to

118
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:36,599
go to Disneyland, go to Reddit. I mean, I could go to Reddit. That

119
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:40,279
would actually be kind of funny. That would be really, really interesting

120
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:54,980
actually. We could probably do something pretty fun. No, I'm not

121
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:13,319
gonna go to like porn. That's not gonna happen, guys. Cool math

122
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:21,970
games. All right. Let's go, let me go back to where we were

123
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:40,710
supposed to be, which is here. This is our stream now. I'm not clicking

124
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:55,430
another ad. Fuck me. No, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna pick,

125
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:01,539
I'm gonna stop this and I'm gonna go here. I'm gonna make it so you guys

126
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:07,089
can't click on anything else. You know what I mean? Here's how this is

127
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:23,269
gonna work. Watch this. You ready for this? Yeah, try to

128
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:29,990
deal with this. Huh? Now you have to click somewhere up here.

129
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:52,880
Good luck. Yeah, good luck to you. No. Oh my fucking god.

130
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:04,359
Oh, that doesn't mean I have to click there.

131
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:13,920
I'm gonna play a flash game like I was supposed to do an hour ago.

132
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,880
Okay, it looks like six percent. Oh my god. No, no.

133
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:27,299
I'm, what? Pick from here. Here. Here is a better idea.

134
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:39,349
Oh shit. Whoops. It's like all stretched.

135
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:50,259
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now you should be able to see

136
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:55,759
everything on screen. Hey, look. There you go. All right. You're gonna pick

137
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:03,700
from, you pick your favorite show, okay? Pick your favorite show in a

138
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,639
second. I'm gonna get it nice and close.

139
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:17,170
I can't believe I'm buying fucking socks. So I gotta get a little closer

140
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:26,849
though. Like that. Okay, good luck. Let's actually do this for the

141
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:40,920
for the first time in about like fucking 30 or 40 minutes.

142
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,559
Oh man, this is close. I don't know which one that is.

143
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:56,719
Is it six? Oh, that's all in the same circle though.

144
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:09,960
And oh, it's Courage is currently winning. Okay, I think it's gonna be

145
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,469
Courage. Need to zoom. All right, we're gonna zoom in closer here though

146
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:35,460
because that's correct. Do it again. Go for it. Courage.

147
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:47,349
It's Courage! The Cowardly Dog with Courage! The Cowardly Dog Show!

148
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:52,920
You guys didn't even know Snoopy was on this list. What are you, crazy?

149
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,320
All right, it's Courage! The Cowardly Dog with this 2,000 clicks.

150
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:08,340
I need to get this back to like normal. All right, Courage! The Cowardly Dog.

151
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,820
But what Courage! The Cowardly Dog? I'm not clicking that, okay?

152
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:20,420
So I'm sorry. I'm not gonna click the ad. It's already over.

153
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:42,769
I'm not clicking on it. You're not going back to fucking the Pokemon store.

154
00:36:42,769 --> 00:37:08,199
Why does it only have one game? Yeah, why?

155
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:38,599
Okay, okay. Fun. I told you guys you were gonna have power and

156
00:37:38,599 --> 00:38:19,800
I can't take it away from you now. We did this already!

157
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:48,150
I'm turning adblock on after this. You're gonna end up living under a bridge with

158
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:57,800
nothing but Pikachu socks. All right, let's hold on, hold on,

159
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,699
hold on. Refresh it. Wow! There's a fight going on here

160
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:17,110
actually. I'm very surprised by this. I might have to enhance. Yeah, I'm

161
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,510
gonna, I'm gonna, we're gonna redo, stop. I gotta redo this. I gotta, I have

162
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:40,039
to go in and enhance this. This is too close. Holy shit!

163
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:50,440
Wow! This is unbelievable! It's, I have to enhance it again.

164
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,949
That's too, I have to do, we have to go closer. We have to go even deeper.

165
00:39:56,949 --> 00:40:18,480
I can't even go that deep. It won't even let me.

166
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,219
This is fucking ridiculous. I can't, why does some of you guys want me to

167
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:57,510
click in the middle? Well, it looks like democracy has won.

168
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:13,559
Yeah, democracy has won. I'm clicking cancel. Let me just back it up for a

169
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:28,719
second here though. Hold on. Cancel. Wow! That's kind of

170
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:58,769
unbelievable, guys. Unbelievable. Watch the latest video.

171
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:20,710
What happens when I click this though? Am I gonna get, like, an ad?

172
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,510
Oh!

173
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:30,079
It's only halfway done. Holy shit, the subs.

174
00:43:30,079 --> 00:44:02,530
Okay. All right, that was fucking fun. Okay, it's time to,

175
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:23,480
darn, this is why, fuck, I just, fucking, this ad is a full minute.

176
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:36,519
Oh, what the fuck? I, what? Okay, here's,

177
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:45,159
uh, first of all, hold on. Somebody gave a bunch of subs.

178
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:48,760
Update your flash. I don't need to. I got the latest version. Don't worry.

179
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,679
Now, let me get the, okay, listen. This is, everyone, this is what you guys

180
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,679
picked. You picked Courage the Cowardly Dog

181
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:04,420
from Courage the Cowardly Dog Show. This is what everybody clicked on.

182
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,489
I'm making sure that you can't click anything else if you want. Okay, here we

183
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:15,800
go. Courage the Cowardly Dog Nightmare Vacation.

184
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,880
Evil lava creatures have trapped, uh, Muriel under an island volcano. Help

185
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:31,670
Courage rescue her. Okay.

186
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:50,659
Bear skeeble. Arrow keys in space. This is so loud. What? This feels like an

187
00:45:50,659 --> 00:46:08,440
unfinished grid. How do I, why is this game still on

188
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,840
their website? This game probably has, they probably

189
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:50,440
forgot it existed. People saying go down.

190
00:46:50,440 --> 00:47:05,800
Oh, I wonder. Okay, I'm not, I'm not gonna, I don't, I'm not opening

191
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:14,449
anything else up. I'm not gonna open up Facebook.

192
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:19,780
Well, that was fun. Let's go back to the other games we could play.

193
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:24,500
Games, hopefully that were made in the last 10 to 15 years or clickable, maybe.

194
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:36,050
A game we're gonna do by show. So let's go like this.

195
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,809
Go like that. There, that looks better.

196
00:47:39,809 --> 00:48:02,630
All right. Ed, Edd, and Eddie, here we come. Why are people clicking on Courage

197
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:18,099
the Cowardly Dog again? Guys, what are you thinking? You

198
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:19,860
don't really want me to click that again.

199
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:36,320
That was a Courage the Cowardly Dog creepypasta. Ed, Edd, and Eddie.

200
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:44,710
Oh, no. No, it's because I didn't have the thing on.

201
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,750
Hold on, that doesn't count. That doesn't count. I didn't put on the thing where

202
00:48:47,750 --> 00:49:07,320
you can't vote more than once. Here, fine. Guys, can I please start

203
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:38,500
streaming? Thank you. Thank you everybody.

204
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,079
You know, I am just gonna pull, I'll pull up a Ouija board.

205
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,960
No, that's a bad, that's a biggest mistake I've ever made in my whole

206
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,190
life, is pulling up a fucking Ouija board.

207
00:49:51,190 --> 00:50:04,800
All right, it's, Edd, and Eddie wins. Thank you for participating everybody.

208
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,320
Ooh, and we not only have, we have more than

209
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:21,750
a few options here. Let me restart it. We've got cul-de-sac smash,

210
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,440
Edd, Edd, and Eddie's candy machine, lunchroom rumble, or

211
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:42,289
spin stadium. By the way, the title says Nickelodeon. Okay, we've got

212
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:58,579
cul-de-sac smash. Got pretty good radio, 44 million plays.

213
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:18,579
Looks like this is gonna be the one. Let's see how it is. Here we go.

214
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:27,159
Cul-de-sac smash. Okay, instructions. Accelerate.

215
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:36,610
Well, let's turn it up a little. I can't do this. This music is gonna make

216
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:42,960
me fucking scream. This is nightmare music. When each

217
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,679
derby to advance to the next locat- I can't even talk, I have to take my

218
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:48,630
headphones off. When each derby to advance to the

219
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,510
next location earn cash by competing in the derbies

220
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:55,030
that make repairs and build new go-karts in the shop.

221
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:59,440
In a collision, the faster go-cart does more damage. Keep an eye on your

222
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,400
damage meter. Okay, choose driver.

223
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:34,800
Never, that is an option. Okay, looks like we're gonna be

224
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:44,960
Edd. All right, Edd, to the tournament. This is all

225
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,440
locked anyways, to the garage. Get a dollar for first prize.

226
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,239
Okay, I'm ready. Zippy, pick a go-kart.

227
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:58,519
All right, that's all I can do. Start the derby.

228
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:01,829
Here we go.

229
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:12,420
This is so loud. Oh shit, this is on screen.

230
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:33,619
Get off the screen. I don't understand what's happening. Is it just bumper

231
00:53:33,619 --> 00:54:05,969
cars? I guess. Rolf is out.

232
00:54:05,969 --> 00:54:11,300
All right, I don't know how much I can take this.

233
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:22,230
That was fun. All right, okay, uh, that was Edd, Edd, and Eddie. Thanks

234
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:44,159
for playing Edd and Eddie. Oh, I gotta pee. Let me, can I piss?

235
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:49,730
I was like rage drinking water. I'm gonna pee. Let me, I'll be right back.

236
00:54:49,730 --> 00:58:53,880
You gotta, you gotta keep like clicking on the screen. All right.

237
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:03,039
Okay, okay. What'd you guys do? Oh, you guys circled the toilet real well.

238
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:21,920
All right, let's, let's get away from Cartoon Network, okay? Let's go to,

239
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:35,110
we're on Miniclip. Or, this is not gonna even work.

240
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:39,489
Is this actually gonna work? Okay, it is gonna work. But you guys can't

241
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:49,750
even control this. Okay, we can all play this. You ready?

242
00:59:49,750 --> 01:00:00,639
I gotta think of a question. Hold on. This is only gonna work, guys, if we all

243
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:10,119
put our fingers on it. So, this should work here. Okay,

244
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:28,659
let me make this a little bit bigger. All right, that looks all right.

245
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:33,329
So, the only way a Ouija board works is we all have to hold our hands on

246
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:46,679
it. So, close that for a second. I have, we have to ask it a

247
01:00:46,679 --> 01:01:01,059
question. So, the question is, um, the question is, what's a good

248
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:12,369
question to ask? Okay, what, what's, what's my, what is my,

249
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:21,139
uh, what is my first name? Let's see what it does.

250
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:28,800
Okay, you guys ready? Gotta put your hand on the Ouija. Put it on there.

251
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:51,269
No, no, not, not, goodbye, not, not clear.

252
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:56,869
Which one of you guys is doing this? Who's doing this? What the heck?

253
01:01:56,869 --> 01:02:01,860
Whoa, this is, fuck, what the heck? One of you guys is doing this, right?

254
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:11,239
Like, one of you guys is touching this, right?

255
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:26,739
That was fun. All right, pick one of these. I'm just gonna get as many of them as I

256
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:31,380
can. This is, uh, this is Nickelodeon.

257
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:39,650
Nickelodeon's hard because the, the website's really not that great.

258
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:47,719
So, hold on. Let me make this smaller. See, the website kind of sucks.

259
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:53,199
So, we can't, you guys gotta be really pinpoint on here.

260
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:59,760
This is gonna take a lot of accuracy and I gotta zoom in because there's no

261
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,000
way you're gonna, there's gonna be any accuracy at all. All right,

262
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,559
I don't know what, what, there's nothing even in these spaces. Okay,

263
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:16,710
uh, here we go. Why did I know that was what was gonna happen?

264
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:27,269
I knew that was gonna happen. What does this do? Is this gonna, like, make a fart

265
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:29,190
noise? If, okay, if this makes a fart noise,

266
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:38,719
then I'm leaving the website. I don't care how many fun games are on here.

267
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,960
All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is, okay, so I'm obviously

268
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:47,840
gonna click it, but this is more important.

269
01:03:47,840 --> 01:04:03,960
Okay, here we go. Please, uh, answer that question, please.

270
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:23,360
On your screen right now. Will it make a fart noise?

271
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:29,880
Oh, that's pretty lit. All right, let's, moment of truth.

272
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:36,550
Uh, that was way more elaborate than just it going like,

273
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:52,449
that's what I thought it was gonna do. Play, no, I don't want to play,

274
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:58,289
uh, AccuNator. AccuNator is, but we're just sitting here asking a fake genie

275
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:11,380
questions about, like, YouTubers. All right, pick again. Oh, no, shit.

276
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:26,159
No. I'm on, I'm on AccuNator. Whatever.

277
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,210
Do you guys, you guys want to play around with AccuNator? I'm not gonna

278
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,929
say anything. I'm gonna be silent and you guys have to pick.

279
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:45,730
Why do you guys want to click this stupid fucking thing?

280
01:05:47,570 --> 01:06:15,190
Because it says not to. What did you expect? Yeah, I know, I'm just kidding

281
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:20,159
around. All right, so let's go, I'll do, let's go to AccuNator.

282
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:33,400
Give me a second. There's absolutely no way that I'll beat Winnie the Pooh

283
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:42,280
baseball. Well, I mean, I already did. Uh, okay, so I need to zoom in for

284
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,519
this. You guys are gonna play this, not me. I have nothing to do with

285
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:48,719
this. I'm just here in control of, I'm just in control of the, uh,

286
01:06:49,719 --> 01:07:10,320
the, the boxes here. Okay, so let me just make sure it is in the right place.

287
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:17,920
It is, and here you go. So, actually, I'm gonna make this a little bit

288
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:40,230
bigger, because it kind of has to be, right?

289
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:56,309
Even bigger than that. Even bigger than that. Hold on.

290
01:07:56,309 --> 01:08:00,949
We don't even need the genie here, do we? He's, like, a pretty big deal,

291
01:08:00,949 --> 01:08:09,599
isn't he? Part of the game. You need to be able

292
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:18,710
to see the question, though. No, we need him. No, you don't. There.

293
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:33,479
All right, he's still in it. He's still there. All right, here we go.

294
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:37,569
Is your character a girl? Oh, this didn't really work.

295
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:43,760
I'm pretty sure that's a no. Yeah, okay, it works. No, it works. It's

296
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,760
pretty, all right, if I go a little bit, let me go a little bit higher. Hold

297
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:52,210
on. There. But you guys, you guys can't

298
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:54,689
read that. You have to wait till I read the question, then.

299
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:57,680
Because there's no way we're going to be able to put it all on the

300
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:01,359
screen. All right, that's definitely a no.

301
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:08,520
So, I'm going to click no. Character's not a girl. Yeah, but if I

302
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,520
read it to you guys, some of you guys are just going to start clicking the

303
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:19,000
screen. All right, character, no, no, no, wait,

304
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:24,640
character's not a girl. Is your character

305
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,850
real? Okay, when I say the question, when I say the question is when you guys

306
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:40,680
can vote. Okay, ready? Is your character real?

307
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:48,439
But how can you guys all play this together when nobody knows what you're

308
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:58,529
even voting for? You all have a different character in

309
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:01,800
your head, so how would this make any sense?

310
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:15,699
Is your character real? Okay, no. Okay, hold on.

311
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:19,430
So now, let me read the next question to you. Although you can even see it.

312
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:27,000
Is your character from a video game? Looks like a majority of you are

313
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:42,529
clicking on yes. Okay, so the character's from a video game.

314
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:49,600
Already got plenty of clicks. Okay, so character yes is from a video game.

315
01:10:49,600 --> 01:11:02,119
The next one is, does your character use guns? I just have, I just have

316
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:07,010
5,000 people in a room. I'm just standing on a stage while I point to

317
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:20,050
the screen for you guys. All right, character doesn't, I don't

318
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,329
even know who you guys are trying to make.

319
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:25,560
Don't tell me who it is, because I don't know who you're trying to make. Okay,

320
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:42,720
character does not use guns. Does your character wear clothes?

321
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:58,100
Okay, a majority of you are saying yeah. All right,

322
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:06,869
wears clothes. Does your character wear a hat often?

323
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:11,119
Yes. Who the fuck are you guys talking about? No, no. Wait, hold on a

324
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:20,100
minute. This seems pretty split. No, does not

325
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:25,539
wear a hat. Doesn't wear a hat, has clothes on, is

326
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:33,670
from a video game. Okay, no. All right.

327
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:49,720
Does your character have hair? No, that's a majority.

328
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,210
Yeah, everybody's clicking that. Okay, no.

329
01:12:54,210 --> 01:13:19,430
Is your character a skeleton? We almost just got sansed right there.

330
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:28,479
No, the character is not a skeleton. Yeah, according to you guys.

331
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:42,340
No. Is your character from a horror game? Who would be

332
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:53,140
no, not from a horror game. That's a majority no.

333
01:13:53,140 --> 01:14:04,930
Is your character bad? Like a bad guy or what?

334
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:18,869
Probably. Why somebody you guys putting on? Probably. Seems pretty,

335
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:28,529
you guys seem pretty torn apart on this one. Answer is no. Okay, does your

336
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:55,619
character fight? That's overwhelming. Okay, so yes. Does

337
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:19,989
your character have human skin? Click his nose? No.

338
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:42,579
Does your character play for the Golden State Warriors?

339
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:58,000
That's so specific. Probably. No. Is your character an animal?

340
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,250
That's a huge, that's an overwhelming. No one's even clicking anything else

341
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:22,130
except for his nose. Okay, does your character

342
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:26,979
live with their brother? Oh, wait a minute. Well, you guys, are you guys

343
01:16:26,979 --> 01:16:31,439
doing Pete and Pete on me here? That's what you're doing. Everyone

344
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:34,239
collectively, all 5,000, you decided you're gonna make, you're gonna do

345
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,109
Pete and Pete. That's pretty, that's really, really

346
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:43,239
good idea. Nice work, guys. Oh, no, it's not.

347
01:16:43,239 --> 01:17:06,840
Doesn't live with brother, okay. All right. Is your character short? No.

348
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:10,760
No, okay. No, the character is not short, so you guys aren't doing like a

349
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:15,199
laugh out loud, let's pick the streamer guy thing, right?

350
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:27,569
Is your character involved in a blizzard game? Blizzard?

351
01:17:27,569 --> 01:17:31,619
I don't think this is, I don't know what you guys are doing,

352
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:35,920
but I don't think, I don't think you guys

353
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:49,270
are on the right track. No. Do you control your character?

354
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,930
I love, this is so, this is so fun to me.

355
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:57,859
You guys are collectively trying to play Accunator.

356
01:17:57,859 --> 01:18:03,539
Who knows what the fuck you're gonna, I, here, I don't even know.

357
01:18:03,619 --> 01:18:06,420
Do you, you don't control your character? No.

358
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:11,960
It's not a video game, hold on, how is that, is your character been in a movie?

359
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:26,680
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, this is yes. Is it?

360
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:31,119
I don't, I don't know what that is. Whoa! You guys have no idea what you're

361
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:33,039
doing. You guys don't, you're not on the

362
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,319
same page at all. You guys are not on the same page.

363
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:53,250
That's so even. That is scarily even. Okay, apparently it's no.

364
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:59,539
No. Your character has, has not been in a movie.

365
01:18:59,539 --> 01:19:07,140
Is your character known for their lips? What does that mean?

366
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:20,720
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean. Okay, no.

367
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:39,670
What is this? Okay, no. Is that no? That looks pretty no to me, down here.

368
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:55,220
I can't tell the split, if there is a split. There might be a split here.

369
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,779
I need to reset and enhance this. Click a little bit lower, guys.

370
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:07,699
I can't, I don't know what it is. I'm gonna reset it.

371
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:21,649
Oh shit, it's no. That's a big no. No, no, no.

372
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:27,279
Okay. Uh, who did you make? He's got even more, I thought it was 20 questions.

373
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:32,359
What's with the more than 21? Is your character in a team of four?

374
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:42,640
What? How many questions is he allowed to ask?

375
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:47,729
No, he's not in a team of four. As many as he needs to.

376
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:55,000
Okay, not in a team of four. Has my character ever gone on tour?

377
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:16,149
I don't know what that means. No. Wait, there's a lot of people

378
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:22,960
that don't know. Yes, no, don't know, probably. You

379
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:33,489
guys are all over the place. I think we might have to enhance.

380
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:38,770
Yeah, gonna have to, just for this question, I gotta pull this up a little.

381
01:21:38,770 --> 01:22:14,659
Do it again. Don't know. Well, I don't know.

382
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:21,970
Oh, you didn't know? Don't know. Why's my B or B screen still on?

383
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:25,729
Okay. Don't know if he's ever gone on tour.

384
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:38,529
This next question is, is your character linked with Undertale?

385
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:58,550
No. Okay, not linked with Undertale. Is your character heavily muscular?

386
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:12,659
Heavily muscular. Yes. All right, I think I know what you guys are doing now.

387
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:24,149
I think I know what you guys are doing. This next one is, actually I can

388
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:29,250
probably shrink this a little bit so you can see the question.

389
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:41,170
No, it's too hard. All right, can we get Mr. Genie out of here?

390
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:46,279
Okay, there we go. Is your character from the Fallout

391
01:23:46,279 --> 01:24:02,760
series? Somebody came in and said, oh, you guys are still playing this.

392
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:10,609
No, it's not from Fallout. We're at question 25.

393
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:17,250
I think it's Bowler from Clash of Clans. Is this who you guys were doing?

394
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:25,560
Is this what you were making? Bowler from Clash of Clans.

395
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:40,310
What were you guys going for? You wanted Glooman.

396
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:49,890
I mean, that's kind of close. That's actually pretty close.

397
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,210
You're wrong, though. I am wrong. Continue.

398
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:06,850
That's eerily close, though. That's so funny. Hold on.

399
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:21,359
Okay, do you speak with your character?

400
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,279
And make sure when you're clicking, make sure your clicks are pinpoint accuracy.

401
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,960
That way we get to keep the Genie on screen.

402
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:40,100
Okay, do you speak with your character? No, apparently not.

403
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:47,270
I think he's broken. Well, did he skip like five questions?

404
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:54,050
What was that? What were we just on? Question like 23?

405
01:25:54,689 --> 01:26:05,250
Is your character from a large family? I don't know.

406
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:15,239
Probably. No. Don't you need to enhance this?

407
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:23,619
I might have to enhance this. Looks like it's mostly on no.

408
01:26:23,619 --> 01:26:35,439
That actually makes it a little easier. There we go. Okay.

409
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:47,989
All right, let's try it again. This looks like don't know.

410
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:06,819
Nose. The nose has not won. It's don't know.

411
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:18,930
Okay, don't know. Does your character go pearl diving?

412
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:22,850
Pearl diving. Is it like a cartoon character that dives for pearls?

413
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:31,729
That's a lot of don't knows and knows. You guys are trying.

414
01:27:31,810 --> 01:27:38,930
So very hard for this. So very hard. It's either no or don't know.

415
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:41,569
That's too close to call. That's like a 30-30 split.

416
01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:47,859
That's like 33-33. And some of you guys clicking on the nose

417
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:57,640
are not participating. I'm gonna say that's don't know.

418
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,600
Or no. Yeah, look at the circle here. Yeah, that's no.

419
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:15,159
Does your character eat pickles? This doesn't do anything.

420
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:25,760
Probably? I thought you guys were making glue man.

421
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:38,880
Why does glue man probably eat pickles? Okay, that's what it is.

422
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:47,079
Probably. Okay. Is your character an alien?

423
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,729
No, that's a no. Look at that.

424
01:28:57,729 --> 01:29:02,930
I mean, it's split a little bit, but I would say that's a no.

425
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:11,380
Let me go like... I'm just gonna read the questions for you guys.

426
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,380
We'll keep his nose on screen.

427
01:29:24,689 --> 01:29:26,529
All right. Okay. All right. All right.

428
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:28,369
All right. Now answer the question.

429
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:38,789
Okay. All right. So it's no. Is your character an alien?

430
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:39,909
The character's not an alien.

431
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:50,260
I have to read this question before anyone clicks anything.

432
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:53,800
That's why I'm turning it off.

433
01:29:53,800 --> 01:30:00,609
Does your character wear armor?

434
01:30:00,609 --> 01:30:10,180
Really, guys? A hundred percent of you?

435
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,380
No, he doesn't. Don't.

436
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:12,899
We're on a question. 32.

437
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:20,069
Is your character from Paw Patrol?

438
01:30:34,739 --> 01:30:37,220
Like three of you guys clicked probably.

439
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:49,600
No, your character's not from Paw Patrol.

440
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,670
Is your character... What the fuck does this mean?

441
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:57,109
This is what happens when you go past 30 questions in Akinator, guys.

442
01:30:57,670 --> 01:31:00,229
Is your character your own flesh and blood?

443
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:08,979
How would it guess your son?

444
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:24,319
Wow. This is pretty even.

445
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,399
If only one out of every five of you didn't click on the nose,

446
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,720
we'd have a better indicator of what this is.

447
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:45,989
All right. Do it again.

448
01:31:45,989 --> 01:31:50,069
This time, I want the one out of five of you to answer.

449
01:31:52,479 --> 01:32:18,789
Is your character your own flesh and blood?

450
01:32:18,869 --> 01:32:38,020
Is your character your flesh and blood?

451
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:43,920
Is your character your own flesh and blood?

452
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,039
You motherfuckers!

453
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:55,970
No! What the hell?

454
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:10,130
Is your character your flesh and blood?

455
01:33:21,909 --> 01:33:22,789
The answer is no.

456
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:26,819
Okay, good.

457
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:29,439
This... You guys are so off.

458
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:31,359
This is not even remotely close to anything.

459
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:37,729
We're going to get like Gandalf here in like fucking 10 seconds.

460
01:33:37,729 --> 01:33:41,250
Watch.

461
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:44,210
Okay. Is your character...

462
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:50,630
Is your character a koala bear?

463
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:10,020
No, not a koala bear.

464
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:10,739
He's thinking.

465
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:11,779
He's thinking real hard.

466
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:17,300
Is your character from YouTube?

467
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:30,159
Yes.

468
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:33,430
All right. Question 35.

469
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:45,439
Is your character known as a troll?

470
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:53,750
Is anybody going to click on the actual answer?

471
01:34:53,750 --> 01:35:13,880
Okay. No. Not known as a troll.

472
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,560
What is... Why would this make any...

473
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:16,760
Does your character...

474
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:26,000
Does your character have teeth?

475
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,199
We want the nose.

476
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:32,159
No. It seems like a lot of you guys are saying yes.

477
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:42,800
Does he have teeth?

478
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,229
All right. Yes.

479
01:35:47,329 --> 01:35:48,449
Oh, boy.

480
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:52,199
Congratulations, guys.

481
01:35:52,199 --> 01:35:53,800
Is your character a wrestler?

482
01:35:53,800 --> 01:36:00,739
I think you did it.

483
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:02,020
I think you guys did it.

484
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:09,810
It only took you nearly 40 questions.

485
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:11,920
Yes.

486
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,460
And 38 questions.

487
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,500
You got it! I can...

488
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,420
Wow. That happened.

489
01:36:18,420 --> 01:36:22,800
You did it.

490
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,760
You got Glooman.

491
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:36,739
Congratulations.

492
01:36:36,739 --> 01:36:38,020
He submitted himself.

493
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:39,520
I love down here.

Copyright IP policy.

495
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:43,829
What if I was just like,

496
01:36:43,829 --> 01:36:45,270
Oh, no. You know, I don't want him on here.

497
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:46,550
I don't want him on here.

498
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,189
What?

499
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:49,479
Whose copyright is this?

500
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,130
Well, there you go.

501
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:58,930
You did it.

502
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:02,399
Did you copyright Glooman?

503
01:37:03,939 --> 01:37:08,689
Yes.

504
01:37:08,689 --> 01:37:09,329
What does this do?

505
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:10,930
Hold on. I want to see what this does.

506
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:17,060
How come I can't do that?

507
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,140
All right. Well, that was AccuNator.

508
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:23,350
How about this?

509
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:24,869
I'm not going to say anything.

510
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:27,270
I'm going to read you guys

511
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:30,390
the first three questions

512
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:31,670
and then you're just on your own.

513
01:37:31,670 --> 01:37:38,239
Well, what is this?

514
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,520
Great. Guest right.

515
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,949
Character already played 882 times.

516
01:37:48,689 --> 01:37:49,890
Last time somebody did this

517
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,810
was in September of this year.

518
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:56,550
Holy shit.

519
01:37:58,899 --> 01:37:59,859
Let me like fix this.

520
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,239
So this webpage thing is all fucked up.

521
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:08,880
Hold on.

522
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,270
Keep that.

523
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,989
Keep that.

524
01:38:13,989 --> 01:38:19,520
Why can I not...

525
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,189
There we go.

526
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,529
All right.

527
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,659
So next.

528
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:33,600
Why did I say September?

529
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,439
Because that was September.

530
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:37,439
That's the last time it was played.

531
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:41,119
That's the last time somebody guessed Glooman.

532
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,180
There's an EU date.

533
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:56,439
What?

534
01:38:56,439 --> 01:38:58,819
Oh, I thought that...

535
01:38:58,819 --> 01:39:00,819
Okay. So it was today, apparently.

536
01:39:00,819 --> 01:39:01,539
All right.

537
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:06,149
But that's not even today.

538
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,149
It's currently the eighth right now.

539
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:15,800
That's tomorrow.

540
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,600
Not an EU.

541
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:20,930
Oh, well.

542
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,359
All right.

543
01:39:22,359 --> 01:39:23,560
Check my clock.

544
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,130
All right. Let's go to...

545
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:30,720
Let's go back to a Flash game this time.

546
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:37,170
Okay. How about here?

547
01:39:37,170 --> 01:39:38,050
All right. I'm not doing that

548
01:39:38,050 --> 01:39:43,810
because I don't want to buy any more shit.

549
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:45,729
Let's go back to the Nickelodeon page.

550
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:51,409
Close this up.

551
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:52,960
And this.

552
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:57,010
Back to Nickelodeon.

553
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:07,000
Let's make this better on the screen.

554
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:07,560
All right.

555
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,800
Which Nickelodeon game do you want me to play?

556
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,800
Go play chess.

557
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,920
That would be impossible.

558
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,359
That's not going to be possible.

559
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:29,779
Do you know how that's not even going to work?

560
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:32,949
How are you supposed to...

561
01:40:32,949 --> 01:40:34,470
You guys have to select a unit

562
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:35,510
and then I have to do another poll

563
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:42,399
and select where the unit goes.

564
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:43,279
Oh, my Lord.

565
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:44,800
That's going to be unbearable.

566
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,979
All right. Let's do it.

567
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:48,899
All right. We're doing SpongeBob Surf Cell.

568
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:54,529
It's going to be loud.

569
01:40:54,770 --> 01:41:02,079
This is such a tiny screen.

570
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:11,560
Select game mode.

571
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,159
Well, you guys are not clicking in an accurate manner.

572
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:32,979
This is seagull.

573
01:41:32,979 --> 01:41:34,420
All right. Looks like we're going to be SpongeBob.

574
01:41:39,729 --> 01:41:40,449
Select a board.

575
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:42,760
Well, it has to be the ice cream cone.

576
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,859
Who are these characters?

577
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:46,899
No. I've got to be SpongeBob.

578
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,590
Select chorus.

579
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:12,689
All right. Looks like we're going here.

580
01:42:12,689 --> 01:42:19,460
Okay.

581
01:42:24,199 --> 01:42:25,880
Easy-peasy. Normal or hard?

582
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:31,409
Play checkers.

583
01:42:31,409 --> 01:42:32,850
We'll play checkers and we'll play chess.

584
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:38,640
Hard.

585
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:39,920
All right. Here we go.

586
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,439
I'm ready.

587
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:42,800
How to play.

588
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:43,840
Move in space to jump.

589
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:44,800
Avoid the break.

590
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,720
This is fucking killing my ears.

591
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:57,760
Let's go.

592
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,520
I don't get it.

593
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:02,720
Okay. There we go.

594
01:43:03,909 --> 01:43:04,310
Go up.

595
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:11,250
It doesn't...

596
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:11,729
I don't...

597
01:43:11,729 --> 01:43:12,369
This doesn't work.

598
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:22,520
Okay.

599
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:24,920
So it's not just up and down on the arrow keys.

600
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,479
Go for the jump.

601
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:32,550
Nice. I got an achievement.

602
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,520
All right. Let's play checkers.

603
01:43:51,520 --> 01:44:03,119
Let me zoom in so you get a good view of this

604
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,619
and you guys can actually pick.

605
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:10,710
This is going to be...

606
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:11,750
Give me a second. This is going to take us.

607
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:14,149
This is going to take a second to get this the way that I want it.

608
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:19,270
Let me see if that...

609
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,989
Did that work?

610
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:21,670
Kind of.

611
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:30,210
All right. Let me make sure it's good.

612
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:31,810
Then I'm going to stretch it out.

613
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:39,109
This is going to be really, really ugly.

614
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:43,159
But, you know, we kind of have to do what we've got to do here.

615
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:45,239
Okay. Are you guys ready?

616
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:49,270
Do you get ready to play checkers?

617
01:45:03,329 --> 01:45:04,369
You want me to mute it?

618
01:45:04,369 --> 01:45:13,670
Why am I muting the sound?

619
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:21,539
Why would you want me to mute the sound versus bot?

620
01:45:21,539 --> 01:45:22,739
Holy fuck. This is ugly.

621
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:23,380
Hold on.

622
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:42,390
This has to be stretched.

623
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:42,789
Okay.

624
01:45:44,039 --> 01:45:45,560
Make sure you're very accurate.

625
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:48,439
So the goal here...

626
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:57,220
The goal here is to make sure the first thing you pick first,

627
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,500
the one that you want to move,

628
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:01,800
then the next one after that is where you're moving it to.

629
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,079
Okay.

630
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,789
So pick the one that you'd like to move.

631
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:11,779
Us versus you.

632
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:13,119
Okay.

633
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,159
Yeah. No, that's a good idea.

634
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:14,720
Okay.

635
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:31,039
All right.

636
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:32,560
So I think it's...

637
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,579
Is it my move?

638
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:36,550
So you guys are here.

639
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:37,189
Okay.

640
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:40,680
So it's my move.

641
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:48,420
Okay. Your move.

642
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,359
It has to be consensus.

643
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,680
It has to be consensus.

644
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:07,159
All right.

645
01:47:07,159 --> 01:47:09,560
It looks like you guys want this one,

646
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:15,600
is what my understanding is.

647
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,500
All right.

648
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,020
So I'm going to pick...

649
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:19,539
I'm picking this one up.

650
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:22,930
Where would you like me to move this one here?

651
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:33,319
Those are your two choices.

652
01:47:33,319 --> 01:47:33,720
All right.

653
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:36,840
Once there's a thousand votes,

654
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,840
I think that's the consensus is made.

655
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:41,159
Okay. My turn.

656
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:53,159
Your turn.

657
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:55,319
Remember, you got to pick the one that you want to move.

658
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:06,640
A thousand votes have been tallied.

659
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:06,960
All right.

660
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,210
It's going to be this one here.

661
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:11,649
And where would you like me to move it?

662
01:48:11,649 --> 01:48:15,729
Oh, it can't go anywhere else.

663
01:48:16,949 --> 01:48:19,109
Okay. There you go.

664
01:48:19,109 --> 01:48:19,909
My turn.

665
01:48:19,909 --> 01:48:23,029
Okay.

666
01:48:25,939 --> 01:48:27,859
Sneaky little move you guys are pulling here.

667
01:48:27,859 --> 01:48:30,899
All right.

668
01:48:30,899 --> 01:48:31,859
Which one would you like me to move?

669
01:48:42,689 --> 01:48:43,890
A thousand votes.

670
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:46,159
You want this one?

671
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:47,750
Where's it going?

672
01:48:57,159 --> 01:48:58,279
The indecision on the...

673
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,600
Change the title of the stream.

674
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,239
Oh, yeah.

675
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:05,239
I kind of do, don't I?

676
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:05,560
All right.

677
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:06,199
That's it.

678
01:49:06,199 --> 01:49:07,539
It looks like you're going over here.

679
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,569
Big mistake.

680
01:49:17,569 --> 01:49:18,609
Big mistake.

681
01:49:18,609 --> 01:49:51,250
I've made my decision.

682
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,449
It's time for you to make yours.

683
01:49:52,449 --> 01:50:02,359
Going...

684
01:50:02,359 --> 01:50:03,399
Ah, all right.

685
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:04,020
Yeah.

686
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:10,210
That's a decent play.

687
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:16,119
And there's only one place where that can go.

688
01:50:16,119 --> 01:50:17,079
My turn.

689
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:18,689
Pretty decent block.

690
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:23,380
But, I mean, you really weren't...

691
01:50:23,939 --> 01:50:24,739
You just really weren't...

692
01:50:24,739 --> 01:50:25,300
No, maybe...

693
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,500
Well, hold on there.

694
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,699
Slow down, Jeremy.

695
01:50:27,699 --> 01:50:29,779
Don't go too crazy here.

696
01:50:29,779 --> 01:50:51,779
Go to this one and go to here.

697
01:50:51,779 --> 01:51:03,010
Your move.

698
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:03,970
Protect the queen.

699
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:04,930
There is no queen.

700
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,659
All right.

701
01:51:10,659 --> 01:51:11,300
The back...

702
01:51:11,300 --> 01:51:13,670
Your back row here.

703
01:51:13,670 --> 01:51:14,789
Only one place it can go.

704
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,529
I'm going to try to go like that.

705
01:51:24,529 --> 01:51:27,010
If I go here, that stops you.

706
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:29,359
So I'm going to go from...

707
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:31,359
If you're going to go there, then I'm going to go...

708
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:31,920
Hold on.

709
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:32,239
Not yet.

710
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:32,720
Wait, wait, wait.

711
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,430
If you jump here, if I go here, that blocks it all.

712
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:37,750
Okay.

713
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:51,350
Your move.

714
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,310
Right in the middle?

715
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:58,869
Only one way to go.

716
01:51:58,869 --> 01:52:01,000
Oh, let this play out for a second.

717
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,560
Hold on.

718
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,029
Thousand votes?

719
01:52:03,029 --> 01:52:04,869
Thousand votes have come in.

720
01:52:04,869 --> 01:52:07,199
Only one place for you to move this.

721
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:12,840
All right.

722
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:18,920
Let me think about this.

723
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,359
Have you come over here?

724
01:52:21,989 --> 01:52:22,630
Now, you got me.

725
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:24,470
You got me in a pretty bad position.

726
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,239
But I might have to lose a...

727
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:32,229
Not yet.

728
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:37,960
You're pretty much stuck.

729
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,199
Good luck.

730
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:49,029
Somebody said, are we winning?

731
01:52:53,859 --> 01:52:57,779
I will...

732
01:52:57,779 --> 01:52:59,649
Okay, here's a confession.

733
01:52:59,649 --> 01:53:03,960
I haven't played checkers in probably...

734
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,199
That would say at least 10 years.

735
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:07,000
At least.

736
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:13,539
All right.

737
01:53:13,539 --> 01:53:15,039
Trying to set me up here.

738
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:15,760
Oh, look at this.

739
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:23,239
Interesting.

740
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:24,039
Interesting.

741
01:53:24,039 --> 01:53:40,739
I mean, mandatory jump.

742
01:53:40,739 --> 01:53:42,340
Oh, you're going to make one of the...

743
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:53,090
All right, go ahead.

744
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:59,079
Unanimously, my turn.

745
01:53:59,079 --> 01:54:02,470
I have to go this way.

746
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:09,779
Another mandatory jump.

747
01:54:13,239 --> 01:54:15,079
No, baby!

748
01:54:15,079 --> 01:54:19,199
Would you take a look at this?

749
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:29,590
Another mandatory jump.

750
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:33,600
What is happening?

751
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:39,199
Okay, your turn.

752
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:48,560
I just wiped the board with you guys.

753
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,520
Come on.

754
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,039
I haven't rode...

755
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:53,039
I haven't ridden on a bike in like 10 years.

756
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:54,899
This one?

757
01:54:54,899 --> 01:54:58,600
You don't have to jump.

758
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,960
It says mandatory jump.

759
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,199
You guys can't...

760
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,319
It's on the screen up here.

761
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:03,359
You guys can't see it.

762
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:05,939
Okay.

763
01:55:05,939 --> 01:55:11,189
So I can only go in one place.

764
01:55:11,189 --> 01:55:11,670
Liar.

765
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:12,229
Wait, hold on.

766
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,710
I thought...

767
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:13,270
See, look.

768
01:55:13,270 --> 01:55:14,630
Look, look, look, look, look.

769
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:15,270
Look.

770
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:16,149
Look at this.

771
01:55:16,149 --> 01:55:18,600
You want me to show you?

772
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,560
Mandatory jump.

773
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,640
I have to do this.

774
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:26,260
See?

775
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:33,000
Liar.

776
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:33,960
I can't click anything else.

777
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,520
Look.

778
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:40,050
I have to do this.

779
01:55:40,050 --> 01:55:40,770
And by the way...

780
01:55:42,609 --> 01:55:48,399
All right, wait, you want me to go?

781
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:04,720
It seems kind of conflicted though.

782
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,520
Delete the game.

783
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,119
Delete the game.

784
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:16,100
I think it's this one.

785
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:16,819
It is.

786
01:56:16,819 --> 01:56:18,359
There's only one way you can move.

787
01:56:18,359 --> 01:56:22,039
Yeah, that's a thousand votes almost there.

788
01:56:22,039 --> 01:56:25,590
How do you flip the table?

789
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:35,350
Click on the top right to surrender.

790
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:35,829
My turn.

791
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,909
What do I mean?

792
01:56:39,909 --> 01:56:40,789
I got so many pieces.

793
01:56:40,789 --> 01:56:42,710
How about a free king me?

794
01:56:42,710 --> 01:56:53,460
Where to?

795
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:56,180
Almost a hundred percent are clicking in the top, right?

796
01:56:56,180 --> 01:57:02,199
You guys surrendering?

797
01:57:02,199 --> 01:57:03,079
Is this a surrender?

798
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:09,920
Surrender.

799
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:11,359
Hold on.

800
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:12,880
Let me make sure that that's not what you got.

801
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,000
You guys want me to move this?

802
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:14,960
You can't move this piece.

803
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:16,880
That's a surrender.

804
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:25,779
Thanks for playing.

805
01:57:25,779 --> 01:57:26,420
All right.

806
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:27,939
Let's play chess now.

807
01:57:27,939 --> 01:57:35,109
Time for chess.

808
01:57:35,109 --> 01:57:36,149
IQ test.

809
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:37,909
Oh, that's a good one.

810
01:57:37,909 --> 01:57:42,289
Let's see just how smart you guys really are.

811
01:57:42,289 --> 01:57:48,640
Okay.

812
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:51,800
Let's see what this one is.

813
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:59,640
I think I have to pay for this.

814
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:00,199
Yeah, this thing.

815
01:58:00,199 --> 01:58:01,000
I have to pay for this.

816
01:58:09,489 --> 01:58:10,930
I'm looking for a free one.

817
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:12,930
Free quick IQ test.

818
01:58:12,930 --> 01:58:16,279
I don't know if this is legit.

819
01:58:18,659 --> 01:58:19,939
This has got a bad score.

820
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:20,579
Okay, hold on.

821
01:58:20,579 --> 01:58:20,819
Test.

822
01:58:21,539 --> 01:58:23,189
All right.

823
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:23,989
Hold on.

824
01:58:23,989 --> 01:58:34,319
Let me get this back on the screen.

825
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:47,010
Where is it?

826
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:49,090
This one, by the way, has a time limit.

827
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:51,329
So no, this is not going to work.

828
01:58:51,329 --> 01:58:51,890
You guys.

829
01:58:51,890 --> 01:58:53,489
Yeah, this 5,000 people.

830
01:58:53,489 --> 01:59:00,369
Half of you can just Google the answer.

831
01:59:00,369 --> 01:59:02,149
That's not going to work.

832
01:59:02,149 --> 01:59:08,039
No, I'm not even doing this.

833
01:59:08,039 --> 01:59:09,640
Maybe that's what the time limit is for.

834
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:19,140
Okay, let me get this in the right spot.

835
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:25,829
So I think I can make this bigger

836
01:59:25,829 --> 01:59:28,720
because this is the only spot where the test is.

837
01:59:37,399 --> 01:59:39,800
Why does this have such bad ratings?

838
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,159
Hold on.

839
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:46,199
I'll get it right.

840
01:59:46,199 --> 01:59:48,199
Why is this a long ass website?

841
01:59:48,199 --> 01:59:49,000
Come on.

842
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,210
There we go.

843
01:59:50,210 --> 01:59:54,680
Because you have to be able to click the answers.

844
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:58,500
Let me just see.

845
01:59:58,500 --> 01:59:59,460
Okay, hold on.

846
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:00,020
Wait.

847
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:00,659
This is not real.

848
02:00:00,659 --> 02:00:11,649
This is not real.

849
02:00:11,649 --> 02:00:15,829
You got 25 questions here.

850
02:00:15,829 --> 02:00:19,750
By the way, each one of your responses is getting less than like five seconds.

851
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:24,739
Okay, hold on.

852
02:00:24,739 --> 02:00:25,460
You ready?

853
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:31,250
Let me just re-get this back where I was.

854
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:36,399
Okay, you ready?

855
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:39,159
Starting the test.

856
02:00:39,159 --> 02:00:48,229
When I say go.

857
02:00:48,229 --> 02:00:49,029
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

858
02:00:49,029 --> 02:00:50,869
Okay.

859
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:51,430
Go.

860
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:52,850
What's the smallest amount?

861
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:02,390
17 out of 100.

862
02:01:03,399 --> 02:01:04,199
All right.

863
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:04,520
That's it.

864
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,479
You got 1,000 people.

865
02:01:05,479 --> 02:01:05,880
Next.

866
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,439
17 out of 102.

867
02:01:08,439 --> 02:01:10,720
Next question.

868
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,920
How many states are there in the United States of America?

869
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,500
How many contiguous states?

870
02:01:22,210 --> 02:01:28,079
Okay, five seconds.

871
02:01:28,079 --> 02:01:28,880
50.

872
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:29,600
Okay.

873
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:33,109
That's your answer.

874
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:35,590
What is 0.12 divided by 1?

875
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:45,170
I'm giving this five seconds because people are gonna do the calculator.

876
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:52,199
Okay, done.

877
02:01:52,199 --> 02:01:55,409
Vintage and novelty have what meaning?

878
02:01:55,409 --> 02:01:58,149
Similar, unrelated, or opposite?

879
02:02:05,989 --> 02:02:11,649
Okay, going with similar.

880
02:02:11,649 --> 02:02:12,449
Okay.

881
02:02:12,449 --> 02:02:14,039
Next question.

882
02:02:14,039 --> 02:02:19,140
Adam is selling yarn for 4.04 cents a foot.

883
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:33,670
How many feet can you buy from him for 52 cents?

884
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:35,189
Okay, I'm clicking this one.

885
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:57,239
What is the relation between credence and credit?

886
02:02:57,239 --> 02:02:58,039
Similar.

887
02:02:58,039 --> 02:02:59,239
Unrelated.

888
02:02:59,239 --> 02:02:59,880
Whatever.

889
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:07,680
Which one?

890
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:11,939
Next.

891
02:03:11,939 --> 02:03:14,020
Sarah bought a dress for $44.50.

892
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,539
A purse for $20.80.

893
02:03:15,539 --> 02:03:17,699
And a t-shirt for $14.95.

894
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:19,619
What is the total of her purchases, Chad?

895
02:03:19,619 --> 02:03:28,720
This is calculator bullshit, by the way.

896
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:40,880
I'm giving you guys like a...

897
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:41,359
Hold on.

898
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:41,760
That one's a no.

899
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:45,220
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

900
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:51,380
Okay, what will the value...

901
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:54,420
What will be the value if you reduce this fraction to the lowest term?

902
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:56,260
24 out of 95.

903
02:03:56,260 --> 02:04:04,289
Stop giving them math problems.

904
02:04:04,289 --> 02:04:06,289
We're gonna run out of time.

905
02:04:06,289 --> 02:04:07,409
All right, this one.

906
02:04:07,409 --> 02:04:11,119
Okay.

907
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:14,470
Arrange these words to form a sentence.

908
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:16,579
The sentence you arranged is true or false.

909
02:04:16,579 --> 02:04:18,500
Triangle sides has a three.

910
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:32,279
Let's go.

911
02:04:32,279 --> 02:04:35,960
Okay, reduce and produce have what meaning?

912
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:47,010
You guys have two minutes.

913
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:52,550
No, do it again, because it fucked up.

914
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:59,939
What are you clicking on?

915
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:05,300
Why does it keep changing?

916
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:08,500
Okay, identify the next number in this sequence.

917
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,979
41, 29, 35, 23.

918
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:18,899
Why is this so fucked up?

919
02:05:18,899 --> 02:05:20,819
Is this not even the right spot?

920
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:36,279
Okay, which of these words are a similar meaning?

921
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:40,760
Rapidly, exceedingly, hastily, hastily, eventually, swiftly.

922
02:05:40,760 --> 02:05:47,489
I can't even see the test.

923
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:50,119
But it has to be zoomed in.

924
02:05:50,119 --> 02:05:51,880
Do y'all understand?

925
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:58,500
Do it again.

926
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:01,619
Rapidly, exceedingly, hastily, eventually, swiftly.

927
02:06:01,619 --> 02:06:04,319
Which of these three words is a similar meaning?

928
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:08,949
Okay, rule out the word that doesn't belong here.

929
02:06:11,380 --> 02:06:13,779
Affirmation, designation, approval,

930
02:06:13,779 --> 02:06:17,060
authorization, authorization, or permission, go.

931
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:27,649
Well, it's not my fault that this thing is fucking timed.

932
02:06:27,649 --> 02:06:38,609
Okay, identify the next number in the sequence.

933
02:06:38,609 --> 02:06:41,090
Wait, wait, wait, don't click yet.

934
02:06:41,090 --> 02:06:44,279
Identify the next number in the sequence.

935
02:06:44,279 --> 02:06:45,560
Oh, you did it.

936
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:35,260
Why?

937
02:07:36,119 --> 02:07:37,079
Now I take it.

938
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:51,890
I'm laughing at the fact 75.

939
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:56,840
Because that's not even remotely accurate.

940
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:14,279
It says between 75 and 94.

941
02:08:14,279 --> 02:08:16,520
No, you guys are not doing a personality test.

942
02:08:23,489 --> 02:08:27,329
I'm laughing because the worst indicator you could ever have

943
02:08:27,329 --> 02:08:30,449
is 5,000 people all clicking on the screen.

944
02:08:30,449 --> 02:08:34,210
And it's like, you know what, you're kind of below average.

945
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:36,310
Oh, you think?

946
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:42,439
That's fucking funny.

947
02:08:42,439 --> 02:08:44,359
All right, let me see what else I want to do here.

948
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:50,279
Oh, see if I can do it better.

949
02:08:50,279 --> 02:08:50,779
Okay.

950
02:08:57,539 --> 02:08:58,260
I'll try.

951
02:08:58,260 --> 02:08:59,300
I'm going to try to do it.

952
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:01,520
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

953
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:02,800
I'm going to be dead fucking silent.

954
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:14,520
I got to get this in the right place for you guys to see it.

955
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,640
But let's take it again.

956
02:09:19,729 --> 02:09:24,130
Hold on.

957
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:27,039
All right, so let's start the test here.

958
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:28,319
I'm going to try as hard as I can.

959
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:40,680
Damn.

960
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,880
So you guys can see.

961
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:43,640
All right, I'm ready.

962
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:43,960
Here you go.

963
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:44,460
You ready?

964
02:09:44,539 --> 02:09:46,170
Okay.

965
02:09:46,869 --> 02:09:48,699
Okay.

966
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:51,880
Is there a bar address for $44.50, a purse of $20?

967
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,819
What's the total purchase?

968
02:09:53,819 --> 02:09:54,859
Is it $80?

969
02:09:54,859 --> 02:09:56,779
Well, you guys already...

970
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:04,600
What do you get when you round of $907 to the nearest tens place?

971
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:10,090
Nearest tens place, though.

972
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:21,899
Well, I mean tens place.

973
02:10:21,899 --> 02:10:24,859
Who's ten?

974
02:10:24,859 --> 02:10:25,180
Where's the...

975
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:26,140
What do you mean their place?

976
02:10:26,699 --> 02:10:28,300
I don't know where the nearest tens place is.

977
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:29,340
I don't even know what they sell there.

978
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:30,779
I don't even know if it's at somebody's house.

979
02:10:30,779 --> 02:10:47,260

02:12:51,819 --> 02:12:54,260

1016
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:04,380
how many monkeys are there in the zoo?

1017
02:13:04,380 --> 02:13:05,020
What?

1018
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:08,279
There are three times the amount of monkeys compared to elephants in the zoo.

1019
02:13:08,279 --> 02:13:09,640
88 monkeys and elephants total.

1020
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,680
How many monkeys there in the zoo?

1021
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:11,399

how many?

1024
02:13:14,979 --> 02:13:17,699

Sam is 11 years old.

1041
02:14:02,170 --> 02:14:03,529
Ross is twice as old as Sam.

1042
02:14:03,529 --> 02:14:06,409
So that means, okay, so when Ross is 50 years old, how old will Sam be?

1043
02:14:06,409 --> 02:14:10,539
That's, okay, Ross is twice as old, so that's 22.

1044
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:15,180
So 22 minus, that's 40, 41.

1045
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:16,619
No, it's not, it's 39.

1046
02:14:18,729 --> 02:14:20,170

Jack greeted Jill.

1049
02:14:23,850 --> 02:14:25,130
Jill greeted Joe.

1050
02:14:25,130 --> 02:14:26,489
Jack didn't greet Joe.

1051
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:28,739
What?

1052
02:14:28,739 --> 02:14:29,939
Jack greeted Jill.

1053
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:33,000
Jill greeted Joe.

1054
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,079
I don't know, where are they?

1055
02:14:39,079 --> 02:14:40,039
What room are they in?

1056
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:41,159
I don't know if they talk to each other.

1057
02:14:42,579 --> 02:14:45,539
Jim makes $8.50 an hour and three dollars extra for cleaning a store.

1058
02:14:45,539 --> 02:14:48,420
If you work 36 hours and clean 17 stores, how much money do you make?

1059
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:55,289
36 hours, 36, that's, I got 55 seconds here, hold on.

1060
02:14:55,289 --> 02:14:59,449
Jim makes $8.50 an hour and an extra three dollars for cleaning a store.

1061
02:14:59,449 --> 02:15:01,050
So that's three times 17.

1062
02:15:01,689 --> 02:15:09,189
Three times 17 is 17, three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 17, 17, 20, 30, 40.

1063
02:15:09,189 --> 02:15:13,289
That's 350, no, 320 dollars.

1064
02:15:13,289 --> 02:15:14,890
How many seconds are there in a day?

1065
02:15:14,890 --> 02:15:24,619
365 days a year, 52 weeks in a year, 24 hours in a day, 60, 60 seconds,

1066
02:15:24,619 --> 02:15:29,000
60 seconds in one minute, 60 minutes in one hour, 60 minutes.

1067
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,779
So 60, 60 divided by, there are six, how many 60 seconds are there in a day?

1068
02:15:34,779 --> 02:15:37,289
How many seconds are there in a day?

1069
02:15:37,289 --> 02:15:40,260
86, 400.

1070
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:07,000
Oh, he could be, he could be gifted.

1071
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Design engineer, lawyer, computer programmer, electrical engineer.

1072
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,439
Congratulations, you're considered to be of high average to superior intelligence.

1073
02:16:16,439 --> 02:16:21,960
This IQ score puts you into the top quarter of intelligence for most professions,

1074
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:25,399
but would only be a little above average for a college professor or a medical doctor.

1075
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:30,359
You know, I have just a little bit on the same level as a medical doctor, it's okay.

1076
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:33,559
All the professions that typically contain work is these sorts of IQ including, yeah, whatever.

1077
02:16:33,559 --> 02:16:41,479
What, I said it wrong?

1078
02:16:41,479 --> 02:16:51,750
Quarter, quartile, top quartile percent, top squirtle.

1079
02:16:53,659 --> 02:16:55,340
Oh, it's going into his head now.

1080
02:16:58,540 --> 02:19:35,139
All right, I gotta pee, I'll be right back.

1081
02:19:35,139 --> 02:19:38,540
Okay, okey dokey.

1082
02:19:41,829 --> 02:19:48,200
So, best flash game site.

1083
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:51,590
I'm not fucking going to a random site that I don't know what it is.

1084
02:19:59,700 --> 02:20:05,260
All right, are we supposed to play like flash games?

1085
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:12,409
It's turned into something completely different.

1086
02:20:12,409 --> 02:20:25,020
Minesweeper, let me see, do the alignment test.

1087
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:37,559
That's going to take like three hours.

1088
02:20:37,559 --> 02:20:40,280
We'll do this and then I'm going to go back to like mini clip.

1089
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:45,690
All right, let me get this on the screen.

1090
02:20:45,690 --> 02:20:47,370
How are you ever going to click on these?

1091
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:50,840
There's no way this is possible, we can't play this.

1092
02:20:50,840 --> 02:21:02,790
How the fuck are we supposed to play Minesweeper?

1093
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:09,239
It's not going to happen, it just isn't.

1094
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:10,809
I can try.

1095
02:21:24,629 --> 02:21:38,870
You got to be really accurate.

1096
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:44,680
Here, here, god.

1097
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:51,739
I don't think this is possible.

1098
02:21:51,739 --> 02:22:00,149
No fucking way, okay.

1099
02:22:00,149 --> 02:22:01,670
Oh yeah, this is going to work.

1100
02:22:02,309 --> 02:22:19,670
This is going to work right in the middle, right here.

1101
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:24,379
All right, now I have to enhance.

1102
02:22:24,379 --> 02:22:42,840
How am I going to do this?

1103
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:56,170
Okay, did it break?

1104
02:22:56,170 --> 02:22:59,559
No damn, all right, so we got here versus here.

1105
02:22:59,559 --> 02:23:04,389
Looks like people want me to go here.

1106
02:23:04,389 --> 02:23:06,629
You just, you didn't, we didn't even get to do it one time.

1107
02:23:06,629 --> 02:23:08,069
You just clicked right on a bump.

1108
02:23:08,069 --> 02:23:10,790
We didn't even get one second.

1109
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:27,299
Okay, I'm going to do it again.

1110
02:23:27,299 --> 02:23:32,309
Not even one fucking second of gameplay.

1111
02:23:32,309 --> 02:23:40,379
Okay, here we go.

1112
02:23:40,379 --> 02:23:40,620
Chess?

1113
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:43,819
Yeah, we'll play chess.

1114
02:23:43,819 --> 02:23:45,579
If you guys blow, if you guys fuck it up again,

1115
02:23:45,579 --> 02:23:52,489
then we're doing something else.

1116
02:23:52,489 --> 02:24:00,760
Why are you doing that?

1117
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:09,719
Why are you just doing this on flag?

1118
02:24:09,719 --> 02:24:11,239
No, this is where you want me to click.

1119
02:24:11,879 --> 02:24:13,879
How do you flag?

1120
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:14,840
Okay, it's right click.

1121
02:24:44,579 --> 02:24:45,079
Flag.

1122
02:24:46,709 --> 02:24:49,430
No, you have to click where you want me to click.

1123
02:24:49,430 --> 02:24:51,829
Not click where you want me to place a flag.

1124
02:24:51,829 --> 02:24:56,940
All right, moving on to chess.

1125
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:15,430
Okay, we're in cool math games and this is chess.

1126
02:25:15,430 --> 02:25:21,430
I think we're about to play versus another computer.

1127
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:22,629
Random opponent?

1128
02:25:22,629 --> 02:25:28,250
Oh no, this doesn't work.

1129
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:32,100
No, me versus you guys.

1130
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:34,040
Play a friend.

1131
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:36,200
Minutes per side, like three, two.

1132
02:25:37,959 --> 02:25:39,000
Increment in seconds.

1133
02:25:39,719 --> 02:25:40,200
Who cares?

1134
02:25:43,079 --> 02:25:44,440
Choose your color.

1135
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:46,760
I'm just gonna, we'll just do the default ones.

1136
02:25:50,340 --> 02:25:53,219
If your friend gave you a, wait, I can't do it.

1137
02:25:53,219 --> 02:25:54,340
That's like a friend code.

1138
02:25:58,360 --> 02:25:59,959
All right, guys, this is what we're gonna do.

1139
02:26:03,739 --> 02:26:05,899
We have to beat a level eight computer.

1140
02:26:05,899 --> 02:26:20,520
Are you guys up for the challenge?

1141
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:36,149
I wonder.

1142
02:26:36,149 --> 02:26:44,440
Okay, let's get that nice and stretched so you guys can puke.

1143
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:47,639
Level eight and let's just pick, what does this matter?

1144
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:52,299
Let's go start.

1145
02:26:52,299 --> 02:26:55,350
Well, that's not correct.

1146
02:26:55,350 --> 02:26:57,510
All right, wait, do we have time here?

1147
02:26:57,510 --> 02:27:03,260
Is this timed?

1148
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:08,139
All right, you ready?

1149
02:27:08,139 --> 02:27:08,860
Pick it.

1150
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:10,299
Where are we starting?

1151
02:27:10,299 --> 02:27:15,799
This is the hardest computer in the entire world.

1152
02:27:15,799 --> 02:27:23,780
Pretty unanimous, okay?

1153
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:31,450
And where's it going?

1154
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:32,170
Which space?

1155
02:27:32,170 --> 02:27:38,229
The first or the second?

1156
02:27:38,229 --> 02:27:39,030
I'm zoomed in.

1157
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:41,190
I'm enhanced as much as I can get enhanced here.

1158
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:42,069
Which one is it?

1159
02:27:42,069 --> 02:27:56,329
Am I gonna have to do it again?

1160
02:27:56,329 --> 02:27:57,129
E3.

1161
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:10,250
I gotta enhance it a little bit.

1162
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:15,540
I can't tell.

1163
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:19,719
You guys don't need the E's or the 3's.

1164
02:28:19,719 --> 02:28:21,559
But we need to see the board.

1165
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:24,579
Okay, do it again.

1166
02:28:24,579 --> 02:28:25,219
Come on.

1167
02:28:25,219 --> 02:28:26,260
Get it right this time, guys.

1168
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:27,379
Come on.

1169
02:28:27,379 --> 02:28:28,579
I know you got it in you.

1170
02:28:28,579 --> 02:28:32,860
That's a little more clear.

1171
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:34,459
Make sure you're clicking like in the box, though.

1172
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:40,819
I'm not, I don't know what that is, but I'm not gonna do that.

1173
02:28:40,819 --> 02:28:44,280
We're going here.

1174
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:45,079
Okay?

1175
02:28:45,079 --> 02:28:51,180
Which one?

1176
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:51,579
Again?

1177
02:28:51,579 --> 02:29:08,860
You want to meet and root the pawn again?

1178
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:10,219
Uh, all right.

1179
02:29:10,219 --> 02:29:10,700
Hold on.

1180
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:19,420
Now, I'm not going to that website.

1181
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:24,200
Come on, guys.

1182
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:31,270
So we are at almost a thousand participants.

1183
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:34,229
Looks like we're going with this guy here.

1184
02:29:34,229 --> 02:29:46,040
Is that the case?

1185
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:46,840
All right.

1186
02:29:46,840 --> 02:29:54,139
Where's it going?

1187
02:29:54,139 --> 02:29:54,860
Right to the front.

1188
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:56,860
This could take us like four hours.

1189
02:29:56,860 --> 02:30:09,989
This isn't Nickelodeon.

1190
02:30:09,989 --> 02:30:10,709
I know.

1191
02:30:10,709 --> 02:30:14,299
This is not even close to Nickelodeon.

1192
02:30:14,299 --> 02:30:15,020
I think it's here.

1193
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:16,540
There's most clicks are here.

1194
02:30:16,540 --> 02:30:21,909
All right, which one?

1195
02:30:32,469 --> 02:30:36,299
Play Civilization like this?

1196
02:30:36,299 --> 02:30:38,020
No way.

1197
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:40,500
Chess on its own is difficult enough.

1198
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:52,540
Speaking of difficult, this isn't too close to call.

1199
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:57,579
Well, no, not anymore.

1200
02:30:57,579 --> 02:30:58,940
Play Starcraft.

1201
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:01,879
All right, we're going with this one.

1202
02:31:03,129 --> 02:31:04,809
And we can only do one thing, right?

1203
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:08,379
Only one thing is available.

1204
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:20,899
All right.

1205
02:31:20,899 --> 02:31:21,540
Now what?

1206
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:30,950
Would you want me to move?

1207
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:33,270
I can't move that horse.

1208
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:49,690
We already lost close the game.

1209
02:31:49,690 --> 02:31:50,649
Give us Nickelodeon.

1210
02:31:50,649 --> 02:31:51,530
This is too easy.

1211
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:52,569
Twitch Prime, Jarmo.

1212
02:31:52,569 --> 02:31:54,889
When are we playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, man?

1213
02:31:55,610 --> 02:32:00,549
I was going to play it tonight.

1214
02:32:00,549 --> 02:32:02,309
All right, we're going from here.

1215
02:32:02,309 --> 02:32:03,670
And one or two spaces.

1216
02:32:10,979 --> 02:32:12,020
Go for the king.

1217
02:32:14,969 --> 02:32:16,170
I can't go that far.

1218
02:32:25,180 --> 02:32:32,979
So many people are trying to click the X on the corner.

1219
02:32:32,979 --> 02:32:34,739
All right, we're going one step up.

1220
02:32:34,739 --> 02:32:40,440
All right.

1221
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:41,959
They brought another horse out.

1222
02:32:41,959 --> 02:32:43,159
What's your move, guys?

1223
02:32:43,159 --> 02:32:47,540
Which one?

1224
02:32:47,540 --> 02:32:48,100
Down here.

1225
02:32:51,530 --> 02:32:53,049
Even more people.

1226
02:32:53,049 --> 02:32:59,459
Looks like you want to take the horse.

1227
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:05,030
All right.

1228
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:06,840
Where's it going?

1229
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:25,510
From one of three spaces there.

1230
02:33:25,510 --> 02:33:26,069
Here we go.

1231
02:33:26,069 --> 02:33:26,549
Let's do it.

1232
02:33:30,409 --> 02:33:32,170
Are we checkmated right now?

1233
02:33:32,170 --> 02:33:34,649
Hold on.

1234
02:33:34,649 --> 02:33:35,209
Did I lose?

1235
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:42,139
Where do I take him?

1236
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:44,979
What?

1237
02:33:44,979 --> 02:33:48,520
I have to move here.

1238
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:49,239
Okay.

1239
02:33:49,239 --> 02:33:51,239
I'm in check again.

1240
02:33:51,239 --> 02:33:52,280
What did you guys do?

1241
02:33:52,840 --> 02:34:06,739
Where am I taking him?

1242
02:34:06,739 --> 02:34:08,100
Oh, so that's it.

1243
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:08,579
That's it.

1244
02:34:08,579 --> 02:34:09,379
Game over.

1245
02:34:09,379 --> 02:34:13,100
That's checkmate.

1246
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:13,340
That's it.

1247
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:23,379
It's over.

1248
02:34:23,379 --> 02:34:26,100
You...

1249
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:27,139
That's checkmate.

1250
02:34:27,139 --> 02:34:27,700
That's it.

1251
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,100
I lose.

1252
02:34:40,489 --> 02:34:42,649
Somebody just said, Jarmo, why are you so bad?

1253
02:34:45,049 --> 02:34:47,530
I didn't do anything.

1254
02:34:49,750 --> 02:34:51,510
Let's play some mini clip games.

1255
02:34:51,510 --> 02:34:57,270
Let me at least do the thing that's in the title.

1256
02:34:57,270 --> 02:34:58,870
It's streamer's choice right now.

1257
02:34:58,870 --> 02:35:05,700
All right.

1258
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:06,500
Streamer's choice.

1259
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:12,540
The real question is what do I want to play?

1260
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:23,219
Oh, there's so many options.

1261
02:35:23,219 --> 02:35:24,500
I need you guys to pick for me.

1262
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:25,540
No, I got it.

1263
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:27,209
I don't need anybody to pick for me.

1264
02:35:27,209 --> 02:35:29,219
I'm going right here.

1265
02:35:29,219 --> 02:35:31,559
Hopefully this is not loud.

1266
02:35:31,559 --> 02:35:32,280
It's going to be though.

1267
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:33,159
I know it is.

1268
02:35:33,159 --> 02:35:40,569
All right.

1269
02:35:40,569 --> 02:35:43,610
You want to see how to lose like 500 viewers instantly?

1270
02:36:05,020 --> 02:36:06,219
Wait, wait, wait.

1271
02:36:06,219 --> 02:36:07,500
Let me just do this.

1272
02:36:07,500 --> 02:36:08,379
I want to play this one.

1273
02:36:24,649 --> 02:36:24,969
Yeah.

1274
02:36:24,969 --> 02:36:26,329
Not Nickelodeon.

1275
02:36:26,329 --> 02:36:28,899
Not even close to Nickelodeon.

1276
02:36:28,899 --> 02:36:33,350
Is there a Nickelodeon baseball show?

1277
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:36,329
All right.

1278
02:36:36,329 --> 02:36:36,729
I'm ready.

1279
02:36:43,430 --> 02:37:05,940
You have 10 pitches to score as many points as possible.

1280
02:37:05,940 --> 02:37:06,739
How do you play?

1281
02:37:06,739 --> 02:37:10,329
As the pitcher winds up, a marker appears showing where the ball will pass.

1282
02:37:12,659 --> 02:37:15,639
Use the mouse to mouse the aim circle towards the marker.

1283
02:37:15,639 --> 02:37:16,840
The closer you are, the straighter you're hit.

1284
02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:17,479
OK.

1285
02:37:17,479 --> 02:37:24,389
You can control the direction by moving the aim circle relative to the marker.

1286
02:37:24,389 --> 02:37:24,629
OK.

1287
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:25,989
Hit the ball.

1288
02:37:26,549 --> 02:37:27,270
Up aim.

1289
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:28,229
That's up.

1290
02:37:28,229 --> 02:37:28,549
Down.

1291
02:37:28,549 --> 02:37:29,909
And set the ground ball.

1292
02:37:29,909 --> 02:37:32,309
Click the left mouse button to swing.

1293
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:35,879
Land the ball as close as you can to the center for the target.

1294
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:36,440
Oh, god.

1295
02:37:44,569 --> 02:37:45,129
Oh, shit.

1296
02:37:45,129 --> 02:37:53,989
We're losing viewers.

1297
02:37:53,989 --> 02:37:54,709
Get out of here.

1298
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:04,840
It's gone.

1299
02:38:08,899 --> 02:38:10,180
I got to hit a home run.

1300
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:12,250
That's a home run.

1301
02:38:12,250 --> 02:38:19,829
I'll turn the game off.

1302
02:38:19,829 --> 02:38:21,350
Winnie the Pooh baseball.

1303
02:38:21,350 --> 02:38:22,659
I tried that before.

1304
02:38:30,409 --> 02:38:31,850
I got points on that one.

1305
02:38:31,850 --> 02:38:32,250
A lot.

1306
02:38:43,819 --> 02:38:48,139
I did already play Winnie the Pooh baseball, though.

1307
02:38:48,139 --> 02:38:51,020
You're right.

1308
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:51,659
Oh, fuck.

1309
02:38:51,659 --> 02:38:52,459
I crashed it.

1310
02:38:52,459 --> 02:38:54,139
No, I didn't.

1311
02:38:54,139 --> 02:38:58,309
I just right-clicked accidentally.

1312
02:38:58,309 --> 02:38:58,709
Get out.

1313
02:38:59,909 --> 02:39:00,389
I need to.

1314
02:39:00,389 --> 02:39:03,500
I can't leave until I hit a home run.

1315
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:03,979
I can't.

1316
02:39:12,100 --> 02:39:12,819
Get out.

1317
02:39:12,819 --> 02:39:20,280
No, no, no.

1318
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:21,000
I'm doing it again.

1319
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:24,659
Okay, let's go.

1320
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:26,899
High scores.

1321
02:39:26,899 --> 02:39:27,700
I don't...

1322
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:28,100
No.

1323
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:28,659
Main menu.

1324
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:33,110
Easy.

1325
02:39:42,090 --> 02:39:43,049
Fucking get out.

1326
02:39:55,639 --> 02:39:56,360
Oh, my god.

1327
02:39:56,360 --> 02:39:57,079
I'm never going to do it.

1328
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:06,569
That's gone.

1329
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:23,270
I don't think it's possible to hit a home run.

1330
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:34,379
You can't hit a home run in this game.

1331
02:40:35,799 --> 02:40:38,940
Why?

1332
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:40,459
Oh, that's what he says.

1333
02:40:40,459 --> 02:40:42,920
And it didn't fucking leave the infield.

1334
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:43,399
I'm out of here.

1335
02:41:15,290 --> 02:41:17,129
A ball out of the fucking infield.

1336
02:41:19,850 --> 02:41:25,530
Get out of the infield.

1337
02:41:25,530 --> 02:41:26,170
I can run?

1338
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:32,149
Oh, my god.

1339
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:42,090
No, get out.

1340
02:41:51,399 --> 02:41:52,520
Okay, good, good.

1341
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:53,559
Okay, okay, okay.

1342
02:41:53,559 --> 02:41:54,200
We're good.

1343
02:41:54,200 --> 02:42:10,659
All right, maybe I'll get those 300 people that left back.

1344
02:42:10,659 --> 02:42:13,110
Let chat play balloons.

1345
02:42:13,110 --> 02:42:14,069
Tower defense.

1346
02:42:14,069 --> 02:42:22,340
You guys want to play balloons?

1347
02:42:31,399 --> 02:42:42,299
You play balloons.

1348
02:42:42,299 --> 02:42:43,180
Don't...

1349
02:42:43,180 --> 02:42:44,540
Normal balloons.

1350
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:50,379
No, how about this?

1351
02:42:50,379 --> 02:42:53,819
I want to find one of these that I think is cool.

1352
02:42:53,819 --> 02:42:54,860
This one looks cool.

1353
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:56,139
I'm going to do this one first.

1354
02:42:56,139 --> 02:42:58,489
This one's called saloon brawl.

1355
02:42:58,489 --> 02:43:15,860
I need to move it.

1356
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:24,680
That doesn't sound good.

1357
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:26,120
That sounds really bad, actually.

1358
02:43:26,120 --> 02:43:34,940
It sounds like my speakers don't work.

1359
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:45,000
Okay, now let's make it fit the screen.

1360
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:48,149
Saloon brawl.

1361
02:43:48,149 --> 02:43:57,590
All right, let's go.

1362
02:43:57,590 --> 02:43:58,469
Oh, my god.

1363
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:10,579
Grab, punch, block, grab foes.

1364
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:32,090
This is a pretty good iPad game.

1365
02:44:32,090 --> 02:44:33,129
Oh, that guy's got a pizza.

1366
02:44:33,690 --> 02:44:39,500
Special attack is ready.

1367
02:44:40,059 --> 02:44:41,100
How do I do my special?

1368
02:44:49,219 --> 02:44:50,420
Oh, my fucking god.

1369
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:55,399
How do you win this?

1370
02:45:13,479 --> 02:45:14,360
Get them all in the water.

1371
02:45:15,299 --> 02:45:16,340
What the heck am I doing?

1372
02:45:20,329 --> 02:45:21,610
Just throw them all in the water.

1373
02:45:24,979 --> 02:45:26,500
This is the stupidest thing ever.

1374
02:45:32,629 --> 02:45:35,110
Fortnite Season 7 incoming.

1375
02:45:35,670 --> 02:45:53,540
I got to at least beat the first level.

1376
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:58,469
Step on his head.

1377
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:02,520
I win.

1378
02:46:03,239 --> 02:46:04,360
Thank god.

1379
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:04,840
It's over.

1380
02:46:05,479 --> 02:46:07,750
Is it over?

1381
02:46:08,469 --> 02:46:10,790
No, there's one more guy with the fucking pizza.

1382
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:24,629
I did it.

1383
02:46:25,899 --> 02:46:27,020
All knocked out.

1384
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:27,420
I win.

1385
02:46:28,139 --> 02:46:51,500
Like, that's enough of that.

1386
02:46:51,500 --> 02:46:52,780
There's so many things here.

1387
02:46:57,799 --> 02:46:59,239
We can still hear it from your mic.

1388
02:46:59,239 --> 02:47:00,440
That's how loud that shit is.

1389
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:01,799
I'm going to go to sleep.

1390
02:47:01,799 --> 02:47:02,360
I'm going to go to sleep.

1391
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:02,840
I'm going to go to sleep.

1392
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:03,000
I'm going to go to sleep.

1393
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:03,159
I'm going to go to sleep.

1394
02:47:03,159 --> 02:47:03,239
I'm going to go to sleep.

1395
02:47:03,239 --> 02:47:03,319
I'm going to go to sleep.

1396
02:47:03,319 --> 02:47:03,399
I'm going to go to sleep.

1397
02:47:03,399 --> 02:47:03,479
I'm going to go to sleep.

1398
02:47:03,479 --> 02:47:03,559
I'm going to go to sleep.

1399
02:47:03,559 --> 02:47:03,639
I'm going to go to sleep.

1400
02:47:03,639 --> 02:47:03,719
I'm going to go to sleep.

1401
02:47:03,719 --> 02:47:03,799
I'm going to go to sleep.

1402
02:47:03,799 --> 02:47:03,879
I'm going to go to sleep.

1403
02:47:03,879 --> 02:47:03,959
I'm going to go to sleep.

1404
02:47:03,959 --> 02:47:04,040
I'm going to go to sleep.

1405
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:04,200
I'm going to go to sleep.

1406
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:04,280
I'm going to go to sleep.

1407
02:47:04,280 --> 02:47:04,360
I'm going to go to sleep.

1408
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:04,440
I'm going to go to sleep.

1409
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:04,520
I'm going to go to sleep.
