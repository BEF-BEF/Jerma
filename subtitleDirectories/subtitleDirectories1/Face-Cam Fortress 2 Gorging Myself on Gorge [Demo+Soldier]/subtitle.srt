00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:17,019
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2, Facecam Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.

2
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:28,879
That's a lot of words. This is episode 1 of Facecam Fortress 2. Well, technically not episode 1, but it's episode probably like 4 or 5.

3
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,879
Heavy, you're gonna kill me and soldier behind me.

4
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:40,060
Episode 1 of probably 500,000. I'm gonna do this every Monday and every Saturday, and they'll be uploaded around the same time.

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:58,259
So expect a FCF2, Facecam Fortress 2, FCF2 video every Monday and Saturday at 1pm Eastern time. Standard. And that is, no, it's not a spy. Is it? No, it's not.

6
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:06,500
This is the Demoman with the default. Pretty much everything except for the halfs of Toichi. And this is on gorge. Let's gorge ourselves on gorge.

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:19,260
I thought that was a spy. I wasted it. Somebody come up there. Anybody? Anybody? Ooh, Heavy. Please don't kill me, Heavy. Don't come up the stairs. I don't want to die.

8
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:24,319
Heavy? Sniper.

9
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,620
My name is still Abrum. I didn't mean for that to be there, really.

10
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,379
I just got a couple of good kills. And...

11
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:42,379
Oh my god, I killed him. Oh my god, he was just standing in the corner.

12
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:46,989
Maybe this Heavy will not know I'm behind him. Or this Batic.

13
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:49,989
Oh my god, that was so unfair.

14
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:58,049
Oh my god. Does that guy have a bootlegger?

15
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:17,810
I need a Medic. Do we have any? No, we don't. We don't have one Medic. Maybe I'll change that after... Oh no.

16
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,110
Thank you Pyro for saving my life. It doesn't matter though, I'm going to die right here anyways.

17
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,110
I forgot to mention this because I was screwing this on before the video started. Well, not that I forgot to mention it, but...

18
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,110
You want to see the vitamins that I take? This is actually pretty funny.

19
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,110
So, Centrum Silver. I don't know if the camera is going to go out of focus, but Centrum Silvers.

20
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:45,789
Take a look at the age. 50 plus. I got to take 50 year old vitamins. Well, 50 plus.

21
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:50,789
And that's because of my Crohn's disease. I got to take old people vitamins.

22
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,099
For Grandma. Grandpa should be taking those, not me.

23
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:02,620
But it's because old people don't have as good absorption of nutrients into their intestines, I think it is.

24
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,919
And my intestines are a little bit on the slow side, because of course I have Crohn's.

25
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:13,419
But yeah, I thought that was funny. My mother showed those to me. She's like, these are the vitamins you got to take.

26
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:32,259
I was like, I do? That's a three piece. Oh, bump into that. How did I crit him? Oh, someone's behind me.

27
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:41,240
Or are they?

28
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,860
Soldier with direct hits scares me a little. Nah.

29
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,740
I had a feeling he was going to kill me. I had a feeling.

30
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
You know what? Where are my cough drops? I want one right now.

31
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:01,180
Ricola. Do I have enough time? I got plenty of time.

32
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,620
Oh, I got plenty of spies. Timing up and backstabbing scumbags like you. No offense.

33
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,669
If you manage to kill them, I assure you, they will not like spies.

34
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,560
Who the hell am I doing? I think we're going to win. They're not even at the first point.

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,259
Oh, he's going to charge shot me. Actually, you know why I said that?

36
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:33,259
I've been watching a lot of those YouTube poops of Team Fortress where they replace the sentences.

37
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:39,430
So like the scout will say something like this, like, oh, I kill plenty of birds, a diamond bird, birds, like you birds.

38
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,990
Like, I can't really replicate it, but it's very, very funny.

39
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,420
We win. We're going to win.

40
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:56,100
I never know what to do with myself after I die. I come just like, I could just sit here.

41
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,730
I could model. There's a fly right in front of here.

42
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:08,060
Do you guys see that? Fly bastard. Hope he lands right in my mouth.

43
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:22,870
I do not hope that. Gotta get on the point. Slow walk to the first point in Gorge.

44
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:30,449
Oh, come on. Smash. Smash. Come on. Get him off.

45
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:47,629
What the hell? Who is this soldier? There we go. Anybody else? Here we go. Cool.

46
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:56,620
Alrighty. Alrighty then. Let's do another one. He's not a threat.

47
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,920
How did I not kill that guy? How did I still not kill that guy? Oh my God.

48
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,189
All right. I made up for it because I smashed that guy in his teeth.

49
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:20,300
I can't believe I didn't kill that guy. Crit rocket. Medic? That's a spy probably.

50
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,939
I guess not. The way he jerked away. I could have sworn he was a spy.

51
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:42,240
Buff banner. Crush him baby. Smash. Somebody kill him. Somebody kill that guy.

52
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:54,589
Pop. Doctor, I require assistance. And that is going to be a cap right there.

53
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:58,970
I don't even want to be a part of it. I want to be forward. Forward motion.

54
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:11,490
We got engineer and you. Oh, you are a slippery one. I can't go up there right now.

55
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:26,339
Where's that medic? Medic my friend, where did you go? It's okay. I'm good.

56
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm good. I'm not even going to need the banner. Maybe we will.

57
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,089
There's going to be a lot of dudes down here. There we go. There we go.

58
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:52,139
All right guys. That's going to wrap it up for episode one of ten hundred million thousand face cam fortress 2.

59
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,560
So I'll see you guys all next time and take care everybody.

60
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,000
Otto! He's not even here.
