1
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:17,850
Okay, I'm back. It's time to switch to a scary game. It is October. We played Scorn

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:39,020
a few days ago. What should I title this? It's Deadly Night. What do I title this? How about um...

3
00:00:41,829 --> 00:01:04,709
Look Out. Watch Out. Uh, I don't know. You want me to title the name of my stream? Play Scorn.

4
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:19,799
I'm not gonna do that. Um, I believe I just turned on my Xbox. I may have. I'm not sure yet.

5
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:30,459
Doesn't look like it, but I could have. All right. Uh, Halloween Approaches. Ghost.

6
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:52,659
I don't know. How about just like, You Scared. Yeah, You Scared. You're safe. You're safe in the

7
00:01:52,659 --> 00:02:14,819
comments. Yeah. The smiley face. You're safe in the comments. You don't remember that? That's not-

8
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:40,120
You don't like that one? I'm keeping it. All right. Let's go. Oh, lights off. You're right. Hold on.

9
00:02:40,120 --> 00:03:08,250
Nobody even said it. I just did though. This is not Vampire Survivors. Yeah. Lights off. Creepy.

10
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:21,509
Sorry I'm like stalling really bad, but it's a scary game and I fucking hate these. You know me.

11
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:36,729
I know. I hate these. I hate it. I hate these games. I don't know why I just screamed. It's way too

12
00:03:36,729 --> 00:04:21,930
bright. This is kind of scary. All right. I like this. This is scary. What do you think? Also,

13
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:32,579
let me know. Let me know if it's- if this shit's still happening. Webcam glitching. Because it

14
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:45,689
really shouldn't be. How's that? Are we good? Does it look- does it look scary? I think that looks

15
00:04:45,689 --> 00:05:08,149
all right. Very spooky. Good? Maybe a little bit more bright? Just a little bit? I think that's

16
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:14,230
good. Yeah, this is perfect. All right. I'm ready. Lights off. Deadly night. No more stalling. It's

17
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:29,860
time to fucking go. I'm ready. This game contains nudity. Uh, did I? I don't know. I want to censor

18
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,000
the nudity. I mean, it's asking me if I want to censor it. Is it TOS? Anybody played this yet?

19
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Other people have played with it on? Okay. It's part of the game. Other people have played with

20
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:03,959
it on. Uh, I mean, is it- how- is it really- means- okay, honest to god, let me just tell you.

21
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:13,579
If- if I could show scorn, the- if I could show scorn, I- I don't think- I think it's- I don't

22
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:23,910
know. I think it's gonna be okay. Motel? The house? Susan 9-1-1 call. I don't know. Is it like- is

23
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,670
sent- is it like- like a big black bar? Is it gonna take me out of the game? I don't know what

24
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:54,009
it- what that means, but whatever. Jesus Christ, dude. What the fuck? Where are you going?

25
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:54,569
Where am I going?

26
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:39,269
Are you sure I look good?

27
00:07:51,879 --> 00:08:03,860
Where are we going? Is this gonna be loud?

28
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,000
Is this game- is this game scary? Tell me the truth.

29
00:08:47,769 --> 00:09:05,320
You're welcome. Okay. Okay, whatever. Okay, I've got run inventory. Pause. Crouch flashlight.

30
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:19,620
Look around. No, we're not doing gamepad. All right, so there we go. I have an inventory.

31
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:34,820
Is it me? Stop. My- I'm so- I'm so jumpy right now, too. I don't know why. I don't want any

32
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:54,309
drinks. Motel. Highway. Motel. Single room $20, double room $40. It is mandatory to pay in advance

33
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:59,190
and leave the room before $12. If you do not have phones in the rooms, the only phone available is

34
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:06,549
at the reception. Talk to the person in charge for more info. Like, grenades? Why do you have

35
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:36,220
a bunch of grenades? My cam's not on the edge of the screen. Oops. Okay, so, um, I guess I can't

36
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:44,149
do anything in here. I can't play this tonight. I actually don't think I can. I'm so fucked up

37
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,789
today. You know what I mean? I'm super, like, hmm.

38
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:11,559
I see. The bus usually arrives at 8 a.m. I can let you know an hour earlier if you wish.

39
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:27,299
Um, sure. It would be perfect, thanks. Are you coming with someone? I'm alone, but I want a

40
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:42,710
double room. Many people come here to have sex. Is it your case? What the fuck do you care?

41
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:54,679
I care. I'm sure you're great at wiggling that ass, right? Do you like sex from the front,

42
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:12,059
back, or both? I will not say here. Fuck you. Yeah, I'm sorry. Fuck you. Who the fuck is this guy?

43
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:45,179
Crash. It stinks. It seemed to be pretty dirty. Door number one, door number two.

44
00:12:45,980 --> 00:13:12,580
Do I have to, wait, do I have to get a room? I, okay. I think I have to just demand a room.

45
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:24,440
I think we're, we need game progress here. While you're playing this and not stay out of the house,

46
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:31,059
I will be playing stay out of the house. Just not right this very moment. I will. It's on the list

47
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,049
of games to play in the next week or two. I guess I have to get a room or something. I have to get

48
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:48,899
a room. I can't just, all right, well. Have you had second? A young girl like you shouldn't be out

49
00:13:48,899 --> 00:14:03,879
there alone at this hour. Okay. Give me the fucking room. Give me a room. What door is this?

50
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:29,299
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, number eight. Are you lost? School. All right. Eight was

51
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:59,509
right. Okay. Use. Turn the light on quick. I need to lock the door, right? Like where's the door lock?

52
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:27,610
That's scary. Is this a bathroom? Yeah, turn every light on so all the spirits can't get in here.

53
00:15:30,360 --> 00:16:05,960
Oh my God. I hate this. Yeah. Why is it automatically put on like a horror channel?

54
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:47,179
Uh, okay. What kind of TV channel is this? Let's, can we break this down for one second?

55
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:56,840
This is a scary sound effect channel. It's just creepy noises, scary music.

56
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,019
What is this? Why is this on TV? I'm not putting that on. All right. I'm sleeping with all the

57
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:31,289
lights on. Every single light is being turned on. Uh, oh, the door is stuck.

58
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,609
Water. Water from the sink. Water. Smash the window. Glass is too hot. Uh, break something.

59
00:17:37,609 --> 00:18:01,849
Hit something. Um, TV. Door's stuck. Go, go, go, go, go. What the? What does that say?

60
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,829
My God. That's a nightmare. I'm gonna scream in my face. We're gonna get ready for a scream in my

61
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:39,029
mouth. That nightmare. Right now I don't need the backpack. I can hear a noise in the room. I should

62
00:18:39,029 --> 00:20:28,250
see what it is. What is this noise? Today's August 17, 1987. What does it say? 911, what is your

63
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:34,250
emergency? I'm at the highway motel. The owner is a sicko. I've discovered hidden cameras behind the

64
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:41,880
mirrors in my room. They were recording. Don't worry. I'll send a patrol car. The area is quite

65
00:20:41,880 --> 00:21:41,339
remote and it will take some time to get there. So please be patient. Okay. Um, okay. Okay. All

66
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:51,400
right. Backspace. Backspace. I don't want. How do I get out of this TV? Does he make porn movies

67
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,480
by filming? I also appear in the recording. I heard the door open. Hey, what are you doing here?

68
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,900
I have discovered your secrets. You sick. I've already called the police and they're on their

69
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:15,099
way. You're going to end up behind bars. Oh, the police. I don't think so. You're going to stay

70
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:25,019
locked in here until I decide what to do with you. And maybe I'll fuck that sweet hairy pussy.

71
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,730
What the fuck? Just trashed the TV on his head. It's Matt. I got to fucking hit with the TV.

72
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:46,230
I have to fucking kill this guy. What the fuck? What is laughing? Oh, it's this.

73
00:22:46,789 --> 00:23:15,640
If only I had a coin. Do I have a coin? This is fucked. Do I have a coin? I don't have a coin.

74
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:53,660
Okay. Go back to the room and get my backpack. Oh, come on. You know, I didn't have anything

75
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:08,730
important. I can. Was this car here before? Was this car here before? Was this actually here before?

76
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:45,799
I don't think it was. I'm staying right in the middle. A car comes. I, it won't hit me. I mean,

77
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:55,140
right in the center. They're going to pull some bullshit with it. A cop car is going to be flying

78
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:06,410
down here. No, I'm going over here. Why is that music? How come I touch that music starts? Oh my

79
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:48,470
God. You're going to reverse. Oh God. Oh, I heard something. I'm going back. I'm going back. I'm

80
00:25:48,470 --> 00:26:06,940
going back. I'm going back. I'm going. I'm going back. I'm going back to the hotel. Get off the

81
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:25,529
road. Should I go back to the motel? I'm going to go back and get the backpack because he's driving

82
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:43,369
that way and he has not turned around yet. He hasn't turned around yet. It's invisible. Well,

83
00:26:43,369 --> 00:27:02,069
I can't. Is he still just parked in the middle of the street? Honestly, I'm going here and like

84
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:54,569
get down in like the weeds and shit. Oh God damn it. Shit. God damn it. If I keep my eye on him,

85
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:31,990
then he can't get me. What happened? Why did you stop? Why did you stop? Why did you stop the car?

86
00:28:31,990 --> 00:29:52,869
Why did you stop the car? Can you beat it? Can you beat this? Like, can you win? The murderer's

87
00:29:52,869 --> 00:30:53,029
house. Oh, oh, there are four acts. Okay. I hate this. Okay. I got up. Oh God. What is this? Turn

88
00:30:53,029 --> 00:31:20,680
it on. Turn it on. Oh, how do I use it? No, no. Where the fuck is this? I have to get out of here.

89
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:39,319
Oh my God. Can't turn it. I don't know the combination. All right. I need to know the

90
00:31:39,319 --> 00:32:09,369
combination. Can I hide in this? There's so many places to go. You can hide under tables,

91
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:24,869
beds, and in some furniture. I got to practice that. How do you do that? Crouch. I can crouch.

92
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:58,759
This door is locked. How can I get out? There's nothing to hide under.

93
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:30,470
I'm alive. I'm alive. Spider. Oh my God, dude. Where do I even go? What do I do?

94
00:33:38,069 --> 00:34:22,409
No, no, no, dude. I don't know where to go. How do I? Home? Rust remover. I can't reach it. There's

95
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:45,750
something in there. Dude, how do you hide? How do I hide? Oh, wait. Where the fuck am I? Am I? Where am

96
00:34:45,750 --> 00:35:29,539
I? Am I hiding? Where am I? I want to play the Batman game again. I want to ride around and

97
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:45,099
protect Gotham City. He's right out here and I'm gonna, I'm gonna walk right into him when I get

98
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:58,980
out of here and I have like one slash and I'm dead. Where is he going? Okay, this is, somebody make

99
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:15,130
this into a poster for a horror movie. Honest to God, somebody needs to turn this into a poster.

100
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:24,900
Like, with the title, like, you're not getting out or something, right? What is the title of

101
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:49,219
this movie, do you think? You tell me. My eyes are all red. Why do I look so fucked up? Holy shit,

102
00:36:49,219 --> 00:37:21,449
man. This is fucked. I look like Voldemort. Oh, this is a screen cap from Dumb and Dumber.

103
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:54,869
I hope people AI expand that one. I hope so too. He's right. He won't leave. Just leave me alone.

104
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:33,400
Rust remover. Yeah, you can see through that knob doesn't turn. Maybe I can use something to make us

105
00:38:33,400 --> 00:39:09,690
make the psycho pull it down. Bandage. How do I use this? How do I use the bandage? Is there a save?

106
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:29,260
Hide in the box and shimmy out. That actually could probably work. I hate this game. I hate

107
00:39:29,260 --> 00:40:05,239
this. Right here. Okay, so I have rust remover. Something was rusty. Sink was rusty. Sink was

108
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:15,980
rusty. You know what? Scared. That's what you want. I'm gonna march out here and just start singing

109
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:26,179
fucking John Jingleheimer Schmidt. What are you doing? No, you're supposed to be scared.

110
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:33,980
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. His name is my name too. Whenever we go out,

111
00:40:34,940 --> 00:41:06,860
we always shout. Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. Get in the bathtub quick.

112
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:15,719
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt. His name is my name too. Whenever I go out,

113
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,079
the people always shout. Here comes John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.

114
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:37,659
Where is he? Dude, I can't see anything. Break this door. Break this door. Break this door,

115
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:48,760
dude. This game is fucked. This game is fucked up. That's wicked funny. We got to see this one.

116
00:41:48,760 --> 00:42:05,179
This one's perfect. I don't want to play this. I hate this. This is a good one though. Wait,

117
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:26,969
come on, come on, come on. Why can I not save this? This one is so good. This is fucking actually

118
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:37,750
one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I have to get these on stream. I have to. Okay,

119
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:48,730
well, everyone bear with me for a second. I got to get these all loaded because these are gold.

120
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:58,940
These are actual gold. Here's the first one. This one's pretty good, I will say. This one's

121
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:13,340
pretty good. They get better. They get way better. And I mean, way better. This one,

122
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,300
um, apparently, so an AI decided that this is what I was doing. Okay, makes sense, right?

123
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:44,329
Why would I be this concerned? Here's the next one. I, dinner, I'm making dinner and I'm very,

124
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:59,590
this is an oven that I'm shocked at. But wait, it's not even the best one because the best one

125
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:04,469
is right here. And it could be the funniest image I've seen ever on the channel. And I mean that.

126
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:08,139
This is probably the funniest thing. This is probably the funniest image that's come through.

127
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:36,550
This is so good. Look at how bad that form is too. It's so bad. This is like the old guy.

128
00:44:37,940 --> 00:45:06,059
This kind of has to like stay. Okay, retry. How far am I in the game? Not even fucking close,

129
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:13,929
dude. I don't think I'm going to beat this. Close the door. Close the door. Close the door.

130
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:29,019
I can't close it. Is it open? I don't think I'm going to be able to do this. I don't think I can

131
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:49,800
play this game. Trying to commit this house to memory and he's wicked fast. I need to get items

132
00:45:49,800 --> 00:46:01,079
and shit. No way. I'm not going to be able to beat this. I'm going to panic every time he shows

133
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:16,099
up. Was there an item down here? No, it's back up in the house. All right. This is a good one,

134
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:23,079
too. I'm going to show this one. This is also a really good one. I kind of just want to like

135
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:30,230
do this for the rest of the stream. This is fun. Apparently like very, very, very excited at the

136
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:44,760
birthday party. I'm very surprised at my surprise birthday party. What do I have my arm? What am

137
00:46:44,760 --> 00:47:06,949
I holding? Is that like a clipboard or an iPad? One more and I'm going to move on. These are very

138
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:29,380
good though. They're very good. I feel like chats is going to be chat's favorite. I can't play. I

139
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:34,309
can't play this game. Okay. I'm going to just be quiet. I'm going to shut up and I'm even if it's

140
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,590
scary, I'm just going to go and I'm going to play it. I don't care. Fucking come get me. I don't

141
00:47:37,590 --> 00:48:38,010
care. I can't. I quit. This is the first time I've ever quitting a game. How do I get out of here?

142
00:48:38,010 --> 00:49:22,920
I can't hide under the table. Oh, Bugleberry radio. I wish we would just go away for even five

143
00:49:22,920 --> 00:50:07,980
minutes. He's just camping me. You know what? I feel like I'm playing and it's a game I never

144
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:18,570
beat and I just rage quit it. I was just, I scare rage quit it. That grandma game for iPad. I

145
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:48,010
couldn't do it and I was like, I'm just fucking uninstalling this. Oh, we're in a circle.

146
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:57,860
That was the chicken. That was a fucking rooster. That was a rooster. That was actually a rooster.

147
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:04,619
That was a chicken. That was like a, what the? Oh, bandage. Nice. Hide. This game's impossible.

148
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:26,150
This game's not possible. This game's actually impossible. It seems to be something in the pipe.

149
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:52,900
I can't reach it. Okay. That's not rusty though. I need like a stick. Nothing in there. God. The

150
00:51:52,900 --> 00:52:01,369
valve was rusty. That's right. That was down in the basement, right? I can't carry any more objects.

151
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:15,739
What are you talking about? Oh, I just put, I can't carry any more items. Where should I put this?

152
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:26,280
Oh, right here. I'm going to put it right here. I'm going to hide under. I'm going to hide under

153
00:52:26,280 --> 00:53:34,219
the bed. Okay. Put it down right here and put it down. Oh, was that a key? I got a key of some kind

154
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:48,360
and a trunk. Can I open this? Okay. Open the trunk with the key, dude. Excuse me. Open the trunk with

155
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,780
that key right now. I can't get in my inventory. Why? My inventory doesn't work. Inventory doesn't

156
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:13,480
work. Why does my inventory not work? Tab. It's broken. I actually can't use my inventory. Yeah.

157
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:33,719
Tab. I. Tab and I. Yeah. Doesn't work. Tab. Try hiding again. Maybe it'll reset it. God damn it.

158
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:46,460
Please, man. Don't even. Why is his own fire? Oh, what? What the fuck happened? This is why I

159
00:54:46,460 --> 00:55:11,480
couldn't. What the hell is happening to me? Okay. I can use my inventory again. Where's the, where's

160
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:42,099
the door that I just was at? Where's the door? Where's the, where's that door? Rust. Rust. Where's

161
00:55:42,099 --> 00:56:33,300
the, where is it? Where is, where is it? What happened? I just shut down my computer. I think

162
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:48,340
I shut my computer. I think I shut my computer down. I opened the power menu and it shut. Dude,

163
00:56:48,340 --> 00:57:08,059
what? How do you? I quit. I quit this game. You start at the beginning every time. You start at

164
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:53,690
the beginning every time. There's no checkpoints. Huh? I don't even want to. I mean, these are just

165
00:57:53,690 --> 00:58:02,659
weird. These are just weird now. I'm just going for a speed run. Fuck it. I'm going for a speed

166
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:27,429
run right now. Chemicals are upstairs. So many fucking doors in this house. I don't even know

167
00:58:27,429 --> 00:59:03,210
where. I get so lost so easily. I can't play these. I need the alarm clock to throw in there. Alarm

168
00:59:03,210 --> 01:00:01,780
clock. Okay. Here he comes. Where was the alarm clock? I don't remember. I don't know. I don't

169
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:14,730
know where I am in this fucking house. I don't even know how to get downstairs. I'm serious. I

170
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:39,300
don't know how to get downstairs. I don't know how to get downstairs. How are you still chasing

171
01:00:39,300 --> 01:01:11,670
me? It's impossible. You didn't even see me. I can't run anymore. I can't get away from him.

172
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:16,309
He's too fast. Dude, you can't get away from this motherfucker. You can't get away from him. He's

173
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:38,710
so fast. I can't see. I'm so bad with like permanence and locate. I can't play. I don't

174
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:44,789
fucking give a shit about this game. I don't care. I leave. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I give up.

175
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:12,980
Is there an alarm here? Every room looks exactly the fucking same and like he runs so fast and

176
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,579
like there's just items fucking sprinkled in every corner and you're gonna take the fucking alarm

177
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:19,699
clock out of this room and then go to go up there and then take the fucking rust pour and pour that

178
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:49,639
and get the chemical and get the chemical and then get the key. I have to hide immediately.

179
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,719
He's like already in the fucking room and he's gonna grab me out of this canister and he's gonna

180
01:02:53,719 --> 01:03:13,909
slash my head. Stop. Why is he still here? He should not be coming back in this room.

181
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:51,639
Going upstairs. Okay. I think I've got every item that I need. There's nothing else down here,

182
01:03:51,639 --> 01:04:00,309
right? I got the valve is down here. I gotta bring. I gotta go all the way upstairs, get the

183
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:25,030
rust remover and bring it down here. If I'm gonna try that problem is I don't even know how to get

184
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:30,010
up. I need like a fable to breadcrumb trail, dude. I like seriously. I can't even know what hallway

185
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:41,670
we're in and he's just right up your ass the whole time and I don't want to turn the light on

186
01:04:41,670 --> 01:05:19,110
because it'll attract him. See, I don't, I can't commit anything to memory because my brain is in

187
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:34,090
a constant state of distress. So I can't commit anything to memory straight across from that weird

188
01:05:34,090 --> 01:06:13,340
door is the basement. Okay. I gotta remember that. I need to draw a map. He's just, he's just,

189
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:16,860
you do. I have to speed run because the dude just never going to leave me alone. Just get out of my

190
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:39,219
way. Fuck you buddy. That's fine. I quit. I quit this game. I quit this game. Where's the stairs

191
01:06:39,219 --> 01:07:02,730
to go up the stairs? I quit this game. Draw a map. Do you want me to draw a map? I can't. I'm just

192
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:23,619
trying to lose him. Do you can't lose the guy. I can't lose him. Why is he still right behind me?

193
01:07:23,619 --> 01:07:58,860
Dude, you can't see in your own fucking house. That's horse shit. Which way is it? Right here,

194
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:08,280
right? Get out of the fucking way. You huge asshole. Dude, what do you even?

195
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:48,140
Rust remover and paint can room valve in basement alarm clock and fireplace room door with hole

196
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:59,430
in the room with the two bedrooms. Thank you for the help. All right. I'm just,

197
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:09,079
I'm going to try this one more time. This dude's up your ass the whole game. He doesn't go like

198
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:14,250
disappear for like a minute. No, he's just, he's here. It's terrifying. It's horrible. And he's

199
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:35,819
going to stand here like a dick. I bet she comes back in the room. The alarm clock is random.

200
01:09:35,819 --> 01:10:41,479
This is really, that's so horrible. Okay. How do I get up the stairs? This is a door that leads

201
01:10:41,479 --> 01:11:10,979
to another door, which leads to the stairs up. He's walking by. Okay. Downstairs is there. That

202
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:37,289
means he is another door over here. I think it's straight ahead. Is he upstairs or downstairs?

203
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:58,890
Is he, where is he? Is he upstairs? I think he's upstairs. Like, is he upstairs? What the fuck,

204
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:09,659
dude? Why? Where am I? Yeah. Go look in here. There's a fucking clock in here. Oh my God.

205
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:36,739
You can lower the, I'm getting Luigi. All right. I'm getting Luigi. This change will be permanent

206
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:40,739
and you will only be able to play again at the real difficulty. If you start a new game,

207
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:44,180
if you continue without making changes, this message will be displayed again. If you die

208
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:52,300
again, do you want to lower the enemy difficulty? I can't believe I got fucking Luigi. I can't

209
01:12:52,300 --> 01:13:00,779
believe it. I'm too. I don't care. I want to see this. I want to see. I don't care. I don't care.

210
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:36,979
I'm getting Luigi. I don't even care. I'm going to laugh my ass off. Can you imagine if I die

211
01:13:36,979 --> 01:14:43,340
like three more times and it's like, do you want it even easier? Fuck isn't here. Get out of here.

212
01:14:43,340 --> 01:15:09,260
Get the fuck out of here. Get out of this hallway. Like get out of this hallway. You chump. Okay.

213
01:15:09,260 --> 01:16:05,590
All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Where's it? Where's the clock coming down

214
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:15,500
here? You should try murder house. I played murder house. I beat it. That was pretty,

215
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:38,069
that was recently. I don't know if he's still here. Where's, I don't have the clock though.

216
01:16:38,069 --> 01:17:33,460
Can't hide under that. Where's the clock? I don't know where he is, but he's, I don't know. I don't

217
01:17:33,460 --> 01:18:12,569
know. You can't be serious. Right when I come out of the fucking hiding, he's now walking around here.

218
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:28,739
You can't, I'm not even scared anymore. You're just making me angry. You're just pissing me off.

219
01:18:28,739 --> 01:18:52,199
I need to hide right now. I need to hide right now. I would love to just jump out of here and

220
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:59,380
jump scare him. Grab the sickle out of his hand and just right in his head. Don't even, you open

221
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:03,350
that and I'm fucking uninstalling again. If you open this cabinet, I'm going to uninstall the game.

222
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:26,090
Thank you. You still here? What are you still doing? Okay. He went upstairs. I think he's upstairs.

223
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:33,560
All right. Valve time. You know what I mean? Like they say, they're going to make a game and then

224
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:55,770
it takes like another extra few years working on valve time. The rust is still dissolving.

225
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:58,789
I probably should hide. He's going to come down and go like,

226
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:22,569
whatever he says. Still dissolving. I was sitting here the whole time. I don't care.

227
01:20:22,649 --> 01:21:05,590
There's a raid from where? I didn't see a raid. What does that do? Water is already flowing in

228
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:14,539
the pipes. I should check the bathrooms. Oh, the sink. There's a sink that has right wherever that

229
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:32,869
is. I don't remember where that sink is. You look like Kenneth Copeland for a few frames here. What?

230
01:21:32,869 --> 01:21:45,770
Oh my God. My eyes are bugging out of my head. My, holy shit. My eyes almost come out of my head,

231
01:21:45,770 --> 01:22:26,619
out of my socket. How do I save this? This is a crazy image. Watch my eyes. That's insane.

232
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:45,340
Skeleton for a few frames. All right. Back to this. Check the bathrooms. All right. He's down

233
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:52,380
here again. Wait till he comes. He's going to walk through here. Or should I just run for it?

234
01:22:52,380 --> 01:23:27,289
Where's the bathroom? Don't sprint. It's instantly going to give away with the other.

235
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:55,880
I'm getting speech jammed by butyl berry. Sorry. Only sprint when he's chasing you.

236
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:16,279
Okay. Everybody's under the tables, reached over and just like did this like out in the hall.

237
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:34,630
Okay. I need a bathroom. I don't know. Is he, did he try? Is he turning around? He's in there.

238
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:45,579
Okay. He just went up the stairs. This is my opportunity. My opportunity. Opportunity.

239
01:24:45,579 --> 01:25:04,489
Let's go. Don't sprint. Bathroom. Is he above me or is he over here? I think he's above me.

240
01:25:04,489 --> 01:25:17,960
What is this? This is like, I got to get something to break that open with. Bathroom. Here we go.

241
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:46,489
Oh shit. He's right there. Right next to me. Where's the bathroom with the thing that was

242
01:25:46,489 --> 01:26:37,239
in the sink? It's upstairs. I haven't heard him move. He's like over here. He's up here.

243
01:26:37,239 --> 01:27:32,140
I'm dead. Oh, I hate this. It's on easy mode. It's on easy mode. I'm just going up the stairs.

244
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:46,739
I don't give a shit if he hears me. I thought he was downstairs. Oh my God. That was the worst

245
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:55,079
thing ever. That was probably the worst thing ever. I quit. That was the worst thing ever.

246
01:27:55,079 --> 01:28:01,750
I thought he was downstairs. I actually thought he was downstairs. I thought he was downstairs.

247
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:17,289
Nothing. Well, that hurt my whole body. I don't think I can play this. Okay. You took my advice

248
01:28:17,289 --> 01:28:33,670
for three minutes and then you said fuck it and he immediately died. He wouldn't get away from

249
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:39,859
upstairs. I was waiting and waiting and waiting. I was hiding under the table and I heard it's him

250
01:28:39,859 --> 01:28:45,619
going up and down the top floor. So I'm just like, all right. I don't care. I'm going up there.

251
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:53,899
I'm doing it my way. I'm doing it my way. Your way is correct. My way is stupid and it's going

252
01:28:53,899 --> 01:29:33,369
to get me killed. But I'm going for it. Not now. Not now. Not now. Please not now. I'm going to

253
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:57,819
sneeze. No, we're supposed to be doing this my way. I got the rust. We're going downstairs. Turn

254
01:29:57,819 --> 01:30:09,300
the valve on. Fuck it. Run upstairs. What am I doing here? This is not my way. This is my way.

255
01:30:09,300 --> 01:31:00,630
Where's the valve? This is my way. Okay. Now I need to go get clock. We're doing it my way.

256
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:29,340
Clock is upstairs. Clock is up. Fireplace. The rust is dissolving. The sink will be available.

257
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:49,109
This is an Adventure Time bit right now. What happened in Adventure Time? Okay. So there's a

258
01:31:49,109 --> 01:31:55,449
bathroom up here. I got to fish out whatever's in the sink. I then have whatever's in the sink.

259
01:31:55,449 --> 01:32:06,710
I still need the alarm clock. I didn't turn the valve. Oh my God. You're right. All right.

260
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:14,329
That sucks. I'm in trouble now. Oh, that actually sucks. I think it's over.

261
01:32:24,100 --> 01:33:15,720
Close it. Close it. Is he still here? I think he's gone. Yeah. He went back upstairs. Okay.

262
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:26,630
Now we got to go all the way upstairs. What's up, buddy? What's up, buddy? What's up, buddy?

263
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:43,739
I need the clock. He went upstairs. I need the clock. There's no clock. Okay. Guys,

264
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:50,310
where's the clock? Honestly, where's the clock? It's not in here and I haven't seen it in any

265
01:33:50,310 --> 01:34:06,149
other room. Just tell me where it is. Oh, Raid. Oh, Mr. Sark. What's up, Sark? Thank you, Mr.

266
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:13,319
Sark, for the raid. Welcome, everybody. I'm currently about to rage quit this game and

267
01:34:13,319 --> 01:34:17,369
never play it again. You're in the middle of it. You're coming in right with that. This is the

268
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:23,590
fiftieth attempt. I had to put it on easy. They can't do it. It's a pretty fun game,

269
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:40,630
I would say. I'm about to uninstall it. Pretty good. Where is the clock? It's a wrench. It's

270
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:52,869
too hot. Are you serious? Just grab it quick. Gotta get upstairs again, right?

271
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:17,159
There seems to be something in the pipe. I can't. It didn't happen. It didn't push it up from the

272
01:35:17,159 --> 01:35:34,890
water. It seems to be something. I can't. How do I use the sink? I need the wrench. How do I need

273
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:49,369
to get water to put the fire out, to get the wrench to come up here? How do I put the fire out

274
01:35:49,369 --> 01:36:20,409
from the tub? I need something to hold. Find the alarm clock. The key you get unlocks a save point.

275
01:36:20,409 --> 01:36:40,090
Really? Cork, cork, cork. Is it right here? I have something to cut it with. I need to

276
01:36:40,090 --> 01:36:53,500
get scissors or scissors. But anyway, say thanks to Sark for the raid. Follow Sark. An awesome dude.

277
01:36:53,500 --> 01:37:03,289
Get the key. Key. All right. Just give me a route to take. The key is a route. I need a route.

278
01:37:03,289 --> 01:37:18,170
I gotta go. Alarm clock, bedroom, fire, key. But I don't know where the alarm clock is.

279
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:27,819
It's in a random spot, apparently. I don't know where the alarm clock is. Alarm clock, key, plywood

280
01:37:27,819 --> 01:38:27,189
door. It's a random spawn on the second floor. You buddy. Not in here. Random spawn on the second

281
01:38:27,189 --> 01:38:51,100
floor. Spawn on the second floor. Where's this dumbass clock? Shitting me. Okay, now we gotta

282
01:38:51,100 --> 01:39:08,250
go upstairs. Get my bearings. It's up. Hide. Get them to run into the door. Get the lock. Get the

283
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:13,829
key. Come back down here. Open up the thing with the boarded hallway. And then apparently that's a

284
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:29,000
checkpoint. Okay, I'm going for it. I'm going. No, I'm not. He's still here. Why can't I just press,

285
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,409
like, like B and get, like, the fucking seam through the wall? Every video game has that now.

286
01:39:36,409 --> 01:40:08,739
Every video game has it. Put it in this. I'm doing it my way. I gotta listen closely

287
01:40:08,739 --> 01:40:34,979
because if it sounds from... Is he up here or is he downstairs? I don't know. I'm here. I made it.

288
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:44,010
Okay, give me a second. I think he was up here, actually. That's terrifying. He was. He was up

289
01:40:44,010 --> 01:41:08,220
here. I just didn't see him. Okay, so, lock. Get in there. Grab the key. Downstairs to that plywood

290
01:41:08,220 --> 01:42:26,489
thing on the wall, right? Open that. Look, people are dancing. Get out of here, man. You're making

291
01:42:26,489 --> 01:42:43,430
me angry. We get this weird cutscene again. Yep. Okay, this is the... Right? Okay, okay. Yep.

292
01:42:43,430 --> 01:43:21,909
Ah! Okay, don't get caught here. Okay, okay. Here we are. It's right here. Isn't it right here?

293
01:43:21,909 --> 01:43:32,659
It's right here, right? This is it? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong, though?

294
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:42,550
What's wrong? I didn't even read what it said. What does it say? What does it say?

295
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:51,539
I couldn't read it. I need to remove rust and then... Okay, this guy's a real piece of shit,

296
01:43:51,539 --> 01:44:31,189
I'll tell you. Is he gone? I wish this thing would shut up so I could hear.

297
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:16,060
Is it open? Is the door... The door's open. Is it the wrong door? That's the wrong door. Where is it?

298
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:30,789
It's the hallway in front of that one. I just wish it would go upstairs or something. Just go away.

299
01:45:30,789 --> 01:45:39,029
Go downstairs. Go upstairs. Go anywhere else. He walked that over there. Well, that way on your

300
01:45:39,029 --> 01:46:05,479
screen because it's flipped. He went to the left. Go the fuck away. Go away. Go away. Why is he still

301
01:46:05,479 --> 01:47:33,479
here? Go away. Go away. Go upstairs. Go away. I hate this game so much. I actually... I'm done with it.

302
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:58,409
I'm just done. If I die again, I'm over. It's over. Damn it. Okay, open. He's coming down here

303
01:47:58,409 --> 01:48:17,529
and he won't leave me alone. He won't leave me be. He won't leave me alone. If you die... Hold on.

304
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:21,609
If you die before you manage to unlock that padlock, I'm going to unsubscribe.

305
01:48:21,609 --> 01:48:28,939
You're not even subscribed. I think you don't have to change anything. You're not even subbed.

306
01:48:28,939 --> 01:48:57,180
Still down here? You piece of shit. I swear to God. Where's the door? Where's the door?

307
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:40,010
Oh, fuck. I've never played this game again. This person... That person was subbed for three months.

308
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:59,369
Oh. Oh, sorry. No, they're not subbed. They're not subbed. They've been following... Okay.

309
01:49:59,369 --> 01:50:05,619
So they aren't subbed. I'm waiting till I hear that sound go off and then I'm going back up.

310
01:50:05,619 --> 01:50:10,539
I'm going to unsub if you don't get that padlock off. All right. The amount of fucking unsub Andy's

311
01:50:10,539 --> 01:50:24,390
in the chat, apparently, if I can't open this door. They said Omega Low. I got gifted a free sub.

312
01:50:24,390 --> 01:51:12,420
Omega Low. Get out of here. On your left. I know. I'm fucking scared, man. He's going to come and get

313
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:24,199
me. I thought he was right in the hallway next door. I can't even see. I don't know. He could

314
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:43,770
kill me right now. I don't know. You were right there. The game uses your microphone. It doesn't.

315
01:51:43,770 --> 01:52:52,460
I got it. Don't move. I can't carry any more objects. Crowbar. Should I drop something?

316
01:52:52,460 --> 01:53:16,199
Sub stays. I saved it. I saved it. Do I need this anymore? Okay. There's a panel I can open

317
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:21,720
with the crowbar. I'm so happy. I'm just going to run out. I'm just going to do it my way now.

318
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:28,840
Can you read the dialogue? What do you mean? Wait. What do you mean? Limited saves?

319
01:53:32,600 --> 01:54:42,819
What the fuck? We're doing it my way. You have to hide, you fucking idiot. What's even in there?

320
01:54:42,819 --> 01:54:53,659
Love Tweed. Hey, Love Tweed. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Thanks for the raid. Playing a game. I'm

321
01:54:53,659 --> 01:54:59,420
about to rage quit it. I'm about to rage quit this game. Welcome. Hope you had a good stream.

322
01:55:01,079 --> 01:55:09,659
I'm ready to play. And I'm doing it my way, by the way. But no, welcome. Thanks for the raid.

323
01:55:09,659 --> 01:55:26,779
What is in here? Diary and a... It's missing batteries. Okay. I don't... What should I drop?

324
01:55:26,779 --> 01:55:34,229
I'm going to drop. Which I don't even know what to drop here. Why? How am I inventory so bad?

325
01:55:34,229 --> 01:55:56,710
Do I still need the crowbar? Someone's coming. Use the rope in the hole? Yeah.

326
01:55:56,710 --> 01:56:17,529
But I need to pick up whatever this is. Can I open the fridge with the crowbar?

327
01:56:17,529 --> 01:56:42,920
Okay. Let's get it. Where is it? Okay. I got the diary. Very bad at diary.

328
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:50,229
I don't like being here. The house is very dirty and smells like garbage. It only feeds me.

329
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:06,579
Why can I not read this hiding under here? Why can I not read this hiding? It's a book.

330
01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:16,220
You seem pissy tonight. What? I'm playing a scary game. It's a scary environment, man.

331
01:57:16,220 --> 01:57:38,140
Go read it in the save room. Oh, good idea. Where's the save room again? I don't remember.

332
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:58,359
Let's read this diary. Um, it feeds me raw meat. It tastes really bad, although at least he feeds

333
01:57:58,359 --> 01:58:06,550
me and doesn't look lock me up like mom and dad did. Today, my new father got angry with me because

334
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:14,039
I grew up in my food, but I couldn't help it. He took my stuff and threw it down the well in

335
01:58:14,039 --> 01:58:20,229
the basement. Although luckily I had my video game console hidden away. Tonight, I was brave

336
01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:24,069
and went down to the basement, but I got scared when I got close to the well because I heard

337
01:58:24,069 --> 01:58:30,699
someone screaming inside. So I, uh, I ran out into my room. I'm getting moved to the food

338
01:58:30,699 --> 01:58:39,319
my new dad gives me. I think I like it. I'm getting used to the, all right. Today we went hunting and

339
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:46,329
come back with lots of new meat. Father told me that we have to leave them alive until we need

340
01:58:46,329 --> 01:58:52,739
them to eat that way. They stay fresh and the meat tastes better. I don't know why the smell of me

341
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:58,810
new home bothered me. Now I find it cozy. I don't want to be anywhere else but here. What does that

342
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:24,090
even tell me? I'm going up. I'm going up. I'm going to run out. We're doing it my way. I'm going to

343
01:59:24,090 --> 01:59:36,329
get into the, we're going upstairs. Drop the diary. Yeah. Good call. Should I pick up the, uh, crowbar

344
01:59:36,329 --> 02:00:26,170
again? What can I nuts? Fuck. Um, I'm going upstairs. Is he up here? He's up here. He's up here.

345
02:00:27,130 --> 02:01:18,460
I need the wrench. You man. You idiot. You idiot. Get out of the fucking way. Use the rope for the

346
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:36,500
wrench. I ain't going to make it. I ain't going to make it. Thanks for watching this stream everybody.

347
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:40,380
You guys have been great. I'll definitely see you tomorrow. We're going to be playing, uh,

348
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:46,100
Breath of the Wild for an hour or two. And then we're going to do one more Omega sponsored Gotham

349
02:01:46,100 --> 02:02:03,899
night stream. We'll play Breath of the Wild first. And that doesn't work. Doesn't work. Doesn't work.

350
02:02:04,539 --> 02:02:32,460
What time? 2 p.m. tomorrow. 2 p.m. Pacific. Breath of the Wild first. Gotham nights. And that's

351
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:48,649
probably it. Tomorrow's going to be a little shorter. All right. What, what's the, where am I

352
02:02:48,649 --> 02:03:00,359
going? Use the get the rope. Can I put that down downstairs in the basement? Can I go, can I drop

353
02:03:00,359 --> 02:03:05,210
that down in the well in the basement where the padlock was? Use the crowbar on the floor near the

354
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:19,800
diary. Um, I don't remember. Where's the crowbar? Did I, where did I drop the crowbar? I hate being

355
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:49,159
in this room. The kitchen. Ah, that's not the kitchen. That's the bathroom. What are you doing?

356
02:03:49,159 --> 02:03:59,779
You fucking dumb. Are you dumb? Why would I come out? I'm, I'm not like Burger King or something.

357
02:03:59,779 --> 02:04:02,979
You know what I mean? I want Burger King right now. I'm going, I'm going to go. I want Burger King.

358
02:04:02,979 --> 02:04:18,340
I'm getting to Burger King. Yeah, I'm going to get Burger King. How many bandages? Okay. Now

359
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:28,250
use this where the diary was. Lower where the di- I'm going in here. Just be safe.

360
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:56,149
Should I save it? Should I save the game? No. So you're saying the diary or the trunk you couldn't

361
02:04:56,149 --> 02:05:35,539
open. That's right. I, I tried the trunk. The trunk was up here. It's that. Video game and a note.

362
02:05:35,539 --> 02:06:16,520
Dude, does the note say? Can I open this? Stop, stop. Stop. It's open. I gotta close it. Back to where

363
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:38,659
you found the diary. Pick up the game console. I can't play this game. Combination of the lock

364
02:06:38,659 --> 02:06:42,500
in the well is the same as my score in the mutant horde game. Although I don't remember it. And for

365
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:59,699
a debris pair, I have to get more than 6,000 points. Sick. All right. All right. Okay. Grab the

366
02:07:00,260 --> 02:07:21,619
game cartridge. Grab the game console. Get the padlock key. Okay. Do I have room though?

367
02:07:21,619 --> 02:07:28,279
What do I do with the rope? Cause I can't carry anything else. I don't know what to do with the

368
02:07:28,279 --> 02:08:05,579
rope and these batteries too. Should I save it? I think I'm going to save it. I think I gotta stop.

369
02:08:05,579 --> 02:08:20,649
I'm going to save it. It's probably a stupid idea. No, but I'm doing it. Yeah. I gotta stop. My brain

370
02:08:20,649 --> 02:08:41,770
is, is on, is my brain's fucked up. Yeah. I'm stopping. This is ridiculous. I can't believe

371
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:49,050
I even showed that. I'm, I'm covered in water. I don't even want to show you my back. It's fucked.

372
02:08:49,050 --> 02:09:00,710
This is, it's a horror game. All right. All right. That, uh, it saved in case I ever come back to

373
02:09:00,710 --> 02:09:08,539
this game. This is fucked up. This whole game was a fucking nightmare. It's disgusting. You're

374
02:09:08,539 --> 02:09:17,430
whatever. You're fine. Yeah, that's going to be it. Uh, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Uh,

375
02:09:17,430 --> 02:09:28,390
tomorrow is breath of the wild and, uh, Gotham Knights. I will probably open with this when I

376
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:41,159
play, uh, stay out of the house. Yeah. You've been good. You guys have been good. You get to have it.

377
02:09:43,399 --> 02:09:56,859
That was fun. Again, uh, thanks for sticking around and you kind of jumbling around a lot

378
02:09:56,859 --> 02:10:05,619
the last day or two, but it's been a lot of fun. This dream has been very fun and having a blast.

379
02:10:05,619 --> 02:10:10,869
Gotham Knights is going to conclude tomorrow. Tomorrow's stream is only going to be probably

380
02:10:10,869 --> 02:10:18,520
four hours long. We'll play breath of the wild for like two hours to three hours and then move to

381
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:36,710
Gotham Knights for a couple hours. 2 PM Pacific, but just make it 2 30. Be safe. Appreciate it.

382
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:42,020
Thanks guys. Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for the raids. I'm going to get some food and take a

383
02:10:42,020 --> 02:11:27,319
shower. Have a great night. Take care. Call your mother. See you soon.
