1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:11,529
Oh, what the heck? What the fuck? A raid. Raid coming in. I just turned the stream on a raid coming in.

2
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:24,579
What? No way. Who's raiding me right now? I'm getting a raid. Oh my god. What the heck? Raid.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:44,420
Do it. Where is it? Oh, what the fuck? Raid. They're not gonna do it? Oh, what the heck?

4
00:00:45,799 --> 00:01:01,320
Are you kidding me? A navy bog with a raid. No way. They all left.

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,719
They didn't. I caught that in pre-stream. You don't think I... I can see what you're doing.

6
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,090
Sing the raid song. No, I need a new raid song. I didn't even tweet the stream out. Just wait a

7
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:23,269
minute. Thanks to the raid though of everybody that like planned to do that. Only 157 of you

8
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:38,650
went over there. It's like 60,000 people in pre-stream chat. What the hell? Show video. I

9
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,739
don't understand what's going on here, by the way. Let me be really, really clear. I made a

10
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:49,719
Thanksgiving... Happy Thanksgiving video last night and people all lost their minds. I have no idea

11
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,689
what's going on. I just said, hey, Happy Thanksgiving. I just... I don't... I wanted to do more tweets. I

12
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:01,450
wanted to get more stuff out there. They'll say tweet more. Give us more updates and shit. So

13
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:08,139
I don't know people... That tweet has been seen like three million times. I don't understand why.

14
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:20,229
I don't get... I just like... That was for you guys. Whatever. It's because of what? Vinny saw it,

15
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:30,120
by the way. Yeah, I know. I also heard that there was a little bit of debate of how much that was

16
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,080
going to shave off the debt. I wasn't even doing that to shave debt off. I did it because I felt

17
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:50,250
like doing it. None. None. I was going to play Sly Cooper today, but that didn't end up happening.

18
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:58,729
I bought it for the PS3 and I noticed that I started downloading Sly Cooper and the Thievius

19
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:03,770
Raccoonius, whatever the name of the... I don't know, whatever it is. So I leave the room. I come

20
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:10,409
back after like 15, 20 minutes and my room just smells like burning plastic. Just burnt plastic.

21
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,500
It was disgusting. And I remember talking about this before. I brought this up. I was like,

22
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,139
why does it smell like burning plastic? Remember that on Saw 2, right? This is not the first time

23
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:31,849
this has happened, but it was way worse this time. It was gas. Well, it was bad. It wasn't very good.

24
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,259
So I'm like, I don't want to smell this all day. No, we're not doing that. So I was like,

25
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,419
maybe I'll do an emulator or something. And I tried it. I couldn't get the emulator to do what

26
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,300
I wanted. Didn't like the way it looked. So Sly Cooper's going back in the bag for like another

27
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,659
week. I don't know. I'm sorry. I know so many people wanted that and they were like, oh,

28
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:02,580
I can't wait for Sly Cooper, dude. Sorry, my PlayStation 3 was burning. So we're going to

29
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:11,020
pivot. We're going to play Cooking Simulator today. Specifically the pizza update. I made sure to eat

30
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:21,779
a lot of food before this stream. Do it on PS Now. No, PS Now is no. PS Now, remember I tried to do

31
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:29,740
Red Dead on PS Now? It's not, I don't want to stream through PS Now. It kind of looks like

32
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,339
not very good because it already gets compressed and then I compress it again.

33
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,459
There's a little bit of input lag too on PS Now, which I don't, I'm not going to play a platformer

34
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:48,420
with like a quarter second input delay. We're going to see Bugleberry today. Why would Bugleberry be

35
00:04:48,420 --> 00:05:00,019
here today? Stop streaming please in 720p. Your streams look so low quality. I know. Wait, I'm

36
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:14,730
going to do 900p. But I need a 3080. I need a i7-99000K, whatever it is, or an i9. Oh no,

37
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:21,850
we're going AMD. I forgot. I'm going to get a Risen like Threadripper 64 core monster PC.

38
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:31,779
He's going to AMD Omegalel. Yeah, AMD has surpassed Intel in technology from what I've been told.

39
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:42,250
I've been told that AMD is rocking it right now. How true is that? I don't know.

40
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:54,889
Get away from me. Okay, I don't know why somebody, did somebody just say just watch the AMD

41
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:03,959
CPU video on YouTube? Like this is the ending of a video game? Did I read that correctly?

42
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:12,649
Ha, dude. Oh yeah, dude. Just watch the AMD CPU on YouTube. Oh, okay. I guess that is the same.

43
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,560
All right, it's pizza time. I had to mute this because this has just been going on.

44
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,910
I can't turn this off. I have, my desktop audio has been at zero for the last 10 straight minutes.

45
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:38,329
Yeah, it's pizza time. We're going to talk, we're going to talk a lot about pizza today.

46
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,089
My favorite pizza, your favorite pizza. What is my favorite pizza? You guys already know that.

47
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:55,269
Do you know what it is? Do you know? I hope you do. It is a thin crust pepperoni pizza

48
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:04,410
with no bullshit. That's it. Thin crust, crispy, crunchy, delicious. That's based.

49
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:11,829
That's boring. I don't like a bunch of stuff on my pizza because it weighs the pizza down.

50
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:15,269
And then, all right, hold on. I got to turn this down. Like,

51
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:28,699
dude, I can take my headphones out. So I don't like when toppings weigh pizza down. I don't.

52
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:38,649
I only like one or two toppings per pizza and they got to be light. All right, bring it back.

53
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:48,569
It's boring. No, why is it boring? It's like, I want sausage, eggs, peppers, onions. No, I want

54
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,050
a croissant, eggs, and cheese on my pizza. I want a croissant with pizza. Like, what are you talking

55
00:07:53,050 --> 00:08:04,470
about, dude? Don't order that. What are you doing? No, I like simple pizzas. Peppers and onions.

56
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,949
Sounds good. Pepperoni. Sounds good. Garlic and onion. You got me. I'm on board.

57
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,939
I almost just wrote what I said the word.

58
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,870
No, sorry. We need to do a pizza tier list today. I don't know, in half an hour.

59
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:38,950
All right, let's go. Pizza Simulator. I will try pineapple on pizza the correct way. I've been

60
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:52,820
told I've been eating it wrong and I'm willing to go for it. I'm willing to try it. New order.

61
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,039
Margarita. Press T. Hello and welcome to Papa Pepe's Pizzeria. I see great promise in you.

62
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,440
So much so that I'd like to share some of my secrets. And if you prove yourself, I may even

63
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,000
let you run this pizzeria. Your training begins. Imagine going to work for Coca-Cola and Mr.

64
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,159
Coca-Cola walks up to you, the CEO. Oh, you're the new hire. Yeah, that's a good handshake.

65
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:20,039
The secret is fucking, is castor oil. What? You're going to do really good here, kid.

66
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:30,009
Okay, let's go. I'm sure you already know this, but let's cover some basics. I'll show you how

67
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,659
to assemble a pizza from already. All right, let me see if I know how to do this. Bake it in

68
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:46,230
the oven and finally serve it. Why it's so bright in here. Is my, what? Yes, and put on your company

69
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:59,220
pizza headphones while you're working. Name and address. Why? What do you want to name it a dress

70
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:12,279
for? What the hell is this here for? What? Okay. 60 FOV. Yeah, right. Okay. That, why does this feel

71
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:21,639
way worse now? Name and address. Why does it want your address? That's fucked up. Okay. Here we go.

72
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,929
Let's begin with the base for our pizza. They can't be pizza without it. To make a base,

73
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,809
you'll have to roll out the pizza dough, get some dough and place it on the bake board.

74
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:38,809
Dough. Okay. All right. Place the Neapolitan-style dough on the bake board.

75
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:46,500
We're going to roll this out. Okay. Enter the creation view by pressing on the lump of dough.

76
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,860
Okay. This is where you can roll out the dough and decorate it with ingredients.

77
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,299
You can have up to three pizza bases at the same time on the bake board. Use A and D to switch

78
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:08,710
between lumps of dough or pizza bases. So you use to roll the dough. That looks pretty good. Oh,

79
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,830
no. What? I don't want the edges. Okay. W to switch to the GN container view shelf.

80
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,019
You'll find some ingredients and some sauce that I prepared for you. In the future,

81
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,450
you'll have to prepare the ingredients yourself. Okay. So this is the shelf where you keep all the

82
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:31,980
pizza ingredients. No edges. I like a thin crust. I don't like the big, I like a thin crust. This is

83
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,480
too big and bulky. Make a stuff crust. If you can make a stuff crust, I'll do it. Okay. A and D to

84
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,059
switch between ingredients. Right. Okay. Remember, you can only use the ingredients that have been

85
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:50,700
stored in a GN container beforehand and slot it into the shelf. You use to choose the sauce.

86
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Nice. Oh, yes. This looks small. Now click on the pizza base to pour the sauce on it, then move

87
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,779
while holding to spread the sauce around the surface. I know I've, I've seen the pizza hut

88
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:22,600
training video from 1985. I know how to do this. Oops. Didn't do anything. Oh, there we go. Okay.

89
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,649
All right. All right. All right. You stop at the edges. You don't go any further. But wait,

90
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:39,019
I need to get a little bit on that crust. He did it too much. It looks like a coiled up turd.

91
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,659
Okay. Now to add some cheese.

92
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:56,340
Somebody said, stop dragging the ladle. I'm all right. Everybody relax. Okay. That's enough. Now

93
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,460
time to add some cheese. It has to be placed evenly so we can cover the whole surface of our

94
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,779
pizza when it melts. Remember that you can use Q and D to rotate the cheese slices. Really?

95
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:18,899
Is this cheese? Okay. We can rotate and this is going to, I don't, I actually prefer when

96
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:30,860
it's shredded. Okay. That, that's it. Finish. Add some basil leaves. Oh, okay. Here's the herbs.

97
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:40,870
All right. Now just put it on there. Used to place basil leaves on the pizza on the template. Okay.

98
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:50,789
All right. Now we have to bake it. Our pizza is ready to put in the oven. However, the oven

99
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:56,710
needs to be prepared to fire up the oven and place a log, a log inside the firebox. How do I get out

100
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:09,500
of here? Wait, we have to actually feed the fire? All right. Oven. Okay. Before we can start baking,

101
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,259
the oven needs to reach the optimal temperature. You can check the temperatures in the thermometer

102
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:19,690
on the left side of the oven. As time progresses, the oven will slowly run out of fuel. Make sure

103
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:29,779
to add logs from time to time to keep the fire going. Get it in there. All right. Get it in the

104
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:42,200
green. How much wood does it take? A wood-fired pizza? Yeah, that's the best. Okay. Now let's

105
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,580
shove the pizza into the oven, but don't try to do it with your bare hands. Oh, okay. I need to pick

106
00:14:47,580 --> 00:15:01,340
up the pizza peel. No, that's not a pizza peel. Get rid of that. Whatever. Okay. Where's the pizza

107
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:07,179
peel? Oh, that thing. Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial. Holding out shift will

108
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:17,539
open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding in your hand. All right. Let's

109
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:32,570
get it. All right. I got it. And we put it inside of here. Slide it in. All right. Then we just let

110
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,899
it sit in here, right? Pay attention. If it's too low, add logs. If it's too high, close the chamber.

111
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:52,710
All right. Oh, I need to add logs. Logs. What if I know if it's done? I never understood this shit

112
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,049
because you can't even see in there. You know what I mean? I can't see in there. There needs

113
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:04,220
to be a camera pointing down inside of these ovens. Okay. It's hot. Nice and hot, hot, hot, hot.

114
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:22,100
Okay. Give me the tool. And it's ready. Get it. Take out the pizza. Oh, that looks pretty good.

115
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:31,210
Doesn't it? That looks pretty good. I'm so glad I ate before this stream. Boring. It's a tutorial

116
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:43,220
pizza. Serve it through the window. Serve it through the window. If you just like freeze

117
00:16:43,539 --> 00:17:02,570
out at somebody. All right. Pick it up. Oh, wait. All right. Here you go. Come get it. I can't fit

118
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:14,700
it out there. This plate is so big. This is a mess up. This is a small pizza on an extra large

119
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:41,930
pizza tray. What the fuck is going on? Can I get out? Can I get out the window? Okay. It's ready.

120
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:50,819
I need to make another pizza. Serve it through the serving window. That's not the serving window.

121
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:57,130
This is just a regular... Why can I open this? I didn't soft lock it, did I? No. We're going to

122
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,730
make another pizza. Fuck. I think I did soft lock it. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

123
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:17,700
I can't get up there. Shit. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. There's dough in here. There's dough.

124
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:33,369
This is the dough machine. Insert container. Wait. Where's the dough? Dough. Fuck. I actually have

125
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:38,630
to start the whole thing over. I have to make the dough from scratch, but I don't know how to do

126
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,000
that yet. They didn't tell me how to do that. Okay. What if I just put like a... Okay. Hold on.

127
00:18:45,559 --> 00:19:14,309
Can I just put the tomato on here? Shit. I have to... Pepe D? All right. We're good. Oh, come on.

128
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:19,369
Yes. All right. We're fine. We're fine. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. All right. Get it in there.

129
00:19:19,369 --> 00:19:39,529
What is Pepe D? All right. Let's get some wood in there. No, don't do this already. What did I just

130
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:58,900
do? All right. That's fine. I have to reinstall... Oh. All right. Let's get it. Get that pizza out of

131
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:05,099
there. Eventually, I'm going to have wicked cool pizzas. Just you wait. Okay. Now, this time,

132
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm not going to mess this up. Here we go. Too early. Just a little too early. I kind of like

133
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:47,210
underdone sometimes. Be done? That was done, please. That shit was done. I don't like it raw.

134
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:58,700
Sometimes it can be nice. All right. On to the serving tray. Margarita pizza. All right. Nice.

135
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:09,160
Ingredients. Basil leaf. Triple check mark. Okay. Cool. You've proved that you can prepare a proper

136
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,960
Italian pizza. Now, it's time to prepare your pizzeria for tomorrow. Let me show you how to

137
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:22,039
prepare the dough, sauce, and other ingredients. Okay. You don't have to rush. Take your time. The

138
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,440
preparation phase has no time limit. You decide when to finish and when to start a new day.

139
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:33,619
I like that feature. Let's start with preparing some Neapolitan-style dough.

140
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:40,460
The first step is to familiarize yourself with the recipe. Launch the pizza pro app. I'm sorry. I did

141
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,940
the mid-sentence. That was weird. Launch the pizza pro app and find the recipe that we need.

142
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:58,220
Pizza pro app? What button is that on the keyboard? What button is that on the keyboard? Tab?

143
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:10,809
Okay. Pizza pro app. So now we need to open pizza pro. Select the recipe. All right. Here you find

144
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:15,420
a list of necessary ingredients and their quantities needed for the recipe. Clicking on the pin button

145
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,000
will allow you to view the recipe without well working on it. Yeah. Let's go back for a moment

146
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,359
to the quest villa app. Bring up the smartphone's main screen once more. Click on the app icon.

147
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,220
Don't worry. The recipe is going to stay pinned. Okay. The quest villa. This villa is an application

148
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:45,369
dedicated to the elite world-class pizzalios. Is that a Warcraft zone? No contract today!

149
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:59,819
Here you'll find some challenges. It's a battle pass. It really is a battle pass. It was a bad

150
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,019
joke. Oh, I'm not trying to make a good joke. I was just trying to make a wow reference because

151
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:11,420
I get to. Jerma bought Shadowlands. Time that guy up. I don't want to hear him. Here you'll find some

152
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,500
challenges and tasks that allow you to improve your skills and gain new abilities. Battle pass.

153
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,140
Completing these quests will grant you fame, respect, and skill certifications.

154
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,359
I need to learn how to do dough first. We're not getting involved in this. Hide him, hide him,

155
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:36,490
hide him. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will grant you the title of novice pizzalio. How do you even say

156
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,609
that word? Let you run the pizzeria by yourself. Additionally, by completing tasks from the app,

157
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:49,000
you'll unlock new recipes and ingredients. So it's well worth the effort. Okay. At the bottom

158
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,400
of the screen, you'll see a key that describes the elements of the app. After you familiarize

159
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:01,799
with the app, press tab to put the smartphone down. Okay. Quest progression. I just want to

160
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:16,380
make a pizza. Okay. Necessary ingredients and tools. So I need flour, water, sugar, salt, oil,

161
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,329
garlic, butter, and baking soda. I don't know. Whatever it is. Before you turn on the machine,

162
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,339
you must add the ingredients to the machine's bowl. Let's start with flour. You'll need it.

163
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:35,369
You'll find it on the shelf behind you. One bag of flour should be enough. Try not to go bankrupt.

164
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:39,450
Everything in the kitchen costs money. Plates, products, especially repairs. Don't take more

165
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,990
than you need and keep an eye on your balance. You're out of business if you run out of money.

166
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:56,789
All right. Let's dump it in there. How much do we need? 3.5 kilograms. All right. Add to the bowl.

167
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:07,130
Holy shit. How much did I just put in? I thought I put in a lot more than I needed to. All right.

168
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:26,710
Easy, easy, easy. Easy. Come on. Do it. 3.5. Yes. Okay. Put this away. Now, flour is very important.

169
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:35,140
It's not the only one. You'll find the rest in the box. Buy them and add proper amounts of each.

170
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:59,609
In the box? You'll find the rest in the box. What box? Oh, okay. Yeast. Do I need liquid? I need

171
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:10,390
water? Okay. How much water should I buy? A lot. Okay. I need water, salt. Water, salt, and yeast.

172
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:25,799
Buy it. Okay. Use piss. We're not even 10 minutes into the game. Just hold that thought.

173
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:40,519
What was it? Water, yeast, and what? What was it? Water, yeast, and what? Salt. Okay. So now we have

174
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:47,960
to put in... I can't see what the... I want to see the recipe. Okay. Salt. It's 2.4 liquid milliliters

175
00:26:47,960 --> 00:27:25,380
of water. That's all that's in here? Why is this... That's only one liter of water? Oh, god damn it.

176
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:32,809
Come on. How many... Why don't I have a bigger... Use the sink? I could... Yeah, but that's low quality.

177
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:41,799
I need to use... I'm not gonna use tap water. I'm using bottled water. That's the secret recipe.

178
00:27:43,259 --> 00:28:12,009
You're in Europe though. Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. The water's clean here. Is there water in this? No.

179
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:19,029
How am I not even... I don't even have a bottle I can put this in. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

180
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:33,130
I already paid for this. Whatever. 2.4. Good. It's okay. All right. Now we need salt. How much salt

181
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:39,740
do we need? I don't... We need 125 grams of salt. When preparing sauces and doughs, we often use a

182
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,539
lot of spices. That's why our shakers are equipped with double action covers. You can pour one gram

183
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:55,529
or 10 grams of spice with a single shake. All right. So I want... I want 10 grams. 125 grams.

184
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:21,690
Bingo. Yeast. Yeah, it's like a cube. Okay. This is 10 grams. Just put it in. Now mix it up. Oh,

185
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,890
this is my favorite part. This is my favorite part. All right. Now ready. Be careful now. Do not press

186
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:31,299
the red button. It will clear the bowl of its stored ingredients. Use it only if you make a

187
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,019
mistake. When preparing the dough from the recipe, or you've accidentally dropped something in the

188
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:42,250
bowl and can't remove it. No, chat. Chat, I'm not gonna press the button. I'm not gonna press the

189
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:58,759
big red button. No, chat, I'm not gonna do it. Press the green button. Nice. Okay. Let's discuss

190
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:02,920
sauces. Sauce recipes are located in the same app as the dough recipes. Just navigate to the sauces

191
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:13,509
tab and we'll make classic marinara. Okay. Sauces. Marinara. What was that?

192
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:26,680
Did we just throw a rock at the restaurant? Let's pin this. Okay. Quest tab. Okay. Okay.

193
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:35,720
Okay. What do we have here? We need some fresh vegetables. Time for a trip to the pantry.

194
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:47,740
Gas. Do not mix gas in the mixer. Not now. Oh, look at these little... These little poops.

195
00:30:47,740 --> 00:31:00,420
These little bread poops. Okay. Hold on. Pick up the basket. Gather 16 tomatoes. That's a lot.

196
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:34,950
Four garlic and then go back upstairs. Okay. 16 tomatoes. Okay. Holy shit. It's a 3D tomato.

197
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:51,829
Now how do we do this? No, no, no. Easy, easy. All right. Now what? Before you place the basket's

198
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:55,269
contents into the cooking processor, make sure you have the right ingredients in the correct amounts.

199
00:31:56,069 --> 00:31:59,589
After you fill the cooking processor, you will not be able to remove anything from it.

200
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:17,049
It's the cooking processor. Okay. Dump it in there. I need olive oil. Where do I get olive oil?

201
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:29,539
Just fill it up from the sink. No, it has to be oil. Okay. How about 200 milliliters of olive oil?

202
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:38,099
Where did the ingredients go? Oh, fuck. That comes out fast. It's okay. It's gonna be a little oily.

203
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:47,259
Salt. Okay. Salt, oregano, basil, and garlic. Salt, oregano, basil, and garlic.

204
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:53,140
Put down the basket. Look at it. You should see a list of contents. If you notice something that

205
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:04,019
shouldn't be there, take it out. Okay. Here's basil. We still need olive oil, herbs, and spices.

206
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:08,019
You'll find herbs in the herbarium. Since we're preparing almost two liters of sauce,

207
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:19,700
we'll need a lot of sprig. Okay. So we need how many sprigs of basil? 30 grams. All right. Put it

208
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:29,509
in there. Salt. Where's my salt shaker? I just had it. Right here. 35 grams. Open up. One, two,

209
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:39,400
three. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Fried oregano. I don't even have any oregano. He didn't

210
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:52,259
give it to me. Can't put the sponge in there? Come on. Where's the oregano? Get it from the sink.

211
00:33:52,819 --> 00:34:12,579
The herbarium. This is the herbarium. I only have basil. I have to buy it? Where is it? Basil,

212
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:23,190
oregano. Okay. There it is. All right. Let's go. 25 grams. One, two, one, two, three, four, five.

213
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:27,750
All right. Let's blend it up. I can't wait to make my secret fucking sauce because I have no idea.

214
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:37,699
We need to insert a GN container. Except for the dough mixer, all machines require an empty

215
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:43,909
GN container to be inserted where they can be activated. Take one of the empty GN containers

216
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,230
that you find lying around the kitchen and insert it into the cooking process's dump chamber.

217
00:34:50,739 --> 00:35:04,869
Okay. Turn it on. That sounded like it hung up a little. Okay. We don't need any more recipes.

218
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:14,420
Unpin them. Okay. It's going to take some time. Don't stand idly by here. Pick up the basket

219
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:32,630
and let's go back to the pantry. Okay. Where's the green line leading me to over here? All right.

220
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:41,000
I need olives, corn, salami, white onion, mozzarella. Is that good? Okay. Mozzarella,

221
00:35:45,059 --> 00:36:04,739
white onion, salami, sweet corn, olives. Where's the sweet corn? Where's the sweet corn?

222
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:14,579
Where's the sweet corn? I thought that was a big thing with cheese.

223
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:31,079
Garlic? Where's the sweet corn? I don't see this anywhere. Do I just keep glazing over it?

224
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:47,900
Corn? Onion? It's right there. Where is it? You just did it again. It's on the shelf?

225
00:36:49,269 --> 00:37:06,860
Oh, I'm looking for ears of corn. I'm not looking for canned corn. I'm looking for ears of corn.

226
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:15,059
He's throwing. No. No. Stand back up. Okay. The sauce should be ready.

227
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:27,019
Let's see what it looks like. Oh, it looks like raw meatloaf. What do I want to do over here?

228
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:38,150
Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is... Oh, this is from the other side. That's how they do this? Wow. I

229
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:52,179
didn't know that. Okay. Pick up the salami. Just put the salami over there. Put the salami into the

230
00:37:52,179 --> 00:38:08,090
cutter. Cool. All right. Turn on the salami cutter. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Use this one.

231
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:23,929
God, I wish that was me. The salami... You want your salami to be cut in the salami cutter?

232
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:38,920
What the fuck are you talking about? God, I wish that was me. Somebody...

233
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,510
Somebody... No. You know what? Time that guy out. Okay. Into the cheese grater.

234
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:59,980
Into the salami cutter. What the fuck? All right. Turn it on. Turn it on. Turn it on. Turn it on.

235
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:16,340
We're going to have our grated cheese. Nice. Nice mealworms. Pick up an onion. One onion.

236
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:43,019
Drop it up. Oh, shit. I need... I'm going to... I'm in the onions. Look at the basket. Shit. Wait,

237
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:52,090
wait, wait. I need... Is this a jar of pickles? I... Wait, wait, wait. I lost. I lost the...

238
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:04,409
Game thinks I did this already, but I hit the red button. All right. Here's another trick. Put an

239
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:08,250
ingredient into the automatic cutter. All ingredients of the same type in your basket will also get

240
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:28,980
thrown into the machine. Whatever. Okay. All right. Wait, wait, wait. I need to... Okay. Pick up the

241
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:39,699
basket with the ingredients. While holding the basket, use on the automatic cutter. Oh. Save a

242
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:48,599
lot of time and trouble with cutting large quantities. I'll turn it on. Wait, I need to...

243
00:40:48,599 --> 00:41:23,539
I'm going to have to buy like a thousand of these. Wait, pick this back. I can't get rid of the

244
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:31,030
onions? Pick up a can of sweet corn. No, I have to get rid of these. How do I get rid of this?

245
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:55,960
Okay. There we go. Pick up sweet corn. While holding the can, use it on the container.

246
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:08,219
Okay. Cool. Insert the GN container with sweet corn into the GN container shelf.

247
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:18,949
Okay. Hover over the jar of black olives. Try not to throw up while you do that. Okay. From left to

248
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:24,900
right, the icon... Wait. Put this... Okay. From left to right, the icon represents dough mixer,

249
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,630
cooking processor, electric grater, automatic cutter, and GN container. The last icon means

250
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,150
that the ingredient can be stored directly into a GN container without the need for any further

251
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:42,599
processing. Insert a GN container with 500 grams of black olives. Cut into the GN container shelf.

252
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:09,989
Shit. Okay. Now we need a GN container. Chop them up. Put it into the GN container shelf.

253
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:28,900
Very cool. Pick up a dough tray with click. All right. Follow the green line. All right.

254
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,860
Now we can prepare our dough for the day. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't waste time.

255
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:43,849
Pull the GN container shelf back into the yellow room. Hey, look at that. That's all my stuff.

256
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:57,670
What are the marked area? Oh, that's it. All right. Let's finish this up.

257
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:20,090
That's not what I wanted to do. I was trying to drink it. Are you throwing glass at people?

258
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:34,949
There's nobody out here. There's no trash can. Yes, there is. Well, whatever. I'm prepared.

259
00:44:34,949 --> 00:44:49,530
All right. How do we do it? Click on the clock. What time is it? I don't know.

260
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:03,159
Call an ambulance. I'm bleeding. That was a pretty good first day of preparing our pizza show.

261
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:09,590
All right. Here we go. Time to make pizzas. Complete the tasks that I've prepared for

262
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:15,019
you today and I'll grant you a novice pizzioleia certificate along with this pizzeria. Let's start.

263
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:23,559
Okay. Quest. Finish all the quests to unlock quantity, quality, and speed specializations

264
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:31,030
in their respective challenges. You must fulfill an order. Accept a new order, prepare the pizza

265
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,110
according to the client's expectations, and serve it. That's all there is to do it. Don't worry.

266
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:42,940
I'll give you a few tips if you have any problems. Okay. Notice you're only 50 EXP away from the next

267
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,260
level. Completing this quest will result in leveling up. Hover over the basket to check

268
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:53,139
out the rewards that await you for achieving the next level. Put down the smartphone. Stop

269
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:59,289
using your phone. Put it down. In life. Don't lift it up at a restaurant. Don't lift it up

270
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:06,119
when you're just sitting around. Way less screen time. I have a screen time thing now on my app

271
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,760
and it's like, holy shit, I look at this phone like for three hours a day. That's way too much.

272
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:24,360
Put it down. I'm going to try to cut back. That's a minus two. That's not a joke. That is a public

273
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,920
service announcement to put your phone down. Each star can be bronze, silver, or gold quality,

274
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:37,750
depending on how well you prepare the pizza. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. The timer starts the moment you

275
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,670
accept the order. If you manage to complete it within 30 minutes, you'll earn a bronze star,

276
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:50,179
or else it's free. 10 minutes? That feels like I can do that pretty easily. While you're still

277
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:56,420
learning, do not worry about the time. All right. Well, whatever. Just give me a fucking order.

278
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:07,610
What is it? Orders can be accepted for only half an hour since the new day starts, but the guests

279
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:13,159
won't leave until they receive their pizzas, even if that means waiting. So wait, if you order a

280
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,880
pizza from this window at like 11 o'clock in the morning or 12 o'clock in the afternoon,

281
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,340
and you don't get it till like 10 o'clock at night, I feel like you'd complain about that.

282
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:29,050
That's not okay. This pizzeria is really busy, so don't worry about running out of orders.

283
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:42,099
It's never happened. Okay. Okay. Let's go. New order. A pugilis. Your first order. Launch the

284
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:52,860
Bellapizza app and check it out. Pugilis. The timer's already running. Okay. A pugilis is a

285
00:47:52,860 --> 00:48:00,820
medium pizza. It's a Neapolitan style. Hold on. I gotta read this. How much of those the client

286
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,610
wants? Sometimes some of those categories will be blank. That means that a customer does not want

287
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:15,559
cheese on their pizza if it's blank. All right. Let's go. The arrow buttons next to the dough

288
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,800
and sauce type will switch your view to their recipes. Unfortunately, we prepared everything

289
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,360
we needed yesterday, so we don't need recipes. Okay. I already made marinara. I already have

290
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:30,659
Neapolitan style dough. That's a lot to remember, but you can pin the order. Yeah. Okay. Will you

291
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:39,619
fuck off, Chef Boyardee? I'm busy. We start with the dough, and as you might have noticed,

292
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:45,900
the order specifies a pizza size. That was rude. You won't leave me alone. I'm trying to run a

293
00:48:45,900 --> 00:49:02,260
pizza place. You're rude to tutorial guy. He's helping. I just want to make my pizzas. You need

294
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:13,030
him. I don't need him. Toxic streamer. I'm not toxic. I'm not. No. Turn that toxicity down.

295
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,710
He invented the pizza. I got a timer running. I got a timer, and I got to go. Okay. Where's my

296
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:26,469
dough? Where's my dough? Where's my dough? Where's my dough? I've over a large lump of dough. Where's

297
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:38,150
my... Okay. Press Q while hovering. Press Q. What? No, this is large. Oh, shit. This is too big.

298
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,550
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

299
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:49,159
give me, give me. Okay. Q, you can split it. The order requires you to make a medium-sized pizza.

300
00:49:49,159 --> 00:50:00,730
Combining two small lumps will give you a medium dough lump. Okay. Let's go. Rolling into a medium

301
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:16,599
size pan pizza. Okay. Needs well-baked to achieve a gold star. All right. Customers usually do not

302
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:29,400
like dry, sauceless pizza. Why would I serve sauceless dry pizza? Those are crackers. Yeah,

303
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,139
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Good. Cool. Sauce. Marinara. How much marinara do you

304
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:46,500
want? Well, this is how much you're getting. Really bad place for a save point. Okay. Good,

305
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,840
good, good, good, good, good. All right. That looks good. The cheese rating consists of three

306
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:59,590
factors. Saltiness, creaminess, and suppleness. Don't worry. If you lose a little too much cheese,

307
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:07,130
the customers will be happy either way. Whatever. As long as they don't go bankrupt. Sure. When you

308
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,489
shove the pizza in the oven, the cheese will begin to melt. Customers expect that the whole surface

309
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:18,869
of the pizza will be covered by melted cheese. Okay. What kind of cheese do you want? All right.

310
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:24,329
Mozzarella. You want cut mozzarella? How much mozzarella do you want? 100 grams? How many do

311
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:43,460
I have? What do I have my hand right now? 20. There. Now you're gonna be really happy when you

312
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:54,659
eat this pizza. Okay. This is just how they serve food at like the Disney resorts.

313
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:01,559
Spread out evenly on the pizza. Maintain the proper quantity of each ingredient. You'll find

314
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,610
this information in the details. The final score is an average is value based on the quantity and

315
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,539
the distribution of each ingredient. The better you fail, the better the star you'll get. Let's

316
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:16,739
start with the onion slices. Some ingredients are too small or used in such large quantities that

317
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:20,260
the exact placement doesn't matter. Instead, we just scatter handfuls onto the pizza. Okay.

318
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:30,619
Onions. What the fuck? Pop the pizza with 32 grams of white onions?

319
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:41,880
That doesn't look good. All right. That's 32. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

320
00:52:41,880 --> 00:53:04,710
Decorate the pizza with with some olives. Olives. Is it going on the pizza? Oh shit. Okay. Gross.

321
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:13,159
Gross. Gross. They look like Oreos. Now we have to bake it. All that's left. Raw pizza with solid

322
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:19,380
chunks of cheese will be rated poorly, but burned pizza won't steal any hearts either. It's best to

323
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,699
prepare a plate for the pizza. Take on from the stack. The pizza size is medium, so we need a

324
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:51,130
medium plate. Okay. What? This is going to be good. This is going to be real. It's going to be good.

325
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:08,469
Oh, fire it up. I didn't fire it up. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More. More.

326
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:24,019
All right. I don't want it to be too hot. Do the stream in Italian. I don't. I can't speak

327
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:32,889
Italian. Why do you think I can speak Italian? I can't. I don't know. I don't know any Italian.

328
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:43,079
Oh my God. I can't wait. Oh, it's going to be so scrumptious. You can't speak Italian. Why not?

329
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:58,179
Because I don't know. I didn't learn Italian. I've always wanted to go to Ili. Okay. It's not. Get

330
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:15,849
it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. It's going to burn. Get it. Ah, looks pretty awful. Bravo.

331
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:31,800
Let's see what the customer has to say. What do you think? Here you go. Eat up. I did it in seven

332
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:51,449
minutes. Oh, I can unlock prosciutto. Mm. Mushrooms. Chicken breast. And sausage. Allows you to

333
00:55:51,449 --> 00:56:07,739
replace a quest with a new random one up to three times. Uh, yeah. Bravo. Can I not choose a new

334
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:22,460
perk? Let's see what your customer is. All right. How do I get out of here? What the hell is going

335
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:29,190
on? All right. I previously mentioned you will choose a perk every third level. Okay. Unlock perks

336
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:39,019
can be activated and deactivated at the perk app. Okay. Take a look at the wall next to the serving

337
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:43,739
window. This is a certificate proving that I granted you the rank of a novice pizzialio.

338
00:56:43,739 --> 00:56:53,050
Magnificent, isn't it? I made it myself. Oh, okay. Thanks. Thank you. All right. New things in the

339
00:56:53,050 --> 00:57:01,050
quest app. Now, instead of just one quest, you'll have three active quests, each one of them belonging

340
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:14,550
to a different specialization. Um, okay. You got a participation award. It's kind of- whatever.

341
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,059
The speed specialization focuses on, you guessed it, performing various tasks very- why is there a

342
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:33,500
talent tree in this game? We're making pizzas. There's, like, skill points? All right. There's

343
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:42,199
speed. There's quantity. There's quality. Okay. There's quality. You can- you can- you can unlock

344
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:49,349
different skill points. Complete all three master tier challenges to become a pizziollo supreme.

345
00:57:49,989 --> 00:58:00,889
I never did it myself. All right. We finally made it out of the tutorial. Let's go. What do you got?

346
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:19,510
Any orders? No orders. How do I get an order? Waiting. Didn't you say this place was busy?

347
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:38,260
I ordered two hours ago. Oh, wait. I want a marinara pizza. I want a marinara pizza.

348
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:48,280
Medium dough. Marinara. Garlic and basil. You got it. Garlic and basil. Medium. This is going to be

349
00:58:48,280 --> 00:59:22,579
quick as hell. Okay. Marinara. Why is it green? Okay. Marinara. And- oh, give me that. Garlic.

350
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:31,320
Do I have any garlic? Oh, should I have sweet corn? No, I don't have any garlic. Oh, no. I didn't

351
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:39,860
prepare. I didn't prepare. I didn't prepare. Where's the garlic? I need garlic. Oh, shit.

352
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:49,619
Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Garlic. Give me one. Give me. Okay. How much does he want?

353
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:58,699
Dude, how much garlic do you want on this pizza? I gotta cut it up too. Shit. Oh, no. I need a

354
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:20,820
basket. This dude wants like 10 cloves of garlic on his pizza. Give me the basket. All right. I

355
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:28,260
got- I got a lot. I got enough. Ow. All right. Chop it up. Put it into the cutting machine.

356
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:34,630
Way too much. No, no. I'm gonna put it in a- in a GN tray. I got this. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got

357
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:52,170
it. I got it. I got it. Where's the GN tray? I need it. Oh. There's like none in here.

358
01:00:54,329 --> 01:01:00,300
Okay. Let's go, go, go. Where's the basil leaf? Basil leaf. 30 grams. Give me one.

359
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:26,119
Here we go. Garlic. He wants 24 grams of cut garlic. 32. All right. All right. We're good.

360
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:33,030
We're good. And then he wants basil leaf? Do I have to cut the basil leaf? How do I put this on

361
01:01:33,030 --> 01:02:02,250
here? I have to cut it? How do I cut the basil? Don't cut it. Well, I can't put- I won't let me

362
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:11,380
put it on the pizza. Basil leaf. Hold on. Okay. Basil leaf. With a knife. I don't- I don't think

363
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:16,500
I can do that. With a knife. That wasn't in the tutorial. Grandpa didn't tell me how to do that.

364
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:40,119
Where do I- Where do I get a knife? It's on there. All right. Does he want cheese on this?

365
01:02:40,119 --> 01:03:01,639
No, he didn't even want cheese. Get it- Okay. Go, go, go, go, go. Give me this fucking thing.

366
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:24,389
All right. We're- Herb selection? Oh, Jesus. Get it in. All right. I can take another order.

367
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:31,780
How are we doing on heat? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just leave everything in there until I'm

368
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:38,760
ready to heat everything up. Where's the garlic? I covered- I smutted it in garlic.

369
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:46,659
There's so much garlic on that pizza. You'll throw up if you eat it. All right. What we got?

370
01:03:46,659 --> 01:03:54,170
That one's going in there. That one's good. Next up, we got a salami pizza. Small salami- All right.

371
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:59,750
Get away from me. A small salami pizza with just mozzarella, salami, and basil. I got it.

372
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:25,670
Small. I want a small. How do I get- How do I make this a small? Oh, shit. I'm losing heat. Hold on.

373
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:43,269
The pizza's not burning. It's fine. I thought there were bugs on it. All right. Here you go.

374
01:04:50,539 --> 01:04:56,619
That's not what I wanted to do. Oh, Jesus. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I gotta put it on a plate.

375
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:11,099
Just pick it up with my hands. I don't even care. You fucking stupid ass. Oh, my God, dude. Stop.

376
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:27,940
Stop, stop. There's no counter space. Oh, what the fuck, man? Come on.

377
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:42,860
All right. We're good. We're good. We're good. Here. Serve it. Ding. That is the marinara pizza.

378
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,500
How'd you like it? All right. I gotta get to work on this. I need a small.

379
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:57,769
I unlocked Alfredo sauce. Oh, shit. Oh, gotta get the bacon. Buffalo mozzarella. All right. Close this.

380
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:26,389
Medium dough. I can't split it to a small. Oh, there's a small right there. Okay. Let's go. Okay.

381
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:33,219
And you wanted what? Let's pin it. You wanted a little bit of mozzarella cheese.

382
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:49,059
I guess. Mozzarella cheese? Only 16 grams. That seems like not very much. Oh, shit. Oops. Okay.

383
01:06:49,059 --> 01:07:00,070
Hold on. How much marinara? Marinara. It'll be a surprise. Okay. There's your marinara.

384
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:05,210
There's your mozzarella cheese. You need some salami. I know the salami in here somewhere.

385
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:17,610
There it is. Cut salami. I'm gonna do it this cool though. No, I need to be able to put more

386
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:39,750
than that. And then basil leaf. Okay. Basil. How much basil? There's more basil than salami on this

387
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:53,980
pizza. Oh, we want a grated mozzarella cheese. Uh oh. All right. Can I take it off? He won't even

388
01:07:53,980 --> 01:08:20,090
notice. Thousand kilograms of mozzarella. That sounds like a really cool band name.

389
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:40,250
You don't think that a what? A thousand kilograms of mozzarella is not a cool name for like a band?

390
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:55,659
Why not? How do I clean this? How is it a band name? I don't know. Name a band. Let's find out

391
01:08:55,659 --> 01:09:14,760
how weird the names are. Fallout boy. The Beatles. Oh, this is burning. Get it out. Get it out. Get

392
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:30,890
it out. Okay. Put it on a small plate. Coupleware remix party. If that's a real name for a band,

393
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:52,939
then how is mine any stranger? Jimmy eat world. Okay. Here we go. Take it. What do you think?

394
01:09:52,939 --> 01:10:02,569
It's next one. Oh, what's wrong? Oh, the cheese is wrong. Right. Whatever. Another marinara pizza.

395
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:22,010
This one is medium. Roll it out. So what did you want? I mean, I'm gonna, this one's gonna be

396
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:36,310
perfect. You want, let's pin this. Marinara. Let's get the marinara. I'm gonna do this as best as I

397
01:10:36,310 --> 01:11:02,460
can. I'm really gonna try as hard as I can. Okay. That's not bad. That could have been,

398
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:25,659
that could have been way worse. More sauce. Extra sauce. That looks good. Okay. Garlic.

399
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:35,720
Garlic. Get out of the way. You're in my way. Please get out of the way. Out. All right. I'm

400
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:47,979
gonna do this the way that I would want it. I like it in little clusters. I can't do that though.

401
01:11:47,979 --> 01:12:02,229
I have no more garlic left. Shit. Uh, give me this goddamn basket. We're gonna fill this thing to

402
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:18,789
the brim with garlic. Raid, grate your, I'm not, I'm not gonna say that out loud. That's insane.

403
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:33,300
What you just said. I love garlic though. I'm totally cool with this. Uh, I need one of those

404
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:53,510
things. There we go. That's much better. All right. Garlic. That's it. No cheese or anything, huh?

405
01:12:54,069 --> 01:13:19,479
Okay. That's fine. Not much more, right? 32. Okay. And then a little bit of basil. 24. What are you

406
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:29,670
doing? What are you doing? Can I put one more? So I'm gonna put one more. I don't care. It looks

407
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:39,850
better. All right. Get it in there. Do you think the person's really gonna complain? They're gonna

408
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:46,869
get their pizza and go, excuse me. There was an extra basil leaf on here that I did not order.

409
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:53,000
Guys, if you order a bunch of shit on a pizza, they could probably hide bugs in it and you

410
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:15,319
wouldn't even know it was on there. You're not going to notice one basil leaf. Okay. Let's,

411
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:25,479
this is going to cook fast. I hope you never prepare food for anyone. I mean, very, come on,

412
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:56,489
very clearly playing cooking simulator, pizza sim. I, what just happened? I pressed, I pressed Q.

413
01:14:56,489 --> 01:15:17,300
Oh dear. Oh well. Burnt to fuck. Yeah, because I pressed Q. Why, why, why is there an instantly

414
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:40,630
burn the pizza button? What, what's that for? It was a zero, apparently. It was a zero. All right.

415
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:59,380
Do not mess this one up. Just do it. Just pin it. Let's go. You want a medium sized dough.

416
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:17,260
Shut the operation down. Okay. Baron arrow. We're closing for today? What? Oh shit. Hold on. I

417
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:30,970
forgot that we're at a restaurant. Okay. Let's, uh, mozzarella cut a hundred. Not bad. Okay.

418
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:47,239
What's next? Basil done. I'm going to see one 24. All right. Get it in there and don't screw this

419
01:16:47,239 --> 01:17:08,439
up. The freezer has been open the whole time in the basement. Did I open it? Did I do that? I did.

420
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:31,060
Oh shit. That's not good. It's done. It'll be done in a minute. It's not going to burn.

421
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:51,130
Just don't press the incinerate button. I just had, I just felt a sneeze coming on

422
01:17:51,609 --> 01:18:03,060
and I panicked and pressed every button on my stream deck. It's not burnt. It's fine.

423
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:18,460
I muted the game. Yeah. I press. Oh shit. It's still muted. Sorry. Yeah. I felt the sneeze

424
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:22,569
coming on. So I was like, I don't want to sneeze on camera. So I just went, I mashed my fingers

425
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:39,180
all over my stream deck to try to turn everything off. How is this burnt? It looks perfect. I was

426
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:46,039
going to just whip it over here, but I can't do that. All right. First day of my new pizza job

427
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:53,020
completed. Now prepare the ingredients for tomorrow. Ooh, this part's fun. Okay. Here we go.

428
01:18:55,479 --> 01:19:04,090
Where's it clean? Can I, how, how do I clean up? There's no trash.

429
01:19:04,729 --> 01:19:18,329
You only made two pizzas in a whole day. Yeah, but it's quality though. All right. Let's make some

430
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:44,949
dough. We need flour. Let me clean up first. This is hell. Make glass pizza. All right. Hold on.

431
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:51,510
I'm not going to serve glass pizza to somebody yet. And I say yet because you know, I probably

432
01:19:51,510 --> 01:20:06,520
eventually will. Psycho. You all know I'm going to make a glass pizza. What do you think? That's

433
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,760
like a rocket scientist that's at the stream for more than 10 minutes to know that somebody's

434
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:27,720
going to eat glass today. All right. Flour. Open. All right. What's it? I need the recipe.

435
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:45,029
Where is it? Okay. I want a dough. So it's, let's pin this. Okay. All right. It's 3.5 kilograms of

436
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:55,479
fiber. What if I just make a shitload of it? I'm going to do a double batch. So what if the,

437
01:20:55,479 --> 01:21:07,539
let's do double, just double the whole thing up. Okay. So 3.5, 3.5, so that's seven. Don't, don't,

438
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:15,770
don't, don't, don't. All right. Well, let me, let me, I gotta use tap water. Can't pick this up.

439
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:31,539
Okay. I need a container. Fire extinguisher into the dough. No, not yet. Put soap in there.

440
01:21:34,100 --> 01:22:16,819
Oh, here we go. Jug. Get down there. Don't break it. Do not break it. All right. Pour it in.

441
01:22:16,819 --> 01:22:43,930
2.4. That thing, that just turned into a blooming onion from Outback. Whatever. All right. I need

442
01:22:43,930 --> 01:23:00,619
salt. 125 grams. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Easy, easy, easy. Not that much salt.

443
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:10,170
We want a blooming onion. You really don't though. Cause it sucks. You order it. You eat three or

444
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:17,109
four little cloves and then you, nobody else at the table wants to eat it. You eat it with that

445
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:23,180
delicious blooming sauce. You eat five of them. And for some reason, you're one of the only people

446
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:27,210
at the table that's eating it. Cause you go to the Outback and you get the meme order

447
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:30,890
and everyone's like, I don't fucking want to eat that. And then like, oh, but let's get it.

448
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:43,500
Okay. Now I need yeast. And then you have that awkward moment where like the waiter or the

449
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:50,550
waitress comes over and two thirds of the blooming onion is still there after you've eaten your

450
01:23:50,550 --> 01:24:01,739
entrees. You guys are still picking at that? No, but I'm going to take this thing home.

451
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,960
I'm taking this thing home and I'm going to eat it in the microwave later.

452
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:22,810
I want to hit the red button. The green one. Okay. That's dough. I need, how much sauce do I have left?

453
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:33,350
I think I have enough sauce. Clean this place up. Close the windows. I don't want, I don't want

454
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:43,000
anybody looking in here. Okay. I have, I need some more dough. I need to really, I got to clean up.

455
01:24:43,000 --> 01:25:03,939
Let's make this place look like shit. I need to pick that. I have to pick this up. Hold on.

456
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:20,520
What are you doing? Come here. Where did they go? Go back to normal. Go back to normal.

457
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:36,279
Go back to normal. Back to normal. Why can I not pick this up? All right. No more advanced controls.

458
01:25:36,279 --> 01:25:59,340
Just give it to me. I'm trying to pick the dough up like this. No, just I'll pick it up with my

459
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:14,039
feet if I have to. Okay. Right now I'm doing the thing that, okay. Let's say, let's say you're like

460
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:18,920
a blanket falls on the ground or like a pillow is on the ground that you want, but you don't want

461
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,319
to bend over. So you just reach over with your foot and you scrunch your toes around the blanket

462
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:31,619
and you pull it up. I'm not actually doing that with this. I'm just saying that's like what it

463
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:43,579
reminds me of. I got plenty of dough now. Plenty of dough of various shapes and sizes. Lots of dough.

464
01:26:43,579 --> 01:27:03,659
Let's put this back where it belongs. Okay. I already have one. I have two now. It's covered

465
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:14,260
in dust. How do I clean? That's what I want to know. I think I have enough marinara sauce for

466
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:32,600
tomorrow. I need a little container here. Can I put glass in here? I can't. I definitely I'm

467
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:57,659
going to get cut by this. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Throw it away. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? D minus

468
01:27:57,659 --> 01:28:05,369
rating from the inspector? Oh, I don't think so. I haven't poisoned anybody yet. Come back next week.

469
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:24,729
Okay. Let's go over here. Note to self. Let's make a really clear note of this. No more breaking stuff

470
01:28:24,729 --> 01:28:30,890
on the ground. I don't care how funny it is. No more breaking shit. Because look at how much I'm

471
01:28:30,890 --> 01:29:04,489
painting the ass this is. Where's the sponge? Sponge. Oh, nice. Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.

472
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:26,310
Clean up the pee. I got a clean area. Make sure to clean those vegetables. Clean the meat. I think

473
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:57,880
I'm ready for tomorrow. All right, new day. New day. I'm 800 in the green. I'm doing fine.

474
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:09,289
All right, I'm going to try to get at least five pizzas done today. Here we go. Let's go.

475
01:30:09,289 --> 01:30:18,300
Give me five. Give me five. Let's go. Go, Go, Go. Give me the app. All right. We got

476
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:32,180
two margaritas, marinara, we've got medium dough, medium, medium, medium, small, medium. All right,

477
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:35,520
All right, we got four mediums and a small.

478
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:41,579
Medium, medium, done.

479
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:43,619
Medium.

480
01:30:43,619 --> 01:30:44,439
Is that a small?

481
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,279
Okay, we're good.

482
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:46,119
Ready?

483
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:48,069
Go, go, go, go, go.

484
01:30:48,069 --> 01:31:00,859
They all have sauce.

485
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:03,069
Why is this one small?

486
01:31:03,069 --> 01:31:05,189
Shit, can I just like bunch up dough and throw it on top?

487
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:09,930
All right, with the two smalls?

488
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:13,800
Sauce.

489
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:18,199
The sauce looks like brown.

490
01:31:18,199 --> 01:31:19,039
Done?

491
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:24,060
Sauce.

492
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:38,460
Sauce it up.

493
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:39,279
Pull it back.

494
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:40,869
What else?

495
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:41,710
We got two smalls.

496
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:42,529
Unpin this.

497
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:45,189
Why is it still here?

498
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:46,270
All right, so this is a medium.

499
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,470
We got marinara.

500
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:50,180
We need garlic, basil.

501
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,020
What are the other ones?

502
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:55,819
Garlic, basil, mozzarella.

503
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:59,989
So, okay, we need garlic, basil, mozzarella, cut.

504
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:04,720
Garlic, basil, mozzarella, cut.

505
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,220
All right, put your head down here.

506
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:11,210
Garlic.

507
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:13,850
Where are you putting your head, man?

508
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:19,710
Okay, garlic.

509
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:20,710
24, right?

510
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,569
32.

511
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:23,390
Garlic.

512
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:24,229
Is there garlic on this one?

513
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:28,420
Garlic, basil.

514
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:34,569
It's rosemary.

515
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:37,619
This person didn't even want cheese.

516
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:41,800
All right, we have garlic, basil, marinara.

517
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,640
Done.

518
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,409
This one's done.

519
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:53,840
This one is mozzarella, cut, basil.

520
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:54,880
That's a lot of cheese.

521
01:32:54,880 --> 01:33:00,140
All right, and basil.

522
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:00,979
Done, done, done, done, done, done.

523
01:33:00,979 --> 01:33:03,779
What is this one?

524
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:05,819
This is the second small.

525
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:09,560
What's the other small one?

526
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:16,140
Medium, medium, medium.

527
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:46,510
There's only one small.

528
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:48,090
I can't.

529
01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:49,689
I'm gonna, who cares?

530
01:33:49,689 --> 01:33:53,909
Fucking free pizza for the seagulls.

531
01:33:53,909 --> 01:34:04,739
Okay, medium.

532
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,760
Can you imagine being at a pizza restaurant?

533
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,779
You're out like on the pier or something in Italy,

534
01:34:09,779 --> 01:34:13,640
and all of a sudden, the guy's screaming in the kitchen.

535
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,260
The fucking windows fly open.

536
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,560
Fucking small.

537
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,760
He's like, this one's for the seagulls.

538
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:24,960
And he just slingshots a pizza out the window.

539
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,760
Holy shit, this guy's nuts.

540
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,680
We gotta get out of here.

541
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:30,500
Why?

542
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:31,340
It said medium.

543
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,930
Pick it up.

544
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:34,609
Wait, add, add, add, add.

545
01:34:34,609 --> 01:35:01,609
Oh my God.

546
01:35:01,609 --> 01:35:02,449
Why?

547
01:35:02,449 --> 01:35:03,649
Is this a medium?

548
01:35:03,649 --> 01:35:05,850
What the fuck does he keep doing this for?

549
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,760
It's for the ants.

550
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,779
Okay.

551
01:35:17,779 --> 01:35:22,329
Medium, salami, right?

552
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:45,329
This is marinara, grated mozzarella, salami, and basil.

553
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:49,199
Grated mozzarella, basil.

554
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,149
Grated mozzarella.

555
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:57,869
More, more, more, more, more.

556
01:35:57,869 --> 01:35:59,310
That's it, 64.

557
01:35:59,310 --> 01:36:10,079
Get him in the oven, I'm done.

558
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,869
Oh, I forgot the salami.

559
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:15,689
Hold on, hold on.

560
01:36:15,689 --> 01:36:18,029
Forgot the salami.

561
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:35,380
How much salami did you want?

562
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:49,380
All right, get him in.

563
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:52,229
Damn, you're thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.

564
01:36:52,229 --> 01:37:02,659
Thanks.

565
01:37:02,659 --> 01:37:05,750
That's a Reddit joke?

566
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,590
I don't know.

567
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:11,529
I'm just, I don't know what that is.

568
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:13,189
Wait, what?

569
01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:22,229
I can only have two pizzas in the oven at the same time?

570
01:37:22,229 --> 01:37:23,069
All right, well, wait, wait, wait.

571
01:37:23,069 --> 01:37:23,909
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

572
01:37:23,909 --> 01:37:24,729
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

573
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:27,640
There's three, I have two more pizzas to make.

574
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,750
All right, just low and slow, low and slow.

575
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:30,989
Low and slow, low and slow, low and slow,

576
01:37:30,989 --> 01:37:32,649
low and slow, low and slow.

577
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:52,100
Medium, medium, medium.

578
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,439
That's not how pizza works?

579
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:56,819
It is here.

580
01:37:56,819 --> 01:38:03,630
Okay, everybody, it's all marinara.

581
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:04,590
Fuck it, whatever, I don't care.

582
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,430
You're gonna eat it just, look,

583
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:09,229
you'll enjoy the Nickelodeon splat of marinara sauce.

584
01:38:09,229 --> 01:38:10,789
I don't care.

585
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:15,649
Now what?

586
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:17,680
I lost track of which one is which.

587
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:21,869
Marinara, this one is garlic.

588
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:24,270
Oh shit, hold on.

589
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:26,569
They're all garlic and basil.

590
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:32,170
That's all we make here.

591
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:33,409
It's just garlic and basil.

592
01:38:33,409 --> 01:38:39,939
We don't make anything else.

593
01:38:39,939 --> 01:38:41,699
All right, just put garlic and basil on everything.

594
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:44,229
Who cares?

595
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:48,289
Wait, the pizza's burning?

596
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:51,760
No, they're not, low and slow.

597
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,909
All right, garlic.

598
01:38:54,909 --> 01:39:03,590
That's onion.

599
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:12,640
Okay, basil.

600
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:17,590
Okay, that's good.

601
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,430
Garlic, basil, garlic, basil.

602
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:20,550
I did extra garlic, but it's okay.

603
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:28,270
All right, get them in there.

604
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:34,960
One needs cheese.

605
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,079
This one.

606
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:41,539
One of them wants, okay, that's garlic and basil.

607
01:39:41,539 --> 01:39:52,460
Cut mozzarella, 100.

608
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,789
Okay, how are we looking?

609
01:39:54,789 --> 01:39:55,609
All right, get it out.

610
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:05,140
These are two mediums, two medium-sized pizzas.

611
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,300
Why is there a sponge in the way?

612
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:18,510
Get the sponge out of here.

613
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:19,350
Okay, here they come.

614
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:21,579
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

615
01:40:21,579 --> 01:40:27,569
All right, they're ready, go.

616
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:28,409
Looks good.

617
01:40:28,409 --> 01:40:29,229
It looks good, it looks good, it looks good.

618
01:40:29,229 --> 01:40:30,909
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

619
01:40:30,909 --> 01:40:38,439
Okay, get the other one quick, quick, quick, quick.

620
01:40:38,439 --> 01:40:40,439
All right, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

621
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:41,560
Let them cool, they gotta rest.

622
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:44,819
It's like meat that you take out of the oven.

623
01:40:44,819 --> 01:40:51,699
All right, next going in, we have the small.

624
01:40:51,699 --> 01:41:12,899
Where's this pizza go?

625
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:16,100
Where's the small pizza that I made?

626
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:29,500
Oh, whatever, fuck it.

627
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:37,060
The rats took it.

628
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,369
Oven's still hot.

629
01:41:39,369 --> 01:41:42,229
It's funny how stupid I am.

630
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:47,890
This was resting on the stool with the pizza on top of it.

631
01:41:47,890 --> 01:42:01,470
It's just not there anymore.

632
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:02,710
This shit's gonna be cold.

633
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:05,689
Fuck, okay, let's go.

634
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:10,409
This is pepperoni, basil, and salami.

635
01:42:10,409 --> 01:42:11,250
Take it.

636
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:16,930
This one is, all right, level up.

637
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:20,060
I can move faster.

638
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:20,899
All right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

639
01:42:20,899 --> 01:42:22,810
Okay, I don't care.

640
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:29,199
This one is garlic and basil, medium.

641
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:34,180
Medium garlic and basil, go.

642
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,989
All right, thank you.

643
01:42:38,989 --> 01:42:45,170
What happened to that small pizza?

644
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:46,170
I don't know, why I thought it was gonna be under there,

645
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:47,489
like a chewed gum.

646
01:42:47,489 --> 01:42:53,619
What am I doing?

647
01:42:53,619 --> 01:42:59,140
It went and it fell into the trash.

648
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:01,340
Well, whatever.

649
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,180
Okay, so now I have,

650
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:14,229
I gotta make that small pizza again.

651
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:24,340
It's burnt?

652
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,899
This looks like shit.

653
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:31,409
It looks like somebody bled on that pizza.

654
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:32,770
Doesn't it look like sauce?

655
01:43:38,489 --> 01:43:40,899
It looks like cat puke.

656
01:43:40,899 --> 01:43:42,300
That's my special.

657
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:51,739
That's my cut arm and cat puke pizza.

658
01:43:51,739 --> 01:43:53,539
This is like how I slipped my hand open

659
01:43:53,539 --> 01:44:01,369
when I was making the pizza.

660
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:03,130
Shit, all right, all right, all right, all right.

661
01:44:03,130 --> 01:44:10,159
This one, what even was this one?

662
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,600
You have to make the noise now.

663
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:12,439
No, I can't.

664
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:29,069
You know what's weird about this pizza?

665
01:44:29,069 --> 01:44:33,670
This pizza looks like a lot of buffalo chicken pizzas

666
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,439
I've had before.

667
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:49,300
Why is it that people just can't do that?

668
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:51,630
Putting it back in.

669
01:44:51,630 --> 01:44:55,899
It was ready.

670
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:57,489
Oh shit.

671
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:01,329
This just looks like,

672
01:45:01,329 --> 01:45:05,619
this just looks like you hit M in an open world game

673
01:45:05,619 --> 01:45:12,300
and look at all these quests I have.

674
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:17,710
I need another plate.

675
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:18,989
Give me this damn thing.

676
01:45:18,989 --> 01:45:23,970
Oh my God, what the hell am I doing?

677
01:45:23,970 --> 01:45:27,369
Just, I just smashed that, don't.

678
01:45:27,369 --> 01:45:31,600
Okay, I smashed that plate into my face.

679
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,899
I don't even know what this pizza was.

680
01:45:33,899 --> 01:45:38,340
What was this pizza?

681
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,340
I don't even know, who ordered the chili?

682
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:48,380
That's disgusting.

683
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:51,470
I guess it wasn't margarita.

684
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,630
Okay, it was this one, I guess.

685
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,779
Oh, bon appetit.

686
01:45:54,779 --> 01:45:58,340
I enjoy your chili on your pizza.

687
01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:03,569
Oh, prosciutto, eggplant and cherry tomato.

688
01:46:03,569 --> 01:46:06,560
Hey, you still ate it.

689
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,319
Oh man.

690
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:11,539
Okay, what was the blood pizza?

691
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:14,020
That's just basil and garlic?

692
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,420
All right, let me take a look and see.

693
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:19,859
Let me just make sure I'm doing this right.

694
01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:22,380
This one is the medium that wants cheese on it.

695
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:33,739
Fuck, get that over here.

696
01:46:33,739 --> 01:46:58,850
I mixed them up.

697
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:19,100
Just put it on low, wait for the cheese to melt.

698
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:21,140
All right, is it ready, is it ready, is it ready?

699
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:23,239
All right, it's ready, get it.

700
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:26,140
Oh, look at that, look at that bubbly cheese.

701
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:42,579
Oh my goodness, the ooey gooey bubbly cheese.

702
01:47:42,579 --> 01:47:46,859
Actually kind of looks kind of good.

703
01:47:46,859 --> 01:48:06,640
Looks frozen, doesn't look frozen.

704
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:15,420
You know what, whatever.

705
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:26,409
Here, here, here, happy birthday.

706
01:48:26,409 --> 01:48:50,479
No, that was the, oh.

707
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:51,920
This is dough on top of, wait,

708
01:48:51,960 --> 01:49:28,779
can I do dough on top of the dough pizza?

709
01:49:28,779 --> 01:49:32,079
You take like, you go out for like a nice dinner

710
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:33,279
with like a significant other

711
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:37,000
or mother or parents or something or whatever.

712
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,560
You order a Neapolitan pizza

713
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:42,399
from a place that has apparently rave reviews.

714
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:47,109
This is like when we're in Italy, this is in Italy.

715
01:49:47,109 --> 01:49:48,949
This is gonna be delicious, we're in Italy.

716
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:55,260
This is where you get the best pizza like in the world.

717
01:49:55,260 --> 01:50:00,510
And this dude just gives you a burnt piece of bread.

718
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,710
Actually, Italy pizza is shit.

719
01:50:02,710 --> 01:50:09,699
What?

720
01:50:09,739 --> 01:50:17,579
I've never been, I don't know.

721
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:21,260
This place is a mess, I gotta clean this up.

722
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,340
After I put this in there

723
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:41,939
as long as it can go in there for.

724
01:50:41,939 --> 01:50:51,640
I'm gonna give it an extra toasted bun.

725
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:56,920
Oven is blocked, what?

726
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:07,619
I mean, oven is blocked by the bread?

727
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:13,890
All right, let's get it.

728
01:51:19,449 --> 01:51:31,550
It's still in there, looks like a pie crust.

729
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:34,750
Can I buy like cherries and blueberries and stuff?

730
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:07,090
It's, who ordered the caviar?

731
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:11,590
It's my special caviar pizza.

732
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:13,310
But it's the children's version

733
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:26,260
where it's not actually caviar, it's olives.

734
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,420
This is, okay, remember when like there would be things

735
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:31,069
where food would be gross for kids?

736
01:52:31,069 --> 01:52:35,810
Like, oh, it's brains, it's brains pizza.

737
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:36,689
That's just on the menu.

738
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:38,609
I have one of those like weird fucking menus

739
01:52:38,609 --> 01:52:39,729
where it's like you just get a bunch

740
01:52:39,729 --> 01:52:42,630
of olives all over pizzas.

741
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:47,590
This costs me, this is a piece of shit to make, right?

742
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:49,430
Well, like I can sell it because it's like,

743
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:54,270
oh, it's like bird shit, bird shit pizza.

744
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:55,390
Hey, hey, do you guys,

745
01:52:55,390 --> 01:52:58,710
hey kids, do you kids want to order the bird shit?

746
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:03,710
Oh, gross, yeah, here you go, here's one bird shit pizza.

747
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:06,500
Why do we do that?

748
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:11,579
Why, what's, I don't understand that, by the way.

749
01:53:11,579 --> 01:53:13,300
Why do we have like a gross shit

750
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:14,779
for like funny for kids menus?

751
01:53:15,619 --> 01:53:18,340
Oh, look, it's worms, you're eating worms.

752
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:22,489
I don't want people to think they're eating worms.

753
01:53:22,489 --> 01:53:25,449
When you eat spaghetti, why is it like, oh, hey, no, no, no,

754
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:27,369
hey, I'll make it cooler for you, kid.

755
01:53:27,369 --> 01:53:29,890
You're eating like fucking worms out of the ground.

756
01:53:29,890 --> 01:53:35,560
Oh, yes, mm, it's called spaghetti.

757
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:41,739
Here, who ordered the mussels?

758
01:53:41,739 --> 01:53:43,220
Would you really be pissed about that though

759
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,739
if you bought a pizza that was,

760
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:47,659
if you bought like an $8 pizza

761
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:50,699
and it came with like $70 of mussels on it,

762
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:52,979
are you gonna be that upset about it?

763
01:53:52,979 --> 01:53:57,100
I'd be like, are these cooked and are these good?

764
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:05,100
And whatever, let's have to make the pizza.

765
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:11,500
Oh, I kind of trashed this place.

766
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:24,260
Meat and veggie pizza.

767
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:28,489
Uh-oh, the game crashed, but it came back.

768
01:54:28,489 --> 01:54:34,109
All right, I don't have any Alfredo sauce.

769
01:54:34,109 --> 01:54:42,869
What the fuck, I gotta make Alfredo sauce.

770
01:54:42,869 --> 01:54:45,630
Butter, hold on, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,

771
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:50,460
butter, butter, I need one of these.

772
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:52,180
Okay, butter, 150 grams of butter.

773
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:59,079
Was the label still on?

774
01:54:59,079 --> 01:55:02,510
I think the package was still on, the wrapper was on.

775
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:06,949
Okay, butter, what else?

776
01:55:06,949 --> 01:55:26,260
Milk, okay, universal flour, 150.

777
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:31,630
Oh, fuck, okay, whatever.

778
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:46,869
We need salt, pepper, okay.

779
01:55:46,869 --> 01:55:51,539
How much pepper though, 10?

780
01:55:51,539 --> 01:55:52,779
We got a link, hold on, wait, wait, wait,

781
01:55:52,779 --> 01:55:54,779
I'll click, whoops, I clicked it too much.

782
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:56,819
And Parmesan cheese, I love Parmesan cheese,

783
01:55:57,659 --> 01:56:00,020
that's like my favorite.

784
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:01,819
All right, Parmesan cheese.

785
01:56:01,819 --> 01:56:12,439
Wait, that's downstairs.

786
01:56:12,439 --> 01:56:17,739
That's a lot of cheese, okay.

787
01:56:17,739 --> 01:56:22,859
I gotta grind it up, can I just put it in there?

788
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:37,659
Oh, shit, okay, what, what?

789
01:56:37,659 --> 01:56:42,789
All right, there it is.

790
01:56:42,789 --> 01:56:46,850
Who wanted this?

791
01:56:46,850 --> 01:56:50,180
Let me see what the link is, what's the link?

792
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:56,699
I've seen that before, this is old.

793
01:56:56,699 --> 01:57:06,409
This is old, I've seen it.

794
01:57:06,409 --> 01:57:10,069
Okay, now I need to make a,

795
01:57:10,069 --> 01:57:12,789
let's go back to the guy that wanted the actual,

796
01:57:12,789 --> 01:57:13,989
what does he want?

797
01:57:13,989 --> 01:57:16,720
All right, meat and veggie.

798
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,039
You wanted meat, what kind of meat?

799
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:21,659
Why can't I click this?

800
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:26,869
It's crashing again, wrong link?

801
01:57:26,869 --> 01:57:33,159
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

802
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:35,520
Don't crash, don't crash, don't do it.

803
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:41,119
Don't crash, don't crash, don't crash, don't, no.

804
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:47,800
No, yes, I think it's changing soundtrack.

805
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,710
It's heavy, huh?

806
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:52,710
Is this me lifting up like, what am I,

807
01:57:55,170 --> 01:58:00,899
whatever, okay, I'm moving, I'm playing this,

808
01:58:00,899 --> 01:58:03,739
I'm making pieces, I've got a timer.

809
01:58:03,739 --> 01:58:07,180
All right, Alfredo sauce, mozzarella, chicken breast.

810
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:09,260
I don't even have chicken breast.

811
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:12,619
Oh, God damn it, okay, hold on, chicken products.

812
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:19,319
Where do I get chicken?

813
01:58:19,319 --> 01:58:37,140
Oh, okay, okay, cut this up.

814
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:40,300
Wait, can I do grated chicken?

815
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:44,899
That's disgusting, like little shredded cheese chicken

816
01:58:44,899 --> 01:58:47,619
pieces, actually that's, that isn't disgusting,

817
01:58:47,619 --> 01:58:57,020
that's fine, there we go, okay.

818
01:58:57,020 --> 01:59:06,380
Now, SpongeBob, why do I hear SpongeBob's music?

819
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:16,699
Stop crashing when I click this info link, stop, why?

820
01:59:16,699 --> 01:59:24,000
Stop clicking it while I need to see, I gotta pin it.

821
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,760
You're making the subway trays.

822
01:59:27,949 --> 01:59:29,310
Just turn this place into a subway,

823
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:33,340
don't even do pizzas anymore, just do subway sandwiches.

824
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:36,260
Just line like four or five pieces of cold,

825
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:40,779
gross chicken strips, squeeze way too much mayonnaise

826
01:59:40,779 --> 01:59:43,939
and way too much mustard all over it.

827
01:59:43,939 --> 01:59:51,569
And then grab the container of wilted lettuce

828
01:59:51,569 --> 01:59:57,260
and then be out of all the cool breads.

829
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:00,819
Can I have it on the herb break, the cashew bread?

830
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:01,819
We don't have that.

831
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:04,180
Can I have it on a wheat and oregano?

832
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:05,579
We don't have that today.

833
02:00:05,579 --> 02:00:07,220
All right, can I have it on just default,

834
02:00:07,220 --> 02:00:09,899
fucking like sub bread?

835
02:00:09,899 --> 02:00:23,060
Sure, there's only cringe breads left, yeah.

836
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:25,880
The last time I went to Subway, I had the,

837
02:00:25,880 --> 02:00:28,159
it was one, I don't know, it was the last experience

838
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:29,600
I'll ever have there.

839
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,600
And I'm sorry this is gonna come off as I'm gonna sound

840
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,199
like elitist or something, I really don't mean to be.

841
02:00:34,199 --> 02:00:37,760
But when they take that, when they take that like

842
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:42,600
carnival fare container of chicken and cheese

843
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,079
that they melt in the microwave thing

844
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:47,060
and they dump it upside down onto the bread,

845
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:50,430
it's like in the French fry container from the carnival.

846
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:53,550
You know what I'm talking about?

847
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:54,989
It's this little paper container

848
02:00:54,989 --> 02:00:57,550
and then they turn it upside down like three times

849
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:05,220
and it's just this melted cheese and chicken mess.

850
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:06,859
And it was still, it was like somehow cold

851
02:01:06,859 --> 02:01:11,100
in the middle still, I don't know how.

852
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,760
We never went to the carnival?

853
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,199
Oh, really?

854
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:16,399
I love the carnival, you don't,

855
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:19,409
you've never been to the carnival before?

856
02:01:19,409 --> 02:01:20,850
This is a medium, right?

857
02:01:20,850 --> 02:01:21,850
No, it's a large.

858
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:24,739
This, dude, this is a large pizza.

859
02:01:24,739 --> 02:01:28,039
This is a big one.

860
02:01:28,039 --> 02:01:31,579
This is a meat lover's pizza?

861
02:01:31,579 --> 02:01:36,020
Okay, you want Alfredo sauce, which,

862
02:01:36,020 --> 02:01:51,369
what happened to my, okay, Alfredo sauce.

863
02:01:51,369 --> 02:01:53,369
I don't know why, but this reminds me of egg yolk

864
02:01:53,369 --> 02:01:56,050
and it's making me wanna just not make this anymore.

865
02:02:03,819 --> 02:02:08,829
Okay, that's Alfredo sauce, mozzarella, cut mozzarella.

866
02:02:09,989 --> 02:02:19,260
I think this would be too much, okay.

867
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:33,010
Chicken breast, 96 grams?

868
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:36,850
Hey, let's get somebody that's at this dinner party

869
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:37,930
the best bite.

870
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,300
You know what I mean?

871
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,140
This guy gets the good,

872
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,239
whoever gets that gets the good slice.

873
02:02:50,239 --> 02:03:01,800
And then basil leaf, and that's it.

874
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:10,760
All right, wrong sauce?

875
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,859
What are you talking about?

876
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:15,939
What about, you forgot, I forgot onion?

877
02:03:15,939 --> 02:03:21,810
We're closing for the day, oh shit.

878
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:23,130
I'm never gonna get that ever again.

879
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:24,529
I don't know why I did that.

880
02:03:24,529 --> 02:03:26,810
Oh, good thing there's a backup.

881
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:28,859
I forgot onions.

882
02:03:28,859 --> 02:03:31,810
Oh, white onion.

883
02:03:31,810 --> 02:03:47,739
White onion cut, 64, okay.

884
02:03:47,739 --> 02:03:48,739
All right, the next piece that I make,

885
02:03:48,739 --> 02:03:50,880
I'm gonna make just one slice be,

886
02:03:51,819 --> 02:03:54,220
I'm gonna have one slice have all the toppings on it

887
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:57,329
and everything else is gonna be bare.

888
02:03:57,329 --> 02:04:08,020
I'm talking sauce too, by the way.

889
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:12,220
Let's get through this day and clean up though.

890
02:04:12,220 --> 02:04:14,119
Sauce two waiting room.

891
02:04:16,619 --> 02:04:17,899
Sauce two.

892
02:04:19,489 --> 02:04:20,850
Why am I doing that?

893
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:27,220
I can't get them back.

894
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:30,079
I can't take this pizza out.

895
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:31,560
Oh, thank God.

896
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:47,819
It sucked to me, okay.

897
02:04:47,819 --> 02:04:51,060
I'm ready.

898
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:53,460
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

899
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:55,779
I want that pizza, give me the fucking pizza.

900
02:04:55,779 --> 02:05:12,819
Give me that fucking pizza.

901
02:05:12,819 --> 02:05:19,670
Almost ready.

902
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:21,470
Hey everybody, dinner's ready.

903
02:05:22,989 --> 02:05:24,430
Come and get it kids.

904
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:38,640
It's not burning, it's fine.

905
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:43,329
Look at that cheese bubbling up.

906
02:05:43,329 --> 02:05:45,539
Why is it frozen?

907
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:46,979
Every time I take a piece out of the oven,

908
02:05:46,979 --> 02:05:48,180
it fucking freezes.

909
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:56,529
What are you doing?

910
02:05:56,529 --> 02:06:00,479
Stop freezing, stop freezing.

911
02:06:00,479 --> 02:06:02,439
Why is it frozen?

912
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:08,239
Oh my God, okay.

913
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:14,079
Are you, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, okay.

914
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:16,119
It's really thinking about if it wants to load

915
02:06:16,119 --> 02:06:36,479
all the onions in the same spot.

916
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:41,300
Oh, wrong food, it was chicken, chicken breast.

917
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:54,930
That's correct.

918
02:06:54,930 --> 02:06:56,569
And 80 omega low.

919
02:06:56,569 --> 02:06:59,609
Yeah, I know, I know.

920
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:02,699
I was about to throw it out the window.

921
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:08,960
What?

922
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:24,810
I'm gonna go so slow.

923
02:07:27,359 --> 02:07:39,210
Okay, cool.

924
02:07:39,210 --> 02:07:41,050
Why won't it accept it, take it.

925
02:07:44,220 --> 02:08:03,270
What the fuck just happened?

926
02:08:03,270 --> 02:08:06,310
This is a major struggle going on right now.

927
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,119
Okay, okay, I don't know.

928
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:15,479
If my brain is a little fried,

929
02:08:15,479 --> 02:08:19,060
but I thought that was the health of the pizza.

930
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:32,789
Oh, I took down like 10% of its health.

931
02:08:32,789 --> 02:08:38,130
Okay, can we stop this nonsense, please?

932
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:41,300
Here you go, dang.

933
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,369
Meat and veggie pizza.

934
02:08:43,369 --> 02:08:48,779
Do you love it?

935
02:08:48,779 --> 02:08:52,539
You can't, you, I mean,

936
02:08:52,539 --> 02:08:54,060
I mean, I did as good as if I guessed

937
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,739
on every multiple choice question.

938
02:08:55,739 --> 02:09:04,590
So for me doing that, that did pretty good.

939
02:09:04,590 --> 02:09:10,920
Was the sauce was wrong, how?

940
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,939
I'm gonna make my own sauce.

941
02:09:12,939 --> 02:09:16,109
Yeah, I'm making my secret sauce.

942
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:23,539
Let's go, I'm making my secret sauce and secret dough.

943
02:09:23,539 --> 02:09:25,859
Let's see, it's gonna be tomatoes.

944
02:09:25,859 --> 02:09:30,229
Tomato, it's gonna be like a barbecue.

945
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:31,310
All right, here we go.

946
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:37,619
I want my basket.

947
02:09:37,619 --> 02:09:42,270
I'm gonna make my sauce.

948
02:09:42,270 --> 02:09:53,750
A little bit of garlic, a little bit of onion.

949
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:58,460
Lots of tomatoes, San Marzano tomatoes.

950
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:10,380
San Marzano tomatoes.

951
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:15,449
Okay, onions, garlic, oil, cheddar cheese.

952
02:10:15,449 --> 02:10:17,250
Cheddar cheese in there.

953
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:21,170
Oh, that's gonna be cheesy.

954
02:10:21,170 --> 02:10:23,520
Bacon for fat and flavor.

955
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,699
Milk for creaminess factor.

956
02:10:27,699 --> 02:10:32,069
Prosciutto for the fat.

957
02:10:32,069 --> 02:10:43,939
And then where's barbecue sauce?

958
02:10:43,939 --> 02:10:44,939
All right, you know how many times

959
02:10:44,939 --> 02:10:47,439
have you been in your own house

960
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:49,039
and you've done something like that?

961
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:50,640
Are you moving too fast or it's a little dark

962
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:52,479
and you just, ow, my face.

963
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:56,479
Oh, fuck, oh no.

964
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:08,390
Did I lose anything?

965
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:31,199
Oh, God damn it, just put it down.

966
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:32,199
Resident sleeper.

967
02:11:33,899 --> 02:11:35,060
Hey, don't say that.

968
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:43,649
Don't say that right now, come on, man.

969
02:11:43,649 --> 02:11:45,529
Why are 10K people watching this?

970
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:52,930
Because I showed my ass yesterday.

971
02:11:52,930 --> 02:11:53,770
That's why.

972
02:12:01,939 --> 02:12:02,779
True.

973
02:12:04,819 --> 02:12:07,800
Okay, so this is what I wanted to go in here.

974
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:12,979
All these ingredients, garlic, the onions,

975
02:12:12,979 --> 02:12:19,380
the cheese, the cheddar, the San Marzano tomatoes.

976
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:20,920
That was a good catch.

977
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:30,539
Now we put a little bit of milk in there.

978
02:12:30,539 --> 02:12:34,539
Milk, just a little bit.

979
02:12:34,539 --> 02:12:38,569
Okay, now I want the, okay, I got everything in there.

980
02:12:38,569 --> 02:12:39,449
I want a little bit of oil too.

981
02:12:39,449 --> 02:12:40,810
I want to make it nice and oily.

982
02:12:40,810 --> 02:12:47,659
Liquids, sunflower oil, make it thicker.

983
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:50,470
Oh, I can't fit anything in there.

984
02:12:50,470 --> 02:13:00,630
Wait, wait, there was already a bunch of shit in here.

985
02:13:00,630 --> 02:13:03,350
It already was milk, butter, flour, salt,

986
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:06,949
pepper, cheese, garlic, tomatoes, cheddar,

987
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:08,750
bacon, white onions, and prosciutto.

988
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:25,779
Okay, sure.

989
02:13:25,779 --> 02:13:28,140
Okay, what if I just do a fucking shitload

990
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:31,100
of butter and lard and that's the thing I put on pizzas?

991
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:41,399
Yeah, hold on, fuck this.

992
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:43,319
I don't understand.

993
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:50,500
You're making me angry.

994
02:13:50,500 --> 02:14:06,899
Okay, butter, butter, butter, butter, butter.

995
02:14:06,899 --> 02:14:08,939
Wasn't there a way for me to wipe out some of the debt

996
02:14:08,939 --> 02:14:12,109
to eat like 10 sticks of butter?

997
02:14:12,109 --> 02:14:15,109
That's, no one should ever do that, that's disgusting.

998
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:16,789
Like, why would you ever do that?

999
02:14:16,789 --> 02:14:19,670
That's not even like funny or fun, it's just horrible.

1000
02:14:19,670 --> 02:14:21,510
There's mayo, yeah, no, why would you do that?

1001
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:25,829
It would be so painful and horrible.

1002
02:14:25,829 --> 02:14:30,800
Okay, I have a sauce in here already.

1003
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:51,390
That's my secret sauce.

1004
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:53,069
All right, I gotta put my items over here

1005
02:14:53,069 --> 02:14:55,029
so I don't mix it up with the actual game items.

1006
02:14:55,029 --> 02:15:03,250
All right, let's go, butter, shitload of butter.

1007
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:05,729
No, no, no, wipe it out, wipe this whole thing out.

1008
02:15:05,729 --> 02:15:36,470
Wipe it out.

1009
02:15:36,470 --> 02:15:38,390
Butter and oil.

1010
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:47,130
Yeah, and I'm gonna put some like lemon in there too.

1011
02:15:47,130 --> 02:16:00,909
Okay, onion powder, salt, sugar, butter, sugar, flour.

1012
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:13,819
This is just cookie dough.

1013
02:16:13,819 --> 02:16:14,939
It's a cake.

1014
02:16:18,699 --> 02:16:20,100
It's like milk.

1015
02:16:22,439 --> 02:16:25,289
It's just cake.

1016
02:16:25,930 --> 02:16:30,130
Milk, sugar, butter, flour.

1017
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,899
That's okay, now let's get a tray.

1018
02:16:33,899 --> 02:16:36,950
Eggs, I don't think, I don't have access to any eggs.

1019
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:46,290
More sugar?

1020
02:16:46,290 --> 02:16:53,370
Are eggs in the freezer?

1021
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:55,100
Oh, that's mozzarella.

1022
02:16:55,100 --> 02:17:04,399
I mean, it looks like eggs, but it's not.

1023
02:17:04,399 --> 02:17:08,469
It's down here.

1024
02:17:08,469 --> 02:17:12,500
Nope, okay, close enough.

1025
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:20,899
Okay, one egg.

1026
02:17:20,899 --> 02:17:31,549
All right, let's go.

1027
02:17:31,549 --> 02:17:34,370
Does it have to be green?

1028
02:17:34,370 --> 02:17:39,649
It has a green tint to it.

1029
02:17:39,649 --> 02:17:46,940
Okay, let me actually, hold on.

1030
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:47,979
I need to clean up

1031
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,459
because I'm gonna lose track of all this shit.

1032
02:17:49,459 --> 02:17:50,620
Hold on, I got these tomatoes.

1033
02:17:50,620 --> 02:17:55,139
I'm gonna make more, how much more marinara?

1034
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:56,899
I got plenty of marinara.

1035
02:17:56,899 --> 02:17:57,899
I have enough cheese.

1036
02:17:57,899 --> 02:17:59,659
I got, I need more garlic.

1037
02:17:59,659 --> 02:18:06,969
I need more freshly chopped, cut garlic.

1038
02:18:06,969 --> 02:18:12,969
Gas in the sauce?

1039
02:18:12,969 --> 02:18:15,899
I can't.

1040
02:18:15,899 --> 02:18:19,829
I can't just add gas.

1041
02:18:19,829 --> 02:18:21,010
Can I?

1042
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:27,979
Woo hoo!

1043
02:18:27,979 --> 02:18:29,219
Get rid of this, get this away from me.

1044
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:31,579
Get this away from me, get it away.

1045
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:33,459
Get it out, get away from me.

1046
02:18:33,459 --> 02:18:44,680
Do not throw it.

1047
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:56,069
Yo, tray, gas in the oven.

1048
02:18:56,069 --> 02:18:58,149
No, I'm not at that point yet.

1049
02:18:58,149 --> 02:19:03,579
Sure, I will put the gas can in the bread maker

1050
02:19:03,579 --> 02:19:12,979
in like an hour or something, but not right now.

1051
02:19:12,979 --> 02:19:29,500
I wanna make a pizza for me.

1052
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:36,610
Okay, let's get this open.

1053
02:19:36,610 --> 02:19:39,250
Where's my homemade sauce?

1054
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:42,209
Okay, wait, what about?

1055
02:19:42,209 --> 02:19:56,159
Okay, butter, this is it, okay.

1056
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:03,190
All right, that's the sugar butter sauce.

1057
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:07,899
And you know what?

1058
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:10,829
Oh, the jug is gone, nevermind.

1059
02:20:10,829 --> 02:20:14,920
I lost the jug.

1060
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:43,270
Okay, now I want, now don't waste the marinara.

1061
02:20:43,270 --> 02:21:12,569
I need more chicken.

1062
02:21:12,569 --> 02:21:15,280
Why doesn't the streamer talk?

1063
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:17,239
What are you distracting me for?

1064
02:21:17,239 --> 02:21:30,500
I just dropped all my walnuts on the ground.

1065
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:37,020
All right, put, get them in here.

1066
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:40,170
I'm just trying to prepare for tomorrow.

1067
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:42,010
I have to actually make the Alfredo sauce too

1068
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:47,530
because somebody said you didn't even make it, it's fake.

1069
02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:52,110
Lost the chicken.

1070
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:54,229
This music's driving me insane.

1071
02:21:54,229 --> 02:21:56,590
Hold on.

1072
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:58,190
It's the radio, where's the radio?

1073
02:21:58,190 --> 02:22:02,549
Turn off the radio.

1074
02:22:02,549 --> 02:22:04,110
Yeah, when I move around really fast,

1075
02:22:04,110 --> 02:22:04,950
it's like.

1076
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:17,489
Where is it?

1077
02:22:17,489 --> 02:22:19,530
I'm playing empty folder.

1078
02:22:19,569 --> 02:22:21,500
Empty playlist.

1079
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:26,149
Oh, turn it off.

1080
02:22:26,149 --> 02:22:27,229
What was I doing?

1081
02:22:27,229 --> 02:22:28,590
Oh, just stop this.

1082
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:30,149
I don't know, clean it up, clean it up.

1083
02:22:30,149 --> 02:22:32,309
Clean, clean, I need to clean this up.

1084
02:22:32,309 --> 02:22:34,110
Clean this up, clean this shit up.

1085
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:39,520
No more joking around, I have to, I need to unlock things.

1086
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:55,239
Clean up this mess.

1087
02:22:55,239 --> 02:22:59,840
Clean it.

1088
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,709
Why can't I?

1089
02:23:01,709 --> 02:23:14,920
I can't put, I have to have to do it piece by piece.

1090
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:16,879
Didn't I say that I wasn't gonna break

1091
02:23:16,879 --> 02:23:21,399
any more plates anymore?

1092
02:23:21,399 --> 02:23:26,389
Why are there five broken plates on the ground?

1093
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:30,540
Why are there that many broken plates?

1094
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:34,319
It's like I said, I don't wanna do anything like that,

1095
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:38,860
but that actually means I'm gonna do it 10 times more.

1096
02:23:38,860 --> 02:23:40,059
I really mean it this time.

1097
02:23:40,059 --> 02:23:43,379
I'm not breaking a single plate tomorrow.

1098
02:23:43,379 --> 02:23:46,280
Not one plate is breaking tomorrow.

1099
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:49,760
If a plate, don't do that.

1100
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,739
Don't say that.

1101
02:23:51,739 --> 02:23:53,709
Don't do that.

1102
02:23:53,709 --> 02:24:06,819
Just don't break one.

1103
02:24:06,819 --> 02:24:08,319
No betting.

1104
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:10,799
Don't have to put any wagers on this.

1105
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:16,950
Why, I don't, that's not necessary.

1106
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:20,120
I do have to pee though.

1107
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:33,190
That's something that we can all agree on.

1108
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:34,149
No deal.

1109
02:24:34,149 --> 02:24:38,969
No deal that I have to pee.

1110
02:24:38,969 --> 02:24:40,049
You guys, can I go pee?

1111
02:24:40,049 --> 02:24:41,899
No deal.

1112
02:24:41,899 --> 02:24:48,620
Oh, well I just, no deal.

1113
02:24:48,620 --> 02:24:49,700
All right, if you let me go pee,

1114
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:59,219
you can add a million dollars to the debt.

1115
02:24:59,219 --> 02:25:00,219
No deal.

1116
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:16,840
No deal, no deal, no deal.

1117
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:24,940
All right, we're almost at least somewhat clean.

1118
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:37,040
Can you even use this?

1119
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,709
Well, I mean, I'm going pee.

1120
02:25:39,709 --> 02:25:41,799
You're not gonna stop me.

1121
02:25:41,799 --> 02:25:43,440
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1122
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:44,440
If I have to go to the bathroom,

1123
02:25:44,440 --> 02:25:45,280
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1124
02:25:57,340 --> 02:26:01,059
I have to buy more wood.

1125
02:26:01,059 --> 02:26:06,760
Wait, I can't, I'm not allowed to turn the oven on

1126
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:10,780
if the store is closed.

1127
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:11,860
You have two trash cans.

1128
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:17,219
Yeah, I can't put trash in here, watch.

1129
02:26:17,219 --> 02:26:23,129
No, I don't wanna roll that.

1130
02:26:23,129 --> 02:26:24,569
Okay, well, it wouldn't let me do it before.

1131
02:26:24,569 --> 02:26:36,459
I don't know why.

1132
02:26:36,459 --> 02:26:37,299
How much dough do I have?

1133
02:26:37,299 --> 02:26:41,930
Not a whole lot.

1134
02:26:41,930 --> 02:27:00,180
All right, this is where the tins are gonna go.

1135
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:05,420
Clean.

1136
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:12,340
A nice fresh surface.

1137
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:15,489
Okay, what else?

1138
02:27:15,489 --> 02:27:17,750
That looks all right.

1139
02:27:17,750 --> 02:27:18,829
A little dirty in here.

1140
02:27:18,829 --> 02:27:20,629
It's super dirty in here.

1141
02:27:20,629 --> 02:27:24,889
What am I talking about?

1142
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:27,459
How much olive oil is left in here?

1143
02:27:27,459 --> 02:27:28,299
A lot.

1144
02:27:28,379 --> 02:27:30,680
Keep that, that's fine.

1145
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:33,639
Still plenty of flour in here.

1146
02:27:33,639 --> 02:27:46,559
I thought that was a bug.

1147
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:51,000
Okay, there's still milk left in here, so that's fine.

1148
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,959
We'll keep it.

1149
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:54,879
And there's not enough flour in there

1150
02:27:54,879 --> 02:27:56,959
to justify holding onto it anymore.

1151
02:27:56,959 --> 02:28:01,569
All right, salt.

1152
02:28:01,569 --> 02:28:02,610
This looks better.

1153
02:28:02,610 --> 02:28:04,409
Just doesn't look like I'm messed up.

1154
02:28:04,409 --> 02:28:10,610
I need to make new dough.

1155
02:28:10,610 --> 02:28:13,090
Let's make the dough.

1156
02:28:13,090 --> 02:28:19,790
I need to do water, flour, flour, water, nothing else.

1157
02:28:24,010 --> 02:28:28,170
No, it's crashed.

1158
02:28:28,209 --> 02:28:29,969
It's crashing.

1159
02:28:29,969 --> 02:28:30,809
Go pee?

1160
02:28:30,809 --> 02:28:35,590
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1161
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:36,430
Go to the bathroom, Jerma.

1162
02:28:36,430 --> 02:28:43,129
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

1163
02:28:43,129 --> 02:28:57,209
As you wait till the thing doesn't crash.

1164
02:28:57,209 --> 02:28:59,170
Oh, now, I can't, hold on.

1165
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:02,120
The game is like hanging right now.

1166
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:05,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1167
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:12,469
No!

1168
02:29:12,469 --> 02:29:14,790
Critical pee capacity, not quite.

1169
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:24,799
It's getting there though.

1170
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:32,379
The phone crashes this game, I'll tell you.

1171
02:29:32,379 --> 02:29:40,049
Please, don't do this.

1172
02:29:40,049 --> 02:29:45,799
No!

1173
02:29:45,799 --> 02:29:47,399
Song chain's not gonna fix it now.

1174
02:29:47,399 --> 02:29:48,909
Yeah, that's right.

1175
02:29:48,909 --> 02:29:50,309
Oh, I think it is done.

1176
02:29:50,309 --> 02:29:52,000
I think it's dead.

1177
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,600
Come on.

1178
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:57,979
When did it save last?

1179
02:29:57,979 --> 02:30:02,059
I'll be back, I'll be right back.

1180
02:30:02,059 --> 02:30:05,180
Hey, look at this.

1181
02:30:05,180 --> 02:34:53,430
I'll be right back.

1182
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:54,469
Holy shit, I got back.

1183
02:34:54,469 --> 02:34:56,600
Look at this, look at that.

1184
02:34:56,600 --> 02:35:02,590
I missed it.

1185
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:04,069
No, we don't say that here.

1186
02:35:04,069 --> 02:35:05,069
Somebody correct that person

1187
02:35:05,069 --> 02:35:15,670
that said there was a J word in there.

1188
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:18,819
Isn't this awesome though?

1189
02:35:18,819 --> 02:35:19,860
No, not Jerma.

1190
02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:26,100
It's, how cool is this though?

1191
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:34,040
This is only the second time you've ever seen this.

1192
02:35:34,040 --> 02:35:36,200
I love it, I think it's fantastic.

1193
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:37,079
Sorry, there's been a seagull

1194
02:35:37,079 --> 02:35:43,959
in your left ear this whole time.

1195
02:35:44,040 --> 02:35:46,770
Holy shit.

1196
02:35:46,770 --> 02:35:58,180
That's terrifying.

1197
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:02,620
All right, one more.

1198
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,639
Rat Tsunemiku.

1199
02:36:11,090 --> 02:36:16,840
All right, one more.

1200
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:20,879
Sterling 3D printed fireman and it glows in the dark?

1201
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:24,090
Oh no, glow in the dark version coming soon.

1202
02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:26,489
That's awesome.

1203
02:36:26,489 --> 02:36:29,290
You guys are so talented, it's unbelievable.

1204
02:36:29,290 --> 02:36:35,069
All right, one more, one more, one more, one more.

1205
02:36:35,069 --> 02:36:38,329
What the hell?

1206
02:36:38,329 --> 02:36:40,739
That's awesome.

1207
02:36:40,739 --> 02:36:43,100
All right, one more.

1208
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:50,340
One more, one more, one more, one more, one more.

1209
02:36:50,340 --> 02:36:54,139
I kind of missed that hair, don't you?

1210
02:36:54,139 --> 02:36:57,040
I missed that hair.

1211
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,879
I kind of liked it, even though like from the back

1212
02:36:58,879 --> 02:37:01,159
it looked crappy, it looked terrible from the back.

1213
02:37:01,159 --> 02:37:06,590
From the front and the side, I thought it looked pretty good.

1214
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:08,479
There's the dry rub.

1215
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:10,239
All right, one more and that's it.

1216
02:37:24,389 --> 02:37:29,559
One streamer tells truths, the other lies.

1217
02:37:29,559 --> 02:37:31,200
Hey, and oh, whoops.

1218
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:33,559
And in the time it took for me to come back,

1219
02:37:33,559 --> 02:37:37,399
the game stopped crashing, would you look at that?

1220
02:37:37,399 --> 02:37:43,579
All right, let's make the dough.

1221
02:37:43,579 --> 02:37:47,340
I need to make, where is it?

1222
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:49,389
Pizza Pro.

1223
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:52,959
What, there's two different doughs now?

1224
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:55,559
Oh shit, okay.

1225
02:37:55,559 --> 02:37:58,819
I gotta make New York dough.

1226
02:37:58,819 --> 02:38:01,219
New York style dough.

1227
02:38:01,219 --> 02:38:05,639
All right, we need universal flour, 3.5 kilograms.

1228
02:38:05,639 --> 02:38:06,479
Don't put it in there.

1229
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:16,950
Something in there already, what's in there?

1230
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:20,379
A water?

1231
02:38:20,379 --> 02:38:22,620
You know the next level are gonna need New York dough.

1232
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:23,979
It's gonna happen.

1233
02:38:23,979 --> 02:38:28,629
A water, I don't have a jug anymore.

1234
02:38:28,629 --> 02:38:38,739
I can just buy one.

1235
02:38:38,739 --> 02:39:02,750
All right, 2.3 of water.

1236
02:39:02,750 --> 02:39:06,040
2.1, excuse me.

1237
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:15,920
Excuse me.

1238
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:17,239
I spilled it?

1239
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:19,340
How?

1240
02:39:19,340 --> 02:39:24,079
Oh, 2.5, don't throw it out the window, this is expensive.

1241
02:39:24,079 --> 02:39:25,040
Shit, it's okay.

1242
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:31,690
Whatever, turn this off.

1243
02:39:31,690 --> 02:39:38,840
Turn it off the water.

1244
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:41,159
2.5, whatever.

1245
02:39:41,159 --> 02:39:45,760
All right, 35 grams of salt.

1246
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:52,090
That's sugar.

1247
02:39:52,090 --> 02:39:53,430
Just make it water.

1248
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:03,420
I promise that this wasn't my tooth breaking.

1249
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:05,799
A lot of you probably just, oh my god damn it, Jeremy.

1250
02:40:05,799 --> 02:40:10,409
What are you doing, stop.

1251
02:40:11,290 --> 02:40:14,239
I have like a candy.

1252
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:17,739
Too much salt, too much water.

1253
02:40:17,739 --> 02:40:22,700
All right, I need to add a little bit more flour.

1254
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:41,180
No, no, just dump it.

1255
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:45,510
3.5.

1256
02:40:45,510 --> 02:40:48,030
Is it a Sour Patch Kid?

1257
02:40:48,030 --> 02:40:57,340
No, it's a yummy Jolly Rancher.

1258
02:40:57,340 --> 02:41:06,239
It's not a Jolly Rancher, I just wish it was.

1259
02:41:06,239 --> 02:41:09,860
It's a CBD candy, nope.

1260
02:41:09,860 --> 02:41:19,719
It's a CBD Jolly Rancher, no.

1261
02:41:19,719 --> 02:41:25,239
How can there be water and then water in here?

1262
02:41:25,239 --> 02:41:45,020
I mean, water and then water.

1263
02:41:45,020 --> 02:41:50,520
2.3, perfect.

1264
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:52,110
Get the salt.

1265
02:41:52,110 --> 02:41:53,989
Don't screw this up, please.

1266
02:41:53,989 --> 02:42:03,540
One, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75.

1267
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:08,799
Yeast, just one thing of yeast, that's fine.

1268
02:42:12,290 --> 02:42:14,680
This is 10, throw it in there.

1269
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:18,329
Olive oil with the sugar and New York dough.

1270
02:42:18,329 --> 02:42:20,770
Really?

1271
02:42:20,770 --> 02:42:21,610
I didn't know that.

1272
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:31,770
Oop, I'm not, sprint.

1273
02:42:31,770 --> 02:42:34,100
Okay, turn off sprint.

1274
02:42:34,100 --> 02:42:43,129
Turn off sprint, no more sprinting.

1275
02:42:43,129 --> 02:42:51,280
Oh my fucking God, I even spent time not, ah!

1276
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:53,959
I even spent the extra time waiting.

1277
02:42:53,959 --> 02:42:56,520
Oh, it's okay, it's extra oily.

1278
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:58,000
I'm mad.

1279
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,440
I am upset right now, I'm not happy.

1280
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:05,139
Because I just dumped it 10 minutes ago.

1281
02:43:05,139 --> 02:43:13,520
Oh, it's fine, whatever.

1282
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,079
Jerma's mad part, pizza.

1283
02:43:24,969 --> 02:43:27,200
A little.

1284
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:29,250
All right, whatever.

1285
02:43:29,250 --> 02:43:31,370
Close it up.

1286
02:43:31,370 --> 02:43:34,540
Press the button.

1287
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:55,329
Oh, I need a tray.

1288
02:43:55,329 --> 02:43:57,250
Cool.

1289
02:43:57,250 --> 02:44:03,719
All right, so this is a New York style dough tray.

1290
02:44:03,719 --> 02:44:07,139
I'm gonna put this over here.

1291
02:44:07,139 --> 02:44:10,579
That's gonna go right there.

1292
02:44:10,579 --> 02:44:13,219
Again, what's the point of having the windows open?

1293
02:44:13,219 --> 02:44:23,770
I need to make a regular, I broke the ceiling lamp.

1294
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:26,700
I was gonna cheat when I said lights out.

1295
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:30,809
Just put them in drawers?

1296
02:44:30,809 --> 02:44:32,010
Where did they all go?

1297
02:44:32,010 --> 02:44:35,379
Oh my God, what?

1298
02:44:35,379 --> 02:44:37,670
Why?

1299
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:41,909
There's only three left.

1300
02:44:41,909 --> 02:44:57,549
I keep losing dough to collateral damage.

1301
02:44:57,549 --> 02:45:00,840
Other tray, no, there was more than this.

1302
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:02,239
It was like three more.

1303
02:45:05,659 --> 02:45:09,770
What the hell?

1304
02:45:09,770 --> 02:45:17,459
Whatever, I'm gonna make more regular dough.

1305
02:45:17,459 --> 02:45:21,059
Shit.

1306
02:45:21,059 --> 02:45:24,620
Oh, it's regular, just Neapolitan style dough.

1307
02:45:24,620 --> 02:45:26,819
In it, let's go.

1308
02:45:26,819 --> 02:45:33,409
Flour, put it in.

1309
02:45:33,409 --> 02:45:36,149
Here's the fifth reminder for Alfredo sauce.

1310
02:45:36,149 --> 02:45:40,850
I got you, I got you, don't worry.

1311
02:45:40,850 --> 02:45:52,340
And water in there.

1312
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:55,309
Just order a pizza, lol.

1313
02:45:55,309 --> 02:45:57,469
I have a pizza restaurant

1314
02:45:57,469 --> 02:46:00,549
where I just order pizzas to this restaurant

1315
02:46:00,549 --> 02:46:05,299
and then put them at the window.

1316
02:46:05,299 --> 02:46:07,059
The genius business strategy.

1317
02:46:12,299 --> 02:46:25,399
2.4, don't go too much.

1318
02:46:25,399 --> 02:46:28,229
Where's the rest of the water?

1319
02:46:28,229 --> 02:46:30,030
What would I name my pizza restaurant?

1320
02:46:38,389 --> 02:46:45,620
Flatbread, with no A in bread.

1321
02:46:45,620 --> 02:46:57,840
Oh my God, I went over.

1322
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:04,829
Flatbread, no, no, no, no, no.

1323
02:47:04,829 --> 02:47:08,319
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1324
02:47:08,319 --> 02:47:11,569
No, not flatbread, flatbread,

1325
02:47:11,569 --> 02:47:16,459
but B-R-E, but flatbread.

1326
02:47:16,459 --> 02:47:17,420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1327
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:18,340
It would be neither one of those.

1328
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:24,299
It would be, uh, slap, uh,

1329
02:47:24,299 --> 02:47:32,899
flap, flap, crunchy crust, crunchy crust.

1330
02:47:32,899 --> 02:47:35,459
But it would be, instead of Ys, it would be Es.

1331
02:47:35,459 --> 02:47:40,620
So it would be crunchy, crunchy cheeses.

1332
02:47:40,620 --> 02:48:01,260
My mascot would be a big mouse.

1333
02:48:01,260 --> 02:48:05,069
Crunchy munchies.

1334
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:11,209
How about just like, crunchies?

1335
02:48:11,209 --> 02:48:18,340
All right, let's go.

1336
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:21,850
How about crunchitize me?

1337
02:48:21,850 --> 02:48:24,260
The Krusty Krotch?

1338
02:48:24,260 --> 02:48:30,920
No, I don't think I want a restaurant named that.

1339
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:33,139
Would you eat at a restaurant

1340
02:48:33,139 --> 02:48:41,459
that was called Krusty Krotch?

1341
02:48:41,459 --> 02:48:52,600
What if it was like a 4.7 on Yelp?

1342
02:48:52,600 --> 02:48:54,620
Okay, I got my dough.

1343
02:48:54,620 --> 02:48:56,260
Don't just explode into the ceiling.

1344
02:48:56,260 --> 02:48:58,200
Okay, looking good.

1345
02:48:58,200 --> 02:48:59,399
Here's my dough.

1346
02:48:59,399 --> 02:49:01,040
Don't forget the Alfredo sauce.

1347
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:04,329
I know, I will not.

1348
02:49:04,329 --> 02:49:08,329
Alfredo.

1349
02:49:08,329 --> 02:49:09,170
Pesto.

1350
02:49:09,170 --> 02:49:11,469
Shit, I gotta make pesto sauce?

1351
02:49:11,469 --> 02:49:12,829
Oh crap, okay, hold on.

1352
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:19,059
First of all, let's, hold on.

1353
02:49:19,059 --> 02:49:20,420
I gotta dump all this crap.

1354
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:21,780
I've made a bunch of shitty sauces

1355
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:25,069
that it's gonna mess me up.

1356
02:49:25,069 --> 02:49:27,350
Oh, this is butter, sugar, flour, and mozzarella.

1357
02:49:27,350 --> 02:49:29,750
This one is butter, milk, salt,

1358
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:32,190
Parmesan cheese, garlic, just get rid of this.

1359
02:49:47,569 --> 02:49:49,250
It's your sauce lab?

1360
02:49:52,209 --> 02:49:53,889
Welcome to Sauce Lab.

1361
02:49:53,889 --> 02:49:56,010
We make all kinds of different sauces.

1362
02:49:56,049 --> 02:49:58,530
My favorite sauces and your favorite sauces.

1363
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:00,450
We take three comments.

1364
02:50:00,450 --> 02:50:02,010
You say a certain type of food

1365
02:50:02,010 --> 02:50:08,809
and we make a sauce out of it.

1366
02:50:08,809 --> 02:50:11,610
And the comments are random.

1367
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:14,860
This person said peanut butter.

1368
02:50:14,860 --> 02:50:22,459
Jake1114 said peanut butter with a wicked, gross, gross face.

1369
02:50:22,459 --> 02:50:26,780
EatMyAss12 says, dude, water.

1370
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:27,819
How are we gonna make a sauce

1371
02:50:27,819 --> 02:50:29,620
with water and peanut butter, guys?

1372
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:37,639
What the heck?

1373
02:50:37,639 --> 02:50:40,840
And Anthony Jenkins6,

1374
02:50:41,159 --> 02:50:42,520
it's probably a young dude

1375
02:50:42,520 --> 02:50:44,760
because he did his full first and last name.

1376
02:50:44,760 --> 02:50:45,840
Don't do that.

1377
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:51,270
Says blood.

1378
02:50:51,270 --> 02:50:58,290
Well, whoa, I guess it's gonna be weird, man.

1379
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:06,690
Peanut butter, water, and blood.

1380
02:51:06,690 --> 02:51:12,379
You didn't say human blood.

1381
02:51:12,379 --> 02:51:20,440
Okay, ant blood.

1382
02:51:20,440 --> 02:51:26,520
Alfredo sauce, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1383
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:28,760
Well, okay, right, right, right, right.

1384
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:32,020
No, no, not ant blood.

1385
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:33,299
I want Alfredo sauce.

1386
02:51:33,299 --> 02:51:34,620
No, I was gonna make ant blood.

1387
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:35,979
Alfredo sauce, Alfredo.

1388
02:51:35,979 --> 02:51:37,219
Salt, where am I?

1389
02:51:37,219 --> 02:51:38,059
Okay, here.

1390
02:51:44,629 --> 02:51:45,840
What?

1391
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:53,020
No, not salt, what am I doing?

1392
02:51:53,020 --> 02:52:04,940
Alfredo sauce is butter, is 150.

1393
02:52:04,940 --> 02:52:11,569
Okay, garlic, 50 grams of garlic.

1394
02:52:11,569 --> 02:52:20,260
Butter sauce, five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,

1395
02:52:23,409 --> 02:52:26,489
55, 60, 65, 70, he can go to all, he can go higher.

1396
02:52:26,489 --> 02:52:28,569
75, 80, 85, 90, how can he do that?

1397
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:32,489
85, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130,

1398
02:52:32,489 --> 02:52:36,329
holy shit, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 165, 175,

1399
02:52:36,329 --> 02:52:52,299
180, 190, 200, why is that chicken in here?

1400
02:52:52,299 --> 02:52:53,459
You wanna embarrass me?

1401
02:52:54,299 --> 02:52:57,370
I'm gonna do that with sixes.

1402
02:52:57,370 --> 02:53:01,889
Six, 12, 18, 24, 32, that's where it's over.

1403
02:53:01,889 --> 02:53:07,899
38, six, 38, 40, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 50, 56.

1404
02:53:07,899 --> 02:53:13,260
62, 68, 70, 74, 780, 86, it's over.

1405
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:28,420
All right, let's do it with sevens.

1406
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:33,420
Seven, 14, 21, 28, I don't know, it's over.

1407
02:53:34,459 --> 02:53:38,530
31, I don't know, how about eights?

1408
02:53:38,569 --> 02:53:43,569
Eight, 16, 24, 32, 30, 40, 48, that's over.

1409
02:53:49,329 --> 02:53:55,659
Nine, nine, 18, it's over.

1410
02:53:55,659 --> 02:53:56,500
How about four?

1411
02:53:56,500 --> 02:54:04,840
Four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 30, it's over.

1412
02:54:04,840 --> 02:54:08,079
Three, three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,

1413
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:11,479
33, 30, it's over, 36, it's over.

1414
02:54:11,479 --> 02:54:17,899
Why is it always in thirties?

1415
02:54:17,899 --> 02:54:22,530
I can't figure, why is that, why?

1416
02:54:22,530 --> 02:54:23,809
What about two?

1417
02:54:23,809 --> 02:54:26,370
I can do two, two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16,

1418
02:54:26,530 --> 02:54:31,530
20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 44,

1419
02:54:33,930 --> 02:54:36,059
yeah, I can do that one.

1420
02:54:36,059 --> 02:54:37,420
Is anything higher than your IQ?

1421
02:54:37,420 --> 02:54:42,819
All right, get out of here.

1422
02:54:42,819 --> 02:54:46,819
Once you cross over the first five or six tiers of,

1423
02:54:46,819 --> 02:54:51,680
I can't do it, I wish that was a joke,

1424
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:54,000
but once you get over like 40, I don't know,

1425
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,379
I just don't do math, I'm not a math guy.

1426
02:54:57,379 --> 02:54:59,139
I can fucking sprint wicked fast, you know,

1427
02:54:59,139 --> 02:55:03,159
I've said that a lot of times, but I can.

1428
02:55:03,159 --> 02:55:06,370
When does he play the game and stop stalling?

1429
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:07,889
I mean, it's been three hours of stalling, man,

1430
02:55:07,889 --> 02:55:11,790
I'm sorry, that's just the kind of how it is here.

1431
02:55:11,790 --> 02:55:12,629
I don't know if you just got here,

1432
02:55:12,629 --> 02:55:13,989
but I've been streaming for three hours

1433
02:55:13,989 --> 02:55:20,100
and I haven't even begun.

1434
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:21,719
All right, so what do we need?

1435
02:55:21,719 --> 02:55:34,100
Milk, one liter of milk.

1436
02:55:34,100 --> 02:55:37,360
I love the pouring, don't go hard, perfect pour.

1437
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:39,569
That's a fucking perfect pour.

1438
02:55:39,569 --> 02:55:50,680
Wait, oh, it's because there's only one liter in here.

1439
02:55:50,680 --> 02:55:58,379
I need universal flour, 150, this is easy to fuck up.

1440
02:55:58,379 --> 02:56:01,280
It comes out really quick, 125,

1441
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:03,899
just only 25 more, that's it.

1442
02:56:03,899 --> 02:56:05,659
Yep, got it, okay, good.

1443
02:56:05,819 --> 02:56:09,649
How many bags of flour?

1444
02:56:09,649 --> 02:56:13,829
I keep buying new bags of flour.

1445
02:56:13,829 --> 02:56:20,239
Okay, salt, pepper is just 10, that's it.

1446
02:56:20,239 --> 02:56:31,629
Pepper is also 10.

1447
02:56:31,629 --> 02:56:36,459
And then cheese, 500 grams of pie, it's just one cube.

1448
02:56:36,459 --> 02:56:38,100
Cocaine is bad for you, yes it is.

1449
02:56:38,100 --> 02:56:40,219
I've never done it before and I would say

1450
02:56:40,219 --> 02:56:41,579
to never do it, ever.

1451
02:56:41,579 --> 02:56:43,040
It's bad for you, don't do it.

1452
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:48,709
I agree, I completely agree with you.

1453
02:56:48,709 --> 02:56:51,409
What you are witnessing is caffeine and neuroticism.

1454
02:56:51,409 --> 02:56:55,979
So, it's a little different.

1455
02:56:56,020 --> 02:57:08,500
Okay, I have those containers, right?

1456
02:57:08,500 --> 02:57:11,739
Okay, that's perfect, yeah, there it is.

1457
02:57:11,739 --> 02:57:14,799
Not eroticism.

1458
02:57:14,799 --> 02:57:22,790
All right, this Alfredo is junk, get rid of it.

1459
02:57:22,790 --> 02:57:30,569
Alfredo sauce made with milk is a disgrace to Italian, what?

1460
02:57:30,569 --> 02:57:36,780
I want the sauces, okay, I want toppings here.

1461
02:57:36,780 --> 02:57:38,819
I want sauces down the bottom, so we got, okay,

1462
02:57:38,819 --> 02:57:44,530
there's your, I'm gonna make the pesto too.

1463
02:57:44,530 --> 02:57:49,059
Okay, there's my, this looks kinda old, doesn't it?

1464
02:57:49,059 --> 02:57:51,219
When marinara sauce looks like meat sauce,

1465
02:57:51,219 --> 02:57:59,280
that's when it's probably time to get rid of it, isn't it?

1466
02:57:59,559 --> 02:58:01,850
Ah, fuck it, whatever, it's still good.

1467
02:58:01,850 --> 02:58:04,829
I need more chopped garlic.

1468
02:58:04,829 --> 02:58:09,549
Go ahead and put that in here.

1469
02:58:09,549 --> 02:58:11,149
Oh, there's chicken in here.

1470
02:58:11,149 --> 02:58:12,989
Why is there so much, why are there so many

1471
02:58:12,989 --> 02:58:18,799
uncooked potato chips in here?

1472
02:58:18,799 --> 02:58:31,739
Garlic, I don't like Alfredo sauce.

1473
02:58:31,739 --> 02:58:41,530
I like it sometimes, depends on what it is.

1474
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:43,850
Why is there still chicken in here?

1475
02:58:43,850 --> 02:58:51,270
What is it, wait, what is going on?

1476
02:58:51,270 --> 02:59:01,090
This, what the fuck?

1477
02:59:01,090 --> 02:59:04,379
How much chicken did I put in here?

1478
02:59:04,379 --> 02:59:09,399
Why is it that much chicken?

1479
02:59:09,399 --> 02:59:17,139
Was it that much?

1480
02:59:17,139 --> 02:59:19,879
All right, let's go.

1481
02:59:19,959 --> 02:59:24,459
Plenty of garlic, I gotta make pesto now too.

1482
02:59:24,459 --> 02:59:27,909
Royalty-free pasta tunes?

1483
02:59:27,909 --> 02:59:30,239
Um, I don't know.

1484
02:59:30,239 --> 02:59:34,450
I haven't had to put corn on anything.

1485
02:59:34,450 --> 02:59:37,850
Now I need, I might need a little bit more mozzarella,

1486
02:59:37,850 --> 02:59:44,780
but okay, I need pesto.

1487
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:48,290
Pesto is a bunch of olive oil, which I have.

1488
02:59:48,290 --> 02:59:54,430
That's 800.

1489
02:59:54,430 --> 02:59:58,000
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1490
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:58,840
Do I have any more?

1491
02:59:58,840 --> 03:00:01,040
No.

1492
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:25,110
Can I scrape it off the wall and pour it in here?

1493
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:27,549
Oh, 7.99, that's horseshit.

1494
03:00:28,430 --> 03:00:31,510
Oh, it hurts.

1495
03:00:31,510 --> 03:00:33,309
It hurts to look at.

1496
03:00:33,309 --> 03:00:36,530
All right, now I need basil.

1497
03:00:36,530 --> 03:00:40,979
Okay, let me go, I gotta get my shopping cart.

1498
03:00:40,979 --> 03:00:47,069
Parmesan cheese, walnuts.

1499
03:00:47,069 --> 03:00:51,260
Okay, where's the walnut?

1500
03:00:51,260 --> 03:01:22,530
Walnuts, where the walnut down here?

1501
03:01:22,530 --> 03:01:26,559
Garlic, pepper, so okay, so where the,

1502
03:01:26,559 --> 03:01:30,850
I thought pesto was pine nuts.

1503
03:01:30,850 --> 03:01:35,329
Okay, where's the, where the walnuts?

1504
03:01:35,329 --> 03:01:43,819
It is, why does it say walnut?

1505
03:01:43,819 --> 03:01:53,430
Did I have an un-locked walnuts yet?

1506
03:01:53,430 --> 03:01:57,979
Blue can, oh shit, okay.

1507
03:01:58,020 --> 03:02:04,350
Garlic, salt, and then the basil is up there.

1508
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:06,819
No, but seriously, I really thought that,

1509
03:02:06,819 --> 03:02:10,920
I thought pesto was pine nuts, not walnuts.

1510
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:18,850
All right, let's get it in there.

1511
03:02:18,850 --> 03:02:23,270
Okay, give me the can.

1512
03:02:23,270 --> 03:02:30,459
This is only 300.

1513
03:02:30,459 --> 03:02:35,620
Green nuts are disgusting.

1514
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:38,180
Oh, please, sucks at game, so I can laugh.

1515
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:45,659
That's been happening for the last,

1516
03:02:45,659 --> 03:02:51,340
probably hour and a half.

1517
03:02:51,340 --> 03:02:53,700
And then it's a little bit of pepper and a little bit of salt.

1518
03:02:53,700 --> 03:02:55,659
Only five grams of pepper.

1519
03:02:55,659 --> 03:02:57,659
Two, three, four, five.

1520
03:02:57,659 --> 03:03:04,340
Salt, here, fun.

1521
03:03:04,340 --> 03:03:07,440
Oh, that's good, now I just need fresh basil.

1522
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:10,840
240 grams of fresh basil.

1523
03:03:10,840 --> 03:03:21,409
Fresh basil, hey, don't break.

1524
03:03:21,409 --> 03:03:24,030
All right, more basil.

1525
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:27,420
A little bit more basil, please.

1526
03:03:27,420 --> 03:03:31,670
A little bit more basil, please.

1527
03:03:31,670 --> 03:03:34,799
A little bit more basil, please.

1528
03:03:34,799 --> 03:03:37,030
A little bit more basil, please.

1529
03:03:37,030 --> 03:03:38,030
Sing the raid song.

1530
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,350
Raid, raid, sing the raid song.

1531
03:03:39,350 --> 03:03:41,959
We got a raid, who is it?

1532
03:03:41,959 --> 03:03:45,340
Raid song, all right, raid.

1533
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:46,899
Who raided, I didn't see it, who raid?

1534
03:03:46,940 --> 03:03:51,829
Raid, raid, raid, raid, raid.

1535
03:03:51,829 --> 03:03:54,870
Raid, raid, raid, raid, we got a raid.

1536
03:03:54,870 --> 03:03:57,829
Raid, raid, raid, we got a raid.

1537
03:03:57,829 --> 03:03:59,829
We got a raid, we got a fucking raid.

1538
03:03:59,829 --> 03:04:01,430
Raid, we got a fucking raid.

1539
03:04:01,430 --> 03:04:15,379
You lied, there's nobody here.

1540
03:04:15,379 --> 03:04:26,950
Presto, Amelia Watson raid.

1541
03:04:26,950 --> 03:04:45,069
Amelia Watson, he said it, said what?

1542
03:04:45,069 --> 03:04:47,379
He said it, what are you doing?

1543
03:04:47,379 --> 03:04:54,360
What's wrong with you guys?

1544
03:04:54,360 --> 03:04:55,719
Did I get one guide again?

1545
03:04:55,719 --> 03:04:57,600
Did I get one guide again?

1546
03:04:57,600 --> 03:04:59,879
Did I read a one guy thing and I said,

1547
03:05:09,860 --> 03:05:11,770
what did I do?

1548
03:05:11,770 --> 03:05:15,020
Raid, raid from Marlon Brando?

1549
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:29,329
Oh my God.

1550
03:05:29,329 --> 03:05:35,700
If only cleaning was this easy, even with glass.

1551
03:05:35,700 --> 03:05:41,940
God damn it, Avril Lavigne raid.

1552
03:05:41,940 --> 03:05:51,290
Oh, I wanna listen to that song so bad right now,

1553
03:05:51,290 --> 03:05:53,479
don't you?

1554
03:05:53,479 --> 03:05:55,559
Oh, how bad do you wanna listen to that song?

1555
03:05:55,559 --> 03:05:57,399
How badly do you want me to turn that song

1556
03:05:57,399 --> 03:05:58,760
on and just fucking jam out to it?

1557
03:05:58,760 --> 03:06:03,750
So bad right now.

1558
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:11,799
But we're no longer allowed to enjoy music.

1559
03:06:11,799 --> 03:06:14,399
I have to pay a music executive like fucking $40

1560
03:06:14,399 --> 03:06:20,280
in a dark alleyway to listen to music anymore.

1561
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:32,409
Why is it like buying drugs now?

1562
03:06:32,409 --> 03:06:34,610
Correction, 40,000.

1563
03:06:40,450 --> 03:06:45,200
Okay, so my basil, my pesto is ready.

1564
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:50,000
I got my marinara, my Alfredo, my pesto

1565
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,239
and that shit, that's all right, I'm ready to go.

1566
03:06:52,239 --> 03:06:58,670
Maybe, maybe I need to make some more cheese.

1567
03:06:58,670 --> 03:07:11,930
Let's go get mozzarella, running out of cheese.

1568
03:07:11,930 --> 03:07:15,979
Gordon Ramsay raid, salmon, tender.

1569
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:18,180
Turn it around, crisp.

1570
03:07:18,180 --> 03:07:25,340
Off the pan, tender.

1571
03:07:25,340 --> 03:07:30,899
Why do I have so many bread pans?

1572
03:07:30,899 --> 03:07:32,500
Top this shit up.

1573
03:07:32,500 --> 03:07:35,860
I thought this was dough, I'm gonna roll it out.

1574
03:07:35,860 --> 03:07:38,219
That was bad impression, too quiet.

1575
03:07:38,219 --> 03:07:55,020
Sorry, my parents are in the other room, dude, fuck.

1576
03:07:55,020 --> 03:08:00,059
You fucking donkey.

1577
03:08:00,059 --> 03:08:03,299
That was just me saying that.

1578
03:08:03,299 --> 03:08:10,920
I wasn't even going Ramsey, that was just me doing that.

1579
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:11,760
Shrek.

1580
03:08:22,799 --> 03:08:24,559
Do a different, better voice.

1581
03:08:24,559 --> 03:08:27,120
Hey, come on, what am I?

1582
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:28,399
What is this?

1583
03:08:28,399 --> 03:08:30,799
Do a different, better voice.

1584
03:08:30,799 --> 03:08:36,329
I gotta clean my fucking castle up or whatever this place is.

1585
03:08:36,329 --> 03:08:41,270
Get this out of here, I don't even use it.

1586
03:08:41,270 --> 03:08:44,090
Why is everything silent?

1587
03:08:44,090 --> 03:08:45,290
All right, I don't even care if it's dirty.

1588
03:08:45,290 --> 03:08:46,649
Let's go, I'm leaving.

1589
03:08:46,649 --> 03:08:50,950
I'm ready for the new day, let's go.

1590
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:52,670
Remember the three voices guy?

1591
03:08:52,670 --> 03:08:55,020
No, I've got at least six.

1592
03:08:55,020 --> 03:09:02,139
Negative 320, whatever.

1593
03:09:02,139 --> 03:09:03,739
New voices for us.

1594
03:09:03,739 --> 03:09:16,860
What do you want?

1595
03:09:16,860 --> 03:09:18,299
Call them, do Avril Lavigne?

1596
03:09:19,299 --> 03:09:22,739
I can't do Avril Lavigne.

1597
03:09:22,739 --> 03:09:23,700
Do Bill Clinton.

1598
03:09:25,340 --> 03:09:26,620
Let me just tell you.

1599
03:09:26,620 --> 03:09:28,899
No, no, no, no, sit down, sit down.

1600
03:09:28,899 --> 03:09:33,780
I did not have sex with that woman, I did not.

1601
03:09:33,780 --> 03:09:46,510
Okay, Michael Scott.

1602
03:09:46,510 --> 03:09:50,670
I, you know, I can't even,

1603
03:09:50,670 --> 03:09:53,709
you're all in big trouble, all of you here.

1604
03:09:53,709 --> 03:09:59,579
Okay, by the way, I've not seen one episode of The Office,

1605
03:09:59,579 --> 03:10:01,379
so I have no idea what he talks like.

1606
03:10:01,379 --> 03:10:03,100
I just was guessing based on like his face.

1607
03:10:03,100 --> 03:10:12,979
I've seen it in the Netflix trailer.

1608
03:10:12,979 --> 03:10:15,139
I'm not, I'm serious, I've not watched The Office.

1609
03:10:15,139 --> 03:10:24,979
I've not, that was Adam Sandler.

1610
03:10:24,979 --> 03:10:27,020
I don't even, that's just like Steve Carell.

1611
03:10:27,020 --> 03:10:32,110
I don't even know, The Office sucks.

1612
03:10:32,110 --> 03:10:33,989
I didn't say that, this person did.

1613
03:10:33,989 --> 03:10:40,139
Get him.

1614
03:10:40,139 --> 03:10:50,299
No, we're not doing impression speed run again.

1615
03:10:50,299 --> 03:10:59,809
It's a, okay, hold on, there's a pizza in here already.

1616
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:12,399
They're right, I gotta get rid of this pizza.

1617
03:11:12,399 --> 03:11:14,520
Upset your stream any percent run.

1618
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:15,360
World record?

1619
03:11:18,340 --> 03:11:20,700
No, I don't wanna cause like a bunch of problems.

1620
03:11:20,700 --> 03:11:31,280
I'm like playing my pizza game.

1621
03:11:31,280 --> 03:11:33,559
Do Goku.

1622
03:11:33,559 --> 03:11:36,319
No, no, all right, I'm playing.

1623
03:11:36,319 --> 03:11:37,719
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1624
03:11:37,719 --> 03:11:38,719
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1625
03:11:38,719 --> 03:11:40,040
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1626
03:11:40,040 --> 03:11:41,399
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1627
03:11:41,399 --> 03:11:42,639
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1628
03:11:42,639 --> 03:11:45,280
I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing, I'm playing,

1629
03:11:45,280 --> 03:11:46,120
I'm playing.

1630
03:11:48,159 --> 03:11:49,520
Do Larry David.

1631
03:11:49,520 --> 03:12:13,739
No, let me ask you something, let me ask you something.

1632
03:12:13,739 --> 03:12:17,590
When you do, everything's just a version of Adam Sandler.

1633
03:12:17,590 --> 03:12:19,430
That's, I've noticed that.

1634
03:12:19,430 --> 03:12:20,270
It's just.

1635
03:12:20,270 --> 03:12:22,350
No, don't you want to die?

1636
03:12:22,350 --> 03:12:24,430
Oh, I don't want you to die.

1637
03:12:27,139 --> 03:12:30,659
I don't need, I don't need, I don't need Goku.

1638
03:12:30,659 --> 03:12:34,399
All right.

1639
03:12:34,399 --> 03:12:36,360
If the person that you like,

1640
03:12:36,360 --> 03:12:38,600
if somebody that you think is cool,

1641
03:12:38,600 --> 03:12:39,440
like a TV actor or something,

1642
03:12:39,440 --> 03:12:42,399
and they make a loud noise with the back of their throat,

1643
03:12:42,399 --> 03:12:47,860
I'm all for it.

1644
03:12:47,860 --> 03:12:51,899
All right, let's get a pizza.

1645
03:12:51,899 --> 03:12:53,750
You said Goku?

1646
03:12:55,739 --> 03:12:59,239
All right, pesto pizza, let's go.

1647
03:12:59,239 --> 03:13:04,979
No, it's not.

1648
03:13:04,979 --> 03:13:06,500
Okay, Margarita in New York, the game crashed.

1649
03:13:06,500 --> 03:13:11,290
Margarita in New York style.

1650
03:13:11,290 --> 03:13:12,129
Ooh, Yoda.

1651
03:13:12,129 --> 03:13:12,969
No, no, all right.

1652
03:13:12,969 --> 03:13:14,489
There was one person in the chat that just said,

1653
03:13:14,489 --> 03:13:16,209
shut the fuck up and play the game.

1654
03:13:16,209 --> 03:13:17,370
And I'm going to listen to that one.

1655
03:13:17,370 --> 03:13:28,420
That's a one guy moment.

1656
03:13:28,420 --> 03:13:29,260
All right, fine.

1657
03:13:29,260 --> 03:13:32,799
A final Garfield impression.

1658
03:13:32,799 --> 03:13:34,559
No, I was just going to go,

1659
03:13:34,559 --> 03:13:35,879
Yoda, no, no.

1660
03:13:43,670 --> 03:13:46,209
That guy was rude.

1661
03:13:46,209 --> 03:13:51,809
Rude, but he might have a point.

1662
03:13:51,809 --> 03:13:53,569
Which by the way, nobody gets to win on my channel

1663
03:13:53,569 --> 03:14:10,340
unless it's me, ban that person.

1664
03:14:10,340 --> 03:14:11,340
He's right though.

1665
03:14:11,340 --> 03:14:12,739
I am not stalling right now.

1666
03:14:12,739 --> 03:14:13,659
The game is hanging.

1667
03:14:13,659 --> 03:14:19,709
I'm waiting for it to come back.

1668
03:14:19,709 --> 03:14:21,940
Think he in the brain?

1669
03:14:21,940 --> 03:14:24,829
Same thing we're going to do every day, Pinty.

1670
03:14:24,829 --> 03:14:27,600
Try to take over the world.

1671
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:29,280
Ah, ah, oh, Zoinks.

1672
03:14:29,280 --> 03:14:30,479
I don't know what he's, I forget.

1673
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:31,680
I actually forget what he sounds like.

1674
03:14:31,680 --> 03:14:34,180
I know it's something like that.

1675
03:14:34,180 --> 03:14:39,610
Oh, it's something, I don't know.

1676
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:41,569
It's Narf, whatever, not Zoinks.

1677
03:14:41,569 --> 03:14:58,180
It's Shaggy.

1678
03:14:58,180 --> 03:15:00,180
No, no, don't, you clipped it

1679
03:15:00,180 --> 03:15:01,500
and it's going to be embarrassing

1680
03:15:01,500 --> 03:15:03,139
for the rest of my life, whatever.

1681
03:15:05,079 --> 03:15:21,579
Why is it still hanging?

1682
03:15:21,579 --> 03:15:22,899
Do something funny.

1683
03:15:26,139 --> 03:15:29,209
Hold on, let me,

1684
03:15:29,209 --> 03:15:31,739
why is the game with the crash?

1685
03:15:31,739 --> 03:15:33,180
Do something fucking funny.

1686
03:15:33,180 --> 03:15:35,340
Hurry up, do something funny, dude.

1687
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:40,930
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1688
03:15:40,930 --> 03:15:42,010
Uh-uh.

1689
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:51,709
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

1690
03:15:51,709 --> 03:15:52,549
Plus two.

1691
03:15:52,549 --> 03:15:57,010
No, you can't, it can't be that easy.

1692
03:15:57,010 --> 03:16:01,659
All right, seriously, why is it still hanging?

1693
03:16:01,659 --> 03:16:02,500
Shut up and play.

1694
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:04,059
I'm trying to play the game right now.

1695
03:16:04,059 --> 03:16:04,979
All right, I promise.

1696
03:16:04,979 --> 03:16:07,500
All right, I'm going to add debt if I don't play.

1697
03:16:07,500 --> 03:16:11,239
If I do not make a full five-star pizza

1698
03:16:11,239 --> 03:16:14,120
by stream hours of three hours and 20,

1699
03:16:14,120 --> 03:16:14,959
wait, hold on, this has to,

1700
03:16:14,959 --> 03:16:17,840
this can't hang anymore, hold on.

1701
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:20,250
If there is not a five-star pizza

1702
03:16:20,250 --> 03:16:25,420
by three hours and 30 seconds, 30 minutes of this stream

1703
03:16:25,420 --> 03:16:30,659
and I will owe six dollars to the debt.

1704
03:16:30,940 --> 03:16:31,780
But I would love to wait.

1705
03:16:31,780 --> 03:16:32,940
The game right now is crashed

1706
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:42,659
and I'm waiting for it to respond.

1707
03:16:42,659 --> 03:16:51,010
That's a deal, okay?

1708
03:16:51,010 --> 03:16:57,969
Do the pizza tier list.

1709
03:16:57,969 --> 03:16:59,129
I might have to close the program

1710
03:16:59,129 --> 03:17:02,780
because I need to get on this now.

1711
03:17:02,780 --> 03:17:06,479
It took like a minute before it came back last time.

1712
03:17:06,479 --> 03:17:07,600
No, not six billion.

1713
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:19,549
I said six, I don't know, six million.

1714
03:17:19,549 --> 03:17:22,500
And why is it opening the phone in this game?

1715
03:17:22,500 --> 03:17:27,790
Crash it.

1716
03:17:27,790 --> 03:17:35,670
All right, I'm giving it 10 seconds before I restart it.

1717
03:17:35,670 --> 03:17:37,469
It's the screen time.

1718
03:17:37,469 --> 03:17:38,709
All right, 10 seconds and I'm gone

1719
03:17:38,709 --> 03:17:42,719
and I'm going to restart it.

1720
03:17:42,719 --> 03:17:43,559
You don't have a TI?

1721
03:17:43,559 --> 03:17:49,819
No, I don't have a TI.

1722
03:17:49,819 --> 03:17:52,170
Here it comes, five seconds.

1723
03:17:52,170 --> 03:17:56,139
Come on, please, come on, do it.

1724
03:18:00,129 --> 03:18:06,750
All right, I'm restarted, close it.

1725
03:18:06,750 --> 03:18:15,459
I'm restarting it.

1726
03:18:15,459 --> 03:18:18,899
Come on, I can't even get out of the game.

1727
03:18:18,899 --> 03:18:20,299
What the hell?

1728
03:18:20,299 --> 03:18:22,940
Oh, okay, it took a while.

1729
03:18:22,940 --> 03:18:24,100
Pizza tier list.

1730
03:18:26,549 --> 03:18:30,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1731
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:35,770
I like want to play this.

1732
03:18:35,770 --> 03:18:37,610
We'll do pizza tier list next time.

1733
03:18:37,610 --> 03:18:39,709
Otto, what's the matter?

1734
03:18:39,709 --> 03:18:40,709
You need something?

1735
03:18:40,709 --> 03:18:43,030
What do you need?

1736
03:18:43,030 --> 03:18:44,639
You need something?

1737
03:18:44,639 --> 03:18:47,959
What do you need, Otto?

1738
03:18:47,959 --> 03:18:49,590
What is it?

1739
03:18:49,590 --> 03:18:50,430
What is it?

1740
03:18:50,430 --> 03:18:51,430
What is it?

1741
03:18:51,430 --> 03:18:53,110
What is it, Mr. Otto?

1742
03:18:53,110 --> 03:18:53,950
What is it?

1743
03:18:53,950 --> 03:18:56,700
What is it?

1744
03:18:57,459 --> 03:18:59,459
Let me, he needs something, hold on.

1745
03:18:59,459 --> 03:19:02,139
You need something?

1746
03:19:02,139 --> 03:19:02,979
He doesn't need something.

1747
03:19:02,979 --> 03:19:04,219
Let me see what he wants.

1748
03:19:04,219 --> 03:19:06,219
I'll be right back.

1749
03:19:06,219 --> 03:21:05,870
Hey, you get the VRB screen again.

1750
03:21:05,870 --> 03:21:07,510
This music does not really,

1751
03:21:07,510 --> 03:21:10,909
this music doesn't really fit with the artwork, does it?

1752
03:21:14,040 --> 03:21:16,399
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

1753
03:21:16,399 --> 03:21:17,239
It kind of does.

1754
03:21:23,260 --> 03:21:32,420
Face, I hate that face so much, more than anything.

1755
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:35,700
Late night's, last night's chat logs.

1756
03:21:36,540 --> 03:21:38,819
Oh, but where's Otto?

1757
03:21:41,059 --> 03:21:43,020
How come Cheeto is in Otto's bed?

1758
03:21:49,739 --> 03:21:53,299
Love it.

1759
03:21:53,299 --> 03:21:54,379
What about Cat-Germa?

1760
03:21:54,379 --> 03:21:55,459
Cat-Boy-Germa?

1761
03:21:55,459 --> 03:21:59,670
What?

1762
03:21:59,670 --> 03:22:09,739
What about Cat-Boy?

1763
03:22:09,739 --> 03:22:16,819
He doesn't know.

1764
03:22:16,819 --> 03:22:21,579
Is the Nightwing shirt, I still have that.

1765
03:22:21,579 --> 03:22:29,329
Giant rat that hides all the rocks.

1766
03:22:29,329 --> 03:22:30,409
Did that show up?

1767
03:22:46,750 --> 03:22:48,149
Cat-Boy.

1768
03:22:48,149 --> 03:22:49,829
All right, I love this thing so much.

1769
03:22:49,829 --> 03:22:51,549
I just consider it all day.

1770
03:22:51,549 --> 03:22:52,989
What, is that a real gorilla?

1771
03:22:52,989 --> 03:22:54,940
No.

1772
03:22:54,940 --> 03:22:56,260
Look at the little shit post.

1773
03:22:56,260 --> 03:22:57,100
LMAO.

1774
03:23:02,659 --> 03:23:07,750
All right, let's get back into pizza.

1775
03:23:07,750 --> 03:23:09,629
Kind of like a cookie, kind of like a pizza.

1776
03:23:09,629 --> 03:23:13,659
I like to call it a cookie-tza.

1777
03:23:13,659 --> 03:23:25,639
Kathy, are you gonna feed me or what?

1778
03:23:25,639 --> 03:23:28,479
Oh, I forgot, nobody watches every infomercial

1779
03:23:28,479 --> 03:23:30,280
from like 20 years ago.

1780
03:23:30,280 --> 03:23:37,319
Sorry.

1781
03:23:37,319 --> 03:23:46,659
All right, let's make a pizza.

1782
03:23:46,659 --> 03:23:50,319
Okay, this one is just meat.

1783
03:23:50,319 --> 03:23:52,260
Don't crash.

1784
03:23:52,260 --> 03:23:54,420
Okay, small pizza.

1785
03:23:54,420 --> 03:23:56,940
You want buffalo mozzarella and Italian sausage.

1786
03:23:56,979 --> 03:23:58,459
Okay, I can do that.

1787
03:23:58,459 --> 03:24:00,440
Small New York dough.

1788
03:24:00,440 --> 03:24:04,290
This is New York dough right here.

1789
03:24:04,290 --> 03:24:05,809
There's a small right there.

1790
03:24:05,809 --> 03:24:07,250
Give me the small, please.

1791
03:24:07,250 --> 03:24:08,370
Small.

1792
03:24:08,370 --> 03:24:10,500
New York.

1793
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:14,000
That's my tray.

1794
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:15,319
Let me, first of all, hold on.

1795
03:24:15,319 --> 03:24:25,110
This is gonna get in the way.

1796
03:24:25,110 --> 03:24:26,510
It's actually gonna get in the way.

1797
03:24:26,510 --> 03:24:35,750
Okay, marinara.

1798
03:24:35,750 --> 03:24:37,340
Nice.

1799
03:24:37,340 --> 03:24:39,340
It kind of looks like one of those jelly cookies.

1800
03:24:39,340 --> 03:24:40,180
I love those things.

1801
03:24:40,180 --> 03:24:41,459
Okay, buffalo mozzarella.

1802
03:24:41,459 --> 03:24:55,969
I don't have, do I have buffalo mozzarella?

1803
03:24:55,969 --> 03:25:03,420
I gotta cut it up.

1804
03:25:03,420 --> 03:25:04,260
I need a tray.

1805
03:25:04,260 --> 03:25:07,860
I have so many trays.

1806
03:25:07,860 --> 03:25:08,700
Where are they?

1807
03:25:13,319 --> 03:25:14,159
Oh, that chops up.

1808
03:25:14,159 --> 03:25:15,799
What else do I get?

1809
03:25:15,799 --> 03:25:16,639
Italian sausage.

1810
03:25:16,639 --> 03:25:19,399
Do I have Italian sausage?

1811
03:25:19,399 --> 03:25:20,399
I don't, I don't think I do.

1812
03:25:20,399 --> 03:25:24,069
All right, give me the tray.

1813
03:25:24,069 --> 03:25:25,629
I need Italian sausage.

1814
03:25:25,629 --> 03:25:26,469
Do I?

1815
03:25:26,469 --> 03:25:29,360
Wait, I have chicken and salami.

1816
03:25:29,360 --> 03:25:33,000
Fuck.

1817
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:38,190
Italian sausage, Italian sausage, Italian sausage.

1818
03:25:38,190 --> 03:25:42,040
Italian sausage, let's go.

1819
03:25:42,040 --> 03:25:47,659
What up?

1820
03:25:47,659 --> 03:25:55,739
I need another container.

1821
03:25:55,739 --> 03:25:57,819
And then basil leaf is already up there.

1822
03:25:57,819 --> 03:25:58,899
Buffalo mozzarella.

1823
03:26:02,879 --> 03:26:04,280
That's not that much, but whatever.

1824
03:26:04,280 --> 03:26:06,860
I'll deal with it.

1825
03:26:06,860 --> 03:26:09,000
Okay, here we go.

1826
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:11,520
So I need buffalo mozzarella, 120 grams.

1827
03:26:11,520 --> 03:26:13,290
Let's go.

1828
03:26:13,290 --> 03:26:17,979
Buffalo mozzarella, 120.

1829
03:26:17,979 --> 03:26:20,250
Nice.

1830
03:26:20,250 --> 03:26:25,489
And Italian sausage, which is over here.

1831
03:26:25,489 --> 03:26:28,299
This is 30 grams.

1832
03:26:28,299 --> 03:26:33,299
Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

1833
03:26:34,299 --> 03:26:35,989
Okay.

1834
03:26:35,989 --> 03:26:45,180
The basil leaf, 12 grams.

1835
03:26:45,180 --> 03:26:48,299
Six, nine, 12.

1836
03:26:48,299 --> 03:26:50,559
All right.

1837
03:26:50,559 --> 03:26:56,629
And that's New York and that's small.

1838
03:26:56,629 --> 03:26:57,530
I think this is gonna be good.

1839
03:26:57,530 --> 03:27:00,059
I think this is gonna be good.

1840
03:27:00,059 --> 03:27:01,979
This is gonna be a good pizza.

1841
03:27:01,979 --> 03:27:07,280
What is already in there?

1842
03:27:07,280 --> 03:27:10,770
All right, feed this.

1843
03:27:10,770 --> 03:27:13,530
What'd I say, five, right?

1844
03:27:13,530 --> 03:27:26,010
It might be five, it might be pretty good.

1845
03:27:26,010 --> 03:27:36,989
This pizza's been in there for a full 48 hours.

1846
03:27:36,989 --> 03:27:41,680
All right, the one that I care about is the small one.

1847
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:50,079
I'm not gonna press Q, no.

1848
03:27:50,079 --> 03:27:55,579
Holy shit, I have a head.

1849
03:27:55,579 --> 03:27:58,680
Okay, almost.

1850
03:27:58,680 --> 03:28:00,319
And it's perfect.

1851
03:28:00,319 --> 03:28:05,959
Now, get it up.

1852
03:28:05,959 --> 03:28:06,799
Nice.

1853
03:28:06,799 --> 03:28:09,729
That looks good.

1854
03:28:09,729 --> 03:28:21,729
That looks pretty good.

1855
03:28:21,729 --> 03:28:23,389
This is it.

1856
03:28:23,389 --> 03:28:25,110
Okay, we've got a special.

1857
03:28:25,110 --> 03:28:28,389
Buy one, get one free.

1858
03:28:28,389 --> 03:28:29,790
Wait, we bought a small pizza

1859
03:28:29,790 --> 03:28:32,229
and you're giving us a large pizza for free?

1860
03:28:32,229 --> 03:28:35,079
Yep.

1861
03:28:35,079 --> 03:28:38,590
Okay, plate.

1862
03:28:38,590 --> 03:28:39,530
It's ugly?

1863
03:28:39,530 --> 03:28:40,370
No, it's not.

1864
03:28:40,370 --> 03:28:47,129
That's beautiful.

1865
03:28:47,129 --> 03:28:49,200
What's wrong with this?

1866
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:52,500
I would eat this right now if I could.

1867
03:28:52,500 --> 03:28:54,579
Looks crispy, it looks done, it looks yummy,

1868
03:28:54,579 --> 03:28:56,180
it looks perfect.

1869
03:28:56,180 --> 03:29:02,860
That's a five-star pizza.

1870
03:29:02,860 --> 03:29:08,690
Here you go.

1871
03:29:08,690 --> 03:29:09,649
Thank you.

1872
03:29:09,649 --> 03:29:12,479
Five-star pizza.

1873
03:29:12,479 --> 03:29:16,239
Mm-hmm.

1874
03:29:16,239 --> 03:29:17,399
What's next?

1875
03:29:17,399 --> 03:29:18,920
Well, let's do the beginning two.

1876
03:29:18,920 --> 03:29:20,370
Double it up.

1877
03:29:20,370 --> 03:29:23,049
All right, we're gonna meet, I have three now.

1878
03:29:23,049 --> 03:29:24,639
We can do three.

1879
03:29:24,639 --> 03:29:30,620
This is medium, large, medium.

1880
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:42,500
All right, so two medium pizzas, one large pizza.

1881
03:29:42,500 --> 03:29:46,079
A full pizza in the trash.

1882
03:29:46,079 --> 03:29:47,040
That's next level.

1883
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:50,110
Okay, what's the dough?

1884
03:29:50,110 --> 03:29:55,799
This is a Neapolitan, New York, large New York,

1885
03:29:55,799 --> 03:30:01,059
two medium Neapolitan, large New York,

1886
03:30:01,059 --> 03:30:12,270
two medium Neapolitan, medium, and medium.

1887
03:30:12,309 --> 03:30:17,239
Roll this up.

1888
03:30:17,239 --> 03:30:20,260
Unique New York.

1889
03:30:20,260 --> 03:30:23,950
Is that a tongue twister you want me to do?

1890
03:30:23,950 --> 03:30:30,750
Unique New York.

1891
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:31,670
Why is this small?

1892
03:30:34,520 --> 03:30:35,360
Why is it small?

1893
03:30:35,360 --> 03:30:44,260
Yeah, you saw me pick up medium.

1894
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:46,940
Medium.

1895
03:30:46,940 --> 03:30:53,399
What the fuck?

1896
03:30:53,399 --> 03:30:56,110
All right, are they all marinara?

1897
03:30:56,110 --> 03:31:00,829
Oh, this is marinara, this is marinara.

1898
03:31:00,829 --> 03:31:06,879
All marinara, let's get that one, two, three.

1899
03:31:06,879 --> 03:31:24,250
One, two, three.

1900
03:31:24,250 --> 03:31:29,299
Just tip the bag, okay, just tip the bag over.

1901
03:31:29,299 --> 03:31:30,459
Just like dump it on there.

1902
03:31:30,459 --> 03:31:40,979
Why do this with the ladle?

1903
03:31:40,979 --> 03:31:43,370
Is there not enough sauce on here?

1904
03:31:43,370 --> 03:31:44,649
Are they getting any more sauce?

1905
03:32:01,479 --> 03:32:06,020
That's all right, it's not bad.

1906
03:32:06,020 --> 03:32:09,649
All right, now they all, they all have cheese.

1907
03:32:09,649 --> 03:32:13,520
This is, what's with the double?

1908
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:17,930
Okay, this is no cheese on one of the mediums.

1909
03:32:17,930 --> 03:32:22,040
No cheese on one of the mediums.

1910
03:32:22,040 --> 03:32:24,719
Okay, no cheddar cheese on the big one.

1911
03:32:24,719 --> 03:32:26,219
So cheddar cheese cut.

1912
03:32:26,219 --> 03:32:27,059
I don't have any of that.

1913
03:32:27,059 --> 03:32:27,879
I need bacon too.

1914
03:32:27,879 --> 03:32:32,250
I need cheese and bacon.

1915
03:32:32,250 --> 03:32:35,750
Cheese and bacon and what about the other margarita?

1916
03:32:35,750 --> 03:32:39,020
Also, okay, there's cut mozzarella and basil leaf.

1917
03:32:39,020 --> 03:32:45,799
Okay, cut mozzarella, basil leaf, I can do that right now.

1918
03:32:45,799 --> 03:32:52,719
Was it 120?

1919
03:32:52,719 --> 03:32:57,219
It was 120, right?

1920
03:32:57,219 --> 03:33:07,620
Okay, and then basil, 420, right.

1921
03:33:07,620 --> 03:33:23,409
It was 100, fuck, 124.

1922
03:33:23,409 --> 03:33:27,799
That's fine, whatever, a little bit extra cheese, it's okay.

1923
03:33:27,799 --> 03:33:33,770
This other medium pizza is garlic and basil, 32, 24.

1924
03:33:35,959 --> 03:33:49,329
Cool, garlic, that's sweet corn, nevermind.

1925
03:33:49,329 --> 03:33:55,860
32, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1926
03:33:55,860 --> 03:33:57,020
Good, that one's done.

1927
03:33:57,020 --> 03:34:04,440
Now I need bacon, bacon and cheddar.

1928
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:11,379
I need cut bacon.

1929
03:34:11,379 --> 03:34:13,319
Where's the bacon?

1930
03:34:13,319 --> 03:34:14,760
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

1931
03:34:14,760 --> 03:34:16,840
Cut bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

1932
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:20,180
Well, here's cheddar and there's bacon.

1933
03:34:20,180 --> 03:34:34,670
All right, well, cut bacon.

1934
03:34:34,670 --> 03:34:36,329
I need another thing.

1935
03:34:36,329 --> 03:34:47,770
Can I just mix them together?

1936
03:34:47,770 --> 03:34:48,590
All right, where's that cheese?

1937
03:34:48,590 --> 03:35:00,549
I threw it up here.

1938
03:35:00,549 --> 03:35:10,360
It looks like good bacon on the floor.

1939
03:35:10,360 --> 03:35:17,200
I don't see it anywhere.

1940
03:35:17,200 --> 03:35:21,600
Oh, there it is.

1941
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:24,440
They wanted it chopped up, right?

1942
03:35:24,440 --> 03:35:34,280
Chopped cheddar cheese.

1943
03:35:34,280 --> 03:35:40,479
Make a little Caesar's pizza, just get some cardboard.

1944
03:35:40,479 --> 03:35:41,879
I love this kind of cheese.

1945
03:35:41,879 --> 03:35:43,200
I love when it's sliced.

1946
03:35:43,200 --> 03:35:45,600
I love the just cheddar slices.

1947
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:47,239
It's my favorite.

1948
03:35:47,239 --> 03:35:49,200
All right, let's make this.

1949
03:35:49,200 --> 03:35:54,889
So this one is 120 of cheddar, 96 of bacon.

1950
03:36:08,549 --> 03:36:12,129
We're putting like Kraft Singles on here.

1951
03:36:12,129 --> 03:36:16,399
This is kind of weird, right?

1952
03:36:16,399 --> 03:36:31,930
Okay, bacon, 96.

1953
03:36:31,930 --> 03:36:38,530
This is just a Plinko machine.

1954
03:36:38,530 --> 03:36:42,479
96?

1955
03:36:42,479 --> 03:36:45,959
This is a very ugly pizza.

1956
03:36:45,959 --> 03:36:50,110
Okay, and then basil, right?

1957
03:36:50,110 --> 03:36:52,430
Basil leaf, 36 and that's it.

1958
03:36:52,430 --> 03:37:04,360
And then we're gonna start to just cook them.

1959
03:37:04,360 --> 03:37:13,260
Or it's a match three iPad game.

1960
03:37:16,040 --> 03:37:17,729
All right, let's get it in there.

1961
03:37:17,729 --> 03:37:27,489
Nice and hot, burning hot oven.

1962
03:37:27,489 --> 03:37:37,659
Ban the customer who ordered that.

1963
03:37:37,659 --> 03:37:42,239
Okay, cool, let's load it up.

1964
03:37:42,239 --> 03:37:43,079
I'm a shirtless.

1965
03:37:43,079 --> 03:37:44,280
Yeah, there's like two or three pictures of me

1966
03:37:44,280 --> 03:37:48,239
with no clothes on on the internet.

1967
03:37:48,239 --> 03:37:51,399
Okay, I'm making that sound like it's way more in

1968
03:37:51,399 --> 03:37:52,319
than what, you know what I mean?

1969
03:37:52,319 --> 03:37:53,799
Like, oh yeah, of course there's pictures of me.

1970
03:37:53,799 --> 03:37:56,479
They're like naked on the internet, they're there.

1971
03:37:56,479 --> 03:38:01,149
No, I mean like there's like a few stills of me

1972
03:38:01,149 --> 03:38:04,040
without clothes.

1973
03:38:04,040 --> 03:38:10,719
You nudes leaked.

1974
03:38:10,719 --> 03:38:12,719
Make a peanut butter and fluff pizza.

1975
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:29,250
That sounds kind of good actually.

1976
03:38:29,250 --> 03:38:36,309
Okay, in three, two, one, they're done.

1977
03:38:36,309 --> 03:38:37,149
Get them out, get them out, get them out, get them out,

1978
03:38:37,149 --> 03:38:37,989
get them out, get them out, get them out,

1979
03:38:37,989 --> 03:38:39,709
out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

1980
03:38:39,709 --> 03:38:46,129
Don't, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it,

1981
03:38:46,129 --> 03:38:48,840
get it, get it, get it, get it.

1982
03:38:48,840 --> 03:39:05,879
This doesn't even look like it's cooked.

1983
03:39:05,879 --> 03:39:08,780
There is nothing to cook.

1984
03:39:08,780 --> 03:39:11,399
Yeah, I don't, I know that getting a pizza

1985
03:39:11,399 --> 03:39:13,319
without cheese on it, people do.

1986
03:39:13,319 --> 03:39:15,159
You know, you just get the sauce and the,

1987
03:39:15,159 --> 03:39:17,319
it's a little burnt, but whatever.

1988
03:39:17,319 --> 03:39:29,120
I don't, I'm not into that.

1989
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:32,340
And almost done.

1990
03:39:32,340 --> 03:39:33,840
At link, please.

1991
03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:34,680
Hold on.

1992
03:39:45,530 --> 03:39:47,170
What, you made me like five times smaller?

1993
03:39:47,170 --> 03:39:48,010
Is that the thing?

1994
03:39:48,010 --> 03:39:50,350
I don't get it, is that the joke?

1995
03:39:50,350 --> 03:39:56,030
I'm just like, I'm 50% smaller than I was.

1996
03:39:56,030 --> 03:39:57,030
Well, I don't get it.

1997
03:40:13,840 --> 03:40:17,159
I look like, I look like dopey.

1998
03:40:17,159 --> 03:40:21,649
Did you mess with this image?

1999
03:40:21,649 --> 03:40:41,979
You did, you did.

2000
03:40:41,979 --> 03:40:47,459
You have alien eyes.

2001
03:40:47,459 --> 03:40:56,420
What, what?

2002
03:40:56,420 --> 03:41:02,209
Don't knock that over.

2003
03:41:02,209 --> 03:41:03,129
All right, these are ready to be served.

2004
03:41:03,170 --> 03:41:09,540
All right, we need two medium pans.

2005
03:41:09,540 --> 03:41:12,309
I like to call it making it great.

2006
03:41:12,309 --> 03:41:13,649
What's making it great mean?

2007
03:41:13,649 --> 03:41:15,510
Well, we here at Pizza Hut.

2008
03:41:15,510 --> 03:41:17,389
Making it great means we get it ready for the customer,

2009
03:41:17,389 --> 03:41:19,459
correct every time.

2010
03:41:19,459 --> 03:41:20,940
Don't forget the fairy dust.

2011
03:41:20,940 --> 03:41:22,579
What's fairy dust?

2012
03:41:22,579 --> 03:41:24,739
Well, it's another way for us to making it great

2013
03:41:24,739 --> 03:41:26,420
here at Pizza Hut.

2014
03:41:26,420 --> 03:41:28,459
You sprinkle the fairy dust on the pizza

2015
03:41:28,459 --> 03:41:29,780
right at the very end.

2016
03:41:29,780 --> 03:41:31,379
Sprinkle it right at the very end?

2017
03:41:31,379 --> 03:41:32,700
Yeah, it's a secret recipe.

2018
03:41:32,700 --> 03:41:34,100
It's actually just Parmesan cheese

2019
03:41:34,100 --> 03:41:35,899
and we just pretended something else.

2020
03:41:35,899 --> 03:41:38,229
Oh, cool.

2021
03:41:38,229 --> 03:41:44,989
What pizza, which one was this one, meat?

2022
03:41:45,670 --> 03:41:47,270
Oh, you waited a long time.

2023
03:41:47,270 --> 03:41:51,309
Sorry, you waited for perfection.

2024
03:41:51,309 --> 03:41:54,590
You know how many times they delayed Smash Brothers Brawl?

2025
03:41:54,590 --> 03:41:56,709
And that game was considered

2026
03:41:56,709 --> 03:42:05,549
probably one of the worst ones.

2027
03:42:05,549 --> 03:42:10,840
This is the Neapolitan pizza.

2028
03:42:10,840 --> 03:42:16,469
Boy, I need a, it is the worst one.

2029
03:42:19,159 --> 03:42:20,159
I enjoyed it though.

2030
03:42:20,159 --> 03:42:21,239
It was all right.

2031
03:42:21,239 --> 03:42:30,739
It was still fun to play.

2032
03:42:30,739 --> 03:42:33,979
Subspace Emissary blows World of Light out of the water.

2033
03:42:33,979 --> 03:42:36,379
World of Light was cool, but it was,

2034
03:42:36,379 --> 03:42:38,799
it was like too much.

2035
03:42:38,799 --> 03:42:39,879
This is the cheese one, right?

2036
03:42:39,879 --> 03:42:47,290
Nope.

2037
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:49,930
They made such a, oh, wait a minute.

2038
03:42:49,930 --> 03:42:51,920
Chili Peppers.

2039
03:42:51,920 --> 03:42:54,399
Pepperoni, I'm gonna make my favorite pizza, finally.

2040
03:42:54,399 --> 03:42:59,200
Finally, it took like fucking four hours.

2041
03:42:59,200 --> 03:43:12,239
Prove alone on pizza.

2042
03:43:12,239 --> 03:43:16,440
I mean, I guess you could say that Smash Brothers

2043
03:43:16,440 --> 03:43:19,000
is more about playing the game,

2044
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:20,879
Smash Brothers, like fighting game style

2045
03:43:20,879 --> 03:43:22,219
than doing a single player campaign.

2046
03:43:22,219 --> 03:43:24,520
And they just added a ton of shit to do.

2047
03:43:24,520 --> 03:43:35,690
So it's just kind of extra stuff, I guess.

2048
03:43:35,690 --> 03:43:38,719
But even Smash Ultimate.

2049
03:43:38,719 --> 03:43:39,559
What are they?

2050
03:43:39,559 --> 03:43:44,319
A hundred fucking characters in that game?

2051
03:43:44,319 --> 03:43:46,000
I didn't even unlock them all.

2052
03:43:50,559 --> 03:44:10,629
Fungi, Fungi, hmm, hmm.

2053
03:44:10,629 --> 03:44:11,969
I don't have mushrooms.

2054
03:44:11,969 --> 03:44:16,950
Time to get mushrooms.

2055
03:44:16,950 --> 03:44:20,040
How many mushrooms, I'm just gonna, let's chop them up.

2056
03:44:20,040 --> 03:44:22,770
Give me a basket.

2057
03:44:22,770 --> 03:44:32,879
Fungi, make a Bunger?

2058
03:44:32,879 --> 03:44:40,969
Now, I'm gonna make my favorite pizza.

2059
03:44:40,969 --> 03:44:52,219
We'll make my pizza and their pizza at the same time.

2060
03:44:52,219 --> 03:44:56,299
Let me make sure that I have everything.

2061
03:44:56,299 --> 03:45:00,309
I do.

2062
03:45:01,309 --> 03:45:05,090
That's gonna be so delicious, you have no idea.

2063
03:45:05,090 --> 03:45:06,370
You're gonna get fired?

2064
03:45:06,370 --> 03:45:08,790
Okay, you can't fire me, dad.

2065
03:45:08,790 --> 03:45:13,969
My dad owns this place, I'm not gonna get fired.

2066
03:45:13,969 --> 03:45:15,569
He's gonna walk in here and he's gonna put his hand on his

2067
03:45:15,569 --> 03:45:19,950
head and he's gonna go,

2068
03:45:19,950 --> 03:45:22,479
then he's gonna clean all this up

2069
03:45:22,479 --> 03:45:34,219
and then I'm gonna come to work tomorrow.

2070
03:45:34,219 --> 03:45:38,979
All right, what's like a good thin crust?

2071
03:45:38,979 --> 03:45:47,620
Would Neapolitan or would New York be better for thin crust?

2072
03:45:47,620 --> 03:45:48,459
New York?

2073
03:45:48,459 --> 03:45:51,290
Okay, so I'm gonna go with a large pizza

2074
03:45:51,290 --> 03:45:56,440
because I like, I order a large pizza.

2075
03:45:56,440 --> 03:46:00,020
Anytime I get a pizza, it's always a big, long, large,

2076
03:46:00,059 --> 03:46:04,170
thin pizza.

2077
03:46:04,170 --> 03:46:06,719
And how we start off my favorite pizza

2078
03:46:06,719 --> 03:46:08,659
is we're gonna start off with just,

2079
03:46:08,659 --> 03:46:11,610
this is marinara, just marinara sauce.

2080
03:46:11,610 --> 03:46:14,110
I like my marinara sauce to be very much

2081
03:46:14,110 --> 03:46:16,209
under the cheese, by the way.

2082
03:46:16,209 --> 03:46:18,649
I like the cheese to be really sort of

2083
03:46:18,649 --> 03:46:33,899
on top of the marinara sauce.

2084
03:46:33,899 --> 03:46:44,540
Oh, oh, that's just normal.

2085
03:46:44,540 --> 03:46:45,940
All right, yes, yes, yes.

2086
03:46:45,940 --> 03:46:48,260
I'm just doing my favorite pizza, okay?

2087
03:46:48,260 --> 03:46:50,239
That's just how pizza's made.

2088
03:46:55,520 --> 03:46:58,989
This is my favorite pizza, okay?

2089
03:46:58,989 --> 03:47:01,239
That eye is looking at me.

2090
03:47:01,239 --> 03:47:02,879
That eye is looking at me, did you see that?

2091
03:47:02,879 --> 03:47:04,600
That eye was staring at me.

2092
03:47:04,600 --> 03:47:06,479
I don't like this, I'm thrown away.

2093
03:47:11,459 --> 03:47:28,620
Okay, I'm gonna do it again.

2094
03:47:28,620 --> 03:47:32,059
A good layer of sauce.

2095
03:47:32,059 --> 03:47:35,629
I like the sauce to be tangy, too.

2096
03:47:35,629 --> 03:47:38,530
Some people don't like a tangy pizza sauce, I do.

2097
03:47:38,530 --> 03:47:40,790
I think it compliments the pepperoni.

2098
03:47:40,790 --> 03:47:47,149
Oh, I just told you what my pizza was.

2099
03:47:47,149 --> 03:47:49,110
Okay, so that looks good.

2100
03:47:49,110 --> 03:47:53,049
I don't actually like the thick mozzarella cut.

2101
03:47:53,049 --> 03:47:56,430
I like the shredded mozzarella.

2102
03:47:56,430 --> 03:47:58,979
I like it to be shredded all over it.

2103
03:47:58,979 --> 03:48:01,020
And none of this bullshit where you can sit,

2104
03:48:01,020 --> 03:48:04,629
no, no, I want it all over it.

2105
03:48:04,629 --> 03:48:07,649
I ran out.

2106
03:48:07,649 --> 03:48:22,469
I need more.

2107
03:48:22,469 --> 03:48:30,840
Get in the cheese grater.

2108
03:48:30,840 --> 03:48:35,500
All right, go.

2109
03:48:35,500 --> 03:48:36,819
Cat hair pizza.

2110
03:48:39,920 --> 03:48:43,520
It looks like that before it goes into the oven, all right?

2111
03:48:43,520 --> 03:48:51,799
Relax.

2112
03:48:51,799 --> 03:48:55,379
Nice and cheesy, really get a good layer.

2113
03:48:55,379 --> 03:48:56,319
Is it floating?

2114
03:49:02,760 --> 03:49:10,739
Why is it floating?

2115
03:49:10,739 --> 03:49:12,059
Okay, that looks all right.

2116
03:49:12,059 --> 03:49:15,000
I just want a nice good layer.

2117
03:49:15,000 --> 03:49:23,610
Then comes the pepperoni, which I don't even have up here.

2118
03:49:23,610 --> 03:49:26,340
Pepperoni.

2119
03:49:26,340 --> 03:49:31,000
And I like the small pepperonis, the little ones.

2120
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:34,149
Not the mini mini ones, but just not the huge ones.

2121
03:49:34,149 --> 03:49:36,149
I don't hate the huge ones,

2122
03:49:36,149 --> 03:49:47,780
but I would rather have the smaller ones.

2123
03:49:47,780 --> 03:49:50,969
This guy's wicked horny.

2124
03:49:50,969 --> 03:49:51,809
Shut up.

2125
03:49:53,540 --> 03:49:54,459
I'm not, I'm actually not.

2126
03:49:54,459 --> 03:49:56,059
Why am I making a joke like I am?

2127
03:49:56,059 --> 03:49:57,430
I'm not.

2128
03:49:57,430 --> 03:50:00,420
Shut up.

2129
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:01,739
What am I doing that for?

2130
03:50:01,739 --> 03:50:02,940
That's not, all right.

2131
03:50:06,200 --> 03:50:08,159
I'm making a pizza.

2132
03:50:08,159 --> 03:50:09,559
Then I put the pepperoni on there,

2133
03:50:09,559 --> 03:50:11,559
and then I shred the cheese up.

2134
03:50:11,559 --> 03:50:13,360
And then I like a lot more cheese than normal.

2135
03:50:13,360 --> 03:50:16,020
Maybe a little bit of extra cheese, not too much though.

2136
03:50:16,020 --> 03:50:19,149
Holy shit, this guy's wicked fucking horny.

2137
03:50:19,149 --> 03:50:20,149
I'm what?

2138
03:50:20,149 --> 03:50:24,379
What happened?

2139
03:50:24,379 --> 03:50:27,590
Okay, let's pepperoni.

2140
03:50:27,590 --> 03:50:28,590
Here it is.

2141
03:50:28,590 --> 03:50:38,440
And I like when the pepperoni is in a spiral out,

2142
03:50:38,440 --> 03:50:39,959
because then you get a piece of pepperoni

2143
03:50:39,959 --> 03:50:48,590
on almost every single bite of your pizza.

2144
03:50:48,709 --> 03:50:50,149
I ran out.

2145
03:50:50,149 --> 03:50:51,190
God damn it.

2146
03:50:51,190 --> 03:50:54,459
I'm trying to make my favorite fucking pizza.

2147
03:50:54,459 --> 03:50:55,299
Get back.

2148
03:51:11,110 --> 03:51:13,229
Why are so many things knocked over on the floor?

2149
03:51:13,229 --> 03:51:27,090
I don't know, man, because cooking is hard.

2150
03:51:27,090 --> 03:51:27,909
No, it's not.

2151
03:51:27,909 --> 03:51:28,750
Yes, it is.

2152
03:51:28,750 --> 03:51:31,370
Otherwise you wouldn't be paying people tons of money

2153
03:51:31,370 --> 03:51:47,770
at restaurants to make it for you.

2154
03:51:47,770 --> 03:51:52,860
Okay, we're not done.

2155
03:51:52,860 --> 03:51:57,209
I also like there to be just a dash,

2156
03:51:57,209 --> 03:52:01,739
just like a whack of garlic.

2157
03:52:01,739 --> 03:52:06,540
Ladies and gentlemen, this is my favorite pizza.

2158
03:52:06,540 --> 03:52:07,860
Oh, it's not done yet.

2159
03:52:07,860 --> 03:52:09,120
It's not done yet.

2160
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:11,350
Stop rushing me.

2161
03:52:11,350 --> 03:52:12,870
Stop rushing me.

2162
03:52:12,870 --> 03:52:37,729
It's not done yet.

2163
03:52:37,729 --> 03:52:40,040
Is he drinking it?

2164
03:52:40,040 --> 03:52:41,540
A little just drizzle, drizzle,

2165
03:52:41,540 --> 03:52:43,459
and I can't do it in this game, but you know what I mean?

2166
03:52:43,459 --> 03:52:48,870
You go wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing, wing.

2167
03:52:48,870 --> 03:52:51,270
Okay, you know, you ever see unwrapped on Food Network?

2168
03:52:51,270 --> 03:52:53,790
You know those machines that do that to the chocolates?

2169
03:52:53,790 --> 03:52:56,229
They just go like blim, blim, blim, blim, blim, blim,

2170
03:52:56,229 --> 03:52:59,829
make like a little line up, down, up, down, up, down.

2171
03:52:59,829 --> 03:53:01,420
Olive oil.

2172
03:53:01,420 --> 03:53:02,500
Get it in there.

2173
03:53:02,500 --> 03:53:04,299
And you make sure that oven is hot, hot, hot, hot, hot,

2174
03:53:04,299 --> 03:53:06,780
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

2175
03:53:06,780 --> 03:53:09,100
500 degrees, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot oven.

2176
03:53:09,100 --> 03:53:10,860
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

2177
03:53:10,860 --> 03:53:16,200
Don't put it in there unless it's fucking smoking hot.

2178
03:53:16,200 --> 03:53:19,139
Hot, very hot.

2179
03:53:19,139 --> 03:53:22,549
Why is he talking to us like kids?

2180
03:53:22,549 --> 03:53:24,709
I just said the F word like four times.

2181
03:53:24,709 --> 03:53:26,500
What?

2182
03:53:26,500 --> 03:53:31,930
All right, nice and hot.

2183
03:53:31,930 --> 03:53:32,770
There it is.

2184
03:53:32,770 --> 03:53:37,579
Oh yes, it, magic, I was all right.

2185
03:53:37,579 --> 03:53:40,129
Get it in there, burning hot oven.

2186
03:53:40,129 --> 03:53:45,940
Yes, you let that, and you, and I'm sorry,

2187
03:53:45,940 --> 03:53:48,579
some of the people are gonna freak out about this.

2188
03:53:48,579 --> 03:53:52,780
When that bar fills to green, I ain't taking it out.

2189
03:53:52,780 --> 03:53:55,479
I'm not taking it out.

2190
03:53:55,479 --> 03:53:59,040
I'm gonna wait till it's a little bit overdone.

2191
03:53:59,040 --> 03:54:07,479
Just a hair, just enough.

2192
03:54:07,479 --> 03:54:14,760
Custom robo waiting room, it's been like eight months, dude.

2193
03:54:14,760 --> 03:54:20,520
Look, already looks good.

2194
03:54:20,520 --> 03:54:22,120
Already looks perfect.

2195
03:54:22,120 --> 03:54:27,270
All right, don't take it out, leave it in.

2196
03:54:27,270 --> 03:54:29,069
Get it out, get it out, get it.

2197
03:54:30,549 --> 03:54:32,270
Dude, take it out, take it out, take it, leave it in.

2198
03:54:32,270 --> 03:54:35,190
Don't touch it, leave it in.

2199
03:54:35,190 --> 03:54:36,569
Okay, all right, all right, all right, leave it in,

2200
03:54:36,569 --> 03:54:37,409
leave it in, leave it in, leave it in,

2201
03:54:37,409 --> 03:54:43,200
leave it in, leave it in, leave it in.

2202
03:54:43,200 --> 03:54:47,620
Hoo, it's perfect.

2203
03:54:47,620 --> 03:54:51,430
That's the best pizza I've made all night.

2204
03:54:51,430 --> 03:55:05,940
It's perfect.

2205
03:55:05,940 --> 03:55:10,219
And I don't put, no, no basil, no oregano.

2206
03:55:10,219 --> 03:55:12,579
No, no, no, no, no, you leave it alone

2207
03:55:12,579 --> 03:55:16,569
and you eat it just like that.

2208
03:55:16,569 --> 03:55:18,530
And you can tell when it's right,

2209
03:55:18,530 --> 03:55:20,829
when you go with the pizza cutter.

2210
03:55:21,510 --> 03:55:31,579
If you hear that sound, you've done it right.

2211
03:55:31,579 --> 03:55:34,139
And then when you pick it up and pull it out,

2212
03:55:34,139 --> 03:55:38,440
a little bit of the cheese is just running off the sides.

2213
03:55:38,440 --> 03:55:40,200
And you bite into it and you bite it.

2214
03:55:40,200 --> 03:55:42,620
It's a hot bite.

2215
03:55:42,620 --> 03:55:44,840
You get a little bit of that oil from the pepperoni.

2216
03:55:44,840 --> 03:55:47,239
The mozzarella flows in there, the garlic is there.

2217
03:55:47,239 --> 03:56:03,540
And you, the best part.

2218
03:56:03,540 --> 03:56:05,620
And then like after you bite into it, you go,

2219
03:56:05,620 --> 03:56:07,659
and then you spit it out.

2220
03:56:07,659 --> 03:56:09,500
You spit like the, you bite into it,

2221
03:56:10,139 --> 03:56:12,059
you let it smear out of your mouth onto the plate

2222
03:56:12,059 --> 03:56:12,899
because it's too hot.

2223
03:56:12,899 --> 03:56:17,520
And you didn't wait long enough.

2224
03:56:17,520 --> 03:56:19,079
And then you go, all right, whatever, whatever, whatever,

2225
03:56:19,079 --> 03:56:28,760
whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

2226
03:56:28,760 --> 03:56:33,479
Nice.

2227
03:56:34,959 --> 03:56:36,360
At least the pizza got out.

2228
03:56:39,079 --> 03:56:41,930
Whatever, at least the pizza got out.

2229
03:56:41,930 --> 03:56:45,229
All right, I need to make the other pizza.

2230
03:56:45,229 --> 03:56:48,219
Wait, should I make my second favorite pizza?

2231
03:56:48,219 --> 03:56:53,040
I feel like I should.

2232
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:57,530
Okay, second favorite pizza, incoming.

2233
03:56:57,530 --> 03:56:58,370
Do I have it?

2234
03:56:58,370 --> 03:57:01,440
Do I have the ingredients for it?

2235
03:57:01,440 --> 03:57:02,280
I don't.

2236
03:57:02,920 --> 03:57:06,940
I need something else.

2237
03:57:06,940 --> 03:57:15,860
Plain cheese pizza, that's good a lot of the time.

2238
03:57:15,860 --> 03:57:19,940
I could, you know, I could do one of my favorite pizzas.

2239
03:57:19,940 --> 03:57:30,350
I could do one of my favorites.

2240
03:57:30,350 --> 03:57:31,489
Yeah, sure.

2241
03:57:31,489 --> 03:57:36,809
Okay, I already have bacon, what am I doing?

2242
03:57:36,809 --> 03:57:41,530
We'll start, we'll go with the medium.

2243
03:57:41,530 --> 03:57:43,500
What about the customer?

2244
03:57:43,500 --> 03:57:44,780
He's just sitting here waiting for his pizza

2245
03:57:44,780 --> 03:57:48,159
and he hears me talking to somebody on the phone.

2246
03:57:48,159 --> 03:57:50,959
And I'm making the person on my phone my favorite pizzas

2247
03:57:50,959 --> 03:57:56,920
that they're not going to eat.

2248
03:57:56,920 --> 03:58:00,680
Hey, it was like 14 bucks for that pizza.

2249
03:58:00,719 --> 03:58:04,049
Just hold on, I'm telling somebody my favorite pizzas.

2250
03:58:04,049 --> 03:58:07,319
You'll be up soon.

2251
03:58:07,319 --> 03:58:11,670
Okay, so the next one, use the same dough, we'll do medium.

2252
03:58:11,670 --> 03:58:13,090
Now we're gonna do a small because,

2253
03:58:13,090 --> 03:58:20,219
no, I'm gonna use the dough I have, medium.

2254
03:58:20,219 --> 03:58:27,159
Coming up next is one of my other favorites.

2255
03:58:27,159 --> 03:58:31,159
And that starts, it starts with,

2256
03:58:31,159 --> 03:58:40,790
as you probably could have guessed, marinara.

2257
03:58:40,790 --> 03:58:43,690
Only this time we're gonna do something a little different.

2258
03:58:43,690 --> 03:58:48,930
This time, we're not going to put the cheese on first.

2259
03:58:49,930 --> 03:58:52,659
What we're going to do, are you ready?

2260
03:58:52,659 --> 03:58:57,020
We're gonna put the, I want grated onions, not cut onions.

2261
03:58:57,020 --> 03:59:18,340
Grated onions, not cut onions, excuse me.

2262
03:59:18,340 --> 03:59:20,159
Well, okay, you know what I mean?

2263
03:59:20,159 --> 03:59:21,760
I want them like, okay, no,

2264
03:59:21,760 --> 03:59:28,559
they're actually already like that, okay.

2265
03:59:28,559 --> 03:59:34,940
Onions, onions, onions, onions, onions, onions,

2266
03:59:34,940 --> 03:59:39,860
a lot of onions, onions, onions, onions, onions, onions.

2267
03:59:39,860 --> 03:59:45,190
And then after that, we do the cheese.

2268
03:59:45,190 --> 03:59:59,010
This is mozzarella and a little bit of bacon.

2269
03:59:59,049 --> 04:00:04,280
No, it's not a toenail pizza, relax.

2270
04:00:04,280 --> 04:00:06,239
Fingernails and toenails.

2271
04:00:12,709 --> 04:00:20,030
God damn it, man.

2272
04:00:20,030 --> 04:00:24,250
Just, that's just what the game looks like, okay?

2273
04:00:24,250 --> 04:00:29,739
Don't make me turn the music back on, I will.

2274
04:00:29,739 --> 04:00:49,659
I need a, I need a, oh, there's one on the ground.

2275
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:51,840
We got our onions.

2276
04:00:51,840 --> 04:00:53,319
Are you happy, how do you have the onions?

2277
04:00:53,319 --> 04:00:55,389
Are you glad you have the onions?

2278
04:00:55,389 --> 04:00:57,590
Crispy onions, they gotta be crispy.

2279
04:00:57,590 --> 04:01:01,020
Are you happy you have the onions?

2280
04:01:01,020 --> 04:01:05,170
All right, now I need the, wait, where'd it go?

2281
04:01:05,170 --> 04:01:06,700
Wait, what?

2282
04:01:06,700 --> 04:01:09,270
Wait, did I put onion in there?

2283
04:01:09,270 --> 04:01:14,649
What happened to the cheese?

2284
04:01:14,649 --> 04:01:18,250
Oh, it's not, there it is.

2285
04:01:18,250 --> 04:01:19,840
Okay, let's go.

2286
04:01:19,840 --> 04:01:22,979
So now the mozzarella and the onions

2287
04:01:22,979 --> 04:01:26,440
blend together a little bit.

2288
04:01:26,440 --> 04:01:28,000
I want little clusters too.

2289
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:30,819
Clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters,

2290
04:01:30,819 --> 04:01:36,079
extra cheese, extra cheesy, cheesy, cheesy, cheesy.

2291
04:01:36,079 --> 04:01:44,530
And then bacon.

2292
04:01:44,530 --> 04:01:46,090
Although I'm not a fan of this style,

2293
04:01:46,090 --> 04:01:53,739
I'd rather it be like cubed or like finely chopped bacon.

2294
04:01:53,739 --> 04:01:56,420
Now, if there were peppers here too,

2295
04:01:56,420 --> 04:02:00,750
I would put peppers on this too, just green peppers.

2296
04:02:00,750 --> 04:02:04,510
So you get that onions, the onions get caramelized.

2297
04:02:04,510 --> 04:02:09,129
You get the bacon, you get the, I mean, why?

2298
04:02:09,129 --> 04:02:13,090
Well, no, no, Doug, you don't need garlic on here.

2299
04:02:13,090 --> 04:02:17,639
Adley, you tell me how good this looks when it comes out.

2300
04:02:17,639 --> 04:02:19,079
Cubed bacon, yeah, it's just easier

2301
04:02:19,079 --> 04:02:34,950
because you don't, it's easier to bite into.

2302
04:02:34,950 --> 04:02:38,379
I'm gonna make a fucking fucked up pizza next.

2303
04:02:38,379 --> 04:02:42,309
I'm gonna chop up, I'm just gonna make like a turkey,

2304
04:02:42,309 --> 04:02:46,930
I'm gonna make it like a chicken.

2305
04:02:46,930 --> 04:02:54,659
Put wood on it.

2306
04:02:54,659 --> 04:02:58,170
This isn't the fucked up pizza.

2307
04:02:58,170 --> 04:02:59,010
Oh, you know what?

2308
04:02:59,010 --> 04:03:00,250
Hamburger and onion's one of my other favorites,

2309
04:03:00,250 --> 04:03:01,430
but I don't have hamburger and onion,

2310
04:03:01,430 --> 04:03:12,079
so we're gonna do bacon and onion.

2311
04:03:12,079 --> 04:03:17,459
That's not pizza, what?

2312
04:03:17,459 --> 04:03:18,739
And again, we're not gonna take this out,

2313
04:03:18,739 --> 04:03:27,549
yet we're gonna leave it in for a few minutes.

2314
04:03:27,549 --> 04:03:32,879
Don't put hamburger on pizza, why?

2315
04:03:32,879 --> 04:03:36,319
Ground, the ground hamburger you don't like?

2316
04:03:36,319 --> 04:03:40,540
I always thought that was a, I thought people liked that.

2317
04:03:40,540 --> 04:03:42,639
There you go.

2318
04:03:42,639 --> 04:03:45,850
You see, you've got, this one doesn't look as good

2319
04:03:45,850 --> 04:03:49,239
because the game's like that.

2320
04:03:49,239 --> 04:03:54,180
What you have here is the onions are underneath the cheese.

2321
04:03:54,620 --> 04:03:58,770
You get like onion surprise.

2322
04:03:58,770 --> 04:04:05,229
It does look like little dog poops.

2323
04:04:05,229 --> 04:04:18,250
Dog poop pizza, okay.

2324
04:04:18,250 --> 04:04:19,329
Make that IRL.

2325
04:04:23,510 --> 04:04:29,409
Okay, let's make a super cheese pizza.

2326
04:04:29,409 --> 04:04:31,270
I wanna make a grilled cheese pizza.

2327
04:04:31,270 --> 04:04:32,950
Can I put two, I'm gonna put two pizzas

2328
04:04:32,950 --> 04:04:34,760
on top of each other.

2329
04:04:34,760 --> 04:04:47,530
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

2330
04:04:47,530 --> 04:04:48,989
Let us make the pizza.

2331
04:04:48,989 --> 04:05:03,549
You will in a minute.

2332
04:05:03,549 --> 04:05:10,469
I wanna make my grilled cheese pizza.

2333
04:05:10,469 --> 04:05:12,989
The grilled cheese pizza is gonna be,

2334
04:05:12,989 --> 04:05:16,979
I want just, I just want tomato sauce.

2335
04:05:17,860 --> 04:05:23,090
Right in the middle, tomato sauce, right in the middle.

2336
04:05:23,090 --> 04:05:30,229
And then we're gonna get the cheese slices.

2337
04:05:30,229 --> 04:05:35,280
I need a lot more than this.

2338
04:05:35,280 --> 04:05:43,969
In my basket.

2339
04:05:43,969 --> 04:05:57,709
Is that cheddar?

2340
04:05:57,709 --> 04:06:02,280
Making it, yeah, I'm making a grilled cheese pizza.

2341
04:06:02,280 --> 04:06:08,059
All right, slice it up.

2342
04:06:08,059 --> 04:06:11,159
What's wrong with this?

2343
04:06:11,159 --> 04:06:15,340
These bonkers, I'm making one, why is there bacon in here?

2344
04:06:15,340 --> 04:06:34,430
Get this fucking bacon out of here.

2345
04:06:34,430 --> 04:06:43,770
Grind this up, grate it.

2346
04:06:43,770 --> 04:06:50,899
No, I wanted slices for the, for like a grilled cheese.

2347
04:06:50,899 --> 04:06:51,739
By the way, people are gonna be like,

2348
04:06:51,739 --> 04:06:53,780
what do you, what the fuck is, this is like,

2349
04:06:53,780 --> 04:06:55,260
what, you think this is so weird?

2350
04:06:55,260 --> 04:06:56,979
I guarantee you there's like some weird,

2351
04:06:56,979 --> 04:06:59,700
stupid food blog channel that's like,

2352
04:06:59,700 --> 04:07:01,500
whoa, look, we got the weirdest thing ever.

2353
04:07:01,500 --> 04:07:04,020
We got a grilled cheese pizza.

2354
04:07:04,020 --> 04:07:12,909
You don't think this exists somewhere?

2355
04:07:12,909 --> 04:07:14,590
You don't think that they took like two bites of that

2356
04:07:14,590 --> 04:07:29,760
and then ate no more of it?

2357
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:32,340
Ungodly amount of cheese.

2358
04:07:38,420 --> 04:07:41,540
More cheese, more cheese needed

2359
04:07:41,540 --> 04:07:50,559
for the grilled cheese pizza.

2360
04:07:50,559 --> 04:08:01,739
Oh, that's a lot of cheese.

2361
04:08:01,739 --> 04:08:05,260
Two kilogram, how much, okay, how much is a kilogram?

2362
04:08:05,260 --> 04:08:06,979
This is a lot.

2363
04:08:06,979 --> 04:08:26,219
This is actually like an extreme amount, isn't it?

2364
04:08:26,219 --> 04:08:39,969
100 pounds of cheese pizza.

2365
04:08:39,969 --> 04:08:41,129
If you walked in here and the person

2366
04:08:41,129 --> 04:08:43,659
that you saw doing this was doing this,

2367
04:08:43,659 --> 04:08:45,860
I would think that they were serving this

2368
04:08:45,860 --> 04:08:47,739
as an appetizer plate.

2369
04:08:47,739 --> 04:08:49,780
Like you had a, you were, this is like the amount

2370
04:08:49,780 --> 04:08:52,129
of cheese that you would expect on a plate

2371
04:08:52,129 --> 04:08:59,670
if there was a wedding party out here.

2372
04:08:59,670 --> 04:09:02,350
It's just cheddar slices.

2373
04:09:03,670 --> 04:09:06,629
What a shitty wedding appetizer.

2374
04:09:06,629 --> 04:09:09,569
Oh, I wonder what they're gonna have out on the serving tray.

2375
04:09:09,569 --> 04:09:11,350
Oh, bacon wrapped scallops.

2376
04:09:12,030 --> 04:09:15,389
Dates, no, no, it's slices of cheddar cheese

2377
04:09:15,389 --> 04:09:20,370
out of the package.

2378
04:09:20,370 --> 04:09:25,420
You know, a long time ago, I really wanted,

2379
04:09:25,420 --> 04:09:27,780
and I don't know, you might think I'm insane,

2380
04:09:27,780 --> 04:09:29,979
but like I've heard people doing like fun items,

2381
04:09:29,979 --> 04:09:31,780
like oh, like fast food items or like,

2382
04:09:31,780 --> 04:09:34,139
oh, we have a bunch of McDonald's French fries or something.

2383
04:09:34,139 --> 04:09:37,739
I was like, you know what, that's kind of cool.

2384
04:09:37,739 --> 04:09:41,319
If I ever got married, I think it would be kind of fun

2385
04:09:41,319 --> 04:09:47,559
to have like, I don't know, like a McDouble station.

2386
04:09:47,559 --> 04:09:49,920
No, not like, okay, and that is sort of like it,

2387
04:09:49,920 --> 04:09:52,440
but all right, listen, just for fun,

2388
04:09:52,440 --> 04:09:54,799
like it's not the dinner, it's not the meal.

2389
04:09:54,799 --> 04:09:56,600
You could just have one if you want.

2390
04:10:01,319 --> 04:10:04,219
Just a single, no, not a double, not a McDouble, sorry.

2391
04:10:04,219 --> 04:10:09,829
Just a plain McDonald's cheeseburger in the wrapper.

2392
04:10:09,829 --> 04:10:12,149
And like there's a person walking around

2393
04:10:12,149 --> 04:10:14,530
with a waiter or a waitress that has like a stack

2394
04:10:14,530 --> 04:10:19,860
of single McDonald's cheeseburger.

2395
04:10:19,860 --> 04:10:22,020
It'd be like, I don't know, if I was at a wedding

2396
04:10:22,020 --> 04:10:24,219
and they had like single McDonald's cheeseburgers,

2397
04:10:24,500 --> 04:10:26,260
because think of how fucking hungry you are

2398
04:10:26,260 --> 04:10:28,739
before the wedding is going on.

2399
04:10:28,739 --> 04:10:30,940
You gotta wait a long ass time to eat at a wedding,

2400
04:10:30,940 --> 04:10:33,319
a long time.

2401
04:10:33,319 --> 04:10:35,719
Sometimes you're starving

2402
04:10:35,719 --> 04:10:38,500
and you gotta wait another six hours before you eat.

2403
04:10:38,500 --> 04:10:40,680
And sometimes the people that are catering the wedding

2404
04:10:40,680 --> 04:10:43,540
take even longer and it's like a bunch of delays.

2405
04:10:43,540 --> 04:10:45,360
And then finally you get your salmon

2406
04:10:45,360 --> 04:10:49,309
that comes out, right?

2407
04:10:49,309 --> 04:10:51,510
I'm sorry, but after the ceremony is over

2408
04:10:51,510 --> 04:10:55,209
by like 11, 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I'm ready to eat.

2409
04:10:55,209 --> 04:10:58,110
And I'm not ready to eat like one shrimp

2410
04:10:58,950 --> 04:11:00,069
that's on a skewer that you walk by with.

2411
04:11:00,069 --> 04:11:01,459
That's not enough.

2412
04:11:01,459 --> 04:11:03,420
If you had a single McDonald's cheeseburger

2413
04:11:03,420 --> 04:11:05,739
just walking around, I'd be like, holy shit, this is awesome.

2414
04:11:05,739 --> 04:11:07,399
But this is the best wedding I've ever been to in my life.

2415
04:11:07,399 --> 04:11:09,659
This is incredible.

2416
04:11:09,659 --> 04:11:11,000
No judgments, no bullshit.

2417
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:12,479
Just like, oh yeah, there's just single

2418
04:11:12,479 --> 04:11:14,690
McDonald's cheeseburgers.

2419
04:11:14,690 --> 04:11:16,450
Yeah, give me two of those right now.

2420
04:11:16,450 --> 04:11:20,110
I'll take two right now.

2421
04:11:20,110 --> 04:11:20,950
And then guess what?

2422
04:11:20,950 --> 04:11:21,770
I'm gonna eat the dinner later too.

2423
04:11:21,770 --> 04:11:23,069
I'm gonna eat the foals, salmon,

2424
04:11:23,069 --> 04:11:30,579
and whatever, the chicken breast.

2425
04:11:30,579 --> 04:11:40,649
You're a corporate, no I'm not, I like that idea.

2426
04:11:40,649 --> 04:11:42,110
How, that's not a shill.

2427
04:11:42,110 --> 04:11:46,680
I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.

2428
04:11:46,680 --> 04:11:47,840
What, what's so wrong?

2429
04:11:47,840 --> 04:11:50,120
Okay, sure, everybody yell at me.

2430
04:11:50,120 --> 04:11:51,760
I like McDonald's cheeseburgers.

2431
04:11:51,760 --> 04:11:52,600
I like them.

2432
04:11:52,600 --> 04:11:53,879
I like them, okay?

2433
04:11:53,879 --> 04:12:05,030
I really like them.

2434
04:12:05,030 --> 04:12:08,360
I like, and I like a lot, I like how they smell.

2435
04:12:08,360 --> 04:12:18,979
Okay, listen to me.

2436
04:12:18,979 --> 04:12:22,579
Okay, I gotta settle down.

2437
04:12:22,579 --> 04:12:23,579
I gotta settle down.

2438
04:12:25,020 --> 04:12:27,920
I'm adding more and more people to the list of,

2439
04:12:27,920 --> 04:12:30,540
is everything okay in Jeremy's world?

2440
04:12:30,540 --> 04:12:31,620
Yes, everything is fine.

2441
04:12:31,659 --> 04:12:43,069
Everything's gonna be fine.

2442
04:12:43,069 --> 04:12:43,989
Every time I talk about this,

2443
04:12:43,989 --> 04:12:46,489
I add like another group of people

2444
04:12:46,489 --> 04:12:51,899
that are like concerned about my well-being.

2445
04:12:51,899 --> 04:12:54,100
I would do the McDonald's thing, I would, for real.

2446
04:12:54,100 --> 04:13:06,219
No jokes, no fucking around.

2447
04:13:06,219 --> 04:13:08,100
Oh, okay, let me, wait a minute.

2448
04:13:08,100 --> 04:13:10,620
I want you guys to yell at me over this one too.

2449
04:13:10,620 --> 04:13:14,489
Forget about single McDonald's cheeseburgers, great idea.

2450
04:13:14,489 --> 04:13:18,139
What if it was Pizza Hut breadsticks?

2451
04:13:18,139 --> 04:13:21,299
So many of you guys talking so much crap right now,

2452
04:13:21,299 --> 04:13:24,139
you would know, no way would you be like,

2453
04:13:24,139 --> 04:13:26,420
what do you mean no, what?

2454
04:13:26,420 --> 04:13:30,770
It's worse?

2455
04:13:30,770 --> 04:13:32,690
What about the red lobster rolls?

2456
04:13:32,690 --> 04:13:39,590
What about the cheddar biscuits?

2457
04:13:39,590 --> 04:13:44,280
I just need one more layer over here.

2458
04:13:44,280 --> 04:13:51,020
Olive Garden breadsticks?

2459
04:13:51,020 --> 04:13:52,180
Yeah, I mean something like that,

2460
04:13:52,180 --> 04:13:56,010
like just like a breadsticks from one of those restaurants.

2461
04:13:56,010 --> 04:14:01,219
Is that, okay, would that be good?

2462
04:14:01,219 --> 04:14:03,059
What if the soup, salad, and breadsticks

2463
04:14:03,059 --> 04:14:09,010
was the appetizer before the meal or the cocktail hour?

2464
04:14:09,010 --> 04:14:19,479
That would be awesome.

2465
04:14:19,479 --> 04:14:23,579
Yeah, all right, well none of you invited to my wedding.

2466
04:14:23,579 --> 04:14:24,420
I'm gonna have a wicked,

2467
04:14:24,700 --> 04:14:26,260
I'm gonna have McDonald's cheeseburgers,

2468
04:14:26,260 --> 04:14:29,159
I'm gonna have soup, salads, and breadsticks.

2469
04:14:29,159 --> 04:14:32,379
I'm gonna, and by the way, we're eating dessert first.

2470
04:14:32,379 --> 04:14:34,579
We're eating dessert first at my wedding.

2471
04:14:34,579 --> 04:14:46,040
That's right, ice cream first.

2472
04:14:46,040 --> 04:14:47,920
This is the kid wedding.

2473
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:50,040
The kid, child wedding.

2474
04:14:50,040 --> 04:14:53,059
There's a Chuck E. Cheese.

2475
04:15:00,549 --> 04:15:03,670
But imagine if all you guys got invited to my wedding.

2476
04:15:03,670 --> 04:15:13,430
Imagine if I had 10,000 people on the guest list.

2477
04:15:13,430 --> 04:15:15,049
We would have to have that wedding

2478
04:15:15,850 --> 04:15:18,680
in like a toothpaste factory.

2479
04:15:18,680 --> 04:15:21,139
We'd have to stuff everybody in a bunch of like a warehouse,

2480
04:15:21,139 --> 04:15:26,399
like a stadium.

2481
04:15:26,399 --> 04:15:28,719
We would need like a thousand acres

2482
04:15:28,719 --> 04:15:31,100
of like factory warehouse space.

2483
04:15:42,200 --> 04:15:45,020
Each chair has a box of toothpaste under it.

2484
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:47,899
What?

2485
04:15:47,899 --> 04:15:52,870
Have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese.

2486
04:15:52,870 --> 04:15:55,260
Maybe you guys don't understand.

2487
04:15:55,260 --> 04:15:57,809
Wedding at Chuck E. Cheese is like

2488
04:15:57,809 --> 04:15:59,969
one of the biggest marketing ploys ever.

2489
04:15:59,969 --> 04:16:02,129
You know how much money they would give me to do that?

2490
04:16:02,129 --> 04:16:03,409
You know how much money I would get

2491
04:16:03,409 --> 04:16:08,340
to have a wedding at Chuck E. Cheese on camera?

2492
04:16:08,340 --> 04:16:10,819
That's gotta be worth tons of money

2493
04:16:10,819 --> 04:16:14,629
because I'm throwing away a huge part of my life there.

2494
04:16:14,629 --> 04:16:15,909
I'm literally disintegrating

2495
04:16:15,909 --> 04:16:18,190
one of an incredibly major important thing

2496
04:16:18,190 --> 04:16:27,360
in my entire life.

2497
04:16:27,360 --> 04:16:32,030
It would just be going away.

2498
04:16:32,030 --> 04:16:40,700
Five nights at Freddy's, Chuck E. Cheese says poggers

2499
04:16:40,700 --> 04:16:45,209
and he would officiate the wedding and he better talk.

2500
04:16:45,209 --> 04:16:54,959
I'm gonna be real, he better talk

2501
04:16:54,959 --> 04:17:19,209
and he better give us free tokens for getting married.

2502
04:17:19,209 --> 04:17:21,690
20 free tokens to the bride and groom.

2503
04:17:23,879 --> 04:17:43,780
Okay, all right, all right, let's make the grilled cheese.

2504
04:17:43,780 --> 04:17:45,260
Three basic ingredients of grilled cheese

2505
04:17:45,260 --> 04:17:48,329
and you're forgetting one of them.

2506
04:17:48,329 --> 04:17:50,209
What's the other ingredient to a grilled cheese

2507
04:17:50,209 --> 04:17:53,729
besides cheese, bread, and a tomato?

2508
04:17:53,729 --> 04:17:58,299
What's the secret ingredient?

2509
04:17:58,299 --> 04:18:05,950
Butter?

2510
04:18:05,950 --> 04:18:13,399
Yes, sorry, I didn't coat it with butter.

2511
04:18:13,399 --> 04:18:18,000
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2512
04:18:18,000 --> 04:18:19,760
Tomato on a grilled cheese is a staple.

2513
04:18:19,760 --> 04:18:21,469
What are you guys talking about?

2514
04:18:21,469 --> 04:18:25,620
What?

2515
04:18:25,620 --> 04:18:28,899
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

2516
04:18:29,180 --> 04:18:30,670
Let me back up here.

2517
04:18:30,670 --> 04:18:32,180
No, I agree with you.

2518
04:18:32,180 --> 04:18:33,920
I don't like tomato on my grilled cheeses

2519
04:18:33,920 --> 04:18:35,819
but I know that a lot of people,

2520
04:18:35,819 --> 04:18:36,899
am I gaslighting myself?

2521
04:18:36,899 --> 04:18:40,440
I know that people put tomato on grilled cheese all the time.

2522
04:18:40,440 --> 04:18:42,440
I did it because if I didn't put a tomato

2523
04:18:42,440 --> 04:18:43,639
on the grilled cheese, I thought people would be like,

2524
04:18:43,639 --> 04:18:47,329
where the fuck's the tomato?

2525
04:18:47,329 --> 04:18:49,860
That's why I put it on.

2526
04:18:49,860 --> 04:18:51,139
All right, I need butter.

2527
04:18:51,139 --> 04:18:53,420
I just need a butter sauce.

2528
04:18:53,420 --> 04:19:01,950
Butter, it's a yeast.

2529
04:19:01,950 --> 04:19:09,979
I have to buy it, right?

2530
04:19:09,979 --> 04:19:23,329
I'm actually really glad that didn't break.

2531
04:19:23,329 --> 04:19:25,489
Oh shit, there's a bunch of crap in here.

2532
04:19:25,489 --> 04:19:27,809
Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash it, trash it.

2533
04:19:44,829 --> 04:19:46,469
Crap, crap, crap, crap.

2534
04:19:46,469 --> 04:20:01,049
Dang it, darn it, dumb.

2535
04:20:01,049 --> 04:20:02,379
There we go.

2536
04:20:02,379 --> 04:20:03,219
Here you go.

2537
04:20:03,219 --> 04:20:07,139
Here's your other ingredient.

2538
04:20:07,139 --> 04:20:32,159
Here's your butter that I didn't coat the bread with.

2539
04:20:32,159 --> 04:20:37,780
Get it in there.

2540
04:20:37,780 --> 04:20:38,840
Oh shit, is this still cooking?

2541
04:20:38,840 --> 04:20:42,290
No, it's not cooking, okay.

2542
04:20:42,290 --> 04:21:06,989
All right, grilled cheese, let's go.

2543
04:21:06,989 --> 04:21:11,379
Too hot, too hot, too hot, not that hot.

2544
04:21:11,379 --> 04:21:23,510
Lighter, incinerate this.

2545
04:21:23,510 --> 04:21:24,629
No, why?

2546
04:21:24,629 --> 04:21:56,340
That took so long to place at all.

2547
04:21:56,340 --> 04:22:25,709
All right, here we go.

2548
04:22:25,709 --> 04:22:30,159
Get over there.

2549
04:22:30,159 --> 04:22:33,579
Make it talk.

2550
04:22:33,579 --> 04:22:35,139
I can't make it talk.

2551
04:22:39,079 --> 04:22:42,100
Hey, hey kids.

2552
04:22:42,940 --> 04:22:58,430
You want me to make it say hey kids?

2553
04:22:58,430 --> 04:23:03,299
It just like scoop slammed it.

2554
04:23:03,299 --> 04:23:04,139
What?

2555
04:23:04,139 --> 04:23:07,389
Why did it bounce off?

2556
04:23:07,389 --> 04:23:20,100
Oh shit, it almost went on.

2557
04:23:20,100 --> 04:23:26,059
I'm trying just to flip it over so it's a grilled cheese.

2558
04:23:26,059 --> 04:23:31,340
Wait, okay, hold on.

2559
04:23:31,340 --> 04:23:50,090
Don't go in the trash.

2560
04:23:50,090 --> 04:24:02,610
Fuck, come on.

2561
04:24:02,610 --> 04:24:08,569
Actually kind of looks kind of good.

2562
04:24:08,569 --> 04:24:10,610
That's close, hold on.

2563
04:24:10,610 --> 04:24:20,959
Scrape it a little.

2564
04:24:20,959 --> 04:24:22,239
This thing's so huge.

2565
04:24:22,239 --> 04:24:43,139
I have to do this on the floor.

2566
04:24:43,139 --> 04:24:44,139
Oh, look at that.

2567
04:24:44,139 --> 04:25:01,040
Here we go, almost done.

2568
04:25:01,040 --> 04:25:14,020
Shit, it's almost there.

2569
04:25:14,020 --> 04:25:28,600
Come on, get up.

2570
04:25:28,600 --> 04:25:29,420
Get off.

2571
04:25:34,459 --> 04:25:35,299
I don't care.

2572
04:25:36,700 --> 04:25:45,379
Don't, whatever.

2573
04:25:45,379 --> 04:25:49,090
All right, what's an actual pizza I need to do?

2574
04:25:49,090 --> 04:25:51,389
I don't know, let's find out.

2575
04:25:51,389 --> 04:25:55,649
Oh, this guy's waiting a long time for this.

2576
04:25:55,649 --> 04:25:56,690
I hate this pizza.

2577
04:25:58,010 --> 04:26:00,040
Oh, it sucks.

2578
04:26:00,040 --> 04:26:01,770
Excuse me.

2579
04:26:01,770 --> 04:26:03,489
Yeah?

2580
04:26:03,489 --> 04:26:04,549
I've been waiting like two, three hours

2581
04:26:04,549 --> 04:26:09,200
for my mushroom pizza.

2582
04:26:09,200 --> 04:26:20,440
Right on that, sir.

2583
04:26:20,440 --> 04:26:21,280
Okay, I need mushrooms.

2584
04:26:21,280 --> 04:26:25,000
I gotta get mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms.

2585
04:26:25,000 --> 04:26:25,840
Closing.

2586
04:26:27,969 --> 04:26:30,690
He just has both of his arms hanging down onto the window

2587
04:26:30,690 --> 04:26:33,170
just waiting for it to close.

2588
04:26:33,290 --> 04:26:34,489
I didn't even.

2589
04:26:34,489 --> 04:26:37,209
This is like the super rich, rich kid

2590
04:26:37,209 --> 04:26:39,620
that wanted a pizza shop.

2591
04:26:39,620 --> 04:26:41,920
And instead of just bringing the kid

2592
04:26:41,920 --> 04:26:45,719
to like Plato class where they can just mess around,

2593
04:26:45,719 --> 04:26:47,159
his parents bought him a pizza shop

2594
04:26:47,159 --> 04:26:59,059
so he could make his own fucked up pizzas.

2595
04:26:59,059 --> 04:27:00,079
Okay, button mushrooms.

2596
04:27:00,079 --> 04:27:06,530
I need more of these.

2597
04:27:06,530 --> 04:27:26,530
This is like, it's like an old Macaulay Culkin movie.

2598
04:27:26,530 --> 04:27:28,309
Wait, was Macaulay Culkin in Richie Rich?

2599
04:27:28,309 --> 04:27:29,149
Or was that a different,

2600
04:27:29,149 --> 04:27:36,069
was that a different kid?

2601
04:27:36,069 --> 04:27:36,909
There's cheddar in here.

2602
04:27:36,909 --> 04:27:46,860
There's so much cheese in here, hold on.

2603
04:27:46,860 --> 04:27:49,600
You're a dinosaur?

2604
04:27:49,639 --> 04:27:53,530
I mean, Richie Rich came out in like 1995.

2605
04:27:53,530 --> 04:27:54,569
That's not that far away.

2606
04:27:54,569 --> 04:27:58,899
That's not that long ago.

2607
04:27:58,899 --> 04:28:01,139
I think I called a dinosaur.

2608
04:28:01,139 --> 04:28:12,229
What is this?

2609
04:28:12,229 --> 04:28:14,489
That's older than I am.

2610
04:28:14,489 --> 04:28:19,110
So?

2611
04:28:19,110 --> 04:28:23,540
All right, let's make this dude's pizza.

2612
04:28:23,540 --> 04:28:30,290
So he wants a Neapolitan marinara and some cut mozzarella

2613
04:28:32,420 --> 04:28:34,639
with a small, oh, look at that.

2614
04:28:34,639 --> 04:28:46,459
Perfect size right here.

2615
04:28:46,459 --> 04:28:48,299
And there's a two week old marinara.

2616
04:28:53,950 --> 04:28:56,299
Never coming back here again.

2617
04:28:56,299 --> 04:29:06,659
Ever.

2618
04:29:06,659 --> 04:29:07,479
Was it 60?

2619
04:29:10,120 --> 04:29:15,860
Okay, then we have button mushrooms.

2620
04:29:15,860 --> 04:29:20,409
Where the heck are those?

2621
04:29:20,409 --> 04:29:27,440
He wants 30 grams.

2622
04:29:27,440 --> 04:29:28,280
Okay.

2623
04:29:28,280 --> 04:29:29,100
And then basil.

2624
04:29:29,100 --> 04:29:30,600
Why does everybody put basil on all their pizzas?

2625
04:29:30,600 --> 04:29:31,440
What?

2626
04:29:31,440 --> 04:29:32,559
Stop, basil on everything.

2627
04:29:32,559 --> 04:29:38,079
Basil, basil, basil, basil, basil, basil.

2628
04:29:38,079 --> 04:29:45,040
No, don't do that.

2629
04:29:45,040 --> 04:29:46,739
All right, that's it.

2630
04:29:46,739 --> 04:29:47,950
Sir?

2631
04:29:47,950 --> 04:29:56,260
There you go.

2632
04:29:56,260 --> 04:29:57,739
It's a garnish?

2633
04:29:57,739 --> 04:30:00,079
Learn to have taste.

2634
04:30:00,079 --> 04:30:03,040
Oh, so it's a thing I remove from my food before I eat it.

2635
04:30:03,040 --> 04:30:18,239
I call that a waste.

2636
04:30:18,239 --> 04:30:19,719
You're gonna put parsley on the side?

2637
04:30:19,719 --> 04:30:20,559
No, no, no, get it out of here.

2638
04:30:20,559 --> 04:30:21,559
I don't want that.

2639
04:30:21,559 --> 04:30:23,319
You don't eat, what am I, eat parsley?

2640
04:30:23,319 --> 04:30:52,049
What am I, a rabbit?

2641
04:30:53,680 --> 04:30:55,639
Ye, I can't even read what you said,

2642
04:30:55,639 --> 04:30:58,139
but it's like, what?

2643
04:30:58,139 --> 04:31:00,100
You, I have to.

2644
04:31:00,100 --> 04:31:01,399
I don't even care.

2645
04:31:01,399 --> 04:31:07,250
Somebody says you fuck like one.

2646
04:31:07,250 --> 04:31:08,690
Here's your pizza, sir.

2647
04:31:08,690 --> 04:31:10,290
Thank you, I'm sorry for waiting so long.

2648
04:31:10,290 --> 04:31:11,790
I had to get frustrated.

2649
04:31:11,790 --> 04:31:15,799
I had to get frustrated making a grilled cheese.

2650
04:31:15,799 --> 04:31:16,639
The thing is, I'm gonna be like,

2651
04:31:16,639 --> 04:31:19,520
sorry, sorry, sir, here you go, sir.

2652
04:31:19,520 --> 04:31:20,360
It'll never happen again.

2653
04:31:20,360 --> 04:31:21,239
I'm really sorry about that.

2654
04:31:21,239 --> 04:31:23,620
Here's your pizza, free of charge.

2655
04:31:23,620 --> 04:31:24,440
He's gonna take a bite.

2656
04:31:24,440 --> 04:31:27,440
He's gonna go, give me that.

2657
04:31:27,440 --> 04:31:31,129
Oh my God, oh my God, this is unbelievable.

2658
04:31:31,129 --> 04:31:33,649
This is the best pizza I've ever had in my whole life.

2659
04:31:33,649 --> 04:31:41,040
It was worth the wait.

2660
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:45,110
It's like a SpongeBob.

2661
04:31:45,110 --> 04:31:47,899
Oh, I, wait, hold on.

2662
04:31:47,899 --> 04:31:51,819
I can put, I can make a ketchup pizza.

2663
04:31:51,819 --> 04:31:55,659
Look at all these things.

2664
04:31:55,659 --> 04:31:56,540
Oh, here we go.

2665
04:31:56,540 --> 04:31:57,780
Time to make half the people mad

2666
04:31:57,780 --> 04:31:58,959
and half the people happy.

2667
04:31:58,959 --> 04:32:11,760
Lettuce, capers, tuna?

2668
04:32:11,760 --> 04:32:29,959
I don't know about all this.

2669
04:32:29,959 --> 04:32:31,479
I thought this was a loaf of bread for a second.

2670
04:32:31,479 --> 04:32:42,940
I was like, what is this doing over here?

2671
04:32:42,940 --> 04:32:46,040
Okay, it's not that dirty.

2672
04:32:46,040 --> 04:32:47,879
You don't even get points off for being dirty anyway,

2673
04:32:47,879 --> 04:32:57,440
so why do I even care?

2674
04:32:57,719 --> 04:33:04,740
Okay, I wanna go, let me see that stuff.

2675
04:33:04,740 --> 04:33:08,540
Spices, lick, oh my God, garlic powder, cinnamon,

2676
04:33:08,540 --> 04:33:15,240
brown mustard, oregano, paprika, ketchup.

2677
04:33:15,240 --> 04:33:19,060
Oh, gross.

2678
04:33:19,060 --> 04:33:24,459
Oh, gross.

2679
04:33:24,459 --> 04:33:26,180
Oh, gross.

2680
04:33:26,180 --> 04:33:30,459
On pizza, just on, oh, gross.

2681
04:33:30,459 --> 04:33:32,220
This really is gonna become like a kid,

2682
04:33:32,220 --> 04:33:33,700
like just a child's dream.

2683
04:33:54,549 --> 04:33:56,409
I need, what do I have for dough?

2684
04:33:56,409 --> 04:34:01,060
What do I actually have left for dough?

2685
04:34:01,060 --> 04:34:05,860
What do I have left for dough?

2686
04:34:05,860 --> 04:34:10,779
Not much.

2687
04:34:10,779 --> 04:34:13,110
Let chat make a pizza.

2688
04:34:13,110 --> 04:34:17,819
Okay, medium dough.

2689
04:34:17,819 --> 04:34:19,340
What do you want?

2690
04:34:19,340 --> 04:34:24,169
Let's make a pizza.

2691
04:34:24,169 --> 04:34:25,729
Click maps, click maps,

2692
04:34:25,729 --> 04:34:34,450
that's gonna be really, really hard.

2693
04:34:34,450 --> 04:34:43,450
Pineapple, all right.

2694
04:34:43,450 --> 04:34:45,700
What kind of cheese?

2695
04:34:45,700 --> 04:35:08,790
Mayo, I don't have mayo, I haven't unlocked it.

2696
04:35:08,790 --> 04:35:10,110
It's like a, there's a comedy prop.

2697
04:35:10,110 --> 04:35:35,970
It's not even filled with anything.

2698
04:35:35,970 --> 04:35:36,889
Why do I have this?

2699
04:35:36,889 --> 04:35:48,500
It's empty.

2700
04:35:48,500 --> 04:35:52,110
Oh, he's bored?

2701
04:35:52,110 --> 04:35:56,450
No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm just playing around.

2702
04:35:56,450 --> 04:35:58,310
I'm just playing around, hold on.

2703
04:35:58,310 --> 04:36:00,229
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,

2704
04:36:00,229 --> 04:36:09,580
I'm not bored, I'm not, I'm just playing around.

2705
04:36:09,580 --> 04:36:11,380
This is just dead air.

2706
04:36:11,380 --> 04:36:13,459
Well, I'm focused, I was focusing on dumping

2707
04:36:13,459 --> 04:36:31,650
a gasoline chamber into this chamber.

2708
04:36:31,650 --> 04:36:33,069
He hates streaming.

2709
04:36:34,860 --> 04:36:36,240
No, I don't.

2710
04:36:36,240 --> 04:36:37,900
Stop it, stop it.

2711
04:36:37,900 --> 04:36:41,450
Silence them.

2712
04:36:41,450 --> 04:36:42,729
All right, that's enough.

2713
04:36:42,729 --> 04:36:44,130
Holy shit, it didn't break.

2714
04:36:45,939 --> 04:36:48,220
And then now we need yeast.

2715
04:36:48,220 --> 04:36:56,540
Let's kind of see what happens, to be honest.

2716
04:36:56,540 --> 04:37:03,669
Okay, you've got salt.

2717
04:37:03,669 --> 04:37:33,759
Ooh, right, right, right, right.

2718
04:37:33,759 --> 04:37:45,340
Oh, it's actually stuck in there.

2719
04:37:45,340 --> 04:37:47,259
I can't make any more dough, I don't think ever again.

2720
04:37:47,259 --> 04:37:54,900
Unless I, hold on, bingo.

2721
04:37:54,900 --> 04:37:58,220
All right, I'm gonna actually, let's, let's, hold on.

2722
04:37:58,220 --> 04:37:59,340
Clean up a little bit.

2723
04:37:59,340 --> 04:38:01,540
I wanna actually do, I wanna do one more day of pizzas

2724
04:38:01,540 --> 04:38:05,509
and I'm gonna actually do it well.

2725
04:38:05,509 --> 04:38:12,700
I wanna do an actual day of pizza.

2726
04:38:12,700 --> 04:38:16,250
At least I got to make my favorite pizza.

2727
04:38:16,250 --> 04:38:17,090
Happy about that.

2728
04:38:17,090 --> 04:38:20,099
All right, I need, what do I need more of?

2729
04:38:20,099 --> 04:38:22,290
Let's see.

2730
04:38:22,290 --> 04:38:24,650
I have plenty of, plenty of chicken,

2731
04:38:24,650 --> 04:38:28,860
plenty of sweet corn, which nobody's tried to eat yet.

2732
04:38:29,299 --> 04:38:30,860
I could use more Italian sausages.

2733
04:38:30,860 --> 04:38:33,619
I could use more mushrooms.

2734
04:38:33,619 --> 04:38:36,259
I could use more bacon and marinara sauce

2735
04:38:36,259 --> 04:38:46,200
and just get all the meats.

2736
04:38:46,200 --> 04:38:51,569
So let's do a pepperoni, Italian sausages,

2737
04:38:52,409 --> 04:38:59,819
a prosciutto, a salami, more bacon,

2738
04:38:59,819 --> 04:39:03,139
some, whatever this is.

2739
04:39:07,139 --> 04:39:11,569
Gorgonzola, I'll take some gorgonzola, sure.

2740
04:39:11,569 --> 04:39:20,159
Capers, what else?

2741
04:39:20,159 --> 04:39:24,880
Some young artichokes, couple more.

2742
04:39:24,880 --> 04:39:26,630
I can have a tray of them.

2743
04:39:26,630 --> 04:39:29,500
Cherry tomatoes, just so I can have a tray of them.

2744
04:39:29,500 --> 04:39:33,540
Bunch of lettuce, shredded lettuce on pizza.

2745
04:39:34,580 --> 04:39:35,819
That's, I don't know about that.

2746
04:39:35,819 --> 04:39:37,599
That sounds kind of gross,

2747
04:39:37,599 --> 04:39:41,540
but I'm gonna get it nonetheless.

2748
04:39:41,540 --> 04:39:44,860
Tuna on pizza, that's, also I'm not a fan of that.

2749
04:39:44,860 --> 04:39:47,700
I don't think it seems kind of gross.

2750
04:39:47,700 --> 04:39:50,939
Like, just tuna, like raw tuna?

2751
04:39:50,939 --> 04:39:57,939
I don't know.

2752
04:39:57,939 --> 04:39:59,139
All right, now I gotta figure out

2753
04:39:59,139 --> 04:40:04,330
how I'm gonna wanna do with this.

2754
04:40:04,330 --> 04:40:06,389
I need counter space.

2755
04:40:06,389 --> 04:40:12,869
Okay, we're gonna do shredded lettuce.

2756
04:40:12,869 --> 04:40:13,990
I need a container.

2757
04:40:13,990 --> 04:40:24,369
I'm too lazy to go find one, so I'm just gonna buy one.

2758
04:40:24,369 --> 04:40:26,290
Well, I guess you can only chop the lettuce,

2759
04:40:26,290 --> 04:40:33,830
you can't shred it.

2760
04:40:33,830 --> 04:40:36,869
All of that's gonna go on the floor, mark my words.

2761
04:40:36,869 --> 04:40:48,099
Sure, I disagree.

2762
04:40:48,099 --> 04:40:50,639
Okay, that's enough lettuce.

2763
04:40:52,750 --> 04:40:55,110
Do you chop up the tuna fish or do you just,

2764
04:40:55,110 --> 04:41:00,250
what are you, shredded tuna?

2765
04:41:00,250 --> 04:41:01,130
I can't put this in it.

2766
04:41:01,169 --> 04:41:05,340
Why do I have, what's this for?

2767
04:41:05,340 --> 04:41:06,819
I can't chop it.

2768
04:41:06,819 --> 04:41:09,299
What can I do with it?

2769
04:41:09,299 --> 04:41:16,279
I can put it into the mixer?

2770
04:41:16,279 --> 04:41:18,759
Worst stream 20, what are you, wait, what?

2771
04:41:18,759 --> 04:41:23,869
What are you talking about?

2772
04:41:23,869 --> 04:41:26,799
You don't put it in the mixer.

2773
04:41:26,799 --> 04:41:27,639
What the fuck?

2774
04:41:27,639 --> 04:41:34,139
Why do you put it in the food processor?

2775
04:41:34,139 --> 04:41:36,099
So you just blend it up?

2776
04:41:36,099 --> 04:41:38,090
Wait a minute.

2777
04:41:38,090 --> 04:41:46,810
Okay, well, I lost that tuna.

2778
04:41:46,810 --> 04:41:48,490
But did somebody just say do something weird?

2779
04:41:48,490 --> 04:41:49,650
I just spent like 40 minutes

2780
04:41:49,650 --> 04:41:57,060
making a fucking grilled cheese pizza.

2781
04:41:57,060 --> 04:42:03,009
What?

2782
04:42:03,729 --> 04:42:12,299
Oh, there's still lettuce in there.

2783
04:42:12,299 --> 04:42:14,419
I missed the grilled cheese, do it again.

2784
04:42:14,419 --> 04:42:20,860
Oh, we're gonna make a second grilled cheese pizza.

2785
04:42:20,860 --> 04:42:32,299
Two, two grilled cheese pizzas.

2786
04:42:32,299 --> 04:42:36,939
And then artichokes.

2787
04:42:36,939 --> 04:42:38,979
I'm preparing for tomorrow, so I don't have to do this.

2788
04:42:38,979 --> 04:42:41,299
So I'm not gonna run around from place to place

2789
04:42:41,299 --> 04:42:42,659
and be like, oh my God, I need artichokes.

2790
04:42:42,659 --> 04:42:45,580
And I sprint down and pick up onions instead of artichokes

2791
04:42:45,580 --> 04:42:59,259
and I fuck the whole thing up.

2792
04:42:59,259 --> 04:43:00,419
That doesn't seem like a lot.

2793
04:43:00,419 --> 04:43:04,040
That's not enough.

2794
04:43:04,040 --> 04:43:05,000
That's just a can of capers.

2795
04:43:05,000 --> 04:43:16,180
All right, Italian sausages.

2796
04:43:16,180 --> 04:43:20,470
All right, let's go, go, go, all right, let's go.

2797
04:43:20,509 --> 04:43:31,869
You're making me wanna play this, it's pretty fun.

2798
04:43:31,869 --> 04:43:33,270
All right, give me a pizza.

2799
04:43:33,270 --> 04:43:35,750
I didn't even make any dough.

2800
04:43:35,750 --> 04:43:38,889
Oh, boy, I have this medium pizza here.

2801
04:43:38,889 --> 04:43:41,650
All right, I hope all the pizzas are mediums today.

2802
04:43:41,650 --> 04:43:43,860
You want Italian pizza.

2803
04:43:43,860 --> 04:43:46,790
Italian pizza is Neapolitan dough.

2804
04:43:46,790 --> 04:43:48,430
It's a medium marinara, salami.

2805
04:43:48,430 --> 04:43:52,369
I got all of that, let's go.

2806
04:43:52,369 --> 04:43:55,689
Roll it up.

2807
04:43:55,689 --> 04:43:59,360
Marinara sauce.

2808
04:43:59,360 --> 04:44:01,959
Do another comb stream, asshat.

2809
04:44:01,959 --> 04:44:03,360
Well, I'll tell you one way to make sure

2810
04:44:03,360 --> 04:44:04,680
that I don't do the thing you just said

2811
04:44:04,680 --> 04:44:06,880
is to immediately call me an asshat

2812
04:44:06,880 --> 04:44:09,459
after you request something.

2813
04:44:09,500 --> 04:44:10,900
That's the fastest way for me to go.

2814
04:44:10,900 --> 04:44:13,130
Nah, I don't think so.

2815
04:44:13,130 --> 04:44:20,779
That's like the fastest way for that to happen.

2816
04:44:20,779 --> 04:44:21,619
Okay.

2817
04:44:22,700 --> 04:44:32,020
Cut mozzarella, what's up here?

2818
04:44:32,020 --> 04:44:33,580
Hog.

2819
04:44:33,580 --> 04:44:35,740
Cut salami.

2820
04:44:35,740 --> 04:44:37,380
I think I still have, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2821
04:44:37,380 --> 04:44:41,259
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2822
04:44:41,259 --> 04:44:44,080
64 grams, done.

2823
04:44:44,080 --> 04:44:46,319
Italian sausages, I have a few left, don't I?

2824
04:44:46,319 --> 04:44:47,560
I do.

2825
04:44:47,560 --> 04:44:50,200
Sick.

2826
04:44:50,200 --> 04:44:52,439
50 grams of Italian sausages, do I have enough?

2827
04:44:52,439 --> 04:44:54,680
Please tell me I have enough.

2828
04:44:54,680 --> 04:44:55,680
I do.

2829
04:44:55,680 --> 04:44:58,200
And then cut chili peppers, I don't have the,

2830
04:44:58,200 --> 04:45:01,150
you want ketchup on there?

2831
04:45:01,150 --> 04:45:02,770
No, don't do it.

2832
04:45:02,770 --> 04:45:09,009
Pick it up though, disgusting.

2833
04:45:09,009 --> 04:45:12,950
Chili peppers, they are, okay.

2834
04:45:12,950 --> 04:45:13,790
How many does he want?

2835
04:45:13,790 --> 04:45:19,090
30 grams, he just want one, okay, chop it up.

2836
04:45:19,090 --> 04:45:25,040
Do another 3DO stream, asshat.

2837
04:45:25,040 --> 04:45:27,919
No, no, no, there's a fucking goddamn artichoke in there.

2838
04:45:27,919 --> 04:45:30,759
Fuck, this is why I needed to prepare.

2839
04:45:37,819 --> 04:45:44,560
Why can't I just reach out, reach in and take it out?

2840
04:45:44,560 --> 04:45:47,779
All right, I think I might have to put it on the floor.

2841
04:45:47,779 --> 04:45:49,380
They were right, all of it is on the floor,

2842
04:45:49,380 --> 04:46:03,099
but for very good reason, so I can see it better.

2843
04:46:03,099 --> 04:46:21,630
Just give me this, what are all these?

2844
04:46:21,630 --> 04:46:27,189
Stop calling him an asshat.

2845
04:46:27,189 --> 04:46:30,310
He's so mean, guys, why are you so mean?

2846
04:46:30,310 --> 04:46:36,799
What's with the meanness?

2847
04:46:36,799 --> 04:46:37,639
He's so mean.

2848
04:46:39,299 --> 04:46:51,240
Mean, mean, mean, mean, mean.

2849
04:46:51,240 --> 04:46:53,939
Artichokes, don't worry, I'm making it.

2850
04:46:53,939 --> 04:47:03,459
Your pizza's almost ready.

2851
04:47:03,459 --> 04:47:08,380
Play a children's game for three days in a row?

2852
04:47:08,380 --> 04:47:14,959
I think I've done that before.

2853
04:47:14,959 --> 04:47:20,229
So you want 30 grams of chili peppers, I can do that.

2854
04:47:20,229 --> 04:47:21,970
Should we put a ton of it like hidden

2855
04:47:22,529 --> 04:47:26,659
somewhere over here so he bites into it and goes, oh!

2856
04:47:26,659 --> 04:47:36,360
30, that's evil.

2857
04:47:36,360 --> 04:47:45,060
Is it evil?

2858
04:47:45,060 --> 04:47:47,259
You literally only play children's games.

2859
04:47:49,720 --> 04:47:56,689
That's not even accurate, you know it.

2860
04:47:56,689 --> 04:47:58,060
What do you mean it's not done?

2861
04:47:58,060 --> 04:48:01,680
Mozzarella, salami, there's olives on this damn thing.

2862
04:48:01,680 --> 04:48:06,490
I keep, anytime I see the word olive, I just glaze over it.

2863
04:48:06,490 --> 04:48:16,490
Quick, get it out, get it out, get it out, get it out.

2864
04:48:16,490 --> 04:48:18,569
Who even have, I have a jar of black olives somewhere.

2865
04:48:18,569 --> 04:48:30,790
Where is it?

2866
04:48:30,790 --> 04:48:38,299
Shit.

2867
04:48:38,299 --> 04:48:45,240
Olives, olives, olives, come on, come on, come on.

2868
04:48:45,240 --> 04:48:48,240
Oh shit, how do I take them out?

2869
04:48:49,270 --> 04:48:56,319
I, what do I, how do I, what do I put these?

2870
04:48:56,319 --> 04:48:58,360
I swear to God, if there's something in here already,

2871
04:48:58,360 --> 04:49:06,630
I'm gonna be very mad.

2872
04:49:06,630 --> 04:49:08,229
Thank God, okay, there's not.

2873
04:49:08,229 --> 04:49:19,549
We're good.

2874
04:49:19,549 --> 04:49:22,450
You're eating olives from the jar right now.

2875
04:49:22,450 --> 04:49:26,180
Nice, that's pretty cool.

2876
04:49:26,180 --> 04:49:27,259
Maybe they're good for you.

2877
04:49:27,259 --> 04:49:32,700
I just don't like them.

2878
04:49:32,700 --> 04:49:43,950
64 grams of black olives.

2879
04:49:43,950 --> 04:49:46,189
Holy fuck, that was too much.

2880
04:49:46,189 --> 04:49:58,919
Whatever.

2881
04:49:58,919 --> 04:50:01,430
Black olives on a pizza are bad.

2882
04:50:01,430 --> 04:50:05,009
It just, olives in general, I like, I love olive oil,

2883
04:50:05,009 --> 04:50:07,310
but black olives especially, they're very,

2884
04:50:07,310 --> 04:50:09,569
they're kind of, they're like acidic.

2885
04:50:10,409 --> 04:50:18,400
They have a super like soury kind of flavor to them.

2886
04:50:18,400 --> 04:50:27,119
They're like, bleh, not for me, not for me.

2887
04:50:27,119 --> 04:50:31,459
Black olives are better than green olives.

2888
04:50:31,459 --> 04:50:34,939
I actually kind of, I don't mind green olives.

2889
04:50:34,939 --> 04:50:45,090
Throw it on a chicouterie board or something.

2890
04:50:45,090 --> 04:50:49,009
That was a truth bomb, bro.

2891
04:50:49,009 --> 04:50:51,200
Thanks, I guess.

2892
04:50:51,200 --> 04:50:53,310
We have a new offer?

2893
04:50:53,310 --> 04:50:56,470
I don't click on new offer links unless it is confirmed

2894
04:50:56,470 --> 04:51:06,759
that it is a actual new offer.

2895
04:51:06,759 --> 04:51:08,560
It's official, official, official, official.

2896
04:51:08,560 --> 04:51:16,000
Okay, hold on.

2897
04:51:16,040 --> 04:51:18,599
We're saying it's official.

2898
04:51:18,599 --> 04:51:22,439
We're calling this an official, official.

2899
04:51:22,439 --> 04:51:29,439
Okay, let me look at it.

2900
04:51:29,439 --> 04:51:33,700
Let me see, what is it?

2901
04:51:33,700 --> 04:51:34,939
Limited time offer.

2902
04:51:34,939 --> 04:51:37,540
Sell as many pizzas as possible in one game day.

2903
04:51:37,540 --> 04:51:48,450
All profits paid 200 times off the debt.

2904
04:51:48,450 --> 04:51:49,610
How much?

2905
04:51:49,610 --> 04:51:51,040
Deal?

2906
04:51:51,040 --> 04:51:52,279
Deal?

2907
04:51:52,279 --> 04:52:03,990
Is it a deal?

2908
04:52:03,990 --> 04:52:05,229
I got a deal.

2909
04:52:05,229 --> 04:52:11,369
Go.

2910
04:52:11,369 --> 04:52:12,490
It doesn't even matter what the pizzas are.

2911
04:52:12,490 --> 04:52:17,700
They're getting bread.

2912
04:52:17,700 --> 04:52:20,279
Oh no, I got my ketchup in the fucking onion tray.

2913
04:52:21,970 --> 04:52:27,099
What do you mean it doesn't count?

2914
04:52:27,099 --> 04:52:28,740
You didn't say I had to make their pizzas correctly.

2915
04:52:28,740 --> 04:52:40,610
You just said I had to make them.

2916
04:52:40,610 --> 04:52:42,619
And here's one right here.

2917
04:52:42,619 --> 04:52:46,860
How much is this worth?

2918
04:52:46,860 --> 04:52:48,689
How can I see the price?

2919
04:52:48,689 --> 04:52:50,080
Okay.

2920
04:52:50,080 --> 04:52:52,080
How much was it?

2921
04:52:52,080 --> 04:52:53,840
190 cents?

2922
04:52:53,840 --> 04:53:00,909
Oh, that's not very much times 200.

2923
04:53:00,909 --> 04:53:03,900
Okay, let's go.

2924
04:53:03,900 --> 04:53:08,220
Next up we have a mimosa pizza,

2925
04:53:08,220 --> 04:53:09,700
which is Alfredo sauce.

2926
04:53:09,700 --> 04:53:11,580
Is it a Neapolitan Alfredo?

2927
04:53:11,580 --> 04:53:20,709
It doesn't matter.

2928
04:53:20,709 --> 04:53:23,349
Give that back.

2929
04:53:23,389 --> 04:53:24,209
What are you doing?

2930
04:53:24,209 --> 04:53:25,049
Give this back.

2931
04:53:25,049 --> 04:53:31,299
What the hell?

2932
04:53:31,299 --> 04:53:32,700
Give my tray back.

2933
04:53:37,389 --> 04:53:44,380
What's going on?

2934
04:53:44,380 --> 04:53:45,599
Give me a fucking break.

2935
04:53:45,599 --> 04:53:49,020
Are you kidding me?

2936
04:53:49,020 --> 04:53:49,860
What's blocking?

2937
04:53:49,860 --> 04:53:51,340
Is something blocking it?

2938
04:53:51,340 --> 04:54:00,860
Something in the way?

2939
04:54:00,860 --> 04:54:01,860
Okay, mimosa.

2940
04:54:01,860 --> 04:54:04,939
You want onions on there.

2941
04:54:05,939 --> 04:54:07,299
You want bacon on there too?

2942
04:54:07,299 --> 04:54:09,180
I didn't even put any sauce on there.

2943
04:54:09,180 --> 04:54:10,459
Deal with it.

2944
04:54:10,459 --> 04:54:14,189
That's a turbo 985 special, onions and bacon.

2945
04:54:14,189 --> 04:54:16,659
What did you want on yours?

2946
04:54:16,659 --> 04:54:18,020
Oh, pesto?

2947
04:54:18,020 --> 04:54:20,630
You got it.

2948
04:54:20,790 --> 04:54:21,990
And way too many hot peppers,

2949
04:54:21,990 --> 04:54:23,549
so it's gonna burn the fuck out of your mouth

2950
04:54:23,549 --> 04:54:28,650
and you won't even be able to enjoy anything.

2951
04:54:28,650 --> 04:54:29,569
Pesto and hot peppers,

2952
04:54:29,569 --> 04:54:33,200
that's too much acidity in your mouth.

2953
04:54:33,200 --> 04:54:35,580
That'll be $12.

2954
04:54:35,580 --> 04:54:38,319
And I'm giving you a chicken breast.

2955
04:54:38,319 --> 04:54:40,580
You're just gonna have hot pie.

2956
04:54:40,580 --> 04:54:50,979
Okay, where are the potatoes?

2957
04:54:55,659 --> 04:54:59,099
You dumped out what was the contents of your shredder.

2958
04:54:59,099 --> 04:55:03,849
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2959
04:55:03,849 --> 04:55:10,389
Hurry, hurry.

2960
04:55:10,389 --> 04:55:26,389
Is anything gonna fit in there?

2961
04:55:26,389 --> 04:55:31,029
That's Timmy's school project.

2962
04:55:31,029 --> 04:55:33,900
It's like paper mache.

2963
04:55:33,900 --> 04:55:36,060
Yeah, you made a paper mache solar system.

2964
04:55:36,060 --> 04:55:39,259
It's like, Timmy, that does not look at all

2965
04:55:39,259 --> 04:55:44,740
like our galaxy, but you know, as you tried.

2966
04:55:44,740 --> 04:55:50,639
Hot oven, let's go.

2967
04:55:50,639 --> 04:55:59,340
Okay, okay, okay, okay, come on, come on, come on, come on.

2968
04:55:59,340 --> 04:56:00,180
Time?

2969
04:56:00,180 --> 04:56:14,459
Nope, no, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter.

2970
04:56:14,459 --> 04:56:23,419
Take it out, it's ready.

2971
04:56:23,419 --> 04:56:25,580
Okay, it's ready to serve.

2972
04:56:28,540 --> 04:56:29,979
Does that go out the window?

2973
04:56:29,979 --> 04:56:30,819
Fuck.

2974
04:56:30,860 --> 04:56:36,360
I need to get the other one.

2975
04:56:36,360 --> 04:56:39,520
It's a tumbleweed.

2976
04:56:39,520 --> 04:56:41,689
It's like a chia pet.

2977
04:56:41,689 --> 04:57:00,939
All right, I need plates, plates, plates, quick.

2978
04:57:00,939 --> 04:57:02,580
All right, this is like a plant

2979
04:57:02,580 --> 04:57:04,700
that's in the corner of your office.

2980
04:57:04,700 --> 04:57:12,319
All right, who ordered the mimosa?

2981
04:57:12,319 --> 04:57:14,020
You just hear off in the distance.

2982
04:57:21,080 --> 04:57:34,979
$125.

2983
04:57:34,979 --> 04:57:37,229
Why would they eat it?

2984
04:57:37,229 --> 04:57:55,659
They didn't, they just saw it.

2985
04:57:55,659 --> 04:57:57,540
And this is a meat pizza.

2986
04:57:58,459 --> 04:57:59,299
What's next?

2987
04:57:59,299 --> 04:58:01,490
More, more, more, more, more.

2988
04:58:01,490 --> 04:58:03,409
Oh, no, I didn't like it.

2989
04:58:03,409 --> 04:58:05,409
I liked the sauce, though.

2990
04:58:05,409 --> 04:58:08,220
The cheese was not very good.

2991
04:58:08,220 --> 04:58:09,740
But I was a big fan of the sauce.

2992
04:58:09,740 --> 04:58:10,860
There was no sauce on that pizza.

2993
04:58:10,860 --> 04:58:16,099
It was just shredded up hair.

2994
04:58:16,099 --> 04:58:18,979
Oh, take it out.

2995
04:58:18,979 --> 04:58:28,880
Where's mine?

2996
04:58:28,880 --> 04:58:34,990
That actually looks so awful, for real.

2997
04:58:34,990 --> 04:58:36,669
I need another piece of dough.

2998
04:58:36,669 --> 04:58:39,450
Here we go.

2999
04:58:39,450 --> 04:58:46,840
Roll it.

3000
04:58:46,840 --> 04:58:49,060
I don't know what, you have lettuce, too.

3001
04:58:49,060 --> 04:58:52,700
And artichokes.

3002
04:58:52,700 --> 04:58:55,450
And I have a lot of sweet corn,

3003
04:58:55,450 --> 04:59:00,299
so might as well use it.

3004
04:59:00,299 --> 04:59:04,400
And I guess you can have, here, have some like,

3005
04:59:04,400 --> 04:59:10,330
no, have some Alfredo sauce.

3006
04:59:11,130 --> 04:59:19,630
And bacon, shit.

3007
04:59:19,630 --> 04:59:30,689
Okay, I'm gonna do the middle finger in bacon.

3008
04:59:30,689 --> 04:59:44,180
Can I?

3009
04:59:44,180 --> 04:59:53,919
Not even close, but whatever.

3010
04:59:53,919 --> 05:00:06,860
I think I could get it, though.

3011
05:00:06,860 --> 05:00:08,419
You've hit a bacon ceiling.

3012
05:00:10,630 --> 05:00:20,639
I still have a shitload of chicken.

3013
05:00:20,639 --> 05:00:34,939
Whatever, I don't care.

3014
05:00:34,939 --> 05:00:35,779
Do you like this game,

3015
05:00:35,779 --> 05:00:37,580
or do you just have Stockholm syndrome?

3016
05:00:41,020 --> 05:00:41,860
No, it's fun.

3017
05:00:41,860 --> 05:01:00,680
All right, I have to spell fuck you out on this one.

3018
05:01:00,680 --> 05:01:01,759
I need more peppers.

3019
05:01:01,759 --> 05:01:11,180
Shit.

3020
05:01:11,180 --> 05:01:12,459
Or do I, though?

3021
05:01:12,459 --> 05:01:13,639
Do I, though?

3022
05:01:13,639 --> 05:01:27,349
No, I don't.

3023
05:01:27,349 --> 05:01:39,900
I can't put anything on here.

3024
05:01:40,299 --> 05:01:41,139
Oh, shit.

3025
05:01:45,419 --> 05:01:46,979
This is done.

3026
05:01:46,979 --> 05:01:47,819
Oh.

3027
05:01:50,990 --> 05:01:53,909
This looks like a dead bird.

3028
05:01:55,419 --> 05:02:03,069
It's disgusting.

3029
05:02:03,069 --> 05:02:03,990
It is.

3030
05:02:06,680 --> 05:02:10,619
I just put a dead bird on the pizza.

3031
05:02:10,619 --> 05:02:12,040
That's disgusting.

3032
05:02:20,750 --> 05:02:22,869
Oh, that's disgusting.

3033
05:02:22,909 --> 05:02:24,930
That is absolutely revolting.

3034
05:02:34,450 --> 05:02:36,009
It just looks like charcoal.

3035
05:02:38,400 --> 05:02:39,520
Well, we ran out of toppings.

3036
05:02:39,520 --> 05:02:40,360
We ran out of meat,

3037
05:02:40,360 --> 05:02:41,959
so might as well use some of the wood,

3038
05:02:41,959 --> 05:02:44,220
the charcoal on the bottom.

3039
05:02:44,220 --> 05:02:57,689
At least it'll be smoky.

3040
05:02:57,689 --> 05:03:04,279
Dude, the health department would elbow drop you.

3041
05:03:04,279 --> 05:03:05,119
Is this one done?

3042
05:03:05,119 --> 05:03:19,380
It is.

3043
05:03:19,380 --> 05:03:24,540
I think this is the end.

3044
05:03:24,540 --> 05:03:33,430
I can't even process this anymore.

3045
05:03:33,430 --> 05:03:38,439
Oh, okay.

3046
05:03:38,439 --> 05:03:39,360
No, no, I'm not done with the day.

3047
05:03:39,360 --> 05:03:42,700
I'm just saying, I think this is it.

3048
05:03:42,700 --> 05:03:46,000
No, I didn't.

3049
05:03:46,000 --> 05:03:50,459
I need this all medium pizzas.

3050
05:03:50,459 --> 05:03:51,540
Whoa, that almost hit my head.

3051
05:03:51,540 --> 05:03:52,380
Wait, was that a...

3052
05:03:52,380 --> 05:03:59,979
What was in there?

3053
05:03:59,979 --> 05:04:18,869
Okay, one, two, three.

3054
05:04:18,869 --> 05:04:20,189
What even is this?

3055
05:04:22,990 --> 05:04:24,869
This is what I feel like it would look like

3056
05:04:24,869 --> 05:04:33,500
if McDonald's started doing pizza.

3057
05:04:33,500 --> 05:04:34,500
What about the shit in the oven?

3058
05:04:34,500 --> 05:04:42,090
Oh, whatever, I'll get it.

3059
05:04:42,090 --> 05:04:45,229
Oh, that's a Caprice pizza.

3060
05:04:45,229 --> 05:04:50,020
What's in here?

3061
05:04:50,020 --> 05:04:52,819
Okay, you sicko.

3062
05:04:52,819 --> 05:04:53,979
I guess he liked it a little.

3063
05:04:53,979 --> 05:04:56,729
He just didn't like the cheese.

3064
05:04:56,729 --> 05:04:58,790
It's not burning.

3065
05:04:58,790 --> 05:05:00,630
It's not even...

3066
05:05:00,630 --> 05:05:11,689
I need to put wood in here.

3067
05:05:11,689 --> 05:05:19,090
Okay, this one's done.

3068
05:05:19,090 --> 05:05:25,720
This just looks like what a baby's food tray looks like.

3069
05:05:25,720 --> 05:05:39,400
An infant that you feed, like Cheerios do.

3070
05:05:39,400 --> 05:05:47,549
Baby spelling out fuck.

3071
05:05:47,549 --> 05:05:48,869
I can't, I can't even.

3072
05:05:48,869 --> 05:05:50,349
This is a cheese pizza.

3073
05:05:50,349 --> 05:05:52,069
Is there even cheese on the pizza?

3074
05:05:52,069 --> 05:05:58,419
Everything but cheese.

3075
05:05:58,419 --> 05:06:00,220
You ordered a cheese pizza.

3076
05:06:00,220 --> 05:06:04,299
You sure you didn't want corn and olives?

3077
05:06:04,299 --> 05:06:06,099
Whatever the fuck it was.

3078
05:06:06,099 --> 05:06:08,020
All right, I'm like Mr. Giggles right now.

3079
05:06:08,020 --> 05:06:23,930
I gotta calm down.

3080
05:06:23,930 --> 05:06:26,130
You ever sometimes even just kind of sit there and go,

3081
05:06:26,130 --> 05:06:29,020
you know, what would I actually do

3082
05:06:29,020 --> 05:06:30,930
if somebody served me that?

3083
05:06:30,930 --> 05:06:32,580
Here's what I would do.

3084
05:06:32,580 --> 05:06:34,099
I would turn around.

3085
05:06:34,099 --> 05:06:35,779
If somebody put this in front of me.

3086
05:06:35,779 --> 05:06:41,150
Here you go, sir and madam, here is your pizza.

3087
05:06:41,150 --> 05:06:42,549
I'd go, okay, well the way that you're like

3088
05:06:42,549 --> 05:06:43,549
being like a waiter guy.

3089
05:06:43,549 --> 05:06:44,709
Okay, where's the camera?

3090
05:06:44,709 --> 05:06:45,549
I would look around and be like,

3091
05:06:45,549 --> 05:06:46,750
there's probably a camera back here.

3092
05:06:46,750 --> 05:06:48,869
There's a hidden camera there, a hidden camera there.

3093
05:06:49,909 --> 05:06:51,430
Like you're like an actor waiter.

3094
05:06:51,430 --> 05:06:52,270
You already did that part.

3095
05:06:52,270 --> 05:06:53,110
You came over and you were like,

3096
05:06:53,189 --> 05:06:55,630
sir and madam, I'm over here with your pizza.

3097
05:06:55,630 --> 05:06:56,950
You're obviously an actor.

3098
05:06:56,950 --> 05:06:59,470
So that part is, you gave it away already.

3099
05:07:10,259 --> 05:07:16,459
It doesn't matter, they still paid for it.

3100
05:07:16,459 --> 05:07:20,049
Ow, my hand.

3101
05:07:20,049 --> 05:07:25,049
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3102
05:07:35,459 --> 05:07:42,740
It kind of looks like a little guy holding like a brick.

3103
05:07:42,740 --> 05:07:49,740
It's like a little rock guy holding up a rock.

3104
05:07:49,740 --> 05:07:50,619
It's like a little dude

3105
05:07:50,619 --> 05:08:00,849
and he's holding a rock in his hand.

3106
05:08:00,849 --> 05:08:05,400
He's about to dunk the basketball.

3107
05:08:05,439 --> 05:08:07,319
Whoa, okay, cool.

3108
05:08:07,319 --> 05:08:08,319
I like that one.

3109
05:08:08,319 --> 05:08:12,959
I'm keeping this one.

3110
05:08:12,959 --> 05:08:20,900
Nobody can have this one, this one's mine.

3111
05:08:20,900 --> 05:08:21,740
How many orders do I have?

3112
05:08:21,740 --> 05:08:23,299
Four, I don't have any dough left.

3113
05:08:29,119 --> 05:08:38,580
Let me just do this.

3114
05:08:38,580 --> 05:08:57,849
Is it ketchup?

3115
05:08:57,849 --> 05:09:01,630
I can't just serve ketchup on a plate.

3116
05:09:01,630 --> 05:09:02,869
Look for dough.

3117
05:09:02,869 --> 05:09:04,630
We're looking for dough on the ground.

3118
05:09:04,630 --> 05:09:06,849
You see it, let me know.

3119
05:09:06,849 --> 05:09:28,470
Oh, there we go.

3120
05:09:28,470 --> 05:09:30,830
Tuna and ketchup, that's disgusting.

3121
05:09:30,830 --> 05:09:36,700
Oh, oh, I almost gagged.

3122
05:09:36,700 --> 05:09:44,130
Tuna, ketchup and milk.

3123
05:09:44,130 --> 05:10:01,939
Sure, why not?

3124
05:10:01,979 --> 05:10:05,470
This caused me physical harm thinking about this.

3125
05:10:05,470 --> 05:10:12,659
Oh boy.

3126
05:10:12,659 --> 05:10:52,270
So we have our ketchup and tuna sauce with milk based.

3127
05:10:52,270 --> 05:11:02,279
Oh no, out of ketchup.

3128
05:11:02,279 --> 05:11:20,139
That might be bad.

3129
05:11:20,139 --> 05:11:22,500
I can't just serve a piece of wood.

3130
05:11:22,500 --> 05:11:26,819
I wish I could.

3131
05:11:26,819 --> 05:11:30,939
It was even, oh, it was ketchup.

3132
05:11:30,939 --> 05:11:35,979
Oh, do you want ketchup in wood?

3133
05:11:35,979 --> 05:11:37,020
I feel like that's the kind of shit

3134
05:11:37,020 --> 05:11:37,860
that we're gonna be eating

3135
05:11:37,860 --> 05:11:40,840
when like the apocalypse happens.

3136
05:11:40,840 --> 05:11:47,439
Did you eat your, son, did you eat your wood?

3137
05:11:47,439 --> 05:11:48,880
Just put some ketchup on it.

3138
05:11:48,880 --> 05:11:54,340
That's like all we have left is just ketchup.

3139
05:11:54,340 --> 05:11:58,419
God damn it, hold on.

3140
05:11:58,419 --> 05:11:59,419
I think I can do it.

3141
05:11:59,419 --> 05:12:02,279
I'm gonna try.

3142
05:12:02,279 --> 05:12:03,799
I put some wood in the grinder.

3143
05:12:03,799 --> 05:12:10,779
Can I make like a wood sauce?

3144
05:12:10,779 --> 05:12:13,540
Hold on, can I, I can't chop up the wood.

3145
05:12:13,540 --> 05:12:24,259
I can't shred up the wood.

3146
05:12:24,259 --> 05:12:25,500
Oh well.

3147
05:12:25,500 --> 05:12:29,689
Okay, put this in.

3148
05:12:29,689 --> 05:12:34,790
What is, oh, I just, extra sauce, okay.

3149
05:12:34,790 --> 05:12:38,950
Somebody said this looks like a crime scene.

3150
05:12:38,950 --> 05:12:39,909
Yeah, let's break it down.

3151
05:12:39,909 --> 05:12:46,299
Okay, so let's say we came from here.

3152
05:12:46,340 --> 05:12:47,180
We open the front door.

3153
05:12:47,180 --> 05:12:50,500
Let's go, let's open the front door.

3154
05:12:50,500 --> 05:12:51,340
Where's the front door?

3155
05:12:51,340 --> 05:12:52,549
Over here, okay.

3156
05:12:52,549 --> 05:12:56,580
So, we open up here.

3157
05:12:56,580 --> 05:12:57,889
Cha-ching!

3158
05:12:57,889 --> 05:13:03,400
Okay, so very obviously, it was a struggle, right?

3159
05:13:03,400 --> 05:13:04,599
It was this, and peppers on the ground.

3160
05:13:04,599 --> 05:13:06,720
The person was definitely had just gone downstairs

3161
05:13:06,720 --> 05:13:10,060
to get something from the pantry, right?

3162
05:13:10,060 --> 05:13:11,299
You've obviously filled the pantry with this,

3163
05:13:11,299 --> 05:13:12,779
but it's on the ground now.

3164
05:13:12,779 --> 05:13:14,909
Why is it on the ground?

3165
05:13:14,909 --> 05:13:16,639
Window open.

3166
05:13:16,639 --> 05:13:17,479
Why is the window open?

3167
05:13:17,479 --> 05:13:18,959
Perpetrator may have escaped through the window

3168
05:13:18,959 --> 05:13:23,619
in the second floor pantry and kitchen area.

3169
05:13:23,659 --> 05:13:25,779
Coming through here.

3170
05:13:25,779 --> 05:13:27,689
Perpetrator pissed on the ground, too.

3171
05:13:27,689 --> 05:13:28,610
Marking his territory.

3172
05:13:28,610 --> 05:13:32,220
Perpetrator could be a dog.

3173
05:13:32,220 --> 05:13:37,319
Perpetrator could be a rabid dog.

3174
05:13:37,319 --> 05:13:38,639
Guy was coming up from the pantry.

3175
05:13:38,639 --> 05:13:40,639
Dog smelled the aroma.

3176
05:13:40,639 --> 05:13:43,830
Rabid dog jumped through the window.

3177
05:13:43,830 --> 05:13:45,720
Let's see what else.

3178
05:13:45,720 --> 05:13:49,500
Oh, and there it is.

3179
05:13:49,500 --> 05:13:51,259
He must've, he could've, this is two attacks

3180
05:13:51,259 --> 05:13:52,180
probably at the same time.

3181
05:13:52,180 --> 05:13:54,869
Bludgeoned by the dough case.

3182
05:13:54,869 --> 05:13:57,439
Smashed his head right on here.

3183
05:13:57,439 --> 05:13:58,840
His brain matter flew over all the way

3184
05:13:58,840 --> 05:14:03,009
to the left side of the kitchen.

3185
05:14:03,009 --> 05:14:04,200
There's no body.

3186
05:14:04,200 --> 05:14:07,009
Where's the body?

3187
05:14:07,009 --> 05:14:09,049
We're closing for today, and we finished where you,

3188
05:14:09,090 --> 05:14:10,090
oh, get out of here.

3189
05:14:10,090 --> 05:14:13,959
I'm busy.

3190
05:14:13,959 --> 05:14:15,840
It's a, it's the pizza.

3191
05:14:22,630 --> 05:14:29,110
That's not a whole lot of blood on the counter.

3192
05:14:29,110 --> 05:14:31,009
Blood on the counter.

3193
05:14:31,009 --> 05:14:35,970
And this dough looks really, really, really weird to me.

3194
05:14:35,970 --> 05:14:38,209
Hold on, let me go down.

3195
05:14:38,209 --> 05:14:39,650
Yep, okay.

3196
05:14:39,650 --> 05:14:41,770
That's human flesh.

3197
05:14:41,770 --> 05:14:46,139
Human flesh.

3198
05:14:46,139 --> 05:14:47,540
Multiple piss wounds.

3199
05:14:47,540 --> 05:14:52,110
Multiple, multiple blood stains.

3200
05:14:52,110 --> 05:14:54,029
And then somebody baked somebody into,

3201
05:14:54,029 --> 05:14:58,740
oh, he's gonna bake him into a pizza.

3202
05:14:59,299 --> 05:15:08,840
What would you even think coming in here?

3203
05:15:08,840 --> 05:15:13,720
Another open window, escape through this window too.

3204
05:15:13,720 --> 05:15:15,439
Nice band name, multiple piss wounds.

3205
05:15:15,439 --> 05:15:16,720
I said that and everybody hated it.

3206
05:15:16,720 --> 05:15:22,419
You said that and they all laughed.

3207
05:15:22,419 --> 05:15:24,220
This looks like somebody just like chair shot

3208
05:15:24,220 --> 05:15:29,740
at somebody just bang right in the back of the head like.

3209
05:15:29,740 --> 05:15:35,529
This place is a fucking mess.

3210
05:15:35,529 --> 05:15:38,650
Okay, let's cook this last pizza and then I'm done.

3211
05:15:38,650 --> 05:15:47,669
I'm done.

3212
05:15:47,669 --> 05:15:52,700
Oh, things don't break anymore, right?

3213
05:15:52,700 --> 05:15:53,580
Turn the heat up.

3214
05:15:53,580 --> 05:15:54,540
Let's burn this.

3215
05:15:54,540 --> 05:16:18,099
Let's burn this until like it actually sets the place on fire.

3216
05:16:18,099 --> 05:16:21,450
Is this my pizza shovel?

3217
05:16:21,450 --> 05:16:25,229
God, I have no idea.

3218
05:16:25,229 --> 05:16:43,180
Oh, here it is.

3219
05:16:43,180 --> 05:16:44,060
Too hot.

3220
05:16:44,060 --> 05:16:47,080
Oven is too hot.

3221
05:16:47,080 --> 05:16:51,669
We're getting to extreme levels of heat.

3222
05:16:51,669 --> 05:16:56,560
Where's the gas tank?

3223
05:16:56,560 --> 05:16:58,979
Where is the gas tank?

3224
05:16:58,979 --> 05:17:01,020
Oh, right, it got, it disappeared.

3225
05:17:01,020 --> 05:17:15,369
Can I buy another one?

3226
05:17:15,369 --> 05:17:24,580
What's the point of the gas tank?

3227
05:17:24,580 --> 05:17:25,779
I can't put it anywhere.

3228
05:17:29,700 --> 05:17:50,740
It's for gas, but gas to what?

3229
05:17:50,740 --> 05:17:59,950
I don't think it can explode.

3230
05:17:59,950 --> 05:18:07,680
It's a nerve agent.

3231
05:18:07,680 --> 05:18:09,759
It's a nerve agent.

3232
05:18:09,759 --> 05:18:11,119
All right, let's get that pizza out of there.

3233
05:18:11,119 --> 05:18:13,720
Mm, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum,

3234
05:18:13,759 --> 05:18:15,180
Scrumptious.

3235
05:18:15,180 --> 05:18:29,540
Mm, I actually kind of feel like this would be

3236
05:18:29,540 --> 05:18:33,310
a weird appetizer at a really expensive restaurant.

3237
05:18:33,310 --> 05:18:39,139
It doesn't really even look that bad.

3238
05:18:39,139 --> 05:18:53,720
Extra sauce on there.

3239
05:18:53,720 --> 05:18:56,400
Holy shit, what, what?

3240
05:18:56,400 --> 05:18:58,459
What?

3241
05:18:58,459 --> 05:19:00,060
That just scared the absolute hell out of me.

3242
05:19:00,060 --> 05:19:04,060
I didn't know you could do that.

3243
05:19:04,060 --> 05:19:07,189
Oh, crime scene.

3244
05:19:07,189 --> 05:19:11,209
Well, this looks like a typical,

3245
05:19:11,209 --> 05:19:13,650
typical game of I'm going to try to,

3246
05:19:13,650 --> 05:19:15,290
I'm going to put a chair here

3247
05:19:15,290 --> 05:19:29,750
and jump into the ceiling fair with my head.

3248
05:19:29,750 --> 05:19:34,979
That's so, it must have been,

3249
05:19:35,020 --> 05:19:36,060
yeah, it must have been making a really,

3250
05:19:36,060 --> 05:19:39,700
really crazy YouTube video.

3251
05:19:39,700 --> 05:19:41,979
The guy got shredded.

3252
05:19:41,979 --> 05:19:43,380
His body doesn't even exist.

3253
05:19:43,380 --> 05:19:53,060
It's just blood.

3254
05:19:53,060 --> 05:19:54,700
Of all the things you can break in this game,

3255
05:19:54,700 --> 05:19:58,319
the ceiling fan, really?

3256
05:19:58,319 --> 05:20:10,150
You can't like blow up the oven.

3257
05:20:10,150 --> 05:20:11,069
Where's the blood pizza?

3258
05:20:11,069 --> 05:20:13,540
Here it is.

3259
05:20:13,540 --> 05:20:27,599
Oh, I got to serve this to somebody, right.

3260
05:20:27,599 --> 05:20:29,279
Need a blow torch?

3261
05:20:29,279 --> 05:20:33,979
I just don't have it unlocked.

3262
05:20:33,979 --> 05:20:37,619
There's an artichoke on there.

3263
05:20:37,619 --> 05:20:42,049
Oh, oh well.

3264
05:20:42,049 --> 05:20:43,409
We're closing, I have to, wait,

3265
05:20:43,409 --> 05:20:46,389
I still have to fulfill these orders?

3266
05:20:46,430 --> 05:20:48,330
Cheese.

3267
05:20:48,330 --> 05:20:56,979
Okay, do I, I don't think I don't have any more dough.

3268
05:20:56,979 --> 05:21:00,169
I actually don't have any more dough.

3269
05:21:00,169 --> 05:21:02,369
Oh, fuck, just make dog, just make shit dough.

3270
05:21:02,369 --> 05:21:07,759
Who cares?

3271
05:21:07,759 --> 05:21:12,099
Down the stairs?

3272
05:21:12,099 --> 05:21:15,459
Oh, yes, yes.

3273
05:21:15,459 --> 05:21:17,060
They're like slam dunk pizza.

3274
05:21:17,060 --> 05:21:24,139
I forgot about slam dunk pizza.

3275
05:21:24,139 --> 05:21:34,779
Wait, I want to see it one more time.

3276
05:21:34,779 --> 05:21:43,220
I want to see it.

3277
05:21:43,220 --> 05:21:44,060
There he goes.

3278
05:21:44,060 --> 05:21:50,459
He's reaching out to do a big slam dunk.

3279
05:21:50,459 --> 05:21:52,159
Nice.

3280
05:21:52,159 --> 05:21:54,580
All right, cool.

3281
05:21:54,580 --> 05:21:55,400
Here, you can have it.

3282
05:21:55,400 --> 05:22:10,819
It's a cheese pizza.

3283
05:22:10,860 --> 05:22:13,810
I kind of don't want to sell it, but I have to.

3284
05:22:13,810 --> 05:22:14,650
Didn't even have to.

3285
05:22:14,650 --> 05:22:16,779
All right, nope, she has to take a plate.

3286
05:22:16,779 --> 05:22:17,740
I get to keep the pizza.

3287
05:22:17,740 --> 05:22:20,680
You motherfucker, it's mine.

3288
05:22:20,680 --> 05:22:28,729
All right, that was it.

3289
05:22:28,729 --> 05:22:29,569
Billy is such a joke.

3290
05:22:29,569 --> 05:22:31,419
Like, why do I have to do this?

3291
05:22:31,419 --> 05:22:33,580
I can't just like play the game normally.

3292
05:22:33,580 --> 05:22:38,500
I have to like fucking make like piss stains everywhere.

3293
05:22:38,500 --> 05:22:39,700
All right, I'm out.

3294
05:22:39,700 --> 05:22:41,430
I'm done.

3295
05:22:41,430 --> 05:22:49,659
Let's see how much money I made.

3296
05:22:49,659 --> 05:22:52,990
$765.

3297
05:22:52,990 --> 05:23:00,580
So that's times 200, which is 70, that's not even,

3298
05:23:01,020 --> 05:23:05,099
that's like nothing.

3299
05:23:05,099 --> 05:23:07,599
In the grand scheme of the massive amount of debt,

3300
05:23:07,599 --> 05:23:14,610
that's only the $153,000.

3301
05:23:14,610 --> 05:23:19,880
I thought it was going to be like at least a million.

3302
05:23:19,880 --> 05:23:22,279
It was honest work.

3303
05:23:22,279 --> 05:23:26,959
153K is not bad.

3304
05:23:26,959 --> 05:23:30,159
That sense not, no, you can't take sense off of the debt.

3305
05:23:30,159 --> 05:23:36,560
That doesn't make any sense.

3306
05:23:36,560 --> 05:23:40,340
I was fucking around too much, yeah.

3307
05:23:40,340 --> 05:23:42,439
All right, I will see you guys.

3308
05:23:45,619 --> 05:23:49,189
Let me see.

3309
05:23:49,189 --> 05:23:53,509
It's today, Friday.

3310
05:23:53,509 --> 05:23:57,340
I got something I got to do tomorrow.

3311
05:23:57,380 --> 05:24:06,139
So there's something that I have to take care of tomorrow.

3312
05:24:06,139 --> 05:24:07,659
I was going to go today and tomorrow,

3313
05:24:07,659 --> 05:24:14,220
but something came up like it sometimes does.

3314
05:24:14,220 --> 05:24:17,509
So you know, here's what we'll probably do.

3315
05:24:17,509 --> 05:24:20,069
I'll probably go,

3316
05:24:20,069 --> 05:24:22,069
I'll probably do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday this week

3317
05:24:22,069 --> 05:24:25,900
coming up.

3318
05:24:25,900 --> 05:24:27,180
Cause I know I've done like one day, one day,

3319
05:24:27,180 --> 05:24:28,000
one day, one day.

3320
05:24:28,000 --> 05:24:29,840
Let's just, I'll take the weekend

3321
05:24:29,840 --> 05:24:35,299
and then we'll come back and do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

3322
05:24:35,299 --> 05:24:37,639
Tomorrow, he's got something going on.

3323
05:24:37,639 --> 05:24:45,529
No, I just have to take care of something.

3324
05:24:45,529 --> 05:24:46,349
I hope you had fun.

3325
05:24:46,349 --> 05:24:48,069
I did.

3326
05:24:48,069 --> 05:24:49,610
I saw somebody say this is the worst stream of the year.

3327
05:24:49,610 --> 05:24:51,009
And I was like, ban that guy.

3328
05:24:51,130 --> 05:24:52,330
And everyone said, ban that guy.

3329
05:24:52,330 --> 05:24:56,000
And then we banned him.

3330
05:24:56,000 --> 05:24:56,840
What about Yakuza?

3331
05:24:56,840 --> 05:25:01,080
Yeah, we'll probably just open on Monday with Yakuza.

3332
05:25:01,080 --> 05:25:03,299
Cause I feel like that's a stream

3333
05:25:03,299 --> 05:25:07,279
that's going to take more than a day or two in a row.

3334
05:25:07,279 --> 05:25:09,200
And I don't want to do what I did last time,

3335
05:25:09,200 --> 05:25:10,759
which I played it for like three hours.

3336
05:25:10,759 --> 05:25:12,840
And it said, no, I'm done.

3337
05:25:12,840 --> 05:25:15,490
Never coming back to that again.

3338
05:25:15,490 --> 05:25:19,450
So I'm going to block out the time to play Yakuza

3339
05:25:19,450 --> 05:25:24,540
for at least a day or two.

3340
05:25:24,540 --> 05:25:26,619
That's not, that's going to happen again.

3341
05:25:26,619 --> 05:25:29,729
Well, that would be funny if it did.

3342
05:25:29,729 --> 05:25:33,669
You would at least be able to say that that's what happened.

3343
05:25:33,669 --> 05:25:35,669
Sly Cooper is going to, don't worry.

3344
05:25:35,669 --> 05:25:39,770
Sly Cooper is, I got to get another PS3.

3345
05:25:39,770 --> 05:25:41,709
Which, okay, let's make that decision right now.

3346
05:25:41,709 --> 05:25:43,180
Okay.

3347
05:25:43,180 --> 05:25:44,380
I'm going to put a poll in chat.

3348
05:25:44,380 --> 05:25:48,340
Yakuza zero, Yakuza seven, or Yakuza dragon.

3349
05:25:48,340 --> 05:25:53,099
Let's make that choice now.

3350
05:25:53,099 --> 05:25:54,500
Cause I've been hearing all kinds of,

3351
05:25:54,500 --> 05:25:56,060
don't play that one, play this one instead.

3352
05:25:56,060 --> 05:25:58,419
This is, no, you, you should play zero.

3353
05:25:58,419 --> 05:25:59,459
It's the probably the best one.

3354
05:25:59,459 --> 05:26:00,500
Seven's the best one.

3355
05:26:00,500 --> 05:26:01,380
Just play the new one.

3356
05:26:01,380 --> 05:26:02,220
It's fun.

3357
05:26:02,220 --> 05:26:05,430
And it's like memeable or something, right?

3358
05:26:05,430 --> 05:26:07,650
So let's just, let's get this out of the way now.

3359
05:26:07,930 --> 05:26:12,909
So we can get this ready for Monday.

3360
05:26:12,909 --> 05:26:13,750
Okay.

3361
05:26:13,750 --> 05:26:19,259
I'm going to Yakuza zero, Yakuza seven.

3362
05:26:19,259 --> 05:26:33,119
Is Yakuza seven on PlayStation four or is it on PS3?

3363
05:26:33,119 --> 05:26:33,919
It's on PC.

3364
05:26:33,919 --> 05:26:34,740
Oh wow.

3365
05:26:34,740 --> 05:26:37,610
Okay.

3366
05:26:37,610 --> 05:26:38,590
Is Yakuza zero on PC too?

3367
05:26:38,590 --> 05:26:49,279
I know I was PS4 only, wasn't it?

3368
05:26:49,279 --> 05:26:50,279
Here comes the subs for the day.

3369
05:26:50,279 --> 05:26:51,119
Thanks everybody.

3370
05:26:51,119 --> 05:26:57,139
I really appreciate it as always.

3371
05:26:57,139 --> 05:27:03,580
Thanks for the insane amount of subs.

3372
05:27:03,580 --> 05:27:07,880
End of the stream chat decides yes they do.

3373
05:27:07,880 --> 05:27:12,560
Well, this seems to be very, very, very unanimous.

3374
05:27:14,020 --> 05:27:19,590
This is like not even a contest.

3375
05:27:19,590 --> 05:27:20,630
Seven is dragon.

3376
05:27:21,470 --> 05:27:24,580
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3377
05:27:24,580 --> 05:27:25,419
Hold on.

3378
05:27:25,419 --> 05:27:26,240
New poll.

3379
05:27:26,240 --> 05:27:29,689
Wait, wait, what?

3380
05:27:29,689 --> 05:27:30,709
Yakuza seven is the...

3381
05:27:30,709 --> 05:27:31,549
All right.

3382
05:27:31,549 --> 05:27:32,389
Wait, hold on, hold on.

3383
05:27:32,389 --> 05:27:33,990
People might've been confused.

3384
05:27:33,990 --> 05:27:34,830
I could do new poll.

3385
05:27:34,830 --> 05:27:35,650
New poll.

3386
05:27:35,650 --> 05:27:40,159
Wait, just forget that one.

3387
05:27:40,159 --> 05:27:41,360
People might've been like, I don't understand.

3388
05:27:41,360 --> 05:27:43,560
I'm going to just, just stop, stop it.

3389
05:27:43,560 --> 05:27:50,500
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3390
05:27:50,500 --> 05:27:54,610
Is it zero or Yakuza seven?

3391
05:27:54,610 --> 05:27:55,450
Okay.

3392
05:27:55,450 --> 05:27:58,919
That's way easier.

3393
05:27:58,919 --> 05:28:01,819
Click this one instead.

3394
05:28:01,819 --> 05:28:10,799
Vote on that one.

3395
05:28:10,799 --> 05:28:15,799
And still that didn't really matter, did it?

3396
05:28:15,799 --> 05:28:24,380
By a astronomical amount.

3397
05:28:24,380 --> 05:28:25,220
All right.

3398
05:28:25,220 --> 05:28:28,779
So I streamed Yakuza zero already.

3399
05:28:28,779 --> 05:28:29,619
Should I just,

3400
05:28:29,619 --> 05:28:31,259
should we just pretend that stream didn't happen

3401
05:28:31,259 --> 05:28:34,139
and just start to just do it over the whole thing?

3402
05:28:34,139 --> 05:28:36,400
What if I make the same jokes?

3403
05:28:36,400 --> 05:28:38,279
What if I like make the same references?

3404
05:28:38,279 --> 05:28:39,880
Can we just pretend like I didn't?

3405
05:28:39,880 --> 05:28:42,939
I probably will.

3406
05:28:42,939 --> 05:28:49,119
What if I make the same terrible jokes?

3407
05:28:49,119 --> 05:28:50,159
Nobody will remember.

3408
05:28:50,159 --> 05:29:00,060
It was kind of a long time ago, wasn't it?

3409
05:29:00,060 --> 05:29:00,880
All right.

3410
05:29:00,880 --> 05:29:01,720
This is, this is pretty clear.

3411
05:29:01,720 --> 05:29:02,560
Yeah.

3412
05:29:02,560 --> 05:29:06,779
So we'll just start Yakuza zero.

3413
05:29:06,779 --> 05:29:08,819
And I will actually give it the time that it deserves.

3414
05:29:09,819 --> 05:29:11,610
Because remember that's,

3415
05:29:11,610 --> 05:29:13,930
even after doing this kind of pulling back

3416
05:29:13,930 --> 05:29:16,299
on streaming recently,

3417
05:29:16,299 --> 05:29:17,299
four or five years ago,

3418
05:29:17,299 --> 05:29:19,740
I only streamed for three hours a stream.

3419
05:29:19,740 --> 05:29:22,299
Sometimes four.

3420
05:29:22,299 --> 05:29:31,799
So I only gave that game like three hours.

3421
05:29:31,799 --> 05:29:32,619
All right.

3422
05:29:32,619 --> 05:29:33,459
I'll see you guys on Monday.

3423
05:29:33,459 --> 05:29:34,279
We'll go Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

3424
05:29:34,279 --> 05:29:38,520
Yakuza zero opening on Monday.

3425
05:29:38,520 --> 05:29:40,470
I'll see you guys later.

3426
05:29:40,470 --> 05:29:41,669
Thanks for watching as always.

3427
05:29:41,669 --> 05:29:43,270
Always a pleasure.

3428
05:29:43,270 --> 05:29:44,590
Happy Thanksgiving to those of you

3429
05:29:44,590 --> 05:29:49,259
that celebrated it yesterday.

3430
05:29:49,259 --> 05:29:50,220
Thank you.

3431
05:29:50,220 --> 05:29:55,549
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3432
05:29:55,590 --> 05:29:59,549
I said, why am I saying thank you to you?

3433
05:29:59,549 --> 05:30:00,389
Happy Thanksgiving.

3434
05:30:00,389 --> 05:30:02,500
Thank you.

3435
05:30:02,500 --> 05:30:04,180
Well, I guess, I mean, I am thankful for you.

3436
05:30:04,180 --> 05:30:06,549
I am.

3437
05:30:06,549 --> 05:30:07,389
All right.

3438
05:30:07,389 --> 05:30:08,229
Let's do, let's do a raid.

3439
05:30:08,229 --> 05:30:09,049
Let's do a raid.

3440
05:30:09,049 --> 05:30:09,889
Let's go.

3441
05:30:09,889 --> 05:30:14,090
We are gonna raid.

3442
05:30:14,090 --> 05:30:18,569
Oh, I mean, if, if Mr. Sark is live,

3443
05:30:18,569 --> 05:30:20,330
they get raided.

3444
05:30:20,330 --> 05:30:23,240
That's just how it works.

3445
05:30:23,240 --> 05:30:24,479
It's playing Raft right now,

3446
05:30:24,479 --> 05:30:28,090
which tell me if it looks good.

3447
05:30:28,090 --> 05:30:29,930
Mr. Sark is hilarious.

3448
05:30:29,930 --> 05:30:32,259
Go watch him.

3449
05:30:32,259 --> 05:30:34,549
He's been around for a long time.

3450
05:30:34,549 --> 05:30:45,470
He's playing Raft.

3451
05:30:45,549 --> 05:30:48,639
The Mr. Sark.

3452
05:30:48,639 --> 05:30:49,599
And I'll see you guys soon.

3453
05:30:49,599 --> 05:30:53,869
See you Monday.

3454
05:30:53,869 --> 05:30:56,889
Take care, guys.

3455
05:30:56,889 --> 05:30:57,729
See you soon.
