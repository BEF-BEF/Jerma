1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:23,179
I actually can't even tell I'm hitting them. I guess I'm hitting them. I missed.

2
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:33,700
This is hard to do. Is there like an aim down sights? Who's saying that? No, that's me saying

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:47,740
that. Am I out of bullets? What's going on here? Something going on in the saloon? Everybody calm

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,700
down for a second. Let me get in there. I'm the sheriff around here. What's happening in this bar?

5
00:00:53,659 --> 00:01:03,859
It's a stick up. I'll take care of this. All right. Shh. Shh. Don't say anything. Barkeep.

6
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:13,250
There's no telling what this crazy maniac will do. I got him. There you go. Yeah, you're safe now.

7
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,959
Don't act like I never did anything for you. Yeah, look who I got guys. Look what I did.

8
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:33,340
I rescued the town. I rescued everybody. What do you know? Don't put them. No, shit.

9
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:49,379
Now everybody freaks out. What does he want me to do? What am I doing? Am I holding a piece of bread?

10
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:57,620
What am I supposed to do with this guy? Do I just blow love potion in his face?

11
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:02,620
You stay down here. I'm going to take care of these two punks.

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:17,650
Who the fuck was that? Who was that? Why would you run out? I thought that was another bad guy.

13
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,080
You keep quiet. You keep quiet. I'm just going in here to take a look at the prisoner.

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:35,340
Fucking old man. Eat shit. Where is he? Where's that prisoner? There he is. There's that scumbag.

15
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,240
Consider it done. Consider it done. Put this motherfucker in a cell.

16
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:50,900
Got to make sure I get my story straight for when he wakes up. Sheriff, thank God you're awake.

17
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,659
Those bandits beat both of our asses and locked us in these cells. It's terrible. Sounds like trouble.

18
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:02,509
They could be east of the Mississippi right now, Sheriff. I'll help you solve this mystery,

19
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:24,379
whatever it takes. Sheriff, where's the sheriff? What? He ran out and went to the bar? This guy

20
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:33,550
was just unconscious. He woke up in a cell and that's the first thing he does. He's taking a piss

21
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:49,699
over here. Very surprised nobody can see me right now. This guy's talking to me. I just had a

22
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:55,409
conversation with that guy and he doesn't know I'm here. Be quiet. I heard something. Do I have to?

23
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,370
Be quiet. I heard something. Yeah, it was me you heard.

24
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:13,139
I'm just going to be honest. I can't even make rhyme or reason to anything that's on that mini

25
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:19,040
map. I have no idea what any of that means. I don't even know what direction I'm facing.

26
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:42,899
Snipe somebody here. Gonna find my target. What the fuck? Why would you ride the horse around to get

27
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:52,189
off on the same place you got on? He went like a total of 19 feet on that horse. I have to hit

28
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:56,670
somebody right in the head when they're on it moving erratically. Just like the ducks at the

29
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:06,139
old Midway game that go back and forth. This is going to be impossible. Here we go. God damn it.

30
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:20,290
Say cheese. I got him. Madam, I will have to ask you to follow me. Okay. What do you want?

31
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:33,740
What do you want us to do? I'm here to follow you. That's what you wanted? That's what you wanted to

32
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,750
tell me? This guy's annoying. How close can I get to these guys without them shooting me?

33
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,759
You know you can shoot at me. You don't have to keep creeping. You know you can shoot me.

34
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,000
I did. I already did this. I already did. This just happened in the last video I made. More

35
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,189
idiots that don't understand dynamite and don't care that I exist. I can't tell if this guy is

36
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:10,459
sleeping like this or if he's tied up or something, but regardless he's getting punched in the fucking

37
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:18,370
face. I'm not touching the keyboard. My hands are in the air guys. I swear to God. He's doing

38
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:32,000
this all by himself. There's nobody. Hold on a second. Hold on just one second.

39
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:46,379
Will the same thing happen if I stab him? Here we go. I'm going to stab this guy into a portal

40
00:06:46,379 --> 00:07:02,660
in an invisible wall and it's going to kill him. Well boys, looks like this is the end of the road.

41
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,180
Nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide. Unless somebody has a foolproof strategy. Speak now or forever

42
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:24,480
hold your peace. I got a strategy. All right it worked. I'll go get the horses. I think they're

43
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:38,800
tied up back. Guys you can put your hands down now. What on earth? What am I doing with this guy?

44
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:48,720
Why did we turn into a human tumbleweed? This is where I keep the person clothesline.

45
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,259
No you just, I can't trust the driver anymore. You know just you don't get a good clean dry.

46
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:00,019
Do it the old-fashioned way. That's what I say. It's almost like they're doing their best gorilla

47
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:05,339
impression. All we need are monkey noises and these guys would make sense.
