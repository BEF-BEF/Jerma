00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,460
Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with face burnt Jerma sunburned fortress 2

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,820
No, this is face game fortress 2 Monday's edition

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Playing as the demo night as you see here, but this is gonna be a very special

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,059
Demoman demo night video because it's going to be a live

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,390
Stipulation match now. What is a stipulation match? Oh, it's that it's where you're only allowed to do one

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:41,310
Very specific thing with a very weird loadout. Well, not really a weird loadout, but a weird set of guidelines and

7
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:46,850
This particular set of guidelines I'm using for this stipulation is shield only

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,920
So let's see if I can kill people with the shield in this live stipulation match

9
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,460
No

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,969
So I'm only allowed to kill people with the shield. That's it

11
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,010
If I try to use the sword I am eliminated even though I don't know why I would try to do that anyways

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,349
Unless it was on accident, but this could get very very interesting. It could be very bad, too

13
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,750
I could just totally lose this entire thing and never kill one person, but that's the beauty of stipulation

14
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,739
Splendid screen does 70% more damage. That's why I'm using it map is high tower and

15
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,829
I gotta I gotta wait till I have a little bit lower health get smashed. Oh

16
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:34,810
All right, there's one there's one I got one kill I'm happy with that

17
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:43,370
Come on who wants another who wants a shield in their face? Oh this sniper does this sniper does

18
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,180
No, no I get this guy too ready watch this

19
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,959
Come on. Give him again. Give him again. I got the assist. I got the assist

20
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:05,390
Where is he? Oh my god. That was scary. Come on. Come on. Oh

21
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,989
Scout oh you don't even know. Oh

22
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:15,710
I missed everybody. Oh my god. I'm a no man's land. Come on. Come on kill the scout kill the scout

23
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,199
Oh, no, oh

24
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:26,409
If he had had less health I would have killed him damn it

25
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:34,050
Oh, well, at least I've killed a couple people. It's not a total failure. Let's go again

26
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:42,460
And if you're wondering if you weren't at the live stream last night, you're wondering why I'm all burnt to a crisp

27
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,520
That's because I was at the beach the other day

28
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,159
And I wanted to I wanted to get some color in my face a little bit

29
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,139
Before I went to Seattle for Pax Prime and I stayed out a little too long in the Sun

30
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,400
So hopefully I'm not a peeling mess when it comes to Pax Prime and is anybody even

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,199
Nope, whatever. I'll get away

32
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,580
Hopefully I'm not appealing mess before Pax Prime is what I was going to say

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,250
I probably already said that but I just want to reiterate it again. This is actually pretty fun. This is not gonna lie

34
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,080
This is like fun. Some stipulations are really hard already watch this

35
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,300
Can I oh?

36
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,990
Man that would have been so epic if I'd hit somebody that ran around. It's alright. It's alright. I got my charge back

37
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:36,020
Who wants a shield planted in their skull? Oh this pyro does what is this guy doing?

38
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:46,090
Come on one more time one more time. He doesn't even know he doesn't even know he doesn't even know

39
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,780
Come on turn around. Come on one more time one more time. Let me get it. Oh

40
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,280
It's alright. I'll get this by oh

41
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,460
You went which were you going spy you don't even trying to stay a stabby is that what you think you're gonna do

42
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,539
Is that what you think?

43
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,300
Come on why don't you stay a stabby come on? What how did that not connect? I am gonna get this spy

44
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:27,100
I am gonna get him don't he's gonna he's trying to stay a stabby. That's this is his plan. No. He's gone damn it

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,689
He's gone. No. He's right there. He's right there. Oh, I could have had him right there. I had the chance

46
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,850
Where is he dead? Did I get him? I don't think I got him

47
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:48,339
I don't even know if he'd done wait. Why did it make the noise? It made like the run into you noise

48
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:55,230
All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go got like a 19 second respawn. Holy Toledo

49
00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:01,790
It started out pretty well. I killed like two or three people in the beginning there

50
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,209
live stipulation

51
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:17,300
Dot-com dot edu dot org. Oh, no, the bomb is almost reached a final terminal. All right, we got here. No

52
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Oh, I just clicked good thing that was not a kill because otherwise I would have been eliminated

53
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:30,189
And it by eliminated. I mean just I just I swing and I lose and here we go

54
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:37,220

00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:45,250
Come on. That was she was so toast. He was so dead. I'll get him again

56
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,870
He's gonna come around the corner and I'm going to smash him and he's gonna die

57
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:58,459
Come on before he gets the century up. Oh, he the soldier got him soldier got him. I think you are a spy

60
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:15,459
How did he not die? Why didn't I run into him? I can't believe you didn't die from that. Oh

61
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:21,860

77
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,720
So I feel like I can kill one person again. Here we go. Oh too many people over there
