1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:34,149
Oh hello. How are you? How's it going? Do you have peanut butter voice? Yeah, a little.

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:55,299
Better? Yeah, I'm a little early. I'm a day early. But I just felt like turning it on.

3
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:10,250
That's what we're doing. Day five of wisdom teeth recovery. Oh shit. It usually takes a while.

4
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:31,689
Usually like a week or two, right? He's obsessed with being early. Cozy eye strain? What? Yeah,

5
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:38,870
today we're going to play. It's been on the list for a little while called travelers rest.

6
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:50,709
So it reminds me of. Oh, there's an eye strain tag. There's an eye strain tag.

7
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:59,989
Why would you want to look that up as a tag? Oh yeah, I'm going to search for some streams

8
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,950
that I think are. Yeah, I'm on I'm on Twitch. Let me look for some streams.

9
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:10,330
Uh, I strain that seems like a like a tag you wouldn't want to go look for.

10
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,099
It's for warnings. Oh, because because right now it says English and I strain.

11
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:24,860
Those are the only two tags. That's funny. To be honest, that's how I found you.

12
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:37,750
Do I take game suggestions? Yes, there's a recommended channel in the discord channel

13
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,810
is just open to the public. So if you have a game that that I have not already played,

14
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:55,560
then by all means put it up there. Definitely make sure to search in that channel. Make sure

15
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,879
that it's not the same thing that's been posted a few times, but I do. I go in there frequently.

16
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,099
I mean, by frequently, I mean at least at least a couple of times a month. I'll just kind of open

17
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,060
it. It's funny. I use the recommended channel in my discord more than any other channel in the

18
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:18,539
discord. It's like one of the only uses that I have for that discord for me personally is.

19
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:24,280
What's in the recommended? Let's go look for a little bit. At least once a year, yeah.

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,840
But what I usually do is I just kind of start from the most recent one and just go up.

21
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:42,900
Just take a look. See, I usually go up as long as it's been since I was there last time.

22
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:51,099
From what I remember, at least. Rude streamer doesn't engage with his audience.

23
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:12,360
OK, yeah, true, true, true. Insane streamer puts boundaries on how he feels. Yeah.

24
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:24,149
I think that's important, though. I think that's very important.

25
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:28,410
Ah, he's strained. How am I doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good.

26
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:39,209
It's been kind of a wild few days. Very exciting stuff. Kind of overwhelming and in a lot of ways.

27
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:49,800
But it's been, it's been, it's been great. I also, no tannins? No, no, no tannins tonight.

28
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:57,990
It's not that I have heard. Yeah, I, there is another little thing I want to talk about

29
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,629
with Battle Beasts. There's no, I promised no PowerPoint presentation tonight.

30
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:13,000
So, but like the four or five sentences that I want to say. No, no PowerPoint. Sorry. I know.

31
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,660
When is Breath of the Wild? I know. I don't know. I don't know. I need to like, I just have to play

32
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,220
it. Like, I don't know. I want to play this. There's like all the stuff I just want to play.

33
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,920
You know what's weird about Breath of the Wild? I'm going to be honest. Let's, let's, OK,

34
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm going to completely just give you the total transparency. This happens to me a lot. It

35
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:53,660
probably happens to a lot of people here. A lot of times I will get 30, 40, 50, 60 percent of the

36
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:01,220
way through a game and then not play it for a little while. And then going back is almost like

37
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,339
shit. It's almost like I walked out of the theater in the middle of the movie

38
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,870
and going back to watch that whole movie again at some point, right? Oh yeah. OK,

39
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,589
I'm going to go back and I'm going to watch. OK, I'm going to watch Infinity War. I walked out in

40
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,310
the middle of that movie, but I mean, I'm going to give it a chance. And you kind of sit through

41
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,220
the beginning again. You're like, I don't know. Who is this guy? Who is this? It's been like a

42
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,459
year since I looked at it. I cared about this. Who is that? This Thor? Oh yeah. I fuck. I don't

43
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,230
think maybe I just won't even watch this movie. So that happens. That does happen to me all the time.

44
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:45,850
So I can't tell you that it's not that I don't want to. It's not that I don't want to play

45
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:54,379
Breath of the Wild. It's I kind of walked out of the theater halfway through, got really busy.

46
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,779
I think that was during the period, too, where I was didn't stream very much, right?

47
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:06,540
But yeah, I will probably finish it. I will. I just need to find the reason to kind of

48
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:26,199
put the DVD back in. So don't worry. Don't worry. Probably. Can you talk about Brado Beast's

49
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,540
digital version? That's one of the things I want to talk about today.

50
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,060
I want to make sure I don't say anything incorrect, but.

51
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:57,290
Uh oh. Hold on a second, everybody. Hold on a second, everybody. I don't want everyone

52
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,660
to freak out right now because I just said the word digital. This is not turning into

53
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,459
an NFT project. This is not going to be like, just hold on a second. Let me just talk.

54
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,399
Let me talk. The movie just started. The movie just started. You can't. I'm sorry,

55
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,439
we're going to use the movie analogy here. I'm sorry. Thanos just appeared on screen

56
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,019
and he has like the reality stone in his hands and none of the first fucking 10 minutes of

57
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:31,939
Infinity War. Isn't he just like, oh, I need to collect six more of these and go my minions.

58
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,179
But if in the first five minutes of that movie, you're screaming at the screen going,

59
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,580
I can't. Why did you? No, you're going to, you're going to kill Thor with that thing.

60
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,740
You're going to, you're going to kill Thor with that. And it's like, bro, the movie's still going.

61
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:53,289
Like we don't even know. Stop, sit down. Relax. He's got the reality stone. He's going to kill

62
00:08:53,289 --> 00:09:01,019
Thor. It's like, no, dude. Hey, just, hey, shut up, man. I'm trying to watch. And then you get

63
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,179
halfway through the movie and whatever, you know, it's the, I don't want to give infinity

64
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,580
war spoilers is I don't know why that's the one movie that I've refused to fucking spoil.

65
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,320
Why? Why? Forever. And this has been for years, for years,

66
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:26,230
since the first green screen stream back in like what? 2019, 2018. Oh, I don't want to,

67
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:32,970
I don't want to spoil infinity war. Why is that the movie that I don't want to spoil?

68
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,059
That that's the one. And even now, like five, four, five, six years later. Well,

69
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,500
I don't want to talk about infinity war because I don't want to like spoil it for anybody. It's like,

70
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:54,649
dude, it's all right, man. I think it's going to be OK. But anyways, I want to meaningfully talk

71
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,330
about this. And I think there's enough people here now that I don't know. There's nothing to announce,

72
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:07,509
but so for the game grotto beast, the game grotto beast, because at the very beginning,

73
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,549
the very beginning of this project, this project was community merch and it was like, wait,

74
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:16,309
we can build a game on top of it. That's kind of cool. We can have there be rarities. That's

75
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:22,470
kind of cool. But I want to make sure that people understand that we are actively exploring other

76
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:29,559
stuff to make it so people can participate, because we're not obviously it's not like,

77
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:38,070
oh, yeah. Can I get every single card, every single grotto beast card? I don't I don't know.

78
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,419
Right. And I think the idea is people that really want to just play the game,

79
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,100
the game portion of this merch, because that's what it is. The actual card game,

80
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:55,220
we want to make sure that there is a version that people can just play. And whatever that means,

81
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,509
we're exploring it right now. But the one thing that we're trying to figure out and one thing

82
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:07,029
that we know is probably not going to be in the game or whatever version of whatever this is.

83
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,519
And when I say game, like the game portion of what we're trying to digitize, is this a mod

84
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:20,340
of an existing platform? Is this a standalone app that you just get or buy whatever? I don't know.

85
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:29,899
But it's it was absolutely not nothing in these discussions have been a digital digital card

86
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,940
packs. No, this would be something that we can just make sure that everybody has access to play

87
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:43,429
it if they wanted to. But that's not what's happening. This is not a case of we're just

88
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,149
taking the physical thing and making it digital to like sell digital card packs.

89
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:56,389
That's not what this is. That's not what I'm telling you. So it would be the version,

90
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:04,220
the thing that we have right now, these 200 cards would just be the thing that you have.

91
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:11,500
And whether that's a mod or whether that's a small kind of small digital version that we can make,

92
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,139
that's what we want to do. No, with no in app purchases. This wouldn't be an app

93
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:23,269
purchase wouldn't be anything like that. But also to we want to just we want to make it

94
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:31,299
don't make sense. And that's meaningful. And there's plenty of ideas that have floated around.

95
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:36,899
But the ideas we want people to participate in the game portion of this merch, even if they,

96
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:44,870
you know, let's say you don't buy like a bunch of card packs, we want people to be able to

97
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:55,850
experience this event for the community. However, that is that we're still trying to

98
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:11,620
figure that out. And if it's not, I'm telling you, no, that's not what it is. And also,

99
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,850
this is an interesting kind of thing to talk about, too, is if we do have a version of the game that's

100
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,899
on that's a that's a mod, or that's a standalone thing, whatever, then our game designer can

101
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,320
continue to be kind of in control of that game portion. Right. So that's very interesting. That

102
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:40,980
means that there's things that can happen to that version can be maybe and I'm speaking

103
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,179
completely candidly right now. This is not anything that I'm planning. And this is not

104
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:49,299
something we have planned. But maybe the game designer can make balance changes possible.

105
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:58,200
I don't know. That's possible. But the game portion of this merch product, something that

106
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,480
we're trying to figure out how to let anybody really participate and not need to be in the same

107
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,389
room meaningfully and have it make sense. It's a long process. We're really trying to figure it out.

108
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,399
But trust me when I say we are trying to make it so as many people can enjoy this event

109
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:30,169
as we can. That's all I can really say. Game designer is sweating right now. Is it going to

110
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:43,289
be a Minecraft mod? Well, we definitely we want it to be easy. We want it to be something that's

111
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:48,409
simple, that is not you can just jump in it and make it easy. We don't want to make it where,

112
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:54,009
oh yeah, and then by the way, while you're in here, you're gonna buy packs. That's not we want

113
00:14:54,009 --> 00:15:03,850
people to be this is for the game portion. It's not about anything else. Because we've seen people go

114
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:10,250
wait, like the game seems kind of there's a game. What is the game? That seems kind of interesting.

115
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,860
How does it work? The rules are being worked on right now. Well, that while the rules being

116
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,340
posted are being worked on right now. The game is completely is it's complete. I don't want to

117
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,940
say that incorrectly, because I have a tendency just to kind of be a stream of consciousness,

118
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:33,159
right? The game is the game portion is done. But the rules, we want to make sure there's a place

119
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:38,519
for people to see the rules. And what's being worked on right now is the page that we're putting

120
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:45,019
the rules on. So that'll be in the next day or two of the next couple of days. So I need to make

121
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:49,740
that really clear. Like, what the fuck, dude? What do you mean you don't know that what the rules

122
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,009
aren't done? The rules are done. They've been done for a long time. The rulebooks are printed,

123
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,620
by the way. We're not still making the rules. I just I have a tendency just to fucking talk.

124
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,620
And that was not correct. The rules are done. The rules. The rulebooks been printed. Don't worry.

125
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:16,360
Is he groggy? I mean, I showed you the rulebook already. I mean, that's bold. That's the way it

126
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:34,169
is. Yeah, that is what how we're our stance on sort of the digital aspect of this. Let us try to

127
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:47,929
get it right. I'm going to say four or five sentences. Yeah. But, you know, is this guy

128
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:58,070
going to play Traveler's Rest or not? If the game takes off, will you? I don't even I don't even want

129
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:06,920
to go that far. Right. I don't want to go that far. This was a project for this community.

130
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,019
It's a merch for this community. And that's my stance on it. And that's our stance on it.

131
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,640
I do not want to tell. I don't want to say like, oh, wow, look at this. And we're going to do this.

132
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:29,160
And we're going to do this. I can't say that. We really can't. All I can tell you is it's a really

133
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,079
it was a really, really crazy project that is finally at its completion. And we finally get

134
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:44,920
to show it and finally get to sell it. And that is the stance. And now, ladies and gentlemen,

135
00:17:44,920 --> 00:18:11,339
if you could please get comfortable, we're going to play Traveler's Rest again. No digital card

136
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:27,859
pack openings. I need to make that like one, two, three, four words. This game has been requested

137
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,500
a lot. Seems pretty comfy. Seems like it's got a lot of inspiration from a lot of cool stuff.

138
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:48,730
But what if I want to open digital card packs? Well, then you're probably going to have to do

139
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,880
that somewhere else. I don't know, man. I don't know what to tell you. All right, let's go.

140
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:19,960
New. Oh, OK, here we go. Beard or no beard. What do you think? Definitely mustache for sure.

141
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:45,670
I think I'm done. Yeah, I like that. I like that. I like these. That's perfect.

142
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,910
Give him the Nightwing shirt. Oh, wait, I can do different shirt colors.

143
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:31,319
I don't know. This looks fine. Dude, you literally just made my father. I like this.

144
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:49,779
All right. Looks good. So now you made Ron Swanson. I think it's no, this is not.

145
00:20:49,779 --> 00:21:00,220
That's not Ron Swanson. Ron Swanson. Are you talking about the guy that talks like this

146
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,940
when he's very upset about something? He's pulling a prank on people in that office.

147
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,240
Are you that that what are you talking about? I just want to make sure I know where I'm getting

148
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:20,069
the right person. Is that it? I've only seen two episodes of that show that that's right.

149
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:34,789
I did it right. All right, let's go. OK, except welcome to Traveler's Rest.

150
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:37,509
The game is in early access, which means it's still being developed based on your feedback.

151
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:43,099
If you're enjoying your time, please start leaving a review. I move the trigger is run

152
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:55,539
and then and that's decoration mode. So this is wait. So these are the ales.

153
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:06,299
Is this like this is what I have on draft? Yeah, I'm definitely put an orange juice on draft.

154
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:15,259
Would that could you do that? Could you imagine fucking orange juice like on draft?

155
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:25,500
It'd be so cool. Just like to work. Why is that weird? OK, let's go.

156
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,549
Decoration mode. You can place items like an object, move the cursor over it, get close

157
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:56,230
and press a. OK. Oh, maybe in the corner. Just initially. I don't I don't like it over here.

158
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:13,269
There you go. But the benches are facing the wrong way. Hey, wouldn't this be wrong?

159
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:20,140
Yeah. OK, there we go. Customers will also expect their table to be well lit in the evenings.

160
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:27,640
Try placing the candle on the table. Candles are consumed over the course of days,

161
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:41,099
so you'll need to replace them in the future. OK, isn't the right spot style.

162
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:53,450
Ooh, is it on the table? Yeah. Get close to the book on the bar and press a to open your stock.

163
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,220
OK, so this is book on the bar. How much money do I have?

164
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:08,470
You're going to burn this place down. Why is there only one table here?

165
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:21,079
I guess I just opened. I got here. This looks cute. It doesn't cute.

166
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,930
All right. Storing food here will add it to your bar stock while your bar isn't stocked.

167
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,890
You will serve gruel. Oh, gruel only rewards a small amount of money.

168
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:39,299
Should I serve gruel to people? OK, so storing food here. I need to store food.

169
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,819
Trends. Oh, you can see what people like. That's cool. Press down to open your tavern and serve

170
00:24:47,819 --> 00:25:03,559
some gruel. You have a quest. I don't want to serve gruel. OK, first customers to serve six

171
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:17,400
customers. All right, come on in. We have gruel. That's all we have. You want some gruel?

172
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,990
The customer has requested an item. Let's serve them with a must have had a problem with the

173
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:34,380
decoration mode being left on. All right, here you go. That's that's all they get to have.

174
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:50,180
They can't even have any beer. You want more? You want more gruel. All right. That means it must be

175
00:25:50,180 --> 00:26:02,009
pretty good. OK, close up the tavern so you can place your new items. Call last order is by

176
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:08,250
pressing down. This will prevent new customers from entering the tavern. OK, we're closing.

177
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,329
Pressing that again will force your tavern to close, but you will lose reputation.

178
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:31,559
You should wait for your customers to leave. So if I hit that a button again, I force everybody out.

179
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:43,180
What even is gruel? To me, gruel is just a kind of a catch all or slop food. What is it? Is it like

180
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,039
is it like gluten? Is it is it like grains like oatmeal? I think when I think of gruel,

181
00:26:50,039 --> 00:27:02,299
I think of oatmeal. It's grains and water. Flour boiled in water. What? Hold on. Let me look that

182
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:14,740
up. What is actually is it gruel? A thin liquid food of oatmeal or other meal boiled in milk or

183
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:21,529
water. Some type of cereal such as ground oats, wheat, rye or rice heated or boiled in water or

184
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:32,440
milk. Thinner than porridge. That doesn't even. OK, that doesn't sound bad. In my brain, gruel was

185
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,180
disgusting. Like it was like, I don't know, all kinds of weird fucking parts. We're just gross

186
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,470
shit in it. I thought it was like, I don't know. I thought it was just gross. That actually does

187
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:54,420
not sound that. That sounds like oatmeal. That sounds fine. That is gross. No, it's not. Oatmeal

188
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,990
is not gross. OK, set up a table using your new items enter decoration mode. All right, so I need

189
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:09,640
to do a new table. OK, it's like the item on your. Oh, there it is. There it is. Table.

190
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,009
It's a little table. All right, this is this is like a like a couple's table, right?

191
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:26,099
Or like a like one one person here, one person on the other side. This is like for like dinner.

192
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:55,289
Oh, it has to be over here. Why not fit? I only have one stool there. What? Hold on,

193
00:28:55,289 --> 00:29:12,339
because the tables against the wall. Yes, it is. OK, OK. Open your tavern, serve new customers,

194
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:22,230
complete more quests, get more gruel. I think it looks good so far. All right, let's go.

195
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:33,640
We're open. You go on a first date and bring them to the gruel restaurant.

196
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:44,299
What if it's the best gruel in town? One of your customers has dirtied the floor.

197
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,380
Tavern vision will highlight important objects such as dirty tables,

198
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,250
floor dirt and important customers. Clean the floor by selecting the mop and then pressing X.

199
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:12,630
What the hell? How long does it take? Don't do that. You want gruel? Who wants some gruel?

200
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:20,740
Go on, there's not enough room for all these people. What did I just get?

201
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:28,299
You now serve porridge and grog. All right, I can put grog in there.

202
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:42,200
Grog. What is grog? Why do I feel like grog is gruel with vodka poured on it?

203
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:58,230
OK, you now serve porridge. Grog. OK, and there's porridge. So I just own it.

204
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:17,079
Why near the beer tap and at the keg of grog? Wait, I can have soup on tap? Tables dirty?

205
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:42,460
Can I put whatever I want on tap? What a lovely clean tavern. Thank you. Can I make it? All right,

206
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:55,539
what do I make one? How do I drink this? A customer has requested a beer. Move next to the

207
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,380
beer tap and press and hold A to pull a beer. Then get close to the customer. Oh, I have one

208
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:26,970
right now. Is this what you want? There you go. Oh, one silver. I love that sound. Gruel, you should

209
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:43,190
go back to only serving gruel. Nobody wants that. Imagine you're doing this for meta bucks

210
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:59,779
in the metaverse. Yeah, meta bucks in the metaverse. I love meta bucks that term. Remember,

211
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:06,539
you're bad at this. Hey, what are you talking about? I've only served everybody. I've served

212
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:18,809
everybody very quickly. Very. Hold on. I got an axe. Can we get this table wiped down? Hold on.

213
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:26,230
Close your tavern and go outside to chop trees. Let me take care of that real quick.

214
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:34,200
All right, this place is fucking disgusting. Well, maybe if you didn't miss your mouth.

215
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:52,809
Hey, look, people are dumping shit everywhere. This is disgusting. It is not. Oh, I gotta close

216
00:33:52,809 --> 00:34:07,930
this place. All right, we're closed. Everybody get out. Better not rain tomorrow. And they watch

217
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:17,000
your stream in the bar. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

218
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:31,880
you. Thank you. Thank you. All right, nice. We're closed, right? Outside your tavern,

219
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,639
you find a post box to order in supplies in a delivery box. A notice board to accept order

220
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,559
quests. Hire staff and check the calendar. A well to collect water. Natural resources that

221
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:49,260
will allow you to craft new items and harvest fruits and vegetables. And add carrots to the

222
00:34:49,260 --> 00:35:05,989
grill. Here you can order items for your tavern. Select an item to add it to your basket or press

223
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:13,099
UI select game pad to add five. Three hours. OK, so we can buy this stuff.

224
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:19,130
Oh, ale yeast. I get some of this. All right, I'm going to get one of those.

225
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:25,480
I'm going to get one of these. I'm going to get two barley's. I'm going to get two barley seeds.

226
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:33,659
I'm going to get a bed. I don't have enough money. All right. OK, buy that. Oh, shit, this is

227
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:48,650
expensive. Fifty seven. What's all the bed? Seventeen. All right, buy that. What is all this?

228
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:57,349
OK, hire staff. I can't do that yet. Orders. I don't I can't do that yet. Calendar. All right,

229
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:06,150
so there's important events. That's kind of cool. I don't see any events here. All right,

230
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:14,230
so I think we're good for a little while. So didn't want me to cut down trees. How do I attack?

231
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:34,039
Does this count? Happy gruel Saturday. Where do I go to do this? OK, there we go.

232
00:36:36,469 --> 00:37:00,699
Can I replace these? How much wood should I get? Wood in the gruel. That'd be such an

233
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:23,610
unbelievably awful filler. OK, one more tree. Historically accurate filler. What?

234
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:33,739
That's not true, right? OK, you've turned your first work area, the sawmill. Build it outside

235
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:38,699
the tavern using the decoration mode like the copper sickle. They're going to clear the weeds.

236
00:37:42,630 --> 00:38:01,179
Sawmill. All right, I'm going to clear this shit. Star gruel valley. I mean, it plays pretty nice

237
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:18,150
so far. I mean, I, I really like games like Stardew. I should probably plant some trees,

238
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:34,519
though. All right, which sawmills would probably be if this is my tavern, I don't want the sawmill

239
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:41,130
to be that close. So maybe back here, like to the right. All right, sawmills going on the right.

240
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:56,619
I'm going to go right here. OK, oh, I thought that was way bigger than I thought. That's OK.

241
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:04,360
I thought this is a big building, like a big lumber mill. This is a table. OK, so it's just

242
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:12,440
a table. So I'll put it over here. I think this is fine, right? I don't want to go that far to get

243
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:32,150
this. I think right here is fine. Hey, hold on. I like the sound of the grass. It does have a good

244
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:49,849
sound, doesn't it? All right, let's put it right here. I think that's a good spot. OK, now each

245
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,570
crafter has a list of recipes these show the required ingredients, fuel, and time. Click the

246
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:01,719
recipe name to begin crafting wooden planks. So OK, I make how much of these should I make?

247
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:08,460
It's very crunchy, smooth and crunchy. Each recipe takes time to craft. Once the timer is full,

248
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:19,699
move closer and press A to collect it. It takes 10 minutes, like actual 10 minutes or in game

249
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:49,829
world 10 minutes. Oh, OK, it's just in game world. OK, what do we do with the planks? Nice. Family

250
00:40:49,829 --> 00:41:05,699
guy mobile game. Hey, whatever. I need to make one more planks. Your character is very stylish.

251
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:14,760
Character is very stylish. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Who are you? Can I talk to people

252
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:28,570
in town? All right, so now I have pickaxe. OK, they keep telling me the decoration mode needs

253
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:34,250
to be turned off. I bet you in the play testing of this game, people probably were walking around

254
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:41,989
whoever being like, why can't I play? What's happening? So they that's a good reminder to

255
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:50,420
turn it off. That would have been you. Yes, it would have been. Absolutely would have been me.

256
00:41:50,420 --> 00:42:15,940
How do I? I can't get rid of the stone. Does this grow back? Can you pass out?

257
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:30,440
I wonder. Dude, it's dude. It's not a rock tree. Yeah, but it's still here. The smelter and the

258
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,139
anvil. OK, you build a smelter, a new working area dedicated to metals will be created.

259
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:49,530
This cannot overlap any other working area to know. Well, if the if the lumber mill is going

260
00:42:49,530 --> 00:43:03,860
to be right there and the smelter needs to be right next to it, I can't get rid of this right

261
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:11,659
above it. I'll do right above it. It's going to be ugly, but I don't care. Can I actually hold on?

262
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,780
I can't clear it.

263
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:30,420
Let's put it above. It's fine. Games kind of like Battlefield 20. All right, let's put it down.

264
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:42,360
I'm thinking just right over it. We can make this look nicer later. Now what? Open fuel.

265
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:55,059
Fuel. All right, so here's this. How much should I do? Iron bar. Not enough fuel. I need 10 fuel.

266
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:10,789
Why so much fuel? That's way too much fuel. All right. Iron. OK, I can only make two iron bars.

267
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:32,789
Where the heck up? Oh, that. OK, I can do that. Put all these logs in it. Iron sheet. All right.

268
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:44,139
Copper. Smooth and slim. I'm going to make this. I don't even know what it does. I know people will

269
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:51,030
say like I'm seeing a lot of the D face and but I think this is I used to not say any bad words,

270
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:57,719
but guys, this is just that's how I talk. All right. I'm sorry that a lot of people aren't used

271
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:07,059
to that. This is how I talk and that's how it's going to be. So you might see, you know, me being

272
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:22,070
like, what the heck? It's just that's how I talk. It just doesn't feel right when you curse.

273
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:35,699
That that has so many layers on it. That comment has so many layers. It's just like, god damn.

274
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:50,090
It doesn't feel right. I'm going to make a couple of sticks. I have an anvil too.

275
00:45:52,309 --> 00:46:08,519
Oh, nice iron nails, hinges, candelabra, candle holder. I make some nails. Carpentry

276
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:23,579
is carpentry. Would you restream Stardew? Yeah, probably in a format like this where we're just

277
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:46,090
kind of hanging out. Sickle somebody walking by. Oh, we know why you're here. I can't. All right.

278
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,329
I need let me. How late is it? What time is it? It's kind of late. I'm going to bed.

279
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:00,550
I got some deliveries, didn't I? Oh, shit. I did. Cool. All right. How do I go to bed?

280
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:27,130
What? I can't put firewood in here. Cellar. Why do I have a cellar? There's a crafting room.

281
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:36,039
There's a cellar. Here's my personal inventory. All right. Fine. I'm going to bed. This is your

282
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:39,320
bedroom. Sleep in your bed to save the game. If you stay up too late, you'll pass out.

283
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:55,079
How late is too late? This is a horror game. It's five p.m. too late to take a nap. No,

284
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:02,329
it's not ever too late to take a nap. Nap should always be considered whenever you think you need

285
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:08,179
it. Right. So if if it's six or seven o'clock, maybe there's something, you know, you really

286
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:15,699
need to do. You really want to get done. I don't think it's ever too late. I think after when it

287
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:22,599
is pitch black outside, I think that's no longer a nap. I think that's you going to bed. But I think

288
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:36,900
that doesn't happen till about for me, seven to eight p.m., I think, at least. OK, don't lose

289
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:48,860
progress. OK, I did it. What about winter? I mean, you really should be trying to awake during the

290
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,349
day and sleep during the night to try its best to get your body on that schedule if you can. But

291
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:02,809
guess what? A lot of people don't have working schedules that do that. Some people start their

292
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:12,860
job at some people at six, seven, eight o'clock at night. The number one thing that you need to

293
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,280
be aware of, try to get at least you know, you really want that six day. You want six to seven

294
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,639
to eight hours. You want those. You want eight hours. You really don't want to try to get it

295
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:30,869
hard. You really want it. OK, before opening your tavern, because they're stocking up the day,

296
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:36,760
you'll need more logs for crafting in the fireplace. Is it the post box order? OK,

297
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:48,570
consider stocking up. Why do I have so many of these? Why do I have this many? I'm not going to

298
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:56,250
open this place yet. We're putting candles around. I'm going to get another table probably, right?

299
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:12,599
Another table is a good idea. Do I have enough to make another table? Oh, there's a tech tree.

300
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:30,360
How do I make a table? We're not open. I screwed it up. I'm in decoration mode. I didn't listen.

301
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:55,139
Blacksmith table, brewing coal, firewood. How do I make a table? The rocks are here. They are here.

302
00:50:55,139 --> 00:51:13,849
Oh, wow. I imagine you can probably permanently get rid of these somehow. Hey, can you please

303
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:24,170
boot up Fallout 76? I need another member for my expedition. Well, I can assure you it's not going

304
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:39,940
to be me. Let me just make sure I can assure you of that. OK, this thing really wants me to

305
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:46,230
still use the smelter for some reason. You obtained the smelter and maybe have to make something on

306
00:51:46,230 --> 00:52:15,670
the anvil. Didn't I have? I do. So let me make nails. Why the fuck not? You actually hate

307
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:31,219
Fallout 76 unsubscribed. I need fuel in this. All right. Should I make a? OK, I'm going to make

308
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:43,769
nails. I'm going to have five nails. How long does this take? A long ass time. Why are you dying on

309
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:56,489
this hill of playing Fallout 76? What do you mean? I don't want to play it. I don't want to play

310
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:09,739
Fallout 76. Isn't that just a personal preference of game that I like? You would play it. Why not?

311
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:21,349
I never was a big Fallout fan. Not really. There are two franchises that I have close to zero

312
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:30,409
experience with. One of them is Fallout and the other one is Assassin's Creed. Those are two

313
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:45,820
franchises that I have very close to zero experience with the entire franchise. Fix that.

314
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:56,820
Play it. I did play New Vegas. I played Fallout three a tiny bit. I played Fallout four a little,

315
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:04,820
but not. We're talking all of those experiences, even Fallout New Vegas. We played it for a couple

316
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:18,139
of days and then I just started spawning easy peets and it was over. That was it. I got a lot

317
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:22,780
of room up here. This so badly wants me to keep you. Why is the tutorial for the smelter still

318
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:33,829
there? OK, maybe I have to make some more stuff. But anyways, all right. How much stock do I have?

319
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:56,780
Can you spawn easy peet now? Um, no, dude. Sorry. I want to make firewood stockpile. No.

320
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:04,949
Plank stockpile. What do I wish I make? Hole stockpile. I'm just gonna serve gruel. Fuck it.

321
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:18,469
I'm sorry. Um, let's go for it. I have plenty of beer. I have plenty of the stew,

322
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:28,409
porridge or whatever. Can I put porridge on tap? No, unfortunately. Oh, I gotta plant these trays

323
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:57,289
before I keep going. It only needs a certain area. Oh, it's good. OK. All right. Well, those

324
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:13,780
will grow. It's pretty good. What about quests? Quests. Quests. That's a weird word to say.

325
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:28,710
I want everyone to just say quests out loud. Quests. It's kind of weird, isn't it? A lot of

326
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:47,699
quests. Stop saying it so much. No, but like quests. All right. It's time to open. Did I just?

327
00:56:47,699 --> 00:57:05,820
Oops. All right. We're open. Come on in. What can I do for you? Gruel? You got it. I need more

328
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:25,739
tables. Nope. Shit. All right. Thank God half of you only want gruel. I need employees too, don't I?

329
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:43,829
What do you want? Customers being rowdy. They're marked with a angry face. Press A next to them

330
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:56,059
to try to calm them down. Who's rowdy? Calm down. OK, OK. I'll pipe down. Do I have to throw people

331
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:15,340
out? Can there be fights in here? You should encourage it. All right. Let me. Here, just

332
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:27,480
put that there. I'm going to need to make. I have enough beer, I think, to last another few days.

333
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:34,710
Buy a table. Yeah, I think I have to make it. Can I buy the tables or do I have to make a table?

334
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:54,900
Shit. There you go. Stop cleaning the table when they're eating at it. It's weird.

335
00:58:55,989 --> 00:59:00,150
Well, would you rather be all right? Would you rather go to a restaurant and have the table be

336
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:06,780
disgusting and have someone come over and clean it? Or would you rather it just not get addressed

337
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:15,769
at all? Hey, I feel like I would want to just I would want it to be addressed.

338
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:43,159
Oh, somebody's getting somebody's getting rowdy. Calm down. When was the last time you ate gruel?

339
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:51,530
Uh, I had oatmeal not that long ago. It's not like it was ages ago.

340
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:59,059
Crash and bottom left. I didn't even see it. Thank you.

341
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:08,619
More ale? Here you go. You want some more?

342
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:22,250
You should really eat a lot of gruel. You want more? This this this shit's probably good then.

343
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:32,340
I make a I make a mean gruel. Pilk and gruel on the menu.

344
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:55,860
I mean, pretty dirty in here. No, it's not. I mean, their table over here is dirty. Yours

345
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:20,170
isn't. Yours is immaculate. Oh, calm down. Calm down. This guy's had a few. I think I'm going

346
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:46,940
to close up in a minute. I have 30 silver. I thought you wanted a beer. Oh, new items and

347
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:56,329
mechanics. I leveled up brewing and cooking tech trees. All right. We're closed, closed.

348
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:08,539
Wait, what? Wait, what? Why can I use this as a weapon? I don't know you could swing.

349
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:36,309
All right. Bye. 30 bucks. Why are you closing your bar at 4 p.m.? Because I need I need to I'm not

350
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:48,010
ready. I'm not ready. I have like a tech tree now is how you learn new recipes.

351
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:53,690
Each tech cost skill points which is earned from crafting physical nature and mental.

352
01:02:56,889 --> 01:03:13,449
Oh, God. All right. So mild ale order, pale logger, mead, mead. Oh, I need OK.

353
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:18,760
So I need to I have one point with the red crystal. I need two blue and two green.

354
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:29,349
We'll go in mead. We're doing the mead tree. Porridge to soup, roasting, sausages.

355
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:42,519
I kind of feel like I want to do sausages and mead. I think that's the tree I want to go down.

356
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:55,400
Let's just make wine and cider eventually, too. Yeah, definitely the bottom part of the tree.

357
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:06,489
No soup on tap. I don't even I don't think you can't do that.

358
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:13,139
Soup, stew. Oh, I do like a good stew, though. A nice hearty stew.

359
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,500
Well, we have to we're here anyway, so we're either going this way or that way.

360
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:32,519
All right. Sir, five bowls of porridge. Craft 10 iron nails. All right. I can probably do that soon.

361
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:53,340
I need iron. I need fuel. I need one more. OK, I need I need fuel. 15 fuel. My goodness.

362
01:04:54,300 --> 01:05:14,699
Small batch draft micro stew. I need to I need more materials. We're going.

363
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:27,980
This is a material day. Materials only. Do I have an energy meter or no?

364
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:45,579
I think it's time. Looks like it's just time. Is there a town? I think there is.

365
01:05:46,219 --> 01:06:01,690
At least it looks like it. Yeah, I think there is a meter at the bottom right.

366
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:11,219
I think that's experience. Yeah, that's that's the XP, I think.

367
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:17,210
Collect water. I need a bucket. Shit, how do I get a bucket?

368
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,510
Town, town, town, town. Don't waste time on the grass.

369
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,340
One of my favorite parts of Stardew Valley was just cutting the grass.

370
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:37,590
So I really hate to tell you that that's one of my favorite parts about this game.

371
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:46,250
Walking around and clearing a new area was part of the fun for me.

372
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:25,099
Lawn mower Larry, I think something happens to you when you hit a certain age.

373
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:30,380
Let me tell you, let me be very, very honest with you.

374
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,739
You I think you hit a certain age and then you just go like, yeah, like,

375
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:40,980
I don't know something about cutting grass. That sounds kind of awesome.

376
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:49,909
That's that's an interesting day. I don't know why. I don't know why.

377
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:58,019
I used to hate the notion of, no, I don't know, cut the grass.

378
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:01,539
I don't want to cut the grass. And now I'm just sitting there thinking like,

379
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:10,679
yeah, cutting grass, planting. I want to plant some fucking tomatoes.

380
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:24,840
Oh, you know what I think I'll do this year? Green bell peppers.

381
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:33,130
To me, that's excitement. I fucking scare.

382
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:43,140
Scarce. OK, I'm looking I can't say that because it's not true,

383
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,220
but I think it's funny to say anyway, so I'm going to say it.

384
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:50,939
I'm looking forward to this season's tomatoes that I'm going to plant

385
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:57,180
than the Elden Ring DLC. Is that fucked up?

386
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:05,020
Is that like bad? Like I'm looking forward to the sunflower harvest

387
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:10,840
more than like the next Call of Duty. Is that like weird?

388
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,840
I don't know. That seems like funny to say that.

389
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:19,260
But this is, I mean, that's arguably just completely not true.

390
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:26,760
OK, I need I did the quest, right?

391
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,460
Craft a small table using the workbench.

392
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:39,109
Ooh, where? I need a new table.

393
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:47,909
That's the workbench, right? Have I not on?

394
01:09:47,909 --> 01:09:49,590
Oh, wait a minute. What's? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

395
01:09:49,590 --> 01:10:04,300
Something has appeared in my inventory. Oh, I don't like it there better.

396
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,819
I don't like this. I need to move this.

397
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:15,960
I hate it. Oh, I hate it.

398
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,710
Give me this too much space on the right. I hate it.

399
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:31,779
Wooden jug. What is this for?

400
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:33,619
Small bench. All right, individual.

401
01:10:33,619 --> 01:10:38,890
OK, I need a I want another small table for lonely people.

402
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:42,630
An individual table. 30 cents.

403
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:48,380
I think I want to save to get the bigger one, right?

404
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,840
Two more nails. What's the quest for?

405
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:56,020
It is a small table. All right, so I need two more nails.

406
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:08,250
Damn it. Oh, I can make it.

407
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:17,050
OK, we're good. Do a gardening stream.

408
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:22,140
I mean, that's a kind of a nice idea.

409
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:28,149
Maybe let me ask you guys genuinely speaking and be honest.

410
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:29,670
I don't want people to be dishonest.

411
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:37,770
If I were to let's just say for the sake of argument,

412
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,729
have a portion like so let's say like once a week,

413
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:48,920
we check on the garden and we just kind of plant stuff.

414
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,939
That's something that you guys would actually think was kind of interesting to do

415
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:57,659
just to kind of relax and be like, hey, look, this is kind of how it looks.

416
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,779
Hey, here are the bell peppers. Here are the sunflowers.

417
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:03,619
Here's how they're doing. That'd be fun.

418
01:12:10,069 --> 01:12:13,779
Agricultural stream.

419
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:15,220
And these streams would not be long.

420
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,100
They would be just check in on the garden streams.

421
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:28,119
Oh, shit. Wait, the bar is open.

422
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,920
It's been open. Oh, no, thank God.

423
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:39,960
I was like, the bar is still open. What is this?

424
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,779
Unironically, that would be something I would look forward to.

425
01:12:48,649 --> 01:13:04,060
Huh. Maybe I'll think about doing it.

426
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,989
You know, make your bed. No.

427
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,250
I mean, I've always had this theory that I only make my bed

428
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,770
if I know that there's going to be company over it,

429
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,649
that I'm going to want a tour of your place.

430
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,050
Oh, let me give you the tour.

431
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,170
So here, you know, hey, this is where I'm living.

432
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,289
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

433
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:30,569
Oh, there's the bad areas.

434
01:13:31,529 --> 01:13:35,210
It's the it's the you're giving a tour to somebody that has not been over yet.

435
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:38,149
And they're just peeking in for a second.

436
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:39,590
Oh, wow. Wow. Interesting.

437
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,270
Okay. So that's where you sleep.

438
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:45,239
Wow. Pretty much it.

439
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:52,680
All right. I need to make my table.

440
01:13:53,319 --> 01:14:00,489
I have a cat. Where do I get a cat?

441
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:14,699
Okay. How about I like that.

442
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:27,800
I like that. I like I like this one.

443
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:38,710
A cat has wandered into your tavern.

444
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:39,829
I guess it lives here now.

445
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,550
Buy a bed and a water bowl to keep it happy.

446
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,510
Oh, well, we have to do that.

447
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,949
We have to make sure this is going to be fine.

448
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:47,909
All right. How do I do that?

449
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,300
I haven't even left my fucking house.

450
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,300
I need to go see what's in the town.

451
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,050
Do you know what I mean?

452
01:14:59,609 --> 01:15:01,289
I'm sitting here. I haven't bought anything.

453
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:10,149
I've you buy it in the mailbox.

454
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:37,909
That's true. Where is it?

455
01:15:37,989 --> 01:15:40,409
All right. Order.

456
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:43,619
Every five days, five random ingredients

457
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:46,020
will be available to order marked with a star.

458
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,779
Some ingredients can be farmed

459
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:52,260
after unlocking them in the farming tech tree.

460
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,050
Butter. Potatoes.

461
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,180
You probably make your own booze.

462
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,220
That's kind of interesting.

463
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,020
All right. I need it.

464
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,930
First of all, I need a thing for the cat.

465
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:05,960
Cat bowl. 20 silver for this.

466
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,090
20? That's all my money.

467
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:22,010
What about cat food?

468
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,010
Can I serve cat food to people?

469
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,140
I know the answer is definitely no,

470
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,500
but it's worth it.

471
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,619
It's worth the question.

472
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,479
Cat bed. Cat bed. 25.

473
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:44,279
That's all I don't have.

474
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:46,229
I can't even afford it.

475
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:47,109
Well, at the very minimum,

476
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:49,909
let's at least get the bowl, the water.

477
01:16:49,909 --> 01:17:06,810
Okay. I need to make my table.

478
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,409
Open the damn tavern and make some money.

479
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:10,250
Yeah. I'm trying to make money

480
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,609
because I'm trying to make a sec.

481
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:12,810
I need a second table.

482
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,979
That means more customers can be served.

483
01:17:14,979 --> 01:17:16,020
That means more money.

484
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:27,430
That means more ingredients.

485
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:29,859
All right. I think I have enough.

486
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:35,960
I need five more of these

487
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,520
and that'll be it.

488
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,640
And I can make the table.

489
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:45,460
That means better pizza.

490
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,140
I might be able to make better pizza.

491
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:55,670
What about benches too?

492
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:57,430
Oh, that's right. Good call.

493
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:58,659
That's true.

494
01:17:58,659 --> 01:18:04,729
It's going to take an hour and 10 minutes.

495
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:06,010
I'm not opening until I have it.

496
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:10,279
What about a stool?

497
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:16,260
I can't even make a stool.

498
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:21,819
Oh, wooden planks and iron nails.

499
01:18:21,819 --> 01:18:23,739
All right. I need more iron and more.

500
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:24,539
All right. I can do that.

501
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:38,250
Okay. I need more wooden planks.

502
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:50,810
Good. I'm not opening the store yet.

503
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:57,850
You were reincarnated as an animal

504
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:58,810
with all of your memories.

505
01:18:58,810 --> 01:19:00,010
What animal would you want to be?

506
01:19:05,369 --> 01:19:07,930
There's a couple of really interesting answers

507
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:08,489
to that question.

508
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:18,170
I would, I mean, is tortoise a weird answer?

509
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,170
Because they live to be like a hundred.

510
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:33,300
You don't want to say any kind of insect

511
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,789
because most insects live very, very short lives.

512
01:19:36,789 --> 01:19:38,460
It's like, oh yeah, I'm going to realize

513
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,819
I'm going to be I would love to reincarnate as a spider

514
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:44,220
like with all your memories

515
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:47,340
and you just, that's not long enough.

516
01:19:47,979 --> 01:19:51,239
What's an animal that lives a long time?

517
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,819
Tortoises live a long time.

518
01:19:54,819 --> 01:19:56,100
Don't elephants live a long time?

519
01:19:56,659 --> 01:20:00,119
Parrots live a long time.

520
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,520
Yep. Some birds live a long time.

521
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:09,369
That's right. One of those.

522
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:17,140
Maybe a bird, some type of bird.

523
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,859
One of those birds I can, you know,

524
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:22,979
I want to be intelligent too.

525
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:27,029
Okay. I can unlock the crafting room.

526
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:35,779
Done. You make.

527
01:20:35,779 --> 01:20:40,170
All right. So to make a bench, I need these.

528
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,619
I need fuel to do that.

529
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:47,210
I'm running out. I need more wood.

530
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:52,810
Candle holder.

531
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:56,199
I'll make one of these too. Why not?

532
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:01,479
What is this thing?

533
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:14,630
The oldest tortoise was thought to be over 430 years old.

534
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:22,250
Oh my God. What is this?

535
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,329
What if this is, this is new.

536
01:21:26,329 --> 01:21:31,619
It's to make firewood.

537
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:34,420
Ooh, now we can actually have the, yeah, that's going to be better.

538
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:41,819
My birthday on Monday. Say happy birthday to me.

539
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:43,750
Happy birthday.

540
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:52,970
I feel, I don't know if I'd want to be a turtle though, a tortoise.

541
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:56,010
I feel like I, I just need to move so fast.

542
01:21:56,649 --> 01:22:00,890
Like I'm all, I feel like moving really slow would drive me crazy.

543
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:02,979
It would definitely be a bird.

544
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:08,260
Birds can just make noises and shit and it's completely fine.

545
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,539
It's totally normal and expected.

546
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:17,029
Birds just going like, it's like, oh no, no, look, that's normal.

547
01:22:17,029 --> 01:22:17,989
That's a bird.

548
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:19,510
Like, of course that bird's doing that.

549
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:21,750
Right. I could just do that whenever I felt like it.

550
01:22:28,789 --> 01:22:31,750
Yeah. Nobody's going to be mad that I did that.

551
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,550
Like a bunch of you just got mad right now, for instance.

552
01:22:36,279 --> 01:22:38,359
For instance, some of you just got very angry with me.

553
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,640
If I was a bird, you would be like, that's normal.

554
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,239
That's a normal bird behavior.

555
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:50,500
So I don't care. Should I buy these?

556
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:54,060
No. All right. So what do I need to make this?

557
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:58,439
Okay. I have, I need two more batches of nails and then that.

558
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:02,970
I need more fucking fuel.

559
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:10,039
Two more batches of nails.

560
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:15,260
And then I need to make those wooden sticks.

561
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,180
20 of them. Okay.

562
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:28,069
Well, being a human certainly has its perks.

563
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:29,189
Wait, what is this? This is long.

564
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:31,739
Being human has its perks.

565
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:36,739
The majestic albatross offers several advantages to make it a compelling alternative.

566
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,539
For starters, albatross are incredible flyers

567
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:42,100
capable of traveling thousands of miles in a single journey.

568
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,760
Their long lifespans of up to 60 years also make them ideal for those seeking longevity.

569
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:53,079
In addition, albatrosses are known to mate for life, forming strong bonds and that endure.

570
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:56,699
Where did you get this? What is this?

571
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,380
Well, being human certainly has its perks.

572
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:02,390
The alternative of being an albatross, where did you get that?

573
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,899
I, I, I, it's alternative.

574
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,300
Oh, look what I can do.

575
01:24:19,939 --> 01:24:21,500
Small table.

576
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,939
And then I need two more batches of nails and two more batches of wooden planks.

577
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,619
You go through fuel so much. It's crazy.

578
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:33,029
I guess I can start using the coal.

579
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,699
I need more iron.

580
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:42,470
All right, coal is worth a lot. I'm going to do 100.

581
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:51,989
Okay, we're good.

582
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:53,270
Professor Oak.

583
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:55,510
That was a professor Oak ass answer.

584
01:24:55,510 --> 01:25:03,050
It's like 2 p.m. and I haven't opened the bar yet.

585
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:04,840
Well, whatever.

586
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:08,840
Professor Oak.

587
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:29,079
Albatross just got here talking about albatrosses.

588
01:25:29,079 --> 01:25:30,279
They're very goofy guys.

589
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,600
Say more things about them.

590
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,640
Albatross Andy.

591
01:25:36,779 --> 01:25:38,300
You can't, all right, hold on.

592
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:42,300
I'm not Albatross Andy for, I was reading a comment.

593
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:47,689
Play the game.

594
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:51,289
I'm, I'm, I'm, I gotta wait for this because I want to build the bench.

595
01:25:51,850 --> 01:26:15,369
The quest that I have is to have a small table and then have a bench next to it.

596
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:16,010
What about the cat?

597
01:26:16,569 --> 01:26:18,869
Cat's fine.

598
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:24,970
See, I'm going to redecorate this place.

599
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:26,250
This place sucks.

600
01:26:26,729 --> 01:26:31,420
This is a coaster.

601
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:38,649
I'm a square coaster guy myself.

602
01:26:38,649 --> 01:26:40,579
I feel like it's a little more surface area for drips.

603
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:59,060
Okay, that's good.

604
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:05,659
Here, play graveyard keeper.

605
01:27:05,659 --> 01:27:06,699
I have not.

606
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:15,670
All right, I'm going to, not going to light the fire.

607
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:17,899
Crafting room.

608
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:25,500
Unlock the crafting room for $40, 10, and 11.

609
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:30,699
No, I don't, this is my house.

610
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:33,180
Why can't I just walk in?

611
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,020
Okay, I'll get it right now.

612
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:46,140
Table's going to be done.

613
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:50,779
Okay, bench, small bench.

614
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:51,500
We're good.

615
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:59,899
In the meantime, I'm going to do this stuff.

616
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:02,729
I said, respond.

617
01:28:02,729 --> 01:28:06,140
You know, I'm just going to walk over here.

618
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,579
I can't.

619
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:16,359
Oh, there we go.

620
01:28:16,359 --> 01:28:31,050
Should do a charade stream.

621
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:34,170
No talking and chat has to guess what I'm doing.

622
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:41,829
That's not a bad idea.

623
01:28:41,829 --> 01:28:42,710
That's kind of funny.

624
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:51,189
This needs to grow back.

625
01:28:51,189 --> 01:29:00,819
Emote only for the streamer.

626
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:04,119
Speaking of Breath of the Wild,

627
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:06,600
you guys played charades with me during Breath of the Wild.

628
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:20,579
Let me just make sure.

629
01:29:20,579 --> 01:29:27,880
All right, this, there is a town.

630
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,640
All right, I'll probably get a map eventually.

631
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:32,819
This is all, look at all this.

632
01:29:32,819 --> 01:29:33,699
Should I break this?

633
01:29:33,699 --> 01:29:35,060
I'm going to smash this stuff.

634
01:29:35,859 --> 01:29:40,739
Can I, it's a dock.

635
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:45,699
Okay, it does seem to be an outside world.

636
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:57,529
Just checking.

637
01:29:57,529 --> 01:30:02,220
Why the Doritos?

638
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,779
They're referencing when I couldn't figure out

639
01:30:04,779 --> 01:30:07,670
that the Lost Woods, whatever the hell it was

640
01:30:08,630 --> 01:30:11,670
in Breath of the Wild, kind of about 45 minutes

641
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:14,149
to an hour walking in a circle and people screamed at me.

642
01:30:15,029 --> 01:30:16,229
It was very embarrassing.

643
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:23,859
And I have not played the game since, but that's not true.

644
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:35,020
All right, it's time to not open.

645
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,470
Here we go.

646
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:42,630
Now make another bench.

647
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:45,460
Shit.

648
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,979
Okay, make another bench?

649
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:49,850
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

650
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:53,590
I just need nails.

651
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:54,390
Yep, okay.

652
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:54,890
Fuel.

653
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:03,130
I'm going to make a ton of nails.

654
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:04,659
I might as well.

655
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,369
And then do I have the wood for this?

656
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:09,619
Wooden planks.

657
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:20,680
What time is it?

658
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,159
Getting late.

659
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:34,380
What's going on up here?

660
01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:40,090
Clive and Rochelle wanted to detonate the ice block

661
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:41,210
to gain access to the mine.

662
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,289
How can they dare to suggest such a thing?

663
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:48,250
I understand that Brock is furious about detonating the ice.

664
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,369
But what else can we do?

665
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,789
Chief Petra is going to kill me when she finds out.

666
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:02,140
Oh, hold on.

667
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,659
What time is bedtime?

668
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:12,649
Is horse riding in Fistful of Frags?

669
01:32:12,649 --> 01:32:14,489
We'll definitely go back to that one of these days.

670
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,369
I imagine for sure.

671
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:19,430
All right, I gotta go.

672
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,899
Is pass out time midnight in this game

673
01:32:29,899 --> 01:32:32,380
or is it one, two, three o'clock in the morning, I wonder?

674
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,520
Oh, remind me to get a bucket.

675
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:41,060
No, wait.

676
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:51,539
Come on, hurry up.

677
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:57,800
I'm going to do two benches.

678
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,920
I feel like I need it.

679
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:00,840
And then I'm going to wake up in the morning and be ready.

680
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:07,539
I do have the cat bowl.

681
01:33:07,539 --> 01:33:08,260
Let me put it down.

682
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,039
What?

683
01:33:12,039 --> 01:33:13,000
No, the cat bowl is in here.

684
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:25,739
Okay, here you go.

685
01:33:26,539 --> 01:33:33,000
How about right?

686
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,399
I want you away from customers.

687
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:36,119
You know what I mean?

688
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:37,159
No, I want you right here.

689
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:38,520
That's good.

690
01:33:39,079 --> 01:33:41,029
All right, I need water.

691
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:47,399
This is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be.

692
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:49,000
Uh, where does this go?

693
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:58,229
I need to put candles in here.

694
01:33:58,229 --> 01:34:00,600
I'm going to sneeze and I apologize in advance.

695
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:10,100
Ooh, nice.

696
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:16,470
Okay, what else?

697
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:17,829
I have that table now.

698
01:34:17,829 --> 01:34:19,909
I got two small tables.

699
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,960
This place is going to be flooded with people now.

700
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:34,710
Um, I think that's all right.

701
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:40,229
I need more benches.

702
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:46,100
Have this one.

703
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:54,329
Way more people are going to show up.

704
01:34:54,329 --> 01:35:05,880
Okay, that's good enough.

705
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:14,939
I at least want them to set it.

706
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:16,760
At least have one at each table, right?

707
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:21,979
That makes the most sense.

708
01:35:21,979 --> 01:35:24,180
All right, we are closed.

709
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:24,819
Good night.

710
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:29,430
Getting up in the morning.

711
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:33,800
First thing I'm doing is opening.

712
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:40,069
Can you explain how this game is any different than Doom Eternal?

713
01:35:40,789 --> 01:35:41,670
Yeah, sure.

714
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:45,109
Good.

715
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:49,260
It's not in this game.

716
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:51,180
It is in the other one.

717
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:57,460
It's a pretty major difference.

718
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,310
Okay, I'm we're working today.

719
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,670
I'm opening the store.

720
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:25,430
We're open.

721
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:26,149
Oh, shit.

722
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:27,029
Hold on.

723
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:30,260
I was supposed to close it immediately.

724
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:35,529
I got to throw all this bullshit in my inventory.

725
01:36:35,529 --> 01:36:37,369
Oh, I can't place it when it's open.

726
01:36:37,369 --> 01:36:37,609
All right.

727
01:36:37,609 --> 01:36:38,090
Well, whatever.

728
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,689
I'm just going to I'm ready.

729
01:36:39,689 --> 01:36:40,779
Is there enough beer?

730
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:42,949
We always get girl.

731
01:36:42,949 --> 01:36:43,909
It's fine.

732
01:36:43,909 --> 01:36:52,869
I need employees.

733
01:36:52,869 --> 01:36:55,510
This place is going to this place is going to get trashed really soon.

734
01:36:55,989 --> 01:37:20,439
That's just okay.

735
01:37:20,439 --> 01:37:24,729
Somebody's pissed.

736
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:28,220
Why are you so pissed off?

737
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:28,539
What?

738
01:37:28,539 --> 01:37:31,770
The customer has become a nuisance.

739
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:34,470
They will annoy everyone around them.

740
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:39,369
Hit them with your mop to kick them out of your tavern.

741
01:37:39,369 --> 01:37:40,090
Are you serious?

742
01:37:43,779 --> 01:37:45,380
That's so fucked up.

743
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,380
That is already just getting beat with a mop

744
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:55,460
in the middle of your enjoyable gruel luncheon.

745
01:37:55,460 --> 01:38:04,600
Let me take care of that quickly for you.

746
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:09,670
Yeah, this is a dirty mop, too.

747
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,789
This is not a clean mop.

748
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:13,720
You know what?

749
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:20,250
This would not hurt as much as it would be a total imagine.

750
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:30,819
Get imagine a wet mop like all the little pieces of mop would just kind of mold around

751
01:38:30,819 --> 01:38:32,340
your face and around your head.

752
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,619
It would be fucking awful.

753
01:38:33,619 --> 01:38:35,300
It would be terrible.

754
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,100
And it would spray everywhere.

755
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,979
Wouldn't it just water splash everywhere?

756
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:47,779
It would be terrible.

757
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:56,949
We're making money.

758
01:38:56,949 --> 01:39:06,939
I'm so glad that we're mostly you just.

759
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:07,180
All right.

760
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:07,899
You just took that.

761
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:10,619
You bought that gruel and threw it on the ground.

762
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,899
You should definitely clean.

763
01:39:13,899 --> 01:39:14,699
You should clean that up.

764
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:16,899
I just handed it to you.

765
01:39:17,539 --> 01:39:27,399
Oh, oh, it's funny.

766
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:28,439
You grow the car out.

767
01:39:29,079 --> 01:39:30,439
It's always served.

768
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:41,449
Nobody wants any beer from the tavern.

769
01:39:41,449 --> 01:39:42,409
They just want.

770
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:43,050
Oh, there we go.

771
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,060
Why I beer is what makes this.

772
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:50,779
I want more of that.

773
01:39:50,779 --> 01:40:04,420
Come on.

774
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,619
Warm food and a cold drink.

775
01:40:05,619 --> 01:40:07,060
This place has made my day.

776
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,699
It makes me happy.

777
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:12,649
Here, give us a good review.

778
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:17,750
Just leave out of the review.

779
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,430
And I hit that guy in the face with a web mop.

780
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:39,720
We don't need you don't need to write that part running back and forth.

781
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,119
I must know how you clean this place.

782
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:46,039
I want to speak to the barkeep.

783
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:49,130
Oh, what's wrong?

784
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:53,159
Wait, what's he doing?

785
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,359
What was he supposed to do?

786
01:40:56,359 --> 01:40:57,880
That guy, he just he went behind.

787
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,520
That guy was like menacingly going to like hurt that guy.

788
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:01,640
Why did he do that?

789
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:07,800
He was trying to start a fight with that guy.

790
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:11,609
Why I always wanted to see what happened.

791
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:18,420
He went to a random party at the bar and just started like trouble.

792
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:23,829
I want to speak to the bartender.

793
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:25,029
Just kidding.

794
01:41:25,029 --> 01:41:26,550
I want to punch this old guy.

795
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:36,760
Yeah, I'm not closing.

796
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,850
We need to make at least 50.

797
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:56,060
You beat a paying customer.

798
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:04,859
I'm sorry, but I don't care how much how much money you're spending in here.

799
01:42:05,659 --> 01:42:08,789
You're not going to you're not going to fuck with the other patrons.

800
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:09,829
Sorry, that's not how it works.

801
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:16,569
You need to close and find your cat.

802
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:23,659
Where's the cat?

803
01:42:23,659 --> 01:42:28,680
This place is bollocks.

804
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:33,050
Okay.

805
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:33,609
All right.

806
01:42:33,609 --> 01:42:34,090
I'm sorry.

807
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:34,810
I'll be quiet.

808
01:42:36,409 --> 01:42:37,369
Hey, barkeep.

809
01:42:37,369 --> 01:42:38,569
This place sucks.

810
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:40,659
Hey, come on.

811
01:42:40,659 --> 01:42:41,939
You know, I'm sorry about that.

812
01:42:41,939 --> 01:42:42,340
You're right.

813
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:42,739
I'm sorry.

814
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:45,140
I probably should have been a little more courteous.

815
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:58,710
Is there no beer left?

816
01:42:59,829 --> 01:43:00,069
Stop.

817
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:12,810
Nobody's even order.

818
01:43:12,810 --> 01:43:20,060
Why are they all getting so there's no alcohol being served?

819
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:21,420
It's they get there.

820
01:43:22,569 --> 01:43:26,250
Oh, you know, this person drank like too much beer and now they're like

821
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,810
drunken and being rowdy.

822
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,729
No, they're eating gruel only.

823
01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:39,539
They're not why I had a little too much gruel and I'm fucking mad.

824
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,039
It's fermented gruel.

825
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,619
Is there no beer?

826
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:49,380
Oh my goodness.

827
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:50,899
That's what's going on.

828
01:44:03,539 --> 01:44:04,420
Where's the cat?

829
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:05,060
I don't know.

830
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,340
I don't know where the cat went.

831
01:44:06,899 --> 01:44:16,739
What time is it?

832
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,579
What time is it?

833
01:44:18,579 --> 01:44:20,899
Is it two or three o'clock in the morning?

834
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,140
What day is it?

835
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:24,500
I don't know what time it is.

836
01:44:27,399 --> 01:44:28,359
It's 2 p.m.

837
01:44:28,359 --> 01:44:29,800
Why do I feel like it's 2 a.m.

838
01:44:30,359 --> 01:44:42,520
Upper left.

839
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:43,159
Yeah.

840
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:43,399
Yeah.

841
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,590
All right.

842
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:49,270
Everybody get out of here.

843
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:50,229
I got to find my cat.

844
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:54,060
Oh, wait.

845
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,649
Oh, your tavern has become cold.

846
01:44:59,369 --> 01:45:07,500
It wasn't cold before.

847
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:16,710
Way too hot in here.

848
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,510
Wait, what?

849
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:18,789
What do you mean?

850
01:45:18,789 --> 01:45:20,390
It's way too hot in here.

851
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:26,659
It just told me to do that.

852
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:28,180
You're smoking everybody out.

853
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:33,050
But why is it too hot?

854
01:45:33,609 --> 01:45:34,810
It just said it was too cold.

855
01:45:39,909 --> 01:45:40,869
Turn the fire off.

856
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:44,180
No, I like it like this.

857
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:47,859
Okay.

858
01:45:47,859 --> 01:45:49,060
Fifty three bucks.

859
01:45:49,060 --> 01:46:03,770
Unlock the crafting room.

860
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:08,489
Your tavern is cold.

861
01:46:08,489 --> 01:46:09,449
This is your crafting room.

862
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:10,489
Let's make some porridge.

863
01:46:15,699 --> 01:46:17,380
I have so much porridge already.

864
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:21,109
Bucket with water.

865
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:27,130
Okay.

866
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:29,350
So I just need a bucket of water?

867
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:31,850
That sounds awful.

868
01:46:34,409 --> 01:46:35,369
Extra ingredients.

869
01:46:35,369 --> 01:46:37,210
Some recipes have mandatory modifiers.

870
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:39,640
Porridge requires a grain.

871
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,810
Barley porridge.

872
01:46:49,899 --> 01:46:50,939
I want seeds in it.

873
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:52,859
I just put seeds in this.

874
01:46:57,939 --> 01:47:00,140
Where's the cat?

875
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:01,979
Cat's right here.

876
01:47:02,619 --> 01:47:07,750
There it is.

877
01:47:08,310 --> 01:47:18,520
Cat's fine.

878
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,079
Porridge.

879
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:20,760
Now let's brew some beer.

880
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,520
Need a malting machine?

881
01:47:24,279 --> 01:47:26,439
Start crafting malted barley.

882
01:47:27,159 --> 01:47:39,859
So malted barley.

883
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:41,220
So I need barley and water.

884
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:42,979
I need fuel in here.

885
01:47:46,489 --> 01:47:47,609
Malting takes a while.

886
01:47:48,329 --> 01:47:50,729
You can reopen your tavern and serve porridge while you wait.

887
01:47:51,289 --> 01:47:54,569
Have I not even had porridge an option?

888
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:05,060
Porridge has not even been a food option.

889
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:08,539
I was wondering why we're only serving gruel.

890
01:48:19,819 --> 01:48:21,020
I don't have any cat food.

891
01:48:21,020 --> 01:48:21,659
The cat's fine.

892
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:23,260
The cat's got water.

893
01:48:24,199 --> 01:48:25,560
I need to get a cat bed eventually.

894
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,149
All right.

895
01:48:30,149 --> 01:48:31,350
I'm going to open this door again.

896
01:48:31,909 --> 01:48:33,109
This time I got more options.

897
01:48:35,829 --> 01:48:35,989
Yeah.

898
01:48:35,989 --> 01:48:36,949
I got plenty of porridge.

899
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,220
I got plenty of beer.

900
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:39,619
Let's go.

901
01:48:49,449 --> 01:48:49,930
Porridge.

902
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,520
Oh, I do have porridge.

903
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,239
There we go.

904
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:54,520
Finally.

905
01:48:59,029 --> 01:49:00,869
This is making way more money.

906
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:13,829
I was going to say, why am I serving gruel?

907
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,880
Five bowls of porridge.

908
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:22,439
I got a rug.

909
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:37,670
I'm already making way more money.

910
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:45,689
What's wrong?

911
01:49:45,689 --> 01:49:48,060
Calm down.

912
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:55,260
All right.

913
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,130
I'm just making four.

914
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:58,569
Can I put them on the bar?

915
01:49:58,569 --> 01:50:03,989
They don't go bad, right?

916
01:50:03,989 --> 01:50:10,390
Do they go bad?

917
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:20,279
They do go bad.

918
01:50:20,279 --> 01:50:20,600
Okay.

919
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:35,619
So I can't just pre-pour a dozen of them.

920
01:50:35,619 --> 01:50:36,420
You can pre-pour.

921
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:41,539
Nothing will expire.

922
01:50:41,539 --> 01:50:50,649
Actually kind of seems like that.

923
01:50:50,649 --> 01:50:50,890
All right.

924
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:52,010
I'm going to do it all though.

925
01:50:52,010 --> 01:51:03,159
Somebody just said, I love spreading misinformation.

926
01:51:04,039 --> 01:51:09,819
Well, stop.

927
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:17,000
Don't do that.

928
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:17,800
Get out of here.

929
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,739
It's too dark in here.

930
01:51:20,739 --> 01:51:22,569
It's dark in here.

931
01:51:22,569 --> 01:51:23,930
Is it really that dark?

932
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:29,239
I guess there's one source of light.

933
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:38,229
All right.

934
01:51:38,229 --> 01:51:40,489
I'm going to close pretty soon here.

935
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,020
Here.

936
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,239
Here, here, here.

937
01:51:47,239 --> 01:51:48,279
I got it, I got it, I got it.

938
01:51:48,279 --> 01:51:48,840
I already got it.

939
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:49,479
I'm doing it.

940
01:51:49,479 --> 01:51:52,520
Look.

941
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:58,579
Better.

942
01:51:58,579 --> 01:51:59,619
It's cold in here.

943
01:51:59,619 --> 01:52:05,180
Everybody good?

944
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:08,779
Everybody's good.

945
01:52:08,779 --> 01:52:19,539
46 bucks.

946
01:52:19,539 --> 01:52:38,069
How many more of these do I have?

947
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:39,699
I got plenty.

948
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:40,420
I got plenty.

949
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,329
I'm also going to beer.

950
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:47,819
All right.

951
01:52:47,819 --> 01:52:49,500
I'm officially out of alcohol.

952
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,439
All right.

953
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:56,380
I got to close.

954
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:02,680
I'm done.

955
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:04,520
Do I have to hit everybody or will they?

956
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,279
Because when they stand up like that, it goes.

957
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:10,140
It usually means somebody's about to get in a fight.

958
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:10,460
Hey.

959
01:53:11,449 --> 01:53:12,090
Hey.

960
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:13,770
What's with all the bad reviews?

961
01:53:15,909 --> 01:53:16,789
Bad reviews?

962
01:53:16,789 --> 01:53:17,270
For what?

963
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:23,699
What did I do so bad?

964
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:24,420
Hey.

965
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:26,819
Be lucky we ain't selling gruel anymore.

966
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:41,779
I got better reviews when people were eating slop.

967
01:53:41,779 --> 01:53:43,060
Bring the gruel back.

968
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,260
It was way better.

969
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:44,659
Yeah.

970
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:46,579
I made a nice stew and people say gross.

971
01:53:46,579 --> 01:53:47,300
This stew sucks.

972
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,140
Bring the gruel back, bro.

973
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:54,949
Okay.

974
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:58,260
Create wort by boiling grains.

975
01:53:58,260 --> 01:54:02,300
Place the mash ton and create some mild wort.

976
01:54:02,859 --> 01:54:05,750
Check back later when it's finished.

977
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:16,569
Oh, my goodness.

978
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:25,930
Cool.

979
01:54:25,930 --> 01:54:27,689
Why mild wort?

980
01:54:27,689 --> 01:54:31,210
Some malted barley, bitter hops, and three buckets of water.

981
01:54:31,210 --> 01:54:43,539
I need more coal.

982
01:54:43,539 --> 01:54:44,340
All right.

983
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:46,310
I need more beer.

984
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,630
I'm out.

985
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,270
I'm almost out of beer.

986
01:55:00,869 --> 01:55:01,590
You fell off.

987
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,109
Plus ratio plus gruel.

988
01:55:03,670 --> 01:55:07,210
All right.

989
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:07,850
What else do I got?

990
01:55:08,409 --> 01:55:10,840
Another candle holder.

991
01:55:11,479 --> 01:55:15,930
What is this?

992
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:16,810
Empty keg.

993
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:20,149
Oh, I guess I can fill it.

994
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:23,560
I don't know what to do with that, really.

995
01:55:24,199 --> 01:55:32,869
Okay.

996
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:42,890
All right.

997
01:55:42,890 --> 01:55:43,770
So I got to make.

998
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,949
How long does it take?

999
01:55:46,949 --> 01:55:48,310
Takes a pretty long time.

1000
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:54,659
I can make some more barley.

1001
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:55,460
I mean, I can make some more.

1002
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:57,300
Yeah, I'll make some more stew.

1003
01:55:57,859 --> 01:56:01,050
Yeah, I'll just make everything.

1004
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:06,460
All right.

1005
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:07,260
Time for bed.

1006
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,180
Tomorrow's a resource day.

1007
01:56:10,180 --> 01:56:25,500
Speaking of resources, I should keep that out.

1008
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:41,500
I guess I'm not stressing for space at the moment, so I'll be fine.

1009
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,060
All right.

1010
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:42,619
Bed time.

1011
01:56:42,619 --> 01:56:45,979
What do I think of the game so far?

1012
01:56:46,949 --> 01:56:49,539
I think it's fun.

1013
01:56:49,539 --> 01:56:50,420
It's pretty cozy.

1014
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:58,310
Let me restock this.

1015
01:56:58,310 --> 01:57:04,119
Okay.

1016
01:57:04,119 --> 01:57:04,439
Yeah.

1017
01:57:04,439 --> 01:57:05,079
So now I don't.

1018
01:57:05,079 --> 01:57:06,039
What about trends?

1019
01:57:06,039 --> 01:57:07,239
Oh, I can't do that yet.

1020
01:57:07,239 --> 01:57:13,689
Remember when Jerma talked about one of his ingrown nose hairs coming out the other side?

1021
01:57:14,329 --> 01:57:18,569
Yes, it's actually kind of cold.

1022
01:57:18,569 --> 01:57:19,449
And I'll keep it going.

1023
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:26,810
Yeah.

1024
01:57:26,810 --> 01:57:29,449
For those of you that don't know, this happened twice.

1025
01:57:29,449 --> 01:57:32,090
This is not something that happened once.

1026
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:38,789
This happened on two distinct occasions years apart from each other.

1027
01:57:44,329 --> 01:57:46,649
So yeah, I was gross or whatever.

1028
01:57:46,649 --> 01:57:49,779
I'm just going to talk about it real quick.

1029
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:55,350
So inside of one of my nostrils on the inside, not the outside.

1030
01:57:55,350 --> 01:58:02,310
One of my nose hairs, it was like it just was painful inside of my nose.

1031
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:04,069
And I don't want to skip this because I want to read this,

1032
01:58:04,069 --> 01:58:05,590
but I'm going to go quick.

1033
01:58:05,590 --> 01:58:11,340
So I had a really painful area inside my nose and I was like, what is going on?

1034
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:13,420
And it was like, ah, this hurts in here.

1035
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,500
And it was like, it's probably like an ingrown nose hair.

1036
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,350
Fuck, whatever.

1037
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:21,210
So a week goes by or so.

1038
01:58:21,210 --> 01:58:29,689
And I started getting a painful bump on the outside on the front of my nose.

1039
01:58:29,689 --> 01:58:32,819
And it was just, what is going on?

1040
01:58:32,819 --> 01:58:35,100
This hurts so bad.

1041
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:38,149
Another little bit went by and I'm telling you,

1042
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:46,970
this nose hair went through the other side of my face.

1043
01:58:46,970 --> 01:58:52,090
It ingrown haired out the other side through my whole nose.

1044
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:56,699
Crazy.

1045
01:58:56,699 --> 01:58:59,020
It was like, how was this impossible?

1046
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,329
How did you get it out?

1047
01:59:02,329 --> 01:59:04,489
Eventually it just came out.

1048
01:59:04,489 --> 01:59:15,670
I could pull it out from the front.

1049
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:22,539
It was wild.

1050
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:24,220
That's a very, oh yeah.

1051
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,260
That's so ingrown.

1052
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:26,939
It came off the other side.

1053
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:28,810
All right.

1054
01:59:28,810 --> 01:59:29,609
Oh, I skipped it.

1055
01:59:29,609 --> 01:59:31,130
I skipped it, I skipped it, I skipped it, I skipped it.

1056
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:32,010
I didn't want to.

1057
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:33,109
Oh no, it's in the corner.

1058
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:34,340
Okay.

1059
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,779
Fermentation tank.

1060
01:59:35,779 --> 01:59:40,470
I need a better spot for this stuff.

1061
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:44,180
All right, let me put this down.

1062
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,300
Let me move this out of the way.

1063
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,079
Put this in the corner.

1064
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:50,859
Put this next to the bed for all I care.

1065
01:59:50,859 --> 02:00:00,899
No, I need to put it in the order that it happens, right?

1066
02:00:00,899 --> 02:00:04,279
Okay.

1067
02:00:04,279 --> 02:00:05,640
For the last stage, fermentation.

1068
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,560
Place the fermentation tank and create some mild ale.

1069
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:12,680
You can add modifiers such as fruit and hops

1070
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,609
and give your beer a custom name.

1071
02:00:15,609 --> 02:00:22,539
Ooh, mild ale, aroma hop.

1072
02:00:22,539 --> 02:00:33,220
Wait, I'm gonna make it like berries or something.

1073
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,840
Add gruel to it.

1074
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:40,420
Yeah, can I?

1075
02:00:45,289 --> 02:00:53,020
I don't, I don't think I, no, I can't.

1076
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:58,569
But this is aroma hops and bitter hops.

1077
02:00:58,569 --> 02:01:00,250
That sounds kind of cool to me.

1078
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:08,539
All right, this is a resource day.

1079
02:01:08,539 --> 02:01:30,170
I need to collect resources and need to build some more stuff.

1080
02:01:30,170 --> 02:01:32,649
Another day without feeding the cat or giving it a bed.

1081
02:01:32,649 --> 02:01:42,260
Hold on, hold on.

1082
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:46,970
I want butter.

1083
02:01:46,970 --> 02:02:07,449
Butter, chili, gruel and honey and chili and butter.

1084
02:02:07,449 --> 02:02:09,369
Cat bed, $25.

1085
02:02:09,369 --> 02:02:10,890
This is wiping out my bank account.

1086
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:29,420
I need staff, butter.

1087
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:34,859
It takes a few hours for it to get here so I can do other stuff.

1088
02:02:34,859 --> 02:02:36,060
Right, it's a resource day.

1089
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:38,220
You guys are distracting me.

1090
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:49,850
It's a resource day.

1091
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:52,729
Ingrown nose hair grotto beast expansion, when?

1092
02:02:52,729 --> 02:03:06,760
Do you actually have to feed the cat?

1093
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:23,720
I don't think there's cat food, is there?

1094
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:26,119
Feed the cat, where do I get the cat food?

1095
02:03:53,819 --> 02:03:55,260
I'll do it, just wait.

1096
02:03:55,260 --> 02:03:56,699
I need to, I don't know, I need to get it.

1097
02:03:56,699 --> 02:03:57,739
I need to find a place to get it.

1098
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:12,500
There's no mechanic to feed the cat.

1099
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:30,699
You guys, who do you want to vote?

1100
02:04:30,699 --> 02:04:32,859
Remind me to do this every so often because I will forget.

1101
02:04:32,859 --> 02:04:49,779
Ooh, there we go.

1102
02:04:49,779 --> 02:05:04,619
Deforestation to build parking lots.

1103
02:05:04,619 --> 02:05:08,329
I'm replanting.

1104
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:13,140
Parking lots?

1105
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:14,020
This is a...

1106
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:25,079
I just want to share a little wood.

1107
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:26,539
I don't want to cut it for a while.

1108
02:05:26,539 --> 02:05:49,939
That's why you do a resource day.

1109
02:05:49,939 --> 02:05:51,220
Hates polar bears.

1110
02:05:51,220 --> 02:06:04,390
This tavern is really shitty.

1111
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:19,350
Converted into a TGI Fridays.

1112
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:20,069
This tea is...

1113
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:21,189
Are those places good?

1114
02:06:24,699 --> 02:06:29,100
I feel like it's been so long since I've even sat down at a place like that.

1115
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:34,359
No, people saying no.

1116
02:06:34,359 --> 02:06:36,279
But then, are people going?

1117
02:06:37,159 --> 02:06:39,239
People have to still be going.

1118
02:06:39,239 --> 02:06:40,600
The business still has to be doing okay.

1119
02:06:41,640 --> 02:07:00,779
You know, I feel like a lot of those restaurants

1120
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:14,579
they're so consistent with what they have and what's on the menu and how it tastes.

1121
02:07:14,579 --> 02:07:15,539
I'm trying...

1122
02:07:15,539 --> 02:07:23,189
I can remember distinctly what it tastes like to get a food item from a Chili's or a TGI Fridays.

1123
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:24,229
I know what it's like.

1124
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:25,510
I know exactly what it's like.

1125
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:29,989
And 10, 20, 30 fucking years later, it's going to be the exact same, isn't it?

1126
02:07:32,899 --> 02:07:34,180
That's not really a bad thing.

1127
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:37,130
It's really not a bad thing.

1128
02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:38,789
If you really think about that.

1129
02:07:38,789 --> 02:07:41,510
Okay, I know exactly what it's going to be like in there.

1130
02:07:43,979 --> 02:07:45,260
There's no variables.

1131
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:46,300
I know exactly what it is.

1132
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:50,890
Stop cutting the grass.

1133
02:07:51,529 --> 02:07:55,510
I do what I want to do and you do what you want to do.

1134
02:07:55,510 --> 02:08:09,399
There's nothing else available.

1135
02:08:09,399 --> 02:08:12,579
It's fine in a pinch.

1136
02:08:12,579 --> 02:08:15,539
Yeah, I think that it's fine to operate it that way.

1137
02:08:15,539 --> 02:08:18,470
I feel like a lot of people go there for that reason.

1138
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:24,789
Aren't those restaurants really, really kid-friendly too?

1139
02:08:24,789 --> 02:08:31,979
That consistency carries over with young kids, right?

1140
02:08:31,979 --> 02:08:33,979
Yeah, so it definitely has like a pretty good purpose.

1141
02:08:33,979 --> 02:08:54,439
You have the palette of a 10-year-old.

1142
02:08:54,439 --> 02:08:58,890
Hey, man, I never told you.

1143
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:00,649
Huh?

1144
02:09:00,649 --> 02:09:02,579
I'm telling you, I haven't eaten here.

1145
02:09:03,140 --> 02:09:11,350
I haven't eaten at TGI Fridays.

1146
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:14,779
I don't even have a memory of eating at one.

1147
02:09:14,779 --> 02:09:24,920
It's been a very long time making chocolate chip cookies.

1148
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:25,640
That sounds awesome.

1149
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:31,420
I want to do more of that.

1150
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:33,420
I want to bake brownies and stuff.

1151
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:37,899
I feel like I want to connect more with the world.

1152
02:09:37,899 --> 02:09:38,300
You know what I mean?

1153
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:40,460
I want to bake fucking brownies.

1154
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:41,420
I want to bake cookies.

1155
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:45,619
That's a great idea.

1156
02:09:46,260 --> 02:09:47,779
I'm just going to get the materials.

1157
02:09:47,779 --> 02:09:51,140
I'm going to get the milk, the flour, the eggs,

1158
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:52,979
chocolate sauce and powder, whatever.

1159
02:09:53,939 --> 02:09:54,979
Let's do it.

1160
02:09:54,979 --> 02:10:03,619
I need to connect more with the world.

1161
02:10:06,579 --> 02:10:09,699
I want to get this to a clean 100 and I'm done for a month.

1162
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:29,739
Replant the trees.

1163
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:30,220
I will.

1164
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:39,239
Beauty does that.

1165
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:40,619
Beauty does do that.

1166
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:54,970
It's like, it's cool.

1167
02:10:54,970 --> 02:11:00,340
I'm so paranoid though when it comes to anything.

1168
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:04,170
I'm the type of person that if a burger is,

1169
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:06,979
make sure to cook it for two to four minutes

1170
02:11:06,979 --> 02:11:07,699
aside.

1171
02:11:07,699 --> 02:11:11,260
I will freak out and be like, it's not done.

1172
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:11,739
Is it done?

1173
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:13,739
How red is it in the middle?

1174
02:11:13,739 --> 02:11:14,789
Get a meat thermometer.

1175
02:11:14,789 --> 02:11:16,869
Is it 140 degrees?

1176
02:11:16,869 --> 02:11:23,670
How many degrees is it in the middle?

1177
02:11:23,670 --> 02:11:26,630
I will crack the egg sort of slightly incorrectly

1178
02:11:27,369 --> 02:11:30,119
and just rage quit.

1179
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:31,800
The egg will break and a shell will get in

1180
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:32,760
and I'll just be like, I'm done.

1181
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:33,159
I'm done.

1182
02:11:33,159 --> 02:11:33,640
I fucked it up.

1183
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:34,039
It's over.

1184
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:34,600
I fucked it.

1185
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:35,640
Everything's messed up and I'm done.

1186
02:11:45,369 --> 02:11:46,729
Drama queen.

1187
02:11:49,539 --> 02:11:52,180
I would be such a bad contestant on a cooking show.

1188
02:11:54,409 --> 02:11:56,569
I would crumble if Gordon Ramsay came over to me

1189
02:11:56,569 --> 02:11:57,529
and said anything.

1190
02:11:57,529 --> 02:11:59,619
I would crumble.

1191
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:06,739
But that's not how you crack an egg, you donkey.

1192
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:09,350
Gordon, I'm just going to leave.

1193
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:11,510
Gordon, this is a really fun experience.

1194
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:12,710
I've been here for five minutes.

1195
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:13,670
I'm going to leave.

1196
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:14,229
Thank you.

1197
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:18,149
Appreciate the opportunity to be on kitchen craziness.

1198
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:19,670
But I'm going to leave now.

1199
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:22,949
Are you going to leave?

1200
02:12:22,949 --> 02:12:23,989
You can't just leave.

1201
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:25,270
He's leaving.

1202
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:25,989
And then it would be like,

1203
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:30,550
while I walked out and I'd be like,

1204
02:12:30,550 --> 02:12:32,680
give me the fuck out of here as fast as I can.

1205
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:33,640
He's leaving.

1206
02:12:33,640 --> 02:12:35,399
And everyone's just laughing and making fun of me.

1207
02:12:35,399 --> 02:12:36,039
And I'm just walking.

1208
02:12:36,039 --> 02:12:38,039
Just give me my fucking car and get me out of here.

1209
02:12:38,039 --> 02:12:53,050
I would be out of there in a second.

1210
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:57,210
And then the fart reverb version of that weird violin sound would play.

1211
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:05,380
And then as I'm leaving, I would be the idiot.

1212
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:06,659
I would back into a pole.

1213
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:08,579
I would be like, I'd back up.

1214
02:13:08,579 --> 02:13:09,060
I'm getting out of here.

1215
02:13:09,060 --> 02:13:09,939
I've got to leave.

1216
02:13:09,939 --> 02:13:12,180
And I would be slowly back up and hit a pole.

1217
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:13,619
And it's like, fucking goddamn it.

1218
02:13:13,619 --> 02:13:15,640
I don't know how the cameras are going to come out here.

1219
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,640
And it's going to be like, what did he do?

1220
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:18,600
Oh, that idiot.

1221
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,880
He backed up into a pole.

1222
02:13:20,949 --> 02:13:21,590
Oh, yeah.

1223
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:22,390
Let's go talk to him.

1224
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:23,510
And I'd be looking out the window.

1225
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:26,229
Hey, Gordon, I'm just trying to get out of here, man.

1226
02:13:26,229 --> 02:13:27,640
What are you doing?

1227
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,319
You're backed into the pole.

1228
02:13:29,319 --> 02:13:31,050
I'm so sorry, Gordon.

1229
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:33,020
I'm sorry I cracked the egg wrong.

1230
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:33,899
Please don't hit me.

1231
02:13:33,899 --> 02:13:35,579
And please delete all this footage.

1232
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:42,939
And then they would edit it to make me look like a fucking maniac.

1233
02:13:42,939 --> 02:13:54,779
All right.

1234
02:13:54,779 --> 02:13:56,220
At least I have fuel.

1235
02:13:56,220 --> 02:14:06,340
Let's get this all to 100, or at least high enough.

1236
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:10,060
You know, Gordon Ramsay is mostly playing a character.

1237
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:11,659
Yeah, of course.

1238
02:14:11,659 --> 02:14:27,189
All right, everybody.

1239
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:31,060
We can all collectively relax.

1240
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,760
Everybody just chill.

1241
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,680
I have the cat fed.

1242
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:57,979
There we go.

1243
02:14:57,979 --> 02:15:04,630
By the window?

1244
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:05,430
Yeah, I don't want to.

1245
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:07,750
Yeah, I want it to be a nice, comfortable place.

1246
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:12,340
All right, that's better.

1247
02:15:12,340 --> 02:15:14,550
I got some more stuff, too.

1248
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:20,899
I want to make like a buttered chili pepper beer.

1249
02:15:20,899 --> 02:15:28,180
Congratulations.

1250
02:15:28,180 --> 02:15:31,210
You have brewed your first beer.

1251
02:15:31,210 --> 02:15:36,729
Experiment with new ingredients to create your perfect brew and food.

1252
02:15:36,729 --> 02:15:38,010
Time to farm.

1253
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:44,630
The first thing you'll have to do is clear the grass of an area of land with a shovel.

1254
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:47,460
Oh, all right.

1255
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:48,100
What kind of beer?

1256
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:52,340
I need to make some barley.

1257
02:15:52,340 --> 02:16:05,420
So this is where I need to make it.

1258
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:10,439
All right, I'm going to say over here, take a little section like this.

1259
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,079
Oh, shit.

1260
02:16:17,079 --> 02:16:18,439
Okay, now plant.

1261
02:16:18,439 --> 02:16:23,539
What am I planting?

1262
02:16:23,539 --> 02:16:47,530
I need seeds.

1263
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:49,450
Barley seeds, rye seeds, wheat.

1264
02:16:49,450 --> 02:16:52,069
I want corn.

1265
02:16:52,069 --> 02:16:54,969
Five, let's do 10, 20.

1266
02:16:54,969 --> 02:17:00,149
I need 20 spots.

1267
02:17:00,149 --> 02:17:12,520
Corn is overrated.

1268
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:20,729
Corn is like one of the reasons why modern society developed into the way it did, isn't it?

1269
02:17:20,729 --> 02:17:30,729
Isn't corn one of the most important pieces of agriculture ever?

1270
02:17:30,729 --> 02:17:31,209
It is?

1271
02:17:31,209 --> 02:17:32,010
Yeah, it is.

1272
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:34,040
Okay, now the land is free of grass.

1273
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:39,829
It's time to till like the hoe and till the land where you are going to cultivate your plants.

1274
02:17:39,829 --> 02:17:48,250
In America, yes, but not the rest of the world.

1275
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:51,180
And it's still very important.

1276
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:58,299
The amount of things that are made with corn are unbelievable.

1277
02:17:58,299 --> 02:17:59,180
It's like, really?

1278
02:17:59,180 --> 02:18:00,139
That's a lot of stuff.

1279
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:02,180
Really?

1280
02:18:03,559 --> 02:18:05,799
Okay, now I got to get my seeds.

1281
02:18:05,799 --> 02:18:08,729
How many spots do I need?

1282
02:18:08,729 --> 02:18:09,850
I need more than that.

1283
02:18:09,850 --> 02:18:26,809
Tobacco as well.

1284
02:18:26,809 --> 02:18:29,129
Yes, tobacco as well.

1285
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:38,180
I was just going to get it for free.

1286
02:18:38,180 --> 02:18:55,540
How many spots is this?

1287
02:18:55,540 --> 02:19:04,649
Yeah, you would know about tobacco.

1288
02:19:04,649 --> 02:19:05,290
Cigarette.

1289
02:19:05,290 --> 02:19:12,139
Cigarette meme has kind of really...

1290
02:19:12,139 --> 02:19:12,700
What?

1291
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:14,219
The cigarette meme.

1292
02:19:14,219 --> 02:19:14,780
Isn't that...

1293
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:16,379
Why is that a thing now?

1294
02:19:16,379 --> 02:19:17,860
What happened here?

1295
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:20,500
What's going on here?

1296
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:23,610
What's happening here?

1297
02:19:23,610 --> 02:19:30,920
It's because I've shown myself like smoking fake cigarettes.

1298
02:19:36,139 --> 02:19:37,340
What is with the cigarette?

1299
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:40,700
That's like a thing that has really gotten popular recently.

1300
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:41,100
Don't...

1301
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:42,139
You've seen it too, haven't you?

1302
02:19:42,780 --> 02:19:43,850
I've noticed it.

1303
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:44,569
Have you seen it too?

1304
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:50,549
He still doesn't get it.

1305
02:19:58,709 --> 02:19:59,670
I'm going to go this way.

1306
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:00,790
How many does...

1307
02:20:00,790 --> 02:20:01,430
I got to count this.

1308
02:20:21,799 --> 02:21:09,750
Okay, so we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

1309
02:21:09,750 --> 02:21:20,540
I want it to be...

1310
02:21:21,459 --> 02:21:22,739
Wait, what's going on here?

1311
02:21:22,739 --> 02:21:23,459
Did I do something wrong?

1312
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:31,239
Wait.

1313
02:21:31,239 --> 02:21:32,280
No, that's correct, right?

1314
02:21:37,639 --> 02:21:39,000
Yeah, this is the shape I wanted.

1315
02:21:39,719 --> 02:21:40,040
All right.

1316
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:42,680
Now we just plant a shitload of these.

1317
02:21:43,479 --> 02:21:49,139
Crops will grow over time in three stages.

1318
02:21:49,139 --> 02:21:51,700
Once fully grown, harvest the crop with your sickle.

1319
02:21:51,700 --> 02:22:04,219
Where's my delivery?

1320
02:22:04,219 --> 02:22:15,340
You can't...

1321
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:16,780
I bet you can't name 10 prime numbers.

1322
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:21,819
Do you think I cannot name 10 prime numbers?

1323
02:22:21,819 --> 02:22:25,780
Well, I had to put my phone down because it's dead.

1324
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:30,819
And I was going to kill some time while I looked it up.

1325
02:22:30,819 --> 02:22:33,799
But you're right, I can't.

1326
02:22:33,799 --> 02:22:34,280
It's late.

1327
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:35,239
Oh, my God.

1328
02:22:35,239 --> 02:22:39,500
I was going to do the thing where I repeat the question

1329
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:45,420
and then slowly talk and distract you while I look the thing up.

1330
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:47,899
And then I say the thing while talking

1331
02:22:47,899 --> 02:22:50,379
immediately finishing a sentence or two.

1332
02:22:50,379 --> 02:22:51,959
So it's like, there's no way he looked it up.

1333
02:22:51,959 --> 02:23:03,540
He's been talking to us already.

1334
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:03,860
Damn.

1335
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:04,020
All right.

1336
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:04,340
Hold on.

1337
02:23:04,340 --> 02:23:04,979
I need...

1338
02:23:04,979 --> 02:23:05,780
Where's my delivery?

1339
02:23:07,299 --> 02:23:07,860
There it is.

1340
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:11,030
All right.

1341
02:23:11,030 --> 02:23:11,750
Let's get this planted.

1342
02:23:15,579 --> 02:23:15,899
Okay.

1343
02:23:16,459 --> 02:23:20,860
I will tell you, I thought this game was way more limited than I thought.

1344
02:23:23,319 --> 02:23:27,399
It's slowly kind of ripping in stuff to do.

1345
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:33,110
I need more of these.

1346
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:40,940
I need way more of those.

1347
02:23:40,940 --> 02:23:42,979
How many do I need?

1348
02:23:42,979 --> 02:23:49,879
One, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 30, 40, 15.

1349
02:23:49,879 --> 02:23:51,559
I need 15 more of those.

1350
02:23:51,559 --> 02:23:55,639
I want corn.

1351
02:23:55,639 --> 02:23:56,680
I don't want anything else.

1352
02:23:56,680 --> 02:24:07,079
Is this ready to harvest?

1353
02:24:07,079 --> 02:24:07,639
Not yet.

1354
02:24:07,639 --> 02:24:09,000
No, there's no corn on it.

1355
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:16,420
Let's go.

1356
02:24:16,979 --> 02:24:18,819
I'm going to make...

1357
02:24:18,819 --> 02:24:20,260
So what do I actually want to do here?

1358
02:24:20,260 --> 02:24:21,299
What do I need?

1359
02:24:21,299 --> 02:24:24,760
I need more ale, which I have some up here.

1360
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:30,780
Let's make a new thing here.

1361
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:33,100
I need water.

1362
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:35,180
How much water do I have?

1363
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:36,360
All right.

1364
02:24:36,360 --> 02:24:37,239
I need water.

1365
02:24:37,239 --> 02:24:41,059
Should I get this game?

1366
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:45,430
But that all depends if you like what you see.

1367
02:24:45,430 --> 02:24:53,159
I think the game's fun.

1368
02:24:53,159 --> 02:24:56,569
Scratching a couple of decent itches for me.

1369
02:24:56,569 --> 02:24:59,379
But that's a decision that you need to make.

1370
02:24:59,379 --> 02:25:03,270
I think it's pretty cool, but I'm not you.

1371
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:17,219
Cat's heart is increasing.

1372
02:25:17,219 --> 02:25:23,700
I'm not ready to open.

1373
02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:31,139
Are you actually that moisturized or is that a lie?

1374
02:25:31,139 --> 02:25:38,870
That's got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard to lie about.

1375
02:25:43,819 --> 02:25:47,020
I can't really think of very much that would be dumber to say than...

1376
02:25:47,020 --> 02:25:49,260
Yeah, I moisturize my face and I just don't.

1377
02:25:49,979 --> 02:25:51,700
Why even bring it up?

1378
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:55,899
I can't think...

1379
02:25:55,899 --> 02:25:57,260
Why would I even bring it up?

1380
02:25:57,260 --> 02:25:59,420
That's such a strange thing to lie about.

1381
02:26:02,250 --> 02:26:03,370
Yeah, I like to moisturize.

1382
02:26:04,709 --> 02:26:05,510
I don't, though.

1383
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:07,350
But if I just don't, this just doesn't make any sense.

1384
02:26:07,909 --> 02:26:08,950
Why even bring it up?

1385
02:26:10,549 --> 02:26:11,590
I have points to spend.

1386
02:26:12,229 --> 02:26:16,360
We're going to go the mead tree, right?

1387
02:26:21,159 --> 02:26:21,559
Cabbage.

1388
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:25,780
Root?

1389
02:26:25,780 --> 02:26:26,739
Apples and pears?

1390
02:26:29,610 --> 02:26:30,649
Basic carpentry.

1391
02:26:32,579 --> 02:26:33,860
Large bench, large table.

1392
02:26:35,959 --> 02:26:36,360
Lighting.

1393
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:37,739
Oil lamp.

1394
02:26:38,379 --> 02:26:41,959
I want to go...

1395
02:26:41,959 --> 02:26:42,520
Let's go mead.

1396
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:44,489
Mead.

1397
02:26:46,409 --> 02:26:56,069
Wine is next.

1398
02:26:56,069 --> 02:26:56,790
And...

1399
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:59,079
What about food?

1400
02:26:59,079 --> 02:27:00,440
Buy a wall calendar.

1401
02:27:02,549 --> 02:27:03,510
Plant 10 season heart.

1402
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:05,270
Okay, so I need to buy a wall calendar.

1403
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:08,569
I'm playing with the controller.

1404
02:27:10,569 --> 02:27:12,489
If a controller is available, I will play with it.

1405
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:16,379
Playing games with the keyboard,

1406
02:27:17,590 --> 02:27:20,709
I think the last couple of years, I want to say, hurts my hands.

1407
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:27,219
Not anything too extreme, but that WASD position,

1408
02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:29,139
and I really noticed it last night,

1409
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,879
that WASD sometimes, and even the arrow keys,

1410
02:27:34,860 --> 02:27:37,420
can kind of cramp up my fingers for some reason.

1411
02:27:37,979 --> 02:27:40,500
So if analog is a lot...

1412
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:43,620
Resting my hands sort of on my lap with the analog

1413
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:45,620
is a lot easier for me at this point.

1414
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:50,059
Okay, well, I needed to buy...

1415
02:27:50,059 --> 02:27:50,540
What was it?

1416
02:27:50,540 --> 02:27:51,500
A wall calendar.

1417
02:27:52,059 --> 02:28:07,940
I want a mental armor sack.

1418
02:28:08,739 --> 02:28:10,229
Probably going to need the scarecrow.

1419
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:12,329
Could be arthritis.

1420
02:28:12,409 --> 02:28:13,209
It probably is.

1421
02:28:14,010 --> 02:28:17,799
I imagine it's something like that, probably.

1422
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:21,319
There we go.

1423
02:28:21,319 --> 02:28:22,040
80!

1424
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,479
No, thank you.

1425
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:28,940
I'm not spending $80 on a wall calendar.

1426
02:28:29,579 --> 02:28:33,110
Does it have any game mechanic?

1427
02:28:36,379 --> 02:28:37,260
80 for a...

1428
02:28:37,260 --> 02:28:38,139
What does it do?

1429
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:44,250
Maybe it will.

1430
02:28:44,250 --> 02:28:45,670
Does it do something?

1431
02:28:52,870 --> 02:28:55,030
Probably RSI, not arthritis.

1432
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:57,590
Well, I don't want to speculate on what it is.

1433
02:28:58,469 --> 02:29:02,500
Yeah, what does it do?

1434
02:29:03,639 --> 02:29:05,079
No lewd pics.

1435
02:29:05,799 --> 02:29:06,120
What?

1436
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:07,719
Just adds comfort.

1437
02:29:07,719 --> 02:29:07,959
Okay.

1438
02:29:07,959 --> 02:29:08,440
Well, that's...

1439
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:08,920
Yeah, okay.

1440
02:29:09,719 --> 02:29:24,620
All right, plant.

1441
02:29:33,770 --> 02:29:35,049
Hey, it's full.

1442
02:29:35,049 --> 02:29:41,620
Why did I make all that corn?

1443
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:44,780
Is it for a purpose?

1444
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:54,200
This does take a long time.

1445
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:58,340
Okay, I can make the mead.

1446
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:58,979
The mead needs...

1447
02:29:58,979 --> 02:29:59,780
Oh, there is honey.

1448
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:03,379
Wine yeast and an empty keg.

1449
02:30:03,379 --> 02:30:04,180
I have an empty keg.

1450
02:30:04,739 --> 02:30:06,780
Let me get some wine yeast.

1451
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:08,549
I want mead.

1452
02:30:21,159 --> 02:30:22,840
You sold out to big corn.

1453
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:31,159
Orange.

1454
02:30:31,159 --> 02:30:32,200
I got plenty of orange.

1455
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:33,079
It's not worth it.

1456
02:30:33,079 --> 02:30:41,510
Okay, I want the empty keg.

1457
02:30:42,149 --> 02:30:43,659
So I have this.

1458
02:30:43,659 --> 02:30:45,899
I have this mild ale.

1459
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:48,540
And oh goodness, I'm sorry.

1460
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:52,069
But this one's going to be where I put the mead.

1461
02:30:52,629 --> 02:30:53,430
Mead is going to be one.

1462
02:30:53,989 --> 02:31:05,909
In the man of Medan stream, you used a controller,

1463
02:31:05,909 --> 02:31:07,510
but then in the next dark picture stream,

1464
02:31:07,510 --> 02:31:10,069
you mocked italics for using a controller

1465
02:31:10,069 --> 02:31:11,989
and proudly used a keyboard instead

1466
02:31:11,989 --> 02:31:14,069
because you were a proud PC gamer,

1467
02:31:14,069 --> 02:31:17,100
which then caused you to miss an important QTE

1468
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:23,909
because your DPI settings were fucked up.

1469
02:31:23,909 --> 02:31:29,979
Yeah, that was so fucked up though.

1470
02:31:31,530 --> 02:31:34,489
Needing to move my mouse like 10 times.

1471
02:31:45,879 --> 02:31:46,840
That was really funny.

1472
02:31:47,239 --> 02:31:51,079
I'm glad it was funny because it was incredibly embarrassing.

1473
02:31:51,799 --> 02:31:54,489
Oh, I got to plant these trees.

1474
02:31:55,129 --> 02:32:08,090
Any more?

1475
02:32:17,530 --> 02:32:20,020
Cool.

1476
02:32:20,020 --> 02:32:20,899
Resource day or no?

1477
02:32:28,489 --> 02:32:32,709
You know, it's so funny about what we just said

1478
02:32:32,709 --> 02:32:33,590
and what we just talked about.

1479
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:42,379
Some of you guys know this channel's history

1480
02:32:42,379 --> 02:32:43,180
more than I do.

1481
02:32:43,739 --> 02:32:46,200
Isn't that interesting?

1482
02:32:49,579 --> 02:32:52,620
Like specifically for streams,

1483
02:32:54,780 --> 02:32:57,340
I stream and I say a bunch of stuff

1484
02:32:57,340 --> 02:32:59,659
and we fuck around, we make some jokes.

1485
02:32:59,979 --> 02:33:01,180
Maybe I'll chill, we'll just talk,

1486
02:33:01,180 --> 02:33:02,459
we'll bring up stories, whatever we do.

1487
02:33:02,459 --> 02:33:04,600
We just kind of hang out, whatever it is.

1488
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:08,010
That conversation is usually gone

1489
02:33:08,010 --> 02:33:11,850
from my brain a week or two later.

1490
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:16,120
So there's almost like this encyclopedia

1491
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:18,600
of things I've said that I don't even,

1492
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:20,280
I remember talking about it for sure,

1493
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:22,360
but I know it's not like up in the front of the brain.

1494
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:27,049
It's funny to look back and have it be like,

1495
02:33:27,049 --> 02:33:29,129
oh yeah, I like using controllers.

1496
02:33:29,129 --> 02:33:32,100
I like them, it's much, much better.

1497
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:34,700
Hey, three years ago,

1498
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:36,059
you said that controllers were stupid

1499
02:33:36,059 --> 02:33:37,420
and people that used them were dumb.

1500
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:38,379
And it's like, oh, I did.

1501
02:33:40,379 --> 02:33:45,690
I mean, I didn't mean to, I guess, I'm sorry.

1502
02:33:52,340 --> 02:33:54,180
You have talked about how corn is the basis

1503
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:56,420
of civilization at least a few times already though.

1504
02:33:56,420 --> 02:33:57,780
All right, so I'm consistent on that.

1505
02:33:58,500 --> 02:33:59,379
That's good.

1506
02:33:59,379 --> 02:34:14,569
That's why you could be gaslit so easily.

1507
02:34:15,209 --> 02:34:17,379
Where's my wine?

1508
02:34:17,379 --> 02:34:17,940
I bought it.

1509
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:19,620
I had to wait three hours.

1510
02:34:25,770 --> 02:34:28,889
Finally, I want to make mead.

1511
02:34:34,760 --> 02:34:36,840
Didn't you say that corn grew on trees before?

1512
02:34:37,639 --> 02:34:41,700
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1513
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,540
No, stupid idiot.

1514
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:45,299
Can I cancel it and get it back?

1515
02:34:45,299 --> 02:34:46,979
I didn't, I wanted to add ingredients to that.

1516
02:34:48,819 --> 02:34:51,459
I just put like basic ass bullshit in that.

1517
02:34:55,379 --> 02:34:58,420
No, I never believed that corn grew on trees.

1518
02:35:01,860 --> 02:35:03,219
I tell jokes.

1519
02:35:03,219 --> 02:35:05,420
It says cancel.

1520
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:07,180
I know it does, but I just want to fucking.

1521
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:10,969
I don't think that corn grows on trees.

1522
02:35:11,610 --> 02:35:13,739
I think a lot of people,

1523
02:35:13,739 --> 02:35:15,979
some people take the things that I say on the stream sometimes.

1524
02:35:18,780 --> 02:35:22,459
Some people believe that I think that corn grows on trees.

1525
02:35:23,260 --> 02:35:23,979
You know what I mean?

1526
02:35:23,979 --> 02:35:26,459
Like, no, I promise you, I don't.

1527
02:35:27,020 --> 02:35:32,950
You don't tell good jokes.

1528
02:35:33,590 --> 02:35:34,950
I never said the quality of them.

1529
02:35:35,670 --> 02:35:36,309
You said I do.

1530
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:39,659
That's for you to decide, not me.

1531
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:57,379
What do you actually believe about bananas?

1532
02:35:57,940 --> 02:36:01,979
That they are a nice snack and slightly ripe bananas

1533
02:36:01,979 --> 02:36:04,299
are I think better than I'm a big fan of.

1534
02:36:04,299 --> 02:36:06,299
Slightly ripe bananas, bananas are a good snack.

1535
02:36:09,219 --> 02:36:09,620
That's it.

1536
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:12,120
Oh, Pog.

1537
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:12,680
Oh my God.

1538
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,959
Yeah, he loves bananas.

1539
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:18,700
Do I have enough?

1540
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:22,469
I need this mead to hurry up.

1541
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:32,700
I'm just gonna go to bed.

1542
02:36:33,260 --> 02:36:34,700
I'm just gonna wake up and it'll be done.

1543
02:36:42,899 --> 02:36:43,139
Nice.

1544
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:49,739
All right, I got mead.

1545
02:36:50,299 --> 02:36:53,190
I've ruined everything, unfortunately,

1546
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:58,139
because I need an empty keg.

1547
02:36:58,860 --> 02:37:04,059
I guess I'm going to buy honey

1548
02:37:04,059 --> 02:37:05,500
and I'm going to put the empty keg in here.

1549
02:37:06,059 --> 02:37:11,620
Because I want to add chili peppers to it and all this stuff.

1550
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:20,950
I have that, so I need, I have, I already have an empty keg.

1551
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:22,409
I need honey.

1552
02:37:30,149 --> 02:37:37,780
I think I can open the store, though.

1553
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:39,299
Yeah, I, I, I, yeah.

1554
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:41,100
Let's open the store.

1555
02:37:41,659 --> 02:37:43,350
I already have this one on tap.

1556
02:37:43,350 --> 02:37:45,829
That was my, my mild brew.

1557
02:37:46,389 --> 02:37:48,149
And we can put the mead in here.

1558
02:37:49,719 --> 02:37:50,920
Several unique items in stock.

1559
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:52,120
The more unique items you have in stock,

1560
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:54,040
the more reputation and money you'll earn.

1561
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:57,209
This only counts the base item, ignoring any modifiers.

1562
02:37:57,209 --> 02:37:57,850
Okay, well, that's good.

1563
02:37:58,569 --> 02:38:00,170
I got plenty of porridge.

1564
02:38:01,260 --> 02:38:02,700
Make sure the tables are set in the right way.

1565
02:38:05,379 --> 02:38:08,569
I could make another bench, but open.

1566
02:38:08,569 --> 02:38:21,610
Does Holly ever remind you of stuff

1567
02:38:21,610 --> 02:38:25,139
that you have said that you forgot?

1568
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:27,030
Yes.

1569
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:32,860
For instance, you guys will like this one.

1570
02:38:33,579 --> 02:38:35,420
Oh shit.

1571
02:38:35,420 --> 02:38:35,819
What is it?

1572
02:38:35,819 --> 02:38:36,139
This one?

1573
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:47,940
Um, my mother sent me a message the other day.

1574
02:38:48,739 --> 02:38:51,299
Would you like to know what it said?

1575
02:38:53,479 --> 02:38:56,379
It said, face cam or riot.

1576
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:59,290
It is my mother.

1577
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:16,649
And I was just like, uh, ma, hold on.

1578
02:39:16,649 --> 02:39:25,450
She's one of us.

1579
02:39:29,159 --> 02:39:31,079
You got to do it for ma, do it for ma.

1580
02:39:31,719 --> 02:39:34,809
Hey, I was on face cam yesterday.

1581
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:43,610
All right, I'm making way more money.

1582
02:39:43,610 --> 02:40:00,010
All right, come on, hurry up and give me a good rating.

1583
02:40:00,090 --> 02:40:05,299
The best meat in this whole town.

1584
02:40:05,299 --> 02:40:05,940
Thank you.

1585
02:40:05,940 --> 02:40:13,850
Is it good?

1586
02:40:13,850 --> 02:40:17,180
How's the stew?

1587
02:40:17,180 --> 02:40:19,219
How's the smell in here?

1588
02:40:19,219 --> 02:40:30,659
No keg.

1589
02:40:30,659 --> 02:40:33,049
Oh, is it cold?

1590
02:40:33,049 --> 02:40:44,579
Oh shit.

1591
02:40:44,579 --> 02:40:55,030
The meat is popular.

1592
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:56,469
Meat is very popular.

1593
02:40:56,469 --> 02:41:01,340
Wait till I add a little bit of spices in it.

1594
02:41:01,340 --> 02:41:09,750
Yes, I'll wipe your table.

1595
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:10,309
Just wait.

1596
02:41:10,309 --> 02:41:20,600
This shit is flying off the shelves.

1597
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:23,379
This one's pretty good.

1598
02:41:23,379 --> 02:41:24,979
Oh, no one's bought a single meat.

1599
02:41:24,979 --> 02:41:25,860
Nevermind.

1600
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:29,219
Am I supposed to take my shoes off in here?

1601
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:30,659
What?

1602
02:41:30,659 --> 02:41:48,540
One feels like a noble here.

1603
02:41:48,540 --> 02:41:50,299
I'm the best.

1604
02:41:50,299 --> 02:41:51,500
I want to speak to the barkeep.

1605
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:51,899
What's wrong?

1606
02:41:52,620 --> 02:41:53,020
I want to...

1607
02:41:53,579 --> 02:42:08,549
Nobody touched that corn outside, by the way.

1608
02:42:12,659 --> 02:42:15,219
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make.

1609
02:42:15,219 --> 02:42:19,159
If anybody touches the corn outside, you're dead.

1610
02:42:32,629 --> 02:42:39,299
All the corn is gone tomorrow, by the way.

1611
02:42:39,299 --> 02:42:40,659
I wake up and it's all gone.

1612
02:42:40,659 --> 02:42:47,000
What do you think?

1613
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,840
100 silver would probably do it.

1614
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:55,370
How's the temperature?

1615
02:42:55,370 --> 02:42:55,930
Too hot?

1616
02:42:55,930 --> 02:42:56,329
I got it.

1617
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,340
Bro, it grows on trees.

1618
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:09,840
Chill.

1619
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:26,360
Where's the nearest poplar?

1620
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:50,680
Is it gone?

1621
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:57,159
Close it up?

1622
02:43:57,159 --> 02:43:57,879
No.

1623
02:43:57,879 --> 02:44:02,629
I'm not closing it until at least 100.

1624
02:44:04,020 --> 02:44:05,059
I think I need more money.

1625
02:44:05,059 --> 02:44:12,700
I'll try to make another couple of stuff to do fermentation.

1626
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:27,209
It's only noon.

1627
02:44:27,209 --> 02:44:29,129
I'll probably run out of product before then, though.

1628
02:44:29,129 --> 02:44:39,670
How much is left?

1629
02:44:39,670 --> 02:44:41,110
I'm just going to go to these both.

1630
02:44:41,110 --> 02:44:42,309
I'm going to go till I sell everything.

1631
02:44:42,309 --> 02:44:45,260
I think that's the play.

1632
02:44:45,260 --> 02:45:07,239
Do I have a favorite season?

1633
02:45:07,239 --> 02:45:08,600
Not really.

1634
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:15,430
I like winter and I like summer.

1635
02:45:15,430 --> 02:45:19,209
Fall in Vegas is really, really nice.

1636
02:45:19,209 --> 02:45:21,239
It's not hot, but it's just kind of nice out.

1637
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:25,139
If I were to take...

1638
02:45:26,729 --> 02:45:27,129
I don't know.

1639
02:45:27,770 --> 02:45:30,649
I'm not like a big spring person.

1640
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:32,069
I like it.

1641
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:33,899
I don't know why.

1642
02:45:33,899 --> 02:45:38,059
I like the cold, crispy air of fall and winter.

1643
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:44,139
And I like the heat and kind of outdoor, kind of hot stuff.

1644
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:47,100
I like the outdoor heat of summertime.

1645
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:05,000
I like spring.

1646
02:46:05,719 --> 02:46:07,319
Spring is nice.

1647
02:46:07,879 --> 02:46:15,030
Wouldn't a gardener love spring?

1648
02:46:20,149 --> 02:46:22,709
Yeah, but I mean, sunflowers...

1649
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:27,930
When we grew the sunflowers, that was May, June, right?

1650
02:46:27,930 --> 02:46:28,649
Wasn't it like May?

1651
02:46:28,649 --> 02:46:29,690
That was like May, June, July.

1652
02:46:30,409 --> 02:46:31,430
Until like August.

1653
02:46:32,069 --> 02:46:33,639
That was summertime.

1654
02:46:33,639 --> 02:46:47,399
I'm so glad I'm actually making money now.

1655
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:49,899
They grow in the spring too.

1656
02:46:53,620 --> 02:46:56,420
All I remember is I just need a lot of sun.

1657
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:58,500
It is in the name, isn't it?

1658
02:46:58,500 --> 02:46:59,219
Right?

1659
02:46:59,219 --> 02:47:01,190
Oh, this is popular.

1660
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:03,290
It grew.

1661
02:47:03,850 --> 02:47:12,870
All right, this is empty, so I got to sell out of the mead

1662
02:47:12,870 --> 02:47:13,750
and then we'll close up.

1663
02:47:35,899 --> 02:47:36,700
Sell out of everything.

1664
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:44,090
Winter has really beautiful moments,

1665
02:47:44,090 --> 02:47:45,450
but it's overall dark and lonely.

1666
02:47:50,299 --> 02:47:53,430
You know, so the thing with winter,

1667
02:47:54,659 --> 02:47:56,979
something about getting up in the morning,

1668
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:00,680
still really, really cold outside,

1669
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:05,370
just having a hot cup of coffee just in your hands.

1670
02:48:06,010 --> 02:48:07,059
It's super cold.

1671
02:48:07,059 --> 02:48:08,579
Everything's really chilly, but you just,

1672
02:48:08,579 --> 02:48:11,540
you got that hot coffee, just hot cup of coffee right there.

1673
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:14,549
It changes everything.

1674
02:48:15,270 --> 02:48:36,219
I really, coffee to me, it's not even,

1675
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:39,260
I mean, maybe it is a little bit for the caffeine at this point,

1676
02:48:39,260 --> 02:48:40,860
because obviously I've been taking in caffeine

1677
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:42,700
pretty much every single day for a long time.

1678
02:48:43,659 --> 02:48:46,520
But it's almost, I just, I like, I just love that.

1679
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:48,680
Tea, you can do this with tea.

1680
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:52,790
Tea hits a little differently for me though.

1681
02:48:52,790 --> 02:48:55,430
I would rather drink tea in the evening hours,

1682
02:48:55,430 --> 02:48:56,149
not in the morning.

1683
02:48:56,709 --> 02:48:57,750
Tea is an evening thing for me.

1684
02:49:01,739 --> 02:49:05,750
Nice, hot, just black coffee.

1685
02:49:06,469 --> 02:49:08,790
And it just, it just, it's got that scent.

1686
02:49:08,790 --> 02:49:09,590
It's just there.

1687
02:49:09,590 --> 02:49:12,709
It's just hot, steaming, freezing outside.

1688
02:49:12,709 --> 02:49:15,909
It's cold, absolutely rigid outside.

1689
02:49:25,059 --> 02:49:27,940
Sometimes, sometimes even just kind of go outside

1690
02:49:27,940 --> 02:49:31,030
with the coffee and just be one of those

1691
02:49:31,030 --> 02:49:33,909
cheesy commercial motherfuckers that has the bathrobe on.

1692
02:49:33,909 --> 02:49:34,469
You know what I mean?

1693
02:49:34,469 --> 02:49:37,030
Just like wearing their like morning clothes.

1694
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:49,000
It's like, ah, and all those coffee commercials.

1695
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:49,479
What's wrong?

1696
02:50:01,610 --> 02:50:02,889
It's a Hallmark movie.

1697
02:50:03,770 --> 02:50:09,799
All right, I'm out of, do I have any more porridge?

1698
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:15,319
All right, we are out.

1699
02:50:15,319 --> 02:50:18,760
I've got two more of each and then I've got no more porridge.

1700
02:50:26,549 --> 02:50:30,149
The smell of coffee to me is what I like the most about it.

1701
02:50:40,729 --> 02:50:45,129
To me, smelling coffee and hearing like a coffee being brewed,

1702
02:50:46,809 --> 02:50:48,010
it doesn't matter what kind of coffee,

1703
02:50:48,010 --> 02:50:49,290
what kind of coffee machine you have

1704
02:50:49,290 --> 02:50:50,809
or whatever, if you have like a coffee maker,

1705
02:50:50,809 --> 02:50:51,690
it doesn't matter what kind.

1706
02:50:52,809 --> 02:50:58,100
That like, here it comes, like, and it's,

1707
02:50:58,659 --> 02:51:00,180
it's almost, it's like you opened up like the,

1708
02:51:00,180 --> 02:51:01,860
where the treats are for the dog.

1709
02:51:01,860 --> 02:51:03,139
It's like, what, what's that?

1710
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,280
Coffee, somebody make, somebody making coffee.

1711
02:51:06,280 --> 02:51:07,319
Somebody's making coffee here.

1712
02:51:07,879 --> 02:51:08,360
I want one.

1713
02:51:11,700 --> 02:51:12,500
I love coffee.

1714
02:51:13,139 --> 02:51:22,389
It's too dark in here.

1715
02:51:23,110 --> 02:51:25,979
What happened to my candles?

1716
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:31,610
All right, somebody buy the last two beers,

1717
02:51:31,610 --> 02:51:33,450
last four beers so I can close.

1718
02:51:39,479 --> 02:51:45,000
That coffee maker sound, then you all know the one.

1719
02:51:45,559 --> 02:51:54,340
Like that drip coffee that is one of those things

1720
02:51:54,340 --> 02:51:56,659
that just is one of the little things in life.

1721
02:51:57,540 --> 02:52:01,610
It's just, ah, yeah, that's a, that's great.

1722
02:52:01,610 --> 02:52:02,889
Whatever is going on right now.

1723
02:52:04,309 --> 02:52:05,989
You fucking weirdo, go outside.

1724
02:52:06,870 --> 02:52:14,280
I, you're acting like I just drink coffee

1725
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:17,399
and sit in that, I don't just drink coffee.

1726
02:52:17,399 --> 02:52:18,120
What?

1727
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:19,879
I'm talking about a morning routine.

1728
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:24,280
I don't just make coffee and like, ah, ooh, yeah.

1729
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:25,079
Like, hey, what's that?

1730
02:52:25,079 --> 02:52:26,040
Is that coffee being rude?

1731
02:52:26,840 --> 02:52:29,979
Like every 25 minutes?

1732
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:33,030
I'm talking about starting the day.

1733
02:52:33,909 --> 02:52:35,350
I'm talking about you make coffee

1734
02:52:35,350 --> 02:52:36,790
and then you start your day

1735
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:39,909
and you do whatever you're going to do.

1736
02:52:43,459 --> 02:52:45,620
No, the thing I say we're talking about right now

1737
02:52:45,620 --> 02:52:47,620
is not the only thing I do all day.

1738
02:52:48,260 --> 02:52:50,459
Oh, you know what?

1739
02:52:50,459 --> 02:52:51,739
Man, I love corn.

1740
02:52:51,739 --> 02:52:52,860
Corn's so great, isn't it?

1741
02:52:54,579 --> 02:52:55,540
All he does is eat corn.

1742
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,659
It's the only thing he does.

1743
02:52:56,659 --> 02:52:58,659
He has corn just growing all over his house.

1744
02:52:59,219 --> 02:53:00,870
What's wrong with him?

1745
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:01,989
Why does he just only eat corn?

1746
02:53:02,629 --> 02:53:05,620
He has corn.

1747
02:53:05,620 --> 02:53:08,819
This corn, he has corn and he literally is,

1748
02:53:08,819 --> 02:53:10,739
he's sitting on a furniture made out of corn.

1749
02:53:11,459 --> 02:53:19,350
No, I just like corn.

1750
02:53:19,350 --> 02:53:21,030
We're talking about coffee.

1751
02:53:21,030 --> 02:53:22,069
We're talking about coffee.

1752
02:53:22,790 --> 02:53:26,969
Somebody buy this.

1753
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:30,620
I don't want four beers just sitting here.

1754
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:44,549
Character upgrades.

1755
02:53:45,110 --> 02:53:46,659
What's that?

1756
02:53:53,079 --> 02:53:53,799
Hold on.

1757
02:53:53,799 --> 02:54:02,549
I don't have any candles left.

1758
02:54:02,549 --> 02:54:03,750
I have to make some new ones, I think.

1759
02:54:18,409 --> 02:54:19,049
Everybody get out.

1760
02:54:23,079 --> 02:54:25,159
I think they have to order it if it's still on the tap.

1761
02:54:25,719 --> 02:54:36,219
Make sure to give us a good rating.

1762
02:54:45,530 --> 02:54:46,090
Plus one.

1763
02:54:46,090 --> 02:54:47,610
Is that even really a good rating?

1764
02:54:48,250 --> 02:54:53,370
Plus one.

1765
02:54:54,010 --> 02:55:16,420
All right, let me turn this off.

1766
02:55:16,420 --> 02:55:21,959
That was a good day.

1767
02:55:21,959 --> 02:55:23,079
I have almost two gold.

1768
02:55:23,079 --> 02:55:41,620
What about the germ of corn gift?

1769
02:55:41,620 --> 02:55:43,559
That's right.

1770
02:55:43,559 --> 02:55:51,850
There's a corn gift.

1771
02:55:51,850 --> 02:55:54,620
I need to sort this.

1772
02:55:54,620 --> 02:56:08,440
How do I get this off the screen?

1773
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:08,680
Whoa.

1774
02:56:09,319 --> 02:56:24,200
All right, I need candles.

1775
02:56:24,200 --> 02:56:25,639
Make mead again and this time.

1776
02:56:25,639 --> 02:56:35,459
Ooh, here we go.

1777
02:56:35,459 --> 02:56:36,979
Ten seeds and harvest crops.

1778
02:56:36,979 --> 02:56:38,540
I got something for that.

1779
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:50,540
I shall mine and none of it's for you.

1780
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:55,260
What is this?

1781
02:56:55,260 --> 02:56:57,430
A grinder.

1782
02:56:57,989 --> 02:57:02,069
Grind cereals and other ingredients.

1783
02:57:02,069 --> 02:57:02,709
Yeah.

1784
02:57:02,709 --> 02:57:15,340
Where can I put this?

1785
02:57:15,340 --> 02:57:19,959
In the house?

1786
02:57:28,379 --> 02:57:33,239
Can I make the house bigger?

1787
02:57:33,239 --> 02:57:45,909
Okay, wheat flour, barley flour, rye flour.

1788
02:57:45,909 --> 02:57:46,950
Where's corn flour?

1789
02:57:46,950 --> 02:58:11,059
I don't want to buy that many candles.

1790
02:58:11,379 --> 02:58:12,819
I have to be able to make them, right?

1791
02:58:12,819 --> 02:58:28,920
You can't make beer from corn.

1792
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:33,219
You can make other alcohols, though.

1793
02:58:33,219 --> 02:58:37,159
Isn't moonshine corn?

1794
02:58:37,159 --> 02:58:44,889
The corn mash can be.

1795
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:58,059
Moonshine isn't beer.

1796
02:58:58,059 --> 02:58:59,579
You can probably make it in the game, though.

1797
02:58:59,579 --> 02:59:01,979
And it's a game about making alcohol.

1798
02:59:01,979 --> 02:59:08,760
All right, material dump time.

1799
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:11,719
I want all right.

1800
02:59:11,719 --> 02:59:18,260
We're gonna make a ton of make a bunch of copper bars.

1801
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:22,309
Good idea.

1802
02:59:22,309 --> 02:59:24,409
Bunch of screws.

1803
02:59:24,969 --> 02:59:39,639
Maybe a bunch of maybe some hinges and birdhouse.

1804
02:59:41,479 --> 02:59:45,639
Make a birdhouse, birdhouse.

1805
02:59:45,639 --> 02:59:46,680
This is kind of expensive.

1806
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:55,959
It's actually really expensive.

1807
02:59:55,959 --> 03:00:04,549
We talked about the bird watching stream, right?

1808
03:00:04,549 --> 03:00:05,989
And I'm just going to give some stuff away.

1809
03:00:05,989 --> 03:00:07,510
It's not this train is probably never going to happen.

1810
03:00:07,510 --> 03:00:09,909
But like, maybe if it does, you'll be able to remember this.

1811
03:00:09,909 --> 03:00:14,250
I want to like the bird watching stream would like,

1812
03:00:14,250 --> 03:00:15,930
look, we're going to go on a bird watch.

1813
03:00:16,489 --> 03:00:24,840
And then, I don't know, like get like a Bigfoot sighting on camera.

1814
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:28,600
And the rest of the stream turns into like there's Bigfoot.

1815
03:00:28,600 --> 03:00:29,959
And he's like fucking hunting us.

1816
03:00:32,809 --> 03:00:33,770
Don't tell anybody.

1817
03:00:33,770 --> 03:00:34,649
Don't tell anybody.

1818
03:00:34,649 --> 03:00:35,610
I think that's a fun idea.

1819
03:00:36,250 --> 03:00:55,590
This stream is not going to happen though.

1820
03:00:55,590 --> 03:01:01,989
It's fun to talk about things that would have been or may have been.

1821
03:01:14,659 --> 03:01:20,500
Time, time.

1822
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:23,819
Here we go.

1823
03:01:23,819 --> 03:01:27,940
Barley going in.

1824
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:29,059
That going in.

1825
03:01:30,819 --> 03:01:32,840
Mead going in.

1826
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:39,559
But first, I'm going to make sure I have chili pepper, butter.

1827
03:01:39,559 --> 03:01:44,739
All right, chili pepper and butter in the mead.

1828
03:01:45,739 --> 03:01:47,340
Let's see if anybody pukes.

1829
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:55,129
I can't.

1830
03:01:55,129 --> 03:01:55,770
Huh?

1831
03:01:55,770 --> 03:02:06,649
I don't think I can do it.

1832
03:02:06,649 --> 03:02:09,110
I can put honey in the mild ale.

1833
03:02:09,110 --> 03:02:13,340
That's probably maybe that's a good idea.

1834
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:18,649
And what else can I do?

1835
03:02:18,649 --> 03:02:20,489
Serve cups of melted butter.

1836
03:02:22,569 --> 03:02:28,469
Oh, aroma hops.

1837
03:02:29,110 --> 03:02:30,309
I should probably get some aroma.

1838
03:02:32,840 --> 03:02:37,989
Bitter aroma dual hops.

1839
03:02:40,180 --> 03:02:41,059
Just mix it all together.

1840
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:42,649
Who cares, right?

1841
03:02:42,649 --> 03:02:43,770
Just mix everything.

1842
03:02:43,770 --> 03:02:49,399
We're going to have we're going to have wicked bitter ale.

1843
03:02:57,049 --> 03:02:58,889
I'll buy candles too because people complain.

1844
03:03:03,659 --> 03:03:04,700
They're annoyingly.

1845
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:13,989
Where are they?

1846
03:03:13,989 --> 03:03:14,870
Cobweb.

1847
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:19,690
Where are the candles?

1848
03:03:20,250 --> 03:03:24,309
There you go.

1849
03:03:24,309 --> 03:03:33,959
I think alcohol is your next big merch idea.

1850
03:03:39,239 --> 03:03:39,879
No.

1851
03:03:39,879 --> 03:03:51,030
What are the quests right now?

1852
03:03:51,030 --> 03:03:54,540
Calendar.

1853
03:03:54,540 --> 03:03:56,469
It's the only thing I have.

1854
03:03:56,469 --> 03:04:09,989
I want a large table.

1855
03:04:12,649 --> 03:04:15,559
I need another bench.

1856
03:04:15,559 --> 03:04:24,969
Another bench.

1857
03:04:26,729 --> 03:04:30,149
And then I want to make this really, really good.

1858
03:04:30,149 --> 03:04:40,860
Do you have water?

1859
03:04:40,860 --> 03:04:53,639
OK, now I'm going to go to bed.

1860
03:04:53,639 --> 03:04:56,440
I might reload the game so people don't think it's always 3 a.m.

1861
03:04:56,440 --> 03:05:02,340
I don't like title screen.

1862
03:05:19,110 --> 03:05:32,950
Barley flower.

1863
03:05:32,950 --> 03:05:34,870
I have to probably level up or something.

1864
03:05:34,870 --> 03:05:40,120
I'm going to get my delivery and make some beer.

1865
03:05:52,340 --> 03:05:54,040
Craft up some beer.

1866
03:05:54,040 --> 03:05:55,319
Go to bed again.

1867
03:05:55,319 --> 03:06:03,260
OK, mead.

1868
03:06:04,629 --> 03:06:09,399
I want dual hops, aroma hops, and bitter hops.

1869
03:06:09,399 --> 03:06:12,280
I want this thing to be just all over the place.

1870
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:52,899
I want people to take a sip out of this and go bananas, barley seeds, rye.

1871
03:06:52,899 --> 03:06:54,100
Should I do rye?

1872
03:06:54,100 --> 03:06:55,530
Hold on.

1873
03:06:55,530 --> 03:06:57,719
What's in the tree here?

1874
03:06:57,719 --> 03:07:04,360
This is white wine juice, white wine, white grape must, red wine juice, red wine.

1875
03:07:05,079 --> 03:07:08,299
I need one more blue.

1876
03:07:08,860 --> 03:07:11,399
OK, so this is wheat.

1877
03:07:11,959 --> 03:07:13,879
Wheat, rye, and cider.

1878
03:07:13,879 --> 03:07:17,379
Let me be able to make wheat beer.

1879
03:07:18,309 --> 03:07:22,739
I'm going to buy a bunch of wheat and plant it.

1880
03:07:22,739 --> 03:07:27,500
What was it?

1881
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:28,299
Forty?

1882
03:07:28,299 --> 03:07:31,239
This stuff is cheap.

1883
03:07:42,090 --> 03:07:43,610
Shrimp and white wine.

1884
03:07:44,170 --> 03:07:58,340
Guys, remember, isn't there a scene where Tim and Eric are in the hospital or something

1885
03:07:58,340 --> 03:07:59,700
and the doctor comes in and he's like,

1886
03:07:59,700 --> 03:08:02,579
I just want to say we're really, really getting concerned about your white wine levels.

1887
03:08:02,579 --> 03:08:04,819
We want to bring those up to make sure they match the shrimp levels.

1888
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:10,379
That was so funny.

1889
03:08:10,379 --> 03:08:13,219
Yeah, we're getting really concerned here.

1890
03:08:13,860 --> 03:08:15,940
Because they don't they like eat too much shrimp or something

1891
03:08:15,940 --> 03:08:18,500
and it's like, oh, wait, wait, sorry, we want to make sure we get you.

1892
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:19,860
But we got to get your white wine levels up.

1893
03:08:19,860 --> 03:08:30,680
They're kind of talking as if it's like plasma or something or like white blood or red blood count.

1894
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:35,940
Tim and Eric really did set the stage for that kind of humor.

1895
03:08:35,940 --> 03:08:41,000
I think they really kind of set the bar on a lot of that stuff in a way.

1896
03:08:41,559 --> 03:08:47,239
All right, I want my stuff.

1897
03:08:51,639 --> 03:08:52,600
Deliver it.

1898
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:53,719
I want a plant.

1899
03:08:53,719 --> 03:09:02,120
I'm just going to sleep.

1900
03:09:02,680 --> 03:09:03,719
I'm going to go sleep.

1901
03:09:03,719 --> 03:09:06,760
Wake up and be ready to start the day.

1902
03:09:06,760 --> 03:09:15,139
I could go collect resources, but now I'm going to bed.

1903
03:09:27,209 --> 03:09:28,889
Twenty two hour nap.

1904
03:09:28,889 --> 03:09:44,979
Stuff like Steve rule to just kind of funny.

1905
03:09:44,979 --> 03:09:49,459
I have not kept up with any of those people or shows or anything really at all.

1906
03:09:49,459 --> 03:09:55,750
I remember like 10, 15 years ago, it was kind of like they were really

1907
03:09:56,469 --> 03:09:57,670
especially like 15 years ago.

1908
03:09:58,309 --> 03:10:13,770
All right, let's begin the process.

1909
03:10:13,770 --> 03:10:14,969
I want my deliveries.

1910
03:10:14,969 --> 03:10:28,899
This inventory is disgusting.

1911
03:10:28,899 --> 03:10:29,379
I hate it.

1912
03:10:30,100 --> 03:10:30,979
I need to clean this up.

1913
03:10:30,979 --> 03:10:32,020
It's just it's so messy.

1914
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:34,739
I need to get I need to get my act together here.

1915
03:10:35,540 --> 03:10:54,860
There's no watering, right?

1916
03:10:54,860 --> 03:10:57,379
I feel like this could be a problem.

1917
03:10:57,379 --> 03:11:12,250
Here we go.

1918
03:11:12,250 --> 03:11:12,729
All right.

1919
03:11:12,729 --> 03:11:20,139
How do I get the cat to like me more?

1920
03:11:20,139 --> 03:11:22,500
I need water.

1921
03:11:22,500 --> 03:11:41,829
There we go.

1922
03:11:41,829 --> 03:11:44,540
All right, let's fill the tap.

1923
03:11:44,540 --> 03:11:55,159
This one is going to have two different brews, don't I?

1924
03:11:55,159 --> 03:11:58,170
No, I didn't start making it yet.

1925
03:11:58,170 --> 03:11:58,729
One's fine.

1926
03:11:58,729 --> 03:12:00,010
It's the one I wanted to buy anyways.

1927
03:12:00,010 --> 03:12:02,229
I think it's all right.

1928
03:12:02,229 --> 03:12:13,479
Can I make any new food?

1929
03:12:13,479 --> 03:12:18,219
Spend your experience upgrades for your character.

1930
03:12:18,219 --> 03:12:21,370
Cleaning speed increase.

1931
03:12:21,370 --> 03:12:23,450
Better bargaining, better price.

1932
03:12:23,450 --> 03:12:24,809
Yeah, that for sure.

1933
03:12:30,120 --> 03:12:30,520
Everything.

1934
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:41,540
Yeah, better price, better price and faster cleaning.

1935
03:12:41,540 --> 03:12:53,500
Don't forget about the bench.

1936
03:12:53,500 --> 03:12:54,299
That's true.

1937
03:12:54,299 --> 03:13:02,469
I'll try not to feed the cat, feed the cat, feed the cat.

1938
03:13:04,889 --> 03:13:12,819
I swear I don't think you can.

1939
03:13:12,819 --> 03:13:15,899
Planks as the bench.

1940
03:13:15,899 --> 03:13:19,290
All right, now I'm going to make a birdhouse.

1941
03:13:19,290 --> 03:13:21,079
So I'm going to wait for these planks to get done

1942
03:13:21,079 --> 03:13:22,760
and I'm going to just build a birdhouse because why not?

1943
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:41,670
The bird in here.

1944
03:13:41,670 --> 03:13:46,600
I've seen that make the rounds again.

1945
03:13:48,540 --> 03:13:50,059
Oh, there's a bird in here thing.

1946
03:13:54,069 --> 03:13:56,389
I've seen that people have been sharing it recently.

1947
03:13:56,469 --> 03:14:06,120
A gift of you eating the bird is the first time I ever saw you.

1948
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:09,860
Well, thanks for hanging out.

1949
03:14:09,860 --> 03:14:18,659
This is expensive, but I'm going to build it.

1950
03:14:18,659 --> 03:14:25,860
Do we get to have bird friends?

1951
03:14:25,860 --> 03:14:27,219
Do I still have that birdhouse?

1952
03:14:29,559 --> 03:14:30,280
Maybe.

1953
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:35,780
Might be in a box somewhere.

1954
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:39,940
I hold on to a lot of stuff, especially stream stuff.

1955
03:14:39,940 --> 03:14:45,479
I mean, that Reddit shelf, I know is a joke.

1956
03:14:46,040 --> 03:14:49,700
Kind of nice to just remember things that you've done.

1957
03:14:51,020 --> 03:14:52,379
Like, oh yeah, I remember that.

1958
03:14:54,979 --> 03:14:56,340
Like a little token.

1959
03:14:56,979 --> 03:15:00,280
I think I'm pretty sure I still have it.

1960
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:01,000
I think it's in a box.

1961
03:15:01,559 --> 03:15:17,590
All right, where do we put the birdhouse?

1962
03:15:17,829 --> 03:15:27,940
Maybe they hang out right here?

1963
03:15:27,940 --> 03:15:29,459
Away from the foot traffic.

1964
03:15:29,459 --> 03:15:31,180
We don't want to scare them.

1965
03:15:31,180 --> 03:15:44,979
How about hanging out by the wheat closer to the window?

1966
03:15:45,540 --> 03:15:49,590
I think back here is all right.

1967
03:15:50,149 --> 03:15:51,430
No, that's too loud.

1968
03:15:51,430 --> 03:15:52,229
Too many sounds.

1969
03:15:53,030 --> 03:15:54,229
I think back here is fine.

1970
03:15:54,229 --> 03:15:54,629
Right here.

1971
03:15:55,270 --> 03:15:58,200
Behind the well.

1972
03:15:59,350 --> 03:16:01,180
Yeah, right here.

1973
03:16:02,139 --> 03:16:04,260
Okay, there it is.

1974
03:16:04,899 --> 03:16:10,700
Now we just wait.

1975
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:30,469
Okay, I got my new bench.

1976
03:16:31,110 --> 03:16:33,909
Should I make another table?

1977
03:16:33,909 --> 03:16:37,239
I'll just say no.

1978
03:16:37,879 --> 03:16:44,100
All right, soup, bread.

1979
03:16:44,899 --> 03:16:48,440
Maybe I should make a roasted chicken.

1980
03:16:49,079 --> 03:16:50,899
Maybe that's a good idea.

1981
03:16:51,860 --> 03:16:52,979
I could do any one of these right now.

1982
03:16:53,930 --> 03:16:59,860
Soup, try to go down sausage.

1983
03:16:59,860 --> 03:17:04,899
All right, I could make roast fish, roast chicken, roast beef, roast pork, roast barley.

1984
03:17:04,899 --> 03:17:09,940
I can make roasted barley.

1985
03:17:09,940 --> 03:17:18,520
Maybe I'll do that now.

1986
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:21,399
I want to cultivate the wheat because I want to make a wheat beer.

1987
03:17:21,399 --> 03:17:35,399
All right, when I go to bed and wake up, we're doing a resource day.

1988
03:17:35,399 --> 03:17:40,549
And then I will make my two beers and then I'm going to open the store.

1989
03:17:45,479 --> 03:17:47,079
Roast chicken sounds delicious.

1990
03:17:47,079 --> 03:17:55,860
It does, it does.

1991
03:17:55,860 --> 03:18:00,540
You like ketchup and grilled cheese?

1992
03:18:00,540 --> 03:18:12,010
Yeah, it's good.

1993
03:18:12,010 --> 03:18:21,639
Okay, let me see.

1994
03:18:21,639 --> 03:18:23,079
It probably takes a few days.

1995
03:18:23,079 --> 03:18:29,209
Stardew Valley and some of this stuff takes a long time.

1996
03:18:29,209 --> 03:18:30,969
I imagine it's probably only a day or two.

1997
03:18:30,969 --> 03:18:33,100
All right, resource time.

1998
03:18:33,100 --> 03:18:43,500
What's the worst thing to put on a steak?

1999
03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:49,219
I don't know.

2000
03:18:49,219 --> 03:18:58,819
Do you mean a steak that's cooked on the grill, not a steak sandwich?

2001
03:18:58,819 --> 03:19:08,600
I think the easiest answer is not very many condiments.

2002
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:10,680
I don't think it would go well on a steak.

2003
03:19:10,680 --> 03:19:18,629
I don't eat very much steak, but I can't imagine everybody.

2004
03:19:18,629 --> 03:19:23,420
I mean, I like mushrooms, mushrooms on a steak, onions on a steak.

2005
03:19:24,139 --> 03:19:27,590
Steak and eggs is really good from what I remember.

2006
03:19:27,590 --> 03:19:29,030
I remember being like, oh, yeah, that's great.

2007
03:19:30,629 --> 03:19:36,170
I think an egg is great right now, doesn't it?

2008
03:19:36,729 --> 03:19:51,930
From what you remember, I haven't had it in a long time.

2009
03:19:52,569 --> 03:20:07,159
Steak is nasty.

2010
03:20:10,620 --> 03:20:13,819
I mean, look, I could sit, I would sit here and agree with you.

2011
03:20:13,819 --> 03:20:18,520
I would sit here and say, yeah, you're right, but I would be full of shit.

2012
03:20:23,459 --> 03:20:25,860
I like steak and cheese subs and sandwiches.

2013
03:20:27,299 --> 03:20:29,479
I like them.

2014
03:20:29,479 --> 03:20:34,700
Hamburger, all right, like that's essentially beef.

2015
03:20:40,340 --> 03:20:44,979
The idea of a big meaty steak, though, is not appetizing to me.

2016
03:20:44,979 --> 03:20:49,340
I'm like, yeah, no, no, thank you.

2017
03:20:49,340 --> 03:20:53,579
Steak to me is a rare thing that happens every so often, sometimes.

2018
03:20:59,079 --> 03:21:04,629
Me having a steak, a steak steak, that fork and knife steak,

2019
03:21:04,629 --> 03:21:06,469
it's probably realistically only,

2020
03:21:07,590 --> 03:21:10,149
and people are going to be like, what the fuck is going on over here?

2021
03:21:10,149 --> 03:21:12,149
It's probably realistically only a few times a year.

2022
03:21:12,149 --> 03:21:18,520
A fork and knife steak is only a few times a year for me.

2023
03:21:18,520 --> 03:21:23,129
With that being said, I eat hamburgers all the time.

2024
03:21:23,129 --> 03:21:26,950
I eat beef, I mean, frequently.

2025
03:21:26,950 --> 03:21:31,670
I love carne asada tacos, but I'm not really a big fan

2026
03:21:31,670 --> 03:21:33,750
of just the steak with a fork and knife on a plate.

2027
03:21:34,469 --> 03:21:35,829
Never really did it for me anyways.

2028
03:21:43,670 --> 03:21:52,180
Okay, so now I can buy that calendar that wants me to, a specific quest.

2029
03:21:52,819 --> 03:22:01,530
Hey, it got cheaper.

2030
03:22:01,530 --> 03:22:12,360
Oops, what is that reward?

2031
03:22:16,149 --> 03:22:19,510
A lot of shit steak opinions being thrown around in here.

2032
03:22:20,469 --> 03:22:26,090
Yeah, I mean, well, to be fair, there are 15,000 people here.

2033
03:22:26,090 --> 03:22:28,329
Who knows what everybody's diet looks like.

2034
03:22:29,049 --> 03:22:30,969
You got a pretty large sample of people here.

2035
03:22:31,530 --> 03:22:44,899
I feel like there's lots of opinions with the 15,000 people.

2036
03:22:44,899 --> 03:22:54,229
How do you like your steak cooked?

2037
03:22:54,229 --> 03:22:58,760
Whatever, I'll just get like a thousand on followers.

2038
03:22:58,760 --> 03:22:59,479
That's just whatever.

2039
03:23:01,350 --> 03:23:07,909
I like steak, I will say medium in a restaurant setting.

2040
03:23:07,909 --> 03:23:10,950
I will say medium, and then I'll kind of, I'll put my hand up.

2041
03:23:11,670 --> 03:23:12,709
I'll say, I'll take medium.

2042
03:23:13,750 --> 03:23:16,469
And then the waiter's definitely like, all right, here it comes.

2043
03:23:17,639 --> 03:23:21,479
Medium, well, medium, like I order a steak medium at a restaurant

2044
03:23:21,479 --> 03:23:23,860
because I think that's how you do it.

2045
03:23:24,579 --> 03:23:28,739
But for me personally, I prefer not medium well.

2046
03:23:29,459 --> 03:23:40,729
I wish there was another tier because there is well done, medium well, medium.

2047
03:23:40,729 --> 03:23:45,129
I like the in between, between medium and medium well.

2048
03:23:45,690 --> 03:23:49,959
You know what I mean?

2049
03:23:49,959 --> 03:23:53,479
I like that area in between medium to the second tier.

2050
03:23:56,760 --> 03:23:58,680
I like, I don't like it any other way, really.

2051
03:24:03,020 --> 03:24:08,180
Medium rare to me is just not, just no thanks.

2052
03:24:08,180 --> 03:24:10,020
And rare, no.

2053
03:24:10,739 --> 03:24:13,450
You want the non-centrist take?

2054
03:24:14,170 --> 03:24:17,020
Fine, take a stance, Andy.

2055
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:18,219
Take a stance, Andy.

2056
03:24:19,659 --> 03:24:21,500
That term doesn't even make sense right now.

2057
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:23,020
I don't even know why I keep saying that term.

2058
03:24:23,579 --> 03:24:25,209
You want me to take a stance?

2059
03:24:25,209 --> 03:24:27,750
I think rare steak is fucking disgusting.

2060
03:24:27,750 --> 03:24:28,469
There you go.

2061
03:24:28,549 --> 03:24:30,629
I just think rare steak is gross.

2062
03:24:30,629 --> 03:24:31,430
I'm sorry.

2063
03:24:31,430 --> 03:24:36,219
That's just the way I felt since I was a kid all the way through my teenage years.

2064
03:24:36,219 --> 03:24:40,409
Rare steak I think is not, it's unappetizing to me.

2065
03:24:41,139 --> 03:24:46,020
Medium rare, medium rare on the other hand is like, okay, I get you, I get you.

2066
03:24:46,579 --> 03:24:50,629
Rare, I do not find it to be appetizing at all.

2067
03:24:50,629 --> 03:24:53,290
There's you, fine, I took a stance, finally.

2068
03:24:53,290 --> 03:24:58,760
Took me 13 years of doing YouTube and Twitch

2069
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:01,770
before you got a real fucking take from me.

2070
03:25:01,770 --> 03:25:03,209
Rare steak is disgusting.

2071
03:25:03,209 --> 03:25:05,590
Took you 13 years.

2072
03:25:05,590 --> 03:25:06,709
You finally got something out of me.

2073
03:25:14,100 --> 03:25:15,620
He's so brave.

2074
03:25:18,440 --> 03:25:20,360
All right, let me go back.

2075
03:25:20,360 --> 03:25:21,719
Let me, oh, I got deliveries.

2076
03:25:33,399 --> 03:25:35,319
Show the, hold on, I'll show this.

2077
03:25:35,319 --> 03:25:40,059
All right, I'm gonna show meat on, okay, let me show some steak

2078
03:25:40,059 --> 03:25:41,579
where I would say I like it.

2079
03:25:41,579 --> 03:25:56,100
Not a bad idea.

2080
03:25:56,100 --> 03:25:58,180
Stages of steak doneness.

2081
03:25:58,180 --> 03:26:02,979
All right, let's put this on camera.

2082
03:26:08,870 --> 03:26:17,940
Right, okay, so yeah, medium, medium to medium well I think is perfect.

2083
03:26:18,180 --> 03:26:23,159
Anything under blue, like blue rare, uh-uh.

2084
03:26:23,159 --> 03:26:26,629
No, medium is, I think medium's where it's at.

2085
03:26:26,629 --> 03:26:28,229
I understand medium rare.

2086
03:26:28,229 --> 03:26:32,280
I like medium, medium to medium well.

2087
03:26:32,280 --> 03:26:36,120
And honestly, I will try to cook my own steaks to be medium

2088
03:26:36,120 --> 03:26:37,579
but I get a little paranoid

2089
03:26:37,579 --> 03:26:40,059
and I end up making it medium well almost accidentally.

2090
03:26:43,219 --> 03:26:45,700
Medium is fine, medium's perfectly fine.

2091
03:26:48,309 --> 03:26:51,059
If you ordered a medium rare steak

2092
03:26:51,059 --> 03:26:52,739
and I was sitting next to you at a restaurant,

2093
03:26:52,739 --> 03:26:56,889
I would say, nice dude, cool, that sounds good.

2094
03:26:56,889 --> 03:26:58,889
But I would not order a rare steak.

2095
03:27:00,069 --> 03:27:01,670
No, I just don't like it.

2096
03:27:01,670 --> 03:27:08,469
If you ordered a rare steak and I was sitting at a restaurant,

2097
03:27:08,469 --> 03:27:13,290
I'd be like, ooh, okay, all right, rare, rare steak, all right.

2098
03:27:14,920 --> 03:27:21,420
Damn, really, rare.

2099
03:27:21,420 --> 03:27:23,260
I've had blue rare before.

2100
03:27:23,260 --> 03:27:25,930
Blue rare steak is seared on the outside

2101
03:27:25,930 --> 03:27:28,010
almost entirely raw or uncooked in the middle.

2102
03:27:28,649 --> 03:27:31,139
Called very rare or blood rare.

2103
03:27:31,940 --> 03:27:33,860
In contrast, rare steak is cooked longer

2104
03:27:33,860 --> 03:27:35,620
so the middle is warm but still very red

2105
03:27:35,620 --> 03:27:37,700
without melting the fat in the meat.

2106
03:27:41,209 --> 03:27:51,079
I'm curious, yeah, be honest, what do you actually prefer?

2107
03:27:51,079 --> 03:27:52,360
Yeah, I don't know if I want my steak

2108
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:55,479
to be classified as blue, right?

2109
03:27:55,479 --> 03:27:56,680
How would you like your steak?

2110
03:27:56,680 --> 03:27:59,500
I'll take blue, please.

2111
03:27:59,500 --> 03:28:04,739
I don't want it to be a, can it be a steak?

2112
03:28:04,739 --> 03:28:07,780
Blue rare is safe to eat.

2113
03:28:07,780 --> 03:28:12,649
I mean, I'm not arguing if you should or shouldn't.

2114
03:28:12,649 --> 03:28:15,530
I'm just saying I do not find it to be appetizing.

2115
03:28:21,850 --> 03:28:28,920
Blue, is there an option for steak is boring?

2116
03:28:29,579 --> 03:28:37,000
Um, yeah, I just wouldn't answer it.

2117
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:38,520
Medium, a lot of medium rares.

2118
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:39,959
A lot of medium friends though.

2119
03:28:39,959 --> 03:28:45,819
I'm seeing a lot of medium friends in here.

2120
03:28:45,819 --> 03:28:48,700
Okay, so for all you medium rare enjoyers,

2121
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:50,700
if you were at the restaurant

2122
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:53,659
and somebody orders a medium steak next to you,

2123
03:28:53,659 --> 03:28:54,379
you're cool with that.

2124
03:28:54,379 --> 03:28:55,260
That's cool to you.

2125
03:28:55,260 --> 03:29:01,020
It's like, yeah, of course, that's fine.

2126
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:02,379
Yeah, of course.

2127
03:29:02,379 --> 03:29:10,090
What about medium well?

2128
03:29:10,090 --> 03:29:11,129
Medium well is fine.

2129
03:29:11,129 --> 03:29:11,850
Hey, how about this?

2130
03:29:11,850 --> 03:29:14,170
Let people eat the food they fucking wanna eat.

2131
03:29:14,170 --> 03:29:21,530
How does that sound?

2132
03:29:21,530 --> 03:29:24,250
Even if somebody ordered a blue rare steak

2133
03:29:24,250 --> 03:29:25,610
and I was sitting at the restaurant,

2134
03:29:26,250 --> 03:29:27,530
I would internally be like,

2135
03:29:27,530 --> 03:29:28,809
holy shit, wow, that's,

2136
03:29:28,809 --> 03:29:30,010
I've never happened to hear very many people

2137
03:29:30,010 --> 03:29:31,290
order like that before.

2138
03:29:31,290 --> 03:29:33,590
But I'm not gonna be like,

2139
03:29:33,590 --> 03:29:36,950
oh, what the hell, what the fuck, dude?

2140
03:29:36,950 --> 03:29:38,969
No, you like it, eat it.

2141
03:29:38,969 --> 03:29:40,090
Hopefully you enjoy it.

2142
03:29:40,090 --> 03:29:47,370
50% say medium rare.

2143
03:29:47,370 --> 03:29:53,979
That's actually pretty,

2144
03:29:53,979 --> 03:29:55,340
that's really interesting to me.

2145
03:29:55,340 --> 03:30:01,110
All right, any more quests?

2146
03:30:01,110 --> 03:30:04,780
No, time to open the store.

2147
03:30:04,780 --> 03:30:11,219
I'm gonna make some money.

2148
03:30:11,219 --> 03:30:17,399
Only 8% for well done.

2149
03:30:17,399 --> 03:30:20,280
There's a couple of important distinctions to make.

2150
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:25,079
I think with well done,

2151
03:30:25,079 --> 03:30:30,010
I wouldn't order a cheese steak with rare steak in it.

2152
03:30:30,010 --> 03:30:30,729
I wouldn't.

2153
03:30:30,729 --> 03:30:33,370
I think there's a different flavor profile there.

2154
03:30:33,370 --> 03:30:45,190
Does that make sense?

2155
03:30:45,190 --> 03:30:47,989
I think that most cheese steaks to me need to be

2156
03:30:48,549 --> 03:30:50,229
at least medium to medium well.

2157
03:30:50,229 --> 03:30:51,829
It depends on the cut of meat.

2158
03:30:51,829 --> 03:30:52,629
Yeah, exactly.

2159
03:30:53,190 --> 03:30:57,719
We're talking steak as in the cut, yeah.

2160
03:30:57,719 --> 03:31:03,260
We really do only talk about food.

2161
03:31:03,260 --> 03:31:07,899
If you put together every single moment

2162
03:31:07,899 --> 03:31:08,860
I've been on stream,

2163
03:31:09,819 --> 03:31:13,979
you could probably extract 30 full seasons

2164
03:31:14,700 --> 03:31:16,219
of a food podcast out of it.

2165
03:31:19,049 --> 03:31:19,930
Cook it with Jerma.

2166
03:31:20,489 --> 03:31:26,469
It would probably last like 30 straight seasons

2167
03:31:26,469 --> 03:31:28,549
if you just took the food conversations.

2168
03:31:28,549 --> 03:31:34,360
What do you think?

2169
03:31:34,360 --> 03:31:35,000
What is that?

2170
03:31:35,719 --> 03:31:41,700
It's like a refinery or something.

2171
03:31:41,700 --> 03:31:42,659
What is this?

2172
03:31:42,659 --> 03:31:49,129
Stone block?

2173
03:31:49,129 --> 03:31:50,090
Polished stone.

2174
03:31:52,790 --> 03:31:55,930
Okay, I don't need fuel.

2175
03:32:03,579 --> 03:32:05,500
All right, time to open the store.

2176
03:32:05,500 --> 03:32:13,159
We got plenty of beer.

2177
03:32:13,959 --> 03:32:22,149
I got my new concoction open.

2178
03:32:22,149 --> 03:32:22,649
Candles.

2179
03:32:25,770 --> 03:32:28,010
I can place them during the game day.

2180
03:32:28,010 --> 03:32:34,860
Hold on.

2181
03:32:34,860 --> 03:32:38,389
I'm just making it nice.

2182
03:32:38,389 --> 03:32:38,870
Hold on.

2183
03:32:39,799 --> 03:32:41,239
I know everyone's excited for gruel.

2184
03:32:55,620 --> 03:32:56,420
How much did it cost?

2185
03:32:56,979 --> 03:32:57,620
150?

2186
03:32:59,639 --> 03:33:03,670
I feel like that's not that much.

2187
03:33:03,670 --> 03:33:04,309
That kind of suck.

2188
03:33:05,510 --> 03:33:06,840
I feel like that kind of sucks.

2189
03:33:18,700 --> 03:33:19,579
Places bollocks.

2190
03:33:20,219 --> 03:33:28,389
Get out of here.

2191
03:33:28,389 --> 03:33:39,319
How do I put this in here?

2192
03:33:42,819 --> 03:33:43,860
I don't know.

2193
03:33:43,860 --> 03:33:53,639
That was a blue rare enjoyer.

2194
03:33:59,030 --> 03:33:59,590
Too hot?

2195
03:33:59,590 --> 03:33:59,989
Sorry.

2196
03:34:01,899 --> 03:34:11,020
It's filthy shit.

2197
03:34:11,579 --> 03:34:31,000
I need some better food.

2198
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:36,649
The food is where you make all the money.

2199
03:34:36,649 --> 03:34:37,209
Yeah.

2200
03:34:37,209 --> 03:34:39,770
I was selling those porridges for what?

2201
03:34:39,770 --> 03:34:41,129
Two silver?

2202
03:34:41,129 --> 03:35:00,569
Can we have this be a poll stream?

2203
03:35:00,569 --> 03:35:03,379
Or just ask questions and poll the chat?

2204
03:35:04,729 --> 03:35:05,229
Yeah.

2205
03:35:13,780 --> 03:35:30,729
It's a good way to farm viewer engagement.

2206
03:35:30,729 --> 03:35:32,090
These drinks are watered down.

2207
03:35:32,729 --> 03:35:34,100
I don't like the beer.

2208
03:35:34,100 --> 03:35:38,200
It's a good way for viewer engagement.

2209
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:40,000
Yeah.

2210
03:35:41,079 --> 03:35:44,200
But I mean, I don't have to engage you guys 24-7 here.

2211
03:35:53,129 --> 03:35:53,930
More polls.

2212
03:35:54,569 --> 03:35:54,729
All right.

2213
03:35:54,729 --> 03:35:55,610
How about the poll with this?

2214
03:35:56,870 --> 03:35:57,370
It's your...

2215
03:36:07,129 --> 03:36:07,930
How is this for a poll?

2216
03:36:28,489 --> 03:36:33,639
Coca-Cola tastes better out of an aluminum can or a glass bottle.

2217
03:36:33,639 --> 03:36:34,440
Run that one, I guess.

2218
03:36:34,440 --> 03:36:35,319
I don't know.

2219
03:36:35,319 --> 03:37:04,219
I have a pros and cons for either one.

2220
03:37:04,219 --> 03:37:10,700
Coca-Cola or any soda out of an aluminum can to me can be somehow is colder.

2221
03:37:11,420 --> 03:37:15,049
Be like anytime I've had any soda out of a glass bottle.

2222
03:37:15,610 --> 03:37:17,610
It's been the preferred way for me.

2223
03:37:17,610 --> 03:37:20,170
But it almost feels like it's not as cold somehow.

2224
03:37:21,959 --> 03:37:23,719
Even if you get it to a point where it's nice and cold,

2225
03:37:23,719 --> 03:37:29,319
it's not quite as frosty chilled as a freezing aluminum can.

2226
03:37:29,319 --> 03:37:29,879
I don't know why.

2227
03:37:41,879 --> 03:37:43,159
And Coke is crispy.

2228
03:37:43,879 --> 03:37:49,979
It's funny.

2229
03:37:49,979 --> 03:37:50,379
I actually...

2230
03:37:51,559 --> 03:37:58,500
My favorite way to have a soda like that is in a cooler covered in ice.

2231
03:37:59,219 --> 03:38:00,620
It's buried.

2232
03:38:01,180 --> 03:38:05,420
You have to dig in and actually pull that shit out of the ice from the cooler.

2233
03:38:05,420 --> 03:38:08,700
And it's an aluminum can and that shit is freezing.

2234
03:38:09,340 --> 03:38:13,260
And it is just boom and it makes that exploding sound, right?

2235
03:38:15,100 --> 03:38:17,479
And it's just so cold and so perfect on a summer day.

2236
03:38:18,120 --> 03:38:19,530
There you go.

2237
03:38:19,530 --> 03:38:22,729
Add this to the food podcast playlist.

2238
03:38:22,729 --> 03:38:36,100
When I run out of this beer, well, we're closed.

2239
03:38:36,659 --> 03:38:51,110
Chill your Coke in glasses.

2240
03:38:52,659 --> 03:38:53,940
I do prefer...

2241
03:38:53,940 --> 03:38:55,620
I actually like it out of a glass container.

2242
03:38:57,780 --> 03:39:03,530
And I probably agree with that, but sometimes you can't beat the can.

2243
03:39:04,250 --> 03:39:08,940
You know what I really prefer in the aluminum can?

2244
03:39:08,940 --> 03:39:10,139
Oh, man.

2245
03:39:10,139 --> 03:39:11,100
And it's honestly...

2246
03:39:12,379 --> 03:39:13,659
You want a food take here?

2247
03:39:14,299 --> 03:39:15,340
It's only gotten better.

2248
03:39:16,059 --> 03:39:17,420
It's just gotten better.

2249
03:39:20,579 --> 03:39:22,100
Brisk iced tea out of the can.

2250
03:39:22,100 --> 03:39:24,579
It's only gotten better as we've gone forward here.

2251
03:39:38,360 --> 03:39:40,840
A nice freezing cold brisk iced tea.

2252
03:39:41,399 --> 03:39:44,819
It's actually really bad because anytime I've had brisk iced tea,

2253
03:39:45,379 --> 03:39:46,260
why is it like this?

2254
03:39:51,020 --> 03:39:53,020
I feel like when I open a can of brisk iced tea,

2255
03:39:53,500 --> 03:39:55,100
I have to go like...

2256
03:39:57,340 --> 03:39:58,620
And half the can's gone.

2257
03:39:58,620 --> 03:40:02,620
It's almost like that's what you do when you open one of those.

2258
03:40:02,620 --> 03:40:05,799
And it's just...

2259
03:40:06,680 --> 03:40:10,680
In almost two or three moments, you look at it and go, wait a minute.

2260
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:12,680
I just opened this fucking thing.

2261
03:40:13,239 --> 03:40:17,420
Yeah, to me, a brisk iced tea is...

2262
03:40:19,979 --> 03:40:21,260
You are sweating.

2263
03:40:21,260 --> 03:40:22,059
It's hot out.

2264
03:40:22,870 --> 03:40:24,229
It is really, really...

2265
03:40:24,229 --> 03:40:25,430
Wow, the sun is...

2266
03:40:25,430 --> 03:40:27,350
I'm wiping the sweat off my brow.

2267
03:40:27,899 --> 03:40:28,459
Boom.

2268
03:40:28,459 --> 03:40:33,479
Ice cold brisk iced tea smash, slam that shit.

2269
03:40:33,479 --> 03:40:35,239
That's to me how that works.

2270
03:40:35,239 --> 03:40:40,329
That's one of the number one ways to enjoy that.

2271
03:40:40,329 --> 03:40:42,389
What are you talking about?

2272
03:40:42,389 --> 03:40:43,909
I'm talking about brisk iced tea.

2273
03:40:43,909 --> 03:40:44,870
You never had it?

2274
03:40:44,870 --> 03:40:58,729
All right, I want to do wheat.

2275
03:40:58,729 --> 03:41:00,469
The wheat will probably be ready tomorrow.

2276
03:41:00,469 --> 03:41:08,620
This is surprising to me too.

2277
03:41:08,620 --> 03:41:09,100
Let me see.

2278
03:41:09,100 --> 03:41:11,420
I want to make sure I don't say this wrong.

2279
03:41:11,420 --> 03:41:16,069
I was actually surprised.

2280
03:41:16,069 --> 03:41:21,049
Last time I had brisk iced tea was kind of not a long time ago,

2281
03:41:21,049 --> 03:41:33,270
but I feel like it was a lot less sugar than I thought was in the can.

2282
03:41:33,430 --> 03:41:38,219
Because like a bottle of...

2283
03:41:38,219 --> 03:41:38,860
Oh, not a bottle.

2284
03:41:38,860 --> 03:41:40,540
Like a can of Coke is what?

2285
03:41:40,540 --> 03:41:44,100
30 something grams of sugar.

2286
03:41:44,100 --> 03:41:46,819
I want to say it's under 20 for a brisk iced tea.

2287
03:41:46,819 --> 03:41:51,670
And I remember looking at that and going, wait a minute, really?

2288
03:41:51,670 --> 03:41:52,709
That's kind of surprising.

2289
03:42:02,540 --> 03:42:03,670
Let's look this up.

2290
03:42:03,670 --> 03:42:05,110
Brisk iced tea like sugar.

2291
03:42:05,110 --> 03:42:15,530
I promise you it was like surprising in a 12 ounce can.

2292
03:42:15,530 --> 03:42:17,750
Well, not 12 ounce can.

2293
03:42:17,750 --> 03:42:28,819
I remember looking at it.

2294
03:42:28,819 --> 03:42:29,459
Is this accurate?

2295
03:42:29,459 --> 03:42:35,399
I don't think that's accurate.

2296
03:42:35,399 --> 03:42:35,959
20 grams?

2297
03:42:35,959 --> 03:42:39,430
17 grams?

2298
03:42:39,430 --> 03:42:43,020
17 grams is in the can apparently.

2299
03:42:43,739 --> 03:42:44,620
I mean, it's a lot of sugar.

2300
03:42:44,620 --> 03:42:55,510
It still is, but it's not like 30 plus.

2301
03:42:55,510 --> 03:42:57,350
17 grams Coke is 39.

2302
03:42:57,350 --> 03:43:02,250
Yeah.

2303
03:43:02,250 --> 03:43:03,049
Hey, look.

2304
03:43:03,049 --> 03:43:04,409
Is this ready?

2305
03:43:04,409 --> 03:43:18,629
I thought I just ruined everything.

2306
03:43:18,629 --> 03:43:22,649
Wet socks for 24 hours or no underwear for a week?

2307
03:43:22,649 --> 03:43:25,290
I mean, that's a no brainer to me.

2308
03:43:25,290 --> 03:43:26,010
I could hand...

2309
03:43:26,010 --> 03:43:26,329
I don't...

2310
03:43:26,329 --> 03:43:27,129
Actually, wait a minute.

2311
03:43:27,129 --> 03:43:33,239
I thought that was...

2312
03:43:40,280 --> 03:43:41,000
Actually, I don't know.

2313
03:43:44,200 --> 03:43:47,909
Yeah, maybe I would just maybe pick the no underwear for a week.

2314
03:43:47,909 --> 03:43:50,250
It does not go anywhere.

2315
03:43:50,250 --> 03:43:53,129
And just stay here and fucking leave.

2316
03:44:04,520 --> 03:44:08,920
Malted wheat.

2317
03:44:08,920 --> 03:44:10,040
Wheat flour.

2318
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:22,549
Just wear pajamas for a week.

2319
03:44:22,549 --> 03:44:24,489
Yeah, that makes sense.

2320
03:44:24,489 --> 03:44:28,440
Oh, you like me.

2321
03:44:28,440 --> 03:44:31,559
Roasted barley.

2322
03:44:31,559 --> 03:44:31,799
All right.

2323
03:44:31,799 --> 03:44:32,600
Look at all this.

2324
03:44:32,600 --> 03:44:43,590
I'm going to make a barley snack.

2325
03:44:43,590 --> 03:44:47,940
Do you not wear underwear with pajamas?

2326
03:44:47,940 --> 03:44:52,629
Um, I mean, are we really going to...

2327
03:44:52,629 --> 03:44:54,469
We're never having this conversation right now.

2328
03:44:54,469 --> 03:45:04,340
I feel like a certain percentage of you just fucking turned your volume up

2329
03:45:04,340 --> 03:45:06,260
and put both your headphones on and leaned in.

2330
03:45:06,260 --> 03:45:07,700
Like just listening intently.

2331
03:45:07,700 --> 03:45:08,739
The next thing I was going to say.

2332
03:45:11,829 --> 03:45:12,629
Settle down.

2333
03:45:12,629 --> 03:45:13,430
Relax.

2334
03:45:13,430 --> 03:45:25,670
He's going to talk about it.

2335
03:45:25,670 --> 03:45:26,469
He's going to talk about it.

2336
03:45:26,469 --> 03:45:27,110
He's going to talk about it.

2337
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:28,790
He's not wearing any underwear.

2338
03:45:28,790 --> 03:45:29,670
He's not wearing any underwear.

2339
03:45:29,670 --> 03:45:30,149
Yeah.

2340
03:45:30,149 --> 03:45:32,739
I'm going to clip it, clip it, clip it.

2341
03:45:32,739 --> 03:45:35,750
Oh, fuck.

2342
03:45:35,750 --> 03:45:36,149
I just...

2343
03:45:36,149 --> 03:45:36,549
I...

2344
03:45:36,549 --> 03:45:37,190
Whatever.

2345
03:45:37,190 --> 03:45:49,659
I want to make my beer.

2346
03:45:49,659 --> 03:45:51,819
My bitter wheat beer.

2347
03:45:51,819 --> 03:45:53,260
I want it to be gross.

2348
03:45:53,260 --> 03:46:00,250
I need water.

2349
03:46:00,250 --> 03:46:14,840
It's really funny because I actually do...

2350
03:46:14,840 --> 03:46:16,280
I do like wheat beer.

2351
03:46:16,280 --> 03:46:20,340
I think wheat beer is the only beer that I really would actually enjoy drinking.

2352
03:46:20,340 --> 03:46:24,059
Kind of funny making my favorite beer.

2353
03:46:24,059 --> 03:46:36,739
The tea.

2354
03:46:36,739 --> 03:46:37,379
Wheat.

2355
03:46:37,379 --> 03:46:38,420
Not weed.

2356
03:46:38,420 --> 03:46:42,819
Can you say wheat wart 10 times fast?

2357
03:46:42,819 --> 03:46:45,260
Probably.

2358
03:46:45,260 --> 03:46:47,659
Wheat wart, wheat wart, wheat wart, wheat wart, wheat wart.

2359
03:46:47,739 --> 03:46:49,739
It wasn't 10, but it was pretty quick, man.

2360
03:46:49,739 --> 03:47:03,190
Can you please talk about Arnold Palmer's now?

2361
03:47:03,190 --> 03:47:05,290
Arnold Palmer's are really good.

2362
03:47:05,290 --> 03:47:18,809
All I have to say about that, apparently.

2363
03:47:18,809 --> 03:47:20,329
Favorite fry dipping sauce.

2364
03:47:20,329 --> 03:47:25,110
I don't know why.

2365
03:47:25,110 --> 03:47:26,549
I find it so funny.

2366
03:47:26,549 --> 03:47:26,870
I don't know.

2367
03:47:26,870 --> 03:47:31,559
I'm just imagining that we're all at Comic Con and it's...

2368
03:47:31,559 --> 03:47:36,149
I have a panel or something and everyone's getting up to the microphone

2369
03:47:36,149 --> 03:47:39,110
asking their question to the guy that's at the panel.

2370
03:47:39,110 --> 03:47:41,850
And you're asking me these questions.

2371
03:47:41,850 --> 03:47:43,530
Oh, hey, hey, Jeremiah.

2372
03:47:43,530 --> 03:47:44,569
I just have a quick question.

2373
03:47:44,569 --> 03:47:46,260
What's your favorite fry dipping sauce?

2374
03:47:48,040 --> 03:47:48,760
Well, that would be...

2375
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:53,020
I like honey mustard or ketchup.

2376
03:47:53,020 --> 03:47:55,100
I'm a ketchup guy sometimes.

2377
03:47:55,100 --> 03:47:55,979
Oh, cool.

2378
03:47:55,979 --> 03:47:56,620
Thank you.

2379
03:47:56,620 --> 03:47:57,829
The next person.

2380
03:47:57,829 --> 03:48:00,870
Do you order medium rare or is it medium steak?

2381
03:48:00,870 --> 03:48:02,500
Well, that's a good question.

2382
03:48:02,500 --> 03:48:03,700
Appreciate the comment.

2383
03:48:03,700 --> 03:48:04,440
I think that...

2384
03:48:04,440 --> 03:48:07,479
I mean, I do like a medium to medium well.

2385
03:48:07,479 --> 03:48:08,920
I like a medium steak.

2386
03:48:08,920 --> 03:48:09,559
Oh, awesome.

2387
03:48:09,559 --> 03:48:10,120
Thanks.

2388
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:12,020
Hey, dude, what do you think about...

2389
03:48:12,020 --> 03:48:14,420
What's the hottest level of chili pepper you're willing to eat?

2390
03:48:14,420 --> 03:48:15,559
Awesome question.

2391
03:48:15,559 --> 03:48:16,280
Thanks for asking that.

2392
03:48:16,840 --> 03:48:18,680
And this is what I do for like an hour and a half.

2393
03:48:18,680 --> 03:48:29,159
All right.

2394
03:48:29,159 --> 03:48:30,360
I want my wheat beer.

2395
03:48:30,440 --> 03:48:31,930
Come on.

2396
03:48:31,930 --> 03:48:32,649
Hurry up.

2397
03:48:32,649 --> 03:48:42,739
Let me just have that stream forever.

2398
03:48:42,739 --> 03:48:46,870
I feel like after this many years,

2399
03:48:46,870 --> 03:48:48,870
you guys have most of my food preferences

2400
03:48:48,870 --> 03:48:51,430
and beverage preferences down to a T.

2401
03:48:51,430 --> 03:49:24,920
I'm just gonna go to bed and wake up and then finish it.

2402
03:49:24,920 --> 03:49:27,270
Okay, there's wheatwort.

2403
03:49:27,270 --> 03:49:28,229
Wheat ale.

2404
03:49:28,229 --> 03:49:28,870
Wow.

2405
03:49:28,870 --> 03:49:31,350
This is worth a lot more than this.

2406
03:49:31,989 --> 03:49:36,120
Why did I even go down this path?

2407
03:49:36,120 --> 03:49:37,000
24.

2408
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:38,520
Everything else is 61.

2409
03:49:38,520 --> 03:49:41,479
These are way better.

2410
03:49:41,479 --> 03:49:43,799
Honey wheat with a little bit of bitter in it?

2411
03:49:43,799 --> 03:49:45,290
Let's go.

2412
03:49:45,290 --> 03:49:49,659
I'm going to bed.

2413
03:49:49,659 --> 03:49:54,809
No, I'll do a collection day because I want food in here too.

2414
03:49:54,809 --> 03:50:09,190
Can I sell the roasted barley?

2415
03:50:09,190 --> 03:50:09,590
Can't.

2416
03:50:09,590 --> 03:50:15,420
I can't put the roasted barley up into the bar.

2417
03:50:15,420 --> 03:50:16,860
That's technically food, right?

2418
03:50:16,860 --> 03:50:33,899
Hey, Jerm, I heard you once ate an entire kong full of peanut butter.

2419
03:50:33,899 --> 03:50:34,780
Oh, man.

2420
03:50:34,780 --> 03:50:50,840
Expensive kong with peanut butter and...

2421
03:50:50,840 --> 03:50:59,420
Are curly fries better?

2422
03:50:59,420 --> 03:51:03,399
It depends on the day.

2423
03:51:03,399 --> 03:51:07,940
Sometimes I prefer a fry that's got...

2424
03:51:07,940 --> 03:51:10,340
It's a very firm and crunchy.

2425
03:51:10,340 --> 03:51:12,579
Sometimes I prefer some curly fries.

2426
03:51:12,579 --> 03:51:17,370
I think it depends on the day.

2427
03:51:17,370 --> 03:51:35,620
We're all such complex beings.

2428
03:51:35,620 --> 03:51:46,889
Fry wedges?

2429
03:51:46,889 --> 03:51:52,219
I get more food-related questions than cooking channels.

2430
03:51:52,219 --> 03:51:54,540
And you know, I'm not even upset about it.

2431
03:51:54,540 --> 03:51:56,170
I like like talk.

2432
03:51:56,170 --> 03:51:57,209
I love food.

2433
03:51:57,209 --> 03:51:59,670
I really do.

2434
03:51:59,670 --> 03:52:01,110
It's like one of my favorite things ever.

2435
03:52:01,110 --> 03:52:15,530
Honestly, some of my fondest memories were around kind of eating something and hanging out.

2436
03:52:15,530 --> 03:52:17,770
Not only do I have the memory of the thing that I thought was interesting,

2437
03:52:17,770 --> 03:52:19,450
I have the memory of the food I was eating.

2438
03:52:19,450 --> 03:52:31,420
Pretty cool.

2439
03:52:31,420 --> 03:52:32,139
Aging shelf.

2440
03:52:32,139 --> 03:52:33,500
That's probably for wine, maybe?

2441
03:52:33,500 --> 03:52:35,479
Whiskey or something.

2442
03:52:35,479 --> 03:52:38,309
My beer ready yet.

2443
03:52:38,309 --> 03:52:54,440
I need some more seeds.

2444
03:52:54,440 --> 03:52:57,719
I have so much corn in my inventory and I don't even know what to do with it.

2445
03:52:57,719 --> 03:53:04,299
I'll get some rye seeds.

2446
03:53:04,299 --> 03:53:13,670
Oh, check on the birdhouse.

2447
03:53:13,670 --> 03:53:14,309
That's cool.

2448
03:53:14,309 --> 03:53:15,479
Good idea.

2449
03:53:15,479 --> 03:53:28,100
Are you in there?

2450
03:53:28,100 --> 03:53:39,059
Not yet.

2451
03:53:39,059 --> 03:53:42,809
Taste is said to be linked to memory.

2452
03:53:42,809 --> 03:53:45,219
Yeah, smells are like that too.

2453
03:53:45,219 --> 03:54:06,790
I don't know if I could really do a full on what is your favorite foods.

2454
03:54:06,790 --> 03:54:12,809
Buffalo chicken is up there at least in one of the top three.

2455
03:54:12,809 --> 03:54:19,260
And let me make this clarified.

2456
03:54:19,260 --> 03:54:22,059
Not buffalo chicken wings.

2457
03:54:22,059 --> 03:54:26,299
Buffalo chicken cutlets.

2458
03:54:26,299 --> 03:54:27,879
Buffalo chicken tenders.

2459
03:54:27,879 --> 03:54:29,559
Buffalo chicken cutlets.

2460
03:54:31,260 --> 03:54:35,350
I like wings but it's not as good for me as the cutlet version.

2461
03:54:35,350 --> 03:54:36,229
Like in a sub.

2462
03:54:36,229 --> 03:54:39,899
Buffalo chicken sub is...

2463
03:54:39,899 --> 03:54:43,260
I'm like the dog running around in the fucking bacon commercial.

2464
03:54:43,260 --> 03:54:44,299
Like, give me, give me, give me.

2465
03:54:44,299 --> 03:54:45,180
It's bacon.

2466
03:54:45,180 --> 03:54:46,940
That's me with the buffalo chicken sub.

2467
03:54:46,940 --> 03:55:02,329
Fucking bacon strips, dog.

2468
03:55:02,329 --> 03:55:03,450
Salmon is up there too.

2469
03:55:03,450 --> 03:55:04,969
I'd say at least in the top five.

2470
03:55:04,969 --> 03:55:08,540
I'm making materials while I wait.

2471
03:55:08,540 --> 03:55:23,930
Yeah, pretty much a chicken cutlet.

2472
03:55:23,930 --> 03:55:26,569
Flat chicken cutlet.

2473
03:55:28,979 --> 03:55:33,879
You can turn that into buffalo chicken or chicken cutlet sandwich or chicken parm.

2474
03:55:34,620 --> 03:55:37,020
I think that chicken cutlet is number one.

2475
03:55:37,020 --> 03:55:44,979
So maybe it's not buffalo chicken.

2476
03:55:44,979 --> 03:55:47,620
It's probably like the way that the chicken is prepared.

2477
03:55:47,620 --> 03:55:52,520
Chicken cutlet.

2478
03:55:52,520 --> 03:55:53,719
Because I'm not...

2479
03:55:53,719 --> 03:55:58,620
Fried chicken is not really what I'm all about.

2480
03:55:58,620 --> 03:56:03,110
I like fried chicken but not that like kind of KFC style.

2481
03:56:03,110 --> 03:56:05,079
I do like it.

2482
03:56:05,079 --> 03:56:09,479
Not the way that I like chicken cutlets.

2483
03:56:09,479 --> 03:56:10,600
Chicken katsu, yep.

2484
03:56:10,600 --> 03:56:11,770
Precisely.

2485
03:56:11,770 --> 03:56:23,049
Pesto on a scale of one to ten.

2486
03:56:23,049 --> 03:56:45,989
Probably a nine.

2487
03:56:45,989 --> 03:56:50,500
Yeah, it probably is.

2488
03:56:50,500 --> 03:56:55,829
I have to really be in the mood for it when I do like it.

2489
03:56:55,829 --> 03:56:56,870
And I'm ready to...

2490
03:56:56,870 --> 03:56:57,750
Well, yeah, I want that.

2491
03:56:57,750 --> 03:57:07,899
It's definitely at least like an eight or nine at least.

2492
03:57:07,899 --> 03:57:09,979
Oh, is Diablo 4 going to be fun?

2493
03:57:09,979 --> 03:57:13,319
Please, please tell me.

2494
03:57:13,319 --> 03:57:23,590
Is it?

2495
03:57:23,590 --> 03:57:27,430
I feel like a lot of people are probably doing this.

2496
03:57:27,430 --> 03:57:30,790
I am setting my expectations to zero.

2497
03:57:30,790 --> 03:57:33,500
So there's only one way to go.

2498
03:57:33,500 --> 03:57:41,059
You know what I mean?

2499
03:57:41,059 --> 03:57:43,940
There's only one way to go with Diablo 4 for me.

2500
03:57:43,940 --> 03:57:55,190
Is there anything else that I need that I haven't bought yet in a mug?

2501
03:57:55,190 --> 03:58:03,829
I was not a huge fan of Diablo Immortal.

2502
03:58:03,829 --> 03:58:07,350
I tried it and I was like, no, no, no, no.

2503
03:58:07,350 --> 03:58:09,559
I just was like, no, thank you.

2504
03:58:09,559 --> 03:58:09,799
No.

2505
03:58:15,620 --> 03:58:16,899
I'm not a huge fan.

2506
03:58:17,379 --> 03:58:19,219
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of that game.

2507
03:58:19,219 --> 03:58:42,440
I know I'm such a nostalgia person and I just want it to be this.

2508
03:58:42,440 --> 03:58:42,920
I don't know.

2509
03:58:42,920 --> 03:58:44,040
It's like, dude, you're boring.

2510
03:58:44,040 --> 03:58:45,239
But that's what I want.

2511
03:58:45,239 --> 03:58:53,479
I really just want a Diablo 2 that is expanded graphics or unique items.

2512
03:58:53,479 --> 03:58:54,360
Just uniques.

2513
03:58:54,360 --> 03:58:55,159
I love uniques.

2514
03:58:55,159 --> 03:58:57,159
It's like one of my favorite things about that entire game.

2515
03:58:57,159 --> 03:58:58,360
The whole franchise.

2516
03:58:58,360 --> 03:59:06,010
Uniques and not random uniques.

2517
03:59:06,010 --> 03:59:10,629
I like randomness, but only built into the item itself.

2518
03:59:10,709 --> 03:59:19,930
So for instance, if you have a pair of gloves and that pair of gloves is 100 to 150% enhanced

2519
03:59:19,930 --> 03:59:27,829
defense and then between 5 and 10 strength and then this between randomness inside the

2520
03:59:27,829 --> 03:59:28,870
item is fine.

2521
03:59:28,870 --> 03:59:31,030
But I want the item to be unique.

2522
03:59:31,030 --> 03:59:45,930
I want the item to be a unique item.

2523
03:59:45,930 --> 03:59:49,270
Yeah, that's I just I want more of that.

2524
03:59:49,270 --> 03:59:55,670
I feel like a lot of the games recently, it's kind of just throw a bunch of random

2525
03:59:55,670 --> 03:59:57,110
fucking numbers on everything.

2526
04:00:00,819 --> 04:00:04,739
Like here's a sword and it's got like a bunch of crazy fixes on it.

2527
04:00:04,739 --> 04:00:11,750
And it's just a bunch of look at how crazy it is.

2528
04:00:11,750 --> 04:00:12,469
There we go.

2529
04:00:12,469 --> 04:00:13,270
Finally, wheat ale.

2530
04:00:13,270 --> 04:00:13,829
Let's go.

2531
04:00:13,829 --> 04:00:15,079
I have to open.

2532
04:00:15,079 --> 04:00:19,379
So I've got this one.

2533
04:00:19,379 --> 04:00:21,430
This is my wheat ale.

2534
04:00:21,430 --> 04:00:25,860
I'm going to make the stew because it sells really well.

2535
04:00:25,860 --> 04:00:28,120
And it's the only thing I can make.

2536
04:00:28,120 --> 04:00:41,239
I'm just going to make corn a spicy corn and wheat spicy corn porridge with wheat sprinkles.

2537
04:00:41,239 --> 04:00:56,920
Never got into Diablo.

2538
04:00:56,920 --> 04:00:59,559
It feels like a ton of shit's happening and I need the wiki pulled up for everything.

2539
04:01:02,659 --> 04:01:04,180
New Diablo is like that.

2540
04:01:04,180 --> 04:01:13,420
Diablo 2 was pretty easy to understand.

2541
04:01:13,420 --> 04:01:21,129
Diablo 2.

2542
04:01:21,129 --> 04:01:24,600
I feel like it was just is this thing better than what I have on?

2543
04:01:24,600 --> 04:01:25,879
It's very simple to know.

2544
04:01:25,879 --> 04:01:30,059
And I know it's really simple to know the other games too.

2545
04:01:30,059 --> 04:01:36,700
But I don't I don't think you need a wiki for Diablo 2.

2546
04:01:36,700 --> 04:01:38,149
It's just yeah.

2547
04:01:38,149 --> 04:01:43,829
Diablo 2 is more about the skills than it is about anything else.

2548
04:01:43,829 --> 04:01:48,469
Learning what synergizes with what and where you want to put your points.

2549
04:01:48,469 --> 04:01:54,840
Diablo 2 is just get plus skill level stuff.

2550
04:01:54,840 --> 04:01:57,020
That's what you're striving to do.

2551
04:01:57,020 --> 04:02:04,360
And then what something else was important to have enough.

2552
04:02:05,930 --> 04:02:13,110
Making money today.

2553
04:02:13,110 --> 04:02:14,709
All right I've got corn.

2554
04:02:14,709 --> 04:02:21,110
This is corn chili starch veggie starchy seedy.

2555
04:02:21,110 --> 04:02:26,889
That sounds awful.

2556
04:02:26,889 --> 04:02:30,489
If you explained to me a soup that was seedy starchy with veggies in it.

2557
04:02:30,489 --> 04:02:32,010
I'd be like well I'm not ordering that.

2558
04:02:32,010 --> 04:02:36,860
But it's okay because this is a video game.

2559
04:02:36,860 --> 04:02:41,850
All right I'm ready to open.

2560
04:02:41,850 --> 04:02:48,440
I forgot to put the other bench down but whatever.

2561
04:02:48,440 --> 04:02:49,479
Can I do it now?

2562
04:02:49,479 --> 04:02:51,350
We're closed.

2563
04:02:51,350 --> 04:03:05,590
Okay we're open.

2564
04:03:05,590 --> 04:03:25,700
That's a lot.

2565
04:03:25,700 --> 04:03:31,299
330 for that.

2566
04:03:31,299 --> 04:03:32,739
160 and 330.

2567
04:03:32,739 --> 04:03:42,309
All right let me get everybody at a table and then I'll clean.

2568
04:03:42,309 --> 04:03:44,629
350 actually 360.

2569
04:03:44,709 --> 04:03:55,049
The cat helping you serve.

2570
04:03:55,049 --> 04:03:56,729
That's funny but I don't think so.

2571
04:03:56,729 --> 04:04:03,860
Have enough beer.

2572
04:04:03,860 --> 04:04:08,420
Everybody doing all right.

2573
04:04:08,420 --> 04:04:09,219
Getting clean.

2574
04:04:09,219 --> 04:04:22,520
Where are the cats just hanging out?

2575
04:04:22,520 --> 04:04:36,200
Too hot.

2576
04:04:36,200 --> 04:04:45,899
All right one gold is 100.

2577
04:04:45,899 --> 04:04:49,610
Yeah it's kind of the 100 copper is one silver.

2578
04:04:49,610 --> 04:04:51,370
100 silver is one gold.

2579
04:04:51,370 --> 04:05:13,850
It was worth waiting for the wheat beer.

2580
04:05:13,850 --> 04:05:21,370
What's up the stairs?

2581
04:05:21,370 --> 04:05:23,850
I think it's a it's another storage room.

2582
04:05:23,850 --> 04:05:39,510
Must be two gold.

2583
04:05:39,510 --> 04:05:40,549
Oh my god I'm so sorry.

2584
04:05:40,549 --> 04:05:41,750
I didn't mean to bump that.

2585
04:05:41,750 --> 04:05:44,940
You can play Dead Rising again.

2586
04:05:44,940 --> 04:05:45,819
Oh yeah that's not what you asked.

2587
04:05:45,819 --> 04:05:47,819
You said when is the Dead Rising stream?

2588
04:05:47,819 --> 04:05:51,940
I played the first two.

2589
04:05:51,940 --> 04:05:55,139
I played the third one almost what a decade ago with stir.

2590
04:05:55,940 --> 04:05:58,149
Well we kind of just messed around.

2591
04:05:58,149 --> 04:06:00,229
We didn't really actually try to play the game for real.

2592
04:06:00,870 --> 04:06:02,280
Maybe I would just stream it.

2593
04:06:06,889 --> 04:06:09,290
Those Dead Rising 2 streams are some of I think the

2594
04:06:10,180 --> 04:06:12,979
I feel like that's some of the most fun I've had on broadcast.

2595
04:06:13,620 --> 04:06:15,879
Ever.

2596
04:06:15,879 --> 04:06:18,840
That game was out of control at some points.

2597
04:06:18,840 --> 04:06:20,280
Dead Rising 1 and Dead Rising 2.

2598
04:06:20,920 --> 04:06:23,559
These games are so much fun.

2599
04:06:24,120 --> 04:06:37,129
But Dead Rising 4.

2600
04:06:37,690 --> 04:06:40,489
Dead Rising 4 I think was a monumental disappointment.

2601
04:06:41,290 --> 04:06:44,979
I think I streamed it and it just wasn't very good.

2602
04:06:45,700 --> 04:06:48,459
Or just not it wasn't what I wanted.

2603
04:06:48,459 --> 04:06:49,500
It wasn't what I was expecting.

2604
04:06:53,930 --> 04:06:55,530
Didn't have very much fun playing it.

2605
04:07:03,799 --> 04:07:07,159
You know I always thought that something that they were going to do was they did the mall.

2606
04:07:07,159 --> 04:07:10,520
It was like oh the mall you're in the mall look at all the stuff at the mall.

2607
04:07:11,479 --> 04:07:15,159
I was under the impression I was like you know what what if I'm thinking okay they're doing

2608
04:07:15,159 --> 04:07:19,879
where is there a place with a ton of random shit kind of random stuff.

2609
04:07:21,290 --> 04:07:22,969
I thought they were going to go to an amusement park.

2610
04:07:23,610 --> 04:07:27,319
Imagine like roller coasters and stuff and like all the zombies like

2611
04:07:27,319 --> 04:07:28,440
imagine that how crazy that would be.

2612
04:07:46,579 --> 04:07:48,500
You could do a full amusement park.

2613
04:07:49,219 --> 04:07:55,379
And I think that keeps it fresh.

2614
04:07:55,379 --> 04:08:00,620
Just think about all the random encounters you could do with the midway games and roller

2615
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:05,020
coasters and different rides and different bosses that would be I imagine you can fight

2616
04:08:05,020 --> 04:08:07,579
somebody a boss on one of the roller coasters.

2617
04:08:07,579 --> 04:08:08,459
Wouldn't that be awesome?

2618
04:08:09,260 --> 04:08:13,319
It could be a whole giant cinematic scene where you fight a boss on the roller coaster.

2619
04:08:24,100 --> 04:08:25,700
I'm going to go through all this inventory if I have it.

2620
04:08:26,260 --> 04:08:27,399
I'm supposed to stay open.

2621
04:08:33,209 --> 04:08:35,450
You can do that in the Jimmy Neutron game.

2622
04:08:35,450 --> 04:08:39,159
That's pretty fun.

2623
04:08:39,159 --> 04:08:59,850
Oh this person's gonna get pissed.

2624
04:08:59,850 --> 04:09:18,790
I can make at least another 40 or 50 silver here.

2625
04:09:18,790 --> 04:09:21,129
Unless it might get too late people might leave.

2626
04:09:21,690 --> 04:09:29,819
Please play Jimmy Neutron Attack of the Twonkies.

2627
04:09:30,620 --> 04:09:40,569
That sounds like a made-up game.

2628
04:09:41,290 --> 04:09:42,889
You didn't just make that up.

2629
04:09:42,889 --> 04:09:58,969
Now it's real okay.

2630
04:09:58,969 --> 04:10:12,889
That fire wood here yep.

2631
04:10:12,889 --> 04:10:23,670
What Nickelodeon character wouldn't survive the zombie apocalypse?

2632
04:10:34,280 --> 04:10:41,059
Oh Patrick.

2633
04:10:58,889 --> 04:11:05,610
Patrick is fine.

2634
04:11:05,610 --> 04:11:06,090
I don't know.

2635
04:11:15,350 --> 04:11:19,510
I feel like Patrick would just think it was like something something wasn't dangerous was

2636
04:11:19,510 --> 04:11:24,620
happening or something like oh here's a bunch of new friends in town or something right.

2637
04:11:27,860 --> 04:11:29,540
Patrick no those are zombies.

2638
04:11:32,409 --> 04:11:33,450
Patrick be careful.

2639
04:11:34,659 --> 04:11:35,940
Don't go near those things.

2640
04:11:35,940 --> 04:11:37,700
Those are zombies Patrick.

2641
04:11:37,700 --> 04:12:06,440
What's wrong with me?

2642
04:12:06,440 --> 04:12:07,719
Oh shit I gotta close.

2643
04:12:13,700 --> 04:12:15,139
Everybody hurry up and get out of here.

2644
04:12:20,809 --> 04:12:21,690
All right everybody get out.

2645
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:22,090
Thank you.

2646
04:12:22,090 --> 04:12:22,569
I appreciate it.

2647
04:12:22,569 --> 04:12:23,690
That was a really good day.

2648
04:12:23,690 --> 04:12:42,600
Get out one last spot to clean.

2649
04:12:54,520 --> 04:12:55,319
It's 3 a.m.

2650
04:12:55,319 --> 04:13:01,700
I feel like you started streaming and then we instantly just asked a bunch of questions.

2651
04:13:01,700 --> 04:13:04,329
This most kind of just like a question stream.

2652
04:13:04,329 --> 04:13:05,290
That's fine we're just hanging on.

2653
04:13:24,729 --> 04:13:28,549
I want bigger tables but let me see you.

2654
04:13:28,549 --> 04:13:29,829
I have a lot of experience points.

2655
04:13:32,500 --> 04:13:33,459
I could go for rye.

2656
04:13:33,459 --> 04:13:34,260
I could go for wine.

2657
04:13:34,819 --> 04:13:35,700
Well not yet actually.

2658
04:13:43,379 --> 04:13:45,700
Soup oh here we go sausages.

2659
04:13:45,700 --> 04:13:46,659
Where do I get meat?

2660
04:13:47,299 --> 04:13:49,479
Where do I get meat from?

2661
04:13:52,579 --> 04:13:55,850
I want apples berries.

2662
04:13:56,489 --> 04:14:00,329
All right let's do apples and berries.

2663
04:14:00,729 --> 04:14:10,409
Let me go check out the town.

2664
04:14:10,409 --> 04:14:12,629
I feel like it's been a while.

2665
04:14:12,629 --> 04:14:14,739
Probably something I can.

2666
04:14:14,739 --> 04:14:15,780
Wait what about the calendar?

2667
04:14:15,780 --> 04:14:21,319
Eh whatever.

2668
04:14:21,319 --> 04:14:23,719
Didn't it say to take a look at the calendar?

2669
04:14:23,719 --> 04:14:31,659
Because there's events right?

2670
04:14:31,659 --> 04:14:32,700
I guess not.

2671
04:14:32,700 --> 04:14:46,180
I need more of these tanks.

2672
04:14:46,180 --> 04:15:06,170
Because I really should have more than one to go explore today.

2673
04:15:06,170 --> 04:15:08,459
Yeah probably the plan.

2674
04:15:08,459 --> 04:15:13,770
Is it done?

2675
04:15:13,770 --> 04:15:17,399
I'm gonna go down.

2676
04:15:17,399 --> 04:15:25,860
How many fingers am I holding up?

2677
04:15:25,860 --> 04:15:26,340
Three.

2678
04:15:26,340 --> 04:15:34,420
I wonder if that just freaked you out.

2679
04:15:34,420 --> 04:15:37,159
What if it was three?

2680
04:15:37,159 --> 04:15:47,860
That's like an excel the window shot down computer.

2681
04:15:50,680 --> 04:15:51,239
What the fuck?

2682
04:15:51,239 --> 04:16:17,370
This is like a stardew like how is it?

2683
04:16:17,370 --> 04:16:24,020
So far it's it is very much like stardew.

2684
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:29,420
I think it's a lot more about to me.

2685
04:16:30,600 --> 04:16:38,200
I would put the actual video game play to something more like Diner Dash in a way.

2686
04:16:38,200 --> 04:16:40,680
Like serving and then running around and wiping the tables.

2687
04:16:40,680 --> 04:16:44,440
And the customer is complaining and kind of like that in a way.

2688
04:16:44,440 --> 04:16:46,600
And I imagine later on the game probably gets a little more hectic.

2689
04:16:50,100 --> 04:16:54,180
But there are you know all this crafting and resource management.

2690
04:16:55,139 --> 04:17:03,909
I don't see any there's no birds.

2691
04:17:03,909 --> 04:17:08,340
Look at the birds.

2692
04:17:08,340 --> 04:17:11,540
I think is this still in early access or is this out in 1.0?

2693
04:17:11,540 --> 04:17:24,950
I think it's early access still.

2694
04:17:24,950 --> 04:17:29,399
Well okay if you like Stardew Valley and you like alcohol I guess.

2695
04:17:29,959 --> 04:17:33,079
Because this is just you it's you run a tavern.

2696
04:17:42,260 --> 04:17:44,180
Hit somebody with your axe.

2697
04:17:44,180 --> 04:17:49,750
Twitch chat is such a funny place.

2698
04:17:49,750 --> 04:17:52,569
It really is because in between in in between.

2699
04:17:52,569 --> 04:17:54,809
Hey what do you think about this game?

2700
04:17:54,809 --> 04:17:56,250
This is a really interesting video game.

2701
04:17:56,250 --> 04:17:57,850
But kind of like looks like Stardew Valley.

2702
04:17:57,850 --> 04:17:58,729
What's your opinion on it?

2703
04:17:59,370 --> 04:18:01,530
Oh hey dude like do you like medium rare steak?

2704
04:18:01,530 --> 04:18:03,370
Hit someone in the fucking head with your axe.

2705
04:18:06,309 --> 04:18:08,149
So many different worlds going on.

2706
04:18:08,149 --> 04:18:10,309
There's so many different things happening at once.

2707
04:18:11,530 --> 04:18:15,420
It's such an interesting dichotomy.

2708
04:18:15,420 --> 04:18:34,620
I want to spend some money on something nice.

2709
04:18:34,620 --> 04:18:39,940
I have three gold what am I buying?

2710
04:18:39,940 --> 04:18:54,139
Oh frying mat?

2711
04:18:54,139 --> 04:19:07,989
When you shut down your computer do you close everything first?

2712
04:19:07,989 --> 04:19:09,620
Usually yeah.

2713
04:19:09,620 --> 04:19:15,059
I always hate seeing that that screen.

2714
04:19:15,059 --> 04:19:16,979
Especially in Windows when you're shutting something down.

2715
04:19:16,979 --> 04:19:20,889
And it's you know your computer's almost like hey dude.

2716
04:19:20,889 --> 04:19:23,049
Some programs are not closed.

2717
04:19:23,049 --> 04:19:24,329
What's wrong with you?

2718
04:19:24,329 --> 04:19:25,450
What are you thinking?

2719
04:19:26,569 --> 04:19:28,889
And it just goes oh fuck oh it's gonna close them automatically.

2720
04:19:28,889 --> 04:19:29,450
No what do I do?

2721
04:19:29,450 --> 04:19:30,170
It cancel.

2722
04:19:30,170 --> 04:19:33,770
All right I got I got blueberry seed.

2723
04:19:33,770 --> 04:19:35,129
Let's make this a little bigger.

2724
04:19:35,129 --> 04:19:37,209
Because if I'm gonna have blueberries and stuff I want it to be bigger.

2725
04:19:58,520 --> 04:20:15,899
Apples and then I'll just do make two more little areas.

2726
04:20:15,899 --> 04:20:17,340
I bought 40 of each.

2727
04:20:17,340 --> 04:20:19,260
I'm realizing that was probably not a good idea.

2728
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:52,899
Why are you digging like this?

2729
04:20:52,899 --> 04:21:07,370
Because I messed it up and I want to make sure I'll patch out them.

2730
04:21:07,370 --> 04:21:21,350
Um okay so now that's how many is this total?

2731
04:21:21,430 --> 04:22:39,420
1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 7, 8, 39, 40, 41, 46.

2732
04:22:39,420 --> 04:22:54,250
Okay so 46.

2733
04:22:54,250 --> 04:22:56,409
I need to take away six uh spaces.

2734
04:22:56,409 --> 04:23:00,969
Should I take them out of the middle?

2735
04:23:00,969 --> 04:23:12,059
Would it be more aesthetically pleasing if it was in the middle?

2736
04:23:12,139 --> 04:23:17,620
1, 1, 2, or 1, 2, 3.

2737
04:23:17,620 --> 04:24:01,000
All right this is kind of just a big booger in the middle but it'll be all right.

2738
04:24:01,000 --> 04:24:10,889
It's uneven.

2739
04:24:11,530 --> 04:24:19,899
I'll fix it.

2740
04:24:19,899 --> 04:24:21,500
All right this is gonna be apples.

2741
04:24:21,500 --> 04:24:24,360
I almost tried to just plant the porridge.

2742
04:24:37,610 --> 04:24:48,170
This is not right.

2743
04:24:48,170 --> 04:24:49,290
They're trees.

2744
04:24:49,290 --> 04:24:52,489
I for some reason was like why can I buy so many of these?

2745
04:25:04,010 --> 04:25:12,329
Okay we're gonna have a whole and we're gonna have a whole orchard here.

2746
04:25:12,329 --> 04:25:14,010
No, no, no, no, no.

2747
04:25:14,969 --> 04:25:15,930
Blueberries are going here.

2748
04:25:15,930 --> 04:25:17,049
Remove, remove, remove it.

2749
04:25:17,049 --> 04:25:32,520
How do I undo it?

2750
04:25:32,520 --> 04:25:33,559
There we go.

2751
04:25:33,559 --> 04:25:41,479
All right blueberries.

2752
04:25:41,479 --> 04:25:42,440
Here they come.

2753
04:25:42,440 --> 04:25:51,860
I have one left.

2754
04:25:51,860 --> 04:25:53,299
I didn't calculate this right.

2755
04:25:53,299 --> 04:26:07,860
I got an idea.

2756
04:26:07,860 --> 04:26:22,809
The bar open?

2757
04:26:22,809 --> 04:26:26,360
No it is.

2758
04:26:26,360 --> 04:26:31,079
Oh shit oh I'm sorry.

2759
04:26:31,079 --> 04:26:31,879
I didn't read.

2760
04:26:31,879 --> 04:26:32,920
Here take some stew.

2761
04:26:37,989 --> 04:26:39,350
Everybody's so hungry.

2762
04:26:39,989 --> 04:26:44,520
What is he doing out there?

2763
04:26:44,520 --> 04:26:49,879
He's he's trying to plant a bunch of he he's trying to plant 40 different apple trees.

2764
04:26:50,600 --> 04:26:52,860
Oh thank god everything's fine.

2765
04:26:56,280 --> 04:26:58,840
No I'm sorry I just screamed but it was actually scary.

2766
04:26:59,559 --> 04:27:00,920
I thought I was gonna lose or something.

2767
04:27:01,719 --> 04:27:09,500
That was truly terrifying.

2768
04:27:09,500 --> 04:27:10,700
Why is the store open?

2769
04:27:10,700 --> 04:27:11,819
I didn't how did I not?

2770
04:27:11,819 --> 04:27:17,559
Oh this drink sucks.

2771
04:27:17,559 --> 04:27:19,000
It's because I don't have anything on tap.

2772
04:27:20,200 --> 04:27:21,319
What are they even drinking?

2773
04:27:21,879 --> 04:27:25,000
Oh no oh no I have to I'm gonna have to attack somebody.

2774
04:27:25,000 --> 04:27:29,159
I'm sorry all right now get out get out of here.

2775
04:27:29,159 --> 04:27:38,420
I'm sorry I opened up so late but that's no need to throw stuff at people and attack anybody.

2776
04:27:38,420 --> 04:27:39,780
I'm serving water.

2777
04:27:40,260 --> 04:27:54,809
Make it nice and toasty in here.

2778
04:27:54,809 --> 04:27:59,639
Listen I'll I'll it's only gruel that's the only thing I have.

2779
04:28:02,299 --> 04:28:04,700
All right we're closed thanks for coming in.

2780
04:28:04,700 --> 04:28:07,079
I'm gonna get such a bad rating.

2781
04:28:07,079 --> 04:28:08,760
I'm gonna rage quit this stream I think.

2782
04:28:08,760 --> 04:28:16,540
They're all gonna give negative I'm gonna lose negative experience.

2783
04:28:28,040 --> 04:28:28,760
How?

2784
04:28:28,760 --> 04:28:45,899
I spent two or three days crafting a recipe and making honey wheat beer with like a hint of cayenne pepper in it and I get shit on.

2785
04:28:46,790 --> 04:28:55,780
I serve gruel out of a fucking an old refrigerator out back and this I get the rave reviews.

2786
04:28:55,780 --> 04:29:12,229
Okay this one is mild ale.

2787
04:29:12,229 --> 04:29:15,030
Did I have anything anything cool with this?

2788
04:29:15,030 --> 04:29:16,069
No I think it's just regular ale.

2789
04:29:16,629 --> 04:29:24,950
Okay back to what I was doing.

2790
04:29:25,590 --> 04:29:34,979
Can I plant a apple tree in the middle?

2791
04:29:34,979 --> 04:29:45,860
That'd be pretty cool damn it.

2792
04:29:45,860 --> 04:29:51,579
Well I'm sorry guys but I have to plant 40 apple trees.

2793
04:29:51,579 --> 04:29:52,780
Don't be mad at me.

2794
04:29:53,420 --> 04:29:58,420
Shit okay hold on.

2795
04:29:58,420 --> 04:30:01,239
I mean I bought them.

2796
04:30:01,959 --> 04:30:03,879
It's a waste huge waste of money if I don't.

2797
04:30:03,879 --> 04:30:04,680
How many was it eight?

2798
04:30:20,809 --> 04:30:27,370
Okay so I need to it's gonna take so long.

2799
04:30:29,930 --> 04:30:40,090
It's gonna be here for days man it's all right.

2800
04:30:40,649 --> 04:31:02,819
I'm not gonna plant all 40 but just enough for it to make sense.

2801
04:31:02,819 --> 04:31:26,420
Three four I'll do three and then yeah okay I'll do four.

2802
04:31:26,420 --> 04:31:28,260
We'll do four right here that's easy.

2803
04:31:28,260 --> 04:31:30,819
Maybe maybe I'll just go all the way up.

2804
04:31:30,819 --> 04:31:32,500
Yeah all right I'm going all the way up.

2805
04:31:32,500 --> 04:31:35,219
Everyone just look relax it's late at night just chill.

2806
04:31:35,540 --> 04:31:38,020
That's what we're doing.

2807
04:31:39,059 --> 04:32:16,090
It's so uneven okay it doesn't matter if it's uneven.

2808
04:32:16,090 --> 04:32:18,250
Just matters that it's there and it's growing.

2809
04:32:20,600 --> 04:32:24,090
And look is it really that uneven?

2810
04:32:24,090 --> 04:32:39,049
You're forgetting about the seeds we're planting here.

2811
04:32:39,049 --> 04:32:42,790
No don't be an idiot.

2812
04:32:43,989 --> 04:32:44,709
Don't be an idiot.

2813
04:33:33,909 --> 04:33:36,869
Just what I'm playing the game.

2814
04:33:36,869 --> 04:33:48,409
This part is already done for me.

2815
04:33:48,409 --> 04:33:55,939
That's one going on here.

2816
04:33:55,939 --> 04:34:01,689
Why can I not go this way?

2817
04:34:01,689 --> 04:34:07,979
Okay so what's going on what's going on?

2818
04:34:13,479 --> 04:34:16,119
Oh right because yeah I know what's going on.

2819
04:34:16,119 --> 04:34:22,500
You can't do it in the area of a piece of machinery.

2820
04:34:22,500 --> 04:34:30,200
Well that's fantastic.

2821
04:34:30,200 --> 04:34:45,000
Okay it'll be fine I'll just plant them here.

2822
04:34:45,639 --> 04:34:48,040
Two more and that's it.

2823
04:35:00,869 --> 04:35:01,990
Now this is one more one more.

2824
04:35:03,430 --> 04:35:05,270
I gotta go bed I'm gonna pass out.

2825
04:35:05,270 --> 04:35:29,909
How long do these take to grow I wonder?

2826
04:35:30,470 --> 04:35:39,099
All right I'm going to bed I'm going to bed right now.

2827
04:35:40,439 --> 04:35:51,419
Look see and I'm gonna buy a big wooden framed painting.

2830
04:36:05,700 --> 04:36:23,939
How's our growth look?

Grapes how about raspberries?

2838
04:37:19,259 --> 04:37:30,299
I didn't mean to buy that many I'll get 45.

2839
04:37:30,299 --> 04:37:36,919
Pears all right we got a lot of stuff incoming.

2840
04:37:37,000 --> 04:37:52,310
Pears grow on trees I yeah I know but I just bought a ton of them.

2841
04:37:52,310 --> 04:37:53,029
They were cheap.

2842
04:37:53,029 --> 04:38:05,930
I need to unlock rye.

2843
04:38:05,930 --> 04:38:15,340
Is wheat here's rye oh I have so many of that first category.

2844
04:38:15,340 --> 04:38:20,259
I can't even make the rye berry yet like two more points.

2845
04:38:20,259 --> 04:38:28,900
Why am I messing up?

2846
04:38:28,900 --> 04:38:30,180
That's on tap right now.

2847
04:38:30,180 --> 04:38:37,560
I have some forages that's the corn and rye treat one.

2848

Candles I want to move this too.

2852
04:39:20,970 --> 04:39:38,549
This thing's annoying.

I want to put them in here.

2854
04:39:42,540 --> 04:39:44,139
I did it before I don't know how to do it.

2855
04:39:44,139 --> 04:39:54,470
That other one will burn out it's fine.

2856

This is ale let's make this wheat lager.

2865
04:41:19,799 --> 04:41:23,639
I need wheat wort which is being made right now.

2866
04:41:23,639 --> 04:41:26,779
Is that what's being made?

2867
04:41:26,779 --> 04:41:31,240
I believe I need bitter hops.

2868
04:41:31,240 --> 04:41:32,360
Okay I need hops.

2869
04:41:32,360 --> 04:41:40,759
Hops and what was it hops and lager yeast.

2870
04:41:40,759 --> 04:41:47,990
Then I'm going to bed.

2871
04:41:47,990 --> 04:42:02,069
Get a bunch of shit right.

2872
04:42:02,069 --> 04:42:14,220
I need some more decor.

2873
04:42:14,939 --> 04:42:18,419
There's so many pear trees all over the hell.

2874
04:42:18,419 --> 04:42:21,049
God damn it that's right.

2875
04:42:21,049 --> 04:42:22,330
I'm so embarrassed.

2876
04:42:22,330 --> 04:42:25,540
All right well I'm definitely doing

2877
04:42:25,540 --> 04:42:26,979
strategy strawberries or raspberries.

2878
04:42:26,979 --> 04:42:28,259
Strawberries for sure.

2879
04:42:28,259 --> 04:42:51,020
And then surrounding the trees

2880
04:42:51,099 --> 04:42:56,569
we're gonna plant raspberries.

2881
04:42:56,569 --> 04:42:57,610
Is that possible?

2882
04:42:57,610 --> 04:43:02,380
Only in certain places.

2883
04:43:02,380 --> 04:43:03,529
That's fine.

2884
04:43:03,529 --> 04:43:10,279
Are these ready to harvest?

2885
04:43:10,279 --> 04:43:11,000
Probably not till tomorrow.

2886
04:43:11,000 --> 04:43:11,560
All right I'm going to bed

2887
04:43:11,560 --> 04:43:13,240
because I want to wake up and see the plants.

2888
04:43:13,240 --> 04:43:30,979
Going to bed at 10 in the morning.

2889
04:43:30,979 --> 04:43:32,500
Yeah but it's the video game equivalent

2890
04:43:32,500 --> 04:43:34,900
of time traveling to speed up the timers.

2891
04:43:34,900 --> 04:43:43,500
The wheat all right I need hops and water.

2892
04:43:43,500 --> 04:43:46,680
Did I bump you?

2893
04:43:46,680 --> 04:43:49,900
I'm sorry I did I didn't mean to.

2894
04:43:49,900 --> 04:43:57,779
Is there a take all button?

2895
04:44:02,169 --> 04:44:03,290
No what just happened to that?

2896
04:44:06,180 --> 04:44:07,540
Yes there is okay.

2897
04:44:07,540 --> 04:44:10,950
Blueberries are ready.

2898
04:44:10,950 --> 04:44:29,819
Okay so now what can I do with the blueberries?

2899
04:44:29,819 --> 04:44:33,990
I can make like a blueberry blueberry flavored ale.

2900
04:44:33,990 --> 04:44:37,130
Blueberry ale yep.

2901
04:44:37,130 --> 04:44:42,259
Well I'm gonna do blueberry raspberry wheat beer.

2902
04:44:42,259 --> 04:44:49,590
Blueberry mead blueberry mead.

2903
04:44:49,590 --> 04:44:53,340
All right let's try blueberry mead.

2904
04:44:53,340 --> 04:44:57,689
What about like a banana wheat beer?

2905
04:44:57,689 --> 04:44:58,810
Is that weird?

2906
04:44:58,810 --> 04:45:01,610
Oh I need water.

2907
04:45:01,610 --> 04:45:06,939
Why does it hold on?

2908
04:45:06,939 --> 04:45:10,009
Has anybody ever made a banana beer before?

2909
04:45:10,009 --> 04:45:15,259
I feel like I would like it.

2910
04:45:15,259 --> 04:45:17,240
Banana beer?

2911
04:45:17,240 --> 04:45:18,599
That sounds actually kind of good.

2912
04:45:19,159 --> 04:45:25,080
Banana beer is amazing.

2913
04:45:25,080 --> 04:45:29,259
I wonder if I could track some down somewhere.

2914
04:45:29,819 --> 04:45:34,180
That actually sounds good.

2915
04:45:34,180 --> 04:45:39,319
All right wheat, fuel.

2916
04:45:39,319 --> 04:45:43,139
I need to make a second one of these.

2917
04:45:48,360 --> 04:45:49,880
All right we can do a mild ale.

2918
04:45:50,520 --> 04:45:54,889
So this is just ale yeast.

2919
04:45:54,889 --> 04:45:57,369
And let's throw some fucking blueberries in there.

2920
04:45:57,369 --> 04:46:04,580
Blueberries with some aroma and dual hops.

2921
04:46:06,099 --> 04:46:06,659
There we go.

2922
04:46:07,299 --> 04:46:08,500
That was so loud.

2923
04:46:09,139 --> 04:46:18,970
Oh wait what about a blueberry porridge with corn and hints of rye flavoring.

2924
04:46:19,689 --> 04:46:31,610
Another wheat beer.

2925
04:46:31,610 --> 04:46:33,880
That was a shotgun.

2926
04:46:35,860 --> 04:46:36,340
It was.

2927
04:46:36,340 --> 04:46:36,900
I'm sorry.

2928
04:46:39,209 --> 04:46:40,490
All right the next day that we do this.

2929
04:46:43,049 --> 04:46:43,529
Look at this.

2930
04:46:43,529 --> 04:46:45,610
I'm gonna I'm gonna have like three or four different taps.

2931
04:46:54,220 --> 04:47:00,869
Pies five three or to make pies.

2932
04:47:00,869 --> 04:47:02,470
I want to make like blueberry pie and stuff.

2933
04:47:06,490 --> 04:47:07,849
Jam shit.

2934
04:47:07,849 --> 04:47:13,939
I'm gonna make bread.

2935
04:47:13,939 --> 04:47:15,380
All right I'm overwhelming myself.

2936
04:47:15,380 --> 04:47:16,020
What am I doing?

2937
04:47:16,819 --> 04:47:17,060
Tea?

2938
04:47:20,020 --> 04:47:20,900
I want pie.

2939
04:47:20,900 --> 04:47:22,259
We'll do we're going for pie.

2940
04:47:22,259 --> 04:47:34,299
We're probably not even gonna get there.

2941
04:47:34,299 --> 04:47:35,419
Make apple pie.

2942
04:47:35,419 --> 04:47:37,700
I have a lot of wheat.

2943
04:47:37,700 --> 04:47:38,419
I probably make bread.

2944
04:47:44,680 --> 04:47:52,900
What do I need to make bread?

2945
04:47:52,900 --> 04:47:53,540
I already can.

2946
04:47:53,540 --> 04:47:54,659
I can make sausages.

2947
04:47:56,360 --> 04:47:58,279
Corn blueberry sausage.

2948
04:48:01,189 --> 04:48:01,509
What?

2949
04:48:10,500 --> 04:48:11,779
Corn sausage.

2950
04:48:11,779 --> 04:48:20,150
I don't know if that's gonna be any good but whatever.

2951
04:48:20,150 --> 04:48:21,029
They're gonna eat it.

2952
04:48:21,029 --> 04:48:26,630
Bro what the fuck?

2953
04:48:26,630 --> 04:48:27,130
What?

2954
04:48:27,669 --> 04:48:33,380
Hey if it's available I'm putting it on the menu all right.

2955
04:48:33,380 --> 04:48:36,409
I'm putting all this weird shit on the menu.

2956
04:48:36,409 --> 04:48:57,369
We're making 10 gold tomorrow with the rest of the raspberries.

2957
04:48:57,369 --> 04:49:10,869
Okay get a pear tree up.

2958
04:49:10,869 --> 04:49:16,259
Okay I'm gonna make two pear trees one.

2959
04:49:16,259 --> 04:49:16,900
Hold on.

2960
04:49:16,900 --> 04:49:19,459
Yeah I can make one here and one down here.

2961
04:49:19,459 --> 04:49:22,979
It's four by four.

2962
04:49:23,060 --> 04:49:43,220
Strawberry rhubarb pie sounds pretty good.

2963
04:49:43,220 --> 04:50:01,419
It's good with ice cream.

2964
04:50:01,419 --> 04:50:06,490
Sounds good.

2965
04:50:06,490 --> 04:50:13,669
It's better.

2966
04:50:13,669 --> 04:50:16,389
All right I want two pear trees and that's it.

2967
04:50:16,389 --> 04:50:20,180
I bought 40 of them but I'll never have to buy them ever again.

2968
04:50:20,180 --> 04:50:40,040
Get this rock out of the way.

2969
04:50:40,040 --> 04:50:41,430
Can I clear this rock?

2970
04:50:41,430 --> 04:50:42,150
Probably not.

2971
04:50:42,150 --> 04:50:57,479
Well it's all right.

2972
04:50:57,479 --> 04:51:10,229
Can I even fit it here?

2973
04:51:10,229 --> 04:51:12,889
Shovel on the rock?

2974
04:51:12,889 --> 04:51:14,970
Probably better tools eventually.

2975
04:51:14,970 --> 04:51:20,630
I probably can't remove it so we're just gonna have to be sad and go this way.

2976
04:51:20,630 --> 04:51:35,400
Really?

2977
04:51:35,400 --> 04:51:38,459
How much surface area does this rock take up?

2978
04:51:38,459 --> 04:51:46,619
Why can I I can't till this though.

2979
04:51:46,619 --> 04:51:55,659
Why is it so weird near the rock?

2980
04:51:55,659 --> 04:51:58,630
What the hell?

2981
04:51:58,630 --> 04:52:01,700
Oh my goodness.

2982
04:52:01,700 --> 04:52:06,040
Okay well and it's just going up here.

2983
04:52:06,040 --> 04:52:27,290
It doesn't have to look fine.

2984
04:52:27,290 --> 04:52:30,310
It just has to look just has to produce the fruit.

2985
04:52:30,310 --> 04:52:45,689
It's horrible.

2986
04:52:45,689 --> 04:52:51,400
Yeah see I can't.

2987
04:52:51,400 --> 04:52:57,529
There and then I'll put something else here.

2988
04:52:57,529 --> 04:53:10,310
I'll put like raspberries or I got all the stuff coming to the mail.

2989
04:53:10,310 --> 04:53:17,270
Okay cool check on the other stuff.

2990
04:53:17,270 --> 04:53:25,930
Cooking a lot of things.

2991
04:53:25,930 --> 04:53:29,560
There's the sausage.

2992
04:53:29,560 --> 04:53:30,360
Wheatwort.

2993
04:53:30,360 --> 04:53:31,720
There it is.

2994
04:53:31,720 --> 04:53:32,279
Good good.

2995
04:53:41,979 --> 04:53:46,139
There's the mild blueberry ale.

2996
04:53:46,139 --> 04:53:49,130
All right wheat lager.

2997
04:53:49,130 --> 04:53:51,340
Blueberry.

2998
04:53:51,340 --> 04:53:53,669
Bitter.

2999
04:53:53,669 --> 04:53:54,709
Dual hops.

3000
04:53:54,709 --> 04:54:07,130
Whatever.

3001
04:54:07,130 --> 04:54:09,770
All this dude has is blueberry ale.

3002
04:54:09,770 --> 04:54:15,880
Hey it's different and it's cool and it's unique.

3003
04:54:15,880 --> 04:54:23,529
Do you know the amount of people that are going to be looking for craft beer that come in here?

3004
04:54:23,529 --> 04:54:29,450
It's like oh blueberry malted pancake batter banana smoothie beer.

3005
04:54:29,450 --> 04:54:33,220
And they're going to go oh and they're going to take one sip and be like.

3006
04:54:34,619 --> 04:54:38,299
But it's a craft beer so I mean I think I get a little bit of points.

3007
04:54:38,299 --> 04:54:47,619
All right I'm ready to start the day after this.

3008
04:54:47,619 --> 04:54:53,259
I'm going to bed.

3009
04:54:53,259 --> 04:54:53,740
I'm waking up.

3010
04:54:53,740 --> 04:54:57,369
I'm going to be fresh and we're going to start the day.

3011
04:54:57,930 --> 04:55:09,619
Hello.

3012
04:55:09,619 --> 04:55:28,360
Okay that's all my material.

3013
04:55:28,360 --> 04:55:30,279
This is a mild ale.

3014
04:55:30,279 --> 04:55:34,360
Just kind of like a just a regular just like Bud Light I guess.

3015
04:55:34,360 --> 04:55:41,939
This one is the blueberry aromatic properties and some extra spice in it.

3016
04:55:41,939 --> 04:55:43,290
That's a wheat beer.

3017
04:55:43,290 --> 04:55:47,290
And then over here we have our our lager.

3018
04:55:47,290 --> 04:55:49,610
This is a wheat lager with hints of blueberry.

3019
04:55:49,610 --> 04:55:52,340
Bitter with some extra spices on it.

3020
04:55:52,340 --> 04:56:01,509
This guy thinks Bud Light is an ale.

3021
04:56:01,509 --> 04:56:11,130
I don't drink that much beer guys.

3022
04:56:17,209 --> 04:56:20,150
Raspberries are done too.

3023
04:56:20,150 --> 04:56:25,270
All right I'm going to do a raspberry strawberry rye beer.

3024
04:56:25,270 --> 04:56:54,869
All right what about a strawberry raspberry corn porridge.

3025
04:56:54,869 --> 04:57:00,380
Oh wait can I not do that?

3026
04:57:00,380 --> 04:57:01,340
Oh I need fuel.

3027
04:57:01,340 --> 04:57:01,909
No I don't.

3028
04:57:01,909 --> 04:57:02,470
Wait what?

3029
04:57:02,470 --> 04:57:29,799
This restaurant is disgusting.

3030
04:57:29,799 --> 04:57:36,490
Corn blueberry sausage blueberry corn soup.

3031
04:57:36,490 --> 04:57:43,099
Corn wheat soup or corn starch seeds.

3032
04:57:43,099 --> 04:57:53,560
We got blueberry corn soup blueberry corn sausages blueberry corn.

3033
04:57:54,119 --> 04:57:56,360
Beer we've got everything is blueberry.

3034
04:57:56,360 --> 04:57:58,900
I think it's gonna be all right.

3035
04:57:58,900 --> 04:58:04,439
I need I need to get butter.

3036
04:58:04,439 --> 04:58:06,790
Why can't I put butter in any of this?

3037
04:58:06,790 --> 04:58:30,090
Well can I just like have people eat the strawberries?

3038
04:58:30,090 --> 04:58:31,529
Dude apple seeds are toxic.

3039
04:58:35,619 --> 04:58:36,659
I think it's comparing.

3040
04:58:36,659 --> 04:58:51,930
Raspberry blueberry strawberry sausage.

3041
04:58:51,930 --> 04:58:53,689
I mean this is just a fruit roll-up.

3042
04:58:55,979 --> 04:58:58,540
This is just like fruit pectin right?

3043
04:58:58,540 --> 04:59:03,770
All right I'm ready to open the store.

3044
04:59:03,770 --> 04:59:09,459
I got what I want.

3045
04:59:09,459 --> 04:59:13,060
Wait didn't have an extra table.

3046
04:59:13,060 --> 04:59:14,020
I'm getting another table.

3047
04:59:14,020 --> 04:59:15,139
No I'm not who cares.

3048
04:59:15,139 --> 04:59:17,669
Yeah I'm getting one more table.

3049
04:59:17,750 --> 04:59:20,650
And then I'm done and I will open the store I promise.

3050
04:59:20,650 --> 04:59:31,340
I just need a bunch of wooden planks.

3051
04:59:31,340 --> 04:59:45,860
I want two more tables.

3052
04:59:45,860 --> 04:59:53,669
Blueberry corn muffin sounds pretty good.

3053
04:59:53,669 --> 04:59:54,229
Yeah.

3054
04:59:54,229 --> 05:00:04,790
Fence the farm off so nobody sees this atrocity.

3055
05:00:04,790 --> 05:00:17,159
Get away.

3056
05:00:17,159 --> 05:00:19,049
Mine.

3057
05:00:19,049 --> 05:00:20,090
My strawberries.

3058
05:00:20,090 --> 05:00:21,930
What are you looking at?

3059
05:00:21,930 --> 05:00:28,200
What do you want?

3060
05:00:28,200 --> 05:00:48,169
Small table and then we need four benches right?

3061
05:00:48,169 --> 05:00:49,290
I just need a ton of everything.

3062
05:00:50,250 --> 05:01:24,619
Is this game better than Stardew Valley?

3063
05:01:24,619 --> 05:01:29,380
I mean you can't you're comparing something to the Mona Lisa.

3064
05:01:29,380 --> 05:01:33,979
It's kind of hard to do that.

3065
05:01:33,979 --> 05:01:45,000
I think it's fun.

3066
05:01:45,560 --> 05:01:47,400
Obviously I've been playing it for five hours.

3067
05:01:47,400 --> 05:01:48,759
I've been having a good time.

3068
05:01:48,759 --> 05:01:52,279
It scratches that sort of make stuff, collect stuff, sell stuff.

3069
05:01:53,450 --> 05:01:57,180
I'm having a good time.

3070
05:01:57,180 --> 05:02:00,659
It's not the Mona Lisa but I mean how do you do that?

3071
05:02:00,659 --> 05:02:02,419
How do you compare something to the Mona Lisa?

3072
05:02:02,419 --> 05:02:04,540
Just that you can't.

3073
05:02:04,540 --> 05:02:28,090
The main lasso.

3074
05:02:28,090 --> 05:02:28,729
I know.

3075
05:02:32,009 --> 05:02:37,180
Bro the Mona Lisa sucks.

3076
05:02:37,180 --> 05:02:38,700
All right art critic Andy.

3077
05:02:40,200 --> 05:02:46,139
That's all right.

3078
05:02:46,139 --> 05:02:47,659
Mona Lisa's overrated.

3079
05:02:53,020 --> 05:02:59,270
Yeah but still it's one of the most important paintings in human history right?

3080
05:02:59,270 --> 05:03:00,470
We all kind of say that.

3081
05:03:00,470 --> 05:03:01,430
We all agree with that.

3082
05:03:09,779 --> 05:03:10,659
We don't agree.

3083
05:03:11,220 --> 05:03:19,029
Okay well what are the most important paintings in human history?

3084
05:03:19,029 --> 05:03:21,189
There's probably a few dozen I could probably think of.

3085
05:03:26,360 --> 05:03:29,880
Uh let us not forget Socrates drinking the poison.

3086
05:03:29,880 --> 05:03:31,799
Sorry that was probably loud.

3087
05:03:31,799 --> 05:03:32,439
People sleeping.

3088
05:03:33,080 --> 05:03:49,159
The Socrates when he's when he when he knows they've called for his execution

3089
05:03:49,159 --> 05:03:50,759
and he's got that finger pointing up.

3090
05:03:51,240 --> 05:03:54,680
And he's like I will drink this potion because I know it will kill me.

3091
05:03:54,680 --> 05:03:56,520
Therefore I have my philosophy.

3092
05:03:56,520 --> 05:03:59,080
Like that finger pointing up and everyone's like what the fuck?

3093
05:04:00,490 --> 05:04:02,330
That painting goes hard.

3094
05:04:02,330 --> 05:04:08,549
What is the name of that painting?

3095
05:04:08,549 --> 05:04:12,380
Socrates's um execution right?

3096
05:04:12,380 --> 05:04:17,479
Socrates's demise what was that painting called?

3097
05:04:17,479 --> 05:04:18,680
The death of Socrates yep.

3098
05:04:20,630 --> 05:04:22,229
I think that's a pretty important one.

3099
05:04:37,189 --> 05:04:38,549
Creation of Adam.

3100
05:04:38,549 --> 05:04:47,080
The death of Socrates yeah.

3101
05:04:47,720 --> 05:04:51,209
Um actually that painting isn't even good.

3102
05:04:51,209 --> 05:04:53,290
It's only famous because Socrates died.

3103
05:04:55,959 --> 05:04:57,560
Socrates and Plato.

3104
05:04:57,560 --> 05:05:00,680
I mean those people those were incredibly important people in our in our history.

3105
05:05:04,060 --> 05:05:13,770
Plato.

3106
05:05:19,110 --> 05:05:23,639
Guys um Socrates uh invented soup.

3107
05:05:23,639 --> 05:05:48,330
So what do you got to say?

3108
05:05:48,330 --> 05:06:00,950
Can a lot of the like modern philosophy be tied back to what Plato and Socrates were doing?

3109
05:06:00,950 --> 05:06:12,250
Yeah but I need to make two more benches.

3110
05:06:12,250 --> 05:06:22,119
I'm out of fuel.

3111
05:06:22,119 --> 05:06:31,110
Socrates invented critical thinking.

3112
05:06:31,110 --> 05:06:38,169
Um no was it Socrates that invented the the scientific uh theory whatever it is?

3113
05:06:38,169 --> 05:06:38,810
One of them did.

3114
05:06:41,139 --> 05:06:43,060
Who who no no no no they did.

3115
05:06:44,549 --> 05:06:47,270
The scientific method was Socrates wasn't it?

3116
05:06:47,270 --> 05:07:05,540
Who came up with it?

3117
05:07:05,540 --> 05:07:06,340
Galileo.

3118
05:07:06,340 --> 05:07:08,360
All right but yeah but whatever right?

3119
05:07:08,360 --> 05:07:13,029
Gala Galileo did.

3120
05:07:13,029 --> 05:07:13,990
Aristotle.

3121
05:07:13,990 --> 05:07:14,950
Galileo.

3122
05:07:14,950 --> 05:07:22,090
These people are important Socrates, Plato, and Franklin.

3123
05:07:25,750 --> 05:07:26,950
I'm kidding I'm kidding.

3124
05:07:26,950 --> 05:07:28,950
I'm not starting that up at fucking midnight.

3125
05:07:28,950 --> 05:07:30,389
I'm not starting that up at midnight.

3126
05:07:30,389 --> 05:07:49,639
I mean all of them are in hell but you know.

3127
05:07:49,639 --> 05:07:54,040
Did somebody just say all scientists are in hell?

3128
05:07:54,040 --> 05:07:56,840
Bro you need to fucking relax.

3129
05:07:56,840 --> 05:07:58,599
You need to relax.

3130
05:07:58,599 --> 05:07:59,560
Is that what you said?

3131
05:08:03,060 --> 05:08:03,700
What the hell?

3132
05:08:12,779 --> 05:08:15,299
Oh that's that's funny.

3133
05:08:16,619 --> 05:08:17,900
Every single one.

3134
05:08:27,770 --> 05:08:28,970
What did you say?

3135
05:08:28,970 --> 05:08:33,770
Can you just get your stupid Boston ass together?

3136
05:08:33,770 --> 05:08:34,970
You fuck Jesus Christ.

3137
05:08:34,970 --> 05:08:36,889
You're like the worst Red Sox fan.

3138
05:08:42,389 --> 05:08:43,189
What are you doing?

3139
05:08:44,389 --> 05:08:45,110
Leave me alone.

3140
05:08:46,069 --> 05:08:46,709
What the hell?

3141
05:08:47,430 --> 05:08:59,700
I just imagine some Boston fan just pissed.

3142
05:09:00,259 --> 05:09:05,669
You didn't even fucking talk about the fucking trade that happened.

3143
05:09:05,669 --> 05:09:08,709
Does he not understand the fucking Patriot season coming up this year?

3144
05:09:08,709 --> 05:09:10,229
Is he not fucking paying attention?

3145
05:09:11,209 --> 05:09:12,650
God fuck this guy.

3146
05:09:15,180 --> 05:09:17,020
Why are you not talking about the management?

3147
05:09:17,819 --> 05:09:18,540
General manager.

3148
05:09:19,180 --> 05:09:21,540
You didn't even say the Red Sox.

3149
05:09:21,540 --> 05:09:23,459
You didn't talk about the fucking Red Sox.

3150
05:09:23,459 --> 05:09:34,099
I've been here for over an hour.

3151
05:09:34,099 --> 05:09:38,700
I thought you were from Boston.

3152
05:09:38,700 --> 05:09:39,979
Fake fucking fan.

3153
05:09:39,979 --> 05:09:46,860
Was this Grotto Beast shit?

3154
05:09:46,860 --> 05:09:49,060
Grotto Beast?

3155
05:09:49,060 --> 05:09:58,659
Fucking loser.

3156
05:09:58,659 --> 05:10:02,040
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

3157
05:10:02,040 --> 05:10:02,680
Come on.

3158
05:10:02,680 --> 05:10:08,569
Grotto Beast.

3159
05:10:08,569 --> 05:10:11,369
What fucking minor league team is that?

3160
05:10:11,369 --> 05:10:13,400
What town do they play for?

3161
05:10:13,400 --> 05:10:17,819
I never heard of the fucking Grotto Beast.

3162
05:10:17,819 --> 05:10:19,099
Red Sox would destroy them though.

3163
05:10:19,099 --> 05:10:20,060
That's all I know.

3164
05:10:20,060 --> 05:10:28,220
All right.

3165
05:10:28,220 --> 05:10:29,419
I'm ready to start the day.

3166
05:10:29,419 --> 05:10:31,080
Let's put the benches in.

3167
05:10:31,080 --> 05:10:37,180
I've got a lot of stuff now.

3168
05:10:37,180 --> 05:10:40,150
This is going to be a crazy day.

3169
05:10:40,150 --> 05:10:55,590
This place is too small.

3170
05:10:55,590 --> 05:11:33,369
You're going to have to be a little more cramped I think.

3171
05:11:33,369 --> 05:11:49,909
Benches.

3172
05:12:01,139 --> 05:12:05,990
This now needs to move here probably.

3173
05:12:05,990 --> 05:12:06,229
All right.

3174
05:12:06,229 --> 05:12:07,430
I'm going to move this.

3175
05:12:07,430 --> 05:12:16,389
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3176
05:12:16,389 --> 05:12:17,349
What's going on?

3177
05:12:17,349 --> 05:12:37,959
What the fuck?

3178
05:12:37,959 --> 05:13:39,750
That can stay over here.

3179
05:13:39,750 --> 05:13:51,049
Where's your depth perception?

3180
05:13:51,049 --> 05:13:52,619
I'm just looking at stuff.

3181
05:13:52,619 --> 05:14:02,310
I'm just looking at stuff.

3182
05:14:02,310 --> 05:14:04,950
I want the big table where the fire is.

3183
05:14:04,950 --> 05:14:41,610
That thing costs extra.

3184
05:14:41,610 --> 05:14:45,110
Good luck anybody sitting on this side.

3185
05:14:45,110 --> 05:14:46,709
This seat sucks.

3186
05:14:46,709 --> 05:14:54,060
All right.

3187
05:14:54,060 --> 05:14:55,979
I need my one more bench.

3188
05:14:55,979 --> 05:15:06,009
Didn't I make a third one?

3189
05:15:06,009 --> 05:15:06,330
Shit.

3190
05:15:06,330 --> 05:15:06,650
I didn't.

3191
05:15:06,650 --> 05:15:06,970
OK.

3192
05:15:06,970 --> 05:15:07,130
Wait.

3193
05:15:07,130 --> 05:15:08,970
Do I have a third one in my inventory?

3194
05:15:08,970 --> 05:15:11,590
I need one more.

3195
05:15:11,590 --> 05:15:29,779
Do you make the restaurant in the game?

3196
05:15:31,110 --> 05:15:31,830
You make the...

3197
05:15:31,830 --> 05:15:37,099
It's limited to the point of you make beer.

3198
05:15:37,099 --> 05:15:38,619
You can add flavors to the beer.

3199
05:15:38,619 --> 05:15:41,979
Different fruits and different wheat and barley.

3200
05:15:41,979 --> 05:15:45,639
And you technically do make the menu.

3201
05:15:45,639 --> 05:15:48,490
I need to go fishing or something.

3202
05:15:48,490 --> 05:15:53,740
I don't know.

3203
05:15:53,740 --> 05:15:56,729
Make the tables vertical.

3204
05:15:56,729 --> 05:16:05,700
If I make all the tables vertical then I won't be able to see all their smiling faces.

3205
05:16:05,700 --> 05:16:07,139
At least for the people facing this way.

3206
05:16:08,779 --> 05:16:09,180
Come on.

3207
05:16:29,020 --> 05:16:32,409
OK.

3208
05:16:32,409 --> 05:16:35,529
It's time to go to bed and then open the store.

3209
05:16:35,529 --> 05:16:35,849
I'm ready.

3210
05:16:35,849 --> 05:16:37,610
This is going to be the biggest day so far.

3211
05:16:52,520 --> 05:17:21,720
Apple's ready or no?

3212
05:17:21,720 --> 05:17:21,959
Yes.

3213
05:17:21,959 --> 05:17:27,580
You take the raspberries and you can make a raspberry beer or maybe eventually whiskey,

3214
05:17:27,580 --> 05:17:29,349
vodka, moonshine.

3215
05:17:29,909 --> 05:17:35,430
I don't know what their plans are.

3216
05:17:35,430 --> 05:17:37,270
Game is still in early access.

3217
05:17:37,270 --> 05:17:38,310
So I don't know.

3218
05:17:38,310 --> 05:17:42,810
Take a raspberry corn sausage.

3219
05:17:42,810 --> 05:17:43,049
Yep.

3220
05:17:43,049 --> 05:17:43,849
You could do that too.

3221
05:17:43,849 --> 05:18:03,000
I think I want this just because I have a lot of firewood.

3222
05:18:03,000 --> 05:18:15,000
I like the footsteps.

3223
05:18:15,000 --> 05:18:16,389
It's nice.

3224
05:18:16,389 --> 05:18:32,840
How big is the area?

3225
05:18:32,840 --> 05:18:35,159
As of right this moment in early access,

3226
05:18:35,159 --> 05:18:37,560
I don't know if they're planning on adding a full town or anything,

3227
05:18:37,560 --> 05:18:42,200
but it looks like there is an up.

3228
05:18:42,200 --> 05:18:43,159
There is a down.

3229
05:18:43,720 --> 05:18:48,759
I think there is a I keep talking about a mine.

3230
05:18:49,560 --> 05:18:53,020
I don't know if it's up here.

3231
05:18:53,979 --> 05:18:56,229
Like what's up here?

3232
05:18:56,950 --> 05:19:01,849
OK.

3233
05:19:08,360 --> 05:19:09,639
Blocked off currently.

3234
05:19:09,639 --> 05:19:29,880
They're a waterfall.

3235
05:19:29,880 --> 05:19:40,970
Amusing me so much when you stand completely still while reading chat.

3236
05:19:40,970 --> 05:19:43,639
I can't multitask either.

3237
05:19:46,549 --> 05:19:48,150
Well, I let's put it this way.

3238
05:19:48,150 --> 05:19:51,750
If I'm walking and I look away from the screen,

3239
05:19:51,750 --> 05:19:53,029
I'm not seeing where I'm going.

3240
05:19:55,479 --> 05:20:00,200
I can't really know if I'm looking over here and I don't know where I'm walking,

3241
05:20:00,200 --> 05:20:05,299
especially when a game you need to have a lot of attention problems.

3242
05:20:05,299 --> 05:20:08,860
Anyways, I need to stop the read.

3243
05:20:08,860 --> 05:20:12,520
There's a bridge.

3244
05:20:12,520 --> 05:20:16,759
I bet you have to put a certain amount of wood or money to make the bridge go.

3245
05:20:20,900 --> 05:20:22,900
It looks like it's planned to be here,

3246
05:20:22,900 --> 05:20:42,200
but all that matters right now is opening the tavern.

3247
05:20:42,200 --> 05:20:54,180
We're going to do very soon.

3248
05:20:54,180 --> 05:21:05,049
All right.

3249
05:21:05,049 --> 05:21:06,490
Firewood stockpile.

3250
05:21:06,490 --> 05:21:16,630
Does it just go there?

3251
05:21:16,630 --> 05:21:17,909
Maybe it does it automatically.

3252
05:21:17,909 --> 05:21:18,520
All right.

3253
05:21:18,520 --> 05:21:19,319
Let's go.

3254
05:21:19,319 --> 05:21:21,139
Big day.

3255
05:21:21,139 --> 05:21:37,799
A lot of customers.

3256
05:21:37,799 --> 05:21:38,520
I need to be prepared.

3257
05:21:38,520 --> 05:21:40,040
I got all my food in here.

3258
05:21:40,040 --> 05:21:41,659
Cat has water.

3259
05:21:42,389 --> 05:21:43,590
Lots of food.

3260
05:21:43,590 --> 05:21:44,869
Tons of shit on tap.

3261
05:21:44,869 --> 05:22:15,880
Get a little bit of everything.

3262
05:22:15,880 --> 05:22:18,040
Oh, he ate the blueberry sausage.

3263
05:22:18,040 --> 05:22:30,419
Are we clean?

3264
05:22:30,419 --> 05:22:41,450
They're pretty clean.

3265
05:22:41,450 --> 05:22:41,930
Oh, shit.

3266
05:22:41,930 --> 05:22:42,650
I'm out of light.

3267
05:22:42,650 --> 05:22:45,500
I think I got it.

3268
05:22:45,500 --> 05:22:46,060
Hold on.

3269
05:22:46,060 --> 05:23:09,639
We got people in.

3270
05:23:09,639 --> 05:23:25,930
Good choice.

3271
05:23:27,560 --> 05:23:32,360
Blueberry raspberry sausage stew.

3272
05:23:32,360 --> 05:23:33,400
Good choice.

3273
05:23:33,400 --> 05:23:47,659
People seem pretty happy.

3274
05:23:48,299 --> 05:23:51,669
Menu selection.

3275
05:23:52,229 --> 05:23:56,409
Service here is terrible.

3276
05:24:04,380 --> 05:24:07,479
Oh, free sausages coming up.

3277
05:24:07,479 --> 05:24:30,340
Sausages are flying off the shelf.

3278
05:24:30,340 --> 05:24:32,700
People really like it.

3279
05:24:32,700 --> 05:24:42,819
What's the thing in the bottom right mean?

3280
05:24:42,819 --> 05:24:43,779
That flower.

3281
05:24:43,779 --> 05:24:45,380
I mean, there's not enough decorations.

3282
05:24:45,380 --> 05:24:55,900
It means it's dirty.

3283
05:24:55,900 --> 05:25:05,349
We're going to level up here.

3284
05:25:05,349 --> 05:25:18,709
How much inventory do I still have?

3285
05:25:18,709 --> 05:25:20,310
I can stay open for a long time.

3286
05:25:20,310 --> 05:25:40,619
As long as I have the candlelight.

3287
05:25:40,619 --> 05:25:45,900
Random order quests are available at the notice board.

3288
05:25:45,900 --> 05:25:46,540
Really?

3289
05:25:46,540 --> 05:25:55,669
Oh, my God.

3290
05:25:55,669 --> 05:25:56,310
Level up.

3291
05:25:56,310 --> 05:25:57,189
Oh, my God.

3292
05:25:57,189 --> 05:26:09,450
Did you call it the sus guy tavern?

3293
05:26:15,099 --> 05:26:22,409
Yeah.

3294
05:26:22,409 --> 05:26:23,049
Oh, shit.

3295
05:26:23,049 --> 05:26:23,930
Hold on.

3296
05:26:23,930 --> 05:26:33,139
Getting out of hand.

3297
05:26:33,139 --> 05:26:34,580
Well, I'm only one person.

3298
05:26:34,580 --> 05:26:34,979
Hold on.

3299
05:26:44,540 --> 05:26:47,180
And crack that person in the face while they're eating.

3300
05:26:56,659 --> 05:27:16,409
Is this a medieval tavern or fantasy RPG tavern?

3301
05:27:16,409 --> 05:27:18,169
I would say medieval tavern.

3302
05:27:18,169 --> 05:27:29,959
We've been seeing very many fantasy characters walk in.

3303
05:27:29,959 --> 05:27:31,000
Service here is terrible.

3304
05:27:33,659 --> 05:27:34,060
Relax.

3305
05:27:34,060 --> 05:27:34,459
Calm down.

3306
05:27:34,459 --> 05:27:34,939
Calm down.

3307
05:27:34,939 --> 05:27:35,419
Calm down.

3308
05:27:48,259 --> 05:27:48,659
Oh, shit.

3309
05:27:48,659 --> 05:27:49,700
What do you want?

3310
05:27:49,700 --> 05:28:00,569
The owner of this place is a cultist.

3311
05:28:00,569 --> 05:28:01,930
Why do you keep saying that?

3312
05:28:01,930 --> 05:28:21,180
I almost said four gold.

3313
05:28:21,180 --> 05:28:22,840
That's pretty good.

3314
05:28:22,840 --> 05:28:30,439
I want to go through all of the inventory.

3315
05:28:30,439 --> 05:28:45,240
This is definitely the stage where you get a little bigger

3316
05:28:45,240 --> 05:28:47,000
and you need somebody to help.

3317
05:28:47,000 --> 05:29:08,150
You need a staff member running out of beer.

3318
05:29:08,150 --> 05:29:09,029
It's Gruul.

3319
05:29:09,590 --> 05:29:17,560
Oh, shut up.

3320
05:29:17,560 --> 05:29:24,709
Get out of here.

3321
05:29:24,709 --> 05:29:24,950
Yeah.

3322
05:29:24,950 --> 05:29:39,580
Once we get to about midnight, that's when Gruul is on the menu.

3323
05:29:39,580 --> 05:29:40,860
Looks like that was the most popular.

3324
05:29:46,779 --> 05:29:49,659
That blueberry lager is the popular one.

3325
05:29:50,220 --> 05:30:07,060
Whatever that stew is, everyone's ordering it.

3326
05:30:07,060 --> 05:30:07,459
That one.

3327
05:30:09,799 --> 05:30:11,560
That was the one everyone said was poisonous.

3328
05:30:11,560 --> 05:30:13,000
They're all ordering the apple seed one.

3329
05:30:24,500 --> 05:30:26,020
This table is getting gross.

3330
05:30:31,880 --> 05:30:32,599
Time for the fire.

3331
05:30:46,229 --> 05:30:46,869
That's empty.

3332
05:30:47,669 --> 05:30:53,909
All right.

3333
05:30:53,909 --> 05:30:55,830
For a second, I thought this was a skeleton.

3334
05:30:55,830 --> 05:30:57,189
Like whose bones are over here?

3335
05:31:15,770 --> 05:31:21,459
People are ordering this shitty beer now.

3336
05:31:21,459 --> 05:31:24,580
Oh, shitty relatively to my blueberry lager.

3337
05:31:39,189 --> 05:31:39,669
That's it.

3338
05:31:39,669 --> 05:31:40,229
That's empty.

3339
05:31:40,790 --> 05:31:49,209
How much food is left?

3340
05:31:49,209 --> 05:31:49,930
We got a lot.

3341
05:31:49,930 --> 05:31:52,330
I can probably stay open until I pass out.

3342
05:31:52,330 --> 05:32:13,240
They're only ordering the one beer.

3343
05:32:13,240 --> 05:32:14,900
That's all I have left, right?

3344
05:32:14,900 --> 05:32:16,419
I have one more of those.

3345
05:32:16,419 --> 05:32:18,700
Yeah, there we go.

3346
05:32:18,700 --> 05:32:21,029
Hey, you got the last one.

3347
05:32:21,029 --> 05:32:22,150
Good for you.

3348
05:32:22,150 --> 05:32:35,369
Clean the throw up.

3349
05:32:37,930 --> 05:32:39,209
I can only move so fast.

3350
05:32:39,209 --> 05:32:39,770
I'm cleaning.

3351
05:32:40,330 --> 05:33:00,900
Does the health department know about this place?

3352
05:33:03,060 --> 05:33:06,840
The health department back in the old medieval times was,

3353
05:33:06,840 --> 05:33:08,520
hey, I found a fly in my drink.

3354
05:33:09,080 --> 05:33:11,159
I'm going to hit the bartender with an axe.

3355
05:33:13,240 --> 05:33:25,580
There's your health department.

3356
05:33:25,580 --> 05:33:26,619
No, they just ate it.

3357
05:33:42,779 --> 05:33:44,939
Yep, I can wipe it down.

3358
05:33:44,939 --> 05:33:46,659
There you go.

3359
05:33:46,659 --> 05:33:58,779
Enjoy your banana encrusted raspberry filled freaking vegan sausages is what I made, I think.

3360
05:34:02,409 --> 05:34:05,220
Hey, you got a bad review.

3361
05:34:05,220 --> 05:34:20,279
Now it's just down to the food.

3362
05:34:20,279 --> 05:34:20,919
All right.

3363
05:34:20,919 --> 05:34:22,919
Look at this 5.5 gold.

3364
05:34:22,919 --> 05:34:35,880
This is kind of filthy over here.

3365
05:34:36,520 --> 05:34:53,939
Hey, food is great, but the owner won't stop talking about the Red Sox.

3366
05:34:53,939 --> 05:34:55,689
Two out of five.

3367
05:34:55,689 --> 05:34:59,209
Yeah, right.

3368
05:34:59,209 --> 05:35:02,650
And then the Red Sox guy comes in and gives me a two out of five

3369
05:35:02,650 --> 05:35:05,049
because I didn't talk about the Red Sox enough.

3370
05:35:05,930 --> 05:35:07,459
Understand how I cannot win here.

3371
05:35:14,490 --> 05:35:16,409
You see, you guys understand.

3372
05:35:17,130 --> 05:35:32,299
5.7.

3373
05:35:32,299 --> 05:35:33,900
All right, I'm almost out of stuff.

3374
05:35:36,090 --> 05:35:39,209
What happens if I just serve gruel until everybody passes out?

3375
05:35:39,209 --> 05:35:40,169
Like, is that possible?

3376
05:35:41,619 --> 05:35:45,060
Can I just serve gruel until I go to bed?

3377
05:35:45,060 --> 05:35:47,220
I'm very curious, but I don't want to lose all this money.

3378
05:35:47,220 --> 05:35:47,779
It'll be bad.

3379
05:35:54,759 --> 05:35:56,040
No, we found him.

3380
05:35:56,040 --> 05:35:57,479
We found him in the morning.

3381
05:35:57,479 --> 05:36:02,200
Face burst into a bowl of gruel because it grew some sight.

3382
05:36:09,959 --> 05:36:11,240
One man Applebee's.

3383
05:36:11,240 --> 05:36:11,799
I like that.

3384
05:36:12,439 --> 05:36:18,150
All right, we're at gruel hours.

3385
05:36:19,939 --> 05:36:21,139
It is 1 a.m.

3386
05:36:21,139 --> 05:36:22,180
All I have is gruel.

3387
05:36:26,009 --> 05:36:27,849
And imagine complaining right now.

3388
05:36:27,849 --> 05:36:29,689
You've eaten all of my food.

3389
05:36:30,330 --> 05:36:32,650
You've eaten, you've cleaned out all of my inventory.

3390
05:36:32,650 --> 05:36:34,009
This is what I can make right now.

3391
05:36:34,569 --> 05:36:37,180
I really don't like the atmosphere right now.

3392
05:36:37,180 --> 05:36:39,900
Like, well, all I have is wheat and water.

3393
05:36:40,619 --> 05:36:42,360
All I have is rice and water.

3394
05:36:42,360 --> 05:36:43,720
That's what we have.

3395
05:36:43,720 --> 05:36:44,439
That's what we have.

3396
05:36:45,159 --> 05:36:56,169
Start fucking them up.

3397
05:37:00,310 --> 05:37:02,790
Yeah, how long can this actually go for?

3398
05:37:03,430 --> 05:37:10,310
It's 2 a.m.

3399
05:37:12,180 --> 05:37:13,299
Oh, wait, somebody's pissed.

3400
05:37:16,009 --> 05:37:16,729
Eat the gruel.

3401
05:37:23,080 --> 05:37:24,200
Why are they still here?

3402
05:37:34,200 --> 05:37:35,159
One gruel, please.

3403
05:37:36,060 --> 05:37:36,779
Have it right up.

3404
05:37:37,340 --> 05:37:41,500
I'll take a gruel.

3405
05:37:41,500 --> 05:37:42,779
I'll have a gruel, please.

3406
05:37:42,779 --> 05:37:43,740
Any more gruel?

3407
05:37:43,740 --> 05:37:43,979
Yep.

3408
05:37:44,700 --> 05:37:50,520
I mean, at what point am I just taking

3409
05:37:50,520 --> 05:37:52,360
what everybody has left on their plates

3410
05:37:52,360 --> 05:37:53,479
and just mixing them together

3411
05:37:53,479 --> 05:37:54,599
and putting it on another plate?

3412
05:37:55,159 --> 05:37:56,360
I don't have any more ingredients.

3413
05:37:57,080 --> 05:38:13,669
Should I kick?

3414
05:38:14,069 --> 05:38:14,470
Is that it?

3415
05:38:15,270 --> 05:38:15,990
All right, everybody get out.

3416
05:38:16,549 --> 05:38:20,020
All right, one more gruel for the road.

3417
05:38:20,580 --> 05:38:21,299
There you go.

3418
05:38:21,299 --> 05:38:22,580
All of you eating gruel.

3419
05:38:22,580 --> 05:38:23,540
Now get out.

3420
05:38:23,540 --> 05:38:39,080
Did somebody punch me?

3421
05:38:39,639 --> 05:38:52,299
Oh, no, it's a mess.

3422
05:38:52,299 --> 05:38:53,779
Yeah, I passed out.

3423
05:38:53,779 --> 05:38:59,340
I heard this place has super good gruel.

3424
05:38:59,340 --> 05:39:03,270
It's neat like people on Instagram talk about it.

3425
05:39:03,270 --> 05:39:05,349
Guys, I went to this restaurant yesterday

3426
05:39:05,349 --> 05:39:09,619
and they had the best gruel I've ever had.

3427
05:39:09,619 --> 05:39:24,380
It was super fruity and it had hints of raspberry.

3428
05:39:24,380 --> 05:39:26,700
You guys are not going to believe this spot that I found.

3429
05:39:26,700 --> 05:39:33,930
I wish I'd sleep.

3430
05:39:33,930 --> 05:39:43,139
Secret menu.

3431
05:39:43,139 --> 05:39:44,860
Vibes were amazing.

3432
05:39:44,860 --> 05:39:46,540
And I think that's probably where we're going to call it.

3433
05:39:46,540 --> 05:39:49,900
Right exactly at midnight exactly.

3434
05:39:49,900 --> 05:39:51,819
Exactly at 12 a.m.

3435
05:39:51,819 --> 05:40:04,020
It's 8 a.m.

3436
05:40:04,020 --> 05:40:04,740
Where are you?

3437
05:40:04,740 --> 05:40:05,139
Europe?

3438
05:40:05,139 --> 05:40:06,900
Good morning to you.

3439
05:40:06,900 --> 05:40:08,840
Yeah, we'll call it here.

3440
05:40:08,840 --> 05:40:11,590
This is fun.

3441
05:40:11,590 --> 05:40:13,990
I don't know if I will continue to play this,

3442
05:40:13,990 --> 05:40:15,909
but it was that was really fun.

3443
05:40:15,909 --> 05:40:17,049
It was really cute.

3444
05:40:17,049 --> 05:40:17,770
I liked it.

3445
05:40:17,770 --> 05:40:25,590
I think there's probably a lot more to do,

3446
05:40:25,590 --> 05:40:26,950
but it's pretty cool.

3447
05:40:26,950 --> 05:40:28,790
It's called Traveler's Rest.

3448
05:40:28,790 --> 05:40:29,669
Pretty comfy.

3449
05:40:36,150 --> 05:40:38,599
Oh, hold on.

3450
05:40:38,599 --> 05:40:46,540
One apple off of this whole tree.

3451
05:40:46,540 --> 05:40:48,700
One singular apple per tree.

3452
05:40:48,700 --> 05:40:54,250
This does not seem very sustainable.

3453
05:40:54,250 --> 05:41:06,459
That seems kind of one.

3454
05:41:06,459 --> 05:41:09,340
All right, that's it.

3455
05:41:09,340 --> 05:41:11,619
I'll see you guys later.

3456
05:41:11,619 --> 05:41:13,220
I'll probably see you guys on.

3457
05:41:13,220 --> 05:41:17,099
I'll see you probably on Monday.

3458
05:41:17,099 --> 05:41:20,229
I'll see you guys Monday, Monday or Tuesday.

3459
05:41:20,630 --> 05:41:22,950
Again, the SUS is going to be more of a general guideline.

3460
05:41:22,950 --> 05:41:26,310
I don't want to do like reverse delays and delays.

3461
05:41:26,310 --> 05:41:29,830
So they will not be a stream until early this week.

3462
05:41:29,830 --> 05:41:31,430
Somewhere around Monday or Tuesday.

3463
05:41:31,430 --> 05:41:32,869
Keep an eye on the SUS.

3464
05:41:32,869 --> 05:41:36,470
I will change it when I know for certain exactly when it's going to happen.

3465
05:41:36,470 --> 05:41:37,110
We'll see.

3466
05:41:37,110 --> 05:41:40,419
I say expect to stream early this coming week.

3467
05:41:40,419 --> 05:41:45,099
That sounds good, right?

3468
05:41:45,099 --> 05:41:47,500
And again, to touch upon the Grotto Beast stuff one more time.

3469
05:41:50,340 --> 05:41:54,729
We are exploring a digital version of the game.

3470
05:41:57,880 --> 05:42:00,919
Maybe just parrot one more time what that means.

3471
05:42:00,919 --> 05:42:03,029
We're exploring it.

3472
05:42:03,029 --> 05:42:04,389
It's being investigated right now.

3473
05:42:04,389 --> 05:42:06,069
We're trying to find a good way to do it.

3474
05:42:06,069 --> 05:42:14,650
And whether it is a mod or an existing platform or it is something standalone.

3475
05:42:14,650 --> 05:42:20,659
We are going to try to make sure I get all this information correct.

3476
05:42:20,659 --> 05:42:25,290
The channel merch that is Grotto Beasts has a game on it.

3477
05:42:25,290 --> 05:42:28,650
There is a trading card game on this merch.

3478
05:42:28,650 --> 05:42:32,810
And we're very aware that there's a lot of people that either can't afford it

3479
05:42:32,810 --> 05:42:35,240
or that don't really...

3480
05:42:35,799 --> 05:42:37,560
They want to participate in the game maybe.

3481
05:42:37,560 --> 05:42:39,159
They don't want to collect the merch.

3482
05:42:39,159 --> 05:42:47,110
So we're probably going to do some form of a digital release that we can be in control of.

3483
05:42:47,110 --> 05:42:48,709
And they're absolutely one thing.

3484
05:42:48,709 --> 05:42:52,150
I mean we want to get this right because I don't want to screw this up anyway.

3485
05:42:52,150 --> 05:42:58,139
This would not be a digital card pack opening version of Grotto Beasts.

3486
05:42:58,139 --> 05:43:01,080
It would just be the game that you can play.

3487
05:43:01,080 --> 05:43:06,119
And it would not be any additional purchases after getting it.

3488
05:43:06,119 --> 05:43:07,319
And we don't know what that means.

3489
05:43:08,119 --> 05:43:09,979
We're not turning this into a...

3490
05:43:09,979 --> 05:43:13,740
Oh yeah, go get the digital version and spend a shitload of money on digital card packs.

3491
05:43:13,740 --> 05:43:14,939
That's not the point.

3492
05:43:14,939 --> 05:43:21,830
The point is to just try to let as many people participate that want to.

3493
05:43:21,830 --> 05:43:33,590
Because obviously it's an expensive piece of merch.

3494
05:43:33,590 --> 05:43:38,090
And we've seen people obviously say,

3495
05:43:38,090 --> 05:43:41,290
The game? What's the game? The game seems kind of interesting. What is that?

3496
05:43:41,290 --> 05:43:43,979
Which the rules will be posted.

3497
05:43:43,979 --> 05:43:45,979
That's actually being written up right now.

3498
05:43:45,979 --> 05:43:48,619
The website version of this, by the way, the rules have been written.

3499
05:43:48,619 --> 05:43:51,299
They've been written. They've been up for a long time.

3500
05:43:51,380 --> 05:43:54,520
I keep saying that wrong and that's my own fault.

3501
05:43:54,520 --> 05:43:56,200
But the rules, the game is completed.

3502
05:43:56,200 --> 05:43:57,880
It's just we need to post the rules.

3503
05:43:57,880 --> 05:44:04,040
The rules on the website is currently being worked on.

3504
05:44:04,040 --> 05:44:05,479
I want people to participate.

3505
05:44:05,479 --> 05:44:07,979
I want you to be able to check it out.

3506
05:44:07,979 --> 05:44:13,770
And we want to make sure that the merch is valuable as merch to the community.

3507
05:44:13,770 --> 05:44:16,650
But I also want to make sure that we...

3508
05:44:16,650 --> 05:44:20,119
Whether it's a mod of something or it's something that...

3509
05:44:20,119 --> 05:44:22,759
We don't want it to be a huge money sink.

3510
05:44:22,759 --> 05:44:25,340
We just want it to be available for people to just play with other people.

3511
05:44:27,060 --> 05:44:27,860
It's important.

3512
05:44:28,340 --> 05:44:30,459
Whatever that means, you will know.

3513
05:44:30,459 --> 05:44:32,700
We will tell you very, very soon.

3514
05:44:32,700 --> 05:44:35,500
I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks we'll have a really clear answer.

3515
05:44:35,500 --> 05:44:46,549
Would be fun if it's electronic too.

3516
05:44:46,549 --> 05:44:52,229
Yeah. We want to make sure that there's still the value of the merch.

3517
05:44:52,229 --> 05:44:55,189
Because obviously it's a lot of money. It is.

3518
05:44:55,189 --> 05:45:00,150
So I want to make sure that that stays as like cool community merch.

3519
05:45:00,150 --> 05:45:02,310
There's also an opportunity to actually play the game.

3520
05:45:02,310 --> 05:45:04,549
I hope people understand that.

3521
05:45:04,549 --> 05:45:12,139
And there's a lot of other things to talk about.

3522
05:45:13,259 --> 05:45:23,209
Trust me when I say we're trying to make this as good and cool as we can.

3523
05:45:23,209 --> 05:45:23,849
Without...

3524
05:45:23,849 --> 05:45:28,409
Again, I don't want the digital version to be anything more than...

3525
05:45:28,409 --> 05:45:31,740
Hey, do you want to check out the game?

3526
05:45:31,740 --> 05:45:33,720
Here it is.

3527
05:45:33,720 --> 05:45:35,500
Whatever that means.

3528
05:45:35,500 --> 05:45:38,119
Take care of yourselves.

3529
05:45:38,119 --> 05:45:41,049
Just want to reiterate that one more time.

3530
05:45:41,049 --> 05:45:53,909
A one-time purchase or something would be cool.

3531
05:45:53,909 --> 05:45:56,470
Yeah, but that's what we want to do.

3532
05:45:58,619 --> 05:46:00,380
I don't know the exact things we want.

3533
05:46:00,380 --> 05:46:04,790
We've been talking internally about this for a little bit longer than you might think.

3534
05:46:04,790 --> 05:46:05,909
Of just what do we do?

3535
05:46:05,990 --> 05:46:24,810
What about online matchmaking?

3536
05:46:24,810 --> 05:46:25,770
Yeah, we're...

3537
05:46:25,770 --> 05:46:29,979
I don't want to count the chickens before they're hatching here.

3538
05:46:31,700 --> 05:46:33,659
Just be aware.

3539
05:46:33,659 --> 05:46:37,770
It's going to be some form of official digital version of this game.

3540
05:46:37,770 --> 05:46:39,689
That will have official support on it.

3541
05:46:40,979 --> 05:46:42,340
That we will just be releasing.

3542
05:46:42,340 --> 05:46:44,650
That will just have everything in it.

3543
05:46:44,650 --> 05:46:47,900
So people can enjoy the game.

3544
05:46:47,900 --> 05:46:52,250
We need to figure out exactly what that means.

3545
05:46:52,250 --> 05:46:58,740
Why do you like Applebee's?

3546
05:46:58,740 --> 05:47:07,110
Because it's waiting to give you a reason.

3547
05:47:07,110 --> 05:47:17,209
Is he going to do online microtransactions?

3548
05:47:18,569 --> 05:47:19,979
No.

3549
05:47:19,979 --> 05:47:22,139
No, that is not happening.

3550
05:47:22,139 --> 05:47:22,700
No.

3551
05:47:22,700 --> 05:47:23,259
That is...

3552
05:47:23,259 --> 05:47:24,860
The answer to that question is no.

3553
05:47:24,860 --> 05:47:33,130
Oh my god, not again.

3554
05:47:33,130 --> 05:47:33,930
I just got back.

3555
05:47:48,279 --> 05:47:49,299
Do you...

3556
05:47:49,299 --> 05:47:53,849
Whatever.

3557
05:47:53,849 --> 05:47:57,049
Unlocking cards maybe by winning games?

3558
05:47:57,049 --> 05:48:01,750
Yeah, it needs to be...

3559
05:48:02,229 --> 05:48:08,299
It needs to be an accessory to the merch, right?

3560
05:48:08,299 --> 05:48:10,299
It needs to be something that is not...

3561
05:48:10,299 --> 05:48:16,549
Because I don't want to have people pay a bunch of money again if they already own it.

3562
05:48:16,549 --> 05:48:20,220
Trying to be...

3563
05:48:20,860 --> 05:48:32,279
Trying to just keep my brain grounded on this stuff.

3564
05:48:33,080 --> 05:48:41,189
Whether it's a mod of an existing platform or something else.

3565
05:48:41,189 --> 05:48:42,389
It will be available.

3566
05:48:42,389 --> 05:48:44,150
I can promise and guarantee you that.

3567
05:48:44,150 --> 05:48:55,099
It will be available.

3568
05:48:55,099 --> 05:48:57,740
I've seen all the theories and all the people.

3569
05:48:57,740 --> 05:49:02,330
We're exploring pretty much every option.

3570
05:49:02,330 --> 05:49:07,189
We are exploring corporate speak.

3571
05:49:07,189 --> 05:49:08,709
We are exploring our options.

3572
05:49:08,709 --> 05:49:10,860
We will give you an update soon.

3573
05:49:10,860 --> 05:49:12,380
Just know that it will exist.

3574
05:49:12,380 --> 05:49:13,259
There you go.

3575
05:49:13,259 --> 05:49:19,180
And we'll see you in a day.

3576
05:49:19,180 --> 05:49:20,060
See you guys on Monday.

3577
05:49:20,060 --> 05:49:24,869
Have a good night.

3578
05:49:24,869 --> 05:49:27,349
Have a great rest of your evening or morning.

3579
05:49:27,349 --> 05:49:28,229
Good morning to you.

3580
05:49:28,229 --> 05:49:36,950
That was fun.

3581
05:49:36,950 --> 05:49:40,979
I respect that you're not promising too much.

3582
05:49:40,979 --> 05:49:45,529
There's already been a lot of time that's gone into this.

3583
05:49:45,529 --> 05:49:49,099
And a lot of thought.

3584
05:49:49,099 --> 05:49:51,500
So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

3585
05:49:51,500 --> 05:49:56,229
I don't want to tell you guys something that's not going to happen.

3586
05:49:56,229 --> 05:49:57,349
That's why we've been kind of...

3587
05:49:57,349 --> 05:49:59,799
The last, I want to say four or five days,

3588
05:49:59,799 --> 05:50:07,819
been really trying to trickle out info that's correct.

3589
05:50:07,819 --> 05:50:11,319
But the rules will be available for you to look at.

3590
05:50:11,319 --> 05:50:13,639
We're hoping the next day or so.

3591
05:50:13,639 --> 05:50:16,360
As well as the FAQ would be posted on the website.

3592
05:50:16,360 --> 05:50:19,020
So even if I'm not live, if it's there,

3593
05:50:19,020 --> 05:50:20,069
we will direct everybody.

3594
05:50:20,069 --> 05:50:21,750
We'll probably do a Discord announcement.

3595
05:50:21,830 --> 05:50:23,750
So people can go kind of peruse the rules.

3596
05:50:23,750 --> 05:50:27,939
With the actual game portion of this merch.

3597
05:50:27,939 --> 05:50:34,470
Take it easy.

3598
05:50:34,470 --> 05:50:36,389
I, of course, will give you updates when I get them.

3599
05:50:36,389 --> 05:50:42,099
Take care of yourselves.

3600
05:50:42,099 --> 05:50:42,819
Call your mother.

3601
05:50:42,819 --> 05:50:44,840
See you soon.
