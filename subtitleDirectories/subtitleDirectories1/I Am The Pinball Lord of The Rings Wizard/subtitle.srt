00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,280
Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here, and I'm here to introduce that I am the wizard, the pinball wizard. What are you gonna do now, wizard?

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,949
Welcome to Pinball Arcade, guys. It's free. Let's just season one tables. Let's go.

3
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:33,369
Oh, Attack from Mars. Big Shot. Black Hole. Black Knight. Look, there's a million of these.

4
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:38,420
I remember this one. I remember playing this in the arcade, the Elvira one.

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,750
Well, you like had to hit her in the boobs or something. Let's go.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,280
I don't know. I don't want to buy any...

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,909
It was a smash. One would say it was a monster bash. It was a smash.

8
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:02,039
It was a... Can I...

9
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,349
Welcome to Star Trek, the next generation. Play. Captain Picard and John Luke.

10
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,349
Motherfucking...

11
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:15,099
Welcome to the fun house.

12
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:20,599
Is everything... I have to pay for everything. It's supposed to be free.

13
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:32,560
Okay, so there are plenty of tables in this game. There's a lot of them. You have to buy them all, I guess, to like play them all.

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:42,469
This is what you get for free. You get Tales of the Arabian Nights. This is the only thing you get to play in this game, if you just download it for free.

15
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,159
Okay, let's go. Whatever. I'll deal with that.

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,659
Shoot, the lamp. There it is, there it is. Go up, come on. Don't let it go down the middle. Got to do the old technique.

17
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,030
Shit. The old technique is... Let me just show you. I want to get a chance.

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,030
The old technique is you hold the ball inside like the thing here. You'll see.

19
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,509
And it lets you take your time and figure out what you want your next shot to be. See? Ready?

20
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:16,650
What the fuck? Why can I not do this? I will get it. I'm going to get it. Just hold tight.

21
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,139
I'm going to get the super technique. Maybe I'll try it like this. No, that didn't work either. Am I out of balls? No.

22
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:29,139
I'm not out of balls. I got infinite balls.

23
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:37,830
No, please! I'm looking really embarrassingly bad right now, but that's... I'm trying to... Here we go, here we go, here we go.

24
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,830
Secret technique. There it is. See, now I get like as much time as I want to figure out what I want to do.

25
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:49,139
So I want to hit the big jello fat guy in the back. Here we go. Missed, but it's okay. I got the secret technique again.

26
00:02:49,139 --> 00:03:00,379
Jello fat guy. Blueberry jello. See? Hit him right in his butt. Hit him right in his butt cheek.

27
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:05,379
So another technique you can use in pinball games. This is an old secret tried and true technique.

28
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:10,379
Back in the arcades we used to do something called the burger boy technique. And what the burger boy technique is, is this.

29
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:17,000
You just mash intermittently on the keys and just hope to fucking God something good happens.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And half the time it usually works. See? I almost just lost right there. But no, I got like a super secret goal.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,250
Hole four complete. I don't even know what I did. Look at this. I got this. I'm doing like sick right now because of the burger boy technique.

32
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,000
I wonder how long this is going to last. I'm not going to make a cut. I'm not going to make an edit until I lose.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,889
I've like lasted longer than any other round. Oh my God. I keep hitting the genie. Shit!

34
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:53,819
Alright, this is going to be take two of the burger boy technique. I'm just, like I said, I'm not going to do an edit, not going to cut.

35
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,310
We're just going to do the mash the keys burger boy technique until we...

36
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,310
Okay, this is take three of the burger boy technique. Well, let's just go.

37
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:09,819
Take three of burger boy technique. Not going to make any edits, not any cuts. We're just going to hope to God this works.

38
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,300
There we go. That's like the fourth time I hit the genie and I got fucked.

39
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,540
That wasn't even my fault. It went behind like it sometimes does because these games are a ripoff.

40
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,100
25 goddamn cents? You want me to pay 25 goddamn cents to play a goddamn pinball game?

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Well, I made that wrong. It's actually the line from The Hobbit is yellowed his teeth and addled his brain and I messed it up.

42
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,540
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry. They've yellowed his brain. They've addled his teeth and yellowed his brain.

43
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:09,100
Come on. Come on. Come on. Hit the lamp. Come on. Give me this.

44
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Let me like get the high score in this one stupid free to play level I can play with.

45
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Oh, you want all the tables? You got to spend like 150 fucking dollars.

46
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:27,689
He wields the foe hammer, the beta, brightest daylight, but the dawn take you all.

47
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,689
I'm just doing like Lord of the Rings stuff right now.

48
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm not even paying attention to the game. Can this please stop?

49
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Jerma, please stop it. Okay, fine.

50
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,899
I'm going to try really hard this time to rack up a good score right here.

51
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,779
No more talking. No more like Hobbit references.

52
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,410
Hey, can you guess what movie I just like recently watched as to why I'm like saying all the quotes over and over again?

53
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,410
I wonder if it was The Hobbit.

54
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,899
Hey, well, the new The Hobbit movie is coming out in like a week or two, right?

55
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,399
So I mean, come on. Can you really blame me?

56
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,399
I can't wait. I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug.

57
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,899
It's going to be cool. How have I not lost yet?

58
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:16,800
Ooh, ball two is locked. Oh, no.

59
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,220
How many points am I racking up right now?

60
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,040
How am I supposed to banish the genie? I don't know how to do that.

61
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,069
Is there something secret?

62
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:36,949
Did I just get two and a half million points right there?

63
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:42,420
I think I did. I'll take that. Oh, I'll take that.

64
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,420
I'll take 1.7 million points.

65
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,550
Oh, back ends.

66
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,550
I've never been so happy to see a Hobbit in all my life.

67
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,550
That was like Sean Connery. Whoops. Wrong movie.
